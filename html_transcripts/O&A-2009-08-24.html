<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a vulgar and satirical comedic intro referencing American patriotism, immediately setting the tone for the broadcast.  The hosts then launched into a discussion about the difficulties of dating women with overbearing fathers, using highly offensive and crude language to recount their own experiences.  Anecdotes included one host's uncomfortable encounter with a girlfriend's father who lectured him on morality while secretly planning to sleep with his daughter, and another host's intense dislike for a girlfriend's mother, even fantasizing about violence and revealing he paid nearly $20,000 for her dental work.  The segment was filled with offensive terms and sexually suggestive humor.

Following a break, mixed martial arts fighter Fedor Emelianenko arrived in the studio, accompanied by several men the hosts described as "suspicious-looking."  The hosts, expressing both awe and nervousness, joked about his intimidating appearance and fighting abilities.  The interview, conducted with a translator, covered Emelianenko's career, opinions on other fighters (including Brock Lesnar and Kimbo Slice), training regimen (simple and without specialized diets), feelings about past losses, preferred martial arts style (Sambo), and his Christian faith.  The hosts continued their comedic banter throughout, using offensive language and making light of his fighting prowess.  The interview also discussed upcoming fights, specifically against Andrei Orlovsky, and included banter about the smell of some opponents and overrated fighters.  The translator participated in some of the humorous exchanges.

Later, Jason Ellis and his producer, Mike Tully, called in from Los Angeles.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to recounting a past Opie and Anthony Show featuring a tense interaction between Ellis and Jim Jefferies.  Ellis and the hosts repeatedly insulted Jefferies, using offensive language and crude humor to criticize his comedic abilities and personality. The conversation transitioned to Ellis’ personal life, including his children and his recent foray into mixed martial arts, and an uncomfortable encounter with LL Cool J.

A segment featuring Sam Roberts and intern David recounted their experience at New York Comic-Con, where they insulted cosplayers.  Audio clips played featured David's blunt assessments of various costumes, including those of the Joker, Scooby-Doo, and Super Mario.  This segment continued with further details of David's Comic-Con experiences, including an encounter with E-Rock, who described an intense meeting with William Katt and Robert Culp from "The Greatest American Hero,"  a show he loved intensely as a child, even claiming a childhood injury was a result of imitating it. The hosts discussed the show and the actors' careers.

The show then shifted to a news story about a Popeye's chicken shortage, focusing on a local news report that seemed to only interview Black people, followed by a humorous, arguably racially charged YouTube video about fried chicken.  The hosts also played and discussed a Denny's commercial featuring "Nannerpuss," a dancing banana, with intern David and Travis performing a comedically inept rendition of the dance on-air. A listener phone call and more Nannerpuss banter followed. Vinny from the Stress Factory and his son were present in the studio during this segment.

Mark Maron, in studio, read excerpts from a letter to his ex-wife, detailing his anger and hurt over their divorce and what he saw as her manipulative and financially exploitative behavior.  The hosts and Maron discussed the letter's content, with Maron expressing both anger and a sense of closure.  The conversation also covered his attempts to move on and his investigation into his ex-wife's new relationship.  The tone was informal and included frequent profanity.

Following the Maron segment,  a sexually suggestive segment featuring 19-year-old "Corinne the Naked Teen,"  brought in by intern Paul, took place.  Corinne removed articles of clothing on-air while the hosts made sexually explicit comments and jokes.  Listeners called in with requests, and the hosts encouraged Corinne's participation, though she seemed hesitant at times.  The segment included a game called "What's in Corinne's Pants,"  and concluded with Corinne's departure.  Further sexually explicit banter involving Corinne, Paul, and the hosts followed.  The show concluded with Opie and Anthony discussing old footage from their "Real Rock TV" show, highlighting awkward and inappropriate segments, including a Thanksgiving dinner and a potentially unsafe driving incident, featuring Rocco, and Opie’s wife’s reaction.  They promised to release more clips daily.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I don't want to be an American idiot, don't want a nation under the new mania.  Can you hear the sound of hysteria, the subliminal mindfuck America? 
[00:00:30]  Welcome to a new kind of tension, all across the alien nation.  Everything isn't meant to be okay.  TV dreams of tomorrow, we're not the ones who are meant to follow.  Well, that's enough to argue.  My country, tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. 
[00:01:00]  God bless America, oh beautiful for spacious skies.  Oh say, can you see by the dawn's early light, la cougaracha, la cougaracha.  Fa la la la la, la la la la.  Well maybe I'm the faggot America.  I'm not a part of a redneck agenda.  Now everybody do the propaganda. 
[00:01:30]  And sing along in the age of paranoia.  Tequila.  Hey, this is Jason Arse and you're listening to the worst.  The absolute fucking terrible, shitty shit can, dingleberry hanging up a dead cow's ass,  Opie and Anthony show.  They should have that.  They should say that instead of just the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And it's brought to you by Primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock. 
[00:02:00]  Is E-Rock black?  I fucking hope so.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am E-Rock.  And I am Primetime Sam Roberts.  Who is twittering right now.  I'm just looking at the twitter.  Oh, not Sam on Twitter, E-Rock Radio on Twitter as well.  That's true.  And this can be hysterical or awkward at the same time.  This has Patrice, Jota Rosa, and Anthony discussing fathers and daughters. 
[00:02:30]  Oh.  How they don't like dating girls with fathers.  Well, yeah, this could be hysterical.  This is hysterical and awkward.  Awkwardly hysterical and hysterically awkward.  Right.  Right.  And listen to it here on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You're ready to be fucked, man.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Am I so glad I've never had to deal with a chick's father.  They usually ditch the family when they're girls I know are like five. 
[00:03:00]  I thought you'd get to a certain age and you don't even like.  You don't acknowledge anyone?  I give my mother's, my girl's mother no regard at all.  None.  Like if she didn't like me, I'd be like, really?  Well, hey, things happen.  And that's a mother, you know?  Like the mother sometimes is there.  I don't care about her either.  Who cares?  After you get a certain age, you're like.  Yeah, I'm too.  And then it's awkward.  And in your situation, I know everybody's parents from now on are like, can I speak to you for a minute, my daughter? 
[00:03:30]  Excuse me, sir.  Why are you seeing this gentleman?  You're this guy now.  That's what they call you when they have this speech.  This guy.  Who's this guy?  Who's this guy?  Anthony's this guy.  They just, that's why I try to find girls with little or no connection to their parents.  The mother's okay because you could really kind of throw her around. 
[00:04:00]  You just find a low self-esteem circle.  Yeah.  The mother's no good.  The mother's no good.  You don't need that.  The father has been gone forever.  Yeah, you don't need some father interrogating.  You should be honest.  I got the father interrogation once when I was in high school.  And that, well, I was just out of high school, but she was still in high school.  She was like 16, and I guess I was 18 or some crap like that.  And he goes to me, he goes, I was over the house.  And he goes, let me drive you home. 
[00:04:30]  The father.  The father?  Yeah.  And he was one of these guys who worked for Caterpillar, the big machinery company.  Bill's motorcycle on the weekend.  Yeah, yeah.  One of those guys.  Mustache and just always had this scowl on his face.  Maybe that's all I saw because that's the face he made whenever I came over the house.  Maybe he could have looked like the nicest guy every other time.  And I'm like, yeah, he always seemed to have this scowl on his face.  So he goes, yeah, let me drive you home.  And I was like, okay.  I sat in the passenger seat of the van, and we'd go drive into my house. 
[00:05:00]  It wasn't that long a drive, but man, did he fit a lot of crap in there.  You know, I remember when I was your age, and he didn't even try to cut corners or anything.  I knew what girls were all about and what I wanted from them, and I don't want you.  So what do you think I am?  Yeah, yeah.  Not you.  Okay.  I'm trying to do that to your daughter.  And?  Yeah.  You're the sorry son of a bitch that had a daughter.  All of a sudden, I have to consider my morals, but you never did.  I'm going to smash your daughter as soon as I turn your back. 
[00:05:30]  Exactly.  And then just say sir at the end to make her feel better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How could a guy that was doing that during his youth give me any crap about it?  Well, you know, maybe he was a stiff during his youth.  That's the thing.  Don't you always assume that the girl's dad was a turd when he was growing up?  Yeah, yeah.  And wasn't a dirtball like he.  You know what I mean?  I don't mean turd like dirtball turd.  I mean like lame.  Like just kind of a lame, yeah.  Do you know what I mean? 
[00:06:00]  He, me.  Yeah, some kind of a lame, just not fun.  I can't even imagine.  Stick in the mud.  I can't even imagine what that line of questioning would be for you now.  Like, what's with this Brie Olsen?  Just write the parents a check.  Listen.  How much for this little delicious thing called your daughter?  How much for the girl?  Yeah, you got to do it with Blues Brothers.  How much for the little girl? 
[00:06:30]  Oh, what a world.  All right, 44 minutes with the wee one.  That's my offer now.  All right, man.  How are you?  Get in.  Oh, get in.  Oh, you got it.  Paper, paper.  45 minutes with the wee one.  Oh, you're an alien giver.  You got to go to parents.  You got to go to parents the way Puff Daddy had to go to Biggie's mom.  Right, right.  Miss, your daughter has a gift.  I really believe in her. 
[00:07:00]  I'm going to take her.  All the respect.  Just trust me, please.  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, and all that.  Oh, man.  But then they give you that speech, and then, you know, he dropped me off.  And I was the most, like, ugh, just wishy-washy, walk-right-over-me piece-of-crap kid at that point.  Right.  So I was just like, yeah, okay.  I sat there.  My body language said, beat me up.  Just verbally beat me.  I sat with my hands clenched between my knees, my shoulders real tight into my head, and I couldn't even look them in the eye. 
[00:07:30]  And now I would just kind of sit there and go, you're joking, right?  Would you really do that?  I swear, you know why?  I'm the most, like, jaded, sarcastic douche now that I don't even care.  Like, fathers now, the last girlfriend, her father, it was like, all right, shut up, you hippie.  You were probably older than done.  Yeah, exactly.  Probably.  What are you kidding? 
[00:08:00]  You would look stupid pretending not to want to do what you want to do now.  Yeah, yeah.  You're too grown of a man to pretend that I'm not going to try to sleep with your daughter if I'm with her.  You know what I mean?  And they'd be too stupid to think I'm not trying to.  Exactly.  So you go, look, I'm going to treat her nice.  Yeah.  I'm with her.  She's with me.  Worry about it.  I'll treat her nice.  Don't worry about it.  Just a high school guy that's going to take a McDonald's.  What do I make this out of here?  Your company or personal?  Yeah, what is this one?  Mr. Johnson?  Of course, I will have to inform you this is taxable to you because I will need the deduction. 
[00:08:30]  Make it out the cash in the memo for your daughter.  I'm going to talk about this on the air, so where's the business expense?  Your daughter is a business expense, like my computer equipment.  I want to get to the point where I can just sit a girl's dad down like I'm the wolf and just be like, can you afford oak?  Well, your Uncle Joey can.  And just start peeling bills off.  Peeling bills.  They're just happy you're treating it. 
[00:09:00]  By a certain age, though, they're just happy if their daughter's happy.  I'd rather just not have to deal with the parents.  I don't want to deal with it.  How can you say that, man?  The last girlfriend I had, Melinda, her mother, I had a fake, I had to put a goddamn smile on my face every time just to be nice for the girlfriend's sake.  Right.  Because we were together for quite a few years at that point.  And I hated her. 
[00:09:30]  I hated her mother.  I used to fantasize.  We'd be out to, like, I don't know, the Cheesecake Factory or having lunch somewhere.  The big old Cheesecake Factory.  Oh, yeah.  Big old Cheesecake Factory.  That's the big one.  Yeah.  Guess what this week is?  It's the Cheesecake Factory.  Oh, there you go.  You rub your hands together.  Usually it's Fridays. 
[00:10:00]  Or Chili's.  Last week was California Pizza Kitchen.  Yeah.  And now we're going to slide in.  And then I'd have to listen to some Mr. Haney money-making scheme that she'd have.  Well, Anthony, if you think I'm looking into going into real estate, all right, what are you going to do?  Well, I'm going to take houses and I'm going to buy them.  I was watching this Chinese fella last night about 1 a.m., and he said I could flip my house. 
[00:10:30]  That's what it is.  He's talking about flipping houses.  I'll flip you.  So I'd be watching her, like, eat, and I'd actually have a fantasy that would go through my head.  And I'm not even kidding about this.  I'd be like, I have the power right now, the physical power, no one could stop me, to lean over and right-hand cross this bitch right in the mouth.  Right.  And just to see that surprise look like, oh, my God, this guy just punched me. 
[00:11:00]  And brought, like, I know her jaw would snap, like, to the side, and she'd go, ah, ah, and fall off the chair.  And I just would fantasize about punching her in the face.  And just-  I hated her.  All of her real estate dreams would just be shattered there at the table.  All those dreams, yeah.  The image of my check being written over to her.  The-  I bought that bitch a mouthful of teeth.  You wanted to knock him out in the cheesecake factory.  And then I wanted to knock him out in the cheesecake factory. 
[00:11:30]  Her teeth were so-  Like, I couldn't even-  If she ever came to New York, it was like, oh, I'd like to, you know, meet your mother and Sal and stuff.  And, you know, my mother and Sal aren't the queen and knight in shining armor or anything.  But, you know, I couldn't bring this woman around with these friggin' black crayons as teeth.  Were they rotted?  Ah!  Whichever ones were left.  They were like friggin' like a hick.  Like some kind of hillbilly choppers. 
[00:12:00]  How much did they cause?  So I go, I go, you know something?  I go, if your mom's going to be around.  I go, maybe.  And then this was it.  Oh, you said this to your girl.  Yeah, yeah.  Like your mom's teeth is foul.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  I said, let's look into seeing what it would take.  That's how it started.  We'll look into seeing what it would take to get her some choppers.  To vals her up.  Next thing I know, she's already at the dentist and I'm getting bills sent to me.  So who was you mad at? 
[00:12:30]  Was you mad at your girl?  I was mad at everybody.  I was mad at the dentist.  But whose responsibility?  It should have been me to say, you know, what the hell's going on.  So you could have not paid that bill?  Yeah, yeah.  So who'd you curse out, though?  I cursed out.  Like if I said to my girl, check on your mother, you know, her feet are all weird.  There's some special shoes.  And my girl just said, my girl just got her mother her special shoes and then I got a bill.  Yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't curse her mom's out. 
[00:13:00]  It's not a mom's.  No, no, I was mad at the mother because I knew she was always like this.  The second you make an inkling that you might do something for her.  She's a smoocher.  She would just mooch.  Yeah.  She's a schemer.  Yeah.  How many of these little money making scams that she used to come up with?  Dude, I heard stories about her past history with men and ex-boyfriends and stuff.  And every one of them had seemed to gotten just screwed over by her.  She was living in a house that a guy used to own. 
[00:13:30]  Somehow he lost the house.  She got it.  They weren't even married.  Like off of some kind of weird, like friggin' carbon copy of a mortgage thing.  And she ends up going, well, goodbye.  Boom, shuts the door.  It's my house now.  So, I'm like, you know, I got to watch my ass.  I got to watch my ass.  What did the teeth end up running you?  The teeth over the course of the, I think, eight months or so that it was going over  was probably close to 20 grand. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, my God.  Of a mouth.  And then all I wanted to do was knock them right out of her face.  Did they affect her breath at all, the teeth being bad, or you didn't notice?  I never got that close.  What did mother look like?  I mean, other than the teeth.  Let me think.  Something from Lord of the Rings and not one of the people.  It was like some kind of a troll.  Jesus.  Looks like a troll.  Kind of a body that you can't really get a grasp of. 
[00:14:30]  I think she had scoliosis.  Oh, Jesus.  So, it was kind of bent up.  I thought I was a bridge burner.  Do you have a good relationship with any ex-girlfriend?  Is there any that you still like go, hey, is all your relationship in just a tower inferno?  It is literally the last one.  Yes, ended in fire.  Well, we know that one.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, but do you have any that you still go, hey, what's up?  You know, or they call you and go, I miss you or something, anything? 
[00:15:00]  No, there is occasional communication with Melinda, text-wise and stuff like that.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, how are you?  It's like kind of a, do you still have that table in the garage kind of a thing?  It's cordial now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's no reason to be, you know.  Listen, did you see your face?  I know we have radio, but he looked like, as if, yeah, there's no reason.  No, it wasn't her.  You just said her mother had garbage mouth.  I hated her mother.  She knew I hated her mother. 
[00:15:30]  But you don't hate Melinda anymore?  No, no, I never did hate her.  She was never like one of these vindictive bitches like I had gone out with every other time in my life where they all ended up with them just being pieces of crap.  Which girl was, because I'm new, which girl was Melinda?  Was that the last girl you dated?  That was the one I was with for like seven, eight years.  No, the last one was the stupid traffic girl from Channel 11. 
[00:16:00]  That one didn't work out very well either.  That one ended with the blonde girl inside, her clothes being burnt in a fire pit.  I like how there's zero.  Oh, that was, this is, that's the one.  That's fire, that's the girl in the closet, girl.  Zero anonymity either.  So that's why she's here so early?  Because she's scared to be by herself?  I thought it.  No, she's not scared to be by herself.  She doesn't know what old weather broad was going to come in and try to shoot her in the face?  She knows how to cock a shotgun.  Do you leave this one in the house by herself? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Do you?  Yeah.  You are a trusting ass.  You really are.  She ain't going to do anything.  What's she going to do?  She's going to go through your stuff.  Do you move your...  I got nothing.  When I'm dating a girl, I start, I actually take my cash.  If she sees where my cash is, I'll actually put it in another drawer because I'm afraid  that she's going to start stealing my cash.  You know what you got to do?  See, that's stupid.  Here's what you do.  You take your bulk of your cash that you have around your house and I have a little safe.  So I put it in the safe and then you leave some out, but you know exactly how much and 
[00:17:00]  where it is.  And if that's gone, then so is the bitch.  Yeah, but you know what I always did?  I used to leave stuff hoping that they would steal it so that I would never have to be really  committed to them.  I can always keep them.  You got that over their head.  As a side broad because she's a thief.  A thief.  I left stuff around to steal.  Yeah, that's what you got to do.  I agree, Patrice.  That's an excellent tactic.  Just let her hang herself.  Yeah, just so if she's like, where's this going?  It's going to the same place as my watch you stole last week. 
[00:17:30]  That you stole for your pimp.  That's what I get for making a prostitute my girlfriend.  You know what's hilarious?  My buddy, I had a buddy over at the house one night with my ex-girlfriend.  It was the three of us.  And we were all really drunk and he stole a candle out of my house just to see if he  could do it, right?  So the candle was gone and I accused my girlfriend of stealing it because it couldn't even fathom  that my friend would have done it as a goof. 
[00:18:00]  And I called her.  I was like, did you steal that candle that you really like?  She's like, why would you accuse me of that?  Excuse me of stealing it.  I was like, did you do that?  Dirty candles, you whore.  We know how you would have gotten it out of the house.  Where are you going to put it?  There could have been two stolen at once.  I think that's so big.  Oh, my God.  A candle seems like something that's so, like, cheesy.  That would almost be like, you could almost rationalize that, like, she wants something to remember you by and look at it at night. 
[00:18:30]  She would talk about this candle like it was a gold brick or something.  Really?  You know, these candles cost $30 and, oh, my God.  And she would light it every time she was over.  So when it disappeared, I was like, this chick, she stole the candle.  Why don't you take the candle?  No, I wanted it.  You wanted to take it.  That would have made some points, though.  I gave enough points in that relationship.  I bought enough milkshakes with two straws in them to carry me. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  I didn't mean, you know.  The amount of stuff I've given away to women.  Did you ever do that where, you know, you're dating a girl.  You'll, like, buy a DVD.  She'll be like, I love this movie.  I'll buy it.  Like, I bought Christmas Vacation so we could watch that at Christmas.  And then after we watched it, I'm like, just take it.  Go ahead.  And that's the stuff that hurts the most after when you're like, I gave her my stuff.  I gave her that.  I gave her stuff that was mine.  You?  Like, just because I was weak. 
[00:19:30]  Exactly.  Because I was weak.  It just drives me crazy.  I gave, like, some girl got my, I had a little video camera before the flip cams came out and stuff that we got now.  Right.  I had a little video camera with a flip out screen and everything.  It was pretty small.  But I was taking video with it and some girl that I was with was like, oh, wow, that's really nice.  Let me see.  So she's taking video.  And then I was just like, you want it?  Just, like, weak.  Will this, like, help me?  You like me more? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  That's what you're saying.  I know.  Ew.  I gave her.  You want it?  Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  These two bitches.  I hope you not want to.  Jimmy's worse.  Shut up.  I only said that with herpes.  I hope you want it.  You want it?  You got it.  You got it anyway.  Take it.  You're the one.  Sorry, I never walked down the street with a boombox playing Iron Man.  I'm not saying I wasn't a hero, but I'm a little, you know, now I wouldn't.  No, I wouldn't do that like now. 
[00:20:30]  It was a while ago.  Yeah, here's Jimmy walking down the street with a boombox playing this in front of this chick's house.  I know, but you're still the same douche you were when you were 15 in some ways.  You did say anything with Iron Man?  He just thought.  On the boombox?  That she would see him walking by and think, wow, he's Iron Man.  Oh, what a hot.  He's cool.  Roar.  In your eyes.  With his not one tattoo.  Because of skin disorders, you couldn't have the needles going there without causing some problems. 
[00:21:00]  Get an infection.  Some kind of stab infection.  So he's like, all his tattoos would press on from the Cracker Jack Bronx prize.  What happened?  It's his weak chest.  I never asked her.  I asked her out once on the phone, and she said, no.  Actually, I asked her on the phone.  With a wife be there, and one side of it was hanging off his shoulder because it couldn't sit up on it.  Did you, when you asked her out, did she say, are you the psycho that walks up and down the street with Iron Man? 
[00:21:30]  She was very nice.  She was like the hot chick.  And I'm like, I said, you don't want to go out with me, do you?  And she was like, no.  And I tried to be funny.  And I put, I said, oh, that's the way the, that's the way the cookie bounces.  Oh.  I did.  Shut up.  One of those moments.  How embarrassing, man.  It's awful to tell it down.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm uncomfortable now.  Why are there things like that that stick out from junior high and high school that you did to get girls that just, to this day, it's so embarrassing being shot down. 
[00:22:00]  You just, because in high, you just don't have that depression blanket yet to go wrap your, like, if I get shot down now, I'm like, who cares?  Who needs you?  You scuzz.  Yeah.  I'll go watch my plasma screen and order Chinese food.  I don't need anybody.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  It is way before, it is way before you learn that women aren't us.  Yeah.  And the stuff you, like, that's why I think all romance that guys have is made up from what we think girls want. 
[00:22:30]  Because I used to draw, like I said, I don't know what I said, but I used to draw, remember Rebus's?  You ever know Rebus where if you said, I cherish you?  I would draw it.  It's, you use pictures as the words.  Oh, no.  So if I said, I cherish, I would say, I would draw an eyeball and then I would draw a chair plus the word ish.  Or if I won't believe.  It's the name Concentration. 
[00:23:00]  It's Concentration.  Wow.  It's Concentration, right?  You should have drawn a little bit of condensation on the end of a blade of grass and then shbag after it.  And it just was, it just would be the same.  We actually just look down and go, mm, mm, mm, mm.  I cherish you. 
[00:23:30]  And you thought you were being, you thought you were being so like, what, endearing?  You're being creative.  This is another thing I know.  I want to have money for the rest of my life because I don't want to have to be creative.  Yeah, yeah.  Only broke guys have to be creative.  Hey, I'm going to make you a card.  It's going to be, I cut a lot of, I'm going to make an origami swan with a nickel inside and an eye heart you.  Like, I don't want to be creative no more.  You're going to have to do that. 
[00:24:00]  I want to go to K's Jewel.  I want my lower level creativity to be a K's Jeweler, Diane Ladd, special design, heart pendant for some idiot girl.  But other than that, to create my, to pour my heart out, to say this is how I feel about you, phooey.  Oh, when you're broke.  Here's a moldy record I found in a flea market.  It made me think of you.  It was 75 cents.  It's so special, though.  I remember you were telling me how much, for some reason, old rice made you feel good. 
[00:24:30]  So here's a sauce of old rice for you.  And you're like, just like, oh, yeah, yeah.  Those moments are exposing.  That's why they're embarrassing.  They're like, they're different than just like, yeah, you know, I picked up, I asked a girl out and she, you know, she told me to drop dead as an adult.  When you're a kid and you do something like that, it's like, you're exposed.  It's like, this is who I am.  Hi.  And they're like, pfft.  And it's exposing on a weird level.  It's such a huge buildup to that asking point that when you're shot down, it's such a huge letdown.  Like, you think for days and weeks on end, you're looking at the girl going, I got to get the right move. 
[00:25:00]  You're telling your friends, you're saying, what's going to go on?  And then all of a sudden, you're just like, all right, I built up the nerve to do this.  And then you get shot down.  And all those weeks of work and hoping and fantasies just go down the crapper.  No, because you have no concept of what it, like Patricia was saying, you have no concept of what it really is when you're a kid.  You have this idealistic idea of romance.  I remember I had a friend, she was my best friend in high school, and I was in love with her. 
[00:25:30]  And in my head, I was like, well, we have to get married.  She's my best girlfriend.  This is meant to be.  I wrote her a two-page love letter.  What a chump, dude.  No good could come of that.  I got out of work, I worked at this movie theater, and I called her, and I'm like, hey, I know it's late, but I have to see you right now.  Can I come over, you know?  Did you have the same size head in school?  Yeah, yeah.  Holy moly.  Still my awful gawky body.  Oh, my God.  My head hung two feet lower than my shoulders.  And I drove to her house, you know, all just the melodrama in the world, and gave her the letter and made her read it in front of me. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  And she read the whole thing, and she goes, I'm so touched by this, and this is, you're, I feel closer than I've ever felt to anybody.  But, and the but came, and she just let me down, and two weeks later, she started dating my best friend.  Oh, yeah, just to rub it in.  It was the biggest.  I thought she was your best friend, stupid.  My best guy friend.  Best friend with a vagina. 
[00:26:30]  We were all best friends.  They were, as he's smashing her, right behind the sheriff's office, Mr. Mayberry, hey.  While the friend was banging her, he could hear, like, what's that crinkle as her ass was on the letter he wrote?  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Where's the vote, B and Anthony, E-Rock and Sam?  Fedor shows up in studio right after the break, Sam.  It was very intimidating to see that man there.  He's arguably the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world, Fedor Milianenko, when we come back. 
[00:27:00]  And when Jimmy was looking at him, it was like he saw Santa Claus for the first time.  True that.  So here it is after the break.  The virus.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's E-Rock and primetime Sam Roberts.  Of course it is.  Sam, Fedor's in studio.  Unbelievable.  Some say the best pound-for-pound fighter, heavyweight fighter, in all of mixed martial arts. 
[00:27:30]  Fedor Milianenko was in studio with the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course with a translator and about half a dozen suspicious-looking people, well-dressed Russian men behind him.  Yes.  Now Fedor is now in Strikeforce.  Yes, he is.  He almost was with the UFC.  But he turned down their deal.  Of course our interview was before that all happened.  But there were still a lot of people going on and saying they wanted, they've been saying this for a while, they want Fedor in the UFC. 
[00:28:00]  Well, here it is.  Fedor and his Russian mob with him on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Not that it's necessarily the mob mob.  Just a mob in general.  Sure.  A group of people.  It's the worst.  The worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  We're all going to die.  We're all going to die.  Oh, my God.  We got Fedor in the studio.  See Patrice.  Once again, a real man walking into the studio, just humbling everybody.  Hey, Patrice, I bet you he eats meat. 
[00:28:30]  I don't know.  This guy isn't a, you know, a vegetarian, a vegan.  The first thing I ask is, are these guys going to treat me like they're in the movie Hostel?  Are these the Hostel guys?  Have you ever seen that movie?  No.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's the most dangerous one right there with the turtleneck.  The most dangerous out of everybody.  Holy shit.  Holy shit, man.  Wow. 
[00:29:00]  Could you do us a favor?  Could you hit him?  Fucking Fedor, man.  Fedor.  Yes.  We are, thank you for coming.  We're very happy you're here.  We're all big fans.  Big time.  Big fans of Fedor, and I don't even want to look him in the eye.  Why?  I don't want to mess this up.  I like to live.  How is he the most dangerous guy?  This is amazing.  Look at him.  No, I'm saying, dude, this dude is the most dangerous man on the planet Earth. 
[00:29:30]  So how are you saying, how?  He looks like a nice man.  He looks like a nice guy.  He is a nice guy.  He can just mush your face with his fist.  It looks like if I bumped into him, if I didn't know it was Fedor, and I bumped into him in the streets, I would go, hey, dude, watch your fucking self.  Like, I would think I would say that.  Oh, my God.  I hope this guy's translated correctly.  Are you saying that right?  Don't fuck it up. 
[00:30:00]  I'm not.  Don't fuck shit up.  Slowly.  It's with respect, man.  Does he get sarcasm?  Patrice, you know that Dutch don't get sarcasm.  Yeah.  Can you translate sarcasm?  How great would it be?  Russians get sarcasm.  How great would it be if Fedor just broke Patrice's jaw?  Oh, shit, as he's saying, as he's going, yeah, this fat nigga said he could take you.  What? 
[00:30:30]  Now we got Fedor laughing.  Tap out.  We got a smile on his face now.  Patrice, chill, man.  Holy crap.  What?  No.  Let me shut the fuck up.  He looks, even, Bobby was right there.  We were talking about the stare down before.  Yeah.  And Fedor just looks like a friendlier guy.  Yeah, he doesn't look like he's trying to intimidate you.  No, he looks like a really nice guy.  He could be the Russian Santa Claus.  Right.  I made him laugh. 
[00:31:00]  Thank God.  Yeah.  Thank God he got that.  So, question.  This is my real question.  I know he's fighting Olovsky.  But in his opinion, right, and I know he's not, he don't care about anybody because he  fought that giant Chinese dude in box.  Korean.  What's the Korean guy's name?  Who, who is he the most, if he had to take himself out of the mix, who is the baddest dude out there, the best fighter?  I'd probably consider a couple of fighters that are, you know, besides me. 
[00:31:30]  I'd probably like the first 10-year-old, Andre Orlovsky, Tim Sylvia, Frank Mir.  Frank Mir.  Frank Mir.  Yeah, Frank Mir, Andre Orlovsky, Tim Sylvia.  Those are, you know, those are guys in the top five, top five.  Is Rocky IV his favorite Rocky? 
[00:32:00]  Randy Couture.  Was that a happy ending or a sad ending for you?  Yeah, no, I've seen the Rocky movies, but I'm not that huge of a fan.  How about, um, I like the movie Knockdown with Russell Crowe.  Oh, all right.  I'm not sure what the English title was, but it was a movie with Russell. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, I probably, uh, no, the fighter, the fighter movie, the boxer movie with, uh, yeah.  That was, uh, what we call, we call the Cinderella Man.  Cinderella Man.  We gave it a little, you Russians gave it a cool name, we gave it a gay name.  We gave it a little, you Russians gave it a cool name, we gave it a gay name.  We called it a good name.  Knockdown.  We called it Cinderella.  Cinderella Man.  How about, you didn't mention Brock Lesnar.  Is Brock Lesnar, do you think, just, uh, getting too much press and too much attention? 
[00:33:00]  No, no, no, no.  I wanted to name Brock Lesnar, but I didn't.  No, no, no, not at all.  I actually wanted to list Brock Lesnar on that list, but you guys cut me off.  Who cut you off?  I certainly didn't mean to.  It wasn't me.  It wasn't me, sir.  It wasn't me, sir.  Hey, so, who, would you rather, do you really want to fright Randy Gator?  Do you want to fright?  Do you want to fright?  I'm a little scared, Jimmy.  Okay?  If you punched his neck, do you think you could fix it? 
[00:33:30]  I hate the fact that he pointed at me and they're both just laughing at my neck.  And his, his fist, his fist would just go right through.  He did.  No one would have become the shape of his fist.  No one looks like a Fader clone that didn't make it.  He looks like a Fader clone, but it didn't make it.  He didn't make it.  Is he bummed out that he's not going to be able to fight Randy Gator? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, that's a good question.  No, I'm not terribly disappointed because, you know, I like hanging out with him.  We're, we're, we're friends and I've got a lot of affection for him.  So, without meeting him in the ring at this point, uh, it enables me to, uh, to grow our friendship more. 
[00:34:30]  So, it's harder for you to fight somebody that you like?  Is it, is it harder?  Do you have, do you have to not like them?  Do you have to, do you have to not like them?  Well, yeah, I mean, in, in, in this particular case, uh, if I had my preference, I, I, I'd rather not fight him as opposed to another opponent.  Now, I, I think he knows that, I, I think Couture's a great fighter, but I think Couture's an older, I was worried about, I like Randy too, and I was worried about him fighting Fader because I think he's an older guy. 
[00:35:00]  He would have had serious trouble.  Yeah, but that's not what he told Randy when he was in here.  No, I told Randy, believe me, I sucked up to Randy too.  When Randy was sitting here, I said, oh, Randy, you'll, you'll kill him, Randy, he doesn't have a chance.  You're married? Is he married?  Do you, do you not?  No. 
[00:35:30]  So, is he, is it, uh, some fighting, uh, groupies on there?  Girls who love to fight him?  Did he ever bang a jersey chick?  Well, you know, groupies, I mean, I just wanted to hear that translated.  Dude, dude, did you translate what a groupie is, though?  You translate what a groupie is?  Yeah, Sibiyakas, yes.  Little Sibiyakas on the side, baby.  Sibiyakas.  Just some, you know, like, they just love him. 
[00:36:00]  Well, there are some girls who come to the hall or try to meet you.  Well, there are, but I'm a Protestant Christian, and I'm not...  Yeah, I mean, these type of girls exist, but, you know, I'm a practicing Christian, and I try to keep them...  You had the toughest...  Me, too.  Toughest fight...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You said Mirko Krokop was the toughest fight that you had, the toughest one, and he had a lot of trouble when he came over.  He lost a couple of fights. 
[00:36:30]  Why do you think he lost when he left Pride and came over to UFC?  You said Krokop was the most, well, one of the strong teammates that you had.  Boy, what do you think when he came to UFC, he had a problem here?  Was it like the cage, fighting in the cage?  Is it because of the cage or what?  No, I don't think the cage made any difference.  I just think that he got to a point where psychologically, I think he had some issues, and he wasn't able to overcome those when he came over here. 
[00:37:00]  I like the way you put, like, in your translation, you act like the character, you act kind of like him in it.  You put the emotion into it, too.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  You have the little angry stare, like you're saying it.  The inflation is perfect.  I heard something about you, too, which was that you kind of, you tried to not hurt your opponent too badly,  and then if he doesn't respond to that kindness, and he starts to be even more aggressive, then you really have to put him down. 
[00:37:30]  I've heard that when you go to the ring, you try not to worry about your opponent, but if he makes you evil, then you throw him more at him.  Is it true?  No, I don't think that's the case.  I just try to, you know, perform my work to the maximum of my ability, so if, you know, if I've got to take somebody out, I've got to take him out.  Who doesn't he like, like, in terms of fighters? 
[00:38:00]  Like, where you just, like, I'm fighting them in the street.  Who doesn't like you?  Who doesn't like you?  You've got to play with them.  If there are some fighters with whom you...  Well, they just don't like you.  No, I'm...  I'm with all fighters in good relationships, and I'm really interested to talk to them, to learn something new about them, not only in the fight, but also in the life.  No, I'm pretty well respected, and I... 
[00:38:30]  Try nobody talking shit.  I get along.  Nobody talks shit.  Nobody's talking any shit.  It's the same thing as Anderson Silva, though.  Like, it just seems like he's there, Anderson Silva's there.  I can't even name who else would be in that level where it's just people just don't want to mess around with him.  Like, people just go, all right, I'm just going to...  Nobody wants to badmouth him because they don't want to get back to him in case they have to fight him.  That's exactly what's happening. 
[00:39:00]  He likes to get to know the fighters.  And not only in the ring...  Has he ever been afraid of somebody?  He's going to say no to that.  Come on.  Fighters are afraid.  Fighters are afraid.  Well, yeah, I mean, we're all people.  I mean, you know, we get nervous, so...  With that, what is he afraid of in this world?  If it's not, like, another fighter.  Well, if it's not, like, another fighter.  Well, if it's not, like, another fighter.  What scares Fedor?  What if he says spiders?  What are you looking for? 
[00:39:30]  He probably is.  We don't care about his phobias.  We want to know what he wants to...  I'm actually curious.  I want to know.  Thank you.  I want to know.  If you put someone's eye socket through the back of his skull...  No, I actually want to know, because as a person, he's a great fighter, but, like, what, as a guy, you fight him?  It's just like a person, if you're afraid of something.  Actually, I didn't think about it.  I think there's some kind of fear, or...  I think there's some kind of fear, or...  I think there's some kind of fear, or... 
[00:40:00]  I think there's some kind of fear, as if you see a big whale.  Well, I haven't really thought about it, but I mean, I'm sure, you know, I've got some sort of concerns or fears.  Like, if I saw a big spider, I'd probably be a little nervous about it.  Like, punch it in the face.  It's just fucking phobia.  Like, why not?  Scared of the dark?  What the fuck?  Hey, can I ask you a question?  What style of martial arts do you...  I mean, uh...  Sambo.  Sambo.  But you have Brazilian jiu-jitsu, right?  No, I don't do jiu-jitsu.  No, not jiu-jitsu. 
[00:40:30]  I do sambo.  Sambo mostly.  So, I don't understand what that...  I really...  I don't understand what that is fully.  Sambo.  Well, surprisingly.  Where is it?  Sambo, it's one of the types of fights.  I think that...  I think that...  I think that...  I think that...  I think that...  I think that...  I think that...  I think that...  I think that...  I think that...  I think that...  I think that...  Yeah, well, sambo is kind of like my foundation.  You know, that's what I...  That's what I grew up with.  It's a national sport in Russia. 
[00:41:00]  It's kind of like judo.  And it...  It prepares you very well for mixed martial arts.  But once I started practicing mixed martial arts,  then I...  Then I picked up different disciplines.  Boxing, Muay Thai.  Right.  It's...  You can't...  In this day and age in MMA,  you can't, you know,  depend on one discipline of martial arts.  So you've got to become well-rounded.  That's what I was going to ask.  Like, my big...  My...  Where I was...  I most love watching martial arts  was back with...  When the Gracies...  When it's... 
[00:41:30]  Well, you know movies like Bloodsport and stuff?  Bloodsport.  Like, your...  What does he think about...  Okay, let's have a tournament  where it's like...  Okay, Sambo versus...  Versus Kung Fu.  You know?  Sambo против Kung Fu.  Против другие дисциплины.  Если бы был такой турнир.  Like, just your thing versus my thing  and what I...  What I trained for for years.  Nasha против твоё.  Like, would he put Sambo...  I think...  I think ours would win.  That's what I'm saying.  Would you put Sambo up against... 
[00:42:00]  Would he put Sambo up against...  He's all smiles on the couch right now.  Would he put Sambo...  Yeah.  Sambo will win, right?  This is not only based on the actual specialization and discipline,  but also the athlete that's practicing it.  Right.  So...  But Sambo is generally one of the most well-rounded disciplines out there.  I think Sambo is one of the most effective types of fights.  It's one of the most effective forms of fighting. 
[00:42:30]  Just top to bottom.  Do they teach that to the military?  Is that where...  Yeah, it's actually...  Originally, it's developed from...  There's two different Sambo's.  It's Sambo and Combat Sambo,  which is the military sport that involves striking as well.  Is Sambo like Akito's,  where it's made to get you out of there quickly?  Like, not play around you?  Like Akito, you should just run quickly,  or how Sambo,  like Akito?  Or is that your opponent is specifically for you?  Well, just to get you out of there quickly?  Is that the player that is coming to you? 
[00:43:00]  Well, no.  Actually,  it's designed to finish the fight as fast as possible.  Yeah, everything's designed to basically finish a fight as early as possible.  But if there's two athletes that are of equal levels, then it could take a while.  I think, as far as I'm concerned, you're undefeated.  The one fight...  The one loss that Fedor took was 17 seconds into a fight. 
[00:43:30]  It was an elbow to his forehead, which the doctor stopped the fight.  And you actually should have won, because the elbow was illegal.  Are you bitter about that loss?  You were worried about this one time, when he hit you with a leg.  And, of course, you were not supposed to win this fight, but you just didn't see the leg.  Are you worried about the fact that you had a defeat in your history? 
[00:44:00]  No, absolutely not.  But now I'm not worried about what God doesn't do to the best.  No, I mean, today it really doesn't make a difference.  I mean, you know, whatever, it's God's will.  And, you know, unfortunately, it turned out as a technical loss, but it doesn't really bother me.  At that moment...  At that moment, when I got a gap, it was, of course, a little uncomfortable, because I was out of the tournament.  Yeah, I mean, at that point, it was really upsetting, because it was actually part of a tournament. 
[00:44:30]  So I was eliminated from that tournament because of that, you know, technical situation.  So he avenged that loss eventually.  And he also...  What's the hardest hit he's taken?  I'm going to guess the Kevin Randallman drop on the neck.  Is there any hit he's taken that's been harder than that?  What was the hardest hit you ever had?  He thinks that it was because of Kevin Randallman, when he hit you on the neck.  Well...  On the other hand, I think, one of the most dangerous punches that I took, I missed a strike from Fujita when I was fighting him. 
[00:45:00]  And, obviously, yeah, Kevin also, you know, that was dangerous, because, you know, I could have landed the wrong way.  How did it feel when that seven-foot-four Korean fell on him?  How did it feel when this huge Korean fell on him?  How did it feel when this huge Korean fell on you? 
[00:45:30]  With all his weight?  How did it feel?  Well, it's still that they put it on the plate.  They put it on the plate.  Yeah, it felt like a big cement block.  It kind of just crushed me.  His forearm was on his face, and it covered his whole head.  The guy's forearm.  The hand was on your face, and we could see your head.  Well, yes, in fact, when I was there, I think I should have to go out.  Yeah, no, I just, I remember, you know, when I was down there, I was like, okay, I got to get out of here, because... 
[00:46:00]  Because it hurts?  Because it hurts.  No, it didn't hurt.  No, no, no, no, it didn't hurt.  It's just that I got the feeling that I was just kind of engulfed, and just, you know, just covered by this guy.  Yeah, he was.  That guy, right?  He bob-bobbed him.  Dude, he, from the bottom, I don't know how, I mean, he's, that's what makes him such a good heavyweight, is that he's a big guy, really strong, but he's fast like a middleweight.  He's really fast.  Yeah, it's just fast. 
[00:46:30]  Did you fight Bob Sapp?  Is Bob Sapp a male boy?  No.  No, you never fought Bob Sapp.  Was he, is he in the same thing?  No.  Bob Sapp тогда не дошел до меня, он проиграл Мирка Крокоп.  Yeah, Bob Sapp was in the same tournament as I was, but he lost to Krokop, and so I met Krokop in the finals.  Okay.  And how about, what's his name when he was in his prime?  I've never seen tape of him in Silver.  Not Anderson, but the other one.  Vanderlei.  No, we just, you know, it didn't work out where we didn't get a chance to meet. 
[00:47:00]  Does he, do you, do you like the UFC, or, I mean, because you guys have never got together, you've never fought in the UFC ever, right?  You've never fought in the UFC, but you like it, you'd like to fight it.  I watch the UFC fights, it's, you know, it's interesting to watch some of their fights.  But, you know, with respect, with respect to the organizers of the UFC, you know, we weren't able to come to terms on working together. 
[00:47:30]  I, I saw the last affliction pay-per-view, the, the Tim Sylvia fight.  I suggest if you get it, you watch all the fighters, because Fader's fights tend to not go too long.  Well, you beat up Tim Sylvia the way Tim Sylvia would beat me up.  How did you destroy him as easily as you destroyed him?  Well, you know, with, you know, with, with luck, you know, it was a quick fight. 
[00:48:00]  I love all his modesty as he's beating the shit out of everybody in the world.  He's like, you know, as I smash his skull, I want to lucky somebody's ass like that.  I would like to have such a happy fight as he's. 
[00:48:30]  Jesus, man, he's like a nice guy that knows how to, so where did all, okay, so if you, because I'm not a nice guy, because if I knew this shit,  like, if I knew how to fight, if I knew how to fight, I'd just be an asshole, like, so it's like, what was your fuel as a kid,  because I'm sure you train as a kid, what was your fuel as a kid to even want to be this dangerous?  What's the fuel?  Like, it's drive, like, you know, what is it, what is it to, yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Well, at the time, it was, it was really more, as an athlete, I just, I wanted to represent my country, this was, this was a sport,  and I wanted, I wanted to master that sport so I could, I could, you know, be on the national level 
[00:49:30]  and, and, and be well-known as, as someone that was, uh, the best at that sport and, and, for, for his company.  Because it's big, it's big in Russia, it's as big as...  But he never had a day job, right? He never did, this is...  There was no other job, you always played?  You have weight in the arms?  First, I was just, you know, I was fighting.  He's never had, like, a job, like, you know, at a hot dog stand,  He just said, he just, he just, he just said first he was beef, he just beefed in general. 
[00:50:00]  That's it.  No, I was just, I was, I was a trainer, you know, I trained people how to fight.  And, and I would, I would, you know, I worked in the sports club, you know, just kind of...  Was he a, was he a fighter, like, in, in terms of, uh, someone bumping into him at the train station, fighter?  Yeah, but if, say, you're a train station, and someone got you kind of hit, did you do it with him at a bar?  A bar fight?  Oh, I'd like to get into a bar fight with him? 
[00:50:30]  Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  You did you do it with him?  But not now, though.  Not now, not now.  I'm talking about just when he was a, before he was a train, weapon, when he was just walking down the street.  Yes, but if you were just on the street and someone was angry with you, did you fight with them?  No, in fact, I didn't have such situations.  Before the army, I was young.  After the army, there were other guys.  If there was a conflict, everything was decided. 
[00:51:00]  No, I mean, I was pretty young and then I went into the army  and I was just lucky not to really get into any confrontation.  And once I got into the army, it was dealt with differently there.  When is the last time you got beat up?  I mean, it's obviously not professionally.  Was it when you were in the army?  Was it when you were a teenager?  When was the last time you got beat up?  You were in the position where someone got beat up?  Or was it in the army?  Or was it when you got beat up? 
[00:51:30]  Like a couple of days ago, my friend beat me in chess.  Well, a couple of hours ago, my friend beat me in chess.  Oh, you like chess?  That's the other national thing.  Jimmy's a big chess guy.  Yeah, like big Bobby Fischer fan.  No, I'm kidding.  Physically.  What's wrong with you?  Bobby Fischer, you love him.  Who do you think is the next guy besides you? 
[00:52:00]  Who's coming up now that is going to be the next Fedor?  I don't know.  I don't think about it.  I don't really think about it.  But I know somebody will replace me at some point.  Maybe it'll be soon, maybe it'll be quite later.  Do you have a brother too?  You have a brother?  You have a brother too? 
[00:52:30]  Fighting?  Yes, brother is fighting, but he fights slowly.  Yeah, yeah, he fights.  He's really good too, though, right?  Yes, he's a good fighter.  Good.  Yeah, very talented.  Yeah.  Are you training him?  Are you helping him out?  Maybe to get into MMA?  Yeah, there was a time when we trained together, but now he lives in a different city. 
[00:53:00]  He lives in St. Petersburg, and he has different trainers, and he trains on his own.  Right.  I saw footage of you training.  It was like, it was outdoors, and then you were doing some wrestling moves, and it looked like it was almost in a little schoolhouse.  It was bare bones, not at all fancy.  It was very, very low budget.  Do you kind of train like that on purpose?  No, I just, it's the way that I've trained, it's where I've trained all my life. 
[00:53:30]  It's my hometown, it's basically the gym that I grew up in, and that's where I prefer to train.  And he doesn't do like, you know, a lot of MMA fighters in the UFC, these guys are just shredded, they go on these diets, and, you know, they protein drinks, and all that.  I mean, he doesn't do any of that.  He eats what he wants, he trains hard, and he pretty much is what he is, right? 
[00:54:00]  You're not like other fighters who eat, well, there's vitamins, and special foods, and everything.  You just eat what you want, and you train yourself very seriously, and you're doing these new things, like other fighters, or?  Well, I don't think that your fortunes in the ring are really dependent on all these gimmicky things that people do. 
[00:54:30]  No, I believe it, you know, instead of what, you know, pill you take or anything else, it really more depends on what you've got inside of you, your determination, your heart. 
[00:55:00]  You know, your belief in yourself, and God, and your training, and, you know, as hard as you work to get to where you need to be.  So I'd never make it in MMA, is what he's saying.  So he's never laughed harder, Bobby.  I could translate that one.  Do you think you could train a guy like this to be a fighter?  Or at least a man? 
[00:55:30]  Sam, show him your body.  Please.  He said, of course, I can train anybody.  You could train, really?  Well, there's one thing about, you know, working to have some serious results, and then the other thing is just training to at least, you know, get to a certain level where you're considered. 
[00:56:00]  How hard would it be to put a rear-naked choke on this chinless ass right here?  Could he just slip right out of it?  Could he just slip right out of it?  Because he doesn't have a lot of sherry.  Would you have to breathe him?  Yeah, as long as the head is on something, I'll find it.  You're going to put a chin lock with no chin. 
[00:56:30]  What do you do, dude, other than this?  Do you roll with him?  I am also his attorney.  Oh, really?  You're a lawyer.  You're a translator.  For M1 Global.  It's the promotional company that promotes fame.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  M1 Global.  It's going to be a hell of a pay-per-view.  You fight?  No.  You just wear cool sweaters?  Yeah.  It's cold, man.  I'm from L.A., so I had to go.  And you only take 2% from him, right?  Yeah.  I'm on salary. 
[00:57:00]  So, Orlovsky, I mean, it's kind of hard to picture anybody having a chance in a fight against you.  I mean, you've never fought Orlovsky before, I don't think.  What is it that makes this guy ready to fight you?  It's hard to imagine if someone can win you.  But Orlovsky never fought with you.  And he feels like he has a chance to win.  What do you think?  Well, what do you think about Orlovsky?  Orlovsky, and he said he's ready for this fight.  Well, of course, for any fighter there's a chance. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, any fighter has a chance.  Everyone can realize their best potential in a fight.  I like Andrei very much as a fighter.  He's very well-rounded.  He's got really quick hands.  Is he on the upswing?  Because he had some real heavy momentum for a minute when he used to wear his fang teeth and all that stuff. 
[00:58:00]  And he seemed to be the most dangerous dude in UFC for a minute.  And then he lost to Silva.  So, is he, what's his status now in terms of, is he, is he, should he be fighting Fedor right now?  Or is it like he's, he's lucky to be fighting Fedor?  Well, of course, of course, he's one of the most dangerous fighters in a row. 
[00:58:30]  And he's one of the most dangerous fighters in the world.  So, he definitely deserves to be there.  I mean, everybody's, I mean, you know what I'm saying.  Everybody's dangerous.  But it's like, okay, like Tim Silva, he was riding, Sylvia, he was riding high after he beat Orlovsky.  Or even like, what's, Rampage.  Rampage was riding high after he beat, who did he beat when he was riding high?  Oh, Liddell.  Well, Chuck, right.  So, that's what I'm saying.  Is Orlovsky on this thing now, like how Frank Mir is on, where he just won, and now it's time to see him, right, you know. 
[00:59:00]  Where's Orlovsky?  Well, Mir is going up high, and like Rampage when he beat Liddell, he also went up high.  But Orlovsky is going up high, or he's going down his career now?  I think Andre is going up high.  No, I think, I think, no, I think he's definitely on the rise.  He fought on the same card as Fedor fought when he fought Sylvia, and he looked great.  Right.  And he won his next fight after that. 
[00:59:30]  He's a bad-looking dude.  He's a bad-looking dude.  He wears his little fangs and stuff.  Zuby, Zuby.  He's a bad-looking dude.  That's what I'm saying.  It's just like, even if you know how to fight, you look at a dude like Orlowski.  He just looks just dangerous.  He just looks dangerous.  And it's just like, does that have any, like, what does he do to talk to himself to go,  this dude looks dangerous, and he is dangerous, but I'm dangerouser?  How do you feel?  You see, on Orlowski, he looks so dangerous, but how do you feel, but I'm even more dangerous? 
[01:00:00]  No, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  No, I don't even think about it.  I don't think whether I'm dangerouser or I just go along.  You know, I'd like to see, would you ever fight a guy like Gabriel Gonzaga?  Would you ever see yourself, because he impressed everybody when he beat Krokop with that kick to the head.  I mean, that was devastating.  You ever see yourself fighting him?  He's a guy I kind of like.  A guy like Gabriel Gonzaga.  He looked very beautifully when he won Krokop. 
[01:00:30]  Do you think he's going to have a fight with him?  Well, if he's going to have a fight with him, I'm going to kill him.  And what do you know about him?  Unfortunately, not very much.  Yeah, honestly, I don't know that much about him, but if, you know, if it comes down to it where, you know,  somebody can organize a fight with me and him, then I'd be more than happy to fight him.  Did he ever fight somebody that just stunk?  That's what I'm going to ask you.  You know what I mean?  That just made him want to puke, because it was like, oh, it just smells. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, smell literally.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't mean.  Smell literally or just stunk?  Yeah, smell both.  Well, you had to hit mine and his.  No, he's not going to say it.  No, there's some guys that really, guys don't want to fight because they stink.  You had to miss something behind his knees.  The Korean dude smelled like seaweed. 
[01:01:30]  What's the smell?  Smell like miso soup.  Oh, he added sushi.  I didn't know how to say seaweed in Russian.  I didn't know how to say seaweed in Russian.  Don't say seaweed.  How do you say seaweed?  I don't know.  I don't say seaweed.  Without just one good, one good, like just one mean answer, without the, we know he's a modest, nice dude, right?  Yeah, we know.  But really, just a really dude answer. 
[01:02:00]  Who is an overrated bum?  Well, tell us honestly, who, who, who in this sport did not deserve to be on the level that he got?  Well, and someone who is just not so good, but people think they don't.  If Rick Ross comes out of his mouth, I'll laugh.  I know he's a nice guy.  I know he's a nice guy.  Like, he's a respectful guy.  But who is just like, in his words, he's like, just man, I'd like to just show everybody that he stinks.  If there is a guy who would just want to show everyone that he's just weak, he's just not good. 
[01:02:30]  You're tiring him out.  I'm sorry.  Well, I mean, you know, if some guys in the ratings pretty high, and, you know, that means just people put him there.  It doesn't mean necessarily that he belongs there, but I don't really judge people.  So, you know, if some guy's in the ratings, and I got to meet with them, and to prove that I'm better, then I will. 
[01:03:00]  But I'm not here to judge whether or not he deserves to be there.  Ask him if, if, if Boss Rutan was at his peak today, would he be one, like, would he be one of the baddest motherfuckers out there?  Oh, you know.  Without cursing, because he's a...  Oh, sorry, baddest person on the planet.  He's a question, probably.  Praise God.  If Boss Rutan was at his peak today, he was one of the best fighters in the world.  Uh-oh.  But to, that Boss was a champion in UFC, it already speaks a lot. 
[01:03:30]  Well, the fact that he was a UFC champion already speaks volumes.  That's it?  That's all I need to say.  Okay.  Do you think that, do you think that in an attempt to make MMA bigger here, like, they're pushing certain guys through faster.  Like, Brock Lesnar had, like, what, four fights before he got a shot at the championship.  He's a great fighter, but he only had four fights.  Or Kimbo Slice was made this, uh, this household name before he had ever proven himself in mixed martial arts. 
[01:04:00]  Is that just an attempt to make MMA bigger, or how do you feel about that?  How do you feel about it, like Lesnar and Kimbo Slice, where they don't have so many fights, but they're pushing them very quickly?  And do you think that it's because people want to grow MMA more quickly than they're ready?  Or do you think that there are so many fights that after four fights, they're already one of the best?  How do you think that, you know, they're playing for those fights?  Yes, there are obviously players that, you know, who are beaucoup more likely to achieve some talent, which can be the best. 
[01:04:30]  There's, of course, players that want to see it and because they are running their hardest...  Well, they're running their best grip, more quickly than other people who start jumping with the Perfection.  Well, I mean, there's fighters that, you know, have kind of paid their dues  and with their talent and their pedigree have really, you know, kind of gone through the ranks. 
[01:05:00]  And there's kind of one category of fighters.  And there's another category of fighters that people really want to see.  And so as a result, you know, they're marketable.  And so they're kind of put on a faster track.  And, you know, if it's good for the sport, that's fine.  So what do you do?  Do you train, they say, what, two or three times a day you train?  And how far before a fight do you actually stop?  Do you give yourself a day or two before a fight where you do very light training?  I mean, because I've read two or three times a day.  You train somewhere two or three times a day. 
[01:05:30]  But when you stop before the fight, a week before the fight or a day before the fight,  when you stop training for two or three days, as you usually train before the fight?  About ten days before the fight, I'm basically done with my training.  The training's the hardest part.  How come he fights every New Year's?  What do you say every New Year's, Diyos?  Well, because they ask me to.  That's it?  They invite me to. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  Is he bummed out that Pride is gone?  I mean, I know it's dream now, but does he miss Pride?  Are you bummed out that Pride doesn't exist?  Are you bummed out that Pride doesn't exist?  Are you bummed out that Pride doesn't exist?  How does it exist?  Well, of course, Pride took his role in MMA world, and I think he did a lot for the development of this sport.  Yeah, no, it's disappointing because, you know, Pride had its place in not only the MMA world, but also its history, and it contributed a lot to the growth of MMA, so it's sad to not see it exist. 
[01:06:30]  Because the Japanese fans, performing in front of them, they're really respectful, they don't scream out, they, you know, it's a different atmosphere performing in Japan than it is performing in Anaheim, California, with a bunch of savages who just drank a six-pack in the parking lot.  Well, because it's different than when you were in Pride, the Japanese, they have a lot of respect, they have a lot of respect, they have a lot of respect, but it's a difference between being in Anaheim, where people just drank a lot of beer and they shout out like a savage. 
[01:07:00]  Say it right.  Come on, that wasn't bad.  Dude, you really are making us nervous, because one slip and we can all be dead.  He said, please, translate your mind, because if you're not so right, you're going to be angry, so we're afraid.  You really are improv in this thing, and it's...  Yeah, since we heard Sushi, we know where it's coming.  He's just an actor.  We're big fans of this. 
[01:07:30]  He has a stare, like, that you go, you just want to go, and then you want to say to...  You want to say to Faito with all due respect, and then you want to say to these dudes all due respect.  Yeah.  They just don't want to say that I'm wrong, because, you know, you're so smart, and then, more importantly, you have four guys behind you, who are sitting there, who are also angry at me.  But Trace, he gives them first shot.  He gives them first shot before he even started to do.  He gives them first shot before he even started to do. 
[01:08:00]  They'll deal with you.  They'll deal with you.  They're better at all, because they're so scary, that they're not even on the ring.  Yeah, honestly, you really shouldn't piss those guys off, because they're such angry people, they don't even let them into the ring.  Excuse me for a second.  Is this your family?  Is that your relatives?  It's like four or five guys on the couch.  Yes, one of them is my trainer, Vladimir Mihalovic Voronov.  He looks fun.  He's waiting to have somebody beat up right now. 
[01:08:30]  Trainer.  Vadim Finkelstein is my manager.  Finkelstein?  Finkelstein?  Of course.  Which one's that?  Can I pick which one that is?  They really do rule the world, okay?  Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  Finkelstein?  We all got something in common, all of us.  Oh, shit.  All right, go ahead.  Finkelstein?  Who's the other?  These are all my friends, and the two guys are my friends, Slava and Dennis. 
[01:09:00]  Is he a fan of Yakov Smirnov?  He's nice, Yakov Smirnov.  A lot of comedy.  No, Russians don't know who he is.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Yeah, and that's really good to know.  Does he like comedy?  Like, who's his favorite comedian?  There's a comedy.  Who's your favorite comedian?  Oh, of course.  You don't know?  Actors?  Wait, there's no word to say comedy in Russian.  Stand-up comedy?  In Russian, there's a word comedy. 
[01:09:30]  Is there comedy?  Of course.  Of course.  Yeah, of course.  There is.  But what's his favorite movie?  What's your favorite movie?  What do you want to date him?  What kind of question is that?  I just want to know.  So when I watch him on TV, I can say, you know, his favorite movie is...  What's some of your fears?  One of his favorite movies is Die Hard with Bruce Willis.  All right.  He lives in my building.  Now, Jimmy, we're repeating that name for just weeks. 
[01:10:00]  I say hi to him.  Ignore me.  He says, I'm good with him.  But he's not good with me.  Yeah, that's not part of me.  Who lives in your building?  Tell him I say hi.  I'm a big fan.  Tell him he's amazing, dude, because we're all...  We are big fans.  I mean, and not because he's sitting here.  He's the...  He's the...  He's the real dude.  We're just like, he's the baddest dude walking around, man.  For real.  And to show our respect for you, you can take Sam with you.  He's yours.  You can take Sam with you.  Yes.  We're giving you a slave. 
[01:10:30]  We're giving you an American human slave.  Hello, this is Fedor.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Hello, this is Fedor.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  It's the worst, the worst moment of O.P. and Anthony.  The worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Sam and E-Rock with you, as always.  After the break, the newest addition to the virus channel, E-Rock.  No, I've been here for a while.  It's Jason Ellis.  That's right, Jason Ellis.  And I believe we may have set up a highly technologically satellite way of linking us with the L.A. studios. 
[01:11:00]  We may hear from Jason Ellis and his producer, Tully, for the intro for the next bit.  I don't know if it's going to happen, but stay tuned and see if it does.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Ready, E-Rock?  I hate you.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  I am E-Rock.  And I am primetime Sam Roberts.  And this year was a lot of firsts.  A lot of firsts.  Besides celebrity deaths, it was a lot of firsts. 
[01:11:30]  You lost your virginity.  No, that is not true.  Okay, well, one day it will happen.  No, it won't.  All right.  I've tried.  I've tried paying.  It doesn't work.  Aw.  This is a year of firsts.  This is when we had a new addition to the virus channel.  Yes.  E-Rock.  No, I've been here.  Oh.  I've actually been here longer than you.  Really?  People don't pay attention.  People don't.  No, I'm talking about Jason Ellis.  That's right.  The first time Jason Ellis was in studio along with Jim Jeffries, who I guess didn't...  A fellow Aussie.  Yeah, and Jeffries didn't quite go along with his brand of... 
[01:12:00]  What's...  E-Rock.  No, don't do this.  I'm getting something in my head.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  Oh, somebody wants to join us from L.A.  It's Mike Tully and Jason Ellis live from Faction in Los Angeles.  Jason and Mike, can you hear us?  You want me to fucking talk?  Who's this?  You talk.  Thank you, Sam and E-Rock.  Yeah, what's up?  I'm Jason Ellis.  In New York City.  I love Sam.  I'm a big E-Rock fan.  E-Rock?  Yeah.  Like, is he a dancer?  I think he used to be.  Right.  You remember the Fly Girls?  Yeah, you probably still get laid with E-Rock. 
[01:12:30]  Think he's got like a medallion or something?  I would hope so.  Good for him.  You don't put rock in your name if you're not rocking.  You can.  You better not.  Sometimes people put big in their name and they're not big.  You can only do that if you're incredibly small.  In Australia, redhead dudes are called blue.  Really?  Yeah.  What's with Australia?  I don't know.  That's why I moved here.  I get you.  Anyway.  So they are in New York City.  Good for them.  Sam and E-Rock.  It's a hell of a town.  That's where everybody has herpes.  That's right.  Meanwhile, here in Los Angeles.  Do we have the stats on Los Angeles? 
[01:13:00]  AIDS.  We're a big AIDS state.  It's always been a West Coast thing.  Big fan.  Go AIDS.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Sun, surf, HIV.  Yeah.  So, Jason, do you recall the first time you were on the Opie and Anthony show?  I totally recall that.  As if it were yesterday.  It was like it was yesterday.  I remember that there was an Australian dude on there who was fucking annoying the shit out of me.  I think the feeling was mutual.  Yeah.  Well, that happens. 
[01:13:30]  His name is Jim Jeffries.  Yeah.  He can truck a cock.  Okay.  Yeah.  I wasn't in the studio.  Right.  And I did feel a little weird that day.  You know when you just don't have it?  Yes.  I didn't have it.  I have a deal with that almost every day.  Right.  I was like, man, what a bad time to not have it because it's the Opie and Anthony show  and these people are fucking Megatron and they're giving you a chance.  I just showed up to the World Series without my fastball.  Yeah, you're sucking a dog dick right now on the radio and then some Aussie dude's fucking  making every now and then a little fucking interesting fucking point about nothing. 
[01:14:00]  But I should have just shut up and let him talk.  Nonetheless, this clip remains a classic.  Does it?  And that's why they're going to play it now.  Maybe that Aussie dude shredded it up and was hilarious.  Jason Ellis debuts on Opie and Anthony via ISDN from Los Angeles.  Australian comedian Jim Jeffries is in studio as O and A are getting to know him and promote  his show coming to the virus.  Jim is put off by Jason's personality.  Oh, really?  Yes.  That's what's about to happen.  Right.  Well, I'll fight that guy.  I'll arrange that.  Is he undefeated in an amateur boxing and professional mixed martial arts ring? 
[01:14:30]  Isn't he the guy that got beat up?  You did get beat up.  He's a bitch.  He cowered like a bitch too.  He would be O and one in amateur boxing.  Went down into the fetal position.  Fetal.  Don't even come at me.  Like a baby.  If you go fetal on a motherfucker, don't be coming to me with anything.  Shut the fuck up and go home.  Fetal.  I don't go into the fetal for a fucking, like an elephant.  I'd at least fucking give it a kick.  You know what I mean?  You went fetal on a fucking drunk fan. 
[01:15:00]  Ridiculous, Michael.  Ridiculous.  Absolutely absurd.  Why am I even on here right now explaining, nobody should play this.  Jim Jefferies is a fucking tool bag.  He's a baby.  He's an infant.  He's a diaper wearing comedian.  What a fucking baby.  Somebody fucking burp this little bitch.  Jim Jefferies.  Is he rich yet?  I doubt it.  Right.  Good.  Is this it?  Yes. 
[01:15:30]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Where's Jason Ellis?  He doesn't talk about Johnny K plus 8 on his radio show, does he?  Hey, Jason.  I've never heard of the bitch.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Never heard of the bitch.  How's it going?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  We got in studio Jim Jefferies, who's from Australia.  Hello, mate.  How are you?  Oh, God.  I feel like I'm talking to my mom right now.  What the fuck's going on here?  I mean, you moved out of Australia when you were 14 years old.  You have a thicker accent than me, you bastard. 
[01:16:00]  I left when I was 17, and I'm talking to you like me and you, but then I'll go back  to Opie and Anthony so that the world can understand me.  Yeah, it is bizarre.  It's like...  We just said things then to each other that you wouldn't even know.  There were subplots.  There was...  I know.  I feel like...  I asked him on a date, and he said, go fuck yourself.  It's a secret language.  I feel like I got Jim Jefferies' clone on the phone.  We just think it's an accent, but it is a secret language.  Yeah.  I feel like there's an echo going on. 
[01:16:30]  Chigs dig it, though, man.  His voice.  They do dig it.  It's ridiculous how much they want to bone you.  You know what else?  Oh, go ahead.  I heard you talking about kangaroos, and I realized that you can just say anything you  want if you're Australian and American, and everybody believes it.  Oh, they don't even exist.  Oh, you're a dinosaur kangaroos.  I feel like a kangaroos.  It's true.  They're fucking 20 feet high.  There was dinosaur kangaroos.  Oh, no.  Yeah, my mom's got one in her backyard.  We do.  We just eat that shit up.  Really?  He said it with that accent. 
[01:17:00]  It's got to be true.  I am partial to life.  Did you know that ACDC's lyrics came from a dinosaur kangaroo?  It was red and giant.  Sure, they have one.  They still have one.  12 feet tall.  Yeah.  Yeah, we just believe it because it sounds Australian.  Oh, come on.  I've told a story about drop bears where they were like feral koala bears, and they would  drop out of trees on your face and mole people.  My dad used to say the drop bears.  That was a myth to her parents.  If you weren't strong enough, they could actually kill you.  If you couldn't get them off your face in time, they might slash your jugular or something.  And that story came back to me drunk at a bar like 10 years later. 
[01:17:30]  Do you know about drop bears?  No, my dad told us about drop bears.  What the fuck are you talking about, you idiot?  I made it up.  That's a standard thing, drop bears.  Really?  My father would tell us about drop bears so we'd look up at trees and shit.  They sound like cute fuzzy headcrabs from Half-Life.  No, they just...  You know, they're actually really terrifying.  I think, yeah.  Your wife had another kid, right?  Yeah, humongous baby out of her vagina.  The doctor had to cut her vagina in front of me.  I watched the scissors go into the beave and cut it open. 
[01:18:00]  Fucking...  I don't want to bang her.  She's not listening right now.  It was a drop baby.  It dropped out on his head and started mauling the doctor.  I always find that funny...  You know what?  He came out the same size as the fucking koala.  He's a beast.  He came out humongous.  When my brother had his kid, his wife had the baby.  Same thing.  They cut the cunt open.  The baby falls out, right?  You know Australians are the only people that can say cunt correctly.  Cunt.  Oh, yeah, cunt.  It's not offensive if we say...  When you say it, it's like, whoa, dude, is it really impossible?  We say the chicks fucking punch us and leave the house immediately. 
[01:18:30]  You guys saying it's like, it's so endearing.  Fuck me.  But they cut the baby out and they go, you're not to have sex with her for six weeks.  And he's like, well, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because I was so desperate to fuck that.  He said at the end it looked like Apollo Creed's face when he was killed in Rocky IV.  Oh, wow.  Thanks a lot for putting that in there.  That's cool.  Jason, so your first child, they didn't have to do it, but his name's Tiger, right? 
[01:19:00]  Your son's name is Tiger for Tiger?  Tiger Lee Ellis.  Recognized.  Nice.  And you had to watch this go down.  Not named after that fucking retarded golf player.  I can assure you of that.  Get a real sport, bitch.  That's got to be pretty fucked up to see that live.  My father-in-law was like, hey, man, guess what?  Tiger came back to play golf after hurting himself the same day Tiger was born.  I'm like, what the fuck would you tell me that for?  Fuck golf.  Fuck that guy.  Useless.  When he injured himself playing golf, fuck off.  Injured himself smoking a fucking pole, you useless prick. 
[01:19:30]  My God.  Golf injury.  Jesus.  Good point.  Good point.  I shattered my wrist and had pins in it, and my doctor's like, do you know how many golf  players I have in here?  And I was like, no.  I don't have any.  And I was like, what the fuck does that mean?  He's like, figure it out.  I'm like, oh, fuck you.  Fuck doctors.  Fuck golf.  Fuck all you mother pussies.  Break something and fucking live your life, you homo.  And then you decide, you're in your, what, mid-30s?  Because I think you're talking about it here.  37.  37. 
[01:20:00]  You decided to pick up some MMA crap recently, right?  Yeah.  You had your first fight?  Yeah, my first pro fight, like, was it a month ago?  Yeah.  Yeah, just under a month.  I won.  I'm undefeated.  Yeah, you knocked the dude out in the first round, right?  No, that was my, I had an amateur boxing fight about three months ago, and I knocked  that dude out in 90 seconds, and then this is an MMA fight, which is,  uh, mixed martial arts.  I heard you guys talking about it.  It's always been called mixed martial arts.  UFC just made it look like Ultimate Fighter, because they're the big organization of America. 
[01:20:30]  Hey, uh, you've got a lot of your fans calling right now.  The LL Cool J interview, this is one I have no idea about.  Yeah.  So I don't know what I'm getting into, but they said, you gotta mention LL Cool J to  Jason Ellis.  Yeah, he, he, uh, was on the show, like, he was in New York, and I was here, and somebody  said, hey man, LL's gonna be on your show in five minutes.  I was like, you mean LL Cool J, the rapper dude?  And they were like, yeah.  And I was like, okay, that's weird.  And then my boss said to me, right before I went in the studio, I'm sure you guys have 
[01:21:00]  dealt with this, that's the thing I wanted to talk to you about, but we'll get into it  later, uh, my boss says, just so you know, Will is, I'm sorry, LL Cool J is, uh, good  friends with, uh, the big boss at Sirius, and when he's done with your show, he's gonna  walk into that, uh, office and talk to that guy.  And I'm like, what does that mean?  I'm not saying it means anything.  I'm just saying, that's what he's going to be doing after the interview, and I was like,  that's weird, because I don't really, you know what I mean, I'll fuck with people, but 
[01:21:30]  usually if it's a celebrity, I know what you got, you know, they need to be pampered.  Oh, you're so fucking glorious, fuck you, when's your album coming out?  You know, I know that, I know that bullshit, so I've never really said anything too bad,  but straight off the bat, this dude starts coming at me, because he misunderstood me.  I said he was like the prince of hip hop.  Yeah.  Because, because he was getting a, his last record was on a certain record label.  I could care less, man.  I never thought he was good anyway.  But he, he, he's, you know, I said something about you, uh, you're like the prince of hip hop, 
[01:22:00]  except you don't have arseless pants.  And he thought I, that he, I was saying that he had arseless pants.  No dog, no dog, you are.  You, you're the one in the garage with your arseless pants, motherfucker.  I'm like, what?  What's going, you get these balls, and I was like, get, get, get your balls?  You're pissed at me, you want me to get your balls?  Like, what's up with that?  So now, I, I gather he went to the boss, uh, after this great conversation.  I haven't been fired.  Well, yeah, I mean, you know.  I'm still here. 
[01:22:30]  If he's listening, I'm still here, and nobody's listening to your album, you steaming pile of shit.  Why don't you do another episode of Project Runway, you washed up motherfucker.  He's got a little of everything.  You're, he's, he was in Mall Cop, you got your own band.  Taint, yeah.  Taint Stick.  Taint Stick.  Taint Stick.  Taint, recognize.  Yeah.  Recognize the Taint Stick.  Yeah.  The show today is actually groundbreaking.  Uh, a new song, I'm actually not, yeah, fuck it, I'll tell it. 
[01:23:00]  A new song that no one's ever heard, uh, ever before is going to debut on the Jason  Nell show today, and it's all about my truck that I have, which is very riveting, I'm sure  you can imagine.  A song about a truck.  Is it a country, country song?  No, no, it's a, we're sort of a metal comedy band, but we're very serious, and, you know,  I mean, the only thing that, that stops me from being really committed  to it is, as I said before, I dropped a bunch of loads in my wife's carnival, and there's  no fucking coming back.  Yeah, yeah, that baby. 
[01:23:30]  Because now that, the radio show is getting better, and I get a lot of girls like, hey,  hey, I'm like, cool, I have two kids.  You probably want to blow me?  Awesome.  That, yeah, that works out fucking sweet now, doesn't it?  Motherfucker!  I got nothing!  I wake up fucking seven times a night, fucking bitches want to blow me now?  Oh, shit!  I hate it, man.  Everyone at MySpace, hey, hey, hey!  I won't even click on it anymore.  I have direct ones where they say, they say, hey, hey, hey, I'm like, wow, that's actually 
[01:24:00]  you, that's what you're saying.  So, I can fuck you.  I can do you.  I can do all of you.  And your friends.  Hey, I heard you talking about threesomes.  I've got a friend who'll fuck you.  Great!  Cool.  I'm just going to go burp a baby.  And then I'll be right back.  Fuck, I'm going to go watch a human come out and rip my wife's uterus in half.  And know that that's the only uterus that I'll be touching ever again.  And you and your friends all want to blow me?  Sweet!  Can't wait to fucking go home.  You've got the worst timing.  You should have started this radio thing in your early 20s. 
[01:24:30]  I know, but I didn't know I was that funny.  Yeah, you're pretty funny.  You're very funny, actually.  What else are you doing on the show today, Jason?  Record deals and talking about a baby coming out of my wife's vagina and debuting a new song.  Oh, wait.  Is this your first live show since having the kid?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm back.  I'll be checking it out today, then.  Cool.  Yeah, I'm going to talk about you guys and how we're now like the Wonder Twins, except we're not gay. 
[01:25:00]  What's a good one?  We're like Birdman.  You're Birdman.  And I'm that fucking eagle.  And when the sun's out, we're going to fucking fly out of a cave and fuck everybody up.  It's going to be awesome.  It could be like that.  I'm going to start learning how to sound like an eagle.  And make sure you trash Jim Jefferies on your show today, too.  Fuck Jim Jefferies.  Guys are steaming pilots.  Who is Jim Jefferies anyway?  What the fuck?  It's me and ACDC.  Fuck everybody else.  That's the only Australians allowed. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, Jefferies is taping his HBO special Saturday night.  First Australian ever to do one.  Yeah, we're tired.  A funny guy from Australia.  Wow.  He must really bone a lot of whores.  He's fucking hilarious.  Wow, that is a weird...  You got herpes?  No, actually no.  I was working on it.  Every now and again I think I've got them and the doctor just says it's like a rash.  Speaking of herpes, Bret Michaels admitted to you that he has herpes?  One and two, motherfuckers.  He said one.  I said herpes.  He said one and two.  He goes one and two.  Is that two grades of herpes? 
[01:26:00]  No, it means mouth and pee-pee.  Oh, I got the mouth.  Every time he watches that show and he makes out with those chicks.  Like, what did the other...  Holy shit.  I can't watch that.  Yeah, now the show becomes really entertaining because he does it to everybody with his 50-year-old...  He's a nasty-ass motherfucker.  I actually like the guy but he's the most grotesque individual ever and he'll like...  He has that weird...  You know, because he puckers up so he looks good in the photo.  He looks like a girl from the 80s.  You know, that whole thing he does?  Yeah.  He does that when he makes out with them so he's like... 
[01:26:30]  And just drops herpes all over everybody.  Oh, fuck.  There's no remorse.  He made out with like a 22-year-old the other day.  He's like...  Welcome to herpes.  Like, all over his face.  Fucks her life up and anyone she fucks.  Welcome to herpes.  He gave her herpes all over her face and then fucking booted her off the show.  Like, thanks a lot.  Then he's a little token of...  You know what?  You can only give them if you've got them at this stage.  You can still fuck a chip when you do that.  You know what?  Fuck.  That's a complete lie.  That's a complete lie.  Because I also do sex stuff on my show about...  Because like I said, I care. 
[01:27:00]  I care.  I care.  But herpes, when you're not showing with a condom on, you can still get herpes.  Terrify yourself on that.  And did you know that where you are, 25% of you have herpes?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, just about everyone.  Don't fuck anybody in New York, dude.  Come back over here.  Most people have herpes.  Oh, right.  I'd rather say...  No, New York has more herpes than anyone in America.  I'd rather say 75% don't.  There you go.  I'm more the herpes.  Those are three-quarter empty.  Right.  All right. 
[01:27:30]  Hey, we've got to let you go, man.  Jason, it was a pleasure.  Hey, thanks for letting me on there, man.  Cool, Jason.  I appreciate it.  Remember, non-boner dick tattoos on our asses.  Right.  When I come to New York, let's do it.  Let's do it in a church.  No shit.  It's a joke.  That's a joke.  Team virus.  Team virus.  Team virus.  Yeah, way to hurt us.  Thanks.  Way to remind us of that nightmare.  All right.  You'll be all right.  Hey, we'll talk to you soon.  All right, Jason?  All right, man.  All right.  Later, boss.  Peace.  Jason Ellis, everyone.  He's the real deal.  I really enjoy his show. 
[01:28:00]  That was exhausting, though.  Now I need a nap.  I know.  Guy could talk.  That's how we used to be at AAF.  What?  All hyper stuff?  Just ARA!  Before we got better?  See what you got to look forward to, Jason?  Bitterness.  Bitterness.  He was asking.  He's getting kicked around.  Right.  It's all fun.  Everything's new to him all.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Wait till the bosses beat you down for a decade.  They fucking physically browbeaten. 
[01:28:30]  Right.  Ass raped.  Wait till your first contract negotiation.  You got so many firsts in your career.  Wait till they take every great bit you came up with and tell you why you can't do it anymore.  They just pick.  You know what it is?  Sit there and let them pick your soul away.  Your very soul.  Right.  Until there's nothing left of what was you.  Oh, yeah.  And then there.  You've made it.  There's going to be no more pink punching you in the face.  Yeah.  Because that's not cool. 
[01:29:00]  Especially you punching her.  That ain't happening.  Yeah.  In another year.  LL Cool J trashing him.  No.  Never going to happen.  That won't happen.  Because he's going to be involved with something that matters.  That you can't talk about because it's that.  Right.  And this.  It's refreshing to hear somebody with that much energy.  Yeah.  In the business and that much faith and just thinking that naive thinking that it's all  going to go great.  Right.  And stuff.  Believe me.  He sounds very good.  I bet he'll be very successful.  But by the time you get everything you want, you're an empty shell of a man. 
[01:29:30]  And that's why he sounds like we used to.  Yes.  How is he used to it?  He's done, man.  Oh, thank fuck for that.  Bloody hell.  I have never heard of it.  I was homesick about 50 minutes ago.  I was homesick.  And now I don't want to visit the country ever again.  What's wrong, Jim?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  We're going to punch someone in the fucking hand of the thing. 
[01:30:00]  And my wife's fucking snatch has just been coming.  And a baby fell out in the fucking thing.  That's what he does.  Oh, my God.  And you're a fan opening.  He is shit.  That guy is fucking shit.  He didn't say one fucking funny thing.  He didn't let anyone fucking get in.  He just mouthed off about everything.  And you're a fan.  You Aussies cannot get along.  That's why you're not a superpower.  Holy fucking shit.  That's why you're not a superpower.  I just went into the office and said, I'm not going to say, I've got to walk away. 
[01:30:30]  This guy is fucking true.  You should have said it to his face.  He was, I couldn't get a word in.  Try to say it to his face.  He would have told me that he punched some guy in the karate he's in a fucking known form of martial arts.  We were just talking about, though, this is how you are at the beginning of your radio career.  If you listen to early tapes of us, I think you've been in those shows.  We're full of piss and vinegar.  It's like, yeah, we're in radio, man.  And then as time goes by and your bosses and the business suck the fucking life force out of you, 
[01:31:00]  then you end up like this, where you're just like, yeah, just fuck everything.  Fuck everyone.  I'm halfway through a crossword.  That's how fucking much.  I've never done a crossword, and I'm not even good at them.  Yeah, I saw that you changed halfway through that.  I just went, oh, fuck this.  I'm not.  Fuck, fuck this.  I love that.  Fuck this.  I like Jason Ellis. 
[01:31:30]  I like his radio show.  That's funny.  I'm sure he's radio show fine, but oh my God.  I'm sure I love his radio show.  I haven't heard so many fuckers.  I'm a swearer.  I love a good swearer.  Don't get me wrong.  He was selling himself to a whole new audience.  You know what?  There you go.  And I think that's what one of the callers was going to get to, but fuck it.  I'm going to just comment on this.  When he's at the point where he's playing old tapes of himself and Juice chilling out,  perhaps will be in that montage.  He's just so full of vim and vigor and energy, and that goes away. 
[01:32:00]  And it just, it just, I hope, I can only hope the bosses shit on you enough that you  can have a career just like we've had.  Success?  Sure.  That part of it, that part of it's fun.  It's exciting.  You get to, you get to get things you want.  You know, it was very nice when I paid my credit cards off and I would look at something  in the store and go, I could just buy that.  But then you realize, they've taken my very soul from me. 
[01:32:30]  The bosses have taken my soul.  Oh, I enjoy my fucking, my life.  I enjoy my car.  I enjoy everything.  But there's part of me that I listen to in my early tapes that's dead!  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, E-Rock and Sam, as usual.  And joining us is Intern David, because you went to Comic-Con. 
[01:33:00]  Well, I went to Comic-Con with Intern David, and we met up with you.  It was a whole ordeal, and it was hilarious.  So stay tuned and listen to it with us on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Me and my buddy Intern David went to the New York Comic-Con last year at the Jacob Javits Center.  And we were basically going around interviewing people, and I had David insult people's costumes.  Yes.  Uh, I then left David, or is this a two-part?  No, this is part one.  And I basically had David insult people's costumes. 
[01:33:30]  Yes.  And he did a good job of it.  I mean, just, somebody like David, like just the, the, the picture-perfect nerd going around  and telling people that they're not cool is, to me, one of the funniest things you could  do.  And that's what you did.  True.  With David, Sam, at New York Comic-Con, here on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  I actually felt retarded.  Like, really retarded.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sam, you brought Intern David to Comic-Con. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, we got to spend Saturday afternoon together at the New York Comic-Con.  Aw, that's sweet.  How did that go?  It was great.  It was me and David and my girlfriend, and she was psyched not only to go to Comic-Con,  but to get to spend the afternoon with David.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  How much does she hate you?  No, she had fun.  And what we did was, David noticed that everybody was coming in, in costumes and stuff.  He thought there would be more celebrities there.  Yeah.  I would, uh, be very angry if I went to a Comic-Con and there weren't a lot of celebrities.  But there never really are that many. 
[01:34:30]  At the New York Comic-Con, there's a bunch of artists and stuff, but there aren't really,  I mean, I met the Honky Tonk Man.  No way.  The Honky Tonk Man was there?  Yes, yes.  I remember the Honky Tonk Man.  Wow, the Honky Tonk Man.  He kind of did the Elvis thing before he wrestled.  But other than that, I mean, there wasn't...  No, like, um, people from the original cast of Lost in Space or anything like that?  Like Penny?  No, there was...  Lou Ferrigno's always there.  Lou Ferrigno?  Okay, now you're talking celebrities, though.  This is what...  Was he the biggest... 
[01:35:00]  This is the meat and potatoes of it.  Was he the biggest celebrity there?  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, there was nobody really worth waiting online for, except Honky Tonk Man.  Yeah.  What do you do with Lou Ferrigno?  You know, Jell-O shots out of his ears?  His line is really long, but it's just people going, Lou, Lou, Lou, could you sign this?  Lou.  So, and she just walk around like the Verizon man.  Poor Lou.  Lou!  Aw.  All right, we're going to do a two-parter.  The big story about that... 
[01:35:30]  What's that song again?  Great American...  Greatest American Hero.  Greatest American Hero, yeah.  Ah, yes.  That'll be after the break, but first...  So, what we did was, instead, I had him talk to...  Because he made an observation that so many people come to these conventions in costumes.  Right.  Now, what type of costumes?  It's of their favorite heroes and characters.  From comic books and TV shows and things like that?  And the like.  Yeah, geek culture.  Yes.  Nice.  And I had David kind of interview them and make observations about their costumes. 
[01:36:00]  Okay.  Just because, you know, it'd be good, because David's just your typical average Joe.  Oh, he certainly is.  You know?  Well, not average Joe.  Do you like that, David?  Yes.  David, you do.  A little chuckle.  As you can see, David was very proud of his press pass that he's still wearing today.  Yes.  You're still wearing that thing, huh?  It's the lamest press pass ever, though.  Yep.  Yeah, it's just got his name on it.  No.  That's like one step above just a yellow star of David on your shirt. 
[01:36:30]  No, no, no.  It's not even my correct name.  It's spelled, my name is spelled incorrectly on the press badge.  Is it?  Yes.  Whose fault is that?  I don't know.  Someone, whoever gave in the names.  Steve.  Ah, yes.  All right.  Let's start with the intern David talks to the Joker and writes his impression.  Well, that's the Joker.  Some dude is just dressed as the Joker.  Everybody, the new thing at these comic cons is that everybody has to come as Heath Ledger,  as the Joker, the Heath Ledger Joker.  Oh, no.  I mean, all those coffins coming through. 
[01:37:00]  They're like hundreds of them all dressed up as the new Joker.  Really?  Yeah.  The best part, I bet you every single person thought they were going to be the only one.  Yeah, they thought they had the cool, like, nobody else is going to spray their hair green.  Right.  Like, no one's going to be dressed as Sully this holiday.  Yeah.  We've got a good idea.  Then you go to the party, there's five other Sully's.  Just five guys with cheesy mustaches and damn apples.  Yeah.  Just, of course, that's going to be, like, one of the more popular ones.  All right.  Here we go. 
[01:37:30]  Let's start with this.  Hello.  This is intern David at the Comic-Con Festival at the Jacob Javin Center, and we're here with  the Joker today.  How are you today, Joker?  I'm just fine.  You know, trying to cause a little anarchy here, here and there.  What qualifies you as the best Joker amongst all the Jokers in this convention today?  That's an interesting question.  Probably because I can do the voice.  No, you can't.  I do.  Oh, God.  I just got such douche chills.  Is that the guy? 
[01:38:00]  Yes.  That's an awful...  Are these pictures up on a way?  That's awful makeup.  He should call himself the Jacker, because that's what he is.  It's horrid.  Dude, he doesn't do the voice.  Anarchy.  Anarchy.  And his makeup is awful.  It really is bad.  Well, David gave him a fair assessment.  Since David was face-to-face, you know, six inches away from him, he decided to give  the fair assessment of the impression.  All right.  The voice.  Nobody else can.  Can you do the voice?  I'll do it for you right now. 
[01:38:30]  You see, to them, Muggsy, I'm just a freak, and they're all normal.  You see, that's about it.  That's all I got for you.  That's the best you can do.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  You rule.  He just started laughing and saying, that's terrible.  That's terrible.  David.  Nice.  Called him out.  Right to his face, David.  Yep.  I like that.  See, because all these guys in costumes, like, every, like, internet blog and every 
[01:39:00]  place goes and interviews people at Comic-Con, and they all have cute stories on, like, everybody  who's in costume gets interviewed for these puff pieces, so they're all like, yeah, I'm  the Joker, blah, blah, blah.  And then David comes along and says, no, you're kind of, it's terrible.  You're terrible.  You think it was a good impression?  No, it wasn't good at all.  It was horrible.  And the guy just slumped away, all dejected.  Well, no, he thought he could survive.  He thought he was just part of the joke, so then David decided to tell him what he thought 
[01:39:30]  of his costume.  Oh, my God.  That's probably better.  What about your costume?  What about my costume?  You think your costume was better than all the other Jokers?  Yes, I do.  I don't think so.  Your costume's not looking too good.  Why?  Why?  What do you think of the costume?  His costume was terrible.  I could have done a better job on that costume.  All right.  Wrap it up.  All right.  Thank you so much, Joker.  He got mad.  He had to skulk away.  Wait, he said wrap it up?  No, I told him, because the kid, at that point, he's just kind of standing there, giving  us the, all right, just like moving around. 
[01:40:00]  David doesn't know when to wrap it up, so.  That's true.  Well, you know what?  You should let him go, I don't know.  Well, we got, there's more.  All right.  David talks to Scooby-Doo?  Yes, David found Scooby-Doo, and Scooby-Doo sits and takes it while David insults him for  a minute.  Well, Scooby-Doo happened to be a six-foot-four black man with glasses and a Scooby-Doo outfit.  Oh, boy.  He was wearing a Scooby-Doo, like, what, like, almost like a mascot-type outfit? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, and it was one of those masks where, like, the Scooby-Doo head sits on top of his  head so you can see his face through where the neck is.  Oh, those are the dumbest masks ever.  Yeah, this guy was.  He's not six-four, by the way.  The black guy is as tall as you, Sam, but then the head on top of his head makes him  six-four.  He's some big nerdy black guy with glasses and a Scooby-Doo costume.  Look at him.  He's.  He looks like Chris Rock.  This is coming out of Scooby-Doo's neck.  That's not Scooby-Doo.  Horrible.  I hate those costumes where the head is on top of the guy's head. 
[01:41:00]  It was also a one-piece costume that was too small.  Like, his torso was too long, so there was just a huge bulge.  Like, he came up.  He had a male.  David refused to mention it, but he had a...  Oh, he should have.  How do you say costume?  Costume?  Costume.  What's wrong with that?  It's probably the right way to say it, but...  Costume.  Most people alive say costume.  No, costume.  Costume.  Do you say...  Costume.  Do you say schedule, too?  Schedule.  Schedule.  Costume.  Costume.  Costume. 
[01:41:30]  Costume.  What do you say to it?  Costume.  Costume.  Because with the T and the U, costume.  Put your costume on.  It's terrible.  Costume.  I think it might be the proper way to say it, but it just doesn't sound right.  All right, here's Intern David just talking about Scooby-Doo.  Hello, this is Intern David.  We're here at the 2009 Comic-Con Festival, and who do we have with us today?  Ruby-Dooby-Doo!  Oh, wow.  It's Ruby-Dooby-Doo.  Oof.  Oh, my God. 
[01:42:00]  Yep.  Why is it Ruby-Dooby-Doo?  He's a dog, so, you know...  Ruby-Doo.  Why Ruby?  Yeah.  They ever do Ruby and Scooby-Doo?  They do kind of, you know, when he said it was a little weird, but he didn't say Ruby.  They definitely did.  And who do we have with us today?  Ruby-Dooby-Doo!  He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he.  You don't look so much like Scooby-Doo to me.  I mean, what's that weird voice that you got going on there?  It's kind of weird.  Is that how you normally talk? 
[01:42:30]  Well, no, this is how I normally talk.  Hey, ladies.  But when I come to Comic-Con, I'm Scooby-Dooby-Doo!  He-he-he-he-he.  Why do you keep laughing like that, like with a little nerdy giggle?  What's that all about?  Well, let's say I've had some Scooby snacks earlier, if you know what I mean.  No, I don't know what you mean.  That doesn't sound anything like Scooby-Doo.  What?  You've never seen my cartoon.  What cartoon do you have?  Scooby-Doo.  Scooby-Doo, where are you?  Scooby-Doo-Boo-Doo.  Do you nerdy-looking guys in glasses have cartoons? 
[01:43:00]  Well, not me personally.  The cartoon I'm wearing.  I've never seen a nerdy Scooby-Doo before.  No, you have.  That's what you see in Comic-Con.  The balls on this kid.  Then again, you're dealing with just nerds.  Yeah, you act like he's calling out Chuck Liddell.  He's calling out a black-retarded guy in a Scooby outfit.  A Ruby-Doo.  Ruby-Doo.  They all just walk around with their costumes and they play the part.  Yes, they do.  Yes, all of them.  This is an embarrassment.  Right, David?  Oy!  Oy, oy, oy.  They're going to torch the building when all these people are in there. 
[01:43:30]  Are you embarrassed for them?  I am so embarrassed for this guy.  What part got you?  The part where the Ruby-Doo was bad, but then when he tried to just talk off the cuff, off script, in the voice, he just can't do it.  The Scooby snack line was pretty funny.  Oh, was that hysterical?  My favorite was when he goes, if you know what I mean.  And then David goes, no, I have no idea what you mean.  David's very energetic.  Unbelievable.  All right, then you guys moved on to Mario. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, Super Mario was there.  No way.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Track is there, right?  Hold on a minute.  Intern David at Comic-Con.  Hello, this is Intern David at the Comic-Con convention at the Jacob Javits Center, and we're here with Mario.  How are you today, Mario?  Very good.  What kind of a costume are you wearing right now?  I'm wearing overalls, boots, gloves, Mario hat with the M on it, mustache, and the shirt, the red shirt.  Wait, what did you just say? 
[01:44:30]  What's that thing on your upper lip that I see?  It's a mustache.  You think that's a real mustache?  Yeah, it's a real mustache.  What's so real about it?  It looks kind of fake to me, don't you think?  Okay, yeah, it's fake.  That's what I thought.  It is fake.  It's just...  He's a journalist.  He's getting to the bottom of things.  He wants Mario to finally admit that is a fake mustache.  It's not a real Mario.  It's five inches wide and a foot long on his face.  It's made of felt. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, made of felt, was it?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  What about the rest of your outfit?  Do you think that's a really good Mario costume?  It's all right.  It fits.  It's better than everybody else's.  What makes it better?  I've seen some other Marios hopping and jumping around here.  I think there's a better.  Well, what do you want me to do about it?  Maybe you should go make a better Mario costume.  I mean, you have an M stitched onto your hat like that.  You didn't get a real hat with a real M on.  You have to stitch your own M on your hat?  Well, it's better than your costume. 
[01:45:30]  You don't have anything on.  I'm not trying to be anyone.  I'm just trying to be a regular, ordinary person from a radio station reporting.  That's all.  All right.  I'm done.  Thanks so much, Mario.  Thanks so much, Mario.  They back down pretty easily, don't they?  Yes, they do.  Yeah.  They just get all depressed.  You won't find one set of balls on any of these guys, huh?  It's their big day at Comic-Con.  Right.  David's just blowing up their swamp.  And they get all excited because they think it's going to be like a little puff piece where 
[01:46:00]  they get to stay in character and be like, we're here with Mario.  And David just smashes them.  We got one more there, Sam.  This is my favorite moment of the entire weekend, maybe of the year so far.  Yeah.  David talking to Dick Tracy.  This is intern David live at the 2009 Comic-Con Festival.  And who do we have with us today?  I'm Detective Dick Tracy.  You are?  What's this costume that you have on here?  This costume is a vest, this yellow, beautiful coat, and my snapping fedora. 
[01:46:30]  Wait, so you're telling me you're dressed up as Dick Tracy.  Is that correct?  Yes.  You look nothing like Dick Tracy.  What are you talking about?  Hey, I got the Tomy gun, pal.  Don't mess with me.  What's with that gun?  You made that out of cardboard and wood.  That's a big gun.  How could that hurt me?  Oh, um, it doesn't shoot, but, uh, this is real.  Get my trip?  No, I have no clue.  So what's up? 
[01:47:00]  I'm still trying to figure out your costume.  You don't look everything like Dick Tracy to me.  I think Dick Tracy was a lot skinnier than that.  Oh!  He just turns around.  And then that guy just, I've never seen someone so quickly just turn around.  He said, goodbye, and just turned around.  He is a fat Dick Tracy.  I said, oh, you don't look so, you don't look so, you look fat.  You're not a skinny Dick Tracy.  And he walked away like, goodbye.  Yeah, we laughed over.  Listen to the last second.  I think he said something like, I'm done.  Yeah, listen.  So what's up?  I'm still, I'm still trying to figure out your costume. 
[01:47:30]  You don't look anything like Dick Tracy to me.  I think Dick Tracy was a lot skinnier than that.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye, and he walked away, and he ran away.  He was so upset.  David, we might have created a monster because he had so much fun once he started making fun  of people that even when we were done, he just started walking by people going, what  are you supposed to be?  Not on tape.  He walks by this Dick Tracy guy again, who was obviously furious, who had his back to  David while the kid was on the phone.  And David pats him on the back and just says, thanks for the interview, Dick. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, God.  He's going to be on 42nd Street.  Hey, who are all you black guys in red hats and red scarves?  Oh, right on.  Did they think you were dressed as Joby Joby Doo?  You know what?  The funny thing about the Scooby Doo guy was that he was passing around these cards for  his website.  He has some website called www.nerdyblackguy.com or something.  He was supposed to say, yeah.  What?  All right, listen. 
[01:48:30]  We've got to take a break.  Part two with intern David.  Now, you left Comic-Con, but he stayed there?  Yeah, that's the thing.  I had to go.  I had to get a train home, so I left.  But E-Rock was there.  Yeah.  And so he met us there, and he was like, well, I'm going to stick around for a while.  David, if you don't want to go home, we'll just walk around together.  And then David filled me in on what I missed.  It's a good story.  Yes, it is.  Look at David.  Yes, it is.  Yeah, we'll get into that after the break. 
[01:49:00]  Intern David, you stay on the couch there.  Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Worst of Opie and Anthony continuing with intern David and primetime Sam Roberts at New York Comic-Con.  And now somehow I fold into the story.  Well, like I said, I brought David with me to Comic-Con to help him, you know, because I was going to cover it.  And I figured I'll bring David to be my little assistant and get some gold out of him.  I had to leave because I have a life.  And you were there.  You came a little later and we met up with you there.  And so I left intern David with you. 
[01:49:30]  And first thing Monday morning, he comes back to me and tells me all the fabulous E-Rock stories about you wanting to meet all your people and acting a fool.  It was just great.  No, it wasn't acting a fool.  It was meeting two people that he had no idea who they were.  Well, they were pretty...  They were the cast of Greatest American Hero.  It sucks.  No, it's awesome.  It sucks.  It's awesome.  Robert Culp.  Yeah, nobody knows who that is.  Well, you will after this bit on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Who the fuck is listening? 
[01:50:00]  To the worst.  Who's fucking listening?  To the worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Part two of intern David.  Executive.  The executive intern.  Yes.  At Comic-Con with Sam.  Yes.  So Sam left to catch a train.  And David stayed behind.  And E-Rock showed up, right?  Yeah, well, David...  Well, E-Rock was already there, yeah.  E-Rock met me and Sam and Sam's girlfriend.  And Sam and his girlfriend had to go home.  They were busy, so they couldn't stay anymore.  And me and E-Rock stayed and observed all the different toys and what was going on there. 
[01:50:30]  And I hear you have a good E-Rock story.  And we love a good E-Rock story on this show.  Who doesn't?  I know you do.  Yeah, what do you got on E-Rock?  Well, we walked around.  We saw all the toys and stuff.  And then we proceeded to move on to another area where there were people signing autographs.  Ah, these are where the big celebrities are.  The big gets.  Yeah.  You see any big celebrities there, Intern David?  Well, we saw some big celebrities.  Yeah.  I mean, but to me, they weren't that big.  But to E-Rock, they were really, really huge. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, E-Rock is a nerd.  He's the biggest nerd among us.  That's for sure.  Yep.  All right, continue, David.  Biggest anything among us.  Okay, well, two individuals were there.  William Catt and Robert Culp were there from The Greatest American Hero.  Wait, wait, wait.  Robert Culp was also there?  Yes, Robert Culp was there, yes.  Wow.  Is that a wow moment?  That, to get both of them together, is like pretty much reuniting the Beatles. 
[01:51:30]  Uh, I'm amazed that I wasn't told this before.  Ugh.  Hairs.  If they were on fire, I wouldn't go by their booth.  Like reuniting two Dung Beatles.  Well, we keep playing this song, Greatest American Hero, David.  Yes.  Because of what you saw at Comic-Con this past weekend.  Yes.  What did you see?  We saw William Catt and Robert Culp from Greatest American Hero. 
[01:52:00]  Okay.  Now, E-Rock saw them and got super, super excited because he claims that William Catt was his childhood hero  and that this was his favorite show of all time and he used to watch this show every single day  and he loved this show so much and he was so excited.  Now, how did you know he was really excited?  What did he do?  He said, oh, look, there's William Catt.  Oh, look, William Catt from Greatest American Hero.  Oh, my God, this is my favorite guy from all time.  I love this guy.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, E-Rock. 
[01:52:30]  And then I proceeded to say, I have no idea who this guy is because I didn't know who the  heck William Catt was.  I had no clue.  You never saw the show, huh?  No, because I found out later that when this show aired, I was one and two years old when  the show aired, so I had no idea about it.  Not even E-Rock's old at this point.  Yes.  I had no idea about it, yeah.  Yeah, but E-Rock, very excited, huh?  Very excited.  Well, he probably saw the Greatest American Hero sign and thought it was a big sandwich  that was there. 
[01:53:00]  Well, he thought it said zero and it was his name.  And, uh, he had to take a seat.  So, so before we were walking up, there was a little bit of a line, so, like, other people  were getting his autograph, so E-Rock proceeded to tell me a story about how he has a certain,  about how he has a little mark underneath his eye, a gash.  We've all seen the little scar gassing under E-Rock's eye.  Yes, I didn't know about it.  The little scar or something.  Yeah, I don't know if everyone knows.  I'll explain it real quick.  According to E-Rock, he was one day watching the Greatest American Hero at his home and  proceeded to pretend to be the Greatest American Hero and proceeded to, like, fly down his, 
[01:53:30]  fly down his, uh, the room in his house.  So he flew down his house and went into his parents' bedroom and flew right into his parents'  nightstand and hit right into, right below his eye and got a huge gash.  Well, he was fake flying.  He was fake flying, yeah.  He was fake flying, he was moving his hands out and running, pretending to fly, yes.  And he flew into his mother's bedroom right into the nightstand and got a big gash underneath  his eye.  All because he loves the show.  Loves the show, wanting to pretend that he was the Greatest American Hero and pretend  he was William Catt.  Yes. 
[01:54:00]  What was this show even about?  He's the Greatest American Hero, Jimmy.  Come on.  He had some type of superpowers, but he's just a regular guy.  Right.  So he didn't really know how to use him very well.  He couldn't fly, like E-Rock, he couldn't fly very well and he'd crash into things.  That's why I guess they show him like flying all silly there.  Obviously, he's just standing on one leg in that picture.  He was driving and these aliens came down and gave him a special superpower suit.  Oh, that's how it happened? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Ah, a superpower suit?  Yeah, the whole...  The suit is what gives him the power?  Yeah, he doesn't have it unless he's wearing the suit.  I did not know that.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Hey, intern Dave, why don't you interview E-Rock about his obsession with the...  Well, there's more about that gash.  Okay.  Well, what else?  Well, so when he finally got to him, you know, E-Rock introduces himself.  He tells him he's a big fan.  He loves the show.  He proceeded to tell William Catt...  Oh, he pointed out with his finger, the gash on his eye.  Oh, William, this is the gash that I got.  He proceeded to tell him the whole story about the gash underneath his eye. 
[01:55:00]  No, he didn't.  He did.  He did.  He told him about the gash.  How bored was William Catt as he was listening to E-Rock?  He couldn't care less about the gash under E-Rock's eye.  He couldn't care less.  He probably heard that a million times.  Oh, I'm your biggest fan.  I'm your biggest fan.  This happened to me now.  E-Rock is so excited and telling him about the gash.  Was E-Rock bummed out that the guy could care less?  No, he was...  E-Rock was super excited.  He was, like, in a mood.  He was so excited that he shook his hand, got a picture, got an autograph.  He was, like, going crazy.  Were you slightly embarrassed for E-Rock?  I was a little bit embarrassed. 
[01:55:30]  Why?  Because E-Rock was kind of, like, a little bit...  I think he was overdoing himself a little bit too much.  Like gushing and having, like, a man crush on him?  I think so.  Yeah?  I think so.  He was making a big, fat fool of himself.  Meanwhile, I was standing there having no clue who the heck this guy was.  I had no clue.  Yes.  Meanwhile.  When Robert Culp was there, he comes over and he's shaking hands and he says hi to Dave  and he goes, I have no idea who you are.  I don't know anything you've done.  Oh, my God.  Now, Robert Culp does have an acting career.  He's got a nice little resume. 
[01:56:00]  He was in...  You know him if you saw him.  I Spy.  I Spy with Bill Cosby.  He was in I Spy, the original one.  He was in Turk 182.  He was in a lot of episodes of Columbo.  He always played a good boy.  This guy, Jimmy.  If you see his picture, Jimmy, you'll...  That guy.  Oh, yeah.  Robert Culp.  He's been in a million things.  He was in Greatest American Hero?  Mm-hmm.  What did he do?  He was...  His name was Bill Maxwell.  I believe he was a detective that was assigned to protect the...  I don't remember him from Greatest American Hero.  How many years was it on?  Like two years, I think. 
[01:56:30]  44 episodes.  That's it?  That's it.  81 to 83.  Yeah.  And that goddamn song became a hit on the radio.  This was played all the time.  And now from the Greatest American Hero, believe it or not, here on PLJ.  Right.  Who sang it?  Um...  Good question.  And is this a...  What's his name that does all the TV songs?  Alan Thicke?  Was this an Alan Thicke song?  No. 
[01:57:00]  Alan Thicke is...  This was a biggie back in the day.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Believe it or not.  Walking on air.  Well, actually, intern David, you told me that E-Rock knows the song.  Well, he was trying to, like, get me to figure out, like, try to remember the show.  And he's like, don't you remember the famous song?  I'm like, what song?  He's like...  And E-Rock started singing, like, the first verse.  Leave it or not, I'm walking on air.  And I'm like, oh, I know that song, but I don't know the show.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:57:30]  Well, did you really sing the opening lyrics?  That's most of the song that I knew was that very beginning.  Are you mortified that intern David is calling you out on your obsession with the Greatest  American Hero?  No, because he didn't understand why I was dragging him through people so he could take the photo  for me.  He's like, where are we going?  Where are we going?  And I said, I just told you where we're going, and he gets over there, and he's all uncomfortable  telling everybody he doesn't know what they do for a living, and said hi to him.  It was uncomfortable for me, because I had no clue who I am.  I'm like, I'm taking a picture of this guy.  Who the hell is this guy?  I'm waiting for William Catt, and I turn around, I can't find David, and he's saying hi to some 
[01:58:00]  guy who's wearing a Ghostbuster outfit.  Oh, God.  David's such a collection of douches.  I know.  David's just a simpleton.  Was Big Kev there?  Oh, yeah.  I love Comic-Con, man.  I'd have to go.  Dude, it's actually fun.  You're going to smash these people, and it's like, you see these dumb celebrities, and  you're like, oh my God, when they have the Warriors show up.  It's like, I like that guy.  It was really some cool kind of D-level guys.  Were you excited for anyone over there in turn, David? 
[01:58:30]  Did you see anyone where you went, oh, wow?  Well, the wrestling people were pretty famous.  Like, the Honky Tonk Man was there, and Sam got to meet him and get his picture and autograph.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  So Sam got excited, man.  The Honky Tonk Man was there in his full wrestling outfit, like the Elvis costume.  What else is he going to do?  The Honky Tonk Man.  Yeah, so how did his song go?  I'm the Honky Tonk Man.  Cool, cocky, and bad.  Is he still wrestling?  Yeah.  Independent League somewhere?  Yeah, he does wrestling with alcohol. 
[01:59:00]  And then there were other wrestlers, like Scott Steiner was there, too.  Yeah.  Yep.  Scott Steiner.  And the guy from the Bushwhackers was there, too.  Wow.  Which one?  I think Luke.  Well, they used to come out and do that walk.  Yeah.  He was there, yeah.  I didn't want to get a picture with one Bushwhacker.  No, you need both Bushwhackers.  That's not as valuable as both, right?  Right.  The Bushwhacker is not the Bushwhacker.  Exactly.  Iraq, comment on what intern David's saying?  No, it's all true.  Ooh.  For the Honky Tonk Man, at least, yeah.  Did the Honky Tonk Man have a little work done? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, he's got some, he's very shiny under the eyes.  Yeah, yeah.  The Honky Tonk Man have a little work done.  Up in the Widow's Peaks, looks like some kind of hair restoration or something.  Oh, probably plugs, if you could tell.  Not hair restoration, where there's individual follicles.  From the harvest area.  Harvested.  Hey, intern David, anything else from Comic-Con?  Did we cover it all?  Yeah, pretty much.  There are famous celebrities.  Like, we saw, I don't know if you know, but Melody Anderson was there, who played the  female on the Flash Gordon movie. 
[02:00:00]  She was there.  Wow.  David's got, like, a photographic memory, because he didn't know any of these people.  And then I'm like, that's the Honky Tonk Man.  And he said, oh, the Honky Tonk Man.  And now he remembers every single name.  Who else?  There was one point where we're walking, and Sam and his girlfriend are a little bit  ahead of us, and we're trying to figure out other people to interview, and David goes,  there's no line for Lou Ferrigno, why don't we go over there?  And his handler is right near where David is standing, trying to draw people to the line. 
[02:00:30]  And he keeps going, why are we talking to Lou Ferrigno?  There's nobody talking to Lou Ferrigno.  Oh, that's got to suck for these guys.  That's got to be the worst part, is what do you do to make it look like things are going  as planned?  Yeah, yeah.  People had lines, and Lou Ferrigno was empty, so I was like, why don't we talk to him, try  to get an interview?  This is everyone's reality, by the way.  Fast forward 10 years, there's an old Anthony and I sitting there hoping that someone comes  up to our table.  Remember St. Patrick's Cathedral?  We're the guys. 
[02:01:00]  Ed Mayer, yeah, you get pictures of us.  Just signing pictures from us at AAF.  Here's the only thing I'm trying to get to the bottom.  That's our future, you know it, right?  Oh, no, please.  What do you got to say?  The only thing I'm trying to get to the bottom of is what actually happened at Comic-Con,  because before David came in here, Eric started yelling at him and calling him a liar.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Most of what David said is true.  I did not say nor tell William Katt that he was my childhood hero. 
[02:01:30]  What?  I believe David.  Was he on the hero list?  No, he was never on the hero list.  He told me, Eric, when we were first going up to William Katt, Eric was trying to tell  me who he was, because I had no clue.  He told me that he was his childhood hero.  I never said childhood hero.  He said it.  I told you all about the show.  And he said, oh, this is my childhood hero.  I even got a gash under my eye all because of my hero.  Yes, Iraq did.  Yes.  Here's also something that David left out.  But I did tell you that I used to have, I was three, four when the show was on, I used  to have the costume, so I used to wear the costume a lot for The Greatest American Hero 
[02:02:00]  with the cape and everything.  Stop.  It was an all red and black outfit.  Yeah, what?  And you said costume wrong.  Sam?  It's costume.  It's not costume.  Costume.  There's no S-H in it.  It's costume.  Costume.  Watching Sam's mouth is costume.  What does it say?  Costume.  Costume.  He moves his lips lower.  He moves his lips lower.  Costume.  Costume.  Costume.  Say it at home.  It's kind of fun.  After a while.  Costume. 
[02:02:30]  Costume.  Yeah.  Costume.  And people are pointing out if Intern David says proceed one more time, they want us to  hit him with a cattle prod or something.  So he was really...  Proceeded.  Yeah.  He was really...  Evoch's lying right now, but not being a hero.  Yes.  If you had a little suit, a little Greatest American Hero costume that...  Costume.  That you put on, you absolutely...  He was your hero.  Why would you ever wear that?  Like people...  Because you're three. 
[02:03:00]  Four.  You see something on television, you want to dress up like it.  No, you don't.  What?  A hundred pounds?  I think you're lying.  I think you got that scar when you were 17.  Making the whoosh noises.  You ran through your parents' house.  Whoosh.  Whoosh.  Just imagine...  As you're wearing your costume.  A chubby little E-Rock in a costume.  Do they have to get the extra large one?  Of course they did.  They're tearing the little hiney.  Are you with me?  I just want to say costume for the next hour now. 
[02:03:30]  Costume.  Oh, man.  God, what a crow you guys wore this weekend, huh?  So he was really gushing.  He was gushing.  He was pretty, like, flipping out.  He was really excited.  Yes.  Is he downplaying it now, you think?  He's downplaying it, yes.  No.  Now, E-Rock got very excited about the greatest American hero guy.  Who would make you very excited, intern David?  If they walked in that door right now, who would be the big, oh, my God, I can't believe he's in the studio with me?  Who's your big get?  I don't know.  I don't really...  I'm not sure.  You know who David really likes? 
[02:04:00]  The Indian chick from ER.  The Indian chick from ER?  She was also in Bend It Like Beckham.  Oh, her.  Yeah, I like her, yeah.  He's talking about her all the time.  How do you like her?  I don't know.  She's hot.  I like her.  I don't know.  Is she American Indian or Indian from India?  No, Indian from India.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You like Indian chicks?  Yeah.  Look at her.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Dark, nice, long hair.  Yeah.  Look at her.  He can't even look at you.  Yeah.  Do you see Slumdog Millionaire?  No, I haven't seen it yet.  Oh, you'll fall in love with the girl. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, boy.  Why don't we show him the picture?  She's pretty hot.  The star of Slumdog Millionaire.  You tell me what you think of her.  The adult version of Lottica.  Mm.  Yes.  This girl.  Tell me if you like her.  She's very pretty.  Intern David.  Where's the good picture?  She's a big star in India, I think, right?  Mm-hmm.  Is she?  Yeah.  I hope so.  She probably would be.  Oh, Danny, I saw what you did.  Danny just doesn't know the Indian name.  That's hilarious.  What?  He's trying to figure out which one is the chicken.  He's...  That is really funny.  You're gay.  I'm going through their names on the IMDb. 
[02:05:00]  So he guessed that this one would be the Indian chicken if it was a dude.  How can you tell with the Indian names?  Well, because you know what?  I'm looking at their names.  I'm like, all right, that's not going to work.  So then I start looking at their character names, but then that's not working either.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can't figure out which one was the broads.  I'll tell you if it says Latika.  Right there, Latika?  Latika, I'm sorry.  Yeah, Latika, right there.  This chick.  What do you think, Intern David, before we take a break?  Where?  I can't...  I'll make it bigger.  Whoa, whoa, wee, whoa. 
[02:05:30]  This girl.  Show him that picture right there.  Where am I looking?  Yeah, you like that?  Yeah, let me see.  Can't see.  Get up and look at her.  I know, exactly.  Everybody, let me move out of your way.  Come here, David.  Jesus.  What a bum.  That's the star of Slumdog Millionaire.  Get up there.  She's a very pretty girl.  You're scared to get too close to the screen.  She's very nice.  I like her, yeah.  What happened to the fist type of thing?  What happened to one fist? 
[02:06:00]  Okay.  Yeah, I like her.  She's very nice.  You did it again.  What's wrong with you?  David, you taught us all.  One fist away, remember?  He did the one fist, and then he moved way in closer.  Way in close.  There's a nice picture of her face.  What do you think?  She's very hot.  I like her.  All right.  She's a pretty girl.  Yeah.  E-Rock can't even get facts about Grace Morgan Hero, right?  Let's say hi to Tim.  Has a problem with E-Rock.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Tim.  Look, E-Rock doesn't know anything about this show. 
[02:06:30]  Bill Maxwell is an FBI agent, not a private detective.  I didn't say it's a private detective.  She did.  Yes, she did.  Yes, she did, E-Rock.  She said detective.  And the alien.  He said private detective.  He did, right, David?  He said private detective.  We've all heard of him.  He didn't know what he was talking about, either.  No.  In turn, David has a weird, like, memory, so.  Go ahead, Sergeant.  And what happened is that the aliens would have made Bill Ralph's partner because Bill  being an FBI agent would have an inside track to all the cases they would need Ralph 
[02:07:00]  to be intervening on.  That's all.  They had a private detective running around.  And the reason why Ralph was such a bad hero is because he lost the instruction booklet  three times during the show.  Yeah, yeah.  All the instructions for the suit?  Yeah.  Right.  So he didn't know how to use it.  Why'd they pick him to give the suit to?  Really?  Because he had a good heart.  Ew.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was the 80s.  Yeah.  Was it? 
[02:07:30]  All right.  What a terrible time to have a show.  81 to 83.  I must have been doing blow with my mom when this was on.  Yeah, exactly.  But wait, guys.  It gets better.  All right.  When the show was doing really low in the ratings, they tried to bring it back.  When Ralph gave the suit to a girl and made it the greatest American heroine for one episode.  Yeah.  It only lasted one episode?  Well, yeah, it was a girl.  Yeah.  I guess they tried to make it, but they probably tried a little spin-off thing. 
[02:08:00]  It didn't work out.  They tried to recycle Robert Culp into the role and, you know, as the liaison.  But the girl was all, you know, save the whales, help, you know, special needs kids, you know, that kind of girl.  Bleeding, hard, liberal crap.  Well, the problem is, I'm looking at the girl.  She's ugly.  Yeah.  If you're going to have her as the greatest American hero, you've got to get some.  And why would you cover up her entire body with a. . .  Wouldn't you rework the suit and show some skin, man?  She looks like Lotka's wife.  Harold Kane. 
[02:08:30]  I can look at William Catt.  It's not like they were looking for looks at any of these people.  Well, what about, let me ask you, what else has this guy done?  What's his name, William Catt?  Dude, that was it.  He was pretty much one and done.  Oh, he was in Cary.  He was the one that brought Cary to the prom.  Oh, okay.  Very good.  I forgot about that.  Very nice.  All right.  Other than that, nothing.  All right, Tim, thank you so much.  What happened in 83?  What, did he get accused of child trafficking?  It's never worked again?  Believe it or not, George, is it at home? 
[02:09:00]  Please leave a message at the beep.  I must be out before I pick up the phone.  Where could I be?  Believe it or not, I'm not home.  What is that?  From Seinfeld.  That's George's outgoing message.  In Seinfeld.  He sang it with the music.  You're talking about Grey's American Hero.  You've got to play that.  That was such a funny episode. 
[02:09:30]  Absolutely.  The way he was just kind of pantomiming the words himself.  He was just having fun with it.  It's like, where could I be?  And he throws his shoulders up.  Like, I don't know.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  You've got Sam.  You've got executive intern David.  Iraq, could you just do me a personal favor?  Yeah.  When you leave the studio, could you leave it like you flew around the house?  When you...  You've got a cash on your arm.  Incredible.  Do it towards the window.  Yes.  Or bump into something.  Yeah, I just kind of really want to say, all the way out the door, if you could just do that. 
[02:10:00]  This is what Iraq used to do as a kid.  I know it's radio, but...  I'll see how he looked as a kid.  Imagine God.  There he goes.  There he goes.  Iraq, fake flying out of the studio.  What a jackass.  I know.  The worst.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Iraq.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  You know the deal.  Popeye's runs out of chicken after the break.  How sad.  No!  I've never been.  Sam loves it.  We'll debate it.  They still have biscuits.  They're all out.  No.  Yeah.  Worst of Opie and Anthony, Iraq and Sam. 
[02:10:30]  Sam.  Yeah.  Popeye's...  The sailor man.  Popeye's runs out of chicken.  No.  Yeah.  I went to a Popeye's the other day.  I know.  I saw your Twitter picture.  You know, I mean, is there anything better?  Because when you're on the turnpike, approaching the George Washington Bridge from the Jersey side,  basically every single rest stop has Popeye's in it.  I've never been to a Popeye's.  They used to be Roy Rogers.  What are you doing?  I've never been to a Popeye's.  Where do you go?  Isn't it just like KFC?  No.  It's Louisiana chicken, not Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
[02:11:00]  Well, Kentucky Fried Chicken is grilled now.  It's yummy.  First of all, I would not have you use the C word on this show.  Chicken?  No.  Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Oh, you said it again.  Chicken.  No.  Oh, I get it.  There you go.  Wordplay.  Yeah, Popeye's ran out of chicken, and the news decided to get racist, and only air un-informed  black people talking about the lack of fried chicken.  That's something to do with a coupon, right?  Yeah, well, it's a coupon, first of all.  Coops.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Something Dane Cook says. 
[02:11:30]  Here is black people run out of fried chicken.  That doesn't sound good at all.  It's Popeye's.  Oh.  On the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This sucks cattle dick.  You're listening to the worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You fail, you fail, you lose.  Who brought in the Rochester story?  I did.  Sam.  From Rochester.  What's this all about?  Well, Popeye's ran out of chicken.  So, how'd that happen?  You can't run out of chicken. 
[02:12:00]  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, Iran's got a chick skin.  How do you run out of chicken?  They were having a special, and they ran out of chicken before dinner time, and everyone  left peacefully.  Is that what happened?  It wasn't such a news story, except that the news, I guess it was a slow news day, and  this ABC affiliate in Rochester decided they were only going to interview black people.  Why?  It's Popeye's chicken, there's no white people around.  There was no, oh, literal Jim. 
[02:12:30]  Am I an ass?  Wait, you were really giving an answer?  Well, I was joking.  No, no, no.  Jim is just giving an answer?  I was kidding.  Bring in the mind box.  I was kidding.  I was kidding.  I was kidding.  Fly Pelican.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  I was kidding.  All right, why don't we learn about Popeye's and what happens when you run out of...  Motherfucking Popeye.  Chicken.  Let's get all our black stories out of the way before Al Jackson comes in here.  Yeah.  Because we've got a preacher that's...  Good plan.  ...begging... 
[02:13:00]  Preacher David Manning begs not to give America to the Negroes, then rants about the  Kennedys.  It's another terrific story.  Preacher Anthony Ho?  Problem.  Customers at the drive-thru heard this recorded message.  Hi, guys.  It's an inconvenience, but we are all out of chicken, and we are close for the rest of  the day.  Thank you, and have a blessed day.  You can't run out of chicken.  What?  They probably had something wrong with the chicken they had.  There's nothing wrong with the chicken.  They had a sale on the chicken.  It was a special day. 
[02:13:30]  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that...  You ever see that video?  No.  That's great.  That's a good song, though.  Oh, it's great.  With the old lady.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Yeah, she's making the chicken in the woods.  That's some shit.  What?  Ghetto fried chicken.  Fucking video on YouTube, yo.  Where you been?  Where you be at, motherfucker?  See, you're diddy-bopping now.  Yeah, I'm diddy-bopping.  I'm diddy-bopping.  This is a new...  We're very...  Oh, yeah.  We're very progressive to play that diddy-bop song. 
[02:14:00]  I mean, that...  Are we?  That song premiered on Friday, and we're already playing it.  That ain't the motherfucking video, Danny.  What the fuck?  What are you doing?  Come on, man.  Diddy-bopping his...  That's it.  Get it.  This is it, yo.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Yeah.  Yeah, we go.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  You're right, mate.  Everybody wanna piece of my chicken. 
[02:14:30]  Put it back.  It ain't gonna look it.  It's way better than that diddy-bop.  It's not very a diddy-bop.  This couldn't be re-  Fry that chicken.  Everybody wanna piece of my chicken.  And it's just young African-Americans eating chicken.  And dancing to the chicken song.  Somebody tell me I know I haven't found this video.  Now she goes.  I got a plan.  Listen.  I'ma fry this chicken in my hand.  I got some hot grease and a whole chicken. 
[02:15:00]  Don't watch your hands, but you gon' be nicking them.  Big ol' thing of fried.  Spice off on them.  My fried chicken gon' take you over.  Everybody want a piece of my chicken.  They just got that fresh hot kettle fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  This is real.  It's the lady in the woods. 
[02:15:30]  Who wants to eat chicken in the woods?  Bugs on it.  It's like the Nazis used to use those videos of Jewish people.  This is like the equivalent of like David putting up a YouTube video of like him having a money counting party.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Count that money.  What's the next video?  Watermelon. 
[02:16:00]  Watermelon.  She's in a dirt in the fucking woods and there's like this people dancing and stomping for her chicken.  She frying her chicken, yo.  What is this?  She's fried chicken.  Fried at chicken.  Fried at chicken.  Let's learn why Popeyes ran out of chicken.  Who is this lady?  I want to know more.  You'll never know.  She's peaches, by the way.  I think it's peaches.  First of all, who wrote the lyrics to this? 
[02:16:30]  You got it, dude.  Fried at chicken.  Fried at chicken.  They can't wait.  Yeah, we got fried at chicken.  Fried at chicken.  Fried at chicken.  You like the wings.  You like the thigh.  And then they pick it up with their...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Why?  It's very well directed, this video.  It really is, isn't it?  They're hoping for a hit.  Yep.  Yeah, I'm going to hit.  He's dancing holding raw chickens. 
[02:17:00]  I like the white meat.  Right.  Got it.  It's so annoying.  It's the worst song ever.  But I can't stop watching it.  All I want to think about.  Everybody wants to my chicken.  Slide it back.  It's finger licking.  Anybody want to my chicken.  This is going to be in everyone's head.  Finger licking. 
[02:17:30]  You hear me?  She has on a weird blue fucking...  A weird blue hat.  Yeah.  It's like a swimming cap almost.  And she got gigantic fake fingernails.  Which are really disgusting when she's faking chicken with them.  Friday chicken.  Friday chicken.  Friday chicken.  Friday chicken.  That was a great song, wasn't it?  Fucking horrendous.  I found that on a website.  I had a feeling.  Yes. 
[02:18:00]  I don't think they meant it for the spirit that it was originally made in.  Here's the Popeye story.  Why do they run out of chicken?  And then they go on the street.  Customers at the drive-thru heard this recorded message.  Guys, it's an inconvenience, but we are all out of chicken, and we are closed for the rest of the day.  Thank you, and have a blessed day.  One woman yelled back at the machine.  People have kids, and they're trying to feed for the special. 
[02:18:30]  And you mean to tell me that we can't feed our kids?  Because y'all didn't order enough chicken?  Y'all knew y'all was having this special almost two months ago.  And that's wrong.  But no one was listening.  Popeye's on Lake Avenue was closed by dinner time.  I think that's bad, because I'm sure hungry.  No chicken.  No chicken?  They just had a chicken.  I said, I'm calling the customer service now to see where there's another Popeye's at.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  This is the news.  It's not like a joke.  It's not like a... 
[02:19:00]  Is this a skit from a comedy show?  Do these people see a leprechaun?  I'm not...  There's no editing.  There's every...  They talked to many different people.  Yes.  Had many different faces on the news.  Mm-hmm.  Just black people.  Only black people on the news.  Other locations ran out of chicken, too.  The $4.99 special, too good to pass up.  I just left Penfield Popeye's.  They were out of chicken there, so I ran to the city to this one, and they're out, too.  This is ridiculous.  They should have a tractor trailer out back with extra chicken on ice, you know? 
[02:19:30]  I was trying for you.  You said, what?  They see, Opie, they should have a tractor trailer out back with extra chickens on ice  out back, because then they wouldn't run out of chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Finger lickin'.  You remember?  Fry that chicken.  Finger lickin'.  You know?  I was trying to be my family tonight.  Can't get that bucket in now. 
[02:20:00]  Customers felt duped.  They gotta get their stuff together.  You know, they put their advertisements on, and then they don't show up for it.  They're more disappointed than angry.  You know, we've been looking forward to this day.  They advertise it on national TV.  How you gonna run out of chicken?  You know what?  The customers are right.  That stupid Popeye should not have run out of chicken.  A big tractor trailer is not the solution.  Ram's got a chick skin. 
[02:20:30]  That's how bad the economy is.  People are mad about a final chicken promotion.  Yeah.  Are we gonna give them a shame, shame, shame on you?  Yes.  Some woman is running from chicken plate Popeye's to Popeye's.  Then I went into the city, and then I went out of the Popeye's, and they was out too.  The tractor trailer is great, though.  Yeah.  They ought to have that with fucking carbone frozen on a hook in the back.  I want some fucking Popeye's fried carbone.  Fried wop.  Let's go to Matt in Arizona. 
[02:21:00]  Fried wop.  Fried wop.  Matt, what do you got?  Carpball.  I was wondering why Sam wasn't promoting the Gay Fish song by Kanye West.  I think that's the next one on the progressive scale.  What is that one about?  That's from South Park.  We have the disc somewhere.  They made fun of Kanye West.  It's on the Fish Dig episode.  It's not a real Kanye West song.  It's a South Park guy who's making fun of Kanye West song.  Oh, let's hear that. 
[02:21:30]  I can't read Steve from Bayshore.  I'll acknowledge Steve from Bayshore's genius humor.  But again, and I said this on a show the other day that I was doing from the compound.  There's 90% of the stuff I could say from Steve.  And then there's a genius 10% that just cannot ever be said on the air.  And that was one of them.  Holy shit.  Is that funny?  Why would Steve tempt Anthony?  I know.  What are you saying, Stephen S.?  Fry that chicken. 
[02:22:00]  Ryan in Alabama.  Alabama man.  Alabama man.  Hey, I watched the video yesterday.  If you notice the first lady that's wondering how she's going to feed her kids, she's driving  a brand new gigantic SUV.  Really?  Just wanted to point that out.  How about you go to the supermarket, you go to the supermarket, buy some fucking chicken  and cook it for your kids.  It's not the same.  Hold on, guys.  What?  Hold on.  Black eye alert.  Oh, excuse me. 
[02:22:30]  Let him pass.  How about that stock market, huh?  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Finger lickin'.  Are you killin' me?  Fry.  Hold on.  Another one.  Hold on.  Oh, shit.  It is.  All right.  And a very large one.  Yes.  So, how's your portfolio looking, Opie?  It's not looking that good right now.  Is it diversified?  I hope it is. 
[02:23:00]  Because of a diversified portfolio of her retirement.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Finger lickin'.  You hear me?  I like our new bit.  It's Cheez-It.  Black guy's coming.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, E-Rock, and Steve C. filling in for the tardy Sam Roberts. 
[02:23:30]  He's not tardy.  He's just otherwise occupied.  Okay.  Well, you're saying he's got more important things to do.  Yes, he does.  He's moving on.  He is.  Moving up in the world.  Steve, what's the Nanterpuss?  Oh, the Nanterpuss was this great video we found.  I don't know who found it.  Was it you or Travis?  It was Travis.  Travis found this great video for Denny's.  Was it?  And it featured this wiggly banana called the Nanterpuss, and it sparked this whole thing  where everybody was doing the Nanterpuss.  Because Travis would sing the song and do the dance.  That's right. 
[02:24:00]  And then that translates to, hey, maybe E-Rock can sing and do the dance itself.  That's right.  And you did.  Yes, and it was awful.  But it's on YouTube somewhere.  Just look up Opie and Anthony Nanterpuss.  I'm sure you can find it somewhere.  You are sexy.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to the worst.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool.  No, not at all.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, because it's a piece of shit.  By the way, we got Vinny from the Stress Factory.  By the way, the first one has come in.  It's Matt Roloff, everyone.  Oh, jeez.  You know, it has to be said.  We'll get it out of the way. 
[02:24:30]  And Vinny brought his son in today who, you know, I don't see that often anymore.  I see him when he was very, very well.  How old are you now, man?  22.  22.  Looks exactly like Vinny.  He really does.  It's creepy.  It's the same smile look.  You're not sure if the smile is going to finish happily or with an axe incident.  It's a very unsettling smile because it's like you can't tell if he's happy or if he's  like pacifying you before the attack, which is very much like his father.  Yeah, very much.  And here's the good part.  I can't, like he's 22 and he's living at home again. 
[02:25:00]  And I cannot get him out of bed in the morning to do any goddamn thing.  So last night, I'm like, yeah, I'm doing O&A tomorrow.  He goes, oh, you need someone to go with you?  Fucking five o'clock.  He's up.  You need me to pour coffee?  You prick.  Where were you last yesterday?  You found his motivation.  Yeah.  He wanted to come in and see hopefully naked girls.  That's exactly what's going on.  Right.  Hold on.  Someone also suggested something.  I just want to play it and see if it's accurate or not.  That's all I want to say for now.  Give me a bite of a little fish. 
[02:25:30]  Give me that fish.  Give me a bite of a little fish.  Give me that fish.  What if it were you hanging up on this wall?  If it were you and that sandwich, you wouldn't be laughing at all.  It's almost there.  Yeah, that's pretty close.  Somebody said it kind of sounds like Vinny, but even more so.  It's just it had to be played because me, Sam, and Travis are just absolutely obsessed with this commercial.  Are you?  It's nonstop.  And apparently everybody else is, too, because this is like nonstop across the country.  Are you obsessed with the nanopuss yet? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah!  Nanopuss!  Nanopuss!  Sam!  Nanopuss!  Get that nanopuss.  I thought it was the only one.  Nanopuss.  Nanopuss.  Are you a nanopuss fan?  Get it up.  Get it up.  Get it up, Danny.  Danny, get up the nanopuss.  He's throwing discs on the floor to get through the keyboard.  Anybody else into the nanopuss out there?  Hey, they're puss.  You know what?  You're going to be into the nanopuss after you hear this.  Just to waking up.  They're looking at us going, how do they do this every fucking day?  What happened?  Why?  It's your hour.  Why?  Danny and I are pigs. 
[02:26:30]  Maybe why?  Travis?  Two weeks ago, Danny and I were at the zoo.  Yeah.  And I'm...  Oh, fuck.  They're gay.  Yeah.  I have jokes, but I'll leave them alone.  Why'd you go to the zoo?  It was a petting zoo.  He was putting his dick through the cage and letting the little llama lick it.  Licking the small...  Licking the fucking pygmy llama.  Licking the fucking undershirt.  The shaft.  You try to, like, enjoy the zoo and you realize it just sucks.  No, the zoo was great.  We had an excellent time.  You'd love to be watching the slave trade.  We went with women. 
[02:27:00]  We didn't go by ourselves.  Yeah, whatever.  You were at the zoo.  Yeah, we were at the zoo and randomly I was like, hey, what do you think of nanopuss?  And he had never seen it, so I pulled it up on my phone and we're walking through the zoo.  Nanopuss rules.  And I'm just doing the nanopuss.  What's great is if you want to get the audience on board, Travis does a really great nanopuss dance.  Oh, do you?  And maybe you could do it for the audience.  Yeah.  Damn.  Well, I'm a nanopuss.  Should we watch nanopuss first?  Yeah.  Isn't it nanopuss or is it nanner?  I think it's nanner. 
[02:27:30]  Nanner?  All right.  Here's nanopuss.  I've never heard of it.  Here's nanopuss.  I've never heard of it.  Here's nanopuss.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Here's nanopuss.  Here's an echo.  Here's nanopuss.  All right, you got to do something, something.  By the way, you're hearing Vinny from the Stress Factory.  Are we ready for nanopuss?  Yeah, here's nanopuss.  It's nanopuss!  You can call me nanopuss, nanopuss.  And guess what?  I love nanopuss.  Isn't it time for a serious breakfast?  It's Tuesday from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m.  Denny's is giving a free grandstand to everyone in America. 
[02:28:00]  Why don't they, like, they've got to go long form.  They couldn't, like, really fully commit to the nanopuss thing.  There's lots of remixes.  Really?  Yeah!  When it was a nanopuss extended version, it's 10 minutes long.  Holy shit.  I think someone just looped it.  Looped it for 10 minutes.  What's nanopuss meets Godzilla?  I didn't know this was this involved.  It's a craze.  I'm just getting involved with the nanopuss.  You can call me nanopuss, nanopuss.  And guess what? 
[02:28:30]  I love nanopuss.  Godzilla's foot.  There's also a squish nanopuss.  One of my favorite remixes.  I don't think it's going to work for air, but it's nanopuss versus cookie puss versus Godzilla.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Wow.  Yeah, there it is.  Nice.  I think Sam pointed out that the best thing about the nanopuss commercial is when he knocks his own eye off.  Yes, he does.  Yeah, he had two eyes and then this stupid banana arm.  Knocked off one of his eyes. 
[02:29:00]  But if we put on the looped version, Travis might be able to stand up there on the stripper pole.  Sam, I think your audience is a little nanopuss.  I want to see the nanopuss dance.  Please, we've got a nice little crowd.  It's still growing up, but we have about a dozen people out there so far.  Well, if they want to see the nanopuss dance, I can do that.  You guys want to see the nanopuss dance?  Go on stage!  I don't know how good it's going to be because apparently I didn't do it.  It's going to be awesome.  All right.  It is good.  It is good.  Thanks, Sam.  All right.  Go ahead.  I'm going to put on the extended nanopuss. 
[02:29:30]  Wow.  Vinny's son, aren't you glad you came?  Fucking see.  We can't get you any.  There's no tits in here, but Travis will do the nanopuss dance.  It's really easy.  Anyone can do it.  All right.  But nobody good.  All right.  Here goes Travis.  I'm going to hit play here.  Am I going to be able to hear it?  Yeah, they'll play it over there.  All right.  Cool.  Nanter douche.  All right.  All he needs is nanopuss man.  Up on the stage.  Up on the stage.  That's what?  I'm the nanopuss.  Travis is doing the nanopuss.  Yeah.  You're doing it.  You're doing it.  The song's not over. 
[02:30:00]  I'm the nanopuss man.  This is the penitivision.  And look at the audience.  Look at the audience.  Yeah, we're only 14 seconds in, Travis.  I can't even fucking look at him.  You know what I love?  I can't even look at him.  Not a reaction from the crash.  No, no, no, no.  You know why?  Because all it is is just Sam wanting me to do the dance.  Well, who did you?  They're not disappointed.  No.  They're not surprised or amused.  They're just like, who's the face?  I had to fix a crash over here.  A computer crash.  So PalTalk didn't even see that?  I missed it.  Everyone else missed it.  Oh, no.  Are you kidding me? 
[02:30:30]  I had everything on the, yeah.  Derek brought up a really good point, too.  He should be singing the song.  Yeah, that's true.  He always sings the song.  Sing the song.  Sing the song.  This is the nanopuss.  Have some pride.  And he should be up there for like at least 60 seconds.  All right.  So according to Sam, Travis should be up there with a cordless mic, which I hope someone  is getting.  Yes.  And singing the nanopuss song.  I think so.  Yeah?  I think so.  God, I didn't know you guys were all into the nanopuss.  You've got to start talking. 
[02:31:00]  You're not.  There's a lot of singing that goes on after the show.  Love the nanopuss.  Fucking hate it.  You don't like the nanopuss?  I can't tell you the level of loathing I have.  You call me nanopuss.  Nanopuss.  Did you know about this?  I didn't even know about this.  I've never heard of it.  Yeah, me neither.  I've never gone from zero to 60 with hating something.  So fast.  What annoys me is that that's fucking famous on the internet.  Why?  How little time do you have that you're going to watch that?  It's just ridiculous.  And that this man dances like that is shameful.  It really is.  Well, you know what?  I think it was on, like, during the Super Bowl. 
[02:31:30]  It was a Denny's Super Bowl commercial.  And then it just, like, disappeared.  And now it's back.  It disappeared for a reason.  It brought it back.  You don't like football, Vinny?  You didn't see this during the Super Bowl?  I did not see that during the Super Bowl.  All right, Travis, let's go.  Let's do it right for the ground.  Anthony, are you ready with Telfo?  God, I hope this gets another zero.  Yeah, yes, yes.  All right.  Fix the crash.  It's awful.  I'm rolling the dice for a zero.  Come on, zero.  He should just keep going until they cheer.  Oh, well, I don't know if that's...  I'm kind of upset that...  Yeah, I don't think that's going to happen.  Filet of fish died. 
[02:32:00]  Fuck filet of fish.  It's all about the nanopuss.  All right, here's Travis.  You going to sing it, too, Travis?  I guess if I'll be able to hear it.  You'll be able to hear it, yeah.  Stop being so shy.  Look them right in the eyes.  I'm not shy.  I'm looking at you.  That's your audience.  I don't need to look at you.  They need to see you.  I like looking at you.  All right, let's go.  You're right?  Yes.  Here's Travis doing this.  Let's go.  Nanopuss.  This is ridiculous.  Nanopuss.  And guess what?  Get out of the way, Eron.  Nanopuss.  You can call me Nanopuss.  Nanopuss.  And guess what?  Other side.  Eron, go to the other side.  You can call me Nanopuss. 
[02:32:30]  Nanopuss.  All right, listen.  Dance, boy.  But you're sort of getting some laughs now.  Now I get it.  Now you get it.  Now I get it.  Nanopuss.  Could you knock your eyes out, too?  Danny's just stepping up there. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, you want to try it again?  No, no.  Oh, all right.  No, you're on the stage.  You didn't want to leave the stage.  All right.  He started feeling good about himself with Nanopuss.  Maybe Eric wants to try it, too?  Eron, you know the Nanopuss?  Eron, I just learned it the other day.  He tweeted about it, so obviously he should do the dance.  He's tweeting.  You can call me Fatterpuss.  Fatter douche.  All right, you ready?  This is Eron's Nanopuss. 
[02:33:30]  We're the best at doing visual bits for the radio.  That's right.  We have a dancing bit for the radio.  Who's better than us at visual bits for the radio?  No one.  Thank you, Sam.  But I love Nanopuss.  You can call me Nanopuss.  Nanopuss.  And guess what?  I love Nanopuss.  You can call me the Nanopuss.  Nanopuss.  There he goes.  Hey, I like the Eron version better than the Brad version.  Wow.  Dancing like one of the old people at the fucking Godfather wedding. 
[02:34:00]  I love it.  All right.  It's the worst.  The worst.  Move on.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  E-Rock and Steve C.  Can you believe it?  Morning.  Hi.  After the break, Mark Maron's in studio.  Yes, he's depressed.  But he has a letter to his ex-wife.  Very bitter letter.  I know.  Coming up next on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus.  You're listening to the worst. 
[02:34:30]  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  E-Rock and Steve.  It's the new power couple for 202-197.  How are you doing?  I'm doing you a favor.  We're doing the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And this one involves our friend Mark Maron.  Mark hit a troubled road as of late.  He got divorced.  Oh, it's not as of late.  He's just lamenting the fact that he got divorced.  And he's been miserable ever since.  Yes.  Well, this time he's in there, miserable as always, bringing us a letter he wrote to his ex-wife.  Oh, I remember this.  This was vicious. 
[02:35:00]  What was the letter about?  It's just scorn and hatred and lava and brimstone and fire.  But it's here for your amusement on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to the worst.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool.  No, not at all.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, because it's a piece of shit.  Opie and Anthony, Mark Maron in studio.  We love when Mark comes in because we've been following, I guess, your breakup.  My breakdown.  Your breakdown.  And now my coming back together. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, I guess the divorce is finalized, he was telling me.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was finalized at the end of November.  And I don't know what...  Wait, wait, wait.  How long was the whole process?  I don't know.  I don't remember.  Anthony went years.  What did you do wrong?  No, no.  Three years took me.  Well, look, there wasn't that much money, and it took her...  Same with me.  Well?  Same with me.  No money.  No house.  No kids.  Nothing.  And it took three years.  Well, I guess...  I don't know what the hell happened, though, but the interesting thing that after her... 
[02:36:00]  You know, after the shakedown, after she hired her thugs to keep coming at me...  Yeah.  Was eventually...  We went...  You know, I told you last time I was here that we had that hearing, right?  They had the hearing where she, you know, went, you know, and she should have been wearing  a barrel.  You know, remember?  Right, right, right.  I'm retarded, and I can't work, and he's my daddy.  Look, I wrote a book, but the thing was, that was the most heinous thing to me.  All in all, so we waited six months for the results of this hearing, because I thought 
[02:36:30]  I was going to settle it.  Six months.  Finally, after I make a settlement offer, because I got a new job, and I was being on  the level the whole time.  All I wanted, Anthony, all I wanted was to hold on to the house that I paid for with  my money.  That's it.  That's not asking for much.  It was outside of the marriage.  You know, we might have been together, but it doesn't matter.  She didn't make that money.  I made that money.  But I'll tell you one thing she's doing now, is she's sitting in a coffee shop, having  a coffee with my money.  No, she ain't up yet. 
[02:37:00]  She'll probably be up at about 11.  All right?  She'll go to the coffee shop.  She'll give the guy at the coffee shop $3 of my money to get her coffee and sit down  and shop for shoes and say she's writing.  Look.  Am I being callous?  See, you know, this stuff is starting to build up, because you know what I realized?  What happened to me was that there was still part of me that thought, like, you know, I'm  going to get her back.  Oh, boy.  But wait.  It took a long time to kill that.  Yeah.  I tried to get it out through my, you know, through sex.  Uh-huh. 
[02:37:30]  You know, I tried to get her out of my heart that way, and I couldn't.  And I don't know what the hell happened, but something just gave way.  You know, the divorce was...  Finally.  Finally.  Finally, I realized this isn't all my fault.  Yeah.  It's not my fault.  And what she did, and I understand why she left.  Not a problem.  But here's something you should never do, all right?  I figured out who she was living with.  She's living with some dude, right?  Well, of course.  But I didn't...  But all she told me was that he was a screenwriter.  So I let it go with that, because I don't care.  What do I care, right? 
[02:38:00]  But then I got a little time one afternoon.  So I'm like, how about a Google project?  Oh.  How about...  Why don't I do a Google project?  Here's a couple things you don't Google.  You don't Google to figure out who your ex-wife is living with, and you don't Google this.  I wonder what this lump is.  Don't ever do...  Because neither one of those...  Don't come out good.  ...are going to end up well.  Right.  So I find out who this guy is.  Honestly, honestly, I don't care.  There's part of me that just wants to reach out to this guy, you know, and tell him, you  know, what I've been put through by this woman, because you know she's not telling him. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, of course.  So listen, Jeremy.  Jeremy.  Somebody wake Jeremy up.  And the weird thing is, is how I found it.  I Googled my wife.  I found some pictures of an event that she was at for this woman who was a sculptor, and  it turns out it's this kid's mother.  So I just put two and two together.  I saw the picture.  I got his name.  I Wikipedia'd him.  Then I IMDb'd him.  Wow.  I know everything about the guy.  That's some good detective work.  But is that stalking? 
[02:39:00]  I don't think so.  I think it's just seeing what's going on.  Tell me the truth.  Am I looking like an ass here?  No, no, no, because it was covert.  You're not, you know, going over there and going, hey, who's in there?  I have no desire to do that.  You just use the resources at hand, but sometimes that will do more damage to you than good.  He's not a comedy guy.  He's a regular guy.  He writes on a popular show that just got back on the air.  Really?  Yeah.  He's writing on a show.  Doing well.  Well, I don't know.  I think he grew up with a certain amount of privileges, like a Soho rich kid, comes from 
[02:39:30]  a big family.  The curiosity got the best of you, Mark.  Well, the curiosity got the best of me.  Which is fine.  But here's what happened.  I was trying to be so good during this whole process, but then I started to realize, like,  she doesn't even care what she put me through.  All right?  So then I wrote one of those letters.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  No, you know the letters that people say, hey, okay, it's good that you wrote it.  Don't hit send.  Right.  And I'm thinking, you know, maybe I shouldn't.  You know, this ain't going to make me look good.  It felt good to write it.  I'll just put it aside. 
[02:40:00]  Copy, paste it into your notes.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  And then let it sit.  For four days, I let it sit.  Uh-oh.  And it was talking to me.  Oh.  It was sitting there for four days, and I'm like, I'm not going to send this letter.  And then, like, I wrote her a nice thing, you know, because we had had some engagement  about money, and I was like, well, okay, you know, okay, you know, good luck with  everything, and I hope you have a good life, blah, blah, blah, and nothing.  I get nothing back.  So then I'm like, you know what?  Screw this.  I'm going to edit that letter.  I'm going to make it a little nicer, and I'm going to send it.  I deserve, I'm entitled to my anger. 
[02:40:30]  So you rewrote it, a little rewrite, a little punch.  A little rewrite.  You punched it up a bit.  Yeah, I punched it up a little bit.  I tried to be as honest as possible, and then I close with it on stage now.  Really?  I'm doing a show based on the divorce.  Look, you know how much pain and aggravation and money the last two years has cost me?  That has to be creative time.  I paid a lot for this disposition.  Because you know what?  The thing about pretty women is that they're con artists. 
[02:41:00]  I thought something else.  You had a rough time saying con.  They're con artists.  I hear you now.  All they got to do is show up.  Show up.  Oh, no, I wasn't saying that.  I wasn't saying the other word.  Look, I wish you the best.  Seriously.  That's very noble.  I hope her book does well, even though she told me it was a pretty lightweight rendition of her childhood.  But I wrote the letter.  Do you have the letter?  You can't carry it with me all the time.  I do.  Can we at least see the letter? 
[02:41:30]  Can we read the letter?  I'm just trying to be honest.  Yeah.  We like the honesty.  So you know when you write a letter like this?  Mine has headings.  They're headings.  Wow.  Yeah.  That is an organized...  That looks like a resume.  And you know when it's a letter like this and the first heading is, just want to clear a few things up.  Oh, boy.  That it's going to be straight.  It's going to be honest.  I've never written a letter like that.  It's usually a quick email with a lot of Fs.  No.  No.  I wanted to be honest.  I did.  I really did. 
[02:42:00]  I'm just trying to figure out whether this is the right or the wrong thing to do.  No, it's the right thing.  Of course.  You've got to get it out of you.  Do I got to get it out of me?  Yeah, because you seem happier.  We went through a period with you where you were just completely miserable, which made for good radio, by the way.  But I fell for you personally.  But now you're looking happier.  And I think you should continue the process.  And I think if you read the letter, I think you're going to finally be done with this.  I know I wasn't the perfect husband, but I tried.  She knew what she was going into.  And just the bottom line is that I supported her for at least five years. 
[02:42:30]  And she could do whatever the hell she wanted.  I wanted her to have a creative career.  She wrote five or six scripts.  She wrote a one-person show that I encouraged her to do.  And then she sold this book deal.  And as soon as she was negotiating that book deal, as soon as the paperwork was done,  she leaves me and a week later signs the contract.  So that, okay.  Now, is that a coincidence?  Is it a coincidence?  How are you not getting a piece of that money, though? 
[02:43:00]  Because I'm a good guy.  No, because you're a guy.  No.  You don't even need the good guy.  All I was trying to do was hold on to what's mine.  And she dumped thousands of dollars into lawyers.  And then, okay.  So here's what I said.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll read some of the letter.  Yeah.  People are begging for the letter.  Are they?  Oh, yeah, they are.  Well, I'll just read this paragraph first.  Because, I mean, some of it is a little sad, I think.  You know, the first one, like, I just want to clear a few things up. 
[02:43:30]  I said, after the January 1st payment, I owe you nothing.  I've been good about the money because it's just money and I honor my debts.  I've been relatively decent in my exchanges with you post-settlement because I really don't want to cause any more pain or chaos.  Deep down, I love you and I liked you as a person once.  It really has taken me this long for me to surrender all hope of any kind of relationship with you and to give up my desire to spend any kind of time with you.  I'm a stubborn sucker.  I've made many mistakes and I have regrets about how things went down, but I was falling once you cut me loose. 
[02:44:00]  And it has taken me this long to grab hold of a root sticking out of a wall of this deepening pit.  See, a little nice approach.  I like that.  It's poetic.  Although, everything else kind of went gray on me right after I heard you tell her you love her.  That kind of hit me between the eyes.  Wait.  Let me approach the new man concept.  Now, I want you to understand something.  I don't care about this guy.  You know, it's not an issue about who she's with because I know what that guy's got to go through. 
[02:44:30]  See, he's in that place now.  I was with her from the age of 23 to whatever she is now, 34, 35, I don't know, 32.  All right.  So, I was 23.  For eight years, I was the guy.  I was the guy that laid it out.  Do you understand?  So, whatever she's telling him.  Because, you know, he's like, you know, am I good as him?  Is this right?  Did he do it like this?  Am I as good?  No way.  There's no way.  I'm sure they'll find their own groove. 
[02:45:00]  And I hope they do.  That's something they can live with.  But, you know, I know everything.  You don't hope they do.  I know when she's faking.  I know when she's not.  I know when she's, you know, walking through it.  You know, I know when she means it.  Yeah, he's got to learn those things.  And he is in the shadow of what's in my pants and what was in her for eight years.  Right.  All right.  Is this wrong?  No, no.  I'm just thinking there's also the part of it, though.  I don't mean to, you know.  I'm just saying there's a part of it, though, where they're at that beginning, cool phase of, you know, where you hang out. 
[02:45:30]  But what are they, both broken birds with a couple of broken-winged people?  I mean, how do you get into it like that?  I understand, but I don't think.  Well, Mark, what Ann's saying is, you know, six or seven times a day.  Yeah, you know what it's like when you're first to go.  You don't know my ex-wife.  Really?  All right.  But, no, look, I hope they are.  It really isn't bothering me.  Okay.  Well, that's good.  Can you see that I'm a bigger man than that?  Can you see that?  I can see that.  Yeah.  Now. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Steven S. from Bayshore, was Mark menstruating when he wrote this letter?  Well, let me read you the rest of it.  Let me read the rest of it.  Back up a little bit, because people had a little problem with the love part.  All right, here.  Well, this is one of these letters where you're done with your ex and you just paid her a lot of money.  That was the opener.  That was like, I'm smoothing it up.  An attention getter.  That's right.  Yeah.  All right.  Here you go.  Here you go.  See, the second heading, sociopath.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Well.  Okay.  All right.  Now, there's some of this you're not going to understand, but you'll get it. 
[02:46:30]  I said, you accused me once of being a sociopath, yet you just now, quote, unquote, heard what  being left may have felt like for me, and that you don't, quote, unquote, blame me.  She said those things.  The idea that you are completely entitled to everything you have done in the last year  and a half, that you deserved it, then your reaction to something you won't get, among  other things you have done or said.  All of these things imply not only a lack of empathy, but a pathology.  You are not only detached, but delusional.  You are a self-serving animal driven by a broken core toward survival and opportunity 
[02:47:00]  at any cost.  Damn.  All right.  That is an insult and art.  Makes up for the love line.  There's more people that think I'm some sort of wuss.  I tried to be nice.  So this is with the other guy, her Harvard guy, her rich kid boyfriend.  Oh, how snarky he must be.  I don't know how he is.  He's probably a snarky writer.  Snarky.  He writes little snide jokes.  All right.  I'm not going to do it.  It is a legal show.  That was a good header right there.  That was a good paragraph. 
[02:47:30]  Here's another one.  All right.  Maybe the upgrade will help you.  Maybe effing a working screenwriter will get you where you need to go.  If your book doesn't sell, I would seriously consider, as I'm sure you are, convincing  this guy that you love him.  You could also just let him be in love with you and you can just show up.  You have experience with that.  Ultimately, you should have a rich guy's kid.  Then at least you can be guaranteed a living for the long haul instead of extorting money  from guys who are struggling to stay afloat while trying to extend their first small wave  of security and success into an unknown future. 
[02:48:00]  Damn, that sounds like something somebody else in this room could have written.  Yeah.  Am I still a wuss?  Am I still menstruating?  No, no, no.  No, no.  That's too mean.  Huh?  I'm kidding.  Now I'm too mean.  No, you're having a fine comeback here with your letter.  That letter, from what you're saying, because you're very close to this letter.  I mean, you've probably toiled over it and changed things around.  It's you.  It's coming from you.  From an outside party, you're showing a lot of feelings for her still in this letter. 
[02:48:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Even through all the...  Wait, then wait.  Abuse is the next heading.  Abuse.  Right.  Abuse.  Now this is for you.  Okay.  And look, I'm copping to my side of it, because I'm trying to be honest here.  Yeah.  I'm not in love with her anymore.  I don't want to get her back.  I may want to get back at her a little bit.  Uh-huh.  But I'm just trying to detach here.  Can you feel that?  What are you trying to get out of this letter?  All that and more?  Jim, do I deserve to be angry? 
[02:49:00]  Do I deserve to be angry?  Well, anger is a luxury afforded more balanced people.  I'm not capable of handling anger.  So what, you're capped in recovery this morning?  No, no, no.  But I'm saying...  You can be angry, but I'm saying that I personally...  It's very rough, because the rage...  Of course you should be angry, but it's very hard to be, you know...  I'm trying to be diplomatic here.  Listen to this.  Okay, abuse.  Do you see?  I was emotionally abusive during our marriage, and I will carry the burden of that for the  rest of my life and hopefully change. 
[02:49:30]  In terms of you being abusive during the marriage, that is not on me to parse.  I can only assess my side of things.  That is your side of the street, so to speak.  All right?  Now, listen to me.  I know I did love you.  I know I do know you.  As far as abuse after you left, I hired a lawyer to process a divorce and protect what  I thought was mine.  You hired lawyers to act as thugs and shake me down.  You hired them to bring me to my knees.  You paid legal gangsters almost this amount of money, of our money, and provoked me to  spend another this amount more on my side in a bad economy to hurt me as much as they 
[02:50:00]  could financially, mentally, and emotionally.  You behaved like a jilted trophy wife married to a millionaire.  You lied, cheated, and stole to serve yourself.  In the end, considering the judgment of the courts, your thugs lost their argument but did  succeed in breaking me financially.  Again, it's only money.  Ultimately, I made a fair settlement offer based on what I could afford on my own volition,  founded in a strong desire not to dump more of my money, threw you into a shakedown that  you thought you were entitled to.  It was also dubious, given that you could have walked with so much money without hurting 
[02:50:30]  me.  That is abuse, subcontracted abuse, the act of a coward.  It's really pathetic that you talk about how much you hate your lawyers like they're  somehow separate from you.  They are you.  You paid them to be you.  Wow.  Oh, jeez.  Okay.  That's good.  You like that one, right, Ant?  Oh, do I like that one.  I think a lot of guys out there like that one, Mark.  Yeah?  You're speaking a...  I might have to borrow that.  You're speaking a language that people can understand right now.  Yeah?  That's a good one.  Are you going to do one of these letters when your payments are done in? 
[02:51:00]  No, no.  I'm not doing anything.  You just want to...  But the thing is, I'm not...  The thing I don't get, man, you know, I'm not slandering her.  It's just that after a certain point, I was sucking up all the pain.  I was sucking up all the blame.  You know, I took the hit for whatever her dad did or didn't do, and now I got to live  with it.  But there are some things that...  The only thing I'm mad about, Anthony, is the shakedown.  It's the waste of money, the entitlement.  I mean, this is a woman that, you know, she planted a garden at her house, and when we  were leaving, when she was leaving, she goes, I think I'm going to have to take some of 
[02:51:30]  those cactuses.  Yeah, I mean, how petty.  I think I got to take some cactuses.  And the bottom line is that she wanted to be a comic, and she got on board with me for  eight years.  You know, and on some level, given the timing of when she left, I have to see it as opportunism.  Is she doing comedy?  I don't know.  Did she get funnier?  It doesn't sound like it.  It sounds like she got sad.  But the fact of the matter is, is that now she's a writer, so who's she jumping in bed  with?  Who's she living with?  A writer.  All right?  Am I being an idiot?  Is there logic in that?  I see some kind of a pattern there. 
[02:52:00]  We just saw a picture of your ex, by the way.  Where?  Where?  We have our ways.  Is that her?  On the left?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll look at him.  Yeah?  That's the whole picture, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look, I'm just trying to get myself respect back, you know, to assess the situation as  I see it in retrospect.  It becomes about the money to a certain degree, because I understand divorces are ugly, and 
[02:52:30]  I know this woman.  And the fact is, is that after she, see these lawyers pimp people out, you know, she was  being pimped by her lawyers, you know, and screwing me, and I'm paying for it.  And then at the end of it, she's like, my lawyers took advantage of me.  Can I have some more money?  Like, you know, I just, you know what I mean?  It's just after a certain point, it's like, you can't distance yourself from that.  I know why you left me.  You deserve a good life.  But you can't, like, she acts like she was plugging away on her book.  I was being tortured by these Jewish bitches. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  All right?  Every day, I had to go into my garage and dig up more crap to copy, to photocopy, over  and over again.  Oh, tell me about it.  You know, for months and months, and they never let up.  And that's what she paid them to do.  She paid them to brutalize me.  That is exactly what I went through as far as having to get things.  Oh, we need this.  We need your taxes from this.  We need that.  And then there was something called potential earnings, where they came up with this figure 
[02:53:30]  of what I could possibly make in my career.  That's what she did.  And they lost.  They lost.  They lost.  See, that's where I folded my hand, because I was getting scared, like, oh, boy, they're  talking a lot of effing money here.  They tried to make that argument.  The thing that eats me the most is, you know what we do.  You know what Jim and I do.  Do you know what, you know, before you became big, did you know when you were going to get  your next chunk of money?  Did you know if you were going to get another job?  Who the hell knows?  No.  I still panic. 
[02:54:00]  This business is ridiculous.  That's right.  So she gets his lawyers to make this assumption, to make an assumption that, like, look, he  made a few, he had a couple of good years for the first time in his life, hosting a radio  show in the middle of the night that arguably destroyed his marriage.  So that means we got to look at this money as an aggregate, as an average.  He's capable of making this money.  So she gets the payments on this amount of money.  I said, that's completely ridiculous.  I'm in show business.  There's no way.  So we fought that.  That was what the hearing was about.  So then, you know, after the hearing, I get an opportunity to get a job.  What did I do?  I copped to it.  I told her what was up. 
[02:54:30]  I made her a settlement based on the new job, and that was the end of it.  Then we get the hearing from the judge.  He awarded her, he awarded her spousal support on one year's money on the income that I made  in that year and the same year that she made just as much.  It was like $900 a month.  So all that money that she dumped into these lawyers, they lost.  They lost it.  So I just fought because I thought it was right.  But she was willing to lie under oath and to make herself sound like a victim, like a  retard, like a moron who couldn't work.  And that was the thing that killed me the most, Anthony, was that she made this declarative 
[02:55:00]  statement about, this is my statement.  And basically, it was, I gave up my life for him, and he bought me nice dinners.  Right?  And this is not the woman I married.  I married a like-minded person in the same business as me who I gave the opportunity  by not expecting her to work to do what she did.  And then she writes that letter.  Here, here's the way.  Business as usual.  Last heading, respect.  By the way, I'm getting her.  You want to wake her after the break? 
[02:55:30]  No, people are applauding, man.  All right, respect.  This is really the saddest loss for me in retrospect.  Despite whatever you may think I thought about you and your craft, creativity, and talent,  I respected you deeply and wanted so much for you to realize your talents and gifts.  I am happy that you are.  Your declarative statement to the court changed everything that I thought about you.  I'm sure it doesn't matter, really, to you.  You thought it was just part of the process.  You claimed that your lawyer wrote it and you signed it.  It doesn't matter.  It was a piece of writing that you put your name on and filed with a court of law.  It was a lie designed to make you look like an uneducated victim of circumstance who gave up 
[02:56:00]  her life for someone and was in desperate need of reparation.  It was heinous.  It was written by you in the eyes of the court.  It isn't the perjury aspect that is disturbing to me.  That is a legal issue that you are apparently comfortable with.  It is the fact that you were willing to lie, cheat, and steal to hurt me and get what you want.  That is the single most important piece of writing you will ever do in my eyes.  Even if you say you didn't write it, it said so much about who you are more than any book you could ever really author. 
[02:56:30]  I believe that once documents are filed with a court, they are public.  I haven't figured out how I will use them, but that piece of writing signifies the death  of almost everything I believed in in terms of love and illustrates perfectly the lie that  love becomes.  It really shattered the illusion.  It is an amazing piece of writing in context.  Depositions, things like that, they're written by lawyers.  Lawyers, lawyers write them, and then you sign them as if it's your opinion or your recollection 
[02:57:00]  of things.  But they don't, the lawyer writes it.  Like, mine, yeah, I did the same thing.  I wrote mine.  I wrote mine.  Yeah.  I wrote mine based on what I had been through.  The truth.  The truth, right.  The other one was like, I read the other side and was just flabbergasted.  I'm like, who wrote it?  But they put their name on it.  I know.  It's perjury.  Isn't that legal perjury?  It's perjury.  So then I said at the end, I'm not sure that I really owe you much respect after what you 
[02:57:30]  put me through.  I have to figure that out.  I will keep talking publicly about this until I feel better, die, use, alienate everyone,  or surrender.  And then, like she had said, that I'm a tough act to follow.  Then I wrote this one.  As far as being a tough act to follow, that would imply you have an act.  Oh.  All right.  That hurt.  That was a good one.  A lot of people saying you still care, Mark.  So what?  How what?  It's not a matter of caring. 
[02:58:00]  It's just a matter of a certain amount is that this culture, this legal culture is  designed, it's designed to entitle women to screw men.  Now, and the bottom line is, and I'm being a misogynist here, this is not undocumented  stuff, I understand spousal support, but how it's been exploited by these lawyers, the  truth of the matter is, if you're a woman, you've been married to someone for 15, 20 years,  30 years, you've had kids, you brought up kids, you did your part in the marriage and  everything else, and then all of a sudden you went to the world, you can't worry. 
[02:58:30]  I understand, you deserve money, because you have to start a life over again.  Yeah.  That's what it was for, and it was a fair thing.  That's why it's on the books.  But these idiots, these evil bastard lawyers and bitch lawyers, what they do is they exploit  that.  I mean, I was married for three and a half years, I was with her for eight, when she  left me, she was 30 years old, completely capable of working, had half of my money coming to  her automatically, which she says, I didn't know that that was, I had that, bull, bull. 
[02:59:00]  She could have done anything.  The truth of the matter is, she didn't want to have to get a job, she felt entitled to  my money, and all I can say is, Jeremy, I hope you like the Christmas presents I bought  you.  Yeah.  Hey, we got a woman on the line, her taking this whole thing.  Let's see what Wanda has to say.  Wanda, PA, what's up?  Yeah, I mean, every time he reads that letter, she wins again.  How's that?  Because she's still renting space in his brain.  Renting space?  Yeah, okay, she's not, she may be renting it there, but I've limited the amount of space 
[02:59:30]  she's renting in my heart every time I read the letter.  So eventually it will get out of my brain.  Just work it out of your brain.  The best thing, if you send that to her, I didn't know you sent it.  I did.  I'm not going to read it, I didn't send it.  I put my money where my mouth is.  I just hope that the guy she's with heard it.  What would you do if she sent back an email and it just had a bunch of Z's in a row?  Oh, wow.  You know what, Jim?  Knowing her, she'll probably steal that idea.  Nobody sent me that, thinking I might not have heard you said it. 
[03:00:00]  I only asked that because I got a really irritating one recently from somebody in my past that I thought was unfair and that my temptation was just to put a bunch of Z's and mail it back to them.  And I just didn't.  You know what's sad about this is that, like, I know what this is.  This is malignant evil.  You know, I should suck it up.  I should have some acceptance.  I should rise above this because this is exactly what my father does.  He sends these letters.  But there was part of me, because I sat on this thing. 
[03:00:30]  I made phone calls to friends.  I said, you know, I wrote this.  You know, I'm a little obsessed.  And they're like, well, don't send it.  Let it sit.  And I let it sit.  And the bottom line is, is I started to realize that every, like, I was starting to think, granted, I behaved badly.  Granted, I slept with people she knew.  But, you know, I never lashed out in anger during this divorce process, ever.  You know, whatever I did was to make myself feel better.  But I was not going to lash out in anger.  I tried to be as diplomatic as possible.  But then all of a sudden, I had this realization one day when I had said something to her over an email, over money or something. 
[03:01:00]  And she calls me up crying about something.  You know, about, like, you know, I didn't know you were doing it.  And it opened my heart right back up again.  And I was writing that thing with her.  And I got off the phone.  Click.  Right.  Well, no, but the thing was, what I realized, like, I thought every time that happened that, like, you know, we're going to be friends.  And then I realized, wait a minute.  It's manipulative.  You know, it's damage control.  You know, I mean, she wants me to shut my mouth.  She wants me to shut up and give her the money and move on. 
[03:01:30]  She thought that we would just be friends.  She thought that, hey, it's just divorce.  It's what people do.  I never did it.  I was in love with her.  I never did this.  My first divorce, I walked away from it.  I had no money.  I wanted out.  Okay?  So I had no experience of this.  This is the first time I experienced this.  And it's a life-altering experience, dude.  It changes your life.  It certainly does.  And I wasn't going to just let it slide.  And people are like, you don't have kids or whatever.  It doesn't matter.  A broken heart is a broken heart.  You may have other responsibilities.  You may have other financial responsibilities. 
[03:02:00]  But the bottom line is, if you sit with this stuff and you blame yourself, you're either  going to become a more humble person with a little more humility or you're going to become  a bitter bastard.  Apparently, I'm still on the precipice.  Let me tell you something.  After nine years, I'm still on the fence myself, too.  I am very bitter about what happened because I'm still paying.  Nine years later, and I'm still writing checks. 
[03:02:30]  Two more.  Two to go.  Two to go.  Two payments to go.  It doubled the time you were married.  That's so sick of me.  No, I was married nine years.  And then nine years later, ten years later, you're still doing it.  And now I'm still paying.  And it was based on a lot of what you had said, things that were in, you know, written  responsibilities that, you know, if you would have read one side of this court case, you'd 
[03:03:00]  have thought, I would not be sitting here if it wasn't for her.  Yeah, well, that's her.  Which is complete crap.  That was her argument.  And you'd be nowhere without me.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  The money I bought the house with was based on a deal that had nothing to do with her.  Yeah.  And the story had nothing to do with her.  The comedy had nothing to do with her.  I was a construction worker for most, for the majority of our marriage, I was a construction  worker making $29,000 a year.  That's what I was making.  I had finally broken through in radio, wasn't making millions, believe me, was making a good 
[03:03:30]  living.  But this, that potential earning thing came in.  You only made a good living the last year that you were married with.  No, I wasn't even married at that point.  I was already going through it.  We were negotiating a contract.  Okay, right.  And that effing lawyer waited, postponed every time I had to go to court.  And I had to go there, sit down, postponed, and I'd leave.  And I had to postpone it every time until I had to sign my new contract. 
[03:04:00]  And then they went, well, look what he makes.  She wasn't even involved in my life at that point.  See, that's, see, that it's, it's criminal.  Extortion.  It's criminal.  It is extortion.  Because they, they, and then they think, everyone thinks that this is just the way divorce is.  It's an abuse of the justice system.  Yeah.  Because in all fairness, man, I filed for divorce with a lawyer because I didn't know how to  do it otherwise.  Yeah.  And I wanted to keep the house in the sense that, like, she's like, but you always said  it was our house. 
[03:04:30]  I'm like, yeah, if we're living in it.  Yeah, right.  So we're living in it.  We're married.  So why should I be concerned?  I used to say that to her because I bought the house before we were married.  It was in my name.  And she says, your accountant conspired against me.  Bull.  My accountant conspired against me.  It's like, why would it matter if you plan to stay married to me?  Yeah.  Who's got the house now?  Me.  Oh, good job.  Yeah, great.  Now it's worthless.  Do you have to sell it?  No.  Oh, that's good.  No, it's like, that's better than most people. 
[03:05:00]  We bought it.  I bought it at the beginning of the bubble.  It's still worth what I pay for it, if not more.  And you know what?  I'm happy I got the house because I went back for two weeks.  I like my house.  Good.  Hey, this is Mark Maron.  You're listening to the worst of Opian Anthony.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  The virus.  You're listening to the worst of Opian Anthony.  It's the worst of Opian Anthony.  The guys are on vacation.  So, E-Rock and Primetime Sam Roberts are here hosting as always.  Correct.  And we have a guest in the studio, Sam. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Who could it be?  Nobody important.  It's intern Paul.  Hi.  Hi, Paul.  How you doing?  Now, we're intern Paul.  Yes.  This bit that we're doing here actually involved you in some small way.  Yeah.  Involved him or involved someone he knew.  I stand corrected.  Somebody you knew.  Somebody you brought to the studio and became a bigger star than you'll ever be.  Yes.  So, this is Corinne the Naked Teen.  Yeah.  Apparently, we found out that Paul used to date Corinne. 
[03:06:00]  The Naked Teen?  The Naked Teen.  Wow.  And you used to date.  Did you ever get naked with her?  Yeah, when I was younger.  Wow.  Cool.  Anything else that you could give us the insight on this?  Yeah.  Do you want me to tell the story or are you just going to let me say it?  Yeah, every ten minutes.  Why did you bring her up there for the first part?  Oh, well, a few years ago, I really wanted to meet O&A and I thought, well, what better  way than to bring a woman to get naked for him?  To do Guess What's in My Pants.  Guess What's in My Pants live in studio. 
[03:06:30]  But it took a while for them to get to that because they realized she had a very childlike  voice.  How childlike was it?  I got nothing.  You're just being a dick.  What do you mean?  We're interviewing Paul because he was there.  Do you still have any photos of this girl?  I gave them to you already.  No, that was one photo and she was just sitting on a couch.  Oh.  You're saying like good photos.  I could probably find some.  She actually emailed me a couple days ago saying she found a bunch of pictures, so.  Why didn't you just take some pictures?  It's her. 
[03:07:00]  I haven't seen her in...  No, why didn't you?  You just said she emailed you saying she found pictures.  Of us.  Her and I.  Oh.  We didn't want the pictures of you and her.  I know.  Just her.  I can get you pictures of just her.  Okay.  Let's do that.  And while he's getting us photos, let's listen to this awfulness that is Corinne the Naked  Teen on The Worst of Ovi and Anthony.  I'm definitely glad you got the inside scoop from Paul.  I know.  It's the worst.  Worst.  Of the Ovi and Anthony show.  Well, we got a lovely young lady in the studio, Anthony.  Look at Corinne.  Yes.  Hello.  Hi, Corinne.  Hello. 
[03:07:30]  How are you?  I'm doing good.  And yourself?  You sound shy.  How old are you?  I'm 19.  19?  Yep.  And you decide you wanted to play What's in My Pants live on the show?  Yeah.  My boyfriend somehow coerced me into doing it.  Coerced?  We love coercion.  That's great.  Your boyfriend is basically making you do this?  Basically, yeah.  Making you?  Not making me.  I have my choice.  I volunteered.  Right.  Oh.  So I'm here.  Very lovely lady, Blonde.  Did he join you today?  Yeah, he's outside. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, great.  He's not even going to be in here while we play, which is great.  Oh, that's good.  Do you know how to play What's in My Pants?  Not exactly.  Ah, okay.  Well, everyone gets naked.  Of course not.  No, those aren't the rules indeed.  So what do you think the game is played?  How do you think the game is played?  How would you think one would play the game What's in My Pants?  The use of a microphone against a certain private area. 
[03:08:30]  Ah.  Let me, let me.  Yeah.  So far, so good.  And then we guess what's going on in your pants.  Okay.  And you have no problem with this?  No.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Yeah.  All right.  Very cool.  So you want to get naked?  Totally naked.  No, you don't have to get totally naked.  Well, you just keep going.  We'll tell you when to stop.  Don't be shy. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, that must be shifted.  Wow, she's pulling down her pants.  All right.  Wow, she's got nice little black panties on, right?  Let's check that out.  Very nice.  Whoa.  A black tea bag.  That's nice.  That's what they call a tea bag, Anthony.  Take them all the way down?  Yeah, sure.  Sure.  Let her rip.  Let them rip.  Oh, very nice.  That is very, very nice.  Bravo.  What are your dimensions there, Corinne?  My dimensions?  Yeah, dimensions.  She's in 3D. 
[03:09:30]  All three dimensions.  I would hope so.  You got the blonde hair.  What color eyes?  Blue.  Blue, I see that.  Okay.  And what's your measurements?  My measurements are 34, probably 24, and maybe 32.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Is this our first teenager getting naked in the studio?  Teenager.  Hot teens.  Hot teens.  See?  See what we had to do?  Let's see.  Step over there.  There we go.  Okay, now orbit.  Orbit. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Look at that.  All right.  Very nice.  Bravo.  Oh, yeah.  The home audience is getting a little pissed that she's standing by the console.  Well, here, bring in the boyfriend.  What?  What are you?  Just first.  First, what are you?  Bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip.  Hey.  For a second.  What's your name, man?  Be quiet, sir.  It was great talking to you.  Yeah, thanks.  All right.  We'll see you in a little while.  Get thrown in.  Of course you are.  Absolutely.  Check it out on the computer like everyone else. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  All right, Ant.  Do that.  So, should we play What's in My Pants?  Yeah.  Do we need her to stand still so the internet audience can check this out?  Well, yeah, I would think so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you pull it up at least?  Maybe show the bra?  I'm sure you got a sexy bra.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Have you wowed yet?  No, I haven't.  Not yet.  Would you like to?  I don't think so.  That's okay.  We don't force any of the ladies to do it, right? 
[03:11:00]  Not on the air.  Opie and Anthony, the home of naked teens.  Thank you, Pete.  Yes.  Pete checking in from work.  Cup size?  People want to know your cup size?  I'll tell everyone.  I believe 34B.  No, you're wrong.  A?  Yeah.  Really?  Really?  It's a full A yet.  Yeah.  Who brings you nude teens?  Opie and Anthony, home of nude teens. 
[03:11:30]  Very nice.  Could you crawl around on the floor for a while?  Yes.  He's giving me a look, actually.  I didn't know that would be inappropriate.  I'm sorry.  Can we write stuff on your belly?  What do you want to write?  I don't know.  Give me a magic marker.  What can we write on you?  Do you like having your background? 
[03:12:00]  I'm over here now.  Yeah.  Yes.  I'm sticking in my mouth.  Vagina.  Oh, come on now.  All right, and we don't want her to leave.  Let's be nice.  Would you like to write something on her belly?  What would you write?  Like a letter?  What are you saying?  I don't know.  All right.  Let's play What's in My Pants with Corrine.  You feeling okay?  I'm feeling fine.  You sure?  I'm positive.  You look horrified.  We don't bite.  You all right?  Sure.  Yeah, you're backing up for the microphone and everything. 
[03:12:30]  Have we mentioned that she's a teen?  Yes.  I don't want our listening audience to let that slip by.  Yes, indeed.  We're catering to the...  Could you hang out without your shirt on?  It's kind of like wearing a bathing suit.  Say it yourself.  How old are you?  Me?  I'm 19.  Ah, there you go.  Just turned?  About a month ago, yeah.  Ah, how old were you maybe two months ago?  18.  Just graduated high school?  No, I graduated a year ago. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Could you take your shirt off?  It's like wearing a bathing suit.  Well, I have two shirts on.  Two?  Oh, yeah.  Two?  Ponderous.  F-ing ponderous, let's say.  I have a tank up underneath.  Fascinating.  Oh, no.  We need the bra.  You need the bra?  Yeah, it's like wearing a bikini.  It really is like the beach, isn't it?  It really is.  There we go.  Wow, you have a nice body there.  An undressing teen right here on the show. 
[03:13:30]  Teen getting.  Wow.  Okay.  That's good for the home.  See, it looks just like.  You're playing the home game of the Opie and Anthony show.  It looks just like a bathing suit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  It does.  Can we turn around and see the tee back again?  For the camera.  There you go.  For the camera, of course.  Not for us.  Not at all, huh?  This is an interactive radio show, so if you want us to do things to Corinne, please send  in the instant feedback.  Yeah, see?  Now, that's a teen ass. 
[03:14:00]  That brings tears to my eyes.  Very good.  No, she graduated high school.  I feel like I'm taking her virginity.  Virgin?  No.  No.  Wow.  Oh, really?  Really, yeah.  Ponderous effing ponderous.  Three input, woman?  Have you dealt with all three orifices?  No.  During sex?  No.  No.  Let's guess which one she hasn't.  I would say, let's see, during any one of these sexual encounters, were you able to 
[03:14:30]  speak?  Any one of them?  During the one that we're, you know, talking about.  No.  See?  Okay, so it's not that one, Anthony.  I know what we're talking about.  Butt sex.  What's that, Mr. Garrison?  Butt sex.  Yes.  I guess that's what we're talking about.  The hoop.  Yes. 
[03:15:00]  The balloon knot.  The leather Cheerio.  The brown ring of design.  Chocolate starfish.  Whatever you want to call it.  Yeah, well, that's not.  Thank you, Brett, my brother.  Okay.  Very good.  Let's see.  Nude teens.  Barely legal teens live on the O&H show, Anthony.  Very good.  What's your naked teen station?  Can we have you rub lotion all over your body?  Oh.  Well, is it all over? 
[03:15:30]  Well.  Or is it just certain areas?  Well.  You know, it wouldn't be like.  You need to specify.  Your thumbs.  Can we draw the map of Hawaii on your stomach?  No.  Oh, like with a lotion.  You know, someone just goes.  Yeah.  Get the lotion.  Get the hand lotion.  Get the lotion.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  That's right.  Typical guys.  We got just a body shot.  No shot of her face.  It's on the spot.  Yeah, look.  God. 
[03:16:00]  That's cool.  Wow.  It looks like her ass ate her underwear.  No, that's a teabag.  No.  Come on.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  She's hot.  My ass isn't that big.  Let's see sweater meat.  Ah.  How about a quick sweater meat shot?  What would that be?  A little flash?  A little flash?  Nope.  Wow.  That is an adamant nope.  I think we found her limit.  Time.  All right.  I think that's it.  Screw you guys.  I'm going home.  No, no, no, no. 
[03:16:30]  Let's go to Ralph on line two.  He's having a problem with this segment of the show.  Ralph, what's up?  Yeah, I'm 19.  I feel like I'm doing something wrong watching this.  Oh, there's nothing wrong with this.  Believe me.  We're going to reenact the Central Park groping in a minute.  Oh, sweet.  Stay tuned.  All right.  Hopefully we'll have a few less Puerto Ricans this time.  All right.  Thank you, Ralph.  All right.  Corinne, would you be offended if we all just poured water all over you?  Oh.  We got the lotion.  Give her some lotion.  What is that? 
[03:17:00]  Give us squirt.  Shake it.  Comes in a pump dispenser.  Give us squirt on the belly.  Yeah.  There you go.  Boy, you're a real trooper.  I try.  That's good.  Can we put your hair in pigtails?  Oh, my God.  No, people.  Whoa, what happened?  Jeez, man.  There she goes.  Wait, wait.  No, no.  You got to just splat it.  Let's go.  Oh, that's the move.  Okay.  Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
[03:17:30]  Yes.  Oh.  I believe she said.  I didn't catch it, but I believe 19.  I may look like I'm 12.  What?  I may look like I'm 12.  Yes.  No, she doesn't look 12.  No, I've seen a lot of 12-year-olds in bra and panties, and no, no.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  That's right.  Corinne is beautiful.  If you were ugly, this would have taken two minutes.  Yeah, you'd feel flattered the longer you're in here. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my thank you.  You may set the record soon.  Lock the door.  Yeah, lock the door.  Frank, what's up?  Hey, I'm thinking maybe you guys could see if maybe she wants to be your next waxing customer.  Well, we have to play What's in My Pants with her.  That's why she's down here, you know.  Oh, that's true.  This is just the preliminary interview.  We all forgot about that now, didn't we?  What is the thing for What's in My Pants when it hasn't grown in yet?  Come on, I'm kidding. 
[03:18:30]  She's 19, for God's sake.  AstroTurf.  Just in case you forgot.  Mike from Jersey, can she do a simulated masturbation scene?  Yeah, that's very funny.  Can you?  Woody Allen checking in.  Don't let her go anywhere.  I'll be there soon.  I got an idea for a sketch.  How about me hack her up into pieces?  Put her in a barrel.  Come on.  Someone checking in on instant feedback. 
[03:19:00]  What is that, a teen?  Yes.  Our first teenager on the O&A show, Anthony.  All right.  I guess we've got to take a quick break, and then we'll see what's in Corinne's pants  next, right, Ann?  Oh, my goodness.  I finally got instant feedback.  That's why.  I'm just reading through.  Can you give her a Popsicle or an ice cream cone to lick?  Let's see.  I'm just going through an instant feedback.  Matt from Jersey, you guys make puberty fun.  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  Tell her to do a split for you.  Do you do any gymnastics or anything?  No, I'm not that flexible.  No, huh?  No.  Okay.  Let's see.  Where's the wiffle ball bat?  No sick F from Jersey.  That would be wrong, Anthony.  All right.  We'll take a break.  All right.  We'll play What's in My Pants with Corinne, who's live in the studio right now.  Nude teens.  Nude teens.  Very, very cute, Anthony.  Yes, Opie.  We'll be back. 
[03:20:00]  Where's the Opie and Anthony show?  Oh, my goodness.  For some reason, Opie, I don't know why, she just decided to put pigtails in.  Not off of anybody's prompting in here.  Who got her to put in pigtails?  Opie.  So she's putting pigtails in her hair right now.  Getting ready to play What's in My Pants live with Corinne.  Corinne, she's a teenager, ladies and gentlemen.  Bill.  Bill.  Cowbell Bill made it in.  Habiel.  What's up, fellas?  What's up?  You picked.  See, you finally picked a good day.  I know, right?  We have nude teens here on the Opie and Anthony show today. 
[03:20:30]  I see that.  Corinne is 19 years old.  Yeah.  Has this also got something to do with a foot fetish?  Well, we got some lotion.  All we could find was lotion just for smooth feet.  But it works all over.  It rubs the lotion in.  Or it gets the hose.  What happened to the pigtails, man?  She's working on it.  No, Steve, that's still too far back.  Yeah, you got to be side of your head pigtails.  You got to get the pigtails on the side.  It's been about a year and a half since she's done that.  She's out of practice. 
[03:21:00]  Not by much.  Very good.  And while she puts the pigtails in her hair, let's make her feel comfortable.  Yeah.  It's a little awkward.  She's got ten guys gawking at her, so let's make her feel at home here.  That's it.  Okay, terrific.  You like the Britney Spears? 
[03:21:30]  I think I did it again.  Oh, wow.  Suddenly this is getting really hot.  Someone get her a sucker.  Go get her a lollipop, man.  I'm serious.  Run downstairs and get a lollipop immediately.  Yeah.  That I'm serious.  There we go.  This is so wrong.  I can absolutely not get on instant feedback. 
[03:22:00]  People just pounding instant feedback.  And Matt B. from Westfield, New Jersey.  I just set a land speed wrecker driving home from work to see the cam.  Own a rock.  You've got to be kidding me with those pigtails.  Corinne, are you having a good time or what?  Here, you've got to talk into the microphone.  Is it fun?  Yeah.  I'm having a great time.  You having fun?  Yeah.  Cool.  Now, the pigtails are kind of hard with the headphones. 
[03:22:30]  It's embarrassing that we have these CDs in the studio, Anthony, but they're helping  the bit along today.  Like having your background.  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  Like having your background.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Ah, man, this is Doug Kent.  Yeah, it is.  Fantastic.  Ah, yes.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Where did that come from, Anthony?  Pep from Jersey Checkin' In. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, my God.  I saw her on a carton of milk the other day.  I threw away.  Last seen 95.  This is so wrong, man.  What a girl won't, what a girl won't, what a girl won't, what a girl won't, what a girl  need.  Yes.  There you go.  Hey, what does a girl need?  Hey.  Butt.  Dang.  AJ from Boardyard Checkin' In. 
[03:24:00]  Damn it, what happened?  Cam just got all blurry and blotchy.  Oh, wait, I did that.  Stan wanting to know if she's wearing underoos.  Are those underoos or big girl underwear?  I don't know what they are.  Those are big girl undies, aren't they?  Yes.  Yes, they are.  I gotta go to John.  Oops, I did it again.  All over my keyboard.  John, what's going on?  Yeah, I'd just like to thank you guys and Corinne for catering to the needs of the children 
[03:24:30]  today.  I appreciate it.  Just leave us on for a couple more minutes, and I should finish.  Yeah, Mike is saying the camera is like the perverted Make-A-Wish Foundation for kids  who are more sick in the mind than in body.  Sean from Long Island wants to know if she's ever had thousands of guys simultaneously while  staring at her.  I don't think so.  No.  Welcome to it, then.  All right.  Hey, that girl in this cam looks like a teenager. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  Did we say?  Nineteen.  Just turned.  Nineteen.  Yes.  Hi, Daddy.  Well, hi.  Hi yourself.  Hi, Daddy.  Oh, no.  Do you hate your daddy?  No, not really.  Not really.  Uh-oh.  Are you getting him back for something he did to you?  You don't want to get into the psychological thing of this, do you, Opie?  Corinne, could you repeat after me? 
[03:25:30]  She sells seashells by the seashore.  She sells seashells by the seashore?  You shut up, Buddy Hinton.  Wow.  What else can we make her do?  Okay.  Well, are we ready to play What's in Corinne's Pants?  Oh, that's right.  We got Cal Bell.  That's why we were here.  We got Cal Bell Bill in the studio.  Hi, Bill.  What's happening? 
[03:26:00]  Finally made it on a good day, see?  You know, yeah.  One out of 20 times?  Yeah, I know.  You've been here 20 times.  He walks in.  It's like just a bunch of guys.  Kevin comes running upstairs.  He's like, oh, man, you've got to check this out.  She's hot.  Daddy, can I put up my doll now?  Oh, God.  He's making her say things.  That's okay.  Keep writing.  That is sick.  Dad from New City, will you guys be my cellmates?  Yeah, we don't have the Catholic school uniform. 
[03:26:30]  I'm sorry, guys.  AJ saying, I'd like 600 boxes of Samoas and 300 boxes of Thin Mints.  Were you ever a Girl Scout?  What?  No.  A brownie?  Nope.  No.  You want to be?  Do we have a uniform here?  And the lollipops arrived.  Ah.  Oh, ho.  Ah, ha.  Oh, no.  Give her a sucker.  A sucker.  Yes.  I believe these are called blow pops.  Is it a blow pop?  They're a blow pop.  Oh, yeah.  They're Charms blow pops. 
[03:27:00]  Very nice.  Well, Corinne's got a blow pop.  Corinne's taking it in my mouth.  Yes.  The blow pop, of course.  The blow pop.  Penises.  Daddy Anthony, Uncle Lopes.  You're a sick F.  Point on the doll where he touched you.  Right.  He touched me where my bathing suit covers.  Yeah.  Ah.  Oh, ho, ha, ha.  Oh, ho, ha, ha. 
[03:27:30]  Ah.  People want you to play hopscotch in the studio.  Hopscotch?  Yeah.  Hopscotch.  You ever play hopscotch?  Uh-huh.  Opie, that's an old game.  I feel dirty.  Yes, you are.  We're going to have to cleanse you.  That's great.  You're going to get sent to bed early.  That bed that you have with all the little stuffed animals on it.  And Daddy's going to come up and maybe give you a little spanking with his belt. 
[03:28:00]  Spank me.  Yeah.  A little spanking.  That's right.  This is going to hurt you more than it does me.  We're going to just have to give you a little spanking.  Anthony, John from Queens.  Yeah.  Now this is what I call Total Request Live. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  This is what we can do.  Come on.  Daddy, I'm your bad girl.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Ah.  What's the good one?  Look, she's got the little lollipop in her mouth now.  All right.  The blow pop.  All right.  If we're going to play that game, give me a pen and piece of paper.  Oh, what?  You're just going to make her say things?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Give me one, too.  Let's just make her say stuff.  Can I have a pen?  Yeah.  Me and Bill need pens.  She's got the same things. 
[03:29:00]  I'm a dirty girl.  No, I got one.  I'll be writing.  Writing.  Oh, yeah.  We'll play pass the pen.  Here you go.  Okay.  Give me the pen.  Pass my note to Corinne.  Daddy, Mommy doesn't have to know.  Thank you. 
[03:29:30]  Thank you.  You guys could send in instant feedback.  We'll have her say stuff.  Here, give me another pen and piece of paper.  Daddy, you're so big.  I don't know what that means, Anthony. 
[03:30:00]  Should I wear pink panties or no panties?  All right.  Corinne, do you like 60s music?  Holy smokes.  Yeah, actually.  We're sitting there with the pigtails, the blow pop, saying these incredibly horrible things. 
[03:30:30]  Bend me, shave me any way you want me.  She hardly looks 19.  That's Michelle from Brooklyn.  I've been such a bad girl.  Brian, what's going on?  Yeah.  What's up, Brian?  I'm killing myself trying to get home so I can see this girl.  She's adorable, man. 
[03:31:00]  Britney Spears?  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Thank you.  You've got to get a Catholic school uniform.  All right.  All right.  Thanks.  Daddy, give me it.  I don't know what that means, man.  Hey, guys, when did we get to Amsterdam?  All right.  Yeah.  Give her that one.  That's from one of our listeners.  I'm going steady and I French kiss. 
[03:31:30]  Sorry everybody does that.  Yeah, but Daddy says I'm the best dad.  Joey, I lied to me.  Joey, what's up?  Oh, my God.  Joey.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, and hey, you're killing me.  Let me tell you, I've got a 12-year-old daughter who probably looks just like this little one. 
[03:32:00]  This is terrible.  I mean, I can't be, you guys have to tone it down.  I mean, you've really gone over the edge.  Oh, we'll tone it down right now.  Please leave the studio.  What's that noise, Daddy?  And you guys have got the best job.  All right.  Thank you, Jerry.  I love it.  Thank you.  Have fun.  All right.  Another listener coming up with something for Corinne to say, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  Okay, the listener's coming through with some good stuff.  Go ahead. 
[03:32:30]  What's that in your pants, Daddy?  Anthony, do I look as young as your girlfriend?  Very funny.  Is it bath time yet, Daddy?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:33:00]  All right.  I'm just reading instant feedbacks again, Opie.  Very, they're just coming in so fast.  Of course, Cam, a big hit today.  Very hard to get on it, I think.  I think I did it again.  I love you.  She's sucking on the blow pop, Anthony.  A blow pop.  Yeah.  It's the Earl model. 
[03:33:30]  Should I wear my training bra while we do it?  Smells like a brand-new yo-yo.  Yeah, it does.  Daddy, why do you stare at me when I'm changing?  What's a tampon?  That's okay. 
[03:34:00]  I don't mind being on my knees.  Oh, there he goes.  Two.  This is total.  We're in the middle of Total Request Live. 
[03:34:30]  Yes.  The listeners coming in with their requests for our 19-year-old Corinne to us.  Daddy, can I sit on your lap and tell you what I want for Christmas?  Daddy, what's the leather Cheerio?  Oh, my God. 
[03:35:00]  What happened?  We were having a fine show.  Daddy, can I give you a hummer?  Whoa!  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yes, very naughty indeed.  Everybody writing so quickly here.  I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Pups. 
[03:35:30]  No, Daddy, it doesn't hurt.  Oh, no.  You people are horrible.  Let's see.  We need to see another ass shot.  Oh, you guys.  I can't even read some of these.  Oh, I know.  Daddy, look what I did to you again. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, my God.  It's too friggin' funny.  Daddy, I love when you touch my bad place.  Oh, my God. 
[03:36:30]  We're going down.  Daddy, I'm under here now.  Okay.  Well, Anthony.  Wow.  What a nice surprise today.  Fabulous.  We still haven't even played Guess What's in My Pants.  No.  The whole reason that she came down here. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, 19-year-old Corinne is in the studio, Anthony.  She's 19?  Just turned.  Oh, I didn't even know that.  Just turned it.  Daddy, show me your monkey.  Okay.  Show me your monkey.  Okay.  Terrific.  Well, are we okay?  Yeah. 
[03:37:30]  Yes.  Well, people keep asking us time and time again, what are you guys going to do next?  Hot teen sex.  Daddy, I'm really hot.  This is wrong.  Yes, it is, Anthony.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Well, should we...  That's a good one.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[03:38:00]  Line 12, but you can't...  Come on.  I don't know.  Give it a try.  Write it down, man.  Let me see.  I don't know.  Technically.  Oh, Jesus.  Daddy, it won't fit my mouth. 
[03:38:30]  I have no idea what she's saying, Anthony.  All right.  Here, give her that one.  That's going to be a showstopper right there.  Listen to this one, Ant.  This tastes so good.  She's talking about the blow pop.  We went down to the street, Ant, and got her some blow pop.  I know.  Okay.  Daddy, my poopy hurts.  It does, though. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Daddy, what's that in the popcorn bucket?  That old cat. 
[03:39:30]  All right, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Let's...  What?  What?  Everyone's all distracted.  Daddy, can I eat some meat?  All right, Ant.  Let's take a break.  She's hungry.  Okay.  And we'll finally play What's in Corinne's Pants.  Yeah.  She's in her bra and panties.  And we'll play that next.  Stay there.  It's the worst.  It's the worst. 
[03:40:00]  Of the O.B. and Anthony show.  Yes, it's the O.N.A. show.  We're hanging out with Corinne.  And look at the picture on the cam.  There's a picture of her.  She's 19 years old, Anthony.  Really?  Just turned.  She's got pigtails.  Why didn't we bring that up earlier?  I don't know.  It's just the detail that slipped by.  She's got a lollipop in her mouth.  She's in her bra and panties.  And she's got a stuffed animal.  And the listener is just flooding the studio with things for Corinne to say, Anthony. 
[03:40:30]  Someone's got to write it down.  Oh, okay.  Daddy, feel how smooth it is.  This is wrong.  That is so bad.  This is wrong.  Daddy, why are you sneaking into my bed again?  Boy, this will be harder to do when I get my permanent teeth in.  Come on. 
[03:41:00]  Grandpa, you're so much bigger than Daddy.  Oh, no.  Oh, the horror.  Well, that could mean anything.  Right?  It's not obvious.  He's taller.  It can mean many things.  Well, okay.  If it will get me an A.  Here, like, try this one.  This will make it through.  I thought you needed a thermometer to take my temperature. 
[03:41:30]  Daddy, can I come, too?  What?  What?  The guy's going out.  He's gone, and then she wants to go with him.  Sure.  Maybe her little brother is playing T-ball or something.  Of course.  Yeah, T-ball.  T-ball.  All right.  All right, Ant.  You know, yes, Opie?  Yes?  We've done the pre-what's-in-my-pants interview.  Like we do with all of our contestants. 
[03:42:00]  Yes.  We spend this much time with everybody who comes in the studio.  All right, Ant.  Let's play What's in My Pants.  Yes.  Corinne and her boyfriend came down and played this today live.  Play that snappy tune.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  What?  What?  Place the receiver upon your beaver. 
[03:42:30]  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  Hoorah!  A lot of people checking in before they hear a sound saying,  wood floor, wood floor, wood floor.  Don't say a thing, Corinne.  Or as they would like to call it also, the JonBenet Ramsey.  All right, I guess we're ready to play.  We're ready to play.  Corinne, why don't you stand up?  There she is with the little bun bun and the blow pop in her mouth. 
[03:43:00]  Pigtails.  Pigtails.  Now she's standing up, and we are going to play Guess What's in My Pants  with the lovely 19-year-old Corinne.  Wait, I mean, I want to look, but then it would wreck the game.  Boy, that's bittersweet, isn't it?  You know?  Do you care?  I think I cheated.  Yeah, I cheated, too.  I think I know.  It was an accident. 
[03:43:30]  Who cares?  I don't even give an F if I get disqualified.  Okay, we're going to play Guess What's in Corinne's Pants.  All right.  All right, you know the rules.  You rub it on the most intimate of areas, and we guess what you have in your pants.  Well, you've got to turn around.  All right, we'll move close to the counter.  Okay, I can turn around.  There we go.  I turned completely around. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, my God.  This is wrong.  I can't see the bunny rabbits in the way.  Good.  You want me to describe it?  Get out of the way, Mr. Bunny Rabbit.  I want to see Mr. Beaver.  All right, she's got the microphone.  Let's make sure.  All right, rub up and down first.  Interesting.  Interesting.  Okay.  You've got to get used to the acoustics of the microphone instead of the phone. 
[03:44:30]  Yes, yes.  Go side to side.  Side to side.  A little more, a little more.  A little more.  Indeed, yes, yes, yes.  Rick.  And now the circular motion.  All right.  You know something?  Do we even have to challenge here?  For the love of God? 
[03:45:00]  That's it?  That's it?  Do you really need any more?  Are you ready?  Oh, yeah.  Wait, wait.  Now we're ready.  For why?  I bet it would be easy for you to play what's in our pants right now.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Changing my pocket, stop making noise.  You always come up with the best lines, man.  I'm freaking Bill. 
[03:45:30]  All right.  You know, I don't know.  If I go first, everyone's got to follow suit.  No, we're all going to say the same thing.  Yeah.  You want to say it on three?  One, two, three.  Wood floor.  Or in this case, the Tweety Bird.  Yeah.  We all have to say wood floor.  Just from your personality and the way you look, I would feel that that would be how you're groomed.  But also, the sound that was made, or wasn't made, was truly indicative of the JonBenet Ramsey. 
[03:46:00]  So, should we get the answer, I guess?  I'm saying she's packing an Olsen twin.  Ouch.  All right.  Corinne?  Yes.  What is in your pants?  A wood floor.  Yes!  Oh, it makes it even better, doesn't it, kids?  100%.  Wow. 
[03:46:30]  And how do you groom that?  How?  I just shave it.  Shave?  Yeah.  And when did you shave?  I haven't yet.  When?  The last time?  Yeah.  Yesterday?  Last night?  Yesterday.  And where are those clippings?  There was a little five o'clock shadow thing happening there.  Was there?  Tiny bit.  Tiny bit, Anthony.  We're going to give her some Mujan, right, Ant?  Does she need Mujan?  Wood floor.  When did you shave?  What's shaving?  What's hair? 
[03:47:00]  What's hair?  Well, very good.  Wow.  Well, Ant, unfortunately, I guess we've got to thank Corinne for coming by for the last  two and a half hours.  Why?  There's still another hour and 20 minutes left of the show.  Why would you have her leave?  And her boyfriend, take that mic there.  What's your name again?  It doesn't matter what the name is.  No, what's your name?  Just kidding.  My name's Paul. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, damn.  All right, it's Paul.  Oh, you got that out?  Yeah, unfortunately.  We were going to play the limo game with you.  No, Paul and Corinne, Anthony.  They'll be hanging around.  If we can figure out other stuff for her to do, we'll do it, right?  Yes.  How long have you two been an item?  Four months.  Four months.  Four months.  Four months.  Wow.  That's it, huh?  Yep.  Hmm.  You banging?  Yeah.  He said he was trying to get anal from her. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, my God.  You don't go there first.  That's not the first stop on the train.  Yeah.  Prom guy is going to try to get anal.  Trying to get anal.  Hope you got a shoehorn, my friend.  That's 19 over there.  Jesus.  Analyze.  My God.  It's going to sound like tightening up a two-by-four on those old wooden vices.  You know the squeak sound those were made? 
[03:48:30]  That's what that'll be like.  Well, good luck to you.  Yes.  Good luck in your venture for anal.  What do you think?  You think you'll ever give that up?  It ain't happening.  Ah.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Has he tried?  Yes.  You know that little move where it's like, what?  I didn't know.  It slipped.  Exactly.  That old gag.  It slipped.  It slipped.  Yeah, so did this.  Oh.  This is my knee.  You tried the slip move? 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  That doesn't work.  But isn't that look on their face priceless?  Did you try the have another hit move?  Yeah, try booze.  That's a good one.  Daddy, I don't like anal.  Oh, come on.  All right.  Well, I guess we'll unfortunately let her leave.  Yeah.  Well, it was great.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah, say that one.  Yeah, that'll work. 
[03:49:30]  Don't even.  Don't even.  Don't even say that.  That's where I drug a little ride.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  With anal and that.  Glad to see you have a line.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  She does the other thing, though, right?  The oral thing, right?  Yeah.  Pretty good.  Good?  Good.  Nice technique?  Wow.  Really?  You grab those pigtails like a handlebar of an old Schwinn.  Right? 
[03:50:00]  The tassels hanging off your bike.  The tassels.  Just put a bell on her head so you can cling, cling, cling.  Oh, really?  She completes to full completion.  Wow.  Let's go to Frank.  No fuss, no mess.  Let's go to Frank.  Just like latex paint.  Easy cleanup.  Frank, what's up?  Hey, you guys.  I thought what you did on Friday was bad.  Yeah.  But I don't know now.  Yeah, well, that's how this show goes. 
[03:50:30]  Right when you think we've gotten as sick as we possibly can, we take it to just about illegal.  Just keep up the good work.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  All right, bye-bye.  Thank you.  Well, we're going to have to say goodbye to Corinne and the guy, Tony or Bill.  What's his name again?  John.  John?  How long before you had sex?  Two.  Not too long.  I'd go third date.  No.  No longer?  No longer than that.  Yeah.  Two minutes.  It took a while. 
[03:51:00]  Was he your first?  No.  Did you get the oral thing first and then days later you moved on to?  The sex stuff?  Yeah, it was slow progression.  Slow progression.  Does he reciprocate?  Yes.  Very nice.  How about that?  Wow.  It's like shucking a little neck, right?  Come on, everyone has gone to a clam bake or something. 
[03:51:30]  All right.  Well, it's truly time to say goodbye.  Time to wrap this up.  Unfortunately.  Now it's an hour and 15 minutes.  It doesn't show up.  It's Corinne and Paul.  Whatever.  So it's Corinne and Paul, Anthony.  Very good.  Bravo.  Good job.  You've got to love it.  The crowd on their feet.  Would you come to the live show and dress in the JonBenet Ramsey cowboy outfit? 
[03:52:00]  With a garret around your neck?  A garret.  All right.  New teens.  Very, very cute, Anthony.  Yes, I'll be.  We'll be back.  Worst of Opie and Anthony, you think it can't get worse, but it does because you break out  some of the Real Rock tapes.  What are the Real Rock tapes?  Eric, please explain for everybody.  Real Rock tapes are the TV show that ONA used to do when they were serving time in Boston.  Real Rock TV was the show. 
[03:52:30]  Yes.  It was terrible.  Cheesy bits.  And here's some of those bits coming up after the break on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yes, it's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Is it?  Yes.  Where are we?  We are hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  No, but where are we right now?  Right now, we are sitting in the studio hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  No.  As of this airing, where are we?  Hmm.  I don't know.  Where are you?  I am at a bed and breakfast with my lovely wife.  Doing what?  Having sex. 
[03:53:00]  Ew.  Anyway, so Real Rock tapes.  You know the Real Rock tapes.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, this is one of them.  We'll give you the details you figured out here on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  You remember these.  You did bad.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sorry about that.  I was going through the old Real Rock TV shows.  Yes.  I saw that on your Twitter.  I got every single show, it turns out, that we did up there in Boston.  And I'm going to be putting a Real Rock TV clip up just one a day for the next couple 
[03:53:30]  of weeks.  Just one a day.  I'm holding back.  I got five more douche chill clips ready to go.  And that's exactly how it was described.  Oh, yeah.  Wait.  Can we get the audio of this?  You get to see Rocco.  Dude!  No way!  Rocco's the one that looks like Danny McBride.  I haven't seen this, by the way, since we've done it.  It was posted after I kind of hit the hay there, and I couldn't get it on my iPhone.  Yeah, I got other things I want to do as far as side projects go, but this is going to take 
[03:54:00]  up my time for the next easily two or three weeks.  I got a stack of tapes that go from the floor all the way up to the ceiling.  I am prepared for a douche chill moment.  And I'm watching these things going, I don't even know what I'm going to see.  I don't remember this stuff.  And then it pops on the screen.  I'm like, oh, my God.  And for the people that think that they got one on me, you don't think, I know that I'm  putting this stuff up there.  You're the one putting it up.  My wife couldn't watch half this stuff.  She was embarrassed. 
[03:54:30]  She goes, you're representing both of us these days, not just yourself.  This is the most douche-chilly thing I've ever seen in my life.  Why do you like being uncomfortable?  Why do you throw yourself under a bus?  I'm like, I don't know.  I'm representing Captain Hook's fish and chips.  Dude, she didn't think this was good quality stuff.  I love how Jimmy asked those obvious questions, knowing what the answer is.  Wait, so you didn't like this?  You thought this was bad?  I know we all know Ope's wife, and I can just picture the face watching something. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, it's just douche-chilling.  She openly just starts laughing, not with me, but at me.  She just openly starts laughing.  I'm like, why do you like being uncomfortable?  Oh, my God.  This is awful.  I understand what this looks like 10 years later.  I understand that.  So shut your trap and enjoy some nostalgia, some Opey and Anthony nostalgia.  With that, we'll give you the audio version of the video that's now up on YouTube. 
[03:55:30]  Here it is.  We'll describe it.  We're all at dinner.  Yeah, you can stop it for a second.  Oh, this is a Thanksgiving thing.  Yeah, we were doing a Thanksgiving bit for Real Rock TV, and all the jocks are around  the conference table having a full Thanksgiving dinner.  Yeah, yeah.  And that was Chris, I think his name was, from the Hillman show, who actually was always  a cool dude, by the way.  Hillman's a douchebag.  He showed his true colors when we got fired. 
[03:56:00]  He's an asshole.  I'm looking at Rocco.  Yeah, but the guys that worked with him weren't that bad.  And Chris is doing the Charlie Chaplin, like, two dinner rolls with, like, little  pencils in them to make legs dancing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  That's how the video starts.  And then I'm, uh...  That's Rocco?  That's Rocco.  That's Kenny Powers.  Dude, I got a mullet.  Rocco.  I think that's the first look at Rocco ever.  Yeah.  We've been talking about him forever.  Yeah, that's it. 
[03:56:30]  Wow.  Dude, I've been hearing about that guy.  I feel like I'm watching Zellig.  Like, there he is.  There he is, dude.  That's Rocco.  All right.  And then I'm taking a nice big bite of turkey.  All right.  To start the bit.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  What are you going to hear?  I'm cold.  Hold me.  I think the setup should be, I'm swallowing a big piece of turkey, which is going to lead  to me choking.  Oh, okay.  That's the bit premise.  Yes.  All right.  Because then Anthony gets very excited.  Oh, no.  Do you even remember what you did here?  I have no clue what this is about. 
[03:57:00]  I'm ready to just get a douche chill.  All right, hit it.  Oh, no.  There's me swallowing the turkey.  Oh, God.  But I never even had any kidneys.  No!  You all right?  Oh, you okay?  Oh, wait a minute.  I know what that means.  It was a place to ring.  Okay, all right.  Two words.  First word.  Don't like a gag.  Cag.  Cag. 
[03:57:30]  Cag.  Wait, wait.  Wait.  Oh, no.  He's choking.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  I'm choking.  You're a heimlich.  I'm a heimlich.  Opie, stay calm.  Stay calm.  Uh-oh.  It's gone.  Wow.  You all right, dude?  You all right?  Yeah, thanks.  You have to let people know the sight gag they just missed.  Oh, we're going to.  We went for the big sight gag.  Big laugh you guys missed.  See, I was choking. 
[03:58:00]  Opie is choking.  And Anthony gave me the heimlich, which we didn't show on camera because we don't touch  each other ever.  And then.  So you had to just believe that it was giving me the heimlich.  Oh, God.  And then the turkey comes out, right, Jimmy?  Well, you don't see it.  What you see is.  Yeah.  You see Opie choking, and then all of a sudden the camera goes to the table to a pan where  a turkey would go, and then, by golly, a turkey just flies from off camera into the  pan.  You have to assume that's what he was choking on was the whole turkey. 
[03:58:30]  The entire turkey carcass.  Yes.  Yeah.  Which was, I guess, caught in his throat.  Yes.  See, I don't know.  But then.  There's too much to talk about for that visual, man.  Wow.  Wow.  That's one of many, my friend.  Oh, gee.  I will hold back, but sometime after, I don't know, noon today, the second clip will go up.  One a day.  I'm going to hold back.  I'm going to just do one a day.  Very excited to see the next clip. 
[03:59:00]  Actually, if you want, I don't even know.  Sam is helping me out with this, and he could maybe tell us which one's going up today.  There's another turkey bit.  Wow.  The turkey bits were just flying, I guess.  Look at Sam running down the hall.  He can't wait to come in.  Look at those goose feet he's got.  Quack, quack, quack, quack.  Quack, quack.  Sam.  You look silly when you walk, never mind run.  What were you guys talking about while I was running?  Hold on, hold on.  What were we talking about?  Sam.  Yeah. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah, you're helping me out with these tapes because it's going from VHS to DVD.  Yeah, we're digitizing.  Yes, we are.  Now, what's the next bit?  I think we'll stay on the turkey theme because a lot of people want to know what else can  they do with a turkey.  What else?  You know something?  Are you embarrassed to see that?  Yes.  Like it makes you really uncomfortable?  Oh, my God, Opie.  Yeah.  You're choking.  Over the top.  I'm not.  Badness.  No, that was great.  You're playing charades and all of a sudden your friend's sick. 
[04:00:00]  How are you supposed to know?  No, see, he gets sick first.  Oh.  And I see him choking and I go, oh, my God.  And people think I'm going to say, Opie's choking, but I go, let's see he wants to play  charades.  Oh, Anthony.  Because he's doing the universal sign for choking and I'm like, it's just such a party.  But then wouldn't charades be over because that's an obvious one, the choking?  Yeah, yeah.  We suck.  And by the way, who starts charades without saying a word?  You say, let's play charades, everybody.  You don't just begin clutching your throat and all of a sudden charades has commenced. 
[04:00:30]  That would be problem number 835 with that whole clip, an idea behind it.  Well, the problem is, for real, that I saved all these.  You don't have one copy of our Real Rock TV shows, right?  Exactly.  I got every single one of them.  Like Lucas doesn't have a copy of the Christmas, Star Wars Christmas special.  And there's good reason for it.  They're great copies because I didn't even tape them off the TV. 
[04:01:00]  This is right off the master, my friend.  Oh, was it off the master?  Oh, yeah.  This is good quality shit.  It is very good quality.  These actually aired?  Yes.  Oh, these were on the Spanish television channel up there.  We were big TV stars, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Big TV stars.  Every week.  It was WAF, Real Rock TV.  Can we hear it again, though?  No.  I don't think we described it accurately to people as we're going.  No.  No.  All right.  Look at Jimmy.  I don't know what happens.  I think I just black out. 
[04:01:30]  And instead of feeling uncomfortable, I just kind of like openly laugh and laugh at myself.  Yeah.  Jimmy, we'll play it again if you describe what's going on.  Yeah, of course I have to because it's a very funny bit, but it's visual.  Yeah.  So the people can't see what's happening.  All right.  There we go.  We're all at the table.  Laughing, having fun.  The guy's doing the Charlie Chaplin roll.  Yeah.  It's terrific.  Ope's choking.  Well, I had to sell it.  That looked like a big piece of turkey going in my mouth. 
[04:02:00]  But I never even had any kidneys.  And throwing a punchline to a fine joke.  Yes.  Everyone loves it.  Everybody's killing.  Ope begins choking.  I laughed so far.  I was actually nervous the first time I saw it.  I'm like, he's choking.  Anthony jumps up.  First words.  First words.  Now Ope is really choking.  He's standing up, holding his neck.  Wait, wait.  What's the love of the cuckoo's there?  No.  He's choking.  Why?  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Choking your time link.  Heimlich. 
[04:02:30]  Heimlich.  Someone goes Heimlich.  Anthony runs behind him.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, now there's the pan.  And the turkey just flies in it.  Yes.  The whole carcass.  Yes.  The whole thing.  And then Prince Valiant is okay.  Who was that youth?  Jesus.  Oh, were we so young?  Yes, you were.  I don't know what happened.  And the great part of this, by the way, is the good editing, like Ed Wood would do.  You see in the beginning of the clip, O putting a sliver of turkey into his mouth.  And at the end, you see the entire bird carcass flying.  A turkey might grow out of a sliver. 
[04:03:00]  It's very possible he was eating the last part of the giant piece of turkey.  Now, my hair is horrendous, first of all.  Well, what's wrong with your hair?  The part that really got my girl, by the way, was at the end of the video, I take my fingers  and put my hair behind my ear.  Yes.  She goes, that's what a girl would do.  Exactly.  And then she actually got out of bed and said, I'm watching TV in the living room.  She left the bedroom.  And that's the last I've heard of my girl.  Oh.  She hates when I put this stuff up. 
[04:03:30]  That is really.  That's one of many, Ed.  I can't wait.  What's today's clip?  It's another turkey theme.  Yeah.  And we're going to stick with the turkeys because later on this afternoon.  Yeah.  We're all going turkey bowling.  Oh, God.  No, we're not.  Do you remember in the bar?  Yeah.  That I remember.  Do you got the guy, like, blowing the flame?  I remember that now.  Who's the flame? 
[04:04:00]  Bartender tried to be cool and, you know, blow the vodka and light it.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  You know what the clip also reminded me of?  A little peripheral thing.  Those halogen lights that were all over the place.  Oh, shit.  Remember that?  It was these halogen lights that got up to, like, a thousand degrees.  And the bulb was exposed.  Well, they were saucers.  It was like in a saucer.  It was like in a bowl.  Yeah.  The light fixture part was a bowl.  And inside, it was on a stand that was about five feet tall or so. 
[04:04:30]  And inside was this halogen bulb.  And these things have since been outlawed, I believe.  Because Opie would just roll up paper and, like a basketball, try to shoot it into the ball.  Behind Anthony.  Behind me.  Live on the air.  Yeah, on the air.  And they would just burst into flames behind me.  And I'd be like, you smell something?  Ah!  It would be burning.  I'd have to unplug the light, tip it over, get the fire out of it, and stomp it out. 
[04:05:00]  It got to be like Yosemite Sam with Bugs Bunny throwing the match down in the gunpowder room on the ship.  If you do that again, I'm not going to get it.  There is another clip coming up a little later on, probably this week.  Well, it's one a day.  Right.  I could put five up easy, but I'm going to spread this stuff out so you guys really enjoy it.  Oh, it's best to, because you have to savor each one with numerous plays.  You have to watch it a few times to get the whole thing.  Yes, Jimmy. 
[04:05:30]  Today is fucking Tuesday.  I want my Tuesday clip.  That's Monday's clip.  I want Tuesday's clip, too.  You'll get Tuesday's clip, I guess.  After the show.  After the show.  No.  After the show.  No.  I want Tuesday's clip now.  There's got to be one clip a day in the morning.  And this way, because otherwise, you're always yesterday's clip, today's clip.  I want to put a clip up after every radio show, and then people enjoy it until the next live radio show.  And then they could call and discuss it. 
[04:06:00]  Deuce Chiller is pointing out something here.  He's saying, I love that once Opie's on camera, he can't stop looking into it.  Hey, it was our first shot of TV.  Oh, that's fantastic.  But I think if you post them in the morning, and we talk about the clip, that will get views up,  because people will have heard the description, and they'll have to go, oh, this is what's going on.  Will it ever.  All right, you're right.  This is Tuesday's clip, then.  That's Monday's clip.  I want Tuesday's clip.  That means we don't have to put a clip up today.  You're absolutely right.  No, I want a second clip. 
[04:06:30]  Later today.  I want a second clip.  I want it now.  That's why I'm spreading this out, because people are begging to see more Deuce Chiller Theater.  Wait until they see you guys driving.  What's that one about?  Oh, well, they let you guys kind of host a show.  Like, you know, you'd throw it to different things, but you guys were driving.  Because we were so good at TV that we could do it from my car.  Wait, what is this?  Opie was behind the wheel.  Got a little rebellious.  What did he do? 
[04:07:00]  This is so mad.  Come on, I can't even.  You can do it away.  Okay.  Well, they were driving down the road, and Opie said, hey, you want to see me run this red light?  And then he pointed the camera up and slowly drove past a red light.  I must have been going at least 10 miles an hour, Ant.  Wow.  Look out.  You're dangerous.  Yeah.  Thank God there was another clip to go to, because then Opie turned to Anthony and said, oh, my God, is that a cop behind us? 
[04:07:30]  Quick, turn the camera off.  Turn the camera off.  Yeah, and was it shut off?  Yeah, before we saw any police officers.  Oh, look.  No money for extras in the budget.  Extras.  This was on a Spanish-speaking TV station.  So, wait, he's driving 10 miles an hour, allegedly through a red light.  He rolls through a red light.  Yeah, of course.  It's a California stop, as they call it.  And he turned the camera off.  Why?  Then what happens?  Well, he said there was a cop. 
[04:08:00]  He looked in the rearview mirror, but the camera did not go to the rearview mirror.  Sure, why would it?  And then noticed that he believed there was a cop hot on his tail.  So he turned the camera off.  Right.  Why?  To avoid the one thing that would have been entertaining?  Which is the police.  Oh, how embarrassing.  Oh, this look back is going to be good.  Fantastic.  One clip a day.  Very excited.  Today, you enjoy the Opie chokes on a turkey bit.  How is Ants acting?  Well, you saw it here playing charade. 
[04:08:30]  Believe it or not, he didn't realize.  That was scripted.  So, I mean, Ants acting is very good.  Someone is saying, you can tell Ants acting because he had no idea what to do with his  hands.  I knew what to do with my hands.  You grab your neck.  Yeah.  Right.  You should have actually squeezed until you choked yourself.  Then there wouldn't have been any more clips to make.  Anthony knew what he was doing.  Your hands were not in front of you.  You were like, charades.  He's choking now.  Charades.  You know the big...  You know Mr. Fabasham?  You know what the big get is going to be? 
[04:09:00]  What?  The Tickle Me Elmo bit.  I can't find it yet.  Wow.  I've been going through a lot of tapes trying to find it.  You best find that one because what a moment in radio history that was.  Didn't we have Tickle Me Elmo actually drive in a car?  Whoa.  Oh, did we do that?  Why?  Oh, he probably wouldn't be a very good driver.  Well, I think the camera had to be shut off because a cop was behind him.  Well, I can tell you this much.  The Tickle Me Elmo, we wanted to kill the Tickle Me Elmo. 
[04:09:30]  And Tickle Me Elmo was driving.  I do believe we tried to take him out in a drive-by.  Oh, no, that one?  You remember that?  And then, you know, in the end, we got him.  The big finale was...  Yeah.  But I forgot there was a whole story behind...  We couldn't just do the grand finale.  I think we interviewed...  We needed a build-up.  I think we interviewed Tickle Me Elmo, too.  He was sitting on a little couch next to him.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm freezing.  I can't take this. 
[04:10:00]  Because it's...  I'm remembering this.  I love...  I blanked all this out.  People know I love my Twitter.  I haven't checked a reply since that clip went up.  I can't do it to myself.  No one liked Tickle Me Elmo.  You guys killed him.  I remember a little Tickle Me Elmo in the driver's seat as a car passed by.  Which car was it, by the way?  I think we used yours on that one.  Was it?  Because you had the cool, like, car.  I think you had the...  I had a real guinea mobile. 
[04:10:30]  Yeah.  What did I have?  The, like, freaking cougar.  Yeah.  It was a 1997 cougar.  Black, of course, with the tinted windows because I'm a Dago.  Let me go to the phones.  Oh, God damn.  Let me go to the phones because someone has a fine comment here.  Hello.  I'm being in for this show.  Mikey.  OB.  Yeah.  Morning.  Morning.  You guys should call this bit Two Douches, One Clip. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  The stars are going down.  I thought I had a five-star video, Sam.  What happened?  What's going on?  Some people not rating it five stars?  Got to keep it five stars.  Come on.  That happened.  You know what?  If it's not a five-star video, then this all goes away.  That's what I do.  Oh, my God.  You can't.  You can't.  See what I do?  See?  No.  If you want to see more douche-chill clips, then you better make this five stars.  Wow, that was tough. 
[04:11:30]  That's tough.  And just remembering some of these, I don't want to see them, but I am compelled.  We're very different in that way, too, because I had a problem.  I'm like, man, Ann's going to hate me because he doesn't like seeing this shit.  No, no, no.  You know what?  I like seeing it for just throwing myself under the bus or us under the bus.  I'll watch it 50 times.  It's just that first time where I'm like, I got to put my hands in front of my face like  I'm watching in the ring again for the first time.  But then after a while, you can just watch the movie over and over. 
[04:12:00]  It's not as scary anymore.  That's how this is.  I haven't seen it yet, but do you remember some kind of bit we did with toy cars and  drunk driving in the parking lot?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't remember.  I forgot why we were doing this.  It must have been a big news story, but we did a whole drunk driving using like-  Matchbox cars?  Yeah, little matchbox cars or something.  With girls flying out of the vehicle.  I'm like, they let us put this on TV up there? 
[04:12:30]  Who said that was good?  Like, who went, yeah, that's good.  My dream is that-  By the way, our stuff was 20 times better than Rocco's for the morning show stuff, which  is really saying a lot.  That's what we got to do.  You got to find me one good Rocco bit.  You know what I mean by good.  I was watching Rocco's interview with L7 yesterday.  Was that good?  How was that?  Yeah, yeah.  So, L7, we're here with L7, dude. 
[04:13:00]  We're going on stage with a cigarette because it'll look cooler.  Hey, Rocco.  No, no.  And that's the worst.  The worst.  What the fuck is it with you?  Of O.P. and Anthony.  Are you professional or not?  Listen to O.P. and Anthony live at Uncensored.  Weekday mornings from 6 to 11 a.m.  Oh, good for you.  The virus.  Sirius 197.  197.  XM.  XM.  202.  Fuck's sake, man, you're amateur. </pre>
