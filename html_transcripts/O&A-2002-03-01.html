<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a chaotic account of a dramatic confrontation and subsequent reconciliation with their boss, Ken.  Ken, unexpectedly arriving in New York with luggage, unleashed a furious outburst, initially quitting before emotionally retracting his resignation, admitting he had nowhere else to go. This scene was punctuated by intense anger, comedic descriptions of Ken's luggage, and the use of ethnic slurs.  Simultaneously, the hosts recounted their previous night's exploits at Hooters with Stephanie, the "Naughty Nighty" contest winner, who was present in the studio, nearly nude, and posing for pictures for the show's website.  They detailed Stephanie readily flashing patrons and recounted a vulgar and offensive encounter with co-host Norton, who made inappropriate comments to fans and defaced pictures of Stephanie while signing autographs.

The show featured a call from comedian Pablo Francisco promoting his Cleveland Improv shows, but quickly shifted back to sexually explicit commentary and banter surrounding Stephanie's posing for the website.  Technical difficulties with the webcam provided further comedic fodder, alongside discussion of Stephanie's ethnicity based on her appearance.  The hosts also engaged in a lengthy, aggressive, and highly profane rebuttal to a negative *Sacramento Magazine* article by Michael O'Brien criticizing their crude humor and its potential negative influence on young people, specifically mentioning his 13-year-old daughter.  Their response was filled with insults and counter-arguments, targeting O'Brien's perceived hypocrisy and parenting style.

Further segments included giving increasingly convoluted and comedically misdirecting driving directions to a lost listener, Kelly, navigating Manhattan,  making jokes about the possibility of a homeless person harming her.  The show also featured the "FU Line," listener-submitted angry messages; a discussion about a listener's supermarket checkout lane experience; an "unlucky lottery" segment highlighting the ironic death of a man who survived a train disaster only to be killed days later by another train; and continued interaction with callers, often with sexually suggestive or offensive comments.  The hosts boasted about their past success in destroying their former stations, BCN and AAF, and their antagonistic relationship with AAF's program director, Dave Dickless, using highly offensive language to taunt him and playing audio clips of themselves badmouthing BCN. They also mocked a phone call from Dickless attempting to stop their "gay humor."

The show included a call from Tracy, the "curdled milk girl," who repeatedly postponed her appearance; extensive, offensive commentary on Richard Nixonâ€™s White House tapes filled with racist, anti-Semitic, and misogynistic comments; and playful teasing of guest Paul Mercurio, a writer for *The Daily Show*, about his Emmy award, even drinking from it.  Paul Mercurio's presence in the studio was mentioned in multiple segments.  The show also included discussion of an upcoming "55-gallon drum challenge" with women and various forms of torture, interactions with Tom from New Orleans, who consistently demonstrated incompetence and mishaps related to the show's promotions and broadcasts,  and a description of a dumpster-diving contest featuring Kelly.  This dumpster diving segment also included commentary on Kelly's underwear, frustration over a poorly written Premier Mitsubishi radio advertisement by Tom (who was increasingly intoxicated throughout the segment), an angry phone call from a woman in a parking lot after Tom's insensitive remarks, and a caller recounting an experiment where exposing his niece and nephew to the show resulted in negative behaviors. The show concluded with more banter, promotion for upcoming events and segments (including the 55-gallon drum challenge), a John Madden impression, and mention of Norton performing at Town Hall and Paul Mercurio at the Gotham Comedy Club.  Listener anticipation of a future road show involving lamb blood, pastries, and potentially inappropriate activities with contest winners was also discussed.  An HBO's "Real Sex" episode featuring older couples in awkward sexual encounters was also referenced.  Finally, the show played several more "F U" messages from listeners.

[00:01:00]  What the hell, it's Friday!  Woo!  People wanna have fun today, Anthony!  Yeah, at least we've had a half an hour to wind down!  That's nice!  10-6 a-nighter! 10-6 a-nighter! We got whores on the city!  We need backup now!  I don't care how many Dago, guinea, walk, greets, ball, goombas, come out of the woodwork!  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk, McBrenn!  I love that guy!  Play the other one!  That was this one! 
[00:01:30]  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world!  Why are you saving your best clip?  Which one?  You know!  Because I don't have it!  I told Rick, he said he can't find it on his computer!  You can act like a man!  That's the one I want!  You can act like a man!  I gave it to you!  It was on my desktop!  See, now you're doing it wrong!  Well, that's why...  You could act like a man! 
[00:02:00]  Let me in!  Are there babes in there?  Yeah!  Then let me in!  See, I do walking!  I do walking!  You like movies about gladiators!  Then let me in!  Alright, a couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, give us a call if you're outside of New York.  Use this number, 866-277-4WOW. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah!  I think our boss quit today, but I'm not sure.  Do we have?  I think we worked things out, but I'm not really sure.  Did he quit, or did we work things out?  I think both.  Both at the same time happened?  I gotta tell you, I've never, ever seen him as pissed off as he was today.  Oh my God!  He was mad on the phone yesterday, but today, oh man.  I stayed in the city last night. 
[00:03:00]  Well, we did the Hooters thing last night.  Yeah.  We're gonna talk about that in a little bit here, but...  So I stayed in, you know, and I get a call at like 1230.  And I'm right, I'm two blocks away.  You know, usually I'm home, or on my way in.  It's Jeremy.  He goes, um, Ken's made a special trip to New York.  He wasn't supposed to be here today.  To meet with you guys, to have a meeting.  I was like, um...  Oh, okay, I'll be in in 10 minutes.  I'm right around the corner.  Is Opie there?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Um...  It's not gonna be a yelling meeting. 
[00:03:30]  I was like, oh, okay, that's good.  Eh, wrong!  Drag in, dumbass!  Liar!  It was civil for about three seconds.  But then I think, uh...  I think we got some things accomplished.  Yeah.  At one point, he picked up luggage and sent them out of here.  Slammed the table.  Why did he have luggage?  The effort...  I swear to God, it was Ken Stevens in the Deaf Comedy Jam.  He was cursing, like... 
[00:04:00]  Slammed his hand on the table.  That's it!  I quit!  He left.  And we're sitting there going, wait a minute.  And we're just...  The boss doesn't quit!  You fire us!  He can't just leave!  I was upset when he said...  I have tape of what he said to me, and I was a little offended.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, Watton, Greaseball, Goombas come out of the woodwork.  And then he addressed Opie.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk McFriend.  I've never been more uncomfortable in my life. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, my God!  And I love being uncomfortable.  I think we know that by now, but, uh...  So, Ken was storming out, and he...  But the best part, though, there's always...  There was a little humor involved with his, uh, quitting.  Why?  Because he was carrying luggage!  He was leaving.  And it was, like, a lot of luggage.  Because you know he wanted to use his hands to make his point.  But he couldn't, because he was holding heavy luggage!  He made a special trip to come to New York, so he had his luggage with him.  He came right from the airport.  And, uh, man, when he passed by, uh, Ben. 
[00:05:00]  Ben came in, like, what?  What happened?  He had this shell-shocked look on his face.  We're like, I don't know.  He goes, I went to hold the door for Ken, but he looked too pissed off.  He looked too pissed to want to hold the door for him?  Actually, I didn't need to hold it.  He ripped it off the hinges as he left.  And then, uh, oof.  He grabbed his luggage, and then we're just sitting in his offices going, uh, now what?  Now what do we do?  And then I'm starting to think, I think we're really running the place now. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  He...  Someone's suggesting we should play bang on the drum all day  and let him go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!  To get it out of his system.  The crazy bang, bang, Friday bit.  So then, um...  And then he had to awkwardly walk back in with his really heavy luggage.  Yeah.  So we could sort some things out.  You know, I don't know why he was coming back.  I think he was coming back till I get something.  And then we just happened to still be in his office,  because we were shell-shocked, and we didn't know what to do.  Shell-shocked. 
[00:06:00]  And, uh...  Yeah, then we had to sit down for a little longer.  Kind of hash it out after.  Hash some things out.  After some, uh...  And then after lunch, we go back into his office, and he wasn't there.  His luggage was on the couch that the couple had the anal on.  Uh-huh.  That couch is still in there for whatever reason.  Yeah.  They got rid of that.  I guess he likes to be reminded of it or something.  I don't know.  And then, uh...  And then there was, like, kind of, um, a cutout in his glass.  It was a Ken Stevens-shaped, uh, break through the glass in the office.  In his window on the ninth floor. 
[00:06:30]  I think he jumped.  I'm not really sure.  Oh, my God.  He's either, uh, safely on a train somewhere, or he's splattered outside the Brooklyn Diner right now.  I have never seen him that mad in my life.  That rivaled how pissed off Dave Dickless was at AAF up in Massachusetts when he got all pissed off about the pie-throwing thing after the mayor incident. 
[00:07:00]  He was so mad, but that rivals that.  He got explained really fast.  He wanted to...  Yeah, we said the mayor was dead.  I think everybody pretty much knows that story up in Boston.  And, uh, his great idea was that we, to patch things over with the mayor, was that we would get in the, uh, old-fashioned stocks where you put your head and your arms through it, like the old New England days.  And, uh, the mayor would throw pies at our face.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ho, ho!  Yeah.  And then when we got on the air and started talking about how there is no way in hell we're getting in stocks and letting the mayor throw pies, he called up and said, 
[00:07:30]  I arranged this thing to try to make good, to keep your jobs, and you don't go on the air saying you're not doing that!  Ha, ha, ha.  He was mommy dearest.  Oh, he was.  Ha, ha, ha.  Tina!  Clean up this mess!  Because it started off slow.  Yeah.  And built to a crescendo.  So, that was the last time any, uh, boss figure got that mad at us.  And then, oh, my God, when Ken punched the table and said he was leaving, I was like, oh, here's some trouble now. 
[00:08:00]  I think, uh, we worked something out, though.  He says, I've had it.  Ha, ha, ha.  He said, I've had it.  F you, F this, F me, F everything.  The F word flying out of his mouth.  I swear to God.  Never heard him like that.  But we, uh, worked everything.  But then he came back in, right, Ant?  He did.  He did.  We should tell the fine folks that he came back in, and, uh, I think we, uh, agreed that, uh, we need each other. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  You know what?  I think he realized going down the halls, like, what the hell is this gonna, you know.  Actually, we did, we have clips of when he did come back into the office.  As we're just sitting there in shock.  We were taping it, yeah.  We're sitting there in shock.  He came in, threw his bags down, and, uh, I believe this was what he said.  Don't you do it!  Don't!  Don't!  Don't!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go! 
[00:09:00]  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nothing else.  Wow!  Then what are you doing?  The bosses are kinda, kinda crying in front of you.  Then what are you doing?  The bosses are kind of crying in front of you.  You can't, after a statement like that.  You know.  He got in some good shots, though.  Remember when he said this?  It's not about you, douchebag. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, well.  So we're going to move on today, aren't we?  Have fun, fun, fun.  It's Friday.  I refuse to let anything get me pissed off.  Let me tell you something.  After the show yesterday, we went down to Hooters with Stephanie, who's in the studio,  the winner of the Naughty Nighty contest.  Ah, yes.  And we had a lot of fun down there.  And Stephanie, I got to tell you, what a trooper, flashing every single guy that asked.  You know something?  It wasn't even like, you know, it's like, oh, I know. 
[00:10:00]  You know some girls that do that?  They come down here, they flash, and then when we're out or doing a road show or something  or just hanging out at the bar, and someone, hey, give me a little wow or a flash.  Oh, well, I don't do.  And you got to beg and feel all stupid.  You just whip them out.  It's great, you know?  They're great looking, and she knows it, and she's not afraid to show them.  Not at all.  That was a hint, by the way.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A little hint.  Yeah, we need to be calm.  Oh, my God.  What a soothing sensation. 
[00:10:30]  If she was in the meeting that we had with Ken, I don't think there would have been much  yelling going on.  None.  Ken, you're about ready to yell.  Wait, Stephanie.  Stephanie, lift up the shirt, and then all of a sudden it's like, oh.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I forgot what the problem was.  I was mistaken.  I forgot what we were discussing.  What's wrong, Jim?  So nice.  She gets so pissed off at hot girls.  I like her.  She's really nice.  I'm not mad.  She's a very nice girl.  No, I'm not mad at her.  You just get upset and annoyed.  It just reminds you of what garbage you really are. 
[00:11:00]  Is that what it is?  Yeah, you just feel your meat breast, and you're like.  See what you do to guys sometimes?  Sorry.  Yeah.  How often are you just getting hit on?  Yeah, all the time, right?  How many of those guys hit on you last night?  A few.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are they giving you their business cards?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  With cell phone numbers and all that.  Why don't you give me a call?  I think I could further your career.  Or something with your rear.  Well, we've got to thank everyone that went to Hooters last night. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  We had a ball.  Yeah, it was great.  It was a nice crowd, man.  Yeah, and a really good time.  Everyone was pretty cool, except Norton.  My throat, chest, and I am hurting from laughing so hard sitting next to Norton.  The guy has no mercy.  He's got no conscience.  He just, you were ruthless.  The people will come up and want to get an autograph.  You know, sign a sticker.  We had beautiful pictures of Stephanie that people were grabbing and having us. 
[00:12:00]  And Norton is right to my left.  People are coming up from my right across the table.  And they go, hey, could you sign this?  Man, I love the show.  Whatever.  And the music was pretty loud.  So I could barely hear what the person was saying.  And they could barely hear what I'm saying.  But we're having a conversation over the music.  And then you do a few nods, like you make believe you can hear, type of thing, right?  Norton is just far enough away from our conversation where the guy can't quite hear what he's saying.  And he's saying the most offensive, rude, heinous things. 
[00:12:30]  Now, I hear what he's saying.  But the person doesn't hear.  So I'm talking to the guy going, yeah, no, that's really cool.  And somebody will be conveying a little story about, you know, they were listening to the show.  And Norton's just like, oh, shut up, you effing dick.  And just kill yourself.  He's making racial remarks.  Like anything he could nail someone with.  And to top it off, people go, hey, Norton, I love you.  And he's like, oh, thanks, thanks.  After he just berated the guy.  But the guy can't hear that he was being berated.  The only one that could hear was you. 
[00:13:00]  It was me, so I'm dying laughing, but looking like an idiot.  Norton was pretty much doing it for your benefit.  And then he, somebody will ask to sign something.  He'll put it down in front of Norton and maybe kind of look away or something.  Norton writes, I, and then heart, you know, like love.  He goes, I, heart, C, O, and then C, and then the other letter.  He's just writing how he loves it.  All over the picture of Stephanie.  All over, yeah.  And then that was another thing.  Like, everyone loved the picture of Stephanie. 
[00:13:30]  And me and Obie were signing around the picture of her so you get the whole picture.  Right.  Norton grabs it, turns it sideways because she's standing up.  Starts in her face, ends in her toes, and signs his name over her whole body.  And the person just leaves all pissed off and dejected.  And you ruin the picture.  Half those people went and got back on the end of the line.  Yeah, you got a new picture.  And didn't let you sign it that time.  He just started her face and signed it down her whole body and destroyed the picture.  Yeah.  Which is, again, not a reflection on Stephanie.  She's a nice girl. 
[00:14:00]  But just the fact that they were going to go home and look at her.  Oh, man, that's dick.  You signed right over there.  And then he's like, all right, step up here, hot C.  And he's calling guys hot C-O.  But they couldn't hear it.  No, they can't hear it.  It's like, ha, ha, step up here, hot C.  He's like, yeah, can I suck your C?  He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, man.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like, yeah, yeah, man.  He's like, oh, thanks.  And I'm hearing the whole thing, so I'm crying.  I was crying.  I said, look, there's seven guys.  They gave us a wow sticker, and it's really loud.  I'm like, let me suck your C.  And he's like, oh, okay.  It's all right.  Sign it.  And he'd write, there's a black guy comes up, and Norton writes on his thing, nice big 
[00:14:30]  black C.  And he gives the thing back to the guy, and the guy goes, thanks, man, and walks away.  Like, later on, he's going to be looking at it and go, what the, who wrote that?  Classic.  Norton.  Classic.  Yeah, it was fun, man.  I was just goofing on people.  Everybody was really cool, though.  You know what?  It really felt good to be out in New York.  That's the first time in a really long time for us.  Yeah.  And I, you know, and I got to announce it right now. 
[00:15:00]  I'm itching for a road show.  Yeah.  Last night really got me.  The road shows were getting a little, you know, a little too much.  We felt like, you know, we needed to take a break from the road show.  Mm-hmm.  I'm itching.  I think we need to do one.  Sooner than later, my friend.  Yes.  Got a lot of new things to introduce to find listeners, too.  Imagine a packed club and we're spraying a chick down with lamb blood out of a super soaker.  Well, that would be a highlight.  We got Frenchie and other things. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, you could have, maybe we could have something where you throw pastries at them.  Ho-ho.  Put them in stocks.  Maybe we could, maybe we could bring our blind boxing to a road show or our one-legged boxing.  Yeah.  That'd be fun.  A lot of little things.  Plenty of things.  I'm starting to itch.  I'm starting to think about it.  What do you think, Ant?  Kick the cane out of, away from Patty game.  We could do that.  That would, like, feel done again.  You know what?  New York hasn't seen Stark and Patty in the Supergirl outfit.  Oh.  With her lame cancer haircut. 
[00:16:00]  And now her new gimpy leg.  Dude, what's that great thing that they should, the thing that you were talking about doing  at the road show where Norton has anal with the contest winner?  Oh, is that the one?  How do you feel about that, Stephanie?  Yeah.  I feel about that one.  Yeah, think about it.  You know what I'm thinking?  A roofie or two, you won't even know.  Wake up crying.  We're all laughing.  I'll laugh.  Too ashamed to call the cops, you know.  It was my fault. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, it was.  Oh, God.  Should have locked your window.  That's good for us.  I think we got a road show.  Yeah.  Coming up soon.  Yeah, we'll do that.  We'll get that together.  With us and the listeners, we'll build a road show.  Yeah.  This time around, we build.  We build one.  Piece by piece.  Yeah, we kind of throw it out there.  What do you guys want to see this time around?  Bit by bit.  I mean, obviously, we got to do the blood thing.  Yeah.  That's great.  That's a no-brainer.  What else do you guys want to see at a road show? 
[00:17:00]  And we'll go from there.  Nice.  And we'll book it.  Get back out there.  Stephanie went to gay night after Hooters.  Not intentionally.  Where?  The spa.  This is...  We don't go to the spa and...  Yeah.  It ended up being gay night.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A lot of guys.  Have fun.  Ooh!  That's actually a better night, though, for you and your boyfriend to go, because you're  not going to get hit on the whole night.  You guys can hang.  Yeah, he was sweating.  Yeah, he was a little freaked to talk to him before the show.  Gay night. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This was the first time you came to New York City, right?  Yes, it is.  Oh, boy.  So, after Hooters, you guys...  Did you make it down to Privilege?  Yes, we went to Privilege.  Oh, how did they treat you?  It was nice.  Yeah, nice.  Yeah.  You got some lap dances?  No, I didn't.  No?  Why not?  The chicks love going on the chicks for the lap dance.  They love that.  And I think Stephanie would have enjoyed the lap dance, right?  Might have.  Might have.  Yeah.  When are you leaving for Washington?  A few minutes, or about a minute.  Yeah, you got to go, huh?  We could get a girl up here like that to give you a lap dance. 
[00:18:00]  You think so?  How hot would that be?  Yeah.  Harry, when are you leaving?  Round four.  I'm going to try to get out of here.  Oh, my God.  We need someone to help us out big time.  One of the girls from one of the clubs.  One of the girls from one of the clubs.  You know who you are.  If you want to give the lovely Stephanie a lap dance before she leaves at four, so she has  a good memory of New York City, that would be great.  Right.  A big help.  So, then you went to spa.  It was gay night?  Yeah.  Did you see some of the gayness, or...?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Two guys grinding on each other and making out.  It's just not what I wanted to see. 
[00:18:30]  You don't see that in Washington?  No.  Girls, they're okay.  And you guys do anything today?  No.  We were walking around.  Went to Times Square.  That was fun.  All right.  Times Square.  Yeah.  Very touristy.  Yeah.  All right.  Gay night.  You know what I saw the other night on HBO?  That just...  We've talked about this in the past.  Chris, folks.  Now, that's Showtime.  I don't know how to stop it. 
[00:19:00]  I was watching one of the HBO real sex episodes.  I love the real sex episodes.  And it was one of the things we talk about on this show all the time.  It's the funniest goddamn thing.  When they bring a group of people together...  To get naked.  To get naked and talk about...  Was it the mud one?  No.  It was the tantric sex one.  Oh, yeah.  It's always some slob woman that is an authority and gets these dumb couples together to teach  them about this certain whatever type of sex it is.  This time it was tantric sex. 
[00:19:30]  You know the sex that's supposed to last for hours and hours and hours and hours.  And the funniest thing was they have this old guy.  This guy's like well into his 50s.  He's a businessman and he's wearing his little glasses.  He's completely naked with his aging woman.  And he's like, yes, I'm a CEO at a very successful corporation.  And his yam bag is down to his kneecaps.  And I'm just thinking, what guy can now walk into his company after he's been on HBO with 
[00:20:00]  his gray yam bag hanging down to his knees?  I don't think that HBO is going to catch on.  I don't think he has anything to worry about.  You think it was one of those things where no one's going to see this.  It's a stupid little thing.  It's very freeing for me.  Right.  As a matter of fact.  And then they have him and he's interacting with the guys like they're giving each other  these massages.  So he's laying on his stomach and there's some old broad behind him pushing in his ass  cheeks like she's pushing hard and leading like. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, like like push starting at the thighs, pushing up like over the ass and then onto  the back and laying.  Yeah, that's what he looked like and laying down on top of him and then going back and  forth.  And she's got her eyes shut and she's like and they all got a moan.  It's disgusting.  This old guy is sitting there and every time she like got to his butt and pushed the CEO  where this company is going, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm looking like oh. 
[00:21:00]  And then there's the they're not even like the young hot couple.  They're just like, I guess the best out of the bunch.  and all the guys want to have an interaction with his girl.  They're out in the woods,  because for some reason you've got to bring naked old people out into the woods 
[00:21:30]  for this freeing experience.  They're standing in a line front to back with each other.  Front to back.  And some of the guys are up against guys.  And they're doing this wave thing.  You could be more comfortable about your sexuality.  That's what it is.  It doesn't matter if a man's junk is in my crack.  I'm secure with my masculinity.  Yeah, but what if you don't have a guy behind you?  That's not right either.  What? 
[00:22:00]  Nothing.  Oh.  And they're doing this wave thing.  Like, say you're standing in a line,  and you're front to back with a bunch of people,  and then you move your arms forward.  And as you do that, you all arch your back.  And then you move your arms back, and you bend forward.  So they're, in essence, humping each other in this big, long line of people that are like,  well, I'm a CEO of a corporation.  Then you have the other, you know, the hippie.  We sell herbs in a small herb shop. 
[00:22:30]  I'm a history teacher.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a high school math teacher, and I, me and my wife thought, you know,  we've had many sexual experiences, but we thought this would enlighten our sexuality.  Who's going to, who's going to let their kid go to this guy's class?  Yeah.  To be honest with you, I probably would.  Really?  Yeah.  And now, okay, for the best of, here's another lesson for tantric sex.  Run around in the woods naked, and all the men just play grab-ass with each other.  Just play grab-ass.  Do you think this woman just stands there and goes, 
[00:23:00]  I can't believe I'm getting these people to do this?  The best one was that we've talked about many times in the show, the retreat.  All men.  No, no, no, no.  They go as couples.  But then they want each side to learn about their sexuality,  and be a little more comfortable with their sexuality.  So they put the guys over here and the girls over here,  and the girls have this just crazy orgy, remember?  They're all, like, touching each other and stuff.  And giving each other the ohs.  Now, that's hot, right?  Well, there's another side of this.  The guys are in the middle of the woods in one big naked hug. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  They're all piled on each other, hugging and humming.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  And you're watching, like, who the hell is doing this?  They're in the mud.  They're playing.  They're, like, I remember there's two guys.  The mud one's hilarious, too.  But in that one, it was all the couples jumping into a big, huge mud pit,  and then they kind of had...  They're rubbing mud on each other.  Yeah.  It was almost an orgy, but it was just they're rubbing mud on everyone. 
[00:24:00]  Chilly dog.  Yeah.  Chilly dog.  That real sex is hilarious.  It is so funny.  And you watch it going, who in the hell agreed to do this?  I can understand if you're a porn star or someone that just doesn't care.  But these are people like, yeah, I'm a teacher.  I work in the financial district down there.  Who's not going to, the next day, say, hey, I saw you on real sex. 
[00:24:30]  Great job.  Saw your yam bag.  Yeah.  Saw that guy plowing your chick.  Yeah.  It was great.  You know, and when they had those, like, where they all get naked in a room  with the old lady kind of explaining things.  Yeah.  They always gravitate to the one hot chick.  Yeah.  Well, most of them.  They all start off kind of polite, like, okay, well, I'll touch this one a little bit.  And then they all discover, wow, there is one hot chick here.  On the same episode, they were in Denmark somewhere,  and there was a place that you go that has a bunch of different rooms. 
[00:25:00]  Some of them look like the exteriors of houses.  I saw that one?  Yeah.  And people go into these rooms.  It's like a sex palace or whatever?  Yeah.  Every room has something different on them?  It has something different.  And people go into these rooms.  One looked like the outside of a house,  and people would go in and have sex on couches or whatnot,  and other people would stand by peeping in the windows of this fake house,  jacking it as they're watching people have...  It's called Norton's house.  That was right.  That's what it was called.  Norton's home. 
[00:25:30]  I like to peep things.  Yeah, I like that, too.  Well, that's pretty cool, but you know what?  Everyone's while you watch the streets of Manhattan,  and you get a nice, you know, eyeful.  You go to that sex palace to peep in the window.  The second you bend over to look in the window,  there's a guy plowing your A.  So maybe that isn't what you're looking for.  Then there was something called...  They had, like, sex chairs hanging from the ceiling and stuff?  Yeah, everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was something called the dark room.  It was a room with no light, no cracks, no windows, nothing.  You walk in, and it was like a double door thing where you walk in and close the door 
[00:26:00]  and then open the other door so there's never light in there.  And you get in, and you don't know who's in there doing what.  All of a sudden, you're just hanging out, and your seat's being grabbed.  But you don't know who it is.  It's called Norton's Room.  That's what it is.  That's what they called it.  But the thing is, you don't know if it's a guy grabbing your jug.  That would be a great thing if, like, you knew that girls like Stephanie, maybe,  are in this room, and you walk in, it's pitch black, 
[00:26:30]  and all of a sudden you're like,  Ooh, hey, there's a fine how-do-you-do.  You know, you're getting a little.  It's never like that, though.  It's some 55-year-old woman that's trying to rediscover her sexuality or something.  Or some dumb guy with a sweater.  You know what I picture in there?  Like the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Right.  I thought it would be fun and exciting, and I hadn't had sex in a while,  and it's a rediscovering of my sexuality.  How are you?  They need love and guilt.  So I figured it was going to be fun because the dye's going, 
[00:27:00]  so I thought I'd go in there.  I'd go in the darkroom so no one could see me.  I actually, you know what?  The last time people saw me naked, I have a tail, and I was going to Tokyo.  Now, shaped like Godzilla himself.  She was the hit of Hooters last night, though.  Did you see the pants she had on?  They were stretch pants, although any pants she puts on are stretched to the limit.  They were stretched to the limit.  They were stretch pants.  She turned around and walked away from that table,  and I got a look at Marion's ass like I've never seen before. 
[00:27:30]  We've got to ask her about her limp.  She limps a little bit.  If you were carrying around that ass, your legs would limp, too.  It might be the huge pocketbook that she carries everywhere, really.  Yeah.  They're going to lean to the side a little bit.  It's just a little, like, Clay Shaw limp.  It's not like a completely horrible thing.  Yeah.  It's still my heart.  Greg, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hold on.  Yeah, for some reason, I don't like the word.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[00:28:00]  Sorry about that.  Well, we just have to change the word.  Yeah, it's the real sex self-pleasuring episode.  Kids are laughing.  That was pretty much it.  Kids.  Yeah.  Imagine five lady dies, and then five hippie old six-year-old men all sitting around.  That's what it is.  They're all, like, old hippies.  Yeah, it's the most disgusting thing.  Yeah, hippie.  There's nothing hot about it.  Yeah, it was teaching about self-pleasuring. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  So all these women are laying down on their backs, their knees up, and they're being instructed  by another old hippie woman that runs this thing, and I just wonder how much money these  people cough up for this.  Yeah.  You know?  There's probably a nice chunk of change to go to this retreat and sit around and get  in touch with your sexual side.  And they're using toys.  They're using their hands.  And all it is is a bunch of, like he said, old hippie women going, ah! 
[00:29:00]  Ah!  Ah!  You can only imagine how bad the room stank.  You couldn't pay me to be on that.  Spanky, stank, ass smell.  Wet socks.  Ah!  You're on to something today?  Yeah.  Uh, an underlying theme of the show today, uh, give us your, your bad moan.  Ah!  Your, your bad, real sex, old guy moan.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  And the guys are like, yeah, the guys are jacking. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And it's just like they're, they're getting in touch with their, uh, sexuality.  It's a room full of guys.  Just go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And the woman's like, just keep going.  Relax.  And remember, it's your sexuality.  No inhibitions.  Just go change speeds because that's, oh, oh, that's good, good, good, Jim. 
[00:30:00]  You're doing, now remember, utilize all of yourself.  Use both hands.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  You're doing a good job.  Yeah, that's good.  Don't forget that spot.  Right.  And do that.  Get in touch.  Use your whole body.  And I'm, change speeds.  Grab at the bottom.  Now, slowly go to the top.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:30:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, like they just wounded an elk.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  You ever gone hunting and you get the guy that just wounds the elk?  Look, I got a good shot and you know it's not a good shot and he hits.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  And you feel bad until you put that last slug in his head.  But they're making noises like you never see a moose make or an elk. 
[00:31:00]  It's the same thing with the guys.  Keep moving.  Okay, all of you, slow down now.  Nice, slow, steady pace.  Oh!  Increase the speed.  Now move to the top and faster, faster.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  There's the CEO from Enron.  Right.  The worst part of that is these guys don't even, this is what they like to do.  They don't like to have sex.  And you know who that guy was, Anthony? 
[00:31:30]  Who was that?  Our own Ken Steele.  Was that Ken getting in touch with him?  I got to go ahead and loosen up a little bit after my meeting.  Yeah, I think after the meeting you had with us, he's going to one of those retreats.  Yeah.  To get back to nature.  All right.  We're just getting started here today.  I'd recommend watching those, though, because they are really funny.  But the geniuses that make money at that, to get a bunch of guys to play with their mules  and pay you to teach them, grab, pull, repeat.  How hard is it to do? 
[00:32:00]  It's the first thing you learn as a kid.  No need some old broad telling me how to do it.  It's the second thing you learn.  First thing you learn is secret keeping.  Jerry, make him the uncle's knuckle disappear.  How much of the show did you watch there, buddy?  What did you do?  Take notes?  I'll tell you the truth, Jerry.  I watched the whole goddamn thing.  You watched the whole goddamn thing.  DVD.  It is so friggin' funny.  I don't, I'll be honest, man.  I don't care how gay, and I'm using gay in a different way here, how gay real sex becomes, 
[00:32:30]  I have to watch the whole goddamn thing when it's on.  It's hysterically funny, and you cannot imagine, you cannot fathom why they're doing it.  Right.  And why they need some old hippie broad to teach them how to jack.  What about watching, while we're watching it?  Ugh.  Oh.  Any moans of pleasure out of a 60-year-old man.  The other, the other real sex episode that I really enjoyed was when they went to that factory in Asia. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, the dildo factory.  The dildo factory.  That was good. I saw them making the real sex dolls the other day, too.  That's really good.  On that one, that was good.  The mold in the, and then the couple, see, we're never going to get out of this.  Well, the factory, though, where they had the old Chinese ladies, you know, painting up the...  I saw that one, yeah.  You saw that one?  Yeah.  Making it nice and pink, and...  Yeah, they were painting realistic, you know, veins and whatnot on it.  And for some reason, they have to...  God, how can I explain this on the air?  They have to do this to each...  Oh, they're twisting it. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, it's like they're playing with it.  Right.  But they ought to rough it up a little.  And then they just...  They just toss it aside into a big bin.  There's like hundreds of them in there.  Yeah.  Like, ah, just...  Like it's nothing.  Oh, quicky, Yankee, cranky.  Just throwing a guy's manhood aside.  Throw into a bin.  Those big mules should come with like a plastic hand you can put on your neck.  You know what?  We can continue after the break.  Yeah, because I got to talk about the real sex doll, and one of the customers that bought  it, it's ridiculous.  It was a couple. 
[00:34:00]  And, uh, yeah, it's...  And they propped it up and all that?  Yeah.  That one, yeah.  Having their threesome.  And there's a lot of people that want to comment about it, so if you're on hold, stay there.  Uh, Stephanie's here, the winner of the Naughty Nighty contest.  Yeah.  She's leaving for Washington in about 20 minutes.  People were calling with some of the things that, uh, Jim wrote on their Stephanie picture  last night.  I couldn't get to them, and maybe they'll call back.  Uh!  Also, is...  Is Curdled Milk Girl here?  Uh, not yet, but she's on the way.  She said she's on the way?  That's what we last heard.  Gotta drink some curdled milk. 
[00:34:30]  How long has the milk been, um, staying out?  I've been curdling for a little while.  It doesn't sound that outrageous, but it's...  What?  On the outside, when you think of a girl scooping lamb brains out of a lamb skull, that, yeah.  But you think curdled milk, all right.  I think, but when you really think about it, it is the most heinous thing you could put  in your mouth.  To put it over the top, though, we got a nice, nice big lemon that we're going to squeeze  into it.  Yeah.  That curdles it up in a second.  Does it really?  Oh, my God.  There will be lumpy, clumpy bits of, uh, white, uh, creaminess. 
[00:35:00]  And she said she'll, uh...  Somehow you don't look that disgusted at that description.  How do you have to reach him?  Get him off your back.  She said that she'll chug the curdled milk to get into the 55-gallon jump challenge.  There you go.  And I think today is pretty much the last day of qualifying because we're running out  of spots.  And I think we're going to try to do the 55-gallon jump challenge a week from today, Anthony.  Yes.  Hopefully we'll have details on that. 
[00:35:30]  Also on the way, really fast, we got to talk about Madden on, uh, you know, on Monday  night football, Paul Mercurio stopping by, uh, Pablo Francisco, uh, checking in to say  hi.  I think he's playing Cleveland.  Real funny guy.  And, uh, the story of the day, Richard Nixon wanted to nuke Vietnam.  You gotta love, uh...  That's an hour and a half of radio.  Gotta love Dick Nixon.  As we go to break, it's, uh, it's the well doggy mix that a lot of people enjoy, eh?  Use it or lose it. 
[00:36:00]  I, uh, I don't like it, so I, uh...  Well, doggy, well, doggy, well, doggy, well, doggy, yeah, doggy, yeah, doggy, yeah, doggy,  Oh, doggie. Oh, doggie. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Is that supposed to be sexy? I, uh, I'm sorry. Hey, a little doggie to you. 
[00:36:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show. Make it touch her. Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show. Stephanie, the winner of the Naughty Nighting Contest, who's been hanging with us for the last two days. She's going to be leaving in about ten minutes. She's on the stinky cam right now. 
[00:37:00]  There we go. Maybe we could get her to flash for everyone at home, Anthony.  All right. We'd have to time this. Oh, I could do it. You could do it? I get the auto-click. Click.  All right, Stephanie, you're going to have to give us a nice smile and a nice flash when Ann tells you to, all right?  Then you guys can go to OpieandAnthony.com and see Stephanie in the studio. Take a picture. It lasts longer.  Okay. Click.  All right, any time you're ready. Just show and then hold so it's a great, nice, clear shot. Hold on. 
[00:37:30]  And that is it.  That's a good shot, huh?  Hey, who's the stripper?  Nice. Very nice.  Now I've got to pop up the stinky cam to see it myself.  Where the hell is it? There it is.  Let me go through this disclaimer. 
[00:38:00]  Yes.  Wow, wait.  Yeah, we got a perfect shot.  Kelly is lost. Kelly, what's up?  Hi.  It's Opie and Anthony. We got you on the air. Where are you?  Oh, no. You got me on the air?  You're going to be on the air later, right?  Get a hold of yourself, will you?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I just passed 42nd or 44th and Vernon.  What?  I've got no idea where the hell I'm at.  44th and Vernon? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, I passed you guys' place up somehow and then I ended up trying to get back to you guys.  Get a hold of yourself, would you? It must just be a renamed avenue. Simmer down. Are you in Manhattan?  I don't know.  You don't know if you're in Manhattan?  I bet she's in Brooklyn.  I don't know where the hell I am.  Where were you coming from?  Cleveland.  Oh, okay.  Whoopsie.  Did you go over a bridge or through a tunnel?  What bridge?  It said some Queensborough lower. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, you're in Queens.  I bet you went right through.  Yeah, it's good.  You probably went right through Manhattan.  You're probably in Queens then.  Oh, great.  Because you probably went right through Manhattan.  Someone on the instant feedback, tell us where 44th and Vernon.  Vern?  Vernon?  Oh, wait.  I see a sign for 495.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  495 is either the Long Island Expressway?  Yeah, yeah.  Take that.  Queens Midtown Tunnel.  Yes, go through the Midtown Tunnel. 
[00:39:30]  Does it look like there's a big backup or earlier there was a huge backup?  I don't know.  I haven't gotten there yet.  No, that's what you do.  Wait, wait.  Make sure she knows she's going to Queens Midtown Tunnel.  Make sure she didn't go through Queens.  She might have come around.  No, no.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm saying go west and go Midtown Tunnel into New York City, into Manhattan.  Wait, she might be just over the 59th Street Bridge, though.  In New York.  She might be in Manhattan and might have come in through Queens.  Long Island City.  No, if you come from Cleveland, she's in...  Uh-huh.  No, wait.  And you end up over the Queensboro Bridge? 
[00:40:00]  I went right through the city.  I went right through the city.  She's in Long Island City right now.  Oh, I...  So now go through the Midtown Tunnel.  Okay, I have to get there first.  But is it easier for her to go back over the bridge?  No, go through the goddamn tunnel.  The old tunnel opens right there.  Hey, Kelly, what are you doing on our show today?  Um, you guys are supposed to throw me in some kind of trash bin.  Oh, you're the dumpster...  Yeah, the dumpster.  Dumpster diving chick?  Oh, boy.  Did we scout out a good, nice dumpster? 
[00:40:30]  Hey, do I go 495 East or West?  West.  West.  West.  Okay.  Go West.  West.  I can't believe you missed New York City.  How do you...  How do you fly through it?  I drove right through it.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  How are you in Manhattan and not know you're there?  Didn't you see all the big, pretty buildings?  I did know I'm there.  I passed you guys up.  The skyscrapers didn't tip you off yet?  Yes, it did.  The Empire State Building wasn't a clue?  I knew I was there.  I just missed you guys. 
[00:41:00]  You missed the biggest city in the world.  You knew you...  No, I missed your building.  Wait, you knew you missed my building.  You missed the borough of Manhattan.  Oh, come on.  She said she knew she was there.  But why did you stop?  You just kept going.  I was going to try to get back.  She panicked on us.  So she ended up going all the way down 57th, probably.  And you realized you were there?  Yeah, and then I tried to turn left to go back up.  And ended up on the 59th.  I know exactly where she went.  And then come back on 57th to look for you guys again. 
[00:41:30]  She made that left off of 57th.  That goes right on to the Queensborough Bridge.  Yeah, and ended up going over there.  And now you're stuck on the bridge.  No, I'm stuck somewhere that is not a pretty city.  No, Long Island City is...  No, very industrial over there.  There's a lot of things going on.  No, I passed some housing development.  Oh, my God.  Oh, well, just don't stop.  Yeah.  You could probably pick up a hooker in that area if you're...  Yeah.  All right.  You can actually on 10th Avenue here in Manhattan, too, in the 40s.  Yeah, there you go. 
[00:42:00]  Actually, we have audio of somebody that she stopped and asked for directions.  Oh, no, no, you don't.  I'm calling you ladies.  Interesting.  Can you find your way back to the bridge, or are you just going to go to the tunnel?  Tunnel.  The tunnel.  I'm going through the Midtown Tunnel.  Yeah, there you go.  It's 350.  Now, have her go through the tunnel.  All right.  You got the 350 toll?  Yeah, I do.  Are you on your way to the tunnel at this point?  I think so.  Are you on 495 heading west?  No. 
[00:42:30]  Not yet.  Oh, boy.  Well, do you follow the signs for it?  Yeah.  So, what are you doing?  I'm working my way there.  Okay.  All right.  How do you pass Manhattan?  I cannot even figure out how.  I don't get it.  It's an island with just...  I didn't pass it.  I drove right through it.  How do you plow through Manhattan and go, oh, my God, I wasn't paying attention.  Oh, wait.  Maybe that was it.  I missed the biggest city.  I missed it.  I missed a city that has a landmark building that everyone in the world knows, the Empire State 
[00:43:00]  Building.  But you're not in the Empire State Building.  Yeah, but you can see...  You know it that you're in Manhattan when you see the building.  What, did you think?  You would drive east until you hit water and a sign saying, here's the O&A show?  Exactly.  That's exactly what I thought.  It really is impossible to pass where it has.  To be seventh, it goes from one end to the other.  It's an island that just has thousands of skyscrapers.  And if you cross over water...  All right, I don't receive a sign for $4.95 east now.  West.  West.  Okay, I'm still looking for it. 
[00:43:30]  All right, you know what?  We should punish her and send her to Harlem right now.  No, don't do that.  Let's make...  Let's send her uptown.  Yeah.  This is bad enough.  Yeah, she's all afraid.  No, I don't want to go that way.  Our studio is right next to the Apollo Theater.  125th and Broadway.  I think our studio...  495 West.  Oh, damn it.  Okay.  Yeah, you go up to 125th and you ask where the spook building is.  Oh, God.  Oh, okay.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with you?  What?  Just trying to get her... 
[00:44:00]  Well, 495 is on 50th?  Right?  No, just take...  No, no.  Forget 50th.  It doesn't exist.  Take 495 to the big hole.  You pay the toll.  You go through the big hole and it magically puts you back in Manhattan.  Then you'll be back in Manhattan.  Then you'll be around 1st or 2nd Avenue.  Then you have to go over to either 3rd.  You have to work your way up to 57th.  Make a left on 57th and take that directly because the streets go.  It goes 3rd, then Lake Madison, then Park, and then Lexington, blah, blah, blah, all the way. 
[00:44:30]  You are so confusing.  It's a grid.  Totally.  It's a grid system.  Okay.  So just work it.  If you end up at 2nd and, what, 38th around there or something, just work the grid until  you get up to 57th and 7th.  Okay.  I'm getting ready to pay now.  Oh, you're in the tunnel?  I'm getting ready to pay for it, yeah.  All right, Kelly, this is what you do.  When you get on the other side of the tunnel, give us a call back.  Okay. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Godspeed.  We're going to get through this.  We're going to get through this one.  We're going to get through this.  We're going to turn this thing around.  We're going to get through this.  We're just going to keep your chin up.  Keep your chin up.  Let's just stick with me.  At best we'll turn this thing around.  We're going to talk you in.  So when you get through the tunnel, call us back.  Okay.  All right.  There she goes.  Kelly.  Bye.  We're going to be throwing her in a dumpster when she gets here.  You know, I love the support that Cleveland gives us.  Yeah.  As far as the Opie and Anthony show goes.  But we're going to get one of their fine people killed. 
[00:45:30]  Killed as they're coming in here.  They're so motivated to come down to New York and help out the radio show.  But they're getting lost.  This is great.  Mac from New Jersey brings up a great frigging point.  How could she miss New York City?  It's only been on TV every day since September.  Like Manhattan every day of the week.  You can tune in and see New York City.  But the funny part about that was she knew she was in the city but didn't stop. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  And then panicked somewhere along the line and just said, well, I'll keep going.  Maybe it'll turn me back around or something.  I like the fact that this is great, too.  I love the fact that she missed our studios at 57th and 7th, went into Queens,  and just decided to look for another 57th and 7th.  She goes, oh, I'm on 44th and Vernon.  44th.  Ah, well, yeah, use that grid then.  The one over in Queens.  And then if she could go to Brooklyn and maybe try 57th and 7th there.  You know what?  Rick rocks.  Oh, wow.  Rick has decided to take some more pictures of Stephanie, 
[00:46:30]  the winner of the Naughty Naughty Contest, before she heads back to Washington.  Rick.  Photo by Rick.  Rick.  Could you move her chair, please?  I got it.  Thank you.  Yeah, let's put these.  And we'll put some of this on the stinky chair.  Are you wearing a thong or nothing?  I love her.  Nothing.  She's nothing under the jeans.  She wanted to go to some of the seedier places last night.  She just told us.  Stephanie has a website, and we're going to link it to foundrymusic.com.  It's www.vav1xen.com. 
[00:47:00]  www.vav1xen?  Yeah.  What are you, a Scrabble player?  What is that?  She's trying to do something that I don't think is going to work for her.  But basically, it's www.vavixen.com, but the I is a one.  That's going to screw up everybody.  Give it a try.  www.vavixen.com, but the I is a one. 
[00:47:30]  All right?  No, it's not.  Hey, there's the hiney.  The hiney is sexy on its own.  You don't show half of it.  Hey!  All right.  Wow.  The $20 bill is not $10.  I got some of that ass shot up there on...  Rand McNally.  What's up?  Hey.  Oh, and hey.  Oh, and hey.  What's up?  Big fan.  I'm going to drive off the frigging road with this chick.  She's killing me.  Isn't it frustrating?  Yeah, it is. 
[00:48:00]  I'm dying over here.  Good luck bringing her home.  Okay, boys?  Well, now, who's turning off the radio?  I know it's not the most exciting thing, but now you've got to know if she made it through  the tunnel.  All right.  No, no, no.  I'll tune in.  This is going to be great.  I can't wait for the finale.  All right.  Rand McNally.  Rand McNally checking out.  Call me a tool.  See you.  All right.  See you, tool.  The big brick ones, the Empire State Building.  Rick's getting some great, great shots before Stephanie leaves us.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:48:30]  Wow.  Hold on.  I'm going to have to update.  Wow, wait.  I've got to update here.  Yeah, update for the listeners.  Oh, no.  I think I just updated with Steve or Stinky walking right in front of the...  Wow.  Yes.  Yes.  There we go.  I hope you people are enjoying this little show on the Stinky Camp.  Wow, that's a good shot right there.  Brian, what's up?  I'm thinking I might take that new chick from logistics.  Stinko, well, I might be showing her my O face.  O, O, O.  You know what I'm talking about. 
[00:49:00]  O.  Well, thank you for that.  Thanks a lot.  That's pretty funny.  O, O, O, my O face.  O.  Orlando, what's up?  Steve?  Yo, I got an early...  What did I learn?  Yeah, go ahead.  A few days ago, I learned that naked chicks in the woods are kind of hot.  Yeah, definitely.  Today, I learned that naked old guys in the woods are never good.  Never good.  Never.  And how do you think Stinky's old roommate used to moan when he used to look at the porn?  Oh!  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Like that.  Oh, one more thing.  Norton.  Yes, sir?  I was just listening to an Osborne commercial.  Who do you think raises more hell, you or him?  I don't know.  You know what an awful commercial?  Peace.  I think you will.  They forget nothing.  Oh, they just have fun.  He's here to raise some hell.  Hey, one of our new friends is checking in.  Oh, wait, but Kelly might be checking in.  Pablo Francisco.  Who's this?  It's O.P. and Anthony.  Are you ready?  Opening Anthony. 
[00:50:00]  One team together.  One station.  One pinball machine smashed to the bejesus.  It's the movie guy.  I heard you guys got a new TV show.  You guys want to hear?  I got a clip of it.  You ready for it?  Yeah, let's hear it.  On the makers of Baywatch and Baywatch Nights comes O&A Beach starring David Hasselhoff.  Listen, someone smashed my pinball machine, guy.  All the way down to Smith of Rains.  What's going on?  And a mean real estate investor played by Arnold Schwarzenegger tries to take O&A Beach. 
[00:50:30]  Listen to me.  This beach belongs to me.  You have to give it up.  Give it up.  On the next O&A.  That's hilarious.  What's up, Pablo?  Not much, man.  I'm up in Cleveland, so if anybody out there wants to come to Cleveland Improv tonight, we're selling out shows.  You guys are popular everywhere, man.  I went to San Jose.  You guys were up there.  Seattle.  We're not popular in Seattle.  We're not popular in Seattle.  I went somewhere.  Someone told me.  Hey, man, I heard you.  I got a lot of people from San Francisco area. 
[00:51:00]  Seattle, the ratings came in, and we were a 0.00.  In San Jose, San Francisco area, right?  Yeah.  Okay, that's where it was, man.  All right.  So what's happening, man?  Well, we're a little distracted because Stephanie, who won the Naughty Nighty contest, is pretty  much nude in our studio right now.  What?  Rick takes some final pictures of her.  Yes.  You can check her out on our websites there, Pablo.  Okay, well, I've got to get to it.  So does she have a little Hitler quacky?  She hasn't shown us down much yet.  She's kind of teasing now with the jeans that are still on. 
[00:51:30]  I want to take a hiding.  But she's completely topless.  She showed the hiney.  Where were you?  Rick, she had half the hiney.  Very good.  The half hiney's nice.  She was showing the hiney.  There's a problem with the picture that's on the stinky cam, by the way.  If she could stand up and just take another one because she was moving both arms as she  did it, and the stinky cam didn't pick it up.  It looks like she's armless, and a lot of people are complaining that it looks like your  arms have been cut off.  That's sexy, actually.  Oh, that sucks, man.  That means she can't count her tips.  So just, yeah.  No, no. 
[00:52:00]  Show your arms.  There you go.  Now, pull that down.  All right.  Just like that.  I think that might be it.  Let's see.  Show your arms.  Let's see when it updates.  Sorry, Pablo.  Oh, yeah, man.  What?  Is she Jewish?  What is she?  Huh?  We don't know.  What are you?  French, Canadian, and English.  All right.  Turn sideways.  Oh, man, her mom got around.  Yeah, turn sideways a little.  Pablo.  Just a little.  There you go.  Yeah, she, uh...  Oh, that's bad. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's good stuff.  Yeah, because you keep moving the goddamn camera when I click.  Diddly, diddly, diddly.  It'd be like if you had Jay Leno doing a sex line with her.  Okay, so show me your butt.  Okay, that's good.  And how about show me a little cleavage?  That sounds good.  And that's good.  We'll be right back after this.  Let's go to a clip.  You know what?  Now her cell phone's ringing.  I think that's her boyfriend downstairs going, where the F are you?  Are you serious?  Uh-oh, Kelly's out of the tunnel, too. 
[00:53:00]  All right, hold on, Pablo.  You got it, baby.  You're in the middle of, like, a lot of crazy little things.  Hold on.  Got you, baby.  You're on, though.  We didn't put you back on hold.  Kelly!  Yes.  All right, Kelly, you're out of the tunnel?  Yes.  All right, now where are you?  I'm going down 34th West.  30?  All right, you're on 34th.  You're heading west.  And what was the cross street you just crossed?  I just actually turned on 34th.  Third.  Third, I'm coming up to third.  All right, you're coming up to third.  Oh, bad move.  I would have went all the way to eighth.  No, no, don't.  She's not turning on eighth.  I mean on third.  No, I'm still on 34th.  She's still on 34th. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, yeah, go all the way to, like, eighth.  Okay.  And then head uptown.  So 34th to eighth.  And then where's she going to park?  34th to eighth.  Eighth moves a lot faster.  Sixth.  All right, man.  No.  Then she can't make the left.  Okay.  Yeah.  Go all the way to eighth.  Up to 56th.  All right, you turn on 56th.  You'll see a Hooters.  Right after the Hooters is a nice garage you can park in.  Which way do I turn?  On which road? 
[00:54:00]  56th.  Right.  Okay, so I've got to take 34th to eighth.  Right.  And I turn which way?  Right.  You can only go one way on eighth.  It's north.  If you go left, you'll get in big trouble.  Oh, okay.  I got it.  You got two turns to make now.  That's it.  Okay.  And a third into the garage.  Now, you got to listen closely.  When you're on 56th, after you turn on 56th, make that right on 56th.  Right when you cross over Broadway.  Okay. 
[00:54:30]  The parking garage is after Hooters on the left.  Okay.  All right.  Don't forget that.  Yeah, Hooters.  How do you get an application there?  They pull out a bronze.  They fill this out.  Woo-hoo!  Hey, Kelly, do you want a welcoming party?  No, I don't.  You sure?  I'm positive.  You give them the make and the model of your car there, and we'll have a bunch of people  waiting for you.  No, but I won't do that.  All right.  All right.  We'll see.  If you have any problems, give us a call back.  Okay.  Actually, call us when you get on Ace.  What the hell?  Yeah, you better do that. 
[00:55:00]  I might.  We don't have a lot of confidence in you right now.  Yeah.  Where are you now, ma'am?  I have a lot of confidence.  Ma'am, where are you now, ma'am?  I'm still on 34th.  I haven't even passed, like, I'm passing Lexington now.  All right.  All right.  It's moving slow, right?  So you're going, uh...  Yes, it's going very slow.  You're westward bound, are you?  Yes, I'm westward bound.  I think someone recognized you because...  Don't go over...  No, they weren't beeping at me.  If there's any toll, turn around.  Yeah, don't go over any more water.  Right.  Okay. 
[00:55:30]  Stay away from the water.  Okay, I will.  You're on Manhattan Island.  You're in the biggest city in the world right now.  Don't leave it.  Don't get lost.  Look up at all the pretty buildings.  You should go.  Take a cup or something if you have to.  That's my problem.  I was looking at all the buildings.  Well, man, this one's a rocket science.  Yeah.  Nice thing you know, you're in Queens.  Like coming to America.  All right, Kelly.  Call us in a little bit.  All right.  It's not about you.  We've got to talk to Pablo now.  Okay.  Oh, Kelly?  How much do you want to bet she gets a cobblestone block put over her head by a homeless man 
[00:56:00]  before she even makes it up here?  You know how the homeless can be around here?  Yeah, they do exactly what everyone would love to do.  Put a cobblestone block over her head.  You want to go out now?  I really...  I am Sam.  That's what they are, the homeless, around there.  Paris Drake, that guy's name was.  Paris Drake.  You remember all the criminals.  Yeah.  You're very good with that.  I don't know anything about square roots or mathematics, but what homeless animal crashed  a brick into a white lady's head?  I can remember that and whack my bag. 
[00:56:30]  And whack the bag?  Someone's whacking his bag.  Someone's playing a deadly game by whacking his bag.  That'd be a movie guy doing pornos.  Wouldn't that be worse?  Oh, that would rock.  Are you ready this summer?  Get ready for climactic orgasm.  He was a midget who worked for Santa too long.  I love this job.  And he was a pimp on the edge.  I need my hose.  He may be a midget, but he's home like King Kong.  Get ready this summer.  Frosty the home man.  Okay.  Movie, I don't know. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, hilarious.  Movie guy having sex?  Here we go.  Here we go.  Movie guy having sex.  Oh, yeah.  Ah, the passion in your eyes burns with desire.  Hurry up!  Hurry up!  Coming soon.  All right.  All right, Pablo.  We'll see you next time here in New York.  All right, man.  It's the Improv in Cleveland.  What?  All weekend long?  All weekend long.  Here's the number if anybody wants to come down.  It's 216-696-7723 in Cleveland.  Yeah, I mean, Pablo's hilarious. 
[00:57:30]  Hey, I saw your thing on Comedy Central.  Very, very good.  Thanks a lot, bro.  Really enjoyed that.  Thanks a lot, man.  Can you give us a little Aaron Neville as we go to break here?  But I'm talking about your hands.  Steve loves to unanswered.  So, welcome to the jungle.  We have fun and games.  We can do that.  Everyone's going to bring you to your knees.  Not that, not that, not that, me.  Aaron Neville sounds like you're trying to find a radio station.  Traffic on the... 
[00:58:00]  You know the deal.  Yeah, you're all right, man.  All right, Pablo, thank you.  Hey, thank you, guys, man.  Take care, guys.  Improv in Cleveland.  We highly recommend you go see Pablo.  Tell him we said hi, too, all right?  All right, Pablo.  See you, buddy.  There he goes.  It's funny, man.  Aaron Neville.  We got to get you out of here, Steph?  Yeah.  Aw, she's got to go?  Yeah.  Stephanie, the winner of the Naughty Nighty Contest, leaving us, Anthony.  Yeah.  Well, we got Kelly to take your place, so.  Oh.  I just wanted to say thank you.  Out with the old, in with the new. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, no, it's just kidding.  You had a good time?  Yes, I had a great time.  Cool.  It's nice to meet you.  How are you getting back to Washington?  Driving now.  You're driving.  You're not going to get lost or nothing, right?  No, no, no.  We made it here.  Yeah.  No problem.  I'm sorry about the whole begging and offering your money thing.  And our website is www.vavixen.com.  The I's a one in Vixen.  It's the same as the email.  It's just a little bit that we did on the air with the AOL and IM thing.  All right.  And we got a lot of email from that, and so we decided to make one. 
[00:59:00]  I bet.  That's your email, too?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And it'll be linked to foundrymusic.com.  All right.  I think when we get back, we've got to talk about Nixon wanting to nuke Vietnam.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  What a classic, tricky-dicky story.  Yes.  Dick Nixon.  A lot of tapes were released, and apparently he wanted to nuke Vietnam.  Yeah.  And we'll look at the curled milk to see if it's ready.  Is that girl on the way?  Yeah.  That's the showstopper today.  Amelia Earhart.  Huh? 
[00:59:30]  Amelia Earhart, who's lost, or the other one?  No.  The other one.  Kelly is coming here just so we can throw her in a dumpster in her bra and panties.  Great.  Hopefully, uh, Mike O'Brien's listening.  He'll have more fodder for his next article.  What a dick.  What's, what's, Michael, what's that?  Oh, you didn't read this?  No, I started.  During the break, you'll have to read this and get angry.  Yeah, read it so you can be, uh.  Oh, thanks a lot, Ben.  Read it so you can be prepared for, uh, for the next segment there, Jimmy.  Nick's betting, uh, she goes straight through to the Lincoln Tunnel and ends up in Jersey. 
[01:00:00]  That would be hilarious.  If you stay on that road, you'll go right through, yeah.  If she hits Newark, she's on her own.  It seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable.  O.B. and Anthony.  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area. 
[01:00:30]  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including, Anthony, Sacramento, California.  866-2774.  Wow.  I noticed that, uh, Jim Norton bought an eight-second spot on our show.  Yes.  Excited.  Who buys these commercials for you?  The, uh, the promoters do.  But they can't afford to buy the big one-minute ones, man. 
[01:01:00]  They're too expensive.  So his, uh, promoter, Anthony, he's playing in town hall April 18th in, uh, New York City.  Tickets going, uh, quite nicely.  Very well, yes.  They can't afford the 60-second commercials?  I don't know how much they are.  They're expensive.  So they figured, ah, what the hell, we'll buy an eight-second commercial?  An eight-second commercial.  Is the sales department crying?  Well, a little bit.  You know what?  Let them cry.  I don't care.  What is wrong with you?  Nothing.  I don't care.  What's wrong with your promoter that they can't buy a few 60-second spots? 
[01:01:30]  It's expensive.  You know how silly an eight-second spot sounds for your show?  I know.  Listen to this.  Jim Norton's Yellow Discipline Tour hits town hall Thursday, April 18th.  Get to your Ticketmaster location now.  What?  What was?  Was that it?  I realized.  Hey, we just ran that for free, so.  It's a white trash commercial.  I know that, but, you know, compared to New York City, the major events are usually 40 or  50 bucks.  I must say, uh, your promoter is assuming a lot right there. 
[01:02:00]  What if the person doesn't know who Jim Norton is?  What if?  Chances are they don't.  They're not playing on their show.  That's why the 60-second spots, you know, they might be able to give a little of your act.  Like, oh, I don't, I never heard of Jim Norton, but that couple lines I just heard are kind  of funny.  Right, right.  Well, you guys, if you didn't have such a hot show, it wouldn't be so expensive.  I mean, that's the problem.  It's expensive.  Oh.  And it's true.  It really is.  I mean, the prices are very expensive, and I'm not making that much money in this game.  Dice at the Beacon is making a lot of money. 
[01:02:30]  I'm not making a lot of money.  So, he can afford big spots.  When Ben sees this on the commercial log, he laughs like a little schoolgirl.  He thinks it's the funniest thing that there's just eight-second commercials for your show.  That really, the guy in the sales department, look, I know you guys got a job to do or  whatever, but, all right, already, with how much, all right?  Oh, what, they're pressuring?  No.  No, they're not pressuring.  No, but just, I know they're annoyed.  We're just making fun.  All right.  I know they're pissed off.  Jim, you do have to be happy, because originally, they had only bought one eight-second commercial.  They've now bought three.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  You're up to a total of 24 seconds.  24 seconds of quality commercial time.  Of promotion for your show.  You know what might be good is, like, one eight-second spot, they just say your name,  and then the other eight-second spot, maybe they could use to do a couple of your lines  from your comedy show.  And then the third eight-second spot, they could kind of just give the date of the show,  and then the listener could put it all together in their mind.  Like a cereal.  And if the guy is sitting there listening for 18 straight hours, he'll know exactly what  to do.  Exactly.  And when to see old Jimmy Norton.  It's like a miniseries commercial. 
[01:03:30]  Every show in the country I'm doing so far is sold out, except New York.  It's the only one I still have to...  Uh-oh.  New York.  No, it's fine.  It'll go.  It's a big old venue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And by the way, it's on the 43rd between 7th and 6th.  We're 6th and 4th.  People ask me, where's Town Hall?  How do you not know where Town Hall is?  It's one of the most well-known venues in Manhattan.  But thank you, anyway, for helping me whore that now.  Relax, dude.  I know.  I'm really...  I just read this effing article.  I'm really annoyed.  Oh, good.  Well, you know what?  We found another guy that doesn't appreciate our brand of humor, Anthony. 
[01:04:00]  Yes.  His name's Michael Bryan.  Yeah.  And I wrote an article in one of the papers out there in Sacramento.  Doesn't like our brand of humor.  What's the name of the paper?  Nomination?  Nomination.  Nomination.  Or is that a...  That might be an ad.  Oh, here it is.  Latest issue of Sacramento Magazine.  Wow.  That's all.  Oh, it's a...  It's a...  The article's titled, Turned Off.  Turned Off.  Headline reads, Turned Off. 
[01:04:30]  Turned Off.  And it's all about this fine radio program, Anthony.  All right.  You want me to read a little?  Oh, sure.  And then we can just comment as we go along.  I tuned in a local FM radio station targeting young adults as I drove to pick up my 13-year-old  daughter after her practice.  The two women who wrote...  Oh!  What was she wearing?  The two women who wrote Sacramento's February cover story about eligible singles had been  invited to be on that station to talk about the story.  And I wanted to listen beforehand to see what the format was like. 
[01:05:00]  Of course, talking about the fine station KX.  Oh, wait.  Right.  What I heard was awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Turned Off.  That means we are doing our job, Anthony.  Yep.  What I heard was awful.  Awful.  A few male disc jockeys talking crudely.  Oh, God forbid.  Crudely.  Crudely.  You're not playing?  Dude, you don't understand.  It was your turn to say crudely. 
[01:05:30]  I'm sorry.  I really get annoyed.  He is so aggravated and annoyed with the story.  It's a short article.  We'll give you a chance.  All right.  A few male disc jockeys talking crudely.  Crudely.  Asking women.  Crudely.  Crudely.  Asking women to join a contest to lose their virginity.  Yeah.  And to lose it wherever you want.  In a car, under an overpass, in the desert, wherever.  They also asked women to call in and feign orgasms.  Feign orgasms.  We're asking women to call in and feign orgasms.  F-E-I-G-N. 
[01:06:00]  He makes it sound so fun.  Yeah.  Like his wife has been...  You can't say the F-U thing.  Why?  Norton.  I wasn't sure if that was Jim Norton or audio from our meeting with Ken Stevens.  Yeah.  Uh, feign.  Yes.  Feign orgasms on the air.  Uh, and they promoted a naughty 90s contest where my listeners emailed in photos, which would  then be posted on the station's website.  Yeah.  Oh.  There was no emailing of photos, but okay, I'll give you that one. 
[01:06:30]  Turned off!  Turned off!  There's...  Turned off.  I thought the program was tacky, unoriginal, and especially demeaning to women.  I worry that young men listening could, over time, compromise their respect for women.  Here it is.  My daughter included.  Yeah, there it is.  There it is.  Hey, hey, jack off, douchebag, ass eff.  Douchebag!  Dick.  What people hear on this show, I want any proof whatsoever, any inkling of evidence... 
[01:07:00]  Inkling!  ...that what is said on this show or any other show about anyone else leads people to, uh,  anything from disrespect to violence.  I'll give you proof, disrespect, the way I treat women.  It's horrible.  Suck and get out of the car.  It's some middle-aged fraud with a 13-year-old sea of a daughter. 
[01:07:30]  No one cares about your daughter.  She's your effing problem.  We're not supposed to have a good time on the radio because you got some 13-year-old dummy.  She's probably blah, blah, blah, blah already.  Don't you watch HBO, stupid?  I am so sick.  You know how old he is?  I'm sorry to do this.  This guy, this guy, I am reminded of sitting on the beach in Aptos in 1967 with several friends.  We were listening to the long version of Going Home and the Rolling Stones' Aftermath album.  Not because we loved it, but because we heard that if you listened carefully, you could hear Mick Jagger utter the F word. 
[01:08:00]  He was 17 when that happened.  When I was 17, me and my jaguar friends would never have sat around listening for the F word on an album.  You have been a faggot since you were born.  You would never have gone.  You probably didn't like Lenny Bruce.  You probably didn't like Richard Pryor.  And I'm not saying that this show is Lenny Bruce or Richard Pryor.  Don't misinterpret that.  I don't mean that.  That was political.  More Andy Kaufman.  Okay, Andy Kaufman.  You can go with Andy Kaufman.  Go ahead.  That just really, really bugs me.  He is, how old is he?  He's 1950. 
[01:08:30]  He was born.  You are a 52-year-old boar with a little pot belly and a stupid daughter.  If you don't like it, you don't think it's funny, fine.  I respect that.  But as far as, you know, it's going to teach young men disrespect for women and my daughter.  Four years from now when they're picking her up, they're going to be trying to get it sucked before they drop her off anyway.  It doesn't matter if they listen to this or dance music.  I'm so tired of parents and your mother effing kids.  It's not my responsibility.  I don't have kids.  That's why I leave it in the dumper or in the mouth because I hate kids. 
[01:09:00]  Do you understand what I mean?  That makes me want to vomit.  This arrogant, faggot, yuppie mentality.  I don't care about your kids.  I have a nephew.  I love my nephew.  But you know what?  I'm good to him.  You want to raise your kids right?  Raise them right.  I don't care what he listens to on the radio.  That's hilarious.  Oh, my God.  Bravo.  Dude, I am so...  Bravo.  I'm doing stand-up for 12 years.  I've been dealing...  I know you guys have been doing...  I'm dealing with these people like this for so long, writing their letters. 
[01:09:30]  Toilet humor.  And meanwhile, this is the type of guy that works for Enron that will rape you and F you out of everything you've ever earned.  But if you say something on the radio that's sexual, all of a sudden, oh, my daughter's listening.  And she's also riding in a Jaguar.  Oh, God.  That really, really, really bugs me, man.  It really bugs me.  It amazes me.  I do honestly believe bad parenting does more damage and causes more things than radio or television. 
[01:10:00]  What we're doing on this show...  What's this guy's name?  Mike.  Mike O'Brien.  Mike.  Which really jumps right out at you, doesn't it?  Well, that Mike O'Brien had something to say.  What we do on this show...  You show me...  You know, all you goody-goodies spout this all the time without backing it up with one bit of fact  that this type of program makes people treat women worse or promotes violence against races or sexual preferences. 
[01:10:30]  Show me something.  Don't just blurt it out because you don't like it.  Show me something.  Read the last two paragraphs.  I know Jim read, like, the first line or two, but it gets even better.  Him and his friends sitting around at the beach.  Yeah, sitting around at the beach.  17 years old.  Waiting, going, here it comes, here it comes.  Here comes the F word.  Here comes the F word, other faggots that I'm hanging with. 
[01:11:00]  Here comes the F word.  Who did that at 17?  I was puking and cutting my wrist when I was 17.  God, what a pussy.  Here it is.  Yeah, sitting around the beach, listening carefully.  You could hear Mick Jagger utter the F word.  Again and again, we played the tune and debated exactly what was said.  I recall feeling rather adult about it.  As I did not want anyone telling me at 17 what I could or could not listen to.  Mike, the world has passed you by. 
[01:11:30]  That's the problem.  Ponytail-wearing, middle-aged douchebag.  Here he says it.  But the world seemed to have a clear boundary as to what was acceptable.  In 67, yeah, a boundary.  What?  Fire hosing blacks in the South and sending youngsters from this country to be killed in a war we had nothing, no business to be in.  Yeah, yeah.  There was such clearer boundaries.  Oh, but he was listening to the F word.  Oh, really skirting those boundaries. 
[01:12:00]  And then claiming it was a time of love when all the hippies, you were fraudulent and drug-addicted.  All you did was spit on soldiers when they came back.  But we loved each other.  A bunch of acid-tripping dirtbags.  And now they are the yuppies like this guy now.  And I just, what am I doing?  Anti-establishment.  The establishment's wrong.  Today, boundaries seem non-existent.  He says.  Today, boundaries seem non-existent.  As opposed to those wacky 60s where, oh, yeah, yeah, that was a time listening to the F word on the beach with your friends. 
[01:12:30]  Would you like to know a boundary, by the way?  Here's a direct boundary.  Opie and Anthony make a lot of money.  You are a jizz bag writer for a one-city magazine.  That's a nice boundary.  They're rich, and you're a nobody, you 52-year-old flunky.  Hey, Norton.  We don't make that much money.  Whose check did you look at lately?  I read the reports.  I don't know.  Ouch.  I read the same reports everybody else did.  I'm still trying to downplay that, you know.  That's right.  You're not helping the matter.  Awful dressers.  Exactly.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:13:00]  A simple barricade's just waiting.  But to me, dumb DJs laughing like Beavis and Butthead while they blather crudely on the air.  Are we blathering?  I like the word blather.  That I actually agree with.  Yeah, we like that.  You are blathering.  That's a compliment to us, Anthony.  Goes beyond pushing the limits.  It's toilet humor broadcasts that...  This makes no sense, this line.  Try to figure this out.  Toilet humor broadcasts that demean people are damaging to the public good. 
[01:13:30]  What?  Give me a fact.  He's stating that something is damaging to the public good.  In what way?  Why doesn't it say, in my opinion, toilet humor broadcast?  You use nothing to back this up.  Mike, you sound just like your dad did in 1967.  How does it feel?  And you're just as big a failure and your voice was never heard.  I'll back something up, Mike.  I'll state something and back it up, okay?  If you have a 13-year-old daughter now, I would say odds are, based on statistics and studies 
[01:14:00]  that have been done and research, not like your thing, based on research, if somebody  at this time in their life has a 13-year-old daughter, she is probably sucking C.  And it's backed up with fact, Opie.  It's backed up with fact.  A lot of 13-year-old girls are at least performing oral sex in the schools. 
[01:14:30]  A lot of them.  So there's a chance that if you have a 13-year-old daughter right now, she might be sucking on  a knob at school.  And that's backed up with fact.  And that's because of us?  No, I'm not talking about anybody in particular.  I'm just stating a fact.  Like, he doesn't say, Opie and Anthony, but are they sucking the C's because of us?  No, absolutely not.  God, wouldn't that be great to know?  I would love to be responsible for that.  And no one's saying this guy's a bad parent.  He might be a great parent.  I'm just tired of parents. 
[01:15:00]  Stop mentioning your effing kids.  Who cares?  No one cares.  You know why?  It's the self-importance.  When someone has kids, and you know something?  That's fine and dandy.  You want to treat your kid like a prince or a princess?  There's no problem with that.  Do it.  Raise your kid however the hell you want.  But to ask anybody to take responsibility for their upbringing besides you?  Screw off.  We're here to have fun and entertain adults.  Yep, exactly. 
[01:15:30]  There you go.  We can't put Barney on 24 hours a day.  I'm sure you'd love that.  Let's just put Barney on.  You know why?  Because if Barney was on TV, and a Barney show was on radio, and Barney was at the movies  24 hours a day, it would be a perfect world.  You know why?  Because people would grow up loving and accepting and caring, and there wouldn't be all this dirty  stuff to turn the mind.  And you know something?  Everything would be fine.  We'd live in a paradise in a few years.  Because people would be raised with love and tenderness, and every adult would run into 
[01:16:00]  video stores shooting everybody because there's nothing entertaining on it.  Yeah, but you know what would be great, guys?  Maybe later we could all sit around and listen for the F word at the beach.  We'll go to the beach and listen to the F word on a Rolling Stones album.  Does that not tell you all you need to know about this little over middle-aged douche?  If the guy said I was 13 and 12 and doing that, I would say, all right, but if you're  17 sitting on a beach trying to hear the F word, and you have other jagoffs that are 
[01:16:30]  willing to do it, you are going to be a doll mother effer when you're an adult, and that's  exactly what it is.  And that's what I see by his little article.  Bravo!  Bravo!  Flunky, pussy, boring, unheard of writer on the West Coast.  Mike O'Brien turned off!  Ooh, that turned off!  I'm turned off!  Turned off!  There you go.  And good luck to you, parent, hero, doing your job day in, day out. 
[01:17:00]  Shutting us off on the radio.  Which, hey, that's fine.  Absolutely.  You know something?  That ain't going to do it, though.  That ain't going to do nothing.  Man, it ain't about what this show presents on a daily basis, that we have problems in  society, and that 13-year-old girls are in school hobbing knobs and giving up the A to  stay a virgin.  Yeah.  It's happening.  And it ain't because of this show. 
[01:17:30]  I'd love to think it was.  Dude, I've gotten...  I'd volunteer to go on 24 hours a day if I thought we were promoting sex.  I've gotten emails from people going, you're not funny, you suck.  I, that, all right, you accept it.  People think that something's funny, they think you're not funny as a person.  When people get offended like that, that's what makes me sick.  Now, I don't think it's funny.  There's plenty of people that think my punchline stinks.  Fine.  But when they're offended, when they think it's bad, that's what makes me sick. 
[01:18:00]  Bad for society.  You know, if you think it sucks, fine, but, you know, I don't care about your kids, man.  I'm sorry.  I'm not going to pretend I do.  I'm not interested.  If you're a parent, don't tell me about your kids.  I don't want to hear it.  I don't care.  Bravo.  I really don't.  And I like kids.  I just don't want to hear about a great job you're doing, making the world safe for  them.  Drop dead.  Drop dead.  We're going to continue with the theme and go to the FU line in.  Yeah.  And we've got to talk about Nixon nuke in Vietnam next.  Uh-huh.  All right.  We also have, finally, it's been a while, but we have an unlucky lottery. 
[01:18:30]  Do we really?  We've had a lot of suck to be used, but I consider this an unlucky lottery.  All right.  Yeah.  We'll do that next as well.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  I'd like to give a big FU out to the lady at ShopRite in South Jersey.  You brought over 100 items into a 15 item in left lane.  You broke it up into six different orders so you can fit all your cart crap in there,  and then you paid with it with six different personal checks, in which the last check didn't  clear.  And then you looked at all of us like you didn't know what the hell you were doing. 
[01:19:00]  FU, die of gunnery of the mouth, and I hope Henry IV takes a visit to your house.  Jank, mothball, bitch.  F.  U.  Next message.  This is a Tom giving a giant FU to that feggety little Frenchman Frenchie.  Why don't you go inject yourself with pink dinner?  Stupid horse-eating Frenchman.  You impotent little snail eater FU.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big FU to my brother Jeremy's girlfriend Shannon.  Everybody in this family except Jeremy knows what a stuck-up, controlling, arrogant, evil 
[01:19:30]  bitch you are.  Just let go of his leash.  You don't make our brother happy.  You just tell him that.  He believes it.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to believe an FU to that F and C that was sitting next to me as he started  throwing over a basketball game.  They wouldn't even shut her yet.  I mean, if she had a C in her mouth every once in a while, she wouldn't be so goddamn loud.  F-U.  End of message.  Opie and Anthony.  At the last supper, they would have wiped their asses with the tablecloth. 
[01:20:00]  That's just what Christ wanted.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Is this for shock factor?  Hang up on this picture.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  M-D-W.  Hold on!  They're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got some people fired up on the phones, Anthony.  Barbara, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Barbara.  That guy from... 
[01:20:30]  That guy from...  Oh, he just got me so mad.  That guy from Sacramento got me so mad.  Yeah, Mike O'Brien.  Okay, now the thing is, like, okay, I'm going to be 42 in a couple of weeks, all right?  So, 1972, I was already messing around with guys.  I grew up listening to W-A-B-C-A-M, you know, Harry Harrison, all that stuff.  I watched the Brady Bunch and the Parker family, all that mess.  And I was still out, hot and trotting, running all over the place. 
[01:21:00]  Really?  Yeah.  It says that you lost your virginity at 14?  Yep.  In 1974?  Yep.  Well, we can blame the Brady Bunch, eh?  Exactly.  The Brady Bunch made girls lose their virginity back in 1974.  Anyway, that's it, guys.  All right, thank you.  All right, bye.  Bye.  A couple more, then we've got to move on.  Kristen, what's going on?  Kristen!  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's up?  Listen, this guy who's complaining about his daughter hearing the material that you guys 
[01:21:30]  are saying, he needs to get a clue, because if you're actually a good parent, why isn't  he monitoring what she's listening to?  Well, he turned the radio off when the little perfect angel got in the car.  But he doesn't think that's good enough.  You know what it is, too?  It isn't about, really, I'm not a parent.  I am.  Thank God, and I really don't care.  But I don't even think it's about monitoring what your kids listen to, because kids are  going to be kids and listen to whatever the F they want to listen to.  It's a matter of then maybe even explaining it with them, talking about it, doing that 
[01:22:00]  stupid parent stuff.  Yeah, whatever.  It's not about trying to prohibit them from listening to anything by either cutting it off  from them or having it removed from the airwaves completely.  Like, based on your children, you're going to decide what adults can or can't listen  to.  The concept there is ridiculous.  I have a seven-year-old little boy, and if he comes to me with questions concerning  sex, girls, anything, I'm very open.  I bring it right out there.  We talk about it. 
[01:22:30]  I don't want him hearing about it from anybody else.  You know what the thing is, too?  When I was growing up, I heard some nasty stuff on TV, movies, magazines, whatever.  You know what?  It's part of growing up.  Kids are exposed to stuff like that.  Yeah.  It's not going to go away.  We're not going to live in this Vulcan society where all of a sudden, you know, it just doesn't  happen.  Kids will get their hand on porno.  They'll get their hand on drugs.  They'll get their hands on booze.  It's a matter of how a parent prepares their kid to deal with those things, not cutting 
[01:23:00]  them off from it completely.  Oh, that's going to just make them want to listen that much more.  Right.  Parents have to realize, I mean, you're right, kids can get their hands on alcohol, porn,  drugs.  We all did it.  I mean, I'll provide any of that stuff.  When I was a kid, you know what?  Parents have to discipline your kids.  When I was a kid, man, I would curse.  My father would take soap and scrape it against my teeth.  I happen to me, too.  So I didn't curse in front of my father anymore.  I got that, too.  I got a smack.  And look what it did for you.  Yeah, exactly.  See, I'm an absolute failure with meaty breasts and a prostitute habit. 
[01:23:30]  So maybe that was a bad example.  You're always so kind to yourself, Norris.  I said schmuck once when I was a kid.  I said, that stupid schmuck.  And...  I hope he smacked me.  Whap!  He smacked me in the face.  You're not Jewish.  You're a little Italian.  He's not Jewish, and it sounded too much like the F word, the way I used it.  Bottom line.  And I got smacked in the head for that.  You know his daughter has issues.  All right.  No.  You know she does.  She's 14.  Let me tell you, when I was 14... 
[01:24:00]  I don't know.  Come on.  We all know.  We all know what's going on.  I mean, I went to school with nuns.  I'm 30 now.  We had girls bringing in porno magazines.  We were looking.  If he has a problem with his daughter, sit down and talk to your daughter, but don't pin it  on the media.  I mean, turn on the news.  All right, Kristen.  Thank you.  By the way, 13-year-old Anthony, why were you...  What am I, a schmuck on wheels?  That's cigarette hijacking Mick.  F him, Henry.  I want my money.  I want my money.  I know.  All of a sudden, I was using Hasidic words.  I don't know.  Yiddish, I was speaking. 
[01:24:30]  You're going to talk to Jimmy Conaway like that?  That's cigarette hijacking Mick.  Shannon.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi, Shannon.  I'm Danish from Bell.  What's up?  I'm 15, and...  There are girls that do.  They still stay in school.  They bring porn over to school, but not a lot of them do.  Right.  If...  And these people, it's all over the radio.  It's all over the movies. 
[01:25:00]  It's all over the TV.  This is where they're getting it from.  It's not one solitary show.  This guy has no clue what he's talking about.  Uh-oh.  I think she just hung us out to dry, Opie.  I see you agree with Michael Bryan.  No, don't forget, here's the difference.  In the 50s, when there was less of this stuff on the radio and television, there was still  a lot of teenage pregnancy.  The difference was you married back then quickly.  But people make it look like the 50s were these ideal, wonderful times.  Oh, please.  Blacks were being beaten.  They couldn't vote.  Women couldn't vote for...  Well, that's the 20s.  But, you know, women couldn't get paid the same amount.  You know, as much as we tease women, they're still making the same money men are now. 
[01:25:30]  Now, stop glorifying the 50s.  They sucked, and your music stunk.  A bunch of greasy-haired dummies going, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  It stunk.  God almighty, will you stop living back there?  Oh, those were the days.  Oh, they waxed fantastic.  Yeah, it stunk.  What a great time it was.  It was our age of innocence.  Yeah, really innocent.  Shut up.  Yeah, really innocent.  And it wasn't for Jackie Robinson.  Blacks would still have their own league.  Yeah, really innocent.  It was disgraceful.  The way people were treated back then.  It was a horrid, horrid time of... 
[01:26:00]  You're not a fan of the DuckTale?  Eh, no.  Bang, bang, bang, bang.  Hey, call me Mac the Night this week.  Although I love Bobby Darin.  I love the music from back then.  But it's just annoying.  Stop glorifying.  It was no different than now.  It was all hidden back then.  Now people are more open about being scumbags.  Thanks to programs like you guys have.  Thank you.  I like that.  That last thought, it makes a lot of sense.  John, what's up?  Hey, listen, guys.  Hey.  I've got a 14-year-old daughter. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  All right?  And I've got to back you guys up as far as, you know, what's going on in these schools.  I mean, their class trip, she's in 8th grade.  Their class trip was basically canceled because a teacher caught one of the girls who was younger  than her giving a BJ to a guy in the back of the bus.  There you go.  All right?  Now you've got to figure, all right?  My daughter's 14.  All right?  My wife and I, we're both, I mean, we're relatively young.  I mean, we're 38 years old, all right? 
[01:27:00]  My daughter comes to me with problems with her boyfriend.  I come right out and tell her.  I say, listen, guys are scum, all right?  Basically, the only reason why your ex-boyfriend wants to get back with you is because he wants  to ask you.  All right?  And then he wants to turn around and tell everyone else.  Hey, at least you're being honest because that's the bottom line back then.  No guy is looking for a long-term relationship back at that age.  I mean, nowadays, parents do not, they're not honest with their kids.  All right?  Listen, if you've got a problem, come back to me. 
[01:27:30]  I have a question, sir.  I have a question as a parent because I'm not a parent.  Sure.  Maybe this show isn't right for someone who's 13 or 14.  That's fine.  But what do you do if your daughter's watching something or whatever that you think is inappropriate?  Like, how do you deal with that?  Or say she's listening to a show that you don't think she should be listening to?  Basically, my daughter is very upfront with me, man.  All right?  I mean, anything that she doesn't feel is appropriate or, I'll give you an example.  All right?  She was over at my brother-in-law's house.  All right?  Her and her cousin, who they're both the same age, her cousin's a boy. 
[01:28:00]  All right?  It ended up that one of them went on a porn site.  All right?  My daughter came right out and she was like, Dad, I didn't do it.  All right?  Now, every father is going to say, yeah, okay, you didn't do it.  All right?  I had both of them sitting in front of me and I could see by the body language of my nephew that, yeah, obviously he was on it.  You know?  It's like, well, Jesus Christ, look me in the eye.  My daughter is looking me right in the eye saying, Dad, I didn't do it.  I swear to God, I didn't do it. 
[01:28:30]  Why would I do it?  You know?  Well, and the thing around nowadays with parents, they don't want to be straight up with their kids.  All right?  They want to treat them like babies and everything else.  Yes, they're babies until a certain age.  But then you've got to prepare them to be out there in the world.  If they're not going to be prepared to go out there, then guess what?  They don't get screwed over anyway.  They don't get knocked up when they're sick.  Hey!  Hey, potty mouth.  There you go.  Oh!  Oh!  Everything.  Let your daughter hear that language. 
[01:29:00]  They don't turn around and try to keep everything from you, and that's the worst part about it.  I mean, just for an example, my wife could not go to her parents about anything.  Absolutely anything.  All right?  My parents, they beat the hell out of me.  All right?  I don't touch my kids.  I don't need to.  I turn around and look at my 11-year-old son and say, well, you really disappointed me this time.  That's almost worse than smacking them across the head.  Thanks for the parenting lesson today, John. 
[01:29:30]  John, you know what?  John's right.  It ends with you.  We had a nice little serious discussion, but we've got to move on to the hilarity.  Hey, listen.  I love you, boys.  Good job, though, John.  You've got to take care, huh?  Good job.  Bye, John.  What?  Don't want to get too serious here.  No, no.  That's actually good.  I don't want it to come up like I don't like kids.  I do like kids, but it's just annoying.  Like, you know, I like guys like that.  We're still trying to catch up, so we're going to take another break here, and then when we get back, I swear we'll do the Nixon thing next.  It's the best story of the day. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, just in time.  We can quickly do this, if you've got like a minute or so, the unlucky lottery.  Yeah, go ahead, Ant.  Because we haven't done this in a while.  Someone sent it to me as a sucks to be you, but I dubbed this the unlucky lottery.  A survivor of Egypt's biggest train disaster, who escaped with light injuries after jumping off one of the rear carriages of the train.  You heard about this about a few days back.  There's a war.  There's a little battle going on.  So one side decided to set fire to the train of the other side. 
[01:30:30]  A bunch of Egyptians were in this train and died.  A lot of them.  I don't know what the death toll was.  Like 80 or something like that people died on this train.  In the Middle East.  Yeah, this guy survived, jumped off the train, and lived through it.  Opie, he died on his return journey by falling underneath a train.  Oh, yes.  What an ass.  Wait, how did that happen?  22-year-old laborer escaped fire eight days ago, which killed about 360 people when it swept through seven carriages of a crowded passenger train. 
[01:31:00]  So 360 people died.  He survived, jumped out.  He, after spending the Muslim festival of his family over the past weekend with his family, he was waiting at the train station to return to Cairo when he slipped and fell under a passenger train and was killed.  Who is he?  Wile E. Coyote?  But that is unlucky lottery. 
[01:31:30]  Oh!  Right?  I'm slow today!  What's the matter?  I'm mad at myself!  Oh!  Oh, the laughs, right?  I had a...  Oh!  Yeah.  I missed my opportunity.  It happens.  Ah, see, now it's...  Now it's too late.  Jim was panicking over there, going, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, laughs, laughs.  Oh!  So that I consider unlucky lottery.  Without a doubt.  If he just would have fallen under the train, sucks to be you.  Right.  If he would have died in the fire on the train, sucks to be you.  You live through that fire on the train and then die days later waiting for a train. 
[01:32:00]  Unlucky lottery.  Unlucky lottery.  Doesn't happen every day.  No.  All right, we'll go back to the dick jokes that's got Bane on the line.  Bad news.  Well, Kelly made it.  Yeah.  From Cleveland.  She's outside the studio.  We're going to throw her in a dumpster, Mike O'Brien.  In her bra and panties, Mike O'Brien.  Yep.  And she's going to wear pigtails, Mike O'Brien.  Guaranteed you're listening today, Mike O'Brien. 
[01:32:30]  You can't turn this off, Mike O'Brien.  You think this is going to drive people to throw women in dumpsters?  Let's hope.  They've been doing it for years.  It's called serial killing.  Stupid, Mike.  Because golly gee, they deserve it.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Oh, damn.  I can't even.  Well, it all depends on what they have on.  No.  The bad news, though, the girl from Philly that was going to drink the curdled milk blew us off.  She didn't call her anything.  We've been preparing the milk all day long. 
[01:33:00]  I know.  She didn't call early.  Rick finally calls her and she goes, my boyfriend says he doesn't want me doing it.  Husband?  Husband.  Whatever.  Well, you know what?  That's fine.  We don't mind that you have to, you know, you're not going to do it or whatever, but you've  got to tell us.  Yeah, let us know because it gets down to show time and we don't know until we're into the  show by a couple of hours before we know you're not going to show.  And her husband's really beginning to bug me with this because now, stupid, let her do  it and this way she'll always swallow. 
[01:33:30]  Because if she doesn't, you go, look, you can drink curdled milk, but you can't do this  and you're supposed to love me?  Dude, you just blew a great opportunity.  We really count on our listeners.  It means less work for us.  Don't let us down.  Why?  So, here's the deal.  The girl from Cleveland, if she does the dumpster thing, she's going to be in the 55-gallon  jump challenge.  Right.  Anthony, we have one spot left.  One spot.  We had the curdled milk.  Yeah.  One spot.  One spot.  Curdled.  Not two.  One.  Not zero. 
[01:34:00]  One spot.  One spot.  A lot of girls have been calling the last week or so going, I'll do anything.  Yep.  We got the milk.  We got the milk.  Yeah.  Girls.  And we have two hours left.  Two hours, girls.  Come down.  You drink this curdled milk and you're in.  You're in the 55.  You didn't throw it away, did you?  No.  Oh, good.  No, we saved it.  Could somebody with a hole just show up and drink this milk?  So, ladies, if you're close and you really want in on the challenge, there you go. 
[01:34:30]  We'll just throw that out there for you.  If you want to come by and do that, okay?  Yes.  All right.  Anything else, Rick?  You all right?  Okay.  In honor of John Madden joining Monday Night Football, Ant wrote a whole bit but left it  on the counter.  And somebody took it or ripped it up or put it in the garbage.  And it took a lot of research and, like, I can't just find that and write it again.  Dude, what kind of retard would...  Oh.  Yeah, I know.  Hey. 
[01:35:00]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  You didn't go far enough where it affects anyone else but us in the room.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Come on.  I defy anyone on Instant Feedback to even tell me what Jim was just talking about.  I guarantee they know.  All right.  Let's see.  As we go to break, what I'm saying, our good friend Frank Caliendo doing some Madden here  in honor of the Monday Night Football thing.  The Nixon tapes next.  And the basic premise of Madden is he tells you things you already know.  He's never given you any new information.  Just sitting there with the fox skadoodle, drawn circles on guys' body parts. 
[01:35:30]  He'll tell you things like, if the quarterback, if he throws the ball and the receiver catches  it in the end zone, that's going to...  That's going to...  That right there...  That's going to...  That's going to...  That's going to...  That's going to...  That's going to be a touchdown.  Wow.  Any idea is that Madden?  Nailed it.  Nailed it.  Do you ever hear him, like, Troy Aitman lost his contact lenses a couple years ago, 
[01:36:00]  and Madden's like, here's a guy who when he puts his contacts in, he can see better.  Anything else?  Here's a guy who when he runs, he goes faster.  Here's a guy who when he eats a lot, he takes a big dump later.  Madden's so ridiculous, he can drive a guy to drink it, and that explains Pat Summerall.  But Summerall's got a great voice, doesn't he?  He's got a wonderful voice.  He just does those phrases.  You know the video game, right? 
[01:36:30]  It's totally relevant or evident in the video.  Here's a guy who if he practiced more, he used the right word on the first try.  Summerall's got the great voice, you know?  He can be running, the guy's running down the field.  He can paint the picture with the language, but all he does is to the 20, to the 25, there's a flag on the plate.  Hey, if the referee, if he throws a flag and he didn't make a mistake right there, that's going to be a penalty. 
[01:37:00]  Thanks, John.  Wow.  This is my favorite thing about Madden, though, that he'll do like 35, 40 million different things and throw them into a sentence, but it doesn't make sense.  And nobody's paying attention because everybody's drunk by that time.  He's like, there's a guy, and you see him, and then you know it one time, and I saw these are the guys that won that.  And he's, sometimes, and then they're, and now you know it, that's why, and when these are ones, you know, there's a, see that, you can't tell, Michael Irvin had a crack pipe on his sideline. 
[01:37:30]  He's going to get, you know, there's a price for the helpful hardware, man.  And then you see there's a rainbow out today, the way a rainbow works.  You got the sun over here, and then there's a cloud over here, and then the rain comes down at the end of a rainbow.  There's a pot of gold and a leprechaun, and he's, do a little dance, make a little love, get down tonight, and maybe I had some of that crack.  And then Brett Favre, Brett Favre had a dog on his leg, and once your farmer had a dog, and bingo was his name, oh, I went out to spell that in third grade.  He's clapping, and I-N-G-O, the dog was licking him, he's got a rash here, if he wants to get rid of it. 
[01:38:00]  Tough acting to an actor, he'll get rid of it.  He doesn't even last the whole bit.  That's what I'm talking about.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh my God, what is she doing?  She's hyperventilating.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And EW.  And we're back.  The Friday edition of the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Paul Mercurio's here.  And he brought his Emmy.  Oh, he did, did he?  We're going to have some fun with that.  How about that?  Really fast.  Mike from Philly.  Want to comment about that douche in Sacramento writing that article?  Yeah.  Hey, I'm a 40-year-old father of a 13-year-old daughter.  I'm also an art photographer. 
[01:39:00]  Oh.  I shoot female news.  Oh.  And have been for over 18 years.  My daughter has grown up seeing my work and is well adjusted.  It all comes down to communication and how you talk to your kids.  That a-hole wants society to be his kid's parent.  It's his responsibility, not society's.  Talk to your kids.  You have a great show and Norton is a pisser.  Don't do drugs.  Stay in school.  Don't be a fool, kid. 
[01:39:30]  Have you heard what WAF is doing?  A stupid commercial with Anthony saying crap about WBCN.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Yeah, I guess people think that I'm actually bad-mouthing BCN now.  As opposed to when they were our arch enemy when we were broadcasting on AAF.  What are you, stupid?  Go ahead.  Play whatever you want.  That's a desperate move by our old station in Boston.  Play our voice. 
[01:40:00]  Like, people are going to listen to AAF.  Hear an old clip of me bashing the station we were paid to dismantle at the time.  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead.  Of course we were tearing BCN an ass.  That was our job, and we did a great job of it.  Too bad you were too stupid to hold on to us, and you lost us.  And now you're the enemy, and we bash you.  That's how it works.  Jack off.  So that's why there is audio of us tearing apart BCN. 
[01:40:30]  Because they were the ass wives back then.  How desperate are they that they're running those commercials now?  That's the best they can do to fight back?  Do you honestly think a listener's going to go,  What?  How come they're bashing, but aren't they on the...  Why are they saying bad things about BCN?  Yeah, there's plenty of old tape of us bashing BCN.  It was our mission and our job to destroy that station.  And now our mission is to destroy you!  To destroy you.  See how it works? 
[01:41:00]  See how it works?  We also used to say how cool AAF was.  Right.  Guess what?  It's not cool anymore.  You won't hear that anymore either.  You won't hear us bash BCN because we're on there.  And you won't hear us talk nicely about AAF.  Because now you guys are the douchebags that are going to die.  There was a day when AAF was very cool.  But all the people that made it cool are long gone, aren't they?  Gone.  Gone.  The places just left...  And why?  Because you didn't take care of any of us.  Left with ass wipes.  And play all the tapes of my voice, of Opie's voice. 
[01:41:30]  Play all of it you want.  I love it.  Play me on your friggin' radio show.  Play Opie.  Play us together.  Have us talking about how we hate Nick Carter.  And how we hate Oedipus.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  It's a whole new story.  You know where we get a lot of cars from now?  Japan.  Jack-offs.  We nuked them at one point.  You move on. 
[01:42:00]  Right?  You make friends and alliances with former enemies.  And then turn around and bash, bash the people and the places you came from.  Bash the real enemy.  The true enemy.  That fat load of crap that sits in that chair and does nothing from 3 to 7 over there.  That waste of space.  This program director, Dave Dickless, that is so desperate, he has now decided to reach 
[01:42:30]  into the...  Oh, I couldn't see that meeting.  I think we have audio of Opie and Anthony bad-mouthing BCN.  Yeah, Dave, put it on!  Our stupid listeners believe that I'm actually walking away from a wedding and that I actually  picked my sidekick from a baseball game.  So, yeah, they'll believe that it's actually ONA bad-mouthing BCN now.  Wrong.  The truth of the matter is, if you really look at it, schlock hole, dick bag, and Dave ass 
[01:43:00]  wipe, you're losing horribly.  Honestly, we're kicking your ass and there's nothing you could do about it.  Just like there was nothing BCN could do about it when we were bashing them.  Yeah, so play the tape.  Play the tape.  Play how ruthless we were to BCN because that's exactly what we're doing to you now and you're  losing the battle, Tubbo.  You're losing.  To play it all you want, I love it. 
[01:43:30]  Hey, I got a tape I want to play now.  No, I play tape for you.  Good for you.  Good for you.  I play tape for you now.  We do things.  Like dinosaurs.  When men were dinosaurs.  We do things.  We do the old way.  And you got to see the awful face that comes with that.  He's been making me laugh with that one for a year. 
[01:44:00]  Is it really a horrible face?  Oh yeah, off stage, yeah.  I got a tape, Anthony.  If they want to play tapes, we'll play tape.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Well, we got actual audio of Dave Dickless, our old boss that didn't appreciate it.  Oh, great.  Remember the day we were doing some gay stuff?  Uh-huh.  This is one of many reasons why we are no longer at AF.  Uh-huh.  They didn't get it.  So we were doing some gay humor, Jim.  Oh, I hope that's you just making that up now. 
[01:44:30]  And Dave thought he could just hotline us.  They call it hotlining in the business.  Yeah.  And say, guys, I want you to stop because you're going into the gay zone.  This is his actual phone call to us.  So yeah, we took that, really took it to heart and took it seriously and understood if we listened to Dave, we'd be such a success like Rocco is right now.  Keep listening to him, failure.  Can you imagine Jeremy hotlining us?  Oh my God.  If you ever did that, I'd go down the hall and fist him. 
[01:45:00]  And now the phone's just going to ring him.  Right in the face, right?  Right, Opie?  Right in the face.  Yes.  Exactly.  There's the light.  See, Dave.  Jeremy, no offense.  I was just trying to make a point.  See, Dave decided to hotline us and we recorded it and really took it to heart what he said because then we put it to music and made him seem like a bigger buffoon than he really is.  Keep playing our frigging tapes.  Check this out.  I got tape too.  Hello.  Hello.  What's up?  Hello.  I just wanted to.  Why are you on this line? 
[01:45:30]  Well, I figured it was easier than getting out of my chair and coming down the hall.  Oh.  Just wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show in a little different direction so that this doesn't get out of hand.  What's getting out of hand?  Well, I think we're going into the gay zone and we all know where that leads.  Wouldn't you agree?  Not really.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  No, no.  Licky licky.  That's fun stuff. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, it's fun.  But you know what?  It's going to get us in trouble.  But just, you know, steer somewhere else.  If you keep going this direction, it's going to be trouble.  I'm just warning you.  Not from me.  I'm talking about outside.  We've been down this road before.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  Just giving you a little heads up here.  All right.  Okay.  Head.  See you.  We're making you a little GREEN.  But now you're going into the gay zone.  Hello.  Going into the gay zone.  Wouldn't you agree?  Going into the gay zone. 
[01:46:30]  Going into the gay zone.  Wanted to, you know.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Huh.  Gaze.  Gaze.  Gaze all.  You know.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Licky licky.  Licky licky.  Licky licky.  The old dirt road, we do want to get you home  Yeah, licky, licky  The old dirt road  Licky, licky  We'll do pokey pokey in the butt  That's fun  Going into the gay zone  Yeah, going into the gay zone  Not really  Going into the gay zone  Want to do the pokey pokey in the butt 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, pokey pokey in the butt  Yeah, gays, gays, gays on  Pokey pokey in the butt  From me, pokey pokey in the butt  From me, licky, licky, licky, licky, lick, lick, lick  Pokey pokey in the butt  Yeah, licky, licky  Yeah, it's fun  Licky, licky, yeah, it's fun.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  Really?  Da, da, Dave Dickless.  What a moron.  We're under your skin and there's nothing, nothing you can do about it. 
[01:47:30]  That really, that was really what our show was all about.  Dave really understood it.  Don't talk about the, oh, we're going into the gay zone.  Well, you know how that goes.  No.  Yeah, same guy that didn't understand wow, which is now a huge phenomenon across America.  At least now he has a vision and somebody to use like Schlocko to get his type, his brand of humor out there.  Phony, fake radio weddings, phony bachelor parties, phony, fake choosing your sidekick bits. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, that's the fun, entertaining Nebraska radio that Dave Dickless is known for.  You know, he didn't understand wow, Jim.  Yep, and we were forced.  Wanted to just stop it.  We were forced to stop because at that time, you know, it was either that or get fired.  What was the basis to stop on it?  For what?  They didn't like it.  He didn't think it was good.  Was it dating women?  You know, I have kids.  And pretty much as I saw it, Dave's wife ran the goddamn station. 
[01:48:30]  He'd go home and from the little hints I got, I always felt that she would then tell him what she didn't like about what she heard on his station that he ran.  And he would have to come in and then tell us what we should or shouldn't be doing based on what his wife thought.  So just roll as much Opie and Anthony tape as you possibly can on your crappy, soon-to-be-a-one-share radio station. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, we're in one-share right here in New York?  Yeah.  But we're an island.  Right, we're the island.  And we're working on things.  We understand that.  No, you do it.  You keep rolling our tape.  That's a desperate move, ain't it?  What kind of guy doesn't get, wow, it's not a national phenomenon.  If you get it on the job every week now.  Yeah, that's great.  And he didn't get it.  You know something?  I'll do him a favor.  Dave, schlock, douche. 
[01:49:30]  If you can't find any quality, fun audio of Opie and Anthony from when we were there, we'll send you some new stuff.  Send us a copy.  We'll read it and send you tapes that you could play on your station of Opie and Anthony.  Since you're so desperate and have such belief in your afternoon show that's there now,  that you just want Opie and Anthony back somehow, someway on your station.  So instead of playing the old tapes, we'll gladly read your copy and you can play our voices on your show and on your station. 
[01:50:00]  All right?  All right.  Good.  Dan, what's going on?  Dan.  Yo.  What's up, Dan?  Tools, what's up?  Hey, Dan.  Hey, I just want to imitate Dave Dickless' bitch moaning after he sees the ratings coming out the next bookin'.  All right, let's go.  All right.  Rockhole, you're going to have to find another job. 
[01:50:30]  I think.  All right.  Is this the latest?  Go to Mike down there on line six.  Is this the latest fake, phony, please, if you believe this guy, shoot yourself in the frigging head radio bit.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What's your, what wacky phoniness is he up to now?  Oh, yeah.  Rockhole and fatty are up to their funniest cancer bits.  Yeah.  And they've got the illegitimate son calling from Florida that Rockhole supposedly screwed this chick in Florida on spring break. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  And look, I'm your son.  Is that one new or what?  Oh, so now he's got a kid calling like, hey, I'm your son.  And what does he do?  Hey, you're not my kid.  Tell me.  Hey, it wasn't me.  Tell me he's getting bid ideas from Ally McBeal.  Oh, is that what it is?  Hey.  Well, hey, I want to say I love you guys.  So what is he like?  Hey, I'm not your father.  I'm not your father, man. 
[01:51:30]  I'm not paying child support.  I got a kid.  You tell that bitch of a mother of yours.  Put that bitch.  You should have swallowed.  They got this kid calling and he's supposedly five years old and he's using big words like available.  It's like, you know, this isn't real.  There is no fake.  There is no bit.  There is no kid.  There's no illegitimate kid.  It's all fake radio, like the wedding, like everything else.  Dave Dickless puts together. 
[01:52:00]  They even added down to things like the ticket giveaways.  Hey, I broke into Dave's office and I stole the tickets to this show.  And we'll be giving them away all week at five.  How about the wedding?  Were you guys around when they did the wedding?  No, I saw a video of it.  Someone sent me.  It could.  I'll give him a compliment.  Could be the funniest video I've ever seen in a completely different way than they meant it.  When you watch it and realize how phony and stupid it is, it's hilarious to look at.  And they made a whole TV show about it. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  That's good.  Made a whole real rock TV show.  So just in case they didn't know how fake it was on the radio, they could see for themselves with the visual.  All of a sudden, they're actors.  You know, they're supposed to pull off things.  You know, you have Dave Dickless talking to Rocco about, you should go back in there.  What is it?  Days of Our Lives?  There's soap opera over there.  You should go back in there.  No, Dave.  She's a whore.  I'm not going to.  Oh, we're all believing this.  I want to say you guys are great and I missed you while I couldn't listen to you in Boston. 
[01:53:00]  Well, we're back and we're taking our tools and we're slamming them up their A's.  Mike, you can thank Dave Dickless for us not being around for a while.  There you go.  I'll thank him personally.  There you go.  Great.  Steal tickets and pretend to steal tickets?  Yeah.  Like, you know, there'll be tickets to give away.  And Dave Dickless and Schlocko get together and Dave goes,  Oh, why don't you say you broke into my office and come off like a real rebel? 
[01:53:30]  All right.  Yeah.  I'll say like you were gone and I broke in and stole them.  And if you stole something, what would you do?  Yeah.  You'd spend a week giving them away and have a whole promo made up.  Like you wouldn't just get fired or, no, I'm too cool and tough for that.  Like people would actually believe that like somebody would steal tickets.  No one's believing it.  No one's believing it.  They had no choice because everything else up there sucked.  That's brutal.  We're back.  We're on BCN and they're being dismantled now over there and they're desperate. 
[01:54:00]  So they're playing old Opie and Anthony clips.  Ain't going to work.  I'm sorry.  Have fun, though.  All right.  Tracy, the curdled milk girl from Philly.  What does she call him back for?  Tracy.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Um, can I come in on Monday?  Well, what?  Are you going to blow us off Monday, too?  No, I will not blow you off Monday.  Tracy, we thought we got along with you.  What happened?  You were supposed to be here today.  It's my husband.  You were supposed to be the showstopper today. 
[01:54:30]  Just let me be the showstopper Monday.  Baby talk.  Please.  All right.  We'll give you one last chance.  I'm telling you, the man is trying to keep me down.  You know?  It's curdled milk.  This is a good bit.  We don't want to get this bit to go to waste, Jimmy.  I agree.  Yes, Rick?  And just for added flavor, we're going to let it sit over the weekend on a heater.  Okay, cool.  That's your punishment.  Okay.  By the time you get here on Monday, it's going to look like a Friendly's Fribble. 
[01:55:00]  Fennach.  Oh, God.  Dude.  But it ain't going to taste like that.  I drank curdled, sour, like a vanilla milkshake thing once and just vomited for hours.  And all I did was take one huge gulp of it.  It was one of those, remember those old Borden vanilla, vanilla, Borden vanilla shakes?  Oh, boys, I got an idea.  Some vanilla shake.  Not the chocolate ones.  Those are with the shugies.  I got an idea. 
[01:55:30]  Boys, I have an idea.  Meet me at the chinky restaurant.  Boys, I can't believe I'm now getting fired and Dave Dichliss won't support me either.  Boys.  I was the one who got them out of Nebraska.  Nebraska.  Boys.  I drank one of those Borden's vanilla shakes.  It was in a little can.  You shake it up.  Popped the top.  And I went, why?  And I choked half of it down and then realized at that point it was completely curdled, soured, lumpy. 
[01:56:00]  Tracy?  Yeah.  And I vomited for hours after that happened.  Are you hearing this, Tracy?  Yeah, I'm hearing this.  All right.  Well, we're going to let the milk sit until Monday.  That's your punishment.  Okay.  All right?  All right.  All right.  We'll see you Monday.  Hold on for Rick.  You better come in.  Hey, Anthony, Richard Nixon is in the news. 
[01:56:30]  Yes.  And we'll talk about it.  Oh.  These people are going to hang us.  Dude.  Yes, Jim.  He's talking about the Nixon thing and not...  What?  Got to it.  What?  What the hell?  Do we have to take a break?  Well, the tapes were released.  Yeah, they're playing them all over CNN.  From 1972. 
[01:57:00]  Everyone remembers the Nixon tapes from Watergate, that eight-minute gap and all the controversy of that.  And it turned out, it came out that Nixon had taped like every minute of him in the White House.  He had secret microphones.  This guy was one of the most paranoid, scared of communism, anti-Semite.  He was a racist, a very bigoted man.  And he was, quite frankly, the most insane president we ever had. 
[01:57:30]  And Ben Stein wrote for him.  Ben Stein.  Ben Stein.  His father and himself, Ben Stein's father and Ben Stein, were speechwriters for Dick Nixon.  And Dick Nixon was one of the biggest anti-Semites ever.  Yet, Ben Stein got pissed at us because he thought I made a Jewish slur once.  A little bit of hypocrisy there.  I bet if we cut Ben a check, he wouldn't have gotten as upset. 
[01:58:00]  But for some reason, he could hang around while Tricky Dick was like,  Ben, I need a speech.  I need a speech about how the peace talks are going in Nam.  Write something.  Write something clever.  I know you Jews can be clever and crafty.  Write something that covers up the truth.  You Jews are good liars.  It's a bunch of tapes came out. 
[01:58:30]  And it's everything from him defending women being groped to faking of napalm photos to the kicker.  Man, I love this one.  Nixon was fixing to nuke Vietnam.  Groovy.  Groovy.  Let me smoke a joint, then we'll drop the big one.  And what did Kissinger say? 
[01:59:00]  I don't think that's a good idea.  Maybe we...  Shut up, you Jaime.  I'm the president.  President anti-Semite.  Yeah.  In 72.  Smoke up, Hank.  Smoke up and forget about everything.  When I...  Oh, that was hard. 
[01:59:30]  When I smoke up, Henry, until you talk, I almost forget you're a dirty hebe.  In 72, Kissinger and everyone else laid out his options for stepping up the war in Vietnam.  Kissinger had these proposals, like attacking power plants and docks and whatnot.  Here's what Nixon says.  He goes, I'd rather use the nuclear bomb. 
[02:00:00]  I mean, did this guy understand if we had dropped a bomb on Vietnam, China and the Soviet Union would have reamed us a new ass?  And then right when he said, I'd rather use the nuclear bomb, Henry Kissinger goes, that I think would just be too much.  Jesus, of course. 
[02:00:30]  And then Nixon goes, the nuclear bomb, does that bother you?  I just want you to think big.  Think big like your Jew knows.  And then he didn't drop the bomb, obviously, but he ordered the biggest escalation of the war since 68.  He later added that, um, I want to decimate that goddamn place. 
[02:01:00]  North Vietnam is going to get reordered.  It's about time.  It's what should have been done a long time ago.  Boy, in hindsight, the guy was absolutely right.  They should have nuked him.  Ben, Ben, get your Jew dad, Ben, and write me a speech. 
[02:01:30]  Write me something that'll get me out of trouble for nuking the little yellow slopes.  Take this down, Ben.  Now, dear gooks, I apologize for the crater that was previously your nation.  We will do everything to fill it with Coca-Cola factories and McDonald's.  Signed, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah.  Fill in the blanks, Jaime. 
[02:02:00]  Nuke it.  And then, um, at one point, uh, Nixon gets pissed at Kissinger,  because Kissinger's too concerned about civilian casualties.  He goes, I don't give a damn.  I just don't care.  They're not even human.  You ever see them with their slanty little eyes?  Slopped heads.  The guy was certifiably insane, and he was running the goddamn country. 
[02:02:30]  Then, uh, there's this little transfer that they got on tape.  72 again.  There was some problem with Nixon's ambassador to France getting roaring drunk  and groping flight attendants on a trip home from Paris.  Now, nowadays, this guy would have been gone in a second.  It would have been a huge scandal story.  But, um, they asked the president about it.  After a Jack Anderson, uh, column, 
[02:03:00]  Regal Reedus with graphic accounts of, uh,  the ambassador's behavior on the flight to Washington.  And, uh, you know what Nixon's answer was?  Look, people get drunk.  And he's feeling off the flight attendant.  People chase girls.  At the point, it is, it's a hell of a lot better for them to get drunk  than to take drugs.  And it's better to chase girls than boys.  That's what he said.  I don't like the homos.  At least he's not grabbing my f***. 
[02:03:30]  So you get a little boozed up and grab a f*** or two.  I've been known to reach over and grab a flight attendant's f*** every so often.  Oh, my God!  It keeps them on their toes.  Get me a drink or I'll put my thumb in your f*** hole.  I'm the president.  Hey, uh, Nixon, you're still in Brokaw's bed.  Brokaw.  Another liberal communist.
