<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts engaging in their typical brand of crude humor and profanity, riffing on their own behavior and a particularly pungent flatulence incident.  A significant portion of the early show is devoted to a pan flute gifted to one of the hosts by “Dr. Steve,” a recurring, eccentric gift-giver.  The hosts speculate about Dr. Steve’s motives, linking his gifts to their on-air conversations.  This leads into a tech comparison between iPhones and Samsung Galaxy S3 phones, fueled by observations about iPhone 5 availability and humorous interpretations of a Samsung commercial.  They also discuss a stargazing app, contrasting it with an astronomy book previously received from Dr. Steve. One host recounts humorous anecdotes from a recent candid camera shoot in Los Angeles, including a detailed and humorous hypothetical scenario about a meeting with Daniel Craig.  The show then shifts to the aftermath of a major storm, discussing power restoration and the resulting long gas lines, prompting a caller from Queens to confirm this issue.  The conversation further meanders into Jay Moore’s stand-up show, the hosts’ Twitter usage and blocking habits.

The show then transitions to Jimmy’s recent trip to Toronto for a show, highlighting the enthusiastic reception from "hardcore ONA fans" and sparking a discussion about the contrast between their isolated studio and the energy of live audiences in cities like LA and Chicago.  A substantial portion focuses on Jimmy’s Twitter feud with Fireman Ed, a Jets superfan, filled with offensive insults directed at the Jets’ performance and Fireman Ed himself.  The conversation abruptly pivots to General David Petraeus's resignation, his affair with Paula Broadwell, and the subsequent investigation.  The hosts make several offensive remarks about Petraeus's wife's appearance. This segues into a brief discussion of the 2012 US presidential election, the electoral college, Benghazi conspiracy theories, and the movie *Lincoln*, including Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal.  The segment concludes with calls to the "F.U. Line" and some light banter.

The next segment details the chaotic mismanagement of a listener audio jingle contest.  The hosts discover missing entries and blame the “Radio Wizard,” a superior in management.  Jimmy is dispatched to confront the Radio Wizard.  Meanwhile, recurring guest Roland delivers comedic, often nonsensical movie reviews of *Ted* and *Skyfall*. The show also touches upon a staff member's lack of a driver's license and the Jets' poor performance. They eventually play three received jingles, including a vulgar Gangnam Style parody.  The discussion then shifts to a reported Twitter feud between Don Lemon and Jonah Hill and the hosts’ desire for exotic pets in the workplace.

The broadcast continues with a rambling discussion about cats, including graphic descriptions of cat hygiene and a debate on NYC cat ownership regulations.  This segues into a critique of a poorly executed prank call from the John Jay and Rich radio show, involving a supposedly "princess party" that’s actually a stripper. The hosts analyze the awkward execution and its deceptive presentation on LiveLeak. The show then moves to a discussion about the History Channel's "The Men Who Made America," focusing on ruthless industrialists.  This sparks a heated phone call with a listener, Kenny, resulting in a contentious exchange about race and politics.  The segment concludes with Jimmy's tour announcements and Opie briefly walking out of the studio.

The final segment centers on a scheduling conflict involving a photo opportunity with Sally Field, causing Jim Norton significant frustration due to a prolonged wait.  This overlaps with a power struggle between Opie and a channel manager, Gary, who is upset about a contest that "fell through." Opie avoids Gary by repeatedly walking past him, creating a prolonged standoff before ultimately leaving the studio without speaking to Gary.  The hosts discuss Opie's avoidance strategy and Gary's reaction.  Other topics discussed include Jim Norton's upcoming advice show, a review of a previous guest ("Chuck Roast"), Eric's excessive sweating, and a lengthy discussion about Eric's upcoming show, "Bagelin with the Sex," including his choice of Sal as executive producer and the debate about including a Hurricane Sandy segment. The show concludes with Jim still waiting for his photo with Sally Field.

[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now.

[00:01:00]  O.P. and Anthony show ends. 
[00:01:30]  O.P. and Anthony show ends.  O.P. and Anthony show ends. 
[00:02:00]  O.P. and Anthony show ends. 
[00:02:30]  O.P. and Anthony show ends. 
[00:03:00]  I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m., and this is the O.P. and Anthony show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  O.P. and Anthony, O.P. and Anthony show ends.  O.P. and Anthony show ends.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second. 
[00:04:00]  Someone said we curse a lot.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So, flash you then.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stopped.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn to the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With O.P. the destroyer.  I wouldn't eat Betty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  That doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony.  The rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  Tie to these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off. 
[00:05:00]  Surprise!  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do this.  Oh, man.  Good morning, everyone.  Look at us back on.  For another week of hijinks.  On the ratio.  And shenanigans.  On the ratio. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, but wow.  Oh, man.  I forgot my pan flute at home.  Why did you bring your pan flute home?  No, I didn't bring it.  I have the flute flute.  Right.  But Dr. Steve bought me a pan flute, which was delivered over the weekend.  I was very excited.  I was dizzy and hyperventilating 10 seconds into Chariots of Fire.  It's a fucking hard-ass thing to play.  Is it cool? 
[00:06:00]  It's as cool as a Zamfir master of the pan flute flute can be.  Did you figure it out right away?  It's real hard.  It's kind of like making a sound out of a bottle.  Yeah.  You know?  Right, right.  But it's like a bunch of little ones tied together, and you've got to kind of...  It's good, because you can figure out, you know, what the sound...  Wow, mine's not that big.  Write a note for yourself.  I want to see this thing tomorrow.  Oh, man.  You know what?  Dr. Steve said I might have accidentally sent you the smaller one, and he did. 
[00:06:30]  Now I see.  I would love a huge pan flute.  Dr. Steve...  Is a weirdo.  Thank you.  I love the guy.  I've known him for years.  We've all known him for years, and I don't know what to make of this guy.  Because one time on the radio, I said, hey, I took my binoculars, and I looked at the  moon, and you could see craters.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, he sends me a book on other things you could see with your binoculars  out there in space, and I go through it.  It's all shit.  I would...  Who gives a fuck?  Dude, he's one of the nicest, most generous guys.  He is incredibly nice. 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  I would never say he's not.  And he's incredibly generous, of course.  But it's also just weird.  You know why?  Because no one's nice.  So you look at him like, what is he doing?  Why is he doing that?  But I guess you go through the book, and you can see other stars and stuff.  But I want to see Saturn.  I want to see the basic shit.  But it's all names of stars I don't care about.  You've got an app for that now.  This is Plutorious 5.  I hear it.  This was discovered in 1971 by a Dr. Oppenheimer's third cousin. 
[00:07:30]  If you look just west and south of the moon.  But it's stuff...  It's just other shit.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what I'm looking at, but this book is supposed to help you, you know, look  at shit.  But if you don't really know much about space, it's like, it's just...  It's all just nonsense to me.  I constantly have things on...  But it was nice to him.  Oh, it's fucking amazing.  The guy's the nicest guy in the world.  But I'm thinking I should come up with other stuff and talk about it on the air.  And, you know, stuff I really care about.  And then I'll be opening up some really good packages at home. 
[00:08:00]  I'm constantly getting things, like, in the mail and stuff, like, packages and things.  Right.  I like...  You know, whether it's something for a helicopter or video games and stuff, I'm constantly getting  packages.  And it's like Christmas every day at my house.  Nice.  So I get this package.  And I'm like, oh...  And I'm rolling through my head thinking what it could be.  Right.  I'm like, oh, good.  I need that in order to get this or that.  And I open it up.  I'm like, it's a pan flute. 
[00:08:30]  I'm like, oh, Dr. Steve bought me a pan flute.  Let's come up with something and just talk about it for a couple minutes today and see  if Dr. Steve gets it for us.  Yeah, yeah.  That'd be good.  He's like the guilty divorce dad.  Yeah, he is.  He just brings shit up and he tries to buy your love.  He is trying to buy our love, you fucking weirdo.  That's what it is.  How about we're just friends?  Oh, Dr. Steve.  I'm trying to buy my love.  Every note starts with, I'm sorry, I couldn't be there.  Right.  Right.  He's very thoughtful, though.  He's a very thoughtful guy.  He's so thoughtful. 
[00:09:00]  He lives in Tennessee.  He makes good money.  He's a doctor.  It's like, he's like, yeah, buy my friends little nice things.  He's a thoughtful guy.  He really is.  He's trying to buy my love.  Buy your love.  He does.  But he hears you talk about things.  Like, if I was a chick, I'd fucking love the guy.  Of course.  That's the kind of shit that, like, girls, you talk about, they talk about something.  Yeah.  And then it automatically shows up.  Right.  And they're like, you were listening.  You were listening to my God.  You remembered. 
[00:09:30]  You listened.  You remember.  That's Dr. Steve.  Yes.  He's everyone's bitch.  Yeah.  I don't even know what to do with this book you got to read.  Oh, fucking.  Well, you know what?  You read it.  You did.  I would have to, like, go down.  Put it in the toilet.  I would have to go down to Philly to read it, so.  Oh, no.  Might have passed that one.  Is it relegated to the E-Rock fucking poster category?  I might have passed that one along.  You're not supposed to announce your re-gifting.  That's the best part about re-gifting.  Make it hurt a little.  Just turn the screws. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  My father-in-law likes to look through binoculars.  I'm like, hey, I got something for you.  Hey, there you go.  So he's got it now.  I'll get it back.  I'll go down to Philly enough.  There you go.  Hanging up on a nail in his garage.  Yeah, exactly.  But I'm going through this thing, and I'm like, I don't know any of this shit, so who  cares if I see it through binoculars?  Whether it's far away or close up, it doesn't make a difference.  There's dots that are a little closer, but to, like, astronomers, it's like, oh, wow, you  can actually see this with binoculars?  That's kind of cool.  If you look into Antares, you could see what the hell. 
[00:10:30]  I can't even figure out what planets are in the sky.  You know when you wake up, well, in your case, stay up, when you wake up really early  and the sun's just starting to come up and all of a sudden you see something really  bright in the sky, you're like, I think that might be a planet.  That's got to be something.  But I don't know what planet it is, because I don't have my charts to see which planet  is visible at this time of year.  Now you just click on an app, you hold the phone up to the sky, and it superimposes all  the names on the fucking stars.  It's amazing. 
[00:11:00]  My brother that lives out east where there's not a lot of city lights, so it's really at  night when we burn our illegal fires in his backyard and have a little campfire.  The stars are ridiculous, and he has that app.  And that is cool, because you just hold it up and it's the exact thing you're looking  at.  Mine talks, too.  Yours talks?  Yeah, you roll over something and it goes, Jupiter.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah.  I wonder if his does.  It's fucking cool.  Do you have to have your location services on or something so it can tell you? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, you kind of calibrate the phone, you know, spin around a few times.  We lifted that up, and you're right, and then it points out everything you're looking  at.  It's amazing, right?  You don't need a book.  Dr. Steve should have suggested an app and paid the $1.50 for the app for me.  Beetlejuice.  Beetlejuice.  Yeah, it talks.  It's pretty fucking cool.  That is cool.  Does Danny have the app?  He's running down the hall.  You got this app.  Skyview.  Yeah, Skyview. 
[00:12:00]  Hey, that's the one.  Skyview rocks.  That's the one we were using way out east.  Yeah, fucking.  Yeah, I checked it out.  I have the camera on so we could see.  Look, we could.  There's stars over Jimmy.  Yeah, that's like if you just kept going forward, that's where the stars would be on Earth.  That is so cool.  Away from Earth.  Yeah, the horizon.  That's pretty fucking cool.  I forgot how to use this fucking thing.  Pretty badass.  I forgot how to take the goddamn overlay off.  Yeah, right on, man.  That's pretty fucking cool.  Yeah, that's like cool.  There's Jupiter.  Wow.  Jupiter.  But it doesn't, I don't get it. 
[00:12:30]  It doesn't look that big in the sky.  So why do they make the planets look so much bigger?  So you know what they are, I guess.  Yeah.  Right there at 1143.  That is fucked up.  You know what?  That just is, how the fuck do they figure that out?  It's not a phone anymore.  Let's just stop calling them phones.  No.  They're fucking tricorders, for the love of God.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I was trying to get an iPhone 5.  Try to get an Apple 5 this weekend, but they're still all out. 
[00:13:00]  Wow.  Yeah, that's cool.  Their fucking stock is going to the toilet.  They were like at a 530.  Dude.  They're going to dip below 500.  How about you have the right amount of product, you shitheads?  How about those days are over?  Here's the iPhone killer, finally.  I hold in my hand the iPhone.  The Galaxy is a rough one, man.  Finally.  The S3.  And they don't have them.  I would go get an S3 if I couldn't get an iPhone.  I would just go get a fucking Galaxy.  Exactly.  You know all the silly phones I've had over the years, which have sort of driven you guys 
[00:13:30]  crazy as you guys do your iPhones?  Remember all the times you were yelling at me like, what the fuck are you doing?  Yes.  For the first time in my life, I get stopped all the time, and people are all curious,  asking, do you like that phone?  Yeah.  And they all have iPhones.  I know, people like a little new adventure there.  This is the first phone that people have actually stopped me and said, do you like it?  People are going to start cheating on their iPhone.  I like the S3.  I like the Galaxy S3 a lot.  Do you bump it with fellow Galaxy users?  No, I haven't bumped it yet.  That's just creepy. 
[00:14:00]  I got a video for you.  Actually, I don't even know how to do that.  Communicable disease.  I don't think it really happens.  No, no.  I don't think it happens.  In the commercials, it does.  They make it seem so easy.  I don't know how to do that, and I don't have enough friends to do it with.  You see that commercial where it's implied that the woman's giving her husband a fucking  sex video?  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, she's like, Keith, don't watch this on the plane.  It's a little special.  Right.  And he's looking like, uh.  And she kind of winks at him.  All I'm thinking.  Like, the only thing I think of there is now I'm picturing her, like, doing the worst, 
[00:14:30]  filthiest things with her vagina.  Yeah.  Like, you instantly just think how bad this video can be.  She's probably shitting into her hand and scooping it into her vagina.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Oh, this is it.  See what she says.  Oh, thanks, girls.  Yeah.  The daughters are there.  The wife.  He's getting into a cab, going on a business trip.  I also made you a video.  Oh, that's so sweet.  You probably shouldn't watch it on the plane.  Whoa.  Whoa.  It's the neighbor fucking her. 
[00:15:00]  Wait, this is a real.  It's a big.  No, no.  Yes.  Make sure the color balance works.  I want you to really understand what I did here.  Yeah, you might have to adjust the contrast.  Nine and a half million views on that.  That's a good commercial.  That'll sell some phones.  It tickled my fancy.  Yeah, I thought it was.  I just instantly thought of the worst type of fucking amateur pornography I could think  of.  You know, you got two phones.  Yes, I do.  So you should go Apple 5. 
[00:15:30]  I should.  And then a Galaxy S3.  And then you could be the one that decides.  The litmus test.  Because, I mean, we got iPhones in my family that I use it every once in a while with apps  for the kid of shit.  But which one would I go to more?  And then you start realizing, oh, boy.  But someone like you, you're working every day.  That'd be a good test.  You should do it, man.  I really should.  Because I just love it, but I don't really have that much knowledge with the iPhones to  make an honest opinion on it. 
[00:16:00]  As far as Apple's concerned, no excitement over this mini.  This, like, fucking iPad mini thing.  No excitement.  No fucking lines.  No nothing.  And that's their, like, latest big thing.  The iPhone 5, yeah, I'm looking for it.  I'd like to have it.  But I wasn't clamoring to get it.  And they don't have them in the store.  And they don't have it in the store.  Which one?  The iPhone 5?  Yeah, these fucking dummies are still playing the same games they played in 2004.  Yeah, it ain't working.  People are going elsewhere. 
[00:16:30]  Those games worked for a while, but now with the Galaxy S3 as a real competitor, you can't  fuck around with that shit anymore.  They were the only game in town, so they were able to do all that shit.  Dummies.  And then, you know, making stuff smaller, then making it a little bigger, then let's  bring it back down, make it smaller again.  Yeah.  People are like, enough already.  Yep.  Let's figure out a size, and let's just all go with that.  The mini is the first time it feels like they're playing catch-up on something.  Like, they're trying to do what the competitors were doing, whereas they always set the standard  and then everybody tries to follow them.  Right. 
[00:17:00]  But the mini kind of feels like, wow, they're trying to catch up for something that they  missed that someone else was doing.  But the iPad just doesn't feel big where you want to now go, you know what, I need this  smaller.  Right.  No one has ever really thought that yet.  No, between the phone and the iPad is fine.  There was no need for something in between those things.  The iPad's good, you're home, you're fucking cruising around the iPad, dude, and then you're  out, you have your phone.  When I'm traveling, I don't think, oh God, I wish my iPad was smaller.  It doesn't even cross my mind.  Because it's not something, even the mini's nothing, you can't put it in your pocket. 
[00:17:30]  It's nothing that you can carry like an iPhone.  You're still, it still falls into the category of the iPad.  iPad.  So what's the difference?  Like, why would you get that instead of just having an iPad?  What do they like it for?  You can fit it in your purse.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, but not enough that they have long lines or anything.  I think they did have...  I'm not saying it's...  Yeah, to have an iPad that's a little smaller is kind of cool, but it's not something that  everyone's going to run out and get right away.  You're a fanboy.  People are waiting for them, and they are sold out. 
[00:18:00]  I mean...  Of course they are!  Of course they are!  Because they don't fucking make enough!  No, but...  They understock on purpose.  But the lines were nothing like they were for, you know, past Apple products.  They're always sold.  It's gotten to a point where it just makes me not want to buy Apple products, because  I'm not enough already with a month later, you still don't have your shit, go fuck yourself.  I'd rather get...  I've been thinking about getting a Galaxy instead of the iPhone 5.  I'm so irritated with the way they're doing stuff.  It's like, why would I continue to do this when the Galaxy has a phone that's obviously  just as good? 
[00:18:30]  I kind of like the...  What is it called?  The Galaxy or the Samsung Note?  Yeah.  Is that the iPad?  Is that the iPad?  I've seen a few of them.  It's a giant phone.  It's a giant phone, but it still fits in your back pocket.  Not really.  And you've got to use a Bluetooth.  You can't hold it up to your head if you're going to make a phone call on it.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Well, you look like an idiot.  I don't know that.  Yeah, I've seen...  There's some guy down the hall who has one.  He looks like an idiot.  Yeah, he's like...  He's like he likes it, but the only thing is he always has to have a Bluetooth headset on.  Oh, God, what year is this?  Because you do, it's the size of the whole side of your head, so you look like an idiot 
[00:19:00]  with it plastered up to your face.  That just means your tumor is going to be a lot better.  Right.  Yeah.  We're all going to get the tumors from our phones, but...  But no one calls, so you're going to get, what, a hand tumor?  Yeah, man.  My phone...  My testicular.  Oh, right.  In your pocket.  My phone rarely rings.  It's all about just texting.  Yeah.  Yeah, I hate when I get a call.  Everyone knows that.  When you hear a phone ring now around you even, isn't it starting to become strange?  You're like, what, someone's actually making a phone call?  Why would someone do that? 
[00:19:30]  Right.  Bobby fucks me up all the time because he calls me right after I tweet.  So, yeah.  He doesn't text, he calls.  I know, I hate that.  He calls, like, right after I tweet, too.  He goes, dude, I know you're fucking right there.  You got your phone in your hand.  I know it.  You guys are blowing it.  If you don't have a voicemail set up, it makes the game a lot easier.  You could completely control the game.  No, I like the voicemail because I love when it gets sent to voicemail.  Nope.  It's like, fuck you.  There it is.  Because then, like, Vos will be like, fuck, will you just fucking answer your phone? 
[00:20:00]  Nope.  I can't even leave a message.  Nope.  You're like, sorry, missed the call.  I didn't even know.  Sorry.  Should have left a message.  I can't leave a message.  I haven't had a voicemail in years.  It's nice.  I hate fucking calls.  Nice and clean.  There isn't a talk.  It does teach people to text.  It disciplines you.  Yes.  It's nice and clean.  I don't have a whole list of voicemails that I get back to.  Because you wouldn't listen to them.  They'd just be stocking up anyway.  No, because if someone calls and they can't leave a message, if it's really important,  guess what I'm getting very soon after the phone call? 
[00:20:30]  A text message.  And then I can quickly write them back.  Yeah.  Except you can't.  Do you really?  So if somebody calls you and you skip the call and then they don't leave a voicemail,  will you text them back immediately?  No, I'll wait for them to text me.  No, I mean, but like.  And they text you, right?  Oh, yeah.  So they'll know that you have your phone call.  Exactly.  They kind of get mad.  There's no fucking.  It's not the old days.  They know you have that.  Oh, I know why I don't have friends.  I'm not stupid.  You choose to live your life a certain way.  Yes.  And if people want to oblige by those rules, they can.  If you want to follow the rules of the opster, the opster's rule, then I'll be your pal. 
[00:21:00]  I don't take no calls either, though.  There's no reason.  Voss and Bonnie's movie went over really well.  Did it?  I'm getting reports.  Yeah.  Yes, really well.  At Caroline's this past Saturday, they premiered Women Aren't Funny, or Are Women Funny, or  Whatever the Fuck.  Are Women Funny?  Yeah.  I want a fucking copy.  They'll give you a copy, but the people that were there fucking were laughing the entire  time.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They got a definite hit on their hands. 
[00:21:30]  Nice.  Nice.  I'm very happy for those two, because I know they put all their money into it.  Oh, yeah.  Into it.  Their life savings.  Oh, here's the thing.  Which is good.  Good for him.  Good for him.  I went back and forth to LA in two days.  Jimmy, I don't know how you do that shit.  I don't know how you do that shit.  Yeah.  I like it, actually.  I enjoy it.  It keeps me feeling active.  Like I'm doing something.  I feel so active.  I was in LA for maybe, what would it be? 
[00:22:00]  Not even 36 hours.  Friday afternoon, you went to Sunday morning.  Yeah.  Like a rock star.  Yeah, I was a rock star.  Yeah.  You didn't like the hotel?  Yeah.  Well, they put me in downtown LA.  I'm more of a Sunset Boulevard type of guy.  I love it way up there, or down near Venice, or Pacific Palisades, all that shit.  Those are where my people are.  I don't know when he went downtown.  It's in the middle of nowhere.  I've never stayed downtown.  It's creepy.  There's nothing going on.  The whole city shuts down Friday at five o'clock, and then it's like the dregs of society 
[00:22:30]  wandering around, which was kind of neat and cool to check out.  I love that shit, but.  And the hotel is all right.  So they had you down, because you were shooting down there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, for kind of a candid camera type show.  I directed one of the episodes.  It was fun.  It was fun?  Yeah, I had a blast.  We'll see how it turns out.  I texted him up at like three o'clock on Saturday, like his time, three o'clock, six o'clock.  It's like, hey, I hope LA's going good.  And you're like, we're still waiting to shoot. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  And it's like, fuck it.  That's all it is when you're shooting something.  It's like 90% just fucking waiting for them to go, okay, we need you.  I shot for five hours on Saturday.  My segment is four and a half minutes, and I'll be on camera maybe a minute.  Wow.  So I was, yeah, a 36-hour trip back and forth to LA, five hours of shooting.  For a minute of screen time.  Probably.  Yeah.  It's sort of like parked with civilians.  So I'm the guy, like, kind of behind the screens, you know, like, telling some of the  actors what to do and shit.  Do you get to run out at the end? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  And be like, the opster gotcha!  Oh, yeah.  The director, at one point, we did five, five marks.  They'll only use maybe one or two.  But one, like, the guy was in such a panic, I just waited.  And the director actually told me, I don't know if you want to make it hurt as much as  you just did.  Oh, really?  I didn't let him off the hook fast enough.  Because they're used to, like, TV, where, like, you're thinking of making sure that people  don't think you're a bad person.  Oh, no.  Like, it's all good fun. 
[00:24:00]  Every time I see those shows, I'm thinking, why the fuck did they run in now?  The guy's just starting to get panicky.  I come in as I'm, like, part of, like, in my case, sort of the feds.  Like, I'm the boss of the guys that are killing them.  And this guy was panicking so much, I'm like, are you the guy?  Are you the guy?  And he's just looking at me, and he's just praying that there's a spin here.  Oh, man.  And I just fucking, I fucking just relaxed in the moment and enjoyed the fact that he  was ready to shit his pants.  And then the director's like, I don't know, we might want to let him off talk a little 
[00:24:30]  faster.  No!  I will see how it turns out.  It was fun, though.  How refreshing was it that you showed up and it wasn't all, like, staged?  Because you know how we always think most of those reality shows are fake?  No, it wasn't staged at all.  That's good.  I thought I was going to be the joke.  I thought that was the spin.  Because they didn't give me much direction going into this thing.  I'm like, damn, something is fishy.  But it turns out they're just unorganized like everybody else.  Like everybody else.  Like our show and everyone else's shows.  You think other shows that are out there are well polished and ready to go? 
[00:25:00]  Nah.  It's the same shit.  Especially like TV.  You think like TV, everything's been scripted out months in advance to the minute.  Every dollar accounted for.  We know exactly what's going on.  But then you just get there and we're like, we're going to pretend you're a cop.  It was fun, man.  I like doing side shit and that's more my thing instead of going on Fox like Sean Hannity wants me to do.  Faux news, man.  I ran into an accordion guy.  It's on my Instagram.  And then the hottest pigeon lady ever I took a picture of.  And I was making a video with her and I just fucked it up, unfortunately. 
[00:25:30]  It was just really...  Look at this hot blonde.  You see her?  What's wrong with her?  She was just putting down birdseed on, I think it's called Broadway in downtown LA.  I would never recognize downtown LA, dude.  I would never recognize that.  It's awesome for people watching.  And I was walking around with this guy that Kenny sent...  Well, Chris, he's, you know...  Oh, Chris, what was your...  And the black dudes were coming up to him going, hey, officer. 
[00:26:00]  Like, they wanted him to know you're not fooling anyone.  They thought we were undercover because we were just walking up and down.  Yeah, I was pretty much the only white guy.  Well, let me tell you something.  As far as looking like a cop goes, that guy...  Looks like a cop.  The most cop-looking cop I've ever fucking seen.  Well, because I was wondering why I wasn't getting kind of, like, fucked with or getting  just even the eyes.  Because it was obvious I didn't belong in this neighborhood.  Like, you know, on a Saturday afternoon in this area, not a lot of white people.  Yeah.  Although the blonde, the hot blonde that was feeding the pigeons, but she was completely 
[00:26:30]  out of her fucking mind.  So, you know, they wanted to make sure you're not, you know, are you guys really undercover  looking like this?  Hello, officer.  Yeah, yeah.  But she was feeding the pigeons on Broadway.  There's got to be, what, almost 500 pigeons there.  Yeah, a lot of fucking pigeons.  And there's a penis on the no-parking site.  Yeah.  If you check out my Instagram pictures.  Yeah, the pigeon, bird ladies are fucking, like, cat ladies are just fucking crazy.  Yeah.  Just batshit crazy.  She was nuts, and she was getting all paranoid because I was filming her and shit. 
[00:27:00]  And I wanted to get the big shot with the 500 pigeons all leaving at once.  Yeah.  Turned off my camera, and then, of course, they all fly away, literally right after I turned  my camera off.  Fucking idiot.  I like pigeons.  Crazy bitch.  But I was lucky enough to do the sleeper seats back and forth to L.A.  Oh, that right there is key.  That's the only way to travel.  How do you sit in a coach seat like a commoner?  It's crazy.  You get used to it.  Oh, please.  I did it for many years, Sam Roberts. 
[00:27:30]  Many, many years.  Now they got economy plus.  I don't think so.  You get to treat yourself a little bit.  It's economy plus.  These seats go all the way down to a bed.  All right, maybe not treat yourself quite that much.  I told Anthony, like, you sleep a minimum of two hours each way, so when you wake up,  you're like, oh, this is only a trip to Florida.  It's not a trip to California anymore.  Just a nice little quick three-hour flight.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, you're only aware that you're flying for maybe three out of the six hours.  You get time for a movie and a nap, and then you're there.  I did see a movie.  What movie?  Ted.  Was he good?  Ted's fucking funny, man. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, I haven't seen that one yet.  Have you seen Ted yet?  No.  It's fucking funny.  The little teddy bear one.  Marky Mark.  Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane's movie.  They got a lot of fucking really edgy jokes in it.  Yeah.  Who's the chick?  Is it Mila Kunis?  I think so.  Yeah, she's ridiculously hot.  But she's an older broad now, right?  She's been around for a while.  Older broad?  She's probably 30, I'm going to guess.  She's been doing Family Guy forever.  What, did she star as a teenager?  She was a child actress. 
[00:28:30]  Really?  Yeah, that whole commercial came out recently when she's like nine years old and doing  a commercial.  Yeah.  I think.  Sure.  Sure.  She was on a TV show when she was a little kid called Nick Freno something teacher.  Oh, yeah?  I used to watch it.  He was like the cool teacher.  And I was like, oh, I wish I had Nick Freno as my teacher.  Did she launch a quarter off her ankle?  No, she didn't have talent like me.  You wish Nick Freno was your teacher?  Of course.  He was cool.  What a fag. 
[00:29:00]  I don't have any cool teachers.  Yeah.  No, I don't have anything.  I'm out of it.  I was only going to say, because I was watching a Skyfall commercial as we were talking.  It's on the...  I'm not sure if anybody saw it.  I saw it.  And saw it.  I saw it over the weekend.  What'd you think?  I liked it.  I liked that James Bond shit.  It was fucking good.  Wait, you're saying it in a way like what?  What?  Is it a good movie?  Yeah.  You said I liked it in a weird way like...  No, I'm like, I like that shit. 
[00:29:30]  But it sounded like I know others aren't liking it, but I liked it.  No, I don't think others aren't liking it.  I think it's doing pretty well.  It was just the way you said it, that's all.  Oh, no, I didn't mean anything by it.  How bummed are you that you can't post any of these pictures or videos?  Be honest.  I posted that one.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I posted a couple of the pictures.  The videos, though, they kind of get a little iffy about the videos.  Oh, then you can talk about it.  And it went shooting with Daniel Craig, man.  That's a great shot.  Yeah, it did.  It was great.  We sort of talked about it on the air a little bit.  Yeah.  It was fucking fun.  Is he British? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, he's very British.  Oh, he is?  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Why was he on Long Island?  He wasn't filming Skyfall, was he?  No.  No.  He had some business.  Yeah.  A little business.  And then Ann ends up, you spend what, pretty much the afternoon with him?  Yeah.  Hung out, went shooting, a couple of beers at the house.  How weird is that, being just a Long Island guy, that all of a sudden he's in your house  drinking beers with you?  Yeah, it's fucking James Bond.  If you said, would you blow me, would you?  I mean, it's Bond, though.  I know.  You know, you've got to take that into consideration.  But not my type. 
[00:30:30]  Not my fucking type.  What if that turned?  What if the beer drinking turned into?  Jesus.  Why does it always have to go that way?  That's how we are.  I don't know.  What if he just, you know?  I don't think so.  He's got very big biceps.  I was just noticing that.  He's a well-built guy.  He's in shape.  He gets in shape for the movies.  How does he look with his shirt off?  Well, I didn't see him with his shirt off in person.  Did you enjoy when he came out of your pool all wet? 
[00:31:00]  Didn't come out of the pool.  Glistening.  In his James Bond swimsuit.  No.  That's if he went swimming in your pool in his James Bond swimsuit.  How quickly would the afternoon have ended if you had been like, you're just sitting at  the bar, and then you just looked at him and said, so did you bring the bathing suit?  Well, if you had one for me, do you want to put this on?  Go for a dip.  Like Fast Times at Ridgemont High with Damone.  I'd just hold it up.  These will fit you.  Let's really break this down for a second. 
[00:31:30]  No, we don't.  Why?  You guys went shooting all day, and then you had a few beers in your basement at the compound.  What would it have taken for you to tell Daniel Craig he has to leave?  Oh, that's a good one.  All right?  Like, the beers were cool.  The conversation was cool.  I don't know.  What if he said, hey, I saw a pool out there, and unfortunately, I don't have my swim  trunks, so I'm going to have to go in naked.  Is that okay with you?  Well, you, the rules of the compound are, if you don't have a bathing suit, you've said  it many times.  What would it take, though, where it gets so weird and awkward, you actually have to go? 
[00:32:00]  I got some fucking extra swim trunks for guests here, so, you know.  Yeah, but what if he put them on, and then he jumped in the pool, and then he got out  and went, oh, they slipped off.  Why are you saying this?  And he has a big, it's a what if.  He has a big 007 boner at that point.  Well, we pulled back his foreskin, and he went, look what we can hide in here, look.  He's trying to show you that we can hide little things between the head and the skin.  You guys are assholes.  Where you literally go, look, you have to fucking go. 
[00:32:30]  I don't give a fuck you're the new Bond.  Well, if.  You got to get the hell out of here.  If things got at all gay, I would have to tell him to leave, because that's not my bag, man.  But if it's a little gay, it's James Bond.  I'm thinking in your head, you're like, you know what?  It's James Bond.  I don't think, I don't think everyone's going to fault me here.  That was actually an issue with the movie.  He said there won't, you know, he doesn't think there would be a gay Bond, and there are some  scenes in the new Bond movie where the villain, what's his name there? 
[00:33:00]  He's fucking.  Javier Bardem?  Yeah.  He's fucking such a good, bad guy.  He's great.  Where he kind of alludes to the fact that he might be attracted to James.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  There's one scene like that.  It's pretty funny.  That could have been you.  So what happens if you're both, if you're in the hot tub, but you're just hanging, you're  drinking.  But he still has his swim trunks on, but it's obvious that he's a bit turgid as he gets out 
[00:33:30]  to find his towel.  The bubbles are on, and then all of a sudden you realize that his bathing suit is floating  off to the sky somewhere else.  Sam has this whole fantasy where he just can't keep that bathing suit on.  Well, why would he?  He's James Bond.  Well, what if his balls and cock wouldn't fit in the suit?  Like when he sat up, it was just ball coming out one end and cock out of the other end.  You know, you guys really know how to fuck something up.  What?  This is very fucking cool.  Why else would a grown man come back to your house for a beer in the middle of the day? 
[00:34:00]  That's exactly right.  Men shooting, drink a couple of Guinness.  Kind of nice.  He'd put on board shorts, but then he'd untie them.  So they were still on, but then he'd jump out of the water real quick so the water would  push him off.  And he'd go, whoops!  Whoopsie!  Hey, you wanted it as much as I did.  Yeah, you'd finally let him into the pool house and he'd come real quick.  Did I?  Hey, this is a great shake and not stirred martini.  You know he's never coming back to your house, so I would just post a video. 
[00:34:30]  Fuck it.  You might get someone else in trouble.  You gotta have some respect.  A third party.  You gotta have some respect.  If it's a third party thing, then I fully understand.  Yeah, it's a friend of ours.  But if it's not a third party thing, I would just fucking post that.  Nah.  That'd be good.  You want to post it.  I know you do.  Well, it wouldn't.  What was he shooting that day?  You allowed to say?  A little bit of everything.  Rifle.  Oh yeah, a little bit of everything.  He was like, there's no silencer on this gun.  Oh, what are you saying? 
[00:35:00]  Aim to the tonsils.  I think Sam has gay fantasy.  He really does.  He's always done with that teacher.  The cool teacher.  Nick Frino.  Nick Frino.  It's very obvious we're trying to move on, but Sam's all in with his gay fantasy.  Of course he is.  James Bond is at your house.  It's like, whatever.  It's not gay.  It's James Bond.  I gotta go, Anthony.  I gotta go.  Roland trashed Ted so you guys ignored the movie.  Is that true?  Did he trash Ted?  I don't remember anymore.  Was the panda angry at that? 
[00:35:30]  Probably had a vendetta against somebody.  I want to know what he didn't like about Ted.  I thought it was a good fucking movie, man.  Especially when you're flying and need something to do.  You don't want Roland to get angry.  No.  Don't get the panda angry!  Nice.  I couldn't mean that.  That stinks.  I like it.  Every time I hear that, it makes me uncomfortable.  It makes me uncomfortable.  The way he yells angry is so douchey. 
[00:36:00]  Is it bad?  Yeah, it's terrible.  But now it's become a thing where now it's good.  It's kind of like an ugly celebrity.  They're so famous, you don't realize they're ugly.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's that type of thing with that.  It was a really bad production piece, but now that we've played it enough, it's just a production piece.  But you do realize they're ugly.  What happens is, it's an ugly celebrity who's so ugly that the ugliness becomes attractive.  Like Steve Buscemi.  Buscemi, who's not, you know.  Oh, is that in your gay fantasies?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:36:30]  From Fargo.  I love that face he makes.  You like him ugly?  You watch Boardwalk Empire?  Every face, he's like, hello, James.  Hello.  Oh, yeah, he does.  I know that face you're talking about.  It's not a good radio thing that the voice doesn't sound like him.  But he has this thing he does with his lip every time he's uncomfortable delivering those lines.  Yeah.  I know exactly.  That's funny.  So I was reading your Twitter and you got your power back.  Yes.  Very excited about that.  Tell me about it.  What happened?  Well, I... 
[00:37:00]  It sounds like someone got sick of all the trash and they were getting on the radio show.  Apparently so.  Because it seems like, I know the details that you'll go through, something is a little fishy.  Well, not fishy, wonderful.  Well, it's wonderful, of course.  I tell you me.  Of course.  Well, yeah, I was bitching on the air about being 10, 11 days, whatever it was, without power  because of the big super storm with LIPA out there on Long Island.  And they were having a lot of trouble getting power on to the people. 
[00:37:30]  And I was one of those people.  My entire neighborhood just had generators running.  For days on end, it was that constant search for gasoline and odd even days and trying to...  It was just a pain in the ass keeping the generator running.  And so Friday, Friday after work, I noticed there's some fucking people wandering around the yard.  Wow.  And wandering around the neighbor's yard and looking around with flashlights and stuff later on in the night. 
[00:38:00]  And a guy was climbing a pole by my backyard.  So I went out there.  I'm like, hey, what's up?  He goes, I dropped something down there.  Could you get it for me?  Yeah.  So he goes, yeah, well, your transformer's dead over here, so we're going to grab a line from there and tie you in.  He goes, don't worry about it.  We'll hook you up tonight.  I'm like, oh, cool.  And then I guess because they needed access through the Chinaman's yard, they hooked him up too.  They didn't want to hook him up. 
[00:38:30]  I guess not.  But, you know.  Please tell me you're the only guy in your neighborhood with power.  Well, put it this way.  There's a few, but not all of them.  I mean, I got neighbors where I could absolutely hear their generators running at night.  But you know what?  I don't care.  I got mine.  I got my power.  I got my power.  How long is it now?  Two weeks?  They still have generators running.  Yeah, yeah.  Two weeks today.  Generators running on my block.  I heard Cuomo's really going ballistic over LiPo. 
[00:39:00]  You know, it's easy to criticize.  It's easy to fucking cast the finger of blame.  But you know what?  These guys are working hard.  They're trying to get the power turned on.  And I even waited, you know, days.  But you got to be patient in these situations.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  You don't give a fuck about anyone that doesn't have power.  I could so give a fuck.  I don't care.  You were their leader, though.  They need you.  I got mine.  I don't have to. 
[00:39:30]  I didn't have to worry about gas or anything.  I went to go see the incredible Jay Moores at Governor's Comedy Club.  Fucking pisser.  Laugh my balls off.  It was a great time.  Jay just rips people apart.  He rips the whole audience apart because there's such fucking Long Island guineas.  Right.  And he asked if there were any black people in the audience.  There wasn't a one.  Just Long Island.  It was really good.  And then I was starting to get some texts from my contact there in LIPA. 
[00:40:00]  And I got a little progress report.  And I got one and said, hey, your power's on.  Oh, you didn't even know.  No.  You were at Jay Moores.  Yeah.  Then I went home and there it was.  There was a big fire in the living room kitchen.  Yeah.  Were you scared that something might go awry?  No.  I knew what everything was on or off or anything.  I didn't have any flooding.  Yeah.  But you were hot wiring some shit.  Yeah.  But I had the mains turned off.  So the power couldn't come through.  So you did it properly.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The power couldn't come back through the breakers.  And so I got home.  I disconnected everything that needed to be disconnected and reconnected things. 
[00:40:30]  And then I left all the extension cords and generator there and everything just in case.  And yesterday my power went out like twice for about 10 minutes each.  Oh, fuck.  And I was like, you just hear like, boof.  You power in there.  Ah!  Why?  No!  I guess they got to turn power on and off in various areas to hook things up and then  flip it back on again.  To keep it safe for the guys.  Yeah.  Up on the poles.  You know, that's fine.  I don't mind 10 minutes here and there. 
[00:41:00]  But it gets you a little nervous when you're used to having power and then it goes out  again.  But yeah, no, it came back.  I finally got to sleep in my bed after a week and a half, which was nice.  Not how to feel good.  I've been on the couch.  Ugh.  Because I, you know, I can't be left with my own thoughts.  I need a TV on.  I like sleeping on the couch every once in a while just to change it up.  I didn't mind.  It felt like a...  Not because I'm in trouble.  It felt like a bum.  It's just every once in a while just like, you know what?  I'm going to just fucking crash on the couch.  I felt like I was back in my youth when I had to sleep over at friends' houses. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  I didn't have a place to live.  But wait, why was the...  How do you sleep with the TV?  I don't get that.  I just can't do it.  It's impossible.  A lot of people need that.  Oh, I need it.  Oh, I need it.  I like it too because it fucking makes you have weird dreams.  But it just fucks up your sleep.  It has to.  No.  It has to take you out of that deep sleep all night long.  Oh, can I sleep like a champ?  No, I know.  We've all seen it.  I fucking slept because the past week and a half has been crazy, and I didn't realize  this, but I was fucking exhausted.  By Saturday, I was done. 
[00:42:00]  I fucking crashed out like late Saturday afternoon, and I woke up like Sunday morning  at 6.30 or something.  Right.  I'm never up that early.  So I started tweeting, and people were like, why did you go to sleep?  Everyone's real concerned about my fucking sleeping habits.  Blow me.  I don't care.  Whatever.  I was up.  You're still up from that night?  You should sleep.  When do you sleep?  Go to sleep.  Shut up.  They noticed that we live very different lives. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, yes.  But I was up early.  I wasn't up around the clock.  It's just going to bed, and Hopi's just getting up.  Anyone else notice this?  Anyone else noticing this?  Fuck.  I'm getting a waffle.  Oh, my God.  Oh, constantly.  You notice they live completely different lives?  Just look at their Twitter feeds.  I am a blocking motherfucker these days.  I am the king of blocking now.  These guys are announcing to their followers what you guys... 
[00:43:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, I just realized something.  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  Now I just blocked.  I love them all.  I love them all.  I've never blocked a person.  Oh, no.  I'm the last person on Twitter that has never blocked anyone.  Never.  Yep.  Not a one.  You've got record.  Not a one.  Block Island.  Didn't you invent that?  Yeah, you did.  Well, maybe.  Yeah.  The block bust.  Didn't you have all kinds of different phrases at one point?  Well, maybe.  I've had it.  No more fucking comments if I don't want to.  I'll sit there and be like, ah, yeah, fuck it.  Why am I... 
[00:43:30]  Boom.  Blocked.  And then even bad jokes now will get you blocked.  Wow.  I've had it with me.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  I've had it.  Wow.  Like someone...  I was like, ah, I saw that stupid-ass fucking commercial where, um, go where you want to  go, do what you want to do.  And it's the old, four old fucking ancient people.  And they're having a great time singing at a microphone out in public.  And then they jump in a car and they're all with their arms up in the air.  And I just tweeted, I go, old people don't do that. 
[00:44:00]  They go to diners and talk about cancer.  That's what fucking old people do, loudly.  And someone goes, so Anthony, you at the diner talking about cancer?  Blocked.  And I'm thinking, I know it was just a joke.  But the balls.  But if I write...  If I tweet something and can predict what lame, hacky jokes a fucking Twitter guy is  going to put out there, and then they do, I'm just going to block you now. 
[00:44:30]  I'm a blocking machine.  I should block every Sideshow Bob reference that comes after a photo.  Yes!  Why don't you?  All of them.  Why don't you?  My hair, apparently, it's never been pointed out before.  Oh, never.  There's a character on The Simpsons named Sideshow Bob.  And apparently, he also has an afro.  Oh.  Well, very much like yours.  Right.  And that's pointed out to me every now and then.  Constantly.  But as if it's like, hey.  Yeah, but it's not pointed out a lot.  No, no, no.  Once or twice, maybe.  Not by people who think that they're the first to make the observation. 
[00:45:00]  And they go like, all right, Sideshow Bob.  Oh, wow.  Gotcha.  Oh.  They should be talking about the dumb face you make in every...  Who was the last guy we had in here that you took a picture with that was like last  week?  Maybe, what's his name?  Roger Moore?  Yeah.  And just...  The wacky eye of the face.  He's wacky.  Well, you very astutely pointed out that I'm not comfortable taking photos to make a face.  Very astutely, yes.  Indeed.  Roger Moore was great.  Or like everybody...  Like I took a picture of myself in the mirror on Friday. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, naked.  And I was nude.  But I was holding up my phone to the mirror.  Uh-huh.  And everybody goes, oh, somebody's not wearing their wedding ring.  It's like, it's a mirror image, you idiot.  It's my right hand you're looking at.  Oh.  Oh.  You're doing self-shots now.  But why?  There's nobody there.  Why would you do that?  Jess is out of town.  Oh, for your suit.  Oh, out of town, you call it.  Yes, I cut to the college.  She left him already.  Why are you taking pictures?  She's probably fucking putting up his new J-Date profile. 
[00:46:00]  Oh.  J-Date.  Christian Mingle?  That would be hilarious.  So the power's on.  You got the power.  I got the power.  Yeah.  So that was nice.  It was finally having fucking a power in the house.  Speaking of the gas, I saw the Hess station in Manhattan down near where you used to live  there, Jimmy.  Yes.  And no lines anymore for Manhattan.  No, the lines are done.  And I had this big, huge Russian blockhead driving me from the airport to my house last night with the Harry Knuckles, one of those guys. 
[00:46:30]  I love those.  And I made the mistake of going, so how's the gas situation?  He goes, I don't wait on lines.  I go to Connecticut.  I go Connecticut.  He goes all the way up to Connecticut, a half-hour ride to get his gas.  He goes, I wait for no one.  I get my own gas.  Very good.  And we get napkins and magnetic trays.  But he says he drives 30 to 45 minutes out of his way to Connecticut, fills up, and then  comes back.  Really?  But you could just go through.  I got gas for the first time Saturday night late, and I drove through the Lincoln Tunnel 
[00:47:00]  and went into Jersey, and there was a bunch of gas.  I went to Getty.  There's a bunch of you.  I heard the Hollands.  There's like four right outside.  And I went in the Hollands.  There's no lines in any of them.  You're actually going to pay the $12 toll?  You want to wait two hours or pay the toll?  Gas lines are pretty much done.  I mean, if you're waiting on a gas line now, you just picked the wrong fucking station.  All right, good.  Yeah, even the Parkway gas station that I pass every day coming in.  That's a creepy gas station.  Yeah, but sometimes that's like the fucking, that's a savior, that station. 
[00:47:30]  What kind of deals are going on there, man?  I don't know.  That is a creepy place.  The times I've had to stop there for gas, it just feels like a lot of shady characters  wandering around there.  Doesn't bother me none.  It's a pit stop, basically.  Yeah.  You have to exit at 100 miles an hour, and you better get up to speed to about 100 miles  an hour when you get back in the parkway.  People don't know how to do that, by the way.  You got to fucking take off like a top fuel dragster right from the pump. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  Like right from the pump, you just goose it, and then by the time you're on that fucking  on-ramp, because it's a left lane entrance, so you're going into fucking hot traffic.  You're going into the fast lane.  Terrible.  And it's only two, it's two lanes there, right?  No, three.  Three.  But you're in the fastest lane.  You're on the fastest lane.  Leaving the gas station.  But you got to look.  And there's no.  I don't know.  And there's no merge, really.  Like you said, not much.  Once you run out of room, you run out of room.  Right.  You have maybe, what, a couple hundred yards, maybe? 
[00:48:30]  It's a short runway takeoff.  To figure it out.  You got to look.  You got to get up to speed and get into that traffic.  The best thing you can do on those on-ramps is be at highway speed, because it's so much  easier to adjust your speed quickly and fit in where you can than these people that they  crawl up it.  And I've seen people at the end of the fucking thing completely run out of ramp.  Now they're looking over their right shoulder to see.  And now they got to go from zero to fucking 70. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  It's the dumbest fucking thing.  Move.  We got a guy on the line, Mike in Queens.  Gas line's still two hours long.  Where?  In Queens?  I should have got the phone number of the Russian dude from yesterday.  You know what?  I wouldn't know anything about gas lines.  I don't need no fucking, like, jugs of gas anymore.  And I got, like, three quarters of a tank in the old list.  Go to Jersey at, like, one in the morning.  I'm telling you.  Go to Jersey?  Yeah, maybe.  You just spin around really quick on the GW and go back towards there.  You go to Louie's in the Bronx and you have some great Italian food in this place. 
[00:49:30]  Nice work, Lou.  But, yeah, there was nothing.  I drove in.  And any station I passed had no lines, no cars.  So two hours, you'll save yourself an hour if you do that.  Did you drive around the old neighborhood?  Just taking a little peek?  No.  I mean, I just came back home.  A little peek.  A couple circles.  See what's going on?  No.  Get your glasses broken again?  Oh!  No, no, no, no, no.  No, but I haven't driven in a while.  It was nice to be driving again.  Yeah.  How was Toronto?  I got tweets about Jimmy in Toronto saying fucking Jimmy killed it. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, it was one of the longest shows I've done in a long time.  Why?  An hour and 20 minutes.  I just, the crowd was amazing.  So you just kept going?  Yeah, and they're hardcore ONA fans, man.  Chip, Edgar, Uncle Destroy.  Oh, really?  I'll do those things once in a while when I think of it at the end.  And that fucking, holy shit, do they all, they were all, that's how I know how many real  radio fans are there.  Like, by the initial response to those.  Yeah, yeah.  And they were all fucking radio fans.  Ninety percent of them were just hardcore ONA fans.  We gotta do a Canadian trip. 
[00:50:30]  Without a doubt, we should do it.  Without a fucking doubt.  Toronto would be a good place.  We should do a trip to Canada.  Yeah.  They're great fans up there.  We're so fucking isolated in this stupid studio doing these hours.  Because when I was in LA, we have a shitload of fans.  Half the set was fans of the show.  Really?  And then I thought they were just being polite.  They weren't.  They're like, no, man.  We love the fucking show.  Look at Chicago.  That was a good indicator.  We just don't realize, because we sit here and we don't even, we don't get to perform  in front of the audience like we were doing on a daily basis at the old joint.  Oh, I remember those days. 
[00:51:00]  And you literally feel isolated in this dumb, tiny little room.  And then you go, holy fuck, yeah.  People are actually listening and enjoying this shit.  What?  You don't know after a while.  I beg to differ.  I say Canada is a place we should do a show.  We should do one farther out, farther than Midwest than Chicago.  Go all the way to the West Coast.  Figure out a cool West Coast location would be great.  I think so, too.  Not necessarily LA, maybe.  Just somewhere.  No, not LA.  I would say somewhere other than LA, definitely. 
[00:51:30]  Sacramento.  Some weird little place like that.  We always had good fans in Sacramento.  Right.  I'm babbling.  But you know what I mean.  Well, sure.  But it's just weird when you go all the way out to LA and people want to take your picture.  I'm like, LA?  Really?  Because we're so used to just the East Coast having a flat base on the East Coast.  Yes.  It was nice, though.  It was really nice to see.  I kind of do forget that we're...  But people said you were great in Toronto.  Thanks.  Yeah, it was very, very enjoyable.  I wish we had more time because of the Roger Moore interview.  I went in Friday and did a Friday night gig and came home Saturday at 7. 
[00:52:00]  But I wanted to see the CN Tower.  Just going to the gig.  Oh, my God.  You didn't go?  I couldn't.  There was no time.  Oh!  There was no time.  We got in at Friday at like 2.  But you should have made time for that.  There was no time.  Like, just fly out later.  The CN Tower's amazing.  I probably could have done that, but I had set some New York Saturday night.  And they have that glass floor shit.  I know.  Oh, creepy.  Not as good as Chicago.  I think Chicago's really perfected that.  But Toronto's an hour flight.  It's not a long...  It's a doable trip.  Dude, the CN Tower's amazing.  You can't wrap your head around how fucking tall that thing is. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Because it's not a building like the old Sears Tower.  It looks good.  It's amazing.  It's real.  And that elevator goes up outside.  That kind of free...  Thanks, Kenny.  That freaked me out.  Glass elevator all the way from the outside.  Ooh.  It's a great little thing to do when you're in Toronto.  That I don't know if I could do.  Because I was watching it as we went to the...  I'm like, those are outdoor elevators.  And I've done that in the Seattle Space Needle.  Right.  Which is scary.  I've done the Space Needle, too.  That's cool as shit, too.  But this is almost twice the height of the Space Needle. 
[00:53:00]  I know.  It's...  How much higher is it than the Sears Tower?  It's around...  It's a little...  Well, that's with the tower...  With the radio antenna.  That always counts.  But it's probably the height of the Trade Center.  I mean, or the tower itself to where your observation...  The Sears Tower is the highest you could go in North America.  I think until the New York building goes up, which I will not call a dumb Freedom Tower.  The Freedom Tower!  It's a tower of freedom!  You can see we're free in this country.  But, uh...  Look at that.  Did you go to the restaurant?  Did you go to the restaurant in there? 
[00:53:30]  There's a restaurant.  And then I think you go higher for the observation deck at the Sears Tower.  Oh, yeah.  You go all the way to the top for the Sears Tower.  I didn't go to the restaurant.  But look at that.  Look at that.  You know what?  Maybe their glass floor is better.  Maybe they redid it.  Yeah, that's pretty fucking cool.  I remember it was all scuffed up and it didn't give the proper illusion because, I don't know.  But it looks like they might have replaced the glass with something that really keeps its luster.  Wow.  Its luster.  I don't know.  That's scary in the Sears Tower to land, that glass, to look down from the... 
[00:54:00]  And you look down and you see the Sky Dome and the Sky Dome looks like, I don't know, like a quarter.  The Rogers Center, it's called.  The Rogers Center.  I think.  They changed the names of all these damn places, but we know it as the Sky Dome.  That thing is like just a...  It's amazing how tiny it looks from up there.  Yeah, I should have done that.  I just didn't have the extra day.  Oh, man.  You gotta make time for that next time.  Flying out late, I can't do it.  There's no way I could go sightseeing knowing I have a fucking flight coming up.  Oh, yeah.  What the fuck? 
[00:54:30]  I gotta go.  I wanna get through customs, and I wanna get the fuck out.  When my gig is done, literally, if they could take me with my bag still sweaty to the airport,  I would go.  I just...  Once the gig's over...  Where they keep the lights down so you could beat the traffic, you wanna be one of those  performers.  Yeah.  That's why they do that shit, by the way, if no one knows.  Yeah.  You know when you're sitting there waiting for the next encore, and the lights are drastically  dark for a while, and then they pop the lights on?  That's so the band could get the fuck out.  Could leave without any fucking...  Without any traffic.  Crowd bullshit.  Yeah.  They tool right out of there, right to the airport, some of these acts. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, man.  I should go back and do something.  We should do a radio show in Toronto.  That I think we should absolutely do.  In the spring, or Montreal.  Toronto or Montreal would be great.  I've been saying for years, we should do something from the festival.  All the comedians, we'd get every comic we wanted.  That's a no-brainer.  We really should do that.  And we should do a live event if there's an interest.  Or a live radio show in a nice, big, huge, open space, and then bring the guys through. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  I mean, there's always good acts up there.  And again, we would have access to almost all of them.  Yeah.  But look at that.  Is that the restaurant, right?  But that's the thing where they harness you to the side now, and you lean forward.  You lean forward or back?  They look like they're forward.  Oh, they are leaning forward.  It's called the skywalk.  The lean back is the skywalk.  They didn't have that when I was up there years ago.  You're tethered, and you get right on the edge outside, and you lean forward. 
[00:56:00]  So now you're leaning over the edge.  Look at that.  I would do that.  I would never do that.  I would be really fucking scared, but I would do that.  I wouldn't even do that with a parachute on.  Well, a parachute on, you're assuming you're going to fall, right?  Yeah, but just the idea.  Oh.  No, I would do that.  Oh, you can lean forward.  Yeah, that's crazy.  Oh, my God.  Would I not want to do that?  Could you please not say that?  What?  Yeah, lean forward.  Oh, Sam, somebody said, what if you fell, though?  They should, you know what they should do? 
[00:56:30]  When you're leaning forward, they should let a little slack go.  Oh, wow.  But they don't tell you.  Cha-chunk.  Yeah, give you a little ka-chunk.  Yeah, that would scare the piss out of people, quite literally.  Yeah, wow.  What is that right there, Sam?  We're looking at a picture of a guy leaning forward, but that looks like, he's like, his  feet are on the edge, and he looks like he's about to dive off.  What's holding the man up?  There's nothing holding him.  He's got a harness.  Oh, fuck that.  No way.  No, huh?  No, what if the fucking, have you heard snap? 
[00:57:00]  They never break.  That's all in your mind, but it would still freak you out.  Oh, that's so frightening.  They're up so high.  Look at that guy's right on the edge.  Oh, my.  Look at the faces of these guys.  I would just.  You want to lean forward?  I would just stand there paralyzed and wreck it for everybody.  Go, I have to go.  I have to go.  I have to go.  Take me in.  I have to go.  I got to shit.  I got to shit.  I got to shit.  I got to shit.  I got to shit.  I would take my dick out until they brought me inside.  Oh.  You'd be the guy ruining it where they have to go.  Look, could you guys wait a few minutes?  We got to freaking get this guy back inside. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Everyone's saying they have the outdoor thing where you're strapped in.  Scary.  God damn it.  I would imagine it's scary, but you would have to try it.  But, dude, that's not even a ledge.  That's like maybe a two-foot ledge.  That's not a big ledge.  Should I say ledge again?  Jesus, we got it, Jim.  Ledge ledge.  And guys jump off that shit like it's nothing.  Oh, yeah.  Like it's nothing.  They laugh at that.  That's about one one-hundredth of the height that Felix jumped from.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  He jumped from 120,000 feet.  That's a hundred times that height.  Amazing.  And when we come back, can we discuss all these dumb conspiracy theorists who really think  that the government can pull off presidential assassinations and nobody talks, and yet the  head of the CIA can't stick his dick in somebody without it getting out?  Well, even this, though, is being ballied about as a conspiracy, Jimmy.  It's not a conspiracy.  Why?  Because of fucking Benghazi?  That's what everybody's talking about is Benghazi. 
[00:58:30]  Stop it.  It's not.  Benghazi.  They're going to get all the info they need about...  What do you think?  They're not going to talk about Benghazi because he fucked this Broadwell chick?  He was supposed to testify, and now he's not.  Well, he'll testify.  Come on.  Oh, well, he wasn't...  Are you believing in the conspiracy yet?  No, I just think it's very convenient.  It might have been a payback.  Like, you know, sometimes it might be paybacks.  Like, oh, okay, scumbag.  Maybe one of those things, but not...  It's very convenient.  I just find it odd that this comes up days after the election. 
[00:59:00]  No, it was...  Oh, look at that.  It was all these things.  What happens is we all fuck chicks who don't know how to shut the fuck up, and this is exactly  what happened.  But another dumb chick wrecks everything.  Well, we'll certainly get into that and other things.  It's hard to imagine why he would cheat on his wife.  I mean, who wouldn't want to marry a woman who looks like Warren Haynes?  Jesus Christ, lady.  Fucking get in a gym.  You're married to the head of the CIA.  Four-star jet.  He's running the show in Iraq.  How about you get on a fucking treadmill?  Keep it together a little bit.  Exactly. 
[00:59:30]  He's trying to come.  She's humming forevermore.  A little PT.  I know, right?  He's in the military.  Yeah.  What's your name, fat buddy?  She's fucking private.  My new wife, sir!  That's really funny, man.  She can't fucking do anything.  We should talk about my jets and your cowboys.  I watched a little while I was in the gym yesterday doing my strenuous workout.  Was it kettlebell day?  No, but I think Saturday was kettlebell day! 
[01:00:00]  Today, for me, is kettlebell day!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kettlebells.  People have been tweeting that song a lot.  It's terrible.  You don't get to hear it in the car all the way to the gym, though.  Oh, thank God.  We're gym buddies.  Me and Jimmy.  We haven't worked out yet together.  We go our separate directions.  Yeah, I always just...  I'm doing more cardio these days.  I just go in and...  And you do the kettlebells.  Sometimes.  Talk about songs stuck in your head. 
[01:00:30]  There's a constant list of five or so rotating songs from this god-fucking show.  Get your car, the Manfredi way.  There it is.  Nice.  That one is awful.  The Manfredi way.  Come to us and you'll drive away.  With us by the Manfredi way.  There's a better way to say it.  The Manfredi way.  Tell us about it, Manfredi.  When you're ready, go to Manfredi. 
[01:01:00]  Shut up.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  When you're ready.  When you're ready, go Manfredi.  That kid is good.  Oh, God.  Also, after the break, I got myself into a little situation with Fireman Ed, the Jets superfan.  Fucking hilarious.  We talked about him on our show in the past, and there was a Twitter war between me and  him last night, and I completely kicked his ass. 
[01:01:30]  He was out of his fucking league.  We can read some of the tweets after the break, I guess.  But, you know, the superfan.  I've never liked any of those guys.  Sorry.  I hate superfans.  Sorry.  Well, I mean, really quickly, then we can get into it.  He's like, still rah, rah, rah about the Jets when fucking every Jets fan is completely  disgusted.  He's not a fair wetter fan.  So he had a tweet, and it just got ugly from there.  But it was a lot of fun last night.  It was so easy. 
[01:02:00]  It was easy pickings.  Nothing better than that.  He has a website?  Huh?  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah, he does.  I respect the fact he's a fireman.  Yeah, well, he was trying to take that angle with our little war last night.  It's like people that play the race cards.  Same thing.  It's like, I'm not fucking bashing you in any way, shape, or form about being a firefighter.  I'm not allowed to take shots at you because you're a fireman?  Put it this way.  Firefighters, cops, everyone.  They can be assholes.  There could be some assholes out there that are fucking every line of work as an asshole. 
[01:02:30]  You know what?  It's quick, so why don't we do it really fast, okay?  I was disgusted with the Jets' play because, once again, Sanchez proving, basically, at  this point, he's not even an NFL quarterback.  He stinks.  And, you know, you got the controversy with the Tebow and the Sanchez, and a lot of people  are like, you really believe Tebow's a better QB?  You know what?  At this point, yeah, I do.  That's how bad Sanchez has been this year.  And Rex Ryan's keeping him in, and the Jets fans are fucking disgusted. 
[01:03:00]  So, Fireman Ed writes, where the fuck is all this shit?  Now, how do I do this?  Hold on a minute.  So, everyone went to Twitter to bitch about the Jets.  So, Fireman Ed 42 on Twitter writes, three words say it all for me, haters.  Love my Jets.  So, I just wrote, I wrote, do ya?  I gave him a do ya.  So, then he retweets that, and he writes, stick to radio, not Jets, dopey opie. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, dopey opie.  He gave me a dopey opie, right?  He so fucking nailed you right there.  And then I write, good one.  And then I write, if you want to support a disaster, you should be in Staten Island,  silly man.  Jets stink, stink, stink.  Working off the Jets chant.  And then he basically had a tweet that I didn't even understand, something about not  knowing NFL or something, but he spelled everything wrong.  So, then I wrote, aren't you embarrassed that you're a male cheerleader that can't be 
[01:04:00]  critical of the Jets because they'll take your free tickets away?  Oh, he didn't like that.  I bet not.  He didn't like that.  So, then he wrote, now I have to go to his Twitter, sorry.  Jets.  Oh, yuck.  So, he wrote, after I wrote that, he took the fireman angle.  Oh, when I did the Staten Island thing, he goes, you know NFL joke.  Whatever that means.  So, then when I said, aren't you embarrassed that you're a male cheerleader with free Jets  tickets, he writes, you know nothing, but then again, you always put a foot in your mouth. 
[01:04:30]  Radio guy, tough guy.  And then he does this shit, FDNY firefighter, enough said.  Oh, he's playing that.  So, he's taking that angle, and I have to go back to my Twitter.  I go, ugh, I have FDNY friends, so relax with that bullshit, baby boy.  Sorry, I had to take baby boy from Jim Norton.  I have to acknowledge that.  And then I write, go wash your pom-poms and practice your shh, loser.  Because he does the shh at the stadium. 
[01:05:00]  Yuck.  And they all shush?  Yeah, yeah.  And then, that's when I completely had him.  So, then I fucking did a P.S.  I go, P.S., I'll hire you for my next kid's party.  He loves clown acts.  Whoa.  So, a little war last night with this guy.  But, you know, Jets fans are fucking ridiculously frustrated.  And, you know, Rex Ryan is stubbornly keeping Sanchez in there, even though he's not getting  the job done.  I mean, if you have a T-Bow on your team, it's obvious, why not try him at this point? 
[01:05:30]  Why not?  Yeah.  Is Sanchez a better quarterback?  Absolutely.  But he certainly has not proven that this season at all.  Is this, is this, but you think bringing on T-Bow wrecked Sanchez?  It doesn't matter.  The guy stinks.  Yeah.  He's horrendous.  And plus, if that ruins you, you shouldn't be a fucking NFL quarterback.  People are laughing at Sanchez now, how ridiculously bad he is.  It's how the fans laugh.  Dude, once again, we march down the field and he throws a fucking interception.  Interception, a horrible pass to the sideline that was easily picked off yesterday. 
[01:06:00]  He's horrible.  He panics in pressure situations.  But this guy has to be, I don't, he has to be all about the Jets no matter what.  It's like, relax.  How about it's time to be critical, fireman Ed?  Does he never criticize them?  I guess not.  You know, he's got to be the rah-rah male cheerleader for the fucking team.  Shh.  I would never listen.  I would just talk.  No.  Yeah, shut up.  Boo.  What do they do?  They all shush and then what? 
[01:06:30]  And then wait for him to start the chant because he's, you know, a male cheerleader.  What's the chant?  J-E-T-S.  Jets, Jets, Jets.  J-E-T-S.  I hate chants.  We like our team.  Yeah, our team's name.  We're all going to sing it together.  Hey, Cowboys, go wrangle them.  Shut up.  I think there's a situation, though, because obviously Rex Ryan did not want Tim Tebow on his team. 
[01:07:00]  And Woody Johnson made that call because he knew that it would bring a lot of, you know, attention to the Jets.  And he loves attention.  So I get that.  But now Rex Ryan is just looking like a fucking idiot because he just refuses to, you know, give Tim Tebow a bunch of plays in a row.  He throws them in there here and there.  And, you know, Tebow hasn't done much with his opportunity, certainly.  But the Jets just fucking suck.  What's their record? 
[01:07:30]  No, what are we now?  Three and seven.  Three and six or seven.  Three and six, I think.  Is that about right?  We've lost five out of the last six, I think.  Oh, God.  What are we?  I swear to God, I don't even know.  I hate the organization.  They just treat their, the way they, the fact that they just don't have their own stadium, that's why I have a hatred for it.  No, they do now.  This stadium is split 50-50.  They used to be like, kind of like, you know, the ugly stepbrother of the Giants in the old place.  But nobody else has to split it. 
[01:08:00]  This place is 50-50.  Okay.  It's definitely both teams' stadium now.  You always knew that the Jets were playing in Giants Stadium in the past.  There's two New York teams, they both play in Jersey.  How fucking embarrassing is that for Jersey?  Yeah.  It would be dumb to get a whole other stadium for a New York team, though, when you got, you could use, they only use the stadium eight to ten times a year, depending if they make the playoffs.  Is there another team that fucking plays in another state around the country? 
[01:08:30]  Like, is there another football team that plays that their stadium is in a different state than their fucking, their name?  But it's right over there.  Yeah, but it's a different fucking state.  It's a different state.  We technically, the only New York team we got is the Bills, technically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're in another state, you're right.  Yeah, it's another state.  All right, we should break, eat, get into some other shit.  Mm-hmm.  Let's eat something.  This fucking obsessed dummy brings down the head of the CIA. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, you fucking dummies.  Dummies.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F-Ears.  Fuck you.  I just want to give Jimmy a big hearty fuck you for it.  It's a kettlebell day.  Got this shit stuck in my head all the way to work and in the gym. 
[01:09:30]  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I walked out of my house on Wednesday and the tree fell in my neighbor's house.  You know what I say?  I said, you got a tree down in your house.  So you heard them to fuck myself.  So I told them to go fuck you.  Fuck you.  I want to give a big fuck you to all the dirty, smelly bitches at my work that refuse to wipe  their ass with toilet paper and use the toilet seat.  Fuck you, dirty bitches.  Fuck you.  Yeah, hi, this is Sal.  Um, I just want to say fuck you to myself because I'm just too big of a bitch to get my 
[01:10:00]  ass to go to work when it's sprinkling outside.  My mommy told me it wouldn't be very safe, so, you know, unless I got her walking behind  me to wipe my ass, I'm just too afraid to do anything.  Fuck you, me.  Fuck you.  Fuck you, Louis C.K.  You've made it, brother.  I watched you on Saturday Night Live tonight.  You're fucking hilarious.  And sorry to hear that, Opie and Anthony.  You know what I'm here against.  Here it goes.  Fuck you.  I want to give a fuck you to little Sammy Roberts. 
[01:10:30]  Last time I checked, this is the Opie and Anthony show, not the Opie and Anthony and  Sam Roberts show.  So, shut your fucking mouth, you fucking douchebag.  Fuck you.  What's my damn style?  Fuck you, Anarchy Radio.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I just wanted to listen to Jacktober, and now I have this stupid fucking dinosaur song  in my head all damn day.  Fuck you.  Fuck you. 
[01:11:00]  Fuck me.  All right, fuck you.  Take this out, you fucking hippopotamus.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  We should do a montage of the first things we say when these mics go on.  We should do a montage of the first things of the first thing when these mics go on.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  Because even after all these years, it's just dumb little noises. 
[01:11:30]  Ha, ha, noises.  Ha, ha, noises.  Ha, ha, noises.  Ha, ha, noises.  Ha, ha, noises.  Make sure all the tones are there.  Yeah, you got to feel it out.  Make sure all the tones are there.  Yeah, you got to feel it out.  Get some lows.  Get some highs.  Ha, ha, noises. 
[01:12:00]  How are we doing this morning? 
[01:12:30]  Let's do it.  How are we doing this morning?  How are we doing this morning? 
[01:13:00]  How are we doing this morning? 
[01:13:30]  Let the sky fall.  When we crumbles, we will stand to face it all together. 
[01:14:00]  At sky fall.  At sky fall.  At sky fall is where we start.  A thousand miles and poles apart.  Where worlds collide and days are dark. 
[01:14:30]  You may have my number.  You can take my name.  But you'll never have my heart.  Make the sky fall.  Man, she's a pig, but she's got a great voice.  Yeah.  Come back.  Huh?  She's a pig, but she's got a great voice.  Oh, my God.  She's got a great voice.  Yeah.  I still say Amy Winehouse was better if you want to compare the two, but I enjoy Amy Winehouse. 
[01:15:00]  Amy Winehouse was a bit dirtier sounding.  Yeah.  It was just kind of nice, down and dirty.  But then when Adele talks, we've done the bit, right?  Oh, what?  With that horrendous accent?  Yeah.  Like, goes really fucking south.  Yeah.  This is the big James Bond song for sky fall.  Yeah.  During the opening credits after that big action sequence.  That's their formula that they use.  Man, you just gave away part of the movie.  They had a big action sequence.  Oh, yeah.  James Bond.  I want to see this, too. 
[01:15:30]  It opens with a big action sequence.  Yeah.  I want to see it in IMAX.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  I want to go see it.  Why do movies feel like they have to do that?  We've got to start big.  Well, James Bond's kind of known for that, so they do it.  Because you've got the people for the first 15 minutes easy, so do something else.  I like that shit, though.  Fucking wild, like fucking motorcycle chase and car chase, and then fucking end up on a train.  It's fucking insane.  A lot of action.  Pretty good.  Yeah.  I couldn't get the tickets. 
[01:16:00]  I went by myself to a movie on Saturday night.  Aw.  And Skyfall was, of course, sold out.  What did you say?  I saw a flight.  Lincoln was sold out.  The time was also The Time.  Oh, God.  Is that a good movie?  It was okay.  The plane's upside down?  That's stupid.  That wasn't the push of the movie.  It was about Denzel being a drunk.  Right.  He plays an amazing alcoholic.  Denzel is a fucking amazing actor, man.  He should win an Oscar.  No, no, no.  And he already...  Oh.  Oh.  Is he as good as that fine black actor Sidney Poitier? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, I think he's probably better than Sidney Poitier, honestly.  I think he's a better actor.  A bold statement.  Yeah, Poitier was a great actor, but he was never as good as Cheadle or Denzel.  He was just the first black...  Cheadle's great.  Cheadle is a great actor.  But Denzel plays a fucking drunk.  But there's certain things about the movie I just didn't like story-wise.  I was like, ugh, right.  It just kept annoying me.  However, the acting was fucking tremendous.  Yeah.  So you could see it just for Denzel's great performance. 
[01:17:00]  Well, that's good.  And Cheadle plays his attorney, who was also good.  How many turgid penises do you get?  Oh.  Out of how many?  Out of five?  Is it a five-star system, usually?  Yeah, it's usually five dicks.  All right, five dicks.  I would give it...  Five turgid dicks.  I would give it two and a half.  Meaning a half turg?  Yeah, and I would love to give it more because, again, the acting was so good.  But John Goodman was in.  His character annoyed me and was unnecessary.  Oh, really?  John Goodman annoyed you?  Yeah, he's great, but I mean...  He's an amazing actor. 
[01:17:30]  The character annoyed me.  Okay.  It wasn't necessary.  There was a few unnecessary characters.  I'm like, what are they trying to do here?  Like, what is...  What am I supposed to get out of this?  Right.  Hmm.  Like, I just didn't give a fuck enough.  Because they kept going in these, like...  Didn't advance the story?  It didn't advance the story, and I felt like...  I don't need comic relief here.  Like, I'm not...  I don't need it.  It is stupid.  Hmm.  There's a lot of moments like that that really irritated me, and there were some great ones.  But the writing...  Zemeckis directed it.  I thought that the writing was flawed, and maybe the editing for that. 
[01:18:00]  Like, when a story comes off choppy like that, a lot of times it's the editing.  But, again, Denzel Washington is just so great.  Denzel.  But I want to see Lincoln, and Sally Field is here today in the building, and I hear she's  amazing in Lincoln.  I want to see Lincoln badly.  I've heard Daniel Day-Lewis got a little criticism for his voice.  He says that people are saying that it's a very high-pitched, kind of whiny, 14-year-old  boy voice that he's using in this movie, and people have this impression that Lincoln 
[01:18:30]  had a deep voice, because he's a very tall man, and very powerful and stuff, but I guess  some historians are saying that he did have kind of a nasally, whiny voice.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, free the slaves!  But maybe there's one asshole that didn't like him, and knew he could push that forward  for the rest of time.  There's no audio recording of him.  There isn't, right?  No.  There's not.  But are there tales of his voice, his baritone voice, reverberated through the hall? 
[01:19:00]  People, there was somebody that had seen him and written that he did have a nasal, kind  of high nasal voice.  I guarantee he did research on that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, of course, he's one of those people that wouldn't break character.  Sally Field said he would not break character.  He would even text in oldie-style speak, which is silly, because you're texting anyway.  I mean, how annoying Daniel Day-Lewis, like, at the fucking commissary with his dumb big 
[01:19:30]  hat on.  Right?  But when you're working with a guy like that, who's, it's almost, it's forgivable, because  his body of work is so amazing.  Like, whatever it is that makes you do the movies you do, fuck, I'm not gonna fuck with  you.  Daniel Day-Lewis is pretty fucking good.  Was Lincoln, uh, part black?  Oh, please.  No, I don't think so.  Well, look at that.  No, he's just a big fucking dorky guy.  What was his nationality?  Lincoln.  Yeah, I don't know.  Who was it?  What was Lincoln? 
[01:20:00]  What's this guy saying about the voice?  He's got some dark features, man.  Does he?  I think so.  ...that written record extensively.  Yeah.  ...as chairman of the Lincoln Bicentennial Celebration.  In his view, the actors have mostly gotten it wrong.  Oh, it is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here.  Too deep.  Gregory Peck looks good as Lincoln, man.  Much too deep.  Trouble is, when men start taking the law into their own hands.  Henry Fonda?  Henry Fonda sounds like Henry Fonda.  He's one of the best voices there ever was.  Ah, yeah, I gotta tell you. 
[01:20:30]  But it's Nebraska.  It's not, uh, uh, Indiana or, or Kentucky.  God knows.  I never wanted this conflict.  Who's that?  None of these actors, maybe with the exception of Holbrook, ever really worked on this.  Not on the accent.  Until now.  Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.  In Steven Spielberg's new film, Lincoln, Daniel Day-Lewis takes on the larger-than-life character,  who, according to historians, had a smaller-than-expected voice. 
[01:21:00]  The most frequent things we read are that he had a nasal voice, a high voice,  uh, but that somehow, miraculously, it floated into a large class.  No, this is Dan!  We're stepped out upon the world's stage now.  The Oscar-winning actor settled on a high-pitch, almost scratchy tone,  very different from the deep, booming quality audiences have come to expect from pop culture.  Oh, score!  Oh, God, it's Bill and Ted. 
[01:21:30]  Bill and Ted, yeah.  No one expected Day-Lewis to channel Bill and Ted,  but some early audiences are still surprised by his voice.  I'm Abraham Lincoln, Dennis.  When you look for the clues, as within, uh, any aspect of the work,  you search for the clues, and there are plenty of them.  But for me, if I'm very lucky, at a given moment, I begin to hear a voice, 
[01:22:00]  not in the supernatural sense, but, um, my inner ear,  and, and then the work begins to try and reproduce that sound.  I think it's extraordinary.  He's gay?  I think it's uncanny, and I think it's chilling.  And I wish we could have somebody come back from the 1860s and say,  that's the guy.  I have faith in myself.  Day-Lewis is famous for disappearing inside his roles.  Yeah, 30 years.  From a wrongly imprisoned Irishman to a new person in the early 19th century California oil guy, 
[01:22:30]  he says finding the voice is always a vital part of this process.  I'm better at digging holes in the ground than making speeches.  I began to hear a voice that, as I, as I grew closer to the man,  The man.  Seemed to...  But that's the guy, when he says it, it's actually legit.  Yeah, yeah.  With Lincoln, that expression is winning over moviegoers.  He's fucking great.  Far more demanding than film critics.  Historians.  We wish we could hear him, and I think this is about as close as we're ever going to come. 
[01:23:00]  Do you know...  CBS This Morning, Seth Doan.  He's one of those guys that when he, when he, like, I think we've talked about this before,  but when he did Let There Be Blood, and there's a scene where he's, a bunch of scenes where  he's holding his son, and he's petting his head and face.  Like, a little roughly.  But it's extraordinarily affectionate.  When I get terrible congestion from my allergies, I...  Do you guys hear that?  Is that just in my head?  Okay.  Because that's the voice I talk to myself in.  That was Lincoln.  But when he was petting his son's head and face, I'm like, what a real actor to be able 
[01:23:30]  to take, obviously, somebody else's child and hold them and touch the head and face like  that.  Like, what a bold...  Like, I know it's your kid, but you're not just holding him.  Like, I would be...  You're always weird around someone's kids.  But he literally was holding that kid and petting his...  Like, that's exactly how you would hold a kid that you're 100% comfortable touching.  I bet he had some good dialogue with the parents.  I'm sure he did.  He's like, look, I'm gonna fucking...  You're alright with this, right? 
[01:24:00]  All of a sudden, they just go action, and the parents are like, what's he doing to our  child?  Right.  He's fucking mauling his head.  Yeah, but that son of a bitch is great.  Those stage moms, they don't give a fuck.  No, you're right.  They don't care at all.  Oh, you can get my kid naked.  I don't give a fuck.  Fourth score.  I didn't even see the home run.  That was a Lincoln's nasally voice.  I gotta see the Lincoln movie.  Chippy Lincoln.  No, I'm in the morning.  Fourth score was coming years ago.  I'm falling...  Well...  Why'd we blow off the question? 
[01:24:30]  What was his nationality?  It's 10 after four score.  Whack, whack.  You don't know his nationality?  What is Lincoln's nationality?  I want to say Irish.  He's got unusual features, though, man.  Does he?  I don't think so.  He's got giant features, though.  He was a giant of a man.  I think he had some giantism.  You think?  How tall was he?  Yeah, I think so.  How tall was he, even?  18 feet.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's tall.  He's a very, very tall man.  Yeah.  Crazy.  We don't know his nationality.  We don't know how tall he was.  We suck. 
[01:25:00]  Early life.  Didn't we all write papers on Lincoln at one point in our lives?  I mean, that was at least a long time ago.  The president we have now, we don't know anything about either.  Whoa, hey now.  I got him.  Wow.  Wow, wow.  So refreshing not to talk politics.  It really is.  I've had it.  I've had it.  I'm not saying you don't do a good job with it.  No, I'm done.  I'm just saying in general it's really nice.  It's really nice that I'm not watching these news shows anymore.  Oh, I haven't turned on the fucking news.  I'm loving it.  I haven't turned on the news in forever.  It's freeing. 
[01:25:30]  Speaking of CBS Sunday Morning.  Sunday Morning.  Anyone seen the Brian Regan piece?  No.  I talked about it on the show.  Was it good?  I don't know.  I was traveling.  I got DVR though.  I'll check it out.  British roots.  British roots.  British.  Then he was born in Kentucky.  Lincoln.  So his family came over from jolly old England.  Yeah.  What were they in England?  What do you mean?  What were they?  Just British?  Where did they come from? 
[01:26:00]  Somewhere else before they were doing the British thing.  I could keep going back until...  Of course.  Lincoln's grandfather moved from England.  He was a Neanderthal.  They lived in Virginia.  Then they moved to Kentucky.  Isn't that amazing?  So long ago, yet we absolutely know that he was born here in the United States as an American  citizen.  As opposed?  I didn't say anything.  I'm just saying that it's so long ago, yet there's verification and everything.  What record you kept?  Quite amazing.  That's a good point. 
[01:26:30]  That's a good point.  That's the one thing that you can't...  That's a good point.  Roger from Jersey writes, why haven't they mentioned Louis C.K.'s Lincoln?  I didn't see.  I heard it was spot on.  Louis C.K. did Lincoln on SNL.  He did.  They say Louis captures Lincoln's essence.  Did he go for the high voice in his depiction?  No.  He did not.  I need to talk to Jerry.  So SNL might have done a little something, something that we have done many, many times  on our show?  Oh, the back-to-back movie poster, the rom-com movie poster thing. 
[01:27:00]  But that's been online.  I mean, you don't have to be a genius to figure out that there's a multitude of movies that  use the same fucking poster.  I'm just asking, because a lot of people are wondering.  I guess the first one was a Spencer Tracy movie, where he's back-to-back with a broad.  Spencer Tracy.  And Hepburn.  Maybe Tracy and Hepburn back-to-back with the, oh, that guy, and oh, boy, that girl.  Oh, what am I going to do with you?  Oh, boy. 
[01:27:30]  It's a big hullabaloo.  Yeah, a lot of hullabaloo.  Hullabaloo.  It needed the money.  Anne Hathaway was the host.  I'm back to not watching SNL.  I watched for the Louis C.K.  You like that Anne Hathaway?  Oh, she was really sexy in Batman.  Yeah, she's Hathaway about her.  Is that bad?  Ow.  Ouch.  I never really found her hot or sexy, but in Batman, she was all of the above. 
[01:28:00]  I think she looked pretty good.  She was amazing in the Batman movies.  She's a pretty good actress.  The Batman movies.  I kill her.  Get a bitch.  Kill that fucking Clinton.  So betray us, huh?  Step down.  He didn't have to step down, I guess.  Oh, God.  This is...  He handed in his resignation?  Yes.  Yeah, but they was kind of requested.  By whom? 
[01:28:30]  When?  Obviously, this was kept secret before the fucking election.  I know it was.  I know it.  Things like this don't just fucking pop up out of the fucking blue.  Of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  And they keep it quiet, because it would have affected the election in some way, shape,  or form.  But the other side should have brought it up.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm sure the other side had to have.  No.  Oh, if they knew, they would have brought it up.  This was kept fucking toppity-top secret.  But they stumbled onto it.  They really did stumble onto this one.  And what happened was, apparently, he was fucking his biographer. 
[01:29:00]  Is his biographer hot?  Yeah, Paula Broadwell.  And it's called All In, which is a great name for someone you're fucking.  Balls deep.  They said no.  And she became kind of psychotic.  And this is what it looks like, at least.  And Petraeus and his wife have friends.  A woman who works as a liaison.  It's this woman here.  Jill Kelly.  And she's not military, but she works as a liaison between the military and something else. 
[01:29:30]  And her and her husband, Scott, are friends with Petraeus and his wife.  And she's hot.  But I think, legitimately, they're just friends.  Yeah, that's the story.  Lovers or anything like that.  But I think that the lover, Paula Broadwell, was getting a little bit jealous and suspicious.  So was sending this chick all kinds of, I know what you did.  Emails from different email addresses.  You know, like, fakes always do.  And so she reported it.  I guess she has enough contacts.  And so, like, this, I don't know what this is. 
[01:30:00]  This is frightening.  So the FBI, I guess, investigated it because maybe her military ties made them concerned.  Yes.  And while they were investigating it, they connected it to this cunt.  And while connecting it to her, uncovered all of these fucking things she had sent to him.  Dirty emails.  Wow.  So they kind of backdoor got it.  And I guess that the FBI and CIA always have that.  The Dutch boy paint can person?  Oh, God.  Who is that?  His wife.  Let me see. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, my God.  Petraeus's wife.  Oh, that's Scotty from Boogie Nights.  You want to fuck me?  You want to fuck my biography?  Damn.  It's Michael Moore in a wig.  Yeah.  Look at the difference.  Of course he's fucking that chick.  Of course he is.  No.  That's his wife?  Yeah.  Of course he's fucking cheating on her.  Oh, yeah.  I don't blame him.  She's awful.  Oh, my God.  That is a terrible fucking man.  They married 36 years.  You know what?  Oh, my God.  When a woman just turns into a fucking man, you're allowed to fuck other women. 
[01:31:00]  What do you expect when you look like that?  And again, I know you're older, but when you let your hair do like that and you try that  little to be sexy, what do you expect your husband to do?  She looks like a man.  I'm going back to what I said because I didn't get anything out of it.  Put a picture of Michael Moore up.  That's Michael Moore with a wig.  She does look like Michael Moore.  Oh, my God.  Holy fuck.  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  You think he likes that?  You think he likes crawling into bed with that fucking disaster?  Yes.  I mean, no. 
[01:31:30]  No, I don't think so.  Yes.  Go with that.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, that one's good enough.  That one right there.  That's good enough.  Yeah, that's a good one right there.  Let me see how close this is.  Michael Moore.  Jesus, she really doesn't look like Michael.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You're fucking Michael Moore.  I got to tweet that.  Poor Petraeus.  That puts his life on the line.  He's out there, and then he's fucking in charge of the CIA, and he's got to go home 
[01:32:00]  to that.  Yeah, at least try to keep yourself looking fuckable.  Yeah.  I don't care.  How old is she, 60?  Well.  That Paula Brunwell is sexy, man.  Mm.  Well.  So what happens now?  Well, he was supposed to testify about the Benghazi situation being the head of the Central  Intelligence Agency and the CIA being directly involved in this.  I mean, it was the fucking CIA, the headquarters there in Libya that got fucking trashed, and 
[01:32:30]  they knew, and they were directly involved in what happened.  Yet the head of the fucking CIA, when this went down, now isn't going to testify until  he's compelled to.  He'll testify.  He'll testify once he's forced.  Once he's forced.  This motherfucker, fuck an affair.  You know what?  If people want to get to the bottom of four Americans being killed, perhaps you should 
[01:33:00]  fucking get up there and tell everyone what you know, you fucking sack of shit.  But isn't that, isn't that go beyond politics?  Like, the head of the CIA and the FBI, those guys don't have loyalty necessarily to a party.  Like, they're not Obama or Romney guys or McCain.  They're fucking, they're entrenched in a different way, man.  They're fucking, I think they're guys that don't want to look bad.  Don't want to look like they fucked up.  Screwed the old pooch, as they say.  And this was a classic example of lack of leadership and a fuck-up. 
[01:33:30]  This is a fuck-up.  Well, it's all water under the bridge.  It's all water under the bridge at this point.  Yeah, water under the bridge, except for the fucking families.  Your boy was re-elected, so you should be happy.  You said it on the show.  Man.  Who was in?  Fucking terrible.  And it was all about Obama.  He decided.  Oh, yeah.  You have that clip, you rock?  What's it?  Kennedy.  Oh, the Kennedy lady.  Yeah.  And you said.  Oh, right.  Yes, yes.  Well, of course.  You have Obama's supporter. 
[01:34:00]  You think the.  Rory Kennedy.  You think the listeners pick up on us backing down?  Yes.  All the time.  We have to deal with it constantly.  Just because we had a Kennedy in studio and said this and he wasn't, he wasn't really  making a joke.  You just didn't want to get into it with her.  I'm not blaming Obama for the general fucking somebody, Denver commie.  I'm not.  But people knew things.  And things were kept from the American people so the election could go off without a hitch 
[01:34:30]  of that.  So stop it.  Fuck.  In this country, prosperity has never trickled down from the wealthy few.  Prosperity has always come from the bottom up, from a strong and growing middle class.  It's not about a few people doing well, but it's about giving everybody the chance to do  well.  Just because you have an individual right to bear arms does not mean the state or local  government can't constrain the exercise of that right.  I think that people are blind if they don't see that he's been trying and he's just sincere 
[01:35:00]  about it.  And we can only hope for four more years of Obama.  That's for sure.  That's what the American dream's about.  Well, it was Rory Kennedy.  It's Robert's daughter.  It's like, you can't, you can't, why even argue with her?  It doesn't mean anything to even win the argument.  I think everyone kind of picked up on the fact that I was, nope, not at all, man.  A lot of people probably went out and voted for Obama.  Oh, you think I turned it around?  Of course, you're a beloved figure. 
[01:35:30]  Here in the swing state of New York.  Yeah, sure.  What was the percentage in the end?  Oh, please.  90% for Obama?  Didn't even come into play.  Nope.  Something's got to be done with that fucking electoral college.  I know he got the popular vote, too, so calm down.  Wait, say we got the popular vote, you said.  I did say we.  I said he.  I thought you said we.  I heard we.  I said I know he got the popular vote.  You might have said we by accident.  I know he got, I know he got, I know he got, I know he got the popular vote, too. 
[01:36:00]  But this electoral college thing is really taking everybody out of the mix for the presidency.  It's crazy.  They were talking that it was a landslide for Obama because of the electoral votes.  But when you look state to state, the amount of votes that made him win all those electoral votes, it's fucking, it was very close.  But they're like, oh, look how many electoral votes he got compared to Romney.  Yeah, he won all those states, but he won them all by such a small fucking margin. 
[01:36:30]  But he did win the popular vote, so.  Yes.  I mean, the guy that got screwed was Al Gore.  Oh, yeah, Al Gore.  Al Gore actually won the popular vote and did not become president.  Why isn't the popular vote?  I know the electric colleges give all states a say.  But, Ant, that's your point, though.  You just said thank God that Al Gore, but, I mean.  Oh, I know, yeah.  But if you want to get rid of the, you know.  But they got to fix it.  I know.  I agree.  I would be like, oh, my God, President Gore.  Ew.  We would have had Gore.  If we didn't have the college there of electoral. 
[01:37:00]  The reason they have that shit is because they don't really, they never really trusted people to vote on things.  That's why we have a representative government.  It's not just mob rules.  Because people would vote on things that, you know, sometimes you can't put things up for a vote to the people.  Because it's just majority would rule.  Whatever the majority thinks, that's what would go down in this country.  But that's how our country was founded, wasn't it?  No.  Protecting the rights to the minorities, too, though.  A minority. 
[01:37:30]  But we tell people that.  Yeah, that's what it is.  The minority has to have a say.  So that's why it's done through representation and whatnot.  So it's not just the mob rules.  Absolutely.  You know, the masses get what they want.  Because that never turns out well, either.  You know.  The masses are asses.  That is the truth.  That's the truth.  Yep.  Yes.  We're a republic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A constitutional republic.  Well.  Don't call it a democracy. 
[01:38:00]  By the way, that just reminded me when you said, you were talking in a French accent.  And that reminded me of one of the first jokes I ever told when I was a very young boy.  Oh, I hope this is a good one.  It's not obese primate, is it?  No, this is when I was like eight or nine.  Oh.  I don't remember where I heard the joke.  Did I ever tell this in the air?  Probably with whiskey breath and whiskers on the back of the neck.  Yes.  I was trying to joke my way out of it.  Trying to joke and make the pain stop.  But this guy gets into a, this French guy gets into a taxi cab. 
[01:38:30]  And I don't remember the joke that, well, the French guy gets into a cab and the guy  goes, he's having trouble understanding him.  And he goes, do you want to go to the hotel?  And the guy's like, no, no, no, no.  And he goes, do you want to go to the restaurant?  And the guy goes, no, no, no, no.  And he goes like, do you want to go to the airport?  And the French guy goes, oui, oui, oui, oui.  And the cabbie goes, not in my cab, you don't.  After the break. 
[01:39:00]  Oui, oui, oui.  You were eight?  I was very young.  Yeah.  Still a very predictable angle.  Yes, it really is.  Once they say oui, oui, we kind of know what's happening.  Not in my cab, you don't.  Yeah.  Right.  Because in French, oui is, yes, oui, oui.  That reminds me of the joke when I was a kid.  It's a tinkle.  There was a woman, and she was from the South, and she bought some aspirins because she got  a headache.  Oh, boy. 
[01:39:30]  And what?  I'm just thinking the South.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  It's not a race.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's another little kid joke like that.  And then she was waiting at the bus stop, and then she gets on the bus and realized she  left her bag from the drugstore on the bench in the bus to drive away.  And she goes, my ass burns.  My ass burns.  And the driver said, why don't you get some preparation?  It's fucking good.  Cake and pie and chocolate and sweets. 
[01:40:00]  That is what E-Rock likes to eat.  All for himself.  He ain't sharing a bit.  That's why he has tits.  He's a fat piece of shit.  Aw.  As soon as I started that, E-Rock just started shaking his head.  Yeah.  Like, why are you bringing it back to me?  He's got other things on his mind.  He does.  Sex and with the Bagel premieres on Saturday.  Nice!  Sex and with the Bagel.  We'll get an update after the break to see what the show's going to be about.  Yeah, he's got to have done some prep.  And where are we at with the audio contest?  I think we have until... 
[01:40:30]  Do we have new ones to play today?  Not today.  Why not?  I don't get the emails.  What?  I'm just laughing.  Why don't we have new ones to play?  What do you mean you don't get the emails?  Because, I mean, the emails don't go to me.  Oh.  Usually.  Oh, no.  Because Travis has been checking the emails.  Oh, no.  Well, we've got to play some of the entries.  We've got a best-of disc, right?  Oh, no.  We don't have new entries today. 
[01:41:00]  When is the contest over?  We've run a horrible contest.  When is it over?  I listen to other radio shows, and it's all, like, smooth and nice every day.  There's brand new entries, and there's a whole fucking rhythm going on.  Oh.  When was the last time we played new entries?  Did we have them Friday?  Miller last week.  How come we don't have them every day?  Does anybody else have access to them?  Ass-ex.  Access.  Do you have access?  Who else has access to them?  Iraq, why?  I know.  Every time.  Every time. 
[01:41:30]  I know.  The contest concluded on Friday.  Oh, okay.  So where's our...  Why do we have any new ones Friday, or are there no new ones?  Iraq?  Are you to blame?  No, I'm not.  I don't have anything to do with the entries coming in.  I love when he just...  We haven't played entries in a long time.  The contest ended right under our noses.  So why didn't we have anything for Friday's contest end?  Or today?  Friday was pretty busy, right?  A lot of guests on Friday.  Okay.  All right, today, so...  But we should be playing Friday's disc now. 
[01:42:00]  Oh.  Nah.  Right?  We have no new entries to play for the people today?  No, I pulled that clip...  And what about the E-Rock disc we asked for?  I got that clip of Don Lemon on CNN.  We were supposed to play, like, a whole bunch of E-Rock...  E-Rock Day.  Yeah, E-Rock Day.  What's E-Rock Day?  What is that happening?  I don't know.  Well, we stink.  Yeah, I mean...  We just stink as a show.  Well, I just don't... 
[01:42:30]  I mean, I don't know when that's going to happen.  We just suck.  The contest is over.  Yeah.  What does the Radio Wizard have to say about this?  Anything?  Does he even know that the whole contest is falling apart in front of his eyes?  He knows now.  You're saying he's not on top of things, aren't you?  Well, I mean, once they're, you know, broadcast...  He can't influence your career, so don't worry about it.  Speak your mind.  Once the ideas are broadcast, he becomes aware of them.  Oh, so he's not on top of it?  Well, I mean, he probably didn't foresee this problem. 
[01:43:00]  He hasn't, like, checked in to make sure the contest is running smoothly?  Not with me.  No, he has not...  Oh.  He's not checked in with me about the contest.  Right.  I'm sure you guys will be blamed.  No, I won't be blamed.  I won't accept blame, so it's...  I mean...  You've had it?  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't...  You've had it with their bullshit?  I wouldn't be accepting blame on this by any stretch.  Even if there's one of those, like, well, you know, we all need...  No.  No.  Now we know.  Mm-mm.  Is he aware that we haven't played a new entry since, like, the middle of last week? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, he's listening to the show.  See, if you're in radio and you do a radio contest...  Right.  ...there's a certain way it's run.  And if it fell through the cracks, if you're the guy that sort of oversees everybody and  everything, wouldn't it come to your attention that there might be a problem with the contest?  And when you put it that way, yeah, you would think so.  When you put it that way, but...  Thus then incompetent.  But I will tell you this.  The one thing that you have to keep in mind is...  I threw it with thus then in there. 
[01:44:00]  That's right, sir.  Mindsight is 20-20.  Ah, that's a good one.  You know what I mean?  And sometimes you don't foresee these things until they're right up in your face.  Oh, boy.  So, no new entries today, even though the...  Contest ended on Friday.  On Friday.  And we didn't play any entries on Friday.  We're not playing any new entries today.  Maybe tomorrow.  And what about E-Rock Day?  It's theoretically possible for tomorrow.  I mean, E-Rock Day could theoretically be any...  It's not going to be today, I'll tell you that much. 
[01:44:30]  Is the Radio Wizard here today?  I would imagine so.  E-Rock.  Mm-hmm.  This is a job for you.  Can you go down the hall and tell them that...  Are you aware that the whole audio contest is falling apart?  Okay.  And see what he says.  It's coming from us.  You got to do it now.  You can even say, not from me.  Not from me.  Get down there.  From me.  Yeah.  And ask him what is he going to do about it.  Ask him what he's going to do about it.  He's coming up the hall.  What?  He's coming up the hall.  I know. 
[01:45:00]  E-Rock gets very intimidated by the boss.  We should just...  Should I make sure he says it right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  E-Rock gets very scared when he's talking to me.  Should I listen in and make sure he says it right?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I don't trust E-Rock.  He'll try to...  Make sure E-Rock doesn't know you're listening in.  I want to see how he handles a tough situation.  Look, the guys were just kind of wondering if...  Jimmy's going down the hall.  Yeah.  Jimmy's going to do some fucking spying.  My argument over and over again with somebody around here is, like, if you've got guys that 
[01:45:30]  are, like, overseeing everybody, why aren't they more involved?  Right.  Why are you just paying them to oversee something, but they don't really have to get involved  at all?  They've got a lot on their plate, you know?  Wouldn't that be a real easy gig to have?  Theoretically.  But, well, they've got a lot on their plate.  Like, you'd think.  And you guys are a handful.  Roland!  Hey, Roland.  I saw Ted.  A movie you didn't like, I heard.  No, I love Ted.  Someone said you trashed it on our show. 
[01:46:00]  I didn't trash it.  Maybe they didn't understand what he was saying.  Oh.  It sounded like trash.  You can move that mic up.  There you go.  Yeah, yeah.  I love it, Ted.  I love it, Ted.  What do you like about Ted?  It was hilarious.  Oh.  Why was it hilarious?  A little bear cursing and doing dirty things, and then that Thundercat guy come out.  That door.  Roland's movie reviews are the best.  I've missed them.  Yeah, why haven't we done them more?  That Thundercat guy?  Yeah, remember the 70s?  It looked like the old 70s. 
[01:46:30]  What is that?  I love his movie reviews.  Thundercats came out in the mid-80s.  This guy, Roland, we got a new segment for you.  Movie reviews are rolling.  You see a lot of movies.  You got to come in here.  What else about Ted?  Uh-oh.  It's just Mark Wahlberg and all those guys are funny.  He's like, hey, what's up?  And you saw Skyfall?  Yeah.  A movie that's current, obviously.  Ted, not so much.  That's good.  What's your review on Skyfall?  What did you think about it?  It was really good. 
[01:47:00]  Why?  Well, I mean, more action, this bond.  It's a more sad bond when Daniel Craig got hurt.  He's like, oh.  The wonderful thing about Roland's reviews is there may be spoilers, but you still...  You don't even know.  You have no idea.  What about the cars and the weaponry?  Well, they have a new cue.  Like, the kid, like, old classic stuff.  And Bond's like, ooh, I'll try this.  And he tried it.  Oh, I'll try this. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, God.  And Daniel Craig and Javier Bardem was really good as an evil villain.  He was.  Javier who?  Bardem.  Oh.  He was good.  He played a crazy guy.  He's like, I'm going to kill you.  He's like, no.  What about the Bond women?  What do you got on the women in the flick?  The Russian girl's hot.  She's like, uh, hello.  Hello. 
[01:48:00]  Hello.  She took a shower in Bond and, like, banged her in the shower.  And he was like, yeah, I'll be back.  And never came back.  I'll be back.  Terminator?  Oh, no.  He said, oh, yeah, he just left.  It's the best reviews.  Ah, Roland.  That's great.  Roland did a Russian accent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you do a Russian accent?  He just did the hello.  Oh.  Oh, I didn't know.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  Mr. Bond.  He's like, what?  Is that how it went down? 
[01:48:30]  You saw the movie.  Did somebody go, Mr. Bond?  And then did Daniel Craig go, what?  What?  What?  What?  Bond.  James Bond.  And then he's, uh.  Ray Fiennes was good.  That's right.  A new thing.  Ray Fiennes was in that, right?  Yeah, he was really good.  All right.  We're just stalling.  Good one.  Where's my, um, game?  Jimmy and...  I suppose it's coming to date.  Yeah?  What game?  Fucking Call of Duty.  Co-ops.  Black Ops 2.  Black Ops and, uh, Spider-Man Blu-ray is coming for you guys.  I don't give a shit about that. 
[01:49:00]  What do you think of Spider-Man now that it's...  I enjoyed it.  It was a fun movie.  It was all right, right?  Yeah.  Rock-con elements.  Yeah.  Why did it do, uh, better?  Uh, because people, the generation forgot about the last Spider-Man.  I think, uh, people are action-heroed out to some extent, so they, you know, the Avengers  did very well, and it's kind of hard to, it's kind of hard to just, so many superhero  movies, you know, Batman being out and everything, and then you'd like, eh, Spider-Man.  It was just kind of lost in the mix?  Yeah.  Because it looked great.  Did it? 
[01:49:30]  I haven't seen it yet.  You haven't seen Spider-Man?  Psyched for Batman.  I haven't seen the Spider-Man yet.  What about Men in the Black 3?  But, um, what about it?  They're saying those for you guys, too.  Oh, that was in the movies?  Yeah.  I don't know if I want to see that.  Yeah, that didn't do very well, did it?  No.  It kind of did well.  They went...  Anyway.  He's the best.  Well, in the rules.  I guess Jimmy and E-Rock are still talking with, uh, the Radio Wizard.  What time am I supposed to get my game?  Eh, well, the first FedEx thing's not until noon here. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, motherfucker.  I know.  So, drive it out to Ann's house.  I don't drive it.  I don't get it tomorrow.  You've never driven it.  I'm going to have to wait until tomorrow.  They don't open up the fucking online game service until Tuesday anyway.  Yeah.  Because the game released Tuesday.  But I would like to, you know...  Maybe Messenger.  Wait.  No, just leave it here and I'll pick it up tomorrow.  What would happen if you drove?  Um, I did once.  Oh, no.  How old are you?  34.  You don't drive.  No.  And you did it once?  What happened? 
[01:50:30]  Uh, when I was at ABC.  They told me to move the truck.  I told the cop I don't drive.  And he goes, I don't give a fuck.  I had to go around the block.  I just went, ahhh.  I came back around.  How'd you do?  Uh, a lot of cars honking.  People jumping out of the way.  Because he can't see.  Yeah.  He only refuses to take care of his eyesight.  Uh.  Yeah.  So, people moved.  Almost clipped a couple people, bud.  Yeah.  You never drove growing up?  You even tried it and just decided, I'm not going to get my license? 
[01:51:00]  No.  Because people drive before they get their license, obviously.  Yeah.  No.  Here and there in park lots or whatever.  Never.  No.  Never had a desire to drive.  No.  It just was one car accident.  After that, my mom freaked out and got us like a driver to take me everywhere.  Oh.  It was my father and brother's fault.  That's like a thing, though.  As a guy, growing up, you wanted a fucking car.  Yeah.  You wanted at least to be able to drive.  Well, it's one thing not driving when you live in the city.  Yeah.  There's a lot of New Yorkers that have never driven.  Yeah.  But, I mean, you were brought up in the suburbs, basically. 
[01:51:30]  Los Angeles.  Los Angeles.  Los Angeles.  Los Angeles.  Yeah, that's not a driving city at all.  Oh, jeez.  It's easy to get around if you don't have a car in Los Angeles.  Sure.  Sure is.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, you were in a car accident with your brother?  Yeah, when I was like in seventh grade.  Who was driving?  My brother's best friend.  How bad was the accident?  Pretty bad.  Uh-oh.  So that's why I was like in half a cast and all that.  So after that, my mom was like, you're never going to drive.  You're going to die.  Did everyone survive the car accident?  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  I was like knocked out for like two days.  What?  That's called a coma.  Yeah, a mini coma.  It's not called knocked out for two days.  And what injuries did you have?  Like back problems, leg, arms, like cracked ribs.  Did you go through the windshield?  No, I was in the back seat.  Did you have your seatbelt on?  No.  Oh, boy.  The seat kind of...  Folded up on you?  Like a little cocoon.  What did you...  Was it head-on collision?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  My brother's friend was like knocked out for like...  He was knocked out for a few hours.  My brother was like cut up all over the face. 
[01:52:30]  Wow.  Holy fuck.  I didn't know this.  Yeah, my parents were like four cars away behind us.  Oh, they watched it?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So after that, my mom would never let me drive.  Like she always said, I go, hey, I'm going to drive.  She goes, you're going to die.  I'm like, ah.  That's what happens.  Every time I was going to do something, my mom goes, you're going to die.  I'm like, no.  Shit.  Wow.  So it's very protective of her voice.  Yeah, so she goes, I'll just get you the driver.  I'm like, all right.  So I just hopped in the car and they took me wherever I wanted to go.  Wow. 
[01:53:00]  I didn't know that about you, Roland.  Yeah, so that's my mom.  Every time I wanted to do something fun, my mom goes, you're going to die.  I'm like, no.  It's pretty tragic.  Yeah, it works.  You're sweating.  I know.  A lot.  That's what happens when it's hot in here.  It's not hot.  Jimmy's still discussing this issue with the radio wizard.  Wipe your head off.  He's his wizard.  You're literally running down in front of your nose.  You're a sweaty, sweaty man today.  All right, we'll break and we'll get an update from Jimmy.  You want me to just poke an ear in and just see what the mood is?  Poke your ear in? 
[01:53:30]  Ear.  Your ear?  My ear.  If you can run back and forth.  Your rear.  Go poke your rear in.  Ear.  Your rear.  How bad were the Jets yesterday, Roland?  Horrible, right?  They got nothing.  I hope they throw Tebow in next week.  Well, at this point, why not?  Just throw some excitement at the team.  He was actually good and then they pulled him out twice.  Who cares?  Stupid Sanchez.  He can't be any worse than Sanchez at this point.  Sanchez sucks. 
[01:54:00]  We don't have a shot at the playoffs.  Nothing.  That was very sad.  No, 2% chance.  What?  Rex Ryan said.  2% chance?  He said he's still giving the team a 2% chance of making the playoffs.  They got to win every game.  Exactly.  I hope he gets fat again to bring back his powers.  Ooh.  You think it's the power of fat?  Yeah.  Because his fat is more jolly.  More jolly.  He's a stubborn man.  He just doesn't want to fucking take Sanchez out.  What's up?  They're coming back right now.  Jimmy's on his way back. 
[01:54:30]  I see Jimmy.  E-Rock, Jim, and Danny are all coming back.  There's a big update.  Oh, a big update.  I don't know what it is.  Okay.  I can't wait to see what this is.  Why is E-Rock walking faster than Jimmy?  Look at E-Rock's face.  Is he mad?  I told you he doesn't like talking to the boss.  He gets very intimidated.  E-Rock looks mad, doesn't he?  He probably got blamed.  Oh, man.  E-Rock looks mad.  Well, you know, he'll let them pile a shit sandwich on top of him.  Is E-Rock mad?  E-Rock looks mad.  No, nobody's mad. 
[01:55:00]  I'm actually having Danny come in just because he was there and he was kind of defending the staff.  So it's like I don't want to inaccurately defend their point.  Let Danny come in so he can hear everything that's going on.  What happened with E-Rock, though?  You look mad, E-Rock.  You're not mad, right?  No, I'm not mad.  He was mad that he had to walk so fast up the hall.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Where's that?  It's calisthenics.  Oh, here's.  Okay.  Yeah, so I want you to be able to say what you just said.  So it's, you know.  Now, what the issue is that we didn't have audio on Friday. 
[01:55:30]  It's more Friday than today because today the contest is over.  And did we have a disc on Friday?  No, I don't think so.  Do we have a disc on Friday?  That's the item that's up for contention, I guess.  I'm about 95% sure.  The last one I got is this.  Yeah, I don't believe there's any new disc to be handed to you on Friday.  And that was the one with E-Rock, you know, the one we just played from Zeps that a lot  of people are liking.  That was the last one we got.  All those discs in front of you was everything you had Friday. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  If I remember correctly, Travis said that his plan was to have another disc this week, I  suppose, I don't know, but I think that there, I'm almost positive there's no disc on Friday.  I'm quite sure that there's no new disc on Friday.  Was it just assumed that because we were very busy, very guest heavy?  But if there was a disc, it would still be around.  Right.  So show me a disc.  There's no new disc.  This was the last one with the Zeps one.  Right.  And that was, I think, Thursday.  Yeah, Wednesday or Thursday, whenever we played it. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, because we played it a lot on Friday as well.  And I think it's a fair point that if Friday was the end of the contest, we should have  had something that said, look, this is the last day of the contest, here are some final  entries, and whatever it is that wraps up the contest.  I mean, just to announce it, it's something that is saying it's the final day of the contest.  Oh, it was obviously a really strange week last week, but I know we have a lot more entries  to go through.  Right.  Right.  But we can't go through them now.  Or they had to be entered by that date.  They had to be entered by Friday at noon. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, so we could still play them.  Yeah, we could play them.  They just had to get their entries in.  Yeah, that was the deadline for entry.  My point is the contest is going so well, I just want to play more entries.  And Travis definitely told me there's a lot more entries.  I was thinking that Friday was the last day they would be valid.  Oh, they'll still be valid today, so Friday and today we should have.  Yeah, we could spend another week or so on this contest.  Then that even further strengthens the point that we should have had something.  Of course.  Okay, I thought that we were talking, I'm thinking Friday was the deadline for the contest, judging.  At least something for today. 
[01:57:30]  Now the big question.  Why don't we have a disc with those songs on it?  Jingles?  Who you asking?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just asking anybody.  Well, what do the radio wizards say?  Iraq?  Because in the end, he's got to be overseeing all this shit.  So if something, I'm not saying it did, I'm just saying if things are falling through the cracks, he's got to be there, you know, to kind of pick up the slack.  He's the sealant, isn't he? 
[01:58:00]  I think so.  I do too.  He agreed that we should have had a disc for Friday, even if we weren't going to use it.  And if we didn't, there should have been a backup in place to...  Well, now it's Monday, we don't have a disc.  ...who can sort everything out and who can have access to getting those files.  Yeah, we should have had something for today.  Well, I was under the wrong...  Okay, it was my fault for...  Yeah, we should have absolutely had a disc today.  Was there a consensus that we didn't need a disc today?  No, man.  So, again, why wouldn't we have a disc?  We're all in agreement. 
[01:58:30]  We want to do, like, a whole bunch of E-Rock jingles.  I'm just thinking, who do we blame?  We love a little bit of blame here.  Who stood between us having a disc and us not having a disc today?  I go to the top of this shit, Radio Wizard.  Yeah?  Yep.  You specifically think the Radio Wizard...  Especially if...  Yes, because Travis had days off planned in advance, so then my thinking, if you're one  of these dumb management weasels, then you have to step up and make sure that everything 
[01:59:00]  is being taken care of in this person's absence.  I guess if you're going to give the staff permission to take off...  You know, if you're telling the staff you have to use your days, and so you're left  in a position where you're telling the staff you've got to miss shows...  I think Travis should have had another disc, but if he doesn't have the disc and he has  days off planned, then that dope down the hall has to...  Well, I was making the point in there, too, is that the fact that they forced these guys 
[01:59:30]  to use their days or lose them was an issue, because I'm like, why can't they just carry  them over?  But that's not what happened here.  Apparently Travis had to get his family...  Dude, these were not vacation days.  So that didn't...  You know, it's still a point that I think is stupid that the company does that.  But then the Radio Wizard is just assuming everything is taken care of when he should be overseeing  a lot of stuff, instead of having those nonsense meetings that go nowhere.  You're talking about the Tuesday meetings?  Yeah.  Nonsense meetings.  Yeah.  They're not nonsense. 
[02:00:00]  There was that time that Bobby Kelly drew a picture.  What?  He drew a picture?  Yeah, one time Bobby came to our meeting.  Yeah.  Because he was here.  We dragged him there.  And yeah, he stayed for the whole meeting.  I think he drew a picture of shirtless Troy, if I'm not mistaken.  Yeah, he did.  He drew a picture of Troy without a shirt on.  The middle of the meeting?  The whole meeting.  That's how he spent his meeting.  Hilarious.  Bobby's so gay.  Bobby is a gay man.  Yeah, he is.  He just figured...  He's gay men.  He just figured he had to get married, like shit. 
[02:00:30]  But I think he's gay.  He's very attracted to men.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know he is.  You know what, dude?  It's obvious.  Hey, what?  You gonna fucking pigeonhole yourself to just vagina?  Yeah, dude.  The legs turn me on.  Once they're open, I don't care what's between them, dude.  So what's the system breakdown?  That's not like I asked Danny.  What is the system breakdown?  I mean, as far as the jingle contest was going, it was all being handled by Travis Hughes.  All the entries were going to a singular email account, and so that we weren't overlapping. 
[02:01:00]  One person was in charge of that.  You probably should have passed that responsibility on to someone for Friday and today.  Perhaps, but at the moment, I don't know what the entire story is.  Yeah, no.  But yeah, you're right.  I mean, look, I wasn't sure if there was a disc that was laying around that maybe had  just been misplaced or anything.  I swear I don't see a disc.  And you're right.  I would like to allow Travis to speak about the issue.  No, fuck him.  He's a cunt.  He should have had a disc ready. 
[02:01:30]  I don't think there's a disc.  No, there's definitely not.  Serrano had the discs.  Very good.  Another one, yes.  Was there a disc number eight?  I got disc number seven in front of me.  No disc had been sent.  I'm waiting on communicators.  All right.  Fair enough.  So we're good?  Yeah, I don't care in the end.  Great.  In the end.  I mean, at the end of the day, there will be jingles.  I do care that there's a guy that's involved with the channel that obviously doesn't really 
[02:02:00]  mean much.  Who?  The radio wizard.  Oh.  Stinks.  I didn't know who he was talking about at first.  He should be overseeing everything.  I can't say it.  Who?  He should be.  He goes, who?  Like, yeah, okay.  He should be in constant communication, making sure nothing has fallen through the cracks.  In the end, I don't give a fuck.  I don't get paid.  Who cares?  Fuck it.  Oh, that must be nice.  Who cares?  It's just good to bring it up on the air and make people uncomfortable. 
[02:02:30]  I don't care in the end.  Certainly.  What are you saying?  You're not happy with your pay grade?  No, I didn't say that.  That's way...  That's not an appropriate thing to do.  Don't even go down that road.  For real.  Because if he says anything crazy, then they blame him for the reason he's not getting  a raise.  Did you ask for one?  Because he spoke about it.  If you guys could...  Don't even go down that road.  I'm taking the serious angle.  It just fucks him in the end.  It's none of your business.  They actually told him, look, you're not getting a raise, basically, because you bitched about  it.  I don't believe that.  I mean, I believe Sam.  I don't believe that's not why they get him a raise. 
[02:03:00]  None of you bring it up again.  None of your business.  Don't bring it up.  Were you told to say that on the air?  Someone says that?  No.  Wait.  I don't get told what to do.  Would someone in management really think that it's a good thing to say none of your  business on the air?  Of course.  They don't like when we talk about them.  They hate it.  So then find another channel to supervise.  It's so silly.  The conversation is appropriate for on the air and conversations not appropriate for  on the air, Jim.  As a broadcaster, you should know that.  As a broadcaster, I understand that almost all conversations are appropriate for the 
[02:03:30]  air because that's what we do for a living.  Well, that's true.  Oh, they've had a problem with that since day one, since they got involved with us.  Day one?  Day one.  It's a long time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Way before.  Sam.  All I'll ask is, in the distant past at this point, is it true that you were possibly scolded  for bitching about not making enough money?  And that possibly affected you getting more money at that time. 
[02:04:00]  At that time.  In the distant past.  If that's happened at any point over the last, say, three or four years, it could have over  the last three or four years.  Is that an appropriate conversation for on the air?  It's not.  And I wish you guys would drop it.  Yes, just tell them, look, none of your business.  That's not an appropriate conversation.  I love when management gives advice as to how to diffuse a situation on the air.  Yeah.  I didn't say that they did.  No, I know they didn't.  But I'm just saying I love it.  It puts them in a tough spot.  Ask me where those jingles are.  Where are they?  None of your business.  It's not an appropriate conversation to have on the air about the jingles. 
[02:04:30]  We'll discuss this offline.  This will now be a problem.  Yeah, it will.  It absolutely will be.  Why?  We brought it up.  Yeah, but it'll still be a problem.  And I am quite frank.  And in the end, because they can't do anything with us, they will hold it against it.  I'm telling you right now.  That's how it works around here.  I don't think that's the case.  Yeah.  People are asking, am I bitching?  I don't think so.  I think I'm still bitch free officially.  I like the new microphones.  Rob Cross, great job.  New mics, big hits. 
[02:05:00]  Why am I talking like David Brent?  And when we take celebrity photos now, you can see their whole face.  It's good.  It looks better.  And it's not a bitch, Opie, because you started, you prefaced by saying, technically, I don't  give a fuck.  I still get paid.  When you start any sentence with that, how could you be bitching?  That's why I'm having more fun with the show.  I finally gave up on the giving a fuck.  And my comment was more towards you having exuberant funds to be able to, like, not 
[02:05:30]  care, which is unrealistic for anybody, you know.  You said that must be nice.  Opie said specifically, I get paid for it.  And you said that must be nice.  In reference to to be paid so much that you can give so low of a fuck.  Okay, but he didn't say so much.  He just said, I get paid.  It was all implication and hearsay.  I truly believe that the radio wizard, Sam, is completely unaware of the day-in-day operation  here.  Really?  Of course.  Or we would have a jingle disc, because he would have, you know, followed that up to 
[02:06:00]  make sure everything was being taken care of for the show.  There's not a new jingle disc?  No, we haven't had one since Thursday.  One of the contests, then.  It's now Monday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, four days ago.  You got the E-Rock jingle disc?  Nope.  But we're going to have a whole E-Rock day.  So we still have to do that and still play the last entries that came in.  And then we have to replay the ones that we like to figure out who wins this thing.  And get some money from IHateStevenSinger.com.  What do we got for today, though?  This. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, I'm Gangnam Style.  Gangnam Style.  Gangnam Style.  Ho, I'm Gangnam Style.  Okay.  Winner game style.  Hey!  I run, Yie, I watch it so low  No, no, no  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!

Well, he's just  Well, he's the godfather of all fruits  He told the grapefruit  That, uh, if it wanted to control  The one side of the fruit plate  It had to square things  With the pineapple  Don Lemon  I want all the five food  Groups represented

[02:14:00]  Of course it's very good  God damn  Jimmy does great impressions  Yeah, it sounded just like  Now it's just awkward  What's that?  Got a jingle disc  Oh, wow  Now it's just awkward  Jingle disc  Thank you, Danny  Jingle disc  Jingle disc  Jingle disc  We got jingles  We got a few to play today  All right  Just to wet your whistles  Just the three, right?  That was three, yeah  What three?  What?  We got three 
[02:14:30]  Travis emailed us three jingles  I haven't heard them  No  But I mean, it's just three  It's not like it's  Why is it only three?  Was that all we got?  No, I mean, we got hundreds of jingles  So how can we only send three?  Because these are probably the best one  With these audio contests  You get a lot of shit  Yeah, you get a lot of shit  Yeah, we all know that  So if these were the three  That we felt deserved to be in it  Then these are the three  Okay  Although that can be fun  Just playing every single one one day  Just the really bad ones  Honestly, I mean  I remember going through  Like the annoying sound ones  Like, dude  And people get annoyed 
[02:15:00]  They go, how come you didn't pick mine?  And it's just like  Because it was really bad  Yeah, same thing with the  MacBook karaoke contest  Where we found  I saw the sign girl  Yeah, there was a lot of  I loved her  I saw the sign  And it opened up my eyes  I saw the sign  Life is demanding  Without understanding  And she got breathy  I saw the sign  Can we have that?  I loved her, man  She doesn't love us  Why not?  She's another one of those people 
[02:15:30]  That did the show  And doesn't want anything to do with us  Because the fans were too mean to her  Yeah  Wait, wait  Wait, start this over  Oh, yeah, let me hear some  Oh, no, I love this song  Karaoke contest  I have got a new life  You would hardly recognize me  I'm so glad  I'm a new person  Like you  Dreaming you  A good body  You're not the one for me  Is enough enough 
[02:16:00]  I saw the sign  And it opened up my eyes  I saw the sign  Life is demanding  Without understanding  I saw the sign  It opened up my eyes  I saw the sign  No one's gonna drag you up  To get into the light  Where you belong  Where you do you belong  All whispery  That is so fucking good  But you know how many 
[02:16:30]  Karaoke tracks I had to listen to  Before I found her  Before that bit of gold  I'm sure there's a lot  That's just as good as that  I saw the sign  That horrible long round accent  And it opened up my eyes  We should play tap out  Where we just bring in every jingle  And just, you guys keep going  Alright, you want to hear them all  Keep going until you tap  You want to challenge my OCD  Are you fucking crazy  Let's do it  Yeah, I'd say let's do it  Let's do it  I heard those annoying sounds  I had a CD  A data CD  Just burnt  Just packed 
[02:17:00]  And I listened to all of them  On a ride  Going back from Montauk  To Queens  It was two and a half hours  Of annoying sounds  Brutal  Fucking kidding me  Jesus  That's awesome  It sucked  Between the Long Island Expressway  And that  You must have fucking  Wanted to kill somebody  Dude, my chick at the time  Was in the car  And she's just like  Do you have to do this now?  I'm like, well, I'm like  What's a better time to do this?  Like, I want to do it later  I'm stuck in traffic  I might as well do this now  It was two and a half straight hours  Pretty much  Yeah  You know, because it wasn't an audio CD 
[02:17:30]  You know, where it's just like 70 minutes  It was just packed full of dinosaurs  That's hilarious  Now I'm going to have that fucking song  Stuck in my head also  With everything else  Fucking Manfredi  Dinosaur  What song?  I don't know what you're talking about  Oh, yeah  I think it was  We are the dinosaurs  Marching  Marching  We are the dinosaurs  What do you think of that?  We are the dinosaurs  Marching  Marching  We are the dinosaurs  We make the earth flat 
[02:18:00]  We make the earth flat  That's great  That's a good one  It was the  Always girl  It's so goofy  Every time  A bunch of studio musicians in there  What is that?  It's like a porcupine 
[02:18:30]  I want to pet it  It's a little porcupine  Look at it  It's adorable  Why is he on the fucking  Squawk Box  CNBC  Stock Channel  Squawk Box  That should be every woman's name  It's a little porcupine  It's adorable  Love it 
[02:19:00]  That's great  Love it  So where were we?  Oh, Don Lemon  Thank you, Danny  We'll play the jingles awkwardly in about ten minutes  Hey, I just brought him in  Don Lemon is going at it with Jonah Hill  Just making something out of nothing  He just wants a little of that Twitter beef  You know  Nothing better than a good Twitter war though, man  Nothing better when those things flare up 
[02:19:30]  I love them  Don Lemon got upset because he saw Jonah Hill  Yeah  And he said  He stopped and said  Oh, I like you  You're funny  And Jonah Hill didn't respond friendly enough  That's what this is about?  Like he said thank you  And shook Don Lemon's hand  But Don Lemon said that Jonah treated him like he was just part of the help  Who's Don Lemon?  He's the dumb CNN guy  Oh boy, part of the help  What is he?  Is he playing the card?  Is he playing the card? 
[02:20:00]  And then Jonah was like responding to him on Twitter  He's like, I don't know exactly what you want from me  Do you want me to move in with you?  And Don Lemon is also a gay guy  And so he goes  Oh shit  Sorry bro  Not my type  Ah  Nailed him  Jonah Hill was just like  Fuck  He got me  Nailed him right there  Not my type  Nothing worse than getting white  Gotten  I got a cock  It's like why  I got a cock  That's what I would have said  I would have just grabbed it  And said what about this heavy package? 
[02:20:30]  You gotten  I'll deliver this package right where the shit comes out  I'll put my package in your mailbox  Yeah  Yeah  Jonah Hill said  I walked out of the restroom  And I found you waiting for me  Shook hands  And said hi  And then was on my way  I'm sorry if you found that rude  Yeah  What else does he want?  I don't know  Oh, you're the guy from CNN  You think that's one of the things  He didn't get recognized?  He's bothered?  Of course he is  So then what? 
[02:21:00]  Don Lemon on his dumb show  Talked about it  Of course  Because then CNN  He's a news guy  Yeah  And then CNN  Shut up and read the news  CNN makes this big deal  Like oh  We have a Twitter beef on our hands  But we're just trying to latch on to Jonah Hill's  Yeah  Make something of it  Famousness  We had a little issue with Jonah Hill  But I take his side completely  Look at the bobcat  Oh my god  I thought it was the comedian  I lay here  I meow  Dude  You got your litter box 
[02:21:30]  You got your fucking paws  Oh my paw man  Why don't we  Oh my paw man  Why don't we get the cats in anymore?  Look how cute that thing is  Ah  That's a very pretty cat  Oh my god  But if the squawk box got it  Why don't we have it?  Exactly  Is that a bobcat?  Yeah it's a bobcat  I would fucking just pet it  Isn't that thing cool?  Just looks like a giant house cat  That thing would really pound you  Oh imagine playing with it  Like you play with a cat  And he scratches you  It does that thing where it rolls over on its back  Grabs you with the front claws  And then does that high speed 
[02:22:00]  Rear claw fucking shred thing  Imagine not doing it  You think that would hurt?  Holy fuck  Your arm would be gone  You'd be holding shredded hamburger meat  I've seen regular cats that big though  So how do you know the difference?  No no no  Look at that one  See from this angle  That's a big fucking  I've seen cats almost that big  I'm telling you  That is just a beautiful aminal  You know what dude?  The dogs chase you  You go  I'm a bobcat dude  I think the compound needs some exotic pets  Exotic pets would be cool  Oh that would be great 
[02:22:30]  If you had a tiger chained up in your backyard  Like Scarface  I've got a tiger chained up out there  Look let me show you  And then I fucking swagger over  Take it to the limit  Yeah take it to the limit  Sounds like a four inch chain  Yeah  Tiger had no room to move  Yeah I'm pointing tiger  I mean you got  That's my tiger  You already have Daniel Craig naked in your pool  But then you got exotic pets  No he wasn't naked in my pool  Now you're talking  Exotic pets would be cool  Now that's a compound  Exotic pets  I want  I want  I want  A small  Big cat  Like a bobcat  It'd be cool 
[02:23:00]  Something like that  Not a big tiger  Or a lion  That's just too much  They'll just eat your face eventually  Oh of course they will  I don't want like an alligator  Yeah you should have one alligator in the pool  In the pool  That'd be fucking awesome  That would be kind of cool  To have an alligator in the pool  A little one  Okay  One alligator in the pool  You know it's going to bite  But it's not going to like  You know  And then every now and then  The alligator would come out of the pool  Like in Florida  Yeah it just suns itself on the deck and stuff  That'd be fucking cool shit  Let's get you an alligator  I want a monkey  I want a monkey  Yeah 
[02:23:30]  They throw shit everywhere  I would love to  No no I would love to have a monkey though  But they throw shit everywhere  I'd love to own a monkey  Oh  No they were fucking cool  I'd dress them up in a  In a  Engineer  A train engineer suit  With the suspenders  And the coveralls  And the little  Engineer hat  A diaper  Because they just shit  Yeah you know  You teach them to fucking  Farm  Can you imagine having to  Change a diaper  A monkey diaper  It's all hairy  Oh my god  Throwing them with four limbs  I wouldn't do it  I'd have a fucking 
[02:24:00]  Living housekeeper  A monkey handler  Takes care of the monkey  Yeah  Change my monkey's diaper  You fucking bitch  That's what I'm saying  That's what I'm telling her  Why wouldn't you be polite  Change my monkey's shitty diaper  Don Lemon would be so pissed at you  If you treated him like that  Why don't we play  The Don Lemon clip  From CNN  Don Lemon  This guy seems to be  Wound a bit tight  No  Not that tight  If you know what I mean  Well at first  When I tweeted  I just wanted to get it  Off my chest  It was kind of funny  He's a comedian 
[02:24:30]  But I'd just gotten back  From covering the election  I'll go quickly  And I was stuck in an airport  For six hours  In Cincinnati  Because the cab driver  Wanted to take a picture  With me  As I was getting out of the car  I missed the cut off  By one minute for my bag  And I'm not  Listen  Jonah Hill doesn't owe me anything  And he may have been  Having a bad day  But Jonah Hill  Treated me like the help  When I said  I was basically  Wanted to say  I like you  I think you're funny  I didn't remember his name  I was checking out of the hotel  Waiting for my bags  And he walked by 
[02:25:00]  I don't know where he was going  And I said  And he just kind of walked  Just kind of like  Oh  I study people  When you say  I don't know where he was going  You knew exactly where he was going  And you were basically stalking him  Because you're like  Holy fuck  That's Jonah Hill  And he said he didn't know his name  That's the one  He said he didn't know his name  That again is another obvious  He's lying  There's two things in there  I didn't remember his name  He knows his name  I'm CNN's Don Lemon  Yeah he knows his name  And he was basically stalking him  Which a lot of us do  You see someone famous  You're like  Holy fuck  I'm going to kind of stalk him 
[02:25:30]  For a little bit  Donnie Lemon  Donnie Lemon  I want to see where he's going  Or maybe I could  Get a quick high in  That's exactly what he was doing  He was doing exactly what we all do  And he got his feelings hurt  Of course he did  Because he's not famous  Like Jonah Hill is  And someone like Jonah Hill  Has to deal with this  Everywhere he goes  Of course  He was going  And I said  And he just kind of walked  Just kind of like  Oh and then like  I was the help  And so then he walked back  And I said  Maybe you misunderstood  I just wanted to tell you  I think you're really funny  And he just kind of went like  You know gave me the wet handshake 
[02:26:00]  Like oh  And just like  And walked away  What did this guy want?  What the fucking baby?  First of all yeah  He could have been having a bad day  Whatever the fuck  No he's not  He gets that  Everywhere he goes  He got a handshake  Yeah he  It wasn't a blow off  He shook  After Jonah Hill  Washed his hands  He went and shook  This stranger's hand  Oh man  That's above and beyond  Yeah it is  Look I've watched  This Don Lemon  A little bit here and there  Oh  What are you saying  Opie  Opie's got a crush  Let's say he was  Over your house 
[02:26:30]  And Sam says  His fucking shorts  Come off  Alright he's wearing  Board shorts  Yeah and you tug  His pecker  What  God Chip  He's having fun  The guy comes across  A bit full of himself  Of course  And he really  Full of someone else  He's a bit full of himself  This is a non-moment  That he's trying to make  Into something  And now we're talking  About it as well  See  But Jonah Hill  Probably was more  Than cordial to him  Success  You know gave me  The wet handshake  Like oh  And just like 
[02:27:00]  And walked away  And so the bellman  Looked at me  And I looked at the bellman  And I said  What's that guy's name  And he said Jonah Hill  And I went  Oh and he goes  Oh yeah right  And so  It normally doesn't bother me  But you were done  Six hours  Any airplane  But I was done  Because I had been taught  By my mother  To always be kind to people  Shut up  Your mother of course  One  One  Who else  Who else  Was overbearing on you  Gave you much too much  Fucking affection  I don't know  What kind of kindness  He wants  How much kind 
[02:27:30]  We've all gotten  Handshakes that were  A little bit like  Yeah yeah yeah  Like he probably got  A dismissive handshake  The wet fish handshake  Yeah like you know  I understand that  But who cares  You don't even make  Anything of it  You just go  Oh well  If these guys  That are really famous  Actually famous  Had to like stop  And give everyone  That moment  They would never  Get anything done  During the day  He's gotta get on his plane  He's in an airport  This guy is so  You know how many times  That happened to Jonah Hill  That day  Especially if you're  In an airport  A public place like that  Well they were in the hotel  I think  So he probably did 
[02:28:00]  The best he could  But Don Lemon  I think expected him  To be recognized  Like oh you're Don Lemon  From CNN  That's something like that  Jonah Hill is very recognized  Don Lemon's a sour puss  Yeah he is  Get it  No  Lemon  Sour  Puss  Oh sour lemon  Puss  Cause he's  Just throwing him out there  Got it  Just throwing him out  I would hate it  I would hate it  Imagine if the fly  Got hit to him  And the ball  Got dropped  Cause they would say  Ah Lemon drops it  Oh that'd be good  How funny though  If he got AIDS 
[02:28:30]  Lemon AIDS  Maybe not funny  Well wordplay  It's just wordplay  It's the jingles  That we're gonna play  I want to apologize  I never meant to wish  Any diseases  On Don Lemon  I apologize  Before anybody  Even says  He wants some kindness  Please  Thank you  You're supposed to get  A savannah cat  A savannah cat  And I want to get  An African  Is it an African tortoise 
[02:29:00]  Ah a bunch of listeners  I said  Would I move even slower  Jesus  I want a pet  For my son  And they're suggesting  I think it was  The African tortoise  Yeah  But then you gotta worry  About salmonella  What really  I think so  From a tortoise  Yeah you gotta worry  About that shit  So I don't wanna bring  Salmonella into my house  Willingly  Salmonella  But that's what they said  With the turtles  And the tortoises  You gotta worry about that shit  Is that true  And is it the African tortoise

[02:30:30]  Savannah kitten  That could be the  Cutest thing on the  Internet  Right there  How big do they get  Savannah cats  20 feet long  Oh I would have  Thought smaller  No  That's big  This is Dr. Steve's  Co-host I'm being told  Yeah  Oh okay  Your voice just isn't  As recognizable  As Dr. Steve's  Oh he's gonna tweet you  Like John Lemon  John Lemon did  Yeah the Savannah cat  So what's up with the  Savannah cats  Do they rip your eyes out  When you're sleeping at night  Apparently they're supposed  To be like a dog  You take them for walks  On a leash  They're very gentle 
[02:31:00]  That's what I'm reading  About them  We're looking at  Hold on  We're looking at  Pictures of the  Savannah cat  For the people out there  And they're on their  Big  Their hind legs  And they're about  They're about  Four feet tall  Their hind legs  Yeah  When they're standing  Like that  Is that considered  A house cat  Or a wild one  That's a house cat  It's gotta fuck you up  If a regular cat  Fucks you up  A Savannah cat  Is gonna fuck you up  Pretty good  Yeah  Yeah I'm assuming  If you piss it off  Yeah  True  Yeah but you don't even 
[02:31:30]  Know what you do wrong  With these stupid cats  I had cats  That fucking thing  They're lunatics  That's crazy  It's as big as a kid  Didn't you have cats  That just fucking  Would be in a bad mood  Out of nowhere  A Siamese cat  Named Jade  It was crazy  You could do everything  Perfect and it still  Has a problem with you  It was the nastiest  Fucking cat  Siamese cats are crazy  Anyway  Right  With them big  Crazy blue eyes  Who would just look  And charge out at you  You'd walk down the hallway  And would just charge out  At your ankle  You're being stalked  In your own house 
[02:32:00]  It's wonderful  Don't you yell at the cat  Like don't you realize  I'm feeding you  You asshole  What are you doing  You stupid fuck  But these are obviously nice  It looks like they're nice  Cats are not nice  Yeah my cat  Very unpredictable  Looks nice  But he just like  He'll just walk up to you  And then he'll kind of  Nuzzle you a little bit  And then swipe at you  Not swipe  He jumps at me  And he grabs my arm  With his two claws  And then just chomps his teeth in  Oh you have  Who has a Savannah cat  No it's not a Savannah cat  Just his regular cat  Why don't you  Throw it outside 
[02:32:30]  Well I throw him off the couch  But he's a sweet pie  I would declaw it  And put it out in the wild  Why would you declaw it  And then put it out in the wild  To show him who's boss  You want to get a lesson  Taught to you cat  Yeah  You want to be a tough guy  Well good luck  Out in the wild  Without claws  You asshole  I was the one feeding you  Yeah that's exactly  What I would do  You'd just be sitting there  Scratched up all day  Like I shouldn't have  Fucking scratched that guy  Why would you scratch  The person that's  Taking care of you  I know  It can't get it's own  Food in your house  You have to give it the food  Plus cuddles 
[02:33:00]  They also  They are compared to  Dogs in loyalty  That was true  And they can be trained  To walk on a leash  And even fetch  And a lot of them  Are reported to be  Social and friendly  With new people  While others may run and hide  Or revert to hissing  And growling  It depends on  Exposure to people  And pets when they're kittens  And it's an often noted trait  They can jump very high  Some can jump eight feet  From the standing position  Are you talking about  Cats or the retarded  The retarded Savannah cats  They bark  They said many of them 
[02:33:30]  Don't fear  They're so cute  They're very inquisitive  And have been known  To get into all sorts of things  They often learn  How to open doors  And cupboards  And anyone buying a Savannah  Will likely need to take  Special precautions  To prevent the cat  From getting into things  They're inquisitive  Hi I'm a cat  What is this  Oh is this a dresser drawer  Oh is this a chest of drawers  Where's my cat treats 
[02:34:00]  Oh there they are  I'll get them  They're very inquisitive  Very inquisitive  Who are you  What are you doing here  What's your relationship  With my owner  What's in your parents  They're busy bodies  They really are  They're nosy bodies  Fuck you  You nosy body  Get your own  Fucking cat food  I had four cats  In my life  And one was cool  And the other three  Were assholes 
[02:34:30]  Meow your tears away  Meow your tears away  Anne had a cool cat too  We talk about JD  Every once in a while  JD  Was an amazing cat  It would play fetch  And shit  JD  And he's dead now  And the rest of the cats  Were assholes  Right  For the most part  Yeah  Yeah  The rest of them  Yeah  Oh no  Oh no  Suspended for cuteness  For adorableness pictures  Oh boy  Crazy  Well thanks PA John  You guys have a good day  Yeah  You can't own them 
[02:35:00]  In the city of New York  What  You can own them  In the state  Savannas are more  Than five generations  Wait  That are more  Savannas  More than five generations  From the serval  Yeah  Are allowed to be owned  In New York State  But not in the city of New York  I guess the serval  Means five generations  Removed from the wild  I'm guessing  Right  Yeah  Dr. Steve  What happened  Tweeted me about that  Yeah  Savannah cats  Very adorable  Leaps very high  F1 is the  Hybrid generation number 
[02:35:30]  F1  The first generation  After breeding  Between two species  Oh so those are the ones  You probably can own  An F5  In New York State  But not the city  The one that's closest  Yeah  Like a lot of times  The F1 of my wine  Would be grapes and urine  That's the F1  It's the closest generation  Then you water it down  With things like  Liquid feces 
[02:36:00]  And honey  And liquefied toenail clippings  That doesn't sound very good at all  Oh no  What's it doing  Well that's a sphinx kitten  That's so cool  It's a cat in the water  But he's in the tub  Is that a fucking kangaroo  He's in a tub  He's standing on his hind legs  But then he's doggy paddling  With his front paws  Oh he has no fucking heart  What does he have cancer  No he doesn't  No he's a sphinx  A sphinx  Does he have cancer  It's a cat with cancer  Oh no  How cute  I just want to fucking kiss him 
[02:36:30]  Oh that's adorable  He's just frolicking in the water  Fucking kangaroo  Creepy cancer  Kangaroo cat  Hop I'm sick  Hop I'm sick  Fucking  Hop cough  Hop cough  What the  How big do those sphinx cats get  Just like I think  Regular cat size pretty much  I want to have a cat again  You had one  I grew up with cats  That generation thing  My cat is a first generation  Feral cat  Like his mom was just  On a street  What does that mean  A feral  And so now he bites 
[02:37:00]  And he doesn't clean his asshole  You have a cat that doesn't  Clean his own asshole  Why don't you get in there  And do it  That's all cats do  They eat and clean their asshole  He doesn't clean his asshole  Enough I should say  Oh no  Why do you have this  Huh  Why do you have this thing  I like him  His name is Bruiser Brody  You don't really like him  I do like him  And it attacks you  I want to know about  Yeah with a shit ass  He bites you and has a  Shitty caked asshole  We take a little wet nap  And help him out  Oh god  You clean your cat's asshole  Why have an animal  You gotta do that to 
[02:37:30]  He must love that  Fuck that  Does he hate it  Yeah yeah he does  He hates it  You gotta pin him down  Yeah you go  With his tail  And wipe his asshole  With the fucking wet nap  You gotta hold him  But he knows  I'm sure I suck on the wet nap  I'm sure he doesn't  Try to claw at you  As you clean his asshole  No  What a nightmare  He knows that  I'm his dad  And you know  We take care of him  We had a Manx cat  With the little short tails  Those are the best  Because they don't  Swim over the asshole  Yeah  A little short stubby tail  Did you like growing up  With cats  I did  John was my favorite 
[02:38:00]  Jess always makes him  Jess always says  Say a paper towel  Paper towel  Because he goes  And he walks up to her lap  And wants to sit down  And sometimes  He'll sit down on Jess  And on her pajama pants  And then he'll get up  And there's a little  Cat turd stain  Jesus fucking Christ  I bet you she likes  When he makes  Little cat biscuits  That's probably why  My mother used to say  The cat was making biscuits  When it's kneading  He was making biscuits  Is that why she  Claws him onto her lap  When Sam's not getting  The job done  She's like  Come here  Make some biscuits  He doesn't knead 
[02:38:30]  On her vagina  And that would be painful  He's got claws  He leaves shit stains  On her feet  First of all  What kind of PJs  Does she wear  With legs  Yeah  Why would you allow  That in the house  So she doesn't get  Shit on her leg  As they're lounging around  Like after work  She'll come home  And put pajamas on  That's not necessarily  What she sleeps in  How did you get  A fucking feral cat  At the humane society  Meow meow  Shake it up  Shake it up  Meow  Scott feral cat  Yeah  Scott feral cat  Why did you  Choose one 
[02:39:00]  That was fucking wild  Because it was cheap  What did you pay  Five bucks for it  Like free kittens  Or something  Oh  Oh you want for the  Free kittens  He was an adorable kitten  Adorable  They all start  Adorable  They trick us  So they shitty ass  Bite you  Big paws  And blue eyes  Dude they trick you  With their cuteness  Why does he pause  Why does he just get to it  And even their nails  Don't hurt  When they're kittens  Oh yeah  Fast forward a year  And they're a nightmare  For everybody  Their cute kittens  Till they grow up  And their tail rolls back  And they put shit 
[02:39:30]  On your pajamas  I'll never put on  Pajama bottoms again  No wet nap  Had been sent  I like him  But Jess gets really  Frustrated with him  Because when we'll have  Yes she does  Ope's kid over  Or whatever  Like when the family  Comes by  She has to watch him  And we have to lock  The cat up  Because obviously  You know  Ope's kid  Will want to go  And pet the cat  But we don't really  Trust that he won't  Jump up and bite him  What the fuck  Are you doing  But he's a good  He's a good  No it's not  And he throws up  Like four times 
[02:40:00]  Five times a week  The hairball thing  Where it's  No he goes  He's a big fat cat  He's a giant fat cat  An executive  And he goes  And he stuffs his face  With cat food  And then he walks away  From his dish  And throws up  He's an idiot  You have a horrid cat  He's a great cat  Though he's fun  Terrible cat  He's got personality  It's over Johnny  Personality  The cat stinks  When I was little  I used to say  My cat didn't have personality 
[02:40:30]  He had catnality  He was very cute of me  Oh fuck  I was saying to my mother  Does John have catnality  Young Jimmy's getting  Less and less cute  As the years go on  You don't think that's cute  No  Do you think  You think your mom  Fast forwarded a few years  And realized  That the catnality kid  Would still be living  In her house  Bringing prostitutes home  In her basement  She probably didn't understand  The juxtaposition  Of those two people  You have trannyality 
[02:41:00]  You know  Sticking with the formula  I understood  We all got it  Does John have catnality  You just like  Making it hurt a little more  Of course  Does our cat have catnality  No  Okay good  I'm gonna go sniff  A girl's panties  Who's pissed herself  Stretch that girl  Had fucking  So Jess hates the cat  Right  Jess is not as big  A Bruiser Brody fan  As I am  Bruiser Brody  It's time  No  She wanted the cat  Your mom will take care  Of the cat  No she's already got  Meaning the cat's old age 
[02:41:30]  So give her the cat  I'm Bruiser Brody  I'm Bruiser Brody  You get a pet  You don't just  If it acts bad  You don't give it away  You pet  You get a pet  How many years  Did you give it  We've had him  For four years  You could fucking  Get rid of it  Exactly  That's right  Four years  You gave it  A fair chance  I want those beaches  Open Bruiser Brody  Me and my ex  Had a couple cats  And we went on  A quick vacation  And we got home  And the cat was gone  And she lost her shit 
[02:42:00]  And I went  Oh that sucks  Anyway what do you want  For dinner  Did you ever find it  Oh I didn't go  Looking for it  No  But she certainly did  Never found it  And brought the animal back  Oh where was it  I don't know  Somewhere in the neighborhood  I couldn't be bothered  Bruiser Brody's got a tag  With her phone number on it  And he doesn't even  Leave the house  Why don't we break  We got a  Bruiser Brody  Bruiser Brody's a cunt  Yeah it's a shit smelling  Shitty ass  Rotten fucking animal  Does it just smell like shit  When it's near you  No no no  He doesn't  We make sure that he

[02:54:30]  On the John Jay and Rich Facebook page  Right  Some of their fans are wishing them  A happy belated Jacktober  Oh nice  That's pretty nice  Nice  That's very nice of them  I can check my little schedule  And see what I can do for you  What about  What if I wanted to do  What books do you read  What books do you bring  I can read  Whatever you want  I can read you the phone book 
[02:55:00]  In my mermaid costume  If you wanted me to  Cool  How much does that cost?  Well  Do you have an hourly rate?  We actually don't need to talk  About money right now  All you need to know  Is that you leave it on the table  And we'll figure the rest of that out  Leave it on the table?  You're right  They're blowing the bit  They're not playing  Honestly  She's doing pretty good  She's very good  She's turning  My fucking dick is plumping 
[02:55:30]  It is?  Yeah  Pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump  I had this conversation many times  She's doing her role very well  Those guys are completely blowing it  They stink  She's supposed to say something in there  Where it's like  Wait a minute  They're not talking about kid parties  Oh my god  And then the fucking father jumps in  Yeah  Oh what are you talking about?  This is your father  Oh I can't wait for his over the top disappointment  Well unfortunately  Dad  It's a long piece of audio 
[02:56:00]  Yeah  It's like 10 minutes long  Keep going  Let's rock  At least to the reveal  Let's rock it  Does that sound okay to you?  Sure  Good  So you're not available for kids parties then?  For kids?  Uh huh  Um  How old are the kids?  34 and 35  What? 
[02:56:30]  34 and 35?  Yeah  I do kid parties for 35 year olds  Do you read any Dr. Seuss books?  I can read anything  Pause again  What is this?  And I'm sorry  But  The father would jump in at that point  Why did he say you're not available for kids parties?  This is  Because they had  They got to get to the reveal  And they didn't know how to do it  So bad  And then it's obvious  Now it's obvious  To  Even the dopes out there  That she's a stripper  And the father's still not talking  This doesn't make any sense 
[02:57:00]  So frustrating  Say it right Ant  That don't make no sense  That don't make no sense  This is Boulder Dash  They're just lazy  Like this is a scripted bit  Yeah  You could have made this make sense  Right  Yeah  You know what I mean?  It's not like there should be things coming at them  That they're unexpected  Yeah  There's another way where the guy could be talking  Like he is talking about kids parties  But he didn't give that indication whatsoever  Yeah  So how many different costumes do you bring?  Could you do a few costume changes?  Right  I'm expecting there's going to be about 
[02:57:30]  Yeah  Fifteen or sixteen there  Exactly  Do you have balloons with you?  Can you make balloon animals?  Exactly  What?  Yeah I guess  Yeah  I mean  Exactly  Would you be willing to read Dr. Seuss?  Yeah  Can you sing?  We're going to want a couple of songs  They went right into it with the assumption that she was a stripper  Right  And she like is reacting to that  This is so bad  Now it's obvious  Like I said  She's a stripper for the bit  And the father's still waiting  For his turn 
[02:58:00]  And he's sitting there like  I'm much stronger on improv  I don't need to write any of this  I just go with it as we keep going  He'll wing it  More importantly though  LiveLeak fucking putting it up on their site  Like it's a real thing  It's kind of sad  What's going on there?  They should know better  Pop  Oh I read Hop on Pop  Don't you worry  Fox and Socks  Green Eggs and Ham  Are you my mother? 
[02:58:30]  I can be anybody you want  Nobody would talk to you this long on the phone  No no no  I was just thinking about that  I had a feeling you wanted to book something tonight  What time do you want me there?  From 3pm till 11.30pm  8 and a half hours  That's 7 and a half hours  8 and a half  Are you sure you're up for that big boy?  Are you sure you're up for it?  And the father's still not talking?  No  And he's supposed to talk the whole thing?  Nonsense  Yeah  What's an hour cost? 
[02:59:00]  Uh  I don't talk money over the phone baby  We're going to have to do that in person  Hang on just a second  Let me put you on hold  All right  What the hell  This is them discussing things?  It's weird  I had to go do some stuff  Okay  Holy shit  This is awful  See you don't do kids parties 
[02:59:30]  Well I told you  It depends on how old the kids are  If the kids are legal  I can do any kind of party you want  You want me to treat you like a little  Would you talk to my friend?

Oh I don't know  Who the fuck knows?  Who the fuck knows?  It's terrible  Not your concern is it  Jesus Christ 
[03:09:30]  Um  Over the weekend  I was watching the History Channel  And uh  There is a show on called  The Men Who Made America  Nice  And it's about the Rockefellers  And um  And uh  Like uh  The Vanderbilts  Nice  Uh Henry Ford  All these guys  That built this country  Um  The idea guys  The industrialists  All those guys  And I'm watching this  And realizing  Every single one of these guys 
[03:10:00]  Was a  Backstabbing scumbag  Uh  But  That's how it was  You know  That was like  Part of the deal  Yeah  They weren't doing anything for  Like  To make things better  You see  Some of the pictures on there  Facebook are hilarious  They're a crazy show man  With these pictures  That are popping up  On their Facebook page  Sam Roberts  And all I was thinking is  Yeah  They all came up with  I mean  Some of the greatest inventions 
[03:10:30]  Some of the  Amazing infrastructure  We have in this country  Um  Fuel  Railroads  All that great stuff  In this day and age  With the  The  And I'll say  You know  The left  The way it is now  They never would have  Been able to do  Any of that  They would have been  Hated  Because they were  White  Powerful  Rich  And  And ruthless  And uh  Yet  If it wasn't for that  They never would have  We never would have 
[03:11:00]  What we have now  You gotta be a prick  They  But  But  But  They always talk about  You really do have to be a prick  How  How many times have you heard them  Talk about like  And you know  The  The wonder of this country  And this has always been a  A great country  With amazing technology  And  And work  But they never want to  Address the fact that  That's  When this country was made  That's how it got made  Into a great country  These guys weren't doing this  To help people  They were doing it  To get fucking rich  Oh it was  It had a lot to do with greed 
[03:11:30]  The fucking  Absolutely  One thing that  Vanderbilt  I was watching Vanderbilt last night  What he did  He owned the only railroad bridge  Coming into New York City  So everyone had to use  His fucking bridge  So the rest of the railroads  That had to use his bridge  Were trying to fuck him over  And screw him on a deal  He goes  Alright  Fuck you  Closes the bridge  So now none of them  Can get any of their shit  Into Manhattan  So their stocks  Start to plummet  What does he do  When that happens  Buys up their fucking stock  Until he owns  All the railroads 
[03:12:00]  And then opens up  The bridge again  What a prick  And then opens the bridge up  Yeah  Just fuck it  And they were all  And then someone  Fucked him over  So he double fucked them back  It's a fuck fest  That's how you did business  It was amazing  And then one other  Yeah look at this guy  That guy  They show him  Building a pipeline  It's him and a bunch of guys  Screwing together pipes  Across some fucking plains  Like they didn't look at  The ecological impact  They didn't get a permit  For it  It's like here's the oil  We want the oil to go there 
[03:12:30]  Let's put a pipe in  And we don't give a fuck  What animals are in our way  Don't give a shit  About anything  Fuck them all  You think the days are behind us  Where we build these amazing things  Yes  There's too much bureaucracy  You'll get a cool building built  Every once in a while  Oh buildings go up very easily  Lickety splits  Yeah but I mean  These giant projects  These giant projects  Are long gone  These innovative things  The things that haven't been done before  You just don't see it happening  In this day and age 
[03:13:00]  There's too much shit  In the way of innovation and stuff  And then the other thing I noticed  As I was watching that  You're watching these men  That fucking  The ideas they came up with  The way they executed it  The balls that it took  Real fucking men  Building this country  And it's the History Channel  Then a commercial comes on  And it sums up  What today is  Perfectly  Perfectly  I'm watching this  It's amazing  And then a commercial comes on  Uh  Chumley clocked in late 
[03:13:30]  At the pawn shop today  And I'm just going  Really?  Chumley clocked in late  Is  That sums up  2012  As opposed to  What I was watching  Fucking Vanderbilt  And Rockefeller  And Henry Ford  Chipperson  Chipperson  The wonderful Chipperson  Yeah man  They were all in it  For the money  All about  Cash and power  But we benefited  You know  As a society  But that wasn't 
[03:14:00]  Their main goal  No  They knew they could  Make money  They knew  Lots of it  It improved  To the country  But that was not  Their first fucking goal  You've been to the Vanderbilt  Out there on Long Island  Right?  Sure  That was just one of many  Fucking huge  Ridiculous mansions  That they had  Mansions  They were beyond rich  And womanchins  Oh those two  Boy  It's just  I gotta check out the show  It's on the History Channel  Yeah  The men who built America  And it really just  You realize how fucking far 
[03:14:30]  We've come from that time  Are they not sugarcoating it  Are they basically  Showing you that  They were assholes  I think so  Sure  Oh they're basically  Showing you that  They were all just like  They were really hungry  For money  Right  You get someone like  Henry Ford  Who was a little more  You know  For the work in Joe  And kind of had ideas  And knew they'd help  The country  But a lot of these guys  Were just like  How much fucking money  Can I make off of this  You know  Robert Moses  With his fucking 
[03:15:00]  The Rhodes  The suburban roadways  And highways  And shit like that  It's just  That shit's gone  It's fucking gone  Long gone  And I can't see it  Coming back  Because there's just  Too many obstacles now  In the way of that  These guys just did shit  They just fucking did shit  And they employed  A lot of people right  Oh fuck yeah man  Yeah yeah  Do they treat them right  Oh they probably shit  All over them  Sure  They probably shit  On their workers  But that's where  The unions originally came from 
[03:15:30]  And that's  You know  That helped  At that moment  Until it went  Way the other way  Right  But it's  The innovation is amazing  The brain power  To figure out  How to do things  That were never done before  They were just  They were just like  Guys doing shit  And now  Just every obstacle  Red tape  Bureaucracy  Political correctness  Two party system  All that shit  Is standing in the way  Of all this  The greatness 
[03:16:00]  That this country  Was built on  John wants to add  To this discussion  In North Carolina  John  Toby, Anthony, Jimmy  How you guys doing  Hey man  How are you  Hey  We got a  Vanderville house  Out here in Nashville  North Carolina  Do you  Oh yeah  This guy was so rich  And powerful  When he was building  His house  He himself  Was 25%  Of our nation's GDP  Oh my god  How are you doing  That's pretty good  And we don't even have  A guy that's worth 
[03:16:30]  1%  No  Not even close  25%  Yeah those mansions  Are everywhere  Oh yeah  Vanderbilt just built  Fucking Vanderbilt  Mansions everywhere  All over the fucking place  Yeah  Rich guy  Powerful guy  Loved his money  Loved power  Loved the  Business dealings  And screwing people  How did a guy  Like that come up  How did he become  The guy  I think it was just  Right place  Right time  He saw an opportunity  Yeah these guys  A wide open opportunity  Yeah you know 
[03:17:00]  For every one of these  There's thousands of guys  That just went broke  Trying to do something  But  Yeah  It's just really  It's sad to think  Like you know  You're not going to see  These big names  The closest we got  Is Donald Trump  You know  As one of these guys  And  He's a rock star  I mean come on  He's a rock star  Jesus  You think he's lost  His mind  Oh fuck yeah  You read his tweets  He loves Twitter  More than anyone  He loves  He's a crazy person  Smart guy

[03:26:30]  Well it is  It's a kettlebell day  Yay  I didn't get my juice the other day  Because the woman  Juice  Was behind the counter  That hates making those juices  She loves making  I saw her that day  I'm like hi  She goes hi Jim  She loves Jimmy  She loves Jim  I can't stand my face  How's that happen?  I don't know  Because I warned Jimmy about it  I'm like Jimmy man  There's one that you're going to have a problem with  We like to point this out to each other  She's the nicest lady in town  And it turns out  She loves Jimmy  She lost everything in the fucking storm too  I feel bad for her 
[03:27:00]  Oh really?  Oh really?  Yeah  I hope he doesn't care  When I order juice  She aggressively rips out a receipt  So she can write down my order  And then slams her hand down like this  Oh my god  And starts writing down the ingredients  And I swear I did nothing  And what does she say to Jimmy?  Except order the juice  She loves them  She has chit chats  She knows my card number offhand  Wow  She just knows it by memory  She memorized your card number?  Yeah my card number  She's got to be a fan or something  No  Because there's no way she could treat two people  So opposite 
[03:27:30]  She's just  Maybe she's just very insightful  I mean  I don't go about my life that way  But I mean it's a fair point by you  Can we start the show with you  Announcing who the latest re-gift victim had been?  Oh shit  No I don't remember  You gave away something Dr. Steve had given you  Oh the dumb astronomy book  There you go  There you go  That's it  That's dumb astronomy book  That's Dr. Steve's gift 
[03:28:00]  It's called the dumb astronomy book for people with binoculars  Yeah  That's it  It looked too textbook-y and stuff  You didn't even open it  I did  And?  I didn't recognize any of the shit I'm supposed to look at  You would think they would throw Jupiter in there or Saturn  I didn't recognize any of the names of these stars  I'm supposed to be searching in the fucking sky  Just be a short book  Plus I live in Manhattan  You know how much fucking light there is in the sky  You can't see shit  Oh you don't see nothing  You're lucky to see the moon  M-O-O-N 
[03:28:30]  But I appreciate the thought  It was very nice  Do you?  Yeah  I'm getting out of here  Yeah let's go  I'm getting out of here  Yeah let's go  Stay tuned for the Sam Roberts extravaganza I think it's called  I'll take that  Something like that  I don't hold them motherfuckers 
[03:29:00]  I love that old gag  I don't hold them fuckers for a while  I got a joke  These three  I like your fake off air voice  Your on air off air voice  Yes my off air off air voice  What happened Jimmy?  Jimmy's mad  I'm not mad  I just wanted to get her when she came in  I got to fucking  She's doing an interview  Chase her down  Is she here?  Yeah  She can walk right in  She came in at the right time 
[03:29:30]  Where is she?  She's in an interview  Which one?  Where is she?  In the studio  We can wait like 15 minutes  I know  I just wanted to get out of here  I just would have walked over  Gotten it and then  Yeah man  Alright  Jimmy's trying to get a Sally Field picture  Yeah she's a legend man  Sally Field's a legend  Yes she is  I asked three people  And nobody told me  I think she was in  She was in Spider-Man right?  Yeah in the new one  Yeah  What?  Martin Sheen was the father  I'm not meeting with Gary today  I'm going home 
[03:30:00]  I'm not meeting with  I don't want these 10 minute meetings every day  I'm going home  Holy fuck  Open the door  Watch this  Oh no  Okay Opie's  I'll see you in the car Jay  Alright  I'm going  No I'm going home  Oh my god  Oh jeez  Opie just started walking  He's back in the studio  God damn it  I don't want to do this every day  Don't chat with him for 10 minutes  Do your fucking job  He just went out  In the hallway  Where's he now?  He's outside the door waiting for you 
[03:30:30]  He started walking  And then Gary started walking with him  So Opie turned around  And came back in the studio  Here he goes  What time is Chris in?  Go home  Talk to these guys  What time is he in?  No  Could you  Oh jeez  The on air light just fell  Why don't you ask him to come on the air and talk to you  Fuck I want to just go home  See if he'll come on the air and do it  Because now he has to justify why he wasn't doing his job  Fuck  I'm sorry bro  I'll sit here 
[03:31:00]  Are you on strike?  Maybe he'd feel better if he threw something  Dude  Seriously  I'm not  Tell him to go down the hall and do something  And we can't even take a commercial break  Because if we take a commercial break  He'll walk in here  So we're kind of  You can yell through the door  What?  You can yell through the door  What?  I'm not yelling through the door  He said he's not yelling through the door  Do you want to come in a little bit?  He said no thank you  I mean 
[03:31:30]  He only needs 15 minutes  No  And it's 15 minutes of nonsense  Well what if it's  What is this about?  Talk to you when you're off  Two minutes  About what?  120 seconds  That's not too bad  Are you going to justify why you didn't know the contest was falling apart?  It wasn't falling apart  I'll talk to you about it off air  I'm not talking today  I think I made that clear  Well you could just talk on your way out  I mean you got to walk to the elevator 
[03:32:00]  Why not have a little conversation?  It's not 15 minutes  Tell Jimmy  He's  His name's almost on the wall  No his name is not on that wall  He's not on the wall  That's right  After all these years we're going to sketch it in somewhere  So talk to Jimmy about it  Right  And why'd you let Anthony pass by?  It says Opie and Anthony  He snuck out  To be fair to Gary  Anthony snuck out  That's true  Gary likes you  Anthony snuck out  I like Gary as a person  But  You do? 
[03:32:30]  I don't mind him  You do not treat him well  Ah whatever  I don't treat my own mom well  Well  You have a history with her  Roland find out what's going on  Okay  Roland's talking to  This is  This is cutting into my gym time  You and Jim are going somewhere?  So what are you going to do?  I mean  You take a commercial break  And he's coming in here  Plus  Then we can't document it  So  I'd prefer you did not  You taking photos of me Jim? 
[03:33:00]  Always  I like that  Gary is still  I believe he's still outside  Roland is chatting it up  With the talent intern  I don't know what's going to happen  I think Roland is making sure  That Jim Norton  Is taken care of  With the Sally Field photo  That's all I want  She's at 10.45  Because she ran late  10.45  You're not getting your picture  Until 10.45  Oh  Jim  Are you going to stick around for that?  Yeah 
[03:33:30]  Who are you calling?  It's like  I would have just walked out  And got her when she came in  Yeah of course  Who are you calling?  My agent  Tell my agent  I refuse to meet with this guy  Is that right?  Looks like he's in the  OB school of thought  As far as taking your calls go  Yeah  I don't need an explanation  Just fucking make sure  It doesn't happen again  Yeah  Open the door  Is he still out there?  I'm fucking  45 
[03:34:00]  Gary  Yeah  I don't need an explanation  Just make sure  It doesn't happen again  Thank you  Jesus Christ  That's disrespectful  Roland let the door go  I'm glad I was standing  By this microphone  Because that is  Some disrespectful shit  He let the door go  In Gary's face  The guy is just  Trying to do a job  He's trying to manage  The channel  I don't know  I just follow  The on air light  Is now tilted  Because OB slammed the door  And it's tilted over 
[03:34:30]  Jim  Who's a celebrity  Has to sit here  For another  40 minutes  Just for a picture  With goofy Sally Field  I go out there  When they walk in  It takes two seconds  I take a quick one  And I'm done  But that's why  I do it when they come in  So I don't have to wait  45 minutes to an hour  Because they have press  Of course  Who are we calling?  None of your business  It is my business  Why?  Because mind your own business  Okay  Jim is going out  Look  Jimmy gets to walk right by 
[03:35:00]  And Gary doesn't follow him  Why does he have to  Follow me every day?  I hate to tell you something  There's two people  Whose names are on this empire  And you're one of them  You're 50%  Who was that  That didn't pick up?  Mitt  Who didn't pick up?  What are you going to do?  OB what's your move?  Tell him to tell you  And then you tell me  Telephone?  Yes  Tell him  What are you doing? 
[03:35:30]  You got to go tell him  Say OB says  That I need to get the message  What's the explanation?  We're wasting valuable air time  And it's mine too  So you know it's valuable  What's the explanation?  He's going to catch up  With you off the air  No he's not  We're going to see  I hope Gary doesn't quit  I want Gary to win this one  There's nothing to win  Yes there is something to win  How can you explain  That the contest fell through 
[03:36:00]  The fucking cracks today?  Oopsie  How are you going to explain that?  I don't believe it did  He doesn't think it did  You haven't played new entry  Since Wednesday  It's Monday  This is  The irresistible force  Versus the immovable object  Is it really?  Oh yeah  Is it really?  You won't leave the studio  He's not leaving the hallway  My money's on Gary  To win this one  I think you're going to be  Out of this studio  Before he's out of the hallway  And then you know 
[03:36:30]  What's going to happen?  He's going to get that  120 seconds  That he so desires  And deserves  Quite frankly  You got a footprint  On the bottom of your shoe  It's very childlike  Opie Radio on Twitter  Not Sam on Twitter  Opie Radio on Instagram  Not Sam on Instagram  Opie Radio on YouTube  Not Sam on YouTube  And unfortunately  I didn't get Opie Radio  For Facebook  So it's Opie Radio fans  I got primetime Sam Roberts  On Facebook  Eric how are you doing 
[03:37:00]  In there buddy?  I'm good  He's out there  Somewhere laughing  He is  He's cracking up  Of course he is  How did he escape this shit?  Because he snuck out  I'm only going to learn  From him  You snuck out before  This time  You were slow  And guess what happens?  It's 10.50 now  What happened?  Elder Bird gets the word  10.50 on the  Sally Field picture  Jimmy's going to lose  His mind  I know but sometimes  When a guest comes  I can't control it  10.50? 
[03:37:30]  What's she doing?  What show is she doing?  Bob Edwards  Bob Edwards you said?  Jimmy has to wait  Because she's talking  To Bob Edwards  We got to tell him  That's going to drive him nuts  But she's just in a studio  By herself  So go in and take the picture  While she's  Well Bob Edwards is asking  One of those dumb  Long questions  It's taped anyway  Isn't it?  Who are you calling?  Your agent still?  I know I'm calling Anthony  To find out how he got away  It's 10.50 now Jimmy 
[03:38:00]  And she's talking to Bob Edwards  Go walk right in there  He's on an ISDN  He'll never even know  No I know  But uh  How does she look?  She looks really good actually  I just saw her through the glass  She looks very good  I mean considering she was in  She was old in Forrest Gump  Is Gary still outside?  She looks really old in Spider-Man  Does she?  But I think they threw a little  Of that makeup on her too though  Is she supposed to be Aunt May?  Is that the role she plays  In Spider-Man Rowan?  Yeah  Yep 
[03:38:30]  What are you going to do?  Well what I'm going to do is  I'm walking out of this studio  With a video camera on  And I'm going to just film him  That's a good move  And I'm going to post it  So it's up to him  Are you going to tell him  That you're videoing  With the intention to post  Before he speaks?  Go tell him  Just say Obie will be documenting  His trip to the elevator  Via video  Did you hear Rowan mumbling that? 
[03:39:00]  Why does he get so nervous?  Yeah  Obie said he could  A video  Watch out on YouTube  Gary explain on the show  Did he actually?  Gary  Just come in  And talk like a gentleman  I'd be happy to talk to you  Off the air  You can't complain about  Things not working  If you can't have a conversation  About it  And not every conversation  Should be on air  All of it should be on air  Jimmy  Face  I don't want to take  A lot of your time 
[03:39:30]  Two minutes  We're done  I think most of it  Should be on the air  Unless you're talking  About a guy's money  Or something  You know what I mean?  Like how much you make sure  What happened with the contest?  He nailed you  Obie  Your point  I'm not going to do this  On the air  Boom  Well  Then we're not talking  What up yo?  Dude how did you  Escape this shit?  What happened?  Oh you're not listening to Sam?  I'm stuck in the studio  Oh how'd you get stuck  In the studio?  He's trapped  I'm trapped 
[03:40:00]  Because Gary's waiting  For me to discuss  What we were talking about  And somehow  You walked right by him  I went  Which  I went to the left  Outside of the studio  And around  I didn't see any of them  And now he's just  Sitting out there  On his Blackberry  Refuses to come on the air  And discuss it  And Jimmy's pissed  Because he can't get  A Sally Field picture  Until 10.50  It just  Takes two seconds  I love when they say  She's running late  Right  Like they  Like when she's running 
[03:40:30]  It's like  But I don't want to talk to her  Can't somebody  Get him going somewhere else  And then you  Oh no no no  He's right outside the studio  What about this?  What about this?  No no no  For the people that  I'm doing this  For the fucking radio show  Trust me  I'm walking right by him  What about this?  Trust me  And you can be my witness Sam  I'm not talking to him  You have to do it  Before the show ends  Because he doesn't want  To come on the air  And I said  What is your angle  On the  He doesn't think  That the contest  Got fucked up  I'm like okay  So what's your point? 
[03:41:00]  Oh I'll only tell you off air  What the fuck?  Why?  Because not everything  Should be on the air  Here's what you do  I got a great plan  I got a great plan  You know how E-Rock  Would just babble on and on  About something that doesn't matter?  Go send E-Rock  To ask Gary a question  About the worst of  Or something  And while E-Rock  Is just consuming time  You just walk right out  No Sam  That's the pussy way to do it  You watch how I do it  E-Rock can be the 
[03:41:30]  Sacrificial water buffalo  He's even funny from his car  Ladies and gentlemen  No Sam  That's the pussy way  You watch what I do  What's your plan?  My plan is to go home  I did this for the radio  To have a little fun  But now watch what I do  You're going to walk  Directly past him  Yeah  Totally  Are you going to video it?  No I don't need to video it  Wow  Can I document it  You know for the radio?  Yeah of course  Okay  Alright Ann  You're lucky  Put the phone up to me 
[03:42:00]  I will set up a trap  Where you're caught  By this guy next time  And now  Alright good luck  Alright bye  See you tomorrow  Oh this is going to be great  No  He could email me  Yeah but you don't check  Your email remember?  And he can't leave you a message  Right  He couldn't leave you a voicemail  Because you don't have one  What's your plan?  He can't hear us out there  Door shut  Who the fuck is this now? 
[03:42:30]  That's a little tweet  Kenny on 48th street  Told ya  Okay so what's your plan of action?  He can't hear us  He's right here  You gotta talk like you're actually talking to me  Okay  Oh like I'm talking to you like right now  We got a lot of stuff going on  Uh  Opie is there in the  Okay  Opie just walked right by  Roland  Watch him  Yeah he's right  Is he walking really quickly down the hall?  It's really rude  Gary's trying to walk faster  I don't know why Gary would try to follow him 
[03:43:00]  If I was Gary I would just go  Okay you know what I'm talking about  Don't do it  Right  I'd follow him  It's not a very prideful move to make  Gary's looking down at his blackberry  Like someone's texting him  Oh wow  And  Oh  Nope  What happened?  Oh I can't do that one  He almost caught him  But he moved fast  Is Opie gone?  Is he out the door?  Yeah  Opie turned  And Gary turned  And now he's out?  Now he's out  Congratulations to Opie  Uh  Alright so why don't we take that break  They were talking about  And uh  And then we'll start the 
[03:43:30]  After Opie and Anthony live show  So  Stay tuned for that  I'll be here  George Washington peanut  George Washington peanut  Fuck  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over  Pretty much over  Pretty much over  This show will be available later today  With Sirius XM on demand  On demand  After Opie and Anthony show continues 
[03:44:00]  This is After Opie and Anthony live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Jim is so annoyed  I'm just fucking cranky  I know it's because I'm tired too  That's a big part of it  So now you gotta wait until the end of the hour  Yeah it's like I don't mind waiting a few minutes  I understand that's how it is  But it's like when you say to three different people  Could you just tell me  When she's coming and I'll try 
[03:44:30]  And then nobody tells you  And I'm like where is she  Oh she's in an interview  She was running late  It's like you just tell me and I'll come out  And if it can't happen it can't happen  But it's not like I'm being a baby over ten minutes  It's an extra hour  Is Sally Field worth it?  Yeah she's a legend man  Would you have been like  If you say  If you got cranky enough to skip this  And you just went home  I'd regret it  You would?  She's a legend man  She was in fucking  One of my favorite comedies of all time  Smoking a bandit?  Yeah  I love Sally Field  So when you  Don't  Like your picture obsession 
[03:45:00]  Is to the point where like  If you let one go  Or set a priority of something else  Over getting a stupid picture  Like you do have regrets about it later  Depends  Nah I mean like  One I regret  Like Kenny Rogers  Was in the building recently  And I love Kenny Rogers  But I was like  I saw him walk in  But I had to leave for something  So I didn't get him  And it was like  Eh I kind of wish I did  Because I really like him  Kenny Rogers was playing on the radio  When I was born  Yeah  Oh really?  Yeah  You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille  Oh  But I didn't get a picture with him  I don't care 
[03:45:30]  Taylor Swift was here recently  And I would get one with her  Because she's famous  But I don't regret not waiting  That's a little  That would  Well no you probably would have  Got one with Taylor Swift  Yeah of course I would  When Taylor Swift's here though  They uh  Like they get the security  And they make sure they walk him out  In a certain way  And everything  Yeah I'd get her  I got Taylor Swift  The first time she was  Well the time before  But that's only because  I did the one question with her  Um  Yeah but that's not one I would  I would just do it  Because she's a huge celebrity singer  And she's  You know  And she's kind of  You know  But that  I'm not crazy that I didn't wait 
[03:46:00]  So I don't really regret it  I bet Gary  Is so pissed at Opie right now  Did you  Yeah he probably is pissed at Opie  I mean he should be  Honestly  He should be  Were you  Were you uh  Watching Gary and Opie  Walk down the hall  Yeah  Oh I'm sorry  What was happening  Oh I don't know  So from what I'm told  Like Opie  Really did blow past  In the entire way  And went into the  Elevator lobby  He had like um  A person at half length  In front of him  Was getting  And then he slowed down  Then went faster 
[03:46:30]  Could you see if Gary  Was trying to talk to him  Or  It's just like the motions  You could see  Like hey  Well then why  This is where Gary's at fault  Gary should handle it  And say look  I would love to talk to you  About this right after the show  For two minutes  If he says no  Okay  That's it  I'm talking to you  The one point  The point that Gary had  Was it was like look  If you want things to get fixed  You gotta have a conversation about it  Yeah  Opie in his self-awareness  Just texted me  And said the beauty  Of what just happened  I wasted 20 minutes  Trying to avoid  A five minute meeting  If you just go outside 
[03:47:00]  And you drink the poison  Yeah  It'll be over  And he might have  A reasonable explanation  Plus  He might not  I mean  Gary was probably  You  Does Gary get bothered  When he gets talked about  On the air negatively  Everybody in management does  They do  I mean  We do too  I guess  The history of management  And already  I know we'll actually  We talked about  Eric you probably  Have more interactions  Than we do  Does Gary and Rob  Cross and them  Do they get annoyed  When they're talked about  On the air negatively  I think more one 
[03:47:30]  Than the other  Yes  I think Gary gets annoyed  Gary probably takes it worse  Like  Rob laughs it off  Yeah because with Rob  It's more of a  He was an on air guy  What was his on air name  Chuck Roast  What do you think  It's fucking terrible  It's a terrible on air name  Chuck Roast  Chuck Roast  Do you think anybody  Listening was like  Oh my god  I can't believe  This guy's parents  Named him Chuck Roast  Let's get home  Yeah I would love to  Okay hang on  Here you go  Hook up the  Zircom wireless LAN module 
[03:48:00]  To your palm handheld  You'll have high speed access  To network resources  From anywhere on campus  And wherever you go  You're connected  It's like  Move it along grandma  You're writing out of state  Checks for breath mints  At Rubio's Baja Grill  We've got lobster burritos  I mean you can't fault him  For the bad writing I guess  No but I can for his soft  Meek voice  Listen Jim  Yeah  What you need to know is  If you want five dollars  Off of bread steaks  Chuck Roast  Is where you need to go  I've never heard anybody  Sell something  In such a meek way 
[03:48:30]  Yeah  It's like he's selling  Selling humility  It is literally  The voice that you hear  That accused you  To change the channel  Yeah  Like whatever's going on  On this radio  I don't need to pay  Any attention to  But yeah  I think he does  Laugh it off a little more  You've seen Gary  Gets annoyed Eric  Yeah Gary doesn't like  To be confronted  Or address things  On the air  No I mean  He gets slaughtered  On the air too  Way worse than Rob  Yeah  Well we don't usually  Go around him  When that happens  Jim come here  Can you come around 
[03:49:00]  What  Look at the monitor  Do little motions  With your hands  Like you were doing  A minute ago  You see  You see the pit stain  Yeah so what  Iraq has a massive pit stain  We're wearing a hoodie  All day  On his navy blue  What did you say wrong  Ross will go in eight minutes  Oh okay  I know  It's just  A pit stain on navy  Is not  Do you sweat a lot 
[03:49:30]  Um  Is it hot  Just say yes  Is it hot in there  No it's not that hot  I sweat a lot  I'm just always overheated  I sweat a lot  Then why do you wear  A hoodie all day  I don't know  I'll just do  Just cause it looks cool  Nah it's just comfortable  Did you ever think about  Patting your underarms  With napkins  Before you come in  Yeah  I don't think it's gonna help  Or tampons  Or do you  What do you think about that  Sliding a tampon under there  That might work  It does  It does Roland  You've actually done that  No celebrities use it for  Um  Wow  What was that  Oh that's a real 
[03:50:00]  Housewives check  Oh my god  I love her to fucking  Sit on my face  Yeah  Big fucking tall man height  Yeah but she did  She had a flying ass  She did  I know um  For um  The Oscars  They put the  The absorbent tampons  When they wave  There's no pit stains  On all pictures  The men do you mean  Yeah  Cause the women can't do that  Cause they're wearing dresses  Why don't you do that Eric  Why don't you start wearing tampons  I'll have to try doing that  And how do they apply them  It's they cut in  Well the designers  They cut in  They put in their armpits  So it's like  Like um  Like a tampon 
[03:50:30]  Or a maxi pad  Like a maxi pad  Like a door bin one  Oh a pad  A pad I mean  Oh okay  Under the armpit  Or in the shirt  Uh well it's like  They put it under the armpit  So when they put the shirt on  They wave  There's nothing else  How do they affix it  To the armpit  I don't know  I bet Kevin does it  For all the Oscars  And all that  Eric  Tape it around the outside  Yeah  Would you wear maxi pads  In your underarms  It works for celebrities  Why not  Well I have to tell you  I mean that is not  A professional look you have  You really do have  An unsightly pit stain  Yeah  Okay  I mean and it's like  And this affects me  How  It affects us  Because we can't do 
[03:51:00]  The radio show  Knowing you're in there  Just sweating  Yeah  I mean there's just  A puddle forming  Under your feet  It's electrical equipment  In there  It's not safe  Should  Cherokee military  To fix that  No  Yeah  Could you do something  About his pit stain  Yeah  By the way  I have a new advice show  Starting  I haven't plugged it once  On Wednesdays  We don't know  What Wednesday it's going to start  And it's going to be  In this time slot  After  But it'll be like  After Thanksgiving right  Yeah  So my apologies to Sam  It wasn't that we didn't  Want you to have five days 
[03:51:30]  It was just  There's no other time  For me to tape it  With a live audience  So I'm not coming back  Well I mean if you  If you throw this much  Of a fit over Sally  Having to wait  25 minutes for Sally Field  I can only imagine  I'm just tired  I know I'm kind of  Being a bitch  I'm just really sleepy  And if I was sleeping better  I would handle things  A little bit better  But I'm just not  And I'm all  And like I'm on such  A schedule now  Like after the show  I like to go right to the gym  And make myself fucking do it  And I've been going every day  What kind of advice  Are you going to give to people  Helpful life advice  Since when do you give life advice  I'm an excellent advice giver  I've never known you 
[03:52:00]  To be any  Like has anybody ever said  I would like to get advice  From Jim Norton  Who hasn't said that  At one point  I've given counsel  I don't know if I've ever said  You haven't  But look at how terrible  Your life is  Maybe that's a problem  If you asked for counsel  I would give you counsel  You would  And anything you need  Roland is there any advice  I would like a preview  Is there any sort of advice  That you need from Jim Norton  You're a man whose life  Is in shambles most of the time  Yeah I enjoy it  You enjoy it  What do you think  Is your main thing  That you need some help with  You don't need to have the answers  Jim is the one  I have the answers  That's what I'm here for 
[03:52:30]  I don't know  I guess I don't  Time management  In my personal life well  Like I do work life  But not personal life well  Use your eye calendar  Write down the things  You need to do  Make a list  It's terrible advice  It's great advice  He just said  I'm good with  You know  My professional life  But not good with  My personal life  So you make a list  Of time management  Of things you need to do  Hey  Call Betty  Call Betty  7 o'clock  Make a to-do list  Put it up on the fridge  Is that what's gonna help you  Roland  A to-do list  Is gonna help you  With your social life 
[03:53:00]  Better time management  Sure  Section your time off  Say I'm going to allow myself  Nine minutes  To converse with Betty  Okay Eric  You need advice obviously  I do  We already solved  The sweating problem today  Well yeah we did  I guess  Now what's  What do you need help with  Jim is here  We're doing a little preview  Because starting Wednesday  Go to the gym  Eat less  That was the question  But there you go  Starting Wednesdays  I think after Thanksgiving  Probably  That's right  Get a calculator  Count your calories  What do you need  What do you need help with there 
[03:53:30]  I was gonna ask Jim  Jim always chimes in  Through the show  With all his dietary advice  That's right  As far as new things  That he discovers  And things that he likes to eat  So what would you recommend  As far as a new diet  For myself  Well I would just suggest  Cutting the bread and carbs  That's what's worked for me  And the little snacks  Like the pretzels  And the things you know  You shouldn't be eating  Right  Lots of grilled chicken  With no butter  Whenever I go out  And order meat  No butter please  I always say to the man  And steamed vegetables  Don't saute them  Have them steamed 
[03:54:00]  This is the most mundane  Vanilla advice I've ever heard  Excellent advice  Terrible advice  You know god damn well  Excellent advice  You know Eric  That's right  You know he's not gonna  Give up snacks  That's right  You know there is no way  He's gonna order chicken  Without butter  Put little post-it notes  On your fridge  I've never heard of chicken  With butter  Chicken with wine sauce though  That's awesome  Wine sauce might be good  Add a little butter  There's butter in it  Oh it's delicious  There's a little butter sauce  You don't want to do that  So make yourself  Little post-it notes  On the mirror  Until you can do it  Everything is writing 
[03:54:30]  Things down  Yeah  That's all the advice  Jot them  I like to say  Jot them down  Because it's a casual thing  Is Sal in there  Yeah Sal's in here  Okay Sal is a young guy  I wanna know  What advice might he want  Alright let me give him  Some advice  Never try to make  Production again  I don't know  What he's gonna ask me  Well while he comes in  How would you advise Sam  On dealing with his cat's  Bathroom issues  My cat's  He doesn't wipe his asshole  He doesn't clean it  I've been using a wet nap  To help him clean  His crusty shit asshole  Bruiser Brody the cat  We're talking about  Is there any  Is there anything 
[03:55:00]  I could be doing more  To maybe help him  Condition his own  Hygiene  Yes  It's the Pavlov's dog  Type of thing  What you're going to  Want to do  Is you're going to  Want that cat  To associate  Having a dirty ass  With an unpleasant  Experience  So what I would do  Instead of just  Wiping his ass  And sending him  On his way  I would  Whenever he has  A dirty ass  I would lift his tail  And I would  Heat up a fork  On the stove  And I would  Touch his testicles  And then wipe  His hiney  And he'll get the message  I don't want  My hiney  Wiped  Because that means  My testicles 
[03:55:30]  Are gonna be  Touched with the hot fork  Right  So I better start  Cleaning his ass  I better start  Because licking up shit  Is way better  Than catching a hot fork  Especially a hot  Tuning fork  On the scrotum  Yeah  Now Sal  You're a kid  Who's fresh out of college  Fresh out of college  Trying to make your way  In the world  Come to terms with it  You'll tell your parents  They'll understand  They'll love you anyway  Tell them  I didn't choose  To be this way  I was born this way  Play the Lady Gaga song  For him if need be  But you're a guy  Who's under  A lot of criticism  Yeah 
[03:56:00]  It seems like you've been  Making a lot of mistakes  Since you got your first job  You need to be  Comfortable with yourself  Comfortable  What type of advice  What type of advice  Would you ask  The Jim Norton Advice Hour  Well um  Well I want to experience  Something new recently  And I wanted to go  Get the Lady Gaga  Just walk up to somebody  With breasts  And say what is that  Thing between your legs  I'd like to kiss it  So the genitals  Are internal  Huh  No Sal wants to  Experience something new  So make some production 
[03:56:30]  That's good  Well what's your  What's your question  Well no I want to  I want to go to like  A place where you can get  You know like a happy ending  But I can't like  Overcome the fear  Of going there  I don't know what it is  I want to  See how you  You know your  Your experience in that  Well I find that  The only way to get over something  Is to face that fear  Dive in head first  Dive in  Head first as it were  And just go to one  There's no other way to do it  Just say to yourself  Shut down  I'm going to go  To this place  I'm going to do something  Today that I'm afraid of 
[03:57:00]  Just write it down  And then go to that place  And then afterwards say  I told myself I was going to do it  And I did it  So the name of this show  Is actually going to be  Jot it down  Advice with Jimbo  We don't have a name yet  Possibly some  What do you think about  Jot it down  Advice with Jimbo  No I think it should be  Something that implies  That I'm saving your life  This is going to be  Really good advice  You think so  Oh cool  Here's advice called  Get a picture with Sally Field  Fat tits  Well enjoy your photo Jim  Let's hope so  Watch it tell me now  Do you think you got  A good answer there Sal 
[03:57:30]  Yeah that's  It's kind of like  He's going with like  The just do it  Sort of answer  It's a terrible answer  Yeah  Like literally  Anybody could just tell you  Like I mean you could  The problem is  You're afraid to do it  So he said  We'll just do it  He said schedule it  Which I'd have to do anyway  Oh yeah  Then he said jot it down  Yeah  I forgot about that  I forgot about the  Jot it down part  Eric are you going to  Start counting your calories now  I think I should  Are you speaking of  Jotting things down  Are you prepared  For this Saturday night  When Bagelin with the Sex  Premieres 
[03:58:00]  I mean you talk about  New shows  This  Bagelin with the Sex  Is the show  That's got every person  Who's got a SiriusXM  Subscription  Saying to their friends  What's this Bagelin with the Sex  All about  I keep hearing this new show  Bagelin with the Sex  Is getting ready to premiere  In a one time only  Sort of celebratory show  What is this all about  Are you ready  I'm ready  And based on the  A lot of the screams  That I got around 6pm  This past Saturday  Screaming why I didn't  Do the show  I think everybody else  Is waiting for this show 
[03:58:30]  To happen as well  Listen  A lot of people  Are excited to hear this show  A lot of people  Want it to happen  And I got a couple tweets too  People don't realize  A week from Saturday  Means a week from Saturday  It's this coming Saturday  I guess that's the Saturday  Before Thanksgiving  We'll be Bagelin with the Sex  Now Roland I guess  Is doing the food court  Although based on today's show  Maybe a movie review show  Would be even better  But I guess he's doing  The food court  Where he reviews  Different dining establishments  What are you doing 
[03:59:00]  On Bagelin with the Sex  Is it a sex show  No it's not a sex show  It's just a sex show  In the sense that  The Sex Bagel is hosting  Yeah that's what you called it  Right  Bagelin with the Sex  So it's just me  Doing an hour of a show  Not dealing with sex  That's too bad  I was hoping to get  Some insight  On the sex cock  As I call it  No sorry  So what are we doing  On the show  What are we focused  What's our focus  A couple of things  One I have a friend of mine  Who writes for a magazine 
[03:59:30]  He does video game reviews  And such  We're going to talk about  Stuff coming out  For the holiday season  He's going to have  Some giveaways as well  I'm going to talk to  A couple people involved  With the aftermath  Of Hurricane Sandy  Since that affected  My family pretty much  I'm going to have them  In there  And maybe one or two  Other things  This doesn't sound like  A very fun show at all  Well tough shit  Do your own show  This one's mine  Where's the fun though  Why is everything  Got to be fun  Because why would people  Listen  We cancelled Big Kev's 
[04:00:00]  Geek stuff  Why are you doing that  This isn't geek stuff  It sounds like  Big Kev's geek stuff  Mixed with  Hurricane Katrina coverage  Or Hurricane Sandy  That's not too topical  For him  Well Hurricane Sandy  Happened three weeks ago  No you said Katrina  That's what I mean  Sandy's not that  Topical either  But don't you think  The Sandy stuff  Will be a downer  I think it'll be  Interesting as far as  What is actually going on  You only got an hour  Yeah I know  That's what I want to do  Alright  And I have a surprise  To go with it too  You do  Yeah  A fun surprise 
[04:00:30]  I think for some  Out there yes  Okay okay okay  We gotta make sure  The fun is there  Because people associate  Sex with fun  And you are sex  And unrelated to  The surprise  What's going on back there  I don't know  Troy just walked in  Talking to the intern  I heard someone say  Wow cool  I'm looking for clips  I'm not telling him  What to pull  Oh okay  Because I was going to say  If there was something  Cool going on  I would like to know  What it is  No I'm looking for  Specific clips  That Anthony needs  To find for me  So you want them  Saying wow cool 
[04:01:00]  Like I need  Reaction stuff  Okay because if you  Had come in there  And were like wow cool  And not told me  What you were saying  That about  I would have felt  Very left out  You understand  Or about Eric's show  Well it don't matter  What the cool thing was  I would like to know  In general  Right  But there wasn't  One this time  No I just need  Audio reactions  You're excited  About Eric's show  I think Roland and I  Are going to put together  A really good show  So  Oh I forgot  You're Roland's  Executive producer  Oh I totally forgot  About that part 
[04:01:30]  Yeah  Okay so you're excited  About Roland's show  Of course  That's going to be  A fun show  Yes it is  Do you have  Hurricane Sandy victims  On for Roland's show  Yeah  No  Alright well Eric's  One up to you there  Sal have you worked  With Eric on this at all  We had a brief meeting  Last week  What do you think  Of your choice Eric  As Sal as your  Executive producer  I think he'll be  Just fine  Why do you say that  Because he's just  Going to run the board  You could have had  A board op and an EP  An EP is supposed  To creatively be  On the same page with you  Well some stuff 
[04:02:00]  Happened this week  And I haven't had a  Chance to talk to Sal yet  So we're going to  Have a meeting  And put some more  Stuff together  Are you optimistic Sal  Yeah  Did I not have  A good like  Overall game plan  Yeah you did  What was your game plan  Well I had like  A good layout  Of like  You don't have to  Give away too much  Yeah just things  That like  I was trying to  Appease the talent  I was trying to say  If there's anything  You need me to do  I will go for it  You know  I had a few  Things that we could  Discuss or elaborate  On during the show  What kind of things  Were you thinking  Well was there  Anything  That Eric rejected  Yeah I said 
[04:02:30]  If there was like  A bit he wanted  To maybe put together  Or just something  But he didn't want  To do that  You don't want to  Do any bits Eric  No  Interesting  Well you only got  An hour right  Yeah  So you got to  Make your choices  Are you going to  Do bits Troy  No no bits  No bullshit  No right  You're not about  The steak without  You're not about  Just the sizzle  It's going to be  A tiny little bit  Of sizzle  But a heaping  Helping of steak  Right  I understand  I understand  Yeah  Now are you  Looking at this  Because what we're  Doing is this  Saturday on this  Channel  5pm eastern 
[04:03:00]  Is going to be  Roland's food court  Followed at 6pm eastern  By bageling with the sex  Sal is the EP  Of bageling with the sex  Which I don't know  Honestly Sal  Yeah  Do you not think  That it was the worst  Decision Eric could have  Made  It wasn't the worst  But he could have  Done better  Based on his choices  Who could have been worse  Who could have been worse  I don't know  Maybe the intern  Or Roland  After I made that decision  I've been getting  A text from somebody  Who's begging me  To fire Sal  And hire him on  As my EP  That would be Pat Duffy 
[04:03:30]  But you can't fire  You can't  And you can't hire  Pat Duffy  I know  He wasn't one of the choices  Nope  Plus Pat Duffy  Would just have you  Like oh you could  Cut your balls open  With a pair of scissors  Go for it  And you'd be like  What I'm trying to do  No I'm trying to  Talk to some  Hurricane Sandy people  And see the problem  With that is  Pat Duffy's going to  Make this show too fun  You don't like  A lot of fun  Well no I mean  It's going to be like  Oh it's going to be  Crazy  It's going to be like  I have to tune in  And hear how great this is  And that's not  What it's going to be like  I mean  Not based on what  You've heard with the 
[04:04:00]  What do you think  I mean I don't know  I think  The Hurricane Sandy stuff  Is a risk  You got one hour  It's not like you're on  Once a week  You have one hour  And that's it  This is like the pilot show  And I think  And other than like  People that got hit  With Hurricane Sandy  And it was even like  What two weeks ago  It'll be three weeks  By the time the show airs  What does the rest of the country  Give a shit about Hurricane Sandy  I mean Troy brings up  A good point  It is a national show  It is a national show  But people gave a shit  About what happened  With Katrina  Well after two weeks 
[04:04:30]  Yeah but Katrina  Was a shit load worse  Than Sandy  I say  All I'm saying  Is it's a risk Eric  It's a big risk  I wouldn't do it personally  It's not the whole show  It's just  It's a small portion  How much  How big is your Sandy segment  And that's what we'll call it  The Sandy segment  On sexing with the bagel  I don't know yet  You'll have to listen  Oh  I like it  That's fishing me in  I mean it's not really  Just to find out  How long this is  Seriously like  What's your prediction  Of how this show  Is going to go  Eric's show  Yeah  You want to know 
[04:05:00]  I'm going to tell you  But I'm going to give Eric  A tip when I tell you  Because I know  How Eric can make the show  Work in his favor  Right  Not to format the thing  If Eric comes in here  Because people like Eric  Because he's an underdog  If Eric comes in here  And he's just like  Playing his  E-Rock Army  Production  And just doing weird shit  And just kind of  Shooting the shit  And being the  I don't give a fuck guy  And then taking a lot  Of phone calls  From people being like  You're the fucking shit  You're my nagel  And doing  You know what I mean  And coming up with 
[04:05:30]  Catchphrases like that  If he did that  Then it would sound good  That's what he needs to do  Yeah  Is he going to do that though  I am worried  That he's going to  Overformat it  And he's going to have  Stuff like  Like the Hurricane Sandy  Stuff  And I don't know  Like talking to a guy  Who reviews video games  Like why would you  Talk to a guy  Who you could just  Review a video game  You got a radio show  Right  Like why talk to  Why interview a reviewer  Well maybe because  He can't get to  All the new video games  Yeah he can  Eric  Eric can get all 
[04:06:00]  The new video games  But then he brings  Somebody else in  So then he can  Bounce stuff off of them  About video games  Yeah you can be like  It's the Eric show though  People are tuning in  For bageling with the sex  Yeah but you have to  Have characters on the show  I get that  You have to have  Other people involved  You can have experts on  It gets a little boring  If it's just you  Just talking the whole time  Yeah but you don't  Want talking  Like you don't want  This isn't MSNBC  Like you don't want  Experts on  You want like fun people  Maybe this guy's fun  He reviews video games  Troy  He's a video game reviewer 
[04:06:30]  I mean he needs  To know how to talk  Right  Is he a print journalist  Yeah he's a print journalist  No  Is the answer  He doesn't need to know  How to talk  No  Is he a fun guy  Yeah  He is fun  Have you hung out with him  Have you gone to dinner with him  I haven't gone to dinner with him  No  Did you fuck his wife  No  Alright  I just had to get that on the table  Before we got  Um  But he does  He has fun  Oh yeah  You talk to him about stuff  Other than video games  A couple other things  Yeah  Like cause  He also used to be 
[04:07:00]  A music journalist  Cause people are not gonna tune in  To get like  The facts on something  They don't want the facts  On Hurricane  Well the Hurricane Sandy  There might be at least  Some personal stories there  Maybe  But like the video game stuff  They don't want facts  On a video game  They don't  They're not tuning in  To sexing with the B  I'm gonna  Yeah  I'm gonna advise Eric  To be more of a positive  Fun show I think  Just advise Eric  To listen to me  Well you know  You have some good points  I won't deny that  But I think it's better  If you only got an hour  Let's not make it a doubt  It's gotta be like 
[04:07:30]  Really happy and  Interesting  Just fucking chill  Hanging out  Was there an option  To have you as the producer  Yeah  And he bounced on you  Yes  Yes  The one guy here  Who  Let me ask you something  Who on this channel  Besides OB Anthony  Jim Norton  Has put together  More shows than me  Nobody  Nobody  All I do all day  Is put together shows  And then I  And then I  Perform on them  On top of putting them together 
[04:08:00]  I could've killed this thing  Who would've been better  Other than you  Nobody  I was the best pick  That's obvious  Okay that's fine  But then who would be  Second in line  To you  Um  I feel like  You were already picked  Danny's probably  The second most  Creative  And then Travis  And then Sal  Sal was definitely  Last place  So what was your  Reasoning for picking Sal  What was your reasoning  For picking Sal  Eric  Because  I could tell Sal 
[04:08:30]  What I wanted  And I didn't need  Anybody else  Trying to control this thing  Like you guys  Would've done  Yeah but don't you think  That like having  The ideas of somebody else  Would've been good  Um  Yes  But I also felt  At that point  That this was a stacked deck  That even if I picked  Somebody else  It was going to be  Somebody else was going  To try to  Force me to do things  Or change things  That I was going to do  I'm going to tell you  Something  That makes sense  Yeah but you know what  If I was executive producer  Of the Eric show  There's no fucking way 
[04:09:00]  That Troy and Roland  Could put their heads together  And put together  A better show  That's no offense to you  No  But it wouldn't happen  Right  You know that  It'd be like  If I was like  Okay let's also  Produce our own intros  Your intro  Would kill ours  But the content  Of the show  Would be like  But  Eric picked Sal  So he's going to talk  About Hurricane Sandy  For a while  Yeah  We all make choices  Plus  I know how an hour  Feels on the air  I know how to  Whatever  And if it doesn't go well  I mean that's a long  Ass hour  Yeah  It could go quick 
[04:09:30]  It could go very long  Right  You never know  I'm optimistic  I think you're overanalyzing  All of this  This is your big break  Eric  This is Bageling with the Sex  The most talked about  Radio show in the history  Of the channel  And that includes  The show that the channel  Is named after  Most anticipated  Everybody's amped  I know  Listen  We gotta make room  For Ron and Fez  That's another great show  Besides Bageling with the Sex  So tune in for that  It's coming up next  And we'll be back  With more of this  And the Jim Norton  Sally Field Report
