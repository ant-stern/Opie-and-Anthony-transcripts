<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a contentious segment featuring listener Ryan's scathing critique of Rich Voss's stand-up performance.  Ryan launched into a tirade of personal insults against Voss, detailing specific jokes that offended her.  Other callers joined the fray, some defending Voss's "crowd work," while others sided with Ryan. The segment devolved into a chaotic exchange of insults and accusations. One caller, Phil, even labelled Voss and his wife "awful human beings," despite finding their act humorous.

The show then transitioned to Robert Kelly recounting his abusive childhood, detailing physical abuse and witnessing domestic violence at the hands of his stepfather.  He described the stark contrast between a period of lavish gifts and a subsequent descent into violence.  The hosts interspersed their comments and jokes throughout his harrowing narrative.  This was followed by a series of listener calls sharing their own experiences with running away from home as children, often recounting humorous, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, escape attempts.  Many cited parental discipline as the catalyst.  This included a caller's story of a Hollywood encounter leading to an Arizona mental institution.  Bob Kelly made a brief promotional appearance during this segment.

The focus abruptly shifted to the upcoming presidential election, specifically Barack Obama's candidacy.  D.L. Hughley joined the show in studio, and a heated debate ensued about racial politics and the potential implications of a Black president.  The conversation tackled social programs, taxes, and the complexities of race in America.  The hosts and Hughley expressed differing viewpoints, with some advocating for supporting Obama primarily due to his race, while others emphasized evaluating his political platform.  Several callers contributed their opinions, and the discussion was punctuated by racial slurs and offensive language.  The segment concluded with further analysis of Obama's symbolic candidacy and the varied perspectives within the Black community, incorporating – albeit questioned – statistics on US racial demographics.

A subsequent segment delved into a discussion about healthcare, sparked by Senator Ted Kennedy's death.  Patrice O'Neal engaged in a heated debate with the hosts regarding socialized medicine versus the American system, touching upon wealth disparity and perceived entitlement.  The conversation expanded to encompass religion's role in American society, historical exploitation of various groups (including Black, Italian, and Mexican laborers), and the challenges of addressing historical injustices.  O'Neal shared personal anecdotes about his childhood on welfare and his family's struggles.  The discussion was frequently punctuated with profanity and inflammatory language.  A live audience poll revealed a strong preference for Obama over McCain (roughly 2:1).  The conversation continued to focus on the election, touching upon Obama's voting record, McCain's age and health, and the influence of "white guilt" on voting patterns.  D.L. Hughley and Andrew Dice Clay made appearances during this segment, with Clay appearing briefly at the end.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a heated phone call with Andrew Dice Clay and Jay Moore.  The argument stemmed from Moore's alleged use of Clay's catchphrase "yambeg" on Conan O'Brien, escalating into accusations of line-stealing, unprofessional conduct, inappropriate behavior towards women, threats, and snubbing invitations.  Moore's wife, Nicole, added to the conflict.  A recording of Moore's Conan appearance was played. The argument involved details about a comedy show at Westbury Music Fair and Moore's birthday party, which Clay did not attend. This was followed by another heated exchange between Jay Moore and Dice, stemming from comments Dice made about Jay, including accusations of hitting on women and a perceived threat. Nicole Moore called in, expressing concern, but the conversation devolved into threats of violence and insults toward Jay's wife and mother. Ralphie May, a friend of both comedians, called in to corroborate aspects of Nicole Moore's account.  Greg Proops was also in studio and participated in a separate discussion with the hosts about topics ranging from the Olympics to office lottery pools and the Dubai Ports deal.

The show continued with a segment heavily focused on Dick Cheney's hunting accident, where he shot a lawyer in the face.  The hosts and callers made numerous jokes and cynical comments about the incident and the media coverage.  Jay Moore promoted his work and website, geneticdisaster.com.  Greg Proops, present for a considerable time, later left.  A significant portion focused on callers sharing graphic details about masturbating with friends during adolescence, leading to humorous speculation about homoeroticism.

The final segment featured bizarre and shocking anecdotes, including a man's unusual sexual experiences involving food, one host's guilt over playing online chess against children, and caller Darren's account of using power tools for self-stimulation. Rich Voss promoted his website and MySpace page.  The show concluded with a promotional announcement featuring Patrice O'Neal, Bill Burr, Louis C.K., Robert Kelly, Colin Quinn, and Voss, interspersed with crude humor and vulgar jokes. Voss also mentioned his use of Metamucil.  Throughout the broadcast, offensive language, including racial slurs and other derogatory terms, was used frequently.

[00:36:00]  See through it  You know  And the little lights  Lit up when the  Spark plugs  Happened  And I happened to  Put the crankshaft  In backwards  So I'm like  The pistons  Wouldn't line up  And then I realized  I had to start  Taking shit apart  And he comes  And he goes  What happened  I go  Oh I think  I put the crankshaft  In backwards  And he goes  Everything you do  You fuck up  Jesus  Everything you do  You just fuck it up  I'm just sitting there  Like  Just fuck the model  It's a model  But everything  Was like that

[00:37:00]  With pencils  And paper  And stuff  And I would draw things  Usually I would try  To draw naked chicks  You know  You gotta kinda  Have talent for that  So I'm just drawing  And he'd come by  And look and go  That just  That sucks  Jesus  That sucks  I love this guy  Oh  Oh he was the worst  Dennis  Dennis was his name  Oh fuck yourself  I used to figure  Mine would make me  Go outside  And do yard work  And I'd pretend  Like a weed whacker  Like I wouldn't do it right  And he'd come out  And go  You gotta do it this way 
[00:37:30]  And then he'd do it  A little bit  Give it back  And then he'd fuck it up again  And he'd go  Just get the fuck out of here  You idiot  And he'd just  Mind up doing it  It was stupid  He was like good  I didn't wanna do it  You fucking idiot  Who's the idiot now  That was a douche  Oh I should've stabbed him  Hey we got  Some phone calls coming in  This is  This is the  The mind of like  A seven year old  Here we go  John in Texas  Go ahead  Tell your story  Yeah man  I don't know  I don't know what it was  But I got fed up  Had enough  And I grabbed  You know  The old big brown paper sack  You get the burpees for 
[00:38:00]  And I popped it full  Of what I could get  Out of my drawers  Started out the house  And you know  Without any hesitation  I got probably  As far as the mailbox  And the bag  Just got too fucking heavy  I came back  Oh that's good  And my mom and dad  My aunt and uncle  Are sitting inside the house  Laughing  And they'd lock the fucking door  And wouldn't let me back in  Jesus  That's what I wanna hear  Cause everyone has the great idea  Of I'm gonna run away  And then what  What caused you to turn around  And go  Oh fuck 
[00:38:30]  I'm stuck until I'm 14, 15  Fucking Clarice Starling  Was better at running away  Than you  She carried a lamb  I know  You grabbed two hams  And a butt cake  Let's go to Cross Critter  Cross Critter  Hey boys  I was about  I was living over in Japan  We were in the Air Force  And everything  And me and my sister  I was in the first grade  We took off  Even grabbed my  You know  Goofy ass little stuffed animal  Went down to the  The park there

[00:39:30]  So I just ran around the block  Hoping a bridge was built  We got Doug in Los Angeles  Doug  Hey how's it going guys  Hey  Okay  When I was  It was either 7 or 8  My mom caught me playing doctor  With this girl down the street  So  She grounds me  And  I was so upset at this  That I ended up  I decided to run away  I threw a bunch of toys  Into a pillowcase  And I opened my window  And I was gonna 
[00:40:00]  Run away  Just going out through the window  But I couldn't bring myself  To do it  So I'm sitting there  On the windowsill  For about 45 minutes  Until she finally  You know poked her head  Into my bedroom  To see what I was doing  Cause I just had to sit there  Until the last second  When she was gonna  You open the door  And then I was gonna  Jump out the window  I wish  I wish that happened  On the 20th floor  I know what he's saying  I think these parents  Were right  I know what he's saying  Though  I did that  You don't wanna  Kill you  I tried to fake suicide 
[00:40:30]  I hung out a window  For around an hour  And they never came up  I was like  And I'm crying  And then I'm waiting  For them to try  To knock on the door  And get in  I put the bureau  Up against the door  But so they could get in  So they wanted to break  And what are you doing  And then I was gonna  Pretend to jump  And they finally did come up  But the bureau  Opened too quick  So they just went there  And they're like  What are you doing dummy  I think my father went  It's a second floor window  What are you gonna  Break an elbow  You're not gonna 
[00:41:00]  Kill yourself  Well no  This is the first floor  I wanted them to see me  As I was leaving  But I couldn't commit  To the running away  Oh alright  You wanted them to stop you  And rescue you  Yeah  Let's go to David and Dallas  A couple more of these  David  Yeah  I got as far as  A neighbor's garage  Alright hold on  What?  I ran away  I was about 8 years old  I got as far as  A neighbor's garage  Fell asleep in there  There's 5 of us  In my family  Nobody knew  I was fucking gone  Here's the kicker 
[00:41:30]  Here's the kicker  I brought my dog  With me  It wasn't a fucking  Chihuahua  It was a god damn  Great Dane  And they didn't know  Either one of us  Were gone  Probably happy  They probably  Were calling the dog  Come here boy  They probably  They probably  The dog ate me  And left  I don't know  But you know  That's my life  As the youngest of 5  There you go  Thanks David  Two more  And then we'll move on  Mike in Kentucky  What's up?  Hey how you guys doing?  Hey  My old man was going to  Whip my ass with a belt  For about the 60th time 
[00:42:00]  And I decided that I  Wasn't going to have it anymore  So I grabbed my shotgun  Went on out in the woods  I was probably about  9 years old  I was going to go out there  And be Grizzly Adams  And survive on the land  I got out there  And sat around  It was in the fall time  For about 5-6 hours  It started getting dark  And I got scared  I remember my old man  Yelling at me  When I was in the woods  You gotta come back to eat  You little thump bitch  So  I was getting hungry 
[00:42:30]  And he was right  I went on back to the house  And they fed me  And then he put me  In the bedroom there  And he got the belt out  Whip my ass with the belt anyway  It was probably harder  Than he was going to  Wow  That's good  So you are going to run away  Belting on the ass  And then it got dark  And you had to turn around  I got dark  It got dark  I got hungry  And he was right  And I probably got it worse  Than I would have  If I just would have hung around  But that was my lesson  See I knew it  Most of these end with  You gotta go back home  But this guy  I wonder if this is true 
[00:43:00]  Richie in Connecticut  Tell your story  Hey what's going on  Hey  I was 12 years old  1986  I ran away to Washington  The state of Washington  I was from Long Island  My parents  Coke dealers  And I just took  $8,000  And they didn't even know  I was gone for two weeks  They thought I was  At my grandmother's house  And you really went  Cross country  At 12  I got nailed in McDonald's  The reason I went to Washington  Because like  The Goonies were from Washington  Wait wait 
[00:43:30]  Wait you gotta  Hold on sir  You got a big laugh  So we missed the next line  So the Goonies  Were from Washington  So I thought I'd go live out there  And you know  Live with the Goonies  Or something  I don't know how I was thinking  But I took  They caught me in McDonald's  Because there was a cop next to me  And I took out  Like I had like  600 bucks in cash  And he's like  Where'd you get that money  Little fella  And they wound up  Nailing me that way  Oh that sucks  Smart enough to get  Across country with 8 grand  Dumb enough to think  The Goonies are real  You missed out

[00:45:00]  And looks into the bushes  And sees me  And I look up at him  With those big eyes  And I said  Shh I'm not here  My neighbor pretended I wasn't there  And then he comes out  With the big old  You know that huge water gun  You attach to your water hoses  Yeah  Starts spraying me down  And I get all wet and muddy  And so when I come back home  I finally  Because I was getting sick  So I come back home  I walk inside  My mom's sitting there  Having a martini on the couch  She looks at me  And she just starts laughing  And I just go home

Of course it does  Because he's gonna  His top priority is gonna be  Taking care of  Poor black people  Let me ask you a question  Does the president have that much power  To just take care of  Whoever the fuck he wants to take care of  Because guilty white people  Are gonna be more apt to take care of  He's not gonna do shit for black people  He's not even  What?

[01:03:30]  You're talking about  What about  Other programs?  Thank you  And he's not gonna  Just do that  He's not gonna  Just help black people  He's not gonna do that  No you're right  He's not just gonna do that  He's gonna help everybody  He's gonna take my tax breaks  That were given to me  And take those away  By who?  Reagan?  50 years ago?  Reagan and Bush?  Daddy Bush  Not this Bush  No this Bush  Gave tax breaks  To fucking  To rich folks?  Not rich  Rich folks  People that live in New York City  That make $100,000 a year  You tell me  You ask them  If they're fucking rich  They're rich folks 
[01:04:00]  Or if they're scrimping  $100,000 a year  100 grand in New York City  Is not rich  Fucking live like  Instead of living like a  Like you got $100,000  And no one  Live like a hundredaire  Instead of living like a thousandaire  No one got this fucking  $100,000 a year job  By fucking  Going on welfare  Or fucking social programs  Nobody's even on welfare anymore  They work their balls off  No one's on welfare  Bullshit  Welfare doesn't even exist  WIC cards  Whatever the fuck you wanna call them  It's fucking food  You goddamn gruesome motherfucker  You just help  Some guy 
[01:04:30]  No one gives a fuck about  Not kill himself  Can't a nigga get a sandwich?  Good  Good  Work for the motherfucking sandwich  Fucking asshole  Work for the sandwich  Jesus Christ  Work for it  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Work  Dude  Get a fucking job for the sandwich  Some people look  Like the gas situation  Okay  Anthony  For real  Doesn't affect you  From  From $80 a gallon  To $160  I mean 
[01:05:00]  From $80 to fill up your truck  Yeah  To  $120 to fill up your truck  Yeah  Doesn't mean anything to you  Doesn't mean anything to Norton maybe  Doesn't mean anything to me  Maybe  Maybe  It's like  I can afford that  But there's motherfuckers out there  Dude  That are  Extra  $50  A day  For extra $50  To fill up your tank  It's not that they're begging  Or anything else man  You think I'm against  Low gas prices?  Where the fuck did this come from?  No not low gas prices 
[01:05:30]  But the fact that the gas prices  Aren't gonna lower  Um  Because it's a private sector  I mean  The oil doesn't owe  Us anything  That's the thing about the oil thing  It's like if you're on crack  And the motherfucker goes  You know what  Instead of  The crack dealer goes  Instead of $10  It's gonna be $20  Deal with it motherfucker  Now that's what the oil companies are doing  Why do we need breaks?  Now it's the private sector  They're fucking everybody  But as  As  People  As humans  It's like somebody  Just because they need help 
[01:06:00]  Doesn't mean they're begging for help  Means  You need some fucking help  From this  From your country  This country  This country  Will ask you to go to war  And ask you to do a lot of things  For it  It will  If you say anything wrong about it  You're not a fucking American  All this shit this country  Pressure this country  Places on you  And  It can't help a motherfucking  Get a sandwich  I got a quarterly tax bill  On my counter  Right now  That is due on the 15th  You fucking look at that thing  And tell me I'm not doing enough  I don't  Fuck yourself  I don't know what you make

[01:07:00]  I don't want to do more  And can you fucking please add  I don't want to do more  Can you please add  Poor white folks to it too  Cause you get the insinuation  That this is some old black shit  There's  White people are  In the same boat  And that's what I don't like  Is that this shit is really  Not a black and white thing  It's  Black people make a black and white thing  It's economic  Well because  They do  It's terrible  Bring them in  I don't know why  Anthony you are outnumbered today  DL Hughley  Please  I know DL feels  The same way I do  He don't want his tax money 
[01:07:30]  Going up  Jesus Christ  He'll agree with me  First of all  Cause he's black  Second of all  Man y'all about  Your own audience  Yeah  Either this  Or as a methadone clinic  What is this man  Yeah on Fridays  We kind of do the live audience thing  What's happening man  Friday's the day to come by  And check out the show live  Oh man  What's up DL  What did I miss  Just in a heated dispute  About Obama  And fucking taxes  And social programs 
[01:08:00]  And my tax money going up  For shit programs  That don't work  But you can't  You can't control  What the government's gonna do  With your fucking tax money  So  I know  It'll go where it goes  I don't want it going up  How does DL fit  I mean  Here it is  Reallocate  Where my fucking money  That I'm paying already  Goes  And I'm fine with it  But that is what's gonna happen  But he's not guaranteeing that shit  Wait wait wait  My tax shit's gonna go up  What makes you say that  Because  Because there's gonna be  There's gotta be  All kinds of social programs now 
[01:08:30]  That Obama's gonna want  To put in place  Well let me raise this  This is honest  This is an honest question  We had  Where our economy's failing  Right  Yeah  Tax revenues  I mean  Are down  And nobody's making any money  Right  So obviously  What we're doing  Hasn't worked  Yeah  So what is wrong  With trying  Because  First of all  Give a nigga a chance  What the fuck he gonna do  There's too much money  Being spent on a fucking war  Right  That's the problem  That he's trying  He's gonna get out of  No he's not gonna get out of it 
[01:09:00]  He's not gonna get out of it  He's gonna try to  Here's the thing  Good luck  I really don't believe  I believe preachers  Pimps and politicians  Are really all the same  Motherfuckers  They really are  Like anybody who makes  Their living off your  Hopes, your dreams  And your fears  Really all the same guy  And this is a job application  I can  This is the biggest job application  I don't know one motherfucker  That tells the truth  On a job application  When is the last time  You don't even tell the truth  On your driver's license  What woman out there  Really weigh 112  But I think that 
[01:09:30]  America has a tendency  To pick symbols  They go  This is  Like to me  I worry that he's a symbol  Like people go  Look how far we've come  We elected  He is a symbol though  We ain't gonna change shit else  It's like Kmart  We changed the shine  But not the shit in it  That's who  That's why I just won  The black president  That's why all that  Other horse shit  That you know  Trying to find the  The  The  The  The  Like in  Pencils  See this thing  White people always gotta  Find a reason  To not be racist  Like you gotta find 
[01:10:00]  A reason  To just go  I ain't phone for this nigga  It's gotta be  Some reason  He can't bowl  But for them  It was like  The nigga couldn't bowl  I don't trust a nigga  That can't bowl  In Pennsylvania  And West Virginia  It's funny  Because in West Virginia  Let me tell you  First off a black dude  With a cardboard sign  Asking for change  In West Virginia  They're like  Is he panhandling  I don't even know  What he's doing  But in West Virginia  And Ohio  And West Virginia  Ohio  The Dakotas  Even in Puerto Rico 
[01:10:30]  You gotta consider  She was winning primaries  By large numbers  Even when they knew  She couldn't win  19% of Americans say  I wouldn't vote for him  No matter what  That's the 19% of Americans  That'll come out and say it  So how many people  How many  How many  Here's the question  How many  Out of the 300 million  White people  You figure how many  It's not 300 million  There's 300 million  White people in this country  No  Yeah  300 million people  No  300 million  God damn  White people  Get the fuck out of here 
[01:11:00]  Go look at the fucking thing  I'm not gonna just  That's the whole population  Wait a minute  No it's not  You're saying a number  And I'm saying a number  And I'm wrong  Fuck that  Maybe 200 something  I don't think it's 200  Now let's just say  How many out of  Out of  How many of those  People  Do Obama need  How many white people  Do Obama need  To fucking win the presidency  Fuck the racist ones  That ain't gonna vote for them  Or anyway  But the guilty  The white people  That have white guilt  And the actual  Decent white people 
[01:11:30]  Who go  Alright fuck that  You're gonna get  I don't know  You're gonna get  This is a great conversation  I hate to admit  He's gonna get  The democratic vote  Not necessarily  What you think  It's no racist democrats  What  Oh there are racist democrats  That won't say  Fuck that  When they go into  Curve  Connecting with the  Blue collar  Rural democrats  For some reason  Whenever people  Grow shit  They don't like black people  Like  And farmers  And black people  Farmers used to love us  I don't know  I don't know  How we drifted apart  This is great 
[01:12:00]  Cause we giving away  All my tomatoes  To WIC programs  You fucking asshole  God damn niggas  Getting my corn for free  It's awful  But I think people  Are getting  Like to me  The  The  Like politicians  I don't even know  Why you want to be  Like you guys  Lost the governor  Just cause he hired  A hooker  And I didn't even  And he wrote a check  For a hooker  Which I think is  Like that's pretty much  A cash and carry  Business right there  Yeah  Give me the money  Give me the ass  No credit cards  Right  And then you replaced him  With a black dude  Who's black blind 
[01:12:30]  Admitted he had  Several affairs  And did cocaine  So he's basically  Ray Charles  Like cause when you're blind  You can get away with anything  You mean that wasn't my wife  That is true  You know  I think he gets away  A little more  So I think politicians  In general  Like  It's to me  America has a problem  Like  Congress's approval rating is down  But you ask everybody  Do they love their congressman  And they do  And they said  DL let me  It sounds like you're saying  And  It sounds like you're saying  Obama  And I agree with this 
[01:13:00]  On a level  You might not be saying this  But I'm not really into  What does it sound like I'm saying  It sounds like you're saying  He ain't shit anyway  Cause he's a politician  Right  But  And I  And I agree with it  On that level  But the next level  That I'm  I just want there  On  I just want there to be  A black president  Well  Because you gotta  Because you gotta  Get it out the way  Watch what you want  It's gotta get it out the way  Okay listen  But I agree with that  Black quarterback  I agree with that  But what I'm saying is  The 
[01:13:30]  The  The transcendent  What I don't like is  Any politician  Telling  Any politician  Telling me how great  Things are gonna be  If he  Is in charge  But you know  It's not  Jackie Robinson  Wasn't even the best  Black baseball player  When he came  It's just like  What happens is  Once he's the president  Then black people  Cause black people  Really  We're just one constituency  At least white people  Can be two things  You can be  Three things  White  You can be  Democrat or Republican  Black people on this thing  We gotta be black 
[01:14:00]  You can be black  A Democrat  Or an Uncle Tom  No no no  It's pretty much  If you're a Republican  But basically  We gotta be black  On this issue  So that then  We can be  Cut in half  Because like  There's enough  Black mayors  For a black person  To not have to vote  For a mayor  Cause he's black  Right  You gotta vote  For the black president  Cause he's black  Cause you're black  Just to get this  As something that  Just like black quarterbacks  There's enough  Black quarterbacks  Where a white person  Can go  This motherfucker sucks  Without being a racist 
[01:14:30]  So you can't go  Obama sucks  But you can go  The mayor  Or Detroit sucks  Well no  Here's what you can do  I think that  Just for me  I have a pragmatic  Kind of view  I don't believe  That politicians  By nature  Are good people  I think that they  And so  And he to me  Is one of them  And he to me  Is one of them  I hate when everybody  He  I hate that everybody  He's acting like  He's not a  He's not Jesus  He is a politician 
[01:15:00]  Yes  And so I keep  Politicians  You know  I'll vote for the  DL  Come on now  You are alive  You are alive  With possibly  Fuck all the  The logistics  Of politics man  You may be alive  And if he's a  Fucked up guy  At least he's a  Black fucked up guy  We need to see  A black president  I want to see  A black president  My point is  I don't want  What I don't want  Is for anybody  To confuse the fact  Of course  I'll vote for him 
[01:15:30]  Because I believe  He's the best  Of what we have  But I don't place  Any politician  In high esteem  He's the best  Of what we have  And I think  That that is  In America  I think the problem  In America  Is that we  Don't ever hold  These people accountable  We kind of go  I'll vote for you  Because of this  I'll vote for you  Because you can make  All the promises you want  But you ain't ever  Got to keep them  Because of this  The bottom line  This country is in  The shape that it's in  Because people make  Dumb decisions  Right  And they constantly  Dumb decisions  For all dumbery  I'm not saying him  I'm talking about  As a nation  We all make  Because it's basically  A dude who's half black 
[01:16:00]  Running against a dude  Who's half dead  Let me ask you this  Let me ask you this  If you thought  If you thought  Right  And this is  As a black man  This is one of those questions  And I'm not one of these  Motherfuckers  That go oh you're  This or that  Because you  I'm just asking  If  If you thought  McCain  Was really a better  Candidate  Well I couldn't think that  I'm saying  I'm saying his politics  If you weighed  Each of their politics  Obama or McCain 
[01:16:30]  If you weighed it  And you go fuck  McCain stands for  More things  I'm being hypothetical  McCain stands for  More things  That I stand for  Would you vote McCain  If I vote  I wouldn't motherfucker  If I believe  If somebody  If I believe  I'm not gonna  You know what I'm never gonna do  I'm never gonna be somebody else  For the  I think that  For the sake of expediency  Like I think  We do too many things  Cause we get caught up  In the stream  And go  I would vote  For a guy  Who I believed in  Regardless of what  I don't believe in McCain  I don't believe in the 
[01:17:00]  Republican party  Right  So that  I'm just being hypothetical  In terms of  But it ain't no hypothetical for me  I'm gonna vote what I want  Regardless of what  I don't hold the party  Jesus is being racist  I do  You're being completely racist  I mean yes man  Okay  I just  I know it sounds great  I just want the  Look it  I don't think the motherfucker  Is gonna change nothing  I don't think it's gonna be  The black dawn of anything  Let me tell you  Whitey's point of view  On this whole thing though  Is  And it's just what I said  Black president  All bets are gonna be off  And this is Whitey's point of view  Every white guy 
[01:17:30]  Is gonna say now  There's a black fucking president  Shut the fuck up  Shut the fuck up  No shit  You gotta be out of your fucking mind  This motherfucker  This motherfucker  Got to the presidency  Of the United States  So can you  All bets are off  Right  Go fuck yourself  That's what Whitey's gonna say  Pick your bootstraps up  Look  Yes  Pick yourself up  By your bootstraps  You're gonna say  Go to school  Whatever the fuck it takes  Whatever he did  To get into that office  You can fucking do now  White people invent  You transcendent racism  You invent anything 
[01:18:00]  What  To make it comfortable  For white folks  This is my thing  I don't want  I don't want to hear  Black  This is what I'm saying  About black people  We get into this thing  Where we try to be  As diplomatic  As you  When we're talking  In terms of  Okay look  This that and the third  In terms of  You know  The viewpoint  And I'm saying  Dude  I just want there  To be  A black  President 
[01:18:30]  Just as  A symbol  As  You don't  As a  As a symbol  Of pride  It's not that we've  Overcome  But it  It is that  A little bit  You feel like  Fuck  This is a black  President  I don't disagree  But I'm gonna tell you this  I agree that what you're saying  Is right  But I agree also this  That there  The minute  That he gets in office  They are gonna say  Hey man  You don't need  Affirmative action no more  No reparations  I'd rather cut one check  Than 33 million  And I think that 
[01:19:00]  You can't have it both ways  You gotta be  You gotta say  You know what  This is what I want  This is what I signed up for  Me personally  I believe that he is better  Than McCain  Because I think  He is a more  He is a more  Worldly person  Like he gets  He doesn't have  As myopic a view  As McCain does  How about  Okay  How about  If I didn't believe that  Armstrong Williams  Or say  Clarence Thomas  Was running against  They're the same guy to me  Was running against  McCain  Then I vote for McCain  If it was Armstrong Williams  They're the same guy  They're the same guy 
[01:19:30]  To me  I try never  I try  This is what I've always  Tried to do  I speak my mind  I ain't got no coalition  I'm gonna tell you what I think  Right  I believe Obama  Is clearly better  Than John McCain  I believe that  So  And you do too right  Right  A lot of people do  No I don't like  No me  I don't like  Obama's stance on a lot  He's too liberal for me  I'm not a liberal guy  I like fucking guns  And here's what  I like guns  Here's what  I'm offering to you  This is what I'm saying 
[01:20:00]  In terms of this  I like dope  Gun  Everything right  Bitches  I'm offering you  Then you  Then you like  What's the difference  You can shoot a bitch  Wait  Anthony just doesn't  Want to look at that face  Behind the podium  It's a white  Exactly  I think that's it  Here's what I'm offering you  Anthony on this  I'm offering you  The black presidency  Now  So that  When you make  Any statement  Based 
[01:20:30]  Not on color  As you claim  Quote unquote  Signs  Sure  Then I could possibly  Go with you  Without thinking that  I'm speaking purely  But right now  Right  Somebody said  If there was a white  If there was  If a white person said  I'm only gonna vote for him  Cause he's white  Would that be  If there had only been  Black presidents  Then if a white person said  Boy I wanna see a white president  Would I understand  Yeah  The fact is  Our commander in chief  Has been nothing but old  White guys 
[01:21:00]  If Hillary  Had it went through  I'd rather see  Just to see a woman president  Right  Then you can go  I don't like his politics  And I can go  Fair enough  Just like if you go  I don't like Donovan McNabb  If there was only one  Black quarterback ever  I'll go  You fucking racist  But  There's a lot  They broke ground  Now you can not  Like a black guy  Without that  You're not allowed  To dislike Barack Obama  Right now  He's the first  Black president  Yeah  Cause the second 
[01:21:30]  So what you're saying  What you're saying is  That no matter  Honestly  How shitty you thought he was  No matter how  So if it was between  Armstrong  Williams and John McCain  You'd still pick Armstrong  Cause he was black  As painful as that is  I couldn't do it  I couldn't do it  I'd go  It would just be  Too enormous for me  You just want an icebreaker  You want an icebreaker  I just would  I'd vote  Colin Powell  This is another thing  Too  This is what I'm saying  How come Colin Powell  And Condoleezza Rice  Aren't black leaders 
[01:22:00]  How come  Only motherfuckers  Y'all don't like  Are our leaders  You understand  Wait wait wait  Because black community  They were Uncle Tom  We don't  We don't  We don't appoint  Our fucking leaders  You do  White people do  You do  Farrakhan  And Sharpton  When is the last time  Condoleezza Rice  And Colin Powell  Gathered people  But they're black  And they're lead  Because Colin Powell  Because Colin Powell  Didn't come out  And march 
[01:22:30]  Like a Reverend Al would  I don't know one black person  That thinks Reverend Al  Is a leader  Right  I don't  Really  I don't  I personally don't know  One person  Reverend Al does  Yeah  I think leaders  Don't appoint this  So that just kind of happens  I think that I can respect  Condoleezza  I don't agree with her views  I respect what she's done  I respect what Colin Powell has done  Like you can't  Now would you vote for Colin Powell  I would vote for Colin Powell  Because I think that he's a bright  Worldly man  Who actually understands  Would you vote for Condoleezza Rice  I couldn't see voting for Condoleezza Rice 
[01:23:00]  I couldn't see  I couldn't see  This is why  I couldn't see it  I could not see it  And this is why  It has to be  A fucking black president  So that  You can just  It can  Patrice  Racism will still be there  But at least  I can listen to you  I understand what you're saying  I just need it  Patrice wants to vote  For someone based on  The color of their skin  And not the content  Of their character  I love the way you think  Did you just steal  You motherfucker  Who the fuck said that  Did you just steal  From a black man 
[01:23:30]  Who just said that  Oh fuck  Wait a minute  Don't be doing white tricks  With me  Using  I'm using Jedi  What the fuck  Am I  Obi-Wan  But you know  You know  Ask not what you can do  For your country  It's no question to me  That Barack Obama  Is clearly more  More of my mindset  Than  McCain  If he were not  Now what's his politics  If he were not  If he were not  I would not have  If he were not  I wouldn't have a problem  Not voting for him  What's his politics  That would go  Okay  I'm voting for him 
[01:24:00]  Because of his politics  Here's why I'm voting for him  Because I think  That he at least  Has  Has  A more worldly view  He's not as myopic  And he's not as connected  To one mindset  Like  Like McCain  In 2000  I loved McCain  I thought he was a smart  Independent  You know  Kind of  You know  Independent thinker  Who did  His own kind of thing  He was a maverick  I bought that thing  But is he really a myopic though  I mean he's pretty  He's a pretty liberal Republican  He's against torture  Like a lot of the things  That the conservatives  No shit he's against torture 
[01:24:30]  As opposed to what  A lot of them  Go with whatever the CIA  But he did  Weem is against plungers  McCain  McCain started pandering  To the religious right  As soon as he got in trouble  Like he started pandering  To the religious right  As soon as he got in trouble  If he believes  What he believes  That's fine  I personally believe  Barack Obama  Who did pander by the way  When he dropped  To his own church  I do not  Let me get this straight  I think  You think he was more  Qualified than Hillary  I think everybody  Lies on their job application 
[01:25:00]  I don't think he was  Any more or less  Qualified than her  But I would have  I would have been happy  With either one of them  I don't have to hate her  To love him  I didn't have to go  Ooh  She's so  I didn't have to have  You know  I didn't have to go  Ooh  She's terrible  He's great  I think  I hold all politicians  In fairly low esteem  I guarantee  He is better  To me than her  Women would have voted  And here's the cut off  This is the weird thing  I mean you can't  The strange thing is  Okay  Women  Would have had to choose  Like okay  If you're a black woman 
[01:25:30]  You would have to choose  Obama  Like either your color  Or your gender  Or whatever that case may be  If  If Hillary had made it  To the  To the primary  If she had made it through  As a candidate  I'd have voted for her  Because she's a woman  Just  I would never do that  I would never do that  I just would have to  I would never  You know what  I just  This is so fucking  It happened to be  And the fact that  They were Democrats  Made it easier  If they were Republican 
[01:26:00]  It would have been  I'm telling you  I don't believe people  Died and marched  And went through all the  Bullshit they go through  So I can hold some  Bullshit line in my head  People have to earn my respect  Just like I gotta go out there  And earn respect from people  If I don't respect a motherfucker  I'm not voting for them  I don't give a shit  What they got next to their name  Who they are  What their gender is  And I think it's that mindset  Really it's that mindset  That got people  People voted for George Bush  Clearly because they went  I want a guy who talks like me  I want a guy who  I want a guy who's just 
[01:26:30]  As dumb as I am  D.L.  Jackie Robinson  Jackie Robinson was known  Not to be the best  Not even the 10 top  Black players  Right  Was Jackie Robinson  Known to be  He was just that nigga  Which is Obama  He's that nigga  He's the mom  He got a white mom  That's exactly what you said  Meaning  Meaning  He does all the things  Jesus  All the things  That  That a black guy 
[01:27:00]  Has to do  To make white people  Feel comfortable  He's that guy  My problem is  I don't like people  When white people  Like something  I tend to go  Wow  Why do they like them  Is that a little suspicious  I'm with you  But I'm saying  Jackie Robinson  Jackie Robinson  Had to get in  He just had to get in  But we're talking  Apples and oranges  One is a baseball team  Which is purely for entertainment  Another guy is going to be  Ruling the fucking world 
[01:27:30]  I wouldn't say  And how much of the world  Is he going to be ruling  How powerful is the president  I think  The president is the fucking United States  He's a fucking symbol  Not as powerful  As a lot of people  Like to think  But pretty fucking powerful  Somebody can tell him  To go fuck himself  Like he has to get things  Voted on  He can't just make rules  Let me tell you something  George Bush  Was powerful enough  To have a fucking war  Going on  Over in Iraq  He had  No  He had the backing  Of the country  No shit  How did he get that 
[01:28:00]  How did he get that  Right  But he duped Congress  And to giving him  All the power  That's pretty powerful  Isn't it  That's not power  Whatever he did  Whatever he did  Was his fucking power  It was emotions  From the country  At the time  How is that not power  That's not fucking power  That is power  That's manipulation  Yeah  Bushy is power  Is manipulation power  Yeah  You're right  He has veto power  He has veto power  The president can veto  Almost anything  He can say no  But he can't say yes  He can veto  He can't just make rules 
[01:28:30]  He fucking got  But he did  But it was based on us  It was based on us  And everyone else  Based on our ignorance  And fear  Right  Thank you  And I'm gonna say  The same thing again  Thank you  Never will I ever  Give my vote to somebody  Just cause somebody  Tells me  I'll never be pressured  To think like anybody  What's your gut feeling  On Barack  I believe  Honestly  Your gut  Fuck all the politics  I don't know him  You don't know him  I don't know him  I don't know McCain either  So I'll take the lesser  That did though  That basically 
[01:29:00]  You said what I'm saying  No no no  What you're saying is  You would vote for  A black person  In any circumstances  What I'm saying is  Armstrong Williams  And all that shit  Is a tough one  Those are tough names  I know  Just to test myself  This is my thing  How fucked up are you  This is the indictment  Of George Bush's presidency  How fucked up president  Are you when the option is  We gonna vote for the black guy  That's what  Oh wow  When they go  We want the black guy  Your shit is  Your library is gonna be  He really fucked up  Oh my god  But I never 
[01:29:30]  I have never believed  I've never believed  And that matters  When I believe  Race is the  Is the issue  If you ask me  What I think  On any number of things  But I will never vote  For somebody  Just cause they were a woman  Or they lived in my neighborhood  Or they were this  Or they were that  You don't come to me  Just having respect  Just cause  You walk up to me  I have to know  You think you'll be emotional  If he gets  If he gets voted president  Sure  Sure I will  To see a black man  Go through the struggles  That he's gone through  And the stuff that he's gone through 
[01:30:00]  But I've never seen a  Here's my thing  I've never seen a person  So lotted  And so  So  It makes  It scares me  That people are putting  You know  You would think  Jesus is here  And he's a politician  But could he be  Could he possibly be  The dude  Let's say  Underneath all of that  Was Farrakhan Jr  Okay  Could he really  Let's say Farrakhan  Was the president  Could he really do 
[01:30:30]  What white people  Are afraid  He might do  Could he really  Well as a newly  Patriated French person  I wouldn't know  Man  I would see a split screen  Of Obama getting inducted  And just see like  Patrice and Anthony  Both crying  Completely just for a reason  But I'll tell you this  It'll be like the OJ verdict  Just like the OJ verdict  I believe  At the time 
[01:31:00]  I believe  OJ was innocent  When I watched it  Now  It's true  I believe he was innocent  Now seeing it now  I go  Wow that motherfucker did it  After that book  If I killed the bitch  When he wrote a book called  If I killed the bitch  And this is what I would have done  I wouldn't have a problem  Saying out loud  I believe he did it  But I didn't  When I watched the trial  It was very emotional for me  I just kind of went  Oh man  That's so I'm not  Proof there's a whole  Different way of looking  Because I looked at that trial  And just said he's guilty  Totally guilty 
[01:31:30]  You're politically savvy man  You're a savvy guy  You're a savvy guy  But I'm saying  There's never  You've never been racially  Things weren't racially motivated  In terms of  In your life  Like the OJ verdict  Look  Sure  Things are racially motivated man  You gotta have this thing  I'm just not gonna  I'm just gonna take that lowest road  If you wanna call it  Where I'm like  Fuck that man 
[01:32:00]  I wanna see the black president  Because we've lived through some  Fuck  This nigga  That's the president now  This goofy motherfucker  That's got us in the world  Could he be worse than him  No  Come the fuck on man  I wanna see it  I wanna see the black president  That's it  I wanna see  I'm gonna  Like  We get into the same conclusion  You taking the 405  And I'm taking the 405  I believe  That he's a better  He's the best candidate  We have now  And I believe  That he is better suited  For the gig  Than McCain  Probably cause he'll live 
[01:32:30]  Through the inauguration  But  I'm not sure McCain  Would live through the swearing in  But I would never  Me personally  Vote for something  Like OJ  I had to believe  He was innocent  I had to really believe it  And for whatever reason  And when I learned  When I  When I looked at other things  I went  Maybe he  It isn't what I thought it was  I have no problem  Admitting whether I'm wrong or right  Race plays attention  Race plays a part  In a lot of things I do  But as far as me  Voting for somebody  Or as far as me  Looking at the situation objectively  I just try to be  As human as possible  Do you think 
[01:33:00]  That the people that fought  In the civil rights movement  Jim Crow days  And all that  Do you think  Okay  That they would be happy  If he became the president  Just because he was black  I think they  Of course  Sure  So why  I don't  Well you're asking me  You're asking me  That's apples and oranges  Well not really  I'm not giving it  I'm not giving anybody anything  Just because they're anything  Is my point  No  I get your point  Nobody ever gave me one thing  Because I was anything  So I would never give that  He walks the same earth I do 
[01:33:30]  Puts on his pants the same way I do  I gotta go out and earn respect  He gotta honor and guard  We do agree  He has  He has done it too  Fuck him on  Right  Some level like he's the messiah  Yeah yeah fuck all that  We're only talking about  A symbol  And not a symbol  It's a  It's a symbol of  It might even  Like I always picture  Like niggas stop  Shooting each other  Because the black president  Like  Alright  Wouldn't that be nice  What I'm saying  If he's the black president  It's like  Let's just make him  Let's be right 
[01:34:00]  Let's  But you can't have it  Maybe it'll write us up  Just because he's the black president  You can't have it both ways  Here's what I believe  I believe that if  If he is president  And we don't as a people  Kind of go  That is our cue  To elevate ourselves  That is our cue  If this dude came from Indonesia  Hawaii  Kansas  I don't even know where he's from  So I couldn't  Like this dude  Last time I saw a dude  From that many places  He was running from the police  But  But  If he has found a way  To connect with America  That way  Then it is in us all 
[01:34:30]  And you know what  When they take everything away  Because that's what's going to happen  Everybody's going to say  You know what  If this cat can do it  All you guys can do it  Now it's a level playing field  We're giving you  This guy's elevated  From nothing  To the highest position  In the world  I think that it is a challenge  That we have to kind of accept  We have to kind of go  You know what  The game has changed  But you can't have it both ways  You can't say  You can't say  I want him to be president  And I still want all this other shit  Because you're going to give something up  To get  You got to give to get  And I really believe 
[01:35:00]  That in this situation  There is not a more  And I don't respond to him  Because he's a speaker  Because I think all  You know all politicians speak  I think that he's clearly  A more qualified candidate  If I didn't think it  Two things  I wouldn't have a problem saying it  And I wouldn't have a problem  Not voting for it  I would never vote for somebody  Just because  Somebody said that  I don't go to meetings  Where people go  Hey man  This is the way we feel about this  I'm going to tell you how I feel  I ain't part of the collective  Just like  When people feel a certain way 
[01:35:30]  About like  All the bullshit  That people get into  About how you should speak  And what you should think is funny  Ain't no collective for me  But you got to understand now  That there is  There is an outside  There is an outside effect  In terms of  Okay  Black people aren't really  The toughest thing I think  To be being black  As you're younger  Is to be individual  Is to say  Right  This is what I think  Fuck the other shit  Right  And really  I'm saying what I think 
[01:36:00]  Because I know there's a lot of black people  Who are like  Fuck that  I'm not even voting for him now  You know  I'm not going to vote for him  Because he's black  Fuck him  I don't like him  Or whatever  His stance on abortion  Is this and that  I'm saying dude  It's bigger  It's so big  Because you know  Watching Roots  And just feeling how I felt  Watching Roots  Feeling how I felt  Watching Rosewood  Just the basic instinct  Of anger you have  Towards white people  On a general basis  It's hard for me  To just be in here sometimes 
[01:36:30]  And just be your friend  And listen to my shit  But just because you're white  There's a natural instinct  Not to like white folks  You know it's so odd  And I just want  I just want to just go  You guys are a lot alike  But you know what  I look at Patrice  I look at Patrice  And go  I don't even think of you  As a black guy  And listen to God's honest truth  If you don't look at you  If you're walking down the street  I'd fucking be on the other side  Of the street  In a second  But see that's why  I understand 
[01:37:00]  I understand that shit  It's like you know  Knowing you  Me and Lloyd would never be friends  Outside of the fact  That we're friends  I wouldn't bump into them  In the street or whatever  There is a just  I just would love  To feel something  That I know I've never  Really felt before  Externally  Externally  But that's different though  Patrice  That's a sense of  That's different  I want to see a black president  I get it  But I would never vote for somebody  Just because they were anything  And you said something 
[01:37:30]  That was absolutely true  The hardest thing  For a black person to do  Is to be an individual  Is to say  This is how I feel  This is  Like Michael Vick dude  I fucking hated that  Motherfucker for that  But people  You know  You get a preponderance  Of the media  Where black people go  Nigga  Black people don't give a fuck  About no dogs  And I'm like  I love dogs  Me too  But I didn't  That's nuance for me  Like with the whole  Don Amis thing  I thought it was a dumb joke  And I thought it was 
[01:38:00]  You know  I don't think  What I do is  I go  How the fuck do I feel  I don't go on the  Black America website  I don't go  And that's a hard  That's a hard thing to do  I do that too  It's very  Fucking difficult  When I was defending  Don Amis  Right  I'm telling you  And it's not even here  Motherfuckers are my spacing  I'm like  Are you fucking kidding me  Did you just call me  Uncle fucking pal  I'm here defending  Any black  That's why I called DL  Yeah  Which I 
[01:38:30]  I love this too  This is a great story  Which made me start  Calling people from  A block number  I reached out  I found this motherfucker  To get me to call  He called me from  A block number  And didn't give me  His fucking phone number  I'm sorry  No but I'm saying  That made me  I didn't realize  I hadn't given you money  You know  And I said to myself  I go  You know  I'm doing that shit too  Niggas ain't gonna have  My motherfucking number  You know  This is the truth  What a great statement  About  What a great statement  About career positions 
[01:39:00]  I'm gonna tell you  This is what I  What I teach  My son particularly  Man  A man stands by himself  Like it ain't never  I'm like  My father said  You came in this world  You're probably gonna die alone  You're gonna come  You can go out of the world alone  Man being an individual  And having your own mindset  And understanding how you feel  Is the ultimate responsibility  And it's the ultimate freedom  To me  I want my son  If he's nothing else  To be human  And to literally  Look at the situation 
[01:39:30]  Bravo  No no no  Not the grandstand  And to  No man respect  He hasn't earned  Simply because he's anything  Simply because he's an athlete  Simply because he  You give any human being  A certain amount of respect  Just for me personally  I don't  I don't look  At what people tell me  I look at what they do  But look  There's something deeper  About black people's illness  In terms of this  Like  This is what  You don't  Is this BET  We radio  There's no people  What are these motherfuckers doing 
[01:40:00]  You know  There's some truckers  Driving off  Real quick  Screaming at the radio  Why aren't you guys  Saying anything  Let the two niggas  Fight it out  All this  Oogly boogly talk  Why don't they just  Why don't they just  Play bongos  Help us  They've hijacked us  We're just scared of talk  First up  The president  Now they've taken over  The Oprah and Anthony show  Hey Patrice  By the way  And give me some chicken  There's 304 million people 
[01:40:30]  In the United States  And there's 243 million whites  And just under  40 million blacks  You know white people  Come up with that  Wait a minute  So is how many  People in the country  We'll go on the website  And you said this then  There's 304 million people  In this country  Yeah you said there's  300 million whites  200 and what  43  43 million  Whites  And 40 million blacks  Yes  There's only 20 more million  Other motherfuckers here  Chinese  Well you gotta count some Spanish people  That are black  That they don't know  Are you serious 
[01:41:00]  That's what they're saying  Only that's wrong  That's what they're saying  You can't say that's wrong  I'm saying that's fucking wrong  There's no more fucking  God damn Puerto Ricans  And Mexicans  In this country  Than us  Puerto Ricans are just  Niggas who can swim  That's all they are  They're the same thing  They count as all  Hold on hold on  No these are  The same thing  This is probably  This is probably citizens  The same thing  What is that from 19 what  01  July 2008  This is what's gonna be estimated  Next month when they put the numbers out  But I mean these are 
[01:41:30]  These are citizens obviously  This isn't the illegals  Why don't we take a break  We got D.L. Hughley in studio  Dude I can't get the passion up  To talk politics  I just can't  It's not even a politics thing  Nah this is all just a human thing  I like the point that D.L. said  And being an individual  Is probably the most important thing  Well he said it first  But you said it first  No cause Patrice is saying  He's  Oh no wait  Wait before you finish  My brain is fried  Okay  So I wanted to say something  Real quick  Real quick about  You never say anything real quick 
[01:42:00]  Alright  Fucking  Let me say something  I'm gonna try to say something  Real quick  Go  They understand  Trust me  Is the black  Is that  Is when  That's the one thing about  Okay  When we  Do something  Like when we do something  Yeah  It's like  Oh you people  We  We have to defend  Every black dude  That's the thing  No we don't  We don't  I know what you're saying  We don't  But I'm saying  Externally  We don't  But internally 
[01:42:30]  For some reason  When a nigga fucks up  All of the black people  Gotta go  Oh  We gotta make an excuse  I don't  And you don't  But as  As a whole group  You know what I'm saying  But white people  When white people fuck up  That white person  Fucked up  Not the whole  As a whole  You get to enjoy  Being an individual  You're right  Cause as white people  Even without the pressure  Externally of going  There's never  White pride  There's never  Open white pride  Yeah because people  You can't 
[01:43:00]  Yeah  Holy shit  You can't fucking  I would love to  March down the street  Hey whitey  You can't fucking do it  You can do it  If it wasn't  If I was  Well that's true  But I just  You know what it is  If I wasn't  Half Sicilian too  And by the way  We do have white pride  Every time we see each other  In the supermarket  We'll look at pasteurized milk  Just kind of waking each other  Open heart surgery  Oh we do that  Did you really  You know what's  To me is this  Everybody always  Everybody always  Asks  I always get 
[01:43:30]  Even when I came in  For the first time  How do black  I can never tell you  How black people feel  We're a whole race  Of people that got  How can you talk  For one race of people  That got flavor  Of Flav  And Colin Powell  Right  You know what I'm saying  How does one dude  Encapsulate all those  All you can ever do  Is speak  And I hate people  Anybody  Who doesn't speak  Their own mind  Who goes with  The collective  Is a fucking sheep  That's all you are  All you're doing  Is what somebody  Told you  You might as well  Be a fucking robot  I get it  I understand  That's easier to do  I understand  That's why 
[01:44:00]  I hate the party line shit  Like why  If I'm a republican  Why do I have to  Be against women  Getting abortions  But that's  Unless they're mine  Yeah  Like I'm a fucking  Huge second amendment guy  But I'm also  For a woman's right  To choose  I'm insane then  As a fucking republican  But my thing is  That I just became  A democrat two years ago  I was an independent  For all of you  Because I never even  Like the kind  I like to pick  I like guns  I think  Well let me tell you  Something  Guns 
[01:44:30]  Now that's against  Your party  No it ain't  For the most part  But look here  I dig guns  I dig abortion  I think  We should be legal  I think that  We are too  Fiscally irresponsible  I think that  The  I think that  You want less  Government in your life  I want a lot  Less government in my life  I think that religion  Is encroaching too much  In government  So what I've done  Is tell you how I feel  I didn't  I don't go  What does the D say  Or what does the R say  I'll tell you how I feel  But most of the people 
[01:45:00]  In these parties  That you're forced  Pretty much to vote for  Because they fucking see  Run right along the party line  So who the fuck  Are you going to vote for  But even that  Even like when  Everybody's having  The black president  I got all that confusion  Out motherfucker  The black president  Party line  My left ball  Nigga  When they was having  The primaries  I didn't think  I don't think  That America responds  To inferior talk  I think that America  Want  Like people are  We're not going to respond  To the politics of fear  Your whole fucking life  Is fear  Your mother says  Do this  Or that'll happen  This job says 
[01:45:30]  Either do this  Or I'll fire you  Religion says  Do this  Or you're going to hell  Fear runs us all  The bottom line to me is  I think that  America gets what it wants  And it always  It makes poor decisions  Because it's generally  Ill-informed  And makes decisions  Based on all kind of  Bullshit  It's 50 million Americans  Don't have health care  You ask the average person  Do they think you should  Have health care  They go  Yeah you should have  You say socialized medicine  And then they go  Fuck you  I'm not paying for it  I don't think you should 
[01:46:00]  Die in this country  I don't care  If you're lazy  Or whatever  I was just in  Edmonton, Alberta  They have the best  Economy in the northern  Whoa whoa whoa  Motherfucker  Why wasn't there  An interruption there  Jack  Because I'm waiting  To talk about  How Senator Kennedy  And his brain tumor  Because you hate this  Fucking health care thing  And if we had  Socialized medicine  Like Senator Kennedy wanted  He would still have  That fucking orange  In his head  Why is that  Because you don't  Fucking step up  To a hospital  Get the best doctor  And say  Hey take the tumor 
[01:46:30]  Out of my head  You wait on a fucking list  You sit and wait  For a fucking doctor  You're not getting  The best doctor  So you should get  Socialized fucking medicine  But he's a rich motherfucker  And he was able  To get whatever he wants  And that's America  You're not  Why the fuck  Did this country  Turn into something  Where everyone's entitled  To something  Let me ask you something  Instead of working  Up to him  Because we have  Working up to getting  The brain tumor  Removed from your head  One is  What the fuck  Is wrong with you  He's a spoiled bastard  Exactly  He is a spoiled bastard  We have to do two things 
[01:47:00]  If we're not going to be  The America we espouse  Then let's not  Like let's be Russian  Let's be as shitty  As we think  As we say now  But we're going to put  God in our constitution  And we're going to act  Like we're a judo  Christian society  And we're  Judeo Christian society  And we are  A nation of laws  And rules  And we're a nation  Of human rights  And dignity  A human being  Should never die  Because it is  They're poor  I don't give a fuck  Why they are  Anyone can go into  The fucking hospital  You go to the emergency room  Some people are going to 
[01:47:30]  Get shitty care  Some people are going to  Get good care  Hold on  Did you just hear  That point  I did  Did you used to be poor  Yes  Do you think you should  Have been dead  If you couldn't afford to live  You know something  If I was fucked up  When I was poor  Then I'd be dead  That's the fucking  Country  I asked you  Do you think  You should be dead  Because you couldn't afford  To be alive  Uh  No  But in certain circumstances  That's just the way  This fucking is  We are a country  That fights to have  The Pledge of Allegiance  And we fight to have  Prayer in school 
[01:48:00]  We fight to have  Prayer in school  Right  We fight to bring  God in our lives  That's based on this  Puritanical bullshit  That started hundreds  Of years ago  But I'm saying  If you are going to  Put God in your life  And talk about  How you love Jesus  And how we're  A Christian society  The very tenet of Jesus  Regardless of what  People think  Is that you love the poor  And the sick  That's what you do  Now if you're going  To take Jesus out  And we're going to  Be a country  That is just kind of  A pluralistic country  And we don't give a fuck  About anything  That's fine  But if you're going  If you're going to  Talk about how much  You love Jesus  Then and how much  How  You can't 
[01:48:30]  You can't be president  Unless you do  You can't literally  Be president in the  United States of America  Unless you go to church  And kill convicts  Well you know  You can't  You can't  Obama pretty soon  Is going to have to  Shoot something  Well your personal  Fucking religion  Your personal shit  As far as religion goes  Isn't supposed to  And you said  Isn't supposed to  Encroach in on the government  But it does  But it's not supposed to  It's written there  Separation of church and state  Well we're not supposed to  Pay taxes but we do  Exactly  I don't like that either  Okay so  But the thing is  You're just a fucking 
[01:49:00]  You're poor rich trash  Like you're rich  You're hysterical Patrice  You're just a piece of garbage  But you're a millionaire  Let me just  Let me just  Let me just say this  Fucking bastards  When did this country  Become the country  Where everyone's entitled  To the same fucking thing  There are poor people  There are rich people  Hold on  Hold on  There are poor people  And there are rich people  In this country  It's what this country's based on  If you're lucky  And you make something of yourself  You have some skill  Whatever the fuck it is  Listen to your laugh  No I'm laughing 
[01:49:30]  This is what America is made for  No I'm laughing  Some people fall on their ass  And fucking get nowhere  I'm laughing  And others  Because there's a lot of  Ass fallen people  That's what this whole  Fucking country  Was based on  No the country was built  It wasn't based to come here  Because we're gonna give you  What the fuck you want  This country was based  Wasn't a guarantee  On exploiting  It really was  It was based on  Black labor  It was black labor  Free black labor  Then it was Italians  Then it was Africans  Now it's the Mexicans  It's that new term  They the new niggas  But the bottom line is  This country was based 
[01:50:00]  On exploiting somebody  And getting rich from it  That's what happened  Now it is becoming a place  Where people have felt bad  About their past  And are trying to right  A lot of the wrongs  Of the past  So a lot of things  That wouldn't have  Happened  White guilt  But if we  If we are going to be  A country where  Every time I turn around  Some politician  Is saying  We are the moral authority  In the world  And right after that  A commercial will come off  A girl's gone wild  If we're going to be  A moral authority  If we're going to  Constantly talk about Jesus  And constantly talk about  Elements  Like the country now  Talking about change  We need to change 
[01:50:30]  We need to change  The two men  We are the we  We've been waiting for  We  It's changing the tone  Of the country  Then you have to accept  All  Just like I told him  You have to accept  All that comes along  With when Obama's  You have to accept  The fact that this country  Is going to have to do  Some of the things  That actually expires  So people are  So then everyone  Is entitled  By just being an American  You're entitled  To certain things  Whether you  Work for them or not  Whether you're  Lucky enough  To have  I don't think  You should  I don't think  Any human being  I think that we  Place such a value 
[01:51:00]  On  We love money  So much in this country  We put God  On our money  So we can have  Everything in the same space  But to me  I just am  From a human standpoint  I just don't believe  That people  Your care should be better  Than some people  Because you can afford it  Everybody should  Everybody  Everybody should eat  Everybody should eat  Because if you don't eat  You'll be dead  So if everybody can't eat  You're just dead  Some motherfuckers  Just  They don't have enough food  To fucking eat 
[01:51:30]  Why?  What?  Because they're lazy  Pieces of shit  No I don't know  I'm asking you why  Because fucking  Look man  Motherfuckers  Look man  Some people  Can't  Look  When I grew up  We was on welfare  And  I'm going to be quite honest  My mother was stealing it  So was I  Listen to me  My mother was stealing it  So was mine  But  Okay  She wasn't stealing it  And I was walking around  With the brand new Nike  She was stealing it  Working  And on welfare  Yep  Just  To get a little bit more 
[01:52:00]  Just some food  Some extra  Fucking food  Cause to eat right  A fucking fish  One fish  75 dollars a pound  A whole pig  A dime  You know what I'm saying  Like you can eat a whole  Fucking pig for nothing  And die  Or you can try to eat right  And lettuce is this expensive  Or fish is that expensive  Or fucking  Something that's not gonna give you  A fucking heart attack  Cost more money  Than the average thing  It's fucked up  If you can come out  Of your god damn 
[01:52:30]  Shelby money  And fucking  Give me  A piece of corn  Where does it  Fucking have to stop then  Do we all have to  Equal out  That's communism  Thank you  Thanks for saying it then  You know what's funny to me  Thanks for saying it  When I grew up  I remember me and my mother  Having to  You cause when you go on  We used to get  Food  Lunch tickets  And I remember  Watching my father  My mother made him  Fill out the thing  So she can get  A little extra  And I watched my father cry  And I said  And I never understood 
[01:53:00]  But he hated the fact  That he had to  Subjugate himself  To get a little extra  That taught me  I'm always going to  I believe that I'm going  To be as human as possible  Of course if you work hard  There's some lazy  Motherfuckers out there  That don't deserve  You know  To live in a great house  Nothing right  I'm not saying that  You shouldn't die  Like the mortgage crisis  Here's the thing we do  Who thought it was a good idea  To give a motherfucker  Make a $3.35 an hour  A million dollar home number  Exactly  But who's the dumb motherfucker  That looks at his budget  And decides  He's going to get that house  Then we do 
[01:53:30]  Then we do this  That's fine  I get that  We'll bail out the bank  That made the predatory loans  But not the people that took them  We'll bail out railroads  That are a shitty business model  But not the people that ride them  We'll bail out the airline industry  Like after 9-11  We gave them billions of dollars  And they're a shitty business model  And now seven of those people  Are going  We'll give corporations chances  That we never give human beings  That's my problem  If you take welfare away  From poor people  And you say  You ain't fucking working  But you'll give those  You'll give those same tax breaks 
[01:54:00]  To Exxon and Mobile  Who don't even need it  And you don't blink an eye at it  I agree with that to a point  But the reason the airlines  Got bailed out  And the railroads  And stuff  Is because we need  Fucking planes  This poor motherfucker  That went broke  We don't need  We don't need  It's seven  You know why airlines go broke  That's why they're going broke  Yeah  Because they're shitty business models  Because they're late  They pay too much money  And you know what happens  To a shitty business model  It goes away  We don't need 19,000 airlines  We just need good ones 
[01:54:30]  And efficient ones  You know the only airline  That didn't have to lay out for anybody  Or take any money from the government  Was Southwest  Now everybody laughs at them  And talks about this  They're a great business model  It's because they weren't  Fucking paying the mechanics  To fix the place  Yeah  Motherfuckers are flying  But the thing about it is  We look at corporations  Differently than we look at people  Now I understand we need corporations  But you would never  You'll tell me how  You shouldn't bail out the people  That made a predatory loan  Banks went ripping those people off 
[01:55:00]  Left and right  And what they figured would happen  They wouldn't be able to make the loan  That pay them  And we'll get the house back  And can sell it again  They didn't know they were going to  All of a sudden have a whole  Soap as a house  They couldn't sell it  I know but  People sometimes are fucking stupid  Do you think you're getting  Ten million dollars from Nigeria  In your email  Was the bank stupid though  You don't give a fuck Anthony  Was the bank stupid  The bank was stupid  No apparently the bank  Is pretty fucking smart  Knowing they're going to  Foreclose on a house  Are there any  But now the banks are in trouble  Because they can't 
[01:55:30]  Now they're stupid  Are there any people in need  So let's say  It was two stupid people  We just chose  The richer stupid person  That's what happened  We bail out those banks  Are there any people in need  That you give a fuck about  That you go  Man these people need help  And I would like to help  It's the people on commercials  That I never fucking see  And you know who it is  It's these fucking father  Mother  And two kids  In a homeless shelter  That just ain't ever  In a fucking homeless shelter  They fell through the cracks  Of society  The husband lost his job 
[01:56:00]  This could happen to any man  No  It's a lunatic  In a snorkel jacket  On a hundred degree day  Fucking going  Can I get some money  That's the fucking shit  That's  That's the needy  That I don't give a fuck about  Can you do the black snorkel  Homeless man again  Can I have some money  You know him  Oh fuck  I know him a lot  I have  I have  Like  There are people  I don't have tolerance  I don't have tolerance  For bullshit  Yeah  I don't either  I'm tired of people  You know 
[01:56:30]  Doing whatever the fuck  They do  And I chase mullet headed  White fucking junkies away too  I tell them  Go fuck yourself  You ain't getting a quarter from me  I'm also tired of people  Like I just think  If the government did  Four things  I'd be fine  I think if they gave everybody  A decent quality education  I think if they  Gave you some level  Gabe  Isn't that in place  Hold on  Isn't that in place  If someone does well  In school  How can you do  I don't understand  Let me give you an example  From my life  My kids went to school  In inner city  In Los Angeles  In 1996  I moved to the valley 
[01:57:00]  Which is the same school district  But it's the valley  Los Angeles school district  My kids were three years  And they were doing well  At that school  Three years behind those people  Three years  They were doing shit  At that school  That we had never even seen  Why  I had to  I don't know why  That's just it  Why  I can't tell you why  Like I don't have the  I don't have the why  And plus that ain't a good joke  Why  I don't know what that is  You fucking up my human interest  You an asshole  But  So I had to pay  To this day 
[01:57:30]  To this day  I had to pay  Tutors  To catch my children up  And unfortunately  I was able to do it  My daughter goes to Smith  You know  I'm very proud of her  My son  Is in college  My daughter  She gonna be my daughter  That's the fuck she gonna be  For the rest of her life  But  She ain't the brightest motherfucker  No matter how much I pay in tutors  But  But the idea  That they go to the same school district  That they worked hard  That I thought  I was doing everything  I needed to do  And they were still  Three years behind  And you ask me why  And I tell you  I don't know  I can't tell you  Because now  It's richer out there 
[01:58:00]  So I think that there's more  And certainly there's more involvement  It used to be a PT  You know  Parents were  There's  I don't think it's 100% of one thing  I think it's 1% of 100 things  I think the parents need to be more involved  In their children's lives  Absolutely  I think that we need to place  A higher premium on education  But all of us do  Like I was reading  We don't  None of us  We have to give hundreds of thousands  Of work visas away  Because we're not educated enough  To do the job  That involves mathematics  We have to hire  You know this child thing  Has nothing to do with Anthony  No  You know something  Let's move along from children 
[01:58:30]  I pay motherfucking school taxes  Up the ass  Why?  Where I am  Because  I don't have any kids  But I gotta pay  For the fucking schools  In my neighborhood  In my neighborhood  I gotta pay for the fucking schools  Because they don't want  They don't want the kids  Fucking winging rocks  Through my windows  So  Even people without kids  Gotta pay through the fucking ass  For the school tax  Well fuck  I don't give a fuck about that  Fuck the kids  Fuck the kids  Yeah  The children should be homeless  Yeah fuck the children 
[01:59:00]  A very special episode  Of opening it  You joke around  You joke around  But they do use their fucking  Like five and six year old age status  To fucking get away with shit  Yeah  God damn  This motherfucker here  And  And that's what I have to say about that  So thank you  I can't wait to see  Come on  I can't wait to see  Richard Huff's article tomorrow  Opie straightens everyone out  Yes  Opie's race discussion 
[01:59:30]  Groundbreaking  Right  You're gonna be on the top of  Yeah I do  I'm gonna be on the top of  The Drudge Report  Later today  Opie solves race problems  In America  Can we all agree on that thing  Yes  We have to take a leak  Yeah  Yeah  Hey now  This is D.L. Hugh  And you listen to the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  You can't get no worse than this  Thanks  Opie and Anthony  Hey it's Opie and Anthony  Hi  And this is the worst  Of Patrice O'Neill  On the Opie and Anthony show  And now we have to take this time  To kind of make fun of Patrice 
[02:00:00]  For a second Anthony  How do you make fun of Patrice  When he talks to you  In the privacy of my own home  Or a car  With the doors locked  Windows up  It's easy  How do you make fun of Patrice  When he doesn't allow you to talk  Come on  I'll let you talk  Stop  Enough with the high pitched  Talking and the laugh  We get it  You're black  Hey E-Rock  This was a great idea  Why don't you just play  The fucking thing  Obviously we can't improv  Jesus  And I can't even say improv  Jesus  Will you get me the fuck  Out of this bit  Thank you 
[02:00:30]  No matter what he's doing  Oh my god  That's his legacy  It never ended  That's his getting shot in the head  Oh my god  He's the black president  I need a nap  Oh my god  I agree with Patrice  I'm with you  I agree with Patrice on that  What we talked about during break  Hey  That never happens  We're back with a live studio audience  I want to do something really quick  I need another threesome  Let's get  Let's get people  I want to know how many people out there 
[02:01:00]  We have a very white audience  Looking at us  That's true  And I want to know  How many of these guys and gals  Are voting for McCain  Raise your hand  Of course  Why would you even ask  That's not  Look it's not even  Of course  Shut up  Keep your hands up  What do you want  Yeah  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven  Hold on  Hold on  Do you see  You fucking liars  Shut up  I'm trying to get an accurate count here  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight 
[02:01:30]  It looks like  How many of you traitors  So we got eight for McCain  How many for Obama  There's a lot  Three  Four  Oh two  If that's the ratio  It's over now  Wait  Out of eleven  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Man bro  What  That's  That's over twenty-five percent though  I mean when you look at it like that  Three  And eight  Is  That  Out of eleven people  That is over twenty-five percent  Yeah but there's more than eleven  So what's going on with the other guys  You're just  That's what I'm saying 
[02:02:00]  Maybe they're wigs  Some of them  Kept their hand down  And then left  It's a dangerous thing  Mike  What happened  Who's  They're on  Everybody's on  Oh what happened  Yeah  No headphones  So what did that guy  He jumped up  What  Oh I'm definitely not voting for John McCain  No way  It's ludicrous  We've already lost four thousand men in this war  We definitely need a change in America  And I think Obama's pretty optimistic  I certainly think he's qualified  Since DL mentioned before  Where somebody had some thoughts while that discussion 
[02:02:30]  The hand went up  When the hand goes up  It's going to be a fucking wall  Dude  Dude  Everybody's got to just do themselves  You know what dude  Black or white  Fat Bob Kelly  Oh  Oh  Oh  He made a point about Obama not being  Being there for votes  And voting present  As opposed to voting yes or no  A friend of mine made a point about that  A lot of times  Things go through  And you don't want to go against the party  But you don't want to support it either  And that's one of the reasons Obama did have that voting record 
[02:03:00]  At least the guy was there  Most of these motherfuckers aren't even there  But that's my  Here's my thing  I think politicians do what they do  To get  It's like  Like I said earlier  Everybody's filling out  This is the biggest job application  I don't know one motherfucker  That tells the truth on a job application  I don't know one  So I don't look at politicians  I judge them  And I kind of go  They serve a purpose  They good  But I don't look at them  As being agents of change  Or goodness  All they care about  Is what gets them elected  That's just it 
[02:03:30]  And gets them to the next gig  I agree with that shit  I agree Obama's doing that  The same way as everybody else  I have a high  Sense of self esteem  Of esteem for them  If they're good at their job  But people can say whatever they want  About George Bush  And this is the one good thing  I'll say about him  I don't even know what I can say  But he said  He didn't use slick talk  And great rhetoric  And lilting rhetoric  To get shit done  He bullied people  And he was politically effective  Like he got shit done  It was all the wrong shit  But he wasn't in there  Talking nice to those people 
[02:04:00]  He's like  Motherfucker you do it  Or I'm gonna make it  Politically hot for you  He got a lot of democrats  They lost their job  So I think that he was  A political  He was politically effective  Just all the wrong shit  So I don't think  You have to be nice  I think that  The people  Place  Are putting politicians  In places  I don't think they belong  I think they're just  You know  They're not civil rights workers  They're not humanitarians  These motherfuckers  Are trying to get a library  And that's why I keep him  I mean  He might be a great dude  He can speak great  I'm gonna vote for him 
[02:04:30]  But don't  Don't expect me  To suck his dick  I just think he  I just  I think he's  I hope he's good  At his key  Ask them  I'll be asked  If anybody's voting  That knows nothing  About politics  What he said  I don't think anyone's  Gonna fess up  For knowing nothing  That's what I'm saying  There's a bunch  You don't think  You think there's a couple  Of guys over here  That's just voting  They just vote  Because that's who  They're gonna vote for  These two or three dummies  Over there  And I think that  That's more people  Than you fucking realize  Man  Let's go to Stalker Patty 
[02:05:00]  Who are you voting for  In the upcoming election  I think Obama's  The only candidate  Out of the three  Who were out there  That's capable  Of doing the job  Who's the three  Hillary  And McCain  She dropped out  Hillary's out  Yeah  You know  McCain's  Hillary's out  She just said  Fuck that  I'm gonna go on my ramp  She'll just keep talking  She's just insane  People that aren't running  I think that Hillary  I think Gary Hart's  In trouble  I'm gonna vote for Obama  I'm gonna say that shit  And she's still talking 
[02:05:30]  Patty  I was interjecting humor  Do you know that  Hillary's out of it  Yes I know that  So why'd you say three  So why'd you say three  I've been with Obama  All along  Because he's strong enough  To handle it  No you weren't  You used to  You bad mouthed him  Because you were for Hillary  No I wasn't  I remember that  You were like Obama  I wouldn't vote for him  He's too racially motivated  You said all that  Did I?  No  I totally made that up  You Jedi mind tricked her  But that exactly  Is who's voting  She had no idea 
[02:06:00]  Thank you Jim  That's who's voting  Perfect example  Perfect example  Patricia  Can you vote  You're allowed to vote  Patty  Yeah  Exactly  Why not  That's what the fuck  That's who's voting  Excuse me  That's who's voting  Yeah  I'm glad Hillary got out  Because  The race was taking us  She started to look like  She started to look like  Willie Nelson  Didn't she  The model for the nickel  For a little while  Hillary  Hillary Clinton  Goodness gracious  She looks like Willie Nelson  But less fuckable  I'm like baby 
[02:06:30]  Go down and take a nap  I wanted to marry  So I could cheat on her  But I didn't  She's not happy with a man  Unless his dick smells like someone else  I smell like Mentos  I'll stay with him  Fucking  Oh my goodness  Any other political commentary  We haven't really gone to the crowd  Well ask the big dude right there  The big  Oh yeah  Bob Kelly  Bob Kelly  Ask this dude  Dude  What do you got buddy 
[02:07:00]  Who are you voting for  McCain  Okay  What do you like about McCain  Other than his wife  Exactly  Look at Patrice  Patrice has done nothing  For the past two hours  And talk about how he's only voting for  A black man  Because he's black  No no no  I'm not mad at that  I'm saying  He's white because he's white  This is what I mean  White people can  They're not allowed  To just be honest  They have to figure out a way  Well give us permission 
[02:07:30]  Please  I'm just saying  I'm voting for the dude  Because he's black  But white people have to go  Well his stance on  No that's not true  Look at this motherfucker  Trying to make up some shit  I'm trying to give you an answer here  I don't like the liberals  So I try to go  That's fair  Wow  By liberals he means the black people  Of course  You know what I  But I don't give a fuck  Because I  Let me tell you something  Even if he came up with some magical shit  I still believe 
[02:08:00]  In what I believe  So it's nothing  I'm prejudging him  And he's not going to say anything  That makes me go  Fair enough  You made such a fair point  Against Obama  And for McCain  That I'm with you  And I'm open minded like that  No you're not  I am  I'm open minded  In terms of  A motherfucker  That's logical  You know  If it makes sense  I'm going to go with it  Dude  I believe that he's not voting for Obama  Because he's black 
[02:08:30]  But he has to figure out some shit  That he hasn't even figured out  Okay let me ask you something  Honestly  What if  Like I  I hate conservatives  I do  Armstrong  You gave me an example  Of Armstrong Williams  Or  I don't like them  I think that  No offense  I like you  But you know  Some of my best friends  Are conservatives  But how come  I would never extend somebody  Or deny somebody  A right  I feel like I have  That's what that whole  Don Irons thing  Was about  Yes  There you go  If I'm allowed to do it  Somebody else should be allowed  The liberals were the ones  Who attacked him  The only conservatives 
[02:09:00]  Defended him  Especially speech  I think black people  Black comedians  Should have been the first people  Defending anything that had to do with language  Right so I don't like conservatives  I don't care if they were black  They were a woman  They were the first midget  I don't give a fuck  What they were the first of  I don't like them  Why am I allowed to say  I would never vote for them  Because they're conservative  And he's not allowed to say  He'd never vote for them  DL  I'm gonna tell you why  It is what it fucking is  Right  But wait  It's not magic  It's double standard  I agree with you  And I'm not saying 
[02:09:30]  That I give a fuck that he can't  It's just white people  White guilt  See black people have  A little to do  With what the fuck  Y'all do to yourselves  It's some  Really some civil war  Happening with white people  Where you make each other  Feel uncomfortable  We don't even have  A say in it  White guilt is the thing  That makes him  Not be able to go  I just don't want to  Vote for a black guy  We didn't do that shit  Did you see  I was  This is so  I feel so stupid  I was in the same  Four seasons we were at 
[02:10:00]  When we were doing the  In Washington  I was  John Zogby was there  From the Zogby Reuters poll  And I had lunch with him  It was the day after  The Pennsylvania primary  21%  And he was talking  About the exit poll  21% of the voters there  Said the race was a problem  That they would rather  Stay home  Than vote for Obama  17% of Catholic voters  There was a Catholic voter  Said that they would  They would vote for  They would rather  They stay home  So that's 38% of that vote  Those are people  Who said out loud  I ain't vote for this nigga 
[02:10:30]  They didn't say that out loud  They said it  No  They said it  Behind something  Whatever they said  They were open about it  They said it  I can say I'm a vote for Obama  Or whatever  But when I go  Only if they have cameras  Pointing right at you  When you push these buttons  And you go  Oh yes Obama  And you go  Whoops  Not that nigga  They can say  What they want to say  But outwardly  White people  Aren't gonna go  I'm not voting for him  Because he's black 
[02:11:00]  You'll never find it  Well I think that's  Parts of the country  The west  They voted for him  In big numbers  White people  According to white people  There's no racism  More in the west  In the east  Don't exist  But not in the middle  Of the country  It's there but  I've never met a racist  I've never met one  Let's ask Roland  Roland who are you voting for  Joe 
[02:11:30]  Roland's a huge  Springsteen fan  So whatever  Made a lot of people  Vote for him  But there's honesty  Patrice  That's the reason  Why Roland's  Voting for Obama  Still didn't say race  Though we talking  About the honesty  Of race  though. There's other things that play into this  too.  Patrice is right again. I'll give it to you.  I hate the whole white guilt thing  and that white people can't just say  the white guilt vote's going to be big.  Yeah, you're right.  A lot of white people just feel guilty and paternalistic. 
[02:12:00]  And they hope to God  this will end racism. Please let this end  in this inner  horror that I have.  One way or another.  Either with peace and love or through a race war.  I'm at  a moral  impasse. I can't take it anymore.  But you know what's so funny? Everybody acts like  this is the first time  in history this has happened. Like this is the most  significant moment in modern history.  And it's pretty significant for this country.  But in South Africa, I think it was 
[02:12:30]  pretty significant. That was a majority.  That Mandela majority was a prisoner  and became president. Was it the same democratic process  though? They voted.  They voted. Well, you know what the big thing was?  Anything white.  A whole lot of African  and a whole lot of dead  white people.  I think that you gotta  put this  I am very  part of me is  I'm very proud to see  something. I'm very  I always wait for the shit in the game  to see what's going on. I'm very proud 
[02:13:00]  to see a black man  ascending  something I never thought. Barry, I never  even thought possible. Even when I did my  HBO special, I couldn't think that this  I couldn't wrap my mind around it.  But I'm also a realist that I don't believe  and this is just as a dude. I don't  I think most politicians aren't shit  and I think  but that's I hold them a little  business as usual.  I absolutely agree.  I don't think this motherfucker  I think he's a goddamn politician.  Right.  That's what I think he is. 
[02:13:30]  So anybody who wants to be the president is a fucking  sickening crazy motherfucker anyway, but fuck it.  But don't tell me how they're going to change the world.  Oh, the world will be warmer and nicer.  Your job is to do what the American people want you to do.  That's your gig.  Before Doug Williams, all I wanted was Doug Williams.  Now I want fucking who's going to make my team win.  You know what I think Obama will do?  But before that, I want Doug Williams, man, too.  So would you take Doug Williams over time, Brady? 
[02:14:00]  Fuck no.  Okay.  Not now.  Then I would have.  I would have been that like, fuck that.  I want to see this happen.  You know what I think Obama's going to do?  Not now.  Foreign policy.  I think he's going to do much better because I think other  people in other countries are going to.  Remember when Jesse went over to free that in Libya?  Yes.  He got the little hostages free just so the Libyans could go.  Go fuck yourself.  Right.  We're giving him to Jesse.  Yes.  I think he's going to do better in foreign policy.  Absolutely.  Because I think the foreign dignitaries are going to 
[02:14:30]  know that like people are going to be like, motherfucker.  They're going to give him some extra oil and take home  in his jacket.  That's because he's black.  Right.  Take that with you.  Take a couple of battles just for you.  The rest of the country.  And you know what?  The people, the economy is really all about,  like the global economy is really all about emotion.  Like people hate us right now.  Yeah.  And they want to, like that ill will is in the zeitgeist.  People want us fucked over and broke.  That's the same reason that the Iranian hostages were released.  It was a slap of Carter for taking the Shah.  Right.  And when protecting the Shah of Iran after the Islamic revolution. 
[02:15:00]  The second Reagan got in, the hostages were out.  They were set free.  It was all a slap in the face of Jimmy Carter.  But I think that, I think that, I just, I just have a problem  with people acting like this is Jesus.  Like it's, I'm like, man, you've never met one great human being  who was a politician.  Can you name something bigger in your lifetime than the possibilities of this?  I'm not, I'm not negating, no, the possibility that a black dude gets a great job.  It's what we're talking about. 
[02:15:30]  That a black man gets a great job.  It's bigger than that though, man.  The greatest thing in my life.  There's going to be some inner, the same reason, when you first saw Roots, right?  You remember how you felt when you first saw it.  Yeah, but that was a, that was a historical.  But when, man, when this motherfucker gets up on there, up on this goddamn podium,  and he says, white babies are now legal to eat.  When, when he gets up there and you see him getting ready to say, I am the, I am your president.  You can't help and you can't help, but something take over, man. 
[02:16:00]  I'm proud of him for doing it.  But this is a black dude who's got a job who hopefully will do a great job.  It's going to be bigger than that.  I hope he make it just so I remember this conversation, man.  You think it's going to be bigger than that deal?  I think that I'll be proud.  It is.  You guys are going to be.  Unless.  Puffing cigars.  No, I told you.  I think there's going to be a whole lot of.  Patrice O'Neal, I'm the head of Exxon.  Hello, how are you? 
[02:16:30]  It's going to be a whole lot of quiet and a whole lot of crying when that motherfucker.  Yeah, but what does that do?  Motherfuckers going to stop shooting each other?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Just fucking made me.  I mean, I just want to.  It's just something that you just go, fuck, man.  This month.  He is the boss.  Even though it's not going to change shit.  I'm not going to be able to walk down and say, hey, white woman, take your clothes off.  You need hope.  Because it's the black president.  Patrice needs so much. 
[02:17:00]  You needed something to hope for.  It's not external hope.  You need hope.  It's not.  That's a white trick.  I'm not going to let you do it.  Patrice, I don't believe, honestly, I believe, I'll be proud of him because he's a black  man who's been able to accomplish.  I was proud of Condoleezza Rice.  Let me say it.  Fuck him, though.  Fuck him.  I don't give a fuck about him.  Every black man that does something great, I can be proud of everyone that does it.  He don't care if it's Nipsey fucking Russell.  Fuck him, man.  Geraldine was the first lady.  I don't go. 
[02:17:30]  DL, I'm going to quit you 100% on what you're saying, except for this one block between what  you're saying and what I'm saying, is that I want the symbol part means something to me,  man.  Because it's going to mean something to the country.  It's going to make white people feel a certain way, no matter.  Just because I'm black, I'm going to feel this certain kind of thing.  And just because white people are white and they have this funky fear of, oh, shit, here  it comes, white slaves. 
[02:18:00]  It's going to fucking make me feel good to see the fucking fictional change.  All right.  That doesn't make me feel like I just.  It doesn't make me.  It just wants like spite.  It's not fucking spite, no.  When COVID scores 50 points, I don't go, wow, black man did it, so by virtue I didn't.  I go, that's the cool thing.  Well, you would have did it in 1901 if Kobe was the only nigga player.  I would have done this.  I can make it. 
[02:18:30]  They compartmentalize for me.  I'm very proud that a black man has the possibility of ascending to a place where I had no concept  that it could possibly.  I'm with you.  He was the most shocked.  When he won Iowa, he was the most shocked motherfucker on stage.  I was.  I won.  I was about to go home and make my vice presidential bumper sticker.  I'm proud of that, but I also, but the other part of my mind goes, but this is just a dude  who, who, who.  It's frankly made everybody else believe he is very, it's very much. 
[02:19:00]  That's all.  Like the OJ verdict.  That's what it is.  Right.  What it is, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's not that we gave a fuck.  I'm going to put it in.  I'll speak for me.  It's not that I gave a fuck whether OJ did it or not.  He beat the game that was made up by the people that made up the game and he, and he fucking  got off when that's what was happening all these years.  That's how slow it was for me.  But I feel like he did it. 
[02:19:30]  He's about to be the fucking president.  He said, he's about to be the president with the fucking game that you created.  And when I say you, um, you know, I meant to say, I meant to say you people, he's playing  the game that he's supposed to play.  Yeah, but I respect it.  And I just want to see it happen.  I like that he, I like that he beat the game.  And they hate this motherfucker.  I like that he did.  They be giving Hillary, they was giving Hillary shit.  But it's crazy nigga preaching. 
[02:20:00]  But she's too dumb.  But she hates Obama.  He gets great coverage.  People love, they hate Hillary.  Yeah.  They love Barack Obama.  The media was feeding a lot of stuff.  You can't say that.  No, not at all.  Jeremiah, are you serious?  Sound bites like that?  Just to help her out?  No, sound bites like that?  Hey, Hillary, the nigga can't bowl now.  They just liked both of them beating back in heads together.  Sound bites like that, they couldn't resist.  No matter what you think, this is the truth.  If enough white people don't vote for him, he ain't going to be president.  So if there is that animus, if that animus, so they got to buy into what you're saying. 
[02:20:30]  I don't care if it's white guilt.  I don't care if it's people believing them.  So we got to start killing white folks.  They have to.  He won Iowa, he won Vermont.  He's in a hotbed.  They have to give him, they have to say, we believe, for whatever reason you have to do it.  I think, for me, I'm going to be proud of a black man, like I said, doing something like that.  But I just don't have, and I can't do it.  Anything that white people do when it comes to Obama, whether it's vote for him or vote against him, I'm questioning it. 
[02:21:00]  Until he's president, and it's all over, and I can go, there was one, and now I can listen to a white president that goes, I'm going to vote for him because I think he's the best.  And then I'll just go, God, fuck you, you white guilt motherfucker.  I have no regard for what white people say in terms of the president right now, the black president.  Bush fucked up so bad that that's the reason so many white people will vote for Obama is because Bush fucked up so bad. 
[02:21:30]  That's right.  They turned their back on the party, on anyone that looks like Bush, anyone that acts like Bush.  That's it.  25% but you're 25%.  I'm talking to 25% right now.  He is big enough to be 25%.  And I'm talking to a quarter of motherfuckers.  All that shit you're talking, you think that he's thinking all that shit?  No, there are some staunch party liners that ain't going to fucking vote anything close to a liberal.  I wouldn't vote anything close to a liberal.  I fucking like my guns.  Am I a liberal?  Love my guns. 
[02:22:00]  No, you're more independent than anybody.  So I can have a gun and a hooker and we.  Right.  Then I'll vote for that motherfucker.  If I can have, I just love.  If you have a gun, you don't need a hooker.  Yeah, you do.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, swimwalk.  Swimwalk, come on.  I want to go back to Stalker Patty because he's going to vote for Obama.  I want to know, Stalker Patty, what does Obama believe in?  You're actually voting.  What do you like about Obama? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, what's his platform that you wear?  That he wears platform.  That he wears platform.  That's what we're going to say.  Dressed for the inauguration like fucking Huggy Bear.  His platform, he wears platform.  What is it about?  Because you've said many times that you have a lot of racial animosity against black people.  What is it about?  It's okay.  You've said that many times.  What is it about Obama that you like politically?  Yeah.  Politically?  Mm-hmm.  Well, he seems like he's more flexible.  I think he's going to be able to do the job.  That was very, very specific.  Wow. 
[02:23:00]  Flexible.  That's good.  That's pretty, yes.  He practices yoga.  And stuff like that.  If you ask the average American why they're voting for somebody, you would get answers.  Yes.  Patrice is right.  That's exactly what Patrice says.  But also black people, same thing.  Yeah.  Anyone who's voting, this is the type of answer.  Well, you know she has no...  No one really knows what these people stand for.  Thank God for the fucking...  That's why I'll say what I'll say.  They fucking bother.  They bullshit and they get a job.  That's why I can't be bothered.  I don't give a shit.  He's looking at her.  I don't give a shit.  She said, and stuff like that.  Never the sign of a fucking smart... 
[02:23:30]  Thank God for the electoral college.  That's why.  Because motherfuckers like her, they didn't trust motherfuckers like her.  Well, Patty, I don't want to tell you.  You're not going to vote for Obama.  But there's nobody else that's strong enough.  No.  What's that?  You're not going to vote for McCain.  He seems to me like he could handle the pressure.  And McCain is not strong.  I don't want to.  I'd rather lean right than left.  There's a great discussion going on both places, unfortunately.  Patty is saying that she thinks that you think McCain is not as strong as Obama.  No, what did you say, Patty?  Because we were talking over you.  Seriously, back up.  You think he could handle the pressure? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, I think he can.  And Jimmy goes, and McCain can?  After what he's been through in the war?  Yeah, he was upside down by his shoulders for five years by many tiny genitals.  He's also over...  He's like 72 years old and has all these health issues and everything.  He might stop in the middle of the four years and have the vice president take over.  I don't know if he's going to be healthy enough.  It would be a horrible thing that...  But anytime you're...  If your birthday got 19-0 anything, you shouldn't be a president. 
[02:24:30]  19-0.  So you're not going to vote for...  You would never vote for Obama.  No.  And you know something?  And I'd be honest.  Like Patrice doesn't think I'd be.  I don't like his politics.  I don't like that he's too...  He's too fucking liberal for me.  And I don't...  See, and I don't like...  I don't like McCain.  Yeah.  I don't like McCain either.  He's too...  He's a little too far right-lander.  But I would never vote for somebody I didn't like.  So who's left?  That's what I'm saying.  You...  You...  Fucking left.  I'd love to vote for somebody.  When I see the point he's getting ready to make...  You're taking the point.  You're going to vote just because you have to vote for that dude. 
[02:25:00]  For the point...  I would never...  If...  If...  If...  If...  If I don't like politicians, but I like enough of what Obama says that I can vote for him,  I would never vote for somebody I didn't like.  He's...  But he's making sure that...  I wouldn't do it.  Obama is the more of two evils for Anthony.  He's making sure by his vote going against Obama...  I'm picking the lesser of the two evils.  He just makes sure that he's going to help Obama not be president as opposed to helping  McCain be the president. 
[02:25:30]  He's just trying to make sure Obama is in my mind.  He said the same thing you're saying, though.  Basically, you're saying you're voting the black party.  I'm just voting for the white guy.  I'm just voting for the white guy.  Hold on.  I'm saying if I didn't believe enough in him, I wouldn't do it.  More importantly, I've got to ask.  How nervous are you getting, Anthony?  Because D.L. is getting closer and closer to you.  Oh, and I'm moving over this way.  D.L. Hughley.  Oh, you vote for Obama, motherfucker.  That's right.  Just like your neighborhood in January. 
[02:26:00]  It's a visual, but D.L. Hughley started his appearance way the fuck over here.  Creeping over.  And you know, and we...  Anthony's always behind the equipment at this point.  And we believe almost the same thing.  Like, you, you, but you, you, you believe, I mean, literally, you believe, I believe a  man should have a right to carry guns.  I believe that he should, the woman should have an, have the right to have an abortion.  I don't believe that the government is, I believe government's too big.  I don't believe that they should be the end all.  I think that they should be less out of, they should be out of business's business and 
[02:26:30]  less in our business.  I think that, uh, uh, I just...  We're more libertarian than either Democrat or Republican.  But I would never vote for a dude, like Patrice was saying, I couldn't, if I didn't like  Obama enough, I couldn't do it.  I think he's a politician.  I think they're all full of shit.  I don't put him up on a shelf and go, ooh, I'm going to worship and a glow comes by.  I don't do all this shit.  I go, he's a, he's a tool.  He's a functional dude who's supposed to do a job.  If I vote for him, because I think he's capable of doing the job.  Yeah.  You are saying you're voting the party line. 
[02:27:00]  Uh, no, I'm voting, I'm voting for McCain because more of his ideas, uh, that he has  are more...  Okay, that's fair.  He has more than Obama has.  I have more in common with what he believes in than Obama believes in.  You have more in common with Obama than him?  No, no.  Because I have literally nothing in common with Obama.  I mean, ideology as far as the politics goes, which is probably a bunch of bullshit anyway.  They just say the shit to get into office, but...  Well, I have a black wife and three black kids, so, well, he has two.  Yeah, so that's not what in common you have. 
[02:27:30]  I've never been tortured, so I guess I don't have much...  Not even today, huh?  Sure you have.  You were married for nine years.  Okay, that's true.  Hey, some good instant feedback coming in.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky writes, I thought today was Friday the 13th, not Black Friday.  I told you.  I told you.  And then Rich B. from Iowa, he goes, Opie, you saved a man's life yesterday.  You had time to run down Iowa and save 40 Boy Scouts' lives by performing first aid.  Then still had time to come back and solve race relations and set the Obama presidency. 
[02:28:00]  Does Anthony and Jimmy do anything?  Well, I'm booked for handing in combs after my viewpoints from today.  Oh, really?  Yes, I got that going for me.  All right.  Well.  Have fun on that.  Talk to combs.  Good old combs.  Does he talk?  Does he get to say two fucking words on that show?  Yeah, really?  And I like combs, but that's the weirdest.  Is he a burn victim or something? 
[02:28:30]  What the fuck's going on?  What the fuck happened to him?  I'm like, it's like a muffin.  Like somebody got their hands.  He's like, and I like him.  He looks like a burned Billie Jean King.  What the fuck happened to you?  Oh, the poor God.  And he's a nice guy, but you go, are you animated?  Like that Gary Bauer, that conservative dude?  That motherfucker looks like he just broke off loaded in the ring.  Don't he? 
[02:29:00]  I'm like, God.  And he can't even talk enough to ride another six flag, so he can't be my leader.  That is Hannity's show all the way.  He just needs a whipping boy.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neil, and to find out any dates, any information, anything you need  to know about me, go to PatriceO'Neil.com or visit me at MySpace slash Tourist in Brazil.  I don't know why I did that.  I'm not that corny.  Somebody had stole my original MySpace, and that's what he put, like, because that's how  he's, you know, he knew me from Brazil. 
[02:29:30]  But that's my shit.  You can't even change it now, because by the time I got it, it was already 8,000 friends.  This nigga had more friends than I got now.  Like, I haven't even doubled the friends that this fucking imposter did.  So if you go to MySpace.com slash Tourist in Brazil, you can get some information on Patrice  O'Neil.  And if you go to PatriceO'Neil.com, it'll tell you all the lovely little places I'll be.  Obi and Anthony.  Hey, it's Nick DiFallo, and this is the worst of Louis C.K., another redheaded fucking fag 
[02:30:00]  from Boston.  What am I reading?  The redheaded fucking fag list from Boston?  Hey, I have one quick story about Rome, by the way, because this guy mentioned the  Cabinieri, the state police there.  Yeah.  I was in Rome once.  I went to Russia and Rome by myself, just pathetically.  Spoke to no people for two weeks.  Made no connections with anybody.  But that sounds so exciting.  It was interesting.  I saw some cool shit.  After a few days, were you going like, what the fuck am I doing?  Yeah.  I'm in hotels. 
[02:30:30]  I could be in a hotel in fucking Newton, Massachusetts.  In Phoenix or something.  So I'm in a car that I rented in Rome.  And I'm looking at beautiful countryside.  These are postcards out my window.  I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  And I'm driving down a highway near Rome through the countryside.  And I'm like, I'm going crazy.  I haven't talked to anybody.  And there's a roadblock of Cabinieri, state police.  And they look like Nazis.  They have high hats and boots up to their knees.  And they have a rent or whatever stop signs.  They have a roadblock.  They're stopping traffic.  And I just have this weird idea in my head. 
[02:31:00]  Nothing's happened to me.  And I'm just, I don't care what happens to me now.  And I gunned it.  And I went around them a little into opposite traffic.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I floored it.  Went around a guy.  And then I looked at my rearview mirror.  And they're running like it's the Pink Panther or something.  Like shaking their fists.  And I'm like, fuck it.  Get in your cars.  Chase me.  Put me in jail.  I'd actually happily be in an Italian jail.  Meet some Italian people.  He's insane.  Because I hadn't had like the guts to say hello to anybody. 
[02:31:30]  That is great.  So what happened?  Nothing fucking happened.  They shook their little fists.  It's like you're doing movies.  They got small in the mirror.  And I went on.  And nobody did anything.  That's fantastic.  It's like a little bit of excitement.  If you got caught, you'd have to interact with people.  I'd be at some sergeant's desk who'd be typing my name.  And they'd call somebody at home.  All smoking cigarettes that weird European way.  Yeah.  With their thumb and forefinger.  Well, like when you see like OJ Simpson. 
[02:32:00]  There was nobody even charged.  He didn't even get charged for taking the police on a high speed chase.  No.  There's no.  No.  And when you watch cops, when they get a guy.  Well, he did a little, you know, did, you know, he got a fine for the chase.  Nobody cares.  Jesus.  What would have happened?  I would have spent one night in jail and paid a fine and met and had a really interesting experience.  Yeah, interesting jail.  You don't know what Italian jails are like.  Big unclipped cock going into your ass.  They're not going to fucking hang me for dodging a fucking.  Yeah.  They find out I'm not a criminal. 
[02:32:30]  I'm just some asshole.  American comedian dies in hail of bullets.  Because he didn't pay attention to a stop sign.  Hey, back to the gaming thing.  A couple of instant feedbacks.  Use lad bag.  Confession time.  I was a little fag who played Dungeons and Dragons when I was a kid.  And people used to say it leads to devil worship and violence.  The truth, update.  The truth, we were just douches.  And then Pat from Foxborough.  I play Madden 07 all the time, but I don't play for the Patriots. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, see?  There's two hacky comedian bits out there right now.  I'm on the road a lot now watching middle acts.  Great.  One of them is teachers molesting their students.  This didn't happen when I was a kid.  That hog.  I do that.  And then the other one is a video game.  I played Frogger and I don't walk out into traffic.  And get hit by a car.  I do that one.  Let's take a break.  This is Louis C.K.  And if you're interested in where I'm playing live, go to LouisCK.com. 
[02:33:30]  If you're not interested in where I'm playing live, just shit in a hat and put it on.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We don't know what the f*** we're doing.  All right.  We got finger 11 in the studio.  Is that mic?  Did you try the mic?  Are we set up or?  It's supposed to be working.  Can you hear me at all?  A little bit. 
[02:34:00]  Can you hear me only a little bit?  Yeah.  You're picking up on the other mics, I think.  That doesn't sound good at all.  Is there a way he can get him a different mic?  That doesn't sound right.  Any of them work?  Does anything work?  Play a guitar or something.  Does that one work?  Just hit the.  That's sort of hearing that a little bit.  That's coming.  That one.  Shut your mics up for one second and see if you hear these mics at all.  All right.  Just the radio show.  All right.  Go.  One, two, three.  I knew this would happen.  We didn't expect this to work.  Oh, my God. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  And this is not embarrassing at all to have like a really big band in looking at us like  we're just douches.  But it was working.  What the hell?  Opie and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian Andrew Dice Clay.  Jay Moore, what's up?  Gentlemen, how are you?  There he is.  I'm a little distracted right now because I called last break and it was about a seven  minute break.  And then my wife and I made some bacon and she's actually standing on her head right 
[02:35:00]  now.  Oh, trying to get the pregnant thing going.  Oh, God.  It's impossible to get your wife pregnant.  It's impossible.  Every other girl you bang on the road.  They get pregnant in two seconds and you got to bury them in the woods someplace.  Oh, God.  A la Norton.  Hey, wow.  Well, why wasn't that line on Conan O'Brien last night?  Yeah, why as well then?  I think that line would have killed on Conan last night.  What do you think, Jay?  Well, you know what?  Hindsight is always 20-20, isn't it, gentlemen?  And Dice?  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  What's up?  Well, there goes that story.  Yeah, there goes that story.  And there goes you.  That's what I figured.  What was that about, creep?  Uh-oh.  What's wrong, Dice?  He knows what I'm calling about.  What?  What was that about?  Don't be stupid.  Let me finish your story, Dice.  Don't tell me what you're going to finish.  I'm going to finish you.  I want to know what he said.  Why'd you put him on the line, stupid?  I had to wait on hold.  All right, hold on.  Like I put him on.  All right, hold on.  Let me...  Like I push the buttons, Jay Moore.  All right, Jay, go ahead. 
[02:36:00]  Finish your story.  Oh, that's going to make him twice as mad, too.  Finish the story.  Great.  Hold on, Dice.  Yeah.  What's wrong?  You know what's wrong, and he knows what's wrong.  What?  What?  What happened?  What was that about last night?  On Conan O'Brien?  What's that?  Jay, he's a good friend of the Opie and Anthony show.  I know what he is.  And to show his love, he used one of our terms, yambeg.  I think it was an homage.  It was an homage to the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course, everyone knows that we came up with the term yambeg. 
[02:36:30]  No, no.  I'm not going to slide.  You know why I let you guys slide?  Why?  Because you promote my shows.  I got no reason to let him slide.  Uh-oh.  But...  What are you playing?  I'll tell everyone I see today.  But he didn't steal the line, man.  Yeah, he stole the line, and he knows he stole it, and he knew he was going to use it.  He didn't steal the line.  Oh, man.  You know you're out of the show business.  That's a creepy move, Jay.  I don't go for that stuff.  You know when you're out of the show business, Luke, and you've got to call radio shows to say you stole my line?  That whole stupid bit about the sperm banks that I got on album number two already. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, boy.  And then you're using my newer lines because you had nothing to say.  What was that about?  What newer lines?  And you come to the store like a real jerk-off and go, oh, are you going on?  I want to watch it.  I didn't know you wanted to record and use the stuff.  First of all, I go on before you out of respect.  Yeah, you go on before me because I let you go on if I'm not going to be able to talk.  Jay Moore shows up at the comedy store.  I want to go on.  I'm not going to be able to talk.  Who is he? 
[02:37:30]  You know?  I go, he's the guy that plays Gilligan in most movies.  What the hell is that?  Jay Moore.  I don't go for that, Jay.  I still don't know what you're talking about.  You know what I'm talking about.  Well, why don't you tell me what you're talking about?  Don't play the tough guy routine with me.  I'm not going to talk unless I have a chance.  All right, all right.  I'll let you talk because you don't.  Because you can't control yourself because you need freaking medication.  You can't control yourself to not talk.  First of all, I go on in front of you at the comedy store.  I know why you go on in front of me. 
[02:38:00]  You can't help yourself.  You are so hungry for fame because you're so far out of the loop that this is the only chance you get to tap dance for America.  Please, Jay, you know, you come to the store, you're an ass kisser.  Oh, yeah.  Don't tell me my chance for fame like people know who you are.  Please.  You're the Gilligan of movies.  What are we talking about here?  That's who you are.  I'd rather be a Gilligan in movies.  You know what, you know what, it's good that you'd rather be a Gilligan because I would never settle for being a Gilligan. 
[02:38:30]  I could work circles around you.  I knew you were a creep when you booked the Bad Boys show and then canceled out Rascals and just were going for the Westbury gig so you could then continue with the Caroline's gig.  What?  I knew you were a creep then.  I knew you were a creep coming to the comedy store trying to pick up on any chick coming out of the bathroom.  I knew you were a creep then.  I'd love to explain to you guys what he's talking about.  All right.  Don't be a big shot with me.  Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice, I want to hear what Jay has to say about that. 
[02:39:00]  No, he went on.  He knows he's wrong.  You're not letting Jay talk.  You're not letting Jay talk.  Dice, you're not letting Jay talk.  No, wait a minute.  They're not letting Jay talk.  Oh, Christ.  This guy, let me tell you something.  He's got a friend out in L.A.  He's a terrific comic, Ralph May.  Okay?  So he throws Jay a birthday party and invites me to it.  And I showed up, not for Jay, because Ralph was nice enough to invite me. 
[02:39:30]  Okay?  Jay doesn't even show up for his birthday party from his best friend.  They tell me he's got a big studio meeting, but yet his manager was there.  His agents were there.  All of a sudden, studio meetings are being done without the star's representatives there.  He's a frigging creep, this guy.  Did you just call me a star?  Yeah, you're Gilligan.  Gilligan was a star in his own right.  Now let Jay talk.  No, he did the wrong thing, and he won't cop to it. 
[02:40:00]  And he thinks he's going to be a big shot.  But when he comes toe-to-toe with me, he's going to crumble, and he knows it.  Well, he sees me.  We'll see what a big shot he is then.  The birthday party that was thrown for me.  Yeah, you know about the birthday party.  Oh, Christ.  You got about your friend Ralph May.  Put Dice on hold.  You got about how you snubbed him and didn't show up to your own brother.  All right, Dice, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Because I can't.  Jay can't.  I can't take him.  Jay can't talk.  He's so ridiculous, and he's so retarded.  Ralphie May told me, I'm having a barbecue.  He said, why don't you come on down, I'm having a barbecue. 
[02:40:30]  On his own, he started to tell everybody it was a birthday party for me.  He called Dice and invited him.  I have had conversations with Ralph.  It's Ralphie, not Ralph, by the way.  Ralphie May, since then, it wasn't a birthday party.  He just said that to get people to go.  He was the dummy, not me.  Second of all, the Westbury Music Fair, I was honored to work with Dice at Westbury Music Fair  to open for Dice out of a show of respect.  What was last night a show of respect? 
[02:41:00]  Why'd you cancel Rascals last night?  Was that a show of respect?  I was just about to say it, you Jew.  You're an opportunist.  You're a jerk-off guy.  You're a heathen.  That's what you are.  Yo, they're both Jewish, right?  No.  No, they're not both Jewish.  What are you calling me now?  Stop.  What are you calling me?  You guys, I was just about to tell you what happened with Westbury, but I couldn't get it.  I know.  What happened with Westbury?  What happened?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What happened at Westbury?  Westbury Music Fair I agreed to do with Dice.  Right.  For Dice. 
[02:41:30]  Not for the money, because it was less than what I would normally get if I did it.  He says, I also want you to do Rascals.  I said, definitely on Westbury, no on Rascals.  Because why would I open for you at Rascals when I could sell out 20 shows in a row there by myself?  You guys understand that.  All right, sure.  I'm on the road.  I check my messages.  I get a message from Club Soda Kenny saying, Jay, we need an answer now.  It's all or nothing.  So I say, thanks for making it easy for me.  It's nothing.  Uh-huh.  That's what happened.  Okay. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  You tell me where I'm the big shot here.  Back to Opie.  All right.  Back to Dice.  I heard Jay's explanation of why he didn't do Rascals and Westbury, because he was given  the all or nothing ultimatum.  Yeah, that was what happened last night.  Forget about that.  That's not all or nothing.  No, no, no.  Because you were proven wrong.  What, Jay?  I just proved you wrong.  You didn't prove me wrong.  You're a scumbag.  What are you talking about?  I'm a scumbag.  Look in the mirror.  Look in the mirror.  Look in the mirror.  I get in the coffin.  I get in the coffin.  Die.  You know, Jay, you're going to run into me, and you're not going to be a big shot. 
[02:42:30]  I get in the coffin.  I get in the coffin.  I can promise that to you.  Die, I get in the coffin.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  You just did seal your own.  I'll put it that way.  I'm defending myself.  That's why you're saying die, get in the coffin.  Dice, you got nothing to say.  Dice, he pretty much had an answer for what you were saying.  I just want to know.  He had no answer.  He went on a show.  He did material that's not his.  You know what I mean?  He's a little kiss-ass.  He did your voice, though.  He comes to the comedy store trying to pick up anything coming out of a girl's bathroom. 
[02:43:00]  Better than coming out of a man's room.  I was Gilligan to Tom Cruise in that movie.  Remember?  Jesus Christ.  The problem is that I'm Gilligan now.  You come meet me, Jay, and you talk to me face-to-face like that.  Let's see you be a big shot then.  The store again.  Because I'm telling you, that's where I'll be.  You come meet me now, and you say what you're saying on the radio.  You know what, I want to see that happen.  Well, I can't even get my point across because you're going to screw me.  You have no point. 
[02:43:30]  He just made a couple of good points.  He made a couple of good points.  He didn't make me wrong with anything.  You're a zero.  That's it.  Then why are you calling to call me a zero if I'm just a zero?  Because I'm pissed off when a zero goes on and does my material.  That's why.  When you go on a show and do my material, that's wrong.  And you know it, and you're trying to defend something that you can't defend.  I said this is great.  But if you want to tell me to die and get in the coffin, you come.  You know where I'm at.  I'll be waiting for you.  Believe me.  Now he's going to hang up.  And you're going to have to walk into me. 
[02:44:00]  Believe me.  And that's a problem you don't want in your life.  Because with this energy between us floating around, I would have to confront you to talk to you face-to-face.  You will have to confront me.  Believe me.  And I want to see if you can look at me.  I just agreed with you.  I want to see if you can stand with me with nobody around.  I just agreed with you.  You stand with me with nobody around, and you tell me die and get in the coffin.  And then we're going to see what happens.  And then we're going to see who's in the coffin.  We're going to see what a big shot you are.  You don't scare me.  You ain't nothing to me.  Believe me. 
[02:44:30]  Maybe you could pick on the girl from Regis' show.  You know, pick on that girl.  I want to see you stand with me like a man, which you're not, you know, and tell me what you just said on the radio.  I want to see you do that to me.  I think I hit a sore spot with Dice.  Hey, you didn't hit a sore spot.  Hey, Dice.  You did the wrong thing.  Dice.  You don't cop to it once again.  No, I didn't.  I just agreed with it, and you're not addressing it.  You know what I mean?  Stick to being Gilligan's in film.  Don't get on a comedy stage. 
[02:45:00]  What are you guys jumping in here?  Hey, Dice.  You didn't hear that he said, hey, I'm Dice.  Yeah, I'm big.  What did I say?  You didn't hear him say, yeah, I'm Dice.  Yeah, I'm big.  Like he was doing an impression of you when he then said, yeah, I'm big.  Oh.  Well, maybe I got the wrong idea.  You know what I mean?  Sometimes, I mean, a mistake.  I mean, I didn't even see the thing.  You know, it's my misunderstanding. 
[02:45:30]  Westbury, you...  Hey, Jerry, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean nothing by that.  I'm sorry.  Are you kidding me?  I accept.  We got off to a bad start.  Club Soda Kenny called me and said it's all or nothing.  You know what I mean?  Jerry, you got to accept my apology now.  I did, but you don't listen.  No, I'm sorry.  It's all my mistake.  You know what I mean?  Maybe I got a little out of control.  I lose my head.  I got a bad temper.  You know what I mean?  You know, Joey Breed is coming around.  This one, Tommy Smith, just telling me everything going on. 
[02:46:00]  And, you know, and then you got to say this.  Because I'm over here now.  I wasn't over there when you did the thing.  You know what I'm saying?  Did you hear my explanation about Westbury Music Fair?  You know what?  It's my mistake.  It's my mistake.  I should have had you do that show.  You know what I'm saying?  Why would I open for you at a comedy club that I could headline myself?  Because it was all part of what we were trying to put together.  But that hampers me.  Because then when I was going to go back into the comedy club, they were going to come because 
[02:46:30]  they just saw me with you.  No, but exactly.  It's business.  I know.  When you have a penny call, you say, well, or nothing, you make a decision for me.  You know, I get off the handle.  You know what I mean?  All right.  Listen.  You know, we got to let certain things go in this world.  I didn't know you did the impression.  Let me hear how you did it.  Yambag, now.  It's me.  Hey, scumbag.  That's not even the way I say it. 
[02:47:00]  You didn't do that as me.  You did that as you.  So people took that as your material, and you know damn well that was my material.  Yambag, I said, can I see you in a mountain bow in the 2003s?  We have the tape.  Is that who you are now?  Hold on.  We have the tape.  We have the tape, Dice, if you want to hear it.  I want to hear this.  Here it is.  If both Jay and Dice can be quiet for a second, we'll play this for you.  I'm the problem.  Okay, here we go.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  I'm the problem.  You're everybody now.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here's the tape from Conan.  I heard he was wearing the sparkle jacket. 
[02:47:30]  No, he wasn't.  Here it is.  Here's the tape from Conan.  You guys are great.  I'm wearing a sparkle.  All right.  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right.  Go ahead.  Here we go.  Let's say I have 11 in the entire Yambag.  What did you just say?  What did you just say?  I said, Conan, I said, let's say I have 11.  That's not the part I'm asking about.  Oh, I forgot.  In the entire Yambag.  Now it's mine. 
[02:48:00]  I sound like Dice.  Yambag.  Dice is watching, going like, this is too blue.  There you go.  See that?  He's a Yambag.  No, he didn't even say it right.  You know, if you're going to steal, you've got to do it right.  You didn't do it right.  Right?  Yeah.  The way he said Yambag was very weak.  Too much applause.  Just because I'm on the end, people are listening to the end.  Hold on.  Yambag. 
[02:48:30]  You're both talking at the same time.  What's new?  Yambag.  You shouldn't do it all the time.  That's like saying to a chick, would you like a little dessert?  Maybe a little cream bro-rode?  Now, Dice, you do your Christopher Walken impression, and everyone knows Jay Moore was  pretty much the first person to do the Chris Walken impression.  No, he wasn't.  No?  Peter Dobson did it first.  He got that whole thing going.  Who's that?  I mean, he's an actor that could do Chris Walken. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, you know what?  When I was 20 years old, he does a good Chris Walken.  I don't hang out with a lot of actors.  What's that?  I don't even know who the guy is.  So what?  So you're supposed to know everybody?  You just made my own point for me.  You're suggesting I stole Walken, too?  I don't even know who you're talking about.  Yes, you do.  Luca Polanka does a better walker than you.  Who?  Luca.  He knows who it is.  Who?  Even Ralphie May does a good Walken.  But you don't know him either, right? 
[02:49:30]  No, I don't know who Ralphie May is.  All right.  Well, look, I've got to say, I think Jay does the best Walken I've ever seen.  Well, he didn't do the best jam bag.  I'll give you that.  All right.  I think we can all agree.  Tyce, you do the best jam bag.  That's right.  I do the best jam bag, my friend.  And Jay does the best Walken.  How's that?  Tyce, do a little Walken.  Hey, I'll answer.  All right.  I ask you about are there any girls, and then you say yeah, and then I say the other line.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  You ready?  I've got to stand up.  All right.  All right.  You watching?  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  All right.  Are there any babes?  Yeah.  Then let me in.  You see what I mean?  That's awful.  That's without rehearsing.  But that's awful.  All right.  Listen, we have to end the show, believe it or not.  It does.  Yeah.  Are you going to be on my show at the Beacon?  Jay, you finally got a show off after 25 years.  Good for you.  Hey, Jay.  It doesn't make any sense.  It's a benefit, Jay.  I want to see how many jokes you're going to see of yours. 
[02:50:30]  It's all right, Jay.  I'm going to be waiting for you.  Don't worry.  All right.  We're going to straighten this out, just me and you, with no radio, with nobody watching.  We're going to see the Ralphie May thing.  You see, because I'm not going to forget the call for this, Jay.  You understand?  You're supposed to tell.  I'm not going to forget that.  I want to see you say that to me.  So I'm going to forget about the Ralphie May thing.  I'm going to forget about the Ralphie May thing.  All right.  We'll fade them out.  It's the worst of the O.B. and Anthony show.  Anthony, we've got to get into the Dice Moore fight.  This probably. 
[02:51:00]  I didn't eat dinner last night.  I didn't get to work out last night.  I didn't get to watch TV.  Nothing.  Because I was dealing with the Dice Moore fight all the way up until 2.30 in the morning  when Dice called me after the detectives talked to him.  Now, I've got to tell you something.  This thing is escalating.  It started quickly.  Jay Moore was on Conan O'Brien a couple of nights ago. 
[02:51:30]  He used the term yambag.  Now, if you listen to this show, Dice came to this show a while back and used the term yambag.  We've adopted it.  We love it.  It's funny.  Everyone that's on this show uses the term yambag when you're describing the scrote.  Because in some context, we can't use the scrote.  So we use yambag.  Describes what you're talking about.  So Jay used it on Conan.  Conan questioned it like, what?  And Jay starts going, yambag. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, like Dice.  And going, now it's mine.  Now it's mine, he says.  In the Dice voice.  Dice calls up yesterday when Jay's on the phone.  Just pissed off as all hell.  Yelling at Jay for ripping him off.  Ripping off yambag.  And then he just starts going into other things that they argued about.  Club appearances and whatnot.  Birthday parties.  It got ridiculous.  When you think that the situation this country is in right now, that Dice is pissed off at 
[02:52:30]  the use of yambag, I'm astounded.  Well, yeah.  This whole fight started because of one word, yambag.  What, yambag?  This is the great yambag war.  Yeah.  This is the yambag fight that you're about to hear.  So, yeah.  Quickly, after the show, I talked to Dice for well over an hour on the way home.  Yeah.  As soon as I got home, the phone was ringing.  And now I'm talking to Jay.  Jay tells me he called the cops on Dice.  This is all dead serious, man.  The police were called.  Jay is claiming, and I got to be careful with my words, that Dice... 
[02:53:00]  He's alleging.  That Dice said that he would blow him up into little pieces, which wouldn't be the coolest  thing to say under the current circumstances, obviously.  Blow him up into little pieces?  So now Dice is...  You know, Jay's claiming...  I'm a terrorist!  Yeah, Jay's claiming that Dice is a terrorist.  Oh!  Dice, in turn, is really pissed off because Jay told him...  to die and get in a coffin.  Osama Diceladen!  Also, he's really pissed off that Jay was using the word Jew and heave. 
[02:53:30]  He was saying...  Yeah, yeah.  Because Jay was on yesterday with Dice on the phone.  Jay kept...  Dice was interrupting Jay.  Time and time again.  So Jay finally turns around and just goes,  Hey, why don't you admit you're a Jew?  I don't know where that came from.  But, you know, Jay felt he had to throw that into the mix.  Maybe to try to shut Dice up.  I don't know.  You know, there was a little chuckle, though, because I'm talking to Dice well into the night. 
[02:54:00]  No exaggeration.  Yeah.  And he would have talked another two hours, but he got a beep, and the beep was a detective  calling Dice to get his side of the story.  Right.  I'm dead serious, man.  This is no radio bit.  But while I'm talking to Dice, I'm flipping around the TV.  Yeah.  And there is the true Hollywood story with Andrew Silverstein.  Yeah, I saw that last night, too.  I saw pieces of that.  So I'm laughing.  I'm like, man, you're on the TV.  I'm talking to you on the phone.  What sort of TV show?  And then I go, Dice, why did you allow them to film you right after you woke up one morning? 
[02:54:30]  You know the one interview where he's there with his wife?  He's all puffy and sleepy, and his hair's all like...  Yeah, it's so obvious he either just woke up or he's on her way.  So I go, Dice, why would you allow a film crew to come into your house when you first  wake up?  Because this is going to be on TV for the next 10 years.  And at the time when that first aired, we didn't have the relationship with Dice where  we got the pleasure of meeting him and stuff. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  So my first thought was, oh my God, what happened to Dice?  What happened to Dice?  I'm on the smack.  Yeah, now he's just, yeah, he's in bad shape.  But then we get to meet him, and it's obvious that he's fine.  Right.  And he goes, no, but I think everybody assumes that I just woke up.  I'm like, I don't think so.  I think people are thinking, what the hell is wrong with Dice in that shot?  He did.  He looked like he just woke up.  His eyes are all puffy.  He's all puffy.  Well, put yourself out there.  Yeah, he doesn't really, you know, he's not really talking much. 
[02:55:30]  He's a little disoriented.  So it was quite a night, Anthony.  I was bedazzling my jacket all night.  Like, I was up late with the studs.  Then I'm out cold, and the phone rings at 2.30 in the morning, and it's Dice.  He's like, why are you sleeping?  I'm like, Dice, I'm not in L.A., man.  It's 2.30 in the morning.  What are you doing?  No, I look at the clock.  Right.  It's like 11.30.  Which means I was asleep for at least, I don't know, three hours at this point.  What's the matter with you?  So that's where we're at. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  There's all sorts of threats going on.  My favorite out of yesterday, not even the yambag stuff, not the stuff of why Jay didn't  do the Westbury Music Fair show with Dice.  Well, Dice explained that.  He was trying to build something cool.  Right.  But he needed Jay to do the Rascals shows with him, which is a smaller club, and a great  club down there in Jersey.  And then they were going to bring it to Westbury. 
[02:56:30]  And then after that, they were hoping to bring it to some of these arenas.  I don't know.  Jay's explanation seemed okay to me.  He goes in and does Rascals himself.  Now you're taking sides.  I'm not taking sides.  I just listen to Jay's arguments on everything.  And my favorite one, like I was saying, is the birthday party.  I went to your birthday party.  You're a creep.  You didn't even show up.  And then Jay, explain that.  Oh, by the way, that guy who threw the birthday party, he's calling in today as well. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, is he calling in today?  Dude, I got the whole birthday party controversy over with.  You didn't even show up at your own birthday party.  I have a feeling this is just the beginning, my friend, of a very long day.  TJ, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  What's up?  Hey, you know, generally I'm a fan of both Dice and Jay.  Who isn't?  I am.  But, you know, if Jay really called the police on Dice last night, he's a little bitch. 
[02:57:30]  Well, Jay was a little scared.  Scared for his safety.  Come on.  People talk ass.  You know, and Dice talks ass with the best of them.  You know, calling the police was outrageous.  Quite frankly, I think the whole argument is silly.  I think this entire argument is ridiculous in the light of what is going on in this country  in this day and age.  That yam bag started this whole thing rolling.  And there were other things that were said that, you know, each of them was jabbing the 
[02:58:00]  other one a little more, getting them a little more pissed off, and it escalated.  Right.  So, okay, so do you think that calling the police was warranted?  Well, probably not.  I don't think Dice, yeah.  I don't think Dice was really going to blow Jay to bits.  I really don't think so.  And he supposedly said that to Jay's wife after the show.  Right.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So she's very upset.  It's a mess.  There's detectives involved.  And, you know, someone from one of the camps begged us not to talk about the detectives, 
[02:58:30]  but I'm like, look, man, you got us in the middle of it.  Yeah.  You wasted my night calling me over and over again.  So what am I going to do, not say a word on the air?  I'm learning how to fly a plane.  Where's Jay's house?  Oh!  Bop!  Anthony, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, I called a long time ago when...  Hello?  Yeah, yeah.  I called a long time ago when you guys called the cops on that guy driving the truck,  and I had to yell at Opie.  But if Jay Moore did that, he's a faggot. 
[02:59:00]  Well, we'll get Jay's side of his own.  We'll get his side, because he sounded pretty serious when he was talking to me last night.  You know, he's way funnier than Dice, you know?  I mean, even though he is the Luis Soho of show business, my man does everything.  It's just...  I thought he was the Gilligan of stuff.  He's the Gilligan of show business.  All right, Anthony, thank you.  That's pretty funny, though.  The guy, no one knows him.  He's Gilligan. 
[02:59:30]  Bop!  Bop!  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, it's this Tony.  How are you, bro?  Dude, we love Dice, man.  He's a butt.  Let's call it like it is.  He's lost his effing mind.  Did you hear him yesterday?  Oh, maybe it's me.  Later on, he snaps at the drop of a dime.  He's nuts.  Yeah, he is nuts.  I love him, though.  And we hear, dude, on our end, it's hysterical.  He's going to be in a padded room suit on Ford Fairlane. 
[03:00:00]  Oh!  You know, I should give you guys another part of this, too.  On the way home, I asked Dice at least ten times, and I asked Jay at least four times.  I said, if you guys are playing us in any shape or form, you need to tell me now, because  now we're putting ourselves out there, and we're going to sound really stupid if this  is all a gag.  And Dice swears it's not.  Jay swears it's not.  Yeah, because if we're being played, they will not be able to use this venue to plug any shows.  And believe me, this show puts a lot of asses in seats. 
[03:00:30]  Well, we don't mind being played, but when it gets really serious, you need to tell us.  And that's what I told Dice, and he's sworn his kids.  Oh, he did?  And I know how close he is with his family, man.  So I truly believe this is as real as it gets.  Yam bag butt!  And that's where we're at today.  Detectives were called.  I know there was some chuckling in there, but then it got serious again, and Jay felt threatened, 
[03:01:00]  so he called the cops.  Detectives went to his place, and then the detectives called Dice to get his side of the  story, and Dice still wants to kick the crap out of Jay if he ever sees him.  And Jay figures, well, I've got to defend myself, so when I see him, I guess I've got to take  him out.  And that's where we're at today.  Paul, what's up?  I hope they're not setting you up.  No, no, because, no, they're definitely not setting us up on this one.  Yeah, I would hate to think so.  Remember Paul Bond from Airsick coming in? 
[03:01:30]  Chocolate starfish, Jay!  Chocolate starfish!  You stole it, Jay!  And then Opie punched him in the face.  Yeah, I don't feel like punching Dice in the face.  Why you want to go and punch me?  Right.  Okay, now there's a problem.  Hey, Jay really called the cops?  Yeah, that's what we're hearing.  Faggot.  What a faggot.  Well, he said that he was going to blow him up to bits, allegedly.  Allegedly.  You can ask Jay when he comes in a little later on the show.  Yeah, I want to hear this. 
[03:02:00]  All right, douches.  All right, bye.  All right, douches.  And really fast.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Dice is all pissed off at Jay Moore for stealing yambag.  I heard Hanson wants to kick Dice's ass for stealing mbop.  No, it's bop, mbop.  Hey, yeah.  All right, Kevin, thank you.  All right.  So there you have it.  We'll see what happens today, okay?  Um-bop, um-bop, um-bop, um-bop.  M-bip, um-bop. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  Um-bop, um-bop.  Hello again, hello.  Just called to say, um-bop.  Yeah, um-bop.  You're gonna do all the baby's life when you turn your back, cause I'm gone so faggot.  Yambag.  Oh, yeah.  Yambag.  You're gone so faggot. 
[03:03:00]  Bring it on home, you rip-off little faggot.  Um-bop.  Hey, the kids don't sing.  What's the matter?  The little blonde one's ripping me off.  I play the drums, too.  I am back.  Oh!  Sing it, faggot.  Um-bop.  Um-bop.  Um-bop. 
[03:03:30]  Um-bop.  They're ripping me off.  All right, we have to take a break, eh?  Let's take a break.  How you doing?  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  I got a lot of personality.  I mean, you got to get a kid to get a personal.  Try that one, Anthony.  You're listening to Anthony and Opie.  Opie and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian Jay Moore.  Hey, Dice.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Is everyone mellow today?  We're having fun, Dice. 
[03:04:00]  Can we work this out today?  Hello?  What's that work out?  Well, you're on the phone.  Jay's in the studio.  Yeah, what's he doing there?  He's hanging out.  We're having fun.  Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here.  What was the problem?  I don't think there was a problem yesterday.  I think, uh...  You know, the big thing was made out of nothing.  What do you mean a big thing?  I got everybody but the SWAT team surrounded my house.  Now stop it.  What are you talking about?  This guy went to detectives, to private investigators. 
[03:04:30]  All kinds of stuff is going on here.  Private investigators.  You know, I'm like, uh, I'm in the dungeon now.  You're in the dungeon?  Yeah, I'm hanging.  You're in the fruit cellar?  Yeah.  I told them they ain't taking me alive.  What?  I see.  What's up with that?  Were any authorities called, Jay?  Were any authorities called?  Yeah, the authorities were called.  By the way, I do owe them a shout-out to the 10th Precinct in New York. 
[03:05:00]  We had a couple laughs last night.  Those guys are the best.  You know, and, um, you know, and they know, uh, you know, me and Jay are having a problem,  but, you know, the detective I talked to thought it was a little more important to go to the disaster site  and try to help out there than worry about a fight we're having on the radio.  Uh-huh.  You know, but, uh, you know, Jay was very nervous that I was going to beat him up.  And, uh, and so I got to apologize to him. 
[03:05:30]  Well, I'm not sure the listeners would believe that I was afraid you were going to beat me up.  Well, that's what it was, or else you went to run to the police.  But that's okay.  I'm not going to beat you up.  Can I put him on hold to tell you what happened?  It's usually the only way to get through, yeah.  All right, hold on, Dice.  You know what I mean?  Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice.  I got everybody in his family calling me, you know, uh.  All right, wait, Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice.  Please help us out here.  All right.  You just said what you had to say.  Let Jay talk.  It is really uncomfortable in the studio right now.  No, I'm very comfortable. 
[03:06:00]  You should see Jay's eyes right now.  If you were comfortable, you wouldn't run to the police after an argument on the radio.  That's not when I went to the police.  I mean, I've had a lot of fights with comedy.  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, Dice, Dice.  Dice, please help me out.  I'm just trying to make a point.  All right, help me out.  Let Jay, uh, say what he has to say now.  All right.  And then you respond.  I'm cool.  Okay, Jay.  But you've got to be quiet.  Be quiet.  I'm cool.  All right, Jay Moore.  My wife called Andrew to say what's between you and Jay is between you and Jay.  Uh, don't say my husband's hitting on waitresses and stuff because it kind of makes, you know, 
[03:06:30]  we are trying to make a baby.  No, your wife didn't say that.  Don't make me play the tape.  Oh, my God.  Nicole.  That's not what you said.  All right, Nicole's in the studio.  Nicole was very nice.  She said, we're trying to make a baby.  I know you and Jay are having problems.  And I said, well, that's very good for you that you want to have a baby.  But I got two kids that love their father and they don't want to see me in a casket dead  with a nail in it.  Isn't that what you said?  No, I said, I get it off.  Wasn't that your threat? 
[03:07:00]  No, I said, I got it.  He was doing an Arnold George impression.  Now that you went to the detectives, I got to handle things on this side.  Thanks.  You ever see Arnold George?  You can't handle things like a man.  He's going to beat me up that tummy.  I can assure everyone listening that the reason the police were involved had nothing  to do with the threat.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  You know what?  You know what?  I'll just go.  Hey, hey, hey.  I'll go home because this is ridiculous.  I'm very serious.  Now we got to put you on hold.  All right, hold on.  Now we got to put you on hold.  See?  See?  Now look what we can do to you. 
[03:07:30]  Okay, go ahead, Jay.  He's on hold.  Exactly what happened was that he was very kind to me when I called and asked him to  please, if you could, just not say that my husband is, you know, hitting on other women.  We're trying to make a baby.  And he was very kind.  He said, I understand and I apologize and I in no way meant to hurt you in any way, shape  or form.  And I really hope you did get pregnant because your husband's going to be in a million pieces.  Oh.  And then he went on to describe how he was going to hurt my husband.  And he was very kind and very sweet.  Not hurt, kill.  Kill.  Kill. 
[03:08:00]  And he said, we all know what happened to Kennison when he crossed me.  So.  Was that a line that was.  Did Dice say that?  That's in the police report.  He said that to me and he was very kind through the whole thing and that's the reason why we  called him police.  Dice, did you say you know what happened to Kennison when he crossed me?  They're completely lying and embellishing their story.  Oh, okay.  They're making me sound like a hitman from the mob.  Did you say look what happened to Kennison?  Did you say look what happened to Kennison?  I've had lots of fights with comics over the years like Kennison and Belzer.  Professional comics, you know. 
[03:08:30]  Comics that do this for a living.  You know.  The only concern was they said it to me.  And they don't have their wives calling me up.  I mean, just the fact he's got his wife there, you know, like his apron, holding his apron  strings.  Why is his wife even there today?  You know why my wife.  Why does she have to protect you?  Why can't you talk to yourself?  Don't worry.  I'm not going to beat you up.  I'm not going to lay a hand on you.  I'm not worried about you beating me up.  That never crossed my mind.  You called the police.  As far as the girl situation, you know, I'm not the one that tells you not to leave it in 
[03:09:00]  your pants.  That's between you two.  What do I know what goes on?  You know what I mean?  You want to lie about me?  No.  You want to tell me you want me in a coffin and I mention you're talking to girls coming  out of the bathroom and that's why you're going to the cops?  That's between you two.  Honey, if you can't keep it in his pants, that's your problem.  But I don't need harassing calls.  That's not what we were talking about.  I don't need harassing calls from a wife.  That wasn't harassing.  Who's going to marry me?  You were very kind to me. 
[03:09:30]  You were very kind to me.  It wasn't harassing at all.  So why are you saying I'm going to blow him into a million people?  That's what you told me.  And I'm going, what?  You said, I hope you got pregnant because your husband's going to be in a million pieces.  That made me upset.  No, I did not say that.  You are just lying through your teeth and you were very upset when you called me.  I know.  I thought I was very nice to you.  I'm a terrorist.  I was very calm.  And you just happened to have a husband that can't stand on his own two feet.  No.  I guess we'll see.  I called actually on my own. 
[03:10:00]  And then other people are going, then I'm talking to Opie and he goes, well, you know,  the line he actually said about the coffin line is from Otto and George.  Yeah.  Is that true, Jay?  Yes.  Yeah.  That's true.  Get in a coffin, die.  Get in a coffin, die.  No.  Now, wait a minute.  Time out.  Are you going to kill Anthony now because you just said it?  No, no.  Wait a minute.  I'm supposed to know now that what comic you're taking for, like you used me on Conan.  Yesterday you're using Otto and George.  What are you, like a cover band? 
[03:10:30]  Are you like the cover comic?  You cover all the comics material?  Guys, we're all friends with Otto and George and we all throw around George's lines here  on the show.  No, but what I'm supposed to know is what act he's ripping off at the time.  Were you doing Otto or the dummy?  I mean, am I supposed to know that too?  I'd like to know what any of this has to do with you making my wife cry.  Why is your dumb wife even calling me up?  Oh, Jesus.  Boy, you're building your fan base.  Why is she calling me up?  Because all I'm getting is harassing calls on my phone from you. 
[03:11:00]  And that's actually what women do.  This isn't the Middle East.  Women stand up for themselves.  From your wife.  From your friend.  This isn't the Middle East.  Women stand up for themselves.  I did not like what you said and I asked if we could talk and you were very cool.  You talked to me.  This isn't the Middle East.  Well, you know what?  If somebody said to you that they want you in a coffin, Jake.  I didn't say I wanted you in a coffin.  And you have you.  I did not say that.  We can replay the tapes.  We can replay the tapes.  And mention something.  I don't know what your anti-Semitic remark was because I hope he won't play it back. 
[03:11:30]  Hold on.  Do you happen to remember that?  Oh, dice.  We played the whole argument when we first got here today.  Yeah.  So what was that remark about?  I don't know what you're talking about.  Of course you don't.  This has nothing to do.  I think it has a lot to do with it, Jay.  I think you're calling him a Jew in a heat.  If you have a comedy fight, that's okay if you're keeping it to jokes and being funny.  Because people want to laugh.  Then why did you tell my wife you're going to put me in a million pieces and that's...  When you start telling a guy you want him in a coffin dead, you know what?  I didn't say I wanted you in a coffin dead. 
[03:12:00]  I never said the phrase, I want you in a coffin dead.  You're lying.  Did you kill Kenison, guys?  Maybe I'm not phrasing it exactly how you would like me to phrase it right now.  I said, die, get in the coffin.  You know what I mean?  And that's not a threat.  Die, die, get in the coffin, that's not a threat?  You've been told that 5,000 times on this show.  In whose opinion?  Everyone's?  No, not everybody.  Yours.  Just like you embellished to the police, you know, all kinds of nonsense.  You're a baby.  I did not embellish a word.  This has nothing to do with Jay. 
[03:12:30]  I personally did not embellish a word.  You got every cop in New York working on a disaster and you're running there because  you're afraid that your husband's running.  Of course, I made a comment about girls.  No, no, no.  Not at all.  Actually, that wasn't it at all.  As a matter of fact, you handled that.  You were very kind about it and we moved on.  That's not the reason for the call.  No, but the point is, you don't think that was wrong?  The reason for the call is because you threatened my husband.  You're messing with my house.  I don't like that.  I'll admit, I was very angry at your husband because he wasn't being a comedian.  He was just being nasty because he had nowhere to go. 
[03:13:00]  Did you tell my wife you were going to make sure I paid and I was going to die, if not  at the beacon?  No, I never said that.  And that's what happened to Kennison when he crossed you.  Oh, so now I killed Kennison?  That's what you said?  That's what you said?  You said that we all know what happened.  Go off the road.  It was all about me.  You're an idiot.  Direct quote.  We all know what happened to Kennison when he crossed me.  No, it's not a direct quote.  That is what you're saying is a lie.  Verbatim.  Okay, it's a lie.  I do not embellish.  I do not embellish because this is too serious.  I know you don't embellish.  That's why you're in a radio station with him holding your thing over there. 
[03:13:30]  He's holding my hand because I am freaked out.  He is actually very calm.  Well, what are you freaked out about?  I'm upset.  You're upset that maybe he's playing with other girls, but you know what?  He's a very handsome guy.  No, I'm upset that you threatened to kill my husband.  I'm not killing your husband.  I'm not going to go near your husband.  I would love to stoop every hot girl that walks into a comedy club.  That's not what my problem is.  All right, hold on.  Nicole, let's put that to rest.  I'm not going to go near your husband.  I'm not going to beat him up because I'm not going to get anybody, number one, that's not a challenge. 
[03:14:00]  I'm not worried about you beating up my husband, but I'd prefer if one of your followers don't try to kill him.  No, you wouldn't.  I think Jay could take you, Dice.  It would just be a beating.  You know what?  Take some bets on that.  I think Jay could take Dice.  Jay couldn't last 60 seconds with me.  With the two of you helping him.  Hey, now, don't drag me into this.  I drag everybody into it.  That's how I am.  But as far as the girls, hey, look.  That's not a concern.  We covered that.  Dice, we already covered that. 
[03:14:30]  I'm not concerned about that.  That's not the issue.  That is not the issue.  Nicole, what are you trying to get in here?  You want him a team now?  Relax.  Hell no.  I'm a student.  I'm a 31-year-old woman back in college.  I have nothing to do with show business.  I am trying to apologize for upsetting you.  If I said something to upset you, I do apologize about that.  But he happens to be a very handsome man.  And, you know, girls notice him.  Great.  He can't help that.  I agree.  That is not the concern.  What do you think he's on the Regis show?  You've got 20 million bored housewives watching this guy, you know, playing with that vibrator 
[03:15:00]  going, oh, he's a good-looking guy.  I welcome that.  I encourage that.  And every now and then, I do one for it in honor of the fans.  Trust me.  It's a good thing.  This is what I'm saying.  He's a very handsome man.  I don't like it when you tell me you're going to kill my husband.  All right, so Dice.  I'm not killing you.  All right, Dice, you're not going to kill Jay more, right?  I've never hit anybody.  All right.  Dice, you're not going to kill Jay.  No, I'm not killing him. 
[03:15:30]  I'm not hitting him.  I was very aggravated when he said whatever he said about the coffin.  I'm sorry I can't quote it correctly for you today, Jay.  The exact phrase was, die, get in the coffin.  And what about the nail, Jay?  Did we forget that part?  What nail?  Never said it.  You think my kids would be happy with you saying that?  Well.  Do you think I have kids that happen to love their crazy father?  Hey, Dice.  They wouldn't appreciate your little comment.  You know what I mean?  Dice, the misunderstanding is that Jay was doing a line from Otto and George. 
[03:16:00]  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  And you did not know that.  If he would actually put together his own material instead of stealing from every comic.  Well, then you know what?  Then O.P. and Anthony, you two must be the biggest hacks in the Western world.  Well, I would admit to that in a second.  Because I've heard, Dice, on the show, you've said die, get in the coffin a thousand times  for the long.  You know what?  They never said that to me.  Absolutely.  As far as I remember, they have never said that to me.  I remember Dice here live, and I was going to get in the coffin, die, die, say.  Now, that sounds like the puppet.  Whoa, Jay.  That I would understand. 
[03:16:30]  See, Jay, me and you, I've got to get together so I can teach you how to do the puppet better.  Look, you've got to understand.  I got a call from a detective.  I actually thought it was you guys playing games with me at first.  It was all for me.  I'm saying, what is this, fucking Anthony over here?  Huh?  Did you just curse?  No.  Did you just curse?  No, I used it in a radio term.  No, no.  I didn't curse.  You just cursed.  No, but not the way you think.  See, I thought you guys were playing us, so I don't know.  No, I wasn't playing.  I'm telling you.  I'm talking to him.  I get a beep, and it's this detective. 
[03:17:00]  My boy's at the tent.  Right.  There were a lot of laughs.  I had a good time with them.  And they're going, so this guy comes in, saying he's a big star, Jay Who, and I'm going, no.  He came to my apartment.  I didn't go anywhere, so that's a lie already.  So where do we leave this?  Well, you know, I'm trying to apologize for something he said.  Okay.  That he fueled the fire.  So now what's my move?  What's your move?  Yeah, now I've got to take legal action against you. 
[03:17:30]  All right, hold on.  So the deal is, so far, we've worked out that you're not going to kill Jay Moore, right?  No, I'm not going to hurt him in any way.  But you're pissed because Jay...  Because I don't need any more calls.  Who's going to call next?  His mommy?  His brother?  Oh, jeez.  Kids in the family, don't hit him.  So now you're upset because the cops called you.  Well, I just think that he could have handled it on his own.  You give it a day to rest, and you call me up.  I did call you, and you hung up on me.  I was angry at the time.  So why would we call?  I said, can we talk like grown-ups, and you hung up on me. 
[03:18:00]  My wife called you, and you said, I hope you did get pregnant,  because that's the only chance you're going to get,  because your husband's going to be in a million pieces.  No, not a million pieces.  Yes, it's exactly what you said.  And you said, we all know what happened to Kenison when he crossed me.  No, no, no, that's a direct question.  You said, I don't know who your husband knows in New Jersey,  but I know more people, and they're already working on it.  Trust me.  Your husband has to look over his shoulder at the Beacon,  the Comedy Store, and the Laugh Factory,  because we will get him.  Your husband has to pay.  That, my friend, is a death threat that made my wife cry. 
[03:18:30]  I'm not afraid for my own safety.  But when you bring my family into it and make my wife cry...  If you bring my family into it, you've got a problem.  I didn't bring your family into it.  I was trying to save you.  No, you already admitted I didn't bring your family into it.  I'll say what I said.  I'm talking more than dice?  Back up what I say.  I'm not you.  I've got to pee.  I'm not a little pansy that brings his wife to the radio station.  Hold me.  I came on my own.  Hold me.  I came on my own.  I'm not going to yell at you.  You're not in the business.  This is not our fight.  Okay.  What is it?  I'm not even going to bring you up.  It's like the mob. 
[03:19:00]  You're not in the business.  I'm not even told this detective, okay?  Yeah.  I said we were on the radio, and when Jay said what he said to me about being in a coffin,  the way I put it, with a nail in it, I got very angry, and I said,  I dare you to try to stand toe-to-toe with me at the comedy store and say that to my face.  I would break both your arms and legs.  That's what I would do.  And I told that to the detective.  I said, but I was very angry, and it was a fight on the radio,  and I don't know why this jerk-off is even coming in and talking to you about this. 
[03:19:30]  He's supposedly doing a benefit, you know, for this New York cause,  and he's wasting your time on this nonsense on a radio fight?  Dice, why do you got to threaten bodily harm to people?  Why do you got to be a tough guy?  I'm not the tough guy.  He said to me that...  You're being a tough guy.  Nah, that...  Everyone...  Let me explain something.  Yeah.  I'm over here right now, right?  Let me explain something.  Okay.  I'm over here. 
[03:20:00]  We're over here.  Because I said...  Right.  You're over there.  Right.  All right, so we're having an argument on the phone.  Sure.  He says something that really pushes a button, aggravates me,  because whenever anybody says something about my kid's father to cause bodily harm to me,  that will be repercussion.  But my kid's father, wouldn't that be you?  But by last night...  That's you.  What's that?  Your kid's father is you.  You.  What do you mean?  You say things about you.  Why don't you say...  When he says things about me. 
[03:20:30]  You gotta say my kid's father.  It could be good.  The kids have nothing to do with it.  He didn't say it with my kids.  He's talking about me.  The kids have nothing to do with it.  No, the kids have everything to do with it.  No.  Dice, you take your Paxil today.  Who is he?  You know what I mean?  I don't do those things.  All right, so...  I'm very sober.  So, are we gonna drop this?  Are you all right with the cops calling you?  Well, you know, maybe he should change his name to Jay Less.  Maybe he should talk a little less instead of more. 
[03:21:00]  Get it?  A little less, more.  All right, I don't even...  Get it?  More?  Jay left the studio.  Jay left the studio.  Of course he left the studio, and he leaves his poor little wife.  He'll be right back.  Defend for herself?  Please.  You called out a good man?  Oh, he's the best, and he defended me the way I would hope to be defended.  Well, how did he defend you?  He made sure I stopped crying by calling him for themselves.  Do you want to hear your message?  Would you like to hear your message?  I got it right in front of me.  Guys, would you like to hear it?  Great.  Sure. 
[03:21:30]  You're recording stuff.  No, it's on the message machine.  Here, let me play this for you.  What are you?  I'll play you what his wife says.  I'm Instagram.  All right, here it is.  Paranoid Dice, recording everything.  Yeah.  Here it is.  All right.  Tuesday, 11, 12 p.m.  Hi, Andrew.  This is Nicole Moore.  I'm Jay Moore's wife calling.  Hey, listen.  This completely has nothing to do with anything else, and I am truly, actually, myself, a fan.  You see what I mean?  The girls call me up to tell me she's a big fan. 
[03:22:00]  Right.  You see what I mean?  I had nothing but respect when I called you.  I had nothing but respect for you when I called you.  And I was nice to you, too, as a matter of fact.  Very nice.  But then you told me you were going to kill my husband, and that, to me, is upsetting.  I'm not a person who shakes me to you.  No, but what I'm, you know, what I was trying to convey is he shouldn't have said what he said.  You can't say you're going to kill people.  And if he didn't say, well, that's why I'm apologizing, because I've lost my temper.  I'm not in the business, but one thing I know is that usually when you go... 
[03:22:30]  Why are you even paying attention to this nonsense?  Because you said it to me.  It involved me.  Why are you calling me?  You're threatening death, Dice.  No, I wasn't threatening death.  You're like Dice from the movies.  I said I might break a few things if he gets in my face and lays a hand on me.  Dice, you thought you were Ford Fairlane from me.  Ain't me.  Ain't me.  What?  If somebody laid a hand on you, would you defend yourself?  But no one laid any hands yet.  No, but I'm just saying to you, you wouldn't defend yourself if somebody tried to hurt you.  No, so there. 
[03:23:00]  So if somebody came over to you and started clubbing you to death, they'd say, oh, have  a good time for yourself.  Yeah.  For a goof.  As a matter of fact, why don't you start, break all my toes, first?  For a goof.  Then my knees.  Then I want you to rip all the teeth out of my head, put it on a wooden stick, and make  it chomp away at my ear and beg.  Mine now.  As long as they use some pliers or something to make it a little more painful?  Sure, why not?  All right, look, I'm going to accept Jay's apology.  Well, Jay didn't even apologize.  He should apologize, because if he didn't say that thing, none of this misunderstanding 
[03:23:30]  would have happened.  He's taken the longest leak in the history of radio.  You talk like you've got a gang, the people in Jersey, like you've got your feelers out.  You talk like a...  Oh, when you're a dice, you're a dice all the way.  From your first cigarette, to your last dying day.  See, and that's the problem.  When you're a rug shit.  His wife actually got hurt because of the girl comment.  No, it's because you threatened to kill her husband.  No, no. 
[03:24:00]  All right.  You want more of a message?  Sure.  All right, here's the whole message.  Okay.  The whole thing.  Can we get Jay in here so we can, like, get this to end?  Hi, Andrew.  This is Nicole Moore.  I'm Jay Moore's wife calling.  Hey, listen.  This is completely, has nothing to do with anything else.  I am truly, actually, myself a fan.  And I just wanted to pass on to you.  This is pretty ironic, actually.  I really was standing on my head.  We really are trying to make a baby right now, me and Jay.  And so the part when you were saying that he was hitting on every woman who comes out of the bathroom, that kind of stuff, that was a little hard for me. 
[03:24:30]  And I know it is, you know, just you guys are having your disagreements about what you're having, a disagreement, and that has nothing to do with me.  But just that one little part about, you know, my husband hitting on other women and all that stuff when we're trying to make a baby, that's just a little hard.  So I just wanted to ask you or just put in my two cents worth just about that little part.  Okay, you hear it?  Okay.  All right, so she was upset about the girl thing.  All right.  All right, Jay's back in the studio. 
[03:25:00]  Can we, like, wrap this up?  Well, I'm trying to.  Okay.  You know, so isn't that what upset you, Nicole?  I just wanted to straighten it out.  Isn't that what you said on the machine, yes or no?  Answer the jury.  Jury.  Is that what upset me?  Yes.  Okay.  But it wasn't because, let me emphatically state, it wasn't because I believed what you said was true.  It was because I don't like that kind of, I don't want to be how it turns my wife.  Look, I don't know what goes on between you.  That's your business.  I told you he's handsome.  I basically, no, I have no problem with that.  I just basically don't want to be.  As a matter of fact, I got another apology to make. 
[03:25:30]  I called him Gilligan yesterday.  And that's not true.  As a matter of fact, he should be the leading man.  He should remake movies like Elvis did, like, girls, girls, girls.  You know what I mean?  Girls in the morning, girls in the evening, walking in a wiggle in by...  Come on, sing it, Jay.  You know the song.  Insane.  My concern was not at all about what my husband was doing.  In the talking lot.  That's all that factory.  That's all.  All right.  I'm just goofing around.  I'm trying to make light of this.  Come on.  Why don't we all just shut up and let Jay and Dice just talk for a minute? 
[03:26:00]  All right.  Let's talk, Jay.  And then maybe we can move on with our radio show today.  All right.  Come on.  You got a big benefit.  You got it, though.  Jay Moore.  You privately, without me in the room, told my wife you were going to kill me.  And that upset my wife very much and made her cry.  All right.  But let's get this clear.  I did not say I was going to kill you.  Dice, you need to be quiet until he's done.  No, but I want to get the facts straight.  You'll be able to respond.  Oh, like a...  I don't fear...  Dice, I don't fear you doing bodily harm on me, but I know you got guys around you 
[03:26:30]  that are crazy enough that when I'm waiting for my car at the valet, they could club me  in the back of the head with a golf club because they want to open for you all over the country.  So, when that happened and my wife starts crying because maybe she's pregnant...  Is he on hold right now?  Oh.  So, when you say that's...  We all know what happened to Kinnison.  You're just saying ridiculous things.  It's me and that person.  Okay?  That's what I was saying to you on the radio.  That you would never have the guts to stand in front of me. 
[03:27:00]  Well, we'll see.  You know, that's what I was saying.  You have the guts to stand in front of me.  You can say any...  You know what, Dice?  You can say anything you want.  You know what I mean?  I don't know where you're coming up with guys around me that are going to do things.  Nobody's doing anything to you.  All right.  You know?  And I know you got a little afraid and I know you're that kind of guy.  You know?  What kind of guy is that, Dice?  You're a little sissy.  You know?  A little sissy Mary.  But I could still like you.  And let's not forget, in your apology, you called my wife dumb and called out my mother. 
[03:27:30]  You know what?  I apologize.  Once again, she got me a little angry.  Okay.  She's a very nice girl.  By what?  By being kind?  By what?  She's so kind it freaked you out and bothered you?  She's a very nice girl.  Believe me.  You played the message to defend yourself and it sounded like she was really kind on the  answering machine.  She was very kind.  That's why I played the message.  And in that message, she stated that what really bothered her, she doesn't care what's  going on with us, that I mentioned the thing about the girls at the comedy store. 
[03:28:00]  But you know what?  I call it the way I see it.  And if you want to play games with me and talk about that I should be in a coffin, well,  I'm going to pull the plug.  Say this guy wants to hit below the belt, I'll hit below the belt.  I don't think anybody hit below the belt.  You know what I mean?  So don't tell me you don't stand out there and play with the little girls.  That's your problem.  Okay?  Don't make me give exact quotes because then she'll know I'm telling the truth.  So if you want to end this thing, let's end this thing.  I'm calling to apologize.  You'll be in a hump about it.  I haven't actually said anything. 
[03:28:30]  Well, that's what I mean.  You've got to apologize back.  What?  I don't think I have room in my heart to apologize to somebody that made my wife cry.  Well, then maybe I don't have room in my heart.  Well, fantastic.  You know what I mean?  So nothing got settled today.  I think the truth just really hurts.  You want to call the cops and embellish like I got a gang, which I don't.  I'm a comic for 23 years.  I never hit one other person, not one other comic, nobody.  I don't know what you've been doing, but that's not how I operate. 
[03:29:00]  But I do stand up for myself.  And what you said on the air yesterday was wrong.  And you can't even cop to that.  You couldn't even cop to the fact that you used the line on the Conan show.  If at least you said, all right, Dice, I used the line, I wasn't doing it.  I'd say, all right, it's not the first time, you know, and that would have been the end of it.  But you couldn't cop to it.  You couldn't think of anything comedic.  So you start with the die, die, get in the coffin with a nail in it.  And that's when I pull the plug.  All right, we've heard all that. 
[03:29:30]  I know, but he keeps going.  I can't find room in my heart.  I'm the one trying to let this go.  All right, so I'm the one getting calls yesterday from his wife, from his friend, from the police.  Because you're the one that told my wife that she was going to find me in a million pieces.  No, I never said I was going to kill you.  You said you were going to find me in a million pieces.  We all know what happened to Kenison when he crossed me.  Your husband has to pay.  I had fights with Bill.  And if not me, someone that I know will get your husband. 
[03:30:00]  Whether it's at the Beacon.  You know what?  All right, then my wife's a liar.  Then I'm married to a liar.  Then your wife isn't that nice and she's lying to your face, okay?  All right, well, you've called my wife.  I never said any of those things.  During your apology, you've called my wife stupid and you've called out my mother.  But that's the way it is.  You've apologized to me by calling my wife stupid and calling out my mother.  No.  Yes.  I didn't call out your mother.  You just said, who's going to call me next, your mommy?  Yeah, I said, who's going to call me, your mommy?  Who's next?  All right.  You know, that's me trying to lighten things up and go, who's going to call me? 
[03:30:30]  Your bigger brother?  I mean, what's going on here with you?  Are you that insecure?  Are you that afraid that you really think I'm going to beat you up?  No, my physical safety was never a concern.  Do you really think I would approach you and just lift my hands like some street animal and hurt you?  Is that what you really believe?  No.  Okay, so why are we even going into that?  Why did he even go that far?  Because you told my wife.  You told my wife in private.  He said it wasn't about that.  He said it was about the fight you were having with your wife about other women. 
[03:31:00]  That's a lie.  You know what I'm really upset about?  You want to know?  Put him on hold for a second.  I know I'll interrupt me here.  The detective told me, Dice is a Jewish kid from Brooklyn that took a lot of beatings.  I know this because I was one of the guys that gave him a beating.  That's what the detective told me.  Your buddy's in the 10th.  Well, we know that's not true.  There's another lie.  Okay.  Well...  You know something?  Will I admit that...  Let's call Billy Mac.  He was there.  Will I admit I got...  There was a policeman in the...  Yeah, I've gotten beat a lot. 
[03:31:30]  And that's why I'm certainly not afraid of a little guy like you.  A little wimp guy that stands behind his wife's coattails and hides there.  All right.  Well...  If you would have came clean, this whole thing would have been over.  But you can't even do that now.  Guys, they don't even...  Clean about what?  They don't even nail coffins shut anymore, do they?  No, no, no.  If I could bring that up.  I'm trying to be a nice guy here.  It's factual here.  Anthony, this just in.  CNN is doing dick jokes today.  Are they?  Yes.  Dice, are you going to have Jay killed at the Beacon gig?  No.  I'm not doing anything to Jay. 
[03:32:00]  We could know that Jay will not be killed at that gig.  I would like to say...  Thank God.  You're not going to pull an Abe Lincoln or anything, are you?  No.  I'm just going to do what I've got to do on this end to protect myself from him.  There's Dice with the Abe Lincoln being in that.  Why do you say I'm a pussy?  He's like John Wilkes Booth.  I don't understand why you say I'm a pussy and I'm a homo and I'm a pansy boy.  But then why do you have to protect yourself from me?  Okay, listen.  Then why would you have to protect yourself from a pansy?  No, what I'm going to do, I'm going to protect myself legally because what you set up, according 
[03:32:30]  to people I spoke to, is that if you do now approach me at the comedy store and you attack  me and I hit you, that it's on record that I hit you.  You see what I mean?  No, I don't know what that means.  I'm just going to put a little lean against you, if you know what I mean.  If you want to play that game.  We have to play commercials.  Since you're not man enough to just go, hey, Dice, it was a misunderstanding.  What's a misunderstanding about making my wife cry by telling her you're going to kill me?  You're not going to cry.  I'm not the one standing at the comedy store going, I'm really horny. 
[03:33:00]  My wife is gone for six weeks.  I'm going to have a good time.  That's not me.  That's you, my friend.  No, first of all, I don't hit on the waitresses.  We can get Ralphie May on the phone, who's with me at the comedy store all the time.  What about Ralphie May?  Yeah, why?  Because he's going to say what's true?  Why does this always get back to Ralphie May, Anthony?  Because Ralphie May's the guy that he brought up.  Okay.  And I don't hit on the waitresses.  I don't even know the waitresses.  I don't even know anybody at the comedy store.  And you know what?  When I go to the comedy store, I go on first out of respect to you.  You know, just like you lied about everything yesterday, you're lying right now.  Dice.  East Coast, West Coast. 
[03:33:30]  There's an East Coast, West Coast comedy thing happening here.  Dina Cola got clipped the other night.  That was me.  I'm coming for you.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break, Dice.  All right, well, let's make this right here.  Let's end this.  We gave them a great show.  I didn't really say much.  Let's make this right.  Come on now.  Come on, boy.  You know you still love me, too thick and thin.  We're going to break in ten seconds.  Nine.  Jay?  Eight.  Jay, come on now. 
[03:34:00]  I have nothing to say.  Look at your wife.  Let it go.  I've got nothing to say.  I have nothing to say.  What do you think Yom Kippa's about?  The Day of Atonement.  You forgive everybody.  You threaten death.  It's a police matter.  All right, well, we have to take a break, Anthony.  All right.  Thank you, Dice.  All right, goodbye.  Bye.  Hi, this is Jay Moore, and I'm supposed to say something witty and funny here.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, and suck it.  Fuck, I can't do any, Steve.  Opie and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian, Jay Moore.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:34:30]  Hey, we're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  Lots of instant feedback coming in.  This is my favorite from Espo in Jersey.  Of course Jay Moore would call the cops to keep Dice away.  He wouldn't even fire Jerry Maguire unless he was in a crowded restaurant.  That's the movies.  Man. 
[03:35:00]  I don't know.  Killer?  Killer Dice?  Screaming Trees?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You already lost two.  I'm a serial killer.  We're starting to think he's mental.  A little mental.  Crazy Dice Man.  I think he could be a little crazy.  Crazy Dice.  I'll never tell.  Oh!  Hello, Clarice.  It's Crazy Dice.  Crazy Dice, sure. 
[03:35:30]  Here's Dice.  Pops through the door.  Wendy, I'm home.  Oh!  I'm not going to hurt you.  He'll dress up Club Soda Kenny like his mom.  She's a whore, Norman.  Norman.  She's a whore.  Crazy Dice, sure.  I hate this place. 
[03:36:00]  Nothing works here.  The medication don't work.  I've been here seven years.  I hate this place.  Oh!  Killer Dice.  It puts the lotion on its skin.  Or else it gets the hose again.  Oh!  Hickory dickory dog.  Jay, what's up?  What?  What's up?  Oh, no.  I was giving Rick Ralphie May's phone number.  Ralphie May.  No, because Dice told... 
[03:36:30]  We're going to get Ralphie May in this now.  Because Dice told Ralphie May the same things he told my wife.  And Ralphie May is friends, or was friends with Dice.  And...  Well, we're running out of show.  So if we're going to talk to Ralphie May, we've got to do it immediately.  Oh, there's the phone number.  Immediately.  Immediately.  I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!  Oh, the crazy bird!  I'm like a crazy bird!  I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!  What is with that guy?  He's lost his mind. 
[03:37:00]  You see what happened to the Kinnison?  What did he do?  I paid some kid money to kill him.  It's great.  He drove the truck right into him.  I want to call a meeting of all the five families.  I'm going to wax them, and we're going to the mattresses.  Remember in Mafia when they go, we have the Botolatos from the north side, the so-and-sos from the east side, the Jeffersons. 
[03:37:30]  And they cut, it was actually the Jeffersons.  That was funny.  Oh, easy.  Ralphie May.  That's me, the kid!  Ralphie.  Yeah!  Opie and Anthony, nice to meet you.  What's up, Ralphie May?  Pleasure.  What can you add to this?  Yeah, Ralphie, we've got to make it fast, because we're running out of time on this radio show.  Ralphie, was my wife lying when Dice said those things to her?  No.  But how does Ralphie know?  Because he talked to Dice immediately afterwards.  Oh, okay.  He used to be friends with Dice.  So, Ralphie, what's up?  What can you add to this?  All I've got to say is a couple things. 
[03:38:00]  Yesterday, Andrew was talking smack about how Jay turns his back on his friends.  Look, Jay Moore feeds me.  He keeps my apartment rented to me.  He helps me out with my rent when I need it.  I'm 400 pounds.  He's got me going to the gym.  He's helping me with my weight.  He gives me work.  He hasn't turned his back on me at all.  And we were friends before we were working together.  He was just a buddy.  And he didn't show up at his own birthday party.  Jay, Jesus Christ.  That was my favorite story.  Like, why would Dice go? 
[03:38:30]  And he didn't show up at his own birthday party.  I had the hat on.  I wanted to play pin the tail on the donkey.  And Jay didn't show up.  I left crying.  I brought something for a grab bag.  A yam bag.  That's what started it.  Did he get to swing at the piñata, Dice?  Yeah, I swung at the piñata.  It was talking to me.  Actually, I couldn't hit it myself.  So I sent some pals to beat it up. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, look out, piñata.  Look out, piñata.  You know what makes me...  Ralphie doesn't get you guys in L.A. yet.  Yeah.  And I just know Ralphie's real high right now enjoying himself.  Yeah.  Very high.  So, Ralphie, you never threw a birthday party for Jay Moore.  It was just a barbecue.  Okay.  It was a surprise for him.  All right?  But I didn't...  He never confirmed because I'm a stupid ass and I didn't leave my phone number.  Wait, it was a surprise party for Jay and Jay never showed? 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, because it was just a barbecue.  It was just a barbecue.  I saw a barbecue last week for National Potato Week.  I saw a barbecue.  Any time to eat is a good time for me.  All right?  That's the truth.  All right?  Jay Jay, man, he didn't show up.  You think I was going to stop my barbecue?  Hell no.  It was more cake for me.  All right.  All right.  So, was Dice at the barbecue with a little present for Jay?  Yeah.  He was just sitting there with his little wrap present.  I was waiting for musical chairs. 
[03:40:00]  Look at what somebody made already.  Jay at the beacon.  Jay's head on Lincoln's body and Dice's on John Wilkes Booth's body.  You know, there I go.  Andrew loved the chicken.  He took home the chicken and the sauce and stuff like this.  I don't know, man.  I'm just saying, Jay's always been cool to me.  I ain't never seen anything.  I think Miss Moore's got a great husband.  I think Mrs. Moore's got an awesome son.  Hey, Ralphie, how much pot did you smoke today? 
[03:40:30]  I took, honestly, four big long loads.  All right.  I have good cali-chronic.  But, you know, I started early.  You know, you got to get the jump on the high.  You know what I'm saying?  You don't let the dick creep up on you.  I'm protected.  You'll see it up all the time.  Hey, sweetheart, what did Dice say to you?  Dice said to me that he was going to snap me like a twig.  He was going to break his arms and legs.  And then he backed off that a little bit.  I think he's just pissed.  But I don't think it's about a yambag. 
[03:41:00]  Jesus Christ.  A yambag has caused all this drama?  Yeah, this all started because of the word yambag.  It's always about a yambag.  Look, Dice, let's understand.  The more that about a comic doing other comics material is that Dice has fundamentally changed  the vocabulary of America.  Who says ass pipe?  Only Andrew.  Now everybody says.  Wee, wee, wee.  Exactly.  I'm on the Zoloft to keep from killing y'all.  Oh!  See what I'm saying? 
[03:41:30]  Dice has changed the vocabulary.  All right, Ralph.  I'm glad you called and set the record straight that I'm not Hollywood and turned my back on  my friends.  No, no.  Jake is fine from Hollywood.  You know, we hang out on the front street from my apartment complex.  And mine's a ghetto, Geechee-ass place.  He's right there with us.  He ain't Hollywood.  Hollywood.  Out of respect, he parts a Mercedes two blocks away and walks over.  Out of respect.  Come on.  You can't go wrong with that.  Pays a local kid to watch it.  All right.  All right, Ralphie. 
[03:42:00]  I'm that strong.  I'll call you again, kids.  It was fun.  Peace.  Peace.  All right, bye.  I'm 400 pounds.  He feeds me.  Is he really 400 pounds?  Yeah, he used to be 700.  He was in a car accident.  He was in like...  No one can get up to 700 pounds.  Well, spend three years in a hospital bed.  All you can do is sit there, watch TV, and eat and hate yourself.  And he's still at 400?  He's down to 400.  Down to 400.  I don't care what you say or don't say.  I'm going to torture you anyway.  Wait, what movie was that? 
[03:42:30]  Come on, dude.  True Romance.  Reservoir Dog.  Oh, Reservoir Club.  That's right.  Okay.  True Romance.  Stuck in the middle with you.  You want me to play the music for you?  Do you know me?  I'm the Antichrist.  And you got me in a vendetta kind of mood.  I work as consul to Blulu Boyle.  I don't believe you.  That's of minor importance.  What's of major effing importance is that I believe you.  Where's your son?  He's doing my act.  Sonny. 
[03:43:00]  Then let me in.  Oh, guys.  Listen, I'm a little bugged out with you guys because you're really not giving Dice's props.  You know, you're not mentioning the fact that yesterday, he called Dice a Jew, and that's  what got the whole thing bugged out.  And Dice doesn't want to discuss it.  Dice is a Jew.  Why is that offensive?  Why is that offensive?  Hey, Jay, you said yesterday, I think I hit his sore spot.  I embrace it.  I embrace it.  I eat the matzo. 
[03:43:30]  The bottom line is that he was bugged out over the fact that you said that.  And then when your wife called him, a little inappropriate that your wife goes on the radio  today and says, oh, she was not bothered by that comment.  And then his tape indicates that she was bothered.  All right.  You know, lay off the guy.  Sonny, they were fighting, and both of them said, you know, stuff they probably wish they  could take back.  Absolutely.  But you know what?  Don't pick on Dice like he's a crazy man.  He got nuts.  Sonny, can I tell you something? 
[03:44:00]  Dice is a crazy man.  We know Dice well enough that he is chuckling over Anthony doing the crazy Dice race.  Crazy Dice!  I'm loving that too, then.  Everything must go!  Do not, because he's not.  All right.  And Dice can defend himself.  And let's not forget the reason he called the program yesterday was to attack me.  Hey, Jay, he never called your mother out either.  He said who was going to call me next?  No, he didn't call your mother out.  Come on, you're from Verona.  I did too.  Shut up, hoa!  All right, Sonny.  Thank you.  Did he call my wife stupid?  No, boy.  All right.  Crazy Dicey! 
[03:44:30]  I'm insane!  I'm killing everybody!  Wow!  You know, I see the message...  You're a local, bro.  Yeah.  I see the message board, and a lot of people say I introverted to pussy tactics by making  it a police matter, but when my wife comes in the room saying, this guy just said he's  going to make sure you die, in a nutshell, that's, it was, you know...  I understand how that could upset you, but it's Dice.  It's Dice, but there's wacky enough people out there that'll go, hey, I want to get on  Dice's good side.  I'll skull this guy in the back of the head with a putter. 
[03:45:00]  I want to open for him.  That was hysterical.  That was a good one.  I want to open for Dice.  I opened for him once.  Now I want to open for him all the time.  Okay, listen.  We got to take a quick break.  I'm an OG.  I'll never tell.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Dice checking in from over here.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Nicey, nice.  Dice, Dice, baby. 
[03:45:30]  I'm over here now.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Gotta love the Dice.  Dice, Dice, baby.  I'm over here now.  I gotta have that. 
[03:46:00]  I got your legs.  Okay, terrific.  Don't just stare at it, eat it  Just look at me like a chick with balls  He's a jack-o, it's plain to see  He's a scumbag  I'm good like that, my friend  You're full of crap 
[03:46:30]  Look what we did to you again  Obi and Anthony  Now presenting comedian, Greg Proops  And we're back with the Obi and Anthony program  In studio, Greg Proops  We'll get to Greg in one second  I just want to say hi to Anthony in Arizona  Anthony, what's up?  Hey guys, how are you?  First of all, I'm new to XM, you guys rock 
[03:47:00]  You guys have me blasting every single day  Thank you, sir  But especially when you guys do those, you know  Governor, you know, whatever  Terminator dude  Impressions are the best  But on the office pools, you know, with the lotto tickets  Typically what happens, because one pool is messed it up for everybody freaking else  Is they make you make photocopies after you come back from buying these tickets  And hand them out to all the people who got it  You can't do that swapping  It really sucks ass  But that's what I would do  I would swap it in a heartbeat  Well, what's the positive of going in on tickets with the office workers? 
[03:47:30]  Why can't you just, you know, do it yourself?  Well, because typically, you know, you have like 125, 30 bucks that you're going to buy these tickets with  That way you're only spending five bucks, but you're getting the extra 125 out of it  Yeah, if there's eight people going in five bucks a piece, that would have been 40 bucks  Correct  If you did it yourself  Now it just costs you five bucks a week instead of 40 a week  And I'm sure working at the ham plant, 40 bucks a week is a little bit of a nut for them  I would just buy one ticket a week for myself  Yeah, one ticket 
[03:48:00]  You know what, typically I don't get those pools just because I haven't got the time  But whenever it gets high, yeah, I go out and buy one quick pick  And if it wins, it wins  If not, no big deal, you know?  And you know the guy whose actual number it was is probably like  Fuck, why did I go with these people?  Yeah  Because everyone's got like, that's probably the number he would have played by himself  And he keeps thinking how much he'd have  It's my grandson's birthday  And it's the day I was married  And this, like, it's his number  And it's the weight of my wife's colostomy bag  They didn't even do it that way  This was a quick pick, I guess  Quick picks  Oh, okay  They had the old computer 
[03:48:30]  You guys rock, keep it up, please  This is the best radio I've ever heard  Yeah, we know  Thanks  You guys have a good day  I'm just kidding  Get used to a shit dick  Yeah, really  I just have Janet Jones go out and buy my tickets  She ain't come back yet  Yeah, what is it?  It's got to be split between eight people  Two million dollars worth of tickets  Yeah  What did she buy?  Yeah  Wow, she was gambling some major cash  But, you know, there's nothing wrong going on  Hey, it's legal to gamble  And it's legal to coach a team  And it's legal to do anything you want 
[03:49:00]  I think that's the new legal  I like it  Illegal is the new legal  Is the new legal?  Yeah, and I love that  A lot of people seem to be adhering to that  So why not?  You know, a lot of times the comics will be together backstage  And one of us will say  Hey, fellas  I'd like to all go in on the lottery  Why don't you run out to the drugstore  And get us a ticket?  And we'll all pool together  And there's always crushing disappointment  When we don't win  And then it's always some group in an office somewhere  Well, that's what I want to see  We need pot money, frankly  And I think it's a little more of an issue  That's what I want to see the interview with  Fuck the people that step up and win 
[03:49:30]  And get handed the big checks  Every week, I want an interview with the group of people  That still have to go back to their jobs  Because they fucking lost  That's who I want to talk to  So, another week, huh?  Or the interview with  I told you to pick 11  Or the interview with the guy  That's, you know, spending $1,000 a week  That he doesn't have  Oh, on his lottery tickets  Yeah  Or the guy that happened in the pool  But then decided not to  Because, ah, who's going to win?  Not this week, guys  Not this week  Yeah  Yeah, we'll take a week off  Then they hit  Can you imagine you take a week off 
[03:50:00]  And your numbers come in?  How do you live with yourself?  You don't  You shoot yourself  So what's up with Janet Jones?  What are they going back to that story?  I'm not certain  I think it's turned out  That everything's okay  And go back to sleep  If you're a sports better  You're likely to be busted  By your local dude  But if you're a millionaire  And have a hot blonde wife  Then rock on  And do what you do  Yeah, no one seems to really care  About this one  Seems like Janet Jones  Has some flaws  That Gretzky was looking past  Because she was so hot  Well, he was dating  Pete Rose initially  But I guess it kind of 
[03:50:30]  Broke off with him  And went with her  For the obvious reasons  Sure wasn't an ethics question  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, she liked to gamble, though  But he was cleared  I guess they had all kinds  Of wiretaps set up  And everything  Like this was a serious investigation  And all that money  That was dumped into it  Ah, nothing  Because everything's cool  Yeah, I love those kind of stories  Best of all  Well, you remember Michael Jordan  Years ago  And his father  And everything  And then he left  Professional basketball  For a couple of years  And then came back  And he was like  Oh, don't worry about it 
[03:51:00]  He just took some time off  Anyway  It's okay  Golly  What, are you going to get  In the big fuss and whatnot?  Okay  Yeah, everybody's father's  Killed by gangsters  Don't worry about it  Hey, Greg, you watching the Olympics?  I was going to  But then curling was on  Every time I turned it on  Curling?  I'm fascinated with it now  Wait, you and George Bush  I don't know what  Oh, they're playing it right now  Look at that  Why the George Bush comparison, sir?  No, but  Why did you have to  I only say that 
[03:51:30]  Because I understood  He was watching it the other day  Oh, really?  I was compelled by it, yeah  I'm not  It had nothing political to do  Are you saying it's a simple sport  That probably simpletons watch?  No, I think it's fabulous  I used to play it in bars  We didn't call it curling, though  We called it shuffleboard  Shuffleboard  It was on wood  With sawdust  The cheese shaker  They would put that stuff on it  Except they would always get mad  When girls got up  And used brooms on it  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you can't sweep  They'd be like, hey  It's my turn on the table  You can't sweep on me  With a broom  I gotta agree with Proops  I'm on a big curling  I mean, I know these guys love it  But I can't  Listen, I've been 
[03:52:00]  I spend a lot of time in Canada  And if you ever go up there  It's like on TV all the time  It's all about the curling  I've had quite a lot of curling  And, of course, in the movie  Help  And look at those  Finally-tuned athletes  I think the biggest  Disappointment of  Yeah  Is Bodie Miller, man  The cover of Time and Newsweek  Two weeks ago  Because I'm in every airport ever  So I see his  I see his fucking ass everywhere  And then what?  He gets injured  Disqualified  Played hoop  Hurt himself  Lied about it  And then completely fucked up  Don't forget about the hangovers, too 
[03:52:30]  Oh, right  Bite my ass  How about that?  You showed up 20 pounds overweight  You made zero frigging effort whatsoever  To fucking compete in these Olympics  Who?  Bodie Miller  Mr. Slalom  He was supposed to be the big star for the U.S.  He was the guy  It was such an obvious thing  Yeah, NBC-like went  We must have a white guy  That America can root for  Because the Chinese lady's gone  And then all of a sudden  This guy is the biggest fucking fruit loop  He's a big bust  You could have sent my cousin Dale 
[03:53:00]  You know what I mean?  My cousin Dale is 30 pounds overweight  He drinks a lot  He could have fucked up  And played some hoop  And then, oh man, my ankle  So that wasn't rocking my world  Are you saying we don't want to send  A black guy to the Olympics  To represent the United States?  We did send a black guy  And he won a gold medal  And he won a gold medal  He was a speed skater, right?  Yeah  Then he had an attitude, apparently  According to the media  People were like  His interview is mean  Like, hey dude  Maybe if you were the only black guy  That ever skated in your life  And was the only black guy 
[03:53:30]  In any skating rink you ever went to  You'd have a little attitude, too  But the guy did very well  I think he did a proud  Yes, I think gold medals very well  Proud for the nation  But the problem was  When he skated by the audience  He was grabbing purses  And continuing  That's right  See the type of shit he had to endure  At the skating rink  Exactly  Jokes like that  Exactly  Jokes like Jimmy  He had Patty standing on his side  Yelling at him  Where's your rock chain, skater?  But the Olympics in general  Is just a bust, though, right?  Well, I don't think for the world it is 
[03:54:00]  I think the American media  Covers it so poorly, man  You know, I turn it on to watch an event  And all you see is someone going  Well, the Americans finished fourth  Anyway  And you're like  But what about the whole event  We don't care about any other country  It's all about us  If people like sports  Then they do care about the other  Not really  Americans just care about American sports  It's just the way it is  We don't care what  Do you think we care what  I'm glad that you could speak  For all 300 million of us  I do, I do  I accept your answer  On a daily basis  I speak for everybody 
[03:54:30]  If that wasn't true  Soccer would be a big sport here  Right  We just don't care  We don't care  But they don't care about football  Because you're a white guy  That's why you don't care about soccer  We don't care about anything international  To tell you the truth  Americans are pretty much  Just whatever happens here  You notice when there's a disaster here  And people are killed  You'll rarely see their bodies on TV  But we will see foreign dead people  On the news all the time  Oh, foreign dead people  That's just good fun  They don't care as much  That's news  Like foreign dead people  Aren't as important to us  As American dead people  Alright  Yeah, no 
[03:55:00]  You've got very loose chairs here  I just have to say  I leaned back in the chair  Got kind of a Six Flags Over Opie and Anthony feel  I didn't realize  It was going to be a flume ride  I thought you were going to pass out  Well, I was drinking water at the same time  So I created my own sort of waterfall  As I fell backwards  Yeah, I hit those chairs  That make you seem like  You're going to fall backwards  Now, I'd like to see  When I was a little kid  Back in the 40s  They used to show  The whole  Sometimes whole heats  You know  The heats leading up 
[03:55:30]  To the gold medal event  And they'd show it  Sort of all day  Right  Instead of just packages about  Skippy McTavish  Is a wastrel  You know  He's been smoking pot  Since he was 11  Now in Snowcross  He's like  Okay  Alright already  Yeah  Instead of just showing the event  Can I see some fucking sports  It's a sporting event  And they tease it  They tease it  Because they want you to watch  And then you just go to CNN  Or whatever  And they're scrolling the winners  Across the screen  It's like  Oh, thanks  Or you turn on your computer 
[03:56:00]  And you already know who won  Right  But they still are  Thinking that everyone's  Going to just  Wait for them to say  You know  Who won the event  Yeah  Even though clearly  It happened a year ago  Yeah  I will say that the opening ceremonies  Were the best thing  I've ever seen  That was a little odd  That was European television  At it's finest  Yeah  That was like watching an Italian  If you've ever been to Italy  They have the best TV shows  In the world  A middle aged guy comes out  A bunch of chicks  Dance around for half an hour  They give something away  You have no idea  What the show is  At any point  Because they're giving you  No direction  Whether it's a variety show 
[03:56:30]  A game show  Some bad comedy happens  A puppet will usually come out  At some point  A puppet  Yeah  There's always a puppet  That's great  And then the opening ceremonies  Had what  Guys skating in his Christmas trees  Plastic cows being spun around  Uh-huh  And then there was road racing  At one point  A Formula One car came out  And did like donuts  Which I don't think  Is an official  Winter Olympics  No  I don't remember  It's like a NASCAR thing  Yeah  That was pretty wild  They had  NASCAR on ice  The Ricola horns come out  For no reason  That I could determine  Whatsoever 
[03:57:00]  NASCAR on ice  That's actually  The Billy Martin event  Yeah  Here finish this Hennessy  And  Don't worry about it  Get in the truck  I got the snow tires  Hell you can go uphill backwards  The Billy Martin event  I  I did love the opening ceremonies  Because it made no  And then they  They  They had a bunch of skaters  Come out and skiers  To form what was supposed  To be a ski jumper  I don't know if you saw that part  Like a Busby Berkeley  Right  Scene from the sky  But what it looked like  Because they had smoke 
[03:57:30]  Coming out the front  Was a snowboarder huffing  Before the event  It so looked like  Someone doing a pre-game  It's appropriate  Yeah  Perhaps  That was what they were going for  And the ski was broken  It never pulled up  I have to say  I love the opening  Plus Mongolia's outfits  I don't know if you saw  They had like furry  Oh with the furry hats  Yeah their outfits were awesome  England dressed like  They were in lock stock  And two smoking barrels  Everybody was wearing  Like black top coats  And fedoras  Like they were at the  Gatti trial  I couldn't even understand  That's the winter uniform 
[03:58:00]  And then now Americans  You know because of  The snowboarding thing  No one wears like  Skin tight athletic uniforms  Now everybody's wearing  Like big coat  Unless you're a loser  Yeah  I think it's better  Than the year  They all came out  With the cowboy hats on  That was a little  That was weak  Yeah  The cowboy hats was weak  And they all came out  To like 80s music  All the countries  Yeah  Came out  Young men  Are you listening to me  Just various  Without any thought to it  Yeah  80s music  So you'd hear like 
[03:58:30]  Kaja Gugu's  Too shy shy  And here comes  The Iranian contingency  Right  Walking out  And it's just  The oddest thing  I loved it  Because that to me  Was that's TV  For the world  That's what the rest  Of the world is  Young and old alike  Everybody  Hey there's disco music  And funny outfits  Look a plastic cow  What does this have to do  With sports  You don't know  What's going on  Or anything  I will say this  India had four people  On their team  India has a billion people  As a nation  Four people 
[03:59:00]  Four that are good enough  Now am I wrong  Or aren't  Isn't there like  A kind of a big  Mountain range in India  Ah yeah  Does anyone ever  Go near that  Frozen part of India  And  Might want to  Try to ski  Or something  You'd think they'd be good  At something winter  They're not athletic people  The Indians  Yeah  That's good  They don't have  Enough energy  Because they're not  Eating the cows  Four  They need protein  People  They're getting the  The golden  Customer service calling 
[03:59:30]  Yeah  Yeah  New Jersey has a bigger  Olympic team  And quite right  That kind of freaked me out  A little  So now I haven't been  Watching it as much  As I might  But now that we're  Watching morning curling  I'm getting  It's bleeding it back  Into me  That competitive fire  It's all about the curling  Now I'd love to get  Your opinion on the  The takeover of the  The docks  The shipping  Oh I think it's great  I think we should give  The Al-Qaeda  Control of the airport  Too  Because then  I could get through  Without a guy  Who failed his 
[04:00:00]  Criminal justice exam  Rubbing my balls  For half an hour  Now this is very  Very interesting  This whole situation  Because this is  It's very hard  To find the line here  Between liberal  And conservative  Between republican  And democrat  As far as this goes  On the outside  This looks like  A case of  Bigotry  Some people  Have seen this as  Hey just because  They're an Arab nation  Why can't they  Take over a port  And run it  Are you saying 
[04:00:30]  Just because they're Arab  That they're terrorists  And a lot of the liberals  Are coming forward  And are against this  And I think a lot of it  Is because Bush is for it  It's probably right  But I mean  Bush said  How can you  Why would you be  Prejudiced against  An Arab nation  I don't know  Because they're setting  Fires to embassies  Over a fucking  Marmaduke cartoon  Exactly  They're boycotting  Danish butter  And blowing up  Kentucky fried chickens  Because that hard  Hitting Danish press  That we've all had  Our eye on  Over the years  That dominates the globe  With their editorial cartoons 
[04:01:00]  Maybe the fact  They're sociopaths  In some respects  Might be a little  I'm sorry to interrupt you  But that came out  In September  That cartoon by the way  Yeah September  And it's being fueled  By fucking  By a lot of these  These imans  Or these  Whatever the fuck  They're called  These clerics  Have been fueling it  So five months later  They riot  Commit murders  Put out a fatwa  They're fucking awful  And the whole world  Is watching it  Over cartoons  Not one protest  Over Al-Zarqawi  Over 9-11  Not one violent outburst  Over Leon Klinghofer 
[04:01:30]  Or fucking Kenya  And Tanzania  Embassy bombings  Or fucking  USS Cole  Not one riot  The fucking cartoon  Comes out  And they're committing  Murders all over the planet  Well  Five months later  Against the KFC  Yeah exactly  Yeah  They stopped the McDonald's  Because the guy  Wanted eight McNuggets  Because they look like  Clits and he hates women  Fucking awful  Lovely group  They come out  Looking a little  A little crazy  Like silly geese  To the rest of the world  Like silly geese  Silly geese  Is a good way to put it  A little harsh  Obviously they have  Every right to  Have Dubai run the ports 
[04:02:00]  And if you've ever been  To the United Arab Emirates  You know that  They have quite a  Bustling port there  That's very well run  Indeed  And in fact  The smuggling hub  For the entire Persian Gulf  And has been for about  5,000 years  Because it's right across  From Iran  Yeah  But the  You know  It just seems  The timing's a little goofy  Like right when he's  Taken about  55,000 hits  In a row  To go  Hey by the way  Everybody  Dubai is going to  Control these major ports 
[04:02:30]  Might not be the most  Judicious political move  You know the ports  That I've been saying  Have been the most  The most insecure  Entry ports  Points of this country  Have been the ports  That's what everyone's  Talking about  Yes  The ports  We're taking care of  You know as much as we  Like to think  We take care of the airports  No  Things well  No but  But the shipping  I mean there's just  Container after container  Coming in that we have  No clue at all  What is in these things  And now 
[04:03:00]  To just say  Alright  We're going to give  This Arab nation  New York  L.A.  New Orleans  That's a little  That's a little risky  It's sickening  You know  The price of oil  Went up to over  $60 a barrel this year  And you may remember  When the prince came  From Saudi Arabia  Bush kissed him  And held his hand  Held his hand  They held hands  And walked  They walked  They kissed  They love each other  So you know  There's plenty of connection  Yeah  It's not like we don't  Do business with them  Plus Dubai is the  Banking center 
[04:03:30]  For the entire world  They're like the  Switzerland of that  Without being neutral  They funnel money  For the Al-Qaeda  And they funnel money  For us  From their point of view  It's simply a business transaction  They don't look at it  Like a big political thing  We go  Hey could you quit  Funneling Al-Qaeda money  And they go  But why  We do yours  You know  And then the Al-Qaeda  Says to them  Could you stop funneling  America money  And they go  But we do yours too  But I  All we're doing  Is trying to make a buck  Around here  Can Bush at least  Get credit  For bringing  Republicans  And Democrats  Together on an issue 
[04:04:00]  Absolutely  Because I've never seen  Like I say  After you find out  About Abramov  Katrina  Sheenie shooting  Someone in the face  I mean there's been  Like 7,000 things  In the last week  He could have waited  Maybe a day or two  Until the shit  Had settled a little bit  Before  By the way  Rahman Al-Qaeda  I Hate America  Is going to be  Running your port  From now on  Unbelievable  They should run  The amusement parks too  Why not  Let's go to Chester  In Florida  Hello Chester  Chester  It's actually Jester

[04:11:30]  Yes  Back to Greg Proofs  I'm sorry about the  Are we still on the air?  That's horrific  Don't know how many people  Actually ask that  Seriously  Wait this isn't on the air  Is it?  Most of them are listening  Alright where were we  We gotta focus  And get back to where we're at  Okay alright  Oh we're talking about the ports  And uh  Hilarious  And the Dick Cheney  If there's one thing  International shipping  Always funny  How funny was the  Dick Cheney thing to you?  I loved it  I think  I think people have been harsh 
[04:12:00]  I think the liberal media  Has been riding his ass  I feel that every American  Should have the opportunity  To shoot someone in the face  And then not talk to the cops  For 20 hours  I know I'd like that opportunity  At any given point  Would that be amazing  If  And then in a matter of hours  The investigation is completely closed  Oh read the report  They're satisfied  If you have any more questions  Go back to the report  Because I did a thorough  Yeah  I went to their house  I talked to the maid  Uh  The gardener  Some people who were standing nearby  Yeah  And the woman who gave the eyewitness account  From 100 yards away in a car 
[04:12:30]  Please let that be the account of my crime  When I commit a major felony  Like shooting someone in the face  With a 28 weight birdshot  From two feet away  Oh by the way  It was 30 yards away  That's why he took a  Fucking hip to head  Blast with the birdshot  Yeah  Uh  Please let the witnesses  Be as far away as possible  And be juiced  I like that he went  I had a beer  Yeah  A beer at lunch  Does Dick Cheney look like  The picture of restraint to you?  A beer  Like he doesn't lay waste to the buffet  Who has a beer?  Look fuck 
[04:13:00]  Here's the  But as far as going  The cops are concerned  You're the vice president  You're with secret service  How many cops are higher up  The ladder than that?  You think secret service trumps police  Sure  I mean  We saw what happened  It was just  You know  It had an accident  I mean I think it was kind of funny too  The greatest thing  Of course it was funny  And they played it on  The Daily Show  They played the clip  Was  Dick Cheney  During his interview  With Fox News  Saying that  It was one of the worst days  Of his life  And then his victim  Getting out of the hospital 
[04:13:30]  Giving a speech  And apologizing  Yeah  To Dick Cheney  He goes  I just want to apologize  To Dick Cheney  And his family  For all the  Sorrow  That he's had to go through  And they come back  And Jon Stewart  Is just like  This man  Is apologizing  To the man  That shot him  In the face  It's like Reginald Denny  Hugging the guys  That beat the shit out of him  That's exactly what it's like  I'm sorry  That my head is so huge  That the freedom loving pellets  That Dick Cheney  Has exploded 
[04:14:00]  From his load buster  Have hit me  In the head  He got in the way  Of his shot  Britt Hume's interview  Was so hard hitting  Britt Hume  Is just a caustic journalist  He knows how to ask  The hard hitting question  He said  Did you get the quail  He actually asked man  Well yeah  I think I wounded  The quail a little bit  I don't think that quail  Is going to be coming back  For any more  If you know what I'm saying  I'm going to nick them  The quail was hospitalized though  And he's apologized  And let me tell you something  About the media  If Albert Gore had done that  There would be no flap at all 
[04:14:30]  I mean they would be dropped  In a day's time  Honestly  Absolutely would  If Bill Clinton  Had shot someone in the face  There'd be nothing about it  He would have shot them  On the dress  You get it?  Well no matter what kind of load  You're expelling  You know what I'm saying  He expelled a load  And he took it  He had to go to a trial over it  Dick Cheney expels a load  And it's all good fun  What would have happened  If he killed him?  Dick Cheney?  Yeah  Well I would hope  That the police would close  The case very quickly  And say that  The man took his own life  By ingesting lead  But play it out  Do they cover up the whole thing? 
[04:15:00]  No I think it would have been  Investigated probably another day  It's an accident  Yeah  No because the bottom line  Is the vice president  Shoot somebody in the face  The guy's out of the hospital  In a few days  Everyone knows what happened  Just because of who he is  They make it big deal  But it happens  It was a hunting accident  He's a doddering old jizz bag  I'm glad the other guy got shot  He's a DC lawyer  Who's been fucking people  He's 78 years old  He should just hug his grandchildren  And die already  Fuck him  I have no mercy for him  I hate hunters  That's what you get  When you're out shooting birds  Take some fucking buckshot  In the face  Shit head  Yeah we found the sensitive side 
[04:15:30]  I know I've never really  Seen him open up like this  He protects  Yeat chicken  To you Jim  Oh yeah  And not only do I  Do you think they lull them  To sleep and hack their head off  No no I'm not  Saying I'm an animal rights activist  They're so easy though  I know  I respect anyone  That hurts or fucks an animal  I just don't like somebody  That shoots it from 80 yards away  Walk right up to it  And fucking sodomize it  That's fine  Yeah this apparently  Was like a reserve  That's designed for hunting  They drive around  Get out of their car  Shoot  Oh yeah no he's famous  For going to those kind of reserves  That's where Dick Cheney likes to hunt 
[04:16:00]  Where they have like a billion birds  And they just release them all at once  I have no respect for those guys either  Not exactly Hemingway  On the plains of the Serengeti  Down in the line  He's not even Ted Nugent  With an arm bow  Yeah  But Nugent at least  Is a real guy  Like that's what his lifestyle is  He eats it  He fucking uses it  I have no problem with the real  Nugent's not a rich  Yeah I have no problem  With the real hunters  I have a problem with these guys  That go to these farms  Well that's what he is  And it's animals that are almost extinct  That they drug up  You know so you can go home  With your catch and brag  To all your friends 
[04:16:30]  Yeah  Fucking bearskin rug  What a disgrace  You can fuck your mediocre date  On the floor  With the fire going  You shitheads  Poor Steve  Anthony's a hunter  And Anthony owns a lot of guns  Great groups  Not a hunter  Listen  You're a hunter from the old days  It's legal to own guns  And it's legal to hunt  It's just that  Do you really think  Dick Cheney has the health  To like tramp through the woods  And hunt down an animal  Right  No they unleash  Like a billion things near him  He spins around  And you know  I got one  Hooray  Live action video game  I didn't mean to say  You did some hunting 
[04:17:00]  Back in the day  I hunted when I was a kid  When I was a teen  Out in California  Yeah I misspoke on that one  And I felt bad  You know I shot a little rabbit  And then I felt bad about it  Yeah  I haven't hunted  I could never hunt a deer  Or something like that  No  But I like  I enjoy shooting  I enjoy going to the range  And target shooting  I  It's like shooting darts  Or something  I like seeing if I could  Get a bullet  In the bullseye  It's fun to shoot guns  It's just  Part of what I enjoy  You think that's fun  You ain't hit  You ain't hit an elderly  Rich lawyer before 
[04:17:30]  Now that is  I can understand  How much fun that can be  You're talking about  Targets and shit  But when a white haired fellow  Wearing an orange vest  Comes toward you  Jumps up in front of you  You know what I'm saying  There's good times ahead  I'm Harry Whittington  I'm Whittington  Whittington  I'm sure it's the something  The third  The second  It's been many a year  Since the vice president  Has shot someone  202 years to be precise  Yes  And I just don't think  Mr. Whittington  Is going to be accorded  The same privilege  As Mr. Hamilton  I don't think there's going  To be a $7 bill  With his peppered senile face  On it in 10 years  And how did he know 
[04:18:00]  He was going to be a lawyer  That's a name  Where you could only be a lawyer  Like that guy  You know you're not going  To find a guy  Named like that  In a deli or something  A whoop  Making your sandwich  Hello Harry Whittington  The third  What will you have  What would you like  With your sandwich  Grey Poupon  It couldn't be more obvious  If his name is Harry  I hate blacks  Fucking sickly old wasp  Harry there are Mexicans  At the perimeter  Pile up more bags of money  Well you saw the lady  Who ran the ranch  The tight faced  Republican lady  Oh yeah yeah 
[04:18:30]  The story kept changing  Every 30 seconds  It was nothing at first  It was he had been peppered  With some shot  Happens all the time  Well I agree with you  That it was an accident  But I also disagree  That we all know  What happened  I don't think we know  What happened  That fucking all  I think they've done  Everything they can  To keep us from  Knowing what's happening  If it was that simple  Why are there 83  Different stories  This is more serious  Than Rashomon on this  And if it was really  Not a big deal  Why not talk to the cops  That night  Instead of  Listen about 8 o'clock  Tomorrow morning  After I've sobered up  And cleaned up some shit  You guys swing by 
[04:19:00]  And I'll give you a statement  How about that  That's true  And then his whole thing  That well I thought  It would be best  If the woman at the ranch  Handled this  I believe you're the second  Most powerful person  In the free world  Yeah  I think you can make  A couple of fucking calls  I think whenever  You commit a crime  And you wait  Hours and hours  And hours  Before going to the police  Much like Ted Kennedy  Yes  There you go  How about that one  The reason is  You are sobering up  Oh yeah  That's it  Yeah  I think he had to have had a few  He probably had a few  Blood alcohol level 
[04:19:30]  Yeah you don't want that  Coming out  We'll wait  I'll sober up  We'll give a report  Plus if we go by his story  He had a beer at lunch  Then he didn't go visit  Whittington in the hospital  He went back to the ranch  And fixed himself a cocktail  If you recall this  Yeah then he pounded down  Then had dinner  Then had lunch  The next day  Yeah  And then  Called Whittington at the hospital  So we're talking about  Three or four meals  And several drinks  Before the heart of human kindness  Got off this  Fat fucking hamster laden  Heart pumping ass  To get up and fucking call 
[04:20:00]  The guy that he shot in the face  By the way  Shooting a guy in the face  Is one of the worst days  In your life  Yeah  So I guess the day  Your daughter was a pie diver  That was the worst day  That day had to suck  The day you were sweating  Your fifth deferment  That was a fucked up day  The day your fourth bypass  You know  That was a touch and go day  Yeah we talked about that  I got Whittington in the seven slot here  Yeah  They had a lot of bad days  Yeah we talked about that  On the show  I was like  Can't you give the guy a break  And say it was the worst day  Yeah one of the worst  Right  The day that I accidentally shoot you  It's a shitty day 
[04:20:30]  But it's not the worst  It's up there  Yeah  Come on  Whittington I'm sure  That was the worst day  Listen the day I got my Lexus  Some fucker keyed it  Now that was a shitty day  That's a shitty day  Right  That's a fucking awful day  That is a shitty day  I'm gonna try this again guys  Gary in Indianapolis  I'm stupid  Gary what's up  Hey guys I just wanna say  This is fucking brilliant radio  Love Greg  Hey buddy  You guys  You need to be coming out here  In the Midwest more often  Uh who  Greg or  Greg  Yeah  No you guys are on

[04:21:30]  Or just good comics  It's like  A guy like Mark Maron  I agree with almost nothing he says  And yet he's still a really good comic  Because he's always being funny  Greg's always being funny  It's like  That's all you ask from a fucking comic  Is do your opinions  Whatever you got  Just be funny with it  If you can't be funny with it  Then you're fucking alternative  And preachy and boring  And the same with the conservative  Let's go to Georgia  Stephanie what's up  Hey guys  I cannot believe I got through  I'm so excited  Yeah so are we  I've been listening to you guys  You guys are my dirty little secret

[04:22:30]  I don't know if it  Are you proud of that  Well I mean  I'm always happy to be employed  You know maybe  Call me crazy  But I love in show business  Getting a check for working  I'm not  Is huge  With like kids  No I understand  I need to explain  I mean you know  Because you're  You have an intelligence about you  And that was a very simple thing  That's the only thing I'm getting at  I'm sure the popularity  And the paychecks are awesome  But  It's the  If you're over five  The show  You know the interest level 
[04:23:00]  Well I mean  Hey let's pave this area over here  And then let's build this thing here  I mean  If you're two  You're like  This is great  They're going to build a road  And if you're like five  Exactly  Okay they built the road  I'm done  Here's the deal  I'm out in Colorado  With my girlfriend's family  And they have very young children  And I'm sitting in the living room  Watching something like T2  Or just a movie that I'm really into  And when the kids start like perking up  Yeah  The show goes off 
[04:23:30]  And Bob the fucking builder goes in  And Bob  Bob the builder  Can we build it  Bob the builder  Yes we can  Yes we can  And I'm like  What happened to T2  What happened to T2  Look there's nothing wrong with a paycheck  It's just got to be depressing  When your fan base is blowing you  Because they're teething  I don't want to say they're young  Greg I gotta tell you  That I didn't  At first I did not know  It was you on the tape  It was my husband 
[04:24:00]  Who said  Oh my god  That's Greg  Proofs and voice  So it was  So how's that work out for you  Well identified  How's that work out for you financially right  That's okay  The best part is I go to England to record it  And people  Is that where they do it  People here say stuff like  Well couldn't they just record it down the line from here  And it's like  Yeah but you understand they're flying me to England  Go do this gig  Yeah but you could do it here  And you wouldn't have to go there  I like to go there  Because I want to get on the plane  And go to another country  Do you ever fly Virgin  I'm sorry 
[04:24:30]  Do you fly Virgin when you go there  No usually B.A.  But I have flown Virgin  Okay  Yeah  Do you ever slip in some anti-corporate messages  Or some liberal agenda shit  That Bob the Builder doesn't like  That he's building a building  That's going to house like Starbucks  It's fantastic  It's awesome for a building show  Because it is a very liberal show  They're always recycling and reusing everything  And they live in Sunflower Valley  Which is a self-perpetuating situation  Wonderful  It's never that they're building a nuclear power plant 
[04:25:00]  And it's never that they're tapping into an untapped  Deforesting for the lumber  No it's never  It's never  Hey look we've struck oil under Sunflower Valley  We better move the indigenous people  Come do it  It's never that  Bob is building a slaughterhouse  Yeah exactly  It's always a little more benign than that  Stephanie  Mind you it's two year olds  So they're not really ready to deal with the big issues  What's your favorite episode  What's your favorite episode Stephanie  Of Bob the Builder  I like the second half of the Sunflower Valley series 
[04:25:30]  Where they get the little trailer all set up for Wendy  Is that the one where Bob has to fire half his staff  Because they outsourced  To Mexico  No that's not the episode  That comes later on in the series  What's the episode where Bob had to fire the one Mexican  Who has taken a dump into his friend's lunchbox as a joke  Yeah  Let's go to Sherry in South Dakota  Bob's hard day  They all have very gay titles  Bob's crew unionizes  Bob's big toolbox of fun is the name of one of the videos 
[04:26:00]  Sherry was in love with Jim  Oh no  What happened  What happened  What happened  What happened  I have this huge huge crush on Jim  But now that you don't hunt  I don't know if we can get along  Why  First of all what do you look like  What do I look like  I have blue eyes  Are you a short bald Irish man  No  Girls that hunt are usually hot  I'm short  I don't know 
[04:26:30]  Watch Jim change his stance  The hotter you get  Absolutely  You're short and you have blue eyes  Right  Right  Well I'm 5'6  Alright 5'6  Uh huh  Yeah  I'm not terribly skinny  Hunting is for douchebags  I hate hunting  Hunting stinks  Why  Hunting is for dummies  Nothing worse than a cow shooting pheasants  Now Jim  Let's say she was 5'6 
[04:27:00]  115 pounds  Big boobs  Nice ass  You know what  Technically hunting does help cut down on deer overpopulation  Right  And as long as it's done safely  And it's fun  It can be very good  And there's a lot worse things you could be doing with your time  Sure  Sure you go  It's all about where my cock is going  Get that through your heads  Alright Sherry  Thanks Sherry  You have to remember though  You bend over a lot when you're deer hunting  Yeah I know that  And you get fucking Lyme disease  I don't need deer hunting  It's stupid  It's fucking things  Just trying to have some water in a leaf  Wants to have a berry  And there's some fucking 
[04:27:30]  Short fat broad  Shooting at it  Fucking  Leave the fucking thing alone  Why don't you  Minding his business  It really doesn't try to hurt anybody  Perhaps enjoying a juniper berry  He's got a bullet hitting his fucking  His back hind quarter  Jesus Christ  Go to the gym  The gym's a great place to hunt  Because everyone's stationary  You know  Yeah  They're just going up and down on the stairmaster  On a treadmill  How hard is that  They're not even really moving  God is that good 
[04:28:00]  Alright we gotta say goodbye to Greg Proofs  We're gonna take a break  Oh okay bye bye  Well they said you have to go to  Yeah I do  I gotta go to  Cold pizza  Why are you throwing Greg out  I don't throw Greg out  I like Greg  Hey everybody  This is your old pal Greg Proofs  The specky one  From whose line is it anyway  And you're listening to the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Hey it's Opie and Anthony  And this is the worst of Rich Voss  On the Opie and Anthony show  It's any Rich Voss  What did Danny say over there?

[04:29:00]  No this is  Headaches  Oh yeah  Blindness  Yeah blindness and headaches  If you  Blindness  When some people use the Viagra I guess  This is some  Now I'm thinking  I don't know  I'm thinking some kind of psychological thing  They give them to the little kid  Maybe to stop them from bed wetting  If he's got a rod all night  He won't be able to take a leak  Or something  If they fall out of bed  At night  You give them a Viagra  And it works like a kickstand  They can't roll over  Right  Fall out of bed  I don't know  Right  Or if you just want them to stay hard  Or yeah the obvious 
[04:29:30]  You just need an 8 year old  With a heart on  It turned out to be some lung disorder  Yeah some lung disease  They're giving Viagra to these kids  With a lung disease  Because it opens up  And helps them breathe  I think I can explain why  They're sporting wood though  I know  They're breathing great  But geez  What did I do with this thing  You're going to school  With a rod in your pants  Covering it up with your lunchbox  All embarrassed  That was a happy day  To last NAMBLA meeting

[04:33:00]  How you go from  Just sleepover  Where normal people  Just go to sleepover  You hang out  You watch TV  And then you go to sleep  Because we were like  15 or 16  And we never had a girl yet  So we probably thought  It was normal  Yeah  But what happened  Like did you go  Hey  Did you  Hey take your pants down  I want to show you something  Yeah  How does it start  Yeah  Thank you Bonnie  Come on  We'd be high  And then we would  Compare boners  Or something  You don't just compare boners  Like how did you get a boner

[04:35:00]  Right  You don't just all of a sudden  Start jerking off together  Like how many guys  Someone has to make the first move  And that's what I'm getting at here  What is that move  Even though you're saying  It's not gay  And what did you go for  Right  It's not  It's just got  Someone  One of you  Had to make what is called  The first move  Where you start going  You're assessing the situation  You're looking over going  I think he'll be into me jerking off  You're building this up in your head  How  Who made the first move  And how many people said no  Said no  And boss

[04:36:00]  I don't have any answers  The Farrah Fawcett  Wastebasket  Now the reason I'm asking this  Is because I had the similar experience  But I was in a tree fort  In California  With my friend Richard  And it was just like a sleep out  At the tree fort  And I was trying to go to sleep  And we had been drinking too  Of course  There's some kind of alcohol involved  And he leaned over  And he goes  I'll suck your cock

[04:37:30]  Dude  You're in the same bed  Dude  You're in the same bed  And when you're growing up  You don't get a big bed  Right  So I'm wondering  If there was somebody  That made believe  They were asleep  While you were jerking  Or perhaps  You didn't find his dick  Attractive enough  To jerk off with him  I want to know  What was going on  I guess we got  You know  We come back  We be high  Like at Mickey's  Well Brian's house  Maybe these guys  Don't want their names  On the radio  I don't know  Call me crazy 
[04:38:00]  But maybe you want to  Call them different names  They're somewhere in Jersey  Going will you  Shut the fuck up  So how did it go  I don't know  I guess Brian  I remember  Like you know  We'd go out  I remember we went out  One night  You know we'd just party  Because we didn't go to bars  We were too young  Sure  We're all blasted  And we come back  You know  I guess we're hanging  We're laying in the bed  And you know  Never had a girl  And you know  You just start talking about  Jerking off  Two guys 
[04:38:30]  Two guys  Just two men  Fat cox  Oil  You know  Do girls ever factor into it  At all  Like I mean  The idea of one  I will say  It is impossible  To like get girls  At certain times in your life  As a growing boy  Yeah  The possibility  Of getting a girl  That's going to do anything  To your dick  Is  It just isn't there  Well the first time  The first time  I was  But you could talk about it  You could talk about it  You could go  Did you see so and so  In gym class
