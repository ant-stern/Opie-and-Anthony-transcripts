<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with the hosts recounting their weekend experiences. Opie detailed his car troubles culminating in a new car purchase, and his frustration at hecklers at Jim Norton's stand-up show, including one who made a racist remark about Barack Obama. Anthony described his home improvements, including a new home theater and gun room, then shockingly revealed a shared past of cocaine use with his mother and Sal in the 1980s.  The Grammy Awards were briefly discussed, with commentary on the performances and winners, including Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, and a mention of the Chris Brown/Rihanna assault.

A substantial portion focused on Comic-Con.  The hosts detailed their encounters with celebrities such as William Katt (from *The Greatest American Hero*), Robert Culp (*I Spy*), the Honky Tonk Man, and Scott Steiner.  E-Rock's overly enthusiastic reaction to meeting William Katt was a major talking point. Intern Dave's awkward but memorable Comic-Con interviews with cosplayers (Joker, Scooby-Doo, Mario, Dick Tracy) were played, featuring his blunt and often insulting assessments. E-Rock's childhood obsession with *The Greatest American Hero*, including a claimed "flying" accident resulting in a scar, was also discussed. The show's theme song played repeatedly throughout this segment.

The steroid scandal involving A-Rod and the prevalence of steroid use in baseball were debated, with the hosts expressing a preference for "monsters" in sports regardless of health consequences.  A viral YouTube video of a drugged child at the dentist's office generated much laughter and discussion.  A significant portion covered Captain Sully Sullenberger's *60 Minutes* interview, with humorous commentary on Katie Couric's questioning and listener calls.  The state of local versus global news and the declining newspaper industry were also briefly touched upon.

The show then shifted to a critique of *Shawshank Redemption*'s portrayal of Brooks Hatlen, followed by a debate about Tim Burton's involvement in *The Nightmare Before Christmas*.  Mickey Rourke's allegedly obscene BAFTA acceptance speech was mentioned. The Pro Bowl received heavy criticism, with discussion of its unpopularity and player injury risks, including a caller providing an update on its future scheduling. Numerous "FU" line calls containing vulgar language were played.  Anthony's drinking habits were discussed, prompting a call from a self-described analyst attempting to understand his drinking patterns.  The Grammy Awards were revisited, focusing on winners and alleged plagiarism surrounding Coldplay's "Song of the Year" win. The hosts shared photos of their encounters with Robert Plant.  A discussion about misleading cigarette commercials and the use of doctors to endorse products (including Nathan's Hot Dogs) ensued, with callers sharing examples.  Past advertising, 1960s car safety, diet pill dangers, and the octuplets birth were also discussed, along with a caller's complaint about an offensive Oovoo commercial and another caller misinterpreting a comment about the octuplet mother.


The broadcast continued with a discussion about quitting smoking and the resulting anxiety, involving a caller named Deb and humorous, vulgar exchanges that escalated into insults and sexually suggestive remarks directed at Deb. A Beijing hotel fire was briefly mentioned.  Listener calls followed, including one about quitting marijuana, which prompted mockery from the hosts. A ProFlowers commercial break interrupted the show. A lengthy and crude discussion with guest Sam about a Dilbert comic strip, including sexually explicit and offensive jokes and audience participation in generating alternative endings, took place.  The show concluded with vulgar commentary on the appearance of the Flight 1549 crew shown in a news story about them receiving keys to the city, followed by a brief wrestling news update.  Finally, the hosts read and reacted to listener-submitted jokes, many of which contained sexually explicit and violent content, including a joke about rape.  They debated the jokes' "cleanliness" before abruptly ending the show with further explicit language, noting a large audience was present.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, yes. It must be Monday.  I don't even know where to begin. We got some really good stories from the weekend.  The weekend!  Are we allowed to talk about what we were talking about at your house, or do we have to have a little off-air discussion? 
[00:00:30]  That's fine. That was years ago.  That was amazing.  That was funny.  We can end the break with that.  Yeah.  Can I talk about my car experience real fast? Was that interesting enough to bring to everybody?  Well, as long as something has progressed, and it's not just you with your broken-down piece of crap again.  I'll do a quickie.  Friday, went and saw Jimmy at Caroline's. His new material, amazing. Amazing. 
[00:01:00]  A little shout-out to the fans that go to see Jimmy. Stop with the show references.  Please.  Is that what they did?  I know Jimmy's not going to say it, but stop. Really, just stop.  I know you mean well, and I know you're showing you're a big fan, but Jimmy's up there doing his thing, and he's got really good material,  and you're shutting him down by yelling out, just, Monster Rain!  There was one of those.  God, you hack.  There was one of those. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, God.  All of a sudden, all of a sudden, they just yell out, Uncle Paul!  And he's in the middle of this great animal rant.  Yeah.  I mean, his material on, you know, that, what was it?  Trunkus!  You got one of those.  And he's so patient.  He mentions Barack Obama, and then someone yells out,  He's half, he's only half black, you know!  Oh.  And Jimmy's like, yeah, yeah, great, but I'm in the middle of, like, showing you my brilliance, so I'm going to shut up.  Great if Jimmy just pulled a gun out and shot a heckler and just kept going. 
[00:02:00]  You don't understand how there's nothing I want more than for that to be my swan song in comedy.  So after the show, I go, Jimmy, when did that start?  And he goes, wow, they've been doing this for a while now.  Yeah.  So I have to be the bad guy.  Please.  No joke.  Bad guy, the voice of reason.  Knock it off, you dummies.  It's not about you.  If you're a big fan of Jim Norton and the radio show and you're going to see Jim, sit there and enjoy it,  because he's really trying to do some good stuff on that stage. 
[00:02:30]  And you don't throw him off because he's a veteran, but everyone else was, in my area, they start sighing, like,  Oh, my God, shut up.  And these are hardcore fans, too.  Like, yeah, we know the show, but, you know, he's doing some really good material that he's honed over the last few months for us.  What do they think?  Like, Jimmy's going to be standing there and go, yeah, come up on the stage with me.  It's a bizarre thing, because, like, that's why I learned to mention the show when I talk about the show.  Right. 
[00:03:00]  If I'm going to do it, I'll do it at the end, like in the last 10 minutes.  Right.  Because I've noticed, I've used to open it up early and say, hey, all the radio fans, and then it was just nonstop.  People yell, boardroom, Jimmy.  I did that twice in 1998.  But I appreciate it.  See, I've been a fan for a long time.  And in all fairness, they mean well.  Yeah.  But, like, I mean, Jimmy gets into a groove.  He's like, he is in the zone, and he's working this stuff that he wants to bring to everybody. 
[00:03:30]  And then someone goes, ah, frunkus.  Frunkus.  And you can see Jimmy wants to go skrangle somebody.  I'll frunkus your face, you dummy.  Right.  Let me do my show.  Especially because they're yelling it with four R's and eight R's.  And we can all hear the difference.  Wow, we all know.  Six R's.  I'm trying to remember some of the other references.  But you get the point.  And, you know, if you, I mean, because he's not going to say it.  You know, Jimmy's the nice guy here.  But, you know, do the right thing and try not to yell show references because Jimmy's new stuff is really, really good. 
[00:04:00]  They get a few drinks in them and just think that they're the funniest things in the room.  Right.  And they have to, like, get everybody's attention.  Look at me.  Right.  I listen to the show that the comedian is on.  I had to have a table thrown out on a Saturday late show in the front.  And I never liked to do that.  Yeah.  Because I think they were fans, but they were so disruptive.  And they were just drunk.  They weren't trying to be rude.  But the woman was yelling to me.  And, like, it was nonstop.  And when you look down at the table and you see them talking and high-fiving each other about things unrelated to the show, it's time to go. 
[00:04:30]  I apologize.  And I did leave without any problems.  You did.  And you weren't even high-fiving.  You were using your feet at that point.  You had far too much to bring.  But most of the people were just amazing and sat there and really enjoyed the comedy.  So, you're talking about, you know, a few people.  I mean, if you could.  I'm doing this for Jimmy today.  Please.  And Al Jackson was great.  And Amy Schumer was great. 
[00:05:00]  I mean, the-  Effin' Al Jackson.  I told him he's got to come on the show.  I like that guy.  Yeah.  So, I like that guy a lot.  And I like that female comic.  Amy.  Yeah, because we're all about hating the female comic.  But fair is fair, man.  She is funny.  Yeah, she's really funny.  And dirty.  Yeah.  I can't, you know, do her material justice.  But she's really, really funny.  She was on Last Comic Standing a couple years back.  I remember seeing her.  Yeah, I didn't even know her from that.  I just met her at the cell and I watched her and I'm like, oh, she's really funny, man.  She's very funny.  She's got something.  She's going to go places. 
[00:05:30]  So, then Saturday, my sister flies up from Florida and surprises everybody and gives me  a call like, hey, we're all doing dinner at FH Riley's, you know, my bro's restaurant,  whatever.  So, I'm like, yeah, cool.  We'll go out there.  So, I call down from my car because I live in a building and I get down there and they  go, you got a flat tire.  I go, no, no.  You see, I had a flat tire last week, which was a major hassle.  We fixed that.  Yeah.  No, new flat tire. 
[00:06:00]  I'm like, you're kidding me, right?  Sure enough, this tire was flat.  So, immediately, I took a picture and sent it out to all the followers on Twitter.  Well, you have to.  You took a picture of the first one.  You need a follow-up.  OP Radio on Twitter.  They got their second flat tire picture in a week.  And I was talking to people about Twitter all weekend long.  They're like, they're actually looking at pictures of your flat tires.  I'm like, yeah, they beat this stuff up. 
[00:06:30]  We were having that discussion last night.  Yep.  So, I sent off the flat tire picture and then I had some options.  I'm like, all right, what is the fastest way to fix this tire?  Triple A would be a nightmare.  What would that be?  An hour before they even show up possibly?  It takes forever.  Now, I'm in Manhattan.  Do I take the flat tire and throw it in the back of a cab and find somewhere to fix it,  then bring it back to the garage?  Hassle.  I'm all showered up.  I got a little cologne on.  I'm ready to go, right?  Yeah.  So, then I get the bright idea.  I'm like, okay, I still got the flat tire from last week in the back of the SUV. 
[00:07:00]  Not fixed?  No, I'm driving on the donut tire, which is a full-size tire in my car.  So, I'm like, all right, I will sacrifice one of the tires to get down to the gas station  to fix the other tire that's in the back of the SUV.  And then I can drive out to FH and not miss dinner.  So, that's what I did.  So, I get to the garage, which was like 20 blocks away, hit a bunch of horrendous potholes. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, you feel every bump when you're riding on the rim.  Yeah, it's like not having joints left or something.  What's this?  Like cartilage?  Yeah, the cartilage in between the joints.  You feel it.  Yeah, those tires, pretty important when it comes to hitting bumps.  You have no idea until you're going 30 miles an hour on pretty much a rim.  I mean, this thing couldn't be flatter.  And I pull in, and I was ready to say, believe it or not, which is so lame.  Believe it.  It was a Muslim dude that ran the garage, and he was really cool. 
[00:08:00]  So, he takes the tire off.  He goes, I can't fix this.  I mean, the rim is just destroyed.  I go, no, I know.  You keep that.  I sacrificed it.  Yeah, I sacrificed that.  I got another tire.  And to make a long story short, he fixed that.  I go, are you sure this is going to get me out to Long Island and back?  He goes, you could drive to Chicago.  That's it?  No further?  He goes, you could drive to Chicago, and I debated.  Maybe I should just drive to Chicago for the next couple of days. 
[00:08:30]  See if he's right.  And test it out.  So, then, you know, just looking at my wife all the way out to Huntington.  With her blanket on?  And I had, yeah, with her blanket on, if you've been following this, yes.  And I'm just looking at her, and I just ran out of excuses, ran out of things to say.  I couldn't spin it at all.  So, I got up yesterday, and I just left her in bed, and I took off, and I bought a new car. 
[00:09:00]  Yay!  Bought a new car.  Finally.  It came down to two flat tires in a week.  Jesus.  Bought a new car.  Which I, because then I took a picture of me in the tunnel that you always talk about under the East River for the people on Twitter.  Uh-huh.  And they're like, that's not your new car.  I thought, did they have to get it all, you know, they got to get the plates and the insurance, and they got to, like, you know, make it all nice.  Yeah.  So, I get it in a couple days, so I'm really happy.  Look at you.  You do know that photography inside the tunnels is illegal. 
[00:09:30]  Is that one a bad one?  Well.  That's a cool picture, though.  Look at that.  It is cool.  Wow.  It's not allowed.  For real?  Yeah.  There's signs that say no photography.  Oh, no.  They're afraid, you know, terrorists are going to be scoping it out and taking pictures of.  Well, they're taking pictures of me.  I'm going to take pictures of them.  Yes.  Well, that was coming home from your joint.  I think you'll be all right.  I stopped by Ann's just to say hi and see this theater that he's putting in in the basement. 
[00:10:00]  I literally started weeping.  Why weeping?  Because it's safe to say, and I, you know, we are equal.  Yes.  We are equal partners in this, meaning we financially are equal.  Yes.  And to see what he gets for his money and what I get for my money, I was, Sal was there with  Ann's mom.  Sal and Roe.  And at one point, I think I was weeping on Sal's shoulder.  Weeping. 
[00:10:30]  It's okay, Opie.  I'm trying to spin how cool it is to live in New York.  Look, he's showing me where his, like, little wine cellar is going.  He's going to have a little walk-in wine cellar, and I enjoy my wine.  And this is where the full-size nine-, ten-person poker table is going to go, and we're going  to put a bar over here.  Bar.  And then he showed me the theater.  And Sal even's like, if you're depressed now, just wait until you see the theater. 
[00:11:00]  I walked in.  He's got a movie theater in his house.  Yeah.  That's what it comes down to.  Some people get, like, they do a home theater thing in their living room or something like  that with a sound system and everything.  It's home theater.  Right.  I wanted an actual movie theater in my house.  So that's what I went for.  Yeah.  A movie theater.  Now, just picture your local movie theater, one of the nicer ones.  Yes.  And then just shrink it down.  Shrink it down.  That's all white people.  Yes. 
[00:11:30]  No disruptive cell phones and yelling.  And I won't have to worry about getting anyone in battle mode if my girl perks up and says  something.  Shrink it down to a theater that fits probably about 20 people, but the screen stays the  same.  I've got to have huge.  More or less.  The screen is huge.  Big-ass screen.  Has little stairs, so you go up to your little seat.  Yeah, there's the little stairs along the side aisles and little pin lights that come  down on the stairs.  That's cool, man.  There's sconces. 
[00:12:00]  Sconces.  Very art deco.  I have the whole thing looking very, very retro, art deco looking with the colors and the  lighting and everything.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  It's a lot.  I'm so psyched to get this done.  Wait, the seats are in?  A few of the seats are in now.  I actually got that on my Facebook.  I put a few of the pictures up there of the theater, the walls, the seats.  Half the seats are in right now.  And they're big, cushy reclining, electric recliners. 
[00:12:30]  Really?  So they all can just tip back.  A couple of the seats don't have armrests.  So they're like love seats.  So if you're there with your chick, you know, you could just kind of hang out.  I want to come watch a movie.  Oh, yes.  I'm going to have a huge premiere party where, yeah, everybody come over, watch a movie.  I should say the seats are better than movie theater seats.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're bigger, more comfortable.  There they are.  There's the seats. 
[00:13:00]  If you go to Anthony's Facebook, you can see some nice pictures of the theater.  It's just ridiculous.  And I came back to the city kind of sad.  Walked into, you know, I got three, four-bedroom apartments.  Nice, but.  I'm achieving my goal of never having to leave my house.  Oh, yeah, I forgot.  He's got a room dedicated to audio video, Jimmy.  Yes.  He's doing video blogs.  So I have, yeah, I have a studio room.  He's going to have a full studio down there.  For audio and videos because I want to start doing video casts right from my little studio downstairs. 
[00:13:30]  I think that will be a fun thing to do.  Just get on, ten minutes of the clip, just pop on, have some fun.  And then the movie theater and the gun closet.  The gun closet.  Dude, I saw, last time I was there, I thought he had impressive, like, weaponry, let's say.  He showed me stuff.  I don't even know how you would, I don't even know how you hold it.  I have no idea.  You've got to see some of this stuff. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, just look it up.  All legal.  Oh, yeah.  I'm legal, legal eagle.  Barely legal.  You got barely legal.  The girls, that's what I'm getting at.  Barely legal girls, barely.  Barely legal.  And barely legal guns.  That's how you roll.  They make it through.  And then we're sitting at the table.  It was me, you, and Sal, and your mom.  Mom and Sal, yeah.  And then all of a sudden you guys, I'm not saying this. 
[00:14:30]  We were talking about the old days, back in the 80s.  I'm just here to remind you.  I'm not going to be the one that says this.  Everyone was partying, having fun.  So when Sal had his boat, we used to go out to Watch Hill out there on Fire Island and the Oyster Fests and Cow Harbor Day in Northport on Long Island, if you're a local person around here.  And we started talking about how we used to party back then.  I thought I knew Anthony. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  I've heard the stories over the years, but Jimmy, listen to this.  So we just started talking about how we would just snort cocaine as a family.  We would all just buy coke from my old boss.  Well, they're talking about this, and then I kind of made the connection.  I go, wait a minute.  I go, I call Aunt's mom, mom.  Yeah.  And I go, wait.  Wait a minute.  You used to do coke with Aunt.  Oh, it was family. 
[00:15:30]  It was way back.  Way back.  You know, everyone was doing it back then.  So, yeah, we'd go, like, into Northport and go on the boat and then just, you know, hey, could you grab an eight ball from, you know, and then you mentioned my old boss.  Yeah.  And, you know, we'd get some and just, we'd be snorting coke.  Together.  Jimmy.  Mom, Sal.  Jesus, really?  Joe.  Thank you.  That was my reaction.  Yeah.  I don't know many people that did coke with their mom and dad.  It was fun. 
[00:16:00]  That's what your mom's saying.  Look, we're all family.  And then we all said, you know, we all realized pretty much at the same time, eh, this probably isn't very good for you.  So, we just stopped doing it.  And then they were talking about, like, where they lost some.  Yeah, yeah.  And the ceiling tiles.  And I'm like, look, you didn't lose that.  Someone took that.  You do know.  Someone stole the coke.  You do know that, right?  You never lose coke.  Never.  People steal it.  Never.  Never.  Yeah, that was, uh...  And then at that point, I'm like, I gotta go home.  This is...  I don't want to know what else you guys did together. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, it was just, uh, you know, sort of a little blow.  I did get a good laugh because we were getting a little tour of the house again.  Every time I go over, I get to the latest tour.  And, uh...  And Sal saw your shower.  He's like, you can get four people in there.  And, coincidentally, there was four of us.  I'm like, come on, Sal.  Hey, come on, Sal.  Let's go.  Which has brought up some just horrendous scenario.  Oh, God, dude.  No.  Just...  I'll stop at the coke.  Right.  That's pretty much, uh, where it all ended. 
[00:17:00]  Just horrific scenarios, uh, popped into everyone's head.  And we awkwardly left the bathroom and continued on the tour.  Yeah.  That was back in, you know, mid-80s.  No, I understand.  It was a while ago.  Early mid-80s.  That's not the point, though.  That's a weird one.  It was.  It was fun, though.  Trying to think what was the wildest thing I did with my parents.  I think I had beers with my dad.  We'll be talking nonsense, grinding our teeth.  All right, we've got to take our first break. 
[00:17:30]  Fun.  Danny, you got that song just to tease what we're going to do right after the break?  It's too good to wait on.  We'll talk Grammys and all that crap and Sully.  Sully's, uh...  Sully's all over.  So, we're going to be sick of Sully by, uh, tomorrow.  For real.  Unless there's another plane.  Well, he did his interview last night with Katie Couric.  He's getting the key to the city, and, uh, he's going to be on Letterman.  He's doing the whole thing today and tomorrow, so.  And good news, Pink Panther 2?  Bombed! 
[00:18:00]  Did it?  Bombed!  Wow.  I think it was on fourth.  It came in fourth.  Ooh.  What came ahead?  Even Taken did better, and it's second week out.  Wow.  Second week?  Second week for Taken beat out Pink Panther 2.  Oh, good.  That chick flick, uh...  My girl went and saw it by herself.  She goes, you want to go?  I'm like, no effing way.  Ooh.  Which one?  He's just not that into you.  Oh, oh.  And she came...  No, she came home, she's like, I don't understand what the big deal with this movie is.  I sat there, like, just frustrated, and with my arms folded, while all the bitches, because 
[00:18:30]  there was a theater filled with bitches, were just laughing it up, thinking it was the funniest  thing ever.  Oh.  So I know I'm with the right woman, because she's like, I thought I was stupid.  I'm like, all right, right on.  So she passed the test.  By the way, someone's like, you finally get a new car after two flat tires, Danny, in  Pennsylvania.  That's great, Ope.  Your wife could freeze her ass off, and that's okay, but a couple of flat tires, and then  you get a new car. 
[00:19:00]  Now Ope's inconvenienced.  And we were talking about Facebook and Twitter.  I have a warning to Big A.  Uh-oh.  Big A is a microblogger, and if he doesn't stop microblogging, you're out.  I don't follow you anymore.  What happens when he microblogs?  I'm learning, dude.  I'm learning.  The latest craze is everyone is doing this blogging thing, but you never want to be a  microblogger.  That means you're doing too many updates. 
[00:19:30]  Is that constant, worthless little snippets that nobody gives a crap about?  Yeah, the news is doing something about, are you updating your status too much, things  like that.  That's what microblogging is.  Okay.  That is the word of the day, or the phrase of the day, microblogging.  Walk into class, at class.  Right, right.  Open a book.  Right.  There's a fine balance.  If you update too much, I do it all the time.  I had a bell on ronandfez.net because they were microblogging.  Like, they were filling up everything with updates every 15 minutes. 
[00:20:00]  I'm like, you got to go.  It's got to be a balance.  Yeah.  No when to update.  And Big A is heading toward a big beat it.  Beat it, stupid.  What could be happening in his life that he's microblogging?  People are under this illusion that they're interesting enough to, reality TV has told  people to lie.  Right.  That their every move is fascinating and watchable.  Yeah.  And it's not.  Right.  It's not.  My, I update my Facebook status and it's usually one of three things at any given time. 
[00:20:30]  I'm going to sleep.  I'm drinking.  I'm doing the radio show.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  All at the same time.  Yes.  All at the same time.  So, Big A, you're a microblogger and you're at risk of being dumped by me.  Well, someone suggested, are these some of his?  Kidnapped a chick, hit her in the head, watched TV.  That's funny. 
[00:21:00]  Is he doing that?  Cut off her legs.  Ain't deserved it.  Cleaned blood out of fingernails.  Enjoyed my cobbler.  Enjoyed.  Hey, go back there.  Go back there, Danny, please.  Yeah, go up.  This is Big A's microblogging.  Good afternoon and see you there, whatever that means.  Yes, I have it.  I don't have to be out in New Jersey at least 8 p.m.  so I have time to rest.  And then he uses the F word for gay, but in good company.  Good morning, Bill Adonis. 
[00:21:30]  Good afternoon.  I just got up and went to bed about 3 or 4 a.m.  Hugs to my sick sweet pea.  I'm home and Jimmy's show is very good.  And a solid show.  Well, that's a good one.  Al Jackson and Amy Schumer and our own Ye and Me.  So that's like a good update right there.  The rest of the ones I just read.  Useless.  Useless.  Exactly.  No one cares.  So, all right, we should take a break.  You got that song, Danny, as we go to break?  Hold on.  I'm updating.  Taking a break.  Send.  Send.  Uh, yeah. 
[00:22:00]  Give me a little piece of that.  Ah, yes.  Okay.  Dude, we heard a story.  Why?  It went on the air.  Why would this music be pertinent today?  Right.  We'll let you know.  Right after these messages.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's a good one.  How's everybody this morning?  I hear voices, so I have to ask questions like that. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Good morning to you and yours.  I'll be on Monday, though.  You have such a nice weekend.  Friday seems like it just happened.  And then before you know it, it's Monday.  Bye.  Ah, I feel pretty good.  You watched the Grammys last night after I left?  No.  What a bore fest.  I went, like, right to bed.  I gotta tell you, I'm a big U2 fan.  Their new song, I'm not stealing.  Yeah.  And then you got Coldplay looking and sounding like the new U2, making U2's... 
[00:23:00]  Not really.  Coldplay, much more impressive than U2 at this point.  Wow.  Yeah.  And when Coldplay first hit, the problem with that band was that everything's kind of  sound the same because it was Chris Martin's vocals.  But they finally figured out how to make themselves more interesting musically.  Uh-huh.  Some people would argue that point, but that's kind of how I see it.  They really upped their sound.  And then Robert Plant won everything with that broad again. 
[00:23:30]  What the hell?  And we tried.  We listened.  It's obviously not for us, but...  No.  Uh, Alison Cross, they won everything.  They won, like, Wreck of the Year, Song of the Year.  He's just, like, doing sort of a folk thing with this, uh, this Alison Cross.  And we've tried to listen to the songs on the radio, and they're just...  It's good for him that he's doing something different, I guess, but...  I don't know.  And you heard about Chris Brown, right?  What did he do?  Well, they're hinting that he might have beat the living crap out of his, his, uh, chick, 
[00:24:00]  Rihanna, you know, Hinting, Rihanna, Rihanna did what, Umbrella and, and, uh, hold on there,  yeah, go ahead.  She was nominated for Disturbia as well, but, uh, both of them were supposed to perform,  and both of them pulled out at the last minute, less than three hours before the broadcast.  Yeah.  Uh, Chris Brown actually had to surrender to the police, because he was a wanted man on a,  uh, I think they said felony domestic abuse.  Felony domestic.  Yeah, but they did not name the woman. 
[00:24:30]  And Rihanna was reported to be, uh, leaving a hospital.  Yeah.  After treatment.  Wow.  So it's kind of all coming together like there might have been a, a problem.  I got beat up by my fella.  Fella.  Fella.  Wow, there you go.  Wow, man.  And how, I, who was this guy?  Let me see his picture.  Is it Chris Brown?  Yeah, he's...  Big guy?  He's, he's...  Not really. 
[00:25:00]  He's more of a dancer.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's actually quite talented.  Yeah, why is he talented?  He can sing and dance.  All right, name one song he does.  I don't know.  Exactly.  Oh, there you go.  Exactly.  But I've seen him dance.  Jesus.  So, that, that story is, uh, developing.  What a douche.  Trying to think what else about the Grammys that, um, that matters to anybody out there.  Eh, we'll go back to Grammy talk in a minute.  You want to get into the, uh, into the Comic Con?  Yes.  This is, uh, this is what I want to talk about. 
[00:25:30]  Can you hit that song again, Danny?  And I think at this point, Sam needs to bring in his, uh, his, his guy there.  Yeah.  Intern Dave.  David, our executive intern.  Oh, was he a scream on Friday?  And Sam is his handler.  Right, Sam?  Yeah.  All right, tells him where to sit and everything.  This is like, kind of like a wrestling thing.  He still has his laminate on.  Why do you still have your laminate on from Comic Con? 
[00:26:00]  What's this?  Oh, okay, good.  Everybody.  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  He's singing along.  By the way, good for Christian Bell.  He, uh, he apologized for his rant and basically said, look, make, make fun of me. 
[00:26:30]  I was an idiot, right?  He's pretty much saying, I was an idiot, do what you have to, make fun of me, whatever.  Yeah.  I'll get through this, but I was wrong.  He wasn't wrong.  He's saying he was wrong.  He's totally right.  Oh, Kevin and Bean got the freaking exclusive with Christian Bell?  Mother effers.  Where are they located?  They're L.A. dudes, huh?  We met one of these guys.  They came to New York.  They couldn't have been nicer.  I don't think I've ever, I've heard their show maybe a few minutes here and there when 
[00:27:00]  I was in L.A., but this is Christian Bell and Kevin and Bean.  We'll get to you guys in a second.  I have no confusion whatsoever.  I was out of order beyond belief.  I was way out of order.  I acted like a punk.  I regret that.  And there is nobody that has heard that tape that is hit harder by it than me.  So I make no excuses for it.  It is inexcusable.  And I hope that that is absolutely clear. 
[00:27:30]  You know?  I think that.  One thing that has really disturbed me throughout this, because I'm just, I'm not familiar,  I'm not comfortable yet with this notion of being a movie star.  I've always, I'm an actor, and I don't quite know how to handle the movie star thing.  And the thing that disturbs me so much is that I've heard a lot of people saying that  I seem to think I'm better than anybody else.  And nothing could be farther from the truth.  I am a lucky, I don't want to swear, I'm a lucky movie. 
[00:28:00]  That's what I do.  I never forget that.  And that is why I put so much into what I do, and why I care so much about it, and why  sometimes that enthusiasm just goes awry.  You know?  And please, if anybody ever sees that I really am thinking that I'm better than anybody else,  stick a fork in my backside.  Yes.  Turn me over. 
[00:28:30]  I will be done.  That is not me.  You know?  How about you let someone else talk, Christian Bale?  I like how he's just avoiding using any kind of profanity, yet he just unloaded.  Yeah.  I was full of gumdrops.  Good one.  Good for him.  Why can't we get the big freaking, you know, exclusives?  We never get the exclusive.  Because we're dicks, Oak.  Yeah.  Is that it, you think?  Yes.  All we have to do is be nicer?  He would call up. 
[00:29:00]  Oak would be like, so, what happened?  Yeah.  Dialed someone.  Well, I remember a click.  Uh-huh.  And we'd laugh.  Yeah.  We probably could have had the exclusive many times, but we had to just, you know, make  ourselves laugh.  Yeah.  Ruin it.  All right.  Well, the callers would start calling in to support him, and they'd probably be like  doing whatever noises.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  We would just start playing all the clips of him yelling. 
[00:29:30]  I don't want to argue with myself.  All right.  A-Rod's all over the TVs.  Every TV.  A-Rod?  A-Rod.  Oh, that's different.  One of the rags is calling him A-Hole right on the front page today.  Really?  Yeah.  We'll get into it in a few minutes.  But first, Sam, you brought intern David to Comic-Con.  Yeah.  We got to spend Saturday afternoon together at the New York Comic-Con.  Oh, that's sweet.  How did that go?  It was great.  It was me and David and my girlfriend.  And she was psyched, not only to go to Comic-Con, but to get to spend the afternoon with David. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  Oh, gosh.  How much does she hate you?  No, she had fun.  And what we did was, David noticed that everybody was coming in costumes and stuff.  He thought there would be more celebrities there.  Yeah.  I would be very angry if I went to a Comic-Con and there weren't a lot of celebrities.  But there never really are that many.  At the New York Comic-Con, there's a bunch of artists and stuff.  But there aren't really...  I mean, I met the Honky Tonk Man.  No way.  The Honky Tonk Man was there?  Yes.  Yes.  I remember the Honky Tonk Man.  Wow. 
[00:30:30]  The Honky Tonk Man.  Kind of did the Elvis thing.  Yeah.  Before he wrestled.  But other than that, I mean, there wasn't...  No, like, people from the original cast of Lost in Space or anything like that?  Like Penny?  No.  Lou Ferrigno is always there.  Lou Ferrigno?  Okay.  Now you're talking celebrities, though.  This is what...  Was he the biggest...  This is the meat and potatoes of it.  Was he the biggest celebrity there?  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, there was nobody really worth waiting on line for, except Honky Tonk Man.  Yeah.  What do you do with Lou Ferrigno?  Jello shots out of his ears? 
[00:31:00]  His line is really long, but it's just people going, Lou.  Lou.  Lou, could you sign this?  Lou.  So, and she just walk around like the Verizon Man.  Poor Lou.  Lou.  Aw.  All right, we're going to do a two-parter.  The big story about that...  What's that song again?  Great American...  Greatest American Hero.  Greatest American Hero, yeah.  Ah, yes.  That'll be after the break, but first...  Yes.  Yes.  So what we did was, instead, I had him talk to... 
[00:31:30]  Because he made an observation that so many people come to these conventions in costumes.  Right.  Now, what type of costumes?  It's of their favorite heroes and characters.  From comic books and TV shows and things like that?  And the like, yeah, geek culture.  Yes.  Nice.  And I had David kind of interview them and make observations about their costumes.  Okay.  Just because, you know, it'd be good, because David's just your typical average Joe.  Oh, he certainly is.  You know?  Well, not average Joe. 
[00:32:00]  You like that, David?  Yes, David.  You get a little chuckle.  And so, as you can see, David was very proud of his press pass that he's still wearing today.  Yes.  You're still wearing that thing, huh?  It's the lamest press pass ever, though.  Yep.  It's just got his name on it.  No.  That's like one step above just a yellow Star of David on your shirt.  No, no, no.  It's not even my correct name.  My name is spelled incorrectly on the press badge.  Is it?  Yes.  What's fault is that?  I don't know.  Someone, whoever gave in the names. 
[00:32:30]  Steve.  Ah, yes.  All right.  Let's start with the Inter David Talks of the Joker and Rates' Impression.  Well, that's the Joker.  Some dude is just dressed as the Joker.  Everybody, the new thing at these Comic Cons is that everybody has to come as Heath Ledger  as the Joker, the Heath Ledger Joker.  Oh, no.  I mean, all those coffins coming through.  Oh, God.  There are like hundreds of them all dressed up as the new Joker.  Really?  Yeah.  The best part, I bet you every single person thought they were going to be the only one.  Yeah, they thought they'd have the cool, like, nobody else is going to spray their hair green. 
[00:33:00]  Like, no one's going to be dressed as Sully this holiday.  We've got a good idea.  Then you go to the party, just find all those Sully's.  Five guys with cheesy mustaches and damn holes.  Yeah.  Of course that's going to be, like, one of the more popular ones.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's start with this.  Hello.  This is Inter David at the Comic Con Festival at the Jacob Javin Center.  And we're here with the Joker today.  How are you today, Joker?  I'm just fine.  You know, trying to cause a little anarchy here, here and there. 
[00:33:30]  What qualifies you as the best Joker amongst all the Jokers in this convention today?  It's an interesting question.  Probably because I can do the voice.  No, you can't.  I do.  Oh, God.  I just got such douche chills.  Is that the guy?  Yes.  That's an awful.  Are these pictures up on a way?  That's awful makeup.  He should call himself the Jacker, because that's what he is.  It's horrid.  Dude, he doesn't do the voice.  Anarchy.  No.  Anarchy. 
[00:34:00]  And his makeup is awful.  It really is bad.  Well, David gave him a fair assessment.  Since David was face-to-face, you know, six inches away from him, he decided to give  the fair assessment of the impression.  All right.  And the pictures are up on onaradio.com.  The voice.  Nobody else can.  Can you do the voice?  I'll do it for you right now.  You see.  Meh.  To them.  Muggsy.  I'm just a freak.  And they're all normal. 
[00:34:30]  You see.  That's about it.  That's all I got for you.  That's the best you can do.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  You rule.  He just started laughing.  He's saying, that's terrible.  That's terrible.  Dave is nice.  Called him out.  Right to his face, Dave.  Yep.  I like that.  See, because all these guys in costumes, like, every, like, internet blog and every  place goes and interviews people at Comic-Con, and they all have cute stories on, like,  everybody who's in costume gets interviewed for these puff pieces. 
[00:35:00]  So they're all like, yeah, I'm the Joker, blah, blah, blah.  And then Dave comes along and says, no, you're kind of, it's terrible.  You're terrible.  You think it was a good impression?  No, it wasn't good at all.  It was horrible.  And the guy just slumped away, all dejected.  Well, no, he thought he could survive.  He thought he was just part of the joke.  So then David decided to tell him what he thought of his costume.  Oh, my God.  That's probably better.  What about your costume?  What about my costume?  You think your costume was better than all the other Jokers? 
[00:35:30]  Yes, I do.  I don't think so.  Your costume's not looking too good.  Why?  Why?  What do you think of the costume?  His costume was terrible.  I could have done a better job on that costume.  All right.  All right.  Thank you so much.  He got mad.  He had to skulk away.  Wait, he said wrap it up?  No, I told him.  Because the kid, at that point, he's just kind of standing there.  All depressed.  Giving us the, all right, just like moving around.  David doesn't know when to wrap it up.  That's true.  Well, you know what?  You should let him go.  I don't know. 
[00:36:00]  Well, we got, there's more.  All right.  David talks to Scooby-Doo?  Yes, David found Scooby-Doo.  And Scooby-Doo sits and takes it while David insults him for a minute.  Well, Scooby-Doo happened to be a six-foot-four black man with glasses and a Scooby-Doo outfit.  Oh, boy.  He was wearing a Scooby-Doo, like what, almost like a mascot-type outfit?  Yeah, and it was one of those masks where, like, the Scooby-Doo head sits on top of his head so you can see his face through where the neck is. 
[00:36:30]  That's the dumbest masks ever.  Yeah, this guy was.  He's not 6'4", by the way.  I'm looking at the pictures on onaradio.com.  The black guy is as tall as you, Sam, but then the head on top of his head makes him 6'4".  He's some big nerdy black guy with glasses and a Scooby-Doo costume.  Look at him.  He looks like Chris Rock.  His face is coming out of Scooby-Doo's neck.  That's not Scooby-Doo.  Horrible.  I hate those costumes where the head is on top of the guy's head.  There was also a one-piece costume that was too small, like, his torso was too long, so there was just a huge bulge. 
[00:37:00]  Like, he came up, he had a male.  David refused to mention it, but he had a...  Oh, he should have.  How do you say costume?  Costume.  Costume.  What's wrong with that?  It's probably the right way to say it, but...  Costume.  Most people alive say costume.  No, costume.  Costume.  Do you say...  Costume.  Do you say schedule, too?  Schedule.  Schedule.  Costume.  Costume.  Costume.  Costume.  Why do you say it?  Costume.  Costume.  Because with the T and the U, costume. 
[00:37:30]  Put the costume on, it's terrible.  I think it might be the proper way to say it, but it just doesn't sound right.  All right, here's Intern David just talking about Scooby-Doo.  Hello, this is Intern David.  We're here at the 2009 Comic-Con Festival, and who do we have with us today?  Ruby-dooby-doo?  Oh, wow.  It's Ruby-dooby-doo?  Oof.  Oh, my God.  Why is it Ruby-dooby-doo?  He's a dog, so, you know.  Ruby-doo. 
[00:38:00]  Why Ruby?  Yeah.  Did they ever do Ruby and Scooby-Doo?  Scooby-Doo kind of, you know, when he said it, was a little weird, but he didn't say  Ruby.  He definitely didn't.  And who do we have with us today?  Ruby-dooby-doo!  Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  You don't look so much like Scooby-Doo to me.  I mean, what's that weird voice that you got going on there?  It's kind of weird.  Is that how you normally talk?  Well, no, this is how I normally talk.  Hey, ladies.  But when I come to Comic-Con, I'm Scooby-Doo-Bee-Doo! 
[00:38:30]  Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  Why do you keep laughing like that, like with a little nerdy giggle?  What's that all about?  Well, let's say I've had some Scooby snacks earlier, if you know what I mean.  No, I don't know what you mean.  That doesn't sound anything like Scooby-Doo.  You've never seen my cartoon.  What cartoon do you have?  Rooby-Doo.  Rooby-Doo, where are you?  Rooby-dooby-doo.  Do you have nerdy-looking guys in glasses have cartoons?  Well, not me, but personally.  It's a cartoon I'm wearing.  I've never seen a nerdy Scooby-Doo before. 
[00:39:00]  Now you have.  That's what you see at Comic-Con.  The balls on this kid.  Then again, you're dealing with just nerds.  You act like he's calling out Chuck Liddell.  Calling out a black-retarded guy in a Scooby outfit.  A Ruby-Doo.  They all just walk around with their costumes and they play the part.  Yes, they do.  Yes, all of them.  This is an embarrassment.  They ought to just torch the building when all these people are in there.  Are you embarrassed for them?  I am so embarrassed for this guy.  What part got you? 
[00:39:30]  The part where the Ruby-Doo was bad,  but then when he tried to just talk off the cuff, off script,  in the voice, he just can't do it.  Hey, lady.  The Scooby snack lie was pretty funny.  Oh, was that hysterical?  My favorite was when he goes,  if you know what I mean,  and then Davey goes,  no, I have no idea what you mean.  Davey's very energetic.  Unbelievable.  All right, then you guys moved on to Mario.  Yes, Super Mario was there.  No way.  In the flesh. 
[00:40:00]  Ah, I see the picture on onaradio.com.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Track is that there, right.  Hold on a minute.  Intern David at Comic-Con.  Hello, this is Intern David at the Comic-Con convention  at the Jacob Javits Center,  and we're here with Mario.  How are you today, Mario?  Very good.  What kind of a costume are you wearing right now?  I'm wearing overalls, boots, gloves,  a Mario hat with the M on it,  mustache, and the shirt, the red shirt.  Wait, what did you just say? 
[00:40:30]  What's that thing on your upper lip that I see?  It's a mustache.  You think that's a real mustache?  Yeah, it's a real mustache.  What's so real about it?  It looks kind of fake to me, don't you think?  Okay, yeah, it's fake.  That's what I thought.  It is fake.  It's just...  He's a journalist.  He's getting to the bottom of things.  He wants Mario to finally admit  that is a fake mustache.  It's not a real Mario.  It's five inches wide  and a foot long on his face.  It's made of felt.  Yeah, made of felt, was it? 
[00:41:00]  Yes, yes.  What about the rest of your outfit?  You think that's a really good Mario costume?  It's all right.  It fits.  It's better than everybody else's.  What makes it better?  I've seen some other Mario's one  hopping and jumping around here.  I think there's a better.  Well, what do you want me to do about it?  Maybe we should go make a better Mario costume.  I mean, you have an M stitched onto your hat like that.  You didn't get a real hat with a real M on.  You have to stitch your own M on your hat?  Well, it's better than your costume. 
[00:41:30]  You don't have anything on.  I'm not trying to be anyone.  I'm just trying to be a regular,  ordinary person from a radio station reporting.  That's all.  All right, I'm done.  Thanks so much, Mario.  Thanks so much, Mario.  They back down pretty easily, don't they?  Yes, they do.  Yeah.  They just get all depressed.  You won't find one set of balls  on any of these guys, huh?  It's their big day at Comic-Con.  David's just blowing up their spot.  And they get all excited  because they think it's going to be  like a little puff piece  where they get to stay in character 
[00:42:00]  and be like,  we're here with Mario.  Yeah.  And David just smashes them.  We got one more there, Sam.  This is my favorite moment  of the entire weekend.  Oh, good.  Maybe of the year so far.  Yeah.  David talking to Dick Tracy.  Yep.  This is intern David  live at the 2009 Comic-Con Festival.  And who do we have with us today?  I'm Detective Dick Tracy.  You are?  What's this costume  that you have on here?  This costume is a vest,  this yellow beautiful coat  in my snap-pim fedora. 
[00:42:30]  Wait, so you're telling me  you're dressed up as Dick Tracy.  Is that correct?  Yes.  You look nothing like Dick Tracy.  What are you talking about?  Hey, I got the Tommy gun, pal.  Don't mess with me.  What's with that gun?  You made that out of cardboard and wood.  That's a big gun.  How come that hurt me?  Oh, um,  it doesn't shoot,  but, uh,  this is real.  Get my trip?  No, I have no clue.  No.  So what's up? 
[00:43:00]  I'm still,  I'm still trying to figure out  your costume.  You don't look anything  like Dick Tracy to me.  I think Dick Tracy  was a lot skinnier than that.  Oh!  He just turns around.  And then that guy just,  I've never seen someone  so quickly just turn around.  He said,  goodbye,  and just turned around.  He is a fat Dick Tracy.  Yeah, he really is.  I said,  oh,  you don't look so,  you look fat.  You're not a skinny Dick Tracy.  And he walked away like,  goodbye.  Yeah,  we laughed over.  Listen to the last second.  I think he said,  I'm like,  I'm done.  Yeah,  listen.  So what's up?  I'm still,  I'm still trying to figure out 
[00:43:30]  your costume.  You don't look anything  like Dick Tracy to me.  I think Dick Tracy  was a lot skinnier than that.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  He walked away,  and he ran away.  He was so upset.  David,  we might have created  a monster because  he had so much fun  once he started  making fun of people  that even when we were done,  he just started walking  by people going,  what are you supposed to be?  Not on tape.  He walks by this  Dick Tracy guy again  who was obviously furious,  who had his back to David  while the kid was on the phone,  and David pats him  on the back  and just says, 
[00:44:00]  thanks for the interview,  Dick.  Oh, God.  He's going to be  on 42nd Street.  Hey, who are all you  black guys in red hats  and red scarves?  Oh, right on.  Did they think  you were dressed  as Joby Joby Doo?  You know,  the funny thing  about the Scooby Doo guy  was that he was passing  around these cards  for his website.  He has some website  called www.nerdyblackguy.com  or something,  and he was supposed to  to pay, yeah.  All right, listen,  we've got to take a break. 
[00:44:30]  Part two with intern David.  Now, you left Comic Con,  but he stayed there?  Yeah, that's the thing.  I had to go,  I had to get a train home,  so I left,  but E-Rock was there,  and so he met us there,  and he was like,  well, I'm going to  stick around for a while.  David, if you don't  want to go home,  we'll just walk around  together.  And then David filled me  in on what I missed.  It's a good story.  Yes, it is.  Look at David.  Yes, it is.  Yeah, we'll get into  that after the break.  Intern David, 
[00:45:00]  you stay on the couch there.  I'll be an answer.  Oh, okay.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Opie and Anthony.  Part two of intern David.  Executive.  The executive intern.  Yes.  At Comic Con with Sam.  Yes.  So Sam left to catch a train,  and David stayed behind,  and E-Rock showed up, right?  Yeah, well, David.  Well, E-Rock was already there, 
[00:45:30]  yeah.  E-Rock met me and Sam  and Sam's girlfriend,  and then Sam and his girlfriend  had to go home.  They were busy,  so they couldn't stay anymore,  and me and E-Rock stayed  and observed all the different toys  and what was going on there.  And I hear you have  a good E-Rock story,  and we love a good E-Rock story  on this show.  Who doesn't?  Oh, I know you do.  Yeah, what do you got on E-Rock?  Well, we walked around,  we saw all the toys and stuff,  and then we proceeded  to move on to another area  where there were  people signing autographs.  Ah, these are where  the big celebrities are.  The big gets.  Yeah.  You see any big celebrities 
[00:46:00]  there, Intern David?  Well, we saw some big celebrities.  Yeah.  I mean, but to me,  they weren't that big,  but to E-Rock,  to E-Rock,  they were really, really huge.  Yeah, E-Rock is a nerd.  He's the biggest nerd among us.  That's for sure.  Yep.  All right, continue, David.  Biggest anything among us.  Okay, well,  two individuals were there.  William Catt and Robert Culp  were there  from The Greatest American Hero. 
[00:46:30]  Hey, wait, wait.  Robert Culp was also there?  Yes, Robert Culp was there, yes.  Wow.  Wow.  Is that a wow moment?  That, to get both of them together,  is like pretty much  reuniting the Beatles.  I'm amazed that  I wasn't told this before.  Ugh.  Who cares?  If they were on fire,  I wouldn't go by their booth.  Like reuniting two Dung Beatles.  Well, we keep playing this song,  Greatest American Hero, David. 
[00:47:00]  Yes.  Because of what you saw  at Comic-Con this past weekend.  Yes.  What did you see?  We saw William Catt  and Robert Culp  from The Greatest American Hero.  Okay.  Now,  E-Rock saw them  and got super,  super excited  because he claims  that William Catt  was his childhood hero  and that this was his favorite  show of all time  and he used to watch  this show every single day  and he loved this show  so much  and he was so excited.  Now,  how did you know  he was really excited?  What did he do? 
[00:47:30]  He said,  Oh, look at William Catt.  Oh, look at William Catt.  Oh, my God.  This is my favorite guy  from all of all time.  I love this guy.  E-Rock.  And then I proceeded to say,  I have no idea  who this guy is  because I didn't know  who the heck  William Catt was.  I had no clue.  You never saw the show, huh?  No,  because I found out later  that when this show aired,  I was one and two years old  when the show aired  so I had no idea about it.  Not even E-Rock's old  at this point.  Yes.  I had no idea about it, yeah.  But E-Rock, 
[00:48:00]  very excited, huh?  Very excited.  He probably saw  the Greatest American Hero sign  and thought it was  a big sandwich.  He thought it said zero  and it was his name.  He had to take a seat.  So before we were walking up,  there was a little bit of a line,  so other people  were getting his autograph.  So E-Rock proceeded  to tell me a story  about how he has a little mark  underneath his eye,  a gash.  We've all seen  the little scar gash  thing under E-Rock's eye.  Yes, I didn't know about it.  A little scar or something.  Yeah, I don't know  if everyone knows.  I'll explain it real quick. 
[00:48:30]  According to E-Rock,  he was one day  watching the Greatest  American Hero  at his home  and proceeded to pretend  to be the Greatest  American Hero  and proceeded to fly  down the room  in his house.  So he flew down his house  and went into  his parents' bedroom  and flew right  into his parents'  nightstand  and hit right  into the light  below his eye  and got a huge gash.  Well, he was fake flying.  He was fake flying, yeah.  He was fake flying.  He was moving his hands  out and running  and pretending to fly, yes.  He flew into his mother's  bedroom right  into the nightstand  and got a big gash  underneath his eye. 
[00:49:00]  All because he loves  the show.  He loves the show  and wanted to pretend  that he was  the Greatest American Hero  and pretend he was  William Catt.  Yes.  What was this show  even about?  He's the Greatest  American Hero, Jimmy.  Come on.  He had some type  of superpowers  but he's just  a regular guy  so he didn't really  know how to use  him very well.  He couldn't fly  like E-Rock.  He couldn't fly  very well  and he'd crash  into things.  That's why I guess  they show him  flying all silly there.  Obviously, he's just  standing on one leg 
[00:49:30]  in that picture.  He was driving  and these aliens  came down  and gave him  a special  superpowers suit.  Oh, that's how  it happened?  Ah, a superpowers suit?  Yeah, the whole...  The suit is what  gives him the power?  Yeah, he doesn't have it  unless he's wearing  the suit.  I did not know that.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Hey, intern Dave,  why don't you interview  E-Rock about his obsession  with the...  Well, there's more  about that gash.  Okay.  Well, what else?  Well, so when he  finally got to him  and E-Rock introduces  himself, he tells him  he's a big fan,  he loves the show,  he proceeded to tell 
[00:50:00]  William Catt.  Oh, he pointed out  with his finger  the gash on his eye.  Oh, William,  this is the gash  that I got.  He proceeded to tell  the whole story  about the gash  underneath his eye.  No, he didn't.  He did.  He did.  He told him  about the gash.  How bored was  William Catt  as he was listening  to E-Rock?  He couldn't care less  about the gash  on the E-Rock side.  He couldn't care less.  He probably heard  that a million times.  Oh, I'm your biggest fan.  I'm your biggest fan.  This happened to me.  Now E-Rock is so excited  and telling him  about the gash.  Was E-Rock bummed out  that the guy  could care less?  No, he was really...  E-Rock was super excited.  He was like in a mood. 
[00:50:30]  He was so excited  that he shook his hand,  got a picture,  got an autograph.  He was like going crazy.  Were you slightly  embarrassed for E-Rock?  I was a little bit embarrassed.  Why?  Because E-Rock was kind of like  a little bit...  I think he was overdoing  himself a little bit too much.  Like gushing  and having like a man crush on him?  I think so.  Yeah?  Basically making  a big fat fool of himself.  Meanwhile,  I was standing there  having no clue  who the heck this guy was.  I had no clue, yes.  When Robert Culp was there,  he comes over  and he's shaking hands  and he says hi to David.  He goes, 
[00:51:00]  I have no idea who you are.  I don't know anything  you've done.  Oh, my God.  Now, Robert Culp  does have an acting career.  He's got a nice little resume.  He was in...  You know him if you saw him.  I Spy.  I Spy with Bill Cosby.  He was in I Spy,  the original one.  He was in Turk 182.  He was in a lot of episodes  of Columbo.  He was played a good boy  for Columbo.  That guy, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Robert Culp.  He's been in a million things.  He was in  Greatest American Hero?  Mm-hmm.  What did he do?  He was...  His name was Bill Maxwell.  I believe he was a detective 
[00:51:30]  that was assigned to protect the...  Yeah, I don't remember him  from Greatest American Hero.  How many years was it on?  Like two years, I think.  44 episodes.  That's it?  That's it.  81 to 83.  Yeah.  And that goddamn song  became a hit on the radio.  This was played all the time.  And now from  The Greatest American Hero,  believe it or not,  here on PLJ.  Right.  Who sang it?  Um... 
[00:52:00]  Good question.  And is this a...  What's his name  that does all the TV songs?  Alan Thicke?  Was this an Alan Thicke song?  No.  This was a biggie  back in the day.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Believe it or not,  I'm walking on air.  Well, actually, intern David,  you told me that  E-Rock knows the song?  Well, he was trying to  get me to figure out  and try to remember the show.  And he's like,  don't you remember 
[00:52:30]  the famous song?  I'm like, what song?  And E-Rock starts singing  the first verse,  believe it or not,  I'm walking on air.  And I'm like,  oh, I know that song,  but I don't know the show.  Yeah, all right.  Did you really sing  the opening lyrics?  That's most of the song  that I knew  was that very beginning.  Are you mortified  that intern David  is calling you out  on your obsession  with The Greatest American Hero?  No, because he didn't understand  why I was dragging him  through people  so he could take  the photo for me.  He's like,  where are we going?  Where are we going?  I said,  I just told you  where we're going.  And he gets over there  and he's all uncomfortable  telling everybody  he doesn't know  what they do for a living. 
[00:53:00]  It was uncomfortable  for me because  I had no clue who I am.  I'm like,  I'm taking a picture  of this guy.  Who the hell is this guy?  I'm waiting for William Catt  and I turn around,  I can't find David  and he's saying hi  to some guy  who's wearing  a Ghostbuster outfit.  Oh, God.  David's such a collection  of douches.  I know.  David's just a simpleton.  Was Big Kev there?  Oh, yeah.  I love Comic-Con, man.  I'd have to go.  It's actually fun.  You're going to smash  these people  and it's like,  you see these dumb celebrities  and you're like,  oh, my God,  when they have the Warriors  show up. 
[00:53:30]  I like that guy.  It was really  some cool kind of  D-level guys.  Were you excited  for anyone over there  in turn, David?  Did you see anyone  where you went,  oh, wow.  Well, the wrestling people  were pretty famous  like the Honky Tonk Man  was there  and Sam got to meet him  and get his picture  and autograph.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  So Sam got excited.  The Honky Tonk Man  was there  in his full wrestling outfit  like the Elvis costume.  What else is he going to do?  The Honky Tonk Man.  How did his song go?  I'm the Honky Tonk Man. 
[00:54:00]  Cool, cocky, and bad.  Right, right.  Is he still wrestling  in the Tenet League somewhere?  Yeah, he does wrestling  with alcohol.  And then there were  other wrestlers  like Scott Steiner  was there, too.  Yeah.  Yep, Scott Steiner  and the guy  from the Bushwhackers  was there, too.  Wow.  Which one?  I think Luke.  Well, they used to come out  doing that walk.  Yeah, he was there, yeah.  I didn't want to get a picture  with one Bushwhacker.  No, you need both Bushwhackers.  That's not as valuable  as both, right?  Right.  The Bushwhacker  is not the Bushwhacker.  Exactly.  Erick, comment on what 
[00:54:30]  intern David's saying?  No, it's all true.  I went for the Honky Tonk Man  at least, yeah.  Did the Honky Tonk Man  have a little work done?  Yeah, he's got some...  He's very shiny  under the eyes.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like the Honky Tonk  right there.  Up in the Widow's Peaks  looks like some kind  of hair restoration  or something there.  Oh!  Probably plugs,  if you could tell.  Not hair restoration  where there's individual follicles  from the harvest area.  Harvested.  Hey, intern David,  anything else from Comic-Con? 
[00:55:00]  Did we cover it all?  Yeah, pretty much.  There are famous celebrities.  We saw, I don't know  if you know,  but Melody Anderson  was there who played  the female on  the Flash Gordon movie.  She was there.  Wow.  David's got a photographic memory  because he didn't know  any of these people  and then I'm like,  that's the Honky Tonk Man  and he said,  oh, the Honky Tonk Man  and now he remembers  every single name.  Who else?  There was one point  where we're walking  and Sam and his girlfriend  are a little bit ahead of us  and we're trying to figure out  other people to interview 
[00:55:30]  and David goes,  there's no line for Lou Ferrigno.  Why don't we go over there?  And his handler  is right near  where David is standing  trying to draw people  to the line  and he keeps going,  why are we talking  to Lou Ferrigno?  There's nobody talking  to Lou Ferrigno.  Oh, that's got to suck  to these guys.  That's got to be  the worst part  is what do you do  to make it look like  things are going as planned?  Yeah, yeah.  He didn't want a line.  People had lines  and Lou Ferrigno was empty  so I was like,  why don't we talk to him  and try to get an interview?  This is everyone's reality  by the way.  Fast forward 10 years,  there's an old  Anthony and I  sitting there  hoping that someone 
[00:56:00]  comes up to our table.  Remember St. Patrick's Cathedral?  We're the guys.  Ed Mayer.  Yeah, you get pictures of us.  Just signing pictures  from us at AAF.  Here's the only thing  I'm trying to get  to the bottom.  That's our future.  You know it, right?  Oh, no.  Please.  What do you got to say?  The only thing  I'm trying to get  to the bottom of  is what actually  happened at Comic-Con  because before David  came in here,  Eric started yelling  at him and calling him  a liar. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Most of what David  said is true.  I did not say  nor tell William Katt  that he was  my childhood hero.  What?  I believe David.  Was he on the hero list?  No, he was never  on the hero list.  He told me,  when we were first  going up to William Katt  and Eric was trying  to tell me who he was  because I had no clue.  He told me he was  his childhood hero.  I never said  childhood hero.  He said it.  I told you all  about the show.  And he said  I was my childhood hero.  I even got a gash  under my eye  all because of my hero.  Yes, Eric did.  Yes. 
[00:57:00]  Here's also something  that David left out.  I did tell you  that I used to have,  I was three, four  when the show was on.  I used to have  the costume,  so I used to wear  the costume a lot  for The Greatest American Hero  with the cape  and everything.  It was an all red  and black outfit.  And you said costume wrong,  Sam.  It's costume.  It's not costume.  Costume.  Costume.  No S-H in it.  Costume.  Costume.  Costume.  Watching Sam  a novel is  costume.  It's a costume.  Costume.  He moves his lips 
[00:57:30]  forward.  Costume.  Costume.  Say it at home.  It's kind of fun.  After a while.  Costume.  Costume.  Yeah.  Costume.  And people are pointing out  if Intern David says  proceed one more time,  they want us to hit him  with a cattle prod  or something.  So he was really...  Proceeded.  Yeah.  He was really...  Evox lying right now  about not being the hero.  Yes.  If you had a little suit,  a little Greatest American Hero  costume that you put on, 
[00:58:00]  you absolutely...  He was your hero.  Why would you ever wear that?  Because you're three, four.  When you see something  on television,  you want to dress up like it.  No, you don't.  What, 100 pounds?  I think you're lying.  I think you got that scar  when you were 17.  Making the whoosh noise  as you ran through  your parents' house.  Whoosh.  Whoosh.  Just imagine  a chubby little E-rock  in a costume.  Did they have to get  the extra large one? 
[00:58:30]  Of course they did.  The tear on the little honey.  Are you with me?  I just want to say costume.  For the next hour now.  Costume.  Oh, man.  God, what a crew  you guys were this weekend, huh?  So he was really gushing.  He was gushing.  He was pretty, like,  flipping out  and really excited, yes.  Is he downplaying it now,  you think?  He's downplaying it, yes.  No.  Now, E-rock got very excited  about the Greatest American Hero guy.  Who would make you  very excited, intern David?  If they walked in that door right now,  who would be the big,  oh, my God,  I can't believe 
[00:59:00]  he's in the studio with me?  Who's your big get?  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  You know who David really likes?  The Indian chick from ER.  Indian chick from ER?  She was also in Bend It Like Beckham.  Oh, her.  Yeah, I like her, yeah.  He's talking about her all the time.  How do you like her?  I don't know.  She's hot.  I like her.  I don't know.  Is she American Indian  or Indian from India?  No, Indian from India.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You like Indian chicks?  Yeah.  Look at her.  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah?  Dark, nice, long hair.  Yeah.  Look at her.  I can't even look at you, yeah.  Do you see Slumdog Millionaire?  No, I haven't seen it yet.  Oh, you'll fall in love  with the girls in that.  Oh, boy.  Why don't we show them the picture?  She's pretty hot.  The star of Slumdog Millionaire.  You tell me what you think of her.  The adult version of Lannica.  Mm.  Yes.  This girl.  Tell me if you like her.  She's very pretty.  Intern David.  Where's the good picture?  She's a big star in India, I think, right?  Mm-hmm.  Is she?  Yeah.  I hope so.  She probably would be.  Oh, Danny, I saw what you did.  Danny just doesn't know the Indian. 
[01:00:00]  That's hilarious.  What?  He's trying to figure out  which one is the chicken.  He's...  That is really funny.  You're gay.  I'm going through their names  on the IMDb.  So he guessed that this one  would be the Indian chicken  and it was a dude.  How can you tell  with the Indian names?  Well, because, you know what?  I'm looking at their names  and I'm like,  all right, that's not going to work.  So then I start looking  at their character names  and that's not working.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can't figure out  which one was the broads.  I'll tell you if it says Lannica.  Uh, Lat...  Right there, Lannica?  Lannica, I'm sorry.  Yeah, Lannica, right there. 
[01:00:30]  This chick.  What do you think, Intern David,  before we take a break?  Well, I can't...  I'll make it bigger.  Whoa, whoa, wee, whoa.  Whoa.  This girl.  Show him that picture right there.  Where am I looking?  Yeah, you like that?  Yeah, let me see.  Can't see.  Get up and look at her.  I know, exactly.  You want everybody  to move out of your way?  Come here, David.  Jesus.  What a bum.  That's the star  slumdog millionaire.  Get up there.  She's a very pretty girl. 
[01:01:00]  He's scared to get  too close to the screen.  She's very nice.  I like her, yeah.  All right.  Come on.  Use the fist.  What happened to the fist?  What happened to one fist?  Okay.  Yeah, I like her.  She's very nice.  You did it again.  What's wrong with you?  David, you taught us  all one fist away, remember?  He did the one fist  and then he moved  way in closer.  Way in close.  There's a nice picture  of her face.  What do you think?  She's very hot.  I like her.  All right.  She's a pretty girl.  Yeah.  Iraq can't even get facts  about Grace Merck 
[01:01:30]  and a hero, right?  Let's say hi to Tim.  Has a problem with Iraq.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Tim.  Look, Iraq doesn't know  anything about this show.  Bill Maxwell was an FBI agent,  not a private detective.  I didn't say private detective.  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did, Iraq.  You said detective.  And the alien.  He's a private detective.  He did, right, David?  He's a private detective.  We've all heard of him.  He didn't know  what he's talking about, either.  No.  And so David has a weird,  like, memory, so. 
[01:02:00]  Go ahead, Housewives of the...  And what happened is  that the aliens made Bill  Ralph's partner,  because Bill being an FBI agent,  would have an inside track  to all the cases  they would need Ralph  to be intervening on.  Ah.  That's all.  They had a private detective  running around.  And the reason why  Ralph was such a bad hero  is because he lost  the instruction booklet  three times during the show.  all the instructions  for the suit?  Yeah.  Right.  So he didn't know  how to use it.  Why'd they pick him  to give the suit to? 
[01:02:30]  Really, because he had  a good heart.  Ew.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was the 80s.  Yeah.  Was it?  All right.  What a terrible time  to have a show.  81 to 83.  I must have been doing  blow with my mom  when this was on.  Yeah, exactly.  No, wait, guys.  It gets better.  All right.  When the show was doing  really low in the ratings,  they tried to bring it back  when Ralph gave the suit  to a girl  and made it the greatest  American heroine  for one episode.  Yeah.  Why was it only  lasted one episode? 
[01:03:00]  Well, yeah,  it was a girl.  Yeah.  I guess they tried  to make it,  but they probably tried  a little spin-off thing.  It didn't work out.  They tried to recycle  Robert Culp into the role  and, you know,  as the liaison,  but the girl was all,  you know,  save the whales,  help, you know,  special needs kids,  you know,  that kind of girl.  Bleeding,  hard, liberal crap.  Well, the problem is  I'm looking at the girl.  She's ugly.  Yeah.  If you're going to have her  as the greatest American hero,  you've got to get some...  And why would you cover 
[01:03:30]  up her entire body  with a...  Wouldn't you rework  the suit  and show some skin, man?  She looks like  Lotka's wife.  Harold Kane.  I looked at Wayne Cat.  It's not like  they were looking  for looks  at any of these people.  Well, what about...  Let me ask you.  What else has this guy done?  What's his name?  William Cat?  Dude, that was it.  He was in Carrie.  He was pretty much  one and done.  Oh, he was in Carrie.  He was the one  that brought Carrie  to the prom.  Oh, okay.  Very good.  I forgot about that.  Very nice.  All right, Tim.  Other than that,  nothing.  All right, Tim. 
[01:04:00]  Thank you so much.  What happened in 83?  What, did he get accused  of child trafficking  that's never worked again?  Believe it or not,  George isn't at home.  Please leave a message  at the beat.  I must be out  or I pick up the phone.  Where could I be?  Believe it or not,  I'm not home.  What is that?  From Seinfeld.  That's George's  outgoing message.  Seinfeld. 
[01:04:30]  He sang it  with the music.  You're talking about  Grey's American Hero.  You've got to play that.  That was such a funny episode.  Absolutely.  The way he was just kind of  pantomiming the words  himself.  He was just having fun with it.  It's like,  where could I be?  And he throws his shoulders  off.  Like, I don't know.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  You've got Sam.  You've got executive intern David.  E-Rock,  could you just do me  a personal favor?  Yeah.  When you leave the studio,  could you leave it  like you flew around the house  when you...  You've got a cash on your own. 
[01:05:00]  Do it towards the window.  Or bump into something.  Yeah, I just kind of  really want to see  all the way out the door  if you could just do that.  This is what E-Rock  used to do as a kid.  I know it's radio.  I know it's radio, but...  Imagine going.  There he goes.  There he goes.  E-Rock fake flying  out of the studio.  What a jackass.  I know.  I recognize him.  He's above the Super Bowl  this year.  Oh, no.  All right.  When we get back,  we'll get into the A-Rod thing,  I guess, a little bit. 
[01:05:30]  A little bit.  And some other things.  More Grammy talk  and Sully.  I think we've got  the Sully interview  coming in.  Yeah.  Some sound clips  from the Sully interview  that was done last night.  Oh, that E-Rock.  But first,  it's Black History Month.  Who are we looking at today?  Oh.  To celebrate Black History Month,  the Opie and Anthony Show  is recognizing  those historic  African-Americans  without whom  this country  would not be  the melting pot  it is today.  Today,  we honor  Tiny Zeus Lister,  whose riveting performance 
[01:06:00]  as the brutalizing  Zeus  in No Holds Barred  kicked off  a whirlwind career,  leading to dozens  of roles  in films  that called  for an enormous  black man  with a weird  blinky eye,  such as Debo  in Friday  and President Lindbergh  in The Fifth Element.  What was his name?  A black president.  Right.  Stay tuned  for more icons  of black history  on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:06:30]  Still lots to do.  Opie and Anthony,  Kim Norton,  A-Rod,  What do you guys  think of the A-Rod thing?  I think it's a bunch  of bunk.  Well, he tested positive  for steroids  back in 2003,  I guess.  No, apparently  he's one of the  bunch of people  that were kind of,  they kind of did  a survey  of some sort. 
[01:07:00]  What's a little shady?  Yeah, to see,  like,  who was doing steroids.  Mm-hmm.  And he's one of  quite a few  ballplayers.  And Curt Schilling,  that do-gooder.  Yeah.  That said,  you know,  that they had done steroids.  But I don't think  it was one of those things  where you're fessing up to it  and it's supposed to get out  and all that stuff.  No.  But it did.  And there's a bunch  of other ballplayers  that they're not releasing  their names.  And Curt Schilling,  who claims never to do,  he's never done steroids,  he's like,  I demand the list, 
[01:07:30]  I want all the names.  Yeah.  Who else was on the steroids?  Look,  it was the era  of the steroids  in baseball.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Nothing.  I hate Barry Bonds  as a person,  but what are you going  to do in the end?  Are you going to take  all his home runs away?  Why such a big deal?  So many of these guys  were on steroids.  It's pretty obvious now.  Jose Canseco's running around  going,  see,  I told you,  and he's ready to write  another book with more names.  Yeah.  The Rocket? 
[01:08:00]  Roger Clemens.  I'm not a fan of A-Rod  whatsoever,  but I mean,  he's one of many guys  that were doing steroids  at that time.  They're calling him  a-hole on the cover  of one of the papers.  So what are you going to do?  Nothing.  Enough of them.  Goddamn steroid problem.  Who cares?  Right.  They put something in place.  You're testing people now.  Who cares what they did  years ago? 
[01:08:30]  Enough.  I'm a big fan of the steroids.  Love it.  Not for myself,  but my athletes,  I want them on steroids.  Monsters.  I want monsters.  I want monsters  that the second they retire,  they get giant brain tumors.  Bunch of big dopes.  See,  we walk around  with the regular Joes,  but when it comes  to my entertainment,  I want to look at monsters  that are hitting  500,  600-foot home runs  and pitching  150-mile-an-hour  fastballs  and checking people  into the boards  where the whole boards  just self-destruct 
[01:09:00]  and shatter  onto the fans.  That's the type of thing  I want.  I want to see more  Darryl Dawkins-type  basketball players  just completely destroying  the backboard.  Chocolate Thunder.  Remember Chocolate Thunder?  Chocolate Thunder.  He would name his dunks  and they had to like...  That's one of my dunks  I had after a Guinness  night.  Chocolate Thunder.  They had to come up  with new backboards  because of this guy.  He shattered,  I don't know,  more than one.  Yeah.  Look that up on YouTube 
[01:09:30]  if you've never heard  of Darryl Dawkins  and his...  Darryl Dawkins.  Sorry,  Darryl Dawkins.  And his Duncan.  Right.  Darryl Dawkins.  Yeah,  Darryl Dawkins on YouTube.  His stuff is amazing.  Who cares?  I don't care.  I don't think  they're role models.  I think as a parent  you've got to go,  hey, Johnny.  They're on steroids.  What can I tell you?  Look at that.  Look at the shattering  on the backboard.  The good old...  What did they change  that...  Stop that,  by the way.  What did they actually change?  The back.  The back? 
[01:10:00]  They had to like...  Did they get a different  type of glass  or just put the...  They put the little hinge  on there too  so the rim actually  gives a little more.  Oh, okay.  No, it gives a lot.  I mean,  that ain't happening.  If you're slamming  and hanging on to the ring  it's going to...  Rim, excuse me,  it's going to collapse  a little bit.  Yeah.  So, just amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  There was so many  of those pictures  where you just see  the guys dunking backwards  hanging on the rim  with their mouths open  and I would look at that  in the paper  and just go,  oh my God, okay. 
[01:10:30]  I'm sorry.  It just looked  a little bizarre  to me is all.  There was one last week  and I actually thought of that.  Oh, was there?  Oh, yeah.  Damn it.  They are so bad.  Danny's got something?  A friend of mine  used to take  the really good ones  and he would cut them  out of the sports pages  of all the papers  and he had like  a compilation of them  on his wall  on his judgment.  What?  That's all?  He just had a compilation.  What?  Oh, you're wrong. 
[01:11:00]  What's going on?  Such a shame  because this is  wonderful racist.  What?  There wasn't one racist thing  I said  that when they hang  on the rim like that  and because a lot of times  their knees are bent  their legs are bent  and they're way up  and they're backwards on it  and their mouths are open  and they're just kind of  hanging on the rim.  It's amazing  that you can actually do that.  You're just admiring  their athletic ability.  Right.  Is this the phone call  coming in saying  shut up  or you'll be fired  if you go any further? 
[01:11:30]  How many did he break  I wonder?  I don't know.  There was more than one  that's for sure.  Huh?  Oh, the dentist.  We played the audio last week  and your mom  absolutely loved this damn thing.  Oh, yeah.  We can play this again  before we get to the Sully audio.  My mother is not  computer savvy whatsoever.  So I was like,  hey, mom,  I got to show you something.  She was over the house  last night.  I go, yeah,  check out this on YouTube.  What's YouTube?  And I got to explain.  And she goes,  what, people send you these?  Is it for the show? 
[01:12:00]  I was like, no, no.  This is global, worldwide.  People can post videos  from everywhere in the world  and you can get to watch them.  And she couldn't really  fathom why you would want that.  And grasp it.  And I'm just like,  oh, God, parents.  She doesn't have a computer?  No, she'll never have a computer.  I showed her the iPhone  and some of the stuff it does  and she was amazed by it.  She was like,  oh, like video is on it.  Oh, the shave man.  It was.  What?  Not the iPhone.  There was no video. 
[01:12:30]  Well, no,  I was playing YouTube videos.  Oh, okay.  So there was indeed video.  I wasn't taking video.  You know,  your mom's not your mom.  She's more like an older sister.  Really?  Yeah.  Coke buddy.  Yeah, Coke buddy.  Coke buddy.  If you weren't listening earlier,  yeah,  what are you doing?  You missed some good stuff.  The little blow  with mom and Sal  back in the 80s.  What are you going to do?  That's normal.  It was back in a day  where everybody was doing it.  So she loved the dentist,  the kid in the backseat?  Yeah,  little David goes to the dentist. 
[01:13:00]  Is that what it was?  All doped up.  Yeah.  What's that video up to,  Danny?  When we checked on Friday,  it had something like  four million views.  Yeah, it was close.  It's got to be way over far now.  Yeah, let's see what it looks like.  That's huge.  But here's the clip  that really got us going,  really making us laugh.  And your mom was just dying  when she saw the video.  How did it go?  I didn't feel anything.  Yeah.  Uh, I feel funny.  Kind of felt good, didn't it?  Uh, is this real life? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, this is real life.  Okay, now I have two fingers.  Good.  I have four fingers.  You feel good?  You feel good?  I can't see anything.  Yes, you can.  Stay in your seat.  Oh, yeah!  I don't feel tired. 
[01:14:00]  You don't?  Uh, draw stitches.  Uh-huh.  Why can't I touch it?  Because it'll...  Uh, you know what?  Oh, boy.  Stump Brain, seriously.  It's not even funny anymore.  Oh, no.  Do you like...  It's not even...  It's ridiculous.  Think like Sully.  Oh.  Think like Sully.  Oh.  Just bring it in.  But every day,  the listeners are getting sick of this.  No, I mean,  think like Sully. 
[01:14:30]  Put it in the Hudson.  Oh, I would love it.  I would love it.  Exactly.  Throw it in the goose.  Throw it in the...  Look, I know the company's broke  and the business is falling apart,  but they can at least do the basics for us.  While that track was playing,  it wasn't even like...  It wasn't even counting down.  It was just...  Really?  It was just standing there at a...  You feel good?  We'll try it from here.  I can't see anything.  Yes, you can.  Stay in your seat.  Oh, yeah! 
[01:15:00]  I don't feel tired.  You don't?  Um...  Draw stitches.  Uh-huh.  Why can't I touch it?  Because it'll mess up the stitches.  You have four eyes.  Yeah.  I feel funny.  Why is this happening to me?  It's okay, bud.  It's just from the medicine. 
[01:15:30]  Okay?  Is this going to be forever?  No.  No, it won't be forever.  Ugh.  He's all disgusted.  That's not going to be forever.  He's like, ugh.  We're with you, kid.  And his head is just like...  Bobble...  It's like a bobble head.  He can't keep it up.  Right.  He's a very cute little boy shirt on.  He's just a cute kid.  It's so funny that he's such a cute little kid and he's so effed up.  Now, how is that kid going to say no to drugs when he gets older, when he has this fine experience at seven or eight years old? 
[01:16:00]  When he stands up, the intensity in his face when he stands up and screams is hysterical.  Well, Danny found the original David F. after the dentist clip on YouTube.  Uh-huh.  6.4 million views.  But I saw what you were going through to find the original clip.  And there's other ones that are the exact same video, obviously, that people posted that are pushing a million.  Yeah, people love to just rip and then repost.  Five, six hundred thousand per... 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, this clip, probably in total, I mean, you've got to be looking at over eight million.  Eight million?  Yeah.  Just like that.  He's an internet sensation.  Oh, boy, is he.  He's the next chocolate rain.  Yeah.  Okay, rare.  That's it.  Remember the Britney guy who was going to get a deal?  Leave Britney alone.  Some stupid, fruity network was going to give him his own show.  Yeah.  I hate show business.  Yeah, where did he go?  He's still trying to do it.  Is he really?  Yeah, he's still up there. 
[01:17:00]  No one cares about him.  But it's just not working.  People don't seem to understand, like, these internet videos, when they hit, like, you have about a week to capitalize, and then it's all over.  Yeah, because you can't have a follow-up.  What are you going to do?  Give the kid heroin and go, all right, now here's my kid on heroin.  Just lock him to a radiator.  Even the Christian Bale stuff, like, that was great for, like, last week.  Sure.  Now it's like, all right, Christian Bale.  That's the world we live in now.  You can be famous, you know, Monday and Tuesday.  Wednesday, you're nobody again.  Yeah, you're famous for two days. 
[01:17:30]  That whole 15 minutes of fame thing.  It's less now.  15 minutes is a minute.  15 minutes is a minute, right?  Now you get one minute.  Yeah.  That's so funny.  You can be, like, the most popular celebrity for two days.  Two.  And then third day, dah, you're a has-been, dude.  Then we're on to something else.  Look at Sully.  We're sick of Sully.  Enough Sully.  They're giving him the key to the city today.  Most of us love Sully, but at this point, we're sick of him.  We all want to put on horseshoes and kick Sully's teeth and gums in. 
[01:18:00]  We're done with you, Sully.  You know the father's walking around like, oh, my God, how do we capitalize on this?  Yeah, that's me.  Remember that kid?  Yeah, we got it.  Maybe we get him on crystal meth or something.  Yeah.  See what he comes up with.  Just keep giving him different drugs.  Just give him a bong and see if he figures it out on his own.  I'm stoned.  Keep shooting, please.  Say something cute, right?  You want to hear some of this Sully stuff?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:18:30]  What I don't like about Sully is he's way too calm, way too monotone, not animated whatsoever.  Maybe that's what you want in that situation.  Yeah, you don't want a pilot that talks like Chris Russo.  Yeah.  All right, here's Sully on 60 Minutes last night.  Just some of the highlights.  We won't bore you with the whole 60 minutes, that's for sure.  And about 90 seconds after takeoff, I noticed there were birds filling the entire windscreen  from top to bottom, left to right, large birds. 
[01:19:00]  Wow.  When did you realize that these birds had seriously damaged the aircraft?  When I felt, heard, and smelled the evidence of them going into the engines.  I heard the noises.  I felt the engine vibrations of the damage being done to the engines.  And I smelled what I described at the time, and I still would as a burned bird smell being  brought from the engine air into the conditioning system of the airplane. 
[01:19:30]  Delicious.  Delicious.  You think a man of Sully's intellect would have come up with a better description than  burned bird smell.  Yeah.  Bird smell.  You all know burned bird smell, don't you?  It's called like cooked turkey, something like that.  What did it smell like?  Engine burned bird.  Well said.  Wow.  The whole, what did he say?  Just full of birds.  Is it called windscreen?  Yeah.  Windscreen, I guess.  Whatever, yeah.  Just filled with birds.  Because he flew right into a giant flock of geese is what happened. 
[01:20:00]  Wow.  So you were going fast toward the Earth.  Katie, what the F?  Hey, dummy.  So you were going fast.  Hey, everything's going real fast.  Where did you think he was going?  You're in a plane.  It's in a plane.  It's always going fast unless you're at the gate.  And you're going really fast when you have to take off.  Yeah.  It's like extremely fast.  You have to leave the Earth.  I'm surprised she didn't say, so like one of the birds, you were flying.  Yeah.  So you were going fast toward the Earth. 
[01:20:30]  Yes, the water was coming up at us fast.  Do you think about the passengers at that moment?  No.  Not specifically.  I mean, more abstractly, perhaps.  I mean, I knew I had to solve this problem.  I knew I had to find a way out of this box I found myself in.  Did you at any point pray?  I would imagine somebody in back was taking care of that for me while I was flying the airplane.  About 155 people?  I think my focus at that point was so intensely on the landing. 
[01:21:00]  You couldn't think of anything else?  I thought of nothing else.  Duh.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Do you think you had room in that brain to think of, like, you know, naked chicks and stuff?  You're not going to bring anything else up in your head when you have those moments.  It's just instinct kicks in.  Self-preservation.  You're doing whatever you have to do to save your ass.  It's still just ridiculous when you think about it.  The physiological reaction I had to this was strong. 
[01:21:30]  And I had to force myself to use my training and force calm on the situation.  Was that a hard thing to do?  No.  It just took some concentration.  Did it feel like three and a half minutes?  Yes, it did.  Really?  Really.  I like the fact when she said, really, dumb Katie Cork wanted him to elaborate.  And he was like, yes, really.  Yes, it did.  She wanted, like, well, it felt like hours we were up there, but three and a half minutes? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  That's what it felt like, dummy.  No, it felt like 324.  Does that matter?  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  When you landed, you and the first officer looked at each other.  And we said, well, that wasn't as bad as I thought.  And then we quickly began doing our duties.  He was running the evacuation checklist while I opened the door and commanded evacuate.  Did you give yourself even a few seconds, though, to acknowledge that you had averted disaster? 
[01:22:30]  No, because I hadn't quite yet.  And I had business to attend to.  I had a job to do.  Yeah, that was half the...  Yeah.  A lot of those people could have died if they fell into that water.  Yeah, or if the plane sunk real fast with people still in it.  Hypothermia takes you out in, like, less than 10 minutes if you're in that water.  In that water?  Way less.  Within three minutes, you're pretty much...  Three minutes.  ...epacitated.  Your muscles just say, F you. 
[01:23:00]  Right.  Not working anymore.  So, there you go.  Just some of the highlights from the beginning of last night.  Good old Sully.  Give him the key to the city.  How about that?  He'll be on Letterman.  He's going to be on the air today, so...  So, how was it?  Well, I took the plane and landed in the Hudson River.  So, once you landed, did you have a celebratory martini before opening the door?  Yeah.  Did you call friends and family, or did you update your Facebook status? 
[01:23:30]  Yes.  That's stupid questions.  You were going fast.  People are pointing out that Katie Couric is worse than Larry King.  Not sure.  Ah, well.  You know.  How important is...  Are the wings.  Right.  When you're flying.  What type of bird was it?  A goose?  Or a gander?  You're old Larry.  Do you think one might have been one that could lay a golden egg? 
[01:24:00]  And it was actually a golden egg that did the damage.  Sully, comment.  Were any of them silly?  I heard they can be silly.  In flocks.  Did you say to your co-pilot, let's get the flock out of here?  Just a funny joke Sandy Koufax told me once when I never met him.  What a douche.  I do. 
[01:24:30]  At first, did you think it was a bottle of Grey Goose vodka that had been thrown through  the engine?  What a sap.  Since you were going to land in the river anyway, why didn't you try to loop the loop?  Really make it look impressive.  He hasn't been on Larry King, right?  He will be.  Oh, he'll be on tomorrow? 
[01:25:00]  Oh, get that audio.  Road tape.  They're soliciting questions.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, it's online.  Because Larry's so stupid, I'll write my own.  There's nothing else to ask him.  What happened?  We hit birds.  How'd you feel?  Nervous.  Did my job.  What else is there?  What else can you ask this guy?  Are you a pedophile?  Why does your mustache smell like cotton candy?  Now, you said you walked the aisle to see if anyone was in the plane. 
[01:25:30]  Did you steal anything?  Sully, please.  Please tell me.  I would have taken things like hair gel and garlic.  I'd have checked people's carry-on for garlic and Welch's grape juice.  All right.  There you go.  I'll look forward to that.  Yeah, the Larry King interview.  We'll learn even more.  877-212-ON-A. 
[01:26:00]  Wow, the phones are lit, but he must be tired of talking about it by now.  You think Sully's tired of talking about this?  I think he is.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't seem like the type of guy that likes the spotlight.  No, he doesn't capitalize on it.  I'm sure.  Although he is capitalizing on it.  Went to the Super Bowl.  He's here in New York.  He's doing the tour.  I think people tell him, like, yeah, this is good.  Probably, you know, U.S. Air also tells him, you know, hey, it's a good image for us, for you to be out there as the kind of representative of this airline. 
[01:26:30]  How many people are looking to see if Sully's, you know, a pilot?  Wear the uniform.  Have some pride.  You walk in, and you're like, oh, I don't have Sully.  It's all flawed every time his name is Sullenberger.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yay, we're safe.  Yeah.  They probably, like, wait until you're in the air and then go, believe it or not, you're a pilot today?  Yeah, guess who your pilot is, people.  Guess who it is, huh?  It's Sully.  I would just say it on every flight.  He busts out of the cockpit door.  Ta-da!  That's right.  He throws bird feathers at them.  Gotcha!  Did you see Branson offered him double whatever U.S. Air is paying it to fly for Virgin? 
[01:27:00]  I said no.  Well, not yet.  They're negotiating.  Ta-da!  Ta-da!  Hey, if I may suggest, try the goose today as we fly.  Ha-ha-ha!  That's not being offered.  It's a joke.  Shut up, Sully.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, I was thinking, how important is it to have both engines working on a two-engine airplane?  Sully!  How important is elevation? 
[01:27:30]  Let's go to Keith in Tampa.  Keith.  Isn't it bad to smell the engine inside the airplane?  Yeah, you can, though.  You think you can?  Yeah.  How does that work?  It's sucked up, especially at that low altitude.  Why haven't they figured that out?  Why can't they figure out some kind of...  I don't know.  It's kind of weird that stuff could just fly into those engines like that.  And they say they hit a lot of birds, obviously, but not like...  Put some screen over the front.  I don't know.  I'm not an engineer, but it just seems like they could figure that out somehow.  No? 
[01:28:00]  What do you think?  I guess it don't happen that often, so...  They don't worry about it.  They do have bird strikes a lot, but...  Some of them get sucked right in.  Most birds aren't even going to mess up the engine.  They're just going...  I don't know why.  What could you put in the front that would...  I don't know.  Probably cause a problem.  Yeah, I don't have an answer, but...  You know?  Probably get clogged.  Because if you had a screen, it would get clogged.  It would be the screen would break apart and fly through the engine.  The screen flies in there.  Now you've got this metal mesh going in there instead of some little pliable birdie.  I would imagine that they have figured this is the best it's going to be. 
[01:28:30]  There's probably multiple birds going in both engines is what happens.  And so, you know, they can sometimes take one bird.  There aren't many moving parts in a turbine engine, really.  Aside from the turbine, there's really nothing else moving.  So if that makes it through, you're all right.  What are the odds you're going to hit a bird in the sky?  Yeah.  Let me ask you, Larry King's taking questions online?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  I mean, I think that you'd only want to submit serious ones.  Oh, yeah, of course, Jimmy.  Because there is a story, and you'd have to submit this seriously. 
[01:29:00]  I love that.  But maybe to ask Sully about his famous Uncle Paul pilot story,  because his Uncle Paul was a pilot,  and would he tell the story about how his Uncle Paul inspired him?  Well, that's a good one.  Yeah.  You know, that is actually one of Sully's stories.  That would rule.  Yeah, but, I mean, you have to phrase it properly so people know that it's for real.  Are they actually calling in with their questions, or are they just, like, e-mailing him?  E-mailing.  Maybe Larry will see that and go, what's his Uncle Paul story?  Oh, that's a good idea.  Uncle Paul. 
[01:29:30]  All right, let's go to Stryker.  Stryker.  Good morning, boy.  Good morning, Stryker.  Sully, landing gear.  Overrated?  Comment.  You didn't use your landing gear.  In Sully's case, it was overrated.  Yeah.  You didn't need no landing gear.  Right on the belly.  Where can the passengers pick up their luggage?  Is there a baggage carousel at the bottom of the Hudson?  Comment. 
[01:30:00]  Your Sully material on Friday at Caroline's.  Thank you.  Kill.  Solid.  Thank you.  Solid.  Danny, where can they...  It's topical.  Where can they find that video?  Danny's been playing videos during this whole Sully break.  Bird flies into jet engine on takeoff.  Is that a good one or no?  I'm just watching it now, yeah.  Oh, no, the other one.  Yeah, the other one's pretty good.  There's like tests.  You know, like jet engine tests.  Wow.  And if you just go to YouTube, type in like, you know, bird jet engine.  Bird jet.  You'll get three or four good ones. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, definitely.  Slow motion as the bird is just getting hacked to pieces.  Oh, my God.  Slice by slice like a deli slicer.  Front rotor.  Yeah.  All right, we'll take a quick break.  We'll continue.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  I want to say hi to everyone listening to us in Norfolk, Virginia.  Some dopey writer took some shots at the radio show.  What else is new? 
[01:31:00]  Trashing the show.  Doesn't belong in Norfolk.  Because they talked about a snowstorm in New York City and why should we care?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And the PD of the station was pretty awesome.  Sticking up for us.  Nice.  We like that.  Thank you.  We're paying attention.  They talk about Central Park.  Yeah.  We made it entertaining, though, dummy.  It's about to be entertaining.  You want the weather locally? 
[01:31:30]  Pick up your iPhone and hit the weather app or whatever.  The weather button and it tells you the weather.  Right.  Stupid ass.  We talk to the world at this point.  So if we're talking about a snowstorm in New York City, trust me, we're smart enough at this point to try to make it interesting for the world.  The world.  We try anyway.  And we only pick the local stories here in New York that might matter in general.  Sorry, we can't talk about ships and carriers coming in on a constant basis and having sex with your women. 
[01:32:00]  Maybe people get sick and tired of hearing about their neighborhood anyway.  This obsession with local is really boring and embarrassing enough.  We're not a local world anymore.  We're not local anymore.  It used to be local.  You lived in your hometown and you pretty much, except for big news, didn't know anything that happened anywhere else.  That just shows, like, people that are out of touch because we're all living, yeah, like in a... 
[01:32:30]  Globally.  Pretty much.  Look at our Facebooks and our MySpaces and the rest of this stuff.  YouTube's what?  You're building your own little community that's not a little tiny local community.  You're keeping in touch with friends you haven't heard in years that live way over here and over there.  Do you only watch YouTube videos from Virginia?  Is that what you're doing?  Local?  I only watch local YouTube videos.  When I search out, I put in my local town.  Rah, rah for local.  Because it's much funnier and entertaining to watch local YouTube videos. 
[01:33:00]  Shut up.  Give it up on the local thing, especially in this year of 2009.  2009.  Yeah.  For God's sake.  Nothing is local anymore.  Nothing that you get is coming in locally anymore.  Right.  Your news isn't local.  You don't watch your local news if you want the news.  You watch your local news in the morning to goof on.  That's what we do.  To goof on the people on the news.  And the second a story breaks, no matter where it is, you go to one of the networks that cover global news. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, CNN, Fox News.  Right.  What's the matter?  You don't watch Fox News Channel because it's not local?  You don't watch O'Reilly?  You don't?  Local!  And you're a liar if you think local's cool.  Because I bet you even this writer who wrote this article about us not being local and stuff is hoping that people around the world read his stupid articles.  Oh, I bet he wishes he'd be picked up and be syndicated to a bunch of papers all over the country.  Right. 
[01:34:00]  So I want to write locally.  Instead of blogging and hoping he could get a few people to read his blogs.  Enough with you.  You're local.  I hate that.  I hate when these stupid corporate douches say that, too.  Oh, we're looking for more local content.  Cheap.  That's what you want.  You want to cheap out, is what they do.  They hire some guy for nothing.  Pennies on the dollar.  Pennies on the dollar.  And he gets in there and spins records or whatever he does.  And you get what you pay for. 
[01:34:30]  They took us out of a lot of cities to go local because I'm an obsessive a-hole.  I've been following their progress.  Oh, yeah.  Nothing has happened.  Nothing.  Nothing.  What they are, same or worse ratings in just about every single case.  Yeah.  And I told him that would happen.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Oh, we need local.  Is he a newspaper writer?  I guess.  How great is it that the news...  How does it feel that your business is going into the toilet?  Yeah. 
[01:35:00]  At least radio will be here.  Newspapers won't be.  They're going under.  And it's great.  And they should go under.  Bye-bye.  So there you go.  So good morning or good afternoon.  When are we on in North...  Good morning, I think, right?  Sort of.  Late morning or something, yeah.  Oh, we're not on live?  No, no.  Why?  I guess they've got somebody else.  Local.  They've got a local guy.  Hi, this is Bill.  I'll be at the Sunoco.  Good news.  Pink Panther 2 debuts at number four with a mere $12 million. 
[01:35:30]  Still a hit, but because of DVDs and on demand and all that.  But hopefully this will bury the whole Pink Panther series and he won't make a third.  Although I think he is going to make a third movie.  Sure he will.  Well, why wouldn't you steal something three times and wreck it?  Yeah.  But I didn't have confidence in society in general.  Society?  Society.  And I thought this movie would have a huge opening weekend.  And I'm so happy to read that it did not. 
[01:36:00]  Even Taken, who's been out...  The movie's been out two weeks now.  Liam Neeson's film, Beat It.  Yeah.  And that chick flick, He's Just Not That Into You, was number one.  Then Taken was number two.  And then a movie called Coraline, I think, or Cor...  Is it Coraline?  Coraline.  Coraline.  Coraline, Brian.  Tim Burton.  Oh, it's a...  What is that about?  Animation.  What the hell did I know about this?  It's another one of those Nightmare Before Christmas looking things.  Oh, I got to check that out.  You don't like Tim Burton's stuff?  No, I don't... 
[01:36:30]  I just don't like animations.  Yeah.  I don't hate them, but it's something like that.  Have you checked out Tim Burton's animations?  No.  Oh.  Good stuff, Jimmy.  Hi.  Yes.  Isn't it?  Well, the one where he does the Christmas and Halloween thing at the same time.  That's terrific stuff.  Check it out.  You like his stuff?  No.  You're not a big Tim Burton fan?  I'm not.  I like some Tim Burton stuff.  I thought, you know, Edward Scissorhands was pretty good.  Mm-hmm.  Well, it's not animation.  Well, no.  He doesn't do a lot of animation.  No, he doesn't do a lot of animation. 
[01:37:00]  I like Mars Attacks.  Yeah?  Yeah, that was good.  That was weird.  It was in Pahrumpf, Nevada.  It was kind of a slam on Art Bell.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Really?  I think so, yeah.  And then you got Pink Panther in fourth, and then Mall Cop nipping at the heels of Pink Panther, too.  Nipping at the heels.  Even though Mall Cop's been out there three weeks now, I think.  That killed Pink Panther.  What did Pink Panther make?  Only 12.  12, huh?  Yeah, but you know what?  It's going to be a hit, though.  Is it? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, because you got the DVD sales, then On Demand, and then the international market.  I'm telling you.  It just drops off from here, though.  I know.  What did the first one do?  I don't know.  Hmm.  Question.  And why haven't we talked about James Whitmore yet, Anthony?  Oh, my God.  You're the big fan.  I know.  I love the movie, too, but you're an uber-fan of this movie.  I got the word.  Although he did a lot more than just Shawshank.  He certainly did.  James Whitmore passed at 87.  87 years young, I like to say. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  And he died.  Of course, it was none other than Brooks, our favorite librarian from Shawshank Prison, who  yes, there it is, who got out, got paroled, and went to the halfway house and worked down  at the foodway, and just couldn't take it.  Life had went and gotten itself in a big goddamn hurry, so he went into his little room in the 
[01:38:30]  halfway house, put on his nice little suit, packed his bag for some reason.  For heaven.  And scraped.  Brooks was here on the beam before throwing a rope over, putting a noose around his neck,  and awkwardly kicking the table out with his shiny old man's shoes.  Good.  Why would they make it so easy for you to kill yourself at the halfway house, knowing that  the individuals that go to a halfway house might not be that stable, might not have their 
[01:39:00]  lives completely together, so why would you give them that option?  I wake up scared sometimes.  That was so depressing.  He didn't know where he was.  He's just some poor old sot.  Yeah.  Sometimes I'll go to feed Jake in the park, but he never comes.  Who's Jake?  Jake was his pet bird, his little pet crow or raven or whatever it was, and he set him  free when he was, he stayed with him in the prison, and then when he got paroled, he set 
[01:39:30]  him free.  And, you know, he had no friends after that.  And the bird ignored him?  Never came back?  Never came back.  No, why wouldn't?  Stupid old guy.  The best scene is him on the bus.  Even on the bus, he's scared out of his pants.  He's holding on to the seat in front of him.  His shoulders are all hunched, and his eyes are all big, and he's just scared of the bus.  He's a little stressed out.  He didn't want to leave Shawshank.  He'd been there since, oh, Arch 5, I think. 
[01:40:00]  How long had he been in jail?  Oh, forever.  Since Arch 5, I think.  Hey, Stunt Brain, Tim Burton has nothing to do with that movie.  It's coming in like crazy.  Really?  Yeah.  Was he a producer or something?  Did he have his name on it just enough to get people thinking it's a Tim Burton movie?  It fooled me, because I kind of thought so.  It has that look, because now that we've talked about it, I have seen the caricatures.  Once again, your monumental foolishness has embarrassed this radio program.  Brooks sucked as the librarian, too. 
[01:40:30]  He was the worst librarian.  He was there since 05 or something, and for years, he just piled the stupid cart full of books and magazines  and wheeled it around the prison block just saying, hey, you want a book?  Yeah, contraband.  Did he wear a costume?  Red's contraband.  Did he wear a costume?  No costume.  He wore your Shawshank uniform.  And then, you know, it took, what's his face there? 
[01:41:00]  Andy Dufresne.  Andy Dufresne.  No time at all to whip that place in shape.  Like four or five years or something, he's already got, he's getting a library, he's getting  money for a library, a GED program for some of the...  Yeah.  Put it down.  Use the Dewey Decimal System.  Brooks threw some National Geographic on a shelf.  Here's your National Geographic.  Some books over here.  Condensed books.  Condensed books.  Louis L'Amour.  He was the worst librarian and he'd been there forever. 
[01:41:30]  Lazy old douche.  He should have hung himself, this James Whitmore.  That would have been good.  At the end of his life, why not?  Why not?  Why not?  But James Whitmore was here.  Yeah.  That's sad.  He's gone.  He was in a lot of movies, though.  He wasn't, you know...  A million movies.  From the director of The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Now Stump Brain's trying to defend himself.  But who directed The Nightmare Before Christmas?  Was it?  No, I have to look.  Oh.  Oh, here comes Travis.  Travi?  What do you got?  Tim Burton produced The Nightmare Before Christmas. 
[01:42:00]  He never directed it.  Oh.  See?  Correct.  Wait, so what did Tim Burton do for Nightmare Before Christmas?  He wrote...  Passed up the money.  No, he wrote the story and he produced it.  Yeah, but is that his caricatures?  Yeah.  With all those fancy costumes?  I believe so.  But I don't think he has anything to do with Coraline, aside from, I think, maybe the studio  that he owns.  I hate when they just throw the names on some of these films.  Yeah, I agree.  You think they have something to do with the film and they really don't? 
[01:42:30]  A lot of people think that he directed Nightmare Before Christmas, so if you say  from the director of A Nightmare Before Christmas, then they think that it's Tim Burton.  Of course.  But if it was, they would put Tim Burton.  I would say Tim Burton.  Of course it would.  It's trickery.  Yes, it is.  And do we have Mickey Rourke winning Best Actor in Britain for the, what is it, the BAFTA  Awards?  The BAFTA.  That's just like the Oscars.  It's the BAFTA.  And I guess he was cursing and stuff.  What did he do?  And do we have the audio?  He was being Mickey Rourke.  Yeah, of course.  He was pulling it.  The obscenity-laced thank-you speech. 
[01:43:00]  Nice.  Very good.  Nice.  Obscenity-laced.  We'll have that on the radio for everybody.  Sorry, it's not local.  All right.  Is that guy a douche or what?  He's an absolute tool.  What a loser.  Who is he?  Well, let's get some info out.  Maybe the pest could tell him a thing or two about local radio.  About a thing or two.  Sure.  And, you know, let's just mention it.  The Pro Bowl was yesterday.  Who cares?  That is such a no-one-gives-a-crap event, the Pro Bowl. 
[01:43:30]  The problem with football, every other sport has an all-star weekend, and it's pretty popular,  makes a lot of money for the league.  Like, the NBA is having theirs, I think, this coming weekend.  Yeah.  I believe.  And hockey, they're awesome.  And the games are kind of cool to check out.  No one cares about the Pro Bowl.  You're right.  Most guys don't go because they don't want to get hurt.  Yeah.  So then you get the third-string all-stars, if that makes sense.  And it's just, it's after the big game, the big, the Super Bowl. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  That's like the end-all, be-all of the season.  Right.  And then, oh, now we'll throw you this game, too.  It's weird.  Because no one wants to get hurt.  They're in Hawaii.  No one wants to get hurt.  Football's one of these sports.  Any play, you can break your neck.  So why would they risk it for nothing?  Hack coming up after the headliner, you know?  When you're ready for this, the NFL won't accept the fact that their all-star game sucks,  and so what they're going to do is they're going to play it the next year in the middle  of the season.  Are they really?  That's dangerous.  How stupid is that? 
[01:44:30]  A little dangerous.  Because now you've got guys on the field.  It's their all-star game.  Your team is way out of it.  There's the star player that's looking like a Tom Brady or whoever is going to make a  run for the Super Bowl next year.  And now you've got a shot to just take him out in a game that doesn't matter.  But also, even when you're not out of it, and I bet you the NFL will make some kind  of rule like, no, if you're voting into this game, you have to play a minimum  of whatever.  Or a half or a quarter or something.  I bet you.  But say two teams are fighting it out, and say the Jets run second to Miami, and Miami's 
[01:45:00]  quarterback is quarterback.  You know what I mean?  It's almost like, but then again, you play AFC against NFC, so you're not going to have  the division rivalry, so maybe that won't matter as much.  But it's just stupid.  A chance for these guys to get hurt in the middle of the season?  How is that going to work?  They should just give up on it and realize there's not much they can do with their sport.  No one cares about it.  No.  It's going to bomb.  I love football.  I haven't taken a look at a Pro Bowl, and I can't remember the last time.  Pro Bowl. 
[01:45:30]  You can't root for any team.  You know?  It's like a big cluster F of people.  Yeah.  From various teams.  Let's say hi to Tim in Boston.  Tim?  I had a question for Anthony.  I was thinking that perhaps with the estranged relationship with Charles Widmore and the island  jumping around after time, James, maybe not dead?  Oh, well.  James Widmore.  He's a lost reference.  Thank you.  Who was he in lost? 
[01:46:00]  I didn't see the season.  He wasn't.  Oh.  Charles Widmore is another guy looking for the island.  He has a relationship with Ben that we don't really know about.  Right.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  He just briefed you.  Okay.  Phones are lit, which means we said something wrong.  Jack in South Carolina.  Jack?  Hey, fellas.  Just want to let you know, the Pro Bowl next year is going to be in Miami, and it will be  played the week before the Super Bowl.  It'll be during the off week.  What?  Yeah.  But the guys that are in the Super Bowl would most likely be the guys that would be invited 
[01:46:30]  to the Pro Bowl.  Well, they won't play anyways.  But at least it's better than having it during the middle of the season.  That's just stupid.  So it'll be all these.  Here's what that is.  It'll be a way to get people whose teams are not in the Super Bowl interested in the Pro  Bowl because they'll get to see their players.  But a lot of them will be depressed because their teams are out of it.  Right.  And there's no way if you're in the Super Bowl that you're going to let your guys play  in the Pro Bowl unless the NFL insists on it somehow.  They can't.  It's just a fix just to keep people watching. 
[01:47:00]  Because no one's going to watch it if it's after the Super Bowl.  But you might watch it if it's before the Super Bowl.  I think the NFL is frustrated because they see Major League Baseball always has an amazing  All-Star game.  It's a lot of fun to see those guys.  The NBA with the slam dunk competition and their All-Star weekend and hockey has the  skills competition now.  It's exciting.  Football, it just sits there.  And they probably think they're going to be able to charge a lot of money for commercials  because it's a lead up to a Super Bowl.  They're going to probably do a halftime show. 
[01:47:30]  They want to make two Super Bowls.  It's a revenue stream for the NFL.  That's all they're thinking.  Good luck.  Thanks, Jack, for that info, man.  They're trying to fill their pocketbooks.  Their pocketbooks.  They got us by the purse strings.  They sure do.  They sure do.  Let's go to the FU line and we'll continue.  Opie and Anthony.  Phones are lit if you want in.  877-212-ON-A.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have eight new voice messages.

Yeah, I want to give a big FU to those jerk-offs that robbed my apartment and thought that they

I'd like to give a big FU to the guy that calls up our certain regular rock station in  New York and asks for a song that we've heard 10 million times.  Hey, stupid, don't pick Under the Bridge by Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Nobody wants to hear it.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, hi.  I'd like to leave a big FU for my boss.

[01:49:30]  Fuck you, Mariano.  Next message.  Hi, I just want to give a big fuck you to everyone because I'm a real people person and  because I can.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  It doesn't matter what you do for a living.  This sucks.  It's true.  We know we have great, can't even call them jobs.  Yeah, I was telling somebody this weekend, I said, the worst part of my job is the getting 
[01:50:00]  up in the morning.  Yeah.  Everything else is just gravy.  You just, it doesn't matter.  You're having fun.  You get to goof on your friends, goof on other people, whatever.  But that getting up part is just, ugh.  The alarm went off this morning and I yelled at God.  God?  That's your alarm?  Weird stuff comes out of my mouth when that alarm goes off at 4.30.  I was, oh no, dear God. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No.  I had a, I had a bit of a headache this morning too.  I woke up at about 2 o'clock in the morning and was like, oh God, I hope this is done  by the time I have to get up.  So I popped a couple of aspirins because, well, when Mom and Sal come over, there's going  to be some drinking happening.  Well, all those Bud Lights, was that you?  That was me and Mom.  Ow.  Yeah.  Very impressive.  And then thanks to Danny, there was one Guinness left. 
[01:51:00]  And you enjoyed that.  So I polished that off.  And then when that was gone, there was no beer left or anything, so I had to switch to  wine.  Vodka and tomato and V8.  I like a Bloody Mary.  I don't get it, man.  I'll say it again.  That was my nightcap.  If I did the amount of drinking you did yesterday, I would not be here.  Yeah.  And you can't even tell.  No.  No.  That's so weird.  I don't build up a tolerance.  You know how they talk about the Alki's doing that.  Do you think you're an Alki? 
[01:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm what they call functional alcoholic.  You really are.  I function.  How many days do you think you could go without alcohol?  I've gone plenty of days.  Like when I had...  But that's because you have to.  Like if someone just said, look, you...  I don't know.  Stop drinking right now.  How long do you think you would last before you would just be a total freak out?  Actually, as long as it's not permanent, as long as I need to.  Like when I had my hair restoration done.  Plugs.  Hair plugs.  No, it's hair restoration. 
[01:52:00]  Individual follicles are placed in your head exactly the way they grew naturally.  Yeah.  And where do they get that hair?  From the harvest area on the back of your head.  They harvest it.  By the way, people are sick of you saying ought five.  That's Brooks.  Ought five.  Ought five.  Oh, I've been here.  Let's see.  I came in ought five.  People are begging you to stop saying ought five.  Ought five.  It's come up a lot lately.  And Brooks is a douche.  Hang yourself. 
[01:52:30]  People aren't...  They're not sure if they want to hear ought five or costume.  Costume.  But that's Sam's thing.  Costume.  He says like that, shh, shh, shh, costume, costume, costume, costume, and his mouth goes  costume.  Costume.  But when I had that done, I couldn't drink for a week and a half because of, you know,  it thins the blood and they don't want that bleeding and pop the follicles out of your head.  No, I was, you know.  You were good.  I was...  Our favorite shrink is on the line. 
[01:53:00]  Did I want a beer?  I certainly did.  Well, our favorite shrink's on the line, Lydia.  All right.  With the horrible voice.  Lydia, Oceanside.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Good morning.  What's up?  Our favorite analyst.  I wanted to know, Anthony, what makes you decide that the last drink of the night is  the last drink?  Like, how do you know?  The floor.  And the floor meets my face.  It's the last drink.  He knows he's had his last drink when the alarm goes off and it's spilled next to him. 
[01:53:30]  Last night, I was in bed and asleep relatively early.  Mom and Sal left and I shut everything down and just went up to bed.  So, I think I was asleep and done with my drinking by, what, 8.30, 9 o'clock, somewhere around there.  That's pretty awesome.  Wow.  What time did you start?  I started when everyone starts on a Sunday, noon. 
[01:54:00]  For real?  No, I think I woke up.  Let me think.  No, it probably was about noon.  Yeah, I had my first beer, cracked open my first Bud Light about noon.  What I'm hearing is that, like, being out of beer wasn't enough to stop.  Then you had a Bloody Mary.  I wasn't done drinking.  I was out of beer, but I wasn't finished with my drinking.  So, I made myself a drink.  When I don't want to drink anymore or I'm vomiting. 
[01:54:30]  Yes.  When he's pulling a Bond Scott in the back of his Escalator.  I guess when, yeah, when I feel I'm done.  Like, when I'm done.  How do you know when you're done?  What is that?  Can I just ask you, what are you getting at?  What do you want to say?  I'm just trying to diagnose you after a two-minute phone call.  I love that picture.  Lydia, you don't think we're on to you?  No, go ahead, Lydia.  If I said, I drink until I feel like going to sleep. 
[01:55:00]  I'm curious.  I'm truly just curious as to what the internal cue is that you're done.  I don't think about it that much like an analyst.  I just think I'm drinking and then I don't want to drink anymore, so I stop.  If I know I have to get up for work, I don't drink as late as I would on a weekend.  I'll tell you what his internal cue is.  When he goes to put a rock in front of the door and he realizes it's his liver. 
[01:55:30]  I don't know why he'd put a rock in front of the door.  I couldn't afford that one.  The liver's funny.  Hey, Lydia.  Yes?  Yes.  Anthony loves his drinking, so what's the problem?  I didn't say there was a problem.  Some people, I think, you know, let him drink.  Probably not something that I should be saying, but some people, it's what they want to do.  No, I just don't know what she's getting at, because she might have a valid point here, but I don't know what it is. 
[01:56:00]  I don't know what you're getting at.  My cue is that on the weekdays, I don't drink as long or as late as I do on the weekends.  So, on the weeknights, you would keep drinking, but you decide not to.  Until I pull a patent leather shoe and a ribbon out of my grill.  And you have vague memories of the night before of sad faces in the rearview mirror. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, I gave you my opinion on that relationship.  Somebody running after you with a pen and a notebook trying to jot something down.  Very concerned and squinting.  Yeah.  I knew Likolini wasn't for you.  Oh, Lydia.  I guess what I'm getting at, Ant, is that most people drink until they feel high.  Yeah.  And then they stop, and when their feeling goes away, they drink a little more. 
[01:57:00]  No, you've got to perpetuate the buzz.  No one drinks until they're high and then stops to get a hangover and then starts drinking again.  Once you start, you keep the buzz level up.  Or, if it's a weekend and you want to get effed up, then you're doing shots and stuff.  But if you're drinking beer, you keep your buzz going in a steady, you know, pace.  You know what I mean?  What's the matter?  You don't know how to drink? 
[01:57:30]  I don't know how to drink.  I just approach it differently than you, I believe.  No, it's almost impossible to stop drinking when you get that high.  Once you start drinking beer, especially beer.  Beer on a weekend is king.  You just sit there and drink it like a soda pop, and you catch a buzz.  You're not to the point where you're all effed up, but you've got a nice buzz throughout the day.  That's where your tolerance comes in.  It's nice and cold.  I would be puking if I drank as much beer as you did. 
[01:58:00]  Lydia, how much alcohol does it take for you to get this high and then you stop?  Um, I guess three drinks.  Three drinks.  Three drinks is about where, get what gets me high.  And then I have to stop till I feel like I have, I need some more.  I need some time in between that third drink.  It's so funny.  Yeah, Jimmy's just making me laugh.  He's laughing. 
[01:58:30]  Just making me laugh.  Wow, Lydia.  Do you get a little loose after your three drinks?  Yeah, loosey-goosey.  What do you do?  What do I do when I have three drinks?  Yeah, do you get to the point where you might give up the old back end?  Yeah, you're giving up some stuff.  It takes a lot more drinks than that.  Yeah?  That takes a lot more than three.  Ether on a rag?  That's right.  Three drinks makes me pleasant.  Pleasant?  Pleasant.  Well, why don't you have three drinks before you call next time? 
[01:59:00]  No, it's a little too early for me for that, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Lydia.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  There she is.  Lydia's trying to figure Anthony out.  She loves trying to figure me out, whether it's me being a nut job.  She wants to cure you of your whatever.  My paranoia, my racism, my drinking.  She wants to help me all the time.  Hey, can we take a listen to Please Read the Letter?  Robert Plant won Record of the Year. 
[01:59:30]  Record of the Year with the Grammys is this is the song.  Yeah?  This is it.  This was deemed the best song of the year.  Best song of the year.  Yeah, because they have other categories.  Well, then they have Song of the Year, which I don't understand how that's different from Record of the Year.  And you would think Record of the Year.  I was, that's exactly where I was going at, Jimmy.  No, that would be Album of the Year.  There's Album of the Year, then there's Record of the Year, which is just one song off the album.  And then there's Song of the Year.  But that's what Song of the Year is Record of the Year.  Huh?  Yes.  What?  What?  Writing and then Performing. 
[02:00:00]  So Record of the Year is the writing?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's the best written song?  And then...  Wait, who won Song of the Year?  How do you distinguish that?  Song of the Year was Coldplay.  That's writing.  So if you write a good song, but it wasn't performed well, then what happens?  I don't know.  This is stupid.  Seriously, what's the difference?  That's the difference.  If a song is well written, it's going to sound really cool.  Does Joe Satriani want it?  Record of the Year goes to the artist and to the producers, recording engineers, and mixers. 
[02:00:30]  And then what does Song of the Year go to?  All right.  Album of the Year goes to the producers.  All right.  Let's get to Song of the Year here.  Song of the Year is a songwriter's award.  So it just goes to the writers.  Mm-hmm.  And a lot of people are saying that Coldplay ripped off Joe Satriani, so that's why Jimmy said what he said.  Supposedly, Joe Satriani was going to the Grammys to serve Coldplay some papers.  Oh, really?  Coldplay is avoiding the Joe Satriani thing. 
[02:01:00]  Right?  Yeah.  His lawyers say that they keep avoiding him.  Right.  But what, he couldn't get in?  I don't know.  It's not true.  I don't have an update.  So, record of the year, please read the letter.  Robert Plant and Alison Cross.  We've talked about these two.  Robert Plant, of course.  Is it Cross or Crowley, Alison?  I think it's Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  Krauss.  And they've been at it for a while now.  They're just a huge hit together.  Can I hear this record of the year?  Please read the letter. 
[02:01:30]  Or a piece.  Now listen, and really, would you like this?  It's probably cool to say no, but really listen.  Who's singing?  That's Robert.  No, it's not.  What happened?  Please read the letter.  You know, sometimes a plane crash, a nut shooting you in the head, whatever happens, 
[02:02:00]  sometimes you just got to take it as, ah, you don't like this?  They're a legend forever now.  Instead of turning into this. 
[02:02:30]  What is this?  What's wrong here?  This sucks.  I'm trying to see if.  A big one.  I'm trying to see if I would like this.  I actually like, I got to be honest.  I knew Jimmy would like it.  I do like it, man.  I don't know.  Would you put this on your?  Oh, without a doubt.  On your phone?  But I liked Robert Plant's other stuff that, remember me and you went and saw him at X10  that time?  Like that album he promoted, I kind of like, ah.  It was cool.  Yeah.  But it was different than this.  This is really, like, mellow.  I like this. 
[02:03:00]  You should know that they didn't steal it, except one.  Could be the email.  Please read the letter.  The Twitter notification that I sent.  Please read my blog.  My short little blog.  Only 120 characters.  I don't know.  I'm not.  I'm really trying, and I don't know.  I don't know what I would do with this song if it was on the radio.  I think I would have to turn it off. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, that's a good indicator.  If this just came on your radio, would you listen to it or go like, not even think twice  and go, I want to hear something else?  But he's huge with this Allison Krauss.  This is the upper end of Plant's Range these days.  They won album of the year.  This is his high notes.  He's straining to get this out.  But they won album of the year.  I know.  Meaning the whole album now.  Yeah.  Not to be confused, a record of the year.  I think they won two different songs, won two different awards on that album. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, they won all sorts of stuff all over the place.  I don't know.  Isn't it the best song by a guy with a head the size of a tyrannosaurus?  I believe that's the criteria.  I was lucky enough to get a picture with Robert Plant because of Jimmy, because I was going to bail.  We were at XM and Jimmy got right in there because he's not going to accept no for an answer.  And then Jimmy looks at me like, well, what are you going to do?  And I'm like, ah.  And Jimmy actually grabbed him and said, could you do one more?  And my picture, I'll tweet it tonight. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Robert Plant's effing head, like you said, is twice the size of mine.  And you would think, all right, you must.  Forrest perspective.  Right.  You must have been, you know, further in the shot, like behind him a little bit.  No.  I swear to you.  When I show you this picture.  Well, there's a better example right there.  Jimmy and Robert Plant, the same thing.  We look like lovers.  That looks like one of the.  Put that up on O.N.A. Radio.  The moons of Jupiter.  Okay, there's mine, too.  Look at how big his head is.  That is a giant Robert Plant head. 
[02:05:00]  The award should be best crooning from an Easter Island statue.  Look at it.  Oh, my God.  I am slightly behind him to keep it a little fair.  It's Opie and Rocky Dennis.  He looks so much happier with me, though, doesn't he?  Yes, he does.  Well, because you bothered him.  I'm always the one more guy.  I got a picture with Sting where he just hates me because I asked for a second picture because my flash didn't go off.  Yes, he does.  He's smiling. 
[02:05:30]  You're like cheek to cheek.  He's coyly smiling.  Yes.  His locks are brushing me.  Yeah.  And Master Poe actually bodyguarded him for the day and got him to sign my picture and got him to sign a CD, which was very cool.  No, Jimmy got mine signed, too.  I got a Robert Plant autograph.  That's one of my prized possessions.  So, Mr. Plant, have you ever been in a band?  He had no idea who Led Zeppelin was.  Of course.  Look at his locks in front of my face.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, look, one of his curly locks is right in front of Jimmy's face. 
[02:06:00]  Yes, as two lovers would lay.  Yes.  That is exactly it.  You're the bitch in that picture, by the way.  Yes.  I'm saying my neck is fat, and he apparently wrote a letter about it.  He's saying, please read the letter that I stape tape to your fat neck.  Stape tape?  Yes.  It was going to be stapled and taped.  It's a new technology, which where a staple gun puts tape out.  It's called stape-ing.  Right?  It's crushed it in my mouth.  My mistake.  Stape-ing.  Jimmy, you're the worst, though, because you don't even like Zeppelin. 
[02:06:30]  I like Zeppelin.  You look like you love him in this picture.  He was great that day.  He was fun to watch, and I do like Zeppelin.  It doesn't matter if Jimmy likes or dislikes a celebrity.  When he takes a picture with it, he's thrilled, like a little kid.  Growing up, Zeppelin was pretty much the first rock band I got into.  And you fast forward a few decades, and all of a sudden, Jimmy and I saw him rehearsing.  It was us and ten other people in a room.  Not even ten.  There was one point where it was Robert Plant and his band.  And us?  And me and you.  And that was it. 
[02:07:00]  Awkward.  And he's still doing the Zeppelin hip stuff, and we're like, what are you doing?  It's just us dudes, man.  Didn't you see a huge hog?  Yes.  He's still doing the huge hog thing.  I think he's packing.  I think he's putting something in his pants.  Yeah, but it was just us and his band.  I was like, this is the weirdest moment ever, man.  Yeah, this was Robert.  He was probably singing from where Travis is to where I am, about ten feet away is where  he was singing.  And we were just kind of sitting there watching him warm up with his band. 
[02:07:30]  It was really cool.  I don't know why we were allowed in there.  Why were we allowed in there?  Because we were just employees.  No one else was allowed.  We just went in to watch some of the rehearsal.  I think we just walked in and sat down.  And he said, ah, all right, what the hell.  Yeah, we looked like we belonged there.  We could have been an engineer.  He didn't know who we were.  We did?  Really?  All right, we're out of here.  I want to say hi to this guy here, Neat Eagle on Pal Talk.  Where do you get your diabetes medication?  Oh, wow.  That's the visual of the day. 
[02:08:00]  That's the visual of the day.  We do radio, but that's a good visual right there.  Wilford Brimley.  Sure does.  I got the diabetes.  Liberty Medical Supplies for your diabetes.  All right.  We out?  Yeah, I guess we out today.  Erky-durky.  See you over the other side.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right. 
[02:08:30]  Continuing with the Opie and Anthony show.  Man, we were hoping to call it in today, but then we walked in and there's a fucking big  audience.  So now we got to do more radio for everybody.  Yeah.  You guys suck.  You couldn't come here on a Tuesday or a Wednesday.  Mondays we like to coast like everybody else.  Yeah, fuck off a little at work.  The word got out that this is going away in another month, month and a half as far as 
[02:09:00]  the live audience.  So the crowds are starting to get bigger.  Usually on a Monday, there's one douche out there.  Today, we got 15 douches.  It's like, there's only one week left of Les Miserables.  Right.  Get your tickets now.  And then they pack out.  Meanwhile, they're closing because no one was going.  You know what?  All right.  Let's use that to go with this.  You know what?  After Friday, it's it.  Miss Saigon closing down.  Cats now and forever at the Winter Garden Theater. 
[02:09:30]  How do you remember Winter Garden Theater?  I remember every commercial.  I know, but.  I remember commercials.  I know.  Commercials.  I have commercials in my head.  I know them all.  Yeah, give me one.  Give me one.  Plop, plop.  Fizz, fizz.  That's the easy one.  Oh, what a relief it is.  I can even come up with that one.  Yeah.  Give me an obscure one.  Uh, you've come a long way, baby, to get where you got to today.  You've got your own cigarette now, baby.  You've come a long, long way. 
[02:10:00]  It's, um.  Don't tell me what cigarette.  Well, what else would a bitch cigarette be?  A bitch cigarette?  One that you never got to bum off a fucking person.  Virginia Slims.  Right.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Virginia Slims?  That's the only bitch cigarette I can think of.  Yeah.  Is there another bitch cigarette?  It's like, you got to, yeah, well, they came up with a couple of bitch cigarettes after  vagina Slims.  Um, what was the one?  Well, there's, uh, Travis just reminded me about Capri's.  Capri's.  Capri's.  Capri's.  It was those cigarettes, it's like, hey, you got a cigarette? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  And then this chick would, like, pull out her vagina Slims, and you're like, I can't  smoke this.  And, and the only reason.  It's Slim like a bitch.  And the only reason you were smoking, especially back then, was to look cool.  Yeah, yeah.  So you didn't want, like, a, you didn't want the cigarette to look, like, whatever,  faggy.  If you bummed a cigarette and someone pulled out a fucking box of Marlboro Red, it was  just the shit right there.  That was the shit.  Or the camels without the filter.  Non-filter.  Boy, was that harsh.  I used to, uh.  It was a harsh smoke.  When I was living over, uh, my friend's house, his mom would smoke Paul Mall. 
[02:11:00]  Paul Mall.  Non-mental, uh, non-filtered.  That's cancer in a box.  That is like, that is like the HOV lane to cancer.  Those cigarettes.  Had to bum them, though.  Holy shit.  Had to bum them.  But, what I would do is take cancer in those cigarettes.  I took the nasty old filter from the butt that was in the ashtray from, like, one of  my Marlboros, and I would, like, put it onto the Paul Mall.  Because you even knew.  So I could smoke it through a filter. 
[02:11:30]  You even knew.  But sometimes I had no cigarettes, no bustle left, nothing.  But sometimes the cigarette butt was, like, hard because it had been there so long.  Oh, yeah.  It was like, you know, just pull a butt out of the ashtray and try to straighten it out  and it just cracks.  Because that's all the, that's all the gook in your mouth, like, just turning into cement.  It's all this hard, too, that just kind of, like, you know, hardened.  But, uh, the, um, the Paul Mall was, like, the worst, smoking those non-filtered, just  ugh.  Someone was saying that, uh, Marlboro, well, I'll let Tom say it.  Tom, go ahead.  Hey, guys. 
[02:12:00]  How's it going?  Good, man.  Marlboro actually was originally marketed as a chick cigarette.  No.  And that marketing failed.  They throw a dude on a horse with a Marlboro and off you go.  Well, how was it marketed to bitches?  Yeah.  I don't remember.  I don't know how the marketing worked.  I just know that detail that it was originally meant for women.  I don't remember that.  Yeah, we'll have to look that up.  Well, before my time, I always remember the, uh, Marlboro Man.  Yeah.  Yeah, check out, have Stuntberry.  Check it, check that one out.  Stuntberry doesn't do this side of the show.  Lungs were riddled with cancer when he died. 
[02:12:30]  The Marlboro Man.  Oh, yeah.  Riddled?  Oh, yeah.  Riddled.  And then he was against smoking and all that?  The lung cancer, yeah, and then he came out against the cigarette smoking.  Can we get our old cigarette commercials?  I love those.  Ah, I love those.  Where they say doctor approved and all that crap.  Nine out of ten doctors smoke Marlboros.  It's a smooth pull on a food cigarette.  Jimmy, what happened?  You'll love it.  What happened?  What phone is bothering you today?  Oh, no.  It better not be that phone. 
[02:13:00]  I'm going to guess it's the BlackBerry.  No.  The iPhone.  Sorry.  It threw you offline again.  I was on the computer and it threw me offline.  Wait, you told me when you got a new phone that you would let me see your iPhone.  Is it today the day?  Oh, shit.  No, because I haven't transferred all the information.  But then you can see it.  No, but I'm thinking of getting an iPhone.  Let me just see how it feels in my hand.  No, I don't want you to see how it feels in your hand.  Why?  He might bust it.  I ain't going to.  That's the obvious thing.  I bet you'll bust it.  Give me this, fatty.  Oh, fuck.  We have Greg Gutfeld.  By the way, we have Greg Gutfeld coming in in six minutes. 
[02:13:30]  Oh!  From Red Eye, which I was supposed to be on tonight.  But thanks to President Obama doing his press conference.  Oh, he's doing his first press conference of his presidency.  So he's going to, you know, get in front of the press and they're going to ask him softball fucking questions.  I think he's going to apologize, too.  He's going to demand that Poland apologize for bloodying the knife of those Pakistani militants with the head of one of their citizens.  Fucking annoys me.  Oh! 
[02:14:00]  Farm policy.  So far.  Stinks.  Let's see what happens when they send Hillary over there to chat with some of those people.  Oh, boy.  Ahmadinejad seems to be in an election coming up.  That's why he's talking tough.  Yeah.  Well.  But they don't elect him.  It's hysterical.  What are they talking about?  He's running against a real moderate Muslim.  A guy that can actually be spoken to and stuff like that.  And apparently it's a write-in.  You've got to write in his ballot.  And I'm just thinking that'll be the last thing you do with your hands. 
[02:14:30]  It's right in for that motherfucker.  Plus, we've all been in a cab.  How do you remember how to write the name?  Oh, please.  Well, I guess over there it would be easy, huh?  Well, you have to write those wacky symbols that they use for letters.  Not like real letters.  They got lazy or something.  What does that all mean?  That's why we'll never get along.  Who's going to try to learn their culture?  English is so simple.  Learn it.  Yeah.  A bunch of drivel symbols.  Yeah.  Oh, look.  It's a half a circle with two teeth in it. 
[02:15:00]  What does that mean?  You're assholes.  That's what it means.  Fucking nonsense.  Write the words.  Let me give you this today because we were talking about it.  It ain't well.  Hey!  Hey!  Newport tastes fresher, tastes better too.  Newport tastes fresher, tastes better too. 
[02:15:30]  Newport tastes fresher, tastes better too.  I don't know.  That any other memphro cigarette.  Newport tastes fresher, tastes better too.  Nowadays it's smoked by a jig.  Climb!  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:16:00]  This is a fall flag.  That any...  There's always such a...  The chicks that sang those things, they should be on that Art of the Topless.  They sound like that Art of the Topless girls.  You know they were goers.  Which one?  Of course they smoked cigarettes.  Yeah, that's the one I was looking for.  All right.  Yeah.  I took a chance there.  I failed miserably.  This is the one where the doctors talk about smoking. 
[02:16:30]  This is the one we wanted.  According to a recent nationwide survey, more doctors smoke camels than any other cigarette.  Fucking assholes.  Yes.  Fucking assholes.  Than any other cigarette.  More doctors.  They knew what they were doing.  Yeah.  According to a recent nationwide survey, more doctors smoke camels than any other cigarette.  Three leading independent research organizations ask this question of 113,597 doctors.  Wow. 
[02:17:00]  What?  How did they get that info?  That's some number.  You think the doctors just willingly offer that up, or was there some trickery involved?  They walk into the ER, and over an open patient, look at what the doctor is smoking at the  time, as his ashes are falling in the patient.  They look at the cigarette and go, hey, it's a camel.  Right.  What cigarette do you smoke, doctor?  The brand name most was Camel.  Now, you probably enjoy rich, full flavor and cool mildness in a cigarette just as much 
[02:17:30]  as doctors do.  That's why.  God damn it.  They were just fucking people over, man.  We wonder why they fucking came down so hard on these scumbags.  Every penny they lose in those lawsuits makes me happy.  Yeah, it really is.  It's just, they were completely fucking with us.  Not only just people.  They can't just say, like, hey, we surveyed a lot of people, and they seem to like camel.  Yeah.  Doctors.  You know what is amazing to me?  If you talk to the older generation, they'll say stuff like, we just didn't know. 
[02:18:00]  Shut it.  You think they just didn't know?  No.  Like, there just wasn't info available yet?  Because now, I mean, all the evidence is out there, obviously.  Put it this way.  Why would they choose doctors to survey if they didn't want you to think it was safe knowing  that it wasn't safe?  Right.  Like, why not fucking iron workers?  Yeah, truck drivers.  Hey, truck drivers, iron workers.  Construction workers, sure.  Just the idea that they chose to survey doctors lets you know that there's a problem with 
[02:18:30]  these things that they're trying to quell by saying, look, doctors smoke it.  So you think the people knew, but it made them feel a little better that the doctors were  saying that it's okay?  The companies absolutely knew.  Oh, yeah.  I would say a lot of the people knew.  That were smoking?  But there were some people, probably morons, that who would think sucking smoke into your  lungs wasn't bad for you? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, it's easy to say that now.  That's what I mean.  Put yourself back then.  Like, would you know?  Yeah.  You think you would know?  I would know.  You have to know.  But wouldn't you just think your lungs could handle it?  Yes, my lungs can handle it.  No different than being stuck in a tunnel in your automobile back then.  You'll breathe in the same amount of smoke just walking the streets of your fair city.  Cigarettes are completely safe. 
[02:19:30]  Look, doctors are smoking them as they're turning away Negroes for emergency surgeries.  What cigarette do doctors flick at Negroes more than any other cigarette?  Camel.  Camel.  Camel.  Yeah, we were goody-two-shoes back then, weren't we?  Oh, we certainly were.  We sure would put that image out there.  Yes.  There's horrific things going on. 
[02:20:00]  This is a cigarette just as much as doctors do.  And that's why, if you're not a camel smoker now, try a camel on your T-zone.  That's T for taste and T for throat.  Your true proving ground for any cigarette.  See if camel's rich flavor of superbly blended choice tobaccos isn't extra delightful to your taste.  See if camel's cool mildness isn't in harmony with your throat.  See if you two don't say, camel's suit my T-zone to a T. 
[02:20:30]  Camel suit my T-zone to a T.  He's right.  I say it all the time.  Camel suit my T-zone.  You can get to my T-zone, throw my mouth, or the hole in my neck.  They call it a T-zone because that's the shape that's removed from the throat.  Yeah.  Your trachea.  T as in tracheotomy.  If you didn't know any better, you would think they were describing like an ice cream sundae or something. 
[02:21:00]  I know.  It's the freshness and the coldness and the taste.  The taste zone and all this crap.  Mildness.  It's a cigarette.  It's wonderful.  Did you enjoy smoking when you were smoking?  Yeah.  Sometimes you did.  Yeah.  Like really enjoyed.  Sometimes.  Did you enjoy the act or the actual taste of the cigarette?  Everything ruled with cigarettes.  About it.  And especially when the first one of the morning was a little like, you're just getting it out of the way.  Yeah.  But when you are at a bar having some drinks and you got a cigarette in one hand, drink in the other, nothing better. 
[02:21:30]  I was the lame bar smoker.  I did it because I thought it was cool.  It was.  I never liked it.  It was.  I want all the kids to know that.  It's cool.  Sure.  It looks cool.  It looks cool, kids.  You'll be cooler.  Chicks will think you're cool.  Anthony says, chicks will think you're cool.  Let's say hi to Nick in Atlanta.  He's got more info on this doctor thing and how they use the doctors to get us addicted to stuff.  Go ahead, Nick.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  Hey, I just wanted to let you guys know that Nathan's Hot Dogs started out basically exactly the same way. 
[02:22:00]  They would allow doctors to have free food when they would come out to the Nathan's Hot Dog stand if they wore their white jackets.  What?  Like dressed as a doctor?  And then you as the dumb civilian, like, oh, that must be good for you.  Look, doctor's eating the hot dogs.  Why is he smoking a hot dog?  Well, I was just trying to draw a line between the youth and the doctor.  We got it.  To promote something. 
[02:22:30]  Right on, man.  Nobody's confused.  Literal Nick.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Kimball in Baltimore.  Ah!  Yeah, my dad's a doctor, and he was there during the first couple of tests when they're bringing back these rats, telling them they got cancer.  And all the doctors are standing up in an auditorium full of smoke, and apparently the one guy in the back got up and told the one doctor that all he proved  was that rats shouldn't smoke, and they just kept smoking away.  Yeah.  Well, that's, you know, that was the beginning of when they started testing that, and it's got to be long enough ago where anyone that's alive now would have known that it's bad. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Tears and tumor.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Tears and tumor.  Your T-zone.  Yeah.  Your tumor zone.  Yeah.  Maybe Phillip and Morris didn't know it was bad for you.  Yeah.  We're fucking, we're Billy Newport.  We're fucking, we're Virginia Slim, who's actually the lady.  We're fucking Teddy Camel.  They knew that's what it is.  Of course, Paul Maul. 
[02:23:30]  Mr. Maul, it's smoking bad for you.  No.  No.  No.  They knew.  They put the filter to make it look like, ah, I see it, but this little filter takes care of all the badness.  The filter will filter out any danger.  Yeah, right.  Will it?  Let's say hi to Dan in Nebraska.  Dan.  Hello, Dan.  Hello.  Hey, Dan.  There was a Lucky Strike commercial, so round, so firm, so fully packed.  Oh, that sounds nice.  Like a well-fucked asshole.  That was actually in the commercial in the 50s. 
[02:24:00]  Lucky Google.  That's why they banned cigarette commercials.  Just the language.  They would have a black guy and a white woman and a tied-up white man, and they would say pound, round and packed, like a well-fucked asshole.  And the black guy's dick would look like fucking there was olive loaf hanging off of the whole fucking bleeding white lady's skin.  You think the ad man actually handed that in, and the boss had to sit him down and go, look, we can't describe it as a well-packed asshole.  No, they filmed it.  Can you go back to the drawing board and come up with something else, please? 
[02:24:30]  And then the problem was the language and the content, because he was smoking the fucking Paul Malls and he was putting them out on the white lady's back.  While the fucking cuckold husband was tied up with his glasses and his fucking bank book full of ill-gotten booty.  Holy shit.  Fucking awful.  That's terrible.  Looked like he stuck his dick in an olive and yanked it out quickly.  Fucking pimento hanging out of his big black cock hole.  Pink sock the white bitch. 
[02:25:00]  That was the tagline.  With a fucking unfiltered ciggy hanging out of his big lips.  As he's lipping it.  I'm serious.  He's hate.  Terrible.  I want to thank Mike from Fort Kent.  Could you look that up?  Mike!  Before everyone else doesn't fucks it up on us.  He's sending us somewhere with the show.  Let me go to Mike in the Bronx.  I'll explain if it's something worth talking about.  Mike, go ahead. 
[02:25:30]  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Big fan.  Listen, I came from Europe when I was five, Rome.  And in Italy and small towns in Europe, doctors are looked at differently than here in this country.  They're looked at as royalty.  People tip their hats to doctors.  So when cigarette companies were targeting European Americans, they used doctors because they were looked at on a higher regard than they were in America.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That's kind of what...  Are you guys speechless?  No, no, I'm just trying to figure that whole thing out because, you know, the American commercials. 
[02:26:00]  But, Anthony, just to let you know, too, that the cigarettes in Europe are different than in the United States.  Oh, shit.  That's why they go, ah, American cigarette, and they love them.  Yeah.  That's right.  They're a lot harder.  Anyway, you guys rule.  Stay strong, guys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Do you know the original Virginia Slim's commercial?  The reason they had to yank that is it was a woman, and she was smoking, and she was being rocked back and forth, and then it pulled back.  And you realized there was six guys surrounding her and fucking her, and the tagline was, Virginia Slim, a great ciggy to be raped to. 
[02:26:30]  How many airings did that get?  One.  There was a lot of complaints.  I wouldn't doubt it.  Somebody turned us on to, like, crash tests from the 60s.  Oh, wow.  That's what I had Danny find.  Look at how stupid we were back then.  Look at these safe automobiles.  We couldn't figure it out.  Look at these dummies just getting through the roof.  Look.  Bam.  Where do they find this?  Oh, a guy falls out of the door. 
[02:27:00]  If you just YouTube 1960s crash tests, people are just flying out of the car.  That's great.  There's, like, a few different parts.  As soon as you hit the car, all the doors just fly open.  Crash tests.  And the people are just all over the highway.  The crash test dummies in there just flying out of the windows, through the windshields.  How come they don't use real people for that, though, to get a better reading?  Oh, they should.  Criminals.  Why don't they use prisoners?  You know, that's what they should do, though.  You know, they should do that to fucking kid touches.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:27:30]  All right.  We get it.  You know, you take a rusty fucking tin can lid and just cut his balls off with it.  Yeah.  You shoot the hostage.  Shoot the hostage.  Mike in Fort Kent.  He was the one that sent this in.  You got something else to add, Mike, or you just need the credit today?  I was just wondering if you guys got it through.  And did you guys see the one where they were doing the T-bone test and the fucking seats  come right out of the car and there's fucking dummies right underneath the car?  Yeah.  They didn't even know how to figure out how to keep the seats in place. 
[02:28:00]  So the seats just go flying sideways.  Well, look at that crash test E-Rock.  The 1960s, the Chevrolet pickups, they had the fucking gas tanks that were right in back  of the seat.  Yeah, I remember those.  Yeah, it's fucking ridiculous.  If you're in the backseat of that, you're so fucking dead.  We've come a long way with the car safety thing.  Fire.  Fire.  Well, punch it out, boys.  The car I want to get has this really weird thing where if you get rear-ended at more 
[02:28:30]  than three miles an hour, it violently ejects you through the roof.  What would that do?  There's no sunroof.  But you have to do this as a crank and you roll it down as the accident's happening and  then it ejects you.  Or else you just hit the fucking roof?  Yes, if you don't have a crank and you have to have somebody in the passenger seat doing  it, like cranking at the same time, you roll down the roof.  You are an asshole. 
[02:29:00]  No, but that's what you do.  But you've got to be careful because a lot of people have their legs ripped off while being  rocketed through the roof.  I read that.  You've got to watch that.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Sean.  Everybody's talking like we were only stupid back in the day, but didn't the FDA come out  like a handful of years ago and tell us that a pedron and diet pills was bad for us?  You know, you can see your heart actually beating in your chest, but that just means  it's working.  Yeah, like diet pills and shit like that. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, he makes a valid point.  We're not completely smart, that's for sure.  But I think a lot of people...  We've got a lot better.  I think a lot of people had to know that wasn't too good for you either.  Right.  As you're taking them.  I say no.  You need like the Surgeon General to determine that it's bad.  And then you're like...  Put it on something.  You know, we haven't even begun to talk about this octuplet thing.  The mom who had six kids at home and then had another eight.  Look at that fucking creature.  Jesus.  But she's insane. 
[02:30:00]  This woman is insane.  And she had eight kids.  Jesus.  And she already had six at home.  She now has 14 kids.  14 kids.  That's good.  Wow.  What does she do for a living?  Not much.  Not nothing?  Taking some of the kids away from her.  She runs her cunt out as a tunnel.  Yeah.  Fuck.  It's for good for storage.  Oh, God.  They're looking at the fertility doctor going, what the fuck were you thinking?  Yeah.  Is that...  Who is that...  Where's the mother?  See, look.  Mother of this woman says her daughter's actions are unc... 
[02:30:30]  Un...  Unconscionable.  They're all cute babies.  No, they're not.  They don't look cooked yet.  Wow, look.  They're all just tiny preemies.  They look like quatto.  Guato gave birth to eight quattos.  Quatto.  David in Washington.  David.  Yo.  Hey.  Hey, there's a commercial I think you guys should check out.  It's the Oovoo commercial.  O-O-V-O-O.  It is the ugliest, arrogant fucking little ass running like a business meeting. 
[02:31:00]  The whole commercial is just disgusting on every level.  I think you guys would be able to do about an hour's worth of material on it.  You've described it very, very well.  Well, all right.  We'll have the guys look at it in the back office there.  Thanks, sir.  Four.  All right.  Let's go to Debbie.  Debbie.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Debbie.  Hey.  She looks like Gene Simmons, by the way, the Octavius mother.  Oh, yeah.  She does.  She has Gene Simmons mouth.  Really?  I hate many babies.  I just had a question. 
[02:31:30]  Debbie, we're not talking.  We can't see you.  You're on the phone.  Yeah, we don't know what you look like.  Holy shit.  Not you.  You fucking dead bell.  We're talking about a woman on television.  That just gave birth to eight kids, even though she has six at home.  And then we said she looked like Gene Simmons, and you assumed we were talking about you.  How would we have seen you?  Sorry.  I thought you were talking about me.  But how would we have seen you?  I know.  I didn't hear that part.  But if you commented on how we thought you looked like Gene Simmons, how did you then 
[02:32:00]  think we saw you to describe that you looked like Gene Simmons?  I thought you said I sounded like her.  Gene Simmons is not a her.  I thought you said her mother.  Oh, my God.  You suck a cock.  I know.  Why don't we just read Dr. Seuss books today for everybody? 
[02:32:30]  Why don't we try?  Hey, listen.  I got a question for Opie real quick.  Yeah.  When you quit smoking, how long ago did you do it?  Oh, my God.  I barely smoked.  Oh, just tell her.  She's shy.  Go ahead, Deb.  I was a bar smoker.  I was the douche that thought he was cool when I was drinking.  You're a coal smoker.  And I would smoke a fucking cigarette every once in a while.  Anthony smoked for a while.  Jimmy smoked big time as well.  17 years, yeah.  17 years.  I probably had two dozen cigarettes in my life, if that many. 
[02:33:00]  Go ahead, Deb.  All right, all right.  Calm down.  I was going to ask Anthony, how long ago did he quit?  Oh, God.  You're probably fucking 10 years ago.  Maybe, yeah.  You went through.  I don't know, seven.  I quit just almost a year ago.  This is why I'm asking.  And how was your anxiety?  Did you just stay drunk or did you just take Valium or what?  Yeah, that's what I needed, just to not smoke.  Debbie, what is wrong with you?  I just, you stopped smoking. 
[02:33:30]  That's how you stopped smoking.  You stopped smoking.  Afterwards, didn't you just feel like a lot of anxiety?  No.  I felt like I wanted a cigarette, and then I said, I'm quitting, so I can't have one.  And then you don't.  That's what I did.  That's what I did.  I was just wondering if I was the only one that felt that way.  You're a fool.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Deb.  Godspeed.  Debbie, where are you driving to today?  I'm sorry?  Where are you driving to?  I am in Asheville, North Carolina.  Hopefully she's unknowingly driving into the rear end of a tractor trailer. 
[02:34:00]  Are you driving to your job?  Where are you driving to?  I live in Asheville, North Carolina.  Give me a fucking answer.  God damn.  No, I'm standing outside right now.  I'm not driving.  Should I go off like this?  Well, do you have a job?  I mean, what are you doing when you're not calling the show?  I have a job.  I listen to you guys all morning.  I do drive for a living, yes. 
[02:34:30]  You don't fucking understand.  I work for a transportation company.  Let's put it that way.  I'm not asking.  I'm telling you.  Oh.  What?  What are you telling me?  Fuck's sake, man.  You're amateur.  Give me a fucking answer.  Ann, calm down.  You got Ann all pissed off, Debbie.  Give me an answer, please.  What's the question?  No! 
[02:35:00]  He already told you the question.  He's mad now.  Hey, Bruce.  I'm going to fucking kick your fucking ass.  Give me a fucking answer.  Can you answer the question, please, Debbie?  The answer is no.  Are you professional or not?  Yes.  You're un-fucking-believable.  You prick.  Oh, da-da-da-da-da.  I love that.  Ah, ta-da-da-da. 
[02:35:30]  All right, listen, I got it.  I just want to fucking kill this woman.  No, you don't.  You would love me if you knew me.  You got the big...  What do you got going on?  You got the big boobies?  Thanks, you.  No, no.  What size?  I got everything else.  Do you have A-cup titties or B?  C.  C's are nice.  Saggy C's, right?  That's all they are.  I hope followed by an A-N-C-E-R.  You guys are hilarious. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, oh, duh.  Jesus.  I got to go.  I want to suckle your fat teardrop tits.  Would you go, lady?  Madam, get back here.  Madam.  I'm not finished with you toots.  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  It's my birthday.  How about you wrap those fucking giant utters around my dick and you talk while I come all  over your eyeballs?  I'll fucking...  I'll fuck your ears with my little finger.  Was she annoying?  She's the worst. 
[02:36:30]  God, you just get a couple of calls every so often that'll just really get to you.  I kind of liked her.  Yeah, of course you did.  Why not?  She was a fucking dummy prick.  Oh, I hate her.  All right, why don't we take a break and we'll continue.  Obama has a nice plane.  Obama?  Yeah.  Air Force One is the shit.  Doesn't it have the same plane?  Yeah.  Yep.  He actually has Snoop Dogg flying it now in Godfrey.  Oh, God.  What the hell was that movie called?  Soul Plane.  Soul Plane? 
[02:37:00]  You think it's like Soul Plane?  Yeah, it sure is.  Yeah.  Why would Steven S. Fabatio write, holy fuck, I hope this woman drowns to death in diarrhea?  I mean, she wasn't that bad.  People hated her.  Dude, they hated her.  To a point where you hope she drowns in diarrhea?  Yes.  Yes.  They hated her.  And how would you get that...  Jimmy, how would you get that done?  How do you drown in diarrhea?  You eat a lot of Mexican food and do a headstand.  Yeah?  Believe me, I've lost a couple of friends that way.  It's a lot easier than you think. 
[02:37:30]  Like, one giant dollop of liquid shit goes into your nose and you breathe it into your lungs.  You're like, what's worse than the cinnamon challenge?  All right, we've got another question.  I guess it's question day on the show.  Francis in Iowa.  Hey, guys.  Lighten up, Francis.  Then again, maybe one of us won't.  That's my middle name only.  You don't want to give me my real name.  Hey, guys.  I've been smoking some serious California reefer for the last ten months, and I'm down to my last couple buds.  But what kind of shit am I going to go through in the next couple days? 
[02:38:00]  Why are you quitting?  Because it's in California.  I'm in Bumpuck, Iowa.  And I'm running out.  So buy some more, you fucking boob.  It's pot.  It's not fucking uranium.  Jesus.  That's why he's smoking moon dust.  Fucking schmuck.  Moon dust.  You're in Iowa.  Fucking plant a tree in the yard.  Nobody will notice it.  Wow, there's a massive fire in a building in Beijing.  Oh, wow.  Hotel fire.  40-story building.  It's under construction. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, that thing is done.  So there's no one in there, which is good.  But I hope it fucking falls down just to shut some of these conspiracy assholes up that go,  That building burned, and it didn't fall down.  Just please, just fall down.  The fire is all the way up to the top.  Yeah, that is a fucking fire.  You think they're going to be able to save the building?  Yes.  What does Beijing have for a fire department?  Hey, what happened to the pot smoking guy?  I wanted to talk to him for a while.  You put out fire with paddy water. 
[02:39:00]  Jesus, what the fuck hotel was at?  It was the Grand Gasatorium.  They don't have rugs.  They would just pipe in gas, and you'd walk through.  It was a very popular hot spot for non-smokers.  How would that work, Jimmy?  After you get out of the shower, you have to tiptoe through your gas floors.  You know how dangerous that would be to stay there? 
[02:39:30]  Very apparently.  You smell like gas.  People get sick.  Yes, you can see.  It's very dangerous.  Something sparks up.  Yeah, 40 stories.  Because every story is on fire.  Every floor is on fire.  Every single one.  Would they use that?  All right, look.  We're building this, but in the meanwhile, let's store dry leaves on every floor.  I want all the dry leaves from this country to put them on every floor.  Dry leaves and cigarette butts.  Flick them in.  We'll put them out later.  You'd have to go, ow, ow, ow, for every floor on the way down. 
[02:40:00]  You don't even get a break if you're on the 40th floor all the way down.  It's hot.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Imagine some poor son of a bitch that thinks it's just in the stairwell a little bit and  goes, I think I could run through this.  Right.  Realizes it's 40 stories of flames.  Every fucking, when did they decide to put it out?  Did they go, look, it's only 17, 18 floors.  Let it go.  It'll burn itself out.  Wow.  When they pan down, it's just amazing.  Wow.  It is every floor.  That thing is fucked. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, it's horrible.  Massive fire.  It's amazing how different things are looked at over there.  They're calling it Singapore lightning.  Of course.  Here we call it.  Get the graphic off the screen, Fox News guy, cunts.  I know.  God, you can't even see half the fucking picture.  And we don't want to see the reporters, we want to see the fire.  I want to see the reporters and the fire together.  Well, that report is not fair.  Look at her.  Her?  I wouldn't mind giving her a smoke shot of the old...  Oh, my Odie meal is here! 
[02:41:00]  That's right.  Hold on a second.  Mine's here, too.  Take it out of my bed for me!  I'm yelling at Kenny like that.  Why did Starbucks chits on my Odie meal?  They sure did.  They only gave you a little bit...  Fucking change.  What the fuck am I going to do with this?  What is this shit?  Oh, what do you got?  Nuts?  Mix it up for me.  Don't put it on his head.  Oof.  Did you get more Odie meal than me?  No, say him out.  What the fuck is up with their Odie meal?  I don't know.  It's fucking horrible.  He's been losing to the track. 
[02:41:30]  He's had to cut back on the oatmeal.  Then you get no oatmeal.  A catty shag.  I did the stripes.  Yes.  You heard my stripes, right?  Of course.  Thank you.  Let's take a break.  We're going to eat our Odie meal.  Kenny, moisten my fruit in your mouth.  Too like a bird for Jimmy, please.  Yeah, Kenny, whenever I eat raisins, Kenny will hold my raisins in his mouth for a minute  and get them all nice and salivated.  You've got to get him hydrated.  Oh, God.  He'll plump up my raisins, and then he spits them on a plate, and I eat them. 
[02:42:00]  That is fucking disgusting.  I like him to moisten my raisins.  Who's willing to do some regurgitation today with Kenny?  Kenny, would you moisten up some raisins and then put them in someone's mouth today?  I have an idea.  Mouth to mouth.  How about you moisten my dickhead?  Oh, this stupid Alaskan volcano.  They're saying now it's going to erupt within days.  They've been saying that for days. 
[02:42:30]  They've been saying that for days.  Exactly.  That's why there's no real good video of Mount St. Helens or film, because they're like,  oh, any day now.  Anthony, by the way, we're going into break here.  I just want to remind people that Pro Flowers is the thing to do for this Valentine's Day.  Valentine's Day is what, Saturday?  Saturday.  I got to tell you, I mean, they talk about how the Wall Street Journal says it's the best value  and all that.  I mean, our listeners have used Pro Flowers over the years.  We have personally used Pro Flowers over the years. 
[02:43:00]  I send them out all the time, and the results are great every single time.  They've figured out how to do the flowers in the mail thing.  Finally.  Because it comes in a really nice box.  You open up the box, and these flowers, I don't know how they do it, but they're fresh  every single time.  They last for a long time.  And they got a nice deal for Valentine's Day.  What are they doing?  One dozen red roses and a free ruby red vase, or two dozen assorted roses and a free clear  glass vase.  Plus, they're going to throw in some truffles.  All for just $39.99, huh?  What a deal.  That certainly is a deal.

We have very good news for the live audience today.  What?  We're queer.  We picked the right day to come here.  We got a Dilbert update.  Dilbert?  Yes.  Now, oh, Sam is here. 
[02:44:30]  Sam just loves Dilbert.  Apparently, when we last left Dilbert, he had been fired from his job that he had been  at forever.  He got fired, and we were reading some other comics, and we thought for a second that maybe  Dogbert, his pet, was putting him through mock interviews to train him.  Yeah.  But I did a little back research, and what had happened was, as you'll see illustrated  in the top strip that I handed out to everyone, the stock in the company that Dilbert was 
[02:45:00]  working for, it fell to just a penny a share.  So, Dogbert was able to purchase 51% of the company.  Wait, wait, Dogbert owns the company?  Yeah.  Yeah, and so...  That's preposterous.  Why wouldn't he just hire him, then?  Well, that's what he was putting through all the rigorous tests.  It was a real interview.  It wasn't...  That's silly.  A dog owns the company.  So, Dogbert works for satellite radio?  Oh, I don't think I'm specific to the... 
[02:45:30]  I want to know, now, why is Tumor Body standing on the desk?  That's Dogbert.  He's the boss.  That's Dogbert, okay.  Dogbert's letting Dilbert's old boss know, your stock fell to a penny a share, so I bought  51% of the company.  Uh-oh.  I'll double my investment just by firing you.  And then he says to the boss, thanks for not being totally worthless.  And the guy goes, you're welcome.  Wow, that's a terrific one right there.  These are the things that keep the laughs coming.  That one was brilliant.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:46:00]  So worth being in thousands of newspapers.  How the fuck are they not putting...  Papers wonder why they're going under?  Save yourself the fucking page cost and don't print this one.  What is the reaction after you read this?  It's pretty funny.  It's the same reaction you have when you look down and you see a gum wrapper.  There's a non-reaction to it.  What?  Does even the drawings suck?  But you also have to know what's coming next.  You know what I mean?  What's this leading to?  Because now we're looking at Dilbert going to all types of different work areas and seeing 
[02:46:30]  what his experiences are there.  So he's up in his game, obviously.  Right.  Yeah.  So what do we got now, Sam?  Dilbert in sales?  Right.  Yeah.  Next, Dilbert would start working in sales.  And so this guy is talking to him and walking him through the office and saying, we had to  be more creative because of the soft economy.  Can I stop you there, Sam?  Sure.  A little observation.  What do you call Dilbert?  Oh, cigar body?  Cigar body.  Cigar body and tumor body is dog birth.  Yes.  Cigar body, also known as a.k.a. 
[02:47:00]  Dilbert.  You notice his tie has to be up in the air.  He's a little...  Well, it's always been that way, right?  Why?  Why is that?  He's disheveled, you know?  Yeah, but why wouldn't the boss go, look, fix your fucking tire?  I think it's a subliminal boner.  Oh, my goodness.  It sort of looks like he's trying to suck his own dick.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  He's average a fishing hook, and apparently there's a pier, and someone says, I'm going  to fish for an unfunny cigar body cartoon, and they caught one.  Whoever draws this, you get fucking finger cancer. 
[02:47:30]  How great would that be if their fingertips had to be amputated due to fucking finger tumors  that look like dog birds?  But he insists on continuing, so now he does the cartoon with his mouth?  Yes, right.  Now, cigar body looks really awful.  Looks more realistic.  Dilbert and Zell, we had to be more creative because of the soft economy.  All right, continue there, Sam.  Right, and so now this new guy who's showing them around says, now we kill our customers  and replace them with body doubles who place big orders.  And then in the next frame, there's some, I guess, woman who says, who's the handsome 
[02:48:00]  new sales guy?  And then the boss says, he's you in about 10 minutes, referring to Dilbert, of course.  And then she says, what do you mean?  And he says, well, he's going to have his cock cut off and be made into a woman.  So we'll have two lungs with vaginas running around this office.  No.  That was the end of the cartoon?  What does that mean?  I think it's, maybe it's a commentary on the high turnover rate going on in a lot of  companies.  So Dilbert is now going to be, I don't get it. 
[02:48:30]  Dilbert, they're firing the bitch.  Here's what happened.  They hired Dilbert.  And she has been seen as an albatross in the company.  Yes.  Because her giant vagina has been swallowing up desks and typewriters and computer monitors.  Her name is old big pussy Bertha.  And they have to get rid of that black hole.  And she's a flatso.  Thank you.  Anyone else notice that the big fat broad doesn't have that?  She's the worst.  And now I'm looking at the next line of cartoons, the three panels, and there's a little shit 
[02:49:00]  nugget on the desk.  There's a tiny little shit nugget.  Yeah, who's the shit nugget, Sam?  You're way off.  That's Catbert.  What is, everybody has to be Bert.  It's just one of the cute things.  It's like ongoing.  You enjoy this, this funny, this comic?  It's funny.  You like the Catbert?  Who do you like best?  Cigar body, dog Bert, or Catbert?  Or nugget, or shit nugget.  Cigar body, shit nugget, and tumor body.  Yeah.  Right.  Which one do you like the best?  Well, of course, you know, cigar body. 
[02:49:30]  Well, Dilbert.  We'll call him Dilbert.  No, well, no.  Cigar body.  Cigar body.  Okay, well, he's my favorite because he's the classic.  But every now and then I get excited because a Catbert appearance is not as common as, say,  a dog bird.  That's not his name.  Yeah.  I mean, shit lump.  The top of Dilbert's head looks like an unclipped cock.  Like you're waiting for a head to come sliding out of it.  Jesus.  Well, this comic is called Catbert, Evil Director of Human Resources.  Oh.  Yeah, it's funny.  Dog Bert appointed Cat Bert to be head of human resources? 
[02:50:00]  That's crazy.  Why would a dog appoint a cat?  Yep.  Known enemies.  Yeah, they're too busy licking their own assholes.  Yeah.  When do they have time to do all this?  Exactly.  You'd be able to pilfer from the company, not show up for work, and still get paid because  a cat and a dog are in charge of things.  Yes, your boss is burying his own shit in a box in the corner, and then your other boss  is licking his balls under a table.  What the fuck do you got in front of you?  Oh, it's just protein powder.  Oh, fuck.  Dude.  That is a giant, giant jar. 
[02:50:30]  It's only $90.  It's giant.  It's the biggest jar I've ever seen.  What does it say on the front?  It's pro-complex.  I was supposed to get it.  Steve's chick actually came over yesterday and walked me through a whole bunch of exercise  and foods, and this Rocky Road pro-complex is probably pretty good for you.  That's fine, but the container comes in as hilarious.  No one needs that much of anything unless there's cunts in there.  There are.  It is actually pro-complex. 
[02:51:00]  There are prostitutes.  That's what that's short for.  It's in their badges.  Ouch.  Just imagine your multiple vitamin jar.  Yeah.  If it was 50 times larger.  It's huge.  Oh, look.  I feel like I mentioned her.  Oh, look at my boy.  Oh, look at your hat.  Oh, very distracting.  It's giant.  It's giant.  It's a good protein.  It's a good meal replacement.  All right.  No sugars.  All right, let's get back to this Dilbert.  So who's the...  Anyway, Dilbert.  So the cat... 
[02:51:30]  Catbert.  No, what is it?  The shitpert?  Shit nugget.  Shit nugget.  Shit nugget is now the human resource label.  The director of human resources.  All right, let's go.  And he says, your boss says you refuse to do your job.  And then Dilbert says, he told me to kill a customer, assume her identity, and place  a huge order with our company.  And then Catbert says, I'll transfer you to the collections department until you're willing  to kill. 
[02:52:00]  Uh-huh.  So that's the end of that day's comic.  If you...  That's how it ended?  Yes.  Until...  They always leave him laughing.  Right.  Until tomorrow.  Not...  And look, we have a live audience today.  Not one...  Not even a chuckle.  Not even a...  Not even a smirk.  Not even...  Nothing.  But this continues to take up space in our newspapers.  Fucking funny.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul in Virginia.  Paul.  Hey, Sam, don't forget about Ratbert.  There's a Ratbert, too?  We haven't met Ratbert yet.  Yeah, there's a rat.  Oh, yeah, you guys were asking about Dilbert's necktie. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  And they made some lame joke about that in the comics that Dogbert said, the reason your  tie stands up is because it's trying to get away from you because you're such a loser.  Aw, that's funny.  It's kind of fun.  Poor Dilbert.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  When your own dog is insulting your fishhook tie, you just can't win for losing this guy.  Is this a whole week of comics you brought us today?  Yeah.  You wanted the update.  That's terrific.  Thank you.  We haven't done it in a week. 
[02:53:00]  Now the next one is?  Dilbert is now working in collections.  Wow.  They're moving around.  To where Catbert assigned him to.  Sure.  Okay.  Right.  Because he didn't want to kill a customer.  Right.  Shit nugget.  I'm sorry.  Shit nugget.  So Dilbert is...  Cigar body.  Cigar body is on the phone in a cubicle.  And he says, please listen while I read this threatening script, which I'm sure he's not  supposed to say threatening script.  I have hidden poisonous spiders in your home.  If you pay us now by credit card, I will give you the antidote. 
[02:53:30]  And then he says, okay, fine.  That's the caller saying, okay, fine.  Right.  But if you feel a tickle on your leg, give me a call.  So.  This cartoon fucking sucks.  It just gets you angry.  It's so bad.  These guys are fucking terrible.  It's horrifically bad.  It makes me angry.  It is.  It makes you mad.  Once again, a live studio audience, they're actually reading along.  Nothing. 
[02:54:00]  Not a guffaw.  The Polish beheading up Bigger Laughs when we fucking read a transcript of that.  But, I mean, with all the bad news going on in the papers, there is something to be said  to have some funnies.  You know what I mean?  Wow.  All right.  Yeah.  We have one more which will bring us up to date.  This is today.  Thank God.  This is today.  Yes.  All right.  So, where are we at?  Whoa.  Cigar Body.  I'm sorry.  Cigar Body is still in collections.  Yeah.  And he's listening on the phone now.  This one has his roommate, Jigbert.  Okay.  Jesus.  What? 
[02:54:30]  Apparently, this guy's collecting a bunch of Zs from his readers.  Fucking stinks.  Well, the caller calls and says, my wife hates me and I live between an archery range and  a nest of rabid badgers.  And then Dilbert says, is that a reason for not paying your bills?  And then the guy says, I'm just saying.  You mutt his cunt.  That's not what the guy says.  No, the guy says, I'm just saying you called it a bad time. 
[02:55:00]  Now, before, I know, just saying it, it's not funny, but there is an arrow in his chest.  Three rabid badgers are biting him and a frying pan in his head from his wife.  Oh, my God.  So it's kind of a visual.  He can't even draw a badger, right?  No.  Well, they're rabid.  No.  They look like three fucking, three fat man neck skin tags.  Yeah.  It's not even, this is, he's horrible.  Yeah, this guy sucks.  He's not funny and he's a terrible artist. 
[02:55:30]  I just assumed that if he was in the paper, he had to be good.  So I'm like, oh, this Dilbert guy must be terrific.  Well, I mean, if you guys say shit and thinks it's funny.  This guy makes fucking Beetle Bailey look like Woody Allen's short stories.  Like Woody Allen's moose pit?  Correct.  If everyone thinks they can do better, I mean, yes.  What do you do with that, Jim?  What do you do?  You're mixing a concoction.  It's a fucking beverage.  You drink it.  It's a...  This elixir?  Yes.  What, uh, no, you just, you put it in cold water?  Yeah, you put it in water. 
[02:56:00]  And then you shook it in water.  Just regular water?  Watch them shook it, shook it.  Is it going to dissolve or is it going to be lumpy?  It's supposed to dissolve.  Should it be warm water?  No, cold.  It's a delicious treat.  Is it like a milkshake?  Not quite as good as it looks like it.  Those protein shakes taste pretty good, actually.  Yeah, this is Rocky Road.  Rocky Road.  I've not tried it.  But we learned how to make...  Have you tried the old dirt road?  Oh, yes, I have.  Many times.  Mm, delicious.  You bet I have.  Shaka, shaka, shaka.  He's shaking now.  Yeah.  He looks like a Tom Cruise in Cocktail. 
[02:56:30]  That's right.  He's shaking that around.  Taste it.  I want to hear how awful it is.  I just want to hear how awful it is.  I just want to hear how awful it is.  I just want to hear how awful it is.  And then I'll have this giant vat of the shit at home.  Yeah.  What does it taste like?  It's not great.  Really?  I can smell the goodness over here, though.  You're doing something wrong.  I can't see it dissolving in that kind of water.  It is.  I need a shaker.  The ones I do at home...  You've got to blend it.  You've got to throw a banana in there, maybe.  No, no.  Yeah, I'll get your banana. 
[02:57:00]  Put a little banana in your tailpipe there.  Is it lumping up, though?  It's clumping, right?  A little bit, but it's okay.  Then you're going to have a big dry clump of powder.  You start coughing.  Can I have a towel or something?  Or a fucking paper towel?  Yeah.  Then it breaks away in your mouth.  Put it over it?  Yeah.  It's like...  Excellent.  There you go.  Well, Sam, what do we got now?  Well, would you want me to read the original?  Oh, fuck.  I printed out another comic that maybe everybody could fill in the blank box.  If you want me to read the original, or you guys could just read the first two boxes. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, don't read the original.  Wait, we're playing our own.  That way, yeah.  And the whole audience can play, too.  Oh, I thought he just did this on a regular basis.  That was just one and done?  Where you make up your own ending?  No, we can make up our own ending for a new one.  All right.  Sure.  But there is a real ending, is what you're saying.  Yes, there is a real ending.  So we have to try to do better than the ending.  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  It's the job interview.  Go ahead there.  Right.  Well, the job interview.  So she's there giving him the interview, and she says, I detect the flop sweat of desperation. 
[02:58:00]  And Dilbert is sweating.  And with his stupid tie sticking straight up in the air.  He has a boner.  He doesn't have a tie clip.  No.  And then she says, I base my hiring decisions on who would make a good mate, and I would  never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Well, give me a pen.  Here we go.  Oh, I need a pen.  Here we go.  Oh, my.  And is the audience attempting to fill in the third panel there, Sam?  Yeah.  I mean, we gave them early, so the audience already has some. 
[02:58:30]  Do you want to start with some of those?  Yeah.  As Jimmy and Ant, right away.  Well, Jonas says, after she says, I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby,  Jonas says, here's cab fare to Ted's abortion emporium.  Cut neck.  Cut neck.  I figured that would happen.  Wow.  Wow.  All right. 
[02:59:00]  The audience handed in their third panel, going through.  Same theme.  Jimmy, you got one?  Same reading yours?  Same theme.  Well, this one's worded better, I think.  She says, I wouldn't, and I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  Yeah.  And she says, you wouldn't have to worry.  I'd abort it with my fish coat tie.  See, that's two abortion jokes in a row. 
[02:59:30]  In a row.  Well.  Yeah, that's why that one didn't.  Ah, okay.  Can I have some more blank ones?  All right, go ahead, Sam.  Another one from Jonas.  Yeah.  Jonas, very motivated today.  Yes.  I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And then Dilbert responds, that's why I'm throwing you down the steps, clit nose.  She does have a clit nose.  All right.  This one, from an unnamed listener.  Okay.  I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby. 
[03:00:00]  And then Dilbert says, something smells putrid and it ain't my sweat.  She says, excuse me.  And he says, it smells like your shallow grave, cunt.  All right, here's one.  I got audience participation as Anthony hands his in.  Scott asks from Quakertown, right?  So Dilbert says, okay, I'll just fuck you in the ass then.  That's a good one. 
[03:00:30]  This one from Anthony.  Can you reread the entire part to just get everyone back on the same page?  And then read Anthony's third panel.  The lady interviewing Dilbert says,  I detect the flop sweat of desperation.  And then she says, I base my hiring decisions on who would make a good mate,  and I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And then Dilbert responds, I'd kick you in the cunt anyway  till your spawn splats on the floor like a jar of marachino cherries. 
[03:01:00]  Jesus.  See, because, you know, she insulted him and he told her a thing or two.  About a thing or two.  Yes.  Well, Evan, one of the listeners, says, you know, she says,  and I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And Dilbert responds, that doesn't make very much sense.  So that's Evan's take on the comic.  She could write for this comic. 
[03:01:30]  Yes.  Let's see, another good one.  This one is written in caps, so I'll try that.  That's a good job, right?  It's yelling.  It's yelling.  Will says, I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And Dilbert responds, well, shut your cock, sucker.  You shall feel my balls upon your chin after a prompt bra bombing. 
[03:02:00]  Lingalonga.  There's no reason for that type of language.  No.  That's a little wordy.  Not at all.  Owen was a little wordy, Sam.  Yeah.  Yes.  You got one?  Who's this from?  This is from Jim.  Oh, Jim.  As in Jim Norton.  No.  Jim Norton.  Some listener named Jim, I guess.  Someone named Jim.  You have to read the whole cartoon, of course, because the cartoon's funny.  Yes.  Right.  From the beginning.  She says, I detect the flop sweat of desperation.  Then she says, I base my hiring decisions on who would make a good mate, and I would never  want to give life to your sweaty baby. 
[03:02:30]  And then Dilbert responds, you silly goose, babies only sweat when you fuck them.  Now that's a funny Dilbert.  It sure is.  Oh, my God.  Intern Paul is going for one. 
[03:03:00]  See if Intern Paul can follow Jim.  All right.  She says, I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  Dilbert says, take it, bitch.  Which is simple.  I might have one.  Short and to the point.  Oh.  All right.  So, Interview Lady says, I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And Dilbert says, that's not sweat.  It's lake water.  That's funny. 
[03:03:30]  Bravo.  Shit's hard.  As you guys are writing, I could give you the one that I didn't read.  Which now I'll read.  Yeah.  Now that I've got a little confidence, throw it out there.  I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And Dilbert replies, well, from the looks of you, you'll probably miscarry anyway.  Look, you got a solid response from that one.  Sam, you got another one over there, not worth reading? 
[03:04:00]  Here's one from Scott.  Maybe our intern Scott, or maybe a listener named Scott.  All right.  I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And then Dilbert says, no problem, then let me blow it on your head like a broken beehive.  All right, that's one.  This one is coming from Jim.  A listener named Jim.  Listen.  Who, uh, she says, I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby. 
[03:04:30]  And then Dilbert says, then how about I eat Mexican and fill your pussy full of shit?  I never thought I'd see space docking come to a Dilbert strip.  Jesus.  So, I mean, I don't know. 
[03:05:00]  We're just about done, Sam?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know if these are better than Scott Adams punchlines.  They're alternative.  Yeah.  There's, I guess there's this one written like a serial killer.  She says, I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And then she says, I can tell you are sweating profusely because it looks like Niagara Falls coming out of the front of your pants.  So, I don't know if that makes any sense at all. 
[03:05:30]  But I'd have one there.  Listener Tony.  From New York.  Tony, uh, I'll start from the beginning.  I detect the flap sweat of desperation.  I base my hiring decisions on who would make a good mate.  And I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And then Dilbert responds, good for the baby.  Don't Sloan Kettering.  Didn't Sloan Kettering take your diseased tits?  What the fuck? 
[03:06:00]  Chiss.  Oh my god.  Uncle.  Thank you, Danny.  See, I read this and didn't read the name on top.  Silly me.  Intern David has submitted a copy.  Oh!  For real?  Yes.  If you remember last time we did this, Intern David's was a hit. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  As a matter of fact...  Should we have David read his own?  Yes.  Yes, we should.  All right.  Let's get Intern David in.  Executive Intern David.  Make it quick, David.  David.  Well, Sam, why don't you do the setup and then when it's time you point to David and he'll  read his third panel.  Okay.  Hand this to him.  David, read your part when I point to you, okay?  All right.  Okay.  It starts...  It's great.  Holy shit. 
[03:07:00]  Sorry.  It starts...  I detect the sweat...  I detect the flop sweat of desperation.  I base my hiring decisions on who would make a good mate, and I would never want to give  life to your sweaty baby.  And the woman says, so I guess I can't hire you.  And Delbert says, what?  You can't handle the sweat, bitch.  Oh, wow.  You shut up. 
[03:07:30]  That's not right.  David.  You don't know comedy.  David.  That's why they're here.  Wow.  All right.  So that's David's take on it.  Oh, wow.  David.  He really got into that role, too, didn't he?  Any listeners send out another listeners?  Oh, yes.  This is another listeners.  Oh, listen.  I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And then...  And then Delbert says, I wish old... 
[03:08:00]  I wish old dumpster womb Palin had said that.  What?  I wish old dumpster womb Palin had said that.  Sarah Palin.  I don't think it's going to get better than that, unless that one's worth reading.  It's another one from Jonas. 
[03:08:30]  This whole cartoon has just become...  You write the most horrific things you can think of.  Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  That's pretty funny.  I detect the flop sort of desperation.  I base my decisions on who would make a good mate.  I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And then she says, Mr. Hargis.  Mr. Hargis.  Huh?  All I heard was sweaty babies. 
[03:09:00]  From Daniel.  Mr. Hargis.  You spelled Hargis wrong.  I know.  I can't remember how to spell it.  It's H-A-R-G-H-H-I-S.  This is Swedish.  Are you done?  I'm done.  Yeah, I think so. 
[03:09:30]  All right.  How about this when we come back?  We have a couple more of these.  But how about the best one that's completely clean?  Wow.  That's tough.  No profanity or abortion references.  All right.  Okay.  I'll get some more.  I'll need a new sheet.  Yes.  All right.  We'll try to do that after the break.  Stay there.  On behalf of 8.3 million grateful New Yorkers, it is my honor to welcome you to City Hall  this morning.  Why don't you sit down and relax and enjoy. 
[03:10:00]  Give us Sully and the Crew some keys.  I certainly hope you feel at home here.  Yeah.  And you should.  New York City, as you know, I think is a city full of heroes, whether it's our firefighters  or police officers, emergency workers, everyday citizens on the show that are on Brand of  Courage.  That's a big walk right in his vagina.  That's why I think we have all felt such a strong connection to the story of Flight  1549.  Not just because it happened right on our doorstep.  What about Oceanic 815?  But because these were individuals who managed to save every single passenger on that flight 
[03:10:30]  lived up to an ideal that, to all of us in New York, we all aspire to and that many  of us have reached.  Not all.  Now, the crew has probably relived the events of January 15th many times, but one thing that  you may not be aware of was that while you were preparing to take off at LaGuardia, I  was giving my annual State of the City speech at the same time.  You weren't listening, were you? 
[03:11:00]  Is that a Dillbert fucking cartoon?  Exactly.  Dildo.  And that no matter how bad things may get and how rough a patch we have to endure, New  Yorkers always find a way to pull through together.  Yeah, that's right.  And we certainly showed that on the frigid afternoon, a day that could have been one of  our most tragic, but became one of our most triumphant.  Our first responders coordinated an amazing rescue. 
[03:11:30]  It was an unbelievable job.  They brought pride to our entire city.  And I think they showed the world why they are the best.  But the bottom line is, they could have been facing a far more difficult rescue, if not  for the quick thinking, cool composure, and the extraordinary skill of the flight crew.  The two pilots pulled off a remarkable landing, and then as water poured into the cabin, the  crew came together as a team to quickly evacuate the plane.  Gather back up the headphones. 
[03:12:00]  Exactly.  Fuckers.  But in this case, it is no matter.  Without the years of experience and training, you know, shitting non-pillow givers.  Assholes.  Air passengers everywhere have been reminded.  They decided to put their dicks in the passengers to fuck them even more than they already had.  No pillows or blankets and freezing water.  And I think they demonstrated that they do.  You're right.  You're kind of good.  Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of all New Yorkers, I want to thank you.  Not all.  Thank you for saving so many lives.  Not happy.  Yeah.  Thank you for sparing our city and so many families from an awful tragedy. 
[03:12:30]  And thank you for renewing our faith in the strength of human spirit.  That's right.  You've reminded us.  It's not the airline industry, which apparently can't fucking fly over birds.  We can achieve the impossible.  And for your unforgettable actions, it is now my pleasure to present each of you with a rare honor.  The key to the city of New York.  Everyone's given a fucking key.  Exactly.  We'll do this every other week.  First flight attendant, Doreen Walsh.  What do they do with these keys, Ed? 
[03:13:00]  What did she do?  Nothing.  She fucking, she probably panicked.  A dyke.  Looks like a, she's awful.  Guys, we're going to have plenty of time.  Just relax, okay?  Oh, excuse me.  Ooh, someone.  He's cranky.  It'd be funny if she pushed him out of the way and just said, I want to answer some questions, Mike.  The fact that I look like Linda Tripp should not be an issue.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus Christ.  She looks like that.  Show the key.  That's how he tried to turn the key.  Oh, my God.  She looks like that actress that now looks like that. 
[03:13:30]  Terry Garr.  Yes, thank you.  Yeah, she looks like Terry Garr now.  God damn.  Terry Gargoyle.  What else?  No.  What does she do?  Nothing.  She did a big shit.  Nothing.  She acted as the landing gear with her face.  She made the shitty announcement about how many miles they'll be earning and then quickly  changed it to six.  Yeah.  I think we're going to drink.  She's probably shitting her panties.  She gets a key.  All right.  All right.  How big is the flight crew, Mike?  Move on with it.  Mike, let's go.  Hand one key.  Let them fight over it. 
[03:14:00]  Funny.  She knows she didn't do anything.  Of course she didn't.  She just knows it.  Exactly.  She's like, eh.  She's awful.  She's not even a sexy stew.  No, she's terrible.  We were just along for the ride.  Flight attendant, Sheila Dale.  Let's take a look at Sheila.  Let's hopefully Sheila's got some fucking ability.  Sheila.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's like a tranny.  Let's see.  Hi.  Hi.  I'm Sheila.  Hi, Daddy.  Right.  That's right.  Thank you for flying U.S. Airways.  Please use the emergency exits located on either side of the aircraft. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, boy.  She was counting her neck ripples when the plane went down.  Oh, shit.  What's up with that?  Holy shit.  So it's like Lieutenant Dan.  Some attacker tried to slice her throat 30 times and miss.  That fucking dumb hairdo.  Her nose is shaped like the key that the mayor just gave her.  Yeah.  The same fucking...  Doesn't look a little manly.  I want her to give my asshole a buggering with that nose.  Oh, Steven S. from Bayshore is explaining this.  A fun fact.  Steven does this from time to time.  The key to the city of New York fits the asshole of Ed Koch, so. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, my...  And then...  She's kissing the mayor.  Stop kissing the mayor on his effeminate cheeks.  Flight attendant, Donna Dent.  Oh.  Donna Dent.  Donna Dent.  Like her pussy dented.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Here we go with this one.  She looks like Aunt Peg, the porn star.  She has fucking Liam Neeson's wig from fucking Taken. 
[03:15:30]  She's wearing, like, Charles Nelson Riley's neckwear.  Holy fuck.  I hope that she should use it to hang herself at the hotel later.  She looks like Tim from the British office.  Yeah.  She's awful.  That hair.  Hey, Derek, congratulations.  Where's Derek?  I thought the other two were awful.  Oh, this one takes the cake.  Wow.  She's fine.  She is.  That haircut is awful.  Yikes.  Horrible.  Yeah, what a fucking giant fucking awful thing on her neck. 
[03:16:00]  For somebody who wrapped up a homeless person.  Here you go.  She needs medical hair restoration.  First officer, Jeffrey Skiles.  All right.  All right.  Let's see, Jeffrey.  Boom.  He's just the first officer.  Wow.  He didn't do shit.  No, he didn't.  He doesn't even know how to hold the key.  Yeah, you fucking awkward Jeffrey Jones looking creep.  He's got a porn, 70s porn star mustache.  He should be trading fucking computer files with fucking Pee Wee Herman.  You Ferris Peele.  He just looks like Peele's principal. 
[03:16:30]  Awkward schmuck.  Rudy, land that plane.  Wait till Sullenberger comes out.  Wait till you see the ears of this motherfucker.  I guarantee you that's what fucking helped the plane land.  Hey, Dickie Punchcock writes,  that flight attendant would love to go down on Jennifer Hudson.  Ah.  Oh.  All right.  That creepy stash.  Remember who you're dealing with.  Look at the piece and cute, Buster.  Buster. 
[03:17:00]  Right.  You got enough pictures?  Fuck.  Yeah, exactly.  How many of these?  Put them in the fucking...  This way, this way, no one's ever taken this picture before.  Yeah.  Other than that incident in the park.  Oh, my God.  It looks like Stunberg.  Captain Kuhl himself.  Captain Kuhl.  Cullenberger.  His name is Chelsea, this guy.  Old fruity name.  The girl name.  Yeah, exactly.  There he is.  Nice ears, Cullenberger.  You got a better key?  No. 
[03:17:30]  Look at him.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  This would just throw his key in the Hudson.  Captain Kuhl.  Yeah, what did he just put his ears out the window and glide down?  Of course he did.  Fucking dumbass.  Horrible.  These are.  Were they asking him questions?  Yeah.  Or is he yelling at him?  He's hearing things from, like, two states over.  Hello.  He's out of it with a question.  Wow, they're getting mad.  He's done.  All right, so this is the moment that we've been waiting for.  Have we?  It's the captain, Chesley Sullenberger. 
[03:18:00]  Chesley?  Chesley.  Get his key to the city.  The captain of the aircraft, the USA.  Good old Chesley.  It's like Joe Lieberman.  That went into the Hudson River on January 17th.  Ah, there's the mayor with the long handshake.  Mayor Michael.  They're just holding hands.  Yeah, they're holding hands now, like two fruits.  And the rest of his crew members as well.  And I've kind of been doing some math here.  It looks like they have all racked up, all three flight attendants and the two pilots,  of more than 150 years' experience.  Oh, wow.  Well, yeah, if you add their ages together.  You want a 150-year-old pilot bringing your fucking plane? 
[03:18:30]  Of course not.  With the airlines.  One of the Wright brothers.  Very interesting to find an Airbus A320 on that day.  You want to impress me?  Do it again.  Exactly.  There you go.  With pigeons.  Come on, Sully.  Do it again.  Chesley Sullenberger trying to make his way through a very loud and somewhat boisterous press  there.  Everybody trying to stay on the way.  Because they're vultures.  Nice shot.  So, once again, Mayor Michael Bloomberg handing over the key to the...  New York City.  I don't know if he makes any jokes.  His jokes are the worst.  Oh. 
[03:19:00]  Yes.  Flight.  I'm going to improv now.  He's Captain Cool.  All right, tonight, CNN, Tuesday night.  Captain Cool.  What a dumb thing to fucking call him.  He's going to be on Larry King.  Roll fucking tape.  That's going to be some good shit.  Let's say hi to Josh in Cleveland.  Josh.  The key to the city.  Open every door in the city.  Comment, please.  Josh.  Morning, boys.  Hey, Josh.  Hey, I was wondering if you guys saw this video of Chris Jericho punching some girl in the 
[03:19:30]  face after a WWE event.  I just saw it for the first time.  It's pretty ridiculous.  Well, we got Sam in here.  Maybe we should do a little wrestling update.  Because, you know, Vince McMahon got hurt again.  Yeah.  And you got Chris Jericho punching some fan in the face.  What's that about?  Well, there's a whole bunch of stories going back and forth about, uh, first they said  that this girl's boyfriend, like, lunged at Jericho to, like, hit him, and then Jericho  just started swinging, and this girl lunged at him, so he swung at her, too, and punched 
[03:20:00]  her in the face.  But how did he get in a position that he's punched in the face?  Well, it was after the show, and so they're driving out of the arena.  Oh, this is not fake wrestling shit?  No, no, no, no.  Oh.  Then why the fuck are you telling us this?  I know.  I'm here to, you know.  But, uh, so they're driving out of the arena, and the traffic gets stuck, and, uh, there's  all these fans circling the cars.  So, he gets out of the car to take pictures, because they're not moving anyway, and then  since Jericho's playing the whole heel thing... 
[03:20:30]  Hey, you ready to go home?  Listen, you asked here...  Yeah, I am.  Where's the punch?  Huh?  Who fucking held this stupid camera phone?  You suck.  No, Michael J. Fox.  You ruined your fucking moment.  You totally ruined the fucking moment.  But our pal Chris Jericho, man, he's all over the place today.  If you were able to fucking stand still, put your arm in the air, and just hold the camera  steady...  So, Chris Jericho's a bad guy, he's leaving a wrestling event, they start fucking with him  a little bit, for real?  Yeah.  And then, did someone, a fan, actually charge him? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, that's what they're saying, they charge him and spit on him and stuff.  And now he's kicking on everybody.  Right, because then, one guy swings at him, he swings back, so then all of a sudden, people  are swinging at him, and so he's just trying to clear everyone out, because security's  not doing a good job.  And now they're saying, he punched and spit, allegedly, on him.  Oh, boy.  So, alright.  Well, I could've got a beating.  You think they'll fire Jericho?  Yeah.  Why would they fire him?  They won't fire him.  No.  He's too big, eh?  I could've got my ass kicked.  Yeah, you could've, he would've went.  How's Vince? 
[03:21:30]  Vince is off TV again.  What happened, Sam?  Well, very, very serious concussion, they said.  Very serious concussion.  Didn't he just come back from the last fake injury?  Well, I don't know if it was fake.  It was a Botox injury.  Yeah, well, what's up with all these fake injuries?  Well, I don't know anything about fake injuries, but I do know that he was punted in the head  by Randy Orton, which resulted in a very serious concussion and neck injury.  Very serious.  And how long is he going to be out this time?  Who knows?  Mm-hmm.  They would've fired Randy Orton, but then he came on TV and announced that he had IED, 
[03:22:00]  which is a disorder.  Yeah.  That results in outbursts.  It's improvised.  So, wouldn't Vince, at that point, go, well, you're a loose cannon.  Explosive device.  No, no, no.  It's a disorder.  It's not a device.  IED? No?  But wouldn't they just let him go, because that could be a problem?  No, because the problem is he also, the night before, won the Royal Rumble.  Right.  Which guarantees him a shot at the world title at WrestleMania.  Just give it to somebody else and get the...  No, because he won the Rumble. 
[03:22:30]  The guy out of the company before he gets him in trouble.  But he signed the contract that says he gets the main event, the Royal Rumble.  Mm-hmm.  Now, at the pay-per-view, Shane O'Meck is going to get his revenge.  Why is Shane O'Meck fighting?  Because he's avenging...  He's the son of a billionaire.  What is he doing, Sam?  Because the millionaire...  He doesn't even do this anymore.  The millionaire got kicked in the head by Randy Orton.  The billionaire.  The billionaire.  Right.  And so now the billionaire's son is there to avenge him.  I'm taking a vacation.  Get your ass in there and fight, Shane.  It's not a vacation. 
[03:23:00]  But, Dad, I'm getting kind of old.  Right.  Uh, I have a lot of money, family.  Right.  The McMahon's always fine.  Look at me.  I'm getting kicked in the head.  You're going to get in that ring.  He probably has Shane's kids taking bumps already.  Getting ready for the next generation of McMahon wrestlers.  I'm announcing the first ever baby cage match between my grandchildren. 
[03:23:30]  Stephanie just had her second kid.  Get it in the ring.  Yeah.  An umbilical cord snipping match.  He's in the hospital.  I don't think now...  I doubt he's in the hospital.  Well, maybe not anymore, but he is definitely bedridden.  Yeah, is he?  Is he?  Well, otherwise he'd be on TV, I'm sure.  I want to thank Sam for really slowing down the show.  Hey, I...  It was a hell of a show until this point.  We had some funny Dilbert cartoons to read.  Oh, my God.  You were part of the really good bit with intern David, but... 
[03:24:00]  There's more Dilberts.  No, that's all right.  More Dilberts?  We had some clean ones.  Yeah, we got clean Dilberts.  What was your clean one?  I didn't have any clean ones.  Oh, you didn't?  Is there a good clean one?  Well, if by good you mean...  Bad?  One of the Ron and Fez interns submitted a clean one.  Yeah, what was it?  His name is Vince.  He's a new Ron and Fez intern.  Oh.  All right.  And so the comic goes, I detect the flop sweat of desperation.  I base my hiring decisions on who would make a good mate, and I would never want to give 
[03:24:30]  life to your sweaty baby.  And then Vince has Ron saying...  I mean, Vince has Dilbert saying, I work hard for money, and I have A.C. in my bed.  Cool.  Wow.  So that's...  That guy really represented Ron today as well today.  Here's a clean one.  Okay.  Ron is not going to be happy.  That's a clean one.  Get that.  Yeah.  Okay, this is from Tony, who says...  She says, I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby. 
[03:25:00]  And he says, but it's not sweat, it's psoriasis.  See?  It's ironic.  Right.  It turns it around because it's like, she wouldn't want to give birth to a sweaty baby, but he's  like, it's not sweat, it's psoriasis, and she really doesn't want that either.  Yeah.  And here's another...  Here's another clean one from a listener named Jim. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  There it is.  I love it.  She says, I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And Dilbert responds, could you repeat that?  I was fantasizing about raping you with a stick.  Now, that isn't a clean one.  Sure it is.  That doesn't follow the format.  Yes, this is clean.  Jim actually...  Listener Jim has another clean one.  Oh, okay.  She says, I would never want to give life to your sweaty baby.  And then Dilbert responds, I'm not sweating.  My eyes are making cumzies. 
[03:26:00]  All right.  That one was clean.  It is possible to do clean.  All right.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Let's.  Language.  Yeah.  All right.  Well.  Good start to the week.  Yes.  I want to thank everybody.  Tomorrow's Tuesday already?  Wow.  We showed up for a Monday show.  You guys are crazy.  Yeah.  Look at this.  Big crowd, though.  And they seem to enjoy it.  That's good.  Thank you.  And that's it.  No big outs.  Let's just get the fuck out of here.  See you tomorrow.  Let's start our day.  See you tomorrow. 
[03:26:30]  Bye. </pre>
