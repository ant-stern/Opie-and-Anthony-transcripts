<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts jokingly contrasting their perceived lack of success with their surprisingly popular radio show, hoping to capitalize on Howard Stern's absence.  They then transitioned to the final space shuttle landing, sparking a humorous, crude discussion about "docking," followed by reflections on the end of the space program and moon landing conspiracy theories (referenced in the context of a Mythbusters episode).  The anniversary of JFK Jr.'s death led to a conversation about his plane crash and the excessive grief surrounding Princess Diana's death, with jokes about the sincerity of condolence book signers.  The 24th anniversary of Guns N' Roses' *Appetite for Destruction* prompted a debate about their first hit and the lasting impact of GNR and Nirvana on the music industry, contrasting past radio influence with today's diverse music consumption.  They concluded this segment with a negative review of a past interview with Paris Hilton, comparing her unfavorably to Kim Kardashian, and a discussion about Maynard James Keenan's Tool performances, including a caller's claim of Keenan having "tits" on stage, along with a brief Michael Jordan dunk anecdote.

The show continued with further discussion of an underwhelming Michael Jordan dunk video and an announcement of a future live broadcast from the New York City Hard Rock Cafe, with details on RSVPing via Facebook, including a comedic "Gatorade. Is it in you?" bit and a brief Louis C.K. voice message.  The extreme heat in Washington D.C. was discussed, along with the accuracy of heat index measurements.  The arrival of Patrice O'Neal in studio was announced with dramatic flair.  A substantial portion focused on Patrice O'Neal's contract negotiations with another radio show, detailing frustrating low offers and comparing them to podcasting opportunities, with specific financial figures discussed.

The show then shifted to Tiger Woods firing his caddy, Steve Williams, prompting speculation about the reasons, including Tiger's lack of self-awareness and Elin Nordegren's potential influence.  This led to a broader conversation on relationships, infidelity among friends, and maintaining friendships after breakups, including personal anecdotes from the hosts and callers about dealing with ex-wives and the complexities of post-breakup friendships.

Further discussion of the hosts' past relationships dominated the next segment. Opie discussed a picture of his ex and Anthony's ex seemingly friendly, suggesting shared resentment towards them.  Opie then ranted against the "partnership" aspect of modern relationships, preferring autonomy. A caller, Dennis from Babylon, recounted meeting both Opie's and Anthony's ex-wives, leading to further discussion about the hosts' past relationships and the drama involved. Opie detailed his resentment towards his ex-wife, calling her "Long Island white trash," describing his pre-emptive attempts to avoid arguments, his reasons for marrying (to appear grown up),  her bossiness and anger, the financial difficulties of the divorce including nine years of alimony, and that he faked orgasms during sex to avoid having children with her. Anthony revealed he paid Opie back for a cruise Opie's ex took Anthony's ex on, despite prior on-air conflict.  The segment concluded with Patrice O'Neal plugging his stand-up shows, an anecdote about a helpful experience at a gay supermarket, and commentary on interactions with Black women in customer service roles, including stories of Opie's assertive mother and generally unfriendly experiences with service workers, touching on race and class dynamics.

The final segment focused on stereotypes and behaviors of different racial and ethnic groups, frequently using offensive language and making generalizations. The hosts discussed their perceptions of how various racial and ethnic groups (White, Black, Asian, and Eastern European) might react to robberies and their interactions with law enforcement. Stereotypes about security guards (particularly large Black women) and police officers were discussed, focusing on physical attributes and perceived attitudes.  A caller, Al, shared a negative experience with Black female security guards in jail.  The hosts speculated on the types of people hired for security, police, and meter maid jobs, connecting lack of respect to job placement. A video of a violent altercation between a Black man and a female police officer was also discussed.  The hosts commented on the physical fitness and demeanor of police officers, particularly women, and how this might affect their ability to handle confrontations, along with anecdotes about police interactions, "disorderly conduct," and the perception of police as enforcers versus servants of the law. The prevalence of unmarked police vehicles was also discussed.  Patrice O'Neal contributed to the conversation with his perspectives, and the show ended with Patrice plugging his upcoming comedy shows.

[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most  listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton? 
[00:04:00]  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  Hi.  Thank you, Larry King.  Thank you, Larry King.  Why do these guys pull us in?  This guy needs a question answered right away.  Oh.  Uh, JJ.  JJ.  JJ.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hello.  I'm confused.  Is it Thursday or Friday?  And is the limo there?  It's Thursday.  Thursday.  Thursday. 
[00:04:30]  Thursday.  Why?  Oh, Howard's limo?  Yeah.  Howard did his three days, man.  What are you, crazy?  He's done for a while now.  That's it.  And the only reason why we bring this up, we're hoping some of the Howard listeners,  they might want to enjoy some live programming, so we're here for them.  Pop over.  Pop over.  Say hi.  So I think he's off until next Monday, and then I think he completes his six days for July,  and then I think he'll do maybe seven in August.  So keep us in mind when you're thinking about what to listen to. 
[00:05:00]  That's...  Live programming on the Opie and Anthony show.  God, I wish.  Huh?  It's a dream come true, right?  Oh, God.  I'd be in bed right now, just kind of like, this is great.  It's Thursday.  I'm snoozing.  Snoozing.  You know, we had a great three days, too.  Yeah.  So we'd be just enjoying our lives.  Oh, yeah.  We'd come back eventually to do another three days.  Oh, please.  It truly is a dream come true, man.  Dream come true.  So the space shuttle just landed for the last time. 
[00:05:30]  That was sad.  It was sad, right?  I've always been a space guy.  I've loved NASA and the space program ever since I was a little kid.  I remember during the Apollo program, some gas station was given away, with every fill-up  if you go to the car, you're giving away this cardboard lunar module.  And it was sheets of cardboard that were perforated, and you would tear out the little pieces and fold them on the lines, insert tab A and slot B. 
[00:06:00]  And before you knew it, you had this cardboard lunar module.  The only reason I'm laughing through the telling of that story.  It's like, where did I start crying?  And when did your dad say, stop playing with dolls?  No, that was a...  Because somehow he would probably spin and say, that's a doll.  Maybe that's why I like the space program so much, because my interest in it wasn't something my father could interpret as being gay. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  Because it was a manly venture.  I don't know that.  It's a big rocket, if you know what I mean.  Oh, you mean like the lunar module itself going into the base?  Uh-huh.  Like docking?  Oh, there was some docking going on during the space program.  You didn't have the actual rocket part?  Well, I didn't think in like 1967, 68, and 69.  I don't think docking meant what it means today.  I really don't know what docking is, Anthony. 
[00:07:00]  Well, docking is when two men, usually gay.  It figures that Danny's over there today, and of course, there's the docking photo.  And there's docking pictures.  Lickety split.  There's some docking, Opie.  It's when a man puts his penis in another man's foreskin.  That looks just terrific.  Come on, guys.  We don't know what docking is by now?  Of course.  We all know and love docking.  I did a goddamn talk show with Sam about it. 
[00:07:30]  Yes.  Adventures in docking.  Adventures in docking.  Why don't we make a documentary on docking?  Dock-umentary.  A dock-umentary on docking.  Spell it with dock, D-O-C-K.  I like that.  So we could get in theaters.  So we could get in theaters.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  It'll get in theaters.  Yes.  It's opening Friday wide.  It'll play right alongside Harry Potter.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Well, what's this guy peering at two men docking?  Did gay guys just get bored?  Yeah, I think they did. 
[00:08:00]  I think we could do this now.  They got bored.  Yeah.  They got bored.  But I don't think dear old dad was thinking about docking or anything like that.  And he was fine with filling up at the local Sinclair station.  Yes.  Where I could also get my green dinosaur.  Sinclair.  The fuck year was it?  See, we're different, though, because I enjoyed when we went to the moon and stuff.  Yeah.  This space shuttle stuff, they didn't go high enough for me to hold my interest. 
[00:08:30]  No, not high enough orbit?  Nah.  Nah, he didn't like that.  And we don't really get to see the space station.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So I never really had a big-time interest in the space shuttle.  Yeah.  The first few, you're thinking, wow, the potential of this.  Okay, they're going high, but you know they're going to go higher and they're going to come  up with new stuff and blah, blah, blah.  And they never really did.  It was never meant for a really high orbit.  I do understand that.  Or going out of the Earth's orbit.  But it was always meant for, you know, relatively low orbit. 
[00:09:00]  The space station's there.  They brought a lot of stuff to the space station.  Put up a lot of satellites early on.  Did some military satellite programs.  And fixed the Hubble telescope.  They were involved in that.  They just did a lot of things.  It was a very utilitarian thing.  And there were experiments going on.  But, yeah, on the heels of the Apollo program, it did look like a big letdown. 
[00:09:30]  But the thing that really gets me is, that's it.  We now have no ability to put American men or women in space.  Aside from hitching ride with the Rooshkis on their stupid Soyuz rockets.  Which they've been using forever.  What's the plan, though?  There's no plan right now, right?  Future plans for NASA?  No real.  Is it just going to kind of just sit there for a while?  There's ideas. 
[00:10:00]  They want, you know, NASA itself and a lot of the proponents of the space program want to start working on some kind of Mars mission.  Which would start with, you know, low Earth orbit space stations and construction of some vehicles in space.  So you won't have to get that big launch off of Earth.  Putting stuff on the way to Mars and on Mars before people get there. 
[00:10:30]  So this would be years in the making.  But with the economy the way it is now, you know, we're pretty much fucked as the space program goes.  We're going to lose a lot of ground.  NASA is going to lose a fuckload of jobs, by the way.  The economy down there by the Space Center is going to take a shit because the program's gone.  And, I don't know, it seems to me that that was one of the most innovative things besides war that we had that gave us so many things we take for granted today that we have technology-wise came from the space program. 
[00:11:00]  Space program and war give us the best shit.  People just walking around.  And, bah, what do you think, George Washington Carver and his peanut?  It's really helping us out.  Maybe a woman and her dog every so often.  But as far as the space program goes, I'm pretty sad to see the shuttle program wrap up. 
[00:11:30]  It's a sad day.  Yeah, I just watched it.  And on the heels of it being the anniversary of the Apollo 11 program and Neil and Buzz being on the moon.  If you believe in that.  Taking off.  If you believe in that.  You want Troy Kwan in here?  Oh, if he, on this day, when I just watched the shuttle land for the last time, if he starts his shit about the moon landing didn't happen and he's got questions, well, I got fucking answers, okay? 
[00:12:00]  I, it happened.  We went to the moon.  There's a bunch of people out there that don't believe that.  Oh, crap.  They just don't believe it, Ann.  Go crap on you.  They just.  I shit on you.  Don't believe it.  Yeah, it's retarded.  I didn't think.  You're a retard if you think.  I didn't think we'd see this in our lifetime, that we would be shutting down our space program.  I know.  It's, you know, they're going to be using various rockets to launch satellites with. 
[00:12:30]  Um, and maybe, um, maybe re-equip some of the stuff on the, uh, the space station, uh, unmanned with rockets.  But, uh, as far as getting human beings into space, we have to hitch rides with, uh, with the Russians.  Mythbusters did the walking on the moon?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Was it a good episode?  Yeah.  It was actually a fantastic episode.  It was very informative.  They, you know, they, they replicated, uh, all of the, the myths that surround, uh, the, the conspiracies. 
[00:13:00]  And, and, uh, even the, the, the really tough ones, like with shadows and lights and stuff.  I mean, they, they did it.  And there it is.  I mean, it's really hard to dispute.  Cause a big thing is, uh, you know, the results, uh, meaning they could have faked it.  No, no, no.  Meaning that, uh, you know, everything that NASA said about the moon landing is true.  Like when they say, you know, the, the shadows look a certain way because of perspective and lights and stuff.  I mean, that's, that's a lot of fuel for conspiracy theorists to go, oh, you see, they just making excuses.  But then when they replicated, uh, and they, they tried to use everything, like everything was to scale. 
[00:13:30]  Even the, the moon dust itself, they tried to get the right reflective properties.  They tried to get the right, uh, the, the fineness of it.  Yeah.  And they, they put together a mixture of faux, phony moon, uh, uh, dirt and sand.  That was pretty comparable to the real thing.  And the reflective properties and why certain parts of the, the, uh, lunar module are lit when they shouldn't have been.  Exactly.  That was the exact thing that I remember where I think there was a picture of, I think Neil Armstrong, uh, on the ladder. 
[00:14:00]  On the ladder.  And, uh, the way that the picture should have gone is that he is in a shadow.  So he should be completely, uh, uh, dark and in the shadow, but he's kind of lit up looking.  So the conspiracy theorists say, oh, it was a lighting fuck up.  They fucked up shooting that scene.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The reality was that it was simply just light reflecting off of that moon dust off of the  dust.  Yeah.  And it would light him up.  And sure enough, when they redid it, they constructed a set and they, they show this episode to a 
[00:14:30]  conspiracy nut.  And then what do they do?  They, they, they, they, or do they ignore this?  And they always say, oh, you're going to believe that?  Like they don't have any real answers to the answers.  And, and if you don't think the moon's a reflective property, look at it at night.  Why the fuck do you think we see it?  That's the sun reflecting off the moon when you see it at night.  That's why it lights up because the sun is hitting the moon and it's so reflective. 
[00:15:00]  It's so fucking bright.  That's why sailors go blind staring at the moon because they're really just staring at the  sun.  Right.  Yeah.  It's reflective properties.  Shadows that turn.  They say, look at this shadow.  It, uh, it's not lined up with this other shadow.  They took pictures of instances on earth with street signs and curbs and the shadows and a  mailbox where it doesn't line up property because of the terrain. 
[00:15:30]  There might be a hill and it, it, uh, it, it distorts the shape of the shadow to even argue  this point is retarded.  The amount of people that were involved with, with this, uh, uh, space program during the Apollo  programs, it's unbelievable.  You could not possibly, uh, get that many people to shut their, shut their yaps.  Yeah.  They're showing shadows. 
[00:16:00]  That was the instance where they said, oh, you see how the NASA photos, there's two different  light sources because the shadows fall different ways.  So when the, when the myth busters tried to replicate that shot, they, they were stuck because  their shadows were going one way.  They couldn't figure out how to get two shadows to go different directions with one light source  until they started playing with terrain and said, oh, well hills and, and, and the way  that the, the, the terrain affects, like you were just saying that the light, you know,  then they did it.  And sure enough, you look at a shadow, if there's a certain hill, it's going to bend, uh, the, 
[00:16:30]  the, the whole thing with, uh, why are there no stars in the sky?  There's no stars.  Well, how come there's no stars, uh, in the daytime here?  Cause it's fucking bright.  The moon's bright when the sun's hitting it and it's reflecting off of the surface and  the shit, it's, it's fucking bright.  Well, why are you arguing the point to yourself?  Just believe what you believe and let's move on.  That's exactly it.  We landed on the fucking moon.  We landed on the moon.  It was amazing.  And we don't have any space shuttles anymore.  And Buzz Aldrin punched the guy in the face for saying no. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Old crazy codger.  Or yeah, no more shuttle program.  I guess they're going to take the shuttles and, uh, put them in various museums.  Yeah.  Are you saying even Buzz Aldrin has haters?  Oh yeah.  Even Buzz has haters.  Here's a guy that knows for sure.  He was on the moon and he has to deal with idiots.  He's going to deal with idiots.  He just has to deal with jerks.  Why don't you admit that you, it's like, dude, I risked my, I risked my fucking life.  I was on the moon.  I walked around, looked at earth and went, ah, that's so far away. 
[00:17:30]  Why does he get a bad reputation?  Because he punched a guy.  Wouldn't you?  If you walked on the moon, you're on the, he walked on the moon, right?  Oh yeah.  Second down the ladder.  Yeah.  Uh, if you walked on the moon and then people are arguing for the rest of your life that  you didn't do it.  Of course you would be punching people.  Yeah.  Of course you would.  He's smacking people every day.  He should be.  I don't think you were on the wham.  Wham.  Right in the face, you fucking hump.  All right.  Well, that's it.  It is a sad day because, uh, we've had the space shuttle our entire lives. 
[00:18:00]  I remember as a kid back there in the, uh, early eighties, very excited.  Even though I think the, the late seventies, early eighties, when they first would test  out, uh, the enterprise, uh, the shuttle where they would have it a piggybacked on the  seven 47 and then, uh, they would break off from the seven 47 and glide it down.  It was like, wow, that is fucking cool.  That was cool shit.  I just felt like they didn't move forward too much with this whole thing.  Yeah, it was, it was really meant as just a cargo transport vehicle for the space station. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  I understand.  Uh, for various satellites, but, um, I was just hoping we would go back to the moon or  do something cool.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And if, and if that was the next plan, if they were stopping the shuttle program to move on  to something else, definite, like when they stopped the, the Apollo program, uh, they  already had like the shuttle program in the works.  They're like, all right, we're, we're transferring from this to this.  Now we really don't have anything that we're, we're transferring to. 
[00:19:00]  Uh, it's just, well, uh, we hope to try to get some funding to maybe do this.  Uh, they, they're going to do a lot of stuff with a lot of, um, automated, uh, robotics.  What about the private sector?  Well, that's another thing they're going to work on is, um, but I mean, that's so far off  and, you know, Virgin Atlantic is that guy, what's that lunatic, a crazy fucking, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  That lunatic, you know, but it is going to be pretty much a ride. 
[00:19:30]  You want to go into space?  Give me a couple of hundred grand.  Here you go.  Look out the window.  And now we land.  Ooh, wow.  There's some exploration for you.  Anthony, uh, one question coming in.  Yes.  Fair enough.  If Neil was the first on the moon, uh, 40 years ago, 40 years and one day ago, then  who was holding the camera if he was first on the moon?  Oh, please.  They had swing out boom cameras on the lunar module.  So when they landed, this boom with a cam would swing out and, uh, be focused on the ladder. 
[00:20:00]  And that is the view you saw.  Actually, Joe, the photographer was first to be on.  Yeah.  He was the first guy on the reality show.  Yeah.  Neil Armstrong is going to be the first astronaut, but we got to capture this.  So we're going to have Joe, the photographer, go down the ladder and set up for the shot.  Exactly.  It's like when the shrink goes to the hoarder's house, knocks on the door and walks in and  there's always already a camera in the house.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, wait, what was that? 
[00:20:30]  He was the first guy in the hoarder's house.  What's that?  What's that?  So I would love to know where that guy is because he was the first on the moon.  He was the first on the moon.  The guy with the camera.  Yeah.  I can't be bothered.  Oh, these motherfuckers.  Hey, other things going on.  Dings.  Dings.  Dings.  There's another anniversary today.  Well, what is that?  Well, and it brings back horrible memories because I had an ex that cried at the weirdest shit. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, shit.  If a princess was dying, she's fucking losing her mind.  Or if someone from Camelot died, she was losing her mind.  Oh, my bad.  Is this a broad thing or was this just my ex?  I didn't see many guys weeping.  I'll give you that.  Well, when Princess Di died, it ruined a terrific vacation we were on because, you know, I guess she felt close to Princess Di.  Yeah.  And then 12 years ago today, JFK Jr. was lost. 
[00:21:30]  That was...  With his wife and what, sister-in-law, was it?  Yeah, they were flying up there, of course, to their fucking Massachusetts retreat.  Or was it...  The vineyard.  Oh, it wasn't.  I think they were going...  Well, they weren't going to the Hyannis Pot.  Were they going to Hyannis Pot?  Hyannis Pot.  I forget now.  It's been too long.  But that's 12 years ago already.  Yeah, he fancied himself quite the pilot.  And they loaded his chicks in there.  And he had a busted leg at the time. 
[00:22:00]  He had a cast on his leg.  So people were saying, well, maybe...  How do you work the brake pedal?  The brake...  Where are the brakes?  The rudder.  Maybe a little trouble with that.  But he said he was okay there.  You know, there was no problem flying with a busted gam.  But it was a very hazy, hazy day.  And when you're flying over the ocean, or the Long Island Sound, you know, and the water,  you really didn't have a good visual reference on a horizon.  It was cloudy, too, right? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, it was a little cloudy.  It was more hazy where you couldn't really distinguish the ground from the sky.  And also it was dark.  And that's a problem.  They went at night, right?  It started getting dark.  It was dusk.  I'm not sure if it's instrument rating, but whatever.  He really wasn't paying much attention to it because he got spatial disorientation.  Oh, boy.  Where your plane could be tilted at a weird attitude, and you'll feel like you're upright. 
[00:23:00]  And without a visual reference of a horizon, you will just fly your plane right into the  fucking ocean or the ground unless you pay attention to your instruments and say, wow,  my instruments are telling me I'm at a fucking 45-degree bank, and I'm pitched down 15 degrees.  Maybe I should fix myself.  It's a rookie mistake.  You've got to trust your instruments, right?  Very, very rookie mistake.  Yes.  Oh, they were going to the vineyard.  Thanks, Brad. 
[00:23:30]  He wasn't rated to fly in no horizon conditions.  That's what I'm getting over here.  Yeah.  So there's a problem right there, thinking he could just buzz across the sound, not knowing.  The best part of that whole thing was they sent the Navy and everyone to find the body.  Oh, my God.  And I know it's a hack pit, but it's unbelievable if you really just sit back and think about it.  So they spent all that money to find him just to throw him back in there. 
[00:24:00]  And they throw him back.  What's the difference?  You know he's gone.  You had to find him.  He's a candidate for the love of God.  And then they put him back in.  And then they wrapped him up and tossed him back.  I don't understand that.  Let's see, motherfucker.  I don't understand that.  Yeah.  But it was 12 years ago today that my ex lost her fucking mind.  Damn, yo.  Does anyone else have broads like this in their lives or in their past lives?  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  You remember the princess die thing. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, Christ almighty.  We were hanging a little bit more those days.  Your broad even got my broad fucking going on that one.  And she was heartless.  Jesus.  What did we do during that period?  Drank.  Didn't go home.  We were just drinking and hanging out together.  Didn't go home, drank.  I think they bought all the books and everything.  I was like, why are you buying books?  You don't know her?  How is she an inspiration to you?  Didn't your chick go to some church somewhere and sign the book that we goofed on? 
[00:25:00]  Probably.  There were a bunch of places all over the world, these holy places, churches, mosques, temples,  everywhere, where they had these books that you would sign and be like, Lady Di, you meant  so much to me and stuff.  And all we pictured were all these books being shipped to England and the royal family just  going, yes, burn them.  You think the Queen Moon at the time is going to be like, oh, let's read this one. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  Oh, yes.  This is from Sandra.  She's in New York.  Let's.  Oh, she.  Oh, she loved us so much.  Okay.  Bring me book number one million two, please.  I'm going to thumb through this.  You know, they just were burning the books.  Oh, they didn't give a shit.  The Queen Moom's Tootsie's warm.  Queen Moom.  Moom.  Well, they just dumped it in the hole with her body.  They didn't do shit with those books.  I bet you they never even collected them.  Probably never.  Sitting in warehouses all over the United States.  Guaranteed. 
[00:26:00]  I'd love to know where those books are.  I'm like, how is she an inspiration to you?  She was a princess.  You're from center reach.  Yeah.  Let's calm down a little bit here.  Princess.  Fucking an Arab.  And I understand.  Married to the royals.  I understand to a point being bummed when some iconic figure dies.  I do get it.  Because we feel a connection in a way, I guess.  Yeah.  But taking it to that point where now you're signing books and crying nonstop for weeks.  She would not stop her tears, would she? 
[00:26:30]  I remember I was bummed when Lennon died, but I was also very young.  Everyone was at that point.  You know?  If you were around then and, you know, you weren't two years old, yeah, you were kind of bummed  out at that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's 12 years ago today.  We lost someone from Camelot.  Camelot.  That thing.  In pure Kennedy fashion.  Right.  Much too young.  Much too soon.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  That cursed family. 
[00:27:00]  It's a weird family.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Appetite for destruction.  24 years ago today was released.  24 years.  Yeah.  That's a...  Are you shitting me?  That's like...  I can't even fucking fathom this.  I...  I...  I...  I don't...  What happened?  I don't know.  What happened?  I don't know.  I remember rocking out to that and...  It didn't seem like 24...  24 years ago today. 
[00:27:30]  God damn.  I was living with the boys in Rochester.  House full of men.  And then our appetite for destruction came in.  And I remember just rocking that album.  Over and over and over and over again.  Was that 86?  86.  Yeah.  86.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I was working at the home of rock and roll at the time.  God damn.  The first of many home of rock and rolls that I would work at. 
[00:28:00]  I think that was my first year as a Timknocker.  Really?  Yeah.  What's your favorite song off this album?  First year.  It has to be Welcome to Jungle.  It's gotta be.  Sweet Child.  I know it's overplayed, but when you hear that song, to this day, you just gotta turn  it up.  Because this was like the...  This was the big fucking, like, first hit off of this album.  And...  No, no.  Sweet Child was first, wasn't it?  Was it?  I'm gonna challenge you on that, Ant.  I think Sweet Child was first.  Are you kidding?  And then Welcome was, uh, the second. 
[00:28:30]  Am I right, Danny, or no?  Second single.  Yeah.  Sweet Child of Mine was the third single.  Get the fuck out of here.  No, Paradise was the number one.  Hang on.  I'm reading as I'm doing this.  Uh, Welcome to the Jungle was the band's second single.  What?  Are you serious?  What the fuck was the first single?  Wow.  Oh, here we go.  It's So Easy was that first.  Nah.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  It's So Easy was released June 1587.  Okay.  Well, regardless.  Then it was Welcome to the Jungle in October.  What did it hit, though?  What did It's So Easy hit on the charts?  Because I'm sure Welcome to the Jungle hit a much bigger...  Wait, wait, wait.  You're talking to a guy that was doing radio at the time.  It's So Easy, I would bet a lot of money most rock stations might have...  They might have played it, but it didn't do much.  It was the first release.  It was Welcome to the Jungle that fucking put Guns N' Roses over the top.  I'm telling you right now. 
[00:29:30]  That's what I remember.  I'm telling you right now.  I thought it was Sweet Child, but there's no way It's So Easy was the one that put him  over the top.  Yeah.  No fucking way.  Yeah, Jungle was the first real fucking hit off of that.  Yeah.  And when I heard that one, in the midst of a lot of hair bands and shit, this was the  shit.  This was the shit.  I think there were two moments that I remembered.  Guns N' Roses changing music and then Nirvana changing music. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  In our little lifetime, I guess.  Yeah, because it wasn't a gradual thing where it was like, oh, look, this just morphed  into that.  Remember this thing?  It was like you heard it one day on the radio and went, all right.  Like, that's completely different than what I've been listening to.  I don't think we've had a lot of those moments, right?  I don't think we've had one since Nirvana.  I'll tell you, I had one.  It's not as impacting as Nirvana or Guns N' Roses, but the first few times I heard System  of a Down, I was like, what the fuck is this? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, System of a Down is a weird fucking sound.  And for a while, I hated it because I was like, this sounds too crazy to me, but then  I got into it and I liked it.  That's fair enough for you, but I'm wondering mainstream if we've had one since Nirvana.  Yeah, as an individual.  You know what I mean?  Individually, we could all go, oh, when I first heard Radiohead or whatever.  What in the band can you say that about as far as rock music goes?  It's like, that's all I got to go on.  It's not a personal thing.  It's just like, that's what rock music gives you, so that's all I have to go on.  No, I understand.  I'm not questioning it.  I'm just saying, from a mainstream point, I'm wondering, because like Ant said, I mean, 
[00:31:00]  as we're talking about Guns N' Roses, everyone out there, a lot of people out there going,  the fuck yeah, when we heard this for the first time, we knew music was going to be  different.  Right.  And then when Nirvana hit for a lot of people, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  I'm talking about the masses, not individually.  Because I remember when I first heard Radiohead, I'm like, what the fuck?  But I don't know how mainstream that changed music like Guns N' Roses and Nirvana did.  Yeah.  And have we had one of those since? 
[00:31:30]  Not that big.  Not to that extent.  You could say things like, yeah, like Radiohead and even Korn and things like that kind of  got us out of that grunge thing.  Right, right, right.  But nothing to that impact.  I wonder why.  Because everything sucks.  Everybody sucks.  I think because as music went on, it was starting to be played, you know, in so many  different places. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  When Guns N' Roses hit, you had your rock station.  That was it, man.  Obviously, we didn't have phones or.  You know what?  You're right.  We didn't have an online presence, none of that.  So when these things hit, everyone was paying attention at the same time.  Yeah.  You know, you don't have that anymore.  No.  Absolutely fucking right.  It's tougher.  Now you have so many different avenues to get your music that it doesn't really, everyone  was listening to their rock station at the time.  So when the DJ broke Guns N' Roses, everyone heard it the same fucking day. 
[00:32:30]  And not only the DJ, rock radio in general were basically saying, okay, I mean, they would  say this in closed door meetings.  All right.  Next Tuesday.  Yeah.  Guns N' Roses.  Guns N' Roses.  It was across America.  They really did control like what, what genre of music was going to be the next big  thing.  Now you, you, you can't, you, you listen to whatever the fuck you want, whenever the fuck  you want.  I hate to say this, but the kids today, they have no idea how lucky they are because I 
[00:33:00]  remember I was in the business.  I was, I did a lot of rock radio and I always wondered, and you saw some of this at AF when  we were transitioning into talk, Dave Douglas was controlling what kids were listening to.  Yeah.  And I used to find that incredibly odd.  Thank God Ozone really was, but.  Well, Ozone, thank God was there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But in a lot of radio stations, it was the Dave Douglas guy who, if you don't know, was  so fucking nerdy. 
[00:33:30]  Out of the loop.  He had a wife that didn't even understand the genre and why he was working in that type  of radio.  Yep.  She was probably, I think, pretty religious and all that, which influenced Dave Douglas.  And you had these programmers that would sit down in meetings and decide what songs were  cool for 15 year olds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's what you got, motherfuckers.  And that's what you got.  So I'm wondering how many bands fell by the wayside because some dopey nerd didn't understand 
[00:34:00]  their music.  Didn't like their music.  Didn't understand it.  And what personal problems with it.  And when I say the kids are lucky today, you don't have to deal with that shit.  You're out there exploring and discovering music on your own because it's a lot easier.  Back then we couldn't.  No.  There was no internet.  No.  Maybe you got a cassette from somebody every once in a while and went, wow, there's some cool  shit on here.  If there's a band that isn't being played on the radio, it doesn't mean it's not popular.  It doesn't mean it's not being listened to by millions of people anymore. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  You needed radio play back in what I like to call the day.  You needed radio play.  You needed it all the way up to late 90s.  Yeah.  Right?  Now, fuck radio.  You don't need it anymore at all.  No, I don't give a fuck.  There's plenty of places to go.  If you're listening to a, if you stumble across a band you like, now you fucking download the  entire album.  Right.  Turn your friends on to it.  You know, whatever.  It's just, it's a whole different way of getting music.  But I remember Dave would just sit, maybe talk to other programmers. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  And look at the, he had to look at the, uh, the trade magazines and then, and then, and  then add songs.  And I'm like, he needed help.  How about you, how about you play the, these songs for the 15, 16, 17 year olds that are  listening to the station to see if they like it.  Not you.  Oh, did he need help?  Thank God there were people there.  A lot of people saying White Stripes, Disturbed, these, these bands.  Yeah.  I was going to bring up Disturbed, but that, that is more of a personal.  Slipknot.  Disturbed didn't change. 
[00:35:30]  I don't think we've had one.  A type of music.  I don't think we've had one since Nirvana.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With that mass, holy shit moment.  And, and I think it's because of what you said.  Like everyone, that's what you had to do.  You had to, you were there.  Right.  Hey, five o'clock, we're releasing the new blah, blah.  Blah, blah.  Right.  And five o'clock would come around and everyone's listening and going, all right, that sucks  or that's great or wow, holy shit, that changes music.  Now you just don't have that.  Everybody's all over the place. 
[00:36:00]  If you're listening to radio to find the next big thing.  Oh God.  You're already fucking 20 steps behind everybody.  I feel bad for you.  Yeah.  I really do.  So there you go.  24 years ago today.  Huh?  I'm willing to say you're a fruit.  Fruit.  Oh, you didn't tell me.  What's your favorite song off, um, did you say welcome to the jungle?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's gotta be.  I thought the video was cool.  It was fucking, you know, it was a great song.  And I think it defined, uh, Guns N' Roses. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  I think that was crazy shit right there.  I think I would have to go with you.  And I'm not saying that the rest of the album isn't great.  You know, we've talked about this album just recently, but, uh, I'm not saying the rest  of the album isn't great, but that one song was like that defined Guns N' Roses.  And it's very rare to find an album where every song is good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pick a bad song off that.  Danny, pick a bad song off Guns N' Roses.  If you had to.  Off of Appetite. 
[00:37:00]  Hang on.  Let me pull up the track list.  If you had to, what, what would you say is their weakest song?  And most people know this album, like the back of their fucking hand.  I had to stop listening to it, really, because.  Well, I understand.  It was just too much, man.  Once it gets played, it's played, you know.  It was too much.  So, let me try.  I'm going to try to pick a bad song, too.  Welcome to the Jungle, then it goes It's So Easy, Night Train, fucking rules.  Night Train.  Out to Get Me, Mr. Brownstone, Paradise City, My Michelle, Think About You, Sweet Child, 
[00:37:30]  You're Crazy, Anything Goes, Rocket Queen.  The only two songs I don't know that well.  Out to Get Me.  Out to Get Me and Anything Goes.  And Anything Goes.  Those are the two songs I don't know that well.  Yeah.  So, I would maybe pick one of those.  Maybe.  Yeah.  But there's 12 fucking tracks on this thing, man.  I might go My Michelle.  I mean, it's still.  You don't like My Michelle?  It's still an okay song, but, I mean, as far as, like, the melody goes, it's, like, whatever.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Everything else is going to get stuck in my head first, to put it that way. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You know Out to Get Me?  I used to know this entire album, Inside and Out.  It's just, it never left.  Like, it was always in every car that I had.  But it was always in, like, my CD player or cassette deck or whatever.  And it got to the point where I just had to put it down.  Like, just put it the fuck away, or else you're never going to be able to enjoy this ever again.  Here's Out to Get Me.  I think this is rockin' fucking good. 
[00:38:30]  I know this.  Metallica changing after Nirvana?  Give me people that moment?  Nah.  Almost.  Also, Limp Bizkit.  Oh, God.  Stupid Limp Bizkit.  Metallica had its place, but I don't think they're, I don't think when you heard Metallica, you went like, this is changing a genre of music.  I think they were part of the genre. 
[00:39:00]  That Blackout was fucking huge.  But, I mean, really early on.  As far as radio goes.  That Blackout was huge, man.  I mean, it was impossible for them to really get real airplay with seven and eight minute songs.  I know.  Yeah.  Well, then, that made a lot of people that weren't into Metallica go backwards and go, fuck, these guys have been cool forever.  I know, yeah.  Why didn't I know about them?  But there are other bands that have, like, smaller, smaller parts that they played in the music business like that, that didn't give you that giant moment, but were like, wow, this is fucking, like, Tool, I think. 
[00:39:30]  I think Tool was fucking another band that kind of was like, wow, this is fucking cool, and it's different than what's going on, I think.  You know?  I love Tool to this day.  Every time I think of Tool, I just think of that video with that claymation thing pushing the shit through the pipe.  It was the creepiest fucking video, man.  The video for Sober and Prison Sex were fucking so insane.  Yeah, Sober was just a great song and a great fucking video. 
[00:40:00]  Maynard, man.  Just creepy as fuck, man.  That claymation old guy pushing shit through a tube.  And then other people try to copy, like, Tool's look and videos.  And just get all weird and creepy.  They did that with Nirvana, with that blurriness.  Yeah, that's fucking great.  Remember how Nirvana would make videos, and it would be, like, soft focus around the edge and then the middle. 
[00:40:30]  And they'd go from, like, a depth of field from a blurry background to blurry foreground, blurry background again.  And then I started noticing that in, like, tampon commercials.  And you're like, that's over.  That's over.  That looks over.  Just stop already now.  Look, they're just showing pipes.  It was a creepy place.  And whoa.  You know what kind of is?  Yes.  Yes.  It didn't ruin Tool for me, but, like, it kind of, it was a little surreal.  I went to see them.  Actually, Oak gave me the tickets.  They're really good cities.  And the drummer, like, you expect them to all kind of have that Tool vibe and look like Tool, and they're all crazy and wacky. 
[00:41:00]  And he was wearing, like, a full-on Knicks outfit.  Like, it was, like, the jersey, the shorts, and he just looked like a regular dude who really loved basketball.  And I was like, wow, that's not what I expected.  When I saw him, he wasn't front and center as the, as the.  Well, I'm talking about the drummer, not Maynard.  No, I know, but Maynard wasn't front and center, which I thought was so fucking weird.  He did his vocals, I'm trying to remember, it's been a while, but all the way to the back and to the right. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, that was weird.  And it was so uncomfortable for me.  That's weird.  Because, you know, you're used to the band looking like it is.  The front man comes out and controls the whole thing.  He was uncomfortably in the background the entire show.  Exactly.  Exactly.  When I saw him, same thing.  And obviously, that was calculated.  He went for that.  What the fuck is that about?  I don't know.  And he was in the shadows and he wasn't, he wasn't lit at all.  Did you see, because I think they put that screen and there's always weird shit going on on the screen. 
[00:42:00]  And that's more of a show than, than anything Maynard's.  I liked it because it made me uncomfortable and it was different.  Yeah.  Trust me.  But I got to point out how weird and different it was.  Yeah.  There were, there were some bands, some bands that made you just go like, wow, that's really not.  Really good.  That was a really good show.  Like this fucking video, I'm watching it right now, is, is so creepy.  This old guy's just looking in his box on a table and it's, his head's all cracked.  It's like they used clay that was too dry. 
[00:42:30]  He's walking around all hunched over.  Some stop motion was still the shit.  Oh yeah.  Like Mortal Kombat graphics was the best anything was going to be.  Yeah, shit.  It, it, it, none of it makes sense.  What's he doing?  Oh, it makes sense to me.  His shaky hand as he's laying down all fucking.  Wow.  This was the, one of the weirdest fucking scariest videos. 
[00:43:00]  His chair lifts up off the ground.  Yeah.  I like Tool.  I love Tool.  Back in the day.  I'm going to listen to some Tool today.  Now I have to do Day and T.  The.  Owls and Chains.  I mean, there's a lot of bands that definitely changed it for individuals.  That was part of the whole grunge thing.  You know?  A lot of people have, you know, dude, before Nirvana, there was this, that, that, and that  was what grunge was and that. 
[00:43:30]  I understand.  But as far as breaking it out for the general public, you know, Nirvana is pretty much what  everyone remembers as being the, at the forefront of grunge.  Yes.  Also, it was, uh, 24 years ago today.  This is for the old times.  Robert Pepper taught his band to play.  Exactly.  Remember that Mary Hart?  She was on E.T.  Yes.  Remember her legs were so fucking good, they insured them for $2 million?  Oh, sure they did. 
[00:44:00]  Do you remember that one?  I think that's, um...  Urban legend?  I think that's, like, urban legend bullshit.  I was going to say, now it's 24 years later, those legs aren't worth shit.  Oh, God.  The insurance value gone way down on that one.  The premiums, really low.  Deductible.  Varicose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's some varicose shit happening.  Yes.  Mary Hart.  And then, uh, Paris Hilton.  What about this cunt? 
[00:44:30]  We had this broad on.  Yeah.  And, um...  Man, she's showing everyone.  Now, what she's made of.  Uh, yeah.  Extremely shallow.  She's definitely not, um, coming off well.  For somebody that's trying to plug her show, that's bombing.  Look, she was very lucky to be an A-lister.  Extremely lucky to be in that, uh, that whole world.  Because the fact is, we saw it for ourselves, this broad has nothing to offer.  Not a goddamn thing.  And it was, it was proven with this reality show of hers, which was just there. 
[00:45:00]  She has no entertainment value.  Um, she can't speak.  She just can't communicate.  And then when she gets frustrated, she looks to the side and, and, and looks for a publicist  to help her out.  Uh, that's what she did on our show.  When, when we got into some questioning, which wasn't, we weren't trying to beat her up.  Ann was asking some good questions.  That's a good bunch of questions.  And she turned all the way to the right, all mad. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  And looking at her publicist, like, your job is to save me.  Yeah.  How about you save yourself and talk your way out of this stuff?  No, if you're a talent, you're a scary fucking talent.  Well, she did the same thing for the guys on GMA, I think.  Yeah.  And the, the video's all over the place.  We got the audio of it, but this is how it went down.  Uh, Paris Hilton having another kind of tizzy and walking off a show.  Do you worry at times that the people who have followed in your footsteps, uh, like  Kim Kardashian, are overshadowing you? 
[00:46:00]  No, not at all.  There's been some talk about the ratings in the show being low.  Um, has that upset you?  No.  Never a feeling of, do you ever worry about, do you ever worry about your moment having  passed?  You want to wrap up?  Can I, when I was curious about one thing, we have to.  What followed was a long, heated conversation with Hilton and her publicist.  Ugh!  We had...  The publicist. 
[00:46:30]  Of course.  You know, uh, what?  What?  I was supposed to put the kid gloves on?  Right, what's the problem?  What a fucking piece of shit.  Uh, just go away, Paris Hilton.  What you don't see, uh, obviously on the radio, is, uh, after he asked, the interviewer  asked that question, she just kinda stares blankly, and then he says,  and glares over at the publicist.  All the way to her left.  And so that's why, that's why she's not saying anything, because she's just staring at the  publicist, like, hey, you're gonna, what are you gonna do?  Help me, help me, publicist. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, what's the problem?  You never had substance.  Yes.  Whatsoever.  Stop it.  And your time is up.  Kim Kardashian took your fucking thunder.  And, uh, Paris Hilton introduced the world to, uh, Kim Kardashian.  And Kim Kardashian is the same type of broad.  She has nothing to offer.  Nothing to offer.  She's really hot.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  She's beautiful.  But past that, Kim Kardashian has nothing to offer the world of entertainment.  Nothing.  That's her walking off?  Yeah.  See, that's the question.  She looks over at the publicist. 
[00:47:30]  You wanna wrap up?  But I, when I was curious about one thing, when I asked.  And then she walks off.  But her PR convinced her to make good.  I've been in this business for 15 years now, so it's been a very long time.  And just like any other business person or someone in the industry, it's always important  to reinvent yourself.  Smart move, Paris.  What have you done?  Wow, you see the look in her eyes, though?  Smart move, Paris.  She's fucking pissed.  Because her whole life, she's been just coddled by her parents and everyone around her. 
[00:48:00]  Because she'd dress in her panties and bra, go out to clubs where paparazzi was everywhere,  drink, snort coke, do whatever the fuck she wanted to do.  And that was like, holy shit, look at this wild bitch.  And now, what is she, reinventing herself into what?  She thinks she's a businesswoman?  She's not a businesswoman.  I've run 17 businesses, do you really?  Do you?  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  You're a figurehead for a lot of businesses. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, you're a face.  And you've probably got some good business people behind you.  And if she's not going to be that whorey fucking sex tape, you know, partying girl,  no one wants to see her, because that's what she did.  That's why you're famous.  That's why you're famous in the first place.  And when the guy said, do you think that's passed you by, he's saying it because you're not seeing you on the cover of all these rag magazines anymore with your fucking cunt hanging out, coming out of a limo.  Like you said, famous for being a partier and having a sex tape. 
[00:49:00]  That's it.  So don't get pissed when someone calls you out on it.  And she had a really good reality show because of Nicole Richie.  Yeah.  I love The Simple Life.  I really did for the time.  Which, by the way, she said that the Paris that you saw in The Simple Life, the airhead, bubbly baby voice, girl, that's just a character.  That's a character, like Mr. Amos does.  And then when the cameras are off, that's the real Paris.  Well, then she should go back to being the character, because what we got was a dud. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, please.  A really boring fucking person.  Could you bring the character back, please, because I don't like this.  That seems to have no original thoughts in her head.  No.  Nothing.  She's a zilch.  She was protected by a lot of fucking people.  She's a zilch, and we were vindicated because she's a zilch on every fucking show she goes on.  And then she blew off Sirius XM because of us?  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, yeah.  We did nothing that day.  No, of course not.  And she's proving it, obviously.  And this shows.  Yeah.  If anybody were to give us any shit about what we did, and, oh, she left, and we missed an interview, 
[00:50:00]  look at what she's been doing since.  Horrid interviews.  She walks out because a guy's asking her questions that aren't milk toasty.  Mm-hmm.  Fuck you.  God, I can't stand her.  I'm going to play the rest of the clip I have over here.  We played the, you know, because this is a little different.  And her publicist.  Well, I don't want all this being used.  After which, she agreed to speak with me again.  I've been in this business for 15.  Then we get that. 
[00:50:30]  I don't want this being used.  Well, tough shit.  Then figure out what you want to say.  Right.  Before you get on there.  Right.  Have an answer, dummy.  Be combative.  Do something.  Don't just walk off.  No.  Lucas in Chicago.  Lucas.  Lucas.  Luke.  Morning, boys.  Luke.  Hey, man.  I believe I've read somewhere that a lot of Maynard's, why he plays in the back.  And even when I saw him at a perfect circle, he played even on a pedestal. 
[00:51:00]  He's kind of got this small man syndrome thing where he's conscious about his height and just  his overall size.  So he kind of hides himself away from that light.  I think it's deeper than that.  Really?  Is he a short guy?  Short singer?  Yeah, he's pretty short.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Maybe that pedestal is taking care of that.  Because I would assume he's a tall guy.  Yeah.  When I saw him at, I saw him at, when he was playing for a perfect circle, and he came 
[00:51:30]  out and he was as far back as he could be to the left of the drummer and on this probably  three to four foot platform.  Yeah.  This is the oddest thing.  Maybe it was on the left side.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It was so not where the singers usually go.  It was wild.  All right, man.  Thank you, sir.  Punching out, boys.  Let's go to Preston in West Virginia.  Another Tool fan.  Oh, Preston.  What's up, Preston?  Hello, Preston.  How are you doing?  Yes.  My name's Preston.  I'm Preston.  I'm Preston. 
[00:52:00]  No, I got to see Tool back in the outskirts of the anima tour.  Probably the best one.  He was out in the front the whole time.  Have y'all ever seen Maynard with tits?  Maynard with tits?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Oh, he strips down.  Well, before he got in the back, like he got pissed off at these bands.  They booed like Tomahawk when they played.  So he started turning his back to the crowd and shit.  But I got to see him.  He was dressed like a preacher.  And then by the end of the show, he was in full fucking tits. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, look that picture up, dude.  He was in full fucking tits.  Yeah, you got to just look it up.  Tell somebody to pop it up on the Apple TV, Maynard with fucking tits.  Maynard with fucking tits?  Or can we just put tits in?  Either way would work, I do believe.  It comes right up.  It comes right up, sir.  Danny found it right away.  Maynard with tits.  And it's...  Yeah, we can't find this.  There's no Maynard in sight.  Yeah.  All right, we'll look for that, sir.  Oh, yeah.  Look for that.  I'm just...  Is that one? 
[00:53:00]  Let me see.  And Kevin from Connecticut, who's...  He's got a bra on.  And some kind of a body thing with fucking kabuki makeup on.  All right, well...  What are you going to do?  Yeah, he dressed like a preacher at the show.  All right, we heard you.  Yeah, we heard you.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Calm down.  Oh, fuck it.  This is us comps, sir.  I know.  I'm just fucking with you.  You don't want to see us on 10.  You just don't want to see that.  I don't want that.  I don't need that kind of shit in my life right now.  You know what happens when a race car goes into the red?  What?  Yeah, exactly.  What happens?  Exactly.  What happens? 
[00:53:30]  I need to know.  All right.  I don't know.  Look it up.  Vince never had to go any further than that.  Good thing that he is.  Ah, talking in movies again.  Yes.  All right, Preston.  Always talking in movies.  Thank you.  Hey, good time.  Good time, guys.  Love you, folks.  Good time.  Good time.  All right, Preston.  All right there, Preston.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Yeah, he's good.  He says Maynard is 4'3".  That would be a problem.  4'3".  That would be a problem.  That's crazy.  A drummer from Tool wears a basketball jersey at every show. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, yeah?  Oh, he does.  So that turns you out of it a little bit.  That is his tool.  When you got Maynard doing all that artsy weird shit, and then your drummer's just in,  like, I don't know, a Pistons jersey.  Just wearing some shit from, yeah.  Right.  Kind of.  Eh.  It's just not what you expect from Tool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You expect, like, some guys to, like, be dressed like the fucking Hellraiser Cenobites or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Something like.  And I just.  It's not a fucking Knicks jersey.  He went to Moe's and picked up a fucking jersey. 
[00:54:30]  Speaking of basketball, I'm a big Jordan fan, and a video almost went viral because he was  at some kind of fantasy basketball thing, clinic, camp, something.  What happened?  Uh-oh.  And a guy goes, hey, Michael, can you still dunk?  And I'm thinking, this video's going to be fucking good.  And Michael just takes the ball, dribbles 10, 15 feet, and dunks the ball.  Yeah.  So nonchalant, like.  Just.  The most boring dunk you'll ever see. 
[00:55:00]  He didn't 360 it.  And they're trying to make something of it because he's 48 years old.  But he's also, like, 7 foot 9.  Height helps.  Height helps.  Height definitely helps.  What is he?  Honestly, he's, like, 6'6", I think.  So that's only, you know, three and a half feet.  Yeah.  With the reach and everything else.  Of course he can still dunk.  Right.  He's got his long, gangly arm.  He'll be able to do that at 58, I bet.  Yeah?  Yes.  Come down.  His leg snaps.  Fucking drives his femur up into his hip. 
[00:55:30]  So unimpressive.  A few people tweeted this to me, and I was excited.  I was thinking maybe he would go, not only can I dunk, watch what I could still do, and  maybe do a 360 or something.  Nonchalant.  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  Is that it?  Let's see.  Fantasy camp.  Yeah.  Let's see this.  I just want to show you this.  Michael Jordan dunk.  I was kind of...  Oh, he dribbles it once.  That's it.  And see, no one is losing their minds. 
[00:56:00]  Like a woo.  And did he limp away?  Well, that's his gait.  He did that when he was playing.  Yeah?  Although maybe he pulled his Achilles.  Wow, that kind of looked like a limpy limp.  Maybe he said, maybe, yeah, he pulled something.  Dude, I know what you're talking about, the Michael Jordan walk away, but watch this.  Ah, he went off shit.  Yeah, he kind of was like, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, that's sad to see.  Come on.  You don't want to see that.  No, let's break.  Yeah.  We have Patrice coming in today?  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Well, that's enough talking for us, then.  That's right.  We're done.  No, we love when Patrice comes in.  Absolutely.  We're going to talk about Britney Spears when we get back.  Wow.  There's an ex-bodyguard that had no desire to have sex with her.  Ex-bodyguard?  Didn't she all have all-black bodyguards?  This guy is Fernando.  Fernando.  He's seeking $10 million for sexual harassment?  A sex harassment suit against Spears? 
[00:57:00]  Oh, God.  Conservators?  All right.  This guy just wants a payday.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  Come on.  I'm not going to sit here and stick up for Britney Spears, but, geez, when a guy is suing  her for sexual harassment, you're just in it for a payday.  Well, he's saying some things.  He's saying things?  We'll give you the list of things he's saying next.  Yeah.  And then you decide if it's true or not.  Yeah, I want to eat first.  Believe me.  Also, really fast, next Thursday, a week from...  Are we at Thursday already?  Yes, we are.  This week's flying by. 
[00:57:30]  Next Thursday, we're going to broadcast live from 8 to 10 at the Hard Rock Cafe here in  New York City.  We're taking it out of the studio.  We're going out hitting the streets, motherfucker.  Yes.  Yeah.  Details on how to RSVP.  They want us to RSVP, and Jimmy's losing his mind.  He was so pissed in the halls the other day.  He's like, this is not how you do things, but...  I just go along with whatever they have, because it's easier that way.  Details on how to RSVP for the event are available on our Facebook page, facebook.com slash Opie 
[00:58:00]  and Anthony.  So if you want to join us at the Hard Rock Cafe next Thursday for a couple hours, I'm  sure we'll do something afterwards, because that's a quick two hours.  Yeah.  Go to our Facebook page and figure out, you know, how to get involved with this thing.  I like the old days where we said, hey, we're going to be here, and then we kind of created  a bit of a frenzy.  Yeah.  And it was cool.  And then, you know, the people that didn't get in, they ended up, like, getting together  and doing their own thing.  Yeah, and then they'd go to a bar or something.  It just became a whole thing. 
[00:58:30]  Just fucking let people come in.  But now everything has to be controlled.  Oh, we need reservations, and we're going to have people sign up.  So that's how they're doing this.  Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  All the details are there, okay?  Right.  All right.  Ready?  On action.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  That's great.  Wait.  No.  Gatorade.  I got to hear it.  Is it in you? 
[00:59:00]  Right.  Ready?  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Ready?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  No.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Is it?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Nope.  Last one.  One more time.  Try the last one you just said.  Just conversational.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  All right.  Ready?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Gatorade. 
[00:59:30]  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Okay.  Ready?  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  No.  Don't like that.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Okay.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  It is.  You did a couple great ones.  I love the really sports book.  Now all the way live from New York City.  Buzz Aldrin, everyone.  Well, I got a chance here.  Let me clear.  Let me clear my door. 
[01:00:00]  Let me see those hands again.  Here you are.  Everybody jump.  Buzz Aldrin.  Buzz Aldrin.  Buzz Aldrin.  Buzz.  Buzz.  Buzz Aldrin.  An American hero.  But I got a chance here.  Let me clear my door.  Hello.  This is Louis C.K.  And you are right now listening to Opie and Anthony.  I don't know you, but I fucking, I hate you right now. 
[01:00:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Come out.  Patrice O'Neal is looking for parking, I guess.  What do we got?  A fire downstairs?  Something?  Some kind of activity?  No, I think that's still some kind of a fire department truck.  And it might have something to do with what Fox News is going to be doing.  What is Fox News doing today?  They always got something wacky going outside of their studios.  Maybe they're trying to cool everyone off with the fire hoses. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, that would be good.  I could send them to a few choice areas.  That's why I said it.  I figured I'd set you up a little bit.  It's going to be hot.  Hot, hot.  Now, I know it's going to be hot in New York.  Talking almost 100 today, right?  And then hitting, could be creeping up on 100 in some areas, yeah.  Yeah, but there's rumors that Washington, D.C., I heard 116 degrees.  That's crazy.  Anyone in the D.C. area could back this up. 
[01:01:30]  I'd appreciate it.  That's otherworldly hot.  116 degrees.  Is that possible?  In a place like Washington, D.C.?  I don't know.  Well, I know sometimes things get a little hot on the floor when they're debating.  That's fucking hate them all.  Yeah.  That's my stance.  It's fucking hot.  I'm just going to go fucking to my pool, motherfucker. 
[01:02:00]  My brother decided today was the perfect day to go play golf.  Oh, that's good.  You better have a cart.  Nah.  You're going to walk the course in this heat?  Yeah, I walk a bit.  No, we get a cart, but then I'm like, hey, let me grab a couple clubs and I'll meet you  up at the green.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll meet you up at the green there.  So, I don't know.  I don't know if today's the day to play golf.  Quint.  Yeah.  We'll give it a shot, though.  There was something. 
[01:02:30]  What the fuck was the one thing?  Good luck to you.  The one thing.  Oh, we got the D.C. guys?  All right.  Get the fuck out of here.  Listen to this.  Josh in D.C.  Go ahead, Josh.  What's up, guys?  Yeah, it hit 114 yesterday.  I have a picture from one of those car thermometers.  It hit 114.  Well, car thermometers aren't the most accurate thing.  The heat index was actually 117.  It was, honest to goodness truth, I got my car and it only said 101. 
[01:03:00]  I hate heat index.  I hate wind chill factors.  I want to know the fucking temperature, like a thermometer.  We're getting a lot of heat index guys calling in.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of heat index guys.  The heat index is going to be up to about 120.  That's just a made-up thing so it looks worse than it is that the media invented.  The news.  I just want to know what the fucking temperature is.  That's it.  It's like, you know what?  I'll figure out the other shit on my own.  Get in the heat index.  Let them know how hot it'll feel.  It's like, wait a minute.  But it's fucking 110 out.  Right. 
[01:03:30]  It's going to feel, oh, 110.  What is the heat index?  Oh, you got it.  It's a formula between the temperature and the humidity.  Any wind.  It's a whole thing.  It's just as shitty as a wind chill factor.  Just tell us that it's that heat or that cold.  It's neither.  Whatever.  It did, but officially it did hit 114, at least in Northern Virginia, not necessarily  right in the airport or BWI, but in Northern Virginia, which is still part of the D.C.  metro area, it did hit 114. 
[01:04:00]  What are you doing to keep cool today?  The CBS station here in D.C., the CBS TV station.  Why do you have to have an entrance?  Patrice O'Neill is the only one that has to have an entrance to do a radio show.  Patrice comes in, he points, and he points, he gives the old salute sometimes, a hat tip.  He's flexing.  Why?  He does a little boxing move and then puts his finger out like, yeah, you motherfucker. 
[01:04:30]  Patrice O'Neill.  All right.  Well, Josh, thank you.  We got the great Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  A great one to follow, and we're going to say goodbye to you.  What happened, man?  Parking is a bitch down there?  No, they closed the street down to do something.  Oh, for Fox, like Ava said.  Was it for Fox?  They got some fired stuff there.  I guess they were.  It's firing, and then they're hanging up a huge, you know, American pride thing, so.  What is that about, though? 
[01:05:00]  I have no clue.  They just tell you, go around.  Are they commemorating something?  Did they have the cameras out when we pulled up this morning?  I don't know.  We're right across from Fox.  It doesn't look like commemoration.  It looks like something going on.  I don't know, but I think they're hanging a giant flag, so.  Yeah?  It's something American going on.  Yeah, okay.  Something American going on.  Something American.  Shouldn't they have done that 4th of July?  Well, no.  It's July, what is it?  21st.  What is American going on?  They're probably going to do something really bad somewhere, and then they just got to make sure. 
[01:05:30]  They're getting ready?  We love America.  They're just gearing up.  They're just gearing up to do something horrible.  They got to have big flags on every street just to let us know.  You could be in the countries we're bombing.  Yeah.  Bombing will start.  They're requesting that I film you and your entrance.  Fuck.  Next time.  Oh, well.  Because it is a whole thing that happens.  Well, I come in and say hi.  Yeah.  No, other guys come in and say hi.  It's like a hi thing.  Other guys come in and get coffee.  I like your positive attitude. 
[01:06:00]  I like that.  Some guys come in like, all right, fuck, where do I sit?  Well, we always have to pretend we're doing, you look.  God's work?  No, we have to pretend everybody's doing everybody a favor.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not really doing you guys a favor.  So I'm just like, hey, I'm on radio.  Hey.  There's a guy right now just in his house praying to get on the radio.  There's a lot of guys on the phone right now.  Oh, they love it.  I like being on the radio.  Yeah, it's fun.  I like having public opinion.  Yeah.  You know, we didn't talk about this because it happened off air, but after Patrice O'Neal's 
[01:06:30]  last appearance, one of the guys came marching down the hall and said, hey, you ever  think about doing radio?  After all these years of saying Patrice would be perfect for this channel.  Have you had discussion since then?  We did.  You did?  Yeah.  He's supposed to be getting back to me this week.  Oh.  Did he give him an order?  Uh, yes.  Oh.  Wow.  Did you hear the gulping on the other end of the phone?  No.  I just, I really enjoy, you know, I love talking, but I really enjoy hearing guys talk that know 
[01:07:00]  how to stick it right in your twat.  Like, just, like, nice guy.  I never talked to him either.  All these years.  This is the first time we ever had a conversation.  Just on a basic level.  I actually like him.  He, I know I beat up a lot of guys around here.  I do like him.  We had a nice conversation, and you can hear, you can hear that it ain't, you know.  It's not happening.  You can hear it.  I want it to happen, but you can hear this. 
[01:07:30]  Well, we can all learn from Patrice.  Patrice has his, you know, he's got his number, and he's got what he will and won't do.  And what he, and well he should.  And he will walk.  And I appreciate, I do appreciate.  He doesn't need this that bad.  So he's got, all right, if you give me this and I do this, then fine.  Because they're going to try and negotiate that down.  Right.  I'm not a good negotiator on any level.  I just go, there's things you, the only advice I can give people out there that get played, different things you do. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  You can't, thank you, sir.  You can't negotiate supermarket prices.  Whatever.  Whatever, so that's one thing, you just can't talk it down.  We're not in India.  When you get in a car, if you're financing a car loan, go with the monthly payments.  Yeah.  Just say, this is what I know I can pay monthly.  Don't try to get involved with how you're getting messed around.  Don't get involved with, just say, this is what I can pay.  Right.  And when you go into, after that's the salesperson, then when you go into the finance person, you go, I cannot go higher than this. 
[01:08:30]  So, please don't sell me a Viper alarm.  Please don't sell me a LoJack.  Just, this is it.  That's what you do.  And when you're buying a house, it's the loan.  Don't go buy monthly payments.  Go buy the loan.  That's not going to get you in five years.  With that said, what was his reaction?  We didn't, we didn't agree to disagree, though. 
[01:09:00]  See, see, I told him, I said, look, here's, I'll give you some, some details or small details.  Yes.  Saturday is, is, is needed.  Probably Saturday nights.  You want to do Saturday nights.  Oh, okay.  Well, I wouldn't mind, but that's your time to do your other thing, right?  That's the problem.  Okay.  So, so once we establish without establishing that Saturday, I, I'm giving up my life.  Right. 
[01:09:30]  You got shit to do.  So then that, then Saturday's probably out.  But on the, on the weekday is when we was, we were talking.  I come back usually Monday.  I would have to adjust.  So a once a week show, they need a commitment for a once a week show and I'm cool, but I  still, how does everyone else get this one a day, two a day, three a day?  Well, they're not trying to, they're trying to, they're trying to, uh, ease me in.  So there's, you know, I, I'm a one a day guy to start out with. 
[01:10:00]  If they wanted to have me a five a day guy.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You'd be a good Monday guy, but see Monday, just because a lot of shit happens on the  weekends that you would be able to comment about.  That's, that makes a lot of sense.  Sports, you know, then I would, then I would have to tell, I would have to tell my people  to now only book me.  Yeah.  I can, I have to come back Sunday.  Yeah.  Right.  All the time.  Yep.  So I got to fix that and make sure.  There's a value there.  If, if they want you to come back a little early, I hope they can work it out. 
[01:10:30]  You've been on the short list for fucking, well, you know, but I guess the audience doesn't  know.  Patrice has been on the short list for years.  I'm certainly interested, you know.  I'm just, I, you know, but it was a nice, I like having corporate conversations because  he is, he, he's the man.  Yeah.  We threw in a couple of personal things, you know, you have some good personal life.  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  Then he took out a small one.  Remember those small wooden baseball bats when you was a kid?  Yeah.  Just took a, you can feel a couple of ones just, you know, grab you and then you clock,  you hit it.  You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, probably right 
[01:11:00]  on the elbow or something.  Somewhere where it hurts.  Yeah.  Something you just, you go.  A little tap to the elbow.  Hit that funny bone.  Yeah.  Make your arm tingle.  But it wasn't disgusting.  But it's Thursday and he hasn't got back to me.  So I'm, I'm thinking, um, I'm not thinking, I'm not, I'm thinking.  But they want to appreciate, I was appreciate, it was, I was appreciated.  My honest opinion.  I enjoyed it.  They want, uh, to get talent really, really cheap.  That's, that's their, that's their thing here.  And it's going to blow up in their faces eventually. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause people just have other options, but in, in the arrogance, cause the money they would  probably, let me, sorry, the money I would assume they're going to offer you.  And I don't know.  I don't know what's going on behind the scenes on this one.  You could easily do that on your own with a podcast easily.  Yeah, that's true.  Easily.  That's true.  And that's what these guys got to understand.  We're losing guys to podcasts.  That's stupid.  Less than this. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, wait, let me write it down.  Less than this per week.  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on now.  Wait, that's what they said?  That's it.  It was.  Wait, who was this your number?  That was.  No, this was your number.  If I remember.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't even write it down.  Don't write it down yet.  Oh.  It was, it was because God bless the investigative reporting that when I used to do the Black  Phillips show, that's, that's what I got. 
[01:12:30]  What?  But, and that might be an issue.  Yes.  Nice.  So.  Damn.  But that's.  But that was one time or twice.  Right.  Right.  And that was by the.  But you want this.  Benevolence.  For.  Oh.  At least.  At least.  On a one day.  Stop.  At least.  On a one day basis.  Yes.  I would say.  Well.  I would say this.  That's.  What?  That's what I. 
[01:13:00]  That's Paul Parker.  I would.  Right.  But I know that that's unrealistic.  Wait.  It isn't.  You're saying this?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I guarantee.  Not.  And I will bet money on this, that it's more like this right now.  I guarantee it.  I don't know.  I will guarantee it.  Dude.  Fucking hit the bell.  Hit the bell.  Am I right?  That damn bell.  Dude.  I can't say it's a bell, but.  I'm close though, right? 
[01:13:30]  Yes, you are.  All right.  I have to be.  But what you're doing is life.  That's real.  That's real.  That's what.  They're not going to get you for that.  That's what we're saying.  What's wrong with this?  So you're right.  Oh my God.  But it was.  This was what was that.  What the fuck?  And when that happened last time you hear, I'm like, this is not going to.  How do they do that with a straight face?  Those motherfuckers.  How do they do it with a straight face?  Because you know why?  Someone is saying yes every time. 
[01:14:00]  Who says no?  People got kids.  No, people are starting to say no and they're going elsewhere.  So.  Holy shit.  But I.  But I.  Look it.  You know, it was.  It was.  You know, I can't be.  I can't be upset about it.  I didn't think it was going to.  Because like I said, I said, man, just give me enough to.  Give me enough to.  To stay home.  Make it.  Straight for like.  Yeah.  For six months.  Right.  To make this thing an actual thing that people will go. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, I got to.  Yeah.  Depend on me.  Right.  Build it up.  This.  Right.  Like.  That.  That.  It keeps me here.  Yeah.  And that's cheap.  That is cheap.  To me.  Well, we'll work you in when Jimmy's out in L.A.  Don't you worry.  Nothing's going to change.  Thank you.  It's like.  That's why I go home.  Don't go home with hope.  The sign is right on the door, sir.  No.  Don't go home with hope.  Hope.  Hope is our enemy.  Hope is our enemy. 
[01:15:00]  And when.  I just say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anthony went like this.  When he poked his.  When he poked his head in.  And said.  Hey, man.  You interested.  Anthony went.  He just put his bag on his bag.  And just walked out the door.  It's.  Just get me.  It's mind boggling.  Say it again.  Just get me.  Their strategy.  I'll say it again.  Was to pay one guy.  I have no problem with the one guy.  I really don't.  And everyone else has to just like work for pennies.  And that's their philosophy.  And I don't know how that works out.  In the long term. 
[01:15:30]  I just don't see how that works out.  But that's their strategy.  What the fuck do we know?  Right?  People need jobs, man.  What the fuck do we know?  Did I talk about Tiger?  Well.  A little bit.  A little bit?  Oh, no.  We didn't talk on the air, though.  Oh.  That he fired the guy?  Steve Williams was his rock.  Steve Williams was with him, I think, 12 or 13 years.  I think they.  Alright.  Steve Williams was Tiger's caddy for 12 years.  I think I got this.  And they won 13 majors together, I believe. 
[01:16:00]  13.  I was 14.  Yeah.  And they won.  Look.  And I'm not looking at anything.  And they won 72 tournaments worldwide, I believe.  So what is the word that this happened?  What went wrong?  I just wanted to have some life advice for Tiger.  He's nuts.  And other people.  You know what Tiger's going through?  We all go through it, but we don't realize it.  Did we say he fired him, right?  He fired him.  Okay.  Steve Williams got fired.  Not.  Well, this is an understanding.  Because Steve Williams was really surprised. 
[01:16:30]  Like, what?  Where's this fucking coming from?  He was Australian surprised, too.  He was just like, this is.  I stuck with.  And he kind of snitched a little bit.  But just to get all the info out there, Steve Williams was working with Adam Scott, another  player on the tour.  He got permission.  Who's pretty damn good.  He did get permission.  Got permission.  I would assume.  Steve Williams thought, you know, I'm going to do this so I keep sharp.  Because caddies have to keep sharp as well.  They got to be walking these courses to keep their minds, you know, sharp, whatever.  But go ahead.  No, but I was going to say, Tiger, you could just. 
[01:17:00]  Here's what it is.  Tiger has absolutely no self-awareness and no self-blame ever.  Right.  This is what happens in life.  You ever get those times where you go, you know what?  I think I'm going to kill myself.  Just because I'm in such a funk that I don't even feel like fighting the funk I'm in.  But you have to admit that you're in a funk.  And then sometimes you walk around and you pretend that you're yourself. 
[01:17:30]  But you're not yourself.  Your swag is off.  You know, I'm walking here.  You know, you say hi to a little fat security guard girl that you think, you know, you just go, let me upgrade my swag a little bit by helping some little fat girl out.  Hi, fat girl.  How are you?  And she just goes.  And you go, holy shit.  I was doing that for you.  This fat girl just said, fuck you.  I'm a piece of shit.  You go, your swag is off.  Don't force it. 
[01:18:00]  Tiger is.  His swag is at the ultimate low.  But he won't blame himself.  And he's trying to pretend to be Tiger.  He's running from tournaments.  Just he's scared.  He's not hurt.  He is scared.  What do you need an ACL for to play golf?  And I'm sure you, I'm sure it's golfers that go, oh, you're going to go.  But 47-year-old men are playing golf.  They hurt all the time.  The bat, the thing, the whatever.  They're winning.  An old man won the British Open.  Old, out of shape guy. 
[01:18:30]  Look, 60.  He was 45.  Oh, Darren Clark.  He's a mess.  Because he's a big booze head.  Yeah, Scottish mess.  Northern Ireland.  An Irish mess.  And likes to smoke on the golf course.  And he won.  That's how you can win at golf.  That was a big victory for him.  Tiger can't be in.  There's nothing he can do to be in that bad of shape.  But what he's doing is he's trying to alleviate everybody else thinking that they're the problem.  But Tiger's swag, it's a self-imposed rotting. 
[01:19:00]  Because he feels, it's not that he feels bad for cheating on his wife.  He feels bad for his image being soiled.  All tarnished.  He was the golden boy.  He can't get past that.  Tell them why get rid of the caddy.  Because he was a part of the old days.  Oh.  He's a part of, in some way, see they're trying to say that the guy stood up to him and said,  hey man, you gotta, you have to show yourself to, you have to build back up my confidence in you. 
[01:19:30]  You disappointed me in my family.  I don't believe that that Aussie dude said that, or New Zealand guy.  They don't, they're men's men.  Like, they're dudes.  He was a soldier.  Yeah.  He looked the other way.  He knew exactly what Tiger was up there.  He's a dude.  I don't even think he told Tiger.  I think that was what he did for the news.  But I think in close, he's like, eh, Tiger, you gotta caught messing.  And he's probably had a confidant.  But Tiger got bad.  Somebody he's listening to is giving him bad advice. 
[01:20:00]  It can't be, you know, and his pop is dead, so you don't have a lot of strength with his pop.  Yeah, yeah.  But he has to say, wait a minute.  You cannot force your swagger to come back.  Right.  You have to ride it out like any other wave or any other, I think your swagger's like nature.  Sometimes nature's, you know, we're going through this heat wave.  Uh-huh.  I think you go through the waves of your own spirit.  I think we're attached to nature. 
[01:20:30]  And I think you cannot fight when you're whack.  When you're whack.  When you're feeling good.  When you're feeling good.  You're like, oh, this is just shit.  You just know it.  You point.  You do everything.  Everything goes right.  Right.  When it goes wrong, man.  Don't fight it.  Just don't fight it.  Just let it what?  Let it ride out to you feeling.  Let it run its course of badness.  Like, I'll call a girl a bitch in a minute.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  A strange girl a bitch in a minute. 
[01:21:00]  Hey, bitch.  But if my swag is off, that goes horribly wrong.  Her brothers come out.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You know, the mother comes out.  You know.  Right, right.  Guns come out.  You got to know when.  Because I'll be pretending to still be the guy that says, hey, bitch.  But I'll be like, hey, bitch.  That didn't come out right.  And you don't even remember how to be you.  You're pretending to be you.  You also got to throw into this that there's steroid rumors with Tiger. 
[01:21:30]  They got the rage?  So maybe he's kind of going away so he can cycle out and all that shit.  So faking some injuries.  There's some rumors out there.  It could be.  But he's so big.  But he.  It's mental.  It's mental, man.  I do follow Golov pretty closely.  The game is passing him by quickly at this point.  Well, they got this other little white boy that they're praying ends up being good.  But he's not that good, though.  Who, McIlroy?  Yeah.  He's good.  But he's not Tiger.  He's just a kid.  He's not a prodigy.  He's no Tiger in his prime. 
[01:22:00]  He's good, man.  Not a prodigy.  McIlroy is good.  He's good.  They're all good.  What is he, 21, 22?  They're all good, but they want a Tiger.  There's a whole bunch of young, good players now.  They do need a Tiger.  They need a Tiger.  But I don't know if.  They're hoping McIlroy could be a Tiger.  He can't be.  That's for sure.  I'll tell you why.  Because he's white.  Tiger's Tiger because of all the weird mixture.  The fact that no other.  Not only is he the greatest golfer of all time, you know, was pushing up there, but he also was. 
[01:22:30]  He's an alien to the sport, you know.  Now he's going to fall short of all the records.  Well, he's only 30-something.  He has to get, what, four?  He's going to fall short.  He can't get four?  If his swag gets back up, man, he gets another bitch.  He gets his arrogance back.  Nah, he's done.  You think so?  As far as.  I refuse to say that.  He's done as far as dominating.  And who is his chick?  Why?  He'll win a couple more majors, maybe, and a bunch of, you know, a handful of tournaments here and there. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Elin's fucking his head up.  He needs to just stop it.  He's done as far as dominating, though.  Who is she fucking now?  I don't know.  It's just incestuous world.  She just jumped on somebody that I believe was going out with someone Tiger was fucking.  Used to fuck Yucatel.  Yeah, yeah, Yucatel.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I did hear that.  Yeah.  So there's a whole fucking thing going on.  But she's Yucatel, though.  Tigers, they pass them around.  Yeah.  They, you don't get, that's why you go, why do these, these same girls fuck these same guys?  Right, right. 
[01:23:30]  They, they can't go out and go, hi, how are you?  One guy runs through and he goes, I'd like to introduce you to my lovely whore.  Oh, my lovely whore.  One of them wipes them up, man.  She was a fucking nanny or something.  My lovely whore.  But don't you kind of see that in the comedy world, too, where some of the girls have been with a bunch of the guys?  I think it's everywhere.  It depends on, uh.  It's everywhere.  Yes.  It's probably the same type of shit.  The athletes are passing the same girls around.  Showbiz.  Look at Hollywood.  The comedians are passing the same girls around. 
[01:24:00]  Look at fucking Hollywood.  Come on.  One guy's fucking this one.  They make another movie.  She's fucking this guy now.  That's all.  It's all within your circle.  Any set you go on, right?  Yeah.  Any time you go on a set, movie set, TV, just go in there, look at who got a wedding ring on.  Uh-huh.  If it's the grip, let's say the grip's married, go, so you're married to the electrician, or you're married to the gaffer.  Oh, I'm married to the script editor.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's incestuous.  It's very incestuous.  I don't want to lose this guy. 
[01:24:30]  He's telling me that he's friends with Tiger's ex.  James, is this true, sir?  Oh, God.  That's good.  Is your name James?  Yeah.  Then, of course, I'm talking to you.  No, I didn't say he was friends with his ex.  Stevie Williams' wife and Elon are good friends.  Tiger and him haven't been talking for six months.  That's why he got rid of them.  Oh, my.  Please tell me the broads didn't get involved.  Of course, man.  He got no goddamn.  Oh, my God.  Tiger got no code. 
[01:25:00]  He's never been.  Nah.  You heard his messages?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Not for a second that he go, I'm Tiger Woods.  Shut up, bird.  Shut up.  Erase that message, and please don't.  Let me make it about myself here and Anthony.  My stupid ex, when Ant was going through that hell-on-earth divorce thing.  Horrific.  In the early days of that whole thing, I find out my ex is driving her to the fucking lawyer's office. 
[01:25:30]  That's great, man.  I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?  Thanks.  How do you think this is the right thing to do?  Right.  She accepted a cruise on my fucking Amex.  I paid.  No, I know, but just the fact that she accepted the cruise on my fucking ex's Amex, which, you know, I live and learn.  So I know this shit.  Me and Ant are, you know, we're tight, and my ex is helping his ex fuck him over.  The last girl I was with for long term, when we broke up, I was at the Borgata at the time, and she's just like, yeah, I'm leaving. 
[01:26:00]  I was like, all right, yeah, here's the key to the room.  She goes, no, I'm leaving.  She goes, I'm going back to the house.  I'm getting a fucking U-Haul.  I'm fucking leaving.  I'm like, okay.  I went to the dealer.  I go, hold up.  Hold up on the deal.  I pushed back from the table.  I got my phone.  I dialed American Express.  Yes, could you cancel card number 36, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Canceled all the fucking cards.  It's like, all right.  I made another call. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, she's come back to the house to grab some shit.  Just be there and make sure she just takes her shit.  Okay.  You know why?  To learn the first time.  You live and learn.  You live and learn.  Don't be a nice guy.  Don't nice your way out of your own happiness, my friend.  This guy, fuck that.  It's the trickle-down theory, my friend.  Oh, I went to the bank to get half the money out.  That was great when I did that, when I was getting a divorce.  Let me go down there, and I'll take half the money out, leave her with half, and we can,  you know, go on to that.  Yeah, man, she's a nice person. 
[01:27:00]  And I went down there, and I filled out my withdrawal slip, and I went in the bank.  One of the greatest moments I ever saw.  Let me get the manager.  Yeah, Mrs. Cumia has emptied this account.  But there's, you know, $1.50 left in here.  A joint account?  Oh, yeah.  So a joint, you can't take more than half in a joint, right?  Oh, no, you can't.  Oh, you can take it all.  Oh, you can take it all.  You can take it all.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She took the whole motherfucker. 
[01:27:30]  Joint account.  Either person could take all of it.  Took it all.  You really got to trust someone to have a joint account.  And there I am going like, yeah, I'm going to tell.  I'm like, motherfucker, I'm taking half that money, but I'm taking it right now, motherfucker.  Fuck her.  And I get there, fuck her, fuck me.  And you wasn't even saying fuck.  She took the whole thing.  You wasn't even saying fuck her.  No, I wasn't.  I was just saying, this is fair.  Hold on, hold on.  I was a witness's whole thing.  Yeah.  And I swear to you, that's exactly what Ant said he was going to do. 
[01:28:00]  That's the fair thing to do.  And I was in the lobby of that bank when that conversation went on.  I went, oh, no, no, no, no.  But here's a dude, though.  This is dudes.  I left like the mayor of Amity when Brody wanted him to sign the paper in the hospital.  But I was just at the bank.  I had money.  Let me go back to James.  So you're saying that the two wives there are really close, right?  Correct. 
[01:28:30]  And because of that, it messed up the relationship Tiger had with Steve Williams?  Yeah.  Steve came back to the United States to caddy for him.  And he stayed in Oregon instead of Florida.  Tiger didn't talk to him for six months.  Fuck.  Steve Williams should have got rid of his wife.  Yeah, but not really, though, man.  That's really, to be honest, do cold, man.  You really rise above women's shit.  If my girl, I wouldn't give a fuck if my girl was with her girl doing shit. 
[01:29:00]  It's just one effect.  That's what a girl's supposed to do.  It's like, what are you going to do?  Steve Williams' wife should have understood that maybe you break off that friendship for a while.  Get the fuck out of here.  You just basically.  That's what you do.  But that's like you just.  I'm sure she has plenty of friends.  How close were they really?  Who even says that?  They walked around the course together once in a while?  She didn't have plenty of friends, man.  The life is incestuous, man.  She didn't have plenty of friends.  And the thing is, you just raise the bitch right.  You just go, look, man. 
[01:29:30]  Stay out of that shit.  Talk what you talked before you and her had a problem.  Don't.  I'm not going to tell her not to talk to the bitch forever.  Please don't talk to Tiger's ex.  Yes.  It ain't going to happen.  That's strange.  It ain't going to happen.  Well, she should have done that on her own is what I'm saying.  She should have probably realized, oh, this is a little touchy situation.  Every group is still in their own circle.  You rarely go out of your circle if you break up with somebody to find something extremely new. 
[01:30:00]  Like if you're at an office building and you have an inter-office relationship and you break up with that person,  you're probably going to get together with somebody else at the office.  Right.  You know, it's just everyone's yapping to each other.  Bringing it back to us, though.  Of course.  We obviously had, me and my ex had issues, okay?  And it certainly helped move things along when I realized, you're helping out Anthony's wife to fuck him over?  How is that going to be good for us? 
[01:30:30]  There was a situation where your woman said to you, like she said to you, don't talk to Anthony.  How could you, if y'all were tight and, you know, your wives are tight, the whole thing.  And something happened where she goes, how could you help Anthony stop being Anthony's friend?  If your woman said that to you.  Right.  Because, I'm trying to think of the issue to reverse it. 
[01:31:00]  She almost did.  But it's like, you can't talk to you anymore.  I think your ex almost did tell you that.  Jesus.  Because she was real pissed at me when I, you know, moved along.  Oh, was she angry with me?  But I never always said.  I don't give a shit.  I'm fucking, I'm miserable with my wife.  Hold on, hold on.  It's like, my friendship with.  But this thing with me and Ann and our exes is, it goes really deep.  Because for some reason, my ex at the time was extremely angry at Anthony because he's  getting a divorce. 
[01:31:30]  And anyone that was in that circle at the time realized that that marriage had some issues  and Ann was not fucking happy.  She couldn't see that because she had a father that left her family.  So, watching Anthony leave his wife brought back all these fucking memories.  I know, kids.  It was none of her business.  But what if your woman said, they don't want you to be friends with it?  Like, what if she was mad because you were supporting Anthony in this whole situation?  Yeah, do the show and everything.  But off the show hours, no communication. 
[01:32:00]  You'd be like, fuck you.  Yeah, I would.  Fuck him?  No, I wouldn't say fuck him.  Fuck the broad.  Fuck the broad.  I mean, you can't explain.  So, at the end of the day, you got to understand that.  But look, I'm not my girls or never have ever been a friend with my woman's friends.  Or my male friends' wives.  My good friend of mine at the time, his wife left him. 
[01:32:30]  She left me too.  Yeah, yeah.  If I see it in the streets, I'm like, your credit card was only good because, like you  said, you called the bank.  Yeah, yeah.  It was only good because.  The bank was called.  Yeah.  The credit's no good here.  There's obviously no easy answer, Patrice.  It's complicated, you know?  It depends how tight your relationship is, I guess, to begin with.  When you break up, there are people that you just won't ever see or talk to again.  And that's the plain and simple fact.  Out of, I don't miss anyone from my ex's circle except one guy. 
[01:33:00]  And I saw him once, you know, he is married to her sister.  And I'm bummed that we're not friends anymore.  Why can't you be friends?  It just seems.  Because I don't want any.  You don't want to be tied in.  I don't want any connection to that shit.  Yeah, you don't want to be tied in.  So sometimes, you know.  With knowing.  Unfortunately, when you break up with someone, you lose some people that, you know, you probably  would really like to still, you know, hang with.  I don't want to know.  I feel very good friends with an ex-girlfriend, someone I met through my ex-girlfriend. 
[01:33:30]  Really?  And he could care less.  He's not like, oh, you love.  He's just.  Patrice?  I don't know anybody.  I respect that.  I understand that.  But I think that is.  That's an anomaly.  Yes.  I believe so.  Not with dudes.  Why would you say that?  I think we could go to the phones right now, and a lot of people have stories.  Man, fucking you talk to these fucking guys that's going to call in a.  I respect their opinion.  Fucking competitive hot dog eaters.  They got no fucking insight.  Or toes. 
[01:34:00]  I think it's very normal when you break up with someone in a long relationship, especially,  that, yeah, you break up with that whole fucking side.  Here it is, Patrice.  I have friends with all kind of motherfuckers I've met.  All depends.  Because my personality or your personality is not based on when you make friends with  somebody in your girl's circle.  For dudes, it's not based on fucking.  We don't become friends with people we don't like.  Look, here's.  So when we like a guy, it's like, that's my boy.  No, no, no.  Here's the deal. 
[01:34:30]  I got one ex that I still see her sister and her brother-in-law and kids and everything.  That's fine.  I have no problem with that.  You still see them to this day?  To this day.  Just the other day, they were over the house.  But then there's other relationships where I don't want to even fucking know one person  that is even close to that fuck.  I just don't even want to know.  So I think it has to do with how you left. 
[01:35:00]  Well, it seems like you have the personality where you wouldn't be tight.  I had an ex-girlfriend.  Her sister was a hunk of shit.  And her sister's boyfriend was a hunk of shit.  I didn't speak to either one of them.  I stared at them.  And I love that uncomfortable, we don't like each other shit.  I'm with your fucking.  That's why I don't get uncomfortable.  If I meet somebody's parent, some woman at my age, her mother.  I'm not like, hi, mister.  I'm like, hey, how you doing?  And I hope you know that I'm going to upgrade for your stupid daughter. 
[01:35:30]  And I feel like that.  So the guy, I never talked to the people that I didn't like.  So I ended up being tight with Gavin.  Gavin is a friend.  I met him through an ex-girl.  She's mad that we're friends, but we are friends.  Patrice, I'm really starting to let all this soak in.  I'm thinking about it.  I think maybe in my circle, the friendship I had with that one person that I do miss  out of that whole circle, maybe we weren't close enough to continue past the breakup. 
[01:36:00]  You were friendly because you was with her.  I like the guy.  And then you dumped her off because, you know.  And I can't speak for him, whatever.  We related to each other, let's just put it that way.  But maybe, yeah, maybe the friendship wasn't that strong to last past the breakup.  Because it was rooted in familiarity.  I had an ex-girlfriend and she had a brother.  I wasn't friendly with them.  I was friendly with the people I was friendly with. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, and that's the only example I got to go on.  So I guess I assume that you just have to break up with the entire circle because that's  what I did.  But you're better than that.  And I don't have other ex-relationships where it's applicable, I guess.  You're better than that.  You're better than that.  Well, this guy's saying you're crazy.  Joe in Arkansas says, Patrice O'Neill is crazy.  Why, Joe?  He is.  Like Opie says, you're friends with a lot of people.  Maybe Patrice is different because he'll snob the people that he's, you know, oh, just 
[01:37:00]  because you're so-and-so's brother or you're so-and-so's friend, I don't have to talk to you.  But when you're in a long-term relationship, you end up having activities with people.  Well, when you try to get with those people afterwards, it's still based on the fact that,  hey, you're from so-and-so.  And whether you end it or they end it, I would say probably in 98% of all guys' relationships,  when the exes go, the friends with them go too.  I got to tell you, I think Patrice completely turned me on this whole issue. 
[01:37:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  That fast.  Because I think the friendships weren't strong enough to-  They weren't real.  Or real.  And this guy-  Because now I'm starting to think of, there was another guy in that circle whose wife was  really close with my ex, and I really liked him too.  And he's in the business, not radio, but like in the media business.  So we related at parties and stuff, and we talked, and I really liked the guy a lot.  And we tried to keep it going after that whole thing, but it just was kind of awkward.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And then I realized, oh, I guess we don't really have much in common past the fact that we used 
[01:38:00]  to hang because our girls were close.  The guy, Joe, Joe from Walker's home?  Because Noah turned me, when you said Gavin, I went, fuck yeah, because I know how close  you are with Gavin.  And of course, Gavin, who's been on our show a bunch of times with Patrice, he's the type  of guy you don't let go.  He's a solid fucking dude.  He's a dude, man.  He's a dude.  So he's a dude, man.  I think you just turned me on the whole fucking thing.  I think the relationships that I had that were in the circle because of my ex weren't 
[01:38:30]  strong enough to survive that, obviously.  Right.  And if you hear Joe from Arkansas, he's saying the same thing.  You hear what he said?  He said there's activities you do together.  Like you go with the wife and ding bowling.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the thing.  People call me an asshole, but I'm a guy.  I love women.  I don't love women.  I love them all.  Yeah, yeah.  So to be with one girl, it takes a lot of things that you have to figure out how to make 
[01:39:00]  yourself happy.  And one of them is I don't do a lot of activities with her.  With her?  I don't.  Or with her friends.  I just think compromise.  I got four televisions in my house.  I don't...  Compromise means one of us has to be unhappy.  I don't want to watch your shows.  I don't want to go out.  I don't like bowling.  I don't like going to the beach.  She went to the beach with all her friends.  See, that's the thing.  This is the problem.  What beach does she hang out at?  I think it's somewhere in mid-Jersey. 
[01:39:30]  You don't want to tell me that.  But it's like you...  The way we are, we become close friends.  Men become...  We mentor each other.  Women aren't friends like that.  They're not true friends.  That's why they think like that.  Why would I...  If something happened with you and Oak, and it's like...  I wouldn't fucking choose sides.  I'd be like...  I'm still your friends.  Right, right.  I'm not going to fucking choose. 
[01:40:00]  That's not dude shit.  It's not the way we do things, man.  You're right.  That isn't dude shit.  But it is relationship shit with guys and girls.  You're right.  But it usually happens like...  I could be close friends with somebody.  And this happened to me with one relationship.  Close friends with somebody.  Dude.  Always hanging out.  And then when the breakup happened...  I saw one drifting over to the other side. 
[01:40:30]  And then wound up, you know, fucking me over in some way, shape, or form with giving her  information and shit like that.  And that, to me, was like, goodbye.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  But that person would go, oh, you changed.  Yeah, well, I don't give a shit what that person thinks.  No, I know.  I'm just saying.  I know exactly who you're talking about.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was pretty amazing to watch go down, by the way.  That's when men become not friends.  It was when one...  But that's why, like, from the training day scene, where it's like, hey, man, just take 
[01:41:00]  this money.  Right, right, right.  It's dirty money, man.  That's how we become friends.  It's like, I can't allow you to just...  Dirty money, man.  Let me go to Heather.  Is it Heather Hite?  Hey, hi.  How are you?  Is it Heather Hite?  It's just Heather.  All right.  I only know one Heather from Long Island.  I thought that was you.  All right.  Heather, what's going on?  No.  Well, I was married 13 years, and, you know, we had the same friends, and it's true.  When you break up, you try to say you're not going to take sides, but it always ends 
[01:41:30]  up one side gets one set of friends, the other side gets the other set of friends, and  that's how it always is.  I think girls pick sides way before guys pick sides.  I agree with Patrice on that.  Yes.  But isn't it a...  Can I ask you a question, Heather?  Yes.  How did you have friends?  Usually, one person comes in with the friends.  Like, so, it's not that you have friends.  It's that either, and I suspect he had friends, and then you became friendly with the friends 
[01:42:00]  he had, because that's what usually happens.  He has a friend that has a wife or a girlfriend.  You meet her.  You like her, and you go, I like her, and now all of you are friends.  No one comes in with mutual friends, because that doesn't make any sense.  Let me tell you something.  You're right.  Because you have half a life.  I have friends.  Hold on two seconds.  I have friends that I had before I got married.  I am still friends with them, but any friends that were made during the marriage, I have 
[01:42:30]  not seen.  Because those were your friends.  Right.  She infiltrated.  I came in with one friend.  I'm still friends with her.  But the mutual friends I had, you know, that he came in, I don't speak to anymore.  We started for a little bit, but now I got remarried, and my husband now has long friends  like 15, 20 years.  So we kind of made a rule with each other.  I'm absolutely friendly with them when we have functions, we get together, we have a  great time.  But I don't call them with problems, or I don't call them to chat, because when it 
[01:43:00]  comes down to it, girls are vindictive bitches, and they will find anything to pick a fight  over.  And I don't want my husband to ever have to feel like he's got to choose between me or  his friends.  So we just do functions together, and we're friendly, and that's pretty much it.  I don't call them.  They don't call me.  You know, I keep my girlfriend, and he'll do functions with them, but he doesn't get  friendly with their husbands either.  Because it just won't work in the end. 
[01:43:30]  All girls are vindictive.  They want to make a problem.  They want to cause drama.  And it's just bullshit.  They do like the drama.  Oh, yes, they do.  Yeah.  All right, Heather.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Have a good day.  Yeah, to this day, I'm embarrassed how some of that shit went down with Aunt and I's exes.  Oh, God.  Driving her to the lawyer office, going on a cruise with her.  I'm like, what are you fucking doing?  I'm like, wait, she went on a cruise.  She brought Opie's chicken.  It's like, oh, that's on my American Express card? 
[01:44:00]  Really?  I paid.  I paid.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it was like, just the goal that she would do that.  It's just amazing.  It's like, but what is the difference, though?  Let's, let's.  Well, can I.  Hold on.  Just so you got all the facts.  I mean, this wasn't a typical divorce, man.  She wanted fucking Aunt's heart.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I'm just saying.  I mean, because I know people get divorced and all that shit.  What is the difference between you two being friends?  Yeah.  What is the difference between you two staying friends and them two staying friends?  The difference. 
[01:44:30]  We're like business partners, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we're a business, you know, we have a business together.  We're still friends.  We're, you know, we have very different lives now.  No, I mean, in the scope of that situation.  In the scope of that situation.  In the scope of that situation, actually, me and Aunt, back then, we're a lot closer than  we are now.  Yeah.  Just because of, you know, what was going on in our lives were similar.  Lifestyle shit.  But we also had an amazing radio show that we were keeping together.  They were friends in commiseration.  Right.  Not friends in, hey, I don't, I honestly don't think they enjoyed each other's company. 
[01:45:00]  It's that thing mutual.  It's like, oh.  Yeah, yeah.  They had something in common.  They fucking hated these guys that fucked them over.  I didn't even fuck my ex over.  I'm saying they're, that's their.  You didn't fuck your ex over either.  I'm just saying that's their point of view.  Because we're good guys, believe it or not, in the end.  That's their point of view.  Absolutely right.  And I would bet money, and I don't know because I don't give a fuck, but I would bet a lot  of money, actually, that they're not even friends anymore. 
[01:45:30]  Probably not.  They're probably not even friends anymore.  Well, I did see one picture of a marathon or something that your ex was in, and my ex  is standing there kind of like, hey, giving her a little smile.  Now, would it change, if you thought they were still close friends, would that change the  whole idea of what you're talking about right now?  What do you mean?  If they were still friends since then?  No, no.  I'm guaranteeing they're not friends.  And I don't know.  I'm guaranteeing.  I don't know either, but I saw a picture on someone's Facebook.  It was a picture of both of them, and it was like, I think it was your ex going, oh, 
[01:46:00]  and here's my good friend Jennifer.  I don't know when that was taken, what it was, where it was from, but I think their whole  friendship was based on the mutual disgust of their previous relationship with us and  stuff.  They were unhappy.  I love that.  They could get all catty with each other.  They were unhappy.  We were unhappy, but we were so distracted by the radio show that, you know, but they 
[01:46:30]  were unhappy with having nothing else to distract.  I don't give a shit.  Clean the cat box, you fucking pig.  That was my fucking thing.  How about when I come home, don't try to treat me like a hubby, like the normal run of the  mill just got home from work hubby to take the garbage out.  How about you get your fucking ass out there and haul the pails to the curb?  I just did a radio show.  I can't believe you're the same guy.  Oh God.  I wish I was this guy that back then.  It's amazing.  Oh, I wish I was this guy back then. 
[01:47:00]  I'm thinking about doing the whole plunge, like my woman, but I'm going to tell you other  than finances and this and that, look, I put her through enough where I think if she wanted  to fuck me, she could never really get back at me for the mental abuse, but this may seem  so petty, but you know what I don't want to do?  I don't, and it's getting there because we've been together so long.  I don't ever want to have a discussion about everything.  I don't want to have a meeting about anything I want to do, anything I say. 
[01:47:30]  I want to go here.  I don't want to, I don't want to have to always discuss to a committee.  I had a friend come up and he wanted to bring his girl and crash at the house and my girl  had something to say, like whatever she had to say was, it was inconsequential.  It was just the fact she, I got to, you know, I have to go, I have to hear that you might  not be into it.  Like that whole, we're a, we're a partner and we have to, everything has to be discussed. 
[01:48:00]  No, like I, I, I bought $800 shoes.  I just want to buy them.  I don't want to ever think I have to discuss, is that a wise thing to do to justify that  you decide you just want $800 shoes.  I think the partnership is what bothers me.  That idea of, of, yeah, you're, you're now a business partner and a, a partner in property 
[01:48:30]  and a partner in decisions.  And especially, I don't know where you are with your woman now, but especially in the  beginning, my thing is there's a time where in their heads, they feel like they, they shouldn't  say something.  Like, so when you first meet them, they got nothing to say, but it's almost like they're  trying to get promoted or upgraded to this place where they think they have an entitlement  to actually say things in your life.  And I don't want to discuss anything that I want to do. 
[01:49:00]  I just want to do what I want to do.  Here's, here's the, the, the, the Anthony of, of now.  I don't discuss anything.  I go, Hey, guess what?  So-and-so, so-and-so, so-and-so is coming over and going in the pool and they're hanging  out today.  Hey, I just got a call.  This one's coming over.  Just going to drink a few beers.  It's not, can this person, and it used to be.  Uh, is it all right with you if this person comes over?  And there are certain circumstances where I'm not just fucking blind to everything. 
[01:49:30]  If, if the girl's sick or something, I'm not going to be inviting a party over the house.  I do have some compassion.  But if we're just hanging around and, and, and the, the evening pretty much looks like  we're going to be hanging out watching TV or, or something.  And I get a call that, that people want to come over and hang out.  I'm not going to say, Hey, do you mind if people come over?  And that isn't out of being rude.  It's out of, I want that.  I want people to come over.  I want to hang out.  And that's what's going to happen.  It's no disrespect.  It's me. 
[01:50:00]  It's my fucking house.  And this is what's going on.  You want to take a weird call today?  The king of my castle, Norton.  You want to take a weird call today?  Yeah.  Dennis from Babylon dated my ex after we broke up.  Oh.  So he says.  And also knows your ex.  Oh, I know how to be good.  Dennis, who are you?  Who am I?  Yeah.  I'm a big ONA fan from like the NAW days.  There's no way my ex would have went out as an ONA fan.  Dennis, where are you from?  There's no way. 
[01:50:30]  Babylon.  I'm from Babylon, yeah.  Babylon.  I was actually, yeah, I was actually hanging up in Huntington one night.  And I did not know your ex from all in a while.  I just actually started talking to her.  Which one are you talking about?  Mine.  I'm talking about Opie's.  All right.  And I was at this Mexican restaurant next door to Opie's Brothers Restaurant.  I forget the name of it.  Oh, yeah.  She used to, I did know this because my brother told me this.  She was trying to tell the whole fucking town not to go to FH Riley's because I'm a bad guy. 
[01:51:00]  We're all bad guys.  That's good.  Even though I did the right thing when the relationship broke up.  And then she would hang out, I did know this, at the Mexican joint right next door to ours.  And that's where I met her.  So I think this guy's telling the truth.  Go ahead, Dennis.  How was it?  What, the Mexican?  No.  How was the box?  Was it delicious?  Go ahead, Dennis.  I don't give a fuck what he says.  Go ahead, Dennis.  Continue with your story.  I hear it.  It smells in my finger.  She was cool to talk to, but I had mentioned that I had just come from FH Riley's and I  was hoping to run into you guys being a big fan. 
[01:51:30]  And she was like, oh, so you're a big fan of ONA.  I was like, yeah, yeah.  I listen to him all the time.  Yada, yada, yada.  I went out and got XM exclusively just for you guys.  Right, exactly.  And she said, well, you know, my brother's name is Rick.  And then it started dawning on me that, oh, my God, Rick Delgado, the producer.  And my jaw just fell on the bar.  Another winner, by the way.  But go ahead.  Yeah, so it just so happened that, you know, she was your ex. 
[01:52:00]  So, you know, we had fun that night.  I was with a buddy of mine and we were all drunk.  So, I mean, she was cool about everything.  So we agreed to meet up another night in another bar in Huntington.  And it just so happens that Anthony's ex-wife was there.  What year was this?  What a treat this sounds like.  I would say this was about four years ago.  You almost know our hell.  Go ahead.  You're a lucky devil.  Oh, dude, did she get completely snotted drunk?  Well, I don't know whether she was drunk or not, but I didn't know it was her because 
[01:52:30]  I don't know her on site until Opie's ex whispered in my ear that that's Anthony's ex.  Ah.  And she.  I hope you didn't.  I hope you didn't mention fathers when you were my ex because that would have ruined your  fucking night.  No, no, nothing like that.  I just I just felt very.  Leave me out of your conversations.  That's not to you, Dennis.  So what?  Have a life without me.  I don't remember a lot about the only thing I really remember that stood out was that 
[01:53:00]  Anthony's ex was just very standoffish and looking at me like I committed some kind  of a crime.  Just the feeling of ill.  He was there.  Oh, yeah.  He was there.  This is the real deal.  He was there.  This is the real deal.  She would look at me.  You were in the Billy of the Beast, my friend.  You were there, man.  You didn't even know.  You were right by fucking Godzilla and Mothra.  You didn't even know it.  And I was just not having a great time. 
[01:53:30]  I decided.  Neither would we.  I was on good terms.  Opie's ex called, I don't know, maybe a couple days later and mentioned something about celebrating  Passover or some other Jewish holiday.  And that was it for me.  I was done.  She's not Jewish.  So nothing happened?  She dated her?  That's what Opie's ex mentioned to me.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Did he date her or he just met her?  Did he get a, you know.  No, no.  I never had any relations with her whatsoever.  I only went out with her, I think, two times, maybe three at the most.  So maybe dating is the wrong word. 
[01:54:00]  Hanging out is more like it.  Yeah, she was good at hanging out.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  That was about it with her.  And that was about it.  Don't get me fucking started.  Thank you, Dennis.  I didn't have much anything else to add.  Sounds like a treat.  What an evening.  Yeah.  Anyway, I'll see you guys next Thursday at the Hard Rock.  Oh, sounds good.  How about that?  Yeah, that's going down.  If you want to be part of the Hard Rock Cafe broadcast next Thursday, 8 to 10 a.m.,  excuse me, go to our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  And you have to RSVP and all that.  So I want to fill that joint up. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yuck.  Ugh.  I'm all like yuck now.  Are you?  Why?  Yeah.  I hate thinking about that fucking mess.  Just because of the damage.  Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.  Sweetie, sweetie, please, look, we're going out tonight.  Could you please not drink too much?  And if you do, just remember, like right now, there's no problem, right?  Yeah, I know.  There's no problem. 
[01:55:00]  So like in like a few hours when we're hanging out, there's still going to be no problem.  No, I know.  I know.  So after some shots of Jack, like, like, remember, just try to remember that we're not  having an argument.  There's no fight.  There's no problem.  This is you talking to her.  Yeah, yeah.  This is every night before we went out.  That's not like what a woman would say to a guy.  Oh, no.  It's like, please.  No, no.  I know.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Fast forward.  Not even fast forward.  Just quickly hit fucking one chapter ahead on the remote after a few shots. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Fucking piece of shit.  Fucking.  I don't need your bullshit.  It's like, remember when we talked at the house?  Remember?  Look, look.  I'm trying to be civil here.  We spoke at the house.  Do you remember me saying there wasn't a problem?  Well, there is now, motherfucker.  Was you a square before? 
[01:56:00]  You was with her while you was a square, right?  Then she was with you on a ride to the radio, right?  No, no.  Right, right.  I got into radio, but I hadn't gotten like any W shit.  So she had gotten with you?  She had a taste of the Boston market.  Okay.  So you weren't like, you weren't the fucking air conditioning guy?  No, no, no.  Once I became the radio guy, I really didn't give a fuck and didn't have those speeches.  No.  She was regular Long Island white trash. 
[01:56:30]  Really?  Yeah.  You didn't know your pretension then.  She caught you.  I was a fucking tin knocker.  Yeah.  The fuck do I know?  I'm fucking trying to, I'm there trying to fucking argue with my boss for a 15 cent an  hour raise and all that Long Island happy horse shit.  Yeah.  I think she was.  Fuck.  I think she was scared of success or something.  She wanted to just be, you know, well, she was scared of on a level.  She was scared of what would have eventually happened.  Oh, she knew the deal.  Yeah.  She, you know, women are horrified. 
[01:57:00]  She was probably just trying to keep Ant down.  This motherfucker makes a few bucks.  Look, man, I'll go.  He's so gone.  Yes.  Ant did fucking nothing wrong.  He cleans up a little bit.  He fucking, you know, puts on some clothes, gets himself a nice car, gets some money under  his belt.  She's so gone.  And she was so right.  But she could have, she could have done some things.  She could have bettered herself and this and that.  Like I said, she had years, years.  She chose not to.  I would say she could have become a doctor in that time. 
[01:57:30]  With all that money and all that time, she could have fucking gone to school and become  a fucking doctor.  Think she blew through everything?  I can only hope so.  I can only hope so.  But horrible women always seem to find somebody who's going to marry them, though.  Can I deal with something, Ant?  Yeah, I don't give a minute.  Once and for all.  Eric in Jersey, go ahead.  Opie, come on now.  You never really paid Anthony back.  Why?  Because that's what you heard on our radio show?  Yeah, and I'm a stupid listener. 
[01:58:00]  Once and for all, we made into some good radio, but I paid Anthony back.  No, I got paid back.  I was mortified by that whole fucking thing.  We had a whole thing where I'm like, I'm not paying you back and all this.  But you get it from her.  Yeah, I said all that.  But of course I paid him back.  I was mortified.  Paying him about what?  For the cruise that my ex took his ex on.  Ant's ex was so depressed, she had to go on a cruise and she brought my girl to time. 
[01:58:30]  And my girl goes, yeah, I'll go.  Y'all motherfuckers had a soap opera back.  God only knows what was going on on that cruise, too.  Probably just drunken, trying to fuck everybody on the boat.  Who knows?  And then Ant's ex thought it was her money.  So she's like, I'm paying for everything.  This is on me.  Hi, American Express.  Yeah, I don't.  We're not doing this.  You can't do this.  I didn't make that charge.  Whatever.  It's one of my employees used the card.  I'm stepping out of character, though.  I was mortified.  And of course, it paid it back. 
[01:59:00]  We made radio out of it, though.  Fuck.  God damn.  Fucking women, huh?  She was the worst.  Oh, my dear, sweet Lord.  Jesus.  I'm due for a big ball kicking.  You don't know all these stories, Patrice?  A big ball kicking.  No, this is NAW.  A big ball kicking.  Are you?  No.  I'm due.  I'm due.  Can I tell Patrice a couple of my favorite moments?  Oh, why?  And you could get me with your favorite moments.  Oh, no.  Me and mine actually.  I believe me.  There's two that always stand out.  We used to drive in together, and we lived probably a half a mile from each other in Huntington. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, yeah.  So we'd take turns driving in.  One guy would deal with the fucking commute, and the other guy would sit back and chill, right?  And I pulled up to Ann's house one day.  Well, there were two.  I pulled up to bring him into the city.  Yeah.  And he's on the front stoop, and she's yelling and screaming at him.  And he just woke up.  I'm like, he gets in the truck.  I'm like, how the fuck is she mad already?  The day hasn't even officially begun.  Yeah, yeah.  What could you have possibly done?  And I think she wanted you to vacuum or something before you went to work. 
[02:00:00]  Your job is to vacuum.  And it's like, don't give me these jobs in the house.  How about my job is to go out to my job, motherfucker?  Right.  And how about you stay home, and you do everything for the fucking house?  Because she wasn't working.  Because she wanted it to be like, oh, I have a say in the house responsibilities.  We got to divvy this up.  And I do this, and you do this.  Fuck you.  By the way, footnote, greatest thing in the world is to call a woman a manswear.  There's nothing better, nothing more fucking exhuming of your soul than to call a girl an asshole or a fucking dickhead. 
[02:00:30]  She was a dick.  Cocksucker.  Motherfucker.  Then the second one, which is even better.  I pull up to Ant's house where he was living at the time.  Wait, wait, oh, is he just, on the way in, is he just staring out the window like, what am I going to do?  No, because I think as soon as we hit the LIE, we were rocking, because we knew we were loving doing the show, and we knew we were going to have more naked chicks, and all sorts of crap. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, it was going to be a lot of fun.  But the drive home was like, yeah, it's got closer and closer to Huntington, you know.  Oh, boy.  So I pull up to Ant's.  Drive slower, motherfucker.  Oh, no, this is even better.  So I pull up to Ant's, and there's candles in the window.  And it's not Valentine's Day or fucking.  There was candles everywhere in the house.  Everywhere in the house.  All I can say is, I don't think there was a light on in the house, but you could see there were a lot of candles lit. 
[02:01:30]  And it's no Jewish holiday or none of that shit, right?  Nice and macabre.  I was like, what's going on?  I go, what the fuck's going on, man?  I went, oh, shit.  It's fucking romance night.  She lit all these candles.  And I'm like, I go, just drive around the block.  Just drive around the block.  So he was just driving around Huntington.  I'm like, all right.  Until he could get himself together to go in the house for romance night. 
[02:02:00]  And you had to fucking stuff it in and try to.  No, no, no.  I had it.  My job at that point was to go in and say something to get her pissed.  So I wouldn't have to fucking deal with her.  Because all I did was I walked in.  The first thing I would do is look to my left and look at that computer.  And no Half-Life was on there.  And then I was only halfway done with that game.  And I wanted to fucking get on that computer and play that game more than anything.  And she's like, I made you dinner and this. 
[02:02:30]  And I'm like, fuck this.  All I want to do is try to fucking.  I got to get through fucking Black Mesa.  I got to figure this shit out.  Did you not.  Was it based on resentment or you wasn't attracted to it anymore?  Not attracted.  The cuntiness took you away.  Cuntiness.  Not attracted.  Resentment.  Wanted out.  Hated the bossiness.  Hated the angry drunkenness. 
[02:03:00]  Was she good in the sack?  At the beginning.  Yeah.  Then it just got like, you know, the belligerent drinking thing was like, I'm a happy drunk guy.  I'll drink.  I'm smiling.  I'm fucking whatever.  She'd have a couple of shots.  And wow.  Kazowie.  She'd be off the rails.  Just be fucking asshole.  Fucking fuck.  And she left you?  Oh, well, she left me for good reason.  No, no, no.  When you bring girlfriends home. 
[02:03:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  Not the reason I'm saying, but she left you.  She made the move for y'all not to divorce.  She made the first move.  Oh, yeah.  Well, she went to the lawyer first.  I'm not saying you made the first move by having bitches in the house.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I left that one day.  It was classic.  She fucking, I'm in the living room.  I'm sitting on the couch with a girl watching TV in my house.  I don't even care. 
[02:04:00]  I didn't tell her not to come home or nothing.  She was out at a bar.  She comes home.  She's all fucking hammered.  She walks in the door.  She's like, what the fuck is this shit?  So the girl turns around and looks.  I'm like, ah, don't worry about it.  Oh, God damn.  And the girl, and she's like, well, I go, you're fucking hammered.  What are you doing?  She goes, I'm leaving.  She turns around and promptly just falls completely forward.  Her head hits the screen door.  And now she's half in and half out laying out of the thing.  And then I turn to the chick that's on the couch with me and I'm just like, yeah, that's 
[02:04:30]  what I'm dealing with.  That's what I'm dealing with.  Please tell me you kept fucking the girl.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't fucking give a shit at that point.  With your wife's ass half in?  Half in and half out the fucking door.  Half in, half out the fucking front door.  And the question that comes up a lot, and Ann has answered this many times, Ann, why'd  you marry the bitch?  That's what Jay is saying.  Oh, because I figured I had to get married to be looked at like a guy and not like a 
[02:05:00]  kid still.  Oh, because every time I would go to the bar that my mom worked at, all the guys would  be like, hey, look, it's Rosie's kid.  Hey, Rosie's son.  Hey, hey.  And I was always like thinking, when am I going to be treated like a guy?  You know?  And I figured, all right, this will help.  So let me just grab this fucking Long Island mess up.  Can I ask you something that I've never asked you before?  Completely hetero.  No, no, no, no.  I will not do that with you. 
[02:05:30]  It's not that bad.  But you're obviously a highly intelligent guy, so why logically does that make sense  in your head that you wanted to be known as a guy?  This is...  I don't understand that.  And I know it was before radio and all that, but you could have had a very happy life being  single and being a tin knocker.  Not a guy guy like that.  I don't understand why you would fall for that.  I was always looked at as a kid.  And I was so irresponsible and everything that I was a kid all the time. 
[02:06:00]  And I was like, I was fucking 30.  But you were willing to settle for something that wasn't right, though.  Not even close to right.  Dude, listen, man.  That's it.  Being a man...  I'm 41.  I want someone to give me some kind of credit when I fill my gas tank all the way up.  Instead of putting 25, I fill it.  It's a man thing to do.  To pay your bills on time. 
[02:06:30]  To buy fucking...  I have dogs.  I buy wee-wee pads for my dogs.  Wee-wee pads.  To go out and buy responsible shit.  Right.  Do responsible shit.  Be a provider.  It's a big fucking deal.  Order your checks.  And being married, that's what marriage is to guys.  It's like, all right, what we are, we're childish creatures.  It can't be right to just want to stick your dick in any pussy anywhere.  I'm going to settle down.  I'm going to buckle down with this one woman and be responsible and be a man. 
[02:07:00]  Motherfuckers do that because that's on page two of the life book.  I'm lost.  You fucking have to do that.  And then when you go to the bar where, you know, my mom is tending bar and you go there  and you got a wedding band on like the other guys that are hanging out there.  Now, you know, hey, hey, buy these guys a drink.  Yeah, there you go.  Look, I'm one of the guys.  Now I'm fucking, I'm an adult.  But did you understand at the time the other side of that that you were going to be in 
[02:07:30]  something that you weren't going to be happy with?  Logic gets overwritten by that shit.  But believe me, if my brain power was able to bash through that wall, it would have kicked  the shit out of that dumbass idea.  There's a lot of kids who are product of.  Oh, yeah.  Of.  Thank God that never happened.  Hey, this is.  That's why these kids are growing up.  So because it's they're unwanted.  Really?  If they're pregnant, they have kids because they really thought it was what they had to  do.  It's like you had to do it.  Got married. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  Now I got a kid.  All right.  Now.  And then they don't want to admit that they resent the kids.  And that makes it even worse.  If they go, shit, I fucked up like you're a fuck up.  You didn't do the kid thing, though.  No, thank God.  You pulled out.  And now, believe me, now I love the fact.  You came on your wife?  That I used to fake that I came.  No, you can't.  And then I'd jack it in the bathroom.  What, did you squeeze lotion on it?  No, no, no.  I would just be like, because she was like, oh, yeah, I want to get pregnant and shit like  that.  And I'm like, oh, so I'd bang and bang. 
[02:08:30]  I'd be like, oh, yeah, that was great.  And then I'd pull out.  She wouldn't feel the gunk?  She would just lay there with a fucking, you know.  She wouldn't look for it?  Well, if it was that far in, if it's like that far in, sometimes it just doesn't come  out on us.  They get up to go to the bathroom.  No, I've never went that far in it.  And shit.  It goes halfway in.  Ann's got a Lincoln log.  So he's fucking, he's shooting right through the cervix.  I was just right through, fucking right into the. 
[02:09:00]  All the cum.  Hit her sternum.  Ann's sperm is hitting the kidney.  All of the kidneys?  Oh, yeah.  I had to make sure it was something like that, you know, like that.  Where the fuck up there?  And then I'd be like, oh, yeah, yeah.  And then I'd go in the bathroom, get rid of it.  That's just, that's just shocking and abusive.  Just because I did not want to have a baby with this fucking woman.  Seriously.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But at what point, though, okay, so you fell for the okie-dok with being with her.  Yeah, yeah.  But how, well, why didn't you fall for the kid okie-dok? 
[02:09:30]  Meaning, so by the time you was going to have kids with her, you had already been to the  brink of misery.  Yeah, yeah.  Far deep into misery.  Because I said, here's the plan.  I go, we'll get married, and then five years, we'll have kids.  Because I want five good years of just hanging out and having some fun, vacationing, doing  things.  And this is when I was still not content.  And then, after five years, we got the job in radio, and I said, look, I can't be having  a kid now.  I'm just kind of this radio game. 
[02:10:00]  Wait, was you with her during that five-year decision?  Yeah, yeah.  I was with her from, like, 1990 to 95, which was when we got into radio.  So, after five years, she's like, I want to have a baby, I want to have a baby.  I'm like, I just got into radio.  I can't be having a kid.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm lost.  I'm lost.  Wait.  That five years you said no radio, was you, I mean, no kids.  Not content, yeah.  You was with her.  Yeah.  So, you were with her when you had a square job.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That means a lot. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  That means a lot.  Radio is what fucked you up.  The fact that you were.  No, radio set me straight.  No, no, no.  It fucked you up with.  It gave him confidence.  It fucked you up with her.  Yes.  Meaning, in her eyes.  Yeah.  That was a supreme upgrade.  Yes.  See, that's important.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She didn't have the ability to see you be a better human being.  Mm-hmm.  So, I thought you were with her in radio, which was a weird story.  No, no, no.  Oh, I never would have gotten that.  And your ex was, you was always kind of in radio, though. 
[02:11:00]  I'm the Doogie Howser of radio.  You were in radio when you hooked up with her, yeah.  Before I did it, I hit puberty, I was doing radio.  And that's not even a joke.  Right.  Yeah.  You, you, that's, that, you were with her a long time.  So, she saw, that's like almost you hit the lottery.  Yeah, that's exactly what the lottery.  And she hit the lottery after that.  Right.  Yeah.  But you can see where, you know, she, she only dealt with losers.  Or, or not losers.  Right.  But, you're right.  Just normal fucking. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Normal Long Island trashy, fucking carpenter, roofer, fucking, and I'm not putting down  those guys, but, you know, believe me, those jobs suck.  I don't want to say true working guys.  And I know it because I was there.  Which is a different mindset.  That's all.  Right.  I don't want to say, yeah, I don't mean loser, but I mean.  Real jobs.  To her, to her, you were the dude that she could deal with.  And then when you got in the radio.  And push around.  Right.  She was like, oh boy.  She wanted, she needed someone that she could push around.  And that's why she'll get married again.  Because women like that, they find dudes, it's always, it's a vicious circle. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  You'll always find a guy who's like, yes, dear.  He thinks he wants that.  But the problem guys don't understand is that women don't like yes, dear guys.  So they, so eventually it becomes really fucking bad.  Let me tell you, time is ticking away, motherfucker.  I can't really see any guys being like, ooh.  Let's, uh.  Ooh, time.  Really?  Tick tock, motherfucker.  When's the last time you've seen her face?  Tick tock.  I don't even remember. 
[02:12:30]  I don't, I, I don't even remember.  What if she called, what if she Facebooked and said, I miss you and I just want to say,  I just want to say sorry for everything I put you through.  If she gives back the money.  Yeah.  Or a big chunk of it.  Give me back every dime.  That she stole.  You didn't get that money back in court?  No.  Oh, no, no.  That was long gone.  They just were like, no, no.  That was just the beginning.  That didn't get it back.  I then had to pay more.  Yeah, that was just the beginning.  And then what's the, what's the, um.  Patrice, hold on.  There wasn't even that much in the account.  No.  It was everything to him. 
[02:13:00]  What's the statute of, of, of alimony?  Like, how long do you have to pay?  It's all settled.  It's a settlement.  So, like, it could be, it could be forever.  It could be forever.  Yours was what, 10 years?  Mine was as long as the marriage was, nine years.  How does that watch?  And Dominic Barber, that, that, that fuck, that lawyer, he actually wanted to put in that  if she died, I'd have to pay her heirs and keep paying them.  For the whole nine years.  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  But they must have wanted more than nine.  Oh, they did.  Yeah, they did.  They wanted more than nine.  They wanted more than that.  They wanted, I settled on it.  First day of trial.  First day of trial.  He's questioning me.  I'm looking.  And in the stand, there's a daily news and a post guy and photographer and shit.  And I'm, I'm having to say shit.  And I'm like, you know what?  I go, your honor, I want to talk to her in a room.  So I took her into a room.  I said, look, realistically, and I go, don't be an idiot.  What do you, what do you want? 
[02:14:00]  And she gave a figure out.  I gave a figure out.  We went back and forth a few times.  I went, all right, I'll live with that.  Let's fucking sign some papers and get this done.  And that was it.  Settled.  And you've been off the hook for how long?  Like three years?  I've been off the hook for three years, yeah.  Does that feel?  Oh, oh.  Now, does that money, just do you notice it not being gone every month now?  Yeah, I kind of do.  You just be like, oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I ain't got a raise.  I had to deal with that.  A few years back.  Was it low fives? 
[02:14:30]  High fours?  It was, I can't go into any figures.  No, I mean, like, you know, four digits, high five digits, low four digits, high five digits.  Oh, you're talking hundreds of thousands every few months.  I'm not kidding you.  I'm not kidding.  It was, it was infuriating. 
[02:15:00]  Infuriating.  For nine years.  Yeah.  For nine years.  Yeah.  For nine years.  Nine years.  Holy.  Let's take that.  You are so lucky you didn't come in that bitch.  Oh, my God.  Exactly.  That's what I think of all the time.  I think all the time, like, thank God I pulled out.  I fucking faked it.  I fucking came so many times.  There was probably two sperm left.  Because you, your kid would only been four. 
[02:15:30]  Right?  No.  No, no, no.  Not old.  95, 2005.  No, I'd be about 16 years old.  16 right now.  It would be 16?  Yeah.  Well, no.  Because you were married to the 90s and got married.  Yeah.  You didn't have anything for five.  Five years.  That would have been 95.  So, if you had got pregnant when you wanted to.  On schedule, it would have been 95.  Okay.  On schedule.  That's a 16 year old now.  That's a 16 year old.  So, you would have two more years.  No, no, no.  Five more years.  Yeah.  Plus, the kid would be a teenager now. 
[02:16:00]  And he would be a complete asshole.  And I'd still be paying.  Oh, treating you like fucking dirty dad.  And I'd still be paying child support.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  For another five years.  Oh, ho, ho.  Thank God.  Dad, he'd be over there with his fucking young girlfriends in your pool.  Well, that would have been the one good part.  That would have been the one good part.  Bring one over for me, son.  Oh, I would have just been banging my kids' fucking girlfriends.  Fuck it.  All right, let's break.  I'm paying for something.  What do you got, Patrice?  Anything?  Yes. 
[02:16:30]  This Saturday, I'm at the Treehouse in Stanford, Connecticut.  And then Monday, I'm in some place called Sag Harbor.  A theater in Sag Harbor.  Could you hook up my brother, or is there comps?  Sag Harbor.  I don't know what it is.  You know, I just go to do the gigs.  I got to do it.  What do you have a guest list?  I don't know what the fuck that is.  I know what it is.  Or I have to pay for his tickets.  You don't have to pay for his tickets.  I just don't.  He wants to go see you badly.  He lives out that way.  Fucking curse me out.  I just found out your brother wants to go to you, motherfucker.  I just plugged it just now. 
[02:17:00]  I'm not cursing you.  I'm at Sag Harbor this Monday.  Let me fucking say I'm there, and then I will deal with it.  I remember my brother texting me, and when you said Sag Harbor, I went, that's right.  Okay, he wants to go to that show.  I didn't realize it was Monday.  Just make sure I have what I needed to get to make sure he's all right.  And then, yeah, Sag Harbor Monday, Treehouse this Saturday in Stanford, Connecticut, and  then I'm making a triumphant return to Phoenix, Arizona.  Phoenix.  I like Phoenix.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  It's a new comedy club in Phoenix. 
[02:17:30]  I got to get in on the next break.  But I'm in Phoenix, Arizona, and it's not the improv.  Stay tuned, you people in Phoenix.  And Big Mama Pros on Twitter.  Because you're tweeting your dates all the time, so, yeah.  That's the easiest way to keep track of the trees.  All right.  I guess we'll change gears after the break.  Stay there.  Sirius XM, the virus.  All right.  This is a little weird.  It's going to be Patrice O'Neill, Warren Hanks.  Man, this is all spoken.  Man, you know I've been enjoying things that kings and queens will never have. 
[02:18:00]  In fact, kings and queens can never get, and they don't even know about it.  In good times, great googly moogly.  Great googly moogly.  I have had my fun, if I never get well no more. 
[02:18:30]  I have had my fun, if I never get well no more.  Oh, my health is fading on me.  Oh, yeah, I'm going down slow. 
[02:19:00]  Now, look at here.  I did not say I was a millionaire.  But I said I've had spent more money than a millionaire.  Yeah, because if I had kept all my money that I already spent, I would have been a millionaire a long time ago.  And women, ooh, women. 
[02:19:30]  Great googly moogly.  Please write my mama.  Tell her the shape I'm in.  Tell her to pray for me. 
[02:20:00]  Forgive me for my sin.  Hey, that's all right.  Patrice, that's all right. 
[02:20:30]  That's Hollywood.  You got to listen to Hollywood, though, man.  That's all right.  You got a voice on it, Patrice.  I'm going down slow.  You just tell my mama, look, I'm out of here.  Ladies, presenting O&A's Guide to a Quick Fix Relationship.  Is your lover's foundation crumbling?  Restore those shattered feelings with one simple question.  Do you want to put it in my ass?  Put it in my shitter.  Put it in my shitter.  Put it in my dirty shitter.  Put it in my dirty shitter.  She needs it so bad that she needs it in the dirtiest way possible.  You don't mind it in your filthy shithole, do you? 
[02:21:00]  We are just disgusting.  Fuck me in my AIDS-infested, filth-ridden, ganky, fucking stankhole shitter.  What the fuck?  Who writes this shit?  If you got nothing better to do right now, why don't you call the show?  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:21:30]  No surprise, Patrice killing it during the break.  We've got to go commercial-free, I think, next time Patrice is in.  We miss a lot of good stuff during the break.  We should go show-free.  Yeah, let's do show-free.  Go show-free.  Want to go home? 
[02:22:00]  Stay home.  We could continue this at breakfast with no pressure.  How great would that be?  That would be fantastic.  Where are you?  In the future, we'll broadcast from anywhere.  You know, you never know.  Like, some of the inane horse shit talk that has no direction or meaning.  Yeah.  Just kind of happens.  Just happens.  What was the, off the air, whose fault is it when two people don't speak?  When two people don't speak, like neighbors.  When one person looks, or two people have each other's phone number, and neither calls, but 
[02:22:30]  somehow you don't, you're not calling me.  Yeah.  I think it's an understanding.  Yeah.  I think it's an energy that, you know, I think you just know.  Both sides just know.  Who the one isn't speaking?  Yeah.  Because I certainly am not speaking.  There's no fault.  Yeah, you don't start the speaking process.  I have a neighbor that's a complete twat.  But thank God he only comes to New York every once in a while.  He's so rich that his apartment is just kind of a stopover. 
[02:23:00]  But when he's there about three or four times a year, he's the biggest fucking dick.  Yeah.  In terms of?  Well, how about when I'm, he's met me about three or four times, and I come out of my  apartment to the garbage chute, because I live in a building, and I'm, you know, I'm  in my home, so I'm really dressed the fuck down.  Nothing but in a garbage chute.  Yeah.  And he'll look at me and go, can I help you?  I'm like, what are you fucking talking about?  I'm your neighbor, you cunt.  What do you say to him?  I didn't say cunt that time, but I said, you're, that time, by the way, I said, I'm 
[02:23:30]  your neighbor.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  And then what does he do?  Oh, and then next time he sees me, ignores me.  I'm like, how are you ignoring me?  We live, we live 500 feet in the air together.  I'm so happy.  We're basically living in a cloud together.  You can't fucking say hi.  People don't understand.  I don't need a relationship, but you can't even say fucking hi.  People don't understand racism.  There's not even, it's a, it's a class thing.  Really?  Yeah.  It's like, he's treating him like, may I help you? 
[02:24:00]  You know what?  But Ope's like this white dude, and he's still like, you know what?  Who are you, you piece of shit?  I don't play this card often, but I'll play it for this scenario.  My, you know, he looks, probably looks down at me because I don't dress the part.  My fucking apartment is three times as big as his.  This cunt.  And I'm going to tell him next time.  Relax.  In a closet where three times it's empty.  I like going to the car dealership dressed as bummy as part.  There's nothing better than buying something and looking as unpleasing as you possibly  can.  It just makes me feel good for some reason. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  I get in situations like that all the time because of what I look like.  Buy jewelry with, with a pair of fucking cut off shorts.  There's nothing better than that.  But you learn about a person, you know, cause I get blown off all the time because I don't  trust the parts.  So they're like, he can't possibly afford anything in this car.  What happened at the fucking bank the other day to me, I walk into the bank and I'm pretty  much dressed like I am now with my fucking militant jacket on and a fucking Wyoming Yankee  cab.  Militia guy.  Just a mess.  Exactly. 
[02:25:00]  I'm a mess.  But I'm going to the bank now to pull some cash out to pay some bills and pay some workers  and shit like that.  So I get a nice chunk of change and I leave my, my escalate keys on the counter where you  fill your paperwork out before you go to the teller and this big fucking sassy black  woman, she's big and sassy, you know, she comes over and she's like, um, anybody lose  some keys?  And, uh, I was like, and she comes up to me and she kind of shows them to me. 
[02:25:30]  I was like, and I tapped my pockets and I'm like, Oh shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're mine for the escalate.  And she goes, she goes, they'll be over here.  And, and I'm thinking like, all right, they'll be over here, whatever.  So I finished my transaction and I go, I go over.  No, not even make me go through some shit.  So I go, yeah, I need my keys.  She goes, yeah, I'm with a customer and she's with a customer and she's, I'm standing there 
[02:26:00]  now and my keys are on the fucking desk and I'm like, give me my fucking keys.  But I'm waiting.  I'm being patient.  And then this one woman, because I'm thinking there's some kind of like confirmation process  that they can't just give keys to somebody.  Right, right, right.  You dig it and see it again.  So I'm just going, I'm jumping through some hoops right now.  But then, uh, the woman that I usually deal with comes over and she goes, Anthony, what's,  what's, what's going on?  I go, I go, this woman's got my, my escalate keys and I can't leave. 
[02:26:30]  So she goes, oh, I'll get them.  So she goes over here and, and they start talking and she goes, oh, I thought you was  kidding when you said that was yours.  I'm like, so she just lied.  I go, I go, I go, well, I'll tell you, I don't look like I'm dressed to drive an escalate,  but can I have my fucking keys?  There's a, there's an out clause for anybody that has a responsibility for fucking up.  Yeah.  It's like something happened on, somebody got somebody fired or something or somebody got 
[02:27:00]  fired.  But it's like, I can't condone getting somebody fired, but you do, you would like to once  in a while.  Sometimes you'd like to, you know, or at least get them really reprimanded.  Like, like one, one thing I, when I, when I'm dealing with a person, when I'm not in  front of them and I don't have ID and I say what my name is and, and, and they go outside  of their pay grade to investigate that Patrice is a girl's name and they go out of their way 
[02:27:30]  to just make life really miserable.  So yeah, you want to, you just want to get one person fired once, once or twice and your  fucking life would be nice just to be able to like, show them, look, maybe next time you  won't fucking do that.  She lied.  She lied about, Oh, I thought you were kidding.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She dismissed you.  She did dismiss me.  Yeah.  And then like played it like, Oh, I like she lied and you just want to catch a lion and 
[02:28:00]  get in trouble a little bit.  And I'm standing there.  She's not acknowledging me whatsoever.  And I'm like, why would I stand here waiting for keys that aren't mine?  Why aren't you inquiring?  Like, Oh, are these your keys?  And there wasn't any criteria and they know me in that fucking bank.  I moved more money through that shit little fucking bank than anyone else.  Sassy black bitches.  Don't ever get reprimanded though.  Never.  You can't reprimand.  You get, uh, uh, I'm taking that trouble, man. 
[02:28:30]  Cause they got a lot of power.  You can't find a lot of sassy black bitches.  Sassy black bitches.  So if you got one, you got to hold on to them and take care of them.  I ain't taking that shit from like the human.  They got rid of the cute sassy black bitch here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They got, what happened?  She was cute too.  And she was got, I like the girl at the front desk there.  I don't know what happened.  I think sassy, I think maybe sassy black bitches.  Maybe she got a better gig.  Sassy's out.  I don't, I don't know.  I think she's got a better gig.  Sassy's out.  I don't think it is.  Cause downstairs they got a couple. 
[02:29:00]  They got a sassy Puerto Rican.  But y'all don't have to deal with the sassy security guard bitches.  I wouldn't even know how to talk to a sassy Puerto Rican.  How do you do that?  There's a sassy Puerto Rican.  Is there a way to talk to a sassy Puerto Rican?  Sassy Puerto Rican girl.  I could talk to a sassy black broad.  Easy.  Really?  Sassy Puerto Rican.  I'd probably look like a fool.  I could talk.  I'd look like an idiot.  I feel like I could talk to the sassy black broad.  I could talk.  But that sassy Puerto Rican.  Oh man.  They could bring Mars in.  That's a whole nother world.  What's sassy Puerto Rican? 
[02:29:30]  Is there even a, I don't even know if there are sassy Puerto Ricans.  There are.  Where's Mars?  There's one downstairs.  They got a sassy Puerto Rican.  What makes her sassy?  Um, it's a, it's a, it's a lack of happiness that, he has an answer for me.  But it's, but, and it's always just true.  It's always right, right there.  It's not just let me pull an answer out of my eyes.  It's like, God, that makes sense.  And this company wants to pay you what for a show?  Get the fuck out of here.  It's a, it's a, it's a, they just, it's just the answer, man. 
[02:30:00]  It's just a, it's just not, it's just a lack.  It's just like you're there and there's just no, you, you feel like there's absolutely,  they know there's no consequence for being not attentive and not friendly.  You know, there's a, there's a, there's a real technique to being friendly where you're  not following me because you think I'm stealing and you're not treating me poorly.  Right.  The best service I've ever had in my entire life, ever, was in a gay supermarket in, uh, 
[02:30:30]  in LA, in, uh, on Santa Barbara.  What makes it a gay supermarket?  It was the pavilion.  It was absolutely gay.  Only sell zucchini, carrots, cucumbers.  Only, only hard, hard torpedo shaped foods.  Fucking hot dogs, bratwurst.  The pudding is hard and, and fish shaped pudding.  Everything, everything is in the shape of a fucking torpedo. 
[02:31:00]  Everything is frozen.  Fucking, the iced tea, the iced tea is dildo shaped iced tea containers.  The apples are carved into complete bowls.  Just around, but it's like.  Is that where we're going in society?  You, you knew this was a gay supermarket?  Well, it was the pavilion in Santa Barbara.  Was it in a gay area?  It, yeah, it was absolutely gay, but it was only, it was only, but it was such a great supermarket. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, I'm sure.  Or, that all the 85 year old men with muscles, that were with each other, didn't bother me.  The old queens didn't bother you?  Did not fucking bother you.  It was, it was the most magnificent experience ever.  I said, sir, where's the grape juice?  Yeah.  And he, the guy takes my hand, and we run over to the grape juice.  He just, he just, he just brings me over to the grape juice, starts pushing my cart. 
[02:32:00]  It, it just was extraordinary.  It was almost like heaven.  Oh, that's great.  All the fucking checkout lines had somebody in there checking shit out.  Every one of them.  Not one person on break.  The nigga's supermarket, one, it's 8,000 people, and one person on the checkout line.  Excuse me.  And it's a black bitch.  I'm on my break.  And she mad.  I'm on my break.  You're going to be surprised if it comes from me instead of Anthony, but what is it with 
[02:32:30]  black people behind the counters?  Like, at Starbucks.  It's just rude.  I'm a Starbucks guy, and there'll be three black people working the Starbucks.  Starbucks is different, though, see.  Yeah, yeah.  Starbucks don't let you be fucking black.  Starbucks gets nerdy black people.  No, man.  They don't seem to let nobody fucking unfriendly.  I've never seen unfriendly black people at Starbucks.  The line was getting completely ridiculous, because out of the three, only one was working,  and the one was sort of looking at paperwork, and I'm like, there's nothing on that paper 
[02:33:00]  that's more important than this line right now.  And then another guy finally comes out of the back all annoyed that he now has to, like,  you know, help cut down this line that's getting ridiculously long.  What, you want coffee, nigga?  Yeah.  That's how I feel.  What, you want coffee?  I talked to the situation.  Like, I was bothering them.  What's that bitch-ass nigga want coffee?  Damn.  What, you want to be up for, motherfucker?  I felt like I was bothering them.  You up, nigga?  Next.  You want to be up?  What is that about?  It was one situation. 
[02:33:30]  I don't see it all the time, you know, to be honest.  I don't, I think it's a lack, first, it's you got to be your boss.  I've run into, I've run into, like, where the, it's the hood.  It's the hood.  Look, I got a car from the hood dealership.  Yeah.  The attitude, I think, look, man, my mother is a hell of a, she's a motherfucker, shopping.  I go shopping with my mom when she's in town, and I go, I think she enjoys the war. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, really?  It's a battle.  And it's not black guys.  It's just not, we don't cause problems.  It's black women, and it's shocking.  Yeah.  My mother, and I'm going to speak, because I love my mother.  But she is brutal.  I'd love an example.  Dude, she makes people at Marshall's individually newspaper wrap plastic cups. 
[02:34:30]  Plastic cups.  What?  Like when you're buying plastic cups, like when you buy fine crystal, they wrap it up in the paper so it doesn't clang together.  And if this was a white woman, you would wrap them up.  Right.  And why won't you, why aren't there stronger plastic bags?  I want to see.  Oh, shit. 
[02:35:00]  I want to know why you have these plastic bags.  And what do you do?  And this was open, and I want you.  Do you stroll away, or do you just.  I go, mums.  Mums.  If it fucking breaks, I don't care.  Look in the back.  See if you have this same thing.  Yeah.  But just from the back.  Wow.  My mother's brutal.  But she's not brutal, like super ghetto. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, yeah.  She's brutal like a whole black lady that ain't taking shit.  Right.  But there's no shit to be tooken.  So she just makes shit.  So she'll make shit.  She's warlike.  Like, my mother's war, she's warlike.  Have you been in a situation with her where you get just mortified and embarrassed?  No, because my mom's is in her 60s, and her feet are swelling up.  And I just, I don't even argue with my mom's no more.  It's like, just let her do it. 
[02:36:00]  Matter of fact, I'm going to tell you something.  I respect and listen to my mother more now because I don't have to listen to her.  Right, right.  So now I kind of appreciate mums.  But she's not even horrific.  Because she talks to, here's what my mother does.  She talks down to people.  Like, she doesn't, she's not like, what?  Like, if you watch that show Hardcore Pawn, if you ever see that show? 
[02:36:30]  Oh, God, yeah.  Where it's like, I have my granddaddy's watch.  What can I get for it?  Well, what do you want?  A thousand?  I'll give you two dollars.  Oh, fuck you and your mama, nigga!  And she shits on the floor.  The woman shits on the floor.  I'll be back with my cousins.  Shoot your Jew ass up.  Sad.  Bitch ass nigga.  What you going to do?  What the fuck you going to do?  Shit on the floor.  Wipe her ass.  Throw the shit tissue right on the window.  Holy shit. 
[02:37:00]  Motherfucker!  This my mama's watch!  This shit worth more than motherfucking two dollars!  Holy shit.  My mother's more like, she just makes you feel really bad.  You know, she's been through the fucking civil rights, so she just enjoys, especially white  people, if she can talk down to a white person and just make them work harder than they fucking  need to.  My mom is just brutal with that shit.  Yeah.  She doesn't give a shit. 
[02:37:30]  Doesn't give a shit about nothing.  Never gets embarrassed about, I go, and then she'll go, God bless her, she'll be aware  enough to go, you think I'm just being too hard?  I can't stop it.  Nah.  You're like, mom's, you know, sometimes.  You're just getting what you, you know, what's yours.  But she's, she's just, you go, you go, yeah, she can have it now.  But she's never been, motherfucker! 
[02:38:00]  But I, but knowing my mother's always been a black, a big black lady.  Mm-hmm.  There's something about, I think white people, white women, white men find them to be hilarious.  Hilarious.  And white women, white women find them to be, uh, liberating.  Like where the, the, you know, I've seen how white women, when I was younger as a child,  would gravitate towards my mother because black women do shit like, oh, oh, oh, oh, talk 
[02:38:30]  to the hand and all that shit.  They'll be like, oh, yeah.  And, and white women go, that's right, go get them, Bertha.  That's right.  Bertha.  Because black women walk in a room and they're having a meeting, like the, the bosses.  Excuse me.  Excuse me, bosses.  Yeah.  But somebody got my stapler.  I know you, I know the bosses are having a fucking party in here.  And then they'll be like, hey, Bertha, Bertha, they trying to make, they trying to make 
[02:39:00]  us work this Saturday.  What?  Ain't nobody working on no motherfucking Saturday.  You tell them, Bertha.  Get us off on Saturday.  It says here in the bylaws.  Oh, shit.  Section 12.  Code 62.  I ain't working on no motherfucking weekend.  Unless I get double, double time.  Double, double time.  I get double, double time in a half, nigga. 
[02:39:30]  You can't, you can't fire that person.  No, they never get fired.  They never get fired.  I'm not, because downstairs they know me, I've come in enough.  I still have to go to the security.  So wait, we've been here for two straight years.  Let's just walk through at this point.  Well, I don't, I still pull out my wallet, but the girl has my badge ready.  She knows my name at this point.  Right, right.  I still pull my wallet out and my ID, because I don't ever want to get caught out there comfortable  enough to where she go, oh, like where she, the okie doke, where it's like, oh, you comfortable 
[02:40:00]  now.  Yeah.  ID, please.  You know, like, it's like, okay, I know what you're doing.  You're setting me up to be comfortable.  I'm not going to play, every day I pull it out, and she gets frustrated almost that  you see I'm fucking not asking you.  No, good, good.  You're right.  You should do that.  But I don't want you to look at me ever and go and catch me, and then you trick me into  thinking, oh, it's all comfortable. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  It's not, it's not, but there has to be a mentality to hiring, because a lot of those  girls, I go, how do you, how do you, how do you keep this, how does a 400 pound woman  have a job protecting the security of the nation?  Yeah, that I will never understand.  Whose feet hurt.  Yeah.  Who's breathing funny.  It was not going to.  Tits are down to the floor.  Can't walk.  The arms are out.  She's not going to run after anyone.  She's not going to run after anyone. 
[02:41:00]  How is a 400 pound woman, but it's cause they, something about big, those girls, not saying  they're all like that, but some about the ones who are like that, they're so, they're  almost like having the counterpart of having like an Indian work for you, where if I had  a store and I, I would have to have a Hindu person work cause they won't give you a break.  They'll die for, if you try to steal some holes, they'll fucking get shot over that shit. 
[02:41:30]  They'll take a few bullets.  Take a few bullets.  They won't let you even slide for a penny.  And, and it's, and it's, I think, I think big black girls, they just have this thing  where they'll fucking make you, you know, I like where you're going.  All right.  So, uh, a guy comes into a, um, seven 11 to rob it.  Right.  Go through the scenarios.  White guy behind the counter.  What does he do?  Well, you can, you see CCTV.  No, I know.  But let's go.  A white guy who doesn't own a place. 
[02:42:00]  Right.  He puts his hands up.  Right.  And backs away.  Steps back.  He presses the button that opens the fucking thing.  And if he has the security or he has the, the, the, the safe code, he, he gives it to  him.  Oh yeah.  He's not dying over your bullshit.  All right.  Let's go through this quick.  So now you got a female white employee.  What does she do?  She, I've seen CCTV where female white employees panic a little bit, they get a little nervous,  but some might take a swing. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  That's weird.  And they, a lot of times they get knocked out, but that I'll tell you what that is.  It's the same thing.  That'll get a white woman's baby kill in the street.  It's an entitlement thing.  Sometimes white women got to get knocked in the head and they don't think that them  understand their life.  They've never been hit by a guy and can't imagine that this guy, even though he's robbing  the place would hit her.  So she goes for his arm when he's going into the register and this motherfucker will turn  around and cold cock her square in the face. 
[02:43:00]  She's now out of the picture.  She's out of the fucking closed circuit TV picture and the guy just picks the money up  and takes off.  But that's from entitlement.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you got to think the robbers know this.  This is like profile on their, their part.  They know who's behind the counter.  How about a black guy?  Black guy is back.  Matter of fact, if the black guy can get, depending on where he works though, because there's  a lot of bulletproof glass where black guys work.  But if they're going to rob a liquor store and there's no bulletproof glass, black guy 
[02:43:30]  will either do two things.  He will bounce out of the exit because we think about getting murdered.  Just get the fuck out of there.  We don't think about, okay, we don't think about just take the money and leave.  We think about this motherfucker's going to kill me.  Gotcha.  So he's like, yo, yo, all right.  And he's out.  He's not.  And he sprints for the door.  He's trying to leave.  Or he, he might back up and, and, and, and just put his hands up, you know, say, look,  take this shit.  Don't, don't kill me. 
[02:44:00]  You know who the worst are?  We're heading that way.  Hey, I got to say Asians.  Well, we're heading that way.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm on this.  Black woman.  Black woman does the same thing, except for she'll be talking and making sure that this  guy don't, she's, she's, there's a lot of, please don't kill me.  I think black women run out.  They bounce, but they're bouncing backwards.  They're still like checking out the scene.  Like they like, they, they just like, don't kill me.  Don't kill me.  And a black guy puts his head down and bounces for the front door. 
[02:44:30]  And a black guy is, I didn't see your face either.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't see you.  I don't know.  Now then this is honest shit.  If you did this on, uh, I don't know, Fox or MSNBC, they'd be like, are you out of your  mind talking about this?  This is, this is the real deal.  It is what it is.  Do we go Asian or like a Hindu?  Go Asian first because I know Asians.  Which one do you want to do first?  Asian male?  Asian guy will fucking fight with a cat that is running around.  He will pick up the cat that's in his store and throw it at the fucking robber. 
[02:45:00]  He will start fucking thinking everything, thinking an apple is a Chinese star.  He's wailing the fucking guy.  Those motherfuckers.  They will fight.  Those motherfuckers will fight to the death.  To the death.  Not afraid of bullets.  Over 10 bucks.  Not intimidated.  No.  They all think they're Bruce Lee.  They got some action.  It's amazing.  With an umbrella.  Yeah.  With a carton of milk.  Gun shots are going off.  He's grabbing the broom and hitting the guy with a fucking push broom. 
[02:45:30]  Asians are crazy when it comes to store robberies.  And none of these people own the place, by the way.  Well, no, no.  Sometimes the Asians will own it.  The Asians, those are the owners.  See, that's why Hindus, I think, are the most valuable.  Because they'll do it, the same thing, but it ain't even their store.  That's the thing about Hindus.  Asians, it has to be their store.  Asian guy that doesn't own the store, then it could go either way.  Asian guy that doesn't own the store might put his hands up. 
[02:46:00]  I've seen some CCTV where they put their hands up.  So, so far, the only one that owns the store is the Asian male.  Asian male owns the store.  So, then he's going to fight for the death.  He's going to fight to the death for a store.  Fight to the fucking death.  Asian female.  Same thing.  Right with their husband.  Pretty much.  He's crazy.  Right with their husband.  Oh, right with their husband.  And then a couple of cousins run out of the back, and they're whaling them with canned goods.  And then the robber's like, ah, motherfucking runs out of the place.  Let me put one little footnote.  Not all white people.  White, Eastern Europeans, Poland, Russia, they'll get into an actual gunfight. 
[02:46:30]  They'll throw down.  Yeah.  No one's stealing from a fucking Russian store.  They'll throw down.  And Russians will pull a gun out.  And they're excited to be in a gunfight.  You want to make sure you hear the voice before you.  Yeah, they were waiting for the day.  May I help you.  And the wife or the daughter will be cursing and spitting as their fucking uncles and brothers are.  You want money from register? 
[02:47:00]  Look, please don't kill me.  I will get the money from the safe down here.  Pulls out a giant old fucking Soviet gun and just starts wailing shots off at this brother, who's now crouched behind the Doritos, fucking shooting back.  I love those clips.  The Doritos are exploding.  They're exploding.  Did they turn the heat on in here?  It feels hot, right?  Did they turn the heat?  I swear.  It just got hot.  It does feel hot in here.  I just felt hot heat.  It happened in here, too.  I think the air conditioning all went out. 
[02:47:30]  Well, open the door or something.  Holy shit balls.  We gotta go home.  We can't fucking do this.  It just got fucking...  Hey, can you do this in the heat?  I can't do this in the heat.  We better go home.  I smell heat.  It just came out like, not only did the air conditioning went off, the heat went on.  Yeah.  The heat's blowing.  Yeah.  Russians are scary, man, in general.  Seeing more and more Russians in New York City, too.  Don't care.  Russians are crazy.  It's all hell.  The one thing you get, you did give Italian mafia.  Yeah.  The people, I don't know why Italian people hate the mafia image, but there was a time 
[02:48:00]  where, you know, you, the respect level, because they only, it was some kind of men of respect.  It was a code.  A huge code.  They were committing crimes.  Yeah, yeah.  But they weren't doing a home invasion on some poor motherfucker.  Russians, man, that whole women and children...  Oh, man.  Don't care.  They'll fucking juggle baby heads, man.  They don't, they don't fuck around.  If somebody fucked them over, the whole family goes. 
[02:48:30]  Extended.  Those Russian mob, those mobsters, man, those Russian guys, the Eastern European...  Crazy.  And basically, like the basic Eastern European people, they're really hard.  And, and, and like, you know, this is, this is, uh, like kind of old, an old thing, but  whoever the best fighters are at the time right now, those are the most oppressed and  most brutal people, most fucking Eastern Europeans, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Right now, they the, they the baddest motherfuckers fucking they are, man. 
[02:49:00]  They're pretty badass.  That's good, Al.  Al was in, Al was in jail, wants to tell us how the black, uh, women's security guards  treated him.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  You want to guess?  How they treated him?  Yeah.  Hold on, Al.  Patrice is really, uh, I would, I would say, uh, black security guard women in a jail,  if you didn't disrespect them, they were probably very, very sweet.  Very sweet.  Oh, no.  No.  They treated you like shit?  It was a nightmare.  Oh, yeah.  But how did you treat them, though, sir? 
[02:49:30]  How'd you treat them?  I treated them, I was very nice.  I said, uh, ma'am, can I please, uh, have you in favor and can you relay a message to my  wife?  Because my wife was waiting for me in the, uh, other side of the building there.  For me to get up.  And they're like, what do you think we, uh, Western Union messengers?  I don't know.  Come on.  That is them, though.  That's them.  That's them, though, man.  I think I'd go to the Western Union.  I know motherfucking Western Union. 
[02:50:00]  I feel like I know a lady like that.  Oh, shit.  Black women are so, why are they so war-like?  Yeah.  I'm telling you, man.  They like to fight.  You know what the fucked up thing, too, is those rotund black women do get a lot of positions  of power, like that, uh, the ticket agents out on the street, uh, TSA, um, uh, DMV, like 
[02:50:30]  all these places where you need these people to help you.  That's where you encounter a lot of these women, and that's where you get most of the problems.  Because I don't, I, people who hire people are not dumb.  Yeah.  Like, I was driving yesterday and saw, I don't want to get in trouble, but listen, uh, I saw  a two-lady police officer's team in a, in a, in a cruiser.  Yeah.  Two girls. 
[02:51:00]  Were they lezzing out?  Just trying, just, no, driving through the cities, keeping it safe.  And I just, my immediate, my immediate thing is to laugh.  And almost to do something so they stop me and just.  And go, really?  And just get, go through the arrest thing, just to say, ah, could you arrest me?  Like, what are you doing?  And just sit in the back, I just thought of Daydream World, sitting in the back, just  going, really?  Like, like, like, I think they hire people who would get no respect otherwise. 
[02:51:30]  Like, like, why not hire every cop to be like Kenny?  Yeah.  Like, meaning somebody who could arrest you if they wasn't a cop.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, I'm like, I think they put in people who are very, and guys too, not just ladies.  There are some guys who are cops.  You just start, you're just going to go.  Yeah.  And you go, you know, the only reason that we're talking right now is because I respect  the actual law.  Like, actually, I can fucking, I can fucking be arrested by a computer because I respect 
[02:52:00]  the law.  Uh-huh.  I wouldn't want the law coming down on me.  Right.  But, but, but you.  But you're going to do this, really?  Like, you're just, you're just a mess.  And you want to laugh at them.  Yeah.  But you go, I respect the law, you know?  I'll take it.  Kenny's got a little pert here.  Well, some departments don't have physical fitness standards.  Oh, you could tell.  Yeah.  You could tell.  Like, back in the day, like, you know, we, we had to take a, you know, a, a physical 
[02:52:30]  test where you had to get over a six foot wall.  And why'd they stop doing that?  Well, because you have to have a very cultural, diverse.  But what does that have to do with being fat?  Hey, we got to put fat bitches on the floor.  Fat bitches had to be on the floor.  With their pants pulled all the way up.  Under their tits.  I love that look.  Yeah.  Walking around.  Fucking ass in the front.  Ass in the front.  The front ass.  You fucking messy bitch. 
[02:53:00]  Ah, front ass.  I think it's disrespectful, kid.  Because it's like, okay, I see you in the street.  Disrespect's the uniform.  Because you get respect even when you're not in uniform.  See, that's what I'm saying.  They need police that, that can, that have, understands getting respect from other people  and giving respect.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And how to, how to exchange.  But when you get some little broad and she's standing in and, and she's just wearing too  much heavy clothing.  Yeah.  You see the belt is too heavy and the gun is too heavy. 
[02:53:30]  Her head is big.  She's going to fucking be an asshole because she's already coming in with that defensive  disadvantage.  That thing.  So she's got to make up for it somehow.  Well, you know, she, you know, you know, she don't respect.  So all, but really all she needs to go is to go, look, um, basically I'm the law.  Did you ever see that, that CC clip of the police, the, the black guy saying, baby, get  in the car, telling his daughter, baby, get in the car.  Oh shit.  And the fucking woman cop is like, I'm a woman cop. 
[02:54:00]  And the guy punches her once.  Punches her in the face.  Shatters her entire girl face.  And it's like, come at people knowing who we know who you are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But what you are is you're not able to deal with some fucking, uh, frantic, big black.  Some people are not going to just respect the uniform and the law.  It doesn't, it doesn't matter.  Punch your girl face in.  So you get, you get these, these, these really bad, uh, security guards, these really bad, 
[02:54:30]  uh, uh, meter maids.  They, I think they hire people who never had respect before because they won't let you slide.  They won't, they, they're so happy hovering over you and controlling you.  Yeah.  That if I, if I was a cop, a lot of motherfuckers would be getting away with shit.  Yeah.  Like I would stop a dude and somebody and they go, Oh, some girl's like, I think just  like, I think everybody who commits a crime shouldn't go to jail. 
[02:55:00]  Right.  Cause jail is there for to, to, to penance.  So you go to jail and you go, you know, I didn't, I really didn't mean to hit you with  the car.  And it's like, you know what?  I think you will never do it again.  I'm not sending you to fucking jail.  You don't need to be in jail.  Just cause of the statute.  I'm sitting, I'll send you to jail if I think you should be off the streets, but there's  some people that commit crimes that shouldn't be off the fucking streets.  They'll never do anything again.  Never. 
[02:55:30]  So if I was a cop, because I've been big my whole life.  So I understand certain kind of respect.  You pull over somebody that's horrified.  Their fucking light is out.  They're fucking, you know, they got tents or whatever.  Everybody got tents out.  Well, when I look down, what are you doing?  They answer a couple of good questions.  I'm like, go ahead.  Your license is suspended.  Get it unsuspended.  Just fucking, like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't fucking be lawly with everybody. 
[02:56:00]  Why?  But those, the whack motherfuckers, that's, cause, okay, you get, you get some little girl  that goes in the police force, bunch of, bunch of 30 and 40 old dudes sitting there  like, hey dudes, all right, got your cuffs.  She's going to try to overly prove that she belongs on the, I don't trust any woman that  wants to be a cop.  Why the fuck do you want to be a cop?  Why the fuck do you want to fight in a war, bitch?  They got everybody confused. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Stay home.  I don't, I don't get the whole female cop thing.  Whenever I watch some of these shows and see one female cop up against one big fucking  perp and, and she isn't just immediately holding him at gunpoint with her fucking radio  going, please send some men out here.  Because there's no way I'm taking this motherfucking down.  Female bounty hunters?  Kenny's laughing at that.  Kenny, you got anything on that?  He can't say nothing, but Kenny knows.  Oh, he can say a thing or two. 
[02:57:00]  He can say like, he's heard, but he's heard stories of, of the past.  Well, he watches a lot of police movies and police shows.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of old school guys, like I saw in a movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That are of, of the opinion, you know, they should like stay home and be barefoot and  pregnant.  Right.  Right.  Or at least barefoot.  Yeah.  You know, in today's modern day policing society, there is very limited, you know, use for 
[02:57:30]  women resources.  Right.  In policing.  In policing.  Because it's a police state of mind.  It's like you can hire any, you don't need to hire the elite because it's a police state.  It's a police, it's a mental control.  Right.  So all you have to do is have somebody in a uniform, but, but see, my thing I learned  early in life, I like, there's a certain way to talk to police.  Police hate when you think, you know, the law, because there's a thing that police have 
[02:58:00]  that cancels everything.  People don't know that.  When I grew up used to be like a lot of motherfuckers read books and went to jail, read books and be  like, Keith Robinson.  I have the, I know, motherfucker.  I know that shit, motherfucker.  I, if I, the law states, if I'm standing 10 feet away from you, I am allowed.  It's like, police have a thing called fucking, uh, uh, uh, disorderly.  Disorderly conduct.  Disorderly is purely what I say goes. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  It, that, it ends all your shit.  You are being disorderly.  I can arrest you.  Oh, you're going to get out and you're not going to pay a fine.  The charges will be dropped, but you will go through the hassle of me cuffing you.  It's a police, uh, uh, it's a police cancel all disorderly is like this funny word that  we kind of think like disorderly conduct thinks you, you, you, you're raising hell.  No, no, it's your district.  It could be anything.  If a cop says this and you don't do it, disorderly, that's disorderly. 
[02:59:00]  That's tumultuous behavior.  They, they have a loophole because a guy cops this, it is really, you want to challenge cops  sometimes, sometimes you got to be willing, maybe, okay, there's a battle.  I'm a fight.  I was at Newark during Christmas time, picking my mom's up during Christmas time and it gets  busy.  They put a cop out there, you know, wave, you know, and I go, you know, sir, I'm trying  to pick my mom's up this way.  And I just go, cool.  But I'm like, did you realize like you're not, cause I said, so is not a, or like, it's 
[02:59:30]  not good enough.  You gotta, you gotta be more respectful of the, of the entire idea of people where you  just go, cause I said so.  Yeah.  That means that you're the law, like judge dread and not that you're following the law.  You are the law, but you're not the law.  But I don't like to get into those crazy things like they're going to beat my head in, but  I'm just going, come on, man, be more respectful.  Can't you also get them on an obstruction? 
[03:00:00]  Like if they're just the interfering, you see that, you see that smirk?  I know if someone's like videotaping something that brought back a nice memory for Kenny  or they're yelling shit out, but you know, you don't want to get them on a disorderly or  maybe can't, can you get an obstruction?  That's another sham arrest.  Oh, it is.  Yeah.  Whenever you see like disorderly conduct obstructing and resisting arrest, you know, that guy's 
[03:00:30]  just paying a stupid tax.  Hey.  A stupid tax.  It is what it is.  It's just like you can't get past it, but that's just so wrong, man.  I got NYPD checking in on Twitter.  I'm a NYPD and a couple of years ago, NYPD hired two female midgets.  True story.  I swear to God.  Have you heard of that one?  If I saw a female midget cop, first of all, I'd laugh my balls off just thinking it was  a gag.  And then if I was a guy that might be apt to commit crimes, I would not let that person 
[03:01:00]  arrest me.  Not even a fucker.  I'll tell you this.  I'll tell you this.  I'll tell you this, right?  It's been my experience on the street.  Like if a few cops show up on a call and there's some kind of incident and I was usually  the biggest guy there, the shittin' would always come at me and give me a hard time  figuring if he can back down the biggest guy, everybody else is going to fall in line.  Oh, shit.  So you were the marked man.  Yeah.  Kenny knew how, on a natural level, as a big man, Kenny already knows how to defuse problems. 
[03:01:30]  And something tells me Kenny wasn't the guy that would get out and go, excuse me, sir,  if there was a volatile situation, you would use body language and your voice and everything  to make sure that person knows you're in fucking charge.  No, if I pulled up to a volatile situation, the first thing I would do is turn on the  sirens and give them a chance to run. 
[03:02:00]  Fuck it.  You didn't want to do too much.  I've heard a lot of stories from Kenny over the years and Kenny, without giving too much  away, he's been in situations where the guy was just as big as Kenny, if not bigger.  And Kenny sort of had a problem trying to control the situation.  And look how big he is.  He's 6'5".  He's a monster.  Oh, there's some big bad guys.  So how is a female midget in this case going to handle these situations?  You're just going to put another cop in danger. 
[03:02:30]  She's doubly useless.  Well, that one where the guy punched that woman in the face, she fell down and you couldn't  see the dash cam anymore because she was in front of the car.  He got over her and kept beating the fuck out of her face.  UFC this bitch, man.  Just beat the fuck out of her face.  And then to prove her fucking gun hole, she's working again.  Yeah, yeah.  With steel blades in her face.  She got fucking nuts and balls, really?  Reconstructed eye sockets.  Oh, yeah.  It's like, miss, just now be a mom. 
[03:03:00]  Didn't the guy take her gun, too?  No, no, no.  But he's in jail for the rest of his life, that guy.  Oh, yes.  He said, baby, he gets his daughter.  Oh, no.  Oh, he clocks her.  His daughter goes, daddy.  Daddy.  It's a sad video.  Get in the car, baby.  And he goes, oh, go, baby.  We're in the car.  And he just proceeds to beat the shit.  This is it.  Yeah, this is it.  She got her face smashed in.  Look at that.  Every bone broken, reconstructive surgery.  The fuck?  Blasted her, man.  Out of her face.  And that's his daughter? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Get in the car, baby.  Get in the car, baby.  Go ahead, gal.  Go ahead now.  He beat.  And he got that, look what you made me do, lady.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like, oh, man.  You had to make me beat your fucking face in.  He went to jail forever.  Oh, man.  And the daughter's just like, oh, great.  To not be a complete misogynist, would that have happened?  You think that would have happened to you?  That situation?  Like, the brutality of it? 
[03:04:00]  I mean, you know, it's hard to second guess.  You know, when you're out there in the highway all by yourself, that's a bad situation.  But if it was a male as opposed to a female cop, the shit might have thought twice.  Yeah.  And I'm going to tell you why, okay?  Not to say that she's not a good cop.  Because I'm saying that as a dude, there's nothing to...  See, she's coming up as a cop.  Yeah.  As a man cop, you're coming up as a dude going, this big motherfucker, you're already thinking 
[03:04:30]  of consequence.  She's right in his face.  She's got her cuffs out.  He turns around.  Look, she got caught so fucking...  She never thought he was going to do that.  That she thought everything about her was cop.  The second he turned around, and he didn't turn around with a punch.  He turned around first, looked at her.  At that point, she should have gotten a lot more defensive and backed off.  She stood there holding her cuffs like a dummy, thinking that's going to fucking do something. 
[03:05:00]  And he, that big meaty fist, right into her face.  Because you're a dude, and I'm not saying that couldn't happen, but most of the time,  if you're a fucking dude, and a big dude, and you see that motherfucker, you're telling  him everything you need to do from where you are.  Look.  It's like, stand in front of the car.  Because you're thinking like, if you was just two people at the car, like...  Put your hands on the car, this is for both of our protection.  Like, motherfuckers, stay right there. 
[03:05:30]  Got any weapons on you?  You got any fucking...  But she was being mislawed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You think she was also thinking that he would never hit a woman?  No.  It was like...  He would never...  Yes.  He would never hit a woman.  She had that...  And he would never hit a cop.  And the kid being there threw her off guard, too.  She probably thought, what's he going to do?  His daughter's right.  Her body language was saying, there's no way this...  60.  Fuck you.  Her body language was saying, there's no way this guy's going to hit me.  No.  She didn't even think that was a possibility.  She let him over.  And at any time, that guy could have turned around and punched her. 
[03:06:00]  Of course.  And he did.  Of course.  But that's what I'm saying.  You need elite physical specimens.  Yeah.  Like, when I see that big stormtrooper pull you over in his fucking tight shirt, and his  tight walk, and his boots, you go...  You go, you know...  You're like, oh, fuck.  You know what, sir?  And you would, and nine times out of ten, if you got a decent excuse, and you're not  breaking a law, and you're complying, anytime I didn't get a ticket from a statey, it was 
[03:06:30]  a big dude who was like, eh, and he probably met his first of the month ticket quota.  Right.  And he's just like, go ahead.  Anytime you get one, it's an old nonsense guy, some old dude that's just like, man, what  an asshole, and then, or some woman is like, why is she doing this?  But the big stateys, when you think of a big statey, you just think of a motherfucker that  can tip your car over by himself.  Get that hat over that crew cut. 
[03:07:00]  A by-himself guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You need that.  You can't have like this little old lady, or this middle-aged woman, thinking it's all  about fucking...  That's what I'm saying.  When I drive through the Holland Tunnel, I'm looking at this...  I'm calling this little girl...  She ain't doing shit.  And I just want to pull over and talk to her, and not get arrested, just...  Good job at Macy's.  Not only are you a girl, you're really a girl.  Yeah.  You're a super girl.  Like, what are you going to do if I don't give a fuck? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  I don't want to punch your face in like that.  What are you going to do if I don't give a fuck?  Like, that's just so...  That's so weird to me.  And it's so disrespectful to put a person, not in his position, but he got 60 years for...  And you saw when he stood over, he's looking like...  Oh, boy.  He already looked at...  What the fuck did I do?  He looked like, oh, boy.  I had...  Oh, man.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  And his daughter's fucked up now.  Now she's a woman's rights activist.  Oh, shit.  You know, fucking because she's seen daddy do that shit.  Beat the fuck out of some woman. 
[03:08:00]  So if she's ever with a man that tickles, then she's going to stab him and mace him.  Fucking she's all fucked up now.  And she's all fucked up.  But I mean, I'm not out of bounds, Kenny.  I don't think...  Nah, I think a lot of people think your way.  Kenny, anything to answer this?  It's an unfortunate situation.  It is unfortunate.  I mean, the midget thing is taking a little too far on the police force.  Wait, whoa.  Little person.  Somebody texted me that little thing.  Oh, wait a minute.  The midget cop ended up getting fired because she was a lesbian and called other people lesbians 
[03:08:30]  on a domestic call.  Wait, that's a real...  That's a real...  Yeah, well...  Hey, you lesbian.  Like, I need this shit.  I'm a cop.  Freeze, motherfucker.  We need little juicy-ass cops.  Little fucking round butts.  With those giant asses and short little legs.  Little arms.  Wouldn't you just pick up the midget and run away with her?  Oh, man.  If you're in a situation, you'd grab her and run away.  Her little size half boot.  They gotta get a special made police boot.  Throw her in a garbage pail and you keep running. 
[03:09:00]  They gotta get a modified baby shoe to be a fucking...  Her little stormtrooper boots painted black.  So, the midget...  The midget lesbian cop went on a domestic call with some other lesbians and the midget lesbian  cop started calling the other one and asking for a date and that's why she got fired.  Oh, shit.  And you know that they were so good.  They were like, thank God.  Yeah, we finally got a way to...  What a fucking mockery.  We figured out a way to get out of this.  I think a big, fat-ass, asshole Jamaican bitch, fucking car person, meter maid, is a fuck... 
[03:09:30]  It's an embarrassment.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they're there for some kind of weird...  There is a reason.  And they're so cold.  You're not supposed to be fucking cold.  They don't look at you when you talk to them.  They're just like...  Oh, miss, I just went in the store for a second.  Move your car.  Yeah.  Move it.  I'm all good. 
[03:10:00]  I already started.  You're like, fuck you, man.  And you know what?  I was hoping no one was going to bring this up, but we did have female cops come in when  we were working at NEW.  I want to stay for the record.  I was out of shape that day.  No, let me also tell you something else.  We wanted to see how fast they could cuff us.  I think that video's online.  And they cuff us very quickly.  But all we were able to do was resist physically trying to do this.  If I was allowed to punch her in the fucking face...  As hard as I could, there could have been a problem. 
[03:10:30]  So what did she do?  She might have choked the shit out of me.  I don't know.  On the average resistance.  They were very good at tying me up and cuffing me.  So what did you try to do?  Like, did you...  I tried to...  Yeah.  I tried to worm my way around.  I tried to hold her arm back.  We were trying to...  What did she do?  I tried to keep my arm...  She got a fucking, you know, arm in there.  Bent it.  Bent my arm back.  And it was two on one, if you remember.  She was well trained.  Two girls on one.  The whole gig was, could we get out of the studio?  So it was like, and go.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So we had to get out of the studio. 
[03:11:00]  And they grabbed us.  And, you know, we fought like hell.  But...  Steve Carlisi didn't get out?  No.  And it was just me and Ann, I think.  It was just you and Ann?  I think.  And Rick.  Oh, yeah.  And you know what?  Basic...  Look, I know it's not like they're hiring fucking Martha Stewart.  But that's me.  And that's Opie.  And that's Rick.  It's not some big motherfucker who is out for blood that would punch your face in.  Even little guys.  Guys don't want to get locked up, man.  They put up a fight sometimes. 
[03:11:30]  It's hard to get people cuffed.  Once the adrenaline's going, maybe they're a little sweaty, you can't grab them.  Oh, man.  All I'm saying is I was impressed that day.  I didn't even think they were going to be able to cuff us.  That's how laughable we thought they were.  But I think a lot of it, you know, like they say, look, I saw a lockup on...  Oh, man.  What channel?  Discovery?  Yeah, I love that show.  Well, I've seen one.  It was...  No, it was MSNBC.  Yeah, MSNBC does lockup on the weekend.  It was international lockup.  Oh, shit. 
[03:12:00]  And the jail in fucking Chechnya.  Oh, fuck.  It was a state-of-art jail.  It was a state-of-art jail.  Yes.  But the guards didn't have sticks.  They didn't have tasers.  They didn't have cuffs.  And the prisoners weren't cuffed as they were taking them back and forth because the guards  were all UFC fighters.  Yeah.  Not literally, but they were elite motherfuckers, man, that are breaking your face. 
[03:12:30]  And they knew there was not going to be a lawsuit if he elbowed the guy's face in.  Dude, and you could just...  The serenity and the non-violence because of the fact that you...  You didn't want to deal with that shit.  These guys weren't fucking around.  They would kill you and it wouldn't matter.  It'd be two of them.  When someone's being escorted through the hallways, it was always two of them. 
[03:13:00]  And they were all young...  Just jacked.  Those bad motherfuckers, those Eastern European ex-soccer hooligans that were trained to fight.  To fight.  And you allow one person down the hall at a time.  And then when you're in the yard, everybody gets to...  And all the cops are there making sure everybody's playing nice.  But there's no fucking...  They don't have the weapons.  They don't have...  It's just their little uniforms.  Their little McDonald's uniforms.  And they just are escorting other big dudes down the hall. 
[03:13:30]  But they know they're elite.  Because they know what's going to happen to them if they fuck around.  When I see a stormtrooper coming at me on 95, you're at your best behavior on a lot of levels.  Gotta be.  Now, I respect the law.  So if I saw a fucking woman midget, I'm not going to laugh in her face.  You're still going to be.  But I'm going to go, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I'm just going to go, if I didn't respect the law, I'd just kick this...  I'll kick you.  I'll bowl you right now.  I'd open the door and just knock her the fuck down right in the face with the door handle. 
[03:14:00]  Just to get the legend of the laugh I would get.  I'll take the 10 years.  But I respect the law.  I don't want the law down on me.  Because I know it's huge.  It can't be stopped.  But at the end of the day, you know, you go, oh, man.  Look at this fucking guy's giant head and his fucking seriousness.  And you go, dude, what was I doing?  60?  And then the one guy let me go because I said this.  He goes, you were speeding. 
[03:14:30]  I go, sir, I was in the middle of the pack.  I know I was speeding, but I was going with everybody else.  How'd you pick me out of here?  And it's just like, well, you know.  And I go, oh, come on.  I was a little charming.  The dude was like, yeah.  I go, come on.  What is it?  Because my truck is giant and red.  He laughed as much as a state trooper could laugh.  But he was like, all right, just, you know.  And it's like, all right, I said this.  You know, I can't imagine if I was trying to do that to a woman. 
[03:15:00]  And she's like, oh, you're trying to charm me?  No.  You're not.  What do you think?  Because I'm a girl, you can just tickle your way out of a ticket?  Stay here.  Stay here in the vehicle.  I'll be back.  Yeah, it's just because she's not used to.  Get it.  It was a girl in Florida.  They brought the cops in to escort this old drunk lady.  She was belligerent.  They came to get her out.  And I go, Jesus Christ, look at this cop.  She's delicious.  And she looked at me with cop face.  I go, give me a fucking break, miss. 
[03:15:30]  You're blonde and sexy.  You look like the Swiss Miss Coco girl.  I'm fucking, I'm going to jerk off to you in the prison when you arrest me.  Like, just fucking with her.  They were laughing.  But she, but it's always got to be, you are going to respect me.  But a big dude, somebody fucks with Kenny in the audience, he's going to laugh.  Because he's, it's not digging to the, to the.  You know he's going to have control of the situation.  Without a doubt in your mind.  Control the whole fucking situation.  I'm not trashing women cops. 
[03:16:00]  I'm just, I guess I am.  But it's like.  But there's a problem there.  There's an inherent problem there.  Well, come on, man.  Man, you got the, just like skinnier guys, cops and everything.  It's going to be a problem.  You got cops calling and they're all like, thank you, Patrice.  Because they can't, they can't say this stuff.  They're all in agreement.  I don't have one.  And it's just, it's just, it's just based on being a person who knows how to handle yourself without the permission of the justice system. 
[03:16:30]  Right, right.  We got, this is a good story coming in from Boston.  Anthony, go ahead, buddy.  Well, I was sitting here.  So, basically, my cousin is a big state trooper.  He's about 6'3".  He works down on the beach a lot where there's a lot of bars.  And he's got this new partner.  I guess they changed the rules.  You don't have to be 6'0".  He's about 5'2".  He calls him Frodo.  And this guy used to work down on the beach, you know, like I said.  And I guess he was working at night. 
[03:17:00]  And these drunk kids just have no respect.  One time just started rubbing his head and telling him how cute he was because he was so small and dressed up in his little uniform.  Oh.  That's just not right.  You got to have physical, physically elite people to fucking control your life.  I knew one of these would come in.  We got a retired cop, so he has nothing to lose.  Keith in Missouri, go ahead, sir.  You're right.  I ain't got nothing to lose. 
[03:17:30]  There are exceptions.  I have worked with some good women.  But the majority of female police officers have got some type of massive inferiority complex.  And they're either, like, ultra, ultra aggressive or they think they can fix the world by love.  By love.  Let me, what take, other than physically, being physical presence, what does it really take to be a really, really great cop? 
[03:18:00]  Common sense.  That's the bottom line.  Doesn't matter how many book smarts and book knowledge you have, you need common sense.  Right, right, right.  All right.  Anything else, Missouri Keith there?  Well, I want to say I love Kenny, because every time the man talks, it's something that I want to say.  Yeah.  Kenny went through the war.  He saw it all. 
[03:18:30]  We had an old saying.  We had an old saying when we were going to go to a fight.  Take your time.  You take the winner to jail and the loser to the hospital.  That's right, sir.  That's right, sir.  Which is basically, it's the truth.  Yeah.  If you got eyes, it's like, you fucking, you know how that's going to happen?  And the loser to the hospital.  Cops ain't shit, man.  Okay, here we go.  Cops are just dudes.  It's just like, what are you going to do? 
[03:19:00]  They really are.  Bob in Ohio.  Bob.  Listen, I was on the force with a female officer, and she was not only black, but I'm 6'3", 245 pounds,  and she had an attitude three times my size, and she was just a ton and a half, and there's  no nice way to say it.  I couldn't wait until the day she got fired.  She actually got fired for assault charges.  Of course.  Of course. 
[03:19:30]  Assault.  Pull over, motherfucker.  When I say pull over, what?  You pull over.  Oh, can you give me a little bit of insight on this, Kenny?  These new, unmarked police cars that are pulling you over, that have lights that you can get  at your local unregistered Puerto Rican alarm shop.  They'll put them on.  Yes.  Can I drive somewhere to where I think it's very safe in case this guy's a criminal with 
[03:20:00]  those lights on?  Like, if it's a real cop.  Wait, what are they using?  It doesn't look like a cop car?  No, dude, they're in fucking Escalades.  They're in fucking Camaros.  Yeah, I've seen that, yeah.  Regular cars, and they have the flashing lights, but you can put those on yourself, and they  flash you, but I'm saying, it's not even like the police thing where they pull it out  the top and put the cone on the top.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the whole thing, you know.  The light package, yeah.  So, I'm wondering if you can, even if he's a cop, would they go, look, man, I drove another 
[03:20:30]  extra five miles just because I thought you might have been trying to rob me.  And, you know, I mean, is that legal to do?  Well, that could be your affirmative defense in court.  Fair enough.  Fair enough for running.  Yeah, because, you know, there are a lot of undercover cars with these fancy fucking  lights now, but, and, you know, especially women are scared, you know, because women  get pulled over and sexually assaulted or whatever. 
[03:21:00]  I would at least, if it's at all possible, and I've done this before just for the safety  factor of me and the cop, because I've been pulled over on the expressway where there's  no shoulder or anything, and I've put my hazards on, put my hand out the window, giving  a wave like I acknowledge that you're pulling me over, but I'll slowly find a good spot  to, uh, to stop.  And sometimes that's getting off the highway and pulling into a parking lot under a fucking 
[03:21:30]  light at night.  I'll make sure, like, make them totally comfortable.  You know, I'll put both hands on the wheel, uh, window down and, and dome light on.  Uh, but, but I let them know I'm not, you know, I see you.  Right.  I just want to make sure we're both in a safe place.  Right.  And I think they understand that.  I mean, if you fucking, if you just, you take off from them, uh, there's going to be  a problem.  And it's not fucking, uh, uh, uh, uh, you know, the Dodge Intrepid's is shit.  It's, it's, it's. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They got Bentleys now or something like that.  I think they, you know, the drug dealer cars, they're just making it into police cars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If, if you're in an isolated area and you think you're going to get jacked, I think you could  pull to a more populated place and well-lit place.  There's always like some gas station or just something is somewhere in front of a security  camera.  It's just anything, you know, anything.  I'm like, I'm pulling over for this fucking guy in a cab.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And yeah.  And kind of look at him as he's walking up to you.  See what it's fucking got in his hand. 
[03:22:30]  What are you doing?  I'm going home.  Yeah.  So am I.  Really?  Yeah.  It's 10 o'clock.  Goodbye.  You could do the, uh, the next hour if you want.  Don't force me to do that now.  Don't force me.  Don't force me to do it.  But I'm just saying.  Sam ain't here.  What the fuck is that?  No one's got to do it.  Just throw a tape in.  I'm actually going to play golf in this heat, which is kind of stupid.  Golf?  Without the L.  Can I plug something?  Please.  I'm just going, uh, the Treehouse Comedy Club in Stamford, Connecticut, and then Sag  Harbor.  I mean, it can't be that many places that Patrice O'Neill would be in Sag Harbor. 
[03:23:00]  So I'm going to be in Sag Harbor in the tip of Long Island.  Yes.  How could it be a two hour drive anywhere from New York to New York that really bugs me?  Unless I'm going upstate.  It's crazy.  Way the fuck out there.  Thank God you're going on a Monday.  Less traffic.  Yeah.  Okay.  So I'm going to be there.  It's a nightmare to get out there.  Sag Harbor.  And then on, uh, next week, uh, the 29th, 30th, 31st of, uh, this month is my triumphant  return to Phoenix.  Haven't been there since 99. 
[03:23:30]  Damn.  Wow.  The last episode of Seinfeld.  I was in fucking-  Holy shit.  12 years.  I was, uh, yeah.  That is a long ass time ago.  Long time ago.  And Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  And, uh-  That's it.  Yeah.  And Patrice will not be part of this channel anytime soon.  We learned that very early on in the show today.  Don't say that.  It's possible.  It's possible.  I have hope.  I do have hope.  I saw numbers going back and forth.  According to you.  It's an old dream.  Wow.  That's a gap.  That's like a Grand Canyon type of gap that they got to close. 
[03:24:00]  Yes.  No hope.  Hope lies here.  Yeah.  Bring the, bring the tombstone.  There is no hope.  Patrice.  It's always a pleasure.  Big Mama Prods on Twitter, of course.  All right, guys.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  All right, guys.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The virus. </pre>
