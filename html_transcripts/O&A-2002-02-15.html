<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with humorous commentary on oversized Valentine's Day cards and segued into a bizarre news roundup featuring a man sending his severed finger to his ex-girlfriend and another repeatedly running over pedestrians.  Listener calls followed, highlighting Jim Norton's successful Philadelphia show and sparking a discussion about his tour ticket sales.  A segment comparing AOL's limitations to other internet providers was also included.  A new segment was proposed: a contest to find the "biggest freak" in each city's news, using Boston and New York as initial examples.  Further calls detailed a supermarket assault over shopping cart limits, a discovered severed penis, and a caller's explicit phone sex performance.  A lengthy comedic skit, "Dice on Ice," featuring a flamboyant figure skater, was performed, intertwined with Olympic figure skating commentary focusing on the judging controversy and Timothy Goebel's performance.  A studio guest, the unnamed "Headstand Yellow Disciplined Girl," was present, though not actively involved in this part.  Mario Cantone was mentioned as a scheduled guest.

The show continued with anticipation for a female caller, "Kelly," for the "55-gallon drum challenge," which she ultimately missed.  This led to an offensive rant against the British, followed by a news story about a man triggered by specific words (including "New Jersey," "Wisconsin," and "Snickers").  The hosts described the 55-gallon drum challenge in detail, highlighting its unpleasant nature.  Jim Norton's upcoming shows were heavily promoted, despite poorly produced ads claiming he performed "songs and antics," a fact he denied.  Numerous calls ensued, including an impersonation of Ozzy Osbourne and the recurring "Bang bang" bit.  A playback of a call informing a woman of her friend "Bill's" death generated humorous distress. Discussions about Britney Spears and her film, and another lengthy, offensive tirade against the French referencing WWII and stereotypes were interspersed.  Further promotion of "Dice on Ice" and Mario Cantone's presence were noted.  Rich Voss, a comedian calling from England, added to the anti-British sentiment.  Mario Cantone remained a recurring guest throughout this segment.

The next segment contrasted the hosts' perceived toughness in Harlem against the perceived threat of North London.  Numerous calls followed, including bizarre claims and accents, and contributions to the "F.U. line" segment.  A significant call with Vince McMahon ensued, discussing WWF events, including Hulk Hogan's return, Stephanie McMahon's wardrobe malfunctions, and upcoming storylines, all laced with profanity and sexually suggestive remarks about Stephanie McMahon.  Mario Cantone joined in studio.  The hosts offered profane opinions on Oscar nominees and films.  "Dice on Ice" was again previewed and later performed with crude humor and homophobic slurs.  The 55-gallon drum challenge was promoted again, with callers expressing interest in participating.  The segment concluded with more "Dice on Ice" discussion and "F.U. line" messages.

The final segment featured a sexually charged and vulgar conversation with Mario Cantone in studio, focusing on his reluctance to leave his house.  A woman promoting a band was subjected to sexually explicit comments and requests to show her breasts, which she ultimately did, eliciting graphic descriptions.  Homophobic and sexually suggestive remarks were prevalent, with the phrase "get the soap out" recurring in a sexual context.  Listener calls and jokes were interspersed.  The segment promoted Mario Cantone's upcoming shows, the "Naughty Nighty Contest," and the 55-gallon drum challenge, again emphasizing female participation.  The closing moments promoted a hotel and the show itself.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  How are you guys doing?  Doing good, Tom. Thank you.  Thanks for asking, Tom.  God damn!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  I love you guys. I feel like I've known you forever. 
[00:00:30]  I bring an ice chest everywhere.  Hey, everybody! We're all going to get laid!  Wham!  Wham!  Wham!  Oh, man.  Everyone have a good Valentine's Day with your sweeties.  It was lovely, Anthony.  Was it?  Everyone enjoyed their car? 
[00:01:00]  I used to work for the former.  Classic rock station.  Very good to hear that, Tom.  Tom, we're trying to do a show. Thank you.  Yeah, it's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Buffalo!  Tickets went on sale for Jim Norton's show in Buffalo.  You could use the following number if you're outside of New York, including Buffalo today. 
[00:01:30]  866-277-4-WOW.  That's 866-277-4-WOW.  Wow.  Yeah, Valentine's Day was all right.  Yeah, everyone enjoyed their cards.  It was 866-277-4-WOW.  Did you get a good card, Opie?  Or did you get one of the big ones that you were making fun of?  No, we discussed this yesterday.  No, I know, but did Sandy get you a good card?  Because I was thinking, you're making fun of the big card, and if Sandy had gotten you a big card, there was going to be a problem there.  Uh, no, I got my Valentine's Day card about a week ago. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, you did?  What?  Yeah.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  Mailed out with the rest of them, was it?  I think she was showing me some love before I went to New Orleans.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And I think she wrote something like, uh, you complete me or something.  You complete me.  You complete me.  And Rick's wife said that his card wasn't as big as she was expecting.  Well, the way you talked it up yesterday, I'm sure she was expecting one of those big, uh... 
[00:02:30]  Well, you know how we like to exaggerate.  I made it sound like Rick's card was as big as that doorway.  Yeah.  Like I said yesterday, like those cards that you pass around the office when someone's leaving.  You ever see those, Jimmy?  Those big cards and everyone signs them.  Everyone in the office signs.  Ah, yeah.  Happy, happy retirement.  Or get well soon.  Get well soon.  We miss ya.  YA.  We know there's no cure for what you're currently wasting away of.  Yeah, well...  Sorry to hear about your hymn. 
[00:03:00]  But don't want to say I told you so, dot, dot, dot.  Sorry, this card's heavier than you.  Oh, man.  Oh, stop.  Well, you know, we've all seen them.  Ben, I think it's the Daily News after all.  Look how prepared we are.  Well, there was a guy in New York.  He gave his ex-girlfriend...  Oh, I heard about this guy.  He gave her the finger for Valentine's Day. 
[00:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  Gave her the finger.  Not the way you usually give someone the finger.  The guy you pass by, you flip him the bird.  That doesn't seem like that big a deal.  No, he cut off his middle finger.  And sent it to his girlfriend.  Like Ann said earlier this week, thank God things are getting back to normal here in  New York.  Yep.  We have the serial pedestrian guy that we caught, who they arrested.  The S&M freak.  Yeah, he's an S&M freak.  It turns out this guy was whack.  And his neighbors are saying, oh, he was kind of a loner. 
[00:04:00]  But, you know, I never would have expected this out of him.  He's a loner.  You never talked to him, but you never would have expected it out of him.  What do you think he was doing instead of talking to you?  Dopey neighbors.  Idiots.  I love Ronald Popovich.  You like that guy now?  No, I don't know.  Adding his name to your vocabulary?  I love him.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He looks like Tom from New Orleans.  He kind of does.  Yeah.  And he probably drives better.  How you got it done?  God damn.  How you got it done?  Shut up, Tom. 
[00:04:30]  I'm doing good.  Okay, here we go.  Yeah.  Valentine's Day gift to ex-bloody awful.  A jilted lover gave his ex-girlfriend the finger yesterday, wrapping up his severed middle  digit and sending it to her at work in Manhattan.  Oh, boy.  Then he called and asked her, how did you like your Valentine's Day gift?  How did you like your Valentine's Day gift?  This is a sick, bitch.  Take it and shove it.  Now, then the cops arrested the guy.  I guess you're not allowed to send body parts through the mail or something, huh? 
[00:05:00]  I think they arrested him for harassment.  That would seem to be some kind of a stalking, harassment kind of a thing.  Cops arrested this guy, Forrest, 24.  His left hand wrapped in a fresh bandage and took him to Bellevue Hospital for a psychiatric  evaluation.  The heart-sick Romeo, still pining for the hairstylist he dated before their breakup a year ago,  used a messenger to deliver the black jewelry box containing the finger to House of Field, 
[00:05:30]  a boutique and hair salon in the East Village.  The shop is owned by blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The hairstylist opens the box and there's three quarters of a finger inside it and it's all bloody.  And then the chick called the cops.  Wouldn't you say that guy really cares about her?  Would you ever cut a finger off for a girl?  Hell no.  See, that guy, she's just misunderstanding.  We have him at Bellevue?  I hate this place. 
[00:06:00]  The medications don't work.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  Years.  Years.  Years.  Years.  Whatever happened to our Bellevue chick?  Remember the chick from the special?  Anyone from the New Cities that we're in?  If you'd seen on HBO a special on Bellevue, the mental institution, we actually became friendly  with the girl that was featured in that.  The one that sang Daddy's...  That sang Angela.  Daddy's home or Daddy's girl or whatever.  Daddy's home.  Your daddy's home to stay. 
[00:06:30]  I miss you, Daddy.  Remember her?  Yeah.  And then, like, she was all cool and everything.  And we were saying, how could this girl, such a normal, cool girl, be featured in a Bellevue  special?  And then the last time we heard from her, she called in and was like, okay, this is the  Bellevue chick.  Yeah, she was having some fun.  All right.  I don't know what happened to her, but...  Now I understand.  But I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing things.  Aw.  Yeah.  She was kind of cool.  All right, let's go to Young Buck.  Young Buck, what's going on? 
[00:07:00]  Young Buck.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  I wanted to tell Mr. Norton his first show at the TLA sold out in five minutes.  Look at you, Jim Norton.  Philadelphia is representing.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, there is a second show on sale.  Yeah, I got the ticket for the second show, bro.  Yeah!  Norton, is that that five-seat arena that you're playing?  That's quite impressive.  Nice.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, Jim Norton's tickets go on sale today.  For all over the country.  Well, not all over the country, but where are you going with this?  Who are you, Madonna? 
[00:07:30]  Look at you selling out in a matter of minutes.  No, but I do like Spanish, man.  Where are you going to be?  Buffalo, Cleveland.  Buffalo, Cleveland, Boston at the Avalon Ballroom, obviously New York Town Hall,  and Philadelphia, the TLA's second show has been added.  Why not Washington?  I'm getting a lot of email from people.  Why not Washington?  What happened with Washington?  I would like to get down to Washington very much.  We do have listeners down there.  We make fun of the fact that we don't, but we really do have listeners.  I'm feeling good about Washington.  And they would love to check you out.  Yeah, Washington, D.C.  We're looking at something. 
[00:08:00]  My agent's checking into it now, so it looks like May, actually, for Washington.  And how can they get tickets so we can get this out of the way and do a radio show today?  I wasn't even going to plug it.  I was going to say that if you guys want to go see one of my awful performances,  you can go to eatabullet.com, and ticket links are there.  And as far as the mailing list, can I apologize?  Everyone wanted a mailing list.  I called AOL.  AIDS Online is what that should stand for, because they stink.  Oh, my God.  All these great people email me.  I would like to be on a mailing list.  I do it by city so I don't interrupt anybody.  Oh, that's pretty good. 
[00:08:30]  And the effing AOL, there's a problem.  You cannot allow.  You can't mass email through AOL.  They'll shut you down.  Oh, I hate them.  They will shut you down, my friend.  AOL stinks.  Well, Norton, if you were a little more computer savvy, perhaps you would get an Internet provider  that isn't out there for 14-year-old girls to find men to molest them on.  You know what I mean?  All right, so it's got its advantages.  That's the only reason I kept it.  Go on.  AOL is like the starter kit for the Internet. 
[00:09:00]  Everyone's been there.  But eventually, you know what you do?  You move on because you realize the restrictions on AOL.  Then you get yourself a regular Internet provider, something like Optimum Online through cable,  something fast, something that you don't have to deal with the crap that you put up with  with AOL.  You're right.  And Ronald Popovich and I have discussed this.  I mean, I'm not saying that you're wrong.  So everyone who knows computers has said stay away from America Online and I stay with them.  It's great to have as a standby.  Like if you're in some faraway land and you have your laptop and you need a quick dial-up, 
[00:09:30]  AOL's got them all over the country.  You don't have to worry about your Internet provider not having a number, an access number.  So AOL's there for that.  But for sending out mailing lists and stuff, now you've got yourself a website, eatabullet.com,  if I may say, and you've got your mailing list that you want to put out.  You've got to bump yourself up a little bit in the computer world.  Do you have a cable modem at home?  I certainly do.  You have a cable modem and you still use AOL?  I do.  Don't you have your cable, the cable company that provides your cable modem? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, Roadrunner.  Roadrunner, you have an email address under Roadrunner online.  I know.  You know that.  And you can send out as many as you want.  As much email as you want.  But, you know, who knows, guys?  I'm just being silly.  I just want to.  Look at him.  He doesn't know.  I just wanted to do the email.  Looks like that kid in the bag again.  All confused face.  Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.  He's the internet crinkle, crinkle guy.  You have mail, crinkle, crinkle.  Confused little face.  So, all right. 
[00:10:30]  Hands clutching and unclutching with nothing.  So, real fast.  How do people get the tickets for those shows?  They can just check eatabullet.com and there's all kinds of tickets.  Yeah, but some people are lazy.  They don't want to.  I don't have the numbers with me.  I probably should.  But it's either Ticketmaster?  Oh, Ticketmaster for everywhere but Boston.  Boston is next ticketing.  There you go.  There you go.  Very good.  You will not want to miss any of these shows with Jim Norton.  And I'll have a good guy with me, believe me.  Anthony?  Steve Robinson or somebody.  Cool.  It just hit me but I think we can do a new bit on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:11:00]  What's that?  I think a new feature just popped in my head.  A new feature?  Better than bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang for later?  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Yeah.  You know how we just read the story about the guy who, you know, sent his middle finger for  Valentine's Day?  Uh-huh.  I think we should do, from time to time, a little contest within the cities we're syndicated  to find the biggest freak in the newspaper for that day.  Oh!  I like it. 
[00:11:30]  We'll give the rest of the country the guy that cut off his middle finger for Valentine's  Day and sent it to his ex.  Yeah, but how much of a time window do they have?  Like, it's got to be something in today's news?  It's got to be today's news.  Today's news.  We'll only do it.  You can't go back, like, you know, five years.  This is what we'll do.  We'll start the contest.  Like, when we see a freak in the New York paper, we'll see if the other cities can beat our  freak.  But we got two.  We got the guy with the middle finger that he sent to his ex, and we also got the S&M  pudgy guy that's running over pedestrians that we finally caught. 
[00:12:00]  That guy, fun guy.  That could be a new feature, by the way.  Yeah.  People who are getting run over by cars and just call it the Papa Ditches that'll get you.  It's the Papa Ditches that'll get you.  The Papa Ditches that'll get you.  Well, Anthony, we got a candidate coming in from Boston.  Oh, good.  To try to beat middle finger man.  Let's go to Buck.  Hey, Buck, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I just didn't know if you guys had heard about it.  I think it was at Lowell. 
[00:12:30]  I saw it on the news last night here in Boston about some guy, some gal, who beat up a 51-year-old  lady because she had too many items in the checkout lane.  I love this woman.  I love it.  I think she's the hero of every supermarket, you know, a patron everywhere.  You know, I do not take 13 items to the 12-item line.  I just don't do it.  You know why?  Because I don't like when people do it to me.  And I'll count your goddamn items.  But who's counting?  I'll be counting.  I'm counting.  You don't count.  What if the 13th item is like a pack of gum? 
[00:13:00]  Don't care.  Don't care.  Take it up one more line, lady.  And if you put a six-pack down, is that six items or one?  No.  It's rung up as one item.  It is one goddamn item.  And that's what causes people to drive around running over people.  Don't take, like, 12 huge cans of V8 or something and consider it one item.  You know, these sons of bitches, I'm glad this woman got that crap beat out of her.  I'm saying that's why people get run over on streets, you know, by the people who get pissed off like that, man.  They go run down people on the streets.  It might sound petty and stuff, but to tell you the God's honest truth, it says 12 goddamn items. 
[00:13:30]  12 items.  You got 13?  Take it to the next line.  That's what I'm saying.  I have done this.  And I count.  Because I look and go, this looks like more than 12 on this C in front of me.  And they're the same ones that pile up the goddamn groceries on the 12 line and then get there.  And they're paying with friggin' drachma or Star Trek money.  They never just pull out cash and pay for it.  They always got some, oh, I got a check. 
[00:14:00]  Do you have the check cashing card with it?  Oh, no, I don't have that.  But there's always a problem with those people.  So what happened with this story?  I don't know.  It was kind of like, you know, the woman interviewed on the police, or excuse me, on the news just said that the lady,  they were, you know, offhandedly ripping off back and forth each other.  And the other girl just beat her up and walked away.  All right, Buck, hold on.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Anthony will help you out here.  The woman, I believe she was in her mid-30s, was online. 
[00:14:30]  The woman in front of her was 51.  She had 13 items in the 12-item line.  13 items.  They got in a little bit of a fight about it online, I guess.  You know, back and forth kind of.  See, I'll just huff and puff.  I'm not going to start a fight because the person in front of me has one more item.  I am.  But you know something?  I won't either.  But I'm so glad there are cooks.  I mean, if she's up to 20 or so, then, yeah, I'm going to have a slight problem.  I'm glad there are nutty, nutty people out there that will start fights over it.  So because the lady had 13, the other lady beat the crap out of her?  They were mouthing off a little bit to each other. 
[00:15:00]  And then outside in the parking lot, I guess the woman in her mid-30s jumped the 51-year-old  and started pounding her because of her 13th item.  But I love nuts like that.  I love it.  It was Boston, right, Ant?  Yep.  Was the 13th item a box of wine?  Box of wine!  Let me tell you, I am in a big rush to get home.  I can't be standing on lines that are full of people buying a lot of groceries. 
[00:15:30]  And it takes me longer to get home to feed my dog because I have to make three rights  instead of making a left to get home.  The supermarket's right around the corner, but it still takes me 45 minutes to drive there.  Let me check out my items.  I got dog food.  I got four boxes of wine.  I got two six-packs and one box of wine.  That's 12, 13. 
[00:16:00]  But I also have dog food.  I have dog food for the dog in the urn.  I still feed him.  I can't be on line with people buying a lot of groceries.  It takes me a long time to get home because I don't make left on turns.  Left on turns are very dangerous, but I have noticed I put together a formula for driving.  I'm off.  Go ahead. 
[00:16:30]  It's a left.  It's a left.  And all I told the woman when she asked me why I went to this line, I said, I want to go home.  It takes me too long.  I want to go home.  So I did a shot at Grandma Gay, and she beat the crap out of me.  All right.  Come on, go home.  Also, there's a kook in Boston today, a kook in New York.  Yeah.  Jay, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  What's happening?  You tell us.  Well, I want to know if you guys actually heard the story of that small town in Nebraska 
[00:17:00]  that found the severed penis near the car wash.  Yes.  Talk about your Valentine's Day bummer.  Where was the man junk?  I think it was beside this car wash, like laying on the ground, and somebody happened upon it,  like on the side.  The best part of the story is the authorities said that they weren't sure if it was some  type of attempted homicide or a violent act of person on person, or just an accident.  Yeah.  They said they don't know if it was self-inflicted or not. 
[00:17:30]  And I thought to myself, if it was self-inflicted, don't you think they might run to a hospital  afterwards, or at least to a liquor store or something?  Or just die.  You know what I mean?  They'd find a body without it.  But the funniest part was an accident.  Like someone would have an accident and go, whew, I guess I'm okay.  And then get home and go, oh, I didn't even notice.  I knew something brushed against me.  I felt a thud.  And I'm looking, and I thought I had just dropped my car keys.  I thought that's what hit the ground.  But thank God I'm alive.  Like you would kind of notice if it was an accidental severing of your junk. 
[00:18:00]  I like to groom myself at all.  I'm kind of a hygienic type guy.  But I don't think, you know, I've cut myself shaving, but that's a little bit overboard,  don't you think?  It's like Ray Charles down there.  What kind of facial scrub do you use?  Facial scrub?  I prefer an exfoliant on my face.  I think I use something of my wife, probably.  I really don't buy it on my own.  I know Norton doesn't like American Psycho, but the movie is great.  I love the movie.  I love the book.  I love the movie.  I just wanted to tell Norton that I can't wait for him to come up in Boston. 
[00:18:30]  I think he's a sick MF.  I think he's off.  Jay, let me tell you something.  Those tickets are going to go fast.  Yeah, I know.  I actually heard the commercial last night when I was driving home, and I really can't wait.  He's playing Avalon.  Go through next ticketing.  Excellent.  Hey, you guys are awesome.  I stopped here in Boston.  We love listening to you guys every day.  All right, Jay.  You guys are great.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Excellent.  Let's go to Phone Sex Kathy.  Hi, guys.  What's up, Phone Sex Kathy?  You had a lady in the shower yesterday.  A little bit more helpful for you guys.  You thought it was Daniela, contestant number 93 in the Naughty Naughty Contest. 
[00:19:00]  Make sure you vote every day for your Naughty Naughty contestants.  Shameless plug, yes.  Not too shameless.  I thought that just the sound of your guys' voices would have made her a little bit excited.  You think you'd have to be sodding her along.  You do Phone Sex for a living?  No, I don't.  It's a sideline.  Really?  So you're saying you're a little turned on by the voices of Opie and Anthony?  Is that it?  You can say that, sure.  Hey, Phone Sex Kathy, why don't you give us a sample of your work? 
[00:19:30]  Keep it clean for the radio, though.  Oh, well, that won't allow anyone to finish, will it?  You're right.  Um, let's see, you want to go with the shower scenario again?  Yeah, shower scenario.  All right, go ahead with the shower scenario.  Okay.  Do we need water effects for this?  Oh, yeah.  Of course, okay. 
[00:20:00]  And will this be with both of you?  I can tell already, this is going to roll.  Well, let's give her a chance, Anne.  Oh, I am.  All right, let's go.  And this will be with both of you?  Yeah.  Well, no, Anne, I, ugh, no.  No, no, do it with Norton.  Yeah, yeah, pick one of us, but not all of us.  No, not me.  No combos.  I don't like hearing it.  We're not into the combo platters.  You can do it with me.  Oh, it's going to be Norton?  Norman, yeah.  Yeah, Norman. 
[00:20:30]  Okay.  All right, we're ready.  Let her rep.  Phone Sex Kathy, here we go.  I'm going to start lathering up my body for you.  Leaning up against the wall.  You open the curtain and you see me there.  Watch the water trickling down.  You see it dancing off my breath. 
[00:21:00]  When you lean in and touch me, I pull away from you.  Start soaping myself.  Then you watch all of the foam run down my body.  I'm licking my lips for you.  Start getting my hair wet.  Looks wild and stringy. 
[00:21:30]  I pull you close to me.  Get in the shower with me.  Turn around.  Put my hands above my head against the tile.  Start running my hand between my thighs.  You're a girl. 
[00:22:00]  What are you doing?  You ruined it.  Wow.  You ruined it.  That was very sexy.  Phone sex.  My stupid voice.  What?  Kathy, that was really sexy.  That was very nice.  Where are you going from?  Now we're having fun. 
[00:22:30]  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from New Jersey.  Nice.  Not Woodbridge.  No.  Very good.  All right.  That was better than Daniela yesterday.  Oh, I hear a kid in the background.  You think sexy women don't have children, huh?  No, I don't think that at all, but, I don't know, it kind of wrecks it after mommy's moaning 
[00:23:00]  and then you hear the kid right away in the background.  Speak for yourself, Greg.  And I also don't think, here's why they don't think sexy women have kids, because when you're  ready to finish with a sexy girl, she doesn't let you do it there.  She goes, come on, I'm the face, fella.  I don't know, it's just the thought of hearing the kid in the background, knowing you're in  the shower and it probably looks like the log flume at Great Adventure with the water  hanging down it.  No, my funny friend.  Children tend to tear that area up. 
[00:23:30]  You know what I mean?  All right, phone sex, Kathy, that was very good.  All right, thanks, guys, you suck.  We needed that today.  What's wrong?  You didn't like that, Rick?  She couldn't be dirty, Rick, on the air.  It was all right.  Why don't we take a break?  No, she didn't, she was good.  Shut up.  We got lots to do today.  Yeah.  On the way, yeah, Naughty Nighty update.  Make sure you vote for your favorite.  We got to get it down to 20 by the time we're on the air next week, either Monday or Tuesday. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  We're going to have an Olympic update.  Oh, yes, very big, very big night for the United States last night, yes.  Yeah, we'll talk about that and how they gave that Canadian pair the gold after all.  And figure skating, right?  Oh, how's that for a topper?  Also on the way, dice on ice, possibly.  But, yeah, well.  We'll explain.  Shut up, Tom.  We'll explain next.  Just an observation.  Also, Mario Cantone stopping by today. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Very, very funny guy.  And I hear male Olympic figure skater, Mario Cantone.  Really?  Yeah.  And she has arrived.  We thought she was blowing us off.  Oh, no.  Stop it.  Really?  Headstand Yellow Disciplined Girl is here.  Oh, my God.  Look.  Norton's packing.  Look at that.  Look how far down his leg it's going.  Jesus.  That's from the phone sex Cathy, though, right?  Oh, you are despicable.  All right.  Well, so Headstand Yellow Disciplined Girl is here.  Ready for love. 
[00:25:00]  She's going to try to earn herself a spot.  Yes.  In the 55-gallon drum challenge.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my God.  What is she doing?  She's hyperventilating.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  And he...  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, Dan.  What's going on, man?  Hey.  How's it going?  You tell us.  I just almost died.  What happened?  That was excellent.  Listening to that girl.  Oh.  Doing the phone sex crap.  The shower girl.  Oh, you like phone sex Cathy?  Oh, dude.  She sounded hot.  Yeah, and then Anthony ruined it.  Oh, sorry.  I thought it would be funny.  Wacky.  Insane horrific.  It would be funny.  Yeah, I guess we got a new character.  Phone sex Cathy.  Out of nowhere.  Rick doesn't like her.  I enjoyed her. 
[00:26:00]  Kim Norton seemed to enjoy her.  Loved her.  Bunch of the listeners enjoyed her.  Yeah.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  A couple of instant feedbacks coming in.  Eric from Philly.  Norton, I got front row tickets for your second Philly show.  That's cool.  What's his name?  Guy, right?  Eric.  And he goes, I'm going to be really close.  Are you contagious?  And Jay from Edison.  Hey, Ann, I see your boy, Timmy Gaywad.  Gaywad.  Won himself a purdy little medal.  Tell us.  Purdy little medal. 
[00:26:30]  Did you spill your zima as you froliced about in your tutu?  Stop it.  Well, you must be excited that the Canadians finally got their gold.  Well, yes.  I do believe you started that campaign for everybody.  I actually did.  I was one of the first to say that they should have gotten the gold.  A lot of controversy.  The French figure skating judge has been suspended for buckling under again, just like the French.  It turns out that all the judges went to this hotel room, and the French judge was muscled by the Russian judges to vote for the Russian. 
[00:27:00]  Muscled.  Yeah, muscled.  They just, and the French judge, okay, but, yeah, well, they're all women.  They're all even the men are women.  There's no such thing.  It's redundant.  French woman.  Redundant.  So they got her in the hotel room, and, uh, yes, I will give you the vote for a pair of figure skating. 
[00:27:30]  And then, uh, in return, the French were supposed to win the ice dancing, which starts up, uh, when is that, Rick?  Do you know when the ice dancing starts?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow, the ice dancing.  Oh, you're going to have a busy weekend, Anthony.  But now the whole controversy is the French were favored for the ice dancing to win,  but now it's going to look like, hey, if the French win, now it's just the reciprocation on part of the Russian judges,  and we're still, uh, screwed. 
[00:28:00]  So, uh, I can't wait for the ice dancing.  So the, uh, men's single, uh, figure skating last night, the second half, or the long program, Opie.  Yeah, you explained the short program, and now it's the long program.  And, of course, um, Timothy Gable for the United States was, uh, sitting in third and on a big man junk after the short program.  And then, uh, going into the long program, very exciting last night.  And, uh, he pulled out a bronze medal. 
[00:28:30]  Well, from where?  From where, Rick says.  He pulled out a bronze.  So he got the bronze.  Well, the Russians, uh, won that.  The, uh, Russian guy, I don't remember his name, I don't know.  With the cute blonde hair?  No, he came in second.  He got the silver.  That guy's skate.  The guy with the blonde mullet.  Yeah.  And the Russian that won is actually, he lives in Connecticut.  He's becoming a U.S. citizen.  So it's, how, isn't that fascinating, Norton?  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  But, uh, Timothy Gable, boy, when he finished his, uh, routine and went back and held his little teddy bear waiting for his score.  Right.  But, uh, well, I was rooting for the gay one.  Well, you know, uh, I was hoping perhaps the guy that was in the lead, the Russian, would falter.  And, uh, then Timothy Gable would be able to claim the, uh, the silver.  But, no.  Alas, it wouldn't be.  Uh, but he did get the bronze. 
[00:29:30]  And, uh, it's just great to see Americans medal in, uh, this, uh, sport.  Sean has a great observation that I think a lot of us saw last night.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Sean.  Hey, guys, uh, first time in Olympic history that a male figure skater had a wife and kids.  Yeah, this was.  Unbelievable.  What is that guy's name?  Weiss?  I don't know, but his teeth looked like he, uh, they were all capped over and his father was there jumping in yelling.  You don't see nobody else.  And then you see Brian Boitano urging on that guy, uh, Eldridge.  Yeah, Brian Boitano was in the crowd. 
[00:30:00]  But how shocked were you to find out that one of the male figure skaters has a family, a wife?  I was shocked.  See you later, honey.  I'm going to the rink.  Gonna go figure skate with the guys.  Gonna go figure skate.  Because you know what it is.  Bring my cooler of beer.  He comes out on the ice.  And, uh, they say, yeah, it's his last, uh, Olympics.  He's only 25.  But he's, uh, not gonna skate anymore.  He's going back.  He lives in Fairfax, Virginia.  I hear he listens, uh, to WJFK in, uh, Washington. 
[00:30:30]  How about that one?  And, um, he says he's, uh, not gonna be in the Olympics anymore because he wants to spend more time with his children and his wife.  And I'm like, stop it.  What?  What?  Actually, he's not gonna skate anymore because he finally figured it out.  It's a gay sport.  After looking around for years, he goes, Jesus Christ, what the hell am I in?  What was the deal with the guy who came in second place?  Hey, being married doesn't mean anything, man.  You ever see Dog Day Afternoon?  But Chino was married to him. 
[00:31:00]  Why do you do this?  You're not dying.  You're killing everyone around you.  You're killing everyone around you.  You guys suck.  Oh, you gotta stop this.  It's craziness.  Algeria, they run around with a bunch of things on their head.  They're crazy people.  Crazy people.  You thought Wisconsin was a country?  Michael Weiss from Fairfax, Virginia.  So he comes out on the ice and they show his wife.  She's like a blonde, big blonde bombshell type. 
[00:31:30]  And his father.  And he skates out and he looks like just some Italian guy.  He's like got the slicked back hair.  And he goes into the routine.  And I'm like, I even said to my girlfriend, I go, how does a heterosexual guy emote with his body like that?  Like he's dancing on the ice.  He does the arm thing.  You can expect it from the gay guys that are figure skating.  You know, they're very artistic and their arms are going.  And they're doing all those hand things.  Like, look, I'm grabbing at the sun. 
[00:32:00]  You know, and things like that.  But it's like, yeah, I expect the guy to go, honey, I thought I signed up for hockey.  I put the skates on and I don't know what happened.  But then he starts his routine.  And he's just as gay on the ice as the gay guys.  Then he gets done and he walks off the ice.  And that's it.  Yeah, pops a beer, I guess.  Was he holding a teddy bear or something?  He wasn't holding the teddy bear.  No, all the gay guys got little.  I guess it's their good luck charms when they finish their skating and they're sitting on the chair waiting for the marks to come in. 
[00:32:30]  They hold little things like a teddy bear.  One guy had the eye from Monsters, Inc.  You know that character?  He was holding that very tightly.  Those are just the first gifts they got in the hospital after being beaten by skinheads.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my Jesus.  Eatabull.com.  Jim Norton, come to your town.  But he's just like an Italian guy out there.  I'm trying hard.  I like, you know, I like the figure skating. 
[00:33:00]  It's a new direction for me.  It's dice on ice.  I was a little disappointed with my performance.  I pulled off the quad.  And then I go into the triple saw cow.  I can only pull off a double.  But I hit the toe loop.  I hit it.  So I'm scared.  Hey, guys, what do you think of my...  I went with the gold lame.  I see that dice.  I was going to go with the silver, but it was a little tacky. 
[00:33:30]  We're watching your performance right now.  It looks good.  You're skating backwards right here.  I'm very proud of this move.  Yeah.  See, it comes up.  I do the spin thing.  Oh, hey.  And now, look.  I jumped over there.  But look where I land.  I'm over here now.  I jump over there.  I land over here now.  But there I am.  Now I'm twirling.  I'm very dainty on the ice.  Most people say I'm a big guy.  I'm dainty on the ice.  It brings out my feminine side.  Look at you reaching for the sun right here. 
[00:34:00]  And now I'm reaching, reaching.  Nice, nice.  And here I go.  Yeah.  Now I go down into the low leg grab spin.  And look at my head.  My head's flying like when...  I call this the head, the dice camel.  Uh-oh.  It was the hammer camel, but now it's mine.  Look at you flying around the ice now.  Now look, I got some speed up.  I see that.  I go all the way from over there to over here now.  Now I'm in front of the judges.  There's one quad, a triple, and a triple.  Oh! 
[00:34:30]  Oh!  I pulled that off.  Oh!  Bop!  So I'm skating, right?  Yeah.  And this fag wants to put his tongue up my...  Oh!  Now I'm going...  Look at me backwards.  Look, I'm skating backwards.  Look at my head.  And the costume's good.  I wear a lame leather jacket with dice bedazzled on the back.  Oh!  Well, it's a little weird with the sweatpants, though, Dice.  Yeah, well, the sweatpants help. 
[00:35:00]  It helps with the atrodynamics.  Oh, you're slowing it down, though.  Now I slow it down.  Here's where I get dramatic.  Okay, very.  Here I...  Now I'm going for another jump.  I hit that one.  Oh!  The quad!  And now a toe loop.  And now I grab my foot and spin on the ice.  Look at it.  Look at my hair.  I'm handsome out there.  What?  Do they score for handsome?  Oh, they should.  Now I do something no one else does. 
[00:35:30]  What's that?  I bring midgets out on the ice with me.  Watch me jump the midget.  Oh!  Look at that.  Now I look.  I put my leg on top of the midget.  And he's skating like he's my leg.  I bend it to the...  Oh, here we go.  Now I go into an Italian thing.  It's the tarantula song.  Look, look.  I'm skipping on the ice.  You can barely tell I'm wearing skates. 
[00:36:00]  You're running on your toes, I see.  Eeeh!  Eeeh!  Yeah, the other skaters in the back, they go,  Oh, dice.  Why do you have to be so good at skating?  I go, take the sea out of your way.  Faggot!  Ow!  Now I'm passing by the judges.  A toe loop.  A spin.  Give me a perfect score.  Eeeh!  Bump the gold medal spine. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, here we go.  Oh, bravo.  Nice finish.  Thank you.  See how I threw my hands up in the air?  Very nice.  That's dainty.  Now wait, I gotta wait for my scores.  You went down on one knee there.  Very nice.  All right.  Look, instead of the stuffed animal, what am I holding?  A midget.  It's in my lap.  A midget.  I wait for my scores.  Uh-huh.  6-0, 6-0, 6-0.  Dice wins.  Oh!  No controversy there. 
[00:37:00]  The French judge screws me.  I'm gonna plow.  Hey, French judge, suck my banana juice.  Eeeh!  It's dice on ice.  I like the dice on ice.  Very good.  Oh!  I'm having trouble with the quad.  Hey, Club Soda Kenny, collect my roses, okay?  Hey, happy face, get my roses.  The people love me. 
[00:37:30]  Out on the ice.  Hey, Timmy, the gay boy.  What's with the hair?  What's with the moosey curly hair?  He don't skate like me.  I'm the best.  And I'm handsome.  See the guy that looks like the lead singer of Def Leppard?  No, that's the blonde guy.  Hey, blondie.  You know one thing?  He skates backwards.  The hair looks beautiful.  It's beautiful.  Oh!  I skate unbelievable. 
[00:38:00]  I get the gold medal.  M-bop!  Now it's mine.  Look at my ass in this outfit.  It's gorgeous.  I like the tight ass on it.  I leave the legs loose so I can do my jumps.  And the choreography's gorgeous.  I learned that at Pips when I used to play there in Brooklyn.  Dice, someone wants to know if you're going to consider hair skating.  What, with like a chick? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, or maybe a little of that ice dance.  What, do I lay it down and put my yam bag in her face?  Oh!  Score me!  I win!  Bop!  And now to finish and move.  Mule juice on the face.  Pinch the helmet.  Pinch the helmet.  Soak I win.  Oh!  Oh!  Get me another broad.  This one's full of goo.  She can't skate with goo in her eyes.  I banana juiced her eyes shut. 
[00:39:00]  She's skating into the walls.  She looks like a retard.  Oh!  Dice in honor.  Dice on ice!  In honor of Dice on Ice, I got a little something for you here, okay?  Okay.  Dice, dice, baby.  Oh!  I'm checking in from over here.  Dice, dice, baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Dice, dice, baby.  Oh!  Dice, dice, baby.  Dice, dice, baby.  Dice, dice, baby.  Oh!  Dice, dice, nice. 
[00:39:30]  Oh!  Dice, dice, baby.  I'm over here now.  Dice, dice, baby.  Gotta love the dice.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I'm over here now.  I gotta have that. 
[00:40:00]  I got your legs.  Okay, terrific.  Don't just stare at it, eat it.  Just look at me like a chick with balls.  He's a jack-o'-fix-pointer, see?  Nice, nice, baby.  He's a scumbag!  Nicey, nice.  I'm over here, here.  Nicey, nice. 
[00:40:30]  I'm good like that, my friend.  Get full of crap.  Look what we did to you again.  Very good.  Drew Boogie.  That's nice.  That's the song gonna play when I accept my gold.  I see that.  I step up on the podium.  The gold is mine.  People ask, hey, dice, what are you gonna do after the Olympics?  I'm gonna go pro.  You're going pro?  I'm skating around for money.  Yeah.  I got something I got, I'm working on a thing.  Yeah.  You know the thing?  You're gonna help me with the thing?  Are you talking about dice-capades? 
[00:41:00]  The dice-capades!  Like, look at me, I'm skating with Snoopy, it's crazy.  Here comes Charlie Brown.  Look, I'm in the cast of Beauty and the Beast.  Hey, Beauty, dump the Beast, I'll dump a load of goo on you.  Dice-capades, now it's mine.  Matt has a question for you, Dice on Ice.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I want to know if Dice is gonna be the first person in international competition to pull 
[00:41:30]  off the quadruple plow cow.  Ah, nah, nah.  You're not stealing that from me.  People do the sow cow.  No.  I do the plow cow.  I bring a fat, disgusting pig on the ice, and I plow her on her back.  The judges love that kind of thing.  I'm just plowing her, smacking her fat cans as I gently go down the ice.  People go dice, how are you so dainty while you're banging this fat slob? 
[00:42:00]  Oh!  You got some other moves there, Dice, or what?  Nah, I like the quad, that's good.  And the toe loop.  Yeah.  That's a fun one.  Uh-huh.  And then I got a new one.  What's that?  It's called the triple boogaloo.  I jump, it's like a quad, but as I jump, I go boogaloo-galoo, boogaloo-galoo, boogaloo-galoo.  I'm over here now.  And when I land, I'm over here now.  I started over there, I land boogaloo-galoo, I'm over here now.  Oh, Kenny, get my flowers. 
[00:42:30]  Why is this full of so many faggots?  Everywhere I turn, another fag.  All right.  Very good.  So catch dice on ice in the dice capades.  I got a sponsorship, too, Cadillac Escalator.  The guy driving, the Escalator.  The what?  Oh, shut up. 
[00:43:00]  And then my big finish after the boogaloo-galoo.  Yeah.  It's to look what I did to you again.  Ow!  Pinch the mule, pinch the mule, pinch the mule.  And then the banana juice out of my yam bag.  So much, they got to bring out the Zamboni to clear the ice.  Goo all over.  You know that move where you stop short and the ice goes flying on your skates? 
[00:43:30]  Sure.  I do that in front of the judges with my yam bag juice.  They're covered.  The French judge likes he's covered in strudel.  Oh, you love it, you pig whore.  All right, dice, dice on ice, everyone.  Bravo.  Go to break.  Why?  We can do it for another half hour, I think.  We haven't quite drilled it into the ground yet. 
[00:44:00]  Vince or Stephanie McMahon calling in today, Anthony.  Vince or Stephanie?  Who do you want more to call in today?  You know what?  I love Stephanie and all that, but Vince is just way too entertaining when he's on our show.  Push for Vince.  Push for Vince.  Push for Vince.  Definitely want Vince.  Also, headstand yellow discipline girl.  Trying to impress us for a spot.  Right.  In the 55-gallon drum challenge.  And lots of stuff to do, so.  Stay there.  Don't be an a-hole. 
[00:44:30]  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself, okay.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Give us a call.  Let's say hi to Don.  Don, what's up, man?  Yo, guys, that had to be the funniest effing thing I've ever heard.  Oh, look at that.  A compliment.  Dice on ice.  I can't wait until it comes around this way.  Dice on ice. 
[00:45:00]  You know what?  We might have to replay that later on in the show.  What's the move?  What's the signature move you got there, Dice?  I think you explained it all there, John.  Yeah, I think so.  But the name of it.  What was it called?  I can't remember.  You think I remember?  Who's Dice talking?  The plow cow?  Yeah, that's what it was.  The plow cow.  Hey, thank you, Don.  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry, what's up? 
[00:45:30]  Hey, man, it's Friday and I want to go bang, bang, bang.  Oh, yeah.  Go crazy, Jerry.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Yeah.  Good job, Jerry.  You're crazy.  I'm crazy. 
[00:46:00]  God damn, that is funny.  Hey, one more bang for you.  Bang, bang.  Thank you, Jerry.  That is friggin' funny, man.  It's not supposed to be what the other station does.  No.  Bob, what's up?  Yeah, with Dice on Ice, so-and-funny guy.  Yeah, a lot of people call and say that exact same thing.  We're going to replay it, man.  We have to.  I just inadvertently formed Yellow Discipline on myself. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, cool.  All right, Bob.  You guys suck.  Maybe later on.  Yeah, ain't killed, man.  That's fun.  My God.  I mean, Dice.  Oh, I'm sorry, Dice.  Of course.  Forgot.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I just knocked down the third wall again.  You're screwing it up.  I'm crazy.  Crazy.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Oh, me.  You're being crazy.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. 
[00:47:00]  Come on.  Bang, bang, bang, bang.  Go, Anthony.  Go.  Bang.  That is the funniest lame bit I've ever heard.  Oh, I got to admit, it's fun. 
[00:47:30]  It is fun.  Bang, bang, bang.  They just call up and yell, bang, bang.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  What city is that?  What?  Boston.  Boston.  But they do it as a serious bit.  Right, I know.  The guy called yesterday and said it's so uncomfortable to listen to.  I think it's so funny, man.  Bang, bang.  Ah, Joe from Philly, what's going on? 
[00:48:00]  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a newspaper story for you, man.  Oh, you're going to, hold on, you're going to try to beat our kook here in New York?  I'm going to try and beat it, man.  All right, hold on, let me do the setup.  It's kind of a new bit from time to time.  We're going to see what city has the kookiest kook in the local paper.  Kookie?  That's the name of the bit.  The kookiest kook.  Kookiest kook?  Get a sweeper, Rick.  It's time for the kookiest kook.  In New York, we got a guy for Valentine's Day.  He cut off his finger and sent it to his ex.  And then called her up and said, how did you like your Valentine's gift? 
[00:48:30]  I'm still laughing and bang back.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I know.  I am sorry.  It is too funny.  But he gave her the finger, the middle finger.  And then Boston, some 30-year-old lady beat up a 51-year-old lady because she had more  than 12 items in the 12-item lane.  Yeah.  13 items.  So what do you got there, Joe, in Philly today?  Well, in the Philadelphia Daily News, there's a story about some bimbo who's got a bad car  battery.  So she figures the best way to start it in the morning is to leave it running all night 
[00:49:00]  in the garage.  In the garage.  In the garage.  In the closed garage.  Yes.  The closed garage.  They find five members of her family dead from carbon monoxide poisoning this morning.  Is she dead too?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Well, at least she doesn't have to go through that guilt thing.  Imagine killing your whole goddamn family.  Because you're an idiot.  Can you imagine that?  Yeah.  That happens every so often, though.  The carbon monoxide poisoning.  Some dope wheels the car in there.  Drunk, maybe, falls asleep.  But haven't we learned by now that you just shouldn't do that? 
[00:49:30]  Some people do it on purpose because they want to die and take out their family, but there's  always that story in the paper.  Someone's just stupid.  Thinning the herd.  There you go.  They call it thinning the herd.  Not with the car, but it was a boiler downstairs.  Carbon monoxide poisoning.  No, it was, yeah, whatever.  Yeah, carbon monoxide poisoning.  Was it?  Yeah.  Okay.  From a water heater.  Thank you, Joe.  Thanks, guys.  One rule.  Not all the baby turtles are going to make it to the ocean.  No. 
[00:50:00]  No.  Some of them flopping those little baby turtle arms to the beach and a big seagull comes  and just grabs them up.  Some of them make it to the water.  Big fish eats them.  They don't all make it.  Some of them just roll over and little ditch in the sand, stay on their back, and the sun  bakes them.  Ivan, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Guys, I don't.  I want to tell my boss, Glenn, to take his job and shove it.  I'm quitting today.  Yeah.  Oh, we need the song if you're going to tell your boss to shove it.  I know.  Where's take this job and shove it? 
[00:50:30]  Take this job and shove it.  All right, you're going to have to call back later because we're going to have to find  that song.  Thank you, boys.  We weren't prepared for the take that job and shove it segment today.  It's Johnny Paycheck, isn't it?  Norman, you're wrong.  Who?  Norman.  I thought it was Johnny Paycheck.  I did that one.

[01:55:30]  Yeah really fast  Mario Cantone hanging with us today  Hi boys  He's playing Caroline Sunday and Monday right here in New York City  But right now we gotta go to the phones and talk to Vince McMahon  Vince McMahon  Hey guys how are you?  Very good how are you?  Terrific  You know I haven't talked to you in a while  The stuff that is going on in the WWF these days is unbelievable  I love it  The fact that you  How the hell  Are you bringing Hulk Hogan back? 
[01:56:00]  Well I really don't know  Explain yourself sir  Please explain yourself  I don't think I can  I can't explain that one to myself  So if I can't explain it to me  I sure as hell can't explain it to me  I don't know what's more horrific  Vince bringing back Hulk Hogan to the WWF  Or Vince looking down his own daughter's shirt  Wait a minute I couldn't help that  Oh my god  I'm glad you said it  Vince we were watching Raw this Monday  Just before you were going to walk Stephanie down  I'm going to walk you down the long aisle  And he takes a look down his daughter's cleave 
[01:56:30]  And my girlfriend  Did you ever see a wedding dress like that?  No  No  My girlfriend openly went  She was disgusted  Thank you  Take your bra off  Take her off now  He didn't say that  Oh my god  I tell you though  Stephanie has come such a long way  When she first was chained to that boiler  As Undertaker was trying to have his way with her  Right  And now it's like a completely different person 
[01:57:00]  Yeah she's on now  Yeah she's very good  Hey Vince have you seen the pictures on the internet yet of your lovely daughter?  No I haven't  Vince did you hear what happened?  Well let me inform you what happened  You might have sick some lawyers after some websites  Alright  Including when you are  Including foundrymusic.com  Well you know what happened during the match is  When Stephanie hit the ground  Wasn't a match really  Well it was the wedding  Yeah  The renewal of vows  And Triple H pushed her down 
[01:57:30]  Yeah  It seems somebody was pretty handy at freeze framing something  And your lovely daughter Stephanie's nips were kind of showing  If you look down the top of the wedding dress  Oh my god  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Vince are you at a computer right now?  No I'm not actually  You might want to check that out  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Yeah so what's  Now what can you tell us about  No Way Out 
[01:58:00]  And NWL coming back  And especially Hulk Hogan  Coming back into the ring for the WWF  Well I think that they're going to look to make some impact  At No Way Out  I would think so  What that impact is  You know we'll have to stay tuned  But  I think that impact is going to result in a broken hip  For Hulk Hogan  A broken hip?  You know the guy's not a kid anymore  No he's not  And the leg drop thing Vince  Yeah you think it's a little passe?  With what's going on these days? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah well  Let's put it this way  You should put him in the ring with Mae Young  When you're watching people doing triple back flips off of ladders  It's like a little rough to just say  Hey brother I'm going to jump off and hurt myself  Yeah well he might do that  But then again you might see he's in great shape  I think he's probably in the best shape he's ever been  Is he?  Yeah he looks terrific  Yeah  And he might see a different Hogan  Really?  Yep  Oh my goodness 
[01:59:00]  Is that an endorsement for Hulk Hogan?  No that's not an endorsement  It kind of sounds like you're  I don't know I'm not going to endorse Hogan  Pumping him up a little bit  What is Vince McMahon hoping happens at No Way Out?  Well a couple things  I'm certainly hoping that Triple H loses his match  Well of course he wronged your little girl  Oh my god I can't believe that  How many times are you going to go back and forth to hating your daughter and loving her?  Well you know that's the way it is  You know that's what happens in families like ours 
[01:59:30]  I guess a family is most dysfunctional  Ain't no good lying bitch  That's what he called your daughter  Yeah that was pretty good  So now she's guest referee in the match  That's right  Which ought to be pretty fun I'm sure  Some hijinks and shenanigans are going to be happening there Norton  Yeah hopefully she takes care of her nips in some way though  Yeah please  Vince if I were you  Some of that double sided tape or glue I hear they use sometimes  Because you know the cameras  They're just waiting for stuff like that to happen 
[02:00:00]  No doubt about it  And what else?  What do you see happening with NWO?  Well again I think NWO is going to make an impact  And I think that they're not going to pick on any small potatoes  I think it could very well be  Something to do with Rock  Or something to do with Stone Cold  Or maybe even Triple H  Woo!  Yeah I know  What are you  He's a pain in my ass  What are you going to do with him at NWO?  Anything going on?  Rick Flair?  I'm not certain yet actually  But there's likely to be something there with Flair as well 
[02:00:30]  I know what's going to happen with Flair  You do?  Tell me  He's tricking everyone  He's going to be  Join the NWO  Do you think?  Oh yeah  He's going to be in charge of the NWO  Flair is?  Yeah I think  So you think they'll bring them out  And it's going to look like  Because Flair is so against him  And then there's going to be a little switch  And then all of a sudden  Vince is on the mat getting his ass kicked  Again?  Again  You know  Nothing beats the Vince McMahon getting his ass kicked face  When his eyes get big 
[02:01:00]  He makes the open mouth  And just starts convulsing on the floor  I love it  I goddamn love it  Vince  We were telling everyone the other day  You never disappoint man  Thank you  Never disappoint  Always funny  You're always on  Always entertaining  It's disappointing when you're not on the screen  Vince  I don't want to sound like I'm  Kissing your ass  Kiss my ass  But it's true  It's just  It's goddamn great entertainment  I love watching it  How obnoxious is that what?  Does it ever bother you? 
[02:01:30]  Every now and then it'll throw you  Yeah  Like it's funny  But it's really  At some point  You want to get a line out  And  What?  What?  The whole crowd's just yelling  What?  It's really got to piss you off  It throws your timing off  And it's like you have to go out there  And be thinking about  Exactly how are you going to get your message across  Because  You know  That what will definitely screw you up  When you grabbed the mic during the vows  When they were doing the vows the other day  I was like  Stop it  This is a serious  I was crying man  People had no respect 
[02:02:00]  No respect  Vince  Bastards  That's your audience for God's sake  That's for sure  I love them all  I bet you do  Anthony on line 9  I think Vince kind of answered this  He once asked Vince why he stared at Steph's boobs  Well like he said  You can't help it  I mean they were just there  Vince  She really went too big  Was there a corporate meeting about them?  Anything?  No  No corporate meeting  No  Stephanie  I got some good news and some bad news  Nothing like that?  No 
[02:02:30]  Nothing like that  Breast implants  Everyone keeps asking about the heartbreak kid  Will he ever come back?  Sure he will  Really?  Wow  Wow look at that  Wow  But you know  Again to what extent I'm not certain  But I think he's starting to get the hunger a bit  Oh really?  Yep  Just never alone in a room with you huh?  Probably not  Yeah that was something  Alright  And what about Shane? 
[02:03:00]  Shane is taking a bit of a hiatus  He's doing the corporate thing right now  Is he?  Yep  How about you roll on soon?  He died  Did he die?  He's dead  He died last year  I did not know that  It was a very sad day  God  Thanks for bringing the show down  I didn't know that  I really didn't know that  Jesus  Vince  We work with people that don't know wrestling like him  Obviously  So I apologize  Stuck in the past  So you have a Chief J Strongbow question you want to ask Vince? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah there you go  I was just thinking of guys that grew up watching it  Hey what happened to Ivan Putzky?  Whatever did happen to him?  And what's the deal with Goldberg?  Anything?  Anything?  No actually he's pretty content just to sit on him and collect a check  Most people would take that option as well  He's got it made  He really didn't have to work for a living  I guess so  What an idiot though  He'd have so much heat  He'd have so much fun  There's no doubt about that  It'd be a riot  But you never can tell  Maybe you'll get bored one day  And decide what the heck  You'll come back and work for a living 
[02:04:00]  Well I'll tell you something  The whole Hogan thing really proves that  You never ever know what's going to happen  That's for sure  Because I mean  Whoever thought you'd see Hogan again  Involved at the WWF  I didn't  Is it really going to be Hogan Vince  Or is it going to be some guy dressed up  Goofing around  The Huckster  Like the Huckster  And the Nacho Man  That was a riot  Did he talk to you about any of that stuff  Hey real funny stuff Vince  No actually we didn't talk about it 
[02:04:30]  No huh  No  Does he get to beat you up  Not anytime soon than I know of  Alright  I'll be looking forward to it  Yeah  I might be able to beat him up one day  You know  I wouldn't doubt it  You know you're quite put together there Vince  Alright man  It's No Way Out  Sunday  8pm  Pay per view  I wouldn't miss this one  It's going to be good  It would be a riot  Yeah  Alright Vince  Thank you guys very much  Thanks man  Thanks Vince  Nice talking with you 
[02:05:00]  Definitely  Bye bye  There he goes  Vince McMahon  The head lunatic  Of the WWF  The guy is the funniest son of a bitch  You know what it is  No Mario  What is it  You got to understand  I'm so glad you boys like theater  You got to understand  It is theater  I know it is  That's why I'm saying it  I know it is  It is theater  If you take it seriously  For a second  You should be shot in the head  I know that  They have even gone so far over the top  That it becomes ridiculous  It's comedy 
[02:05:30]  It's funny  I do not understand it at all  No  No I really don't  I'd rather have another stroke  Than watch wrestling  I really would  But it's not even about the wrestling anymore  Well you know  Like I said  I'd rather have three more strokes  Than watch wrestling  It's the subplots  It's the soap opera type stuff  That goes back and forth  A lot of great storylines  It's storylines  When they wrestle  It's like alright  They're wrestling  Incredible characters  It's not about the wrestling  Is it okay if you just want to smoke pot  And watch animation  Is that okay  Alright  A lot of TNA  I didn't want to have to pull this out 
[02:06:00]  But men in tights  Alright  Who cares  I do like The Rock though  I gotta say  Do you like The Rock  The Rock says  I like The Rock  I really didn't know  He's the big one though  Right  Huh  You didn't know Gorilla Monson was dead  Who was a close personal friend  Of this  No but I wasn't a mess  I really didn't know  That's the name I remember  That's right  I remember  There was a wrestler we had  On Steampipe Valley one time  And I forget his name  But I think his real name was  Ted Petty  Ted Petty  Yeah I don't know  He was dressed as a cat  And I was like going 
[02:06:30]  I was like going up to him going  Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum  He was like get out of here  Oh Deuteronomy  I was like you'd be riveting in the ensemble of cats  Yum yum yum yum yum yum  Memory  He had no clue  No clue  He was so upset with me  He was really upset with me  I'm just doing musical theater references  He's like  He had like this leopard thing  And I was like  You're like Eartha Kitt's boy  He's like you have a fabulous leather  Um boys 
[02:07:00]  Yes yes Mario Cantone  Okay let me just say one thing  Oh okay  Okay one thing  I woke up the other day  And we were on high alert again  Which is um  Just riveting  You never know  On high alert  And then I  I logged online  I hogged on  And uh  I noticed that  I saw that Nicole Kidman  Was nominated for an Oscar  Yes  That was the high alert  Okay  Did that annoy you  Nicole Kidman  Did you see that piece of crap  Which one is she  Moulin Rouge  Oh Moulin Rouge  Yeah  Do we look like Moulin Rouge guys 
[02:07:30]  No and I'm glad that you're not  Because I'm going to tell you something  It's the worst movie  She's horrible  And she's nominated for an Oscar  It's the worst nomination  Since Ally McGraw in Love Story  It's horrible  I'm so Rex Reed today aren't I  It's awful  What do you think  Who do you think should win  Best Actress  Actress  Holly Bird  Monster Ball  I heard she was great  I didn't see it  I can't even justify  Her being nominated  I heard she was  Did you see it  No  Then you will not judge  I was just guessing  I've seen her other body of work 
[02:08:00]  It's like you don't have to hear  This show  To know it's not going to be nominated  For an Edward R. Murrow award  You know what I mean  She was good in Jungle Fever  Did you like the match  Very good  Holly  She looks hot in swordfish  She was good in the Dorothy Dandridge thing  But you know who's going to win  I think Sissy Spacek is going to win  And I think Denzel Washington  Should and will win  For Training Day  Oh I don't think so  Oh he was awesome  I thought he was one  I mean I didn't like the movie  I thought he was one level  The whole way  He started out bad 
[02:08:30]  He ended bad  And he just delivered dialogue  Well Siskel I disagree  I thought he was riveting  I think he broke the hole to the screen  What about best movie  Picture yeah  Well  I guess  Beautiful Mind  Come on  I hate it  What  That movie  What is wrong with you  Let me just tell you something  I thought that was a great movie  No because you know what  First of all  The guy was bisexual  He beat his wife  Oh okay  There was a lot of stuff  Not enough realism  It's a movie  Not only realism  You know what  I was sitting with someone  Who's dealt with a lot of schizophrenia

Playing Caroline Sunday and Monday here in New York  City, we highly recommend  you go see Mario. He kills  every time.  Jennifer wants in on the  55-gallon drum challenge.  Jennifer!  What's up?  You want to be in the drum?  Yeah, I do. 
[02:15:30]  I figure I can  withstand all that nastiness.  Well, what do you think you could do  if you come down here  before the 55-gallon drum challenge  to impress us and earn  on the right  to get into a barrel?  Yeah, we're  doing like tryouts.  Okay.  Got an idea?  They're called auditions.  Right.  Tryouts, I love that.  It's very football.  I don't even know when it is.  Well, we don't either.  But do you have an idea  to come down to the studio 
[02:16:00]  and do something  in front of us  to show your  gumption and metal?  Um, I don't know  what I can do.  All right.  Well, have you ever done  something really disgusting  in your life?  Yeah.  Like what?  Well, do I have to tell you  now something I can do?  Can I think about it  and then call back?  Yeah, why don't you  call us back  when you figure it out.  But we'd love to have you  try out.  I didn't know I had to do  something to earn the right  Yeah, these are very  special spots  in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We don't want to 
[02:16:30]  just give them away.  It's not going to be that rough.  Just come up with something stupid.  Yeah, we want girls  to just kind of impress us  a little bit.  Let's be real here  for a minute.  And you knew this girl  wasn't going to show up today, man.  The headstand girl.  You know,  if she wants in now,  if that girl that said  she was showing up  and didn't,  if she wants in now,  she's got to take a punch  to the face from all of us.  Unless she shows up.  We'll just punch her  in the face.  I won't punch her,  but I'll do it twice.  Mike Lee will.  Was she supposed to come here  to do the yellow? 
[02:17:00]  It isn't about to go  into the drum too?  Was that her?  Well,  that would have earned  her a spot  when we do this  in the future.  She would have had a spot.  In the industrial strength drum.  Right.  The big drum.  Jennifer,  figure it out  and call us back.  We'll remember that.  Yes, Jennifer.  Okay, thank you guys.  Next week,  we're going to push this  really hard, all right?  Oh, wait till you hear  the prizes, girls.  You're going to be like,  oh, let me get to a phone.  Why did I call earlier?  No excuses to the ladies.  Think about it all weekend,  how you can impress us  to get a spot  in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah, come in and sing 
[02:17:30]  Chicago in a bikini.  Do something.  Something stupid.  Well, as you vomit  on yourself, maybe.  We got to get to  Dice on Ice  or they're going to kill us.  All right, go ahead.  Oh, this is from the Olympics,  of course.  The Olympics, Mario.  Is this something  you're not watching?  No, I know.  The figure skating.  The men's figure skating  done with.  And Russia claimed  first and second  and then our guy there,  Timothy Gable,  came in third.  So we're not doing  too well, huh?  No, we're doing pretty good.  As a matter of fact, 
[02:18:00]  I think the record  for American gold medals  in the Winter Olympics  is 13 and we have 11 now  with about 10 and 9  and 10 days to go.  All right, that's pretty great.  I think we'll beat out  any other previous Olympics.  Mario, we made some...  It's a faggy figure skating  we're not doing too well.  Well, we made some observations.  A lot of gay guys  like the figure skating.  Well, guess what?  I can kill it.  They love the skating.  They love to skate in it.  They love the clothing.  You know,  I like a nice bottle of wine  in the ballet.  But we also noticed  that there was one competitor 
[02:18:30]  who was a straight guy  with a family.  Yeah, a wife and kids.  That's a skater?  He's a male, single...  There are some straight skaters.  Not even the pair skaters.  Sometimes they're like  boyfriend, girl,  girlfriend, husband, wife.  Yeah, very rare.  The pair thing.  Yeah, very rare.  But the single...  The men's single skating...  Yeah.  I have not seen  until last night  a straight guy  that skated in this.  And he's married with kids?  Yeah.  Yeah, the kid...  He's actually retiring  from the Olympics  at 25 to go back to Virginia  and be with his...  He's American, too?  Yeah.  Wow. 
[02:19:00]  And be with his wife  and his two kids.  And he looked Italian and stuff.  Michael Weiss.  He looked very Italian,  very macho.  He looked like a macho.  Why should we do a triple-lux?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  He comes out,  his hair's all done,  like,  don't touch my hair.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going dancing tonight.  That's the only time  I enjoy myself  dancing at the disco.  That's how he looked, though.  Tony Manero.  Yeah.  Look at my big figure  skating ash.  They all have great farts,  I've got to say.  And thought the guy,  you know,  looked a little bit like Dice. 
[02:19:30]  A little out of place.  Is Timothy Gable...  Gable.  Is he gay?  He is what I call  uber gay.  It is gayness  to a new level of gay.  Oh, God.  Awesome.  I mean...  Uber gay.  Don't melt the ice  with the flames.  You know,  years ago in the 70s,  there was a book  called The Front Runner  by Patricia Nell-Wallon,  which was a book  about the first  gay track runner.  Really?  Ran track... 
[02:20:00]  And won the decathlon  and won the sprints  and all that stuff they do.  Well, see,  you don't see a lot of gay guys  in that sport.  No, you don't.  But there are definitely  gay track boys.  No question.  There's gays all over the place.  That's right.  They sprinkle them  in everything.  Gays, gays, gays.  But the skating  is predominantly gay men.  Yeah, sure.  And this guy was very...  And this guy was like,  you know,  straight and sort of macho  until he was doing  some of the weird moves  on the ice, but...  Yeah.  Yeah, he doesn't.  And he was a little bit  flamboyant on the ice.  Well, because they have to have some.  He has some flair.  He's probably a good dancer, too.  He does a triple lutz  that he says to his kids, 
[02:20:30]  you put that knife  in your hand again,  I'm going to stab you  with the spoon.  Yeah.  So, uh, we were thinking  what would, uh,  dice sound like.  A little dice.  Because it kind of was  like an Italian-looking guy.  If he was like a figure skater  in the Olympics.  So this is like dice on ice.  All right?  I'm trying hard.  I, like, you know,  I like the figure skating.  It's a new direction for me.  It's dice on ice.  Yeah, I was a little disappointed  with my performance. 
[02:21:00]  I pulled off the quad,  and then I go into  the triple saw cow.  I can only pull off a double,  but I hit the toe loop.  I hit it.  So I'm scared.  Hey, guys,  what do you think of my...  I went with the gold lame.  I see that dice.  I was going to go with the silver,  but it was a little tacky.  We're watching your performance  right now.  It looks good.  You're skating backwards  right here.  I'm very proud of this move.  Yeah.  See, it comes up.  I do the spin thing.  Oh, hey.  And now, look,  I jumped over there, 
[02:21:30]  but look where I land.  I'm over here now.  I jump over there.  I land over here now.  But there I am.  Now I'm twirling.  I'm very dainty on the ice.  Most people say I'm a big guy.  I'm dainty on the ice.  It brings out my feminine side.  Look at you reaching  for the sun right here.  And now I'm reaching, reaching.  Nice, nice.  And here I go.  Yeah.  Now I go down  into the low leg grab spin.  And look at my head.  My head's flying  like when I call this 
[02:22:00]  the head, the dice camel.  Uh-oh.  It was the hammer camel,  but now it's mine.  Look at you flying  around the ice now.  Now look,  I got some speed up.  I see that.  I go all the way  from over there  to over here now.  Now I'm in front  of the judges.  There's one quad,  a triple,  and a triple.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I pulled that off.  Oh!  Bop!  So I'm skating, right?  Yeah.  And this fag  wants to put his tongue 
[02:22:30]  up my...  Oh!  Oh!  Now I'm going,  look at me backwards.  Look,  I'm skating backwards.  Look at my hair.  And the costume's good.  I wear a lame leather jacket  with dice bedazzled  on the back.  Oh!  Well, it's a little weird  with the sweatpants,  though, dice.  Yeah, well,  the sweatpants help.  It helps with the  atrodynamics.  Oh, you're slowing  it down now.  Now I slow it down.  Here's where I get dramatic.  Okay, very.  Here I...  Now I'm going 
[02:23:00]  for another jump.  I hit that one.  Oh!  The quad!  And now a toe loop.  And now I grab my foot  and spin on the ice.  Look at this.  Look at my hair.  I'm handsome out there.  What?  Do they score for handsome?  Oh, they should.  Now I do something  no one else does.  What's that?  I bring midgets  out on the ice with me.  Watch me jump  the midget.  Oh!  Look at that. 
[02:23:30]  Now I look.  I put my leg  on top of the midget  and he's skating  like he's my leg.  I bend it to the...  Oh, here we go.  Now I go into  an Italian thing.  It's the tarantula song.  Look, look.  I'm skipping on the ice.  You can barely tell  I'm wearing skates.  You're running  on your toes, I see.  Yeah, the other skaters  in the back, they go,  oh, dice,  why do you have to be 
[02:24:00]  so good at skating?  I go, take the C  out of your A.  faggot.  Ow!  Now I'm passing  by the judges.  A toe loop.  A spin.  Give me a perfect score.  Eeeh!  Bump the gold medal.  Smile.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, bravo.  Nice finish.  Thank you.  See how I threw my hands  up in the air?  Very nice.  That's dainty.  Now wait,  I gotta wait for my scores. 
[02:24:30]  You went down  and one knee there.  Very nice.  All right.  Look, instead of  the stuffed animal,  what am I holding?  A midget.  It's in my lap.  A midget.  I wait for my scores.  Uh-huh.  6-0, 6-0,  nice wins.  Oh!  No controversy there.  The French judge  screws me.  I'm gonna plow.  Hey, French judge,  suck my banana juice.  It's dice on ice. 
[02:25:00]  I like the dice on ice.  Very good.  Oh!  I'm having trouble  with the quad.  Hey, Club Soda Kenny,  collect my roses, okay?  Hey, happy face,  get my roses.  The people love me  out on the ice.  Hey, Timothy Gay, boy.  What's with the hair?  What's with the 
[02:25:30]  moosey curly hair?  He don't skate like me.  I'm the best.  And I'm handsome.  See the guy that looks  like the lead singer  of Def Leppard?  No, that's the blonde guy.  Hey, blondie.  You know one thing?  He skates backwards.  The hair looks beautiful.  It's beautiful.  Oh!  I skate unbelievable.  I get the gold medal.  Now it's mine.  Look at my ass  in this outfit. 
[02:26:00]  It's gorgeous.  I like the tight ass on it.  I leave the legs loose  so I can do my jumps.  And the choreography's gorgeous.  I learned that at Pips  when I used to play  there in Brooklyn.  Dice,  someone wants to know  if you're going to consider  pair skating.  What, with like a chick?  Yeah, or maybe a little  of that ice dance.  What, do I lay her down  and put my yam bag  in her face?  Oh!  Score me!  I win!  Bop!  And now the finishing move. 
[02:26:30]  Mule juice on the face.  Pinch the helmet.  Pinch the helmet.  Sok I win!  Oh!  Get me another broad.  This one's full of goo.  She can't skate  with goo in her eyes.  I banana juiced  her eyes shut.  She's skating  into the walls.  She looks like a retard.  Oh!  Uh, Dice in honor.  Dice on ice!  In honor of Dice on ice,  I got a little something 
[02:27:00]  for you here, okay?  Okay.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh!  I'm checking in  from over here.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh!

[02:27:30]  Over here now.  I got a hat, man.  I got your legs.  Okay, terrific.  Don't just stare at it, eat it.  Just look at me like a chick with balls. 
[02:28:00]  He's a jack-o-pitch-point-to-sick.  He's a scumbag.  Nice-y-nice.  I'm over here.  Nice-y-nice.  I'm good like that, my friend.  Good boy.  Look what we did to you again.  Very good.  Drew Boogie.  That's nice.  That's the song going to play when I accept my gold.  I see that.  I step up on the podium. 
[02:28:30]  The gold is mine.  People ask, hey, nice.  What are you going to do after the Olympics?  I'm going to go pro.  You're going pro?  I'm skating around for money.  Yeah.  I got something I got.  I'm working on a thing.  Yeah.  You know the thing?  You're going to help me with the thing?  Are you talking about dice-capades?  The dice-capades.  Like, look at me.  I'm skating with Snoopy.  It's crazy.  Here comes Charlie Brown.  Look, I'm in the cast of Beauty and the Beast. 
[02:29:00]  Hey, Beauty.  Dump the Beast.  I'll dump a load of goo on you.  Dice-capades.  Now it's mine.  Matt has a question for you.  Dice on Ice.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I want to know if Dice is going to be the first person in international competition to pull  off the quadruple plow cow.  Oh, no, no.  You're not stealing that from me.  People do the sow cow.  No.  I do the plow cow.  I bring a fat, disgusting pig on the ice and I plow her on her back. 
[02:29:30]  The judges love that kind of thing.  I'm just plowing a smack in a fat cans as I gently go down the ice.  People go dice.  How are you so dainty while you're banging this fat slob?  You got some other moves there, Dice, or what?  No, I like the quad.  That's good.  And the toe loop.  Yeah.  That's a fun one.  And then I got a new one.  What's that?  It's called the triple boogaloo. 
[02:30:00]  I jump.  It's like a quad.  But as I jump, I go boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo.  I'm over here now.  And when I land, I'm over here now.  I started over there.  I land boogaloo, boogaloo.  I'm over here now.  Oh.  Kenny, get my flowers.  Why is this full of so many faggots?  Everywhere I turn, another fag. 
[02:30:30]  So catch dice on ice in the dice capades.  I got a sponsorship, too.  Cadillac Escalator.  The guy driving.  The Escalator.  The what?  Shut up.  And then my big finish after the boogaloo galoo.  Yeah.  It's to look what I did to you again.  Ow.  Pinch the mule.  Pinch the mule.  Pinch the mule.  And then the banana juice out of my yam bag.  So much. 
[02:31:00]  They got to bring out the zamboni to clear the ice.  Goo all over.  You know that move where you stop short and the ice goes flying on your skates?  I do that in front of the judges with my yam bag juice.  They're covered.  The French judge like she's covered in strudel.  Ow.  Oh, you love it, you pig whore.  All right, dice.  Dice on ice, everyone.

I've been kind of like...  Anything macho?  Yeah.  A little Connie Francis.  How about that?  Oh, yeah.  Connie Francis.  Oh, it was a great Connie Francis movie on Charter Classy 
[02:33:30]  that he's looking for love,  and she's in a red dress,  and she sings,  looking for love.  Jim Hutton,  Timothy Hutton's father.  Mario, you might as well talk to that wall right now.  No, I don't care.  All right.  All right, so listen.  Let's talk about the Oz.  Sinking of big tunes.  Before we talk about Oz,  because we found out during the commercials,  Mario can't tone into the Oz on HBO.  I like the Oz.  Jennifer just called.  She wants to try out for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yes.  She couldn't figure out what to do to impress us.  And now what is she going to do?  She's calling back.  Jennifer.  All right, Jen, go ahead.  Hello.  Hey, go ahead, Jennifer.  How about drinking bong water? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, that would really impress us.  Really, sir.  Drink bong water.  Disgusting bong water.  How much?  I don't know, like a glass full.  Just your standard glass.  That's a bong water.  How about just as much as it is in my bong?  All right.  Well, wait a minute.  You're supplying the bong water?  How do we know you didn't just clean it out and fill it out? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, we'll have someone smell it.  We'll have to take it to the club stinky.  All right, no, we'll make sure it's legit.  Sure, hold on the line so we can work out the details.  Okay, great.  You come down early next week, okay?  All right, thanks, guys.  All right, there goes Jennifer.  She's going to try out for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  By drinking bong water.  Looking for more ladies to impress us.  Think about it this weekend.  Call us next week, okay?  Couldn't you do a nice monologue from Canada Hutchin Rouge?  So Mario is into the Oz.  Yeah, I like Oz.  You watch Oz there on HBO?  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  Well, you know, it took me a while to get into it.  Oh, yeah.  Go, drop the stove.  Oh, yeah.  Get in the shower.  Yeah.  Get in the weight room.  I'm going to shank you.  And he likes Oz, but he has a problem with all the nudity.  A lot of man junk in there.  When they throw someone in the isolation thing, it's just...  It's like, hey, here's my fingers.  C and B's all over the place.  And, you know, if it wasn't such a good show, it might take away some of the straight guy 
[02:35:30]  listeners that are watching.  Yeah, but, you know, I took me a while.  My sister was into it before I was.  My sister Camille.  I was like...  Camille.  She was like, they pull no punches on Oz.  That's an honest show.  They pull no punches.  That's a show.  Oz.  I love Oz.  I'll tell you one thing about that goddamn show.  I would hate...  You get no job security being on that show.  Because even the people you think are going to be around a while, they just kill them all.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:36:00]  But they took that boy in the...  Oh, the last episode.  That's a very good friend of mine, actually.  Mike Dugan.  Really?  Not Mike Dugan.  Michael Doyle playing that role.  Really?  And he's very good on the show.  And that scene where he's in the thing, he's just going,  Fag it!  Yeah, yeah.  And then I was like, I told him, you're going to get yours.  Sure enough, they took him in the closet, and bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  There was no sympathy for that guy.  He was the guy that him and his buddy raped the girl, and then they got sent to Oz.  The other guy that was his buddy that helped them rape, within a day, 
[02:36:30]  he was in the White Aryan Nation in pigtails, lipstick, and a belly shirt.  Forget it.  He was like...  Walking around just sucking.  Completely like, hi, I'm Pippa Longstocking.  Yeah.  It was so ridiculous.  And the other guy was under the protection of Beecher for a while.  Like, Beecher was like, forget it.  But then he screwed Beecher over.  He grabbed him by the head, started going, yeah, suck it, suck it, in the cafeteria.  And then, that was it.  He gave him up to the Aryans.  Well, that's what happens.  Who then took him into a stock room and just gang-banged him. 
[02:37:00]  I can't wait till next week.  Hey, my guy.  My attitude.  It's really...  I've never seen the odds.  He gets a big handful of Axel Green.  Drop the soap.  Come to the cafeteria.  Eat that slop, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Eat the slop.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Schindler on the pool table.  I will use this plastic club, boy.  Schillinger on the pool table.  This plastic club is used for two days. 
[02:37:30]  Serving slop and plowing for you.  Eat the soap.  I've never seen the odds.  He gets a big handful of Axel Green.  Let me tell you, HBO, they're doing...  I mean, you know, I'm on Sex and the City.  Sex and the City, you're going to be on...  I will be back for the season premiere once again next fall.  Yeah.  And I'm doing two more episodes after that.  So, I'm doing free, which I'm so psyched about.  Are they already paid?  They finally figured it out.  No, we start filming in the middle of March.  HBO finally figured it out.  Put shows on that do stuff you cannot possibly get away with on regular TV and do it well. 
[02:38:00]  And brilliantly.  And Six Feet Under is brilliant.  Is that a good one?  Great show.  It's a great show.  One thing I've got to say, where does Arliss fit in on this?  Because that show sucks.  It's the worst piece of...  I hate that show so much.  And I can't stand that guy.  He's the luckiest man in show business.  Why does he keep going?  Uh-oh, Norton.  Robert...  What, did he play for Ozzy at some point there?  He was doing something.  Cobb.  You liked him in Cobb.  He was good.  At Hollywood Nights.  Excellent performance.  Wow, you've got to go back 30 years. 
[02:38:30]  Arliss.  Drop the soap.  Drop the soap.  Sign the contract.  I've got to ask Mario about Sex and the City.  Yeah.  Last season, you kissed a guy.  Yeah, I did.  How was that?  How was that?  It was...  Well, let me tell you something.  First of all, I spent...  I mean, was it weird?  I don't even go to bars.  Let me tell you something right now.  I don't go to clubs.  I don't go dancing.  I don't do that stuff because I never...  I don't care.  I just...  I had to spend 16 hours.  It's not that I'm complaining.  You're agoraphobic, by the way.  I am a little bit.  You are.  And it's getting worse.  I would tell you, you don't...  It's getting worse.  Is it? 
[02:39:00]  I'm turning it to a reason why.  Because now you just like...  You stay in your house and you just don't go out.  I don't like that much.  Look at his fingernails.  He hasn't cut them in months.  I bite the leg.  The curling.  I bite the leg.  But no, I...  Because you only play at Caroline's.  That's it.  I won't.  You won't go to any other places.  I'm sure there's plenty of places you can go.  Come to Dallas.  Well, we're on to Dallas.  Slow down in Dallas.  Come to Atlanta.  Come to...  Come to Arkathon.  They love you in Little Rock.  This is me with like a noose around my neck.  Kill the faggot.  You know, there'll be me hanging from a tree with a strange fruit playing in the background. 
[02:39:30]  No, thank you.  So was it weird kissing the guy?  No, it was fine.  You know, Chris Payne, who is a very sweet guy, he...  Is he a straight guy?  Yes.  And he...  So, you know, I was in this club with all these extras.  It was like being at the Roxy on a Saturday night, which is very gay, for like 16 hours  and then going home alone.  It was a riveting day, let me tell you.  But no, I just kissed him.  That's all.  I had to take my shirt off. 
[02:40:00]  It was horrifying.  Really?  I had to take my shirt off, pull them towards me, and I kissed him on the mouth.  It was all right.  It didn't...  It wasn't exciting.  I didn't care.  And he's a straight guy?  Yeah.  And I hear a couple of those guys on Queer is Folk are straight guys.  They're all straight, except for two of them.  Oh, my God.  Except for two of them.  How do you do with those scenes?  And they're plowing each other.  Right.  I haven't missed an episode.  It's the worst show I've seen you in the episode.  I haven't seen an episode.  I haven't missed one.  It's the worst show, but it's...  Actually, there's some really good performances on it.  I think it's gotten pretty good.  Yeah, performances.  Aural, anal. 
[02:40:30]  All kinds of performances.  Get the soap out.  The house bar.  No lubrication.  Speaking of taking shirts off.  Yeah.  Right.  Just to...  No offense, Mario.  Just to get some of the gayness out.  All right.  Go ahead, Mario.  You know, Oz.  The Breast Fo.  What do we got?  What do we got?  We got a really hot blonde that wants to show her boobies for her plug.  Oh.  Let's hetero this place up a bit.  What do you say, Mario?  What do you say?  Come on.  Let's hetero it up.  Hetero it up.  Get the soap out.  Steve's getting the video camera, which means it'll be up on foundrymusic.com. 
[02:41:00]  This girl's beautiful.  Who is she?  Oh, my God.  Stinky walked in.  I'm like, wow, she's the pig.  Right when he said she's beautiful, Stinky walked in.  Thank you.  Hello.  Look at this girl.  Stinky, you're a great guy, but, you know, as a chick.  Get the soap out.  Hello.  Wow.  Nice.  Hello, darling.  Wow.  You like Mario?  See, they all come to me first.  Of course they do.  They feel safe.  The chicks love Mario.  She smells good, too.  They love him.  Oh, thank you.  You smell lemony and fresh.  Wait, she's got a CD.  No, I'm not the present CD.  We deliver keggers. 
[02:41:30]  Nothing like that.  She's so lemony that I want to wipe the furniture with her.  I'm sorry.  You are very lemon pledge-like.  She's very pledgy.  Blonde, very tall, pretty.  Wearing a belly chair.  And I can tell because you could see through the shirt a little that the placement and consistency  is nearly perfect.  That can mean only one thing.  They're natural.  Very natural.  They are real.  I've had them.  One day I woke up and they were there.  And they were there.  And an uncle was squeezing them.  No. 
[02:42:00]  What about the tongue ring?  When did you get that?  It was six years ago in January.  Okay.  Did it swell or not swell?  The tongue, I mean.  It was very much.  It did, right?  And how old are you?  Right now I'm 20.  20.  So short of a teen.  Why?  Well, we love teens on this show, you know.  No, we like 22.  No, no, no, no.  Perfect.  20 is fine.  Okay.  So what do you do?  I work actually as an x-ray technician.  Oh, really?  And what's the plug all about? 
[02:42:30]  No, I was coming to you with my friend and, you know, my friend said.  You can plug something.  Okay, well, the band is Gravesend.  Yeah.  Are you in it?  I'm not in it.  I'll, like, dance for them and stuff like that.  Really?  Yeah, sure.  Do you have any of their knobs?  No, I don't have any.  It's Opie.  You don't just put it that way.  I was thinking almost famous and all that.  Nah, I grew up with them.  The town, the drummers.  And I grew up with them.  They're my friends.  They're man cool.  And I came here.  Where are they playing tonight?  They don't play anywhere really big.  They've just got a demo together. 
[02:43:00]  It's like Mario's going to be soon with his agoraphobia.  I don't play anywhere.  I sit in my house.  Leave me alone.  They have a website.  I don't know if anybody looks around.  Let's give out the website.  Do they have some music on the website?  They have pictures and stuff.  They might.  Oh, God, Norton.  Jesus Christ.  Put that away.  Norton's eyes are on fire right now.  He works his stuff.  He works his junk the whole time.  And then he has to show everyone.  He pulls the shirt off.  He goes, look.  He gets proud of himself.  That's all right.  He gets a little excited.  We're kind of used to it. 
[02:43:30]  I'll be honest.  It used to bother me at first.  Now it's just Jim and his little pop tent over there.  He's just touching himself.  All right.  So let's see the goods again.  Yeah, there you go.  Are you guys ready?  Oh, we're ready.  Very good.  Wow.  Those are beautiful.  Oh, my goodness.  Okay, this is coming from someone that doesn't care.  Those are beautiful, beautiful breasts.  They're amazing.  Oh, my God.  That's why we say those are really nice, natural breasts.  There you go.  Yeah, 100% nice.  Full D's. 
[02:44:00]  She's like Sharon Tate in Valley of the Dolls.  She's got very, very beautiful.  Full D's.  I think you're the perfect bra size.  That 30-60, I would go for.  Like, Sharon Tate makes me want to choke her and cut her baby out.  What is the sign?  What size are you?  I'm about a 34.  I can fit into a 34 D, but if I wanted to spice it up and make it more cleave and put a C in it.  You can push.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can push it a little bit, right?  Yeah, sure.  All right.  One more show.  You're good.  One more show.  You ready?  You know what, though?  Let me tell you something, and I can speak for everyone here. 
[02:44:30]  When you pull the shirt up and your arms go off a little, it's kind of deceiving.  Could you just remove the shirt and put your arms down?  Oh, yeah.  Bravo, Ed.  Okay.  Just like pull the whole shirt off and then just stand with your arms down.  You are a conniving pedophile.  I know what everyone wants to say.  Hey, I'm not conniving.  You're right out there.  I know.  Mario, don't ruin it.  I'm not ruining it.  All right.  You're not going to be okay.  I don't care.  What do you think I do?  Oh, you're fine.  I'll be totally fine. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, see, now the bra.  That's a little bra.  Wow.  Yeah, she's got the bra.  This does nothing for you, right?  Wow.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Got a little belly button here.  Wait, Mario said wow way.  She looks great.  I've got to tell you.  That's a great part.  Look at her stomach.  Yeah, there you go.  You know what's nice?  I'll tell you.  Keep going.  No.  Keep going.  He's ready?  Yes.  There we go.  He's ready.  He's ready.  Put your arms down after you.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Very natural.  See, that's what we were waiting for.  We have a best boob contest once a year.  Where the hell were you?  You better.  I don't know, man.  I just found out about this stuff. 
[02:45:30]  Right?  Rick comes running in.  Rick almost ran through the glass in the door.  You better join the best boob contest when we have that.  Hey, who's outside?  Rick just got off the thigh machine.  I don't know.  We saw him turn around.  The door's open.  All right.  That's cool.  Those are really lovely.  Thank you.  Aren't they pretty?  They're beautiful.  Yeah, really nice.  Natural's so much better.  Very natural.  Right?  All right.  Give the name of the band and the website and your life story.  Whatever you want to do.  Does it make you mad?  The name of the band is Gravesend.  There she is.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:46:00]  Dan, da, da, da.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to talk into the mic because, you know, the band's listening right now, very  excited.  They want to make sure their website is heard.  Okay.  In the laundry room.  Okay.  The name of the band is Gravesend.  And they're very local.  They play around Brooklyn sometimes.  Oh, wow.  Sorry.  There you go.  Need help there?  The website is Gravesend1.com.  Not O-N-E.  It's the number one.  Okay.  And you guys can check it out.  And I'll give you links.  You can find out about their shows.  Bands, this should be an example. 
[02:46:30]  And if you guys are happy, like, you know, if you think I look good, I'll be there when  they play.  So, any of your fans that...  Will you get topless and wow the crowd, maybe?  It depends.  Bands, 18 cities.  What is your name?  What is your name, young lady?  Lauren.  Lauren.  Look how easy it is, band.  Yeah, really.  Get a chick with real boobs.  What do you think works better?  A pierced tongue on a man orally or a pierced tongue on a woman orally?  To tell you the truth, I think there's a lot of misconceptions.  I think so, too.  I don't think it works very well.  I want some piercer.  I want some metal in there. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, right?  You can take it out of some metal.  Yeah, but for a man, when a man has a pierced tongue, for a woman, that's great.  Maybe, but...  Because the little man in the book is like, hey, I'm playing with my little...  Just lapping.  The only time metal is good is when it's like the end of a gun.  You're in the world.  Thank you, Wilde Menendez.  I want to live.  Let her...  Bravo.  Bravo.  That was a Susan Hayward reference, I think.  Please, the challenge.  Thank you.  I want to live.  You were like the funniest guy.  I'm just so glad I got to meet you.  Well, that's very shaky. 
[02:47:30]  You were very sweet.  You want a hug, Mario?  Mario, would you like a hug?  I'll give her a hug.  There you go.  Look at that.  Squeeze, Mario.  Squeeze.  I squeeze.  This is a copper field.  Copper field.  I am not going to copper field.  Don't be a faggot.  Copper field.  Don't be a faggot.  Copper field.  What's the matter with you?  What's up with you?  What's up with you, man?  What's up with you, man?  What's up with you, man?  What's up with you, like, penis or shantan?  Guys, you're going to start talking.  Copper field.  Get the soap out.  Get the axle grease.  Put them on the pool table.  Get the axle grease.  All right.  You're lovely.  You're beautiful.  Thank you.  Thank you, darling. 
[02:48:00]  JamesN1.com and AOL.  And Mario Cantone's playing Caroline Sunday and Monday.  Caroline.  Check it out.  Very funny.  Let me go to Kevin real fast.  Kevin, what's up?  Kevin.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Honestly, what did I learn?  All right.  I learned that Norton lacks pizzazz.  Yeah.  And also that seeing him rise is a night of pale, meaty-breasted dullness.  Very good.  Wow, that was a good callback, man.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, what's up?  I want to go crazy, guys.  Oh, one more crazy.  Clack, clack, clack, clack. 
[02:48:30]  Go crazy, Brian!  Go crazy.  Look at the crazy whistle I got.  There he goes, Brian.  That was crazy.  That was beyond crazy.  I don't know how long that feature's going to last, Opie.  No, I ain't that.  He was doing machine gun bangs.  Yeah, bang, bang, bang.  We're just about out of here.  Travis from New Orleans.  Today, I learned Norton likes big men in boats. 
[02:49:00]  Jerry from Edison, I learned Vosch finally found a country too polite to tell him how bad he stinks.  Cheap lover, I learned today there's another new bit.  Who's the kookiest kook?  Jersey Gary, I learned today Brittany's only good for the first 20 minutes.  Greta Van Susteren went from lesbian to liberal.  Yellow discipline mixed with love is the best recipe.  Also from dyke to debonair.  Yeah, I like that one.  All the baby turtles don't make it into the ocean.  Dueling cartmans, hilarious.  That was really funny. 
[02:49:30]  Who is that boy?  We don't even know.  He calls from time to time.  Very good.  AOL stands for AIDS Online.  And Norton does neither hilarity songs nor antics.  Plus he's no Madonna, but he does like Spanish men.  And Enigma from Boston.  I learned today that it's England's turn to suffer through the 80s, courtesy of Vosch's routine.  Great.  We got to get, man.  Yeah, that's all we got today.  Thank you, boys.  Mario Cantona, Caroline's on Monday.  Thanks for getting me out of the house.  I appreciate it.  All right, a couple things real fast.  Naughty Nighty Contest.
