<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts defiantly addressing criticism and threats of their firing, using vulgar language.  This led to a discussion about leaked nude photos of Jennifer Aniston, and a plan to distribute copies on the streets of New York, potentially using staff member Danny as a "newsboy."  Legal ramifications were debated, referencing past incidents and precedents.  A call from Jim Norton followed, expressing concern about the potential fallout.  The conversation then shifted to an incident where a fan used an air horn near a news reporter, generating media coverage and prompting discussion on the disproportionate attention given to their actions versus other news stories. The hosts also discussed the legal issues surrounding distributing potentially pornographic material in public.  Listener calls followed, including one from "Jimmy" offering comedic relief, and Doug, a show "pest," who announced a new segment called "Tissue Time" involving on-air phone sex.  The presence of Gray Wolf outside the studio was noted, followed by a call from MySpace Debbie, who bragged about her page and shared a sexually explicit story.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Doug's press release and fan interaction.

The next segment began with excited discussion about a massive Madison Square Garden banner advertising their XM Satellite Radio program.  This transitioned into preparations for their annual "homeless shopping spree," with Keith "the cop" responsible for recruiting participants.  A lengthy and graphic description of one recruit, a man with severely disfigured face likened to the Hulk, ensued, with Patrice O'Neill present in the studio.  Audio clips from Jose, another recruit, were played, detailing his life on the streets, drug use (crack, cocaine, and marijuana), and his need for underwear.  This sparked a vulgar discussion about men's underwear.  The hosts also discussed homophobic remarks related to their banner, played a song by Gray Wolf, and a comedic musical compilation of songs by "Tippy Tom."  Anthony played a recording of his prostate exam, and Opie revealed he had also secretly recorded his.  The segment concluded with discussions of OnStar experiences, the 25th anniversary of John Lennon's death, the shooting death of a man who made bomb threats on a plane (touching on racial profiling and post-9/11 security), and a strip search at San Francisco airport.

The following segment started with a bad joke, followed by discussion of a news story about a passenger shot and killed on a plane.  This transitioned to a discussion of Grey Wolf, who was in the studio. Grey Wolf discussed his homelessness and musical talents, with a song, "Shelter Me," being played.  The hosts arranged a gig for him at the Bellevue Bar and facilitated a donation.  A lengthy negotiation with No Filter Paul secured a guitar for Grey Wolf.  Listeners called in to share their stories and express appreciation for Grey Wolf’s music. Grey Wolf attempted a rendition of "Imagine," and "Half a Hulk Face," a homeless man with facial deformities, was interviewed, discussing his life and medical condition. Al Jorgensen briefly shared a story about blowing up his tour bus.

The final segment featured an interview with Scott, who discussed a disfiguring tumor, its hereditary nature, his need for $3 million for surgery, and his planned appearance at a Grey Wolf performance. A seemingly intoxicated or unstable individual was briefly visible in the background.  The segment transitioned to a lengthy interview with Jose, a homeless Guatemalan man, who discussed his lifestyle, including drinking and his perspective on homelessness (choosing it). He detailed his 92 arrests, including a 90-day sentence for allegedly touching an undercover cop.  The conversation delved into graphic details of his personal life, sexual encounters, and claims of being a "colonel" or "general," believing he could become a billionaire without police interference. He shared unusual childhood experiences, such as showering with his mother and grandmother.  The hosts and Patrice O'Neill reacted with shock, amusement, and disbelief.  The interview concluded with discussion of the homeless shopping spree.  The broadcast ended with discussions of the show’s potential cancellation and a review of a radio advertisement, highlighting its excessive exclamation points. Patrice O'Neill, Gray Wolf, and Eric Logan were mentioned.

[00:11:30]  using to uh have the ability to uh do this type of blah blah blah blah blah monday you two fucking  y'all be oh man uh you know sorry you've never seen this i'm telling you dude it's not just  we didn't see this coming we saw this coming uh once again um looking real bad for the o and a show  child endangerment as o and a shows titties to four-year-olds that they thought was eighteen and a  half but damn they had an id and uh the fuck you're doing that shit like that

[00:13:00]  barker than child we need a new job for danny because he was the he was pretty much the king  of uh the assaults on the media yeah this man right here did more than anybody out there and now  that's it did it the right way so you know it the right way you know what now maybe you should trust  him on it on this kiddie porn uh situation he knows what to fucking do let him go you have to be  you have to look for the willing so basically it's extra extra who wants to see jennifer aniston 
[00:13:30]  topless or or her boobies or whatever all right yeah i think you should find out though obi uh you  should find out if even if he has that material on him is it still considered peddling pornography  you should at least find that out for a young man don't worry about it i don't think there is there  is a law now i read yeah anthony knows the law i read through the law because we we had a problem  with um just laying out material that could be interpreted as being pornographic on the street 
[00:14:00]  that's right uh can i have my parry mason music please that's right uh we had a problem with that  because uh we were told by some police and stuff that was problem the law states that you cannot put  a nude man or nude woman picture laying on the street where it is visible from a car pedestrians on  the sidewalk or even a building an open window out onto the street in public if you cover up the 
[00:14:30]  genitalia or the nipples with those black bars okay still a problem still a problem that's right not  even allowed to do that how about the rape die the rape victim die no you would have to cover the  entire body because if you could still figure out what's going on even though it's blocked out right  there's a problem so if there's a guy and a woman and they're in an embrace and they're nude 
[00:15:00]  and you cover up just their genitals you know that they're having sex all right now i'm playing  the devil's advocate now because you know that you know i've bumped into a cop or two and i'm telling  you there's nothing worse than fuck with a cop and saying and like announcing that you know the law  the law no they don't like they don't like that so i'm just trying to find out now if you say  x3 x3 who wants to see such and such as titties uh-huh jennifer aniston naked yep is that not like 
[00:15:30]  saying hey i got drugs if pornography is illegal to show in in public is it illegal to say is it  illegal to display is it illegal to say i have this no because you're not announcing that you  will be displaying it you're not saying right extra extra hold on stardust music again we gotta make  it official yes it is not illegal because you are not announcing that you are publicly displaying it  this will be a private transaction between our newsboy that's right and a person who is willing 
[00:16:00]  to see this material and of age and let me add we have no muff shots there are no but the breast  shot still is is not uh legal not legal to publicly i just i just i just would i just don't want to  see you guys uh in an emotional whirlwind someone's suggesting uh that uh there's somebody a little  man on the west coast with a chest full of shit right now yelling no and he's on the phone

[00:23:00]  the way there in la let me read the article it's not that uh long not that long at all the headline  opian anthony fan gets an earful over ambush a day after wabc channel 7 correspondent anthony  johnson was ambushed by a fan of the opian anthony show on xm satellite radio a station official said  they're taking precautions to ensure employee safety we're getting reports today that uh they're  doing live shots with cops now and all kidding aside we we've we've ended the assault on the media  uh thing separately the radio host greg opi hughes and anthony cumia told listeners yesterday that 
[00:23:30]  they were calling off their assault on the media campaign saying the incident with johnson had gone  too far it all started tuesday morning when a man walked up behind johnson with an opian anthony sign  and sounded an air horn near the reporter's ear viewers didn't see the incident although they  heard the horn channel 7 is going to do whatever necessary to assure the safety of our crew assistant  news director bill mcfarland said yesterday mcfarland wouldn't discuss whether johnson was injured in the  incident he was not on the air yesterday however new jersey's acting governor richard cody 
[00:24:00]  released a statement tuesday saying the air horn blast could result in permanent hearing damage for the  reporter who was harassed we've heard a much different thing about that by the way uh cody also  said that encouraging fans to intervene in live news shows was inappropriate and dangerous johnson was  reporting on the snow in ocean new jersey during the incident at the time even his on-air colleague  had no idea he'd been attacked indeed after the segment co-anchor steve bartelstein joked about 
[00:24:30]  johnson's hat opian anthony couldn't be reached for comment nice hat  can you hear me now nice hat nice hat opian anthony couldn't be reached for comment i i love that  because no one even tried to get a hold of us uh this appears to be the unfortunate and  irresponsible act of one individual said an xm spokesman we do not condone this act on their 
[00:25:00]  website and on the air opian anthony repeatedly told listeners who they referred to as pests yes  and we love our pests they just got to get a little smarter as we move forward that's well uh  people don't really know little do they know well a pest was on a flight in miami yesterday  and uh that went too far that went a little far assault on air monsters yeah he was pulling wow  stickers from his backpack when they uh what he was actually yelling if i have boss's cd in my 
[00:25:30]  backpack and they yelled bomb then it was a justified shooting  uh so the the pests get i mentioned and uh you know a lot of people talking about our pests lately and  uh they'll get smarter they'll get smarter as we move on mike from ohio notice how jimmy doesn't  call until his job is on the line that coattail riding motherfucker you know what makes me sick  about that comment the fucking fact that i not only is that not the truth but i have a plug to give 
[00:26:00]  do you know how much that hurts if you think that was of course all right let me get past this article  first okay on their website and on the air uh opian anthony repeatedly told listeners who they  refer to as pests not to swear not to get into fights with correspondents or  producers during the campaign it was the same campaign that got a guy in the air  during an arthur chien report at wcbs channel 2 chien frustrated with the commotion behind him  dropped an f-bomb he was fired by channel 2 and now works at channel 11 other stations have faced 
[00:26:30]  the disruptions during live shots though in most cases they've simply pulled away from the shot when  the ona fans turned up the johnson incident however was the first time the fan took it this far  the johnson incident in his statement cody  said the person who committed this act should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law  and there you have it did they arrest the guy that's in the daily news today why doesn't anyone  ask for a they're not going to arrest the guy prosecuted to a partial extent of the law no one 
[00:27:00]  ever asked for like i want him prosecuted just a piece of the law just a chunk a smidgen prosecute just a little bit just a tad  did you find out that the guy was black the report i'm telling you yes significant he was a black guy yeah someone i'm telling you we don't we don't sue  somebody's just this all this shit is my time to needle this motherfucker don't sue don't sue we don't sue hold the phone my friend do you remember a little thing that happened with the daily news and that scratch off fucking lottery thing they did 
[00:27:30]  how come white people remember some shit that nobody black has even heard of now you know you you y'all sold yourself in slavery that's your first thing that fucking thing they had a misprint  you're trying to get reparations from slavery fucking five hundred years ago there you go you're suing for shit that happened you know what when people thought the earth was flat  i'm saying that you got when i asked you was he black it was significant someone's trying to convince them hey ain't your eardrums fucked up man  nah not really let's just go do other black people maybe trying to convince them 
[00:28:00]  trying to convince them  because they want a little piece of the action  they want a little piece of the niggas sue them crackers gotta sue  i think i think footage of a bus accident and that was like it was cam footage from a bank or something  and as the bus was stopped after the accident there were black people running onto the bus  oh shit that's right  it's a claim that they were injured  that's right  why are you so  why everybody's so up on what  they had demonstrations with this daily news problem  daily news put out a scratch off lottery game  uh you scratched off 
[00:28:30]  and apparently they misprinted something  so a whole shitload of people had won like a hundred thousand dollars  right  so the daily news comes out and goes look it was a misprint  it's in our friggin rules that if there's a misprint  it's null and void  you don't win any money  they showed the people demonstrating for their winnings  on a daily basis  and i swear to god there was a one white face in the crowd  not a one  so then they come out and say  alright everybody put  we'll take your tickets  why do you white people demonstrate  white people demonstrate  they don't  like you do  they make calls  right 
[00:29:00]  i demonstrate on the phone  this is a travesty  i want my money  a humorous note to the daily news thing  all the black people that were showing up to protest this and everything  for the scratch off thing  they were told  put your name  send in your losing ticket  and we'll put it in a hat  and draw a winner  for a hundred thousand dollars  oh my god  e-rock won  he was one of the winners  how many winners?  eric won  three or four winners?  there were four winners  how much you win?  and whitey won  a hundred thousand  he won a hundred grand  he won a hundred thousand 
[00:29:30]  he won a hundred thousand  let me get 50  he's still dressed like a slob  he counted an orange with mayo this morning  i've never even heard that story  that's amazing  that's just so amazing  i'm slightly distracted  jeff is  a fucking crack of wind  jeff what are you trying to say today  it says maybe it's retaliation for making fun of his wife  i have no idea what you're trying to say  i know what he means before that  ok  hello  we goofed on his wife  about six months ago  cody's wife was the one with the postpartum depression 
[00:30:00]  they talked about putting her baby in the oven  oh yeah yeah  oh who wasn't making fun of that  there was a jersey station that was making fun of that  that got in trouble with him  exactly  and cody actually threatened that jerk off jersey guy  and challenged him to a fight  so i'm just wondering if that could be why he jumped on this  you know that uh  he remembers you guys crashing his wife  well he'd have to jump on every radio show  because that was a huge story  and i think everybody was calling his wife a kook  yeah when you got audio of some uh  some mother admitting that she wanted to put her children in a microwave 
[00:30:30]  in a microwave because of postpartum depression  of course you gotta talk about that  and now she does uh commercials for postpartum depression  there you go  alright now i got you  i'm sorry  still looks nutty as a fruitcake on those commercials  but she's telling you everything's cool  and where to get  well she's actually telling you how to cook the baby  like don't overcook it  you know you have to bake his little feet  so it doesn't cry  there you go  baste is little  you wrap them in foil so they don't get crispy  and um the thing is because  i'll have a wing  hey henry 
[00:31:00]  oh man  the fucking  the problem with the jersey thing is it's so close to philadelphia  i mean who cares about philadelphia on new year's day  i mean does it matter that i'm going to be at the tower theater  nobody gives a shit  wow i had such time to jump out of the way of that plug  knowing knowing where it was going  that was pretty obvious  it was awesome  so uh new year's eve show  yeah i had to i've got to go to bed  uh i'm doing uh the new year's eve with voss  and and of course my new opening act colin quinn  he's gonna hate you  i can't believe colin's opening for you

[00:35:00]  hey  first time getting through  hey I was flipping through  the channels last night  because I listened to the  replay all the time  yesterday and  Bill O'Reilly replay was on  and Hulu was on there  and that delusional  motherfucker was like  Bill O'Reilly was asking  well what do you get  when you're going to be on  Sirius  and he's like  well what you get is  and this is what was so  ridiculous  it wasn't all the programs  for Sirius first  it was my two channels  first  then all the programs  for Sirius  and then Bill O'Reilly was like 
[00:35:30]  well are you going to use  more cuss words  now that you're going to be  on  he's like  I don't have to do that  to do a radio show  I can do a radio show  and I'm going  you delusional cocksucker  I hope your limo  gets hit by a freaking bus  on the way to work  alright  thank you Paul  very good  he was all over the place  wasn't he  well we did  we did all those interviews  a little over a year ago  and said pretty much  the same stuff  it's the standard  we ought to just  we ought to write a book  we ought to write a book  because there's going to be 
[00:36:00]  a lot of terrestrial radio people  that come over to satellite  it's just happening  it's going to continue to happen  people are miserable  in regular radio  all the jocks  everybody in satellite radio  gets calls on a daily basis  from radio personalities  saying  what can I do to get over there  how can I get into satellite radio  this stinks over here  if we put out a book  with just the statements  that you're supposed to say  during the initial  couple of months  yeah  before you go  we'd be rich  oh that's right 
[00:36:30]  we are  we'd be  don't you get the sarcasm  in my voice  when I say that  no  you're rich  no I'm not  I'm not  how am I rich  I don't know  you saved your communion money  I try to save a little bit  you're right  let's say hi to Nick  I spend  easy come  easy go  I had it  and I went with it  me a bag of shells  he's not going to make it  to 9 o'clock  what  your voice  it's shot  Nick what's going on 
[00:37:00]  yeah I want to back up  a little bit  how come the daily news  can get off with a disclaimer  saying they're not responsible  for what happens  with mistakes and shit  but you guys do  you know you said  don't hurt anybody  and you're not let off  the hook like they are  maybe you ought to  just reword it or something  you know what I mean  well the daily news  gave us a fair piece actually  they usually  the papers usually  trash us pretty good  when we fuck up  so  are they doing the right thing  yeah I think it's alright  it's alright  reword your thing anyway  what the hell  can't hurt  alright Nick  thank you  alright man 
[00:37:30]  bye  this is actually  really really funny  Doug out Doug  one of the pests  what's up Doug  hey good morning fellas  good morning  yeah I was wondering  if you guys saw  the press release  on Tissue Time  with Beth and Allison  yeah you guys are crazy man  this is what I was saying  a little while ago  we still love the pests  absolutely  we support the pests  we just  we're hoping you guys  just get smarter  as we move on  that's alright  just smarter  more clever  more creative  yeah these 
[00:38:00]  the pests  they  they sent out  a press release  that has been picked up  by a few  different places  news organizations  yeah Yahoo News  posted it right  they're sending out  press releases  they do all our  dirty work for us  that's hysterical  we're trying to  we're going to  oh how shall we say  spam the media  in a different light  ah  a spam the media  promotion  yeah there's  there's  I personally  never liked 
[00:38:30]  the assault  on a media thing  anyway  I stay away  from that  I never liked it  that's okay  that was  yeah I'm just  trying to separate  myself personally  from that  so I can keep  doing this  on the radio  right  no you guys  will get smarter  yeah so  there's definitely  a place for pests  on this radio show  definitely  we just  need to figure out  how to make it  a little smarter  that's all  well the press release  I gotta read it  because it's really  really funny man  and I can't believe  they actually printed  this on a  very respectful  website 
[00:39:00]  like Yahoo  the headline  satellite radio fans  treated to a radio first  with the debut  of tissue time  with Beth and Allison  there's the press  press release  it says  New York  December 7th  PR Newswire  in what appears  to be a pioneering  move for the  satellite airwaves  the latest bit  on the XM  satellite radio  Opie and Anthony  show  has listeners  conducting graphic  and uncensored  phone sex  there are plans  to extend the bit  as its own show  every Saturday night  on the XM  high voltage channel 
[00:39:30]  202  reports the program  fan group  ONA Army  the explicit nature  of the show  is perfect  for satellite radio  which is not  limited by FCC  constraints  the concept  of having females  host a show  for listeners  to call in  and have phone  sex with the host  while broadcasting  the calls live  is revolutionary  yes  auditions for the  role of host  will be done live  on the Opie and Anthony  show  when asked to comment  host Greg Opie Hughes  stated  this just goes to show  how hard we work  to put on a quality show  we have so many things  in the works 
[00:40:00]  I think this one  is so brilliant  it is bound  to be ripped off  sooner than later  there's also  a press release  in the works  to publicly dispute  Katie Couric's  report  quote unquote  that Howard Stern  will be the first  shocked jock  in space  hold on  I gotta bow  I have to stand up  and bow  ladies and gentlemen  outside the studio  we've been looking  for him  for two months  it's Gray Wolf 
[00:40:30]  Gray Wolf  Gray Wolf  we got some stories  to tell you  my brother  that's the guy  I still cry  at that song  in my truck  there he is  that's the guy  that wasn't a black guy  that's the guy  we bow to him today  he has no idea  that he's becoming a star  as he walks the streets  homeless  but let's finish up here  yeah you guys are doing  a press release  that you're sending out  to like MSNBC  and all that  yeah we're going to  try to get it out  everywhere  especially the one  about the Good Morning America  and their false reporting  actually it wasn't  Good Morning America 
[00:41:00]  it was the Today Show  yeah Today Show  it was Katie Couric  Katie Couric  basically saying  that Howard's going to be  the first shock jock  on satellite radio  that's just not  that's just ridiculous  so that is  that is currently  being authored  alright here we go  take another angle  and a different spin on this  alright going back  to your press release  on Tissue Time  then it says  Anthony Cumia stated that  the key to the success  of the Tissue Time  with Beth and Allison show  will be that we will  have listeners come forward  and participate  as opposed to trying  to lull the audience  to sleep  to sleep 
[00:41:30]  multitudes of female fans  are excited  at the opportunity  of participating  in this revolutionary concept  women interested  in auditioning  should contact Steve  and they give out  Steve's number  or contact the ONA Army  a fan group  at www.whackbag.com  the Opie and Anthony show  can be heard live  on XM Satellite Radio  from 7am to 11am  Eastern on weekdays  with replays  throughout the day  and weekends  information on Opie and Anthony  and the ONA Army  can be found at  foundrymusic.com 
[00:42:00]  and they picked it up  as a real press release  source  huh?  source  yeah the source  source  ONA Army  yeah  that's awesome  yeah that was penned  by our minister  of morons  Chuck Yarloff  from Whackbag  minister of morons  he's the guy  that got the billboard  going  and all that good stuff  these guys are living  like 1984  oh that's great  the book  the minister of morons  the minister of morons  very good  it's good stuff guys  alright  a lot of people  were asking me questions 
[00:42:30]  the last few days  about you guys  the past  you know  and I completely  support you guys still  without a doubt  I think we just need  to get smart and clever  it's going to be a challenge  for the pests  right  to up their game  we were a little worried  I actually lost  my real job  the other day  and the exact same day  I thought I was going  to lose my job  for the ONA Army  alright  you lost your job  hey  do you guys have  like a $500 coupon  for steaks  you might have  laying around  you're not doing  anything with  we just might  it just might  yeah there's some 
[00:43:00]  unclaimed prizes  outlaw steakhouse  we love them  yeah  am I the 10th caller  today  I don't even know  if we have them  to give away today  but we'll send  some your way  yeah  yeah I've got nothing  Doug how are the  secret missions going  well  you know  I'm not sure  how to proceed  with the one  next week  improvise  adapt  and overcome  that's right  that's right  you guys will figure it out  how's that sound  I don't really know  if we still want to do  that one  you guys  you know  I don't know  someone maybe 
[00:43:30]  could let me know  if that's a good idea  or not  I think if you do it  in a peaceful way  there should be no problem  right  yeah  beautiful  and I'm going on the record  because they might need  this tape  I don't see a problem  if you do it  in a peaceful way  that's what we've been saying  it's always got to be  done in a peaceful way  that's right  that's right  we'll break it down  to it  it's radio shows  I mean you can have fun  act like idiots  but nothing should ever  get that out of hand  where anybody gets hurt  or physical  alright  well thank you Doug  you're all about fun

[00:54:30]  Elise brought a pillow  and a sheet  from her bedroom  and placed them  on the sofa  she'd also brought  her bag of pleasure toys  to choose from  and emptied them  on the coffee table  then we undressed  I'd never seen  Elise in anything  less than brown panties  and was awestruck  by her naked beauty  I told Elise  I wanted to watch her  do her beautiful thing  first  sitting on the sofa  with me  cuddled up next to her 
[00:55:00]  Elise played  with her luscious breasts  and large  dark brown nipples  then she slipped  the hand down  between her legs  to play with her  pretty pussy  she began to moan  and diddled her stiff clit  between her fingers  I felt my own clit  hardening  as I took in  this erotic sight  Elise told me  to stand in front of her  and rub my clit  I stood before her  stimulating myself  as she did the same  mmm  watching you touch 
[00:55:30]  your clit Terry  it's making me  very hot  Elise said  then she plunged  two fingers  into her pussy hole  hearing the wet  sounds of Elise  finger fucking herself  was truly thrilling  a little monotone  isn't it  a little bit  she can't hear us  right now  like she thinks  it's really sexy  like a sultry voice  but it's just  coming off like  monotone  it sounds like  a Barnes and Nobles  books on tape  yeah  what is that 
[00:56:00]  Lord of the Rings  Tolkien Robin  yeah yeah  I don't mind  the fact that  it kind of sounds  like she's reading  as long as it  would be like  a sexy reading  because it would be  very hard to pull off  like she was just  telling a story  oh I'm gonna come  she screamed  her legs  she doesn't have  skills man  you've got to  understand this  she just doesn't  poor thing  watch me  watch me Debbie  watch me come  it was as if  I were watching  the petals of a rose  slowly opening

[00:57:00]  and I was  more than ready  grabbing a  large dildo  and lying down  on the sofa  I immediately  put my fingers  to work  on my aching  clit  and then I  drove three  fingers deep  inside my  dripping love  box  watching you  masturbate is  the best  birthday gift  ever Debbie  it's so  beautiful  Elise  said as she  knelt beside me  I buried the  full length  of the dildo  into my  horny pussy  and began 
[00:57:30]  fucking myself  in less than a  minute I was  crying out to  Elise that I  was coming  and as I lay  with the dildo  still inside me  trying to catch  my breath  I suddenly felt  Elise take hold  of it and began  fucking me  mmm I loved  watching you come  Debbie I want to  watch you come  again  I was quite  surprised by this  and even more  surprised when she  took my clit  into her mouth  Elise oh my  god I screamed  my body  hissing wildly 
[00:58:00]  as Elise fucked  me with the  dildo while  sucking on my  clit  and as I cried  out again that  I was coming  Elise quickly  pulled the  dildo out  and covered  my pussy  with her lips  to receive  my release  I died at  Elise down  on top of  me in a  sick turn  it was the  first time  either of us  had been in  this position  with another  woman  for more  than 20  minutes  we remained  locked in  this incredibly  beautiful love  embrace  each drinking  in each other's

[01:20:00]  to a doctor  you gotta  look at his  fingers now  look at those  fingers  because if it's  like some  big fucking  Italian mook  with those  big fat  sausage fingers  you're not  gonna want to  have him as  a doctor  when you get  to the part  where you need  the prostate  exam  I'm sitting  in the room  it's just  I got a new  doctor  I finally got  a general  practitioner  and I go in  there and I  look at the  sheet that he's  got there  and he's got  a demographic  like you'd  have in radio  you know  18 to 25 
[01:20:30]  25  35  35  45  and you look  at the exams  for the basic  demos  and I look  in my demo  and I see  for the first  time  prostate  and I go  here it  comes  here it  comes  here is  the day  that I've  heard about  from friends  and everything  else  and he saves  it for last  he saves  it for last  and I'm  thinking maybe  I don't need  it  maybe he was  able to tell  by looking  in my ear  or fucking  down my throat  that I don't  need this shit  I was putting 
[01:21:00]  my coat on  and he's like  oh one other  thing  one more  and then the  movie music  starts in your  head  have a seat  Mr. Cumia  no you won't  be sitting  for this exam  matter of fact  don't have a seat  it's just  lean over  the fucking  lean over  the table  lean over  the butcher  paper that I  pulled out  onto the table  my skinny  hairy legs  were shaking  I knew  when he went  for the glove  he like  takes the glove  out  and puts it

[01:35:30]  oh  eric can you  can you make a copy of this for me  oh poor hawk is not happy  what's going on 
[01:36:00]  i get back in  hate to tell you guys  but the show doesn't end  when we go to commercials  no  no it continues  it was up to us  we would just do  four straight hours  so you could hear  all the goodness  well when we come in  in the morning  uh  i uh  i pull up in front now  and uh  master po  thankfully master po  takes 
[01:36:30]  takes my  my escalade  and drives it  to the garage  and then uh  they  they  drive back  in postcards  i guess  uh  one of the guys  will drive  postcard over  po  will drive my vehicle  and then uh  they drive back in the car  and  and i kind of notice  i don't know  i guess i should ask  po about this  or something  but  i kind of notice  little things  are changed  in the vehicle  which is fine  it's nothing big  like the seat location 
[01:37:00]  but that's fine  because he's taller than me  so we'd have to adjust the seat  uh  i know he enjoys  the lumbar uh  feature  which is nice  kind of like a little  back thing  in the uh  the escalator  you get back in your truck  and the lumbar  the lumbar  is like  like i'm doing a back  thing  but po  uh  we've talked about that  in the past  uh  he enjoys the lumbar  i know that  pull up a mic there po  yeah i love your car  you like the lumbar  right on the seat  yeah it's wonderful 
[01:37:30]  yeah i like that  and then uh  uh  i noticed the  but that's cool  because the seat  i get in  and i gotta pull it forward  because you're a tall guy  and you know  that's fine  right  i noticed  i usually have  10 10 wins  or 88  on there  when i come in  so i get all the news  and i noticed  now this drive  mind you  is  probably  45 seconds  it's a  45 second drive  but i notice  sometimes it's on stations  i never go to  so i believe po 
[01:38:00]  is you know  just sampling xm  do you do a little sampling  of the xm  that's fine  the stations are right there  i love xm  i understand that  and that's  i have  i have no problem  with punching around  the thing  uh  you haven't reprogrammed  my home in this uh  navigation system or nothing  so that's cool  no  but now this morning  he comes into the uh  the office to give me  the parking  garage ticket  and goes uh  anthony your car was 
[01:38:30]  talking to me this morning  i'm like  what  he's talking  now i'm thinking  uh oh  that's the first thing  that popped in my head  uh oh  because i  when i noticed that  maybe you're just in the radio  and a couple of things  that there are some vital buttons  up on the rear view mirror  that should never be touched  one is  it's a red cross  and when you hit that  your gps kicks in  and police and an ambulance  are sent to your vehicle  if no one answers 
[01:39:00]  it's it's an on star emergency  or they have the regular on star  where you press and go  hey  where's the fucking denny's  and they'll tell you  where denny's is  uh  and and they'll give you  you know turn by turn directions  to where denny's is  now i  have always feared  that perhaps when poe  was adjusting the rear view mirror  that he'd hit that button  and uh  police and ambulance  would converge on my vehicle  mr kumia  are you sick  yeah  we're not getting an answer  deploy the airbags 
[01:39:30]  there's something  uh  so so  when poe came in  and said  your car was speaking to me  uh  i had a fear  that you would hit that button  no no  i i didn't hit that button  i i was just cold  it's  it's very cold outside  in the morning  now and i am a cold guy  too all the time  let me tell you  you sure are  the heat is always up to 90 degrees  i love it  and blowing full  yeah  so what could you possibly do  to turn it up  i put my heat on the hottest 
[01:40:00]  it could be  i know it's the best thing in the world  he put it up so high  the truck was like  god damn it  we all sweat  the fan  the fan feature came on it  didn't it  a little fan  oh baby  is poe parking this shit  a mint julep comes out of the glove compartment  oh i need a mint julep  it's gonna be warm  oh why are you touching people's shit  i guess 
[01:40:30]  because now there's a button on the steering wheel  that you can press  that goes to the phone feature  now i have a phone  that when you press the button  it goes  on star ready  and then you go  uh call  and it says  uh uh name please  and i say  opie  and it will dial opie's number  and i can talk  it's  beyond hands free  no ear thing or nothing  and i'm assuming maybe you hit that button  well what i did is  i was so cold  that i placed my hands together really tight 
[01:41:00]  yeah  on my chest  and i think  i possibly leaned it  on the uh steering wheel  on the steering wheel  and that could have hit one of the buttons  and then it started talking to me  and the car started  I'd rather listen to music  but you know  i had to subdue the vehicle  it was uh  being boisterous  and mouthing off  i put it in a choke hold  he choked the truck  i choked the truck  you're lucky  you didn't hit the gas  and do a tuck and roll  i assumed  i assumed the trained assassin  was in the back seat 
[01:41:30]  i did what i was trained for  i was trained for this  tuck and roll  the vehicle exploded on impact  i just happened to have a brick  in my back pocket  to put on the gas pedal  wait a minute  then he'll go  you don't have to thank me  anthony  what  did you pull my truck  as i was  tucking and rolling  i thrust my finger  through the gas tank  as it hit the building  and exploded  the potential assassin  in the vehicle  that was speaking to me  was eliminated  you're welcome anthony 
[01:42:00]  you're welcome  you don't have to thank me  thank you for what  you blew up my truck  no no no  i saved your life  you don't have to thank me  i heard the assassin talking  codename on star  i don't know what that means  but  must have been his codename  he calls all the interns in office  oh great  listen you guys  you heard what i did  to anthony  here's the story  well now tomorrow  you're supposed to have  a snow storm 
[01:42:30]  here in new york  four to six inches  and now it's supposed  to be very snowy  okay  on the way  so uh  you are familiar  with the vehicles  the safety features  in the snow  it's got the anti-lock  braking  four wheel drive  uh  you have yourself  some fun there  just try to avoid  any of the uh  you know  any of the uh  he's gonna do  an evasive spin  he's gonna think  just until somebody  follows you in the morning  he's gonna do  a godfather  nice driving 
[01:43:00]  yeah  pat him on the back  nice driving  he's gonna buy  his own truck  just like yours  as a decoy vehicle  uh  we going to jersey  maybe  maybe  put a license plate  that says  quantico  101  let's go to mark  in boston  he has a very funny  on star story  mark what's up  hey how you doing  guys  good mark  hey last year 
[01:43:30]  I was at a Cadillac  dealership  looking at some  new vehicles  and uh  happened to uh  be taking one  for a test drive  brought it back  parked it  and hit the button  playing with the  on star stuff  and I was alone  I didn't tell anybody  didn't think anything  about it  and about uh  ten minutes later  uh the ambulance  and the police show up  uh at the dealership  and nobody could figure out  why  it was cause I hit the button  on the on star  oh man what a pain in the ass  evidently yeah  evidently it's a safety feature 
[01:44:00]  if you hit it  and don't say anything  they send the  yeah they assume the worst  you know  and uh  they send somebody  they were less than pleased  yeah I'm sure  that happens a lot  they were not very happy  I think it happens a lot  is on star always tracking you  like even when you're not calling  they say no  they say no  that you have to hit that button  before they can track you  or listen in on  in your vehicle  cause there have been times  I've hit on star  and uh  I have to  let's say I'm re-upping  uh my minutes  on the  the cell phone  that's built into the vehicle 
[01:44:30]  uh  and there's some kind of an issue  so  uh  they say  Mr. Kumia  we'll put you on hold  and they put me on hold  and I kind of forget  so I'm driving  and I'm blurting out  some nasty shit  you know  at traffic  and uh  they  they can hear me  I'm just fucking screaming  at uh  people in front of me  that aren't being good  that may be people of color  but they can tell  what's wrong with the truck  they can tell  yeah  you know  a light comes on  in your vehicle  like at a check engine  you 
[01:45:00]  you can call on star up  and they'll say  uh  you gotta take it in right away  or you just stop right there  you'll blow your engine up  or  it's not an issue  uh  continue driving  they diagnose it  they know where you are  they're like  uh  Mr. Kumia  we see you here  at the corner of  uh  57th street  and 5th avenue  in Manhattan  like yep  that's where I am  they know exactly  where you are  Jesus  yeah  which is fine  that's nuts  it's a good alibi  or a bad  like  if you're doing some bad shit  do not be driving  one of these vehicles  don't buy a new car  don't buy a new car  guy  no 
[01:45:30]  stopped his limousine  in Queens  on the side of the  Bell Parkway  to get gas  so he goes up to pay  leaves the limousine on  these two guys  jump into the limousine  take off with it  so it turns out  he has on star  so  uh  I call on star  on my cell phone  we're talking to on star  I got the radio in my hand  and they're telling me  yup  it's going 85 miles an hour  down the Bell Parkway  that's some creepy shit  they got off  in east new york  some place  they said  alright  they pulled up  right in front of  this club  they knew the club  that it pulled up  in front of  sent the cops 
[01:46:00]  from the other precinct  over there  and there were the two guys  they were in the bar  hanging out drinking  sitting there  he saw the guys  that jumped in it  yeah  boom  Mr. O'Neill  and it says here  that um  they just  they stopped  they crashed your car  then they walked back  over to you  shook your hand  and you said  thank you  for the insurance scam  and you all hugged  and uh  then you called us  that's it  I don't want that  I don't want that  in my life  I enjoy it  I like  them uh  knowing where I am  if I need to get 
[01:46:30]  someplace  and I uh  pop them on  they'll tell me  where I gotta go  I'm not  I'm not uh  doing any criminal activities  I'm not doing anything  nothing wrong  there's no problem  with them knowing  exactly where I am  at any given moment  I love it  you know I'm paranoid  I love it  shit  that's the difference  between the black man  and the white man  it is  I don't want to be known  the white man's like  I like the safety feature  involved in them  knowing where I am  at any given moment  black man's like  you every ten minutes  you want them to go  Anthony you okay  okay 
[01:47:00]  I'll be like  who the fuck's in my car  fine  just fine Gladys  my own personal  checking up on me  alright Poe  good job  thank you guys  and uh  again thank you  it is greatly appreciated  yes of course  those cold mornings  where I don't want to walk  we should uh  we should get to the story  of the day  well there's two stories  of uh  the day here  25 years ago today  John Lennon shot  shot dead  you're kidding 
[01:47:30]  how did it happen  they're doing a thing  oh no  they're doing a thing  in my neighborhood  did you give Poe  the homeless headphones  you are a prick  that rocks  uh  and then of course  the other story  is uh  what happened on that flight  we got the story here  Miami yeah  44 year old  Rigoberto  Alpazar  had been a passenger  on board  American Airlines  flight 924  when he was confronted  at some point  he ordered threatening  words  that included  uh  a sentence to the effect 
[01:48:00]  that he had a bomb  according to an eyewitness  Alpazar ran down the aisle  flailing his arms  with his wife  not far behind  explaining his behavior  as mental illness  authorities say  he then ran  from the airplane  parked at the gate  after being ordered  by marshals to stop  Alpazar obeyed  but then made a move  for his bag  he remained non-compliant  with their instructions  as he was attempting  to evade them  his actions  caused the fans  to fire shots  and in fact  he is deceased  after the incident 
[01:48:30]  Alpazar's backpack  was found to contain  nothing dangerous  bags related to Alpazar  taken from the  Boeing 757's cargo hold  were detonated  by the bomb squad  no explosives  of any kind  were discovered  in fact  all of the bags  on that plane  were checked  and the plane  later departed  for Orlando  authorities say  this has no connection  whatsoever  to terrorism  yeah  well  kind of in a  in a way it does  like that wouldn't have 
[01:49:00]  happened years ago  right  so it does have  a connection to terrorism  it's the result  of us being terrorized  uh  the guy running up  and down the aisle  of the plane  uh  the marshals  shooting him  like a crazy guy  running up and down  the aisle of a plane  uh  September 10th  uh  2001  ah who cares  they ain't gonna shoot him  I observed the uh  the uh  I observed the suspect  telling me he had a bomb  yeah  I observed  I was watching his 
[01:49:30]  suspicious behavior  and then I was sure  he did it  as soon as he said  I got a bomb  it was something  to the effect of  I'm gonna pull  the trigger  he wanted to kill himself  you know what  I know we have  officers sitting here  but come the fuck on  first of all  he's a Puerto Rican  second of all  no suicide  suicide mom  they didn't know  he was a Puerto Rican  at the time  he could have looked  uh  Middle Eastern  did you see this guy  I see his picture  he looks  he looks  Middle Eastern  he looks  Middle Eastern  yes he does 
[01:50:00]  look at him  that is one of those  Middle Eastern guys  you're insane  you ever pull up  to the gas station  ask a guy  totally white guy  directions  and all of a sudden  they go  you're my friend  you go to  go to  and you go  what the fuck  is that  no  don't try to look  like a white guy  this motherfucker  this guy  looks like a Cuban  man  he does  definitely  oh my god  you know y'all  wasn't supposed to  shoot him  Keith  you know what dude  absolutely  he was supposed  to get shot  yeah  he was non-compliant  and then he reached  into the backpack 
[01:50:30]  what bomber  what bomber goes  aww shit  watch out now  I'm getting ready  to do my bomb  and stuff  they know  he was crazy  do my bomb  and stuff  here it comes  I'm gonna get  my bomb on  I'm about to  get my bomb  and on  I'm about to get  all bomby  up in this motherfucker  it's like a cartoon  here's my detonator  I'm about to get  die hard too  up in this bitch  please  please comply  shoot him in his arm 
[01:51:00]  why y'all have to  kill people  you gotta go  for the big target  we gotta kill one  every once in a while  just to show him  we mean business  that's true  that shows  I say we sacrifice  one every once in a while  just to show  the people that are  looking in  that we mean business  I'll be fair  I'll be fair  to you guys  that's true  that is true  cause a lot of the  weakness that we  that people  they watch a lot  of television  you ever watch  those shows  where a terrorist  goes and says  something like  you can't do  nothing to me 
[01:51:30]  Mr. Officer  you are a  policeman  now you will  arrest me  and I will be  back on the streets  in a matter of hours  and the guy's  holding a gun on him  and his partner  don't do it  don't do it  I'll be following you  for the rest of your life  that cliche  that's what they  think of us  they're not genius  they get the same  info we got  about us  I will agree with you  somebody gotta get shot  it's a sucks to be you  moment  but we're all safer 
[01:52:00]  because of it  just how many years  it's been  and this is the  first guy  first guy  that's really been  shot  like this  in this situation  that's not bad  I think  and me and Patrice  were talking about  this earlier  I don't see  one of these  plain things  like September 11th  happening again  ain't gonna happen  and now  the committee  the commission  that was put in charge  of investigating 9-11  said that  the security in place  isn't adequate  and this that  the other thing  it is  this ain't gonna happen again 
[01:52:30]  and I'll tell you why  not just because of the air marshals  because of the people  the one thing the people had  on those flights  and only  the ones that hit the buildings  was hope  it was hope  that the terrorists  or whoever it was  at the time  that they didn't know  were gonna just  do what they said  take the plane  they watched them  how many movies  it lands  women and children get off  they negotiate  either they storm the plane  you used to get a free vacation  you're hijacked  to some crazy place  those people aren't  flowing back right away 
[01:53:00]  all of a sudden  they show them a beach  and a hotel  for a few days  I'm going to get asylum  in Hawaii  calm down everybody  and I'm telling you  they took over those planes  with the box cutters  because they said  listen  I don't think it was  this is all speculation  but I don't think  it was chaos  on the planes  I don't think  I think it was just  a bunch of guys  going  listen  we just want  an asylum in Cuba  if you relax  no one gets hurt  until the buildings  show up  and that's why  the other flight  that fought  heard about the other 
[01:53:30]  now look at how long  it took  a few minutes  and a couple of phone calls  to the other plane  that crashed in Pennsylvania  for them to realize  uh oh  they're crashing  into buildings  and then their hope  goes away  there's no hope  that this is going  to work out nice  and then they take  the initiative  and start doing stuff  spur of the moment  now  we've gotten to the point  where if  if a maniac  is running up  and down the aisles  the air marshal  boom he's up  if there was no air marshal  on that flight  the fucking people  on the plane  would have tackled  this motherfucker  it's precedent  it's precedent  now it's not going 
[01:54:00]  to work anymore  with a box cutter  or anything you can get  on an airplane  it's just not going  to happen like that anymore  9-11 was precedent  9-11 was like  oh shit  and you're still  going to go like this  as a person  you're going to go  first you go  before 9-11  you go  oh shit  I'm about to go to  I'm about to go to  fucking Israel  yeah  now you go  oh shit  this is how it's going to  do I die  getting shot  right now  on the plane  you take  alright  I'll take getting shot  right now  on the plane  then waiting to fly 
[01:54:30]  into a building  so even if a guy  gets on and goes  alright just relax  man  we're political  refugees  and it's like  nigga  you shit  you're dead  you better have  150 rounds  in that fucking thing  you should have  stayed there  and be able to get them on  because everyone  on this plane  is going to be on you  alright we got a story  from Sal in California  Sal what's up  hey how's it going guys  hey  my mother-in-law  just went to  San Francisco airport  she took a trip  down to Nicaragua  where she's there  right now  but she went through 
[01:55:00]  the metal detector  and she had to get  strip searched  because the metal detector  kept going off  so they took her  into a private room  now give it  granted this lady  is like 60 something  years old  and they're strip searching  her  she's with her older sister  you can imagine  what that's like  you know  yeah it's probably  pretty exciting  for the broad  yeah there's a lot of  places that have  for a whole white woman  to hide shit  just to be honest  you know a couple of  wrinkles  you can get a detonator  or two on a plane  now come on  I mean let's face it  let's be fair now 
[01:55:30]  do you know what  you can fit in a dropbox  come on man  you know those  let's be honest here  those fake Gucci bowling bags  you know them old ladies bring  reminds me of a joke  I heard on XM radio  it's like  what is that  a fuse  holy shit  motherfucker  your joke just flew  into a building  wow  yeah  if some guy's on a plane  with that joke  the air marshal's  shooting it  he's shooting  no one survived  that joke sir  no I'm just reaching 
[01:56:00]  for some funny  don't  after his shot  they realized  there was no joke  in his backpack  they blew up his baggage  anyway  and still found no joke  and no one laughed  alright  Steven Rockland  Steve what's up  yeah you want to talk  about a shitty day  at the airport man  that woman watched  her husband get killed  and had all her shit  blown up the boot  oh my jewelry  yeah can you imagine  you know  fucking awful  alright guys have a good day  yeah that is bad for the wife 
[01:56:30]  you know  she's married to a nut  guy loses it on the plane  gets shot dead  did you see her  and they blow her fucking  Samsonite up  she might be thinking  did you look at her  did you  yeah  a little off  oof  I'd kill myself  a little off  imagine being a passenger  on a fucking plane  because now they take  everyone's bags out  and spread them out  on the runway  they made everyone  leave the plane  from the stairway  with their hands  on their head  you get down there  it's just a fucking wreck  you ever see that  you just think  and it's from Miami  to Orlando  it's not even like 
[01:57:00]  a long flight  right that right  last one off in here  keep the cops sir  it's a flight from Miami  to  there's not enough fuel  there's not enough anything  to do any act  no one blows up  a flight from somewhere else  Miami to Orlando  yeah  don't blow that up  alright  you need a plane  full of fuel  done  let's get Grey Wolf in here  let's say how did the Grey Wolf  hey as we get him situated  from time to time  Nathaniel watches TV for us  and finds some wacky moments 
[01:57:30]  certainly  and we got a news reader  acting wacky  instead of just reading the news  Ant  they gotta  they gotta try to bring on the funny  I'm pre-Lysol  I understand  so  yeah let's get some water  for Patrice O'Neill  hold on a second there Grey Wolf  so really fast  here's a quick clip  of a news reader  trying to bring on the funny  alright  they're also going to be  for the next year  to celebrate the 80th anniversary  of the first publication 
[01:58:00]  of the first  Winnie the Pooh story  there's gonna be a Broadway show  and all sorts of other promotions  so you're gonna be inundated  with Pooh next year  she said Pooh  thank you Dagan  thanks Dirty  have a good day  in this instance  it's totally appropriate  I'm mature  wow  and that's edgy for them  that is  she's nervous about her job  she is absolutely nervous  about that  I said Pooh  I said Pooh  can you come in here Janice 
[01:58:30]  you know  nothing beats  tax cunts  and the Shepard Smith  blowjob  J-Lo blowjob  do we have those  if we could get those  yeah let's play those today  do you got the tax cunts  that's hard to find  I think we lost that  tax cunts  Tom Brokaw  MSU Nightly News  the president's tax cunts  he said it  just like that  knew he said it  knew he said the word cunts  clear as day  and there's a little pause 
[01:59:00]  then he goes back into it  and didn't miss a step  but the pause  was so telling  like  uh oh  I just saw the word cunts  on television  tax cunts  it's so clear  I hope you can find it  I don't know if we have that anymore  Hawk is searching diligently  I think that was one of those things  that we might have lost  damn it  he did the  someone emailed it  he did the  someone emailed it or something  left to right  when he said it  tax cunts  he did  the president's tax cunts  holy shit  oh my god 
[01:59:30]  I'm so fucking fired  ladies and gentlemen  back in studio  the one  the only  Grey Wolf  Grey Wolf  a standing ovation  I'm not standing  but it is a standing ovation  yeah  Grey Wolf  how are you  I'm okay  and you  my friend  are you still homeless  very good  well  just five days ago  I just  lost everything  again  yeah  hurricane  I've been working  no drinking  I was straight up  I met this  fantastic  young woman  we gotta remind people 
[02:00:00]  this guy gets a lot of pussy  man  we've known you for a few years  remember that last time  I brought the girl over  and she flashed you guys  it's the Indian thing  man  the chicks dig that fucking Indian thing  it has to be  what type of Indian  my mom is a Chia Kawapache  my dad's Puerto Rican  and it's pretty cool  it's like  two stones  that sparks up  and the flame  just ended up  in me man  look at that  Indian type 
[02:00:30]  fucking analogy  he just put together  how is  this is  like two stones  unfairness of life  how is this guy  is mesmerizing  and you can see  the genius  that he explained  that analogy  I think people use  analogies of genius  that two sparks  that  two separate stones  that apart  are just  what they are  but brought together  it's a divine spark  yeah  it created me man  it's just like  unique  are you ready to sing today at all?  I can't sing at all 
[02:01:00]  I brought some of my flutes  I could have played something  but  I'm just like  your voice sounds exactly the same  as it always is  it's absolutely  what you got man  on a good day  he's like  hey everybody  on a bad day  he's like  hey everybody  three days ago  I just messed it up  I had a nice clip  but we're thinking  John Lennon  maybe you do a Beatles song  or something for us today  I have  let me see  you could do a little  something something  on the flutes  yeah  I wish I would have brought  the CDs and stuff with me 
[02:01:30]  and some of the music  I could have done  some background music  with that  well don't go disappearing on us  we've been trying to find you  for months  no I wanted to stay  with the station  and I would love to hear  my so famous song  oh yeah  do you remember  recording it?  yeah  I remember  I sung some of the words  like  well you were singing a song  to Tippi Tom  who was in here  now do you have  did you just stop  or do you have more words  to that song  or were you just riffing  and making it up  as you went along  no I actually  I rehearsed all those words 
[02:02:00]  with Tippi Tom  and every time  he was listening to it  he was starting to cry  and it inspired me more  yeah  I said if he feels this way  then these words  are really touching  so you have more words  to that song?  yeah there's a little ending part  oh look at that  I just finished the  I sent my  I sent my truck  I need the rest of the song  everyone has the song  but we need the finish  I cry and I'm not homeless  but I feel homeless  I just gave like  half of the song up  that day  because I thought 
[02:02:30]  you know  maybe just a little piece  to get them interested  gee that was  that was the day  to do the whole song  Harry Wood was suddenly  the stuff  homeless marketing genius  you son of a bitch  he's only giving us  half the story  now we got to take  the second half  get it on pay per view baby  that's like  that's like Kirk  that's like Kirk  going  I only half it smells  like teen spirit  let's go play  half that shit  get the rest  yeah you get the rest  that's all for today  well it really  if you guys 
[02:03:00]  worked that thing up  and made it  like the way  Keith put it to me  it's like  listen man  and the guys  it's the name  I said how they feel  about it  they love it  everyone loves it  dude it's a minute 49  right now  you do the ending  we got something  I'm telling you  we got something  it's genius man  they're already playing it  on the blues channel  throw the chorus in again  I don't have a car with me  or anything like that  another verse and chorus  I don't have the blues with me  I don't have the guitar  you don't even need the guitar  because you got a great producer  behind you  Drew Boogie  really made this song  smoke  well he needs the guitar 
[02:03:30]  probably so he can just  he brought a guitar  yeah what kind of guitar is that  it had six strings  and made out of wood  it had these keys  that you could like  tune in  what kind of guitar is that Danny  that's the  Jägermeister Schechter  that they sent out  right  is it acoustic  it's an electric  but we do have an amp  you can plug in  well no because the thing  the thing is  we probably just want to  mic your voice  right  you can play the guitar  so you can hear it  but we want as little  of the music  mic'd as possible 
[02:04:00]  that way we can then  take it  and Drew can  work his magic  well you know  if we get like a moment  a break or something like that  I can like  work it up a little bit  rehearse it  tune it to my voice  absolutely  well why don't we play  then we make a comeback  and I'll have the ending  but can I hear it please  yes  absolutely  this is what  we really can't take credit  for this  Drew Boogie took what you did  Drew Boogie is genius  who's the Drew Boogie  he's not here today  oh god  but he took your little song  that you did that day  not a little song  it's a very powerful song  it's one of the best blues songs 
[02:04:30]  I've ever heard in my entire life  and the Blues Channel  is playing it here and there  on XM  you should request it  on the Blues Channel  actually they want to interview you  on the Blues Channel  now that we found you  and by the way  one of the friends  had me going to  Bellevue  a bar  up in  here in New York City  when you say Bellevue  and it's like  it must be very crazy  it's like bars  and they're going to have me  come and play  Saturday night

[02:05:30]  what Patrice's face  looks like right now  and he had a marking  ploy  which is  give him a little bit  of a baby  and then  it'll all work  I'm watching a career  on fucking fold  I've not been homeless  and I've been consistently  a comic  for 13 years  and I'm not as big  as fucking  grey goddamn  half a Puerto Rican  wolf  and he has a catch  I don't hold you that  yeah  we have discovered  the next Leonard Cohen  he's sitting right next to you 
[02:06:00]  this is genius  alright here we go  Grey Wolf  Bellevue Bar  9pm Saturday night  we want a lot of listeners  to show up  give the support to Grey Wolf  hold on  Bellevue Bar is at  40th Street and 9th Avenue  alright  yeah  damn I'm not gonna be around  I'd be there in a second  bring as much cash as you can  I'm gonna have a hat  in front of me man  there it is  that way it pays my rent  hey we gotta go there  someone's gotta go to the gig  and tape it  yeah  so we can get some video online  that'd be great  one of you guys  will figure that out right

[02:07:00]  about a man  he always was so lonely  at night  but his voice  was rowdy  you can hear it all  through his train station  and I'm gonna sing  this one  this is about  Sippy told Tommy  let's go  while we go  while we go  it's late last night  and now you have  nowhere to go  my money's gone 
[02:07:30]  and off  for all my friends  and the cop says to me  hey you smell bad  get out of here  and he says  and you don't have any tools  and he says  that is you  shelter me  from the falling rain  you have bones 
[02:08:00]  this is my life  living with so much pain  shelter me  shelter me  from the falling rain  you have bones  this is my life  living with so much pain  just a little piece 
[02:08:30]  see  he set it up at the time  that's a little piece  he had the second part  in his head that day  he should have said  he should have said  sucker  please deposit  please deposit  say it again  oh that's genius  it was just to keep  you know  I knew if I did it like that  I'm going to get somebody  interested  and make sure  that they're going to come out  looking for me  what'd you think of Drew's  what'd you think of the music  Drew put behind it 
[02:09:00]  it's great  that part was  they got homes  yeah  don't you have homes  hey I got a cocktail  napkin over here  could you just sign  right here  just a little signature  and while he was listening  it looked like he was going  I would have added a little more  AP67  yeah yeah  he needs to produce it  yeah this Drew Boogie's okay  but uh  fucking Diddy's gonna produce it  for him  yeah  yeah he's thinking Diddy  let's say hi to Scott in Utah 
[02:09:30]  Scott what's up  hey  what's going on guys  hey Graywolf  yeah  hey that song  when you guys released that song  and Drew Boogie remixed it  I was very heavily into gambling  that song changed my life  I heard that song  and I thought about  the possibilities  of what could have happened  if I keep gambling  and what could possibly go wrong  look at that  can you imagine yourself  getting kicked out of the stations  you're changing lives  I couldn't do it no more  I can't do it no more 
[02:10:00]  that's great  what you go through  and what Tippi Tommy  and hearing that song  I just I can't do it no more  and I just want to think  if I could change one life around  into a better man  I think I've done my job  it looks fine  well you definitely changed mine man  you did your job  you're welcome  and you know what  thanks to Gray Spirit  that gave me this uh  lyrics of  touch people man  you know the most  the best part of it  that gets me  is the cop going  hey you smell bad  get out of here  it's like that's the one  that like makes me go 
[02:10:30]  fuck is that so real  because it is  he's got all this talent  that's all  yeah hey  you smell bad  get out of here  it's like  aww  that brought it like  to a place  you know what I'm saying  we got your producer  on the phone  Drew Boogie everyone  what up people  what's up Drew  hey  genius Drew  genius man  hey  thank you  hey listen  Gray Wolf  I just wanted to say  if you're gonna do it  you gotta do the whole thing  so I can you know  because otherwise  if you do it at a different pace 
[02:11:00]  I won't be able to match it up  with the first part  no I think  I think  the same way I played  I played it there  it's just the way  I like the melody  it's just very gentle  so maybe we can set up  something is that  this song is done  with flutes  like pant flutes  and um  then  I did it with pant flutes  and singing it  and then pant flutes again  and it's like  really great  that part of  can you guys  can you guys do this  in one of our studios  you think  yeah  we can get all that  why don't we get some  studio time  we get Gray Wolf back 
[02:11:30]  we get Drew Boogie  you guys work it out together  he'll redo the whole song  and we'll see what we got  that'd be great  I'm gonna be Gray Wolf  on Saturday anyway  so  alright  you've been listening  yeah Gray Wolf's gonna be  at Bellevue Bar  9pm Saturday night  40th Street  and 9th Avenue  and I'm gonna need a guitar  I don't have one  he doesn't even have a  he's got a gig  he doesn't even have a guitar  I have a friend  that's selling a guitar  for 200 minutes  that's like Patrice  plugging his stand up  and going  hey  someone bring the microphone  this guy is going places  nothing's gonna stop this guy 
[02:12:00]  Drew's gonna bring you  alright Drew  we'll bring you a guitar  it's basically like  in a acoustic electric  I have an app  that I can  I can't tell you  how bummed I am  that I'm not gonna be  in town this weekend  oh god  that's gonna be the  you know what it is  I hope a lot of fans  from the show  go down there  you know what this is  gonna be like  being in a small club  in the village  in the 60's  and seeing Dylan  for the first time  oh my god  that's what it's gonna  be like now  you're seeing  it's the opportunity  to see Dylan  hey wait a minute 
[02:12:30]  Ben that's  No Filter Paul's guitar  fuck No Filter Paul  what  is that his  get us in trouble guitar  well I don't think  he's claiming it  fuck No Filter Paul  we'll give him  stakes or something man  he ain't playing  that guitar  he's not gonna play it  he'll  but Grey Wolf  if we give you that guitar  they're gonna  steal that from you  on the street  aren't they  no they won't  oh yeah they will  yeah they will  they will  because this goes  straight into a place  where I work  you see I have a day job  now  people trust me  I work at the 
[02:13:00]  251  no no no  they don't give out  the address  C Street  what do you do  so they can see me  I deliver money  to the bank  sometimes  you know  I stock up  the beers  maybe you shouldn't  be telling anybody  that's great  he's laundering money  I'm the one  that puts that  people don't trust me  no  what the fuck  I'm not announcing anything  I don't carry money  nowhere  Patrice is boggled  by this entire thing  because it's  he's  he's a genius 
[02:13:30]  right  but I'm like  did it just happen  yesterday  or like  did he recently  become like this  or it's like  if he's like this  his whole life  he's about to be famous  yeah  like he's like  come see me  at the Bellevue bar  but it's like  did he not do that  30 years ago  or he didn't have the voice  or  what the fuck  this was going on  what were you doing  like 30 years ago  yeah  and that kind of fits you  because it's got the  big fucking  stag on the front  someone call  no filter Paul  we want to hand this guitar  over to him immediately  but it really is Paul's 
[02:14:00]  this is gonna be for me  for moi  maybe  we gotta work it out  how many songs  will you be playing  Saturday night  at the Bellevue bar  well I have a track  that I have done  with some of my friends  and I'm using it  to play  the flute music  behind it  I only got like  Carlos Santana's  Europa  that I do with flutes  and the guitar  and I have the song  but I retitled it  and I sung it to my girl  because I didn't know  he was gonna be popular  with the homeless song 
[02:14:30]  and I redid it  with the lyrics  saying  the same in the beginning  but instead of  I have no home  it's like  it's late at night  and I'm on my way home  and an angel of light  appears  dancing in the midnight sun  and that's the way  she appeared to me  and  her name is Mecca  by the way  Jesus  she's just finally  got in touch  with her dad  through the internet  she's been like  away from her dad  since they  you know 
[02:15:00]  personal stuff  that I really  she stayed with me  and her friends  in Queens  and  he put us up  for a while  funny stuff  I had to come back  to the streets  I got her in somewhere else  because she just  she just started working  the way we met  it was funny  I saw this big  white beautiful  Torg  and he's with this guy  with dreadlocks  and I grin  and I said hello  and his name is  Many Pass  he's a traveler 
[02:15:30]  and she has this girl  it's like with him  and  also the next day  they just like  fed him and everything  from the shish kebab truck  and the next day  she was like stranded  and she says  you left me  and I got nowhere to go  and all this  and I said  so come on downstairs  to the train station  I'm going to perform  down there  and make some money  and we'll go here  perform down  two and a half months  she's been with me  and we still  past her friends  we've been going everywhere  we love  come on Mexican restaurants 
[02:16:00]  and stuff like that  there is shit going on  there has not been  any sex in our lives yet  and we've been keeping it like that  as far as we make it  into a special moment  where we feel that it's right  everybody  anybody else  I'd call him a fan  that's my old man  Grey Wolf  I'm right where he's  I'm celibate now  I've been like that  for nine years  my daughter's nine years old  so Barbara and me broke up  first time I went  on the shopping spree  all I did was buy stuff  for my daughter  and my wife  that's right  very much in love 
[02:16:30]  that's why we do the whole  shopping spree  we're doing some good  out there Grey Wolf  and the thing is  I could believe that girls  are doing that  the best part  and I never got a copy  of the picture  Santa Claus  they sat on his lap  she wanted to sit  the girl on his lap  and she says no  she sat on my lap  and when the picture  was ready  she just flashed  and Santa Claus's jaw  hit his knees  and Martha was  like trying to get  a blanket over  it was incredible

[02:34:00]  and I  I just  took a dive  into  out of society  and I lost myself  for 18 years  my family  kept searching  for me  I didn't call  I didn't write  for almost 20 years  they didn't know  about me  or my whereabouts  my brother  is a police officer  and he couldn't  even find me  and I was right  here in the city  just I let my hair  grow  I made it into braids  put a couple of  pigeon feathers  in my hair  and then there  it was  instant Indian  pigeon feathers  my family  could have passed me by  they couldn't even

[02:35:00]  to see you in the west  I promise  six months  and I gave him  four years  of my life  doing a rehab  upstate  that straightened  out my life  for the better  thank you Keith  because that day  was a magic day  for me  I learned about  what the alcohol  was doing to me  and there was  a counselor there  oh my god  he was wonderful  he also cried  and lost himself  into drugs  and alcohol  when his mother  died  so it was like  a perfect  how did he know  my story  I said  and he was like

[02:40:30]  into her  so Gibby's  like  hey man  let's let  these up  on the bus  I'm like  oh that is  so lame  man  we do that  every day  what's wrong  with you  oh I remember  I got this  six foot pyro  on here  so we're in  the back  of the bus  we light  the fangs  and this thing  the guy told me  I remember  the toothless  guy told me  it's supposed  to make  like  a pirate ship  in the air  or something  it's like  it's supposed  to make  this galley  in with  multi-colored  so we light 
[02:41:00]  the thing  in the bus  while we're  rolling down  the highway  between Houston  and Dallas  right  so  we light it  and I'm laughing  I'm laughing  I'm thinking  alright  we're going  to put it  out  okay  I'll light it  and just  freak it  around a little  bit  Greg like  just gets  down on one  knee  at the very  back of the bus  and aims it  for the front  of the bus  that's all you can do  booyah  the thing goes  off  pellets bounce  off the door  and catch  every bunk  on fire  alright  and the great  thing about this

[02:46:30]  going for  yourself there  it's a tumor  it's a tumor  it's not a tumor  it's a tumor  is it one tumor  um  well the predominant  ones on my face  right  but then there's  other ones  uh  smaller ones  smaller ones  yeah  and what are they  like  uh  can they be  removed or  the one on my face  I've had  what 12 surgeries  since I was  probably me  five years old  get out  growing up  the doctor's  excuse was 
[02:47:00]  the reason why  they couldn't  take it out  was  they felt  if they took  out the whole  tumor  that they would  uh  pinch one of  my facial nerves  which uh  which would have  caused me to be  paralyzed  goodbye facial nerves  yeah right  and that kind of  uh  trade off  maybe  yeah  but as I got  older  once medical  science got  actually better  you know  the doctor said  that those nerve  has been  you know  those nerve  had been  gone for years  right  yeah you  kind of  yeah see  because your  mouth  yeah  botox 
[02:47:30]  so that's  the botox  kills  nerves  so uh  what  they could have  taken it out  then  yeah but  it was  it was all  a money issue  which it  which it is  today  it's all  a money  issue  they would  be able  to take  that out  well yeah  if I had  let's say  two three  million dollars  easily  two to three  million  that sounds  like it's  pretty expensive  well the last  surgery  major surgery  I had  it ran  well over  close to  five hundred  grand 
[02:48:00]  that's a  five hundred  thousand dollar  face you got  yep  holy shit  and what did  they do  um  the last  major one  what they did  was the tumor  was about  maybe two  inches away  from my  esophagus  so they had  to go in  there  you know  basically  cut out  most of  the tumor  do like  a  they did  a skin  gram  on the lower  part of my  right leg  to basically  hold the skin  up so that  way it wouldn't  affect my  breathing  if I didn't 
[02:48:30]  have that  surgery I  would have  been dead  already  wow  that is  some fucked  up shit  what  now does  Eric Stoltz  ever call you  and get  mad that  you're stealing  his act  I'm with  the money  from him  now  he stole  my idea  you don't  have a  map  with a  lot  of  pins  on  it  jeepers  jeepers  do you have  share's phone  number  that must  be hard 
[02:49:00]  getting ready  to put  some pins  back in  a drawer  somewhere  it's got  it's got to  be rough  right  you know  I walk  around  goddamn  fucking  kids  pointing at  you  it's got to  be rough  what do you  mean it's got to  be rough  it is  got to be  that's my  preference  if some of  your hand  was on  the left  side  of the  other  hand  like if  you had  a pinky  that was  turned to  the left  off your  hand  people go  oh jeez  man  what the  fuck  happened  his face  is like 
[02:49:30]  a broken  baseball  player's  hand  it's  on the  left  it's  a half  a Hulk  Hulk  right  yeah  half a Hulk  and because  of money  issues  there's  nothing  you can  do  about  it  nope  you better  be able  to sing  shit  Gray  Wolf  can sing  and ain't  nothing  wrong  with his  face  nope  can't sing  worth a lick  and you can't eat  apple  nope  no teeth  god damn  you have no teeth  did that happen  the surgery they did  last year  the surgery they want 
[02:50:00]  to do now  is that they want  to take out  the whole tumor  and  that's a good  suggestion  that'd be a good start  well but the tumor  will actually grow back  why  because  that's a chia tumor  fucking guy  got a tumor  you know what  pretty much  the tumor  the tumor itself  you know  it's like a  it's like a grapevine  the more you pluck off  the more that's gonna  come back  so what  the reason why  they removed all my teeth  was  they actually got a  center  once they removed  the tumor 
[02:50:30]  as I got older  the tumor  actually stopped  you know  caused  the right side  of my jaw  to grow out of place  so they actually  got to break my jaw  you know  and actually  reset it  so my jaw  is gonna be  wired shut  torched  I don't know  how long  and who pays  for this  um  the state  taxpayers  no  I don't care  if taxes  are going  or that 
[02:51:00]  that's fine  by me  I'd rather  do that  than some  stupid  program  that teaches  kids  some stupid  thing in school  they ain't gonna  use  fix the guy's  face  what's your nickname  with all your buddies  they gotta have a nickname  for you  they call me Scott  they just call you Scott  come on  you've heard the names  what do they call you  there Scott  no  all my  all my friends  respect me  yeah  I mean  of course you can have  some assholes  who make fun of me  but  not assholes  your friends  are gonna  look  if I grew up  in the hood  with a face like that

[02:52:30]  fucking tumor  Jesus  gotta get rid of that  tumor  that shit's crazy dude  and then it'll just  grow back  yeah  I mean the tumor itself  is hereditary  on my mother's side  of the family  but the only two people  that's really affected  by it  is me  is me  and my cousin Eric  he had  he had one groin  on the lower part  of his back  he had  two surgeries  then the tumor  bursted  so they actually  had to go in there  and do emergency 
[02:53:00]  surgery  you know  in order to  clean everything out  the tumor  burst  Jesus  that can happen  yep  could it happen  to you  so this is  Christmas  happy holidays  everyone  ain't this a bitch  well you know  you know  growing up  the doctors  told my parents  straight up  that I wouldn't  live to see  my 16th birthday  they figure  sooner or later  the tumor  would kill me

[03:29:30]  Probably BAB with school.  I don't know what they're doing now, but...  Wait, did you get this off their site?  Yeah.  Because, again, look at this.  There's something very subtle at the end of every sentence, which is just horrendous writing once again.  What, the exclamation point?  The exclamation point, Jim loves...  At the end of every sentence.  Jim loves reading things with exclamation points.  So, Jim, why don't you read the bio for Lambert and Lindsay.  Just when you thought it was safe to turn on the radio...  Now, there's three dots. 
[03:30:00]  So, just when you thought it was safe to turn on the radio...  It's the Lambert and Lindsay Morning Show!  Start your morning smart!  Why is there an exclamation point after start your morning smart?  Should there be an exclamation point?  No, it's start your morning smart, but this is...  Start your morning smart!  Mark!  Mark!  I got excited.  That's what happens.  Exclamation point.  Yeah, let's start some more. 
[03:30:30]  All right.  Tune in weekdays with Louisville's fastest-growing morning team!  They're the fastest-growing morning team!  I'm sorry, I'm right in there, I'm probably feeding back.  I get excited, I can't help it.  This is how it is with my head off.  Exclamation point.  I'm just trying to help the listeners, because we get a lot of email that we kill them when  we start screaming right directly into the mic.  Well, I'll do it, I'll read it better.  All right.  Join Linda Lampert, George Lindsay, and Aaron Miller for a great time starting at 5.30 a.m. 
[03:31:00]  every weekday.  You'll cruise through the morning with big laughs, great music, and all the news, weather  and traffic you need.  Weather and traffic every ten minutes!  No station has more weather and traffic in the morning!  No station!  That's because of the exclamation point, of course.  Of course.  Go ahead, Kimmy.  All right.  If you're tired of boring music and boring DJs, you're sick of the same parody songs over  and over, and you want to have fun in the mornings with a live local morning show, then 
[03:31:30]  there's really nowhere else to go but the Lambert and Lindsay morning show on 102.3 The Max!  You really have to scream that because that's four exclamation points.  You didn't read it right.  Wow, look at that at the end.  They put four.  There's really nowhere else to go but the Lambert and Lindsay morning show on 102.3 The Max!  Nowhere else to go!  That is exciting.  Open and 3.  XM2. 
[03:32:00]  All right, we're running out of show.  Patrice O'Neill in studio, doing a great job for us.  He'll be back tomorrow as well.  We still haven't played Gangsta Fag for you.  Someone remind us tomorrow morning, nice and early, before we get into all the craziness  that we need to play that for Patrice tomorrow morning.  Gray Wolf.  He has an update.  Remember that song, the Shelter Me song, and there's two lines that people don't know about?  Gray Wolf, really fast because we've got to get to ELO. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, those two lines it says when the cop says, um, uh...  You smell bad.  Yeah, get out of here.  It's all, it says, and he says, don't you know I got an angel?  And the angel said, shelter me from the pouring rain.  Those are the lines.  So it's like, you smell bad.  Here's the melody.  You smell bad.  Get out of here.  Don't you know I got an angel?  Like, he might smell bad and be completely alone and the cops treating him like shit, 
[03:33:00]  but hey, he's got an angel, man.  He's got someone looking after him, man.  There's somebody there with him.  There's always somebody above.  Smell bad, get out of here.  Get out of here.  Okay.  Maybe the best genius line ever.  That's right.  It's better than Mama Said Knock You Out.  Too legit to quit.  Too legit to quit.  Mama Said Knock You Out and, hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  You know I got an angel.  But you know I got an angel.  That's genius, man.  He's my new favorite guy of all time. 
[03:33:30]  All right, Wolf.  You're going to get together with Drew Boogie and do the full song soon, right?  Yeah.  We got to pray just to make it today.  We'll put it together.  All right.  And Gray Wolf will be appearing at Bellevue Bar, 9 p.m. Saturday night, 40th Street and 9th Avenue.  Okay?  Great.  We got Eric Logan.  Thank you, Gray Wolf.  We got Eric Logan in studio.  All right.  Oh, Patrice and Eric comparing phones.  Most technology is wonderful.  That's nice.  I got a little, yeah.  What do you got there, Elo?  No, this is just the new BlackBerry.  The new BlackBerry.  We saw that yesterday on our tech portion of the program. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, he had the singular one.  This is the T-Mobile.  This is the T-Mobile.  It's singular.  Oh, did you get this?  There's an 8700.  Yeah.  That's not the 8700.  No, this is the newest one that you can get.  You can't buy the 8700 yet.  Ah.  You can't even get the 8700.  How the hell did he get it?  Well, because he's a tech guy.  Because he's a tech guy.  You know, he's got to preview that shit and write up the reviews and stuff.  How's that working for you, that BlackBerry?  Why are you sending that over here?  Good stuff.  The Lysol.  Yeah.  I know.  Believe me.  I don't know what the smell of this place was unbelievable.  It's called haunted.  We interviewed a lot of homeless people. 
[03:34:30]  Don't be afraid to hit that there.  We had guys with tumors leaking.  I mean, we had all sorts of shit happen.  I was wondering why Anthony was wearing a biohazard suit.  Well, I wear that every day.  That's right.  Every day I have this on.  You never know what's going to crawl around on you.  So we almost had Pat O'Brien on the show today.  Yeah.  I saw him this morning, actually.  And I've got to tell you, Elo.  I know you have to ask the question.  Yeah.  Well, people.  Ben comes running in.  He goes, we could get Pat O'Brien on the show within five minutes.  Because the whole Grammy nominations happened. 
[03:35:00]  That's where it was.  Instantly.  We're like, oh, this is great.  This is great.  All right.  You've got to promise you're not going to ask him about the tapes.  Okay.  This sucks.  All right.  It went from great to this sucks.  Because we know we just can't.  He listens to the show.  He just doesn't want to go there.  I mean, he's a friend of mine.  He listens to the show.  In fact, when I saw him, I talked to him after he came back on the air.  He specifically, the second thing he said to me, he goes, hopefully your boys had a good  time with my audio.  Well, I'm glad we can make him happy because we had above and beyond a good time.  I told him he made the first anniversary t-shirt on the top left listing. 
[03:35:30]  That's right.  But the only people who, he's a hero in some circles.  You just go, man.  Let me work on it.  He's just a genius.  Let me work on it.  That guy also got through it with nary a problem.  No shit.  The guy got his job back.  Oh.  He's still hobnobbing with the celebrities.  It's one of the highest rated shows.  Yeah.  The inciders are like insane.  Yeah.  No big scandal or anything.  Like Marv Albert.  You can't get rid of, how can you get rid of Marv Albert?  There's no one else good.  You can't.  So it's like, to be that good, you have to have some type of creepy problem. 
[03:36:00]  Let me work on it.  You can get away with some shit.  Work on him a little bit.  We'll work on him a little bit.  Cool.  All right.  So we may need to make him a regular contributor to the show.  Right.  Well, we survived the latest crisis.  Yeah.  Our listeners are very curious.  Why I'm actually in the studio for an 11 o'clock meeting.  How close were we?  Well, I can certainly tell you Friday at about 4.30.  It's certainly...  Pretty close to the lip.  It was...  We certainly saw that cliff again.  Oh, cool. 
[03:36:30]  You know how you drive up to that cliff and you look down at that giant canyon and you're  wondering...  Well, where's the bottom of that?  Oh, no.  We made it to the other side, unlike Evel Knievel.  Yeah.  We didn't do an Evel Knievel thing.  It was very good.  Well, I'm actually in town today to do a few meetings today.  A little...  A little cleanup?  A little Mindy.  He's going to be mopping a little bit more.  He's the guy that goes into the apartment after the shooting and has to cut the pieces  out of the carpet.  Right.  Harvey Keitel.  Clean the ways.  Yeah, Harvey Keitel.  That's who he is. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  We just shoot and kill and then we move on.  My name's Evel Knievel, but you can call me the Wolf.  We got the...  We'll be cleaning up our mess all day today here in New York City.  Yes.  I have been for the last three days.  Now, pretty please, pull the fucking promotion.  It started off with, maybe we should hold it, maybe we shouldn't, maybe we should let  it rest.  Kill it.  Yep.  I think they had to keep us just because the banner's on Madison Square Garden. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, that contract...  That would have looked real silly.  If our big banner, they fire us and there we are on the side of Madison Square Garden.  Do you want to know something very true?  When I taped The Apprentice, we did that back in May, and I said to my wife, I go, you  know, I at least have a job through the airing of the show because they can't get rid of  me, you know, before the show airs.  Right.  That would just be silly.  Yeah, true.  It would be really silly.  Now the show's aired, I'm a little dicey.  You got to keep something going where you have a little job security.  That's true.  They probably built something into that fucking banner knowing these guys that if we fuck up, they 
[03:38:00]  just pull it like a shade on a window shade and it goes, it just rolls up.  Yeah, it's Bob Edwards.  Yeah, Bob Edwards is right behind it.  Who's the they that can get rid of Eric?  Who's the they that gets rid of you?  There's a board, right?  Yeah, there's a board, and my boss is a guy named Hugh Panaro.  Oh, there is a him that can get rid of him.  Oh, there's a him.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  I'm junior him.  Can't the board even get rid of Hugh?  Like, hasn't it reached that point?  Well, it's a public company.  It's a public company.  Yeah, he's a contract.  You know how these companies work?  The guy that invents the shit, the guy that, like, dedicated his life to making something 
[03:38:30]  gets to a point in companies where the board members could go, I don't like his way he's  running this anymore.  And they vote.  How many votes?  I, I, I, I, I, I, I.  Boom, and you're gone.  You're out on your ass.  And you were the one that started it.  Could be called Patrice O'Neill Incorporated.  Boom.  Goodbye, Patrice O'Neill.  I'm out of my own company.  Yeah, and that's what they do.  They turn around and go, wait, why?  See, and you were complaining that you didn't know how it worked. 
[03:39:00]  Aren't you glad you don't know?  I really don't know how it works.  That's how it works.  Here's what I learned I didn't do, but I learned this in white world.  It's like we have to meld.  White people stand up when they say hello and shake it.  I keep forgetting that if you don't stand up to shake a white guy's hand, he goes, what's wrong with this fucking asshole?  I just thought you were lazy.  That's what it is.  I'm like, hey, what's happening, baby?  It's shipless.  Why should I squeeze out this motherfucking chair just to shake your hand?  I give you love, pat on the back from up here, you know.  But is that black guy or big guy?  That's black guy.  Black people don't go, good to see you. 
[03:39:30]  We give the black handshake sitting down or wherever we are doing.  But white guys get up.  Listen, we'll continue that tomorrow because we've got one minute left.  Oh, shit.  By the way, I want to lose ELO.  I will tell you this.  There was speed round here.  Let's go.  Speed round real quick.  You know, the article this morning, I thought, just to simply put, was absolutely perfect.  I thought they framed the story the right way.  Yeah, we like Huff.  We made the Daily News today.  Huff did a nice job with that.  Really big article on Opie and Anthony and the assault on the media thing that happened.  No, I just, look, I mean, it got out of hand.  I think we had some overzealous fans and, you know, never had the intent. 
[03:40:00]  And you guys made the right decision.  And we had to stop.  Oh, yeah.  It was a decision.  It certainly was.  Decision.  Yeah.  You call it a decision.  That's cute.  It's a decision.  Keep doing the assault on the media.  No paycheck goes into your account.  It's cute to call it a decision.  Oh, what a great corporate meeting choice.  From this horse shit.  Yeah, right.  Right.  Decision.  Oh, fuck.  What decisions did you have?  We're going to keep doing it, motherfucker, even without a radio show.  That's right. 
[03:40:30]  I love that.  These corporate guys.  Everybody has choices, Patrice.  What?  That was a hell of a decision we had to make.  Decision.  Is it a decision if there's only one?  Decision.  No, you have a choice.  One answer.  You know that check that comes in?  Damn.  Put your name on it?  That won't come in no more.  But you decide you want to do this.  And a company can decide not to send it.  Right.  You've got 10 seconds.  What do you got?  I just want to thank all the pests and the fans who have emailed me.  I think there's been 380.  All of them are great.  And I've replied to virtually all of them.  All right.  More tomorrow. 
[03:41:00]  Patrice O'Neill, everyone.  This is me.  Program complete. </pre>
