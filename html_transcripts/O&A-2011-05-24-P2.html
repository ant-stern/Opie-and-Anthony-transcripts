<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The "After Opie and Anthony Live" broadcast, hosted by Sam Roberts with Troy, Roland, and Eric Nagel in the studio (Danny absent due to illness), heavily featured an upcoming fitness challenge between Sam, Eric, and Bobo (with Roland's potential participation).  Significant bets were placed, primarily on Sam defeating Eric.  Eric's perceived lack of commitment to training was a major point of contention, leading to threats of disciplinary action, including firing, should he feign illness.  The segment included a vulgar and insulting mock-recreation of a previous push-up contest highlighting Eric's poor performance.

Beyond the fitness challenge, the show covered Opie's recent, undisclosed birthday celebration; Roland's stressful experience booking Jimmy Fallon, recounted with humorous anecdotes of Fallon's hasty departure; and Troy's financial woes, humorously illustrated by his use of coffee filters as toilet paper. Troy also plugged his DJ gigs.  The broadcast concluded with continued mockery of Eric's fitness and a discussion of an online feud between Sam and Kenny on Facebook.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  You betcha.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live, as the production told you.  I am Sam Roberts.  There's Troy walking up the hallway.  He's probably going to try to get a free plug out of me today.  I should really start charging him for those. 
[00:00:30]  Opie just left this place.  We're all still here.  Danny's out today.  He's feeling under the weather.  But the rest of us are still here cleaning up the studio and whatnot.  Did you notice that Opie was talking about the baby diaper mustache at the end of today's show?  What did we play on yesterday's After Opie and Anthony Live?  The baby diaper mustache.  Now, I'm not trying to say that this show is the pace car that ONA keep up to. 
[00:01:00]  But let the facts speak for themselves.  And you be the judge.  That's all I'm saying.  Just judge fairly, if you will.  Speaking of Opie and the baby diaper mustache, as I said, he was in here up until the last minute right before we went on the air.  And it was odd for him.  And it was mainly because his accountant, I think it was his accountant, I don't know who the guy was, some guy in a suit that doesn't work here, probably his accountant, was waiting outside the studio, just sitting there waiting for him.  And Opie candidly told me, I figure the longer I wait in here, the more likely it is that he'll just walk away. 
[00:01:30]  So, I mean, Erekt, does that sound like something Opie would do?  That sounds like every day.  Tell me the truth.  I saw Troy just walk into your booth.  Does he keep walking by this studio thinking I'm going to give him a plug?  No, I actually think he's working.  He looks aggravated.  Working on what?  Oh, he's cutting up stuff on Pro Tools.  He's not working on anything.  We'll find out what he's working on.  I also want to find out some information from Roland whenever he gets a chance because Roland didn't care that Opie and his accountant or whoever that guy was was out there. 
[00:02:00]  Roland was still pitching guests because as Opie walked off with the guy, I couldn't help but notice Roland following right behind the two of them.  Not Opie and Anthony.  Opie and his accountant yelling out guest names.  Well, he's got to get approval for, I think, a couple of big names.  Who are they?  Can you tell me?  I usually don't like to because Roland gets mad.  Is it Tom Hanks?  No.  Is it Tom Cruise?  Although Roland has a Tom Hanks story. 
[00:02:30]  Is it a good one or is it a Roland story?  No, it's a Roland story.  But he ran into Tom Hanks not knowing that Tom is shooting a movie here in New York City by Central Park.  I would love to hear that story.  You ready for Friday, Eric?  Are you ready for Friday?  What's happening Friday?  You're going to lose on Friday.  Friday is the physical fitness challenge between me, you, and Bobo.  Not only am I going to mop the floor with you, Eric, like literally, and this isn't even  like a personal attack.  Like, I'm going to beat you on every level that a human can beat another human. 
[00:03:00]  I think Bobo is going to beat you, too, with the attitude that you have.  I thought Bobo wasn't in the competition anymore.  Bobo was in the competition.  Since when?  It's me, you, Bobo.  And Roland.  I don't know if Roland's in the competition.  Roland said he was in.  That's why I came in.  Roland, I think Bobo's in the physical fitness competition.  Yeah, Bobo's in the physical.  The whole thing now is between you and E-Rock.  Right.  That's the whole show.  What happened?  I thought...  That sits okay with you, right?  Do you know what?  I came in because you were.  That's the beauty of it. 
[00:03:30]  No, no, I said I did, but then they said they wanted Bobo instead of me.  You understand, Roland, that I'm going to mop the proverbial floor with Eric Nagel.  Where are you going to do the money?  Did you win any money, or...?  Anthony has $200 on me, and if I win, I get $50 of the $200.  That's not fair, but...  Well, it's Anthony's bet.  That's true.  Troy's also got $50 on me.  Also, I was just back there in the other room, and he said he was going to call out sick on Friday. 
[00:04:00]  He did.  I just heard him say it.  You better not do it, because then Jim, if he calls out sick...  That's forfeit.  Jim's not going to pay the money.  Not only is that forfeit, and he'll lose, but he should actually...  If Eric calls out on sick on Friday...  This Friday or next Friday?  This coming Friday.  Is the Facebook all finished?  Yes.  Oh, Flavio Flavio's this Friday.  That's all right.  I mean...  9.30?  9.30.  We can do it before then.  But if Eric calls out sick on Friday, legitimately, and I'm saying this without jest, he should  be fired from the company, because this is a sales promotion that he committed to do last 
[00:04:30]  week.  I didn't commit to shit.  You did.  You said you would do it.  How is that not a commitment?  We're going to have to go back and pull it.  He said he will do it.  You said, yes, I will do it.  On air.  What is not committing about that?  Roland said he was going to do it, and now he's not doing it.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I didn't ask him if Roland was going to do it.  I committed because Roland did it?  No.  You...  I did say I would do it, but then they said they wanted me, they wanted Bobo.  They wanted Bobo instead.  I'm on standby, so if Bobo doesn't show up, I'm in.  Yeah, Roland's willing to do it regardless.  Roland is not the issue here. 
[00:05:00]  Eric, you said you would take me on.  Now, if you're going to call out sick, you're going against your word.  This is a sales promotion, and I don't think it's out of line for me to say that if you  ruin this for not only sales, but for this show, you should be fired.  I mean, it's not like it's the first thing you've screwed up, let's be honest.  I don't think fire, though.  That's severe, though.  You don't think you should be fired?  There needs to be some sort of penalty.  What type of penalty?  Maybe kick somewhere.  You think he should be physically assaulted? 
[00:05:30]  Not physically, just kind of like a tickle rape.  Like a tickle rape.  You have been...  Well, Master Poe once tried to tickle rape you, and you brought up his dead dogs.  They're still dead, wherever he's at.  Good point.  Poe, wherever you're at?  Eric, people are turning against you.  You understand this.  You're supposed to be baby-facing this, and people are turning against you because they  have that little faith in you, that I can sit here and say these horrible things, act  this obnoxiously, and people still think that you don't have what it takes to win. 
[00:06:00]  I'll say this.  The nagle will come and deliver.  You think so?  I think so.  You're betting on him?  I'm betting on Eric.  He'll deliver the donuts.  That's about all he'll deliver.  He's done?  I think he can win, though.  He's not going to win.  I think he can.  Whether it's push-ups, whether it's sit-ups, whether it's running, because there's going  to be power and agility tested.  It's not fair to test only one.  Power and agility should both be tested, right?  When you throw Mars, it's like how far you can throw Mars. 
[00:06:30]  I mean, no offense to Eric, but who?  Because he will be asleep.  He'll wake up his ass.  No offense to Eric, but who would?  Mars should come in here, by the way.  Who would actually think Eric's going to win?  I do.  I honestly think.  I think he could win.  You do.  I really do.  I won't be vet on him.  Jim vet on him.  You want to bet?  Are you willing to wager money?  Wager money?  I just give you enough book.  I know.  I'm not yelling at you.  Don't give me sass.  I'm just asking.  I just scared you.  I'm just asking.  Would you be willing to bet money? 
[00:07:00]  Five dollars.  You'll bet five.  Troy, will you take the bet?  I'll do five.  I'll do 50.  Another 50?  I got 50 with Jim.  That's how much confidence I have in you over Eric.  No offense.  Troy, you don't make a lot of money.  No, I don't.  Sometimes I've had to use coffee filters for toilet paper because I can't afford toilet paper.  That's disgusting.  But I'd be willing to bet $50.  Do you want?  I'll bet you a box of toilet paper money.  I'll have your ass clean. 
[00:07:30]  Eric, do you see the fate that people don't have in you?  I don't give a shit because I didn't want to do this to begin with.  And do you think you're going to lose?  I don't care.  What do you think, though?  If you had to guess.  Or Nazis rape your family.  Well, because some people had to bet on it.  Yes, I will lose this competition.  What type of attitude?  And by the way...  Hey, Sam.  I'm betting on Sammy's sweetheart.  Eric is going to try, by the way.  I want everybody at home to realize this.  I'm betting on Sam, too, off the books.  No, he's not betting on anybody.  Eric is going to try. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  He's going to...  And he's going home, and he is practicing sit-ups, by the way.  I know this to be a fact.  He is practicing.  He is going to try.  He is going to come here on Friday.  He is going to lose.  And then he's going to use this as an excuse as to why he lost.  Because he doesn't have the balls to just say,  Yes, I happen to be a guy who was a born loser, not good at much, and that's who I am.  And it's not an attack.  It's not an attack.  He's going to use this as an excuse.  And he's just sitting there sucking it up. 
[00:08:30]  I'll pay you 50 bucks, Troy, just to go away.  Ouch.  50 bucks?  Give me 50 bucks.  Let me think about it.  Oh, maybe.  Exactly.  Yeah, see?  Goes back on his word again.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, good luck.  Good luck to you both.  Somebody is saying the government puts mind-controlled substances on toilet paper,  and that's why you use coffee filters.  That is true.  To wipe your ass.  That was Jordan in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  Did you hear about the war of words Kenny and me were getting into on Facebook? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, it's all silly.  But he takes that Facebook so seriously.  He's so stupid, that Club Soda Kenny.  Well, it's a big deal to him.  He monitors everything that goes on with his Facebook page.  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  What the fuck?  Check it.  Well, no, I mean, he hooks me up, so I've got to give him a what's up.  Kenny used to hate everything Facebook or Twitter.  He wanted nothing to do with it.  Now that's all he does.  But he realized that the people want to talk to him.  Do you want to do where Kenny goes every Tuesday?  Where?  6-7-5 bar.  What's going on there?  Today's Tuesday.  I'm DJing tonight at the 6-7-5 bar. 
[00:09:30]  Where is it?  Meatpacking District.  Nice.  What is that, like a gay thing?  No.  No, that's just that.  Also, can I mention something else real quick, too?  Is that cool?  Bethlehem, Pennsylvania at the Tally Ho this Friday.  I'll be DJing there.  I looked on your Facebook page.  You've got a lot of dates starting to line up for this DJ thing.  Hey, man.  I'm making it happen.  I remember when you were just a kid with a laptop and a dream.  Dude, I've got to make money, man.  I've got to do it somehow.  I wasn't going to go tonight to the 6-7-5 bar, but I'm going to sing Hangover 2. 
[00:10:00]  So am I.  6-7-5 bar is where?  The Meatpacking District here in New York City.  Come out.  We're having a party.  They have delicious food.  And Troy Kwan is on Facebook.  You get all his DJ dates there.  Go and check him out.  And he likes it when people yell out,  Conspiracy!  While he's DJing.  Bring up the show reference.  Maybe find some toilet paper.  If you're going to go see Troy at the 6-7-5 bar tonight,  bring a roll of toilet paper and give it to him.  He needs it.  He's using coffee filters.  I have.  And also, if someone can bring wipes, then the moist towelettes. 
[00:10:30]  You think so?  It's easier to carry in your pocket so someone can hand it to him.  Well, E-Rock,  you're really not having the mentality that you're going to win, huh?  I don't care.  Let's remind everybody that you once...  Whoa, he just gave me the finger.  Let him give me the finger.  Whoa.  Oh, there it is.  There it is again.  Let me...  Roland, you stick around,  because I want to talk to you about the Jimmy Fallon thing  and how that happened.  But I also want to remind everybody 
[00:11:00]  that E-Rock has been in a push-up contest before.  And like most of the things he's done on this show,  lost.  Okay?  You look at me, you look at Afro Wars,  you look at the Ron and Fez Wrestling Trivia Contest,  you look at any...  basically any contest that I've been in on the show.  Just life.  I've succeeded, I've won, I'm a winner.  That's sort of the standard that I've set.  I have something to plug.  Opie, for listening, please be at the theater by 5.15. 
[00:11:30]  Opie, please, 5.15.  Thank you.  E-Rock, on the other hand,  is Mr. Close But No Cigar.  It's the story of his life,  it's what he was born to do.  Another example of that was...  And E-Rock, you're a good guy.  I'm not saying this to attack you.  You understand that, right?  Don't care.  Exactly.  2007, that was what,  three, four years ago almost at this point,  we had a push-up contest.  I was the referee, impartial referee.  It was Travis, E-Rock, and who else was in it? 
[00:12:00]  Danny.  Danny.  And you and Master Poe.  No, I wasn't in it.  But Poe tried forcing you to get into the contest.  Yeah, and Poe realized that I'm...  Poe is another one who's a born loser.  I mean, where is he now?  Dead.  He's in Florida.  Is he?  Under a different name.  Roberto Rivera.  Okay.  We've probably already said way too much.  He's under Mr. Poe.  Yeah, we've got to get out of this downward spiral  before it gets any worse.  This is the original Opie and Anthony push-up contest. 
[00:12:30]  I will destroy Eric on Friday  on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Push-up till you can't push-up no more.  That's good.  I like it.  Because then we can focus on each athlete.  Yes.  Each athlete.  They should get their backstory.  Oh, the fucking Special Olympics.  What they had to overcome.  Because this abuse should be spread out a little bit today.  Like Travis had to fucking emigrate here  from another country  in a box of swizzle sticks. 
[00:13:00]  Huh?  Confirm what's a push-up.  What are you guys going to do?  Yeah, what's a push-up?  Oh, we go in chest that has to hit the floor, right?  E-Rock, we're giving you a chance  to shut these guys up, man.  I'm pulling for Eric.  This is schoolyard bullying.  You'll have slight bragging rights.  Yeah.  If you can do more push-ups,  you'll have a big bragging rights.  Yep.  True.  Look at Danny.  Danny's stretching.  He's already sweating Guinness.  Danny's nervous.  Danny is sitting to save his energy.  You're finished, Dan. 
[00:13:30]  Danny.  All right, who wants to go first?  Oh, shit.  Travis?  All right.  Travis will do push-ups  until he can't do any more push-ups.  Very slender.  Hey, hey, we'll...  Shoulder width, shoulder width.  All right, this is perfect.  Yeah.  Paul, the only thing we want from you  because you have a tendency  of wrecking bits.  If he's really failing with the push-ups,  you just go, you know, 
[00:14:00]  down a little...  Yeah, but don't...  We'll have Sam count.  We don't need, like,  drill instructor shit.  If there's one or two lame push-ups,  then we'll let it go.  Yeah, let it go, but, you know.  All right, here we go.  Travis.  Travis in position.  There's one, two...  Two, this kid's good.  Three.  Three.  Oh, he's not even tired yet.  Four.  A thumbs up from Poe, by the way.  Five.  Six.  Seven.  Oh.  Eight.  Uh-oh.  He's got a brown sweatshirt on,  a little new... 
[00:14:30]  He's pushing up three pounds.  Eleven.  Don't make him laugh.  Fuck him as well.  Well, be fair.  Grasshopper weight.  Thirteen.  His body's moving really weird  for push-ups, man.  Yeah, it is.  Not fucking the ground.  Sixteen.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  I think Travis is a good fuck.  Eighteen.  Look at him.  Nineteen.  Don't make him laugh.  I know.  Twenty.  It's starting to strain a little.  Is it weird pushing back  without a gentleman behind you?  Twenty-two.  Twenty-three.  All right.  You got to go.  Twenty-four.  Wow.  Twenty-four.  Twenty-four. 
[00:15:00]  Twenty-four.  Twenty-four.  Wow, Travis.  He didn't get 25 up.  He went down on 24.  I'm here to watch you guys.  Yeah.  I want E-Rock to have a fair shot at this.  Fair shot.  He's fucking out, man.  Travis is the champ.  It wasn't even close to a 25th push-up, and Sam's like, ah, it's 25.  No, he was on the ground.  He went 24 up and then down, and that was it.  All right.  Twenty-four for Travis.  Danny's up next.  Go ahead, Danny.  All right, Danny.  Oh, this is not going to be pretty.  One, and he's out. 
[00:15:30]  Two.  He's starting out fast.  Three.  Three.  Four.  Thumbs up from Pope.  Five.  Push-ups look good.  He's already tired.  Seven.  Eight.  Now he's going to have no problem.  Yes, he will.  He's got good form.  Eleven.  He does have bigger arms.  Thirteen.  Fourteen.  He's tired.  Fifteen.  Sixteen.  He just wants to beat that little fairy.  Eighteen.  Nineteen.  Twenty.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  He's tired.  Twenty-one.  Twenty-two.  Hurry up, you girl.  Twenty-three.  Twenty-four.  One more.  One more.  Twenty-five. 
[00:16:00]  Twenty-six.  Twenty-six.  You look like a newborn fall.  That's it.  We can't have him wait too long in between.  Yeah, why don't you just take a nap and come back, shit face.  Twenty-eight.  Can't rest too much.  Can't rest too much.  Yeah, how long are we leaving to rest?  Hey, take 20 and fucking start again.  Twenty-six.  Oh, he's down.  Twenty-nine.  He did 29, but we've got to have a time limit between those waits.  Yeah.  That was pretty impressive. 
[00:16:30]  He can't just stay up there and wait.  I know.  He's got a connecting flight.  He's in the President's Club lounging.  He's holding his heart.  All right, this is going to be awful.  Oh, Jesus.  You know how Eric's done?  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Eric, that's not how you start.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I can't watch this.  To get into position...  Holy shit.  Eric, he wormed into position.  He just like put his arms to his knees and he fucking just wormed onto the ground. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Iraq's going.  That hat's on backwards.  One.  One.  Oh, my God.  Two.  He's so dumb.  Three.  Four.  He's finished.  Five.  Six.  Seven.  He just wants to do ten so he can get laid again.  Nine.  He will never make it to 24.  Ten.  Eleven.  He'll never make it.  Twelve.  Oh, fuck.  Thirteen.  He will never make it.  I guarantee it. 
[00:17:30]  Fourteen.  He's done.  Fifteen.  I'm just going to call it.  Oh, Iraq.  You humiliated yourself.  You humiliated me.  I had my money on you.  Oh, God.  I can't even look at him.  Oh, no.  I mean, and I mean barely fifteen.  Wow.  Open your mouth.  They're paying for it.  Go eat it.  Oh, Iraq. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, God.  I thought you said you were working out.  Oh, it waits.  No, just not hard enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, wow.  Eric.  I'm just going to call it.  You knew he was in trouble when he was getting into position.  He looked like a medical alert button.  He looked like the old lady going down the steps.  I would bet money that he's never done a push-up before.  He had no clue how you even started. 
[00:18:30]  Not since gym class.  When was the last time he did a push-up?  Well, it's been a while.  Yeah.  He's kind of smiling like, yeah.  It's been a while.  Yeah.  It's been a while.  Most people start in the up position.  He was.  He started completely flat on his belly.  In the down position.  Well, because he was hoping just a push-up would count as one.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Very good.  This is how you do a diamond push-up, gentlemen.  Oh, yeah.  The bit's over.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:19:00]  No, it's not out there.  We're sad.  When the bits end on the air, it continues out in the hallway.  That was impressive.  But can you do a diamond push-up?  Sam goes, the bit's over.  And Sam goes like, the bit's over.  I wasn't challenged.  I wasn't challenged.  The bit's over.  Sam, what happened after the push-up contest?  Oh, well, Paul was asking me why wasn't I in the contest.  Yeah.  I said, I wasn't challenged.  Oh, he wasn't challenged.  You know, Iraq wanted to take on Danny and Travis this time, and he needed an official, 
[00:19:30]  unbiased source to count, which is why I was there.  But now Paul is challenging you and saying, you know, let me see what you can do.  Well, yeah, I made a motion like, oh, yeah, I could do push-ups doing this, and then my  hands were close together.  He said, oh, diamond push-ups.  Diamond push-ups.  Now, those are different?  Yes, they are.  Oh, yes.  It's when your hands are shaking.  It's when you put your two pointer fingers and your thumbs together.  That's right.  And it makes a diamond.  The push-ups of the Jews. 
[00:20:00]  My sloppy pussy comments.  I was going to go with sloppy pussy.  And then you do it like that?  Yes.  So you're like, wow, that's got to be hard.  It's very difficult.  Why is that harder?  Let me see.  Leverage.  Yeah.  And, yeah, he said, I'll bet you couldn't do 15.  And I said, sure, I could, because I wasn't actually going to have to do them.  So you might as well just say you can do them. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  I mean, and then he said, do 15 right now.  Me versus you for lunch.  I guess you're saying you bet lunch on it, right?  Sure.  And I was trying to tell him it's not gym class.  I was working for a radio show.  Fucking Sam is the biggest smartass walking around this fucking place.  He's so unassuming.  He knows he didn't get hit.  I know the game.  He is so unassuming and such a smartass fuck. 
[00:21:00]  This is his gym class.  I work for a radio show.  What did you used to do when people, like big kids, walked by you?  Didn't used to...  Oh, in high school?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I hung out with big kids, and I would throw myself against lockers when there  were big crowds, and then fall on the floor and cry because the lockers were...  Oh, you made a lot of noise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you just fall on the floor and cry just out of nowhere, and that way every  girl or sympathetic guy would check to make sure you're okay and call the big guy 
[00:21:30]  an asshole.  You know, if you were a woman, you'd smother your own infants.  After ONA Live.  Get back here, Liam.  Where are you going?  No balls on Liam.  Roland's hanging out.  No balls on Liam the Talent Booker.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts, and throughout the week, we will be chronicling different events that  E-Rock has lost at in preparation for the big Friday showdown, the Physical Fitness Challenge.  Eric just tried to do a push-up, and he's down on the ground, grasping for air. 
[00:22:00]  Is that right?  It's just like when Roland tries to reach his shoes.  Oh!  That's true.  That was a secret.  Asshole.  So, Roland, today was a hectic day for you.  Only one guest, but...  I mean, Jim Brewer ended up stopping by.  Yes.  But, uh, Jimmy Fallon was hectic because it was one of the few times, it happens every  now and then here, where you get a big guest, and they decide to, they, meaning SiriusXM, 
[00:22:30]  decides to fit as much as they can into a very small amount of time.  And they should, that's, that's, that's their job.  But it means that, uh, I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  What it means is that you've got a lot of variables that now, like, for instance, when  somebody's going to be here for two and a half hours, and they're doing five shows, if  one show goes over five or ten minutes, ah, we'll make it up somewhere, it's not that  big of a deal.  When you've got Jimmy Fallon, who's here for about an hour, doing four or five shows, one  of them being Stern, one of them being us, that's a lot more variables to consider. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, he's a busy man, but he said he'll come back, so at the end, we all win.  Um, you were panicking a little bit.  Nah.  I saw you outside that glass.  You were banging on the glass window.  You were pounding.  And it's soundproof.  As if it was a TGI Fridays you were waiting to see open.  I was.  You like TGI Fridays?  I love their little fruit drinks, the pina coladas.  They just like me smile.  But, uh, you were pounding on the glass, trying to get their attention, trying to get them 
[00:23:30]  to let Jimmy Fallon leave the studio.  Jimmy Fallon was having a great time, though.  He was having a ball.  He would stay here all day, but he had a show to do across the street.  And what show?  Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.  Is that what?  No, because he had other shows to do here first.  Yeah, but then he had to run across the street for the production meeting and other stuff.  That's crazy.  Like, I assumed that on a day where he's doing...  He had a 10 o'clock meeting, so that's why he had to literally go from here...  Oh.  ...run across the street, go to production, because they're doing bits tonight.  So they're rehearsing and everything. 
[00:24:00]  We were only supposed to have him for 15 minutes.  That is correct.  We kept him 25.  That is correct.  Was it...  Good for us.  Did it become an issue?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  A little bit?  Nah.  Almost?  Roland greased the palms of the right people.  Did you?  Everything worked out.  Everything?  Yeah.  You're giving me the look like, Sam, everything's good now.  Don't bring up questions.  Because I will attack you. 
[00:24:30]  It's amazing to me that on a day when he's doing all this radio publicity...  At 6 o'clock in the morning, he was on Morning Joe.  Yeah.  So he's literally...  He must have gotten up at 5 in the morning to start doing publicity everywhere for this  little book that he's got out.  Not to say it's diminutive.  It's just a small book.  That he's also still doing his talk show tonight.  Yeah, tonight and then on the 31st, he's doing his talk show, then doing Jon Stewart,  or doing Jon Stewart, then running back to do his own show. 
[00:25:00]  Like, I would assume that he would take his show off on press days.  It's like...  It's like...  It's like the guys, when they're working, they go, we should take off.  But then the man goes, mm-mm.  No.  Oh, I got you.  So somebody...  Let's call him L.M.  Says.  I didn't say that.  Well, L.M. has been keeping him busy because he did Saturday Night Live as well.  Well, over the last two weeks.  Is that what it is?  He's a busy, busy man.  But he seems to like the work.  I mean, listen.  He loves it, but he's a busy man.  I'm also at this goddamn compound for 19 hours a day. 
[00:25:30]  But nobody knows who you are.  That's the problem.  Like, Jimmy Fallon's got a show.  He's doing fun things.  He's got people.  He's on SNL.  He's doing...  Me, I'm just doing all this bullshit for what?  For nothing.  Not really.  I mean, you're doing it for...  Was it the guy filling?  Herbert or whatever?  No.  Newman or whoever the guy...  Actually, I just got a text while that bit was playing.  I'll be filling in for Kid Kelly today on Hits 1.  What about Newman?  Newman's back today.  You've been doing that a lot. 
[00:26:00]  5 p.m. to 9 p.m. today, Eastern Time on Hits 1, is where you can hear Sam Roberts.  Do you fill in for those people and then still do your shift as well?  Yeah, 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.  Wow.  So, what do you do?  Hey, this is Katy Perry.  This is Sam Roberts.  Stay tuned for more Katy Perry.  That's all you do?  No, it's not all I do at all.  It's not what I do at all.  Hey, Mario Lopez might be a father.  No.  On Hits 1.  You know what I do?  I do breaks to say, hey, Mario Lopez.  That's a guy that Roland couldn't book for Opie and Anthony. 
[00:26:30]  Actually, I could, but they said no.  Then they said yes.  Oh, which one of those do you?  Facials all around.  Facials all around.  You love handing out those facials.  I do.  I talked to Opie, actually.  He wasn't here yesterday.  He was at home celebrating his birthday.  He turned 34 years old, and we celebrate his birthday today because we didn't see him.  Eric ate his cake.  Eric, you ate Opie's cake.  We got him a giant cake.  He ate it all.  You're supposed to be in training. 
[00:27:00]  You ate a cake today?  I didn't eat the entire cake.  How much of it did you eat?  Well, there's still half in my fridge.  Oh, boy.  You're supposed to be in training.  This is...  I talked to Opie because we got into a lot of stuff today.  We were talking about Sirius...  He talked a little about being in Philly and SiriusXM not working in his car, but he didn't  really get into how he celebrated his birthday at all.  Did he, Eric?  I was gone for a minute, but...  Nope.  He kept those cards pretty close.  Well, thank God Sam Roberts was on the case.  I could expose. 
[00:27:30]  You could.  Mm-hmm.  What did he do?  I don't know.  You can't.  No.  That's what you meant.  I can't expose.  You're not supposed to call me out.  Thank you.  This is...  I talked to Opie in the middle of the show today.  He went to the bathroom.  So I followed him in there with a microphone to find out how he celebrated his birthday.  He wasn't doing it.  He was doing number one.  How he celebrated his birthday.  Opie, you weren't here yesterday because you were celebrating your special day.  What does Greg Opie Hughes do on his birthday? 
[00:28:00]  What?  Your birthday was yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  How did you celebrate?  How about, where's my gift?  You don't get a gift because you weren't here yesterday.  Didn't you give me the sweatpants one year?  Yeah, but that's because I saw you that day.  You had like a party or something.  The sweatpants that he got really cheap?  Yeah, they were very inexpensive.  That were falling off my body and Steve Blatter told me to pull up my pants?  Legendary sweatpants.  I blame you for that because you bought those sweatpants. 
[00:28:30]  How comfortable were they?  They're very comfortable.  I wear them to this day.  But where's this year's gift?  That made last year very nice.  I didn't, I wasn't invited to any Opie celebration this year.  So there was no occasion for me to gift you.  Oh.  Somebody's got to throw you a party because I'm not just going to show up with a gift.  You, you, you mean, oh.  Oh, I thought, oh, I thought you just didn't show up.  You weren't invited to the party this year? 
[00:29:00]  What party?  I thought you might have had something else going on.  When was it?  Oh, this is really awkward.  When was, you can't, I just assumed you, I don't know, had to get ready for Sam and Dave or something.  I would have skipped it.  Oh, that's why you weren't there.  Oh, it makes sense now.  Don't nagle me on this one.  What?  You're nagling me.  What do you mean?  Well, you stopped inviting nagle places and now I'm not getting the invite.  Oh, he wasn't there either.  What was he, you think?  I'm sure he wouldn't have been invited. 
[00:29:30]  I thought you guys were just mad at me and decided not to show up.  Well, now I am.  Why?  Because now I know I wasn't invited.  Oh, it makes sense now.  You're not on the list anymore.  Huh.  Happy birthday anyway.  He better have been joking.  The party was awesome.  What do you mean the party was awesome?  Last night, the dinner.  What dinner?  The birthday dinner last night.  You didn't go to any birthday dinner last night.  I did.  Where was it?  At his house. 
[00:30:00]  You went to his house last night?  How come I didn't get in?  Eric, is it because, am I too closely associated with you?  That's what happens.  I'm not.  Not with me, with him.  There was pies, cakes.  So you're saying that you get too closely, eventually you get close enough that he just  locks you out?  Yeah, you're running the cycle now.  Oh, I thought I was special.  I'm just on the Nagel track.  No, I'm going the way of, uh, I've gone the way of other people and now you're, you're  following in my footsteps.  Does this mean you're going to be a morning show producer in Philadelphia? 
[00:30:30]  Oof, I hope not.  Roland.  Eat cold potatoes.  Roland.  Yes.  There wasn't really a party, was there?  Yeah.  I'm not like Nagel.  I'm not the type that's going to sit and be okay with not being invited places.  Yeah, it was nice though.  It was a nice bread, some steak, lobster.  Well, I don't like any of that stuff, so.  And chicken fingers.  You're kidding me!  Mac and cheese.  I don't like mac and cheese.  I was at home. 
[00:31:00]  You were?  Yeah.  You didn't get invited anywhere, did you?  No.  A homeless man chased me.  What do you, what, at your house?  Outside, going to get dinner.  I said, he keeps on giving this homeless man money, and then I go, I don't have money.  And then he saw me, and he goes, hey, you got my dollar you owe me?  I go, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  You got your dollar you owe me?  Because you said I'll get you next time.  I said that a bunch of times to him.  And so now he says, well, you're in debt to me now.  You owe me a dollar.  I owe him like five.  No, you don't owe him anything.  Just because you say I get you next time doesn't mean you owe him money. 
[00:31:30]  According to his crazy world.  And then I turn around, and he's like right near me, and I just ran.  I don't know why.  He just ran.  Well, at least he got...  I think I ran fast, but I know I really didn't run fast.  Yeah, he probably had horrible feet.  He's homeless.  Injured legs.  At least he got you moving, though.  On that note, I mean, I miss Ronnie B.  That's how I knew it was always, like, time to wrap up.  But, I don't know.  I think I said something to offend him.  You did?  Or, he's got some kind of problem where he...  I saw him talking to Opie, so I think that's why you're not hanging out with him, either. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, they are...  They're in cahoots.  Conspiring?  Well, wait till Friday when they'll both see that I'm a winner, and they'll want to hang  out with me again.  Oh, yeah, where's he?  Are they off, or...?  No, no, no, they're here.  Pepper Hicks was just around there, around the corner.  Ron and Fez are coming up next!
