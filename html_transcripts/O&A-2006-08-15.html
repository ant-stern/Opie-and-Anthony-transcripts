<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often using highly offensive and crude language.  The show began with a scathing critique of a Chicago Tribune article criticizing syndicated radio, specifically targeting the author, Phil Rosenthal, for allegedly misrepresenting an interview. Opie, Anthony, and James Norton played clips from local Chicago radio shows like "Eric and Kathy" and "Drex in the Morning," mocking the hosts and content with derogatory and offensive comments, often employing racial, sexual, and ableist slurs (targeting a deaf reporter, Karen Meyer).  A listener-submitted weather report for their broadcast markets was also played.

The broadcast then shifted to playing excerpts from a 1961 educational film, "Boys Beware," which depicted homosexual men as predatory.  The hosts interspersed the clips with crude jokes and commentary, highlighting the film's outdated and homophobic viewpoints.  Listener calls followed, with some expressing offense at the content, leading to a discussion about the hosts' intentions.  The conversation also touched upon the "ghost riding" dance craze and Howard Stern.  Tommy Chong was a guest in the studio during this segment, participating in the discussions and recounting his prison experiences, film career, and new book, *Meditations from the Joint*.  He also mentioned his wedding anniversary and his interactions with Cheech Marin and Geraldo Rivera.

The show featured a "walk" segment, where Opie and Anthony interacted with people on the street, including a homeless man whose bag they searched.  Further discussions ensued about "ghost riding the whip," the controversial article on syndicated radio, a humorous listener weather report, and a news story about a man stabbed "in the winky."  They promoted their "Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus" comedy tour and briefly discussed recently-fired radio hosts who encouraged on-air public sex.  A caller won tickets to a Houston show.

A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on the aftermath of the hosts' firing from WNEW-FM for a sex stunt in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  This included a listener's blowjob story, news reports detailing the arrests and the station's apology, and discussion of the FCC investigation.  Opie and Anthony discussed their feelings about the firing, the impact on the shock jock landscape, and their claims of causing a crackdown on other personalities. A contentious phone call with Mancow Muller ensued, filled with insults and accusations, comparing their careers and radio styles.  They also mentioned Sean Hannity and Howard Stern.  Clips from an interview with Bill O'Reilly were played, where they defended their approach to radio and the role of sexual content in their success. Calls with Bob Peters of Morality in Media and the Greaseman offered contrasting perspectives.  The show recounted past stunts, incidents involving their agent, Bob Eatman, and a story about Danny Bonaduce assaulting Mancow Muller.

Finally, the show revisited the aftermath of a "Sex for Sam" contest, discussing the arrests involved,  the show's future, and teasing a "Sex with Sam" segment. This part also heavily featured offensive racial slurs and misogynistic language.  Graphic descriptions and jokes about a middle school teacher accused of molesting students were prominent.  Peter, a media watcher, was a guest, and his commentary on the decline of civility was aggressively challenged by the hosts.  The show concluded with the hosts playfully reiterating that they "don't try to go out with a bang," interspersed with jokes about a gibbon and the teacher's actions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  The most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I could have gone with, I don't know, 20 more seconds of palaver, perhaps.  When he said enough, I'm like, no, I would have liked a little more palaver. 
[00:01:30]  And you know.  Yes.  You know.  I know.  You know, the art of the radio.  The art of the topless.  When I'm doing the topless.  Can't get enough of that.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi, everybody.  Phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, we're all about the free, man.  And we have to say.  One-page radio for free till, you know, you go over to the pay radio.  Yeah, and it's all about pay radio.  And it's all about that.  We're just whores.  Fickle.  Hey, I want to say hi and good morning to Chi-Town.  Hey, Chi-Town.  I call it Chi.  Like the tea?  That way we're guaranteed one of us will get it right.  Phil Rosenthal, you dope. 
[00:02:30]  Phil Rosenthal, writer, contributor to the Chicago Tribune.  The Trib.  Oh, I just call it The Trib.  Chicago's getting a lot of attention lately, and they should.  Because we like Chi-Town.  This guy's an ass.  He interviewed us for, what, over an hour?  Maybe not over an hour.  Close to an hour?  It was long enough, yeah.  Because Chicago's a huge, huge market for the Opie and Anthony show.  And, you know, Chicago Tribune calls you and says they want to talk to you about your show 
[00:03:00]  and coming to Chicago and all that.  We're like, great.  So we talked for an hour, and there's like one quote from Anthony in the whole article.  And it's just to wrap up his agenda he already had for this story when he interviewed us.  They never sit you down and say, hey, I'm doing this story on how local airwaves are losing its identity to syndication.  So we could sit there and then go, hey, but Phil, we're the syndicated show coming in. 
[00:03:30]  So apparently your story's going to be a bit hostile to syndicated programming?  Well, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I will sit for this then.  But instead, he BS's you with this line that it's going to be a story about the show.  We've done plenty of stories about the show when we go into various other markets.  And he asks you a bunch of questions.  He's all smiling.  You could hear him laughing about things as he's asking you and you're telling him. 
[00:04:00]  And he's asking for info that he knows he's never going to use in his story.  So he's wasting your time.  Our time.  And if it's our time, Phil, can we have a little piece on our time?  He should have the balls to just tell us off the bat this is the angle he's taking.  What do you really think about his stuff?  And at least that way we can come across and talk about the story he wants to do.  Instead, he's like, so how did you guys mean?  And we give him an answer that's kind of funny. 
[00:04:30]  He's like, ha ha.  And you hear this in the background.  A little typing, yeah.  Typing going on.  Oh, okay.  I think that's going to make the article good.  Good stuff here.  But he talks about how, you know, syndicated radio is not good for Chicago.  But if you're in a top ten market where there's someone who's very good who's also sitting there going,  boy, it's a beautiful day, or oh, my gosh, look how hard it's raining today,  that's liable to be more popular than someone in another market who's going, 
[00:05:00]  hi, Chi-Town, how's it going?  That's the difference.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you made your point there.  For some reason.  A local show that's able to tell you when the rain actually hits.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that's why I tune in the radio.  Instead of looking out the window or seeing if your windshield wipers are on.  Did you turn your wipers on when you hit the gas this morning?  It's raining.  Look, we'll be honest with you.  I don't know.  It could be raining in Chicago right now.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  And guess what?  Yeah, we don't care. 
[00:05:30]  Nor do the people there care about hearing about it on their radio.  Because they already know themselves.  They have this thing, these writers and media insiders,  that for some reason have you people in Chicago penned up in this zoo of people  that cannot look outside your own city.  They truly believe that if it's not from Chicago, it can't be good.  That's so stupid.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:06:00]  And how this show works, we'll find our own audience in Chicago.  That's what we'll do.  We will find people that enjoy what we do.  They will become Opie and Anthony listeners.  It doesn't matter if they're from Chicago or Providence or New York City.  We don't dedicate the show to the city we're in.  We don't dedicate it to New York.  We don't dedicate it to Philly, yeah, or any of the other stations we're in.  It's crap everywhere.  Albuquerque.  We broadcast live from New York.  Tucson.  We're barely local as far as New York goes.  Yeah.  Barely.  This show is just about whatever the hell we want to BS about on a daily basis, 
[00:06:30]  regardless of where we are geographically.  When I'm laughing at something I'm listening to, I'm never wondering where it's coming from.  But where is it coming?  What city?  I might not be laughing if I find out where this is from.  Is it in my city?  My hometown?  Schmuck.  In front of me.  Unless it's from, like, Beirut.  I doubt I'd be chuckling at anything out of Beirut.  A lot of comedy clubs in Lebanon.  Well, there's a picture in the paper today. 
[00:07:00]  There's this guy.  He's 101.  Wearing his Puma top.  Being pulled out of some rubble in Lebanon.  101.  Still surviving the bombings.  Can you imagine what this guy has seen in his lifetime over there?  Wow.  They love our clothing, though, over there, don't they?  They sure do.  He's wearing his Puma.  The guys, the women.  His Puma top.  They've got to, you know, buckle down.  But anyway.  Burkas.  Hey, really fast.  We've got a listener production piece here.  Weather report for all O&A markets.  This could be handy.  This is to keep everybody in the local feel, I guess. 
[00:07:30]  Opie and Anthony present your local forecast minute for Tuesday, August 15th.  I want to laugh, but I'd also like to know if I should wear a slicker.  Good morning, New York City.

Every day.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  I do traffic, too.  He says hi to Chi-Town.  He says it's going to be windy.  And then goes, just kidding.  Just kidding.  Of course, Windy City.  We all know.  RPI, you win something for that.  That's our new thing.  It's on our website, opianthony.com.  Give him something.  A place where listeners could help the program and win prizes for doing so. 
[00:09:30]  Just yelling at Iraq for no reason.  Very chintzy with the gifts, Eric.  All right.  Back to Phil Rosenthal.  Ah.  So then finally, he talks about local radio versus syndicator radio.  And then finally, we get a quote from Anthony.  Anthony, this is what we get after talking to the guy close to an hour.  People can be very much entertained by a syndicated radio show out of New York, said Anthony Cumia.  I don't think I said it like that.  The Anthony of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:10:00]  We really think our show is very universal and very relatable, no matter if you're in New York or in Chicago.  Thanks.  And I'm not busting on you.  We gave this guy some great stuff in the 45 minute to an hour interview.  And that's all he writes?  Brilliant stuff.  That's all he writes?  You phony?  That's so he can say, but like other syndicated stars, they're no more concerned with the second city than the fifth, sixth, or seventeenth. 
[00:10:30]  Well, you're right about that.  Who cares?  Our job is to be funny and entertaining.  Concerned about the show.  And, you know, we love picking up new markets everywhere so that other people can enjoy this program.  He's treating us like we're lobsters in Arnie Morton's.  Right.  Chicago reference.  Come on.  Good one.  Anyway, we decided to take a little peek at local radio in Chicago today. 
[00:11:00]  Just a little peek.  Let's pull the curtain back.  There's so many shows to choose from.  We've already made fun of Eric and Kathy.  We've got to get more Eric and Kathy audio.  Please get more Eric and Kathy.  Guys, I have a local joke.  Oh.  I saw this girl, and she said, is that the Sears Tower in your pantry?  Are you just happy to see me?  Oh, God.  Yeah, because it's so big. 
[00:11:30]  Ugh.  Phil is a douche.  He's a douche because he was hiding behind an agenda without telling us.  Why would he be?  Because he would assume.  We love controversy.  Yeah.  He assumes that we would go, oh, then we're not doing the interview.  Oh, my God.  We can't do this interview.  We would do it for you.  We would do the interview.  We wouldn't be all smiles and saying what we were saying with the questions that you were  asking that you had no intention of printing.  We'd give you the whole deal. 
[00:12:00]  You would have gotten better quotes probably because you would have smashed local radio  and hit it at that angle.  Yeah.  But no.  We pay attention to Chicago right now.  You're a little scared, Phil, were you?  You're a little scared that we might have been offended or hung up or not done the interview.  That isn't what we do.  Maybe if you were familiar with what we did coming into your market, you'd have known that.  We'd have still given you a good interview.  We have fun with Chicago radio.  Eric and Kathy, hours of fun.  That could be, could be the worst program I've ever heard. 
[00:12:30]  And I feel bad saying that because they don't seem like bad people.  Not a bad bone in their bodies, as a matter of fact, but just the dreck that spills out  of that show.  So it's the typical morning hackery with the guy and the whole, whole being any woman on  a radio show that has to be there to offset, to balance out the male point of view that 
[00:13:00]  the PDs always tell you is necessary in a radio show.  Shut up.  It isn't.  They're the ones that sit there when guys start getting a little too rambunctious, maybe  talking about sex, or maybe making a, cracking a little joke about domestic violence or any  of the taboo subjects, children, things like that.  They're the ones that chime in and go, now, fellas.  Oh, guys. 
[00:13:30]  Guys, guys.  That's not right.  Come on now.  I knew a friend of mine, Kathy, she had a problem with a boy, and it wasn't fun because  she got hurt.  Oh, we're supposed to sit there and go, yeah, boy, it's a good thing you're here to balance  it out.  Thank God.  Yo-ho.  Thank God.  They are worthless.  Go White Sox!  What?  Oh, nice.  What happened?  A little local reference popped out.  I liked it.  Phil Rosenthal, you ass. 
[00:14:00]  So today, because he kind of challenged us, we decided to pick just a random local show  in Chicago.  We've done the Eric and Kathy.  We've made fun of other shows in Chicago.  Today, we take a listen to Drex in the Morning.  Here it is.  Your local programming that is oh so precious to people like Phil Rosenthal, who believes  that unless you're local, you're screwed, and you stank, because there are local programs 
[00:14:30]  like this.  That's right.  What's the name there, Opie?  Drex in the Morning.  All right.  Let's pull the curtain back and take a listen.  Our own Sam helping us out with this bit.  Yay!  So why don't we play his theme song?  Sam's not black.  His ancestor's Thomas Jefferson. 
[00:15:00]  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thumb.  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure?  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  Let me know what that is.  Yeah, we're teasing, you know.  Cuz he's white with an afro. 
[00:15:30]  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  He ain't black.  Our own Sam has a theme song  Because he's got black man hair  Yeah  And he's related to Thomas Jefferson  So, you know, we know what happened with the slaves in Thomas Jefferson  I really think you're part black  You ought to look deeper into your genealogy  He just doesn't want to admit it  You don't want to face the truth?  I don't blame him  We would have hired you sooner if you were black, by the way 
[00:16:00]  Yeah  You gotta have a shwoogie on staff  Equal opportunity employers  Is what we are  Well, that's what they call it  That's what we gotta be  We call it no choice  Wish I had done that before  You had to wait a year  Because you didn't want to admit you were black  Damn, you admit you were black  You would have been hired right out of your internship  Yeah, my brother  Alright, Drex in the morning  What can you tell us about this fine radio show?  I can tell you that for some reason  It reminded me of when I was watching the Logo Channel 
[00:16:30]  Oh, really?  Yes  Logo Channel is on Cablevision at least  Is the gay channel  All gay programming  Which, by the way, we have a lot of logo audio that we've never gotten to  So maybe we could do that today  Where's it been hiding?  Or we could keep it very local for Chicago  And do another Karen Meyer segment  Oh, well  Those are terrific as well  Fantastic  Teaching Down Syndrome kids to read  Hey, that's good stuff  Latinos with mental illness 
[00:17:00]  I like that  And runners with disabilities  All reported by a deaf reporter  They have to get the deaf one to cover all the disabilities  That's interesting  Go ahead  That's so you can get all your big laughs out in one news segment  Right  You know, this whole hour  I know when it's coming  We should dedicate the first hour to Chicago  And we'll do a little Karen Meyer  Hey, why not  Alright, so  Drek in the morning  Or Drex in the morning  Drex  Oh, this is awful  This picture of them  You know who the one guy looks like? 
[00:17:30]  You remember in  Of this boy's life  The one who fights for the pink team?  Right  Who has the dog Pepper?  Right  That's exactly who this guy looks like  I'm gonna guess this is Drex  I don't know who it is  The blonde guy?  I can't  It's black and white  But the guy wearing the white t-shirt  Yeah, that's Drex  Who looks like he's never seen a penis that he's hated  That's Drex  Does this guy admit he's gay on his show?  I haven't heard him admit it  Or do they just make believe  They brush past it 
[00:18:00]  That that's not going on  And we have no idea, by the way  I haven't heard him admit it  Absolutely no idea  Who would, Opie?  But it sounds like this show would do real well in San Francisco  Yes  Well, no offense to San Francisco  They'll know in a minute  When we play it  They'll get a little taste of it  Alright, what's  This week has been a long one  What's that all about?  Oh, well I had to  There wasn't enough audio on the website for me to really grab  So I had to actually listen to the show  Streaming  Sorry  And just pull out  What my favorite clips were

Exactly  Okay, let's move along  Because then Joanne's getting nervous  It's time for her news  An awful box under the seat  And on top of it  Drex had a similar experience  Only the bone was on the seat  Oh, and his awful references  He yells out  Ah, Colonel  Colonel Sanders  Princess Sanders  Ah, drumstick  Yeah, because a colonel and a princess  He just panicked  It's really  Putting the two things together 
[00:24:30]  Uh, Bert and Philly  Oh, this is awful  Bert and Philly  In other local news  John Wayne Gacy's first victim  Would be turning 28 years old today  Exactly  Nice local reference  Yeah, we want local references  Thank you  For Chi-Town  Apparently everyone Gacy killed  Were potentially good radio hosts  All right  Uh, intro to what to do about gas prices bit 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, they just go for the, uh, total originality  They need some callers  So they're gonna talk about the gas  And how the prices are going up  Right  And then get some contribution from the listeners  Yeah  Gotcha  Because gas prices are only high in Chicago  So this is a great local thing to do  Local, right  It's local  Yeah  So then  Yeah  The whole gas thing  So I thought that we'd let you rant this morning  And, um, piss and moan and whine about the gas a little bit 
[00:25:30]  Yeah  So this is a mess  So let's call this Free Gas Tuesday  Except you're the one, uh, who gets to spew for free  About, uh, George Bush, uh, oil, gas  I don't care  Whomever, whatever  All right  I, I don't know what to say  This is not a real show  Yeah  Okay  Wait a minute, Sam  You went in the studio for three days  And made this stuff up  No, this is  You, who fan 
[00:26:00]  Travis played the girl  It's one of the top ten stations  That you had to put on a deeper voice  Yes  You put a tape recorder up to a buddy booth  And just listened through the hole  Wait, these guys are top ten in Chicago?  I don't know the show  The station, I think, is number eight  Ah  How many stations in Chicago?  Eleven?  Steve Dahl!  Oh, yeah  What?  Here you go  What?  I heard a local reference  You did?  Yes, I did  Oh  Well, now they go to the, uh, the phones 
[00:26:30]  And they talk to callers about the  All right, now we get some local flavor  Parking garage that Steve McQueen drove out of  And the bounty hunter  Ooh  Was it the bounty hunter, I think?  I didn't even know that  That's pretty deep  It's been Bullet  When he backs out and falls  I think Bullet was our friends in San Francisco, wasn't it?  Whatever it is  All right, here we go  You get it  Uh, Pete from Chicago  Good morning, you're on Kiss FM  Good morning, how you guys doing?  All right, man, go ahead  Um, I've actually been, uh, getting gas for about $20 a tank 
[00:27:00]  For the last, I'm gonna say, almost a year  Where? Where?  It's not bad  How are you, how are you doing that?  Um, well, I'm, I actually ran into a little financial problem  And I've been using one of those, um, prepaid credit cards  Oh, okay  Um, anytime that I pay at the pump, I'm only charged $20  Really?  Yes  I, I don't get that  It's a prepaid credit card, so you could put  You see what he's saying  He's getting the prepaid  You know what you're doing 
[00:27:30]  And it's, it's totally wrong  He's getting the cards  But the cards are, like, they're authorizing more than the minimum amount  Because sometimes they don't check the balance  They just want to check to see if the card's active  So he's using the $20 card and filling it up with $30  Hey, that's informative  Does that work?  Right  You got a little scam working  Right  Might you be expecting a bill someday, Pete?  Yeah  Yes  No  No?  I don't think so  That is clever  Hey, Pete, more power to you, man  Especially when it comes to gas 
[00:28:00]  No, I gotta go, I said too much  Right, exactly  Well, it's not like those companies aren't poking our eyes out  Oh, absolutely  Speaking of expecting a bill  I think the Grim Reaper is writing one for you  You're listening to the Art of the Homo  But we don't know  We have no idea  The crew discusses when you have to be mean  We're just about done  Oh, yeah  When you have to be mean?  Oh, no  Oh, all right  These guys, these guys bring it  They're edgy  Wow  Yeah, you know, sometimes you have to say mean things 
[00:28:30]  In order to straighten out the situation  And people don't like to hear things that are mean  Who does?  But  We do  That's the way it goes sometimes  That's the way mean goes  That's the way mean goes  That's the way  That's the way  That's the way mean goes  In some way, when you're close enough to someone  Then you have that comfortableness that you can be  Yeah, but  Painfully honest  That's not  You're talking about  This is like people who are not close  And they just say junk  Yeah  And they back it up like

[01:57:00]  Yeah, well, there you go.  Was that, you know, you're not going to hear the local weather.  Well, RPI gets a prize now.  Yes.  Go to opiananthony.com.  We give you little assignments, and if you help us out, we give you prizes.  That's what we do now.  That's what we do.  We try to reward you guys.  Yeah.  Which way?  Man stabbed.  Man stabbed.  Sounds tragic.  Well, let's listen in.  In Hoyoke tonight, where a man is recovering from a stab wound he suffered during a violent  domestic dispute early this morning. 
[01:57:30]  He is also the one under arrest.  Hoyoke police say Victor Cruz assaulted Ysenia Ortiz last night on their apartment on South  Stommer Street.  When officers arrived on scene, they saw that the woman had visible bruises and a bloody  lip.  Hoyoke police chief Anthony Scott described what happened when Ortiz,  defended herself.  She grabbed another knife and she stabbed him in the winky.  And at that time, he decided it was time to leave.  Hoyoke police arrested Cruz outside the apartment building and took him to Hoyoke Medical Center. 
[01:58:00]  They've charged Cruz with assault and battery.  They say he also had two outstanding warrants.  Cruz is still at the hospital recovering from his wounds.  Stabbed in the winky.  In the winky?  Is that the front?  Is that the eye?  I don't know what that means.  You wink your eye.  I know that.  Well.  I'm just trying to think because it couldn't be anything like that.  One eye trouser trout.  Couldn't be. 
[01:58:30]  Why?  Because they're adults talking on the news and you would think you could tell where someone  stabbed on the on the news.  It's a human body.  You can say penis.  It's OK.  And the guy has to say winky.  How is it that we have gotten to the point where a grown man describing a crime on the news  has to say winky?  The only time that's appropriate is if you're taking Jimmy fishing and you're showing him 
[01:59:00]  pornographic images right before the pat on the winky.  That's right.  I don't get it.  Oh, my God.  What what what are we becoming?  He was stabbed in the good old winky baby talk.  Yeah.  Well, it leads right into the next story that we should get before we get out of here.  A message to RPI.  If you do that again, the weather bit.  It's getting rave reviews, by the way.  But I think we should do it maybe from time to time.  Wouldn't be smart. 
[01:59:30]  Benny Hill music.  People are suggesting any hill music.  Benny Hill music.  People are suggesting this is the ghostwriting story.  Yeah.  Latest craze out there.  Houston.  Mary wanted lifestyle stuff.  Well, this is lifestyle stuff.  Here you go.  From Kansas, who records the show every day.  In the 50s, this was called a Chinese fire drill.  Right.  So they called it.  You stopped at a light.  Everybody got out, ran around the car, got back in and sped off.  Oh, what fun the 50s were.  Why a Chinese fire drill? 
[02:00:00]  Because that's what they called it.  I don't get it.  Because the 50s were racist.  Yeah.  That's what it was.  You'd get out of the car, and if you were a little dark, they would squirt you with a  fire hose and send German shepherds after you.  I stand corrected.  They loved their racism in the 50s.  Oh, the 50s, just full of it.  They would just cruise the same dumb block in their car, listening to Wolfman Jack, get  out, do the Chinese, my hair's all slicked back.  Doctail, Jimmy.  You know what I was saying? 
[02:00:30]  Listen, when you were saying that, I felt like I was watching American Graffiti.  All right.  You so accurately depicted the 50s in such few words, Jim.  Let's all climb into a phone booth, see how many we can fit in there.  How many can we fit in a phone booth?  I cuffed up my jeans.  Well, if I jam this in here, we can get one more in.  Well, it was either this or crystal meth.  You decide.  I'm going to roll my cigarettes up in the sleeve of my T-shirt.  Hey, you want to go steady?  Ready? 
[02:01:00]  Let's go watch the submarine races up at the point.  Yuck.  Should we?  Make it out in those dumb cars with awful radio reception?  Well, this is going to piss off Jimmy especially.  No satellite radio?  No.  This is the ghostwriting story.  We've got to squeeze this in from Good Morning America.  Listen, at the end of the story, they make sure they don't say Chinese fire drill.  Hence, yeah, parisathletal letters.  It involves leaving the wheel of a moving car and walking, running, or dancing beside said moving car. 
[02:01:30]  Now, young people have always been drawn to risky behavior.  This is just the latest flavor.  But it is seriously catching on.  Ghost ride the whip.  Ghost ride the whip.  Ghost ride the whip.  Ghost ride the whip.  Young people are making and posting hundreds, possibly thousands, of ghost riding videos on the Internet.  They're filmed on suburban roads, in parking lots, and on the freeway.  Some of them are highly choreographed, with kids jumping in and out of moving cars. 
[02:02:00]  In this one, the ghost rider wraps up his stunt just as a school bus approaches.  Here, a ghost rider loses control completely, crashing into a fire hydrant and a utility pole.  First thing a parent should say to their kid is, don't participate in that activity.  It's extremely dangerous.  Ghost riding is an updated version of car surfing, which has been going on for decades and has killed young people across the country.  These guys from Nashville made this ghost riding video. 
[02:02:30]  They acknowledge it probably wasn't too smart, but they say they would do it again.  Ghost riding was started not to see people succeed, but because so many people were going to fail.  They wanted to see people, you know, hit their car in the trees, run over their foot.  Ghost riding appears to have taken off as a result of popular rapper E-40,  who has a song where he repeatedly chants, ghost ride the whip.  Ghost ride the whip.  Ghost ride the whip.  Ghost ride the whip.  Ghost ride the whip.  E-40's song is the backup for many of the ghost riding videos on the internet. 
[02:03:00]  We would have never done this without the song that we were playing.  If you don't play that song, you're not ghost riding.  It's very likely that your kid could get hurt out there.  For proof of that, you need only take a quick glance at the internet.  That man gets run over by his own car.  When we were kids, at least the car would be stopping.  We'd run around at the stop sign.  The fire drill.  The fire drill.  Like that, that was bad enough.  But this, but the car still boots.  The fire drill.  On the next level.  Moms and dads might want to grab those keys and say, I know what ghost riding is.  Now, Dan.  Thanks, Dan.  Thanks very much. 
[02:03:30]  A fire drill.  It was a Chinese fire drill.  Yeah, it was called the Chinese fire drill.  I want to say for the record that I support ghost riding.  Yes.  The younger you are, the more I encourage you to do it.  Yes.  But make sure you have a few drinks first.  This way you're relaxed.  That's right.  You're loose and relaxed in a good dancing mood.  Right.  Don't forget, we're responsible broadcasters.  So, Jimmy, thank you for that.  You're absolutely right.  How about blindfolded, too?  That would be nice.  You blindfolded a couple of the kids.  And they got it wrong.  The rapper is obviously singing about something he's seen himself. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  He didn't invent ghost riding.  They're saying the kids wouldn't have done it if the song didn't come out.  No, I think they were doing it before the song came out.  Ghost ride the whip.  Ghost ride.  Should I?  Yeah, well, I mean, was he working on a book that somebody else is actually doing for him?  A ghost ride.  No, maybe that's what he was talking about.  By the way, a quick request to Steve.  A lot of people, I've noticed on the answer of feedback, they want Jim Norton's rant talking  to Lady Di yesterday over at XM.  Available on opandanthony.com.  And I think we should give the people that. 
[02:04:30]  That was an amazing 10, 15 minutes yesterday on the other show.  Yes.  Steve, thumbs up.  It'll be on opandanthony.com later today.  I listened to part of it.  It was vile.  Oh, it was great.  Vile.  How you just went from one thing to another.  You're completely giving a gentleman some of the best advice I've ever heard anyone give  anybody.  And in turn, at the same time, you are being horrid to this slob that is also on the line. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  You're like a schizo.  Yeah, it was great.  It was great.  It was really great.  It was so funny during the replay.  So we should make that available on opandanthony.com, okay?  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Douche.  Oh, there's our music.  No?  I got a crush today?  I wasn't listening.  I wasn't listening.  I'm sorry.  Because they want us to talk about Bud Light really fast before we get out of here.  The Opian Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006, coming soon to a venue near  you.  Press release on opiananthony.com.  We sold more tickets than Jay Leno or something like that. 
[02:05:30]  Record breaking.  We set a record.  For the PNC or something like that?  For the venue.  And it's 39-year history.  Never sold so many tickets for a comedy event.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Jay Leno is one guy.  And we have, I think, 80 comedians on ours.  We have 400 comedians on ours.  It's May on the Omidy Cave.  Yeah, but let's keep it in perspective here.  Jay Leno is, uh...  Break a record.  We broke a record.  All right.  But he's a monster in comedy.  Right.  We're bigger than Jay.  Tickets available for the August 26th show at the PNC.  Ticketmaster.com.  All the infos on opiananthony.com. 
[02:06:00]  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  We're out of here.  Thanks, guys.  You got a war face?  What the F?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  Oh!  The F you didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No!  You don't scare me.  Work on it.  Jackass.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah!  Here we go.  How do we do it?  I don't know.  How do we do it?  I really don't know anymore.  You people don't understand how we toil and work for you.  For you!  For you, man!  We did it for you, okay?  Gog.  Now we're XM.  No more than local horse shit.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Enough of those motherfuckers.  I forgot to mention that Phil Rosenthal from the Chicago Sun-Times. 
[02:07:00]  Yes.  His articles appear in the Seattle newspaper, so that makes him a syndicated writer.  A syndicated columnist?  But that's okay for him.  Do you think the people in Seattle like the fact that some Chicago guy is coming in there and writing?  Yeah.  Doesn't that go against what he was writing about local radio?  How does he know what the weather is when his article is posted?  Shut up.  Phil's a cunt.  Jackass.  Well, let's take our little walk. 
[02:07:30]  We got new faces on the walk today.  Who are these guys?  Yeah, they came from Kentucky.  Kentucky.  Nice.  Came up from Kentucky.  Hey, guys.  Get to the Louisville market, man.  We're starving for some great talent like y'all.  Nothing but hacks down there.  Well, you got the XM, though, so you're set, right?  At least you're only starving for talent.  You're a big fellow.  Oh, forget it.  And cover that very good.  It was a little rainy earlier.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  And I think it stopped because we do our walk, and the weather knows.  Where's the old man and the dog today?  I don't know.  Oh, he did.  He left.  Yeah, the guy's changed his schedule.  Here's Andrew.  Right?  That's his name?  Yeah.  Is it?  Andrew.  How you doing, bud?  How are you guys?  You okay today?  I'm all right.  How are you keeping dry in the weather?  Underneath the awning there?  Yeah, if it rains, I go there.  Yeah, you move over there?  And if it doesn't rain, I come out. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Wow, that's a big decision every day you got to make.  You know, it's such.  By some money, I would be selling umbrellas.  Selling umbrellas, right.  Yeah, you got to have a little capital for an investment to start doing that.  You must get pretty lonely, though, because no one talks to you except us all day, right?  Well, you know, you cannot talk the same thing over and over again, right?  Yeah, so you must get a little lonely, though, during the day.  Well, you know, I'm not lonely.  I enjoy myself to be alone.  You just sit and think of your thoughts? 
[02:09:00]  No, I know.  I mean, I have my regulars.  I have, you know.  Yeah, a couple of regular customers.  You got to establish yourself.  Yeah.  Do you find that you talk to homeless people more?  You have to be respectful of people.  His voice is awful.  Respectful of people.  I know.  I can't really tell like this, but when you listen back to the replay.  The other guy was there.  You sound really funny on the radio.  I got to tell you.  Your voice, it sounds like this a little bit.  Like, it's really funny on the radio.  Well, you know, the other guy was like a little bit, you know, out of touch, you know? 
[02:09:30]  Do you get like very, very cold when you're out here?  Of course I get cold.  I'm a human, you know.  No, but I mean like in the summer and stuff, do you like, how do you stay very, very dry?  I'd say a third.  Well, there are places you could go, you know.  There are places where you got like Sony building.  Right.  You could go down there.  And then there are places, you know.  So, there's one on 53rd Street by the Hilton Hotel.  Boring!  What's your sweatshirt say? 
[02:10:00]  That's very colorful and very nice.  Nice.  Clearwater Beach.  Where is that?  Looks like a tattoo Steve is getting on his back.  I don't know.  It looks somewhere warm and nice.  Oh, you mean you weren't there?  If it has to be beach, it has to be warm.  Yeah.  Oh.  Somebody bought that for somebody on vacation, right?  And then they sucked so bad it went into one of those bins.  Ended up in the homeless shelter.  So, you guys would do things.  And you got it.  Right.  Which is cool.  Do you have any WAF radio wear?  Yeah, I know.  Because I know my ex-wife gave all mine to the fucking homeless. 
[02:10:30]  It's a St. Patrick's thing, right?  Two years ago and they were fired from there.  I don't know what he said.  I like how he's got the Nike Swish hat on, though.  It's like, just do...  Eh, forget it.  Just do nothing.  Just do...  Eh, fuck it.  Tamara.  He knows us from the St. Pat's thing.  Four years ago.  Oh, you do?  How do you know that?  Did he tell you?  Well, he's very big in the church.  Yeah, I was reading the...  I always read the papers, you know.  Yeah.  The papers read the papers.  Yeah.  What's in your satchel there?  Your bag? 
[02:11:00]  What do you carry with you on a daily basis?  What's in your bag today?  Open up your bag.  What do you need?  All I need today is a bag.  Let's play.  Let's make a deal.  What's in Andrew's bag?  What's in your bag today, sir?  My clothes.  Just clothes?  My toiletries.  My soap.  My razors.  Toiletry.  My underwear.  Yeah.  Nice.  What kind of underwear do you wear?  Toothpaste, toothbrush.  Toothpaste, toothbrush.  All right, let's see some of this stuff.  Come on.  Can we look at it?  You want to look at it?  Yeah, let's go.  Let's see what you have. 
[02:11:30]  It might be worth a few bucks today.  Let's go.  We're nice guys.  We won't screw with you.  What kind of underwear?  Do you wear bikini briefs?  No, sir.  I wear briefs.  I don't wear boxes like Clinton.  Okay.  Cool, Anthony.  Shut up.  Just because I wear briefs also doesn't mean...  I pay for...  All right.  You got a little Hezbollah...  My underwear.  Hezbozos are losers.  Well, you keep your underwear.  They look clean.  Oh, they keep them in plastic bags.  Where do you get them laundered?  Huh?  Where do you get those clean? 
[02:12:00]  I go to the laundry.  You go to the laundry?  No.  They're dirty.  I throw them away.  I wear a new one.  And then you buy new ones?  Yeah, but the midnight one, they come, they give us, you know.  Oh, they give you new ones.  I don't have a ton of money to go to the laundry and all this, you know, and put my  clean clothes in the dirty clothes.  Sweetie, how long did it take a pair to get dirty?  How long until you consider it unwearable?  No, every one day I change.  Wow, this guy is a germaphobe, too.  I keep myself clean.  That's why I got so many.  You go through a pair of underwear a day? 
[02:12:30]  No, I only go one underwear a day, so like everybody else.  You know, I'm generous, but I want to make sure I didn't slip a 20 in there.  I had a 40.  There you go.  Never give them more than they can handle.  There you go, sir.  What else is in the bag, though?  We're just getting into it.  Yeah, never give them more than they can handle, Jimmy.  That's a good advice.  Never give them more than they can handle.  Sir, I only have a 20 today, so I can't help you out.  I'm sorry.  You can make change now.  If I have enough money to sell it, I'm happy.  Oh, there you go.  Look at that.  Kentucky's helping out. 
[02:13:00]  The Kentucky fella.  That was for his Happy Meal.  What else is in the bag?  He's sacrificing a burger.  Yeah, what else you got in there?  Zipper's this way.  Over here, Andrew.  Yeah.  There it is.  There's a problem that we just have with him.  All right.  He's got his underwear there.  Another plastic bag.  Sandwich for the...  Sandwich?  Oh, sandwich.  Very nice.  Where'd you get that?  The church?  Yeah, in the morning.  In the morning.  Yeah.  Awesome.  I don't know what my dad's going to bring it to me, so I've got to be prepared.  Yeah, yeah.  So you get the extra sandwich.  My shaving cream.  There's his shaving cream and stuff, so he can shave. 
[02:13:30]  My sandbag.  You know, you're a pretty organized, well-adjusted homeless guy.  Look, he's a responsible homeless guy.  You shouldn't be homeless.  He even has a dress shirt in there in case...  A job interview.  ...somewhere nice or a job interview.  I go to Microsoft and...  True.  Very nice.  Napkins.  Napkins.  Delo's hiring for customer service.  Pablo.  What about personal items?  Something that reminds you of home or family or something?  Do you have anything like a crucifix or a picture or something personal? 
[02:14:00]  No, if you want, I'll bring it over.  Why?  Where do you keep that?  I'll keep it with a friend of mine in Queens.  Oh, friend of yours.  So you got some personal property that you just...  Can he let you stay with him?  Nice watch, too.  You don't want anyone seeing that or your money's going to go way down.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, the watch is broken.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, the watch is broke.  I think I can take care of that.  When I get my time, you know...  Yeah, it's still the time, you know.  You want me to take care of that for you?  It doesn't have the side pin to put it in there. 
[02:14:30]  You want me to take care of it for you?  No, Opie, don't take care of it.  Don't give that to him, by the way, Andrew.  Okay, I get it.  It's nothing.  It's a whole lot.  Yeah, but don't...  You won't know what time it is.  Like he needs to know what time it is.  Yeah, right?  Where do you got to go?  No, don't do that.  I need my time.  He needs his watch.  Oh, you need your time on.  You can't be.  I need the time.  One time I have to wake up.  I have to go.  No, don't.  I can't watch that.  What time is it?  It's time to run into the street and get your watch.  I've already been a douche to you today, so there's your watch. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  Well, you're...  Bye, Andrew.  You're doing all right, Andrew.  Thank you.  God bless you all.  He's getting a lot of money today.  That's a nice take.  It's true.  I hope the IRS comes after him.  Early in the day.  And then when we leave, you got to take that out of the cup and put it in your pocket.  Yeah, that's what I do.  So people know that, you know, they think you only have a few pennies.  That's true.  And so nobody else comes by and takes your cup.  That's true.  Yeah.  I know the deal.  I know the score.  I know the word on the street.  But, you know, I try to be as honest as possible.  I hear you.  Yeah, that's good. 
[02:15:30]  But you don't want to flash around the cash.  Yeah, you can't do that.  Get yourself something good.  I'm sitting here for nothing.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, you know.  All right.  You have a good time.  Okay, God bless you.  There he goes.  Well, there we go.  Okay, I got a Jew's harp here.  A Jew's harp.  I just jammed up here in the city a long time ago.  Oh.  Now, you're from Kentucky?  No, that's my nephew.  Oh, he's from Kentucky.  I live up there in Middletown.  Oh, Middletown.  And you learn how to play that win. 
[02:16:00]  I played this here in New York City in 1963.  63?  What is it called?  It's called a Jew's harp.  A Jew's harp.  Nothing to do with people of nationality.  It's just spelled J-E-W-S.  All right, play something cool.  Mel Gibson hates that harp.  Ready?  Jew's harp.  That's actually a statement.  It's the harp that starts all the wars.  That's like what the hillbillies use.  Yeah.  You know, I tried using those once as a kid, and it smacks into your lip and tooth and 
[02:16:30]  could really hurt.  That's going bad.  My first time, our first time, everybody's got their head back down.  The sun shined above the ground.  Everybody run for my first time.  Black people are running away, scared.  They think the South is rising again.  Chicken train.  Yeah.  Look out, revenues, boys.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:17:00]  Do you know the Yellow Rose of Alabama?  No, sorry.  The closest I ever got to rock and roll was Led Zeppelin Hot Dog.  That ain't quite rock and roll.  Could you play that while I remove a Jigaboo from a speakeasy?  Thank you.  I really appreciate it.  You guys are great.  You like that.  You're pretty good at that.  I got to tell you.  Louisville.  He's pretty good at that. 
[02:17:30]  Very good.  I wonder if he plays the harmonica.  Oh, look at this miserable.  Oh, look at this fucking picture of Joy.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I think she runs away from us every time we try to talk to her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hello, miss.  Now she's going to yell.  We're doing just on-the-street stuff.  How are you today?  What's your name?  You don't know your name?  Don't be shy.  Are you homeless?  Where's she going?  I don't know.  You're walking away from your possessions. 
[02:18:00]  Wait, you can't leave your stuff, ma'am.  Ma'am?  You can't leave your stuff.  Crazy.  All right.  She's some kind of crazy person.  She's beyond nuts.  Yeah.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  She does that every time we-  She's a great body.  She's a, yeah.  I wouldn't mind fucking her.  Oh.  Wow.  She looks like Ruth Gordon if she was alive and crazy.  You're among friends' possessions.  That's good.  Hi.  How you doing, sir?  What happened?  Want to hear a song? 
[02:18:30]  Sure, Vic.  Yeah, let's hear a song.  Oh.  Hey, this guy's got a harmonica.  I wasn't too scared.  What are you playing?  A song called I'm a Douche.  Ah, that was a little, uh...  Hey, Mel Carmeson, what song is that?  What?  What happened to the, uh, paw? 
[02:19:00]  What happened to your mitt?  Exploding peanut butter sandwich.  That's a good one.  All right.  I was jerking off and my dick exploded.  All right, that could happen, too.  Two for two.  Well, that's very good on a harmonica, sir.  Thank you very much.  Godspeed.  Take care.  Take care.  All right.  Something happens when the weather changes in this city.  It has a direct impact on the people. 
[02:19:30]  Anyone else-  The crazies come out.  Anyone else get scared when he was reaching into his pocket?  I know Kenny and-  No, I didn't at all, because I saw Kenny's eyes.  Kenny's eyes were glued on his hand.  If, Kenny, what if-  Were you looking right at his hand?  Oh, yeah.  You always watch the hands.  And what if you saw some threat?  What would you have done if that was maybe a little, uh, 32, like a Saturday night special?  His wrist would have been broken the second it came out of the pocket.  I would love to see that.  Love to see that.  Yeah, me too.  Damn it.  Even if it was a pen for an autograph. 
[02:20:00]  Stupid harmonica.  Next time it's a harmonica, it might be a gun, so break his wrist anyway.  You know how bad I wanted to throw his harmonica on the street?  Oh.  Watch him chase it.  Yeah, to the garbage juice that fucking collects by the curb.  Oof.  He did-  That guy looked like an extra from Mannix.  Like the Italian, like, gangster guy.  Awful people are out today.  Yeah, it's awful.  Just waiting at our, uh, don't walk sign that we usually have to wait at. 
[02:20:30]  What's the cigar for, Kenny?  The guy from Kentucky gave me the cigar.  It's got booze in it.  It's Maker's Mark.  You know who'd like that?  Ronnie?  Ronnie Fez?  I'll, I'll, I'll, maybe I'll present it to you.  Ronnie would like it.  Fez would like it too if you leave it in the hard case.  Right.  Just turn it upside down and leave it on his seat.  All right.  Hey there, pal.  You watch it.  All right.  How you doing?  Morning.  Howdy.  Morning.  Morning. 
[02:21:00]  Morning.  Good morning.  Pleasure.  Pleasure.  All right.  Other side of the street.  Almost there.  That was nice.  I think the early portion of the walk is a lot more action-packed.  Yeah.  Than the later portion, where on this sidewalk,  the personality kind of changes.  Wow.  More people just going to work,  minding their own business.  Yes.  Morning.  What are you thinking, though?  You think our other homeless guy is dead? 
[02:21:30]  No, he's probably just relocated.  On vacation.  Why would he, why would you relocate  when you were, like, getting money from us?  I think Bill Burr said he relocated.  Yeah, he's seen him?  I think so.  I think he was saying that on Friday.  All the same posters.  So we're just about done today.  Why would you relocate?  Yeah, people are giving you cash.  The illusionist, Edward Norton.  Is he supposed to come in?  Yes.  No, he said he might take my shooting.  So he might reschedule for tomorrow or Friday.  Yeah, so we'll, we'll restrain ourselves. 
[02:22:00]  No, no, no.  He wants to come in.  It's a travel day issue  because they need an extra travel day  because all these fucking restrictions now.  Is that it?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  What happened?  A guy from Louisville.  What?  A guy drove all the way up from Louisville, Kentucky  to see you guys.  He wants to know if he can get a picture with you.  No.  Of course.  Come on in, sleep.  Step right up.  Gentlemen, the first time I've heard you all  was on the Sean Hannity show  before y'all started XM.  That's where I heard about y'all.  Really?  That's pretty cool.  And then I picked it up.  I like Sean.  Been sick ever since. 
[02:22:30]  Thank you, sir.  Well, sir, thank you.  What are you doing now with the rest of your day?  Since you're from Kentucky,  you've got a whole day in New York City.  What are you doing?  7.05.  I got Yankee tickets to watch them  whoop up on the Orioles.  And from here,  probably just walk around a little bit,  go catch some at the Brooklyn Diner  and chill around New York City.  Brooklyn Diner.  A guy like you,  you better get a second mortgage on your house.  Place is a little expensive  if you didn't get the joke.  Come see me at the strip club tomorrow night.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, 38th and 11th headquarters.  Sounds good, man.  There's girls with good anatomy there. 
[02:23:00]  Teddy's doing an appearance tomorrow night.  Yeah.  That means plug it.  Yeah.  What time?  Nice plug.  7 o'clock.  Pre-admission.  I'm giving away traveling virus tickets.  Where?  At headquarters, 38th and 11th.  I'm going to the traveling virus show in Cleveland, actually.  Ah.  Looking forward to that.  And by the way,  we have a big contest going here on XM.  The 39th caller gets two tickets to my Houston show.  That's right.  39th caller. 
[02:23:30]  Houston.  Oh, leg out.  Let's not block the door.  Enjoy New York, sir.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  We appreciate that.  All right.  We'll continue upstairs in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Mexican.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that.  And a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags. 
[02:24:00]  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  Pedophile humor.  Woo.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for pop.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us. 
[02:24:30]  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that bath.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:25:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:25:30]  Let's get that music off a little sooner.  How long is it going?  Eight, ten minutes?  Yeah, one minute.  I was so scared in the elevator today. 
[02:26:00]  Some guy with no arms.  He's in the elevator.  Yeah, well, he had one that was no arm, and then the other one was a little, like, arm.  I saw you guys heading into that elevator.  I'm like, there's no way I can do it today.  And Jimmy was there, and we stopped at the third and fourth floor.  And the third floor, some girls got off, and Jimmy just goes, all right.  Like, when the doors opened, like, he was all mad that it didn't go directly to his floor.  He was angry.  I want to get right to my floor, guy. 
[02:26:30]  And then I thought maybe a joke would come out, but thank God it didn't.  At one point, Sam looked at the guy with the one arm and the one baby arm, and then looked at me, and I had to bite my tongue almost until it bled to stop from any kind of reaction.  I did not want to be embarrassed.  No, that was a little rough.  Yeah, I saw you just go, nope, not part of this ride.  No, no.  Nope.  In situations where you think I would be brave, I actually go the other way. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  No way.  Just got to walk away.  Bail.  Got to walk away.  Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.  Sorry.  John from Connecticut.  Hey, guys, I thought you were on vacation next week.  Is that a...  Is he trying to say we're having a bad show?  Is that a joke?  I get it, because if we were on vacation, we'd be what?  How bored are you guys today?  This is the same guy.  That was the most nothing walkover. 
[02:27:30]  I love how you guys waste time.  Wow.  Hmm.  What do you expect us to do?  Oh, hold on to me.  How about...  You just don't listen.  Yeah.  How about you don't listen?  What do you want us to do on the walkover?  Shithead, we just report what's going on.  If it's quiet, we act...  It's quiet.  We're not going to make stuff up.  Some days it's really good, and other days it sucks.  Exactly.  I really thought it was going to be a short walk today, but then we got some things done.  And I kind of like that.  A couple of weird people on the street. 
[02:28:00]  Got to talk to them.  Give a little feel of the streets.  Screw him.  Who cares?  You know, I really don't care anymore with these idiots.  I've even stopped banning them.  Like, I just...  I so don't even...  I don't care.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Remember yesterday we were talking about those two morons on the radio station, WNEW?  Mm-hmm.  They had this contest where they encouraged people to have sex in public places. 
[02:28:30]  Well, they're toast.  It's over.  They apparently went way over the line when they encouraged a couple to have sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral  and then broadcast these activities on their program.  Opie and Anthony, out of here.  The couple has been charged with obscenity and public lewdness.  They're due back in court in October, accused of having sex in the church while worshipers observed the Feast of the Assumption.  And what a tasteful experience this whole thing was.  The radio show offered a prize for listeners to have sex in public places. 
[02:29:00]  When public outrage reached the boss's desk, the head of Viacom dropped the axe on the show.  And the postscript is,  The Catholic League says the punishment fits the crime and it will now drop its complaint with the Federal Communications Commission.  Much, I'm sure, to the relief of the people who own WNEW Radio.  Four years ago today, they didn't want us playing these clips on commercial radio, by the way.  At first, I thought you were just playing, like, a show that was ripping us off and had the same ill fortune.  Let's say hi to Bill in Vegas. 
[02:29:30]  Bill, what's up?  Oh, Bill.  Hey, I miss the old Opie.  Why?  You know, the one that would have smashed the homeless guy's watch.  I'm trying not to be so predictable.  He held that watch in his ass.  I wanted to throw the watch.  And then I'm like, no, that's what they're expecting from me.  I did feel you resist the temptation.  He really did have to.  It was like watching an alcoholic look at a bottle of whiskey.  He was shaking.  He really was, like, on the verge of just heaving it. 
[02:30:00]  I wish I could have been there.  To be honest with you, I was going for the dramatic moment.  I was waiting for traffic and maybe, like, a city bus, and nothing was driving by at that moment.  No.  I was like, this is going to be it.  It was there.  The pregnant pause.  It was a real pregnant pause.  I was thinking too much.  I should have just reacted.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  How many of you are here for the open tennis in Queens?  How many of you are here for...  Okay. 
[02:30:30]  How many of you are here for the open sex at St. Patrick's Cathedral?  How many of you are here?  All right.  That's fine.  Uh-uh.  What?  Hey.  Don't ask if you don't want to hear the tough answers.  You had a lot of fun with that, huh?  He certainly did.  Letterman had a ball with that.  What?  Banana, strawberries, flavored seltzer, orange, anything.  What is that? 
[02:31:00]  That's what I'm getting.  Oh.  Look at Kenny's block child letters.  I know.  Anything.  It's like being assaulted.  It sort of sounds good, but I'm trying to figure out what it is.  That's all.  This is Jim's order, and this is my question.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll do my thing.  Kenny writes the way stalkers send things when they cut them out of magazines.  That's what his handwriting looks like.  A bunch of pasted-together letters with a death threat to the president.  What would you like?  Nothing on that.  Jesus.  That was a long way to go for a zero. 
[02:31:30]  Huh?  I'm not saying they should have got a standing ovation, but complete indifference.  Smoothie.  Okay.  Sorry.  I was reading and typing.  Granted, I didn't need high fives.  What happened?  I didn't need fucking ooh-oohs.  I can't wait to hear the replay.  What happened?  I said something.  It was intended to be a joke, but it came disguised as a boring statement.  That was great for us.  Listening to the replay is like listening to a brand new show for us.  Yeah.  I don't know what I was doing when he said that. 
[02:32:00]  That's right.  I don't even remember.  I pick up on so many things I should have.  David and Houston.  Houston.  Hey.  Yes.  Yeah.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  All right.  Good.  We got that out of the way.  Yes.  I think I'm the 39th caller.  Woo-hoo.  Well, matter of fact, you are the 39th.  Ah.  That's what they put you through.  So give Derek your information off, and you have a couple of tickets to one of the shows  in Houston. 
[02:32:30]  I just don't know which one.  At the Improv, right?  Yeah.  Houston Improv.  This weekend.  Huh?  I'll be thrilled to go to any of them.  Thank you.  It's this weekend, sir.  Hold on a line.  You really do have a pair of tickets.  Hold on.  There goes David from Houston.  H-O-U-S.  Wes in Atlanta.  Wes.  Hey, dude.  What's up?  What's up, Wes?  Hey, man.  Man, I got this story straight out of a page of little Jimmy's book.  Sunday, I was going down the road, and this chick had a flat tire sitting out in the middle  of the highway. 
[02:33:00]  Dude, I pulled over, changed the tire for her.  She said she wanted to give me some money.  She didn't have any.  I didn't want it anyway.  She said, pull over in this parking lot.  So we were talking for a minute.  We were in my truck.  She kept rubbing my leg, saying, I wish there was something I could do for you.  And I was like, you don't have to do anything for me.  My dick got hard.  Next thing I know, dude, she was sucking my fucking dick in the truck.  It was un-fucking-believable.  Nothing ever happens to me like that.  Just the way she was rubbing your leg, though, I wish there was something I could do for you.  Who is she? 
[02:33:30]  Fucking Mae West?  Hi, Daddy.  Yeah.  I wish there was something I could do for you.  She was a beautiful black girl with a blonde wig and arms like Kobe Bryant.  No, dude, I'm telling you, it was a trip.  I never expected that to happen, but...  There's a big surprise.  Why else would you change a girl's tire if you don't want your dick sucked?  Penthouse Forum.  There's no other reason for it.  Dense version.  Yeah, I hear you, but I had to call you guys and tell you, man.  Thank you.  What'd she look like? 
[02:34:00]  Thanks for sharing.  She's about 5'5".  Probably brunette.  Probably brunette.  Big fucking tits.  Nice big ass.  Was she a little chubby?  Yeah, she had to be.  Nope.  Not at all.  All right.  All right, Wes.  Well, good luck, buddy.  She was just in distress, dude.  All right, boys, I'm punching out.  That was an unbelievable story.  The excitement in the room is just...  In his voice.  How do you make a blowjob story boring?  Yeah.  Right?  A spontaneous blowjob story just turns into nothing. 
[02:34:30]  You guys should be insane to yourself!  Most people come to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray.  But last week, one couple allegedly came to the New York City landmark to have sex.  Brian Florence and Loretta Harper were arrested for public lewdness after their carnal communion,  a few feet from worshippers, was described live on the radio.  Well, shock jock's opium, Anthony, had encouraged the couple to have sex at locations where a producer was waiting to call in the play-by-play.  The radio team, part of Infinity Broadcasting, is off the air, and their managers have been suspended. 
[02:35:00]  But religious organizations are demanding the station's license be revoked.  This is outrageous.  Not only does it involve obscenity in the most extreme form,  people having sex at 4 o'clock in the afternoon at St. Patrick's Cathedral on a holy day,  but the nerve of these people to actually have it as a set-up.  For its part, the station says,  WNEW regrets the unfortunate incident that took place.  We apologize to anyone who has been offended,  and have taken measures to ensure that it does not happen again.  Worst statement ever. 
[02:35:30]  The worst fucking corporate statement ever.  I didn't believe that.  That was a bad one.  And that guy, who's that reporter?  Do we know?  That fucking voice.  I want to ask one of these guys,  why do you fucking do that?  Hey, why do you talk like that?  Why do you put on a voice that is not yours?  Can we hear the sex line again?  For sex.  Well, to pray.  Most people come to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray. 
[02:36:00]  But last week, one couple allegedly came to the New York City landmark to have sex.  To have sex.  To have sex.  They allegedly came to the New York City landmark to have sex.  What is he saying?  Why do you talk like that?  That's a good broadcaster.  To have sex.  That's a good broadcasting voice.  Oof.  Ah, see.  Sex.  The radio station that fired shock jocks Opie and Anthony is still under investigation.  The Federal Communications Commission says it's being flooded with complaints regarding WNEW-FM. 
[02:36:30]  The station broadcast a couple allegedly having sex inside St. Patrick's Cathedral.  And now the FCC is looking into whether to strip the station of its broadcast license.  But experts say never before has the station lost its license based on an indecency complaint.  Right now, WNEW is filling the slot once filled by Opie and Anthony seen here with a nationally syndicated talk show. 
[02:37:00]  Meanwhile, the couple involved in the alleged sex stunt is facing charges of public lewdness and obscenity.  Was it Lick-Ass?  Who took our spot?  It was Lick-Ass for like a week.  I'm Lick-Ass.  Yeah.  We handed it to him.  Gave it to him.  And he did nothing with it.  A snuffer platter.  Now there's a time and place for everything.  And a couple found out today that St. Patrick's Cathedral ain't the place for sex.  Cops say the couple from Virginia were in the vestibule of the cathedral and were observed performing a sex act. 
[02:37:30]  37-year-old Brian Florence and 35-year-old Loretta Lynn Harper were charged with public lewdness.  42-year-old Paul Mercurio was allegedly recording the act and was on the phone with the Opie and Anthony radio show.  He was charged with acting in concert.  The stunt didn't fit well with people outside of St. Patrick's Cathedral.  That's crazy.  Not in the church.  In the church, that's kind of bad.  Other public places, whatever you want to do.  But in the church, that's a little off.  I don't know.  Archdiocese spokesman Joseph Zwilling agreed. 
[02:38:00]  His only comment was that it was, quote, disgusting.  Terry Sheridan, 10-10 wins at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Not as disgusting as some of the other things that happened.  This was really, this is really depressing to listen to, man.  I think people are interested.  No, I mean, for me.  I've never heard that one before.  It's enraging, though, that the company fucking pushed it out like that.  Stupid Mel.  And I also want to talk about how far is too far.  On radio, you have the situation in New York with two guys, Opie and Anthony.  We share the same agent. 
[02:38:30]  Now, I study to be a minister.  Oh, Christ on a pony.  This guy is the biggest douchebag.  This is man cunt.  Right.  Oh.  I study to be a minister, and that's where I learned to use this fake radio voice.  Let me tell you something.  You just don't go into a church and do these kind of things.  Oh, listen to this phony asshole.  He could do the footprint poem in that voice.  Yeah, it would be the same thing.  All right.  I study to be a minister. 
[02:39:00]  Did you?  We share the same agent.  Now, I study to be a minister.  You know this.  I study to be a minister.  I do.  And I couldn't believe the company.  Look, it's had a devastating effect on radio.  The fact is it's had a devastating effect on adult male radio.  It's affected everybody.  It's kind of true.  We, like, wrecked it for everybody, and now we're back to save the day.  Look how it affected us.  You fuck.  We wrecked it.  We literally wrecked it for everyone.  We ruined it for everybody so we could tiptoe in later on and save it. 
[02:39:30]  We are assholes.  I mean, radio hates us.  Oh.  Because they were getting away with murder before we did the Sex for Sam thing.  Yeah, fuck the Janet Jackson thing.  This is what, like, stopped.  And I don't want to start sounding like hoo-hoo, but I would even say that we made satellite radio popular.  Because these guys couldn't do anything.  Couldn't go anywhere.  Anywhere else.  And after we got the boot, everyone else was being threatened with the boot. 
[02:40:00]  It didn't matter what your ratings were.  It used to be.  Holy crap.  Shock jocks were getting fired every week for something that was just dumb and who cares.  It used to be if you had ratings, they would not fire you.  Wouldn't happen.  You'd get suspended.  You'd get bitched at.  Whatever.  Or even they might pull a week's pay and suspend you.  You'd have to do some kind of charity event.  Whatever it was, you didn't get fired.  We got fired.  And we had great ratings.  And they fired us.  And when that happened, the floodgates opened. 
[02:40:30]  And no matter what these jocks did, they were being thrown out the door.  After us, left and right, boom.  They were all just being thrown out the door.  So it made radio.  We really did change radio.  All milk coasty.  To the point it sucked so bad that they had to bring us back to save it.  I want to say that ten more times today.  Oh, it really is funny when you think about it.  It's like the rape victim calling the rapist saying, look, I'm having trouble coming.  Yeah.  Would you stop over?  Could you come over and help me out? 
[02:41:00]  Maybe we can figure something out here.  Oof.  Oh, my God.  So he's right.  There is a piece of blueberry on your tooth that makes it look like you should be playing the harmonica or the juice harp.  Oh, you saw that guy?  When he was talking about the peanut butter sandwich, I'm like, it looks like you just ate the peanut butter sandwich.  And I was going to say that, too.  I had a wimpy walkover.  I've got to be honest.  Devastating effect on adult male radio.  It's affected everybody.  But on a personal level, what monsters?  Sex in a church.  My God.  Shock radio. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  Now, they were very talented.  They did very well in the artwork.  I like Sean Hannity because it was a tough subject.  And he handled it.  Sean's at least being factual.  He's honest.  He handled it very well.  He obviously knew we were successful.  And in order to do that in radio, you have to have some talent.  So he's just laying it out.  And Mancow is just trying to...  The holier-than-thou attitude Mancow has in this whole thing is ridiculous. 
[02:42:00]  I mean, my God.  Oh, your God.  My God.  Where's your God now, unemployed ass fuck?  Let's list all the things you did.  Hannity is great, man.  I love Hannity.  Opie and Anthony.  Now, they were very talented.  They did very well in New York.  And there's no...  You can't dispute their success.  Yeah, I really can.  They weren't talented.  No, no.  I was up against them.  Sorry.  I'm telling you, they had good ratings.  Look, we have the same agent, a guy named Bob Eatman out of L.A. 
[02:42:30]  Not anymore.  I don't think so.  I really don't think so.  I read their ratings.  I don't think so.  What an asshole.  How is he denying numbers?  Sean Hannity is giving cold, hard facts.  Syndicated success.  We didn't get thrown off of stations because of low ratings.  Like you.  We got thrown off of all our stations at once because we were fucking idiots.  That's why we got fired.  We didn't lose our flagship station because we sucked.  And the GM would rather go with a fucking iPod format than man queer, man cunt, man dick. 
[02:43:00]  This guy is delusional.  I'm so glad he got fired.  And after going through what we went through, I don't like to say that lightly.  I really don't.  I don't like seeing anybody, especially in radio, losing their jobs over certain things.  But this motherfucker, go fuck yourself.  I don't think so.  I really don't think so.  But I read their ratings.  I'm telling you, they did well. 
[02:43:30]  Well, okay, great.  You know what?  Hey, the Christians and the Lions sold out every night.  That's easy.  What they did was easy.  Sex in a church is easy and it's evil.  Easy and evil.  He is such a douchebag.  He thinks this is all we did.  Does every time you hear him piss you off?  Oh, I can't even tell you.  There really isn't anyone else that whenever I hear their voice, I get fucking annoyed.  Than this idiot man cow.  He like wants to take one thing we did and make sure that's all we did. 
[02:44:00]  This is what they did.  Really?  I would put our clever stuff up against his.  We're going to get turd.  Oh my God.  Turd is in a car right now.  And he's going to drive it into a wall and set off the airbags.  Turd!  Turd!  Can you hear me?  That was you, idiot.  And then you would fake it, by the way.  And then fake the whole thing because you can't send a guy into a fucking wall so he'd be in another studio.  With sound effects.  With sound effects, pre-recorded stuff.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  That phony bit.  Easy. 
[02:44:30]  Sex in a church is easy and it's evil.  I don't want to get into that.  You brought it up.  But should they be off the radio?  Well, you know, it's a tough call for me because in a free society, we have to have everything, don't we?  And you don't have to listen to Sean Hannity or Mankow Muller.  That's right.  Or Opie and Anthony.  My personal taste, I'm fine with them back under the rock from where they came.  But should they have a right to do it in a free society?  Under the rock, we were syndicated into more markets than you were and in major markets. 
[02:45:00]  Where are you broadcasting to right now, Mankow?  Where's his big fucking market?  Peoria, I think.  Peoria.  That's where he is.  That's the biggest market he's in.  He has to rent a studio in Chicago because he's not being heard in Chicago anymore.  Yeah, he got thrown out of Chicago.  So he has to rent a studio to be heard in these tiny little who cares.  Yeah, so he can keep his name alive.  How about L.A.?  And he's doing public broadcasting television.  He's doing like a little segment on PBS. 
[02:45:30]  You know the channel that does the telethons to raise money so you can get a fucking tote bag if you send the money?  He's on that.  You're just, you're flying.  And yeah, we used to have the same agent.  And look what happened to you when you fucking fired him, asshole.  Good job.  Well, he was pissed off because Bob wasn't syndicating him.  Yeah, wasn't syndicating him.  Bob was trying to syndicate him, but there were no offers.  No one gave a shit.  No offers were coming.  The Peoria was coming through.  So this idiot decided to go get another agent. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, and that worked well.  Didn't it?  So you don't like to be compared with, quote, shock radio hosts?  No, because shock is shock for the sake of shock.  It's, I'm going to kill a Girl Scout to get attention.  I have always, look, man, I'm telling you, look at the TV, look at these happy phones.  But wait a minute.  Do you worry when you're attracting men 18 to 34, wait a minute, and you're doing all  your sex stuff when you do it on the radio, are you concerned kids have the ability to  listen to man cow?  I don't do that much. 
[02:46:30]  No.  Yes, of course I'm concerned.  I don't want children to listen.  And I tell parents, when they tell me, oh, my family listens, I say, you know what, you're  a bad parent.  It is, there's a hundred different radio choices in Chicago.  My idea of shock is talking about how Clinton was a rapist.  You're not one of them now, douchebag.  Having Juanita Broderick on.  That kind of a thing that got me labeled as a shock jock.  Now, what got you labeled as a shock jock is having a sidekick named Turd go out and  do outrageous stunt boy shit fucking hack radio. 
[02:47:00]  That's what labeled you a shock jock, jerk off.  Do you think Hannity will ever be labeled a shock jock no matter what topic or subject  matter he covers?  It's because of the way he does it.  He can cover sex.  He can cover violence.  But his program and the way it is isn't going to label you a shock jock.  We get labeled shock jocks because of shit we did.  We have to accept that.  I'm not going to sit there and go, well, you shouldn't call a shock jock.  You know, obviously we don't like the term because we do other things. 
[02:47:30]  But I can understand why that label is put on us, especially by people that aren't familiar  with the program.  Mancow can't even fucking fathom that or see why he's labeled shock jock.  You're fucking blind.  You had women crawling naked through mousetraps and you had people get their genitals stung  by wasps.  So they're going to label you shock jock.  I don't mind the shock jock label.  Why?  Because that's what people like.  That's what people grasp onto and say, look at what they do. 
[02:48:00]  They don't look at the other shit you're doing for 99% of the time, which is just cracking  jokes, having fun, talking about our lives growing up, talking about what we do for whatever.  Poopy jokes.  Yeah.  Things like that.  I know.  But they label you shock jocks because of the things you get that we call the attention  getters.  Yep.  You know, that's the stuff people go, holy shit, did you hear the guy getting his nuts  stung by bees?  That's going to get attention.  It's part of the job.  It's part of what we do.  But Mancow can never fucking, he hates it so much because he wants to be Hannity. 
[02:48:30]  He wants this respected fucking thing that you'll never get, man, cunt.  I'll go further with that.  He wants to be either Hannity or Howard Stern.  Yeah.  Instead of just being Mancow.  Right.  See, you can say what you want about us, but we're being Opie and Anthony.  This is what we do.  It's all we are.  Sometimes you're going to get the dick jokes.  He wanted to be Howard Stern.  It didn't work out for him.  So now he's like, well, I'll change my act and now I'll be the new Sean Hannity.  Yeah.  You want to hear a clever joke I thought of but didn't say? 
[02:49:00]  Please.  Oh, this is, I hope everybody's settled in.  Okay, I'm strapped.  The only way Hannity would be labeled a shock jock would be if he endorsed Hillary Clinton.  You couldn't even get shock jock out.  I couldn't.  Shock jock.  That was God trying to intervene and save me from humiliating myself.  President Kennedy was shocked.  He died.  He died on the table.  Jerk.  It happened in Dulles and Jerky leaned over and tried to grab his brunes off the back of the care. 
[02:49:30]  I'm a can't.  God damn.  You hear me fucking for timing trying to tap my wall, my fucking almonds?  Like that'd help?  Like it's a fucking scat beat?  Trying to get your rhythm together?  Yeah.  Shock jocks.  I yuck a time.  You're the worst.  But, um, I don't know.  What did Steve think of that joke?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  All right. 
[02:50:00]  Most people come to say...  Yeah, we did that one, right?  You want to continue with Mancow?  Yeah, let's hear that fucking blowhard.  Radio stunts turn bad.  The party is over for Opie and Anthony, as we've been discussing.  You know what's great?  A blowhard.  I love the old terms.  Wow.  You blowhard.  You're all full of hot air.  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  You know what's great?  The opportunists came out of the woodwork when we fucked up.  Mm-hmm.  And Mancow, man, you know, he just was standing by to comment.  Oh, just waiting for his expert commentary.  All day long, he was just standing by to comment.  Now what happened?  Him and the fucking Greaseman.  The Greaseman never met us and probably never heard our show.  But, man, he was an expert that day.  He didn't brutalize the show, though.  He was just like...  He actually said something correct.  It'll be a couple of years before they're at the helm of...  But I think he said that you guys will be back.  I think they'll be back. 
[02:51:00]  In some capacity.  Water doodles.  How did he not capitalize, that dumb fuck?  I know.  Thanks, sweetie pie.  Salsa's come.  I hope so.  Radio stunts turn bad.  The party is over for Opie and Anthony, as we've been discussing.  Radio show canceled.  Just for fun.  Sex stun in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  And now that the plug has been pulled, will we be seeing kinder and gentler shock jocks?  Joining us now from Chicago.  Nationally syndicated radio talk show host, Mancap. 
[02:51:30]  Mondo Jobless.  That's very funny.  Who said that?  The listeners do our work for us.  Billy Batts from Whack Bag.  That's not his real name.  Of course it's not.  Trying to send in feedback right away, you're getting fucking fresh.  Oh, the Grease Man was on O'Reilly.  All right.  We got a few.  Do you guys mind if we continue with this?  No.  It's the anniversary.  How many years?  Four years.  How do you not continue?  You have to talk about it.  Four fucking years. 
[02:52:00]  Well, we did it today.  And then a week from today, we finally got fired.  I still remember in 2003 with Ope being in Montreal.  I think we met Brother Weez and how fucking depressing that time was.  We were like less than a year in.  It was July of 03.  We had no idea how much time.  Every call from Bob.  It was a fucking nightmare.  Let down.  Bob called TV.  It was just every time reaching for straws, hoping.  It was to love something so much.  And have it taken away.  Holy shit.  Infinity wouldn't let us work. 
[02:52:30]  It was just a mess.  It was really a truck.  Hearing these fucking talking heads and dickbags like Mancow just bashing us, lying about our  fucking career and not being able to answer to it because we couldn't talk.  It was just depressing.  Well, look.  The worm has turned for you, my friend.  That's right.  Whatever it means, I agree with it.  Turning worms make me car sick.  I want to always win in the end.  We came up with that way before we got fired. 
[02:53:00]  And man, when we were sitting out for over two years, I was starting to not believe that one.  Well, I know they're looking at me to replace Howard in a lot of the markets.  Were they, Mancow?  Were they?  We got the inside scoop on that.  Yep.  You were calling them and leaving messages.  You were calling the top, top brass at CBS, leaving message after message, crying for the  fucking job.  The job that we got, douchebag.  And what happened to you?  You lost your fucking Chicago gig. 
[02:53:30]  Incompetent.  Do you think other radio guys are mad that you guys got that spot?  After all the shenanigans, and then the satellite radio, and then, dude, out of nowhere.  They hate us.  Let's do the timeline.  Out of nowhere.  Oh, God.  We wrecked it for everybody and then stepped into the void.  But there's even, we were in the shock jock genre, pretty much at the top of the shock  jock genre.  We fuck up.  We fuck it up for everybody.  Other people get fired, and everyone else got their balls taken away. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  So they were miserable.  Then we'd go to satellite, where all these guys wanted to go, because that's where the  freedom was.  Yeah.  But their phones weren't ringing, because they weren't going to go and just hire a bunch  of shock jocks.  They were going to be very careful with who they hired.  Right.  Hence, and we were available, because we didn't have a contract.  Hence, the hiring at XM Satellite Radio.  And then regular radio gets so bad, they have to bring us back over there, even though XM owns  us to save that.  Yeah.  These guys hate us.  Oh, they can't stand us. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, can they not stand us?  Think there's going to be more commercial markets?  Could be a couple of more, Jim.  We're up to it.  I don't even know.  I know we're over 20.  I just want, I think 21.  I think 21, 22.  We're over 20.  Bob is predicting at least 40 by the end of the year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's what we're looking for.  All I care about is Calgary.  I want Calgary.  Hey.  You had a dream, my friend.  And I want Duluth.  Duluth.  Duluth, Minnesota. 
[02:55:00]  You've got to slow down with your dreaming, Jim.  Because I want to perform in Duluth.  Duluth.  All right.  So, man, Cal, was this like a shot across the bow of radio everywhere?  What do you mean by that?  What do you mean by that?  I mean, are guys all over the country who looked up to Opie and Anthony?  No one did.  Why are they chastened now?  You know, I don't think anybody looked up to Opie and Anthony.  I've got to be honest with you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There he goes.  I did.  This guy was so fucking jealous of what we were doing.  By the way, I study speech patterns. 
[02:55:30]  Like, when Howard says, I don't care, I don't care, it means he really does care.  Right.  When someone says, I've got to be honest with you, they're not being honest.  They're not being honest?  No.  I've got to be honest with you.  I think you're right.  Our comedian friends would go, but...  Pulling a Captain Kirk thing where smoke is supposed to come out of your...  The Paradox.  I remember back in the day when we were syndicated and our comedian friends would come in.  Adam Ferrara, in particular, would go to all these...  I've got to be honest with you.  I can't stand that fucking guy.  I've got to be honest with you. 
[02:56:00]  I love him.  Oh, you prick.  I've got to be honest with you, Jim.  I don't want to suck that cock.  I've got to be honest.  I was really glad that joke didn't bomb.  Because when you paused...  You paused.  You took a moment.  He cooked a banana through me.  I was going to go banana or cock joke.  And I made a cock salad out of it.  No, you were trying to figure out the math in your head.  Yeah, he really was.  What should I say?  Wait, I want to make it... 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Do I need that cock?  Or do I not need that cock?  He accidentally showed all work.  Yeah, he showed all work.  Adam Ferrara would come back to any W and do our show and say how all these radio shows  said hi, big fans, all that.  Really liked what we did.  So when he says, I've got to be honest with you, he knows there was a buzz out there with  the other radio shows.  Are they chastened now?  You know, I don't think anybody looked up to Ope and Anthony.  I've got to be honest with you. 
[02:57:00]  I think it's like, do other corporate guys look up to the Enron officials?  I think these guys were bad eggs.  They did look up to the Enron officials until they had sex in a church.  What a dumb example.  They really looked up to him.  They looked up to the Enron officials.  They loved them.  Like, holy shit, look what these guys got away with.  Kinds of cash.  I wish I thought of that.  What an idiot.  Of course they looked up to him.  He tries to inject...  They just didn't want to get caught like the Enron guys did.  He tried to inject a little intelligence into the conversation, like, look how smart 
[02:57:30]  I am.  I know about Enron.  Shut up, Duluth.  Other corporate guys look up to the Enron officials.  I think these guys were bad eggs.  Opium Acne, not a fan, didn't like him as people.  And I think this is as easy as it gets.  And what scares me is the woman, you got that email, Karen from Michigan, you put that up.  Let's get rid of all of them.  The fact is, you know, Dan Rather called what I have to say, hate radio.  They call Bill O'Reilly hate TV.  What I do is not shock radio.  I have an opinion. 
[02:58:00]  It doesn't go along with the liberal media.  And so therefore I'm labeled a shock jock.  No, you fucking dumb shit.  He actually thinks he's on the same level.  I don't like Bill O'Reilly, but he thinks he's on that level where people don't like him  because of his political views.  Being dangerous.  No one is looking at Man Cow thinking, I don't like him because of his right wing views.  They don't like him because he has a guy named Turd go out and do radio stunts. 
[02:58:30]  And he's a shock jock and talks about sex.  You're in the same fucking boat, you dumb shithead, as other shock jocks that get fired  like Bubba for the pig thing or the other guys in Atlanta for leaving the mic open and  talking to a stripper.  Dr. Laura.  Oh, Dr. Laura.  Oh, Dr. Laura.  What?  I've got to be honest with you.  I don't know what to say now.  Go take on the day. 
[02:59:00]  But you're in the boat with those people and with us.  We were in that boat.  That's where you are, Man Cow, you asshole.  Be fucking honest with yourself.  Oh, do I hate this guy.  With the liberal media, and so therefore I'm labeled a shock jock.  Look, I study being a minister, John.  And these people having sex in a church, they're filthy, they're animals, and I don't like  being lumped in with them.  And frankly, I don't think they should ever be allowed to work again.  Oh, well. 
[02:59:30]  Wait, what happened?  I'm sure how you said that it's a tough call.  Yeah, tough call.  But now, I don't think we should work again.  Right.  Sorry, Man Cow.  Not only are we working.  We're working again.  We're in Chicago.  You're not.  And you're not.  And that was your hometown station.  Oops.  And now we're taking your old listeners.  And they're becoming fans of our show.  Do I hate this guy?  You know, at one time or another, back in my ancient history, there were some fairly bright  lines in radio that the FCC had painted. 
[03:00:00]  They're not quite so bright anymore.  Or maybe after this, they are.  I mean, look, I guess that whole sex in a church thing I had planned for Monday is done.  You know, look, the line is very blurry.  I mean, guys have always complained about that.  I don't know what your experience was in radio.  But the lines are some, there's a lot of gray area, but one thing I know, I mean, for  God's sakes, let's just think about this as a human being.  You're in New York City, sex in a church.  I mean, the Catholic's a pretty big group in New York there. 
[03:00:30]  Stupid.  It's just stupidity.  They're getting the old shwong.  We got a special report.  Yeah.  So could you shut up?  Stop your babbling.  Clinton's getting another blowjob.  Will you shut up?  Well, and what kind of blew me away about this deal was, as you know, on Fox and Friends  in the last day or so, one of the guys that works here also works on that.  Stupid psycho Mark.  Do you want to hear that again?  Stupid psycho Mark.  We can have, it depends how long you want to do this. 
[03:01:00]  I don't want to hear Mark again.  That blithering idiot.  Needless to say.  Needless to say.  He was our expert.  To be honest with you, he was smart on that.  Yeah, they're negotiating right now.  With Clear Channel.  They were in Detroit.  Ah, they're going to be back on the radio within a month.  Oh, really?  Are we?  Fast forward to...  26.  26 months later.  Thank you, Jimmy.  We're on XM.  Could you front me some cash if I'm going to be working in a month?  Way to go, psycho Mark. 
[03:01:30]  Needless to say.  On that former show.  Said they had been told, and they sent these people out to do the stunt, don't go insane  in St. Patrick's.  And when they called in, they said, we're at St. Patrick's.  And these two guys said, go on in.  It just kind of makes you wonder, what were they thinking?  You know what they weren't thinking?  And I mean, again, this is the problem with being lumped in with these guys.  You know, should we get rid of Russia on the radio?  Should we get rid of Sean Hannity?  All of these shows are being lumped in, and I just don't think it's fair. 
[03:02:00]  These guys are dirty.  They're not.  When did they lump it right?  They didn't lump it on Sean Hannity to us.  Again, because he's trying, because he knew he was in the same fucking genre as we were.  He knew that.  So he's trying to expand it to these guys that are doing the type of radio he's dreamt of doing,  which is, you know, legitimate right-wing talk radio.  That's what he wants to do.  That's Mankow's next fucking, you know, he thought that was going to be the next step for him. 
[03:02:30]  Ain't working.  So he tries to pull it all together.  Look, see, I'm in this category.  No, you're not shock jock.  Unemployed shock jock.  Don't think it's fair.  These guys are dirtbags.  I know these guys.  We have the same agent.  No, you don't know us.  He doesn't know us.  You don't know us.  We had the same agent.  We never met.  Your stories about us meeting, all fucking lies. 
[03:03:00]  Your speech to Bob Eatman, our agent that we had in common at the time, was,  Bob, could you get these guys and me together for dinner?  I want to meet them, sit down and talk.  And me and Opie said, no, there's no way we're fucking sitting with that cunt.  He wanted to fly us to Chicago and have a big steak dinner because he wanted Infinity Broadcasting  to hire him because he was miserable in Chicago with the company he was at at the time.  And we were really big in the company. 
[03:03:30]  It was us and Howard, and I guess I'm his too.  We did have a lot of power until he fucked up.  So he figured, well, steak dinner with Opie and Anthony will help my cause, and then they'll  give the good word to the boys back in New York, and then they'll hire me.  And we said, no fucking way.  The guy's a liar.  And then the other thing is, when we did get fired, he tried to hire our staff because  he knew we had such a great radio show.  So he figured, well, if I hire their staff, they'll make my show better.  They all got the phone calls.  The comics were getting the phone calls.  We have never talked to the guy. 
[03:04:00]  We've never been conference called with him.  Nothing.  He called wanting us to meet with him, and we said to go fuck yourself through Bob.  Tell him to go fuck himself.  And he winds up telling Bob to go fuck himself after a while.  And now he's in great shape.  But to say he's met us and he knows us personally, that's just bullshit.  Have the same agent.  That's the only thing I feel bad about.  I don't want my guy to lose money over these two jag-offs, as we would call them in Chicago.  You know, they're bad guys.  Say la vie, goodbye.  Don't lump everybody in with these idiots. 
[03:04:30]  Jimmy, we're going to do that after the break.  Don't even spoil it.  It's a great bit.  We have the audio, too, right?  I just read that.  We got the audio, two tracks.  It could be, we're having a really good show today.  That could be the showstopper, as you can listen to Jimmy in the background.  What a bunch of dopes.  Opie's really quiet on Line XM.  What is that?  How does that mean?  How is that even possible? 
[03:05:00]  Anthony's talking a lot.  I'm being loud.  Maybe I'm making things gate out.  Let's back up here a little bit.  Everybody has bosses.  And the FCC is the boss of the radio station owner.  Right.  And the owner is the boss of radio station management.  So what are managers saying today, now that they've seen this can get so ugly?  Here's the thing.  And I do want to bring up something very important.  And it does relate to your question.  I don't believe that we need more government.  I mean, all of us have had to deal with the DMV or the post office. 
[03:05:30]  It's a disaster.  I don't think this is a case of big government.  I hope not.  I hope there's not a witch hunt.  Because, you know, who will be next?  But I think the people have spoken.  I think it's community standards.  And the people of New York said enough is enough with these guys.  My conversation with my managers, they know I'm never going to have people having sex in a church.  I mean, listen to what we're saying.  Listen to the fact that we're debating this.  Is it so many years of Clinton that we even debate this?  They had sex in a church.  You're done. 
[03:06:00]  You don't deserve to have the tool of radio anymore.  Goodbye.  See you later, losers.  Don't let the door hit you on the ass.  All the way out.  So I'm feeling a little bit of debating this.  And what are managers saying?  To me, they're saying nothing.  Because they know I would never do something so stupid.  Whose door?  Whose ass?  Who's stupid now?  That door says Chicago on it.  Who's stupid now?  One of the reasons we're syndicated all over the country now is because this event made our names bigger. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Made our names bigger, you dumb fuck.  Whether you agreed with it, didn't, thought it was right, wrong, were ashamed of it, weren't, whatever, whatever.  The homeless guy on the street today knows who we are because of that.  He knew about it.  He hasn't had a radio in a decade.  Go suck turds dick, you fucking lion sack. 
[03:07:00]  One of the best stories I ever heard was when Danny Bonaduce tells a great story about punching man cow in the fucking face in a parking garage.  And now man cow tried to hide behind his chick that he was with at the time.  And he was taller than the chick.  So Danny just went right over the girl's head and punched man cow right in the fucking face.  He's like a karate dude, right?  And laid him out.  Oh, yeah.  He's a problem, right?  Danny?  Bonaduce is a fucking, like, he can fight.  Oh, you don't want to fuck with him. 
[03:07:30]  You want to be on his good side.  He's got the roids, too, man.  He's an animal, right?  Oh, he's ridiculous.  And he's funny.  He's genuinely fucking funny.  And he's a psychopath.  And he tells a great story about an on-air argument that got a little too personal.  And when he finally did see him face to face, he had told him, you know, over the air and through phone messages and stuff that he's just going to fucking, I'm going to kick your ass.  I'm going to fucking kick your ass.  So when they finally saw each other in a parking garage, man cow just kind of freezes and moved his chick in front of him. 
[03:08:00]  A fucking great move.  And Danny just goes, hey, that your chick?  And then he, like, said something bad about man cow's girl that he was with and said, look, what's your fucking man doing about what I just called you?  And man cow's just saying nothing.  And he reached right over the chick's head and punched man cow in the face.  And as he's knocked out, man cow is knocked out cold. 
[03:08:30]  Danny grabbed a sharpie or he had something and outlined his body in the parking garage so it would be there for a few days so he could point that and go, that's where Danny was laying when I fucking knocked him out.  That's where man cow was laying.  Or man cow was laying when I knocked him out.  Hysterical fucking story.  That's wonderful.  Why don't you tell that one?  You lying fuck man cow.  Ugh.  This week, a couple was arrested for having sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York.  It's part of a radio contest put on by two local DJs, Opie and Anthony. 
[03:09:00]  Hey, they sound wacky.  Can I see a picture of these two people who bonked?  And all I can say is they've got bodies built to f*** on radio.  I made it.  All right.  What's next?  Getting a rim job on the Jefferson Memorial?  Wheezy, of course.  Not George.  And, uh...  I mean... 
[03:09:30]  Where do we go from here?  Turning tricks on the police scanner?  Cunnilingus with semaphore flags?  I mean, seriously.  Semaphore flags?  What's the world coming to?  How about a little anal at the Acropolis?  That is a privilege reserved solely for priests.  No.  What are semaphore flags?  I thought he did.  I can't.  That's what you guide an airplane in with.  That's what you signal from a ship with.  Is that what it is?  But cunnilingus with them, how does that work?  Half his audience laughs because they don't want to... 
[03:10:00]  Semaphore flags?  They don't want to look stupid?  Was that a Monday Night Football joke?  I have no idea.  I don't care.  Jesus.  And Rush Limbaugh on Monday Night Football.  I'm so glad that show is folding.  Dumb cunts.  There you go.  I mean, we can get a little taste of O'Reilly,  and then we can move on to some current stuff today.  Oh, this is where he talks about sexually harassing a fellow employee  with a loofah sponge and a hard-on?  Tell me how big his cock is.  Yeah, let's remember that story that happened after O'Reilly had a lot to say about it. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, right, right.  We remember that, where he paid off a woman.  So during a court case that she alleged he had called her and had phone sex or tried  to, made suggestive sexual fantasies on the phone about loofah sponges and fucking this  woman.  And there you go.  Wow.  Here's Mr. Fucking Morality.  Our top story tonight.  Syndicated radio shock.  I know it sucks after that big setup, which was great, Anthony. 
[03:11:00]  Yes.  I applaud you for that.  Who was that?  He was on vacation.  Okay.  It was still called the O'Reilly factor, but someone was sitting in.  God damn it.  Top story.  Bill's not here.  Right.  I mean, we should pre-listen to someone.  It was four years ago, and I have a mental block of the whole fucking thing.  I don't want to think about it.  Jocks.  Opie and Anthony have been kicked off the air. 
[03:11:30]  This clip has the grease man, though.  Yeah.  He had a lot of fun.  What a doodle.  Fired over this sex stunt they pulled inside St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Last week, the duo broadcast an eyewitness account of a couple having sex inside the church,  and yesterday, they were officially canned.  Bill O'Reilly interviewed the pair recently, and they insisted they're careful to never cross the line.  Right.  Here is that never-before-seen interview. 
[03:12:00]  Never-before-seen interview.  Because we, they did the thing on the downfall of the American youth or the corruption of the American youth,  and we were part of that, but a lot of shit was edited out.  A little insight, we got the attention of, like, the media and TV and stuff,  but we were just two dummies from, I mean, we're from New York originally.  We were stupid.  But we came from Boston, and we were definitely still green and naive,  so we thought any time the news called, we should do it. 
[03:12:30]  So we sat down with Bill O'Reilly.  He talked to us well over an hour, tape rolling the whole time.  We're saying some good stuff.  We know we're saying good stuff.  After the interview, we're walking back up toward 57th and 7th, thinking,  man, that went really well.  Yeah.  How you compared religion to this and that, and we were showing some intelligence.  Yeah.  Stupid us not knowing how this works, where they tape you for an hour, hour and a half,  and wait for you to say all the dumb stuff.  Then they cut it down.  They cut out all the intelligence stuff. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  And I'm not trying to make excuses.  I'm telling you, we had no idea back then.  You would just talk about everything.  Well, they would also just cut out anything that made your point of view.  Right.  And then they would leave in the stuff that reinforces their point of view.  Right.  And that's what he did.  Well, his angle was that all we did was sex stuff.  Right.  So we took this hour and a half and made sure there was a lot of clips about us talking about sex.  Sex.  Sex.  The people you work for, the big operation, the big radio operation, do they care what you say on the air? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, without a doubt.  We have due every day.  We have guidelines.  We have SEC rules we got to adhere to, and we do a very good job at that.  Well, you skirt it.  You're smart.  Yes, you skirt it.  We're very smart.  We know where the line is, and we tiptoe on the line, of course.  We know at this point what our audience likes.  We know how to do it, and that's what we give them.  Well, what do they like?  What do they want?  They like to be entertained and traffic.  They like to.  Be specific, though. 
[03:14:00]  You do sit.  Wait, wait, wait.  You do sit.  Oh, wait.  We know what our audience likes, and we give it to them.  I want specifically what they like.  Okay.  You know what men like, Bill?  No.  Talk about sex.  Talk about sports.  Talk about entertainment.  Hanging with their friends.  About sex.  TV shows.  Talk about sex.  No, that's number one.  There's sex in there, sure.  We wouldn't consider sex number one on our show.  No way.  No way.  Every time I tune in.  The media likes to pigeonhole it. 
[03:14:30]  Well, women.  Every time I tune into your program, there's a babe taking off her top, or there's a discussion  of lesbians.  They listen every day, Bill.  You see?  You see what I mean?  Yeah.  Every time I tune in, there's a sexual theme.  I'm not hearing the ball scores.  If you took sex out of the...  Two on the nose.  Wait, how's that for a score, you fucking asshole?  How about two behind the loofah sponge in the lawsuit?  What do you think of that, shit dick?  What do you think of them?  Apples.  Yeah, fuck you.  Yeah. 
[03:15:00]  The winner, woman.  Right.  She won that game.  I wish I knew her name.  It'd be a lot funnier.  Yeah.  He's about to say something very dramatic.  Uh-oh.  Here he comes.  He's good.  And this statement has now been proven wrong, by the way.  Oh.  Coming in, there's a sexual theme.  I'm not hearing the ball scores.  If you took sex out of the Opie and Anthony show, you had a lot of dead air, you know  what I mean?  Really?  Really.  Is that true?  Really.  Take sex out?  I, um...  So unless we have girls in here shoving fucking wiffle ball bats in them, or we're just taking 
[03:15:30]  their tops off, like you said?  Yeah.  We're just sitting here looking at the door waiting for the next naked...  That's it.  ...naked chicken.  We have nothing else to give the people.  That's it.  We're just whistling and humming and going...  No!  You can't even do that.  It's got to be dead air.  Oh, so it's what Bill said.  We're not even smart enough to tap the film.  No.  Is it dead air?  Nothing.  It's just, um...  TV.  Hi, Bill.  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:16:00]  Can you tell us what we can do?  We're not talking about sex, and we don't work...  It's dead air.  Excuse me.  And we're going to get fired.  Excuse me, Bill.  We've run out of sex stories.  Could you tell one of your sex stories?  That should fill up some time on our show.  Something about a loofah cock?  And a co-worker?  That's...  You got to give money to or something?  Something like that.  Tell that fucking story.  Don't call him, because Fox Security will trace you on the phone. 
[03:16:30]  Right.  A faggot.  We have your number, your name, and you will be getting contacted by Fox Security.  And then by me while I jerk off to your voice.  You creep.  Fuck off.  No, we don't.  We fill it up.  We fill it up.  Without any sex?  Sometimes we go weeks without doing anything.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  I'm talking about on the air, not off the air.  No, on the air.  It goes in stages, and we'll even check ourselves.  And I'll go to Ann, you know, Ann, we're getting a little too much sex on the show lately. 
[03:17:00]  Let's back off, and then we'll...  This is easy.  Sex is easy.  You know it is.  You cannot be successful in this business just doing sex every day.  So, should the shock jocks have been fired for their latest stunt?  Joining us now are Bob Peters.  Bob's the president of Morality in Media.  Great.  That's the guy you want.  We're here for or against the show.  Someone's saying, what do you think of them apples?  Way to show them, Opie. 
[03:17:30]  What do you think of them apples?  In media, and in Washington, Doug Track, he's a radio talk show host.  He's known as the Greaseman.  The Greaseman.  Well, Mr. Peters, why don't you react to the decision to fire these guys?  Well, I think it's great.  In two respects, I think they merited being fired.  They should have been fired a long time ago.  But I regard myself as a political conservative, and I say, you know, one of the best ways to, you know,  reduce the size of government is to reduce the need for it. 
[03:18:00]  And with corporations, even after a long delay, do the right thing, there's less need for government.  So I'm glad Infinity Broadcasting, for once, has done the right thing.  Mr. Track, you've been caught in situations where you've actually lost your job because of some things that you've said on the air.  Because of the coons.  Yes, the Negroes.  Said something about dragging behind trucks, and then I was out of a job. 
[03:18:30]  You're right.  But he's going to be, he's going to tell the world that we're dirtbags.  Silly jibigaboos.  Jesus.  Doug Tracked.  Where you've actually lost your job because of some things that you've said on the air.  How do you feel about this decision affecting these two guys?  Well, when you think about it, with some of the stuff that's gone on in churches already,  maybe they should be looking on the bright side.  At least the people in there were of age and heterosexual.  I wish they'd fire some of the priests that get caught in having sex in church as fast as they fire these guys. 
[03:19:00]  Cricket, cricket, cricket, cricket.  Cricket, cricket, cricket, cricket.  Yeah, I wish you...  Let me go for the obvious joke here.  That is the church here.  Pedophile.  Pedophile priest here.  Oh, wait.  Fired.  Tumbleweed.  Oh, good.  Hey, I like that, Jimmy.  Holy sound guy.  Wait, come back. 
[03:19:30]  It hits something.  Yeah, it got windy.  Fire these guys.  But when you hire a show like that...  Some of them may end up in jail.  The priest.  Well, let's hope so.  That'd be a great thing.  When you hire a show like this that's more based on stunts, pranks, going over the edge,  this is the kind of thing that you have to watch out for.  I try to do a show that I paint pictures, I use the language, I do words, but if you  have a show...  Paint pictures.  ...that's going to be...  Can you top...  Pictures that are bought by Klan members.  You painted a hell of a picture that day. 
[03:20:00]  A hell of a picture.  A lot of charcoal in that picture, huh?  Let me use...  Let me go into the black.  Let me use a little alizarin crimson for the blood.  Anyone know how to draw a pickup truck and a chain?  Paint pictures.  You sure painted one, painted a big one, didn't you?  Just because you didn't like Lauryn Hill.  Yikes.  Nice.  All these guys trying to claim that they're better than everybody else.  Yeah.  They're all in a different category. 
[03:20:30]  We were all in the same boat, jerk-offs.  There's a show that's going to be, can you top this with the nearest naked man jumps into  hot chocolate, somebody amputates a pig on the air for entertainment value.  You have to keep going to the next level and the next level and the next level.  And I think these guys were doing what they were paid to do.  It's like a wife that cooks and cleans and does everything for you.  She breaks wind in bed one night, boom, she's out of there.  Punch her in the face.  These guys were doing what they got paid to do, and companies that hire this kind of  show have to deal with the burning remnants of the aftermath. 
[03:21:00]  Remnants of the aftermath.  He couldn't help himself.  I believe those two had to be corrected.  It's pretty funny that he's talking about responsible radio and he does a hack priest joke.  Oh, yeah.  And a fart joke.  And a fart joke and rolls his R's like his character.  I can't do that.  And then tries to defend himself by saying he paints pictures.  It's a picture, all right.  Yeah. 
[03:21:30]  He uses the blood of the colored to paint his pictures.  There's a sickle cell on my pictures.  I wish I could do it like I can, but I can't.  You are a doodle.  The show have to deal with the burning remnants of the aftermath.  Well, Mr. Peters, he makes, in some sense, a good point, which he says is that the management  told him to do it.  Of course, if the management told me to do that kind of stuff, I wouldn't do it.  Of course, because you're better than everyone.  Does that then mean that the management itself ought to be held accountable?  Just make sure that dead people are shown on your shots, on your news shots. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, really.  That's all.  Management tells you that, don't they?  Management tells you things like, if it bleeds, it leads.  Right.  They tell you that.  But you're better than us, right?  But, yeah.  Because someone tells you you're not going to do it, right?  Exactly.  Sure, you won't.  Self ought to be held accountable, but perhaps they're license suspended, they're license  revoked.  How do you feel about that?  Well, I tell you, I mean, my concern about revocation is that the FCC simply has not been  doing its job in terms of upholding the public interest standard for broadcasters. 
[03:22:30]  And then all of a sudden, literally probably out of decades of doing, taking no strong action,  suddenly they're going to try to revoke a license.  I mean, had the FCC been doing its job all along, in my opinion, this would have never happened.  But even if it had happened, in such a circumstance, the FCC would have been well within its rights,  in my opinion, to pull the license.  Mr. Track, these guys had a three-year, $30 million deal that they signed in June 2001. 
[03:23:00]  We did?  We did?  Boy, I'd like to see some of that money.  Wow.  Holy shit.  I certainly would like to see that piece of cake.  I know where that figure came from.  Yeah.  Obviously, we were doing well.  John Minnelli.  Yeah.  As we keep it real on this show.  Fucking John Minnelli from the New York Post, who I do like.  He's a friend of mine and a friend of the show.  He asked us how much money we were making with our new syndicated deal.  It was the day we signed it. 
[03:23:30]  Right.  We did an interview with him about the fact that we just signed a new deal with Infinity Broadcasting.  We pretty much said it was none of his business.  So we're in Ken's office on the conference call with him, and he asks, how much is the contract for?  Right.  And we didn't answer that.  So then he figured it out in terms of what Howard was making.  Yeah, something like that.  He had some kind of equation, and he decided that's what we were making, which was nowhere's near.  It was ridiculous.  When we read it.  We were doing well.  You know, yes.  Well, yes, of course, we were doing well. 
[03:24:00]  But nowhere's near what was quoted in the paper by John Minnelli, because he did a little math equation.  And no one liked that better than Bob.  Bob, our agent, was just like, this is great.  He goes, you know what?  They're going to have to pay on the next contract.  If they think.  We never got to that next contract.  No, we didn't.  They signed in June 2001.  Now, these guys had been in Boston.  I understand they were in Boston.  I've been told that they were fired because on April Fool's Day, they went on and said that the mayor had been shot and killed, and they lost their jobs. 
[03:24:30]  Shot and killed?  What?  This is Fox News.  They totally got that wrong.  This is the National Enquirer, you ass.  All you had to do was Google our names.  It was a ridiculous April Fool's gag that he was killed in a car crash in Florida with such wacky circumstances that we never got into.  Under such wacky circumstances that it was obviously an April Fool's joke.  And this guy reporting that we said he was shot and killed. 
[03:25:00]  Can we sue this guy?  He was in the car with Kennedy.  Yeah.  And he was shot in the wrist.  And he dropped his Stetson.  He was shot and killed.  The magic bullet hit his big fat tongue.  They went on and said that the mayor had been shot and killed, and they lost their jobs.  Then they come to New York, and they sign a deal for $30 million.  Is it likely that after this, they're going to go somewhere else and sign a bigger deal? 
[03:25:30]  Well, let's face it.  What they did was probably in bad taste.  And every now and then, you can make a mistake on the air.  Lord knows I live in a glass house myself.  The deal is, I don't think they'll come back to the major company.  But it's well alarmed because of the Negroes.  Don't want them breaking into my glass house.  Did you hear him bring his voice down for that?  Well, I live in a glass house.  God knows.  I know.  I shouldn't throw stones living in a glass house.  But I'll sling a little lead.  If a coon comes to my door, he's a goner. 
[03:26:00]  Yes, they've got to live with the burning remnants of a cross on your lawn.  What a doodle.  What an ass.  He's coming back to Washington Radio, by the way.  Is he?  Yeah, we're going to have fun with him soon.  Welcome, Greaseman.  I don't think they'll come back with a major company right away because major companies  are afraid of protests and people wandering around and shareholders getting nervous and  stock prices going up and down.  But I think in time, if they've learned from this brutal acid test of what works and what 
[03:26:30]  doesn't work, they can find a local station with an owner with some guts and probably resurface  back to where they were.  Or XM.  Mr. Peter.  I am the great Karnak.  Look at him, fucking Kreskin.  The Kreskin man.  What a doodle.  Pick a card, any card.  Press the digitation.  He's a magician.  The guy figured it all out. 
[03:27:00]  He knew.  Pick a card, any card.  Oh, look.  It's a spade.  Yeah, a spade.  I take them all out of the deck.  Don't even like looking at him anymore.  What a doodle.  Here, Peters, what impact do you think this kind of radio has on young people?  Well, I'm a media watcher, and I don't know how many times over the last several years I've  seen articles specifically on the decline of civility in the United States in public life,  affecting people of all ages.  And I don't say I've never read an article where the impact of media hasn't been mentioned, 
[03:27:30]  but it would be the exception.  I think most people attribute, at least to some extent, a decline in civility in public  life, affecting people of all ages.  Wait, decline in civility?  Like when women couldn't vote, or blacks were hosed, and had to drink at different water  fountains, you fucking dumb cunt.  Yeah.  When we thought homosexuals were a disease.  Were a disease, criminal, prowlers, predators.  Henders, and when pregnant girls were sent off to abortions over state lines with hangers. 
[03:28:00]  Or how to just live somewhere else.  Or how to live somewhere else.  These are the good old days we always talk about.  The decline of civility.  So they were civil back then.  Get out of my yard, nigger.  I can't, boss.  That's very civil.  Yeah, civil.  Lovely society.  Bored listener from North Carolina.  Yes.  Yeah, how much longer are we going to have to listen to this shit?  As long as we want to fucking play it.  And you know what you'll do, boy?  You'll listen. 
[03:28:30]  That's right, boy.  So that means every year at this time we have to listen to this shit.  That's right.  That's right.  In 365 days you're fucked again.  Okay, well I'm going to mark it down on my calendar.  You should do that.  Right after, fuck my sister and find a job.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  I love you, man.  Thank you, mister.  All right, get out of here.  He loves Jimmy.  But who can't?  Bored listener is not his real name.  Houston improv all weekend long.  Atta boy.  Big jokes coming.  To some extent, a decline in civility in public life affecting people of all ages. 
[03:29:00]  Now, if it can affect some of us adults.  Yeah, it's popular, isn't it?  It's hard to understand.  Well, you know, I live in New York City.  And, you know, Howard Stern, to my knowledge, is the most, quote, unquote, popular radio talk  show host in New York City.  But, you know, out of the people who are listening to radio in New York City area, it's about  to quote me from a minute from now.  Ninety-three percent of radio listeners don't watch Howard Stern, listen to him. 
[03:29:30]  And I don't listen to radio, so I don't even count.  This track, very quickly, I want to give you the last word here.  Does this affect young people negatively?  Do you, why is it so popular?  I don't think it affects young people negatively.  I think negative young people are attracted to this.  I think nowadays you have people on the air who really necessarily can't create magic,  so they destroy.  They break things up.  And I think there's enough disenfranchised people.  If you look at some of the music videos, some of the junk that's out there where people 
[03:30:00]  are throwing up and breaking things and smashing and dying in wrecks and dismembering themselves,  I don't think this affects people.  I think it just draws the already offbeat crowd into a house of fame.  I want to thank you for both of you gentlemen for being with us.  This may be the beginning of a significant change on the radio.  We'll have to see.  Certainly will be.  Croudy.  Oops.  Yeah, well, I'm sorry.  We'll be here to fill the void.  That's right.  That's four years ago, and there was some major changes that went on, and now we're 
[03:30:30]  back to save the day.  And by the way, we do create magic on this show.  Watch.  I saw this retarded baby, so I fucked it.  Ta-da!  The aristocrats.  Hey, we'll stop there for now, but tomorrow, can we play?  We have to play the last segment we did before we had to sit for 26 months.  Oh, wow.  The last segment on the air.  And some other things, maybe. 
[03:31:00]  I got to take a piss.  And coming up, by the way, not to interrupt you, but we have a new thing we're doing on  this anniversary.  It's called Sex with Sam.  It's where we all line up and stick our dicks in a wide-footed mulatta.  What is it all it's about?  He's throwing his huge arms up in the air.  Yeah, look at him.  Oh, my God.  Boy, that's going to make us think you're white.  A black man with rosacea.  I don't like his rosy cheeks.  He's like a gibbon with those arms.  I don't even know what a gibbon is. 
[03:31:30]  And I like that joke.  Those monkeys with those giant long arms.  Fucking gibbon.  Watch the way his feet point out when he walks.  I want to just block them like a Japanese woman and figure his ass.  I don't know how that ties in, but it makes me feel better.  Samuel.  Also, remind me.  Seriously.  Someone out there, remind me.  I swear.  I've never heard this, but the Ron and Fez stuff.  Yeah.  You called Ron and Fez.  What's the HRL broadcast?  Hmm.  Oh. 
[03:32:00]  You don't know.  I do.  H-R-L.  And then he does.  Hourly.  And then Ron and Fez did a Remember ONA Part 1 and Part 2.  Oh.  So we'll play all that tomorrow if someone reminds me.  Nice.  And Cousin Ed, I remember, went on the air and played Rage Against the Machine, and people  thought that the show was back on.  Yeah.  But he was just, no.  Fucking with it.  Yeah, that was great.  That was a hurtful.  Remember, I remember walking into-  The same Cousin Ed that made me sit outside his studio for an hour and a half the last  time I was in Philly?  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks, Ed.  I walked into Ron and Fez's show after we got the boot over at NEW, and I was used to 
[03:32:30]  doing, we used to do the Afro shows.  We used to just both go in there and hang out and do their show.  And I had to just stand there and watch them do the show, and I couldn't get on mic or  anything.  It was so depressing, because it was so much fun to do.  So, and then it's just like, no, I can't go on the air.  It really is fucking over, you know?  Yeah.  Just go home and sit for two fucking years.  Yeah.  All right.  So, we'll do-  Yeah, there.  We'll do a little more tomorrow.  Not as long as we did today, but we'll do about 20 minutes tomorrow on this, if you  remind me, okay?  We got some good stuff to play, but we'll play one more newscast going into break. 
[03:33:00]  We'll take a break.  It's a picture of a gibbon.  That's a gibbon.  Look at how long those arms are.  Isn't it like, what was it, What's Happening, the band that sang was the Gibbons Kids?  Do you remember that?  That was the name of the band.  Was it?  Yeah, Bubbling Brown Sugar.  Bubbling Brown Sugar.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,  Bubbling Brown Sugar.  No clue.  No clue.  No clue.  The Gibbons Kids.  It was the Gibbons Kids?  Yes.  All right.  Make up your own-  That was the name.  I understand. 
[03:33:30]  You could whatever you want to do at home.  Guys, we're going to need to have-  Whatever the grease man wants to do.  All right, you got it.  All right.  I got a-  I got a tinkle and wash my strawberries.  Hold it for me.  Can I do the tease?  No.  Can I just read the headline?  No.  No.  Jimmy, you read the headline.  All right.  Teacher accused of tricking, molesting teenage boys.  Wait till you hear how he did that.  We got audio and everything.  So as we go to break, one more newscaster today, and we'll go back to this tomorrow. 
[03:34:00]  Another sex scandal in the Catholic Church tonight, but this one involves a radio stunt.  Three people are under arrest for having sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral while radio fans listened in.  Why would anyone want to do this?  Well, Alita Lopez is live right now at St. Pat's to explain.  Alita.  Katie, Opie and Anthony, the duo from 102.7 WNEW, has long been known for their antics,  most recently for having a voyeur bus filled with barely clad women cruise around Times Square. 
[03:34:30]  Now, that got a lot of press from City Hall.  But tonight, sex in public place and stunt that got all the way here to this holy place may have gone too far.  Now, police say 37-year-old Brian Florence and 35-year-old Loretta Lynn Harper, both of Virginia,  were arrested for having sex on a vestibule outside St. Patrick's Cathedral  during the live Opie and Anthony show this afternoon around 445.  A security guard discovered the pair and 42-year-old Paul Mercurio of New York City, 
[03:35:00]  who was working with the station and apparently was on a cell phone relaying the act on air.  Tonight, the trio are at Midtown North Precinct, and the couple is charged with obscenity in the third degree,  Paul Mercurio, for acting in concert.  Now, the incident today was part of the radio show's Sex for Sam contest, seen here on this website.  It challenged people to have sex in public places Thursday, August 15th.  Today, with a spotter from the show tagging along.  Now, couples will accumulate points for where and who was involved in these acts. 
[03:35:30]  The couple with the most points, the prize, was a trip to Boston.  Now, again, tonight, the trio is in the Midtown North Precinct and is expected to be arraigned tomorrow morning.  Now, police also tell us that Florence, the man from the couple caught in the act,  was also taken to St. Clair's Hospital to get prescribed medication for, of all things, a back pain.  Now, no comments tonight from St. Patrick's Cathedral or the radio station. 
[03:36:00]  We're live tonight at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  I'm Lolita Lopez for the WB11 News at 10.  Peter, back to you.  All right, Lolita, the prize was a trip to Boston.  Go figure.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come.  Here we go.  Walk-a-walk-a.  Do it sweet.  Fuck it.  What the fuck is that? 
[03:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  Oh, yeah.  I can't believe it.  Are you insane?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God damn.  All right.  Say what again?  Come on, say what?  What?  Stop the fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, stop! 
[03:37:00]  Oh!  You look sweet!  Fuck it!  Hey!  Oh, hey!  Oh, hey!  Oh, hey!  Back, back, back it up!  All right. 
[03:37:30]  Let's say hi to John in Texas.  John, what's up today?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Uh, good.  Good.  Hey, I just wanted to tell Jimmy we're coming to see him this weekend,  and I'm bringing my fiancée who's hearing impaired.  And so he has to speak really clearly so she can hear every disgusting word he says.  Okay.  Is that okay?  Sure, I don't mind, man.  I have a lot of hearing impaired people show up at my shows.  She's hot, too.  Cool. 
[03:38:00]  Burden!  Hey, you guys are awesome.  Thank you very much.  You make my drive these much better.  All right.  You should just shout one of your jokes.  I'd love to.  Just a megaphone.  Just for her to go, oh, we see there's a deaf person in the audience today.  You know what's always funny?  When a comic does act and has a woman on the side signing all the other jokes.  That really makes it funny.  Nothing says comedy.  Yeah, and whenever he says the word cunt, she's just a point of herself.  Teacher accused of tricking, molesting teenage boys. 
[03:38:30]  Page one.  Greatest sentence ever written, by the way.  The first sentence?  How can you not love this guy?  You know what?  I'm not going to risk it.  It's just a...  If I mumble through it, it's going to...  It doesn't matter.  Nope.  I refuse to do it.  It's the story, not the...  Nope.  Wait a minute, I...  Nope.  What the hell?  Where's the...  I'm going to be missing somebody.  Oh, no.  Oh, where did I...  It was on top.  Oh, where's mine?  It was on top, but I...  Now it's all... 
[03:39:00]  It could be...  Where'd it go, Fanny?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  It's somewhere, but it's not...  It's right there.  It's right there, dude.  There you go.  Anthony, why did you read the first sentence?  Uh-oh.  Why?  Uh, from Waltham, Mass?  Mm-hmm.  Good old Waltham.  Prosecutors said a middle school teacher allegedly lured students to his home to test a female masseuse, 
[03:39:30]  then blindfolded them and sexually assaulted them while wearing a wig, prosecutors said.  How do you not love that guy?  To test.  I got a female masseuse, and then he blindfolds them and throws a wig on.  How do you not love this guy?  So he would get, like, guys?  Teenage boys.  Okay.  So he'd invite teenage boys over.  Say that he was testing this female masseuse. 
[03:40:00]  Like, hey, guys, I got this female masseuse.  I'm not sure if she's any good or not.  I'm testing her out.  I've tried her.  She seems pretty all right, but, you know, I want other opinions.  So why don't you come over and check her out?  It's like she's good for sports, like, massages, things like that.  Lay down.  Look, you're going to have to wear a blindfold because I think the visual stimulation, if you see the girl, it's not very attractive.  There's a reason for that.  Why?  You have to read on.  Yeah.  It gets better.  Oh, really?  I was speculating.  I don't know how dumb these kids are. 
[03:40:30]  All right.  Robert Dacey, 49, a drama teacher.  Of course.  Oh, boy.  It's always a drama teacher.  At the McDevitt Middle School, an assistant coach of three sports at Waltham High School,  pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Monday in Waltham County Court.  Two counts of child rape, two counts of child enticement, and one count of indecent assault and battery.  He's in Dutch.  Why is only some of that highlighted?  I'm just going to read it.  Authorities say he repeatedly raped and assaulted one boy who is now 21 at his Waltham home 
[03:41:00]  over the span of several years.  Wow.  Beginning when he was 14.  God, when was he going to speak up?  Dacey's also joking.  How many times did he get tricked?  How many hot female masseuses are continually putting a baton in your asshole until it bleeds?  Haven't you picked a masseuse yet?  Six years into it.  Wait a minute.  I think something's going on here.  It was like Dressed to Kill.  He kept seeing Bobby leave the office last time.  He met all three boys through his role as their teacher or coach, prosecutors said. 
[03:41:30]  Dacey allegedly persuaded the boys to come to his house by saying he would pay them 50  bucks to allow a mafia masseuse in training to practice on them.  What the hell is a mafia masseuse?  That's why you need the blindfold.  It's brilliant.  She was probably something.  She's going to massage the mafia.  What an awful.  A mafia masseuse in training to practice on them, the prosecutor said.  He would cover their eyes with duct tape.  I got it.  I jump in here. 
[03:42:00]  This drama teacher, brilliant.  Yeah.  Because, you know, you read this stuff in court and it's like, who would believe this?  Who's buying this?  You're obviously smoking something in between classes.  That is great.  A mafia masseuse in training.  But don't these kids wonder why, A, is she training with my creepy drama teacher and why  does she want to massage me and then jerk me off or blow me if she's going to massage  the mafia?  Well, the mob does like getting jerked off and blown.  But why doesn't she just practice on them?  One of their capos.  Because, God forbid, she does something wrong, then she could get whacked. 
[03:42:30]  Why doesn't she massage Tessio's feet?  I'm sure they're sore from the little girl standing up.  Oh, great.  Dell battery recall.  That should help my stock.  Good luck to you.  He would cover their eyes with duct tape and blindfold them under the guise of protecting  the masseuse's identity, then perform the massage himself and sexually assault them. 
[03:43:00]  I'm trying to tickle your balls and right away you're getting fucking fresh.  Jesus Christ.  And if you close your eyes, he leans over and sucks your dick.  You'd think he was the real person.  I can see how a 14-year-old retarded boy could fall for him.  And you're trying to bang this drama teacher.  Oh, look at him.  Oh, it's Nick Nolte.  It's fucking Nick Nolte with a Down Syndrome hairdo.  Oh, he's the greatest. 
[03:43:30]  Look at this guy.  Oh, he's the fucking...  Oh, wow.  I love him.  What a...  Dude, they all look like this guy.  What a fatty.  Wow.  They all look like this guy.  Oh, he's the greatest.  He might want to spit out all that sperm.  Oh, what a beaut.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  No, he wasn't.  He was the greatest priest of the ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world. 
[03:44:00]  Let's see.  Where were we?  Okay.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Cowbell Bill.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hi, Bill.  Hey, listen.  I got a question for you.  They just got to use duct tape on their eyes?  Yeah.  Did anybody in the school question why the entire wrestling team had no eyebrows?  What the fuck?  Yeah.  You know?  Good point. 
[03:44:30]  Good point, Bill.  All right, fellas.  Good talking to you.  Later, man.  Hi, sweetie.  There goes Cowbell Bill.  Then he would perform the massage himself.  Where are we?  Go back to the mob here thing.  Yeah.  Oh, duct tape, blindfold.  Okay.  Duct tape, right.  The prosecutor said the alleged victims recalled a woman's hair brushing them while they were  blindfolded, but that the hair actually was a wig worn by Daisy.  So he put this long wig on, and in order to complete the ruse, as he's massaging, this 
[03:45:00]  hair would brush along the backs, I guess, or fronts of these boys.  Or if he should have his back rubbed by a fat transvestite.  And I'm going to blame some of the people in this room.  And then I do not tip. 
[03:45:30]  Look, he started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  And what did he say after the little guys came?  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Oh, that's not right.  How's the massage of this place?  Try the fat drama t-shirt.  Best in the city. 
[03:46:00]  Hold on.  Nice massage, Lou.  Are you a man?  Maybe.  Bill O'Reilly taking in.  Bill?  This is Bill O'Reilly.  Here I am listening again, and here you are talking.  I'm talking about six again.  Bill went down south for a little bit.  You sound a lot stupider today, Bill, than normal.  All right.  What else we got here?  All right.  Let's see.  Yeah, the wig worn by Dacey.  The 21-year-old told police that Dacey told him the same masseuse story when he was an 8th grader, 
[03:46:30]  but was able to see that the person entering the room was, in fact, Mr. Dacey,  wearing a black woman's wig and fake temporary fingernails.  Wait, is that a black woman's wig or a black woman's wig?  It's not like a big wig.  Like fucking...  Do you have extensions?  Yeah, I think a weave or something.  He had his hair.  Pull that goddamn weave off your head.  Has bail only 25 Gs. 
[03:47:00]  And he has to stay at his sister's home.  Stay at his sister's home under house arrest to wear an electronic monitoring system.  He's also ordered to stay away from schools, children under 16, and the Internet.  Pat, it's tragic all around, said Mayor Jeanette McCarthy, chairwoman of the school committee.  Did he fool that kid for seven years?  How fucking much training does he think a masseuse goes through?  What, do you think the mafia masseuse just wants to jerk him off?  Let's go to Chicago, Chi-town.  George, what's up? 
[03:47:30]  Hey, I take some duct tape, a wig, a little oil, and that's my trick.  What's that?  Pumenza making the sauce.  Come on, you might have to jerk off a whole bunch of guys one day.  Finger nails.  Let's go to the story.  A popular Wolfram teacher finds himself getting a tough lesson in the law.  He is accused of raping students, past and present, and he could be released from jail this morning.  7 News now live outside Middlesex County Jail in Cambridge. 
[03:48:00]  Lauren Frisbo is there.  Lauren.  Jeff Robert-Daisy was a middle school teacher.  He was a drama teacher at McDevitt Middle School in Waltham for 20 years.  He was also a coach at the high school.  But now he's locked up in this jail, and he likely won't be in front of a classroom anytime soon.  He was good.  He was good.  I'm surprised, you know.  This student knew Robert-Daisy from football, but now many people around Waltham are talking about this long-time teacher for his alleged sex crimes.  Daisy said nothing to reporters outside court. 
[03:48:30]  He said nothing inside court either.  Authorities saying the 49-year-old drama teacher and assistant football coach lured two 14-year-old students to his apartment in Waltham last year many times.  He allegedly told the teens that he needed their help in training a masseuse for the mafia.  But investigators say there was no masseuse.  The massages were done by Daisy himself, which then escalated into sex.  Into sex.  Into sex.  Wow.  Did he wonder why the massage lady was fucking him in the ass? 
[03:49:00]  Why he had to suck her cock?  What a dumb kid.  Nick in Wisconsin.  Nick.  You don't go to a man like Mo Green dressed up in a wig and what?  Like that.  Yeah, Mo sitting on the massage table.  One of the students got his eyes shot out.  Fredo, you're my drama teacher and I love you.  Here's a great one.  Casper in Connecticut.  Casper.  Hey guys, was he wearing a Maury's wig?  I want my handjob, Henry.  Fuck him, that cigarette hijacking Mick. 
[03:49:30]  Draw handjobs for everybody.  Todd in Ohio.  Morning, boys.  Are you doing sugar shorts?  Hey.  Uh, I got a little pat from Warnock, Warnock, Warnocky joke for you.  All right.  It really was a drama queen.  I don't know.  Chris in Jersey.  No, no.  I thought you said, check him off, Spider.  I got you on the last bag.  I want to get full credit.  All right. 
[03:50:00]  Thank you, buddy.  That's really funny.  Check him off, Spider.  Uh, let's see.  Blah, blah, blah.  All right.  More to the story here.  The suspect's sister was in court, and if her brother posts the $25,000 veil that he's being held on, he's been ordered to live under house arrest at her home in Belmont.  Dacey will have to wear an electronic monitoring device on his ankle.  Neighbors aren't too comfortable about this.  Just get him out.  Get him out of here.  It's definitely an unsettling feeling.  Police say there is a third victim who's now 21 years old. 
[03:50:30]  The former student is saying that he was being paid by Dacey for his silence.  Some of his former students that we talked to said they aren't surprised by these allegations.  He was just too friendly.  He would get really involved.  Like, he seemed to care too much.  Yeah.  No shit, huh?  I'm kidding.  Uh, Tim in New York.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  He's a fag.  All right, let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  What's going on? 
[03:51:00]  Hey.  I know how this guy gives the massages.  One hand goes that way.  One hand goes that way.  Guy with the wig going, what do you want from me?  Richie and B.  That drama teacher does not get a part.  Is that masseuse?  Richie.  He was teaching them how to go to the mattresses.  He was teaching them how to go to the mattresses.  Very good.  Not bad at all.  Leave the wig.  Take the fingernails.  That's a great one.  I'm glad we got that in today.  Oh.  How do you not love that?  A mafia lady is training the mafia. 
[03:51:30]  Like, what a hack reason.  It really is like a dramatic, over-the-top drama teacher reason for having a woman in  there doing that.  Like, he almost came up with like a script.  Like a story.  Yeah!  He was trying to jerk guys off with his father!  And the wigs.  They were your father's wigs.  If there's a teenager on the table, I know we have a deal.  Pass the wig around. 
[03:52:00]  We're bigger than U.S. Velvets.  Penis Wrinkle.  What's up?  Yeah, he was jerking off high school boys.  Do it at times.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  I love it.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Rob.  How are you doing?  I just wanted to thank Anthony's brother for coming out with Guitar Father. 
[03:52:30]  That's going to be what I'm going to be introducing my wedding party to.  For my wedding in 11 days.  Oh.  Well, congratulations.  Hey, we haven't played that in a while.  Why don't we end the show with that?  That's a good way to wrap up the segment.  Sure.  I swear to God, I didn't know he was a man, Mikey.  Mr. Motherfucker.  Hey, some nookers blindfolded me and raped my ass. 
[03:53:00]  All right.  That's a good fellow's line.  Oh.  In my neighborhood, we would leave the wig to the dramaturgers.  They're faggots anyway, so let them lose their souls.  Yeah, I saw a beautiful, very beautiful drama teacher with a wig and fingernails.  I don't know any drama teacher like that.  Not around here. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, I'm so happy.  They got the drama teacher by the massage table.  Now you've had your happy ending.  Look how he's jerked off my boy.  Put his pants back on.  I don't want his mother to see him like this.  Frank and Queens.  Come on, Frank. 
[03:54:00]  Go on.  Be a massage therapist just like your father.  Frankie, jump in.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Hey, Frank, you there?  Yeah.  No?  Hey, Frankie, five fingers.  Guido in Philly.  I'm going to go jerk off the kid.  Jerk off the kid.  Guido, go.  Jerome, Jerome.  I'm not going to blow him.  I'm just going to rub him.  Wow.  I guess it's time to go home. 
[03:54:30]  That's close.  Why should we let him sprawl all the fun?  I guess it's just time to go home.  Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be a woman masseuse.  Luke.  His name is Luca Brasi, and he massages my father.  Luke.  Now go home and get your fucking wig.  Five happy endings, and he's still alive.  Bob and Buffalo. 
[03:55:00]  I like throat yogurt.  I'm so pleased.  All right.  Why don't we leave?  All righty.  That was a fun show today.  Love it.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Tony in California.  Tony.  Hey, I was wondering if that teacher was telling me they were playing Mobster Rain.  Mobster Rain.  Not so bad. 
[03:55:30]  You're out.  Very good.  That was a good one.  All right.  Should we leave now?  Yeah.  We got good.  Yeah.  Don't have guitar.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Tom, can you jerk me off for all the time's sake?  Thank you, Danny.  That was a good one.  Let's go to Scott in Boston.  We're filling at this point.  We need to find Guitar Father.  E-Rock's on it.  Yeah, I got, how about some of the beautiful boys down at the drama club? 
[03:56:00]  What if he jerks them off behind the toilet?  I want my brother coming out of there with definitely his dick in his hand.  Some of the beautiful boys.  Yeah, he's trying again.  We got it the first time.  I just fell flat, so I don't need to pick it up and throw it back on the pavement.  Punching out.  Buffy, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see.  Hey, uh, this...  Ah, go shit in your wig. 
[03:56:30]  Can we get this tomorrow?  Because she's always terrific with her human interests.  Oh, right.  Who's that, CNN?  Uh, Julie Moser, what's her name?  What can you carry on board a plane now?  And she's talking about...  Knife or gun?  We give up.  No, I don't think those are allowed anymore.  But she's terrific with her humor and her human interests.  Yeah.  She has fucking...  She has hair like...  She has hair like Ozzy in 1969.  There's footage of them from Paris.  She looks just like Ozzy.  She should be singing War Pigs.  I don't know why I had to fucking tag it with that one. 
[03:57:00]  The Ozzy joke didn't get a big laugh.  The three War Pigs would get a standing ovation.  Fucking dope.  Tim, we end with you today.  What's up?  Let me use your phone.  Two messeurs just stole my truck.  Can you believe this shit?  Two messeurs just stole my truck.  And then he had to go,  Can you believe this shit?  Yeah.  Why, sir?  The other guy kind of had that line.  Just let it die gracefully.  That's what we do at this show.  We don't try to go out with a bang.  We just wither away  and suck until we're finished. 
[03:57:30]  The end.  See you tomorrow.  We don't try to go out with a bang. 
[03:58:00]  We don't try to go out with a bang. 
[03:58:30]  We don't try to go out with a bang.

[03:59:30]  We don't try to go out with a bang.  We don't try to go out with a bang.  We don't try to go out with a bang.  We don't try to go out with a bang.  We don't try to go out with a bang.  We don't try to go out with a bang.  We don't try to go out with a bang.  We don't try to go out with a bang.  We don't try to go out with a bang.  We don't try to go out with a bang.  We don't try to go out with a bang.  Thank you. 
[04:00:00]  Thank you. 
[04:00:30]  Thank you.  Shut up!  Who cares?  I can't believe you fell for that again.  Damn you, Hawk.  Damn you, Hawk.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. </pre>
