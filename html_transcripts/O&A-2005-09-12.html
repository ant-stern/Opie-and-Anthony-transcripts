<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a recap of a disastrous night out at B.B. King's Blues Club and Caroline's Comedy Club following an appearance with Ron and Fez.  The hosts, along with Jim Norton, detailed the extreme intoxication of their intern, Eric, who exhibited slurred speech, inappropriate behavior towards women, and complete memory loss of the evening.  Another Ron and Fez intern, Paul, was relentlessly and inappropriately clinging to Anthony throughout the evening, despite Anthony's repeated attempts to distance himself.  This included unwelcome close proximity and constant conversation, even during dinner.

Technical difficulties plagued the show, with phone lines initially malfunctioning and going straight to voicemail.  The hosts expressed significant frustration and anger towards the technical staff, particularly someone located in D.C., due to a lack of communication and perceived incompetence.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the ongoing online auction benefiting Hurricane Katrina victims.  Specific items up for bid were mentioned, including Anthony's skates and various Opie and Anthony memorabilia.  The hosts also provided updates on the death toll and recovery efforts in New Orleans, touching on the controversy surrounding the distribution and potential misuse of Red Cross debit cards. Listener calls further fueled the discussion about the B.B. King's event.

The Hurricane Katrina aftermath dominated a substantial portion of the broadcast.  The hosts heavily criticized the New Orleans mayor's response, playing audio clips highlighting what they described as "goofy laws" and bureaucratic inefficiencies.  They contrasted this with Mayor Giuliani's response to 9/11, emphasizing the perceived differences in leadership.  Audio clips from 60 Minutes, featuring interviews with the mayor and Lieutenant General Honor√©, were also played.  The discussion included the surprisingly low initial death toll, the destruction of the Superdome, the search for bodies, the slow and inefficient response from FEMA and local government, particularly in impoverished areas, and the high desertion rate among New Orleans police officers.  A caller, Darrell from D.C., accused the hosts of hypocrisy, alleging racial bias in their differing responses to Katrina and 9/11.  The hosts countered this, emphasizing the different natures of the events and their proximity to them.  The auction for Katrina victims was again promoted, with items like autographed DVDs and wrestling memorabilia highlighted.  The segment concluded with a staff member, Jimmy, reading humorous comic strips from the Daily News.

The broadcast also included a segment focused on their upcoming first anniversary celebration at XM, a large Halloween party on October 31st (Opie's birthday).  They played a highly offensive Stephen Lynch song, "Baby," and discussed an ongoing auction featuring various donated and listener-submitted items, including a used drill, Bob Kelly's Puma bag with a suggestive inscription, Jim Norton's laminates, and a tissue with Bob Kelly's snot. A significant portion covered the altercation between comedian Aries Spears and the hosts of a Miami radio show, playing audio of the confrontation.  The hosts, along with Bob Kelly and Jim Norton (who were in studio), extensively discussed Jimmy's injured foot, which had been repeatedly struck by a falling object.

A heated confrontation with Aries Spears was a central theme.  Audio clips were played of Spears' furious tirade, filled with racial slurs and threats of violence, following criticism of his performance on a Miami radio show.  The hosts recounted the incident, using offensive language, and highlighted Spears' sold-out show at the Miami Improv despite the altercation. The conversation branched out to past disputes with other comedians, including Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hammond, and their tendency towards more aggressive behavior when guests weren't present.  The segment also included further discussion of the auction, technical issues concerning a planned interview with Bruce Kelly, and the playing of another Stephen Lynch song; Bob Kelly, Anthony Cumia, and Ron and Fez were present in the studio.

Finally, a substantial segment focused on Earl, the executive producer of the upcoming Ron and Fez show. The hosts engaged in extensive teasing and mocking of Earl, targeting his perceived lack of preparedness and evasiveness regarding show content and guests. This included racial humor directed at Earl.  Potential guests, including Matthew Modine, the deceased Pope, and Amy Poehler, were discussed.  Jokes about Harry, a staff member, and his alleged involvement in bit-writing and suspicious keychain items were also included.  The hosts pressured Earl into giving an impromptu pep talk, which proved awkward.  The segment concluded with discussion of Earl's departure from a previous job and the lack of a farewell gift, and a final promotion of the Opie and Anthony auction. The overall tone was highly informal, irreverent, and filled with comedic insults and offensive jokes.

[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelch and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  These dummies at work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, he's laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  That is.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Bow to your sensei.  Bow to your sensei!  Okay, now watch this.  I'm just going to break the wrist and walk away.  Break the wrist and walk away.  Take a look at what I'm wearing.  You think anybody wants a roundhouse pizza?  I'm wearing these little boys.  A couple of very beautiful girls, huh? 
[00:05:00]  Who are you tonight?  The Kid Cat Club?  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want the tears to come out of my eyes?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  Yeah.  Hey, that's a great way to start the program.  Got some new ones.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Bye. 
[00:05:30]  Somebody has been fiddling with some knobs in the studio.  Is it knobs?  I'm so fucking annoyed.  Fiddling with the knobs?  I don't know.  I saw Mars in here earlier.  He was flipping switches and turning knobs.  It's all his fault.  That should be all right.  I guess.  It's a big day here on 202.  Ron and Fez start after us.  That's right. 
[00:06:00]  So we do our little thing.  And then at 11, instead of a replay, you get to hear another show on 202.  What a bang-up job everyone did.  Friday.  At BB King's, huh?  That was a crazy, crazy appearance, huh?  A lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  Yeah, we went down there to support Ron and Fez.  And wow.  Wow.  Turned into a real event.  Yeah, it was very, very cool.  And it was drunks.  It was fun hanging out with everybody.  Picture-taking.  Annoying people.  Cool people. 
[00:06:30]  A whole gamut.  As they say, it ran the whole gamut.  This picture is up on foundrymusic.com and opiananthony.com.  A lot of people got very, very drunk.  Oh, yes.  People that work for the program.  People that don't work for the program.  People that intern for the program.  People that intern for other programs.  People that usually sit next to Ope when Fez's not there.  I know a lot of people.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, he was hammered.  Eric is either the most raging alcoholic or the biggest lightweight. 
[00:07:00]  Ever.  Did he drink a lot?  He was drunk immediately.  He walked into B.B.  King's.  He was completely hammered.  Dude, if you try to defend the fact that you were hammered, if you try to say, I wasn't  that drunk.  No.  I know I was.  You were snoted.  Rumor had it you had like two and a half bottles of wine yourself.  I don't know if it was that much.  Really?  I just, I was sitting at the bar and the bartender was cool and just kept refilling the glass all  night.  Yeah.  Well, that's what they do when it's open bar and everything's for free. 
[00:07:30]  Well, he started talking to women.  We have some audio.  It wasn't that he was cool.  He had to do that for everybody.  Talking to some chick.  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore.  You know it.  See?  I mean, there's no reason for that.  Here I am, you lucky people.  He's all drunk and then somebody tried to tell him something.  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  Yeah, you were hammered, bro.  Absolutely hammered.  You know when Opie tried to pull him aside and tell him he was a little drunk.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared. 
[00:08:00]  Oh!  That hair better grow in fast.  Oh!  My favorite part is the back story he creates a half second before the clip.  Yes, I've got it.  It's a little back story.  Any of the boys want to comment on Eric's drunkenness?  Oh, look at them all.  They're fighting for the microphone.  They're running for microphones.  Holy crap.  Nathaniel, I was going to just give you this one.  Nathaniel jumped up and ran across the studio to get the free mic. 
[00:08:30]  Well.  No, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Okay, here comes the bus.  Go ahead.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Well, we were just, you know, when Eric first got there, he had a nice glass of red wine,  but he complained that it was room temperature.  It was too warm.  It's red wine.  That's what red wine is.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be.  He's a class act, this guy.  Put some ice cubes in it, damn it.  I had sushi with him once.  He's like, God damn it, they didn't even cook it.  It's so raw.  Send it back. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, you were so hammered.  And then, because at the end of the night, he was trying to talk, and that was just entertaining  as hell to watch.  You were all slurring your words and trying to make it sound like you're not drunk.  I just came over to say goodbye, and it failed.  It didn't pan out.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Didn't work.  All I remember is your finger in my face, and you going, ah, ha, ha.  Just laughing at me.  Ah, you are so drunk.  Did you get sick?  No, actually, I just don't remember getting home. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, how did you get home, though?  Were you told?  I probably took the subway and just got home.  That would have been good.  I never was.  A drunk white kid going back to Brooklyn?  Yeah.  I've been smashed in my life.  I don't get the whole, I don't remember getting home.  And then you ask someone, and they're like, yeah, I think it was the subway.  Come on.  I always remember getting home.  Is there a part of your brain?  Yeah.  There's a part of your brain, if you really thought about it, would say, all right, yeah,  I remember getting in a cab or what have you.  I remember the way I usually got home was probably a bad idea. 
[00:10:00]  A lot of people.  Shouldn't have been driving.  Yeah, but a lot of people go on blackout mode, and they swear they don't remember  what happened.  No.  I don't really buy that.  I woke up with a bunch of bruises all over me, too.  Did you?  And I don't know how I got them.  That was your asshole.  Fine.  Wait, let me see the one on your...  Who's that?  I mean, they're not big, but I got a...  That's falling into something.  Yeah, that's in a way.  There, I got it like here, here, and there's one on the back, so...  You fell down or something.  Had to have, probably.  And you really don't know? 
[00:10:30]  Honestly, don't know.  In fact, uh...  You don't remember getting on a subway?  No, the last thing I remember is when the event ended, and there were some guys in suits  saying, all right, everybody, you gotta go, you gotta go, and the guy came over to me,  he's like, you gotta go, okay.  I was walking up the stairs, and it was Saturday morning.  Wow, that is not cool.  That's a sign of a healthy night of drinking, when you just kind of lose 15, 16 hours.  Isn't that a biggie on the 12-step thing, like if you have blackouts?  Yeah, blackouts are a big one. 
[00:11:00]  That, because that's a blackout.  That's...  I am such a lightweight, though, I don't normally...  So that's gonna be your excuse for everything today?  No.  Including, uh, calling my girlfriend the meal ticket?  Oh, right!  What the fuck was that about?  Uh-oh.  And they're all jumping up and down, thinking, uh...  Oh, more people coming in.  Yeah, these guys didn't think I was gonna go there, but...  I can't let that one go.  Travis knows a little more about this.  No one understands what this means.  Yeah.  Do you remember calling Lindsay the meal ticket? 
[00:11:30]  It wasn't her the meal ticket, per se.  I didn't want to lose my paycheck, is what I said.  You used the word meal ticket.  No, Travis is already shaking his head.  Because she said meal ticket, she has no idea what you were getting at.  No, I said something, and it was me, uh, Lindsay, and Eric, and I said something, and Eric points  to her, and he's like, that's your paycheck.  And I said, that has a name, Eric.  Alright, then that's what I said. 
[00:12:00]  And why is she your paycheck?  I have no idea.  I would guess if she was dissed by you.  By either...  By one of the interns?  No.  Not the interns.  The young go-getters, we call them?  Yes.  The subordinates, that, uh, you'd be out.  And Eric knew this, and pointed and said, that's your paycheck.  That's wonderful.  That has a name?  I think I pointed out something that was...  Maybe somebody was talking to her, or somebody was bothering her, and I was just like, that's, 
[00:12:30]  you know, you gotta protect her, because she was right there, next to her.  No, I don't know.  No, that wasn't it.  I don't know why I said it.  I'm all your secret service men.  I was saying, in the case of Gumman runs in, that's what you save.  You take the bullet.  Travis, what happened?  I really don't know.  I said something.  I...  I...  We were just probably talking, and...  And Eric decided to chime in with his drunkenness, and tell me who my paycheck was.  For some reason, I don't know.  I don't know.  Paycheck. 
[00:13:00]  That's your paycheck.  There's a lot worse than you could have said drunk.  That's true.  That's a little weird.  A little odd, I'll agree, but that's not awful.  And I...  You know, while we're all in the studio here, I have to say, I hate Jimmy today.  Why?  Because you kept sending Eric over to me.  So what?  Well, he needed to talk to you.  You know why.  Well, he wanted to talk to me.  Do you remember coming over to me a lot?  Yeah, I was taking photos from behind you guys.  No, and...  He kept saying, Ope needs you, Ope wants you to get something, Ope wants you.  Yeah, over and over again.  I'm like, what?  And I would turn, and because it's really loud, there was, what, over 500 people in 
[00:13:30]  the joint.  I heard there was a line outside the whole time as well.  Yeah.  They were cranking up the music and stuff.  So Jimmy, I'm sure knowing Jimmy as well as I do, told Eric, make sure you get really  close to his ears because he can't hear in this environment.  No, I didn't actually.  I just said, Ope needs something.  No.  Holy crap.  Or Ope needs something.  Eric is like this close to me going, do you need something?  I'm like, no, I don't need anything.  Oh, Jimmy told me you needed something.  And this was going on the whole time I was at B.B. King's.  He was so drunk, he fell for it every time.  I'm like, dude, Ope's trying to find you. 
[00:14:00]  Where are you?  Fucking bumble.  Thinking he's doing a good job by being attentive.  Thinking he's on top of things.  Right.  Well, there was something more to that, Eric.  What?  Which was really driving me nuts.  And Jimmy knew it was driving me nuts, so of course he has to rub it in.  What?  The breath was a little weird at B.B.'s.  Oh, boy.  That was probably from the drinking, I would say.  Drinking and dry mouth.  Oh, boy.  I whispered to Jimmy, like, man, does anyone have gum?  I was just going to hand you gum.  But instead of being a casual thing, Jimmy has to keep telling you that I needed something. 
[00:14:30]  He said, go talk to all of them.  Jimmy had gum, and he went, and OPA says, can you give him a piece of gum?  And Jimmy goes, ah, no.  He can't just hand the guy gum.  It's creepy.  Another man handing another man gum.  He said that he had gum.  I would be like, yeah, take some.  I didn't notice, to be honest with you.  I didn't even.  So I guess it's, I'll tell you in front of the whole country, that was the reason that  Jimmy kept sending you over to me, because he knew it was bothering me really, really badly.  Well, it didn't bother, I hadn't noticed, to be honest with you.  But I figured, you know, I know how it is when someone drinks wine, and this wine breath 
[00:15:00]  is bad.  It just, the wine does something to you.  Yeah, I know.  It just fucking ruined you.  So I figured, all right, keep sending it over.  And I wasn't going to bring that up, but.  Why not?  As soon as I found out, you called, uh, Lindsay, the meal ticket, or whatever you said.  The paycheck.  The paycheck.  Did you have a, uh.  Jesus.  Bad hangover the next day?  No, actually.  Really?  Nothing.  What the hell is, how do you prevent that?  Wish I knew, but I got up.  Mayo?  Is that the way?  It's a good problem.  You've been helping.  It encases the alcohol. 
[00:15:30]  He is a good sport, because he brought in a book today about mayonnaise.  Mayonnaise.  Some kind of mayonnaise cookbook.  That amazing ingredient, mayonnaise.  That looks like it's from the 70s.  Yeah.  Look how old this book is.  And all the recipes and things you could do with mayonnaise.  Ugh.  For appetizers, for salad dressings, for salads, for entrees, for vegetables.  Just a spoonful.  That's all you need.  You don't need any pesky other ingredients.  Look at that, right on top of some ice cream.  Hell yeah.  Yeah, why not?  Tuna-stuffed mushrooms with mayonnaise. 
[00:16:00]  Yum, yum.  Give me some.  Good stuff.  What else?  Oh, yeah.  Crab-stuffed cherry tomatoes and mayonnaise.  Plenty of mayo.  Jeez.  Creamy curry dip.  Ugh.  Just keeps going and going.  Anyway.  Good stuff.  That amazing ingredient, mayonnaise.  Well, at least, at the very least, you weren't the only drunk there that night. 
[00:16:30]  Besides the listeners and stuff.  That goddamn new Ron and Fez intern.  Paul is his name?  I guess he starts tomorrow, so I'll lay into him tomorrow.  Holy annoying motherfucker.  This guy, Jesus Christ.  You know, our interns pretty much know.  I guess they listen to the program or something.  They know.  And they're briefed by Ben and Steve. 
[00:17:00]  When they come in, they know how to act.  And then once they earn, it's like the guys that come in the replacements in the NOM.  You know?  I don't want to know their fucking name.  They're just meat shields.  They're probably going to get killed.  I don't want to know them.  And then slowly, when they prove themselves, they end up like the wonderful fan sitting over here next to Opie.  Or all the fine staff we've gotten together in that room over there. 
[00:17:30]  Of course.  But when they're new, I don't want to get to know them.  Bill.  The new intern, Bill.  He's kind of growing on me.  He is a creepy son of a bitch, isn't he?  He has a five o'clock shadow right after he's shaved.  Bill's a creep.  Bill is a real creep, but he is a go-getter.  I don't know what to think of Bill anymore.  I like him a lot, but there's nothing in those eyes.  I heard he was down in Jack Daniels like my ex last night.  Really?  Just wham! 
[00:18:00]  There he is.  Actually, there's a little...  He shaved this morning.  There's a little life to your eyes today.  I like that.  A little bit.  A little life.  Yeah.  Because on Friday, man, I was looking at Bill going, wow, wow, there's no one home behind  those eyes.  I got really drunk.  I had about four beers and then three Jack Daniels because I knew the party was ending,  so I'm like, I've got to get drunk faster.  So I started throwing tens down, and that shiftless bartender only was able to give me three before  the whole thing ended.  Shiftless?  I know what the bartender looked like.  Now, the first Jack Daniels, I said strong, and it must have been 50-50, but really, 
[00:18:30]  I couldn't taste it.  Wait, wait, 50-50 is pretty strong.  And then the second one must have had, like, no Coke in it, and that's how I usually drank  it, and I had two of those, and then I was off wandering around Times Square for three  hours after that event.  What did you do in Times Square?  Just walked around drinking pole in spring.  I had no idea where it was going.  You were all hammered, looking at the pretty lights.  Looking at the pretty lights and seeing what tours you could take down.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  In the back alley.  Anyone missing from Times Square over the weekend?  The Oklahoma tourist?  What fat pig from Indiana is missing?  Bill also blacked out.  He woke up nude with a knife in his hand and blood between his teeth.  And I walked through the, uh, since this guy is a problem.  Oh, he's nuts.  Huh?  I walked past some restaurant, and there was, like, I guess celebrities going by because  it was all paparazzi, and I think it might have been basketball players because it  was just, like, tall black people powering over white people.  So I'm like, I just walked through the line.  I'm like, I'm a fucking celebrity.  I was screaming at that thing, and I just walked right through it. 
[00:19:30]  And I just kept going.  Then you realize they weren't tall black people you were just laying on your back.  That's, like, really all I remember.  That's very good.  Yeah.  No, see, Bill's probably not going to hurt anybody.  Bill seems to be a nice guy.  I really don't know.  Here's how Bill will finally, his undoing will be.  He'll be arrested drunk in front of a restaurant window just jerking off watching people eat.  That sounds about accurate.  That sounds about accurate.  I like Bill.  Yeah.  He's all right.  He's a good go-getter. 
[00:20:00]  Sure.  Built all those shelves and everything in record time.  People ask him to do something.  He goes and does it.  See, that's good.  He's proving himself, and that's all well and fine.  This new guy.  Before you start, Ant.  Yeah.  At this point, I would have to say, okay, they're now starting to ring.  We haven't had a phone call in the first 20 minutes.  That doesn't make sense, especially after a party.  Do you think the phones were broken?  Especially after a Ron and Fez slash O&A party.  These phones should have been all lit up.  So let's make sure the phones are working, guys. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  Go ahead, Anthony.  That's all right.  So the new guy, Paul, he's a new intern for Ron and Fez.  Not my first meeting with him, by the way.  There's a pool hall called Slate.  That I was at one night, shooting a little pool.  And he came up to me and asked about an internship.  And he was a little hammered at that point, too.  And, you know, it's cool.  I have no problem with that.  I shuffled off his email address to Ben. 
[00:21:00]  And I figured that's the way to go.  He was one of those guys, though, that kept coming over to the pool table and talking.  And then going, all right, dude, cool to meet you.  Thanks a lot.  And then shake my hand and walk away.  And then ten minutes later, he's back.  Oh, one more thing.  I just got to tell you that, dude, like five times he did that.  But all is well.  All is fine.  I don't care.  I was having a good time.  Everything's fine.  Well, then, he shows up at B.B.  King's and informs me that he's now Ron and Fez's intern, new intern. 
[00:21:30]  Great.  Congratulations.  The whole thing.  Everything's fine.  He gets hammered.  A lot of chit-chat going on.  But it's an appearance.  That's okay.  Again, fine.  After dealing with all the listeners, for how many hours were we there?  Now, and without trying to come off like a prima donna, I understand how this sounds to some people.  But here's just the way it is.  After that, we go to Caroline's.  All I want to do, because I know once we go into Caroline's, it's going to be a lot of the same thing.  A lot of listeners of the show and everything. 
[00:22:00]  That's fine.  So, I just wanted a little while to eat dinner.  So, me, my chick, and Big Kev sit down to have something to eat.  Well, here comes Paul and his girlfriend.  Sits down at the table right next to us.  No, he doesn't.  Yes, he does.  And just starts, again, all show-related stuff.  Big Kev sees what's going on, and he tries.  He goes, hey, no shop talk.  No shop talk.  Come on.  That lasted for about a minute. 
[00:22:30]  And then, ba-ba-ba, again, about Ron and Fez, the internship.  Now, my food comes.  And all I kept saying is, I'm so tired.  Oh, my God.  Am I exhausted?  Just as kind of a little signal thing, to no avail.  So, now I'm trying to eat.  He's still talking, and now he's getting like six inches from my face as I'm trying to eat.  So, I'm looking for help, and the fine people at Caroline's, I noticed Greg saw, a couple  of the other people saw, came over, and the first thing that Paul does when one of the 
[00:23:00]  guys come over is go, can I have a menu, please?  So, now he's going to sit to eat.  So, the guy that came over from Caroline's looks at Paul and just goes, sir, these tables,  if you want to eat, I could seat you, but these tables are all reserved already, so I'm  going to have to seat you.  So, he gets them up and moves him to some faraway table, because he saw that I was just in complete  distress.  I wasn't sure you were eating, I'm not sure.  I'm eating egg rolls.  Okay, finger food.  Finger food.  Egg rolls.  So, the final thing Paul does is stick his sweaty hand out to shake my hand. 
[00:23:30]  So, now I'm sitting there, because now there's a line for the bathroom and everything, my food  is sitting there, so now I've got to eat the rest of it with just my left hand.  I spent the rest of the night, Paul, thank you very much, eating my fucking food with my  left hand.  Unbelievably annoying, this guy.  He does not know intern protocol.  You don't fuck with the talent.  And he starts up with Rana Fez today? 
[00:24:00]  Tomorrow is his first day.  Tomorrow, okay.  But there was no way I was holding that in until tomorrow.  Dude, I so wish I was there to egg him on.  You would have, absolutely.  Dude, he loves you.  Why'd you sit over here?  No, that's not reserved.  Come back, come back.  He's been asking for you.  Oh, my God, he just had no clue.  He was all hammered.  You know what?  His chick had a clue.  At one point, I heard, when he stopped talking for a second, he turned to his  girlfriend, his girlfriend went, enough.  You're being annoying or something. 
[00:24:30]  And he was like, am I really being annoying from King of Comedy?  Dude, that's what I said, too.  I turned to my girlfriend, I go, this is the scene out of King of Comedy.  Right, right.  Where Rupert Pupkins, the chick he brings, is like, you're annoying him.  No, Jerry knows.  Me and Jerry go way back.  And the chick is on to it.  That's what it was.  And then the drunken stupor tries to overcompensate for being annoying.  Like, all right, I'll be unannoying now, and I'm going to come like me.  Right, right.  Oh, it was so bad.  It was so bad.  And, yeah, he starts tomorrow. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  What a crew they got over there at the Ron and Fez show.  Black Earl and this guy.  Great.  And instant feedback, my own bits, Harry.  Good luck to Ron and Fez.  What a crew.  Good luck to you.  Good luck, bro.  Sit and sail with that crew.  You should be on the rocks in minutes.  Well, this is a drag.  The phones are not working.  Oh, no.  It's very obvious now.  And we really need them today, so.  Yeah, we love the phones. 
[00:25:30]  Why don't we, I don't know, why don't we take a quick break here.  Are they going to reboot them?  What's going on, Mars?  You know anything yet?  Jerry just puts his shoulders up.  Here's the deal with the phones.  All right.  Programming issue because they have to share the same lines that Ron and Fez are going to use.  So I guess apparently when they went in there and configured the system to go to them after 11, they probably forgot to do something.  Forgot to put the phones back for the show that's on in the morning.  But why wouldn't they? 
[00:26:00]  Oh, my God.  How could that even happen?  Wouldn't they test it first?  How could a phone be configured?  You know how our phones shut off at 11?  Right.  Now they're set to go on at 11 and shut off after Ron and Fez's show.  Like whoever was doing it thought we were fired, gone, and Ron and Fez are in, and that's...  How does somebody configure a phone without putting it back the way it was?  Who did that?  Who did it?  I'm clueless.  I want a name.  And how long does it take to get it back? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  He's working on it right now.  Is that the same guy?  Yes.  Where is he?  Who is he?  Who is he?  Who is he?  Who is he?  Where is he?  Where?  Where?  He's got to stand tall before the man.  He's in D.C.  Why?  I thought he was out here.  No, he's in D.C.  I was ready to kick some ass.  Wow, I've never seen Anthony get up to kick some ass.  Dude, I can't...  Because no one actually tells people anything.  They go through emails, meetings, that...  It's not some guy in some guy's face going,  Hey, fucko! 
[00:27:00]  Put the phones back!  That's what I was ready and raring to do.  Why is it so complicated?  Why can't they just keep the phones on?  Keep them on.  Why do they have to shut off?  What does it matter?  Are they afraid?  Stop geeking up the goddamn radio station.  What are they saying?  This is stupid radio.  The easiest job in America.  Stop making it complicated.  The phones should just stay on.  Why do they have to turn off for us and then turn on for Ron and Fez?  What is it, a whole other program?  That's going to just be a nightmare as we move forward.  Just keep the fucking phones on. 
[00:27:30]  What's the big deal?  Yeah.  It's a fucking phone.  Leave it on.  All day.  So now no phones.  Oh, oh.  Mars is on the phone.  I just want to clear.  The phones do work.  What it's not...  What's working is that it's going straight to voicemail.  Our voicemail.  That means they're not working.  I want to go.  Hello.  That's not working.  Paul in Boston.  What do you have for the show today?  I got you.  That's not working.  That's not working? 
[00:28:00]  Is there a time frame?  Time frame.  For it to start working properly again?  I don't have one.  He's working on it right now.  How long does that have to...  How long does that have to wait?  What is it?  Isn't it a switch?  He's not under there with a wrench.  No, it's almost like writing code.  How much code does he have to write?  What is with all this code?  Do you hear when they talk about the board and stuff?  Yeah, we wrote some new code.  What the f...  Flip a switch.  This is the worst day not to have phones. 
[00:28:30]  After a big appearance like we had Friday, the first hour of a radio show writes itself.  Everyone calls in.  Hey, did you see later in the night when this guy was getting head from this chick?  And, you know...  And they remind us of things we missed.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  So we'll just have to sit and wait, I guess.  Maybe they'll be up soon.  I see one that keeps flipping and then going off, so maybe they're starting to get through.  Goes to voicemail.  Oh, God.  Someone's asking, Opie, did the phones actually explode today? 
[00:29:00]  Very good.  Very, very good.  And it sounds like XM's marketing department is working the phones.  Yes.  It's true.  Oh, God.  Did, Anthony, did Paul give you a picture of his pride and joy?  God, I wish I had...  You don't know how much I wish I could have seen that.  Oh, of course you do.  Anthony was probably quietly eating and just, uh-huh, uh-huh, just looking down, not wanting  to look up and be rude.  You would have been reveling in this.  Yeah.  You would have loved it. 
[00:29:30]  It wouldn't stop.  I tried.  And then, you know why Caroline's finally sent someone over?  Because I, at one point, I leaned over and laid my head down on those bench seats, making  it like, oh, I'm so tired, like, like, take the hint, I'm not talking, I've been doing  this all day at an appearance and wanted a few minutes, just a couple of close friends  and some food. 
[00:30:00]  That's all you wanted.  That's it.  You had to fake laying down?  I had to fake laying down.  Like, I was sleepy.  I was sleepy at the club.  At Caroline's.  So you're just too nice, I think.  You know, if Club Soda Kenny was there, I was like, God, I wish Kenny was here.  I'll give and give and give, but then when it gets to the point where I know the guy's  not getting the hint, I'll just turn and just go, what?  What do you want? 
[00:30:30]  Exactly what I do.  That would have worked well.  I'm not even kidding.  There's a point where a switch goes off and it's like, okay, now you're a problem and  I'm going to tell you to your face.  But Anthony's too nice.  Anthony keeps going with the, well, I'll make believe I'm tired.  I thought he'd take a hint.  Anthony got some lumber and actually built a little door in between.  And he knocked on it.  He wouldn't stop knocking.  Oh, hello. 
[00:31:00]  And starting today, you've got to work on having the reputation of being an asshole and your  life out there is a lot better.  I know.  A lot better.  It's just so wonderful.  I can't.  I appreciate the whole fan thing.  We all do.  And that fan thing is one thing.  This guy is now going to be in here on a semi-daily basis.  The guy's going to be walking around here.  He's going to be in the office.  Am I going to be sitting in the office now trying to do something maybe in the morning  or something? 
[00:31:30]  And he's going to be yapping?  If there's a God.  Oh, no, no, no.  He is going to have to be put in line.  Did Ben and Steve interview him?  Because I heard Ben and Steve had to interview the Ron and Fez intern.  Well, you know, I guess this is a good point to tell everyone that, you know, all our rejects  are going to the Ron and Fez show.  Right.  People we just didn't want.  We didn't want Black Earl.  We didn't want Harry anymore.  I'm sure we interviewed Paul to intern on our program, right? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, we interviewed the two of them.  Oh, wait.  Oh, it's all better.  Whoa.  There he goes.  Look out.  Look out.  Here he goes.  Oh, Steve.  Oh, here he goes.  All right, set it down.  Set it down.  Wow.  Oh, it's very nice.  It works.  Yes, it certainly does.  Got it back on Saturday.  Where's my hybrid song? 
[00:32:30]  Because now I've got to play it.  I love it.  You were tooling around.  I certainly was.  It is great.  So now you guys interview Ron and Fez as interns.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, Ben and I had to do a lot of work to help get those guys ramped up just  because, you know, they don't really have the staff that we do.  And interviewing interns was part of it.  And you interviewed Paul.  Yeah, yeah, we did.  He was a little anxious.  And what did you think of him?  Retard.  Yeah.  Perfect for the Ron and Fez show. 
[00:33:00]  Well, it's just when you don't get that many applicants, and I think the semester had already  started on some schools, so a lot of them are past the date at which they could actually  apply for an internship.  So we really had to just grab whatever came in.  You know what I see him as?  He's very...  He's over-eager.  Yeah.  Like he's too...  He's trying too hard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  A lot of these guys are like that.  But, you know, and I think Ronnie and Fez will beat him into shape because they're not  exactly nice to their guys.  Do you warn any of our interns beforehand how they're supposed to deal with the talent? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They get strict instructions.  You are not to, you know, carry a notepad, carry a pen, make sure everything, you know,  that's ordered.  Don't just barge in and start telling us about your day.  No.  Because we don't give a shit.  The word you're looking for, no eye contact.  No eye contact with the talent.  I have to add that one.  First the eyes.  No eye contact with the gifted ones.  Right.  That's all we're asking for here.  They are eager.  You know, they're very eager.  Some of them over-eager like this kid Paul. 
[00:34:00]  I actually recognized him from back in an EW.  I couldn't place him.  I don't really know from where I recognize him, but I do remember him showing up for some  events sometime.  Yeah.  All right.  Perverted justice.  Thank you, Steve.  Awesome.  All right.  You're welcome.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Peace.  Hey, there he goes, Steve, everyone.  Perhaps he's been corrected.  Yep, there it is.  And he's gone.  And here's the hybrid song by Chemistry. 
[00:34:30]  Hybrid song.  I know a big bear.  He talks with good diction.  Hibernates in Toyota with good fuel emissions and great tax deductions.  His habitat's a hybrid.  His paws are on the steering wheel.  He barely fits inside it.  His cave has XM and a keyless entry.  Don't leave the scent in your tent.  His belly is empty.  The only bear.  I know a gastric bypass smarter than the average.  I know a gastric bypass smarter than the average.  Roll up in the hybrid and steal your picnic basket.  The ranger's lunch always makes his belly groan. 
[00:35:00]  The last I seen him, he was speeding around Jellystone.  Getting 40 miles per gallon.  Rolling through the Rockies.  Doing Ramone promos for two dish jockeys.  Steve's a piece of garbage forged for nuts and berries.  Top of the food chain but drives a car for ferries.  Piece of shit.  Stores energy with friction and magnets.  Ramone.  Hybrids are for faggots.  Hybrids are gay.  Steve's the queer.  Plug in your automobile.  You take it in the rear, you homo.  Yo, his car got a kickstand.  Go and buy a new one.  Spend more than six grand. 
[00:35:30]  Hybrids are gay.  Steve's the queer.  If you plug in your automobile, you take it in the rear, you homo.  His car got a kickstand.  Go and buy a new one.  Spend more than six grand.  Hybrids are gay.  Like sun's through the hourglass.  So is the ONA virus.  So, uh, so I discovered this new mouse was just too smart and it wasn't. 
[00:36:00]  Smart?  It wasn't getting caught in the mouse trap that was catching me instead.  And I tried everything and I said it with peanut butter and cheese.  I even did what Anthony said and wet that cheese at night.  Yeah, get it up there so you really got to pull on it.  Still got the cheese out, Anthony.  Yeah.  So, uh, he got the cheese off of there without, uh.  Yeah, I don't know what the hell's going on.  Take a little piece of bread and tie it to the, uh, why not?  Well, that's a good idea, too.  You'll get them.  How about this?  Move.  That's a good idea. 
[00:36:30]  No, it's my new obsession.  It's kind of like fishing.  Every morning I'll wake up and see what I got.  Oh, dude.  Wonderful.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm not even kidding.  So, you know, you get bubonic plague from fishing, too.  So, I got, uh, I went to the next level.  I went to the next level.  I got the glue traps.  Bubonic.  Oh.  Bubonic plague.  Bubonic.  Bubonic?  You could say it both ways, and I'm positive of that, so fuck yous all if you want to.  But B-U-B wouldn't be bubonic. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, of course not.  Bubonic.  What?  B-O-O-B?  Bubonic?  Bubonic.  Bubonic.  Bubonic.  Bubonic.  No, that's Bubonic.  It's pronounced both ways.  It can be pronounced both ways.  Give me a god.  You're right.  One would be correct, and one would be incorrect.  Find me a jury.  Find me a jury.  So.  The correct way?  The incorrect way.  I hear you.  Asshole.  So, I graduated to glue traps.  Anthony.  I'm putting bubonic in the dictionary. 
[00:37:30]  I'm not listening, but the audience is.  How long is they going to get the glue traps off your hands?  You know, we can do like two shows today.  Adam and I will talk, and those guys will talk.  And let the listeners try to figure it all out.  He's doing Kevin Dillon, and I'm just giggling.  But your story with Adam is going back and forth.  Oh, I understand.  That's the beauty of what we do.  Hey, go with Mike.  I want to know about the pronunciation.  He would know.  No, he wouldn't.  How do you say bubonic?  B-U-B-O. 
[00:38:00]  Bubonic.  What?  Bubonic.  It's bubonic, stupid.  All right.  No, it's bubonic.  It's bubonic.  No, it's not.  Look, there are two O's with a long O pronunciation after that.  Motherfucker.  That's wrong.  And you know something?  I was wrong.  You're right.  I was wrong.  It is only pronounced one way.  The way I said it.  Bubonic.  No one says bubonic.  It's bubonic.  Everybody says it.  Well, God damn Webster says bubonic.  It's not really.  But you're saying that wrong.  I'm telling you.  I've read it.  No, you haven't. 
[00:38:30]  You're a lying sack of shit.  Webster is a bag of douche.  Bubonic.  Really?  After you have a few beers, do you poop in the toilet?  Well, it's pertaining to a bubo or buboes, which are the stores on you, where the word  bubo came from, by the way.  Bubo.  So it's bubonic, not buboes.  It's spelled B-U-B, though.  Yes, it is spelled B-U-B.  But unfortunately, it's pronounced bubonic.  Okay.  No.  No. 
[00:39:00]  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Well, according to that, it should be fuck Aristotle.  Go fuck yourself.  Irby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  All right. 
[00:39:30]  It looks like the phones are working.  Yes.  Hey, what's going on?  Let's say hi to No Filter Paul.  What's up, Paul?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  What's up?  Hi.  Great party on Friday.  So weird having every black guy in a place wanting a photo with you.  Very, very weird.  Curse of the Bambino took a picture of my wife blowing him, and someone in Wagbag photoshopped 
[00:40:00]  a huge cock in her mouth.  And?  Oh, sorry.  I thought you were gone.  I thought you were gone.  Anyway, yeah, so, uh, and then some ava-ass or, uh, photoshopped stalker paddy getting blowing  me.  So, great.  Wonderful.  That's it, really.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  I thought you were gone.  Did you enjoy the party? 
[00:40:30]  It was great.  Funniest thing is watching Eric drunk.  Hilarious.  What'd he do?  He's just staggering around, telling everyone how they're his friend.  That was it.  Okay!  I don't know.  I give up today.  I feel like Doug at Doug.  Awful phone calls.  Wow.  Now, Doug, uh, does a good phone call.  Yeah.  He had one or two that were bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[00:41:00]  You're not quite, uh, Winston Churchill.  I've got nothing negative to say about the golfers.  What can I tell you?  Very positive.  Oh.  You know, usually just the accent is worth something.  When people with an accent, they could be saying nothing, but as long as it's in that  accent, it's okay.  Wow.  Well, the worst part is you can't hear your show on hold right now, so I have no idea  where the fuck you guys were at when you came to me.  We were actually just talking about Eric and some of the funny things he did when he was 
[00:41:30]  drunk.  We hadn't gotten to anything yet.  We just, like, someone would say, like, yeah, it was kind of tripped out the way he was.  Yeah.  And then you call up and you're like, he's, like, really funny when he was drunk.  So you're like, all right, what's going on with Eric?  Uh, I suck.  No, I'm saying what happened with him, because we were talking about him before.  Oh.  And Paul comes up to me, you know, he goes, hey, Ope, you look depressed.  Yeah.  I was depressed because you were in front of me, Paul.  Oh.  That'll do it.  Never a positive word to say about me on air.  Never a positive word. 
[00:42:00]  Or off air.  Yeah.  Just tell everyone we're best friends off air.  Tell the truth.  Uh, fucking asshole.  Jimmy's going to take care of the problem, trust me.  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy's.  And there's the laugh.  Trumpet.  Thank you, Paul.  Sorry.  All right, later.  All right, there he goes, Paul, with another great phone call.  It won't smell it. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, let's say hi to Del in Brooklyn.  Del, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right, Del.  Hey, listen, yeah, can you break the phones again, man?  This guy's got it.  Yeah.  There it is.  Got the phones working for that?  Yeah, really.  All right.  All right, cool.  So, there you have it.  The pictures from the party are up on opiananthony.com and foundrymusic.com, okay?  Yes.  Our auction is going quite well, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  I got a little update in my email and it seems to be going very well. 
[00:43:00]  Very well.  There's 61 items that are going away today.  What, you mean done?  Yeah, today's the final day for 61 items.  The second phase went up Friday, so those will be up for another, you know, week, I guess,  about seven days.  How's Thans Sign doing?  Thans Sign is doing very, very well, yes.  Oh.  My skates are going for $4,800, Anthony.  Wow.  Nine hours left on that.  Mm-hmm.  As a matter of fact, I used my skates for the last time today.  Last time, that's it.  I have to go and buy new ones now. 
[00:43:30]  But the skates I've been commuting to work here at XM for the last year, also used at  NAW, have done many, many miles on the streets of Manhattan, holding on to, like,  trucks and stuff and tooling around Central Park, they're done.  They're done.  I used them for the last time today.  I will be handing them over to Ben.  The bid is up to $4,800 with nine hours left.  Wow.  Also, Opie and Anthony interned for a day.  That's up to $2,300, pretty much. 
[00:44:00]  I'm rounding these figures off.  Opie and Anthony XM MyFi with lifetime subscription, $1,500, Anthony.  Nice.  That still has seven days left as far as bidding goes.  Opie and Anthony interned for a day, number two.  We gave out two of these.  The second one is up to about $1,300, Anthony, with seven days left on that.  Opie and Anthony assault on the media sign that got Arthur Chien fired.  The one that Nathaniel held up on live TV is going for $810, and that has only six hours 
[00:44:30]  left in the bidding.  Some of the other things, Opie and Anthony, real comedians of O&A, packed number two, $800.  More of the assault on the media sign's autograph, that's up to $760.  And what is the Opie and Anthony Star Wars ROTS digital press kit, Eric?  This is something we got from a press junket.  It's all signed by Samuel L. Jackson.  It comes with a poster and everything.  Ooh.  Hey, that's pretty cool, $660. 
[00:45:00]  And that item's going to go away today as well.  And Opie and Anthony, well, actually, Jim Norton's HBO script, that only has six hours  left as far as bidding for this thing.  It's up to $650.  What is that script of?  That's my, I think, one of my final copies of the actual pilot script that we shot.  Really?  Yeah.  And you could highlight Jimmy's lines and do the acting yourself.  Oh, I don't get this.  I should be going in here.  What time do you think he's coming back? 
[00:45:30]  Dude, I used to always say these dumb scripts.  I had a couple, like, different Chappelle pilots I've auditioned for that never got picked  up.  I wish I would have saved them.  Yeah.  Could have been a big item.  Big item.  Well, when this HBO show is a hit, that'll be a great item to have.  The Jim Norton HBO script.  $650 with six hours left.  So that's just a few of the items that are pretty much, most of those items are going  away today.  Most of them.  And we're going to add a lot of stuff today, I believe.  Are we adding the autographed baseballs today, Eric?  From Cal Ripken in the game.  We have the Cal Ripken one.  The other ones haven't come up yet, but there's a big package coming from D.C., including the 
[00:46:00]  records from Lee Abrams.  How happy were you to see the baseballs make their first appearance at a signing with Ron  and Fez and me, you, Jimmy?  Signing baseballs is such a pain in the ass.  Why are we signing baseballs?  We're DJs.  Because XM has Major League Baseball, I'm sure.  That's why.  So what?  But that doesn't make sense.  You don't have baseball players signing fat chicks in honor of this radio show.  That is true.  It's very hard to sign a baseball. 
[00:46:30]  You know what?  If you have an autographed Opie and Anthony baseball, that's going to be a very rare item  because I'm not signing anymore.  We deny signing them.  Let Ron and Fez sign the baseballs.  And if Don suggests that we sign more baseballs, I'm going to have a new item that we sign,  and it's called the XM Brick.  And I'm going to sign a million of them.  And then on cue, I'm going to tell all our fans to throw them at Don Wicklund.  Yeah.  No more baseballs.  That would hurt.  They're a pain in the ass to sign.  Aren't they hard to sign?  It's so easy to sign a sticker or a picture of a baseball. 
[00:47:00]  I, like most of America, tried to become a Major League Baseball player as I was growing up.  I didn't make it.  I don't want to be signing the stupid baseballs.  Did you want to be a ball player?  Yeah, but I was awful.  Were you?  Yeah, I sucked.  I was the right field guy.  Did you do this in your mitt?  You have to.  The old fist in the mitt?  You have to.  Come on.  Yeah, good point, though, Anthony.  And the baseballs, they're a little smaller, I think, than regular baseballs to begin with.  Are they?  So it's even less room. 
[00:47:30]  Less room.  It's hard.  But you figured it out.  Yeah, I kind of got it down.  You place it on the table and put your hand on the table.  Because I kept looking over to Anthony.  I'm like, how are you doing this?  I can't figure this out.  Oh, yeah.  You know what the best way to do it was?  When Anthony's done with the ball, you take it, and you don't sign it.  You just put it forward.  That was the way I found it to be very effective.  Oh, that's probably an even quicker way.  Yeah, and smudge everyone else's signature.  Let's say hi to Kevin in California.  Kevin, what's going on?  What?  Hey.  What's up, sugar tits? 
[00:48:00]  What's up, Kevin?  Hey.  I was just letting you guys know, doing that bidding on eBay, a lot of them guys do a lot  of sandbagging.  So you've got to watch the last two to three minutes of the auction on a certain item before  it's about to close.  I don't know if you guys will be on air at that time or whatever.  Why?  What are they trying to do?  It'll get crazy at the last minute.  Some people will sandbag, they'll go low, weight low, weight low, and then the last  two minutes they'll jump and bid high.  It'll get crazy at the last minute. 
[00:48:30]  So does that mean we can make more money off these items?  You might.  I'm hoping, because 100% of the proceeds will go to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, so  that would be a great thing.  Way to go, guys.  All right.  Well, a lot of these items going away today.  You can check out all the items up for auction.  There's a link on opiananthony.com.  Thank you, Kevin.  Later, boys.  All right.  Later.  Speaking of Hurricane Katrina, it looks like New Orleans is coming back fast now.  Of course.  Coming back fast.  Of course.  They were saying it's going to be six months before the water's pumped out, and now they're 
[00:49:00]  like, eh, it should be pretty much pumped out by October.  And, oh, my God.  And the body bags are being flown in.  There could be 10,000 dead.  And now they're saying, eh, it ain't going to be that many dead.  The official number is 456.  And they've been looking in a lot of the houses.  For the entire hurricane so far.  They also get a line by asking people who's missing.  You know, things like that.  And they say those estimates were way too high. 
[00:49:30]  And they're not going to be that high.  You know, it's still really bad for a hurricane.  And, by the way, they did not cancel Mardi Gras, just like we said.  Or Anthony said.  Business as usual.  You've got to make the money back.  You know, even if they just spruce up that area.  But what a mess that's going to be.  What about all those areas, though?  Weren't they flooded the French Quarter?  Like, how?  Like, isn't there rots in the store?  Aren't they rotted?  I don't know if it was flooded that bad.  I think their basements were and stuff.  But they pump them out and they fix it.  We walked around down there.  That's what they do.  It's ugly to begin with.  The place stinks anyway. 
[00:50:00]  It's ugly to begin with.  I don't know how much real damage.  Well, I shouldn't say that, I guess.  But I don't know.  They're already sweeping up.  Let's just put it that way.  They're cleaning up.  They have a lot of video of people just starting to clean out their businesses and their homes  and sweeping up around their houses and stuff.  Have you seen the controversy about the Red Cross debit cards that they're handing out?  $2,000 debit cards, right?  $2,000 debit cards.  It's supposed to go out to families.  Households, they say. 
[00:50:30]  It doesn't matter how many people you have in your house.  You only get one card per household.  And they started giving these out at the Astrodome instead of the usual way they did it,  which was to write checks to individuals and hand them the check that they would then have to cash through FEMA.  You know, they would get a check, the Red Cross.  They would get a check and they'd have to cash it.  But since so many people lost their ID, a lot of these people don't have bank accounts,  they decided they were just going to give them these Red Cross debit cards. 
[00:51:00]  They're special, they're white, got the little Red Cross on it, an account number like a regular credit card.  And you got $2,000 on it.  It says not for alcohol, tobacco, or firearms.  Those are the only limitations on these things.  Well, they started handing them out at the Astrodome.  And they had to lock the Astrodome doors and stop handing these things out  because people were just showing up at the Astrodome when they heard this and saying,  where's mine's, you know?  You just kind of walk in and you get $2,000.  You could just walk into the Astrodome? 
[00:51:30]  Apparently some people were, figured it out.  So they stopped doing that.  Well, now these things are turning up in strange places.  A couple of women were found at a Louis Vuitton in Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia,  using these Red Cross cards to buy personalized monogrammed Louis Vuitton handbags that go for,  I don't know, how much do they go for?  $800, $1,000?  Yeah.  A lot of cash. 
[00:52:00]  Wow.  Buying that.  There's been other stories that there's people buying nice suits and things with these Red Cross cards.  And it's not against the law.  Like, they can't deny it in the store, say it's morally wrong.  But they've informed people that they won't be accepting those at Louis Vuitton anymore.  Wouldn't you like to say to somebody, what are you thinking?  Why would you do this?  Oh, look, you're just a silly person.  Why would any silly person waste that kind of money?  I don't understand it.  Here's what they're supposed to do with that $2,000. 
[00:52:30]  You're supposed to use it to get out of whatever shelter or the Ashtonome area.  Texas has said after the 17th, all bets are off.  They're done.  They're done with the refugees after the 17th.  The money they give them is so they can get out, go to either a hotel or something,  and get your own life back in order because we're done with you.  In a week?  That's what they said.  By the 17th, that's it.  So they hand out this $2,000, and that's supposed to be to get yourself a place to stay while you figure out other arrangements. 
[00:53:00]  It's not a permanent fix.  Obviously, $2,000 is not going to get you a house for any length of time or a hotel room.  But that's pretty much a, look, we're done with you.  Make other arrangements.  And here's a little time to give you time to make those arrangements.  Get a bus to Seattle to see Ant Flo or whatever.  That's pretty much it.  But, no, they're using them to buy things.  Monogram the bag.  Well, you know what that is, too.  You can buy nice items and then sell them and get the cash because I don't think you can take out a cash advance on your Red Cross card. 
[00:53:30]  Okay.  So it instantly gives you cash.  They were also worried that when they're handing these things out that these roving bands of thieves are just going to collect these things up from the weak.  You know?  There's no name on them, so you can just grab these things and use them anywhere you want.  How do they prevent people from taking two or three?  Well, how do they prevent a husband and a wife from not splitting up and each getting one and saying, I don't have any ID? 
[00:54:00]  I'm sure they have some kind of system.  I don't know what their system is, but you would think a lot of these people have no ID anyway.  There's no ID.  Perhaps they had to run through and get some type of ID that was set up there at the Astrodome.  That's what I'm thinking is they gave people.  I think they just, you know, painted a red cross on their shoulders as they gave them a card.  Is that it?  Sent them on their way?  Sent them on their way.  Tattooed them.  Maybe some kind of an invisible ink of some sort.  That would show up under an ultraviolet.  Maybe that's it. 
[00:54:30]  Who knows?  But, you know, when you start giving out $2,000 to impoverished people, there's going to be people in there that want more than two grand.  And there's going to be weaker people that they could take it from.  So now they've gone back to their usual method of names written on checks that have to be cashed through some establishment.  And then you do what you want with it.  Then, yeah, you do what you want with it.  But, you know, obviously you should maybe take care of your kids.  Buy food.  Food, food, food.  Well, 60 Minutes did a whole thing on the hurricane. 
[00:55:00]  It was pretty interesting stuff.  We got some clips.  Yeah.  Oh, is this the guy who got his hand stuck between a rock?  Oh, between a rock and a hard place.  OB!  Well, that's the name of the book.  Cut it off.  Yeah, kind of cute.  All right, so we got 60 Minutes doing their story on New Orleans.  Let's take a listen to some of these clips here.  Too many people died because of...  Okay, this is the mayor.  I'm sorry.  Of course it is.  What's up, the mayor of New Orleans?  Too many people died because of lack of action, lack of coordination, and some goofy laws that basically say there's not a clear distinction of when the federal government stops and when the state government starts. 
[00:55:30]  He's the mayor.  He's the mayor, all right.  He's the guy.  Go-to guy.  He's the guy.  Those goofy laws.  There's some goofy laws.  He's the guy.  Like, 9-11 happened.  And everyone knew, you know, Mayor Giuliani was in charge. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  And then obviously the government, you know, took over and did what they had to do.  But before then, you knew who was in charge.  It was Giuliani walking around and marching down there.  Giuliani didn't have to put up with them goofy laws.  Right.  Like we do down...  And Rudy didn't have a warning coming like they did down there.  I mean, they knew it was coming.  Yeah.  I was having an argument with someone over the weekend.  That warning was like 10 days long.  I remember getting a communique from ELO warning us that this hurricane was coming and that it could destroy New Orleans. 
[00:56:30]  That was at least a week out.  At least a week out.  He's saying this could be the biggest hurricane ever to hit the United States.  It could be a Category 5.  And if that's the case, it will destroy New Orleans.  I was reading these emails close to a week out.  Not to mention exact detailed writings about what happened that were printed a couple of years back in National Geographic. 
[00:57:00]  They had the scenario that happened in New Orleans was spelt out pretty much word for word.  It was amazing.  When you read this thing, it tells of the toxic sewage, water, 18 feet high, the levee breaking, looting.  Like it spelt it out.  Amazing.  They knew that this could happen.  It wasn't something where, well, we didn't know if a hurricane hit that this would happen.  And the mayor is just sitting there going, goofy laws.  When the federal and the states, the goofy law, let me quote from you the goofy law. 
[00:57:30]  Paragraph two.  And the mayor then went on to say that he understood why it happened and he liked it, the people who were in charge of FEMA.  But he just didn't like the goofy laws.  We've got to start over now because I've got to hear the mayor say goofy laws.  Goofy law.  Mayor Giuliani did not say goofy laws once during 9-11.  He said goofy laws.  Well, he has his own problems speaking. 
[00:58:00]  Too many people died because of lack of action, lack of coordination, and some goofy laws that basically say there's not a clear distinction of when the federal government stops and when the state government starts.  And if you have federal, if the federal government takes over, then you're giving up some powers or the governor don't ask the president and the president don't ask the governor. 
[00:58:30]  And it was just BS.  Bureaucracy.  No bull crap.  When people are dying, bureaucracy should be thrown out of the water.  Wow, he does not sound like he...  He sounds dumb.  Bureaucracy should be thrown out of the water.  Thrown out of the water.  Who did he run against?  Yeah, I'd like to see the person that lost.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, they're too busy getting drunk hanging out on those damn Mardi Gras floats.  That guy is horrible. 
[00:59:00]  He must be great during Mardi Gras.  You know, he gets up on a float, probably waves to the crowd.  They love it and everything.  But the second a crisis comes in, oh, lordy.  When the president ain't talking to the governor.  And people were talking.  The goofy law states.  The federal government.  The hell?  Goofy law.  I don't think you want your mayor ever saying just goofy law.  Or laws.  Well, we have more from this fine individual. 
[00:59:30]  I watched a guy jump from the Superdome yesterday.  Just couldn't take it anymore.  We have two police officers that have committed suicide.  They couldn't take it anymore.  This is hell.  And to have this happen in the United States of America, in the state of Louisiana,  and to not have immediate, immediate response, regardless of the laws. 
[01:00:00]  Is that crazy?  Bad?  What?  I think it's...  Yeah, I don't know.  That's where that track just ends.  Well, the mayor then went on to say that this shit was fucked up.  You know what the national response authorities would say?  It's a disaster.  It's hard to get stuff in there.  It's hard to fly the helicopters and the trucks in there.  Man, I don't want to hear any of that.  This is a national disaster on U.S. soil. 
[01:00:30]  And if we can deploy troops around the world, if we can deploy national guards in a confined area,  this is a small city.  It's about 500,000 people.  We're not talking about taking over a country.  We're talking about 500,000 people.  And with all the resources that this state and this country has, it should have gotten done quicker.  You kind of made that point with the...  If it was out, you know, kited down there or something. 
[01:01:00]  But the truth of the matter is, the government isn't there.  They're not going to be there in disasters like this immediately.  It just isn't going to ever happen like that.  Because the government isn't this all-knowing, all-seeing being that takes care of us.  They're there after the disaster.  They fix the roads.  They put the power back on.  They do that.  But during and immediately after the disasters that can happen,  it's pretty much based on your own individual strengths and weaknesses, 
[01:01:30]  who will live, who will die, who will be okay, who won't be okay.  That's just the way it is.  We can't sit here.  We like to think the government's going to swoop in and help us.  But it's just not...  That's not the way it works.  It works like that in the movies.  In real life, you've got to suck it up.  You've got to take care of yourself and your own.  And then when the government comes in, they'll fix everything.  That's it.  You read the article in Daily News about what a mess New Orleans was before. 
[01:02:00]  They were talking about the looting and stuff,  and they were just saying that, look, this was a crime-ridden place.  Oh, yeah.  They had half the murders of New York, I think, a few years ago.  And there's 500,000 there.  There's 8 million here.  Yep.  And they had half the murders.  They have a huge problem down there that just was never really addressed.  Everyone likes to say it's a great place to go to see the culture and everything.  But how about the crime?  How about the fact that during Mardi Gras, we looked down and just watched black people beating up white people.  I walked around the French Quarter during the day when we were down there for Mardi Gras. 
[01:02:30]  I did not feel safe at all.  No.  And this was Mardi Gras.  No.  It just felt like there could be a problem at any moment.  All right.  Let's move on here.  Another quote from the mayor here.  And they don't have a clue what's going on down here.  They flew down here one time, two days after the doggone event was over, with TV cameras, all kind of goddamn, excuse my French, everybody in America. 
[01:03:00]  But I am pissed.  He is pissed.  That was a radio rant.  I'm pissed.  That he had.  Then again, I kind of like to hear a politician speaking honestly.  I don't know if this guy's a complete retard or if I like him.  Yeah.  I think he's rolling on that whole thing that it worked for him when he said, you know, get your asses on a plane and get down here.  And people are like, wow, that's, you know, strong of the mayor to say that.  Talking about Bush or anybody who just come down here.  He said, get your asses on a plane and get down here.  And now he's just the potty mouth mayor.  Listen, motherfucker.  It's Samuel L. Mayor. 
[01:03:30]  He's got a wallet that says Mayor Motherfucker.  It's the one that says Mayor Motherfucker.  All right.  We got something from the Lieutenant General Honor√©, I think is his name.  Yes.  Right.  They're seeing, you know, the starving people and evacuations and the lawlessness and, you know, that's all entertaining.  I'm sorry.  This is another one from the mayor talking about seeking out bodies.  They're seeing, you know, the starving people and evacuations and the lawlessness and, you know, that's all entertaining. 
[01:04:00]  But let me tell you what's getting ready to happen.  We're getting ready to drain this city.  And then we're going to go and search, seek and find missions for dead bodies.  And the body count is going to go up.  And it's going to go up to a tremendous level.  And then everybody's going to start to wonder that more people die because of the storm or because of the lack of response.  And that's going to be the big question. 
[01:04:30]  It's not about the coffee in my cup, mayor.  I won't say the rest of that line.  And they're saying that...  Pulp Fiction.  Great movie.  They're saying that Death Toll is going to be a lot less than they originally thought, right?  Mm-hmm.  That's kind of good news, no?  Yeah.  Well, it depends on who you ask, I guess.  But the majority of the country, I think, would say, yes, it's a good thing.  Well, there's probably a few that would say it's a bad thing. 
[01:05:00]  You know, maybe the mayor should have really been on top of it before the hurricane hit.  Warning the people, telling them maybe they shouldn't go up to the attic.  Or if they do, make sure they have some way of getting through the roof.  Mm-hmm.  You know, because that's where you're going to find a lot of your dead, they're saying.  It's easy to say that, though, before you know people were going to go up into their attic.  I don't know.  You've got to think that's what they were going to do, though.  I don't know.  You've got to think on your feet if you're the mayor of the city.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  Hello?  Hello?  The phones are just answering themselves.  That was interesting.  All of a sudden, it just happened. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Something's a little weird with the phones today.  All right.  Here's the Lieutenant General Honor√© talking about the Superdome.  It took time to get here.  And who, on that first day, knew the levee was going to break?  We are blessed in a way that those people made it to the dome.  The dome was a blessing?  It was a blessing.  What would have been the opposite of the storm?  They all would have drowned.  We would have lost a hell of a lot more people. 
[01:06:00]  A hell of a lot more people would have perished.  The guy makes a great point.  Yeah.  You know, you heard about the nightmare that was the Superdome inside there, but those people would have been just wandering around the streets.  Yeah.  That's another 20,000 people that would have just been walking around.  They would have been a lot more dead than the ones that ended up dying in the Superdome, but they never used a Superdome.  The guy makes a pretty good point there.  Are they awful as the conditions were inside?  You read somewhere they're going to knock it down? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, they said that last week.  It's done.  Oh, jeez.  It's completely done.  It can't be fixed?  No.  No, the damage is too great.  Wow.  Yeah, it can't be fixed.  They're going to demolish that.  And then you got the Saints winning yesterday.  That was a little weird.  I didn't notice because there was 14 seconds left and then Fox just switched off the game.  14 seconds left.  It's a tie game.  Yeah, get Ben in here.  Ben can explain this.  I'm so done with that. 
[01:07:00]  They do it every year.  It's fucking sick.  It's the game you want to watch and they have to go to the 4 o'clock games.  The game is like back and forth.  It's not over.  The last two minutes are the most exciting part of the game and all of a sudden they have  to cut away to the next game.  It drives me nuts.  They've been doing it for years and it's to get the fucking local coverage of the fucking  Giants.  They've got to figure it out.  The NFL has to figure it out.  Start the goddamn 4 o'clock games at 4.30.  Obviously, this is a problem. 
[01:07:30]  It's a problem every year.  You'll be watching a game.  You're in New York but you're a Bills fan or whatever.  So, you get to check out this nice 1 o'clock game.  It's an exciting game.  And then, boom, 4 o'clock they have to move over to the local game.  And I wouldn't even mind as much if they went right to the Giants game for contractual  reasons.  What do they do?  Five minutes of fucking commercials.  Oh, so they're just doing it to get their commercials in.  They have to go to the Giants.  Dude, they jumped out of the Saints game. 
[01:08:00]  Carolina ties it up.  It's 20-20.  The Saints are driving.  Obviously, there's interest because it's New Orleans.  You want to see them pull it out.  Right.  Maybe 17 seconds left.  They go.  And we have to go to the other game now.  And it's five minutes of commercials.  And then they go.  It's contractual.  No, that's the excuse they give.  The commercials weren't contractual.  That's not part of the NFL.  That's part of, we sold this advertising time.  And we have to do it right before the game.  We're not losing this cash.  Right, right.  So don't show the fucking games if you're going to have to make those decisions. 
[01:08:30]  It's such a waste.  You invest in this game.  And then all of a sudden, you're out.  You're out with two minutes left.  Are you kidding me?  And then you're, thank God we have the internet now, I guess, where you can at least find out  who finally wins.  You've got to get one of those football packages on satellite.  That's what they want.  I bet there's a product that loves doing that because they know you're going to want to go  out and get the package after that.  If you're a Saints fan.  Fucking move the start to 430.  End of problem.  Well, how about some less commercials?  How about that?  How about moving the game along with a couple less commercials? 
[01:09:00]  That ain't going to happen.  You see the new thing they added this year?  You can watch eight games at once.  I mean, how could you ever do that on one screen?  They're trying to sell a package.  Is that what they're doing?  They're selling a package that you can have eight games on one screen.  It's just retarded.  That's just for the guy, the sick betting guy.  We're just sitting there with his tickets like, wow, oh, what game?  Boy, can you enlarge each screen or no?  I don't know much about it.  It's an extra additional fee.  But for me, the stupid dish, there's a lot of buildings in New York.  You can't even get the dish.  So I have one friend that has the package.  If you were just watching the game in New York yesterday, everybody got that cut off, 
[01:09:30]  and that was a great ending to the Saints game.  I want to find out who did that, and I want to spit in your face.  Whoever you are, I want to spit in your face.  So the Saints won 23-20.  How about those Jets?  Shut up.  Shut up.  What happened?  They lost?  They got destroyed.  27-7.  The Chiefs, they're a powerhouse, though.  You've got to be.  What happened with the field goal kicker?  His first ever kick as a pro.  His first kick.  Comes in there laughing.  I'm like, oh, a little pressure. 
[01:10:00]  He slips.  Ball goes, you know, five feet and taking over.  The funny thing is, they announced that it was his first, you know, kick in the NFL.  Did people laugh at him?  Of course you got to laugh.  You know his family is watching.  Hey, he's playing with the Jets.  It's his first kicker.  Hey, here he is.  Come in.  Come in.  Come on.  Come on.  Quick, quick.  Here he is.  They're kicking.  He's kicking a field goal.  Bloop.  Three feet.  You know what?  They knew that the kicker was in trouble when you went out and you saw the jersey, and the  last name was Mills. 
[01:10:30]  Jesus.  Hop, hop, hop, hop.  Slip.  Yeah, Chad Pennington looked great.  And the thing is, that seven points shouldn't even be counted.  They got that with 29 seconds.  He was supposed to be like another Tom Brady.  Oops.  Yeah.  Oops.  That ain't working out for us, huh?  Dallas.  I hope he's not like another Mike Brady.  Dallas started terrible, and then they pulled it off.  Yeah, Dallas beat San Diego 28-24.  And our buddy Tyson Walter, did you know this?  I heard he got cut, yeah. 
[01:11:00]  He got cut.  Is he with another team yet?  I don't know.  I finally got a hold of, well, I left a message saying, what the hell happened?  And then he finally left a message with me saying there was a personality conflict with  Parcells, and as soon as he got cut, his phone was ringing like crazy.  And last week, he spent the whole week just flying from city to city to, you know, to jump  on with another team.  And I don't know what happened.  We're trying to get info to see if Tyson Walter has a team this year.  He's a good friend of ours.  He used to play center for the Cowboys.  I love to play for the Giants or Jets just so he was here.  That would be really cool.  Personality conflict with Parcells. 
[01:11:30]  That's never happened.  No.  No, he's an easy guy to work for, from what I hear.  The Bills look good with their throwback uniforms.  Those look great.  22-7 over Houston.  Who else do we care about here?  Fez will be happy because Tampa Bay ended up winning.  Yeah.  Pittsburgh looked great.  34-7.  Giants beat Arizona 42-19.  Monday night game's good tonight, too.  It's Philly and Atlanta, so that's a good game.  Michael Vick against, you know, Philly, so. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  Oh, Atlanta, Philly.  Atlanta, Philly.  It's a great game.  Fucking Jets.  Jesus.  The only thing I wish I could hear, I don't know if you guys know, you know Joe Benigno  on FAN?  Used to do overnights.  He works with Sid.  Yeah, I won't even listen to that.  I just want to hear him alone.  Yeah.  Oh, dude, I would give anything to hear him screaming.  What a fucking hardcore Jets fan he is.  Really?  Yeah, man.  He's one of those sports guys.  He's not just some douchebag reporter, but he's like a hardcore fan.  He would go ballistic.  He was the greatest. 
[01:12:30]  By the way, someone was saying you can enlarge the games if you see one you like.  Oh.  All right.  So let's say hi to Darrell in D.C.  Darrell, what's up?  What's up?  What's up, man?  Hey, I was calling to say you guys are kind of hypocrites on this little issue about the  New Orleans flooding and so forth.  All right.  Why is that, sir?  Because I listened to your show during a World Trade Center bombing and so forth, how sad  you guys were and how down you guys were.  Yeah.  And I don't know if it was because you've seen more people like yourself, which is white, 
[01:13:00]  or you made an issue out of it less of an issue because most of the people that are  dying is black.  That's not...  Let me interrupt you.  I know what you're saying, dude, but no.  Part of it is the coverage is that, first of all, after the World Trade Center bombing,  you didn't have reports of rapes and murders.  It was a different type of a thing.  And it's also, there was a lot of planning for this that should have been...  Now they're playing a blame game.  After 9-11, nobody was playing the blame game.  Because there was an enemy.  Right.  You can't get mad at a hurricane and, you know, try to bring a hurricane to justice. 
[01:13:30]  But no one is thinking, ah, the black people, who cares?  White people, no one is thinking that, dude.  No one.  And I think what also made us a little sensitive to the fact is that I was smelling rotting bodies,  you know, firsthand.  We were a lot closer to the 9-11 thing.  Yeah, a little different.  I'm sure if you're down there in New Orleans, this is going to touch you a little more.  We all knew people that died on 9-11.  You know, this is just how we think as humans.  I mean, the further you are away from a tragedy, it doesn't affect you as much. 
[01:14:00]  I'm sorry.  It just doesn't.  I mean, you know, I was sad by a lot of the images from the hurricane, but 9-11, it was  so much worse for me, personally.  And already you're hearing about people like, you know, and again, after 9-11, you heard  about people trying to capitalize, too.  It just didn't happen as fast.  You know, when there's a hurricane or some earthquake on the other side of the world  that kills 1,000, every once in a while you'll see that in the paper, like 1,000 dead  from an earthquake, you give it, like, maybe 30 seconds, like, oh, well, let's see what  the Jets did last night. 
[01:14:30]  Oops.  Because you're so far away from the actual tragedy.  It's just the reality of those things.  So, dude, how come you don't think we're handling it right?  Because we were screaming about how horribly the government was responding, and we're doing  stuff to try to raise money for the people.  I'm not sure what you're saying.  Right, but you're making fun of the mayor.  The mayor of New Orleans is right.  Dude, he sounds like an idiot.  Dude, come on.  Those quotes are awful.  He's not being politically correct with some of the things he's saying.  No, it's not PC.  Go ahead.  Yeah, but once a state of emergency is declared, the government of FEMA takes over, and they 
[01:15:00]  move in and mobilize troops and things like that within those areas, like they do in Florida.  You're probably right.  If you know within Florida, I mean, I work with some of those guys, and we actually went  down to Florida during their hurricane, and we get a 24-hour notice and a plane ticket  before the time.  So, during this, they were denying people and nurses to go down there because they haven't  received the proper authority to go. 
[01:15:30]  FEMA was atrocious.  We smashed FEMA, and the only reason we're making fun of the mayor is because of his quotes.  He said those goofy laws.  He's not coming off sounding like a guy who should be leading you post-tragedy.  Yeah, Giuliani was quoting Churchill during 9-11, and this guy's going, those goofy  laws.  I mean, come on.  That's bull crap.  Huh?  10-city square block.  This is the entire city.  Yeah, but you have to...  And the reason why the body count is going to be so low is because most of those bodies  are washed out to sea.  You think?  They're washed out. 
[01:16:00]  Maybe some of them.  All right, maybe some of them.  I don't know about that.  They'll still get an accurate body count.  They don't need...  They have a body count in the World Trade Center.  A body count means total dead.  It doesn't mean physical bodies.  So, they'll get the body count.  I mean, the World Trade Center didn't recover a lot of the bodies, and they still know how many  people died, it's just a figure of speech.  Yeah, and most of the bodies are going to be found in the houses, because people at least  got off the streets at the last minute.  I mean, there's some that didn't make it.  You're right, but the majority of bodies are going to be found in buildings.  But most of the people that stayed there were either homeless or very poor. 
[01:16:30]  So, homeless people, I'm pretty sure nobody's going to know where...  They have no family...  Well, they have family, but nobody knows where they are.  Some.  Do we really care about the homeless?  Just a question today.  Obviously not.  Just a question.  Not a statement.  Do we really care?  Seriously.  I see them in New York all the time, and people are just bothered by them.  They don't feel sorry anymore.  They're just bothered.  Like, ugh, why are you in my way?  Why?  I'm just pointing out some facts, man. 
[01:17:00]  I mean, like...  We all like to think we're do-gooders, and we have a heart.  But the reality is, I see it in New York all the time.  These people are just in the way.  But the facts are, we smashed FEMA.  We felt...  We definitely were furious at the way the government was responding in New Orleans.  We're just talking about the way the mayor is being quoted, and the things he's saying.  Look, let's be honest.  They don't sound particularly mayoral.  Right, but I can understand why he's doing it, because it's frustrating.  Hey, a big quote from the president just hit the TV. 
[01:17:30]  I swear, it's a real quote.  It says, Bush wants to find out what went right and what went wrong.  That's his quote this morning.  Yeah, that's just what he does.  But, I mean, like I said, we work with...  My company works with the government with disasters and setting up communications back to those areas.  Yeah.  Anytime there's an event in Florida, it's automatically done.  It's a done deal.  Or any major city or any city, when they declare a state of emergency, we're always there. 
[01:18:00]  But, just so happened on this case, there happened to be a lot of black people there that nothing happened.  I think it's more an impoverished thing than a black thing.  It just so happens that most of the impoverished down there are black.  I mean, it's a poor area.  The help is going to go into poor areas a lot slower than it is in a wealthy area.  That's just the way this country works.  Right.  If it happened in Kentucky, where there's a poor white area, help wouldn't be slow. 
[01:18:30]  It happened in Mississippi and Alabama.  I think it would be slow.  It would definitely be slow.  The resources just aren't there.  It's a poor area.  In Mississippi and Alabama, the resources wasn't slow.  We had 10 guys that went out there for Mississippi, and they went there before they went to New Orleans.  I think they were three days late, the government, two and a half to three days late.  You've got to give them a day or two to get things down there.  I don't think anybody realized it would be as bad as it was. 
[01:19:00]  And local government down there was atrocious.  I'm sorry, the mayor and the governor did not handle things as well as they should have,  and the federal government didn't either.  But you can't just throw it all on the federal government.  Like I was originally saying, it was all Bush.  But then the more you hear about the things they could have done,  the more you realize, all right, they dropped the ball too.  Right, but once they issue a state of emergency, the government issues that,  the state government doesn't have any control over that anymore.  The government takes over.  That's why they issue that.  Well, they were atrocious too. 
[01:19:30]  They set it up.  That's what I'm saying, 24 hours before.  All right.  So that's what I'm saying.  They didn't set up any buses.  They knew that the state itself didn't have enough buses to bus these people out,  that there were going to be people left.  And they sent no one.  They didn't mobilize any helicopters within the area at certain Air Force bases,  like what they do within Florida when national disasters hit the air.  All right, Darrell.  You made your points today.  Thank you.  Bye, Darrell.  All right, thank you.  There he goes, Darrell from D.C. 
[01:20:00]  Adam in New York, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say that I live in the upstate New York,  like towards Binghamton area.  Yeah, they didn't take off the Saints game.  So I don't know, maybe it was just like Metro New York or whatever.  Well, it happens in every big city, though.  They're knocking off the 1 o'clock game for the 4 o'clock game.  I think a lot of people could relate to what we said.  It's a pain in the ass.  I mean, it was a hell of an ending, though.  I saw it live, and I was like, hell yeah, man.  All right.  For the Saints, definitely.  But also, everybody rejects because they definitely suck ass.  Thanks, Adam.  Yeah, the Cowboys rule day one. 
[01:20:30]  That's my team.  They kick their ass.  Good point, sir.  All right, let's get back to this from 60 Minutes.  Floodwall expert talking about the New Orleans situation.  We learned something that surprised us here.  Despite what you've been hearing, not one of New Orleans levees failed.  All of the massive earthen levees survived.  The failure was in floodwalls like this one on the 17th Street Canal.  The floodwalls are miles long, but only two feet thick.  The walls were designed in 1965 to... 
[01:21:00]  Two feet thick?  Yeah.  It's that feet.  I thought it was the levees that broke.  Everyone thought that.  I did, too.  Yeah.  It was just these floodwalls that weren't as strong as the levees.  When the levees went over, they went over the levees, right?  They kind of flooded over the levees?  No, I think it was just the wall breaking.  They have these canals that come out of the lake that kind of...  Do you ever do that when you're a little kid to a little puddle,  and you make a little river coming off the puddle in the mud? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, when you're a little kid.  It's pretty much the same thing.  They just kind of pulled water from the lake down this river, almost, a little canal,  and then put walls on either side of it to keep it from overflowing when the lake gets full.  But that's what broke those cement walls and flooded in, as we all know.  All right, let's continue.  Signed in 1965 to withstand a Category 3 storm, Category 4 Katrina pushed her surge over the top. 
[01:22:00]  What could have been done before now to prevent this from happening?  I don't know.  I don't think...  You know this better than anyone.  Well, yeah, but you see, that was not sufficient money or time to do anything about this.  It's somebody that said, okay, here's a billion dollars.  Stop this failure from happening for Category 4.  It couldn't have been done in time.  I'd have had to start 20 years ago. 
[01:22:30]  To where I feel today, I would have been safe from a Category 4 storm like Hurricane Katrina.  Shouldn't this have been done 20 years ago?  Sure.  It should have been done 20 years ago.  But, you know, what can we do about that?  You have to recognize before we had Category 3 protection, we didn't have anything.  Are we really shocked that that's going on in America?  No.  You know how many bridges you drive over every day are ready to crumble at any moment?  Yeah.  Seriously.  And they know that.  They know.  They're not going to all of a sudden start a project to fix every single bridge in America. 
[01:23:00]  What happens is what happened in, like, Connecticut a few years back.  All of a sudden, it just falls down.  Falls down and oops.  Oops, few people died, you know.  And then they go around and maybe if one's really bad, they might work on that one for a while.  And then they fix a few that they really know are in deep trouble just to make it look good.  And that's that.  There's bridges falling down, you know, every year in America.  There's so many structures around America that are ready to just go.  Yep. 
[01:23:30]  60 Minutes asking the question like they're surprised that this wasn't taken care of.  Of course they knew.  But it was going to be too expensive to all of a sudden, you know, get it all set for a Category 4 or 5.  Stuff just breaks over time.  That's what happens.  And they know it's going to break.  And it's figured into the whole damn thing.  Yeah.  Because as Americans, they don't care about us as individuals.  We're all, it's just stats.  It's the masses.  The country.  It's just stats.  Americans.  Well, we could fix every single bridge in America by the year 2020, right? 
[01:24:00]  Or we'll fix them from time to time.  And we have figured maybe, I don't know, a couple hundred people will die between now and 2020.  Figured in.  It works.  That's what they do.  There's no surprise there.  Of course.  Now that, now it'll be fixed because now they have to.  Now they're going to have to put some kind of huge walls up.  Oh, you look at, you watch the wall they build now.  That'll be giant 15 feet thick.  Oh, of course.  All right, we're back to the mayor here.  Can you believe, can I just jump in here? 
[01:24:30]  Maybe I'm wrong that you get annoyed at this.  In the daily news, there's a picture of the two towers, the two light towers where the Trade Center were, like where they do every 9-11.  Yes.  And underneath it, it says Con Edison.  Like, is that a fucking ad?  That's an ad, yes.  Is fucking Con Ed using the towers of light that where the Trade Center were as an ad for your fucking, is that what they're doing?  That's exactly what they're doing.  Is that an ad, yeah?  Or is it a, you know, we're with you as New York and. . . 
[01:25:00]  Well, I think that'd be one of the same.  If you're putting your logo, if you need to put your logo beneath what you've done, it's an ad.  I mean, you're drawing attention to, yeah.  The fact that you did it.  Yeah, that you're Con Edison.  Yeah.  Of course.  Look at that.  They're trying to do it tastefully.  Do you think they give them the power for that for free?  Yeah, that's why they're doing it.  Exactly.  That's why they're doing it.  Yeah, so as a trade-off, they get a little ad.  Yeah, get an ad.  That's nice. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, that is a little much.  Time is weird, too, man, because the coverage on 9-11 was so much less this year than last year.  Oh, every year it'll just be less than less.  Every year it just dwindles a little more.  I didn't realize it was even the 10th.  Like, I didn't realize, oh, shit, yeah, until somebody said it.  It was like, you're just starting to fall back into regular life.  Yeah.  I remember the first anniversary, it was all over.  I was watching all the coverage and everything.  And now, you know, obviously, I'm not forgetting, that's for sure.  But just enough, I can't hear any more about it. 
[01:26:00]  I know everything about it.  Here's another question, though.  Do you think the president should have been there?  Probably, yeah.  I think he should be there every year as long as he's in office.  Where was he?  Especially the guy that was in office when it happened.  Maybe when there's a new president there, maybe that'll be a little different.  But I think Bush should be there every year.  He wasn't there, huh?  Wow.  I don't think so, right?  Because they go to World War II stuff and they go to Vietnam, which they should do.  Bush was in office, obviously, when it happened. 
[01:26:30]  And I think he should be there every year until he's out of office.  Simple as that.  Just mark your calendar.  You're going to New York every year on 9-11.  Where was he?  Where was he?  What a disaster president he is.  God, he's had 9-11 and this big hurricane thing.  The war.  Just a whole bad vibe about his presidency.  It's just been bad right from the start. 
[01:27:00]  It will be refreshing to get someone new in there that's just like, enough of this shit  that's happened since he's been in.  And I'm not blaming or anything.  I'm just saying, you know, it's just a bad buzz he's got.  Yeah, let's just start a new.  Just start new.  Can the Democrats please just put one guy out that isn't a complete liberal on crime  or taxes and I'll vote for him.  Please, just one guy who's kind of okay with taxes and doesn't want to rape you for half  your cash.  We got Hillary, so that should be good.  That's true, and she's a guy. 
[01:27:30]  All right, here we go.  Another quote from the mayor of New Orleans.  You know, I was reading the paper, going back to the 9-11 thing.  You know that 74% of New Yorkers voted for Kerry?  Yeah.  Or against Bush, I guess I would say.  I know New York is a democratic state.  I was amazed that it was that high, though.  Oh, yeah.  A bunch of liberals here in New York.  94% voted against Bush in the last election.  It's a miracle that Giuliani won twice, and then Bloomberg, who is an ex-Democrat, but 
[01:28:00]  he's still under the Republican.  Right.  Bloomberg's going to win again.  Yeah, he hasn't done anything.  Who the hell's running against him?  On a personal level, on a couple of things with Bloomberg, you're like, eh, what an ass.  But, again, like Giuliani, he's just kind of made the city better during his time in  there.  Like Giuliani, everyone hated him, man.  And it was just, but when he took office to the time he left, the difference between  New York City was amazing.  Amazing.  There's a mayoral candidate, by the way, who does all this weird stuff. 
[01:28:30]  Bernie Getz?  Yeah.  Not Bernie, but one of the guys Bernie mentioned.  What about his candidacy?  Yeah, they don't mention that.  This guy here, you've seen his face.  The guy who has the two little hair things here.  Right.  Christopher Brodor.  He's like a real, like one of these alternative guys, man.  Man.  Yeah, and he's actually dating Jessica, who came in here and played guitar back when we  came on.  Okay, yeah, yeah, sure.  So, if we want to get him on, we probably could.  Yeah, yeah, they've been together for a while.  Has he been to any of the debates?  Oh, he goes, he disrupts them. 
[01:29:00]  I don't know the guy.  I met him once.  You know, we chatted very briefly.  But I'm sure we'd be able to get him in.  And he has a mayoral candidate.  There's a thing in the post about him.  All right.  Odd guy.  We have just three more sound clips here.  60 Minutes did a whole thing on the New Orleans situation.  Here's the mayor again.  Consider being in my shoes.  What would you have done?  And if I said anything disrespectful to the office of the president or governor, I apologize. 
[01:29:30]  But tell me what we're going to do now.  And what did the president say?  The president basically said, Mr. Mayor, I know we could have done a better job, and we're  going to fix it.  The president acknowledged to you that it wasn't handled in the best way?  Well, he said they could have done better.  Uh, duh.  Here's, uh, the lieutenant general again.  Now, think about this.  Every house that's flooded right now, we have to go in and see if there's anybody in it. 
[01:30:00]  And, God forbid, take those who didn't make it.  Every building, every room.  What are you going to find, sir?  Uh, I think we're going to find a lot of people.  Stupid.  What are you going to find, sir?  What do you think you're going to find, you ass?  That's nothing.  That's Stone Phillips, right?  I don't know.  That's 60 Minutes?  Yeah, it was 60 Minutes.  I saw that last night.  I thought they, are you sure?  That doesn't sound like anything I heard on 60 Minutes. 
[01:30:30]  Maybe they got it wrong.  Maybe it was, uh, they're all the same program.  I don't know.  No, no, because I, I.  20, 60, 48 hours.  They did a great thing.  Ed Bradley did a story last night on the, uh.  Yeah, it doesn't sound like the old curmudgeons that you're used to hearing on 60 Minutes.  And they had, the guy who they focused on were the cops, and, uh, the guy who was the  police lieutenant, uh, or the police chief, was great.  Really?  Just calling the cops that left cowards, and oh, man, was he smashing the guys that walked  off the job.  It was great.  Wow.  Yeah, they had a high desertion rate, and then the cops looting in the stores, and I 
[01:31:00]  saw that one.  Oof.  I don't blame the cops for walking off the job.  Why is that?  Because they had to worry about their own asses.  I know, but when you.  They didn't have houses to go to.  When you take that oath.  And they had to worry about their families.  You're taking that oath.  You have to fulfill your duty.  It's more than just a paying job.  I understand that, but.  It's not like you work at the deli counter.  I don't blame them.  You said a few times that, you know, every man for themselves has got to take care of  your own and your family and stuff.  You know, you want these cops going down to the French Quarter or where have you when 
[01:31:30]  they don't even know if their own families are safe?  Fuck that, man.  When you take that job.  It's like the people that join the army to go to school, you know?  And then they are upset and worried and everything else when a war kicks up.  Sorry.  It's not like you just signed on for a student loan.  But the reality is they're going to desert.  They're just going to.  But you're not supposed to.  I get that.  And it's not just like the average Joe. 
[01:32:00]  This is a laugh question, but you're a cop down in New Orleans.  You have a family.  Yeah.  Two things that would never happen.  Right.  And all of a sudden this hurricane hits.  You're staying on the job?  I wouldn't.  Wouldn't you at least make sure your family's okay?  Get them to an aunt's house or get them out of the area and then maybe go back on the  job?  You know what?  You're showing up to work knowing that your family's still officially not safe.  When you take these jobs, you have to realize that that's part of what might happen.  And that should be part of your decision to take those jobs. 
[01:32:30]  And that's why I would never take that job.  I'm a every man for himself guy.  Oh, man.  Aunt would just run over kids if you had to.  When I get in that big gas guzzler of his and just plow people down and get out of that area.  When I get on a plane and I look at the exits on the plane, I'm not looking at which way  I have to go.  You know how they talk about the aisles will be lighted and you step out and get this aisle.  I look at as the crow flies from where I am to the door and who I'm going to have to run 
[01:33:00]  over the top of, over the seats to get to that exit.  And I will look at women, elderly and children and plot out my route over their fucking heads  to get off of the plane.  Here's how you sum it up.  I agree with the police chief.  I would have behaved like the deserting officers.  Yeah, I know.  We didn't even know.  He's right.  And yes, I would have done exactly what they did. 
[01:33:30]  The same thing.  Oh, no.  What?  Is something funny over there?  Jesus.  Yes, Jimmy.  This can only mean one thing.  Jimmy's gotten to the comics, Anthony.  Oh, look at that.  Jimmy has made it to the comics.  Dude, I know it's a serious discussion.  I got to explain to people.  We start the show, Jimmy starts reading the newspaper.  He did the Con Edison thing a little while ago and he finally got to the middle of the  paper and I guess you've seen a few comics you like. 
[01:34:00]  It sounds like a couple or a real hoot.  This one here, it's Marmaduke and he's walking in and he looks like he's been drinking or whatever  and the guy who's opening the door goes, I suppose you'll be sleeping in late tomorrow  a morning, well, I have to get up for work. 
[01:34:30]  Marmaduke's been drinking or something.  What does that mean?  And, dude, they did not do this.  These longhorns.  He's sitting there, right, and the look on his face, you've got to see it.  Wait, what paper are you in?  I've got to play a lot.  The Daily News.  All right.  The Daily News.  Page 47.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Fan passed out laughing hats. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm losing my breath.  All right, go ahead.  Page 47, the Lockhorns.  He's sitting there in a chair and he's looking at her and she's walking away.  She ain't even looking at him.  And on her shirt, it says 913.  And he goes, you're determined I won't.  We start over here.  You're laughing.  He goes, you're determined I won't forget her anniversary this year, aren't you?  She's got the date on her shirt. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, I'm absolutely crying.  Always hysterical.  Oh, my God.  I can't read these when we're not on break.  Wow.  Well, keep reading the comics, Jimmy, because someone has a problem with me here.  It's Andrew.  Oh, no.  Go ahead, Andrew.  Hey, L.D., I got a comment. 
[01:36:00]  I was a former NIPD.  I'm a cop down in Miami.  And you don't walk off the job.  You don't.  I mean, we've got hurricanes down here.  Look at the guys at 9-11.  What would happen if they walked off the job?  Right.  Take care of their family.  They walked in there.  I'm not saying it.  Hold on, hold on, Andrew.  I'm serious.  I'm not saying it's okay to walk off the job, but I can see why they would.  Obviously, you'd want the cops not to walk off the job.  Of course.  I get that.  It's never happened.  It's never happened. 
[01:36:30]  I'm not sitting there going, hey, way to go, guys.  Way to walk off the job.  But I can see why they, you know, their thought process that they're thinking, I've got to  take care of my family first.  I tell you, every single cop in America is disgusted with those guys because it's the  same oath.  It doesn't matter if you're in a city in Iowa or a big city in New York.  It's the same oath.  You take that job, you know what's going to happen if something, especially in the  Orleans when they know that something like this could happen.  Down in Miami, we know hurricanes that are going to happen. 
[01:37:00]  I mean, of course, it didn't know where near the Orleans, but 10 people died from this  hurricane in Miami.  Some of those families could have been cops.  You never hear earthquakes in California, the Oklahoma City bombing, the NYPD with 9-11.  You never hear it.  They lost a third of their police force.  One third of their police force just walked off the job.  I mean, it's insane.  It just does not happen.  It does not happen.  Maybe a few guys will walk off or check their phone, but they're back.  They should have came back. 
[01:37:30]  They haven't even come back.  This has been close to a month now.  Right.  It's insane.  Insane.  Okay.  Good job, Andrew.  Thank you.  Take care, buddy.  All right.  Ian M. from Toronto is trying to call me out.  The aisles will be lighted on fire.  Lighted?  I think you mean lit.  I thought lit, too, but I think Anthony is right.  It is correct to use ether.  I believe so.  You can use ether.  Wait, what was that about?  The aisle pass will be lighted.  The lights on the aisle will be, yeah, lighted.  That is actually a word.  I always said lit. 
[01:38:00]  Use it like that.  I don't really know much.  Jack off.  Toronto figures.  Oh, oh, oh, Jimmy.  Wait, not another one.  How much joy can be in one paper?  Oh, but dude, whoever writes Beetle Bailey is this guy.  Oh, well.  Enough said.  The old Sarge is looking at Beetle, and Beetle's doing something.  I think it's with a grenade.  He's trying to unscrew it.  So the Sarge goes, they're in a hole.  Uh-huh.  And the other Sarge looks at Beetle, and Beetle's got his tongue out, you know, his helmet's 
[01:38:30]  on.  He's trying to unscrew this thing.  And the other Sarge goes, just push down and twist.  And in the next frame, it's more than one frame.  Two frames.  Oh.  Beetle has thrown the grenade, and Beetle's going, when did they start putting childproof  jabs on hand grenades? 
[01:39:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Funny, funny stuff.  Oh, that's wonderful.  And you get this on a daily basis.  It's amazing that they could come up with stuff like that every day.  All for 50 cents.  A little news, a little sports in the comics, Anthony.  There shouldn't be one person out there depressed.  There you go.  One more clip from the mayor as Jimmy looks through the comics here, talking about the  death toll in New Orleans.  We're all over the ball field today. 
[01:39:30]  We think we evacuated 80% of the people in the city as it relates to this particular event.  Do the math.  That's 100,000 left.  We've evacuated 35,000 people so far.  Let's say there's another 15,000.  There's 50,000 people unaccounted for.  But which number do you want to pick?  5%?  10%?  15%?  I don't know.  But I think it's going to be significant. 
[01:40:00]  That's some fucked up repugnant shit.  Well, they seem to be pulling it together now.  It's going to be a lot lower than the 10,000 they originally pulled.  Yeah.  It's still, you know, obviously a tragedy.  Anthony, okay, so we're going to move on here.  The Hurricane Katrina thing, we've got our auction going on, okay?  You go to opianthony.com.  The link is there.  There are a bunch of items that are ending within the hour, Anthony.  Uh-oh. 
[01:40:30]  Final bid's coming in for the Opie and Anthony Dick Cavett Show Rock Icons DVD autographed  by Dick Cavett.  If you want to bid on that, you only have like 19 minutes left.  There's a couple of those.  There's some WWE stuff autographed by John Cena and Chris Jericho and Triple H.  All that's going away within the hour.  So if you want to make some final bids on those items, go to opianthony.com and click  on the link.  All the proceeds will go to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Wow, really?  The auction is just shy of $32,000 so far. 
[01:41:00]  And we're going to add more items today and the rest of the week.  Yes, Jimmy.  Can I ask an honest question?  Is there anybody that actually just laughs through all these?  That actually reads it and laughs?  I have to ask what this means.  All right.  This is called For Better or Worse.  Uh-huh.  And it's two women hugging.  It's a daughter and her mom.  Daughter's an adult, the mom's an adult.  Okay, it's hot already.  Of course it is.  Getting hotter.  And they're standing by a car.  There's luggage. 
[01:41:30]  Obviously, one of them's getting ready to leave.  Thanks for everything, Mom.  We've had a great visit.  And then the daughter says,  You sure you'll be okay driving all the way home alone?  And the mom says,  I'm sure.  And the mom says,  I have food, water, a full tank of gas.  And the daughter says,  What about music?  I'll get some...  Let me act it out.  What about music?  I'll get you some music.  And then the daughter says,  Here, I guarantee these will keep you awake.  She's handing the mom some CDs.  Uh-huh.  So now the last frame is the mom's driving. 
[01:42:00]  And out of the speakers, you hear,  Phump, bumpa, thud, biat, bump.  And then click.  And then the mom says,  But only if I listen to them.  Right.  Yeah.  Let's see if she can tolerate the music.  She can't take the music.  Would have kept her awake.  Phump, bumpa, thud, biat, boom.  I love that song.  That's fantastic.  Phump, bumpa. 
[01:42:30]  Phump.  It's got to be the latest from Sheryl Crow, I'm thinking.  It was probably rap.  Nothing.  And mom couldn't take it.  Right.  I probably should have went with,  I don't know, maybe someone even mellow her.  Well, no, Sheryl Crow has a great song called,  Dating a Guy with One Ball Was My Greatest Mistake.  All right.  Phump, thumpa.  Phump.  Hey, Bob Kelly's here.  He's got an item for the auction.  Oh.  We'll talk to him next.  Ooh.  And our buddy, another buddy, Stephen Lynch, has a new CD out called The Craig Machine. 
[01:43:00]  Aha.  He hasn't been around.  He's touring, right?  No, he took the summer off.  It's too early, is what it is.  This show is too early.  He's coming in soon.  But he took the summer off and just mellowed out for the first time.  And now he's going to do his college tour again, right?  He really is a drunk.  He took the whole summer off.  He's been with his wife.  Lush.  Stephen Lynch is a drunkard.  He's going to be, the week of our anniversary, he's going to be in New York.  He's playing a town hall.  And he's going to be in.  Cool.  Ben knows every event that's going on. 
[01:43:30]  I have a question.  I read something on Wackbag.  Now I could be wrong.  Are you guys doing the first anniversary on the Halloween party separately or together?  No, together.  Oh, it is together.  Yeah.  31st at the Hard Rock.  I'll suck your cock right now.  Thank you, Tom.  Wow.  Let's go.  I think I'll be here.  We were trying to come up with a concept for our first anniversary.  Do you want to suck a guy's cock?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  And the actual anniversary is too close to Halloween.  And we want to do this Halloween thing.  It was a concept that I thought of years ago. 
[01:44:00]  And we're finally going to do it.  Halloween party.  But you've got to show up to the party with a costume that has something to do with the  Opinion Anthony show.  Something to do with the show.  So the costumes will be a lot different than any other party you would go to.  It doesn't mean someone from the show, although it could be.  But it could be anything.  I'm hoping to see somebody dressed like Grady from The Shining.  Wow.  See, that would be something that has something to do with the show.  It's going to be awesome.  Because there's going to be a lot of inside stuff.  Right.  Connor Peterson.  Yeah, a little Connor.  Some of the costumes you're going to be walking around going, you're not going to get 
[01:44:30]  it at first.  Yeah, you've got to figure it out.  And then you're going to be dying.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  And we're going to have cash prizes for the best costumes and stuff.  And some of them are just going to be mean.  Like, you're going to hear what's going to happen.  Some guy is going to walk in with a white t-shirt with five circles on it and a glub glub  written underneath it.  And you know what?  I'm going to howl.  I'm going to get it.  And I'm going to howl.  So October 4th is our first anniversary at XM.  So that day we'll go, hey, wow, look at us.  And I'll call in.  And Jimmy will call in from L.A. 
[01:45:00]  We'll talk.  And we'll say, wow, that was a wild year.  Woof.  Hey, here's some audio from our first show.  I don't know.  Ooh.  But then we'll have the real celebration on Halloween.  We'll blow it out big time.  I need a costume.  Yes, you do.  By the way, Halloween, October 31st, my birthday.  Oh, happy birthday.  Not yet.  Ugh.  Not yet.  Jesus.  You are an ass.  So Stephen Lynch, he didn't know.  Good friend of the show, has a new CD out called The Craig Machine. 
[01:45:30]  Why don't we try a track here called Baby?  For my little girl.  For my little girl.  My lady gives birth today.  I run to her room right away.  She smiles with glee and hands her to me. 
[01:46:00]  I look at my newborn and say,  Damn, that's so ugly, baby.  Damn, that's an ugly ass, baby.  I'm feeling quite concerned.  My semen must have turned.  Cause damn, that's an ugly ass, baby.  I can't believe this came from me. 
[01:46:30]  I think her mom did too much LSD.  She's skinny like a twig.  At least her nuts are big.  But the placenta is cuter than she is.  Damn, that's an ugly baby.  Goddamn, that's an ugly ass, baby.  I can't take her home today.  She'll scare the dog away.  Cause damn, that's an ugly baby. 
[01:47:00]  And when she smiles, I find Shane McGowan comes to mind.  It makes me want to cry when I look into her good eye.  I always wanted kids.  Is it wrong to hope for sis? 
[01:47:30]  Fuck you, it's my fucking baby!  Then the doctor calls me in.  Mr. Litch, she has a twin.  Damn, that's a good-looking baby.  One for two on the good-looking babies.  I almost start to weep.  Now this one we can keep.  Cause that was an ugly ass. 
[01:48:00]  Damn, that's an ugly baby.  Come on, everybody, sing along.  Damn, that's an ugly baby.  Sing, fuckers, come on!  Damn, that's an ugly baby.  Woo!  Damn, that's an ugly baby.  She's got one good tooth and one ear and one eye.  And thank God, just one nose, but it's on her left thigh.  Now, doctor, I'm asking you guy to guy.  But a really, really, really late term abortion still fly. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, no!  My baby!  Not me!  I don't want no ugly baby.  I said, damn, that's an ugly baby.  Damn, that's an ugly ass baby.  In a fancy world.  Sorry for all the background noise.  I just opened a box.  I got another gift.  Where status is everything. 
[01:49:00]  Thanks, Andy, from Seattle.  He sent me a used drill.  One man.  I'm an entertainer.  A fancy man.  Do you understand?  There's a fancy entertainer talking.  We'll begin a quest for the ultimate gift.  Fuck you.  The drill diva.  Anybody have anything lighter?  Like maybe a fucking bowling ball with two ledge shoes?  When a regular gift is out of reach.  How about just some pictures of vaginas and some pornography?  Right.  And the gift he gets is unacceptable.  For your deeds, you should have a cordless drill in your mouth. 
[01:49:30]  Well, come on, what do you want?  I want a new drill.  Dude, you don't appreciate shit.  I want a cordless fancy drill, boy.  The drill diva took my breath away, says Eric Nagel.  Think about how I feel.  Hoping I have a new cordless gift and seeing that cumbersome cord.  And Ben from Boston raves.  Wah ha ha ha.  Dude, dude.  You want me, me, plugging a cord in like you have to?  You've never seen a spoiled brat hissy fit like this. 
[01:50:00]  You don't deserve to sit there.  Shut your dumb Italian mouth.  I'm talking, boy.  The drill diva.  Coming soon.  Give me your cock.  Fuck you and fuck your mother.  What do you think of them apples?  Oh, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:50:30]  Getting more gooder every day.  Big announcements on the way.  What song is this?  Like Sanford and Son.  My favorite Doors song.  Peace Frog.  I am so done with the Doors.  Why?  I can't.  The Doors are timeless.  The second a Doors song comes on, I turn it off.  What's your problem with the Doors?  I'm so burnt on their five hits.  Yes, when's the last time they put out something new? 
[01:51:00]  Come on, get in the studio, you lazy bastards.  That's fucking radio that does that.  Whatever it is.  Whatever it is.  So many great songs that never made radio.  Dude.  That never made you're a home of rock and roll.  Nothing better than a low, groovy jam playing with him just babbling in the background.  Oh, shut up.  That was poetry, my friend.  And I said, Father, why are you a prick? 
[01:51:30]  Shut up.  I love the end.  No, I hate the Doors.  You don't like people are strange?  And he walked on down the hall.  I love the end.  People are strange.  Come on.  A thousand times.  The end?  A thousand times you've heard.  The end I only like because it reminds me of Apocalypse.  Don't you just want to get naked and punch a mirror?  I'm going to fight with a mirror naked.  Oh, I'm bleeding.  We're going to kill ten minutes with the Doors. 
[01:52:00]  This is the end on your home of rock and roll.  Oh, God.  You could go on forever.  The Beaver.  Where's the post, Opie?  You've got to hit the post.  No, I don't know how long this one is.  I never had to play this on regular radio.  Are you kidding me?  Wait, we've got to listen to the opening.  I was too busy playing two times.  Loved me two times.  This is the end.  It goes on forever.  Listen to the drumming.  John Densmore, the most bitter member of the Doors.  He did nothing for this band. 
[01:52:30]  Listen to him.  It's a paintbrush.  Listen to him.  Wow, that's hard to do, John.  Ooh.  Jingle bells.  I like that.  That's Jim.  He wouldn't even let John Densmore do that.  Really?  Hey, this is Ben.  It's Ben.  Hey, this is Ben.  No plan and no guests. 
[01:53:00]  It's Ben.  Keep that huge cock away from my rear end.  I'm doing coke again.  I'm done. 
[01:53:30]  Sorry, Jim.  We can't have Ozzy.  I wish I had more time to think about that.  All right.  Let's fit out, dude.  So we got a call from a guy.  We are actually doing...  No, I actually want to ask you a real question.  We are doing...  Seriously.  About the anniversary.  I thought they were on separate days.  Like the fourth.  I thought originally they were doing separate days.  No, we're not going to do that.  We're not going to do the fourth thing.  We decided that the other day.  So the fourth is cancer email, Jim.  It's a combo.  No, dude, I get so much.  I didn't...  What exactly is... 
[01:54:00]  Because I am done...  I know my shoot schedule is the 28th.  What exactly is the thing?  It's the 31st.  What are they...  It's on the 31st of October.  What kind of party did it happen?  Oh, is this...  Fuck.  I already...  Bob already...  Bob already...  What?  He's trying to get him to say Halloween.  Say Halloween.  I want to hear if you can say it.  Halloween.  Oh, he said it.  Say it again.  Halloween.  It's not bad.  That's what Bob Kelly brought to the program.  The fact that Ben can't say Halloween.  And then we get him in here and he says Halloween perfectly.  No, he certainly did. 
[01:54:30]  That's all you got today?  He went Halloween.  You were all excited because he didn't say Halloween to you, right?  So he told Jim and Jim sets the whole thing up on the air and he says it perfectly.  He said Halloween.  When I was out there, he goes, yeah, we're having a party on Halloween.  I went, what'd you say?  He went Halloween.  And I went, are you fucking with me?  And he goes, no.  I go, Halloween?  He goes, oh, yeah, whatever.  Halloween.  Whatever.  And then I told Jim and he's like, don't do it.  Don't keep your mouth shut.  Yeah.  But I did and then it fucking backfires on me.  Well, Ben probably knew what I was getting at because he kept saying the 31st. 
[01:55:00]  Who the fuck refers to Halloween as the 31st?  Yeah.  He was already on to it.  I know he was.  I hate that.  God.  What do you say for Christmas?  Happy 25th?  Creep?  Yeah.  Nothing on that one?  Jesus.  That was a joke.  Give us a big laugh.  Give us time to let it digest a little.  All right.  Hey, this is Ben.  Huh?  Remember that moment?  Bob, you brought in something for our Opie and Anthony auction?  Yeah, man.  I brought in a couple.  I brought in a couple little things. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, look.  Look the big.  What kind of bag is that?  This is called I'm fucking gay bag.  Wow.  It's a Puma bag.  That's a weird bag.  What color?  What blue is that?  Is that periwinkle?  That's a...  You got to be either black or gay to be carrying that bag around.  And I'm neither.  No.  Well, that's the problem.  But this is electric blue, Anthony.  Is it electric blue?  Yeah.  What does it say on the side?  This right here?  Yeah.  You know what?  I really can't read that. 
[01:56:00]  It says, hold my hand, man.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  I don't know.  Shat and Boxer?  Shat and Boxer?  Wow.  Shat and Boxer.  Shat and Boxer.  Nice talking to you.  All right.  I don't know what that is.  All right.  Items for bid.  All right.  First off, we have...  The big reveal, Anthony.  The big reveal.  Live on our show.  Oh.  Six CDs.  Cool.  Which you'll make around, you know, about 80.  Oh, no.  You'll make some money on those.  You'll sign them, right?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, I'll sign them.  I got a couple.  Wait, wait, wait.  Your CD, Bob?  Yeah.  Okay, good. 
[01:56:30]  And I got this, which is cool.  Brought this in.  Signed by Jim Norton.  Little...  This is the Yellow Discipline Tour.  Signed by Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, he actually made me and Keith wear these.  Yeah.  Around our necks.  All access.  Kenny made laminants, and I made him and Keith wear them.  Just so you could get around backstage, you know.  And they're not even kidding.  They wouldn't let us back at certain places, and we're on the friggin' show.  It says all access, and they wouldn't let you.  He made us wear these, and then he signed them on the back.  What a guy.  He made us wear them.  Keith grabbed his.  I'm not wearing nothing, god damn it. 
[01:57:00]  That little friggin' troll.  Like I'm branded by that motherfucker.  Yeah.  I open for Wanda.  And I got this, too.  The original Colin Quinn show on NBC.  Wow.  I collect these passes.  Remember that?  Yeah.  So this is...  This you'll never get this.  This is an item.  Yeah.  Yes, that is.  I'd like to bring this on the R.T. Roadshow.  Find out how much this is worth.  Yeah.  There's only three episodes done live on NBC.  You guys remember. 
[01:57:30]  Of course.  And then, of course, NBC made a terrible mistake and didn't pick the show up.  Right.  So I figured maybe Colin can sign this.  Or we could, you know, whatever.  All right.  And then I got...  That's a good one.  I got this.  Oh, boy.  See that, Daddy.  Come on.  I brought in my...  What the fuck is that?  It's just...  It's a tissue that was used to nothing.  I coughed into it a few times.  Just a little snot.  Relax.  It's like an airborne Ebola virus.  I brought in my knee brace from when I broke my knee. 
[01:58:00]  Yes, man.  Yeah, I was up in the middle of nowhere in Delhi, New York at the Buena Vista Hotel.  Nobody's up there.  Garden spot.  Yeah.  It's just me.  I'm checking into this shitty hotel.  And there's a guy behind me and he heard me check in.  And I'm turning around.  And he goes, I broke my knee, man.  I was like, you got to be shitting me in the middle of fucking nowhere.  Wait, the Buena Vista, which is the one that they always put comedians at?  Yeah.  That, it's a motel.  It's awful. 
[01:58:30]  I've stayed there before.  Yeah.  We're going up there again.  Me and you.  If I don't have to cancel because of my schedule.  Oh, I hope you cancel.  How was it?  I hope you cancel.  I was fine.  Last time I did it, I bombed.  Really?  I went to the school four times, killed every time.  Headlining.  Going up last.  I go with him.  I'm all cocky.  I think I'm going to go out there and just improv with the crowd.  I picked the wrong black girl in the front row.  She just snaps on me.  The whole crowd turns.  I bomb for 20 minutes. 
[01:59:00]  And I walk off stage.  The guy at the school is laughing at me like, ha ha, you're bombing.  And then I'm like, you know what?  Norton's going to bomb.  If I just bombed, Norton's bombing in front of a black crowd.  There's no way they're going to buy his shit.  But this cocksucker annihilates.  He has like the best set ever.  He's like prolific and saying things and slowing down.  And they're listening and talking.  Nobody's heckling at the end.  They give him a standing ovation.  They're actually, to be honest with you, I've had great success at that school.  I'm due for a good load in the face in that one. 
[01:59:30]  But they've always been great.  They do it in a little theater.  The show is set up well.  Yeah.  But yeah, you know what it is?  You've just been there too much.  That's all.  Sometimes it happens.  You do the gig too much and whatever.  It happens.  Never to jinx my little pal.  I've never seen Jimmy bomb.  I've never seen him bomb.  You see me in situations where it's pretty much I'm headlining or I was working with Dice.  You never saw me at the cellar on a Monday working out or just sitting.  Yeah.  That's the best.  Or the famous night at Dangerfield in front of ten people.  Oh yeah.  Jesus.  I wish we had a tape for that.  Ten people at Dangerfield.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:00:00]  No joke.  It was like ten.  I mean, it was just a Tuesday.  No one knew Jimmy was coming.  It's all about just working on the act.  But that was a great night.  I'll have to go to some of those Monday gigs.  I don't.  Oh, they're great.  Watching Jimmy bomb is the funniest thing ever.  You know he's going to come out in the hallway, spit in the carpet, throw a water bottle.  Whatever's in his hand, he's going to throw.  And just smash.  All angry.  These people.  I hope they all die of something.  And then he's just going to walk out the door.  And then ten minutes later, he's going to come back.  Hey, what's up, man?  You like, you all right? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, I'm fine.  These fucking people.  I've gotten to the point where I get so angry at them when they've grown, I've actually spit on the stage.  Because I physically want to spit on the audience sometimes.  Like, I can't hide my revulsion.  And I've actually come to the point where I will spit on the stage.  He spits in his own house.  So we got the cast.  Yeah, man.  And I got the cast from when I smashed my knee.  And a lot of autographs on that thing.  I got Dane.  Well, yeah, I had to put other people's autographs.  Mine wouldn't really sell anything.  But, yeah, I got Dane Cook signed it.  Gary Gellman signed it. 
[02:01:00]  Jay Davis.  The whole cast and crew of Torgasm signed this thing.  And there's one fat chick signed it, too.  She had a knee brace on.  So I was like, hey.  She signed it.  Yeah, so she signed it.  Nice talking to you.  Thanks.  And then I signed it.  That's a biggie, though.  That's a biggie brace.  This is the brace that gave me atrophy and, yeah, fucked my knee up for, you guys aren't  swearing that much.  Excuse my French.  Messed my knee up.  Let's get Eric in here. 
[02:01:30]  Eric is working on the Opie and Anthony auction.  Hawk, get that up.  As we do a radio show today.  When will the Bob Kelly knee brace go up for auction?  A few minutes.  How about talking into the mic, Ockstall?  The audience can come in and love you.  Put it up in a few minutes.  Yeah, because we want to see what kind of bids you would get right off the bat there, Bob.  Yeah, you got some pizza stains on there, too.  There's little food stains on there.  Certainly.  For me stuffing my fat face in depression.  To eat with your feet?  Oh, you don't understand how much sauce fell in that knee brace.  And Eric wants a lot of these people that win these items to come in personally, right? 
[02:02:00]  Is that what you want to tell people?  I'm going to pick it up personally.  Come in and pick it up personally.  As soon as we verify that you are the winner and that you've paid your money and all that.  A lot of items going away in the next hour.  By the end of the show, 61 items will be gone.  You won't be able to bid on any more.  So keep checking the Opie and Anthony auction through opieandanthony.com.  Dick Cavett DVDs went for what?  $202 and $296?  Wow.  That's done officially?  Nice.  All right.  Very good.  Right now, a lot of WWE stuff going away in the next hour. 
[02:02:30]  Nice.  Take a look.  The George Foreman Grill.  Just over an hour.  How much did that go for?  George Foreman.  George Foreman autographed, right?  Of course.  That was when he was in here.  George Foreman autographed grills.  I'm surprised.  Only going for like $130, $150.  I'm actually tempted to get one of them.  Aren't they all autographed?  I won't pay for it.  I'll just steal it.  Hey, we've got to get Martini Steven here, too, because we've got a couple comedians in  the studio.  And you guys have done a lot of radio shows. 
[02:03:00]  So we definitely want you guys involved in this next little piece of tape we found.  Steve knows the back history of this.  One of the dudes from MADtv.  I think you know him.  Was on a radio show down in Miami.  And he wasn't that funny.  Yeah.  And I give the radio show a lot of credit.  They called him out after he left the studio.  And said how much he sucked.  And this guy heard the whole thing and came running back in the studio and started a fight  with the guys.  Oh, he's doing some laps around the studio. 
[02:03:30]  Whoa!  Yes, Steve?  What are you doing?  Hey!  Trent, Trent, Trent.  Steve!  Hey!  You can't find a parking spot because now we've got Bob in here.  Bob, move over.  There you go.  Bob's moving over.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Wow, thank God.  It's very crowded in here.  That's his hybrid car.  Yeah, what's wrong with you, Bob?  You really?  It's a hybrid car?  Look at it.  I've had one for about a year now. 
[02:04:00]  Why?  It's right in front of you, Bob.  That's the reality.  Why not?  You make enough money to pay for gas like a human being?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you put in it?  What else do you put in it?  Electricity?  It runs on honey, water, and bees.  It's a hybrid.  It's a hybrid.  Part cock, part mouth.  You can never hook a crap in it.  I love my car.  What does it run on, honestly?  Electricity?  Yeah, it runs on half.  The combustion engine fuels the battery, so you don't really have to plug it in or anything.  It just constantly goes.  If he goes to accelerate on an on-ramp, it's the gas motor. 
[02:04:30]  It's the gas motor.  But then once he's up to highway speed, the gas motor shuts off, and it turns into the battery-powered.  Right.  Electric.  It just goes.  Electric.  So you get roughly 60 miles an hour.  So you have gas in it, just that you don't have-  Yeah, you have a-  It's like a lawnmower.  Yeah, you've got a 10-gallon gas tank, and ultimately you get 400 miles to the tank.  Jesus.  But you can only go 60 miles an hour.  No, no, no.  60 miles per gallon.  I'm sorry.  I misspoke.  How fucked up is that? 
[02:05:00]  His brakes charge the battery.  You don't look like the type of guy that would give a shit about the universe.  Yeah, well, I generally wouldn't until I realized the gas was going to hit three bucks a gallon.  The universe of his wallet.  So you don't have enough- the money was killing you.  Yeah, it was really just filling up an SUV.  I had a huge GMC Envoy.  What?  Oh, for Christ.  What do you have now?  What's it now?  Where is it?  Enough.  What is it now?  What is it called?  What?  The car I have now?  Yeah.  Toyota Prius.  The Prius.  They have the faggiest names for those highlights.  A Prius.  It's the Toyota Prius. 
[02:05:30]  I'm driving a Toyota Prius.  Kind of like penis.  Almost.  But that was cool.  They would definitely sell more if they had a manly name for the damn thing.  Look, they're coming out with the Highlander.  Jimmy.  Don't be shy.  Just talk.  The Highlander.  Jesus.  All right.  Fine.  Get it over with.  There's nothing that.  There's nothing going on down there.  There's a penis.  There's nothing.  There's nothing.  There's no bulge there.  I know.  There really isn't.  I see you should call your penis the Prius.  You can't see it, but it's there.  Why did I walk in here?  You didn't.  You drove that. 
[02:06:00]  You're a Prius.  All right.  So what's up with this Miami Classic Rock station?  Aries Spears, who's on MADtv, was on the Ron and Paul show on Big 106.  And I guess they didn't really like his performance.  He didn't do any impressions and he wasn't really funny.  So after he walked out of the station, they started bashing him on air and he heard it in the car  and came running back in and picked a fight with them on air.  Aries Spears, I haven't seen him in many, many years. 
[02:06:30]  He actually, I remember when I was doing open mics at a place called Arbidjons in, what was it?  New Jersey.  It was right around where I lived, East Brunswick.  Some, you know, hotel that had a bar.  And Aries' mother would bring him in because he was young.  He was like, he's from North Brunswick.  I think he was like 16 or 15, so he couldn't go in by himself legally.  So his mom would bring him in and he would do open mics and stuff.  How did he do it, like 16?  He was funny.  He did impressions.  I mean, back then, I mean, you know, again, I was new and he was,  he started, I think I'm a little bit before him, but not much.  And I haven't seen him.  Last time I saw him was when I bombed an East Orange after the Rodney King beating. 
[02:07:00]  I did a black crowd after the Rodney King beating and it was, it wasn't like, I was  just awful and I wasn't ready to do that kind of room.  And then Bob Levy goes on and starts destroying until he sees a black cop and he goes, why  don't you take a nightstick and hit yourself with it?  And then he lost the crowd.  Oh, that drunk Bob has balls.  What an ass.  Oh, he has balls.  That lost the crowd?  Yeah, but Ares went on and Bill Bellamy was hosting.  That's the last time I saw Ares Spears.  That's whatever, 10 years ago. 
[02:07:30]  And I guess he went on this show and didn't perform.  Does he do well on MADtv?  I don't know.  Yeah, he does.  I've seen MADtv.  He's the black dude, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  He's pretty funny, man.  He's got a pretty funny Shaq.  Yeah, Shaq.  He does MC Hammer.  He does that Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown thing.  He's kind of funny.  I met him one time at the Carolines.  He was, it's kind of weird though.  It's like he's kind of cool.  You know what I mean?  You meet a guy like that.  Hey, what's up?  You know, he's like, he almost acts like a rapper.  Yeah, he doesn't want to be wacky like a comic. 
[02:08:00]  He wants to have a cool rock star attitude.  Now, I want to know if these guys in Florida, because Natterman, Dan Natterman had a problem  where he went on a station like this, bombed, didn't do well.  And then they trashed him when he left.  And so Natterman called in.  And I've heard the tape online.  It's really funny because they smashed him.  But again, you know how it is.  You're in a no-win situation when you're calling from the car.  I'm like, Dan, why did you call?  He's like, I was angry.  He has a problem.  Oh, Dan's a fucking problem.  And he actually threatened, he said something about he wanted the building to blow up.  Or he said something really terrorist-oriented. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, jeez.  Maybe somebody, one of the interns, could find that online.  When are we going to get Dan in here?  Dude, I wanted to have him in.  I got his, let's try for, I don't know, tomorrow.  I love that guy.  Can I leave one of this?  Psychotic.  He is psychotic.  Try to get him in tomorrow because he is psychotic.  That's the best tasting pickle I've ever had.  Yeah, Dan is a sociopath.  He's a weird dude.  And he creeps girls out.  Oh, he's the greatest.  Oh, who touched you?  Dan's a fucking classic.  We were in the last comic standing.  I'm standing next to him as they're picking up people and they're not picking him.  And he just kept going, Bobby, it's going to be a fucking bloodbath, I swear to God. 
[02:09:00]  My name isn't called very soon.  People are going to die.  All right.  So these guys started to move on with their show after this bad interview with him.  Dan Cook had a problem down there, too.  He walked out on one of those.  I don't know if it is.  Well, you guys do a lot of radio.  It's not easy.  Down in Miami.  It's not easy to walk into a lot of these shows and just be funny because a bunch of  these guys are just the tools.  Yeah, these guys just walked in.  He goes, he ignored them when he walked in. 
[02:09:30]  I don't know anything about this show, but I've heard the stories over the years from  you guys.  And it's like, you know, you're walking into an environment where they're like, hey,  Bob, what's going on?  And then you have to be funny in that environment.  Yeah, you have to do your act.  It's got to be tough.  What show is this?  That's the exact voice.  And they laugh when they laugh too much.  Oh.  Yeah, I didn't even say anything, you moron.  Sorry about that.  I thought I was supposed to laugh there.  That was good.  That's exactly the way you did it.  No, I know.  Trust me, I've heard enough of this.  I've never really had that, man.  The only time I thought I was going to have it was in Sacramento.  There was a guy where I was kind of like a dick to comics. 
[02:10:00]  But he turned out to be okay.  But I was so ready to attack him.  Yeah?  Yeah, on commercial.  I would have just cursed and not even cared if it drew people to the gig.  But he was actually okay.  He turned out to be all right.  All right, why don't we listen to the tape here?  I would have.  Yeah, right at him.  Actually, not at him.  That's an assault.  How do you say his name?  Ares?  Ares Spears.  Ares Spears.  Do they have the tape of him bombing?  No.  So the tape picks up with the show just moving on to other business, I guess.  And Ares was on his way back into the studio and interrupts them. 
[02:10:30]  He's a big dude from what I remember.  I was a big kid.  Yeah, he wasn't when he was young.  He was real small.  So here we go.  Oh, they have to do Rock and Roll still.  Yeah, 820.  Hey, not good enough to do a talk show for four straight hours.  Got to fit in that Rock and Roll.  Come on.  What's wrong?  What's the show name?  Paul and Young Ron or something like that?  I don't know.  The Big 105.9 Miami's Classic Rock. 
[02:11:00]  Classic Rock.  Classic Rock that really rocks, everybody.  The home of Classic Rock.  That's the new one.  Classic Rock that really rocks.  Really rocks.  Oh, there's other Classic Rock out there.  Do they really rock?  They really rock.  Let me take a look at my list here.  Here's Hart with Barracuda.  Those radio, and I've worked for all of them, so, you know.  But I always thought it was such a stupid thing.  The home of Rock and Roll.  And all the other rock stations in your area.  They're not the home of Rock and Roll.  No.  We're the home of Rock and Roll. 
[02:11:30]  Ah!  Oh, no.  Right on my fucking foot!  That fucking thing fell again right on my fucking foot!  This could be a problem.  I don't mean to laugh.  I just love shit like this.  I can't tell you how many times last week I asked for this to be fixed,  and it just fell on my fucking bad foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot, and it just fell on it. 
[02:12:00]  Don't laugh.  I'm talking.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  He's got one of those bad...  Why did that fall again?  He's got one of those bad...  Why did that fall again on my bad foot?  He's got one of those bad foot pieces.  Dude, I got a boot on my foot because I have tendinitis, I have arthritis,  and I have ligament damage.  He's got old man foot.  And right on my goddamn foot, that's the third time that fucking thing has fucking fallen! 
[02:12:30]  Third time.  Holy shit, is that aggravating!  Anthony and Jimmy are very serious, and me and Bob can't stop laughing.  It should not have fallen again.  Right on my foot.  Holy shit!  I saw his face.  He just heard that freaking whack!  Scared the shit out of everybody, and then you look at him. 
[02:13:00]  Did scare me, man.  He looked like a stress doll.  Somebody squeezed his gut.  And then he just...  I got a foot thing on my fucking foot.  Look at his foot.  I got an arm thing on my foot.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing he has to wear.  Big foot thing.  I have enough problems.  He's going snowboarding after the show.  I'm trying to avoid surgery.  Yeah.  And I have stage four damage.  I have stage three damage.  I'm one inch from surgery.  And now you get stage four. 
[02:13:30]  And I want to bite somebody's fucking face for that.  How did that happen?  I want to know who fixed that.  Are you on the AZT for the stage?  Why did it not happen?  Why was that not fixed?  No one fixed it.  It wasn't fixed.  Holy shit, is that irritating.  It was fixed.  It wouldn't have fallen.  How big was the thing that fell, though?  It's this big.  It's a piece of...  What is it?  It's solid.  And it falls.  It's like...  It's probably eight inches off the ground.  Opie probably has fishing string over there.  Just...  All right.  Right now, again.  Just ball funk.  Quack. 
[02:14:00]  My fucking foot.  I got a foot to my foot.  On my foot.  Left-hand fucking foot.  I want that fixed.  Immediately.  Right in the middle of my goddamn fucking foot.  It's so...  I am so...  You're leaving Wednesday.  They'll never fix it.  Do you people think at HBO there's going to be stuff falling on his foot?  We're going to lose Jimmy because he's not going to want to come back to life.  Hey, falling on his feet. 
[02:14:30]  Bingo Pants has a great idea now, though.  Come on.  Bingo Pants.  How you doing?  Hey.  Can you guys put that thing that fell on Jimmy's foot on the auction, too?  Yeah, now it's a famous thing.  It's famous.  It's a famous thing.  It's the thing that fell on his foot.  What happens is this.  If his foot goes to stage four, we can just put his foot up there.  Under the console, it's six inches off the ground.  There's like a little shelf.  And this is up on top of that, so it's falling from a height.  Yeah.  Look at that.  It's not that high, but when the end of that smashes your foot, it hurts. 
[02:15:00]  Look at that.  Holy shit.  And I asked for that last week to be fixed.  There was screws coming out of it.  I understand.  Whatever, man.  I'm just going to start really being fucking nasty.  Yes.  When you ask for something to be fixed like that, because it's a physical hazard, why isn't  it done?  We have a lot of audio that proves that you asked for it to be fixed.  Holy fucking shit.  Is that annoying?  Oh, man.  But really funny.  Yeah.  It's not like your karma didn't deserve that.  I hate him.  I hope he dies of cancer.  Fuck them.  You die. 
[02:15:30]  Then you have something fall on your foot.  Exactly.  It's not right.  The universe came back and smashed your foot.  Wow.  Holy shit.  You okay?  Don is in New York today, so we'll get it fixed.  Oh, it's all fixed, Charles?  Why don't you just sit down?  Don't you just fucking throw it over there.  If they put it up, I'm going to throw it through the window.  What?  Feel how heavy that is.  Can somebody want to weigh that?  That is so heavy.  And what it's got are these little fasteners that aren't working, I guess.  Hey, Ryan from Florida, Feels for Jimmy. 
[02:16:00]  Let's say hi to Ryan.  A lot of people feeling for you right now.  Go ahead, Ryan.  Hey, man.  What the hell's up with that prima donna?  Prima donna.  Dude, I'm sitting here, and something falls on my injured foot that I asked for to be fixed.  I didn't say it's painted the wrong color.  It fell on my foot.  Here goes the tear coming from all the blue-collar workers out there that fall off the ladders  and stuff every day and just get up and go back to work without saying a word.  Well, dude, first of all, then, fuck them.  They're cowards.  I didn't walk off the job.  I'm still here.  But what do guys do when they fall off a ladder? 
[02:16:30]  First of all, I didn't fall off a ladder.  Nobody does.  If something fell on your foot, that's like, you know, getting a cut or something on your  hand and, you know, have to go to the emergency room or something for a cut.  Yeah, really?  Is that what it's like?  Stupid.  It fell on my foot.  I asked for it to be fixed.  And let me tell you something.  If I was a painter and I asked for something to be fixed and it fell, I'd complain.  Any painter or any other job would complain, blue-collar or not.  Nothing ever gets fixed, man.  Well, that's annoying.  You need someone to hold your hand, Jimmy?  No. 
[02:17:00]  It's just annoying, dude.  You're in the middle of something and you just feel it smash your foot.  Yeah.  Foot!  You've asked for it to be fixed and it's not fixed, and it's like one of a million things  he asked for.  If we were working construction, sir, I don't think it would be a problem because it would  be something that happens on a daily basis.  When you come in to do a radio show every day, you don't expect to have heavy things falling  on you.  Yeah, but Jason from Michigan makes a good point.  I'm going to add to it.  If you didn't throw the power drill away, you could have freaking fixed that thing.  You could have fixed it yourself, Jimmy.  Crawled under there and drilled a few zip screws in. 
[02:17:30]  Exactly.  But you had to throw the drill away because it wasn't good enough for you.  He's a fancy man.  I smell foot diva.  Fancy feet.  Foot diva promo on the way.  The problem is this.  I've been having a serious problem with my foot.  I am worried about it and I'm trying to take care of it.  I'm fucking hobbling around on this cocksucker awful boot and I have to worry about sticking  my fucking feet under the console and having shit fall.  I would love to get that weight and see how much that weighs.  That really, right on the bone of my foot. 
[02:18:00]  I'd say about four pounds.  Not four pounds.  How did your foot get so screwed up?  Because I had twisted it.  I have falling arches or whatever I have.  My feet are a mess so I needed orthotics.  Yeah.  So when you have problems with your feet like that, you stand a certain way subconsciously.  You don't realize my foot really hurts.  I'm really, really angry.  Oh, boy.  That's how I messed up my knee.  I'm sorry.  I was still talking about my foot.  Yeah.  Why do you, when you hurt something, though, you have to keep repeating the body part? 
[02:18:30]  Like when I, my knee, and he's like, my foot, my foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot.  I didn't know what to say.  See how funny this can be when it's on you?  Oh, see?  See?  I hurt my foot, dude.  I didn't, it's a foot thing on my foot.  I didn't know what it was called.  Is there a way that during commercials or something you could pull him losing his mind  when that falls?  Because I got to hear it again.  He lost his mind right there.  Dude, you know what it is?  My foot hurt last night because I had, uh, the bandage wasn't as tight as it has been. 
[02:19:00]  I was trying to get a looser bandage on it, and today, now it's throbbing, and I'm just,  I'm so, I want to kick something.  Not with this foot thing.  What would they do if they had to do surgery, like you said?  What would they be doing to your foot?  They would go, I don't know.  I have, I know on the left side of my right foot, I have, uh, it's a bone problem, and  on the right side, it's a nerve.  I was getting like, I was getting like numbness in my leg for months when I would sit, like  it was like a sciatic problem.  This genius doctor I go to, she helped, so far I have none of that leg numbness anymore. 
[02:19:30]  She's fixing me.  Yeah.  She's fixing me, it's slow, and she puts a medicated bandage on it, but I got tendinitis,  I got a little arthritis, I got so fucked up, so I twisted it twice, never, and now, you  guys know who I was, I was hobbling along since like May.  You're a bad little paw.  I finally got it fixed, and it's like a slow process, but I can't be in a cast, I gotta,  I gotta, you know, whatever, I gotta be out there doing, you can't have stuff falling  on your foot either.  No.  Oh, dude, that's what annoys me is shit happens, but when you say, look, I have a problem with  my thing here, I'm injured, can you not have that thing underneath the desk falling 
[02:20:00]  on it?  Say your foot.  For the third, I know, you're right.  Say your foot, you jicken, don't say my thing.  I'm not a jicken, stupid.  We're gonna find the audio.  Halloween.  But I think I, I think I caused that, because someone said something really funny, and I  either hit this really hard, or kicked something under my thing, and I think that was all it  took to, because this thing was barely, you know, barely hanging on.  Well, dude, if you caused it by doing this, that's not sturdy workmanship. 
[02:20:30]  No.  Workmanship.  Yes, I said it.  Worksmanship.  Worksmanship.  I really, I really have never done a real man's work in my life.  No.  I want to get some elbow grime.  No, no, no.  And you were talking about a painter.  Well, he said painter.  The guy on the fall race, painter, that's why I said that.  All right.  A painter, what the fuck, what does painter do?  We're gonna, we're gonna find the audio.  We're gonna find it after break you wanted to do, Art?  What do you want to do, Derek?  I can't edit it out until we break in the computer.  All right, yeah, yeah.  I just want to hear it, because he yelled so loud. 
[02:21:00]  I didn't mean to blow out anybody's ears.  Oh, I just gotta hear it.  Well, why don't we get back to the big 105.9.  Right, the big 105.9.  Miami's Classic Rock Station.  That's where you're at, right?  All right, we don't have to set this up anymore, do we?  No.  Aries Spears.  Aries Spears from Ed TV went on the show.  Thing fell on his foot.  He got pissed.  What happened?  Didn't have a good appearance, and the guys, after he left the studio, called him out on  it, and Aries heard that and ran back in the studio and started, uh, a nice verbal fight. 
[02:21:30]  So, dude, this is actually, this is actually him coming back into this, you know.  Come here, baby.  This is actually him coming back into the studio.  Yeah, here we go.  So, the show's moving on to other business, uh, uh, that's much more important, like playing  heart records.  Yeah.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Well, you said, hold on, hold on, we're on the air now.  Yeah, let's keep on the air.  All right, you're back, you're back.  Okay.  Oh, this is good.  Why does every, uh, DJ on commercial radio sound exactly the same? 
[02:22:00]  Hey, we're back on the air now.  Oh, I gotta put on my radio guy voice.  We gotta get a montage of all these guys that are one-market sensations, and you will hear  the same thing.  They have the same exact voice.  Don't they teach that to them, though?  They have to enunciate and say words.  There was a time when you got into radio, you had to have a really good voice.  And then, uh, you know, somewhere along the line, you just, you just went on the air  as yourself.  And the people that did that became really successful.  But these other guys can't see that, so they have to, hey!  They have to stay with the tried and true, which is that fake radio voice, everybody! 
[02:22:30]  It's so typical.  Like, they, it's not even a, a different radio voice.  It's all the same radio voice they put on.  It's really, they all sound alike.  Yeah, but it's kind of fun to do.  It is fun when you're doing it yourself.  Just hang it out here, tuck it into the microphone.  Hey, how you doing?  This is, uh, Robert Kelly on RKL Live.  How you doing, Bob?  Good to hear you.  Good to have you back on the program.  My friend Jimmy's usually just, uh, fucked up his foot on his foot.  Something on his foot. 
[02:23:00]  He got something on his foot, on his foot.  Yeah, a foot foot.  I wonder if he has a foot fetish.  Hysterical, 935.  Hi, I'm a woman.  Now, guys, don't make fun.  Fuck you, cunt.  Anyway.  Just for once, I wish one of those guys would say that.  No, you'll never, you'll never hear honesty.  A hole.  Every one of these one-market sensations has to have a hole with them.  You'll never hear honesty like that on those shows. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, we fought.  We fought for years, Anthony and I.  They wanted a hole on our program.  Just to balance it out, you know.  We said no to the hole.  Oh, guys.  Oh, well, Opie, now maybe we shouldn't go down that road.  Don't go down that road, yeah.  You fucking cunt.  You shocked me on that one.  I'm a shock jock.  We're shocking.  Shock jock jock.  Shock jocks.  Shock jocks.  All right, here we go.  So, uh...  I gotta go back, because you gotta hear the fake voices.  Why? 
[02:24:00]  Oh, we'll get to ya.  We'll get to ya.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, we're on the air now.  Yeah, let's keep on the air.  Are you back?  You're back.  Okay.  Oh, this is good.  Yeah.  Now, you know, radio and TV is all about ratings.  Let's go ahead and get some ratings for you now.  We don't need to do it.  You can leave if you want, or you can say.  You verbally thrashed me when I left.  Now, you verbally thrashed us in the hallway on the way out.  I didn't thrash you in the hallway.  Yeah, you did.  The guy came in and told us what you said.  I've been doing stand-up for 15 years. 
[02:24:30]  I've been doing thousands of radio stations.  All right, so what happened here?  Okay, so I know the deal.  You didn't do diddly on our show.  You just came in and said...  Oh, diddly.  Hey, whoa, those are fighting words.  When you don't do diddly, you are in deep trouble with other radio personalities.  Wow.  Diddly, uh-oh.  He did not go there.  He did not go there.  He did, O.B.  You've got to give your share of diddly on our show.  How do you respond to diddly?  You have to get up and just go.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God. 
[02:25:00]  By the way, why did we graduate to the taking the pants down to fart there?  Because people have complained there's not enough hot in the show.  Jimmy pulled his plump little cheeks out.  He did.  He pulled his little baby ass out.  Shoves the mic right in the crack.  You've got splatter all over your ass now.  You have to.  But you know what the difference is, though?  As awful as it is, every one of you, you're drawn to those plump little delicious...  Those two little soft, fleshy lemons.  I'm just hoping a poopy pops out. 
[02:25:30]  That would happen.  Believe me, if I shot a log onto the mic...  That was the closest you got to having a little poopy pop out.  It actually was.  A little nugget fall out.  A little rumbly, yeah.  It's not going to be a nugget, dude.  It's going to be something that hits the mic, lands on the floor, and in my socks.  It hits your foot, and you go, my foot.  I got shit on my foot, foot.  I thought it was going to be soft serve ice cream.  Carvel.  Swirly swirls.  Fudgy the dick joke artist.  All right, let's get back to Paul and Young Ron, everybody. 
[02:26:00]  Right?  Paul and Young Ron.  He didn't do diddly.  Diddly.  On their show.  The deal.  You didn't do diddly on our show.  I didn't like the way you presented it.  What are you talking about?  You're having a conversation.  Here's my point to you, and this is why I turned the car around and came back.  I'm glad you came back.  You were thrashing me, and all the listeners heard it.  You were thrashing me until I'd get the freak out of your studio and go back over there  to the hippity-hop rap station where they have six listeners.  Can I talk?  I'm not done.  I think I deserve the right to talk.  You thrashed me when I left.  And I'll respond.  Say to everything you said on the radio to my face. 
[02:26:30]  Just let him respond.  Say it to my face.  I'm going to say it to your face, and I'm going to respond to why I said that about the hip-hop.  You walked out in the hallway and told this kid that, man, I went to the hip-hop station,  and it got along fine.  I did all my material.  That pissed me off, because you didn't do any material on this show.  Because the way that it was presented to me here.  How was it presented to you?  Let me tell you something.  When you do shows, and you're a comedian, and you do impressions,  no one likes for you to just go, hey, do this, do that.  Bravo!  There you go.  I like this Aries guy. 
[02:27:00]  Absolutely.  Bravo.  That is so fucking true, as far as regular radio goes.  Why don't you do that impression you do?  Do some Shaq.  Can we get audio of that?  I hear you do Shaq.  Let me hear you do a little Shaq.  Bravo for calling him out, because that's what commercial radio does all the time.  Was that Jimmy?  I was going to say, if we get audio of him, is there any way we can get audio of him actually on that show?  I'd love to hear how that went.  Yeah, what happened beforehand.  Yeah.  See, and it's not easy.  We struggle with this all the time. 
[02:27:30]  You can guess in.  You want to make him feel comfortable, and you want to make him feel part of the environment.  You don't want to ever just go, hey, Bob, and make him do a bit.  Especially not his.  Yeah, that's true.  Marshmally?  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  But no, the difference is that it's just...  I was going to go with this, and then name one of your bits, but I didn't know any.  Oh.  Because then that would have worked better.  We could take care of that right now.  There's a CD.  Thank you, sir.  Because I was going to, you know, try to set you up for one of my bits.  Yeah, go ahead.  Send me up.  Hey, Bob, naps. 
[02:28:00]  I don't even know that joke.  What the fuck?  Did you read that off my CD?  Yeah, it's track 12.  I don't remember the bit, but I bet it goes like this.  Dude, I love taking fucking naps.  Fucking naps rule.  If it was on your CD, it'd be like, I fucking hate naps.  First of all, that wouldn't be on my CD.  That was very hurtful, Bob.  It certainly was.  Dude, I love naps.  All right, let me try it again.  You're right.  I am a negative little douche.  Guys, guys in studio, we got a very funny guy, Bob Kelly. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, Bob Kelly's with us.  Bob, how are you guys doing?  I hear you just got back from California.  Yeah, I was in California out there doing some stuff, you know, some LA stuff.  Do you like California, Bob?  Actually, I don't.  I hate California, you know.  I'm Irish, and, you know, I look Spanish.  Everybody just walks up to me out there.  La la la la la la.  And you're like, what the hell are you saying?  That's fantastic.  We'll be back after 15 minutes of commercials. 
[02:29:00]  Wait, that wasn't the joke.  Oh.  Anyways.  That's how it goes, because you have a track in your CD, California Sucks.  See how easy this is?  And they really do laugh at the setup.  And you're like, okay.  Hey, Bob, it's now fall.  Do you like raking leaves?  Oh, I hate raking leaves.  It's funny you mention that.  Why do you hate raking leaves?  Ah, because you know what?  As you're raking, they're falling.  Oh.  And you're raking, they're still there.  You know?  I'm like, hey, why don't you come up with this season called Fell? 
[02:29:30]  All the leaves fell.  I do this once.  That's kind of funny.  That's a good bit, right?  Yeah, it's all right, bro.  Oh, shit.  My foot.  Dude, you know what?  It's okay to laugh at another person if that makes you feel better.  Yeah.  Are you out of your mind?  If that happened to me, you'd still be laughing.  The first thing out of your mouth would be, ha, ha.  No, it would not.  It's not happening to you, and we got three months of great material out of it.  When you hurt your leg, I wanted just to rush to your aid. 
[02:30:00]  No, you didn't.  I certainly did.  I heard you guys.  I listened to the audio.  I was on Vicodin, almost dying.  And then you go, listen, Dane, you have to get us that audio.  Well, he did.  You keep your mouth shut and you get us that audio.  You're right.  Okay, Bob.  Hey, man, feel better.  Oh, Bob.  All right, man.  All right, guys.  We're going to go back to the Paul and Young Ron Tater.  Oh, sure.  I've been obsessed with kicking his leg since he heard of it.  So Ari Spears calls the guys out, basically saying, you know, you need an environment to be funny.  You can't just walk in and be funny. 
[02:30:30]  Hey, be funny.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Station, and we got along.  I did all my material.  That pissed me off because you didn't do any material on this show.  Because the way that it was presented to me here.  How was it presented to you?  Let me tell you something.  When you do shows and you're a comedian and you do impressions, no one likes for you to just go, hey, do this.  Let's do that.  No one did that.  It can be presented in a better way.  We started talking about Red Sox.  It's your job as the host.  You are the host.  It's your job as the host to present in such a way where we can do it well.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Just let me say something real quick.  That's a great point. 
[02:31:00]  We've had every, every, every major comedian that has come through the Miami Improv, the Improv at the heart.  Has Jimmy Norton ever done this show?  I've never worked in Miami Improv, but I want to know how Jim Neighbors is on this show.  What an awful voice this guy has.  He should sing Oh My Papa and then catch the hymn.  You wonder why shit falls on your foot.  My knee is actually bothering me now.  Oh, no.  Did it hit your knee?  No, it hit my foot, but I twisted it.  Sue.  Sue.  Sue.  There it is. 
[02:31:30]  Sue.  No.  No?  I don't sue.  This is the Jim Norton's XM Satellite Radio.  It's the new name of the company we work for.  And the new name of this program.  I mean, that would be actually a really nice thing.  Oh, that could be worth the pain.  All right.  Can we go back to the tape, guys?  Back to that tape.  Of course.  The guy said every at least four times, so he must have had everyone on.  They did the same thing to Dane.  I was down there with him.  Miami.  He walked in.  They go.  He ignored him.  And then he goes, you don't look that funny. 
[02:32:00]  Let's see what you got.  Oh, that's good.  He goes, Kobe, go.  And he's like, what?  That's a passive-aggressive shit.  Guys that aren't funny that get mad that you're funny and you're going to come in and  fuck their women and leave town.  I wonder if this is the same guy.  This sounds like the guy.  Ask Dane.  Talk to him.  Just let me say something real quick.  We've had every, every, every major comedian that has come through the Miami Improv.  I want you to understand why I turned around.  Hold on.  Let's let Tony speak for a second.  Let me talk just for a second. 
[02:32:30]  As far as people doing impressions, we've had Kevin Pollack.  We've had Daryl Hammond.  We've had other comedians that do impressions and we say, hey, man, do this impression.  And they do it.  It's no big deal.  I wasn't here when they, when all those people you just named, I wasn't here when they were  here.  So I don't know what they did and therefore I don't care.  My point in turning around and coming back here was that you were talking very tough when  I left here.  Yo, my man, I'm from the streets of New York.  I know what tough talk sounds like.  And if you're going to talk about me that way, do it to my face. 
[02:33:00]  I'll do it to your ears.  Oh, yeah.  We're coming up after these words.  This is an angry Negro we got here.  Wow.  Coming up after this twofer from Bad Company.  Let me tell you something.  White guys will consistently back down to black guys.  Well, it depends on how they were talking.  They were just trashing them, but it sounds like they were like really probably talking  shit.  I wish we had audio of that.  I would love to hear that.  Well, let's find out what happens next.  Yes.  I'm scared.  On the Paul and Young Ron show. 
[02:33:30]  I'm scared.  Miami's classic rock.  I'm scared.  To my face.  I'll do it to your comedy.  Say everything that you said to my face.  What did I say?  That was so tough.  Talk the way you were talking a second ago.  I said, man, go down to the hip-hop station where they got eight listeners.  Why don't you go down there?  So it's necessary to say, my CD is trash and all that.  Because if I had never heard you say it, if I had done everything that y'all wanted me  to do, if I had done everything that y'all wanted me to do, the way you wanted me to  do it, you would have still said my CD was trash?  I didn't say it was trash. 
[02:34:00]  I said it wasn't funny.  What did he say?  I said it wasn't funny.  What did he say, Ish?  I know what I said.  You don't have to burn it in my mouth.  We heard you.  That's fine.  I don't care.  I'm sending it right to your face.  Okay, let me give you a real quick lesson.  Because I'm going to be as professional as I can be under the circumstances.  I'm going to go ahead and now that we done got all this out the way and leave your building  or as you said, your freaking station.  But I'm going to tell you right now, be very careful what you say about people and how  you say it.  Because I'm going to let you know something else about black people.  When you talk like that to us and about us, you get your ass whipped. 
[02:34:30]  So if you got something tough to say, say it now.  And I guarantee you I'll whip your ass in the studio.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I like this guy.  Dude, that had...  All that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head.  I didn't do it, Bob.  Relax.  I swear I'll blow this nigger's head all over this town.  Dude, that had to bring people into the club. 
[02:35:00]  I mean, if I was home listening to a guy scream like that, how do you not go see him?  Black people.  Anybody.  I would just go see...  To see a comedian who just went off like that, even if it wasn't funny, just to scream  and threaten to beat up the awful local host.  I don't like how he...  I totally see his point.  But again, why did it have to go, let me tell you something about black people?  That was a little bit...  Well, they might have raised the racial issue.  And again, I'm playing devil's advocate.  But they were saying go to the hip-hop station.  So maybe they kind of brought that theme into it.  I don't know.  But he seemed pretty annoyed that they said go to the hip-hop station. 
[02:35:30]  I think he was using the fact that white people are afraid of black people.  They're in his little tirade.  Maybe.  It's true, though, man.  They have different skills.  It is absolutely true.  Well, there's 11 of the zoo crew there and one of him.  And they're all going...  Yeah, a zoo crew.  Exactly.  How much courage do you think those guys have?  When was the last time you saw a black guy alone, though?  A famous black guy alone.  He had people.  You think?  He had five people.  Awesome.  Two cousins, an uncle, an aunt, who's his money manager.  Why don't we get him on the phone?  His business manager.  Yeah, we definitely got to talk to this guy.  Where was the hole during this whole thing? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, where was the hole?  Getting ready to do her news?  Guys.  Yeah, he's a pretty big guy, though.  I wouldn't fuck with him.  All right, let's see how this ends, guys.  Guarantee you, I'll whip your ass in the studio.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  I'll whip your ass in the studio.  Gary, get security right now.  It's not a...  What a faggot!  Faggot!  Master Poe doesn't understand.  He's rushing over to their studio right now. 
[02:36:30]  Yes.  Gentlemen, I have to hop on a plane.  No, Poe, it's recorded.  Gentlemen.  No, why?  Angry Negro.  It's still a heated discussion.  All of a sudden, that's how he ends it.  Get security right now.  He's a big guy threatening to beat them up.  Yeah, he...  Dude.  He was bringing it to the next level right there.  He really was.  He was bringing it to...  He was trying to get somebody to say something.  He wanted to punch somebody.  He was trying to get somebody to say something like,  Yeah, we'll do it, bitch.  Right.  Pank.  You know, and start throwing punches.  Get security!  Get security right now!  He was trying to make it sound like he was still a tough guy 
[02:37:00]  as he's calling for help.  That's what I mean.  Get security before I do something like get my teeth knocked out.  Hold me back!  Hold me back!  I'll throw my headphones right at your face, sir.  All right, let's continue.  Oh, yeah.  We're writing anybody here now.  I'm with your ass in this studio.  We're not going to whip everybody.  Get security right now.  It's not a racist issue.  Let's not get violent here.  It's not a question of getting violent.  You trashed me verbally on the radio.  You came in here.  You had an opportunity to sell tickets for your show, 
[02:37:30]  and you did squat.  You know, it's amazing how you hide behind your mic,  and you talk real tough.  Nobody's hiding in here.  No one threatened you.  Not one person threatened you, dude.  See me on the streets and talk to me that way.  I'll walk out the street right now and talk to you.  And you get your fat ass one.  Maybe so.  I don't give a crap.  I'm not here to fight.  Hey, do the clumps before you go, buddy.  Yeah, you egging me on you.  Oh, that's so brave.  As security walks in.  Fuck you, assholes.  Security walks in, and now he's talking.  I will back up.  That was real brave.  You heard security walk in and tell him, you know, it's time to go, 
[02:38:00]  and then he chimes in.  Yeah, because now, I mean, obviously security's between.  Right.  Ari's and.  What a pussy.  That is really funny to say.  It's funny, but it's such a pussy move.  Do the clumps now.  That's the word, the clumps, too.  Do the clumps.  And then buddy.  He should have used the N-word right there.  Nobody should have whispered it.  Hey.  Just mouth it.  Like, oh.  Freak the guy out.  It's kind of funny, but what a pussy.  Can you hear security? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, she can.  I backed it up.  Listen.  Don't take this picture.  The latch is scaring him.  I've made it so.  I don't give a crap.  I'm not here to fight.  You hear that?  What happened?  What did I miss?  No, I'm just, I'm about to hear.  The, uh, what did he say there?  What did I miss?  No, the, uh, why is everyone giving me hand signals and stuff?  What happened?  It sounded like he was alarmed.  If you listen really, if you listen really close, you can hear, uh, you can hear, uh,  come on, buddy, let's go. 
[02:39:00]  Listen.  Get some fat ass work!  Maybe so!  I don't give a crap!  I'm not here to fight!  Hey, do the clumps before you go, buddy.  Yeah, you egging me or you'd love me to punch.  Do something!  Hit somebody!  Do the clumps!  Sue your ass quick!  Yeah, you, and I bet you, you would!  Come on, do red flags!  What a dick!  He waited until security.  He waited, and now he's like, hit somebody, come on.  Yeah, I'll sue you.  I'll sue you.  I'll sue you!  I was injured by Ares.  That's making us white people look bad.  All of a sudden you throw the, I'll sue you?  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  I'll hit you with my foot foot.  Oh, yeah, you hit me.  He's talking about racking head, like Ares is going to come over there and punch him in  the face, and what does Whitey say?  My lawyer will call you!  I'll sue you.  I'm getting my attorney after you!  Oh, we stink.  Do something!  Hit somebody!  Get through the clumps!  Sue your ass quick!  Yeah, and I bet you, you would!  That's a friggin' little punk!  God, you come in here trashing people!  Oh, get out of here!  He's bad, man.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's, that, you're going to hear that? 
[02:40:00]  See, that's what...  He is, and he will punch you.  And they didn't say you're bad when he was there without security.  That's what I'm saying.  Now all the stuff comes out now that they know they're protected.  Yeah.  Wow, what a bunch of pussies.  He did call him a punk, right, as soon as security showed up.  Yeah.  He got tough talk.  Because the guy was going, can we talk now?  Yeah.  When he was actually there.  And then Ares was saying, why don't you talk tough like you were when I'm in the studio  now?  And they weren't.  Until security comes.  And then there, yeah, punk.  That's why I want to hear what they said when he left.  I want to hear his appearance of what they said when he left. 
[02:40:30]  Tough guy.  Punk.  He's bad, man.  Yeah.  Wow.  You're going to hear that on Excess Hollywood tonight.  He's not that big of a star.  What a jerk.  Excess Hollywood is not interested in that guy.  Christ almighty.  Unbelievable.  That was great.  Get him out of here.  He's going to whip some fat ass.  Yeah, he's going to whip some fat ass.  Then they go with the fake applause at these shows.  Yeah, they really came across like tough guys.  I wish there was a hidden camera as they were exiting the building by themselves to the parking 
[02:41:00]  lot.  They're all looking around, tiptoeing, like a burglar.  You know security was with them.  You know they had security with them.  They did not just play the fake applause thing.  Yes, they did.  Christ almighty.  Unbelievable.  That was great.  Get him out of here.  He's going to whip some fat ass.  Yeah, he's going to whip some fat ass.  Did you have our back Lamont or did you run?  The funny thing is, one of my best friends is black.  Of course.  Who helped walk him out?  I worked with a black woman in Raleigh for six, seven years, and she's like my best friend.  Jeez.  I love that.  Are they being serious? 
[02:41:30]  What does that mean?  That was classic.  Yeah.  That was the greatest five minutes of radio I ever heard in Natterman.  Yeah.  Wow.  You got the same show.  That's the same show that did Natterman that way.  These guys talk shit when you leave.  Yeah.  I'll say, look, say what you want about the Opie and Anthony radio program.  I'm going to single them out.  It's Opie.  It's awful to your face.  When you're in the studio, you get the crickets.  You get the fucking, the awful sound clips when he's right there. 
[02:42:00]  It doesn't happen when you leave.  It happens while you're in studio.  What are you talking about?  When you're awful to people, when you're awful to people, you're awful to them when they're  right here.  You'll throw something right in their face like a whole thing of poker chips.  Dude, the guy was doing the fucking thing.  You threw poker chips at him.  I fucking, dude, I didn't run and hide in another room and make phone calls.  Well, no, I did, but that was because it wouldn't have worked the other way.  And people are talking about the Bernie Getz thing.  I don't know.  I took that pretty far. 
[02:42:30]  Come on.  Dude, Bernie Getz shot four people.  Right.  He's not a black guy doing improv.  Hold on.  Kill four, shot four people.  A lot of people calling me out on this, though.  Mike, go ahead.  Hey, Opie.  What's happening?  Hey.  Hey, let's remember that you were the one that was hiding behind a desk when big, tall,  lanky, white Bernie Getz broke a CD.  No, dude, I got to jump in for sweet abs here.  What happened was Bernie, he didn't care when Bernie yelled at him.  When Bernie went out to his bag and then came back in, that's when he freaked out. 
[02:43:00]  Because Bernie went to his fucking bag.  And we weren't, we were wondering if Master Post searched the guy.  Actually, that was a real fear.  Like, he ran out.  I wasn't the only one.  Like, he got, he came back in and we didn't know what he had in his hand.  And that freaked us all out.  You're 100% right.  But we took that pretty damn far.  Uh, Chris from Phoenix has a great, uh, line.  He said, do the clumps before you go equals, now get your fucking shine box.  It's the same.  You know he wanted to kill him after that. 
[02:43:30]  Kill him.  Well, their little bit didn't make Access Hollywood.  It made, uh, local TV.  Uh, it did?  Yeah.  So let's take a listen to this and how it was reported down there.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Comedians?  Now a story you'll see, only on four.  A morning radio show, Squabble, that has South Florida talking.  CBS 4's Jason Wheeler.  Wow, we should be getting freaking coverage every day.  Yeah.  That wasn't that bad, was it?  We've had a lot worse.  Well, he is on a show for all.  He's been on it for a long time.  He did threaten to savagely beat the hosts.  Yeah, they probably did nothing. 
[02:44:00]  And it's a good one.  Oh, he was hot under the collar.  I'll say.  Now a story you'll see, only on four.  A morning radio show, Squabble, that has South Florida talking.  CBS 4's Jason Wheeler reports from Coconut Grove.  What?  Comedian Aerie Spears slated to perform tonight here at the Improv in Coconut Grove.  Sold out.  Dude, if that had to sell tickets.  Sold out.  In Coconut Grove.  No doubt the show will be different than his pre-show performances on local radio here in South Florida. 
[02:44:30]  Which have been no laughing matter at all.  No laughing matter.  Harry Spears.  Is this a fake thing?  He is here at the Improv.  Warning, warning.  Look out, angry Negro.  The guy is talking like a red, like Rock Quarry.  But I am Rock Quarry.  I'll tell Fred and Barney who I am.  They'll get a big kick out of it. 
[02:45:00]  What a buffoon.  Improv in Coconut Grove.  No doubt the show will be different than his pre-show performances on local radio here in South Florida.  Which have been no laughing matter at all.  We've got to get that clip.  No laughing matter.  No laughing matter.  No laughing matter at all.  Bitty, bitty, bitty, bitty.  Yeah, exactly.  He sounds like Tweaky.  Bitty, bitty, bitty, bitty.  No laughing matter at all.  Didn't you hate Tweaky?  I like them. 
[02:45:30]  Must sterilize.  Must sterilize.  Here in South Florida, which have been no laughing matter at all.  Perhaps comedian Aries Spears just wanted to be himself on the Paul and Young Ron morning show yesterday.  Apparently, he was not interested in showing off his repertoire of impersonations.  He started yelling at the interns in the hallway saying, you know, I'm not somebody's puppet.  You don't tell me what impersonations to do.  That was a little unnerving. 
[02:46:00]  Unable, they felt, to get any entertainment value out of Spears, the hosts dismissed their guest and then began to criticize his appearance on the show.  The comedian got wind of it, though, and returned to the studio and, with mics open, brought the house down with a tirade that made it abundantly clear that he was none too happy being the butt of the joke.  Be very careful what you say about people and how you say it.  Because I'm going to let you know something else about black people. 
[02:46:30]  When you talk like that to us and about us, you get your ass whipped.  So if you got something tough to say, say it now.  For guaranteeing, I'll whip you up.  We have tried unsuccessfully so far to get a hold of Aries Spears for direct comment.  He was, though, on another South Florida radio station this morning, responding to what happened yesterday.  We'll have that coming up later on today.  Oh!  In Coconut Grove, Jason Wheeler, CBS.  Oh, a dude skis!  That is the same one that did Natterman. 
[02:47:00]  That's why I got no respect for those guys.  They fucking do it when you leave the building.  All right.  Well, Paul and Young Ron from Miami, they will not be receiving a golden ticket from...  Really?  They should get a yellow one because they're cowards.  Fucko.  They're on the fucko list.  Yeah, cowards.  What pussies.  They did it to Natterman, too, and I remember Dan told me about it.  That's funny.  That's the same show.  I wonder if that was the same one that did Dane that way.  We still have four golden tickets to give away, and they will not be receiving one. 
[02:47:30]  What list are they on, Opie?  I don't know.  Maybe the fucko list, I guess.  My foot was going...  If we only have two lists, I guess they'd have to be on the fucko list.  My foot was going for a golden ticket, but now it's on the broko list.  What?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Was that supposed to be some kind of sick joke?  Here's what...  First of all, Fan gave me a polite laugh, which just acknowledged that the joke was over. 
[02:48:00]  I stared right at you.  I would know.  I didn't make eye contact with anyone.  That was childhood rape.  This would be a good point to take a break.  But wait, Opie, it was...  Because fucko and broko...  The Opie and Anthony auction continues.  Sound kind of close.  Go to opianthony.com.  61 items will be gone after today's program.  61 items are saying bye-bye.  We're going to take a break-o.  Eric is adding more items to the Opie and Anthony auction. 
[02:48:30]  Steak-o-eg-o.  You can check them all out by going to opianthony.com and clicking on the link.  Less than an hour left before the Opie and Anthony family guide pack goes away.  That was signed by Alex Borstein, who plays Lois.  Yes.  All right.  What?  We missed a real bomb when you were out there.  Did you hear it?  No, what happened?  Oh.  Oh, when we get back, we're going to have the audio of Jimmy hurting his foot.  Oh, goody.  It really hurts, man.  And in honor of that classic rock station in Miami, we're featuring new tracks from Stephen 
[02:49:00]  Lynch's new CD, Craig Machine, The Craig Machine.  Right.  Here's a song that is called...  I know, but all right, he'll find it.  A classic rock song we're going to play in honor of the Segetik Classic Rock Station.  And yeah.  So we'll play this as we go to break.  Stephen Lynch.  This is a classic rock tune.  It is so called because to me it sounds like a classic rock tune.  Get home late from work tonight. 
[02:49:30]  Baby, my body's aching.  I can't stop thinking about you and me and the love that we'll be making.  So I chill the champagne, light a candle too.  Baby, all the things that I do to you.  I love you so much, my little heart is breaking.  Let's make love. 
[02:50:00]  Baby, let's make love.  Your body fits me like a blow.  So baby, let's make love.  Oh, baby, let's make love.  Oh, yeah.  Baby, let's make love.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  There ain't nobody in the world in love as we are. 
[02:50:30]  But making love to you is like being inside a shooting star.  Now I'm in so deep.  Baby, we're grooving.  Love and the way your body's moving.  Then I pull it out just a little bit too far.  And I accidentally stick it in your butthole.  I put it in your butthole.  I swear that wasn't my goal. 
[02:51:00]  So put it all up in your booty.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And I swear.  I'll never do it again.  Unless you're kind of like that.  Like sand through the hourglass,  so is the O&A virus.  Hey, it's an autographed picture 
[02:51:30]  of the Mad Mexican and Chicago.  Oh.  Wow, we got to bring this back to New York.  It says best wishes O&A and Jim.  It says the Mad Mexican and then Chicago.  He's pointing to Chicago.  Oh, that's a little dog.  That dog is adorable.  Isn't it, Anthony?  Look at that.  What a cute dog.  Isn't that nice?  Aw, look at the little white face.  He's got like a little white face.  No, you didn't.  He's just crying.  Oh, B. 
[02:52:00]  He was wrong.  Oh, B.  That's wrong.  Oh.  Little white face.  Is he out there?  Oh, my God.  You know, even I, and I've been.  That costs money, too, for those pictures.  I've been with Opie on the air now for just about, like, ten years.  Ten years.  Even I didn't see that coming. 
[02:52:30]  I swear to you, I did not think you would do that.  Oh, my God.  He took the time to write Chicago with a little arrow.  With an arrow.  With an arrow.  He took his cute little dog.  You are a prick.  Oh.  You are a prick.  A little dog all happy.  Oh.  Can we get another one, please?  Please get another one.  Just tell him something happened.  We spilled coffee on it.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Tell him we spilled some Opie on it.  Yeah.  You are awful, man. 
[02:53:00]  The guy.  We'll get another one.  Oh, that makes me so happy.  Where do you get the other one?  You are really not right.  Yeah, we'll get another one.  Something happened.  Carlo, bring me a side picture.  Something happened to you.  That is more of a visual.  Yeah.  Because you just see everyone's faces just get really uncomfortable.  But that comes through audio very well.  That rip was pretty distinct.  People knew what was going on.  No one thought that was a newspaper. 
[02:53:30]  All right.  Well, Anthony.  Hey, this is a really nice picture.  Look at the dog.  All right.  I wonder what he's doing.  I knew it was a bad move.  As soon as I saw the picture, it turned sideways.  I'm like, yeah.  That ain't going to be right for a while.  Yeah, it turned sideways and it was over.  It is the cutest publicity shot ever.  It really is.  He's holding a little dog.  He's all proud and stuff with his Chicago hat or shirt on.  That's adorable.  Toby and Anthony.  The virus is spreading. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  We've got to get right back into the show today.  Someone's asking, what's with all the PSAs during commercials?  Well, we had to take an extended break that time to work out some technical issues to make the break longer.  We've punched in the PSAs, I guess.  Someone says, it makes it sound like you're broadcasting from some tiny little station at 4 a.m.  We might as well be the way shit is fixed.  Jimmy's still pissed off.  He injured his foot really badly. 
[02:54:30]  Very injured.  We're trying to find the audio so we can laugh at him again.  Because I really don't give a fuck.  We've got Bob Kelly in studio.  He just donated his cast that he wore after he broke his knee.  That's going up for auction in a few minutes.  It may even be up there already.  Also in studio, Anthony, Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez, starting up today doing their own program right after this fine show you're listening to right now.  Their first show here at XM.  Are you guys all staying for it?  You want to just stay on through? 
[02:55:00]  Just stay the whole way through?  Yeah, just stay through.  For the next few hours.  That's worth the rush hour traffic I'll hit going back to Long Island, sure.  No, all I have to say is good luck, bros.  Thank you very much.  I'm going to be listening to it.  Hey, if you guys want to stay, I've got that big, really long limo we were in on Friday to stay over.  Oh, you got that one from Friday?  The Super Stretch.  The 1988 Puerto Rican limo is here, everybody.  I almost started to think that we finally made it, but then I realized after the gig we really didn't make it.  Yeah, right. 
[02:55:30]  They only got the limo for the one way.  And now, Ron and Fez join Bruce Kelly, Nopi, and Anthony.  Hi.  How's it going?  Out of nowhere?  I thought we had to say...  We control when the Bruce Kelly, Ron and Fez interview starts.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  Wiki.  How you doing, Bruce?  Bruce?  Wiki.  Bruce?  Wiki!  Shock.  Bruce.  Somebody!  So he can't hear us at all? 
[02:56:00]  Talk to me!  Pull your pants down, you Fred Burtz-looking tool.  Well, we'll go back to...  Oh, 80s rocks.  ...and get this worked out.  Fucking amazing.  For the debut, eventually, Ron and Fez...  Quick!  Where's my Kasha Gugu?  That's how he gets out of his interview with Ron and Fez?  That's it?  That worked.  That was fine.  So he had to go back to his 80s music, I guess.  He's acting like he can't hear us.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  That's actually a great way to make a living.  It's just not working out, so you hit him with some double shots. 
[02:56:30]  Here we go, everybody.  Let's take a long look back at 1984.  Remember Duran Duran.  And then you sit back for four minutes.  Let's remember that trick for later on today.  In case things aren't working out, we're just on some 80s rock.  Well, let me explain what's going on.  Ron and Fez doing the big promotion push,  and they're going to be on with Bruce Kelly eventually on the 80s channel, right?  Is that what's happening?  That's what's supposed to happen.  They're going to be doing the same stuff that we were put through  when we first came on board here at XM.  You know, we were on all the stations, the 80s, the 70s, the 90s, the squiz. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, we did squiz the other day.  How was the squiz?  Rocking, and they get to curse, so that was really exciting.  It's easier that way, because now when you talk to Bruce on the 80s channel,  there's no cursing.  But when we were squiz, it's like, how the fuck are you guys?  Oh, man.  Just in your face, cursing.  Yeah.  I'm tired of the assholes around here.  Yeah, I'm going to punch the fucking boss, man.  All right.  Fuck it, rock. 
[02:57:30]  And then you go to the 70s channel, and it's like, they're high and everything.  Hey, everybody, it's a sunshine day.  Yeah.  It's great.  So true.  We had to do that.  Yeah.  We had to be reminded, oh, okay, we're doing the squiz.  You were the worst at it.  And then...  Bobby's cursing on XM Kids.  We're trying to do an interview.  He doesn't know.  I don't trade for nobody.  Yeah.  Have you been in the XM Kids studio yet?  Because we...  I have.  We trained in it.  Yeah.  And there's just, like, little dolls everywhere.  Yeah, it's all set up with little kid toys and everything. 
[02:58:00]  It's great.  It's hot.  They kicked me out because I dozed off with my face on one of the little seats.  Are we ready for British Kelly?  It's the same as it was.  Oh, we have this instead.  Much more important than talking to that fat slob.  Oh, it's Derek.  Derek has the Norton foot...  What's wrong, Jim?  Jesus.  What happened?  Bob's right here.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh.  Jack off.  Bob is svelte compared to Bruce Kelly. 
[02:58:30]  Is Bruce Kelly another XM?  He's a mess.  He's another guy?  You guys are just supposed to do an interview with him?  He's a mess.  You don't like him?  No, we kind of like him.  Why?  You call him a fat slob?  No, I like the guy.  He's a good guy.  I'd take a bullet for him.  He runs the 80s show.  He wears his pants a little high, but besides that, it's okay.  And he walks around with, like, sweats pulled up too high.  And he tries to be the self-appointed mayor of XM.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, he's the guy that'll be like, I'll let me tell you the deal about that guy right there.  Every company has one of these assholes that thinks, you know, he's going to let you know. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  He's going to let you know what the deal is.  Yeah, one guy at the office, he's the cool dude.  He's the one you can trust.  Bruce is the kind of...  They gave you the book on what you need.  You can throw that away.  You can throw that away.  Just give me a call.  He's the kind of guy that will lean into your office and go, everything okay?  And you'll look up uncomfortably and just ignore him and he'll go...  Every office has a bad asshole.  And they always give you the, where do you see her at the Christmas party?  Yeah.  All the gossip.  Oh, boy.  The stories.  All gossip goes to that one person, you know? 
[02:59:30]  He knows the right day to order the chicken in the lunchroom.  Of course.  Don't eat that.  Don't ever eat it on Friday.  No, no, no.  It's leftover chicken.  He knows all the ins and outs.  That's the guy who welcomed...  I think I know what you're talking about.  He welcomed you to...  Let me officially welcome you.  Yeah, yeah.  Because we weren't there until he did well.  I remember this jack-off.  As Burger Meister Meister Burger, let me welcome you.  The three months prior didn't count because he didn't officially do well.  I remember hearing this, I remember him sticking out right when he said that.  I liked it. 
[03:00:00]  I was like, what a jack-off.  What a jack, right?  So, we're waiting for the Bruce Kelly interview with Ron and Fez.  We're going to listen in on that.  But first, I guess Derek has the audio of Jimmy hurting his...  Just hurting his foot.  Just minutes ago.  Well, Ron and Fez really fast.  Could you show him the little booty?  Oh.  Jimmy has a real problem.  See, he's wearing the snowboarding boot today.  Sure.  And it's very bad, but it's been getting better, which is a good thing.  It's improving.  He goes to this doctor, taking care of him. 
[03:00:30]  And out of nowhere, this thing has fallen on his foot three times.  Two times.  Look under the thing.  It weighs 90 pounds.  And it comes from a fucking height.  It fell twice last week.  This big console board.  I asked him to fix it.  What else is new?  It wasn't done properly.  So, this morning, we're getting ready to do the Aries Spears bit, and my foot is out.  And it just falls, and my foot is throbbing now.  It hasn't hurt in a month.  I'm so aggravated.  This is no laughing matter.  Maybe they fixed it.  Maybe there's a ghost in the studio.  Maybe there's a dead she-mail hooker you killed once that's haunting the studio. 
[03:01:00]  Hunting the studio?  It's on Halloween.  Should be fixed.  There's plenty of chewed gum down there.  Just stick a piece of hubba bubba.  So, here's the audio of Jimmy hurting his foot about, I don't know, half hour ago.  No.  Oh, we're the home of Roger Roach.  Oh, no.  Right on my fucking foot!  That fucking thing fell again right on my fucking foot! 
[03:01:30]  This could be a problem.  I don't mean to lie.  I just love shit like this.  I can't tell you how many times last week I asked for this to be fixed, and it just fell  on my fucking bad foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot, and it just fell on it.  Don't laugh.  I'm talking about it.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  He has a foot thing on his foot. 
[03:02:00]  Why did that fall again?  Why did that fall again on my bad foot?  He's got one of those bad foot.  Dude, I got a boot on my foot because I have tendinitis, I have arthritis, and I have ligament  damage.  He's got old man's foot.  And right on my goddamn foot.  That's the third time that fucking thing has fucking fallen.  Third time.  Holy shit is that aggravating.  Anthony and Jimmy are very serious, and me and Bob can't stop laughing. 
[03:02:30]  It should not have fallen again.  Right on my foot.  Oh my god.  Holy shit.  I saw his face.  He just heard that freaking whack.  Scared the shit out of everybody, and then you look at this.  Did scare me, man.  That would look like a stress doll.  Somebody squeezed his gut, and then he just snapped.  I got a foot thing on my fucking foot. 
[03:03:00]  Look at his foot.  I got an arm thing on my foot.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing he has to wear.  Big foot thing.  I have enough problems.  He's going snowboarding after the show.  I'm trying to avoid surgery.  Yeah.  And I have stage four damage.  I have stage three damage.  I'm one inch from surgery.  And now you get stage four.  And I want to bite somebody's fucking face for that.  How did...  Wow.  It goes on from there.  You'll have to listen to the replay if you missed that earlier.  The best part, the initial screaming, and the foot thing on my foot. 
[03:03:30]  It's very funny.  So we're back alive now.  I have a foot thing on my foot.  You're all right, Jimmy.  Of course you do.  What else is fucking new?  Can you fix this?  No.  He's very angered.  What else is new?  Jimmy, it's not like feet don't get amputated.  I mean, things like this happen.  Yes.  And you might have to deal with it.  Long term.  It would actually be easier than asking for something to be fixed properly.  Look, just cut it off so it doesn't actually stretch far enough to be injured.  Holy shit.  Wow.  I don't know.  I just, you know, I do my job, you know. 
[03:04:00]  If I show up every day and fucking open my mouth and words don't come out, I'm fired.  So I'm not doing my job.  Right.  That's what it should be for everybody.  So if things have fallen down three times after you've asked to have it put up permanently?  I just don't comprehend how people aren't good at their jobs.  I don't get it.  Is that somebody's job to actually fix that?  I would assume.  Well, we don't get volunteers.  I mean, we don't just fucking hold a sign out.  Everybody got a screwdriver and somebody pulls over.  I think it's Habitat for Humanity. 
[03:04:30]  You're supposed to come in and put that up.  It'd be better.  What's the silly question?  Is that somebody's job?  What are they doing?  They're just placing it back up there?  I don't know.  Apparently they are.  They just put it back.  It'll be the fault of this thing.  Just as loose as it's been?  It won't be nobody's fault, of course.  It'll be a fault of the actual inanimate object.  I don't think it's supposed to.  It looks like it's supposed to be able to come out and go in.  It's not supposed to be screwed in.  Well, we've got to figure out something else.  All right, listen.  Do you have a spaghetti with a knack in at night, too? 
[03:05:00]  It's supposed to.  Is it going to stay in there?  I don't know.  He said it's not a sposter.  Well, that's the way I talk.  Are you talking about Anthony, huh?  Not at all.  I'm just interrupting.  Is Bruce Kelly ready?  We don't know.  What's going on with that?  Ben, you know anything?  Can we punch up the 80s station and see what it sounds like right now if he's talking?  No, that's way too complicated.  Girls on film.  That's way too complicated.  We don't know how to do that.  I don't know why.  I don't know why you limit your musical likes to exactly when you were in high school. 
[03:05:30]  Everybody acts like their senior year was the best music you've ever heard.  And you have to keep listening to it.  And you can't move on and try other things.  You don't do that with movies.  No one ever acts like, no, after the Poseidon Adventure, nothing really happened.  Nothing went on.  All the writers in our day were so much better.  No, but with music, you have a small window that you just hold on to and you want nothing else.  That's it for them.  Their prom theme is all they want to fucking hear. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  That's true.  I kind of want to hear like some Charlie Daniels.  That's it.  Devil went down to George.  Listen, kids.  You try to get your kids to listen.  Listen to this, kids.  This is when music was good.  I've called my kids in.  Harry Springsteen's on.  Come running in.  And they're just like, shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  Blows.  This just in.  Don working on linking with Bruce.  Technical problems.  Docking.  Let it go.  He's going to dock with him.  Seems we lost him.  Docking. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, my God.  We lost Bruce.  Well, we can get Steve back in here.  We have another bit of audio.  Speaking of other radio shows, Martini Steve is carrying a chair.  Why does he need a chair?  I don't know.  He's carrying a chair.  He's not tall enough.  Why are you carrying a chair?  You can't get Bobby a wireless mic.  The car is working.  Amazing.  The trunk's facing there.  Isn't it?  He's got a chair in there.  Right.  Ben, what's going on?  A little hybrid.  What's going on with the Bruce Kelly thing? 
[03:07:00]  Ben?  I'm trying to figure it out.  They didn't have any time to work on this because we only decided, I think, last week.  We wanted to do that, so there's really no time to fix it.  It's the third time this interview has been bumped.  Well, we tried to do this Friday, right?  Yeah, Friday and the day before, we were going to use that other little studio over there.  What?  What are you?  You know they talk with people on the space shuttle?  Yeah.  They actually talk with them in real time.  Oh, yeah.  The president can call up and give them their wake-up call.  Wake up.  Wake up.  And that mom from Queens.  Yeah.  The mother.  I worry about my boy up there. 
[03:07:30]  It's very dangerous.  She was a pisser.  The thing that kills me is when you were saying shuttle.  The shuttle!  Come down off of that shuttle.  You're going to get hurt.  Oh, just some Queens old mom.  Can we get Steve back on here now?  Where is Steve?  Bob's cast is now on eBay.  That's what you want to say?  Oh, wow.  That was fast.  You could bid on Bob Kelly's cast that he wore out.  Bid on my cast, man. 
[03:08:00]  All right.  Postal.  And it's signed by Dane Cook.  Yeah, put that.  We're selling a lot of comedy cities right now.  Yes, he is.  All right.  What do you got there, Steve?  Now, Steve, you'll have to share Mike's there for a minute.  Good news.  The Bob Kelly cast, autographed, it's up to a penny.  That'll increase, I think, tenfold.  Yeah, we'll get ten pennies.  Way to do the math.  Jesus.  That's the way I am.  I'm quick on the draw. 
[03:08:30]  Steve, what do you got here?  What is it?  The voicemail?  Yeah.  Is this good?  It's angry.  It's angry.  I guess I don't know much about the Boston sports DJs, but it's, I guess, John.  Ben would know.  Where's Ben?  Yeah, well, he was the one that told me to get it, but it's John Dennis yelling at,  leaving a nasty voicemail for this Ryan Russillo, who I guess was drunk and hitting on Dennis'  daughter the night before.  There's a sports radio war going on up in Boston with EI.  Buddy, Holly, glasses, Ben.  So, here's the audio.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:09:00]  Where'd you get those glasses from?  The Hubble Space Laboratory?  Two days left before Jim leaves.  Yeah, no, believe me, I'm anxious.  I think Ben's going to be the happiest, right?  Why?  I like you, Ben.  You don't like me?  I think Ben's going to be pretty happy when you're gone.  Why, Ben?  Why are you going to be happy?  All right, Ben, wait.  What's the deal, though, really?  There's two sports stations up there?  There's two sports stations, and these guys, Callahan is the guy that got suspended for  the monkey joke about the Metco students, remember that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  Metco students up in Boston.  And apparently, he left a very angry voicemail for his rival, Morning Host on the Zone. 
[03:09:30]  And the rival was hitting on this guy's daughter?  Yeah.  Where was that at?  It was that some part of the details are still, like, coming up.  How was his daughter?  Go with that one.  So, this guy just called up to hit this guy's voicemail.  Yes.  Shut the fuck up.  All right.  And we have the audio?  All right, here's the audio.  Hey, is this Rotillo, or Rotillo, or Rodillo, or Rosillo, or whoever your name is? 
[03:10:00]  All right, so right off the bat, he's going to make believe he doesn't know the guy's name.  I would have went with the dildo, Rodildo joke.  I like the Rodildo.  Is he all drunked up?  Huh?  Is he drunk?  Is that the gimmick?  He sounded a little slurry.  Yeah.  Probably, yeah, we get a couple of glasses of courage to make that call, I think.  Right.  Sure.  He's going to defend his daughter that was hit on by this guy that he's leaving a message  for.  John Dennis.  He's calling.  Rotillo.  Um, two points you need to understand.  Number one, I don't know who the fuck you are, or what it is you do. 
[03:10:30]  I guess you're on the zone, and I guess you're a radio wannabe.  Beyond that, I've never heard a word out of your mouth, out of who the hell you are, and  I don't even know what you do.  And I guess you're going around telling people, including Chachio, my producer, and my daughter  last night, that I shit on you and say, I don't know what you do, or I don't know what 
[03:11:00]  you're talking about.  You're quoting me by saying that.  Hey, brother, I don't know the first goddamn thing about you.  Isn't he?  Number two.  Hold on.  He said he's...  This guy was going around to his producer and his daughter saying that this guy shits  on him.  Says he doesn't know who he is or what he does.  It's exactly what he's done the whole time.  Didn't he hit on his daughter?  I hope that comes up, because if you get a call like this, then you have to fuck the  daughter.  You don't just hit on her.  Now you've got to make it your life's mission. 
[03:11:30]  How great would that be?  You were hitting on my daughter.  She's four.  I like that.  As angry as he is, he keeps the radio voice going.  Yeah.  Look here, asshole.  Sounds like he's doing it on his radio show, right?  You're over at The Zone, Boston's home of sports.  Classic sports.  You've got to throw the slug line in and everything.  Coming up next, I'll be talking about your...  Why don't you talk into him, Mike?  I know you're talking into cyberspace.  I really didn't even hear the thing. 
[03:12:00]  I'm listening to his fucking earlobes.  All right, here we go.  Why don't we go back to it?  Number two.  I'm wondering if you're still hungover, or were you so drunk?  And thrown up last night, that you even remember any of these conversations.  So let me tell you a couple things.  I don't know who the hell you are.  I don't give a shit who you are.  Eric Nagel?  Well, yeah, obviously gives a shit who he is, or he wouldn't be calling.  Eric Nagel.  Another drunk who might not remember what he did. 
[03:12:30]  I heard you were vomiting and cock blocking.  Was that true?  Who would argue with a machine?  Why would you even do this?  He's arguing with a machine.  It's insane.  He went into the wrestling promo for a second.  Let me tell you something.  Brother.  Yeah, I heard the brother thing.  Brother.  Next time you call my daughter a paycheck.  Yeah, that is a problem.  But I guess you're hitting on my daughter and telling her stuff that your dad, meaning me, is criticizing what it is you do for a living. 
[03:13:00]  I don't know the first goddamn thing about you.  Number two, you're a fucking drunk who's hitting on my daughter and saying, I want to be with you and create a scandal.  I'll tell you what, you want to create a scandal, why don't you, as like half my age, what are you, late 20s, I'm really 50s, you want to create a scandal?  Why don't you come and find me and I'll whip your fucking ears off and your nose off and I'll shove them up your ass and kick your balls up around your head. 
[03:13:30]  To replace your ears and nose.  Sounds like he's serious though, guys.  He did not have to tell his age.  Right.  He just had to give that insult and you know how old this guy is.  Let me tell you something, buster.  Listen up, bucko.  I'll rip your ears and your nose off and then your balls in your head.  Oh, God.  That's the radio professional in him.  He's still setting the table. 
[03:14:00]  I'm in my 50s.  You're half my age.  He wants to make sure it all gets out there.  Oh, you have to have sex with his daughter.  Yeah, you got to do it now.  Kobe Bryant just showed up at the Astrodome.  Is he homeless?  I heard there were rapes going on.  That's where I was going, Jimmy, you motherfucker.  That was going to be my only good one today and you went right for it.  You got the assist though.  You definitely got the assist.  You're Magic Johnson.  On this team, you're Magic Johnson.  There you go.  It was a big surprise at the Astrodome.  They just showed it on TV.  I'm just annoyed because I was bidding on the George Foreman grill, which I had Eric doing and I lost it. 
[03:14:30]  You lost?  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  No.  Yeah, that's gone now, man.  How much did it go for?  $1.50.  No, it didn't.  I don't know.  I like $200 or something like that.  Opie and Anthony, the Robert Kelly knee cast autographed by a bunch of people, including  most of the people in this room and Dane Cook and others, is up to $1,300.  Are you kidding?  Wow.  I swear to God.  Dude, it's one of the biggest bits on the XM show, so come on.  It's a famous cast. 
[03:15:00]  What moron would it pay $1,300?  $1,300?  Someone who wants to help people.  I'm kidding.  Help out the black people.  How did we get outbid on that?  You couldn't just set your thing to bid on it?  I'm glad I told my...  What happened?  Wait, get on a mic.  What was wrong with people?  There it comes.  The last five seconds, you had it won.  In the last five seconds, it said auction ended.  You were not the high bidder.  Somebody outbid at the last five seconds.  They do that proxy bid.  They roll it.  It goes back and forth.  So no matter...  Even if you put... 
[03:15:30]  No matter what anyone bids, bid $10 higher than that, they're doing the same thing.  So at some point, you're both topping each other, but when the time cuts out, it's whoever's  on top.  You wait to the last, literally, 30 seconds of the auction, and then you put your proxy  bid $100 more.  So it would just go back and forth, outbid you, and then he wins by a penny.  All right.  Yeah.  Sucks.  You get nothing, you lose.  Good day, sir.  I won a computer like that, and I didn't even want the fucking thing. 
[03:16:00]  I didn't think...  Someone told me how to do it, and I tried to...  You were just so psyched to win something?  Yeah, and then I...  But it actually worked, and I was like, shit, $800 for a mini computer from Taiwan.  Took nine months to get there.  Hey, six hours remaining on the inline skates.  A lot of these items are going away after today, so check out the auction on opianthony.com.  All right, so we're going to go back to the...  All right.  That's where we were.  The insult from the old man here to the young sports guy that works at The Zone.  What do you say?  I rip your ears off your nose, shove them up your ass, and then bring in Betsy, me, you, 
[03:16:30]  Betsy.  We'll drink, do some drugs, I'll fuck you.  Just get crazy.  We'll get Mark Parenteau.  No, Mark Parenteau.  Hey, little boy, we're going to get it.  All right.  Here we go.  You want to create a scandal?  I'll tell you what.  You want to create a scandal?  Why don't you, as like half my age, what are you, late 20s?  I'm really 50s.  You want to create a scandal?  Why don't you come and find me, and I'll rip your fucking ears off, and your nose off, 
[03:17:00]  and I'll shove them up your ass, and kick your balls up around your head?  That would create a scandal.  You want to be in the eye column?  You want to create a scandal?  You want to be something other than some jag off on The Zone?  Why don't you come see me face to face?  Give me 10 seconds.  Tell me, I'm Ryan Ritello, or whatever the fuck your name is.  I'll kick your balls up around your ass.  You can go to a hospital.  Then it will create a scandal. 
[03:17:30]  Do you remember any of this from last night?  Okay.  Do you remember any of this from last night?  Give me a call.  Go ahead and give me a call.  End of message.  Delete.  Press.  But if you're pissed off that this guy was doing this with your daughter,  wouldn't you go find him?  Or his machine.  You'd be so mad that you're just going to sit there waiting for him to knock on your front door?  Well, you know, a psychologist would enjoy this whole thing  because he's supposed to feel aggressive towards another man. 
[03:18:00]  What's he bringing up?  Asshole.  Balls.  Jack off.  It's all coming across a little drunk and a little sexual at the same time.  Yeah, yes.  It's like a prison fight.  I'll kick your balls by your ass.  And that's like threatening.  I'll punch your nose right into the middle of your face.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Good job, God.  I'll fucking knock your fucking ears right in the side of your head.  I swear to God.  You know, it's God.  Why did I just do the same joke twice?  I bombed the same time. 
[03:18:30]  What are you having, Jim?  Your foot.  Your foot's in pain.  Why did I think that would fool anyone?  Not only did I do it twice, I stole the concept from Anthony  because he's the one that pointed out, asshole and balls are together.  That's okay.  We both use our own inspiration from each other.  I stole it, and then I stole it twice, and the second time people are like,  enough.  You wonder why stuff falls on your foot.  Wow.  Thanks, Bob.  Way to bend me out.  Oh, goodness, Bob.  I feel like a stupid crooner over here with this microphone.  It had to be you. 
[03:19:00]  Hey, Obey, good to see you.  None of us.  Welcome to the show.  It had to be you.  It's a nice show.  It's a great show in here.  The only guy that has to hold his mic.  Very intimate in here.  It's nice.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  What I was going to say, though, is that guy just feels old.  He probably feels very old at that point.  There's a young guy from the other station, and he's there wheeling in on his daughter.  That's got to make him feel bad.  So now he's got to tell him a little something. 
[03:19:30]  And it didn't seem like the daughter was offended or spit in the guy's face.  She was aroused.  There was something happening there.  Yeah, yeah.  This wasn't like, my daughter is, you know, not interested.  Right.  Her little body was telling her things she had never heard before.  I wonder if she was crying while he's making the phone call.  Please don't call him, Daddy.  Daddy!  My daughter left a slug trail in her diapers.  See, I don't think he would say that.  I love that one.  Slug trail.  Guys, an email went out to everyone at XM Radio Programming. 
[03:20:00]  Uh-oh.  And the email says, Ron and Fez are moments away from hitting the air on XM 202.  Moments.  Moments away.  Their show airs live on high voltage from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. right after the Opie and  Anthony Program.  So other channels will probably be talking about you guys.  You guys look excited.  Yeah, we are.  You look like you're thrilled to be back on the air.  Dude, you should see the staff they got.  Well, we haven't got one of our interns back from Anthony yet. 
[03:20:30]  So we're still waiting to see what happens.  We're missing him.  Have fun with that guy, Paul.  Have fun with him.  I only met him the other night when my new intern came over and got an autograph from  me and a picture.  Oh, that's a good sign right there.  All the stuff he had, he couldn't carry it all.  He had a t-shirt, a baseball, 8x10 glossies.  Oh, my goodness.  You guys got a crack staff.  Not that they're good.  That's what they smoke.  Well, don't boom.  Fuck me.  They're all in the van waiting to go to the Yankees game.  I'm going to punch their noses to their faces. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, we got 66% of your staff in here right now.  Oh, yeah.  There they are.  The bottom 66%.  Yeah.  Look at them right now.  First show, both of them.  Look at their eyes.  Four sides white.  They're just...  Oh, yeah.  They are just panicking on you.  Yeah.  Earl's got the Feet's Don't Fail Me Now look that we always love.  He's waiting.  Halfway through the show, you're just going to see the silhouette of Earl through the doorway  where he busts through to get out.  He's got the eyes of the old-time train purser that just found the dead body in the baggage 
[03:21:30]  compartment.  Yeah.  Earl?  Oh, the conductor.  Yeah.  He's the conductor.  Which would be a great look for you.  Come on over, Earl.  Come on, Earl.  The scat man didn't look as nervous when he was communicating with Danny from his place  in Miami.  Executive producer of the Ron and Fez show.  Hello, everybody.  Boy, does that sound scary when you say it like that.  Yeah.  That's why I said it here, Fezzy.  And make-out artist.  Did you see him?  He was making out with a chick the other night.  Chicks.  Then he holds up the thing so no one can see it. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  At least he was making out with one of his own.  Earl?  A guy?  What, a dullard?  Oh.  It looks like Denzel's stunt double.  Earl, what do you got planned?  Earl, it's the first show.  Come on.  The kickoff of the Ron and Fez show on XM Satellite Radio 202.  Earl, what do you got planned for the show today?  The usual.  The usual.  There isn't a usual because it's the first show.  The first show on a brand new medium here. 
[03:22:30]  It's not the usual.  It's the usual.  The usual.  Can't even really do the usual tomorrow.  That's the only word you can't use.  It's the first show.  There is no usual.  It's like a year before you can start doing the usual.  We come in here on a daily basis.  We do the usual.  No, we're weeks away from finally doing the usual.  Oh, well, what have we been doing?  What is the usual, Earl?  Maybe we're misunderstanding.  What is the usual?  All right.  Let's go a little deeper.  This is a Deep Tracks interview.  Let's go.  Well, the first couple of shows, it's going to be Ron and Fez. 
[03:23:00]  That's what they wanted.  Riffing, I guess.  It's just Ron and Fez.  Go ahead, guys.  Keep talking.  I don't remember saying I wanted that.  Okay.  What kind of bit ideas do you have?  Some bit ideas?  Yeah, we're writing a couple of things.  Oh.  That's no.  That is no.  We're writing a couple of things.  What are you writing, Earl?  Well, Harry, you have a full...  You have a full...  I like that.  He has just delegated responsibility.  He's going to work in perfectly with this XM.  That's exactly what you did.  Harry, what do you got? 
[03:23:30]  That's what we hear all the time from XM.  This is such a great...  Half the buck.  It's such a great thing because Earl's in charge of Harry and now blacks are above the Arabs.  Yeah.  I'm not an Arab.  The only time I have to explain that.  As time moves on, the blacks are moving up.  Where are you from?  I'm half Ecuadorian and half Armenian.  Oh.  You're not Arabs.  We're Christians.  Yeah, but that makes Arab.  How does that make Arab?  I don't know.  It's a chemical reaction.  It's because you have gray skin.  You're an Arab.  You're an Arab.  We go with the look.  You have black little bags under your eyes. 
[03:24:00]  You're an Arab.  Arabian.  They killed my ancestors.  You're shaved.  You have a five o'clock shadow.  You're an Arab.  Everybody's ancestors were killed at one time.  By someone.  Enough.  That's a good point.  Thank you.  Most of the time for your people.  That's right.  People are Christians.  You look Arab.  You are not Arab.  How come yesterday on 9-11 you were walking around with a slight smile on your face?  And a party hat.  Yeah.  I heard you're in the bathroom.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right, Earl.  I heard a noisemaker when I came in.  Why do you look like your parents' names are Herman and Lily? 
[03:24:30]  Wow.  Let's get to the answer to the question.  Eddie.  Eddie.  You should see a beautiful cousin.  What are you guys writing?  Earl has passed a buck to Harry.  Harry?  There are some bits that have been written that we're going to get produced for this week.  Who wrote them?  Fez wrote them.  Thank you very much.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  And yeah.  Harry made the copies, though.  Right.  Oh, my God.  And they haven't been done yet.  And this is the day of the show.  We're 30 minutes away.  Yeah.  Earl, you said we're writing some things. 
[03:25:00]  That's weird.  We literally, but.  He means humanity.  When he says we.  Right.  He means mankind.  The collective we.  I understand.  Like when we all said we landed on the moon.  Right.  I wasn't there.  But wait, wait.  So what do you personally have?  Like, what have you lined up?  I'm sure you've done some stuff.  We already have a line on our first two guests.  Who are they?  A line on.  A line on.  There's some nibbles out there for a possible guest.  All right.  Two guests.  What guests?  And names?  One is a big name. 
[03:25:30]  Or fairly big name.  Well, why won't you say?  What are you wearing?  This would be the point where.  Oh, now you're going to swipe them away from you?  Exactly.  This would be the point where you tell everyone the big name.  Because quite frankly, we have a big show so we can promote for Ron and Fest.  What's the big name?  It's the Pope.  And we're just leaving it down.  Wow, that's big.  We've got to call into the church.  It's the old one that died.  What's the big name, Earl?  We're working on Matthew Modine.  Talking about the new book he wrote about Full Metal Jacket.  All right.  That's good.  Matthew Modine.  Wait a minute.  What year is this?  Is it 87? 
[03:26:00]  Because if it is, this is a gigantic interview.  Get Bruce Kelly back on.  So is this going to happen?  They're very excited and they want to put together.  Who's excited, Earl?  The publishers are excited.  Uh-huh.  And they're coordinating the schedule.  All right.  That's our demographic, publishers.  We have Jack from Jack and the Beanstalk is coming on the show.  The publisher is actually excited because a radio station called and said, I want to talk to Matthew Modine.  They're all going, yes, I knew it. 
[03:26:30]  We've been waiting for this moment.  Can I put you on the show?  Stop the presses.  Stop the presses.  Sit down, Ross.  Earl Douglas returned our call.  They're excited.  They're excited.  What the fuck are they looking for, Earl?  Give us more.  Let's go inside.  No, and Ron, you sent me an email last night about an author you wanted to get on.  Right.  So did you get him?  I'm waiting for a confirmation.  So that's Ron's work.  All right.  Well, that's two good things to look forward to, guys. 
[03:27:00]  My guy had to be bumped for Matthew Modine.  I'm sorry.  So what, and the way the guest will read Ron's email aloud.  But why didn't the publisher say yes at this point?  What are they waiting for?  They've got to coordinate Matthew Modine's schedule because he's filming as an actor.  What's he filming?  Jack and the Beanstalk 2?  Right.  First, they've got to wait for the excitement to just settle down.  I hear Chunk from Goonies is going to be phoning in also, right?  He's actually an entertainment lawyer.  He just did a deal for me. 
[03:27:30]  Are you shitting me?  I'm not kidding you.  It's no surprise you have a lawyer named Chunk.  Wow.  Really threw that softball up, didn't I?  One foot.  All right, well.  Things are happening.  Things are happening.  Things are happening.  This Arab seems a little mad.  Are you all right, Bill?  What is it?  I'm fine.  I've got nothing to add to Earl's guest list.  All right.  Well, what do you got to add?  Real quick.  It's your show, too.  What do you got to add?  What do you personally have for the show, Harry? 
[03:28:00]  Trying to get Amy Poehler from SNL.  You're going to have to do something, even if it's issuing a fatwa.  Something.  What exactly does that mean?  I think it's a curse.  Fatwa is a death sentence.  A death threat?  I don't know.  I'm not Arab.  Yeah.  It's like some kind of holy war thing.  Yeah.  It's like an ode to God that we are going to kill all these people.  That's right, right?  Yeah, that's about right, then.  Don't do that, Harry.  Look in your wallet on your manual.  Why does your belt buckle say jihad? 
[03:28:30]  You ain't fooling anyone.  How do you have a box cutter as a key chain?  Now, you see our crack staff in there.  This is what they do on a daily basis.  You have now been elevated to that position for the Ron and Fez show.  So, it's a lot of responsibility.  Yeah.  I mean, I've been doing a lot of stuff getting all the prep sheets together.  Not an intern anymore.  No, I know.  It's a big step up.  Wait a minute.  Who does the prep?  Fez.  Well, Fez does one.  We're also doing one of our own.  That won't get on the air. 
[03:29:00]  That you and Earl can do it back there while you're waiting for Matthew Modine's people  to call you.  And you know what?  I was thinking Matthew McConaughey when he was saying it.  I'm thinking his career isn't hot anymore.  But then Matthew Modine, that's going way back.  That's even worse, right?  All right, well.  It's like hearing Tony Curtis on Line 9.  Sounds like there's a lot going on on the show.  My movie's Spartacus.  It actually wasn't bad.  It wasn't a bad impression.  Thank you. 
[03:29:30]  It'll be a little different now, though.  No, that's not you idiot.  Oh, the other guy.  Oh, the gay one.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  That's the other guy.  That's the guy who is...  That's Douglas.  Sorry, Mike Douglas.  How are you doing?  That's Mike's father.  Bob Kelly, how are you doing?  He said Mike Douglas.  That's Mike Douglas.  The guy was on the variety show.  Hey, yo, how are you doing?  I'm Spartacus.  I'm holding a microphone.  Oh, wow.  If it wasn't Merv Griffin, the movie would have been called Cocktacus.  Boy, I was running downhill with a heavy package. 
[03:30:00]  All right, Earl.  We're all going to be in the back office listening to the first Ron Affeck show.  Listening in.  That's where Earl will be.  He'll be back there in a corner going, no.  No.  Oh, just making stuff.  So what bits are you working on?  Ah, Harry, you have that folder.  Harry, that folder.  Harry, what are you guys working on?  Well, we're getting some prep sheets together.  Yeah.  How many folders do you guys have for the Ron Affeck show?  Ten folders.  At least.  At least ten. 
[03:30:30]  Maybe.  All empty.  Yes.  I hate to put our guys on the spot, but Nathaniel, just in general, anything, what are you working  on for the show?  Geez.  That's a tough one.  Is it?  No.  I mean, I'm pulling a, yes.  I'm always working on the bombs and flubs, plus I'm developing the not listening segment  that opens.  Uh-huh.  See, that's, okay, there's something for the show.  I'm sure any of the guys in there, you see them working every day trying to pull sound  clips and news stories.  Guys.  I get emails from Travis that I don't understand. 
[03:31:00]  Guys, let's be honest.  We don't need any of these people around us.  We're just very lonely people.  Is it that we're lonely?  We just like having people around when we do this shit.  No, they all do stuff.  Fan works on stuff, and then Travis is home painting a safe zone sign that he can stand  next to.  Danger.  Falling concepts.  Hey, we got some info on your eBay thing, Jimmy.  Let's say hi to Jamie in Tennessee.  Jamie. 
[03:31:30]  What's up, boys?  Got a little information on this whole getting out bid thing on eBay.  All right.  There's a website called Bidnapper.  What you do is you pretty much subscribe to it for the hardcore eBayers, and say you bid  something on $10, put a max bid of $20.  Somebody on Bidnapper can put $11 in, and at the last second, it'll bid $11, and that  person will win, because it's quicker than the eBay servers.  What if, like, 12 guys are using Bidnapper, and they all battle against each other? 
[03:32:00]  Well, there are a few people that know about Bidnapper, plus you have to subscribe to it.  They pull directly out of your bank account like that.  So I've used it before, but, you know, it's kind of weird having somebody that's got access  to your bank account.  Sure.  You just met online, and now they can pull whatever they want out of your bank account.  Well, that sounds like a real safe thing.  I've given Bidnapper power of attorney.  Power of attorney over all my finances.  They're sending some money off to Nigeria, because I've won $10 million, and I have to 
[03:32:30]  give them my account number.  My lawyer, Chunk, will hear about this.  I swear to God.  He's an entertainment lawyer.  Who's your accountant, sloth?  Well, before we let her all go prepare for the run of the show...  Well, sorry, I'm trying to interrupt you, but I hurt my foot.  Can your Dr. Doogie Howser call me?  Earl, are you going to give the guys a pep talk before their first show?  Before their first national show?  Yeah.  Yeah?  There's going to be a pep talk?  You can do it now.  We'd like to hear it. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, let's do it now.  Go ahead.  Are you going to be one of those guys that's going to lead us in prayer, like the guys backstage?  Earl, take the mic, because we're only 15 minutes away.  This is about the time you should give a pep talk.  Let's get the pep talk.  Let's get going here.  You want everyone in here?  Yeah, let's get some people in here to get the pep talk.  I agree.  Pep everybody up.  Get them in.  Let's get the whole Ron and Fez team in here.  Where's Harry?  Where's Paul the intern?  Our interns didn't start today for some reason.  All right, guys.  Everyone is coming into the studio for Black Earl's pep talk. 
[03:33:30]  The executive producer of the Ron and Fez show.  They're starting up in 15 minutes.  Where's Harry?  Harry?  Hey, do you have an intro for the show?  He's not busy.  Harry's making a map of the stairwell.  He's ready to go.  Later, son of a bitch.  Here's Earl halfway through the show.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  He doesn't know anything about birth and no radio shows.  All right, Earl.  We're all standing by for the pep talk.  Is it a prayer or a pep talk? 
[03:34:00]  What is it?  More of a pep talk.  Okay.  All right.  Let's listen.  All right.  Earl?  No one talk.  Give them the floor here.  Go ahead, Earl.  We should have some of that music.  Oh, yeah.  Like the old-time football music.  We need some Newt Rock me music.  Yeah, yeah.  His is more of an Eddie Robinson grambling.  He's going.  How about the theme from Shaft?  Or Taps.  That Earl is one bad mother.  Shut your mouth.  Shut your mouth.  He's just talking about Earl.  I can dig it.  Derek's good.  Derek's good in the other room. 
[03:34:30]  Let's see what he finds.  We need some music behind Earl.  Oh, my God.  Guys.  Just old-school hip-hop would work for him.  Yeah.  This is going to be the same pep talk the guy that jumped from the top of the Superdome got.  This will be okay.  All right.  I got some if you don't have some.  Oh, you do?  Yes.  All right, everyone.  It's Black Earl with the pep talk for Ron and Fez, who start up in moments. 
[03:35:00]  I'm not going to say anything to tap.  Doesn't work for you?  No.  Then could you tap?  Oh, I can't.  How about a little soft shoe?  I got some sand in my bucket.  This is going to be a stillborn radio show.  And it will actually come out blue.  That's where we'll be.  They're not getting oxygen.  We can't get the baby show to breathe.  Lordy, Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying. 
[03:35:30]  All right.  We got better music.  Derek Scott's got some.  Here's his music.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Produce the show, dummy.  Derek Scott's got some inspirational music for Black Earl.  Go.  All right, Earl.  Let's go.  You don't have to hear it.  You don't need it.  Just make a speech.  Well, speaking entirely for myself, I'm looking forward to this.  It's very rare in radio that you get a second chance and on a national scale. 
[03:36:00]  And we're going to do this.  This will be a successful show.  And this will be.  It's going to be a hit.  We're going to have an enormous, enormous hit.  I'm fighting for words.  Come on, Earl.  You're doing good so far, buddy.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.  All right, Earl.  Let's go.  I'm really excited about it.  I hope everyone else is as excited as I am.  We're taking for nothing. 
[03:36:30]  And let's rock and roll.  Let's do it.  Not exactly I have a dream, is it?  It makes me want to commit suicide.  You just made me want to quit.  Jesus.  I am not a public speaker of any type.  I'm not a computer.  You're not a living organism.  Wow.  And that drew him into radio.  I really don't like speaking much.  Yeah.  I think I'll pick a career in radio. 
[03:37:00]  I'm not, like, speaking in front of enormous crowds or anything.  Right.  There's a reason why I'm in radio.  What, do you want to do a ham show in a closet by yourself?  No.  Your body posture stinks, too.  It does.  You just keep looking down.  Your arms are like MS.  You're just flailing.  Seriously, if you didn't know, if we took a picture of you and said,  what's the body posture, everybody would say failure.  That you just found out some horrible news.  And even though you do know, you say that.  Or lost a quarter.  Something.  We're going to do good. 
[03:37:30]  Let's go to Dave in Tennessee.  Dave.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Morning.  Hey, how come the New Orleans Police Department has more composure than Ron and Fez's new staff?  Well, they're together more, right?  Right.  I got to say, Earl has just no pressure-handling skills at all.  You don't.  That remains to be seen.  No, it doesn't.  You make Big Andrew look like fucking Mariano Rivera.  Honestly, the show hasn't launched yet.  The show hasn't launched yet. 
[03:38:00]  We don't even know.  Earl, you've got to be a new Earl.  It's launched yet.  It's on the pad.  The gantry has pulled away.  That's right.  It's already smoking, buddy.  What are you talking about?  I mean, like we haven't done our first official show.  Can I say something?  I hope he scares me with every line he says.  I don't know this guy, but you guys are really pushing him right now.  Because we want a new Earl.  But he looks like he just switched, like a little thing.  Yes, he does switch.  Does that happen with this guy?  That happens.  Because I just saw something change in his whole demeanor.  He looks like he's...  He'll be all right.  Earl, we want a new Earl. 
[03:38:30]  That's right.  The old Earl is dead.  You are in charge.  You are the executive producer now.  You're not that Earl that just hangs pictures.  Right.  You're not the public file guy anymore.  You're Earl, the new guy.  That's right.  You've got to fight back.  When these guys are smashing you, you've got to fight back.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  What?  The one lesson I've definitely learned is never to try to riff with comedians.  You'll get crushed.  It's not about that.  You've got to fight back, though.  Fight back.  Don't take their...  Protect yourself.  Protect your territory.  That's right.  You're the producer. 
[03:39:00]  You're the producer of the Ron and Fez show.  It's your job.  And that has not been lost on me.  You're the guy that has publishers excited that Matthew Modine may or may not.  They're excited.  They're excited in an interview.  You're the guy we didn't want, but we got you another opportunity.  That's right.  After they picked eight guys, their ninth guy to give to us was you.  Exactly.  You're nice, baby.  Look at their staff and then line up behind them.  Earl gave us a good six years of dedication, and I don't know.  I think Derek's been with us four months. 
[03:39:30]  What?  You don't think getting left behind is a motivator?  Yeah, it's true.  That's right.  You were left behind.  Although, during this conversation, I noticed Wiki's going through his Rolodex looking for  other names.  Who else has been fired from a morning show?  Who can I call?  Come on, Earl.  We want to see the new Earl.  I'm dead serious.  This isn't even a bit anymore.  Believe me in three months.  The old Earl is dead.  There's going to be a lateral move you make to intern.  FEMA.  That's exactly what the guy from FEMA was doing. 
[03:40:00]  I'm waiting for a call right now.  About food.  This guy's got the file here.  Harry?  Harry, where's Harry?  I'm going to let Harry address that question.  They step back, and the other guy goes to the podium.  Well, the president's working on the prep sheets.  Right.  Good news.  We're going to get the Red Cross involved.  They're excited about it.  Right.  We're piling our listeners up in the Astrodome.  Yes, the dead are the lucky ones.  All right.  How much time do we have left in our show? 
[03:40:30]  Well, after hearing Earl's speech, I just want to say to you guys, good luck, bro.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah, Earl.  Nice meeting you, dude.  I met you once before, yeah, but I'm glad you got a job.  You seem really...  He had a big party, too, when he left Denny W.  Oh, how'd that go?  How was your party, Earl?  The party was cool.  What did they give you after 16 years of service?  Mellon.  Not a goddamn thing.  He got nothing, right?  Nothing.  No parting gift?  Those motherfuckers.  Isn't that amazing?  No gold watch?  The guy fucking slumps around for 16 years. 
[03:41:00]  He should have given you slippers.  Maybe a pillow.  There was a big sign they had over his cake that said, the black guy finally quit.  That's how well they know him after 16 years.  Beat it.  Jesus.  I didn't say a word.  They didn't give you anything, seriously?  No.  I didn't.  I didn't spend it.  They gave him a plaque that's still waiting to be hung.  What did they give you?  They threw a party.  What was at the party?  16 years.  What are they?  Like a typical luncheon, lots of food, cake. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  They didn't give you nothing like a spinning belt buckle, anything?  They had a watch for him, but he can't tell time.  He can't read the watch.  Wow.  Excuse me, sir.  Did you read to my wrist?  I never had shoes before.  Would Sandy Duncan take you up to her room and teach you to read?  No.  It's a book.  All right.  My friend got us cold bills on a hot day on the roof.  Well, Earl, get back to work. 
[03:42:00]  You got like, you got six minutes there.  To finish writing your bits.  That's right.  They let him out at AEW and he almost hung himself.  It was basically that.  What do you mean get back to work?  How about get to work for the first time, quickly?  Now, I'd like to be able to say Earl produced that show and did a good job, but I'm sorry I  can't say that.  It just didn't happen.  You know who he is?  He's Frank McRae.  Anybody know who Frank McRae is?  No.  All right.  No.  Baseball?  No. 
[03:42:30]  It was an actor.  Oh, is that it?  We're done?  Yeah, we're done.  We've been done for 40 minutes.  Well, make sure you go to the Stress Factory and see me this week.  Oh, there you go.  Not this week.  And actually, the 22nd to the 24th.  Well, maybe if you came in here and did some of your material, we would plug it, but you  did nothing.  You guys ever talk baby talk?  Ha-ha, you should have, you pussy.  Marshmallows.  Stress Factory, the 22nd to the 24th in News Brunswick.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  That's it.  A couple things from us. 
[03:43:00]  Jimmy's last day tomorrow.  Not last day, but you're going to L.A. on Wednesday, right?  Yeah, for six months.  Wow.  No, I'm just kidding.  Oh, Jesus.  Jimmy will be coming and going.  No, he's not leaving.  He's just going out to L.A. to do the HBO thing, but tomorrow's your last show for a while.  You'll be doing phone calls and stuff.  Yeah.  I'm sure I'll call you from the hospital and have my fucking foot fixed.  Oh, boy.  We'll have more planned for you than Earl got after 16 years of service.  I'm not leaving.  I don't need anything planned for me.  Yeah, just a little, you know, going away little thing, maybe.  Maybe Ben can let me look at those fucking clear toboggans he wears on his face. 
[03:43:30]  And the Opie and Anthony auction continues.  Go to opianthony.com.  A lot of items going away today.  A lot.  I think 61 items will be gone after today.  The skates.  My skates are up to $4,800.  There's six hours left in them.  That's it.  But a bunch of stuff going away.  Every, like, ten minutes, another item is gone.  So you might want to go there if you bid on a certain item, okay?  Opianthony.com.  Yes.  When you hear the starting gun fire now, make sure all ONA staff run out of the studio. 
[03:44:00]  How is this changeover?  What do we got?  Eight seconds?  It's going to be like, yeah, it's like NASCAR.  We planned a nice long opening.  Oh, is that it?  Very smart.  Very smart.  Earl's going to be reading the Bible.  If your staff could just prop up our staff in here on the way out, we'd appreciate it.  All right.  Well, Ron and Fez, good luck to you guys.  Thanks, buddy.  Great to have you.  Thanks for the party, Friday.  On board.  All kidding aside, these guys are going to kick ass.  You're going to love them.  Absolutely love them. 
[03:44:30]  So they start up in just a few minutes.  Stay here.  That's it.  Party is over.  Everybody go home.  That's the Speak for the BFM News Show. </pre>
