<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, primarily centered around the 2004 Bush-Kerry presidential election, but veering wildly into unrelated tangents.  The show began with Opie and Anthony prematurely declaring George W. Bush the winner of the election, launching into highly offensive mockery of John Kerry and Teresa Heinz Kerry, filled with profane language and speculation about Heinz Kerry’s drug use and attractiveness.  This segment included an eBay auction for an Oompa Loompa t-shirt ending with the winner refusing to pay, and listener calls further escalating into racist and offensive discussions.  A clip from *Team America: World Police* was played, reinforcing the show's aggressive and nationalistic tone.  The recurring character Stalker Patty and her efforts to help Lady Di find employment were discussed.  The hosts also initiated a "chick flick" challenge based on Oprah's 50 greatest chick flicks, and Steve C.’s shaved head after a haircut mishap became another source of jokes.  Discussions of *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* and a caller's superstition linking the Washington Redskins' performance to presidential elections added to the chaotic mix.

The next segment opened with a discussion of one of the hosts' recent head shaving experiences,  including a story about a coworker, “Black Earl,” accidentally shaving a Hitler mustache.  This transitioned to photoshopping and the hosts’ physical appearances.  A significant portion featured truckers calling in with crude, sexually suggestive rhyming poems about their lives on the road.  The election was revisited with a comedic audio piece satirizing a Tom Brokaw interview with President Bush, adding fabricated details about watching chick flicks and alien anal probes.  The hosts consistently mispronounced words, notably those with the letter “L,” frequently mishearing "tax cuts" as "tax cunts."  Interns prank-calling people waiting for the *Regis and Kelly* show, making offensive comments about their appearance, with a memorable interaction involving a woman deemed the "fattest, ugliest" person in line, further fueled the offensive tone. The discussion about Oprah's top 50 chick flicks reappeared, setting up another bet between the hosts.

A series of phone calls dominated the following segment.  A Bush voter explained her decision, followed by calls with Lady Di (described as hungover and unemployed) and her friends, discussing their drinking, job search (aided by Stalker Patty), and Lady Di’s appearance.  Humorous Tony Danza impersonations were used for prank calls.  A call with someone collecting a debt from a doctor who performed a questionable prostate exam was also included.  Discussion of a previous broadcast featuring Taylor Law and Mia engaging in explicit acts led to a call with Taylor, who criticized Raquel, prompting a brief heated exchange between them.  The feud continued into the closing moments along with more off-color jokes.

The next segment started with Julie's bizarre petting zoo story, describing a midget riding a midget horse dressed as a clown, presented as an "Ozone midget sighting."  A heated, vulgar exchange occurred between a caller, Jeff from Connecticut, and Jimmy Norton, filled with insults targeting each other's mothers and graphic sexual descriptions.  A caller predicted Norton’s bad day, followed by an angry, profane rant from John from Iowa about Chicago.  An interview with intern Danny and a homeless guitarist, Jesse, in Central Park ensued.  Jesse surprisingly declared his support for George W. Bush and performed a poorly received song.  The segment then returned to the Oprah's 50 greatest chick flicks game, with guests Steve and Ben joining the hosts.  The discussion was filled with crude comments, arguments over movie plots, and differing definitions of "seeing" a movie.

The final segment focused on the chick flick game with guest Jimmy.  The hosts read synopses of films like *The English Patient* and *Titanic*, making crude and sexually suggestive comments.  Discussions and disagreements over what constituted a "chick flick" were prevalent, along with speculation about everyone's sexual preferences.  Listener calls continued, featuring crude humor and sexually explicit content.  One caller repeatedly used a possibly offensive name, Kampson. Segments about a planned road trip with a listener and a Tony Danza prank were also included. The show closed with the hosts' usual outro, including a humorous song about AIDS, and promotional material.

[00:06:00]  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Is that an endorsement, Anthony?  No.  Oh, all right.  Just Jesse Jackson.  You scared me there.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole?  You keep your hands off of my mule.  That's right. 
[00:06:30]  He was banging cocktail wageses two at a time.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk Mick friend.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Ridiculous!  Ridiculous!  Ridiculous!  Ridiculous!  Ah, presidential tracking poll, Bush 48.8%, Kerry 47.4%.  47.4%. 
[00:07:00]  This is ridiculous.  Your election coverage has begun.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Is there any reason to start election coverage?  And there's the douche that is spoiling it for everyone.  Nader, 1% of the polls right now.  1%.  In Florida, right?  Florida, 48.3% for Bush, 47.3% for Kerry, and 1% for Nader.  So figure it out.  That 1% is supposed to go to Kerry, you buzzkill. 
[00:07:30]  Why doesn't the Kerry camp shoot Ralph Nader?  He should just shoot him.  Yeah, he's not working for President Bush.  He's not a real candidate.  He's just that guy in there that screws it up for everybody.  He was sort of a real candidate last time around, but not this time around.  He was the spoiler last time, too.  Yeah.  Gore would have won.  Thank God.  If you're into Gore.  Thank God.  You know.  I can openly admit that.  Some people say we might be in better shape if Gore was in office. 
[00:08:00]  He's a raving lunatic.  As opposed to Bush.  See him on the cover of the papers with his thumb up and that maniacal look on his face.  I'm going to be President another four years.  He's like freaking out.  I got them bamboozled.  I got him.  I got him.  You know he's just sitting there during all the, he's going to be sitting there with  all his good old boy buddies watching the coverage, knowing he's going to win, just  winking at everyone with that wink he does with the thumb up across the room. 
[00:08:30]  He's going to be, yeah, I got it.  Don't you worry, boy.  We got it.  We're in another four years.  Oh, boy.  So you think it's over, Johnny?  It's been over.  If the Democrats could have gotten somebody in there that was a little better, they'd  gotten all the disenfranchised people, they would have gotten him.  They would have gotten him to vote for the Democrats.  Anthony?  Everyone that can't stand Bush, that was a, there are a lot of Republicans that don't  like Bush.  When you have people in your own party that are really disillusioned with you, it's kind 
[00:09:00]  of easy for the other team to come up there and win.  All you got to do is show him a little something, just something.  And the Democrats paraded out Frankenstein.  Botox man.  Frankenstein from Massachusetts.  And, you know, they labeled him as a flip-flopper and a bed-wetting liberal and, you know, he  hasn't done anything that really changed anyone's opinion.  You were pretty funny. 
[00:09:30]  We're sitting here in the studio and we're watching the TV and Kerry's getting off his  Kerry jet.  Yeah.  And you're like, they got the paint ready.  Oh, please.  Paint that jet over.  They got the paint.  They're going to spray that thing white again and fill it with real passengers.  Bring on the next clown.  It's over.  And you know something?  Kerry and Teresa Hines, they're just very wealthy people.  Teresa.  It's Teresa.  Teresa.  Teresa.  They have more money than, you know, you look at people that you think are rich. 
[00:10:00]  That ain't nothing compared to the money these two have.  And they're going to be very happy when this is all over.  I don't think, I don't even think he really wants to be president.  I think, uh, I think she especially is going to be very relieved.  Of course.  You always want to be bothered with the White House.  You know what she reminds me of?  That frigging bitch from, from Green Acres.  It's like Green Acres.  It's the, you know, oh, Oliver, Oliver, darling.  Okay.  Like, oh, she's rich.  She looks just like her.  Jesus. 
[00:10:30]  No, her whole attitude, she's rich.  Yeah.  But she's put in this life that she has to do things she really doesn't want to do because  of her man.  Now I'm completely with you.  That's pretty much what it was like, you know, Oliver.  Right.  You know, going to the Sam Drucker's store and having to pick up some goods and bring  them back to the house.  That's what she is.  She doesn't want to do this, but she's doing it because of her man.  Stand by your man.  Your Frankenstein.  When you first did Green Acres, I thought you meant the pig.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that too. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, she must be a joy to live with.  Doesn't she just look like somebody that could crack a good joke?  She's Eddie Vedder.  She's a drugged out, awful rich lady with her head always kind of slumped in a heroin  stupor.  She comes out on the stage after Kerry does his little speeches and after the debate,  she comes out and hugs him and there's just zero affection there.  You can just see this woman is a frigid, nothing bitch.  I don't think she's frigid.  I think it's just all the drugs she's on.  Maybe the drugs.  I don't know.  Well, that's my opinion.  You know, it just seems like she may be on something. 
[00:11:30]  If she's doing some kind of drugs, a lot of times these drugs take away your sex drive.  Maybe that's it because the woman has a zilch sex appeal.  As much as, you know, I'm sure John Kerry, boy, what sex appeal that guy has.  How do you come out of Massachusetts as a politician and not have some kind of sex appeal?  Even Ted Kennedy was getting laid on that lawn of his place.  You know, and Kerry's a real dope.  He's sporting his Boston Red Sox hat today.  Yeah.  There's a lot of people that don't like the Red Sox. 
[00:12:00]  Really?  And people are so stupid.  I thought everyone was a Red Sox fan.  And people are so stupid with their voting.  That's all it's going to take.  They see Kerry with the Red Sox hat on.  Like, all right, that's it.  I'm voting for Bush.  Screw them.  Screw them.  You know?  It's just, it's...  Well, Anthony, we have enough information, and I think we need to be the first ones out  there.  Oh, do we?  Yeah, we're announcing that Bush has won the presidential election.  Yes, with 0% of the precincts reported, we're just going to go ahead. 
[00:12:30]  Some people have voted already, so let's call it 0.01% of the voting is in.  Can we actually do this?  We are now saying that President Bush will continue being your president.  Yes.  You know, why not?  We did some research, and we found out through our research, we believe that he is the winner.  We are declaring him.  This program, the Opie and Anthony Show, has just declared George W. Bush the winner of  the presidential election 2004. 
[00:13:00]  That's it.  I just want to save people a lot of time today.  Right.  And I want to be the first.  Now, we are the first.  We are the first.  If you guys want to call the rest of the media...  The official announcement.  The official announcement has happened.  You don't have to wait for stupid Dan Rather or any of those other guys.  Get the media on the phone.  Why can't we just call somebody?  We are the media, and we're calling it already.  Why can't we call the Post or call CNN?  Call CNN and tell them we have already declared Bush the winner.  Because we're too lazy to do election coverage. 
[00:13:30]  We have absolutely declared George W. Bush the winner.  Yes.  We have enough information to let you people know that that's what's going to happen today.  Yes?  Our hearts and minds go out to John Kerry and his family.  They fought a hard fight.  Our hearts and minds go out.  They fought the tough fight.  You know, and I understand how you fight the tough fight.  You know, because I've done that before.  So, I just can't wait until, what, midnight? 
[00:14:00]  When do they do that?  But who knows when they count these things up, if it's close and all kinds of problems.  I know they screw it up right before midnight.  But I love the concession speech.  You know, I cannot wait to hear one of them come up after.  What do you mean one?  We already declared the winner.  Yes, it's going to be John Kerry.  We know that.  When he's got to get up there, after a year of slamming Bush, just slamming him,  he's got to get up there and tell his people, I am conceding to George Bush, and then all  of the people.  No. 
[00:14:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No, people.  People.  People.  No.  Kerry.  Kerry.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Kerry.  Kerry.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Kerry.  Thank you.  No.  Thank you.  No.  No.  People.  People.  People.  Please.  Kerry.  Please.  We must.  We must now stand behind our great leader.  Boo.  This man.  Wait.  But you were just tooling on the asshole an hour ago.  No.  He told us how much you hate him. 
[00:15:00]  He is a great leader, and we must stand behind him.  Boo.  No.  No, people.  It's this whole thing of him chastising his audience for booing that the guy won, the same  guy you were just beating up for a year straight, calling him a liar.  Eric called, oh, and they just, they boo him, and no, no, 20 times, 20 thank yous.  Right, right.  And then that he's great, and we must now stand behind him.  Yeah.  And his foolhardy policy that I was bashing for a year. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, which means the last year and a half was all BS.  I was lying to you.  Right.  This is a great man.  I actually like him.  That's what he should be saying.  And Bush gets on for his, you know, to accept, and he does the same thing.  Right.  But, you know, John Kerry was a great, great candidate, and, you know, he fought a good  fight.  It was a very clean and wonderful.  No, wait a minute.  Yeah, he patronizes him, and everyone's clapping.  What about the Swift book, guys?  I called him a crock of career shit.  What happened? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, what happened to that, George Bush?  What happened to that?  That John Kerry was a liar.  Ah, I love it.  I love the hypocrisy, the crap, the crap that the American people gobble up like so much  pudding.  Ooh, let me gobble more up.  Just feed it to me.  I'll gobble.  Anthony, I've got to break in, because we are doing a little election coverage today.  Well, we'll cover it, but we've already announced.  We're amongst the people today.  We sent our interns out on the streets of New York City.  I want to call the studio Freedom Studio. 
[00:16:30]  Freedom Studio?  We're broadcasting today from Freedom Studios.  Okay.  That just so happens, everybody, it's either Freedom, Democracy, or what's the other one?  Well, Rockefeller Plaza, they're doing a big thing there today.  Oh, no, it's Democracy Plaza now.  Oh, it's now called Democracy Plaza.  Anytime you want to rename something, it's got to be Freedom, Democracy, or Liberty.  Liberty.  When do they, I heard Brokaw say that.  Do they actually rename that for real?  Yes, it's renamed Democracy Plaza. 
[00:17:00]  Why?  Because in this country, we have to get the patriotism up and make everyone feel good about our country.  So whenever we rename anything, it has to be Freedom, Liberty, or Democracy.  Because it makes us feel better.  Doesn't that seem, it reminds me of Russia.  Remember how Russia was always the peoples and the states?  And it's the same vibe that I'm getting.  If they rename it Freedom, then we must have plenty of freedom. 
[00:17:30]  And if it's Democracy, then we must be living in a democracy.  Liberty, we must be just overflowing with liberty.  And these names are sticking with these things.  And they assume that every American feels so good about themselves and feels so good at living in America  because there's so much freedom around because the places are named Freedom.  Give us some patriotic music today there, Eric.  I understand they're doing that in Harlem, too.  There's a new place now called Three-Fifths of a Vote Plaza. 
[00:18:00]  All right, so we're amongst the people today, Anthony.  Yes, we are.  Our intern, I think it's Danny, he was the one that brought in the Oompa Loompa t-shirts.  Oh, yes, yes.  I believe the eBay auction is over as far as the Oompa Loompa autograph t-shirt.  I'm hearing about controversy, though.  Why?  I'm reading eBay high bidder box on paying.  Of course he did.  Is what I'm reading.  Box on paying for the Oompa Loompa t-shirt.  It went for like $500, I thought.  $500 and the scumbag isn't paying up? 
[00:18:30]  No, he sent me an email saying that he was just trying to increase the price.  The real guy who won the bid backed out at the last moment, so he got stuck with the tab.  What a dick bag.  Yeah.  What he's trying to, you know something?  Screw him.  It ought to stick.  Well, if he won't do it, there's somebody else emailed me saying he'll gladly pay the full amount.  Unbelievable.  I might go to him.  He should be kicked off of eBay.  I agree.  America!  Let's turn this up. 
[00:19:00]  I feel very patriotic this morning.  Don't you know what God done shit he'll graze on me?  Is this Jamie Foxx singing this?  I hate how they're touting him for an Oscar for that movie.  He doesn't even do his own singing.  At least Sissy Spacek and Coal Miner's daughter did her own singing.  Val Kilmer did too.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing. 
[00:19:30]  Did Gary Busey?  Did Angela Bassett?  For T.O. Turner?  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing. 
[00:20:00]  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing. 
[00:20:30]  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  Val Kilmer did his own singing.  I love you America!  I love you America!  I love you America!  I love you America!  I love you America!  I love you America!  Let's go!  He, he, he found it! 
[00:21:00]  He told me he would!  And we'd like to do it!  From the sea to  the sky  the sea  Thank you!  Thank you!  Yeah!  Happy Election Day!  Where did Danny go?  He was out with the homeless guy. 
[00:21:30]  I know, he was on the line and we lost him.  The guy ran away.  Oh, the guy ran away?  Happy Election Day.  Where did Danny go?  We lost him.  The guy ran away.  Oh, the guy ran away?  Okay.  We're doing our own polling today, Anthony.  We got our intern Danny on the streets today, and he's going to be talking to people, seeing  who they're voting for this morning.  But we're already announcing that Bush is going to continue being president of the United  States.  Yes, we've checked in.  We have enough information, and we feel pretty good about our decision to announce that he 
[00:22:00]  is going to continue.  Yes.  Bush, the winner of election 2004.  We are the first to announce it.  Let's say hi to Jim in Boston.  Hey, Jim.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good, man.  I just wanted to see if I'm hearing you guys right.  And you said for a year and a half that you hated Bush.  You hate everything he's doing.  You just don't like him.  But now you're still going to vote for him because Kerry's not attractive?  Hey, man.  He saw the Osama bin Laden tape. 
[00:22:30]  He got scared into voting for Bush today.  Do you think it has to do with the fact that he's not attractive?  I don't know.  You talk about how he is Frankenstein and he's like a zombie.  The Frankenstein thing is more than just the look, my friend.  The guy has nothing.  What do you mean nothing?  He is vacant.  The guy has nothing.  I can't vote for the guy.  That's how bad the Democrats screwed this up.  I so was looking to vote for someone else. 
[00:23:00]  I don't like Bush.  I don't want to vote for Bush.  I don't want to go in there and pull that handle and vote for George Bush.  I don't want to do it.  But look what they've done.  Anthony's going to be a Republican, too.  Right.  You don't even have to vote for Kerry.  You can vote for nobody.  You can just fill in goddamn Opie as you're writing and voting.  Yeah, and that's going to do it.  You know something?  The truth of the matter is New York goes to Kerry anyway.  Our vote doesn't count.  People don't even understand how the voting process works and the Electoral College. 
[00:23:30]  They don't even understand the fact that it doesn't matter who you're voting for in New York State.  It doesn't matter.  It goes to Kerry.  It's going to Kerry.  It doesn't matter.  Very nice.  So my vote doesn't count.  If I vote for Bush, who cares?  Well, Pennsylvania is a swing state, right?  Yeah, but that doesn't matter for me.  Ron, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Who are you voting for today?  I'm going to vote for Bush.  But since he's already won, why should I bother?  Right.  There you go. 
[00:24:00]  We're declaring him the winner.  We have declared Bush the winner, yes.  I'm looking forward to all the celebrities that are going to move out now to Bush 1.  Like Miss Robin Quiver, she claims that she can move out of the country if Bush 1  because she's afraid for her life.  She said something in between laughing?  Yeah, she's afraid for her life.  She says that she will probably die because of all the terror activity.  They'll come over here when Bush wins.  That is funny when the celebrities get together and say they're going to leave the country.  Some of them have.  They usually go to France, which is great. 
[00:24:30]  Who left?  Who left?  Well, not for those reasons.  Celebrities like to just leave the country.  Johnny Depp.  Who's that other one?  Madonna.  What's her name from 16 Candles?  Molly Ringwald.  Molly Ringwald.  She moved out?  Yeah, she left.  I think she was forced out after all those bad movies she did after 16 Candles.  Where'd she move to?  She had no choice.  France.  Paris.  Yeah.  They all moved to France.  France.  France.  Where they can let their armpit hair grow.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, Chris.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hello.  Who are you voting for today?  I'm voting for Kerry.  Here you go.  And why?  Because I don't like Bush.  I feel like Kerry will get the soldiers out of Iraq and all that type of shit.  All right.  So what do you have today?  I'm calling because I've been listening to you guys for a while,  but I start to get the feeling now that you guys are back on the air,  I feel like a little bit more racism deep down built in in you guys.  Is that true?  Well, yesterday was a very racially heated show because of Halloween. 
[00:25:30]  Well, Anthony is now living in a Jewish neighborhood,  and I think he's being influenced by his Jewish neighbors.  You think there's an influence happening there?  Well, I'm noticing your sideburns are starting to get a little longer.  Are you going to start curling them?  I'm going to curl them.  No, it's a racially charged show yesterday.  Are you a brother, my brother?  No, no, no.  All right.  I try to be sensitive to the brothers.  No, but I don't know.  It seems like maybe something happened to you.  Maybe you got robbed while you were on vacation.  No.  Honestly, this is how we really feel,  and we just know that most of the shwoogies can't afford XM satellite radio, 
[00:26:00]  so we're very safe to see who our hate radio.  Yeah, this is hate radio because we know they're not listening,  and we don't have to be afraid of them anymore,  and this is how it's going to be for now on.  Hate radio.  Are you saying they can't afford to XM?  Well, it's been known.  Well, they got the rhyme and all the souls of the soul station.  Look, dude, you're being more racist than us.  Jesus.  I mean, no, it's still funny as hell.  No, you know what?  You're probably right, 
[00:26:30]  and what we do try to do on this show is try to balance everything.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Yeah, where are they at?  Oh, Lordy, Lordy.  Yo, man, they're going to eat your food.  And, Chris, you know, I'm insulted that you say that  because I got my hair did last night.  I got my hair did.  You say that in my favor.  I eat your food.  I got my hair did.  I have started the new GTA game,  and I got my hair did.  Yeah, maybe that's having something to do with it.  I went with the Afro and the goatee. 
[00:27:00]  I went with the Afro, too, on GTA.  And I haven't found the tattoo parlor yet.  I found the tattoo parlor.  I got some good tats,  and, yeah, I'm cruising around now,  just racking some head.  It's nice.  I love the game.  Yeah.  I haven't opened up barely any of it.  No.  I'm in one little section of the map.  I haven't gone over.  I think Steve C swam over to the Vegas-like section.  Oh, really?  I can't get over the bridges or anything.  They're not unblocked yet.  I don't know what I've got to do. 
[00:27:30]  I don't know how far I've got to go.  I'm just trying to figure out the control still.  Did Steve C swim there,  or did Gunnery Sergeant Hartman tell him to run?  Oh, yeah.  We better take...  Oh, no.  You know, today we've got to take breaks  because I think they sold some commercials, so...  They did.  Yeah, why don't we step aside?  We have to talk about Steve C.  It's pretty amazing what he did to himself today.  Also, Anthony, Stalker Patty,  oh, she's on the line right now?  What does she want?  Oh, man.  Let me see if she can wait.  We ran into her at the Brooklyn Diner yesterday. 
[00:28:00]  Patty.  Yeah, hi.  How are you doing?  Can you wait like four minutes?  Sure.  All right.  We'll be right back with you.  She's trying to get Lady Di a job.  Sure.  How is Patty helping people?  We'll find out next.  You know something?  I've got to be completely honest.  Stalker Patty's kind of gotten her crap together,  and it's really pissing me off.  I know.  We need her to be a disaster.  She was a complete misfit disaster,  just a walking clusterfuck.  And now she has a job, 
[00:28:30]  a nice place in Times Square.  She's got satellite radio,  cable television,  and now she's helping others  that are a little downtrodden.  Yeah, we'll see what she's doing.  What happened?  I think I know what happened.  We were off the air two years.  We've got to get back to screwing her life up.  Oh, we'll do that.  Absolutely.  No worries on that.  Also, Anthony, a little later in the show,  the Oprah magazine came out  with the 50 greatest chick flicks of all time.  Oprah?  Oh, wow. 
[00:29:00]  50?  And we're going to have a little bed in the studio today  to see who the biggest fag is.  We have all 50 movies in front of us.  50 chick flicks.  And we're all going to look at this list  and see how many of these stupid movies  we've actually seen.  We need complete disclosure here.  Complete honesty.  Complete honesty.  We're going to do this later on in the show.  Who wants in?  I'll do it, and we'll do it.  Obviously, Norton will do it.  Who do you think?  Wait a minute.  Sex Bagels raising his hand.  Let me look around the room.  Yeah, but with the highlights, though, 
[00:29:30]  I think Sex Bagels should be disqualified.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Look at him.  What?  With his hair highlighted?  Look at him.  Ben, I would bet Ben hasn't seen one of these movies.  No, he's too busy drinking.  No, Ben's probably seen more than most of us.  No, I couldn't see Ben seeing it.  Ben would be like,  I don't want to tell you.  No, I'm going to guess that Steve C.,  the one that looks the toughest.  Steve C., you think, has seen the most?  Has seen the most chick flicks.  I will definitely go with him on that one. 
[00:30:00]  All right, so we're going to get into that as well,  and really a lot to do,  so why don't we step aside.  In honor of Election Day, Anthony,  from Team America,  America, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  America.  America.  America.  America.  Fuck yeah.  Coming again to save the motherfucking day.  America.  Fuck yeah.  Freedom is the only way. 
[00:30:30]  Terrorists, your game is through.  Cause now you have to answer to America.  Fuck yeah.  So lick my butt and suck on my balls.  America.  Fuck yeah.  What you gonna do when we come for you now?  It's the dream that we all share.  It's the home for tomorrow.  Fuck yeah.  Together. 
[00:31:00]  Fuck yeah.  Ram on.  Fuck yeah.  The gas.  Fuck yeah.  Baseball.  Fuck yeah.  NFL.  Fuck yeah.  Rock and roll.  Fuck yeah.  Internet.  Fuck yeah.  Slagery.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Starbuck.  Fuck yeah.  Disney World.  Fuck yeah.  Porno.  Fuck yeah.  Value.  Fuck yeah.  Revives.  Fuck yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Fake tits.  Fuck yeah.  Sushi.  Fuck yeah.  Taco Bell.  Fuck yeah.  Rodeo.  Fuck yeah.  Fat Bath and Beyond.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Liberty.  Fuck yeah.  White slips.  Fuck yeah.  The Alamo.  Fuck yeah.  Band-Aids.  Fuck yeah.  Las Vegas.  Fuck yeah.  Christmas.  Fuck yeah.  Immigrant.  Fuck yeah.  Popeye.  Fuck yeah.  Democrat.  Fuck yeah.  The Republicans.  Fuck yeah.  Fucking shit.  Books.  We're doing it out here niggas. 
[00:32:00]  We're doing it out here niggas.  We're about to take all the millions.  You hear me?  All I got to say to XM Satellite is fuck my dick because they ain't give me no money.  The UB and Anthony show. 
[00:32:30]  XM Radio cash out all day everything.  Get that bitch nigga.  Stop pushing me.  Fuck you bitch.  My midget buddy wants to be a weatherman but they'll never be a midget weatherman.  No one would believe them.  A flood is coming.  Yeah to you.  What did someone leave a faucet on or some shit?  We call my midget buddy baby shoes because he's got tiny little feet.  And he calls me horse cock Johnson because four inches is pretty big to a midget. 
[00:33:00]  Ah me and baby shoe.  We do everything together except seesaw because that really wouldn't be fair to him.  The other day me and baby shoes my midget buddy were hanging around my house thinking  of ways to turn in my garage into a crystal meth lab.  You know guy shit.  All of a sudden he gets up off my bed, repels down the phone cord to the floor and goes 
[00:33:30]  hey man I gotta get going I'm late.  Then he starts running and running.  Have you ever seen a midget in a hurry?  Well you'd know if you had because they don't slowly get smaller like you and me.  They just disappear right away.  And then there's a beautiful rainbow.  He was late for work.  For work.  If I was a midget man I'd be constantly late.  I'd come in hours late.  My boss would be all pissed off.  Where were you?  Why were you late? 
[00:34:00]  I'm trying to run a chocolate factory around here.  What's going on?  Hotel?  I'd be like why was I late?  Look at these little legs.  There was a puddle.  I had to swim it fucker.  Oh my god.  I'm sorry.  I thought I had a parrot on my shoulder.  You ever get that? 
[00:34:30]  Nothing.  Nothing.  I wish I had a parrot.  I really do.  And I wouldn't teach them dirty words or songs.  No.  I would teach them phone numbers and addresses and recipes.  I'd use them more like a palm pilot.  You know?  Or I'd teach them things that might save my life.  You know like information.  Like in case of an earthquake get in the doorway.  Baaah.  No one has freckles on their ass.  Use a condom. 
[00:35:00]  Baaah.  Thank you, parrot.  Here's a grape.  We played street football right there on the street.  And this is where we had the greatest quarterback in the world.  Our quarterback, he had to control 23 men on the side.  And he was really great at it.  You women don't know anything about it.  You played with dolls and stuff like that. 
[00:35:30]  But here's a guy with an ingenious mind.  He'd call a football play like this.  He'd always get down on one knee and draw things.  You know, he'd take a Coke bottle top.  Now, uh, Shorty, this is you.  This is a Coke bottle.  I don't want to be the Coke bottle top.  Okay.  Uh, what do you want to be?  I want to be the piece of glass.  Okay.  Now, listen to this now.  Uh, Arnie, go down, uh, ten steps.  And cut left behind the black Chevy. 
[00:36:00]  Philbert, you run down to my house and wait in the living room.  Cosby, you go down to Third Street, catch the J-Bus.  Have him open the doors at 19th Street.  I'll fake it to you.  You always have one fat kid.  They never throw it to you.  What about me?  You go long.  Get a lot of good plays going like that. 
[00:36:30]  I'll throw it over the water tower.  You'll catch it as it bounces off.  Can you say fuck on this channel?  Oh, Jesus.  That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee.  Do you have an Audi?  This is the best show ever.  The OB and Anthony Show.  Yeah, you're checking out the O&A Show.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Thank you for checking us out. 
[00:37:00]  Thank you.  All right, we've got to get right to the phone.  Stalker Patty checking in.  She's been on hold for like 15, 20 minutes.  Patty.  Hi, how you doing?  Do you have a cell phone now?  Yes, I am.  Yes, I do.  How did you get a cell phone?  It's a prepaid cell phone.  What's a prepaid cell phone?  You just pay the money ahead of time.  You get all unlimited calling, unlimited long distance. 
[00:37:30]  Unlimited.  During the week.  You've really gotten your life together.  Well, yeah.  We're very proud of you, Patty.  Oh, thank you.  No, we're not.  The day about Lady Di.  All right, yeah.  So, we're at the Brooklyn Diner, and big surprise, you were there also yesterday.  You were there every morning getting your, what, tea?  My coffee and muffins.  You get a coffee and a muffin.  It's prepaid at the Brooklyn Diner.  Everything I do is prepaid.  And you came over and said hi. 
[00:38:00]  Yes, I did.  And then you told us that you're trying to get Lady Di a job, huh?  Yeah, she's terribly lazy.  And I called her last night.  She didn't even get anywhere writing down her resume.  Oh, she's got to write on a piece of paper everything she's done.  All right.  That I know.  Well, she's got to write everything she did.  All right, listen.  So, how did you get involved with Lady Di's awful life?  Well, she was telling me she hasn't worked in two years, which to me is ridiculous. 
[00:38:30]  Most people find a job within three to six months, you know?  It's not always ridiculous to not work for two years, okay?  Don't rub it in.  Yeah, you know, but it's like, I think she's just very lazy.  She is very lazy.  She's a fat, lazy drunk is what she is.  Well, she's an alcoholic, I think.  Personally, I think she's an alcoholic.  I think she's a raging alcoholic at this point.  We haven't seen her in a while, and I couldn't believe the change in her.  She's starting to look like Throw Mama from the Train now. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  You know, her hair's unwashed and unkept and just stringy,  and her face is starting to take on a round, like, tomato-type look to it.  Yeah, even Marion has tried to straighten her out.  You know, she's still got her steady job.  She's got a little promotion there.  And when Marion and Patty have to straighten you out, just think of how done you are.  I know.  I don't know.  She just won't cooperate.  Why don't you get her job at the chocolate place?  Yes, I will. 
[00:39:30]  Yes, I promise that nothing comes of it.  All right, so you're trying to get her to update her resume with all the things she's done.  Yeah, I'll even go out of my way and go to the computer room, type it out on the word perfect, and even run it off.  On the word perfect?  The word perfect?  Well, I thought public assistance, you know, they have job assistance services in New York.  It's a requirement when you're on that.  I wonder what New Jersey is.  Okay, so what does she want to do for a career at this point? 
[00:40:00]  I have no idea, you know, because I don't know what I have.  Well, she has driven a forklift at her last job.  She is a forklift.  All right, so she's driven on a forklift when they were picking her up out of her apartment.  You know, people that run equipment like that can make up to $30 an hour.  Her last job, she was making like $22 an hour.  Look at Patty.  She's like a recruiter now.  You know, but... 
[00:40:30]  She's getting people jobs.  All right, well, you've got to keep in touch and let us know what's going on with Lady Di, okay?  What are you going to do with her today?  Well, I'm going to just keep calling her until she sends me whatever she's done, her resume.  Has she sent you anything so far?  Nothing.  I gave her my address and everything, you know?  What does she say when you ask her for it?  She says, yes, I will.  Yeah, you're right.  Okay.  There you go, one of those people.  All right, why don't you get her a job at the chocolate factory? 
[00:41:00]  No, I was advised by a few people that it wouldn't be for her.  She doesn't want to vouch for her, man.  That's true.  Well, if she doesn't work out, it'll be on me, you know?  I don't want the embarrassment if she doesn't work out.  Big, fat, Augustus gloop face with the chocolate all around her mouth.  She'll just be there eating the profits.  How are you?  How are you?  I mean, she did have a short stint at a supermarket, and that didn't work out.  She should probably not work around anything edible. 
[00:41:30]  She tends to eat a lot.  I could picture a Godiva chocolate just biting in half everything just to see what's in the center.  I know.  Putting it back on the counter.  I have customers come in.  I don't know how you stay so thin, you know?  Oh, boy, yeah.  All right, Patty.  Well, keep us updated with Lady Di's progress.  And we're still trying to find a gynecologist to look at your twat, so hang in there. 
[00:42:00]  Okay, and she needs a kick in the butt.  Where are you now?  Me, I'm at work now.  I just got into my building.  I've got to go to the loading dock.  Oh, you're loading the chocolate off the truck today?  Yeah, I take the delivery and check it, and then I receive it into the register.  What are you checking for?  Well, make sure we've got everything.  There's a lot of Christmas is coming in.  She's got to count it.  One, two, three, few.  Yeah, we're turning our floor over to Christmas now. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, you're doing the Christmas thing now.  Just in time, yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, Patty.  Okay.  Keep us updated, all right?  I sure will.  Maybe that slob could dress like Santa and be in your store.  Yeah, she'd be a department store Santa.  There you go.  Big, fat Santa.  Ten bucks an hour.  She would make a perfect Santa.  Dumb red face.  Big, fat, red, drunk face she's got.  The big, red nose like St. Nick's is supposed to have.  She's got it from booze.  Yeah, she's big and fat. 
[00:43:00]  She wouldn't need a padded costume.  Yeah.  Do you think she's a bit of a slob, Patty?  Well, her appearance didn't look great the last couple of times that I've seen her,  and one of the last functions we went to was a comedy show in March,  and she was told by somebody behind us to calm down.  Yeah, she's got real problems.  All right, Patty, we're going to let you be, okay?  Thank you.  Okay.  All right, and we're still looking for a gynecologist in the New York area to look at Patty's twat. 
[00:43:30]  It's been 20 years since...  She is a 50-year-old virgin, by the way.  Right.  Which is amazing, but completely understandable because she's insane.  She sounds all normal now.  Well, aside from that annoying voice, but doesn't she sound normal?  She's trying to help other people out.  She's got a job.  She's a...  Oh, fucker.  She's turning into Mary Tyler Moore, I think.  Yeah.  She's taking on the city, Anthony.  She's taking on the city.  She's throwing that little wool hat of hers up in the air. 
[00:44:00]  Wouldn't that be great to watch her throw the wig up in the air?  Right.  And have her shaved head underneath it?  Yeah, she's...  I'm gonna make it after you.  She's, uh...  Yeah, she's working for Mr. Grant there.  Oh, Mr. Grant.  Little career woman.  She's got a little penthouse apartment, right?  Yeah, sure.  She's doing very well.  She's doing some, uh...  No matter how much we try to undermine it.  All right.  Hey, uh, Sam the Trucker, what's going on?  All right, man. 
[00:44:30]  Y'all fucking rock, dude.  I listened to yesterday's show.  Way to go.  Calling out that fucking Raquel, bitch.  Thank you, man.  Oh, we're gonna have an update on that, by the way,  because Jim Norton's been talking to Taylor.  Taylor Law, L-A-W-E.  Oh.  She's got her latest DVD out there.  And what's going on with that, Jim, real fast?  She's supposed to call in today, I believe,  to respond with the other girl.  Oh, gosh.  Very good.  Yeah, because she got a trashing from Raquel yesterday.  Which, uh, was unfair, I do believe,  because I think Taylor and Mia were really hot on Friday.  Of course they are.  You gotta hear both sides of the story.  All right. 
[00:45:00]  What's up, Sam?  Good old Jim fueling the fire.  You go, Norton.  Anyway, so, uh, fucking Bush, he rocks, man.  Uh, he got rid of the electric chair when he was governor of Texas,  and that fucking put in an electric bench, right?  Oh, oh.  Oh, that old gag.  Yeah, that old gag.  That old gag.  But anyways, okay, there we go.  Wasn't it, like, electric bleachers?  There you go.  Wasn't that the joke?  Electric bleachers.  All right, all right, I guess.  Well, okay, anyways, y'all rock,  and, uh, don't forget to send me my WOW sticker 
[00:45:30]  I sent in the email, and, uh, Norton,  where'd you get that box, man?  What box?  The box I stood on the last time you gave me Oral Lovin'.  Ha-ha.  Very good.  Y'all have a good one.  Y'all rock.  All right, take it easy.  Here's the real horn.  Here we go, here we go.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine that behind you?  That sounds like the one that comes up behind you  and rams you off the road.  Large, large is coming through.  Without trucks, America stops. 
[00:46:00]  Y'all keep on rocking.  All right, thank you, Sam.  Sam's, uh, out of his freaking mind.  Without trucks, I don't have to replace my windshield as often,  and, uh, I could actually get from point A to point B a lot quicker.  Thank you.  Let's go to Lou in Connecticut.  Hey, Lou.  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Good to have you guys back.  Oh, thanks.  Awesome.  Hey, oh, I was listening to you.  You mentioned you were, uh, you mentioned you couldn't find the tattoo pilot.  No, well, not yet.  I'm just getting into the game.  Uh, we're talking about Grand Theft Auto, the latest version.  San Andreas.  Uh, yes.  Laszlo is supposed to come on the show very soon 
[00:46:30]  to give us the ins and outs of that game, so.  Absolutely worst thing I ever bought,  just based on the fact that I can't play more than three hours the afternoon  and my wife comes home.  I can't do anything anymore.  Oh, she gets mad at you for playing?  Oh, can't play.  She hates it.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Constantly.  Ain't that a bitch?  Hey, it is a bitch, you know?  I definitely went with the Afro, too, so that was easy.  I think everyone goes with the Afro.  I went with the Afro, too.  Gotta go with the Afro.  It's hilarious, because it's pretty much white guys playing this game,  and they're being integrated into the black, like, culture. 
[00:47:00]  Go to the barbershop.  I went to the barbershop.  You went to the barbershop?  And they give you all this stuff you could get?  Yeah.  I was, like, feeling good.  I'm like, I'm going with the Afro.  Oh, you're hooking up with your homies and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  I'm starting to learn how to talk to them and stuff.  Yeah, you talk to your homeboys, and you know one of them is either going to turn on you.  It is now.  It is paper, not cheddar.  You're right.  I learned that already so far.  Thanks to GTA.  The tattoo parlor is, like, two steps up to the left where you get your hair cut.  Oh, okay.  I'm going to get that belly tat today, man. 
[00:47:30]  You getting the belly tat?  I'm going to get, like, opia across my midriff in that nasty lettering that Tupac used to have.  Have you been to the gym, Opie?  Have you gone to the gym and worked your guy out?  Oh, yeah.  I ate a lot of pizza.  I don't know what that is.  Oh, it's going to make you fat.  But I kept ordering pizza thinking that something was wrong with the game, and I didn't know you ate the pizza at the counter.  My guy was getting really fat.  I thought he was going to take the pizza and sit down and eat it like a human being.  You've got to go to the gym.  I went to the gym.  I got the muscles all the way up now.  Oh, yeah?  All the way up on my levels. 
[00:48:00]  Nice.  Very good.  We are grown men, by the way, just in case you're wondering at home.  What's that?  What station are you guys at so I can hear you, like, during the game?  I've played the game just fooling around, you know, at least three or four hours so far.  I haven't really done much of anything, just exploring, and I still haven't heard our little cameo.  We're on one of the talk stations, I believe.  Yeah, I'm trying to look for it.  It's nothing, Hugh.  I mean, it was cool for us, but it's a quick call-in to one of the talk shows on the radio.  Ah, gotcha.  All right, we've got to cut you off, dude, because we've got Nathaniel. 
[00:48:30]  He's one of our interns.  He's out on the streets today, and he's polling people, seeing who they're voting for today, Anthony.  It's our election coverage.  It's our election coverage, even though we have declared Bush the winner already.  Based on our scientific analysis of all the data that is coming in, we have declared George Bush the winner.  And if you're listening to this in replay, we announce this at 6, 10 a.m. East Coast time this morning.  What do you got, bro?  I got Tony with me right here.  All right, let's talk to Tony, see who he's voting for, Anthony. 
[00:49:00]  Tony.  All right, Tony, who do you like better, George Bush or John Kerry?  I like George Bush.  Why do you like him?  Why do I like him?  I think he's done a good job, and I think he's going to do a good job this election.  Well, that's surprising.  And what does Tony do for a living?  What do you do for a living?  Right now, I'm homeless, but I'm a 23-year plumber.  23-year plumber?  He's a plumber, and he's homeless?  Yeah.  And he thinks Bush is doing a good job?  Yeah, what do you like in particular about Bush's job? 
[00:49:30]  What I like about his job, I just think he's taken care of business since he's been in there.  He's helped some of us out.  Some things I didn't disagree.  How long have you been homeless?  Well, he doesn't want to hand the phone over to the guy.  No, I know.  Oh, I don't know.  I really don't know about it.  Hey, Nathaniel.  He's doing a good job to me.  Hello?  All right.  Hello? 
[00:50:00]  How long has he been homeless?  How long have you been homeless, sir?  About eight years now.  Oh, eight years.  Okay.  All right, so Clinton made him homeless.  Clinton made him homeless.  Ask him what went wrong.  How did he go from being a plumber to being homeless?  I got it.  What happened eight years ago?  How did he go from being a plumber to being a plumber?  Well, my wife died, and I just, I got to drinking and all, and I went downhill, you know, and I just, and here in the city, I'm from Georgia, and here in the city, I came, and everything's union, and I just, you know, I can't, I can't get on my feet because I'm not union. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  All right, well, so far, yeah, well, I think that's it.  We got a vote for Bush so far, right?  Vote for Bush.  All right, thank you.  All right, thanks.  All right, our interns will be checking in from time to time.  That one was, uh.  One homeless guy for Bush.  That one was downright depressing, actually.  Downright depressing.  This was supposed to be kind of lighthearted, and that was kind of sad. 
[00:51:00]  It's never a story like, well, I won the lotto, and I made so much money, I decided I'm just going to throw my house away and hang out in the park all day.  I don't know.  It's always a horrible story, the homeless.  I don't know.  We've been very successful finding the fun-loving homeless.  The fun-loving homeless.  But they never have an angle that, it was never a good story that put them in the situation that got them homeless.  Tippy Tom, a lot of fun.  I'm sure there wasn't a good situation, though. 
[00:51:30]  That made them homeless.  What about Ziggy?  Ah, rest in peace, Ziggy.  A barrel of laughs.  For those listeners that were familiar with our program on WNEW, Ziggy, the homeless guy, sang Silent Night.  Remember that rendition of Silent Night?  He's dead.  Ziggy's dead.  He's dead?  Died in the street, Opie.  I wonder if he was wearing his nice jacket that we got him at the mall. 
[00:52:00]  You never know.  For a little holiday promotion.  Let's say hi to Chuck in Illinois.  Illinois is still the sexiest state in America, by the way.  And there's supposedly a couple in Ohio that wants to take on Illinois today.  Go ahead, Chuck.  The swing state of Ohio.  Hey, that plumber.  There's plenty of people around here with clogged toilets.  He can't be homeless.  Plumbers make a lot of money.  Well, I think he's got other problems going on.  Eight years he hasn't been a plumber.  Hey, I'm a truck driver, and if a woman's all that damn bad, he needs to start driving a truck. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Sounds a little more psychological than something.  I don't think I want him behind a big rig, actually, that homeless guy.  He may be hitting the sauce just a bit.  Hitting the sauce, yes.  Hey, Ben, could you go get Steve C. for a second?  We've got to ask him something.  Greg from Long Island, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  I just want to let you know that since you declared Bush the winner already, I got my bumper sticker on my car saying,  Don't blame me.  I voted for Kerry.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good one.  All right.  Take care. 
[00:53:00]  Thank you, buddy.  Yeah, that'll help you out.  All right, we're going to get Steve in here for a second.  We can grab one more phone call, talk to Rob in Virginia.  Hey, Rob.  Hey, what's up, gentlemen?  Who are you voting for today?  Thank you.  I don't have to vote because it was decided on Sunday when your wrist is lost.  Every year, 16 straight years in a row, if the Redskins lose, whoever's in office is voted out.  You know, our local paper had that whole thing, too.  You know, all these things that happen, Anthony?  Yep.  And if the Redskins...  Wait, what's the deal with the Redskins again?  I'm sorry. 
[00:53:30]  16 years straight, when they win, whoever's in office stays in office.  Whoever's not in office gets in the office.  So you don't even need to vote at this point, huh?  Exactly.  It's over.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Hey, I got one other thing.  Yeah.  Um, I think, last night I jumped on, I was playing Vice City.  Yeah.  And I noticed, this weekend I was playing the new one, and when you run over people in  the new one, or when you run over the golfers, you don't get any white stars.  So I jumped on last night on the PC, and I was playing Vice City, and I ran over one 
[00:54:00]  person, and I got a white star, and then I ran over another one, and then pretty soon  I got a helicopter chasing me.  So I guess you can run over golfers in San Andreas, and it's okay.  Well, you can't do it in front of cops.  No, I could, yeah, I could explain that, because, uh, especially early in the game  in GTA, what he's saying, you know, usually when you kill someone by running your car  over them, the police are aware.  Right.  But in the new GTA, you're in the hood where the cops aren't hanging out yet.  So you get away with a lot more in the beginning of the game.  Steve.  Yeah.  What the hell happened to your head? 
[00:54:30]  Oh, that was a nice thing.  Um, we've all been kind of whispering around your back, we're wondering if you're feeling  okay.  Oh, what?  Oh, the hair that was, um, me trying to even out my sideburns last night, and then going  dreadfully wrong, so I just said, screw it, I got rid of everything.  It'll roll back in a couple weeks.  Wait, just because you couldn't get your sideburns correct?  Dude, you have a foot of sideburn to work with every morning.  I know, I know, and I trimmed them.  This guy that likes to, you know, bring his sideburns way, way down, almost to his chin. 
[00:55:00]  No, I was trying to trim them, because they were getting really bushy, and I got the beard  trimmer out, and by the time I got done, it was past my ears, and it looked like I had  Christopher Reeve hair before the accident, and it looked like a wig, because he was,  you know.  But that would have grown in in two days.  Instead, you decided to take it all off.  Yeah, I decided to take it all off.  You're such a liar.  You decided that you wanted a new look.  No one just decides, oh, oops, I effed up my sideburn, I'm going to just shave my head.  Trust me.  It was going up and up and up, and then I said, screw it, let's just go and shave the 
[00:55:30]  whole thing.  You're absolutely right.  I wanted a new look, but it was after the whole sideburn mishap.  Our martinis allowed in the barracks!  Because we know you haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately, you're working your balls  off for the radio show, and next thing you know, you're coming in looking like this,  we're getting a little worried about you.  What?  You have no hair, and you have a flame hat on, you're just an odd guy.  I know.  I mean, I'm cool with that.  I really have no problem with...  What side was that, private pile?  Sir, left side, sir!  Are you sure, private pile?  Sir, yes, sir! 
[00:56:00]  What side was that, private pile?  Sir, right side, sir!  As I'm doing it, I'm sitting there, I sat there and consciously thought, I'm going to  catch shit for this.  Ah, fuck it, who cares?  And I just shave it.  Let's take a look.  All right.  Wow.  Yeah.  You little scumbag!  I got your name!  I got your ass!  What is that, private pile?  Sir, jelly donuts, sir!  You are a private pile! 
[00:56:30]  Oh, come on.  You are a disgusting fat body, private pile!  Sir, the private's name is Charlene, sir.  The private's...  You make it so gay, though.  You always have that gay twinge.  I don't mind the whole enunciating properly thing.  I'm quite proud of the whole thing.  Very enunciative.  But you always put this gay, you know, twang on it.  Just a little bit.  Just a little.  I don't know.  Dude, you're not going to, like, kill yourself, are you, in the bathroom later?  Wouldn't that be great?  He's in the bathroom. 
[00:57:00]  In my underpants.  Gun.  Yeah.  There you go.  No.  You didn't really take it down right to the scalp, though, did you?  No.  No.  This is...  That's the way the military does it, man.  You know what it is?  It's as close as you can get.  Yeah, I don't think you can get any...  Without taking a Bic razor to it.  No.  I just didn't...  I've done that before.  I did that once when I was in college, and it just...  You get all those stubble and bumps, and I just didn't...  It's Earl shaves his head.  Yeah.  Our own Black Earl.  And remember, Black Earl had a problem.  He was shaving his mustache one day and got it shaved uneven on one side and kept going 
[00:57:30]  in, in, in, but didn't make the commitment to shave it all off.  Remember the day Earl came in with a Hitler mustache?  Yeah.  I do remember that.  A Black Hitler.  And we were goofing on him.  He's Black Hitler in our studio.  And he said he kept shaving, and it kept looking uneven, so he just kept going.  Yeah.  Black Hitler.  But that's what happens.  That's what happened to you.  You have to commit to either evening it out and slowly fading it up, or just, if it's  not looking right, you have to get rid of all of it and just say, screw it, it'll grow  back in two weeks.  I'm not with you, man.  Yeah.  I really think you wanted to do it, and you started, you're like, eh, why not, and just 
[00:58:00]  took it off.  I understand.  You want to be a little like me.  It's not a big deal.  I look good.  And knowing you, you probably already photoshopped your face to see how it would look.  Oh, did you do a little preview?  No, not at all.  Not at all.  You know, you've probably been thinking about this for a while and then said, hmm, I'm going  to photoshop myself with a bald head.  Happy birthday, dear Foundry Music.  Oh, my God.  No, like, I have that whole Lebanese and Italian thing going on, so my hair will grow back in  probably two weeks.  How tall are you?  About six foot.  I didn't know they stacked shit that high. 
[00:58:30]  I'm going to watch it.  I knew that one.  I want that head to be so clean.  You, Pinero, would go in there and take it down.  Be proud to take it down.  Because I record it in stereo, sir.  Call back to yesterday.  Nice.  Oh, very good.  What speaker is that coming out of?  Left side, sir. 
[00:59:00]  What speaker is that coming out of?  Right side, sir.  That's out of phase, private pile.  Pick up your fucking dat machine.  All right.  I was waiting.  I was waiting.  He is listening to us, though.  He now has his shirt untucked these days.  I like it.  The flame hat is a little rebellious, but I like the untucked shirt.  Yeah.  All right.  You didn't give me...  I was waiting for Norton to give me inordinately large amounts of shit, but he didn't.  He didn't.  Because he's bald. 
[00:59:30]  I don't mind.  I think it's a good look.  I don't mind.  But you definitely...  You should shave the face, too.  No.  No.  What's wrong?  What's wrong with having the goatee and the shaved head?  I would like to see it totally...  Nah.  I just...  I look like an infant with the no facial hair.  An infant.  Jesus.  Baby Huey.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  I don't know.  A 300-pound infant.  Yeah.  A baby with hair on its back.  Fucking drinking his hand.  Dude, I would give you $1,000 if you came in with a freaking adult diaper and you shave  your goatee.  Jesus.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Prostitution.  Yeah, exactly.  It would have to be substantially more money than that.  $500 if you suckle.  It would be hilarious.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  The look is interesting.  Thank you.  To say the least.  Get the fuck out of my studio!  There you go.  Yep.  Martini, Steve.  If God wanted an olive in your drink, he'd have miracle in it in there.  We have to step aside again.  All right.  Wow.  We've got commercials we're actually playing. 
[01:00:30]  We're actually running commercials.  I believe so, yeah.  How about that?  So, as we go to break, it's George Bush, Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  It's election day.  Why not?  It's pretty much his speeches.  Some guy put the words to Sunday, Bloody Sunday together just listening to Bush's speeches.  Check it out.  There's been a lot of talk about his next song.  His song is not a rebel song.  His song is Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  I can't believe the news today. 
[01:01:00]  I can't hold my eyes and make it go away.  How long, how long, how long must we sing this song?  How long, too, too, too long, for too long.  Tonight, we can be as one.  Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight.  Broken bottles under children's feet.  Bunnies spin across the dead end streets.  But I won't need the battle hall. 
[01:01:30]  It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  How long, how long must we sing this song? 
[01:02:00]  How long, how long, too, too, too long, for too long.  Tonight, we can be as one.  Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday. 
[01:02:30]  Let's roll.  Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online.  The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember.  Hark, hark, not up.  Wipe the tears from your eyes.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your bloodshot eyes. 
[01:03:00]  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  And it's true, not only  One fact is fiction and TV reality  And today the millions are

[01:06:30]  This channel is experiencing  technical difficulties. Please stand by.  We're working on the problem. 
[01:07:00]  This channel is experiencing  technical difficulties. Please stand  by. We're working on the problem.  Thank you. 
[01:07:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The only way...  The only way you're getting a date is with 
[01:08:00]  a bottle of chloroform.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The only way you're getting a date is with  the Opie and Anthony Show.  I say you don't know.  I say...  Take me out.  I say you don't show.  Don't move time slow.  Don't move time slow. 
[01:08:30]  I say...  Take me out.  I didn't know we had dead air as a sponsor,  everybody.  Dead air.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Spreading across America slowly,  but surely.  They use the old technical difficulties gag.  Remember that when you were watching TV  and the channel would go off?  We're experiencing technical difficulties.  Please stand by.  I guess they use that one.  We're reporting in, Opie.  Reporting in that there was dead air. 
[01:09:00]  Dead air.  And then technical difficulties.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tiny Tim, the trucker.  A lot of truckers checking in today.  Hey, Tiny.  What's up?  Hey, fellas.  I got a truckin' rhyme for you.  All right.  I was born and a back was raised by a bear.  I got a double bone jaw with three coats of hair.  Cast iron balls and a blue steel rod.  I'm a mean motherfucker.  I'm a trucker by God.  Toot toot.  Truckin' up.  He's rapping.  Wait, you guys do that type of thing  when you're on the road?  You sit out here about 3 a.m., 
[01:09:30]  there ain't much to talk about.  You sit out here and talk to yourself  and you come up with some pretty wild stuff.  It's the last thing you hear  before you're just raped and murdered  and left on the side of the road.  Him humming that as he makes you dig  your own shallow grave.  Yeah, we're trying to understand  this whole trucker lifestyle.  You guys are awesome.  You guys do this rhyming thing on the road?  Absolutely.  See, I once do a man named Dave.  He kept this old dead whore in a cave.  I must admit.  Sounds like shit.  Think of the money he saved.  Wow.  All right.  Well, I guess we'll do more trucker rhymes  on the show today.  God help us. 
[01:10:00]  You guys rock.  Keep it up.  Y'all doing fine.  How about this?  I hope you're not an old fuddy-duddy  because I'd sure like to be your good buddy.  Well, they don't call me Tiny Tim for nothing.  All right, Tiny Tim.  Thank you.  All right, y'all.  Have a good one.  And to the rest of the truckers,  that's how you do a phone call.  Is that it?  I know you're lonely on the road, but man, you know, say what you have to say and punch  out Johnny, right?  Punch out Johnny.  Okay.  We got some more Brokaw audio, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  We were touching on this yesterday.  We didn't get to all of it.  And I guess it's Tom Brokaw interviewing President Bush.  President Bush.  President Bush.  President Bush.  Well, Brokaw's all over the place now.  Big election coverage.  Of course, NBC Nightly News, Tom Brokaw.  And he's broadcasting Opie from Democracy Plaza over there at 30 Rockefeller Center.  Used to be called Rockefeller Center.  Used to be called Rockefeller Center.  Now it's Democracy Plaza that he's broadcasting from. 
[01:11:00]  They all need a gimmick.  And their big gimmick this year over at Rockefeller Center, Democracy Plaza.  They got the big skating rink.  There's a map of the United States now embedded in the ice.  On the ice.  People are going to be skating over it, I guess.  And as the returns come in and each candidate wins a state, it'll turn red or blue on this  huge map with some kind of embedded lights, I guess.  And just such gimmicky things they're trying to do to get as many viewers as possible. 
[01:11:30]  Because election coverage is election coverage.  It's not going to change from one channel to the next.  So they try to get these gimmicks.  Gimmicks.  And if that isn't the most gimmicky thing, look at our skating rink in the ice.  A state can turn blue or it'll turn red.  And we can watch a cute little skater.  Maybe see her underwear.  She spins around and around.  That's their little gimmick there at Democracy Plaza.  All right.  Before we play the Tom Brokaw audio, we got another trucker diddy, Anthony. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, great.  Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going today, guys?  All right.  I got a little diddy about your Radio Shack girl.  All right.  It's down in the valley where the Red River flows with a cocksucker's flourish and a  whore-monter's group.  That's where we heard that Radio Shack whore.  She'll roll you, she'll blow you, she'll not your nuts, she'll wrap her legs around you  and squeeze out your guts.  So, Radio Shack whore, we do adore. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, fuck.  I fucked it all up, man.  Is he reading?  You think?  Are you driving a huge piece of machinery and reading?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm sitting still.  You stink!  I'm sorry, man.  That's great.  All right.  I'll get it better next time.  All right.  How about this?  Hey, Chuck, drive your truck and pay your toll.  And in about ten minutes, hit a fucking poll.  No?  All right.  I'm sorry we had a break into our election coverage for that, Anthony. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  We have a black guy from Indiana.  Black guy.  Yeah.  The black guy from Indiana?  All right.  I guess I am the black guy from Indiana.  I'm kept fighting.  And I apologize because I have no idea what your name is.  I mean, it's printed out on the screen.  I mean, I could attempt to say your name.  Kevin Slider.  Kevin Slider.  Kevin Slider.  Oh.  Kevin what?  Just Kevin.  That's good.  That's good.  So why do they spell your name?  K-E-B-S-L-I-E-R.  Wait.  Hold on. 
[01:13:30]  Hold on.  We got Sex Bagel.  With his frosted hair.  Check it in.  Yes, Sex Bagel.  Thank you, sir.  Not what he said.  I said, could you spell it out like three times?  And that's all I got from him.  Yeah.  All right.  Kevin.  Yeah.  All right.  What do you have for the show?  Well, I was just saying that I don't want you guys stealing my language.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't want you guys stealing black people's language from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.  You guys are going to be so pissed off.  This game is going to become massively huge like all the other ones and every white person 
[01:14:00]  in America is going to be speaking black.  And then you guys are going to have to go back to the hood and come up with something  else we could steal.  That's right.  That's right.  I'm going to have to have them come up with like a whole new vocabulary just so that you  guys will be thrown off.  You know what I'm saying?  I hear ya.  All right.  And I just noticed like little Jimmy Norton was being like quiet while you guys were talking  about the election and everything.  I was just wondering if he's not trying to burn any bridges about like trying to get  onto somebody's winning team or something like that. 
[01:14:30]  No, I don't care.  No, Norton's a Bush guy all the way.  Not all the way.  No, no.  I'm pretty much where Ant is.  They didn't put anybody who I could like more.  There was a time that you were saying to me you were thinking of voting for Kerry.  Anthony definitely said that.  I was definitely going to vote for Kerry.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Cool.  I'll talk to you later.  I flip-flopped.  Holla.  I guess I flip-flopped.  Holla might be an old term now.  No, no, no.  It's a holla.  It's very hip.  Yeah.  All right, Anthony. 
[01:15:00]  So we got the audio.  We should get right to it.  It's Tom Brokaw.  Oh, listening to his strange speech again.  Struggling.  Struggling.  Begging for air.  And then running out of air.  It's just such a chore to get those words out of.  So here's Tom Brokaw, everyone.  All right.  Tom Brokaw has just returned from a morning with President Bush in Florida.  Tom.  Brian, I caught up with the President today in a state that was so pivotal to him four years  ago.  And with its 27 electoral votes, Florida continues to be territory that both campaigns are targeting. 
[01:15:30]  In all, the President attended three rallies in Florida today, including this one in Tampa.  Did he say free rallies instead of three?  Free rallies.  This one in Tampa.  That's right.  I caught up with the President today.  It was kind of rough because he was in the limousine and I was running.  I was on foot so I'm a little out of breath chasing the President's limousine.  But I did catch up with him. 
[01:16:00]  We had breakfast of coffee and croissants in our hotel room.  It was wonderfully romantic.  Were you guys watching chick flicks?  Watching chick flicks.  I enjoy steel magnolias, but the President, surprisingly enough, likes five green tomatoes.  We couldn't choose between the two, so we settled on bridges of Madison County.  Yeah.  Where the photographer is taking pictures of the bridges of Madison County.  That would be Clint Eastwood.  Clint. 
[01:16:30]  Clint.  Clint Eastwood.  Clint.  Clint Eastwood.  C-L-L-  Clint.  Where Dirty Harry is taking pictures of the bridges of Madison County.  And it's a wonderful love story about him and a woman.  A wonderful what story?  A love story.  A what?  It seems like you have problems with L's.  A story about a man and a woman falling in love.  In what?  I don't know.  Love. 
[01:17:00]  Love?  Great adoration for each other.  That's what they were doing as he was taking pictures of the bridges of Madison County.  That's such a romantic scene of him bathing himself by a pump.  You like that scene?  That was very romantic.  It was.  As Meryl?  As Meryl Streep.  Oh, you saw.  Meryl Streep.  You said Meryl pretty good there.  Out of the window.  Overlooking.  Yeah, moaning softly to herself.  Overlooking Dirty Harry.  Slightly touching herself.  And she's gently brushing her nipples through her little nightie. 
[01:17:30]  It's quite exciting.  And we watched.  Me and the President.  After.  That was before I asked him questions about his tax cunts.  Tax cunts.  No, it's cuts.  Tax cunts.  That's what I said.  Tax.  Tax cunts.  Cuts.  The President's tax cunts.  It's only to the rich though.  He gave the rich so many tax cunts.  A lot of people are saying that now the burden is tax burden is more on the people, 
[01:18:00]  the middle and lower.  Middle.  Middle of?  Middle and lower.  No.  Sub-middle class.  I'm trying to figure out what you're saying.  Middle class America?  Middle class America and the lower, lower, lower, slightly below middle class  and gave the rich people all the...  Ah!  All right.  So we discussed that. 
[01:18:30]  Do we have the clip of the actual town broke off?  Oh, I love the tax cunts one.  Saying tax cunts.  Yeah, I've got to pull that one up somewhere.  They're going to try to find it real fast.  We're polling New York City today, Anthony.  We've got Nathaniel back on the line.  Nathaniel!  I just lost my guy.  He just turned silent on me.  All right.  Ah.  All right.  Well, find another guy.  I'll keep looking.  All right.  Here is Democracy Plaza, where I'm sitting in my freedom chair at Liberty Desk. 
[01:19:00]  It's so patriotic I could puke.  But I will be covering the election.  All right.  Well, we want to get to the audio of you talking to the president of the United States.  Me talking to Bush after we watched Bridget and Mack.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Found the president today to be upbeat and determined to stay the course as he defended  his record in managing the economy, the fight against Osama bin Laden, and the war in Iraq.  Our conversation began early this morning on board Air Force One.  Listen, I have a favorite theory in American politics that the unforeseen will occur, the UFO 
[01:19:30]  theory, I call it.  Do you think there's any UFO between now and Tuesday morning?  I do not.  I think that the people who understand the stakes of this election, that we're in a war,  that the American president must lead in a war on terror.  People are sorting through who's got the best strategy to conduct everywhere.  Of course, I'm making the case I do.  The UFO theory.  Yes, the president didn't quite understand the UFO theory that I pushed forth for him. 
[01:20:00]  That's a brilliant theory, Mr. Brokaw.  It's quite a brilliant theory.  UFO theory is where Mulder and Scully travel to Africa, and they find it buried on the coastline  of the beach.  And it's a fabulous story of a cigarette smoking man and a jeep throat.  So, the UFO theory, and just then, Air Force One flew into the Bermuda Triangle, the Bermuda  Trapezoid, with a pointy tip instead of a flat one. 
[01:20:30]  Can I say that?  Do you understand what I'm saying there?  I understand, yeah.  I love geometry.  And it flew in and we disappeared.  And all of a sudden, that's when the UFO theory happened.  And we looked and saw a cigar-shaped object that forced Air Force One down.  And it gave me and the president an anal probe.  You got an anal probe?  I got an anal probe with the president of the United States of America.  From an alien?  From an alien ship.  It was the UFO theory is what I call it. 
[01:21:00]  The UFO theory.  How did that probe work out for you?  It was quite wonderful indeed.  I enjoyed it.  It was watching George W. sitting down next to me as I enjoyed my anal probe.  I actually call it a liberty probe because it was very patriotic.  Actually, when it was hanging out my ass, they put a little flag on it to remind us that  we live in a free nation, even if we are getting things shoved in our ass.  The president was very happy with that, happy with his anal probe, felt good about it, actually 
[01:21:30]  gave it a smile and a thumbs up for the front page of all the paper.  Said he was the brave candidate, brave enough to get an anal probe, and John Kerry indeed  was not brave enough to get an anal probe.  Takes a real man to get an anal probe, huh?  It certainly does.  Especially after watching Bridges of Madison County and having oral sex with the president. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, I didn't bring that up?  You had oral sex with the president.  It wasn't gay or nothing.  The joke is on the president because I'm not even gay.  What did Norton once say?  It's not gay if you don't push back?  Yep.  Look at Norton.  Yeah.  All proud.  Yep.  That's what I said.  I stand by that theory, too, like I do the UFO theory.  Tom, we've got to interrupt this coverage for another trucker rhyme. 
[01:22:30]  Let's say hi to Floyd in Atlanta.  Hey, Floyd.  What's going on, guys?  Floyd.  How are you, Floyd?  Pretty good.  How y'all doing?  Pretty good.  I got a trucker rhyme.  If you're driving a truck, you're just a poor dumb fuck.  So move the hell over so I can pass or mash your freaking gas.  All right.  I think we're going to end the trucker rhyme bit for today.  I wanted to say something else, too, if I may.  The guy that called in earlier about the 16-year thing with the stat that tied in with the Redskins 
[01:23:00]  and the incumbent candidate leaving office.  Yeah.  That's only three elections, man.  Clinton had to leave in 2000.  So, I mean, how does that hold water?  That's a bunch of bullshit.  It sucks.  Yeah.  It sucks.  This really does suck.  It sucks.  All right, Floyd.  Keep up the good work, guys.  Hey, Floyd.  Didn't you get the hint when I hung up on you?  Did you do that?  Yeah.  I didn't want to go with the Redskins theory. 
[01:23:30]  That's why I hung up on you.  Oh, well.  That was like a note.  I thought I lost my signal, but, you know, anyway.  No, that was me.  There's times we just hang up on people because we can't be polite here.  You know, sometimes you just got to clear some of the phone lines, and you were sitting  there all hoping that you could add to that Washington Redskins theory, and it was a who  cares phone call.  So I got rid of it.  But you felt it was so great, you had to call back with a rhyme to get back to your original  point, you bastard.  Hey, hey, hey.  I know that you were told by whoever was doing the call that that happened. 
[01:24:00]  You didn't hang up on me, man.  Come on now.  No, I wouldn't hang up on you, right?  All right.  Thank you.  Sometimes we just hang up on you guys.  Just take your beating and move on, all right?  Yeah, those little poems, those little raps that they're doing.  That seemed like a good idea at the time, Anthony.  Yeesh.  They're kind of growing on me, though.  Are they?  Yeah.  I like that one.  And mash and gas?  Yeah.  That didn't quite work out.  That was horrendous.  We might have one of our interns checking in from the streets of New York.  Let's go right to the phone.  Who's this?  Yo, yo, yo.  Who's this? 
[01:24:30]  Hey, this is Danny, the intern.  Oh, Danny, what's up?  You're the one that came in to work with a blazer today, right?  Oh, yeah.  I'm wearing the full suit.  Yeah, full suit.  This guy wants us to notice him, Anthony.  He was the one that came in with the Oompa Loompa t-shirt.  Yeah, it's very professional.  It's very funny, the contrast.  One intern showed up today looking like a wigger, and you came in in a full suit.  Well, actually, Eric had told me yesterday that I should wear a suit so I could look all  professional for the Regis crowd.  Doesn't matter, though.  It just fits you so nicely.  I mean, it shows off your shoulders and your tapered little, you know, your tapered torso 
[01:25:00]  and the shape of your legs looks good.  All right, so you're at the Regis crowd there?  Yeah, I just got to the Regis crowd.  We got some people online here.  Okay.  And I guess I'll be asking them about the election.  Do you notice one thing about the Regis crowd?  They're all the same person.  Yeah, pretty much.  They all look like they're from, like, Idaho or somewhere.  I was going to say, they all look like they're from the Midwest, and they all look like they  like to eat.  That's about all you see on that line every morning outside Regis. 
[01:25:30]  All right, go ahead, bro.  Let's see what you got.  All right, hold on.  Let me find somebody good for you guys.  I'll talk to a fatty.  Hold on.  Excuse me, can I ask you some questions for XM Satellite Radio?  What?  XM Satellite Radio?  Yes.  Okay, are you going to be voting in the election today?  No, I voted for it.  I'm here.  I'm in Tennessee.  You're in Tennessee?  I can't vote.  So what are you going to do about voting today?  I already did.  Who'd you vote for?  I know.  I don't tell that. 
[01:26:00]  Why not?  All right, no one knows.  What's with the secret ballot thing?  No, I don't know who you are.  Hey, give her the phone.  All right, she doesn't really want to talk to me about who she voted for.  Wait, give her the phone, though.  Give her the phone.  Hold on, wait.  You want me to just give it to her?  Yeah, yeah.  All right, hold on.  They want to talk to you.  It's Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio.  Hello.  Hey, who's this?  Hey.  I can't hear you.  Who are you?  Who am I?  Yeah, what's your name?  Yeah, what's your name?  I'm just a nice little lady standing on the side of the street trying to get in to see 
[01:26:30]  Regis.  Yeah, you want to see Regis.  You want to bring your Fat Waffle Torso in to see the Regis show?  That's all.  Hello?  Can you hear me?  I am.  What's your name, Tennessee lady?  Oh, I got it now.  Sam.  Huh?  Sam.  Sam?  Your name's Sam?  Yes.  And you see the fine young gentleman that gave you the phone?  Yes.  You are the winner.  We told him to give the phone to the fattest, ugliest person he could find. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, good.  He found me.  He did, did he?  Yeah, he found me.  If you were looking for the fattest, ugliest person, then he found me.  It worked out real good, don't you think?  Yes.  Yeah, we do think that, yes.  Tell him to give you your prize.  I get a prize for being the fattest, ugliest?  Okay.  Okay.  I've got no problem with that, do you?  No.  Well, I guess not. 
[01:27:30]  Why did he pick you, though?  Yeah, why did he pick you?  How many people are online?  Oh, I don't know.  About 50 or so.  I was the fattest, ugliest, so he picked me.  50 people and he decided you were the fattest, ugliest person?  Well, yeah.  Wow.  All right, look around.  Do you think anyone's fatter and uglier than you?  Oh, no, no one.  No?  And I do wear that sign that says I'm the fattest, ugliest person in the line.  Well, how much do you weigh there, Sam?  Oh, I think it's about 4'10 now.  What? 
[01:28:00]  4'10.  No, how much do you weigh?  4'10.  4'10.  Oh, I thought that's how tall you are.  You're 410 pounds?  410 pounds is what I weigh.  No, I don't believe that.  Does your hubby still F you?  I'm 5'9, yeah.  My husband's with me and he weighs 7,000 pounds.  Well, why don't you tell your husband that that guy dressed in a blazer was told to pick  out the fattest, ugliest person online today.  See what he says.  He's right here hearing it.  Oh, he is?  Is he happy about that? 
[01:28:30]  I'm sure that you know that he was supposed to pick out the fattest, ugliest person in  line and he picked out me.  Do you have a problem with that?  I do.  My sister's taking offense to it, but my husband doesn't mind.  Your sister's what?  My sister's taking offense to what you said, but my husband doesn't mind.  Why is she taking offense to it?  She's just that way.  Well, how much does she weigh?  She weighs 60 pounds.  She's thin? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, she weighs 60.  I know she doesn't weigh 60 pounds.  How much does she weigh?  You know, really.  You're trying to be wacky.  It's not working.  You guys make the number 10 as you're standing on line now.  You know that?  Huh?  You really need to get a life.  Who, me?  Oh, no.  Miss, please, with such harsh language.  Thanks a lot, guys.  How much does...  Is she fat or what?  Um, she's pretty pumped.  All right.  All right.  See if you can get another victim, all right? 
[01:29:30]  And we'll check in with you in a little bit.  Well, now that half the line heard that, it's going to be a little tough.  Yeah, I guess so.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Okay, okay.  All right.  I was dying to steal that, but that's Jimmy's gag, man.  That's a great gag.  All right.  We should take a break.  You could tell in her voice.  She was like...  She was trying to be cool, but you could just tell.  She was trying to play it off.  Oh, like, it don't bother me, none.  There was a knife wound right through her fat kidneys.  It bothers me every day of my life. 
[01:30:00]  It don't bother me, none.  Oh, what?  You were supposed to pick out the fattest, ugliest person on the line?  And that's me.  He sure picked...  I've been haunted by this since childhood.  Why did you rub it in?  I just wanted to see Regis.  I didn't think I'd be mocked because everyone here online looks just like me.  I was together with my kin in fatness.  Everything's fine.  I don't care.  Oh, my husband, no, my sister took offense at her.  She's the thin one.  I've always hated her. 
[01:30:30]  Ah, Christ.  That's classic.  All right, let's say hi to Paul in Jersey before we take a break.  Hey, Paul.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right, what do you got?  I got a rhyme for all those truck drivers.  Okay.  Dickery dickery duck.  Drive your fucking truck.  Shut up, you stupid ass.  We don't give a shit.  Hit the gas.  We don't give a fuck.  He throws in.  Push it out.  Punch it out.  And we're going to punch out.  That stunk, Paul.  And we'll continue with the brokaw audio in just a bit. 
[01:31:00]  Also, on the way, the 50 greatest chick flicks of all time.  Now, I've tallied up how many I've seen.  Explain what's going on because maybe people are tuning in for the first time today.  This is actually going to turn out to be pretty fun.  We have a list of the 50, the top 50 chick flicks of all time.  Top 50.  And it's compiled by that retard Oprah magazine.  So you know it's going to be real chicky.  And we want to see which one of us has seen the most of these top 50 movies. 
[01:31:30]  I've already tallied my score up.  Is it ugly?  How many of the movies I've seen.  I don't know.  Okay.  I don't know.  It might be based on what everyone else says.  I have this feeling, though, that you.  Oh, my God.  Norton's been highlighting.  Dude.  Oh, boy.  You've got problems over there.  Why not?  I'm trying to be.  I haven't had much so far this show.  So I figure if I highlight, I'll be ready for this bit.  All right.  All right.  I tallied mine up.  And I think.  I got to think you've seen more than I have.  You have.  I don't know about that.  I know you used to get dragged to the movies a lot, Opie. 
[01:32:00]  Man, the stories you used to tell.  And I will get into it in a few minutes here.  Sandy would take you to movies, and you'd come back like, oh, my God, what I had to  see last night.  Side bet?  All right.  A little side bet.  I'm not very confident.  I'm not too confident about it.  I'll be completely honest with you.  A little side bet.  Okay.  I think I've seen less chick flicks than you.  Really?  According to this list.  We're going just on this list.  And there's a controversy in the list that I don't agree with.  Well, that's fine. 
[01:32:30]  We could battle it out a little bit.  There's a chick flick in there that isn't a chick flick.  $20?  $20?  A little $20.  That's like lunch money.  Let's go for some lunch money today, okay?  What's the bet?  And I think...  He got zapped.  And I have a little side bet.  A little side bet.  I think he's seen more chick flicks on this list than I have.  Yeah, I think so, too.  I think the overall winner today, though, is going to be Steve.  Yeah, Steve.  Or Private Pile, as we like to call him now.  How many chick flicks have you seen? 
[01:33:00]  So, I'm going to tally up my total during the commercials here, Anthony.  All right.  Okay.  Tally it up.  And we'll get back to some more of the bro-call audio in just a bit here, so...  Come on!  Woo!  Booyah!  Check this out!  Raw!  I kick it!  In the hizzy!  I kick it old schoolie!  Just, uh...  Word up!  Hey, jerk face!  Hey, jerk face!  You feel me?  Waka, waka, waka!

Hi, yes.  Are you currently working downtown?  Yes.  Well, actually, I was cutting hair uptown. 
[01:35:30]  And now I want to get there because I see what you say about the Wall Street thing there.  Right.  I could probably bring in a lot of clientele.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll be interviewing all next week.  Okay, great.  Listen, what about styles?  What kind of styles are you looking for?  We do everything.  Right.  All right, look.  I'm pretty far out there.  I've done some wacky shit.  I used to shoot people's heads up with Novocaine and carve grooves in their head. 
[01:36:00]  I mean, if that's too far-fetched, you got to let me know.  Well, first of all, we work on Wall Street, so the people here aren't going to be that wild.  Right, right.  I did a lot of work in the village, man.  I'm a fucking...  I'm crazy.  I'm a nut job.  One time I gave this guy a haircut.  He didn't like it.  He kicked my fucking ass all over.  If you want to come in one day next week, I'll be glad to see you.  Right, right.  As long as my appearance wouldn't bother you.  I'm carved from head to toe.  I'm a lunatic.  But I'll come in, and we'll shoot the shit, and you can see some of my work. 
[01:36:30]  Okay?  No problem.  Do you want us to find him one day next week?  Whatever's fine.  Listen, I'll bring my children down.  I carved the shit out of their heads, too.  But it looks good.  It looks good.  You never heard of that before?  Excuse me?  Did you ever hear of that procedure?  Yes.  Is that something or what?  Oh, I don't think anyone down here would want that done, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.  All right, great.  Well, I'll come down, and you can show me your shit, and maybe kick me around the office a little, and we'll throw ideas back and forth. 
[01:37:00]  Okay?  Very.  You want my address?  Yes, please.  All right.  We're at the trade center.  Oh, holy shit.  All right.  Okay, I'll see you then.  I'll see you what?  Wednesday?  Next week?  Wednesday is fine.  Okay.  I'm so happy.  Bye-bye now.  Okay.  See you then.  Bye-bye.  XM70, the real jazz channel, presents  In the Swing Seat, with Wynton Marsalis.

[01:38:00]  Oops!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Now this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me,  cause we need a little controversy, cause it feels so guilty without me.  I said this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me,  and it's taking a little controversy, cause it feels so guilty without me.  Mr. Brokaw, I didn't know you were into M&M.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I love M&M.  You love the M&M, huh?  They're going to feel so empty without me at NBC Nightly News. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, you're about to retire there, sir.  Tom Brokaw, retiring from NBC Nightly News.  This is my last erection that I'm going to be hosting.  No more erections after this one.  You're not going to comment on the fact that I said erections?  I thought you were going to work with me on that one.  Nothing?  I was a little distracted, because we have Danny.  He's back at the Regis line.  Mr. Brokaw. 
[01:39:00]  Let's say hi to Danny again.  He's working the Regis line, seeing who people are voting for today.  Danny, what's going on?  I'm sorry.  How's it going, guys?  How are you?  There he is.  What's up, Danny?  Well, I was online at Regis and Kelly.  I ran into two beautiful ladies, and right now I'm in the middle of Starbucks,  because they asked me if they could get some coffee, because you guys were in break.  Are they beautiful, beautiful, or are they beautiful?  They're very, very attractive-looking women.  Really?  Really. 
[01:39:30]  They're not pigs?  I'm sorry?  Are they not pigs?  No, no, no, no.  Say uh-huh if they're pigs.  The guys, we're on live with Opie and Anthony right now.  Uh-huh.  They want to know if they're pigs.  Pigs.  Because I'm trying to tell them how attractive you guys are, and they don't believe me.  They're not pigs.  Not at all.  Where are they from, and who are they voting for?  Definitely not a pig.  There you have it. 
[01:40:00]  Who are they voting for, Danny?  Now, who are you guys voting for today?  Bush.  Bush.  Why Bush?  Why Bush?  They're Republicans.  They're Republicans.  Hmm.  All right.  And where are they from?  One's from L.A. and one's from D.C.  Wow.  That's a little strange.  Yeah, you usually get Democrats there.  Now, Danny, you've got to work with us here.  Are they really hot?  They're all right.  They're not bad.  They're very, very nice.  Dude, you've got to find the pigs, man.  This bit doesn't work if they're almost hot. 
[01:40:30]  We don't like hot chicks.  Well, maybe Jimmy could say something to them.  No, you've got to go back on that line and find the pigs for us.  Makes this bit much more fun.  All right.  I'll, uh...  Much more fun.  Oh, you want to talk to them?  All right.  Jimmy wants to talk to...  Oh, no.  Jimmy would like you to give the phone to one of the fine young ladies.  Okay.  Hold on.  All right.  All right.  Jim Norton would like to speak with you, if that's all right.  Hello?  Hello. 
[01:41:00]  So, you're voting for Bush today?  Yeah.  Where are you from?  I'm sorry.  I heard, but I couldn't hear because I was...  I'm from Washington, D.C.  Oh, okay.  And what is it about Bush that you like?  We're trying to find out what it is that women are looking for.  What is it about Bush?  Um, I just think he...  I feel like, um, I'm awful on the radio.  No, no, no.  You sound good so far.  Um, I feel like he means...  Shut up.  He has a lot of heart and he means what he said. 
[01:41:30]  And that he cares.  Stupid.  And I feel like Kerry...  All right.  But I feel like Kerry would run for president of Russia.  You're saying nothing.  I think he just wants the position, but not...  To me, it feels like he doesn't really care.  But what about...  Now, that's what a lot of people have said about Kerry.  Do you feel that Bush with terrorism is a little bit better, or do you feel that  Kerry would be more effective in dealing with our European allies?  Um, I...  I honestly can't say that I...  I'm a cock in your mouth.  I'm very from... 
[01:42:00]  No, exactly what I'm talking about.  Oh, my God.  Right, right, right.  You don't know at all.  Now, what is it about Bush's foreign policy that you like and don't like?  Um...  I mean, you are voting, after all.  You should know these issues.  Mm-hmm.  That are in...  Where do you stand on the stem cell research thing?  Oh, good one.  Thank you.  Actually, that is the one thing about Bush that I'm...  Shut up.  I worked with diabetes children this summer, and that is the one thing that I don't like  about Bush. 
[01:42:30]  So you're for stem cell research?  Yes, 100%.  You're saying that you're for...  You work with diabetes children, and you think that research should be done on them?  No, no.  On the...  I'm not sure what you're saying.  That's not really right.  Yeah, how does this stem cell research thing work?  It's a very important issue in this election.  I understand.  I feel like, um... 
[01:43:00]  With stem cell research, it's a way for them to find a cure for...  It's diseases like diabetes, and...  No, I'm very forced to stem cell research, but...  Would it be easier to get a diabetes kid to lick your mule if you put sugar on it?  Excuse me?  Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hello?  Wow.  It sounds like your brain's going to explode.  You all right?  Okay.  You think it's probably not.  She just had to move the phone and said that you were being very obnoxious. 
[01:43:30]  Why?  I wasn't being obnoxious.  Not at all.  We were getting to the heart of the issues today.  It's our election coverage.  Oh, my God.  The phone lines are going berserk.  They certainly are.  She seemed like she was going to have a stroke.  She's telling me to stem cell research, go.  Empty.  Poor girl.  I work with kids.  Shut up.  You know, Danny, that one kind of worked.  So continue, okay?  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Find another dummy.  You got it.  All right. 
[01:44:00]  Another dummy.  Let's go back to the Tom Brokaw audio, Anthony.  It's our election coverage here on the O&A show.  It's Brokaw with his exclusive interview with President Bush.  Later, the president sat down with me for an extended interview.  Mr. President, Osama bin Laden is back on videotape.  At least you have been using his appearance as a demonstration that this war on terror is  still underway.  Other people see it, however, as here he is, the mastermind of the 9-11 attacks, still taunting  America, still making threats against this country. 
[01:44:30]  How can the fact that he is alive and at large be seen as anything other than a failure of the administration?  Well, first, he's not going to intimidate or decide this election.  And secondly, we are system...  And secondly, what was that word you were trying to say?  Tell me, as good as...  I'm a Lama Ding Dong.  What the hell did he even say there?  I have no idea.  Live and at large. 
[01:45:00]  Live at large.  Are you kidding?  You got that out of that?  There's a lot of L's in that sentence.  Live and at large.  Live and at large?  At large.  Can you realize it?  Destroying Al-Qaeda.  They had a broad network.  They had been training for years in Afghanistan.  And because we've taken decisive action, Al-Qaeda is being dismantled.  And we'll eventually get Osama bin Laden.  In the meantime, we're destroying his network.  Slowly but surely, systematically destroying him. 
[01:45:30]  Mr. Brokaw, can you say slowly but surely?  Slowly but surely.  Slowly I turn, step by step, inch by inch.  Osama bin Laden.  I would tell him, go fly Al-Qaeda.  See, you get it?  It's like, go fly Al-Qaeda, but it's Al-Qaeda.  Mr. President, with Osama bin Laden being at large.  At what?  At what?  Missing.  Missing. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, missing.  Okay.  What are you going to do to capture him?  Are you going to search the caves of, oh, brother, Afghanistan and the hills of Tora Bora, Tora Bora, Tora Bora, Tora Bora, my exclusive interview with the President of the United States.  Yeah.  George.  Let's go back to the audio. 
[01:46:30]  But he has lieutenants that we had not heard of three years ago.  Zarqawi, for example, in Iraq, who's leading the exergency there.  The exergency.  There's the Hakawe Indians, right?  Aren't you hunting the Hakawe Indians from F Troop?  You're searching there.  I heard him.  I heard.  I just asked a question about the Hakawe Indians.  Yeah.  Or Zarqawi, who? 
[01:47:00]  I couldn't understand my own question.  A much too effective fashion for the safety of the United States troops.  Well, Zarqawi was in Afghanistan.  The history of Zarqawi is illustrative of this war on terror.  Zarqawi was running a training camp in Afghanistan until we arrived and destroyed the camp.  Zarqawi is a bad guy.  We'll get him eventually as well.  But Zarqawi was training before we took any action.  I mean, I've heard some say, well, the actions of the United States have created terrorists. 
[01:47:30]  Zarqawi was a terrorist long before I got elected.  Zarqawi Indians from F Troop.  I believe Agarn was sent over there to give him some booze.  And since the Indians like to drink, they never even attacked F Troop.  They left them alone.  Is this your F Troop theory?  But this is my F Troop theory because President Bush is talking about the Hakawe Indians.  And for some reason, they never attacked the fort of F Troop because they were drunk Indians that enjoyed the booze that F Troop would bring over. 
[01:48:00]  That Agarn, what a scream, President Bush.  Isn't he so funny to watch?  And that Wrangler Jane.  Yeah.  Very attractive, blonde-haired woman.  He certainly is.  Who, if you really thought about it, would probably be ravaged in such an environment.  Just hang out with soldiers all day and all night that were threatened by drunken Indians.  Probably get pounded on an eveningly basis. 
[01:48:30]  Eveningly.  All right.  We have to go back to the Regis line, Mr. Brokaw.  I think you need a breath anyway.  Suck on some oxygen.  We'll get back to you.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, so what have we got now?  Well, I'm in front of the Regis and Kathie Lee show.  Unfortunately, the majority of the line has already gone inside to get that security and stuff.  You do realize it's now called Regis and Kelly.  Oh, right.  Kathie Lee?  What are you, Kathie Lee?  I'm a gigantic ass, but you guys know. 
[01:49:00]  You're really up on things, aren't you?  All right.  Well, that guy watch it all the time, right?  Yeah, I was watching Johnny Carson last night.  And I love that Ed McMahon sidekick he's got.  There you have.  But I did manage to find some hangers back.  So hold on one second.  My man, what's your name?  Tim.  Tim.  I have Tim here, and I'm sure he'll be more than happy to help you out with your election  coverage today.  All right.  Let's talk to Tim.  Hold on.  Hello?  Hey, Tim.  Where are you from?  Originally from Cleveland, but I live here in Manhattan. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  And who are you voting for today?  For President?  Kerry.  Kerry.  Okay.  And why?  Why?  Yes.  Bottom line, it boils down to me, is gay marriage.  I think that Bush is a member of a religious Christian sect that has a giant problem with homosexuality,  and I don't think that's right.  Do you realize that Kerry is not for gay marriage?  Yes, I do.  However, I think he's the lesser of two evils, is what it boils down to.  Hey, I would think the hiv would be the, like, top of the two evils. 
[01:50:00]  Danny.  Danny.  Oh, no, not, what's his name?  What's his name?  What?  My name's Tim.  Oh, Tim.  Oh, sorry, Tim.  Tim, is it gay if you don't push back?  Is it gay if you don't push back?  That's what Jimmy says.  Yeah, we're trying to, you know, figure that out today.  What exactly is pushing back?  What I'm saying is, if I'm on the receiving end of, say, a mule assault, and I stand there  and just kind of take my medicine, is it gay if I'm not pushing my hips back and kind 
[01:50:30]  of anticipating and helping?  Yes, that would make you a giant homosexual.  That's gay.  No, it's gay if you push back, but it's not gay if you don't, right?  I'm saying if I don't push back, you might just kind of stand there.  No, no, bottom line, if there's something in your rear, you're gay.  Bottom line.  That's what I was saying.  You're kind of gay.  All right.  You've got to admit it, boys.  More importantly, why are you going to see Regis and Kelly?  Because one of my best friends has her mother and her friend in town, and they are here  from Michigan, and they wanted to go see it. 
[01:51:00]  And I'm now wanting to turn down something for free.  Tell you what.  All right.  You told us, I guess.  All right.  Well, thank you, Tim.  You're welcome.  All right.  There he goes.  Tim, did you have any other questions for Tim?  You friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something?  Do I have questions for Tim?  Yeah.  Why do you like dicks in your mouth, Tim?  You kissed a guy?  In my defense, it was dark, and he was a very pretty guy.  There you go.  Danny, good job.  Yeah, sorry.  I thought I was at the parade again from Sunday.  All right.  Anyone else in the area? 
[01:51:30]  You know, not really.  It's pretty dry over here now.  All right.  I'm going to go to your partner in crime, Nathaniel.  He's on the Tony Danza line.  Oh.  Whoa.  Let's go to Nathaniel.  It's the same line, by the way.  They filmed both shows at the same place.  Really?  Nathaniel.  Yes.  The line is forming for Tony Danza now?  Looks like it, yeah.  All right.  And who do you have in front of you?  I have a lovely couple here.  A guy and a girl.  Yeah.  How lovely?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You guys got to work with us a little bit.  How lovely are they? 
[01:52:00]  Is she a mess?  That might have been kind of me.  Is she a mess?  No.  On the scale of one to ten?  Oh, good.  Now or?  Find me a mess.  Okay.  Are there any messes?  We'll be nice to them.  I want to find a mess, though.  All right.  I mean, not really a mess, no.  Not really a mess?  No.  Give us a number.  One to ten.  Now or 20 years ago, is what I'm saying. 
[01:52:30]  20 years ago.  Oh, she's an old broad?  How about now?  Now.  Four.  She's an older broad?  Yeah.  How old would you put her?  Above 50?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  She's above 50 and she's a four?  Yeah.  Maybe a six.  Well, to a youngster like him.  And she's with her husband?  Yeah.  You guys want to talk to her?  Can they hear you?  Um, sort of wandering.  They have no idea that you're talking about them, though, right? 
[01:53:00]  Hopefully not.  All right.  Put her on.  Yeah.  Let's put the old bag on.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  All right.  Here you go.  That'd be bad.  All right.  Hello.  Hello.  How are you?  Fine.  How are you?  Where are you from?  I'm from Connecticut.  And who are you voting for today?  I voted for Bush.  And why did you vote for Bush?  I just feel the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know.  Ah.  We're in the middle of a crisis.  And you don't want to change hands in the middle of a crisis. 
[01:53:30]  Change hands.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did that Osama Bin Laden tape influence your vote?  Absolutely not.  It didn't make any difference.  Is it an absolute guess to think about it?  Although, no, I think that if it did sway your vote, you're wrong.  Because if you let that man control your mind.  He has mind control now.  Yeah.  Yeah, very good.  I read about that.  You watch TV good. 
[01:54:00]  I read about that.  You're good.  You're a good TV watcher.  I work 12 hours a day.  I only read.  Quiet.  Yeah.  And I make up my own mind.  Shut up!  Shut up!  I have three daughters.  I have three daughters.  Stop whining.  And I'm encouraging them all to vote.  Stop it!  How old are they?  I have an 18-year-old.  Oh, wow.  How hot is she?  21-year-old.  Yeah.  She's adorable.  Nice.  And they're all beautiful.  21 and 23.  Wow.  They're all gorgeous.  Congratulations to you. 
[01:54:30]  Get her used to the dancing clapping.  Excuse me, any unwanted pregnancies so far?  Not that I know of.  That's a good thing.  Not to be personal.  We love babies and dogs.  You know what?  I'm a free spirit.  I've always been.  I'm a flower child.  Not to be personal, but are you over the age of 65?  No.  We told Danny to get somebody, Nathaniel, to get somebody who is over the age of 65.  Well, I'm going to throw my bag at him if he thinks I'm over 65. 
[01:55:00]  Well, we told him to find someone over 65 because we're trying to see.  We want to know how the senior citizens are voting.  Oh, then you want my boyfriend.  How old is he?  He's...  He must look 65 if he handed you the phone.  I don't really understand this.  I look awesome.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, no, no.  No disrespect intended.  We told him to find the oldest woman online.  Oh, goodbye. 
[01:55:30]  Have a great day.  You too.  You too.  Enjoy Tony Danza.  Oh, thanks.  I don't even know who he is.  Like I said, I work every day.  I've never seen the show.  So why the hell are you going to see it?  Oh, it's a happening, you know.  It's a reason for a day off.  Last week I was in Italy.  This week, Tony Danza.  If you want to know who Tony Danza is, picture any cast member of The Sopranos with Down Syndrome.  I love it.  What a visual.  Goodbye.  Bye.  All right.  There she goes.  Yeah, bye.  We have to say hi to Lady Di. 
[01:56:00]  What's up, Lady Di?  Hi.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Look at her all hungover.  All right, hold on one second.  We're jumping all over the place.  Chris from Buffalo.  Real fast.  Go.  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey.  Ann, you got to get one of these fat pigs on the line and do Tony and tell her they won  tickets to something.  Oh, my God.  Or they're going to bring it on stage.  Yeah.  Or do something.  Screw them.  See, I thought the guy might have a good idea.  Let's see if they'll buy your Tony Danza impression.  That's a good one.  Very good.  Thank you, bro.  All right.  Now back to Lady Di, who's hungover and she just woke up. 
[01:56:30]  Hey, Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Yeah, I'm right here.  I know.  You just woke up?  Yeah, I did.  Are you hungover today?  What?  Are you hungover?  No, I'm not hungover.  What do you mean am I hungover?  No, I'm not.  Well, somebody who drinks on a daily basis usually wakes up a little hungover.  No.  What are you listening to in the background?  I'm not listening to anything.  It's my friend that's listening to Day Tripper. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, yeah, the Beatles.  I heard it.  Your friend?  Who is this?  Did you get banged last night?  No.  Well, then what friend do you have over so early?  I have one of my friends over here.  A guy?  Yeah.  It's a boyfriend?  No, it's not a boyfriend.  Is it a guy?  Yeah, it's a guy.  All right.  But you're having a boyfriend.  Get him on the phone, please.  Hold on one second.  Thank you.  All right. 
[01:57:30]  Lady Di is just waking up.  She needs a job, and I guess she's going to start her job search soon.  Let's see what this is all about.  Yeah, definitely.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Lady Di, are you going to find...  Howie?  Howie?  Howie.  Oh, me and Lady Di were hanging out all night.  I threw her a good one.  Hey.  Hey, Howie.  What's up?  What's up, brother?  How do you know Lady Di?  From a friend.  What do you mean, from a friend?  My friend Chris knows.  Did you sleep over there last night? 
[01:58:00]  I know her.  Did you sleep over last night?  Oh, yeah.  I'm here for a while.  You're here for a while.  Why?  Why not?  So you're just hanging out over at her place?  Yeah, we're hanging out.  Having a good time.  All right, Howie.  Be honest.  Did you guys have some action last night?  Did we have what?  Action.  A little action.  No.  Why not?  I ain't dealing with that.  I got action with other girls.  I ain't dealing with that.  Why wouldn't you deal with that with Lady Di?  Oh, I have standards. 
[01:58:30]  How does she look in the morning?  Not good.  He's freeloading off of her and he's bashing her.  What?  Dude, you're freeloading off of her?  Why would you want to be at Lady Di's house this morning?  I'm not freeloading.  I'm just here for a party and having a good time.  When did the party start?  When?  Yeah.  Yesterday.  And it's just a party with you two?  No, my friend Chris.  And why is Chris there?  Why is Chris there?  Yeah, is anyone trying to bang Lady Di?  Huh?  Is anyone trying to bang her? 
[01:59:00]  Not me.  Did you guys go to bed yet?  I'm still up.  They're sleeping.  They're sleeping together?  No.  Chris is on the couch.  And I'm up.  Dude, be honest with us.  Be honest with us.  How much did Lady Di have to drink last night?  A lot.  Yep.  You know she has a drinking problem, right?  So do I.  All right.  Are we on the air or not? 
[01:59:30]  Hell yeah, we're on the air.  Oh, cool.  This is what we do every day.  We just screw off.  Oh, good for you guys.  All right.  I'm screwing off today.  So what?  Did you guys meet in the local gin mill or something?  No, not really.  Where'd you meet?  My friend Chris met Lady Di.  Uh-huh.  And then now I'm here.  And you guys just crashed there?  Yeah.  I'm crashing for a couple days.  It's a flop pad.  I have nowhere to go, so I'm hanging for a while. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, what a mess.  Is it a nice place?  Oh, yeah.  Very nice here.  Yeah.  Are you homeless usually?  Me?  Yeah.  Where do you usually live?  I live in Garwood.  Jersey.  Oh, Jersey.  Okay.  It's here at Cranford and Westfield.  All right.  This is Westfield here.  All right.  Let's go to the next town over.  All right.  Let's get Lady Di back on the phone.  All right.  All right.  I'll wake her up again.  All right.  Wake her up again.  All right, brother.  Here's a-  Be cool, man.  You guys are awesome.  All right.  Lady Di needs a job and she's-  A job?  Yeah. 
[02:00:30]  We all need jobs.  Jesus.  What a mess.  All right.  Here she is.  All right.  All right, brother.  All right.  Be cool.  We're being cool, yes.  Hey.  Lady Di.  Yeah.  You know you need a job, right?  Yeah.  And Stalker Patty's trying to find you a job.  Okay.  Did you get your resume together?  No, I had my resume.  What are you going to send it to her?  You're supposed to give it to Patty so she can maybe get you a job.  Okay. 
[02:01:00]  But you'd rather spend Tuesday after a Monday night of heavy drinking, right?  Wait.  Hold on one second.  Hold on one second.  All right.  Uh-huh.  All right.  So, do you want me to read my resume over to Patty?  Could you read it over the air?  How are you going to read it over to Patty?  Read it over to Patty.  You drunken mess.  Hold on one second.  She's still all effed up from the night before.  You can just hear that drunken seven-eighths in the bed. 
[02:01:30]  I just woke up.  All right.  Hold on.  We got Stalker Patty on the line and Lady Di.  Stalker Patty.  Here's Lady Di.  Yeah.  All right.  Lady Di.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Tell one of your drunk friends to turn down the Beatles for a minute.  Jesus.  It's like the Beatles said.  You did enough.  All right.  So, what do you want me to do?  All right.  We got Stalker Patty on the line.  Stalker Patty, go ahead.  Talk to your friend, Lady Di. 
[02:02:00]  Okay.  Go ahead, Patty.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  So, when are you going to send me your copy of your resume or experience that you've had?  All you have to do is just write it on a piece of paper and just mail it to me.  I gave you my address.  Well, I have it right here.  Do you want me to type it out for you?  You don't have to type it.  I'll do that for you.  Just write it down.  I just want to know what you've done in your life.  Wow.  Lady Di, why don't you read off your resume for everybody? 
[02:02:30]  All right.  All right.  Summary.  Production Specialist with 17 years of experience, of diverse experience, and Food Production Factory.  Food Consumption?  Food Production.  Oh, Food Production.  So, you were a cafeteria lady for a while.  No.  Shut up, Anthony.  All right.  Did you wait on customers?  All right.  Lady Di, Di.  Demonstrated ability to operate and run packers, uncasers, labelers, and fillers. 
[02:03:00]  What does all that entail?  Fudge Packers.  He's throwing in some lines.  Fudge Packers.  God, what a mess.  Okay.  You know, put it in a nutshell.  Did you wait on customers?  Did you prepare food?  Did you do paperwork?  Did you do happy lifting?  This was my job for 17 years.  And you don't know what it entailed? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, you got to be a little bit more specific, you know?  She was good with a ladle.  What a mess.  There's certain ability to operate and run packers, uncasers, machinery.  The guy's still going to talk about that.  He's throwing the same line in.  I can't talk over here.  Why?  No, because my friend is eating something right now, and he's laughing at me.  What's he eating?  You're a twat? 
[02:04:00]  Chinese food.  Chinese food.  Okay.  In the morning.  Chinese food.  Cold Chinese food in her place.  All drunk.  All right.  Demonstrated ability to operate and run packers, uncasers, labelers, fillers, and other type  of state-of-the-art food production, robotic machinery.  Look at that fat broad running me.  Warning, warning.  She's going to explode, Will Robinson. 
[02:04:30]  Why don't you tell me in layman's terms what all that jargon is?  Get your fat paws off me, you pig.  I will run myself.  I do not need a bloated drunk to operate my machinery.  1985 to 2002, working over it, bud.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Lady Di, what else is on this resume of yours?  All right.  Rand Barry's... 
[02:05:00]  Well, there's a couple of other things.  All right.  If you let me finish.  Oh, go ahead.  All right.  Rand Barry's production lines, including packers, machinery.  Yeah.  She's reading that four times now so far, the packers.  I know.  What's a packer, by the way?  Judging from her body, she played for the packers.  And what do you pack besides your fat body into size 52 pants? 
[02:05:30]  We'll see you November 13th, Mr. Norton.  All right.  So what else?  All right.  So 1984 to 1985 salesperson, Daffy Dan's.  Clothing store.  Daffy Dan.  Did you wait on customers?  Did you work the register?  Yes, I did.  Okay.  Yep.  All right.  So that's the experience I can write down that you've done.  Now, when you make your work experience record out, 
[02:06:00]  you've got to tell me specifically, year, date, who was the company,  who could they contact?  Include all blackout periods you've had.  1985 to 1988, no recollection whatsoever.  And you have to fill in the gap.  You can't drink it like that.  She's been trying to fill in that gap for years.  No one will take it.  All right.  And, you know, a good resume has to be like one page long,  or they're going to just throw it in the trash. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  Lady Di?  Yes.  You've got some work ahead of you here.  We're trying to get you back on your feet.  You're a mess.  I am not a mess.  You're a mess.  You haven't slept yet.  It was a Monday night.  You need a job.  Your buddy told us you were drinking all Monday night.  You know, you should have been going to bed early the night before to be up at six  to get a head start on things and start hitting all the businesses and places. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, listen to Mary Tyler Moore.  She knows how to be a career woman.  Hey, Patty?  Yeah?  Has Di been good with getting up and going and looking for jobs?  Has she been very a go-getter?  No, not at all.  By the way, Craig is reminding us that Lady Di forgot to add Laurel Stunt Double to her resume.  Thank you, Craig.  It's actually Oliver Hardy.  Yeah, I know.  And she forgot to add her hair as Stunt Double for Crypt Keepers. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, no.  Get out of here, my hair.  I love when Lady Di has no idea what we're saying to her and just goes, oh, stop, Jimmy.  All right.  Thank you, Starker Patty.  Okay.  She's not a go-getter.  She's a go-eater.  Henri.  Hello.  Henri.  Make this fast, Henri.  I don't believe this.  Are you the new Frenchie or what?  What?  Is he the new Frenchie?  Yeah, he's the new Frenchie. 
[02:08:00]  Of course he's the new Frenchie.  Talk to her, Henri.  Hello, drunk.  Hello, retard.  How are you guys today?  We're doing well, Henri.  No, no, no.  I said drunk and retard.  He's not even talking to us.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, I'm not.  That was the old Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  I'm smarter and Anthony doesn't drink as much.  What are you doing, Ray?  I heard that they said shut up, shut up, drunk.  I heard the drunk got fired for drinking too much.  Is this true?  We don't know the story, but she's definitely out of work and she's running a flop house at this  point with guys that like to drink a lot. 
[02:08:30]  Budweiser decided to get a new set of Clydesdales and they had to let her go.  I just don't understand how we have money.  Oh, that's not true.  Shut your mouth.  Oh, boy.  How do we have one fucking retard giving another retard job advice?  I don't know.  It just makes for good radio, though.  That's not true.  Shut up, pig.  Listen, I just want to check in with you guys, say that, and vote Gary.  Bye.  All right.  There he goes.  All right, Lady Di.  Yes.  You got to get your act together.  When are you going to bed today?  I just woke up.  What time do you go to bed? 
[02:09:00]  What time do you go to bed?  We'll get her to move around.  Three o'clock in the morning, I guess.  Di, I want you to move around.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  Are you hoofing it?  I'm in my bed right now.  I don't know what to tell you.  All right, Lady Di, we're going to let you be, okay?  We're going to check in with you in a little while here.  The poor thing.  The bed, I mean.  Get your resume to Stalker Patty.  Okay, listen, you can call me back? 
[02:09:30]  Maybe.  We'll see.  You didn't call me, Tony.  Tony, you didn't call me.  Go jump off the Verrazano.  All right, thank you, Lady Di.  See, she's a mess.  Oh, she really is a slovenly fatso.  Hey, who's up?  Dude, it's Tuesday.  She was partying and drinking with two guys over her house on a Monday night.  Yeah, she's going to do well.  Good job.  Hello.  Hello.  Who's this?  Nathaniel.  Oh, what's up, buddy?  What do you got? 
[02:10:00]  I got Debra in the Tony Danza line.  Oh, is she a big Tony Danza fan?  Huge fan.  All right.  Is she a fatty?  I'm sorry?  Is she a fatty?  Not really.  Okay.  All right.  We'll talk to her.  All right.  Here you go.  Hello?  Hello, Debra.  Hi.  Hi, it's Tony Danza, Debra.  Hi, how are you, Tony?  Real good.  I hear you waiting to get in on my show.  I can't wait.  You can't wait, huh? 
[02:10:30]  Hey.  My little friend, Leslie, and it's her birthday today.  Leslie, how old is she today?  Oh, I don't think she wants me to tell you that.  Oh, come on.  How old are you today, Leslie?  She said 39.  39.  You need to be the judge.  Hey, happy birthday, huh?  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Hey, my thoughts and prayers are with her on this fine birthday for her.  Tony, you know who I thought you should have been for Halloween?  Who?  I thought you should have been Sammy Davis because I watched the tape when you did the tribute  to Sammy Davis. 
[02:11:00]  Remember your tap dance?  Oh, of course.  I love hoofing like Sammy.  I know, but I thought you should have been him for Halloween.  Well, I actually, I went with the Spider-Man.  Did you see?  I didn't like that.  I didn't like it either.  I needed an apron to cover that up.  You know what I'm talking about, huh?  I know what you're talking about.  Hey, Tony Danza junk hanging out all over the place.  No, that was not for anybody to see.  No, not for public consumption, huh?  No, I don't like those outfits.  Needed a dressing room just for my car.  I didn't hear you.  A bus just went by.  Yeah, the bus went by. 
[02:11:30]  Good thing, huh?  Perfect timing.  Thank God.  So what do you like about my show?  I think you're very real.  I think you're very fresh.  I think you're just...  Wait till you see how fresh I can be.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I think you're just, you're very wonderful.  You're gracious to your guests.  You're gracious to us that are watching you at home.  Hey, thank you so much.  I want to tell you something, Debra.  We are gonna...  Do you know where you're sitting for the audience?  No, I don't.  But we have VIP tickets. 
[02:12:00]  I don't know what that means.  My husband's friend got them for us.  Well, let me tell you what that means.  You are gonna be in the front row, and I'm gonna come over during the show and talk to you.  Okay.  You're gonna be on...  You're gonna be on television, and I'm gonna, you know, talk a little bit about the news,  maybe the election.  Who'd you vote for?  I didn't vote yet.  I'm voting after I leave you.  And who are you gonna vote for?  I'm not quite sure.  How about vote for Tony?  You know?  All right.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  Okay.  Would I be able to get a picture with you?  Oh, absolutely.  Okay.  I actually wanna...  You pull my mule out, put it on your shoulder, and take a picture like that.  Pull your what out?  My mule.  A mule?  A mule.  You know how I ride up on different things every time?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm gonna have a mule.  You know what I'd rather you do?  A big mule right in your face.  My mule.  You know what I would rather you do when you open the show?  I'd rather you open it up with a song.  Oh, you like when I sing?  I do. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, I think you should do what you do best.  And what's that?  I have no clue.  I have...  When we were at Regis, I bought my CV in, and you said being I was the only person that  had your CV in the audience, you came over and you signed it.  And I think that's how you should open the show, rather than do the silly stuff.  Oh, you don't like the silly stuff?  No, I like that you honored your father when you came in on the garbage truck.  Hey, well, thoughts and prayers, you know?  Right.  I like everything that's, like, sentimental and everything. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, sentimental.  Like my mule.  Like the stilts?  You made me very nervous.  Oh, you didn't like the stilts?  It was kind of dangerous, wasn't it?  No, because...  Danger is my middle name.  Well, you have to be careful.  Hello?  Hey, I'm so happy that you're coming on the show.  I am, too.  Could you describe yourself so I know what you look like when I walk up to you?  Okay, I have blonde hair, brown eyes.  I have on an argyle sweater, black, with different colors in it. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  And I have my friend Leslie with me, and she has short blonde hair.  How many?  Well, what do you look like as far as your body-wise, so I could distinguish you from other blondes?  Oh, I'm pretty good.  Oh, you're hot, huh?  Yeah, I'm pretty good.  Yeah?  Hey, you know...  I have to hang up.  How would you like to go out with me tonight?  I would love to.  You want to go out with Tony?  I would love to.  Tony and my mule. 
[02:14:30]  Okay.  Yeah?  Hey, do you take it up the ass?  Goodbye.  Hey, Debra.  Debra.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Enjoy the show.  Hello?  Well...  Nathaniel.  Yes, I am walking away fast.  What happened?  What happened at the end there?  She goes...  She looks at me and goes, he was nasty at the end.  She still thinks it was Tony? 
[02:15:00]  I think so.  Oh, God.  That was awful.  Yeah.  I'm so uncomfortable.  How is she going to look at him now in that show?  All of a sudden, he just gets up and belts him in the face.  For no reason.  All right.  Great job, buddy.  Thanks.  Try to find one more person that wants to talk to Tony Danza, okay?  They're going in right now.  Oh, really?  That might be it for today.  All right.  Thank you.  You guys did a great job out there.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Oh, yes.  You got it. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  Oh, my God.  Take it off the end.  Poor woman.  Just trust her image of the man she loves.  There you have it.  Okay.  More Brokaw audio on the way.  Also, the chick flick thing and more of your phone calls.  We're all in the same boat, fellas, but our shenanigans are cheeky and fun.  Yeah.  I mean, shenanigans are cruel and tragic, which makes them not shenanigans at all, really.  Do you even shenanigans?  I swear to God, I'll pistol whip the next guy that says shenanigans. 
[02:16:00]  Hey, Farber, what's the name of that restaurant you like with all the goofy s*** on the walls and the mozzarella sticks?  You mean shenanigans?  No.  Not judging.  Shenanigans.  Shenanigans.  What are you doing?  I'm declaring shenanigans on you.  Shenanigans?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Say hello.  Yes.  Stand call, please.  This is Mike Matthews.  This is a collection.  Mm-hmm.  I'm calling in regards to your delinquent account with Dr. Tomah. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  It has been turned into our collection agency for an amount of $43.  You've got to be kidding me.  No, sir, I'm not.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Let me tell you something.  That doctor had me come in about six months ago for a full physical.  Put me there in his little examination room.  Told me to get naked.  I'm sitting there by that naked for about 20 minutes.  Finally, he comes in and says, put this gown on.  I'll tell you, the gown had lace on it.  And he told me, finally, he said, well, check my prostate out.  I told me to bend over.  So, you know, I'm thinking, hey, he's a doctor. 
[02:17:00]  He's going there.  I'm bending over.  I checked my prostate.  Turn around.  The guy had both hands on my shoulders.  I don't think it's damn bit funny right now.  He's in there laughing at my experience I got through.  Sir?  Yeah?  Your medical history is irrelevant, sir.  I'm telling you, he's not getting no money from me.  I went there to get a physical.  Told me to put a 90 on it.  I put the thing on it.  He took my prostate out.  Had both hands on my shoulders and everything.  I can't even look at my wife the same way.  Come out, Bob's cutting the grass next door. 
[02:17:30]  And I get kind of sexually aroused.  And I don't even know which way I'm coming or going.  Do you understand?  Have you talked to them over there?  Have you talked to them?  Yes, I have, sir.  I've talked to their...  Did he ask about me?  No, the doctor's not even involved.  I'm talking to their accounting department.  I mean, he's still jogging and working out the weights and everything.  I have no idea, sir.  He's getting kind of buffed there for a while.  I think he's got up a little bit like Brad Pitt.  Sir, is your good credit history worth $43? 
[02:18:00]  And a lot of virginity for $43?  Don't worry about that damn $43.  Or maybe I'll call him up.  If he didn't hear you were calling me right now, he'd probably be pissed.  Because he don't know that you're...  I'm sure the hell he don't know what this is all about.  Sir, your account is going to turn over to Ed.  It leaves our hands and goes into the lawyer's hands.  That's about to...  Boy, I'll tell you what, you're about as much pain in the ass that he was.  I'm going to go.  Screw you, buddy.  We'll be right back. 
[02:18:30]  Starbucks.  XM Radio.  Time is not a clock.  It is music. 
[02:19:00]  XM takes you on a journey from the beginning of great pop music through every decade to the millennium.  It is the most complete replay of musical history ever.  And only XM can bring it to you.  Now playing on 70s on 7.  Channel 7.  It's the O&A virus.  XM 202.  XM news, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything. 
[02:19:30]  All the time.  On the O.P. and Anthony Show, we're going to make fun of people with Down Syndrome.  I just didn't want to be in the middle of the flight and have him yank that handle hoping candy comes out and blow the door off the plate.  We all get sucked out except for him because his head gets stuck.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Give me fuel.  Give me fire.  Give me double time.  It's all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America. 
[02:20:00]  If you're enjoying what you're hearing, please tell a friend.  We could use the support.  It's election day.  Yes, we know that.  Yep.  We've already declared George W. Bush as the winner.  No one else has the courage, O.P., or the insight, actually, in the election to declare a winner this early in the game.  But we have.  Lots of things coming in.  A message from the Beastie Boys.  Please get out there and vote.  All three of us are voting for Kerry, and we hope you will, too.  This election is the most critical we've seen in our lifetime.  Please vote and help to make a change. 
[02:20:30]  Shouldn't it be the Beastie Men already?  I mean, jeez.  Well, the Beastie Boys works for them still.  They're not quite the boys anymore in Brooklyn.  And then we got John Kerry talking about Eminem.  The question.  I like that they melt in your mouth and not in your hands.  Oh, not that?  Not Eminem?  He has no idea, obviously.  MTV asked Kerry, have you heard the new Eminem song?  That's been out.  And Kerry says, you know, I heard Eminem on Saturday Night Live last night. 
[02:21:00]  I heard the song that he did.  I don't know if that's part of his new album or not.  I liked it.  But that's the only thing that I've heard in the last weeks.  I'm on trial.  I'm on trial.  I'm on the trail.  I'm campaigning every day.  He didn't see Eminem on Saturday Night Live.  Who is he kidding?  A little controversy about the Eminem on Saturday Night Live, Opie.  He had a backing track.  More lip syncing.  The thing is, you know how Eminem sounds on his albums?  His vocals are doubled.  You can't do that live.  So they play a backing track, and he sings over it, which I think is harder to do, especially 
[02:21:30]  with the type of music he does, that quick-paced talking.  It's kind of hard to keep up with the rap track that's under you.  But it's not lip syncing.  It's not that he's lip syncing.  He's just doubling the vocal.  Eminem.  I like him, too.  I never wanted to like Eminem, but he's too good.  We said the latest Eminem song, Sex Bagel.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  That's not the latest one.  Now everyone report to the dance floor. 
[02:22:00]  All right, stop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no.  Yeah.  He said it best.  Stop it.  That one's good.  All right, let's say hi to Taylor Law.  You want to set this up?  Oh, my goodness.  Taylor Law was lesbian for a day on Friday with her friend Mia.  She did a great job for us.  A lot of people saying Friday Show is the best show we've done so far on XM Satellite Radio.  Had a lot of fun, Anthony.  Yeah.  She took the wiffle ball bat like a champ.  She did about six and three-quarter inches, I do believe.  And, man, everyone feeling really good about the show and ourselves. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  And then Raquel called us yesterday and sent email to people and members of the show.  And she was a real buzzkill, the donkey sausage chick from Radio Shack.  And she trashed Taylor and Mia, saying they were like fake lesbians and they weren't that hot.  And she was insulted that she couldn't get in there.  Yeah.  You know, she was just, I don't know, she was just being a baby, basically.  And she trashed Taylor pretty good.  So we want to say hi to Taylor.  Taylor.  Hi.  Hi, Taylor.  It's Tony Dance. 
[02:23:00]  What's going on?  Nothing much.  I heard she was seriously talking some shit yesterday about us.  Yes, using things like calling you two fake lesbians, fake porn star.  Not that hot.  Not hot.  She actually...  Bad implants.  I think she was blind because she actually said you were ugly.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, you know, I was going to try to take the high road and just say that I prefer only  working with blondes or girls that I know.  But you know what?  I prefer working with girls that don't have tires for stomachs. 
[02:23:30]  Her ass.  Like, even if I went to go to lick her pussy, I don't even think I'd be able to find it.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, didn't like her ass at all, huh?  Yeah, Raquel had the nice face working, but it got worse and worse as you moved your eyes  downward, I do believe.  Yes.  Yes.  Saggy tits and the stomach was just atrocious.  And I just don't understand how she could say that was fake.  Did she not see my tongue in me as pussy?  Yeah, I know.  It wasn't fake.  It was happening right there in front of everybody. 
[02:24:00]  I saw everyone's thighs shaking like jello.  Yeah.  It was the real deal.  And as far as saggy tits and an atrocious stomach, I want to know, what do I have to  do with this?  You hushed, you.  You're a cutie.  Oh.  Oh.  A little love connection?  Yeah.  Look at you.  All right.  Wow.  So you're saying the reason you just weren't attracted to her at all.  Yeah, you weren't attracted to her.  You pretty much told people behind the scenes, I will do nothing with her.  Yeah, that's pretty much it. 
[02:24:30]  I mean, I was told as long as she's hot, then fine.  And I didn't have a problem with that.  When I walked in, me and I both took a look at her, and we were like, there's no ain't  how we're touching this chick.  So.  There you have it.  All right.  Wow.  Well, there you go.  Brutally honest.  I'm kind of stalling because I'm hoping that Raquel would call in the show and we could  have a fine cat fight, Anthony.  She's probably selling some of that fine equipment at Radio Shands.  We're going to put you on hold for a second just in case we could get her on the line.  Maybe Ben could find Raquel real fast. 
[02:25:00]  I mean, we have to just put an end to this finally.  Nathaniel.  Yes, sir.  What's going on?  Not much.  I have Doreen waiting in the Tony Dan line.  Oh, my God.  Are we going to go to the well twice?  Yes.  Why not?  We always have the first one to remember.  Let's see if we can get her to do that.  All right.  Let's talk to her.  All right.  Just a sec.  What's her name?  Doreen.  Doreen.  Doreen.  Am I soft?  Yeah.  What's that?  Go ahead.  Okay.  Hello?  Hey, Doreen.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  Hey, guess who this is?  I don't know.  Not Howard Stern, I hope.  I don't know.  Yeah, it's Howard Stern.  How are you doing, honey?  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.  Hey, you are waiting on the Tony Danza line?  Yes.  Yeah.  What are you going to do there?  We're going to watch Tony Danza film the show.  Why didn't you come down to my studio, honey?  Where's your studio?  Yeah.  I'll strip your ass and throw bologna at you. 
[02:26:00]  Are you going to have an X-rated radio show?  Yeah.  I don't listen to X-rated TV radio shows.  I don't know.  She wasn't buying it.  Doreen, thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, thank you.  All right.  See, we went to the well.  No, no, no.  Here's the problem.  She wasn't going to buy it.  He's got to say it's Tony.  Yeah, he's got to say who it is.  Put it back on.  Yeah.  And Nathaniel.  Yeah.  You're ruining the bit. 
[02:26:30]  You got to tell people that we got Tony Danza on the phone and that you're like working  for the show.  The only problem is there's a bunch of people with clipboards and headsets, which are ruining  the illusion for me.  They're like right next to me.  I have to talk to these people.  So.  What?  People from the show?  Yeah.  They might call my bluff pretty easily.  So whisper it to the person.  Tell them it's a contest and whisper it.  All right.  You want to give it another try?  Um.  Put me on hold.  All right. 
[02:27:00]  We'll put him on hold.  See if he's got anything.  Okay.  See if we can get that going.  Because I would love to have somebody run out onto the stage.  I know.  We got an idea.  That's why we went back to the well.  We probably shouldn't have.  But we have an idea that.  Yeah.  It's just.  Could be really funny.  If it worked, it would be the funniest thing that's ever happened.  Ever, ever, ever.  Ever, ever, ever, ever.  All right.  The morning we go back to the Tom Brokaw audio.  We're just about done with this here.  Brokaw had an exclusive interview with President Bush.  Here's another clip here.  The other issue that has developed quite dramatically in the last week or so is the disappearance 
[02:27:30]  of hundreds of tons of explosives from an ammunition depot in Iraq.  Rudy Giuliani, who's been one of your strongest advocates, said on the Today Show the other  day, it was not your fault.  It was the fault of the troops who failed to secure that site.  Is that fair to those troops?  Well, first of all, there's a lot of.  Is that fair to those troops?  Is that fair to those troops?  There are tons of missing explosives. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, President Bush, you want to take a picture of me and my mule with you?  Big fan.  Did you see me in my Spider-Man costume for Halloween?  Halloween.  All Hallows Eve.  You know, most of our listeners don't watch the Tony Danza show.  We should tell them for Halloween, Tony Danza came out in a Spider-Man outfit with no underwear  on it.  His freaking mule was on display.  And the cameraman, every time the shot of Tony hit the screen where you could see his crotch, 
[02:28:30]  the cameraman was slowly moving the shot upwards.  Slowly, like, zoomed in on Tony so that his crotch would be out of the picture.  But it was done so slowly as to not make you think, oh my God, even the camera has to,  you know, make these moves to keep us from seeing Tony's mule.  And they couldn't disguise it.  They had a full shot of him when he came out in his Halloween costume.  Look, I'm Spider-Man.  And it was just this huge Tony Danza Italian pecker right through his Spider-Man costume. 
[02:29:00]  Hanging to the left.  Hanging there.  And he even talked about it.  He goes, oh, I sure could use an apron.  And then wasn't he using the mask or something to try to cover up his crotch?  Yeah, then he took the Spider-Man mask off his head.  And surprise, it's Tony.  You know, and then he's holding the mask over his crotch.  So you don't see just this huge Tony Danza mule.  It didn't work, though.  His cock got so much camera time, they gave it a SAG card.  That big, delicious lump. 
[02:29:30]  My Italian sausage.  All right.  I think we want to play one more clip of Brokaw because this one, let me see.  Yeah, Bush attacks Brokaw in this clip.  Mr. President, in the opening of his debate, Dick Cheney, your vice president, said,  if I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of  action for Iraq.  Even if you knew that there was no storage of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, even  if you knew that the Republican Guard could fade into the North and the West with their 
[02:30:00]  weapons and mount a very effective insurgency against us, even if you knew that we didn't  have enough troops to secure all the sites in Iraq necessary to be secured at the time,  you would recommend exactly the same course of action.  Well, Tom, the bigger question is, should we have removed Saddam Hussein in the first place?  Oh, Jesus.  But that's what happens afterwards as well.  But that's easy to second guess.  I mean, I've never known you to be a Monday morning quarterback like this. 
[02:30:30]  I mean, oh, hey, go fuck yourself, President Bush.  Did you realize that the weapons would go to the insurgency?  Insurgency.  Man, he had a tough time with that.  Yeah, he shouldn't talk for more than 20 seconds at a time.  Bush is probably just fixated on his mouth, just looking at it, not even understanding  the question.  Yeah, I got to back up a little bit here.  How do you, he can't speak. 
[02:31:00]  Monday morning quarterback like this, I mean, of course, we can look back and history will  judge whether we could have done something differently.  But you've asked me the question in the context of, really, should we have removed Saddam Hussein  in the first place?  No.  And the answer is, yes, sir.  We should have.  He didn't ask that.  A leader must be steadfast and strong.  A leader must make decisions on principle.  You know, tactics change, strategies change, but principles should never change.  And I think the American people are going to decide which person, which human being, has 
[02:31:30]  got the capability of leading this nation forward into what I believe is going to be a hopeful  21st century.  He didn't answer the question.  That was a shit look.  Broke on to me is an ass, but he asked a legitimate question.  He asked the question.  And stupid, you know, hey, look, if you knew all this, would you do it different?  And Bush is like, hey, nitpicky, nitpicky.  Hey, the actual question here is, should we have done it in the first place?  No, the question was, did you take into consideration all of the things, you know, having taken that  into consideration, all the things that happened, would you do it again? 
[02:32:00]  Oh, brother.  What a tool.  Like, if you knew that most of those weapons would be found hidden in the front of Tony  Danza's Spider-Man suit, would you take the same action?  Mr. President, considering the fact that Tony Danza's crotch is a storage crown for weapons  of mass destruction, weapons of mass destruction, weapons of mass destruction, weapons of mass destruction, whip!  That guy, yeah, anything over 20 seconds, and he just loses it.  Okay.  Running out of oxygen. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, we got Raquel?  Oh.  We got Raquel?  All right.  Let's go back to this little...  Yeah, let's finally end this.  Raquel?  Yes.  Have you been listening to the show today?  Obviously.  Not really.  All right.  Well, I got Taylor on the phone.  We really got to put an end to this.  Taylor?  Yeah?  Okay, Raquel is on the line.  She hasn't been listening to the show today, so could you repeat what you told us?  Sure.  All right, go ahead.  Raquel, when I walked in, I was told that you were going to be hot. 
[02:33:00]  So when we walked in, me and I looked at each other...  Well, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry that I'm not blonde, blue eyes, and, you know...  Well, I'm sorry, too.  It doesn't happen that way all the time.  Listen, plain and simple, plain and simple.  I wasn't attracted to you.  I wasn't attracted to your friend.  I really don't care.  It's done and over with.  I'm a husband.  You're a husband.  I don't care.  I'm done.  All right?  Thanks for everything.  The guys were great.  Everything was fun. 
[02:33:30]  Blah, blah, blah.  Goodbye.  Wow, that wasn't much of a fight.  Oh, yeah, of course you did.  She's a psycho broad.  Is that it?  We should have had her say, your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  If she...  Why did she start all this shit then?  If she was done and she wasn't attracted to me or me...  We gave that some serious thought and we came to the conclusion she's a lunatic.  And she wants to be part of the Opie and Anthony program.  And we don't hire women.  We just don't.  They ruin everything. 
[02:34:00]  No, they don't.  We want our women to live in our fantasy world.  And Raquel thinks she could bring some intelligence to this program and we're just not interested.  Well, she can bring fat to the program.  That's for sure.  All right.  Love it.  Thank you, Taylor.  You want to plug anything?  Just my Erotic Film Girls DVD and the TaylorLaw.net. 
[02:34:30]  TaylorLaw.net.  L-A-W-E, right?  T-E-N-T-A-L-A-W-E.net.  All right.  Thank you, Taylor.  Thank you, guys.  Bye.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  She's calling back.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Raquel.  What's up?  We don't want you going away, man.  Just go away.  Yeah, why do you keep hanging up?  I mean, no one's trashy.  Listen, you know what?  You're not a bad-looking girl, so why are you taking this from Taylor? 
[02:35:00]  Taylor.  I read on air there.  Taylor.  TaylorLaw.  It's contagious.  All right, Raquel.  You want me to see your mom's box?  No, just calm down.  Taylor thinks you're a little chubby around the midsection.  Hey.  And she thinks your boobs...  I used to feel a lot chubbier, so...  You know, I didn't want to say this, but she also said that your boobs were a little saggy.  Said your ass was a little wide, too.  I don't have a...  And she said something about it looks like you sat down in a gravel driveway. 
[02:35:30]  What?  I said I don't have a size triple D fucking fake breasts, so my...  I do believe they were double D's.  Oh, okay.  So, I remember saying, I think Taylor has double D's, and in between the licking, Taylor  gave me a thumbs up like, you got it.  She also said your ass looked like you sat on a bunch of pop rocks and then brushed it  off.  That's great.  That's great.  All right, so Taylor basically didn't think you were attractive, and that's why she didn't  invite you to participate. 
[02:36:00]  That's all.  That's fine.  So, what's wrong with her face?  What do you mean?  Well, she's not that attractive either.  Huh?  She's not that attractive either.  She's what they call a porn attractive, okay?  A what attractive?  Porn attractive.  You'd fuck her into porn, but you wouldn't make her your girlfriend.  Oh, really?  All right.  Okay.  Really.  Let's get good.  I'm going to just sit back.  Taylor?  Um...  Taylor, it's your turn for rebuttal.  The only thing I can say is I got thousands of emails after the show on Friday saying 
[02:36:30]  how hot I sounded, and then everybody went to the website, and from seeing the website,  they had now confirmed what you guys were all saying about how hot I was.  Yeah, you're porn attractive.  There's no doubt about that, but how many of these guys that actually take you home should  meet their mother?  Probably every one of them.  For a threesome.  Mom, this girl was sucking on five men's cock. 
[02:37:00]  And...  Your point is...  You would take that home to your mother?  Yeah, my father, actually.  Okay, well, Raquel, how can you take pictures of me and I for your boyfriend because we were  so hot?  Did you really...  You took pictures, Raquel, with the lesbians?  Yeah, I did, yeah.  Absolutely.  Answer the question.  Because my boyfriend's addicted to porn, that's why.  All right, we're not getting anywhere with this.  No.  No, we're not.  We're going to agree to disagree. 
[02:37:30]  That's right.  Oh, boy.  We've had the debates, now it's your turn to decide...  We're not...  Who's the bigger hose bag?  ...presidential election here, so...  No, no.  All right, Raquel.  The point is...  Yeah?  The point is I'm done.  All right, you are done.  Say your mom's box.  Your mom's box, please.  Your mom's box.  All right, and there she goes.  All right.  Famous last words of everybody on the program.  Thank you, Taylor.  Bye, Taylor.  All right, there she goes.  I like how Raquel did the dramatic hang-up and then has to call back. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, all right.  I'll see you.  Okay, she spoke her piece, and then I've had it.  Goodbye.  Click.  Redial.  Daniel.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, you got a homeless guy waiting?  All right, we're going to take a break.  We got to figure out...  We got to get this radio show back on track.  So, why don't we take a break?  We'll step aside.  We got to do the chick flick thing.  We got a bet going.  Oh, yeah.  We'll talk about this next, okay?  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony.  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children. 
[02:38:30]  So, turn them off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice.  My midget buddy wants to be a weatherman.  But they'll never be a midget weatherman.  No one would believe them.  A flood is coming.  Yeah, to you.  What, did someone leave a faucet on or some shit?  We call my midget buddy baby shoes.  Because he's got tiny little feet. 
[02:39:00]  And he calls me horse cock Johnson.  Because four inches is pretty big to a midget.  Ah, me and baby shoes.  We do everything together except seesaw.  Because that really wouldn't be fair to him.  The other day, me and baby shoes, my midget buddy,  we're hanging around my house.  Thinking of ways of turning my garage into a crystal meth lab.  You know, guy shit. 
[02:39:30]  All of a sudden, he gets up off my bed,  repels down the phone cord to the floor,  and goes,  Hey, man, I gotta get going.  I'm late.  Then he starts running, and running.  Have you ever seen a midget in a hurry?  Well, you'd know if you had.  Because they don't slowly get smaller like you and me.  They just disappear right away.  And then there's a beautiful rainbow.  He was late for work.  For work.  If I was a midget man, I'd be constantly late.  I'd come in hours late. 
[02:40:00]  My boss would be all pissed off.  Where were you?  Why were you late?  I'm trying to run a chocolate factory around here.  What's going on?  Hotel.  I'd be like,  Why was I late?  Look at these little legs.  There was a puddle.  I had to swim it, fucker.  Oh, my God. 
[02:40:30]  I'm sorry.  I thought I had a parrot on my shoulder.  You ever get that?  Nothing.  Nothing.  I wish I had a parrot.  I really do.  And I wouldn't teach them dirty words or songs.  No.  I would teach them phone numbers and addresses and recipes.  I'd use them more like a Palm Pilot, you know?  Or I'd teach them things that might save my life.  You know, like information.  Like,  In case of an earthquake, get in the doorway.  Baaah! 
[02:41:00]  No one has freckles on their ass.  Use a condom.  Baaah!  Thank you, parrot.  Here's a grape.  Here's a grape.  We played street football right there on the street.  And this is where we had the greatest quarterback in the world.  Our quarterback, he had to control 23 men on the side. 
[02:41:30]  And he was really great at it.  You women don't know anything about it.  You played with dolls and stuff like that.  But here's a guy with an ingenious mind.  He'd call a football play like this.  He'd always get down on one knee and draw things.  You know, he'd take a Coke bottle top.  Uh, now, uh, Shorty, this is you.  This is a Coke bottle.  I don't want to be the Coke bottle top.  Okay, uh, what do you want to be?  I want to be the piece of glass.  Okay.  Now, listen to this now.  Uh,  Arnie,  go down, uh,  ten steps  and cut left 
[02:42:00]  behind the black Chevy.  Okay.  Philbert,  you run down to my house  and wait in the living room.  Cosby,  you go down to 3rd Street,  catch the J-Bus,  have him open the doors at 19th Street.  I'll fake it to you.  George, I have one fat kid,  he never thought of this.  What about me? 
[02:42:30]  You go long.  Get a lot of good plays  going like that,  you know.  I'll throw it over the water tower  and you'll catch it  as it bounces off.  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony,  Jim Norton sings.  Forget me not,  you sightless taut,  you dog just shit on my rug.  Thought that was pretty  fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony show.  You don't do sketches, stupid.  Everything you say to me  Ah, you're still funny on tape today. 
[02:43:00]  You ought to put out an album.  I love that one.  Forget me not.  Alright, really fast.  Mia wants in  and then we really gotta move on.  Mia was the other girl  in the,  well, she was the actual  lesbian for her day  on Friday.  Taylor did a fine job on Mia  and Raquel was on the sidelines  feeling quite left out,  I guess, right?  Dejected and rejected.  Mia, real fast  because we gotta move on  to other things.  Okay, I just can't believe 
[02:43:30]  she's like mad at us or something.  She was really nice,  I mean, trying to be nice.  She came in dressed like a pigeon  and took her clothes off  and it just got worse after that.  A pigeon!  She was supposed to be  a black angel.  Like an angel.  She looked like a pigeon  and once the clothes came off  it just got worse.  What was so bad  when she took her clothes off?  What was good?  I couldn't find anything.  I like this Mia girl.  I didn't think you had the chops  but you're good. 
[02:44:00]  I'm a very nice person  but when you get caddy  I have to get caddy back,  I guess.  Well, Taylor noticed  that she had something going on  with her midsection.  There was a lot going on there.  That's the problem.  And you guys didn't want  anything to do with her, huh?  No, I really don't think we did.  I guess she was pretty mad about that.  She still asked for our picture  after the show  but when you work at Radio Shack,  I don't know.  All right.  I'm heading off  to a photo shoot, guys  and she's heading off  to sell batteries. 
[02:44:30]  I had a podcast on you show.  You guys were awesome.  I had so much fun  and I'm really glad  that she wasn't a part of that.  You know what?  I think we should hire Mia  for the radio show.  That's pretty funny.  That would really piss off Raquel.  Anytime.  You guys got to get  a couch in there, though.  I know.  Yeah, we will.  Well, the lady  that was supposed  to bring the couch in,  she overslept.  Was it Lady Di?  She was hungover or something  and couldn't get down here  from Rhode Island.  I was hungover.  I made it.  Right on. 
[02:45:00]  Thank you, Mia.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Bye, Mia.  Bye.  Funny as that.  I wasn't going to go  to that phone call  but it was good.  She was very good.  I'm off to a photo shoot.  She's off to sell batteries.  And batteries  are such a good word  for that line.  Of course.  We have to interrupt  this program  for the ozone  midget sighting.  Yes, we've renamed this.  The ozone midget sighting.  An old friend of ours  used to do this bit.  We realized.  See, we give credit  where credit is due.  And our listeners  reminded us  that ozone  used to do this bit.  Oh, okay. 
[02:45:30]  Get back, get back.  Julie.  Yes.  What's going on?  I was in PECCO  the other day  with my three-year-old  and they were having  a competition  for all the animals.  And a midget  brought in his midget horse  dressed up as a clown  with his hair dyed  and everything.  And I tried to explain  to my three-year-old  who was asking the questions,  Mommy, why am I taller  than that man  and that horse?  Because he's a freak  of nature, son.  That should be shunned.  Can you say  genetic disaster?  How can you compete  against that  if you're in a competition? 
[02:46:00]  Let me tell you.  A little fella  dresses up  and brings in  his midget horse.  What do you got  that competes with that?  Not a midget  on a midget horse.  Nothing.  What trumps  a midget on a midget horse  in a competition  like that?  A Dachshund one.  It was disgusting.  It was disgusting  listening to this man  talk about his midget horse.  Well, I've had him  for quite a few years now  and I love dressing up  like a clown  and riding my midget horse.  And I love when people 
[02:46:30]  look at me  and make that fearful face  and run away.  And the poor horse,  you know,  it was just born that way  but this friggin' midget  has to sit there  and put hair dye  in rainbow colors  in this horse  and this horse  is just, you know,  chewing its hay  like,  you gotta be  freakin' kidding me  because the Great Danes  that were there  were bigger than everybody  and I mean,  the midget was looking up  at this Great Dan  going,  damn,  that's a really big  freakin' dog.  Hey,  was that his whole gag?  Whoa,  look at the size  of this horse. 
[02:47:00]  Oh,  it's a dog.  Oh,  ha ha.  My little pony,  my little pony.  I just figured  I'd give you a call.  It was quite a call.  All right.  It's a good midget sighting.  Yeah,  that's today's  Ozone midget sighting.  Well,  yeah.  There you go.  All right,  thank you.  No problem.  It's a great show,  guys.  Wait,  wait,  wait,  wait,  wait.  Yeah.  Oh,  that's painful.  Jeff from Connecticut.  Click.  Hey,  guys,  how you doing?  Long time,  listener.  Glad to have you back.  Jeff,  welcome to the program. 
[02:47:30]  Hey,  gotta tell you,  you gotta get rid of Norton.  Dump this guy  because he sucks.  What?  Every time he opens his mouth,  he drains the funny  from the room.  Whoa,  easy there,  Jeff.  I gotta tell you,  hey,  Norton,  Bob Kelly was on the other day.  I couldn't tell the difference  between him and you.  Get a new stick,  buddy.  You stole it from him.  You're a one-trick pony.  Yeah,  your mother's a one-trick pony,  too.  When I give her money,  she sucks my dick  and eats my ass.  You fucking fan  with an opinion. 
[02:48:00]  Your mother's a trick-turning pony.  She sucks horse cock  while bad 70s music plays.  You're an unfunny little troll.  You're an unfunny little troll, buddy.  That's the best you have?  Unfunny little troll?  I say your mother sucks pony dick on film  and you call me a troll?  Do I trip-trap under a bridge?  Drop dead, motherfucker.  I'm not a professional.  You're a professional.  You're not a professional.  You're a fucking nobody.  You're an anonymous zero.  You suck.  I may suck,  but your mother swallows 
[02:48:30]  and takes it on the face.  Hey,  my mother may take it on the face,  but at least she's funnier  than you, motherfucker.  She's not funnier than me.  The only thing funnier about her  is she's a woman with a cock.  That's what's funny  about your mother.  And she dangles it  over your father's face  like a Roman war helmet.  You're the worst.  You're the worst, man.  I may be the worst,  but I'm well-paid  and you're a listener,  so sit there, boy,  and listen.  Put on your headphones  and listen, little fella.  I drain the funny out of a room  the way your mother  drains semen out of black cocks. 
[02:49:00]  Where'd he go?  I don't think he could take it.  Holy Jesus.  First of all,  how does he come out  against the beloved,  the beloved Jimmy Norton  on this program?  It has to happen sometimes.  I have to apologize.  I knew Norton was having  a bad day.  And he's been sitting there  during commercials going,  I have nothing today.  He's just not.  He's talking about how he took,  what, Tylenol PM or something?  Oh, I took it last night 
[02:49:30]  about midnight.  I'm just wiped.  It's like opium.  I can tell Norton is just like  kind of not happening today.  He's a little miserable.  And I knew that guy  wanted to go after you.  I set you up so fast.  Oh, he could call everyone good.  I could have helped you out  like an old pal.  No, you tell them.  Oh, let him throw every time.  Let him throw every time.  That was really good.  Instead, I'm like,  I know this is going to get him  going, man.  Rob from Melville,  Norton rocks,  that caller blows.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, okay. 
[02:50:00]  John from Iowa wants to try  the trucker rhyme.  Oh, the trucker rhyme.  This show just stinks.  This show just stinks.  We really are a bunch of  this show.  Hillbillies stinks.  This sucks.  All right.  Go ahead, John.  Come on.  This is not going to suck.  I promise.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  Chicago's a fucking shithole.  Here's the why and how.  Traffic's fucked up.  The people suck.  There's also that piece of shit,  no talent, man cow.  I hope and pray with all my power. 
[02:50:30]  The next suicide plane  hits the Sears Tower.  Die, motherfuckers.  Die.  Wow.  Thank you, John.  Very dramatic.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow.  This sucks.  This sucks.  This sucks.  This sucks.  I know it sucks.  Relax, dude.  This sucks.  We're trying to get some funny  back into the program.  We should get rid of that guy.  He drains the funny  every time he calls.  Oh, I hope that caller  dies in a fiery wreck. 
[02:51:00]  Fucking hope your leg  is severed in a drunk  driving accident, shitbag.  I think he got to you, though.  No, he annoyed me.  He got to you a little bit.  Bring stupid, fat Bob Kelly's  name into it.  Drag my awful neighbors  into this.  Well, Bob Kelly's a  brilliant comic.  Yeah, Bob's a good comic.  I love Bob.  Mormon from D.C.  Roman war helmet reference.  Always funny.  Always funny.  Okay.  Wow.  Where do you go after that?  His mom taking the black cock, 
[02:51:30]  as Jimmy said.  Wow.  You had to go there.  I didn't like his fucking  call up with phony bile,  horse shit.  Call up like he's angst-filled.  Fuck you.  Booshbag.  All right.  Let's go to Daniel.  Daniel.  Hey, what's up, dudes?  We sent our interns  out on the street today.  This is another thing  that just has gone  horribly wrong.  Where are you now, Danny,  if I may?  Yeah.  I'm down in Central Park,  Southside. 
[02:52:00]  Southside, Central Park.  Yeah.  All right.  Hanging out with Jesse,  the homeless guitar player.  Oh, right on.  Okay.  Oh, one with an act.  Should we talk to him?  Why don't we talk?  Well, you don't want to  hand over your phone, huh?  Well, I would.  I just need some.  I get antiseptic  when I get back.  Oh, really?  Probably.  Okay.  Well, ask him  who he's voting for.  So, Jesse,  who are you going to vote  for today at the election?  Well, first of all,  I'm Jesse Soap Gelbar  from the band  Really Red Ruins. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  So you're going to vote  for me?  I'd like to vote for  Bush.  He says he's voting  for Bush.  Are you registered  around here?  Yeah.  You are.  The homeless love Bush.  Yeah.  You would think  the homeless would hate Bush.  I know.  Why is he going to vote  for Bush?  So, Jesse,  why are you going to vote  for Bush today?  I think he deserves  a chance to redeem himself.  For a chance  to redeem himself. 
[02:53:00]  That's kind of  the homeless attitude.  They're looking for  a chance at redemption  and they want that  in their candidate.  The last four years  sucked, but we want  to give him another  chance to redeem him  a shot.  We'll give him another  four years and see  what happens.  Four years, he could  turn it all around.  We're going to turn  this thing around.  Keep your chin up.  We're going to turn  this thing around.  I think that's all  we're going to get  out of Jesse, huh?  Yeah.  Well, he's playing  his guitar for you.  I don't know if you  want to hear any of that.  He's got his little  Yeah, ask him if he  could play a song  that we could recognize. 
[02:53:30]  All right.  They want to know  if you could play a song  that we might be able  to recognize.  Maybe a cover tune.  Here's a tune by  Here's a tune by  The Really Red Ruined.  Playing an original  opie.  I know.  The name of this song  is I Have a Hard Liver  and I Smell Like Shit.  Is he playing or  beating a jogger 
[02:54:00]  over the head  with his guitar?  Not only homeless  but talentless as well.  Do you guys like that?  No, not at all.  Give him a dollar  to stop.  He stinks.  That was horrible.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  You got it, man.  All right.  We're going to do  the chick flick thing next.  Shut your mouth.  I said shut your fucking mouth.  I masturbated so hard 
[02:54:30]  I almost broke my vagina.  I saw this wino.  He was eating grapes.  He's like,  Dude, you have to wait.  I like to drink red wine.  This girl says,  Doesn't red wine  give you a headache?  Yeah, eventually.  But the first  and the middle part  are amazing.  I'm not going to  stop doing something  because of what happens 
[02:55:00]  at the end.  Mitch, do you want an apple?  No, eventually  it'll be a car.  I went to the store  and bought eight apples.  The clerk said,  Do you want me to put them  in a bag?  I said,  Oh, no, man.  I juggle.  But I can only juggle eight.  If I'm ever here  buying nine apples,  fucking bag them up.  I saw a guy  juggling chainsaws.  It was cool,  but unless something  needed to be sawed down,  then it's just annoying.  It's like,  Come on, Rick.  Can we use one? 
[02:55:30]  Track number five  will not be  Chainsaw Juggling.  It will be this one.  I was going to have my teeth  whitened,  but then I said,  Fuck that.  I'll just get a tan instead.  I got some tartar-controlled toothpaste.  I still got tartar,  but that shit's under control. 
[02:56:00]  If the tartar gets out of line,  I'm like,  Come on, man.  You know the deal.  Fall in.  You crazy-ass tartar.  I got so much tartar,  I don't have to dip  my fish sticks in shit.  That's actually  kind of gross.  After that joke,  I always clarify  that I'm just joking. 
[02:56:30]  I don't know  how much tartar  I actually have.  I believe it's  the average amount.  If we all did  a tartar test right now,  my name would be  right in the fucking middle.  I would like to go fishing  and catch a fish stick.  That would be convenient.  I could easily get a job  with Mrs. Paul's.  They'd just put me in a boat  with some empty boxes.  And I would return them 
[02:57:00]  to the freezer section  of your neighborhood  grocery store.  You know there's  a fishing show on TV.  They catch the fish,  but they let it go.  They don't want to eat the fish,  but they do want to  make it late for something.  Where were you?  I got caught.  Bullshit.  Let me see the inside  of your lip.  Fish are always  eating other fish.  If fish could scream,  the ocean would be  loud as shit.  You would not want  to submerge your head.  Nothing but fish going, 
[02:57:30]  ah, fuck.  I thought I looked  like that rock.  100 channels  of crystal clear  digital audio.  XM satellite radio.  Radio to the power of X.  Oh, it's so cute.  Whoopsie-daisy.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Asses like 10-year-old boys.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  The 50 greatest chick flicks  of all time.  You're checking out  the O&A Show.  Thank you.  Greatest.  Thank you.  Yeah, according to  Oprah Magazine,  we have a list of the  50 greatest chick flicks  of all time.  Don't worry.  This is going to be  painless.  Really?  Well, we were looking at it.  Because I read a couple  of the synopsis.  Synopses.  We got that as well, right?  And it was the most 
[02:58:30]  boring thing ever.  Well, here's what  we're going to do.  You know, we weren't  even going to do this.  You know, we're like,  ah, whatever.  It's a bit that  probably won't work.  But then we're all  looking at the list  and we're noticing  that there's films  on here we've all seen.  So then we decide  to have a little  competition to see  who is the person  that has watched  the most of these  chick flicks.  Yep.  And I'm saying  that Steve C is  going to win.  Yeah.  And then I got a  side bet with Anthony.  I think Anthony  has seen more  of these movies  than I.  And I know  there's going to be  controversy because 
[02:59:00]  I don't agree  with one of these  movies.  Well, we'll work it out.  We'll work it out.  Yeah, I hope so.  Hey, guys, is Ben  in on this list?  We've got to get  Steve in here.  We told him to come  on in for this, right?  Are they awake yet?  They're coming in.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  All right.  Yeah, I don't agree  with one of the selections.  I don't agree that it  was at all a chick flick.  Well, we'll discuss.  And I just happen  to see it.  So, you know,  it's adding one  to my number,  which I don't think  should be there  because I don't think 
[02:59:30]  it's a chick flick.  Also, there's another  one that we got  to get a criteria  for if you actually  watched it or not.  Is it watching  a chick flick  if it's on  in the same room,  you were in the room  for the duration  of the movie,  but you were doing  something else?  You've got to be honest.  I mean, if you're  taking peeks,  like you might have  a slight interest,  then you've got  to count that film.  So it's pretty much  if you know...  But if it's in the background  and you're like,  oh, she's watching whatever  and I'm playing Halo  or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Because that's kind  of the situation  with one of these. 
[03:00:00]  You've just got to be honest.  I mean, if you've seen  enough of the movie,  you've got to count it.  Okay, I'll be honest  in that I have no clue  what this movie's about.  So it was on  the whole time  I was in the living room,  but I was playing Doom.  Okay.  Did you tally up  how many of these  movies you've seen?  Yeah, I could take  one off though now.  Why?  Because we just got  the criteria.  Well, no.  I wasn't watching it.  Hold on.  We'll talk about it  when we get to it.  Son of a bitch.  Now he's going to  try to take it back.  That's right.  We just made the rule  and I just made the rule  and by the rules  that we just made.  I don't want to be  considered more faggy  than you. 
[03:00:30]  This one.  Too late.  I'm going to fight  like a mother effer here.  I don't want the title  of the person  that saw the most  chick flicks here  according to Oprah Magazine.  I remember you talking  when you go with your girlfriend.  Here's the deal  because people like  to be in suspense.  Yeah.  Let's not do the top ten.  All right.  Let's keep the top ten  out of it.  Top ten out of it.  For now.  Okay.  So we'll start  with some of these movies.  All right.  Okay.  Steve, you're in here.  Ben. 
[03:01:00]  Let me just see  the front page.  Did you highlight?  X-TOP.  I think Steve  has this one in the bag.  Where's the second sheet?  Right there.  All right.  Let me see.  Well, the question was.  Get on the mic.  Oh, my God.  You are.  You got problems.  Robin Pyle,  get on that microphone.  The question I brought up  with Anthony earlier was,  if you saw a partial film,  does it count as?  You just,  you got to be honest.  If you were watching it 
[03:01:30]  and you were slightly interested  and you got kind of,  you know,  pulled in a little bit,  well, what's the time frame?  Do you know what the movie's about?  Do you know the characters?  Do you really know the plot?  Okay, yeah.  Based on what you watch,  not reading about it.  Based on the five minutes  you see on HBO  while you're, you know.  No, five minutes  is you're passing through the room.  Oh, my God.  Okay, five minutes  doesn't count.  If you're sitting for five minutes,  that means you've taken an interest  in the flick.  Five minutes ain't nothing.  I'm talking if you're in the same room  for five minutes.  That's nothing.  Five minutes is going to swing mine 
[03:02:00]  another 11, you know.  He's got a lot of question marks  on his list.  If that movie was on  and you're in the room  and you know what's happening  during the course of that movie,  you watch the movie.  So how was Bend It Like Beckman,  you faggot?  If I see,  I know Keira Knightley  was in the movie.  I know it's about soccer.  So if I see five minutes of it,  I know what movie I'm watching.  I'm not really sure  what it's about, though.  What's the plot of that movie?  Couldn't tell you.  Come on, don't be shy.  I really don't know.  I don't know.  Then he didn't watch it. 
[03:02:30]  You gotta be,  these have to be movies  you watched.  Be honest.  All right.  They're movies that you watched.  Okay.  If your chick has it on  in the same room  and you're doing battle  playing Counter-Strike,  you know,  I'm not gonna say  I watched the movie.  I'm crossing one off my list.  Which one are you crossing  off your list?  The Virgin Suicides.  You saw The Virgin Suicides?  No, that's just it.  My girlfriend was watching. 
[03:03:00]  Explain this.  Shut up.  The Virgin.  Look, Norton's just looking  at me disgusted.  Your girlfriend was  watching something  and what were you watching?  The belly button of a man  as your head went  back and forth?  Look, it was on.  It was on.  All right.  The movie's on.  I was playing Counter-Strike.  Okay.  The computer's in the living room.  That makes it so much cooler.  It was.  I was kicking ass,  taking names.  I have no clue  what the movie's about.  All right.  I wasn't watching it.  All right.  So I'm crossing it off the list 
[03:03:30]  and changing my total.  What's the movie about?  What's the movie about?  I don't know.  And you know something?  I would be honest with you.  I would tell you.  I believe it's about suicide.  I don't know.  Okay.  Maybe it's a figurative title.  All right.  How are we going to do this?  We've got to go through  some of the ones.  There it is.  Now that's my new total  that I'm not telling anybody yet.  All right.  Why don't we start with you, Anthony?  Start with me.  You want a total?  Do we want to do totals right away?  Oh, my God.  You better have more pink 
[03:04:00]  on the second sheet  or I'm in trouble.  I got a lot on the first sheet  and I have a problem  with one of the movies also  that I don't believe.  All right.  Let's go to the second sheet.  What movies did you see  on the second sheet?  There's only a few listed here.  I have none on the second sheet  because I crossed out  Virgin Suicides.  I have none.  I did not see  Bend It Like Beckham.  Steve.  A little cute Indian soccer movie.  Is that what it was?  Opie, did you see number 43?  Little Women?  No, I did not see Little Women.  You didn't see Little Women? 
[03:04:30]  I couldn't even tell you  what that was about.  It's about Little Women.  I didn't see Little Women.  It's like a kiddie porn film.  Did you cross any off  on the back sheet?  No.  You have none on the...  I certainly don't.  I got one on the back sheet.  You have one on the back sheet.  Yeah.  Let me see if I can guess which one.  All right.  Was it Laurel Canyon?  Yeah.  You saw Laurel Canyon?  Yeah, she was really hot  in that movie.  Yeah, yeah.  Try to make it something cool  and man.  The brunette in Laurel Canyon  was really hot.  I have no idea  who you're talking about.  She has a lesbian experience  with that chick from Fargo. 
[03:05:00]  You might be off the hook here.  Why?  I think you might be talking  about a different movie.  Oh, really?  Let me check.  Let me go to...  Oh, Frances McDormand?  Yeah, what movie was that?  Fargo.  I'm saying that's her name.  No, no, I know,  but she was in Laurel Canyon, right?  I don't know.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me check really quick.  And look how hot this chick is.  You can abuse me  if this is the one.  Okay.  Let's see.  You got it?  Laurel. 
[03:05:30]  All right, hurry up.  Her name is Kate Beckinsale.  Yeah, she's beautiful.  And she gets banged  by pretty much  everyone in the movie.  Yeah, man.  That was a cool movie.  Oh, that one, Christian Bale?  Christian Bale, wasn't that?  Kate Beckinsale?  Yeah.  Frances McDormand?  Yeah, I saw that.  Okay, then you saw that one.  I have no problem  saying I saw that.  Get a picture of Kate.  Look how hot she is.  All right.  It doesn't matter.  And she's like...  She's kind of hot. 
[03:06:00]  I'll give it to you.  All right.  Wow.  Okay.  Hey, that ain't bad at all.  All right.  Well, okay, look.  Look, don't be silly.  There are plenty of hot chicks  that are in really bad movies.  I don't know what the...  Just because she's hot  doesn't make it  that you were quite the man  watching this piece of crap.  Frances was the mother  and her son was going out  with that piece of ass, Kate.  And they moved in with the mom  who was banging  the lead singer of a band  she was producing.  And then Kate is all, like, bored. 
[03:06:30]  Top it.  And the other guy's trying to...  Her boyfriend's trying  to be a doctor  and doesn't have enough time for her.  So then Kate starts hanging out  in the recording studio  and in the pool  and there's threesomes going on  and she's banging everybody.  There you go.  Wow.  Thank you.  That sounds great.  Yes, I am gay.  Doesn't matter, dude.  It's still a chick.  Anyone else have any  on the back page  they want to admit?  No?  No, no one else.  You're the only back page guy. 
[03:07:00]  You take it on the back page.  All right.  Why don't we go from  30 down to 42.  30 down to 42.  Okay.  Let me mark that off.  Don't give your tolls yet.  No, no.  These are the 50 greatest  chick flicks of all time.  I have one movie  that lies between 30 and 42  on the list.  All right.  Which movie would that be, Anthony?  Probably one of the worst movies  I've ever seen.  A bore fest.  This actor, 
[03:07:30]  always in movies  that just  incredibly dull  and boring.  Okay?  Except for that one movie  he did about getting a blowjob  from that black chick  while he was cheating  on his hot girlfriend.  No, that was real life.  It's got to be Hugh Grant.  Oh, that was his real life?  Yeah.  I thought it was a movie  because it was so out of character  for him.  Hugh Grant in a lot of chick flicks.  Four Weddings and a Funeral.  I saw that piece of crap.  Awful movie.  I saw it.  I saw it.  Did you see it, Jim?  I certainly didn't.  I love how nasty he gets. 
[03:08:00]  No!  There were three films  in that race.  Oh, three for you?  Yeah, three for you.  All right.  Well, I saw Four Weddings  and a Funeral  and that's the only one  in that area.  Awful, horrible chick flick.  I'm totally guilty.  I sat down.  I watched the thing  and by the end  I was wondering  why the hell  I was watching it.  But then you put in  so much time.  You're committed.  You know, it's like  betting a lot in a pot.  You know your hand  might not be the winning hand.  Someone bets at the end  the last bet  after all the cards  are out there  and instead of folding  you call  and you know 
[03:08:30]  you're going to lose.  That's kind of what it's like.  I don't really remember  what that movie was about.  I don't either.  Incredibly dull.  I saw the whole thing.  Mike from Bridgeport  wants in really fast.  Mike, go ahead.  Yo, you're talking about  the movie with that  Natasha chick, right?  Was Natasha in that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Natasha who?  I don't know the last name.  It's like Natasha  blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, Natasha  McKellen.  Oh, was she?  Yeah, she's the one  that was in that  Solaris movie  with George Clooney. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, yeah, okay.  I got a picture of her  right here, Opie.  She was in that movie?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was in  Laurel Canyon.  That movie's totally  not a chick flick.  Not at all, man.  There were some hot scenes, right?  I don't know why  they call some of these  movies chick flicks.  Because that Kate character,  she was all innocent and stuff  and then she, you know...  Oh, she got a banging  from the lead singer  and her boyfriend's mom  got involved.  It was pretty hot.  Dude, if you don't think  that's a chick flick,  there's one on this list  that is so far removed  from a chick flick  that I would defy anyone  to even guess what it is 
[03:09:30]  because it's impossible.  You would not put this  in a chick flick category.  It's one of my favorite  movies of all time.  Oh, I got it.  What?  The Color Purple.  Shut up.  I saw that.  Great film.  You saw that?  Great film, yeah.  Okay, it's a chick flick.  I don't know  if that was though, man.  This is according  to Oprah Magazine.  Well, she was in  The Color Purple.  I know.  Fat ex-slave,  she looks like.  All right, so you saw  The Color Purple.  Yeah, it was great.  What else is on your list  in that section?  Terms of Endearment?  Oh, God!  I'll take that to...  Yes, stop it. 
[03:10:00]  That is the most sappy...  He says that with confidence.  Did you have a box  for Kleenex?  I might have cried a little,  yes, so what?  I mean, it was Debra Winger,  obviously Nicholson won  the Oscar for it,  one of his three  as a supporting role,  and Shirley MacLaine.  What was the movie  about there, Jimmy?  Debra Winger.  Oh, I think Nicholson  was an ex-astronaut  and a drunk,  and he was hooking up  with Shirley MacLaine,  and Debra Winger  was dying of cancer.  Yeah.  It was sad.  The daughter dying  of cancer gag.  Yeah.  Oh, what a great movie  that is.  What an upper.  What a movie  I just want to tune in 
[03:10:30]  and watch.  Why do people watch those?  I like a good sad film sometimes.  Oh, stop it.  Your life is a sad film.  It really is.  Why would you want  to watch that?  But you enjoyed  Terms of Endurance.  I did enjoy it very much.  What else is on your list?  Great film,  She's Gotta Have It,  with Spike Lee's first flick,  which is not really  a chick film.  What is She's Gotta Have It about?  It's about this chick,  Nola Darling.  It's filmed in black and white,  and there's three different guys  who she's trying to pick between,  and one of them is Spike,  who's like this little homeboy.  It was Mars Blackman, actually,  which was the character 
[03:11:00]  that did the Michael Jordan commercial.  Three simple words.  I am gay.  That's not a gay film.  That's a chick flick.  That's a chance to choose  between the three guys.  One guy is like real slick,  and I forget what the other guy was.  It's been a long time.  Well, they're calling it a chick flick.  And why was that a good film?  Spike Lee's hilarious in it.  He's a brilliant director.  I loved it.  All right.  They're calling it a chick flick.  No, it's not.  Is there a third?  Yeah, I gave it to you.  Color Purple,  Oh, you weren't joking about Color Purple.  No.  Okay.  Oscar winner.  Steve or Ben? 
[03:11:30]  Ben?  Between 30 and 42?  Just four weddings and a funeral.  Oh, he's not.  I didn't really think that was that bad,  if I remember correctly.  I don't even remember what it was about.  It was a snooze fest.  I couldn't even stay awake.  It was awful.  All right.  That's the only one I saw.  And Steve?  A lot of segments,  but not whole movies now.  All right.  What segments did you see?  What segments?  Yeah.  Smooth Talk,  She's Gotta Have It,  Four Weddings and a Funeral,  and The Color Purple.  You do understand that if you lick the helmet and the balls,  it's still technically to suck the dick?  Well, that's why I was at it. 
[03:12:00]  I only licked two sections of it.  I didn't actually pop the whole thing into my mouth.  What is Smooth Talk about?  I think it's a Dolly Parton.  She's a talk show host.  But that's about all I know about it.  Oh, God.  You're awful.  Oh, wait.  I never saw it.  I think that's about all I know about it.  No, that's not it?  Was James Wood in that?  I don't know.  Who's James Wood?  What movie are you talking?  Smooth Talk?  I mean, what?  Wait, I think Christopher Reeve was in it, actually.  No.  What did he play?  A tree stump?  What's Smooth?  She was like a talk show host?  No, wait.  No, that's Straight Talk.  That's Straight Talk. 
[03:12:30]  I'm wrong.  I'm wrong.  Treat Williams and Laura Dern.  I'm wrong.  Okay.  I crossed that one.  And Mary Kay Place from 1985.  All right.  I dodged that bullet, man.  Nope.  Didn't get that one.  You didn't see that one, then?  No.  Smooth Talk?  Nope.  Nope.  Okay.  Treat Williams and Laura Dern.  All right.  From 20 to 30.  Oh, oh.  Let's look now.  We'll start with Anthony.  How many of those movies have you seen?  I have seen one movie in this category.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to get killed in this category.  Well, don't worry.  I step it up real hard and heavy on the upper part of this list. 
[03:13:00]  All right.  Which are the number one, you know, the big ones.  The big ones.  I saw.  This is a biggie.  You know what happened?  And I'll tell you why I saw this.  I saw this movie recently.  Very recently.  And it came out a while ago.  I don't even know what year it was, but it's a few years old.  I saw it thinking it was another movie.  I confused the name of this Bull Durham with the movie, if you remember, Major League. 
[03:13:30]  Remember the comedy Major League?  Uh-huh.  I turned on Bull Durham thinking it was Major League.  And I'm watching.  And then I realized it's not funny.  And it's a chick flick.  So I accidentally saw Bull Durham.  I love Major League.  It's funny.  What tipped you off?  An hour into it, you didn't see Bob Euchre?  Yeah.  I was waiting for the uke.  And it never came about.  And then my penis shriveled up to nothing.  And I realized I was watching a chick flick.  That was the only one in that section, huh? 
[03:14:00]  Only one.  Oh, boy.  All right.  It's to me.  I hope he's got a few.  Let me pick them for you.  I did see Bull Durham.  I know you saw Bull Durham.  I think a lot of guys have seen Bull Durham.  Here's one I am so proud I never saw because I know everyone saw it.  Pretty Woman.  Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ben.  Steve.  Jimmy.  I have not seen Pretty Woman.  And I'm damn proud of it.  Never saw it.  I don't feel ashamed of that.  For me, it was more research.  Stop it.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:14:30]  Sure.  It was so accurate.  Yeah.  Well, I saw Pretty Woman.  You saw Pretty Woman?  Yeah.  Let me think.  What else?  How many did you have in this category?  Three.  Three.  Bull Durham.  Pretty Woman.  Let me think.  Opie, did you see Pat and Mike?  No, I didn't see Pat and Mike.  Okay.  What the hell is Pat and Mike about?  I don't know.  Sounds like a real chick flick, though.  How about The Lady Eve?  Did you see that one?  The Lady Eve.  No.  No?  No.  No.  No. 
[03:15:00]  Which one was it?  It wasn't Breakfast at Tiffany's.  No.  Oh, Breakfast at Tiffany's.  No?  It wasn't Something's Gotta Give.  What did you see?  I want to hear you say it.  Bridget Jones.  What?  What?  Bridget Jones.  Come on.  What?  What?  Bridget Jones' Diary.  Oh, come on.  But she's hot.  Even when she's a little chubby.  Stop with the hot.  I don't care if the chicks in the movie are hot.  You know she gains weight for those movies.  Who cares? 
[03:15:30]  You couldn't be a bigger faggot if you saw Robert Reed's Diary.  And you were an entry in it.  Bridget Jones' Diary.  What was it about, Opie?  Give me the synopsis.  Come on.  I think she's...  I think.  Look, I'm not sure, but you know what it's about, faggot.  She writes for a newspaper or something, right?  Yeah.  I don't know.  And gives advice.  New to me.  And then she's going to choose between two guys, I think.  Who does she choose, Opie? 
[03:16:00]  There's Hugh Grant.  Oh, Hugh Grant's in that one, too?  And then some other dude.  Colin Firth.  And what?  Colin Firth is in that one.  And Hugh Grant is just a mess of a fella.  And I think she chooses Hugh at the end of the film.  Oh, God.  I'm the only one.  No, I saw it.  Yeah.  I saw it.  Oh, well.  Steve's on.  You know what?  As bad as this is for me, I guarantee you're going to win this thing.  There it is.  I don't think so.  A British woman is determined to improve herself while she looks for love in a year in which 
[03:16:30]  she keeps a personal diary.  Blah!  Oh, why did you see that?  You two couldn't be bigger homos if you got into the covers and watched First Wives Club,  you fucking pansies.  Why did you see that?  It was the thing to do at the time.  Were you alone watching it?  No, no, no, no.  Oh, okay.  You're with a girl.  Yeah, of course.  All right.  There are times you watch movies together.  Personal diary. 
[03:17:00]  As a New Year's resolution, Bridget decides to take control of her life, starting by keeping  a diary in which she always tells the complete truth.  The fireworks begin when her charming, though disreputable boss, Hugh Grant, takes an interest  in the quirky Miss Jones, and the ups and downs of their ill-fated relationship, prove hilarious  and touching at once.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Someone's got info on Smooth Talk. 
[03:17:30]  Dude, that is the worst movie I've ever read about.  They're making a new one.  It's going to become an out soon, I believe.  Bridget Jones Diary 2?  I think so, yeah.  Well, it's not 2.  What is it called, Steve?  Oh, yes.  The, oh, I think it's called Bridget Jones Diary.  Leave your balls at the door.  I think it's called the Edge of Reason or something like that.  Can you get advance tickets at the Gay Men's Health Prices Center?  Will in South Carolina.  What's up, Will?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just want to call and commend you on your show. 
[03:18:00]  I've been here since day one, and that's definitely gaining some momentum.  Norton, you don't need to give that bozo any time of day, man.  You're awesome, brother.  Thank you, but we have to let those calls through, sir.  It's only fair.  All right.  All right.  So, you have info on Smooth Talk?  Yeah, Smooth Talk.  Lord Dirt is pretty cool, guys.  It's actually a guy flick.  If they show Lord actually getting banged at the end, Lord, it'd be right up your alley, dude.  She's a teenage girl, apparently, for the day. 
[03:18:30]  Some slick guy stumbles upon her at her house.  They're hanging out all day, and it's basically about him talking her out of her panties.  And at the end, she gets fucked at the end, and her parents come home, and there's a little drop of semen at the corner of her mouth, so you have to look closely for that.  Come on.  And this is a chick flick?  Do what?  It could be a chick flick.  Don't let sex scenes, even some action, don't let it sway you, because a chick flick, you know when you're watching a chick flick. 
[03:19:00]  So, in this section, Anthony saw a bull dorm.  I saw a bull dorm, Pretty Woman, and Bridget Jones' Diary.  Bridget Jones' Diary.  18 T-cells and under.  Get in for free.  Oh, that's funny.  If you're over 17, you have to be accompanied by an out homosexual.  For me, I saw a bull dorm in Pretty Woman.  All right.  And I liked Pretty Woman.  Ben?  Same as Jim.  Same?  Okay.  And Steve?  To you?  Jesus.  Which eight did you see?  I saw four.  Eight out of the ten.  Four.  I saw a bull dorm, Pretty Woman, Bridget Jones' Diary, and Something's Gotta Give. 
[03:19:30]  Something's Gotta Give.  And what gave?  Your desire for vagina?  What is Something's Gotta Give about?  That was Nicholson.  Nicholson's last movie, the one with Diane Keaton.  Oh, crap.  Oh, God.  Is that the one where they look at each other naked?  Oh, wait a minute.  That's exactly which one that is.  Opie's raising his hand.  Add another one to the list, my friend.  I didn't know that was the name of that movie.  Take out your pink highlighter and highlight it.  I took my niece in Florida, though. 
[03:20:00]  I don't care.  You saw the movie?  We had a movie that she could, you know.  You want to talk about circumstances?  I could be down to two.  I forgot about that.  Keanu Reeves.  Yep.  Frances Borman.  Oh, boy.  You better look that list over, Pally.  I'm in trouble now.  Oh, wait.  I got to fix my total.  Oh, no.  Yep.  I got four in that category.  That movie.  Jack was kind of funny in that movie.  I personally like that movie.  Oh, it looked awful.  You know.  I love Jack.  Yeah, I was going to say.  It's so believable, though, that Jack would, you know, blow off, you know, the hot piece 
[03:20:30]  of young ass for the old head.  Exactly.  Of course.  That's, you know, give the wrong message to the women out there.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, brother.  I have four in that section.  You're beautiful.  Even when you're a certain age, you're still attractive.  You're not, you fucking meatbags.  Are we taking 11 through 19 now?  Yeah, let's go 11 through 19.  All right.  And then we'll finally get to the top 10 of this exciting bit.  This segment, I have a big problem with one of the movies that I've seen.  I would, I have, I have three, three in here that I've seen. 
[03:21:00]  Okay.  In 11 through 19.  One of which I am totally disputing.  It is not a chick flick.  It isn't.  It's one of my favorite movies.  And I don't care if it's a woman empowered movie because that's why they're giving it  the chick flick label.  You don't even have to sell this.  I'm with you.  And I think everyone in the room.  We've all seen it.  We've all seen it.  So it's going to be one for all of us.  It doesn't matter.  Right.  Okay.  It's Aliens.  Aliens.  Aliens has made the 50 greatest chick flicks of all time. 
[03:21:30]  Chick flick?  Yeah.  We're doomed, man.  How about we do this section a little bit?  Why don't you put her in charge?  How about we do this section a little differently?  You raise your hand if you've seen the movie.  I'll read them off.  Okay.  In 11th place.  No, we'll go 19th place.  Okay.  How about a here or an I?  No, just raise your hand.  How about a, it's got to be audible.  It's got to be audible.  All right.  19th place, The Shop Around the Corner.  All right.  No?  18, The Black Narcissus. 
[03:22:00]  All right.  17.  This sounds like it could be a cool movie.  Maybe we should look this one up.  What?  Girl Fight.  No one saw Girl Fight?  Okay.  16.  Oh, I think we're going to see some hands here.  What's Love Got to Do With It?  Of course.  Yeah.  It's a great flick.  Not a chick flick.  Stop it.  It is a chick flick.  Ike Turner beats her and rapes her on console.  That's a chick flick I can get into.  That's half the plot of every Lifetime movie.  That was a great flick.  And then the woman gets empowered.  Now he beats her with a boot in the back of a limo.  Oh, he's great. 
[03:22:30]  Wait, what's...  Ike Turner.  Yeah.  Ike and Tina Turner.  Ike and Tina Turner.  Raise your hand, Opie.  No, I didn't see that.  I didn't see it either.  I did not see that.  Did he win the Oscar for that?  He didn't.  Fishburne.  Yeah, he did.  No, Fishburne didn't win.  I thought he should have, right?  No.  All right.  Yeah, interesting.  Let's move on.  15th place.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Let's go to 13th place.  It's not 15th, Opie.  Come on.  Thelma and Louise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw that one.  Ben?  Yes.  I saw it.  I didn't see Alien move.  How about his abs, everyone? 
[03:23:00]  He looked good in the cowboy hat.  Wow.  Total chick flick.  All right.  I don't care.  And there's a lot of action, a lot of gunfire, a lot of killing in that one, right?  Yep.  Stop it.  Right off the cliff at the end.  There was a lot of gunfire, right?  And explosions.  Sure, sure.  Cars going over the cliff.  We'd love to see Susan Sarandon doing real life.  That's a cool movie, right, guys?  Right?  Yeah, sure.  14th place is Aliens.  We've all seen that.  Except for Ben.  Yeah, I never saw it.  You never saw the second one?  No, I never saw it.  It's a good one.  All right. 
[03:23:30]  13th place.  50 greatest chick flicks of all time.  I saw it.  I'd see that.  Alice doesn't live here anymore.  You saw Alice doesn't live here anymore?  Now, I'll tell you why.  Scorsese, I would see that.  That movie came out many, many years ago.  And I'll tell you, it was probably a time where...  It's a Marty movie, though.  Marty.  Yeah.  What?  Marty Scorsese.  Oh, Marty Scorsese.  Yeah.  It came out many years ago, like when movies were on regular television. 
[03:24:00]  And that's when I saw it.  When I was a kid.  There's nothing else to watch.  But it's on the list.  What is it about, though?  I have no clue.  I couldn't even tell you what it's about.  But I know I saw it many, many, many years ago.  Anyone else?  I never saw it.  Oh, my God.  Steve, you had a lot of question marks.  You're going to have to bring up some of these question marks.  Of course.  I think the TV series, Alice, was based on it loosely or something, wasn't it?  I don't know.  Is there a few question marks that we have to discuss?  Not on that one. 
[03:24:30]  Not on that one.  In the previous ones, there were a lot of question marks.  But in the top 16, there were no question marks.  Oh, wait.  In the previous list?  There was one called Born Yesterday that I think I might have seen five or ten minutes of.  What was it about?  Couldn't tell you.  The name just sounds familiar.  I don't like the fact that Steve doesn't count a movie if he runs to the bathroom while it's on.  Well, I actually did leave the room for a second.  No, I'm talking about if I saw five minutes of it,  and I'm aware of what it's called, you know, aware of the title because I looked at, you know.  Let's move on.  Thank you.  Okay.  In 12th place, All About Eve.  Oh, Melanie Griffith is in Born Yesterday, so it's got to be a chick flick. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, she's awful.  All About Eve?  All About Eve?  No, I did not.  Classic.  Anyone?  You saw All About Eve, Steve?  No, I saw Born Yesterday.  You did see Born Yesterday.  Melanie Griffith, John Goodman, Don Johnson.  Yeah, I did see that.  What was that about?  A businessman shows up in Washington to lobby agendas that are friendly to his construction plans.  What?  And then his ditzy ex-showgirl bimbo proves to be an embarrassment in social situations,  so he hires a reporter to teach her how to appear more intelligent. 
[03:25:30]  Ugh.  The reporter isn't the only, blah, blah, blah, blah, the love between the two of them.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, Don Johnson spends the whole movie tutoring Melanie Griffith to become this, you know,  very, very intelligent political debate candidate, something.  I don't know.  Ugh.  Terrible movie.  All right, All About Eve?  All About Eve?  No, not me.  Okay.  11th place, The Hours.  Oh, The Hours.  Did anyone see The Hours?  I saw it.  Ah, Jimmy.  It was very good.  What's that about?  Nicole Kidman, it's about- 
[03:26:00]  Stop selling it.  Every movie.  It's very good.  Like, oh, I know you people think it's a chick flick and all, but I saw it very good.  No, but I'll tell you if it's a movie.  So, I don't see that many bad films, so I'm really picky about it when I see it.  Yeah, it was with, I think it was about Virginia Woolf.  Oh, I saw that.  Yeah.  Jesus, Steve.  And the whole Kidman was phenomenal.  Thank God Steve is part of this bit.  He's saving us all today.  I saw it.  Look how excited he gets.  Oh, I saw that one.  Well, no, I just, I can't remember the name.  I can't remember the name.  Yeah, she drowns in the name at some point, right?  And who was the other chick in it?  The one, the other one. 
[03:26:30]  And you liked it?  No.  I thought it was great.  No, I watched it because Nicole Kidman drowned, I think, in the first of the five minutes.  And what are you doing?  I'm writing other movies that I believe should have been on this list.  I'm just putting them in my head because some of them are missing.  Well, yeah, like Bridges of Madison County is on this list.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to the 10th place, Anthony.  I'm not changing my list.  Don't worry, Opie.  Okay.  Now we're going to 10 through 1.  Here we go.  Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, I saw it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  You saw that?  Yeah, yeah.  Steve, you saw that, too?  Yeah, I did, a while ago.  It's 10 years old, I think, at this point.  I don't care.  Is it?  Yeah.  You lifetime-watching faggot.  See, I had to see it.  I had to see it.  I was married at the time.  All right, turn this up a little bit.  And the wife wanted to see it.  But I didn't see it.  What was it about?  It was about Romy and Michelle. 
[03:27:30]  Go back to their high school reunion.  They go to their high school reunion.  I think they had...  Let me get the synopsis here, Opie.  Smeera Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow.  Yeah.  All right.  Two women.  Jesus, dude.  You know the art director.  Jesus.  I know the two main characters.  That's a far cry from art director.  Jesus.  Romy and Michelle have been through it all, including being tortured by the popular crowd  when in high school.  When they receive word of a ten-year reunion, they come to realize their lives aren't as 
[03:28:00]  impressive as they'd like them to be.  Instead of staying home, they go to the reunion with business outfits, cell phones, and one  heck of a bogus success story.  And there you go.  Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow.  1997.  Steve, do you give it a thumbs up?  No.  Not at all.  Does one of them pretend that she's the head of the bus company, and the other one says  she owns her own sanitation business?  I got offices in Akron.  Okay, Romy. 
[03:28:30]  All right.  Ninth place, 50 greatest chick flicks of all time.  Whoa, Michelle.  Trying to find out who has the most on this list.  15 minutes to Monaghan.  Ninth place is a movie called...  By the way, if I see one hand go up for this flick, I'm chopping it off.  Oh, boy.  Well, let's go on to number seven, then.  The truth about cats and dogs.  Oh, boy.  Steve. 
[03:29:00]  I'm in, too.  See?  Thank you.  I'm not alone in this.  Janine Garofalo.  You guys, I'm in, too.  Yeah.  I saw it.  You saw it, too?  Uma Thurman.  Janine Garofalo.  Uma was hot in that movie.  Stop.  Don't even try.  Don't even try.  What was Janine Garofalo's role in that again?  Was she another radio person?  She was a radio host of a...  She played the unattractive, dykey-looking girl.  Oh, yeah.  The part she plays in every movie?  Yeah.  That one. 
[03:29:30]  A successful veterinarian and radio show host with low self-esteem asked her model friend  to impersonate her when a handsome man wants to see her.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, remember?  It was like the Steve Martin movie there.  Yeah, the whole Cyrano de Bergerac thing only reversed.  Roxanne, that was Steve Martin's.  Yeah.  That was funny.  That was funny.  That should be on here.  Yeah.  Oh, and, well, you forgot this part.  Janine Garofalo plays Dr. Abby Barnes, the Truth About Cats and Dogs radio question-and-answer  show host who unwittingly entices a listener over the radio with her soothing voice and personality. 
[03:30:00]  I heard she does a Tony Danza impression and says, take it in the ass.  Some girl, no?  All right, well, I got that one.  Steve's got that one.  I got that one, too.  And Anthony.  Okay.  Keep going up the list because I can tell you right now, I'm out for the rest of this game.  Why?  You said you had a lot in the top 10.  I said I had a lot in the top 10.  Top 20.  Oh, okay.  Eighth place.  I'm done.  Desperately Seeking Susan. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  I did see that one.  Yeah.  Who did back then?  Me.  That was Madonna, right?  You didn't see it?  Why would I?  When it came out?  Absolutely not.  Madonna with the hairy armpits, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was hot.  It wasn't hot.  Maybe if you weren't under a patio sucking another boy's penis.  All right.  That may have taken a...  You would have seen some of these movies.  All right.  Jesus.  Desperately Seeking Monster Rain.  All right.  In seventh place...  Now I'm done. 
[03:31:00]  Damn.  Seventh place, Julia.  Julia?  What the hell is Julia about?  Well...  How are some movies not on this list?  How is Aliens on this and Chocolat is not?  Chocolat.  Chocolat.  Where's Fried Green Tomatoes?  Where's Titanic?  Titanic is a complete chick flick.  All right.  Uh...  Accused.  Julia is a movie...  Oh.  Julia is a movie that centers on Lillian's relationship with her lifelong friend, Julia. 
[03:31:30]  It's a relationship that goes beyond mere acquaintance and one for which the word love seems appropriate.  While Julia attends the university in Vienna, studying with such luminaries as Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein,  Lillian suffers through revisions of her play with her mentor and sometimes lover, Dashiell Hammett, at a New England beach house.  God, does that sound horrid.  After becoming a celebrated playwright, Lillian is invited to a writers' conference in Russia. 
[03:32:00]  Julia, having taken up the battle against fascism...  Fascism.  I know.  Enlists Lillian en route to smuggle...  I'm falling asleep here.  It's a smuggle money through Nazi Germany, which will assist in the anti-cause.  It's a dangerous mission, especially for a Jewish intellectual on her way to communist Russia.  Oh, God.  Doing a brief meeting with Julia.  Oh, stop.  On this trip.  Lillian learns that Julia has had a child, which is called Lily, shortly after returning to the States. 
[03:32:30]  Lillian is informed of Julia's murder.  The details of her death are shrouded in secrecy.  Lillian sadly travels to England to search for her namesake, the child she had promised Julia to care for.  Oh, my God, stop.  I can't take any more.  All right.  In sixth place, The Women.  Nope.  No.  The Women?  Anyone?  Bueller?  No.  What is The Women about?  No?  All right.  Not a clue.  Okay.  Fifth place. 
[03:33:00]  All right.  The English Patient.  I saw that.  You saw The English Patient, Jimmy?  All right.  You're going to sell it now?  I don't remember.  I don't think I liked it.  I thought it was boring.  I saw it after on the Oscar.  Of course it was boring.  I believe it was very boring.  Who was in that?  Ralph Fiennes.  Oh, yeah.  Rafe.  Willem Dafoe.  Was Willem in that?  That's what it says.  If William Dafoe is the movie, it can't be a chick flick.  Oh, of course not.  Yeah.  Colin Firth?  And Steve?  English Patient?  Nope.  Nope.  You piece of shit!  At the close of World War II, a young nurse tends to a badly burned plane crash victim. 
[03:33:30]  His past is shown in flashbacks, revealing an involvement in a fateful love affair.  I remember when this movie was being, the trailers were on television, and they showed  like World War II footage, like it was going to be an action World War II movie.  So at first I'm like, oh, what?  What?  What?  And then I found out what it was about.  It was like a plane crash in a desert or something. 
[03:34:00]  And never saw it.  Right?  Never saw it.  Now, this is on your list, Opie.  No, I did not see it.  Now, I, here's another controversy.  I did not see The English Patient.  I know you saw The English Patient, because I remember you talking about it.  You said you and Sandy went to see it.  It was the most boring, awful chick flick movie you ever saw.  I did not see The English Patient.  I'm telling you.  But I know you did.  She had the DVD.  I might have been on the couch and took a peek.  You saw it in the movies.  I don't.  We did a break on it at N.E.W.  You find us, you find a break where we're talking about me.  Infinity owns the tapes.  How am I supposed to fuck? 
[03:34:30]  Thank God.  I honestly don't remember seeing The English Patient.  I sure hope it's not between one number.  No, Steve's got us beat.  This is ridiculous.  But we have a side bet between the two of us.  Oh, yeah, for $20.  Okay.  Fourth place, The French Lieutenant's Woman.  Anyone?  What is that about?  I don't know.  The synopsis.  Oh, it's over there?  Yeah.  Let's go to number four.  The French Lieutenant's Woman.  A film is being made of a story set in 19th century England 
[03:35:00]  about Charles, a biologist who's engaged to be married,  but who falls in love with outcast Sarah,  whose melancholy makes her leave him after a short but passionate affair.  Anna and Mike, who play the characters of Sarah and Charles,  go, during the shooting of the film,  through a relationship that runs parallel to their characters.  Oh, God damn.  Awful.  Let's just move on, man. 
[03:35:30]  I think I could do that better reading the synopsis with Jim's dick in my mouth.  That just sounds fantastic.  All right.  In third place, 50 greatest chick flicks of all time.  Notorious.  Notorious.  Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious?  Anybody?  It's a chick flick?  I'd see it because it's Hitchcock, but I never did.  All right.  Yeah, I haven't seen it either.  We've got to move on here.  For second place, the runner-up for the greatest chick flick of all time, Camille.  Camille.  Anybody?  Never saw it.  All right.  No?  What's Camille about? 
[03:36:00]  Let's see the synopsis.  It's an old film.  I know that.  1847.  In the gay half-world of Paris,  the gentlemen of the day met the girls of the moment  at certain theater balls and gambling clubs  where the code was discretion, but the game was romance.  This is the story of one of those pretty creatures  who lived on the quicksands of popularity,  Marguerite Gautier,  who brightened her wit with champagne 
[03:36:30]  and sometimes her eyes with tears.  From the novel of Alexandra Dumas,  this is the story which Verdi took for La Triviata.  The Marguerite is a courtesan in Paris.  She falls deeply in love with a young man of promise  when Armand's father begs her not to ruin his...  When Armand's father begs him not to ruin his hope of a career  and positioned by...  Oh, I have no goddamn clue. 
[03:37:00]  I can't even keep track of the friggin' characters.  The top chick flick?  I think I saw that in a play at the Met.  Are you kidding?  Yes, I...  It sounds familiar.  Let me see.  It was about La Triviata.  I saw La Triviata at the Metropolitan Opera,  which doesn't count as the same thing.  It's some culture, you fucks.  All right, the number one chick flick of all time.  Morocco.  Morocco?  What is that about?  Well, why don't you read right there? 
[03:37:30]  Morocco.  Dude.  Dude.  Morocco.  This is the top chick flick, dude, of all time.  Morocco.  The Foreign Legion marches into, uh...  Mogador?  Are we talking about Lord of the Rings?  What?  Mordor?  With booze and women in mind,  just as singer Amy Jolly arrives from Paris  to work Lo Tinto's Cabaret.  That night,  Legionnaire Tom Brown catches 
[03:38:00]  her inimitably seductive,  tuxedo-clad act.  Both bruised by their past lives,  the two edge cautiously  into a no-strings relationship  while being pursued by others.  But Tom must leave on a perilous mission.  It is too late...  Is it too late for them?  Hmm?  Uh, that's all it, uh, says.  That's it?  Yeah.  All right, it sounds very dull.  It's time to get a winner.  Everyone's got their total?  Everyone has their totals.  Let's start with, um...  Very excited now.  Steve will be last. 
[03:38:30]  Let me see if I won.  Ben, how many?  Five.  Ben has seen five.  Ben has seen five of these movies.  The greatest chick flicks of all time.  These fantastic chick flicks.  Uh, Jimmy?  Ten.  Wow.  Ten.  Jimmy saw ten.  But, you know,  nine of them were really cool movies.  I asked the winners,  and I love the acting, and...  Anthony?  I've also seen ten.  Ten?  Ten out of the fifty.  You are going to be forking over some cash to me,  my friend,  because I am eight. 
[03:39:00]  Only eight?  I've seen eight of these movies.  Name your faggy movies.  My fag movies?  Four Weddings and a Funeral.  All right.  Bull Durham by Accident.  Uh-huh.  Thelma and Louise.  Yep.  Aliens.  That isn't a chick flick.  Okay.  Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore When I Was a Kid.  Uh-huh.  Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion,  which I have no excuse for.  The Truth About Cats and Dogs,  which I have no excuse for.  And Desperately Seeking Susan  because it was Madonna back when she was hot.  Okay.  That's it.  Steve?  Shit. 
[03:39:30]  How many, Steve?  Twelve.  Twelve.  We call it the fag dozen.  Wow.  Twelve.  Twelve, but with a lot of question marks, my friend.  Well, I can honestly...  You've seen a piece of most of these movies  according to that sheet in front of you.  As we're doing this,  I'm writing down movies I have seen  that aren't on this list  that would certainly qualify as well.  Like, which ones?  Two Weeks Notice,  Bridges of Madison County,  Roxanne, Titanic, Chocolat,  The Piano, Sweet Home Alabama,  Clueless, Casablanca...  I wouldn't classify The Piano or... 
[03:40:00]  Casablanca.  No, Casablanca, no.  Chocolat was in there?  Yeah.  No, no, he's actually...  No, no, I'm just saying.  This is what I thought of  that wasn't on the list.  Piano wasn't a chick flick.  No?  Yes, it was.  Piano players chased by Nazis.  No, that's The Pianist.  That's The Pianist.  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  No, Piano is...  That was a pretty cool flick.  What?  I didn't see The Pianist?  Yeah, that was pretty good.  I liked that one.  Where he had a, like, you know,  because he didn't...  It was a good one.  Titanic's not a chick flick.  He couldn't play...  Titanic is a chick flick 
[03:40:30]  disguised as an Irwin Allen  disaster movie.  Yeah.  You know.  Of course it's a chick flick.  But it's got enough action in it  that it was holding a male audience.  That's why it did so well.  But it's a chick flick.  Sometimes you'd get into a movie  and go,  oh my God, it's a chick flick.  I was watching a Western once.  I can't remember the name.  But I'm watching and waiting  for a lot of good Western action.  And I was like,  oh my God.  I looked around like,  I fell in...  I'm in a chick flick.  How did it happen? 
[03:41:00]  All right.  They're getting nervous in the booth  because we've got to take  all our breaks today.  Oh.  So, Steve, congratulations.  Thank you.  Steve, the biggest chick flick watcher  here on our program.  I really didn't think  it was going to be that bad.  You have a lot of caution marks  though, too.  All right.  I'll freely admit it.  Let's play, uh,  what did we learn next?  Commune with nature.  And Opie and Anthony.  And Opie and Anthony show.  Feel the love.

[03:42:00]  You're going to forget,  aren't you?  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson  with America's Car Show  tip of the day  on XM Radio.  Ryan from Arlington, Virginia,  writes,  I own a 2000 cheap Cherokee.  Driving to work the other day,  I drove through  spilled paint on the road.  Now I have paint spray  on the bottom of my  passenger side doors  and fenders.  How do I get it off?  Ryan, there are so many  paints out there,  it's hard to say exactly  how to remove  the offending splatter.  Couple of suggestions here.  Try rubbing alcohol,  mix 50-50 with water, 
[03:42:30]  or use a clay bar  with soap and water.  If the paint splatter  is severe enough  and your car finish  is a base coat clear coat,  you can try a little  lacquer thinner on a rag.  Or even oven cleaner  might work.  Avoid leaving these solutions  on for too long  because they can't  soften the finish.  Final suggestion,  wet sand  and buff the affected areas.  But you better know  what you're doing  if you do that.  If you don't,  seek professional help.  Got a question?  Check our website  at americascarshow.com.  Hear the full show  on XM Channel 166, 
[03:43:00]  Saturdays, 2 p.m. Eastern.  So I went to a sex counselor.  Forget about that.  Oh, God.  He prescribed like,  just trying to get intimate again,  like the first couple of weeks,  hay rides, you know.  I mean, it went too slow for me.  It's way too slow.  And the simultaneous orgasm,  I know it's crucial.  I don't know.  Maybe it is.  I don't even know anymore.  I didn't even know  she had an orgasm.  I said, did you have an orgasm?  I don't know.  We shoot a flare over the house soon.  I have to know.  You know,  we tried that orgasm  at the same time.  The doctor told her  to shoot a two-minute warning 
[03:43:30]  in bed,  which is you took away  all the heat, you know.  You want to be hot.  You can't stay hot  for a whole lot.  You can't be hot  with the same person forever.  You have to dip.  I know it gets sort of sad,  you know,  when you say,  can I,  you be the caterer,  I'll be the insurance man,  you know.  You know,  and you come in  with a chef boy,  a jihad,  and a spatula.  It's time,  and then it went south already,  you know.  And I want to express  myself sexually.  That's the key,  to be able to have,  to be myself.  I can't,  I can't,  I yodeled once.  I had a yodel breakthrough. 
[03:44:00]  I yodeled,  and then she came in the room,  and I just,  I panicked.  I just,  I got tongue-tied,  because I just,  I can't be me.  I, you know,  I become like Jerry Lewis.  I can't talk  and make love  at the same time.  I go,  I really,  hell, man,  it's sad,  it's sad.  I, hell,  it's hell,  it's sad.  It's just,  well,  how do you do it?  How do you,  you know,  the best I could ever do,  in the hottest moment,  making love with this woman,  I said to her,  you know,  you're zany and delightful.  I said,  I'm going to get off, 
[03:44:30]  you've been a great audience,  and thank you very much.  Heather.

Greg from New Jersey,  Today I learned  that Tony Danza  likes to put his mule  on the shoulders  of unsuspecting fans.  You know, 
[03:46:30]  the mule.  By the way,  we want to keep  that bit going,  so if you find yourself  around 67th and Columbus,  one fine morning  and you see the people  in line for the  Tony Danza show,  give us a call.  Yeah.  All right?  Just call us.  We have a really,  we have an idea.  If it works,  it's just,  it's just going to get  just ugly.  Oh,  of course it would.  It would be just.  But think of the fun.  Oh,  it would just be classic.  Absolutely classic.  Let's say hi to Ross 
[03:47:00]  in Connecticut.  Hey,  Ross.  Yo,  what's up,  guys?  Hey.  I learned that  four fags plus  talking about chick flicks  equals train wreck radio.  Train wreck radio  at its best.  Choo,  choo.  Well,  it's kind of uncomfortable  to have to try to defend  your movie watching,  you know?  Well,  you got Anthony  talking about a chocolat.  I think he's a closet bag.  I never saw a chocolat  and it wasn't on the list.  Did you see it,  Opie?  No.  Did you see chocolat?  I did not see chocolat.  Didn't see chocolat.  Did you,  Jimmy?  I didn't,  but if I did, 
[03:47:30]  I'd talk about it this weekend  in Sacramento  at the punchline.  Oh,  God.  What?  Friday Saturday.  What a meaty-handed plug  that was.  Oh,  that was some heavy lifting  you just did.  Hey,  who's this?  You,  from South Carolina.  Who are you?  Hello.  Hello.  Hey,  Kampson.  What I learned was...  Whoa,  whoa,  whoa.  Let's slow down a little bit.  What's your name?  Kampson.  You,  you...  Kampson?  You come in your son?  What?  Yep.  I'm a Jap.  Are you? 
[03:48:00]  Yep,  yep.  You're what?  You're Japanese.  Well,  my dad's from Thailand,  so...  Oh,  so you're Thai  and Japanese?  Yep,  yep,  pretty much.  There you go.  All right,  I thought you were like  Middle Eastern.  Nope,  nope,  I'm not a terrorist.  What does your name mean?  I have no fucking clue.  And how do you spell it?  K-O-M-S-A-N.  Kampson.  Were you born here in the States?  Dude,  do you get abused for your name?  Oh,  yeah,  all the time.  Sounds like something 
[03:48:30]  your dad says  when he's getting impatient.  If his neck is getting tired.  Kampson.  Dude,  you might want to change your name,  I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Oh,  I've been saying the same thing  for 21 years,  buddy.  How about deeper,  Mom?  All right,  what did you learn today?  I learned that  Marchini Steve  is a bald-headed fact  that his sexuality  is filled with a bunch  of question marks.  Yep.  Okay,  very good.  Yeah,  that's great.  There goes Kampson.  He's like,  yeah,  that's great.  He knows he just bombed. 
[03:49:00]  Isn't that great?  They know they bombed.  Well,  we can't get past his name.  I don't even know  what he said.  Gunson.  Cliff from Alabama.  What's up,  Cliff?  What's happening,  guys?  How are you?  Hey,  I've been emailing Steve  about this ride-along  you guys are wanting to do.  Yeah,  Steve's getting scared  about the ride-along.  We want to get Steve  in a big rig  and we want him  to take a little trip  across America.  Hey,  Cliff,  is the governor true?  Huh?  I mean,  my conscience  doesn't bother me.  Does it bother you? 
[03:49:30]  Wait a minute,  I'm not from here.  I don't care,  you're in Alabama.  Yeah,  but I've got my feet  off the ground  and I'm not putting them  down until I get out.  All right.  What I learned today  was Steve's still  welcome to come  on the ride-along  by all means,  but no homo movies  are allowed in my truck.  Wow.  Steve,  would you like to go  on a little ride  with Cliff?  Yeah,  I was actually going  to bring that up  in the meeting  after the show.  I sent him an email  yesterday or the day  before he replied to me.  We're going to try  to put it together. 
[03:50:00]  Really?  We'll see.  Steve,  you like Cliff?  I totally like Cliff.  Did he ask you  to send a picture?  Does he want  to see my picture?  Why did you pick  Cliff there, Steve?  I didn't pick Cliff.  What was it about Cliff  that...  Can we stop this?  He just seems  like a nice man  to go across  the country with.  Can I get out  of the barrel now?  Look how you showed  up to work today.  What?  My head was shaved.  Jesus. 
[03:50:30]  What?  Your head is shaved?  You have a flame hat on?  A hat with flames on it?  I've won the hat.  And you won our  fag contest.  And you won out  of the bucket.  Oh, jeez.  He did.  All right.  Well, thank you, Cliff.  We'll work out the details,  okay?  Okay, man.  Have a good one.  All right.  Let's say hi  to Joe in Utah.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  Hey, I learned today  that if you piss off  Jim Norton in the morning,  you get eaten up  and shit out  on a microwavable plate.  Rock on, Jim. 
[03:51:00]  I don't know  if you can ever,  ever stop that one.  Thank you, mister.  All right.  Very good.  Jim was very angry today.  Al Mack from Clifton.  I learned today  going to a photo shoot  is much more good  than going to sell batteries.  Very nice.  Let's say hi to Rob  on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, man.  How you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  Hi.  Okay.  I learned that  if you lick the shaft  and you lick the balls,  you're still sucking dick.  Wow.  Oh, wait.  And I also learned 
[03:51:30]  another thing.  I learned that you guys  are a bunch of  pillow-biting faggots.  You guys suck.  Why, sir?  All right.  Pillow-biting faggots.  Let's say hi to Wade  in New Hampshire.  Wade?  Hey.  Hey, what's up, dudes?  That's my deal, Wade.  Norton, you're the best, man.  Thanks, Wade.  Oh, those are some  sweet numbers, eh?  Come on, Wade.  That's my deal.  Oh, come on.  I learned today  that Raquel's ass  looks like she was  just sitting on  a gravel driveway.  Nice.  Yep.  And she's a bitch.  Well, it goes without 
[03:52:00]  saying, sir.  Nice.  Thank you.  I still kind of like Raquel.  Well, love you, Norton.  Love you, too, fella.  Bullets all come.  Bye, mister.  Bye.  Booch from Philly  has learned that  there will be  two empty seats  in the VIP section  at the Tony Danza show today.  That was very funny.  Also,  Tony Danza's cock  has a SAG card.  Learn that.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Let's say hi  to Doug in Boston.  Hey, Doug. 
[03:52:30]  What's up, gentlemen?  So is Curry  going to pull it out  or what?  I don't fucking care.  There you go.  I don't want him there.  I'd rather have Bush.  Then again,  I like Bush anyway.  Oh, no.  Hey, you know.  That old gag.  Hey, little Jimmy.  Hi, fella.  All right, what do you got?  I learned today  that your sponsors  are on a payment plan.  This week,  they paid for the airtime  and next week  they pay for the audio.  Yeah, I know.  A little dead air.  Very good.  A little dead air.  Hey, are you done  partying yet?  Yeah, I didn't party hard.  It was more 
[03:53:00]  the Yankees win  was better.  Yeah, that's what  all you guys from Boston  are saying,  that the Yankees win  kind of took away  from the World Series win.  It was like the Yankees.  No, beating the Yankees  was like the big thing.  That was your World Series  and then winning  the World Series  is just kind of,  eh, well.  All right.  Well, thanks, Doug.  All right, man.  Go Sox.  John in Connecticut, hey.  Hey, I learned  that the reason  Bill's dead  is because some trucker  was trying to figure out  a rhyme for break. 
[03:53:30]  Hmm.  Did you stump us today?  Hmm.  We didn't even do  the Bill's dead  or anything.  I don't know.  Maybe someone out there  is getting it.  I don't know.  Congratulations.  Your call was a fine rhyme  for pink.  Hey, this is straight Marco.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, I want to ask  Cliff the truck diver  if he's ever been to Brooklyn  and if he's ever shot  two Colombian drug dealers.  Wow, that's going back a ways.  Eddie the murderer, right?  Oh, fucking, hey, Norton.  Please. 
[03:54:00]  Wow, he really thought  that was going to work.  He was all excited.  Oh, wait, like I'm supposed to...  He had to think up some setup  to get on the air.  So he did that.  And then he was like,  oh, Norton.  Waiting for Norton to say,  yes, sir, so we can hang up on you.  Doesn't work.  You're impervious.  Not going to happen.  All right, I think we're out of here.  Wait.  Are we?  Yeah, I think we should leave.  Oh, jump in, Yemeni.  Are any of the election results in yet?  We already announced  Bush is the winner.  Yes, we did. 
[03:54:30]  We announced it  at the beginning of our show today.  With all the research that we did,  we were the first show  to announce that  Bush is the winner.  Okay.  Oh, oh, right.  And then you guys could take it from here?  Mm-hmm.  You could figure it out?  Yep, go ahead.  It'll never work.  Sticker stops.  I threw all that stuff out.  Why, Opie?

All right.  Well, we'll see you guys tomorrow  for Whip Him Out Wednesday.  I didn't see Shuck a lot.  That was Rick.  People are trying to say  I saw it.  No, you did not see that.

[03:58:30]  Because of my father  I thought my name was Jesus Christ  When I come in the living room and trip and fall  And he said, Jesus Christ  Can't you walk  Be eating dinner and go to grab a piece of bread 
[03:59:00]  And a water glass and be in your way  And just knock it over  And Jesus Christ  Clean the water up  So we moved from Stewart Street to the projects  And the kids in the neighborhood said  What's your name?  And I said, Jesus Christ  And he said, your name ain't no Jesus Christ 
[03:59:30]  I said, yes it is  Come on to my house  I brought twenty kids in the living room  And my father, Jesus Christ  And then from age seven to fifteen  I thought my father was a psychologist  Because he'd look at me and say
