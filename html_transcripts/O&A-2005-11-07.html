<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing their low morning energy levels. Opie blamed his sleep deprivation on “Kennedy eyes” and straining to read his Blackberry. This led to a conversation about the negative impact of small screens on eyesight and a nostalgic reflection on the simplicity of pre-cell phone communication, segueing into a moon landing conspiracy theory debate.  They then humorously discussed their excessive phone ownership, with Opie referencing his "live-in whore chef" and her culinary skills.  Comedian Bill Burr joined the show, and the conversation shifted to his busy schedule and upcoming appearances, including a Patriots-Colts game.  The hosts criticized the New York Jets' performance and mocked participants in the New York City Marathon, particularly those in wheelchairs, after a listener called in to report seeing an Opie and Anthony banner at the marathon.  Another caller recounted a bizarre story of his friends having sex in the room while he was on the phone, leading to a live audio broadcast of the sexual activity, punctuated by the hosts' and caller's comments.  The show then covered the recent Midwest tornadoes, featuring an interview with a survivor who described her experience escaping a tornado in her mobile home, interspersed with the hosts' humorous commentary.  This was followed by discussions of a man suing after being glued to a toilet seat, and a Somali pirate attack on a cruise ship, with the hosts mocking pictures of the pirates. The show's "Assault on the Media" segment was then discussed, with the hosts defending their actions and criticizing negative feedback.  They also debated the differences between online and in-person racism and the role of internet anonymity in emboldening hateful behavior.

The show continued with a discussion about overtly racist messages online, and the hosts debated the line between intended humor and hateful expression. This transitioned into a detailed defense of their "assault on the media" stunt in East Orange, NJ, where they interrupted a news report on a child killed in a police chase. No Filter Paul, a participant in the stunt, called in to defend their actions, arguing the news report was sensationalist. They discussed online reactions, the location, and the reporters' reactions.  Other topics included a contest with prizes like MiFi devices and dinner with E-Rock; the absurd negativity of the New Jersey governor's race ads, particularly one featuring Corzine's ex-wife; a caller's amused observation of the hosts in East Orange; caller perspectives on police brutality and the media; Opie's purchase of an AR-15 rifle and his range experience, including the magazine limit and his use of an EOTech sight; a discussion on New Jersey assault weapons laws;  Opie's brother's interrupted viewing of *The Godfather*; and Opie's experience at his nephew's violent seven-year-old tackle football game.

A later segment focused on the violence at a seven-year-old's football game, transitioning into a discussion about shooting ranges and the increasing number of female participants. Opie shared a humiliating childhood football experience. Callers Andy and Betty shared similar experiences with overly competitive youth sports, leading to reminiscences about brutal gym classes, the presidential fitness test, and early sexual experiences, including Opie’s first strip club visit at age 13.  The main topic then became the lawsuit filed by Bob Daugherty, who glued his buttocks to a toilet seat, with audio of his interview played and the hosts' reactions included. This led to a discussion of the $3 million lawsuit, the absurdity of the interview, and a related story about a man whose penis was glued to his stomach and buttocks. Details of the latter incident and the $46,200 settlement were discussed by a purported juror, Les.  The segment concluded with criticism of a recent George Carlin special and a humorous moment where Opie destroyed a CD player.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a critical review of a George Carlin special, with the hosts and Bill Burr playing clips and debating whether Carlin's stream-of-consciousness style was still funny. Numerous callers shared similar opinions, focusing on the special's lack of traditional jokes and overly cynical tone. The conversation included tangents on other comedians (Bill Hicks, Robin Williams) and musical artists (Nickelback, AC/DC).  This segued into a segment about Tara Reid's "Paradise" show, playing clips showcasing Reid's often inaccurate and nonsensical travel commentary. The hosts mocked Reid's perceived lack of intelligence and numerous misinterpretations of historical facts.  A caller compared Reid's voice to Corky from *Life Goes On*, followed by a brief call with Bill Burr, ending with a heated exchange about his limited appearances on the show.  A final segment focused on more of Tara Reid's European trip audio, filled with complaints about weak drinks, dilapidated historical sites (including her description of the Parthenon as a "fixer-upper"), and general obliviousness, punctuated by the hosts' sarcastic and vulgar reactions.  The segment concluded with Burr accidentally breaking a glass picture frame.

[00:03:30]  THE END 
[00:04:00]  THE END 
[00:04:30]  Oh, a high-energy Monday morning edition. 
[00:05:00]  That's right. That's what we do on Mondays, to sound more energetic.  Right, we talk about how energetic we are and try to talk faster.  Actually, I'm feeling pretty good for a Monday. 
[00:05:30]  If I stay up late on Saturday, if I stay up late on Saturday, I'm going to sleep in late Sunday, I can't get to sleep Sunday night.  So, it ends up in the end of the day, I can't get to sleep in the night, I can't get to sleep in the night, I can't get to sleep in the night.  I have Kennedy eyes, I can't get to sleep in the night.  I can't get to sleep in the night, I can't get to sleep in the night, I can't get to sleep in the night, I can't get to sleep in the night, I can't get to sleep in the night, I can't get to sleep in the night, I can't get to sleep in the night. 
[00:06:00]  Say hi and interview us and do a little B-roll.  I don't know.  I don't know.  We'll see what happens with that.  Who knows?  I've got to go to the eye doctor because there's stupid Blackberry.  They're going crazy.  Ah, see?  You've got Blackberry syndrome.  What is it?  People are getting it.  What is it?  It's looking at a small little fucking screen with type that's the size of Pinhead and trying to read it.  All of a sudden, I can't see as well.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  That screws your eyes up.  Is that what they're saying?  Yeah.  There's a whole story about that.  Where?  You've got the Trio 650.  Oh, really?  I had the Trio.  I hated the Trio.  Yeah?  Yes, I hated it.  But your eyes didn't hurt when you had that.  My eyes are fine with my cell phone.  But I didn't have the Trio 650, so maybe that's the difference.  You know, people's eyes never used to get hurt by the telephone.  The big ringing one in your house.  And everything got done.  Business got accomplished.  We actually ran a civilization without the need of little tiny screens to fuck our eyes up and video on demand. 
[00:07:00]  And little cell phones that people can get every day.  Didn't burn a hole in your brain.  No.  No tumor in your head because of the fucking phone.  Never once did you hear about the big heavy bell telephone giving you a tumor.  Yeah.  And half the phone calls we make is just a waste of time.  It's a waste of time.  It really is.  Everything got done.  We ran through wars.  We got to the goddamn moon. 
[00:07:30]  The moon.  No, we didn't.  Yes, we did.  No, the flag is flapping.  You're a lying sack of shit.  And if you believe any of that conspiracy crap.  There's not gravity.  And the flag is flapping.  The soundstage.  Right.  And they gave him...  Ed Harris was playing the part of that.  Yes.  Yes.  But you're right.  A lot got done.  A lot got done because every phone call you made had a purpose to it.  Yeah, and you had to wrap it up.  Like, if you had to take a shit, you wouldn't continue talking on it.  Right.  Like, half the guys at the airports that I go by. 
[00:08:00]  Wrap it up.  Taking a shit.  Their voice is clearly echoing.  You're clearly in a toilet stall.  That's just a level of, like, uninhibitedness in a public bathroom.  Yes.  There's, like, 18 other people in there.  And you're like, yeah, I'm going to be there about nine.  You know, I got this spreadsheet ready.  Can we push it back an hour?  Can we push it back an hour?  But when you used to make a phone call, it was like a reason. 
[00:08:30]  There was a reason.  I kind of recall making phone calls, and every time you dialed it, there was a reason.  You needed to be picked up.  You needed to be dropped off.  You needed some kind of business was being done.  Well, nowadays, when you leave the house without your cell phone, you go into panic mode, right?  Oh, yeah.  But then by the end of the day or the end of that visit or whatever, you realize, oh, I didn't really need it.  I would have just wasted it and made four or five calls to people for no reason.  If there's an emergency, emergency, there was always the pay phone, you know, out on the street somewhere, and you'd grab that. 
[00:09:00]  Now, I can't even tell you how many phones I have.  The BlackBerry is a phone, right?  Yes.  The BlackBerry.  I have one of those.  I have my cell phone.  I have my house phone.  I have a satellite phone for when the race war comes and all the communications are broken down.  That actually comes in handy on cruises and my getaways into the Caribbean and some of those places where you don't get cell access. 
[00:09:30]  Upstate New York.  Well, why would you need a phone in those situations?  Well, I just went to the Grand Cayman Islands.  In those cases, you do want to have some kind of communication.  I went to the Grand Cayman Islands, and I didn't need a phone.  I was on a cruise once talking with our super agent, Bob Eatman, wheeling and dealing.  Like I said, why would you need a phone in that situation?  It's useless.  It's useless.  My car is a phone.  My car itself has a phone in it.  I think I'm up to five.  You press the little button on the rear view mirror, and I say, call. 
[00:10:00]  And then it prompts me to which number, and I go, Opie.  And then it just calls.  I don't have to look at anything.  I don't have to touch anything.  And I just talk in the car, and the whole car is the phone.  It's amazing.  Yeah, I have the other car is a phone also.  So two cars, two phones.  All right, now I'm up to six.  There's six phones so far.  Six phones, and push came to shove.  The computer's a phone. 
[00:10:30]  So seven.  Seven phones.  You've got seven ways to talk to people.  I have seven phones.  And you still don't talk to anybody.  One phone.  Do you get seven different bills?  Yeah, I think so.  I think I do.  Yeah.  Seven different phone bills.  It's kind of wasteful.  And that doesn't count my girlfriend's cell phone also.  So now we're up to eight phones.  We've got eight phones.  This is ridiculous.  Oh, that live-in whore chef of yours.  She's got a phone.  Stop it.  See, a little booty call. 
[00:11:00]  You've got to have your private phone that you make your booty call to.  Booty call.  That little hussy of a chef that you have.  No.  You know a chef is dressed like a French maid.  She is not.  She's a lovely lady.  She cleans up after she makes the eggs.  No, she's a lovely lady that cooks wonderful food on Monday.  Thank you very much.  She cooks for the week on Monday?  Yeah.  And she just shrink wraps all of it?  No, it's in the, like Tupperware type stuff. 
[00:11:30]  No, it's good stuff.  Works.  No, it isn't.  It's like beets.  No, it's not beets.  I've never cooked beets for you?  I've never had a beet.  She cooks beets for you?  Look at you.  You've got like 0% body fat.  That's right.  It's all that horrendous shit.  That's from beets.  Broccoli.  That's from beets.  Broccoli.  Broccoli.  I do eat a lot of sushi.  All right.  Well, we've got to say hi to Bill Burr.  Bill is back.  What's going on?  With us.  Right.  Well, Bill's back for a day.  That's it?  We wanted Bill all week, but he's here for a day.  What happened?  Then he jets off to somewhere else.  I don't know. 
[00:12:00]  He's the only comedian that shows up to the Opie and Anthony program with luggage.  Oh, yeah.  All the time.  Now he just pulls it in.  That's a good thing to me.  All right.  I have to come clean.  I've added props to my act.  I had a gig late last night.  I'm sorry.  Toilet ball with wheels and pedals or something.  I think Carrot Top's getting a little tired.  I'm going to pick up the slack.  Like Gallagher, too.  Yeah.  He sold me his act.  Every time you roll in with the luggage, I have to acknowledge it, too.  Like, luggage.  Because no other comedian comes in here with luggage.  I know.  He's very busy.  It's like, we had a real look of disappointment. 
[00:12:30]  It's like, what are you doing?  It's Monday morning, and you've got luggage.  He's jetting out of here the second he leaves.  So we got him today, and then hopefully all next week we're looking into that.  Yeah.  Where do you go to right after the show?  I have to go out to L.A. tomorrow, but tonight I'm actually going up for that Patriots-Colts game.  Oh, you are?  Oh, really?  Nice.  Hey, you know, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, you know.  Yeah.  A little football game up there.  Your buddies.  I see you got the hat.  Yeah, your pats don't have a chance.  Oh, yeah, because we're injured.  The Colts are a powerhouse.  Oh, yeah, we're injured. 
[00:13:00]  We're big-time injured, and now Peyton's finally going to beat us, and they're going to act  like he actually beat the Patriots rather than an injured version of it.  In the end, it'll look like a win.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, he's a whining, whining individual.  My Jets looked good yesterday, so I'm pretty happy today.  Two and six, are they?  Two and six, yes.  Six, Jets.  Yeah, real smart.  Fourth and goal, and you need a touchdown to win the game, or you lose, and you try the  hardest play in football.  That's brilliant.  What, they run the Statue of Liberty play?  The old throw it to the corner of the end zone, and let's see who can kick it. 
[00:13:30]  Did they do that like four times, though?  Let's see who can catch it and keep their feet in bounds.  That's a brilliant play to call as the last play of the game.  It wasn't fourth and goal.  Fire Herm Edwards!  It's time!  Fire him!  Sorry.  They were first down, right?  It was first and goal, basically.  Yeah, first and goal, and they blew it.  Throwing that, what is it called?  It's called a timing pass to the corner of the end zone?  The one that everybody knows? 
[00:14:00]  And then it's a...  The one, unless you have Randy Moss, it's going to be incomplete.  Unless you've got a guy that can jump 12 feet.  I hate that play.  I mean, it works, yes.  But fourth and goal, last play of the game.  Stupid play call.  And the Jets lose again.  That's because you have Steve DeBerg for a quarterback.  Who?  No, he didn't even play.  Vinny didn't even play.  It was Bollinger, who played actually pretty well for the Jets this time around.  Brian Seip.  And Krebed might have played his last game.  Another concussion, it looks like. 
[00:14:30]  Done.  Another concussion.  He used to be a friend of this show, by the way.  He used to come in and say hi to us from time to time.  I hope him the best.  What about Terrell Owens?  I don't know.  What's that story about?  He...  I don't know.  Somebody, Michael Irvin, I guess, on ESPN said if Brett Favre was the quarterback of  the Eagles, they'd be undefeated.  And then T.O. went on TV and basically agreed.  Going, oh yeah.  Basically.  Isn't he like gone right now? 
[00:15:00]  That's why he's suspended?  Yeah, so they suspended him.  Right.  And then the Eagles lose.  But they're trying to say that the Eagles are better without him, so...  No, whatever.  Oops.  Whatever.  A couple other big stories.  The New York City Marathon.  Hey.  Yeah, how'd that go?  You know how I...  So happy I don't live in any of the boroughs anymore, by the way.  Just want to get that out.  I used to live in Brooklyn.  You are just caged in a certain area in the entire borough.  You just don't like to be festive.  No, no, festive's one thing. 
[00:15:30]  The whole city comes out for the New York City Marathon.  They cut your whole borough in half.  It's the only day of the year you see everyone happy, smiling, cheering on other...  How about trying to cross the street?  Cheering other New Yorkers on.  Oh, fuck them.  You barely leave your apartment.  You don't need to cross the street.  There were times where I would have to drive, maybe get something to eat or something, and  I'd be like, oh, right, it's Marathon Day.  You can't use the bridge, you can't do this, you can't...  Ah, you can't leave.  It's a very festive day in New York.  Festive.  I don't mind that they shut down the city for the New York City Marathon. 
[00:16:00]  I mind when it's all those dumb parades every weekend.  Well, see, now those people would say that that's festive.  Yeah, but do you need a...  The Guatemalan Day?  I was going to say, I actually was going to use that as an example, too.  The Guatemalan Day Parade, what?  Guatemalan.  Puerto Rican Day Parade, okay.  Is the falafel just claimed by everybody now, every race?  Because during every one of these street fairs, no matter what the nationality, you walk  down the street and they're selling falafel.  Yeah, all those middle ground, those gray area races.  Yeah.  I don't know what they are, but you just shouldn't be selling falafel. 
[00:16:30]  Portuguese Day.  Who's showing up?  You stumble on those.  It's a city.  Yeah.  It's a city street.  Those aren't like festive things that people want to go to.  It's white, black, and Puerto Rican.  Yeah.  Any other parade?  Yeah.  The German one?  Ah, that's fair.  For the rest of the country, every weekend, there's a parade in New York City.  Every weekend.  It's like parade season.  But the New York City Marathon, you know how I kind of blade through the park some days?  Uh-huh.  And they're still running.  They're still running to the finish line. 
[00:17:00]  Stop it.  And I couldn't help myself, so I looked at this one person, and I go, why are you still  running?  No one cares, and no one's watching.  They're still.  I'm going to finish.  But of course, they'll be there for the last runner to come in.  But all those people in between, no one cares.  They don't even have the lights on at the finish line anymore.  Is the clock gone and everything?  They got the guys.  They're just trying to clean up.  Yeah.  And these people, they're not even running, actually.  They just kind of walk the whole thing.  Like the guy at the party that won't leave.  And I don't want to hear your crap. 
[00:17:30]  It's, you know, any one of us could have just walked a marathon.  Any one of us.  Yeah, with enough time, sure.  If you're not running the thing, then you shouldn't be in the thing.  Uh-huh.  Simple as that.  Uh-huh.  Or we all should just take a Sunday stroll and do the New York City Marathon.  Yeah.  Any person listening to this can pretty much, you know, compete.  Yeah, there should be a limiting amount of time that you can walk where they just,  all right, buddy.  Yeah.  Yeah, pack it in.  It's over.  Yeah, they come up to you.  They wrap that aluminum foil around you.  Yeah.  Put you in a cab.  Go home.  But these people are still out there.  I saw a bunch of them coming in, and there's no lights on at the finish line, and the guys 
[00:18:00]  are just trying to clean up the area.  Yeah.  And they're coming in.  But all the news crews will definitely be there for the last runner, which will be,  what, maybe tomorrow?  Yeah.  When we all forgot about the New York City Marathon, they'll say, but one brave runner.  No, it's going to be this chick, Zoe.  She does it every year.  She's a publicity whore.  Oh.  Wow.  And every year they make believe.  That's how it can be.  And every year they make believe.  She should rape somebody.  Every year they make believe that, you know, wow, what an amazing woman. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  The media knows this woman.  She does it every year.  Yeah, that's her gig.  That's her gig.  This is her, like, big yearly appearance.  It gets to the point where if there's someone a little slower than her, she'll back way off,  or she'll sit down on the curb for four hours.  That's what she'll do.  No way.  Oh, fuck yeah.  It's all about coming in last.  That's like, yeah, if somebody comes in more last than her, then she's not the last anymore.  I suggest they give the NYPD, like, cattle prods for all the... 
[00:19:00]  See if they're faking it or not?  Well, you know, if they're slowing down a little too much and, you know, trying to be the last runner,  you give them a little shot.  A little shot in the ass.  A little shot in the ass.  See if they really got it in.  Move it along, fatso.  No, we've got to clean up the streets.  It's not about you.  I have to admit, I don't want to be a dick or anything, but, you know, if you are in a wheelchair,  I mean, come on.  I guess uphill is more difficult, but...  I would gather.  It's like a scooter, you know? 
[00:19:30]  I could do 26 miles.  Who couldn't?  Well, they're doing it...  You're riding.  Anthony and I used to talk about the marathon, especially when we were in Boston.  I think if you're going to be in the marathon and in a wheelchair, it should be like a wheelchair.  Like the old style, Raymond Burr, Ironside wheelchair.  Yeah.  Yeah, with the two flip things for your feet in the front.  Right.  These things are...  Yeah.  These things are state-of-the-art with the wheels bent just so, so they can go fast.  They paddle with their hands.  They paddle with their hands, which isn't easy, obviously.  I don't think any of us could paddle, you know, use our hands in a wheelchair for 26 miles. 
[00:20:00]  They're racing wheelchairs, though.  But I think it should just be a separate race that they do another time a year.  Yeah, but you can glide down hills.  Yeah, they go flying down hills.  I could ride a bike 26 miles.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah.  Right.  I agree.  And how many...  There's no mountains here in the five boroughs.  Right.  You know you're not going to really be tackling any mountains.  No.  Let's say hi to Chris in New Jersey.  The cripples.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, O&A.  Bill Burr.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Chris?  Yesterday, flipping through the channels, New York City Marathon, last stretch, just make out 
[00:20:30]  an O&A banner on the side there.  It was great.  See the XM?  Yeah.  The pass of this program, they were working on that for over a month, over a month and  a half.  It was their secret mission.  They were going to have a huge Opie and Anthony display at the New York City Marathon.  Yeah.  And a third of an O&A banner was seen for maybe a half a second.  Oh, boy.  No, I don't know how long.  I didn't see the clip.  Mission failure.  And now they're all yelling and screaming at each other on the board.  I saw a little infighting going on. 
[00:21:00]  A lot of infighting saying, hey, to all you dicks that said you would be there Sunday,  you let us down, you let Opie and Anthony down, you let the fellow pests down.  Hey, it was cool.  It was my first live, bud.  You said you were going to be there.  All right.  My first live assault on the media is cool.  All right.  What?  It was the first assault on the media.  Oh, he did it?  I guess.  He was involved.  Oh.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Let's say hi to Jason and Teresa from California.  Jason, Teresa, what's up?  Hey, man. 
[00:21:30]  This is Jason's friend, Phillip, right now, man.  They are going at it right now, dude.  They are going at it on my bed.  Should I hand you the phone or what's going on, my friends?  California.  It's a little early, right?  It's like 4.  Yeah, dude.  So you guys are still all drunk from last night?  Oh, you know it, man.  We've been drinking all night, Bill Burr.  Jason, what have we been doing?  We've been putting that shit on the table.  On the table.  You know it.  You guys want to hear from them?  They're having sex right now.  No bullshit.  Wait, your friend is having sex right in front of you? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, dude, they're having sex right in front of me, dude.  I'm about to whack my back, Jimmy Norton style.  So why are you in the room?  Because I'm a pervert, fatso, that can't get laid by himself.  Hmm.  All right, so your friend and his chick are going at it?  Yeah.  Here, let me hand the phone to my friend Jason, who's getting it right now.  Here he is.  Here's Jason on the table.  Hello.  What's up, Jason?  How you doing?  Hey.  Explain what's going on. 
[00:22:30]  I'm having sex right now, dude.  I've got a girl on top of me.  Oh.  Can you hear her?  Yeah, we don't need to hear you, bro.  She sounds like it.  That other guy, he didn't have the energy like he was watching two people.  Sounded like he was still at the marathon.  All right, you guys are live nationwide.  We'll shut up for a little while.  All right.  All right. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  Oh, he's back.  He's back on our spot.  He missed it there for a minute.  No, he's going to start over again.  Keep rolling, count on yourself. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, shit.  No, she didn't come.  Put her on the phone.  Hello?  Hello?  Hey, you're getting fucked?  I am.  Give me the phone door.  No, I'm doing the fucking. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, you're doing the fucking.  Oh, I'm on top.  Why don't you, I hate doing this.  Sometimes it backfires.  Why don't you tell everybody exactly what you look like?  Oh, let's just say, I have blonde curly hair, long.  Uh-huh.  I got nice boobs.  And a great fucking ass.  Well, how much are you away?  How tall are you?  Yeah, height and weight. 
[00:24:30]  Height and weight.  5'7", about 130.  All right.  And what kind of boobs you got?  Yeah, how old a gal are you?  I'm 20.  20?  Yeah.  No kids, right?  No, not at all.  Is this your boyfriend or just a hookup?  Just a hookup.  You guys just know each other?  Yeah.  And why, how, what's that other guy doing? 
[00:25:00]  I don't know.  Do you find it a little weird that the third, that a third person's in there just watching you?  Oh, he left.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  Do you think you'll be a mom someday?  Someday, yeah.  You can tell your kids about this?  Yeah, why not?  Probably.  You guys want the big finale or what?  You're live across America.  Yes, sir.  You want to switch positions?  What position do you like? 
[00:25:30]  We'll do doggy style.  All right.  All right.  All right, this should get some action going.  A little doggy style for you.  All right, you keep the phone, all right?  We don't want to hear him.  You talk to him.  All right.  All right.  So where are the other guys in the background?  Yeah, he should have like perverted energy.  Oh, yeah, they're over there fucking right now.  He's just like, oh, my God.  Like the guy in Pulp Fiction that just stood there going, yeah, fuck them.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  Fuck.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  He's pounding that.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:26:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Hello, exactly. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, what happened to them?  What happened?  They better call back.  Oh, my God.  They can't leave us now.  I don't think he can close the deal with her, you know?  I don't think he can make her come.  She sounded like she was enjoying herself, but maybe she wasn't really building it.  Yeah, just...  Maybe she hung up the phone by accident?  Could you make another noise, please?  Besides...  How about a... 
[00:27:30]  Maybe they'll call back.  She kept building up like she was gonna.  Yeah.  Then she'd go back to...  He'd be like, fuck.  All right, as we wait for them to call back...  I think they're gonna call back.  I don't think they meant to hang up.  Hopefully.  The other big story is this tornado.  Holy crap.  Just destroying complete neighborhoods down there in...  Where was the tornado?  Kansas.  Kansas.  Was it? 
[00:28:00]  Parts of Indiana, I think.  Indiana.  Yeah.  Is this the most disasters you've ever seen in the last couple months?  I mean, is Jesus coming or what?  There's no predicting this shit either.  These tornadoes, they just can't...  They got kind of a line on it.  Yeah, we got a warning out or this or these thunderstorms are happening.  But they just pop down whenever they fucking want.  All right, hold on a minute.  That's it.  And then you're dead.  Hey, what happened to you guys?  Hello?  Sorry.  Why are you guys whispering?  No, we weren't whispering. 
[00:28:30]  I just...  I accidentally hit the phone closed.  Oh, all right.  Because I was orgasming, so...  Oh, yeah?  So we missed the orgasm?  Yeah.  All right, thank you.  So anyway, talking about tornadoes...  Now they're all yelling at each other.  Do we need to talk to them if we missed the orgasm?  No.  They're saying this one, the wind's got up to, what, 200 plus miles an hour?  Yeah.  They just come swooping in?  Yeah.  But you were saying that you see the thunderstorms in the distance and... 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  And you're done.  They can't predict them.  It's not like a hurricane where you can see it coming.  You know, they just...  See it coming.  And watch it for 12 days.  Yeah, I was going to say, you can see it coming for two weeks.  I know.  These things just, you know, come down, give you more than hurricane force winds in, you  know, a matter of minutes.  Yeah.  And then it's gone and it's sunny out and you're looking around at just disaster going,  what the fuck happened?  Yeah, it's a one night stand disaster. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, you've been fucked.  Have fun.  One night stand disaster.  Hurricane's like the relationship.  It's like 70s.  How the fuck did I get into this?  It goes all my shit.  Heading towards an engagement, could be heading towards a breakup.  I think it's going to touch down in New Orleans.  Yeah.  So they, whenever they can't really warn people, when they come out of the blue like that,  people do die.  And that's what happened. 
[00:30:00]  Well, sometimes you look in the distance at the thunderstorm clouds and stuff.  Yeah.  And sometimes you feel like, oh my God, that looks like it could turn into a tornado at  any given moment.  Yeah, but here, you know.  I've been in a place besides here, Anthony.  Really?  I'm not talking about tornadoes in New York.  It really happens.  Have you been in Tornado Alley?  Not Tornado Alley, though.  Yeah, that's kind of.  Just when I'm on vacation and stuff, you start seeing the clouds in the distance.  Yeah.  Man, that looks like that's something that could happen.  That looks like it might be a tornado or some kind of, what is it called? 
[00:30:30]  Water spout?  Water spout.  Or spout.  They get those things.  You get like pussy tornadoes every so often.  I like when they say, and was it a tornado that touched down in New Jersey last night,  destroying a car and a tree or something?  And they try to make it sound like it's a big deal, like it was a tornado.  It's like, yeah, a little wind.  Perhaps it was in a circular motion, but, you know, take a look at a real tornado,  like what happened over there.  Yeah.  That's the real deal. 
[00:31:00]  Well, they're interviewing the survivors all over Morning TV.  Survivors.  And they just interviewed a lady.  She had to be 400 plus pounds easily from her hospital bed.  Disasters love fat people.  So what was it like to live through that tornado?  We turn now to Joan Fultz, a survivor recovering at Deaconess Hospital in Evansville, Indiana.  Joan, I understand some insomnia on Sunday morning may have saved your life.  I believe so.  Sleep apnea. 
[00:31:30]  Insomnia.  Yeah.  Listen, you can hear how fat she is.  I believe so.  Yeah.  What happened?  Well, I had heard that there was a tornado warning in Kentucky.  I wasn't too concerned because at first they said it was going to hit the west side of Evansville.  And I live on the southeast side.  Okay.  And just a few minutes before it hit, they said it was going to be between the Henderson Bridge  and Newburgh, Indiana. 
[00:32:00]  And that's exactly where my mobile home park is.  Of course it is.  So when you heard there was a tornado.  Her mobile home park.  What is up with that?  You know, she had a big package of Oreos in front of her.  Oh, yeah.  And then there came deadly discs.  Deadly chocolate discs.  My Oreos went spinning off at hundreds of miles per hour.  Killed my dog and bedded right in his forehead.  I know a lot.  Thank God it wasn't double stuff.  I know a lot of hack comedians do that joke about why do you live in Tornado Alley. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, the trailers.  Especially if it's a trailer where you can just move the trailer.  Yeah.  But why?  Yeah.  Like, why?  It's the lightest weight little tin can homes in an area where, yeah, there are hurricanes.  But more importantly, you can move out of there is the point if you have a trailer for the most part.  Yeah.  Because even if your home is, you know, anchored down nice, it's still going to get destroyed in a tornado, right?  Yeah.  I don't think those trailers can really be moved very quickly.  No.  Yeah.  Those are the ones that have been there for, like, generations and generations. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, you know.  Any truck that can pull it away got repoed years earlier.  The wheels are gone off of it, you know.  They're up on the cinder blocks.  Yeah, you've got to go old school.  Just go out and chain yourself to a tree.  Yeah, that's it.  Get a fat tree.  Catch a fat woman.  Hibachi to the side of your head.  So when you heard there was a tornado in the area, even though you didn't think it was going to hit you, what did you do?  Started praying.  Eight. 
[00:33:30]  And then when I found out that it was going to be coming toward us, I went to my closet.  And I just had barely got in the closet when there was a push of wind.  And then it just, a bam, you know, just that fast.  And I was turning and flying around.  No, you weren't.  Like, I didn't really feel any pain.  And I don't know how long I laid there before, you know, anything else happened because I know I was knocked out for a little bit. 
[00:34:00]  But I don't think it was that long, but neighbors from other streets came over and started helping us.  How much, like, white trash product, what white trash product, was it a George Foreman grill that actually knocked him unconscious at 70 miles an hour?  Some sort of awful fucking onion slicer.  I think it was the singing bass thing you could buy on TV. 
[00:34:30]  Billy Bass?  Billy Bass.  Oh, Billy Bass, that's right.  It's called Billy Bass.  Hello, baby.  A little more from this brave survivor.  Fucking deer antler.  It sounds like you're describing something from the Wizard of Oz.  I mean, you say you were spun around.  Did it actually lift your mobile home up and turn it?  My house was terrific.  It was moved about three or four streets.  And I understand you had a couple of close calls in all of this.  Well, a pickup truck had crashed into the house right behind me. 
[00:35:00]  What did the house?  You knew it wouldn't be an escalator.  But it had stopped a steel beam from falling down on top of me.  I was under the steel beam, but it didn't hit me.  So that kept it from crushing me.  Ah.  And my bread baker, of all things, kept the wall up enough where I could have some airspace to breathe.  Bread baker?  You were right. 
[00:35:30]  She thinks she's better than us.  Got herself bread baker.  Bread baker.  Come on, kids.  I was sitting there and a Chevy Vega came through the window, had them mag wheels on the back.  And then my Atari, well, that became a whipper snapper.  And that thing got going.  Bread baker.  Bread baker.  Come on, children.  Gonna be a tornado.  Gather around the bread baker.  It's gonna save her lives. 
[00:36:00]  Them checkers from Connect Four just are flying around.  Lift me up.  Three dirt streets over.  I landed.  What an awful way of life.  You know when you get way out there in the middle of nowhere and it's just named after like a letter?  Like Public Street H?  Yeah.  They just didn't even, it's not even worth a name.  No one wanted to be named after anything.  Just numbers and letters.  Still fighting for electricity. 
[00:36:30]  You got that dude with his spool backing up the streets.  Go and get our sewer system in next month.  Anyway.  And no more communal shit.  Yeah, well, good thing we don't have those to worry about, right?  Just terrorists and...  When we get back from the break, we have a man who's suing after getting glued to a toilet.  Very injured.  And the man is Jay Clark, who's one of the bigwigs at the Little Doggy Company, it looks like. 
[00:37:00]  That's what he looks like.  There he is, Jay Clark.  He was glued to a toilet seat.  Why would you show your face on TV?  I was gonna say, you know he grew the beard for this interview after he gets his money, he's shaving it.  Why would you, yeah, go on the news.  Just sue.  Leave it at that.  And what happened?  I don't even know the story.  Did somebody put glue on his seat as a gag and he sat down?  We'll have the story after the break.  I think they were cleaning the toilet with some glue. 
[00:37:30]  Cleaning it with some glue.  There's all the wise asses in the warehouse of the Walmart or something that that shit happened in the sand.  Where was it?  What's going on, Beth?  I just shot him some pictures.  Ah, Pat's done.  There's pictures of those pirates.  Someone just sent in pictures of the pirates that got the cruise ship.  Yeah, that was in the paper.  They're pirates, are they?  I was just gonna, we were gonna print them out.  They don't dress like pirates.  No, they dress like homeboys.  Yeah, they're like homies.  What happened?  In boats.  The pirates attacked the cruise ship off of Africa. 
[00:38:00]  Off of Somalia.  Off of Somalia.  That's the first mistake.  Why would you take a cruise ship anywhere near Somalia?  Not known as our friendliest little neighbor.  Yeah, and that's not rubbing it in their faces.  Yeah.  Seeing this luxurious cruise ship offshore.  Waving, waving.  You think they toot the horn.  You can hear, feeling hot, hot, hot.  It was in the middle of the night.  Just starving. 
[00:38:30]  We're throwing shrimp overboard because it's just too full.  Yeah, the all-you-can-eat buffet is getting to us.  Just eating prime rib on the deck like a rabid dog as he was starving.  You're eating and puking over the side before you go in and get more.  Because you can't.  Oh, that's the perfect song, too.  Ole, ole, ole.  Hey, look, there's people on the coast.  Let's just wave to them.  There's stick figures on the coast. 
[00:39:00]  What are they doing?  How many of...  I don't know how many RPGs were made.  Like, how many of those old-style...  Everyone seems to have them.  These pirates had them.  They fired a few into a few staterooms of the ship, a couple of which is still unexploded as they're heading back to a port for repairs.  But, yeah, these two boats, full of pirates, they're calling them, Somalis with RPGs and machine guns, started up on this cruise ship and opened fire on it. 
[00:39:30]  And they did what?  They just stopped?  Why didn't they fucking ram it?  They did.  The cruise ship turned around and tried to ram the boats, the little boats.  They got out of the way and tried to sink them with the wake from the big cruise ships.  And finally, I wound up outrunning the pirates.  Is this Speed Part 2?  Are you sure you weren't watching the ending of it?  And then they hit, like, a town.  Was Willem Dafoe on that boat? 
[00:40:00]  There it is.  Hey!  Woo!  Look at us!  Everyone's doing a conga line around the deck.  And there's just this dying child with a fly around his head.  Looking on with this mother just...  Smacking some chick's ass with a roast beef sandwich in the other hand.  Woo!  You want the rest of this before I throw it overboard?  I'm not gonna eat it!  Fuck it!  Yeah!  Dude!  Chocolate buffet tonight!  It's chocolate buffet! 
[00:40:30]  It's as long as the fucking deck.  And it's all Godiva chocolate.  Chocolate cake.  Yeah!  Hey, people!  I'm going to the casino!  I'll see you at the casino, people!  It's hot, hot, hot!  Feeling hot, hot.  As they're on a 110 degree, like, beach, looking...  Looking at the cruise ship go by. 
[00:41:00]  Looking at luxury.  Look at Jerry!  Fucking crazy!  Go ahead, Jerry!  Do a cannonball!  Of course the pirates had an attack.  Of course.  So they go by fucking Rwanda.  People getting hacked up by machetes.  That's another great story that's happening.  Piracy.  It seems it's commonplace over there.  And a lot of the crews now are trained in this, and they were. 
[00:41:30]  They were trained.  They got all the passengers to the middle of the ship in one of the restaurants.  So they weren't just, you know, Murray, what's happening outside?  Get on the balcony, I hear some noises.  They got them all in the middle of the ship.  And just the captain knows the maneuvers to do to get away from these guys.  And tried to ram them.  Tried to get the wake to flip them over.  And finally just outran it.  Is it just an annoyance on the cruise ship?  Like a bug?  An annoyance back there?  On a cruise ship? 
[00:42:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  An annoyance on a cruise ship should be the roast beef is a little overcooked.  Here are the pictures, by the way.  That's the most annoyance I want.  Dude, you know how freaked out?  I fucking hate the ocean.  I can't imagine being on this.  Bill, look at that.  Cruises are great, man.  Look, look.  Look at the pictures.  Let me see the close-up.  Oh, that's nice.  A little skiff.  Where's that one?  There you go.  Look at them with the RPGs, the machine guns.  Off the coast of Africa.  Can you imagine those white people?  Oh, my God, they're going to eat us. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, my God.  We're going to be in big steel pods.  The one...  Look at them with the little AK-47.  Is the guy in the back laughing?  Yeah, I was going to say that.  The one pirate is laughing as the other guy aims.  Ah, motherfucker.  They're just having...  They're just having fun.  Ay, me mateys.  This is just a day out for the boys.  Ooh, you varmint.  There you have it.  Do you, idiot?  Do you, idiot, galoot?  Now I've got to go back to the ship for another RPG. 
[00:43:00]  One at a time, the shark bites his foot.  That is...  That's the new face of pirates.  Yeah.  Where's this shirt like our own E-Rock was wearing the other day with the stripes?  Why are they wearing Nike wear?  Arr, motherfucker.  All right.  There you go.  Pirates attacking cruise ships off of Somalia.  That doesn't happen on the Caribbean cruises.  How many fucking minutes before did they come up with that plan? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, that seems a little spontaneous.  They were bored.  It looks like they were fishing at first and then just somebody set in.  Fishing with guns and RPGs and shit.  You want to do it?  Well, look at that little ass boat.  Yeah.  And you would think you would have a boat that could outrun the cruise ship.  You know, if you're going to hijack a boat, have a faster boat so you can catch it.  But, yeah, the crews are all trained for this now when they're cruising around Somalia for some reason.  Wow.  That gap between the rich and the poor is just getting wider and wider, isn't it? 
[00:44:00]  It is.  I love it.  I love it.  When I've been to the Caribbean, though, not one pirate.  Not one pirate.  The only pirate I ever see is the wonderful Captain Morgan.  Arr, matey.  Make me another with Coke.  I saw Captain Marvin when I was down in the Grand Cayman Islands.  Is this from, who is this?  Biv from Wack Bag.  Arr, me primates. 
[00:44:30]  That is an awful racist joke, and I must give you the bell, no matter how creative it was.  All right.  I don't think the pirates are in the Caribbean, really.  Nah, that's old school pirates.  Nah, they got that all figured out down there.  With the big blowing sails.  Yeah, nah.  You just, like, give it a quarter throttle and you're out running them.  Arr, step it up!  It's off these other islands that you've got to worry.  Yeah, off Africa.  If you're cruising off...  I don't know.  Like, my parents have suggested doing European cruises, like the Mediterranean and shit like 
[00:45:00]  that.  I won't go.  I like going down to the Caribbean.  They're all nice.  They try to sell you stuff.  That's about the biggest inconvenience.  There's no Muslims.  No Muslims down there.  With a boat full of dynamite.  That's right.  Trying to put a big hole in your boat.  Mm-mm.  Going on another one in April, by the way.  That's right.  Not an even bigger ship.  You want to go to an a la free zone.  Right.  No a la.  No a la.  No Muslims. 
[00:45:30]  All right.  That's it.  Why don't we take our first break?  Regroup here.  Arr.  When we get back, we'll have the toilet story, I guess.  The guy that's suing.  He's suing because he was glued to a toilet seat.  We'll see what that's all about.  Also, another assault on the media.  Why be the white women?  That caused all sorts of controversy on whackbag.com over the weekend.  We'll get into that a little bit.  Mm-hmm.  Some people are saying we shouldn't have assaulted this particular story.  Ah, yes.  Shut up.  More controversial.  Shut up.  I bet.  And we got Bill Burr in studio today. 
[00:46:00]  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  Most radio, and I've worked for all of them, so, you know, but I always thought it was such a stupid thing.  The home of rock and roll.  And all the other rock stations in your area, they're not the home of rock and roll.  No.  We're the home of rock and roll.  Ah!  Oh, no.  Right on my fucking foot!  That fucking thing fell again right on my fucking foot!  I can't tell you how many times last week I asked for this to be fixed, and it just fell on my fucking bad foot. 
[00:46:30]  I have a foot thing on my foot, and it just fell on it.  Don't laugh.  I'm trying to get the foot thing on his foot.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  He's got one of those.  Why did that fall again?  Why did that fall again on my bad foot?  It's got one of those bad foot.  Dude, I got a foot on my foot because I have tendonitis, I have arthritis, and I have ligament damage. 
[00:47:00]  He's got an old man's foot.  And it's right on my goddamn foot.  That's the third time that fucking thing has fucking fallen.  Third time.  Holy shit, is that aggravating.  Anthony and Jimmy are very serious if me and Bob get out of my foot.  It does not have fallen again. 
[00:47:30]  Right on my foot.  Holy shit.  I saw his face.  He just hurt that freaking whack.  Scared the shit out of everybody.  It didn't scare me, man.  Don't look like a stress doll.  Somebody squeezed his gut.  And then he just, I got a foot thing.  I got an arm thing on my fucking foot.  Look at his foot.  I got an arm thing on my foot.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing.  It has to work. 
[00:48:00]  Big foot thing.  I have enough problems.  He's going snowboarding after the show.  I'm trying to avoid surgery.  Yeah.  And I have stage four damage.  I have stage three damage.  I'm one inch from surgery.  Now you get stage four.  And I want to bite somebody's fucking face for that.  How did that happen?  I want to know who fixed that.  Are you on the AZT for the stage?  Why did it not happen?  Why was that not fixed?  No one fixed it.  It wasn't fixed.  Holy shit.  Is that irritating?  It was fixed.  It wouldn't have fallen.  How big was the thing that fell, though?  It's this big.  It's a piece of it.  What is it? 
[00:48:30]  It's solid.  And it falls.  It's like, it's probably eight inches off the ground.  Opie probably has fishing string over there.  All right.  Right now again.  Quack.  My fucking foot.  I got a foot of a foot on my foot.  Left-ass fucking foot.  Kirby and Anthony.  The virus is spreading. 
[00:49:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Bill Burr in studio helping us out once again today.  Absolutely.  All right.  We got lots to do.  There was another assault on the media.  Yes, there was.  A bunch of asses saying that we're spending too much time on the assault on the media contest. 
[00:49:30]  We spend maybe five minutes a day.  Five minutes a day.  You know what?  Out of four hours of programming, let's all calm down and relax.  It's a biggie for the show.  It's helping out the program a lot.  There was a guy that wrote a list on the message board.  A ten-point list of what we should be doing on this program, Opie.  Is it worth reading?  No.  Oh, okay.  It just stinks.  One of it was we should only concentrate on assaults on the media one or two times a month. 
[00:50:00]  Now, we concentrate on them when they happen.  It's something that happens spontaneously.  We could get three, four in a week.  And then we could go two weeks without any assaults on the media.  You can't have an assault on the media and then, all right, well, we can only do this once or twice a month.  Let's save that for, you know, two weeks down the road.  Not quite topical.  That point alone was ridiculous.  And then later on, O&A have to start doing the things that got them the attention that they used to get. 
[00:50:30]  Well, how many stories have been done on the paper about the assaults on the media, you jackass?  That point negated the first point about...  I absolutely hate critics.  If this guy knows how to do a radio show, then start doing your own, you fucking asshole.  Then do it yourself.  Then do it yourself.  Get a show.  Do it yourself.  I love these armchair quarterbacks.  Become more successful than us. 
[00:51:00]  And then we'll say, you know something?  Wow, you were right.  You were right.  We'll save your post.  But until that day comes, we'll save all your posts.  If it takes ten years, I'll save them in my back pocket.  And then when you're more successful than Anthony and I have been, then we'll give you your props.  I might even give him...  In the meantime, shut up.  ...a ridiculous bow.  Like I gave at Jimmy's stand-up.  No, the assault on the media thing is huge for us.  It's free advertising for the show.  Plus, we're making the media look absolutely ridiculous and stupid. 
[00:51:30]  And we get in the paper because of it.  And we can't get enough of it.  We think it's a great thing for this program.  And the assault on the media thing is very hot right now.  It's extremely hot.  I think it's peaking.  It's going to be peaking for the next few months.  And then I think it's going to slowly go away.  That's hot.  It's hot, though.  It's very, very hot.  I can't stand her catchphrase.  That's hot.  That's hot.  Paris Hilton's little catchphrase.  I can't be bothered with Paris Hilton.  That's hot.  She went all out for Halloween, though.  Her nice costume.  What's she dressed up? 
[00:52:00]  She dressed like a whore.  Can you believe it?  A whore?  I think she just wore her regular whore clothes, and then she put little fuzzy ears on top.  I'm a fox.  I'm a fox with a thong.  I think it's hot.  Isn't it hot?  It's hot.  My wife's name is Paris Hilton.  Now we don't get confused.  Not anymore.  You've got to be up on this.  Oh, really?  And I just said I don't care about Paris Hilton.  But you know she's not going out with that guy named Paris.  No, she's with a new billionaire.  Yeah.  Yeah, she blew off the Paris guy. 
[00:52:30]  Aw, shame.  All right, so why don't we get into this a little bit.  The Assault in the Media contest is going great for the month of November.  No filter, Paul's in the lead.  Of course, if you were listening last week to the program.  Here's the other thing, by the way.  Some of these people listen too much.  I hate to say that, but they do.  Yeah.  Like, I had a little family function over the weekend, and I have a brother and a brother-in-law  especially that are just freaks about this show.  They listen to this show religiously, right?  And I asked them if they heard the latest, you know, Assault in the Media from No Filter  Paul, which we talked about a lot last week. 
[00:53:00]  Didn't hear it.  No.  Didn't hear it, because they can't listen four hours a day.  They try.  There are people that listen to this show that we're doing, you know, as we do it, and they  listen to the replay, and hear it twice.  Right.  Twice a day.  I mean...  We've been at this a long time.  Here's a little taste of reality for the real hardcore listeners, and we appreciate you  guys.  Of course we do.  You know, you guys make a lot happen for this program.  But the reality is the average listener to this program probably listens about a half 
[00:53:30]  hour a day.  Yeah, you're not the norm.  You're not the person that we have to base how we do this program on.  And a half hour a day is probably pushing it.  Probably pushing it.  Okay.  Is it unfair, because you're there for us during the live show for four hours, and the  replay for four hours, and you're such a dedicated fan, is it fair that you're not the person  that we, as a show, should cater to?  You're right.  That isn't fair.  But it's just the way it is, and you've got to deal with it. 
[00:54:00]  I just laugh when you read stuff, they're spending too much time on the Assault in the  Media thing, when the reality is we probably should spend more time on it.  We really should.  Four hours, Elsie.  You know, I'm just laughing, because I thought I was the only one who reads, like, emails  and shit, and I just obsess and flip out about it.  We're insane.  Well, now we just fight back.  You know, it used to get to us.  Now it's just like, now we'd like to show how ridiculous half this shit is.  I posted last night on a thread.  It was your favorite bits from O&A. 
[00:54:30]  What have they been?  And I had to post, because I swear to you, that topic comes up every week.  Every week, that topic is there.  Dude, what's your favorite bit?  Dude, favorite bit from O&A?  Dude, what's the favorite bit?  Best bit ever.  What's the...  See, it's not easy.  See, it's not easy.  And that's what I posted.  I posted, geez, you guys, can't you come up with something new?  It's the same shit.  You guys are just rehashing.  You posted.  I like the board the way it used to be. 
[00:55:00]  The reality is, there's only a handful of shows that can pull off what we're doing on  a daily basis.  Right.  That's the reality of it.  We're great.  Shut up.  It's so hard to come up with four hours of brand new stuff every single day.  It's almost impossible.  So you find these little things that you can write out a little bit.  And one of them is the Assault on the Media contest.  It's our job to try to keep it as interesting as possible.  And until I stop laughing when I see them on TV, we're going to do them.  Oh, I'm not bored of them at all. 
[00:55:30]  They are hysterical.  Now we've got an Assault on the Media section on opianathlete.com where you just click the  link and they're all there.  Yeah.  I spend at least an hour, maybe an hour and a half over the weekend just randomly looking  at them.  Is that my post?  Yeah.  Oh, what does it say?  Oh, here it is.  My God, how many times has this topic been done?  It seems like every week.  I like the way the board was before.  It's like you guys aren't even trying anymore.  Same topics over and over and over again.  You're phoning it in. 
[00:56:00]  That's what these idiots say to us, Bill.  That we're not trying anymore.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  This show is so much better than the commercial radio show we did.  Then you should have written something like racist.  Yeah.  That's like another thing that I find.  Like on one of those things I had, like I asked myself some questions.  Like every question.  Yeah, there's got to be some kind of racist.  Look at that coon, Charlie Murphy, like you're being like edgy.  Yeah.  What the fuck, guys?  Yeah.  It's just like, why don't you go say that to his face?  Why don't you ask him that question?  Yeah.  Those tough internet racists. 
[00:56:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Go read your post up in Harlem and then I'll answer it.  You know, there used to be somewhat of a gamble to be a racist.  Because you couldn't just be a racist sitting in your living room.  You know, it had no impact.  You either had to be a racist out in public, which then opened yourself up to an ass beating  if the wrong person heard it.  Or to get your point across, you would have to print up flyers, go to cars, telephone polls, 
[00:57:00]  and hang up your racist things.  Now, complete anonymity.  Right.  You just sit there, type away, and hit sense.  Right.  Pussy racist.  Yeah.  There wasn't time.  There was a risk.  There was some risk.  You're walking down Main Street in your town with your flyers and your big stapler.  Yeah.  Whistling a tune.  It doesn't matter.  Four in the morning.  No one's around.  You're stapling.  You might get a guy that's going to come down and go, this motherfuckers.  What do we got here? 
[00:57:30]  Now it's just, click, send, fucking A, dude.  Look how brave I am.  No need for a two by four anymore.  No.  Dude, like every other one of them.  And then even on MySpace, people, they'll send you like pictures, and it's just some just  horrifically racist fucking picture of some black dude.  Dude, how come you won't accept me as your friend?  Because you're a moron.  That's why.  Because you're a fucking moron.  And there's just something so fucking, it's just so pussy about that. 
[00:58:00]  You know what I mean?  It's like, say it to the person's face.  Don't fucking have this little snickering in the background.  There is definitely a line between racial humor and racial stereotype humor and just  coming off like, oh my God, that is not a healthy attitude.  It's blunt force trauma, racism.  There's just no subtlety.  Yeah.  Yeah, like you could be talking about anything on the message board, too, you know? 
[00:58:30]  And it'll just pop up.  Yeah, do they not see the line?  Yeah, they'll be like, yeah, black people, you know, why are you guys always talking so  much in movies there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Niggers.  Right?  It's the same thing.  We're all on the same page.  That's right.  I didn't leap just fucking 80 yards down the fucking road.  They literally think it's like the same thing.  You're like, no, dude, it really isn't.  See, the first thing was kind of funny.  Yeah.  People were kind of all laughing, and then you went there, and maybe there was a bit of 
[00:59:00]  an ironic twist to it, some kind of stereotypical humor to it.  But some sort of hint that there was a little twinkle in your eye as you were doing it as  opposed to just straight up white rage.  I watched this thing on the Klan the other night on, what the hell was it?  I don't know, one of those 80 million channels out there.  Was it one of the educational channels?  Yeah, they're starting, they're trying to tone it down.  Oh, yeah.  They're trying to tone it down to try to be more like mainstream. 
[00:59:30]  Or PC.  So a lot of people are defecting from the Klan, and like one person was just like, you  know, I don't understand, you know, if there's no hatred, I mean, what's the point of being  a member of this?  What's the point?  My thing is, how fucked up are you when you got to walk away from the Klan like, these  guys are a bunch of fags, man.  The new Klan.  And that's all you need, too, is a great webpage with a nice logo, the KKK, and a nice font.  Oh, and it's all these just horrifically poor white people, and they're hating black people. 
[01:00:00]  It's like, dude, they're not the ones.  They're the ones running the Fortune 500 companies that are fucking putting the Walmart  in and taking away your fucking, they're not.  My local store.  Sons of bitches.  Yeah.  They're taking over.  All right.  There's 200 million of us and 37 million of them.  It is truly just a bevy of everything on the internet.  Yeah, to bring it back around, so the assault on the media thing.  Mm-hmm.  By the way, we added some great prizes for this month's contest. 
[01:00:30]  We got the basics.  We got the MiFi with the year free subscription.  We got the dinner with E-Rock at Paisano's of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  And, of course, admission to check out one of our shows, right?  Mm-hmm.  Now, Jagermeister has come to the table, and they're giving out, like, guitars valued at  $900 each, Jagermeister amps, $300 each, Jagermeister music tour disturbed coffin case guitar cases  valued at $300 each, and then a pair of tickets and VIP passes to be in the Jagermeister VIP area 
[01:01:00]  and meet the bands.  Man.  That's the Disturbed tour, right?  Nice.  I don't know what other bands are playing on that, but we know our pals Disturbed are involved in that.  So, Paul, No Filter Paul, did another assault on the media last night or two nights ago.  And there's a lot of controversy because the story was over...  What was the story about, big-ass member?  The story was about a kid who was run over outside a park by a guy fleeing police in a police chase. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, it was a cop chasing some car through a residential neighborhood, which is what all the hubbub's about,  and hit a kid.  I don't know if I'd call it residential down there.  It's more like the ghetto.  I don't know.  They said residential neighborhood, like there was a school nearby and whatever.  It's more tragic, but it's a news story, and they were doing a live feed from that. 
[01:02:00]  And No Filter Paul.  This makes it even better when it's like a serious story.  I know.  Yeah, because what are they accomplishing by reporting this story?  That's what I want to know.  From the scene.  That's why I have no problem with the fact that these guys chose this particular report to do an assault on the media.  What is the media accomplishing in that situation?  Someone please explain that to me.  And if you've got a serious thing here, call up.  I want to know what they're accomplishing. 
[01:02:30]  They're getting some kind of sensationalism, because behind this guy was police tape, some lights, some cop lights,  things like that that make the scene more dramatic.  It doesn't help inform the people.  It makes it look better.  It's a more dramatic thing to go to the actual place, so that sitting at home in your living room,  you still have the ability to gawk, to sit there as if you were there, 
[01:03:00]  like one of those jerk-offs that have to gather around the accident site and sit there and gawk.  That's what the news is giving you the opportunity to do.  It's not helping the story.  They could have reported it from the studio, and that's why we could give a shit what the story is.  It's a sad story, but I don't need that sadness when I'm eating my dinner.  When I'm on my cruise ship.  Well, whatever.  I mean, hot, hot, hot.  But a bunch of dopes on the message board are like, oh, man, isn't there a line? 
[01:03:30]  Wrong story, man.  Isn't there a line?  Wrong story, guys.  Come on.  What's wrong with you?  So, please, if you're going to do an assault, tap the anchor on the shoulder before the cameras go on and say, what's the story about?  Yeah, what's the story about?  Because we're not really sure.  There is no line, because the media is not doing anything important.  Don't you guys get that yet?  Yeah.  If this was a story about a missing kid, and they're live, and we only have hours to find this missing kid,  because the person that took the kid is going to chop him into little pieces, 
[01:04:00]  and they have some pertinent information, and they had to jump on TV and give that pertinent information,  then I can see where the media is actually helping the situation.  Yeah, that would still be funny.  Yeah, it would still be funny that all of a sudden there's an ONA sign in the background.  But in this case...  It's really a dark hour for the parents.  In this case, though...  Party rock!  In this case, there's nothing.  They're not accomplishing anything whatsoever.  They're getting higher ratings by it.  So we got big-ass member.  You were one of the guys?  Yes, myself and no-filter Paul.  We were actually out seeing Voss at Bananas in Hasbrook Heights with Sig A. 
[01:04:30]  And Big A pussied out from going down to the ghetto in East Orange.  Yeah, these guys decided to jump in their ride and go to the ghetto.  East Orange is a very scary place.  Paul's $40,000 sports car, mind you.  So is working Bananas.  No-filter Paul!  Good morning, guys.  So walk us through this.  Yeah, Big A is his fault.  If anyone wants to blame anyone, he was the one who called us and told us about it. 
[01:05:00]  Who would call us?  Yeah.  Hey, Paul, don't back out.  No, no, I'm not backing out at all because the bottom line is these guys were reporting  this at 11 p.m. and knocking on doors at 11 p.m.  This thing happened at 2 o'clock.  Channel 2 and Channel 7 were down there and they were still trying to interview people  banging on doors.  What the fuck is wrong with these people?  I see nothing wrong with this.  They didn't accomplish anything by throwing this story on TV.  And they're trying to make more controversy.  They're the ones now going to the residents and asking them about police chases. 
[01:05:30]  Should they be stopped in light of this tragedy?  And, of course, they're getting all the people that are like, yeah, they should call off police  chases through residential neighborhoods.  Right, right, right, right.  So they're kind of skewing public opinion by just getting these people on the air.  They try to make and mold the news to what they think is going to be the most sensational  thing.  The only good thing that the news did get out there is the fact that when this car went 
[01:06:00]  over this kid and they dragged the guy that was driving it out of the car, he actually  told the cops that there was someone under his car and the cops told him to shut up and  put him in the back of the car and the child was under there for like three hours before  they got the car up.  Three hours?  Yeah.  Three hours.  I saw that.  I'm like, yeah.  So anyway, yeah.  So that should be the controversy of this, not what we're doing.  So, yeah, you got a lot of shit on the message board over the weekend, huh?  Nah, it turned around pretty quickly.  It was like 80%, you know, 4%, 20%. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, you shouldn't be doing this.  This is serious.  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever.  Fuck off.  Yeah, exactly.  The only controversy was what the fuck two white boys were doing in some place that's  darker than Philly at 11 p.m.  That's the only controversy that should have been.  All right.  Well, this assault on the media, not as good as the other one by now.  Not at all.  In actual fact, when we were driving there and we were discussing what we were going to do,  we pretty much figured it wouldn't be because we really didn't plan anything.  We decided we weren't going to do anything stupid other than jump up and down like assholes.  Yeah, I forgot my trumpet back there.  That would have gone over well. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, but there's a lot of things we accomplished with these assaults on the media.  Sometimes they're just fun to watch, and other times we just get the message out.  Yeah.  This was one of those just getting the message out.  And we had decided that, you know, if the family members were out there, we definitely  weren't going to do anything.  Paul, don't worry about us.  I don't know.  We were severely outnumbered down there.  And when we arrived at the place, there was Channel 2 and Channel 7 trucks there, and  straight away they spotted us, and they knew.  Because the Channel 7 guy was the same guy that, remember that mystery pest that stuck 
[01:07:30]  his head in the side of the screen last month?  Yeah, one of my favorites, where the guy just peeked around, peeked into the shot, and  then the black reporter had to push his face out of the shot.  Right, as he's going, hey, you listen to Opie and Anthony on XM Sally right here?  Hey, are you open?  And he just turns and pushes the pest face out of the shot.  Starts a conversation with the news guy.  He's doing this live.  Oh, yeah.  He looked in like he was going to come out of the screen.  Yeah.  Hey.  Right, right.  So when we got down there, we, like, walked past them and, like, stood on the opposite 
[01:08:00]  corner.  But as I said, we stood out really badly, and they looked at us a few times.  And if you look, right when he went live, you see him look to his right, at which point  we're already trying to run across the street towards him.  Yeah.  And he's like, ah, fuck.  And as soon as we got behind him, he's like, okay, let's go to the report.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's listen to the audio really fast here.  This is now from East Orange, New Jersey, where the accident took place, Jeff.  And Charles, he was so close to home.  Just a few more paces, and he would have made it.  But just four days shy of his 14th birthday, this teenager was killed. 
[01:08:30]  Let's go to the story.  That was negligence.  I don't care how anyone else see it.  That guy didn't get thrown at all.  He never gets thrown.  He didn't get thrown.  He was the guy, like I said, he was the same guy that pushed a pest face out of the shot  casually and continued doing his story.  He didn't even turn his head a little bit.  They went behind him yelling and screaming.  And even when he was done talking, that slight pause between him stopping and going to the  tape, he just focused forward on the camera. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, and that's Channel 7 once again.  Channel 7's getting hit so many times by this assault on the media contest.  He definitely did shorten his report, though.  Because he was looking at his notepad, and he was like, I don't think I'm going to bother reading this.  Let's just skip to the video.  Right.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  We've got to get more dramatic lines.  Let's say hi to Tim.  Hey, Tim, what's going on?  Not much, guys.  What's going on?  All right.  I've got to tell you that I was watching the news, and I live in Maywood, which is pretty  close to East Orange.  I do a lot of work in East Orange. 
[01:09:30]  And when they first came through, I was like, oh, man, this is the wrong time.  But then it occurred to me, what the fuck are these two white guys doing at East Orange  at 11 o'clock at night?  Yeah.  I do a lot of work in here.  I don't want to go in there on a Sunday morning at 6 o'clock when it's pouring rain out.  I'm scared for my life.  Right.  These two guys walk in the middle of civil unrest.  All these people are pissed at the cops and everything.  And they're taking advantage of it.  I thought it was hilarious.  Wow.  They're big fans of the Opie and Anthony program.  I thought it was hilarious.  All right, guys.  See you. 
[01:10:00]  All right, Tim.  No outrage at the guys that were driving the actual car?  Is there outrage at the guys that were driving the car that ran the kid over that were in  a stolen vehicle?  Can we get a little outrage on those guys?  It's always the cops' fault.  It's always the cops' fault.  Yeah, that is ridiculous.  Yeah.  What about the guy who actually ran the kid over?  And then the confusion is that running up going, okay, we're going to get shot.  They got weapons, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  They're not listening to them. 
[01:10:30]  There's 80 people all yelling at once.  Yeah.  Excuse me, officer.  Yeah.  I've seen those scenes.  They are nasty.  When you're trying to, you know, cops are out there and they're trying to arrest a couple  of guys and the whole town now starts coming out like, you know, zombies that are coming  out of their houses and you got to try to keep them back.  And they're going to, I need some backup.  Let's get.  Yeah, yeah.  We are backup.  Back up here.  We need some backup.  Hey, two guys sitting there.  Keep back.  Stay back. 
[01:11:00]  Whoa, my son.  Whoa.  Oh, man.  This is going to get ugly.  It's basically 50 people yelling, shut the fuck up.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Back the fuck up.  And God forbid one of the guys that they're arresting starts resisting a little and you  got to tune him up a little to get the cuffs on the back.  Why are you hitting him?  You know what I always wanted to ask?  I always wanted to ask like either somebody like a bouncer, some security at a game or  a cop.  Why?  When like, you ever see a dude, he just, he gives up. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  I give up.  You're on the ground.  They'll even lay down, spread eagle.  They still got to come in with that flying fucking drop kick to the back of your head.  Like, what do they train you in the school?  Like, like what happened?  Like, dude, there was a guy, man.  He was spread on the ground.  We, we kind of moseyed on up.  He fucking turned his foot, broke his ankle.  I mean, what happened?  He laid completely prone.  We walked up, went to cuff him.  The guy had a knife.  I don't know how quick he grabbed it. 
[01:12:00]  He did.  That's probably what it is.  I saw a kid in the club one night, right?  He started a fight with a guy and then it starts to stop and these 12 bouncers are coming  at him.  And all he said, he said, all right, like 50 fucking times.  He's just like, all right, all right, all right, all right.  They just, they just, they just picked this guy up by his neck, like four of the biggest  guys you ever saw and just started running towards the exit.  And there's like people dancing, just clearing a path.  And he just, all right, all right, all right.  Once you're in battle mode, it's just over.  You've seen these guys get into these car chases where, yeah, they're, the guy's trying 
[01:12:30]  to run the cop off the road.  He's throwing shit out the window, uh, whatever.  And they finally get him.  He gets out of the car and I've seen the one on cops is hysterical where the guy gets out,  puts his hands up and smiles like, all right, you got me.  They, three guys just bam, right to the ground.  Oh yeah.  The one cop, the knee on the neck.  My favorite, the hair pull where the cop grabs the guy by the hair and the side of the guy's 
[01:13:00]  face gets pushed into the ground a few times.  Like a cheese grater.  Yeah.  Just, ah, and they're rubbing it on, on, on the ground.  And then they just grab, it looks like they're breaking both arms to cuff him.  I love that shit.  That's probably because their superior officer's yelling at him when they're in the car.  It's on the fucking news.  Yeah.  Well, you get this guy, get this mother after him.  I love that though, because why should the perp be able to just decide, all right, it's  over.  I give now, treat me nicely.  No, but they're pissed. 
[01:13:30]  But that's someone's baby.  Yeah.  That was someone's, uh, bundle of joy.  Sorry.  Fast forward 19 years.  When you, uh.  I think the adrenaline gets the best of you in that situation.  That's, that's something they've talked about.  Like all of a sudden, you can't turn it off.  You got the adrenaline flowing through your, your veins there.  And all of a sudden, uh, you know, the guy puts his hands up, but you're not, like you  said, you're.  I talked to this cop one night.  You're not ready to stop.  One night.  And he was saying like, a lot of times guys, the first time they get into a gunfight with  somebody, they pull their gun out of their hoster. 
[01:14:00]  And by the time they bring it up level, they're out of bullets.  Oh.  Like you're a drink.  You say.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  You're shooting the asshole.  And then you click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  You just tell.  I mean, someone's shooting at you.  I was asking him.  I'm like, how the hell did they shoot that guy, you know, 40 something fucking times?  It's like, dude, you have no idea what that's like when someone's shooting at you.  He's thinking, you're just like, fuck.  No, you're not going to shoot one and then assess the situation after every shot.  Is he, does he look hit?  Is he still a threat?  Is he, how many bullets are in my gun? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to shoot him until I hear the clicking noise.  Yeah, let someone else count him up later.  I'm not worried about counting right now.  Sonny Farrelli.  What's up, Sonny?  Hey, guys.  What's happening, man?  Sonny Farrelli is another guy that just does a lot of assaults on the media.  I'll tell you, personally, morally, I try to stay away from the stories that involve death and stuff like that.  But that's just a personal opinion.  And as far as the attack on the media goes in general, I think it's all game.  Of course it's all game. 
[01:15:00]  Yep.  These guys are not accomplishing anything.  Yep.  I mean, let's face it, I mean, the last thing I want to do, want to have in front of my yard, if I have a loved one die tragically, is having my, having my local media sitting in front of my door at all hours of the night.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, sir.  Thanks, Sonny.  Hey.  We look forward to your next assault on the media.  Yeah, definitely.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  No.  I saw it coming. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Like, hey, Anthony.  It's like, yeah.  Uh, Vinny.  Yo.  What's up, Vinny?  Hey, boys.  I just want to say no assault on the media should be left unturned, man.  Any, any live shot about anything, whether it's a missing kid or whatever it could be, it could be done from the studio.  A live shot's open game, boys.  Yeah, and we've heard in the past a reporter turn to one of these pests and go, what are you doing?  We're trying to do something here.  What are you trying to do?  Someone from the media explain what you're trying to do with these, uh, with these, uh, stories. 
[01:16:00]  It's rubbernecking from your couch.  You can do it at the studio.  You know, that's...  It's rubbernecking from your couch.  I've never heard it.  They're giving you the opportunity to do.  That's brilliant, Anthony.  I've never heard it, uh, put that way before, but you're so right.  What was the purpose of, uh, the guy doing the stand-up shot about the, uh, subway rape from the subway stairs?  Down these very stairs, and then you look and go, oh, those are the very stairs, right there, on our TV.  Just do it from the studio. 
[01:16:30]  Down these urine-soaked stairs.  Yes.  Follow me as we...  Bring the camera.  Bring the camera.  Uh, follow me as we walk down.  We're following him.  I'm frightened.  Mm.  These Geraldo remotes.  Geraldo's got some new show now, right?  Yeah, we gotta start.  And he's doing Geraldo at large, and he's just, like, the worst of the worst when it comes to shit like this.  He is the most sensationalist pig ass.  He'd be a great guy to get, too.  Someone's gotta do that thing where you film the reporter's reaction, because I guarantee that guy, at the very least, 
[01:17:00]  it'll be just an, uh, every other word's the F-word tirade.  Yeah, after he's off the network camera, but, yeah, on, on one of the, uh, Assault on the Media guys camcorder that he brings.  You'll probably just see him lose their minds.  Send that in.  This is your nice reporter being professional, motherfucker.  All right, let's go to Ollie.  Ollie!  Hey, boys.  Hey.  My wife's a teacher, a school teacher in, uh, in East Orange. 
[01:17:30]  The place is a fucking battle zone.  These cops, they don't know what the hell to do there, man.  Every Friday is fucking riot day.  They loot, they rob.  I'm going to pick up my wife there one day.  It's like 30, 40 of these kids that are fighting in the streets.  Half of them are walking down naked because they're stealing each other's clothes and shoes and shit.  And I just feel bad for these guys.  They can't fucking, they can't fucking catch a break, you know?  You know, God bless the teachers of America, but, Ollie, I gotta ask you something.  Yeah?  Your wife wants to be a teacher that bad that she's, uh, teaching in that area? 
[01:18:00]  You know what it is?  In Jersey, it's so fucking hard to get a, to get a teaching job.  See, this is what they don't tell these, uh, these kids in college when you go to be a teacher.  Yeah.  It's all, it's all well and good when you're taking the classes and you have these dreams of being, you know, a great...  A professor at Princeton.  Oh, yeah, whatever it would be.  But they don't tell you that you're going to pretty much start in the ghetto.  Yeah.  And if you're lucky, after many, many years, they'll move you up to the semi-ghetto.  Yeah.  First day of class, like, you ever see higher learning? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  It's not going to be like that.  No happy ending.  The colleges are doing a disservice.  You gotta tell these, uh, future teachers, you're sending them to the ghetto.  Yeah.  You're sending them to war, basically.  The money she makes, they give her the battle pay.  I mean, it's incredible.  Battle pay?  Oh, they give her...  I mean, she's teaching grammar school, so it's not that bad for her.  It's just frustrating when she has to deal with these parents, you know?  She gets stuck in school waiting for the parents to pick them up.  Yeah.  And it's out that they're in detention in the high school. 
[01:19:00]  So, you know...  Some of these schools, too, it's like, they can't expel you because there's nowhere else to put you so you can do anything.  I was like, what the hell was her name?  She was actually a comedian.  And she talked during the day, and she's like, oh, they're unbelievable.  I'll be standing up there, and they'll be like, Mr. So-and-so, do you suck dick?  They'll say that in class.  I'm like, they say that?  Can you imagine ever saying anything like that in detention?  Oh, my school?  No, that would be it.  That would be the end.  Yeah, you'd just be kicked out of school, basically.  They'd still be talking about that story at the school.  Right? 
[01:19:30]  About how Bill Burr said that back in whatever year.  They would still be talking about that.  Yeah, and I would be pumping gas in my hometown.  Oh, I wouldn't be the wipers in my back pocket.  Ollie, anything else?  No, boy, punch it out.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Yeah, I mean, you know, I got friends that are teachers and stuff, but they have to do  it in, like, these horrendous situations.  And they went to school, and they had these big dreams, like you said, maybe being a professor  at Princeton.  Oh, yeah.  No, instead, you're worrying if you're going to get, you know, stabbed. 
[01:20:00]  Why isn't Carzine and Forrester addressing that instead of just bashing each other?  That is such a great campaign.  I love it.  It is a great fucking campaign.  I love it.  You know, we caught on very early that it was going to be a dirty campaign between  these two.  I'm pretty proud of what we accomplished on that story.  Yeah.  You were right.  We were on this one very early.  Very early on.  It's the governor's race for New Jersey here.  And it has gotten so dirty, so nasty.  I have no idea what these two guys really stand for. 
[01:20:30]  But I can't wait to see the latest commercial.  Yeah.  But the latest commercial, that's all I want to see.  Because it was bad.  It was each one.  It started out, they were talking about each other's records as public figures or public  officials and bashing them.  One guy, but they each were talking about how the other would raise taxes.  And apparently, both of them did or didn't.  Like, nothing's clear in this campaign.  I don't know how these poor bastards in Jersey are going to vote. 
[01:21:00]  But then, it got so nasty.  The latest round, one of them, I'm not sure, it might have been Forrester who was talking  about Corazine.  I think that's the way it was.  Got an ex-wife.  Oh yeah, it's Corazine's ex-wife.  Corazine's ex-wife to do a commercial spot.  But, she said something to the effect of, he wasn't there for our family.  Alright, go ahead.  I know it a little.  Yeah.  Basically said, he let our family down. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  He let our family down.  Don't let him let Jersey down.  Or something like that.  Like, the guy hires the other guy's ex-fucking wife to badmouth him on a spot.  So then, he turns around and says, well, you fucked around on your wife.  Wait, the Corazine said that?  Yeah.  Then Corazine said, Forrester fucked around on his wife.  And then Forrester turns around and goes, you fucked around on your wife with a staffer,  got her pregnant, and she got an abortion.  This is the shit that is being traded by these guys. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, it's great.  And it is fantastic.  He cheated on me.  Don't let him cheat on you.  He's gonna cheat the state.  He raped me in the ass.  Don't let him do it to Jersey.  It just keeps getting worse.  John Corazine wants to rape you in the ass like he did his ex-wife.  And they're saying the election is too close to call, so who knows what they're gonna pull  out of their pockets, their back pockets, in the next day.  It's so heated.  There was a debate the other day, and they kind of went at each other on their record, 
[01:22:30]  and all it was was them bashing each other's spots, saying, Well, you said that I've increased  taxes, voted to increase taxes 150 times, and that is just not true.  That is absolutely not true.  And then the other guy would go, Well, you said that I raised taxes 300%.  That is absolutely not true.  Even the paper that endorses you, sir, said that that was a lie.  How is a voter, based on the information that the goddamn candidates themselves are putting 
[01:23:00]  out, supposed to make an informed decision on who is best to run the state, when all you're  getting is the other guy calling the other guy a liar, and a whore, and his family can't  understand him.  And then the other guy's like, Who are you lying to when you're a whore?  Yeah.  And an abortion was thrown in there.  I didn't know the abortion thing.  Oh, the abortion thing.  Oh, the abortion story.  That's an actual commercial running?  Yeah.  It's accusations. 
[01:23:30]  Dude, they are calling this the dirtiest campaign ever.  And they're all going to go this way now.  They're all going to go this way.  Oh, yeah.  Nobody's taking the higher road in this one.  Well, I think Corzine tries to, with election day, hours away, he's decided to kind of try  to take the high road and just talk about the issues and what he does.  That means he's got nothing left.  Nah. 
[01:24:00]  Nothing in the tank.  Can we prove he touched that kid?  Nathaniel handed me something here.  There's a boy in the mix we can throw in here.  What do we got, buddy?  The first one is one of the rare positive ads in this campaign for Corzine.  These are ones that are just starting to come out now.  Yeah.  Do we need to hear it, though?  Who cares?  Let's hear what his platform is.  Before you vote, I want you to know where I stand.  I believe in the promise of stem cell research, strong gun laws, and a woman's right to choose. 
[01:24:30]  I believe health care and education are top priorities.  I believe we need smarter investment of state dollars, not higher taxes.  I believe in cutting property taxes for senior citizens in the middle class.  I believe in honest government.  Most of all, I believe it's time to lead New Jersey in a new direction.  Corzine for government.  It's so sad that they've got to promote honest government.  Honesty.  And when they say top priority, that means nothing. 
[01:25:00]  That means, hey, it's a top priority, but the reality is I'll never get to that.  Now, based on that ad, you'd go like, wow, that guy really seems to care about Jersey.  Yeah.  I don't want higher taxes.  Yeah.  I want priorities on, you know, education and things like that.  But then the other commercial will come on with Forrester and it'll be going, he's a liar.  He's a lying sack of shit.  Everything he says is a lie.  Same happy music in the background.  Yeah.  What's the second one, Nathaniel? 
[01:25:30]  Now it's back to the negative Forrester, anti-Forrester stuff about how he flip-flopped.  What does Doug Forrester really believe?  Today, Doug Forrester says he's pro-choice.  But to win the Republican primary, he told anti-choice groups he agreed with them.  He spent the whole campaign opposing embryonic stem cell research.  Now, just days before the election, he says his position has evolved.  He says he's for getting illegal guns off the street, but he opposed New Jersey's ban on 
[01:26:00]  assault weapons.  Why?  Doug Forrester.  How can we know what he believes when he doesn't know himself?  You know, that's, yeah, like he's that stupid.  Yeah.  You know, like he's that stupid.  He just changed it.  What do you think about stem cell research?  You said you're against it.  For it now.  For it.  For it.  For it.  For it.  For it.  He says he's for it.  He wants to get illegal guns.  Doesn't want to get illegal guns.  He says he wants to get illegal guns off the streets, yet he voted against the assault  weapons ban.  Two completely different fucking things. 
[01:26:30]  Getting illegal guns off the street is getting illegal guns off the street.  A ban on assault weapons are, people used to be able to go in to a gun store and buy what  was called an assault weapon.  Legally.  It's still, if you're buying it off of some homie on the street, it's illegal.  Doesn't matter what it is.  It could be a weapon with fucking, you know, little cotton ears on it and the cute looking  thing.  Not an assault weapon, which looks so menacing. 
[01:27:00]  It's two different things entirely.  No, but you didn't hear the music, though?  Oh, well, the music was ominous.  I mean, the music obviously tells you that this song.  You could absolutely, before getting...  Like, here's one right now.  It's got to be against Forrester, because they got slow motion Forrester.  This is the flip-flop one.  Are we taping this?  Oh, we got this right?  This is the one you just heard, yeah.  Stimself flip-flop.  All right, very good.  Doug Forrester says...  But what do you mean?  Opposed New Jersey ban on assault weapons.  All right.  And then the last one is probably the most beautiful, because John Corzine criticizes Forrester 
[01:27:30]  for his smear tactics.  Oh, great.  In the final days of the campaign, Doug Forrester has brought the Bush-Rove smear tactics to  our state.  I'm in a place for the politics of personal destruction in New Jersey.  John Corzine believes this campaign is about New Jersey's families and the future of our  state.  It's about improving education, affordable health care, cutting property taxes, and cleaning 
[01:28:00]  up corruption.  That's John Corzine's plan for New Jersey.  And no last-minute negative attacks are going to stop you from protecting our families and  our values.  No last-minute attacks.  This has been since they've launched.  They have just come out swinging.  I love it.  That is fantastic.  And the lies and deceit and twisting of words and policy on both parts.  How do you vote?  Get the quote from the wife there, the ex-wife. 
[01:28:30]  The New York Times, November 2nd, Anthony.  Joanne Corzine.  When I saw the campaign ad where Andrea Forrester said Doug never let his family down and he  won't let New Jersey down, all I could think was that John did let his family down and he'll  probably let New Jersey down too.  Maybe his wife is just a bitch on wheels and had nothing to do with why he is now her ex-husband. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, but that doesn't help the female vote.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  All the women.  Oh, look at that.  He let his family down.  He left his family.  That's the problem.  The females are losing their minds over that.  Maybe she was a cunt.  Right.  She probably was.  I'm thinking that might be the case.  Don't let her be a cunt to New Jersey.  Ah, Nate in Brooklyn.  Hey, Nate.  Good morning, guys.  What's up?  Yeah, you didn't actually get the actual commercial. 
[01:29:30]  It was Corzine's ex-wife going, it was an abortion, New Jersey.  Something evil and unholy.  An abortion.  And then he smacked her in the face.  Take care, guys.  Speaking of the Godfather, what the fuck?  What?  I was at my brother's house.  I mean, I got the Godfather on DVDs, whatever.  But my brother is watching the Godfather on Channel 11 here in New York.  Oh, why?  Exactly why, to begin with.  And it was Saturday night. 
[01:30:00]  And it's the scene in the restaurant.  Yeah.  Where, you know, he's going to whack.  Salazzo and the McCluskey.  All of a sudden, the scene is about to go down, and it says, to be continued.  What?  To be continued.  When?  Next Saturday.  What is it, 1955?  Next Saturday.  Who's watching that?  That's where I was, that's the point I want to bring up.  In 2005, who the hell is sitting there going, hey, got to wait a week? 
[01:30:30]  Who the fuck is watching only half the Godfather on commercial TV where they're going to just chop the shit out of it?  And then wait a week to see the second half.  That was something you were a victim of back, yeah, before cable even, before the ability to just tape the shit.  Yeah, like when you're watching.  Now's DVR on demand.  There's so many avenues to get these movies now without having to be at the, unbelievable, they're still doing that. 
[01:31:00]  Isn't that amazing?  Wow.  The best scene, too.  It's just about to go down, and all of a sudden, boom, to be continued.  To be continued.  This is my, like, being a kid watching, like, the Six Million Dollar Man.  Yeah.  During all those Bigfoot episodes.  You'd be like, fuck.  You're looking at the clock going, they can't tie this up.  No, don't.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  It's over, man.  Fuck, it's a two-parter.  To be continued.  And now, scenes from next week, Six Million Dollar Man.  You got to kind of try to get the story from the scenes.  Yeah, and you went to school, and you were talking about it.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  Couldn't wait.  Did you see it?  What do you think's going to happen?  I was too young.  He gets Bigfoot.  Do you think he gets the Bigfoot?  That was the old days.  I don't remember.  Too young for, yeah, I don't remember.  Six Million Dollar Man?  Nope.  Lying sack of shit.  No Filter Paul.  Opie said he was too young to watch the Six Million Dollar Man.  We started with No Filter Paul.  Yes, he was born in 1942.  We'll end with No Filter Paul.  So that was a good assault on the media.  It created a lot of controversy on the fan sites, Paul.  But I say, you keep doing them, all right?  Oh, for sure.  There's a couple other things, actually, we had mentioned is how we got directions to the crime scene. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  We actually called the police department and tried to tactfully ask where you guys caused  a child to be killed.  They didn't cause a child.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  Now, what did the guys who ran them over, what did they do?  Well, supposedly they dragged the guy.  No, no, no.  I don't know.  They just stole a car or something.  Stolen car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stolen car.  All right.  Cops are chasing them.  And after we got off the shot, the reporter turned to us and asked us if we had lives.  Oh, really? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Like, that's going to stop the pests on this radio program.  The guy jumped out of the truck and said, you guys are fucking rocket scientists, huh?  Well, you know what?  I got to tell you, we got them by the balls.  Especially here in New York City, they don't know what to do.  Because you guys are obeying the rules.  You don't touch the reporter.  There's nothing they can do.  And if they touch you and rough you up, you can sue them.  Good luck.  We're hoping they'll rough us on camera.  They have no idea what to do.  They have no idea what to do.  Right.  They're just hoping it's just going to go away. 
[01:33:00]  And another reason why we shouldn't, that we got to continue talking about it.  Because we don't want it to go away anytime soon.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  And thanks to Flea for taping it for us.  We had to drive two hours to pick it up, but we got it on video for you guys.  Flea Man from CringeHumor.net.  There you go.  All right.  Thanks, bud.  Inspiring.  There goes no filter, Paul.  He's an animal when it comes to these assaults on the media.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Is it illegal in Jersey?  I don't know.  Mitch in Cleveland? 
[01:33:30]  All kinds of assault weapons they call them.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  A 22.  Ow!  Somebody's saying a .22 caliber gun with more than 12 shots in it is considered an assault  weapon in Jersey.  Is that true?  I think they got enough laws in Jersey.  I don't think you got to worry about it anymore.  I don't know.  Mitch?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How about those Browns?  What about those Browns?  How about those Browns?  Are they doing well this year?  I don't even know. 
[01:34:00]  You know what?  I used to work for the team, and don't do it anymore.  Yeah.  But they're doing okay this year.  But who cares?  I know they won yesterday 20-14 over Tennessee.  Yeah, but Tennessee's like one of the worst teams in the league also.  They got beat by the Texans the week before.  Right.  What do you got, Mitch?  Hey, I was doing that Godfather thing.  Was it Anthony's brother was watching?  No, Opie's.  Opie's brother.  Opie was at his brother's house.  Wow, you really missed that. 
[01:34:30]  No, yeah, I did.  Isn't that the Godfather saga?  Didn't they make like a miniseries out of all the movies together?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, I mean, back when I was in college in 79, they did that before 3 ever came out.  They put them in kind of like chronological order.  Yeah, they re-cut them.  Oh, really?  So instead of doing the flashbacks back to Sicily.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, with De Niro, they did it all in chronological order.  I got you, I got you.  Yeah, and then there was some extra footage. 
[01:35:00]  But, yeah, the commercial break or the break of the one chapter was right before he goes and shoots the two guys in the restaurant.  Nah, I've seen him do it with the regular Godfather.  All right, Mitch.  I just don't understand why people would watch movies like that on regular TV.  I do it, too.  I don't know why, either.  Because I'm compelled.  All right.  I have a tough time watching it on HBO.  Yeah.  I'd rather just go out and get the DVD.  All right, Mitch.  Thank you. 
[01:35:30]  Thank you.  Wow, that was a loud phone.  His phone really went right through me.  Mike in M.O.  M.O. would be Missouri, maybe?  M.O. Montana?  I think it's Missouri.  Missouri.  All right.  Mike, what's up?  I know the definition of an assault rifle.  By federal standards, it's over a 20-round magazine, a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, bayonet lug, and a flash suppressor.  Yeah, if it has two or more of the following, then it's considered an assault weapon. 
[01:36:00]  But in Jersey, apparently, you're not even allowed to have a semi-automatic rifle.  Really?  Regardless of what it looks like.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  That was one of those symbolism over substance things, the assault weapon ban.  I don't think it really helped.  I think things like the Tech-9, the little machine pistols and the Uzis, you just don't see those anymore.  Making those illegal, they might have had a point, you know, because they kind of are easy to conceal. 
[01:36:30]  But still, I don't like any of the controls on people that are legally buying guns.  I think as far as illegal guns go, go at them.  Have a pisser.  Fucking make it really rough on those guys.  But, you know, for law-abiding citizens, like myself, Opie, want to go out and purchase, there you go.  You should be able to go to there if you're a law-abiding citizen, show your identification, have them make that call to the FBI, check you out. 
[01:37:00]  And then if you check out, you buy it.  Now you're a legal gun owner.  Assault weapon.  People hear assault weapon and they think it's a machine gun.  They think you're buying a fucking machine gun and we've got to get assault weapons off the streets.  All right, get assault weapons off the streets.  But don't make them unavailable to people that want to, you know, go down to the range and have a little fun.  That's what I did Saturday.  Yeah.  Can we talk about it at the break?  Of course.  Because my bladder's about to explode.  What do you got, P?  Holy crap. 
[01:37:30]  My whole temperature has dropped.  What kind of gun do you get?  I'm going to kill you, Bill.  No, just seriously.  Fine.  You guys continue.  What kind of game is it?  I ain't playing this game today.  I got to take a leak.  You continue.  I'll tell you after the break.  No, you guys continue.  That's a good tease.  I got to pee, too.  But you're the point, man.  You can't leave us.  Watch this.  Look at his awful acting that he's actually going to leave.  I know.  I don't think he's going to do it.  I don't think he has the balls.  I might not.  Are those acid-washed jeans?  He'll leave.  Oh, my God.  He's got on acid-washed jeans. 
[01:38:00]  Look at Opie.  I got it.  19-fucking-88.  Winger rocks, man.  Watch this.  My finger.  See it?  Uh-huh.  We'll be right back after these words.  Opie.  We're not part of regular radio, you fuckhead.  I'm scared.  Anthony.  We take nothing and make shit out of us.  Okay topic.  Los muchachos con queso.  What a hot voice that is.  Wonderful.  Huevos grandes, como melones.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Robin.  Punch out, shitheads. 
[01:38:30]  The Iron and Anthony Show.  Give it to me.  We are all on charge, yeah.  Never get it now.  Never get it now.  We are all on charge, yeah.  Give me some of that stuff.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[01:39:00]  You know what else was, um...  Wait, can I say something?  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  We just talked for an hour.  Mm-hmm.  Did a good hour of radio.  Certainly.  We should be awarded with a break that's more than two and a half minutes long.  No.  Trying to jump food down my throat.  Good luck, bro.  How long do we stop for?  Three minutes?  Four minutes?  Five minutes?  No way.  Didn't seem that long.  That was not five minutes. 
[01:39:30]  Wow.  Liar, liar.  Derek says five minutes was the length of the break.  We used to hate the 18-minute commercial breaks at WNEW when we did commercial radio,  but this is the other side of it.  Happy medium somewhere.  It's kind of crazy.  We've got to figure out how to make longer breaks for the boys.  Three minutes and, you know, 18 minutes.  Jane, Anthony, as I chew, chew, chew, chew.  My cold egg sandwich, by the way, because we talked for an hour.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Rubber.  Cold eggs.  Mm-mm-mm.  Go ahead. 
[01:40:00]  Do you know, another definition to assault weapon was if the gun has a grenade launcher.  I swear to you, it's part of the law.  Meanwhile, there was no way you were getting a grenade launcher legally before the assault  weapon ban, but they worded these things in a way where the general public goes, well,  of course we don't want grenade launchers.  You have to sign this assault weapon bill.  You weren't able to have a goddamn grenade launcher. 
[01:40:30]  And a bayonet lug on your gun, you weren't allowed, you weren't, or weren't, before the  ban expired recently, able to have a bayonet lug on your weapon.  What could that possibly do?  You're shooting people.  You're a crazed gunman with your assault weapon shooting people.  Do you think at any time you're just going to switch to fix bayonets and go on a cavalry  charge?  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  With your poor excuse for a spear.  Yeah.  You can still buy a spear, right?  A spear, sure.  You can buy that.  A suppressor on the front of your gun.  I'll eat.  You can get those.  Right next to rakes.  You got a rake with a bayonet attachment.  A suppressor on the front of the gun.  Does nothing more but make the gun look cool.  As far as this assault weapons law goes.  It does come in handy because, you know, it suppresses the flash, cuts down on the noise 
[01:41:30]  a little bit.  But it was more symbolism over substance.  The whole law.  And when the Republicans came in charge and the law expired, they didn't re-up it.  So a lot of the Democrats are coming out and going, he's against the assault weapon ban.  It didn't really do anything.  Didn't get the illegal guns out there off the streets.  Just kept law-abiding citizens from acquiring certain weaponry that I enjoy shooting. 
[01:42:00]  By the way, your question, I purchased an AR-15, which is the civilian model of the M-16.  If you play video games...  What is going on with you?  I love guns.  I always have.  You hate children.  Anthony doesn't like children.  You don't like children.  Anthony's slowly going crazy.  Yeah, you got his fucking sword.  Oh, the sword.  Who needs the sword anymore?  Anthony's slowly going crazy.  It might take up to another ten years, but it is happening. 
[01:42:30]  How many days did you have to wait before you could purchase the sword?  I bet you just walked right in and got it.  The sword I bought at a Renaissance festival.  Stainless steel rapier.  Beautiful sword.  Beautiful workmanship.  I got that.  Walked right away with it.  The rifle and shotgun.  What else was available?  Oh, God.  Other than hideous women.  Daggers.  Yeah, hideous women.  Believe me.  Hideous women.  Daggers.  Hatchets.  All kinds of, yeah, hatchets, throwing, battle axes.  You could go to these Renaissance fairs and just buy... 
[01:43:00]  These archaic, a big mace with a ball with the spikes on it with the chain and the grip.  Oh, that is one of the most brutal-looking weapons ever.  Oh, yeah.  But these are readily available for you to purchase at any restaurant festival.  Too much work to hurt somebody, by the way.  Yeah.  A stick with a chain and a ball with spikes on it.  You probably just want to hurt it yourself.  Yeah, that nunchuck quality where, you know, one out of ten times you catch yourself in the thigh.  Any weapon where you have to rev it up.  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  Get some speed going.  Yeah, it could definitely clunk you.  I went to the range on Saturday, though.  Fired off the AR for the first time.  Nice.  They have a five-shot limit, five-round limit in your clips.  Magazines.  Sorry, a lot of the pros don't like it called a clip.  I don't know why.  But, and I have these 30-round banana clips, just these big, you know, slap them in. 
[01:44:00]  You can just fire.  And I had to use my ten-round and just put five in there.  What did you shoot at?  Everything is nice.  I had just a target about 50 yards away.  Did you get to throw faces on the targets or anything?  No.  Just go out there with a target with a bullseye and surrounding concentric circles.  And, yeah, 50 yards out.  There's 100 yards, so I was shooting 50.  Do you have those John Goodman yellow-tinged glasses when you go out there?  No, I was using just clear safety glasses and earplugs. 
[01:44:30]  There's a couple of videos up online of me shooting.  And one time the recoil knocked the earplug out of my ear.  It looks like a real pro.  And I have what's called an EOTech holographic sight on the thing, which is just ridiculous.  It takes all the sporting right out of it.  Once this thing is dialed in, you're putting shots in the bullseye without issue, without problem.  You put the red dot on the target. 
[01:45:00]  That's it.  It's over, Johnny.  Bam, bam, bam.  As fast as you pull the trigger.  Jack has a great point in Boston.  Go ahead, Jack.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Jack.  I have a question, guys.  Why would a band on a soul weapons expire but not a band on bottomless dancing at bars?  Yeah, why did that, like, have some kind of endless run?  I mean, the bottomless law at tit bars.  What happened?  You used to be able to dance around the girls without bottoms. 
[01:45:30]  It used to be full bottom.  You know, you'd see pussy, you'd see ass, you'd see tits.  Long Island, New York City, everywhere.  And then some politician had to come in and go, well, you need to cover the girls up.  And now that guy is long gone.  Now that guy's gone.  And now we're stuck with this law.  Because you are not getting a politician that will ever come up and go, we need to get the underwear off the girls at the strip joints.  I know.  What a dick.  You can't get, once that law's passed, it's over, you don't get it back.  I thought it was just the alcohol.  If there's alcohol, you can't see a pussy.  It depends where you are.  You made all kinds of rules. 
[01:46:00]  But you want to drink, and you want to...  All we know, Long Island doesn't have it anymore.  One dude got involved and changed the law, and now he's retired and we're stuck with this shit.  Yeah.  I see the video of you shooting at me.  Was that the one of me, the thing falling out of my ear?  Yeah, but look at you, man.  Look at all the stuff you've got to do to aim.  I was sighting it in.  My earplug comes out.  I was still sighting it in.  You know what's funny?  That's the same footage that they're going to show when he gets fucking arrested for something. 
[01:46:30]  Look at him.  Here he is shooting a weapon.  Do you have a .50 caliber?  No, no.  I'd like to acquire one of those.  I saw one of them this weekend.  There was some show on TV and somebody, you know, drug dealer shot this other guy with this .50 caliber.  And it's like such a rare gun.  Oh, was it a pistol or a rifle?  Yeah, I've seen this thing at the gun store I go to.  It's gigantic.  It's huge.  I even said to the guy behind the counter, I go, that is ridiculous.  And he goes, in typical gun store employee fashion, he goes, you're staring down a grizzly bear. 
[01:47:00]  You won't think that's so ridiculous.  Yeah, they always have an answer to any, like, gun quip that you make.  They always have an answer to it.  That's great.  And they're all packing crazy.  Has there ever been a lunatic that's trying to rob a gun store?  Because the guys walking around are just packed.  They're pistols on their hips.  They're fucking all armed.  They're loaded, locked, ready to rock and roll if anybody comes in there with any shenanigans on their mind. 
[01:47:30]  Aryan magazine hanging out of the back of the fucking...  Changing gears slightly.  Because this has something to do with violence as well.  Violence?  You were on a range shooting and stuff over the weekend, right?  Yeah.  I saw something that I think every person needs to see in America.  Oh, what's that?  It is one of the most entertaining things you could go to.  I went and saw my little nephew's football game.  Oh.  He's seven.  Seven. 
[01:48:00]  Full contact tackle football.  They have little equipment for them?  Dude.  That sounds adorable.  It is the most violent thing you'll ever see in your life.  Kids running off the field, screaming, crying, bleeding.  They're seven years old.  Really?  My brother goes, hey, you want to go see Carson's game this Sunday?  We had a christening and then we're all in our suits and we go to the field to check out his game, right?  And I don't think it's going to be all cute and nice.  Like, oh, yeah, a little seven-year-old's playing football.  How cute.  Full contact tackle. 
[01:48:30]  Taking it serious.  They got plays.  Wow.  The quarterback yelling.  I was amazed.  Absolutely amazed.  Every other play, there's a kid running off the field, crying, looking for their mommy.  They don't even tackle each other.  Don't they just, when they bump into each other, they just both fall down?  They both fall down.  There's some kids with some skills where they just will do open field tackles and everything.  It's sick.  It is sick.  I'm not bringing this up to say how cute it was that I saw my nephew playing football. 
[01:49:00]  I'm bringing it up because it was unbelievable to me.  Like, kids with messed up fingers and bleeding and they're trying to find their mommy on the sidelines.  Yeah, football.  Then you got the tough father like, yeah, it's all right.  It's not broken.  You'll be okay.  Football's not a sport.  You should start out at that age.  Here's a French fry.  Get back in the game.  You shouldn't start out at that age.  Because football players wind up getting so fucked up so early in life when they start, you know, in junior high, let's say, or high school, when they really start their football careers. 
[01:49:30]  And then, you know, by the time they're in their mid-20s, they're falling apart.  Yeah.  What if a kid's starting at 7?  Search out.  There's going to be like these injuries by 12, 13 years old.  They're going to be all fucked up.  Got a hip replacement.  Yeah, knees.  You see tackling, and you're like, oh, my God.  Do yourself a favor and search out a real football league where 7-year-olds are playing.  Yeah, I do.  Every weekend.  I videotape them.  My nephew's team had this animal.  Hope you enjoy 7-year-olds tackling each other. 
[01:50:00]  My nephew's team had this animal that was a linebacker just making every other tackle just destroying kids.  He's like twice the size of all the other 7-year-olds.  It was just ugly.  He looked like he could play in the NFL already, just how he moved on the field.  But it was hilarious seeing these kids running out, just screaming bloody murder, crying.  It was unbelievable.  Like, this is what parents do on a weekend?  They go to their son's football games at 7?  There were two extremely hot chicks that were about 16 years old at the range. 
[01:50:30]  They're doing, like, target shooting competition.  So they were down there training.  And they're just in these little tight jeans, little shirts that are coming up a little so their belly and lower back shows.  And they're just slinging lead out there shooting.  Everyone.  And the guys that work at the range are like, you know, to see how many women are showing up these days just wanting to shoot. 
[01:51:00]  But everybody just wants to shoot.  Everybody.  Especially, you know, in Long Island with the home invasions.  A lot of people have jumped on and picked up some.  I played football one year.  I played in, like, third or fourth grade.  And I consider myself, I was, like, decent speed, you know?  Mm-hmm.  And when I got all that equipment on, I was, like, one of the slowest fucking people.  And my fucking cup kept rubbing on, like, the inside of my legs.  I swear to God.  Years later, when I got to high school, I realized, I'm like, this fucking cup still fits me. 
[01:51:30]  My dad bought me a fucking adult-sized cup.  Adult cup for a kid.  So I was literally running down, and the fucking thing was rubbing on the inside of my thighs.  It's like having a Tupperware container attached to your groin.  Which has effectively ended any sort of career I could have had.  I wanted to play wide receiver.  I ended up playing, like, left guard.  Like this fucking kid, you know?  If you're in third grade and you're on the offensive line, that's like playing right field in Little League.  You just suck. 
[01:52:00]  You might have been somebody if you didn't have the cup.  No, no, I was kidding.  I would have played at the division.  I would have played at Curry College.  Let's say hi to Andy in New York.  Hey, Andy.  How you doing, guys?  What's up?  How you doing, guys?  I coach my son's seven-year-old soccer team.  The league has these stacked teams where the coaches got together, decided they'd take all the best players,  put them on the best teams, and score everybody else.  I coach the Bad News Bears.  Son fucking will.  Yesterday, the country other team is a bragging to me. 
[01:52:30]  These are seven-year-old kids.  He says to me, you know, we haven't lost a game at three years old.  I mean, what are you saying to me?  They've been playing together since they're four?  Yeah.  They haven't lost a game since they're four years old.  And he's proud of this.  He's proud of this shit.  All right, Andy.  Yeah, they take it very seriously.  I noticed that yesterday as well.  Betty in Connecticut.  Hello.  How are you?  All right.  I totally agree with you.  Football for a seven-year-old is frigging hysterical.  I cannot wait until my son turns seven and can go play. 
[01:53:00]  I will never say it's wrong, but it's hilarious because the kids, I don't think they know what they're getting into.  I think it's the parents pushing them, you know, toward a sport.  And they're running off the field like, what the, this isn't baseball.  You know, just real injuries.  I'm not talking about kids being kids.  I'm talking about real injuries you see in a regular football game when the pros are playing, you know?  You know what?  I got to tell you, I got to tell you, the kids love it and the parents are hysterical.  I live across the street from a park.  Last week they had a game. 
[01:53:30]  It went dark.  All the parents put their cars so the headlights were on the field so the kids could play.  Yeah, because I think the parents secretly love the violence as well.  Yeah.  They do.  All right, thank you.  See ya.  I like the fact that when the kids get home, they're just spent.  Doing it in third grade, they were making you do like those leg lifts.  You don't even have abs at that point.  You're like throwing out your fucking seven-year-old lower back.  You're like, I can't have you do all this shit.  I remember I literally, this is the 70s when you get hit kids too.  Yeah.  I would literally take my thigh pads and I would push them to the side because this trucker who 
[01:54:00]  was my coach would literally come up and if you couldn't keep your legs up, he would  kick you in the side of your leg.  What a dumbass.  And your fucking parents were standing right there when he did it.  Yeah.  The guy's got the whole buzz cut and shit.  Gym class was like nasty and violent back then.  Not even if you were on the team, just being in gym class, the presidential physical fitness  test that you had to do every year, pull-ups and then sit-ups, and they'd make you do sit-ups  on the wooden gym floor. 
[01:54:30]  So your little spines?  Oh, yeah, your little cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck-cuck.  I know what it is.  Yeah, the ass bone.  Your ass bone is just crinkling and crackling on the floor.  It's getting wedged between the space and the parquet floor.  How awful was it the first time you ever tried to do a pull-up?  You just never used those muscles in real life.  Little, like, stick arms.  And then what's worse is there's the coach.  Come on, you pussy faggot! 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  You can't do one!  Every girl you had a crush on is watching you.  Yeah.  Subconsciously, already nature's like, I can't mate with that.  Oh, because the physical fitness test, yeah, they'd open the accordion doors and the girls  can watch the guys, the girls can watch the girls go through the tests on that one.  No.  They'd shut the doors when it was something you had any talent in.  But when you're doing this, you know, pull-ups and stuff.  Look at this idiot.  He can't do one.  The best was square dancing.  Why? 
[01:55:30]  Well, that was...  Why did we have to square dance?  That was the first sexual feeling, sexual kind of contact between the guys and girls  when I was growing up.  Because they started in, I don't know, third or fourth grade or something like that.  I don't even know what it was.  And they would open up the doors and it was square dancing.  So you'd choose partners and hold hands.  And it would start with a big circle, guy-girl, guy-girl, guy-girl.  And you're holding hands with girls.  And it was kind of the first time you had any physical contact like that with a girl. 
[01:56:00]  Where, all right, now when you dance, all right, grab her around the waist.  Now grab her hand.  And you're just getting a throbbing boner because it's your first touch.  I couldn't breathe.  I was like...  You're too loose.  I was doing the...  I don't need to breathe.  Don't you wish you could go back to that level of innocence somehow?  Can you imagine what it would be like to go to a strip club with that, like, mentality?  First time I went to a strip club, I think I was, like, 13 years old.  It was the Tender Trap across from Jericho Turnpike. 
[01:56:30]  Was there a 13?  Tender Trap?  It was...  That's a legendary place, though.  Because I lived right across the street from it.  You know where Fred Steiner was?  I tried all the time.  And one day, the guy behind the bar just let me in.  All the women behind the bar would never let me in.  Once there was a guy behind the bar, it was early.  It was, like, early on a Saturday morning or something.  I decided, fuck the cartoons.  I'm walking across the street.  And I had quarters that I had stolen from my mother.  It wasn't even like I went in there with cash. 
[01:57:00]  I had quarters, a handful of quarters.  And went in, put them down, and just said, bottle of Bud.  And he gave it to me.  Thirteen.  Thirteen.  You know he already had a goatee.  I had the problem.  Same goatee.  And I just nursed it and couldn't breathe.  I was like...  Just like my leg was soaked when I was...  It was just a mess.  But it was great.  It was like, yeah, that whole... 
[01:57:30]  You didn't even have to touch it back then.  No.  Dude, I remember the first time...  I think I was, like, in, like, fourth or fifth grade.  And I'd been sick a couple of days.  So the teacher told this girl in the class to come over and help me catch up with some stuff.  And she was literally standing over me, pointing what exercises we'd done.  And I had a fucking raging heart on.  And I was like...  Yeah, you can't breathe straight.  Just literally the smell of a female.  That's what did it.  Oh.  You were just raging. 
[01:58:00]  Now you're just filing through all your porn.  I can't do this.  Yeah, fuck me.  Yeah, such thing.  And then I'd be...  You just want the innocence back.  Yeah, just be so much cheaper.  You'd be at the strip club and watching.  And I could never understand the guys that would come in for work, like, lunchtime at work or something.  And they're talking to each other.  Like, they're not looking.  And they'd take an occasional glance up at the dancer.  And they would just, like, be talking about work and drinking beer.  I couldn't understand that. 
[01:58:30]  It's like, why wouldn't you just lock your eyes on this nude woman in front of you for the entire time you're here like I'm doing?  Like, this sick fuck is doing.  I mean, imagine looking away.  These women are awesome.  Yeah, this is fantastic.  They're great.  And then they're like, I gotta leave.  I got like an inch of warm Budweiser at the bottom of this.  I gotta leave.  And then you see another girl walk in and put money in the jukebox and start pushing buttons. 
[01:59:00]  She's...  I gotta see this chick naked.  A new chick.  She's gonna be naked any second now and I can't leave.  I'm, like, wetting my lips like I have the last canteen in the desert.  Just wetting my lips with beer and licking it.  All right, listen.  We have to get to Paradise because this is the only day this week Bill's gonna be here.  Because Paradise is going away.  It's one of our favorite things.  But first, we gotta talk about the guy that is suing Home Depot. 
[01:59:30]  Oh.  It was at a Home Depot?  Yeah, man sues Home Depot after using glue-covered toilets.  Little gag.  This was in Colorado.  Home Depot was sued by a shopper from a Kentucky store who claims he got stuck to a restroom toilet seat  because a prankster had smeared it with glue.  That's being a prankster.  Wouldn't you know right away, though?  Yeah, but first of all, you don't sit on a public toilet and if you go into it, you build a little nest.  You build the toilet paper nest?  Yes.  And even if you don't, any sign of wetness, you're up immediately. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Immediately.  He was taking a hell of a dump.  Oh, that's an amazing glue.  Yeah, he might have really had to go bad.  What kind of glue is that?  Crazy glue will do it.  Yeah, but I don't know.  Well, maybe, I mean, it's Home Depot, so.  Crazy glue would do it.  They even have stronger glue than Crazy glue.  Because unless you push it together, if you put some Crazy glue in a dot around the toilet seat,  that shit will just sit there active just waiting for you.  It won't really dry that well.  What do you want, though?  You can rip your ass off the seat.  Crazy glue?  Nope.  I'm ripping it off. 
[02:00:30]  Get some Crazy glue.  So how did you find him in there?  Get Bill.  Get Bill the intern.  No.  He'll do it, though.  Fucking a crazy.  One little dot.  He'll do it.  You think?  I would so rip my ass off the seat.  I'm not sitting there waiting for someone to help me out.  Help me.  I will deal with whatever happens.  Bring some paint thinner.  I will deal.  You'll deal with the skin graft.  Usually for a skin graft, they take the skin from your ass.  So you're really ripping that off.  Now where are they going to get it from?  Your forehead?  Stand up.  I'm not sitting there on the toilet and having Home Depot come in and try to figure out what 
[02:01:00]  to do with me.  I will take care of the situation myself, and then I'll assess the damages at home, and  then I'll figure it out.  Hopefully you already bought a screwdriver so you can unscrew the seat and just fucking  take it with you.  Walk out.  Well, Bob, he's 57.  Bob.  Bob Daugherty.  Oh, poor Bob.  He's 57.  Is he working there?  Accused employees of ignoring his cries for help for about 15 minutes because they thought  he was kidding. 
[02:01:30]  Help!  They left me there going through all that stress.  They just let me rot.  The lawsuit filed Friday says Daugherty was recovering from heart bypass surgery and thought  he was having a heart attack when he got stuck at the store in Louisville on the day  before Halloween.  Oh, boy.  This goes back a couple years, actually.  A store employee who heard him calling for help informed the head clerk by radio, but  the head clerk believed it to be a hoax, the lawsuit said.  Home Depot spokeswoman Catherine Gallagher said she could not comment on pending litigation. 
[02:02:00]  How could anyone hearing someone yell for help just assume it's a hoax without checking  first?  Ah, that old gag.  Yeah.  Ah, the old screaming for help ploy.  What?  You're supposed to yell fire.  Yeah.  Fire.  That's what you're supposed to do.  If you yell help, people won't help or, yeah, you don't yell rape.  Yeah.  You yell fire.  And then people will flee.  You yell, she's got her tits out.  People come.  Immediately.  Taron.  The lawsuit said store officials called for an ambulance after about 15 minutes. 
[02:02:30]  Paramedics unbolted the toilet seat, and as they wheeled the frightened and humiliated  Daugherty out of the store, he passed out.  The lawsuit said the toilet seat separated from his skin, leaving abrasions.  This is not Home Depot's fault, he said, but I am blaming them for letting me hang in  there and just ignoring me.  So how much is he suing for?  How much?  You know what?  How much does that work?  How much does that work?  Abrasions is not a good word in a lawsuit.  Abrasions.  That sounds like they healed in three days. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  I had abrasions.  Abrasions.  Let's go to the tape here.  We got some audio.  Okay, Bob.  Wow.  Start at the beginning.  This was two years ago.  I understand this was...  What the hell is going on?  What is Bob doing?  Is that Bob going...  Oh, yes.  Nathaniel.  Yeah.  Anytime he's not speaking, you'll hear that noise.  Are you kidding?  No.  Why is that?  I thought this was audio of Anthony at the strip club. 
[02:03:30]  We got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  That's why they didn't come.  No one's going to walk in if you're making those noises in the background.  Help.  Help.  He's jerking off.  Oh, Billy.  Holy...  I don't think I can listen to this stupid interview now.  Interesting.  All you can hear after a while.  Listen to this.  Okay, Bob.  Wow.  Start at the beginning.  This was two years ago.  I understand this was right before Halloween, so it was part of a Halloween prank at a Home 
[02:04:00]  Depot near Boulder, Colorado?  This is correct.  Tell me what happened.  I went into Home Depot to do some shopping, and having a little bit of a sour stomach,  I'd gone to the restroom and sat down prior to doing so.  I was going to get one of those plastic covers that they have for those things, and the dispenser  was empty.  So I just went on, or had gone ahead to, you know, continue on in the business, and so  after a fashion, I'd noticed that I tried to lift my legs up, that I was actually stuck, 
[02:04:30]  glued.  So after trying to get up, and trying to get up, you know, and the more I'd try, the more  I couldn't, and I knew I'd figure out some way out of this mess.  Males are problem solvers, and so that's exactly what I was trained to do with you.  Yeah.  What a fucking sexist ass.  She probably was all of a sudden happy, because, you know, males are problem solvers.  What?  What does that have to do with it? 
[02:05:00]  Don't.  Trying to do it, you know.  Yeah.  Yes, indeed.  You know us guys, we don't need a road map.  Yeah.  So anyway, after some time, an employee had come in.  I hadn't known as an employee until after I'd read the police report, but somebody had come  in, and I asked him to get the hold of the manager for some help, and so he did so, and  the manager just instructed him to get back to work, and they just ignored my plight.  I actually refused my plight.  Refused.  No.  That is harsh. 
[02:05:30]  That is a little harsh.  I need to sit in there.  People are knocking on the door.  Stuck to the toilet.  You don't know what to do.  Oh, God.  So how long were you sitting there?  For me to determine that is difficult.  You know, when you're going through a lot of stress like that, at the moment, you don't  really watch your watch.  Somewhere 20, 25 minutes, I suppose.  And you know, it's easy to kind of mock this whole thing and make fun of it, but for anybody  who's ever used super glue and gotten their fingers stuck. 
[02:06:00]  Evidently, they use this in surgery.  It's pretty painful and must have been.  So paramedics, I understand, arrived, and instead of, I guess, putting some kind of solvent  on that would get you unstuck, they actually removed the whole toilet.  Is that what happened?  The whole toilet.  I didn't hear a word she said.  I did not hear a word she said.  I think he made it up.  He just had a crush on her and he wanted to get near her.  He's going to come at the end of this.  He should, he should, exactly, he should fuck that girl from the beginning. 
[02:06:30]  This guy is so horny, I think it's just sperm all over the place and he's stuck on everything.  It's like the perverted version.  What is that tonight?  Woohoo!  Yeah!  The early 90s.  It takes two to make a bingo ride. 
[02:07:00]  Jan's got to go on.  Jan?  Hi.  Hi.  We love that the women are finally calling this radio program.  Thank God.  Ladies.  I love it.  I listen to it every day.  I'm one of the four-hour listeners.  Oh, thanks, Jan.  Thank you, Jan.  I was wondering if you could tell at the beginning when he started talking, he sounds like Bill  Murray in Caddyshack.  Yeah, the famous scene.  Really?  Yeah.  That's what it sounds like to him.  I'll have to hear.  I didn't hear that.  I'll have to listen on the replay.  I didn't catch that one.  Thank you, Jan.  Thanks.  Bye. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  Instead of, I guess, putting some kind of solvent on that would get you unstuck, they  actually removed the whole toilet?  Is that what happened?  The whole toilet seat and lifted up with me out of the stall and then laying me on a stretcher.  About that point, I had passed out, and the ambulance crew had jumped on top of me in a  difficult time, finding a pulse and very little shallow breathing, if they could find that.  He's still shallow breathing.  Jesus.  This guy. 
[02:08:00]  Wow.  This guy has some kind of fetish that has something to do with toilets, I'm telling you.  He is so turned on that he gets to go on national TV and talk about this.  If he does that just every time he's not talking, he's undateable.  Yeah.  There's no way.  I don't care how good your stories are, how much you're making the girl laugh.  Whenever she's talking, you're going...  All right.  Tell me a little bit, Mark, about the lawsuit.  Why are you filing this lawsuit?  And $3 million seems like a lot of money. 
[02:08:30]  The reason we're filing the lawsuit is twofold.  Wait a minute.  First of all...  It's the lawyer.  That's somebody else.  Yeah, you get the lawyer, and then you get the creep still...  Oh, the lawyer was talking?  Oh, okay.  I thought he was like a ventriloquist who could drink water and talk at the same time.  All right.  Tell me a little bit, Mark, about the lawsuit.  Why are you filing this lawsuit?  This is why I fucking hate, like, just these phony asses that do these TV shows. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  This is happening.  Why wouldn't you just talk about it and go, what...  Why are you doing that?  What is the...  Why...  How could she just sit there and make believe she's not hearing...  Because, you know, as soon as the cameras go off, they're all talking about it.  As soon as that guy left the set and they go to a commercial, they're all talking like,  holy crap, what was up with that guy?  We bring it up in here when anybody's sitting down and you hear...  Right.  But I don't understand.  Like, you're live.  Why wouldn't you... 
[02:09:30]  Why wouldn't you, you know, bring this up?  Why?  It's not the Opie and Anthony show.  It's a news show.  Maybe they're having some tact or cooth.  Oh, I would just be laughing openly.  Of course.  Right at the guy.  Oh, like you laughed at that guy with that huge camera?  Do you remember that?  Oh, yeah.  And that was a friend of yours?  It was a comedian I started out with who's struggling in the business.  He wanted a picture with me and proceeds to take out a camera that looked like a fucking  viewmaster from like 1974. 
[02:10:00]  And Opie just opened...  He's just laughing at him.  He hands the camera...  It's so fucking old.  Whoever was trying to take the picture couldn't figure out how to use it.  Oh, no.  It had everything but that hood that you stand underneath.  What was it called?  Like a view something camera?  It looked like it was from Europe.  I forgot to tell you, Anthony.  I went to Avery Fisher Hall on Friday.  I was in town.  I said, what the hell, man?  All the boys were playing there.  You had Dennis Leary, Lenny Clark, Nick DiPaolo, Jeffrey Ross, Bill Burr, and Patrice O'Neal. 
[02:10:30]  Did I miss anybody?  No.  And everyone killed.  I think I am missing someone in that lineup.  But everyone killed.  And then I went to the after hours party.  We're all hanging out.  And Bill goes, hey, this guy's a big fan of whatever he wants a picture.  I'm like, yeah, cool.  And he breaks out this camera that I haven't seen in...  It has to be 15 years.  It has to be.  It looked like it was waterproof.  Did he have the big thing with the gunpowder? 
[02:11:00]  And the guy didn't find it funny that I was laughing at his camera, because I bet you that  this guy bought this camera 15 years ago, and he's one of these guys that takes really  good care of everything he owns.  And to him, that's the greatest camera ever.  No, he's broke.  Oh.  Oh, is that it?  And the whole thing was, then you're in Manhattan.  It was in those, the Time Warner.  Towers.  Towers.  You know, it's a real, you know, classy looking place.  Everyone's got their little digital cameras, and he pulls this thing out. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, it's an awkward moment.  Decent people like myself stare at the floor.  Opie just stares at the camera, looks at the guy, and just starts laughing.  Really hard, Ant.  I can't even hold it back, because I'm like, are you kidding me?  It's, you know, first of all, you don't see many digital cameras, you know, cameras  that aren't digital cameras, except for maybe the quick ones you buy from, you know, the  corner store.  Even those are digital now.  Most of those are digital now.  You're right.  So, yeah, I openly laughed.  And then, then later on, like, you push me on him again, and so I'm standing there 
[02:12:00]  awkwardly, like, ugh, what do I say to this guy?  Like, and I go, hey, we'll have to get you on the show someday, because I guess he has  stories about Bob Keller or something.  I go, hey, we'll have to get you on the show.  See, by the way, it's Opie.  That's it.  What happened?  Uh, we'll get you on the show someday.  That's when Ben says, there's some guy downstairs, and, and Ben complains about this all the time.  There's some guy downstairs that Opie invited him up, or. 
[02:12:30]  Dude, this is my, this is my curse, though.  You don't go out a lot.  When you go out, there's, these people are looking at you like, you know, you could do  something for them.  So it's always an awkward thing.  So, I, that's what I just say, like, that's why I say someday, I make it very gray.  Vague.  Because they all look at, uh, in these situations anyway, a lot of these up and coming comics  and stuff, they look at me like I could do something for them.  So they're, they're staring and like, so I'm like, uh, well, uh, maybe we'll get you on  the show someday.  You know what's funny, though?  You're combining two different people. 
[02:13:00]  The first guy.  Well, that was another situation, right?  With, with, with, with the camera.  Yeah.  That was not the guy who came up to you and asked to be on the show.  I know, but this happens a lot.  Oh, okay, okay.  No, this happens a lot, though.  So I don't know, I, I, I'm, I'm in an awkward situation, so I, I kind of keep it gray.  I'm like, hey, someday we'll get you on the show, you know?  You should go.  I said that once to a comedian at Caroline's.  It was about a year ago.  Oh, my God, still to this day.  And he's funny, not even a year ago, maybe like seven, eight months ago.  And he's funny and stuff.  I go, hey, you know, I, I went back and said hi to him. 
[02:13:30]  I'm like, hey, you were pretty funny.  We'll have to get you on the show someday.  Meaning, if the situation's right and the right people around, we would do it, right?  This guy's manager calls Ben on a weekly basis, basically saying,  Ope said that this guy should come on the show.  I'm like, no, I was just being polite.  Oh, you mean my manager?  The moron who's supposed to be sending the DVD and ends up fucking, there's nothing on it,  but then gives you a whole DVD of every other client?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're just manager and agent, like, websites where they trade stories on message boards 
[02:14:00]  about how they fuck their clients over.  So anyway, the guy with the camera, he says he's got a story about Bob Kelly,  and he was, like, nervously talking to me, so I was just being nice.  I'm like, we'll have to get you on the show someday.  And Anthony, he pauses, and he just stares around like this, and, and he's really uncomfortable.  And he just said, I swear, and it's a line from the old days.  He just goes, you mean me?  You mean me?  That's what he said to me.  You mean me?  I'm like, yeah, you. 
[02:14:30]  Like, someday when Bob's in, if you've got these stories.  He just told everybody he knows that he's going to be on the radio.  And he's like, you think so?  Oh, boy.  I'm like, oh, my God.  I'm like, oh, wow.  Oh, I've got to say hi to Richie.  Just arrived at Bonnie.  You're giving milk to stray cats.  Yep.  That's what you're doing.  That's what you're doing.  And meow, meow, meow at the door.  So, anyway, getting back to this guy from the Today Show this morning.  Stuck to a toilet seat at Home Depot. 
[02:15:00]  So, now we've got the lawyer talking, and we've got the creep still moaning in the backseat.  All right, tell me a little bit, Mark, about the lawsuit.  Why are you filing this lawsuit, and $3 million seems like a lot of money.  The reason we're filing the lawsuit is twofold.  First of all, we've alleged that...  First of all, I'm a lawyer, and I'm a scumbag, and I...  That's what I do.  Yeah, I can't wait for this answer.  First of all, we've alleged that Home Depot has completely failed to maintain its restrooms. 
[02:15:30]  And as Bob said, they had these sanitary seat covers there.  At least they had a dispenser for them, but they failed to stock it or check the restroom.  And then the second reason is that, as Bob mentioned, when the store employee told the manager that Bob was stuck, they did nothing.  And so he sat there for 20 minutes.  All right, so that's worth $3 million?  That's worth $3 million, right?  Some people call it a sanitary toilet cover. 
[02:16:00]  I just call it toilet pad.  The lawyers are the worst.  I fucking hate just about all of them.  I saw this thing this weekend.  Just about all of them.  This guy was on death row for a murder he didn't commit.  Spent 19 years there.  People tried to rape him, beat the shit out of him.  So they decide that his time spent behind bars, once they figured out he was innocent, was worth $100 a day.  Came out to about $600,000.  $100 a day?  Yeah.  Just, you know, try not to get raped for 20 fucking years.  Beaten.  So his lawyer took like $300,000 of it. 
[02:16:30]  Got like 30% of it.  Oh, man.  Did something ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  And then he put the rest in the stock market and he lost it all.  I think he's going to kill for real for the first time.  Yeah.  But instead he got raped again.  Oh, brutal.  Exactly.  We got one more clip here.  I know Bob says that it caused chemical burns, torn skin, emotional pain and stress.  Even a psychiatrist diagnosed you with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by this incident. 
[02:17:00]  Now, Home Depot released a statement saying, while we regret that this unusual and unfortunate incident happened to Mr. Doherty in one of our stores two years ago, his demand for $3 million is excessive.  The Home Depot takes our customer safety very seriously.  We work very hard every day to see that millions of customers have a safe and enjoyable shopping experience.  The Home Depot intends to vigorously defend itself in the lawsuit.  Do you think they're going to settle out of court?  I can't imagine they are going to go through with this.  What do you think? 
[02:17:30]  You know, Katie, I never predict those things.  We're from a small town up in the mountains.  We're near Boulder, Colorado.  And I remember all the press and the media coverage from the JonBenet Ramsey case.  And if Home Depot wants to see that kind of press coverage and have Bob talk about how he thought he was having a heart attack and whatnot, then we can try the case.  How did they tie in JonBenet Ramsey with a guy getting his ass stuck in a toilet?  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  That's what he was breathing for, the big buildup to JonBenet.  And the lawyer's not being honest either.  Why wouldn't the lawyer just turn to his client and go, well, you shut the fuck up?  You're fucking up the case.  No, it looks great.  What are you, kidding?  You think?  You probably told him, dude, just do that all the time, no matter where you are.  Every time you do it, it's cha-ching.  You make a good point.  The guy never did that before the toilet seat thing.  Right.  You know, they're in the lawyer office and like, all right, let's practice.  Yeah.  I'll say...  Yeah, add some rocking to it. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to say the Home Depot statement, and your line is...  Right.  Good.  Let's work through that a couple more times.  Every time you see it here at Home Depot.  Dude, that's not worth $3 million.  He got abrasions.  They should just give him some lumber.  Yeah.  Maybe like a hammer or something like that.  Gift card.  Yeah, give him a gift card.  One of those big dopey orange Homer toolboxes that you buy there.  Right.  Hey, there's another glue story in the Daily News today. 
[02:19:00]  Another glue story?  This one is pretty funny, too.  Someone's wondering who wiped his ass.  You can't really wipe if you're stuck to the seat.  Depends on how much space.  I mean, if you sit more towards the front.  If just the front of his legs were stuck, let's say.  But if they had put some glue to the back of the seat, where the main part of his cheeks are,  he wouldn't be able to lift up enough to get his hand there, maybe between the legs.  I'm going to say that there's enough space. 
[02:19:30]  You're going to say.  Unless he has a huge ass.  I'm speculating here.  That's all.  Well, I want to know this, then.  All right.  So he goes to the hospital with a dirty ass?  In the toilet seat?  Do they help him out, or do they make him wipe his own ass at that point?  They wipe his ass.  If he had a problem.  If he had had a problem in there, they wipe his ass for him.  It's a hospital.  They're used to that shit.  Like, all right.  I'd go in with that thing you have at the self-serve car wash.  One of those sprays. 
[02:20:00]  Spread them.  Rick, what's up?  You know, if I was going to pull this joke on somebody, I would steal all the toilet pads before I glued the seat.  Yeah, of course.  So if the attorney's saying that there was no toilet pads and it wasn't maintained correctly, it's just full of shit.  Yeah, I think it was just somebody pulling a gag.  Exactly.  And stealing those.  It's not Home Depot's fault.  And the other glue thing, there was something going on where somebody put someone's genitals to their stomach.  Yeah, I got this.  It was in the paper the other day.  I got the story in front of me now. 
[02:20:30]  I thought this was one of those dumb, you know, stories that you can't prove, but it's in some pretty big paper, so I guess it's got to be true.  It's got to be true then, right?  It says AP, Anthony, so it's got to be true.  A Pennsylvania man yesterday testified that an ex-lover really stuck it to him using super glue to attach his penis to his belly and then, if that's not bad enough, sealing his rear end shut.  Dr. Zachary Smith, by the way. 
[02:21:00]  Before a jury, Kenneth Slabby detailed the shock of waking up with a misplaced member and a burning sensation in his nether regions.  I woke up in extreme pain, he said.  My whole groin area was on fire.  The 58-year-old grandpa pressed charges against ex-flame Gail O'Toole after she manhandled his manhood. 
[02:21:30]  How funny is that?  Her name is O'Toole.  This always works out in the goofy stories, though.  The penis story, yeah, O'Toole.  O'Toole.  How is that only a misdemeanor?  To glue somebody's ass shut?  Shouldn't that be some low-grade felony?  It should definitely be a felony.  I would think it would be.  She pleaded to a misdemeanor there.  Pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault and has already served six months probation. 
[02:22:00]  Now Slabby is looking to score $30,000 in a civil suit.  $30,000?  Wait a minute.  We've got a problem here.  A guy wants $3 million.  For just being stuck to a toilet seat.  With his ass.  Right.  This guy's looking for $30,000 for his dick and his ass shut.  A homeless person just finished the New York City Marathon.  Congratulations.  What is that, one day, 16 hours and 51 minutes?  I don't know.  When did it start? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, probably.  Congratulations to the homeless lady that just finished the New York City Marathon.  Anyway, so $3 million for just being stuck to a toilet seat.  Yeah.  And this guy wants $30,000 for having his rear end shut, closed, and his penis glued to his belly.  And his sack was glued to his thighs, right?  Really?  That's what I read in the first report.  Well, it's an older guy, so he glued his sack, yeah.  He stretched those things out like a batwing.  Turkish cappy. 
[02:23:00]  God, is that guy a heavy sleeper, huh?  Yeah.  No shit, Phil.  No shit.  So, Slabby is looking to score $30,000 in a civil suit that accuses O'Toole, 56, of outrageous and inhumane acts after a night of dancing.  He suffered no permanent damage.  An attorney for O'Toole said Slabby consented to having his genitals glued and that he suffered no permanent damage.  So, he consented to this.  I wonder what he did to her. 
[02:23:30]  Hell hath no fury.  Yeah.  Well, it doesn't make sense, though, because she says that he consented to this, but he also says that O'Toole waited until he was asleep to put her superglue scheme to work.  He said she smeared gobs of the sticky substance onto his penis and backside and applied nail polish to his hair.  Slabby said he woke up to a horrifying discovery and a screeching woman.  Why is the woman screeching? 
[02:24:00]  It's like misery.  She's standing over the side of the bed.  Oh, yeah.  I got you, motherfucker.  Okay, all right, I got it.  So, she does this while he's sleeping and then wakes him up by screaming.  Okay.  I'm tired of your lies, Slabby said O'Toole screamed at him.  The veins were popping out of her neck.  Stuck without a ride home, Slabby said he walked a mile to a convenience store to call 911.  Imagine walking with your ass glued shut and your dick glued to your belly. 
[02:24:30]  I'm guessing you go down a notch on your belt buckle when you're going to put that down.  Yeah, definitely.  What is up with this?  He then had to wait four hours at a local hospital before medical personnel could put his penis back in its proper position.  Do you think he had to flip out?  You're like, I'm fucking stabbed.  Here he can be walking up.  My dick is glued to my stomach.  Yeah.  They got a priority thing that they do in the emergency room.  In triage, I don't believe that's high on the priority list, your dick being glued to your stomach. 
[02:25:00]  I think the gunshots, the stabbings, the medical distress.  And while you're waiting, you do kind of like start small talk like, what are you doing here?  And, ah, I got the flu.  Ah, my son sprained his ankle.  Do you confess as you're sitting there?  Ah, my dick is glued to my belly.  My nuts are glued to my legs and my asshole's glued shut.  I still haven't been able to take a morning piss.  Yeah.  I got to take a morning piss and forget about having a cup of coffee or something because if I got to take a shit,  God knows what it would come out like if your asshole is glued shut. 
[02:25:30]  I'm not buying this, but we'll see.  It's a sprinkler.  Les claims to be juror on sack glue case.  Les.  No.  Hey, what's up?  Are you really a juror?  Yeah, juror number 10.  Number 10.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  They already picked you?  What's that?  They already picked the jury for this one.  That was kind of quick.  That was quick.  All right.  It was a two-and-a-half-day trial.  All right.  And they said we ended up giving him, Slabby, $46,200. 
[02:26:00]  That was the settlement on it.  I don't get it.  He was looking for $30,000.  No, there was, I think, three counts that we were allowed to award on, and each one was up to $30,000.  Are you from the future?  Because the case hasn't been decided yet.  No, you're wrong.  You can research it.  It's already been done.  I'm from West Portland County.  This is the other story.  Just write Slabby, S-L-A-B-Y, and glued penis. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, and her name was Yellow Tool.  I'm kind of buying this.  I think this guy is...  He's got a lot of confidence in this life.  Yeah, he does have a lot of confidence.  Is the story over or what?  Yes, it's finished.  We finished up Friday.  Yeah?  About 4.30 in the afternoon, we finished up.  Oh, it just ended.  All right, we're going to do our own research to see if you're telling the truth, sir.  Testified, ex-lover.  Okay, it was the court case. 
[02:27:00]  Bum, bum, bum.  Bum, bum, bum.  Yeah, we got to see all the pictures.  It was quite interesting.  And our jury room got, let's say, disciplined a couple times from making too much noise in  the jury room, laughing a little too much.  I was going to say, was there a lot of snickering?  I hope you guys were laughing.  Was anybody in there going...  Even in trial.  And you know what?  I had to do that jury duty last summer.  And I did everything I could to get out of it, just like everybody else.  But if I know it's one of these cases, oh my God. 
[02:27:30]  I'm going to have all the right answers.  Make sure I'm on the case.  What did he do that she glued his dick there?  Well, to try to make it as short as possible.  They were dating.  She broke up with him because he basically wasn't taking the relationship far enough.  So he starts seeing somebody else.  And then she calls and decides she wants him back.  And he's already dating somebody else.  So he tells her no.  And she keeps calling him and calling him.  Then he finally breaks up with this other woman. 
[02:28:00]  Gets back with Gail O'Toole.  And I think everything was fine for a while, according to their testimony.  And then one day they're sitting around the house.  And they were laying out in the sun.  And she brings up a conversation about the other woman wanting to know about her.  Wanting to know what she was like and how she was.  You know, basically comparing herself how old she was.  So it got out of hand and he wanted to leave.  So she calmed down.  And they were going to watch a movie at 9 o'clock at night. 
[02:28:30]  So they decided to take a nap prior to that.  And since she had calmed down, he decided to go ahead and stay.  And when he went for his nap, she got up out of bed and poured nail polish through his hair.  What a bitch.  And she wrote cute ass in nail polish on his ass cheeks while he was there.  And then dumped the super glue all over him.  Did it come up in court?  Like, why did this guy sleep so deeply?  Well, the reason they gave for that is because they were out the night before. 
[02:29:00]  And they said they didn't get home until like 4 in the morning.  And they were back up early the next morning to get some stuff done.  So they were tired.  No, they said they were only drinking soda the day that this happened.  Yeah, it looks like this guy's legit.  It says, O'Toole said the glue and the nail polish were part of a consensual sex act,  one that has her stuck paying $46,200 in damages.  Oh, how about that?  And you saw pictures of his dick glued to himself?  Yeah, from the police station and from the hospital. 
[02:29:30]  He had nice glossy photos around.  How far up his belly was his dick glued?  It was like if you were laying flat on your back and it was just laying there like kind of off to the side  but still laying up towards your belly button, that's how it was glued.  She didn't pull it all tight so he'd have to walk hunched over?  That would have been funny.  No, I think she just, the way he was sleeping, she I think just squeezed the bottle out  and wherever it ran, it kind of ran until it dried.  And his asshole being glued shut, was it just the cheeks or did she actually like put it in his anus? 
[02:30:00]  No, it just, like I said, she just dumped it over and where the crevices that it ran through, it ran through.  It ended up being his ass was glued.  Oh, what a bitch.  And then they said he went to the hospital, they said they tried to put mineral water on it  to try to get the glue off but that didn't work so they just had to peel everything off.  Oh, wow.  Did they just do it quick or did they... 
[02:30:30]  That's like ripping off an old Band-Aid on a hairy arm, you just got to go with it.  What'd they do first?  One, two, three.  What'd they do first, the dick or his ass?  They didn't say that, all they know is he had to get salved for afterwards.  Salved.  I imagine he lost a few layers of skin.  Yeah.  Some pubic hair stuck to it still.  Salved.  One of the worst words ever invented.  Salved.  Salved.  The L in it really makes it scary. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Salved.  I would have said do the dick first.  Yeah.  Just get it over with.  Do the dick.  All right.  Just make sure that's all fine and well.  Well, thanks, Les.  He's screaming like Sylvester Stallone.  Hey, no problem, guys.  During number 10, listening to the show.  I like that.  We do like that.  I'm out.  All right, Les.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  We've got to get Steven here because he spent a lot of the morning cutting up the latest  George Carlin special.  Oh, right.  Oh, I taped that.  It wasn't any good.  I heard a little bit of it in the office. 
[02:31:30]  He's not a fan.  Eh.  Not a fan of the Carlin.  I think he's still doing it.  I'm a fan of the old Carlin.  I think George Carlin is still relevant.  No.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  You're lying.  I think he's still relevant.  You're lying.  You're lying.  Opie's lying.  I went and saw him a couple years ago, a film one of his HBO specials, and it was great.  I'm not digging on him anymore.  Used to be cool.  Used to be relevant.  Used to be cutting edge.  Now, all he does, here's what he does.  He gets up on stage and starts rattling things off, and it's more how quickly can I just babble 
[02:32:00]  shit out, and then not one laugh during the time he's speaking.  Then when he finishes babbling and babbling, he gets an applause break, and then he's back  to babbling again, trying to rhyme almost like he's rapping.  It's almost like a George Carlin rap.  Not funny.  I think you're right, but I think if his, uh, what an asshole, Derek.  Come on.  If the stuff he was talking about wasn't, uh, that was Travis that time. 
[02:32:30]  If the stuff he was talking about was completely irrelevant, I think you'd have a point, but  he's got, he's actually trying to, uh...  It's, unfortunately, look, I don't know how into popular culture he is at this stage in  his life, but it almost sounds forced.  That's Terry Garr?  When he makes, um...  Yeah, she's a wreck.  Holy sh...  That's Terry Garr?  Oh, my God.  Al Roker's...  Wasn't she cute in, like, that episode of Star Trek?  We have a lot of TVs in the studio.  She was in Mr. Mom.  No, that's what, that's what you look like if you don't do any work. 
[02:33:00]  That's what, uh, Goldie Hawn should look like.  Ha, ha, ha.  Seriously.  That is not Terry Garr.  Good for her.  That's like...  She's 53 and she looks like it.  Wow, what happened?  That's her?  You can't even tell it's her.  She was even kind of cute in Close Encounters.  It looks like she has, like, fat makeup on for a role she's playing.  She's gonna be in the Nutty Professor for Part 3.  You know, she was, uh, she was supposed to be like Goldie Hawn a little back in those  days, the wacky, goofy kind of ditzy blonde. 
[02:33:30]  And, um...  Wow.  That's her?  I mean, uh...  She's gotta be on some kind of medication that puffs her up.  Oh, she's got the, uh...  Maybe she's on the Jerry Lewis drug.  Maybe.  What was going on in the country at the time.  And then, one of your biggest challenges, obviously, you know, for years you were suffering  with pain and then you were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  Oh!  Oh, baby!  What went through your mind when you finally got the diagnosis? 
[02:34:00]  Well, you know, when I finally got the diagnosis, I was, at last, uh, happy to know what maybe  there was something we could put a name to this.  But, um...  Oh, Jesus.  I had symptoms for many...  Wow.  That time is a bitch.  I gotta tell you.  No one escapes time.  No one.  That time stinks.  That time stinks.  Tick.  Tuck.  There was a, there was a, uh, there was a time she was considered sexy.  Kind of like a second step.  She was fucking hot, yeah.  She used to do those Letterman appearances and there was a little chemistry there.  A little, a little, a little sexual energy. 
[02:34:30]  Come on, a little dress there.  A little skirt.  And then she played in a lot of movies where she was, uh, very sexy.  Mm-hmm.  Whew.  Anyway, go ahead, Steve.  I, I understand what Aunt's saying.  I just think...  I'm sorry, God.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  He's still, you know, he's, he's, he does make you think.  He does come up with relevant, relevant material.  You think?  Like when he was, when he's talking about the internet, even.  It sounds like an old guy trying to reference the internet.  Like, I, I, I'm sorry.  He's just, there's nothing he could do. 
[02:35:00]  Tick, tock, tick, tock.  He's not a kid anymore.  No, I understand.  I love him.  People tend to not be able to reference, uh, things that are current very well.  I, I think, there's a part of him that's still stuck in the 70s, I think.  But still, he, he, he does come up with relevant material.  And, and in addition to that two minute monologue that he comes up with in the beginning, or  three minute monologue that he does in the beginning of his HBO special, which I agree  does sound forced because it's like beat poetry almost.  Yeah, exactly.  Ugh.  Which is not a relevant art form, I think, anymore. 
[02:35:30]  Would it beat poetry go away 20 years ago?  30 years ago?  I don't know.  I think he's still brilliant.  I don't care if George Carlin beat poet.  He got fired at MGM.  The MGM grant.  He got fired.  Oh, yeah.  He went out there.  The guy's like pushing 70, and he's selling tickets, and he still gets fired.  Yeah, I think he's still brilliant.  He went out there and just bashed the place.  Bashed the management.  What kind of a fucking idiot would actually come to Las Vegas?  Yeah.  I would have loved to have been sitting there.  Bash White City, bash the people in the audience for being there. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, I just don't think he wanted the gig.  Let me go to David for one second.  David.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Good morning.  Hi.  Take it fast, bro.  We're in a flow here, I think.  You got it.  I think we got something going on.  I'm calling you with a little heads up here.  I just got my new subscription of FHM Magazine.  Yeah.  It has a beautiful insert for XM Satellite Radio, and you guys are displayed very, very nicely  in the middle of it.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, they're doing that in all the hot magazines this month.  That's great.  Awesome.  You're a sandwich between Franklin and Tyra.  FHM.  All right. 
[02:36:30]  I know.  That's the same pullout they had in Us Weekly, or Us Magazine, or whatever it's called.  They're taking care of you guys.  Thank you, David.  I appreciate that.  You got it.  Yeah.  Terry Garr and Young Frankenstein.  Yeah.  Very, very hot.  There you go.  Yeah.  So, why don't we play the Carlin, then?  Life is Worth Losing?  Life is Worth Losing was the HBO special.  You want to play the first bit?  Yeah.  You should have it right there.  Hey, is that Naked Terry Garr?  Yeah, man.  What movie is that from?  That's from One from the Heart, 1982. 
[02:37:00]  82?  All right.  No.  Give me any crickets.  All right.  As we go to break, some George Carlin from his HBO special.  Oh, we're not going to comment on it?  Oh, you want to?  Yeah.  I don't want him to get away with this shit.  Like it's just fucking playing a comic.  By the way, we're going to start podcasting.  Accepting podcasts on this show.  What?  Listening to podcasts.  We're going to have people send in their podcasts.  Oh, great. 
[02:37:30]  Who are they emailing those to?  Steve.  I've got to communique from Elo.  It's a whole thing he wants to try.  Okay.  Podcasting.  We've got to set up a system.  Okay.  And people are going to do like a show.  And then?  Yeah, it's got to be like three or four minutes long, though.  Really short.  Uh-huh.  And then we'll do something with them.  Maybe we'll do something on the weekend or something.  We've got to start jazzing up the weekends on this channel.  We really do.  You want to play jazz on the weekends?  Why?  Well, that would be nice, too.  And we're also having the listeners vote for their favorite bits since we're... 
[02:38:00]  since being at XM.  We're going to have an end-of-year special.  Oh, how about that?  That's going to be very, very involved, hopefully.  All right.  So you want to comment about this?  Yeah, leave the mics on.  I just want to hear.  All right.  I'm a modern man, a man for the millennium.  Digital and smoke-free.  A diversified, multicultural...  What happened?  A post-modern deconstructionist.  You know...  CD one or two?  If this CD player is still in here tomorrow, it won't be in here anymore. 
[02:38:30]  Okay.  Are you saying that you're going to rip it out and break it, Opie?  Because I couldn't believe that.  I've never seen you do anything like that.  Well...  I wouldn't take it as a real threat, anybody listening to me.  Now it's interrupting our show.  It's happened three or four times.  We said that there's something wrong with this CD player.  Is it the CD that you guys recorded?  What do you like?  Better not.  No.  Opie, you wouldn't do something like that.  Come on.  Oh, shit.  Opie, put it down.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  In the office.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  He's ripping it. 
[02:39:00]  Well, now it's got to be fixed, because now the tray doesn't close.  So now we can't use it.  Now we can't be confused and use it by which one works and which one doesn't.  Because, look, now it doesn't work at all.  Now it doesn't work.  See?  See, now we won't be confused anymore, and it won't interrupt the flow of our radio.  Yeah.  See, that's what we do.  See?  Were you supposed to pull it like that?  I heard something crack.  I'm a modern man, a man for the millennium.  Digital and smoke-free.  A diversified, multicultural, post-modern deconstructionist, politically, anatomically, and ecologically incorrect.  I've been uplinked and downloaded. 
[02:39:30]  I've been inputted and outsourced.  I know the upside of downsizing.  I know the downside of upgrading.  I'm a high-tech, low-life, a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, bi-coastal multitasker, and I can give you a gigabyte in a nanosecond.  All right.  And then they just applaud that it was that.  No, but that's always been his style, though.  It really has.  You know, Carlin also memorizes pages and pages and pages of monologues.  That hasn't always been his style.  You're not helping George Carlin.  I think he's brilliant, but to say that he's a good, he's good at mesmerizing. 
[02:40:00]  That he's good at memorizing, it's not going to help the argument that Anthony's bringing up here.  I can understand that's his style, that whole flow thing.  But usually, it's funny.  Like, that's not funny.  He's just standing there.  He's babbling.  Just how many words can I fucking string together and throw out there?  And then people applaud for the fact that, wow, he did it without really stuttering or tripping up. 
[02:40:30]  It wasn't funny, but I'm kind of impressed that his tongue and teeth work together so well.  All right.  Let's take a little more.  I'm sorry.  I'm not taking it.  I'm new wave, but I'm old school, and my inner child is outward bound.  I'm a hot-wired, heat-seeking, warm-hearted, cool customer, voice-activated and biodegradable.  I interface in my database.  My database is in cyberspace, so I'm interactive, I'm hyperactive, and from time to time, I'm radioactive.  He's using, like, old terminology.  I'm sorry. 
[02:41:00]  I just can't rip it.  Of course you're a comic.  You can't.  No, I've seen guys who are just dated in their 35.  What's up with the Gulf War?  I mean, the first one.  Remember that?  This guy's, like, pushing 70, and it's like, I don't know.  You didn't like his last special where he was telling people that their kids weren't special and that there's no God?  No, that's good.  He's watching people freaking out.  I like that shit.  I thought he was extremely bitter.  He was dead, extremely bitter in his last special, which is fine, you know. 
[02:41:30]  He did get very angry for a while.  Yeah, he was, like, really pissed.  Well, because he's got a new lady.  Oh, does he?  Yeah, his first wife.  There was a really good interview in Rolling Stone magazine, and he's got a very young lady right now, and he's very, very happy.  If I, like, paid to see George Carlin, I'm not, like, going out to see a lot of comics in my life.  I just know about Carlin.  And, you know, I don't know everything about him, but I pay good money to see him.  And I sit down, and I get, like, this kind of thing. 
[02:42:00]  I'm going to be pissed.  I'm going to be sitting there going, it's not fucking funny.  Well, let's continue.  One, two, three more applause.  Behind the eight ball, ahead of the curve, riding the wave, dodging the bullet, pushing the envelope.  I'm on point, on task, on message, and off drugs.  I got no need for coke and speed.  I got no urge to binge and purge.  I'm in the moment, on the edge, over the top, but under the radar.  A high-concept, low-profile, medium-range ballistic missionary.  A streetwise smart bomb.  A top gun bottom feeder. 
[02:42:30]  I wear power ties, I tell power lies, I take power naps, I run victory laps.  I'm a totally ongoing Bigfoot slam-dunk rainmaker with a proactive outreach.  A raging workaholic.  A working rageaholic.  Out of rehab and in denial.  Oh, and then he goes in.  That guy.  He's ripping off Nipsey Russell.  I got a personal trainer, a personal shop, or a personal assistant.  And then, see?  All right, he keeps going.  And then he keeps going.  All right, we'll save everybody.  What are you doing? 
[02:43:00]  No, no.  Because this makes my point.  This makes my point.  You know what?  I'm not even going to argue it anymore.  Okay.  I think you win.  I'm not.  I think it's...  This goes on and on.  I think it's pretty clever how he could, you know, throw all that together.  But that's not his whole...  Oh, were you just doing it?  Yeah, you just got his beginning back.  You know what?  If Hendrix lived, he'd be pretty clever throwing this together.  He'd be lighting a fucking accordion on fire at this point.  Look at this guy.  That's woodstock shit again.  But I don't listen to George Carlin because he could string all that crap together.  No, I mean, no.  I like when he gets into actual stuff. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  I can't really argue that.  I think Anthony's making a pretty good point there.  It's clever.  It's well thought out.  But enough.  He's going to throw it out for one little round.  You get the applause.  He's good at memorizing and all that.  But is it actually funny?  No.  It's clever.  Yeah.  And it's got almost like a beat to it.  I'm a lean, mean, fighting machine.  Ah, tell a joke.  I mean, he does.  Make cupcakes, toast, and some green beans.  That's only three minutes of an hour-long special. 
[02:44:00]  The rest of...  The first three.  Yeah, but then the next bit here, educational system and corporations own the U.S.  Right.  That's a typical Carlin, you know, bitter, you know, anti-establishment bitter rant.  All right.  All right.  I'm willing to open my mind.  Let's say hi to Mike on Long Island.  Mike?  Yeah.  Hey.  We saw George Carlin at Westbury last year.  Half the place walked out on him.  It was awful.  Why?  He was terrible.  Yeah.  He's probably working out the special. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  It was awful.  I mean, the guy was just not funny.  All right.  Thanks, Mike.  Let's say hi to Aaron.  Aaron?  Yeah.  Hey.  What's up?  What's up?  Well, I'm telling you, his last special sucked.  It was cynical.  It was morbid.  And he's usually, you know, hates humans, blah, blah, blah, loves disasters and whatnot.  But this time, this last special, he's gone off the deep end.  He's just shitty.  All right.  Thank you, Aaron.  Yeah.  Well said.  Let's say hi to Mike.  See, no, they're missing the...  That's why he's enjoyable. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, I like the black comedy.  No, it's just to listen to that reaction.  Then you go see him and you watch him be this guy.  He's just gone off the deep end.  But everything that guy just listed is exactly why people like Carlin.  Yeah.  It's because he's so morbid.  There's 75 to 100 people walked down on his show in Denver about a year ago.  Let's say hi to Ken in Pittsburgh.  Ken?  Hi, Owen.  Hi.  Hey, I saw Carlin, like, it must have been March last year.  And he was reading that poetry that he did on the HBO special.  So I've got to memorize this for the HBO special. 
[02:45:30]  And he was reading it.  Oh, he's reading it?  Yeah.  You guys in Pittsburgh should feel lucky that Carlin even came to your city.  Oh, he was great, other than that beginning.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  And aren't the kids not special?  You know, come on.  Bill Hicks.  Didn't he do that?  That whole thing?  Mm-hmm.  About how your kids aren't special?  Oh, yeah.  And then he's wiped a whole generation off his chest with a sock?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get into this other clip, and then we'll see where it goes. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  But if you talk to one of them about this, if you isolate one of them, you sit them down rationally,  you talk to them about the low IQs and the dumb behavior and the bad decisions, right away, they start talking about education.  That's the big answer to everything, education.  They say, we need more money for education.  We need more books, more teachers, more classrooms, more schools.  We need more testing for the kids.  You say to them, well, you know, we've tried all of that, and the kids still can't pass the test.  They say, oh, don't you worry about that.  We're going to lower the passing grades.  And that's what they do in a lot of these schools now.  They lower the passing grades so more kids can pass. 
[02:46:30]  More kids pass.  The school looks good.  Everybody's happy.  The IQ of the country slips another two or three points.  And pretty soon, all you'll need to get into college is a fucking pencil.  Got a pencil?  Get the fuck in there.  It's physics.  Then everyone wonders why 17 other countries graduate more scientists than we do.  Education.  Politicians know that word.  They use it on you.  Politicians have traditionally hidden behind three things.  The flag, the Bible, and children.  No child left behind.  No child left behind. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, really?  Well, it wasn't long ago you were talking about giving kids a head start.  Head start, left behind.  Someone's losing fucking ground here.  But there's a reason.  There's a reason.  There's a reason for this.  There's a reason education sucks.  And it's the same reason that it will never, ever, ever be fixed.  It's never going to get any better.  Don't look for it.  Be happy with what you got.  Because the owners of this country don't want that.  I'm talking about the real owners now.  The big, wealthy, man. 
[02:47:30]  The real owners.  The big, wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.  Forget the politicians.  They're irrelevant.  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.  You don't.  You have no choice.  You have owners.  They own you.  They own everything.  They own all the important land.  They own and control the corporations.  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls.  They've got the judges in their back pockets. 
[02:48:00]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.  They got you by the balls.  They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying to get what they want.  Well, we know what they want.  There's really no set-up page anymore.  That's true.  I mean, what he's saying, you know, but this sounds, you could sit smoking a joint with any aged hippie and hear this shit. 
[02:48:30]  That's, there's no jokes here.  It's just him fucking babbling about the government and that's not the George Carlin of old.  I'm sorry, it's old George Carlin.  It's his views on education and corporations in America.  Great.  Do it in a comedic style.  Don't just tell me, hey, there's politicians out there and what they're doing is, and he thinks because he's doing it in this, like, kind of flow that it's any better than just being lectured. 
[02:49:00]  That's a fucking lecture you went to.  You paid to see George Carlin lecture you on fucking politics.  And I got to tell you, I knew we were going to do this today and I thought you and I would have a lively discussion and I knew Bill wouldn't say anything  because it's about a comedian and, and you know how, God forbid, courageous comics are.  Talking about a lot of comics.  That paved the way.  God forbid.  But I got to tell you, I think I see it your way now.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I really do.  Well, thank you.  I like, I don't know.  You think Carlin's a bitter old man? 
[02:49:30]  You think Carlin's a bitter old man?  Who the fuck am I to trash George Carlin?  You're not the only guy.  What are you hearing?  Use your own mind, man.  Okay, okay, so his 98th HBO special maybe fucking missed the mark a little bit.  I mean, what the fuck do you want from me here?  But Anthony and I have been at this a long time.  We just noticed when comedians come in and we start a lively discussion about comics, you guys will just not say a word.  Yep.  Why?  What do you mean, well, first of all, you're talking George Carlin.  And I'm not attacking you.  You're not just bringing up some jackass. 
[02:50:00]  No, we've done this with Robin Williams.  Joe Rogan came in here and trashed everybody.  But the thing about it, he was trashing guys.  It's like he's trashing Carlos Mencia.  I don't know the fucking guy.  You know?  No, we're not.  All right, you can say George.  Hold on.  What the fuck?  And then you guys end up having him in here the next week and you're talking to him.  That's what makes it fun.  And you never brought this shit up to him, did you?  Yeah, we did.  Oh, yeah.  That's not what I heard.  I'm just out on a limb right now.  We played the clips.  We played the clips.  I didn't hear that.  This is what I want to say. 
[02:50:30]  This is what I want to say.  George Carlin, I think, is a very funny guy.  I got the box set and I buy a lot of the stuff that he puts out, okay?  So I'm not questioning if he's talented, if he's had a great career.  Of course, he's on HBO every year, every two years.  Yeah, he's done some great things.  Things we'll never do in our career.  Absolutely.  Okay, you want to know what I'm saying is, what do you think of this right now, what  we're playing?  What do I think about that?  I mean, yeah, I think you guys are right.  It's like he's more like preaching at this point.  And yeah, I mean, he probably could use some jokes in there. 
[02:51:00]  But I mean, who the fuck am I to criticize the guy?  Just a person that's hearing something.  There's a mechanic in Columbus, Ohio that's criticizing him right now.  Exactly.  I don't think I'm anybody.  I can't play guitar and I'll rip Nickelback and I'll say they suck, right?  You have to be qualified to criticize him?  Yeah, I'm not anybody that can criticize him.  So all of a sudden, once you're doing it, once you're doing it, it makes a different  person.  And then you pick like the fucking living legend.  And I'm supposed to fucking trash him?  No. 
[02:51:30]  No.  We're just trying to be honest, though.  I've never trashed Ellen DeGeneres.  I like Ellen.  I hate to say it, but I like her.  Ellen is a genius.  Horrendous.  She looks like she signed the Constitution.  I like her comedy.  Oh, is that much?  I like her comedy.  Ah, it's George Carlin calling it up.  That's my dad.  Let's listen to more George here.  Let's listen to him.  Know what they want.  They want more for themselves and less for everybody else.  You know what I mean?  You don't go pick on your fucking grandfather in a goddamn nursing home.  What the fuck?  Look how he walks now.  I mean, Jesus Christ. 
[02:52:00]  Give the guy a fucking break.  He's like 70 years old.  But he's not doing this.  He's still up there doing it.  But he's not doing this acting at an old age home.  He's doing it on HBO.  But he's also been bitter old George Carlin now for the better part of 10 years.  Maybe I should have prefaced this.  Dude, did you see that AIDS bit he did?  He did a fucking bit about AIDS in the early 90s when he was like fucking 93.  He's 69 right now, so he's not even that old.  Maybe I should have prefaced it a little better.  That, yes, the guy's had a great career.  He's been funny.  Recently, he's been funny. 
[02:52:30]  We've had him on our show.  He stunk.  And he wasn't very funny.  But it was just great to have him on.  It was great to have him on.  And I wouldn't sit there and bash him.  There wasn't a way that George Carlin was sitting in on our show one day.  The guy's got credentials.  The guy can, this shit, fine.  His career makes this just, it bowls it over.  It doesn't matter.  I'm just saying, as I'm putting myself in the position of a paying customer going to  this gig and watching it, I would be really disappointed in seeing George Carlin like 
[02:53:00]  this.  That's all.  Like you said, you'd be disappointed.  You know, Jimi Hendrix right now would probably blow.  But you're seeing Hendrix and you get people going, fucking Hendrix.  But you'd be like, eh, yeah.  It's not Hendrix.  Hey, be fat now.  Yeah.  Well, we know what they want.  They want more for themselves and less for everybody else.  But I'll tell you what they don't want.  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. 
[02:53:30]  They're not interested in that.  That doesn't help them.  You know what this is like?  Thank you, Professor Carlin.  It would be like making fun of ACDC.  I grew up, I loved them.  You mean you're going to tell me they haven't been writing the same fucking song for the  last 30 years?  Yeah.  They got like two topics that they write about.  I still love them.  They still rock and sound great, though.  But it's still verse, chorus, verse.  You could take them in 2005, take them in 95, take them in 85, and it's very comparable.  Angus having been doing the exact same bit, the way he moons the crowd. 
[02:54:00]  That's true.  And then Brian Johnson puts them up on his 92-year-old shoulders.  I mean, see, now you've got me trashing a band I actually love, but it's just like...  You like it, guys.  Come on.  Let's get to the end of this George Carlin thing.  You're not going to be hip when you're 70.  I mean, that's not really groundbreaking.  But he's on HBO.  That's what we're saying.  Why does he get another HBO special?  Maybe a younger comic.  All right.  You want to pick a guy?  Robert Klein. 
[02:54:30]  But there's younger...  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  There is a guy that just lost any touch of relevance relating to an audience.  All right.  Want me to trash a guy?  I'll trash him.  He stunk the first time I saw him, and he fucking...  He stunk every...  You don't think he was kind of relevant, kind of hip back in the olden days?  Oh, when he wore his sweater on his first fucking special?  No, I didn't.  You're not brave.  What do you mean I'm not brave?  Robert Klein can't do anything to you.  That's why you're attacking him.  What is George Carlin going to do? 
[02:55:00]  Have me open for him in fucking Vegas?  You can see that George Carlin has that old man strength, and I think you're scared of it.  Old man strength.  Listen, Opie, I've been around Patrice long enough to know when I'm being baited.  Okay?  You're going to have to do a lot better than that.  I'll accept that challenge, my friend.  Give me time.  All right.  Let's do the last bit of Carlin.  I'm really trying to think of a fucking legend in radio that I can bring up.  That's against their interest.  That's right. 
[02:55:30]  You know something?  They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table to figure out how badly they're getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago.  They don't want that.  You know what they want?  They want obedient workers.  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasing machines.  What's Russia?  You know, I know America's got a few problems in the machine, but man, Carlin, it's making it sound like the Soviet Union of the 50s and 60s. 
[02:56:00]  I don't know what I think about that argument about we don't want an intelligent society.  I'm not really sure.  There's so much information available to human beings out there, regardless of what the government-controlled media man, like he's trying to put across.  Media man.  I think he's talking about the big networks and the obviously corporate control.  Anyone who gets all of their information from television or just the newspaper or just it is a fucking idiot. 
[02:56:30]  But I think that's what he's talking about right there.  But like there aren't options.  Like only George is finding the options.  The problem is you have to have like a setup and a punch in there.  Please.  That's what you need.  Please, I'm looking.  I'm pleased.  But he makes a good point.  There's not a joke in here to be had.  Yeah, they're great points.  You can hear it at a lecture at a college.  Bill Hicks is one of my favorites.  When he was doing all this political ranting and raving and stuff. 
[02:57:00]  And you were laughing.  You were like Bill Hicks.  Not a big Bill Hicks fan, were you?  No.  But at least he made jokes out of this stuff.  Because he can't do anything for him because he's dead.  Oh, wow.  No, no.  I didn't say that.  Real brave, Bill.  I didn't say that I wasn't a fan of Bill Hicks.  Real brave.  I see the pattern here.  That's not what I was saying.  That's not what I was saying at all.  You did challenge me, though.  You know, fucking Henry Gibson was doing this poetry back on Laughing.  That's right. 
[02:57:30]  Norm Crosby.  Did you guys say this shit to him when he showed up?  No.  Exactly.  I'm not saying I'm not a fucking two-faced fag when these people come onto the show.  I am absolutely a pussy.  So what are you calling me?  You're calling me that right now because I won't trash the guy because he's not here?  At least admit to it when it's safe.  Nipsey Russell.  You know what?  When you buy some clothes that actually have a fucking label on it somewhere that I recognize,  then I'll give you shit.  Wow, did you jump.  Yeah, why are you making fun of our clothes today? 
[02:58:00]  Because you're attacking me and I'm fucking latching back.  Nipsey Russell.  Nipsey Russell.  What is that?  Thumbs up or thumbs down?  I don't know what it is.  What is this?  What is it?  I can't do radio with you anymore.  What kind of shirt is it?  Van Heusen.  I have a Van Heusen shirt.  You've never heard of Van Heusen, my friend?  Why the fuck do you have a Van Heusen shirt?  I'm with Bill now.  And why are my clothes now in this shirt?  First of all, that is the first sign of somebody that has no point left. 
[02:58:30]  That IZOD style shirt should only be like a short sleeve.  Here's a long sleeve I got.  It's chilly out.  That's a fucking alligator.  That's the type of shirt, yeah, that should have some kind of animal symbol on it.  I'm with Bill.  You are grasping.  That was on a mannequin at Sears.  Right next to their awful golf equipment.  And their Voight football with a titanium head.  You have just vindicated me.  When you have to jump to my shirt to bail out of the Carlin disguise, 
[02:59:00]  You know why?  Because I don't know any fucking legends in radio.  Don Imus is a legend.  That I could fucking bring up.  Yeah, and you guys always go,  Don's great, he wears our shirt, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You guys kiss his ass every time I'm fucking in here.  The second he turned on us, it would be all over for Don.  George Carlin never turned on me.  I'll tell you what's great about Don Imus if you want to listen.  My good friend Don Imus that I called Friday and he didn't call me back.  Uh-oh.  He's up there.  He's in his 60s and he's still doing great radio. 
[02:59:30]  And he's not the same guy he was, you know, 15, 20 years ago.  But he's surrounding himself.  He has surrounded himself with some quality broadcasters that really keep that show going.  Yeah, well, you can't do that in stand-up.  And he's a great leader that still gets the job done.  Definitely.  Now back to Anthony's shirt.  What did I do?  Is that your TV shirt?  It's a Van Heusen.  Are you wearing a TV shirt?  I thought we were doing some TV today, so I figured I'd wear something that wasn't so slovenly. 
[03:00:00]  But at least I just wore mine, Opie.  I didn't bring it on a fucking hanger like you did.  My TV shirt's over there.  Where's your TV shirt?  It's hanging.  Look, it's hanging.  Yeah, but we're in the trenches.  And let's see what the brand name is on that one.  You know what?  He's a professional.  Yeah?  You're a professional.  Dude, it's a Banana Republic.  You know what I could eat?  You know what your problem is, man?  MSNBC.  You do radio, man.  I know, man.  I'm going to say Van Heusen.  You've got to have a TV shirt.  I'm going to say Van Heusen faggier than Banana Republic. 
[03:00:30]  You are, but fuck that.  Banana Republic could be the faggiest attire ever made.  I don't go there a lot, but you can see it.  That is faggier.  That you go to the Banana Republic.  That's a fine shirt.  And their clothes suck.  I'm not doubting it.  I have two shirts from there, I think.  You know, that's about it.  Dude, you could have stopped it.  I have two shirts.  Yeah, well.  I don't take it as seriously as you.  How much money is he making?  He's still shot at the Banana Republic.  I don't care what I look like.  He cares with the Van Heusen.  I don't care.  It's comfortable to me. 
[03:01:00]  Van Heusen.  I'd rather wear something that's a little bit better made than just crap.  Fucking snob.  He really is.  Van Heusen.  Van Heusen.  What's that shirt you're wearing?  It's a corduroy button-up.  Right.  I was waiting for it to come back to my navy blue.  Where's the third fucking needlepoint shirt you had on the other?  Women like that shirt.  They respond to it.  Women like it.  They rub my chest.  Nipsey Russell, thumbs up, thumbs down.  Nipsey Russell.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  The guy, the only time I ever saw him was on game shows. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, game shows.  Horrendous.  Dean Martin roasts.  All right.  Horrendous.  Horrendous.  Horrendous.  I mean.  Here, let's let the George Carlin play out here.  To run the machines and do the paperwork.  Beating an old man on the show right now.  To passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer  hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears  the minute you go to collect it.  And now they're coming for your Social Security money.  They want your fucking retirement money.  They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street. 
[03:02:00]  And you know something?  They'll get it.  They'll get it all from you.  Sooner or later.  Because they own this fucking place.  It's a big club.  And you ain't in it.  You and I are not in the big club.  You and I.  George, now you've got to calm down.  George is in it.  George is in it.  George, you know you're in it.  Stop.  When the Democrats talk about taxing the rich.  He did lose a lot.  They want to tax the rich and all the tax cuts that Bush gave to the wealthy. 
[03:02:30]  You're in that club.  He lost a lot to the IRS, but I think he's back on top.  Making some fine money better.  You and I.  Now, George, you've got to calm down with the you and I.  And they're coming for the Social Security.  You're just going to show footage of like Paul Newman driving his race car next.  Look, we weren't doing anything.  He can't fucking make a left turn anymore.  But playing his audio.  And I started his audio.  All the brutal, horrendous fucking hacks out there that you could have fucking popped in some shit. 
[03:03:00]  You pick fucking George Carlin.  Because it's George Carlin.  And then expect me to pile on.  We're all about pop culture.  This is in the now.  This just happened, Bill.  This just happened.  There's a lot of things that happened.  And I didn't hear him on this program.  And Steve actually found two clips that he thought were interesting.  I thought they were interesting.  That was a four-minute clip.  There was not one joke in there.  No.  And you're going to see a comedy show.  That's the only problem I have with Carlin.  But it's not like Carlin just started doing that kind of material.  He's been doing it for years. 
[03:03:30]  But it always had a humor to it.  It had a twist like something funny.  I think he's, you know...  I like the thing where he talks about his stuff.  And how people have stuff.  You see that?  What?  I like the stuff, Joe.  I mean, that's like a guy.  He just can never hear Stairway to Heaven enough times.  No!  You're a hack.  I'm not a hack.  You are a hack.  I am just saying that that...  You are a hack.  You enjoy Carrot Top.  I used one example.  You go to Vegas and you watch Carrot Top.  No.  No.  And he pulls crazy shit out of a car.  Carrot Top will never feel for me.  And you sit there with a look of glee on your face like you're hooked up to a fucking... 
[03:04:00]  I hate the Carrot Top.  Hate Carrot Top.  But he's adorable when he's doing it.  He is not adorable.  I mentioned one bit that Carlin did of late and it's 20 years old.  Yeah, it's 20 years old.  Yeah, I'm into ACDC.  You shook me all night long.  That's a catchy tune.  George is...  You mainstream...  I'm sorry.  ...right out over the place.  Oh, I should just love this shit because it's Carlin. 
[03:04:30]  No, but you said I love George Carlin and you pick up the fucking hacky one.  Mr. Carlin was preaching.  Hacky, it had some laughs in it at least.  Jesus Christ.  Mr. Carlin was just preaching there.  That's all.  That was preaching.  So did hanging with Mr. Cooper.  That was fucking politics.  That was getting up there and just doing a political speech.  There you go.  I don't know how many times I have to agree with you that there could have been some more  punchlines.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Some more.  How about one?  I'm not going to sit here and trash George Carlin.  Guys, guys, we've got to take a break.  It would be a crime if... 
[03:05:00]  Don't trash Carlin, so turn to my shirt.  It would be a crime if this show ended without us going to paradise.  Can we all...  Now here's something we can all...  Can we all get together for paradise?  You know, no.  Why?  A poor, drunk, fucking blonde girl.  We're going to tear her apart like big, brave men.  I'm not going to be part of this.  I think Tara deserves a little more respect.  You know what he's being right now?  It's exploitation through editing.  He is being childish.  You're going to fucking compare Tara Reid to George Carlin?  I'm saying we shouldn't exploit the fact that they edit her to look stupid? 
[03:05:30]  No, what you're saying is what the fuck I just said about George is the same thing  as what you're saying about Tara.  You're mocking me right now, Anthony, and I don't appreciate it.  You're right.  We're getting together for paradise after the break, okay?  Okay.  And also, before we leave, we've got to do the Family Guy audio.  They did a whole show on the FCC, and it was quite brilliant.  Yes, they did.  I think they did the show for like 100 people in the business.  Yeah, it's all inside jokes.  It's very inside, but maybe we could help it along a little bit after the break, okay?  I think you just drove a wedge between the two of us.  I'm feeling a little tension.  I have no wedges. 
[03:06:00]  What are you kidding?  That's been my job for 10 years, sir.  A wedge.  Welcome to the program.  Welcome to the program.  I guess we should tell Aries we like to break things on this show.  It's fun.  Hey, man.  I was here for that.  Like, Voss has an invite from President Bush.  No, not invited.  What is it?  Let me see it again.  You're not going to see it again.  It's your wedding invitation.  Let me see it from here.  He sent an invitation to the President. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, give me the fucking thing.  Oh, shit.  Don't break that.  I'm telling you.  Wait, what happened?  What happened?  He took it out of his bed.  He took it out of my bed.  Oh, jeez.  Did someone rifle through your place?  Don't break it.  I'm telling you.  Why is it already a little askew?  Let me see that.  Give me the fucking thing.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you're kidding, you motherfucker.  I wasn't looking up.  That scared the shit out of me. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  I wasn't even looking up, man.  Holy shit.  I didn't realize it.  That's a real glass, you idiot.  You broke him.  You know how you think Ares pissed off at the last guy?  He just cut his face, you dummy.  It was like conflict.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm good.  I'm good.  You're not cut?  No, no.  I just scared the shit out of me.  You're not going to turn around back in your car?  No, not with him here.  Was that actually the fucking...  No, I...  It was glass.  Oh, you son of a bitch.  I switched it.  You broke your brain. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, but I didn't realize it was glass.  Holy shit.  Oh, you fucking...  Look at you.  Now you're on the...  Look at you.  That shit out of me.  It's flying glass.  What's going on with me in the chin?  Huh?  Oh, my God.  I know.  I fell on the cheek.  Did I catch you, Ares?  That was nice and nice.  No, you're a lunatic.  A fucking $500 frame.  I really...  I got a few cuts, man.  You got some shrapnel.  Oh, man.  Man, I thought he really did it.  He didn't break it.  What are you...  That was glass.  That was really...  No, here, here, here, here.  Here, here it is.  Oh. 
[03:08:00]  What's that one?  Oh, that's the real one.  Wow.  Wait, you still didn't know that I broke a fake one?  What are you doing?  How stupid can you bet?  You were staring at it.  How stupid can it evolve?  Your fucking inches are.  They put it in real glass.  We did the switch.  He's looking at the...  He grabbed the...  Oh, I was just...  Because I was in shock.  Oh, all right.  No, we did the switcheroo.  That was actually a genius...  Wow, that really was a good boy.  You should have just gave us that one.  A little bait and switch.  That was a good bait.  But he still thought I really did it.  Yeah, I know.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[03:08:30]  I'm Bill Burr in studio. 
[03:09:00]  I wish we could do at least another hour of radio today because we've just touched the  surface.  Yeah.  I think we're having a good show because we all just looked up at the clock and said,  oh my God, it's 10.20 already?  I couldn't believe it.  How did that happen?  It's 20 past the hour for the national audience.  Let's get right into Paradise.  We saved this because Bill hasn't been around in a while.  We had Norton back and then, I don't know, you've been doing your own thing, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  We love the Paradise.  I've been going to places like Albany and Buffalo.  I don't got time for you guys.  Excited places.  I'm jet-setting.  It's all the hot cities in Wengland. 
[03:09:30]  Portland, Maine.  Yeah, much more important than getting national exposure on this show.  Exactly.  Why would I want to become a draw nationally when I can perform in front of 30 people in  Ottawa?  Ottawa.  Did you play Ottawa?  No.  Even that one was too fucking ridiculous.  Guys, we've got to get right into Paradise because we're losing time here.  Paradise has been canceled, but I guess they're pumping out the last few episodes.  Why the fuck would they cancel the show?  All those wild-ons were kind of cool at first because you get to see a lot of hot asses 
[03:10:00]  and stuff, but then it's like, all right, it's more of the same, whatever.  Plus, you've got to watch your career flame out.  Right.  But this stuff is cool.  I love Trainwreck TV.  They need more Trainwreck TV.  They're not ready to commit to Trainwreck TV, by the way.  They flirt with it here and there, like the Danny Bonaduce show and stuff, but that  had to be done with a therapist and rehab and stuff.  It can't just be...  They can't just totally commit to Trainwreck TV and allow this to happen in front of your  eyes.  We're getting there, you know, with the Paradise thing. 
[03:10:30]  And now that Bonaduce's kind of cleaned up, I don't want to watch it.  Yeah, you want to see him self-destruct.  I don't know what happened to the last episode.  I thought that was going to be on last night.  He was in rehab.  His wife visited, and they weren't sure if they were going to continue with their  relationship.  I actually watched the Peter Brady one.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  My Fair Brady.  Oh, my God.  How corny was that?  It fucking went on for fucking ever.  The end of My Fair Brady?  Yeah.  He's absolutely insane.  Christopher Knight actually proposed to...  He did.  ...that hot piece of...  But I didn't think he was going to do it. 
[03:11:00]  I thought it was like that Joe Pesci scene when he comes walking and thinks he's going  to get made, and he's like, ah, fuck.  Ah.  They made it look like he was actually giving her an apartment, meaning you need to move  on with your life and have a life of your own.  But then she's losing her mind, like, this is not what I want.  This is not what I want.  And then he goes down on his knee and...  But how much shit was Peter Brady saying that he could totally relate to?  I totally understood what he was fucking going through.  It's like, I don't want to break up with you.  I want to just stay in this fucking moment.  And let's not move on to fucking marriage and all that other horseshit. 
[03:11:30]  We got a little taste, you know, because they were in here.  That is a disaster in the making, that whole relationship.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  It might be good for another year or two, but that...  There's just...  Fuck that.  He's 50.  That's the hottest piece he's going to get.  Well, that's the problem.  Bang her.  Give her half your shit.  She just...  Tell the story at the bar.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck it.  She was a lesbian pretty much until she met him.  There's, like, all sorts of baggage there.  Great.  So when you get tired of hitting it, then you bring the third party in. 
[03:12:00]  I think when he falls because of this, it's going to be a long, hard fall.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We got to get into Tara Dice.  Great way to fall.  So that...  But I did see that last night.  I got rooked into that hour-long freaking season finale.  Peter Brady is older than Carlin.  A lot of people don't know that.  70, 47.  Yeah.  He just doesn't dye his hair.  All right.  Tara Dice.  Yeah.  This show was great.  We loved it.  Yeah.  They sent Tara around to different places around the world for her to party.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, guys. 
[03:12:30]  You guys.  And she would comment on various little tidbits of information about the place she was at.  Yeah.  History can just come out of her ass.  You know, she's in Greece.  She'll talk about, you know, Greek history.  Yeah.  People doing something exciting.  She'll say that she's going to do it the whole episode.  And then in the end, we'll be like...  Yeah.  It's crazy.  I was watching an episode and just laughing, thinking about you saying that because she was doing that.  And she's like, we're going to go surfing. 
[03:13:00]  It's going to be so kick-ass.  We're just going to head down to the beach.  And there's some, like, big waves.  I was just like big waves.  I think I like the big boys.  We're all going to get surfing down.  And they get to the beach.  And it's like, okay, well, let's get out there.  And it's like, are you crazy?  I'm not getting out there.  There's no way I'm surfing.  I'll just watch.  I'll sit here on the beach.  The guy almost died.  That guy is, like, so hot.  The best one was when she was windsurfing on the sand.  Yeah, yeah.  And then saying how great it was and how much fun it was.  Yeah, when they train people.  She's going, whoa. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  When they train people to windsurf, the first thing you do.  I almost fell off the earth.  Yeah.  How do you windsurf on the sand and it's actually fun?  The first thing they do is put you on the sand when you windsurf.  And it's just to learn how to pick the sail up and how to kind of stand on the board.  Yeah.  And that's the furthest she would go.  And she thought that was so much fun.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's so much fun.  We're here windsurfing on the sand.  So she was in a place I like to call St. Tropez.  St. Tropez. 
[03:14:00]  How do you really say it?  San Tropez.  San Tropez.  That's right.  San Tropez.  I like St. Tropez myself.  St. Tropez.  So this is Paradise.  Show's going away, unfortunately.  Bye-bye.  This could be the last time we do Paradise.  Life is a dream.  Here it is.  Paradise.  Imagine having a great dream.  Having the best dream in your life.  And all your friends are in your dream.  And guess what?  It's not a dream.  It's real.  Biggest show ever in the history of television. 
[03:14:30]  Like that should have been such a dramatic build up.  That almost sounded like the first time she was reading the copy.  Picture of Jay.  I apologize for that.  I apologize for that.  It's not actually happening.  Okay, Tara.  I think we got it.  Thank you.  That's a good one.  We're going to use that take.  We'll just put some slamming music behind it.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  This is Jay.  Picture Jay.  Picture.  It's great, Jay. 
[03:15:00]  You're here and it's just happening.  And all your friends are up.  And cut.  Tara's invention idea.  Listen to this.  Listen, I came up with an idea.  And it's honestly the biggest idea I've ever come up with.  What is it?  I want at least 50% because it's my idea.  Or yours.  What is it?  No, I'm not kidding.  It's going to make you guys billionaires.  What is it?  It will make you billionaires.  Come on.  Go ahead.  Keep going.  So far on this trip, I've lost two purses.  I lose my bag every day.  Where's my purse?  They have it.  I have no idea what my purse is. 
[03:15:30]  I want to make a line of bags, purses, that has a chip in it.  Tracking device.  Yep.  Lojack for bags.  Yep.  I love it.  Even hire, like, operators that you call up, like, like, like, like, like, like, like,  arm stars.  Arm stars, exactly.  You know what I mean?  My purse is not stolen.  Where is it?  I love it.  It's on 5th Street and 42nd.  We're getting it now.  We even have people in their cars that get the bags.  Let's be realistic.  You know, mention the people putting a Lojack in a purse?  It sounds stupid.  Every person that has money is going to do that.  Of course.  Everyone.  Love it.  Who thought of that genius girl? 
[03:16:00]  That's true, baby.  I am the smartest girl.  You all think I'm just a party girl.  But I'm also a smart girl.  I'm a smart businesswoman.  Oh, that will make billions?  Wow.  It's a purse with a chip in it.  And you track it.  And there's people that just drive around cities waiting to pick up your purse.  We can use the Air Force.  It's a radar station and find my purse.  They got that chip technology ready.  And I'm sure people are using it for just that. 
[03:16:30]  You go, beep, beep.  Like the New York City Marathon happened.  And if you had a loved one in the race, you could just follow their progress.  Track them.  Yeah, on the internet.  Like, oh, wow, they're still in Brooklyn.  Or, oh, wow, they're crossing the bridge now.  What the fuck are they doing?  So there's basically a satellite beam.  What kind of stress is that on your body?  You're running 26 miles and you've got this fucking beam coming down from outer space right  into the top of your head.  We're being cut through every nanosecond of our lives by radiation from radio, TV, satellite. 
[03:17:00]  All that stuff is just blowing through you.  Small little particles, electrons flying through you.  Nice.  If you could see those, if they were visible, we wouldn't be able to see each other.  The air is so just full of those.  Can you say all that in Tara?  That sounds like a Tara.  Imagine radio waves.  Imagine, if you will, just sitting there.  And if radio waves had color to them instead of just being clear now, pals, if they were  like red, it would be like nothing but red in front of you. 
[03:17:30]  And we couldn't watch Tara Dice.  It would be an awful thing.  That would be like crazy.  Like, like right now I'm inhaling them with every drag I take on my cigarette.  I'm breathing in like radio, radio waves.  And I think that's really what's hurting people, not cigarettes.  I got on my knees to suck cock at a party.  I wouldn't be able to see it because of all the radio waves.  I'm like, oh my God.  I'm searching for that dick through all the radio waves.  There's a stiff cock in the room and I can't find it because of the radio waves. 
[03:18:00]  I'm like, oh my God, it's crazy.  Oh my God, guys, I have an idea for an invention.  I have an idea for an invention.  I'm in cigarettes, all right?  I'm in cigarettes.  Instead of just a filter that filters out, like tar and nicotine, we'll have an idea for  that radio wave.  So instead of breathing in like radio waves, you can see it.  And then you can look in the end of the filter and when you see it's brown, like the tar and  nicotine, you could also like put it in your ear and listen to the radio waves that would  have gone in your lungs.  And I can still see the cock going inside it.  And yeah, it was like, as you're puffing, you're clearing a little space just in case 
[03:18:30]  the radio waves get colorful and we can't see anymore.  You clear a hole, like a little glory hole for the cock to come through the radio.  It's my idea.  We'll patent it.  I want 50% and make a billion dollars.  You think I'm just a part of you?  I'm really smart.  I'm a genius.  Moving on.  Here she describes her friends.  I love seeing my friends.  I love my friends so much.  I really have, I got to tell you, the best people and the best friends around me.  They're all just nice people. 
[03:19:00]  Every one of them are.  They always have a good time.  They love to play.  You know, they're perfect for me.  Yeah, let's see if those friends are with you after your career really.  Was there like an ounce of sincerity in any way?  There was no passion at all in her talk about her friends.  She was talking about employees and producers from the show.  People that will be gone and she'll never see again when the show's canceled.  She's talking about the people who roll their eyes the second she fucking walks away.  My good friends, they're such good friends of mine. 
[03:19:30]  And I call them friends because they're indeed friends.  The upstairs is half a square that looks over the dance floor.  In that half a square, there's a VIP area.  So we had half of the whole side of the upstairs that looked over the dance floor.  I loved dancing on the floor.  It was fantastic.  Everyone thought I was going to fall off the floor, of course.  But I loved it swirling around on it.  It was like in the middle of this wall, like this dancing pole.  It was the best party in the second place.  We had the time of our lives. 
[03:20:00]  She cannot describe anything.  I couldn't paint a mental picture of that.  It came out like a Picasso.  And there's like this thing on the floor and a wall.  And the VIP is half of it.  And there's a pole.  And I was dancing.  And people thought I'd fall off.  And there was a teeter-totter and a big sphere and a thing.  And it launched.  And I went.  You know what the funny thing is?  You know, like three feet over, like the Mona Lisa is hanging there.  And she totally doesn't even see it.  It's like she's seeing all this amazing shit.  And she's just like, where's the pie? 
[03:20:30]  They have an Applebee's in Rome.  I don't want to get some potatoes again.  I once had a sock to cock and Applebee's.  Maybe it was a Ruby Tuesday.  They kind of had the same appetizers.  I think it was right next to the Louvre.  The Louvre.  I had Louvre's on the back of my car window once.  And they kept the sun from coming in and stuff.  And there's this whole big building in Paris that just sells them. 
[03:21:00]  It's called the Louvre.  And I thought I was bigger than Home Depot.  It's like crazy.  And all my friends are there.  And I love them.  I love you guys.  You guys are awesome.  You're my friends.  We're all friends, right guys?  Friends.  All my friends are such close, tight-knit friends.  Sure they are.  Well, that was the end of...  This is Sarah.  She's my best friend and my wardrobe style. 
[03:21:30]  I love her.  Isn't she great?  That finishes up her trip to St. Tropez.  St. Tropez.  The Paris-UK one was the best, though.  Yeah.  Yes.  What was that ones we listened to?  No, we just listened to St. Tropez.  Oh, I want to hear some...  The Paris-UK and how she talks about the Eurotunnel and all that.  Unbelievable.  It starts with the Eiffel Tower, and I guess she's talking about getting engaged under the  Eiffel Tower. 
[03:22:00]  If you get engaged under the Eiffel Tower, your marriage lasts forever.  Yeah.  It's a little German legend, but why not?  I should make a sign.  Will you marry me?  Will you marry me?  Yeah, you got a yes.  You got a yes, Tara.  You got a yes.  You said yes.  You said yes.  You have to get down on one knee, sir.  May I have your hand in marriage? 
[03:22:30]  Yes!  Our love is forever!  Oh!  This guy, Mike from Ohio, a tourist right there, asked me to marry him, and I said yes.  And I was like, I don't think it's going to work!  And I was good.  I don't even know who you are, Reed.  But I love Van Wilder.  Oh, thanks.  I just married Tara, Reed.  I love Van Wilder.  Forever!  Empty Eiffel Tower, and you're engaged.  Yeah, no, I don't even know. 
[03:23:00]  Now I'm going to ruin my love forever!  Uh-huh!  Uh-huh!  Wow, that is just jaw-droppingly horrific.  How could you take that off?  It's great!  I can't believe it.  He has me, this guy, Mike, from Ohio, he has me to marry him underneath the Eiffel Tower.  And we're going to get married underneath there when they finally finish the thing and put  the paneling on it.  It's not done yet.  Because it's there, it's just all beams.  I wish a rioting Muslim would punch her square in her fucking face. 
[03:23:30]  How funny it would be if they lit her car on fire with her in it.  Oh, my God, you guys, the Muslims are burning me here in Paris.  This party is the hottest party ever.  I can't believe you shot her.  That was my best friend.  What was her name?  Was that Tabitha?  I mean, that's her.  I can't remember her name, but she was such a dear, close friend of mine.  And I lost my purse in the middle of the rioting.  They lit it on fire, but I had a chip in it.  They should put chips in, like, potato chips. 
[03:24:00]  And any time you want a potato chips, you just hit the chips and you can find the nearest  menu machine.  So I read chip in a chip.  It's going to be a beautiful, wonderful adventure.  It's going to make billions.  And the chips attaches to the chips, and that's what you hold to, so you don't get that dream  of stuff in your finger.  And it comes up on the navigation system on your escalator, and it'll come up like, you  know, barbecue or ranch or, you know, onion, a garlic, potato chip.  It'll tell you what type of potato chip you're going to eat.  Here we go.  All my friends.  It gets better.  She's looking for submarines in this next clip. 
[03:24:30]  What?  Looking for submarines.  Let's go on this gorgeous boat and see the most beautiful sights of Paris.  The lovely love world we're in.  Let's sit here.  When in doubt, do it like the French do.  We reach into my new engagement to Mike in Ohio.  Yeah, Mike.  Go Buckeyes.  Is that a submarine?  I didn't have submarines in the thing.  I mean, a glass water boat, whatever it's called. 
[03:25:00]  What?  Is that a submarine?  I mean, a glass bottom boat, whatever.  Wow.  Is that a battleship, a dinghy, whatever, a sailboat, or what, a truck?  If I was ever married to her, I would have to choke her out every time she fucking woke  up.  The second she's like, eh, eh, eh, just go back to sleep, crazy lady.  Just watch her eyes shut and then let off, let her breathe, but she's unconscious. 
[03:25:30]  And every time she comes to, just choke her out.  Yeah, just keep choking her out.  God damn it, that'd be great.  All right.  Hey.  I'll be your tour guide today.  My name is Tara Reid.  Hi, Tara.  We're in Paris, and that is the Louvre.  Hi, the Louvre.  There was so much art in the Louvre that they had to blow it over the bridge to this place.  They kept it very close to seminar.  That's why they're like it.  Once every eight years, the Mona Lisa leaves that place, goes over that bridge, they bring  it right through that door, and goes right through that window. 
[03:26:00]  Every eight years.  And they say, every eight years on Halloween night, she blinks her eyes.  Can you imagine?  That is the Paris Orleans, one of us.  That's the Musée d'Anse.  The Musée d'Anse, that's another name they call it.  It was an old bus station.  This is the same.  Then we see it, and now it's another museum, right?  You guys, that's the oldest brothel in Paris, right there.  I'm going to work there later tonight.  American history.  That is the sex of the city bridge. 
[03:26:30]  Where Carrie runs away, and Mr. Big finds her.  Mr. Big and Carrie.  That's a major American moment right there, that bridge.  She was wearing her Manolaponic shoes.  Everyone remember her Manolaponic shoes.  And they fell madly in love, like me today.  I'm now engaged.  Tonight from Ohio.  I don't want her alive. 
[03:27:00]  I really...  How did Carson Daly date her?  Wow.  Just keep...  I've met that guy a couple times.  A cool guy.  I guess you just got to keep your dick in her mouth.  That's probably the only way to survive the relationship.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  I was out the other night.  Just keep...  Just keep...  Just keep it full.  That couldn't be...  Imagine you're just some poor motherfucker on a tour, and Tara Reid decides her and her 
[03:27:30]  camera crew are coming on, and she's the one giving the tour.  Yeah, you've been waiting your whole life to go to Paris.  Oh, I wonder what that building is.  Setting up your change.  Oh my God.  It's part of the Louvre.  And every eight years, in Mona Lisa, it goes, uh...  And then we have some sex in the city.  Sex in the city, wearing them on black shoes, and she...  Why?  Who cares?  Ugh.  And the submarine...  Paris is always so crap.  Sorry.  It's okay.  I was just talking about submarine, or, you know, septic tank, whatever.  Paris is always so crap and so packed. 
[03:28:00]  So to have it by ourselves, and, you know, to see Paris...  I mean, we did all these, like, fun, like, silly little, like, tour things.  We walked through the park, and it was beautiful.  There was, like, a carousel.  Then we got up, and we went up, like, and walked down the corner and went to this area,  and we saw all these great paintings and artists and people drawing.  It's the mentality of asking, like, a third grader, what did you do on your summer vacation?  She should come home with, like, a picture she drew with crayon. 
[03:28:30]  You know, when they just have, like, the lines just...  It's just a scribble.  Yeah.  Or when they say, draw you, and it's just two big eyes and arms that don't fit.  They go to color in your shirt, and half it goes over your face.  Goes over the lines and the face.  Stupid kids.  Here she complains about it.  I put some glitter on my macaroni.  I made an ashtray with macaroni and gold paint and some glitter. 
[03:29:00]  I did it all by myself.  I made it all by myself.  It's an ashtray, and as I was making it, I filled it up.  Here she complains that her drink is too weak.  Of course it is.  First round's on me, kids.  Anything for martinis, champagne, whiskeys, cocktails, liqueurs, beers, and anything else you want.  What do you guys want?  That's good.  Yeah, the cocktail's on the back.  Um, can I just have an Evian, sweetie? 
[03:29:30]  No, what do you want, sweetie?  Large bottle of water.  One, two, three.  Four.  What do you want, Dawn?  Four.  Four large bottles of water.  Can I get a peach iced tea?  Um, with vodka in it?  Spice it up a little.  Cheers.  Cheers.  They didn't put any, like, they measured the stuff here.  It's not even, like, an American shot.  It's, like, this big.  You see it was, like, up to here, with ice in it.  So it doesn't even taste like anything. 
[03:30:00]  Bitching, there isn't enough vodka in it.  Can you imagine if she was your girl and you actually took her to Paris, and these are the comments you were making.  You'd be like, I should have taken this cunt to Rhode Island.  Oh.  She's not getting there.  I should have taken her to Six Flags.  Hang on, there was a carousel, and we went on a roller coaster.  We should have went and looked at leaves.  You know what I mean?  We went on a submarine glass bottom boat, and we saw, like, we were walking, and there was people drawing.  Yeah, great.  We went to Athens, and we got some beers, and it was crazy. 
[03:30:30]  They were so weak, the drinks and stuff.  Oh, yeah, there were some old, wrecked buildings that we drove through.  I was like, what are you taking me to the ghetto?  It was amazing.  We had it all to ourselves the same way every other place I got to was all to myself, so it was not amazing.  We went to Greece, and there's this building called the Parthenon, and it's just such a wreck.  Why don't they clean it up?  Fix it already.  Fix it.  It's a real fixer-upper, but for some reason, it won't build on it.  Like, excuse me, the statue's missing the arms. 
[03:31:00]  Poor woman.  She's got, like, no arms, and I think it's a statue, like, to show that handicapped people can do things, too.  If it's an American museum, they'd have the arms on it.  It'd be, like, totally, like, complete.  That's not what you're going to feel like in the Americas, you guys.  We have, like, whole statues.  Statue of Liberty, on her hat.  I mean, she wouldn't even be holding the thing up if it was in Greece.  Imagine if it just had one arm. 
[03:31:30]  Gee.  Where's my drink?  Drunk whore.  Fucking tolerance is ridiculous.  She's, like, she's in the same fucking watering holes as fucking Ernest Hemingway.  She's, like, oh, my God, it's fucking weak.  You guys.  This whiskey.  They're so mean.  This whiskey iced tea.  I mean, come on.  I hate, they're so mean. 
[03:32:00]  Mean, evil.  Oh, my God, look how bad my hair was there.  Looks like strings.  She's talking about the tabloids here.  Looking at pictures of herself in the tabloids.  Why are they so evil?  They're just mean people.  Stop it.  They're like bad pictures of Paris, too.  They're just mean.  You know what I wish I could do?  I wish I could find the editors of, like, inquire of all these people.  And all the mean things they do to us, I wish we could have to sort of follow them around  like a detective and take bad pictures of them and put them in paper every day.  And they would see what it feels like. 
[03:32:30]  They'd be quicker to just try to ruin people's lives.  Yeah, that's what would happen.  Yeah, but she had all of the tabloids in front of her.  Yeah, she couldn't get enough of the tabloids.  And she was going through the tabloids.  I saw this.  And she was looking for her picture.  Yeah, she loves when she's in those.  Yeah, because these celebrities love when their picture is in these rags.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  Wow.  Moving on.  We're almost done here.  Discussing the Euro Tunnel.  My producer just told me that I have to tell you guys a really interesting fact. 
[03:33:00]  We are going 187 miles right now on the Euro Store underneath the English Channel.  I just want you all to know that that's why the walls are black.  We're in a tunnel going almost 200 miles an hour.  On our way back to London.  The tunnel's called the Bula Tunnel.  I'm getting excited.  It's here and I...  What's the name of the tunnel?  The Euro Tunnel.  It's called the Euro Tunnel.  Euro what?  Is it just called the Euro Tunnel? 
[03:33:30]  That's hysterical.  All right, that's even a funnier thing.  We thought, like, you know, in New York City you have, like, the Lincoln Tunnel, the George Washington Bridge.  Here in England, this amazing tunnel is just called the Euro Tunnel.  Oh, my God.  You know what I love, too?  Oh, my God.  She's talking about tunnels and she goes the Lincoln Tunnel and then the George Washington Bridge.  The George Washington Bridge Tunnel.  She couldn't think of another tunnel.  Not the Holland Tunnel.  Yeah, she couldn't think of another tunnel.  I love it.  I love the Brooklyn Bridge Tunnel. 
[03:34:00]  I go over that all the time.  And it's simply called the Euro Tunnel.  I don't know why a bridge that connects France and England is called the Euro Tunnel.  Why is that?  It doesn't have France or England in it.  It should be the Franklin Tunnel or something like that.  She thinks it was a play on your tunnel.  Your Tunnel.  This is your tunnel.  It's everybody's tunnel.  It's your tunnel.  How boring.  It's called your tunnel.  What a complete don't.  We're going like 700 miles an hour.  Like no concept of speed or anything. 
[03:34:30]  You're just a fucking...  And she gets to go to all these places.  I'm so fucking jealous.  Not anymore.  They're canceling the show.  Yeah, but she got to go.  This is it.  I think this is the last installment.  Maybe there's one more.  Look how they...  Whatever the Matt Lauer, how they gave him the hacky, I'm standing on a beach clothes.  Yeah.  The baby blue with the khakis.  It's time for where in the world is Matt.  He's on Easter Island.  Oh my God.  We're here on Easter Island and I just ran to Matt Lauer.  And there's a bunch of like rocks with big heads like carved in them. 
[03:35:00]  I got the first round.  Can we get a Mai Tai here?  I hear they have good Mai Tais here on Easter Island.  Why is it called Easter Island?  Why is it called like Thanksgiving Island or something?  I love holiday, like names of holiday islands and stuff like Tara's Birthday Island.  It's such a great place.  We're here at the Piramids in Egypt.  We're about ready to get a scorpion bowl.  I'm like so fucking way to that.  You know, I can't find the door. 
[03:35:30]  Oh my God.  If a mummy came out of there, I would like so free.  You guys are my friends.  I love you.  I'm going to take my top off.  I'm going to get some really good sun out of here.  Oh my God.  Can you like slide down the pyramid?  Oh yeah.  Awesome.  Would it feel like a water slide up there?  I'm going to do it.  That's my idea.  I'm going to do it today.  I'm going to do it.  That's my idea.  Give me 50% of it.  You think I'm some dumb horror?  I'm going to see a genius.  No, I'm not going to slide down that thing.  I'm not going to.  You can't.  I'm not going to do it.  That looks dangerous.  You guys, it's crazy. 
[03:36:00]  It's crazy.  That would be insane.  I'll let my friends do it.  I'm not going to do it.  Some people are suggesting they could have just taken her to Epcot and Disney and let her  loose and like, we're here in the France pavilion and I'm here and in like three minutes I'm  going to walk over to Japan.  You know what?  It really is a small world after all.  It is a small world.  We're going over to Ireland and I'm going to get some Guinness and then we're going to  Japan and I'm going to drink some sake and then we're going to Mexico for some trifecta. 
[03:36:30]  Oh my God.  I saw you and just saw you in France.  We're here on a monorail and we're doing like 10 billion zillion miles an hour.  Why can't you drink in this fucking joint?  On the instant feedback, a lot of people pointing out that she said glass water boat.  Glass water boat?  Can I have a Walt Disney on ice?  She's just saying whatever she sees.  Is this a glass water fish boat?  Glass water fish tree boat. 
[03:37:00]  I got it.  Is this like a car rubber plastic?  You're just like, you can't see anything because it's all flashes.  You're just like, it's like blinding.  You know, you're just like, and you see spots everywhere afterwards.  You're like, you know, like, hi.  Like, you look like a retard.  You don't know what's happening.  And then they get mad at you too when you're not looking in the right angle for the camera.  You're like, you know.  That's her describing the red carpet.  She's on the red carpet. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, the red carpet.  Is there any wonder her titty was out that long and she didn't notice?  Like, yeah.  Now I believe she didn't notice.  Yeah, but you know what's funny?  At first I thought it was a publicity stunt.  Like, hey, this will get me, get people talking.  But now I believe she just didn't notice.  Not like I thought she was a genius beforehand.  But, I mean, I thought she was like, you know, moderately intelligent.  You can just never tell until they do something.  Until they're babbling like this.  Oh, my God, you guys.  You know, they belong to an exclusive club that we just don't belong to.  And now they're coming for your Social Security.  They're coming for your Social Security.  Carson Daly's looking pretty good now. 
[03:38:00]  Yes.  A lot of people, when he broke up with her, what are you thinking, Carson?  Yeah, what are you thinking?  Now we all know what he was thinking.  Now we all know.  Oh, my God.  He saw this first.  I got to wake up in the morning with this.  See how the fuck he went out with her for that long.  You're going to marry that?  Woo.  Rise and shine, sunshine, rise and shine.  Here's my Carson, baby.  Wake up, baby.  Wake up.  What do you do?  What do you want for breakfast?  Mimosas or bloodies?  What are we drinking today?  Cigarettes still going from the night before. 
[03:38:30]  She's putting cigarettes out in, like, crepes from room service.  Just this no-class whore.  And the hotel yelling at the fucking poor guy that brings the room service.  But I asked for the omelet, Western omelet.  Fucker.  Where is it?  Just breathing smoke breath.  She wakes up in the morning, hasn't had a cigarette in hours, and the first thing she  exhales is smoke.  She couldn't blow smoke rings after not smoking for hours.  My brother dated a girl one time, and they were standing. 
[03:39:00]  It was, like, right at, like, dusk.  You ever see that when the sun and the moon are out at the same time?  Yeah.  And she's like, what?  How can they both be out?  I literally thought it was the same fucking thing.  And he just went like, oh, my God.  How could that work if we're, like, at the center of the universe resting on a tortoise's  back?  How can the sun and the moon, if you go to the, we're going to take the glass water  boat and reach the edge of the earth and look at the sea serpents.  The world is flat. 
[03:39:30]  Christopher Columbus discovered America on the three ships, the Manny, Moe, and Jack.  And it found, like, the founding youth.  And now we're going to go look for something, and that's how they invented Columbus Day.  I hate to say it, guys, but this could be the last Paradise Club.  Oh, damn it.  We've had fun with this.  We had a lot of fun.  We had a lot of fun with this show over the last few months.  But this could be it right here. 
[03:40:00]  It's a very short.  Short clip.  It was wild.  It was a really cool crowd of London.  You know, everyone had fabulous clothes on and crazy makeup.  And we just had a great time.  It's always just about having a great time.  It's the exact same description in anything you saw.  Everything is awesome.  It's awesome.  It's fun.  I love you guys.  Someone's suggesting they probably were telling her the speed in kilometers per hour that she was in,  but just couldn't understand. 
[03:40:30]  We're doing, like, 200-somethings.  She probably couldn't understand the concept of K over miles per hour.  I love it.  It must be so fucking cool to go through life like that.  Like, it just has to be the best thing ever.  She has no worries.  No stress.  Where's the next party?  Where is it?  Where is it?  Those titties are like a backstage pass.  Oh, yeah.  She just was all access.  Yeah.  Never had to learn anything. 
[03:41:00]  Nope.  Oh, what are those pictures of her having sex?  What movie is this from?  Let me see that.  Body shots.  Body shots.  Could you turn the screen a little?  Yeah.  Some sex scenes from Body shots.  All right, guys, you guys.  Very nice.  Dude, how well is that fat kid from Stand By Me doing now, huh?  Yeah, what happened?  Rebecca Romijn.  Oh, getting the pants taken off.  All right.  Tara, naked.  Too much him?  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  Very nice.  They're flapping around.  That's before the implants. 
[03:41:30]  Before the implants, yep.  Oh, boy.  Bam, bam, bam.  Wow, we're really ending the show?  Amazing.  How did that happen?  It's so fluke.  Oh, that's too bad.  Let's say hi to Mandy in North Carolina.  Mandy.  Hi, how you doing?  Hey.  I realized through Anthony's impression that Tara Reid sounds a lot like Corky from Life  Goes On.  I love Anthony's Tara Reid impression.  Yeah, I can't get enough of it.  That's all I got.  All right, thank you.  There goes Mandy.  Let's say hi to Bill in Boston.  Bill.  Yes, sir. 
[03:42:00]  What's up, Bill?  Listen, Bill Burr, we saw you in the Wilbur Theater in Boston, and anybody who has a chance  to see you should see you.  You were fantastic.  Oh, thanks a lot, man.  Absolutely.  We talked to you after the show, my girlfriend Laurie and I.  Very cool.  I saw Bill Burr Friday night.  I saw all his new material.  I absolutely loved it, Bill.  Oh, cool.  I'll be at Rascals Thanksgiving weekend in Montclair, New Jersey.  I finally got my plug-in.  It's Bill Burr.com, right?  Bill Burr on MySpace.  B-U-R-R.  And where are you heading to? 
[03:42:30]  Can you say?  What?  You got the luggage.  Oh, me?  I told you, I'm going to the Patriots-Colts game, and then I'm going out to L.A.  That's right.  I forgot about that.  Good luck with the game tonight, but you guys don't have a shot.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's going to be rough.  Eek.  The Colts are a powerhouse this year, Anthony.  It's going to be the Manning brothers in the Super Bowl.  Well, I like how you said it, good luck with the game, but I don't think you got a shot.  Like, he's shooting up, going to get out there.  Dude, these Boston sports fans, that's how you have to talk to them.  They're convinced that they're part of the team.  They're playing.  Why is he talking about me like I'm not still in the room? 
[03:43:00]  Like I'm fucking retarded.  That's how you got to talk to these guys.  They're morons.  So anyways, Bill, what the fuck was that?  It was just a complete lack of respect for me on all levels.  Well, I'm a little mad that we only get you one day this week, I guess.  I'm taking it out on you.  We'll see you next week.  Dude, you think I'm fucking happy?  I mean, I'm blowing it right now.  You are blowing it.  There's going to be some other red-headed hacks going to come in here, and it's going to be it.  Jimmy's going to be back full-time sooner than you think, and you missed your opportunity. 
[03:43:30]  We want you in that scene until he comes back.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here. </pre>
