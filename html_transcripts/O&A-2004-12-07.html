<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a phone call from Jimmy Norton's mother, concerned about his lifestyle and urging him to exercise instead of his usual activities (implied to be promiscuous).  This transitioned into a discussion about intern Noah's alleged sexual encounter with a porn star, contrasted with Jimmy's less successful attempts.  The conversation then moved to *The Swan*, a reality TV show focusing on extreme physical transformations, with particular focus on a contestant with excessive facial hair.  This sparked a vulgar and offensive discussion about body hair in men and women.  A Utah caller admitted to being addicted to *The Swan*.

The hosts then discussed their free week on XM radio and their promotional efforts, followed by a call from Dallas Cowboys player Tyson Walters, who discussed a recent game and anecdotes about the team's golf course and encounters with Bill Parcells.  A prank call to a Green Bay funeral home, attempting to have a deceased Packers fan "propped up" for the Super Bowl, was recounted.  The hosts also promoted their upcoming eggnog drinking contest and a segment featuring racist music.  They then criticized the Parents Television Council's indecency complaints, using highly offensive language.  A segment analyzing an awkward Larry King interview with Motley Crue, highlighting King's lack of knowledge about the band, followed, interspersed with crude jokes.

The next segment began with a caller stuck in a tunnel with poor radio reception, leading to a discussion about radio repeaters.  More audio clips from the Larry King/Motley Crue interview were played, followed by commentary on other celebrity interviews, including Tommy Lasorda and Bill O'Reilly, with criticism of O'Reilly's perceived hypocrisy.  A listener called about another awkward Larry King interview, this time with Duran Duran. The segment also involved a MiFi contest, featuring a particularly disgusting entry suggestion involving Rich Voss's earwax, which prompted further vulgar jokes and discussions of bodily fluids.  Another call from Norton's mother, advising him to replace his "whoring" with something else, was played.

A lengthy "F.U." segment followed, filled with profanity-laced rants directed at various targets, including drivers, cell phone users, cancer, and each other.  This was followed by a game involving a foul-smelling substance hidden behind Rich Vos's ear, forcing studio guests Paul, Larry, and Pete and an intern to smell it, resulting in vomiting.  The executive producer, Ben, refused to participate.  A caller reported NJ1015 DJs copying their bits.  Opieâ€™s impersonation of Tony Danza led to a confrontation with Danza's security personnel when a staff member attempted an on-site interview, resulting in an alleged assault and the confiscation of the staff member's phone.  The segment ended with a song from a *Silence of the Lambs* musical.

A detailed recounting of the Tony Danza prank followed, focusing on the staffer Eric ("Sex Bagel")'s interactions with audience members and the subsequent altercation with Danza's security guard.  The hosts discussed legal ramifications and potential charges, with Greg Proops providing comedic interjections.  Calls to various people, including a police officer, were made to discuss the incident.  This was followed by the playing of songs from a white power band, described as hateful and offensive, with the hosts commenting on the lyrics and the band's marketing strategy.  Further discussion of the Tony Danza prank and the offensive songs concluded this segment.

The final segment began with the hosts repeatedly insulting various people, including *Brady Bunch* characters,  as "shit dicks."  This was followed by discussion of an intern's encounter with a paid prostitute and the playing of Stephen Lynch's song "Vanilla Ice Cream," containing racially charged lyrics.  A "what we learned today" segment involved callers sharing often offensive anecdotes, insults, sexual innuendo, and celebrity gossip, including references to Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson, other radio personalities and specific events.  The show ended with a plug for Rich Voss's DVD and website.

[00:00:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you for listening.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  You know the Holocaust? 
[00:04:00]  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for most people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls.  What kind of sick mind operates like that?  You know the movie?  You know the anatomy show?  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  Hi, sweetheart.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  How are you?  So, Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here. 
[00:04:30]  But we heard the radio show.  We heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening, which is a wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs.  And, you know, just for like 20 minutes to a half an hour, and you would feel better.  You're sad.  And also, there's gyms in New York.  You could go.  You could exercise.  And you would feel a whole lot there. 
[00:05:00]  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  And you'd relieve, you know, tension and stuff.  And you'd be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just am thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling.  So don't get offended or think I'm strange.  But I am a mother, and I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything's falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on. 
[00:05:30]  I know it's not my business.  But, anyway, I love you, and I feel I can intercede because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  But, anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas.  I really hope you can make it.  And, anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie?  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  I can't get enough of that clip.  I love that one.  I love that phone call from little Jimmy Norton's mom.  That's great.  If you tuned in, well, turned on your radios, I should say, overnight, you just missed one 
[00:06:00]  of the best shows yesterday.  Sucks to be you.  You'll have to wait for the replay, I guess.  Let's try this out.  No.  You don't like it?  I'm not hearing me very well.  How's that?  Oh, boy.  Let me turn this up a little louder.  How's that?  I think you sound fine.  Everyone else is a lot louder, but I think you sound right.  I'm going to have to deal with it.  Okay.  I could turn you up.  How's that?  Yeah, that's good.  How's that?  I like that.  How's that?  Is this better?  Perfecto.  This or this? 
[00:06:30]  This or this?  This.  This or this?  The third this.  This or this?  There's no that.  How about this?  No, that's good.  I would like this.  No.  I'd like to go back to the old days.  How's this?  No.  This?  That's better.  All right.  Yes.  I felt like I was doing an ear test.  I know.  I was raising my hand.  Right.  Left or right?  Right.  Right.  Left.  Right.  Left.  Left, I think.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Left.  Beep.  Beep.  Right.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  It's so nerve-wracking.  It really is.  After a while, you have no idea, and you're just guessing.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  This is the show that everyone wants to intern for.  Oh, I know.  Ben was giving me the stats, and it's amazing.  Yeah, I guess the intern applications went through the roof after yesterday's show.  So, I don't blame anyone after what happened yesterday. 
[00:07:30]  Basically, our intern Danny, it turns out, banged the porn star from...  I mean, no, I'm sorry.  I was just going to say, oh my God, are you kidding?  I'm sorry, Noah.  No, Danny did something else, and that's why everyone wants to intern for the show.  Allegedly.  Anyway, yeah, Noah banged the porn star from Cherry Darts last Friday.  We did that, and Noah takes the porn star home.  He's just an intern living in a crappy apartment in Hoboken, and then he gets to bang a porn 
[00:08:00]  star all weekend.  All weekend long.  And then old Jimmy Norton wanted to do the same exact thing, but it was going to cost him  a thousand bucks.  I laughed all night.  I'm sorry.  I actually lost sleep over this whole thing yesterday.  It really was pressing on my mind also, Jimmy.  I just couldn't get it out of my head.  I felt very bad.  There were a couple times I just woke up in the middle of the night and just started giggling  to myself.  Oh, yeah.  Like, I could not believe what happened to you yesterday.  Watching TV, you're just, huh?  A thousand bucks.  Yeah.  It's cool. 
[00:08:30]  Free for you, but not for you.  Free.  Anyway, so how's everyone today?  Very good.  Yeah?  Yes, yes, yes.  Okay.  A little, you know, a little sleepy.  Stay up to watch that goddamn show, The Swan.  I know.  You're hooked on that.  They got me.  They got me.  And they do the show.  It could be done in five minutes, but they stretch it out for an hour.  And, you know, 10 o'clock is past my Betty by time.  And I got to stay up because that's the big reveal.  And I could care less about the rest of the show. 
[00:09:00]  I want to see the before picture and then the after picture.  That's it.  They stretch it out.  Every time they come back from commercial, let's review what they look like before.  And they got to show everything you just saw.  They recap what you saw five minutes ago.  And last night was pretty good, though.  I saw the coming attractions, and one girl had a shave or something.  Oh, classic.  She was a shaver?  They had a girl that they described having a very masculine body and face. 
[00:09:30]  And she was an outcast, a social outcast, never made friends.  She said she wanted to look.  She wanted to be invisible.  She did not want to be around people.  And then they show her in the bathroom.  And, you know, they told her, look, we're taping the show in a couple of weeks.  Don't shave.  Now, you might think you tell a woman that.  Don't shave your legs, your armpits.  No, your chin.  She had a beard.  She had, like, two sides just on her chin, two puffs of hair, two tufts of very coarse male beard hair that was growing out of her chin. 
[00:10:00]  And you're right.  The producer said, you know, just for TV's sake, you know, let it grow in.  Because I guarantee you, if a girl has that kind of problem, she's shaving literally twice, three times a day.  She said she shaves every morning, and then I don't know whether she shaves throughout the day or anything.  But the way this hair was, they obviously told her not to shave for quite a while because she had hair just growing like a billy goat. 
[00:10:30]  So you and I, as we watch from home, we could feel that much more sorry for her.  Right.  Or in my case, laugh that much harder.  Well, that's what it is.  I was laughing hysterical.  Yeah, but you know there's rubes out there, you know, in the red states.  Let's just call it the Midwest.  Oh, that poor girl, look at her.  That's just like my sister.  She's got the same thing.  They showed her, yeah, shaving, and then they hooked her up pretty good. 
[00:11:00]  I was going to say, because in the past I've seen the show when they have the girls with the masculine bodies and faces,  they always wind up looking like trannies when they're finished.  Yeah.  They get in front of the mirror, I'm beautiful.  Oh, I'm beautiful.  Thank you, doctors.  And the doctors are, ooh, you know, pretty awful.  But she ended up being pretty good.  Yeah.  Wasn't that bad.  And then she won, so she's going on to the big pageant, whatever that means.  Well, then they get all the winners, because they do two people per week. 
[00:11:30]  I love made-up TV.  What the hell is the pageant?  I guess the pageant is the one that had the best reveal or something throughout the season.  They do two girls per show.  And then at the end of the show, like it isn't bad enough they've been slobs their whole life  and then finally get to look halfway decent.  Then they need one more bit of rejection.  At the end of the show, they only pick one of them as the more beautiful one to go on to the pageant.  Yeah.  And they have one more girl to pick next week. 
[00:12:00]  And then they go on to the pageant where all the winners from the other weeks compete against each other.  Yeah, well, and these girls, they lose weight.  They work on their brains, right?  Their head.  Oh, please.  They have a therapist sit down and try to get their mental health.  And then they've got the plastic surgeons that nip and tuck and do what they have to to make them look pretty beautiful.  Here's the deal.  Here's the other thing they do.  They get the best makeup artist probably in Hollywood, the best hair people in Hollywood.  They give them the best gowns for their reveal when they pull back that curtain and they're looking into that mirror 
[00:12:30]  and they start crying and saying how beautiful they now look.  What I want to see is two weeks later when they're back home in their stupid little towns in the middle of nowhere,  like Omaha or something, and they don't have those dresses anymore.  They don't have the makeup artist.  And I think you were saying now they're getting their makeup done at the local Walmart.  Walmart or something.  I want my makeup done like I had it done on the Swan Show.  Oh, we can do that for you. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, honey, we're going to make you look beautiful.  Looks like one of those truck stop waitresses when they're done.  Yeah, they're at the local beauty parlor.  Well, girl, you need the beehive hair, dude.  Right, showing the picture, how they looked only a couple weeks ago on the TV show.  You want to look just like Helen, don't you?  Big beehive hairdo and 60s makeup.  Yeah, they do.  They have the best of everything there to work with.  Their gowns are best suited for their bodies, so sometimes if they've still got a big ass, 
[00:13:30]  these clothiers know what to put them in to make them look halfway decent,  like they don't have a big caboose.  And then they get home.  Oops.  But it is kind of cool to watch when they bring the husband in,  and they haven't seen him in weeks and weeks and weeks.  He's got a couple of months, actually.  And, you know, the husband's just like,  oh, my God, I'm going to be banging a completely different girl.  And they're all thrilled to death about it.  This rocks.  I'm banging a completely different girl, and I'm not cheating.  Baby, could you just shut up when we have sex? 
[00:14:00]  Because I don't want any inkling of the old you.  That's great.  Let's go to Josh in Utah.  What's up, Josh?  Hey, I just wanted to check in with you guys.  Well, if you guys haven't heard you before out here in Utah,  I'm just glad to hear you on the air.  Okay.  And I just wanted to say fuck you to Ant for getting me hooked on this goddamn show.  Isn't that awful?  I hate it.  I've got to see the end.  I've got to know who's going on to the pageant.  I'm a faggot. 
[00:14:30]  All right.  And you were going to say that the hairy chin girl turned out to be hot?  Oh, yeah.  You've got to admit, that chick was pretty fucking hot at the end.  When they flung those doors open and she walked through,  I was amazed.  I think she's going to do very well in the pageant because she really looked like a dude.  She looked like she was a big, boned, very tall, gorky-looking,  and she had that manly-like face.  There was nothing sexual about her, nothing ladylike about her at all. 
[00:15:00]  And then all of a sudden she walked through after they were done,  and she looked like a hot chick.  You know, it wasn't like she was a big girl anymore.  It was like she was tall in a hot way, but it's so funny.  She still had that complete lack of confidence on her face and in her walk.  So here's this really hot chick walking in these heels like she's still the big,  dorky, ugly chick.  Pretty cool.  She's going to, you know she's just going to be a slut because she's gone so long  with guys not even giving her the time of day with her hairy chin and big, boned body. 
[00:15:30]  So she's just going to go out and guys are going to be throwing themselves at her,  and she's just going to, you know, open for business, that vag.  Nice.  Ready to rock.  What is more enraging on a woman than a hairy chin?  It just makes me angry.  Oh, God.  It just has to piss them off at God and everything.  Just everything.  Every kiss, you feel it.  Oh, God.  Just the whiskers.  It's something to stare at.  We're not talking about your date last night.  Oh.  I didn't have a date last night.  Well, I know.  You do the training thing.  I just thought that maybe something happened. 
[00:16:00]  I don't know.  I was just fishing a little bit.  You stare at it when you see it in the supermarket or something.  You go shopping, and there it is, the bearded woman, you know, and you've got to look.  Not only bearded, this is the one thing I don't understand.  You just brought up a memory.  The women, they're usually a little older than middle age, and they've got the mole.  Yeah.  Whatever.  You can't do anything with the moles, usually, right?  But they've got the hair growing out of them.  Yeah.  Can't you just chop that hair off?  Flip it.  Or does that cause cancer or something? 
[00:16:30]  No.  Why don't people chop the hair off their moles?  Because they're lazy and don't think about it, I guess.  It's not just a little.  I mean, sometimes it's like...  Oh, I know.  It's popping way out.  It's just sticking out.  And you're like, what are you doing?  Don't you notice that?  Well, that goes also hand in hand with men who give up on things like eyebrows, nose,  and ear.  You know, when you get older, that stuff happens.  You start getting hair popping out of your head.  Keep it under control.  You see these guys.  It looks like a party favor flying out of their nose.  They've got those eyebrows that... 
[00:17:00]  You know, there comes a point in your life where, I guess, your eyebrow hairs start getting  a little longer than the rest of them.  How about taming it down?  You've got those big caterpillars on your head, and then just the big...  Coming out of guys' ears?  Yeah.  What the...  What is it?  Do you not see that?  What the...  What the...  What the...  What...  You...  Who the...  What the fuck...  What...  Who the...  You've got big hair coming out of your ears.  Remember the dude in Huntington that ran the Rock Club? 
[00:17:30]  He had black...  Frank Cariola.  He had black peat moss on his earlobes.  Frank Cariola ran the Roxy in Huntington in the Rock Club.  He had so much black hair on his earlobes, it looked like peat moss.  It was like his earlobes were dirty.  It looked like they were filthy.  And then you get close and realize it's...  Yeah, peat moss.  Black peat moss is growing out of his ears and on his earlobes.  And guys would just give up.  They give up.  Like women also.  They give up.  They reach a certain age.  They cut all their hair off.  So they have that manly hairdo that's... 
[00:18:00]  Oh, it's so easy to care for.  Yeah, and you completely have given up any femininity in your life whatsoever.  And the guy has to, you know, sit there and he looks at his wife and goes,  She's decided to become a man.  Why am I going to clip my ear hair or my nose hair or my eyebrows?  And they just walk around the supermarket and they're out to restaurants.  So we, the people that still try and keep those things in check, can just gawk at them.  There you have it.  Let's say hi to Jim in Boston. 
[00:18:30]  What's up, Jim?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Glad to hear you on the radio.  I was a big fan back in the AAF days.  My friend Tom Menino wanted me to let you know he's signing a petition to get this free week off the air in the shitty box.  I think it's an awful thing to have on the airwaves.  Yeah, when we did the mayor's prank in Boston, Mayor Menino was convinced that our careers were completely done.  Oh.  And when he went, it's canned day.  How'd that turn out for him?  Well, I'm sure he's not happy that we're in Boston for the third time now. 
[00:19:00]  This is our third shot at getting a Boston radio audience.  What?  I'm trying to convince myself to spend the extra two bucks.  And, all right, go for it.  So I'm going to listen to you this week.  I'm going to give you a call back on Friday and give you a yay or a nay.  Oh.  I still got your CD from Boston.  Hey, Jim, don't bother.  I'm not kissing your ass.  You either want to listen to us or you don't.  I don't really care.  I don't know how the program's changed. 
[00:19:30]  You should see the...  How do you evolve or is it just, you know, hey, I got this show.  Jim, I'll save you a lot of time and effort.  It's the same old shit.  All right?  The same old shit was good.  That's what I want to find out.  Then pay the lousy two bucks and shut up.  Jesus.  Who?  I'm getting e-mail from people like, well, why don't you tell me why I should spend two  bucks on your radio program?  Man, I'm not kissing anyone's ass.  You listen this week.  If you like what you're hearing, great.  If not, oh, well, there's a ton of other things you can listen to. 
[00:20:00]  Because a month of this program is cheaper than a gallon of gas, you cheapo.  Two lousy dollars.  Two dollars.  Two freaking dollars.  Yeah, I mean, we were promoting the fact that we're doing a free play week.  We're going to be assessed by him in Boston.  Nah, he's actually a cool guy.  Oh, he's a dick.  We did a lot of interviews on the other channels yesterday.  Oh, my God, we did.  That was a lot of fun.  I was half asleep for most of them. 
[00:20:30]  I know.  I get the phone call from Straley that we're doing these interviews.  I'm like, oh, God, I completely forgot.  Yeah, he reminded me, too.  Most of them were done with the phone tucked on my ear and between my ear and shoulder.  And you could probably hear in some of the interviews me battling some bad guys as I was playing video games as we were doing the interviews.  I'm a very busy man.  But it's just so funny.  They're making a huge deal out of this.  And I guess it's a deal, sort of. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, yeah, you're saving in the tens of cents.  I mean, what it comes down to, this show only costs $2 a month.  Yeah, so it's hard to make it sound like a big thing to give away any of it free.  Because the people that are listening to us now, except for the ones that are bootlegging the show illegally on the Internet, you bastards.  Yeah.  We hate you all.  Uh-huh.  But the people we're talking to, they already have XM radios.  Yep.  So now they're deciding if they want to spend an extra $2 a month, a lousy $2 a month.  Yeah.  And XM wants us to pretty much shill ourselves and beg people to listen to our radio program for a lousy $2. 
[00:21:30]  I could see if it was like $20 a month or something.  Do you realize that XM, with us added, $2 extra a month, is still cheaper than the other company?  The little doggy company?  Still cheaper.  Yeah, but you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Freeplay all week long on XM 202.  To continue to receive the channel, you'll need to add Opie and Anthony to your XM account.  Call 1-800-XM-RADIO or you can subscribe online, Anthony.  And best of all, I can't believe this is a copy point. 
[00:22:00]  Best of all.  And I asked about this.  They're like, no, we're dead serious.  We're very excited about this copy point, so I better read it.  Better.  Best of all, if you order this week, you'll get Opie and Anthony for the remainder of 2004  at no additional charge.  Oh my God, that is unbelievable.  Hurry, this special deal ends this Sunday.  If you were reading that in February or March, that'd be pretty cool, I would say.  Well, if you wait to the 12th, it's a little more than two weeks left in the year, so you  will save. 
[00:22:30]  You ready for this?  We need a drum roll.  $1.15.  Right.  $1.15?  Pretty much.  Something like that.  For two weeks?  That deal stinks.  It's a little more than two weeks.  Oh, a little more than two weeks.  Hmm.  Nice.  Even if it was from February, you're still saving like, what, 22 bucks?  Yeah, it's really not that much, but at least it would be like, wow, it's substantial.  It's something.  Yeah.  Something other than pocket change.  Is this really our old pal Tyson Walters?  This is really he.  Hey, what's up, Tyson? 
[00:23:00]  Hey, Tyson.  How much?  How are you doing?  What are you doing up?  I just walked into my house from the game last night.  We were up in Seattle and the plane just got in.  Did you play?  Just a little bit on special teams last night, so.  Yeah.  Tyson plays center for the Cowboys.  He's a really good friend of ours.  Can I tell you what a, I'm sorry, go ahead.  What a bad fan I am.  I was watching the game, and I was so angry that I was like, I was afraid I wasn't going  to be able to sleep, so I shut the game off after, I think you guys were down by 10.  I turned it off. 
[00:23:30]  It was like two minutes left.  I'm like, I got to finish writing and go to bed and be in a nice, calm mood.  What a bandwagon scumbag I am, and I deserve it.  Awful.  You know what, Norton?  I want you to stop and start doing that for every game, because didn't you do the same  thing when we played up in New York Monday night last year and we won?  No, when they had a big comeback.  I was actually, it was like 15 seconds left or whatever, and I'm like, hey man, let's  just beat traffic.  And Florentine's like, no, come on, man, let's just stay.  And that was when they came back and beat the Giants.  But yeah, my decision making stinks.  Congratulations.  It was great last night.  Great win.  Were you one of those guys, Jimmy, that were like, ah, the damn Mets, they're not going 
[00:24:00]  to beat the Sox in 86?  Were you that guy shutting the TV off and missing the whole thing?  Oh, I don't remember.  I'm not a Mets fan, though, so I would.  Pretty much everyone turned off the TV.  All the people that claimed that they saw, you know, the ball go for the soccer's legs.  Saw it on their replays.  They're lying.  Absolutely lying.  Tyson, you know I hate the Cowboys, but I watched just to watch my pal Tyson Walters  play.  And I'll always point you out to people that are in my house, like, dude, there he is,  my friend from Dallas.  Yeah, hopefully I'm not getting back.  I'm so pathetic. 
[00:24:30]  I'm like, I know someone in the NFL.  How happy was Parcells last night?  Oh, he was really happy.  I mean, you know, he was saying it was one of the best games that he's ever seen.  And there was this, you know, strange circumstance winning that game.  How miserable is he, though?  He's miserable, isn't he?  Well, he's not happy that we haven't had a better season, so, you know.  He doesn't like being involved with teams that aren't Super Bowl-bound.  He's very angry.  Yeah, I predict that he'll resign within a week or two, because he's like, all right, 
[00:25:00]  this isn't going anywhere.  I'm going to find my new team.  This guy has no dedication.  I know you're not going to say it, but.  No.  No, Coach Parcells has dedication.  I can't let you do it.  Don't worry, dude.  I know what you have to say.  It's me.  I'm not talking to you.  You're trying to get me fired, aren't you?  Not really.  You know, it's me, Opie, saying that you're going to be losing to your coach within a week  or two, because he can't be bothered.  He needs to find that next Super Bowl team.  That's what he's about. 
[00:25:30]  He's about winning, but he puts it in his hour, so.  Yeah.  Nice five and seven now.  I think they're on a roll.  They're definitely, numerically, they're mathematically not out of it, because the NFC is having a rough  year, so.  I've got to thank Tyson Walters, personally.  I went down to Dallas with Norton.  He was doing some comedy gigs when we were on hiatus, so I followed Norton around the country  a little bit here and there.  I went to some of the cooler cities, and I went and played golf with Tyson Walters at  the Dallas Cowboys golf course.  Really?  You've got to explain the Dallas Cowboys golf course. 
[00:26:00]  I've never seen anything like this in my life, and I got to meet Bill Parcells.  We're on the driving range, just kind of hitting balls, getting ready for our tee time, and  all of a sudden, Tyson goes, I think that's Coach.  He doesn't even call him Bill or Mr. Parcells.  There's Coach.  And then we take the golf cart over there, and we had a little chit-chat with Bill Parcells.  Yeah.  Cool.  That was nice.  Huh?  We had to say hi.  It was January.  We were able to play golf.  And, you know, the Cowboys course is a whole entertainment experience, as Jerry would like to say. 
[00:26:30]  Mr. Jones, I should say.  And Jerry Jones, he just built a golf course for pretty much the organization.  Really?  Yeah.  He's got the Super Bowl trophies there, and, you know, he puts on the whole show.  Do you think he could buy XM?  He might be able to.  We can talk it out and see what he has to say.  But everything is Dallas Cowboys, you know, logos everywhere.  It's all blue and silver, what have you. 
[00:27:00]  Did you play with cowboy balls, Opie?  They have them on the range.  I'm sure they do.  So there's a cowboy logo on everything.  And then, you know how, like, you get to the Midway, you know, shack to eat some hot dogs and stuff?  It's like Dallas Cowboy cheerleader rejects.  They're still really hot, but they weren't hot enough to make, like, the cheerleading squad.  You would be good for the golf course.  So they're, like, serving, like, hot dogs and stuff to you at the halfway house. 
[00:27:30]  You'll get nothing like it.  But it was unbelievable.  We had a great time that day, didn't we?  Oh, yeah.  We had a blast.  It's a good time.  And Tyson could hit the golf ball.  I've never, I mean, I've played golf off and on my whole life.  This guy, you've got to see how far he could hit the freaking golf ball.  It's scary.  I've got some girth behind it.  300-yard drives, no problem from this guy.  Over and over again, no problem.  But that was a blast.  And then the pro shop, it's just cowboy stuff everywhere, you know. 
[00:28:00]  Jerseys and stuff, right?  Oh, yeah.  At reasonable prices, I imagine.  Of course.  Well, I get 40% discount.  Box of 12 balls, that'll be $8,000, please.  I actually spent, I bought about 15 balls.  I spent, I think, $90 on them once.  Isn't that great?  Is that a lot?  I don't play golf.  No.  So, yeah, it's not cheap.  That's okay.  Golf stuff is always expensive.  If you buy it in a pro shop, too, you're just, you're ridiculous.  You're pulling out that credit card and spending a lot of money. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Everything good with you?  Yeah, everything's good.  I was just...  How was the flight from Seattle?  Oh, long.  Yeah.  What do you guys do on the flight?  Watch movies.  And sleep, probably, right?  Yeah, a lot of guys sleep, but a lot of guys still have problems sleeping.  You just finished the game, so you've got some adrenaline going, so...  Yeah.  Then you can't fit in those seats.  Not too well.  Are you sitting in coach seats on a plane?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Imagine being a football player.  Wait, you guys don't have your own plane?  No.  Because we only use it, like, during regular seasons. 
[00:29:00]  That's right.  It wouldn't be economical.  So, do you guys have the whole plane, though, or do you have to, like, fly back with business  guys and stuff?  No, no.  It's a charter, and we take, like, all the local press and even some of the national ones  that are in town, and the whole team and support staff.  It's a production.  So, do they reconfigure the seats for you guys?  Like, at least take out some rows so you have more leg room?  No, there still isn't a ton of leg room, but the best thing that they do is they put  two guys in a row of three, so that's our luxury. 
[00:29:30]  So, you get that middle seat.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow, that is awful.  Yeah, that would have been stuck between, like, Larry Allen and Eric Williams in 1994.  That would probably be a very unpleasant cross-country flight.  I imagine it would smell good, too.  Good point.  Hey, when are you guys coming back to this area, or you're not this year?  No, we're going to be up there.  We actually finished our regular season out January 2nd on Sunday night game.  So, I'll be up in town and, you know, looking forward to seeing you guys. 
[00:30:00]  Will you be able to stop in here at all?  It depends.  I'm hoping to stay in town after the game, assuming our regular season, or our season's  over and we don't go to the playoffs.  I'd like to stay in town, but we'll see how that works out.  Do you guys really think you might go to the playoffs?  If you really look at the tiebreakers and how it all is panning out, you know, if we  win three of the last four, it looks like there's a good chance.  All right.  Yeah, it's very possible.  The NFC, man.  Wasn't Seattle in contention, too?  Now they're like seven and six? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, Seattle was in contention, but then they lost to us and they're tied now with St.  Louis and St. Louis owns a tiebreak, so they're pretty much out of it.  You know, things have been falling our way, so we just have to do our deal.  All right.  Well, Tyson, thanks a lot.  This was a nice surprise.  Well, just trying to wake you up and make you a little happier.  You got the XM yet or no?  Oh, hell yeah, I do, man.  I've got the little boombox thing.  I've got the thing to plug into my entertainment center, and I just got a new car and got to  put it in there.  All right. 
[00:31:00]  Cool.  All right.  Don't be a stranger, right?  All right, man.  Cool.  Our buddy Tyson Walters.  See you in at the House Cowboys.  Peace.  Peace.  There he goes.  He's a great, great guy.  Yeah, he really is.  Look at that little celebrity call in like that.  Well, just our buddy in the NFL.  It happens.  We're on our way.  He's just, he's as big as that whole doorway.  Oh, yeah.  He's absolutely huge.  We're down at, where were we in Dallas at that club there?  Right near the Improv.  Where?  It's near the Improv, right?  Is that the one that's connected to the same little area as the Improv? 
[00:31:30]  I don't remember.  No, where did you perform down there?  Oh, the Improv.  Yeah, the Improv.  Okay.  I think you meant the little club you went to.  And he comes walking up to Norton and I.  He can't believe that, you know, he's meeting us because when he was playing college football,  I think in...  Cleveland, Ohio.  Columbus, I think.  Right?  Cleveland or Columbus.  Columbus, I think.  Ohio.  Whatever, yeah.  He would listen to us on, I think it was the Big Wazoo when we were syndicated up there.  The Big Wazoo.  And he became a huge fan and then he makes it into the NFL.  Wow.  And he goes to see Norton with a bunch of the Cowboys and they all come up to us after 
[00:32:00]  the show, these massive guys.  And we thought we were going to get killed ourselves.  Get your ass kicked.  Yeah.  And they're like, no, man.  We're huge fans.  We can't believe you guys are down in Dallas.  And we hit it off and we've all been friends since.  Hey, but before you really start feeling good about yourself, Jimmy, about, you know,  NFL guy calling up, good friend, Bobby De Niro.  I saw the picture.  I just want to, like, needle you a little more with that one.  There's a picture of Mr. De Niro.  He looks so handsome, too, with Grace Hightower in the paper from the event.  I saw that.  He had no problem having that picture snapped, did he? 
[00:32:30]  Well, I think, yeah, they're probably married.  I mean, the one for the paper.  You know, any picture.  No, no, yeah, no.  Bobby De Niro didn't seem to mind that one.  No, no, as long as it's going to be in the paper and not on Jimmy Norton's wall.  Yeah.  Wall of fame.  That one hurt.  All right, and while we step aside, on the way, we got Larry King talking to Motley Crue.  We got a couple clips.  It's really funny.  What a complete tool.  I mean, really funny.  And is the guy here that's going to do the Voss thing for the MiFi?  Oh, that's today.  We've been asking you guys, what would you do for MiFi?  It's still not too late.  You can just send an email through foundrymusic.com or opianthony.com, and we'll pick the best 
[00:33:00]  ones, and we'll give away some more MiFis before Christmas.  Sure.  A guy's coming in today to smell behind Voss's ear.  Oh, not just that.  He's going to have Voss rub behind his ear, and then he's going to sniff it.  Then he's going to suck on the finger.  After smelling the rancid whatever that is behind his ear, he's going to suckle on the finger.  And then, the showstopper, he's going to eat one of Voss's disgusting boogers. 
[00:33:30]  It's too early for that, but much.  Nothing.  You look like Damien from The Omen in that sweater.  I know.  He looks like me.  Oh, wow.  That is good, Jimmy.  He certainly does.  Not that it matters, but none of us know how to dress around here.  Every day, it's just funny to see what everyone's wearing.  You know, because I think we all get dressed at like 3.30 in the morning.  Oh, look at you, all stylish. 
[00:34:00]  I have my clothes put out for me.  That's why you look all right.  Yeah.  My girlfriend puts my clothes out for me at night, which is really a time saver in the morning.  You can see who still has a girl in their life.  Yeah.  Look around the room and figure out who still has a girl in their life.  Damien.  Ben's tight sweater doesn't even hit his belt.  That's like a sweater dickie.  Oh, my God.  You just take it right off from the front. 
[00:34:30]  Boik.  And you look very good.  Oh, well.  Coordinated.  The colors all look right.  Oh, I know.  When I dress myself, I'm just a mess.  Plaid and stripes?  Sure.  Sure, why not?  Sure, that goes.  All right, so we've got Larry King on the way.  Also, the Voss Eargoo thing for the Mifi.  And all the racist music.  Oh, my God.  What a toe-tapper, some of these songs.  I've got to tell you, I was planning on hating this music and getting pissed off.  Well, to hate music, that's why.  But I see it as more comedy. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  There's a lot of comedy in these songs.  It is hate-filled, though.  It's definitely hate-filled.  But the bad part of it is, bad or good for them, is that they're catchy tunes.  It's like they're catchy little rock tunes that have kind of a funny edge to them, but  the lyrics are completely hateful and racist.  Yeah.  So, we'll get into that in a little while.  I think we're going to get the owner of the record label on the show, too.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  We were talking about football, so we got a little prank call we did to Green Bay. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, I remember this one.  When the Packers were going to the Super Bowl, remember?  Go Pack, go.  And we called the funeral home, and this is what happened.  Funeral home.  Hello?  Yes, ma'am.  Okay.  My name's Artie Milo.  Uh-huh.  And my father had recently passed away.  Did your dad pass away, did you say?  Yes.  Yes, he did.  When was that?  I don't know.  Two, three days ago.  Okay.  Now, he wanted to watch the Super Bowl with his family.  Uh-huh.  And we just want to know if there's a way you can come over and, like, you know, 
[00:36:00]  temporarily, you know, prop him up in the big chair so when the family comes over,  he'll be okay until after the Super Bowl, and then we'll bury him?  No, we can't do that, Mr. Milo.  Oh, it was his one dream to watch the Packers in the Super Bowl,  and we already painted his face green and gold.  No, but it would be, you mean, not get him until then?  Yeah, well, you could come over and maybe, you know, pump him with whatever you do  and, you know, preserve him until after the bowl. 
[00:36:30]  No, I'm afraid we just can't do it.  Why?  It was his dream, you know, to watch the Packers in the bowl.  Uh-huh.  And we've been holding on to him for a couple of days now.  He's been in the barn, but, you know, the coyotes have been a-nipping,  and I don't think he's going to make it until Sunday.  Now, he died.  Who knows that he has died?  Hopefully no one.  But we just want you to come over and, you know, prop him up in the chair  and maybe open up his hand so we could put a beer in there.  And we can't do that.  We can't embalm anybody at home. 
[00:37:00]  Embalm, that's the word.  And once they're embalmed, they can't be, you know, they can't be in a sitting position.  It just kind of...  Well, he's been in a sitting position now, and he's getting kind of hard.  But if you could maybe do something and then lay him down later?  No, I'm afraid we can't.  We'd even be up to, you know, if you've got to break something, it's okay.  No, we don't do that.  It was his one lifetime dream.  You see the Pack in the bowl with his family,  and we got the big screen TV and the chair for him,  and he went up and died.  We will not do that.  If your dad has died and if you really have not notified anybody, 
[00:37:30]  you do have to do that.  You have to have the medical examiner's approval to take him away.  Okay, look, what if we put the coffin in the house  and put the TV on the coffin?  That way he'll be with the family.  Is there a law or something?  No, if he was embalmed and if he was, you know, able,  if there's no problem as far as preserving him.  Right.  And could you put, like, a pack banner in his hand?  Because it was his dream to see the packs in the bowl.  We could probably do that. 
[00:38:00]  You could put a pack...  Well, that's okay?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if we could have a visitation, you know, in the house,  depending on how, you know, how well he preserved he was  and if we could get a casket into the house.  But once he's, you know, once he's embalmed, he is laying down.  Right.  Okay.  Do you think that's, like, degrading if we put the cheesehead hat on him?  Do you want me to call the medical examiner for you?  Oh, no, that might not be a good idea.  Then we'd have to try to explain where his feet went.  Bye.  Let's do it!  The Opinality Show. 
[00:38:30]  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Shut up!  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Shut up!  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work. 
[00:39:00]  Shut the fuck up!  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Here, check it out.  The Opinality Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We're going to be giving away another MiFi within the hour.  Just waiting for Rich Voss to show up.  Our contestant is here somewhere, right?  We saw him outside hanging out earlier this morning.  Jim saw him out on the street, didn't you?  Well, I was walking in the building in the morning.  He was there in the front door.  All right.  And also, I think next Friday, we're going to do the eggnog contest. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, we're doing that.  Yeah, we got to do the eggnog contest for another MiFi.  We're going to get, I don't know, how many people should we get?  Like 10?  10's a nice even number.  10's a nice number, right?  10 people to drink, I think, like a double shot of eggnog every minute until they either puke or have to take a leak.  Wow.  Last man standing wins the MiFi.  That's a toughie.  Every minute.  Oh, the first few will go down easy. 
[00:40:00]  This is easy.  Oh, this is nothing.  I got it in the bag.  When does the competition begin?  Ha, ha, ha.  Everyone will chuckle.  10, 15 minutes go by.  All of a sudden, it's just going to be gurgling in your stomach.  Big garbage, pal.  I can just picture it now.  It's going to be an awful mess.  Oh, projectile vomiting of eggnog.  Why not?  What could be more Christmassy?  What's wrong?  The whole country is just, can we stop with the FCC? 
[00:40:30]  Can we stop?  Yeah.  The guy called Mexicans wetbacks.  I'm sorry to interrupt.  He called Mexicans wetbacks and he's off the air.  I just, I hate it.  Well, that's not the FCC.  That's the paranoia.  No, I know, I know.  At the radio stations, you know, where the managers have no tolerance anymore.  But it's the same.  The reason that management is cracking down so much in regular radio is because of the FCC.  So they fire you for saying these offensive, you know, what they deem offensive things because of the FCC.  Even if it has nothing to do with FCC violations, you should be able to say wetback. 
[00:41:00]  You should be able to say whatever you want.  Is it offensive?  Of course it is.  People be offended by it?  Yes, they will.  Is it against FCC rules?  No.  You should be able to say that.  It's a freedom of speech issue.  No one wants to hear it.  They shouldn't listen.  If they're offended by it, sorry.  Change the station.  I'm glad all this stuff is happening because, you know, the FCC and all these wimpy managers  that are running all these radio stations across America, they're just drawing the attention 
[00:41:30]  towards satellite radio.  Yep.  Proving that you and I were correct by choosing to go to XM Satellite Radio.  Anthony, we could have went back to commercial radio, but why would we do that?  If we do go back there, it'll be under our terms.  The Wild West.  That's where we are now.  Pshoo!  Pshoo!  Something related to that, Jimmy.  Did you know that, what's his name, Michael Powell was saying that indecency...  Is that me in it? 
[00:42:00]  What?  He was saying indecency...  I have to say.  He said the number of indecency complaints soared dramatically to more than 240,000.  The figure was up from roughly 14,000 in 2002.  How about that?  Doesn't that sound huge?  Yeah, a lot.  What Powell did not reveal, apparently because he was unaware, was the source of the complaint. 
[00:42:30]  According to a new FCC statement, nearly all indecency complaints in 2003, nearly all,  as a matter of fact, 99.8%, 99.8%, that's statistically all, indecency complaints were filed by  the parents' television council.  One activist group filed 99.8% of all FCC complaints.  It's not an outcry that people want decency in this country. 
[00:43:00]  There's not this huge morality sweeping the nation that all of a sudden the FCC complaints went up  because the American people have decided they are tired of it.  They don't want to hear this nonsense on this.  It's one group, one group of people that have, obviously, have an agenda.  It's a religious agenda.  It's a political agenda. 
[00:43:30]  It's a morality agenda that they have, and they want the rest of this country to think  and listen to stuff like they listen to, and they want them to think like they think.  One group.  This should be illegal.  Repugnant.  They should be charged with something because of this.  Yeah, harassment.  Harassment.  And I bet you a lot of them never even heard the broadcast.  They get a mass email to every other pukey parent member, and they just forward it to the FCC.  Of course not.  Of course that's what happens. 
[00:44:00]  And that 99.8% of all complaints in 2003, 2004, they're on track to have filed 99.9% of all complaints this year,  when this year finishes out.  99.9%.  That is all.  I'm sorry.  99.9% is every complaint that comes into the FCC comes from one group.  That's true.  If you bang 99.9% of the girls in your town, you're doing pretty well.  You did every girl in your town. 
[00:44:30]  You could say that and not be held.  And the one chance could just be that little twerk with the short arms going,  Oh!  It could call back to yesterday.  And why isn't this making huge news?  It really should be huge news today.  Because when everybody was saying it was the entire country finally standing up,  finally standing up against these shock jocks and this filthy mouth radio and television, 
[00:45:00]  it's been revealed that it isn't the American people.  Yeah, the reality is the average person doesn't really care.  They don't care.  They're entertained by this or they're not.  They don't care enough to sit down and write a letter to the FCC about something they were offended by.  They just don't.  They're too busy living their lives and making a living and feeding their kids and paying the bills.  They don't care.  And if it offends them, it doesn't matter to them so much that they now feel that the rest of the people that do enjoy it  have to have it taken away from them. 
[00:45:30]  Have to suffer.  You know what they do?  They change the station just like everyone says they should.  Change the station.  But this one group who filed every complaint that went into the FCC, they have an agenda.  They have an agenda.  But then the owners and the managers of all the radio stations, you know.  They buy the crap that was fed to them that it's the American people.  Yeah, they fold like cheap tents and they fire their DJs and change formats, you know.  Yeah.  They get all paranoid.  Well, it's time for them to stand up to these. 
[00:46:00]  To these.  To this one group.  To this group.  To this one group.  Unbelievable.  Regular radio is so done.  Oh, it's done.  We knew it.  We knew it and most people will know it in another, I don't know, six to eight months.  They ran pissing their pants away from the parents' television council.  That's what they did.  They ran with their tail between their legs from one group.  Pussies in regular radio.  What a bunch of faggots. 
[00:46:30]  Just run away.  Change formats.  Fire people.  Grovel.  Kiss the ass of these congressional hearings because of one group.  You're a bunch of pussies.  You deserve to have no talent left on any of your stations when they all leave to go to satellite radio.  Do we have the audio of the senators talking about you and I down there in Washington?  Oh, that was a fun one.  That witch from New Mexico.  Oh.  Do you want to cry?  Cry.  I just started crying talking about how her kid had to watch the Super Bowl boobing. 
[00:47:00]  The kid, you know, the kid didn't even see it.  No one saw it.  The thing flashed out so quick and then they made it sound like everyone was freaked out by it  and the public was outraged and the children were harmed.  Bullshit.  None of that happened.  No one saw it the first time around.  Nope.  I was watching the TV when it happened and I didn't know what I saw.  I looked and said, what was that?  Was that a boob?  Was it a pasty?  Was it a fake boob?  No one knew until they showed it 8,000 times and told you how damaging it was going to be. 
[00:47:30]  And slow motion.  And slow motion, yeah.  And showing the stills.  Watching that boob go,  The only kids that were negatively affected by that were ones that were watching it at her brother's ranch.  Yeah, there you go.  Need a mouth swab?  All right, well, there you go.  There you go.  There you have it.  Regular radio. 
[00:48:00]  Larry, run away.  Run away.  Larry, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  I'm from the D.C. area.  What's up?  Hi, Larry.  Hey, well, my thing is this.  I'm 24.  I've been hearing, you know, the N-word jokingly used on the radio my entire life.  And now people are complaining.  Hold on.  Let's slow down.  You hear that word used in your own communities by your own brothers jokingly.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So what's the big deal?  There's no power left in that word either way because of how you guys do it.  He's saying why is wetbacks all of a sudden a problem when guys have been joking and saying it for years. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Okay, okay.  He's like, if we hear that, why is wetbacks all of a sudden getting people yanked off the air?  No, it's just this one stupid radio station.  It's all paranoid that their DJ, who probably sucked to begin with, and that's why they really got rid of him, said wetback.  And they're like, whoa, we can't have that, and they fired him.  They freak out.  I don't think it's sweeping the nation that all of a sudden people are completely outraged because DJs are saying wetback.  It's just this one isolated incident.  It's never sweeping the nation.  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  I hate when people point out that the American public are tired of this. 
[00:49:00]  They always try to rally the American public and try to make people believe that it's a much bigger cause than it is.  The American people are outraged.  No, they are not.  The American people are working.  They're raising their children.  They're not outraged.  They know better.  The majority of the people in this country know that if they hear something they don't enjoy, they turn it off. 
[00:49:30]  They don't write letters.  They don't try to have it removed because they are offended by it.  It's small groups that have to use the American people because no one would pay attention to them if they knew it was a small group.  Yeah, I think we can all agree that the general media is pretty garbage.  Hey, Jimmy Norton, you suck, man.  That's what?  All right.  Thanks, Larry.  All right, there you go, Sam.  Thanks, Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  Speaking of Larry, time for Larry King. 
[00:50:00]  I wish I could do a Larry King impression, but I can't.  All you got to do is sound miserable.  Garlique.  I use Garlique, and you should, too.  I shill for this.  Des Moines, you're on the air.  Welch's grape juice.  It's got antioxidants.  What?  Well, Larry, what an irrelevant person.  Unless he's interviewing somebody that's 80 years old on his show, he has not a clue what he's talking about. 
[00:50:30]  And who do they plop in front of him?  Motley Crue.  Motley Crue.  I guess Motley Crue's getting back together.  Yes.  Big reunion tour coming up.  Why wouldn't you have, I don't know, anybody else than Larry King doing this interview, introducing Motley Crue?  The Motley Crue?  The Motley Crue.  As Larry likes to call him.  No, he didn't.  He called him the Motley Crue?  Yes, he did.  And then he doesn't even know who he's talking to half the time. 
[00:51:00]  He doesn't know the members.  He's just, he is awful for this.  Why wouldn't you have, like, what's his name?  Who's the older rock guy from MTV?  Oh, somebody hipper like the Parents Television Council?  Yeah, there you go.  Kurt Loder.  Kurt Lode.  Kurt Loder.  What a bore he is.  I know, but at least he would know the band.  You know, if you want to, if you're going, if you're Motley Crue and you're saying, hey, let's get an old guy to do this.  Ha, ha, ha.  Know what's going on?  All these news organizations are trying to become a little younger and a little hipper. 
[00:51:30]  They really are.  Larry King?  Well, I'm not saying Larry King is going to get the job done, but they're, you go back 10 years,  CNN's not interviewing Motley Crue is what I'm saying.  No.  You know?  No.  So, all of a sudden, Larry King, look, we're going to, you know, throw you in front of Motley Crue here.  You think it has to do with, like, Brian Williams coming in?  Yeah.  Brokaw, and they're really trying to young up the news organizations now?  Brian Williams had Bob Costas on the other day, and all of a sudden they're doing a little interview.  I'm like, this is not the news I'm used to watching all these years.  Well, they were saying Brian Williams now is a very funny guy from what the news is printing. 
[00:52:00]  He's very funny.  We wouldn't know because he blew us off.  I know.  He blew us our show.  Oh, scheduling conflict.  We're going to have to reschedule the Brian Williams interview with you guys.  The conflict was he was scheduled to be on this show.  Right.  What's the problem with coming on our radio show?  Well, let me play devil's advocate.  This guy's stepping in to be Brokaw's replacement.  He's got a certain thing, and he doesn't know.  He just knows what he hears.  Anal sex where?  All right, we'll call him tomorrow.  That's all it is.  When you put it that way. 
[00:52:30]  Well, thanks, Norman.  When you put it that way, I'm leaving.  Anthony Michael Hall blew us off.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  Anthony Michael Hall couldn't be bothered with this program.  Yeah, you're right.  I guess you're right.  Oh, I always do that, too.  Like, if we just got bananas delivered, and what you do is you go ring-ring, and you pick  the banana up, and you pretend you're talking to it.  Girls love it.  They do the girls laughing.  Of course they do. 
[00:53:00]  John in the tunnel, what's up?  Nah, I just wanted to be left on hold.  Why?  So I could hear the show while I'm in the tunnel.  Oh, he's in the tunnel.  Oh, nice.  Now, this is a good fan.  Certainly is.  And watch how bad of a host I am.  Oh, you're hanging up, Bob.  Don't do that.  No, you can't hang up.  Oh, oh.  You're a dick.  No, don't do it.  His only lifeline to the outside world from inside a traffic-filled...  He sounded like Pesci right before he got shot.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  We have great listeners and awful hosts. 
[00:53:30]  We're just awful.  We just don't treat our listeners right.  Poor fella.  He's in traffic.  He wants to hear the show.  Right, he wants to hear the show.  Well, the signal, the only place you can't get it, I guess, is in the tunnel.  So he was smart enough to call and have us place him on hold, and there you go.  They've got to get what they're called, the repeaters, in the tunnels.  They've got those repeaters all over the place.  Yeah, but they're not in the tunnels.  They just haven't figured that part out yet.  You've got to get them in the tunnels, so when you're stuck in traffic in the Midtown  Tunnel or something here in New York, you know, you can still enjoy the program. 
[00:54:00]  Yes.  All right, so Larry King interviewed Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  And we quickly got, like, four clips together.  You guys are groovy.  Is that the right lingo?  So, hey, 23 Skidoo with the Motley Crue.  You tool.  The first one, I think, is the most, I guess this one's kind of, there's not much to it.  This one's not much to it.  It's the setup, though, and then we've got three that are pretty funny. 
[00:54:30]  You know what it is?  It's just surreal to hear him with Motley Crue.  Right.  You know, it's ridiculous that this guy knows nothing of this band.  We're going to take you backstage now at the Palladium in Los Angeles.  They're about to go on stage.  First time together in a number of years.  There's the crowd outside.  All the crowd knows is they're going to see a major group, and there they are, folks.  Motley Crue is back tonight.  Look at them all excited.  Tonight.  I guarantee that guy, Larry doesn't know one Motley Crue song. 
[00:55:00]  Motley Crue is back tonight.  Who the fuck are these guys?  Who's the, what?  You think they spell it C-R-E-W?  He really is an ass, jackass.  There's Tommy Lee, the drummer and author of the New York Times bestseller, Tommy Land.  Vince Neil, the vocalist.  Mick Mars, the guitarist.  The Beatles.  And Mickey Six, the bassist.  We'll start with Tommy Lee.  All right, Tommy, how did this happen?  I have no idea, actually.  No, I'm just kidding. 
[00:55:30]  Well, all the promoters were calling us,  and saying that all the fans wanted this,  so we all got together and we pulled it together in true Motley Crue fashion.  Like, the fans want it, so let's do it.  Give it up to the fans.  We made some new music.  We did a new video, and we're going to go out on tour.  But, Vince, you had a bad breakup.  What's going to change now?  Well, we still hate each other, but we're calling it.  No, the good thing is, is me and Tommy have found a common bond in Peter Grigio. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  What?  He got that real late.  What are they saying?  And Vince Neil's not lying.  They hate each other.  Of course they do.  They're doing this for a nice payday.  What?  I don't even understand what you guys are talking about.  You can tell he just read, like, a bio real quick.  Now, you guys, how did you get this together?  Now, Vince, the vocalist.  Oh, it's like he's on the tarmac at Idlewild with the Beatles coming in. 
[00:56:30]  You just come off of your DC-3.  I'm here on the tarmac at Idlewild Airport with the vocalist Paul McCartney.  Maybe Larry should have partied with the guys before he interviewed them.  Yeah.  I passed out.  I had a heroin needle in my arm when I woke up.  I was snorting a line of ants with Ozzy last night.  When the Motley Crue came in, we're going to snort some ants today. 
[00:57:00]  That's right.  And then we're going to snort some garlic.  And then I'm going to go to sleep on my posture-pedic bed.  Let me tell you, people, you can't get a better night's sleep.  Can I just shill a little more?  All right.  Here's another clip.  Larry talking to Motley Crue.  This is where he's all confused between Nicky and Mick.  Oh, he has no clue who Nicky or Mick are.  And Mick looks awful, huh?  Yeah.  Mick has got some degenerative bone disease where his bones fuse together. 
[00:57:30]  And he also just had hip replacement surgery.  And he's a good 15 years older than everybody else in the band.  Yeah, that's right.  When they got him, he was a lot older than the rest of the guys.  But he was in that age bracket where he was still okay.  You're like at the high end, but the rest of the band are pretty much kids.  But then if you ever, you know, years later do a reunion like this,  you're the old guy.  I hear he just looks awful, huh?  He looks like the Crypt Keeper.  He is pasty white.  I talked to Eddie Trunk last night, and Eddie did a sit-down meeting with all of them.  And he said Mick just looks like they dug him out of a grave and put a wig on him. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, he's in hell.  He's in hell.  When is Eddie's show here?  He broadcasts out of here, right?  Yeah, on the weekend.  Oh, okay, cool.  All right, here's another cut.  Larry talking to the gang.  Were you bothered by the fact, Nick, that Tommy got so famous?  Was that Mick or Nick?  Mick.  Mick?  Mick Mars.  That was a question I can't hear.  Were you bothered by the fact that Tommy got so famous? 
[00:58:30]  This is a really...  Larry, you know what?  This is a really stupid question.  Why?  It's not good.  Were you bothered by the fact that Tommy got so famous?  I was so depressed.  I was befuddled.  I didn't know what to do.  Come on, Larry.  You can do better than that.  Wow.  Wow.  You can't give it a shit.  No, I can't.  No, I can't.  Quite frankly.  I don't even know who you guys are.  Why, my Nick?  Right.  My Nick?  That'll cover it.  They told me to do this interview or I'm going to get fired.  What a dumb question. 
[00:59:00]  I didn't want to...  Tommy Lee's cock being so big, did that upset you?  Right.  Do you think he watched the porno?  Do a little research?  Tommy, you're hung like a Louisville slugger.  How does that feel?  What was it like banging Pamela Lee Anderson McNick?  Pamela Lee Majors.  What?  Where am I?  I have no clue where I am. 
[00:59:30]  But my tux bed lets me sleep at night.  Pamela Lee Majors.  What is he jack off?  What is he doing?  Looking like a buffoon.  Why would he agree to this?  All right.  Well, on.  Motley who?  No, crew.  Who?  Crew.  I have no idea.  All right.  Here's another.  Is this where he calls him the Motley crew?  No, that's coming up.  Oh, I love that.  Nicky, Nicky's not depressed, is he? 
[01:00:00]  You're not the other down, are you, Nick?  You're up.  Hey, Larry, you got to come out and see one of these shows.  Yeah, I got to.  You start in January.  How long are you going to be in L.A.?  No, no, no.  February.  You and Tommy are going on tour in January.  We headed up.  We headed up.  We headed up.  So you're out on the road in January.  He's got everything wrong.  He doesn't know who these people are.  I love this. 
[01:00:30]  What a buffoon.  It's so uncomfortable.  It's great.  It's cringe.  I wish I would have seen it.  We got the video.  The video is up on the website.  I got to see it because you can tell he's looking at the monitor at the wrong people and he's  addressing the wrong guys.  How long are you going to be in L.A.?  I don't know, a day?  Yeah.  What kind of question is that?  The great publicist that they have to get him on Larry King.  That's what that is.  I guess so.  He must have somebody else that he wants.  How long are you going to be in L.A.?  He's used to his buddies, you know, at Vegas, you know, you're opening for what and then 
[01:01:00]  closing at the Trop for a week and he'll be there the whole month.  Yeah, for the month of January.  He has no idea what these shows are about or anything.  You guys are kind of like a Rat Pack, but instead of like, you know, singing and having  cigarettes, you wipe your dicks and tacos.  Maybe I could come over your apartment and crap on the floor like the old days.  God, how long are you going to be in L.A.?  That's an awful, just, I don't know what else to say question.  He has not a clue. 
[01:01:30]  He's not very well prepared.  Jim's right.  He's on CNN, though.  He can't be prepared.  This isn't like a college radio station.  Picture one of your parents interviewing Motley Crue because it's the same thing.  Yeah, picture her asking, like, you know, maybe if Nikki Sixx wants to get on the treadmill  and lose some weight.  Vince, there's a treadmill downstairs.  Perhaps, you know, perhaps you don't have to have the, you know, your road crew bring  girls backstage so you can all bang them. 
[01:02:00]  Dr. Phil says.  Dr. Phil says when you give something up, you should replace it with something.  He's got your mom's voice down already.  One of the things they actually show in this clip is Vince Neal's facelift.  He had $80,000 worth of plastic surgery.  He did.  I saw him on the swan.  Yeah.  They made him into a beautiful chick.  Were you going there, Steve?  He was totally going, yeah.  You were going there.  I jumped right in. 
[01:02:30]  I was like, oh.  Biv from Wagbag.  I jumped out of a frying pan into your hat.  Here's Biv from Wagbag.  I hate this interview.  The questions don't work.  The band's been broke up for seven years.  There you go.  All right.  Noah was funny, too.  Just going off on a tangent.  Tommy Lasorda was on.  Bill O'Reilly.  Wow.  Tommy Lasorda.  Yelling and screaming.  He's always yelling and screaming about the baseball thing.  Yeah.  About the baseball.  Oh, there it is. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, no.  Now he's on Good Morning America.  Wow.  That's weird.  He looks the same.  He doesn't sound the same, though.  Oh, fat man.  Really?  He doesn't sound as tough these days.  And he wants all the Major League Baseball players to rat each other out.  Really?  Yeah.  Like a baseball Gestapo?  Yeah.  And O'Reilly's like, oh, they're not going to do that, obviously, you idiot.  No.  It's like the cops.  Those guys in baseball, they don't rat each other out.  And then stupid O'Reilly's saying how Barry Bonds, you know, I don't necessarily disagree 
[01:03:30]  with him, saying that, you know, all his records are now tainted and stuff, and what should  we do, you know?  And I'm thinking about, well, what about you, O'Reilly?  Yeah.  Everything you say now is kind of tainted.  Talk about tainted.  Right.  How about a vibrator on your taint is tainted?  Right.  You disgusting man.  You can't watch him the same way anymore, especially when he says, well, now Barry Bonds'  whole career is tainted, and the records, there should be asterisks, possibly.  I mean, what is Major League Baseball going to do at this point?  When people like O'Reilly have a scandal, they love just making like it never happened. 
[01:04:00]  Rush Limbaugh, same thing.  They love making like it just never happened.  But when somebody else is embroiled in a scandal, they will pile on like the playground bully  and get their kicks and shots to the head in.  But their scandal?  Their scandal wasn't really a scandal.  They were right.  The other people were wrong.  They pay a lot of money to get off the hook, go back to work like nothing ever happened,  and they continue just beating people who are also saying that their scandal is not a scandal. 
[01:04:30]  But for some reason, just hypocrites.  Just awful hypocrites.  I like how Opie called him Stupid O'Reilly.  Is he going by that name now?  It's the Stupid O'Reilly Show on Fox.  What the hell's my Fox thing?  Sorry about that.  I was asking.  What happened, Opie?  No, I was just asking Ben for something.  Let me go to Lou.  Hey, Lou, what's up? 
[01:05:00]  Hey, I want to know if Larry King asked the crew about the Motley Crue Challenge.  Oh, right, the Motley Crue Challenge.  Why don't you tell me a little about the Motley Crue Challenge?  Well, Larry, what we do.  What was it?  It was a double-dong dildo, I remember.  Yeah, double-dong.  And you put a $100 bill in the middle, and whichever girl reached it first with her badge got the $100.  We do that on the Larry King Show.  Yeah, we could have gave Larry King some great research on Motley Crue. 
[01:05:30]  Of course.  Tommy Lee, you're a pussy.  Hang up on me.  Remember that one, Opie?  I think we should just play that today.  Hey, you call me a pussy one more time.  I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  You're a pussy.  Right.  Doug in New York, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I don't know what I was doing watching Larry King, but right before Richard Nixon died,  I guess Nixon was supposed to be on, but he died.  And so as a last-minute replacement, they got Duran Duran. 
[01:06:00]  Duran Duran.  I'd rather interview a dead Nixon.  Dude, Larry, I guess, were he and Nixon buddies or something?  He was just tearing these guys apart.  And I'm like, what are they doing on his show?  Why was he tearing them apart?  About what?  Just being a bunch of bisexuals?  Pretty much.  Nothing to rip them apart.  What's with these outfits?  What do these outfits mean?  What do you guys think?  These outfits.  All right.  What's with your outfits?  It was just terrible.  I felt bad for those guys.  What a curmudgeon fashion.  How were you involved in Watergate, Duran Duran?  I'm just going to ask the same question.  All right.  Your groundbreaking trip to China. 
[01:06:30]  You went to Rio, did you?  Tell me about your dog, Checkers.  Why were you sweating so much when you were debating Kennedy?  Wow.  Which one is it?  Oh, two times.  What are you guys talking about, Ope?  I wanted to play something, but I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I thought that was a menu.  I did, too.  I thought...  No, no, no.  Those are obviously a big menu of discs that we have with stuff on it. 
[01:07:00]  Right.  And I thought he was showing you a menu for you to order something.  It's just a smoothie menu.  During the show.  A wine list.  No, it's just O&A style.  A little Cabernet.  I just want to get to the meat of what happened.  Could you go find that?  Don't worry.  It'll all make sense in about ten minutes.  All right, here's what happened.  I want to play Tommy Lee getting really pissed off at us.  Oh, I thought you were talking about when Ben was at the party and the girl yelled,  Ben, I'm doing this for you, and then hung herself off the balcony.  Thinking. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  Someone got it out there.  But what he showed me was two...  Sorry, guys.  But he showed me two tracks.  The first one's like 18 minutes long, and the second is 16 minutes long.  We don't want to sit through all that crap.  I just want to get to the meat of it.  All right.  Sorry.  I just have to step on the gas pedal and get this heavy rig up to speed again.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I got a jam on the brakes.  Jimmy was in the road.  I really did just kind of bumble out there all eagerly.  Hi, guys.  And I feel out.  Big sweaty hand on the brake handle. 
[01:08:00]  Sparks coming off the train wheels.  Yes, he is.  And I fell out of the truck about two or three miles ago.  Can you pick me back up?  I want back in on the show.  Look out.  Jimmy's in the road.  Anthony's doing a bit.  I'm like...  I'm ordering from a menu.  Reading a menu.  Norton's going for obscure references.  But Ant's still going down the highway by himself.  But long obscure references.  That was a four-minute setup.  It certainly was. 
[01:08:30]  It was like when Ben was the boy.  Stay with me.  I jumped off the back like miles ago.  What were you even saying?  I don't know.  I had to slam this truck back into first gear.  We really...  We really have ADD at times on this show.  If you ask me what you just did five minutes ago, I have no idea.  I'm sure it was funny.  Great.  Here's the last clip.  Larry King talking to The Motley Crue. 
[01:09:00]  When he introduces them as The Motley Crue.  This is the one you like.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come at the Palladium in Los Angeles.  They're back together.  Their first live get-together in five years.  The Motley Crue.  All back.  The Motley Crue.  All back for their first get-together.  They're going to have coffee.  My friend and I would like to have some coffee and cake.  Yeah.  I know that one. 
[01:09:30]  How dare you!  Their first get-together.  What an irrelevant idea.  He get-together.  But he's running out of air.  He doesn't know how to announce a band.  The Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  God, the DJs from The Bone do a better job introing bands than Larry just did.  And Larry's doing it for the whole world right there.  That's pretty much a world premiere.  Big rock intro.  Listen to him.  Listen to him.  Lose his breath.  He doesn't know what he's saying.  He doesn't feel the energy of the crowd.  Wait, was he announcing that to the crowd? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he must have been up on the big screen.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come at the Palladium in Los Angeles.  They're back together.  Their first live get-together in five years.  The Motley Crue are back.  You know what?  And I know Motley Crue is obviously doing this for all the money.  Of course they are.  Do you really want Larry King introing your big return to the music biz? 
[01:10:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, he's spitting over his fake teeth.  He doesn't talk that loud ever for any occasion.  You know what's going on with Larry King?  I'll tell you what's going on.  All the other guys are being pushed out the door.  Tom Brokaw didn't want to retire.  He was pushed out.  Dan Rather pushed out.  Larry King's looking around going, oh boy.  I'm next.  I better start doing some hip things here.  Or the young guys are going to take over my job.  Carson Daly's waiting.  Yeah, and then I'm going to be the one walking by the dumpster. 
[01:11:00]  Seeing all my old CNN tapes in the garbage pail.  He's going to show up to work tomorrow morning dressed like Hopper in Apocalypse Now.  With a little headband and an arm and jacket.  I'm cool.  I'm hip and groovy.  I'm with it.  I'm going.  I'm gone.  You guys want to hear some Motley Crue today?  Something a little different?  You have the Motley Crue?  I want to hear like a...  Motley Crue.  He's ready to spit his teeth out.  He was yelling so loud.  I've got Live Wire. 
[01:11:30]  That's the best song.  You know, well, they have their new single.  I'm not playing this piece of garbage.  Is it bad?  I don't know.  I assume it is because they're just getting together for all the wrong reasons.  It might be good, Opie.  Sometimes you've got to give it a chance.  If I die tomorrow...  Girls, girls, girls.  I want to hear Dr. Feelgood would be good.  No.  Yeah, why not?  I don't like that one.  You really don't like Dr. Feelgood?  I don't care.  Which one do you like?  Live Wire.  That's great.  I take Viagra at Tattletales.  Girls, girls, girls. 
[01:12:00]  Red Hot.  It's a good song.  Red Hot's good.  Your home shit home is good?  I'm trying to play a big hit here for everybody.  Well, looks like Kill was a big hit.  Dr. Feelgood, Ant?  Dr. Feelgood.  Dr. Feelgood.  If you have it.  How about I'll...  Hit it.  Shut up.  All right.  All right.  We'll be right back. 
[01:12:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:13:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:13:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:14:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:14:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:15:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:15:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:16:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:16:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:17:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:17:30]  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony free play all week long on XM 202.  For the people that aren't paying for the channel yet, to continue to receive channel 202 on your XM radio, you'll need to add Opie and Anthony to your XM account or call.  Well, you can do that by calling 1-800-XM radio or subscribe online.  Best of all, hold on, you'll be right back. 
[01:18:00]  I'll tell you, it's only $1. 
[01:18:30]  You're going to get the show after a couple of times, you're going to get the show after a couple of listens anyway.  You've got to listen a few times.  A few times. 
[01:19:00]  Kind of get involved, know the characters.  Big soap opera.  You know the zeros that make up the zeros that make up the staff at the Opie and Anthony program.  Rich Voss is outside the studio.  I see that.  I told him to go back outside.  I go, wait for your big introduction now that you're a big freaking star.  Let's just make him sit out there.  He has no idea what we're talking about.  Look at those stiff, non-bending fingers.  They just don't bend.  We're just going to make him sit out there.  He's getting all impatient. 
[01:19:30]  He thinks we're doing it because he's a big star.  No, we're doing it because you're an ass.  Oh, he's going to hear that in a few seconds.  I know, so quickly open the door and get him in here before he hears that part.  Now, our buddy is outside the studio, Rich Voss.  He's going to help us today.  There's a lucky listener that's going to win a MiFi, Anthony.  We're giving away MiFis every week up until Christmas.  I can't be part of this.  Why?  It's going to be hot.  Yeah, right there.  No, he sits there.  Let me just move my jacket so you don't... 
[01:20:00]  So you don't what?  Get his finger on it.  So basically, we've been asking people what would they do for a MiFi.  We got hundreds and hundreds of entries and a few we like.  Whatever happened to that girl that wants to have sex with a girl and a guy?  That might have been a gag.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Well, that's too bad.  Well, if you want to do something for a MiFi, it's not too late.  Go to opianthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  By the way, Foundry Music has a lot of great video clips up this morning.  Hey, check those out. 
[01:20:30]  Kind of like an Opie and Anthony Greatest Hits video thing is going on up there.  A little retrospective.  Yeah, so...  Boogers?  I think I got some.  No.  You always do.  I can't.  I'm really going to be disgusted.  We've been taking entries for a week or two,  and this one kid who's out there came up with a great idea.  There's a thing that happens behind Rich Voss' ear.  That was my idea.  What?  That was my idea, not the guy out there.  Are you insane? 
[01:21:00]  No, I said it on the air.  No, the guy wrote in.  He heard me say it and wrote in.  You're not taking credit for this one.  I know.  What, do you want to get a writing credit on this?  It's not a big deal.  So you thought of it.  No, I'm not saying it was a big deal.  I'm just saying that that young man out there...  Why couldn't you have run him over with a truck?  Why?  I'm just saying...  You should have run him over like roadkill today.  You jammed on the brakes and saved him and threw him back in the cab.  I think today we needed to run him over. 
[01:21:30]  That young man out there just...  You're wrecking the whole flow of the show.  All right.  You're looking good, though.  You lost weight.  He did, didn't he?  You're working out at the gym down...  No, he isn't.  He works out with a guy named Jim in his room.  You look good, though.  You did lose weight.  You know, he did not lose weight.  You don't think so?  No, he's just wearing baggier clothes.  No, I'm telling you.  I did lose weight, right.  He did.  He lost weight.  Do you have a scale at your house, Jim?  No, I don't.  He's not a complete spectacle anymore.  No, I don't.  For what?  You don't have XM Radio yet because you're cheap and you're Jewish.  Well, I haven't been around to get it.  Of course, I've got...  A redundant phrase there. 
[01:22:00]  What are you talking about?  I'm not cheap at all.  I'm a high roller.  Armani Glass is a coach wallet.  I'm sitting with, you know, $1,000 with the lighters in my pocket I'm going to go get  worked on.  What are you?  I'm cheap.  I'm a player now, you know.  You're not a player.  Player.  You're not a player.  Relax.  I'm a player.  That's why you need to come into the show like once a month so we can knock you back  down to size.  And it's going to be more than once a month.  It's just that I've been on the road in very busy.  No, it's going to be about once a month.  Trust me.  Trust me.  So you can't do it, Mr. Black?  Call Voss. 
[01:22:30]  Exactly.  Exactly.  When your book comes out, okay, call Voss.  You know when they have that guest on Letterman and you know he's only there because someone  canceled last minute?  You're our guy, okay?  Oh, that's good.  That's not a bad spot to be in, though.  Listen, hey.  Who canceled today?  Paul Mercurio?  Yeah.  What happened?  He tripped on his bottom lip?  Canceled.  Juice came out.  Slipped on it.  He's got to be trashed.  All right.  Here's the deal.  There's a lot going on here today, Voss. 
[01:23:00]  We're going to give away the MyFive, but then you're talking about Norton and we have  to, because you don't have XM Satellite Radio, we have to play Norton's mom's phone  call again for you.  What happened?  Because you guys are really good friends.  You know Norton likes to share with the audience about his whoring and his girls and stuff,  and he announced, I think, early last week, right, Anthony, that he's going to give up  whoring.  Give up the whores.  And he means it, and we wish him luck with that.  Are you really?  Well, so far it's been rough.  I slipped a couple times over the weekend and then once last night. 
[01:23:30]  I'm living on Banana Peel Hill.  You slipped again last night, bro?  Yeah.  On a Monday night, what could be wrong?  That seems like the night that you could kind of skate through and go, all right, I made  it through Monday.  Sit home.  It's Monday.  I mean, Thursday, I could see maybe it's a little tougher.  You know, you're getting near the end of the week.  Friday and Saturday, forget it.  But Sunday and Monday, you should be able to get through without whoring.  And you're an entertainer.  Entertainers don't, I mean, you work clubs all over the country where there's always one girl. 
[01:24:00]  Do you ever see my act?  It's about AIDS and my fat torso.  No chick wants to bang you after hearing that.  No, that's not true.  I've hooked you up a lot of times.  I've seen my buddy there, Adam Ferrara, do a gig and then gets off the stage, goes to  the bar and girls are clamoring over him.  Yes, because it's a pity bang.  Watching that.  Adam's handsome.  Yeah, he's handsome.  He's very good looking.  He's got the charisma of a rock.  No, he's a very handsome guy.  I like Adam.  He's a handsome guy. 
[01:24:30]  He's not weasel out of him.  I go, I like Adam.  He's a nice guy.  I like the guy.  He's a good guy.  All right?  Bash my friend like that.  I don't know.  It's like banging Wyatt Earp.  The charisma of a rock?  I don't know.  He just doesn't move a lot.  Wyatt Earp?  Wyatt Earp.  Wyatt Earp had a limp.  He's doing references for people from the 1800s.  That had limps.  Jesus.  He reminded me of John Wesley Harding.  Why?  Well, he snored.  Wyatt.  You know, I'm only...  Who the hell knows that one?  You know, Adam, everybody...  Nobody in this business... 
[01:25:00]  Wyatt Earp?  Nobody in this business does not like Adam.  Everybody likes Adam.  Of course.  You cannot not like Adam.  Absolutely.  That's why you've got to say something negative.  Have you ever heard anything negative about Adam ever?  No.  Just that of you.  Yeah, of course.  Okay, so, you know, Norton's parents has the XM Satellite Radio.  Get out of here.  And the mom...  We love Norton's mom.  She's the sweetest lady you'll ever meet.  And she heard that Norton is going to try to give up whoring.  She thought she'd give her son a little support. 
[01:25:30]  So she calls his machine.  And, of course, Norton runs in here with it.  It is really uncomfortable.  She left him.  That's the show.  I've already played this thing five or six times.  I don't know.  I want to hear it.  And I'm going to play it another five or six times because it makes me laugh so hard.  I'm sorry, but it does.  She was almost my mother-in-law because his sister liked me.  Oh, that was a dreadful, dreadful time.  She had a crush on Rich.  Did you have sex with her?  No.  Are you kidding me?  I would never do that.  No.  No.  I would never.  She's cute, too.  She's cute. 
[01:26:00]  She's like Norton with, you know, a shape.  She actually is really cute.  You know how awful that would have been, though, to have to walk around just knowing that you'd...  My friend Adam Ferrara had sex with my sister.  No.  Yeah.  How old is Adam?  How old is her for a while?  Same age?  For like a year.  They were going to...  Oh, they were dating, though.  Yeah.  You know, they were boyfriend and girlfriend.  That's nice.  Which was like, oh.  You know, you go out with Adam for years and years.  I was going, you know, out to clubs with the guy and stuff and watching him. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, I'd like to bang that one and this one and that.  And then all of a sudden, he's, you know, going out with your sister and he tries to put  on the air, like, you know, he doesn't say things like that anymore, but, you know.  You know, he's still thinking it.  Dogging with your sister.  It's like, oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That's awful.  You call him he's out of breath.  You know what he's doing.  What and who?  Hey, dude, smell my...  Ah, I forget.  Yeah, because, you know, when smartasses all get together, you talk about chicks and stuff 
[01:27:00]  and it took him completely out of the mix.  Couldn't talk about that stuff anymore because it's my sister.  Oh, my sister's so ugly.  I'm happy when somebody was banging her.  Really?  What a mess.  Your sister's a mess?  Oh.  And she's loaded.  She's got a lot of cash.  Completely loaded.  What'd she do?  She's got, like, you know, a 52-foot boat.  She's got that Porsche.  I mean, she's loaded.  What does she do?  She's Jewish.  No, no.  She was the...  What does she do?  She opens her legs.  No, listen to me. 
[01:27:30]  That ain't going to make her money.  She's a mess.  I'm the best looking in the family and my parents like me the best.  She, I don't know.  She's loaded, man.  She just works for like...  Won't say what she does.  She used to, you know, she used to work for Warner Lambert, a drug company.  Yeah.  She was the head of publicity and now she's with, like, another company.  I don't know.  She's got, you know, whatever.  I'm just saying, you know, you got a cute sister.  You got a cute sister.  Do you want me to save you?  Because you're going nowhere.  Yeah, because I'm like, what does she do for a living?  Well, she has a boat.  Right, right.  I'm like, Natalie Wood. 
[01:28:00]  What does that mean?  Jesus, Mitch.  It's so early.  I got off a train.  Why are you traveling on a train?  Because I'm so tired.  I didn't feel like driving, man.  The train station's right behind me.  All right.  Well, here we go.  So this is the phone call that Norton's mom made to Jimmy after she heard that Norton's  going to try to give up pouring.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here.  But we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way. 
[01:28:30]  And you were talking about giving up, you know, the ladies of the evening.  You can't even say hookers or whores.  Ladies of the evening.  That's my favorite part because it's just like, you know she read that somewhere in one of her novels.  The ladies of the evening.  Wait, everybody's fine here.  No one asked.  Yeah.  Jim, I know you're trying to give up the ladies of ill repute.  I understand you were pulled over for unlawful carnal knowledge. 
[01:29:00]  You can't meet a nice damsel in distress.  Oh, this is the best.  Which is a wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  Dr. Phil.  How cute is that?  Oh, she's a true American.  Oh, yeah.  Replace something with something.  How do you replace whoring with something?  Oh, she's got a man for you. 
[01:29:30]  Mom has an idea, doesn't she?  She does.  Well, I think Gacy's mom made this call.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs and, you know, just for like 20 minutes to a half an hour and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also there's gyms in New York you could go.  You could exercise and you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up and you relieve, you know, tension and stuff.  And you'd be meeting other people. 
[01:30:00]  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know I just, I'm thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling.  So don't get offended or think I'm strange, but I am a mother and I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything is falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway, I love you and I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking special license. 
[01:30:30]  But anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas.  I really hope you can make it.  And anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie?  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  You can go down to the gym and lose weight.  He's losing weight rapidly.  That's why he's giving up, hookers.  Oh.  I just found the opening to my new CD, by the way.  What's that?  That call.  Oh, without a doubt.  That is great.  You have to put that on your CD.  First track.  Voss actually brought up a good point, though.  You know, could you imagine?  I'm sure, you know, maybe John Wayne Gacy or Jeffrey Dahmer gets the call. 
[01:31:00]  Hi, Jeff.  It's your mom.  I know, you know, you're trying to give up drilling holes in Asian gentlemen's heads and  eating their genitals.  I don't know.  Maybe you could go to the gym.  Maybe get on a treadmill, Jeff.  I'm your mother.  You know, I love you.  You know, Dr. Phil said when you give something up, you should replace it with something.  So, you know, I don't know what eating Asian gay gentlemen's brains, you know, what the 
[01:31:30]  trade-off would be for that.  Or eating their testicles in the stew that you cook and keeping their heads in your refrigerator.  But, you know, perhaps a rowing machine or something like that might, you know, you tone  up.  Keeps you busy.  I just, you know, I'm your mother and I just worry a little bit.  You know, I bring a casserole over for you to eat. 
[01:32:00]  I open up the refrigerator and there's a thigh in there.  You know, I'm your mother.  Dr. Phil says when you give something up, you should replace it with something.  So, I don't know.  And that doesn't work with testicles because if you just replace one with the other, it's  the same if you're eating, you know, a testicle, right or left.  It really doesn't matter.  I worry, dear.  Okay.  I love you, Jeffrey. 
[01:32:30]  You know those, like, calls how to exist, you know, all right?  Still a mother.  He's an ad with genius.  Still a mother.  I was thinking John Wayne Casey to myself.  Oh, yeah.  Hi, John.  It's Mom.  Miss you.  I caught your clown show.  Me and Dad love it.  You know, I understand you like dressing in your clown makeup and killing homosexual children 
[01:33:00]  and gentlemen and burying them in your basement, covering them over with lime and lying about  it, being a perfect, upstanding citizen of society.  But, I don't know.  I'm a mother and I worry about you.  I don't know.  Dr. Phil says, if you, if you, what is that, replace?  Oh, if you give something up, you should replace it with something.  I don't know.  Replacing an eight-year-old with a 12-year-old pretty much is the same thing. 
[01:33:30]  You're still killing children.  Gay gentlemen.  I just worry.  I'm your mother.  You know, when I went downstairs to do the laundry and I'm stepping over the graves of  the dead, I just worry about my boy.  Okay.  I love you, John.  I didn't get this mom made that call.  That is so sweet that your mommy calls you like that. 
[01:34:00]  That very, it's really, you know, that should get you girls right there.  That you have that relationship.  Girls dig like guys with relationships.  I have a good relationship with my mother.  I'm not a woman hater.  You have some of the hottest girls all the time.  Where?  Are you kidding me?  Where?  But they just want to be friends.  The one in Connecticut that wanted to blow me, that one.  She was cute.  Oh, she's the one that gave me rent boys, my friend.  She was cute.  Yeah, she was.  Ariel, good looking.  She's still friends with her, but she's not banging me anymore. 
[01:34:30]  These girls just want to go around and say,  Oh, I, Jimmy Norton, I know that guy.  Well, Ariel's my ex.  That doesn't count.  We're friends.  It's, you know.  Yeah, but I'm saying, at one point you were with her and she's hot.  So what?  So I'm saying, you get hot girls all the time.  So should I carry her picture and show hookers and go,  Look, how about something off?  No.  She used to fuck me for free?  Could work.  Try it.  Oh, man.  So, should we give away the MIFI?  No.  No?  I'm... 
[01:35:00]  What?  Do you think you got some action behind the ear today?  Oh, yeah.  Let me keep this on for a while.  Give it to the guy.  I'll have a little sweat, too.  Build up the sweat?  This is what this...  No, the headphones?  The headphones are building up some sweat.  Do you have any of those boogers?  I might have some.  I don't know if I have any boogers.  Can't you just give the MIFI to the guy and we can move on?  Do you think we can give it to retarded Randy Quaid?  Don't touch his ear.  He's going to hear that now in a couple of days.  All right.  Well, we asked people what they would do for MIFI, 
[01:35:30]  and this guy out there wants to smell what Voss has behind his ear.  A bunch of us that are associated with the show, we've done this.  I dry heaved.  A couple of the guys have puked.  It's absolutely awful.  I thought he wanted to eat it, too.  Yeah, Rich has a problem with the guy sucking on his finger.  Well, so give me like a CD disc, and you can see the oils.  No, you don't put it on the oil.  Why would you waste it?  Why would you waste such...  No, I'll take it.  Listen to me. 
[01:36:00]  I take it from my ear.  Wait, hold on.  And I'll have enough on my finger where I wipe it on the disc,  and he's got to lick the disc.  No, he licks it off your finger.  You wash your hand after.  No, why would I...  Okay, lick it or suck my finger?  Suck your finger for a second.  Are you out of your mind?  I'm going to let that mutant out there suck my finger.  That's the thing, yeah.  Or you have a disc.  You don't let him lick it.  Maybe I would either.  He gets a scrape against the back of his teeth, like that.  That's not bad.  Oh, what's wrong with you?  Wow.  Why?  We found what you're replacing the hookers with. 
[01:36:30]  Wow.  That's not bad.  You wash your hand.  Would I do it?  Absolutely.  You would put your finger in...  Look at him, in his mouth.  Against the tooth like that.  Maybe I wouldn't let him suck my finger, but...  Well, how about this?  Instead of that, you have to get to rub it under his nose.  That's not nice.  Listen, look at...  No, not a disc.  I'm going to show you something.  I'll do my fake ear.  I'll do my...  Wait, wait, wait.  Not the good ear.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What if you rub it on his upper lip, and he has to lick it off?  Oh, God.  But what's the difference if he licks it off there or licks it off the...  The upper lip is worse.  Yeah, because then it's going to linger there for a while. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, it's got to be under his nose.  Yeah, because it's under his nose.  It's the whole thing.  I could do that.  I'll do it about like that.  And his mustache.  Yeah.  I'm going to Seattle for a second.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, what is this?  My five, you five.  We all five from my five.  We have a high five.  You don't know what a my five is?  My five, it's one of the...  You guys are too geeked out for your own good.  No, not at all.  It's one of the hottest items this holiday season.  It's a portable XM Satellite Radio.  First of its kind.  It's amazing.  You can download onto it, mister. 
[01:37:30]  You can download the show and then listen to it on an aircraft if you want to.  Yeah, you can download any of the channels from XM Satellite Radio, and then you listen  when you want.  You could go miles beneath the crust of the earth and listen to something that you have  downloaded onto.  Honestly, we don't geek out too bad on this show.  It really is a very cool product.  It's revolutionizing the whole satellite radio industry.  It's slightly bigger than an iPod, and it looks really cool, and you can listen as you're  walking around.  Remember the revolution in audio when the Walkman first came out? 
[01:38:00]  I remember being shown on the Walkman when it first came out.  And this was where, if you wanted to listen to something on the go, you put on those big  headphones.  It was ridiculous.  You had the regular transistor radio with the little earpiece.  And then when they came out with the Walkman and you put the headphones on and listened and  were amazed at the sound and that you could take it around with you, this is the next step.  And then the Discman?  Right.  Now you're talking satellite radio.  I think the CEO of XM Satellite Radio had something to do with the Discman. 
[01:38:30]  Really?  I do believe, yeah.  They don't even have them anymore.  They used the portable CD players.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't need those anymore.  You got the MP3 players.  Now you got MP3 players, and now you have satellite.  It's just a matter of time before MP3...  Well, actually, I think some of the phones already have MP3 players, right?  Yeah, they do.  They use the iPods, right?  Instead of the MP...  Is that the same thing?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Well, you know the MP3...  No, no.  The MP3 player.  I listen to The Motley Crue on it.  It comes with a little needle. 
[01:39:00]  It's like a little record player.  There you go.  Ah, stop that needle.  You don't want it to skip when you move around.  MP3 player, like the mini-disc recorder player.  Let them talk.  Oh, my God.  A mini-disc.  Isn't that what that is?  Yes.  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  And the iPod is what you download songs.  Yeah, of course.  I bought one for my kid.  Right.  There you have it.  Yep.  I was listening to the Allman Brothers on the other night.  You bought something for your kid that's probably five years old.  An iPod?  Oh, you got the iPod.  Yeah, for my kid.  You're talking mini-disc, though.  Where did that come in?  They said, what, an MP3, a mini-disc?  Yeah, sure. 
[01:39:30]  I don't know what it is.  I don't listen to that crap.  I don't listen to, you know.  That crap.  I don't listen to that kind of stuff.  Who listens to music?  You get to a certain age, you stop listening to music.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  Who walks around listening to music?  Do any of you guys walk around?  I always listen to music.  I don't walk around it, but I always listen to it.  I'm an iPod in my coat right now.  What else?  What do you listen to?  Talk?  No, yeah, well, I listen to talk or...  You're an old codger.  No, he can't listen.  I don't need it.  He can't listen to music because he's got to make sure he hears the phone ring when Bonnie calls.  Oh, that's true.  He doesn't have time to be, you know, putting earbuds in his ears and listening to music off his iPod. 
[01:40:00]  And God forbid the phone rings and he doesn't answer it.  That music is a bunch of bunk.  That's the wrong one.  There it is.  Hi, Bonnie.  I was listening to my MP3 player.  And I thought I heard the phone ring.  Was that you?  My MP3 player is filled with all my mini discs.  Sorry, Bonnie. 
[01:40:30]  I had the Victrola on.  I didn't hear the phone ring.  What's that?  What?  Watson, come quick.  I need you.  What the hell was that?  Was that Bonnie?  This is why I don't listen to music.  I can't hear my poopsie call me.  What am I doing listening to these really long Allman Brothers songs?  Snookums.  I'm sorry.  I was halfway through in memory of Elizabeth Reed. 
[01:41:00]  And two hours had gone by.  I was the live version.  How's Bonnie?  She's great.  Yes, she is.  What did she do?  Oh, we were pitching a TV show the other day, right?  Really?  Together as a couple?  Well, I'm not just saying.  So, you know, they go, if it happens.  Nick and Jessica.  No.  She goes, they go, if it happens.  What?  I was just joking.  Oh, okay.  It really is like Nick and Jessica. 
[01:41:30]  No, I never even saw it, so I don't know what it is.  They go, if it happens, who would you want to direct it?  And she goes, I want Rob Fox from the first season of Last Comic Standing because he made  Tess look funny.  Oh.  And, you know, she's good in the meeting.  Very funny gal.  Very funny.  She's saying, very funny.  I just like the way your little hands move back and forth and you look like a midget accepting  a wedding proposal.  Oh.  You've got to see that. 
[01:42:00]  I still haven't seen it.  Oh, they're trying to hide her eyes like any normal, like what she'd seen in the movies  and they just keep hitting her little chin.  Oh, her chin.  She can't reach her eyes with those little T-Rex hands.  I believe it's on HBO On Demand or Showtime On Demand.  One of those On Demand.  You've got to see it.  What?  Funny as hell.  What's the matter, Rich?  I forgot.  He was ready to, he was so excited to say something.  He goes, oh, and then just stops.  Yeah, I know.  You lost confidence in it, didn't you?  Yeah, it's complete.  Yeah.  I love watching the loss of confidence happen, but it's even funny when it happens in the 
[01:42:30]  middle of the joke.  Yeah.  Because, you know, the thing is here, like if you know something's working, you guys don't  like, you know, you just attack.  I know.  It's like pit bulls.  Isn't it awful?  When DJs attack.  He's weak.  Right from the throat.  Oh, God.  A little weakness of blood.  It's over.  Let's go down to North Carolina.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, man.  I mean, I love y'all's show, but every time Vosk gets on there, it's a freaking screw-up.  He's a bumbling idiot, man, and mucus-filled, puff-secreting faggot.  He never says anything, man. 
[01:43:00]  He just sits there and starts the story, and you know it's bullshit from the time he opens  his mouth.  Yeah, they're all lies.  They're all lie stories.  What are you delivering now?  Excuse me?  What are you delivering?  You're in your car.  Delivering?  Yes.  I cannot hear you very well.  I'm actually not delivering anything.  I guess you did hear me, stupid.  He's delivering justice.  He's a police officer.  Oh, you're a police officer in North Carolina?  What's the crime where you live?  Somebody rings a doorbell and runs?  I can't hear him at all.  You can't hear him?  No, not at all. 
[01:43:30]  Why?  Sounds like he's in the background as opposed to being on the phone.  Yeah, that blows.  What are you doing, Bill?  Chasing those Duke boys?  There is a problem.  You've got to tell what's-his-name.  You know, when we do have a guest on that mic, they can't hear the phones.  That sucks.  Maybe he's investigating.  I understand that they-  Did you really say the Allman brothers?  Oh, he just stepped on.  Just stomped on.  Jim's in the middle of a joke on that cop from North Carolina, and Opie just trotting  on it, like through a daisy field, stomping. 
[01:44:00]  Was it a good one?  He was halfway through it.  I don't remember.  It wasn't like where you start and kind of, you know, you're tripping.  Jim was halfway through that game.  I told you.  He's roadkill today.  We're just going to keep-  That could have been one that got us into fifth gear.  That would have been a good one.  We're just going to keep running him over.  That's-  Wow.  I'm sorry.  That's right.  Oh, look at Opie's big footprint on your head.  I was distracted because we-  I feel like Charles Grodin in King Kong. 
[01:44:30]  I'm sorry.  What are you smelling yourself?  What are you smelling your armpits?  Are you stinky today?  No, not at all.  You know, someone want to know if you said, who are the Almond or Almond Brothers?  The Almond Brothers?  I didn't say the Almond.  I said the Almond Brothers.  Almond.  Almond?  The Walnut Brothers.  I didn't put a D on the end.  I said Almond.  Almond.  Yeah, the Almond Brothers.  All right.  I thought you might have had a D on the end.  He was hoping Rich said that.  And then Almond Brothers.  And then Spooge Demon from somethingawful.com. 
[01:45:00]  Oh.  Remember that website from Justin?  Part of the Cherry Darts thing?  He has a whole Scott Peterson mom thing here.  He does.  Yeah.  Hi, Scott.  It's mom.  Glad to hear you're giving up killing wives and unborn children.  But Dr. Phil says...  That's good.  Yeah.  Dr. Phil says when you get rid of your wife, you have to get rid of your little unborn son,  and Connor, too. 
[01:45:30]  You know, I worry about you with the cinder blocks and the rowboats.  And, you know, Dr. Phil says when a carcass washes up on shore, that you're fucked.  I miss you, Scott.  Daddy loves you.  We watch your movie, Pearl Harbor and Jiggly.  Come on.  We love it.  You don't think he looks like Ben Affleck?  Mommy thinks you look like Ben Affleck. 
[01:46:00]  She'll never go for three.  That's still good.  It's like I talk about North Carolina.  Every time I've been on, I've been funny.  I always bring something.  You know, enough already.  Rich gets very upset.  It's always about him.  He gets upset when people mock him on the...  Look at this.  Mike Ryan from Jersey.  Boss, clear your throat.  Are you a little phlegmy today?  No.  Which would be good for our little contestant.  You could work some into your schnoz and then pick it out.  Oh, he'll have a booger.  Do we have crackers today? 
[01:46:30]  Crackers?  Yeah.  What happened to the crackers?  We just need one saltine.  Well, you had that big bucket of crap yesterday you were eating out of.  Oh, yeah.  Doritos and party mix.  They're too salty.  They'll kill the booger taste.  It's got to be something bland.  That booger taste.  We'll figure it out.  All right.  I don't want the booger taste lost because a booger is salty.  Why don't we take a break and we'll give away the My Finex.  All right.  Let's do that.  Does that sound good?  Are you ready? 
[01:47:00]  You got your stuff?  Don't touch it yet.  I'm going to give you the weak one.  Don't touch it yet.  No weak one.  No rehearsal.  We don't need to know.  Well, it's not the weak one yourself.  No, this is not SNL.  You don't need a dresser.  Just do it when the man is here.  Do it.  Just save it and go for your all when he comes in.  All right.  Big finger full of custard.  All right.  We'll give away the My Finex.  Two guys getting kicked hard right in the crotch with no protection. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, that got him.  Oh, that got him.  If he wasn't chained up, he would have fallen down.  Oh, this is not right.  Oh, that's it.  That's got to be it.  That's got to be it.  Yeah, that's got to be it.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's see if we can't get a good kick in from Grandma.  Grandma is lining up. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, he's down.  He's down.  He's down.  You don't turn Grandma like that.  Come on.  She got the bullseye.  Grandma still got a chance, right?  Let's hear it for Grandma.  Grandma, put him down.  The very worst of the opiate Anthony F.U. Life.  Yeah, I want to leave a big ass view to a fucking zipper head that cut me off. 
[01:48:30]  Motherfucker, I pulled up next to him and his fucking expressionless face won't even fucking  turn around and look at me.  Oh, I do not see you.  I do not see you.  Fuck you.  Come on.  A big fuck you to everybody who's out there talking on their cell phones, driving.  When you see a fucking ambulance with their lights on and sirens blaring, don't pull out  in front of them.  It could be your family.  Okay?  Just fuck you.  Fuck everybody else.  You all need to go back to fucking driving school.  And another thing is don't fucking pull out in front of other people in the middle of an 
[01:49:00]  intersection.  Dicks.  You know, this is a general fuck you to everyone.  Just fuck you.  You know?  I don't want to tell anyone in particular to go fuck off.  Fuck everyone.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to give a big fuck you to me.  I think.  Who the fuck calls a goddamn phone line just to hopefully hear themselves on the fucking  radio the next day?  Fuck me.  You know what?  I just want to say fuck you to cancer for killing my cat. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, I'd like to give a big fuck you to the retard.  He fucking hurt my arm yesterday, and I didn't let him eat a bag of marbles he thought was  fucking candy.  Little fucker.  Also, fuck me for trying to help the retard that will never run out to anything more than  a fucking booger-eating, shit-smearing, duper-great motherfucker.  Fuck me.  You know what?  I'd like to give a big fuck you to my wife.  You know?  And I'm going to keep banging the 23-year-old, so fuck you, bitch.  Fuck you, you son of my fucking fuck. 
[01:50:00]  Anything you goddamn motherfuckin' does.  Yeah, I was gonna fuck you.  He, he, he, he.  Fuck all you.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU line 1.  1-866-FU line 1.  Well, fuck you very much.  They're practicing being cruel and unusual.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'm not going.  Black at your soul.  I'm not going to die.  You can try. 
[01:50:30]  I'm not going to die.  Black at your soul.  A big hi to everyone listening to us on their mini-discs.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  UConn, what's up, buddy?  Hey, man.  Hey, what do you got?  Hey, what's going on, man?  What's going on, Jimmy?  Hi, fella.  Hey, uh, O.P., you're being a little corporate bitch.  Ooh.  Wow.  Wow.  Harsh language.  Why?  A little corporate bitch?  Yeah, with this free play week, you just like being yourself. 
[01:51:00]  Am I right, Jimmy?  I don't know.  He seems like the same creep he's always been.  I don't see any difference.  I didn't hang up on him, by the way.  He's gone.  No, I'm not.  I just got to read this crap that it's a free play week, and if you want to continue listening  to the O.P. and Anthony Show, you got to add it to your XM account.  That's it.  You're selling out, man.  Man.  Call 1-800-XM radio or subscribe online.  You let the man infiltrate you, man.  Man.  Ooh, look at that fire.  Yeah, we've been watching the Chicago Fire on TV. 
[01:51:30]  They put this out yet?  Boy, they'll do anything to get people's minds off that basketball team they have out there.  True.  They haven't won a game yet.  They're doing really bad.  For the Bulls?  Yeah, they stink.  That was kind of a good line.  No, it wasn't.  It wasn't a bad line.  If I delivered it better and it had a better punchline, it would have been good.  It would have been good.  It had potential.  Ah, Rick, what's up?  Hey, Rick. 
[01:52:00]  We lost Rick.  Hello?  Hello?  Rick?  Oh, Greg.  Greg, Rick, whatever.  Oh, great.  Okay, I wasn't sure.  Okay.  Yeah, I was watching CNBC a couple minutes ago.  And Gary Parsons was on there talking about the stocks.  He can't stop eating.  It's just amazing.  Yes, go ahead.  And Toyota is going to be offering XM in 2006. 
[01:52:30]  Really?  Factory installed or?  Factory installed.  Where'd you hear that?  Or dealer options?  And no.  The key to satellite radio is the factory installed.  Yeah, and it's already in GM, of course.  Yeah.  Oh, we know.  And Honda this year.  Okay.  Well, we have to find out what that's about because that would be big news today.  Yes.  Well, he was on there for about 10 minutes, but I couldn't get through, so.  Okay, thank you.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, someone wants, maybe if you just put a condom on your finger, then the guy could  suck your finger.  I don't know if he could get, like, good. 
[01:53:00]  That's kind of a good idea.  No, it's not.  You know, we've got to get this MiFi thing out of the way because I think it's kind of  just slowing down the show a little bit.  I really do.  Why?  It could stay and we'll do other stuff.  Oh, okay.  We've got really racist music we're going to be playing in a little while.  It's called the Showstopper today.  You've got to go over there and do it.  Huh?  No, I'm just telling Rich you can't do it here because he won't be able to handle the show.  Oh, I'll freak out.  Oh, what's the big deal?  You should take a whiff.  I'll lose my mind.  I'll lose my mind up in here, up in here.  You're the only one that hasn't whiffed it.  Yes, I know.  I'm very proud.  Okay, why don't you take the weak ear? 
[01:53:30]  Take the weak ear.  No.  No.  Right here, the weak ear.  Come on, man.  No.  The reaction would be so great.  Smells like grape jelly.  No.  The reaction would be great.  The weak ear.  No.  Remember in the parking lot of the train station where we all took turns and I laughed so hard  that day.  People were puking, dry heaving, and everyone was taking their turn and while the one guy  is smelling what you've got behind your ear, everyone else was losing it because of the  reaction after they smelled. 
[01:54:00]  There is no way.  I can't believe I didn't do that after Hammerstein, bring someone on stage.  That would have been great.  Oh, yeah.  That would have been a good one.  All right.  So why don't we bring this guy in?  Where's Ben?  Ben doesn't want to be in the studio for this.  Oh, come on.  Oh, come on.  He gets real.  He gets real.  So what?  The boss wants him in here.  Yeah, no.  Ben's the executive producer.  Ben needs to be in here.  The boss wants him in here.  Believe me, I don't want to be in here for this.  What happened to this show?  Of course Ben has to...  What happened to taking one for the team?  The show lacks discipline.  We all used to take, you know, take stuff for the team. 
[01:54:30]  Ben, he's ignoring us.  He's at a computer.  What's in your luggage?  He's ignoring us?  Get in here.  Just get in here for a second.  I don't care if he'll throw up.  That's right.  He's got to at least explain himself.  He's got to stand in here because the boss wants him.  Do you guys understand how bad this is that Ben is like, no way, I'll throw up?  I'll throw up.  No, you won't.  Just live over there.  No, I've never been there.  That tight sweater will stop him from coming up.  The boss needs you here for executive producer decision here. 
[01:55:00]  Just stand over there.  No.  No.  Why?  I will puke on you, and then I'll puke on the ones that are puke.  On the ones you love?  You always puke.  I'll puke on Northern and Opium.  What's the problem?  I will throw up.  What is the problem?  I will throw up.  We don't have any more sushi.  Stay here.  Yeah, you're not going to throw up.  You're not smelling it?  Yeah.  Dude, I just...  Shut up.  Even watching it from the last time, I almost threw up.  The boss said you've got to stay here.  It's really not, Ben.  Come on, Ben.  Just have another chip.  Just hang out in the corner.  Just take what you're doing. 
[01:55:30]  Save one of the chips for the butter.  Yeah, which chip you want to put the butter on.  Is it going to go on a pretzel, a cheese doodle, a tortilla chip?  No.  I think it should go on a tortilla chip.  Ben just ran out again.  That's going to kill the smell.  Ben's leaving.  He's back at the computer.  That's going to kill the smell.  No Doritos.  That's easy.  How about a tortilla chip, then?  No.  Here.  Cracker.  I don't know.  There's salt on a saltine.  Take the salt off.  It's got to be something else.  I'm telling you.  How about a little piece of bread?  Is there anything...  What do you put in your mouth to get the salt taste out? 
[01:56:00]  What do you do?  Did you bring food, sir?  Yes.  It's for beefy fits.  Oh, what did you bring?  Thank you.  Talk on mic.  Yeah, get that mic.  Yeah, there's a new thing that Steve started.  If you come down to say hi to the program, you've got to bring food for some reason.  What the hell is...  And this has...  I heard something happening.  What is this, a morning show?  A what?  Oh, a whole Texas Hold'em poker set.  Nice.  Wow.  I'm re-wrapping this, giving this to somebody this Christmas.  Thank you.  This is perfect.  Let's take a look.  I want to look at the chips.  Because this might go flying if this isn't good, sir. 
[01:56:30]  No, those are good chips.  They're brand new.  It's got some weight to it.  I'll tell you that.  That's the old one.  Where does he hail from?  Oh, that's what he could...  New Jersey.  New Jersey, what's your name?  Paul.  Hey, Paul.  He could suck them off the chips.  Oh, yeah.  He should lick the boogers off a poker chip.  Oh, that'd be good.  That's right.  I'm a Texas Hold'em chip.  All right.  The poker chips look good.  They look pretty good.  They've got some weight to them, some thickness.  Not like that cheap crap that Broad bought.  Well, there they are, the famous chips.  Yes.  Maybe he should lick a booger off one of the old chips. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, look at that.  I like it.  I like it.  Joe in Philly, what's up?  Joe.  Yo, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Listen.  There's two DJs on NJ1015.  All right.  Their name is Craig and Rossi.  Yeah.  They use a lot of your shit, the ping pong, the silent, and they say, oh, no, no, no.  We're friends with our one night.  They let us do whatever we want.  Is this true?  Because these guys are sucking all your shit off.  Yeah.  I mean, I worked with Craig, and he's a really good guy.  I don't understand why he's got to do the stuff we do. 
[01:57:30]  Well, I just wanted to know, because it ain't right.  I don't understand that.  Well, we're friends, so it's cool.  No, it's not cool.  Do you know them guys?  It's Craig, who used to work at NAW, one of the sports guys.  Sports guys?  I've heard this a lot, that they're using the ping pong and a lot of the stuff that we  kind of started doing on our show.  The silent game all the time.  The silent game, even?  There's no reason.  All the time.  All the time.  And they always wait, and they go, I was wondering how long it was going to take for them to hang  up.  I'm like, oh, my God.  You got to be kidding.  Yeah. 
[01:58:00]  Well, they're just a couple of clones is what they are.  Yeah.  We are the Innovate, Robin.  All right.  So, what's your name again?  My name's Paul.  Paul.  Paul.  It has to happen over there.  It can't happen right here, because I can't smell.  At least I'm staying in the studio.  Oh.  Really?  You smell it.  You smell it.  I thought you were a fan of the odor.  Man, I'm afraid I'll just see you and stop this flow again.  Well, maybe you could transfer that prostitute addiction with my odor. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  So, for the MiFi, for the MiFi, Paul is going to smell.  I've got nothing.  What's behind Rich Voss's ear.  That comment really bugs him about the guy calling him.  I know.  Why do you like it?  I know.  They hate all of us.  I don't know.  You're the only one that takes it personally.  I know.  I'm sorry.  One guy.  I know.  But he's a cop in North Carolina.  He's a big guy.  Well, actually, there were a lot of guys.  But I figured he represented everybody.  So, don't worry about it. 
[01:59:00]  No.  Do you want to read the feedback?  It's not too pretty.  Well, what the hell?  No one's...  I'm doing...  What do you mean it's not too pretty?  I'm so kidding.  Would you shut up?  What am I supposed to do?  He's kidding.  Alvira, he's kidding.  One guy gets you.  It's amazing.  I was kidding.  All right.  All right.  You ought to listen to Bonnie, man.  You are an asshole.  All right.  So, who do we have in the studio?  Larry.  Pete.  Paul.  Oh, Paul.  Hey.  We'll do the tester here first, right?  You're going to let him smell the tester?  No. 
[01:59:30]  Why?  Okay.  No.  No!  No.  Hit him up with the real deal.  He's just got to get the full barrage.  But hold on.  Rich is ready to just shove it in his face.  Radio.  You've got to build some drama.  You know?  Where are you from, sir?  New Jersey.  He's from Jersey.  What a surprise.  Everyone that comes on to this show is from Jersey.  Jersey loves us.  Got to love Jersey.  Brick.  Ocean County.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And what do you do for a living?  Sell garden supplies. 
[02:00:00]  You sell garden supplies.  Yeah, I'm a loser.  What did you want to be when you were growing up?  I'd say a cop.  How old are you?  Oh, 22.  I love listening to kids talk.  I'm going to be an astronaut.  I'm going to be a movie star.  I'm going to be a pilot.  I'm going to be a pilot.  Fast forward 15 years.  The same kids working at the deli.  Gardening supply store.  Gardening supply store.  Used car salesman.  But all kids.  I'm going to be a professional baseball player. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, but you don't see the part where the uncle walks in the room and ruins that dream.  I have really nothing.  I swear to God.  Thank God for my ear.  Thank God.  I haven't had this left ear.  Your ear has become a crutch.  A ear full of stench.  I'm like Daniel Day-Lewis with my left ear.  Is that his name?  Was that his name?  Yes.  Was that his name?  Yes.  It was pretty funny, actually.  I don't know why we didn't laugh.  It was very funny.  I just wanted him to have back-to-back. 
[02:01:00]  Is that his name?  Well, because it was a good reference when it was funny.  But you guys, see, that's the problem.  You know what the problem is?  What?  If you don't laugh at a good one like that, then the people listening go, well, that's not funny.  Right.  Because they think that you've got to laugh in the studio.  Did you hear my omen line go down the toilet before when I did the bend girl hanging herself?  That was a great line.  No, but I just didn't...  No, no, the girl...  The what?  The flow.  Yeah.  I'm just kidding.  But see, I've had like five good lines, but you guys have no energy to me. 
[02:01:30]  You're not giving...  You had a lot of energy until I saw your face outside the studio.  No, I'm saying, you know...  Here comes the showstopper.  No, no, listen.  You haven't had five good lines.  Yes, I definitely did.  You had four.  I didn't say that confidently.  You did.  Okay, maybe four.  All right, we'll settle on three.  Stop negotiating.  Using his Jew bargaining technique.  Five lines.  Three lines.  Three lines.  Three lines.  Four.  Three, but you've got to give me two towards the next appearance. 
[02:02:00]  I'll gladly pay you two lines for an appearance today.  Oh, God, am I a fucking great character.  At least he's confident.  Well, I don't know if he's confident.  He's confident right now.  Wait for the next bomb and then see how not confident he is.  All right.  Now, do we know what we're doing here?  We got Rich.  He's going to get a finger full of that behind-the-ear stench. 
[02:02:30]  What he will do then is put it, wave it under your nose so you can smell it.  Not wave it, hold it.  Hold it, yeah.  What's his name?  Paul.  It will be like wafted, you know, so it wafts under his nose.  Hold it under his nose.  You've got to sniff.  He looks like Mr. Kaputnik's son from Mad Comic Books.  There's that line.  Wow.  That's not a bad...  First of all, his name is Roger Kaputnik, and he's a great character.  I don't even...  I don't recognize, but that's a very obscure reference. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, I read Mad growing up, and I could not possibly...  You don't remember Mr. Kaputnik?  Roger Kaputnik.  If he was an older guy with white hair, I might have recognized as Roger Kaputnik.  Yeah.  But the son?  If he had a son.  Does he look like the grown-up kid from Family Circus?  Yeah.  That's just a very obscure reference.  He looks like Dagwood Bumstead's third nephew from an abusive marriage he was involved in  before the cartoon.  Third panel, 1968, February 12th, New York Times. 
[02:03:30]  You look like a kid Beale Bailey molested.  Family Circus.  That could be the most obscure reference ever on this program.  Yeah, that was pretty obscure.  Oh, really?  Save that for the comic book invention.  You know what he looks like.  Private Pyle!  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  All right, well, you know what?  So it'll be wafted under his nose.  Can I say hi to Jim and Jersey first, though?  Oh, yeah?  Here we go.  Jim, go ahead.  Can't even get the rules out today.  I know.  Yo, listen, Voss is killing the show today. 
[02:04:00]  No, he's not.  Oh, he's killing the show today.  Get out of your mind.  He's a tackling little kid today.  I am.  Because it's funny.  There's funny stuff going on.  I can't help it.  When you hear funny stuff, you've got to laugh, man.  It's giving it back.  Let's see.  Voss makes Lady Di sound like Lenny Bruce.  Oh, Jesus.  I still read mad, and Voss is an idiot.  He finally has a great line, and he completely blows it.  Wow. 
[02:04:30]  Hey, Voss, you explained your jokes well.  Wow, I'm getting a lot of write-ins.  That's pretty good.  It is good.  They all know you.  I've got more write-ins than Nader.  Brad, what's up?  Yo, Voss there.  Yeah, Voss is here.  Jesus Christ, man.  You should have an overgrown pussy, Voss.  You won't let him suck on your finger,  nor could probably let him suck on his dick for five bucks.  Wait, say that again?  Well, no, he won't let him suck his finger.  I won't let him suck my finger.  What's wrong with you? 
[02:05:00]  God damn it, Voss.  What kind of pussy are you, anyhow?  It's just a finger, man.  Oh, you're saying I should let him suck my finger.  No.  Are you saying yes or no?  Yeah, I used to let him suck his finger, man.  Would you put your finger in a stranger's mouth?  Well, fuck, look at this shit.  It ain't like you're going to fight it or anything.  That's true.  It's not like you haven't done things like that before.  All right, so what's happening here today?  But I think Anthony's idea about wiping it right here so it lingers in his... 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, well, you've got to get a good smell first.  You've got to, like, breathe it in so you know what it smells like,  and that will make it that much more disgusting for him  when Voss then wipes it on his upper lip.  Mike doesn't care.  You don't think so?  No, he's right.  Do you care?  I saw you kind of grimacing.  Yeah?  Well, it's a two-parter for the mind-fi, so this is the first part.  So then he's going to wipe it on his upper lip,  which you must then immediately take your tongue and lick it off.  No, after I wipe it on his upper lip, 
[02:06:00]  if he sticks out his tongue, I'll scrape some of his tongue.  Oh, okay, yeah, stick your tongue out.  He'll wipe it on your tongue, and then you can clean your upper lip.  All right, that works.  Does that work?  Yeah, that works.  I just don't want to suck my finger because I might shoot a load of my pants.  And that would be really embarrassing.  Now, that's funny.  There it is.  Pop your finger in his mouth.  Hey.  Voss is back.  Voss is back.  Voss is back, everyone.  His eyes blinking rapidly.  I lay back, have a cigarette in the studio. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, man.  Like, for that moment, all shame of what was happening would just go away.  You're just coming.  All right, let's go.  Let's do this thing.  What is Ben doing out there?  I think Ben needs to be in here.  Ben does not want to be partying to this.  It's not cool that Ben's not in here for this.  I think, as the boss, sometimes you've got to put your foot down.  You think, I like getting up at 530, but no, siri.  It's what the show requires.  You're getting up at 530.  Nice.  Yeah, that's real nice.  533.  Thanks for the effort.  Hey, dude.  I was up at 315 today.  Well, you get the big bucks. 
[02:07:00]  I was out supplementing my income with a little stand-up comedy last night.  There you go.  All right.  Very good.  Let's do this thing.  You go to that.  You ask me whatever you want.  No, no.  It's about comedy.  Love you.  All right.  Rich, if you would take your position next to Paul.  You have to go on that side.  Paul from Jersey, right?  Paul from Jersey.  Okay.  He's a psychopath.  I can see Paul.  He's a psychopath.  Don't touch anything.  Now, make sure after you dig good in your ear, there's no delay, because the half-life  on this stuff is very quick.  Yeah, but I like when Voss smells it himself and has confidence in it going, oh, yeah. 
[02:07:30]  You want him to take a quick sniff first?  Yeah, because it's always funny.  Okay.  Here he goes.  He's rubbing now behind the ear.  Get a good one.  It's the worst ever.  He's dragging.  He's dragging.  He's dragging.  He's never disappointed.  Recharge it a little, Voss.  Recharge. 
[02:08:00]  He's never disappointed.  You can't fake that.  Now, wipe it.  Now, stick out your tongue.  Stick out your tongue.  He's puking.  Oh, God, he's puking.  Get your finger away from my coffee.  Oh, get it out of there.  Oh, my God, he's all red.  It won't go away.  It won't go away.  He can't take it.  His whole face is red. 
[02:08:30]  He tried to put his tongue out, and his body revolted and wouldn't let him put his tongue  out.  Did you see him heavey?  His body, like, shook.  He's still leaning over the garbage pail.  Voss is gagging.  Just smelt it himself.  Oh, my God.  This has been, I saved it up for a few days.  This never disappoints.  I still got more.  Yeah, get one of the interns to try it. 
[02:09:00]  Wow.  It's so interesting.  That.  Did he get it on his lip and all that?  Oh, yeah, he did it.  Yeah, it's on his lip.  That's why it won't go away.  What about the tongue?  He didn't get any on the tongue.  Did he?  He licked it.  No, he licked.  He tried to lick it.  Oh, he's puking.  Again.  He put his tongue out, and his tongue physically wouldn't do the act.  Did you see him shudder?  The whole...  Like, he shuddered with that heave.  Kev has no sense of smell.  No, Kev has no sense of smell.  Don't break through that. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, probably would break through that.  No, no, no, stop it.  No, I don't smell it from here.  Rich must stop it.  Rich must now be escorted to the bathroom where he must wash his hands.  Yeah, he's still got more.  More?  What the hell?  Is that a dumpster full back there?  Who hasn't smelled it yet?  All the interns have, unless there's somebody you want to punish.  I don't know.  No, they've all been working their asses off.  They're all very good interns.  They're great.  How about Master Poe?  Has he smelled it?  No, because Master Poe will just twist off the offending digit. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, my God.  That never, ever disappoints.  I don't know what it is.  It never, ever disappoints.  All right, relax, Master Poe.  How about Nathaniel?  He hasn't done it.  He took some.  He did.  Did he?  Well, did he?  I can make a deal with Nathaniel.  We have his comedy tape.  I'm sure he'd like some exposure today on the radio program.  Nathaniel, please come in.  Doesn't it violate you as a human?  Wait, get him on the mic.  What, what, Paul?  Hold on, you're going to Nathaniel first.  Oh, no, we'll go to Paul first. 
[02:10:30]  Paul, what does that smell like?  Dev, get right on the mic, please.  The most rotten pussy you could ever think of.  Oh.  Yeah, everyone describes it differently.  No.  It's something like rancid meat.  I don't have confidence.  Rancid meat and, like, old cheese.  Yeah.  I didn't have confidence in it today.  I just thought it wasn't going to happen.  I didn't think we were going to get the reaction.  Oh, my God.  That was, like.  But it never disappoints.  I have to have confidence in this every time.  Yeah, every time.  Because it just seems like such a stupid thing.  But I'm telling you.  He turned, like, beet red. 
[02:11:00]  And started heaving into the...  He tried to lick it.  His body wouldn't...  His tongue wouldn't do it.  Wouldn't allow it.  No.  My tongue won't allow it.  All right.  Well, hold on a minute.  Wow.  Leslie's not happy with us whatsoever.  Leslie, what's up?  Dude, no booger.  No more.  No more ear.  No more booger.  Booger.  Booger.  Booger.  Oh.  Stand over there.  I can't take it.  I cannot take it. 
[02:11:30]  All right.  Well, if you don't want to hear Paul eat one of the boss's horrendous boogers...  He doesn't deserve that.  Shut up.  He's getting almost a $400 thing.  Yeah, of course.  I'm taking that for free.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't care.  All right.  Leslie, you might want to...  No, get away from me.  You might want to turn off the program for five minutes.  All right.  Thank you, Leslie.  Goodbye.  All right.  Ref, it looks like, in Maryland.  Ref.  Ref.  Ref.  Ref.  Ref.  Will you stop walking around and waving your finger like a weapon? 
[02:12:00]  Is that about Reef?  Reef?  All right.  Whatever.  What's up, Reef?  Hey, you can't make this poor guy eat a booger after getting a dirty boss.  You can, because I've gotten a boss.  And you know what?  Rules are rules.  Rules are rules.  That's right.  I don't have any.  Hold on.  Wait.  We've got to get Nate.  Try to get Nathaniel some.  Nate.  Nate.  Nate.  I'll tell you what I've got left still.  Nate.  Nate.  Can you stop walking around with that finger?  Nathaniel, our intern, he's a comic, Anthony.  Yes.  Yes.  Up and coming comic. 
[02:12:30]  What are you doing, though?  No, no.  Don't do it yet.  Hold on.  And he brought in a tape.  He performed at Caroline's last night, and I'm sure he would like a little exposure today.  But I think he's going to have to do the boss thing first.  But why do you want to wipe it on something, Rich?  I have to.  Just to tell you how much I had.  But put it.  Do it then with your finger under his nose so he can smell it.  You've got to get a good.  There's a lot, huh?  We've got to.  Well, get out, Mike.  We can't hear you.  It's snorting from your nose.  It's meaty.  It's meaty? 
[02:13:00]  All right.  Oh, he's taking it like a man.  Nothing?  Oh, he's good.  I think once my cherry's been popped on this, it's just...  Really?  He already smelled it.  Wow.  What?  Oh, my God.  Look at the CD.  He's lighting it on the CD.  And you can just see the big smear of...  Oh, my God.  ...gook.  Get away from me.  All right.  We see it.  Get away.  You're awful.  You're an awful man.  Get that away.  I'll throw that out. 
[02:13:30]  Sell it on eBay.  Watch this.  Toxic waste.  Oh, my...  Serious DNA right there.  Nathaniel took that.  I can't believe it.  You took that like a champ.  Well, we all know it does wear off after that.  We have learned...  Not that much.  We have learned, though, yet...  No, it wears off pretty fast.  The first hit is usually the worst.  It's usually the worst, right?  I think the whole studio is starting to smell.  Holy shit.  I think the whole studio is starting to stink.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to throw it.  It smells like cheese in an asshole. 
[02:14:00]  Get away.  Throw that away.  Throw that disc out.  Throw it out.  Florentine goes to Bonnie.  Have you smelled this here?  And she goes, here.  He goes, what are you doing?  She goes, I blew him.  Get out of here, dude.  Yeah, throw that away.  Oh, you're just the worst person.  Go put that...  No, I don't...  Throw that away.  It's in the garbage right there.  Go put it by Ben.  Oh, you don't want to waste that.  Shut up.  Go put that by Ben.  Tell him you want to queue it up.  Make him carry it.  Say that.  That's a collector's item right there.  Yeah, throw that on eBay.  Throw that on eBay. 
[02:14:30]  What disc was that?  That he ruined completely forever.  This is my stand-up.  This is my stand-up last night.  That's your stand-up?  No, I was kidding.  No, no, no.  Go put that...  Go, go, uh...  Throw it away!  Where do you want me to put it?  What's the thing?  Ben, Ben, that garbage pail.  No, you can't...  Put it in the fucking garbage pail.  Jam.  It puts the stink dish...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  ...disc in the pail.  I can't even speak.  Yeah, we got to play that for the people that are checking us out for free this week.  We'll do that in a minute or two.  What about the booger?  No, I don't have any.  You don't have any boogers?  Uh-uh.  So do I get a Mi-Fi too then? 
[02:15:00]  Awesome.  No, you get your comedy plan.  Oh, yeah, cool.  No, I got nothing.  You have nothing?  No, because ever since I used that nose trimmer, nothing's getting caught up.  All right.  Well, we'll figure it out.  So far, uh...  Paul's got a Mi-Fi.  Yeah.  It's horrifying.  That's enough.  The video's hilarious.  Oh, that bitch is digging in his nose.  Oh, God.  I hate seeing people pick their nose.  You told me to.  Can you go wash your hands in a fucking...  What are you doing?  Oh, God.  Dude, it's disgusting here.  Oh, that was funny, though, man. 
[02:15:30]  Paul dry heaving.  Did you actually puke, or was it more dry heaving?  He came up and went back down.  Rich, what are you doing?  I'm sorry.  Just go wash your hands.  Go wash your hands.  You gotta wash.  Gotta wash.  All right.  Well, we'll play Nathaniel's comedy table a little bit.  You took him.  What can I tell you?  Rich is going out.  It wasn't the reaction we wanted, but we'd rather have a real reaction than something fake.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  So there you go.  He took it.  It does wear away a little bit.  Yeah.  Not that much.  One more little spray of Lysol.  Okay.  Because, uh...  And you want to, um...  You want to do this or no? 
[02:16:00]  That reek.  I'm a fan, right?  I see where you are.  Oh.  Oh, sure.  You ready right now?  Sure.  Why not?  All right.  A little surprise for everybody.  Haven't done this in a while.  Right?  No, we haven't.  And, uh, we can't tell you what it is because we want to get it done before anyone gets in  trouble, right?  Uh-huh.  We've done it in the past.  So let's go to Sex Bagel out on the streets of New York City.  Sex Bagel!  Hey, guys.  I'm out here in the cold, pouring rain with a bunch of Tony Danza fans here.  We have Tina from Philadelphia, who is a massive Tony Danza fan. 
[02:16:30]  She would love nothing more than to speak to Tony.  Oh, that's wonderful.  All right.  Um, I think Tony Danza's ready here.  Hello?  Hello?  I think we're ready for Tina.  Okay.  Hang on one second.  Okay.  Here you go. 
[02:17:00]  Hello?  Tina.  Hi, Tony.  How are you?  Hey, how you doing, Tina?  Good.  We love you so much.  There's eight of us.  You came all the way from Philadelphia to see you.  Philadelphia.  Philadelphia.  Hey.  Your grandmother came.  Hey, you know, I'm doing very well in Philadelphia.  That's great.  The show, uh, taking off.  Getting married.  I am so very excited.  I wanted to hear your CD.  I wanted to purchase one.  Oh, you like that?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I loved singing for so many years.  And, uh, you know, God bless. 
[02:17:30]  I've been able to pursue that now and put out a CD.  Oh, that's great.  I was a big fan of Who's the Boss.  Oh, Who's the Boss.  And, uh, of course, that other show I was on.  But I still love you.  You're so haughty.  Oh, does that mean Tony might get lucky?  Yeah.  Oh, you can't wait to come into the show.  Right.  And, uh, and see.  How do you think I'm doing as a talk show host? 
[02:18:00]  Huh?  How do you think I'm doing as a talk show host?  You're doing good.  You're doing great.  Uh, yeah, I don't look like a complete buffoon up there.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  You know, because I'm pretty stupid.  No, you're not.  But you're funny.  It's kind of, you're funny.  It's a great show.  Hey, you watch the reruns of Taxi?  Huh?  You watch the reruns of Taxi?  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  When I was a young guy, you know, my mule was all hard.  Definitely.  And that little, the little guy, uh, what the, uh, uh, uh, the, uh, uh, uh. 
[02:18:30]  Danny DeVito.  Danny DeVito.  Danny DeVito, Danny DeVito, a good friend of mine, Danny DeVito, yeah, he used to make  us laugh so much, he'd come in, and after a night out banging whores, he'd go, smell 
[02:19:00]  my finger, oh, a little too risque, I understand, but, and then he, you know, the guy that would  fix the cars, you know, I kind of forget, I'm getting old in my old age, Latka, he would 
[02:19:30]  come in after banging whores and say, smell my mule, yeah, that's great, I'm so excited  to see you, you know, it's like Dr. Phil says, you know, when you give something up, you  got to replace it with something else, right, you know, you understand that, right, oh, I  completely understand it, yeah, so, how long before they let you in, I don't know, we're  still waiting, hey, do you know who's on the show today, no, uh-oh, I was hoping you'd 
[02:20:00]  tell me, they don't tell me until the last minute, oh, really, oh, my God, yeah, we  don't know who's on the show today, hey, how big of a Tony Danza fan are you?  I'm a big fan, a big, big fan, I'm a huge fan, we're all huge fans, we have eight people,  yeah, um, that's not your CD, excuse me, could you give me a CD? 
[02:20:30]  I will personally give you a CD after the show, as a matter of fact, as a matter of  fact, if you, uh, let my, uh, my person on the scene there, Eric, know, uh, where you're  sitting, uh, how would, how would you like to come backstage after the show and, uh, hang  out with Tony?  I would love it, I have, I have eight people with me, can they come too?  They could all come backstage, but, you know, there's a little trade-off. 
[02:21:00]  Here, you know, a little trade-off, I do for you, you do for Tony Danza, all right, do  you understand?  I completely understand, we love him, hello?  Here we go again, hello?  Do you, do you know the kind of favor Tony needs?  You know, it's, it's pretty, uh, a lot of high pressure, uh, doing a show, uh, every day  like this, you, you understand?  I completely understand.  And, uh, I need to relax a little bit, you know, I need to relax, I used to have to 
[02:21:30]  relax on a set of taxi, and who's the boss, and, uh, there were people that would help,  uh, me relax.  Maybe you could help me relax a little bit, is what I'm saying.  I'll, I'll help you relax.  You know, maybe a little back rub?  Definitely.  Would you like to give me a back rub?  I sure will.  Maybe a little front rub?  Oh, my God.  Are you married?  Yeah, I'm getting married in March.  Yeah, well, I'll try to put a stop to that, huh? 
[02:22:00]  Hey, you keep your husband happy, huh?  Yeah, definitely.  Hey, you want to do me a favor?  Sure.  When I'm doing my, uh, my monologue at the beginning of the show, would you come up on  stage and give me a kiss?  Oh, I sure will.  I would love it.  You know, I'm starting a new segment on, on the program, and I like having a, a lovely  young lady, uh, come out on stage and give me a little peck on the cheek. 
[02:22:30]  I would be honored to.  I would definitely be honored to.  Now, uh, we need, we need a good, a good time, uh, for you to come out.  Okay.  And give me that little kiss on the cheek.  Okay, definitely.  Now, as soon as I walk out.  Okay.  I'll walk out on a stage.  Okay.  And I want you to, you know, the, the audience is applauding because I'm a Tony dancer. 
[02:23:00]  Uh-huh.  And you, uh, you come out and, uh, I'll be like, oh, here's someone from the crowd.  And just, uh, say, I love you, Tony, and give me a kiss on the cheek.  Oh, that'd be awesome.  And then you go back to your seat and I'll give you a CD and you come back and give me  a massage.  Thank you very much.  Absolutely.  I'm so excited.  And so am I.  Thank you.  I won't ruin it by saying anything else.  All right.  I look forward to seeing you on stage at the beginning of the show. 
[02:23:30]  I sure will.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you very much.  God bless.  Thank you very much.  God bless you, too.  Bye-bye.  Hey, guys.  Eric.  Hey, um, we have the head of security here.  He's right next to me.  He wants to confirm that, uh, we're, this isn't the Opie and Anthony show, that it's really  Z-100.  Um, yeah, sure.  Okay.  Hang on one second.  All right.  Uh, we have somebody from the company who wants to, if you want to confirm it.  Oh, you didn't have a mayor. 
[02:24:00]  Uh-oh.  Well.  Their problem?  Sounds like somebody's onto this.  Oops.  I knew it.  I knew it was too good to be true.  Someone from the show knows the deal now.  That stinks.  Oh.  Well, I'm still going to have to watch today, and hopefully they won't talk to that woman.  Yeah, they'll talk right to her.  Do you think?  Yeah.  This is how we'll get it done.  I don't know.  Maybe Eric kept her away from the girl I was talking to.  Who knows?  I don't know.  Boy, they always think it's Tony. 
[02:24:30]  They're so happy to talk to that big, dumb bastard.  Your impression's phenomenal, though.  I think it's Tony, and I'm looking at you.  Big dumbass.  Eric's all nervous.  He's down there in his fake Tony Danza t-shirt.  Is he wearing a fake Tony Danza t-shirt?  Yeah.  Yeah, he went down there with it.  We actually had t-shirts made up.  Let's say Tony Danza Show staff.  Yeah.  He's got a Tony Danza staff t-shirt, a jacket, a hat.  Oh, yeah.  We go all out for our bits. 
[02:25:00]  We do it enough.  One of these days, it's going to happen.  They probably make an announcement before the show.  If Tony spoke with you on the phone, don't come running out on the stage, okay?  You fucking roost.  Come out and give me a kiss on my car.  Duh.  Oh, wow.  She was very happy to talk with Tony. 
[02:25:30]  You may have to just be vicious from now on, then.  If it's never going to get on stage, you may just have to keep smashing them with filth.  I know.  You know what's really funny?  She doesn't...  I'm talking to her, and I bring up that Dr. Phil said, you know, if you give something  up, you've got to replace it with something.  You understand?  And she's like, oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, she's just so thrilled to talk with this idiot that she doesn't care what he's  saying.  She's just agreeing with it.  She's agreeing with anything.  We're trying to get Eric back on the line, but...  Where'd he go?  So... 
[02:26:00]  Ben's laughing.  Ben, you can come back in.  The boss thing's over.  Jesus.  Why is Ben cackling?  I don't know, but he's got something to say.  He's in an outbreak suit, Ben.  He's just afraid.  He's being...  They're threatening to arrest him.  What?  Disorderly conduct.  How is that disorderly conduct?  He's the most orderly guy ever.  Then they grabbed his phone or something.  They grabbed his phone.  Grabbed his phone.  What?  Is this going to be the first person arrested on the new Opie and Anthony show?  Eric.  Why can't I fucking do it? 
[02:26:30]  Hello?  Hey, what's up, Eric?  Yeah, they're not letting me leave.  They're threatening to arrest me here for disheartening and ruining their show.  Eric, run away.  They're not cops.  Leave right now.  Run.  Hello?  Oh, they got it again.  Just run away.  He's got to just run.  They don't understand.  People don't understand.  If they're not cops, you can flee.  Yeah.  Run away.  Oh, Eric's going to get arrested now.  Eric's going to get arrested because he's not running away. 
[02:27:00]  Like stupid Mercurio.  Run away.  Run.  Run.  Run.  They're not cops.  You can run from Danza security.  They're not going to put an APB.  Hey, call in all cars.  Call in all cars.  Look for a cute little chubby boy with frosted hair.  Car 54, where are you?  Whoa.  It's the Danza police.  The Danza police.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Are you kidding me?  I thought we were pretty sneaky today. 
[02:27:30]  They've been just waiting for us, huh?  Pull over.  Who's the boss?  I'm the boss.  Don't make a move.  Drop the cell phone.  Well, someone has to get down there.  Oh, he's got to run.  I'll give Ben all the numbers for the record label guy.  So, I'll go down there.  Disturb?  What is it?  Disorderly conduct?  That was the most orderly call ever.  Danny's good.  Danny, go run down there with a cell phone.  Don't get caught and tell us what the hell's going on.  Because they took us...  Oh, wait.  Is he back?  Who's this? 
[02:28:00]  Hey, it's Eric.  All right, what's going on?  The guy keeps smacking the phone out of my hand and closing it.  He's like, I don't give a fuck who you're talking to.  He's like, if you...  And he's sitting here trying to take a picture and everything.  Just walk away, stupid.  I've been trying to, but the guy won't let me fucking get me, guy.  What, is he holding on to you?  Yeah.  He's not allowed to hold you.  That's assault.  Punch him in the face.  Punch him in the friggin' nuts.  I have an idea for you.  I said, no, I just took a cab here.  And he said, well, how would you want to bet if I go through you, you got a while? 
[02:28:30]  I said, you can't go through me.  I don't know who the fuck you are.  You're not a cop.  He's not a cop.  Run away.  I'm trying to.  Break loose and run.  Break loose.  Break loose.  Use one of those...  Unbelievable.  Use a master...  Data security can't tell him not to be on the floor.  They can.  And you can talk to anybody online.  Is our guy going to get arrested with a fake Tony Danza?  You can talk to anybody online with a fake...  You don't want to be at the tombs with a Tony Danza show t-shirt on. 
[02:29:00]  All right, well...  Hey, my thoughts and prayers are with Eric.  You know, Danny can handle this, because we need you for the next segment.  Can Danny handle this, though, or should Steve go?  No, Danny can handle this.  He's good.  Just tell Danny to run there with the phone.  All right.  All right?  I got Steve's strategy.  Steve will go there.  They'll be upset.  Pull the fire alarms, because they'll see a blaze.  And he'll be able to make good his escape.  Yeah, you weren't in Chicago overnight, were you?  No.  No, sorry.  I saw some of your clothes flying out a window, doing a little office work at night. 
[02:29:30]  How can this head of security smack his phone?  Who the fuck is this guy?  Tony Danza's security.  He's a bully.  That's all he is.  He's intimidating.  He's probably...  He's huge.  I bet he's a huge black guy that just thinks he can intimidate the shit out of Eric.  And Eric's scared.  Wow.  Send me after Poe.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what?  We really should.  We should send Poe down there.  Send Poe down there.  Oh.  Spin kick the sun.  Go in and just kick ass on the Danza set.  No, but you know what?  If Eric is going to be hassled physically, you can't have that.  It can't happen to him.  No.  The guy could be arrested for assault right there, just holding him. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, you could just grab him.  Just grabbing him.  He could be knocking the cell phone out of his...  Absolutely not.  You don't bother to go online and interview or talk to anybody you want.  There's no security guy on a sidewalk.  Well, what is...  Can better somebody get Billy Mac or one of those guys on the phone?  Billy Mac.  He's Billy Mac.  Master Poe.  What's wrong?  Eric's in trouble?  Yeah, one of our guys is in trouble.  Yeah.  No bullshit.  He's online with Tony Ganda thing.  He's getting arrested.  The head of security...  He was just on the phone.  He wasn't doing anything.  And the head of security is like... 
[02:30:30]  Every time he tried to call the show, the head of security won't let him go.  And he keeps smacking his phone.  What exactly did he do?  On the phone.  Just with the phone.  Interviewing somebody on the line.  Okay.  This just in?  He got away?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, good.  Of course.  Is he running?  Yeah, he's running.  I just told him I'm running in the middle of traffic.  Just running.  You could lose him.  What did they do to him?  Oh, I don't know.  Nothing.  Now you're right away.  They knocked the cell phone out of his hand.  Right.  We'll get the full report when Eric gets back here.  Getting in contact with Keith.  You can't do that.  You're holding him.  No, you can't do that.  That's against the law. 
[02:31:00]  You can't smack anything out of anyone.  When Sex Bagel gets back, we'll find out exactly what happened.  Dude, I really think that if he smacked the phone out of his hands, Eric should file a report.  Exactly.  There's nothing illegal about interviewing somebody on a line.  Of course not.  Why do we have to deal with cops again?  Twice already?  It's not against the law.  No.  Eric's not a disorderly guy.  It's not against the law.  Maybe he can get free tickets for Tony.  And he's a nice guy.  He did nothing.  Oh, my God.  Master Poe's going to lose his mind.  Look at him.  Breathe.  He's taking the legal road.  Breathe. 
[02:31:30]  Don't some breeze, Poe.  Breathe.  We've got to get some boards in here that you can break when you just get pissed off.  We should contact Keith because, honestly...  Well, we'll find out.  As soon as Eric gets here.  That's wrong.  Yeah, it's wrong.  I hope he's ditching the Tony Danza t-shirt where Master Poe ditched the bloody gee.  The bloody gee in a dumpster?  That'd work.  Ditch the evidence.  Eric, if you're listening to us, ditch the evidence.  How is he listening to you?  He doesn't have...  Maybe he hasn't lost his ear.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, we'll find out what happens when he gets here, okay?  Okay.  All right, Poe.  Breathe. 
[02:32:00]  Breathe for us, okay?  Poe's very pissed off.  Eric running down the street.  Cure Mom's phone!  All right.  He got the word in.  Great.  Man, they've been waiting for us.  We've been wondering.  We were being set up.  We were being lulled into a false sense of security.  You heard how sneaky we were.  We didn't tell anyone.  We just went to it real fast.  He's there with the dopey shirt on.  You know that pissed them off.  Too bad.  It's not illegal.  You can wear whatever the hell you want.  This is the Tony Danza show.  But why they ask if you were the other radio station?  I guess it's okay if Z100 does it, but not us. 
[02:32:30]  Because Z100 isn't going to say things like Tony needs his cock sucked.  I think it might have been what I was gathering there.  They think Eric was saying he was with the Opie and Anthony show,  but he was really with Z100,  so they wanted to know who was really at the bottom of this  so they could get them in trouble.  So they were trying to get Z100 in trouble,  thinking it was Z100.  That's what I think.  There you go.  You don't know?  Maybe.  No, you might.  I don't think they have a relationship with the Z100. 
[02:33:00]  They may have gotten with it.  I think they thought Eric was lying and saying it was Opie and Anthony.  I think Eric panicked and said, I'm with Z100.  Oh, you think Eric did that?  Of course he did.  Or a misrepresentation of himself.  Would you say you were with Opie and Anthony on the line?  He probably just went,  they probably went,  who are you here with?  You know, some dude.  Oh, Z100.  Yeah, he does do that to get out of trouble.  Oh, yeah, and he figures out what's the faggiest radio station,  so maybe they'll have some sympathy for me.  I'd love to find out what that scumbag security guard  bullying a little blonde boy.  Put the effing lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket. 
[02:33:30]  For the people that are listening to us for free this week.  Yes, this is from the musical,  Silence of the Lambs.  Oh, you didn't know there was a musical?  Well, there isn't really.  A couple of guys in California threw it together.  The Kaplan Brothers.  The Kaplan Brothers?  The Kaplan Brothers.  Very talented.  They made a whole musical out of Silence of the Lambs.  And this is one of the songs.  Put the effing lotion in the basket.  It's one of our faves.  And when we get back, I think Eric will be here.  He could run pretty fast, right?  It's not that far away.  We'll talk to Eric next. 
[02:34:00]  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  Or else it gets the hose.  And when it's done, there's one more thing.  A simple little task.  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  Helps me not to think of them as human. 
[02:34:30]  So I call them it instead of by their names.  Mister, please, no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  I'll starve you so your skin gets loose.  Stop drying out your bitch fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote. 
[02:35:00]  I'm in Korea's doll.  You're silly whining.  So I'm down before I jam them off.  I'm down your fucking throat.  Mister, please, my mom's got money.  Let me go.  This isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose.  Don't be a dummy.  Listen to your screaming whale.  Keep it down, you fucking whale.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The west girl climbed halfway but failed. 
[02:35:30]  I'm down here, you piece of shit.  I'm down here, you piece of shit.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I'd kill you up.  There's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and choose you. 
[02:36:00]  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell fat girls in a fucking store.  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend.  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you.  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  Hey, you ungrateful brine shrimp. 
[02:36:30]  This is Greg Proops, your old pal.  The one with glasses on whose line is it anyway.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  As if you had something better to do.  I've got stupid in stereo.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All hell has broken...  Wow, that was real loud.  I had to stop.  All hell has broken loose on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:37:00]  We're in the middle of our free play.  Our free play week.  Actually, not the middle.  I guess halfway through tomorrow's show would be the middle, I guess.  Ernie from Nebraska.  What's up, Ernie?  I just started to see you yesterday.  You've got a cool show going there.  Oh, thank you, Ernie.  Thank you.  Are you going to sign up or what?  Are you going to pay the two bucks?  Yep, sure am.  Are you going to show us a little love?  Oh, look at that.  We've got a customer.  That's what we need to do.  One at a time.  Keep that checkbook away until January 1st, Ernie, because it's free for the rest of 
[02:37:30]  the year.  All right, Ernie.  Thank you.  Yeah, if you're liking what you're hearing, you could add us to your XM account, Opie and  Anthony, channel 202.  You call 1-800-XM-RADIO or subscribe online.  You know what the nice thing about this giveaway for the rest of the month is?  That money that you were going to put into getting the Opie and Anthony Show, use that towards  Christmas gifts.  All right.  Don't worry about paying for this show until January 1st.  Use that money for something else.  It's a savings of at least a buck. 
[02:38:00]  A buck something.  Maybe a buck something, Opie.  A buck something.  Attaboy.  Makes a great stocking stuffer.  More than a buck, less than two bucks.  Phone call.  All right.  So, Anthony, wow.  Eric is on his way back to the station.  Yeah.  He's a little chubby or he'd be here by now.  He's running.  Oh, he needs to work out a little.  Maybe tone up.  A little tone up would be nice.  Maybe he can replace one line with another line.  To the Nagels listening in Florida, don't worry.  Your son did not get arrested yet.  No, he's fine. 
[02:38:30]  He had a call up twice for us to tell him to run, though, which gets me.  I'm going to have a briefing with some of these people, Opie, because the prime rule for  anyone out and about that is involved with this show on the street ever, ever, ever.  Is to make sure you get arrested so we get the publicity?  Well, yeah.  That's the real thing.  But we can't really say that.  The official line, we tell them, is to run.  Or just walk away fast.  They can't grab you for something like that.  No.  But apparently, the security guard at the Tony Danza show grabbed Eric.  They were on to us. 
[02:39:00]  And was holding him, saying that the cops had been called, and that he was holding him  there, bodily.  And that would grab his cell phone or smack his cell phone out of his hand.  This constitutes assault, Opie.  Now, here's the problem.  If the cops were called, then the cops will be here.  Because now they have to get to the bottom of it.  Good.  Let them.  Eric can call whoever he wants.  Do you think New York's finest is going to take the time out to come down here after  they talk to a Danza security guard and find out that nothing was happening? 
[02:39:30]  Danny.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Danny.  I just got to the line.  There's no sign of Eric.  But there is a big PC security guard I could probably talk to.  All right.  Yeah.  Ask him where Eric went.  All right.  Hold on.  Wait.  We can't get our internet.  Wait.  Wait.  Danny.  Yeah.  Should we do that?  He just wants to ask him.  But maybe we should hear from Eric first.  Yeah.  Why don't you just ask the security guard what happened to the Eric guy?  The guy from G100.  The guy from...  Hey.  Was there a guy here named Eric? 
[02:40:00]  No.  Because I'm looking for him.  I don't see him.  I was just wondering if you might know where he is.  He was interviewing the Tony Danza audience member.  He has no idea where Eric might be.  All right.  I wonder if that's the same guy.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It could be a different guy.  Okay.  I'm peeking into the windows looking for him inside.  No.  Danny.  Eric ran away.  He did run away?  Yeah.  He ran away.  He made like a banana and split.  Yes.  All right.  Cool.  All right. 
[02:40:30]  Thank you.  He ran like Bobby De Niro from a Norton photo op.  Oh, God.  That hurts.  Thank you.  Chief Shee from New York.  Did he say that?  Yes.  I'm not going to say that.  Call it.  I want to see where he is.  We want to...  Ben Alp wants Eric on the phone.  Get all the details.  So, we've been doing this Tony Danza thing off and on for...  Well, I guess that's only the third time, right?  Yeah.  That's only the third.  Is my mic lower again?  I don't know.  Eric ran, man.  Somebody held Steve Shee's hat under his ass.  There we go. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  From time to time, we go out to the Tony Danza line as they're filing in to see that stupid  show.  And Anthony does a great Tony Danza impression.  And we have a little fun with it.  And we have fun with the rubes that are waiting to see Tony Danza.  Plus, they're all rubes on that line.  And they buy it every single time.  Every single time.  All happy to talk to Tony.  We haven't been tripped up once.  Do we have, like, the other one all queued up?  Maybe we can play this and by the time this ends, Eric will be in studio.  How does that sound?  This was the dirty one.  This is the dirty version?  Yeah, this is pretty funny, though. 
[02:41:30]  So, you know, finally today they were on to us and they caught us.  And I don't know what's going to happen.  Because they were trying to hold Eric there, the security guard.  And supposedly the cops were called.  I bet they had a big meeting about this a while back.  And they were all psyched that it was happening today.  Probably on the walkie-talkies.  It's going down.  It's going down on the line.  He's out there.  He's out there.  Code blue.  Code blue.  He's on the line.  Big meeting.  All right.  If it happens again, I want some fucking heads busted.  Yeah, you know how he... 
[02:42:00]  Like Dan's in there with a baseball bat.  I guarantee that's how he talks when he's not on his show.  These fucking pricks fuck with my show again.  I want some blood on that fucking sidewalk.  You hear me?  I ain't the nice fucking Danzy here today, pal.  It's all nasty.  Like when they take the guy back at the casino and he's been cheating.  Oh, in The Cooler?  What was that?  No, no.  I think...  What movie was that?  Casino.  Casino.  And they take the guys that were cheating in the back. 
[02:42:30]  You could have the money or your hand.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was also in The Cooler.  Yeah, they had a scene like that in The Cooler.  Yeah, but Casino's bigger.  And it's Tony Danza.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, why don't you come back here, huh?  You don't fuck with Danza.  I'll give you the fucking Danza.  No thoughts and prayers to this scumbag.  Thoughts and prayers to your face when it hits the curb.  We'll get someone.  Huh?  It'll happen.  Oh, it'll happen.  We'll get you.  We'll get you.  I don't know why we're so crazy obsessed with you. 
[02:43:00]  Why are we?  Because its awfulness is so unbelievable.  The only thing I've actually liked about Danza is that he's not a complete smooth talk show host,  which I do kind of dig about him, but he's just such a boob.  All right.  Well, why don't we play another one of these Tony Danza pranks as we wait for Eric to come back into the studio,  and then we'll find out what happened today, okay?  All righty.  Yeah, this is the dirtiest one I think Anthony did.  Check this out.  Well, Anthony, we've got Sex Bagel on the line.  We don't want to say where he is because it could ruin what we're about to do. 
[02:43:30]  What's his name?  It's not up there.  Sex Bagel.  He works for us.  Who?  Eric.  He works on the show.  Oh, Eric?  Yeah.  You know, Eric.  I didn't know.  It's not up on the board.  Eric?  Yeah, I'm here.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I have a lady right here.  Not only is she a huge Tony Danza fan, she was telling me that she used to be on the Family Feud back in when?  1993.  1993.  Did you score big?  We did talk shows and we won over $18,000.  They won over $18,000 on the Family Feud. 
[02:44:00]  Wow.  That's wonderful.  Did you tell her that we're thinking about putting her on the Tony Danza show today?  Yes, I did.  And they're all excited.  Her and her family is right here.  They're just waiting to speak to Tony.  All right.  And where is she from?  Uncle, where are you from?  We are from New Jersey.  Surgeonsville.  They're from Surgeonsville, New Jersey.  All right.  And what's her name?  Her name is Joan.  I'm going to give her the phone right now.  Just get Tony ready.  He'll have to be here.  Tony character.  All right. 
[02:44:30]  Let's get Joan on the phone here.  Okay.  Here's Joan.  Yeah, he's right on the phone.  Hello, Tony.  Hey, Joan.  How are you doing?  I'm doing fine.  We can't wait to come inside and see you in person.  Well, I can't wait to have you on the show.  Thank you.  I mean, we watch it every day.  We love it.  I especially like the food, particularly.  Oh, you like the cooking segments.  I do.  I like the steamy-off food segments.  Well, you know, I love to cook.  Being Italian, you know, I cook a lot at home. 
[02:45:00]  Uh-huh.  And my kids, they get involved.  And I think it's something a lot of people like, you know?  Oh, you know what?  I have a great recipe for spaghetti and clams, the white sauce.  Spaghetti and clams.  That's my favorite.  Well, you know, I'll send you the recipe.  You got a fantastic recipe for that.  Yeah, I'll send it to you.  You know something?  Hey, one day I would love to have you maybe come on the show as, you know, a listener cooking 
[02:45:30]  segment or a viewer cooking segment, oops, and we could have you cook your special.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Actually, you know, if you ever come over to New Jersey, you can come out to Surgeonsville.  We live way out in the country.  And it's a beautiful area, close to the Delaware River.  Oh, you have a nice place out there?  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, we'll cook your spaghetti and clams first.  You might as well taste it before it's aired. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, I should taste it first.  I like taking a little taste before I dip in, you know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, how long have you been a fan?  You remember me from Taxi?  I'm sorry, Tanya.  I couldn't understand that.  Hey, you remember me from my old days in Taxi?  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  We've been following your career.  You know, I know that you do shows in Atlantic City.  We're about two hours away from Atlantic City.  Oh, two hours.  So you go there a lot? 
[02:46:30]  Say that again?  So you go to Atlantic City a lot?  Oh, yes.  Oh, I love going there.  The gambling.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  You all get on the big loser bus and take that down there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  It's great.  Are you going to be in Atlantic City soon?  Well, yeah.  You know, I got my album, so I like to sing.  And I go down there to Tropicana.  And I get up there and, you know, I whine and the rubes give me money. 
[02:47:00]  It's fantastic.  Oh, wonderful.  Well, I have a cousin who happens to own a condo right on the boardwalk at the end of the casinos.  And it is just fabulous to go and visit him.  That sounds fantastic.  Yes.  You know something?  What?  You sound like a big Tony Danza fan.  I am the biggest Tony Danza fan.  So I want to do something a little special for you. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Here it comes, kids.  Hold on to your hats.  Okay.  I need a little relaxation before the show.  You know, it's a stressful situation being out there.  I'm kind of new to the talk show thing.  You understand?  Yes.  So I'm thinking I could use a little company in the dressing room.  Oh, my goodness.  How would you like to come backstage and hang out with me while I get ready for the show?  I would love it.  I would love it to...  Do I bring my family? 
[02:48:00]  Me.  Excuse me?  Just me or do I bring the three people I came with?  Well, who do you have with you?  My husband is here, and my two friends, Karen and Phyllis.  Your husband's there?  Yes.  Well, that's fantastic.  Yes.  Can you see where this is going?  I can.  Now, I'd like you...  You know something?  Bring the whole family with you.  Oh, Tony.  Backstage to hang out with me before the show because I need to relax a little bit. 
[02:48:30]  Okay.  Great.  That's great.  Well, you are just so special to say that.  Thank you so very much.  I love being special.  And you know what relaxes me?  What's that?  I love to relax with you.  Strap in, kids.  You know what relaxes me backstage?  Excuse me?  You know what relaxes me backstage in my dressing room?  Sure.  A nice fucking blowjob.  Oh, my. 
[02:49:00]  I'm sorry.  I missed that on the phone.  No, you didn't.  Tony likes having his hogs suck before I got to placate to the rubes out there.  I would never use a word like placate.  What am I, insane?  Before I entertain all the rubes out there in my audience.  Oh, okay.  I like blowing a load on someone's face.  And you seem like that person. 
[02:49:30]  Okay.  Should I give this phone to Eric so he knows what's going on?  You better give it to him so he can run as fast as he can away from your husband when you tell him the news that you'll be backstage sucking Tony Danza's cock.  Okay.  Fantastic.  I heard what you said.  I'm going backstage, Eric.  Okay.  Okay, here.  I'm going to give you to Eric so you can tell him what's going on.  Fantastic.  Okay.  See you soon, Tony, and thank you so much. 
[02:50:00]  You certainly will.  All right.  I will come back right out.  Hey, run, Eric.  Run.  All right.  You got it?  Yeah, you can come home.  Wow.  Okay.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe.  Is she telling her husband right now?  Yeah, we can end it right there.  So there's another example of what we did with the rubes that wait on line outside the Tony Danza show.  Yeah.  That was the dirtier one.  It's a fun little gag.  So we decided if you're just tuning in to go today and do it again, and you might have heard it. 
[02:50:30]  If not, the replay's coming up in less than an hour.  You'll hear it.  And there's major controversy now.  Eric is back in the studio.  So, Eric, what happened?  We were convinced we were going to get away with it again.  Yeah.  Well, you did to an extent, but as soon as she handed the phone back to me, I turn around, and there's this guy right there.  And he starts going, who are you?  Who are you working for?  I didn't give him a name or who I was working for, right?  So, as I said on the phone, I'm like, this guy wants proof that I'm with, and I said another company. 
[02:51:00]  Of course.  All right?  And he said, and then he takes the phone out of my hand, and he closes the phone like this.  He just slaps it down and gets in my face.  Then he pulls me by my left shoulder here.  He did put his hands on you.  He pulled my shoulder, pulled me just, I mean, it wasn't like vicious, but it was about a foot away from where the line is, where everybody is.  It's assault.  And he gets right in my face, and he goes, I can have you arrested for disorderly contact, disrupting the show.  And he's going through all this other stuff.  I said, I'm on a public sidewalk with a cell phone talking to another person. 
[02:51:30]  So, he's just getting right in my face, and these two other guys come out from the building, look like cops, but not really cops kind of thing.  Dan's a security.  Yeah.  So, they come out there, and they're standing there, and they've got a list.  They've had some paper in their hand, and they're going over the thing, and I gave them a fake name, and they're just shaking their heads because that name's not on the list.  I guess they researched the show.  They have a list of everyone involved with this program.  He was trying to get me to say I was with Opie and Anthony.  Right.  He was trying, and I was saying, I'm not with them. 
[02:52:00]  I said, they're another company.  What was in the book?  I couldn't see them.  They wouldn't show it to me.  They had it.  They're going down this list here.  I saw a white piece of paper.  It's probably a list with all our faces and our names and all that.  Great.  Saying, we've had nothing but problems from this show.  We don't want these people out there.  We've been instructed to get rid of these people or do whatever's necessary to get rid of these people.  Whatever's necessary.  That's Tony Dan's behind the scenes, probably.  Assaulting our staff on a public sidewalk?  What happened with the phone?  You kept calling in.  The phone kept going down.  The guy kept shutting the phone.  How was he going to do that without touching you? 
[02:52:30]  All right.  At this point, when he pulls me aside and he's telling me, no, you cannot do that, right?  The first time he closes the phone and he's yelling at me, Ben calls.  So I open the phone again.  I'm talking to Ben for maybe...  And he's holding it on to you at this point?  No, he let me go.  He just pulled me one quick second away from the line and then let me go.  He wasn't still holding me.  Was he pulling you on your Tony Dancer t-shirt?  No, I hit that real quick.  Oh, you did?  I had the jacket right up there buttoned.  I was like, he's not seeing that shirt.  You pussy.  Hey, we're all on the same team. 
[02:53:00]  We all work for Tony.  So I'm standing on the sidewalk there, right?  Ben calls.  I talk to Ben maybe three to five seconds.  All of a sudden, out of my hand again.  Click.  He's got my phone now.  He took my phone.  He took the phone out of your hand.  Opened my phone and starts hitting buttons trying to see what's in the phone.  He's trying to find out where my phone book is on the phone, trying to find who I just dialed and all that.  Like Columbo, knock it off. 
[02:53:30]  How much, how, this guy wants so bad to be some type of cop.  Yep.  He's a lot of him.  He's, he's, now this is his big chance with his book with our names in it and grabbing the phone and trying to get numbers out of your phone.  That's invasion of privacy.  So as soon as he's doing that, I take the phone back and I close it, right?  I said, what are you doing?  And he said, let me see some ID.  I said, I don't have ID.  I took a cab here.  And I don't have to show you.  He goes, how much you want to bet if I go through your pockets right now, I find a wallet? 
[02:54:00]  And he's pointing to my left side here, which is my keys and my other phone.  Big lump.  And I said, those are keys.  And I said, and you're not searching me.  Now this time I realized I'm standing at the edge of the curb.  So I walk into the street.  Now I'm in the street.  He comes right to the edge, but he won't walk into the street.  And he's still yelling at me.  The two other guys.  Doesn't matter.  The sidewalk or the street.  It's not.  But I, Ben, it's like, Ben just goes, run into traffic.  So I'm trying to get into traffic.  You're going to be a fine parent, Ben.  Yes.  So I'm trying to get into traffic. 
[02:54:30]  There's cars coming.  So I'm stuck between that little gap of the street and the actual traffic.  And those other guys are blocking me.  So I can't move anywhere.  And then I'm trying to get on the phone again.  And the phone just, the last time it crapped out.  There you go.  There you go.  Running across the street.  Just run into traffic.  What's all that racket outside?  I'm trying to do a show.  I've got to be honest.  I don't think there's anything illegal about you being out there talking to people. 
[02:55:00]  There isn't.  No.  And I think that a public sidewalk, we might have to call and say, look, this guy grabbed  you.  He's shutting your phone.  That can't happen.  He grabbed you.  I don't care if he just pulled me a foot.  That's assault.  He kept taking your phone and shutting.  You can't touch somebody else's shit.  And then he started going through the phone.  Property is also another charge.  Yeah.  So what was going on with the lady that you talked to?  She was cool.  There was like a party of eight from Philadelphia.  It was like grandmothers, granddaughters, and regular daughters. 
[02:55:30]  There was a whole big family affair because one of them was getting married next week.  So they came up to go to the Tony Danza show.  And they were all excited.  They were having a blast talking on the phone.  They were all sitting there, Danny DeVito.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're all sitting there.  And they're trying to come up with the names of the people that Tony couldn't remember.  And one of the older ladies is tapping on.  He's like, he's got a CD.  Get a CD.  And then she goes, oh, yeah.  Can we get a CD?  And of course Tony said yes.  Of course.  A good egg.  What a good guy.  Oh, one of the other things he told me too when he goes, I guess you said, give Tony a kiss on the cheek. 
[02:56:00]  That's how you get in favor with Tony.  And he starts listing these other things which were never said.  But I didn't hear the phone call, so I don't know.  So I was like, I said, dude, I'm standing right next to you.  I did not hear that phone call.  Were they listening somewhere?  They might have an XM there.  They have an XM in there.  I guess they like the old Anthony show.  And the security probably had their fans.  Probably their job when that line is out there to listen to this program.  Well, I did a contest with those guys too for a free XM. 
[02:56:30]  Go home.  Just go home.  Jesus.  Just go home.  Can you get me a coffee while you're out there looking for a rope?  Yeah.  Please go home.  Just go.  Walk away.  Play the Hulk music.  Do something.  Get them out of here.  They can't ask you for ID or anything.  You're not running into the building causing it.  You're on a phone.  Yeah.  I didn't give them a thing.  Didn't tell them my name.  Didn't tell them who I worked for.  You took your pinch like a man.  You didn't write.  That's right.  Oh, De Niro again.  We can't tell you anymore.  Well, Master Poe is pacing like a mother hen.  He's freaking out.  He's positioning me outside. 
[02:57:00]  Now, how did he come at you?  What angle?  How did he come at you?  There's the real deal.  Master Poe, share the mic with Eric.  Yeah, okay.  That was assault.  And we should call the cops right now.  That is assault.  Right now.  You were assaulted on a public sidewalk.  I do agree.  By some stupid security guard.  Well, Master Poe, that's your call, obviously.  You know, Master Poe is very pissed off because he's...  I need someone to call 911.  He protects us.  He's like a mother hen.  One of these ducklings.  If that guy grabs you like that, you would have taken that as an assault.  You would have taken and reacted as an assault. 
[02:57:30]  Well, by law, you're not supposed to grab someone.  And if someone is attacking you or if someone is actually trying to grab you,  immediately you can defend yourself.  So it's self-defense.  And in his case, I don't know, you know, what the guy looks like or what skills he has.  It doesn't matter.  He's supposed to be a professional.  You can't put your hands on anybody.  It doesn't even matter how it is.  If you put your hand on someone's back, like you want to ask him a question,  and you put your hand on his back, once the hand touches somebody,  you can be charged with assault if that person wants to charge. 
[02:58:00]  Like an umpire back in, like Earl Weaver used to turn his hat around,  because if your hat touches the umpire, you were thrown out of the game.  Right.  Any type of contact.  Plus, I believe it's also a robbery, because he grabbed the phone out of his hands.  There's something else there.  Absolutely.  I'm not a police officer.  Let's get all the police officers out there to call.  I don't want to tie up emergency lines with that,  but we should call a precinct and do something about that.  You haven't talked to.  I think they need a talking to.  We've got an expert on the line.  Perhaps a bit more.  Keith, the cop.  What's up? 
[02:58:30]  Good morning.  I just got a call from Clubby.  He needs to be corrected.  Everything okay?  Hey, Ben.  Our boy Sex Bagel was roughed up a little bit outside the Tony Danza show.  He was assaulted by a Tony Danza security guard.  What do we have here?  What are the facts?  The facts are Eric was on the sidewalk while the line was going into the Tony Danza show.  He gave a woman that was online the telephone, and she got to speak with Tony Danza.  And Eric might have been impersonating a worker from the Tony Danza show. 
[02:59:00]  Right.  An employee.  Yeah.  So after the phone call is done, Eric takes the phone back.  A security guard for the Danza show, I believe, comes up to Eric and grabbed him by his shoulder  and pulled him over to him and started telling him how he wasn't allowed to do that, how  it was disorderly conduct, disruption of the show, all kinds of stuff that could get him 
[02:59:30]  he thought could get him in trouble.  But the fact of the matter is, the only person that did anything wrong was a security guard  by touching Eric.  And he kept taking his phone.  Eric's trying to call the show.  The guy keeps snatching his phone.  He snatched the phone out of Eric's hand and started going through his phone book trying  to find numbers in there.  After that, Eric just finally got away from the guy and ran back to the studio.  Okay.  All right.  So now we want to, you know, maybe somebody can go over there and speak with the security  guard because I think Eric feels that charges should be filed for assault. 
[03:00:00]  Well, I wouldn't say it's an assault.  I'm going to have to say it's more of a harassment.  Yes.  But this is the angle I'm going to work on this whole thing, and it might work for us.  If we can get Tony Danza to staple his ball bag to his leg, I think we can get Tony Danza  about a million and a half in bail.  You ass.  Why isn't that assault?  Uh, because in the statutes of the law of harassment, it's push, shove, kick, punch. 
[03:00:30]  It really, really doesn't go further than that.  We're kind of sounding faggy is what you're saying, huh?  Well, no, but harassment is still good, though.  It's still something.  That's a good one.  It is something.  He can't just do that.  He can't just snatch his phone and go through it on a public sidewalk.  We want to teach these talk show line security people that they can't get away with this  kind of stuff.  Brown shirts.  Yeah, well, you know, I mean, he was talking to Tony.  She was talking to Tony.  I don't know what this guy's problem is.  I know.  She was very happy. 
[03:01:00]  We're making people on the line happy.  Yeah, that's kind of, you know, out of line.  But, yeah, harassment.  Maybe I could work something with snatching the phone out of his hand.  Yeah.  I don't know how happy they would be over at the precinct.  But, you know, listen, this is a violation of his rights, and it's not.  We just want to know if we could violate someone with a billy club.  That's all we need to know, Keith.  Right.  Can we drag someone down to the precinct and give them the business in the men's bathroom?  We might be able to work something along those lines.  If you can't find anyone, I'll play the part of the prisoner. 
[03:01:30]  Did Ovi say mother hen and baby ducklings?  You guys let me slide on that one.  Not the audience.  I know.  Killer Kitten's like, mother hen and baby duckling.  Ovi, why not just say elephant with a baby cub, jackass?  There's another time where I start sweating going, oh, please.  They didn't be over that, did they?  The audience touches everything.  Oh, you're ratting me out, Killer Kitten.  Awesome, thanks.  Now, what do we do?  We want this guy brought up.  I think after the show.  We're going to just go for street justice. 
[03:02:00]  Well, if we don't go for the street justice, how about after the show, I'll talk to Eric,  and we'll see what we can come up with.  Let's do that.  I'll make a couple phone calls.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  A lot of people are calling us a bunch of facts on the instant feedback.  Why?  They're like, shut up, Saul.  They want to know if Sex Bagel was very injured.  Eric was very injured.  He grabbed me, and I was hurt.  Were you physically hurt?  Well, my feelings were very hurt, and I felt ashamed. 
[03:02:30]  I was standing on the sidewalk, and he pushed me and took my phone.  He went through my phone book and realized I have no friends and pointed that out to me.  I was very embarrassed.  He was hurtful.  I just think that if I did get the call, and I showed up, and Eric told me that he was  working the line to see if any ladies wanted to lick Tony's mule, and then the security 
[03:03:00]  guy pushed me, it's a little hard to write up in the report, but I'm going to try and  work an angle.  All right.  It's a radio show doing an on-the-street interview.  That's right.  That's pretty much what it was.  I can't touch him.  I have one question.  Yes, Master Poe.  Hey, Keith.  Isn't there a progression when it comes to ... This is for the listeners out there, because  they're saying that Eric is a wimp, the way he responded, or the way that we're responding.  I think Poe's saying that, Eric.  No, no, no.  No, no.  I'm not.  Actually, there's a progression.  If someone is coming at you verbally, that's step number one. 
[03:03:30]  Then they're going to come at you physically.  In this case, he grabbed him.  All right.  So after that, he's going to throw a punch and hit him in the face.  Yes.  Come on.  You have to draw the line somewhere.  What country are we living in?  Russia.  I mean, where are we?  Where are we?  Canada.  Freedom.  Freedom.  No, I personally think that it was wrong for him to do that, and that wasn't professional.  It's just that, you know, how wrong was it?  I mean, you know, in the eyes of the law. 
[03:04:00]  Gotcha.  I don't think it's a felony, but I do think that maybe the security guard needs a talking  to, because this way, there's nothing wrong with one of our guys talking to somebody on  the phone there.  That's not illegal, and it's allowed.  Too bad they're lighting up for your show.  Stop using a public sidewalk, then, assholes.  Make them line up in the studio.  Oh, we'll be back.  Oh, we'll be back.  Eric is a very willful young boy.  Rather naughty.  Rather naughty.  All right, Keith.  Thanks.  All right.  I'll catch up.  Your son is attempting to bring an outside radio show into this situation. 
[03:04:30]  All right.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Bye, Keith.  Yeah.  There goes the party pooper.  And you never even mentioned Oral.  You said just a back rub.  You didn't say.  Of course I did.  Did you?  Not that that makes any difference, but...  And I do believe that ends the Tony Danza saga for today.  There you go.  Yeah.  Danza's a bully.  Danza's brown shirts.  Yeah.  Nazis.  Should we tell Paul he won the MiFi, I guess?  Yeah.  Oh.  Geez, he's still out there.  Yeah.  Make sure Tony doesn't take it from a motherly out. 
[03:05:00]  Oh.  Let's bring...  Snatch it out of his hand.  Let's bring Paul back in from Jersey.  He won the MiFi.  If you want to win a MiFi, we're still seeing what you would do to win a MiFi.  The Portable XM Satellite Radio.  Just email us at opianthony.com or foundrymusic.com, okay?  I just think it's hysterical that we found out that they really do listen to this program.  I really thought we were going to get away with it again.  Web page.  We haven't mentioned it in a week.  We're going to have to use code words now when we go to do it.  Code words we didn't say.  Also, we just went to the phone and started the bit. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  And they were honest like that.  How the hell are we going to get away with it in the future?  We'll figure it out.  What kind of code word can you use for Danza?  Oh, we'll be back.  Maybe you play the retard singing time of my life and that's the Danza signal.  Oh, we'll be back.  Oh, yeah, we will.  Oh, yeah.  So you won the MiFi, Paul.  Congratulations.  There you go, my friend.  Thank you, guys.  Bravo.  You are a good egg.  You took it like a man.  Your tongue revolted.  Barfed a little bit, but you did a good job. 
[03:06:00]  Thank you.  You want to say anything?  Any plugs?  Anybody you want to say hi to?  I got nothing going on.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Really don't.  The guys back at the guarding center?  Oh, yeah.  The guarding center?  Gardening.  Gardening.  Guys back in the guarding center.  Gardening center.  The guys watching the azaleas with machine guns.  I want to say hello to them.  All right.  We'll play a little cute thing here.  Take a break.  What is it, Ope?  We'll get into something.  What do we got? 
[03:06:30]  I just duck job.  Aw.  A little duck job thing.  And then we'll continue.  Something new.  I don't know if we have time to play the racist songs today.  Aw.  You want to just try to end with that today?  That's kind of fun.  They are pretty nasty.  All right.  We'll try to do that next.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That feels so good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, slow down.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Play with my boys. 
[03:07:00]  Play with my boys.  Oh, that feels so good.  Yeah.  Just roll them around.  That is so good.  Oh, my God.  I love it with you.  Uh-oh.  Slow it.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  Don't move.

[03:09:00]  There you go.  I never liked highvoltage because it just...  Is that electricity?  Yeah.  It's very good.  I think because we're shocking.  And it's just like...

Yeah, just sit around your hotel room all afternoon long just waiting for that cell phone to ring.  Yeah, it'll happen.  Yeah.  Yeah, so no post-show conference call today.  Cool.  All right.  I don't like the fact that your names aren't in the title of that channel.  Well, yeah.  Well, we've been saying a lot of things for a long time. 
[03:10:00]  Okay.  We got some racist music.  And I got to tell you, I wanted to hate this stuff, but as far as comedy goes, it's kind of funny.  It's very hateful.  The lyrics, very hateful and hurtful, Opie.  So it's...  People are offended.  I understand that.  People are very offended by it.  Definitely stereotyping.  It's hate music.  It'll be number one with a bullet in Boston.  Oh, Boston will love this.  DCN should add the record. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, Boston.  It does rock.  Yeah, Boston, crank up this next segment.  You're going to love it.  I'll give it that.  And also, they make a point that a lot of black groups, groups, one of my, Larry King, you know, a lot of the combos, a lot of the Negro combos, put together songs.  You know, they write a lot of anti-white stuff and black power stuff and black empowerment music. 
[03:11:00]  And then when Whitey tries it, there's a big problem.  Then it's racist music.  And these guys decided to put together some white power.  Anti-white people are dissed in this, Opie.  Blacks, Mexicans.  Well, the first song is called People Haters.  People Haters.  It's a song about the white, the white, the wigger, as they call them.  Correct.  The wigger.  So, what's this guy about?  The article was in Newsweek.  I think 2020 is going to do a whole thing on him, or 60 Minutes, one of those. 
[03:11:30]  60 Minutes, or one of them?  I don't know.  Steve knows that, but.  I saw it on Newsweek.  Yeah, it's in Newsweek, and then 60 Minutes is going to do something, Steve?  Yeah, 60 Minutes is actually taping at his house.  I love when he doesn't put his headphones on.  He just talks right over the music.  All right, so, we caught his attention because we saw this article in Newsweek.  Ben brought it to our attention.  Yes.  And what's this guy all about?  Well, his name is Byron Colvert, and he's got a record company.  And, five years old, he's becoming the top white power. 
[03:12:00]  He's five years old?  What?  Dad, talk.  I don't know.  What?  Ben's trying to reason.  I can't help it.  And Norton's just pointing at his mule.  I can't help it if your sweater doesn't cover that bulbous appendage.  Anyways.  Oh, my God, you totally flustered him.  He goes, just like, oh, oh.  And just points at his mule, and it completely flustered Ben.  Anyways, they distribute 100,000 of these CDs to schools, and he's got that whole drug 
[03:12:30]  dealer philosophy.  We hook him with the music, and then the kids learn and buy more online.  He says, we just don't entertain racist kids.  We create them.  And they're online to make a million bucks this year.  But how big is that thing?  Okay, Parento over there.  Hey, come on now.  So these guys are handing these CDs out at schools?  Yeah.  What grade?  Does it say? 
[03:13:00]  13 to 19-year-olds.  13 to 19-year-olds.  They're handing out these things.  Junior highs.  And they're from Minnesota?  Yeah.  So I guess it's within that area or all over the country?  It doesn't say, actually, in the article.  But yeah.  What do they do?  They just give these CDs to kids at school to put in the front of their jeans?  Not yet.  Don't put them on hold.  Fucking people don't listen.  Jesus.  Steve really has to start listening.  Why?  Oh.  The music.  Not now.  Not now.  Steve doesn't listen. 
[03:13:30]  No, he's a...  He works really hard, and because he works so hard, he doesn't sleep, and he doesn't listen.  I said not now.  You didn't say not now, but he said...  You might have said not now, but he said, get him on the phone and keep him talking.  He was talking to him, so he wasn't going to hear him.  No, no, no.  Just not now.  He's waiting for our call.  We'll talk to him.  All right?  Fine.  Fine.  Whatever.  And this fucking guy's going to giggle and make me look like a fucking flaming jackass.  That's your hat. 
[03:14:00]  Well, the flaming hat.  Flaming's the hat.  I know.  You know what, but...  No, no, no.  He was just talking to him off the line.  There wasn't anything there.  Let's all get on the same page.  If he's talking to him...  I don't want...  No.  Okay.  I don't want him on hold or anything yet.  Oh, I don't know what you mean.  He wasn't putting him on hold.  Shut up, you.  I don't know what you mean.  I'm just trying to...  Steve, just punch him in the face.  I'm trying to figure it out.  It looks like a big, juicy dilemma.  See, I can't...  You can punch him in the face.  I can't punch Ben in the face, because if I put Ben into these...  I know, because he's harking and jerking.  How do you hit Ben?  I'll miss him.  He's harking and jerking.  No, it's some permanent damage to poor Ben.  I don't want to do that.  And you've got that deep bass voice. 
[03:14:30]  You've got to put your headphones on, because you're just blowing everyone away.  Yeah.  Wow.  Also, I was like...  Oh, man.  All right.  Sorry, Steve.  Holy jeez.  Okay.  Dude.  What?  Steve was pissed.  Oh, he was hot.  I understand, but...  He was hot under the collar and on top of his head.  Is Voss really sleeping?  He was hot under the ankles.  What?  Are you sleeping?  No, no.  I was just thinking of something.  He was still sleeping.  Oh, my God.  Voss is sleeping during the show.  You are an old man.  He nods off like a grandpa. 
[03:15:00]  I was going like...  I was thinking of something.  I was going to support your friends.  What are you thinking of?  The show stinks that bad, you have to fall asleep.  I was asleep.  What were we just talking about?  You were asleep.  What just happened?  I'm going to tell you everything that just happened.  Okay, what just happened?  Steve came in here...  Pack of lies.  Steve came in here because he was accused of the phone, whatever, and Ben, he didn't  want to hit Ben in the bobbing head.  Okay.  All right.  What limb did Ben admit that he's smuggling in the front of his pants?  The one that he was blocking with his CD.  I was...  I just closed my eyes because my head went from...  When you scratch behind your ear real hard, I get a headache. 
[03:15:30]  So I was closing my eyes.  I'm not tired at all.  He was asleep.  I was not asleep.  You were asleep.  Was I drooling?  If I was drooling, then I'd be asleep.  You were asleep.  Canole cock.  Did you notice that he was asleep?  We should have just let him...  Continue.  Let him continue.  No, I was just...  I swear to God, I wasn't asleep.  You just fell asleep.  I know he was asleep because the listeners are writing, Voss was funnier than ever.  Voss is old.  All right, so...  We're going to talk to the guy in a minute, too, but I wanted to play some of the songs  first, Anthony.  Yeah, I'll put him on hold.  Just call him when you're ready for him.  That's what I'm saying. 
[03:16:00]  I hear you, Ope.  All right.  Use that phone that's in the front of Ben's pants.  Are all these songs on the same CD?  It's like a...  How many college students could fit in that one?  Is it a compilation disc?  Yes?  From different artists, Steve?  Steve, you can come back in.  We're not going to bite you.  Come on in, Steve.  Oh, this is the same artist?  Same artist?  Same artist is on those tracks, yeah.  It's, uh...  Just play it.  Oh.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Yeah.  What?  Those are all by the same artist, yeah. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, really?  That's a group called the People Haters, but the compilation that he's handing out is a  bunch of different artists.  Problem is, and I had this conversation with him last night, it's all a lot of this grind  core, hardcore stuff that you can't understand the lyrics, so I wanted to make sure the stuff  that he gave us...  What good is racist music if you can't understand the...  Exactly.  ...hateful lyrics.  What's the first song called?  Uh, People Haters, it's white...  Oh, okay.  Sabbath?  Sabbath?  Oh. 
[03:17:00]  You look like a nigga.  You dress like a nigga.  You talk like a nigga.  You walk just like a nigga.  You're a white nigga, a white nigga, a white nigga.  Gonna pull the finger out of white nigga, white nigga.  Alright.  You're a white nigga, white nigga.  You want to be black.  You're a white nigga, a white nigga, a white nigga.  All right. 
[03:17:30]  You're a white nigga, white nigga.  All right.  You're a white nigga, a white nigga, a white nigga.  You're a white nigga, a white nigga, a white nigga, a white nigga.  Jig-a-boo.  Jig-a-boo.  Jig-a-boo.  Wow.  I like it.  It's catchy.  It kind of rocks.  A white nigga.  A white nigga.  Have we officially started the Most Offensive Song Contest 2? 
[03:18:00]  I think some of these might be contenders.  That one, the guy doesn't like watching the white guys walk around talking with a black  dialect and wearing the pants around their ass.  Things like that, I guess.  So we wrote that little ditty.  It is embarrassing to see a white guy behaving like that.  Just to see such a desperate need to assimilate to be accepted so he doesn't get beat up.  Word.  Like conquering somebody that you think is going to hurt you.  Word.  Word.  Word.  Word.  No, man, I know what you're saying. 
[03:18:30]  Not that I mind Danny tilting his hat to the left.  Our own Danny does tilting his hat to the left.  No, but Danny talks normal, but he's got his hat cocked like he's ready for anything,  dog.  Well, the next song is called...  Speaking of cocked, Ben.  We're trying to sample this, Anthony, trying to understand, I guess.  A little sample, sure.  The second track is called The Towel is Not a Hat.  A towel is not a hat.  Well, that's a good one.  Okay.  The greatest thing I've ever heard. 
[03:19:00]  Middle Eastern sound.  Yeah.  That's actually a cool sound right there.  That's pretty good. 
[03:19:30]  Go to the store.  Get the groove.  Another 68 rap.  Worst than a Jew.  Ever heard of the soul?  You smell like fucking shit.  I can't tell on your head.  You make me fucking dick.  Go to the head.  Go to the head.  Go to the head.  Go to the head.  Yeah. 
[03:20:00]  Pick up your fucking towel.  Go to the head.  Just a towel head.  Let him opportunity.  This works piece of bricks.  This old family's gonna rip you off.  Matters kill your chain.  Break on your head.  Go for greasy veins.  Yeah.  There you have it. 
[03:20:30]  A towel is not a hat, Anthony.  Just imagine the death moshing that goes on during that.  You just know they're killing each other.  Doing the Hitler salute.  Yeah.  Like wailing into each other's faces with their crew cuts.  That's such a good song, though.  It's a great song.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  There was one part where it said, worst than the Jew.  I knew you did.  Yeah, yeah.  Arab, worst than the Jew.  See that?  And he's right.  Fall asleep on a radio show. 
[03:21:00]  Radio show?  Radio show.  Fall asleep on a radio show.  I stink.  Well, you know, it happens.  A little radio, radio.  Another sample here, Anthony.  What is it?  Well, the gays aren't safe, either.  Oh, the gays?  Yeah.  Yeah, the hate guys.  You know, they usually hate the blacks and the Jews and stuff, but they're not a big  fan of the gays, either.  I think gays are number one.  No.  Jews.  Gays are two.  Oh. 
[03:21:30]  Shooters!  We hate all shooters!  And we're all shooters!  Shit, dick!  Mick Jagger!  Shit, dick!  Michael Jackson!  Shit, dick!  Jeffrey Dahmer!  Cannonball!  Shit, dick! 
[03:22:00]  We hate shit, dick!  What's that, Darren Arn?  But slamming shit, dick!  Boy!  George!  Shit, dick!  Freddie Mercury!  Shit, dick!  David Bowie!  Shit, dick!  Rob Halpert, dude, is pretty kicking!  All right. 
[03:22:30]  Mick Jagger?  Come on.  Shit, dick!  Well, the legendary story with Mick Jagger.  I know, it's so what.  I know, it's so what.  Shit, dick!  Liberace!  Shit, dick!  Jim, neighbor!  Shit, dick!  Robert Englund,  Freddy Krueger!  Freddy Krueger!  Freddy Krueger!  He's gay?  Freddy Krueger's a shit dick?  Freddy, what?  What?  What, what, what, what?  He's a shit dick?  Truman Capote!  Shit, dick!  Everybody!  Richard Simmons!  Oh.  Shit, dick! 
[03:23:00]  Rod Stewart!  Shit, dick!  Jim!  Nor!  Shit, dick!  Wait, hey, hey!  Whoa!  Shit, chest!  That's right.  Ben, Sparks, Big Dick!  Big Dick!  Oh, stop.  Shit, shit, dick!  Shit, chest, and Big Dick, that's our songs.  Rich, boss, shithead! 
[03:23:30]  There's gotta be an anti-Jew song on there.  Yeah, what about it?  What was the song called?  Afro.  Probably not it.  A shit dick.  That's the greatest thing.  That's already probably gonna be a message board name.  Yeah.  Shit dick, says.  I just, I don't want to focus on one group.  I don't want to have an agenda here.  Well, we don't.  They have a song called Afro, and Day of the Rope, and Ebonics.  We can play Spickillia. 
[03:24:00]  Spickillia?  Yeah.  I guess that's the Hispanic.  He doesn't like the wetbacks going to this country.  All right.  Well, going back to the guy that...  Shit dick, shit dick.  God, I'm a thing.  That might replace...  I like that.  Oh, shit dick.  Here's Spickillia.  That's all Jesus.  That's all Jesus. 
[03:24:30]  He doesn't like the toast.  So he's through his place.  So he's through everywhere. 
[03:25:00]  I'm out of the trace.  Sterling needs a vermin, just like a rat.  Close the door to men, so he's not going to lie to fool.  Ey, ey, ey.  E-ner's coming over the border.  Ey, ey, ey.  We all tied to war.  We got two reason armies.  Bring him in.  It's safe.  Storm the gates of Mexico.  I can't really understand them. 
[03:25:30]  Electrify the fences?  Yeah.  Fill yourself a grease and stick.  Gotcha.  Aye, aye, aye.  Aye, aye, aye.  Feenars coming over the border.  Catchy.  I like Mexican radio better.  I'm on a Mexican radio.  He comes out with baked beans on his face. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  A radio.  A radio.  I understand the hate angle in these songs, but they're also kind of silly.  They're fantastic songs.  Yeah, and people aren't going to take their hate seriously if they kind of put them into catchy, funny songs like that.  You know what?  You sound like a real shit dick.  Jimmy Robinson's so much better than you.  I think we have another song here, Anthony.  Do you have the last one?  Oh, yes, yes.  The one for, well, what they call the preverts. 
[03:26:30]  The preverts?  Yeah, yeah.  They're really not a big fan of the preverts.  All right, let's hear that one.  Internet is more porn.  Internet is more porn.  Swat.  Hit me up all night, hugging me.  Horns, you corn, corn, corn.  Wow.  Yeah.  Huh.  Boss, that's funny.  You collapsed.  That's hilarious.  I didn't hear it.  I didn't get it.  You really got to get an XM radio.  How do you not have an XM radio?  Mike Brady, shit dick. 
[03:27:00]  Robert Reed, shit dick.  Greg Brady, shit dick.  Hey, hey, hey, ho.  He's a friend of ours.  Hey, hey.  Did he invite you over for dinner one night?  He's married with a kid.  Beard.  Guys that don't put in your razors fast enough at any W.  Shit dicks.  Wow. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  That's so inside, I just got hit in the thigh.  Intern that bangs your $1,000 hooker for free all weekend long.  Thought he was a shit dick.  Fuck.  God, I suck.  Thought he was a...  Thought he had a...  Goddamn ass.  That's right.  Uh-huh.  Those were shit dicks.  What is this?  A string of shit dicks? 
[03:28:00]  Those were shit dicks.  Mr. Faber-Shamb.  Oh, God.  I suck.  I almost made it all the way through that, and I screwed it up.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, problem.  Mm-hmm.  Problem.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I see Opie just got a note.  A communique, Anthony.  A communique.  Urgent communique.  There's a Q and a U in that.  Stephen Lynch has a song called Vanilla Ice Cream.  Have we ever heard that one?  Yeah, he played it live on the show.  Oh, yeah? 
[03:28:30]  He doesn't like white people.  He likes the mocha girls and everybody else.  That's a good idea.  Oh, right.  I do remember that.  That's a good song.  Yeah, I just put it in there in case you wanted it.  All right.  Well, considering we're just trying to waste time now, sure, why don't we play that?  Stephen Lynch.  A song about the truth.  I wrote it about a lady I was seeing not too long ago.  Hopefully, I'll remember the lyrics.  Have a seat and listen.  Please don't say a thing. 
[03:29:00]  In matters of the heart sometimes, the truth will have a sting.  Just don't take it personally.  This is no attack.  But we will never last because I'm white and you are also white.  I only like black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  If you are newbie and I want you to be in every fantasy.  But if you're a whitey, say nighty-nighty, you're just not the girl for me. 
[03:29:30]  Woo-hoo.  Well, her body is a turn-on, curvaceous front and back.  Her hair is quite literally an aphrodisiac.  Don't call it jungle fever, because that just isn't right.  I am not a racist.  Some of my best friends are white.  I just prefer black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait. 
[03:30:00]  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  Well, if you're a cracker, you better get blacker, or else you best get out.  It is no mystery.  I like a sister.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Oh, man, I hate vanilla ice cream.  White rice is so bland.  The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand.  The color is not the issue here. 
[03:30:30]  It's dignity.  It's class.  It's all about her heart.  Okay, it's partly about that ass.  I want me some black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  Well, if you're a honky, you're singing the wrong key.  It's the honest truth.  The skin that she's dwelling in must contain melanin.  That is the fountain of you.  Thomas Jefferson. 
[03:31:00]  Robert De Niro.  Well, strong, thermal.  Strong, thermal.  Yeah.  Ah, yes, our buddy Stephen Lynch.  Yes.  Didn't that heal everything?  Vanilla ice cream, right?  We're just about done with the show for today, guys.  And I don't think we've done anything.  Did we do anything? 
[03:31:30]  We had fun.  I know we had fun.  We learned a lot.  We almost got Eric arrested.  True.  Listen for that in the replay.  I think that was the highlight of the show today.  It was fun.  There were a lot of highlights, I guess.  That security guy was at a lie.  You can't grab a guy's dick and start checking for shit.  You really like that song, don't you?  How can you not?  It's classic.  All right.  Well, why don't we play, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Where's Voss?  I don't know.  He's smoking somewhere.  Smoking or sleeping. 
[03:32:00]  Smoking all depressed that he had a bad appearance.  Where is he?  His appearance was fine.  It was fine.  He's probably smoking out the window.  He's so addicted.  He really smokes a lot.  He's got to stop.  He really does smoke a lot.  What an ass.  I don't mean his behavior.  I mean, have you seen him?  Terrific.  We're all giddy now.  Rob from Long Island.  What's up?  It's a coffee clutch.  First, I want to say thank you for picking me for the sticker stop tomorrow. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, cool.  Well, where's the sticker stop tomorrow on that line?  Exit 69 South on the LIE tomorrow.  Jesus, dude.  I'll be there from 6 to 8.  Why don't you pick a populated area?  Well, that's where my road stop is.  I drive a coffee truck.  All right.  If you're in the area, please stop by and get a WOW sticker from Rob.  So, what's up?  Okay.  I learned that that boss doesn't own an iPod because he's afraid the needle's going to skip.  Very good.  I have one to read from someone.  All right.  Go ahead.  This is from Fast Freddy in Jamaica Station. 
[03:33:00]  The real shit dick is Tippi Tom.  Oh, God.  Thanks for the visual.  Dave, what's going on?  How are you doing?  Okay.  Anthony, it's only this, not that.  It's only this, not that.  Right.  This or this.  This or this.  Oh, wow.  This.  Good, good, good, good.  It's that.  Johnny from Tennessee.  What's up, Johnny?  Where are you?  Johnny.  Yeah, Johnny.  Hey, Johnny.  Tennessee.  Maybe the guy's name isn't even Johnny.  He has a good one. 
[03:33:30]  He wants to say Everqueer and it's a shit dick.  I am not a shit dick with Everqueer.  Not at all.  Let's go to Mitch from Jersey.  I didn't get my wizard robe last night.  I learned that...  Hello?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I learned that Tommy Lee used to bang Pamela Lee Majors.  Oh, that's a good one.  We did learn that today.  Thank you.  All right.  Take her easy.  You know, I didn't even get the fact that Pamela Lee tied in with Tommy Lee until he just  said it.  What a great reference that was that he did.  Oh, thank you.  I was just thinking Farrah Fawcett.  I didn't catch the name Lee.  Right.  God damn that was great.  My pal is brilliant. 
[03:34:00]  Thank you, Jimmy.  That was a really good one, man.  God damn.  Just sit back and enjoy when he gives you that type of material.  Bob, what's up?  You know, you're acting like a real...  What?  No?  No.  Shit dick.  What?  You're not in the...  You're a shit dick.  Bob, what's up?  Oh, my God.  Bobby, help us out.  You know, Bob...  Maybe you should touch his arm and go, Bob?  Get the same response.  Yeah, right?  You know what?  I gotta tell you, the listeners get like a C-minus today. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, especially for what have we learned.  They have really slowed down the program.  They have no clue when they're on the air, when they're not.  Rich, the legacy.  What's up, Rich?  Yeah, guys.  I learned that Rich Ross needs a director to make him funny.  Oh.  Do I?  That means we all get the phone calls later.  You don't think I was that bad on the show today, do you?  Well, you're not gonna kill every day.  Ross is very funny.  That doesn't matter.  I'm not gonna kill every day.  We all know you're funny.  It doesn't matter.  My job was to bring air juice in today.  Air juice? 
[03:35:00]  What the hell is air juice?  What is air juice?  Air from my ear.  You said air.  You said air juice.  What's an air juice?  Air.  Is that kind of like an heirloom, but that's when you leave that gunk for your kids?  Ear.  Ear, whatever.  Michael O.J. Jordan is air juice.  George from Jersey.  Anyone?  Thought it was funny.  That's good.  George.  See, the guy's laughing.  Oh, good.  Thank you.  I got one from the caller.  Just because we're in a coma in the studio doesn't mean someone out there is not laughing.  Don't worry about it.  What's on your mind, shit dick?  Go ahead, George. 
[03:35:30]  George.  I learned today that mother hands protect their ducklings.  Nice.  Thanks.  Thanks for remembering that one.  You got it.  All right.  A lot of Jersey callers.  We like Jersey.  They're dependable.  I'll say.  Chris, go ahead.  Yeah, I learned that little Jimmy's new nickname is Shit Chat.  Very nice.  Mark from upstate New York.  Hello.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I learned Jigaboos.  It's a very fun song to sing, and I was wondering if you checked behind Ben's iPad yesterday. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, very good reference.  No, I think Ben was really sick.  Ben was really sick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Duke, what's going on?  Yeah, I learned that Tony Danza was a few shows nowadays, huh?  Yeah, a bunch of people over at the Danza show seem to listen.  Yeah, I want to say hi to everyone at the Tony Danza show that listens to the Opie and Anthony show.  Doing a good job.  On XM Satellite Radio.  Dope boy.  I learned that there are cowboy's balls over at the driving range, and Anthony's girlfriend dresses him.  Yes.  Spickillia.  Check it in already.  I learned that a towel is definitely not a hat, and that Freddy Krueger is a shit dick. 
[03:36:30]  I don't know about that, though, huh?  Boston Strangler from whackbag.com.  I learned today that if you get caught in the Danza line...  Run!  Run, Eric!  Run!  Can I get Ed C. from New York?  I learned that Jim McGreevy is a shit dick.  Adele from New York.  I learned that the old NEW sports guys will be fired for having sex in a church.  That's actually a very good one.  And Joe from Greenwich, Connecticut.  I learned that Voss's next appearance will be in my left ear, co-starring Daniel Day-Lewis. 
[03:37:00]  You want to plug anything, Voss?  DVD, richvoss.com.  Very funny.  Read the write-up on CringeHumor.  And you can get it.  I'll be...  I'm at the downtown the 23rd of December.  Show's over.  Program complete. </pre>
