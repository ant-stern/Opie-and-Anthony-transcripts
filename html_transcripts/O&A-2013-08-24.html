<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a Friday recap, noting Opie and Anthony's absence due to separate, vaguely described, alleged homosexual arrests.  The show then transitioned into a "Worst of the Week Countdown" segment hosted by Sam Roberts.  UFC fighter Anderson Silva was the first in-studio guest.  He discussed his career, training (including surprisingly, past ballet training), upcoming rematch with Chris Weidman, diet, and hobbies like paintball and soccer, mentioning trips to Brazil and Thailand.  Comedian Tom Papa then joined the countdown, commenting on the unrealistic and potentially dangerous portrayal of firearms in vintage toy gun commercials, illustrated with clips. Radio personality Dennis Falcone followed, detailing his unusual hobby of collecting and sharing radio jingles at "jingle parties."  The segment concluded with a compilation of various radio jingles.

A subsequent segment began with a disturbing anecdote about a domestic violence audio recording, before shifting to a discussion about the jingle industry and the experiences of a jingle writer named Denny.  The hosts then interviewed Denny about the history of the radio industry.

Next, Anthony recounted his recent Las Vegas trip in graphic detail.  He described seeing "Menopause the Musical" (using highly vulgar language about its themes of aging female anatomy), playing with full-automatic weapons at a shooting range, watching *Elysium* at a drive-in (which he criticized), suffering significant gambling losses and a confrontation with a suspected "cooler," and seeing Penn & Teller.  He also detailed visits to the Hoover Dam and a lazy river.  Extensive clips from "Menopause the Musical" were played.

The show then featured another "Worst of the Week" segment.  It began with the hosts discussing extreme heat from a recent trip, followed by several commercial breaks (Vivint, What'sYourPrice.com, Optima Tax Relief, Power Swabs, and AdamandEve.com; Alan Thicke provided a voiceover for Optima Tax Relief). The segment centered on an interview with "Giant Scrotum Guy," William Warren Jr., who discussed his massive scrotal edema, its origins in an injury, its massive size (once weighing 145 pounds), and the extensive medical treatments he underwent.  The countdown's climax revealed the week's "worst" moment: the hosts' premature announcement of a Metallica concert at the Apollo Theater, a leak of confidential information secured by their talent booker, Roland.  The segment extensively covered Roland's panicked reactions via text messages, the resulting online news coverage (ABC News and TMZ), and Roland's defeated but accepting arrival at the studio, with the hosts teasing potential consequences.

A later segment focused on the fallout from the Metallica announcement. The hosts expressed increasing anxiety and used profanity,  making vulgar jokes, and discussing their plans for retribution against those who might have leaked the information, including threats to harass family members online.  Greg Hughes, an "on-air reporter," was briefly mentioned but not present.  A pre-recorded interview with comedian Tom Papa and his guest, Tom Rhodes, was played.  Rhodes discussed his international stand-up career, early struggles, his father's influence, and his ambition to create a travel show focusing on international comedy.

The final segment featured Tom Rhodes as a guest, discussing his global success in stand-up comedy, the impact of the internet on his career (comparing the accessibility of his material online to pornography), his experiences performing internationally, his travels with his photographer wife, and his views on different cultures.  The segment included commercial breaks (including Sirius XM) and closing comments mentioning Joe Rogan, an Entertainment Weekly Radio Fall Movie Preview, and mortgage rates from PennyMac.  The show concluded with the hosts still fretting about the potential consequences of the Metallica announcement.

When we take the best of this week's Opie and Anthony Show, call it the worst, and then count it down for your listening pleasure.  Here's your host, what?  Yes, yes, yes.  It's the Worst of the Week Countdown with me, Sam Roberts, highlighting all the very best that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Of course, you can hear me every day on the Opie and Anthony Show, as well as hosting after Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:03:30]  A lot to get to this week on the Countdown as we highlight all the wonderful moments that happened this week.  Like, Roland thought he lost his job, our talent booker.  Hilarious.  We look at one of the worst musicals.  It's this new musical that Anthony stumbled across.  We also hear about Anthony's trip to Las Vegas.  Of course, a visit from Dennis Falcone, a guy who used to have a giant scrotum.  That's not Dennis Falcone.  It's another guy.  And a whole lot more.  All that is still to come first. 
[00:04:00]  Opie and Anthony decided not to come in to do the show on Friday.  I believe, according to the show, there was some kind of homosexual arrest involving the two, but they were separate events.  I'm not quite sure.  Regardless, the show was hosted by myself, Jim Florentine, Jim Norton, and Diamond David Lee Roth.  Yes!  What an all-star lineup.  And it only got bigger when UFC star Anderson Silva stopped by.  This is how we start the Countdown.  Anderson Silva in studio with Diamond Dave, Jim Norton, and the rest of the bunch on the Worst of the Week Countdown. 
[00:04:30]  Number 8.  Number 8.  8.  8.  8.  8.  8.  Number 8.  I started training the Jiu-Jitsu, the Nova Union in Curitiba.  Were you scared of it when you first started it?  Because you thought it was dangerous?  Yeah.  And my first fight in the city is the Cuiabá, Corumbá, in Brazil. 
[00:05:00]  Now, we're at a point now with Anderson, and for those of you that follow UFC, for the first time in a long time, you're the ex-champion of the middleweight division.  And I was at the fight, and it was a very shocking thing to see.  What did you feel when you woke up on the canvas?  Because for you, that's not something that happens very often.  Not too much. 
[00:05:30]  It's normal.  Fight is fight.  You have the moment magic, and you have the chance for knock-em-out your opponent, and you opponent knock-em-out you.  But it's normal.  I back the Zember for the next match.  UFC 168 is Saturday, Chris Weidman, who's now the champion, versus Anderson, and I think that's in Vegas? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, in Vegas.  It is in Vegas.  And at first you said no rematch.  The first thing you said was you didn't want to fight Chris again.  What changed?  The first time I signed the new contract, Dana talked to me, you fight for Chris Weidman, you win, or Chris win, you have the rematch.  All right? 
[00:06:30]  All right.  But the first time they finished the fight, my fight, the Chris Weidman, I'm tired and not too much happy, and talked, oh, I know more fight for the belt.  But I fight, but no more for the belt.  But Dana talked to me, hey, what happened?  This is normal.  Let's go.  Do you feel you lost giving it your best fight? 
[00:07:00]  Because you were taunting him.  Do you feel like you lost giving it your best, or do you feel like you didn't want to lose that way?  I train hard for win all the time, but sometimes you don't have too much chance for win.  But Chris Weidman is the very, very, very strategy, and you focus straight. 
[00:07:30]  And let's see, sometimes you have the good working, sometimes bad working.  No, you train hard for the fight.  You were in shape to fight.  You were ready to fight.  But I mean, in the moment.  Like, in that moment when he tagged you and you went down, were you in a moment, like, you wish you could take that back and have been fighting harder? 
[00:08:00]  Because it didn't feel like you were giving your ability in that moment.  It felt like, you know, because you're such a great fighter, that he caught you kind of in a moment where you shouldn't have been in that moment.  Does that make any sense?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't remember too much, because for me, it's the finish.  I have the next story now. 
[00:08:30]  It's December 10th, I have the new story for Anderson.  Sometimes you have good night in the fight, sometimes bad night in the fight.  But I'm happy because I'm complete fight now.  I'm complete attack now.  Because this is the new experience for me.  It's knock them out.  It's a new experience for you.  Does it feel odd or different to be hungry again to get the belt back? 
[00:09:00]  Because you had the most title defenses, I think, in a row.  Is it hard to stay hungry?  We talked about that before, staying hungry.  Is it hard to stay hungry, your 10th defense, as it was your first defense?  Yeah.  I'm very excited because I have the chance, I have the new chance for change my story one more time. 
[00:09:30]  The fight for the first fight for Chris Weidman is very important for my legacy.  The second fight is the more and more important.  Because in December, the new Anderson is coming because I'm more complete.  I'm ready for the new fight because I'm more complete now. 
[00:10:00]  Because occasionally, it's interesting to watch you because you can strike at will.  You throw so fast and you kick so fast.  And then sometimes you put your hands down and you hit your chest and you taunt the other guy.  Is that part of your fight game is to get into their head and frustrate them and get them to make mistakes?  Yeah, this is part of my game.  For me, it's normal.  I don't put it in this because I don't respect my opponents. 
[00:10:30]  I respect my opponents.  But this is my strategy.  It's not a lack of respect for the opponent.  It's a part of getting him to make a mistake because he's so pissed off at you.  Yes.  And it does work.  Yeah.  Sometimes working.  Sometimes working.  Other times many times.  In the United States, what we celebrate the most is when an athlete wins, then he loses, and he gets it back. 
[00:11:00]  Like, that's why Muhammad Ali is so popular.  Three times.  Lost it.  Got it back.  Just like real life.  My life is happy.  Then it's shit.  Then it's great.  Then it's shit.  Then it's lunchtime.  Yeah.  This is normal.  Win, lose, win, lose.  We love to see that.  And you will not be considered a super fighter until you have lost and won it back. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Because that is more of a...  Yeah.  This is normal.  Do you agree with this?  This is normal.  This is the real life.  This is your opportunity.  Yeah.  Because I'm a normal guy.  I'm no superhero.  I'm a normal guy.  Sometimes wins.  Sometimes no wins.  Sometimes you go for the normal life.  You go for the working.  You work in your job.  No good.  Sometimes good.  This is normal.  In the first round, was there a moment, it looked like Chris got you down and was going, 
[00:12:00]  I think, was it for a heel hook he was trying to get on?  Yeah.  Were you worried in that first round?  Because he's a very good wrestler.  And people said that he was going to try to get you on the ground and tap you.  And in that first round, I'm like, oh, he's got...  Yeah, I'm black belt Jiu Jitsu.  So, I'm black man.  I'm black man.  So, you're not worried about his wrestling?  Yeah, Chris is good wrestling and the good Jiu Jitsu training is good Jiu Jitsu for the Gracie Academy. 
[00:12:30]  But, I train hard.  I train in wrestling in my academy.  And I train Jiu Jitsu for Nogueira Brothers and Ramon Lemus, the Atos Jiu Jitsu.  I'm very, very happy for Chris giving me the chance for the new fight.  Do you have a strength coach?  Do you have a special coach for strength training and diet? 
[00:13:00]  Explain to us, what do you have?  What do you have?  Rogério Camões is my coach for 10 years.  It's my body training and my cardio.  And does he help with the food, too?  Yes.  What did you have for breakfast today?  Oh, and today is day off.  I talk to my friends now. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, come on.  It's normal breakfast.  American breakfast, please.  The guys talk to me.  Hey, I need you to take your focus because in 10 more years, you'll stand back for training.  All right.  Okay.  What's an American breakfast, though?  That's a good question.  What's a good breakfast, like a fun breakfast on a day off?  Orange juice, the eggs and bacon and fruits.  I love it. 
[00:14:00]  How about a regular training day breakfast?  Oh, no too much.  It's the eggs and little fruits and protein.  That's it.  No bacon.  Nothing.  No sugar.  No orange juice.  So have you really started training for this next fight now, or do you start?  In 10 days, I'm back for training.  How long before a fight do you start?  How many weeks before a fight?  Oh, three, four, four weeks, a month, a month. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  About a month before is when you really get serious.  And then what do you go up until like the week of?  Yep.  This is going to be, this is probably going to be, the biggest fight in UFC history before  this was the second fight with Anderson and Chael Sonnen, which the first fight was very  tough for you.  You had an injury and you tapped Chael in round five.  And then the second fight, second round win. 
[00:15:00]  This is, I think, the biggest fight in UFC history is this rematch between you and Chris  Weidman.  I want to see this more than I want to see Silva Jones.  And that's a fight I really want to see is you, John Jones.  And John Jones was very upset when you lost that fight.  One day, one day, maybe.  But you want to get through this one.  Yeah.  I take my Fox now for my rematch.  And I finish my rematch.  I talk to Dana for the future in UFC.  How much do you walk, what weight do you walk around at?  Because you're 185 when you fight, but you can, you know, 205 is light heavyweight. 
[00:15:30]  What weight do you walk around at?  188, 189.  Oh, you walk around at fighting weight?  Yeah, sometimes 205.  Okay.  I walk around at about probably 145.  I'm trying to get down to 130.  Listen to Jim, you know your way around the fight game, man.  You're pretty well up on all of this.  It's from just watching these guys, you know what I mean?  Because I do a little ab work.  You know, nothing like these guys do. 
[00:16:00]  A little bit of cardio.  Do you do interval training?  I just started doing interval training.  That's the response that deserved.  He laughed at me.  One long interval between the training sessions, huh?  Why don't you ask him if he does hot yoga while you're at it?  I've tried hot yoga.  I know you have.  I know you have.  I couldn't do it.  Yoga's good.  It's good.  Can you do hot yoga like the...  Bikram?  I can't do it.  Like Bikram?  Yeah, I talked to my mom, to my wife.  Hey, you need to practice yoga for her legs, please.  Oh, you get your wife to do it?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  So you do it or you don't?  No.  All right.  He's basically saying that.  Yeah, that's a lady.  We used to call it stretching and warming up.  Now it's called yoga and Pilates, you know.  How far do you run?  Because I can't go very far.  Yeah, sometimes.  I don't like to run.  No, I don't need it.  It sucks.  Yeah, it's too much.  So what do you do for cardio?  I train the specific training and the regular training in the academy. 
[00:17:00]  I go for the pool.  Oh, the pool?  Yeah.  But running, I don't run too much because sometimes it's different, you know, for training.  I prefer the real training for MMA.  So you basically just fight every day?  Yeah.  That's what your training is, is you fight.  You don't like a whole lot of the jogging or you don't like yoga or any of the ballet  or any of the other stuff. 
[00:17:30]  But there are guys that have said they took ballet who are in the fight game.  Boxers have taken ballet because they said it helps with the foot movement.  Yeah, I trained in ballet for a long time.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, my mom put me in ballet, but for a long time ago.  And did that help with your foot movement?  Yeah.  Now, you seem to really like kicking people.  I was watching your face.  It was in the Weidman fight in round two, and your arms were down, and you were throwing 
[00:18:00]  just very angry, like really precise leg kicks.  And it seems like you like to do that to almost punish somebody when you're not even  trying to knock them out.  It seems like there was something you just enjoy being able to kick somebody at will.  Yeah, I train hard my kicks.  You train to make your kicks hard?  Yeah, yeah.  This is normal.  It's the part, the technique, the Muay Thai technique.  And I train hard.  Are your shins tough?  Because don't Muay Thai guys kick a tree? 
[00:18:30]  Is that a rumor?  Like they say that the shins of a Muay Thai fighter, they kick like tree bark and they  kick wood to make their shins.  Is that true or is that bullshit?  Nah.  This is not real.  Oh, it's not real?  Nah.  So how do you toughen up your shins and get scar tissue on your shin?  It's the normal pad.  You kick the pad.  You train and protect your leg.  But this is not real.  Okay, I'm just watching too many movies. 
[00:19:00]  Jim, have you ever done martial arts?  No.  Have you ever taken a class?  No.  Have you ever done boxing or anything like that?  I hit the heavy bag by myself, but it makes my knuckles sore, so I stopped doing that  because I have very delicate hands and it would really bother me.  Me too.  You do really?  Yeah.  I'm joking.  I'm joking.  Oh, okay.  I'm like, no.  Jim, you'd be good at it, man.  You're feisty.  You got the energy for this.  Now, my cardio is not good, though.  I can't do good cardio.  I do the elliptical machine. 
[00:19:30]  And you could try this.  It helps a little bit.  I do 30 seconds really hard and then 30 seconds relax.  30 seconds really hard and then 30 seconds relax.  And I do that for about three minutes.  Yeah.  The sports is very important.  Your practice, the sports is very important.  It's very important for your family, for your kids.  The sports is very good.  Do you play golf?  A lot of hardcore athletes play golf.  No, I don't play golf because I don't have too much technique for playing. 
[00:20:00]  What other sports do you play to relax?  Because there's always something guys do.  I love paintball.  Paintball?  Yeah, I love it.  I love.  And sometimes I play the football.  Do you mean soccer or American football?  Soccer.  Okay.  Are you good at paintball?  Yeah, I love it.  I played it one time and I got, those things hurt when you get hit outside the pad with  a paintball.  Yeah.  I mean, maybe they don't hurt you, but they were very uncomfortable for me.  I didn't care for paintball at all.  Well, you can adjust the pressure on the gun, man.  You can turn it up to 350 pounds and it'll leave a bruise and it'll convince you to learn 
[00:20:30]  faster.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  I thought I was going to be really good at it, but I really sucked at paintball.  So now you do a whole bunch of promotion today and then where do you train?  Are you going to train in L.A. or Brazil?  I go for Thailand in 10 days.  Yeah, I go for training in my academy and then my grandmaster in Thailand.  How long will you be in Thailand? 
[00:21:00]  Oh, maybe one month.  I need to talk to my team and my master.  Is it hard?  Jim, you should tell Anderson about your trip to Brazil.  Well, I went to Rio.  Oh, it was a good city.  Yeah, I went three times and I stayed in Cobra Cabana.  Oh, good.  And yeah, I went to a club called Help.  You ever see the club Help?  Jim, you should come to Thailand with me and I'll show you some clubs. 
[00:21:30]  There was a lot of very beautiful girls.  Yeah, I'm with you, yeah.  A lot of very beautiful girls.  And I think I had to go get penicillin before I left.  I think I might have gotten a little bit of a cold or something while I was there.  I know her.  I enjoyed her very much.  Venereal Denise.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  I've never been to Thailand, though.  You know.  Sounds like you're just right.  Yeah.  I think so.  But you don't get into it.  You know, you're a family guy and, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me ask you, because I remember after the Chael Sonnen fight, your kids came out with  you on the, and it was very emotional for you.  It seemed like my kids, my son and my nephew go for the fight.  It seemed like that second win over Chael meant a lot to you, and you seemed more emotional 
[00:22:30]  than I had seen you, because he had been taunting you all the way up, and that fight was really  important.  Does this fight feel like the same kind of urgency that you felt in that fight?  Because you really wanted to beat Chael Sonnen, and you did.  Yeah.  I train hard for the fight for Chael, and it's a great fight for the story, and for me, it's  a great moment. 
[00:23:00]  My son is coming to give him the congratulations inside the octagon, and this is good, because  UFC is the, not for sports, for the specific people, it's the older people, for kids, for  family.  It's good.  I'm very happy.  Well, a lot of people call you the greatest mixed martial artist of all time.  I mean, you're certainly the most prolific title defender in the UFC, and I was really 
[00:23:30]  bummed that you lost, and I hope that you win this next fight.  It's UFC 168, it is Weidman, who's now the champion, and you're fighting to get your belt  back.  I guess we're going to see a bit more intensity in this, I hope, than the first, because you  looked prepared in the first one, just not at that one moment.  Yeah, but Chris Weidman is the new champion, the people need to respect you, but this is a 
[00:24:00]  sport, it's normal, it's the rematch, but I respect Chris.  I train hard for this fight, and I need to say thank you, Chris Weidman, thank you, Dana,  and UFC, and the people in the United States, because I live in the United States now, and  the UFC changed my life, changed the life of my kids, and my wife.  And I need to say thank you for guys in the United States, for the people in the United 
[00:24:30]  States, and I love my job, I love my working, I love UFC, I go back.  Fourth, more of the Opie and Anthony Worst of the Week Countdown, next.  The Worst of the Week Countdown, Countdown.  Highlighting all the great moments that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show, it's  the Worst of the Week Countdown with me, Sam Roberts, from the Opie and Anthony Show,  and after Opie and Anthony Live, still to come on this here Countdown, we talked to a guy  who had a giant scrotum, an appearance from Dennis Falcone, a new musical, Anthony's Trip to 
[00:25:00]  Las Vegas, and a lot more, right now, let's listen to Tom Papa, he stopped by, we thought  he was moving to Los Angeles, apparently not, he was like a week and a half ago, he told  us all he was moving, now he's back already.  He stopped by this week, and we ended up talking about old toy gun commercials, they used to  sell these toy guns based completely around being realistic, like these are the type of 
[00:25:30]  things that if they, not only is this a commercial, this is something that if you saw kids doing  now, they would be arrested on charges of terrorism, and their parents would be put in  jail for a very long time, however, in the 60s and the 70s, it was all well and good in  marketing, this is Toy Gun Commercials with Tom Papa in studio on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Find a, find a old, like machine gun, toy machine gun, 60s, 70s commercial of toy machine 
[00:26:00]  guns, because they were great, you could not get it, yeah, that top one's a good one.  You really do watch these old movies, huh?  They're dressed like bad guys, yeah, just like gangsters, in the 40s, and there's a crook  like breaking into the house, with a gun, black and white, it's also got a fucking, oh

[00:28:00]  play with, just flip up the sight, pull back the bolt, and fire, oh my god, I love this,  I want one, tell Tommy buck to your gun collection, it's like a little, I love it, what were moms  thinking when kids were running through the kitchen with this, or turn the crank for smoking  burst, the Tommy burp is really for real, right down to the adjustable flip sight, the Tommy 
[00:28:30]  burp is $2.50, the no caps, Thunderburp is $3.00, that's right, I could buy a hundred of them,  fake blood for your classmates' foreheads, cheeks, and chants, $1.72, that's right, grief  counselors not included, we used to play, we used to play war, with all the neighborhood  kids, and you'd like buy those guns, you'd get them for Christmas and whatnot, and run 
[00:29:00]  around your neighborhood, fucking going bam bam, and hiding in the bushes, and coming  out, like now, just stop, we spotted a trial with a gun in the bushes, sent down SWAT, and the  state troopers, we need two helicopters, it's just my Tommy burp, yeah, it's my Tommy burp, and the  boy was killed, we found later, he was holding a Tommy burp, it's true, I saw a kid at the bus stop  in LA, I'm in my car, and he's just running back and forth, he was probably 14, and he looked like 
[00:29:30]  spazzy, he was just running back and forth, I'm like, what is this guy up to, and he had a bag  like down on the ground, I'm like, what's in that bag, and then he started making machine gun  hands, just with his hands, and going at traffic like this, and I really was like, somebody's  gotta call someone, all he had was hands, and I'm like, this kid is gonna kill us all, this kid's  the problem, not like, uh, not like the old days, man, it's your Tommy burp, Tommy burp,  they, they were, they were, like, uh, machine guns back in the, in the day, with, like, tripod, 
[00:30:00]  bipods, and you, it's amazing, now think about that, though, like, think about how effective  that awful, awful advertising was, right, yeah, yeah, I mean, it was lame, and we were completely,  like, addicted, sure, and you had to have all that stuff, yeah, and now with it being, and  there was, and the violence was really pretty low, yeah, now with it being so sophisticated,  there's gotta be something to what it's gonna do to these kids, right, you, you would think,  I mean, we know what it did to that generation, and stuff, I mean, and, and was it, did it 
[00:30:30]  promote violence, and gun violence, and, and all that, it's, I mean, look, it, it has an  effect, they wouldn't spend all this money on it, if it, and, and right, it just got so  sophisticated, yeah, yeah, yeah, now it's Call of Duty commercials, yeah, yeah, that's true,  because they've taken pretty much all these off the market, you don't see toy guns on TV,  or even in stores, in stores, they've distorted them to the point where now they're, they look 
[00:31:00]  all goofy, and they're multicolored, nerfy, things like that, they can't look like a real  gun, right, so they've taken that off, but, yeah, when you make a real nerfy gun, though,  just to kind of blend in, you're like a real gun that looks all nerfy, call it nerfy, the  cops look, and then they go, ah, it's just one of those nerfy guns, just that, he's just  a guy that dresses up like a clown, wailing out fucking 2,000 rounds a minute, we've come 
[00:31:30]  a long way, because on Fox, there's a kid in trouble, he's nine years old, for having  a hugging contest at a school, I told him to shut up about that, Jesus, Uncle Paul,  God damn it, he decided to have a hugging contest, and now he's in deep trouble, and look what  we were just looking at, hugging contest, yeah, just a dumb hug, he decided, and we used to,  like, after Christmas, you'd get your presents and stuff, and then you'd bring some into school  after Christmas vacation, and you'd be like, oh, look, I got this and that, and you could 
[00:32:00]  walk around with toy guns in school, it's crazy, is there one more gun commercial, because  I really am enjoying those, I wonder if you, because you had guns you could act out with  that were safe, if that kind of helps in a way, yeah, yeah, I don't know, right, right,  I, I don't know, let's see what this one is, oh boy, a few weeks ago, I looked all over  the house for Billy, of course, I found out later that my son was in darkest Africa, 
[00:32:30]  uh-oh, Billy was hunting elephants with his trusty Mattel coin burp gun, that's the only  fully automatic cap gun in the world, you know, real safe, fires one shot or in burst,  oh, damn, he rocks, he never misses that girl, wow, that thing's cool, where they just go  backwards, obviously, it's so simple to play with, the safety catch keeps it from firing 
[00:33:00]  while Billy winds it, then he closes the breach, and checks his ammunition, there's plenty of  room for spare caps in the magazine, he's off again, hunting tigers in India, but don't  worry, the burp gun's so safe, it's got the parent's seal of approval, only $4, wherever  toys are sold, you can tell it's Mattel, it's swell, it's swell, and obviously it was okay  to shoot elephants, right, exactly, you would never have a commercial where a kid's shooting  elephants, they had a big screen of elephants running and him shooting them, yes, and look, 
[00:33:30]  and to go with the burp gun, try the new hook for the elephant's mouth, to teach that elephant  to behave, one slice, you can remove the tusks and send them to China, yes, make trinkets  from this regal animal, maybe a, maybe a western gun, well, we're getting a lot of requests,  someone's saying you gotta look up the enter tech water machine guns, carve his feet into 
[00:34:00]  ashtray, yes, have a laugh at the expense of the beast you've slaughtered, a real hunk  of ivory included with each, yes, leave his rotting caucas for the buzzards, while you  sell his life-fucking-saving tusks for $1.80, don't look now, here comes a poacher, shoot  him in the face, and then he's off to India, killing the last 28 tigers, look, it's an African  man with a machine gun and no shoes, holy shit, which one is this, it's a request, let's 
[00:34:30]  see, it's a, all right, yeah, this looks no other machine gun, I think these are the guns  that they used in the movie Airheads, oh, in living color, the feel, the sound, the real,  and the time, the AK Centerfire, automatic water weapon, batteries not included, with up to  30 feet of firing power, an extra clip for reloading, a shoulder strap for moving out, 
[00:35:00]  there's also the M16 rifle, the sidekick pistol, the RPG rocket water weapon, the AK Centerfire,  so look, the feel, the sound, so real, that's pretty cool, that's like 80s, right, yeah,  that was 80s, probably the 80s, I'm sure there was some complaints about that one, it's starting  to roll in, not like the old one, the old ones are like, ah, that's not violent enough,  yes, exactly, let's have to shoot elephants, yes, yes, shooting elephants, see if you can 
[00:35:30]  have him aiming that burp gun at the Negro family moving in next door, stop, oh, this  is one of the Western ones, yeah, oh, the rifle that won the West, yes, won the West, killing  Indians, oh, nice lever action, it loads just like the real one, wow, even ejects the shells, 
[00:36:00]  cool, I would so have that, kids running with a little cowboy outfit on, yeah, you find a  rock shooting at the indigenous people of America, people who are living off the land,  minding their own business, exactly, and look, some sugar that looks like anthrax to put  in a blanket, yeah, they're not really showing what the shooting apple, we all know, we all  know, we all know, someone darker than you, yes, oh, boy, his skin has been stained by darkness,

You can also catch me on NotSam.com.  We highlight the very best things that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:41:30]  Still to come, a guy with a giant scrotum, Roland.  He's not the guy with the giant scrotum, but he was also in studio.  He thought he lost his job.  Hilarious.  Anthony's trip to Las Vegas, and a whole lot more.  Right now, we have an appearance from the great Dennis Falcone, radio legend Denny.  He stops by to regale us with tales of old-school radio and to try to sell us on how great things used to be.  We found out that Dennis collects jingles. 
[00:42:00]  Like, you know radio jingles?  Like, you know, WABC?  Like, he collects packages of jingles.  He has them.  And he just, I don't know, listens to them.  And he brought in a disc of his favorite jingles.  I don't know what psychosis goes through this man's head, but you listen to him.  It's Dennis Falcone on The Worst of the Week Countdown.  Oh, man. 
[00:42:30]  Denny's radio jingle package.  Nice.  Did he handpick these?  No, well, these are the jingles he really, really likes that he had to collect.  But, yeah, he had to collect and trade for them.  Right, right, right.  What made that any different than any other jingle?  I don't know.  Maybe he could come in here and explain quickly. 
[00:43:00]  I mean, fucking email the explanation to Sam.  He'll read it.  What's good about that?  He collects these.  Like, why is that better than anything else?  Ladies and gentlemen, the good times are back.  C-K-L-W.  The Motor City.  Sound like Cousin Brucie. 
[00:43:30]  Oh.  Denny's back.  Was that Cousin Brucie?  Denny?  Was Cousin Brucie in one of those?  No.  There's no way you collect radio jingles, Denny.  Yeah.  I have like a 10 CD.  There's a 10 volume set that Pam sold.  He's got a 10 volume set.  Sam wrote these down.  Sal wrote these down.  Just wrote the list.  Sal?  Sal.  Sal.  He brought in a track list.  The K-I-L-T one was the one I was thinking of before. 
[00:44:00]  That's known as the C-I-L-T.  Because that's what you should be for having these.  Wait.  You like the K-I-L-T?  Why?  The WPIX FM in New York used to use that one.  And you could.  The top of the hour jingle is.  You could talk it up.  It has, I think, a five second ramp.  Coming up this weekend.  It's a pick a ticket weekend.  You get the chance to grab tickets for a three dog night in concert, baby.  K-I-L-T.  Wow.  Yeah.  And, you know, you'd go right out of the spot set or something. 
[00:44:30]  I talk about the jingle.  I understand that they're out there.  Yeah.  And it helps the station a little bit.  Fine.  A lot.  Why are you collecting these things?  They were great.  I love the 90s.  It's an excellent, too.  K-A-K-C.  You collected that.  Yeah, it's nice.  No, it's not.  I just like the vocal.  I like the WABC chime one.  That's probably one of the most popular jingles of all time.  Number five.  WABC.  WABC Chime Time.  You know, these things. 
[00:45:00]  Chime, Chime Time.  Why?  Oh, boy.  And the 99X shotgun.  That was the only jingle they used.  That was a great one.  I listened to 99X growing up.  Yeah, it was a great jingle.  99X.  Just love the drums.  Where's the shotgun?  Well, that's what it's called.  That's called a shotgun jingle.  Unfortunately, not in his mouth.  Exactly.  It should be a fucking shotgun when they run out of the horse.  CKLW is a great station.  Why do you have these?  Why not?  I have no concept of why you would. 
[00:45:30]  When would you listen to these?  Like, what would your other option be?  Maybe Friday night when you go out of the air.  You'd have an air checks and jingle party with the other jocks.  A jingle party.  I'd rather go to a lemon party.  I'd rather go to a fucking safest cartel party as the guest of honor.  You know, and we'd trade them.  Hey, do you have anything from California or anything from Chicago?  I'm looking for WLS or something.  I'm asked a lot if you're a bit.  And I have to tell people over and over again that you're not a bit.  I love this stuff. 
[00:46:00]  But now I think you're fucking fabricating.  No, no, I'm not.  You've never had a jingle party.  Oh, yeah.  The guys would get back in the 70s, you know, when you're younger or something.  But how does that discussion come up?  What goes on?  What goes on at a jingle party?  We're going to get together Friday night.  You know, you want to be a Friday night?  Maybe a Tuesday.  He said when you were younger, though.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's like, you know, when you're younger, that's the type of stuff you're going to do  on a Friday night.  As opposed to fucking a woman, do you want to come over and listen to FM, Tong, pick  up a pizza, go through some jingles, I'll trade you something. 
[00:46:30]  But you know, when you get a party together, you go, all right, what are you bringing?  So in this case, what?  I'm bringing the WABC jingle.  What do you got?  What do you bring to the jingle party?  I got something special for you.  I got some great stuff from KING Seattle.  What?  I'd rather go to a fucking party where they say, we're going to lock ourselves in the bathroom  and drop a hornet's nest on the floor.  After Bill stinks it up with a good shit, we're going to open a hornet's nest and get  stung while breathing in his shit films.  And back then, these guys don't take it seriously. 
[00:47:00]  I don't know.  Why?  We've never taken radio seriously, obviously.  And you see, back then, you only had this stuff on cassette or reel-to-reel.  Of course.  And you'd rack them up on the big Ampex machine or something.  It should have never been on cassette or reel-to-reel.  No, no.  It's a great stuff.  There should be.  Matter of fact, Jonathan Wolford from Jams and Pam, he has a 10-volume set CD that you  can buy.  Really?  It's great.  How much is it?  That's a couple hundred dollars, maybe $99.  I remember a friend of mine.  $99?  His wife got it for his 50th birthday party. 
[00:47:30]  For his 50th birthday.  He was excited.  Did he divorce her?  I can't believe she got me.  Yeah, exactly.  What a bitch.  Jesus.  Horrible.  And it's got all the WABC jingles, all the different packages.  You're at the jingle party.  Then what?  You all take turns playing what you found?  Yeah.  What do you got?  Oh, I got something from Chicago.  Was there beer at least?  Yeah, you got beer.  Oh, yeah.  Things are going to get crazy.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Get drunk.  Crazy.  They're going to get crazy.  How many beers could you drink at a single jingle party?  Well, it wasn't about getting drunk.  It was about, you know, what you went home with.  40 before you got there just to get through it.  I've been looking for something from, you know, maybe a Canadian radio station. 
[00:48:00]  Do you have anything?  And, oh, yeah, we got something for you.  Just to have these.  W-B-O-R-E.  There's a lot of jingle freaks out there.  No, there are.  Oh, yeah.  There's not.  No, there are.  There are.  That's a terrible party on a Friday night.  Terrible.  I get it.  It wasn't, you know.  Let's go to Dale in Texas.  Dale.  Dale.  That's my friend.  Danny, did you ever send away for any of the live baby chicks that some of the stations  used to give away?  No, I never did that. 
[00:48:30]  What's that?  Do you even know, Danny?  That doesn't sound good.  What's that about, Dale?  Sounds mean.  Well, they used to give away, or you could buy them.  You could buy like 100 or 500 baby chicks for a very low price.  It was a radio giveaway.  I mean, don't you guys ever remember talking to Lee Abrams about radio history?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, Lee was a good guy to talk about.  Yeah, Lee was great.  But he knew it was terrible.  Yeah, that's why he wanted to do things differently.  He hated all this stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And the company hated him and said, beat it. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  That was smart, huh?  Yeah, but these things were just fun.  Do you miss that that doesn't happen in radio anymore?  That there are...  Well, yeah, it was part of listener, you know, just recalling the station.  W-H-B-Q.  People would sing the jingle after a while.  It would just be ingrained in their head.  W-A-B-C, boom.  You know, W-H-B-Q.  It was just ingrained in their heads.  Fine, but you don't need to collect them.  It was part of the fabric.  W-H-B-Q.  We have jingle parties at Anthony's house, except instead of playing jingles, there's  one man drinking alcohol and doing Michael Richards' Laugh Factory set in the swimming pool. 
[00:49:30]  I mean, look, a lot of guys collected baseball cards, comic books, figures or something.  Things that are worth money, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  But the party atmosphere just sounds...  I'm amazed by it.  E-Rock, do you have the famous Opie and Anthony jingle?  There can't be that many people to have a party.  In depth, I mean, do you miss the...  Jocks at the radio.  I wish they can't like the heaven skate party.  Brad Dump had a better party in his bedroom with a hibachi.  I mean, to this day, a buddy of mine will send me an air check, you know, on email. 
[00:50:00]  Hey, I got a great air check of, you know, Opie or something when he worked at the...  Oh, hey.  Things like that.  But the young camaraderie is not there anymore.  Right, because unfortunately, there's not a lot of jocks at radio stations at the radio.  No.  Wait, where's our...  The voice track.  I'm trying to play our great jingle.  Well, play the one you found, E-Rock, but I'm...  This is great.  Oh, I got it.  Jam song?  I got it. 
[00:50:30]  But this is the greatest jingle of all time right here.  Suck my fucking cock. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, that could work, Sam.  What I love about the show, you never know where this shit's going.  We're just on a little ride every morning.  Oh, sure.  We've got to bring back the jingle contest.  We weren't thinking about the jingle contest, and now I'm thinking we've got to bring it back.  We had so much trouble, though, because so many people mistake it for a song pairing contest.  And they make songs because they don't know what jingles are.  You have to tell them a limit on it. 
[00:51:30]  You have to give them a time limit.  Yes.  Five, ten seconds.  Ten seconds.  The best jingles are the shortest ones.  This is a ten-second contest, and it's jingles like this.  W-R-K-O, Boston.  Oh, yeah.  Those are great voices.  Those are great voices.  Who cares?  But it's who cares?  You like the smooth jingle voice.  I love the K-I-L tilt.  That's great.  You guys would get through this awful, like that moment right there.  What would you do at the party?  All right, here it goes.  Hold on, hold on.  Listen to this.  There you go. 
[00:52:00]  And you'd play J-Y-A-N-O, Fresno.  It's like being in Fresno.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You're there.  It sounded like the Boston one.  Yeah.  Well, that's it.  Because you could get, you know, you'd listen to it.  You'd work at some small stations and say, gee, I want the jingle just like that.  Yeah, and then you fucking rip them off.  Because radio's filled with assholes that just rip off other guys.  Because they steal other people's shit.  Fuck them all.  Like Elvis did.  I mean.  J-C-C-L, Sacramento.  So did you kind of realize that they're all the same and none of them have any local character whatsoever?  Should they say the town in there? 
[00:52:30]  That's your local flavor.  Some jingles would.  You know, I mean, I think W-Y-N-Y in New York back in the 70s had a package geared for New York.  But the songs went on too long.  Uh-huh.  Driving along, singing a song.  And you're stopping for coffee.  You're playing the songs.  After a while, it would just be kind of annoying.  I like the one.  What do they have?  The one on 60s on 6, I guess it is, about turning over.  You've got to turn so you don't burn.  Oh, turn to burn.  Yeah, on the beach, you'd hear it. 
[00:53:00]  And it'd be like, you know, turn so you don't burn.  Roll your bod.  Yeah, and you'd be like, oh.  See, that's a jingle thing.  But it also helps the people listening at the beach.  Yes, it does.  It reminds them, like, oh, shit, I'd better turn over.  I just love that K-I-L-T one.  Boy, I could play that one over and over.  Boy, he loves that K-I-L-T one.  Actually, I wanted that talk up there right in the beginning.  Well, you could just talk it up.  Hey, coming up after Opie and Anthony today, it's Jim Norton.  So make sure you stay here on the ONA channel, baby.  We got it.  Can I talk one up? 
[00:53:30]  Can I do the K-I-L-T one?  Sure, Jimmy.  You sure can.  I don't think this is going to be nice.  We're going to play a Gladys Knight song and fake like we know a Negro from her band.  We're liars.  There you go.  See, you got it.  You nailed it.  You nailed it.  You should be doing some Shotgun Radio.  That's called Shotgun Radio.  I could talk to the guys on the 60s.  I might have an in for you there, you know?  Shotgun.  Oh, my God.  You have to have something like Big Jim Norton or something.  Big Jim Norton.  Jim and Jim Norton.  Sinless Jimmy. 
[00:54:00]  Something like that is always fun.  But that song, then they did a five-minute song where they sang all the jingles in it.  Who?  How was it?  Jam.  Jam Productions.  Jam Productions.  You got it?  Oh, yeah.  Of course I got it.  Wait, and you like this?  It's a five-minute song.  Listen to this thing.  Listen to this.  I'd rather hear Making Out by Mad Magazine.  Oh, Making Out.  Jam Productions.  This is in it.  It's in.  Horrible.  It's nice.  Oh, this looks old.  This is in the early 80s. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  No.  It doesn't sound like it.  And it means a lot to me.  Sounds like a montage, an 80s movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like you're working out.  Yeah.  Trying to learn something.  You see Gina opening up her fucking beauty shop.  Yeah.  A tiger in Tony's house.  It's all across the nation when I hear a station.  I wonder which one is this.  Here we go.  Listen to this.  That's why we sing the jingles.  And Jam is proud to say. 
[00:55:00]  We're the voice of these radio IDs heard across the USA.  WPLJ.  USA.  It's all fame.  WPLJ.  KRBE.  Oof.  I'm stunned here. 
[00:55:30]  You like this?  He is.  Denny's bopping his head and smiling.  He's loving this.  I hope he is sort of perplexed.  Waking you up with a.  What do you mean?  The morning zoo cruise zoo 101.6.  Look at him in the studio recording their jingles.  This is great stuff.  That was a good one.  Rock and play.  Throwing all hit points.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Oh.  We're the calling games and the DJ mix.  The excitement on the air. 
[00:56:00]  We're the clock and count.  This still has over three minutes left.  Oh my God.  This is so like the jam band of jingle songs.  A lot of Z's.  Yeah.  For a reason.  Do you just like anything that mentions a lot of radio stuff?  Yeah.  Wow. 
[00:56:30]  Oh my God.  And the coolest thing is if I can get every bumper sticker to match the jingle.  Yes.  Oh, WMBC.  Exactly.  Do you like K-Y-G-O?  Oh, this is a.  It's got to be over.  It's smooth.  It's not half over.  It's not half over.  What?  There's more than half over.  Oh my God. 
[00:57:00]  This is crazy.  Everybody.  There we go.  Look at the tape machine spinning.  Hot, hot, hot.  Nice.  From the community bulletin board music back there.  How do you know that?  And Mark Parenteau is diddling a boy.  His finger smells like shit and cocoa butter.  There's almost 23,000 views on it. 
[00:57:30]  Oh.  They're all from him.  Yeah.  A lot of the comments are like, that was fun, this and that.  Oh, God.  But of course, there's the one guy that just writes fake and gay.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  He's a real party pooper.  That's actually the name of the song.  Oh, Christ.  We can't do it.  Wow.  It's just going and going.  We still know there's too many times.  Uh, da, da, da, da.  Oh.  K-W-K.  M-U-K-O-V-O-A.  Fucking child.  This is. 
[00:58:00]  K-U-B-E.  Who even knows this existed?  And now they're unemployed.  Yeah.  I have a Vinyl 45.  Oh, you do?  In a picture sleeve.  Yeah.  What's the picture?  In a picture sleeve.  What's the picture?  But I have it in a plastic sleeve.  Should be a guy swinging by the neck.  With fucking headphones on.  And you don't play it, right?  You want to keep it in.  I transferred it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I transferred it to mini disc back in the day.  Where is this from?  The 80s?  Yeah, early 80s.  This is just fantastic.  Oh, Tom Likas is beating his wife on the head in the fireplace on Christmas Eve. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, my God.  This is great.  Where's it?  How many times have you listened to this?  I don't know.  I mean, I haven't listened to it a while.  Over the years?  Who brought this to the party?  What's that?  Who brought this to the...  Well, what you would do is you'd call up the jingle companies and say,  Hi, we're considering getting some new jingles.  And could you send us some samplers?  Especially the explosive package.  We'd really like to hear these are things that you just wanted. 
[00:59:00]  Diarrhea?  And you'd get them, you know, from real to real.  I wish you'd write that to Ted Kizinski.  It was just a lot of good, clean fun.  That's all it was.  I wish Denny is like Cliff in the Memphis Mafia.  Oh, man, right?  Just getting free jingles instead of coax.  What's going on now?  You know Denny.  You know Denny.  It's just some studio stuff.  94 Ticks.  Just the guys sitting in the gym.  Look at that.  They're in the studios, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's nice to see them in there.  It's raw.  That would have been the, I always wanted to take a trip there.  94 Ticks.  Yes.  That'd be great if they were doing it in the Waco compound. 
[00:59:30]  And all the junior companies are only in Texas.  Dulles.  Oh, yeah?  They always used to say copyright 1881.  Dulles.  Jam production.  It's great stuff.  You don't think that sounds outdated now?  No, no.  Sometimes Jonathan Wolford, who's the president of that company, comes up and he visits Cousin  Brucie and Art Vulo, radio's best friend.  Is Art Vulo ever stop up here?  Oh, God.  Art's great.  Art makes all the videos.  Makes all the different videos.  Does he?  You don't want to rip that down onto your radio?  Now you get the hell out of here! 
[01:00:00]  Thank you so much again, Denny.  Thank you.  Always a pleasure.  Always a pleasure.  Turning us on to...  After all these years, we're trying to learn about radio and appreciate the history of it,  and thank God you're around to do that for us.

Moving right along with the worst of the week countdown.  I am Sam Roberts from Opie and Anthony, and after Opie and Anthony live, 
[01:04:30]  highlighting the very best moments that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony show.  Still to come, we'll hear from Roland.  Roland thought he lost his job this week.  He just panics all the time.  Some guy with a giant scrotum.  In studio, Ant goes over his trip to Las Vegas and a whole lot more.  But first, while Ant was in Las Vegas, he discovered a new musical.  Advertisements for a new musical.  And of course, being the intelligent man that he is, 
[01:05:00]  the curious by nature man that he is.  Not bi-curious, but curious.  No, not like butt, not with two Ts.  He, Anthony, decided to look up, see if he could find any YouTube clips of this musical,  and we found him introducing Menopause the Musical.  There was a show in Vegas that I was just like, I saw this billboard for it,  and was like, oh, it was called Menopause the Musical. 
[01:05:30]  No.  And there's just a bunch of old ladies, like, laughing.  Oh, yes.  Just having fun with their dried cunts.  Yes, yes.  How do you make dried cunts fun?  They couldn't.  It was so bad.  Did you go to the show?  No, but there's a preview.  You should have went to the show.  There's a preview that shows all you need to know about Menopause the Musical.  Please, I need to see this.  It is so bad.  I don't know if they have the preview there, or is it, um... 
[01:06:00]  You got anything possibly there on...  See, look there.  But I found out, no, it's just a part of the change.  The change.  My body tried to warn me.  Ew.  Ooh, the signs weren't too cool.  Oh.  It's treating me mean, yeah.  Fuckin' menopause women in the background. 
[01:06:30]  Change, change, change.  See, and they do, like, parodies.  Oh, I get it.  Oh, I get it.  Change of life.  Well, it's not alright.  Not okay.  And you can look the other way.  I have to try to understand.  It's not no content for a man.  Whether you're a sister or a mother, you're staying away.  Staying away.  Keep this little energy and you're up.  She's just, oh no, can you, she's singing about her barren room.  No reason to be alive.  No reason to be alive. 
[01:07:00]  No reason to be alive.  No reason to be alive.  And they're just these house-browl women.  Are they on your side?  Oh, no, don't be deceived.  Isn't this douche-chillish?  Well, you can make believe if you wanna know  where the fat grams go, it's on my hips.  Oh, it's on my hips.  Isn't this great?  It's good. 
[01:07:30]  There's not a bit of fucking vaginal lubrication in the audience, either.  Not at all.  Every show in Vegas has to be sold out for you to possibly go.  Let's go see this thing.  Let's go see Menopause the Musical.  Menopause the Musical, yeah.  Dude, there's another preview or something on YouTube.  Just, uh, not on their site, but on YouTube.  If you put in Menopause the Musical, I...  Oh, wait.  There I am.  Oh, no.  Praying for this moment to pass. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Drowning on the sheets I just changed.  Nightshirt is rinsed.  Feeling deep.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You've got that night sweatin', night sweatin'.  Night sweatin'.  Night sweatin'.  This is a comedy, though, right?  It's supposed to be a comedy.  That shouldn't be a question, Jimmy.  Louder than I talk.  The swishing when I walk. 
[01:08:30]  They're my thighs.  Oh, there are thighs now.  The queen's thighs, can you please?  Or the crutches at my feet.  I'm getting no guys.  No guys.  I use no flap ointens by the jar.  My spandex jeans won't stretch the car.  Because she's fat.  Yeah.  Because her womb dried up.  Yeah.  And now she's getting a man body.  Oh, my ovaries.  My clit's dry. 
[01:09:00]  You could blow on my clit and make a wish, and it would be like one of those little things that  blow this apart.  No matter how I try to keep a narrow path, I wander blindly through a maze.  I've been swept all through this vortex world.  It happens to all of us, girls.  Oh.  I just can't wait to get back to the place where there's an order right in my world.  I wish we all could be sane and normal. 
[01:09:30]  I wish we all could be sane and normal.  I wish we all could be sane and normal.  Yeah.  Oh, a little beach boy.  I wish that we could still be vital.  I wish that we...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I saw the billboard, and we became obsessed with it.  Of course.  And watched YouTube previews and interviews with the audience afterwards, and they're like... 
[01:10:00]  And the men show up, too, the husbands, and you'll see them in the audience nudging the  wife, going, that's you, that's you.  Is this it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, yeah, yeah.  Start it over there, Sam, please.  It's so bad.  Oh, my sister's texting.  Why?  Oh, no.  Make it stop me.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah.  This could be the douchiest thing ever produced.  I love it so far.  Do you?  Yes.  It's great. 
[01:10:30]  Let it rip.  Let's see what, um...  Met applause to musicals.  All right.  And they're holding up giant panties.  Change, change, change.  Change, change, change.  Change, change, change.  Change of life.  Change of life.  I had a hot flash for a nice slip.  Everybody knew about it, because I'm a relatively vocal person.  Look at that.  And so I kind of thought, that's how it was for everybody.  And I didn't realize that menopause was, in fact, in the closet. 
[01:11:00]  And what the show has done is offered women a point of relationship so that they...  The second menopause runs out of my closet, it's over, Johnny.  Well, yeah, actually, it's a big secret.  It's not a secret.  You look at their lips, and if they're dried out, it means their pussies are dried.  When you're going through something like this, what happens is, you know, you have a hot  size shot.  The lips look like a dried-out riverbed.  You know, this is the problem there.  It's like, yeah, me too.  But when you're sitting in an audience, and there's 300 men, and they're all screaming, 
[01:11:30]  that's me, that's me.  Oh, are they?  And all of a sudden, you know that you're not alone out there.  And I get emails all the time that say, thank you for letting me know I'm normal.  And I'm taking my husband, so he understands what I'm going through.  They've got the sassy black woman, and then the varying ages.  Probably the most important thing to know about my show is, Menopause the Musical was  never written to be about theater.  Let's face it, it's not Macbeth. 
[01:12:00]  Menopause the Musical was written to be about women, and the great thing about it is, across  the country, women get it.  But it's, on the other hand, have no clue.  And they give out little fans.  They give out those little fans, so they can fan themselves in the audience when they  get their hot flashes.  No matter what they say about it in their reviews, they have to finish it off by saying  Look at the audience, it's just old house frowns.  They laugh, and you're right there, and they're talking about what you're going through, and  it was just, it was great, it was great.  I lived in New York, and I saw all the Broadway shows, this is even better than that. 
[01:12:30]  What shows did you see?  Finally, we have something that recognizes women's problems, women's growth.  Women's growth.  It's not growth.  It's gross.  Independence.  Exactly.  Give it a fucking mammogram.  I'm just so tired of not sleeping.  Uh-oh, here it is.  Well, you can tell by the way I slump my walk.  I'm a tired girl, no strength to talk.  In the mirror, my eyes so red.  I've been up all night, sitting in my bed. 
[01:13:00]  And that's not a bad thing.  My mood is dry, I should be dead.  My husband tries to understand.  Just no concept for a man.  My country's all dry, and I'm really cranked.  You just put a gun in my mouth.  A gun in my mouth.  I started a show three years ago, when I was actually at the start of menopause.  And so it has helped me just to deal with it and just to know that it's something that everybody else in the whole world has or is going through or will go through. 
[01:13:30]  And that's the way the audience is, too.  Everyone out there has maybe a mother, a wife, a sister, somebody that is going through menopause or has.  Right, we get it.  It helps the younger ones understand mom better.  It helps husbands understand their wives better.  Here's what happens to your vagina.  Exactly.  You know the old adage, laughter is the best medicine, really, really works with this show.  Mommy, what's menopause?  All right, let me peel this apple and leave it out for a week.  It's a little demonstration. 
[01:14:00]  Staying awake, see the summer's breaking and you're up, cooking bacon and you're staying awake, staying awake.  Those first few shows, we were astounded every night at the things that people loved that we thought were great, but we didn't know how great they were until we got the response from the audience.  Why? Why is this video so long?  It's forever.  I'd rather go back to the Elvis channel.  Sweet Sweaty Woman.  Come on.  Is this the one you were looking at online?  Oh, yeah.  I was fascinated.  Of course.  Night Sweatin'. 
[01:14:30]  Night Sweatin'.  Oh.  We all hired David.  Oh.  Because we bring together all the things that happened to women.  The choreography's terrific.  Oh, isn't it?  I hate to smell that wardrobe when they're done for a couple of command performances.  Oh, you had that, too?  Oh, that happens to me.  Has that happened to you?  Oh, right.  It happens to me.  Yeah, we get it.  Exactly.  I don't like any black woman with hair like David Cassidy.  We might as well celebrate it.  She's awful.  Something I can do because it sticks like glue.  It's my cunt. 
[01:15:00]  My cunt.  It's dry and it's awful and it smells like a horse's gum.  These are teeny twiggy natures that we call them in our songs.  Jesus.  All my cast members are, when we do our calls, they're 40 years and above and they're 5, 10  and above so that they can relate to exactly what they're talking about.  Yes, they're not going to hire any, you know, than actresses for this.  Oh, look at that audience.  Look at this poor fuck.  There's a guy there, yeah.  This fucking asleep, man. 
[01:15:30]  This pussy that got dragged to this.  Reaching for the fucking trigger with his toe right now.  All this is happening.  Oh, that poor guy.  He's like, yeah, fuck with Penn and Teller.  I don't want to go see them.  I'll go see fucking Menopause, the musical.  Exactly.  For a few minutes, felt like the minority in there, but it was a very great performance.  Very funny.  And the song, glad I came.  Going to go home and drink poison.  I was sitting there thinking, what are they laughing about?  You mean nothing dries up? 
[01:16:00]  I elbowed my wife at her one good breath and I said, remember what happened to you, honey?  Oh, God, she's saying to a guy in the audience.  Yeah, she's getting all sexy with a guy in the audience.  That's great.  She sits on his colostomy.  It's the only lubrication she's had.  The old guy just came in his pants.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm not the only one. 
[01:16:30]  Wow.  I had a great time.  I felt like I died and going to heaven there for a minute.  Wow, that'll be happening soon.  What's going on with their lives.  Sort it off.  And we can even see them in the audience.  Sometimes, you know, the men will start out, you know, thinking, okay, I'm really uncomfortable about this.  Yeah, that we show up and their dicks actually leap off their bodies and jump down the sewer.  And about halfway through the show, they're nudging the wife and that's you up there and, you know, laughing.  Yeah, imagine that.  And sometimes we can hear the men over the women.  Oh.  Because they recognize their wife. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, my God, they're still talking about it.  Still.  It's like they're talking about Les Mis on Broadway.  This is actually off the strip.  It's at the Pig Hotel.  This whole promo could be our cunts are dry.  We're going to sing about it.  Yeah.  That's the theme of the hotel.  It's menopause.  Every machine, it's like an old crinkly arm instead of a fucking slot handle.  And the fucking thing that the money comes out of is like a dried vagina.  And you never win anything. 
[01:17:30]  It's always dried cherries.  I think one of the reasons I make is that the women who come for the first time,  when they come back again, and they usually do, they come back with other people.  They don't just send people to the show.  They bring people to the show.  Oh, you've got to.  It's something that I think I would want to come back and see several times.  Two bottles of water, one for a mouth, one for a tongue.  There's so much there that you want to keep seeing.  Seeing it and picking up the nuances that you've missed.  The nuances.  And it's like a mirror.  You see yourself, you see what you've got. 
[01:18:00]  It's a woman who will say, Bob Ucker.  Absolutely.  This is the third time for me.  Oh, boy.  Every time, I do something different.  Do you?  Yeah.  Menopause, the musical.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah.  Menopause before they go in there.  Take it over, dummies.  Oh, horrible.  Man.  I was fascinated with it.  Every time we drove down, what was it, Tropicana or something, they just had that billboard. 
[01:18:30]  It was all lit up.  And it was like this woman's laughing, this post-menopausal woman just laughing with the  big, funny lettering, menopause, the musical.  We get out of the tub in The Shining, The Shining.  We got a guy on the line that lost his job over menopause, the musical.  How does that happen?  Come on.  There's no way.  Okay.  Prostate cancer.  The musical director here.  It got run out of Dodge by that new hot show. 
[01:19:00]  Nate in Chicago.  Nate in Chicago.  Amen.  I was doing Second City in Cleveland.  We had a Second City in Cleveland for a few brief years.  Yeah.  And they called us in for a meeting one morning, and we were all excited, thought we were getting  a new director.  And they started the meeting off by saying, you're selling more tickets than ever before,  but the board's full on the plug, and we're replacing you with menopause, the musical.  Oh, God.  Wow.  So they threw you guys out.  So it hit the road.  Yeah.  We had 30 days left.  We had to finish out our show, and they said 75% of all theatergoers are females, so it's 
[01:19:30]  much better.  Yeah.  I'm writing my new show, Ovarian Fibroid Tumors, the comedy.  That's fascinating, Nate.  Thank you.  Starting the Waynes Brothers as the tumors.  Stevie Knight, who's a good egg on the Twitter, tweets, alternate title, the dead vagina model.  I couldn't get it out.  How did we miss that one? 
[01:20:00]  Oh, that's fucking, it's got to be horrible.  Yeah.  It boomed like a paper bag, like a brown paper bag, and you could hear it crinkling.  Yeah, if you're hyperventilating, you had to put your face in her crotch.  All the fucking woman organs are like Chex Mix at that point, just fucking, just terrible.  Yeah, when she jumps up and down the inside of her, rattles like a fucking, like a bowl  of those fucking goldfish food.

Still to come, highlighting the very best moments on the Opie and Anthony show.  A guy with a giant scrotum in studio, and Roland thought he lost his job. 
[01:25:30]  We were watching him panic for a while.  But first, Anthony, millionaire that he is, decided to take the vacation that we had last week and spend it in Las Vegas.  And boy, did he spend.  Anthony regales us with tales of a vacation that none of us will ever be able to afford.  We can live vicariously through this man, though.  It's Anthony in Las Vegas on the countdown.  Number three. 
[01:26:00]  It looked like you had a nice relaxing week in Vegas.  Oh, it was so nice.  Gambling, hanging by the pool.  Acting lessons, dancing lessons.  I think you went to a drive-in, it looked like.  I went to a drive-in movie.  Did you really?  Yeah, there ain't many drive-ins left in the nation.  And they got a big, in Vegas, they got a big drive-in movie complex.  Did you have to put the speaker in, or it's now on the FM dial?  I was telling my girly about that whole speaker thing, and she laughed at it.  She couldn't even fathom the fucking speaker. 
[01:26:30]  You had to yank a big, metal fucking speaker into your window.  Oh, you used to have to bring it in.  Whose job is it to check that?  Oh, boy.  We don't have interns anymore.  That would have been a good one.  I was going to do like a, how it used to sound with the, um.  Right.  Yeah.  We still have an intern.  We do.  Fucking young guy.  What's his name?  Because of the T.  I don't know his name.  Tyler.  Tyler.  Sure.  Okay.  Tyler Fried Chicken.  We lost to two broads. 
[01:27:00]  We're down on the one guy, right?  I miss Jackie's last day.  It was heartbreaking.  Oh, boy.  It was a great send-off.  Did she have a banner send-off?  Did she?  Yeah.  She got serenaded by Ryan Starr.  Ryan Starr was singing to her.  She loved her.  She was crying.  She was crying.  I adore her.  Her mom was here with her.  Oh, her mom did come in.  She got a little teary-eyed.  You know, I don't want to misrepresent it.  And the mom was very doable.  Very doable.  Very doable.  Absolutely. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, so that was fun.  But, yeah, drive-in movie, man.  I saw that horrible movie.  Which one?  That one with fucking Matt Damon.  Elysium.  Elysium.  Oh, Elysium.  Elysium.  Was it good?  Oh, it's just, it's such fucking liberal cock-suck drivel.  That is like, and I don't even mind, like, if a movie is slanted liberal, because most  of them are, and if it's well done.  But this was so obvious.  Oh, look out! 
[01:28:00]  The rich people live in the luxurious, spacey place.  And on the earth, in the shit and filth and litter and poverty, are a bunch of black people.  Ah, they're running around, but they'll get them.  It's exactly what it was.  You don't like the simplicity of the message, the obviousness of the message.  It's so obvious and so simplistic.  All I was thinking when I'm watching the impoverished people of earth, instead of the rich corporate  scum on their little space thing, was, why don't they all pick up a piece of paper off 
[01:28:30]  the fucking street so it cleans it up a little bit?  You live on earth!  Clean it!  I'm yelling at the drive-in.  Yeah, but I forgot how that drive-in experience works.  You gotta get a Disney movie or something.  Something nice and easy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Going to a drive-in.  There wasn't much to choose from.  There wasn't much out.  Her being the love bug.  The love bug.  Well, that's kind of what I remember seeing. 
[01:29:00]  And not the one with fucking Lindsay Lohan, either.  Who looks like she got her shit together.  As I was going in for her.  Did she?  Yeah.  I don't know.  We'll see.  But I was watching the Oprah interview as I was falling asleep last time.  I'm like, that's the same Lindsay Lohan?  She must have pulled into that makeup room like a pit crew.  Please, Oprah.  She looks really healthy.  Yeah.  Because we have beat the shit out of her over the years.  She looks really, really healthy and together.  Yeah.  Hopefully she won't go back to her old ways.  This is her.  Yeah, I hope she does. 
[01:29:30]  What was really annoying was the fact that she got away with everything before she fucking ran  somebody over.  It's like, good for you.  I hope she gets sober.  She owned up to a lot of things.  But I think Oprah asked her about cocaine.  And she said she only did it 10 to 15 times in her entire life.  That's hard to...  Co-fucking-cane?  She said her thing is drinking.  And the reason she did the drinking, the cocaine, was so she could drink longer and stay up  longer.  That's a good strategy.  I've actually heard that from many, many people.  She's a smart girl right there.  That really wasn't her thing, cocaine. 
[01:30:00]  She said 10 to 15 times she admitted to.  And the Adderall, she said she was on.  Yeah, Adderall, huh?  But it was mostly a drinking thing with her.  You know what?  I hope she does all right.  I think you need more than an interview.  You were paid $2 million.  Oh, I know.  I know.  To show that you're back.  But Oprah's not an easy...  She doesn't let you get away with shit, really.  $2 million.  She's a very good...  Yeah, she got $2 million for the interview, and she's doing an eight-part reality series  for Oprah's channel. 
[01:30:30]  She got $2 million, though.  Yeah.  For the whole thing, or just the interview?  The whole thing, probably.  Wow.  You know, we beat up Oprah, too, but she knows how to interview somebody.  I heard it was not exclusive.  She doesn't let you off the hook.  No?  I heard it was just not...  It was just to get, as they say, eyeballs on her channel.  That's what it was for.  Right, right, right.  Just to get people watching.  Ah, yeah.  Hey, oh.  I didn't even know Oprah was out there.  She could have had me for two grand.  Oh, man.  Yeah, Elo, what's wrong with you?  Exactly.  I can't save you a couple million dollars.  You know, and Jim is trying to fight the urge from having girls with fucking penises 
[01:31:00]  come to his house.  It's been a very tough road, Oprah.  Why, Jim?  Why?  I don't know.  I'm questioning everything.  Do-do-do, the Oprah music.  Yes.  You think we'd get the same amount of eyeballs on the Oprah channel?  Not at all.  If Elo got us instead of Lindsay Lohan?  No.  Of course not.  No, it was a pretty good interview, though.  I kind of enjoyed it as I was crashing.  But anyway, so Herbie the Love Bug, drive-in movie.  Went to the drive-in and then went to the shooting range they got out there. 
[01:31:30]  I love Vegas.  Full automatic weaponry.  God damn, is that a pisser.  And they just don't allow that on Long Island, huh?  At the ranges?  No, not full automatic.  Not as much.  Oh, there.  That was a fucking great gun.  Wait, what were we looking at?  Yeah, that thing was the pisser.  What was that?  A saw.  It's called a saw.  It's just fucking full automatic.  You just rent them?  Great.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  Can you rent guns on ranges on Long Island?  I don't even know.  But in Vegas, you can.  Vegas, you can.  In Vegas, if someone doesn't have a pistol license, you can still rent a pistol, go out  there shooting fucking pistol.  No kidding.  Yeah, full automatic.  Wow.  It's a pisser.  We did the thing where you got an instructor in there with you, goes over the weapons with  you and stuff like that.  And it gives you a lot of time, alone time.  I'm not in there with a bunch of riffraff.  Aren't you scared?  There's a picture of you with the saw. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  So you rented that for, what, a half hour?  Well, I rented a bunch of guns.  Now your fingerprints are all over it.  Now they do another crime.  Yeah, right?  Or they did the crime beforehand, and then they hand you the fucking saw.  That's a pretty good scenario for a little twist in a movie, right?  Yeah, that guy, I don't know.  We shot him up.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun going to the range, shooting some more exotic automatic weaponry.  It is a lot of fun. 
[01:33:00]  There's just something about shooting automatic.  Went to go see Penn and Teller.  Did that, too.  Saw their little magic show out there.  Yeah, it's just a lot of fucking fun.  What a fun show.  You get to talk to Penn afterwards?  He had family over.  Right.  So he had to go and leave right away after the show.  But I saw him for a few minutes.  I was able to talk to him.  We were texting beforehand, also.  Did you talk to Teller?  No, but he talks.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, he gets out there and talks.  Wait, he gets out there and talks on the show now? 
[01:33:30]  No, after the show.  He'll talk to people and stuff.  And yeah, it was a lot of fun, man.  What a great vacation.  And then when we weren't doing shit, we were getting cabanas by the fucking big pool complex  over there at MGM.  MGM, it's fantastic.  I miss the MGM.  We used to go out there every year for the show.  Yeah.  Oh, that's another thing.  We decided to go take the rental car, which was a Mustang convertible.  And I was taking it off-roading in the mountains, in the desert mountains by Hoover Dam. 
[01:34:00]  And what a pisser that was.  How long the ride was in Hoover Dam?  Three hours or so?  No, it's fucking like real close to Vegas.  It's right there.  It's right there.  It's less than an hour, I think.  Yeah.  Less than an hour.  How was it?  It's big.  We didn't stop.  We didn't do anything.  We stopped at the pull-off areas for the car.  And just checked it out a little bit.  Snap a few pics and then fucking go.  I can't imagine, like, what you'd do, like, and here's where they poured the cement.  And the concrete, it's still cooling. 
[01:34:30]  It's going to cool for another hundred years.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did they say that really?  Something like that.  Supposedly, the concrete's still cooling.  Why?  Yeah.  I don't know.  The concrete is a weird chemical thing that, like, stays hot for a long time.  I don't know exactly.  But they said it's going to be cooling for another...  Oh, that was a bad hundred years.  God.  What happened?  Those are the...  Wait, before you get to that...  Chocolate chips.  Hold on.  What's that?  Exactly.  Before you get to that, the Hoover Dam was...  Because nothing?  I've never been.  It's cool. 
[01:35:00]  It's very cool.  Is it huge?  To look at.  It's giant.  So why when you walk across it?  Can't you do the walk across?  We drove across it.  We drove across the top.  There's a road.  All right, okay.  You drive across and you see people walking and shit and snapping pictures.  But you could take pictures from fucking, you know, either side.  Okay.  And once you see it, like, I don't really...  I don't care to...  Is there a lot of water on the one side?  Oh, there seems to be a lot of water on one side.  Not so much on the other.  It's an interesting phenomenon. 
[01:35:30]  Well, what would happen if that thing fucking, dare I say, you know, blown up or something?  Well, I guess it would drain the beautiful Lake Mead.  Right.  Which is out there.  Took some pictures of that.  Is this a lake of beer?  Old, oldie time beer.  Lake Mead.  Oh, good.  Yeah, yeah.  That was cool.  And then driving the Mustang off-road was like, you got to really look and go, okay, I could... 
[01:36:00]  That looks like an oil pan ripper outer.  Well, I better go up on the edge a little bit.  And yeah, you really can't just tool around in that thing.  But yeah, it was kind of cool.  I hadn't been in the desert in a long time like that.  Kind of walking around.  Got out.  See any rattlesnakes?  No rattlesnakes, but saw some longhorn ram.  Really?  Yeah, those big fucking things that go...  And hit each other on the horns.  They're in Vegas?  I thought they were only in the mountains. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, they're in the fucking mountains.  No, they weren't walking down the strip, Jimmy.  I was in the mountains.  It was...  Oh.  Yeah.  Wait, you saw those?  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  Like the rams' rams?  Bighorn sheep.  No shit.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  They looked ridiculous.  We came around the corner on the dirt road.  I was going real slow, because like I said, I was off-roading in a fucking Ford Mustang.  And we came around the corner, and all of a sudden, you just saw them kind of run off a little bit. 
[01:37:00]  And then stopped and turned to look.  Like, oh, cool.  Fucking started snapping some pitches.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was our little nature excursion.  Very cool.  Which was fun.  Liked our little nature excursion.  You did a lot.  Yeah.  Usually, you just kind of hang out in your room and do a little gambling.  A little gambling.  Maybe a little dinner, but you got out there.  I did do a little gambling.  Well, that's another thing, too.  It's like dinner was interesting.  Because I'm used to going out to some fine restaurants. 
[01:37:30]  To get some fine dinners in.  But, you know, when the girl you're with just wants to go to In-N-Out Burger every night.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She likes that In-N-Out Burger.  She doesn't like the fine dining, though.  What are you going to do?  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Yeah, but you can get fine dining anywhere.  Well, that's true.  You can't get In-N-Out here.  Those goddamn In-N-Out burgers are pretty fucking good. 
[01:38:00]  You know what?  I saw one.  I've never had an In-N-Out Burger.  They're not West Coast.  I mean, sorry, East Coast.  No.  But no fine dining?  What?  The steak is tough on her braces?  It's not like she's dropping it on her legs.  She can't.  She's polio.  Polio.  The thing is, you know how lucky you are?  You have exactly the opposite problem.  Every guy wants to take his chick for an In-N-Out Burger.  They want steak.  Yes.  That's great.  I fucking should have let me spend $20 a night on food.  It could be worse. 
[01:38:30]  In-N-Out Burger is awesome.  It was really...  Really?  Yeah.  Nice.  You don't get them that often.  You know.  Yeah.  Did you ever go to the Wynn?  The food at the fucking Wynn?  I went to the fucking buffet there once.  Good, yeah.  Dude, it made me want to stay there.  I went during the day just for like whatever the buffet is.  It was amazing food there.  But I'm not a VIP, so I just would hate to stay there.  Yeah.  In your eyes I am, but...  In your eyes.  What about Vegas, though?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, I went to Vegas.  No, I mean the gambling...  I know, the gambling.  I did...  If you see, there was a lot of fucking money.  You were tweeting a lot of stacks.  You were doing well there.  See, you want to get what they call the chocolate chips.  What's that?  What's that?  So you start with the black.  Those are the hundreds.  Okay.  Then you move up to...  There's like purple, which are five hundreds.  Don't have any there.  Then the yellow, which are thousands. 
[01:39:30]  And then the chocolates, which are five thousands.  Jesus.  What are we looking at right there?  That's about 60 large.  60 large.  Which I promptly whittled down to.  Oh, no.  I was going for the big hundred Gs.  What if you got the hundred, though?  Then you would have to go for the two hundred?  Nah.  If I got the hundred, I had to fucking...  You would have walked?  I'd walk.  It was getting very early anyway in the morning. 
[01:40:00]  So, yeah.  Yeah.  That was a...  It was good.  I mean, man.  What a run.  You turned 60 into what?  Or you don't want to say?  About seven.  D?  No.  Seven.  No.  Lost 50.  52.  53.  It was a...  It was a hell of a descent.  Uh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you're hitting on 20?  What the fuck happened to you?  You got cocky, you think? 
[01:40:30]  I can't do no wrong.  Ah, hit me.  Hit me.  This ace is in this deck.  Just being an asshole.  I'm unstoppable.  While we're talking about this, can you talk about that woman who was, like, didn't like  the bets you were making?  Oh, God.  What was this about?  It's some fucking...  Ugh.  Sitting at the table.  There's a guy and his wife.  And then some just woman sitting there with the guy in the middle. 
[01:41:00]  You know?  I don't think she knew the couple.  And I've been playing with the guy at the table for a while.  Doing well.  And then it starts going into that little descent.  You know?  I'm losing some fucking leeway here.  And the fucking bitch next to me starts going,  Ugh.  That's just stupid.  Why are you...  Why are you even...  You know, you shouldn't...  You shouldn't bet that much.  You're fucking stupid.  You're stupid.  Why is she...  What?  Who was she? 
[01:41:30]  Just some fucking...  I'll tell you who she was.  She was right.  He lost $53,000.  You should have looked at your conscience.  Fuck her.  Oh, she was there for the big fall off?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So I'm just like...  Was she a hooker or something?  Just trying to...  No, she wasn't a hooker.  Please.  She was not even fucking close to a hooker.  She was a house frow.  Someone's fucking albatross.  Someone else's problem.  Were you annoyed?  Not fucking mine.  Yes!  Because I don't fucking have to sit there with this bitch wife fucking next to me. 
[01:42:00]  Did you tell her to shut up?  Oh, yeah.  And the fucking...  And the guys...  The guy that I had been playing with, his wife started chiming in.  Really?  With the fucking teaming up with the girl.  Like, like, oh, yeah, wow.  So did the guy give you the look like...  I don't need this.  Did the guy give you the look like, oh, I can't control her.  I'm sorry.  I said...  I go...  I told her, I go, why don't you shut up?  I go, I'm not fucking...  You're not my wife, thank God.  And I don't come here to have some bitch giving me advice on what I should or shouldn't be doing. 
[01:42:30]  Did you really say it like that?  Yes, exactly like that.  But every time you lost a big hand, was she giving you a little look like, say, I told you.  Yes.  I wanted...  It was like you were married again for a couple hours.  It was.  I wanted a fucking puncher in the face.  You were married.  Was she playing?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  She was, and I would have fucking told her.  Did she do well?  Scram.  She was playing fucking $5, maybe. 
[01:43:00]  That's what I would...  Wait, wait.  I don't even look if they're doing well.  They don't have those special rooms at the MGM?  No, the regular tables have like a $5,000 max bet, so I usually just sit down there.  You have to go higher than the $5,000 to get into the other rooms?  No.  No, they got like hundreds and stuff like that.  But I was doing well at the smaller tables, so I kind of stayed there.  Eric is saying, I bet that girl was a cooler.  Maybe.  You think they fucking slid someone in?  Maybe she was a cooler. 
[01:43:30]  She was alone.  She fucking sits there and just starts fucking giving me the what have you.  Because you were up 60.  You think you got the attention of the fucking eyes in the sky?  Maybe.  And they sent her...  Send her in to fucking change my head.  To fuck with my head.  You think that cooler shit is real?  Yes.  You really do?  Yeah.  You might have gotten a cooler put on you.  I might have gotten the cooler.  Because then you're like, oh, really?  Because then your attitude will be, well, really?  I'll show you.  And then you're going to push some more big bets.  Fucking bitch.  Did you just get played by the MGM? 
[01:44:00]  I think they got me.  I think they played me.  Do you think?  Fucking cooler bitch.  Because why else would she just be there by herself like that?  That's some cooler bitch.  Oh, man.  And she wasn't playing.  She didn't have much action on the table.  Should have fucking ended up in the trunk of my Mustang, digging some holes out in the desert.  You think you got a cooler put on you?  I think I did, now that you mention it.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, man.  You think so, shit?  Fuck yeah.  She worked her over with the bat.  Dump her in a hole.  Bury her alive. 
[01:44:30]  Wow, Eric is on it.  He's like, I bet that girl was a cooler.  Cooler.  I thought that only happened in the movies.  That's what I thought.  Yeah.  I think I was cooled.  Right.  That's going to fuck with your head, and you're definitely going to start.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to fucking get out of your game.  And you're definitely going to, like, try to show her, so you're going to push a couple  extra big bets through.  Yep.  That fucking bitch.  Holy fuck, it might have worked, too.  Oh, I think it did.  Damn her!  Do you think she gets a commission? 
[01:45:00]  Maybe.  Jeez.  Yeah.  No, that only happens in the movies.  Knock it off.  There's no coolness.  Knock it off.  Also, losing $60,000 also only happens in the movies.  Oh.  Well.  Yep.  Hey.  Are you having a realization right now that you might have had a cooler put on you?  Whatever happens, happens.  It's the cards.  The cards turn.  If you don't walk away at the right time, you just nailed it.  Just walk away. 
[01:45:30]  Just walk away.  A says, hi!  Yeah.  Sam Rothstein.  I want to get that woman on to debate me.  What is she so afraid of?  I did have a fucking blueberry muffin where the blueberries were evenly distributed in the  entire...  Nice.  Yeah.  Do you know how long this will take?  Yeah.  Tonight, taped live from the all-new sportsbook, we present the premiere showing of Aces High  with the Sasha Seminoff Orchestra.  I like that. 
[01:46:00]  And the Sam Rothstein Dancers.  The Sam Rothstein Dancers.  Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best football handicapper in America.  Oh.  A man who will take you inside the real Las Vegas that no one has ever done before.  And they show these cheesy videos of someone slicing up a piece of meat.  A new entertainment director of the Andrews Hotel Casino, Mr. Sam Rothstein.  Sam.  Hey.  How you doing?  Any other...  I saw your tweets.  You weren't happy with the dealers.  No. 
[01:46:30]  I fell on some good dealers.  They were pretty good.  But then the bad ones, oh boy, they're just pulling their typical shenanigans, you know.  Oh boy, I got a 20.  Oh look, they got a 21.  Oh, I got 19.  Oh, they got fucking a 6 showing.  They turn a 4 and a 10.  You should have known.  I know you're a big card counter.  Oh yeah, I like counting those cards.  There's one.  There's another one.  That's how I count.  Don't they have 80 decks now?  It's fucking auto-shuffling. 
[01:47:00]  You don't even see the cards until they're out in front of you.  You don't even know how many cards are going to shoot anymore.  I was doing pretty good on single deck.  Yeah.  I was doing that.  It kind of sucks they got to shuffle after every time and shit.  But it was pretty good.  You know what we learned about card counting through Ben Mesrick?  They don't mind you counting cards because they know most people just can't do it properly.  So they know they're actually making a lot more money off the card counters because they're cocky because they read a book. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I could do that.  Right.  So they don't even give a fuck.  Plus one.  Plus two.  Minus two.  Plus one.  Where was I?  I actually keep a notebook with a pen and I just go, queen one, king one, two, one.  How long would you last on a table?  I'm just making a little notation of every card that comes by.  That's a good one.  You can ask everyone to wait while you finish writing.  Hold on, slow down.  You had a seven and a five.  What did you have?  Obviously, if you pull out a notepad, that's it. 
[01:48:00]  But what if you had a pen and you're just writing it on your hand?  On your hand.  How long would you last?  Would you last a hand?  Or you're counting on your fingers.  One, two, three.  And you're just holding them up.  All right, go!  And then you pull back a couple of fingers.  Or you just take photos of everyone, like, you know, with their hands.  Yeah, because they love the cameras out.  I've noticed lately you've been able to take a few pictures from the table and tweet it.  What's that about?  Because as soon as you pull out a camera, they yell at you to leave the table.  Sometimes they do. 
[01:48:30]  Other times, you could just turn your chair away a little and you make it look like you're texting.  And then you go, click, snap a picture of the table.  That's always brave.  I try to do that shit, but I'm like, they're odd to me.  They'll just tell you, knock it off.  They won't throw you out right away.  No.  Not in this day and age.  Everyone's got one.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  I just said, not in this day and age.  What a fucking old man I am.  How long were you last at the table?  I want to go with this bit for a little while.  Have you just sat down with a GoPro camera on your fucking forehead?  On your head!  Hello. 
[01:49:00]  How you doing?  Stream!  Stream cards, man!  What?  I just GoPro everything.  What?  This is a problem?  GoPro in my life here.  What are you doing?  I'm entitled.  Open his head.  Open the door with his GoPro.  Is that it for Vegas?  Yeah, that was about it.  Sounded like you had a good week.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun, definitely.  A lot of activities?  Yes.

[01:49:30]  The lazy river just flows around.  A little pool complex.  There's not many things better than a lazy river.  Oh, you've got a lot of fun.  A hard-working river.  Oh, Chip.  That was Chip.  That was...  Yeah.  You ever do the...  It's not that lazy.  The lazy river at Atlantis?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Where it gets fucking pretty wild around some of those turns and shit?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  The thing is, trying to keep from getting hit with the jets of freezing cold water that they 
[01:50:00]  pump in there.  Yeah.  Although it was about...  It was about 102 to 108 the whole time out there.  It's hot out there in the desert.  But it's that dry heat.  It doesn't matter.  It's an oven.  It's a fucking oven.  Okay.  The dry heat, when you open an oven and the heat hits you, that's what it feels like.  We walked around when I was out there and it was literally...  The breeze made it worse. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It was hot air being blown up.  God was throwing hot air at your face.  It was horrendous.  Yeah.  The worst of the week, Countdown.  On the O.P. Anthony channel.

The worst of the week countdown.  No!  Continues.  It's the worst of the week countdown with me, Sam Roberts, from, you know, the show that we're talking about.  Opie and Anthony.  And we've got a lot still to get to.  Roland, this week, our talent booker, he thought he lost his job. 
[01:55:00]  And he panicked, and we just watched him panic for a while.  It's very funny.  I'll explain it to you more when we get to it.  First, I want to play for you an interview we did with a guy who's just known as the giant scrotum guy.  That's not that great.  You always want to have a bigger penis.  I don't think anybody prays for elephantitis of the testicles.  William Warren, Jr.  He tells us all about it.  Mr. Massive Scrotum on the worst of the week countdown. 
[01:55:30]  Number two.  Number two.  Wow.  How did you, like, you go into the bank, if your scrotum was that big, how do you sit in the car?  Are you sitting on them, or were you able to manipulate it so it's kind of in front of you and you're not crunching your own balls?  I couldn't ride in the car for a couple of years, basically.  After I did the Howard Stern Show in September of 2011, shortly after that, I mean, I just couldn't get in the car. 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  I had to sit in some sort of a van whereby I had enough leg room to put down a couple of crates in front of me, milk crates.  Well, it started out with one milk crate before the testicle sack grew to whereby I needed two milk crates.  But a milk crate and a giant pillow.  And I lifted each side of the hooded sweat jacket.  I used that to lift up my testicles so that I could place the rest of the testicle sack on the crate and the giant pillow. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, my God.  What a chore.  Then I progressed to two crates, you know, so I used to have to have a little granny cart or luggage cart to go wherever I went or an assistant.  You know, to take all this stuff around.  How long did your assistants last?  Was that a tough job to fill?  One of them is still with me.  Monique's out in the hallway. 
[01:57:00]  But it is tough.  It is tough, you know.  You know, you're dealing with the genitals.  You're dealing with that area that people, I guess, only tolerate wanting to deal with somebody for so long.  And I kept growing.  I didn't stop growing down there.  Yeah, let's start from the beginning, though.  Like, how did it all begin?  Yeah.  Did you have normal?  A lot of people are not aware of the lymph nodes that they have in their body.  And to this day, I don't even know where all of my lymph nodes are.  I mean, you know. 
[01:57:30]  And at the time in 2008 in May.  Wait, were you normal before 2008?  Normal meaning just a normal looking?  At the time in 2008 when this happened.  Yeah.  Okay.  Up until that time, I may not have been proud of my penis, but I wasn't embarrassed or ashamed about it either.  But I was kind of proud of my kind of oversized testicle sack that I had.  And when they were loose, they straddled apart.  And, you know, at least I had that kind of, you know, something.  You had a big bang.  I felt that my masculinity felt very proud as a result of at least that much. 
[01:58:00]  What about the shaft back then?  How was the shaft?  But unfortunately, because of those loosey-goosey rather large testicles spreading apart there,  when I hopped up as if as though I was coming out of a very bad dream or a nightmare, which I wasn't, but as if as though I was,  when I hopped up onto the side of the bed so quickly as I did, my right leg slammed as hard as it could have slammed onto my right testicle. 
[01:58:30]  And the pain was only about a dozen seconds, but it was so excruciating that, and I'm remembering this vivid like it was not just yesterday, but like it was last night.  I pictured in my mind, guys, a tractor-trailer wheel, a tractor-trailer tire rolling off of my testicle. 
[01:59:00]  That's, I mean, literally, that's what popped into my mind.  And I felt like, you know what?  I dodged a bullet.  But then the nighttime comes of this day, and I felt a sensational carpet-burning sensation that wouldn't go away.  I fell asleep.  Next morning, morning number two now, somehow, for some reason, from the last time I got up to use the restroom,  and when I woke up for the morning on day number two, I had a testicle sack when I awoke, when I wakened, about the size of a cantaloupe or like a honeydew melon. 
[01:59:30]  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  That fast.  And it's...  Did you break the testicle and it filled with fluid?  Yes.  Well, exactly.  Oh, my God.  And not fluid in the sense whereby you could stick a needle in there and drain it out, like a balloon, water in a balloon.  It was fluid more in the sense of like a juicy Thanksgiving turkey. 
[02:00:00]  So it's all mixed in there.  Like a brain almost.  Yeah.  In the meat of it.  Exactly.  Oh, man.  Now, why did you immediately seek medical attention?  Mm-hmm.  You did?  Oh, of course.  And what...  They'd never seen anything like it.  They didn't know what to do for me.  They put me on some kind of antibiotic in case if I had some kind of an infection down there as a result of... 
[02:00:30]  And I explained to the triage nurse and the doctor as to what happened, but they put me on antibiotics and nothing was happening.  Nothing was happening to correct the situation.  But I've learned from in the past, you know, you've got to follow the directions of taking antibiotics and go through that two-week cycle or whatever the cycle is to complete.  Because a lot of times, you know, you don't see results until towards the end of the cycle.  So in a couple of weeks, I completed the cycle and my testicles were not getting any smaller. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, man.  I raced, rushed back to that emergency room as quickly as I could.  And I said, well, you know what?  And I've noticed some urine in my...  I've noticed some blood in my urine.  Oh, man.  So they could take me a little bit more seriously.  Right, right.  There you go.  But you didn't notice any blood.  Well, I don't know if I want to go on record.  All right.  But I will say this, you know, they took me more seriously and they kept me in the hospital overnight.  They said, look, you're in luck because there's going to be the doctor on the halls of the hospital tomorrow doing his rounds that can look into your problem for you. 
[02:01:30]  So all you just have to do is just stay one night.  I'd never been in the hospital except for when I was like three years old or whatever.  But in my memory from when I was four years old forward, I'd never been in the hospital.  So this is like, oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  Whatever.  You know, I want this to go away.  So I'm in the hospital Sunday night, Monday, Monday night. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, man.  No doctor.  Tuesday, Wednesday.  Finally, at four o'clock in the afternoon on Thursday.  But I was about going out of my mind.  Wait a minute.  You know, how come I'm not being attended to here?  Why am I lying in this hospital bed?  Doctor comes in, examines me, says, well, it looks like your blood pressure is under.  It turns out they were more concerned about my blood pressure when I had gone into the  hospital emergency room on Sunday than the testicle sack.  And they kind of tricked me. 
[02:02:30]  I can't think of the right word I really want to say.  But, you know, but they tricked me into staying because, you know, I'm not going to stay in  the hospital for high blood pressure.  You know, so they got me to agree to stay.  And I saw the doctor Thursday afternoon.  I said, well, he said, you're going to be good to go.  I said, good to go.  I said, yeah, what about my balls?  Come on.  Exactly.  So he points out.  He says, well, what?  I said, well, look.  He points out the window to a building down the street, across the street, you know, 
[02:03:00]  across and down the street, which is the outpatient surgery center for UMC Hospital in Las Vegas.  He says, you've got to go over there.  You've got to go over there.  I don't know anything about this.  I can't treat you.  Oh, boy.  You can't treat me.  I said, I was, you know.  So I go over to this outpatient surgery center.  Did you have insurance, by the way?  No.  I go to the outpatient surgery center, and they told me. 
[02:03:30]  At this time, that really wasn't an issue.  Clark County in Nevada, if you're not on Medicaid, which I wasn't at that moment, I got a Clark County  health card, which could pay for all of my medical problems then at that time.  So they weren't trying to screw you because they wouldn't get paid.  Not at that moment.  Okay.  Not at that moment.  But when I went over there with my giant honeydew melon-sized testicle sack, the outpatient  surgery center said, okay, well, yeah, we can schedule an appointment for you to come 
[02:04:00]  in and see a surgeon in three months.  Oh, man.  So a lot of people wonder, why did it take all this time?  Why did you do anything?  Why didn't I do anything?  The system is set up in such a manner to whereby, you know, if you're dying, you'll be dead before  you can get a lot of things taken care of because you've got to wait your turn.  And you've got to, and eventually insurance and how they're going to be paid, you know,  the players involved that you need to be of assistance to help you.  And, you know, all of that eventually comes into play and can hold up the process. 
[02:04:30]  Three months.  Wow.  And so they just kept...  Well, that eventually turned into five years.  They just kept growing.  May 23rd, 2008.  I had my surgery on April 8th, Monday, April 8th, 2013.  Wait, so what happened?  They say three months.  In California.  So what's going on for that three months?  And then what happens when the surgery date comes?  The original one that you said three months.  No, no, that was just to be looked at, to be examined by a surgeon over at this outpatient 
[02:05:00]  surgery center.  During those three months, I'm basically sitting on my hands.  I mean, I'm out there actually still trying to go out and make a living.  I wasn't on Social Security at the time.  What kind of work are you doing?  Well, let's see, at that time, oh, okay, let's see, 2008.  At that time, I was hunting around, scouting locations to put ATM cash machines, which I  loved doing that. 
[02:05:30]  And so I kept on running around doing that.  So you're waiting three months.  You go to meet the surgeon, the original one.  What does he say to you when you walk in and you show him these giant testicles?  Had they grown by then?  He's grown more, but slowly.  The testicles originally, as like towards the end, originally grew only a little bit  every few months.  It got to a point after a couple of, after about a year and a half or so, maybe two years, 
[02:06:00]  it got to a point that for about nine months, every fifth or sixth day, if it didn't happen  on the fifth day, I knew, like clockwork, my brain was going to occur, was going to make  my attack occur on the sixth day.  I would get very, very, very cold.  I would start feeling, I was like shivering.  I would get cold shivers, which immediately led to my shaking like a person on epilepsy. 
[02:06:30]  Well, not epilepsy entirely, but I would start getting...  Tremors?  Yeah, yeah.  I started shaking like a leaf all over the place.  My muscles, my body would tense up and I would just shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.  For about 45 minutes was like the quickest time, but usually closer to two hours.  Wow.  That episode would happen every fifth or sixth day. 
[02:07:00]  And then afterwards is when I felt it.  I knew, I just always somehow knew that my ball sack was a little larger.  Oh my God.  What was that shake?  Was it something with your pituitary gland or what is it that made it grow?  That was obviously your body pushing fluid into it or doing something, right?  And I was wreaking havoc on my, on something, something in my brain was, was being affected by what was going on in my testicle sack. 
[02:07:30]  You see.  Tell me about it.  It happens.  You know, at that time, you know, when I was lifting up my testicle sack to plop it basically into the toilet bowl whenever I would have to urinate.  And if it, and if the backside of it rested in a certain place, uh, along the side of the, inside of that testicle bowl, uh, uh, uh, uh, toilet bowl.  It was a testicle bowl at that point, right? 
[02:08:00]  Wow.  Exactly.  Oh man.  You know, uh, I would actually start to feel lightheaded, you know, or like I was going to have some kind of, uh, you know, uh, I became lightheaded.  My heart would, uh, flutter.  So, so different parts of the body were communicating in a weird way with each other as a result of this.  So you meet this surgeon three months in and what does he say to you that he thinks it is?  What does he say to come back in a month or what? 
[02:08:30]  There's nothing I can do for you.  That's what the first surgeon says?  He says, I've never seen this sort of thing before.  Uh, he orders all kinds of tests.  So by the time I go and I get all these various tests done and he says, um, you've got to go back to your primary care physician, you know, you know, because I don't know what I can do for you.  Uh, I, I've never treated anything like this before.  Uh, so he says, uh, you know, you, you probably have something, uh, like they have over in, uh, you know, in the continent of Africa. 
[02:09:00]  Uh, you know, like, uh, uh, uh, elephantitis, you know, we, we don't know anything about how to treat that.  Yeah.  You know, so what eventually happened was, um, I got a referral, scientific name for that.  I got a referral from the hospital, uh, to go see Dr. Malagata Kassahan.  And Dr. Kassahan turns out he was, uh, and supposed to be still the absolute number one top urological surgeon in the entire state of Nevada. 
[02:09:30]  Uh, he says, my friend, my friend, nobody will touch you.  Nobody will want to do anything with you, but me.  Oh.  And he said, and the best that I can do for you is to do a clear cut.  Cut it all off.  What? 
[02:10:00]  And you'll have to urinate through a tube for the rest of your life.  Take your dick too?  Yes, everything.  Wow.  So, my mind was like, oh, fuck.  There's got to be another way.  Yeah.  This is not a cure.  Jesus.  That, that, that, that, um, uh, this is not a cure for me.  What was he saying it was?  He had to be giving you some kind of a diagnosis as to what was causing it.  Um, scrotal edema. 
[02:10:30]  Um, a massive scrotal edema, which basically, you know, an edema.  It's caused, it's like a massive growth, uh, which is brought on by fluids and, and, and, and, and whatnot.  Uh, enlargement of the, of your, of body mass tissue.  And, uh, so basically, scrotal edema.  What they wanted to do, uh, when what they decided to do was to put me in the hospital, uh, at UMC.  He says, um, let's figure out, uh, let's try to see if we can do something for you. 
[02:11:00]  Uh, and so basically what they did was a, what they call a left inguinal hernia operation on me.  Uh, and that was after my being in the hospital for five weeks and multiple teams of doctors coming in to, uh, examine me and, and look at me as if it was on some kind of a test case or, or experiment or something.  I mean, it was unbelievable.  So in the fifth week out of eight weeks total in the hospital, I have this surgery. 
[02:11:30]  After eight weeks, I am crying as I'm leaving the hospital because I had a bigger testicle sack after eight weeks than when I went in there.  Oh man, I didn't do anything.  Yeah.  How big was it at this point now?  Um, I don't know, but it wasn't long, too long after I was on the Howard Stern show.  And they had an actual scale, digital scale there for me to weigh the actual testicle sack on.  And it measured up to, it went up to, the weight was 145 pounds. 
[02:12:00]  Wow.  At that point.  God, gosh.  And the skin could stretch that much?  Apparently so.  Apparently so is right.  I know.  I'm amazed by that.  You would think something.  You know, it's, it's like a kid being amazed by how your penis can go like this to like that when you're fully erect.  It's like, where does all that, how does all that come about from that?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  The worst of the week countdown on the Opie and Anthony Channel.

Of course, if you missed any of it, you can listen to a replay or listen to a live show or probably look at this on demand.  In the meantime, don't forget, I've been Sam Roberts.  It's Sunday, 4 p.m. Eastern, is the Sam Roberts Show, where I'll be highlighting a lot of the stuff I got done when I was in Los Angeles last week.  A lot of stuff from WWE's SummerSlam event, and a whole lot more. 
[02:17:30]  So check it out on this channel, the Opie and Anthony channel, Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern.  It's going to be a hoot.  We leave you with the number one bit of the week.  And it's a long one, so strap in.  It's completely worth it.  It's rolling.  Roland, he comes in, see, Sirius XM is doing this big Metallica concert, right?  They're having Metallica play at the Apollo Theater here in New York.  It's this little intimate theater.  It's like 3,000 seats, and Metallica's going to be there.  It's a pretty big deal.  And they're also, alongside with this, launching a Metallica channel. 
[02:18:00]  Now, there was kind of rumblings of this inside the building, but it wasn't announced until Thursday, I believe it was.  Roland didn't realize it had been announced.  So he came in thinking that Opie and Anthony had taken confidential information that he had given them and exposed it to the world.  And we watched him panic for a while, because it's hilarious.  Roland panics over losing his job, because he made it up in his head. 
[02:18:30]  Number one on the campaign.  Number one.  By the way, oh, see, seeing him live.  Are we going to get to go to the big fucking gig that's coming up at the Apollo?  I would hope so.  I'm sure we will.  I'm sure we will.  I want to see that fucking thing.  Can we talk about what gig?  What are you allowed to announce, Dolly?  I saw it somewhere.  Metallica.  Metallica at the Apollo.  What is that about? 
[02:19:00]  Metallica at the Apollo Theater.  Are you serious?  I know.  I want to go.  When is that going down?  In September.  Oh, we're so there.  We better be.  Of course we're there.  But that'd be.  I think so.  I don't think they would.  Now that we're company guys, we're going to be there.  Where's your crown king?  Yeah.  Nah.  Very exciting.  I'm calling it.  It's Metallica Day.  No.  Yeah, we really should.  With the big announcement.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:19:30]  What?  No, no.  No.  There was a big...  No, no, no, no, no.  There was no announcement.  There was no announcement.  Forget the...  Sad but true.  Forget that last thing.  There was no announcement.  Big announcement.  No.  I heard from a very reliable source.  I don't know what source you could have heard that from.  Roland.  No.  No.  Why would you say his name?  What?  You did.  Roland does not want you talking about Metallica playing the Apollo.  Stop saying that. 
[02:20:00]  Why?  No, he doesn't want...  I don't know.  What?  What?  Has he been in Communicate?  Yeah, he's been texting.  He's been texting?  Why is he panicking?  Why is he panicking?  Metallica's playing the Apollo.  Yeah.  When is it?  September?  September.  September, yeah.  21st.  Fuck it.  Someone's got to announce this shit.  Yeah, but...  Is there a big announcement that was supposed to happen today?  I believe at 10 a.m.  Where?  Probably one of the rock channels.  I don't know.  Why would they give us that?  Why wouldn't they give us that scoop?  So...  I don't know.  Because there's probably more Metallica fans listening to where they play Metallica. 
[02:20:30]  What's going to be announced at 10 a.m.?  We have more fans listening here than they do on fucking other stations.  And there's a lot of Metallica fans.  A bevy, I might say.  Holy fuck.  Heavy metal talk.  Well, it's the show going down.  Roland wasn't running around telling everybody.  Yeah.  Maybe we all know.  Is he panicking?  Roland is panicking.  Roland is in full panic mode.  Why?  He's beyond panicking.  Full panic mode. 
[02:21:00]  Why?  Because...  We announced Metallica's playing the Apollo during our first break.  Yeah.  And now we've turned this into Metallica Day.  What's wrong with that?  Roland says it's still a rumor.  What?  Who cares that at 10 o'clock they're making the official announcement when we can make it now?  It's not the rumor.  And I know a little bit about radio.  7.30, a lot of people are listening to their radio.  Absolutely.  So this is the perfect time to do an announcement.  To snatch it.  Yeah.  10 o'clock, everyone's at work.  No one's hearing the big announcement.  No one gives it turkey.  7.30 is when you make the big announcements. 
[02:21:30]  Metallica, Apollo Theater, what day?  Well, it's September 21st.  September 21st.  Cool.  I can't wait.  Me neither.  I better get tickets.  Yeah, I hope we get tickets to see it.  Front row.  Yes, we better.  We saw that Bruce thing there.  We saw Paul McCartney there.  That's right.  That was pretty amazing.  And to see Metallica at the Apollo would be fucking cool as shit.  Metallica to rock the Apollo Theater.  I think this was private information.  What?  I think it was private information. 
[02:22:00]  Until Roland told everybody.  Roland's got his ear to the ground, brother.  He knows shit.  And I appreciate that he fucking passes that shit on to us.  How long is the delay before Roland hears this and starts texting and losing his mind?  I don't know.  Why is he losing his mind?  He has to be.  This is what we do.  He is in full panic.  We blow up people's spots.  He was texting everybody, requesting certain statements be removed from replays.  Now, why would you remove it from the broadcast? 
[02:22:30]  If this announcement is supposed to be at 10 a.m.?  Right.  Why take it out of the replay, then?  Because it'll already be announced.  Right.  So why?  I don't understand that part of it.  He doesn't want any responsibility.  And I'm sorry.  I also don't understand why he's freaking out.  Yeah.  What has he written yet?  Who's he writing?  I asked him if it was bad if they say it again, since they already did.  Right.  And he said, yes.  Super bad.  Why?  Super bad?  Whoa.  And then what did you write?  I'll take the bad movie.  Well, super bad. 
[02:23:00]  He said, the rumor is the Apollo.  The venue can change.  I said, so it's only a rumor so far?  Not reported?  Right.  And he said, yes.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And then what?  Well, the rumor is the Apollo theater.  My mistake, then.  Marlon.  And then what happened?  Who'd you hear the rumor from?  Huh?  Roland.  Yeah, we shouldn't do it anymore to cover us.  Huh?  What happened?  Oh, we got to cover our asses?  Are we covering asses here?  We now have to cover our asses.  I think he's in route because my last message is not showing up.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's in the front car of the train going, can you go faster, please?  Faster, push it, push it, push it.  I got to go faster.  Could you go faster, please?  I have a text from Roland earlier.  They were saying, they haven't signed.  Tell Jimmy in his ear to stop.  Tell him in his ear.  Like in the middle of the break.  Oh, my God.  Eric, did you imagine that?  No, I did not.  Come on, Jimmy.  Please.  No, shut up.  Jimmy.  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  And then, can you cut that out of the replay, please? 
[02:24:00]  Hello?  Cut that out of the replay.  Oh, my God.  He is freaking out.  He told me, he said, I told Eric to cut that out of the replay.  I said, do you think we should?  He said, yes.  God, yes.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's going to come in here.  We got to lock the door.  Like a fucking monster.  No, I think it'll be the exact opposite.  I think he'll come in defeated and sad.  Do you think he'll cry?  No.  But he'll be like, oh, my God.  He's going to go straight to the boss's office.  No, he wrote something.  He wrote it.  What he wrote was pretty good.  Metallica show hasn't been announced. 
[02:24:30]  Please, please don't say it again.  Please, please.  I might get murder now.  Telling, telling.  Dang, that's why yesterday I said it's secret.  He wrote you.  Yeah.  Oh, I forgot this part, too.  Oh.  It was after where he said, tell if Jimena's here to stop.  And he goes, he wrote in big letters, secret.  And then it says, Jesus, why?  He only told you yesterday?  Poor guy is going to fucking lose his mind. 
[02:25:00]  We got to lock the door.  We have to.  He's freaking out right now.  He's very scary.  We should not be talking about this.  Apollo Theater, Metallica, September 21st.  Oh, no.  I think that's correct, but I wish you wouldn't bring it up anymore.  You could murder Roland by saying that.  And knowing how the company works, I'm sure there will be about ten seats for actual fans.  Depending on celebrity involvement.  I think there will be ten spots for the fans, and the rest of the Apollo Theater will be filled with celebrities. 
[02:25:30]  With who's who.  Holy fuck.  Like Tom Hanks.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Do you think they'll hold back a pair of tickets to Lotto to the employees?  Oh, maybe bring a stripper or a tranny?  Well, and I...  Huh.  This is exciting news.  It really is.  I can't wait.  It's not news.  No?  Ten o'clock, it'll be official?  It's a secret.  Until ten.  Is it a secret or a rumor until ten?  Some people can't keep secrets, can they? 
[02:26:00]  Who are you talking about?  I don't think it's a secret anymore.  So, I guess...  Lose lip sync ships?  It's a rumor, I guess, officially, right?  Well, you have announced it as fact that you guys are a trusted source of information.  Oh, no.  This is happening.  Lose lip sync ships.  This is happening, and it'll be official at ten o'clock.  According to Roland, it's still a rumor.  How could it be a rumor, like, this close to ten?  No one's signed...  But they're not up at this hour, still signing contracts.  The itch is dry.  Oh, please.  This is going down. 
[02:26:30]  No, no.  Don't say anything.  Why?  No, don't say anything.  Fuck, man.  It's all good, right?  Poor Roland.  It's not all good.  Oh, man.  He's got to be en route.  He's got to be.  Could you go a little faster, please?  Please.  You gotta go faster.  Could we not stop at 59th Street?  According to some text messages, this could indeed be the last Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, no.  Because you guys chose to make that announcement.  Wow.  Is that from...  Who's that from?  I mean, based on the information we've gotten, there could be murders. 
[02:27:00]  Murder.  Because of...  I love that one.  Why?  Because of this announcement that you guys chose to make.  And I love the other one.  Was it Jesus Why?  Yeah, Jesus Why.  Jesus Why.  Can you imagine living that tortured life?  That's what you say when you're given a terminal diagnosis.  That's what the girl said after her fucking foot got cut off by that road cam.  That's what you say when you realize you've lost a foot.  Not when you announce a Metallica show at the Apollo Theater. 
[02:27:30]  How cool is that?  I can't wait to fucking see that, man.  That is cool.  That's going to be great.  We hope we get tickets.  We're definitely going, right?  You guys have so much trouble.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Wow.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  After all the trouble.  It would be great.  After all the trouble, you guys are going to get in for announcing this?  I don't see you guys getting tickets.  What?  No?  No, I don't see it happening.  Come on.  I hope you guys don't get suspended for like a week and two days.  Oh.  Oh.  I wonder if, uh, look out. 
[02:28:00]  I hope some of us don't get suspended for one day longer.  Uh-oh.  Well, you know what?  We're hearing from the bosses and we might just get suspended.  Nah, we'll be here tomorrow.  Don't worry.  Yeah, don't worry.  Everything's good.  Yeah.  Of course.  I got a straight fucking idea.  Oh, yeah?  Can you mute the mics?  All right, they're muted.  Yeah?  That's actually stole some fucking tickets.  I'll pretend I broke into the boss's office. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  I'll just come back.  It made sense at the time.  No, but I'll come in and I'll go like, what the fuck?  I broke into the boss's office.  And you guys go, chip off.  Although I like that Roland is now playing up that in the reality thing.  The bosses don't want us announcing this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just heard back from him.  Okay.  Okay.  What did he say?  I said they're talking about it again.  He said, why?  I'm in the subway.  Oh, no.  Well, the why is because they're very excited. 
[02:29:00]  They're very excited.  They're big Metallica fans.  And they couldn't help themselves.  Let him know.  Very excited.  They were asked, how did they get this information?  And they announced on the air that Roland did indeed.  They said you told them.  Oh, Jesus.  Roland Campos presents.  Oh, poor Roland.  Let's go.  God help me.  No, don't say that.  Don't tell him that while he's in the subway.  Wait till he's away from the train.  Oh, you're going to jump on the tracks.  He's writing back.  I already sent it.  He's writing back?  Yeah.  Oh, no. 
[02:29:30]  I said they're very excited.  They said you told them.  Oh, no.  I texted, Opie needs 12 tickets.  He's texting.  He said, I told Jimmy it's a secret.  Great.  Secret.  He's having a terrible morning.  Anthony is the one who said it.  Exactly.  I didn't even.  It's not for air.  It's not for air.  I'm telling him I think it's okay.  He's having a lousy morning.  No, no, no.  Like that.  Just write back.  Oops.  Oops.  Right back. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are you going to do?  Whatever.  The guys say it's one of those things.  Yeah.  Shit happens.  Shit happens.  Yeah.  You know the guys.  Boys will be boys.  Yeah.  I think he's.  Ladies and gentlemen,  it's been an emergency on the subway line.  Now we're going to need you to get off  and we will supply bus transportation.  A gentleman has thrown himself in front of the subway car.  He's fine, but the train is broken. 
[02:30:30]  Is he riding back?  No, he's back underground.  Oh, no.  Feel fast, Tiffany.  Please skip this.  He probably stopped at a station that has,  you know, cell service.  Oh, so he can listen.  Oh, he's typing right now  and he sees like no service.  He's panicking.  The delay is crazy long.  Right.  So he might actually hear the entire break.  There's going to be a,  like when at AAF,  when the news guy popped out  and caught you guys in the elevator. 
[02:31:00]  Yes.  The news guy's going to pop out and say,  how do you feel?  Your talent booker threw himself in front of a train  because you announced a concert.  We go about,  look,  we apologize to Roland and his family.  And then Opie will go,  I didn't even know the conductor was a fan.  That stupid laugh afterwards.  Oh, God.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  What, what, what?  I don't know.  What, what?  Yeah.  I mean,  Roland,  he's got to relax.  Man, man.  You sold him out. 
[02:31:30]  The Apollo.  That's a,  man.  That's a secret.  A secret is the word.  Because to see  fucking Paul McCartney there  was amazing.  Springsteen.  Even Bruce,  like,  and I'm not a Bruce fan,  but to see him there,  the energy that,  somehow it just energizes the performers.  Now,  to see Metallica  at the Apollo Theater.  Oh, I can't wait.  On September 21st  will be amazing.  Why do you keep bringing it out?  What?  It's a secret.  What are they going to open to?  I wonder. 
[02:32:00]  That big a secret.  But I don't close with that.  Ride lightning.  But at this point  it can't be a secret,  so we might as well  keep talking about it.  Yeah, what are they?  We said it, we said it.  Yeah, we said it.  Fuck it.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do, man?  I'll just be...  Jim's nonchalant shrug.  After we said it,  we said it.  Yeah,  that is what it is, right?  I'm going to tell Roland,  sorry,  I guess it's  sad but true  Nice.  That they'll be  playing there, Roland.  Sorry,  Yeah, looks like the Sandman entered. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Shit, they might need an opener.  Fuck yeah, maybe I will.  Sick fucking puppies, man.  That'd be cool.  Everything sounds like...  Horrible guitar sound.  You don't think they would get cheered in front of the town?  Oh my god.  You think people would want Metallica on as soon as possible? 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  And by the way, I know you guys may not have enjoyed We're Cutting the Cheese.  Oh god.  But somebody's manager can't stop singing it.  Oh no, really?  Somebody's manager has been standing in front of the TV and singing it while his wife is trying to watch TV.  Jonathan is nuts.  He is nuts.  And apparently even created his own opera version.  That's what I've heard.  Yeah.  Do we have it?  No.  That's crazy. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, but it's not good.  Text message.  Oh no.  Roland.  What's he saying?  How's Roland doing?  Where is he?  What is he saying?  Almost here?  I said, I said, I think it's okay.  But hey, what are you going to do?  You know them.  And he said, yeah, I thought Jimmy would.  He loves them.  I don't know what that means.  Yeah.  He really thinks I blew it.  So he's accepting it.  They're all very excited.  Roland thinks that I blew it.  Because he trusted me and I never would have blabbed it. 
[02:34:00]  You didn't blab it.  Should we pump it up and say that Scott Greenstein's waiting outside the studio to talk to us?  Well, we just said, no, Scott's been in communication.  Like, Scott's pissed.  Pump it up.  Just let him know management doesn't seem happy.  Should we pump it up?  Yeah, management's not happy.  Should we ask him, did you clear this with Scott?  Because he's been...  He said, kill me.  He's so bummed.  Say Scott wants to talk to us during the next parade.  He does not handle work-related pressure well at all.  At all.  He handles it.  Fucking Major Hassan handled it better in Fort Hood. 
[02:34:30]  Fucking Roland handles it.  Oh, my God.  Poor guy.  See what he says to that.  Hey, yo.  Hey, yo.  My child, I go.  It was delivered, so we'll see.  All right, we'll see what he says.  Oh.  Hate.  I'm your hate.  God, I can't wait to see it.  I'm your hate when you won't lose.  Pay.  Pay the price.  Pay for nothing.  You think they're going to play the hits?  They better play the fucking hits. 
[02:35:00]  Well, they're promoting their movies, so they don't even have a lot of new songs, I mean,  because they're promoting a film.  No, they don't have, yeah.  It's just insensitive of you guys to get further on.  Yeah.  Even for the people just tuning in now, you're still making the announcement based on exclusive  information given solely to you guys.  Yeah.  By Roland.  Roland, as we discussed.  Well, what are you going to do?  Roland gave you the facts, huh?  I'm glad.  I'm glad.  Because then you could come in and make the announcement. 
[02:35:30]  You could come in and say it and be all excited about it.  People are excited.  What's this fucking 7.30, fucking 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, noon?  Who cares?  And now you have a one-up on everyone requesting tickets.  Exactly.  You knew before everyone.  We say right away, we need tickets to this amazing event.  Metallica, the Apollo.  Yeah, I can't wait for the Apollo Theater show.  It'd be great.  Those shows are so cool.  I got a lot of, da-da-da-da-da.  We're the four horsemen.  I hope we get the guys in. 
[02:36:00]  I mean, they're...  Now we won't.  No, now we can't.  Is he running back?  No.  Oh.  I don't know where he is.  His phone is going right to voicemail now.  It's just laying on the third rail.  Yeah.  Fizzling.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Wait, wait, wait.  I know, I'm not saying anything, but...  What?  That's great. 
[02:36:30]  Come on.  Ah, well.  We'll give away the punchline.  I'm mad at you.  Roland.  Oh, boy.  It's just not going to be good for Roland.  No.  It's not confirmed, though.  Nope.  No.  That's why I'm saying it's not going to be good.  Yeah.  Hi-oh.  That'd be crazy.  Oh, wow.  Did he just text again?  Well, I told him that Scott wants to talk to you guys, and he said, great, I am fired.  Do you want him to come in when he gets there? 
[02:37:00]  Why is this funny to us?  Hold on, let me write it back.  I mean, it ain't...  Oh.  What are you going to write?  There's a good chance that that could happen.  Yeah.  Okay, I'm going to write him back to make him feel better.  Oh, I'm sure.  To make him feel better.  What did you say?  Dude, chill.  You'll probably appreciate it.  Yeah.  Hello.  Yeah, it's like, don't worry.  Tell me to chill.  Right.  Everything's fine.  I'll just chillax that.  In the meantime.  Yeah.  Have you checked your Twitter?  No.  Everyone is...  Can we give away the punchline now, or... 
[02:37:30]  No.  No.  No.  No, no.  Wait for Roley.  Wait for Ro-Ro?  Do you want him to come in when he gets there?  He's on 42nd right now.  Of course.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right here.  Yeah.  Jimmy told me to chill out.  Everybody except for Roland is probably aware of the punchline, but...  Yeah.  Can you come in right when you...  And also, right, right, things are getting pretty heated.  Things are getting heated.  Yeah.  Yeah, tell him to come straight to the studio. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  I did.  Oh, poor boy.  Poor little Roland.  Oh, my God.  Poor Roland.  You told me to chill out.  Tell Roland we made ABC News.  You want me to...  Yes, tell him that...  I swear to God, they just posted this 14 minutes ago.  ABC News.  ABC News is picking up on us, talking about it, and they just put it on their website.  Oh, no. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, Roland.  All right.  I mean, that's not a lie.  ABC News has picked it up.  It says the headline...  Tell him the headline says, Metallica set the headline, legendary venue.  And then write, oh, no, after it.  Posted 14 minutes ago.  Oh, oh, oh.  Posted 14 minutes ago.  I wrote, ugh.  Yeah.  Did you write that?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Can you come in right when you get here?  Things are getting heated.  ABC News has picked it up.  Ugh.  Right.  Oh, he thinks he's so fired. 
[02:39:00]  Poor boy.  You're writing to him.  Yeah.  What?  What are you telling him now, Jimmy?  Seriously.  Chill.  No, I wrote something.  Dude, it's exciting!  Exclamation point.  This is so fucking mean.  He's our friend.  Oh, he's like a little puppy.  It's a terrible work environment.  He's a panda.  Sal, are we getting the panda angry?  Don't get the panda angry! 
[02:39:30]  And then there's the panda.  Listen to the panda.  Listen to the...  Wait, wait.  There we go.  I love right to the end.  Yeah.  It's a lion.  It's a lion, right?  Don't tell the truth.  Oh, oof.  Sorry, guys.  It's a little levity.  Good one, Sal.  I miss the girls.  You do?  Yeah.  What were their names?  What?  Jackie and fucking...  What's her name?  No. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  It's, of course, Sydney.  The, um...  I just miss, you know, coming in the door and getting a,  Good morning!  Yeah.  I know.  From the...  I waved to you today.  The playroom.  Yeah, exactly.  From the playroom.  Exactly.  The playroom.  From summer camp office.  Oh, Roland's here.  He's Roland.  Oh, boy.  He's Roland.  Oh, no.  He's walking out.  That's cool, though.  Roland.  Roland.  Yes.  How was your commute? 
[02:40:30]  Oh, fantastic.  TMZ just picked it up.  Great.  What?  Yeah.  We're on TMZ.  That's fucking awesome.  Yeah, we're awesome.  Congratulations.  What happened?  It's exciting.  I'm going to text Troy, see if he wants to beach me today.  Why?  I mean...  You think you're in trouble?  Come on.  Well, you think there's some level of professionalism when we say don't see anything.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And I love you at all.  It's just...  But we're getting our names out there.  Just hit Google. 
[02:41:00]  Google News.  Just hit Google?  Yeah.  Should I look it up?  Oh, fantastic.  Show them the ABC headline.  That's the best one.  Oh, wow.  Who told you that this has to be kept quiet?  Metallica set the headline last year.  Oh, shit.  ABC News.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Oh.  Who told...  And this is just like a fun thing that they're adding.  And while Apollo is known for its Sandman character, Enter Sandman is one of Metallica's  famous songs. 
[02:41:30]  Oh.  I did not know that.  Oh, fun.  What...  Roland.  Yes, sir.  Who said that this really has to be kept quiet?  Well, you just...  You always get those sense of secrets.  Like, when you guys talk here and you guys look at us, we're like, okay, that information  should keep quiet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This one, it was tough to keep quiet, though.  So I didn't know that...  And then that's why I said that when Jim was concerned about, like, what about this?  I go, don't worry.  We're taking care of this, this, and this for you.  Everything will be taken care of.  So we're going to get tickets?  You think we'll get tickets?  Yay. 
[02:42:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  And I emailed the guy.  He's calling them today to talk to them.  Thank you.  Yeah.  So it's confirmed?  This one was a little too exciting.  Metallica?  I don't know.  Apollo Theater?  Confirmed?  Is it confirmed?  I guess you guys take care of the PR department work.  We go home.  Mission accomplished.  That's what we do if we do Mars' job.  Everyone's thanking us on Twitter, which is cool.  That big stump is probably Hillary. 
[02:42:30]  Now, do you think, why do you think you're in trouble here?  I don't know.  You know how this place works.  It's like, you go on the air, you talk, and they go, oh, it's fine.  And then you hear other things like, oh, well, you're not on the air.  And if we could speak, before you got here, I mean, you said on the air that you got the information from Roland.  I got my information from Sam.  Oh.  I just heard about it just now.  Well, everybody pretty much heard from Roland.  See, that's why he thinks. 
[02:43:00]  I thought it was exciting.  It's very exciting.  I don't know.  It's another one of these legendary performers at a legendary venue.  I guess if you're a fan, it'll be woo-hoo.  Roland.  Now the show's making some headlines.  Roland.  Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  Yeah, we're cool.  It's okay.  We'll be all right.  All right.  Well, we'll get you through this one.  Yay.  But at least they're all on vacation today.  Who, Metallica? 
[02:43:30]  No.  Managing.  The Apollo?  Oh, management.  Management's on vacation?  Managio mente.  All of them?  I think the ones who yell are.  The ones who yell.  Oh, man.  There's already a fucking...  You guys were right.  It is exciting.  Thanks, Rolando's 99. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, that's so mean.  You're being credited.  That's kind of cool, Roland.  Somebody made a photo of Metallica, and on top it says Metallica at the Apollo 921, and  on the bottom it says, thanks at Rolando's 99.  Yeah.  Which is Roland's Twitter handle.  Yeah.  Last time this happened, the guy's running for president now.  Christy.  Oh, and I see this.  Oh, right, right, right.  I remember that.  It had been flashbacks.  And that had to do with the Apollo Theater.  Right.  Yeah.  No, that was the Garden.  No, that was the Garden. 
[02:44:30]  Okay, the Garden.  Right, right.  Oh, I forgot about that.  But still, though, I didn't think he was going to become running for president.  My bad.  Are you going to go?  Where?  Metallica.  No, thank you.  Apollo Theater.  No, I'd rather have a fan go.  September 21st.  I'd rather have a fan go than...  What, you don't want to see Metallica?  No.  Why?  I have no interest.  Then why would you announce this?  I'm not announcing it.  It just was...  Why would you announce this to everybody?  You don't even care about the fan.  If it's about the thumb bookings, I said, don't worry, we're working on it.  Oh, cool.  See?  Because Roland told Jimmy... 
[02:45:00]  I didn't say nothing.  And then Jimmy told...  And then Jimmy told...  In confidence, though, I think.  ...me.  No, he didn't say anything about the...  Yeah, we didn't know.  ...secret.  Oh.  Well, me.  I just heard...  You gotta blame Jimmy.  I was like, get the fuck out of here.  And he goes, no, Roland, you know, it's probably good information.  And it was, apparently.  I guess.  Are they...  And we're desperate for attention over here, so we've said, fuck it, let's do this.  Is it all signed?  I don't know.  The venue's secured? 
[02:45:30]  Let's ask the...  Because I hear tell, maybe the venue's not secured yet.  Oh, boy.  Let's ask...  Let's ask her on air reporter, Mr. Greg Hughes.  Hey, hey, hey.  Why are you panicking?  You are freaking out, Roland.  This is the hell that is my life.  Oh, my God.  Everybody, dude, everybody's psyched about it.  Yeah.  Oh, yay.  It's only good news, right?  It's all good, right?  It is.  Until the wizard comes. 
[02:46:00]  I can't imagine this would actually be a problem.  No worries.  Right?  Hopefully the wizard gets stuck in that subway.  Please, Jesus.  Do your magic.  We saw your tsunamis.  We saw your tsunamis.  They stay stuck in the subway.  Yeah.  It does seem like sensitive information.  Was it, though?  How sensitive was this?  Scale of one to ten.  Ten being, like, fucking...  I heard other people yapping in the hallways, so... 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  Fuck them and bring them all down.  Wow.  Hallways are a little different than on air, though.  Especially on this giant show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take a chart, too.  That's what they said.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We should go to break, I guess.  Yay.  Oof.  It's going to be awkward when we're off the air.  Are you going to yell at us when we're off the air? 
[02:47:00]  Or are we going to just crawl on the table and take a shit and just walk right out?  I don't want to go to break.  I know.  It's all fun when we're talking into the mic, and then you go to break, and we've got to  look at Roland and...  Aw.  Like a real person?  Yeah.  Did we let you down?  What?  Did we?  We didn't let you down, did we?  Let's rewind the history of the show.  It's fun.  It's one of the bumps, as we say.  I feel bad now.  Yeah.  That happens. 
[02:47:30]  What are you going to do, right?  Yeah, you know.  We should be good.  Let's see more dicks in the ass.  You think this is a dick in the ass situation?  No.  This is probably like a Puerto Rican dick in the ass.  It's a little bit bigger than others.  Oh, wow.  Gee.  Thanks for the fan who made that.  Like, yeah, yeah.  You leaving some nasty comments on his Instagram later?  I'm going to find his children picture and post them.  Ah, that's a good one.  I'm going to find out where he works and then shit on him and his company.  That's one of my favorite things to do, by the way, is find the pictures of their kids. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  When somebody really fucks with you on Twitter, you just fucking dig, dig, dig into their Instagram,  into their fucking...  You look way early on in their Twitter account.  You have to keep going back, though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to keep going.  But you go, like, years back, because when they originally got Twitter, that's when people  post the most pictures, you know, because they're all excited and shit, and that's where  you find their pictures.  And then you go, wow, what a fucking cross-eyed looking dork kid you have. 
[02:48:30]  And then they cancel their account.  Well, they call me fat.  He's on Instagram.  His wife says, fat.  I go, can your wife join me for the biggest loser?  That fat whore?  What?  Wow, we were keeping it fun.  Whoa, whoa.  Take it a little too far.  Look at his eyes.  They're a little crazy.  But the wife is good, too.  You go after the wife, girlfriend, fucking anything.  Yes.  Go for the throat.  There are your feelings.  Right?  Yes.  We were just doing good, exciting news today.  That's what I thought.  Yeah, the news is Metallica, the Apollo Theater, thanks to Roland, September 21st. 
[02:49:00]  Confirmed as per Rolando's 99.  So you can thank him on Twitter.  Hey, fans.  Enjoy.  Oh, God.  He's freaking out.  Why are you freaking out?  I don't know.  Enough with the secrecy around here.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know what?  If we got info, we're going to fucking say it to the transparency.  Yeah, why wait till 10 o'clock?  That's right.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, what's so special about 10 o'clock? 
[02:49:30]  Who cares you got this info illegally?  We're fucking going to talk about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're part of the story.  We're going to get some hits, boys.  Yeah.  Oh, sweet Jesus.  Rylan.  Rylan.  Oh, no.  Now Edgar's fucking molesting him.  Do your duty and stop talking about Malika.  Oh, Malika.  What the fuck?  All right.  Good. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, Rolly.  So now they don't have to make the announcement at 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  You save them time, paperwork, and all that stuff.  What else are they going to talk about?  Like the fucking, what?  There's a channel?  No, the special opener.  Oh.  I'm just kidding.  I don't know.  There's a Metallica channel?  I don't know.  That's going to be kicking up?  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know in serious.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  No, that's pretty cool, though.  Yeah, it is very cool.  I would think.  I'll listen to that.  I'll fucking listen to that in a second.  Or listen to the Bruce channel.  Well.  She's the one I played today for you.  The Metallica channel thing was probably part of the big announcement that was supposed 
[02:50:30]  to be made later.  Oh, yeah?  I don't think that's been reported.  That probably came from Sam.  Oh, boy.  You're an ass, Sam.  I don't know.  I think, as I said, this is all news to me.  Yes, Sam.  Oh, gosh.  He winked at me.  You all right, Roland?  No, I should be all right.  This is serious accident.  At least we got to get health insurance.  Oh.  So I could go tell the doctor, remove the dick.  You think this is a dick in the ass situation?  I think so. 
[02:51:00]  I think he thinks that.  I don't think it is.  How big, though?  Chill.  Yeah, just chill, dude.  Puerto Rican dick in the ass.  Yeah, like a poe.  Did you get Jim's text to just chill?  Yeah, but you always say it was just chill all the time when I go freak out.  Yeah, why aren't you chilling?  If Jim says, just chill, that should be good enough.  It's all good.  Vacation's coming.  I get that from all these guys.  When things hit the fan, they're like, ah, don't worry.  And should we cut this from the replay?  Well, I would. 
[02:51:30]  It's too late.  Yeah, but now it's not just an announcement.  Yeah, now it's a giant segment.  Replay's going to be short.  It's already on fucking YouTube, probably.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think I'm taking a sick day today and just fucking just get wasted.  Fucking zoot it.  Yeah.  A little zootage.  That's like a nice morning shit and everything.  It was good.  Yeah, that was the shit.  It was good.  The entire thing, he texted and it was ruined.  Oh.  It's ruined.  This ruined your morning shit?  Yes. 
[02:52:00]  That I'm sorry about.  That is bad.  Well, how many people knew about this?  Probably now.  Check your Twitter.  No, I know.  I mean, the Twitter has exploded.  People are very excited about Metallica, the Apollo Theater.  September 21st, thanks to Roland.  And the new Metallica channel.  Right.  That's going to be launching here on SiriusXM.  What?  Mandatory Metallica.  Mandatory Metallica.  Are we doing Mandatory Metallica?  That's the name of the channel.  Nice.  That's the name of the channel, Mandatory Metallica.  Wow.  Where'd you hear that?  That's sweet.  Roland.  Oh, Roland. 
[02:52:30]  Why would you?  You guys got my email?  Awesome.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, this is scary, Roland.  I hate this version of Roland.  I know.  It's not fun.  It's scary, Roland.  No one wants to go to break.  Nothing.  Ah, gosh.  It'll be all right.  It'll be fine.  Don't sweat it.  We'll try to talk to the bosses today.  I checked it.  I got to leave right away.  Well, I mean, you got to leave right here.  I got to talk to the bosses.  If they want to meet us in the elevator, that's great. 
[02:53:00]  Or maybe if you...  I don't want to overstep my boundaries.  Maybe if you guys could Skype in for me.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  I can't take this.  Oh.  I feel bad, Roland.  Yeah.  It's got to suck to be in the know like you are.  You know, and then we have to do what we do.  No, but he's never going to tell us anything again.  But we have to.  Why do you have to?  I was so psyched to hear this yesterday.  I know. 
[02:53:30]  Absolutely.  Run onto the radio and talk about it, right?  Had good dreams of me running around, chocolate fountains.  And then you woke up to this.  There's shit everywhere.  That's ironic.  I'm just not looking at anyone.  That's not good.  Like the chocolate fountains.  Now there's shit everywhere.  Never free.  Never me.  Yeah.  Say it about true.  Don't remain unforgiven.  I hope we don't remain unforgiven.  Yes.  Yeah.  It is exciting. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Huge brand, small venue.  Maybe I might as well do it now before I get asked.  Slabo!  I know for my last slabo.  It's not your last slabo.  I know if I get yelled at.  Why would you get yelled at?  Yeah.  They like meetings here.  You told us something.  You go, can I see for three seconds?  And you go, oh.  Look, you told us something.  We couldn't help ourselves.  So the beans, you, you know, you don't have a radio show.  They're afraid of you. 
[02:54:30]  No.  That's true.  Yeah, it's true.  Yeah.  I love that.  Once they hear that Dean in the elevator closed, they're like, oh, we need to see you for a minute.  I'm like, oh.  Oh, and then they'll take it out on you?  Of course.  Oh, man.  Well, we won't allow that.  Management 101, Chapter 4.  Yeah.  Dicks in the ass.  We will not allow that, and we'll stay behind you 100%.  Do you have my Escalade number for when I'm driving home?  I do.  If you need it.  No.  I'll slice your tires.  Oh, shit.  Here it comes.  The scary Roland. 
[02:55:00]  Here it comes.  Run away, man.  Oh.  It's in my blood.  Oh.  Yeah, you can't go to break.  Why?  No, this is scary.  No, because there will be venom at the break.  Come on, Roland.  Now we're all having a good time.  He just starts choking people out.  No, I'll just bite Sam.  Oh.  Why do you bite me?  You always take your anger out on me.  Should, uh, maybe Roland should leave the studio.  Before we go to break.  Because I'm a little scared of you. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Don't forget people.  Apollo.  Woo.  Oh, God.  Oh.  You should have more excitement.  Oh, no.  Not this music.  What is it?  It's the Hulk slowly walking away music.  Sad Hulk.  You want to give out your last slobo?  Sure.  Slaboo.  Slaboo.  Oh.  That was a sad one.  It was a sad one.  That is a sad slobo. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  I don't know.  He doesn't want to leave the air either because he knows that...  That's probably it.  You know?  I'm just just uncomfortable in this.  What's up?  Oh, this is uncomfortable.  I know.  The reality is right outside the door.  Boy.  Yeah.  It's fantasy in here.  You get all the credit now instead of some nobody on this platform.  Yeah.  Oh.  Since you put it that way, it felt a lot better.  We're in all the headlines.  It's nice. 
[02:56:30]  It's nice to have our names out there a little bit.  I just don't think this is the way the company that put together the event foresaw this.  Company schmumpany.  Yeah.  Well, at 10 o'clock when they make the big announcement, make-believe you don't know.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Just fake it.  When someone says that, just go, oh.  Oh, I heard that at 10.  I didn't know about this.  Do tell.  Whoa.  Ta-da.  I better tune in the metal station.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they go, do-do, do-do, do-do. 
[02:57:00]  Guess what?  The guys are announced, Dad.  Check their Twitter.  Yay.  All right.  We're going to go to break.  Yay.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going to go order bacon.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go order bacon.  I will.  We'll try to figure out a way out of this.  Oh, he's walking away with the slow walking away music.  Oh, no.  He's kicking dirt behind him.  He just kicked dirt behind him.  Like a cat bearing a doody.  There he goes.  I love the glass.  He's so mad. 
[02:57:30]  Hang on.  He's about to go into the production studio so he'll be able to hear.  Yeah.  Is he going into the CD rock?  Yeah.  He's in there.  E-Rock, turn on the mics.  Could you?  Could you?  I roll.  I roll.  I roll.  You all right?  When you check the internet, you can't hear.  You release press release.  I think he did because he said it on the air.  Oh, no.  It's serious release.  All right.  You all right? 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are you breathing?  Mm-hmm.  That's what murderers do.  Breathe.  You okay?  Mm-hmm.  Three press releases.  And is there one?  Mm-hmm.  Those fuckers.  They fucking want to eat.  They're going to eat a piece of shit.  There's a piece of shit.  There's three press releases here.  God damn it.

[03:03:00]  Friends of the Show.  Audio entertainment courtesy of the people you hear and hear about on the Opie and Anthony  show.  This week, Tom Papa's SiriusXM show, Come to Papa.  Welcome, everybody, to a West Coast version of Come to Papa.  I'm Tom Papa.  Make sure you watch my new special, Freaked Out.  You can watch it on epicshd.com.  It's hilarious.  It'll be coming to Netflix and iTunes this fall.  Go to tompapa.com for tour dates.  And yes, this is a West Coast version.  I am in Los Angeles, California, where it could be summer or not. 
[03:03:30]  It just doesn't matter because the sun is always shining and the air is always soft.  And after a little while, it starts to make me a little nervous.  And the way that I center myself is to seek out comedians because it does not matter where  on the planet you are.  A comedian brings just the right amount of insight and cloudiness to calm the soul.  Today, I'm excited to finally sit down with the very talented comedian Tom Rhodes. 
[03:04:00]  Tom and I have been trying to do this since we ran into each other at the Improv last summer.  And that's how things happen with the comedian Tom Rhodes.  You don't see him for a long time.  Then you run into him in a random street corner under a street light.  He makes you laugh.  And then he vanishes.  First and foremost, Tom is a stand-up comedian.  He's had success in Comedy Central, his own NBC sitcom, Mr. Rhodes.  But it is his calling to be a stand-up comedian.  And he does it in a global way.  Literally all over the world.  All over Europe, South America, Peru, France, Russia, Wales, Aruba, even New Jersey are some 
[03:04:30]  of the places Tom has performed in.  Go to TomRhodes.net for his specials, his comedy albums.  You can listen to his great show, Tom Rhodes Radio, which can also be found on iTunes and  allthingscomedy.com.  Tom, you've traveled the entire planet.  Is there anything more special on the planet than being here on Come to Papa right now?  Not a single thing. 
[03:05:00]  Not anywhere.  No, no, no place in Europe I'm thinking I'm missing out on.  No.  Gelatos in Rome.  No.  No.  Brazilian women.  Wine bars in Paris.  No.  Nothing's better than this.  This is really the peak.  Yeah.  Well, it was kind of funny when I was actually thinking about you coming.  In a way, all of your travels have led to this moment.  Everything.  Everything I've done in my career has led up to this moment.  It really has. 
[03:05:30]  Not that this will be the last moment.  You're going to go someplace else, but for now.  And then everything else will be building up to the next time we get together.  Right.  Exactly.  No, but seriously, I mean, this is kind of a very cool thing, and I'm sure you talk about  it a lot, but I really want to talk about it because I'm completely intrigued.  You are really on this global level.  I mean, you had real success here early on in your career, and you're still very successful  here, but you branched out and started going over to Europe, I think, initially, and you 
[03:06:00]  were really, I mean, now it's becoming a little more commonplace for people to go different  places and do stand-up, but people were not doing that when you started.  I mean, when did Mr. Rhodes end?  That was...  Uh, 97.  97?  Yeah.  98, 99.  I moved to New York City.  Uh-huh.  And then it was 98, 99 that I started systematically making strategic trips to London. 
[03:06:30]  And what was strategic trips?  Greg Proops and Rich Hall, good friends of mine.  Okay.  And they helped me get in over there.  They said I would do very well.  And so, you know, I started out in Florida, and then I moved to San Francisco in my early  20s.  Right.  But in order to get in with San Francisco, I had to take two or three trips out there,  sleep on a friend's couch, and do free guest sets.  Why did you pick San Francisco?  And so I did...  I always thought a higher intelligence of comedy came out of there.  Gotcha. 
[03:07:00]  And in my opinion, stand-up comedy was invented in San Francisco by Mark Twain.  Uh-huh.  Um...  Really?  In San Francisco?  Yeah.  He gave live speaking engagements, and they were always humorous.  Right.  So in my opinion, he was the man that started stand-up comedy.  Uh-huh.  So to get in with London, people ask me, how did you get in with Europe?  It's no secret.  It's how you get in with anywhere.  Right.  You invest in trips over, and then you do, you know, you sleep on a friend's couch, get  a hotel.  Right.  And do guest sets. 
[03:07:30]  Right.  And that's how I got in with London.  And then I started playing in London pretty frequently, and once you get in with London,  all these fabulous international tours are booked out of London.  Uh-huh.  And then that led to gigs all over Europe and Australia and, you know, Hong Kong and China.  British people are everywhere, and they love stand-up comedy.  Right.  So you got people in China doing these very well-paid jobs, and they're just starving  for entertainment. 
[03:08:00]  Right.  So when you, were you thinking of it as just let me go explore, or were you thinking, I've  done the TV thing, let me blow out for a while?  No, I mean, I've always still done half the year playing all over the states.  Right.  You know, a lot of my favorite clubs, I still do once a year.  San Francisco Punchline, Atlanta Punchline, Chicago Zanies.  So it was purely just let me go see where I can, where this will take me.  It just worked out.  I mean, I've always been adventurous, and I had played in everywhere in the states already. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, right.  And I wanted to see if my material was strong enough to work in other countries, especially  England.  Right.  You know?  Is it competitive?  How's the London scene change, or how's it changed internationally?  Well, London has changed.  They're seen, I think it's like a teeter-totter, a seesaw.  Yeah.  When we're up, they're down.  When we're down, they're up.  Oh, yeah?  Because when we had our period where comedy wasn't thriving in the media and on television, 
[03:09:00]  for the last 20 years in England, it's been on fire.  Right.  And now, they've been oversaturated the way we were in the late 80s, early 90s, and people  thought, well, why would I go to a club when I can just see every comedian on television?  Right.  And so that's what, so it's the same thing that happened here that has happened in England  now.  A lot of clubs closed, and the scene shrunk, and only the strong survive. 
[03:09:30]  Right.  But, I mean, I'm going over there now.  I'm playing in theaters.  I'm at the Soho Theater.  I hear that's a good one.  It's a monster room.  And before, I would go there, and I would just, I would play, like, the comedy store  in different clubs, and I would be on an evening of comedy.  Right.  But now, I'm playing, like, little theaters, and it's Tom Rhodes.  Tom Rhodes, yeah.  Oh, that's good.  So, and the Soho Theater is the crown jewel of theaters.  I was supposed to go there for the first time, I think, like, in October, and it just 
[03:10:00]  fell through because of something else, but I've been craving going over there.  It's awesome.  I highly recommend it.  This is why I'm so intrigued by your life, because here we are in my house right now.  I wish you'd have told me you had a pool.  I'd have brought my suit.  And we've got, you can see, as you look around, we have some hippity hops and Hello Kitty  shoes.  Right.  And stuff like that, and you, and I, I thought that I was coming to L.A. and just running  into where you live, but tell our listeners where you live. 
[03:10:30]  I live in these shoes.  You don't have an address.  I do not have an address.  You are, you are literally just a traveling.  I lived in Amsterdam for five years.  We can talk about that in a minute.  And then I moved, I moved to L.A. for two years, and I was on the road most of the time.  Right.  Paying rent on a place that I was never at and wasn't that crazy about.  Right.  So, I just threw everything into storage.  And I've had everything in storage for seven years now.  Wow. 
[03:11:00]  And I used to have my mail sent to my dad's house, and he helped me, and then he was killed  by a drunk driver, and now my mom helps me with that.  When was he killed by a drunk driver?  2009.  Oh, man.  Sorry about that.  Yeah.  Shit hurts.  Yeah.  He was, I know he was a big influence in your life.  My dad's the reason I'm a comedian.  My dad had comedy albums.  My dad loved comedy.  My dad, my family is originally from Washington, D.C.  We moved to Florida when I was like 13.  Okay. 
[03:11:30]  And that's where I started on comedy.  But my uncle did stand-up comedy in Washington, D.C.  He did open mic nights for one year.  And I read he brought you on stage.  No, it wasn't him.  Oh.  And my dad took me to see him.  Oh, okay.  And the entrance was by the front door.  Right.  And I was wearing a Washington Redskins jacket.  Right.  And the comedian that was on stage pulled me on stage, and he interviewed me like I was the  coach of the Redskins.  And that moment changed my life.  How old were you?  I mean, I was 12.  I was bashful, dopey, kid, one-word answers.  Yes.  Yes and no. 
[03:12:00]  But that moment changed my life.  I'll never forget standing on that stage, seeing all these happy people and their happy  faces.  Yeah.  And all the teeth in their mouth.  You know, and their heads thrown back in laughter.  And like from that moment forward, you know, up to then I wanted to be a major league baseball  player.  And at that point I was like, screw baseball.  So then I started, you know, writing jokes and keeping little notebooks and stuff.  And then when I was 17, I started in Florida.  Really?  So...  And my father drove me to my first open mic night. 
[03:12:30]  He did?  Yeah.  My dad, totally the reason I'm a comedian.  So he knew that you weren't just...  When you were writing all that stuff before you were 17, so between 13 and 17.  Yeah.  I'd be like, yeah, do you think this is funny?  It's usable.  And then like...  And he was a fan.  I used to remember TV Guide.  I mean, I used to...  I would look...  We'd get...  We would get the TV Guide.  Yeah.  And I would take a highlighter and I would highlight all the nights that comedians would  be on Carson.  Wow.  And then later Letterman and stuff.  Wow.  And so, I mean, I studied it. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  I became a student of stand-up comedy.  Jeez.  And then I...  And every, you know, comedy albums...  I loved Woody Allen.  And then Rodney Dangerfield.  And then around the time I was starting, or maybe two years in, when I was about 19,  Sam Kinison popped.  That HBO Dangerfield.  Yeah.  And those just, you know, comedy live albums, you know, were my fuel.  Who was your father's favorites?  My dad loved Pryor. 
[03:13:30]  Pryor.  My dad loved Pryor.  I mean, not only did he have the vinyl records, he had the cassette.  And we'd drive around in his car listening to him.  Wow.  And my dad also loved Cosby.  Oh, yeah.  So it was kind of the yin and yang of comedy.  You know, dirty, kind of explicit and clean family guy.  And then my father also loved Bob Newhart.  Oh, wow.  And I, I mean, those...  This is good stuff.  Those comedy albums, I remember, you know, remember the big vinyl record player, the 
[03:14:00]  family entertainment centers that everybody had in the living room?  Sure.  I would play those Bob Newhart records and just be rolling around on the carpet.  They were so precious.  Beautiful.  You would take them out of the case and put it on there and that gentle needle to the  thing.  I mean, they were like, you really treasured these things.  It wasn't just like download, hit.  My dad was a pretty smooth guy, man.  And he also had tons of Ray Charles and Sam Cooke.  Man.  So, I mean, that's like...  What a good influence. 
[03:14:30]  That's what I grew up listening to.  That's so great.  Yeah.  And he was, he was in Vietnam.  He was a vet, right?  Yeah, yeah.  My father flew helicopters in Vietnam and he was shot down.  Oh, really?  And everybody died except for him and one other guy, his crew chief, co-pilot.  Jeez.  And he unhooked that guy, dragged him across a field under heavy fire and a couple hours  later they got picked up and he got like, he got like five medals for this one incident. 
[03:15:00]  Do you get to go home after you do something like that?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And my father's buried in Arlington National Cemetery.  And, you know, they don't let anybody be buried in Arlington anymore.  You have to be a pretty badass war hero.  Is that a Purple Heart?  He got that, yeah.  Wow.  That's pretty bad.  And the Distinguished Flying Cross and...  Did it, did it, I don't want to say mess him up, but was he able to talk about it?  He seems like he was...  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:15:30]  I mean, my father had a really dark sense of humor.  And I have a really twisted sense of humor.  And the Vietnam Veteran, the Helicopter Pilots Association, those were his tightest buddies.  Yeah.  And once a year, 4th of July week, they have a reunion.  They still do it.  Right.  And so that was his big thing.  Right.  And he was tight with him.  And he, you know, I think his dark humor helped him get through.  Right.  And could he talk to you about it?  Yeah.  But, I mean, I didn't know until after he died all the real specifics of the incident that happened when he was shot down. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Because I got to look through his stuff and see what I wanted to keep.  And I found this letter from the Army saying specifically what happened.  There were these guys stuck on the ground.  Yeah.  And they're all getting shot at.  And so he's trying to fly down and pick up these, like, 12, 15 guys.  Wow.  And they made three attempts.  And then they had to keep pulling up and circling around because there's so much heavy fire. 
[03:16:30]  And on the fourth time, they get down.  And all these guys jump on.  And they're lifting off.  And the helicopter taking so much heavy fire, it crashed.  And then everybody died except him and the co-pilot.  Jeez.  So pretty intense.  Pretty intense.  Where did he drag the guy off?  Do you know?  No.  I mean, like, into some bushes.  And they were there for, like, a few hours before someone could get in and get them.  Jeez.  So I never knew the specifics like that.  Yeah.  I mean, I knew he was shot down.  And he saved the guy's life. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  And that a bunch of people had died.  But I didn't know about them.  Right.  So he's into all this comedy.  And he's into all this great music.  When you know him as just a dad.  Was he?  My family's from Washington, D.C.  So there's always been a very African-American element to our family lingo and influence.  And my father was somewhat of a black man.  Yeah.  Interesting.  That's cool. 
[03:17:30]  Because you have that element on stage.  You have a very, there is a black element to your act.  Soulful.  Soulful.  Yeah.  Soulful.  Right, exactly.  Why should they own it?  So your dad is this influence.  And you are sitting there writing jokes.  And your dad drives you where?  In Florida to the first open mic?  Yeah, Orlando.  And he sits in the audience while you go up and do your thing?  Actually, I asked him if he would stay in the car.  You did.  And he stayed in the car. 
[03:18:00]  And I went in.  And then it was actually really cool.  Because then on the drive home, and I had gone over the act with him.  Yeah.  What I was going to do.  Uh-huh.  So then on the drive home, I told him, okay, this worked.  That was good.  And oh, this stuff didn't work here.  And then, ooh, I almost forgot this.  And you know, it was really great to go over the whole thing with him.  Jeez.  And then I went back like a week or two later.  And then he drove me and came in with me.  Oh, he did?  And my dad just went to thousands of shows.  Really? 
[03:18:30]  And saw me everywhere.  And my parents were divorced.  And my father and I had this tradition.  Because I would spend Christmas with my mom.  Uh-huh.  And my dad would always come to see me on New Year's Eve.  So he came and saw me in London and wherever I was.  Oh, wow.  It was awesome.  Yeah.  So you really opened up places for him to go spend some cool New Year's Eve.  Yeah, and then when I had that sitcom, he was living in Anaheim.  He sat in the front row for every taping.  Wow.  You know.  That's awesome.  My father's is very similar. 
[03:19:00]  Where if I'm like within 100 miles of where he is, there's a good chance he'll show up.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And it's a strange thing, though.  Because a lot of times comedians hate when their family's there.  Right?  Don't you hear that's the norm?  Right.  You always hear like, or the family wishes they would have done something else.  Right.  Or whatever.  My family was never like that.  My family was always glad I wasn't in jail.  Yeah.  And I found something to do with my life.  Were you kind of a wild kid where that could have been a possibility? 
[03:19:30]  Smart enough not to get in trouble.  Right.  I was pretty wild, but I'd never been arrested.  No?  No.  But you were a little, you were, you were a little crazy.  Not bad things.  Right.  Not bad things.  Right.  No real, no real crimes against humanity.  So when you're doing this at an early age, is there even an idea in your head that maybe  you'll have a straight job?  Or are you just thinking?  Never, never, ever even crossed my mind to do anything else.  No.  No. 
[03:20:00]  Even the, the, the really tough years, the first 10 years where, I mean, when I first  went on the road, I didn't have a car.  I used to take Greyhound.  No.  And, oh my God, I took Greyhound buses from Florida to Michigan a few times to do one  nighters.  No.  And even had to hitchhike a few times to get to some gigs.  Holy cow.  And, you know, it was pretty tough.  But even back then, I never even, I was loving it.  I was like, you know, I had read Kerouac in high school and just the, the thrill of travel  and, you know.  The road. 
[03:20:30]  Getting out on the road.  Yeah.  It's so awesome.  So what brings you to San Francisco?  You figure, well, it's, that's the scene.  I didn't want to be an actor.  I, uh, always thought a higher intelligence of comedy came out of San Francisco.  Yeah.  And.  Who was there at that time?  That's Proops and.  At that time, the scene was incredible.  You had, uh, Greg Proops, uh, Mark Maron, Patton Oswalt, uh, Margaret Cho.  Right.  I'm forgetting a lot of people, but I mean, there was a really magnificent scene there. 
[03:21:00]  And was Dana Carvey around there at that time?  No, I think he'd already launched.  But I mean, you can see him now in Mill Valley.  Yeah.  At the Throckmorton.  Right.  And Robin Williams pops in there.  But.  Yeah.  There was such a great scene.  And, um, I remember whatever year it was that free weekly, the Guardian ran a front page  thing saying that comedy was dead.  And it was a little caricature on it.  It said, take my schtick, please.  And I had like some hack looking comic adjusting his tie. 
[03:21:30]  Uh-huh.  And they stopped running comedy listings.  No.  And I am the person who remembers and will shame them because at that time you had the  best in the future of American stand-up comedy there.  Right.  And Dana Gould.  Right.  Uh, and then Mitch Hedberg was coming around after a few years.  Yeah.  Uh, who else was there?  I mean.  Jeez.  God.  Uh, Greg Barrett.  I'm forgetting a bunch of people.  Yeah.  But that was, man.  No, that's a big list already. 
[03:22:00]  There was so many great comedians there.  At that time when they're saying comedy's dead.  Comedy's dead.  Ugh.  Jeez.  Yeah.  I think it became fashionable to kind of say that at that time, right?  I mean, there was kind of like.  Right.  Well, like you're talking about what happened in England.  I mean, it was oversaturated.  Right.  Every cable channel had a guy standing in front of a brick wall.  Yeah.  But that wasn't the San Francisco scene.  It was never a brick wall, hacky.  Right.  Comedy town.  Yeah.  So like, you know, how dare they compare it to like some shit that's happening on the 
[03:22:30]  road.  Right.  Exactly.  To some place in like Orlando or something.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  And Florida had a real bad reputation for really bad comedians.  Yeah.  But a lot of great comedians came out of there.  Yeah.  Brian Regan.  Brian Regan.  Right.  Daniel Tosh started in Orlando.  Right.  Jim Brewer started in Tampa.  Billy Gardell started in Orlando.  Yeah.  No, they were everywhere.  There's a lot of great comedians rebelled against that Florida image. 
[03:23:00]  It is funny that once in a while I'll catch on, on HBO, you know, when they have the half  hours or the standup things.  And every once in a while you'll catch kind of a guy and I can't even remember their names.  There was one guy I saw who was the typical thing of what made comedy so swarmy and bad.  It was just this.  Do you remember who it was?  These late.  No, there's this one guy though that was, I was, I can't remember his name and it's probably, 
[03:23:30]  my conscience won't let me, but it was just that kind of lazy.  See, I'm just going to put it out there and we're all just going to agree it's funny without  me doing the work of making it funny.  I'm not showing you anything deeper than here it is.  And you could see why.  I mean, I started when this was, it had kind of all happened, was officially in trouble,  but you could see there must've been a lot of those guys playing a lot of rooms.  There were.  And there was, you know what, there was a lot of, I'll tell you what, half of the scene 
[03:24:00]  was hack New York comedians would come down and there was a really stinky, smelly kind  of New York hack that would come down and like, you know, I'm on the subway, right?  No, we're in Florida.  We don't have a subway.  Could you at least alter your show to, with it, we could somewhat relate to it.  But I'll tell you the transformation in my career, because when I, the first few years  I was just, you know, anything that sticks, you're doing. 
[03:24:30]  And you're not even thinking of portraying your personality, but Ron Bennington opened  up Ron Bennington's comedy scene in Clearwater, Florida.  And he was the first comedian who I ever saw talking about things that mattered.  And then, so going down there, and I know he influenced a lot of people, like, you know,  and Jim Brewer started there or in that area.  He played there a lot.  A lot of great guys were influenced by what was happening in this room.  So, it wasn't all, it was in Clearwater. 
[03:25:00]  So, it wasn't all bad.  Right.  You know, there was this, this little, uh, crown jewel.  Yeah.  That Ron Bennington started.  And then around somewhere like a year later or two years, then Kinison came out.  Then it was like, then I had this epiphany, like, oh my God, you can talk about like pain  and knowledge and things that mattered.  Right.  So, and then, and then that got me thinking, and I had moved to New York City when I was 
[03:25:30]  20.  Okay.  And it was the worst year of my life.  Right.  I wasn't ready yet.  Right.  And I had already done that.  Comedically?  I wasn't, as a comedian.  Right.  I wasn't ready yet.  Yeah.  Uh, and I, I was living in Washington Heights as crack came to the neighborhood.  Oh, geez.  There'd be gunshots in the neighborhood and burned out cars.  Oh, man.  And it was, it was, it was too much of an expensive beast for me.  Yeah.  And I, I didn't, and, and, and, and it was just, um, I mean, I had done that and I, I  just, I just wanted to develop as a comedian. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  So, I moved to San Francisco because I, I thought, okay, this will be my, my university.  Right.  Of stand-up comedy.  Right.  Where I'd learned from Bennington and Kinison and what was happening in that Clearwater  room.  And then, and it's, it's not as much of sleeping with a dragon as Washington Heights filled  with crack.  Right.  That is intense.  I can't believe you were there during that.  That's like 90.  Oh, no.  Uh, we're talking like 88. 
[03:26:30]  88.  88.  Yeah.  I couldn't, there's no time that it was worse.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Right.  Exactly.  And you're, and all I could afford was Washington Heights.  Oh my God.  And you know, I always, uh, that jazz song, taking the A train.  Yeah.  I always, do you know how long it takes to get on the A train to midtown Manhattan from  Washington Heights?  It's like an hour, hour 15.  With the most horrible people.  Oh my God.  With the, with the roughest people on the planet.  Yeah.  You're there with your little notebook.  The roughest place kid from Florida. 
[03:27:00]  It'd be a little notebook.  Yeah.  You know, my little, Tommy and I probably had like, uh, you know, top side or boat shoes  on.  You don't even want to pull your set list out because it'll look like you're looking for  directions and people just hit you over the head.  Oh, that's brutal.  But because I had lived there like a dog, I always swore if I ever had any money, I'd  live in New York with style.  Yeah.  So when the sitcom finished, I moved to, uh, the wall street area and I got a rockstar  apartment.  You did.  Yeah.  It's such a different, and then the city looks totally different. 
[03:27:30]  And, um, urinated that money away as quickly as possible on the rent that I played for that.  How many seasons too?  The one.  One season?  Yeah.  But a full season.  Yeah.  And development money to start it off.  Yeah.  So you had some money to burn.  Yeah.  I remember when you hit, I remember when, that was 94?  Uh, yeah.  Around then.  Around then?  Yeah.  Exactly.  I just started.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I started in 93.  And I remember.  You started in 93?  Started in 93. 
[03:28:00]  Wow.  And I remember you hitting.  It was, it was excitement because you were around and, uh, your, Dave Becky was  your guy and who's now my manager.  And I just remember like the buzz, like it was like, you were like the story of what  could happen if you were able to be funny enough and hang out enough and get good enough.  Like, it was like, oh geez, that's how it's happening for this guy who's standing right  there at the bar.  I mean, this really, this is actually could happen. 
[03:28:30]  It was very, it was very hopeful.  And then I remember you going out and doing the show and I remember when it was over,  it's like, well, what happens now?  Like what happens to guys that, all right, so now, and then you just, you were in the  clubs and you were always headlining and you're always doing it.  It was like, oh, we can.  I never stopped.  Even when I had the show, I was still, I would still go out and do dates on the weekend.  I remember that very clearly.  And I, and you know, the insulting thing, um, you know, I had no control over that show 
[03:29:00]  and I had long hair and everything was a hair joke at me.  Hey Fabio, hey cream rinse.  And, uh, oh my, it was just so painful.  And then they wouldn't give me any jokes.  I played a school teacher and I had to give this nice advice to the kids.  And, and then, um, when it ended, you know, like a lot of radio guys are trying to be  all like, you know, hard hitting Howard Stern kind of people. 
[03:29:30]  And it was like, I'd, I'd go in to do these fricking morning radio shows around the country  and doing my gigs like I've done forever following my dream.  And it'd be like, oh, so you're back to comedy now after your failed sitcom.  Uh, I'm like, well, um, uh, you know, and it's like, yeah, I'm surprised I didn't punch  more people in the face in that period.  God, I could imagine.  No, there was a, that whole like, oh, you've come back to comedy.  Right.  Exactly.  I never left it.  Yeah. 
[03:30:00]  It's my, and then like, you know, I lived in Europe and people were like, oh, did you,  you think like, did you lose a step because you, you, you left America?  I didn't leave America.  Even when I was living in Amsterdam, I was still doing half the year.  Right.  Dates around the country.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Cause I never wanted my, uh, American comedy muscle to go soft.  Right.  And you know, it's another reason the relationship that I moved there for a Dutch girl, it didn't  work because I was constantly going back to the United States to do gigs.  Right.  And so like people's perception, I don't know. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  You know, oh, you're back in the States now.  What are you talking about?  Right.  I guess Europe didn't work out for you.  I'm wherever there's a microphone.  Right.  You're listening to come to pop on serious XM 99.  I'm here with my good friend, Mr. Tom Rhodes.  Make sure you go to Tom Rhodes.net and, uh, buy all of his comedy.  If you don't already have it.  He also has a, uh, a great podcast on all things comedy, which, uh, is a great group.  And, uh, go also to iTunes and check them out. 
[03:31:00]  What there is that thing though, Tom, I have to say, what's that?  You have a, you have a thing about you where when you're talking about, well, people have  this, like, so what you left and did TV or you left and you went and did Europe and I  guess you're back.  It's not an insult because there, you have a way about you that creates a mythology.  You have a vibe about you.  That's very cool.  And you're always, you really are do beat to your own drum. 
[03:31:30]  And even as a friend and a guy that admires you, there is this mythology.  Like you sit, you will have these moments where you're like, where's Tom Rhodes right  now?  Because you know, you're living this life of that's very different and it doesn't conform.  Even though you've done standup in the way that we have, and you've done TV the way that  mainstream people do, you have this way about you that is intriguing and it makes you think, 
[03:32:00]  well, where are you?  But people think about you when you're not around, you know?  Well, and you know what?  And that's the, the, the TV show that I'm trying to make is somewhat of, um, an extension  of what is my podcast.  I'm, I'm trying to make a, and I've pitched it to Comedy Central and the Travel Channel and I  don't know why, uh, cause comedy is now thriving all over the world with the exception of England.  And I want to make a comedy travel show.  I want to be the Anthony Bourdain of comedy, right? 
[03:32:30]  The way he goes around the world, he meets chefs and then he, and it's all about food.  What are people making jokes about in other countries?  And you know, um, I made, uh, I produced my own little pilot on Malaysia.  It's a Muslim country and there's a great comedy scene there.  I was just there really back there a few months ago.  You got Malay Muslims, Indian Hindus, and Chinese Christian or Buddhist.  That's their ethnic populace.  Right.  And that's their comedy scene.  And they all ruthlessly make fun of each other's religions. 
[03:33:00]  They're really more, um, free than we are in that regard because, you know, oh, if you're  not such and such, you can't make a joke about them and stuff like that.  But, um, my podcast, I, I interviewed comedians all over the world and I did the New Zealand  Comedy Festival in May.  And so there was some great Australian, English, New Zealand comedians I did.  And then I also got to do an interview with Kim.com.  He's, uh, the FBI, uh, the United States is trying to extradite him back to the States. 
[03:33:30]  He had mega upload.com.  Oh, right.  You may remember the FBI and the New Zealand army raided his mansion last year.  Yeah.  Right.  And so I did like the NPR of New Zealand and I was talking to like the Terry gross of,  of New Zealand, some, uh, cute lesbian speaking and hushed tones.  And she asked me, what did I want to do in New Zealand?  And I said, uh, I'd really like to interview Kim.com and the guy, some, he saw, he heard 
[03:34:00]  and, and I, I, he followed me on Twitter.  I followed him back and then we started communicating and he invited me to his mansion.  And so that's a great episode.  That's awesome.  Uh, and my, and it's my life traveling the world as a comedian.  And, uh, I don't, I mean, I understand that I'm not as young and cute as I used to be,  but I don't know why someone wouldn't want to make this a television show.  And I've got comedian friends all over the world.  There's great gigs all over the world. 
[03:34:30]  And there's just comedy happening.  They're just not seeing it.  They're not seeing it the right way because the cool thing that you find when you go and  do comedy around, I was in Beirut.  I haven't traveled that much, but I was able to do comedy in Beirut and just seeing in these  countries that we grow up frightened of as these scary places where they, they're not  even human.  And it's just like a scary place.  And then you meet young people that want to express, and this is the way the world is  changing that you can be in Malaysia and have people doing the same thing. 
[03:35:00]  Right.  And it's such a global movement and that you have, that you've been, you, you're not a  guy that just showed up in this movement.  I was at the forefront.  What did the Malaysia thing look like?  What was the pilot?  How long was the pilot that you shot?  I have it on YouTube.  Oh, you do?  And, uh, it's on, uh, Rhodes World is, I just started a new YouTube channel of just my travel  stuff.  My other Tom Rhodes channel has got a lot of standup and, and then travel clips of me 
[03:35:30]  in Peru and Russia and London and Paris everywhere.  But the, um, the Rhodes World channel has, uh, or you could just type in Tom Rhodes, Malaysia  and you'll find it.  You'll find it.  Yeah.  And, um, it's so great because I do, I've watched the Bourdain thing, not that many episodes,  but there is a cool, who's ever producing it does it in a cool way.  Cause you really do feel like you're hanging with them and you're discovering these little,  these places.  Right.  And I think with the right producer, that's a no brainer, the show for you. 
[03:36:00]  I would think, you know, uh, and I'm, uh, I've been working on a book that I hope to  have finished.  Oh yeah.  It was about my life as a comedian and a lot of adventures I've had.  And like, you know, the late night talk show I had in Amsterdam.  Yeah.  Let's talk about that for a minute.  Well, let me say one last thing about the, the Malaysian comedian said it as YouTube has  inspired standup comedy in countries where it's never existed before.  Right.  YouTube has opened people up and, and probably Russell Peters should be credited with that. 
[03:36:30]  So a lot of dark skinned Asian people discovered standup comedy through Russell.  I remember Russell telling me, he told me literally I was, I was made overnight and I  laughed and he goes, no, I'm serious because YouTube came out and all of these kids that  didn't have a voice comedically found him and they just started sharing them and propping  him up and he became really famous.  He told me that too.  I had him on my podcast and he said, yeah, he said there was some Canadian special he did 
[03:37:00]  and he made fun of all these races and it got chopped up and put on YouTube and then boom.  Yeah.  Over and out.  Because I was working, I met Russell, we were doing one nighters around England.  Really?  And so I said, how did you go from doing some crappy John Keys gigs around England to being  the superstar?  Superstar.  I mean, sells out huge arenas, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, everywhere.  And this is what's amazing about the planet now is that he could be that huge and people 
[03:37:30]  that we know who are pretty hip in America don't know who he is.  Have no idea who he is.  It's so crazy.  It's so hopeful too.  It's an amazing, pretty, it's that you can create your own little army and just have a  whole career.  Well, that's the beautiful thing about being a comedian now is, you know, I mean, it's  never been a better time to be a comedian.  You can do, I mean, as long as you're happy not making any money, you know, because I don't  have any advertising on my podcast. 
[03:38:00]  Right.  I love podcasts, but I hate the first 10, 20 minutes of buy this book and stamps and  whatever.  And then also, I don't have any commercials on my YouTube channel because of the pennies  they would give you and this stupid car commercial at the beginning and then pop up videos.  I, I, I, uh, a few weeks ago, I, I, I was like looking up all these Amy Winehouse videos 
[03:38:30]  because I love Amy Winehouse.  Yeah.  And oh my God, like, okay, you, you wait, you finally skip the ad after you've watched  the first 10 seconds and then all these pop up things.  So I got to keep clicking it.  And it's like, screw that.  So, I mean, I respect my viewer, listener, fan enough to not, uh, and I hope that people  appreciate that, not to be, uh, bombarded with this crap. 
[03:39:00]  I know, but don't you buy my fricking CD, my special and see me live.  When do you give back?  Right.  Exactly.  How many grapes are you going to eat before you buy a bunch?  Right.  I mean, if you've been eating free grapes at the supermarket for 10 years,  once in a while, drop the dollar 50, buy the bunch.  But don't you feel like it's, or not, don't you feel, do you think that the internet can 
[03:39:30]  exist as this place where cool stuff is shared for free?  Or do you feel that eventually it's going to be co-opted and become just part of a capitalist  structure?  Everything will be swallowed by capitalism and that's the nature of the planet.  We can't fight that.  But, uh, uh, a different question someone asked me once, how do you feel that you've got so  much of your material on the internet? 
[03:40:00]  Do you think that that would discourage people from seeing you live?  And my thought on that is, you know what?  There is tons of pornography on the internet, uh, and it doesn't stop people from having  sex because there is nothing that will ever replace the live doing it in person aspect  of standup comedy.  Right.  So yeah, you can watch a three minute clip on, on, on YouTube, uh, but if that makes 
[03:40:30]  you not go see comedy, you're not a comedy lover.  That's right.  You're a moron.  You just, you just had a wank, pulled your pants up and went back to working on your car  in the garage.  Right.  That's not the guy I want at my show.  Right.  You know, the casual comedy consumer.  Right.  Exactly.  Oh, I know what that guy's about.  I saw his clip on Peru.  Right.  You don't know him.  And just so our listeners are clear, especially for a Tom Rhodes, you go and buy your DVD,  your last one that was out.  I, by the time that even came out, you're already talking about a whole bunch of other 
[03:41:00]  stuff.  There's, that's the great thing about you and your act is that it's very much in the moment,  very much.  It's very, it's, it's always evolving and always, it's always new and fresh.  It's not like.  I'm trying.  And, you know, last year I did a new special.  It's on Netflix now.  It's called Light Sweet Crude.  I love that title.  Well, and then the CD that I put out that has the same, well, my CD is a double CD. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  It's live in Los Angeles and live in Sydney, Australia.  And it's still, you know, the 999 iTunes thing.  There's, there's a lot of different material because it's different countries.  Right.  And then some similar.  Yeah.  Same stuff.  But that's called Colossus of Me.  Nice.  So because I put the CD out and the, and the new special, now I'm trying to come up with  that new hour.  Right.  So I'm, I'm, I'm nightly trying things out.  Yeah.  But you know. 
[03:42:00]  That's the way it's done.  That's the way it's done.  But I also don't think that, I think that there's a real value to, if I come to see you, I'd  want to see some of my favorite things that I saw in Light Sweet Crude.  Yeah.  You know what?  And it always kills me.  Like, um, someone, I'll, I'll meet people after the show and go, oh, I really wish you  to have done the, um, mix the races joke or some old joke that I did.  And I was like, God, I wish you'd have yelled that out.  Right.  I would have been happy to, I have, I have no problem being a dancing monkey. 
[03:42:30]  If you're my fan and you're coming to see me.  Yeah.  You know, some guys are like, oh, I wouldn't do my old material.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  I want to entertain the shit out of people.  No, exactly.  And they want to see it, you know.  As long as we're not recording a special.  Yeah.  And until we're so big that people are digesting your stuff at such a rate where you can't  repeat, people want to see it.  And half the people in the audience haven't even seen you before.  Right.  So why shouldn't they see the best stuff that you have to give?  Right.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that. 
[03:43:00]  Well, earlier you said that you always come back to America because you want to keep  that American comedy muscle.  My muscle.  Yeah.  Is there, even though it's going global, is it kind of like our jazz where there's just  a different level here that you, or is it the perspective of being used?  Well, I mean, it's so different.  I mean, you know, Chicago audiences are different than San Francisco and L.A. is different.  And, you know, Atlanta and New York is different.  Yeah.  But is there a level?  It's different everywhere.  And then even in the same city, it's a different collection of people every night. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  But do you feel like you get stronger when you talk about the muscle?  Is it being in the States?  You know what?  I mean, we have the common reference.  Yeah.  Like when you're in England and, you know, you have English comedians being able to, you  know, the chip shop on Tottenham Court Road.  Right.  And everybody seems to know what the guy's talking about.  Right.  I mean, it's just the advantage of common reference.  Yeah.  Right.  Um, but I never wanted to be forgotten in my own country. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  And I, and I, I, I love the States.  Yeah.  Uh, you know, I never like just left.  Yeah.  I mean, I, I, I, I mean, there's clubs that I've been playing for years.  I've got relationships with the, the owners and, and people have been seeing me for years  and employees and just, it's almost like an extension of my family.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you roll in and they were all happy to see you come back and right.  I mean, I'd like to move up to a higher level, but, um, I, I, I, I, I think a certain intimacy 
[03:44:30]  is lost in big theaters.  Yeah, for sure.  So.  No, absolutely.  No, I wasn't saying it as far as, uh, selling more tickets or being in bigger venues.  I'm saying as far as.  Staying strong.  Like a boxer.  Yeah.  Like when you work at the, when you work.  You gotta be, I mean, if you want to be a heavyweight champion boxer, man, you gotta,  you gotta be sparring every day.  You gotta be round guys that are also killers.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  Exactly.  Right.  Is there a place in going globally that is just too tough that they, that it doesn't 
[03:45:00]  translate?  Hmm.  Like it's.  Ah, I mean, there's just emerging or.  Uh, I mean, there's, nah, there's dead, there's dead nights.  There's dead nights everywhere.  There's dead nights in LA.  Right.  Yeah.  Do you feel like that, uh, these young guys, like if you're in like a Malaysia,  are they really soaking you, uh, soaking up the knowledge from you as much as they.  Yeah.  I mean, they're really into it and I mean, and they study it and they know, they know 
[03:45:30]  the game.  You gotta study the masters.  I tell you who has the disadvantage is the little alternative comedians in the United  States who only played their little hip, little college, kind of adoring alternative  little coffee shop crowd who is going to encourage and laugh at everything they say.  Those guys don't know what's funny because they can't go to a club.  Right.  They can only play little alternative little kind of crowds.  And they're never, they've never, they've never eaten a turd sandwich and they don't  give a, they have, they have no idea that the concept of masters even exists. 
[03:46:00]  Right.  You know, they, they, they, they think they know what comedy is.  Right.  You want to be a comedian?  You got to study the masters.  Yeah.  And you know, yeah.  Chris Rock, George Carlin.  Yeah.  Uh, Pryor's kind of lost his sting a little bit.  When you listen to those old recordings, because he's been copied so many times.  But you and I are old enough to remember when that was new and dangerous.  Huge, huge.  And the still, I think.  You know, new Brian Regan and, you know, Woody Allen.  I mean, masters. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  Of the craft.  They could go anywhere.  Right.  They could go into any room.  They can go into that little alternative room.  That's what I think a comedian should be.  And that's what I've always, you know, because I branched out all over the states.  I, my first goal was I just wanted to headline all the major cities.  Right.  And then after I got to a certain level in the late nineties, I'm living in New York.  Yeah.  I wanted to be able to go.  Like when I lived in, in San Francisco, I would go over to Oakland and play some black clubs.  Right.  Uh, there was a, uh, you know, you got gay crowds, you got Mexican crowds. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  And that's where I think I first had the concept of you got to be able to kill in front of any  group of people.  Right.  Right.  To, to know what's funny.  Yeah, exactly.  There's been, I mean, when you start out, you get that, there's a rude awakening.  We know all of a sudden you walk into a new room and you're like, oh, these people don't  care about this material at all.  Right.  I've got to, I've got to get busy.  Well, and that's the great thing about going to different countries, you know?  I mean, you really have to think quick on your feet.  You lose a certain percentage of material that just doesn't translate. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  Of talking about things in our country.  Yeah, of course.  But then you also gain observations on, on being there.  Is there an advantage?  So, I mean, you're constantly adjusting and fine tuning your race car engine.  Right.  Right.  Is there an advantage to when you, cause you travel so much, is there an outsider perspective  that, that helps you?  Cause I mean, you're always.  That's one of the, I mean, yeah. 
[03:48:00]  Like when you go to Australia or New Zealand or something, I mean.  Yeah.  I, I find people enjoy when a foreigner comments on their.  Right.  As long as you're not, you know, pooping on them.  Right.  When you have like honest, you know, clever observations.  Yeah.  Like when, I remember Eddie Izzard first coming over.  Yeah.  To this day.  And Eddie Izzard, another master.  Yeah, another master.  His early work.  Yeah.  The, the way he would talk about historical events.  Yeah.  I love that he is art for that.  Me too.  And I first saw him when I was making, going over to London. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  So I remember when he came over to the States and I saw his first one man show.  I was living in New York.  I don't know if his first one, like 98 PS one 22.  Yeah.  And I, and he, him talking about New York and his observations.  Yeah.  I loved it.  It was great.  You know, that's.  So now you're that guy going over.  So we all have that advantage.  Yeah.  As long as you've, you're somewhat respectful.  Respectful and smart about it.  If you, if you're shedding.  Right.  If you go to, and you hear English comedians go, you know, every, you know, American comedians 
[03:49:00]  come over and, oh, and it's mind the gap.  Right.  And cigarettes are fags.  Right.  And these, stay away from the obvious.  Right.  Be clever about it.  Don't be an international hack.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  You're married.  How long have you been married?  Two years.  Two years.  And she folds into your global lifestyle.  Was she global also?  Or is this a ship for her?  No, my wife is from Holland and she's a photographer.  Right. 
[03:49:30]  And she travels with me.  I always said, I wish I could find a woman that likes to travel, sleep late and laugh a lot.  And I finally found one.  That's pretty great.  Boy, can she sleep late.  That's a great combination.  But yeah, she's fabulous.  She's from Holland.  Is it different for you traveling with two people rather than one?  Yeah.  I mean, it eats up a lot of the dough. 
[03:50:00]  Right.  Right.  It's, yeah.  I mean, it's a shift.  I've been a lone wolf my whole life.  Right.  So now the tough part is spending 24 hours a day with somebody.  Yeah.  And traveling and being together all the time.  Especially traveling, it's even more intense because it's not like she's at home and goes  off with her friends.  But normal people, they'll go have a job and for eight hours you get a break from your spouse. 
[03:50:30]  Right.  I don't have that.  Right.  But so she's in Holland right now.  She's visiting her mother and she's going to meet me in Rome on Monday.  Oh, that's so great.  I just like speaking sentences like that.  That's my life.  It's so great.  That's what I like about it, too, is that you really...  I'm the phantom.  And you enjoy it.  You know what you're doing and you're really...  I've gotten really good at it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what do you do when you go to Rome?  What is this going to happen in Rome?  What is Tom Rhodes going to do in Rome for two weeks?  Well, we've gone there, this will be the third year in a row, because I don't live anywhere. 
[03:51:00]  Right.  We will rent nice apartments in cities when we have time off.  So last year I did two months in Europe and I did this tour across Switzerland that ended  in Zurich and then we went down to Rome for a week and now we're going over there for a  couple of weeks.  Just absolutely love Rome.  Is it your favorite city?  Is it your favorite city?  Paris was mine and my wife loves Rome, so now it's pretty neck and neck for Paris and 
[03:51:30]  Rome with me.  Yeah.  I'm also a big fan of Sydney, Australia.  Yeah.  Love Sydney.  Yeah.  But Rome, man, you know, to be standing in line to get a gelato ice cream and you're behind  a Franciscan monk with his burlap bag dress on and he's got a rope belt.  You're like, God, what is this guy having?  Pistachio?  I'm having what the monks have. 
[03:52:00]  I'll have pistachio.  Is there a comedy?  Just like that.  Just to go somewhere and pretend like you live there.  And we've done the tourist stuff to death.  My wife and I are both obsessed with Caravaggio, the artist.  Yeah.  So, I mean, I know where all of his paintings are.  I know where he killed a guy in a duel.  Wow.  And just, so just, you know.  That's pretty great.  You know, a few months ago we went to Key West for a couple weeks.  Last year I did gigs in Korea and then, this is last November, and then I did the Jakarta 
[03:52:30]  International Comedy Festival.  They just started a festival.  In Jakarta.  So then after Jakarta, we went to Bali for two weeks and rented a place there.  Oh, man.  So it depends where we are in the world.  Yeah.  And we'll do an inventive little trip somewhere.  What has it done to your head?  It's expanded my horizons.  Yeah.  I mean, it's enlightenment. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  What's better than travel?  Yeah.  And then to be able to afford this life.  Yeah.  And then do it with another person is really nice.  And, you know, I'm a voracious reader.  I'm just, you know, I love history and knowledge.  Yeah.  And just finding out about places and people.  So I think it all feeds the comedy machine.  You've got to keep putting information into your brain computer, and then little everlasting  gobstoppers will pop out of your mouth, hopefully. 
[03:53:30]  That's what I'm looking for.  Right.  The everlasting gobstopper.  Yeah.  Has it changed?  Joke-wise.  Has it changed?  I mean, I'm sure it has.
