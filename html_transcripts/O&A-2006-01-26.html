<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a series of thank yous and a call from Sarah seeking a refund from XM radio for a returned MiFi device.  After some initial confusion, the hosts, with the help of an XM representative, resolved the issue.  Comedian Patrice O'Neal then joined them in studio, prompting discussion of a positive Daily News article about the show and their use of PalTalk for online interaction with listeners.  The hosts and Patrice discussed how the article portrayed them beyond their "shock jock" image.

A significant portion of the show focused on "Stalker Patty," a recurring character who, following a Daily News photographer's departure, performed a bizarre stunt involving nudity, blindfolds, mousetraps, and a search for checks â€“ all for money.  The hosts discussed the incident, listener reactions to the video, and her recent firing from Godiva.  They also promoted their upcoming "American Mess" segment, showcasing unusual individuals, recalling past successes like Big A and Twitchells.  The hosts detailed how they found these individuals, often through chance encounters.

A major segment was dedicated to a feud with Bubba the Love Sponge, featuring audio clips of Bubba's criticisms and the hosts' scathing retorts, filled with insults and accusations of Bubba's lack of originality and sycophancy towards Howard Stern.  They urged their "Pests" (listeners) to continue harassing Bubba.

The show included a graphic phone call from Mike in Chicago, detailing a multi-person sexual encounter, followed by a similarly explicit call from Jamie describing her sexual encounter with two men.  The Bubba feud continued, interspersed with a brief mention of Michael Jackson and a sexual harassment case, and Opie's anecdote about a urinal exploding in the studio bathroom.  Comedian Brian Regan joined the show towards the end, and they discussed Bob Saget's dirty comedy and Regan's career.  This continued into the next segment, which opened with discussion of Regan's comedy routines and audience requests for specific bits, including Richard Pryor and George Carlin impersonations.  A caller, Ryan from D.C., shared his long-standing admiration for Regan.  Regan also talked about his brother Dennis, a writer for *The King of Queens*. Another caller, Terry from Australia, revealed a long-running family prank involving a fictional older brother.

A call from "My Big Cans" led to sexually suggestive comments about her breasts and tattoo.  The hosts played "Guess What's in My Pants," a game involving a female caller describing her pubic hair via sounds made by rubbing the phone on her genitals. Brian Regan initially refused but later participated.  The show revisited "Stalker Patty's" mousetrap stunt, leading the hosts and Regan to get their hands caught in mousetraps.  Further calls followed, including an audio clip of a man having sex with a chicken and a midget sighting.  A Paltalk video of a woman deep-throating a banana was also mentioned.

The next segment started with a caller describing a video of a person with long arms and ill-fitting pants.  Discussions of listener-submitted Paltalk videos followed, including one of a man driving while using a webcam and another showing a woman in sexually explicit acts.  Anita, a 60-year-old trucker, called, describing the show as a "train wreck." Other calls included listener complaints about Regan's shows (including a stabbing and a child being run over, both presented humorously), a discussion of Patrice O'Neal's website bandwidth issues, and praise for the show's humor.

A significant portion centered on Matt, who agreed to put a mousetrap on his testicles live on air for Brian Regan tickets.  The hosts and Regan provided detailed, graphic instructions and commentary.  After the event, Matt described the experience.  Discussions about an alleged sexual harassment case involving Isaiah Thomas and a Jim Cook impersonation were included.  Blind Dave, a frequent caller and musician, called in.  The segment ended with the hosts sending Regan to his next engagement.

The final segment heavily focused on Matt's mousetrap incident, with callers reacting with shock, disgust, and laughter.  The event was compared to other painful scenarios.  The hosts offered Matt Brian Regan tickets.  The audio recording of Matt's experience was played repeatedly.  The hosts promoted their "American Mess" show, and Rob unexpectedly appeared outside the studio, engaging in a bizarre interaction before leaving.  The show ended with further discussion of the mousetrap incident, promotion of the show's website, and a "What Did We Learn?" segment.  Patrice O'Neal was a guest during this segment as well.

[00:07:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What do we need to do?  You've got to give me a Wi-Fi or something.  Well, I know customer service was out of their minds because of the Christmas rush.  Yeah, very busy.  We signed up a lot of subscribers and all that.  We got a lot of new XM listeners.  Maybe things are calming down enough where you could... 
[00:07:30]  I don't understand why they owe her money.  Yeah.  They won't give it back to me.  They will not give it back to me.  Why do they owe you money?  They said because they're backed up.  No, look, lady, lady, listen to me for a second.  Jesus Christ.  Practice with us.  We'll help you.  Let's say I called you up and said, your husband, boyfriend, whatever, didn't give me $150.  And wouldn't you ask, well, what does he owe you that for?  And I would say, well, he hasn't given it to me. 
[00:08:00]  And wouldn't that sound ridiculous?  Wouldn't you want me to give you a reason why he owed me the money?  I want to know why you are owed this money from XM.  I have bought a MiFi and I returned it and they won't give it back to me.  They won't give me the money back.  Where did you buy it?  I bought it online and I mailed it right back to them.  All right.  No, they knew I was mailing it back to them.  She bought it online and it was from XM. 
[00:08:30]  Uh-huh.  Straight from XM online.  And I called them and said, listen, I want to return it because we were buying a better  one from an actual store.  And they said, okay, fine.  And they gave me some kind of authorization number to return it.  So I returned it.  And now they're out of their minds.  They have no idea what's going on.  The check is in the mail.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Eric Logan is personally going to take care of you today.  Yes.  All right. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you, guys.  This is the only one we're doing today, though.  Please.  Yeah.  We're not customer service here.  Yeah.  Let us know when it's taken care of.  All right, Sarah?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I love you.  Don't cancel your XM.  I won't.  All right.  There goes Sarah.  All right.  She's a little thick-headed.  Get her information.  And she was a little thick-headed there.  It was very hard to get through and get the answer as to why she was owed this money.  Actually, send it to Don Wicklund.  He'll take care of Sarah from New York.  Okay?  Yeah.  And now everyone else is calling with their little problems. 
[00:09:30]  We don't want to solve problems today.  We've got a radio show to do.  We've got a big radio show to do today.  We've got Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Good morning.  Patrice shouldn't even be here.  He should be in his car driving to Philly.  He's got a big comedy show tonight.  He does?  I didn't hear anything about that.  I would have been still asleep, man.  About 5 o'clock ahead of the day.  Yeah.  And then I'm hearing that he's coming all the way back from Philly tomorrow just to do our radio show.  I'm a trooper.  Wow.  So show him some love at Helium tonight. 
[00:10:00]  I can't believe I just said show him some love.  Ugh.  Where are you?  I ain't thinking nothing.  That's a hacky thing to say.  Show him some love.  That's introing at the Apollo.  Yeah, really?  Show him some love, people.  O'Blazer thinks he's groundbreaking in hypniss.  Yeah.  Show him some love, baby.  I try.  Give him a little eye dazzle, baby.  Just make it up.  And it's a very happy day for the Opie and Anthony program.  We've got a nice big feature in the Daily News today.  Yes. 
[00:10:30]  Kind of a positive piece, too.  We had David Hinckley from the Daily News come in a couple days ago and interviewed us after the show.  I guess a lot of people saw the interview through Pal Talk, right?  Yep.  We're doing all sorts of crazy things with this Pal Talk.  Unfortunately, Pal Talk, the server is down right now.  Oh, okay.  So we're not on until they bring the servers back up.  But right when they do, we'll log on.  Well, it's kind of fun for the hardcore listeners.  We turn on the cameras in the office and you could watch us just eating food and reading newspapers for an hour straight. 
[00:11:00]  They commented on Patrice eating and Patrice's hat.  They were commenting on that this morning.  What's Opie eating?  Some people were making jokes that it was some form of tree bark and leaves.  It was just oatmeal and blueberries today.  Blueberries.  And we just sit around, read the papers, eat, and people enjoy this.  Apparently so.  They notice we don't talk to each other much because we're just getting our heads together.  Yeah, we watch the TV.  And then they slowly watch the office empty and then the broadcast begins. 
[00:11:30]  And the studio camera comes up.  So anyway, the Daily News did a very positive article on your pals Opie and Anthony today.  Opie and Anthony's not so dirty little secret.  What does that mean?  Well, basically that, you know, he's admitting that we're more than just the shock jock crap.  We are.  We're more than just saying all those dirty words.  Isn't that nice?  I'm surprised.  David Hinkley, I think he's warming up to us finally. 
[00:12:00]  Finally.  He realizes we're not going anywhere.  Yeah.  We've been part of New York radio.  Well, now, you know, all over the country.  But especially New York radio for, what, we're up to like seven, eight years now.  Yeah.  And he's finally, like, giving us props and respect.  That we're here and we're really not going anywhere.  We're not going to be leaving.  Instead of boring you with the entire article, I don't know, read it online, I guess, if you're somewhere else in the country.  I'm sure whackbag.com will have a link to the article and opianthony.com will have it. 
[00:12:30]  But it's nice.  We're noticing lately that slowly but surely we're starting to get into the press again.  Getting a little action here, a little action there.  It's starting to grow again.  It's kind of nice to see.  Well, the listeners are coming on board.  That's a big part of it.  Another part of it is a lot of the people in the news want to talk about the fact that, and this article mentions it,  the fact that we've been on satellite radio now for well over a year.  Right.  We're up to, what, a year and four months almost now?  A year and four months. 
[00:13:00]  We've been here doing great, and, you know, you want to look at how satellite radio works  and how a show from terrestrial radio that, you know, is at the top of their game comes over to satellite and also succeeds.  Now they're coming to us for that story.  That's it.  That's what he did.  There you go.  And a fine picture of us.  Jesus.  Wonderful.  Can you get the camera any closer to my face?  She was snapping those pictures. 
[00:13:30]  We look too happy.  Yeah.  This is a picture they took, us looking very happy.  We're laughing.  We're having a good time.  Little did the photographer know, as soon as she left the studio that day, we had a 50-year-old woman,  completely naked, blindfolded, crawling around the floor, searching for checks that were among a lot of mousetraps.  They would have got a much different photo.  Oh, yeah.  For their fine article on us.  I think that headline would have been a little different. 
[00:14:00]  And you know what?  This is the brilliance of us.  And when I say brilliance and that we're brilliant broadcasters and all that, I hope you realize that we're fucking around with that.  But I'll show you the brilliance of us here, okay?  We knew that that photographer was here, so we were all happy.  Yep.  That's the image we wanted to throw out there because every time she was snapping, we were smiling.  Right.  We want to keep them guessing.  So she's snapping away, and we're just smiling and laughing like what's going on in the studio was the funniest stuff we've ever heard in our lives. 
[00:14:30]  We were just playing good boys.  As soon as she left, it's like, is she gone?  Yes.  All right.  Pull down the drapes.  It's time to bring in Stalker Patty.  Bring in Patty and the mousetraps.  We waited and waited and waited until she left.  I had to rationalize all day that day when I was here.  Yeah.  I had to just rationalize like, you know how you just try to say, okay, God, here's how I'm going to make myself feel better about that situation. 
[00:15:00]  And two things.  One, Stalker Patty was into it.  She's a masochist.  You know what's weird about her?  We got her to that point.  She was scared in the beginning to show anything, to do anything.  Now she'll do just about anything we ask her.  I told my girl about it.  She goes, I'd have been a homeless bitch.  Yeah.  And that ended the whole conversation.  I said, you know, I was like, oh, man, I don't know, man.  That's $2,000.  I'd have been a homeless bitch.  I was like, well, there you go, Patty. 
[00:15:30]  $2,000 to be humiliated for five minutes, ten minutes.  Two G's.  Two G's.  There are hookers that get two grand, and, you know, it's an hour.  And there's a cum shot, and, you know, a lot more degradation than that.  There's choices.  Choices?  She's made some.  It's choices.  I didn't feel, I felt bad for like a second, like, oh, because, you know, her little wrinkly body.  Oh, E.T.  Awful, and, you know, she's crawling around.  But I'm like, it was so disingenuous. 
[00:16:00]  Her little, oh, she just stuck on, she was holding hands.  She was looking for the mousetrap.  She knows the deal.  She sounded like a chimp.  She knows American mess is coming up, and she doesn't want to go.  She wants to fucking be on the hall of, the mess hall of fame.  We've given her thousands of dollars over the years.  Yeah.  And what with Stalker Patty?  She'd still be Stalker Patty without a job.  Yeah.  And if you guys didn't have a radio, to have her crawl around and degrade herself.  She'd be a homeless bitch.  She'd just be homeless, crawling around.  Homeless. 
[00:16:30]  So you would just pass her on the streets in New York City, sitting there.  And crawling around and mouth shit.  Yeah.  And mouth shit.  And some garbage bag with a cup in her hand.  Get like, got no home.  You know, it's like, you know, what are you going to do, dude?  I mean, it was intense.  It was great.  The video is up.  It's getting downloaded like no video has been downloaded lately.  Oh, God almighty.  The video of her just crawling around naked, blindfolded, searching around for the checks  among the mousetraps.  Priceless. 
[00:17:00]  She's fine.  She's fine now.  She's fucking fine.  And that little fucking trickster.  She's getting welfare and fucking social security.  Oh, yeah.  She's working the system.  Get out of here.  She's not retarded.  She's just got a speech impediment.  You know what?  What I found that really disturbed me, though, is the fact that Godiva canceled her.  Jesus.  Canceled her.  I'm going to be canceled instead of fired.  Godiva fired her.  Yep.  She was like the perfect employee.  Would show up early, leave late.  Yeah.  Would do whatever they say. 
[00:17:30]  And they fired her ass.  But she's uncomfortable.  You know, she says some chick fire.  So was some uncomfortable corporate woman that probably set her up.  Yeah.  Probably dumped her extra sugar in the thing and said, oh, there was a fucking diabetic  scare at the street and it was your fault.  We're going to have to let you go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know it's weird.  She's so not corporate.  Someone goes, you felt sorry for Stalker Patty.  I'm like, I did not.  I hate the bitch.  And then I'm like, all right, maybe a little.  A little bit.  I kind of felt sorry for her because she would come in here with her Godiva chocolate. 
[00:18:00]  She was proud of her job.  Very proud to work there.  She was like winning employee of the month and all that stuff.  She was so into the job, so proud of it.  And they just like threw her out with the garbage.  She took her way out of that job, dude.  It's like, you can't be.  I went into Godiva chocolate once, grab a couple of, grab a $55 four box, four candy  box set.  It was four pieces of candy.  It was $13.99 or whatever.  I go in there and, you know, I buy shit like that.  I make sure the fucking price is still on the thing when I give it to my bitch. 
[00:18:30]  It's just like, oh, that's still on there?  You pull it off.  Oh, shit, $60.  You pay $16.99?  Oh, you know, baby.  They left a price tag on that?  What am I?  Nothing.  Nothing.  For you.  Make that bitch eat.  And, you know, they said the best way to enjoy this is make sure you chew each candy  36 times for your swallow.  That's really funny.  So, you know, she was getting, you know, they got those little kids and, you know,  Stark, Patty's 50 and the kids they haven't worked in. 
[00:19:00]  And it's like they had 12 and 13 and they just creeped out by her creepiness.  It's an harder job.  She had to go.  She's an assembly line bitch.  She needs to move to Iowa and, like, put together toilet paper rolls, you know.  Once again, though, if you want to see the video, it's up on opanthony.com before calling  around.  And tomorrow is a big day for the show, hopefully.  We're not feeling a buzz about tomorrow, though.  I'm a little nervous.  We have an open call.  It's called American Mess.  We're looking for the next generation of freaks for this radio show.  Yep.  We've been very successful.  We found Pat from Menachie, borderline freak. 
[00:19:30]  He's a mess.  He's a mess.  He's not as bad as some of the people that we've had come through that door.  Half a Hulk face we have found.  Who is a complete mess.  Big A.  Those are huge finds.  But do you remember the origin of each one of your messes?  This is the problem with American Mess.  Did they just show up and say, I'm a mess, or was they brought to you on a platter?  They were brought in for the most part, yeah.  Not really.  Big A was hanging out on the sidewalk when we were doing a motorcycle rally to Philly. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  And he was just out there to check it out.  And we had Danny go down there to interview people that were just hanging out on the street.  And, you know, he started talking.  We're like, wow, get up here immediately.  And he became a star like that.  And Twitchells just came with the guys from that movie, Christmas Story, I think it was.  Right, right.  Yeah.  He was just hanging out with one of the guys from Christmas Story that came in to do an interview.  And all of a sudden, you know, we saw him twitching away.  We're like, oh, my God, we've got to get him in. 
[00:20:30]  He didn't come here to go on the radio at all.  He was just a friend of somebody.  Dumb luck.  It was just dumb luck.  Right.  So we'll see.  It's American Mess tomorrow.  And Patty was working for that charity organization.  Right.  Remember that one?  Right.  That World Hunger year thing that they did every year at WNEW.  She was working for them, like, taking phone calls for pledges.  She was a volunteer.  Volunteer.  And she was in the studio, and that's how we found her. 
[00:21:00]  And she started bringing cookies by and wouldn't leave us alone.  And then when I was still commuting to Long Island, next thing you know, you've got to fast forward a bit.  But she started ending up on my trains and stuff.  I'm like, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  Go home.  Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty.  Oh, yeah.  There's a reason why we called her Stalker Patty.  Here's the phone calls really quick of us discovering Big A.  It just happens like this sometimes.  Listen to this.  You going on the ride today?  Actually, I just came down here to take some photos of everybody and to post on whackbag.com. 
[00:21:30]  How come you're not going on the ride?  I didn't plan it.  What up?  It's not too late.  Tag along.  I don't know who I could, you know, tag along or not, but I was just hanging out.  So that was the origin of Big A. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, that's it right there.  Danny was just talking to listeners down on the street.  We're like, oh, my God, get him up here.  What is that guy's deal?  What is that guy's deal?  And the rest is history.  And the rest is fucking history.  I had to get him up here.  So tomorrow you can be an instant star.  You never know.  It's an open call for American messes.  If you've got a speech impediment, you're missing a body part, you've got an unusual talent,  we'll take you all starting tomorrow.  Come on up.  And I think Big A has the, I've never heard of, I don't, you know, it's such a mysterious disease. 
[00:22:30]  I've never heard anything like that.  It's not stuttering.  It's not stammering.  It's just a, it's a singing.  That's a guy that's scared of his own freaking shadows, they say.  But, like, I think he has one of those snapping points where he just, like, snaps and breaks  children's necks.  Oh, he's killing somebody.  Big A has killed.  Let's go to Mike in Chicago.  Mike, what's going on today?  Yeah, I just wanted, A-O-P-A, buddies. 
[00:23:00]  I just wanted to see if you heard that, the sound from Bubba's show yesterday.  It was enough to piss me off.  That piece of shit.  I guess the pest sent in audio of Bubba going after us yesterday.  Yeah, I hope he got all 20 minutes, because he wants to fight now, I guess.  Yeah, it looks like we got under Todd's skin.  It didn't take much at all, because he knows the reality that the only reason he's got a  job is because he had to lick Howard Stern's ass. 
[00:23:30]  And because there was no other shock jock available for Howie to fill up his two channels with.  It came all of a sudden.  It's kind of like Howard might have passed it down to him to start shit or something.  The guy had no opportunities for employment, is what happened.  Howard would have loved to have had more talented shows.  How about any other shows on his channels?  It's Howard, and he's got two channels he's got to fill up.  And all he's been able to come up with is Bubba, because Bubba was the only guy available, 
[00:24:00]  because he was out of work.  We know we were in that boat when we fucked up.  The trouble is, and the difference is, we had job offers coming in.  We just couldn't take them, because we were under contract.  Not like Bubba.  They were bragging Benaduce or whatever that retard's name is now, next week or something.  I have no idea.  But we got under his skin there.  I mean, the truth hurts.  You know, the guy used to fight the good fight. 
[00:24:30]  He hated Howard Stern.  He was going after Howard on a daily basis.  And then he had no choice.  He had to, like, play into Howard Stern's ego to get a fucking job in radio.  How do you even look at yourself in the mirror?  You had to lick Howard's ass, and now you have to call him your boss.  Anthony and I will never call anyone our boss.  Hey, the boss.  Oh, fuck, no.  We're the bosses.  And we're proud of that.  He's like this idiot.  He's got every fucking parody I heard had all the bleeps from, like, three years ago when he had it on his radio show. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, another guy not.  Every fucking one of them.  Another guy just taking all his stuff over from commercial radio, thinking that's going to get the job done.  What was it?  Three, two, three years ago.  Fucking lazy shit.  Lazy shit.  Mike from Chicago brings up a good point, but he is the most annoying caller to talk to on the phone.  Mike.  Oh, he's a little excited.  Mike, you're very excited.  And as we're talking, you're just babbling.  Look, see?  See?  See?  As we're talking, you are just babbling underneath what we're saying. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  Did you notice that at all?  Yeah, sorry.  You did?  I just want to point it out so that next time, when you call, it doesn't happen again.  Right.  Okay.  The O&A Pests are doing a great job with Bob with a love sponge.  Yeah.  And also, you're American mess.  Yeah.  We're supposed to get Neil from Paltech.  I want to get my vote in.  All right.  He's a mess from Arizona.  Is he coming in?  He's supposed to be.  He's supposed to be getting in there in town 5 o'clock tonight, I guess. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, wow.  All right.  We'll be looking for him.  Yeah, we want to hear from other people that are showing up tomorrow, because we're a little  nervous about the whole American mess thing.  All right.  Doug out, Doug knows him, so he'll be calling.  Oh, well, then.  Well, thanks to Doug out, Doug, and the rest of the O&A Pests for making Bob with a love  sponge life a living fucking hell.  All right.  And by the way, to Bob with a love sponge, because he's listening every day, they have  XM at the Sirius offices.  One of our old bosses listens to us every fucking day. 
[00:26:30]  To Bob with a love sponge, we're not going to start a battle with you.  Our battle's with your boss.  With the man in the relationship.  We're not going to fight the bitch.  We're going to fight the boss.  Your boss.  Why would you go and take on the guy's bitch?  You know?  She could be talking shit.  My man's better than you.  My man will kick your ass.  That's all fine and well.  But you never go to the bitch in the relationship.  And that's you, Bubba. 
[00:27:00]  You're the bitch.  And you show it every day.  Do you think anyone looks at you with any type of respect when every single day you're  praising Howard Stern and just licking his asshole like that?  It's embarrassing.  It is fucking embarrassing to listen to you do that.  Have some pride, man.  After Howard bashed you, bashed the shit out of you on the air for so many years, you  just turn around and because he gave you a job, you lick his ass, all is forgiven, you 
[00:27:30]  lost any credibility you might have had.  And you have zero respect in the business with fans.  You think anyone wants to hear anybody drool over that fucking guy's ass like you have  been?  I mean, it's embarrassing.  And he's challenging us to a hacky radio fight.  We don't do hacky radio bits, fuckface.  We're not doing the fight thing.  I'll meet you in an octagon. 
[00:28:00]  Really?  Are you going to get sponsorships?  I'll meet you in an octagon anytime, anyplace.  Shut up.  With my stack of dimes neck and, what, hose arms?  Garden hose arms?  Yeah.  Garden hose arms.  You know what?  That's like college radio, like, put downs.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I'm not as big and badass as you, man.  Do you think I care?  Do you think I care that I'm not as fat as Bubba the Love Sponge? 
[00:28:30]  And his timing stinks because he's like, no one gives a shit about Opie and Anthony on  XM Satellite Radio.  As we have a huge article in the New York Daily News today.  Yeah, New York Daily News.  Our show sucks, but we got a quote from Bubba praising our show, and it would be a great radio  station if he was on the same fucking station as us.  Yeah.  He's a fraud just like his boss.  Bubba, you're not even in blurbs.  You don't even get into blurbs in the news.  Every story is about Howard, and you're delusional to think that you're tied into that whole thing. 
[00:29:00]  You ever see a guy, they're called hangers-on, and they want to be part of something so badly  that they almost believe they're attached to that thing?  That's how he is with Howard.  Howard, it was huge news.  He's leaving Terrestrial Radio.  He went over to Satellite.  That was big news.  Yeah, it was on all the talk shows and the newspapers.  The guy had been in radio for decades, carved out a huge legacy in the business. 
[00:29:30]  We're not blind.  We saw what happened.  We're not going to sit here and say Howard wasn't successful in radio.  You have to be stupid.  And Howard got more headlines than us because he's been at it about 15 years more than us.  It's the way it is.  But we do just fine with the headlines and the press.  But, Bubba, that isn't you.  It's not going to be you.  No matter how much you hang on, latch on to Howard's cock, it isn't you they're talking about. 
[00:30:00]  They're not talking about Howard and Bubba over at Sirius.  They're talking about Howard.  He's your fucking boss.  You admit it.  You admit it.  And you lap his ass, nuts, and cock on a daily basis.  You ought to play into his big, fat ego to get a radio job.  You know how much he enjoyed that?  What did he lap his asshole, his taint, his ball sack, and his cock.  And then repeat over and over every day. 
[00:30:30]  So keep admitting that Howard's your boss.  Are you going to be hanging out with Howard?  I don't think so.  Yeah, I don't see the hang with Howard.  Do you think he finds you a friend?  He said he doesn't want to be in the same room with a Bubba the Love Sponge.  He doesn't want to work in the same industry.  He was forced.  I know the truth hurts.  He was forced to hire you to fill a fucking channel up with something. 
[00:31:00]  He had 14 months and he couldn't find one other show.  You were it because you were sitting on a curb.  You were in the fucking radio gutter after you were thrown off the air.  That's what happened to you.  Clear Channel wasn't paying you.  Infinity?  Paying us.  They didn't want us going anywhere else.  You know why?  Proven in the business, dickface.  Everyone likes to make fun of us.  Had ratings.  Because we blew up our careers. 
[00:31:30]  We never missed a paycheck.  Never missed a paycheck and had a job right away.  He's trying to claim after this contract we're fucked.  XM won't re-sign us and we have no place to go.  Well, if that's the case, I'll have enough money to retire and I'm done.  Who cares?  I don't give a shit.  That's it.  I'm not that desperate for a job where I'm going to go lick someone's ass to get it.  We had a job the second we were allowed to have a job from Infinity.  What did you do, Bubba?  You sat there until Howard Stern, so desperate to fill up two channels, hired you. 
[00:32:00]  And for what you were hired for, I don't think you should talk about anyone else's paycheck there, Bubba.  And stop saying that we're making $70,000 a year.  We make $75,000 a year.  Yeah, at least be honest.  I love the exaggeration that these assholes go with.  Oh, and then they make $70,000 a year.  Jesus.  Do we, Bubba?  Do we? 
[00:32:30]  Or is it really you making $70,000 a year?  Again, you know, I hate to have to address the bitch.  So we'll have fun with you from time to time, but this is a job for our O&A pest.  Yeah.  Because we're taking on your boss.  We're not taking on the little bitch that admits that he has a boss and then he had to lick the boss's ass to get the job.  And he smooches it every day.  He's still, not to get the job, he's still, any time the pests send a clip, he is praising and sucking that Howard Stern cock. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, have some fucking respect.  The tiny Jewish nub.  Oh.  Enjoy it.  You watch what the pests can do.  It's a job for the pests.  We can't be bothered with you.  And we're not going to do a cute little radio fight.  And you know how many more listeners we have than you?  Do you even fucking know?  It's not even an issue.  We have more than your boss, Howard.  We have more listeners than your stupid fucking boss, Howard. 
[00:33:30]  Howard, and you're not even a part of that.  Not even a player in that whole scenario, that whole Howard Stern scenario.  You're not even fucking mentioned.  To the ONA pest, attack and have fun.  Have fun.  Have fun.  Make sure you call him Todd a lot.  Make sure you mention that he had his stomach stapled and he still weighs close to 300 pounds.  Yeah.  How do you feel so many calories in a fucking stomach the size of a chain? 
[00:34:00]  Orange purse.  Still got to eat.  No holes bogged.  What are you eating for there, Bubba?  What's the food covering up?  That's why his prostate was slightly swollen.  God damn.  Motherfucker.  Stomach stapled.  He still weighs 300 pounds.  Reporting his health conditions.  That's brilliant.  You better fire your fucking doctor.  Yeah.  Anyway, a little song parody came in because he loves song parodies over there.  Apparently, that's a staple of the program, according to The Pests. 
[00:34:30]  I think Ryan put this together.  Look who our boss is, and look who we've befriended.  I don't want to be in an industry with a Bubba the Love Sponge.  Don't, Fred.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Blink Howard's ass and be thankful you got a job.  Fucking fat fuck.  Yo, he's fat and lazy.  Half retarded and crazy.  Got his fucking stomach stapled and he's still overweight.  Bubba the Love Sponge, can you soak this up?  You belong on VH1's Celebrity Fit Club.  Only you're not famous.  You're just fat. 
[00:35:00]  Spring break, 98.  Wants his hairdo back.  Every time he opens his mouth, he just keeps sucking.  One more hole for Howard's little dick to just keep fucking.  I'm a redneck with a lame perspective named after a motherfucking female contraception.  Well, you should call yourself Bubba the Love Deuce  because you look like stinky pussy and you smell like one, too.  Well, don't cry, Bubba.  Tell Daddy Howard what's wrong.  I made a lame parody of your lame parody song.  You're playing a knife to a rapier fight.  You just might earn the wrath of evil opium.  It'll be good night.  You have no fucking idea. 
[00:35:30]  I'm a black ninja.  Fuck face.  Fuck face.  Fuck face.  Fuck face.  Fuck face.  Fuck face.  You are ridiculous.  I always got to throw something racial in there.  It's like saying a black ninja is just being redundant, but you might say.  No, man, because you get the skills of a ninja and the skills of the black man.  Right.  I'm smart.  You're like Blade.  You get the skills of the black man and the vampire.  That's right.  I'm giving the black man respect. 
[00:36:00]  He has better fighting skills.  If you're just a ninja, that's pretty cool, but a black ninja?  Fuck yeah.  Now you're kicking the ass.  I'm a porch monk.  You really shouldn't pick fights, buddy.  You have no idea.  You have no fucking idea.  I'll just tell you that much.  I'll just tell you that much.  You really should just shut up now.  Stop it.  Just shut up now and enjoy the pest. 
[00:36:30]  It's going to be a living hell.  There's a reason why Howard doesn't take on this fight with us.  There's a reason.  He knows he can't win this fight.  Talk to your pal, your buddy, the guy you befriended.  Oh.  You know what he is?  He's the cartoon where that little dog is jumping around the big dog.  What do you want to do next?  Hey, Spike, what do we do now?  Shit.  You think Howard befriended you, Bubba?  You're just, he's just paying you to fill some air time until something more talented comes along. 
[00:37:00]  Good luck.  Have fun.  Let's go to Dead Bent and Jam.  Jamie, I think her name is.  You don't know her name?  What's up, boys?  Yeah, I just met her tonight.  How's it going, guys?  All right, why don't you explain what's going on here?  Uh, my buddy stopped by with a lady friend of his, and, uh, you know, she's a very personable young lady. 
[00:37:30]  Hello.  We're just listening.  You've got to explain what's going on there in Chicago.  He's either, uh, on the treadmill or...  I got this fine lady right on top of me, and she's working, working my, my meat here.  And she's, uh, pretty hot.  Are you banging her, or is she, uh, giving you a head?  Uh, I'm banging right now.  Oh, you're banging.  Yeah.  Let me get my buddy in here, and he could, uh, she could help out, too.  Ugh.  Ugh. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, we're not big fans of the buddy thing.  Hey.  Every time we talk about this, man, like Anthony and I are in the minority, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, because, uh, people have no problem, you know, having sex with their friend, uh, nearby.  This is the first time for me, sir, but I think I'll just keep it.  Well, we'd rather hear the girl, obviously.  What's the, uh, phone, uh, charges from, uh, Brokeback Mountain?  Oh, man.  Here, let me give, let me give the phone to this lady, all right?  All right.  All right, guys.  Hey, guys.  Hey, who are you?  I'm Jamie. 
[00:38:30]  And, uh, how do you know these guys?  I met him at the club tonight.  I met his boy Alfredo at the club tonight.  You met Alfredo at the club tonight, and now you, you figured, uh, Alfredo took you over  there and you would just fuck all the guys?  Yeah, pretty much.  Wow, you're a...  I was hoping for girls, but...  A goer.  ...but, you know...  Oh, you wanted some girls in there, too?  I wanted girls, but...  Are they putting you, are they putting you on the rotisserie? 
[00:39:00]  The rotisserie?  Yeah, that's where one guy's banging you from behind, and, uh, the other guy's, uh,  getting a blowjob.  It's also called finger cuffs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We already done all that.  Yeah?  Also a tuna sandwich.  Tuna sandwich?  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Hey, boys.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'd like to send a shout-out to all my fine friends on whackbag.com in the listening thread  this morning.  Hurra, go boys.  And, uh, here goes Jamie.  Okay.  All right.  Well, we want to hear Jamie for a little while.  Jamie.  Hey. 
[00:39:30]  Hey.  What do you look like, Jamie?  This is radio.  Blonde hair, blue eyes.  I would describe myself as an hourglass figure.  Ah, so you're kind of a full-figured gal?  No, no, no.  Not like that.  No.  How much away?  How tall are you?  I'm 5'5".  I weigh 132.  I got a Coke bottle figure.  Coke bottle?  I thought you said hourglass.  I'm definitely, I'm definitely not.  I got a fucking bottle of Galiano figure. 
[00:40:00]  I'm definitely not fake, so.  All right.  What kind of, what kind of boobs you got there, Jamie?  I got a B cup.  Like a what?  A 24 weight?  And how tall, how tall are you?  Um, how old are you?  I am going to be 20 on Saturday.  So she's 19.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Hot.  Uh-huh.  Although I said that, that makes it extra hot.  And Mike says it's extra hot.  Well, the fact that you're still a teen is very hot and you're getting gangbored. 
[00:40:30]  Not on, not on Saturday.  And Saturday, my birthday present is as hot as Mexican girl named Carmen.  Oh, really?  That's your birthday present?  Hell yes.  She says I can hit that on Saturday.  Wow, you're just a little slut there, huh?  No, no, no.  I didn't like that.  Well, you, uh, Patrice has just, uh, drawn a picture of your hourglass figure.  And, uh, well, I lost my boner. 
[00:41:00]  Apparently, from your description, your ass is a little big, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so you got a little bit of an ass on you.  Furby and white, yeah.  What are those glasses that, like, they go straight down and then it's bulbous at the bottom?  A bong.  Yeah, yeah, she has a bong figure.  She's got a bong figure.  That's even better.  A yard of beer.  I was thinking a yard of beer, maybe, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And you don't know these guys at all?  You saw them at the club, got drunk, and said, what the hell?  Yep, yep, yep.  What made you, uh, what was the guy's line that clinched the deal? 
[00:41:30]  If there was?  How did the guy clinch the deal with taking you home?  What, did he just say, hey, you want to go home and fuck, or?  No, no, no.  We were supposed to go to a club.  Yeah, you were in the club, but what did he do to get you out of there and get you home?  We were supposed to go to another club.  Oh.  We were trying, getting crazy, but, uh, we ended up, uh, Martin bought a...  Let me see.  She is wasted.  Here, hold on.  Now they're fighting over. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, yo, what's up?  Who's this?  What are you guys fighting over?  Nah, this girl's fucking got a mouth like a hoover.  So, I mean, it's kind of fucking hard over here in the shot.  Who's this?  Uh, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, what's up, man?  This is Alfredo on the shot.  You got to represent, you know, right quick, say what's up to my boys.  You guys want to come through to the shot.  This girl's a party animal, straight up.  Yeah, so you guys are just banging her?  Dude, we fucking got wired.  Getting crunked.  A few bottles.  Came by the neighborhood.  This girl's a freak, man. 
[00:42:30]  Where are you guys located?  New York City.  Oh, shit, New York.  That's good.  That's good.  Well, you got the whole country listening to you right now.  You guys want to show the country what you can do or what?  Yeah, give this chick a good slamming.  Hey, Papa, that's love.  Hey, you know what?  If you were here, you'd see what I'm seeing and you'd fall in love.  Trust me.  Blue eyes.  This girl's got a mask like a black girl.  Mask like a black girl.  Patrice knows.  We knew.  Patrice knows.  All right, give her the phone and start fucking. 
[00:43:00]  Give her the phone and start fucking?  Yeah.  Again?  Yeah.  Dude, I'm smoking a Newport right now.  Oh, you're done?  Hey, hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Hey, gentlemen.  Yeah.  Is everyone done over there?  Yeah, I'm pretty much getting out of there and going to hose myself off.  So, I look like Tyler Durden in Fight Club.  So, I don't know, boys.  I hope this provided at least a little bit of filler for everybody today and damn shit's 
[00:43:30]  knocking over and I got to get going.  I'm punching out, guys.  All right.  If you guys get to go a second round, give us a call.  Yeah, you guys talk later.  All right.  That was very disappointing, actually.  I think we went to him too late.  Yep, too late.  Had a whore in there and nothing.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program.  We got lots to do today.  We got Michael Jackson dressing like an Arab now.  We got to get into the Isaiah Thomas thing that's happening here in New York. 
[00:44:00]  Holy crap.  Sexual harassment bullshit again on the front page of all the papers.  That's an unbelievable story.  And much, much, much, much, much more to get to here.  So, stay there.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  He's playing the Helium Comedy Club in Philly tonight.  Make sure you go down there and check out Patrice if you're in the area, okay?  Right. 
[00:44:30]  I just blew up a urinal.  Yeah, what happened?  I was taking a leek.  If you need to know, I had asparagus last night.  So, you know what happens when you eat asparagus.  So, I was like, damn. 
[00:45:00]  So, I decided to go for the mid-leek flush.  Keep it all watered down.  Mid-leek flush?  Because you know the asparagus thing, right?  You give a courtesy flush during a leek?  If you eat asparagus, you got to, Anthony.  Absolutely.  Oh, shit.  I said absolutely.  Motherfucker.  Oh.  I should do the mousetrap every time I say absolutely.  That would probably stop it.  All right.  Go get a mousetrap.  I'm willing to do that today.  But you got to remind me because I'll forget.  I won't notice.  So, then I was, I did the mid-leek flush and all of a sudden the urinal pretty much exploded. 
[00:45:30]  And now I'm like trying to finish my leak as the water's rising in the bathroom.  It really was coming out fast because when you came in here and said I should take a look,  I went in and it looked like the Titanic.  Yeah.  Water started, it was by the front door.  It was by the front door when you took a look?  It was already starting to come out at the front door and Master Poe was like, uh, paper  towels, gentlemen.  Need some paper towels. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Don't think that was going to do it, but just enough to keep it from reaching the rug in  the hallway.  And then suddenly it just kind of stopped.  And I had a little talk with Poe about Bubba.  Oh, who's this Bubba the Love Sponge?  Oh.  Talking about Bubba?  Yeah.  He goes, I know you're a black ninja, but I'll handle it.  Is he even in New York? 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Wait, is he broadcast from Tampa?  I think he broadcasts from Tampa.  He doesn't even...  Way to go.  That's good.  That'll help your radio show.  Way to commit.  He's hedging his bet.  What is this stupid thing?  Every morning?  A new parody just came in.  What do you mean?  It's a new Bubba parody.  Listener sent in.  What the hell is going on?  Well, I guess we're fighting back with bad parodies because...  It's a bad parody battle? 
[00:47:00]  Is that what it is?  Jesus.  Well, the ONA pest will take this battle on.  Like we said earlier.  We fight his boss.  We don't fight the bitch.  That's pretty bad.  I checked the station and it's Howard. 
[00:47:30]  Can't believe it because I thought that old fucker was dead.  I just can't understand what he's talking about.  You know, even if the intention is good.  What the hell is this?  This song stinks.  What's the skin's turn?  Said something robbing.  Quill respect laughs so hard that she drowned him out.  Yeah.  Sinking in the ratings.  Stuck back in the 80s.  Stern, you're a big hat fan. 
[00:48:00]  There's nothing original.  Same old stick you're saying.  Ripped off it, you're playing again.  And Kermit D-Frog here.  And welcome to it since Amina Street.  You're fucked up.  Stern so boring.  Stern so boring.  Shut up, fucking Howie.  Don't say a word.  Stern so boring.  Get past your prime, girl.  Shut up, fucking Howie.  Stern so boring.  You're old.  You're old.  You're old.  You're listening to the voice of Howard Stern. 
[00:48:30]  And, um, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  You're listening to the voice of Howard Stern.  Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  Every morning there's an asshole coming from the speakers right next to my fucking head.  I'm like, there's nothing original.  I checked the station and it's how I can't believe it.  Cause I thought that old fucker was dead.  Yeah, I kind of feel that way.  Oh, stick games and nifty.  Now that you are 50.  Turn in the dial to Clim. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  You're once childish theatrics, but now so geriatric, my friend.  You're old.  You're past.  You're prime.  Hmm.  I don't know what you think of that one.  It got a little better when the clips came in.  Yeah.  All right.  Musically, it was an abomination to man.  They're trying.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way, Brian Regan is here.  He's going to do the whole show with us as well today. 
[00:49:30]  Hey.  He's playing Caroline's this weekend here in New York City.  I had no idea.  Brian loves being in when we're doing our little battles.  He does?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, I met the guy once.  Seemed nice enough.  That's how Brian handles the situation.  He's with Bob Saget.  Hmm?  He's with Bob Saget.  Oh.  That guy looks like Bob Saget.  Well, bring Brian in here.  He doesn't have to wait around.  Let's say hi to Anthony, Missouri. 
[00:50:00]  Anthony, what's going on today?  Yo, what's up?  Bubba rules.  All right.  All right.  That's good.  What else?  That's all you got?  That's it?  We opened the forum up for people, and that's it?  You could call with that shit all day.  Our pets are a little more clever than that.  Hey there, Brian.  What's up, Brian?  Brian Regan.  Take a seat.  Good to see you.  Yeah.  You guys too, man.  Got my buddy Bob, Bob Saget out there. 
[00:50:30]  America's Funniest Home Videos 2 is coming out.  How are you guys?  He got real dirty with the aristocrats, though, Mr. Saget.  Showed another side of him, finally.  His stand-up.  His stand-up is dirty.  See, that's what no one understands.  Like, all you comedians knew that Bob Saget was always dirty.  Right.  But schmucks like us that weren't fortunate enough to hang out with him at comedy clubs  just saw him on Full House and the America's Funniest Video.  And that was the joke to everybody that knew him. 
[00:51:00]  Right.  They were like, the hell are you playing a dad on this thing?  Because every time we bring this up, the comedians would go, he was always dirty.  We didn't know that.  We just saw the wholesome family guy on TV.  We weren't on the inside, guys.  There's separate newsletters.  There's newsletters that just comedians know.  The comics get mailed.  That we read and we chat amongst ourselves.  And then there's newsletters that, you know, radio people get.  It's finally getting out there to the average schmuck like myself that Bob Saget is actually  a very dirty guy.  We didn't know.  Dirty ain't didn't it.  It's dark. 
[00:51:30]  Dark?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's funny.  He goes into some areas that are really disturbing.  Nice and evil, man.  I found it in L.A.  I'm like, holy shit.  That's fucking...  But you just wonder, like, if, you know, the families bring the, you know, the six-year-old  twin girls out to the show and it's going to be horrified.  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with the TV presence.  No.  You got to see the aristocrats just to see what Bob Saget does and George Carlin.  Yeah.  Apparently it's coming out on DVD or...  Yeah.  It is.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  It's out already.  Out there now.  Brian, were you asked to do that?  No.  I haven't been asked to do anything yet.  That is strange, though.  I've never had a question.  No one's ever asked me to do anything at any point ever.  They pretty much asked every comedian out there to do the aristocrats.  I think they just know he's just way too nice and way too clean.  But maybe, you know, they shouldn't just...  It's very funny, but maybe this isn't his couple of years.  They shouldn't judge his business decisions on his act or something.  Who knows?  You'd be like, hey, Brian, you want to do a porno movie?  Well, yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Okay.  That sounds interesting.  I think I'll do that.  A little departure.  Yeah.  You know, I want a little multifaceted personality.  I want the people to see a different side of me.  Yeah.  I'm sure people don't, like, you know, listen to a tape of my Pop-Tart joke and go, this  guy needs to be in the aristocrats.  They just know.  Well, so then my cousin comes in, and he's got a cup of dirt.  And he does the whole aristocrats joke with just his bits from his act. 
[00:53:00]  With a nice, clean, wholesome ending to it.  And the director is like, that's not the point.  I don't think.  Right.  You've got to agree.  And so then the pilot's going, hey, I'm up here in the clouds.  I love that bit.  I love that bit.  Thanks, man.  But I want to do it like the last time I saw Brian.  So the pilot's, I'm up here in the clouds.  Oh, was I?  Holy Jesus.  You don't remember?  He had the laryngitis?  Oh, when you had the laryngitis last time, we felt, we usually sit at the same table when 
[00:53:30]  we're at Caroline's.  His laryngitis was so bad.  We felt so bad.  My girlfriend was almost crying for you because he's doing his act.  And it was like, it was disturbing the pain that I could feel in your throat.  Do you ever get that?  Do you ever get laryngitis when you're performing?  Oh, no.  No?  I've been lucky with that shit, man.  Man.  The guy performs twice a year.  It's not like.  And I've been lucky, motherfucker.  Two times.  I could have laryngitis.  That could have happened. 
[00:54:00]  Brian was losing his.  Just half your shows, you had laryngitis.  Brian's like, you know, 363 days a year he's working.  And we watched him just, his voice went as the set went on and on.  And he still pulled it off.  Still did it.  Well, I mean, I appreciate it.  But sometimes I'll like go into some joke that right when I started, I realized, you  know, I have to like, like the ironing board noise or the bird call joke or something.  The bird call.  I'm not going to be able to pull this off.  And I'm like, have you ever noticed that?  Watching golf on TV and play the bird calls? 
[00:54:30]  And then I'm trying to do bird calls, which I can't do to begin with.  Nothing's coming out.  And I'm like.  It was one of the funniest things I've seen, though, man.  The crowd's just staring at me like.  When did you realize that?  Oh, why did I decide to do this joke?  He even addressed it on stage.  It's like, maybe I shouldn't pick this joke.  Brian's a legend, too, man. 
[00:55:00]  He got so many sons in the business.  I mean, and I mean, not that he fucked up with me.  He's got so many dudes.  If you travel around and you see anybody, it's like, he has so many fucking embryos walking  around.  Yeah.  Doing him.  It's like, is this fucking Brian?  Could you stop, please, Brian Regan?  Yeah.  You know, it's really, well, it's first of all, it's like flattering that anyone would.  It's not flattering, Brian.  Stop.  It's Brian.  It's flattering.  It's not fucking flattering.  No, it's like.  Mike's go off. 
[00:55:30]  He's like, these motherfuckers need to die.  Exactly.  And not even with that timing.  These fucking cocksuckers.  He got a lot of kids.  That's another way to look at it.  He got a lot of kids out there.  Oh, it's flattering.  It's a testimonial to me.  And that's how you call it.  Fuck my dick, motherfucker.  I've never heard that.  That's pretty funny.  He's got a lot of kids out there.  You know, he's got a lot of kids.  My comedy kids.  Comedy kids, yeah.  Fucking Goofy, what's his name on the radio?  My boy, yeah. 
[00:56:00]  He does Air America in the morning.  Mark Maron?  Maron got a lot of children.  Him and the whole Patton Oswalt universe, that's all children of Mark Maron.  All Mark Maron's kids.  Really?  I've got a lot of kids.  I've got a lot of children.  Really?  I've got a lot of children.  Patrice O'Neal's children.  A lot of children.  Not as many as Regan, though.  Regan is fucking, they got Nash.  He's fucking all over the country.  We should have my children open for you and your children open for me. 
[00:56:30]  It'd be a hell of a show.  Have you ever had to follow somebody that was, like, doing you?  One of my kids, though.  I bet that happened to me a few times.  Oh, no.  He had to have it happen more.  See, I'll travel.  I don't, it's just, I ain't lying.  And I'm not, you know, blowing them, but I'm saying, Regan got a lot of fucking kids, man.  How do you deal with that?  I think your kids are open for me.  How do you deal with that?  Well, sometimes, like, you know, you'll show up at a club and you don't know who the other acts are.  And, you know, you'll be in the back, you know, getting ready.  And you'll, I'll hear a guy on stage, I feel so stupid. 
[00:57:00]  And I'm like, what am I going to say now?  Motherfucking knock on his dressing door.  Hey, Brian, come watch me.  This is for you.  Does it cross?  This one's for you, Brian.  Like he's dead, but he's watching him.  And I'm going over there.  And fucking this.  I like Patrice's version of your acts pretty good.  Brian's going over there for some reason.  He's going over there.  I'm going over there.  He's going over here.  He's just going over there. 
[00:57:30]  I'm going to do that joke.  Yeah, write that down.  I'm going over there.  It's the going over there joke.  That's really good.  Hey, Pat from Florida has a connection to Brian Regan.  Pat, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys?  Good.  Hey, man.  I was the one that was the winning bidder on that Brian Regan cup of dirt.  Do you remember signing the cup of dirt?  You know, I don't even know what that got up to.  You signed it and just went on to the next city.  How much did we get for that, Pat?  $400.  $400.  $400. 
[00:58:00]  For a cup of dirt for Brian Regan.  For a good cause.  Proudly displayed in my son's room.  But I just want to say, we saw Brian in November down in Orlando.  And I had my whole family there.  It was a great show.  The funniest part about Brian is in the encore, people start yelling out, hey, do this routine,  do that routine.  And just the way he segues into it, it's just the most hysterical thing.  It made me and my whole family just laugh out loud.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Thank you, man.  Tell us about two things of that call.  Thank you.  Encore.  Uh-huh. 
[00:58:30]  And my whole family.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  He's one of these comedians where they request bits like songs, like you're seeing your favorite  band.  Well, they're not my bits.  You know, they get bored with me and they start yelling out Richard Pryor stuff.  George Carlin routine.  Do seven dirty words.  Something.  Entertain us.  Yeah, Brian's proud.  Brian's proud.  Do mud bone.  Yeah, mud bone.  I was born in Tubalow, Mississippi.  I was going over there. 
[00:59:00]  My mom was a prostitute.  I was going over there.  And then I set myself on fire in the crack.  So then I went over there.  Let's go to Ryan in D.C.  Ryan.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Ryan.  We're hanging with Brian Regan.  He's at Caroline's all weekend long here in New York City.  Brian, this is unbelievable, man.  I've got both of the satellite radios up until yesterday in my car.  Yeah.  I've now made my decision to stick with XM just because my father,  10 years ago, he brought me in and said, 
[00:59:30]  Ryan, you've got to get in here.  You've got to see this guy on TV.  I think you're on Letterman.  Oh, okay.  And so we sat down 10 years ago.  And since that point, every time you're on a radio show or you're in town,  you're in Dallas or you're in Baltimore,  we call each other and we say, we've got to see this guy.  We've got to see this guy.  So I've seen you at least three or four times.  I just got to say, thank you very much.  Man, thank you.  Brian just sucks out of that.  You must have a house right between Dallas and Baltimore.  That was a little weird, right?  That's a really nice compliment, man.  Thanks.  There was one time, actually, where I went to go visit my dad in Dallas. 
[01:00:00]  You were in, I think you were in, I don't know, were you in Addison or something?  But your brother was with you, too.  Yeah.  Funny guy.  Funny guy also.  And then I flew back to D.C. because that's where I lived.  And my parents were actually visiting the very next weekend.  And then we saw you again at the Improv in D.C.  So you were over there and then you went over there.  I was glad to be over there, Joe.  How is Dennis doing?  He's doing great, man.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks, man.  I'll see you next month, Brian.  All right, cool.  All right, Mark.  All right.  My brother Dennis is writing for the King of Queens.  Is he?  Oh. 
[01:00:30]  For a long time, right?  For like two and a half years now.  A little show called The King of Queens.  Well, they tape on Fridays, so that's why he and I can't work together as much as we used to.  But he just did a Letterman a couple weeks ago.  That was fun when you guys would tour together because he's like a twisted version of you.  Yeah.  He's the fucking evil Brian.  He's got a side to him that's pretty interesting.  He gets a little darker than Brian.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  Let's go to Randy in Arizona.  Randy, what's up?  Hey, Brian. 
[01:01:00]  It's Terry from Australia.  Hey, man.  Hey, I was over down in Phoenix on Friday night.  It was pretty awesome.  Thanks, man.  I, uh...  You want to explain this?  No, I can explain it.  I told him...  This is true.  I'm from a family of eight kids.  Yeah.  But if you're from a big family, you know that you torment your younger brothers and sisters.  So we told our youngest brother, Terry, that there are nine kids in the family.  And we told him that we...  This is true.  We told him we had an older brother named Joe who didn't like Terry when he was born, so Joe moved to Australia. 
[01:01:30]  And we would fake phone calls, you know, like Terry would be in the room and we would fake phone calls.  It's Joe from Australia.  Hey, Joe.  Hey.  Hey, you seen any kangaroos?  Yeah?  Hey.  Hey, you want to talk to Terry?  No.  He doesn't want to talk to you.  He doesn't want to talk to you, Terry. 
[01:02:00]  It's pretty damn cruel.  Terrible thing to do to Terry.  Terrible.  That's a great idea.  That's psychological torture.  Psychological torture.  Like, it's one thing if you go up behind a sibling and smack him in the back of the head or something,  but that is some severe, like, terrorist, you go home today, you dress you up,  and then they, like, take you out, blindfold, drive you around in the car,  you take the blindfold off, and you're back at the prison.  Maybe not today.  Like, it's that type of psychological warfare.  Well, I mean, with me and my brother Dennis and my other brothers, you know, 
[01:02:30]  I mean, like, we would come up with this stuff.  And the thing is, it was so bizarre that you could just always claim, like,  why would you make something like that up?  That is one of those things, yeah.  Oh, we would make up that we have a brother in Australia.  A brother named Joe in Australia.  How would we make that up?  And then he would, like, walk out of the room wondering, you know?  How old were you doing this?  We were, like, you know, 12, 13.  And how old was Joe supposed to be?  Joe was, like, you know, 19, 20.  He moved away. 
[01:03:00]  He moved away on his own.  Just because he didn't like Terry.  He didn't like Terry.  And did your parents play along with this, Brian?  The parents get along?  We made sure they weren't in the room when we did it.  Of course.  There was never a Joe.  They would have blown the whole bit.  Right.  Let's go to My Big Cans.  My Big Cans.  What's up?  What's going on?  How are you?  Nervous.  Oh, a little nervous.  Why are you nervous?  I don't know.  Well, you know, I haven't spoken to them since they were, you know, since they were on NEW. 
[01:03:30]  Spoken to who?  Talking to ONA.  I called a couple of times when they were in the WNEW studios.  Oh, you want to get through on the air and talk to Opie and Anthony?  Hi.  That old gag.  Never works anymore.  Is that her?  We're looking at a picture of you and...  Jiminy Cricket.  And you got Big Cans.  My Big Cans.  Yeah.  Is this from your webcam?  Actually, it's from the camera phone.  Camera phone? 
[01:04:00]  Brian, you're doing...  I like the way we all get one of these handed to us like we're at the Pentagon.  Yeah.  This is a great thing.  And this is an important document that we need to address.  This is our target, gentlemen.  Does everyone have one in front of them?  Does everyone have a document?  I was thinking more like we're back at school and the teacher just handed out dittos.  All right.  We're looking at our primary and secondary targets.  I noticed that shit and never said... 
[01:04:30]  It's like...  They always do that and I always look at it like...  Because I don't want to just go, what the fuck you gave me this time?  Just hand them out.  Like a faceless, nameless guy comes in, passes them out.  You know, we just...  Go ahead, man.  No, go ahead, Brian.  I was saying, like, if I forget and just, like, put this in my little pocket and bring it back and, you know, then my family opens it up.  What is this all about?  I was at work.  This is part of my work.  Part of my job.  Part of my work.  What is your shirt that you have pulled down, say? 
[01:05:00]  I see some lettering there.  It says...  God, I don't remember.  I think it says His Old Lady.  It's a Harley shirt.  You know what it says?  I can make it out.  You can?  It says, it was the best of times.  It was the worst of times.  It's the start of a novel.  Yeah.  Well, how big are those cans there, my big cans?  There's 36 double D's.  36 double D's.  Is that a tat on the left one?  Yeah.  What is it, a cross?  Yeah, that was when I was 16. 
[01:05:30]  How can you tell it's a cross?  You'd have to climb the mountain just to see what it is.  I was looking at it.  It's right on the horizon of her breast.  Well, that was when I had tiny little bee cups.  What?  What do you mean?  Well, that was when they were much smaller.  Oh, she got the tattoo on the boob.  Oh, when you were 16, you had bees.  And then now it's got all stretched out, so the tattoo's got to look awful.  And then...  It was a cocoon.  Wow.  Now it's a pigeon.  A little cross, and now it's actual size.  It's what Jesus was put on.  It's what Jesus was put on.  Oh, my God. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, now someone...  Oh, my God.  Room for Romans and the other two guys that were next to him.  Oh, my God.  And Miranda's...  And the Romans.  Oh, my God.  The Virgin Mary's hanging out by the nipple.  Oh, God.  The whole timeline.  Oh, that's awful.  By the way, we finally saw the Passion of the Christ with the Benny Hill music.  Oh, Jesus, man.  Deeply disturbing.  It's fucking so long.  Now I understand why WebJunk 20 wouldn't run that on your show, Patrice.  I couldn't have did that shit. 
[01:06:30]  It's on opianathony.com.  It's funny and disturbing at the same time.  Somebody just put that soundtrack to it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yes.  As he's getting, like, pummeled, it is painful to watch.  The movie, I guess, is bad enough without the Benny Hill music.  With the Benny Hill music, it is so disturbing to watch.  Yeah, that shit was...  There was nothing funny in there.  I couldn't figure out the whole thing.  I'm like, I don't know.  Fuck that.  No.  Well, the video's up at opianathony.com. 
[01:07:00]  Well, now, you're a big gal?  Yes, I am.  How much do you weigh there?  Actually, not that big.  I'm only about a little fat in the ass.  I'm about $1.70.  $1.70 height?  About $5.9.  $5.9.  You know what's odd?  I look at your picture.  From the neck up, it's Jimmy Norton.  Oh, my God.  Is that true?  I swear to you.  I was kind of rearing back trying to get the picture.  Rearing back?  You are chinless. 
[01:07:30]  That never works.  Just like our little pal Jimmy.  Even if you're thin, that never works when you go back for a picture.  Awful.  Because it looks like you have no chin, and it also looks like you're growing like a  goatee.  Oh, God, no.  Well, there's a, you know, because you got a little, um, uh, am I wrong?  Patrice, am I wrong?  You all are being so brutal and nice at the same time.  I guess a girl would call it a dimple.  Yeah, um, it looks like your chinless pumpkin.  Look, I've been known to be a little outrageous on this program, so let's ask Brian Reagan.  Brian, does it look like she's growing a goatee? 
[01:08:00]  You know, that might be like an optical illusion.  Right.  You know, it depends on how you look at it.  But I think, obviously, she doesn't have one.  She has a nice face.  I think the printer stuttered there and, uh, printed out a little more ink.  That's where...  Certain fax machines aren't that good.  They come out, they have little glitches in them.  Brian's so nice, he's even keeping a live face on radio.  It's like...  Yeah.  He has a smile.  He's pleasant.  He's always pleasant.  His eyes aren't watering or nothing.  It's not like, you know, we're not pointing out everything. 
[01:08:30]  I actually like those titties, man.  You like that?  Yeah.  Her face couldn't be bad enough to fuck those titties.  You like that Picasso left nipple?  I like it.  Those big rink, the big areolas, man.  Now, one's pointing up, one's pointing down.  Which one is the right and which one is the left?  Is it her right or your right?  I'm looking right on the document that you were given at the beginning of the meeting.  To our right.  Yes.  All documents when being considered.  Exhibit B.  They're heavy.  Those are nice tits, man.  Those are nice tits, dude. 
[01:09:00]  Because they're just heavy.  God kind of blessed me with them there.  And they're not hangy.  They're like close.  Yeah, they're meaty and hangy.  All right, so why is my big can's calling in, by the way?  Because I want to play Guesses in my pants.  Oh, Brian.  You haven't played this game with us in a very long time.  Yeah.  Am I familiar with this?  I believe you've played once.  You may have blocked it out of your memory.  This is the game where a girl calls up.  She takes the telephone and rubs it on her most intimate of areas, up and down, side to side, 
[01:09:30]  and then in a circular fashion.  And just from the sound, made over the phone, we will determine what type of hairstyle she has down there.  Wow.  It is the standard triangle.  Is it the mohawk?  Is it the little tiny Hitler mustache?  Or is it the clean-shaven, wood floor, or as we like to call it, the JonBenet Ramsey?  Yeah.  Wait a second.  Didn't they do this on...  Wasn't this an NBC game show?  Yes.  Back at Chuck Barris Productions. 
[01:10:00]  Chuck Barris, right?  Yeah.  It was right after his success of the gong show where they let him do anything.  Guess what's in my pants?  That was my Chuck Barris impression.  Yeah, it was very good.  By the way, where's the mousetrap?  You want to do mousetraps today?  No, that was yesterday.  I am not doing mousetraps today.  But it would be so much fun if Brian Regan did mousetraps.  Brian will not do mousetraps.  You never know.  Brian is above that.  I don't know what the mousetraps is.  Bill Burr does mousetraps.  Bill Burr came up with a fine bit for us.  See, but Brian rarely, rarely, if ever, bombs. 
[01:10:30]  Well, so maybe he would want to do it.  So what's the idea behind it?  He looks a little frightened.  Yesterday.  See, yesterday.  Why don't you just show him the bruises on your right hand, Anthony?  If there was a problem.  I hate setting these things.  Yeah, we got mousetraps in the studio.  So scary.  Bill Burr started this yesterday.  If a guy bombs on the show, you have to take a mousetrap.  Yeah.  You know when you hit?  Yeah, if you said something.  You know when you try a joke and it's obviously just a dud. 
[01:11:00]  It didn't happen.  Yeah.  You would take a mousetrap to the head.  Hey, that would have been a little easier if you used a Buick.  Oh, and then you got to, you got to, you know.  Ow!  Ow!  He just did one of them.  See?  And even our big boss did it yesterday.  So, Brian, are you willing to take a mousetrap today?  I'll take a mousetrap.  Sure.  It hurts.  It really does.  Actually, I got my own little thing.  I got a crutch on this show.  I say absolutely a lot.  So if I say that today on the show, I'm going to take a mousetrap. 
[01:11:30]  What is the deal with the oven mitts that you're wearing?  Different game.  Ow!  Oh, it got me while I was setting it.  I knew it.  Oh, God, I hate mousetrap.  These were left over from a little stunt we did on our show a couple days ago where we  had, you know, Stalker Patty.  Yes.  She needed rent money, so she came in here and she got completely naked.  50 years old.  We put a blindfold on her and the listeners collected her rent money, $2,000. 
[01:12:00]  So there were two $1,000 checks on the floor.  She had to crawl around naked with a blindfold on trying to find the checks and there were  mousetraps all around.  Is this how most people make rent?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was screaming.  She was screaming.  The video.  Great.  You know, we should play the video for Brian Regan, actually.  Let me ask you, would this break, I don't know anything, would this break a bone?  I think it would. 
[01:12:30]  Brian.  I mean, like, if I were to put my hand on there, could that, like, break a finger?  If you did it like this, where all the energy was being absorbed by one finger bone, perhaps  it could break it.  What you want to do is take the meaty part of your palm and put it in there.  I got it.  Do the palm.  Don't do the fingers.  Like this.  Yeah.  Jeez.  You're going to do one?  Yeah, I'll just give it a shot.  All right.  Brian, you sure you want...  Ow! 
[01:13:00]  No wonder people don't put their hands in mousetraps.  I always wondered why people didn't just wake up and stick their hands in mousetraps.  I can't describe to you how funny that was to watch.  You're a grown man with kids.  Ow!  You're a father, and we just bring it out of people.  Now I have a lesson I can tell them when I'm tucking them in at night. 
[01:13:30]  And never, ever put your hand in a mousetrap.  My big cans, we're going to get back to you in a second.  Stay there.  Ow!  So...  Damn, I would hate to be a rat.  Do we have the Stalker Patty clip?  You know, you think it's overkill for the mouse?  Like, if it's hurting you that bad, it's really overkill for the mouse.  They got tiny little bones, man.  Oh, a little.  It's just got to be an agonite.  Did you just get one?  Almost, man.  You're not doing the mousetrap?  Fuck you.  It's true saying. 
[01:14:00]  You can car crash me, or you can hit me with a real car, motherfucker.  Fuck around him.  That's much better if Brian Regan doesn't, anyway.  That was very good.  That hurt.  All right, we're going to play the clip of Stalker Patty.  Left on mark.  Anthony.  So, uh, this is Stalker Patty, naked, crawling around, trying to find her rent checks, uh, blindfolded with mousetraps all over the floor.  It's a quick clip.  Listen to this.  Get her on all fours.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Patty, here's the deal. 
[01:14:30]  You hear my voice?  All right, you've got to come toward me.  There's ten, uh, mousetraps in front of you.  I don't know where you are.  And she allowed to curl her fingers up like that.  Uh, yeah, she could do whatever she wants.  You've got to feel around for the checks as you move forward, okay?  Oh, I'm so scared.  I am.  Yes, but just think of the wonderful prizes.  You're going to win at the end of this.  $2,000, Patty.  Oh, no.  No, no, do that.  $2,000, Patty. 
[01:15:00]  Come on, come on.  Oh, no, God.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't.  It wasn't.  It wasn't.  Okay, that was, that was.  Don't move.  That was, that was not the check.  Oh, this is so.  Obviously not.  It's skipping a lot.  Feel around for the check, Patty. 
[01:15:30]  You're almost there.  $2,000 on the.  Oh, my God.  That hit me.  My finger.  That's what it's supposed to do.  Hey, if you were a mouse, you'd be dead.  Come on, keep crawling.  Come on, old mouse.  By the way.  Do you think mice get $2,000 at the end of this?  They don't.  By the way, if you don't find the checks by the end of the show, then they stay on the  floor until tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  That was the back of the hand. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, my God.  It's just got the palm of my hand.  She's going to have to give the teller to check with her mouth.  Wow, you're mean.  You're mean.  Patty, we're running out of show.  Come on, Patty.  We're running out of show.  All your problems could go away.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I built a piece of paper.  Do I have a check?  I think I do.  You just got $1,000.  Yeah, there it is.  One check.  One check.  One to go.  One to go.  $1,000.  Oh. 
[01:16:30]  Ow.  There it is.  There's just a little clip.  The video's up on opianthony.com.  You've got to see the whole video of her naked crawling around with a blindfold.  Patrice had a pretty much tap out on that bit.  Patrice was deeply disturbed by the end of that.  But at the time when it was happening, it was bothering me, man. 
[01:17:00]  I rationalized it and got through, you know.  Yeah, that's how we get through our days, too.  You had a whole discussion with Bob Kelly about that.  I was describing that yesterday.  Yeah.  Because you were telling me.  Me and Bob was just like, dude, that was disturbing, dude.  It's just pain inflicted on innocent victims.  You know, when you look at it that way.  All right.  So we got my big cans standing by.  My big cans?  Yeah.  All right.  So you're going to play Guess What's in My Pants?  Yeah.  Anthony described the game, I believe.  Yeah.  You did?  You take the phone, rub it in various directions on her vag, and we will guess, based on the 
[01:17:30]  sound alone coming from the phone, what type of hairstyle she has.  Standard triangle, standard issue girl triangle of hair, or the mohawk, which is a strip of  hair, the Hitler mustache, which is a strip of hair but only shaved down even further, so  it's just like a little square, and the clean-shaven wood floor.  All right.  That's it.  Well, we need to take the song.  Those are the choices.  See if we've got a theme, Brian.  A little wacky, dumb, dumb music.  That's the red music.  It's time to play. 
[01:18:00]  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Guess what's in my pants?  Place the receiver upon your beaver.  Receiver beaver.  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  All right.  My big cans.  Yes.  30-year-old female.  Big cans.  Kind of a big girl. 
[01:18:30]  No chin and a goatee.  No chin.  From what we see, it looks like Jimmy Norton from the mouth down.  Oh, no.  It's still not that like that.  All right.  Well, just from the picture we saw.  Yeah.  You had to scrunch your face to get in the...  All right.  Are you somewhere where you can be nude?  Yes.  And you are nude?  Yes.  Wonderful.  Take the phone and rub it in an up-and-down fashion on your intimates.  Okay.  Let's listen in now, people.  Very important. 
[01:19:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Wow, that's the quietest we've ever heard.  Wait, wait, wait.  Are you rubbing where you talk or where you listen on the phone?  No, where you talk.  Where you talk.  You actually rubbed it up and down.  Yes.  Could you press a little harder and do it a few times, kind of faster than you were doing it?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Hold on. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  There we go.  That's better.  Is that better?  All right.  Yeah.  We're going to need a few more times, though.  Do it like, you know, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten times.  Okay.  Very obvious.  Obvious at this point?  Extremely obvious.  All right.  Now do the same thing side to side.  Here's where it gets very telling, based on the sound.  I can barely hear anything. 
[01:20:00]  That's why it's obvious.  All right.  Now press down hard and go around and around in circles.  Make sure you press hard.  I am.  I am.  Okay.  I press hard.  All right.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:20:30]  Who's guessing first?  Now remember, don't tell us.  Don't even go.  Don't give us any hints as we guess until we ask you.  I think in honor of Brian Regan in studio, playing Carolines all weekend long here in New York City, Brian should go first.  I'm going to have to recuse myself.  I'm going to recuse myself.  You're recusing yourself?  Yeah.  I think I have an unfair advantage on this one.  I don't recuse me.  He's found that he has an unfair advantage that would not be fair to the rest of us, so he's removing himself from this competition. 
[01:21:00]  Code four, my wife is listening and she will kill me.  That's what judges say.  You don't want to?  No, I'm not.  I'm not going to take a guess in any direction.  He's not guessing.  Wow.  Wow.  Jesus.  It is.  You know something?  I want to find love like that.  I just want to find that kind of love, man.  Where you don't even want to guess.  He obviously has an interview with Disney.  I'm not interested.  He doesn't want to.  Yeah, that's what it is. 
[01:21:30]  A career, a family, just the delicious shit that makes you not even want to guess a hairy snatch.  Yeah, Disney, look, those guys put the asses in the seats at Caroline's.  I'm never a part of their shenanigans or antics.  I only go so far.  I only go so far to fit in a little so I can come back again next time.  But I didn't take part in any of their guess the pants thing. 
[01:22:00]  I'll even play you the game.  I refuse.  What was the word I used?  I recused myself.  I recused myself over there and then I was over here.  Hey, Brian, what did you recuse yourself of?  I recused myself of not playing the game.  What game is that, Brian?  The Guess Something About Pants.  What something about what pants?  I don't know.  I was going over there.  Over there where, Brian?  I was over here.  All right, I'll see you at the meeting. 
[01:22:30]  I just wish my life was good enough for me to think about shit like that.  No, I'm not going to do that, man.  I'm not going to do it.  I'm like, oh, the business pussy sounds like it.  Sounds like spiders fighting antelopes down that motherfucker.  Fighting no career, no family.  Jesus Christ.  Brian's got a lot of meetings to go to after this show.  It's very obvious.  Layton is very full and very wholesome.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:23:00]  A wholesome interview.  As they take away, it's got milk.  Fuck.  Oh, my God.  When you think about it, there's four of us.  If two guess one and two guess the other, then you've got to fit.  Now it's two out of three.  You've got a majority, a clear majority.  It's good for the game.  He makes a good point.  It's good for the game.  The guy makes a good point.  Now there's not a guaranteed winner.  That's right.  He's a true friend, though.  He continues to come on this program, man.  Love him.  All right.  Well, I'm going to guess the obvious. 
[01:23:30]  It's cleanly shaven this morning.  All right.  See, you've been right the past two times, dead on right.  I've gone against it based on my instinct.  The last one I was wrong, because remember, it was a whole mess down there.  It looked like a drunk landscaper was involved, remember?  You said it was shaved, though, on Friday.  Yeah, and it was.  She said it was, and then we went deeper and realized it was just a mess, because she showed  us on Pal Talk, remember?  It had turned into a mess, but you knew it was shaved on Friday. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, all right.  I was stunned.  It ruined that much?  Yeah.  Because we saw it on Pal Talk.  Yeah, it's not your fault she grows hair like Grizzly Adams.  It was, you knew exactly when it was shaved.  Clean shaven this morning.  So that makes me want to kind of piggyback on, but you're due for a loss.  Yes.  I'm thinking the lack of sound is because it is so bushy and wispy that it's not giving  that Velcro-like, short, ripping sound on the phone. 
[01:24:30]  Brian, you would know about this.  Both those are valid arguments, I can see going with either line of thinking.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  So my guess here is going to be the natural triangle.  Okay.  Patrice O'Neill.  Bald.  You're saying bald, too.  Yeah, I'm saying bald.  So there's nothing going on down there whatsoever.  The clean shave has always been deceiving because sometimes it sounds, it makes the most noise  when it's shaved.  Yeah.  Even when it's clean shaved, just been shaved, because you're rubbing on skin. 
[01:25:00]  I'm going to say clean shaven and sweaty.  Well.  No, it's not sweaty because it gets stuck.  It was sliding pretty good.  Yeah, you just made a good point I never thought of.  Yeah.  It might have a little stubble.  I'm thinking just a triangle.  Okay.  Is that it, Brian?  You sure you don't want to get in with what?  No, you guys have some great answers.  I'm looking forward to hearing the answers.  What would you like to write down your answer?  In secret.  In secret.  I'll abstain. 
[01:25:30]  All right, Big Cans, if you would now please tell us what is in your pants.  Well, it's a combo.  Well, I have a little landing strip, and the very bottom by the lips are shaved.  That would be a Hitler mustache.  Yes, it would.  We are all wrong.  I was ready to hit the bell.  And funny enough, that is what Brian wrote down.  Hitler mustache.  So, Brian is the winner.  I guessed a combo, but I was thinking, like, the burger fries and the medium drink. 
[01:26:00]  Is that why you wrote down the number four?  I was wondering what that meant, but now it makes sense.  Number four combo.  Oh, we're all wrong.  We're losers.  All right, my Big Cans, thanks for playing.  Guess what's in my pants.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Did you hear the song again?  It is a fun song.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants.  Place the receiver. 
[01:26:30]  Up on your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants.  It's time to guess.  What's in my pants.  My pants.  Holy shit.  What happened?  Lil.  Lil on cam, on Pal Talk, is deep-throating a banana, and it is goddamn ridiculous.  Wow.  Another one to watch.  Hey, Lil.  Deep-throat the rest of that banana. 
[01:27:00]  Let's take another look at that.  Hold on.  We'll get to you in a second.  She ate a piece of it, which kind of ruined it a little bit because now it's shorter.  And now she's trying to eat it, like, chew it and swallow so she can deep-throat the rest of it.  You might have to explain this to Brian Reagan.  Oh, this is Pal Talk.  You make pals.  Who doesn't like pals?  You just go around.  These are people from all over the country that listen to the show.  And you can pop up their camera and watch them. 
[01:27:30]  Hey, Lil.  Could you flash, Brian?  Let's see what she's got in store.  She's a good girl.  Look at that.  Isn't that what she's flashing right now?  And she really goes at it.  At night, she might get a few wines in her or something.  And, boy, we've seen her put on some shows.  It's fantabulous.  Wow. 
[01:28:00]  Look at her.  She's all laughing and having a good time.  Things have changed since we were here last, Brian.  And isn't this what the technology age is all about?  That's right.  Well, what people don't know is Brian just burned both his eyes out.  So he refuses to look.  So he can still take that meeting with Disney.  Oh, she went to get another banana?  All right.  Is that what she did?  She does that.  Let's go to Mike in Kentucky.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What are y'all doing? 
[01:28:30]  We're having fun with Brian Regan.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, I'm in the Army, man.  I got my whole platoon out here.  We're in the field.  All right.  Hey.  Hey, can you all play the chicken fucker audio for us?  Oh, Brian would probably love to hear it.  Hey, I keep hyping it up, man, and they all want to hear it.  All right.  Can you guys fire off some rounds for us?  Hey, they don't give us guns, man.  What kind of army are you?  Salvation.  Yeah, that's it.  We're out here in the field. 
[01:29:00]  They've got bells.  Ring the bell.  Hey, we're out for basic training and shit.  But no guns.  You little maggot.  You make me want a bullet.  No guns.  No guns.  All right.  All right.  We'll play the chicken audio for you.  Hey, you're a man.  Got the dildo.  Hey, have a good morning.  All right.  Thank you, Mike, and the gang in Kentucky there.  You want to play this for Brian?  Sure.  The chicken audio.  Yeah, this is audio of a German gentleman and a girl assisting him. 
[01:29:30]  And he is, who would think people would do this?  But you'd think it would be as obvious as not putting your hand in a mousetrap.  You don't fuck chickens.  But this guy wants to have sex with a chicken.  He's going to leave us.  Is this an actual, I mean, this is...  Yeah, this is the audio tape of a guy having sex with a chicken.  Okay.  And you can really tell when the chicken gets it because it's just making regular chicken  noises.  And then it kind of makes, even though you never have heard it before, you know the sound 
[01:30:00]  of a chicken being fucked.  You mean when it dawns on the chicken what's happening to you?  Right.  When the chicken, even that little pea brain, finally realizes, uh-oh, this is trouble.  Puts everything together?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  We want him to stick around.  Brian understands the show.  We'll do some clean stuff in a little while.  I want to hear the...  All right.  He wants to hear it.  Here it is.  By the way, the soundtrack is from Thousand, I don't know. 
[01:30:30]  I own it.  Macht es SpaÃŸ?  Du HÃ¼hnerflicker.  Ja.  Ja.  Ich bin ganz wild auf dieser Henne.  Ja.  Ja.  Ja. 
[01:31:00]  Ja.  Ja.  Ja.  Ja.  That's good.  Ja.  Ja.  Ja.  Ja.  Ja.  Ja.  Ja.  Ja.  It's possible that this could be incorrect.  It could be that that chicken is laughing at a very funny joke. 
[01:31:30]  You know how like when you really get, you know, somebody's really making you laugh and you start, yeah, exactly.  Maybe there's like a Three Stooges tape.  I think they're showing that chicken a Three Stooges tape with Curly.  Who got this?  That they still make rubber chicken.  Hey, let me tell you something, folks. 
[01:32:00]  He's fucking dizzy on this.  That's the silliest thing I've ever heard.  That's mirth.  That's mirth.  That's enjoying humor.  They didn't even make an authentic looking chicken head on this rubber chicken.  He's like a cartoon head.  Let's go to Dave on Long Island.  Yeah, that was really bad.  Let's see what he has.  Dave, what's up? 
[01:32:30]  Hi.  I just wanted to know, Brian, what would it take to get you to curse?  Your hand in a car door or living with Patrice?  Yeah, even the mousetrap didn't get a curse out of him.  Nothing.  He didn't even go.  He just went out.  He doesn't get that?  You guys had me curse on this show.  Have you ever cursed?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, he curses.  When you guys first came over to XM.  Yeah.  Yep.  You said damn.  No.  He said ass.  I said shitty.  Yes.  And he said it again. 
[01:33:00]  He did say shitty.  But that is the PG-13 deal that he signed at Warner Brothers.  He gets one shitty, two asses, and a fuck holidays on the deal.  He just used up his shitty for the year.  I used it up for the year.  I didn't want the T-Y at the end, but they said you got to soften it up.  Right.  That makes it fun.  It makes it fun, it makes it playful, and it makes you wild over the edge. 
[01:33:30]  You just teetered on the edge.  It's shitty.  Shit is bad.  Oh, no.  I wouldn't say that.  No.  You add a little Y on here and wholesomes it up.  All right.  There you go, Dave.  Brian Regan cursing.  It's always a lot of fun when he does that.  We're going to take a break.  Brian Regan playing Carolines here in New York City all weekend long.  This is the kind of friend Brian Regan is.  It needs to be pointed out, Anthony.  All right.  His Thursday show at Carolines, that's tonight, sold out. 
[01:34:00]  His show's on Friday, sold out.  His show's on Saturday night, sold out.  There's no reason for him to be here, basically.  Oh, my God.  I didn't realize that.  I didn't realize that.  Hey, thanks for having me.  I'm sitting here taking mousetraps to the hand to try to move some tickets.  Sold out.  That's unbelievable.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  And we're your big supporters here in New York.  We didn't even know you were coming.  How long have you been selling out, Brian? 
[01:34:30]  How many years?  Like 15 strikes?  No, no, no.  It's just like, you know, the last couple kind of thing.  A couple years or so.  I'm going to let Brian in on a secret at Carolines.  Something you don't even know.  Do you know there's a curtain that they close and half of that place can actually, those empty seats,  you can close a curtain and not even know they're back there.  And when they close, there's a picture of me when they close a curtain.  I am king of the clothes fucking curtains.  I was going to say, it's known as the Rich Voss curtain.  Oh, Voss has seen that curtain. 
[01:35:00]  You got motherfuckers like me and Voss who go, hey, they opened up the curtain tonight?  Cool, man.  Cool.  Brian didn't even know the curtain existed.  There's a wall they opened up for Dane Cook.  Hey, Bob from Florida has something really fast.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, Opie and I just wanted to ask you, who's the first, the chicken or the guy?  That's kind of a chicken egg thing.  Sir, do you have a mousetrap at home?  No, I'm driving.  Put your hand in it. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, we told the listeners to go out and buy a mousetrap so when they bomb, they can take a mousetrap at home, too.  All right, we'll do it.  Very interactive show.  You guys should be able to take a mousetrap as well.  Has anybody done that yet?  I want to hear a listener take a mousetrap.  No.  See, that would be a true fan.  I think they'd lie, though.  Yeah, they would lie.  You could tell by the scream whether they're lying or not.  Put a pencil in there and go, oh, I've hurt myself.  Yeah, then they didn't do it.  Ooh.  Ouch.  You know, if they say ouch.  Ouch.  All right.  We're going to break.  I should say there's some tickets available for Brian Regan's show on Sunday. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, okay.  Those are going to go real fast as well.  Caroline's Comedy Club here in New York City.  212-757-4100.  A great club for the people that are visiting New York, by the way.  You know, it's great when Brian plays Caroline's, the owners.  They actually play the...  It's amazing.  I'd like to ask Brian one question.  Yeah, sure.  Now, did you follow the...  Are you doing the MySpace? 
[01:36:30]  Do you do the internet?  Do you do the keep in touch with your fans?  Do you do the...  That's the Dane Cook route of success.  Well, I'm not the Dane Cook, but everybody seems to think...  You know, Opie thinks I'm a fucking loser, but I want to know if Brian...  I'll say why you're a loser.  Wait a minute.  This guy doesn't know how to promote himself.  You motherfucker.  This guy's one of the funniest guys out there.  He doesn't know how to promote himself.  He doesn't even have a website yet.  I got a fucking website.  PatriceO'Neal.com.  I do?  Yeah, it works.  It works.  But you're not a big fucking Brian...  Come see Brian Regan kind of guy? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, I don't want to...  Yeah, I mean, like somebody...  A friend emailed about the MySpace thing about a month ago.  I had never heard about that and then asked if...  You know, but I don't have anything on there.  It's like he's testifying in front of the Senate committee.  A friend of mine once told...  A friend of mine had informed me that a thing called MySpace exists.  I am aware of its existence, but I do not participate in any way in this MySpace. 
[01:37:30]  Let me tell you what's going on here.  Not that I wouldn't.  I just...  Let me tell you what's going on here.  I'm very observant.  There's a minivan in Vegas with an XM unit.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  You got the wife at XM for Christmas, didn't you?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, we do have that.  I shall not see, nor shall I accept.  All the MySpace, like MySpace is some pussy shit, too.  But I just wanted to...  Is it...  I...  You know, I've been a fan of comedy since I've been doing comedy before that. 
[01:38:00]  Mm-hmm.  And I never thought of Brian...  Like, some of the major dudes I never thought of as come see me.  It's just like it was just constant, constant road, constant work, constant legitimacy,  and they just built a fucking fan base.  Well, that's nice of you to say.  I mean, I think if you just go out and kind of do pretty good shows, then people go, hey...  That's it.  Brian is a word-of-mouth guy over the years.  He's built up a following where if he comes to town, people just know about it.  And, again, families go, so it's not a niche audience. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  He didn't want to hear that again.  I'm sorry about that.  That just made me...  It's like, I've never heard two things.  Families.  Family and encore.  Families go.  Family, come on out to see Patrice.  You see, like, you know, old cotton candy, white-haired old ladies sitting there with, like,  a 14-year-old grandson, and they're all just having a great time.  And the CD he put out, I collect comedy CDs, is one of the best ones I've ever heard. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  One of the best ones I've ever heard.  Thank you very, very much.  Let's go to Raphael.  Much more important things to do from Connecticut.  Raphael, what do you want to do for the show today?  I am willing to take a mousetrap to the balls.  To the balls.  On your show, it's radio gold.  That is impossible.  Yeah, we're going to know if you're not taking it to the balls, my friend.  Dude, I'm going to do it in the studio.  I'll whip it right out on the console.  You know what? 
[01:39:30]  Holy Jesus, no.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  I swear to God, I'll come down and I'll do it.  How far are you from the station?  I've got to take the train.  I'm in Connecticut probably three hours, two hours.  Well, you should do it on the phone and then you should come in tomorrow when we're doing American Mess.  Okay.  Why?  Because you can't do it twice.  It's like pitching two days in a row.  If he does it on the phone today, he ain't taking a train in tomorrow to do it again.  But I don't want to lose this guy because I think he's going to bail on us. 
[01:40:00]  What do we do?  Do we have him do it now?  I don't have a mousetrap now.  Oh, okay.  No, he's got to come in.  I can't imagine.  Do you have a mallet?  I'll come in and you can do it live on Pal Talk for all your friends.  For Pal Talk.  Have you done this?  No.  Now, have you abused your nuts in any way even close to a mousetrap?  No.  Listen, I don't think anyone would ever say, I'm going to take a mousetrap to that area again. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, well, you bring up a good point there, Brian.  There's things in life you only do once.  The thing is, I think your nut is a lot like a mouse head.  Oh.  And the damage that can be done.  You ever see that mouse that had his head just smashed open by a mousetrap?  How about he just takes it to the bag?  Take it to the bag?  Like you stretch it out so that the actual testes aren't there but just the bag?  The old, what we like to call the old bat wing? 
[01:41:00]  See, we've got to hire a girl for this gay shit.  Because none of us really want to see this.  Broke back mousetrap.  This Friday.  Well, what, what, do you want something for that?  I mean, you would think that he would say, and then you give me a million dollars.  Ha, ha, a million dollars.  Exactly.  There's got to be an ending to that.  That's one of those conversations you have with your friends after smoking some pot.  Dude, for a million bucks, would you?  And people say no to that. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, that's like a completely incomplete thing to just say, I'll take a train in and get a mousetrap and do that.  And what?  And what do you want?  He doesn't want anything.  I don't want it.  You guys gave us, the listeners, enough over the years.  Wow.  He's the Jesus of fucking ballsack abuse.  You have given us.  I'll have the Romans hold me down.  I am taking a mousetrap to the nuts for the entire audience.  For everybody's enjoyment of the show. 
[01:42:00]  It's payback.  Well, we're going to have a party tomorrow, Raphael, if you want to come by.  I'm going to try to.  If not, we'll have to do it maybe next week sometime.  Any day you want to show up.  You don't even have to schedule an appointment.  Just show up.  Oh, you, my friend, have an open invite.  Right.  Thank you.  Thank you so much, gentlemen.  All right.  Now, does this guy have a calendar at home that has, like, you know, Friday, go to work, Saturday, family barbecue, Monday, take train into radio station with mousetrap in pocket? 
[01:42:30]  Tuesday, mom's birthday.  Tuesday, mom's birthday.  I'll have an anecdote to tell at the birthday party.  Funny you guys mentioned that.  My mother's birthday is on Sunday.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  He's crushing himself.  Your mother's birthday.  His nuts is in a jar on the fucking White Mills porch. 
[01:43:00]  May your testes get slammed in a mousetrap.  What better gift for mother?  Oh, God.  All right, sir.  Like we said.  One last thing, guys.  Howard Stern sucks ass.  Wow.  Suck Howard Stern.  That isn't very nice, is it, Brian?  All right.  Thank you, Raphael.  Yes, sir.  Let's go to Rob in New York.  We look forward to Raphael stopping by with his mousetrap soon.  Of course we do.  Rob, what's up? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, I went to see Brian when he lost his voice that night you guys went.  Okay.  I took my five kids, I played for the train fare, two drinks, and an appetizer apiece that  cost me $600 at Caroline's.  I was totally shocked.  What?  $600.  The five tickets, two recipes, and an appetizer apiece.  Yeah.  Wow.  Sounds like a complaint.  And like an idiot, I paid a 20% tip on it, forgetting that you don't tip on the entrance  tickets. 
[01:44:00]  So I gave the girl 60 bucks, and she was so smiley and happy.  Like, thank you, sir.  They should be tipped 60 bucks.  Well, I'm going to tell you in retrospect that when you pay that kind of money to see  Brian Regan, it is worth every penny.  Oh, there you go.  Thank you.  Oh.  That was the backup.  Wow.  That was going, man.  Another testimony of a nice guy.  I would have been saying, fuck you, that motherfucker, in the first five seconds.  I didn't ask you to come, bitch. 
[01:44:30]  You're a little kid for the fucking day.  I bet this ends happy.  He's not breathing, waiting for the alcohol.  I'm so fucking...  You know, I couldn't make my car payment.  I have to walk to work now.  I don't know if he did that on purpose or not, but man, that did not seem like it was  going to end that way.  No.  Then it turned it around.  It all came out forever, Rob.  I appreciate the words, man.  Remarkable.  He's remarkable.  Thank you.  President W.  $60.  Remarkable.  I've never seen a bad Brian Regan show. 
[01:45:00]  Never.  $60 is only 10%.  And it's a different show every time, too.  You said 20%, Mr. Manon.  I'm assuming 60 bucks at $600 was a shitty tip.  But, you know, it's good.  I slip the staff of Benjamin Franklin because the drinks just keep coming.  That's how you get them.  When one of the waitstaff comes over to your table early in the night, especially during  a Brian show because that place is packed, you hand them a Benjamin Franklin and say, 
[01:45:30]  Just keep them coming.  Keep them coming.  And you will get service that is unbelievable.  And it helps if you get to drink for free, too.  That, too.  Well, it happens to be this is more background comedy shit.  I, you know, I talk to the waitstaff and I say, well, who's your favorite people to  come in?  Mm-hmm.  Brian Regan.  Not because of him himself, but because his crowd tips.  Right.  The most.  I've heard that.  Then Janine Garofalo. 
[01:46:00]  Really?  His crowd is major tippers.  Nice.  What about like when Paul Mooney comes in?  Mooney's crowd is good tippers because they're, see, he draws these two black tippers.  I don't know why we got such a bad rap on tipping, but we, you either get us tipping  nothing or tipping 95%.  We, it's like, there's a, there's a compensation for those, for the, for the stigma that we  have for, for not tipping.  I tip, I tip like a white person.  I tip 20%. 
[01:46:30]  That's what I tip.  Well, that's unfair for you guys who are trying to compensate because you're trying to get  it to an average of 15 to 20.  So now you're just trying to average out at 10.  You gotta go.  At 90.  Yeah.  Well, if some are zero, then I gotta be above 20.  And as Paul goes, he looks for any, any excuse.  Bitch, I said two ice cubes.  Oh, do you even take into consideration service when you tip?  I, unless it's so extremely bad or so extremely good, it's, I just, I, I've had dinner with 
[01:47:00]  people like, uh, like you don't know that well.  And like, they try to like show you how assertive they are and they say, you know what, if we  get bad service, we don't tip, we leave nothing.  And we call the manager over and we complain to the manager about the waiter in front of  the waiter and I'm like, uh, remind me never to have dinner with you again because this  is just way too uncomfortable.  Dress them down.  I will leave, I will leave usually 20% if I never see the waiter ever. 
[01:47:30]  Right.  And then if it's good service, more on top of that.  Yeah.  I always round up.  I could not, uh, I could not leave less than 15.  I would, I would feel awkward.  And attitude plays no role in my, like attitude, nice attitude even makes me, I get sickened  at an overly happy waiter or waitress.  I just, just bringing my food, make sure everything's cool, make sure I'm eating.  I don't, hi and I'm, you know, Cindy and I'm, it's just like, eh, you know, because 
[01:48:00]  I like to be miserable too, you know what I mean?  I just want somebody in my zone, you know?  So I'm a, I'm, I'll tip 20%.  If they don't fucking smile at me, I like 20%, but they're good service.  I, uh, I tip 17% because I like to do the meth.  Oh, when you, when you go to an abacus, you go to some of the diners around Long Island,  especially in the community.  You see the calculators come out with the old ladies?  The community I live in is a predominantly Jewish area and they enjoy figuring out the 
[01:48:30]  tip and everyone, like four people at a booth at a diner and they all will have calculators  and papers and this one got this and percentages, they're doing a kind of, there was actually  a guy with one of those old ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ching adding machines with paper coming up.  No, just very, um, accurate with their tipping.  Accurate.  Very accurate.  Very accurate.  Accurate is a compliment.  Yes.  And you know, you got all those old, um, Mel's diner waitresses over there. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they just, all like the kiss my grits.  Hi, honey.  It's like Myrtle, you know, I ordered an hour and a half and go, oh, I forgot.  Yeah.  Oh, sweetie, we'll get that right out for you.  I read an article.  Do me a favor now.  About, about, uh, waiter and waitress tipping where it's been proven, they've done studies  that if a, usually a waitress, if she crouches down, so her head is at your level, she gets  more tips.  If she, um, if they give a friendly, if they give a good weather forecast, I'm not making 
[01:49:30]  that up.  Are you kidding?  If they, if they say, hey, it looks like a nice day out there.  With, like, maps and frontal charts.  Yeah, they have the green background screen.  And the pointer.  No, we got a barometric front moving in.  No, I heard that.  If they, if it's been proven for some reason that if they say, hey, it looks like a nice  day out there that that makes people tip more.  Wow.  Wow.  We interrupt this.  I have never heard of that.  Oh, he owns a midget sighting of the day. 
[01:50:00]  A midget sighting.  This is the third day in a row.  It's getting, uh, crazy with these midget sightings.  Uh, Crotch Critter.  Yeah.  Hey, how y'all doing?  Uh, very good.  What's up?  I got a midget sighting for y'all.  I was down in, uh, Knoxville, Tennessee last night at the, uh, the truck stop and, uh,  going in to pay for my fuel and all.  I go inside, get my, uh, little soda pop and whatever, walk up to the counter and I hear  this voice like, hey, I can help you over here.  I look around.  I'm like, what the hell is going on?  I look over.  If you, if you can imagine, this guy is like the alien on Men in Black that was standing 
[01:50:30]  behind the counter, uh, at the, what is it, doing a shop or whatever with, you know,  they had all the guns.  Yeah.  This guy, his head is small, his chest is small, but he's got regular legs, regular  arms.  Holy shit.  And yeah, he, oh my God, it was, it was so, the whole time I, Anthony, I went ahead and  I emailed the video to you.  I videotaped it on my, on my cell phone.  Wow.  The whole time I'm sitting there fucking laughing and the guy's just like looking at me like,  I know this guy's laughing at me, but the whole thing I was like, oh my God, these 
[01:51:00]  guys are going to die when they see this shit.  And it was so funny.  His hands, his arms look like they're eight feet long just because, you know, in proportion  to his body.  Oh my God, it was so, and he had like regular pants on me, like regular size pants.  Regular size pants.  Oh, that's creepy.  And you got a video that you sent in?  Yeah, I sent it to, uh, to Anthony last night.  But I mean, it was, it was hilarious.  Hopefully I'll be able to find it in my multitude of, uh, email.  All right, Crouch Critter.  All right, man. 
[01:51:30]  Y'all have a good one.  Thank you.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  So, tipping, yeah.  All right, we'll take a break.  Brian Regan this year.  Tickets still remain for his Sunday show at Carolines.  We're going to play like a Brian Regan bit so you don't have to do heavy lifting today.  All right.  You do the hang and then we play some of your funny stuff that you've done in the past.  Actually, I think it's something you did with, uh, somebody from, from another XM show.  A bit called, uh, which one are we doing?  Oh, Inventions.  I know this one. 
[01:52:00]  Let's play this as we go to break.  God damn, is that funny.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Breaking into the music because we only have Brian Regan for a little while.  Well, he's off to some kind of, I don't know, wholesome meeting with a network, I believe.  I'm sure.  Playing Carolines all weekend long.  And Patrice was just having a little, uh, conversation with one of the Pal Talk girls. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  She's Malaysian.  Delicious.  We just noticed that one of the guys on Pal Talk, he's got his webcam in his car,  so we're just watching him drive to work, I guess.  Well, I, I assume he's a trucker and, uh, he's just on the road.  He just went through a toll booth and stuff, and I was kind of curious as to how they were doing that.  And apparently it's a laptop and Verizon service, which, uh, you know, you're able to broadcast your webcam from the road.  We should dare that guy to rob a bank.  We could watch the getaway. 
[01:53:00]  Be right in there with him.  The getaway ride, you know.  That can be exciting.  It is amazing what the technology, because when you look back to the past,  this type of technology would have been like, yes, it'll be used for conferencing of big businesses,  um, grandma keeping in touch with the grandchildren, uh, coast to coast, like that, um, uh,  any, anything but this girl, uh, deep-throating a dildo, a guy commuting to work,  and Patrice sexually harassing a Malaysian girl. 
[01:53:30]  It's just, we take the, the best technology and just bring it down to the lowest level possible.  Like satellites involved, you know, like hundreds of millions of dollars of technology.  Of technology.  Let me see your tits.  So that it all boils down to.  You're on the other side of the world.  Put your shirt up.  Put your, put your tits out.  I felt so, I just, I couldn't resist it. 
[01:54:00]  I'm suing for mental, and it's like, bitch, you could have just said no.  XM had to get a satellite into orbit so we could play Guess What's in My Pants today.  Guess What's in My Pants.  Yeah.  In order for all of you to hear a chicken be fucked by a German gentleman,  millions upon millions, perhaps billions of dollars,  NASA had to get involved.  Rocket ships.  Rocket ships were used.  They must be proud of us today in Washington.  Let's go down to Anita, the trucker. 
[01:54:30]  Anita.  Yes.  I'm a 60-year-old mother of two, grandmother of eight.  My son gave me an XM radio for Christmas.  My youngest son drives a truck also.  He's on his way to Fenton, Missouri, as a matter of fact.  He called me at 7 o'clock this morning and woke me up so I could hear your chicken thing.  They gave me this radio with the promise that I would listen to you guys one time.  Yeah.  And it's like looking at a train wreck. 
[01:55:00]  You know, you don't really want to do it, but you do it anyway.  Yeah, we understand.  We've actually described the show like that quite a few times.  Have you really?  But I listen to you guys almost all the time now.  I think you are the funniest things I've ever heard.  I feel like I have to take a shower afterwards sometimes.  You know, this woman really is summing up this program.  Very good.  Yeah.  Is she the one that's driving that truck on the lower left?  No, she's another person, Anita. 
[01:55:30]  I'm in Fort Madison, Wisconsin, or Fort Madison, Iowa, waiting for a load right now.  Would you ever do something crazy for our radio show?  It would depend on what it would be.  Keep listening.  There's many things you could do for the show.  A guy's going to take a mousetrap to his ball sack tomorrow.  I know.  I heard that.  He's got to be an idiot.  Motherly advice.  We might need a call in every once in a while with the motherly advice.  Let's hope that isn't one of your two kids.  Yeah, really. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, no.  I'd kill him if it was.  You know, I made that body, and it's a good bid.  Mom, the trucker.  Yeah.  Hey, you must be in good shape for 60 years old to be a trucker.  Yeah, pretty good.  Yeah, you got big arms on you?  Large Marge.  Mom, Mom, my girlfriend left me.  What do I do?  Get over it, spaggot!  Yeah.  Double clutching with her suppos.  I didn't raise no pussies! 
[01:56:30]  All right.  Keep her between the ditches there, Anita.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Y'all take care.  Call us from time to time, and keep us honest, all right?  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Remember the time we found, like, a 70-something-year-old stripper?  Yeah.  She used to strip for us?  Mm-hmm.  And then we took her to road shows and stuff?  Yeah, what the hell?  I forgot her name.  Damn.  Yeah, we're not talking about Sandy Kane.  No, no, no. 
[01:57:00]  Oof.  This lady really thought she still had it going on, and she was still stripping at 70-something.  Well, she probably turned 71 and retired.  Yeah.  Wasn't there something with diapers involved with that show?  Diapers?  Kind of remembering a diaper being involved.  Maybe.  You never know.  No.  Let's go to George.  It's a little blur, man.  I know.  George in Jersey.  How are you guys?  All right, George.  Listen, Brian, I got a wage of complaints about your shows.  Okay.  I took my entire family to the show. 
[01:57:30]  We laughed so hard that we hurt the next day.  Hey.  Oh, look at that.  That ended nice, too.  That ended well.  The hell of a complaint.  There's no way to fucking...  Hey, Regan!  Yeah, what's up?  I came to your fucking show, and somebody stabbed me in the eye with a fucking pen.  Yeah, and what happened?  Man, I laughed my other eye out.  Thanks!  Motherfucker, come to my show.  Oh, dude, Patrice. 
[01:58:00]  Holy shit, man.  Let me tell you.  You make me fucking sick.  Brian, I was at your show the other day, and it was hysterical.  We all had a great time, me and my family, and we stayed late, and as you left, you backed  over one of our children and killed him.  But, you know, you signed something for me, the police report, so I got an autograph, and  it really was a funny show, and we do have other kids.  So, actually, now the other kids get more food, so you've helped our family out, and I can't 
[01:58:30]  thank you enough for that.  Killing our kid.  You rule, Brian.  You rule.  Fucking guys.  Hey, Regan.  Flattered.  Doesn't matter.  I'm flattered.  Hey, Regan.  I love you, man.  Oh, man.  Let's go to Arizona.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey, Dave.  Hey, you're giving Patrice crap about not having a website.  Yeah.  I'm on it right now.  It says, bandwidth limit exceeded. 
[01:59:00]  That's what Dave told us.  That's an excellent promotion he's got going on.  Wait, so ten people clicked on your website at one time and can't handle the traffic?  That's what happened.  Hey, listen.  I just made a call.  He did.  You saw me make an executive call.  Oh, he made it.  He's like, what's with the...  No, here was Patrice's call, though.  Yeah.  I need more width as far as that band goes.  Whatever the band is, it needs more width.  It's going to be wider.  Because I ain't got enough of the width on the band, so... 
[01:59:30]  And I swear, that was his call.  Yeah.  And then he's asking me, he's like, Anthony, how much bandwidth do I need?  And I'm like, I don't know.  Two, three, maybe?  Ten gigs a month.  I go, no one goes there unless it gets spiked by us talking about it.  So, like, ten gigs a month.  And he goes, how's 100 gigs a month?  I go, that's more than you're ever going to need.  It's getting fixed, everybody.  Don't worry.  I didn't know about bands.  We can give you the Dane Cook plan of eight gazillion gigabytes. 
[02:00:00]  A day.  There's, yeah.  Dane's server has, like, spinning tapes like the old science fiction movies.  Just that one guy spiked it.  I don't know.  What?  What happened?  Batrice has a Commodore 64 in a bedroom somewhere.  Batrice, I went to your site.  It was great.  I was playing Star Raiders. 
[02:00:30]  Rick the Trucker.  Rick.  Hey.  Hey.  Guys, how you doing?  Good, man.  Love the show.  It's fucking great.  I travel all over the country.  I think it's the best thing going.  Yeah, I think so.  I think we're blowing up.  Batrice, I want to let you know, man, I haven't seen either you or Mr. Reagan, but I'll tell you,  you got me fucking laughing on this road so much.  Mr. Reagan.  Man, I just want to pat you on the back, my friend.  Look at him.  All right.  You don't even know, Brian.  Yeah, I don't even know.  And he still said he got a great show.  Hey, listen, Batrice, I heard of you, but I don't know this Mr. Reagan, but I'm definitely 
[02:01:00]  going to go to your show.  Why?  Good for you, man.  Mommy, why are there instructions on Pop-Tarts?  Will?  Oh, I love that.  Will, a cup of dirt.  God, I just want to be loved one year.  I'm going to just practice on being loved one year.  I just want to know what it's like.  I just want to know what it's like.  It's fucking so amazing, dude.  That's what it's like.  Look at him.  Get some bandwidth.  Yeah, man.  You know, we just start loving it.  Get some bandwidth, man.  Your website could take more than three hits. 
[02:01:30]  Dumb idiot.  After the show, I'd be like, all right, Brian's like, I'm out of here, motherfuckers.  One.  What?  Peace out, bitches.  There's something to be said about playing it safe, I think.  That's what we're all learning today.  If you make it fucking...  Maybe we shouldn't be pissing off every single person out there.  And we'll get some love, too.  Unbelievable, man.  I'm a bridge-burning idiot.  We all are.  That's why we get along.  What's with that cut, Lindsay Lohan?  What?  What?  What did she do?  I'm not going to ever work with her.  Seems like a nice girl. 
[02:02:00]  That's what I'm going to say now.  Seems like a nice enough girl.  You know, I wish her the best.  And he's funny doing it.  It's like anybody that you would think, you would just go, oh, God, Mr. Nice Guy.  But it's almost just...  We had this discussion at N.E.W. where it was like, hey, Brian, that ain't all Hitler.  You know, what a bastard, that guy.  Yeah, yeah, but a well-trimmed moustache on that guy.  He says something.  Always, I never saw it overgrowing.  He was a good artist.  Maybe if someone would have bought a painting from him, that could have... 
[02:02:30]  Turned his life around.  Averted a lot of hurt.  If somebody would have bought some of his artwork, he wouldn't have been so frustrated.  Did Regan just do a G-rated Hitler joke?  How the fuck did that happen?  Let's go to Nick in Canada.  Nick?  How are you guys doing?  All right, Nick.  Oh, Brian, I tell you what, you are so funny, you make me throw up.  It's hilarious.  And Patrice, you're okay, too.  There you go.  Well, here's some love.  Here's Theo in Virginia.  Theo. 
[02:03:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Patrice, I saw you last year down here in Virginia.  Oh, the last time you toured?  Like, six couples were getting pissed off.  It was right around Christmas time.  He was bitching everybody out about their Christmas sweaters and stuff.  And, like, seriously, like, six couples got up and laughed so hard.  It killed me.  It was my favorite comedic performance I've ever watched.  I've been chasing people away from the show.  I average 15 a show.  They just want to go to your show with their Christmas sweaters.  And I go, fucking leave.  Just leave. 
[02:03:30]  We don't want you here.  He's sitting there with their little Alpine sweaters on.  Yeah.  Like, Grandma got him for Christmas.  It's like they'd wear him out.  That's why, and this is last year.  That's why, comics rotate, what do you rotate, three a year in a club or two a year?  Yeah, like two, three a year.  Two or three.  Or three.  Yeah, or three.  This guy, this was a year and some change ago I was in Virginia.  I don't rotate.  And I'm not trying to get him out.  It's just I'm doing my shit.  It's just I'm going to just go, fuck.  Like, this guy in Cleveland goes, it was right when the Abu Ghraib thing comes out. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  You know what, give me a break.  I don't give a shit about no naked Arabs, right?  So the guy stands up and goes, that's fucked up.  You know, my son's over there.  And I said, look, you got a yachting shirt on you.  Couldn't you send him to Canada?  And I hate to take just 20 people left.  Oh, wow.  Can you get him out of that shit?  You was rich, motherfucker.  Wow.  You got a yachting shirt off.  Based on his yachting shirt. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, what is that?  Can you pay somebody to get your son out of this mess?  I picture a collar and blue and white stripes.  It was 1-0.  Was it?  Yachting and he stood up by the air.  With a little, like, sailboat where an Izod emblem would be.  And that's when I got thrown out.  They marched out.  And after that show, the gentleman comes over and goes, oh, yeah, yeah.  And, like, she said, yeah, as if she already told me she fired me for the weekend.  She just came over first.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[02:05:00]  So, anyway, anyhow.  Yeah, like, we all know where this went.  I don't even have to say it, Patrice.  You are so gone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, here's your check.  I got to break in.  Matt in New York City, what do you want to do?  Take the mousetrap off of the sack.  Right now.  Right now.  How far are you from the station?  I'm on 41st and 8th.  Oh, my God.  Off of the sack. 
[02:05:30]  Look, I don't like getting into details about men's genitalia.  Okay.  Well, when I don't have to.  However, there is a couple of stipulations, though.  All right.  What's the stipulations you have?  You've got the million-dollar thing in mind.  No, no, no.  Not at all.  Not at all.  What do you want from us?  I've been trying to get tickets for Brian Regan.  Oh, Brian.  You've got to help out the show, Brian.  We can.  Look at Brian.  Yeah.  You want to see Brian? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Here's what you're going to do, though.  That's going to be a first.  Dude, here's what you're going to do.  Okay.  You're going to, hopefully, you're not cold or nervous, because that makes the scrotum  pull up.  Well, let's just say I'm a construction guy, and I've been outside.  All right.  What he needs to do, I think, is stretch the bottom of his bag.  Yeah.  We've got to be responsible for broadcasting.  Over the edge of the trap.  Right.  So no testy is involved.  Right.  So that no testy gets hit.  Why is Brian taking notes? 
[02:06:30]  For the lawsuit later?  Of course.  Right.  I don't know.  I wrote down cold and nervous for some reason.  Cold and nervous.  Game rules.  Makes it like it would be hard for him to pull.  He actually pulled out of bed.  So he should bring in a space heater and some painkiller.  Right.  Exactly.  Take care of that situation.  I'm thinking, yeah, we turn the heat up and a Xanax.  Yeah.  Then where he's not nervous and it's no cold bag.  Then that's not an issue.  Now you stretch as much of your bag over the business end of the mousetrap without a testy 
[02:07:00]  being in the strike zone, right?  Yeah.  That's fair.  And then you hit the trigger.  It smashes down on your sack.  Thanks for being so graphic.  Well, I like to let you know what you're getting yourself into, my friend.  Right.  Thank you.  Or you can take it on the head.  No, no.  That's okay.  Yeah, by the way, I'd like to take this opportunity to plug, if you pick up the daily news today 
[02:07:30]  in New York City, it's a story about Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony's not-so-dirty little secret about how we're not in the gutter these  days and we're doing some fun, creative, clever, not-dirty radio.  You have like a lot of new listeners tuning in.  Yeah, because they saw this article and go, finally, a satellite radio talk show I could  listen to because it's not-so-dirty.  And they're in this mousetrap concert.  Mousetrap on the scrotum.  So pick up your daily news today.  Pick it up.  It's a wonderful little feature on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  Matt, come on down.  Okay.  Let's trust me, Will.  Come on down.  Okay, I'll be there.  What is the obvious again?  All right, hold on the line.  All right.  We might have a taker.  I think Matt's coming down to take a mousetrap to the sack for some Brian Regan tickets.  Jeez, amazing.  We'll see how long it's going to take him.  What are we looking at?  The Isaiah.  I just put a mustache and a beard on that chick.  That's Latrell Springfield.  Holy crap.  It looks just like Latrell.  Why would fucking Isaiah fuck with her? 
[02:08:30]  Well, if she had that, Cote, I don't think you would.  Well, that's the big story here in New York.  Isaiah Thomas being accused of sexual harassment.  It looks like bullshit, doesn't it, Patrice?  Fucking ass me.  Yeah, look, Patrice.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  Yeah, it's always bullshit.  It's always bullshit.  Well, you had a great comment about that in the office saying, look, Isaiah Thomas, if  he's going down that road, he's telling 11s to go home.  He's telling 12s to beat it. 
[02:09:00]  I just could have happened as they say, whatever.  If he's going to play that game, why would he do it with someone right in the office?  Why?  And someone that looks like that.  Come on.  Stop playing.  Stop it.  That's a non-story.  Stop it.  She got fired for whatever, and now she's a little bitter, and she's going down the old  sexual harassment road.  Six million dollars for that.  For that.  No.  No.  What do you think, Pat?  Well, you know, it's just an accusation.  How can you put that on the front page if, you know what I mean?  No, it's the best part about that. 
[02:09:30]  That's an accusation.  It's on the front page.  It'll be proven that this is all bullshit, and it'll be a tiny, tiny little article on  page 81.  You know, he can't, he can't, you know, he says, he says no, and that doesn't mean anything.  It's just an accusation.  I think it's unfair.  Wow.  Then again, she might have a full stand.  She might have a point.  Brian had to take a sip of water after that one.  It's like, shit.  That was some old political shit.  Let me back off. 
[02:10:00]  Let me back off that female audience with that statement.  Hello, Nickelodeon.  I didn't mean it.  The bitch wanted it.  That's something you'll never hear.  She wanted it.  She was asking for it.  You'll never hear that out of Brian Regan.  Hey, we got Jim Cook checking in.  Celebrity impersonation.  We got Jim Cook checking in, Anthony, from Sam Adams.  He has some advice for Brian, some advice for Brian Regan. 
[02:10:30]  Jim Cook.  Yeah, Brian, I just wanted to say, giving away those tickets could have a negative effect  on your career.  I'd advise against it.  Well, that's a pretty good Jim Cook, my friend.  Unless it's really Jim Cook.  Just from the voice, I know who this guy is.  Who is it?  You want to bet me $10?  No, because you're a genius when it comes to this.  You want to bet me $10?  No.  Is this Dave?  All right, I'll bet you the $10 you still owe me.  Oh, yeah, I do.  That's what everyone saw on PalTalk. 
[02:11:00]  That's what's good about PalTalk.  They see the financial exchange that goes by.  There's $10.  I gave it right back to you.  I did forget about that.  You want to bet that $10, though, right now?  No, because you win.  Why?  Because you know you're like an idiot savant when it comes to the name thing.  This guy called in to do a Jim Cook impression, but I know who he is.  Come on, $5.  I got $5.  No, because I know you'll win.  Five down.  You know me.  I'm down for a bet, but I'm not down for a sucker bet ever.  That's a sucker bet.  He hasn't said anything. 
[02:11:30]  It's a sucker bet.  You never, ever missed these.  Is there any way I can know who this guy is, right?  No one had told me anything.  No one passed me a note.  Dude.  Just by hearing his voice.  It's your track record I'm going on.  Take it as a compliment and put your five away.  I'm not betting you.  Well, I'm not telling you who it is, then.  It's going to cost you five bucks for me to tell you.  Take it as a compliment that he won't win any money.  Take it as a compliment.  No doubt in my mind, this is Dave the Blind Guy.  You got it.  Wow.  This is Blind Dave or Dave the Blind Guy?  Blind Dave, actually. 
[02:12:00]  Hey, you can check out my band's website, Pulserox.net.  He's actually completely blind, Brian.  Yeah?  And now you're doing a band thing?  I've been in a band for a while now.  This guy has given us some of the best radio ever.  I think we have him on stage performing, being blind and walking on the stage, Opie.  Oh, yes.  Thank you, Anthony.  And performing a song.  So subtle, aren't we? 
[02:12:30]  Wait, we want to give you some props today.  Yeah.  I haven't made the transition.  I've been stepping back, letting a pat from Unaki's and whatnot step up the bat.  Nah.  Dude, your track record speaks for itself.  Some of the things this guy did.  We found a girl, Brian.  We actually played the bit yesterday on the show.  Yeah.  We played again going into break or something.  We found a girl that could toss eggs from her, from her vag.  Yeah.  She was able to shoot eggs out.  It's one of these bachelor things.  You know, you hire her for a bachelor party and she can watch them, I don't know, 10, 12 
[02:13:00]  feet.  Yeah.  Something like that.  So then we had Blind Dave in front of her with a basket trying to catch the eggs.  So when you're booking somebody like this, you have to factor in the cost of a dozen eggs?  Well, it's in the budget for the show.  Hey, can I say Mammoth Road Club in Drake It on February 18th and Pub 30th in Chelmsford  on March 10th.  What do you do for the band?  I'm a drummer.  Drake It where?  Massachusetts?  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, he's up there.  He's up there.  He's the blind drummer.  Have you been blind since birth?  No.  He lost it, man.  About like nine years ago.  In an accident or?  No, it's a retina disease.  Oh, man.  He actually holds a driver's license.  Yeah, I never got it renewed.  I didn't make it in time.  No?  No, we had you renew it on the show that time, no?  Yeah, but it's a while ago. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, we've been off the air for a while.  He actually went in and faked it right there in motor vehicle.  He went up to the counter and faked the eye to the whole thing.  I got a year to try it again.  And walked away as a blind man with a driver's license.  He had a friend help him out.  Yeah.  Explain it again, because we have a whole new audience, Dave.  All right.  I put like a back brace on, and I got a crippled cane, and I had this chick come with me.  And you don't have to take an eye test in Connecticut. 
[02:14:30]  And I told them I was in a car accident.  They let me ahead of the people ahead of me.  And I told them my glasses got busted in the accident, and I'm waiting on a new pair.  Could they get my hand to where I had to sign?  So they actually had to move his hand where he had a sign on the page.  That's how he got away with that.  Yeah.  And then you had to get a picture taken, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  My dumb smiling face. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, so he kind of just walked and just...  Yeah, and so it was like it was crippled, but were you using the cane, like, to kind of sweep the floor?  I had the girl look like she was helping me walk.  I told him I'd, like, hurt my back and my ribs.  But he's blind.  This guy has the best sense of humor.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  And then, finally, for the new listeners, one of our greatest bits ever, when we really didn't give a shit,  we did blind boxing with Dave and this guy, Matt, from Long Island.  And everyone's like, you know, we knew Dave was blind, and we're like, hey, Matt, how do we know you're blind? 
[02:15:30]  He popped his eyes out.  Oh, yeah.  Kicked my ass.  And then he proceeded to kick Dave's ass in this blind boxing match.  We've got to get those clipped up again.  I think Dave would have done better if he wasn't so drunk.  Yeah.  You were so hammered, and they're boxing, and it was really disturbing to watch because at one point they were back-to-back.  Right.  Like, completely opposite direction.  Punching.  And kind of throwing jabs out and searching for each other. 
[02:16:00]  The rock-em-sag-em robots.  Completely facing the opposite direction.  I had back surgery two months after that.  Well, what were your injuries, by the way?  I think I cracked some ribs and bruised my kidney or something.  Spleen, I think.  Spleen, I don't know.  Yeah.  Oh, this other blind guy beat the shit out of him.  We didn't think this all the way through, and he got beat up pretty good.  I'm just curious.  Could you drum before you lost your sight?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was drumming on and off since I was a kid, but I was kind of hammered for a while. 
[02:16:30]  I haven't drank in, like, three years now.  Dude, why'd you give it up?  It's great.  I know.  I kind of, you know, I had fun with it.  I'm not AA about it or anything like that, though, you know.  Oh, good.  There's beer in my refrigerator.  I hate when they reform.  I don't buy the disease shit.  Like, I can't give up being blind.  Right.  Yeah, if you could go to, like, Blind Anonymous.  Yeah.  And then, you know, hey, it's my, I'm on my third month of seeing. 
[02:17:00]  And everyone, like, applauds.  It's great.  Pat on the back, like, yeah, you stopped being a fuck-up.  Well, that's good, because I don't think drinking was doing too good for you.  Some people can really handle it, and other people are like Dave.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Dave.  All right.  It's good hearing from you.  All right, thanks, guys.  Pulserox.net.  And where's the gigs again?  February 18th at the Mammoth Road Club in Dracut and March 10th at Pub 30 in Chelmsford. 
[02:17:30]  Right on.  All right, keep in touch.  Thanks, guys.  Blind Dave, everyone.  The band just tells them they're at a club.  They just hang out in the basement.  Jesus.  Play.  All right, and we got to get Brian Regan out of here?  Or do you want to wait for the mousetrap guy now?  What?  I'll be honest.  I'll be honest.  When he went to break, he said he's got to get out of here, so I don't want to put the  pressure on him.  Right.  So if you have to leave, we understand. 
[02:18:00]  How close was the guy?  Yeah, where is he?  Do we have his cell number?  Can we find out how close the guy is?  More radio, Brian?  Hmm?  More radio?  No, I flew in last night, this morning.  So he wants to sleep.  Yeah, he's got to sleep.  Rack out.  Wants to sleep and get ready for the show.  All right.  But if there's a...  Why don't you tell the listeners what hotel you're staying at?  They'll lull you to sleep.  Do they take care of you, Caroline?  Do they take care of you nicely?  Not money-wise, just like extras.  I get two free beers every night.  No, no, no.  Not the money like the hotel and stuff. 
[02:18:30]  Fly you in first class and things like that?  It's all good, yeah.  Oh, they must just take care of him.  Good club, man.  Good club.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, the guy, I guess he's on his way.  I don't know.  We could take a break, and if it takes too long, maybe Brian will be here.  Maybe he won't.  We'll leave it up to Brian.  Brian, if you have to go, that's fine.  If you want to stay and hang out, you are so welcome to just hang out.  All right, I'll play it by ear.  There you go.  I don't think either one of them was like, you're passive-aggressive, you better stay. 
[02:19:00]  It was not a passive-aggressive, you better stay.  You gave him an offer, you can't refuse.  He can stay and be cool, or you can go run and go to fucking sleep.  Yeah, pussy.  We heard it.  I certainly didn't hear that in my tone.  It wasn't an even tone.  Like, hey, dude, you can hang, or you can go.  It's cool, man.  That's what I heard in my headphones.  You can stay, or you can fucking get the shit out of here.  Did I, play the tape back, Derek.  Did I woo?  Did I say woo? 
[02:19:30]  I don't think so.  We heard you.  Ow!  Yeah.  Ow!  We heard you.  We both heard you.  It was uncomfortable.  Very weird.  He just took an uncomfortable sip of water.  Brian can do whatever he wants.  That's what a crowd member does when you pick him out of the crowd.  He starts to drink a little water.  He's just like, shit, did this motherfucker just make me stay?  Oh, no, no.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah, I gotta go.  Hey, I heard someone told us you gotta go.  You gotta go.  You gotta fucking go forever, nigga.  One day your shows won't be sold out all the time, Mr. Reagan. 
[02:20:00]  Reagan.  What's up, Steve?  Yes, Steve?  Steve?  What?  Oh, nothing.  We were just getting the paperwork ready for Ball Smash Guy.  He's going to have to have a pile of paperwork.  Legal said, oh, sure, but he's got to sign a waiver.  Is he coming with his attorney?  I don't believe so.  Are we going to negotiate a contract before?  The testicle in question is not at the proper angle of, let's, there's a rider on this contract. 
[02:20:30]  Heretofore known as heretofore.  Heretofore, right.  All right, we're going to figure it all out next.  How's that?  Good.  Brian Reagan, still some tickets available for Sunday show at Caroline's.  That's the last show.  All the rest of them are sold out.  212-757-4100.  We'll go to break with Brian Reagan doing his thing.  All right, we've got lots going on. 
[02:21:00]  Brian Reagan has decided to stay a little longer.  The guys are waiting for the mousetrap guy to show up.  They're all just kind of waiting at the door.  As soon as he gets here, we're going to get him in here to take a mousetrap to the ball bag for Brian Reagan tickets.  Patrice O'Neill's website is back up and running. 
[02:21:30]  All right, with new bandwidth.  With new bandwidth.  New bandwidth up in this motherfucker.  Let's see how long that lasts.  I got mad bandwidth.  You have no idea what you've got.  We're going to see how much you've got in a few minutes here.  Patrice O'Neill dot com.  20 gigahits or something?  Are you crazy?  You got like mega dirt on there?  You got like 100 gigs.  I don't know what you guys are talking about.  I think you were talking about houses, which we'll get into in a second. 
[02:22:00]  But Patrice O'Neill, he was on the show recently saying how his mom answers his fan mail, right?  Yeah, not anymore, unfortunately, because you blew up your mom's spot by admitting it on the show.  Just talking to my big mom.  Yeah, my mom does it.  And then these cocksuckers, you know.  I'm like, Ma, don't do it with my mail.  Don't do it no more.  She says, why?  It's not right.  It was a nice little job for her.  She feels like she's part of your career.  Part of my career.  It's exciting for her to see what people think of her son.  I had to fire my mother anyway.  I paid her just because I love her and she's my mother. 
[02:22:30]  And it's like, she was typing, somebody would go, dude, I saw you at this and you were the greatest.  And then she would go, thanks for your cooperation.  Just stuff you would never write back, right?  I was like, moms, I wouldn't even say that to some fucking asshole.  But these idiot stars did.  Hey, hey, let me see your snatch, lady.  It's like, oh, I'm like, moms, moms, get off of there.  So now I answer my own fucking emails.  I look at them and shit.  Now, how did you fire her? 
[02:23:00]  Did you have to bring her in and sit her down and sit her down?  Yeah, don't worry.  I said, don't worry about it.  Just don't worry about it.  And then send her a check.  One thing I love about my mother, she just, if I was a drug dealer, she wouldn't be one of those fucking, oh, Lord, the devil's money.  She'd be like, thank you so much.  Yeah, yeah.  Put it right in the fucking bra.  Wouldn't be like Scarface's mother.  Get down.  You are evil.  None of that shit.  She'd be like, oh, it's 10,000.  Be careful.  Don't get shot in the face, baby.  So she'd just take money. 
[02:23:30]  My mother takes money to just be quiet.  I got a communique from Iraq.  Urgent communique.  Matt is here doing paperwork.  Wow.  All right.  There we go.  See what radio has come down to.  We used to just do this stuff.  Now they have to sign a million documents just to enter the facility.  And then a whole bunch of other documents to come into the studio.  So he's going to come here and just, like, stand right over there and do this live? 
[02:24:00]  Close to the pal talk camera.  I think, unfortunately, I'm going to take one for the team.  I'm going to move over here.  Okay.  But I think the prime location.  Why are you putting your hand on Brian Regan's lap?  I wanted to touch Brian.  I'm going to slide over this way.  I think in this general area.  It was the prime location for this.  Oh, make sure it was ball to drive.  Ball to sweat.  Don't snap off.  All you had to do is tell Brian that he needs to move, Anthony. 
[02:24:30]  That was...  He's moving it right here on this corner.  What?  Right here.  That's where he has to do it?  Yeah, that's where he'll do it.  All right.  So we're setting up the camera, the webcam for all the pal talk users today.  All right.  Ball Avenue is what we'll call that spot right now.  You know what?  But then I want it wiped down very well with all kinds of Lysol.  This guy's going to have a folder with these legal documents that his grandkids are going  to find up in an attic 40 years from now. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  Let's take a...  Hey, we can even move the camera closer.  I got some slack.  Yeah, why don't we do that?  Let's go to Russ in New York City.  We'll give him a whole different angle of the studio.  That'll be fun.  Beauty.  Russ, New York City, what's up?  Hey, I just want to let you guys know, I saw Brian in September at Caroline's.  Yeah.  Went to the Sunday night show.  It was the Wednesday before I had buried my mom.  She died.  And Brian was so funny.  I was laughing really loud. 
[02:25:30]  I felt really embarrassed, you know, like I was really a jerk.  And I looked at my daughter, who I took away.  She was laughing really hard, too.  So either he's real funny or we're just a real sick family.  But it was just a great show.  Well, I'm glad you had fun, man.  Sorry about your mom.  Thank you.  All right.  That's a strange phone call.  Hi, Russ.  Is that Matt right there outside the studio?  Did he sign all?  Is he still signing?  He's all done.  He's all done.  That is the most bizarre looking camera I've ever seen.  It looks like it belongs in some futuristic space movie. 
[02:26:00]  It is the Orbit cam.  You can move it around with these controls.  See?  That was wild.  There you go.  Yeah.  And you could zoom in.  But it's digital zoom, so it kind of stinks.  There's Patrice right there.  And then since I have it on my hand, I could just kind of turn it with my hand.  Without having to push the button.  Without having to push the button.  But that's not as much futuristic fun, is it?  You could just turn it.  I like it.  Watch when I press the button.  Yeah.  Futuristic fun.  And here's what I look at. 
[02:26:30]  That's my screen.  And it hovers when I lift it off the table.  And there's, you know, my personal mail, which you can look at, people.  Thank you.  Don't take a screenshot of that.  Opie, finally.  We get to see Opie on the Pal Talk cam.  Oh, stop it.  That's where Opie works.  You have like one of those half masks on.  Steve C., E-Rock, Patrice, and Brian. 
[02:27:00]  I see the curtains are down.  So we're ready to broadcast.  We're ready to broadcast.  He's still doing paperwork.  And here's our view out the window of New York City.  There it is for the people watching at home.  Mousetrap guy, yeah?  All right, yeah, let's bring him in.  See what he's about.  Let's bring him in.  His name's Matt, I think.  There he is.  Hey, man.  Jesus, Matt.  How you doing?  You're nuts.  I know, I'm crazy. 
[02:27:30]  Dude.  You don't know.  This isn't something like you can do a test run on.  This is, you're going to just find out what this feels like now.  That's all right.  Have a little fun.  You've got like stone guy's eyes.  A little fun.  Well, you've got to take a couple of painkillers.  Maybe.  Oh, my God.  All right, disqualified.  There will be drug testing.  Drug testing.  Right.  The whole point is to feel the pain.  You know, it's going to ruin the sport for the kids.  He just sits there and laughs maniacally after they snap. 
[02:28:00]  If the kids hear about this and you become one of their heroes and you find out drugs are involved, that could be a problem.  That's okay.  We want this to be official.  I don't think painkillers kick in.  Like, I think you have to have pain first.  Look at them.  I just ran from the...  He started the painkilling process a few hours ago.  Look at them.  Yeah.  Like pins.  Right.  Yikes.  And remember, this is something that he said he wanted to do. 
[02:28:30]  He came up with this idea.  I don't want people thinking that I said...  Thank you.  Here's how you can get Brian Regan tickets.  Brian Regan, Esquire.  You want Brian Regan tickets.  Just ass.  Brian has destroyed a young man's balls.  The Honorable Brian Regan.  I hope that was one of the many documents you had to sign to come in here to make it clear that...  There's got 20 of them.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, emergency numbers scared me a little, too.  This is where it gets awkward because it's just a bunch of guys.  We don't even know how to begin talking about this.  That is okay.  Yeah.  Usually I'm a great setup man, but... 
[02:29:00]  That is the problem with having an unbalanced sexual office and make sure no...  This is the most...  Make sure there's not going to be a harassment suit office in the whole fucking world.  All right.  Right.  Well, um...  Who wants to be the guy that just tells Matt what he needs to do?  By the way, now that I have more slack, he could be further away from me.  Well, Matt, you have to go in this...  Kind of where Patrice is.  Where?  See that little nub on the console?  That is where he's going to do his handiwork.  I don't give a shit.  This chair has fucking wheels. 
[02:29:30]  I'm rolling where the balls ain't.  All right.  Step over this.  Anthony is placing the webcam in a better position for Matt.  All right.  Let's leave it right...  So the people on PalTalk, you get a nice little treat today.  I do have to use the little buttons for a minute.  E-Rock's got to move his gut out of the way.  Can I see it snap at least first?  Yeah, you can see it snap.  Take one with the hand first.  It's horrible, man.  Take one with the hand just to see what you're in it for. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah?  Not with the fingers.  Go like this.  How's that, guys?  Good?  Yeah, like that.  Take one with the hand.  You're going to scare him off with this.  No, not there.  I swear to God, not there.  I'm not even fucking around.  The meat.  Take it on the meat.  There you go.  Take it on the meat.  Wow.  That wasn't there.  It was a lot of meat in there.  It didn't have a chance to smack down.  Huh?  I need to be set.  I'm ready.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Let's go.  What does he need to do?  For Brian Regan tickets.  Jesus.  Can you get him a pretzel with some mustard too, Brian, in this fucking deal?  Go ahead. 
[02:30:30]  I think I should just give you some comp tickets and let you come check out the show.  Your special guest, motherfucker.  In fact, I'm going to make sure I'm on the record.  You're free to just come to the show.  You don't have to go to this drastic measure.  We'll throw in some mozzarella sticks, though, all right?  Let's make sure this is set up.  Holy shit.  Wait a minute.  We have learned that if that thing flies off the table, it's going to hurt even more.  We learned that with Elo yesterday.  Someone has to anchor that thing. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, someone has to hold it with their hand.  Someone has to anchor the one end of that because I'm telling you.  One of you guys.  One of you young gentlemen has to ball anchor or get a vice or something.  Here's what he's going to have to do.  First of all, let me see a replica mousetrap.  That one over there.  Here, this one's loaded.  I don't want a loaded one.  Okay.  Unloaded.  I want to see.  Okay, it does come right to the edge when it snaps.  Yeah.  Okay.  Ooh.  What we need to do is have him take. 
[02:31:30]  You know what you're going to be doing?  Yeah.  You're going to be taking.  Yeah, it hurts a little later, doesn't it?  Look at this thick black glove.  That's something that somebody would land a hawk on.  You're going to have to take your scrotum, pull it over this edge of the mousetrap.  Okay.  Right.  Right?  But no nut.  Don't put your nut in there.  And then, how will it be triggered so that whatever's triggering it doesn't interfere with the wire hitting the bag? 
[02:32:00]  The scrotum.  He just presses the scrotum.  Is he going to be able to pull enough scrotum up without getting a ball in the way?  This kid is a maniac.  He has a giant ball.  Anthony takes two fingers.  Right.  He stretches out the ball back.  And then he pushes it down.  Pushing it down on the metal piece.  On the mechanism.  Let it fly.  Now, his fingers cannot be in the way.  This has to just be sacked.  Brian, you better be funny, motherfucker.  Brian, realize this video will be downloaded all over the world, by the way. 
[02:32:30]  You better be funny.  Our videos are being downloaded all over the world at this point.  I see everybody watching over there covering their mouths.  He'll be sitting in the front row with his arms crossed.  That's nothing.  That's only a couple hundred people.  This video, I will guess 10,000 people will download it by tomorrow morning.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nobody from work.  A lot of times.  Okay.  So, what, um, we got it straight.  What we're going to do now?  Two fingers.  Two fingers. 
[02:33:00]  Two hands.  Pulling your bag.  Pull your bag.  And kind of pull it out.  And if you could take your middle fingers and push your, your, your, your,  your nuts back, you know what I mean?  Why are you so protective of his nuts?  When did that happen?  Look, I have no love for this guy's nuts.  I have a love for the house I'm getting.  We're trying to be responsible broadcasts.  Right.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  So, you think the scrotum skin is less of a lawsuit than the balls? 
[02:33:30]  If a nut gets hit, it could keep him from having kids.  A scrote getting hit is just that.  But it's all his decision, right?  That's a couple stitches.  Who cares?  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  All right.  So, we know how we're rolling here.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  We can hope.  All right.  Is the camera set?  We're all set.  Camera set.  Make sure no one's in the way.  Danny.  Hold on.  This is Matt from New York City.  And this is for Brian reading tickets.  It's the only way he can get tickets for the show.  Oh, this is.  Caroline, I think if you're going to help.  And I'm offering him a comp. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  He doesn't need to do this.  So, we're not in the way of the camera.  Are you busy Sunday?  Wait, wait.  It's a private show.  Because Brian Regan's going to feel so guilty.  He's going to do an hour for Matt in the office.  This was his own decision to do this.  Sunday tickets still available, nigger.  We can take care of tickets for you.  It's too bad this is the only way you can get tickets to see Brian Regan.  It's a shame, man.  You know, sold out show.  What are you going to do?  Saturday, a 3 p.m. matinee show just for Matt. 
[02:34:30]  What's with your balls?  All right, I don't know.  How do we do this?  We got to.  Well, Danny got to.  Danny's going to hold the trap, but don't get in the way of the camera at all.  Right.  Hold that thing down.  Yeah.  You know what?  Angle the trap more this way.  No, the other way.  The other way.  The other way.  The other way.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Like that.  Now, you stand a little sideways like that. 
[02:35:00]  Perfect.  God, you're a director.  Perfect.  Steven Spielberg over there.  I don't know if I can see this.  Now, well.  You're the thing where you make the rectangle of your hands.  Pull out the sack.  Steven's filming this.  Now, don't do it until we tell you.  Make sure you're.  I have a question.  Just this again?  Yeah.  Push it down.  Yeah, you're going to push that down.  Oh, my God.  No.  Now, pull.  But without putting it in the trap yet, pull it out as far as you can get it.  All right. 
[02:35:30]  Don't put it in the trap yet.  I don't do it.  Don't put it in the trap yet.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Back off.  Back off.  Brian, not one joke better flop, motherfucker.  There's not one.  You better not have laryngitis.  Oh, no, no.  I can't believe this is what this kid has to do for tickets.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, fuck me.  Okay.  And put an apple martini in it, would you?  Put an apple martini in it.  Throw in a Dennis Leary drink, will you?  You're going to be able to pull it and get it so your fingers aren't in the way and snap 
[02:36:00]  it down.  By the way, what show is this for, Brian?  I'm going straight back and writing a whole new act just to make sure it's strong enough  for you.  What show are you going to be at?  I would like to be at the Saturday one.  At what time?  The late one?  10.30?  Is that possible?  We'd have to talk to people up front.  Most likely, this guy's going to be at the Saturday Brian Regan show late night.  Make sure this guy doesn't pay for shit.  He's going to be sitting on stage with Brian Regan books, reading.  Sitting on an ice block.  He's going to be sitting on.  If some of the pests are going to that show, he's going to be at that show. 
[02:36:30]  Search him out and just make sure he doesn't pay for anything.  Good God.  Oh, motherfucking my head.  Are we ready for this?  All right.  We are ready.  Okay.  Well, pull it out again.  Stretch as much as you can stretch.  Make sure it's just bagged.  Do I have to pull it off again?  Once it clips, you do whatever you need to do.  You're brave enough to let it dangle so we get a good shot for the video.  Are we ready? 
[02:37:00]  All right.  Wait, should we do it on three?  No.  I guess let's all be quiet and when he feels it, he'll do it.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Keep your fingers out of the way.  Get a lot of stretch there.  There you go.  I think his fingers are in the way.  Your fingers are in the way.  It's going to be very hard.  You're going to have to stretch a lot.  Stretch it out.  But keep the nuts.  There you go.  Just the edge.  Dude, oh my God.  This is not right.  Here we go.  Wait, is the mousetrap on the edge good enough? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Breathe, breathe.  Holy shit.  What am I doing?  Ready?  Go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, you can't get it all.  You've got to open it, motherfucking one.  Slide it all out.  Words can't describe that for the first time.  For the first time in our careers, words cannot describe that.  Oh, my God.  Dude, that had to hurt.  Did I tell you the second show said it was canceled?  Oh, my God. 
[02:38:30]  Matt.  Shaking.  Comment.  Invigorating.  Let me tell you.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  He might pass out.  Oh, that fucking dad just was not.  Any damage?  A lot of redness.  You all right?  Oh, when you said that, you could feel the power.  When you pull it back.  Oh, my God.  That's like.  Want some water?  No.  It has the force of a medieval catapult, you know. 
[02:39:00]  Knocked out a castle wall.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Look at Brian's like.  Look, dude.  I'm not really sure.  I mean, I could do a Monday show.  It's too bad.  That was the only way you could get the tickets, though, man.  Oh, no, man.  I'm on record five times saying you don't have to do this.  That's okay.  That's okay.  Your own choice, your own decision.  He's on record five times, dude.  Brian didn't say you can go. 
[02:39:30]  Brian had his own paperwork that Matt had him fill out.  That, I never thought anyone would do something like that.  No fucking way.  We've gone right into the garbage.  We've done some sick things on this radio show.  That could be the sickest right there.  That knocked the Tylenol PM right out of that motherfucker.  He's awake.  Thank you.  It doesn't help there.  How does it feel?  I mean, give us something.  It feels numb.  What were you thinking as you were about to do that?  What the fuck was I thinking? 
[02:40:00]  What am I thinking?  He was shaking and everything.  It snapped right down on it.  It was a perfect snap.  It was a perfect execution.  That kills mice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That kills an animal.  I think it kills a future baby that I might have.  That kills an animal that can squish under anything.  It can squish under, it's an animal that has no bone structure or anything else.  Right.  They experiment on this animal, it kills it.  And that motherfucker just snapped it on his nuts, man.  Or the scrotum to be, to be.  Well, let's, the phone's just, just nuts right now. 
[02:40:30]  Anthony Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I was going to comment about the good camera placement when it's a lot lower, but I just  got to say now, best fucking audio ever.  Were you able to see it good?  Oh, excellent.  You know, except for Danny, you know, maybe wanting some nuts on the chin next time.  It was great.  Boy.  I'll crash him for you, Danny.  All right.  Let's go to Matt in Boston.  Matt, what's up?  Yo.  Yo.  You guys are crazy.  I got a knot in my stomach. 
[02:41:00]  My balls just feel like they exploded.  Oh, I can't even imagine how that sounded out there.  Dude, it is just, it's horrible.  My thumbs all on it up.  It's like, I feel this guy's pain.  All right on.  All right, bro.  Let's go to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris.  Hey, I can't imagine what that guy went through, because my, I'm sitting in my car, my back  and legs are soaked in sweat, just listening to that.  He's moving around now.  It's starting to, it gets worse.  Something about the mousetrap, even on the hand, it was worse a little after it. 
[02:41:30]  A little later, right?  It happened, yeah.  I can't even walk it like something here with my hands.  I can imagine what my cock it looks like.  No blood, right?  No, not yet.  No.  Yeah, you'll have a good bruise.  And he slid, he slid it off.  Yeah.  He didn't open it off.  It was so painful.  I was shaking, man.  He was so, he just wanted it off.  Yeah.  He slid and, and the closed mousetrap was pulling his fucking ball sack as he was sliding it  off.  Perfect day to be featured in the Daily News for being a clean, funny, clever show. 
[02:42:00]  By the way, Opie and Anthony's not-so-dirty little secret.  It's a big article, full page in the New York Daily News.  That's like sliding a pit bull off your arm.  Pick it up at the newsstand, people.  The local newsstand.  Instead of opening a pit bull's mouth, you just slide it off.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it hurts.  Slide it off.  Oh, wow.  Let's go to Norm the trucker.  Norm.  Hey, man.  Oh, man.  I'm driving through Atlanta, and I'm about fucking crashed my truck. 
[02:42:30]  That hurt me.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that was rough.  That was so bad.  Painful association.  Yeah, we're going to have to listen to that audio when we get back from break.  Mm-hmm.  I want to hear that again.  We were too detached from the whole thing.  Wow.  Everyone is just calling.  They're like, oh, my God.  They can't believe they just heard that.  Brad the trucker.  Brad, what's up?  Hey, not too much, man.  That was the funniest damn thing I have ever heard.  I had a visualizing of that thing going down on him like a cookie cutter. 
[02:43:00]  He's bouncing his ball sack open.  And if you've ever seen them little clackers back in the 70s,  that you could bounce back and forth on a string with a little ring on you,  that's why I figured he'd jump back and his balls would fall out to start clacking.  Yeah.  That was just the funniest damn thing I heard.  All right.  Thank you.  Matt, you know you're going to be legendary now, right?  Hey.  You are going to be legendary.  That's all it takes to be a legend on this show.  He's in deep shit.  I'd like everybody else to know if you want tickets,  all you've got to do is call Ticketmaster. 
[02:43:30]  212-757-4100.  Yeah, they're not that expensive.  You know, you just buy yourself a ticket.  Hi, Brian.  This is Carol.  I want to go to your show, too.  I have a giant clitoris.  My taint is huge.  I'll take plumber's pliers on my clit to get in the Saturday night 1230.  Vice grips on the tightest setting. 
[02:44:00]  I think we've heard enough from Brian Reagan.  I think he needs to leave the program now.  Brian needs to take his twisted ways and get out of here now.  Brian, thank you so much.  Hey, I'm glad I popped in.  You know, just get a little plug in for the show.  He's a true friend, though, man.  He's not scared of us in this show.  There's always some kind of shit going on when you come in, man.  Oh, my golly.  We've had other people we saw on the show that left us years ago, Brian. 
[02:44:30]  You're still there for us.  You guys have been very supportive.  I appreciate that.  And, you know, that's the whole deal.  Congrats, buddy.  Thank you.  He won't be shaking your hand.  But as I wave from Ammar.  Wave.  Can we get on-air confirmation that this guy is going and what time he's going?  Yeah, where's your guy?  We don't even give him that number to Caroline.  He's going to be like, hey, this is Matt the Mousetrap Ball.  And he's going to be like, no, that second show is sold out. 
[02:45:00]  No, sorry, click.  Like, he doesn't even have time to explain.  Caroline, can I help you?  Hold, please.  Hi, hi, this is Matt the Ball Guy.  Yeah, I'm supposed to go to the Saturday show.  Sold out, click.  Hello, this is Caroline.  Hi, this is Matt the Ball Guy.  Just hold on, please.  Oh, shit.  That's going to learn real fast.  When these mics go off, it's a whole different ball game.  We're on to the next subject.  He's just wandering around the office, you know, trying to figure out who he talks to. 
[02:45:30]  Where's Greg from Caroline's?  He had to run, but Caroline's is going to take care of him.  He's on set for Saturday.  All right.  Nice, bro.  How many people?  That we don't know.  We'll figure it out.  It's probably you plus one.  Is that good enough?  Sure.  Oh, this is a buddy's contract.  Somebody's going to get to go now and didn't have to do shit.  That's right.  You're the one that took the pain.  Right.  Wow.  Can you imagine that?  Any final thoughts?  Still hurting?  Do good, Brian.  My fucking sack is killing me. 
[02:46:00]  You see me with an ice pack, you know why.  You have to be funny enough to get a standing ovation after every joke.  I'm not going to be able to stand, though, so.  You're going to look at this Brian Regan show a little differently.  Just praying.  Oh, it's funny, but it's not, you know, praying I don't get a larynge for this show.  Wow.  Why don't we take it back?  Brian Regan was sick, but in his place we have Sinbad.  Oh, shit.  I took a mousetrap to my balls for Sinbad.  Hey, who's a mousetrap?  You know, Sinbad's a pretty good guy. 
[02:46:30]  I've got no problem.  I would take it to the...  All right.  ...to see Sinbad.  Oh, man.  All right.  Sinbad, who's an idiot who took the mousetrap to the balls?  Brian ain't here.  He wanted me to say, what's up?  All right.  All right, Matt, thank you.  Wet naps.  We'll talk to you after the break.  We've got to say goodbye to Brian Regan, our friend.  Yes, Brian.  All right, guys.  We'll see you at one of the shows.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  We'll all be down there, of course.  It's power lines all weekend long.  Tickets still available for Sunday show, 212-757-4100. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  See you guys.  Thanks.  There he is, Brian Regan, everybody.  Are we going to break?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I'm going to do this first, though.  Patrice.  Two guys getting kicked hard right in the crotch with no protection.  Oh!  That got him.  That got him.  If he wasn't changed up, he would have fallen down.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  This is not right!  Oh! 
[02:47:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  That's it!  That's got him.  Oh!  That's got to be it.  Yeah.  That's got to be it.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's see if we can't get a good kick in from Grandma.  Grandma is lining up.  Oh!  Oh!  He's down!  He's down!  He's down!  He's down!  You don't taunt Grandma like that!  Come on!  She got the bullseye.  Grandma still got a chance, right?  Let's hear it for Grandma. 
[02:48:00]  Grandma, put him down.  Oh!  Let's go right to the phones and say hi to Dave in California.  Dave, what's up?  Hey!  What's up, guys?  What's up, Dave?  I have to understand it's pretty much team over.  There's absolutely nothing that the love geese can do to beat that. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, you're basically saying, uh, top that, Bubba.  Oh, that's nice.  He can top that.  Other than killing sperm receptacle he sits next to live on the air, there's nothing he can do to top that.  That's not even an issue.  Top that, Howard.  Top that, Bubba.  Stop bitching about how you can't do a stupid show and how the government is going to censor you now on satellite  and actually start doing fucking radio.  Exactly, David.  I'm with you today.  I need to say thanks to Anthony.  He mentioned earlier about Brian being in a porno. 
[02:49:00]  That's all I can picture in my head now.  Oh!  I didn't know where you're going with that.  Thank you, Bubba.  All right, bro.  Your phone stinks or we keep you on there.  But, yeah, that's what it comes down to.  Top that.  Start doing radio and stop bitching.  Robert, Dallas, what's up?  How can Brian Regan possibly perform on Saturday having to look at that guy in the front row?  Just knowing what he did to get tickets, yeah.  That's going to be the hottest show to go to, the late night show Saturday. 
[02:49:30]  I love the fact...  That's going to be the most nerve-wracking thing.  I love the fact that Brian is one of the cleanest comics out there.  And whenever he's in studio, we have some of the worst things going on in studio.  Yeah.  He's been here for some, just like, some of the most perverted shit we've ever had in studio.  Well, the best one was not even on our show.  It was on Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez, yeah.  But he was there and, you know, it's just for some reason he's always around when stuff is going on like that. 
[02:50:00]  All right, Robert.  Thanks.  I just decided what show I want to go to.  Late night Saturday.  Yep.  That's the one.  He's going to be a hero.  That's the one to go to.  That's going to be a celebrity.  Hey, Steve, it's just walked into the studio.  The video of Matt taking the mousetrap to the ball sack will be up on opianthony.com later tonight.  That thing is going to be downloaded all over the world.  That one is going to take off.  We'll farm it out to as many people as we can, too.  All right.  And you got a banner, I see.  Yeah, this got sent.  But I got a heads up about this in the email last night. 
[02:50:30]  But someone sent in a banner for tomorrow's American Mess show.  Open call tomorrow.  American Mess starts tomorrow.  It says, American Mess, the banner I'm reading, always messing up family portraits.  One of Norton's lines.  So hopefully people will show up tomorrow.  We have no idea.  It's an open call.  If they show, they show.  If not, we're fucked because we're not planning anything tomorrow.  Rob in Connecticut.  Rob, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Hey, right on.  I actually just drove here from Connecticut. 
[02:51:00]  I'm in New York right now.  Okay.  I came in for maybe like a pre-interview for the Mess because I'm not necessarily like  a retard.  But I do have something for you guys.  Do people understand what we're looking for tomorrow?  It's not necessarily retarded.  It's everything.  If you know the show, you understand what we're looking for.  The next Stalker Patty, the next Pat from Menaki, the next Big A, Twitchels, you know.  It could be anything.  It could be some crazy talent you have that no one else has.  Well, no, I understand that completely. 
[02:51:30]  I just, my boss actually gave me the okay to come down today and it's kind of short notice.  I didn't even have the chance to plan or anything.  I just had to kind of get in my car and go.  All right.  What do you got?  Well, I just wanted to kind of maybe come and hang out and just bullshit with you guys.  Maybe not even on the air, like after the air or whatever.  Wait, you're not even going to be part of the American Mess?  You just want to hang out?  Oh, no.  I'll totally be a part of that if that's what it takes.  But I definitely want to, like, I wanted to meet you guys ahead of time.  I really, like I said, it wasn't a planned thing.  I just had to come down today. 
[02:52:00]  Uh, E-Rock, the video's already up somewhere?  Did you just blow someone off?  They recorded the PalTalk feed and just sent it to us.  So we're going to have it up on the website in a few minutes.  All right.  We're going to have this version of the mousetrap sack bit.  And then later tonight, Steve has a really good video that he'll replace it with, I guess.  So we're going to link this immediately?  Yeah.  Oh, look at Danny just running away, cringing, laughing, doubled over.  Well, you should talk to Danny. 
[02:52:30]  He was at ground zero for that.  What was going through your head, Danny?  Dude, I couldn't look.  Yeah.  I couldn't look.  I wouldn't have looked.  Not directly at him.  You know, I'm thinking in my head, all I'm thinking is, all right, imagine this is happening to you.  Right.  So I'm just, you know, I'm starting to sweat because I could just feel it happening to my own bag.  And I couldn't look at the guy.  I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, it's one of those things where you're really sympathetic to the pain.  Absolutely.  So you can't really look at it.  Mm-hmm.  Don't look directly at it.  Well, we'll link this video.  It's grainy.  And then Steve has the really good crystal clear video that he'll add tonight to opianthony.com. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Let's go to Robert in Washington.  Robert, what's up?  Opie.  Yeah.  Man, I didn't know whether to fucking laugh my ass off or grab my balls and cry.  Holy shit.  Fuck, that was ridiculous.  I never thought I'd ever see somebody do that.  Oh, my God.  A mousetrap.  I was doubled over laughing with both hands over my balls. 
[02:53:30]  Fucking just laughing my ass off.  I know it sucks.  You know it sucks.  Bill Burr started his mousetrap bit yesterday.  It's already over.  Not hearing us take it to the hand is just cute.  Oh, I know.  Stop it.  Yeah.  We're done with the mousetrap thing, I guess.  Yeah, the hand thing yesterday was awesome, but this is, holy shit, this is just out of control.  It's great.  That's why you've got to keep listening to this show.  We always try to top ourselves, and that's why we always get in trouble, by the way.  We always get fired. 
[02:54:00]  Because we should stop there, but now we'll be like, no, let's get rat traps.  Let's get electric traps.  You know, the tip of the dick would be the worst ever.  Right on the head of the dick would be the worst pain that a mousetrap can inflict on a human being.  Why don't you upgrade to balls, Mr. Protect Yourself?  I was protecting the man's testicles.  He was protecting life and liberty in the pursuit of Anthony, and it's like, we've got to move up. 
[02:54:30]  It's got to be balls, and then maybe asshole.  The tip of the dick is problems.  Yeah, the tip of the dick is bad.  That would hurt.  Daniel.  Hey.  Hey, man.  I just wanted to say how funny that was.  That shit was so funny.  I just got my wisdom teeth taken out.  Yeah.  Like, two days ago, and now I'm spitting blood because I was laughing so hard.  Hey, we love that.  People spitting blood from our show.  Right on.  All right, Daniel.  Thank you. 
[02:55:00]  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John, what's up?  Yeah, guys.  Hey.  My brother's a Stern fan, and he has Sirius.  Yeah.  He's on his way now back to Best Buy to take it back and get fucking XM because of Matt's balls  getting crushed by the mousetrap.  He just heard the bit.  He's done.  You guys want him over.  Yeah, it's time to stop bitching and start doing radio, Howard.  Oh, my God.  People are now paying for it.  You've got to give these guys something.  Thank you, John.  Yep, thanks, guys.  All right.  Yeah, we should give him a MiFi or something.  I think he deserves more. 
[02:55:30]  A little more than that.  Yeah, yeah.  Don, you might have to send up a MiFi for good old Matt.  Hey, we have the audio.  E-Rock, don't leave.  I want to play the audio.  E-Rock, where were you going?  Because we were too detached from this.  Oh, he gave me the fuck you look.  Why'd you give Anthony the fuck you look?  Fire him.  I didn't give him the fuck you look.  I was doing something.  I understand.  What were you doing?  Hey, Bill Burr Bitwrecker.  See, my whole thing I've done ever since I've sat in this seat about 14 months ago or so  is to goof on things that I obviously know you're doing but make it seem like you're not doing anything. 
[02:56:00]  See, that's the bit.  Do you get it?  I get it.  Look at his whole man.  You okay?  Yeah, I'm ready.  All right.  Audio's ready to go.  Whew.  Wow.  How do you deal with this shit, guys?  We can always get your job at a mix station.  You want back on like a Z100?  Yeah, a lot less pressure if you work for a mix station. 
[02:56:30]  Or a station that's named after an animal.  That's a lot of those fucking things.  Here it is, once again, the audio of Matt taking a mousetrap to his ball sack.  Let's listen to this.  We are ready, okay?  Well, pull it out again.  Stretch as much as you can stretch.  Make sure it's just bagged.  Do I got to pull it off again?  Like, once it clips, you're going to be hanging around like this.  Once it clips, you do whatever you need to do. 
[02:57:00]  If you're brave enough to let it dangle so we get a good shot for the video, let you know.  Are we ready?  All right.  Wait, should we do it on three?  No.  I guess let's all be quiet, and when he feels it, he'll do it.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Keep your fingers out of the way.  Get a lot of stretch there.  There you go.  I think his fingers are in the way.  Your fingers are in the way.  It's going to be very hard.  You're going to have to stretch a lot.  Stretch it out.  But keep the nuts.  There you go.  Just the edge.  Dude.  Oh, my God. 
[02:57:30]  That's not right.  There we go.  Wait, is the mouse crap on the edge good enough?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Breathe, breathe.  Holy shit.  What am I doing?  Ready?  Go.  Go.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:58:00]  Oh my God!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh my God!  Oh!  Oh, you can't get it all!  You've got to open it, motherfucking!  What?  He's slacking it all out!  Oh!  Words can't describe that for the first time.  Oh!  For the first time in our careers, words cannot describe that.  Oh, my God.  Dude, that had to hurt. 
[02:58:30]  Did I tell you the second show said it was canceled?  Oh, my God.  And there you have it.  Video should be up on Opie and Anthony shortly.  The grainy video that we got off the webcam.  And then video from Pal Talk is up on foundrymusic.com and opieandanthony.com.  It's up and running right now.  There you go.  See, now for the people that don't have Pal Talk, they can go to Foundry and see what they just saw.  Yeah, and later tonight, Steve will have the crystal clear video that will replace it. 
[02:59:00]  Well, he won't replace it, but it will be another look.  We're all about involving the listeners.  See that?  Now, all of a sudden, bam.  You're there.  You go to a website.  You see what just happened.  Or you could have seen it live on the Pal Talk.  Or later on, you'll get the full digital video version of it up online.  Wow.  All right.  How do we top that?  See, that's when we get into trouble.  Don't even think things like how do we top that. 
[02:59:30]  I mean, just for today.  Yeah, I know.  We still have show left.  We do?  Damn it.  Should have saved that for the end.  We're hoping American Mess is going to be a success tomorrow.  We've got a lot of people coming in tomorrow.  How could it fail?  We have a banner now.  It's got to be successful.  I saw Steve bring that in.  I'm like, uh-oh.  We have a banner.  Did you see it?  It looks like it's a blatant ripoff of the American Idol logo.  Yeah.  Look at the thing.  American Mess.  Always messing up family portraits. 
[03:00:00]  Donated by A-plus graphics and signs.  That's good.  Nice copyright infringement with the American Mess logo.  That's all right.  And hopefully we'll get some messes in here.  Hopefully.  Would that have qualified as a mess?  Yeah.  Because that's kind of a stunt, but it's something no one would do.  But that's part of it.  It's very out of the ordinary.  But that's part of the thing we're doing.  I think if he came in tomorrow and showed his swollen bag, that would be a mess.  Yeah.  What's your mess?  My bag is the size of a watermelon. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, it is.  We're looking for everything.  Yeah.  Everything.  Crazy things that you do that you think are unusual that no one else does.  Uh-huh.  You know, the speech impediments, the missing body parts.  A shark bite.  Shark bite would be nice.  Something.  Yeah.  Half your side's missing.  Something like that.  Absolutely.  Mm-hmm.  Lee.  Fuck.  What?  Oh, you said it.  Well, now your nuts got to go in there.  No, that's all right.  No?  You're not going to put your balls in there? 
[03:01:00]  It's going to be anti-colonial.  You load that thing so haphazardly.  Dude, I had a mice problem.  I know these traps.  I went through these, and I got the electric traps.  Forget it.  Game over.  I haven't seen a mouse in months now.  Those are the fun ones.  All right.  Oh.  Oh.  It still hurts very much on the hand, but something has been taken away now that a guy  put his fucking bag in there.  I just knew I couldn't yell, because then, you know, people would be like, oh, shut up. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Oh, man, does that hurt, though.  Yeah.  All right.  A few marks.  Let's go to Utah.  Brody.  What's up, Brody?  Mr. Opie, Mr. Anthony, I just got my My Five for Christmas, brand new Lister, and I came  to work, and I had it on, and I thought the dude was going to win Super Bowl tickets.  So as I'm listening to this, I'm thinking, he's going to win tickets to the Super Bowl  for doing this, and I'm going crazy.  So now I find out the guy's only winning comedy show tickets.  I know, but it's Brian Regan. 
[03:02:00]  We didn't get Super Bowl tickets this year for some reason, because the lawyers know what  we would do.  I tell you what, Brian Regan, you had better be funnier than ever before.  You had better break out all the best stuff, and the best part of that was Patrice.  Yeah.  Patrice and the high school of his, that was my favorite part of the whole thing.  Yeah, you yelled louder than Matt.  I'm not into that pain shit, dude. 
[03:02:30]  No.  Right.  No.  No.  All right, Brody, you're a new listener?  New listener.  Big time.  New listener.  See, now this is your job.  We like to call it the ONA virus.  Yeah.  It's like a virus, and we like it to spread slowly but surely.  So now, if you enjoyed that, you tell a few friends, hey, this is what Opie and Anthony  did today on XM Sili Radio.  Right.  All right, you don't have the XM.  Well, at least go to their website, opieandanthony.com, and see the video for yourself.  And then that's the job of the listener.  That's your part of the ONA virus.  That's how the virus spreads. 
[03:03:00]  That's all you have to do.  You hear something crazy on this show, tell a friend.  Tell them where they can see the video.  It reminds me of being back in college when I got that one virus, but that's a whole different  thing.  But, yes, I will spread the virus.  All right.  Thank you, Brody.  Thank you.  All right.  We got some stuff for Matt.  E-Rock, what do we got?  We have a Sky-Fi 2 and the Sky-Fi Boombox 4.  Ah, that's nice.  Well, bring them back in here.  Matt.  That's good.  Got one of those at home. 
[03:03:30]  Actually, these are great.  Right in the bedroom.  Matt, we're going to give you some XM stuff.  Oh, thanks a lot.  On top of the Brian Regan tickets for Saturday's Late Show.  That's great.  So, you got the Delphi, Sky-Fi, whatever it's called.  Yep.  Actually, that's the one I got in my car.  I love that one.  And then you got the Boombox so you can listen at home.  Beautiful.  So, what you do is you take that out of your car, slide into there, and you got XM at home  as well.  Right?  Yep.  That's great.  And we're going to hook it up to it.  Yeah, Don's going to activate it.  Wow.  And they're going to activate it.  So, you don't even have to pay for it.  You don't even have to pay for it.  So, now you can... 
[03:04:00]  Look at what your nuts have done for you today.  I can't even more.  So, let me tell you what you do.  So, now you cancel the other one that you're paying for.  Now, you got XM for free.  Hey.  Hey.  Or you pass it on to a friend if you're really...  Or you can flush it down the toilet, get serious, and go fuck your mother.  Fuck Howard.  Jimmy Norton so eloquently put it.  I don't think anyone's ever going to top you on the radio without a major lawsuit.  Let's just put it that way.  So, there it is.  You guys are the best.  I'll do anything for you guys.  All right.  It's Matt, everyone.  Very good.  Thanks, Matt.  Thank you.  Why don't we take another break, regroup, and we'll finish the Opie and Anthony show in a few minutes here. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, I'm so tired of waiting, waiting for us to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.  Yeah, I'm so sick of waiting for us to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, and we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, it's time to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, and we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. 
[03:05:00]  Ah, Rob is calling back from Connecticut.  Rob.  Yo, what's up?  What's up, Rob?  How you doing?  I'm across the street from you guys.  I at least want to give you guys a gift that I brought for you.  Well, that sounds ominous.  I know.  No shit.  What'd you bring?  You're a little gift.  No, no, no.  You're dead, fucker.  No, it's nothing bad.  It's actually just liquor.  Liquor?  Yeah, like...  No one really drinks anymore in here.  Oh, come on.  Not on weekdays. 
[03:05:30]  I'm going to call Bravo Sierra.  Yeah.  There's something going on with Rob.  Fishy.  No, look out the window.  I'm outside the window on a phone.  Wait, look out the window.  Oh, that's great.  Let Iraq look, so if it's a red laser dot between his eyes, we know...  No, I'm the only person on this part of the street with the phone.  Where, across the street?  Yeah.  Get the bullhorn.  Let's yell down to him.  Throw something at him.  Do a hostage negotiation.  Yeah, get the wireless mic and the bullhorn. 
[03:06:00]  For me?  Yeah.  Oh, okay, cool.  Where is he?  Are you guys, what, second level up?  I kind of see him.  The blinds make it easier.  Yeah, if you don't have extra vision, you're going to have to open the blind.  Hold on, we're getting you on the webcam for the PalTalk people.  I moved it too fast.  Well, there's obviously a bunch of people that found me, because I see a bunch of people  just gawking at this point.  What, you see people gawking from the window?  Yeah, but you guys are on the fifth floor, I think. 
[03:06:30]  I think they're on the, I can't tell what floor they're on from out here.  Eh, fourth, fifth, sixth, somewhere around there.  Well, I'm not going to throw rocks and find out.  I really figured you guys would be in a bigger building, too.  I was on 56th Street, and I'm like, wow, this building is awesome, these guys are, and then  I came over to the Economist building, and I was slightly disappointed, I'll be honest.  Dude, it's a radio show, you just need a room.  Oh, no, I know, it doesn't matter what the building looks like.  I was just, I was starstruck by the first building I thought it was, and then realized 
[03:07:00]  that it's over here.  Yeah, this is our New York offices, I guess.  That's awesome, dude.  You don't know where he is now, Ant?  Yeah, there, I see him.  He's in front of the Directors Guild of America.  Right.  Standing right there with an angry guy.  Do we have eggs that we can throw at him?  Oh, oh, that's great.  What kind of liquor do you have?  James and whiskey.  Oh, a little whiskey action.  They got these stupid blinds in this.  A little Irish coffee in the morning never killed anybody.  He's pacing back and forth, you look like a fucking lunatic. 
[03:07:30]  Well, I know, my hands are a little cold, I've been out here for quite a while.  And what are you doing out there?  You just want to, like, drop in?  Hang on, there's a big truck.  Hang on, there's a big truck.  I wish it would hit you.  Why don't we negotiate this like it's a hostage situation?  All right.  Is that your bicycle?  Uh, no.  No?  All right.  Tip it over.  Just tip it over?  Just tip it over.  I think it's what's changed.  Tip it over.  Just fuck it. 
[03:08:00]  He just tipped it over.  Did he really?  Yeah, he just pushed it over the bicycle.  He's kicking it.  All right.  Leave the Jameson near a mailbox and we'll go get it.  Yeah.  We...  Leave it where?  We don't trust you.  We really don't trust you.  We don't trust you at all.  You really shouldn't.  That's fine.  I understand that.  Like, just go in the building then?  Well, go in the building or leave it on the sidewalk.  Uh, Poe...  Wait, Poe's going down to make the exchange.  Oh, Poe's going down.  Yeah. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  What do you want?  A t-shirt?  Bumper sticker?  What do you want?  Uh, whatever.  I just...  I mean, I just wanted the bullshit.  I wanted to definitely do something with the American mess, but I don't, like, have a speech impediment  and I have all my fingers, so, I mean, I'm just kind of funny and I don't know how to explain that to you.  My phone's about to die, too.  It's why I'm trying not to sound like a rambling idiot, but I'm trying to get what I can out before I get cut off.  Uh, Keith on Long Island.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Poe?  Hey, I just wanted to let you know I was going to come down there tomorrow.  I was, uh, I was down in your studios when you guys were on NEW. 
[03:09:00]  I sweat on half my face.  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  You're still alive?  Yeah, I'm still alive.  This guy has a...  I was still alive a couple months back.  This guy has a weird thing that happens to him.  Yeah, really strange.  He only sweats on half his face.  And according to the doctors we had in that day, that's not good.  That means there's things going on inside his body.  He eats, uh, he eats, what, hot food, spicy food?  Yep, and then anything physical, working out, running, it's the other side of the face. 
[03:09:30]  Right.  And then he'll just sweat on half the face right down the middle.  Exactly.  All right, we'll see you tomorrow, Keith.  You got it, buddy.  All right, thank you.  You got it.  Is Poe out there getting the Jameson?  No?  Yes?  Maybe so?  Yeah, probably.  Um, the, uh, people are yelling, open the blinds, open the blinds.  They don't open.  They don't open.  I'm so sorry.  We can't get to those blinds for some reason.  No, we're too, um, there's like, we're too immature to work blinds. 
[03:10:00]  Well, there's two windows.  I don't even know how you get to those blinds.  It's double-paned.  How do you, you got, you got to take off this big, uh, second glass thing.  And then get in there?  They talk about what a pain in the ass it is to get in there.  Oh, all right.  So that ain't happening.  All right.  I'm distracted because, uh, people are checking out the video of the guy getting the mousetrap  on the sack.  It's getting, uh, viewed like crazy already.  And then Steve's going to have the, uh, the crystal clear video later tonight.  It's on opanthony.com, the webcam version right now. 
[03:10:30]  So, there you have it.  Um, Anthony, someone sent this in.  This will bring back a memory.  All right.  Light up the lucky, it's light of time.  Be happy, go lucky, it's light of time.  For the taste that you like, light up the lucky strike.  Relax.  It's light of time. 
[03:11:00]  Good old days.  A.L.S., M.F.T., lucky strike means fine tobacco.  Light up a lucky.  Prove to yourself how much more real, deep-down smoking enjoyment  they give you.  Remember, in all the world, there's no finer cigarette than lucky strike.  Wow.  Isn't that great?  The good old days.  Whether you're working on a tractor,  or welding the latest size skyscraper,  or holding down Negroes, 
[03:11:30]  it's lucky strike cigarettes.  It's a very white commercial.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Smoke a lucky.  Ugh.  When you're gouging the eyes out of a chap,  that's right,  or blowing the brains out of the Nazi huns,  light up a lucky,  it shows you're a true American.  We love lucky strike cigarettes,  and when our boys come home,  and move into suburbia,  you know they'll be walking down the street's best gal on their arm, 
[03:12:00]  smoking a lucky,  without a Negro in sight in the neighborhood.  Lest the fire hose and German shepherds come out,  but you can watch from a safe distance,  safe, you, your wife, your children,  and your lucky strike cigarettes.  It's the whitest commercial there.  They all sound like that's what the guy should be saying. 
[03:12:30]  Every one of those old-time commercials.  He's talking in code there.  You never hear it.  Yo, enjoy a lucky man.  It's just,  ah, yes,  it's what the country was built upon.  Our ideals.  Here's a Newport commercial.  Hey!  It's a little jazzy.  It is menthol.  Newport tastes fresher. 
[03:13:00]  Tastes better to...  Newport tastes fresher.  That one's boring, though.  That one, as you can tell,  it's a little jazzy.  Like, you know,  Newport, menthol.  You know,  they want it to be in the urban neighborhood.  Yeah.  I've got to interrupt for a second.  Danny, you're downstairs?  Yes, I am.  Oh, shit.  All right, what's up?  I don't know.  Poe's just having a conversation with the guy.  I don't know exactly what he's talking about yet,  so I'm going to figure this out. 
[03:13:30]  Excuse me, sir?  Yes.  What's your name?  Rob.  Rob.  And, oh,  he has some delicious Jameson for us.  What else you got?  Well, I mean,  I have other stuff.  Well, what is it?  A little gonge.  Oh, and he's got a little gonge as well.  A little gonge.  Well, Dan,  you better confiscate that.  I don't want any of the children finding that.  So, all right. 
[03:14:00]  All right,  that's now been trashed.  So,  are we negotiating to see if he's coming up?  No, he's not coming up.  Oh, okay.  Should I break it to him on any of them?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's not coming up.  We don't want him.  The guys don't want you to come upstairs.  That's fine.  I don't know.  That's why it's the point I've been called back to this.  I don't want to come down for nothing.  I wanted to at least give you guys a bottle.  If I can come back tomorrow for the American Messing,  that's great.  I'll do that.  Can he come back tomorrow?  Yeah,  he can stay down on the sidewalk tomorrow.  All right,  you can come back on the sidewalk tomorrow. 
[03:14:30]  Well, thanks.  Thanks,  that's great.  I'll bring gloves this time,  I guess,  apparently.  All right.  He didn't say what was,  what he's,  does he have an affliction or something?  No,  he just wants to hang out.  He just wants to hang out?  Excuse me,  sir,  why do you want to come down for the American Mess?  What's wrong with you?  Well,  no,  that's the point.  There's nothing really wrong with me.  I just have a great sense of humor,  and I think I can bring that.  It's not necessarily part of the show,  but I think you guys could do something with me.  Oh,  boy.  Well,  have him give us an example of his sense of humor.  All right,  we want an example of your sense of humor. 
[03:15:00]  And go.  Well,  it really,  it's a matter of,  it's not necessarily like,  here's a joke,  like,  thanks,  by the way,  here's the on the spot moment.  I'm more of like a situational humor,  like,  what's going on?  I'm good at like,  commenting on it.  I'm quick-witted with that.  But it's not like,  hey,  two men walking down the street.  I can't,  I can't think of a joke like that.  All right,  what were we talking about today then?  All right,  riff on something.  We need him to riff on something,  something that's in the news.  All right,  riff on something in the news. 
[03:15:30]  If we think it's good,  we'll let him up tomorrow.  Well,  the whole fact that,  you know what,  the seven kids thing,  that is,  I only heard a little bit about that this morning,  and I heard it on IMAS,  because I'm getting dressed,  and I get into the car,  and I really wasn't sure  if you guys were going to fuck with that yet or not,  because I don't know if it's too soon or not,  but like,  even the minors thing in general,  I think that the whole 12 minors thing,  how like,  people are able to die,  and it's let out on the news  that everybody's fine,  everything's okay.  I had to be the bearer of bad news  to my coworker the next day.  He's like,  oh,  you know,  all the people from the mine, 
[03:16:00]  they're all alive,  everything's great,  and everything like that.  I'm like,  oh,  sorry,  dude,  but I don't mean to be the bearer of bad news,  but they actually all died,  except for one.  Guys,  I got to tell you,  it's hilarious down here.  Okay,  terrific.  Wow.  Wasn't that great?  That is pretty brilliant.  That's all he has to say  on the minors disaster?  That's it.  It's that kind of stuff we'd get  if he was sitting here,  and we were just talking about it,  and he was riffing.  To tell you the truth,  when I took the phone back, 
[03:16:30]  I was kind of surprised  you were still there.  Oh,  really?  Yeah,  I figured you guys had long arms.  Had hung up?  No.  Oh,  yeah.  Well,  he didn't add anything with that.  He was going nowhere.  All right.  One more?  Yeah,  give us one more.  All right.  Thanks.  All right,  how about something else?  Just got to,  situation.  We're giving him a chance.  Something's got to happen,  and then I can make fun of  whatever's happening.  Well,  I'm standing on the fucking street corner  freezing my balls off,  my un,  oh,  that mousetrap thing. 
[03:17:00]  Oh,  it's just,  you know what,  actually,  the fact that you guys have  the greatest hold music  of all time,  because I was actually able  to listen to the show  while I was on hold.  That was awesome,  although the unfortunate thing  was that I never knew  when someone was talking to me.  Every five seconds,  I got to say hello  like a walking...  All right.  Shit.  Man,  that was fucking...  Wow.  Like,  that was just...  Really bad,  right?  ...wrenchingly,  and it's not even bad,  like,  because he was bad,  it was just  the situation, 
[03:17:30]  and it's just this poor retard  who just came to give you guys  some fucking wine.  He's trying whiskey,  I think.  And he's looking for a place  to riff.  It's like,  you don't just go...  Yeah.  Riff and riff.  Yeah,  he should have just said,  you don't just riff  like on mic like that.  The riff would have been,  are you...  What am I going to riff about?  That's good.  Let me talk about  the gum on the sidewalk.  What are you assholes  up there stupid?  I can't riff on nothing.  Yeah.  But,  the minors. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah,  the minors.  Oh,  the mousetrap guy?  The mousetrap.  You know,  if I was up there,  boy,  woof.  As soon as you say,  you tell her,  hey,  riff.  Fellas,  come on.  I mean,  we're all entertainers,  you know?  Yeah.  Don't you understand?  Has anyone ever asked you  just to start riffing,  motherfucker?  Out of nowhere?  You know what?  I'm insulted.  Give me my fucking liquor back.  Y'all would have been like,  send this guy upstairs.  Let's go to Gooch in Cleveland.  Gooch,  save the show,  will ya?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  That guy was awful. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Hey,  I want to be an American mess.  Oh.  Tomorrow?  Yes.  You're going to come down  from Cleveland?  Absolutely.  All right,  what do you got?  My nuts smell like a sewer.  Wait.  All right,  look.  It's not a lifetime.  They do.  I'm not even kidding you.  I'm not even kidding you.  You stand in a sewer,  I put my balls on your nose,  you can't tell the difference.  Yeah,  but a shower,  like,  will help that.  I know.  A shower will just cure that.  A wash.  Guy's trying to make a joke.  Just try to make a little funny, 
[03:19:00]  I was ripping on my balls right there.  There.  All right,  we got you.  Now that's funny.  All right.  Okay,  bye-bye.  Bye,  Gooch.  Well,  tomorrow is going to be a great show,  I think.  I think we're going to get some people down here  for American mess.  We'll get some people.  It's the first open call.  We're going to do it every Friday.  Well,  we'll see how it goes tomorrow.  We do have two trips to the lingerie bowl  to give away.  Yes.  The two best ones,  I guess,  tomorrow.  And where is that being held?  L.A.  L.A.  Yeah,  so you get a trip to L.A.  You get to see the lingerie bowl. 
[03:19:30]  Hey,  good question for Patrice O'Neal.  Jim,  Wisconsin,  what's up?  Yeah,  I wanted to ask Patrice  what the possibility is  if the mousetrap ball sack thing  is going to make it on WebJunk 20.  0.00%.  Imagine you describe it like you weren't there,  like,  hey,  this is this radio show.  That would be crazy to be there.  These guys,  I don't know,  whatever these holes are,  motherfuckers.  I'd like to kick their ass for this. 
[03:20:00]  Just off camera,  there you are.  I had to pretend I didn't.  You see your elbow?  L.A.  trip is courtesy of  bowdog.net,  by the way.  Hey,  you know,  we're stumbling to the finish line today.  Do you have the Bush sounding drunk?  Speaking of WebJunk 20,  you have it on disc.  We blew our load too early,  is what it was.  Yeah,  that should have been the grand finale.  That should have been the grand finale.  Yeah,  but how would you know?  How would you know?  It could have been a bus.  That's all hindsight. 
[03:20:30]  It could have flopped.  You know,  you could have did it,  all right,  oh shit,  here's the mouth trap on the nuts.  Yeah.  Then I'd be like,  all right,  and Brian would have been like,  I gotta go.  Well,  people will enjoy this.  I'm supposed to leave.  People will enjoy this.  Patrice O'Neill in studio,  he's starting a run at Helium Comedy Club in Philly,  starting tonight,  and you're going to be back on the show tomorrow,  which is crazy,  helping us out.  Check him out on WebJunk 20,  VH1.  This is my favorite clip so far,  the Bush clip.  Listen to this.  It's quick.  Did you hear these rumors  that President Bush is drinking again? 
[03:21:00]  Have you heard this?  I mean,  it's frightening.  I'm not sure it's true.  It's probably not,  but I'm telling you.  Well,  look,  take a look at this.  Take a look.  I would have stood up here a year ago  in one of my many press conferences  and told you  that in the next year I make this prediction to you  that over 10 million Iraqis, 
[03:21:30]  including many Sunnis,  will vote for a permanent government.  I think you probably  will have said  Barry Lewis again.  That is beyond funny.  Who knew, man?  You just slow it down a little bit  and he sounded completely drunk.  Oh,  that's the bottle of Jameson, eh?  Yep.  You want it?  No.  Trust it. 
[03:22:00]  Could be urine in there.  No,  it's sealed,  isn't it?  Doesn't matter.  Could be very clever.  You're paranoid.  To be clever.  I watched Columbo.  They injected through the top or something.  Yeah,  that's what happened in that movie,  Leviathan.  You ever seen that movie?  Yeah.  They was drinking the vodka.  That's right.  All of a sudden,  they're fish monsters.  Fuck that.  I always thought closed shit  never impressed me  like something being closed  is because,  you know,  you think of paranoid shit to do.  It's like a fucking needle, man.  A needle  and a nice injection  on top of something.  Through a cork. 
[03:22:30]  Through a cork.  Or something.  Yeah.  Or anything.  All right,  let's play  What Did We Learn  on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's Eric in O-Town.  Bring it on, brother.  O-Town.  Wow.  Tough guy.  Eric,  what's up?  Love you guys all the time.  Today I learned  that Bubba the Love Spunk  had to suck  Howard Stern's  Tic-Tac-Soccox  to work for the  second place  sorry company.  Yeah,  where's your pride, man?  Where's your pride?  Good job.  All right,  let's go to Ray in Virginia.  Ray?  Hey,  I learned that a yam bag  with a mousetrap 
[03:23:00]  equals Brian Regan ticket.  Absolute.  Hey.  Absolute.  And O.J.?  Hey.  You got to do it again.  Oh,  see?  See?  You said that  so recklessly.  No,  you're...  Oh my God,  I can't watch.  You set this mousetrap.  Oh!  Oh,  I got you.  See,  I got you.  You said it  like a lunatic.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike,  what did you learn  on the show today?  I learned today 
[03:23:30]  I had to get rid of my  mousetraps  and get gluetraps  because the mousetraps  fucking hurt.  Oh,  you got rid of the mousetraps  and you're going to  gluetraps now?  Oh,  fuck yeah,  man.  I can't even look at  the things anymore.  All right.  Thank you.  Rob on Long Island.  Rob?  Hey,  what's up,  guys?  Yeah,  first I just wanted  to ask Patrice,  once like Jimmy's back,  you know,  for good,  would you be able to like  come once we can do  like an advice segment,  you know,  got problems with your hoe?  Ask Patrice O'Neal,  you know,  like something like that.  Patrice?  You give the best advice  on the show  like when you're on there. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah,  Patrice isn't going anywhere.  He's impressed so many people,  everyone that works  on this show,  everyone in Washington.  We're going to figure out  a role that makes sense  for him.  Okay.  I'll tell you what I learned.  Well,  actually I won't  because I'll just be riffing,  you know,  so.  All right.  Don't riff.  Thank you.  Let's go to Tommy Boy.  Riff for us.  Tommy Boy.  Yeah,  what's going on?  Hey,  what did I learn?  I just want to tell you  that an obsessed fan  trying to riff  is more cringe  than a guy catching  a mousetrap  on a scrotum.  All right.  That's a good one.  Thanks,  Tommy Boy.  You got it. 
[03:24:30]  We're out of here.  Patrice O'Neal,  Helium Comedy Club  starting tonight in Philly  all weekend long  and we'll see you tomorrow,  Patrice.  Patrice O'Neal,  you're coming to the show.  We'll be in the Anthony Show. </pre>
