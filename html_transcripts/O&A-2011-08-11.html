<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts playfully repeating the show's title before launching into a discussion about their mundane daily routines, comparing it to *Groundhog Day*. Opie recounted spilling nail polish, leading to a conversation about toilet paper usage, Sheryl Crow's one-square policy, and graphic details of their bowel habits and hygiene routines, including a bizarre Jim Norton anecdote about a massage therapist.  They reminisced about cloth diapers and landfills, sharing humorous anecdotes about their fathers.  The conversation then veered to the cancellation of George Lopez's show, Conan O'Brien's low ratings, and the confusing channel numbers for their own show on SiriusXM.  They mentioned upcoming appearances by the cast of *Jersey Shore*, including Snooki, whose behavior was discussed throughout the show, interspersing off-color jokes and anecdotes with a call from "Army Bob," marked by cryptic conversations.  Musical interludes featuring Patrice O'Neal and Warren Hayes were played.

The show continued with a tangent about Peruvian women collecting cans in derby hats, transitioning to critiques of Snooki's fashion choices and the hosts’ past encounters (or lack thereof) with her. A video of someone masturbating while driving was discussed, followed by a sarcastic comment from a caller, Tony from Ohio, about Iraq. More graphic descriptions of Snooki's appearance followed, along with a comparison to Jane Fonda and a discussion about which woman they'd prefer to have sex with, including a photo of Jane Fonda shown and discussed by Jimmy Norton.  Further listener calls, including more from "Army Bob," and discussions about encounters with celebrities like Jane Fonda, Joel McHale, and UFC fighters filled the airwaves.  A caller described their addiction to eating dirt clods ("e-box"). Sterling provided enthusiastic, over-the-top baseball commentary with multiple replays. The show concluded this segment with discussions of Jimmy Norton's home repairs and firearm ownership, along with their opinions on sports commentators and news outlets.

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of a military helicopter crash and strategic decisions, swiftly shifting to a humorous analysis of a photograph of Tiger Woods, speculating about the contents of his pants. A news story about a man arrested for popping pimples in public led to graphic descriptions of zit-popping and genital warts.  A listener requested Adam Sandler's "Zitli Van Zittles," which was played and criticized.  The conversation returned to Tiger Woods, focusing on his personal scandals, addiction, sexual behavior, and the impact on his golf game.  The hosts, along with a studio guest (Travis), and callers then discussed the PGA tournament and offered their picks for the winner, with a running gag involving an unnamed recurring guest.  Davis Love III was discussed, including a listener anecdote about a plane crash involving his father and a belief that Love III communicates with his deceased father through rainbows.  The hosts attempted to find a video of Davis Love III confronting a heckler, hampered by misspellings and a caller’s false claim that Davis Love III was related to Courtney Love (later verified as false).  The segment ended with a call from "Nikki," who shared personal details, leading to a sexually charged exchange.  Nikki also revealed details about her divorce and past career as an EMT, discussing death and gruesome on-the-job experiences.

The show then featured a lengthy interrogation of Nikki, who called in to discuss her gastric sleeve surgery.  The hosts challenged her story with online information, revealing inconsistencies about her weight, occupation, family, and other personal details. Several other callers joined, adding to the chaotic and increasingly sexually charged conversation.  A caller named G appeared on Paltalk, allowing viewers to see her.  The conversation then shifted to unrelated topics: a former governor’s death, Apple’s success, and a George Lopez joke. Roadhog, a remote caller, fired a gun in his backyard.  Fez’s earlier meltdown was mentioned. The show ended abruptly without a formal sign-off.

The “After Opie and Anthony Live” segment began with Kenny providing updates on Snooki's arrival and paparazzi, making inappropriate comments.  They discussed the earlier caller "Nikki" and her lies. A song by "Club Soda Kenny," a sexually explicit parody of Owl City's "Fireflies," was played. The main focus shifted to the arrival of the cast of *Russian Dolls* (Diana, Renata, Anastasia, and Boris), who discussed their show, which focused on the Russian community in Brighton Beach.  The hosts engaged in banter with the cast, including jokes about Russian culture, accents, and appearances.  There was flirtatious banter, particularly between the hosts and Anastasia and Deanna.  Joey Fatone from NSYNC then joined, promoting *Karaoke Battle USA*, discussing NSYNC's legacy, other boy bands, and his post-NSYNC career. The segment concluded with goodbyes and show promotions.

We gave our opinions and talked about  everything we needed to yesterday.  And what really happened overnight?  Nothing different.  We could just really go in with gusto and verve.  It's Groundhog Day. 
[00:05:30]  You're absolutely right, Silly Goose.  It's Groundhog Day for us.  That's what it is.  Every morning, I hear Ant kick the door  before he enters the studio.  The band has me.  Every morning, Kenny stands over me.  Would you like to eat now  or after first break, GH?  Yeah.  Everything is the same.  Everything.  Kenny puts my bag up on the chair  so I can get all the stuff out  and ask me what I want.  But he does it exactly the same  every single day. 
[00:06:00]  It's the same thing.  Every morning when we're driving in,  he calls Jim Norton at 5.30.  Jim? Jim Norton?  He panics if it's 5.29 or 5.31.  Yeah.  He goes, hi, Jim. It's 5.30.  Would you like me to call you back  in 10 minutes?  It's Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny.  I sure as heck fire remember you.  Yeah, Kevin from Connecticut.  Greg? Greg Hughes?  It was Ned Ryerson, right? 
[00:06:30]  Ned Ryerson.  And Phil Connors?  Yeah, Ned Ryerson lives by you, doesn't he?  Oh, that's years ago.  Did he move?  I used to see Ned Ryerson.  I don't know his real fucking name.  I think he was in town doing a movie  so he was renting a place very close to me  so I did see him all the time.  Yeah.  And I did call him Ned Ryerson once  and he fucking wasn't happy about it.  Ah, please.  I was feeling it so I went,  Ned?  Ned Ryerson?  And he blew me off.  Of course.  He doesn't want to hear that.  I'm like, who else is recognizing you  as Ned Ryerson? 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  I like Groundhog Day.  I think that's a great fucking movie.  It is one of those you could just keep watching  like Groundhog Day.  It's kind of ironic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was, oh God, I woke up.  And you know, I have very ritualistic days,  mornings during the week.  You know, you wake up at a certain time.  I leave myself no extra time for any shenanigans.  Like if there's traffic on the expressway,  I'm on the phone to Kenny going,  I'm going to be five minutes late. 
[00:07:30]  I'm going to be ten minutes later.  Not late, but later than usual.  Right.  And this morning,  I reach up into the cabinet  and fucking pink nail polish.  Mine.  It's my pink nail polish.  Why would you allow us to say that?  Yeah, well, I know.  Give us a break, man.  I was headed off at the pass, don't I?  I see it in slow motion,  tumbling to the floor.  And all I remember is the old days,  how nail polish bottles 
[00:08:00]  were pretty much indestructible.  Oh, yeah, man.  They would bounce.  Yeah, yeah.  They would just bounce around.  I rarely saw them break.  This fucking went off like napalm  all over the kitchen granite floor.  Pink nail polish.  And now all I'm thinking is  this throws off everything  as far as time goes.  And then I'm thinking  of those bounty paper towel commercials  where they show the kid 
[00:08:30]  pull off a big load of towels  and then the mother goes,  ah, ah, ah,  and just one little swath.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  I pulled the whole roll  off the fucking dispenser  and I'm just going,  fuh, fuh, fuh.  Throwing it on the floor  just trying to get up  as much of that  and the glass  and everything as possible.  And now time is of the essence  because this shit dries.  Like, really,  it's fast drying nail polish.  Yeah.  So I wipe up as much as I can. 
[00:09:00]  Now right in front of the refrigerator  on my nice granite floor,  it's just smeared pink.  Ugh.  Which I gather  nail polish remover  will, you know,  take off.  Some kind of alcohol-based thing.  But I had no time for that.  And I'm looking at my phone  and looking at the time  and it's like,  you know,  ah, great,  I'm eight minutes off schedule.  Right.  So I got to make that up  on the road,  which is even more dangerous  than usual.  Mm-hmm.  I wound up being about,  I guess,  five minutes later than usual. 
[00:09:30]  But I left probably 20,  not 20,  about 10 minutes later  than I normally do.  So I made five minutes  up on the road.  But it was one of those things  where it's like,  I don't need this  to start my day.  Like,  that's the first thing  that happened  during my fucking day.  All it takes  is one of those things  to throw you off  for the entire morning.  Yeah,  I was just like,  fuck.  Look at us  making up stuff right now.  I like this.  That's what happened.  I didn't even know  we were going to talk about this.  That's what happened.  That's one thing that happened.  I got a load of things  that I just got to remember.  And then when you went, 
[00:10:00]  you know what popped in my mind?  Stupid Sheryl Crow saying  we need just one square  of toilet paper  to wipe our asses.  Oh, really?  You're going to fucking  smell her fingers?  You know what that must smell like?  Not all of us  eat like hippies.  Yeah.  Don't have rabbit shits.  Right.  Where you could just dab your ass  with one square of paper.  I challenge all our listeners today  to do the Sheryl Crow approach.  I know this is a few years ago.  If you could find the story,  Sam,  that would be terrific.  But she really wanted  all of us  to use one square 
[00:10:30]  of toilet paper  to, of course,  save the environment  or whatever the fuck.  I have to slam my fist  into a sock.  That's how I wipe my ass.  Fuck Sheryl Crow  and the lousy music.  I think it's,  I think I easily do  a half a roll  of toilet paper  some mornings.  Every day.  It's like,  why is this going away?  Right.  Sometimes it's like  black tar heroin.  Yeah.  It's like,  what is this?  It won't stop.  It's sticky.  I don't know  what the fuck is going on.  I think it's Guinness.  It's like wipe, wipe.  You just keep wiping 
[00:11:00]  until there's nothing  on the paper, right?  Yeah, yeah.  That's usually the game.  Like you're saying,  because I guess it's greasy  and has the consistency  of heroin,  like you said.  Or, what'd you say?  Yeah, black tar heroin.  Black tar heroin  that it just will not wipe up.  Or that,  or a fucking,  one of those  Dairy Queen Frosties.  Yeah.  It just keeps coming out.  I don't get it.  The worst is when  you break the piece off  and you know  you're going to be  fucking wiping for eons.  And eons.  You're just going to be there  forever sitting there. 
[00:11:30]  What you're going to have to do  is you're going to have to give up  and realize  the paper is just like  light tan now.  It ain't going to get  any better than this  because there's  seven inches of log left.  Oh, yeah.  There's no way  I'm getting through all this  unless I'm ready  to come in an afternoon to it.  Unless I want to be  late for work.  Have you ever forfeited  and just jumped in the shower?  Oh, yeah.  Many times.  There are times  you just got to go,  I need soap,  a washcloth,  and...  I fucking...  One time I was...  I took a shit 
[00:12:00]  and then I...  I always hate  when I did shit  before massages  because, you know,  like you want them  probing your ass a little bit.  Oh, no.  But I took a dump  and I cleaned my asshole  out really good  and the massage therapist  was one who would  lick my ass  once in a while.  Jesus.  That's some massage.  Yeah, yeah.  This is fucking years ago.  I just...  Believe me,  I wish I still  knew where she was.  I love her soul.  And she was rubbing  my ass cheeks  and she was...  She was kissing  by my thing  and she goes...  She slapped my ass  and she goes,  if you hop in the shower,  I'll lick it.  I had just showered 
[00:12:30]  before she got there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jimmy,  you didn't clean up  good enough?  I think I cleaned good enough  but I think what happened was  I think I fucking...  I did...  I snapped off the log  in my eagerness to shower  and there's no way  to get rid of that.  It's like a bad thought.  It just keeps leaking out.  That's like...  It's right at the door  is why.  Oh, yeah, it's festering.  That's like stopping  the traffic  in the Lincoln Tunnel. 
[00:13:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  No one else  could go through the tube  but you know  it's all just waiting.  Oh, it's backed up in there.  It's just waiting  for the okay sign.  Yeah, and then it's  just coming out.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, the second  the cop at the beginning  in front of the tunnel  that stopped everyone  walks out of the way.  Yeah.  Oh, people are moving.  Yeah, you're so right.  So, stupid Cheryl Crowe.  What is it?  Cheryl suggested  using one square  of toilet paper  and proposed clothing  with detachable  dining sleeves  to use instead  of paper napkins.  What? 
[00:13:30]  Wait, but...  I don't know.  Dining sleeves?  Proposed clothing  with detachable  dining sleeves.  So you could wipe  your mouth  with your sleeve?  What?  She said that  she wanted to  come out with  a clothing line  that had dining sleeves  so that you could use it  and then after mealtime  detach the sleeve  and put on  the new dining sleeve  that would be clean.  She's an idiot.  What a fucking  dumb hippie.  What is that gonna do?  That's stupid.  Fuck trees.  Paper grows on trees.  Exactly.  Amazing.  As you know,  I got a kid now  and we tried to use 
[00:14:00]  the diapers,  the...  Cloth?  No, fuck the cloth.  We grew up  with cloth diapers.  They'd have to send out  and the baby shit truck  would come around  and load up  your cloth of baby shit.  Now that I'm a father,  I don't know  how the fuck  our parents did it.  They did it with the...  We grew up  with cloth diapers.  You remember  like the safety pins  and shit?  Safety pins.  Safety pins.  And I remember  early childhood memories  of getting fucking 
[00:14:30]  stabbed on the side  of my body.  They'd nail you  because kids are  moving around.  You got this sharp pin.  Right.  But then my mom,  she talked about it.  Then she took  the shit diaper  and then she would  wash it in the toilet  to get most of it out  and then she would  have to scrub it  by hand  and then throw it  in a washing machine.  It just is ridiculous.  And we're not talking  a hundred years ago.  This was...  No, 98.  Exactly.  This wasn't that long ago  that that's what  they were using. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  So now we got  the disposable diapers  and then they got  the ones that are  environmentally friendly  or whatever, right?  Oh, yeah.  They suck a dick.  They don't stay  on the baby or nothing  so we gave up  on that shit  because we want it  nice and easy for us.  I don't care  if there's asbestos  and it's easy  to clean fucking users.  And the baby wipes,  I guess you're supposed  to use only a couple.  I'm using half  a fucking box  every time my kid shits.  There's nothing  that comes in a roll  or a box  or something  that I will not go...  I like when 
[00:15:30]  the toilet paper roll  just goes...  You know what, though?  My thought on this  is eventually  they'll figure out  how to get rid  of all that shit  in landfills.  You know what?  I've never come across  fucking just toilet paper.  Use toilet paper?  You ever see it?  No, I think that's good  for the environment.  It's been being used  forever.  I really think  that's good compost.  Yeah, well,  fuck this Sheryl Crow shit.  Diapers?  I'm never walking along  and seeing,  well, it's just  a mound of diapers there.  It's not decomposing.  Yeah, I think... 
[00:16:00]  They got that landfill  shit down now.  I think future generations  will figure out  how to break that shit down.  Yeah, they got those bulldozers.  They plow the shit under.  They cover it with plastic.  They got plastic pipes.  They get methane out of it  and then after a while  it just turns into nothingness  and they move  the fucking shit over.  They got that stuff down.  As long as they hide it,  who cares?  Yeah.  I don't give a fuck.  Even the Staten Island  don't stink like it used to.  Right.  Figure that shit out.  I love when you're driving  and you see like  one of these landfill areas.  Yeah.  Dumps, whatever,  and you see like 
[00:16:30]  it's a man-made mountain now.  Yeah.  You know there's some  just awful shit in there.  Horrid shit going on under there.  But they figured out  how to pull like methane  out of those places.  And here's a...  Wow, we're making shit up.  I love this.  Oh, yeah.  So now it moves to this.  Living out on Long Island,  did you ever have to  go to the dumps with your dad?  The old days, the dump, yeah.  Why did you have to go to the dumps?  Usually if some  home improvement thing  was going on.  Oh, really?  And there was like sheet rock 
[00:17:00]  and stuff in the pickup truck.  And you go in  and just back up  and dump it out.  That's what I called it,  the dump.  Well, my family decided  they could save, what,  10 bucks a month  by not having garbage pickup.  Garbage carting service.  On Long Island,  you have to pay your garbage man.  So every weekend,  for a while,  I don't know how long  this lasted,  I should ask my brothers,  on a Saturday,  we had to load up  the fucking  Volkswagen  Garbage?  Yeah,  Volkswagen bus.  It was a Volkswagen bus.  We took the seats out  because we had seven kids. 
[00:17:30]  And we would load it up  with all our garbage.  And we went behind  Alice's restaurant  and dumped off the garbage.  Seven fucking kids  and we decided  we didn't need  garbage pickup anymore  because we wanted to  save a few bucks  that way as well.  So we had to go  to the dump  with my dad.  He must have hated that.  Dude, the smell  in those places.  Holy shit.  How long would it take?  This dump is really bad.  This goes back  so many years  I don't remember anymore,  Jimmy.  I remember it was  at least once a weekend.  My dad was a trade-off guy 
[00:18:00]  at the dump too.  Oh, really?  Oh, he'd dump some shit out  and then look around  and go,  yeah, it looks pretty good.  Really?  I can do something with that.  And then back on.  Ro, I got a new  washing machine  from the dump, Joey.  Yeah, I could fix it.  You don't fix shit  around here anyway.  What the fuck makes you think  you're going to fix  that washing machine?  You know, I come out  with a fucking washing machine  and all I get  is shit from you.  I'll fix it.  I was going to sit  in the basement  like all the other shit  you bring home.  Don't argue. 
[00:18:30]  I have a stomachache.  Faggot, shut up.  Oh, God.  God, was he right?  Oh, was he ever?  Ah, fuck.  I had him stop  the fighting somehow, Jimmy,  so I would say  I had a stomachache.  Never worked.  The smell of a dump  would almost make you puke, though.  Yeah, it was fucking nasty.  What happens with your nose  that you get a smell like that  to the point  where you can't deal?  You just can't deal with life. 
[00:19:00]  It's rotting things.  It's unbelievable, though.  Yeah, yeah.  You can smell shit  as you go through your day,  and it's a little,  a little, like, annoying,  but the smell at the dump yard  will fucking bring you  to your knees.  But you used to be able  to dump anything anywhere.  Oh, yeah.  Now, I haven't been  to the dump  in fucking years,  but I hear you can't just  show up anymore.  Take your shit in  and push everything off.  Like, construction material  goes in one spot,  garbage goes in another, 
[00:19:30]  some metals go in another place.  You gotta fucking, like,  divvy this shit up yourself  when you go there.  Really?  That's why I haven't been there  in ages.  Yeah, I mean,  I miss the days  where you can just  dump your shit off, I guess.  Yeah.  The good old days.  I was gonna move on  to Crazy Jim.  Remember Crazy Jim at AF?  Oh, yeah.  You were talking  about the washing machine.  Do you remember  the story he told?  I don't know  if I should even  get into this  because it doesn't,  he needs to tell it. 
[00:20:00]  Remember the time  he told us stories  about him and his father  moving the fucking,  I think it was the boiler  from the basement  up to the...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The boiler story.  You know what?  I'm gonna stop right here  because I don't think  it's gonna work.  Won't do it justice.  Yeah, because his father  was a raving fucking lunatic.  Yeah, yeah.  And would yell  and scream at the kid.  And remember when  they were hunting  or something  and he stepped on a stick  in the woods?  And it went...  A little stick  and his father  just fucking laid into him.  I think I just...  He was hunting. 
[00:20:30]  I think I just did that  for Anthony.  I'll shut out.  He's hunting.  We should get him  on the air though  to tell some of these  stories again.  Yeah, father...  His father almost killed him  because he stepped on a stick  as a little kid  as they're trying to do  a little hunting together.  And he said  there wasn't even  a deer around.  It wasn't like  they were stalking it.  He was just walking  through the woods  and he's a little kid  with a gun.  Right.  And he stepped on a branch  and it just...  He said it was  the slightest little...  And his father  just laid into him.  Lost his shit  yelling and screaming  now fucking up 
[00:21:00]  the whole hunting thing.  Yeah.  You get an overhead view  every deer within 10 miles  is just running  exactly away from them.  Like cockroaches  when a light goes on.  I guess we made it work.  I miss that fucking guy.  He was nuts.  Crazy Jim was nuts.  He was batshit crazy.  Like hence the crazy Jim.  Yeah.  Hey, they canceled  George Lopez's show.  Yeah, I was bummed about that  because I liked him  as a guy.  Didn't he welcome Conan  with open arms? 
[00:21:30]  I think so.  I might have fucked him up, huh?  No, I think it was  forced on him, of course.  But I think he played it right.  I think it fucked him up, though.  Sure.  I think...  Because they moved  his show later?  Yeah, he was doing  pretty well, I think,  in that slot.  And then they moved  his show later.  And then having Conan  come in,  it's just too much.  You can't watch Conan  and then fucking watch that.  And I don't think  there's enough...  Is Conan doing okay?  ...fans of his.  No?  I read an article  this morning, actually, 
[00:22:00]  that...  TBS says it's very funny.  It says it's funny,  but like,  he's getting low ratings.  TBS says everything  is very funny.  Why is he getting low ratings?  He was supposed to be  the next great  late night talk show host  that got fucked.  No one watches TBS.  Yeah, they said  he's getting like a .5.  Why doesn't anyone  watch TBS?  It's on the fucking TV.  I don't get that shit.  I know.  Why is it that cable shows  do way less than  like the network shows,  but it's right there  on your TV. 
[00:22:30]  It's one channel away.  I think there are still  people that don't have it.  No.  Which is amazing.  People that still just  have regular broadcast  over-the-air television  in the Midwest  and shit like that.  In the year 2011.  Yeah, there's places  that cable doesn't  even go to.  I don't get it.  Isn't that hard?  I was trying to figure  something out to tweet  yesterday, but I couldn't  quite word it right.  Because it's George Lopez  Tonight, is that what  it's called?  Yeah.  Yeah, and I said  they're canceling  George Lopez Tonight,  and I was like,  this would be so much 
[00:23:00]  better with a comma.  They're canceling  George Lopez Tonight.  Like, he doesn't get  any more time.  He's just off the air.  They're canceling  George Lopez Tonight.  Oh.  I wish it was tonight.  Wait.  Yeah, because all you need  is to put a comma in.  They're canceling  George Lopez,  comma,  tonight.  But you have to  understand grammar  to appreciate that.  Yes, and most people  on Twitter.  And I certainly don't  understand grammar,  especially on Twitter.  I'm working on a Home Depot  line with the George Lopez. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm working on that one.  I haven't got it.  I've read a couple  funny ones.  Oh, they already did it?  Yeah, maybe.  I almost retweeted it  with the guy said...  No, I'm not going  to do it then.  Fuck it.  The guy said,  George Lopez's show  has been canceled.  He'll be available  for comments tomorrow  outside of a Home Depot.  I can't do it then.  I was going the other way,  though.  I was going to say  TBS is now going to be  at Home Depot this morning  looking for a replacement  or something.  But I couldn't fucking  word it right.  And now with that line,  I can't do it  because that one's  a better line.  Yeah, I don't know  how well Conan's doing,  to be very honest with you. 
[00:24:00]  I know who is doing well.  Well, I'm biased.  Oh, yeah.  I know who's doing well?  Yeah, he is.  Yeah.  But I honestly don't,  I don't read the ratings.  I have no idea.  Did he get his ratings back?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I can't see.  I don't know if it's  what it was before.  But I don't know if  Letterman is what he was  before either.  I don't know if as many  people are watching  if he's not considering  this cable.  Yeah.  Just Conan  pulled a .5 rating  on Monday  in the 18 to 49 demo,  which is 715,000 viewers, 
[00:24:30]  which this article  describes as anemic,  which is a pretty  typical day  and that George's audience  since he moved  to midnight  has gone down 40%.  Oh.  Ouch.  Wow,  TBS is bummed  at that move,  I guess.  George Lopez  on Monday  had a .2  with 400,000 viewers.  You know,  I haven't even checked out  Conan's show once  on TBS.  Conan can't.  Now that I think about it.  Conan can't pull in  a million people. 
[00:25:00]  No.  A lot of it's a habit,  I think.  Like,  NBC,  CBS,  it really is a weird  fucking habit.  Like,  TBS is not a habit  to go there at night.  Yeah,  and you've always known  since you were  a fucking kid  where those channels are.  But how do you change that?  2, 4, 7,  you know where they are.  ABC, NBC, CBS,  you know where they are.  Even when cable,  like,  you first got cable,  you knew where  those channels were.  And TBS, 
[00:25:30]  I couldn't tell you  off the top of my head  where TBS is right now.  Yeah.  Like,  I don't know,  on my cable system,  I gotta look at the guide.  Plus it's different  for like you and me  and all of you  because I've,  you know,  Optimum  and you've got Fios  and he's got Time Warner.  Yeah,  it's just,  and it goes to show you,  you make things  even a little difficult  to find.  Ah,  forget it.  And that's fucked up  and that's the problem  we've always had here.  Yeah.  That's serious.  You know what,  yeah,  it's funny you should say that  because I spend a lot of time  in Philly,  as you know,  and when I'm just hanging out 
[00:26:00]  trying to watch TV,  I give up  because everything's different  down there.  Everything's different.  I'm like,  I don't know where anything is.  I feel like I'm in another country.  I'm like,  where the fuck is all the channels?  Yeah.  What was I trying to watch?  Oh,  I was trying to watch golf.  Something really simple.  Yeah.  And I know it's on a network.  Across.  I was on the,  why wouldn't they all  get together  and just make it all  the same channel?  Make it all the same  because they hate each other 
[00:26:30]  and they don't want  anybody else to succeed.  I was on,  I was doing a little test  of a compound show  and I was plugging,  of course,  this very radio show,  which I do all the time.  Oh,  that's really nice.  I do it all the time.  Thank you.  And because I say,  yeah,  on the O.P. and Anthony show,  which can be heard  six to 11,  I say,  with the same thing.  Six to 11  on Sirius,  one,  Sirius,  one,  and I found myself,  I'm like,  I don't even know  what the hell channel  we're on anymore. 
[00:27:00]  I tried to.  Is it 105,  XM 206?  We're on,  I'm going to try this.  Hold on.  I know,  I finally figured out  we're on XM 105.  I do know that.  Oh,  it's XM 105,  Sirius 206.  I think it's Sirius 2,  we're in the 200s.  Two,  uh,  uh,  two,  uh,  two oh nine.  No,  Ant was right.  It's 206.  It is 206.  But it's also like,  I was at a wedding  and somebody was like,  oh,  so what channel?  I have a Sirius XM  in my car.  And I said,  well,  do you have Sirius 
[00:27:30]  or do you have XM?  I know.  And they go,  I don't,  what do you mean?  I have Sirius XM.  Right,  people don't know this.  I go,  well,  it depends if,  and these guys down the hall  and we'll keep it brief today,  I promise,  but you know,  we made fun of them  for changing the channels  and not syncing it up.  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense.  It should be the same channel.  Because just like Sam,  someone,  uh,  someone in my life asked me,  oh,  I got,  oh,  it was my stupid pediatrician.  She goes,  I got Sirius.  I didn't know what channel to tell her. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah,  you're like,  I did say 209,  by the way.  And you have to,  you know,  say,  do you have the best of XM package  on your Sirius?  And then you like,  throw that fucking monkey wrench in.  There's a few steps  before you can actually give the number.  Our name is on the channel.  I know.  And I don't know what channel it is  off the top of my head.  I have to always think.  I know.  I have to think too.  E-Rock?  Wait,  is it,  it's 208.  No.  No.  206.  206.  I'm serious.  I'm serious.  I do know.  If you have the best of XM.  I really do know,  finally it's XM 105. 
[00:28:30]  I got that in my head.  But the fucking Sirius one,  I can't figure out.  If it's XM 105.  It should have been Sirius 105.  Then it's,  it's Sirius 206.  So you go 105,  206.  Right.  It's almost like it's in order for someone.  E-Rock's got something to add.  I was at a wedding a couple weeks ago  and people were saying that  they used to listen to the show  because they moved the channels,  they can't get it anymore.  And they have like a 2009,  2010 edition car.  Yeah.  And the radios are too old 
[00:29:00]  to switch it up that high.  They got us at 197 when we were there.  But now that it's 206,  they just can't pick it up at all.  The radios can't find it.  I have XM and Sirius accounts.  I have separate XM Sirius accounts  where I'm,  I'm paying for them.  Yeah.  I'm just like,  one car is XM,  one car is Sirius.  You know what's even sadder?  I'm Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi Opie.  I can't listen to our channel in my car  because it was too much of a hassle to get it. 
[00:29:30]  To just get it right.  I don't have our channel in my fucking car.  You cannot listen to the channel.  Because I live in Manhattan,  I rarely have the car out.  I have it out every other weekend probably.  It works out to be.  And every time I forget that,  I have to keep the radio on,  call these idiots,  tell them to fuck in.  And I just don't feel like doing it.  Is that 1-800-these-idiots?  Is that how you get through?  It's actually pretty fast.  And I know it's my fault,  but I'm telling you,  since the channel changed,  I don't have our channel in my own vehicle.  That is sad. 
[00:30:00]  Just tell everybody you get the app.  The app is easy.  Oh yeah.  Don't even start with the app.  And then when it craps out?  I wasn't even actually going.  I always listen to music on the app.  But I never have problems.  Ours is a crap.  I mean,  the channel's easy to find.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  The channel's easy to find on the app.  206.  That's right.  There you go.  So I have to write that down on a card  and have it in my pocket.  See,  I know that it's 105 and 206.  I just get confused as to which is which.  Is it Sirius 105? 
[00:30:30]  No,  it's XM 105.  And I love how they justify it down the hall all the time  and they think it makes sense to them.  It doesn't make sense.  It should have been on the same fucking channel  on both Sirius and XM.  Especially the high profile shows.  Some of these shit channels  that eventually will go away,  who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  But if it's a high profile show like ours,  it should have just been 105 on both  or 206 on both.  I don't give a fuck.  Who's 105 on fucking Sirius then?  There is none.  Then make one.  Then call it 105. 
[00:31:00]  I think it might have been too close to Howard's shit.  Then do 206.  It's the premium channels.  You can't get best of XM on a channel that low.  Best of XM.  But they own a company.  They could have figured it out.  The technology in the Sirius units themselves  won't allow it.  Yeah, you run it.  It's terrible.  Tweak the satellite.  Do something.  It didn't.  It's an astronaut's up there.  It didn't do us any good,  I'm telling you. 
[00:31:30]  And I didn't even give a fuck  they moved us down from XM.  They said,  oh, it's good dial placement.  Whatever, man.  They should have made it the same on both.  That's what they should have done  before anything.  Make it real easy.  200.  200.  200.  Yeah, 105.  187.  206.  That's murder.  It's hard for us to remember that  because it used to be Sirius 197 XM 202.  Oh, boy.  So it used to be the XM was the 200  and the Sirius was the 100.  Now it's the other way around.  Now it's the other way around.  Sirius 206 XM 105. 
[00:32:00]  That's right.  And the only reason I knew it was 202  was because of Ronnie B, you know,  202 friends.  202 friends and all that.  So now that Twitter account's fucked.  Well, no, he left it because he says  it's for like the old schoolers.  Old school, yeah.  So is there now a 206 friends?  No, it's 202 friends.  But that doesn't make sense anymore.  Well, if you know, you know.  If you know, you know.  But what about the new people?  That's logic.  They'll figure it out.  Yeah.  You can.  The newbies will get there.  Noobs.  Noob is not a noob word anymore. 
[00:32:30]  I hate noob.  My friend's in the mob  and he drives a luxury Cadillac  and he said he couldn't get our channel.  He was pissed.  A Cadillac.  Cadillac.  He's in the mob?  Yeah.  Why'd you do that?  I think it's cool.  It would have stopped right there.  Don't you know how to work, Jimmy?  He wants us to ask questions.  He has a friend in the mob.  Shut up, Sam.  That was just a throwaway thought.  But now we have to ask what he did, Jimmy.  All I want to know is 
[00:33:00]  what's his name?  I've talked about him before.  He doesn't like.  He likes a leaner burger.  Because he's...  Oh.  I don't know.  We got tired, Jimmy, today.  I can tell already.  Does he hang out with Joey Hey Hey Hey?  Yeah.  Hey Hey Hey Now.  Joey.  Bill Turkey Burger.  Bill Turkey Burger.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What family is he in?  He's so sleepy. 
[00:33:30]  Bill Tetley is ruining my manager's marriage.  He can't stop singing it to his wife.  And he said they were talking about Gene Kelly.  And he just went, wah, Gene Kelly.  No, that doesn't even make sense.  He's like, it's not even Bill Tetley.  Shut up.  Her friend was trying to find a job.  So she asked Jonathan for help.  So he emailed her and said, look, they might be looking on the Bill Tetley show for help.  And his wife screamed at him.  She said, that's not funny.  Why would you say that?  I'm like, why'd you do that?  He goes, I just knew it would get back to my wife.  And I said, Bill Tetley. 
[00:34:00]  It's so great.  It's ruining his marriage.  I'm so happy.  Do you get tired of those long flights, like the coast-to-coast flights?  Yeah, sure.  I'm okay with them.  But you don't sleep?  I was writing last night.  On the plane.  I have fun, though.  I like coming in tired.  It's fun.  Oh, I know.  I don't mind.  I like coming in tired, too.  It's every day.  But I can't imagine not sleeping on that flight.  Yeah, you're a good sleeper.  I'm not a good sleeper. 
[00:34:30]  I love to sleep on planes.  I slept going out.  Going out's okay.  I slept during the day.  I slept for most of my flight going out.  Coming home, I just couldn't.  I just couldn't fucking sleep.  You had a nice little seat that went all the way back and everything.  Yeah, but I didn't recline for like two and a half hours.  I'm gone in those fucking planes.  I put the music on, put the little earbuds in, and turn on some music, and I'm fucking done.  Virgin America feeds you the second you get on the plane.  They get the meals out on the night flights. 
[00:35:00]  They're great.  Dude, they're fucking.  Yeah, I've heard Virgin.  You're fucking in your descent before they start making coffee.  Fucking.  Virgin America is great, dude.  They just fucking, as soon as the plane takes off, literally the fucking flight tend to stand up,  and they just roll down the aisle because you're still in such a steep ascent.  You're still in a steep climb.  They have mountain climbing gear on there, rappelling down the aisle, feeding you.  The fucking Sherpa brought me my Diet Coke. 
[00:35:30]  So I just fucking ate and then rode for it.  I just got caught up writing, and I was like, well, that's fucking two and a half hours from the flight.  I haven't even reclined yet.  Wow.  But that's like constructive.  Yeah.  You're writing.  Let's see.  I'll see how it is when I look at it tomorrow after I sleep.  Sometimes you write things you think are genius, and then you look at them, you're like, I'm terrible.  I was going to say that.  Makes Jim a dull boy, and he's just stacked.  I was going to say, you wrote the same thing between a half straight hours.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just throwing a rubber ball against the wall, and my fucking ugly skinny wife tried  to read it, so I chased her with an axe. 
[00:36:00]  Fucking cunt.  Hey.  Flight attendants must have loved that.  Is this new car thing a real issue, or can they get around that?  Because everyone's calling now, and it's really bothering me.  I'll look.  Bought new car on Saturday.  Can't even get you guys.  Well, that's because you have to have the best of XM.  Is that all it is?  Yeah.  I'm pretty sure that it's because people don't get the best of XM, and then they think that  the channel's not there.  It's like, it's not a lot of money.  Just call.  So if you.  Hold on.  Okay.  Call.  Hold on. 
[00:36:30]  Hold on.  Yeah.  Say you got the best of XM.  Yeah.  You get rid of your car.  You get a new car.  You're just assuming you still have the best of XM?  You have to.  You know what I mean?  Or do you have to call them back up and go, look, I am a subscriber.  I got the best of XM, but I got a new car.  Yeah, because the new cars come with like a year of free service, so your subscription  is not transferring over.  You're just getting a new subscription, so you'd have to call again and have a new best  of XM package put on the new radio.  Yeah, you gotta call again. 
[00:37:00]  What?  What the?  Who the?  What?  You probably do it on the computer, too.  So it's not a real issue.  Yeah, I think so.  Cars could get it.  Any car could get best of XM.  I believe that cars can get best of XM.  I sure hope so.  I sure hope they weren't that stupid.  Because anybody who's complained about it in the beginning figured it out.  Just called and got the best of XM.  Yeah, yeah.  You just have to get, if you have Sirius, you need the best of XM to hear us.  Best of XM.  We had a guy that was.  We're the best.  We had a guy that was jerking off, and we didn't get to him in time. 
[00:37:30]  What?  And someone showed up, so he had to put his penis back in his pants, and he came in his  pants, and he wanted to tell us.  But now he's gone.  I'm glad you told us.  If that guy's around, please call back.  That's a shame.  I know who you are, by the way.  That's like a nice guy.  What's worse than after you cum, if you let a little bit on the tip and it sticks to your  underpants?  Like, did you ever realize, like, oh no, the cum is...  And then you pull it back and it pinches your cock head?  Because it's stuck?  No.  To your little slug trail?  No.  Not really.  Yeah, you gotta really fucking clean the head. 
[00:38:00]  You got some evil cum.  Yeah, my cum is very weird.  It smells.  Oh, god damn it.  It's fucking...  You gotta change your diet.  If I don't fucking blow a load for, like, two or three days, man, it fucking...  It slinky walks over my fucking hands.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  It's like the blob in the fucking bowling alley.  Marching around.  Stuck on some bum's arm.  It's running around trying to shake it off. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, I gotta put up my arm by the air conditioner.  Let's go to Army Bob.  Army Bob's been waiting to talk to us.  You invade a country.  Boom, you know, while you...  Okay.  I'm getting off work.  What?  Hi, Army Bob.  Yeah, what's up, Army Bob?  What are you doing?  Just hanging out in the backyard.  Got off work a little while ago.  Have we talked to you before?  You sound familiar.  I'm...  I'm...  I'm a frequent flyer. 
[00:39:00]  Are you in...  You're in PA, right?  Yes.  And you're in your yard?  Of course.  And you're...  You're having a few beverages?  Certainly.  What's your up...  It's my five o'clock on the other side of the clock for you.  Ah.  Name your poison.  What are you drinking?  Beer.  Oh, okay.  How many have you had?  Eighty. 
[00:39:30]  Only in the past month.  What?  Eighty in the past month.  Eighty.  How about today?  Today?  Counting yesterday or not?  Yeah, so just count yesterday.  A few.  What do you...  What do you...  What do you...  What do you do?  I guess you work a night shift?  A variable shift.  What do you do, sir?  You could be the vaguest guy ever.  Yeah.  You haven't answered one question yet. 
[00:40:00]  No, you're very vague.  What do you do for a living, Army Bob?  I'm...  I patrol.  I work with and for law enforcement.  Oh, boy.  Are you a cop?  No.  No.  A soldier at best.  This is like a...  This is like Stephen Wright.  A riddle.  A riddle.  Yeah.  Stephen Wright-ish.  Yeah.  You're a riddle.  Are you guys sitting on an awful lawn chair?  Let's see if we can...  No, not in the lawn chair or an armchair. 
[00:40:30]  What are you sitting in then, Bob?  I'm standing.  Oh.  All right.  He answered a question.  That's good.  He's smoking a butt?  I'll get there.  Are you a security guard?  Yes, he is.  So to speak, yeah.  Not far off, Ant.  All right.  So you're a security guard at some type of installation or company?  Installation.  No, that was 25 years ago. 
[00:41:00]  What kind of things do you protect?  Are you the guard in a giant dildo warehouse?  No.  No.  I take care of a community.  I don't care to speak of which community.  All right.  Here's what he does.  He works the gate at the...  No, not a gate.  I'm a patrol guy.  You work with retarded people.  Some of them.  Most of them.  Especially tourists.  Correctional officer.  New Jersey.  Oh, so what you do...  He's like a...  Is you're in that car that drives around with the yellow beacon on top, up and down the streets. 
[00:41:30]  I got a light bar and a siren and a bear horn.  But it's not a red light, right?  He works at a 7-Eleven as a security guard.  You're funny, Oop.  It's not a red light, though.  Your light's on the top of your car.  No, no, no, no.  They're yellow.  I have a microphone that's a direct line.  He's the yellow light guy that drives around the neighborhood. 
[00:42:00]  A blue lighter.  Oh, the blue light.  Well, blue and yellow, it pretty much means...  I don't have to worry.  Well, which is better, blue or yellow?  I would say blue would probably be better than yellow.  Oh, right on there, Army Bob.  Yeah.  Thank you, Ann.  I have a...  In my neighborhood, yellow light guy drives around.  Oh, he's just...  He's a snowplow guy.  No, no.  He's a security guy.  They have a security company that drives around the neighborhood.  They patrol the neighborhood.  Do you have to pay for that?  And probably with my fucking umpteen million taxes. 
[00:42:30]  They check the schools, the yellow lighters.  Well, yeah, I've seen them up at the schools, and then they go up and down all the streets  in our neighborhood.  There's a few of them.  Yeah, you can see a watch patrol in my neighborhood.  Yeah?  In geriatrics.  Oh, so you live in an old people's neighborhood?  Eh, not so much.  He is so vague.  It's vague Bob. 
[00:43:00]  They're also calling him, Kevin from Connecticut, smarmy, Bob.  Smarmy?  I don't like that.  Smarmy, dude.  Smarmy.  No, you're very vague.  That's good.  Do you wear a uniform?  Used to.  Kudos to your brother, Joe, Ann.  What happened?  101.  I was fourth ID.  Oh, Joe was 82nd.  Here we go.  82nd.  Oh.  Joe was 82nd.  My mistake.  My mistake.  Fourth of the 68th armor. 
[00:43:30]  I was over there in the shit in Desert Storm.  Third of the 29th in Desert Storm there, Jimmy.  I was there.  Who?  Third of the 29th field artillery.  I kicked that statue over.  You were the guy?  Yeah.  Oh, you were the one in Gettysburg.  You were the one in Gettysburg.  What?  You silly goose.  So, Bob.  Pull my chain in.  Where'd that come from?  Google that, honey. 
[00:44:00]  Hey, Bob.  Why are you calling?  Yeah, yeah.  Helen Bergeron.  You know what?  We like you all, but why are you calling?  Very good question, Opie.  Gang up.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Let's go.  No, there's no ganging up.  No gang up.  Very paranoid.  Very simple question.  I'm not paranoid.  Why are you calling us, Army Bob?  I love you guys.  Oh, okay.  I remember your lonely stories of sitting in Central Park talking to your friends when you started in New York in, what, 98, 99?  He's good. 
[00:44:30]  Very good, brother.  Yeah.  Brother.  I love you guys.  That's why I called.  Oh, thank you.  Well, Army Bob, we love you, too.  Yeah.  Up yours, Whitey.  Army Bob is a strange sort, but he's interesting.  Are you near Amish?  You know, my girlfriend was nuzzled by the breast by Jimmy Norton. 
[00:45:00]  Was she really?  In Scranton, a few years back.  How did I nuzzle her breast?  Did we take a photo of it together?  No, she wanted a motorboat, stupid, and you frickin' lost your chance.  I don't remember.  Does she have big bosoms?  Yes.  Bosoms.  38 double D.  Damn.  Those are big bosoms.  What are they holding up, or are they kind of sagging now, Army Bob?  They're hanging tough.  They're doing all right?  Yeah, not too bad. 
[00:45:30]  I love my girl.  That's good.  You love everybody.  My, uh...  No, not so much.  Not so much.  My, uh...  Not so fuckin' much.  My, uh...  We went and got my son a haircut yesterday.  How'd that work out?  Well, no, it's about big boobs.  Uh-huh.  And it's this big, over-the-top black woman with huge boobs.  Of course.  Really nice lady, by the way.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, she looks at me, she's like, your son likes boobies. 
[00:46:00]  Oh.  Because I was looking down, like, at my Twitter or something, because I was kind of bored.  And I guess while I was looking down, he was fuckin' grabbing her huge fuckin' boobs.  Ooh.  Whoa.  What do you say to that?  Like, uh...  Call him a race trainer.  Slap him.  Boy.  And then she goes, at least you know he's a real boy.  You call him boy.  That's what I just said.  Yeah.  But maybe, I don't know, maybe the gay babies are grabbing boobs, too, because they don't 
[00:46:30]  know yet.  I don't know.  Of course they are.  They don't know what they are.  Yeah.  But she goes, he's a real boy.  That's obvious.  He's grabbing my boobies.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  They were a little too sloppy, so I'm gonna have to have a conversation with him when he  gets a little older.  Yeah.  A little too sloppy, eh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway, Army Bob, anything else?  Nah, I'm good.  Thanks.  He's punching out.  All right, Army Bob.  Very nice talking to you.  Call back sometime, all right, Army Bob?  You're a delight.  Yeah, you certainly are. 
[00:47:00]  With that, I think we can go to break.  You want to play My Strange Addiction going into break, or do we want to play it in show  so we can comment about it, Ant?  What do you think?  Mr. Jim hasn't heard it yet.  All right.  Mr. Jim will hear this after the break.  Yeah, that's true.  We should do that.  After the break, we'll do this.  Yeah.  So I'm sure E-Rock's got something going into break.  We will listen now to see what he has.  Sirius XM.  This is the virus.  All right, this is a little weird.  It's going to be Patrice O'Neal, Warren Hayes.  Man, this is all spoken.  Man, you know I've been enjoying things that kings and queens will never have. 
[00:47:30]  In fact, kings and queens can never get, and they don't even know about it.  In good times, great googly moogly.  Great googly moogly.  I have had my fun, if I'd never get well no more. 
[00:48:00]  I have had my fun, if I'd never get well no more.  I have had my fun, if I'd never get well no more. 
[00:48:30]  But I said I've had spent more money than a millionaire.  Because if I had kept all my money that I'd already spent, I would have been a millionaire a long time ago. 
[00:49:00]  And women, ooh, women.  Great googly moogly.  Please write my mama.  Tell her the shape I'm in.  Tell her to pray for me. 
[00:49:30]  Forgive me for my sin.  Hey, that's all right. 
[00:50:00]  Patrice, that's all right.  That's Holland Wolves.  You got to listen to Holland Wolves, though, man.  That's all right, though.  You got a voice on you, Patrice.  I'm going down slow.  He just said, tell my mama I live.  I'm out of here.  No, I said play some music.  Your job is the easiest job on staff.  He told me to get rid of it, so that's what I did.  No, get rid of the sweeper, but give me some fucking music bed.  God damn it.  It's the easiest job.  I used to do that job when I was 12. 
[00:50:30]  That was hilarious.  I'm 28 years old.  Do the job, right.  Play a sweeper.  Don't play a sweeper.  Play music.  Don't play a sweeper.  No.  No.  I said don't play a fucking sweeper, because I wanted to promote that.  That was Big Mama Prods with Warren Haynes.  And then he said, just give me some music.  And just give me some music.  I'm glad I didn't hear, nor did he tell me.  I apologize.  Oh, boy.  Whatever, dude.  Oh, boy.  Wake the fuck up.  Join the program.  I was like, I knew there was going to be trouble when you said no sweeper.  I was like, oh, boy.  Every time we change it, it fucks up.  Oh, boy.  It's like Rain Man. 
[00:51:00]  And he's got his set things he knows how to do.  And if you change it up a little bit, there could be trouble.  That was Warren Haynes.  He came in, and Big Mama Prods decided to try to sing as Warren Haynes played.  And that was a one take by Patrice O'Neal.  You're fucking around.  There you have it.  The phone just answered itself.  Who's there?  Hello?  Hello.  Oh, hi. 
[00:51:30]  Who's this?  Who's this?  Army Bob again.  He's magic.  He can figure out how to make the phone just plunk down and answer.  My hands are up here, man.  How the fuck did the phone answer itself?  Ope was pop-locking.  He didn't touch the phone.  That's right.  I didn't do artillery like that.  All right, Bob.  What else you got?  Because we've got to move on now.  Yeah, we've got to show it.  All right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Chip over there stepped on my headquarters battalion 3rd by the 29th Regiment.  No, I didn't step on nothing. 
[00:52:00]  I was over there.  I saw the shit.  Yeah, okay.  You were there after I was done with it.  I was running through there just knocking everything over.  You were talking to me, Jimmy.  Bullshit.  I was got sand all over my feet.  Oh, that was the Jersey Shore.  You probably stuck him up Snooki's ass and got sand.  Ugh.  Yeah.  This guy's good.  Snooki's blowing us off, by the way.  Good bye.  Thank you, Army Bob.  Yeah, the Army Bob.  Why don't you call yourself Navy Bob or something? 
[00:52:30]  I heard you.  Have some good lunch here.  Food.  We got Pauly D.  We got Dina.  We got Vinny.  We got Uncle Nino all coming in next week.  We have Pauly next week?  That's good.  And Snooki's blowing us off.  Today.  She's in today, right?  What time?  But she went to our show.  10.30.  Like 10.30 she'll be here.  You don't have one?  No, I didn't mention Snooki.  I want a picture of that Enchantress.  I got a picture of Snooki.  But fucking Roland got nervous at the Jets game, so it's blurry.  She's an asshole. 
[00:53:00]  Snooki?  Gives a shit about Snooki.  Yeah, she's becoming a little...  Fuck her.  A little pompous.  A little bitchy.  A little...  Snooki.  Full of herself.  Well, I heard on the news this morning that she's not talking about hooking up anymore  and things, and she's looking to settle down and have some Guido children.  She's not even Italian.  Whatever.  Whatever.  She's Chilean.  She's Guatemalan or something.  Fucking, yeah.  She's one of those people that wear those derby hats and pick coffee off the sides of mountains. 
[00:53:30]  Look at that body.  Get out of here.  Oh, God.  She probably has a nice puss.  Dude, the derby hat will make me laugh all day.  I hate those derby hats they wear down there in Peru.  There's two women in my neighborhood.  They collect cans.  Yeah.  And they're Peruvian, I guess.  Yeah.  And they wear their derby hats as they're going through the garbage, collecting their bottles  and cans.  Like, how did that happen?  That must have...  It's not a man.  That's a man's hat. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  A derby must have fallen out of a plane over Peru, and they just put it on and went like,  yeah, that'll work.  You're looking at Kentucky derby hats.  You just put in derby hat, Sam, and it's showing the ornate, giant women Kentucky derby  hat.  No, you gotta go...  You gotta put Peru...  Peru?  Yeah.  Derby.  Perfect, man.  Perfect.  Can I tell you how much I hate women who wear fucking men's fedoras and men's...  There she is.  There you go.  That's Snooki.  That's a man's hat. 
[00:54:30]  There's Snooki right there.  You're right.  She's wearing a fucking...  A young Clemenza hat.  Yeah.  It's the hat.  Young Clemenza wore when he got the rug.  A young Clemenza hat.  Vito.  Vito.  That is exactly what that is.  It's the same hat.  That fucking hat stinks.  That is horrible. 
[00:55:00]  It really is.  She should be fucking finding a little floating disappointment in her New Jersey pool in that  fucking hat.  Whoa!  Yeah, that's what it is, too.  Awful Abbot Costello.  It's the Lou Costello hat.  It had blows.  I hate women that wear them.  And Snooki looks like that woman in that photo.  Yeah, she does.  So who is she to blow us off, man?  It's the second time.  Huh?  It's the second time she's done it.  What the fuck, man?  She's a frady cat. 
[00:55:30]  She's no one special.  She's on a show that's doing killer ratings, but, I mean, all she does is hang out and just...  I don't even know what she does.  Killer ratings just amazes me.  Nine million.  It's going to be the younger demo.  Yeah.  They love it.  Is that her naked?  That's an old picture.  When she looked, like, sort of okay.  Yeah, yeah.  That's like...  I'd plug a hole.  That's not bad for Snooki. 
[00:56:00]  She used to be...  She had an eating disorder, she said, in high school.  Well, it worked.  Yeah, she ate this order.  She ate that order.  You guys want to see something really hot?  Well, what do we got?  What is that?  Is that all it is?  Hold on, hold on.  I can't see what it is.  Is that someone jerking off driving?  Yeah.  Did you film that?  No!  Is that in a Prius?  Are they in a BMW X6? 
[00:56:30]  What that is?  Wow, they are driving and jerking off.  I used to whack it between Geneseo and Long Island.  I used to do that when I drove by myself.  But I wouldn't pull my pants all the way down  and my fucking ankles like this fucking weirdo.  They're pulled all the way down.  All the way?  He's completely naked in his clothes.  He loves jerking off.  Sure, who doesn't?  If you want to see this, I'm not retweeting it.  Fuck it.  I'll just give Pirate Film Co. all the credit today.  There must have been a trucker, I guess, going by. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Laughed his ass off.  On the way to the convoy.  Yeah.  We got us a jerker.  Oh.  You got a bass bear on you?  Hello there, there's a bear coon.  Fucking idiots.  Anthony, I'm surprised you didn't know the name of the hat.  You want to give it one more shot?  Because I got the answer.  I didn't come up with it.  Bowler hat.  You knew that?  Yes.  Yeah.  I just call it a derby.  I honestly didn't know it was a war.  I call it a derby so I can relate with it.  Because a bowler hat is very hard for people to know what that is. 
[00:57:30]  They think it's some guy going bowling.  Yeah, either that or they're eating pasta out of it or something.  Yeah.  Oh, like a bowl.  That's what I said.  Cocksucker.  Tony in Ohio.  Tony.  How's it going this morning, guys?  Good.  Hello.  I'm waiting for Iraq to apologize properly.  Oh, shit.  What's the matter?  Iraq, you're fucking...  Are you going to apologize properly?  Stupid IZOD shirt open at the neck.  E?  Close it with a noose. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, Iraq.  E?  Why step on the left?  I love it.  All right.  We're even now.  Go ahead, Erwin.  Now we're good now.  Fuck it.  Tony, let's go.  What do you got, buddy?  Hey, I don't watch that show because I could give a damn.  Language.  The reason maybe Snooki's blowing you off is because for, you know, two, three years, you've  called her a fat little fire plug and bowling ball.  All right.  We might have said her ass looks like an elephant's ass. 
[00:58:30]  But let me tell you something.  We went into this nice.  That all started when she blew us off the last time.  Yeah.  And she's been on other shows where people have said stuff about her.  Oh, God.  Look at her ass.  She's becoming full of herself is what's happening.  And she really thinks that she's going to parlay this into a real career when they recast Jersey  Short.  It's just not going to happen.  Parlay.  I've actually said she's the apple of my eye.  I'm not defending her.  I'm just, I mean, I agree with you guys, but I'm just saying you're your own worst enemies. 
[00:59:00]  Her ass is loosey-goosey.  It's not good.  It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, it doesn't look, like, very shaky.  Looks like cafeteria lady arms.  Yeah, yeah.  Put on her eyes.  I think that'll get her on the show.  Fuck her, then.  Spank her and play with her puss.  Make it all wet.  Just punch her in it.  She'd probably be about as good an interview as Paris was, because, you know.  Nah, she'd be better than Paris.  She's more personality than Paris Hilton.  She's not hot like Paris.  That fucking ass is deplorable. 
[00:59:30]  It's just, I can't.  That's hot, right?  It's not that bad.  Look at that.  Look at it.  It's underslung.  Nice, right?  It looked, it just, it looked like she wiped in that one, too.  You wouldn't lick it?  No, would I not lick Snooki's ass.  Can I ask you a question?  Sure.  In your years of fucking.  Yeah.  Have you ever had a lift up an ass to get to the pussy?  No.  I don't think so, no. 
[01:00:00]  You know, when you're from behind and all, and usually everything's nicely displayed.  You've never had to kind of, like, kind of lift to see where everything is.  Oh, my God, no.  Snooki has one of those.  Wow.  Yeah, that is an awful, oh, it's just, it is an elephant ass.  I'm sorry.  Troy would tear that up.  Troy would tear nothing up.  Troy is all talk.  Wow, all talk.  No fucking game.  All talk.  Where's Troy today?  He's not here. 
[01:00:30]  Fuck!  I love that kid.  His big, dumb, R-gang baseball hats that he wears.  I fucking hate Troy's flat-billed baseball hats.  R-gang.  The way the kids wear them.  Yeah?  Yeah.  His 19 fucking 50s hats.  His fucking hats blow.  All right, well, we'll still have fun with Pauly D and Vinny and Dina, that fucking pig,  and Uncle Nino.  She likes being called a pig.  There's no way that that's true.  She's proud of it, man. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  She's proud of being a pig on Jersey Shore.  She's made herself into one.  She's acted like one.  Why wouldn't she enjoy that?  Yeah.  She loves it.  Can I get a pic with Snookster?  You could try.  What is that picture of Troy Kwan that I'm seeing there?  Ew.  That's this fucking cool guy picture.  His hands are out like he's doing, like, hey, ew.  And it's in some kind of a fisheye lens thing.  That's kind of a cool picture now.  Where his hands are.  You don't like it?  It's cool if you didn't know him.  If I didn't know he was a phone screener who gets yelled at.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:01:30]  It almost looks rock star.  Are you saying he's over-representing himself?  Yeah, exactly.  Over-rep.  That dumb hat.  There's that hat.  Yep.  There it is.  He should have it turned sideways and be following Spanky around everywhere.  Jimmy, I heard some things about Jane Fonda and you.  What'd you hear?  Oh, there's some talk going on in the hall.  Oh, shit.  You got your picture with her and then basically said how much you hate her after she left.  But I didn't say where she could hear it.  No, I know.  Did you get a picture with her?  Yes. 
[01:02:00]  Were you both sitting on an anti-aircraft replacement?  Yes.  She was walking by and I went, like, I have a picture!  She turned and embraced you thinking you were a commie.  I was told that it was an awkward meeting.  Yes.  Because she thought you worked for the talent department or something.  And you told her, I have to make a flight.  Can we get a picture?  I'll tell you what it is.  Literally, she stopped.  I gave Roland the camera.  And he is a nervous idiot. 
[01:02:30]  But when she walked in, I shook her hand.  I'm like, hello, Ms. Fonda.  And she shook my hand.  She looks great for 70.  I mean, she looks really good.  Would you do her?  Oh, yeah.  And I'm like, can we take a picture?  Because I have to go to the airport.  And she just stopped and, like, thank you.  And she went, all right.  It was literally, maybe for two seconds she stopped.  And that was all I needed.  But after, I didn't say I hated her when she walked.  She was gone.  And one of the girls who I think, there was a really hot girl that I think works for Liam.  She's, I don't know her name.  But I think she's a talent.  She's, like, an intern or something. 
[01:03:00]  Probably an intern.  But she was sitting there.  And she goes, I don't know who she is.  She's a young girl.  She's quite 21.  That's funny.  And, you know, people were trying to explain who Jane Fonda was.  And I'm like, I hate her.  How does she have any fans?  She's a talented actress.  She pissed off most of America.  Yeah, the libs love her.  Hey, very good question coming in from Silly Goose.  Would you guys rather fuck Jane Fonda at 73?  She's 73, supposedly.  She looks amazing, dude.  Or Snooki.  Oh.  Give me a picture of Jane Fonda.  I don't have a threesome on both of them. 
[01:03:30]  You got your picture with Jane Fonda?  Yeah, she looks pretty good.  All right, let me take a look at Jimmy's picture of Jane Fonda.  Let me get the motherfucker out of my motherfucking bed.  And this is going to be tough for you, man.  You've got to have an open mind here.  Can I say I just wouldn't fuck that day?  No, because Snooki, there's all sorts of problems there.  Because she's not the right race for you.  And she's got healthy ass.  No, the race thing doesn't bother me with Snooki.  Jane Fonda is pure white.  But politically, you fucking hate her.  This is a tough question for Anthony Comey.  I could not fucking... 
[01:04:00]  You have to pick one.  Shit.  You have to.  Why are you still on the phone?  Exactly.  What are you talking about, sir?  You're just a talkie, Lou.  I got to go with the stupid fucking Snooki.  Tony?  Yeah.  We're going to let you go now.  Thank you, sir.  Don't do that.  You'll crush me.  All right.  All right.  Stay right there.  Just pipe in when you feel something.  I got to go with the stupid fucking Snooki.  Well, could you look at the Jane Fonda picture that Jimmy just took? 
[01:04:30]  I was looking at these.  She looks good.  What is he showing you?  What is it, his dick?  Why wouldn't it be?  And people go, don't you find it weird that you've seen Jim Norton's dick?  I'm like, no.  That's like a whole load of Jimmy.  He just has pictures.  He's just, yeah, look.  We're all buddies who gives a shit.  Hold on.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Where is she?  Where is the bitch?  Did I love it yet?  Oh, you know why?  I'm running out of space on my fucking iPhone, man. 
[01:05:00]  Motherfucker.  How do I turn my phone back on?  Hold on.  Just act sexy in front of it.  Oh, God.  You didn't show me the Jane Fonda?  Oh, I thought I had my iPhone.  Ant's going Snooki.  I'm leaning toward Jane Fonda, but I've got to see the picture.  Snooki.  You would go Snooki?  Snooki.  Hold on.  God, I'm my fucking ugly.  Hi, who's this?  Army Bob. 
[01:05:30]  No, no, no.  Tony, hold on, man.  There's Jane Fonda.  We've got someone else on the line.  Who's this?  Army Bob.  Oh, God.  What the fuck?  What's up, Army Bob?  I'm not tired yet.  That's great, man.  I would, I, yeah, that, uh, I think I, I think I would do Jane Fonda at 73, Ant.  Let me say.  Jane Fonda before Snooki.  That's what Army Bob's saying?  That is as great as she can possibly look. 
[01:06:00]  She's sort of looking grandma-ish, though, is the problem.  I am not, uh, into that fucking, I'm not saying you have to like it, Ant, but you gotta pick  one.  No, that's a grandma.  You're gonna go Snooki?  I have to, just based on the youth factor.  You guys are nuts.  I'm sorry.  I, I, it, get, in, in the Barbarella days, I'd have been all over Jane Fonda instead of  the Snookster.  Boy, you're, boy, you're really saying something there.  Yeah, I, I, I know.  But it's like, you're giving me this, this horrid decision to make. 
[01:06:30]  John McCain would have fucked her back then.  Army Bob would go Peter Fonda.  What's that?  Army Bob would go Peter Fonda.  We heard you.  I know you heard me.  You hear me again, too, bitch.  I guess that is the way to deal with it.  Use salty language.  Ugh.  Those balls are fucking clammy.  What? 
[01:07:00]  All right, Tony, we're gonna let you go.  Plane balls.  Oh, man.  Sorry, Tony.  You did good, though.  Bring back no filter.  Bring back no filter, Paul.  God, I haven't talked to Paul in a while.  I haven't a Paul.  I thought he died.  No.  Oh, he didn't?  What's up there, Paul?  All right, Tony, thanks, brother.  All right, have a good day, guys.  All right.  Take care.  Army Bob.  Nothing.  Punching out again.  All right.  Flaming wreck.  All right.  All right.  See you later, Bob.  Tempa Fidelis.  I have a feeling we're gonna hear from him a lot today. 
[01:07:30]  Let me say hi to Kevin in Jersey.  Kevin?  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you?  Hello.  We're kind of seeing what's going on in the phone world today.  What do you got?  I just think it's very funny, and justifiably so the way you guys rag on Snooki.  But if she walked in, I'd be really curious to see if you guys reacted the same way that  would be walked in.  I'd be nice to Snooki.  I don't like her or dislike her.  I don't really have an opinion on her.  I don't watch the show.  We actually changed how we look at things. 
[01:08:00]  Back in the old days, we used to attack people that didn't deserve it.  Now, we truly give everyone a chance.  And then if they're twats, like Paris Hilton, even Paris Hilton, we kind of back down a  little bit.  But in general, then if they're not giving us anything or they're just idiots, then we  go after them.  Here's the reason.  Because fucking Roland throws that whole thing at us where it's like, yeah, the publicist,  and if you can't be nice against the publicist, we won't get anything to it.  And I'm like, what are you even saying? 
[01:08:30]  I don't understand your words.  Almost all the A-listers are boring.  Yeah.  We're not ourselves completely.  Yeah.  Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman were nice guys.  They were good, yeah.  I wouldn't say they were great, but they were nice guys.  Yeah.  They were really nice.  Yeah.  It's a forgettable interview, but you know.  But that's most A-listers, I think, are like that.  Yeah.  Because they're very used to not giving out any real information.  Not very forthcoming.  No, I mean, and, uh. 
[01:09:00]  But they were cool.  We don't do that type of grilling interview show.  It's a hang.  It's a different vibe than a lot of fucking ugly shows.  We would absolutely give Snooki a shot.  If she, you know, was kind of twatty, then it would get ugly.  That's how we play things now.  Yeah.  I agree.  She was dull, Phil.  Anthony, Joe DeRozan most certainly wouldn't even hesitate on going after Jane Fonda.  Well, Joe likes older women.  Oh, women, excuse me.  That older women thing is just a little odd to me.  I think that really is a mother issue thing. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, it's creepy.  We'll, you know.  I'm no shrink.  I liked older women when I was in my 20s, but now that I'm as old as I am, older women  is like, that's dangerous to her.  I don't, uh.  You could fuck them to death.  Have a good day, guys.  Bye.  I'd fuck Jane Fonda.  That was a little too harsh for Kevin.  Yes.  He's out.  I'd fuck her in spite of the fact I don't like older women.  Yeah.  Yeah, because she's Jane Fonda.  She looks great.  I mean, her face looks good.  So you, though, with the fucking, has nothing to do. 
[01:10:00]  A firm handshake.  You, it has nothing to do with, uh, with if she's really hot or not.  It's just the name.  You'd stick your dick in someone because they're famous.  No, I never fucked a famous girl.  I mean, Brie Olsen's about as famous and, you know, it's.  Yeah, but I mean, Jane Fonda, you'd be, if Jane Fonda, I think, was walking down the  street, no makeup on, you wouldn't even fucking look at her.  If I knew she was 73 and she wanted to pop my dick in her mouth, I'd be like, go ahead.  Can I ask a Brie Olsen question? 
[01:10:30]  Sure.  Why did she blow us off and just do Howard last time she was in New York?  No idea.  What is that about?  I wasn't in town.  Did we do something wrong in her world?  Did anybody reach out to her?  I don't know.  Did anybody call her and say, hey, are you coming?  I don't know if anybody asked her.  She was in the building.  But I mean, did anybody ask for her to be on the show?  I don't know.  I don't know what happened there.  But then I know a lot of our listeners were tweeting her saying, why aren't you doing  O&A also?  And she never even wrote back or commented about it.  I have no idea.  So she absolutely knew we were looking for her. 
[01:11:00]  I called her.  I just tried to say something.  Yeah, I wonder if anybody.  Do you have no intel on that?  No, I was actually out of town when she was here.  I don't understand when that shit happens.  I don't know.  You know.  She called us first.  I mean, we talked to her on the phone before anybody did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ask Roland.  Did they reach out and did she say no?  Or did nobody reach out?  I don't know.  Well, we'll try to find out.  I would never have sex with Joan Rivers, Seth, in Illinois.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[01:11:30]  Jimmy?  No.  I would fucking.  I'd rather talk to her than fuck, though.  Yeah.  If I had to fuck a girl that talked to Joan Rivers, I would talk to Joan Rivers.  She's Joan Rivers.  Right.  All right.  Listen.  So my strange addiction.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you were here.  Remember the rock lady?  You know who was talking about her?  Joel McHale was talking about her.  I didn't let her.  Oh, he was?  Yeah.  I didn't catch a lot of the interview because I was talking to my psychotic manager in the 
[01:12:00]  dressing room.  But I looked up and Joel was like, and she eats rocks.  I'm like, it's funny.  He was talking about her.  It's one of the, yeah.  For his show, this is the clip of the week.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They talked about it.  It has to be.  Um, did you do a Joel McHale show while you were out there?  What show?  The Soup.  No, no.  Is it still called The Soup?  Yeah.  We have an open invite to do The Soup when we go to LA.  Oh, I don't know.  I honestly think he knew I was going to be there until he saw me.  They have those little, you know, walk-ons that they do.  Hey, how you doing? 
[01:12:30]  Oh, I would do that.  I even called him on.  I'm like, you're just saying that.  He goes, no, I'm serious.  Next time you're in LA, we'll get you on The Soup.  I'll have some soup or something.  Dude, that show's huge.  I would certainly do it.  I just didn't know it was an option.  All right.  Well, My Strange Addiction, the lady that ate rocks, um, we put some beeps in this one  and it came out very, very good.  Yes.  It could be the best one we've ever done.  As long as it doesn't sound dirty.  Yeah.  No, no, it doesn't.  I don't like the kids listening.  Yeah, we don't go for dirty, Jimmy.  It's very highbrow.  My name's Teresa.  I'm 44 years old. 
[01:13:00]  I live in Bedford, Virginia.  It's a pretty day today.  And I'm addicted to e-box.  I don't think I would be able to function every day if I didn't eat some quantity of  e-box.  Teresa has been addicted to e-box for more than 20 years.  She was initially attracted to the earthy smell.  I was just out walking one day.  I had no intention of e-ing it, but I did.  And once I did that, I was hooked on them. 
[01:13:30]  Now, Teresa can't go more than a few hours without eating e-box.  I actually like how it feels on my teeth.  I'm very worried about Teresa.  When your body can't handle what you're putting inside of it, it's going to rebel against you.  This is about the size I like it because it's not as hard to swallow.  I would normally take a f*** like this and normally just put it in my mouth.  And get the f***y taste off of it. 
[01:14:00]  I love that.  What taste.  We like that one.  What taste.  That does sound like cock.  I must say.  What's up, Roland?  You know we're on the air, right?  What's going on?  I got an answer from Roland, which I can't say on the air, but it makes sense.  It's not bad.  Oh.  Did we f*** up?  It ain't bad.  Are you a Dodgers fan?  What? 
[01:14:30]  Joe Dodgers blue.  Is that your favorite baseball team?  MLB sent it to me for free.  Who do you follow in baseball, Roland?  Whenever they send me free t-shirts, I'm a whore.  Roland likes whatever sports teams that a lot of celebrities like at the time.  He goes to games and makes some connections.  That's not true, Sam.  You're a fair weather fan.  Where were you when Lasorda first came on board?  Oh, God.  Where were you when they couldn't get any hits and Rod Carew was hitting in double plays? 
[01:15:00]  You're a fair weather fan.  Vince Colby.  Yeah.  Where were you when Brian Downing was trying to throw somebody out of second base and couldn't do it?  You're fair weather.  You know, I remember fucking watching Steve Garvey on Tattletales.  Oh, yeah.  I mentioned Angels.  What's Tattletales?  It was an old game show.  Yeah.  Where were you when Davey Lopes took his shit on the steps in the dugout? 
[01:15:30]  Where were you?  When Bert Hooten was late for the game.  Oh, Bert Hooten?  Yeah, I was naming California Angels before.  I forgot Brian Downing.  Where were you?  I'm Fernando Valenzuela.  Where were you when we watched the genius that was Oral Hirschheiser?  Right.  Kirk Gibson?  Bet you probably think it's O-R-A-L instead of O-R-E-L.  You're not a real fan.  You said Bert Hooten.  What about fucking the man that the surgery was named after, Tommy John? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  What about his sinker?  Fucking asshole.  Come on.  How did he know he was going to have Tommy John surgery?  I know.  That old guy.  That's hilarious.  He's like the first guy they did it on, so they named it after him.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  He had to have that Tommy John surgery.  Before that, it was just called retirement.  Yeah, that was pretty much it.  You're done with baseball.  That doctor should be a billionaire.  Fuckin' A.  Whoever came up with that.  Vinny Boombatz.  Yeah, we'll just twist this around.  Was it Vinny? 
[01:16:30]  My doctor.  Yeah, I tell you, I was in rough shape last week.  Couldn't pitch a game.  I was in rough shape last week.  Fuckin' best setups, punchlines ever.  It's great.  To the point.  I guess Sterling's Granderson call from last night, if we're talking baseball.  Oh, God.  I know we do this a lot, but supposedly it was really fuckin' douchey.  Douchey?  I think the whole country knows how douchey he is.  Oh, yeah, because it was trending on Twitter yesterday after the home run. 
[01:17:00]  Do we have it?  Oh, we should.  We'll go.  Grandy mankind.  The grand is something grandy.  Yes.  What does he say?  Here's what I want to hear.  Oh, Kurt Granderson.  The grand.  Oh, my left arm is numb.  My chest is tight.  The grand.  In the middle of, hey, hey, but I want his fuckin' left arm to numb up. 
[01:17:30]  Numb up.  Nittles high.  Nittles.  Yeah.  Somebody call 911.  Posada knew he tried to get him CPR.  The Grim Reaper's here.  We'll see you all soon.  We'll see you all soon.  We'll see you all soon.  It's fuckin' horrible.  Yeah, I guess I'll be talkin' to you again.  I guess there's no question now that Sterling's gonna be in the box. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, he's laying there at a six-foot.  He's going bye-bye in the box.  Of all the dramatic.  It's one of the greatest things ever.  Oh, it really is.  Her overdramatic, loud.  And she shuts the people up behind.  Like, stay with this.  She's like, I'm having a moment here that's gonna be one of those sports history moments.  She thought it was like the fuckin' Hindenburg crashing.  Yeah.  Years later.  It's like humanity. 
[01:18:30]  Could we, please?  Roger!  Roger Clemens is in George's box, and Roger Clemens is coming back.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things...  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen,  Roger Clemens standing right in George Steinbrenner's box,  announcing he is back.  Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee.  And there we go, John. 
[01:19:00]  You don't have to worry about who's gonna take that spot in the rotation.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Big grin on Jorge Posada's face.  Andy Pettit knew.  Big signs.  Roger Clemens is now a Yankee.  Attention, fans.  He is here.  And now we don't have to discuss who takes that place in the rotation.  In the rotation.  In the rotation.  She's losing her voice.  The madness in the Yankee dugout.  One guy is smiling.  The other guy knew. 
[01:19:30]  All the 19 guys doing.  My fuckin' sleeping.  My favorite part is where she goes off mic.  No, no, no.  Don't ruin my mind.  Yeah, yeah, hey, hey, hey.  What was she saying?  I'm gonna stay with this.  Come on.  Can we find out what Roger did after that announcement?  I think he went three and eight or something.  It was terrible.  It was terrible, and then he was gone.  And Clemens and his shitty speech, do we have that?  Oh, I'll see y'all real soon.  Yeah, I'll be seeing you soon.  Real soon.  That'd be funny if he was standing in Steinbrenner's box during the funeral. 
[01:20:00]  Of all the dramatic things, George is dead, his head on a satin pillow, and he's standing  in his box.  And here's Roger Clemens, standing on the edges of his trousers, got footprints on him.  We got to Roger Clemens.  Hit it.  Thank you all.  Well, they came and got me out of Texas, and I can tell you it's a privilege to be back.  I'll be talking to y'all soon. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, yeah, will ya?  Roger Clemens is in George's box, and Roger Clemens is coming back.  Goodness gracious.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Roger Clemens standing right in George Steinbrenner's box, announcing he is back.  Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee Dugout. 
[01:21:00]  You don't have to worry about who's going to take that spot in the rotation.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee Dugout.  Goodness gracious.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee Dugout.  A big grin on Jorge Posada's face.  Andy Pettit knew.  It's the greatest audio ever.  Roger Clemens is now a Yankee.  It really is.  I could listen to that on a loop for four hours.  And now we don't have to discuss who takes that place in the rotation.  In the rotation.  The whole time she's talking, fucking Sterling is trying to get a stool and a rope around  the rafter to hang himself.  What was his record when he came back with the Yankees? 
[01:21:30]  He finished the 2007 regular season with a record of 6-6 and a 4.18 ERA.  That's great.  Gary, you got me out of Texas.  I'm not sure Texas gave you up, stupid.  6-6.  I'll be talking to you real soon.  Wait, this guy's doing impressions.  Can you turn this up?  What do you mean?  He's doing impressions.  Affion Crockett.  Let's bring it all together.  Well, listen.  The president's been on this show quite a few times.  Oh, I know.  Let me ask you this, Mr. President.  He sounds like him.  Are you going to release a plan for a jobs situation in our country? 
[01:22:00]  Uh, look here, Gretchen.  I cannot confirm nor deny what my plans are for that release.  What about a vacation?  Do you like a vacation?  It falls apart after four words.  Uh, what I love is, uh, itsy-bitsy, teeny-winy, yellow, polka-bikinis on Michelle.  Wow!  Only on Michelle.  Well, he's a loving husband.  I'm a faithful man.  You're a loving husband.  That's it.  We can't wait to see you.  Has Saturday Night Live ever contacted you? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, yeah.  No, they haven't.  They didn't want me.  It's so exciting.  It's so exciting to have a new show on TV in the summer, because I don't like to watch  your pizza.  I watch your new show, and I've seen you before, and you're so funny.  Thank you so much, Peter.  So, you know, it's going to be good.  And it's physical comedy.  You know, I'm very, uh, Jerry Lewis-esque, Jim Carrey.  I love to be physical with my body.  Very Tracy Ullman.  I changed into a lot of characters, so.  And it makes it that much more real when you actually involve your whole physique in  the whole thing.  The executive producer on the show is Jamie Foxx. 
[01:23:00]  Newscaster.  So, it's going to be a good one, folks.  Check it out.  Sundays at 9 p.m. on Fox.  A.P. and Crockett.  Great to see you.  Thanks.  Break a leg.  Thank you much.  Coming up, he's one of the super committee picks.  Pennsylvania Senator Pat.  He actually said break a leg, this old white dude.  Oh, the Fox and Friends.  A3 and whatever.  That's your channel, Ant.  He's a big guy.  That's your channel.  That's it.  I love the Fox News.  That's my channel.  All right, we'll break and.  Donald Trump's picture.  What?  You're fired. 
[01:23:30]  With his stupid pursed lips.  Yeah.  I have class.  You're fired.  Shut up.  Fucking gaudy asshole.  It's Joe Rogan's 43rd birthday.  Happy birthday.  So, Iraq's got this for us.  As we go to break.  Oh.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Roger Clemens is in George's box. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Oh, my goodness gracious gracious.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line. 
[01:24:30]  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Trying to give a big F.U. to my ex-boyfriend for making me move to California and being miserable.  I faked it every time.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  They said he goes out to that trucker that called in and said he took a shower and got  back out to his truck and shit his pants.  Fuck you.  I know who you are.  Maybe if you didn't stuff your fat face like a starving hog on flop day, perhaps you'd be 
[01:25:00]  able to control your bowels a little better.  Fuck you.  And fuck you to me because I probably lost a friend.  Fuck you.  This is a fuck you to whoever just got into an accident on 95 South causing me to sit  in traffic.  You're all going the same fucking direction.  How do you get into an accident?  I hope you're fucking dead and I hope they put your name in the paper so I can personally  go and piss on your fucking grave.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give a big fuck you to the girl Jonna that I work with.  You're a fucking stupid twat.  You should get a new job as a tampon because you're a stuck-up cunt. 
[01:25:30]  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to give a big fuck you to every single driver in Miami.  You all suck.  You're all going to be the reason why I have a heart attack today because we've been going  five miles an hour for about fucking 30 minutes and I'm going to miss my goddamn appointment.  So thank you very much for being all cocksuckers and leading to me getting fired most likely.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I want to give a big fuck you to King DeLeon for canceling rest of that tour.  I have heat exhaustion and I can't make it. 
[01:26:00]  Fuck you, King DeLeon.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this fuck you goes to my ex-girlfriend.  Today would have marked the 16th anniversary of me being in the Air Force.  But because I got involved with your dumb ass and the shit you caused, I got booed.  And now I'm driving a fucking cab down in fucking Florida for tourists.  For more years, I could have had a full ride, full health care, benefits for the rest of  my life.  But because you stirred up shit, I don't get that.  Thanks.  Fuck you. 
[01:26:30]  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Hey, this is John Belvey.  Hey, this is Larry the Cable Dad.  Hey, folks.  This is Mark Maron.  Hey, this is comedian Nick DiPale.  What's up?  This is Joe Rogan.  You are listening to the Opie and Anthony Show, my favorite show in the history of the  fucking universe.  Well, thank you very much for that, Joe.  Happy birthday, Joseph.  Happy birthday.  You get to see him in Philly for UFC? 
[01:27:00]  We said hello.  Yeah, Joe always comes over and says hi.  I don't even think we talked about the UFC fights that much.  It was, he came over right, but we got there early because there was a Taylor Swift concert  next door, so we're like, we're going to get fucked.  But Joe comes over, he says hi.  We talked for a few minutes.  It was fucking great, dude.  The UFC was great.  I mean, the main fight, of course, was Rashad against Tito.  Rashad was just awesome.  Just an animal.  Yeah, he hadn't fought in well over a year. 
[01:27:30]  So now we're one step closer to Rashad Evans and Jon Jones going at it.  Yeah, Jones-Rampage.  Jones has to beat Rampage Jackson, and then it sets it up nice for a Rashad Evans-Jon  Jones fight.  And those two do not like each other.  Yeah, that'd be an interesting one to see.  I think I would pull for Rashad just because we've had him in and I liked him a lot.  Yeah, what if we have Jon Jones in?  We will, I'm sure.  But you know what?  Jon Jones kind of blew us off because he came out of nowhere and everyone wanted to talk  to him after that last fight he won, and he was in New York and he kind of didn't have  time for us. 
[01:28:00]  I'm not saying he blew us off, but Rashad Evans, yeah, I think we're Team Rashad right  now.  If we got Brock in, we'll get Jon Jones because he called us.  He did?  Jon Jones?  Oh, yeah.  He's the one who said he masturbates before the week of the fight.  Oh, yeah.  We like that guy.  Yeah, he was great.  We did have him on.  Yeah, yeah.  Just on the phone.  He wasn't available to come in, so we called.  Yeah, that's cool enough.  Shit, then who do we pick?  I think, I don't know, because Rashad and him train together and Rashad seems very comfortable  fighting him.  I don't know. 
[01:28:30]  I mean, Rashad's only lost once.  I think he's 20 and 1.  Jesus.  He lost to fucking, I think, Lahut and Mishida.  It was the only fight he lost, I believe.  He really likes us, too.  He had a good time.  Yeah, I told you, I saw him backstage, because Dana took me and Kenny and Kenny's son to  his private room, which I didn't think he was going to do.  And we're walking back to the press conference, and I said, Rashad was just there.  So I was like, hey, how are you, man?  And he put his arm around me.  He's like, oh, do you want to get choked out again? 
[01:29:00]  And then we just started chatting about the fight.  He was really a nice dude.  Very cool.  Really nice.  I'm going to have a montage of you getting beat up.  Yeah, I would still like to get it.  It's unfortunate I wasn't doing that when Forrest was here, or Rampage, or Chuck.  I just wish I was.  We got some big names, though, I'm working on now.  It should be up next week, probably.  Hopkins was very friendly.  I have no self-esteem.  Did Hopkins remember you?  Yes, he sat right in front of me.  I never think celebrities will remember me.  So I always open with him.  I'm like, you might not remember me.  I'm like, I don't know if you remember me, but I'm on the opening.  And he's like, what's the matter with you? 
[01:29:30]  I'll tell you what's the matter with you, Jimmy.  Because it happened to that fucking asshole at the Yankee thing.  Who was it?  Lyritz?  Yeah.  Oh, right, right.  We had Lyritz on.  Maybe he had other shit on his mind.  Yeah, but we had Lyritz on, and we had a great hour with the guy.  We really felt like we were bonding a little bit.  A little bit, as much as you do with a radio show, whatever.  And then a mere, what?  How long later?  A few days.  A few days, was it?  That's it? 
[01:30:00]  We were at this big Yankees thing that Eric Logan bought a table for, you know, the famous  Derek Jeter blowing off Jimmy.  Yes.  The whole night was a nightmare, because then we go up to Lyritz, and he's like, yeah,  yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, we just talked to you.  Yeah.  He appeared to have had a few.  Yeah.  He appeared to have had a few.  But he's like, really?  Pia raps.  Pia raps.  He was such a dick.  I was like, I don't know if you...  He really was a dick.  I said, like, I'm not sure if you remember me.  He goes, yeah, yeah, I remember you.  I was like, what a cock.  But Bernard was great.  But Bernard was cool. 
[01:30:30]  Hey, how's business?  He's asking me, hey, how's things going?  How's the show?  He chatted up.  He's like, yeah, I'm going to fight again, defend the title.  Nice.  I want to defend it five times.  He wants to come in when he's in New York.  Five times?  What is he doing?  He's just an animal.  But he was very, very pleasant.  Yeah.  Mickey O'Rourke was as well, although he smelled like a sub sandwich.  Really?  Yeah.  That's not good.  No, I didn't care.  Like, oily or...?  Mayonnaise-y?  Just like a sharp, sharp sub sandwich smell.  Oh, God.  Is his face really plastic-looking? 
[01:31:00]  It looks, yeah.  It looks awful, right?  I wouldn't say awful, no.  It's just...  It's Mickey.  I had heard he doesn't shower a whole lot.  But I don't care.  Why wouldn't you shower a whole lot?  He's Mickey O'Rourke, man.  He doesn't need to.  That's part of his thing.  He's Mickey O'Rourke.  I'm not saying for other people, for yourself, don't you feel like you have to shower every day?  You don't.  My fucking ball bag gets gamey.  Oh, my God.  Just for that alone, I would shower.  If I was Mickey O'Rourke, I wouldn't.  For my greasy hair and my gamey bag, I gotta shower every day. 
[01:31:30]  I wouldn't.  I would just be like, deal with it.  How many days could you go before your bag gets itchy and gamey?  Oh, my bag gets itchy and gamey by the next day, but a lot of times I'll go two days.  So how does Mickey O'Rourke take care of that?  I don't know.  I don't think to ask him.  But I didn't mind when my...  There's girls I've dated where I'd be like, don't shower for a few days.  I like that.  You're a weirdo.  Dude, it's fucking hot, man.  A little stenchy.  Fuck, yeah.  I don't mind it.  Now, two days, my girlfriend would be like, you like the way my ass smells today. 
[01:32:00]  I like girls enough to where that doesn't bother me.  Dude, the smell of an ass.  And I'm not talking about a filthy, dirty ass.  But you have to have chemistry, man.  You smell a girl that you don't have chemistry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  White girls.  No, but not all white girls.  Some of them are disgusting.  I don't care.  Look, man.  You take the deodorant and throw it out, sweetie.  Throw it out!  I had a little fun with one black girl.  And man, I'm sorry, but black girls smell.  What happened there?  They just smell.  Maybe it was just her. 
[01:32:30]  But you only had the one.  You can't condemn an entire race of people based on just one.  That's my reference point.  I don't know why the black guys don't go down on the black girls.  Get the fuck out of here.  There's some kind of a...  Is this really racist?  There's some kind...  Yeah.  Is it really?  Yeah, it probably is.  No, it's your opinion.  There's some kind of thing that says if there's one of something,  does not necessarily mean that there's any more.  That's fair.  But if there's two of something, it probably means there is more. 
[01:33:00]  So you only base it on one person.  So it doesn't necessarily mean there's more.  This broad stenched up my whole apartment.  Really?  No.  It was bad, though.  Here's what you're saying, Ant.  If one person calls you a duck, you might not be a duck.  Right.  If two people call you a duck, you might not be a duck.  But if three people call you a duck, start quackin'.  You ever been with an Indian broad?  I have.  Engine? 
[01:33:30]  One.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How'd that work out?  Dallas?  No.  South Jersey.  Indian broads are rough.  Really?  Their hair grows in front of your face.  Is it just right there?  Start growing?  It's...  That's a rough one, man.  Smells like Carrie.  Yeah?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's all hearsay shit.  Anyway.  Where are we?  Stick with the white. 
[01:34:00]  Oh!  Nice thing.  Have you ever gone off color?  Off color?  No, not really.  Never?  No.  No, no.  Never do some fooling around with some Asian broads?  No.  No.  I was never into Asian broads or anything like that.  Always white?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, there have been some tan white girls. 
[01:34:30]  Some white girls that have been, you know, Itralian.  Things like that.  Wow, man.  Some variety out there, man.  Maybe an occasional sand person that was, you know, in the snow.  Look, man, it was just my experience with this one woman of color, all right?  Yeah.  Don't fucking kill me on it.  I'm not condemning you.  Yeah, please.  I had a couple of the brothers over at my house yesterday. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, so you're tweeting pictures.  Yeah, I tweeted some pictures from across my room, out my window.  Yeah, I saw that.  Yeah, they were there to replace the light fixture in my pool.  Now, James was over a couple weekends ago.  Yes, I was.  And noticed, oh, goodness gracious, there's no lights inside your pool, you know, the little  spotlights in your pool.  And as it turned out, one of the lights had water in it and was tripping the breaker. 
[01:35:30]  Good thing, huh?  We could have all just barbecued.  Couldn't you be electrocuted from that?  Eh, probably.  Well, that's what all the safety things are in place for, the GFIs and the breakers and  everything like that.  So they came to fix it yesterday.  And after a couple of hours of milling around my backyard, they came to me and said, well,  I don't know.  You're getting power to the circuit breaker box and getting power to the junction box, but 
[01:36:00]  then something isn't going out to the light, so it might have shorted something out.  You got to call an electrician.  I'm like, yeah, thanks.  So, fail.  You call an electrician?  And then I was thinking, well, I'll have to keep doing it.  You think they were casing the joint?  If they were, they saw what I was wearing on my hip the whole time I was out back talking  to them.  Were you stretching a lot?  I didn't have to. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, okay.  Believe me, I didn't have to.  I had my shorts on and a t-shirt, and I went upstairs for one of the good guns.  Not the summer carry casual light .380.  What good one?  I was thinking it might, but I thought it might be a little too much to get the tactical  leg holster with the .50 cal in it.  Right.  So I just went with a nice .45.  One of the bigger ones, not the Wilson.  I went with the Colt.  Uh, 1911. 
[01:37:00]  Looks good.  It's cocked, locked.  You might as well be talking German.  I don't even know what you just said.  Well, not a Luger.  Ah, okay.  Luger?  Yeah, I know that.  Sure.  No, it's your standard issue military weapon of the past.  Nice.  Right up until, like, you know, the nom and the gold.  You're going to blow a hole in somebody?  A big hole.  Especially with gold dot hollow points.  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  Good.  But they were just, you know, look, I'm realistic. 
[01:37:30]  They're working guys.  They, you know, they're working guys.  I'm not having any trouble.  How the fuck is there water in the light in the pool that I've been going in?  I have no idea, but it was very distressing for me to hear because somebody, and it was  a white guy, put the, put the, change the light bulb, uh, uh, like a month ago, and  I think he fucked up.  Damn.  Yeah.  That's not cool.  How do you do that?  Someone's texting me now.  Um, I don't know.  How do you change a light bulb in a pool?  The light bulb has to want to change. 
[01:38:00]  Uh, oh, oh.  You never heard of that one?  The electric.  No, I'm sorry.  How many psychiatrists take to change a light bulb?  The light bulb has to want to change.  Only one with the light bulb has to want to change.  There's Keith.  See, uh, Rich, uh, the electrician, he's back next week.  I'll schedule a whole day of his services.  I need outlets put in.  I need some things fixed.  It's always, I've noticed when you buy a house, uh, the first couple of years, fine.  You know, you get your little things that you want to do to the house. 
[01:38:30]  And then after about five, six years, you just, there are things that constantly have  to be attended to and, and, and fixed and things.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Things just break down.  And when things break down, we break down.  It would make all our lives easier if shit didn't break down.  It just does.  I look up, I notice this ain't working.  Something else is out.  I turn on a light that doesn't work for some reason.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You ever have one light bulb out for six months? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  And you're like, why don't I just buy a light bulb?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  In my bathroom, I got one of those where it's a one, two, three, six light bulbs.  All on the top.  Then it went down to five that were on.  Oh, it's like, I can still see myself.  Swear to God, down to one.  I can still see.  Barely.  But I get, it's like the, it's the guest room, but I shower in there.  So I'm not waking people up in the morning, you know?  Yeah.  So, and we get, we have visitors all the time.  Like, it's going to fucking happen where the last light bulb goes out when they're here. 
[01:39:30]  When you turn on the switch and it goes, ping.  So I finally went back to three.  Yeah.  I didn't feel like getting all six.  Do you have your energy saver bulbs?  No.  They do last longer.  They were trying to sell me that shit.  I'm like, fuck that.  The only place I use those is in the living room because it's a real pain in the ass to  change those fucking light bulbs.  It's like 800 feet in the air.  I'm all about one guy can't make a difference.  So let everyone else do the energy saving shit.  I figure someone like me should be using a lot of power and then people in, you know, 
[01:40:00]  your standard lifestyle, they could cut back.  Yeah.  Let everyone else cut back.  Right.  One guy absolutely doesn't make a difference.  Well, you know, guys.  Sorry.  But it's not.  Well, you know, guys.  You want to hear Sterling's home run calls?  Oh, yes.  I don't, but I do.  And the right-handed deal swung on and drilled.  That deep right center field tore the gap.  And that ball is gone. 
[01:40:30]  It went over.  I think it may have hit the top of the wall and went over.  It is a three-run blast for Grandison.  Curtis, you're something sort of grandish.  The Grandy Man can.  Oh, the Grandy Man can.  He drills a three-run home run that skimmed the top of the bullpen wall and right center  and went in.  A three-run home run.  And the Yankees take an immediate three-nothing lead.  And for Curtis, his 30th home run of the season. 
[01:41:00]  And you've got another month and a half to go.  So, he's already got 30.  And that just pounced off the top of the wall and went into the bullpen.  Thank you, Lego wig.  She really does have horrid hair.  She really does look like that fucking, that weird thing that was in Scream 2 or Scream 3.  That weird puppet.  Remember the fuck that thing was?  No, I'm sorry.  Not Scream.  You're talking about Saw?  Saw.  Yeah, yeah.  She looks like the puppet in Saw.  The fucking puppet in Saw. 
[01:41:30]  With her rouged cheeks.  She's fucking horrendous.  He's terrible.  I'm telling you.  A good left arm numbing.  Oh, the Grandy Man can.  The Grandy Man can.  And Curtis, you're grand.  Something sort of grand-ish.  Or just a stroke.  He hit a second home run, guys.  Oh, well.  They can't do the same thing.  Now the right-hander deals.  There goes the deep right.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, what a shot.  Deep in the second deck right near the pole in right.  Curtis hits his second homer of the game.  Oh, Curtis.  You're something sort of grand-ish.  The Grandy Man can.  The Grandy Man can.  And he hits his second homer of the night.  And the Yankees take a 6-1 lead.  And, of course, now this is a career high.  His 31st home run of the season.  His career high.  And we've got a month and a half to go.  Say career high again. 
[01:42:30]  No.  And how much longer we have to go.  And he didn't commit to the Grandy Man can.  The Grandy Man can.  And then he's doing really well.  I bet you Hank Steinbrenner poked his head in.  The Grandy Man can make all of that.  He's fucking.  It's not.  Terrible.  He really is.  And it's a shame.  I hate Phil Mushnick.  But he bashed fucking Sterling in an article.  I enjoyed it.  Even though Mushnick is such a fucking crank.  His name fits him perfectly. 
[01:43:00]  He is a Mushnick.  You're a Mushnick.  What is he talking about today in the paper?  He's miserable.  Mushnick sounds like when you get dog shit caught in the treads of your sneakers.  And then you scrape it with your fingernail accidentally.  The residue under your nail should cause Mushnick Syndrome.  Most sports writers suck.  Most sports writers don't like sports anymore.  They're just fucking.  They're just jealous.  They're uncharismatic shitheads. 
[01:43:30]  And all they're doing is talking to men who fuck hot blondes.  And these fucking zeros.  Just sit there and write about what they would have did.  I would have brought in Bill Pabson.  Why didn't you bring in Bill Pabson in the seventh?  Bill Pabson.  Hey, can I have your paper?  I want to see what Phil Mushnick is.  I can't find him today.  Is he?  He's not in every day.  What is he in?  Daily News?  No, he's in the Post.  In the Post, that's right.  I do not see him.  He's always holier than thou with everything. 
[01:44:00]  Yet he's with one of the most scummiest of newspapers in the country.  I should have listened to someone on Twitter yesterday.  They gave us something way ahead of the media, and I didn't go with it.  Oh, shit.  But the Taliban who shot down that U.S. helicopter, those people are gone.  Yeah, so they say.  They fucking destroyed them.  I certainly hope that's true.  This hit Twitter a day or so ago, and I didn't believe the guy should have.  I retweeted that. 
[01:44:30]  Did you retweet it?  No.  Also, some commandos were saying that that whole operation was a bit of a clusterfuck,  and I had brought that up right from the start.  It seemed a little odd to put so many valuable assets in one of the most vulnerable of helicopters.  And then someone goes, no, the Chinook is well-armed.  It comes from this wing of the aviation unit.  And I was like, no, that wasn't the one they used.  They used a shitty fucking Chinook, and they put a shitload of valuable people in there and resources, 
[01:45:00]  and, like, all the eggs in one basket kind of thing, without any real support.  Chinook sounds like one of the words that Laverne and Shirley used when they were opening.  Shlemiel.  Chinook.  Maybe not.  Yeah, maybe.  I'm in the paper looking for Mushnick's column.  Yeah.  And I come across a picture of Tiger Woods.  The PGA tournament starts today.  Uh-huh. 
[01:45:30]  What the fuck?  Look closely.  Is that his helmet sticking through his pants, or is that a ball?  He's got a little fucking dinky bulge in his...  You see that, Jimmy?  No, I will not.  Go to page 68.  In your workbooks.  In your workbooks.  I just saw that photo, but I didn't notice.  Look at, look at...  That delicious black-button.  It's like a little...  What is that?  It looks like a little wiener head.  Like, he doesn't have much. 
[01:46:00]  That's what I'm wondering, because...  On the right side of his pants?  Yeah, if he's hanging to the right, that's his helmet.  I don't know.  The angle...  And then that looks like both his balls on the left side of the crease.  Oh, oh, I got it, yeah.  What is that?  Maybe it's something in his pocket.  No, that's not it.  Get the fuck out of here.  Hard to tell.  Maybe a T.  Huh?  Maybe it's his T.  Put his T in his pocket.  He pretty much could see the outline of his cake.  Is that it?  Anyway.  Go to Grandy Mansion!  I'm going to call this story of the day right here. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I'm going to do that.  Police nab alleged zit popper grossing out fast food customers.  Oh, yeah, this is fucking disgusting, man.  What the fuck is with this guy?  Why are the police getting involved?  Because he was disturbing the peace.  They wouldn't leave?  Yeah, and he had some kind of fucking needle on him.  Oh, he had a syringe in his pocket allegedly used to inject Oxycontin. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, I love that, huh?  What a creep, this guy is.  A man accused of disgusting McDonald's patrons by popping his pimples was under arrest after customer complaints led to a brief chase by the officers.  It started Monday when customers have alerted authorities to a man standing outside the restaurant for about 10 minutes squeezing away at the acne on his back.  Oh, God.  You're trying to eat?  And there's some guy just squeezing out some fucking pus out of his back. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, God damn it.  But he's outside the restaurant.  Events that followed with police ended in a brief chase and the arrest of the man who allegedly gave a false name when confronted about the complaint.  That is fucking disgusting.  The employees were running out with their burgers open and taking the residue onto the burger and then putting the fucking bun on top.  Making it taste better.  Back pus is the secret sauce.  That's why McDonald's is trying to cover this whole thing up.  Back zit pus.  That's disgusting. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, it is.  What's wrong with this guy?  What dexterity he has, though, to reach his back zits in front of a restaurant?  Mm-hmm.  You pop zits?  No, girlfriends always do.  Women love it because it hurts us.  They do.  You don't pop your own zits?  No.  I get right in there, man.  I don't have that many zits.  I like the ones where it comes out like a white string.  Yeah.  You ever have those?  There's one spot in my upper back where I've gotten a deep one, blackhead. 
[01:48:30]  I'll get like six or seven or eight on my cockshaft in a cluster under the head.  Oh, no.  Come on, now.  Wouldn't you hate it?  Did you ever see a photo of a wart cluster on a dick?  No.  What?  You never seen venereal wart clusters?  No.  Why would I?  Because they're in all the fucking magazines.  What magazines are you buying?  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, fuck.  Shit, I can't look at that.  Why do you guys always pop shit up on there that I can't look at? 
[01:49:00]  Let me see, Sam.  Which one are you looking at?  Oh, that's rough.  You might want that looked at.  I'm not looking.  No, look when they're under the crown.  Oh, God.  Under the crown.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that one there.  That's yucky.  Would you look at that?  Oh, I'm not looking.  It's a dick.  No.  It's a dick.  Even if it was in pristine shape.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[01:49:30]  Did that gross you out, Sam?  Yeah.  Love to see that rubbed on your eye.  I don't know.  It'd be fun to watch you pull away.  Mm-hmm.  What's it look like, the other one?  It looks almost like a delicious snack, but it's not.  I can't look.  What does that look like?  Like kind of onion bread.  Guys?  Yeah.  I might have to permanently ban Kevin from Connecticut.  Wow.  He just requested an Adam Sandler song.  Uh-oh.  I say you ban him.  What, Macarena?  Ew.  Does he do Macarena? 
[01:50:00]  Oh, hey, Masturbator.  Remember that?  Remember he was going to come in, if we were nice to the other people in the movie?  Oh, yeah.  Brooklyn Decker.  Get the fuck out.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Remember that?  I mean, Adam was going to probably come in, but then he did something else for serious  and figured he fulfilled his commitment.  Yeah.  That's good.  Could we play?  Thanks.  Because Kevin really wants the world to hear this.  It's called Zitli Van Zittles by Adam Sandler.  Is it?  You think it's good?  No.  I bet it stinks.  B-Rock, you got that? 
[01:50:30]  I think I do.  I think I know how it goes.  Zitli Van Zittles.  Okay, I got it.  You want to hear it?  No.  No.  How bad do you think this is going to be?  I'm going to say it's somewhere between the Macarena and clitoral circumcision.  Closer to the latter.  All right, here we go. 
[01:51:00]  Pause this.  If this sucks, I'm banning Kevin from everything.  Wow.  Go, ban him.  Everything.  Now, what's the criteria of suck?  What's the criteria?  Even Google Plus.  You just know it sucks?  We'll know.  We'll make the decision.  Okay.  We'll know.  It's very abstract.  Mm-hmm.  Go ahead.  Sounds real nice.  We need one laugh.  One laugh, that's it.  I had myself a girlfriend for almost two years. 
[01:51:30]  We had ourselves no secrets.  We had no fears.  There was nothing we wouldn't do when we were in the sack.  She'd even pop the set on my back.  Come on.  One night I was out of tea.  After I drank a few. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, God.  She called me red-handed and said we're through.  So bad.  Now she got a new boyfriend.  It nearly gave me a heart attack.  You look like assholes right now, man.  You look like assholes right now, man.  Oh, my back.  How long exactly?  Asshole.  Would you kindly shut your noise hole?  You're in the same place.  You're a phony.  I can't reach it with my left or right hand.  I wish it was on my face. 
[01:52:30]  Goodness gracious.  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  I'm going to trade it for a squeeze.  Won't somebody pop it for me, please?  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  There's a girl in this lonely world, and you're looking.  Oh, da-da-da-da-da.  You suck!  I promise.  That's no lie.  Ugh.  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucks ass.  The thing I'll ask of you, a good would name our first child, Zack. 
[01:53:00]  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Pop is it, I'm all back up.  I'm dying here.  Oh, people are here.  Oh, pop a little bit of an extra year.  Well, I'm sitting alone by the phone, and no one seems to call.  I try to scrape my shit off.  We're tanks for nothing!  There it is. 
[01:53:30]  It's not making me laugh, but I don't hate it like I thought I would.  Yeah, because you made it sound like a real song.  Yeah, it's just kind of there.  Sailor sucks.  Someone's got to say it.  He sucks.  This is terrible.  He really fucking sucks.  Yeah, this is terrible.  God!  He's a billionaire, for Christ's sake.  Fuck.  Why? 
[01:54:00]  What's the verdict?  Banned from everything?  Bye-bye, Kevin.  Kevin from Connecticut crying quietly.  That's Nate Sacked.  It's like, sometimes when you're younger, you make up songs like, letter one line, just  to annoy your friend.  Yeah.  Did you do that, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I talked to my friend the other day, who I've known since I was a teenager.  And we used to drink together, and we got sober together. 
[01:54:30]  Wow.  Is he still sober?  Yes.  Nice.  And he reminded me of a little one-line song I would sing when I was saying goodbye, and  then we would talk tomorrow just to annoy him.  And he remembers it.  It's 22 years later.  Wow.  Just bugged him.  Man, that really must have sucked.  It just stayed.  It would really annoy him.  Sunk right in there.  Sunk right in there.  Didn't go away.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Don't ask, Cat.  No.  Don't do it, Ed.  He's just waiting, because he needs someone to ask.  And all we have to do is not ask, and this ends anything.  It's like a vampire.  Don't do it.  You mean like...  Don't do it.  No, I was saying, like, if someone would go to him, like, what was the song?  Well, if somebody said that, I would say...  Yeah.  This is when I was, like, 19 or 20. 
[01:55:30]  Uh-huh.  That I would just annoy my friend by saying, uh, you can do what you want to do.  Just call me tomorrow, chap.  Down goes Frazier!  Down goes Frazier!  Down goes Frazier!  Wow.  And that's what...  That was it?  It's the whole thing.  He said it would just...  Without a loop in his head. 
[01:56:00]  I don't know why I even said it to him.  Fucking ruling.  Why chap?  I don't know.  He's black, too.  That's what's so weird.  You can do what you want to do.  Just call me tomorrow, chap.  And he hated it.  Oh, because if that's stuck in your head, you want to kill.  Yeah.  You want to kill.  I think chap is what did it, but it is kind of lyrical.  I fucking forgot. 
[01:56:30]  Wow.  I forgot all about that.  That's terrible, isn't it?  You asked.  Indirectly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I couldn't help.  Learn the secret today.  No, I fall right into it.  I'm an addict when it comes to...  Learn the secret.  I'm a Jimmy Norton addict.  He sets things up and he's just waiting for someone to ask more questions.  We don't have to ask the questions.  Yeah.  And then he just sits there eagerly waiting.  That's a bad one, though.  Yeah, it is.  That's fucking awful.  That's not good.  Yep. 
[01:57:00]  I don't remember how it originated.  Hey, I got Travis in here.  Travis, who wins the PGA this year?  I don't know.  It didn't happen yet.  Well, who do you think...  Who are you going for?  Rory.  You can't have the same guy I want.  Sure I can.  Then we can talk about it together.  Yeah, I'm off Team Tiger.  I was a Team Tiger guy for a long fucking time.  I don't even think he's going to qualify.  No.  I'm on Team Tiger.  I like Dustin Johnson.  I'm going...  Why is he Dustin?  I'm going DJ. 
[01:57:30]  And who you got?  Your Johnson needs a Dustin.  Who you got, Ant?  What?  I know you don't...  I have Phil Mickelson.  I'll always root for Phil, too.  Oh, really?  I got Phil Mickelson.  Phil's had a very shitty year.  Well, he's got that arthritis thing that he talks about on the commercials.  Yeah.  Only won one tournament this year.  Do you want to watch...  Or do you want to ask Golf Shirt Eric in there who he wants?  Oh.  Yeah, E?  What do you got for the PGA?  I'll go with Rory.  Why would you do that? 
[01:58:00]  Because Shane McMahon reps him.  Does he really?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, if you saw the last tournament, Shane went standing right next to his father.  I saw he was standing there.  I didn't know he repped him.  Yeah, that company he works for reps him, and Shane handled him.  Oh.  I actually have a pick for the PGA this year.  Oh.  Oh.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, it's not a bad one.  That's good.  It's good you have a pick.  I have an idea.  Yeah, I don't know whether or not it's possible.  Yeah.  See it?  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  And you'll leave it at that.  Right.  Look at him, though.  He's just waiting.  He can't do it himself.  He needs someone to go, oh, yeah.  It's like a vampire coming into a house.  He has to be invited in.  He needs someone to just say, oh, yeah?  Who do you got?  I'm not big on the Godfathers you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Once in a while, I'll make a pick.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Got anyone this time?  No.  Why would you do that?  I do, actually.  We had him that time.  Oh. 
[01:59:00]  Oh.  Jeff Tetley.  See, I forgot.  Bill's brother.  Why'd you forget?  I just told you.  Yeah, but I thought he was just really wanted to join in.  I finally figured him out.  Let's.  And say who.  Oh.  The bad name is Jeff Tetley.  That's an awful name.  Yeah, I thought he just wanted to get into the whole thing because we were trying to figure it out.  Did you?  I thought he wanted to get in there.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Adam Scott would be a good story, but he's not going to win two tournaments in a row. 
[01:59:30]  I just want Tiger because I like him.  I really do.  We got Jimmy back for a second here?  Oh, yeah.  I like Tiger.  Are you tired, Jimmy?  I'm very tired, but I like Tiger Woods the best.  He's not.  He doesn't have a chance.  Probably not, but I still love him.  Isn't that so weird to say these days?  He doesn't have a chance.  Yeah.  That ruined his life.  I'm telling you, his headspace is so fucked up because that was his release.  He's an addict, and he would probably play with that humming, that in the back, knowing 
[02:00:00]  what he's going to do.  I write better on planes when I can access the internet.  It's really weird.  When I have a distraction, I can write better.  When I write for real and I'm home, a lot of times I'll jerk off while I'm writing.  I'm playing chess with friends.  I'm telling you people who I play with, I make a lot of bad moves.  While I'm playing chess, I am a lot of times jerking off watching porn, and I'll just take  my hand off my dick, and I'll open the chess thing and make a move, and then go back to 
[02:00:30]  jerking off, and I'll stop it.  Hasbrov do that?  Yes.  Except he was tugging on someone else's king.  But I mean, literally, it's a weird balance thing, and then I'll stop it, and I'll watch  a little bit of The Sopranos that I'm going through again.  And then I was reading Ben Mesrich's book.  Jesus, he's multitasking with shit.  It's a really weird way to keep myself occupied.  And I think for him, that was a weird thing he would do, not while he was playing, but  a part of his whole fucking routine was traveling, seeing the girl in this one, the little secret 
[02:01:00]  text message in the pocket, walking in between holes, all this stuff that was the big secret,  and now it's out, and it wrecked his whole vibe.  So, why hasn't anyone else talked about that?  I don't know.  Because you know addiction, obviously, so why, no one's talking, I guess they can't.  It's not a sexy enough story.  But basically, you're saying that Tiger could only win if he's acting out on his addiction. 
[02:01:30]  Or I think, no, well, no, I think mentally getting caught like that just blew him.  I think he feels so naked and exposed everywhere, he doesn't feel invincible anymore.  Yeah.  And now he can't really just bang girls.  Do you think he's banging girls right now?  He's probably seeing somebody, but it's so, he's probably so afraid of being public, he  can't do the dirty texting.  He can't do any of the shit he used to do.  And he really liked doing all that, right, Jimmy?  I think he would have.  I mean, he obviously did some texting.  I just think that that whole thing...  You think that calmed down his head enough where he could focus on his golf? 
[02:02:00]  Or it was just a part of it.  It was something like...  It went hand in hand?  Yeah, it was just what he did.  It was just, it was probably like, if he had gotten away from the addiction in a healthy  way, it probably would have been better for him.  But the fact that he was exposed, like, and he's such a private dude, the fact that he was  exposed like that, and he's naked, and everybody knows.  Right.  Everybody knows what he said about fucking on Ambien, and they all know his dirty secret,  how he humiliated his wife. 
[02:02:30]  It's like, this was a private guy, man.  You know what I mean?  I think that killed him.  Right.  He'll never recover from that.  Mm.  Yeah, I think you're on that.  I think you're right on it.  It's like, how do you...  Because your whole fucking...  Your whole personality, your whole thing is blown up.  It'd be almost like...  I can't even think of an equivalent for me, because I talk about everything, but it would  be almost like if I had stolen all my material from some guy, some comedian, say, in fucking  the Midwest or Florida who was a nobody, and then all of a sudden he got on a YouTube show. 
[02:03:00]  It was kind of like what Rogan did to Mancia, and all of a sudden all this stuff was out.  I would be so fucked up over every club I went into, I would think they know.  They know.  And even when I was writing my own stuff, I would think they'd think I'm stealing.  It just...  It fucking...  It trips you, man.  I don't know if you can get back up from that.  Sorry, I'm babbling.  No, I find it fascinating, because no one has really looked at it that way before.  I don't know why.  They talk about how maybe he's injured, or maybe it's because he's not on the steroids 
[02:03:30]  or growth hormones anymore, or he changed his swing.  Everyone has an excuse why Tiger's not winning.  But the fact is, this guy hasn't won a major in how many years, Travis?  Are we looking at three years at this point?  He's been bad.  Two years?  November of 2009.  Yeah, it's almost two.  Almost two years.  November of 2009, when he got in trouble, he has been horrible, because his whole life  was splayed out in the tabloids, and he had been untouchable until then.  Right, right.  It was untouchable.  They were basically saying, yeah, of course he's going to break all the records. 
[02:04:00]  Now it's like, he's going to be lucky to win a couple more majors for the rest of his  career at this point.  Unless he finds some kind of peace with what happened, then he...  Huh?  Oh, right on.  Who's teeing off?  Oh, is he playing now?  If he fucking finds some kind of peace with it, then he might just start winning again,  because I think he's probably the most talented guy out there.  By the way, TV is so fucking done.  I'm starting to watch, especially the golf tournaments and stuff.  They give you four or five choices of what you want to check out.  Great quality, too. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, unbelievable quality.  They don't need all that shit around the screen, but still.  Like, when you do the Masters, you can hang out at a few holes and just watch everyone  going through.  You can watch the TV coverage.  They give you options, man.  Thank you.  Where are they?  And how is TV going to compete with that, Ant?  I guess the computer just has to kind of integrate with the TV.  Integrate into the TV, which they're doing, you know?  But the quality on your computer screen now, man, you can watch this all day.  Yeah, it's like a regular TV quality.  Watch to finish in that top 125 and get into the playoffs. 
[02:05:00]  You mentioned that.  I love golf.  I don't know.  I think it's awful, but I like Tiger so much.  I don't know if our audience digs golf.  Probably not.  The majority, anyway, you know, but I love it.  But even, you know what, Tiger?  I love just sitting around and watching fucking golf on the weekends.  Unless there's stuff with a caddy that I just don't get, because I don't know  that relationship, but it seems like even he is fucking not looking at what  the real problem is.  Like, he dumped his caddy.  He's trying to find out what's all, unless there's stuff I just don't see. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, we don't know what went on between those two, but I'm just amazed he  would let Steve Williams go.  And the guy he picked, Travis, you know, right?  He's his childhood friend.  He looks like a geek.  He has ridiculously white legs that they make fun of.  But he's also been part of the controversy with Tiger, right?  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  Oh, some kind of steroid thing?  Well, they're hinting with steroid issues with Tiger, and this guy might have, I  don't know.  I don't know the exact...  Goatee Tiger.  Huh?  Goatee Tiger.  They're staggering the... 
[02:06:00]  Tiger going to the T right now.  No, I mean, he's got his goatee.  Oh, yeah, it's the evil...  And we said this would happen.  Evil Tiger.  We said he should grow a goatee, if you remember.  Yeah, it's like when Kirk and Spock went into the alternate universe, and Spock had a  goatee, and he was evil.  Well, let's watch the tee, him tee off.  I'll see him shank it.  Davis dominating that 97 championship.  What's he doing?  Is he teeing off?  Yeah, this is the start of the PGA.  Davis Love III.  I hate that fucking Wasp name. 
[02:06:30]  Davis Love III.  Davis Love III.  That fucking rich cocksucker name.  No.  Hold up the quiet signs.  Quiet, everyone.  Quiet.  Yeah, look at the guy.  He's got his arm.  Hush, hush, hush.  Davis Love.  Privileged boy is hitting the ball.  Hush, hush, hush, hush.  It's a boy of privilege is hitting the ball.  Fucking assholes.  Okay.  And there's the swing.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Right up the middle.  Down the middle.  That's nice.  By the way, when you talk about the right there. 
[02:07:00]  Let me go for the tee right away.  That means it's down the middle.  It's on the fairway.  A little to the right.  On the fedway.  A little to the right.  They know that the eyes are going to be on them today.  It's good.  Fucking great place for machine gunning.  Tiger Woods getting quite an ovation from this crowd here.  Still 190th on the PGA Tour this year.  Wow.  190th.  Driving accuracy.  Let's see if Tiger can pull things together.  Have some concentration. 
[02:07:30]  Let's have some quiet here.  Pussy!  Tits!  Shoes.  Running shoes.  The fucking crickets.  Oh.  That had a hurt.  Three wood to play.  Three wood.  The first two players here in our marquee.  He really belted that motherfucker.  That one.  Oh.  Goodness gracious.  One on the right side.  One in the left side.  He's on the fairway.  All right.  Is that a good shot?  How many feet did he hit that?  Scott of Florida.  How many feet?  That was about 80 feet. 
[02:08:00]  Oh.  See.  I would have thought farther.  Scott of Florida.  What's going on?  Your ass.  Hey, how you doing, buddy?  All right, bro.  About 80 feet.  Hey, I was going to let you know, the guy that's caddying for Tiger now was supposedly  the middleman between him and a lot of the women when he got in trouble.  Oh, yeah.  So he brought him back in.  And the reason he let Stevie go was he got upset when Stevie wanted to caddy for Adam Scott.  He asked to do it once, and Tiger said, yeah, you can.  And then he did it again, and that's when Tiger let him go. 
[02:08:30]  I've also heard rumors that Steve Williams' wife is still friends with Tiger's ex.  Ah.  Right into the people.  I love that shot.  Who was that?  Harrington.  Harrington.  Oh, there's three guys in the group?  Harrington.  I just think, yeah, there's two guys in the marquee group.  Thank you.  I was trying to figure out all that shit.  Look at these two.  How's Davis Love the Third doing?  Davis Love the Third.  Lovey.  It sounds like a made-up name. 
[02:09:00]  Davis Love the Third.  There's two other Davis Loves?  I'm the third in line of the Davis Loves.  Ugh.  Yes.  Fucking yuck.  Of the Connecticut Loves.  Pull clips from Tiger's press conference yesterday.  He is plain bitter.  That's Volk2845 on Twitter.  And how many stops fucking pretending to, like, just be the guy you are?  Enough already.  The fucking lid has been blown off.  Stop trying to fucking stuff the water back in the jar. 
[02:09:30]  Just realize it's been spilled and fucking just, that's it.  Be your whorish self.  It's almost like.  Be a playboy now.  Be a playboy now.  Fuck it.  Just do it.  Bang a bunch of chicks in the shitter.  Right.  You fucking dumb exes out doing what she's doing.  Let's go to Adam.  Adam's got some fucking info on something.  Hey, Adam.  Hello.  Hey, Jimmy.  That's a great call. 
[02:10:00]  You know what?  When that guy, you know, is an addict, you know, once you lost that control factor of  anything you wanted to do, everybody's telling him every day how fucking great he was.  He could do whatever he wanted, you know, lining up porn stars.  Well, and if you want, I guess Perkins girls.  But, you know, he lost that confidence.  And then when you lose confidence in golf, the first thing that kills him is his putter.  If he can't punch, you know, back in the day, Tiger lined up 20 footers and just drain  him.  Yeah.  If he knew he could do it. 
[02:10:30]  You know, he had that King Kong dick attitude.  Right.  So, Jimmy, you nailed it right on the head.  Yeah, I think that's a big part of it.  Hey, Adam, did I nail any of this stuff, too?  Nothing.  Nothing.  You know what?  I started with you guys about three months ago, and I love the fact you guys are talking  about golf, because I'm a golf dork.  If we talked about golf a little too much, whoa, boy, will we be fired.  Yeah.  Hey, CNN is showing Tiger tee off.  We already saw that.  Yeah, we saw that. 
[02:11:00]  See it on the intranets.  In the intertubes.  Intertubes.  Thanks, Adam.  Hey, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks.  He's still the only really interesting guy in that whole sport.  No, that's not true, Jimmy.  Do you think?  Really?  Most people don't care about any of them.  That's not true anymore.  That would have been true about who?  Maybe two years ago.  There's a lot of young guys coming up now that's really making it exciting again.  But I don't hear who they are.  Well, I guess you've got to be a fan of the sport, but this Rory McIlroy is unbelievable.  McIlroy.  This Justin Johnson is a lot of fun to watch. 
[02:11:30]  Adam Scott, who's 31, 32.  How old is Tiger?  Coming into his own.  35?  Tiger is, I would guess, 38.  Three or four, probably, if I had to guess.  He still has plenty of time left.  I don't know about that.  No?  I don't know about that.  I just hate the fucking whole golf mentality with their fucking tucked in gentleman shirts.  And Davis loves the third.  Well, he doesn't like Davis loves the third. 
[02:12:00]  And who's the one that chokes every year?  Phil.  Oh, I fucking hate Phil Mickelson.  I love that he just can't get it done.  Can't close the deal.  Every tournament, there's a lot of people that love Phil Mickelson.  I mean, a lot.  He's the go-to guy because he's so nice.  And after his round, he signs autographs forever and blah, blah, blah.  But every tournament, it's guaranteed he's going to miss a two-and-a-half-foot putt.  Yeah.  Every fucking tournament. 
[02:12:30]  It drives the Mickelson fans nuts.  It's like, will you just concentrate, Chubby?  I hate him.  Tiger's second shot.  Tiger's second shot.  All right.  Tiger's second down.  Turn that sound, please.  Par four.  Here on the left side of the fairway.  Tiger with the fairway.  Might look good.  That one.  Yeah, he fucking...  All right.  15 feet to the right.  Par four.  He's got a birdie shot. 
[02:13:00]  Here's your Davis Love III.  Davis Love III.  Exactly.  With his fucking faggot white pants and his white hat.  His second shot.  Oh, I hate him.  I hope he collapses.  He's located just eight steps on the green on that left side.  Let's see.  This one.  Oh, rolling back now.  Rolling back toward the pin.  Nice shot.  Nice shot there.  He's got about a 10-footer.  He's got about 10 feet going slightly down for a birdie. 
[02:13:30]  I was hoping it rolled into a fucking yellow jacket nest.  We had to whack it out with some fucking bullet ants.  It's always better to miss to the opposite side.  A puddle of AIDS from TedWilliamsHead.com.  Great sports blog.  It says Tiger's 35 years old.  The 35-year-old Tiger Woods.  Second shot landing on the green.  These guys should be forced to fucking wear those ant gloves and fucking do their putts.  Play with the ant gloves on where they...  Like those fucking, yeah, the tribal ant gloves. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, the ants are inside the gloves, pinching your hands.  Yeah, blackening them with fucking poison.  Here, hit this, dickhead.  We got golf fans.  Carlin wants to give you some Davis Love info.  Oh, good.  Carlin.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hi.  I like your name a lot.  Thank you.  Hey, Davis Love the Third has a son, and they call him Drew for Davis Love Quadrupled.  Wait.  Davis...  Drew? 
[02:14:30]  It doesn't make sense.  Drew is quadrupled.  Oh, cute fucking...  What?  Drew D...  Because he's quadrupled.  Oh, Drew.  Oh.  Instead of calling him quad or pole.  Is his name Davis Love the Fourth?  Yes.  Oh, fucking asshole family.  Let the name go.  They love that name, huh?  Yeah, the Fourth.  Let me tell you something about letting the name go.  All right, thank you.  Let me tell you something about letting the name go.  You're looking at a guy that was supposed to be named Frederick Wilfred Hughes III. 
[02:15:00]  That would work.  My dad wanted that name.  My mom said, fuck no.  She was right.  And she dropped the fucking name that was in my family for a while.  My name's Fred.  I'm a man.  I was supposed to be Frederick.  Frederick.  Frederick.  Wow.  Frederick Hughes and Anthony Cumia with you.  That is something.  Yeah.  Frederick.  Fred and Anthony just doesn't sound the same.  Frederick. 
[02:15:30]  No.  Do I look like a Fred?  No.  You don't.  Look at how disgusting.  Frederick.  Davis Love.  Hi, I'm Fred.  Yeah.  The Third.  Frederick and Anthony here.  I worked for my dad.  I called you Freddy.  My dad looked like a Fred.  I don't look like a Fred.  No.  Frederick.  Davis Love looks like a Davis Love.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah.  Very privileged.  Is this him?  Yep.  Cut in both the Masters and the Open Championship time for 45th. 
[02:16:00]  Who's this dork?  He's played a lot this year.  You want more Davis Love info?  Yes.  While he lines up the putt?  Sure.  All right.  That's not Davis Love.  California, Bill?  Hello, Bill.  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  I just want to hear your reaction.  Hey, Davis Love.  That was my reaction.  He's going to a tournament, and his father was going to a tournament on a private jet,  and it crashed on the way to the tournament.  And then a few years after that was when he won the PGA. 
[02:16:30]  And when he won the tournament, there was a rainbow in the background, and they thought  that was his father sending a message.  Of course.  Well, all right, look.  You know, I feel bad the guy lost his father in a plane wreck, but to think that your father's  a leprechaun all of a sudden is a little unrealistic.  He's not a magic creature with a pot of gold.  You almost got a spit take from me.  A leprechaun.  I was so close.  What do you think he is?  Right?  Why all of a sudden do you think that his father turned into a fucking light refraction when 
[02:17:00]  water falls?  That's so weird.  You know, my father was in that plane, and now I think he's pond scum.  It was so stupid.  It wasn't your father in the rainbow.  Well, when you find change on the street, it's all.  Oh, Joe, why would you do that?  I don't know why I'd even say that.  That's going to set him off.  Why do you say that?  Set who off?  I'm not going to say.  I don't know.  I'm not going to say.  Fez?  That's the right answer.  What do you find change on the street mean?  But for some reason, it always comes back to me. 
[02:17:30]  I get the blame.  Anthony started.  What does that mean?  You haven't heard that one?  No.  See, when Fez...  Yeah, well, people do certain things to cope with adversity in their life, and losing  a father is an adversity in your life.  I know this, of course.  It's a big one.  And Fez thinks that when he sees change on the sidewalk or the street and picks it up,  it's sort of like a sign and a little gift from his father. 
[02:18:00]  Couldn't change there for him.  Couldn't his father put change in a cleaner place than the fucking streets?  I hope my dad doesn't leave money in the streets.  Tiger Woods for Birdie.  My dad had no money to leave.  Tiger Woods for the Birdie.  Birdie Eagle.  My dad died broke.  Here we go.  He's lining this up.  Hope he gets a mulligan.  Concentration.  Here's Tiger.  And there it is.  Oh, shit.  Tiger Woods for Birdie.  Tiger starts the PGA Championship with a Birdie. 
[02:18:30]  That, uh, wow, what a great shot.  Just an all-around good first hole there for Tiger Woods.  Hopefully his concentration's back.  He can keep this up.  Starts with a bang.  And we start seeing the Tiger Woods of old.  Maybe he's getting used to this new caddy.  The caddy he got from the Geek Squad.  Yes, the Geek Squad caddy from Best Buy.  Hey, Anthony, Jimmy.  Yes, yes.  It's all about Davis Love right now.  Scott Mac Sween on Twitter writes, 
[02:19:00]  Check out the video of Davis Love.  This is for you, Sam.  Losing it on a spectator for saying no love.  Ew.  Oh, well.  Nothing like a tough golfer.  Supposedly he really went after this guy.  You'll hopefully find it on YouTube.  Uh, Scott, next time, why don't you give me a fucking link?  Yeah, you prick.  Yeah, Scott, you no-link sending bag of shit.  I banned you because you didn't send me a link.  That's a blockaroo right there.  Absolutely.  You know, Sam, uh, Sam is very talented in many different aspects.  He stinks on fucking Google. 
[02:19:30]  But when it comes to Googling, he just can't put it together.  Go to YouTube.  And don't spell tough, T-U-F-F, you fucking idiot.  We're not doing tough.  Yeah.  Oh, tough golfer.  You just put Davis Love flips out.  Yeah, that means the guy had to write flips out in his, uh...  Yeah.  Are you just going to write Davis Love?  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, all those golf shots.  Davis Love angry.  Yells, scolds.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Reads the riot act, the third degree.  Davis Love fan.  Yeah, that's going to help.  Gives the business.  First guy who tweets me how we find this fucking thing.  We'll get some nice credit.  Davis Love attacks fan.  Yeah.  Well, you're finding wedding photos.  How about something else?  God.  But if you didn't come up with fan...  Your Googling is heinous.  Oh, my God.  You want more info?  Yes.  Kevin from Connecticut.  This is going to...  I thought he was banned.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:20:30]  Oh.  Oh, boy.  That didn't work out too well, did it?  Oh, boy.  See, I'm not the blocking kid like everyone thinks.  All right, what's his...  What's his information?  I rarely block.  Kid is a fact.  His middle name is Milton.  Davis.  Oh, Milton.  How do you not just hate his guts?  Yes, Milton.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Fucking...  I'm trying to get someone on Twitter to help me out.  Enough with the golf.  Fuck you. 
[02:21:00]  Block.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Todd.  Hi, Todd.  Hello, Fred and Tony in the morning.  How are you?  Hey.  What's up?  What up, Todd?  The previous caller stole a little bit of my thunder.  Take care, Todd.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy in South Carolina.  You really?  That's funny.  You told me.  You said take care. 
[02:21:30]  That's all I need to hear.  Jimmy, what do you got, buddy?  Oh, yeah.  Davis Love has a famous sister, Courtney Love.  Oh, fuck it.  Did you know that?  Yeah, from yesterday.  I remember these.  A lot of these came up.  Holy shit.  Courtney Love's related to Davis Love.  Yeah.  Are they cousins?  No.  Sister.  It's not a sister.  Yeah, it is.  Every family has the wild one.  She's the wild one.  I don't believe that.  Why wouldn't you believe that?  Because I just never heard it before, and I would have heard it before. 
[02:22:00]  Maybe because the connection is actually whole.  You want to bet?  She's in hole, and he plays golf.  Want to put your money where your mouth is?  I'll bet you a kiss right in the fucking dick helmet.  Well, how about we move on?  All right.  I'll bet you the winner has to suck Bobo's Peter.  We got George III, who wants to name his kid George IV.  Should we tell him no?  But if someone dies, don't you drop the number down, Ant?  I think so, yeah.  How about you just fucking don't do it? 
[02:22:30]  So shouldn't Davis Love be Davis Love II at this point?  Davis Love II.  Or he might just be Davis Love.  Yeah.  Maybe if the grandfather's gone, too, then he's just Davis Love.  Yeah, they should knock the numbers off when they start dropping dead.  No, I'm serious.  I think that's how it works.  Hmm.  I don't know.  We're stuck until we get this Davis Love video, Sam.  Well, how come nobody else has found it?  Huh?  Because you're the one at the computer.  Yeah, that's right.  Let me see. 
[02:23:00]  A lot of happy birthdays of Joe Rogan on my Twitter.  Yeah.  How about for me?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy, your birthday was a month ago.  All right.  I think I might have to give somebody credit.  Let me see if I got it.  Got to give them credit.  A guy I follow.  Oh, yeah.  I got it.  What's it called?  It's called Davis Love Heckler.  And hold on.  Ah.  Hale Cumia gets the plug.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I know him.  I follow him.  H-E-I-L. 
[02:23:30]  C-U-M-I-A.  He's a good one to follow.  I follow him.  I think.  Or does he follow me?  No.  I don't know.  I know who he is, though.  Mop.  Mop.  You got it?  All right.  Here it is.  What are you going to play to me?  So our marquee group on.  Why don't you stop, Sam?  What are you doing on the computer?  You had three things playing at the same time.  None of them right.  There's two things.  Both were right.  What are you going to say to me?  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  I'm saying it.  I wouldn't say that.  We're not leaving here until somebody tells us who it was. 
[02:24:00]  It's about the fourth to fifth time.  There's a gentleman right here.  Okay.  I understand.  Great.  That's all it was?  Fantastic.  So Davis Love III is all pissed because someone said no love or whatever.  So then he's like, I'm not leaving until I find out who said it?  And then some cunt told it.  Gentleman right here said it.  So then why is the video?  Why does he care?  But why is the video in there?  See, what a pussy athlete.  He doesn't like somebody heckling him.  Someone said no love and he's mad.  That's how fucking spoiled these guys are. 
[02:24:30]  I was so right the other day.  What pricks.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  What douchebag.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, fuck them.  Hate them.  Oh, guys, Nikki wants to correct us.  Cool.  Nikki, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hi, what's up?  I just wanted to call shenanigans on the jerk off that said that Davis Love is related to  Courtney Love.  Courtney Love's real last name is Harrison.  Yeah, but we just Googled it and that caller was correct. 
[02:25:00]  Courtney Love is Davis Love's sister.  For real?  Yeah.  Yeah, because Davis Love actually was called Davis Harrison.  Mm-hmm.  But that name didn't sound golf-like.  Yeah, and then she's actually related to Wilbur.  All right, you go ahead.  She's actually related to Wilbur Harrison and what inspired her was that when he sang  Kansas City, Here I Come.  Mm-hmm.  And the fact that he's.  Does that make sense?  Yeah, even though he's black. 
[02:25:30]  Nikki, how stupid are you that you had to call and correct us on something that was a gag?  It just bugged me.  Oh, okay.  It just really, really bugged me, like, just because.  If you're hot, we'll let you go without really killing you.  Are you hot?  I'm hot.  Are you really?  What makes you hot?  People say it's my eyes.  It could be my tits.  I don't know.  I'd vote for tits.  We love tits.  Yeah.  And we love saying the word.  I love tits, too.  Tits are the best thing ever. 
[02:26:00]  I'll take two droopy tits over the fucking, over eyes that can see fucking better than the  Hubble.  Hot start for our monkey group here.  What are you doing, Sam?  We just turned it off?  What are you doing?  It's not up to me.  You have the button.  Oh, boy.  My button was on the whole time.  Nobody cares about your eyes, Nikki.  Literally.  What kind of eyes do you have, Nikki?  They're green.  Who cares?  If you have Ebola bleeding from your eyes, I don't care.  All of your tits are nice.  40D?  I don't know.  You have 40D?  Oh, no.  That means you've got a big back. 
[02:26:30]  Yuck.  Oh, shit.  I know this shit.  What are you, a fucking lineman for the fucking Broncos?  You've got to knock that down into the 30s, man.  I'm just proportionate, I guess.  To what?  I'm 5'10".  Yeah, I know.  My dad's real tall.  You're 5'10"?  Yeah.  Oh.  5'10".  5'10", Norwegian?  Big fucking 40D tits?  Yeah, she's a big girl.  Oh.  Now, what's your waist?  Yeah, what's your waist? 
[02:27:00]  28, 29.  Oh, you rule.  You have a little waist.  I got 28, Jimmy.  You do?  That's where that V goes.  Just so you can see.  Start to 35, goes right down to 28.  Are you a 28 waist?  Last time I was measured, I think I was.  Well, was that more than a decade ago?  No kidding.  No.  No, it was.  All right, listen to me.  One or two ago, I'm not even sure.  Well, you're pretty.  All right, you know what?  We're hanging in there.  So, so far, we've found out you're 5'10", 40D, 28 waist. 
[02:27:30]  Now, how much do you weigh?  That is a good question.  Last time I weighed myself, I was 135.  That's great.  That means 145.  No.  You don't have giant elephant legs and feet like that British lady, do you?  No.  Oh, she scared me.  I had nightmares.  Do we have a Facebook page we could go to or like a Twitter or something?  Actually, from my job, I don't have anything.  Oh, wait.  I am on Twitter.  It's, I think I'm at Rogue Morningstar. 
[02:28:00]  You don't know?  I don't even.  You think?  Well, because of my job, what I do.  What do you do?  Yeah.  I'm a public nurse.  Where do you live?  New Jersey.  Oh, okay.  Are you married?  No.  You're single, right?  Yeah.  No.  How old are you?  I'm 31.  Oh, okay.  That's a little older than I like, but do you have any kids?  No.  All right.  Do you want to go on a date or something?  You're damaged kids.  Sure, that would be great.  Where can we go? 
[02:28:30]  Wherever you want.  You don't want to ask Jimmy that.  No, no, no.  I'll take you to a movie.  You ever see Taxi Driver?  I'll go to the same time where we track Travis Bickle took his date, too.  I wonder why she was so upset with that.  Hold on.  How about we'll go out for a fucking nice meal somewhere?  Okay.  A nice French restaurant called Roy Roger's.  Jim Florentine's old fucking joke.  Oh, did he?  Dude, Jim Florentine.  Roy Roger's.  When we first started, like 1990, Florentine would do that. 
[02:29:00]  He goes, yeah, I'm going to take you to a nice French restaurant called Roy Roger's.  I fucking have been laughing at that joke for 21 years.  Is that the one on the turnpike?  Yes.  Wait.  So you're 31.  Now, how do you spell Rogue Morningstar?  It's R, like Rogue from X-Men.  And then, no, it's Rogue M-Star.  M-S-T-A-R.  Rogue M-S-T-A-R.  Rogue M-Star? 
[02:29:30]  Actually, I follow you, Jimmy.  I follow all you guys on Twitter.  Well, madam, why don't you just do this?  Yeah.  If you email me.  Okay.  Why don't you email me a picture of you?  And I'll, can you do that?  Oh, wow.  It's TheRealJimNorton at gmail.com, and I'll show the guys.  Okay, when I get into work.  I'm only into work now.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Are you sure you're single?  Yes.  How come your thing says wife, mother, EMT? 
[02:30:00]  I'm, well, that's what I do.  I'm an earth mother and an earth wife.  I don't know.  Wait a minute.  Oh, this sounds shady.  What's going on?  You don't bang trees, do you?  When I started my Twitter account, I was going through that whole, oh, look at me.  I'm Wiccan and all this other kind of work.  Oh, hold on.  I love her.  Wife, mother, EMT, free spirit, goth queen, Wicca student, lover and hater with passion  and fire.  Virgo, music is my life. 
[02:30:30]  My family is my heart.  You're a weirdo.  Yeah.  How about my clit is my bowler hat?  So now I got to see what you look like, though.  How am I supposed to know?  Yeah.  What nationality?  Wait, you're from where?  Norway?  No, from New Jersey.  No, but I mean, what nationality?  She's as dumb as they come.  I'm Italian and half Norwegian.  Italian and Norwegian?  Huh.  So do you think you're a pretty girl? 
[02:31:00]  I don't know.  Why were you going through?  I hate it when girls say, oh, I think I'm, I know I'm pretty.  I don't know.  Why were you going through a weird time a couple years ago when you started Twitter where you  were a mother earth?  Because I was, I was getting divorced and my ex was a real dick and.  Oh, okay.  And I've been with him since I was 16 and he went through this whole, well, you know,  you'll never do any better than me.  And Kevin, Kevin from Connecticut, just redeemed himself. 
[02:31:30]  Jimmy has Norwegian wood.  Right.  That's good.  My guitar is crying over here.  Let's get the word out.  Unblock Kevin.  He's unblocked.  He's unblocked.  That was a good one.  So wait, Nikki.  Now, how long you been single?  Come on.  That was for officially for 18 months.  Oh, that's a while.  So how long has it been, I'm trying to say this gently, um, since a gentleman, since  you've had a heat missile, you know what, since a gentleman uses heat missile to, to 
[02:32:00]  push your duty in so far that you had stomach aches for three days, how long since a gentleman  has given you a stomach ache by plugging up your duty?  We're romantics on this show, aren't we?  Hopeless.  But you're, hopeless.  You're a nurse?  Yes.  You ever beat the shit out of an old person?  Actually, when, uh, when I, I work on the ambulance, when I get psych patients, if they, 
[02:32:30]  if they get a little out of hand.  Like, I'd want to bang her and just hear, not like sexy nurse stories, but I'd want  to fuck her and have her just tell me about when people died because of mistakes she made.  Like, what happened?  I grabbed the wrong syringe.  Do you, do you own a pillow with, uh, bicycle handles on it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When, when you're walking around the ward at night, do you get a little damp when you  hear what sounds like a dull thud from one of the old people's rooms? 
[02:33:00]  Oh, that's great.  Have you actually seen people die?  You have, right?  Yes.  In fact, uh, this was past Monday.  I highly, I'm going to have to say it again.  I highly recommend you never see a loved one, uh, die.  No, I, I did that when my dad passed in March.  Oh, it's horrific.  It's terrible.  You guys are killing my heart on here.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Jeff.  I'm trying to bang this broad.  Henry, what are you doing? 
[02:33:30]  Sorry.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Wait.  So, wait, when's the last, what, what, what, what?  What's the worst death you've ever seen?  Let me ask you that.  Um, my first week out in the, in the field, I saw two kids, two teenagers, death in a car.  Oh my God.  All right.  What, what, what happened in the car?  What had the car done?  They, um, were drag racing.  It was a boy and his sister and they were drag racing and.  Sure.  It wasn't two boys that they were drag racing. 
[02:34:00]  It was like, I was wearing heels and wigs all over the place.  It was awesome.  So they were all over?  Tiger on the second one.  Say that again?  So they, so you, what happened, you got there and they were already dead or did you do something  wrong and kill them?  No, they were, they were pretty much gone by the time.  Did the guy have a sucking chest wound and instead of, instead of like clearing the airway,  you tried to put your hands over the heart and pump and you wind up just collapsing his  chest.  Did you fuck up somebody's sucking chest wound? 
[02:34:30]  That's a really good question, Jimmy.  I'm just teasing you, but you're not, you're not fat.  No.  Okay.  What color nipples do you have?  They're pink.  I'm a redhead.  Are you?  Yeah.  Oh, are you?  How red though?  Yeah.  Um, well right now it's like a burgundy color, but it's like a strawberry.  Like, like if we were having sex, would I accidentally call you a freckles McGillicuddy?  No.  Is that her right there?  I don't know for sure.  She's cute if that's her. 
[02:35:00]  Are you recently unfat?  That says from Massachusetts, so.  Am I recently?  No, I'm not from Massachusetts.  Did you ever go to the University of Vermont?  No.  Or were you too dumb to get in there?  Did you used to be fat?  Did I used to be fat?  Yes.  How fat do I?  Did you have a gastric sleeve?  I did.  Yeah.  We find everything out about the baby people.  Oh my God.  You had a gastric sleeve?  Did it help?  It is.  What the fuck is that?  That's why they put it on your arms so you can't eat.  Yeah, they put it over your hand that you eat with so that you can't eat anymore. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, I know.  It kind of just did.  Wait.  So they have, so do you have an eight-year-old?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  You left out the kid thing.  But why did you say you didn't have any kids?  Because she doesn't live with me right now.  Oh, there you go.  They took your kid away?  It's Casey Anthony.  No, they didn't take my kid away.  I work too many hours.  She lives with her father.  I regularly visit patients.  Why wouldn't you want your kid?  I do want my kid.  It's just that right now I'm trying to establish myself. 
[02:36:00]  I didn't work for a lot of years when I was married, so.  Oh boy.  I like this chick.  She's a bad chick.  She's not telling us all.  No, but her interest, she has weird interests.  Scrapbooking, cooking.  I like scrapbooking.  Scrapbooking stinks.  Scrapbooking sucks.  Yeah.  Unless you're fucking, unless you're showing like beheading photos and you're trying to  match the bodies up with the fucking heads.  That would be an interesting flip book.  Match the bodies.  You could make it for kids.  You could like decapitate Waldo and Ronald McDonald and try to match up their heads with their bodies. 
[02:36:30]  Keep going.  You could do that.  Okay, so are you at your goal weight yet?  About 10 pounds away.  All right, so.  How fat were you?  Oh, I was only about 210.  Yuck.  Wait a minute now.  Yeah, hold on.  You said you were 135.  Only 210?  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  Were you ever 322 pounds?  Oh God, no.  Huh.  Why does it say it there?  Where does it say?  Where does it say that?  I don't want to say where to go, but it's this thing we found.  Wait, where's the 322 part?  Right there.  Oh, shit.  Starting weight, 322.  You were 322 pounds.  No.  And then you got to 292 pounds at some point.  And then your goal weight is 175.  You sure that's me? 
[02:37:30]  Yes.  What date is the surgery?  It doesn't...  Mine was over...  What is...  No, it's everything.  It's everything.  Yeah, this is you.  This is...  No, it might not be me.  No, this is you.  I think we caught you in some lives.  Same name, gastric sleeve, mother to an 8-year-old.  31.  Yeah, why are you fibbing?  I did have one in...  It was 11.  I had one in 09.  You have a Yorkie and some cats?  No.  I don't have any pets. 
[02:38:00]  That's a lie.  Are you an aspiring belly dancer?  No.  God.  Professional napper?  I don't like to sleep.  Who doesn't?  Goth queen?  May 12, 2011.  May 12, 2011?  No, I didn't.  I had my surgery in January of 09.  I'm not sure.  What's going on?  Before my divorce was final.  But you like scrapbooking.  Sometimes.  See, what's...  But the interest in scrapbooking is...  How good are you with tarot cards? 
[02:38:30]  It says occupation, EMT.  Like, this is weird.  Goth queen.  I was an EMT.  And I don't think at 210, you need drastic surgery to lose weight.  I did.  No, because you were big to begin with.  You were 5'10".  5'10", 210 is not outrageous.  But wait.  Something's wrong.  I didn't...  I didn't...  I didn't like the way I looked.  Fair.  Neither did anyone else.  We don't like that you're lying.  We're fat, so... 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, I don't care if you used to...  I'm not lying.  I didn't like the way I looked before I had the surgery.  No, no, but...  Nikki, come clean.  What's going on?  You come clean, Nikki.  Exactly.  What's up?  About what?  I didn't like the way I looked.  That's the only reason why I had the surgery.  No, but where are you lying?  It says you were 332 pounds.  That's okay.  332?  That seems like an awful lot.  It does seem like an awful lot.  Yeah, but you're not that anymore.  So now you're about 185.  You're 10 pounds away.  185?  No.  No?  What are you?  How did we find someone exactly like you that's not you, then?  It's the same thing.  It says...  You even have an unusual last name. 
[02:39:30]  EMT, LPN, house mom.  How old is your daughter?  House mom.  She's nine now.  She just had her birthday.  And you're 31, it says.  It says medical field.  Everything else matches up.  So why is the weight all well?  I don't know, but I'm not an EMT.  I was an EMT, and now I'm an EMT.  Right.  Do you do tarot cards?  No.  Or tarot cards.  How many tattoos do you have?  One.  Okay, and you do enjoy gardening and reading. 
[02:40:00]  Who doesn't?  Everyone.  Gardening stinks.  Don Corleone liked it.  We saw it happen to him.  Unfortunately.  I don't know.  I can't figure out how to make the orange peel into teeth.  Well, now, Nikki, I understand, but you were in Vineland.  You're not anymore, right?  No.  Okay.  Come clean.  It's time to come clean.  Yeah, come clean.  What about our blogs?  We've got two blog entries.  We don't care.  Jimmy will still allow you to take a shit on his chest, so don't worry about that.  I'll encourage it.  Right.  So it's not like you're going to lose the opportunity. 
[02:40:30]  I don't have a fat pussy, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  I'm just joking on the phone with you.  Yeah, man.  I don't know.  I would honestly, I mean, as perverted as I am, I would never ask a total stranger out  on a real date.  I wouldn't care what you look like.  I just wouldn't.  You could be a psychopath.  Well, that would be crazy.  Well, I've made that mistake before where I've just, I've led with my dick and boy, did  it cost me.  I think, I honestly think you're lying in some way, shape, or form. 
[02:41:00]  I don't know why.  They're not lying.  It's not a big lie or anything.  It's just kind of odd, you know?  I wouldn't be 10 minutes late to work to lie to you guys.  I love you guys too much.  Oh.  I think you're lying because you love us.  And you're afraid.  I'm lying because I love you.  Yeah.  Because you've heard our show so much that you think like, oh boy, we know these fucking  idiots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're, you know, we're, that's why I'm not, that's why I'm not offended.  No, don't be, I'm just teasing you.  I mean, if you get the surgery, good for you.  The only people who get offended are pussies.  So now the gastric sleeve, how do they put it in the gastric sleeve? 
[02:41:30]  Basically, it's, it's a misnomer.  What they do is they, they surgically remove 80% of your, of your stomach.  Oh shit.  I heard they go through the asshole.  No, they don't go through the asshole.  No, I heard.  Like breast implants, they go under the arm.  I hear for this surgery, they go through the asshole.  Yeah.  No, it's, well, that's the insurance company.  I got a nephew in medical school.  He tells me all this stuff.  Yeah.  That's a gastric bypass you had.  What is this sleeve?  No, they didn't reroute my, my bowel. 
[02:42:00]  But a sleeve is like that little thing that goes around that just kind of cuts off part  of your stomach and they can almost adjust it and shit.  How did they get in there through the stomach?  Love a lap band.  Yeah, it's laughing music.  All right, Nikki, you got, you got some problems in your head because, um, I'm a woman.  Of course I'm crazy.  No, you got problems though, because, uh, you, you failed to mention the kid.  Yeah.  I asked you, you had any kids.  And you said no.  So that means a lot of this other stuff's bullshit too. 
[02:42:30]  Hmm?  No one, no one just leaves out that they have an eight or nine year old.  I said, do you have any kids?  And you said no.  Yeah.  I didn't, I didn't hear that part.  I'm sorry.  How could you not hear it?  I heard you, I heard you ask me if I was married.  Just a minute ago, she said, she said no because the kid wasn't living with her.  Right.  Right.  I had to listen to the replay on my way home.  Nikki, a minute ago, you just said, you said no because the kid's not living with you.  And now you're saying that you said no because you didn't hear me.  You really are like Casey Anthony.  Yeah.  Are you so surprised? 
[02:43:00]  Is she going to end up dead in a swamp?  No, not like that, Casey Anthony, but meaning that you just tell a lot of tall tales.  What is the liar?  We got our female audience checking in.  We got Teresa on the line with Nikki.  Teresa, what do you got?  Hi, Terry.  Hi.  I have a feeling you're a big, fat fibber.  I have a feeling that you called the show and you made up this whole personality.  Yeah.  So you wouldn't get your balls busted by them.  Oh, I don't care.  I can bust my balls all day long.  Yeah, we're ball busters. 
[02:43:30]  I'm not well aware of that.  All right.  Well, I don't know.  It seems kind of fishy.  You've got two profiles going on at the same time.  Yeah, something doesn't match up here or there, Nikki.  Exactly.  Catfish.  Did you make up one a while ago and then make up a new one?  For what?  For sex.  Oh, shit.  Maybe for sex.  What's up with that?  For wild, unadulterated sex.  Yeah, for sex.  Everywhere and anywhere.  Dirty sex.  Yes, for sensual encounters. 
[02:44:00]  Right.  You're looking for sensual liaisons.  Because you're looking for black honks.  Laura, what's up?  Hey.  You're on with Nikki.  The goth queen is full of shit.  There is no way she's 5'10 with a 40-inch barrel chest and weighs 135.  Barrel chest.  Barrel chest.  Hold on.  Sven, do you have a response to that?  Yeah.  How are you 5'10 135 pounds with 40 double D boobs?  No, it's a double D. 
[02:44:30]  I don't know.  She said double D.  She said double D.  I don't believe she's a double D.  I don't believe she's 135.  Yeah, she said D.  Okay, she said D.  Sorry.  Sorry.  40 D.  Sorry.  Now you're only down to 20 lies.  Yeah, how big is your waist?  I'm only down to what?  What did you say?  20 lies.  How big is your waist, Nikki?  Yeah, what's your waist?  We didn't ask that.  I honestly don't know.  Well, just guess.  You said 29 before.  She did say 29 before.  We just tricked you.  Or 28.  Her waist is our time.  We just asked you. 
[02:45:00]  You said you don't know, but before you said it was 28.  I honestly don't know what it is.  Laura, what's going on with you?  Find it.  Nikki, why are you lying?  You don't have to lie to us.  Laura's gone.  Nikki, what's going on?  Go ahead.  I didn't say anything.  We're not going to be mad at you.  Yeah.  I think you lied because.  You know, you got kind of caught up in the moment, and it's fun just to talk on the phone  and say stuff, but you don't have to lie to us.  And we're such big stars.  I know you get nervous when you call the show. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  We're godlike.  We understand that.  We know.  We know what happened.  We just want to know your side.  Be straight so we can help you.  Yeah, that's right.  I saw that on First 48.  God, they fall for it every time.  Dummies.  They fall for your penis?  Yeah.  What?  How old is your dog?  I don't have a dog.  What happened to it?  What happened to the Yorker?  You had one.  No, I don't have any pets.  We know you had one, so what happened to it? 
[02:46:00]  You had one, though.  Yeah, you said that earlier you had a pet.  No, I said I don't have any pets.  No, but you had.  No, you said you had a pet.  What happened to it?  My husband got in a divorce.  You just lied again.  Just quarter lying again.  You never said anything about a pet.  No, I hope he just totally nailed you.  You never said anything about a pet.  But now you had one.  I worry about you.  You may fall under questioning.  Holy shit.  Wow.  So wait.  I need to be a lawyer.  This is easy. 
[02:46:30]  So you out of Yorkie?  Or a detective?  A detective?  You out of Yorkshire Terrier?  Yes.  That my husband has.  Right.  Now, how come when I asked you if you're out of Yorkie, you said no, but with no explanation  of that, this is absolutely you.  You know what?  I got to say, Jim, she's perfect for you.  You know that.  You know that.  So wait.  You were 322.  If you're 185 now, that means you're close to your goal weight. 
[02:47:00]  Of 175, which would look nice on a 5'10 frame.  5'10 or 5'11, that's fine.  Yeah.  I mean, your boobs alone are about 20 pounds.  So, you know, no one's going to judge you.  Yeah.  No judging.  So what are you going to do when you get down to 175?  I don't know.  I haven't gotten that far yet.  Just lie more.  How far away are you?  Go to work.  She lied again.  You'll get there.  She said she was 135.  You are quite the fibber.  Yeah.  Why do you?  Maybe she's not lying.  Are you calling from Jupiter? 
[02:47:30]  From Jupiter.  Yes, I have.  She admitted she was 135.  I said, what are you going to do when you get down to 175?  She goes, I don't know.  Yeah, Nikki, how far from 175 are you?  Just tell us.  I'm not anywhere near 175.  I'm 10 pounds from my goal weight, though.  Which is what?  What?  Yeah.  But I didn't have my surgery in May.  All right.  Okay, fine.  What is your goal weight?  My goal weight is 125.  It's just impossible.  How could it be?  You would look anorexic with massive boobs.  Exactly.  Do you have legs or did you lose them in a motorcycle accident? 
[02:48:00]  I lost them in the war.  That's not funny.  You don't have to.  I know.  We have a lot of guys that have lost.  A lot of guys.  Let's ease up on that.  More on fat.  We're big fans of the Army, so let's relax.  That's right.  We got shit.  Hope our friend from the Army calls back as he's fucking passed out with his leg caught  in the lawn furniture.  Right.  That fucking drunk Bob.  He's drinking a fucking Schlitz.  And lush.  Mosquitoes.  He's got no shirt on.  Mosquitoes are all over his big chest.  Oh, my.  Janet, you're on with Lying Nikki. 
[02:48:30]  Damn it, Janet.  Hey.  You know, Nikki, I'm 5'10", and 155, and I think you're full of shit.  I think you're full of shit because 135, you'd be emaciated, and I think the problem  is that you're a redhead firebush, and boys don't like that.  And what did you say?  You're a firebush redhead that's a little chubby, so you've got to lie about it.  No.  What? 
[02:49:00]  I don't understand.  What's wrong with redheads?  They suck.  Let's talk about freckles.  Yeah, redheads suck.  I know I got some red in my hair.  They fucking suck.  I'm not a fan.  Oh, that's just because you are.  I don't mind a redhead.  So you don't like them.  Well, you think I'm tan?  That's all freckles.  Yeah, I like the freckles.  I fucking hate it.  I like a good redhead.  All right.  You're a freckly boy.  I sure am.  You got it?  No.  There's nothing wrong with that.  No, no, no. 
[02:49:30]  Janet, keep talking.  She's 135.  No.  Why did you stop talking?  Try this.  No, we're trying to do something.  Hold on a minute.  Janet, you're supposed to keep talking, and then you stop us out.  Yeah, you're supposed to help us out.  I'm not talking.  You guys can hear me?  Yeah, we can hear you.  Okay.  There's just no way she's 135.  I'm 5'10", and there's no way that her physician would let her be 135.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  At that point, she's getting a little sick.  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  Do you think she's lying, Janice?  Totally lying.  Yeah.  All right, Janice.  Thank you.  Jimmy, talk to Nikki for a second.  Well, Nikki, what I want to know is we feel like you've been fibbing just a little bit,  and I don't know why you feel the need to when you don't have to.  Right.  Why do you feel...  Well, I do have to.  I don't want to...  I live a private life.  It was just that guy...  One guy bugged me, and I'm trying to get to work, and...  So you figured you'd just lie.  No, I don't mean give out your information, your name or anything, but I mean the other 
[02:50:30]  lie.  That's smart stuff to lie about.  I mean the other stuff.  Like, the stuff you don't have to lie about.  Yeah, yeah.  What's up with that?  About, like, about what?  About...  How many lies did you tell in this conversation?  Yeah, about the kid.  I don't want anybody...  Not that I don't want anybody to know, but it's my private life.  That's all.  Oh, no, no.  I definitely...  Hold on one second.  Yeah.  I mean, just because you don't have to lie, Nikki. 
[02:51:00]  It's like, we're pretty easy guys, and we tease people, but we're not going to be dicks  to you.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  I'm here.  I'm here to everybody being dicks to you.  What's that?  I'm just used to people, everybody that I come across being a dick to me in one way  or the other.  Why?  I don't know.  It's just the way I am, I guess.  Did you ever take a...  Let me ask you.  I'm too nice.  Did you ever take a...  You're not too nice. 
[02:51:30]  You haven't told the truth once.  No, you're a lying sack of shit.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Did you ever take a profile photo where you're taking the same pose as in Star Wars when  they were trying to keep the garbage walls from closing on them?  No.  Never a profile picture with one hand against sort of a brick-type wall and wearing kind  of a top with a spaghetti strap-type thing, and you're smiling, and he got some...  All right.  We got G on the line, who has to whisper, because she's at work. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, no.  What are you?  A librarian?  Actually, I'm late for work.  I need to punch out guys.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  One second.  One second.  Don't go anywhere.  G?  Go ahead, G.  Hi, honey.  Where do you work?  Oh, I'm in an IP office.  IP office?  Intellectual property.  Oh, yuck.  That's such smart shit.  I have to go to the IP office during break.  My bladder hurts.  I got it.  See?  I have to pee, Jimmy.  I got it. 
[02:52:30]  I got to pee right now.  Go ahead, G.  So, Opie, can I just sit here for the next 40 minutes and lie to you?  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  She lied the whole time, right, G?  You have a sultry, smoky voice.  You can...  Go ahead.  See, I'm a big fat pig.  Are you?  Are you a fatso?  I'm a fatso.  And you can actually see me on Paltalk.  Oh, no.  On what?  Oh, wait a minute.  What two windows do we have to open? 
[02:53:00]  What's your name?  What's your name?  It's Devil's Tale.  Oh, okay.  It's Devil's Tale.  Let's see.  I haven't been on Paltalk in fucking years.  That's a great name.  There she is right there.  Is she ugly?  Let me see.  No, she's on here all the time.  She's a woman of color of some sort.  God damn, that's all right.  I don't know what type of color, but...  Wait, hold on.  Why don't you say girls of color, eh?  What's wrong with you?  What?  G, you look all right, man.  You could say girls of color.  You're not fat.  Why'd you say that?  What are you kidding?  I was just kidding.  How much do you weigh?  You look like you're about 135. 
[02:53:30]  Me?  Yeah.  I'm 110 pounds.  How tall are you, bitch?  I'm 5'3".  5'3".  That's all I am, man.  Did you ever date a white guy?  Yes.  Would you mind giving me a little smooch-a-rooney?  Sure.  Where do you live?  I'm in Virginia.  Oh, fuck.  All the chicks who want to give me some pussy have to live in Virginia.  We lost the fat broad. 
[02:54:00]  She probably ate the phone.  By the way, we got her Facebook page, thanks to somebody.  Oh, yeah.  And Jimmy described the picture that she might have taken, and she said no to, but we see  that she took that exact photo where she's holding up the wall.  She really lied through the entire phone call.  I want to wait with this girl who's talking, the girl of color.  Now, are you mixed?  Are you black?  Are you Latin?  I am Puerto Rican-Italian.  Oh, fuck.  That's a great combination.  I'm Puerto Rican-Italian.  Wait, hold on.  Let me do some jokes.  No, no, no. 
[02:54:30]  You're Puerto Rican-Italian.  You could probably get some hubcaps and then some sauce, too, or something.  And I'll cut you, too.  That's great, Chip.  Yeah, she will cut you.  Those Puerto Ricans are fucking wild.  Do you have any kids?  No, I don't.  Wow.  Great liar.  That's weird.  I don't.  I'm 41 years old.  I have no kids.  You're 41?  Yes.  You look really a lot younger.  How come?  Do you have squatters in your uterus?  No.  I'm kidding.  I never wanted to have any fucking kids.  Yeah, but you're Puerto Rican.  Yeah, but... 
[02:55:00]  If a guy was on that phone before you, you're pregnant.  Does he get it?  Yeah, Puerto Rican cum really does march, doesn't it?  Mars, have you ever heard of a 41-year-old woman that doesn't have kids?  No.  In the Puerto Rican community?  No.  She's fun to look at.  Yeah, you're all right.  I wouldn't mind giving you the old tongue bath.  Tongue bath?  Oh, yeah.  She's blowing a kiss at me.  I'm standing next to Anna.  You can't see me.  But I'm standing next to Anna.  I look fly as shit.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Get in here.  Say hi.  Let me see you. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, there's Jimmy.  There's Jimmy.  Yeah, she's so pretty.  I wouldn't mind doing this to her.  Yeah, I'm going to give her some cyber sex.  I'm going to give you a treat.  Okay, you're going to give me a treat?  Oh, shit.  Okay, good.  She's going to lift up her shirt.  Get over here.  Sam, come here.  Everyone's over here.  Someone put a finger in my ass.  Oh, shit. 
[02:56:00]  Say, I can't see it.  It's off camera.  It's off camera a little bit.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, that's a nice dark nipple.  I wouldn't mind getting some milk out of that.  I like how she's got to talk quiet because she's in an office, but she's showing her tits.  I know, really?  Yeah.  Let me do something with her.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm going to lay you.  Who?  Chip, go ahead.  Move over here a little more.  I'm going to lay you back or something.  And I'm going to lick all the way down your neck like this.  I'm going to take my tongue and just go like, oh. 
[02:56:30]  I'm going to clean out your ears or something and get wax on my tongue and then lick all the way down your neck.  How do you do that?  Oh.  And then I'm going to get my tongue and I'm going to start flicking it all over your nipples so much that you start cumming.  You're going to cum so much that your shoes are going to make sloshy noises.  And I'm going to get down there and just start licking your fucking cuda really good.  A cooter.  I'll just, I'll open up your cooter.  I got, I got like long nails on my middle fingers. 
[02:57:00]  So I'll dig my nails into your cooter lips and I'll open them up and I'll just go like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And I'll get in there until you cum so many times or whatever.  Jimmy's so sexy with the girl.  Oh, Chip, I mean, Chip.  Yeah, I'm good.  I'll stick it right in you too.  I'll climb right, club up on you like you're a building or something.  I like the most pussy drying conversation ever.  Yeah.  Not all the ladies are digging it.  Yeah, well, you could take your dry pussy and go to the sun or something because I'm going  to give this Puerto Rican a good sticking. 
[02:57:30]  Wow.  I'm going to climb on like you're a tree or something and just cram my oats in you.  Okay.  That doesn't make sense, Chip.  I want to sown my wild oats or something.  Oh, okay.  Wild oats.  She's pretty.  You have nice nipples too.  Thank you.  I like to bite them really hard like that guy in the prison documentary he did to the  female guards.  All right, hold on the line.  Hold on the line, G. 
[02:58:00]  We got Linda on the line too.  She wants in on this.  Thank you, G.  Linda.  You're welcome.  What's up?  Hey.  What's up, baby?  You want to get some dirty talk going?  Oh, my God.  I've been obsessed with you for years.  Wow.  And if I knew it was this easy.  You might want to talk to me.  She's serious.  Oh, my God.  If I knew it was this easy to get you on the line.  Well, hold on now.  Where are you from?  Well, I was originally from Long Island, but now I've made my way down to Virginia. 
[02:58:30]  Another fucking thing.  It's because it sounds like vagina.  So what are you doing in Virginia?  I'm a registered dietitian.  Oh, cool.  Could we have someone for you?  Should have hooked up an old fat liar.  So are you a heavy lady?  No.  Were you ever a heavy lady?  I'm a registered dietitian.  No.  A big fat person.  Can we see a picture of you?  Yeah.  I don't.  You can look at my Facebook page, but nothing's recent.  How old are you? 
[02:59:00]  Oh, boy.  That's never.  And I'm older than you like me to be.  I'm 35.  That's not that bad.  That's fine.  All right.  Let's go with this.  It's hysterical what we've done to women on this show.  I don't.  It really is funny.  You know, I'm fucking 23.  I know it's past what you like.  Jesus.  Forget it.  I'm old.  Don't worry about it.  And I'm ancient.  Linda, give your stats, though.  Let's go.  Yeah.  What nationality are you?  Go ahead, bitch.  Okay.  I'm German and Austrian.  Oh, good.  Oh, God.  He's still in.  She hates Jews. 
[02:59:30]  Scoot, yeah.  Yeah, scoot.  Go ahead.  5'2".  I'm petite.  And I'm 100.  5'2".  I hate Jew.  Something.  Fucking petite.  You should be starring in Game of Thrones.  5'2".  And I am 115 pounds.  And those are the actual measurements.  There is no line.  What about the titty?  Yeah.  Well, no.  Okay.  Now, I played bra bingo with you guys a long time ago. 
[03:00:00]  Wow.  That's a privilege.  And...  You got any kids, you old bet?  No.  None.  Exactly.  What year?  I have none.  That is still a very, very tight place to go.  Okay?  Oh, boy.  There have been no children coming out of there.  Jimmy.  Look at you.  Wow, that's a weird fart, Jimmy.  Wow, Jimmy.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, shit.  He is a hopeless romantic.  He really is. 
[03:00:30]  So, wait.  Bra size, Jimmy.  Yeah.  What size is your brassiere?  Petite 34A.  Sorry.  That's nice.  Nothing wrong with that.  I've always wanted to fuck a Vietnamese boy.  Oh, whatever.  We don't deal with 34As ever.  No, that's a nice size breast.  What?  That's...  I don't mind small breasts.  I really don't.  You got to at least have a B.  I don't mind an A.  I'll tell you. 
[03:01:00]  God just gives women a B when they're born, usually.  I'll fucking...  An A?  I'll suck an A until the cows come home.  I'll suck an A until it's a D.  I'll literally suck an A until one leg is longer than the other.  I don't know how much that would hurt.  Yeah.  Suck an A into a D.  Fucking cave in the other side of her chest.  Hey, let me ask Roadhog something.  Roadhog?  Yes, sir?  Can you wait through the break?  Sure.  He wants to shoot a gun for us, Ant.  Roadhog!  Roadhog's going to shoot a gun for us after the break. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, good.  I like that.  So let's break.  Thank you, G.  As long as he's in a rural area.  It's not Midtown Manhattan.  Okay, we'll do that.  You can do what you want to do.  Just call me tomorrow, chap.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  Lars gives a call.  God, this is like 98, something like that.  99, maybe.  And he goes, um... 
[03:02:00]  What are you doing tonight?  I said, I'm playing down the village.  I'm going to fucking hang out and I'm going to meet up with some friends.  It's going to be great.  On the way over, we cabbed it and some kid from NYU left his knapsack with all his books  and notebooks and...  So, you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool is it?  A guy from Saturday Live is going to send him back his books.  Well, this is a thorn in Lars' ass.  For the minute, I get it.  For the minute, I get it.  He's like, dude, what are you doing with the fucking nap?  Give me the fuck? 
[03:02:30]  It's ridiculous.  You look like a fag walking around with a fucking knapsack.  So, I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm going to give it back.  Why does the knapsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid.  Fuck that guy.  He's irresponsible.  Fuck him.  He'll teach him a lesson.  He tears the knapsack off my back.  I said, what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street, hits some chick in the leg, and it opens up and the bags  go all over, and he's walking down the village going like this.  There's your fucking knapsack, huh? 
[03:03:00]  Are we hanging?  Fuck the knapsack, huh?  Huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  And he keeps getting in my face.  Are we hanging or what?  I went, I don't know if I can live up to this.  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  The virus.  Sirius X.  It's the OP Retreat Show. 
[03:03:30]  You guys want to hear a gun?  What's he got?  Roadhog.  As long as nobody gets shot.  What's up, Roadhog?  How you doing, bud?  All right, Rach.  I don't want to know where you're calling from, by the way.  I don't want to know.  It don't matter.  I'm on Pal Talk. 
[03:04:00]  You guys know me.  All right.  I was going to say first-time caller or long-time listener, first-time caller, and then I was  going to fire my gun like you guys wanted me to do last week, but Danny kind of killed  that for me.  Who did?  Danny killed it?  Why?  No, no, no, no.  The call screener killed it for me.  Oh.  I was going to fire a gun.  But, hey, you can guess the caliber. 
[03:04:30]  How's that sound?  Oh, can you guess the gun and the caliber?  I mean, the...  Yeah.  I don't know.  I've never tried this one, but take a...  Is it a rifle or a pistol?  Give me that.  It's a pistol.  Okay.  All right.  Where are you?  I'm in my backyard.  Where do you live, and how much room do you got back there?  In Minnesota.  I got seven and a half acres.  I wouldn't worry about it then.  Oh, seven and a half acres. 
[03:05:00]  Fuck.  All right.  Give it a try there.  Let me see.  All right.  There you go.  There you go.  Now, the phone kind of throws things off.  I would...  I'd initially say that is...  It sounds smaller on the phone than it is.  So, I would say a 45.  A little smaller than that.  Nine.  357. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, 357.  Yep.  You got it.  357.  I knew it as soon as I heard it.  I knew it as soon as I heard it.  Jimmy's the 357 key.  357.  I know guns the way I know is mustaches.  What's up with the chickens?  Or that dog.  And the dog.  The fucking dogs don't like the gunshots, and the chickens are my old ladies.  The chickens are your old ladies. 
[03:06:00]  No, no.  No, my old lady likes the chickens.  Yeah, that's what I...  So, he takes care of them and gets eggs for them, and I don't have nothing to do with  them.  Ah.  I hear you.  You don't eat them?  No.  By the time we're done with them, they're old crows.  They ain't good for nothing but boiling.  Oh, tough.  Well, the older the chicken...  Ah!  Oh, remember that fucking old broad?  The older the chicken, the...  What was it?  The better the soup?  The better the soup.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:06:30]  That sounded...  That made me wretch when I fucking...  The older the chicken, the more you want to see its head fucking cut off in the yard.  After a German guy fucks it.  Yeah, it's the chicken.  It's good.  Is it Sex and the City?  Samantha Ray?  Ah.  Is that fucking franchise done, finally?  They're doing another one.  Sex and the City 3.  No.  It's where they go to...  It's where they, uh...  They go to the moon. 
[03:07:00]  I want to see that one.  Yeah.  They go to the moon, and there's aliens on the moon, and even they won't fuck them.  See, because they're ugly.  Because they're ugly.  Yeah.  All right there, Roadhog.  All right, brothers.  Take care.  Thank you, buddy.  Thanks for listening.  Almost done.  A couple more things.  A couple more things.  Well...  I've got to get out of here because of traffic.  I don't know what the fuck is happening.  How the hell am I going to get out of town?  They're hauling some dead fucking governor around New York City. 
[03:07:30]  Carrie.  That's Hugh Carey.  For what?  Hugh Carey died because, you know, he was a great mayor or governor for New York, so  they've got to fucking haul his body from St. Patrick's Cathedral, and I don't know  where the fuck they're taking it, but I'm going to be doing an obstacle course.  So someone say, Hugh Carey am I ain't.  Exactly.  Snooki's walking down the hall.  And then, uh...  No, I would have known already.  They would have told me.  Jimmy doesn't fall for that shit, huh?  No.  He looked.  He did look, though. 
[03:08:00]  No, he didn't.  He did that for my amusement.  Yeah, so Carrie...  And then, yeah, and then, uh...  Of course, Obama's coming in here to New York.  I guess to meet with, um...  Some finance people to see what to do about the economy.  Oh, no, that's right.  To raise money for his election.  And that, oh, see?  See, that's...  Oh, I forgot for a second.  I'm starting to think you don't like Obama.  I'm not sure, but I'm starting to get that inkling.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Well, it's okay. 
[03:08:30]  We only got to deal with him until he's voted out in 2012.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Apple moves past Exxon to become most valuable company in the world.  Exxon?  Exxon.  Exxon.  Exxon.  Yeah, Apple, uh...  Apple's doing very well for themselves.  What?  That was so amazing when you think a few years back, they were, you know...  Little buddies?  ...people were like, oh, that's gonna fucking just fold under Windows and Microsoft. 
[03:09:00]  They just swallowed up the smartphone industry, man.  Yeah.  They gobbled it up.  God damn it.  Mm-hmm.  I'm even going on iPhone, finally.  I will in September once Verizon gets it.  Like, once the new equipment is, like, out for both of them, I'm gonna go right to Verizon.  I got the 5 Beta on mine.  We don't like Betas.  I used to be...  Well, it's a little buggy.  Oh, that's great.  But not too bad, though.  It's not so bad.  Do you know what I almost said but didn't? 
[03:09:30]  You, like, come?  No, no, I was...  First of all, I would have said love.  When you said it's buggy, I almost said, then you should spray rain on it.  I'm tired.  Oh, my God.  That is tired.  That's a terrible joke.  Terrible?  It's not even a joke.  No, it's not.  Oh, Jimmy's sleepy.  We're gonna do line of the day today?  Line of the day.  You guys all set with that?  What is he doing? 
[03:10:00]  He just put his legs up like he's giving birth.  Like he was in a gyno fucking chair.  And then fucking shitted his pants.  And then blasted.  No, no.  Check your underwear on that one, man.  That's not gonna look good.  Check your underwear!  Check your underwear!  Your fucked up fart mission is stinking up this whole room!  Oh, God.  Oh, fuck!  I can't get it away. 
[03:10:30]  This is horrible.  Anthony, good news.  Not in my nose.  I know.  Ooh, boobies coming down the hole.  Not boobies.  Oh, my God.  She's kind of sexy, that one, right?  Who is that?  Uh, no.  No.  That's the chick that works over at the other channel.  What channel?  I don't know, but I see her a lot.  Wave to her, awkwardly.  I kind of want...  Oh, is that her?  No, that's not her.  Who is that?  Who is that bitch?  Who is that bitch?  What's your name, bitch? 
[03:11:00]  Come here, give me some sugar.  And good news.  Barry has written another one.  Oh.  Our finance guy.  Another, like, don't worry about it.  Everything's gonna be fine.  Repercussions of the U.S. Treasury downgrade across the bond markets.  Of course, all us people that might have a little money to fucking invest are panicking right now, right?  But we got Barry on the case, Ant.  Yeah.  Uh, you could call Standard & Poor's downgrade of long-term U.S. Treasuries whatever you want. 
[03:11:30]  Unwarranted, politically charged, payback for past wrongs, or, given the government's spending habits, a long time coming.  Mm.  Ugh.  That guy's fingers should be chopped off.  The truth is that it's happened, but Treasury investors don't seem to care.  So there you go, man.  We're good.  And then it goes on, and on, and on, and on. 
[03:12:00]  You never want to see more available when you're fucking trying to read an email.  No, no.  You've only partially downloaded this message.  Yeah, look, it just goes, and goes, and goes.  Oh, my God.  My second more available.  So we're good there.  Uh, Rebecca Black.  Yeah, what about her?  She's gotta do some homeschooling because of, uh, bullying.  Why are they bullying her?  Because she had a fucking viral video.  They're all just jealous of her.  You gotta think, right? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  So they bully her for it?  She got teased out of school.  She got teased out of school.  That's kind of sad, because she, you know, I mean, I guess because I met her once, and  she was really nice.  She's not a twat.  I mean.  Did you fuck her?  Nah, she, I tried.  I'm like, yo, you want to go out for some coffee?  She said, I'm 13.  I was like, oh, I, I, I.  Nah, she was a nice kid, though.  It's like, you know.  She's gonna have a music career, don't you think?  I don't know.  She'll have something.  So why are they teasing her, man?  What the fuck are those kids doing?  What the fuck are they doing?  Nothing. 
[03:13:00]  Nothing.  Oh, no.  Oh, here goes George Lopez.  Is this a joke?  Yeah.  Huh?  Yeah, I heard the joke.  It's just a joke.  Oh, it's a joke.  Okay.  Where did he do this joke?  On his show.  Last night he said, the Smurfs got picked up for a sequel, so I lost one job because I'm  brown, and I got one because I'm blue.  He's in the Smurfs?  I guess.  Yeah.  I think himself at the par four.  Looks like that sat up just a little bit.  There it is.  Oh. 
[03:13:30]  That's actually a, uh, very good line.  You asked me to keep it on.  Put the club right under.  Yeah, but.  Right now Davis could not carry that bunker down the right side.  I want to hear Lopez.  I'm going to turn off the golf.  Frank Lopez.  Frank was better.  You want to see Lopez?  Yeah.  I want to see what he says.  By the way, thank you, Kevin, from Connecticut.  I did not know this.  Rebecca Black's dad?  Anyone?  Lewis.  That's right.  You knew that?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Is that an all-time higher for Latinos? 
[03:14:00]  It just got a little higher.  It's a long video if you want me to find it.  What?  It's a long video if you want me to find it.  Oh, is it?  How long is it?  It's a monologue.  Eight minutes.  Look how much time we got left in the show.  You want to play George Lopez?  Eight fucking minutes.  He does a mono-y monologue.  If it's on TMZ, it's good enough for us.  Oh, that's pretty good.  I need a nap.  Yeah, I'll say you should be a nap in Johnny. 
[03:14:30]  So, how long is the monologue?  Group petitions that Burt and Ernie get married on Sesame Street.  Sure.  Sesame Street has never said they're gay, right?  Nah.  They sleep in the same bed.  And they wear the gay sweaters.  I got the clip if you want it.  What clip?  George Lopez.  You got fired.  That's right. 
[03:15:00]  But he made a joke about it.  And about being brown.  Did he make a Home Depot joke?  No.  But he made a joke about being blue on the Smurfs.  And being brown in real life.  Sure.  Yeah.  I think there's some good news this morning, though.  Sony announced they were doing a sequel to the Smurfs movie.  So, today I lost some work because I'm brown, but also I got some work because I'm blue. 
[03:15:30]  That's the George Lopez joke.  Thank you, Sam.  That's terrible.  That was a joke.  Oh!  I like George.  He's a nice dude, yeah.  Let me say hi to James.  James.  What's up, bro?  James.  Opie.  How you doing, buddy?  All right, James.  Hey, what's the deal with Fez?  Every time I turn around, he's crying. 
[03:16:00]  And he really melted down yesterday.  Ronnie got on.  Said he wants to take any more shit.  But I'm just curious, I mean, because I know you guys are friends in that.  Have you guys ever had an intervention with Fez?  Well, let's ask Fez.  He's been sitting in for the last four hours doing some terrific radio today.  Oh, no.  See?  I want to thank Fez for doing a double shift today.  People don't know, man.  Fucking Fez does two radio shows. 
[03:16:30]  You're just making things worse.  We should have listened to the whole George Lopez monologue.  Yeah, yeah.  You had a meltdown yesterday?  A serious meltdown.  About what?  Well, it was Wednesday, so.  I mean, just to the point where I thought they were going to have to bring an ambulance in.  Of course.  Really?  Yeah, I mean, complaining about his heart and everything like that.  Nobody loves him.  We love Fez.  I mean, I think you should put down the top ten Fez, you know, blowouts. 
[03:17:00]  Maybe that isn't our place.  Well, we should do the top ten blowouts this week would be really good.  Yeah, I'm afraid he's going to die on the air.  I really am.  Why would you even say that?  Someone said that didn't happen.  Oh, no.  You just did it, sir.  Fez is leaving.  All right.  Well, have a great day, guys.  Bye.  I just heard the door. 
[03:17:30]  There he goes.  You know, we were getting along with Fez today.  He sat in for four hours, and now you just made him leave the show.  How come he didn't say anything?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What are you, sir?  Travis has a clip.  Of what?  What's the clip?  Oh, no.  I wouldn't mind hearing it.  You're on a health food kick.  I guess so, yeah.  Now, the blueberry is one that can't work on its own. 
[03:18:00]  It has to have something with it, like the kiwi.  It's not a stand-alone fruit.  The voice is going to get the spot after the Super Bowl.  That's, of course, if we have a Super Bowl this coming season.  That could be the greatest radio clip ever. 
[03:18:30]  You could hear the...  You know, technically, he's not wrong.  It is true.  Blueberry is not a stand-alone fruit.  It's not.  I don't know how you guys eat them.  I'll eat a whole fucking bushel of them by hand.  I'll laugh at a bushel.  That's easy.  And what does he mean, like the kiwi?  I think he meant the juice.  Like, you don't just have kiwi juice, but you might have, like, strawberry kiwi juice.  I don't think there's kiwi juice in anything.  Oh.  I have it in my coffee.  You do?  Yeah. 
[03:19:00]  No, you don't.  In my milk.  Know what I like?  No, you don't.  Any tea drinkers here?  I drink tea.  Tea?  Yep.  Hear me out.  Milk?  No, no milk.  Hold on, hold on.  No.  No.  Hold on.  Milk.  Tap it off with a little lemon.  You've already lost me.  Wow.  A lemon and tea, yes.  My mother used to fucking always leave her fucking cold teas around the house with milk  scum on them.  Mm-hmm.  So I don't drink tea with milk, ever.  Tea?  Milk with lemon.  It gets a little clumpy, but the taste is terrific. 
[03:19:30]  I just want to get jerked off.  What the fuck?  Okay.  Roland, I'll give you $200 if you jerk off, Jimmy.  I'll give you $200, too.  That'll be $400.  That's $400, dude.  Come on, with those smooth Midnight Express hands.  Those fucking juicy little fingers.  Does it have to be to completion?  Yes.  Roland's kind of like the fucking warden in Midnight Express.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  The kids. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, one of the kids.  Oh, I'm putting cum in those fucking hairy forearms.  We gotta go.  Or even Riff key.  We gotta go.  What's the hurry?  That one's turned on?  Oh, the traffic's crazy.  Traffic today, Sam.  I'm sorry.  No, we got time to stay.  Sam, are you going to get an extra, um, shit, I mean, uh, what is it called?  After show.  After show.  Where's Snooki?  She's thinking.  Where is that man?  Where is that man?  Is he coming or not?  What the hell is he doing?  I want to meet the motherfucker.  You, you put milk in your tea? 
[03:20:30]  I don't say, I say, I say put perfectly now, man.  That was, uh...  Did I go old school and say boot?  That was a good one, the boot, back in the day.  Boot, boot, boot, boot, boot?  I hear it occasionally on tapes.  Yeah, the old tapes.  It's pretty funny, yeah.  The boot.  We all did that.  Fur.  My fur.  Fur.  Fur.  Fur.  I would say fur.  Yeah.  I try to say finger now like a normal human fucking, human fucking being.  Why is Jimmy counting money?  No, I'm just putting my 20s. 
[03:21:00]  You have to organize your cash?  No, no, just kidding.  If I'm going to take a cab, I'm going to have to pay with a 20.  I don't want to whip out some of my 20s.  I don't organize my cash because every once in a while in the middle of my ones I find a  20 and it's like finding a gift.  You carry around ones?  Look.  Oh, you guys.  That's a shitty gift.  It's only a $19 gift.  Jesus.  I don't remember carrying around singles since probably fucking 2000.  You get singles when you pay for shit. 
[03:21:30]  It's change.  Nah, I throw it away.  It's the new change.  No, anything.  I pay for everything with a credit card.  Me too.  Get miles.  Starbucks.  And then if I buy something with like a 20 and I get singles, the second I go home,  I throw it in my drawer.  I can't sit with a bunch of fucking singles in my pocket.  You guys got lots of money.  It annoys me.  Oh, fucking tons of it.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Singles to me are like fucking pennies.  Just throw them away.  So many nickels and dimes in your pocket. 
[03:22:00]  In my pocket, like so many nickels and dimes.  But Don Corleone had all the judges.  Shut up.  If you just can throw them out anyway, I'll take your singles if you want.  Bring them in.  Yeah?  You want me to bring them in?  I gladly accept your singles.  Jesus.  I'd have to make two trips in the Escalade.  Oh, shit.  Load up the back.  Wow.  Quite a few.  That would be great.  A carload of singles.  You'd love that, right?  I would love it.  You might hear this in the background, but I've been ripping up singles the last two minutes 
[03:22:30]  of the show.  Why would you rip them up?  What?  Why would you rip them up?  I don't want you.  You know what a single is worth these days?  A dollar.  A dollar.  A dollar buys a nickel's worth.  Stop ripping up.  That's $5.  You know what $5 gets you?  Don't even get you a dollar.  Yeah, $5 gets you.  Get shit on it.  Shit on it like you do everything else I do.  Remember when he got the race?  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  No.  I'll take your singles.  I'll give you a $5.  Kiss the man on the plane steps. 
[03:23:00]  All right.  All right.  I'm gay.  This show stumbled to the fucking finish.  I don't mind that, though.  I love it, but it crossed, motherfucker.  People are eavesdropping and hearing us hang out.  No, they're not.  It crossed.  Eavesdropping.  I swear, if I see that fucking casket on Fifth Avenue when I'm trying to cross it, I will  barrel right through it, and fucking ex-governor Hugh Carey's body will careen off the hood 
[03:23:30]  of my escalator.  Yeah, then it'll be Hugh pick him up.  Yeah, and then Hugh carry him.  That fucking dusty skull will bounce right off your windshield.  Dusty.  90-something years old, the fuck.  You still got to get through management.  Oh, shit.  What's the play today, Rowan?  Hey, Gary, get over here.  What's the play today, Rowan?  Ann wants to talk to you.  I'm out.  Watch.  Watch this.  Later, everybody.  Holy shit.  Oh, what the fuck was that?  Who was that?  Oh, I guess they're in a hurry because they're Russian. 
[03:24:00]  Hey, Russian dolls, get in here.  Wow-wee.  Let's talk to the Russian dolls, Jimmy.  They're going to hear you.  They're going to Larry Flick.  Of course they are.  What will we talk to them about?  What's he going to do with them?  He's going to interview them.  Yeah.  He's going to point and go, yuck.  No.  What is that thing?  He'll conduct himself in a professional manner.  I want to go on record and say I love Fez because I know, you know, that could be a  problem today now.  Everybody here loves Fez.  He knows that.  We love Fez.  I don't think Fez gives a shit.  I got to throw all the dollars I ripped up away now. 
[03:24:30]  Why don't you just give me the money instead of ripping it up?  Honestly, if you get some tapes, you probably could fucking tape those together.  That's demeaning.  All right.  Let's go, James.  This is the second weird ending to a show in two days.  It's all how you look at it, Sam.  You guys are just going to walk out again.  This is the new thing.  What?  This is the new thing.  You guys just leave.  Yeah.  Everyone else leaves with a bang.  That's just dumb.  Oh. 
[03:25:00]  You just leave.  But you're not even ending the show.  But that's how real life is.  You just leave.  You don't have to be a, you know, big fucking...  But you say goodbye at the end of a conversation.  You don't just kind of back your things up and...  What?  Leave.  Why do they need to hear us say goodbye?  Like, say like a, you know, see you tomorrow, guys.  Bye.  Something like that.  All right.  Well, there's Opie opening the door.  And...  Oh, it's still open.  He might be coming back. 
[03:25:30]  I think Opie...  Yes, the door is still open a crack.  Opie, are you coming back?  Roland?  Jim?  I'll be back.  I hope he's still here.  He's coming back.  I guess not.  Stay tuned.  The after show is next.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live. 
[03:26:00]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  All right.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  That guy already told you that.  Seemed like Opie and Anthony got out of the building unscathed today.  So, congratulations to them.  What a show.  I mean, today, we really met some interesting people with these phone systems.  I guess with a show like the Opie and Anthony show, sometimes people randomly just call in  and end up being very intriguing personalities. 
[03:26:30]  At the start of the show, it was Armie Bob.  Thank you, Ron and Fez, intern.  He gave me some headphones.  What was that, Roland?  It was Armie Bob who started this show.  I would say intoxicated.  Eric, can you back me up on that?  Intoxicated, do you think?  Yeah, that is being kind.  Okay.  Yeah, slightly intoxicated.  Vague as a human being could be. 
[03:27:00]  But for some reason, we couldn't stop talking to him.  And then, just when you thought we couldn't have a more strange caller, you had, what was her name?  Nikki.  Who was on the phone.  She started telling us this story.  We found, yeah, leave one of those curtains open.  We found, she called in.  I'll go tell him.  Okay.  And, and she lied the entire time.  Like, we ended up finding her Facebook and just finding out that everything she said was a lie. 
[03:27:30]  So, listen.  I mean, there are days that, Roland, you give Opie and Anthony a day off of guest booking sometimes, right?  Yeah, they need to breathe and do their thing.  And that's when the callers come through.  That's when the listeners say, well, then I'm going to book myself on this show.  And I'm just going to call up and lie for a while.  Yep.  Now, Roland, a question was raised on the show.  About what?  Brie Olsen.  Yeah.  Not coming on our show?  That is correct. 
[03:28:00]  Is there any, can we comment on this?  Cannot comment on that.  But was it a hostile thing?  Somebody's on the hotline.  Oh my gosh, you lucked out, Roland.  You really did.  After Opie and Anthony live, you're on the air.  Yeah, it's Kenny.  Hey, Kenny, how are you?  Well, no, you were talking about intriguing callers, so I figured you wanted me to call in.  Is that what you took that to mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:28:30]  Well, what do you got?  I wanted to tell you some gossip.  Oh, okay, sure.  There's paparazzi waiting for Snooki to arrive.  Well, Snooki, it is, everybody's abuzz here in the talent department because Snooki's coming up here.  Norton is still in the building.  I think he went to the bathroom or something because he's trying desperately to get a photo taken with Snooki.  Even though Snooki wouldn't do our show, you didn't see her, did you, Kenny?  I don't think she's here yet.  No, I saw the paparazzi. 
[03:29:00]  How many paparazzis are down there?  I just wanted to call and tell you that to brighten up your day.  I said how many paparazzis are down there?  I, I, well, I don't know.  What, am I a calculator?  Well, was it a lot or a little or a few or a bunch?  There was a couple of few.  Oh, my God, Kenny, you are just a difficult human being.  Thank you.  Now, I hope he's not with you either.  You're driving alone already?  No, don't worry about him. 
[03:29:30]  I mean, he's on the show.  What do you mean, don't worry about him?  You just worry about you.  I'm, well, you usually call, this is Kenny, Jim.  Hi, Kenny.  Hi, James.  I'm farting in the studio because some hot chicks are coming in.  Um, I came back in just to fart because these Russian brugs are coming in.  Yeah, apparently the Russian dolls are going to be joining us in a little bit.  Kenny, have you seen Russian dolls before?  I saw them in the hallway.  No, I, have you seen the show before?  No, I don't go for that.  Hey, Kenny, were you surprised that the dolls were in a hurry or something? 
[03:30:00]  What does that even mean?  Yeah, that's a while.  I was just calling to restart about the population.  Hang on one second.  Roland's talking to Jim right now.  Okay.  Where are you, Kenny?  I'm, uh, I'm driving, you know, home.  Okay, buddy.  What's the Snooki plan right now?  Just waiting for her.  She'll be here soon.  All right.  Good luck with that.  Kenny, you're welcome to stay on the phone if you're bored. 
[03:30:30]  No, it's, you know, you can't, like, drive distracted.  Hey, Russian dolls, she'll be here soon.  Okay.  Well, uh, all right.  I think Jim is going to go, uh, wait in the lobby to get this picture done.  Is that right, Roland?  Yeah.  And they'll be here in five minutes.  The Russian dolls are coming?  Roland, I've never seen the show.  Have you?  Yeah.  Sam.  No, you haven't.  Yeah, Kenny?  I'm going to hang up and listen to the show, so don't play any clips. 
[03:31:00]  Well, I mean, if there are clips we need to address, we're going to, we'll have to play  a clip or two.  Well, what are you planning on playing?  Well, um, there's a couple birthdays that we were going to celebrate if we get a chance  today.  Um.  Happy birthday.  Next?  No, I mean, we were going to, we were going to honor them by, you know, it's Joe Rogan  and Hulk Hogan's birthday.  So we were going to find some fun show material that we could play in reference to Joe Rogan  and or Hulk Hogan. 
[03:31:30]  I like Joe Rogan and to honor him, if you want to give him a birthday gift, you can play some  of my, uh, my air checks because he really likes them.  He told me.  That's not an honor.  Kenny, let me ask you something.  Uh, you heard Nikki on the phone today, right?  Who?  Nikki, the girl who called up that we were on the phone with for like 25 minutes.  Oh, the fat redheaded liar?  Yeah.  As, uh, as some, as somebody who's interrogated people before, uh, how sure were you that 
[03:32:00]  she was lying?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  It's a simple question.  Like, all right, fine.  I'm going to ask a simpler question.  When did you know she was lying?  Was her mouth moving?  Yeah.  Then she was lying.  Oh, wow.  So you had no faith in her whatsoever.  Sam.  Yes?  Don't, don't talk about nonsense.  Talk about things people want to hear about. 
[03:32:30]  Like what?  You changed the subject.  You were going to play my air checks for Joe Rogan's birthday.  No, I wasn't.  You should.  He likes them.  I'm not going to play them.  All right.  Well, don't let me bring up what you said.  What did I say?  I'm not bringing it up.  You can bring up anything you want here, Kenny.  No, you bring it up.  I don't even know.  Kenny, I don't know what you're talking about.  You're speaking in vagaries.  You're, you're reminding me very much of Army Bob that called this morning. 
[03:33:00]  No, remember you said like what we were talking about and you said you wouldn't bring it up  and let somebody else mention you did?  Oh, what?  You said I was in a bad mood because Troy's not here.  And I said I'm not in a bad mood.  I don't care if Troy lives or dies.  Yeah, that wasn't nice.  That's going to hurt his feelings.  And he's not going to care one way or the other because he knows I'm not being serious.  XM?  That's right. 
[03:33:30]  No, Troy, he's very sensitive like that.  All right, Kenny, maybe it's time for you to go.  Go where?  I don't know, wherever it is that you go, just away from the phone.  Oh, you need to hang up?  Yeah, yep.  Goodbye.  Do you want to play one of the many Club Soda Kenny songs that we have?  Well, how long are his air checks?  Oh, I don't have his air...  Wait, do I have his air checks?  Let me see.  No, the air checks are in the back. 
[03:34:00]  They're on the...  They're on discs.  They're on discs.  They're not in the system.  All right, well, what kind of songs do we have from Club Soda Kenny?  Because obviously, Kenny needs some love, and we're here to give him some love.  So what do we got?  There's a lot of stuff.  He does some Lady Gaga.  He does...  What's that group?  Owl City.  Fireflies.  We haven't played that in a while.  Let's play...  Womanizer.  No, let's play...  We haven't played Fireflies in forever, and people don't really remember this song, I  don't think.  It was a big hit for a minute or two, and then Owl City just kind of faded away. 
[03:34:30]  Now Troy is opening for them, so that's where they're at.  This is Club Soda Kenny.  Oh, two shots in one statement.  This is Club Soda Kenny as he covers Owl City and Fireflies right here on After One.  You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies lit up the world as I jerked off. 
[03:35:00]  Cause they fill the open air, and leave my sperm everywhere.  You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare.  I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly. 
[03:35:30]  It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake while I'm asleep.  Cause everything is never as it seems.  Just jerk me off.  Cause I get a thousand tugs from ten thousand lightning bugs.  As they try to teach me how to jerk.  A fox trot above my head. 
[03:36:00]  A condom beneath my bed.  A disco ball is just hanging by a thread.  I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly.  It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake while I'm asleep.  Everything comes and never as it seems.  When I fall asleep. 
[03:36:30]  Club Soda Kenny, everybody.  Let's give it up for him.  He really is an accomplished performer in all assets of arts and entertainment.  And does it all in one take.  He only works in one take.  When he is completely off time, as he was in that song, he informs you,  No, I do one take.  The reason I love that song is because it's the only one that he decided to change the lyrics for.  Like, usually he just does straight covers.  But for some reason, when we went in to record this song, 
[03:37:00]  he did all the jerk me off and this and that.  And when we did a thing, I can't even remember why,  but the morning show, whatever, Taylor show, on Cosmo Radio,  Club Soda Kenny went in there, and I went in there with him.  And Kenny was on the air with them for a while,  and he was talking about his songs because, like you heard him on the phone,  if there's one thing Kenny knows how to do, it's promote.  Promote himself, promote whoever he's with. 
[03:37:30]  So he was talking about his songs that he did.  Cosmo Radio asked...  I think your guests are on their way.  Okay, let's do it.  Cosmo Radio asked for the songs.  Wow, that one is wearing a dress way too short.  Is it in a bad way or a good way?  No, it's in a good way.  They're just looking around like, where are we going now?  Yeah, I can't just bring them in.  I've got to wait for the talent booker.  Is that who they're looking for, the talent booker?  No, they're standing there admiring each other's outfits. 
[03:38:00]  Do they look good?  One looks just like a businesswoman.  The other one looks like a...  Am I just talking to...  Is it just girls?  I think so.  I hope they know English.  Why wouldn't they know English?  I don't know.  I don't know this show.  They live in Brighton Beach.  They don't actually live in Russia.  Oh, I thought they were from Russia.  No.  Anyway, as I was trying to say, I don't think they're coming in.  Wait a minute.  Are they walking in now?  I don't know whether to finish the story or not, Eric.  Go ahead. 
[03:38:30]  Finish the story.  Okay.  Finish the story.  So we go into Cosmo Radio, and they ask for copies of the songs to play on the air.  And I forgot that Kenny changed the lyrics, so the guy who produces for them just goes,  are these clean?  And I go, yeah.  And so Cosmo is a clean channel here on SiriusXM, and they ended up playing the Firefly song  complete with the sperm and jerk-me-off references.  But you know what?  Part of a producer's job is to maybe listen before you put things on the air. 
[03:39:00]  So, I mean, I can't take full blame for that.  What's going on out there, Nagel?  I'm trying to find out.  Are they coming in or not?  I thought they were, but they're being moved down the hall.  For what?  That I don't know.  I'm going to go check.  And where's Joey Fatone?  I heard he was coming in today, too.  He's walking around somewhere.  Get them in here.  Get them all in here.  This is after Opie and Anthony live.  The place to be.  I've never heard of the New York Dolls.  They're coming.  They went the wrong way.  Oh.  Goofy Russians. 
[03:39:30]  They can't hear me, can they?  No.  I don't want to mess with the Russians.  I've seen the Sopranos.  I know what they do.  I know what they're capable of.  One of them's got a fake leg.  Look at that.  I'm just kidding, Eric.  Oh, my goodness.  Look who it is.  Hello.  Come on in.  We're on the air.  Come on.  Find a seat.  Make yourselves at home.  Thank you.  The Russian Dolls are here.  Are coming.  Oh, my gosh.  You sound Russian.  We are very Russian.  Very Russian.  Oh, what happened there?  The mic popped up.  How are you?  Thank you.  What's up?  How are you?  My name is Sam. 
[03:40:00]  Hi, Sam.  Sit down.  Everybody find a seat.  Make yourselves at home.  Snooki's here.  Snooki's here.  Yeah.  It's reality TV day at SiriusXM.  So we're getting all the reality show people in.  Welcome to After Opie and Anthony Live, first of all.  Hi.  What do you guys, how many shows are you doing here?  This is the third one.  And do you have any more after this?  This is the fourth one.  This is the fourth one.  You saved the best for last, obviously.  Are you the Opie or the Anthony?  This is after Opie and Anthony. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, I see.  So my name's Sam, but Opie and Anthony were on before.  But you don't, I mean, their show's on so early.  We love your name, darling.  It doesn't matter.  Thank you very much.  You're very complimentary.  Why don't you introduce yourselves so the audience can get to know you a little better?  Hi.  My name is Diana from Russian Dolls.  Diana.  Renata.  Renata.  Am I saying that right?  Absolutely.  Renata.  Hi, I'm Anastasia.  Anastasia.  And my name is Boris.  Boris or Morris?  Boris.  Boris.  Morris, Russian. 
[03:41:00]  Come on, man.  I don't know.  I've never been to Russia.  So you need to go there.  I will.  I will.  You're very intimidating.  Are you available today at 9 o'clock?  We have a beautiful premiere party.  In Russia?  At Rasputin and Brighton Beach.  You're going to feel like you're in Russia if you go with us today.  Now, so this is a reality show about what?  The Russian community in Brighton Beach?  About Russian culture in general.  Just how multi-generational.  Yes.  It's multi-generational and there's just, there's drama, there's family, there's boyfriends, 
[03:41:30]  husbands, breakups, makeup.  A lot of drama.  Oh my gosh.  A lot of funny events.  It's a reality of our lives.  It's actually a reality, not of only our lives.  I'm sure your life has similar things, but we're showing it in a Russian way.  It's not like any other reality show there.  Yeah.  It hasn't been anything like that.  We fight.  We love.  We cry.  We laugh.  We cheat.  We steal.  We kill.  Everything's there.  We do everything.  We don't kill anybody there.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Second season.  Second season. 
[03:42:00]  Absolutely.  Okay.  The Russians seem like a very passionate people.  Yeah.  Is that where the drama comes from?  Yes.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  What are some of the exciting things that we can expect to see this season?  Well, we don't want to go really into the details of every episode.  Of course.  Actually, we haven't seen the episodes yet.  You haven't.  We haven't.  But you know you were there, though.  Yeah.  And they actually shot a lot of film.  I mean, we've been, I think, shooting for seven, eight months.  Six, seven months. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Long time.  So there's a lot of film.  Every time.  We really don't know what they're going to choose and pick, but the whole time, it was drama.  Not something we created.  It was just part of our lives.  So tell me.  But there's a lot of things going on with assisted reality these days.  People always say, you know what assisted reality is?  They take these reality shows, and they call it a reality show, but they're giving them a guideline.  They're saying, okay.  No, there is no guideline.  No script.  Nothing at all.  And we told them exactly what our lives were about.  My boyfriend and I got back together on the show. 
[03:43:00]  Diana had her breakups on the show.  Everything's real.  But you didn't set up situations for the camera?  No, not at all.  No, not at all.  No, not at all.  Everything was real.  Renata screwed up my schedule completely.  I mean, I'm really pissed about it.  Yeah.  It was really, you know, things going along in our lives.  Those two beautiful girls are living together.  So obviously, you're going to watch some dramas.  A lot of things happen in our apartment.  A lot of things, yeah.  Now, your accents are not as heavy as their accents. 
[03:43:30]  The reason is...  I came here at three years old.  At three years old, and I came at 27 almost.  You did.  And I'm still 27.  Well, I came...  Diana came here when she was a little girl as well.  I came here when I was 15, but I'm hanging all my life with Russians.  So it's...  I feel Russian.  I mean, I'm not Americanized, as a lot of people are here.  But I like it.  Yeah.  I like my culture.  I like everything about Russian. 
[03:44:00]  I'm 27 and never, ever even heard one word in English.  It's very difficult.  Of course.  I've been here for 20 years.  Wow.  I'm 27.  Well, you look fantastic.  Thank you.  That's what I want to say.  The Russian genes.  I want to hear it.  Yes.  People will have absolutely great insight on our lives.  And I really hope that this will bring the community up.  I mean, we're not bad.  We're not bad people.  We don't just drink vodka and curse and do bad stuff. 
[03:44:30]  We're actually normal people.  The way we have fun, the way we have fun, I don't think any community has fun.  What do you mean we're normal?  We're absolutely adorable.  We're absolutely adorable.  You're adorable.  We're just original.  We're very original.  We like chic things.  Our women are gorgeous.  Apparently.  Yes.  Thank you.  And they like chic things.  We wake up like this this morning.  And they deserve it because they're great wives, great girlfriends.  I also like that you say chic things. 
[03:45:00]  Yes.  Like it's just a very...  Expensive cars.  Yeah.  You know, a lot of girls like big diamonds.  Fers.  We like good life.  But tell me this, Boris.  The show is called Russian Dolls.  You're a very masculine man.  Very aggressive, by the way.  That's what a Russian doll looks like.  Just like you.  Right.  He's the husband behind the Russian doll.  I'm the husband behind the Russian doll.  Okay.  So it's more focusing on the ladies.  Yes.  Yes.  But you're the husband behind it.  But since there are generational differences, younger girls have boyfriends. 
[03:45:30]  Their relationship and older women have husbands and they're our relationship.  So that's how it's intermixed.  And for me to flirt with you, I need to have such a strong man next to me.  You know that.  Yeah.  Well, we're not really flirting, Boris.  We're just sort of...  No.  I just want to make sure that's why I'm here.  He's very strong.  Yeah.  I'm glad we have a full table separating us.  What did you guys think of Rocky when Ivan went down?  Did you think that was kind of like... 
[03:46:00]  We knew it was just for the moment.  You know, it's not going to last long.  Right.  And it didn't.  No.  So I've been re-watching The Sopranos lately and Russians on that show are portrayed as  the only people that are as tough as the Mafia.  How did you guys feel about the way Russians were portrayed?  I don't want to really go into comparing Russians and Italians.  I love Italians.  I have a lot of Italian friends.  I personally think that the Mafia, quote-unquote, doesn't exist. 
[03:46:30]  No.  We're all friends.  We're all sitting at the same table.  Whatever you say, Boris, I'm with you.  I'm on your side.  That's how I feel most of the time.  Do you know, we both of us are very passionate.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  I guess that's the...  Actually, we love to spend our time in Italy.  I think it goes all together.  Every Russian is just passionate, filled with so much life.  And the show has a lot to show that.  Now, the two young ladies, obviously, you grew up, or at least from the time... 
[03:47:00]  When did you move here?  When I was three.  Okay, so both of you, from the time you were a little kid.  And I'm 24 now, and I'm single.  Yeah.  And my number is.  I was going to ask about this, though.  And what are you doing?  At 9 o'clock today, we have a beautiful premiere party at Rasputin.  Do you want to go with us?  Where is Rasputin?  Brighton Beach.  So Brighton Beach, at 9 p.m. tonight?  You want to go?  Yeah, I mean, I would like to.  Absolutely.  Get our number.  I will.  But let me ask you.  24 years old and single.  For a guy who's maybe outside of your cultural circle to approach you, it seems like maybe 
[03:47:30]  one-on-one, it's like, okay, yeah, this is good.  But then with all this heavy, passionate Russian influence behind...  I would say guys are scared to approach me.  And you guys have to stop being wimps and just come up to me, and that'll show me how tough  you are.  She actually just told me before the show that I'm not her type.  Yeah, I like dark features.  I'm so glad.  I'm so glad you're not her type.  First of all, she's 25 years younger.  I'm very glad.  I mean, that's not an issue.  The issue is that she doesn't like my type. 
[03:48:00]  The truth comes out.  What's the relationship between you two and the two young ladies, between Boris and Diana?  The relationship in the show?  In the reality?  How are you...  Oh.  Well, how do you come together?  Renata is my wife.  Okay.  Renata is your wife.  I met 15 years ago.  And we're all from the same neighborhood, and Diana and I live together.  We've been casted to the show.  It's...  We didn't know each other.  We all somehow know each other.  My family knows Renata, Boris, and the other cast members, so it's like a closed little...  We live in New York, but actually New York is a very small town, so a lot of people know 
[03:48:30]  each other.  No, at this point we have friends.  We're definitely not competing.  Everything is fine.  And I have to ask you, my fiancé, before me, was dating a Russian guy.  He was born here, but his parents were Russian and everything, and she said that he had major  issues with attachment to his mother.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's terrible.  Does that happen?  Do you know how annoying that is?  Does that happen a lot?  It's like you're going on a date with a guy and his mom.  Like, come on. 
[03:49:00]  I just cut the umbilical cord.  Mothers, especially Russian mothers, I know, are very nurturing to their sons, and they're  always there for them.  And they spoil them with love, and that's what happens.  I know when I'm going to have kids, I'll be the same way, but to be on the other end,  it's just terrible.  It's not a bad thing.  It's not a bad thing.  It's actually like Italians.  Italians have a very great sense of family.  Russians have, if not greater sense of family.  But mothers need to let go.  I have 24 years old son.  I promise not to be like that.  Thank you. 
[03:49:30]  That's the way to be, because you want him to have the best relationships he can have.  The show is on Lifetime.  Lifetime.  1030.  1030 on Thursdays.  Every Thursday for 12 episodes.  Tonight is the first premiere.  Tonight is the first premiere.  And we haven't watched it yet.  America, America, enjoy it.  Watch it with us.  And we really hope that you're going to vote for Russians.  And there's a character for everyone, so everyone can relate to some kind of situation on the  show.  Well, I can't wait to see it.  And they say Lifetime is television for women, but this show is obviously television for 
[03:50:00]  everyone.  Lifetime is really, Lifetime is really going the full speed forward with the show.  And we really thank them for that.  It hasn't been, I think, in a long time that the show is promoted the way the Russian dolls  are.  So we're really excited about it.  Thanks, America.  Well, thank you, Russian dolls.  Tonight at 1030.  Thank you.  Thank you for coming on.  Stay thirsty, guys.  Thank you so much for having us.  We love you guys.  I'm going to take a picture with all of you.  I love it. 
[03:50:30]  Come right over here.  Okay.  Let's just, we're going to leave the mics on because there's only me here.  So I'm going to keep talking while we're taking the picture.  So you're actually on the air?  Yeah, we're live.  All right.  We're live taking pictures.  Yeah, we're going to take a picture.  Because when else am I going to get this opportunity?  Eric, can you handle it?  Go with us.  What do you mean, what else?  Take your fiance.  We don't mind.  No?  No.  Hurry, sir.  Okay.  Okay.  Get in.  Eric, you're supposed to be talking.  No, you were doing a good enough job. 
[03:51:00]  They're posing.  They're posing.  They're posing.  Oh, there you go.  What's your name, sir?  Alex.  Are you on the show?  I'm the driver.  Well, now you're famous.  I'm the famous driver.  Alex is smart.  He saw an opportunity and he took it.  Stick with Alex.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, Russian Dolls, Bors.  I'm actually the groupie.  Alex, everybody.  Bye.  Take care.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Right there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you guys doing?  I'm taking water.  Help yourself.  I hope that one wasn't open. 
[03:51:30]  Thank you, ladies.  Man, those Russians are some good looking people, Eric.  They smell good.  They smell good.  They look good.  And let me tell you, that one.  Boris could beat the shit out of everyone here.  That's why his wife is sitting there talking about me flirting with her.  And I'm going, Boris, relax.  Well, you notice how she spaced herself at least two people away from him so she could be right  next to you.  She really, I mean, her vibes were on top of things.  Roland's looking at me.  I don't know what his intentions are, but what about that? 
[03:52:00]  I'm going to stick with the blonde, Eric.  Yeah.  The dark, I think her name was Diane or Diana.  The other one, who had a more Russian name, I already forgot what it was, with the dark  hair.  She was wearing almost no clothing.  Yeah.  So I'll give that to you.  The, uh, she, she had a bra with a really thin white shirt.  Yeah.  Did she have four newspapers?  She got zero stars.  Obi said one of the newspapers gave it three stars. 
[03:52:30]  Oh, did?  But the other one gave it zero?  Yeah.  Well, guess what?  We just gave him a lot of great publicity, didn't we?  Dude, she was hot, though.  I told Eric, I'm going to take pictures.  Yeah, she looks like she's now wearing underwear.  I'm going to take the blonde and you guys fix the nose a little bit.  Well, you're going to have to fight Eric for it.  Okay, here, New York Post today.  Do I?  Oh, if Mrs. Niggles, while I'm listening, Eric wants to take the brunette, is that okay  if I take her instead?  How about put headphones on so when people are talking you don't just jump in on that  thing?  Ouch.  Um, New York Post.  Yeah, but still, though, they're hot, though.  Gave it two and a half stars. 
[03:53:00]  Two and a half stars from the New York Post, okay.  Yeah, the Posts are boasting sometimes.  What's the Daily News say?  Where did they get zero stars?  You made that up, Roland.  That's why I went to look.  Yeah, he makes things up all the time.  He just lies.  Uh, you know what?  What?  The Daily News doesn't even have a review on it.  So I guess that's zero stars.  There's a big thing for Joey Fatone, which, by the way, are we getting Joey?  Is he coming?  Yeah, get Joey Fatone in here.  Bye, bye, bye.  Are we going to get him?  Don't push me.  You're the talent booker. 
[03:53:30]  Don't push me.  Who else am I supposed to ask?  Don't be there.  Did you hear me talking in your hair phones?  In your hair phones?  Yes, of course.  Okay, because you're talking.  Roland is going, hi, Sam.  I like Italians.  Roland's the only one who books an interview and then sabotages it.  Pips, did you ever, Pips, the Ron and Fez intern.  I'll go check on the Fatone.  Yeah, let's get Joey Fatone in here.  Let's fucking really work this show.  You're the Ron and Fez intern we've had on before.  Yeah.  You were on, I think, last week with Troy talking about all the ladies that you two have gone through. 
[03:54:00]  That's it, yeah.  Just slinging it around.  Oh, my goodness.  Kevin from Connecticut is actually writing in Russian on instant feedback.  The man's a genius.  I'm so glad Opie unbanned him.  Pips, have you ever been with a Russian woman?  Two.  Oh, my God.  Are they insane?  Yes.  They strike me as crazy people.  They're crazy.  One was, didn't know what she wanted, so she would cry constantly, and she sucked in bed.  So when I was fucking her, she just laid there.  She didn't do anything. 
[03:54:30]  You see, Marcito, this is the kind of honesty you got to respect in an intern.  Yes.  No name doesn't have it like this.  The other one was more crazy.  She was a model for New York, and she did all that shit, but she fucking-  A model?  Yeah, she wanted me to fuck her from behind while half her body was out the window of an apartment building.  Oh, my God.  And I was like, I'm not doing that.  Why not?  It was the middle of the day.  It was the middle of the day.  That sounds like a great idea to me.  Well, you pull the shade down, so they're not going to see you from the torso up. 
[03:55:00]  Ah!  Mark Zito's alarm was going off.  That wasn't really a nuclear attack.  Goodbye, lady.  They're not looking at me.  God damn it.  Mark Zito saw me.  Fantastic.  Russian broads are-  Russian people in general are just arrogant people.  You think so?  Well, I live with them.  Sheepstead Bay, Brighton Beach, they're all there.  The Rasputin place that she was saying, I live right near that place.  Well, this is it.  Then you're excited about this Russian Dolls show.  I am not.  Not at all.  Why?  I can't-  Because they're just arrogant people, man.  But that's fun to watch. 
[03:55:30]  Eh.  Well, I don't have cable, so-  What do you mean you don't have cable?  What do you mean?  I have no parents.  I have-  You know, I live on my own.  Oh, my God.  You're fucking-  I have no money, so I can afford cable.  I am a real dude.  I like that.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, then I should let you continue doing your Ron and Fez job instead of-  Instead of talking your ear off.  Somebody's asking that I get the commies out of the studio on instant feedback.  Kevin from Connecticut again!  Oh, my God.  And Brad in D.C. just writes, Boris is boring.  Ha. 
[03:56:00]  That's not-  That's not even clever.  Apparently there's more Russian Dolls that we haven't met.  Are you kidding me?  No, we only got three of them and Boris.  Well, are the other-  Because the two in here were really good looking.  Eric, you were taking pictures.  Yeah.  Are those going to be up on Twitter?  Yeah, we'll put them up in a little while.  Okay.  I guess the one-  The one who was wearing the see-through shirt was Anastasia?  Yeah, that was her name, Anastasia.  Okay, Anastasia. 
[03:56:30]  That ended literally at the vag line, right?  Where it ends, that's where the shirt ends.  What's the blonde's name?  The blonde, I think, is Deanna.  Yeah.  Deanna.  Yeah.  Tell me this.  Do you think I have a shot?  With Deanna?  Yeah.  I think you have a shot with the cougar Russian lady.  Don't!  She was married to Boris!  Renata.  Renata was in-  Dude, she was all up on you.  Yeah, but Boris was right there, and he is a man who would slip my throat with a butter knife. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, but I think he'd let you get it in first.  Oh, my God.  It's a risk you'd have to take.  Maybe I'd be willing to.  Scott in Lafayette, Louisiana, Eric.  Yeah.  He wrote, Sam, you should have asked them, and I'm thinking, oh, did I miss a question I should have asked?  Sam, you should have asked them to sit on your face and make you eat your way out.  I'm glad that I didn't ask them that.  Boris might have volunteered. 
[03:57:30]  Eric.  I think you have a shot.  I think you have a shot.  What?  You are just taking shots at Boris now that he's out of the room.  Yeah.  Telephone tough guy.  Anyway, I think you have a shot with Deanna.  You do?  Yeah.  Because she told me she was single.  Well, according to her bio here on Lifetime, it says, her only goal in life is to find a man she can marry.  Well, I'm already engaged, so obviously I'm willing to marry people.  Of course, her prince will need to drive a nice car and pay for absolutely everything.  Listen, a Jeep Wrangler is a nice car, and... 
[03:58:00]  You're going to sell a lot of those wrestling figures.  Oh, my God.  This could be trouble.  Yes.  Not the one-night stand type, huh?  No, but Anastasia is, let's see, college graduate, Russian darling.  She does the GTL stuff, applying makeup, makes sure her hair extensions stay in place.  Wow, these are really in-depth profiles.  Well, listen, if you want to get to know these Russian dolls and see what I had sitting in front of me, it premieres tonight at 10.30 p.m. on Lifetime. 
[03:58:30]  And it got a zero-star rating to some newspaper that Roland read that nobody else read.  Well, that was made up.  It got two and a half stars in the post, and two and a half stars out of what, five?  Two and a half out of five in the post, and Daily News didn't even cover it.  Well, so it's at least half good.  I'm going to check it out, because now I saw them in front of me, and, you know, that's reason enough for me.  Once I interview somebody, I'm going to check out whatever they're promoting.  Eric, are you going to watch?  Yeah, I'll check it out.  Yeah.  Probably on a Sunday, because I'll forget it's on, and they'll rerun it a million times as I'm flipping through the channel. 
[03:59:00]  But, you know, talking about reality stuff, you know, I see this girl all the time near where I live, but I never saw the show.  I think you watched it, and I think Ope watched it.  Is it Jerseylicious?  Jerseylicious.  Which one?  God damn.  Is she short?  Yeah.  Does she look like she wears horrible clothing?  Oh, my God.  The last time I saw her, she was wearing a lime green tank top and a leopard skin skirt.  Pips, can you just do me a favor and type in Jerseylicious just so I can remember her name? 
[03:59:30]  And I had no idea that's who it was until the person at CVS told me, oh, that's that girl from Jerseylicious.  And then I've seen her everywhere.  Tell me it's who it is.  What are you kicking, Roland?  Tell me it's who I think it is.  Roland, what's the name of the girl on Jerseylicious?  The little one, did I like?  Oompa Loopa?  No.  Let me see.  Just go down.  Okay.  Cast.  What happened to the cast? 
[04:00:00]  It's not Gail.  It's not Olivia?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  That's the one.  That's the one.  Olivia's in your town?  I see her all the time.  Well, why don't you hook me up a little bit?  Now that I know this, that you're interested, I'll make mention.  Tell her, Sam Roberts from The Virus, from the Opie and Anthony show, from after Opie and  Anthony Live, is interested.  All right.  I will do that.  He's pointing Ron and Fez's banner stick at me.  I feel like I'm in a 3D movie.  It's right in front of my face.  He may be here in like three minutes. 
[04:00:30]  Really?  Yes.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  What do we have to do?  52?  Should I play an NSYNC song as he comes in?  Oh, my God.  Can you do the nail time where we kind of stretch it out?  Why?  Where he stretches out the time a little bit longer.  Why?  Because you may have for the full 10 minutes.  I'm not going to get 10 minutes.  Two minutes and out.  Ron and Fez have to come on.  At 11.  Yeah, but there's commercials that have to play.  Get him in here.  You know, and obviously they're setting up for an interview, so they've got things planned.  We can't just trample over their show. 
[04:01:00]  Oh, I'm getting the thumbs up, but it's all good.  Hang on.  I'll be right back.  Okay.  Okay.  Eric's going to be right back.  Roland's working on this Joey Fatone booking.  This could be the biggest day in After Opie and Anthony Live history.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  That guess was confirmed.  From NSYNC?  Yes.  Eric said he'll be here in three minutes.  What's he doing right now?  Probably leaving the interview that he was doing before this.  No, I know, but I mean, what interview was he doing?  Eric looks like a dad with that shirt on.  Eric, he said you look like a dad. 
[04:01:30]  It's a golf shirt.  Do you play golf?  A long time ago.  I'm not good at it at all.  He involves walking, so I don't think so.  You heard what he said, right?  Yeah.  Go away, fatty.  Oh, he said go away, fatty.  If you want to open, if you have the daily news over there, do you have it?  No.  Oh, hold on.  I'll run it into you then.  This is the thing about Joe.  I guess this is what he's promoting.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got to know right now.  I have no idea what he's promoting.  I was going to ask if he was, is he out there or is he still in the other studio?  What are you, walking in and out of the studio, Roland? 
[04:02:00]  I was just going to ask if he's promoting the newest NSYNC CD.  I have no idea what he's doing.  Joey Fatone from NSYNC might be coming in here.  Food and karaoke.  What?  NSYNC veteran Joey Fatone helps others get in the act on Karaoke Battle?  Pips, have you heard about this show, Karaoke Battle?  Karaoke Battle USA, ABC's summer series.  Yeah, it's starting soon.  Is it good?  So the previews, it's basically a lot of people who can't sing, and then you have a couple  who can blow away the audience.  It's the same type of show that they do all the time. 
[04:02:30]  That's great.  This friggin' show, it was ridiculous, says somebody.  The hours were ridiculous, but it's pretty amazing.  Oh, Joey Fatone said that.  Brooklyn Bourne.  Oh, really?  I'll read the whole article if we're going to wait here all day.  He says friggin' a lot in this article.  Well, I can't curse, you know what I'm saying.  Well, that doesn't mean he has to say friggin' every other word.  Oh, my God.  It'll be like one or two more minutes.  I hope so, because we're running out of, we're desperately running out of time. 
[04:03:00]  Make sure you, Roland, tell him to run.  As soon as he gets out of that studio, say, run, Joey, run.  So that way we can get him in here as quick as possible.  It's that tall when he's going to run.  You're making jokes now.  Let's see what you do when he's in studio.  Quiet as a mouse.  Exactly.  You and Eric are cut from the same mold.  Somebody's asking me, Sam, are you, Sean in Medford, Long Island, Sam, are you 5'10", 135 pounds?  I'm probably 5'9", 5'9 1⁄2", maybe. 
[04:03:30]  I'm probably closer to 140.  He's here.  I'm not sure, but I appreciate the question, Sean.  He's coming in right now.  Oh, my God.  Is this who I think?  Joey Fatone is in the house.  We're live now.  Go ahead.  So, yeah, sit there.  Have a seat.  I'm going to have a seat.  Which one should I take?  Whatever you're more comfortable with.  Does it really matter?  You're the legend here.  I try.  I'm here to facilitate you.  So, Joey Fatone, they said NSYNC was going to come and go. 
[04:04:00]  They said that's Olivia from Jerseylicious.  Do you watch Jerseylicious?  No, I don't.  I was like, who is that?  You got to.  I just found out that Olivia hangs out in E-Rock's neighborhood.  Nice.  Got very jealous.  They said NSYNC would, you know, come and go.  It was a fad.  It did.  But you're still in the business.  Well, I came and went, sure.  But you got you still doing these.  Yeah.  You got, obviously, JT is still all over the place.  He's still, yeah.  Kicking ass.  Lance Bass has a show on Sirius.  I know.  I hear.  I know.  So, I mean, obviously, you guys are doing all right. 
[04:04:30]  How did you end up staying in the business?  You know what?  Luck.  And I don't suck at a lot of things, which is good.  Is that what it is?  As far as I've done some Broadway stuff, and that's been really good to some films.  And then after Dance with the Stars, believe it or not, it came out to where, hey, you  want to do some hosting?  You were like, yes.  Sure.  What the hell?  And that's how it kind of, the snowball effect started.  And I was doing stuff for TV Guide.  I did a show called The Singing Bee.  And now I'm doing Karaoke Battle USA, hosting that now.  Yeah.  Just look at this.  You've got a whole page.  Look at that.  Right here in the newspaper. 
[04:05:00]  Look at that.  Your front page news.  Karaoke Battle USA.  And this isn't one of those cheesy, like, in the morning on cable shows.  This is ABC.  Prime time right there.  Network prime time.  9 p.m.  Yeah.  Is it on tonight?  What day is it on?  It's on Friday.  Yeah.  Friday.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  At 9 p.m.  Karaoke Battle USA.  Yes, sir.  And what beyond just people singing karaoke is it?  Well, what's cool about it is, and I was actually familiar with it before I even did the project.  There is a, I've got to think about it, it's KCW. 
[04:05:30]  It's a karaoke championship, karaoke world championship organization, KWC.  And it's been going on for, I think, since 2000, 2001.  And basically it's an organization that they have these karaoke competitions in local bars at first.  And then it goes to, like, the regionals.  It goes to the semifinals.  And it goes to the finals here in the United States.  And whoever wins that gets to go to the World Karaoke Championships, which is hosted in different places.  Last year it was in Russia.  This year it's in Killarney Island.  We just had the Russian dolls in here.  Really? 
[04:06:00]  So you're themed with the whole show now.  There you go.  Yeah.  So it's been pretty cool, you know.  Basically what we're doing is we're crowning a king and queen.  We're finding a guy and a girl that's going to represent the USA to go to Killarney Island to battle it out with all these other countries.  So this is people who are good at karaoke.  These are people that are really good at karaoke.  See, like, for us, on the Opie and Anthony show, we do karaoke, but we generally do it at live events.  Like at the Hard Rock, we put people on stage that aren't good, and then we turn off the monitors so only they can hear the song playing. 
[04:06:30]  So you just hear a tone-deaf person singing with no backing.  I love it.  This is a different show.  Correct.  But there's still some people that are tone-deaf that sing.  How often do people come in wanting to do NSYNC songs?  I would think all the time.  What's nice about it is I don't think they cleared the NSYNC songs, so we didn't have to play them, which is great.  I didn't have to hear them.  Nothing to do with it.  Nothing.  That's fantastic.  Not that it's a bad thing, and I'm not frowning upon, obviously.  I know where I came from and still love the music, but if I had to hear that all day long, I'd probably kill myself.  Right.  You know, you guys are all moving on to other things. 
[04:07:00]  You're moving on to other things, like you said, hosting and doing this and that.  And when you see the other boy bands of the era, they're kind of trying to now get back together.  Good luck, people.  Yeah.  Like, they're not exactly moving on to the next thing.  They're just trying to get that heat back.  You know what?  That's an interesting thing because you don't know where their mind frame or their set is.  I mean, I think when you look at new kids, though, obviously they've had their life and done a bunch of stuff.  Yeah.  As they're getting older, they just want to be like, you know what?  This will be kind of fun to do this kind of go-around. 
[04:07:30]  And it's not like Donnie Wahlberg hasn't done anything.  Exactly.  Like, he's been all over the place.  Exactly.  He's doing really great in his own right, you know.  I think he was the one that actually didn't want to do it at first.  Yeah.  You know, earlier years.  But now that he's seen, like I said, as you get older, you get different values, different morals, different ideas of how you perceive certain things.  And people don't realize that, of course, NSYNC and even Backstreet or New Kids, it's a brand.  Yeah.  It is a marketing.  I mean, we did great music. 
[04:08:00]  The five of us, you know, we had a great time.  And the stuff that we've done, it definitely, obviously, was a career booster in our lives.  But, like, it's one thing when, you know, new kids are getting back together.  That's more like, oh, these guys have done a bunch of stuff together.  Right.  But then when TMZ reports that O-Town is getting back together, that's more like...  Good luck.  All right.  You just say good luck.  You know, you hope the best for these people.  You know, for me, I've always been that way.  I've never been like, oh, another boy band.  You know, you want to see people succeed. 
[04:08:30]  And if they can do it, great.  And that's what's nice about, you know, as far as our group's concerned, a bunch of us  have done a lot of different things.  You know, you got JC doing America's Best Dance Crew.  He's written for Matthew Morris for his songs on his album.  He had a couple of solo singles.  Yeah, he had a couple of solo singles.  Same thing with Justin.  Lance has his own radio show now that he's been doing, you know, here on, actually, on XM.  And Sirius XM.  And then also, I've been doing hosts and stuff.  So it's been nice that I haven't sucked at everything that I've been doing.  Yeah.  Because that's like sort of the cliche that everybody expects, that you're just going to 
[04:09:00]  go and suck it.  But you don't.  Right.  You keep getting jobs.  I've been in the business now, and, you know, even before NSYNC, just always wanted to  do some type of entertainment aspect, whether that be theater, whether that be film, whether  that be, you know, who knows, being on a freaking cruise ship.  You know, if I wasn't doing this, hell, I might be entertaining on a cruise ship.  I have no idea.  But you know what?  It takes me to where I am now and having a good time.  And you were in Big Fat Greek Wedding, right?  Yes, I was.  That must have been a big, did you guys, was that a huge deal? 
[04:09:30]  But when that thing went huge, were you going?  It was great.  Well, you know what's so weird about it?  It was on the show for like two years before it actually went into theaters.  So you didn't know.  You were like, well.  We shot it, and I was like, dude, I'd love to see the film.  Can I see the freaking film?  Yeah.  Just give me a copy.  I did.  I got a copy of it.  And I'm like, yeah, here it is, if you want it.  Meaning, I was thinking, well, this ain't going to go nowhere.  And then all of a sudden, it started to end up being in the theater.  And then it just blew up.  And it was unreal.  Were you just thanking God at that point?  Yeah.  Like, this is unbelievable.  It was just great.  It was a shock, I think, to everyone, just the following that it had. 
[04:10:00]  Because everybody can relate to those kind of families, you know, the big and loud families.  Even if, you know, whether you were Greek or Italian or Jewish, whatever.  You always had those people in the family.  And it was a great experience and got a lot of other things from that as well.  You know, and it really learned from a lot of those actors that were in that film.  JT is obviously moving on to movies now.  Right.  And, you know, he did Social Network, he's doing all these movies now.  And it seems like every six months, there's another billboard with him on it.  Is it any tougher to get him to return your calls? 
[04:10:30]  No, I talked to him actually a bunch of times.  I talked to him at least two or three times a month.  That's great.  You know, he's been obviously doing press.  And I think he's, I don't know where the heck he is right now.  I think he's promoting the Friends with Benefits.  Yeah.  So, you know, for him, it's interesting to see him as an actor.  Because, you know, I know Justin is just Justin.  Right.  And it's nice that he's definitely surrounded himself with a lot of good actors that are doing stuff.  And the films that he's been doing.  You know, like Social Network was absolutely amazing.  Yeah.  The film was just a great film.  Academy Award nominated. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And, you know, I haven't seen Friends with Benefits or I haven't seen The Bad Teacher either.  But, you know, of course I follow his career because he's a good friend of mine.  But I'm willing to bet that even better than the Social Network, and I love the Social Network,  but even better than the Social Network will be Karaoke Battle USA.  I think it will be.  It's an ongoing battle.  And that's what people were saying.  Between singers.  Yeah.  So we got to, they're sending you all over the place, so we got to let you go.  All right.  Plus, I'm already way into the next show's time anyway.  We made time for you, Joey. 
[04:11:30]  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Because we had to get you on.  I'm glad.  I'm glad I can come out here and talk to you.  It's on Karaoke Battle USA.  Karaoke.  Karaoke Battle USA.
