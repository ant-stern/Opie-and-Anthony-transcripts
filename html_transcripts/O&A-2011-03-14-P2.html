<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a four-year anniversary celebration of "Karaoke Pamela," playing her hilariously off-key rendition of Ace of Base's "I Saw the Sign" from a MacBook karaoke contest.  This was followed by a segment comparing an Opie and Anthony bit featuring Bob Kelly's character "Billy the Bassman" ("Where are we going, Billy?") to a seemingly similar skit on *Saturday Night Live*, prompting crude and nonsensical jokes from the hosts.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Selena Gomez's visit to SiriusXM studios, focusing heavily on E-Rock's viral photo with her, supposedly because of her see-through shirt.  Jim Norton's trip to the Mythbusters headquarters, a clear attempt to make Danny Ross jealous (who had a massive crush on Carrie Byron), was extensively covered.  A clip of Carrie Byron's prior appearance on the show, showcasing Danny Ross's extreme nervousness and infatuation, was played.

Several guests appeared throughout the show.  Mark Zito, who also took a picture with Selena Gomez, was a significant presence, as was Joe DeRosa, whose appearance in a video with Opie led to a Twitter controversy involving a SiriusXM employee's backside.  Ron Bennington also joined the broadcast. Mikey Piff, from Hits 1, briefly chimed in to comment on Selena Gomez's entourage and Mark Zito's interactions with the morning mashup.  The show concluded with more discussion of Mark Zito's workplace antics and another reference to Opie's controversial video with Joe DeRosa.  The entire broadcast was punctuated by the hosts' characteristic vulgar side conversations, impressions, and general banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Opie and Anthony are gone because it's after 10, but the rest of us are still here.  Me, Danny, Travis, D-Boy, E-Rock, Troy.  We're all still hanging out.  The Ron and Fez people are about to make their way down here. 
[00:00:30]  Actually, Jim Norton is still here for some reason.  He just spent the entire break from where the show ended talking to management in the hallway.  I don't know what that was all about.  But we're celebrating here today on After Opie and Anthony Live  because, as E-Rock mentioned at the close of the show,  today is a very special day in Opie and Anthony history.  Today is the one-year anniversary of the day that we met Pamela.  No, not the one.  It couldn't be the one year.  No, no, no, no. 
[00:01:00]  How many years?  Four years ago.  Four?  On this date, March 14, 2007.  Four?  Jesus.  Four years ago.  It's been a long time.  This is when we met her, not when we received her entry.  No, of course not.  When we received her entry.  We were doing MacBook karaoke.  And I can't believe that was four years ago.  I was going through email after email after email of karaoke entrance.  People were entering trying to win a MacBook,  and all they had to do was send bad karaoke.  And I'll never forget the day I opened this. 
[00:01:30]  I mean, the day I opened this email wasn't March 14th,  but I'll never forget the day that I opened this email anyway.  And we'll start with that.  This is the recording that she sent in, the recorded version of  I Saw the Sign by MacBook Karaoke All-Star Pamela.  I've got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad I'm a new person.  I'm here dreaming of you. 
[00:02:00]  I don't bother when you're not the one for me.  Is it not enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up.  To get into the light where you belong. 
[00:02:30]  I can't believe that was four years ago.  If that isn't award-winning karaoke, I don't know what it is.  Of course, that was Pamela singing I Saw the Sign by Ace of Base.  Four years ago today, that young lady entered the Opie and Anthony Studios in an attempt to win this contest.  And while she was in, we got her to perform live.  We've had a lot of great musical talents on the Opie and Anthony show over the last four years and longer. 
[00:03:00]  But I would say that this is probably the best one.  Even better than Homeless Mustard.  This is four years ago today.  Karaoke Pamela.  I don't think we ever gave her a formal nickname.  I think we just had it.  Pamela from Deer Park.  I guess so.  Deer Park.  Singing I Saw the Sign right here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Let's get into it. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Oh my god.  Opie.  This is sick.  I, I got a new life. 
[00:04:00]  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad.  How could a person like me have for you?  Why, forever?  When you're not the one for me.  Ooh.  Is it up and up?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign. 
[00:04:30]  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong.  Well, where do you belong?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy, this is for you.  Ah, I love it.  I'm singing it.  Ah, under the clean moon.  For so many years I've wondered who you are.  How could a person like you bring me to? 
[00:05:00]  Under the pale moon.  Where I see a lot of stars.  Ooh.  Is it enough, enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong. 
[00:05:30]  But where do you belong?  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  You like that?  It stinks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Holy cow.  Nice.  I didn't do that.  You're into it.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  And I am happy not living without you.  I left you. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes. 
[00:06:30]  I saw the sign.  Sign.  Sign.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Look how many people are in here.  Everyone wanted to see her.  She was a star.  You're a star.  And everyone wanted to see it live.  Pamela from Tampa Park.  I saw the sign.  After O&A, it's live.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  Don't you wish that you could let your guard down to that extent?  That was four years ago today.  And that was Pamela singing I saw the sign as part of MacBook karaoke.  I mean, the thing about her is that she was taking herself as seriously as anyone ever has. 
[00:07:00]  The Ron and Fez intern just walked in.  Ron and Fez intern.  You were listening to that, right?  Yeah, it sounded pretty good, actually.  I mean, have you been?  You're a college student, right?  Have you been to karaoke bars?  Yeah, I've been to a couple.  How do you think something like that would be perceived at a karaoke bar?  Well, you know, if I was drunk, that'd be hysterical.  She put a lot of heart into it, so.  Yeah, I mean, and that's the thing.  E-Rock, you remember, you were there that day.  She was completely, 100% into it.  She wasn't doing a joke.  Oh, yeah, she wanted that MacBook so bad to take with her to college. 
[00:07:30]  And she was actually not bad looking.  No, typical Long Island girl, I guess.  Okay, well, that's not a compliment.  It doesn't sound very complimentary.  E-Rock, today was a big day on the show because another instance of a possible O&A ripoff.  Now, some people argued it, so we'll play it a little bit here on after O&A.  Anyway, this, of course, SNL over the weekend was hosted by Zach Galifianakis,  and they did a skit called Kings of Catchphrase Comedy. 
[00:08:00]  It was a little too close to something we had just done on the show.  In fact, we just did it like a week ago.  We did it again at Car Crash Comedy, which, of course, was what Billy the Bass Man.  This is a clip, just a quick clip from the SNL skit,  and if you're familiar with the bit, you tell me if it sounds familiar to you.  The four kings of Catchphrase are back,  and they're going absolutely crazy with David Beef Jelly Winfield. 
[00:08:30]  So my buddy Jimmy said, hey, man, you want to go to the waffer house?  And I looked at him and was like, hey, I ain't going to the house made for no waffers.  Beef Jelly.  Croatian import, Goran Funky Boy Bogdan.  I go to your Sonic restaurant.  I order a plate of Dobrzejki.  They tell me the washroom is that way.  Ooh, Funky Boy.  Slappy Pappy.  Oh, man.  If a Dracula is chasing you, turn around and trip the bits. 
[00:09:00]  Slappy Pappy.  Wait, wait.  And Pete Airhorn Schultz.  Now, look, nobody's saying that the Opie and Anthony show is the first to parody comedians who use catchphrases.  But there's just something in the timing that SNL chose this week to do that when, I mean, you know, the rednecks of comedy, whatever the tour is called. 
[00:09:30]  Blue-collar comedy.  Blue-collar comedy.  I guess I shouldn't be getting that wrong.  They have a channel here.  Apparently they do, but they haven't, there's nothing that's been in the news recently that would evoke that or make that specifically topical other than us doing it.  But for those of you who didn't realize that we did it or haven't heard this, you're in for a huge treat because Billy the Bassman, a few weeks ago, made his debut on the Opie and Anthony show.  We originally did this bit on February 11th of this year. 
[00:10:00]  So it was just about a month ago.  Billy the Bassman visited us again.  It was a week ago on Friday when we did Car Crash Comedy.  He was live in front of a crowd for the first time, which was very exciting.  But this is the debut of Billy the Bassman.  The origin.  The origin, yes.  When he was created in front of all of our eyes by Mr. Bob Kelly.  I want you to listen to this.  It happened just a month ago. 
[00:10:30]  And tell me that SNL wasn't, that maybe, maybe there isn't one or two people writing for SNL that are big O&A fans.  It's Billy the Bassman on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Let's really get into this.  You ready, Bobby?  I'm ready right now.  Here I am.  Reintroduce him, Anthony.  You ready for some jokes, Billy?  Ladies and gentlemen, you might have seen our next comedian down there in Bramford, Missouri. 
[00:11:00]  And also he was performing in Nashville, Tennessee.  Here he is, very funny comedian.  It's Billy the Bassman.  Everybody, Billy the Bassman.  All right, all right now, all right.  All right, huh?  All right, everybody, settle down.  Come on now.  All right, sit down there.  How are we all doing tonight?  Yo, you look like a mother of mine.  Yeah, Billy the Bassman.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  The audience has to yell out the catchphrase.  Yeah, yeah.  Where are we going? 
[00:11:30]  Tell them where we're going.  They're all wearing their where we're going t-shirts.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  All right, shut the fuck up.  Where are we going, Billy?  You guys keep cutting me off.  You guys are into this more than me.  No, we're working on this.  We're developing this right in front of your eyes.  Yeah.  Because when you hit the stage, the catchphrase is so good.  Everyone's like, where are we going, Billy?  Everyone's like, where are we going?  Billy, where are we going?  We're ready, Billy.  Where are we going?  And you're pulling in and we go, yeah, where are we going?  Where are we going?  I just got to point out that we're all in our 40s.  We've made the right career choices.  We're fucking playing pretend right now. 
[00:12:00]  No, we're not, man.  This is something you've got to take out on the road.  You could do this.  You have to do this one time.  All right, here we go.  You've got to go to the Stress Factory.  We get with Vinny and go, look, Vinny, I'm not going in there as Bob Kelly.  I'm Billy the Bassman.  Because we're going to develop this to the point where our listeners want to see Billy  the Bassman.  Would you do this one time?  Where are we going?  Would you do this one time, Bob?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here we go.  All right, we got the music.  Hold on.  Are we...  Reintroduction.  Okay.  You like your music? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, perfect.  Chattahoochee.  All right, here we go.  Ladies and gentlemen, your next comedian, we're going to bring on your headliner right  now.  You may have seen him at Yakov Smirnoff's place there in Bramford, Missouri, and he  was just playing at the Jingle Hut down there in Memphis, Tennessee.  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Billy the Bassman.  All right, man.  All right.  Here we go, Billy.  Here we go.  Here we go.  All right, now settle down. 
[00:13:00]  I'll tell you where we're going to go to funny land.  Come on, now settle down.  Now I'm here.  It's all right.  Well, it's good to be here.  Where are we going, Billy?  Where are we going?  We're going right now.  We're going right now.  I'm going to tell you where we're going.  Where are we going is right.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, there we go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, I'm just open to my grandmother's house now over here.  She lives over here in Tennessee.  You know, I thank you very much for taking care of my grandmother the way you do over  here, and she was, it's a funny thing with my grandma, though. 
[00:13:30]  She was born with two thumbs and one hand.  Oh, yeah.  Two thumbs.  I took her to see a movie.  She gave it two thumbs up.  She liked it a lot.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Yeah.  She worked for the Catholic Church on Ash Wednesday.  She did two people at a time.  Where are we going?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, now, I've got a couple questions for you here.  Sometimes I like to ask my audience a little question and give them a little information 
[00:14:00]  you don't know now.  All right.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  I'll tell you where we're going right now.  We're going right at this joke.  Yeah, Billy.  What do termites eat for breakfast?  Oh, what, Billy?  Oak meal.  Well, no.  Oh, yeah.  Oak meal.  Oak meal.  Yeah, God damn is right.  Now, don't use the lowest name in vain.  Getting his bolt in trouble.  Where are we going?  That's right, man.  Hey, fuck the...  Oh, hey.  I hate the fucking...  Just like you do, Billy. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, where are they going?  To rob my house.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking...  All right, now, settle down now, Anthony Coomia.  Oh, he's a good friend of mine.  Listen.  Where are they going?  Hopefully back to...  All right, now.  He's from my New York City.  That's why he's getting a little up in here.  Let me ask you another question here.  I'd like to ask my audience some questions, and I'd like to supply you with answers.  There we go, man.  There we go, man.  Why was the chicken happy? 
[00:15:00]  What?  Everything was excellent.  There we go.  There we go.  All right, now.  Let me ask you another one, now.  Let me ask you another one.  Let me ask you another question here.  Hey, go ahead, Billy.  We love you, Billy.  We love you.  We love you, Billy.  I love you, too.  I love bass fishing.  I love bass fishing, Billy.  You come out of my boat any time.  Me and you, we go bass fishing. 
[00:15:30]  Let me ask you a question there, sir.  You're yelling out.  Now, what do a massage therapist eat for dinner?  What's that, Billy?  Spaghetti.  Where are we going?  Oh, where are we going?  Oh, gosh dang.  Gosh dang.  Oh, hell.  Billy, don't you hate the juice?  Well, I don't know about that.  You know, sometimes those people pay my checks.  Oh, Billy.  Where are we going?  I get it.  They're money landers.  I get it.  Not going to the old steam rooms over in Germany. 
[00:16:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, where are we going?  Oh, Billy.  All right, where are we going?  Where are we going?  That's a great country.  Give us one more joke.  All right, now.  Let me tell you this.  You know, I like those Chinese people.  I like those people over there.  Boo!  Yeah, I hear, I hear, I hear.  Communism is no way to go.  I'm a god damn c**k.  I hate the c**k.  I'm sure you're saying c**ks.  Now, they're c**k, but I don't know. 
[00:16:30]  Anthony Coomey, getting a good friend of mine from New York City.  We've got to keep it together.  All right, now.  Billy the Batman.  You know, I'll tell you this, though.  That's right, Billy.  I'll tell you this.  Let me tell you this.  I'm going to tell you right now.  Did you hear about the look-alike competition in China?  No?  Yeah, everybody won.  Oh, where are we going?  Where are we going?  Oh, what a** look at life.  Yeah, they do.  They do.  And where are we going?  Same haircut.  Over and over.  Where are we going?  Oh, God. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord.  Where are we going?  I don't know, but it's going to be funny.  That's what I'm saying.  That's where we're going.  Oh, someone brought their wife into the audience.  Where are we going?  Oh, look at that.  Where are we going?  Where are we going, huh?  Someone get a newspaper and clean up after that woman.  Where are we going?  All right.  Oh, God.  I love it. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Now, let's get back into some jokes here.  What are you saying?  What are you saying?  Come on, Benny.  All right, now.  Why do flies wear, what do flies wear on their feet?  Where are we going?  I'll say it again now.  I want you to pay attention.  Why, what do flies wear on their feet?  Hold on.  There's only one.  Shoes.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Shoes.  That's shoe flies.  Shoe flies.  Shoe flies. 
[00:18:00]  Shoe flies.  Shoe flies.  You ever see those films where flies are flying all around the little f***ing heads?  Oh, man.  I don't know what that is.  Oh, God.  That's when the hungry and the sent them over there.  And the flies are flying around the little f***ing heads.  Billy.  Oh, where are we going?  Where are we going?  Oh, we going, Billy.  All right, now, guys.  All right.  What's Mary short for?  I don't know.  Where are we going?  She's got no legs.  Where are we going?  Where are we going? 
[00:18:30]  Where are we going?  All right, now, guys.  Thank you very much for coming out and seeing me.  Tennessee, you are my favorite place in the world.  Let me hear you.  Where are we going?  All right.  Bobby the Bassman.  Bobby the Bassman.  Safe driving on the way home.  Where are we going?  What the f***?  That was Billy the Bassman.  He'll be back tomorrow night.  After O&A.  Live.  Where are we going, indeed.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  That was Bob Kelly portraying Billy the Bassman. 
[00:19:00]  Some people may say parallel thinking.  Some people may say that there are some Opie and Anthony fans writing for SNL this week.  But irregardless, I know people love that word.  We can't.  We'll never know, I suppose, because if somebody did rip us off, it's not like they're ever going to admit it.  Selena Gomez was here today.  Mark Zito, you saw Selena Gomez.  You just walked in.  She's very attractive.  I saw her when she first got in, because we have stars and celebrities all the time here at Sirius. 
[00:19:30]  Selena Gomez walked in here with like 10 people easily.  Yeah.  There were a ton of people in her entourage.  And I didn't realize you had a crush on her.  I do.  I didn't realize it either until I saw her.  And then I was like...  I heard you got a picture with her.  I did.  Very, very...  I was walking by and they were taking a bunch of photos.  E-Rock, you became famous for your Selena Gomez photo.  Yes, it made a lot of celebrity blogs.  Because, unbeknownst at the time, her shirt was see-through.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:20:00]  E-Rock, very classy of you.  Mark Zito, is there any see-through shirt going on in your photo?  Now, I've heard you on the Ron and Fez show before, and I thought you were gay.  That's what I heard on the Ron and Fez show.  That's what you heard there?  No.  Yeah.  I'm not gay, Sam.  I'm a proud heterosexual.  And E-Rock had a question that he whispered in my ear, but I'll ask it, E-Rock.  He wanted to know, how did you end up meeting Selena Gomez when she was just doing the morning mashup?  She was actually in the lobby.  Of course, on Friday, Roland accused you of hanging out with the morning mashup all the time. 
[00:20:30]  That's true, he did.  It doesn't look good for you.  Well, you know what, I can be honest, they're friends of mine, and I'm not going to ditch my friends just because I work for another show.  Good for you, Mark Zito.  Good for you.  That's what I've always appreciated about you.  You're not the only one with a crush.  Danny Ross, who works here for the Opie and Anthony show, you all know Danny.  He has a crush on Kerry Byron from the Mythbusters.  And he was getting all worked up because over the weekend, Jim was in San Francisco,  and he had tweeted pictures of him with Kerry Byron in the Mythbusters headquarters. 
[00:21:00]  Danny not only has a crush on this woman, but he's a huge Mythbusters fan, so that's his dream come true.  I talked to Norton after the show, as this clip will obviously prove,  about whether or not he just simply went on the Mythbusters trip to make Danny jealous,  because he said on the air he didn't even know anything about the Mythbusters.  Jim, you were at the Mythbusters compound.  You're not a Mythbusters fan.  Did you only go to make Danny jealous? 
[00:21:30]  I did, yeah.  But it was a nice invitation.  Hold on, let's get my jacket on.  And I felt that it was nice to go because they invited me, and I really wanted to...  Hold the elevator!  I really wanted to go.  Sorry, I was getting out of here at 10.  Thanks, Jim.  Sure.  Yes, 10.  I talked to him right after the show.  I promise it wasn't during a commercial break.  But we also talked to Danny about this, because it was obvious that Jim had no intention of going, 
[00:22:00]  and apparently he texted Danny just to rub it in his face.  Danny didn't get a chance to tell his side of the story on the air.  So this is Danny explaining his feelings, though, were very complicated for Carrie Byron.  I farted.  That smells bad.  Danny, Jim just told a story about being in San Francisco.  Not only did Carrie Byron tweet him and invite him, she actually emailed him and went to his show.  How does this all make you feel? 
[00:22:30]  I should feel worse.  And I was very jealous when Jimmy texted me the picture of him and Carrie.  And the fact that she did remember me in her initial contact to Jim really did soften the blow.  Did it make you feel good that she remembered your name?  Yes, it actually did.  I actually thought that Jimmy was just kind of fucking with me.  But being that he just read it on the air, it was kind of confirmation.  So I was like, well, you know what?  That's kind of cool that she knows me by name and remembers that.  That's pretty sweet.  What is it about Carrie Byron that makes your heart go pitter-patter the way it does? 
[00:23:00]  She's hot.  Just hot, sexy, fucking smart.  Or it's like a little, just enough nerdiness where it's sexy but not enough where it's like you don't want to fuck her anymore.  Plus you want to hang out with your friends, the Mythbusters.  Hell yeah!  Grant and Tori and Adam and Jamie.  Oh, we would have the best time.  So today, are you sad that Jim got to experience something that is your dream and that she's a fan of Jim?  Or are you happy that Carrie remembers your name? 
[00:23:30]  Both.  I'm happy that Jim had his nice, sweet time out in San Francisco.  And I'm also happy that they went to Jim's show and had a great time.  And I know that when I am out in San Francisco, I will definitely be visiting Carrie and the Mythbusters.  No problem.  Are you going to make a trip just for that?  Yes.  Well, it's worth it to me.  I mean, I would like to go to San Francisco anyway, but being there, going to see Mythbusters, getting a whole tour of the facility, I think that would be an awesome time.  Do you think you have a shot?  Never.  Never. 
[00:24:00]  You have to love the passion that he has for these Mythbusters and for Carrie Byron especially, that he's willing to travel all the way to San Francisco as Danny just to get a tour of the Mythbusters compound.  But it is a special treat.  Not many people get to do that.  We were able to get a relationship going with Carrie Byron after her first appearance right here on the Opie and Anthony show.  She came in.  She sat in studio for a long time.  She had a great time.  And she was able to meet Danny.  That's how she remembered his name. 
[00:24:30]  She actually emailed Jim and said, hey, you should come down to the compound, to the Mythbusters compound.  It would really make Danny jealous, which is the only thing that made the entire experience okay for Danny.  He wasn't as jealous because he found out that she remembers his name.  So we're going to play Carrie Byron's appearance on Opie and Anthony show just to remind you all if you haven't heard or if you have heard or if you haven't heard to tell you all exactly how Danny feels about her and what it was like. 
[00:25:00]  Because this is the first time that Danny got to see this woman in person, the woman of his dreams.  We had to edit it down quite a bit because, as we said, she was in here for like an hour, an hour and a half.  She had a great time.  But we're condensing it for you, so we have a little time to do things like this.  Play some clips.  Go inside.  Go a little in-depth.  That's what we do for you.  It's Carrie Byron from the Mythbusters on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  And walking down the hall, Danny's favorite. 
[00:25:30]  Danny's losing his mind.  He's been losing his mind for the last couple of days.  I know.  My heart rate just shot up like double.  Carrie Byron from Mythbusters.  Danny is losing his mind.  Poor Danny.  She is his favorite of all time.  It's going to be embarrassing for Danny.  Look at you.  Are you all right?  I'm already hot and sweaty.  Hi, Carrie.  How are you?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  How are you?  He's very...  You might want to watch out on you right there. 
[00:26:00]  He's very nervous.  I'm trying not to look.  If I look, it's going to be over.  He is your biggest fan by far.  Smitten.  Carrie, I'm...  I can't look at her.  He's losing his mind.  Are you kidding me?  This is not a joke.  Oh, my God.  This is not a joke.  He's losing his mind.  Nice to meet you.  I'm Jim.  Oh, she has such a nice handshake, Danny.  He really is losing his mind.  Yeah, Danny has a crush on you.  I promise he doesn't bite.  Can you at least hug him and get it out of the way?  Just hug him.  He can't even love him.  Hug him, and then we can do a weird interview.  Oh, my God.  See, I told you she smelled good. 
[00:26:30]  I told you.  He showered and everything.  Wow.  He absolutely...  We all love you, but he really loves you.  He's crazy.  In a creepy way.  He's all right.  He's all right, though.  He's already making me feel very comfortable.  I've already made sure to, like, just hide in my little corner so I don't get too close  or no sharp movements or anything.  He's already getting it.  I can feel it.  He very rarely likes girls who are over 18.  It's kind of nice to see.  An actual adult.  Why don't we ask Danny, why do you like her so much?  Well, you know, I mean, I'm a big...  Look at her, eh? 
[00:27:00]  I'm a big fan of the show in the first place.  I love Mythbusters.  I've seen, I think, probably every one a thousand times.  Yeah, I love the show.  But it's just the whole package, you know?  It's the beauty.  It's the brains.  It's the whole thing right there.  Aw.  Look at this.  I'm taking red.  Okay.  I could probably really creep her out, because I know you did some event in D.C. at the mall  over there over the weekend, and I was crazy enough, because I didn't know we were getting  you in studio at that point.  I had considered driving into D.C. just to go. 
[00:27:30]  That's great.  Seven hours there and back.  Danny, why don't you just pull out a piece of her hair from your pocket?  If she's willing to...  If she's willing to park with some, I'll definitely keep it in my own.  If Lee Malvo and John Muhammad showed up at her D.C. event, she would have been less  creeped out.  You are really a ghoul.  Well, I didn't know we were going to get her in, and I was just like...  Yeah, you know, I knew you were in D.C. and you were staying at the Radisson, so I was  tempted to go and knock on your door and invite you to the show.  He's usually not this creepy.  Yeah, he really is.  I've never seen him like this.  He usually keeps himself very shy.  You guys really love him. 
[00:28:00]  You torture him like this.  Yeah.  We're just getting started.  Do you get that a lot?  I mean, you must.  I mean, you know, being a very beautiful woman on what is typically just a couple of guys,  you must get this all the time.  No, not really.  I mean, we're very insular.  I mean, we have just the few of us working, very skeleton crew, and I'm kind of a sister  to them now.  They don't look at me like that.  Yeah, but I think the fans, though, because you are getting some geeky guys that like watching  the show, although the show does cross over many people. 
[00:28:30]  You mean the non-geeky people?  Yeah, yeah, some geeky, non-geeky people, but you get a lot of geeky people, and you  are like queen of the geeky people.  I'll take it.  That's a compliment.  I love that.  Because I won't put it as mushy as Danny put it, but it is very good to see a woman such  as yourself doing things that are kind of cool and mechanical and geeky and fun.  Kind of cool?  Kind of cool.  I shoot a .50 caliber gun.  I know.  One day, the next day I go to the bomb range. 
[00:29:00]  I have the coolest job.  I own that rifle.  I own a Barrett .50 cal.  Really?  I take it out to Calvert.  Aren't they, don't they like hurt your head to shoot?  I wear earplugs.  Yeah, no, but I mean, like the concussion makes me feel like you've been punched in  the face.  Like, it's such a, maybe I'm just a pussy.  You are.  I like it.  I like that feeling.  It's a strange feeling you can't explain.  Yeah, like things move around you.  If you have stuff on tables, like three feet away, it just flies off the table.  You should get along very well. 
[00:29:30]  I like this.  Carrie's chopped down a tree with a minigun.  What have you done?  How many trees have you took out?  Not many, but I did blow up a watermelon with 50 cal.  It's because some guy was holding it.  You weren't aiming at the fruit.  Desert Eagle.  50 cal Desert Eagle.  That's pretty impressive.  You guys have gotten into shooting.  You've gotten to shoot some fun guns.  I know Jamie does a lot of the shooting when you're doing the ballistics into the pool,  which is very surprising.  I thought the 100 caliber was going to go deeper than the smaller caliber. 
[00:30:00]  So now you know.  Go figure that out.  When you're being chased by villains or good guys in some cases, die.  Now, what was the initial thing?  Because years ago when the show first started, it was just Adam and Jamie, two knock-around  guys just building stuff and blowing things up and everything.  What was the basic idea behind bringing you on board and the other people that came on  after that?  Well, I've kind of been there since day one because I took an internship with Mythbusters.  Well, actually with Jamie as a special effects artist. 
[00:30:30]  On my first day as an intern was the first day of filming.  So you can kind of see in some of the early episodes when they pan across, I'll be like  laughing in the background and that kind of stuff.  I never noticed that.  And then it was really just kind of a small show on a cable channel.  You know, I didn't think anybody was watching and they happened to need a woman's backside  for one of their...  Yes.  The famous.  That was for the plain toilet myth.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  That was the first thing she did.  That was the first thing she did.  That was the first thing she did.  Yeah.  So, you know, hey, I was the only girl at the shop. 
[00:31:00]  Did you have any reservations about that?  No, I really thought nobody would really see it.  I didn't think it'd be the first thing that would come up when you Google my name.  I know.  Now it just comes up.  It really is a...  How do you say this?  A terrific photo.  There had to be...  But, I mean, come on.  There had to be shenanigans going on that day.  Like, it's your first day doing stuff and like, oh, what can we have her do?  Oh, I know what we need.  Yeah, let's put her in skin-tight spandex.  No, mull her ass.  No one has ever brought up this myth before.  Shut up. 
[00:31:30]  Get hurt in the pants.  Jamie's like, oh, I know what we can do today.  There's a myth that a man can hold his breath with an ass on his face.  You're naughty.  You are naughty.  Isn't he bad?  But I'm just saying that's, you know...  Jimmy.  Sorry.  Do you think that kids are getting more into science these days as opposed to maybe 10  years ago because of the popularity of channels like Discovery and the Science Channel and  History and shows like Mythbusters and things like that?  I'm going to say yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I have a big impact on the world. 
[00:32:00]  Changing the face of the nation.  You know, I was a terrible student and I certainly wasn't interested in science.  I mean, I like science.  I wasn't interested in it up until...  I mean, you put on Discovery Channel 24 hours a day.  I know.  I wasn't interested in science until I heard you were in D.C. and I had to get a telescope.  DeRose is just mad because he got bumped off the big boy table.  I don't like it.  I'm back here like a fucking dog.  Have your macaroni and cheese back there. 
[00:32:30]  We made him get out of the big boy's seat.  You're in his table.  Danny made me move.  I feel bad.  This is how I know Danny's nervous because I've interviewed people that I was very nervous  interviewing, but I know Danny's like...  He's never like this.  He's asking questions and they're not moving.  So, do you think science was always popular?  We're out of time.  And then he just stops.  I knew he was nervous when he said shenanigans.  Yeah.  Pardon my French.  Not at all.  You've never watched an episode of Mythbusters?  Yes, I have.  I'm turning you in right now.  They did a great one about pulling two phone books apart. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was amazing.  Wait, you can swear here?  Yeah.  We're on Sirius, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you want to say?  It's the best.  That's why you can be on the radio.  Yes, I'm very good.  He's behaving, actually.  I'm a fan of yours.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I know you're naughty, so.  Thank you very much.  But you've seen him before?  Oh, well, you know, I saw you on the Louie show.  God damn it.  Now I want to kill Jim.  Why?  We hate when people come in here and know Jimmy. 
[00:33:30]  Why not?  Why?  We just don't like it.  Can't Carrie and I just get along and have a couple people that kind of get to know each  other?  What's wrong with that?  What did you call it?  Carrie?  Carrie.  Oh, okay.  As a kid, Carrie and I get along.  So you saw the trailer for one of the shows where they put the phone book together with  the pages, and now you've seen every episode?  No, Tanks had actually took to pull it apart.  I'm so trying to undermine this.  Oh, no, but Tanks had took to pull it apart.  It was actually very interesting.  I know.  That's true, Jimmy.  We've got a lot of fans checking in.  I just want to take one from Bill in Philly.  I don't want to talk to the fans right now. 
[00:34:00]  Hello, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Danny.  What's that?  Danny?  Yes, sir.  Jimmy's doing better than you.  What are you going to do?  Well, and Ant's trying real hard, too.  We're not trying to do anything.  Danny's asking very interesting.  You know, she's a lovely girl.  She's married as a kid.  She's beautiful, but I appreciate that she came here.  Let Danny ask a question.  Danny, it's your turn.  I'm being very childish.  Danny's asking good questions.  Let me set you.  Go ahead.  Can I...  You're going to cheat.  Can I have something from your personal belongings?  No. 
[00:34:30]  I might have a bottle of Purell you can have.  I'll have it.  Oh, there you go.  Let me use some of it before I leave.  After she uses it, exactly.  Yeah, but then it'll be worth more to him if you use it before you give it to him.  So that makes sense.  Those are great boots, by the way.  She has one of the sexiest boots.  They're like leg high, like middle of the...  Higher than the knee boots.  Yeah, describe them.  We didn't see them when she came in.  You didn't, but a lot of people out there listening didn't.  Screw the audience.  I'm trying to let paint a picture.  I'm a big fan of leather boots.  I love the lace-up ones that go up to your knees.  They protect you. 
[00:35:00]  They're the best.  I bet you Danny knows more about Mythbusters than Karen.  Oh, yeah.  We should do a little quiz real fast.  I guarantee it.  I don't even want to do a quiz.  Just because some of those things...  Oh, my God.  Think about it.  Can we do a quiz?  I did it seven years ago, and he probably has watched the episode five times.  I just did it five times.  And they rerun it all day long.  What were you doing seven years ago on a Monday in January?  You know?  Like, that's...  I was watching you on television.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way, Joe was right.  About what?  I hate to say it.  About the ball thing.  Yeah, it happens in the airtime. 
[00:35:30]  It was the beginning of the movie, supposedly.  Oh, who cares?  I never watched it.  Exactly.  But we beat the shit out of you for no reason.  And you took it and just...  I wanted you to doubt yourself.  What a surprise that I got tossed under the bus.  For something that was true.  So how has the internet changed your job?  Because it seems like you can check facts right away.  Is it totally different than when you started?  We guys seem a lot smarter than we are, because people ask questions and you can just punch  it up.  We could Google it.  And then there's things like this, like video conferencing things and stuff.  Are you video conferencing while you're talking to me? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like people...  Well, I'm not.  Not when I'm talking to you, but some guests, I never even look them in the face.  I just sit here and type how bad the guest was.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  None of the guests that are listening.  It wasn't you.  I'm going to have to check with my fans what you're doing right now.  Oh, believe me.  There's not a...  You could check everything.  There's not a peep on here.  Usually, though, I'm like, oh, my God, can we please wrap this up?  This guest sucks.  God, yeah, no, his name is DeRosa.  What did I do? 
[00:36:30]  They were getting this shellac and all this stuff.  You're not a cute redhead.  Exactly.  After O&A, it's live.  After Opie and Anthony live.  Opie and Anthony are long gone at this point.  But all the rest of us are still here.  I'm Sam Roberts, of course.  Roland's still here.  Danny, Travis, Erock.  Now, we just put up, by the way, before that, you heard Billy the Bassman, Bob Kelly's character.  Coke Logic made a fantastic animation of Billy the Bassman.  We just reposted it on Facebook.  So you can get to that at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[00:37:00]  The best part about hearing that Carrie Byron clip was not only could you hear Danny's infatuation with her, but you could hear that Jim doesn't know a thing about the show and only went to make people jealous.  Of course, Joe DeRosa was in studio that day, too.  I'm here, Sam.  I'm Joe DeRosa.  No.  Roland's in here.  I don't know why.  He's doing impressions.  Roland.  I'm Joe DeRosa, yes.  We got any big guests coming up this week?  Because I know we talked to Mark Zito a minute ago, and Selena Gomez was here today. 
[00:37:30]  Yes.  He got all excited about that.  Oh, he went rant to take a picture with her.  He did.  You saw him.  Yeah, because what I exactly, here's what I witnessed.  They go, I feel like you pitched with everybody who did the interview, and they go, I think we're done.  And Mark Zito goes, no, you're not.  One more.  Really?  Like, he was the quarterback of this whole thing, saying, no, no, no, wait a minute.  And who was she doing an interview with?  I forgot which channel is, though, but they were doing press pictures, and they go, I think we're done. 
[00:38:00]  You think it was the morning?  The morning mashup.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, no.  Well, I talked to him.  Is the mic on?  Yeah, it is.  We're live.  The morning mashup.  Oh, jeez.  What do we have coming up?  Because how come we didn't get Selena Gomez?  Really?  Yeah, I know.  You're right.  Well, there's some things.  We've got a reputation.  Yeah, some things in the works, but Joe Rogan, our good friend stopping by on Friday.  In studio?  In studio.  And he's bringing one of his friends, Chuck Liddell. 
[00:38:30]  Rolling.  Chuck Liddell and Joe Rogan in studio at the same time?  And then next week is Barack.  Is Barack Obama?  That's incredible.  Rolling.  I mean, can we get, is he doing pictures?  Only for Mark Zito.  Oh, man.  Is there any chance of us getting Kathie Lee and Hoda?  Uh, actually, there is a possibility.  How about once they hear this?  First of all, for some reason, I bring a big **** on the plane.  I wonder what that is.  And it's not too big because it fits if you just jam it. 
[00:39:00]  It fits.  No one fits.  You have to jam everybody else's ****.  I've seen you in action.  I politely say, whose **** is this?  And then they say, mine.  And I say, would you mind terribly if I just moved it from **** to ****?  They look at you with venom.  It's first come, first serve.  Okay, wait.  You're the last one on.  So when you get on, there's no room to put your **** in.  And you have a **** too.  And mine's hefty.  Needs room.  Here's the thing.  You learn a little discipline in life.  And you get rid of the **** that's in your ****. 
[00:39:30]  **** I need all the things in there.  Do we still get them?  Was that Jamie Kimmel?  Oh, Roland.  You think that was a rip-off?  Oh, no.  Oh, I thought we were playing stuff from Kimmel.  No, Roland.  That's from the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh.  I mean.  Oh, possibly.  Possibly.  Besides, who doesn't?  They do like cock.  Who's that?  Who does?  She's single.  She's out in the bars on the Upper West Side.  I know.  Roland, I don't think you know this for sure.  It is.  It's true.  No, I don't know that it's true. 
[00:40:00]  This is just Roland saying it.  It's factual.  I don't know that it's factual at all.  Sometimes Roland shoots off at the mouth.  We had Jon Jones on today.  How do you think?  I mean, his phone kept cutting off.  I know.  It's AT&T.  What can they do?  Do you panic when stuff like that happens because you're afraid Opie's hanging up on people?  I would at this point, but I had to run to the restroom pretty bad.  You did.  You were in the bathroom.  I was, yeah.  That's a big surprise.  Any parties in the future? 
[00:40:30]  There is one in the works.  Now other people are excited about parties, so we're all coming together to throw a bigger  one.  Somebody on Twitter reached out to me and asked maybe an ice cream social in the future.  That's rude.  Now I'm lactose intolerant.  Oh, I'm sorry about that, Roland.  Now, there was some Twitter controversy.  Grab Mikey Piff.  See if we can get Mikey Piff.  Mikey Piff.  Mikey Piff.  Come up.  Piff.  Come here.  Come here, Mikey Piff.  Mikey Piff.  He works for...  Hi guys.  How are you? 
[00:41:00]  How are you?  How are you?  Roland's doing impressions again.  How are you?  Mikey Piff.  Come on.  You're on the air, Mikey Piff.  Hi.  How are you?  He works for Hits 1.  He works with the morning mashup.  And Mark Zito.  Mikey Piff.  First of all, Selena Gomez had 10 people here with her today.  I don't know about 10.  It was a lot of people.  I think it was like 5.  It was more than 5.  It was definitely more than 5.  The rest were waiting for autographs and pictures.  In here?  Not there.  Oh.  Did she need that many people?  Do they all serve...  Tell me this. 
[00:41:30]  Do they all serve a function?  Yes, yes.  The thing is, you know what it is?  It's two separate things.  It's like half are record people.  Yeah.  And the other half are her personal people that handle film or TV stuff or anything else she's got going on.  And second question for you.  Roland has accused Mark Zito of spending all his free time with the morning mashup.  And then he came in today and said he was getting pictures with Selena Gomez.  Does Mark Zito spend all his free time with the mashup?  I'm not there during the show, so I can't speak for during the show.  But I see him like once a day. 
[00:42:00]  Okay.  I thought he was part of the mashup because in your office it says,  All Your Names, then the bottom says Mark Zito.  I don't think that's true, Roland.  Thank you, Mikey Piff.  Very diplomatic of you, but we still got to the bottom of it.  Oh, there was some...  Hang on.  Does Hoda like cock?  Don't...  You don't know that.  There was some...  Don't worry about it, Mikey Piff.  Don't even acknowledge.  Don't give him the time of day sometimes.  You should plug your Twitter at least for coming on.  Wait, what did he say?  Plug your Twitter since you came on.  At Mikey Piff.  Yes.  M-I-K-E-Y-P-I-F-F.  If you can't find him, just go to Mark Zito.  Stop talking about Mark Zito. 
[00:42:30]  No, it's not Roland.  There was a...  Thank you, Roland, for the pizza party, by the way.  Thank you, Piff and Roland.  There was some Twitter controversy over this clip.  A clip that Opie posted with Joe DeRosa.  I believe it was on Friday.  But this was the clip.  We got the very funny Joe DeRosa today.  What's that?  And Joe was at the taping of the Donald Trump roast.  That's going to be on Comedy Central very soon.  Yes.  And there's a lot of rumors.  It's not even a rumor anymore because it made the paper that... 
[00:43:00]  Seriously?  Now, that seriously was directed toward Joe DeRosa as he turned and looked at the ass of one of the employees of SiriusXM.  Uh, the girl who he was looking at saw the video and started tweeting, angrily tweeting Opie over the weekend, talking about how great her ass was.  Uh, the great Ron Bennington has entered the studio.  Did you see this video in question?  Well, oddly enough, I saw the one where, uh, Opie called Michelle Rodriguez avatar. 
[00:43:30]  And that's...  That was...  Avatar!  That was the same video.  Michelle Rodriguez didn't take offense, but this girl did, so...  I didn't notice that a girl got upset about it.  Yeah, because he was looking at her ass, and Opie responded with, come on.  Like, it's not a...  Well, that's, I guess, how she took it, so Opie wanted to make sure that he was on the record with this comment.  Opie, I hear there's some controversy in the Twitter world.  I'm so glad that you, uh, caught me before I got out of here today, Sam. 
[00:44:00]  Um, on Friday, I made a video with Joe DeRosa after the show, and we were talking about the situation bombing at the Donald Trump roast.  So I wanted to get his take on the whole thing.  And as I'm videotaping, I'm making a quick video.  He's so distracted by a girl walking by.  So I turn the camera, and you see the girl walking away from the camera, so obviously you see her butt.  Got to be very careful here because of human resources.  So then I turned back to Joe, and I went, seriously, Joe? 
[00:44:30]  What I meant by that, not that the ass was bad.  What I meant was, you can't focus on a lousy two, three-minute video.  You have to look at this girl's ass.  Like, his ADD was completely out of control.  That girl got a hold of me through the YouTube page and was really mad.  So I want to make it perfectly clear.  I wasn't saying, seriously, Joe, meaning that's a badass.  I was saying, seriously, Joe, you can't focus because your ADD is so bad.  Can you comment on the ass, or will HR not allow that?  I can't comment on that.  I've never had to sit down with human resources in all my years of doing radio, and I'm not going to start now, Sam. 
[00:45:00]  It's not pleasant.  What?  Sitting down with HR.  Oh, you scared me.  I thought you meant the ass.  I'm like, what's wrong with you?  So that was Obi clearing his name.  Well, while you're doing that, I went over and looked at what she wrote to him.  Yeah.  Did you see?  What was it?  She wrote, fuck you, Ginger, my ass is amazing.  And?  I don't think, I think now he's got the level if he goes back into human resources. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, that's, I mean, you can't call somebody Ginger, right?  Sam, she just tweeted again, is Mark Zito part of the morning mashup?  Roland was hoping to rat, that's why he's still sitting here.  He wanted to rat out Zito because the morning mashup got to interview Selena Gomez today,  and Mark Zito weaseled his way into a picture with Selena.  There was, actually, as I came in today, some young girl was sitting out there,  and Zito was watching her pictures being taken place, and I said to him, what are you doing?  Yeah.  And he says, oh, I'm waiting to get Spencer's thing. 
[00:46:00]  He's got a DVD for you, but it's got to be watermarked.  And I go, where's Spencer?  He's not even here.  He's not even in the lobby.  Stop doing your fucking work, and stop wearing your generic Sirius.  He's not dedicated to the Ron and Fez show.  No.  He's dedicated to a corporation.  I've never met anyone like that.  Well, he's trying to actually avoid being on the air because he wants to spend a little more time with management.  Exactly.  It's crazy.  For us, it's crazy because it's completely...  What DVD was it?  I don't know what it is. 
[00:46:30]  I call that a lie.  Now, you know that he also, his thing is to run errands, right?  No.  Yes, part of his thing twice a week is drop off these tickets, go to...  For...  For any of the bosses.  Oh, my God.  So, there's a thing of...  Oh, that's what...  That Liam mentioned that that used to be kind of...  They made Liam do it.  Yeah.  And so, Zito kind of...  Did he volunteer for it?  How is that?  Yes, he did.  But, like, we'll be having an after-show meeting, and he'll be like, hey, I got to get out of here. 
[00:47:00]  The pro...  You know, somebody from programming needs shirts.  Do you tell him, like, what do you do?  What do you work?  I go, this is not...  This is what...  Not what you get into this business for.  No, I mean, it's like...  It's like, I have to leave.  This is my job, but I have to go because I think it would help me get ahead.  See, the thing is, he's like the secret of my success, where he's changing clothes on the elevator...  Yeah.  ...so I can fit in with the suit.  And I'm like, that guy never trusts the suit.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  Except Zito's being blatantly obvious about everything.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's hanging in all those hot girls.  Well, what?  So, he...  I'm glad that you rat him out on this morning mash-up thing, too.  Roland loves to rat on Zito.  It's his favorite pastime.  It's got to be done.  And, you know, Rob Cross is always asking me, like, hey, doesn't he fit in with you guys?  It seems like, you know, blah, blah, blah.  And I go, why did you get him?  He goes, because he wears a wire.  I believe it.  I believe it. 
[00:48:00]  Well, we'll let you have your show.  Fuck you, Ginger.  My ass is amazing.  You can see Opie's video at our Facebook page, Facebook slash Opie and Anthony,  or I think he'll be retweeting it at Opie Radio.  I can't wait for you on here, too.  Where?  No.  You ramble?  People are telling him that you ramble?  I ramble.  Jesus Christ, could not Sam ramble on anymore during a 10 a.m. show?  I'm trying to talk to Ron Bennington.  That's actually Mark Zito's Twitter.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  This time came in before I got here.  Oh, damn it. 
[00:48:30]  Well, then, let's let Ron and Fez start.  This is it for After Opie and Anthony Live.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  On the virus. </pre>
