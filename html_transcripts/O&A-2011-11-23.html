<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the playing and subsequent mocking of a poorly recorded 1982 love ballad, "Dara," by the band Finster (possibly As Is), featuring Anthony Cumia on vocals and Joe Curry (keyboards) in studio.  The incredibly cheesy song, also featuring Mike Klotz (bass) and Louie Graziano (drums), prompted listener ridicule and extensive discussion about its creation and the band's history.  The conversation then veered wildly to Joe Rogan's martial arts instructional video, specifically his triangle choke and spinning back kick demonstration, which segued into a discussion of a Long Island child hospitalized with a bacterial infection possibly contracted from wrestling mats, leading to graphic descriptions of face herpes and other wrestling-related injuries, including a caller's anecdote about contracting herpes of the eye.  The segment concluded with Anthony Cumia recounting a past armed robbery at a McDonald's.

The show continued with a caller sharing a story about his uncle being shot during a home invasion, sparking a discussion on gun ownership and self-defense, with numerous callers recounting their own experiences with robberies and armed confrontations.  A retired NYPD officer, Charlie, joined the conversation, discussing the delay built into bank silent alarms to prevent hostage situations.

Next, the show hosted an in-studio interview with William H. Macy, promoting *Shameless*.  The conversation covered Macy's character, his drinking habits, the show's raunchy content, his experiences on *Fargo* and *Boogie Nights* (including a funny anecdote about a repeated line flub), the differences between the American and British versions of *Shameless*, and the challenges of network versus cable television.  Louis C.K. was mentioned as being present in the studio at this point.  The interview concluded with a discussion about the decline of Atlantic City's local businesses due to the rise of casinos and larger corporations, comparing this to the disappearance of video stores and bookstores.

Comedian Norm Macdonald then joined the show.  The discussion centered on the decline of local businesses due to corporate dominance (Starbucks, Abercrombie & Fitch, music stores, etc.), the loss of individuality in commerce, the pervasiveness of technology and its impact on privacy, and changes in the entertainment industry, particularly music distribution.  The conversation included anecdotes about the VHS vs. Betamax battle, the absurdity of large corporations losing money yet maintaining a presence, and the nostalgic appreciation for smaller, independent businesses.  Macdonald also shared personal experiences with gambling addiction, including a humorous anecdote about throwing $60,000 into the ocean.  The segment frequently used vulgar and offensive language. Macdonald's appearance concluded with his departure from the studio, alongside Norm and Colin.

Following Macdonald’s departure, Anthony Cumia recounted his recent two-week cruise vacation and disastrous flight home. He described his anger at blackjack dealers, needing to be restrained by his security guard, Keith (a cop), and witnessing a compulsive gambler (a former New York weatherman).  He detailed the frustrations of multiple flight delays and cancellations at JFK, mocking first-class amenities before describing his coach seat experience on a later flight.  He also recounted his efforts (including falsely identifying himself) to secure seats for himself, his parents, and Keith, and his experiences with the baggage handlers at LaGuardia.  He vividly described the turbulent flight home, highlighting the rough landing and passengers' applause.  The segment concluded with Cumia showing vacation pictures, contrasting the idyllic scenes with his harrowing return journey; Sam Roberts was mentioned as having shared a photo of Cumia in his first-class seat. Brock Lesnar was briefly mentioned as being present but did not participate.

A caller then described his luxurious Caribbean cruise on the Norwegian Epic, detailing the villa amenities, excursions (ATV riding, dolphin encounters – one described as “ghetto”), and onboard activities. He shared a humorous anecdote about a video of a dolphin attempting to interact with a woman's vagina.  The conversation then shifted to the caller's unconventional priest, Father Tim, who runs and does Krav Maga with him. They discussed Father Tim's unorthodox approach, his apparent lack of judgment, and whether he still experienced sexual urges.  The discussion touched upon faith, religious decisions, and the disparity between the luxurious resorts and the surrounding poverty.

The final segment featured one of the hosts discussing his experience attending St. Monica's Church, highlighting its inclusivity and contrasting it with his childhood church experiences. The conversation then moved to a hypothetical interview with a young priest, debating the appropriateness of asking personal questions, particularly concerning sexual urges and confessions. They discussed the potential ramifications for priests who deviate from expected behavior and the pressures within the Church hierarchy. The show concluded with its usual outro.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  Oh, my God.  What's going on?  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's stupid.  Something ridiculously loud and obnoxious.  I sound like the best of Dallas Syndrome records.  We're never going to make everybody happy.  So why do we have to now make more people not happy?  Oh, no.  It's stupid.  It's audio vomit.  If I may use the word duty.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  By the way, we do have a copy of a certain song that Joe Curry dropped off last night. 
[00:00:30]  I can't remember who it is.  It is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is probably.  I haven't said the name or anything.  It is probably one of the most embarrassing moments in band history.  How embarrassing?  I said I was going to disavow any knowledge or any involvement.  You wrote it, and I want you to fess up right now because I am just the vocalist.  You are the guitar player in this, and you wrote the damn song. 
[00:01:00]  Hey, come on.  You know what?  Bon Jovi was huge back then.  I think it was more like a very 80s sounding with a keyboard, and I think I tried to put a  little Duran Duran wine in my voice.  Now I just pour wine down my throat, trying to kill the pain.  It's good for you, Pop.  It's good for you, Pop.  What are you guys airing that piece of shit?  Right now.  Right now. 
[00:01:30]  Stay on the line if you can.  Right now.  I'm just going to lower you in the mix a little bit.  Yeah, try to stay quiet and listen.  Yeah, just stay.  Joe, I'm lowering it for a minute, but we'll go right back to you.  Oh, wait.  Joe, you have a setup for this song?  If I'm not there when you come back to me, you know why.  That's the setup.  That's the setup.  I guess the band was going for a love ballad.  Yeah, the setup for the song is, well, I was taking, real quick, I was taking flying  lessons out of MacArthur Airport.  There was the daughter of this flight instructor that I was absolutely smitten with, and that's 
[00:02:00]  pretty much what it is.  I wrote a song to impress her.  I'm coming down to a gig, so I wrote it in a pinch.  Did it work?  No.  And we moved on from it, but you actually talked to Paul McGinnis?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, I actually, yeah, we got...  Holy shit, I can't believe that one.  I'm a massive U2 fan, always have been, even though the last few have been a little rough 
[00:02:30]  a few years, but...  No, we had to get permission to play down in Orlando to play Disney World, and that was  the only way we could get it was by getting him to sign off on it.  Holy shit, that's awesome.  Congrats.  Yeah.  Back to the song.  Sorry.  Oh, boy.  That's just stuck in my head.  And now I want to preface.  Okay.  Again, I have to preface this, because you motherfuckers are going to take this in the context of,  you know, it was recorded yesterday.  More years have been in front of me after recording this song than were before me. 
[00:03:00]  Well, why don't we just say the year?  Doing this song.  What year is this?  This is in the 80s.  It's early 80s.  I was out of the army for like two years, so it had to be 82.  Wow.  Yeah, this is very early to mid-80s.  The sound was, that was what everybody was kind of doing.  We're talking 30 years.  Dude, this is the 30 years old.  We're talking Mubarak just went into office. 
[00:03:30]  We're talking Anwar Sadat was barely dead.  Right.  He was still warm.  Still warm.  I can hear it in Anthony's voice, because it sounds like he had no nuts.  I mean, his voice was noticeably higher back then.  Yeah, a little higher, although my range is better now.  What were you, like 25, 26?  Yeah, right.  I was a mere child.  And Joe wrote this song.  I sang it.  I believe Mike Klotz is playing bass. 
[00:04:00]  Mike Klotz on bass, Louie Graziano on the drums.  Is the drummer.  And plank foot, plank keyboard.  Joe Curry on the keyboards.  My brother is backup vocals.  And, of course, great guitar.  It has the obligatory guitar lead in this song, of course.  Harmonies.  And vocals that are so mushy.  And lyrics are so...  Douchey.  Douchey, mushy, lovey-dovey.  They do not reflect my feelings now, which I would write a song saying, suck my cock, 
[00:04:30]  you fucking whore.  That's what I would write now.  I hear a lot of excuses.  Let's just hear it.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's good.  I wanted to preface it first.  No, dude, I'm sure it's good.  What's the name of the song?  The name of the song is the name of the girl.  It is just called merely Dara.  Oh!  Ted Bundy didn't apologize this much.  He fucking played a thing.  And a cute...  It's the longest setup in the history of Bad Bits. 
[00:05:00]  By the way, a cute story.  Stand by for boiled shit.  We were playing a gig.  We were playing a gig, and there was kind of an altercation going on at the door by the  bouncer and some chick, and the chick is yelling like she wanted to get in, didn't want to  pay the cover charge, and she's causing a fucking problem.  And me and Joe Curry are standing around, and I was like, you know, what the fuck is  this bitch?  And he goes, oh, that's Dara. 
[00:05:30]  Okay.  So this sweet fucking, you know, love ballad is to a flaming cunt.  Oh, great.  Flaming.  They all are.  Oh, no.  Okay, hold on.  Dara.  From 1982.  I gotta cover up.  I can't.  I am literally covering my face now with my shirt, because I can't fucking watch or  look at anyone.  Joe, and Joe, what's the name of the band?  The name of the band was Finster.  No, I thought this was As Is. 
[00:06:00]  No, this was...  Oh, you know what?  You might be right, Anthony.  Right.  As Is with Z's, probably.  Yeah, of course.  Okay.  Of course.  As Is.  Why wouldn't it be?  All right.  Here's Dara from 1982 with Anthony on vocals.  Oh, no.  I'm not looking.  Uh, Joe, who's now a big, huge star on guitar.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It was off a tape.  It was off a cassette tape.  So, relax.  That's all right.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It doesn't really matter.  This is horrible.  Someone once told me, even in love's a game, I want you to worry, you never feel the same. 
[00:06:30]  It doesn't matter.  It entered before the start.  It took you to scatter the pieces of my broken heart.  Endless days turned into sleeveless nights.  I give you anything.  I tell you, baby, it ain't right. 
[00:07:00]  You feel rejected.  I saw you the way I do.  Did you pause it for one second?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, look.  Shut up.  There are endless nights.  We've all had them.  Your heart was broken.  Dara broke your heart.  I knew he wouldn't just let it play.  It was not bad.  Oh, God.  It was so gushy.  Why?  Disgustingly fucking generic garbage.  What can Andy sound like?  It's driving me nuts.  We need someone that knows their 80s shit. 
[00:07:30]  It's got a Boy George kind of a toy.  Mixed with shoving Jack the Lane's lifeless cock into a juicer.  Otto will be a comic.  It's at Foxwoods tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Foxwoods.com.  I'm literally sweating.  I'm sweating.  Why?  Are you still thinking about Dara and how she broke your heart?  You did.  I sweat.  You had endless nights.  Yeah.  Did you record that in a studio?  You should have been arrested for trespassing. 
[00:08:00]  People are asking if me and Joe were back-to-back singing the vocals.  Long hair?  You had the long hair?  I'll have the, you know.  But it's a mix between an 80s new wave band and kind of like, uh...  AIDS.  AIDS.  Thank you, Jenny.  They're calling you Aunt Laban. 
[00:08:30]  Aunt Laban coming in for Mike and Woodbridge.  Did you have a bandana tied around your mid-thigh hanging down?  And a couple tied around the mic stand?  Yeah, yeah.  I did have five multicolored pastel-colored belts.  Oh.  Each one a little looser than the next.  Oh, jeez.  Were you guys...  I swear I did.  Ew, they should have all been around your neck.  Are you guys...  Is Joe there?  People are complaining that they've just been ant-rolled. 
[00:09:00]  E-Rock's saying it sounds like Wham.  You have the photos.  You have the promo photos of that.  There's promo photos for as-is.  Oh, no.  Are there?  Send them in so Aunt could tweet them.  Oh, God.  You gotta tweet that shit, Aunt.  Oh, God.  So, did you write the lyrics while Joe oiled your butt?  Sounds a little like...  Were you guys hoping it would make a John Hughes movie?  Put it this way.  At the time, I never thought if we ever got radio play with this song, 
[00:09:30]  it would be like this right now.  I was really hoping for something a little better.  It's Hump X from Whack Bag Men Without Dignity coming in.  Anthony goes to Hollywood.  Someone just wrote Paul in PA.  You've got the touch.  You've got the power.  Dude, you were high.  Your heart was broken.  What are you going to do?  You sing about it.  That's what you do.  You write like a power ballad.  Steven S. from Bayshore,  A Suck of Seagulls. 
[00:10:00]  We were a little more old,  because I was getting into what happened with this man's journey.  Stop judging him.  Just give me something  Something to help me through the bad times  There's one thing  I've always needed you  Amnesty's turning to sleepless nights  I can do anything  Until you believe it right  Only hope and pray that  You will see 
[00:10:30]  I'm always a big call  Come on, baby, stay with me  Oh, Dara  Oh, Dara  Oh, Dara  Send your love about me  I'm sure we'd have a fine romance  Oh, Dara  Ew  He should have been singing  Oh, Daryl  Oh, Daryl  You look like Vincent  You look like Vincent  Vincent the Chin over there

No, I did  The fact that Jimmy said we should have been singing  Puckering  My asshole is puckering  The fact that Jimmy said we should have been singing  Oh, Daryl  Because this is so gay  Oh, man  It's fucking  But, you know, you wanted to save the last dance for you  Oh, Jesus  Who are you, fucking Tom Cruise  And Born in the Fourth  You ran in the rain to go to your prom?

[00:12:30]  This sounds like haircut 100  No  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do  Oh, Dara  Then what happened?  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba  Save the last dance for me  No, I don't think the last dance was being saved  What was it?  It was something about romance  Romance  What was it?  Yeah, yeah  What was it?

Yeah, yeah  Apparently that is the line  That's a good lyric  Dan S. in Toronto  Kaja  Kaja boo-boo  Kaja boo-boo  And then UCF Gavin in Orlando  Sounds like culture flub  What happens next time?

[00:14:00]  Time is the healer  Time is the healer  I thought I heard fate is the dealer  That  Can we rewind that? 
[00:14:30]  That couldn't have been what he said  No, James  I must have misheard that  Because time is the healer  You have to say what you said to Anthony  Hey, you wrote it, faggot  Wait, but fate  Hey, fate is a dealer  You said it  This is turning brother against brother  Wow  If your ears could fucking hang each other  They would  So you didn't have to hear this  Wait, let me hear that line again  I want to make sure

Oh, hopefully  Fucking getting an abortion  That's just  Having a miscarriage  No, she's probably  Walking out the door  Or she doesn't like you  She never liked you  Oh, yeah  So I'd be rejected  You could take this song  And put it to Steve Perry's  Oh, Sherry video  And it would fit perfectly  Ah, probably would  No, because they loved each other 
[00:17:00]  Maybe you're standing outside  Holding flowers in the rain  And they're wilted  While she closes the door  Someone says in the video  Dara's flying into a bridge abutment  In her plane  Maybe she's walking  With a Paula Poundstone-like  Pantsuit  To this 1982  And that's what  Chicks Warren videos  They're calling this song  Oh, Diarrhea  Let me go to Rick in El Paso  Rick  Yeah, just done  Docking  Docking

[00:28:30]  Oh shit  I can't even make fun of Chip  Why  I knew a girl named Dara  Yeah  You got that to fall back on now  Which is good  Which is nice  Well now  That's part of radio history  Now it's out there in the fucking ether  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show  Sirius XM  Did you see footage of Rogan teaching George St. Pierre?  Did I talk about that? 
[00:29:00]  Holy shit  He's fucking  He was teaching St. Pierre  How to throw like a spinning  Like his spinning back kick  Rogan is a fucking  Deadly fucking kicker man  You don't even want to fuck with that guy  Dude he's teaching St. Pierre on video  And doing it better  It's hysterical  That's pretty impressive  Yeah  A triangle choke  Is this what this is?  Okay there it is  It's where  The guy's on his back  Oh man  And his legs are locked around your  Your upper torso  And you're like you're  How would you describe that?  You're 
[00:29:30]  Right there  Holy shit  He uses his own arm  He uses the guy's own arm to choke him  Oh is that what's happening?  Yeah  He gets around  Look now he's pulling his own arm  It's  It's almost like a figure four  That's sick  And then you tap immediately with that  Of course  Oh yeah  You have to or else you wouldn't be able to  Yeah  You're gonna be out  Yeah the guy  Cause the guy  You're trapped  It's like  Your head and your arm  Are through between his legs 
[00:30:00]  And he's holding you there  I'm a terrible describer of things  Which is good for the radio  I gotta just say  There's such gayness  Thank you  I was just  I was about to say  You think  Any time  There's a lot of gayness  Any of these MMA guys  In the middle of a match or something  Go to themselves  Wow this is really gay  It's just  It's two men  Wrapped up  And swirmed together  In the smallest possible package  They could be in  They're touching every part  There's never a  Oops I'm sorry I touched you there  In that kind of fighting  They don't care  They're grabbing balls 
[00:30:30]  Assholes in the face  Speaking of grabbing balls  It's kind of a segue  But there's a story on Long Island  They got a kid with Mercer  Oh yeah  And he's got some like  Super strep throat thing  And he's in the hospital  On a ventilator  And the dumb news is like  They don't really know how  He got the Mercer  He's a wrestler  And you're like  Yeah  It's from the wrestling mats  You assholes  Those disgusting wrestling mats  That's how you get the Mercer  If you're fucking  Rolling around  Where someone else was  Rolling around all sweaty and shit 
[00:31:00]  You might get what  What they had  Do you know what you can get  You get fucking  And I found this out  You can get face herpes  From the fucking mat  Oh man  You have  These guys have to shower  Rogan said he uses  A special soap  He said  I forget what it's called  It's this really intense soap  He goes  After a shower  Just to be saved  He goes  I stand there for a minute  With this great soap on me  It's a petri dish  Those wrestling mats  Fucking horrified you  You get face herpes  Alright  You could get the Mercer  Obviously  Certainly could get  I don't know  A bit of the gay 
[00:31:30]  A bit of the gay  You get some of the gay  We've talked about this  I just couldn't do that  Wrestling in high school  I was one of those guys  I wanted to try all the sports  When I was growing up  But wrestling was one  I just  I just didn't feel comfortable with  Too close contact  With other gentlemen  Oh this is Rogan  Rogan  What  Wiping down his mat  Yeah he's got to wipe it down  Again you're walking  In someone else's sweat  Barefoot  But this is him doing  Is he kicking  Oh yeah  Yeah  Who's 
[00:32:00]  Who's mat is that  Is that his training area  No I don't know where that is  That might be  It might even be in Canada  I'm not sure where this was  Was filmed  In his basement  I don't want him  But Rogan is throwing ace  Imagine you're like  Look cause he puts his hands up  And you're like  Alright look  I'm gonna fight Rogan  I'm gonna  He has this  He's gonna try to punch me  And then he just spins around  And kicks you in the face  But he's kicking like  Chest level  It seems like that's  A horrible body blow  Jesus  That's unbelievable  And he's really teaching it to him 
[00:32:30]  Like St. Pierre is  And he's so fucking fast  He spins around  And gets that  You'd absolutely think  He was gonna punch you  And then a foot  Would be in your face  What I love about that  Is St. Pierre is  Videotaping like  He's seeing something  Really cool you know  Cause he wanted to learn it  He goes can I videotape this  So I can watch this  And learn how to do this  But Joe really knows  What he's doing  I would love to see  Rogan actually fight  Me too  I've tried to start with him  He pities me  Like I'm a drunk woman  Try to mix it up 
[00:33:00]  A little with him  He could get some damage done  Don't you think  Yeah  He's  Crazy  We went out  And he's just such a nice guy  To everybody  It's like  You'd have to really  I think  Push him  To get a fucking punch in the mouth  But if you did  It would be very unpleasant  I'm a big fan of the Rogan man  I'm a big  A huge fan of his comedy  It's a bummer  He doesn't come around enough  For me to check out  When I was hanging out in LA  And just to get to see him  At the comedy store  Just kind of working on shit  Yeah  Oh my god  It was great  Yeah he is great  It was great  Because this shit makes you think  I like when some of these guys 
[00:33:30]  Make you think  And laugh at the same time  Well he's like  A weird  You don't usually get  Like really really tough guys  That are like  Complete potheads  And thoughtful  He's a really odd combination  Of people  Rogan's like four different people  In one  Yeah really  Absolutely  It should just be one guy  That could kick your ass  Or smoke pot  Or one guy that smokes weed  Right  Or one guy that's funny  Right  Stand up comic  Or one guy that thinks  About a weird shit  And one guy that just sits there  And you know  That could be a physicist  Well that goes with the pot  Yeah yeah yeah  That goes with the pot  You're right  He's all three of them 
[00:34:00]  Yeah  That's a really hard combination  He's a renaissance man  Yeah  He's a renaissance ass  Hey Chuck what's up  Hi  What's happening boys  Hey  Hello  Hey  Yeah face herpes  Talk about some shit  That sucks ass  I had that shit in high school  Got it from the wrestling mats  Me and half my team  Were out for a while  Because that shit spread forever  And it stuck with me  Well it's forever  But uh  The herpes forever man  Wow  Oh yeah 
[00:34:30]  Totally  So where on your face  Would you outbreak sir  Sorry where on your face  Just your cheek  And your forehead  My forehead mostly  What  What is it  It's like whenever I'm in the sun  It would bust out real bad  It's  It's the  It's the low level herp  That I got  I don't know  Oh it's one  It's the cold sore herp thing  It's the low level one  That most of the  Fucking population has  Yeah  And I've had it  Since I was eight  Because some stupid aunt  Or somebody kissed me  When they had it  Yep  And I  It's been my fucking nightmare  My entire life  And you 
[00:35:00]  And you got it on a wrestling mat  Yeah man  And uh  I kinda always gotta be mindful  Like I gotta  Like douche myself  With SPF 100  Cause  The sun can cause breakouts  So to keep me from looking  Like a shithead all the time  I gotta really be aware  Oh  He's absolutely right though  Wow  It comes out in the sun  Mine is  Mine is the lip one  It's a fucking pain in the ass  I just heard about this  I just heard about this  I brought a weapon  With my ex-girlfriend  Because that stupid bitch  Got it from me  Sweating on her  While we were fucking  So ha  Joke's on her  It's extremely easy 
[00:35:30]  To pass along too  Extremely easy  And most of the population  Has it  You don't want the other one  No  The other one's the bad one  The sexually trained one  Yes  Number two  Yes  That can be a bear apparently  If people outbreak  But you got it from a wrestling mat  That's fucked up  Yeah  Oh yeah  Fucking  The nerve endings pop out  It's a nightmare  Does it look like herpes  On your forehead  I would never have thought  That was herpes  On someone's forehead  It looks like  It looks like a cold sore  It looks like dot herpes  Yeah  Ugh 
[00:36:00]  It actually like  It gets hard  And  Like you have to keep it  Covered with a band-aid  And  You put some shit on it  You know  The Virac or something  And it'll kind of like  Turn green  And scab off  But I mean  It's freaking gross man  Mm-hmm  All right  That sounds disgusting  Yeah  And you guys got it  From wrestling  Yeah  Totally  Yeah  I was  I just  Couldn't do the wrestling  No no  Ew  That was tough man  I'm glad I could bring up  The level of the show today guys 
[00:36:30]  No worries  Contribute  Yeah  But I just heard about this  When I was in Austin  And Joe  And I went out  With Kenny and Joe's buddy  To eat  It was like  He was just talking about  What we were eating  Fuck  I didn't know you could  See  You saw Rogan  He had towels  And all sorts of stuff  Yeah yeah  He knows how to keep his shit clean  Yeah  His mat's clean  Himself clean  He's got the soaps  I guess if you're in that world  You just understand it  You learn  I bet you most people  Get it in high school  And stuff  Before you know  Like when you're around  Guys that are professionally trained  Everybody knows  By that point  Yeah but when we were growing up 
[00:37:00]  We didn't have all these  Anti  These soaps  I'm still fucking tired  Anti-bacterial  I know the word  I'm just tired  We didn't have any of that  We had just one lousy bar of soap  That didn't even smell good  Yeah  That cleaned everything  But I want to know what that soap is  It's like a  It's a natural soap  It's supposed to be really  I'm always looking for a new soap  You want to talk to a guy  You like soaps  I do  You want to talk to a guy  Who has herpes on his neck  From wrestling 
[00:37:30]  Oh my god yeah  How did you know you could get this  And why is it just on your neck  Like wouldn't it just spread everywhere  That's a really good question  Because mine is just on my bottom lip  Oh  Which I don't get as much anymore  Because I don't  Believe it or not  You'll laugh when I say this  But I don't stress as much as I used to  Because stress brings it out big time  Do you take anything for it  The Valtrex  Also there's  The Valtrex when you do have a breakout  Knocks it down  And it keeps it way down your body  For a long time  Lysine is supposed to be good too  It's some kind of a natural amino acid 
[00:38:00]  I think  Yeah  I think lysine is supposed to be good  But I don't  I don't get as much  Thank God  But it  It concentrates on one area  For whatever reason  It just rushes back to the same spot  Maybe Dr. Steve could explain that  Well it's  It's herpetic  And  Let me  Yeah  Let me say hi to Garrett in Orlando  What do you got Garrett?  Hey  Yeah  Junior year of high school  Was basically weighing in  Getting ready to start a wrestling match  And this guy was just covered  Head to toe  In these tours 
[00:38:30]  And I  Wanted the medic to check him out  The medic checked him out  Cleared him  To wrestle  And  A couple weeks later  I started breaking out on my neck  So I went to the dermatologist  And  Dermatologist  Taking pictures  It's the worst thing he's ever seen  I've got herpes that break out on my neck  That cover my entire neck  That just  Seat and pus  And it's nasty  Anytime I go out in the sun  My life is ruined  So  Is it on the front of the neck  Like or the side 
[00:39:00]  Like whenever you bend your head  Basically right on your Adam's apple  It comes out real big  And just spreads out on both sides  And  And you get it in the same place every time  Every single time  I did not know that  Because I always wondered about the lip thing  I didn't know if you  Like the guy with the forehead  And now you with the neck  I had no idea  That is  That is horrible  It's horrible  It's right  It ruined my fucking life  So how often do you outbreak sir?  Probably like twice a year  Yeah  That's about right 
[00:39:30]  And it just completes me  You know  Shuts me down  I can't do anything  Do you do the  The Valtrex?  Yeah  I used to be on Samfear  And they changed it up  Samfear?  Master of the panic  Helps the herp  Yeah  You just crank up his music  And it goes away  And the herpes hides  It's terrible  I know  When you start talking about Valtrex  Everyone's starting to think out there  Oh fuck  Sexually transmitted  It's not  This is very different man  But the Valtrex definitely knocks it down  And it helps 
[00:40:00]  And it's brutal  Going to the  Going to CVS  Going to pick it up  You know  You look like  You're talking to a hot chick behind the counter  Picking up your Valtrex  Oh really?  You know what she's got?  Yeah  That's what you do  You go  What do you have?  Stop looking at me  What salve do you have?  AZT  Right  You never try to fuck the pharmacist  Unless you're only picking up Allegra D  That's  If you're picking up Nexium  You might be able to fuck her  But if you're picking up Valtrex  And Cialis  She's like  Do you never learn? 
[00:40:30]  They really do know everything about you  The pharmacist  Oh it's humiliating  Oh it's humiliating  You know what?  I went recently to a pharmacist  Pharmacists are dumb  I had my throat  I was coughing last week  So I got some antibiotics  Just to knock it out  It was something  And I go to pick it up  And my girl is kind of behind me  So I go  And she goes  Oh do you have the Z-Pak?  Which was for  It's an antibiotic  Strep throat and all that  Right  But it could also I think be for a VD 
[00:41:00]  It's like  The pharmacist  Oh right  I think  Yeah I think an antibiotic  Could be used for something else  I wouldn't doubt  And I'm thinking to myself  Like I don't care  Because it's strep  But shut the fuck up  Don't announce what I'm getting  Yeah  What's wrong with you?  Oh  What's the matter with you?  Unless it's  Are these your magnum condoms?  Then  What are you doing?  Like what a stupid woman  Fucking announcing it  I once ran into  You know what?  I'm going to shut up  It's such second nature to them  Oh what? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah I guess  I guess I  Who'd you run into?  I  Fuck  What's wrong with me?  An old co-worker or a friend?  I ran into an old co-worker  At a pharmacy  Who was  Who was  Sheepishly  Picking up something  At the  Pharmacist  And was like  Was like  Oh fuck  What are you doing here?  As I pick this up  I don't know what was in the bag  But his body language  Said a lot  Oh really?  That there was something  Was he walking like a  He had suppositories in? 
[00:42:00]  Do you have a small dog with him?  Oh no  Getting some soup  I'll shut up now  But it was one of those  Oh what are you doing here?  As the bag is kind of like  Going into a backpack  And well  I'll see you  See you tomorrow  Yeah you never know  God you never want people  To see what you get  At the pharmacy  It's just awkward  Yeah it really is  And you gotta say  Like you know  Your name  And then  And then  They go  Okay 
[00:42:30]  And then they  Blurt out the name  Of the prescription  And you're like  Oh yeah okay  That's good  Right  Hey um  We're talking about  You know the herpes  And you know how  We have to keep going  Until we have to tap out  It's Larry in Georgia  Larry go ahead buddy  Hey  Happy birthday Jimmy  Thank you Larry  First time through  Great  I've been listening for years  More information please  Same thing as Opie said  Evidently one of my son's aunts  Or something 
[00:43:00]  Kissed him near his eye  Or maybe on his hand  Or something  And he rubbed his eye  Now he's had herpes of the eye  I always wondered about this  Herpes of the eye  We've heard this over the years  Here and there  Yeah  Is that possible?  Yeah  This guy's saying it huh?  Oh yeah  What does that mean?  He's on battle track  It's the same time  The other guy said  Anytime sunlight hits his eyes  He just doesn't shine man  Well the good news is  Your eyes don't really hit sunlight ever  So  Jesus  Danny 
[00:43:30]  Yeah our house looks like a dungeon  How old is he?  He's 12  And what does it look like?  Is it around the eye?  No  You really can't even see anything  You know by looking at him  His eyes look fine  But anytime the sunlight  Or a bright light hits his eyes  He just starts crying man  I mean  There's some that are on the  Outside of the eye  But then there's some that are actually  On the eyeball itself  Alright thank you  And you can get a  Herpetic infection 
[00:44:00]  On the eye itself  Alright what would you take?  Herpes of the eye or the dick?  Wow  Jesus Jimmy  I ask that to every date  And they say  I have both so  No that's not what they say  Uh oh  Well I guess  I'm gonna get both  I guess you could hide  The herpes of the dick  So I might have to go dick  Yeah wow  Who wants to walk around  With a herpes sore around their eye?  And your eyes you use for everything  Yeah but  The big reveal  True  The big reveal 
[00:44:30]  If you're like  Hi look at this  Hey suck on my  Chopped meat  Yeah but it wasn't  It wasn't  It was a tough question  It wasn't like  Would you rather have  Herpes of the eye  Or an ice cream sundae?  I'd go with the sundae  Oh  I thought you were asking  Of course  Both answers  Are gonna be rough  Yes  You want another one?  Jerome in Florida  And then  He's got the herp of the eye  I need to learn more  About the herp of the eye  Jimmy  The line tree  Hello 
[00:45:00]  Hey what's up guys  Hey Jerome  Yeah I got it  When I was about 12  I'm 28 now  And really  When I was younger  It just  It's like a cloud  Like a white cloud  Kind of covering  Covering my vision  It disappeared  Into a cloud  Yeah exactly  And it happened  When my uncle  He dropped a beer bottle  It cracked  It cracked the cornea  In my eye  And then I took a flight  Across the country  And I guess  Whatever bacteria 
[00:45:30]  Got in my eye  Happened  And I was in the hospital  For like three weeks  I'm never leaving my house  And I took medication  And basically  Whenever I'm sick  My body's weak  It just goes straight  To my eye  Can't see very well  And then  You know  I get better  And it's fine  I don't take anything now  I don't take anything now  Because now I'm like  I don't have any reactions  But I also used to get  On my face  Because of it  And on my lips  So  Herpes?  It's pretty fucking annoying  Yeah  Wait a minute 
[00:46:00]  You think that all came  From a dropped beer bottle?  No stupid  It came from me flying  From what?  He said that  I guess his cornea  Was caught or whatever  Injured so  And then  You know  It left it open  For bacteria  From the airplane  To get in  But that's how  You wouldn't get herpes  That way sir  Well I've had  That's how  They said  Jerome  He probably went  Into the bathroom  And then rubbed  His eye  Jerome  With fucking  What happened?  What Dominican  Sat on your face?  Oh  You got a little  Bukkake  In that cut 
[00:46:30]  In your eye  Didn't you?  Where were you  When the hooker  Sat on your face  With her dirty ass?  But he thought  It was a good idea  Because you were  Still a virgin  Wait  How old were you?  I'd say  I was probably  12 or 13  I might be  A little too young  I think someone's  Mind made it  A beer bottle  But I think  Something else  Might have  Gotten rubbed  On his uncle's  Beer bottle  Was it?  No no no  Would he shake it  Up in your face  A lot?  No  That beer bottle 
[00:47:00]  You know  Would it have  Two little cozies?  Two cozies  Was it a long neck?  Ah yes  Let's do beard jokes  Yeah was there  A little piece of skin  That went up  Over the top?  You came to the right place  For the sympathy  Yes sir  We apologize  Exactly  Alright Jerome  Bye  You're listening to  The worst of  Opie and Anthony  It's the worst of  The Opie and Anthony  Show  Sirius XM 
[00:47:30]  I understand  Why a guy  Robs a bank  I really  Even though it's  A terrible crime  But if you rob a bank  And don't kill anybody  You're gonna do  25 years anyway  Yeah  So you might as well  Kill somebody  So you might as well  Shoot your way out  Absolutely  You might as well  Shoot your way out  Well  That's why they  That's why they have  Yeah that's why  A lot of times  They do go shooting  Because they know  They're going for  The rest of their lives  And why would you  Ever look at the robber  Fuck that  Would you take a peek  When you're on the floor?  Uh no  I would just look 
[00:48:00]  Straight down at the floor  That's actually  Why would you ever look  That's  Always the wrong move  In every  Fucking bank robber  I would have to  Take a peek though  You would take a peek  See if his back is turned  And then just blast  The back of his head out  Well you got a gun  No you already  They already checked you  For shit  And you're on the floor  Check me  Guy ain't checking me  For nothing  I see  They usually come in  And go  On the floor  No  Most bank robber  Is just some guy  That goes up to the window  No one knows  The bank's being robbed  Until he's out 
[00:48:30]  It's not like the movies  Why would you be the dummy  That pushes the button  It's not my money  I'm not moving  You see how they rob that bank  In the town  They just burst through the door  And just start smashing faces  That's how you gotta do it  Yeah  But why would you be the teller  That has to nervously  Try to go for the button  Fuck that  You're not paying me enough  No fuck that  I'm not going for the button  I was in an armed robbery  And I did look down  And I told my girlfriend  At the time  Look down  Really?  Oh yeah  Years ago  What happened?  I was in McDonald's 
[00:49:00]  Many years ago  In North Brunswick  And the girl I was dating  Her name was Tina  At the time  I'm getting chills  Seriously  That just gave me  Fucking chills  We're sitting facing  This was McDonald's  In North Brunswick  And it faces out  Like  We were sitting at the counter  Looking out of the parking lot  And Tina and I  Are sitting  It might be 9 at night  It was late  And I see the left  There was two entrances  One to the left  And then the front entrance  Which is to my right  And I see  Three guys coming in  Uh oh  Or two guys coming in 
[00:49:30]  Wearing parkas  Yeah  Ski parkas  And it was August  And I immediately  Oh shit  It was a problem  So the one guy comes in  I forget what he said  But he's got a pistol  And the one guy comes over  And he grabs me  And my girlfriend  Did he say oogily boogily  Yes  You got grabbed by these guys  Yeah but not  How many people were in the  McDonald's  Not that many  Maybe 12  It was late  But they grabbed you  Out of everybody  No no no no  They were just trying to get 
[00:50:00]  Everybody to the front of the store  Okay  So they grabbed me and Tina  He just corralled us  Right  But she fell getting up  And he said  Come on come on come on  And I was like  They're going to rape her  In the back  I was really scared about that  Oh man  So we walk up to the front  And I was holding  A couple hundred dollars  Of her money  This was like  I mean this is probably  1988 or 89  Before I did Santa  Wow  And I remember  The one black woman  Ran out the front door  Who worked there  And there was somebody  Corraling people from the front  So we were all up at the front  And I had my hands up  And I was like  I just told Tina 
[00:50:30]  Look down  Don't look at him  Do not look at the guy  Look at the floor  Look at the floor  And we could hear the guy  In the back screaming  Open the safe  Open the safe  He's screaming  And his pistol I actually saw  Wow  I was nervous  And the guy  But the guy we were talking  Who was out with us  Goes  We're not going to hurt you  No one's going to get hurt  But then you get scared  They're just going to  Take your girlfriend  They're going to  It's like  It was fucking horrifying  Holy shit  I never told that story  No  And we're just standing  Looking down at the floor  I remember this  We're looking down at the floor  It's been a bunch of years  But  Yeah  But that was my first instinct 
[00:51:00]  Was do not look at them  Because you don't want to  You just want to be  A piece of the furniture  Right  If you just stand there  Looking down  You don't want to make  That eye contact  And the guy goes  Oh fuck  Now he could possibly  You know  Pick me out of a lineup  Or something  Fuck that  Did you feel violated  What do you think  No  I almost gave them  The money in my pocket  But they didn't  They didn't rob us  They did not rob the people  They only robbed the store  But did you feel  Like what  After it was over  What happened  I was scared  When the cops came  I didn't see anything  I was just so scared 
[00:51:30]  Because a gun had been  It's like you know  Again  Now I would just tell them  I mean I did tell them  What happened  But in that moment  You're in shock  You know  You just had a gunpoint  It's scary  It's fucking scary  Fucked up  But violated  Hard to say  Because they didn't rob me  Like the guy didn't  Even the guy  She just happened to fall  When he was corralling us up  Yeah he didn't rob you  But they made  They made you do something  That you did not want to do  They scared us a lot  But  It was  It was a pure store robbery  In the sense that 
[00:52:00]  Even the guy who was out with us  You know  He was robbing the store  But he wasn't abusive to us  He wasn't shitty to us  You know what I mean  I knew it  Like  There was nothing  Personal with us  We were just  Window dressing  Just stay here  And shut the fuck up  And everything's fine  This has nothing to do with you  And it didn't  It would be great  If your chick was like  Why don't you people  Get a job  Great  I would have raped her  Great  Right  But that is what I was scared of  Is that they were going to grab her  On the way out the door  So you never know  Yeah let's take this  And then the relief  When they were gone 
[00:52:30]  Tremendous relief  Of course  But they ran right out  But then hearing that guy  Yell in the back  I mean he's going to kill that guy  That's got to be very scary  When you're being forced  To open a safe  Open the safe  Motherfucker  Yeah I don't remember  What he was yelling  But he was really fucking yelling  I would forget the combination  Oh dude  It would just leave my mind  Boy that really is one of those things  Where it's like  Don't fuck it up  Yeah it was very scary  But again there was three guys  Like Hamilton  Trying to open the safe  Open the fucking safe  Laying motherfucker  You don't know how many had guns  Even if I had a gun 
[00:53:00]  I don't know if I would have pulled it  Because  Yeah when you got more people  There was three guys  That's rough  It was like what are you going to do  Blast them all  And risk getting other people shot  That would have been a tough call  Yeah that is  That's one of those calls  Where it's like  Just stand here and  Just be prepared  But don't do anything  Yeah that's a situation  Where you gotta  You gotta roll with them  Cause there was a guy in the back  Who would have been shot  If you start hearing gunfire  That's different  Then you gotta start  You know  Self-preservation mode  But yeah  You can't endanger  There's not  A situation 
[00:53:30]  If you  If you're legally  Allowed to carry a gun  Concealed  It doesn't mean  Every time something happens  You pull it out  And start fucking shooting  Because  You could definitely  Fuck the situation  Well you can get yourself killed  Because there was a guy  Behind us  And the guy  It was like  They weren't all  In your sight line  Yeah yeah  That was  They were literally  Those guys  Were just watching the doors  They just wanted  They wanted to get out of there too  Right  Wow  How long did it take  For the cops to show up after  A couple of minutes  I mean the North Brunswick  Police Department  Was literally  A half mile down the street 
[00:54:00]  Wow  Those guys are probably  From New Brunswick  From the projects  Or from Franklin  Which was not that far  Were they African American gentlemen  They're black guys  Yeah they definitely were  Yes  Yeah but that's  I didn't say that  I thought I said  They were running  They were three  Black guys  They ever  Catch them  I don't know  To be honest with you  I mean that's so many  Years ago  I don't know  Wow  That's fucking harrowing  Yeah  That was fucking scary  Alright here we go  Brendan in South Carolina  Brendan  Morning boys  Hey  Good morning 
[00:54:30]  Good  Similar story to Jimmy  I was actually  My first field job  And walked into a bank  I hadn't made a deposit  Because I was bartending  On the weekends  To get some extra cash  I probably had  I don't know  1500 bucks  Two grand  And was making a deposit  Into the bank  And you know  Kind of chatting up  The teller  And had an  You know  Kind of elbow  Leaning up on the counter  Looked left  And saw this guy  Walking into the bank  And I was like  Wow he's dressed  Oddly warm for July  And he propped the door  Open with a little  Little footstep thing 
[00:55:00]  And walked right in  With a ski mask  Handed a note  Right over the counter  With gloves on  I realized what was happening  And kind of put my hands  Right on the counter  Where I could see  He was a little bit  Shorter than I  He showed the butt  Of his gun  And his waistband  And you know  30 seconds later  He was walking out  Of the bank  With a bag full of cash  Yeah it's the best  Way to do it  Yeah yeah  Just fucking  You know  Don't get involved  With it  Especially if they're  Fucking  Most times  I'm assuming  I'm sure there's  Those sociopaths  Who want to hurt somebody 
[00:55:30]  But I really think  Most people  Just doing a store robbery  Like that  With a lot of people  In it  Or a bank  Just want to get  The fuck out  It's also  The late night ones  Where a store's  Closing up  And the employees  Are there  That's a dangerous  Situation  Because a lot of times  They're just like  Well all we gotta do  Is kill these  Motherfuckers  And no witnesses  More importantly  More importantly  Did you get to eat  Your happy meal  I don't remember  I said  Don't take my  McNuggets  You black  Son of a bitch  I really white  Guided up on him  Or you just 
[00:56:00]  Throw a McNugget  At the back of his head  Here eat this  Chicken lover  Things you can do  That will get you shot  Oh wow  Let's say hi  To Scrambler  In Chicago  Scrambler  Scrambler  Morning boys  Yesterday my uncle  Was a gentleman  Rang his doorbell  Dressed in snowmobile gear  You know the coats  The bibs  And ski masks  And I asked if he had  Any gas  Or snowmobile ran out  Oh yeah  You tweeted this 
[00:56:30]  Last night right  Yeah  Yeah I read that one  And I talked to him  He called me  Before surgery  I talked to him  Real quick  And I talked to him  Right after he got  Out of surgery yesterday  And so he said  You know the shed's  Over there  Help yourself  With some gas  And then one was black  One was white  He could tell  Through the mats  And so then they  Ranged the doorbell  A little bit later  And they got into  I don't know what  Happened to lead  To the tussle  But he said he  You know kind of  Got into it  With one of them  Because he knew 
[00:57:00]  That something  Was going to happen  And then he got  Like you know  One of them  Hit him over the head  With the gun  And they shot him  And one shot  At each of his  Inner thighs  And they missed  Everything  No arteries or anything  One went in and out  And the other one  Was lodged in  And so we had  To go to  You know obviously  When they left  He called 911  He crawled upstairs  Grabbed his 380  Crawled back downstairs  And waited for the 
[00:57:30]  You know the police  To get there  And he was  Four hours later  He came out of surgery  And talking to me  On the phone  He wasn't  It seemed like  He was alright  For a guy  He just got shot twice  Jesus Christ  That does make  Anthony look less  Nuts for having  His gun on him  Because your uncle  Had a gun  I mean it's like  You do have to  Have it on you  I guess  Because people  Don't wait for you  To run upstairs  I don't answer  The door without one  Like if I see  Somebody knocking  On my door  And stuff  I'm like  Who the fuck  Is this  Alright  But then I just  I smile  And open the door  Hi how are you 
[00:58:00]  What do you need  What do you want  I do that too  I make  You know  If somebody's  Coming like  A service guy  Or something  I always make  Sure I got it  On the hip  And you know  I open it  You know  And that's  The first thing  They see  But I don't  You know  You don't talk  About it  But you make  Sure that  The first thing  They see  Is the  You know  The grips  Hanging out of  Your waistband  Or sticking out  Of your holster  And you know  Yeah just let them  Let them  Let them know  No shenanigans  See what you  Have to do  Is you got to  Be subtle about 
[00:58:30]  When you go  Hi sorry  For the delay  I was just  Buffing my bullets  Buffing your bullets  Yes whatever  It is gun people do  I don't know  Do you ever buff bullets  I was washing my gun  I was washing the bullets  You don't wash your gun  No  No no  How about you say  Sorry  I had my bullets  On tumble dry  I was removing them  And putting them  In my gun  Well we're glad  He's doing well  There sir  Wow that's  That's a hell of a story  You got scrambled 
[00:59:00]  Yeah exactly  People are just brazen  Brazen  There's home invasions  Wisconsin  The only other state  Besides Illinois  That doesn't have  A legal carry law  They do have a loophole  Where you can open carry  But you can't have it  On you in your car  Or in a restaurant  So it's kind of worthless  But it is the only other state  Besides Illinois  No concealed carry law  Wow  Alright  That's something  There you go  Damn  Alright sir  Have a good morning boys  You too 
[00:59:30]  Let's go to Nate in Delaware  Nate  Hey morning boys  Morning Nate  When I was in college  My uh  I got a phone call  And I got a call  From my dad  Saying my mom  Was robbed at gunpoint  While manning  Their car  A family owned business  Uh  She was 40  Nine months pregnant  And uh  The black gentleman  He came in  Showed her the gun  Uh  Asked her to get on her knees  Tied her up  And my mom just  Said please  Don't kill me  I'm pregnant  And he said 
[01:00:00]  I'm not gonna hurt you ma'am  He stole a car  Hundred dollars in cash  Dumped the car  About five miles down the road  And they never found him  Your mom got very lucky  Wow  When you said he pulled her  On her knees  I was like  This story's about to get great  I was like  Oh  Great  Oh my god  She laughs about it now  You know  She tells the story  And she had no fear  It was just  It was amazing  God  Probably look at life  Differently right  I bet she thought  She was getting  Fucking back of the head  Let's say hi to Robert 
[01:00:30]  In Wisconsin  Robert  Hey there bab  Couple more of these  We'll move on  What's up Robert  Hey what's up guys  When I was 19  I was a manager  At Wendy's  And uh  Two guys came in  With shotguns  With steam ass on  I thought it was  Just my friends  Fucking with me  So I kept pushing  The shotgun away  Until he smashed me  In the face  Oh god  Yeah and then  I was like  Oh fuck  This is real  And then they took me back  And I'm trying to  Open the safe  While there was  Fucking blood  Coming down my face  And shit  I'm like  Oh man  I was all fucked up  Why would you  Assume it's your friend  Exactly 
[01:01:00]  Oh you silly gooses  I just  I didn't think  It was real  I was just  Too young  And stupid  I was just like  I don't know  It just didn't seem  Real to me  It would be a  Great prank  To pull on your friends  If you knew  No one else was around  But  Yeah exactly  But fuck  Hop comes in  And blows your head off  Exactly  Just standing there  With a gun  Wow  All right man  Let's say hi to  Charlie in Staten Island  He's retired NYPD  What's up Charlie  Charlie  Yeah OB  On the silent alarm  They got a delay 
[01:01:30]  On the button  It's like three  To five minutes  So that gives the time  For the robber  To get out  So there's no hostages  Hostages taken  Wow look at that  Did they really do that  Yeah there's a delay  That's a long five minutes  For everybody  I know  What if they're abusing people  And hurting them  I don't know  But I guess  They don't want  Hostage situation  Kind of like  Dog the afternoon  Right  Okay that makes sense  Logically I guess  It makes sense  Unless you're in that situation  Because you would  Hope someone comes immediately  If you push that button 
[01:02:00]  Yeah  You need help immediately  But why  Charlie I gotta call you out  On this  Okay  Alright so there's a delay  Because they don't want  A hostage situation  But why wouldn't  There be no delay  But the NYPD  Allows five minutes  You know what I mean  So you know exactly  When the button was pushed  No it goes through  The system somehow  When they push the button  It goes automatically  But the delay is on  NYPD's end  The dispatch  End of it  Oh  Well that seems like 
[01:02:30]  Could be a lawsuit  Yeah I think that  They probably  They probably wait  I think they wait  Five minutes before  They enter the bank  Because they probably  Walk  You could probably  Walk outside  And the cops  Are waiting for you  I don't see a five minute delay  What if they're murdering people  What if they're in there  Spray painting  Graffiti  Or whatever they do  Guy who just goes off point  I don't know why they do it  But I know that it's  What if they're in there  Turning the chairs upside down  And throwing the pens all over  Then what happens  And ripping the calendars up  Putting the deposit slips 
[01:03:00]  Where the withdrawal slips go  Yeah what if they're doing  That using all the ink  In the pens  Then what do we do  Go ahead  Your turn  See you later  All right Charlie  He's had it with us  Yeah just  Oh a little beep beep beep  But don't  Don't be the person  Trying to push the button  No  Don't do that  No heroes  No heroes  Because you know  The company doesn't care  In the end  They're not going to give you  A big fucking bonus  If you survive  No  The bank robbery  And save them money  I would be a hero  And I would stand up 
[01:03:30]  And I would tell them  I'm not standing for this  And I would point at the table  I'm  I'm a hero  You think that would cause problems  For my teeth yes  One  One fucking gun butt to the gums  That must have been something  Just seeing  Young Jimmy Norton  With his head down  Don't look  Don't look at him  Don't look at him  Were you able to communicate  Anything to your chick  While this was going on  Yeah you were saying  I just said just  I just quiet  I just looked down  Do not look up at them  Don't look  What'd you say motherfucker  I said  What'd you say  I said  What do we expect 
[01:04:00]  From you people  This is what we expect  This is why  Gentrification  It was on a long  45 minute discussion  About gentrification  It's a debate  I'm not gonna debate you Jimmy  This isn't a debate  What's that from?  Fargo  Oh yeah  That's okay  You're listening  To the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony show  Sirius XM  We have William H. Macy outside  And he only has a few minutes  So how are we gonna do this? 
[01:04:30]  Triple you  You wanna stick around?  What do you wanna do?  Sure I'll hang  Alright  You know William H. Macy?  Yeah  Yeah  I thought you were talking  To Patrice  Get him in here  William H. Macy  How are you sir?  Hello sir  Alright  We got a full house today  Yeah I know  Triple H from the WWE  You got Patrice O'Neal  Very funny comic  Bill Burr  Very funny comic  Anthony  God damn  How you doing  What a head of hair on you  Jesus  Pleasure to meet you sir 
[01:05:00]  He's dressed just like  The other show  Yeah yeah  Yep  That's definitely  I would assume that  That is hair for the role  I would assume that's hair for the role  For shameless  But that's good that you can  Grow a head of hair like that  Jesus  I don't doubt it  Damn I can't grow hair like that  That's the best part of being an actor  No matter how you look  You can say  No it's just for a role  Yeah it's for a role  Yeah it's good  The reason I'm so toasted in the morning is for research  Research  I was reading something 
[01:05:30]  Obviously your character on Shameless  Drinks  Yeah drinks a little bit  A little bit  A little bit  Now you stopped drinking  Volume  Yeah turn up his volume  Someone roadie that mic  Iraq help him out  Help out William H. Macy  Shouldn't have to do that himself  He's a big star  Well  Yeah his character drinks a little bit  Yeah  Yes  I've been known to drink a bit myself 
[01:06:00]  I'm taking a little bit of a break for it  It turns out I like drinking a whole lot  Yeah  Yes  Like  Because I was reading that  You kind of stopped  And you're  What are you a scotch man  I do like scotch  I like a good scotch  You can tell by the color of my hair  Yeah  It seems to do the follicles well  Every once in a while I think it's a good idea  I've suddenly realized  I have a limited number of brain cells left  And perhaps I should marshal my forces  Just kind of  Twilight of my  Twilight  Well you seem to be able to work 
[01:06:30]  You know  So it must not be out of control  What was the first part?  Well no  He's able to work  He's done  He's done a great body of work  I mean it's not like it's getting in the way  Well it's great to play a character  That's lit up all the time  I mean  For the first time in my life  Sometimes I'll hold the line  So I can make more faces  I'm not kidding  Yeah  It's a great thing  Frank the guy I play  Is a drinking alcoholic  He's an addict  He'll take anything  So every single scene is just 
[01:07:00]  There's no wrong possible in that role  Are you going to get up off the floor and act?  Because I'm early and shameless  The first couple episodes  You don't see William H  No  Well you see  He's on the floor sleeping  And I'm like  It's his show  When is he going to start acting?  It's a contractual thing  I said I want to get a lot of rest in the highlight  No I bring that up  Because everyone says  No it becomes  You know  You're way more in it  A lot more  But I'm only two episodes in  And so far 
[01:07:30]  You know  The rest of the characters  Went to Canada  Yeah  The rest of the characters  Are holding their own certainly  And then William H Macy  Shows up to sleep on the floor  That's so far what I've seen  My entrance into the series  Yes  Unconscious  Yes  Mumbling  You know you've made the big time  When you can sleep and get paid for the bill  That is the ticket right there  Yeah is that what made you sign on  You're like  Alright I get to sleep for the first three episodes  Totally chill  We're just beating him up  He's a great actor obviously  Shameless is based on a British show 
[01:08:00]  I did not know this  It's a great series too  Same title  Yeah  And we've got some of the same people working on ours  The creator  I think Paul has been helping with us  And the guy that directed their pilot  Directed our pilot  It's at once the same  And completely different  Right  It's an American version  And I believe  Like  Like the office  It's a  It's a successful transfer  Yeah  Are you glad it's  Not on a network  That you're able to 
[01:08:30]  Really go  Go the full distance  Because  Sometimes shows seem like  They have so much potential  But they put them on a network  And it's like  Ah come on  I want to hear realistic speech  I want to hear some real language  It's a double-edged sword  On one hand  On the networks  You make the serious money  Because they  Do so many more  But you're right  Having written for television  A good bit  It's tough  You can have no language  No  No drinking  For the most part  Yeah  I once wrote a thing  Where a 14-year-old girl  Was smoking a cigarette  They said 
[01:09:00]  You're joking  Right  Yeah  Yeah  That's right  Wouldn't even consider it  Like it never happens  Yeah  14-year-olds  There's something about  Just taking reality  Out of network television  I know  Which is  Not only can people  Not smoke cigarettes  But if they do smoke cigarettes  They better die  You know  This  This shameless  They're smart too  It opens up with  William H. Macy's  Teenage  Is she a teenager  She probably did  In her early 20s  I guess  Run in the household  Just walking around  Trying to get everyone ready  Because you know  He's irresponsible 
[01:09:30]  He's drunk somewhere  And she's walking around  The house  In just a t-shirt  No bra  And I'm like  Okay  I can handle this show  Very smart  Emmy Rossum  And then she's naked  By the end of the first episode  With the guy from the club  Having sex on the floor  I should warn you already  That you're going to see me naked  I was going to bring that up  That's the one episode I saw  My girl was like  Yeah William H. Macy's in this  You know I love this guy  And then I see your ass  And I'm just like  Jesus Christ  It beats working  I thought it was bad enough  In his box  He was trying to get out 
[01:10:00]  That window  In the hotel  That was great  Okay  Alright  We're trying to hold back  We're all huge farters  I know who isn't  Huge farters  Great line in that  He's heard it a thousand times  You say  Mr. Smith  They go  Who?  Who?  Who?  Just every  What a  Just a catastrophe  Of screw ups  On that character's part  Which is just  What a brilliant character  It's like a  A despicable  Yet such a sympathetic  Character  And I think  You've pulled that off 
[01:10:30]  So well over the years  In a lot of the  Characters you've played  Not that it's a  Typecasting or anything  But like the  The other one  What was the one  Boogie Nights  Yeah Boogie Nights  Is another prime example  Of just  This poor son of a bitch  Yeah  Like oh my god  Well it turns out  If you can do that well  You can have two homes  Yeah  Apparently  God bless you  Did he just nicely say  I'm fucking rich  Yeah  Good guy  I like that  I gotta practice  Doing shit like that 
[01:11:00]  I think that's what he said  You just say it  In a matter of fact way  I sympathize my way  To two homes my friend  In the cooler  You were able to take  That whole kind of  You know loserish character  But that was a leading role  For you  And it kind of  It turned around  During that movie  Where you turned into  More of a  A winner  Well  Are you a method actor  By the way  Are you like  When you work in  Are you like  A drunk guy  And I can't  Like when the guy  Says cut  You're not like  Hey so I like life 
[01:11:30]  Are you like still  Fucking  Drunk guy  Like were you Fargo  The whole time  When you was in Fargo  Fargo  No no  I don't do that  And actors who do  That are really  Boring to do  Tell a joke  Or something  I know  It's just acting  You don't have to  Don't take yourself  So seriously  To me  I made a few  Movies here  And there's so much  Waiting around  You would be  Off camera  More in that character  Than you would be  On camera  I never understood that  I can't have fun 
[01:12:00]  I have to stay  In this character  I'm a serial killer  And it doesn't help  Doesn't help in the end  No it's exhausting  And it doesn't help  It just annoys the crew  They probably want a human being there  To deal with  And the most important fact is  You can still have two homes  Without it  Yeah see  It seems to have worked  I gotta ask you something  Something we were all curious about  In Boogie Nights  A line you said  Whether it was a flub or not  She has an ass in her cock  That's right  Was that a flub  I did take one  I said it correctly 
[01:12:30]  Take two  Paul Anderson said  You said  Ass in her cock  I said  I did  I'm so sorry  Take three  I did it right  Take four  I did it again  He said  You did it again  I said I didn't  I swear to you  I didn't  So  It ended up in the film  There was some  There was some  Hidden truth in it  I guess  Well a cock  A cock is a pussy  Like it's a  It's a street length  Since when  Yeah  Who you been talking to  I'm saying  I'm telling you  Pimp talk  A cock  Is a twat 
[01:13:00]  As the official brother  Of the room  Yes  I'm just telling you  That's why he kept it  White people are gonna pick up  On this in two years  I think it was more like  That's a two year buffer period  We gotta go through  As white people  To pick up on black vernacular  So William H. Mason  Was ahead of his time  In that fucking movie  He was trying to help you out  William  That would be something  That character would have done  Is like screw up  Yeah just so frustrated  In that moment  That you're screwing up  I think that that was  Probably  More of the anger  They were going for  There Patrice  Were you ever afraid  Even though the characters 
[01:13:30]  Though they had similarities  Were a lot different  Were you ever afraid  Of becoming typecast  As like here's  This guy  You know this  Poor sap  Kind of guy  Really  Sure  Still am  Are you really  Well yeah  If you do something  Well in Hollywood  They'll certainly ask you  To do it again  Do it again  Right  Well this role  The cooler is a good example  I turned that film down  About three times  I thought  I gotta call a moratorium  On this loser character  Right  That I'm doing  But it was too good  To turn down  That's why I like  Frank Gallagher  The character I'm playing now 
[01:14:00]  He's  He may  He's certainly a loser  But he's got a lot of power to him  Yeah  Yeah it's not the pathetic  Being stepped on  Not at all  Not at all  That you usually play  I realize we haven't even  Really explained Shameless  In your own words  What's the show about  It's tough  I play Frank Gallagher  The addicted alcoholic parent  Of six kids  They make their way  Through the world  As best they can  Hilarity ensues  Trying to get guidance 
[01:14:30]  I'm on board  I'm gonna watch  Sounds good  I gotta say  It's great  It really is a great show  I don't like anything  And I particularly  Usually don't like the stuff  I'm in  This is fantastic  So was that your reaction  When you first got  Offered the project  I mean  Because I would think  That you just have  A stack of scripts  Outside your door  Every day  I'm glad you think that  No that doesn't happen  Really?  What level do you have  To get to?  Two doors  Two doors Bill  Two doors on both coasts  Right  I think there are about  Four actors in the world  That have the choice  Of anything they want to do  I'm not one of them 
[01:15:00]  I  No I liked it immediately  I read the script  By John Wells  It was a fantastic script  And then I saw the series  The British series  When I was sold  Oh wow  Do you have trouble  Changing the character  A little to adapt to you  When you see  A series that  Is being adapted  From a British series  I would think  It's kind of hard  Not to try to  Almost do an impression  Of the guy  Well I stopped watching  It was  Oh you did  It was good enough  That I realized  I better not watch it  I did that with trailers  Now because movie trailers  Give away too much information  So if I have an on demand movie 
[01:15:30]  And I'm like  I'm not sure if I want to see that  And I hit the trailer  I'm like  Okay good enough  I'm watching it  Like two seconds in  They show you all the way up  To the resolution  Of the third act  Yeah I don't need to see that  I don't know why they do that  It's terrible  The best one ever  Was Speed 2  When they actually showed them  Getting off of the boat  And running around the island  So it just killed the whole suspense  Of how are we going to stop the boat  It's like well  Obviously they stop it somehow  They figured it out  Right  That was another thing with  What was that Tom Hanks  On the island movie there  Castaway  Castaway 
[01:16:00]  During the trailer  I mean they show him  Back home  And trying to get into  This relationship  With his ex-girlfriend  It was like well  They show the oil tanker  Picking him up  And I didn't know  He gets off the island  And the whole thing  That he's going to kill himself  Or something  Or live there forever  Right  It just  Trailers  They really have just destroyed  Movie watching  And they don't destroy  The neighbor will  Is there a Hollywood  Yeah that's true  Is there a Hollywood stigma  To doing TV 
[01:16:30]  After you're doing movies  Your whole career  Do they look at you like  Like I can't help it  But I look at  Christian  What's his name there  Slater  Slater  Slater like  Uh oh  Like  Like  Like I'm saying  But is Hollywood  Look at it like  Oh shit  William H is doing  Oh  He's on Showtime  Could be  Definitely there used to be  But  Used to yeah  In all honesty  I gotta say right now  I think the best stuff  Being done anywhere  Is being done on television  Yep  I gotta agree with you  I see the  The little indies  That come out 
[01:17:00]  Every once in a while  There's one that's great  There's a  A film or two each year  That comes out that's great  But the  Most challenging stuff  The best stuff  Is on television  And I think you're seeing  A lot more actors  Uh  With reputable careers  Yeah  Uh going to  Especially the cable outlets  And uh  Things like that  Uh  And putting out some good stuff  You know  Buscemi  Steve Buscemi  He's fantastic  Going to his show  Yeah  Uh  Boardwalk Empire  Also  I really  Like to act  I like to do it  Yeah  A lot 
[01:17:30]  And when you do a TV show  You get to act a lot  And as you were saying  When you do a feature  You get to sit around  And wait a lot  Yeah  So there's not a whole lot  Of working involved  Sometimes  Another person on  Instant feedback  Going look  William H. Macy  Isn't in the show  But he's telling us  That he's going to be  In the show a lot more  This guy's two episodes in  Yeah  Saying that Macy's  Just kind of laying around  So far  You'll see more of me  Than you want to  I like the fact that  You know what else is good  About this time we're living in  Is on demand  And being able to  Look at some of these shows 
[01:18:00]  On Showtime  Without having to  Be there  And watch it live  I mean  It's a lot more convenient  I know  Have you gone back  And tried to watch television  Where you have to sit  Through the commercials  It really is infuriating  They're louder  There's more television  Than there is programming  Yeah  And then I like  When the local spot  Jumps in  And the sound  Is so bad  Because it's like  Some local car dealership  I know  That they went to  I just love that  They thought if they  Made it louder 
[01:18:30]  That would like  Commercials were already  Annoying  Let's  You know  Let's badger them  With that  I've heard they actually  Do things now  You know  Because of TiVo  You don't get credit  As far as like ratings  Like TiVo doesn't count  Because they know  People fast forward  And they have this thing  Now if you fast forward  These advertisers  They have like ways  Of like when you fast forward  They'll still have  Their products  So you still kind of  See it  On some level  It's really  Gotten to a psycho level  That's why  You know  Hey show time  Gotta love it  Yeah subscribe  Pay for it  You don't have to 
[01:19:00]  Yeah  Because you  You're not dealing  With commercials  You get the whole show  It's not like  You're getting 20 minutes  Of programming  And 20 minutes  Of commercial  Hate that too  I know  Our show's 55 minutes long  My wife's on a TV show  And hers is sometimes  42 minutes  Is an hour  Yeah  Yeah  Who's your wife?  Felicity Huffman  She's on Desperate Housewives  Yeah  Of course  Felicity's delicious  Would you have got that  Without Shameless  You think?  I don't know  I think Fargo got him that one 
[01:19:30]  Yeah Fargo  Yeah Fargo maybe  You picked the wrong show  Come on  We're all out of our leagues  We all know it  Just stop  Doesn't hurt to be married  Oh that's great man  Jesus Christ  She's also on Sunday night too  We just barely missed  Oh really?  With each other  That's good that that didn't happen  Yeah that would probably cause some  That would be another show idea  There you go  Some friction  Right  And I guess no haircut in the future  Well  You gotta live with that 
[01:20:00]  You gotta live with that  I might do an indie  I got a couple of films  We're on our hiatus right now  So it remains to be seen  I'm sure they can make a wig out of that  Like  I don't know  A fucking shameless wig  That looks pretty authentic  He's keeping the hair  Waiting to see if there's another season  No he said he's gonna do a movie  He's not playing around  He's keeping the hair for Shameless  We're gonna do another season  They haven't picked it up yet  Do you  It's obvious  Are you always acting?  Do you take time off or something?  Yeah  Much more than I wish  Really?  Sure 
[01:20:30]  Yeah  But Felicity Huffman being on a popular show  You can take some time off  There's nothing wrong with  Digging in her pockets  Hey  That's true man  Fall in love with a rich girl  Y'all get divorced  She's gonna fucking get you  Bad mother  Take her money now  Save it and give it back to her  After the divorce  I live in California man  It's our money  That is true  Brutal  Wouldn't wish that on anybody  Believe me 
[01:21:00]  Yeah  Went through it  Went through that  Years ago  And oh boy  You've been free for a little while now  Took a while  Yeah  Many years  He's been free for  No I mean free from the  The check writer  Oh from having to write that check  Yeah  From the check writer  Can I ask a Fargo question sir?  Sure  I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers  I love the Coen brothers  Is their process  Like  Are they cool?  Are they  Are they  Weird guys?  Or like  Is it  Is it a fun thing?  Or is it a  A really 
[01:21:30]  Professional thing  You know  Like I don't  You know what I mean?  Are they cool?  Yes  Yes  Yes  And yes  They're weirdos  They are  Sort of  Film geeks  They've seen every film ever made  They are exquisitely prepared  They're very fun  To be on the set with  It's about  It's about the best working experience  You could have  They're not  They're not mentioned  When people talk about  Great filmmakers  Man  I think they're  They make fantastic 
[01:22:00]  I mean  People start talking  They'll be  They'll talk  Martin Scorsese  They'll talk  She's a Spielberg  You  You don't hear  The Coen brothers  You do  To people who love movies  But you don't  I mean  I think they're  Under the radar  Still  The Coen brothers  And they make great films  Miller's Crossing is  One of the best  Gangsta movies ever made  True Grit was fantastic  Yeah  Oh yeah  I think their place in history  Is assured  I thought it looked great  Patrice now 
[01:22:30]  Not so much  But I'm never gonna get  I love them  And I need you to do me a favor sir  Is to  Let them know  That I don't  Remember any black  God damn characters  That's all I need you to do  Is just say sirs  Coen brothers  I remember  I remember Fargo  I remember  Miller's Crossing  Every great  Little  There's no black people  In Fargo  No I'm saying  I'm saying  It's just nothing  I'm in the city  It means Fargo  Just 
[01:23:00]  But I'm saying  Put one in  The Coen brothers  Are into realism  So they're gonna do Fargo  They put a Chinese guy  In fucking Fargo  There's Chinese food  Everywhere  There's Chinese restaurants  Everywhere  I got sushi in Nebraska  It's hard to love  Love the Coen brothers  Like I do  And there's just  No black characters  In there  They've never pushed one  They're playing the percentage  I mean  They fucking put over  Harvey Air  Bardum  This foreign guy  They put him over  Just put one black character over  That's all I'm saying  Patrice O'Neal  I'm not even saying me 
[01:23:30]  I don't know if I can pull it off  But they're great  That's what I'm saying  It's hard to stay focused  That's all  You ever see them  You ever see them get upset  With each other on the set  Anything like that  No  It's gotta be hard to work together  One's kind of in charge though  Like  It's never directed by them  It's like directed by one of them  And then the other one's like  The writer  Or something  Ethan writes more  And Joel directs more  But they both do both  I mean  They're both on set  They're amazing man  They're damn amazing  And one of them's married to 
[01:24:00]  The star of Fargo  Frances McDormand  McDormand is amazing  Yeah  What a great incestuous business  I love this business  I think they made movies  Before they got married though  Ah  They said it again  They were making films together  Before  Oh Frances McDormand  Right  Back in  But Fargo is her big  Her big one though right  She won an Oscar  What is your favorite role  You ever did  Like  Just like  You go man  I  You felt good  After you did that one  It's like naming  Your favorite child  You can't quite do that 
[01:24:30]  But I did a little film  Called Happy Texas  That I just adored  Nobody ever saw it  But I liked it  There's a mammoth film  Called State in Maine  I had a great time in that  I did one of the Jurassic Parks  That was  Yes  Yes  Oh you did one of the  I'm sorry  Holy fuckballs  They were just running out of dinosaurs  How about we invent one  With a fucking  That has a smiley face  And a hat  And it's  We're trying to make friends 
[01:25:00]  With this guy  No I'm saying  He knows  God damn knows  What was your favorite  Like  I want to go back  To Happy Texas actually  Because you said  You liked that film  Why didn't anyone see it  I don't know  Is it a film that people  Should have saw  Yeah  It's great  You can rent it  It's out there  But is it  Was it a marketing issue  Was the subject matter  Maybe not for the mainstream  No I think a marketing issue  And so  You know you can make  A great film  That no one wants to see  Right 
[01:25:30]  I don't think anybody's  Have you seen a movie  That had the word  Happy in it  I will say  I don't know  If there's any  Happy Gilmore  Happy Gilmore  Come on man  That's not fair  I mean like  Because happy  In serious movies  Is always  Turns into  Something very  Weird  Like  Can you tell  By the way  Can you tell  After you've made a movie  When you see the marketing  Can you tell at this point  Going oh god  They're not marketing this right  This is going to tank  Can you tell  As you're sitting at home 
[01:26:00]  If you're excited about a movie  And you're watching the advertising  And just the way they're marked  Like did you know  As they were marketing  Happy Texas  Like they're doing this all wrong  You know  It took me a long time  To get to this  But the people that do marketing  Do have a talent  Right  They're good at it  In the history of film  No director  Has ever said  I love the way  They're releasing my film  It's just never happened  Okay  Everyone's  But  Yeah  I've seen it  Where I thought they  The marketing people  Tried to sell it 
[01:26:30]  As something that it's not  And that never works  Well my point is  That it's got to be  Frustrating for you  You know the movie  Happy Texas  Is a really good film  And then you see other films  That everyone's seen  And you know  It's a piece of crap  I know  Film  That's got to be  Just infuriating  As an actor  For a while  The independent film market  Was a viable market  Right  People see it  But now that's  Because of the new technology  That's a mess  We have to unfortunately  Wrap up  But shameless  I've got to acknowledge  Joan Cusack  Is in this film  Joan Cusack 
[01:27:00]  She's an amazing actress  She's still cutie pie  And I'm being reminded  Because my girl's way ahead  And shameless  I'm two episodes in  And she's all in  And there's a scene  Coming up with you  And Joan Cusack  Yeah  And a very large dildo sir  Very large  This is how I want to end  The interview  Oh jeez  And Showtime by the way  Is making a real big push  Like to challenge  For the dominance  Of this whole  Well they're doing great  Yeah but there's  There's a scene  Coming up there  William 
[01:27:30]  Oh there's a couple of scenes  Wait till you see  How this thing ends  William H. Mason  Takes it in the poop shoot  In fucking Showtime  Someone's got an ass  On their cock  Yams it up the booster  But it's from Joan Cusack  Wearing the big dildo  I know  This is how crazy  This show is  I knew her  When she was a young teen girl  I babysat her  I saw you do an interview  Where you discussed that  That's right  Thanks for reminding me  Wow  What Joan Cusack  He babysitted Joan Cusack  And now she's giving it to you  With a dildo  Cusack  Cusack  What's her name? 
[01:28:00]  Q  Q  Cusack  You lucky I remember  Some of these white people's names  You lucky he's not  William J. Macy  Motherfucker  Give me a fucking break  I know who she is  But used to babysit Joan Cusack  Yeah I am  She's a weird player  Now she's yamming  Some of his geesters  That's right  That's fucking hilarious  And I'm hearing it's a  I'm hearing it's a very  That's hilarious  I'm hearing it's a very  Large dildo  Oh god 
[01:28:30]  But this show  Shameless  I'm telling you  It's one of the best shows  To come around  In a long time  Sundays 10pm  On Showtime  On Showtime  God damn  What can you say  William J. Macy  We've quoted you  A thousand times  On and off the air  Oh good  Okay  Okay  Oh jeez  It's my deal  That whole  That whole time  The anger  With the ice scraper  I was just going to say  One of the best emotional scenes  Without a word being spoken  Starts out just  Yeah I gotta scrape my 
[01:29:00]  I'm not getting the fucking money  Like it's just perfectly done  It's a great film  It goes all the way through the anger  To then just  The way you swing it  The sadness  Oh  You've heard it a thousand times  Absolutely brilliant  I'm sure you've heard it a thousand times  When you're sitting  On that bench  In front of the door  Answering your son  About what's going on  And the dead father's in the trunk  And you're just like  Okay  Yeah  No no  Everything's fine  I'm gonna go to bed  Yeah  I'm gonna go to bed  Hope it all goes away 
[01:29:30]  It's so tragic  The guy's trying to get  He's trying to get the numbers  Off the burnt Sienna  Whatever  And he's just saying  Okay  Okay  No I can't read the numbers  Yeah alright  Okay  I'll fax him  No no I mean message him  Oh shit  Isn't amazing  It's great writing  That's even going  Not great writing  There's not a weak character  It's great acting  That's not like improvising  Any of that  No no no  I couldn't imagine  Anyone else  Playing that though  It's  Phenomenal  You do such a great job  That that character  Just comes right off  The screen at you 
[01:30:00]  It's  You do such a  Perfect job  Playing that  I feel like it's a comedy  Poor motherfucker  Is there a story sir  Of you  Of how you got that movie  Is there  Like isn't it a  There's a  Either somebody  Turned it down  You got it  Or you fought really hard  To get it  I fought hard  I was a work a day actor  I went in to read  For a smaller role  And they said  Do you want to read  Jerry  And I said yeah  So I went out  Into the other room  Worked on it  They said that's real good  You want to come in tomorrow  And I said yes  So I was up all night 
[01:30:30]  Every actor I know  Was at my house  Running the lines with me  I went in the next day  And I read again  And because I knew  I knew  Not only was it a great script  And it was the Coen brothers  But it was my role  Yeah  I could just see  It was written for a  Portly bald guy  Really?  So it didn't work that way  But I knew it was mine  You were such a great  Like car salesman  And then they went  To New York  Did you feel  After you did the audition  Did you walk out  Going I nailed that  I got that  I did nail it  And then I found out  That they were  In New York auditioning 
[01:31:00]  So I got my skinny  Lutheran ass  On an airplane  And it's not  An apocryphal story  I walked in and I said  I'm scared you're  Going to screw this up  By giving the role  To somebody else  I read again  Wow  And I said  I'll shoot your dog  If you give this role  Because Ethan has a dog  Yeah  Isn't that amazing  I earned it  Yeah I read it  It was like  It was bigger than  The average  Like you read  And got it  It was like  They had somebody else  And he just 
[01:31:30]  Would not let them go  Yeah  One more quick thing  Was there ever  Any story  That you even heard  From the Coen brothers  As to why  The character  Needed that money  No  Never  Okay so that was  Never resolved  And it's not important  I've always felt  Everything you need  Is on the page  Yeah yeah  Back story has never  I think the character  Itself  You realize  He must have  Screwed something up  Sure  And needed the money  When was the last time  You saw the movie  Like we could put it  On tomorrow  And enjoy it again  Easily  A couple of years 
[01:32:00]  I'll be perfectly honest  I was watching it  Last night  Last night  Yeah  Absolutely  It's got insane  Rewatchability  It really does  And I'm telling you  I mean Shameless  Is a great show  I haven't had this much fun  In a long time  It's a great show  The characters  And the situations  It's unbelievable  Let's get him out of here  Before we get in trouble  Yeah  Thank you boys  Yeah thank you  And you gotta say it though  You gotta say it  As he leaves  Oh yeah  He's fleeing the interview  He's fleeing the interview  He's fleeing the interview  Yes  He's fleeing the interview 
[01:32:30]  Why don't you go talk  To old Bill Diehl  Oh he's fleeing the interview  And a story  The great William H. Macy  Gonna get a quick picture  And we'll be back  We got Louis C.K. in the studio  The Borgata Hotel and Casino  In Atlantic City  That's a great gig for Louis  And man you should go see him  Obviously  I saw Louis  Oh we talked about it 
[01:33:00]  The last time you were in  At Carnegie Hall  What an amazing show  Thanks man  Just an amazing show  Yeah it's perfect for it  It's such a cool  Perfect for it  It's the only place  In Atlantic City  That's  It really is like Vegas  Kind of  It's got that Vegas vibe  It doesn't feel like  Like I stayed in another hotel  Right on the boardwalk once  And I  It felt like I stepped  Into the 70s  And it feels like  You're in Atlantic City  Yeah yeah  You know you're in Atlantic City  Right  The Borgata could trick you  Into thinking  Man I took a fucking flight  To Vegas  I went to Vegas  That's exactly the difference 
[01:33:30]  Yeah  There's some old diner waitress  Bringing the drinks  At this other casino  Bringing the drinks  To the table  And you're just like  Oh and then you look  At the Borgata babes  And shit  Walking around  They're just stunning  No the Atlantic  The other Atlantic City places  It's like you're faced  With the economy  You're hurting  With everything you do  There's supposed to be  More of a buffer there  Yeah yeah  Where you can get lost in it  But Atlantic City  The dealer looks at you like  Thanks for fucking up  My hometown asshole  Would you like another card  Like they just look depressed 
[01:34:00]  God damn  That is it  You know  Yeah yeah  My father owned a house  And now I live in a fucking shack  Right  So that you could play blackjack  Hope you're having fun  Yeah  Oh look blackjack  I would hit on that  Yes  You so see the corruption  All you have to do  Is just drive around  A little bit  Less than a mile  From those beautiful casinos  And you realize  They don't give a fuck  About the local economy  No  It's all being sucked out  It's like  I don't know where that money's going  It's another kind of tick  But it's a remote 
[01:34:30]  It's like  It doesn't even spread nearby  No  It's like a scientific  Taking money  It's like a tick  That has a long distance sucker  Yeah  They must have helicopters at night  That literally  Lifted up into the sky  To make sure it does not touch  Even touch the local economy  Anybody there  And the politicians  They obviously just look the other way  Yeah  It's like they  You're not even gonna throw a dollar  Into the economy  No  Who are you talking about  Yeah  What are you trying to say  What are you trying to say  What are you trying to say  Who are you saying  Is doing this 
[01:35:00]  What what what what  You're right  Yeah exactly  We're already in  In a weird spot  With Donald Rumsfeld  I bet he knows  Where that money goes  You know what  I think Atlantic City's beautiful  Every inch of it is beautiful  The Borgata  It's fantastic  Go see Louis  Jobs  They got jobs  They got jobs  Jobs everywhere  Jobs  Jobs  Jobs  Jobs  How many people they employ  Jobs  There weren't those jobs  When it was  No  Before the casinos  No  There was just a really  Kind of a nice area  Steel pier  What the hell happened 
[01:35:30]  Where someone could actually  Open a store  And try to have a business  Instead of a job  But now they got jobs  They get to wear a vest  And deal cards  To fucking assholes  And Gaddafis  Yeah Gaddafis  Oh that's great  Jobs  Jobs  You mean people used to open up  Their own family business  Down there  Yeah  Bakery  Delicatessen  Yeah wherever the fucking  Wherever the Trump  Down there is  Does he have one down there  Oh he's got the Taj  And the Marina  I don't know how much  Yeah the Trump Marina  Is sitting where some guy 
[01:36:00]  Used to have an old fish restaurant  From he had the restaurant  From 1850  In his family  And now it's a fucking  Trump Marina hotel  It's right there on the water  I worked that fucking place  Or is it Trump Castle  It was called  I don't know where that is now  Yeah I think they changed the name  At some point  I did  I worked at Trump Castle  And I remember  Just watching people  I had never really been  Down there before  And I'm just watching  These fucking old ladies  From around the country  Come on buses  Like from the middle of Ohio 
[01:36:30]  Or Kentucky  Literally  Like you see a bus  That says like  Lexington, Kentucky  And they fuck  And these fucking old women  Come out of the bus  And they took a medical hit  From the trip  Like you just see them  And they get out of these  Fucking buses  They were in for hours  Days  Yeah  Blood just clotting  In their legs  Helping each  You know  The 60 year olds 
[01:37:00]  Helping the 70 year olds  Off the bus  And they go get  Shit rooms  Yeah  And then they pour  Buckets of fucking coins  All of their  Fucking retirement  All they got left  They just pour it  In buckets  Into these machines  And then they leave  Leave  And then  So I'm watching all this  And it all says  Trump all over it  And I never  And then I was in an elevator  And Trump got on  With Marla Maples  At the time  Okay  And everyone was like  Oh there they are  They were really excited  They saw them  Oh my god  There's Trump 
[01:37:30]  And the woman  He's fucking illicitly  And they get on the elevator  And Trump looked miserable  I was in the elevator  Alone with him  Just by chance  And he just looked miserable  He looked so unhappy  Yeah  And all that money  I realize there's a weird  Like he has all this  Billions of dollars  But he's fucking miserable  Because he needs  A hundred billion  To look in the mirror  And not want to kill himself  He needs that  These old ladies  From Kentucky  They don't need anything 
[01:38:00]  They have like  Maybe a thousand dollars  In the bank  Right  It's like they're coming  It's like a religion  Like they're coming  To help him feel better  Like they're coming  To give him money  Giving him the money  He's like  I have a hundred billion dollars  And I don't fucking  Fuck everybody  It's not enough  And these old ladies  Are like  I have maybe a thousand  You can have all of it  I'll give you all of it  I'll take a bus  All day to give it to you  We could have pumped it  Into our own economy  Where we live  Yeah I could have  Given it to my neighbor's store  That closed last week  But I figured  I'd come all this way  Just to dump it 
[01:38:30]  Into this machine  Hopefully make you  A little happier  Yeah  That's classic  Yeah with the only buffer  Being this vague hope  That I might leave  Yeah that I may be  One of the trillions  But it ain't gonna happen  So it was just  Poor  Poor money  I want to know more  About the family fish business  The little restaurant  That poor guy  That's forget that  With his little boat  He would just go out  Every day  Bait shop on the pier  He used to wipe off  The table when you walked in  And he'd feel real proud  Nice 
[01:39:00]  You'd smell like  The ocean air  It was open windows  In the summer  What was his last day like  You think  Wrecking ball  A bunch of suits  Wrecking ball  With the whole family  Just outside crying  Yeah  And now in that exact same spot  It's  Ring ring ring  Ring ring ring  Ring ring  Oh god  That's all  It was  It was Donald Trump  And a bunch of other guys  In suits  With golden shovels  Taking that photo  Of them breaking ground 
[01:39:30]  And in back  Is the boarded up fish place  Just ready to be  Plowed asunder  That was there for  150 years  You know  It's not  The fault of some  Corporations  Or Donald Trump  It's like  Walmart kills  All small town economists  But it's not  Walmart's fault  It's the fault  Of the fucking people  I used to have  A house upstate  In upstate New York  And there was  There was a town  That held these  Beautiful old  Diners and general stores  And they all closed  One by one 
[01:40:00]  Because of Walmart  But it wasn't  Fucking Walmart's fault  It was the people  That lived in that town  That don't give a shit  About their neighbors  But is it giving a shit  American basic consumer  Who's like  Well okay  I could spend  I could spend  Thirteen cents less  On a mop  Yeah  So fuck my fucking neighbor  Fuck my neighbor  Who's had that store  In his family  You know  Who's taking care  You know  There's like a million  George Bailey moments  In there  That town's history  Where the whole 
[01:40:30]  Well I'll give  I'll give a check  To your  You know  Baseball teams  With names  John's general store  Right  Like those  The whole community  Coming together  To do stuff  Yeah  Fuck that  I want to buy  A Jim Carrey movie  Three pack  For seven dollars  So fuck the old  Movie theater  With a Wurlitzer organ  But think of like  Think of Blockbuster Video  Now that caused a big thing  Because it pretty much  Closed down all the  Little mom and pop  Video stores  Which was a great  Family business  Which was a family  Business and shit like that  I remember those things 
[01:41:00]  And having to go in  And you'd have to buy  A membership fee  When you first get in  When it was like  A hundred bucks  And that was just  To try to keep  The store  Yeah to keep  The store open  Like  But then  Blockbuster came around  Now what do you want to do  Go into the mom and pop  And wait a week  For the latest release  Yeah why don't you  Why don't you fucking  Wait a little bit  Because I want it now  I want it now  So fuck the family  That opened that store  Yeah  And by the way  Fuck them  That they used to think  About what movies  You might like  That you might walk in  And they go  Anthony you like comedy 
[01:41:30]  Anthony we got a whole  Section for you  Do you even know  Who Francois Tatty is  And they'd show you  Something that we went  And found this  Blockbuster would never  Do that for you  Fuck them  I agree with both of you  But  So that you can  Save a little bit  Of fucking money  The local place  That Anne's talking about  You had to wait  For some asshole  To bring back  The nice new movie  It's out  You'd be like  It's out  It's like  When is it coming back  I want to watch that  Yeah so  And then Blockbuster  Said fuck that  Blockbuster said  Look we could  Just put a hundred 
[01:42:00]  Copies on the show  So you're thinking  The whole loyalty thing  Should outweigh  The convenience  Absolutely  Because you're  Supporting somebody  Who is  There's a human being  And a family  Who's living off  That business  And they give a shit  About you  By the way  Where's Blockbuster  It's fucking gone  So they leave a vacuum  Digital  You can't rent  A fucking video anymore  But why would you  Digital delivery  If there was video stores  You know why  It's like bookstores  A bookstore is not 
[01:42:30]  Just a place  Where you can buy books  It's a place  Where somebody expresses  Themselves by deciding  What books to put out there  And what books  They want to offer  Their community  Right  And that gets replaced  By Barnes and Nobles  Which means you get  The same fucking books  That every place  In the world gets  I mean not just America  Right  Every bookstore  Has exactly the same books now  I mean that's a  People don't realize  What a massive  It used to be  You go to that bookstore  You're going to get  Some weird off color  Books of this kind  Are you going to get  Maybe a right wing bookstore 
[01:43:00]  A left wing bookstore  That used to be  How people fucking  And then so  So Barnes and Nobles comes  And the difference is  A family business  Will hang on  Through the tough years  If they have half a chance  Yeah  But a corporate business  Will go  Oh we're making  We're not making  A ten trillion dollars  Just pull up stakes  And they're gone  So now there's  No more fucking bookstores  That's fucking amazing  Or video stores  No bookstores  No video stores  Right  The big Barnes and Noble 
[01:43:30]  On the Upper West  Because those are  Predatory businesses  Given your thinking though  Wouldn't we never progress  Like wouldn't  Who's progressing  That's the  That's not progression  I mean with everything  Like wouldn't we  Not  Look at the automotive business  Which is horrible now  Of course  Because of the outsourcing  Everything  But early on  There were guys  Working those lines  What about the technology  To come in and use robots  That did eliminate jobs  But it makes the car better  And faster  Yeah but that's exactly the thing 
[01:44:00]  These things like bookstores  And video stores  They weren't improved  They were destroyed  And a book is not a car  It's not a product  That needs to be perfected  Like a technology  It's about having a way of life  But now you just download it  On Kindle  Yeah  No exactly  But it's rubbed out  A whole getting out of your house  And going to a bookstore  And meeting the bookstore guy  And other people  Used to get fucking laid  By going to bookstores  A way that people  Used to get laid  Is by going to a bookstore  And standing in a section  That makes you look smart  And then a chick comes around 
[01:44:30]  Yeah  Oh do you also like this book  Oh sorry  I'm perusing this  Yeah  You can't do that anymore  When I grew up in Boston  And there was a place  In Harvard Square  Called the Coffee Connection  And this was a place  That was obsessed  With coffee  And they had coffees  From all around the world  And they'd have stuff  Like you'd get a  You'd get like a cappuccino  And they'd shave chocolate  Onto it  Not like a canister  Of chocolate powder  It took time  I mean  They had a cheese grater  And a block of chocolate 
[01:45:00]  And they'd shred chocolate  Onto the fucking thing for you  That's like how good it was  You sound like my grandfather  My grandfather talking to me  You don't even understand  The old days  No you have no idea  I know the point  You were hungover  You'd go to the fucking  Coffee Connection  And you'd sit there  Like trembling  And they'd bring you  This thing that would  Just change your life  You know they go  Hey you want to try Turkish  We have a new Turkish coffee today  It's a weird thing  Never tried it  So then Starbucks opens  Down the street  But this Coffee Connection  Hangs on  So Starbucks opens  Another one 
[01:45:30]  Like on the other side  Of them  Starbucks isn't  Doing so great  That they can open  Another one  They're just trying  To fucking kill  Oh shit  So they open like  Five within a block  Of the place  Until Coffee Connection  Goes this is getting hard  And they sell themselves  They go  Let's just be at Starbucks  Yeah  So then Starbucks  Buys them  And then closes  The other ones  And then you're just  Left with fucking  Just one choice  You get Starbucks  And the quality  Of Starbucks  Is horrible now  It's okay  And the instant  Starbucks isn't 
[01:46:00]  Making a profit  They'll give up  And then there won't  Be a fucking place  To even get coffee  Right  Then we go back  To having no coffee  Again  He's right  I remember  The lumber stores  I remember  We did a lot  Of renovation  On our old house  Because we had  Seven kids  Small house  And we were  Constantly adding  Rooms  And this and that  Mom and pop  Lumber shops  I would get in the car  With my dad  I remember  Like it was yesterday  We'd go to the local  Lumber guy  He knew my dad's  First name  We got this for you  We made your pile  It's all set  Putting a dormer  On the house 
[01:46:30]  Are you  Yep  Yep  Well you're gonna  Need some of it  No don't  I'll come over here  I'll help you out  You need that  For the joists  But it was  A social thing too  How are the kids  And how are your kids  Very social  Right  And then  The Home Depot  It's a fucking  Massive warehouse  And no one wants  To fucking help you  It's inhumane  And there's sad  People working there  Right  The buying of the lumber  Is not a happy exchange  It used to be that  You could say to yourself  You know what  If I get  If I invest  In a good saw  And I get some trucks 
[01:47:00]  I could go out  And get some fucking  Poplar  And cut it well  And people will come here  And build fucking houses  With it  Yeah  And you go  And you go  Hey  You got some nice poplar  Not as good as Joe Wilson's  Yeah well mine is down  Three cents  Right  I'll buy yours  This was like a  This was  And by the way  Hot angles  We don't improve  Through this shit  No  We actually don't  It's like  It's  What happens is  The second place product  Always wins  By being more vicious  To take over  Yeah like Microsoft  Versus Apple 
[01:47:30]  Right  Microsoft is  Bullshit software  It's hard  Compared to Apple  I know  Believe me  It's horrible  But Bill Gates  Is a capitalist  And he was vicious  And he fought Apple  And for some years anyway  Yeah yeah  America  Lived on shitty  Computer technology  Because of his  Ambition  It was a point where  We all thought Apple was gone  Yeah it's  VHS  Versus  VHS  Versus  Beta  Beta  It's still used today  Yeah  Beta videotape  Is still what most  TV shows are shot on 
[01:48:00]  Yeah  And we all watched  VHS tapes  Because the VHS people  Said  We make the second best  So we're gonna  Be cutthroat  And fucked up  And pay off people  And go to  Litigation  And like sue  Beta  And Beta's like  We just  We're making the best  We can't even get  People to buy it  Yeah yeah  And so everyone  Gets VHS  Unbelievable  This is Tesla  And fucking Edison  Edison and Tesla  Yeah  One guy's a genius  And is selling  A beautiful thing  The second place guy  Copies it 
[01:48:30]  Doesn't do it as well  And then  Takes him to court  In every fucking  State in America  And muscles him  And fights him  And outdraws him  Ruins his credibility  Gets some fucking  Texan to pay for it  And then  We all have to  Buy the shitty product  You're fucking brilliant  It's true  It's the same with cars  They would be better  If what you're saying  Was actually true  If it was like  The guys still on  The assembly line  Yeah  But your coffee story  Is deeply depressing  It is  It's what happens 
[01:49:00]  Everywhere  I was thinking  As you were talking  About that  Like the Starbucks  Popping up  Are like weeds  Yes  Taking out the really  Nice fucking crop  Yeah  Nice flowers  That's what they do  And they're only  Interesting  Putting weeds  All over the place  To destroy it  That's right  And they don't even  Make money  Like Harvard Square  Is a good example  I love Harvard Square  It's been a while  But you  You won't love it  Next time you go  It's been years  There used to be  A place called  The Tasty  And like the  Versed House  All these places  That have been there  From the 1900s  It's a sunglass hut 
[01:49:30]  And an Abercrombie  And Fitch now  Jesus  And I was talking  To one of the  Local business guys  Who owns a cigar store  He's like the last guy left  Look at you  Talking to a local  Business man  And I asked him  Are you going to go  Under too  And he said  You know what  Because he  Went to Harvard Business School  And then he opened  His little cigar store  Oh god  He said Abercrombie  And Fitch in Harvard Square  Doesn't even make a profit  They lose money  Every day  They're not  That store  The rent is so high  For what they built there  That they can't 
[01:50:00]  If they could sell jeans all day  They're not going to make a profit  They're not there  To make a profit  It's just a billboard  It's a 3D billboard  It's there so that  You'll buy Abercrombie online  And to keep it visible  In your mind  In your head  Yeah  That's fascinating  There's like the Nike store  On 50th or whatever  All those stores  They don't make a fucking dime  They lose money every day  Sure  It's worth having a giant  Global  It's like a billboard  That you walk into  That's how far away  This is from like  Your mom and pop guy  Guy has an idea  Right  Puts it out there 
[01:50:30]  I love it  Does folks love it  And they start buying it  It's not even  Wow  We're not even close  To that anymore  No  Like I'm nostalgic  For the guy who started  Wendy's  Like that's  That's now like  A great American  He's like a revolutionary  A great American story  Yeah  Or Ray Kroc  From McDonald's  Yeah  He's like  Che Guevara  Or whatever his name  He's like  Great man  They're sort of  Making a comeback  But remember  Just the local  Burger joint  Was cool  Are they  Making a comeback  A little bit 
[01:51:00]  You see more  Burger joints popping up  Maybe they're a part  Of a whole corporate thing  But they  Well like in New York  There's five guy burgers  Here  Right right right  But when we were growing up  Every town had  Its local burger guy  And they bragged  About their burger  And it was better  Than the guy's burger  From the next town over  And then you watch  Those slowly  The one in Huntington  The Choo Choo  Hamburger player  And their thing was  Well we'll bring your burger  On a nice fucking train  Right in front of you  Right  Oh here comes my order  You see it  Fucking rock in the restaurant  And it comes around  And stops at your 
[01:51:30]  You know  Your counter spot  Well that's what  It used to be like  When things were more spread out  That everyone had to have  Their own idea  Here's why you want to come here  And then I think  Instead of like  If you come here  It doesn't matter  Because we're across the street too  Right  Fuck you  Just eat this shit  You think it's going to get better  Once these big companies take over  The product goes down  What do you think about  They don't have to compete anymore  Like online purchasing then  You must do a lot of that though  Yeah I do  Yeah  No I think that's probably  That's probably the next version of it  Is that you can throw together 
[01:52:00]  A little product  And sell it online  Just be the mom and pop online thing  Because you don't need a store anymore  And then someone will figure out  How to fuck that over  Yeah  But you can't  Because it's not real estate  You can't take over  You can't push somebody off the internet  Yeah  They'll always be there  That's true  But you can be the better online  Yeah they'll make you  Or the bigger  And  They'll make you have the website  With .org  Yeah  They'll give you a dot something  That no one does  But if you're like a mom and pop thing  And you're selling  Let's say electronics  You'd be like  Oh great 
[01:52:30]  They don't have that  Let me go to Best Buy's website  Fucking  No that's absolutely true  That's hard  Yeah  Hard to sell  Yeah  Just to add to the discussion  I used to be a big music store guy  And every music store  Was a little different  And this guy  If you got to know him  He's like  I got some fucking bootlegs  You might want to see  That's right  And it's completely illegal  And we know it  But I've seen you in this place  Enough times  That I know you're not a rat  So why don't you follow me  Well that's exactly it  Remember that shit  Guys like Iggy Pop  Iggy Pop becoming popular  Was a good thing  I think for America 
[01:53:00]  It's a good thing  For the American voice  That guys like that  But the reason he came up  Was because certain record stores  Would go  I'm fucking digging Iggy Pop  And I'm going to make a  I'm going to sort of  Take a gamble  That my customers will like him  Right  So they'd go  They'd order like  Give me 10 Iggy Pop  You know 12 inches  And they'd put him out there  Right  And the kid with the leather jacket  Who the fuck is this guy  Right  I'd try him out kid  You're right old man  Fuck you  You know  And he'd try Iggy Pop  And he'd go  Holy motherfucking shit  And all of a sudden  Iggy Pop is flying off the shelves 
[01:53:30]  When I was growing up  But now if you're not  On fucking iTunes  Like the whole country  Has to make one decision  Of who we like  There's no sort of  Local guy  God that's  That's a massive  Massive difference  In how  Absolutely  The culture grows  I just loved  When I was growing up  I would go to the village  And all those  Underground record stores  I would spend all afternoon there  And every place  Had something a little different  So what is this  Bootleg  Like concert shirts  And  What's the bottom line  Of what this does  To society  No one even 
[01:54:00]  Has  Even young people  Don't even consider the idea  That it's a good idea  To be off  Out in the fringe  Which is where  Good ideas come from  Yeah  Like people are almost  Like begging  The government  To take over  And the corporations  To take over your life  Like people are excited  That when you take a picture  Of yourself on your phone  And put it online  It says where the fuck you were  Why are people excited about that  What is that  Like I remember when  Easy Pass first happened  Yeah  Everyone was like  I don't want everybody  Knowing when I went  To the Lincoln Tunnel  Like what are you 
[01:54:30]  Fucking carrying  Secret documents  Who the fuck  Gives a shit about you  But people used to  Think that way  Right  Cameras in Central Park  For crime  Yeah but what about  My privacy  But now people are like  Guess what  If I take a picture  And send it to somebody  The whole world knows  Exactly where I was  Where I was at that  And I can store  All of everything I have  On a computer  In North Carolina  And I don't even have to  And they get to have  All my stuff  And Facebook knows  Who all my friends are  And what I've said  To all of them  Every single fucking  Conversation I've ever had 
[01:55:00]  Is a public record  In the fucking  Library of Congress  Yay  Cool  That is fucked up  Isn't that cool  And we worried about  Easy Pass  A mere three years ago  People were excited  People were excited  Three years ago  Right  It's true  Everything you tell somebody  I think I might be pregnant  It's in the Library of Congress  Now  Now it's forever  Cool  And there's a fucking  Geotag on it  Saying where you were standing  When you fucking said it  A fucking coordinate  Yeah 
[01:55:30]  A global coordinate  Of where you were standing  Of where you were standing  And longitude  Of when you said that  And when you took a picture  But we didn't want to use  Easy Pass  Three years ago  Yeah  That is really fucked up  It's sick  It is really fucked up  You have to belong  To a fucking club  To listen to a song  You have to have a credit card  To like listen to a song  You can't go buy a record  And play it  You have to  If you fucking lose  Your credibility 
[01:56:00]  And your iTunes account  Gets suspended  You can't play any of your music  On anything  You're done  You can't listen  Now we're on satellite radio  You have to subscribe  Yes  To listen to the radio  Like the only way  To listen to music  Without being a credible  American citizen  With a credit card  Belonging to a corporation  The only way  You can fucking whistle  That's about the only way  That's how you can hear the song  That's the only  Whistling to yourself  The only time you can  Unless you want to join some  Yeah because there are 
[01:56:30]  A lot of  The music stores  Don't even carry fucking  There's no music stores  There's no music stores  You gotta go to Best Buy  And they got their CD section  Which is dying out  It's being pushed  Yeah and it's just  And it's just a reflection  Of what's on iTunes  Yeah and you don't  Yeah yeah  Amazon  You don't have a guy  Taking care of that section  So it's all just  Kind of willy nilly  You're not finding  Something new  And eclectic  No  The problem  And the problem  Is what Louie's  Getting at  Is with corporate America  Only a few of the people  In corporate America  Actually make the money  Then everyone else  Is just slaves 
[01:57:00]  To that fucking corporation  And they're not even American  I mean it's all offshore  All the companies  Are unaccountable  And they're offshore  And most of them  Are foreign owned anyway  Go with the Tower Records  Each Tower Records  Probably was easily 10  Easily 10  You know mom and pop  Record stores  And those guys  Were actually making  A real living  And now like you said  About Atlantic City  Tower Records moves in  And now you used to  Make a living  Now you're just  Working for that schmuck  Yep  And then Tower Records  Is gone  So they leave a vacuum  It's not even  This idea that  Everybody's like  Yeah but come on 
[01:57:30]  But this is good for what  The convenience is  It's like locusts  It's like locusts  They just come in  Eat it all  And then they're gone  And nothing's left  I know but still  It's probably  You know if we didn't do that  Progress  You wouldn't have  The thing that  You wouldn't have  The polio vaccine  The cars run worse  Than they did in the 70s  And I could go back  You need a computer  To fix one  Yeah you can't work  On your car  No  That's true too  You cannot pop the hood  On your fucking car  No  And work on it 
[01:58:00]  I remember if your car stalled  You would ease over  A shoulder  And you lift the hood  And you look  Fuck around with it  And you'd be like  Alright I know enough  About the distributor  I think this is something  I think maybe  Let's see if that's tight  Yeah I think  You can tighten this a little bit  My points  I'm going to jiggle this cord  I'm going to gap it  With a matchbook cover  You can actually do that  That'll get me home  It'll run a little fucked up  But that'll get me home  Yeah you can do that  If you knew where the fuel pump was  You could jiggle it a little bit  Yeah give it a little knock 
[01:58:30]  If you caught it and start  You'd hit the starter a little bit  And then boom  I had a 68 Mustang  And I used to fix it  I worked in a garage  When I was younger  And I used to fix it  So I'd like  The fuel pump  Would go  Like the fuel pump  That was in there  Since 1968  Died in like 1993  And then I put in  A new fuel pump  And that fuel pump  Died in 1995  And I went through  Three fuel pumps  On that car  Same  Every part of it  The starter  That this car  That was put in 
[01:59:00]  By some fucking  Heavy Michigan hands  In 1968  When I was one year old  Some fucking guy  With a cigarette dangling  Put that starter in  Yeah yeah  And then went to  A very beautiful home  In Flint, Michigan  Which is now  A fucking crack house  He's been dead for years  His wife  Picket fence  His wife was waiting  For him to come home  And then finally  That starter  That he fucking  Personally tightened  Every part of  Finally just went  I can't do it anymore  And died  In 1994  Yeah 
[01:59:30]  And then I took it out  And it was heavy  And it was beautiful  It was like a piece of art  And then I put it in  With this  I put in this thing  I got at a parts store  And I asked them  I said  Give me the best starter  Available  And they gave me  This starter  And the metal  It was made out of  Is some weird composite  You could see like  Coke can pieces in it  And I put it in  It didn't weigh anything  And I stuck it in  And it lasted like  Six months  And it just  Bang  Just came apart  When you used to  Drop the starter motor  It was like 
[02:00:00]  When you pulled those  Bolts out  It was heavy  And then the new one  You hold it up  With one arm  As you're threading  The fucking bolt  Look at the picture  Danny just found  You can't work  On that engine  That's what you see  Right  Just a big block  With a logo on it  Right  That's it  That's a Cadillac  Powered by Cadillac  It looks like  It just all melted together  You can't get at it  It's all just  Cowling that they put on  So you dare not  Even look  And see what's under there 
[02:00:30]  You can't work on it  Because it's all computerized  Now if your car  Breaks down  You can't hook a computer  Up to it  In a corporate place  If it breaks down  You're lucky enough  To get out  Of your own car  Yeah  Exactly  You'd be lucky  If you could at least  Leave the car  Holy shit  I keep going back  To the coffee thing  Because I was a big  Coffee guy as well  Yeah  And when Starbucks  Did hit  It made it convenient  That there were more  Nice coffee places  Because you really  Had to search them out  Like you were talking about  Right  And I didn't live  Anywhere near Harvard Square  So a Starbucks 
[02:01:00]  Was like nice  Instead of shitty  Diner coffee  Right  But then Starbucks  Didn't care about  Their product in the end  At first  The coffee was amazing  But you watched it  Drop over the years  Yeah they had to  They had to compete  Now you know  The beans they're getting  Have to be just shitty  Of course they are  They have to be  They're not going to  Work hard for your money  Why would they  They've got to  At first they needed  Your money  So they worked hard for it  Exactly  I explain this shit  To my kids all the time  Because we'll go off  The beaten path  We'll go three blocks over  And spend 40 more cents 
[02:01:30]  That what are we doing  With this precious money  That people are like  Well I'm saving  So that I can buy  Some fucking video game  Have a video game experience  For 10 seconds  That evaporates  From my existence later  What are we saving  The money for  But we go a few blocks over  Spend a few more cents  To go to like a butcher  Yeah yeah  Instead of going to  You know  That  Price chopper  We go to fucking  New York City butcher  Yeah  Where the guy's got  A red face  How you doing my man 
[02:02:00]  And you know  Blood all over his  Fucking little  Yeah  Apron that he's wearing  Gets his steak  His steak's from  A fucking place  Where there's like  A direct line  From the cow  To the steak  Right yeah  Yeah instead of  This fucking shop right  You know probably  Some human parts  In the steak thing  I was going to  Like somebody  Go oh you want  To get something for lunch  Let's go to like  Subway or something  I'm like why would you  Not just go to a  Deli  Like you get a real  Sandwich made on  A hero roll 
[02:02:30]  That was in a bakery  That morning  And the driver  Took it over  A place where they're  Not going to measure  The meat  I remember  I was a guy  All pre-cut  Where the local guy  Goes oh Anthony  You know you've been  A good customer  Here's a few extra  Slices  The Subway  They actually weigh  Their meat and their  Tomatoes  To make sure  It's the proper weight  I was in a Subway  Once in somewhere  In Arizona  And I was driving  Across the country  And I stopped  It was a Subway  Inside of a fucking  Sunoco station  You know what I mean  Yeah  And there was  The fucking kid

[02:03:30]  Sauce do you want  On  And he's like  Um  And like  I guess I'll get  Go ahead and get  The green one  And he's making  It for him  And I wanted him  To say  Should I just  Eat it too  Does it even  Make a difference  Which one of us  Eats it  Like everyone's  Just on one side  Of the counter  Or the other  There's no identity  To any American  The only identity  You have is what  Your sauce choice is  Yeah  Like that's  The only thing  You get now  Is like  Well I like  I particularly like  You do make this 
[02:04:00]  Grim kind of image  Of I don't see  I don't see this  Going to a good place  No it's not man  No it's not  No it's not  The only good thing  That could happen  Is that it all falls  That it just all  Collapses  It all dies  And everyone has to  Look around them  And go what could I  Piece together  And sell  Maybe recycle  For my friends  Maybe  Post apocalyptic  Lifestyle  Would be terrific  Yeah  We got a timing issue  So we're going to  Take a break  Because we got  Rummy calling  Right at 830  Oh boy  What happened  Just Rummy

[02:06:30]  Become dated  So quickly  That a few short  Years later  You know borders  Move and people  Take over power  And you'd just read  These encyclopedias  But that was like  Your internet  That's right  The only information  You were able to get  At the drop of a hat  Was in your encyclopedias  In your house  You used to sit there  And toil  If you didn't know  Something  And couldn't find it  Out in your house  Through some kind of  Book or newspaper  You didn't know it  Where this stuff is good  Is things like 
[02:07:00]  The internet  Because if you lived  In you know  Oshkosh  Michigan or someplace  You weren't going  To get a cool book  You weren't going  To get Alice  Doesn't Live Here Anymore  And you weren't  Going to get  An Iggy Pop album  Right  You were going  To get a Pat Boone  Album  And whatever  And Encyclopedia Britannica  That's it  You had to live on that  Yeah  But hey  You throw on a leather jacket  And leave town  You fucking  What's your problem  This is the worst  Of the Opie Anthony show  Hey asshole  You guys suck  Serious accent 
[02:07:30]  Without just glossing over  A comedian  And his material  What more  Are you trying to get in  Like what  The mind of a comic  And what  What makes them like that  Well we're done with you  There he is  Norm  Did you get my fucking text  About your show  No  I love it  We're on the air  It's okay  It's good  They're greeting each other  Norm MacDonald  What's up boys  I see you  I do my YouTube videos 
[02:08:00]  And stuff  It's fun  You know  You fuck off  A little bit  Here and there  How you doing  Sit down  Take a seat  I think we're  Kind of running out  Of seats  Take the couch  Right there  Oh my god  Saw the special  The other night  We're not on the fucking  Oh yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  We do that  You can say fucking  Fucking  That's how we roll  We're on the radio right now  We just bring it in  And let it roll  That's how that works  I know 
[02:08:30]  You're looking  At a picture  Colin's looking  At a picture of Hitler  That's my room  I'm looking for  Different motifs  That's your screen saver  That's my screen saver  I didn't put it on my cans  You know Jim Norton  Yeah we just saw  Jimmy  Jimmy Norton  See we like bringing  Everybody in  At different times  The host of the show  The guests  I saw you guys  On the YouTube  You know  I saw you  And Jim  And you  Yeah yeah  It was awesome  On YouTube  Yeah you never 
[02:09:00]  Watch fucking YouTube  What the fuck  What was that  Yeah you watch the TV  This fucking guy  I know TV  TV's like extinct now  TV's for the old fuckers  I watch the YouTube  Fucking face  All that shit  Yeah  What about this new thing  What's that  No it's called Colors  Have you heard about it  Oh we were just  Talking about that  I'm a fan of Colors  We were just talking  About that  Isn't that fucking weird  No but it's only  150 yards  Yeah  People within 150 yards  Yeah  You got it yet  I don't know  It seems a little  Fucking weird  It is weird 
[02:09:30]  Like a guy in your  Apartment building  Can see what you're doing  Depending on where he is  Yeah maybe you could  Figure out where a lady was  Like looking at  The layout of her apartment  And then maybe  I don't know  I think  I think it'll come in handy  For  I don't know what it is  I think it'll come in handy  Tell Colin what it is  For football players  On the field  Because it's 150 yards  So he pretty much  Covers the field  And they could probably  Figure out what the other team  Is going to do  Based on what they're  Doing with their color  You don't watch a lot of football  No none at all  150 yards  Well you know 
[02:10:00]  You got to consider  The end zone  I was considering the end zones  Oh okay  I got it  You know the entire field  You're still off though  A little bit  Why how long are the end zones  10 right  It's got to be longer than 10  No it's not  It's got to clear  Canadian football  No no no  Not real football  You got the 100 yards  And then how wide is the end zone  It seems about 10 right  Yeah let's go with a 10  That's it  So you were off by 30 yards  30  What about after there  But behind the end zone  To the wall  Alright now you're talking  150 yards  What if they jump in the stands  Yeah I've seen that happen 
[02:10:30]  Give me a break  Hold on I gotta get this  So Norm you were on  Saturday Night Live  Yeah until Colin showed up  I know  Colin took your gig  He took my gig  He took my apartment  Did he take the apartment too  Yeah I moved in  The same building as Norm  No you really are a fuck  Single white female  No there was one moment  Colin probably doesn't remember it  But I was walking to the elevator  And he was coming off the elevator  Do you remember that  Wouldn't be that 
[02:11:00]  It happened all the time  No I know  This was  This was a little more detail  The time you took the elevator  This was after I had left  And you would come on  And it was like  It was  I don't know  It was poignant to me  Oh sort of a changing of position  You had to shake Norm's hand  And he spit in your face  Do you remember that time  No  No Colin was awesome  You didn't have any animosity  Towards Colin  Not towards Colin  No I loved Colin  I heard you were taken off  Of that show  Because of the OJ situation  I don't know  I don't think it was really 
[02:11:30]  You don't think that was it  No I don't really think it was that  Because you gave OJ a little guff  And most people were just  Treating him like a saint  Yeah but I don't know  I know people said that and shit  But I think  You know what I think it was  Is because I didn't get laughs  All the time and shit  And like  Ohmire was watching Leno  Who would get laughs  Wall to wall  Every fucking night  Yeah but that isn't  What it was about  I know but I can understand  His point  I kind of liked the delivery  And the fucking very dry wit  Of that whole thing  The problem is  If one guy don't like you  And he owns the cameras  You're fucked 
[02:12:00]  Yeah  But I think it was also  That Omeyer  When he actually  Would say something  About like OJ  Like you know  If you get pissed  Then Norm would just say  Alright fuck him  And do like five more  Oh okay  Other people would go like  Hey okay  I'll keep my gig  Yeah we didn't listen to anybody  And also  I don't think also  We were listening to people  Within Saturday Night Live  Which was probably a mistake too  You know because Jim was  You know what I mean  Yeah  How about my impression  Of Jim that everybody hates  Yeah  I hate it too 
[02:12:30]  How could they hate that  It's great  It's right on the money  I don't even know who it is  It sounds like him  It's perfect  Hey man who got a comedy award  Anybody here  Damn I think one person did  Huh  Who  You  I'm saying the comedy awards  I never got  No the comedy awards  You don't know about the comedy awards  It was a big event the other night  Big event  Well I wasn't there  The Lifetime Achievement Award  Tina Fey I think  No Eddie  Eddie Murphy  Well that  No what did Tina get

[02:16:30]  On TV like that  It was so fucking good  And the thing about you  I don't know what it is  With that voice of yours  When I read your tweets  Everybody that I talk to  Also reads them  In Norm's voice  And it makes it  That much funnier  Everybody started  During the Oscars  We all start tweeting  Our shit during the Oscars  Past Oscars  And one of my buddies  Travis actually  Retweeted and said  You gotta follow  Norm Macdonald  I'm like  I didn't even know  You were on a shit 
[02:17:00]  So I started following you  And they were hilarious  Like  When are you gonna  Thank the computer  Every fucking tweet  When are you gonna  Thank the computer  Just shit like that  Is stuff that  No one else was tweeting  It's out of your mind  Shit  I just found out  About that tweeter shit  It's great  And you got  So many followers  Really quickly  And didn't have to  Pull a Charlie Sheen  With it  It was just funny shit  But when you go  To hit the send  You fuck for a second 
[02:17:30]  You go wait  Cause it's just  Off the top of your head  And it's right there  And I don't do drugs  Or alcohols  Thankfully  Cause  I'm sure guys  Could really fuck up  And say bad things  They have  Louis CK  Has had to delete  Entire threads  Of things he's twittered  The worst thing is too  And especially  If you have a lot of followers  Because that's what he does  Oh yeah  Sometimes even  He'll even feel bad about it  And just go back  A lot of times  If you tweet something  And you want to delete it  Even a second later  If you have a lot of followers 
[02:18:00]  They got it  It's already been retweeted  And you can't delete theirs  So  You know  If you got ten followers  And you write something about  Hey those Japanese people  By the way  And then they can retweet it  Exponentially  And then it just goes on and on  That shit was censorship man  He went from the nuclear breakdown  It's censorship  You know  We should be able to talk about anything man  It's America  Norm's tweets  Like some of them  Are not supposed to be funny  They're like profound  Yeah  Poetic  Yeah  I deleted a lot of those  Cause I'd read my responses 
[02:18:30]  They'd go  You fucking asshole  You're funny  I'm like  That's just it  You can't stop being like  If you're funny  And then you got like  A serious comment  Like I would  I would tweet some ridiculous shit  But then I'd go like  Ah you know  Obama gave his speech  Let me give a little feedback  On what I believe Obama  You racist  Fucking  Yeah  Conservative  Fucking  Rich  Motherfucker  Some people too  Fucking  Think it's serious  Like I tweeted  I tweeted one  That I  I said  My  Some  I don't know  I said like  My father was brutally murdered 
[02:19:00]  The  Last week  And it's only now  I can look back and laugh  And then  These people  Would fucking answer  They'd go like  I'm so sorry  Like  Closure takes a while  So I had to go  No no  It was a joke  That's cool  How does anyone read that  And not  Especially from you  And not think  It's a joke  People are so  That's something  This whole thing  Has opened up  Where  You're  You're kind of  Communicating  With people 
[02:19:30]  You never would  Talk to  Or meet  That  That you know  Don't understand  What a sense of humor  Even is  So the responses  You get sometimes  Like  Just  Like  Hey  I was like  Hey  You know  God  It's spring  But I'm looking outside  There's still a little snow  On my back table  At least you're alive  Motherfucker  You know  That was for a dead guy  I'm getting tweets  From the dead  I guess he had a loved one  Pass on  Perhaps a father 
[02:20:00]  That was brutally murdered  A week ago  I guess to sum it up  Everybody's a critic  Huh guys  Your special should have been  Called the voice of reason  You're doing a sports show  Yeah  Yeah  I guess I didn't know  You were that into sports  But then again  I don't know much about football  I'm into sports a lot  But not enough to  Like now I have to go on  Fucking like these sports  Yeah  You're going to be like  The sports guy  I don't know that much shit

[02:31:00]  Where is that  Like where are you  As far as that goes  Are you authentically  Petrified of the end  Or of falling apart  I mean I shouldn't  Think about it  As much as I do  You do  Do you lay there  I go fucking  I get a lot of tests  Do you  Yeah  Make sure everything's  Cool  This happened to me  One time  Because like  People say  You're a hypochondriac  And shit  But I'm like  No fuck  That's not it  It's like  The only chance  You got is early detection  That's all you got  And so 
[02:31:30]  I used to go  To the Mayo Clinic  You know  In Rochester  Minnesota  Every year  And I would have  This is what I'd do  Because I don't  This is what doctors do  They'll just  Fucking  You go  Hey I got a cough  That's probably a cold  Right  You know what I mean  They just brush everything off  Especially if they know  You're a hypochondriac  That's what they told  Jim Henson  Yeah exactly  So what I would do  Is I'd go to  This is what happened  I went to  Rochester Mayo Clinic  And I would exaggerate  All my symptoms  So I'd go to the  I'd go to the stomach guy 
[02:32:00]  He goes  What do you got  I go  I'm fucking  Shit in blood  I'm coughing up blood  Holy fuck  So he'd give me  A full thing  I wanted to make sure  I got a full thing  So every fucking guy  Blood was coming out  Of my nose  And ears  And my asshole  So anyways  Just so I'd get  A full clean bill of health  So I did  And then  That's when I'm most happy  Is just when I'm walking  Out of that place  Now how long does that last  That doesn't last long  Because obviously  Something can pop up  Obviously two days later 
[02:32:30]  The fucking thing can start  But then  A fucking  Six months later  I decided  I'd never had insurance before  So I decided to get  Life insurance  Couldn't get it  Right  So I was like  Holy fuck  Because sometimes  They mix up files  And shit  I said  I must have something  Wrong with me  Oh no  And so I fucking  Said why the fuck  Can I get  Nobody will accept me  For life insurance  Anyway it turns out  That the life insurance  People are privy  To all the doctor's notes  Oh so you were saying  So they got the doctor's notes  Even though I have  A clean bill of health  They go this guy 
[02:33:00]  Is shitting blood  Fucking blood everywhere  You know  Fucking insure this motherfucker  Yeah  So they said  He must have  Some unknown disease  Oh shit  Oh shit  So it took me a long time  And then finally  Had to get that  Fucking Ed McMahon  Life insurance  I like those guys  They're like  Hey man  Will nobody  Fucking give you  Life insurance  On account of  You're fucking  Old and sick  And gonna die  Here we'll give it to you  A dollar a month 
[02:33:30]  If you're 65 or older  You could get  Term life insurance  And then it says  Doesn't kick in  For three years  Premiums  You know  Plus imagine  If you're the  Fucking guy  That's asked to do  That commercial  And it's like  And no medical tests  We won't ask  Any medical questions  Right  Imagine you're an actor  Like you're fucking  Like Robert Wagner  Yeah  You know  That's a  You know  Like hey man  Do you think about  Death every fucking day  Like me  Did you never 
[02:34:00]  Fucking  Take  Take care of your family  At any point  Until right now  When you're on  Your deathbed  Until now  Holy shit man  Yeah I did notice  During the special  There were a lot  Of those things  But you  Make them  It's very rare  That you could use  The word cancer  In a bit  And actually  Make it funny  It was just  Yeah  No I'm not like  That's not what  I talk about  That was just  A certain period  Of time  No that's what I mean  Thinking about shit 
[02:34:30]  I noticed  Because I'm very bad  With me being alone  With my own thoughts  At night  A lot of times  If I'm just  In a quiet room  Without the TV on  Like I'll just  Think too much  To go to sleep  And it could be anything  It could be like  Oh there's a kind of  A program I want to  Maybe work on  Tomorrow on the computer  Or it could be  Hey I wonder  When I'll die  You know  And so I like  Having the TV on  Just for that  Are you good  With your own thoughts  Just laying there  In the quiet  I'm not good  I try to 
[02:35:00]  Because you know  You try something  To get off  Whatever the fuck  You'd use  To quiet your mind  Whether it's booze  Or whatever the fuck  Pills  Whatever it is  But I try  So I try  Meditation  Try that  To me it worked  The opposite  Like I'm sitting  In a room of people  They go  Just close your eyes  They go  Thoughts will happen  No fucking kidding  Erasing hellish thoughts  And then the guy's like  Just let them go  And then you open 
[02:35:30]  Your eyes  You look at some  Other fuckers  Right beside you  And I tried it  Three times  I could never  Get to any place  Of quiet  No I need a lot  Of distractions  And I could still  Operate and work  Like I could  I could make myself  You know go to sleep  Or if I'm working  On a computer  Or something  I'm good with the TV  On or something  Like that  But I need  This constant  Little distraction  Because if you're  Just left alone  To your own devices  Your thoughts  Will turn horrid  I stumped a fucking  Psychiatrist once  I said to the guy 
[02:36:00]  Because I was fucking  Gambling all the time  Shit right  I had a gambling addiction  I'm over it now  But shit  But he said  I bet you're not  That's a good one  He almost lost everything  Oh shit  You haven't met Chip  Yes Chip Chipperson  Is very funny  But he said  The psychiatrist  He said  You're using gambling  You're using  You know  You're fixating  On gambling  In order to 
[02:36:30]  Escape your real thoughts  You know  And I said to him  Isn't that why  You do everything  In life  And literally  I stumped him  He had no answer  He was like  Huh  And then he  Recovered  And tried to make it  But isn't that  Why you do everything  Yes  So you're not  Sitting at home  Just thinking  Thinking about  What's really  Going to happen to us  Where it all ends  What was your  Gambling poison there  What did you  Enjoy  Sports  Sports  Gambling  Sports was the worst 
[02:37:00]  You weren't a casino guy  No I did everything  But sports was  Sports was the one  That you think  You can pick  You know what I mean  You delude yourself  Into going  You've sports gambled  I've never sports gambled  In your life  Well maybe once  I got that slip  And I knew nothing  And I filled shit out  I could have won  What about you  A little bit  Not like you  I've heard the norm stories  I'm a blackjack guy  Oh yeah  I play blackjack  What was your biggest loss  Did you talk about it 
[02:37:30]  Not really  I don't blame you  A lot  It was a lot  You're over it though  I did a stupid thing one time  This was my big  This was my big statement  I threw  Over at Atlantic City  On the boardwalk  I threw 60,000  Into the ocean  No way  Yeah  To quit  That was my thing  I'm going to quit  Why didn't you just quit  And keep the 60  It was 
[02:38:00]  It was like  It was supposed to be like  I felt like  I was in a movie  Wow  That was a symbolic  Kind of a thing  Like was it money  Or chips  What's that  It was money  Holy shit  I said chips  And he goes  What's that  So you threw 60  Because you had a moment  Where you're like  This is cleansing  This is like  To the ocean  The same way  A drug addict  Would throw his drugs  Into the ocean  How long after  It left your hand  Did you regret it  I regret it  It was pretty great  See I would have  Thrown the fucking dealer 
[02:38:30]  Into the ocean  That's how I would  Get over it  I'm always surprised  I'm surprised  That people  Like dealers  Don't get  Killed  Killed  It really is amazing  Because they can  Piss you off  I've seen dealers  Do things where  It's like  And  In succession  Where you're like  Alright look  I'm finally getting  Good cards  I'm pulling 20s  Out here  And the dealer  Is consistently  Showing a dumb  4 or a 3  And that 7  8 pops up  And here's  The ever present  Picture card  Or anytime  Like they're dealing  Around and I'm like 
[02:39:00]  Okay king  And now they go  Around for the  Second one  4  But whenever you  See them showing  A picture card  That down card  It's always a face  Card or an ace  Insurance  Is that your game  That's your game  Yeah I have  I have yelled  I've gotten to the  Point where  The guy  The guy  My security guy  Keith the cop  Had to get  A pillow  And bring it  Down because  I was turning  Around and  Punching him  In the shoulder  So hard when  They would pull  This bullshit  On me  And I was  Yelling where

[02:48:00]  At  That  It's  Wonderful  So  Look at  Your  Smug  Face  Oh  I'm  So  Smug  Just  Rubbing  It  In  To  Anyone  That  Follows  You  On  Twitter  Or  If  Anybody  Was  Walking  Past  In  The  Isle  They  Look  At  That  And  Are  Just  Like  You  Mother  Fucker  Well  I  Paid  For  It  Dearly  Because  They  Finally  Canceled  The  Flight  And  This  Is  Directly  Because  Of  The  Rule  Where  You  Can't  Have  A  Plane  Sitting  And  Not  Taking  Off  Within  A  Certain  Amount  Of  Time  How  Many  Hours  Is  It  Because  They  Canceled  A lot  Of 
[02:48:30]  Flights  Just  They  Don't  Pay  Fines  They  Don't  Want to  Pay  The  Fines  Anymore  They  Just  Don't  Want to  Pay  I  Don't  Even  Know  How  Long  It  Is  But  They  Don't  Want  To  Pay  Fine  So  They  Just  Cancel  The  Flight  Everyone  Get  The  Fuck  Off  The  Plane  Grab  Your  Shit  Get  Off  Is  It  Terrible  Though  I  Mean  How  Many  Hours  You  Think  He  Would  Have  Sat  There  I  Mean  He  Had  I  Would  Have  Laid  There  Like  A  King  The  The  Problem  Was  That  The  Airlines  Had  Five  And  Six  And  Eight  Hours  Where  They  Would  Just  Hold  People  On  Planes  Who  Wanted  To  Get  Off  That  Is  Terrible  But  This  Is  Like  Legitimate  Like  This  Is  Storms 
[02:49:00]  And  There  Is  A  Ground  Stoppage  I  Think  What  They  Should  Do  Is  Before  You  Get  On  The  Plane  They  Should  Say  Look  We  Don't  Know  We  May  Have  Delays  Of  Up  To  Four  Five  Hours  As  Opposed  To  Three  If  You  Don't  Want  To  Be  On  This  We'll  Try  To  Accommodate  They  Should  Give  People  A  Choice  When  It's  Pure  Weather  It's  Not  Like  It  Was  An  Equipment  Malfunction  It's  50  Mile  An  Hour  Winds  What  Are  You  Can't  Take  Off  Exactly  That's  All  It takes  50  Mile  An  Hour  Winds  You  Can't  Take  Off  You  Can't  Land  Good  Pilot  Could  Do  It  Yeah  Come  On  Colonel  Tibbetts 
[02:49:30]  We've  Seen  The  Videos  Doolittle  Doolittle  And  His  His  Men  Could  Have  Done  It  Yeah  They  Didn't  Give  A  Shit  And  They  Were  Being  Shot  At  For  God's  Sake  What  Is  The  Limit  I  Wonder  On  When  What  We've  Landed  In  35  And  It 
[02:50:00]  One  Out of  Ten  It  Was  Pretty  Bad  So  I  Wonder  What  The  Limit  Is  I  Don't  Know  I  Would  Bet  Close  To  50  Probably  I  Would  Think  They  Could  Do  50  Mile  An  Hour  Winds  It 
[02:50:30]  That's  That's  Where  The  Thing  Is  Our  Baggage  Is  On  That  Plane  And  They  Go  Well  There's  A  Plane  Going  To  LaGuardia  It's  Leaving  In  Ten  Minutes  I'm  Like  Whoop  Pew  Wait  So  They  Don't  Want  That  Plane  To  Take  Off  That's  Going  To  Land  At  JFK  But  There's  A  Plane  That  Lands  At  LaGuardia  I  Don't  Know  How  Works  Either  Is  That  What  Yeah  You  Gonna  Fly  Into  JFK  Yeah  Cause  I  Got  Something  On  This  LaGuardia  Is  Scary  If  There's  No  Wind 
[02:51:00]  I  Know  Because  They  Have  A  Short  They  Have  Short  Runways  Short  Runway  They  Make  Like  Banking  Turns  To  Line up  For  These  Runways  And  Then  The  Runways  Are  Really  Short  LaGuardia  Is  Really  Scary  To  Fly  Yeah  Well  Wait  A  That  Doesn't  Make  Sense  No  It  Didn't  No  You  Know  Because  They  Probably  Knew  They  Had  To  Wait  Another  Hour  Right  I  Guarantee  There  Was  A  Delay  On  The  Next  Flight  Right  Oh  And  The  Problem  Is  If  He  Was  On  The  Original  767  That  Would  Have  Gone  Past  The  Time  The  LaGuardia  Flight  Was  Probably  Not  Going  Past  The  Time  So  Penalties 
[02:51:30]  You're  Right  But  The  Delays  Are  Because  Of  Bad  Weather  Wind  And  I  Would  Never  Fly  So  They  Were  Lying  Is  What  They  Were  Doing  They  Were  Lying  Saying  10  Minutes  So  It  Was  Boarding  In  10  Minutes  So  Me  And  My  Girl  We  Jump  On  This  Plane  And  Now  It's  A  757  They  Can't  Land  The  767  Of  LaGuardia  And  I'm  In  The  Back  I'm  In  The  Back  No  I'm  In  A  Regular  Seat  No  With  The  Common  Folk  Feeling  What

[03:19:30]  Stupid birds  Fucking hate birds  And you know  Big zip lines  And bridges  And things  Did you zip line  I didn't zip line  I saw people zip line  Why did you zip line  I wanted to hang out  With the monkeys  What is zip line  You were scared to zip line  No no I would have ziplined  I would have ziplined  I would have ziplined  I would have ziplined  I would have a kid ziplining  I've never ziplined  I want to so badly  They set up these  Friggin cables  From treetop to treetop  And you hold on  And little platforms  And you click on  And  And the whole time  You're walking around  You just hear  Why didn't you do that  People are ziplining around 
[03:20:00]  It's like traffic up there  Why didn't you do that  I didn't want to zipline  How about no  Why would you  There's fucking bees all over  What are you going to zipline  Right through a hornet's nest  What's the fuck with that  That would suck  You imagine you're ziplining  All of a sudden  You see a bunch of bees  Have landed on your location  And you're fucking  Doing 80 into them  Why would you want to do that  Never  Why  Take the tram to Roosevelt Island  It's safer  You got harnesses and stuff  You got a hard hat  Yeah  They give you a hard hat  A harness  A safety line  And they were just people 
[03:20:30]  Zipping and zinging everywhere  That's cool  I can't believe you didn't do that  Watching some of the employees  Leave the tree  On the zipline  Was kind of funny  I'm just saying  It's kind of funny  They're very good at it  Is all I'm saying  Were some of the ziplines  Pretty impressive  Over some  Yeah  Some hype  Over some major hype  Fuck  And they were getting guys  That could get some speed up  And stuff  Where can we zipline around here  I don't think they got zipline  In America  Let's get a zipline trip together  Would you go Jimmy  Lawsuit city  No I would not go  Here's why they don't have it in America  Because it's not safe 
[03:21:00]  No we have it in America  Let's all relax  I know we have it in America  Let's calm down  Do they have it in America  I'm sure  I'm sure it's right upstate  We could do some ziplining  I'm positive  You think they could do ziplining upstate  Yes  It's everywhere  It's becoming the thing  It's becoming a thing  It's the thing  In America  Yeah with rope bridges  And ziplines  Ziplining is becoming a thing  Ziplining is taking off  You guys have a wonderful ziplining excursion  Hunter Mountain  There you go 
[03:21:30]  Cool  That's very close to here  Hunter Mountain does ziplining  That's what two hours away maybe  I did not know that  I'm fucking ziplining this spring  Let's go  Who wants in  I don't think I'd zipline  You said you would  Especially in the US  No no  I mean it just sounds like  It would be safer in the US than Mexico  It sounds like it would be cool  In Mexico or somewhere  But not there  Look look at this guy  Carolina man  Oh you're so right  Ziplined in Hawaii  Recently a quarter mile long  Half mile in the air  Over a ravine  Fucking amazing  Why wouldn't you do that  I don't doubt that it's quite amazing 
[03:22:00]  Quite amazing  Anyway you decided to hang out  With the monkeys  Instead of the zipliners  If I had the choice  Between ziplining  And having a spike  Shoved up my asshole  And being carried that way  I'd take ziplining  But I'd have to think about it  But you don't do stuff  Why don't you do stuff  I do a lot of stuff  I always do stuff  I just don't swing  From tree to tree  By a fucking  By a rope  I don't do that  I do lots of stuff  Yes  You don't do stuff  I love doing stuff  You don't do much 
[03:22:30]  My nickname is  The Stuff Kid  You don't do much  Let's be honest  You don't like doing stuff  I do  I just do different stuff  What was the last  Stuff you did  What do you consider stuff  Anything  You went to a prison  Went to a prison  Yeah you went to a prison  That sounds cool  Right  Fucking  And then there was  That one time  You went for sushi  Columbus  I fucking  When we and Kenny  We were in Columbus  I went and did  Fucking morning press  Yeah  Relaxed  Oh okay  Alright so you're 
[03:23:00]  With the monkeys  Down there on vacation  With the monkeys  That was just part of it  The ship was great  It was the  Norwegian cruise line  Epic  Do you feel the thing moving?  Yeah  So when you're sleeping  And stuff?  Yeah it depends on the weather  Sometimes you don't feel anything  But coming into  I guess like coming into Nassau  A little bumpy  We felt a little  Yeah  It was rocking that night  But you don't really get seasick  That shit is old school  Isn't it? 
[03:23:30]  I do get seasick on boats  If I'm on a  Let's say one of these  Charter fishing boats  Out of Long Island  Or something  Well of course  And it's moving like that  I will get seasick  But on a cruise ship  Never got seasick  Wait wait wait  So you do get seasick  Yeah but not on these cruise ships  They're so big  And just fucking  They have  The shit these things have  I love watching the shows  Sometimes  At night  You're laying around  Even a bad show is good  On a cruise ship right?  Hey why not  Not a show show  A TV show 
[03:24:00]  Oh I thought you meant  You never went to  No I went to some of the shows  Oh boy  Yeah but those are fun  Because they're so bad  That's true  A couple were really good  One I refused  I absolutely refused  To go to  But the  Yes  But the ship itself  All the workings  And gadgetry  That keep it moving  And keep it stable  And stuff  Are really amazing  These modern day cruise ships  Is it crowded?  Not where I was  No I understand that 
[03:24:30]  But when you were just  Kind of wandering around  No it wasn't that bad  It wasn't that bad  I think the economy's  Kept the people down  I'm trying to talk  I'm trying to talk  My girl into going  Just because  We've never been  On you know  A huge cruise ship  I was on a cruise ship  In the Greek islands  But that was a smaller ship  They had nothing  Like what you had going  These are cool as fuck man  They got water slides on them  And rock walls  And all kinds of fucking bullshit  Going on  And then  We were in the villas  Called the villas  And they're the big suites 
[03:25:00]  That are around the bow  Of the ship  Or just over the bridge  And it's  Did Sam get better pictures  So I could follow along?  Yeah I know  Not just dance pictures  Go to the official cruise site  I want to see some pics  The villas  Sam's really terrible  On the computer  How many villas are there?  The ones I had  There were two  And then  There are  A few other ones  Around the perimeter  But then in the middle  Of all these  Is your own private area 
[03:25:30]  That the people  From the villas  Are the only ones  That you can get into  And that's got a pool area  And a bar  And a gym  How many people  Have access to that?  All kinds of other shit  Just the people  That are staying in the villas  So yeah  Around there  Did you have the best suite  On the whole ship?  Yeah there's only two of them  And that was it  That's top of the line  You can't go any higher  Top of the line  How was the gym?  Oh it was wonderful  Jacuzzi and stuff?  I did not go to the gym  Why would you go to the gym?  I know  Keith and Ange 
[03:26:00]  Went to the gym  A couple of days  I was like  You know what  I'm on vacation  My trainer's coming over today  He's going to beat the shit out of me  But I was like  Fuck that  And then the excursions  You're going to start by  Squeezing the alcohol out of you  Yeah  How about that?  Ring me out  It's going to ring you out  And then finally get to your workout  Can you imagine?  It's going to give you  A million bear hugs  Ring me out  Please ring me out  That's the shit  Was there a lot of drinking?  Yes  Some days more than others  Some days I just took 
[03:26:30]  Especially if I was doing  An early excursion  I would try not to drink so much  That's a little crappy room  My god  What are you looking at?  That garbage  Go to the villas  You don't know how to work a computer  You really don't  You villas fool  And uh  Yeah the uh  The excursions were enough exercise  Believe me  We went on some  Some long walking excursions  And shit like that  Uh  And then  Nothing  Is cuter than a dolphin

Before you went away?  Where it's all  It's bullshit 
[03:27:30]  They don't  There's no real interaction  Going on between you  And the dolphins  Yes really  Really?  Yeah  It's the trainer behind you  With the fish  Making it do all this stuff  And I'm thinking  It actually wants to say hi to me  You think it's  It's on it's side  Flipping it's flipper  Yes I wanna think that  That he's actually waving to you  But it just moves  The trainer moves  I pretty much  To make you feel like  I was on to that  You're having a real interaction  With a fucking fish  Yeah  I was  He's not a fish  He's a mammal  He's very intelligent  Is he in the water?

[03:33:00]  The Nassau  Bahamas  Paradise Island  Over there  At Atlantis  That's a huge complex  Got a bunch of different  Sections and stuff  Man made  Cove right  Yeah yeah  Man made  Little cove  Check that out last year  A lot of nice dolphins  In there  And then you do  The whole dolphin  Experience thing  Where you don't  Just stand there  And watch them  Do tricks and stuff  You get to  Actually swim around  With them  They give you these  Little power motor  Little things in your hands  And you go  That's awesome 
[03:33:30]  And you get a snorkel  And the fins  And a mask  And you go around  Under water with them  And touch them  And then you give them  A little kiss like that  You get a picture  Where you give them  A little kiss  You don't like that  I got one of those pictures  Yeah I know  I'll post mine  If you post yours  Then do you get the one  Where you put your arm  On the bottom  And the top of them  And he kind of  Bends up  And smiles  And does that  No my dolphin  Was lazy  No I got a great one  I got the kiss one  I'll tell you one weird thing  Though when you look  When you  Because you know 
[03:34:00]  You think of it as a fish  Because it's kind of  Swimming around in the water  It's got fishy little arms  And a fishy fin on its back  But when you look  At a little dolphin  The dolphin's eyes  It's got that mammal  Thing going on  You know when you look  In the dog's eyes  And it's like  Yeah this thing's thinking  You look in the dolphin's eyes  You're like  He's thinking  You're right  There's stuff going on  You're right  And he flips water  At the trainer  It's like  And then they talk  They go  You throw them fish  They're constantly  Throwing them fish  It's all about the fish  That's how they train them 
[03:34:30]  You can't train them  Without the fish  Of course not  They love that fish  But they let you go  In the cove  Without anybody really  Well there's a  Yeah there's an instructor  There's a trainer  In there with it  And then they  Then they put you on  This like boogie board thing  And you lay out there  In the middle of the cove  And then they go  Okay now put your feet together  And just hold on  You go oh man  And this bottlenose dolphin  Takes his little bottlenose  Tucks it right on your foot  And then just 
[03:35:00]  Wham  Like swims really fucking fast  Heads you right toward a wall  And then  Goes off at the last second  And you just glide slowly in  Oh they trust the dolphins  To do the right thing  Yeah  It's crazy  See that's what you do  You go around with those things  And you swim around  With the dolphins  What's that thing  It's holding on to  It propels you  It's a sea dude  It goes  And then he pulls you through  So you ain't gotta really swim  See Jimmy  You don't do things  Dolphins are faster  There's another thing 
[03:35:30]  You could be doing  What  Fucking watching some chick  I'm with get raped  And a fucking  An animal with an average heart on  Jimmy doesn't do things  No I don't  You know I do  I fucking  I watch Ozzy on YouTube  That's fun to me  That's what I like doing  That's it  Defend  Defend your things  I like to watch Ozzy on YouTube  And fucking videos of  People holding hornets  Other people would rather watch  Their chick getting  Almost raped by a dolphin  Exactly  It was her assault  An assault  Exactly  It was assault  All that dolphin needed 
[03:36:00]  Was a fucking  Sideways baseball hat  Jesus  So that was it  For the dolphins  Yeah the dolphin  Pretty much sums that up  The Mexican one  Was real ghetto  Yeah  And  And the one in Atlantis  And the one in Atlantis  Was good  Hey you walk around Atlantis  Yeah  I was there a little over a year ago  At this point  And it was  A lot of under construction  Oh it's fucking  It's great  They got their shit together again  I went down there for vacation  A few times 
[03:36:30]  And I would absolutely  Go back again  With the adult pool  The cove  Over at the cove  Yeah they call it the cove  The cove  Right right  That area's really nice  No kids allowed  Uncle Paul  Not allowed  I hate the cove  But the rest of the place  Was a little shaky  Really  They were doing a lot of construction  Yeah they were building it up  Is Atlantis Mexico or no  No it's Bahamas  Bahamas  You would like Atlantis  I would  I would definitely go there  Jimmy you would like Atlantis  You're nuts to go to Mexico  I wouldn't go near Mexico right now 
[03:37:00]  I went to  Yeah it was  Fuck that  We took an ATV ride  Through the jungles  Of Mexico  And it was  Like I thought  Alright  This is gonna be  You know ATV  And I heard people going like  Oh ATV sucks  You know you take you on the street  It's this that  Why do ATV suck  Because people were saying like  They take you out  And it's just like  With a guide on the street  And you barely go anywhere  That wasn't this one  I went to the ghetto one also  Where you just go out on the street 
[03:37:30]  What were you doing  One ghetto  One real  Yeah it seemed to be that way  We went through jungles  That were like  And I'm on the bus  As they're taking us out there  And I'm just looking at  Some of these people  Going  You're 500 fucking pounds  You're not gonna be able to do this  And I was right  They're just  Putzing along  So sometimes the guide  Would have to stop  And wait  I'm doing it  And she turns into  Like into some bushes  And then the guide  Has to tell her 
[03:38:00]  How to put it in reverse  And I'm just like  And bumps  That were crazy  I hate going with other people  I was catching what they call  Fat air  Fat air  That's the worst part of excursions  You have to go with other people  Yeah yeah  I hate that more than anything  And these bitches wouldn't shut up  For a second on the bus  They just  And then I was talking to my father  And uh  And he has a tumor  And this was this  And it was  Shut the fuck up for a second  Can I look out the window  At the majesty  Of a fucking rainforest 
[03:38:30]  Without your fat  Fucking face  Just  Just talking  God are they annoying  Ugly American  How long was the bus ride  About  Three minutes  Yeah three minutes  No  It was a good  Over a half hour  Forty minutes  And how many people on the ship  On the ship  There's  Thousands  And thousands  So they gotta just get a bus  For thousands of people  No no no  It's only the people  That want to do this one excursion  Jimmy  Jimmy takes thousands of people  We'll all go on ATV  Sorry you don't have a choice 
[03:39:00]  No there's a shitload of excursions  You can do  Wherever you are  Some people  Some people don't leave the boat  Some people just go to the beach  You sign up for excursions  They got like  Places set up all over the place  This was about a bus  I'd say there were probably  Fifteen people on the bus  Okay  That was it  And they drive us out  Into the middle of this  Fucking  Mayan ruins jungle  And uh  You see the ruins?  Yeah  Cool right  There's some fucking  Yeah  There's like uh  Some graves and shit  That were opened up  And  Yeah 
[03:39:30]  Really twisted stuff  Was it two of you on one ATV  Or each on the road?  Nah separate  You could do two on one  But  The separate  It was  It was so fucking  Treacherous  And bumpy  And like  Ruts and real holes  And rocks that you're going over  See they wouldn't allow  It was fun as fuck  And they don't allow that in America  No no  This is the thing we talk about  You get to do way cooler stuff  When you're out of the country  No it's Mexico  They don't have lawyers involved  Mexico  It's like good luck to you  Here's your ATV  There's a lot of ditches and shit out there  It's like believe me  That's the least that could happen 
[03:40:00]  So  So now you're ATVing  Mayan ruins  ATVing in the jungle  Mayan ruins  Dude  Are you allowed to climb up the ruins?  The ruins  Dude  Yeah you climb up some steps and shit  And you see some rocks  And you're just like  Who put that rock there?  Long time ago  It was a long time ago  Someone put that rock there  Yeah  But do they have the people  Selling all the shit?  No  This is  Dude it's in the middle  This was one of the ones in the middle  Yeah this was one of those  Where there was nothing around  It was  It was really cool  Is there homeless people  Hanging around or anybody? 
[03:40:30]  No not in the  This was the middle of the jungle  I was waiting for a cartel guy  To come out  And just blast us all  That's why you're fucking crazy  To go near Mexico  The Mexican jungle right now  You're in your mind  I know  Believe me  I thought about it  But it was like  Bah what are you going to do?  And then we went to  So what  Is it all just growed in and stuff?  Yeah  There are the trails that you're on  Yeah I got that  But other than that  Yeah there's nothing there  But rainforests  And trees  And big iguanas  Hanging out in the trees  Oh I'm jealous  Fucking iguanas 
[03:41:00]  Did you check out iguanas Jimmy?  No for what?  Fucking ugly lizards  Oh look he's sticking his tongue out  Again  We got it  That's what you do  I'm a fly faggot  What would you rather do  Instead of look at an iguana?  Anything  Anything  Anything  Name a thing  And I would rather do that  Right now  The choices  The world is your oyster  Name anything  Anything  And that fucking trumps iguana  By at least two things  But you do things  I love doing things  Yeah Jimmy does things 
[03:41:30]  I enjoy my life very much  I know  Travel a whole lot  He's got a great life  He does travel a lot  Sure  Constantly gone  He just doesn't want to see an iguana  I have no desire to see a giant fucking lizard  No iguana  No zip lines  No dolphins  And no ATVs  Exactly  And no Mayan ruins  The Mayan ruins I would see  If it wasn't for the fucking fact  That people are being beheaded in Mexico  That's true  That's kind of  Put the fucking kibosh  On Acapulco in Mexico  I took my ATV to go see Sosa  In the jungle  You get off the ATV  And walk around the  Yeah yeah 
[03:42:00]  You go around  Can you go inside some of this shit a little bit  No you just kind of crawl up on them  And stuff  Okay  There wasn't really anywhere to go inside  And then the guy gives you a little history on it  That's awesome  Tells you what it was  This is the Mayan temple  Of love  And fertility  It was used for the  Alright  Come on back to the bumps  Exactly  Stay out  Get some air  In 5,000 years  People are going to be walking through our apartments  How fucking horrible is that  They're going to dock a ship  On fucking  The west side  And people are going to walk through our apartments  Hey this is where  You know 
[03:42:30]  He would have friends come in  Who could have been men in dresses  This is where they would put their big shoes  I love all this shit  None of our business  The ruins  Remember that one  Bobby did  That idiot looking for spirituality  All we were doing  Were chip  And Bobby impressions  Oh good  It's the same thing  It was all  Every time  It was like  What time do we have to come back to the ship  What's that  No  The ship  Stop it  Every fucking two seconds  Look at that 
[03:43:00]  It's a ruin  Who ruined it  Yeah exactly  Mayans  Mayans  Yorans  Who's  Whatever  I don't know  We don't even know who this is no more  Rainforest  All about that  And then  Bobby with the Mayan ruins  Dude  And then  Of course  I guess  Keith and Ann went snooping  Snooba dude  You do your snooba  What is snooping  It's a cross between  Snorkeling and scuba diving  You don't know what this is  No  Bobby went off on this 
[03:43:30]  We ripped the shit out of Bobby  I guess Jimmy was gone  That's probably gone  So when we were  Setting up to do this  No I don't think that's the one he did  Is it  Snooping  What they do is  They have this big  Kind of a flotation device thing  And they put the scuba tanks  On that  And then from that  A bunch of lines come down  Okay  And instead of having a scuba tank  On your back  You breathe through a regulator  From that  Sure  Air source 
[03:44:00]  Right  So you basically  It's like a puppet show  You're all fucking  Yes a marionette  But I didn't do that  I was just snorkeling  With the snooba people  And I had the underwater camera  So I was able to  Take some pictures  Of the  Some video  Of the snooba  Snooba people  Keith and Anjan stuff  And fish  How far down  Can they go on snooping  They were down  About 20 feet  I guess  Somewhere around that  You know  And then with the snorkel though  You can pretty much  Unfortunately  You know  You gotta breathe  So you gotta come back up 
[03:44:30]  But  I was going down  To the same level  As the snooba people  Holding on to shit  Because I didn't have  A weight belt  So I'm like  Grabbing this door  Off the Edmund Fitzgerald  Or whatever the fuck it was  And I have the camera  In one hand  And I'm trying to  Like video a fish  And you kind of get  You kind of get caught up  In the moment  Where you're like  I want to get a good shot  Of that fish  You know  And then you realize  I gotta fucking breathe  And you look up  And go  That's a long way up  You can hold your breath  I wonder if I'm gonna make this  Yeah it's like  And then I get up  And be like  I don't 
[03:45:00]  You gotta blow the snorkel  I got  Just blow it out  Yeah  I can't hold my breath  That long  It was cool  You can tell in the video  When I'm trying to  Get down  Because it gets all shaky  Because it's so hard  To fucking  Push yourself down  And it's work  You know  And you're like  You're not breathing  But you're working  And then you're grabbing  On to something  To keep yourself steadied  So it was pretty  Fucking cool though  Did they bring their kids  Or no  No  Sometimes you gotta do that  You gotta just get away  The ATVs were good  ATVs were good  And then we went to 
[03:45:30]  More ATVs on St. Martin  ATVs  Which  Oh my god  Okay  Good man  Just go  And then you're on the street  You're on the street  On these ATVs  With fucking like  Tractor trailers  In the other lane  Coming past you  This ain't like the jungle  Wow  This isn't like  The fun thing  So where are you  Supposed to go  He takes around  At some shitty beach  Looked like Crab Meadow  On Long Island  It was horrible 
[03:46:00]  You don't like Crab Meadow  I hate Crab Meadow  It stinks of seaweed  Low tide  And there's no waves  It's just these little  Ripples that come up  And then you sit on  This beach for a minute  And then he's like  Alright everybody  Load back up  And you can't really  Get speed up  And shit  I'm trying all kinds  Of things  Like I'm fishtailing  On the street  Just trying to have some fun  And that was your  Second ATV ride  Yeah that was the second one  Oh that's a bummer  Because that takes away  The first one  When that happens  Nah it made me think  Wow that first one  Really rules  It was really cool  Yeah  Yeah the second one 
[03:46:30]  Was just kind of like  Bah  And the ATVs themselves  Were like street legal  And not  They were like knockoffs  The ones we have  For the jungle  Like massive shocks  Sure  And like a  Two foot fucking  Travel on the shocks  And everything  This one it's like  Alright it's meant  For the street  And I think they're  Trying to take the ATVs  Away from the people  Right especially  On Long Island  We could speak locally  I mean they don't  Watch a jet ski  On Long Island anymore  Nah  And I think they're  Trying to make it  Harder to the ATV as well  Yeah and that was 
[03:47:00]  Real ghetto  Because they were  Just taking us  Through the streets  So we were just  Videotaping  Profound poverty  It's amazing  The poverty  In these countries  And all I can think  Is like  This is  Literally paradise  You have beautiful beaches  A lot of land  That isn't developed  And I think  Keith said  This place  Two words  Describe it  Procrastination  And like 
[03:47:30]  Laziness  Or just  Just not  It was  Cinder blocks  It's like  Guys went to work  And said  Let's build something  And he  They put up  Some cinder blocks  And then go  Ah fuck it  And then they go  Let's leave  And by the way  Just leave the truck  There too  Abandonment  That was it  Abandonment  And procrastination  Why would you work  If the beaches  Were so nice though  But that's just it  They could build  These paradises 
[03:48:00]  They live in poverty  What could they build  A fucking resort  Something  No  The big guys  From like America  And Europe  Are doing that  I don't know  And then they're getting  The locals to work there  For no money  Well if the locals  They can't figure that out  Why can't the locals  Figure out how to  Build a resort  Kind of a thing  It doesn't even have to be  A giant resort thing  It could be something  That's more than  Three cinder blocks  And a tin roof  Selling tacos  Isn't it nice to see  That the resorts  Put a little money  Back into the island  Oh god  Doesn't matter 
[03:48:30]  What island you go to  When you are  Off compound  Wow  Yeah you drive  Through the ghettos  To get to the most  Amazing fucking  Resorts  And realize  Whoever owns  Those resorts  Takes their money  With them  Oh they do not  Spread the wealth  On those islands  And you know  Fuck them  They shouldn't  These people live  In what I say  Paradise  You think they're sad though  Oh I've seen  We were passing by  I've seen nothing  But happy locals  When I go on vacation  What is this guy doing  One guy just stood there  And we went by 
[03:49:00]  And he goes  Hey  And he held a fish up  He just goes  Hey  And other people  Are just sitting  On their patios  And porches  Just looking at traffic  Doing nothing  But they're not sad  I couldn't tell  There was no expression  They'd probably  Have it easy  Yeah I'm sure  They're thrilled  To fucking live  In the shit houses  They live in  And watch  Fucking fat tourists  Zip by  On ATVs  Do you get to see  Blue water like that  That's what they get  To see every day  How about you  Build something nice 
[03:49:30]  All they get to see  Is blue water  Blue water's nice  But it's not all  You can see  It gets old  After a while  How about you  Build something nice  They don't know  How to do that  And you use it  To make money  For the island  And yourself  And what have you  You know  That part  Was getting me  Kind of a little  Like Nassau  Right  Nassau  Has a thriving  Little metropolis  That's probably  One block  By one block  And then the rest 
[03:50:00]  Is shit  But that middle part  It's wonderful  They got banks  And the ride  From the airport  To Atlantis  This is  Oh  Wow  Yeah  That should be  An amusement park ride  Bad  Wow  Yeah it's just  Total poverty  Yeah it's  The poverty is  Just astounding  And you know  Of course you got  To show your ID  To get back on the ship  Because I guess  They don't want people  Piling on  Where there's  You know  Hey  It's our food  It's our beer  What are you doing  But it was 
[03:50:30]  All in all  Just a great  Great time  Two fucking weeks  In the Caribbean  I was like a pirate  It's fantastic  You didn't go  Where they are right  Where  You wouldn't know  Where there's pirates  Nah nah  Nah  That's Caribbean  What islands  Did you hit  In two weeks  Do you remember  Oh my god  Give me the  Give me the quick list  Like St. Martin  St. Thomas  Cozumel  Somewhere else  Like Honduras  And then  Nassau 
[03:51:00]  When do they  Take off  Like dinner time  And then  You wake up  Yeah around there  And then you wake up  In another area  Yeah you go  You go there  All day  You spend all day  Like where they stop  And then you get  Back on the ship  And the ship leaves  You have dinner  You go to the casino  You win money  Until the  You know  Last couple of days  That you're on the ship  And then you  You pretty much  Give it all back  Oh really  Oh boy  Did I have a bad 
[03:51:30]  Bad  Couple of days there  I was doing really well  Well you tweeted  The one picture  With the cash  Yeah  I saw that  And I just  Oh there it is  That's a good one  And I shook my head  I'm like  He won that way  Too early in this trip  That's not good  And that wasn't  Near what I won  Really  Oh yeah  That was crazy  You gave most of it back  You gave a lot of it back  Yeah  Yeah  Were you being cranky  At the casino  A couple of times  For the most part  I thought I was doing well  So I wasn't being cranky  They loved me 
[03:52:00]  I was Mr. Anthony  To everybody  And apparently  The casino staff  Are the same people  That work at like  Some of the restaurants  Are the same people  That like do the mustard drill  With the life jacket thing  And the same people  That are out  Showing where the excursions are  So every day  It was like  Hello Mr. Anthony  Hello Mr. Anthony  Mr. Anthony  Mr. Anthony  Everybody  And I'm throwing money around  Like Ralph Cramden  I didn't care  I'm tipping this one  And they treat you  When you tip these motherfuckers 
[03:52:30]  Early on  You are treated  Like royalty  That's the way to do it  So you throw out  A shit load of money  At the beginning  And whatever you need  Like I was able to call  My concierge  And if it was 7 o'clock  I'd be like  I want  Dinner reservation  For 4  At whatever restaurant  I wanted it at  At 8 o'clock  And they're like  Alright  Whatever you need  And then you know  There's a line of people  Waiting to get in  And you're just like  Alright thank you  So now the food on the ships 
[03:53:00]  Is supposed to be pretty good right  Yeah yeah  It's really good  Would they have like  A lot of snacks  All over the place  All over the fucking place  It's snack city  I would love that  And then there's  A shit load  See  Norwegian is different  Than Royal Caribbean  Norwegian's more like  Do what you want to do  Royal Caribbean  Sets up like  The main dining room  And has these  Shifts of  Very elegant dinners  And stuff like that  And then they have  Buffets and other things  This 
[03:53:30]  The Epic had  A shit load  Of great restaurants  You want  Japanese  Topanaki  Or you want  Steakhouse  Italian  Whatever  Chinese  The noodle bar  Fucking  Just a shit load  Of great restaurants  And this is all floating  I know  Sometimes you sit there  And just go like  I don't get it  Sometimes we were  Sitting there  Eating at a  Fine restaurant  And you look around  And go  We're in a boat  In the middle of somewhere  I don't get that  I will never  Get that  It's just the middle  Of the fucking ocean  And you're just  The amenities 
[03:54:00]  Are amazing  Like when you're on a boat  And you're with a bunch of buddies  And you got some rods  And  What?  I had to stop  Maybe you could have put that  In a different way  Three guys on a rowboat  Maybe  You got rods  And you got some bait  Yeah  Jimmy's my Jewish friend  For that commercial  For racism  And I understand  That you're on a boat  Yeah  But when you're looking around  There's a sushi chef  I know  Were you hearing the clinging  Of silverware on China  It doesn't make sense to me  And that  It's just 
[03:54:30]  It was great  Unbelievable  Would a week be enough time?  Yeah  A week  There's plenty of time  You should do a cruise  I've thought of it  But my days have to be used  For other stuff  Oh my god  It was really fucking cool  And the  Like you tip the fucking  Butler guy  Holy shit  Every day  When we came in  From the excursion  Our table  Was set with like  Little sandwiches  And fruit all over the place  And drinks  And whatever the fuck else you want  And then I hosted 
[03:55:00]  A little cocktail party  For all our guests  I was like  Could you please  Concierge  Could you please  Send an invite out  To everybody  And then I went over  With a butler  Yes I need some of this  And that  And I had a little  Cocktail party  For how many people?  I guess it was about  Twelve  Twelve people  Who showed up?  It was everybody  From our party  My aunt and uncle  Mom, dad  Oh you had more family there  Yeah yeah  Dawn, Patrick  Oh  My cousin Anthony  Yeah  We had a lot of people down  Down there 
[03:55:30]  It was a great time  With that many people  It was fun man  So it sounds like fun  Like I would love to do it  For a week  I think two weeks  Would drive me nuts  Yeah two weeks  You could get a lot done  In a week  A fucking first class  Trip week  I would love to try that  Once in my life  Go top of the line  For a week  And you'd fucking love it  Starbucks on the ship  Yeah  Nice  Like it looks like  A regular Starbucks  Yeah  And that's floating  Yeah they got that  Can you get snacks late though?  Anytime  Ooh  Anytime 
[03:56:00]  You want  Isn't it pretty much  All you can eat  On these cruise ships?  Oh fuck yeah  So you're just  Wandering around eating  Whenever you want  There are certain things  That are completely  Do you feel fat right now?  I do feel a little pudgy  I did put on a little  That's why  The trainer's coming over today  To ring you out  Start this  It's gonna ring you out  Start this over again  Yeah  Yeah  Hey what are you gonna say?  Alright well if anything else pops  You gotta let us know  Yeah  I think we covered your cruise  Yeah yeah  Sounds like a great time  Yeah it's just one of those 
[03:56:30]  Fun fucking things  To the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony show  Right here  On Sirius XM  I broke my leg  Jogging with Father Tim  We'd meet at the rectory  Do you know that story?  Mm-hmm  Meet my fucking priest  He's 30  And uh  He was the new priest  And you know  You get introduced  To the new guy  Right  And he's like  He's a 30 year old surfer  That's  Alright what's his problem?  No he had a call  He had a girl 
[03:57:00]  You know he did  Girlfriend stuff  And he went  He was gonna go to college  He used to party  And they used to be  He used to go to like  Burning Man and shit  And there used to be a  Um  Where do monks go?  To the monk place  Yeah  They go to the uh  The uh  The uh  Missionary  Monastery  I don't know  Monastery  If you need the real answer  I like that monk place  Monastery  There's a monastery  And uh  They used to go there  When they were like  Coming down  To like chill out  Before they had to see  Their parents  And then he realized  He was going there 
[03:57:30]  On the way to the party  And not  Then he was staying there  For four days  Not talking  And he had his calling  He had his calling  So I meet him  Excuse me  And uh  I decide to haze  The new guy  Like I'm a  Like a complete  How old are you?  40  I'm a complete jerk  This is recent  This is three years ago  Oh okay  And uh  I just got to  St. Monica's  And it was home for me  But this is why  I go to him  I say  Yeah nice to meet you  Look I want to ask you  A quick question  He goes  What is it? 
[03:58:00]  I go  You know  I've always had a problem  In the Bible  With John 3.16  It says  Those who love  Christ  The Son of God  Shall have everlasting life  And the parenthetical  Of that  Is that  If you don't believe  In Jesus  The Son of God  You don't have  Everlasting life  Like Buddhists  And Taoists  And Muslims  And Jews  Like rabbis  Pray more than I will  Ever pray in my life  Like they're all  Dying in a pit of fire  Because they don't believe  In Jesus  The Son of God  Native Americans  Had no concept  Of the Christ  We put crosses  In the ground  They thought  They were blanket holders  They were like  Hey way to go  Everyone born  Before 7 A.D. 
[03:58:30]  Because he wasn't  Born at zero  Everyone born before Christ  Everyone's dying  In a pit of fire  Except this tiny group  Of people  That's very country clubish  It seems  Exclusionary to me  And he just looked at me  And goes  Yeah bro  I don't know  And I knew I was home  Like I couldn't believe  He wasn't going to  Just go like  This is how it goes  Deal with it  He just goes  Yeah  And then later  He did like  Three funerals that day  That's my biggest question  Right there too  Exactly what you just said  Doesn't make sense 
[03:59:00]  But they're stories  Yeah  And I go  I don't think you're  Supposed to say that here  But I love how he didn't  Bullshit  Yeah  And I knew I was home  I'm like  This is my spot  Yeah  And so Tuesdays and Thursdays  We'd run  And Fridays and Mondays  We'd go to Krav Maga  Like we'd go  Fight together  And I was always  Bummed out  That he didn't  We'd surf together  And I was bummed out  That he didn't wear  His priest collar  Surfing  Because I thought  How cool is that  Like everyone in the water  Is stoned  And you just see a guy  In a priest collar 
[03:59:30]  You don't see the board  You see a guy  Like skimming across the water  With a determined look  On his face  Mass will be full  Right  But people  Wouldn't take him seriously  They would think  Oh look at the idiot  That's making believe  He's a priest  As he's in the water  You know what I mean  Could be  So I'm slashing a Jew's tire  That's the real deal  Now a couple things  We should call him  How old is he now  30, 31  32  Okay  Does he ever talk about pussy  Be honest  No  Or you can't go there  No  He never just talks like a man  No 
[04:00:00]  He's not a man  He's a priest  He had to call  He took a vow  Come on  But the vow  You have to want it  Like you have to see  A little cattle  I'm not going to ask him  Like hey  No no no  I understand  But has he ever let his guard down  Why not  It's the most offensive thing  Do you ever think about sex  That's a very fair question  To ask another man  How big's your cock  I would ask ever  All those things  Is it heavy  No you seem like  To have a relationship  With a guy  So has he ever let his guard down  He had to let his guard down  There isn't a guard to be let down  I don't get that 
[04:00:30]  He's an enlightened  I'm telling  Hey he's full of shit  Have you ever seen him  Have you ever seen  Look  You know me  Have you seen him look at a nice ass  On the beach  Nothing  I'm telling  I say it in my show  When I broke  We were jogging  Up the Santa Monica stairs  And I broke my leg  And I looked down  I was like  Man my fucking leg  Is killing me  And I looked down  I had three kneecaps  And I go  Oh oh  And I go  Father Tim  I broke my leg  And he goes  Whoa that's not good bro  And he just keeps jogging up the steps  Not looking at chicks  I say it in my show  Like there he goes  Just running up the steps  Not looking at chicks 
[04:01:00]  And it's like the place to be seen  And I'm telling you  Is he gay  No  Did he help you with your broken leg  I'm confused  He's not sounding very priestly  I said if Monsignor was here  He would have this straightened out  You are new  And you just said something else  I used to love the Santa Monica stairs  How great is that  I prefer the Santa Monica elevator  Jimmy you don't understand  Dice  I had to lean in and say that  I think Dice turned me on to him  Santa Monica stairs  I don't know  But I don't think he goes all the way up  There's no way he's doing a fucking step 
[04:01:30]  But by the time  Dice is an animal though  He's a cardio animal  That fucking cucksucker  Can literally do a thousand sit-ups in a workout  How many stairs is it?  I forget  It's gotta be 50 right?  By the time you get to the top  You cannot feel your fucking thighs  Right Jay?  Yes  I'm just laughing at Jimmy  Because it's funny  I would hate to have fucking that many steps  You have to go back down  You do more than one too man  You go up and down  You take a break  You take a break when you get back down  I've never spoken to him about that  Stuff at all 
[04:02:00]  Because  You never saw him let his guard down  You're on a beach  There's no guard  Surfing  I swear to you  There is no guard  Marijuana  There is no guard to be lowered  And he's a young guy  He's had a calling  He had a life  And then he had a calling  You really believe you just get the calling?  How could you not  I don't know  But is it a real calling  Or is it something  And again not with him  But in general  Is it something you tell yourself  Is it a real calling  Or does he just want a free car?  Do you believe it? 
[04:02:30]  Or do you think that this guy's looking around  But he's making damn sure  No one sees that he's looking around  No he's not looking around  That's fucked up  And not only do I believe it  I know it  He's looking at somebody's crutch  You think?  You're wrong  I think  You can't not look at him  You're wrong and out of line  You can't not look at  Pussy lips bulging  And want to just fucking make a finger  I'm breaking your balls  And right away you're getting fucking fed  Messed his suit up  Hugging him  Because he's still a man  He's a man of  He's a man of God  Yeah  It's possible  I mean  If I call him right now 
[04:03:00]  Are you going to ask him this stuff?  I would love to ask him  It's a very fair question  Because  Ask him in private  You know I  Oh we don't know who he is  Look I don't know him  He's my priest  If you give me permission  I certainly would  I wouldn't  I would do  No on the air  I'd be careful about it  I wouldn't  To maybe get an answer  But to maybe get an answer about it  Because I don't believe that  How do you  Using a priest  Who we've already established  What church he's at  He works for the fucking Vatican  Let's not forget  He's like  It's a fucking rank and file organization  Look Roland's like  He's uncomfortable 
[04:03:30]  I would have  I would do it with respect  Yeah  Because I'm confused  What about sexual urges  I'm confused by it  The most confusing part of the priesthood  For any guy  Is the sexual urges  How do you  This is what I would do Jay  I go look  That's what makes  Being a priest  A special special thing  Jay  I would do it this way  I go  You're on a beach with Jay Moore  You guys are surfing  There's beautiful girls around  I'm sure  Explain why you're not looking  That's all  I'm sure he's looking  And saying  Wow there's a really beautiful girls  You don't think he gets turned on  You have to 
[04:04:00]  I mean he's a human being  Come on  Yeah right  What do you do with the sexual urges  When you get that  How far do you go with them  Do you wonder what her clit looks like  That's what I would ask  I mean I  I would try to keep it  You know  I would be respectful  I'd go  Do you want to eat her ass  Until the cows come home  I'll do respect  You know that's where we would go to  Of course  Jay would give us a little  Larry in Massachusetts  Larry  Larry who's an animal  You're gonna find your  Your mother's an animal  You're gonna find your  Monsignor dead  The hallway Larry  This guy just called me an animal  Yeah  He can't believe it 
[04:04:30]  Is Larry a good baby name  No it's one of the worst  Yeah that's bad too right  Victor  Gary is also atrocious  Hideous  Picture a baby  You had a picture of him  In the little onesie  With anchors on it  I don't know why  There was a nautical theme  To little boy things  Exactly  Anchors and tugboats  They're masculine  This is my son Gary  Then you gotta change  Victor's diaper  You know my son Larry  Oh look at little Larry  Larry  Larry  All right  The grease that Jay's talking about  I don't know the gentleman 
[04:05:00]  But  Making a  So based on that  Yeah exactly  Making a decision of faith  Is an irrational decision  Right  For you  You're making a decision  No no no wait wait  It's irrational for you  No no no  No he's not criticizing him  I think he's speaking in general  Yeah I'm just trying to understand it  By the way Jay  If you don't make a decision of faith  You're called  We are a called people  All right  Without talking to the guy  I'm not gonna understand this  Is what it comes down to  Can we talk  I apologize  No no no 
[04:05:30]  Not after  What did Larry just say  What if we meant Larry  Go ahead Larry  What if we turned Jimmy's mic off  I wouldn't do that  No Jimmy would be cool  A person who makes a decision of faith  Whether they're called or not  Is immaterial  It's an irrational decision  Now and I'm not saying  It's a bad decision  But the person that made the decision  In hindsight  To them it's the most rational decision  They ever made in their lives  To them it gives them  Total focus  Total dedication  And they're comfortable in their skin 
[04:06:00]  And they're comfortable with their decision  That's why when Jay says  There's no mask  To let down  He's absolutely right  There is no mask to let down  I've always thought that a lot  But how is that irrational  If they have total focus  And total control  How is that  That would make it  A rational decision  I understand that  But if you're  If you make a leap of faith  Faith is belief in things unseen  It is irrational by nature  I think  When the Savior said  To the Apostle 
[04:06:30]  You have seen  And yet not believed  How much more blessed are those  Who have not seen  And have yet believed  He didn't actually say that  He emailed that to Paul  When the whole Corinthians thing  Was happening  Boo  I just wanted to say Corinthians  Go ahead  But that's the point I'm making  Ultimately  Looking at it at face value  Is an irrational decision  Because you make  Yeah  You make a decision 
[04:07:00]  To totally turn your back  On everything you've been  Yeah  And become something  That you have no idea really  Ultimately  What you're getting into  That's marriage  And in eyesight  You look back at the most  Rational decision  Like  Now I'm not trying to  Criticize Opie  But he keeps saying  About the mask  And how he used to do  He has completely  Turned his back  On everything that he was  And become a new creature  In Christ  I think that  I'm just trying to understand  So Larry's pro-priest  Yeah yeah he is  Obviously  But I was confused 
[04:07:30]  By the irrational decision  Let me go back to Jay  Did this guy  Ever get laid before?  Yeah  Before he did  I always wanted that  So  So  Did somebody fuck  Mother Teresa in the throat?  Did one  Why?  She's just a lady  When she was a young chick  Did one guy lay her back  On the bed  And fucking hang her head over it?  Give her a good  Fucking throat yogurt  So now  You guys just fucking  Trolling for another  Suspension?  Why?  You're allowed to say that?  This is actually alright  She's dead  I know now  I know the rules now  Finally  Alright  I don't know  I would say that 
[04:08:00]  Fucked anywhere  I guess we could clean it up  But if the guy  Was having sex  Before he became a priest  That seems like  How do you say that?  I'm asking if he did  I don't know  Okay  But if  Let's say he did  How do you  How do you now  Move on from that?  I don't  I don't understand  Larry  I mean  I don't know  I live with a woman  Who made a decision  Of faith  I live with a fundamentalist  Born again believer  And I understand  How that decision is made 
[04:08:30]  I understand it  That doesn't mean  And it's not for me to make  I don't  My wife or her beliefs  Right  But she is a true  And it works for her  I understand that  And my cousin Ronnie  The pastor  I was sitting next to him  At the balcony of the church  And not paid attention  To the evangelist  When the Holy Spirit  Touched him  And he went down  And made a confession  Of faith  And became a pastor  He did that when he was five  I find that a lot of them 
[04:09:00]  Dude  A lot of them  Are running away  I find  Larry  I think a lot of them  Are running away  From something  Not consciously  But the reason  There's a lot of pedophiles  In the church  Is not because  The church is intrinsically evil  It's because people go there  Thinking it's going to  Save them from themselves  I feel  There's just as many pedophiles  And I'm going to  Stick up for Catholicism here  I think there's  Just as many pedophiles  In temples  In Judaism  The Catholics have got  Believe me  They've earned it  Don't get me wrong  But it's getting the press  But if you're going to tell me 
[04:09:30]  That rabbis  Aren't doing the same thing  And these  Like all these  Fundamental  Baptist preachers  You're born again  Evangelical  Like the Ted Hagerts  Of the world  It's just that the Catholics  There's a deep rooted  Prejudice  Towards Catholics  The Ku Klux Klan  Recruited women  On a strict basis  That you can come in here  And hate Catholics  Because  Their memberships  Were so down  Because people  Weren't really into  Hating on blacks  So much anymore 
[04:10:00]  So the way  The Ku Klux Klan  Got membership  Back up around  A million people  Was hey  The Catholics  Take their orders  From Rome  Which means  They're not real  Americans  That's how it swell  You know how many  Catholics died in World War II  Around 6 million  No no no  But I'm not coming  From that place  The Klan does  What they do  I'm saying  The difference  Between Catholicism  And a lot of them  Is the lack of sex  You're allowed to have  Like rabbis  I think it attracts  Less deviants  Because you can have sex  So I think deviants  Are less likely  To become rabbis  To escape their demons 
[04:10:30]  Because you can have  Sex as a rabbi  I think someone  Whose sexual  Leanings are dangerous  Wants to go someplace  Where they will feel  Saved and safe  And they never have to address it  They never have to address it  That's why I think  You have a higher level  In Catholicism  It's not that Catholics  Are worse people  Or they just know  How to keep it under wraps  I don't think Jimmy's wrong  About that  Okay  I don't think Jimmy's wrong  About that  Because there are so many  Homosexuals in the Catholic Church  That there are seminaries  That are run by homosexuals  They're called pink palaces  And I know that 
[04:11:00]  From a person  Who was attacked  By a priest  As an adult  Going to seminary  And he's so angry at God  About what happened to him  In the seminary  That he can't abide  Any Christian stricture  Of any kind  But the Catholic Church  Is not a pedophile establishment  It's a homosexual establishment  Well maybe there are a lot of  Jesus Christ  Alright we straighten that out then  Alright whatever it is  You know what  Homosexuality a lot of them  I think are running from  I don't think it's a gay establishment 
[04:11:30]  But a lot of them  I think that become priests  Are running away  From that  Because I know guys  That I knew on sober retreats  Who were priests  Who came out of the closet  Let's not let that  Take away from the few  That truly  Are touched by the Spirit  And devote their lives to God  I'm sure there's  Actually a lot more than a few  Catholic charities  Catholics are fucking  A good organization  Catholics start at hospitals  Yeah I'm not saying  They're not good people  Although I said that  Aggressively  The hierarchy of the Catholicism  Though has brought it on themselves 
[04:12:00]  By shipping these guys  From point A to point B  They have brought this wrath  On themselves  By being pigs  And hiding it  And by fucking  Not addressing it  And that Pope right now  You're going to tell me  The Pope is fucking  A heterosexual male  Does anybody look at that Pope  And listen to him talk  And see him in his red shoes  And think he's a straight guy  Of course not  Yeah let's call him  My priest  Come on you can look at a guy  And see that  We would be cool with your priest  I wouldn't be mean to your priest  I wouldn't be disrespectful  You're too  Alright  I'm more respectful than you think 
[04:12:30]  I mean he's got you going back  Right  He was the  Was he the one that got you  Going back to church  No I walked into St. Monica's  And I just  I was overcome  I walked into St. Monica's  Church on a lark  I was in the neighborhood  I walked in  Overcome  I was overcome  And then I went back  And I went back again  And then I found out  After the fact  That's where my wife was baptized  And I was like  Well that's  Incredibly awesome  Like my  My wife as a baby 
[04:13:00]  Was baptized here  By the same guy  That I just watched a mass  And every time I go  It's like they read my file  And exactly  When I was a kid  Church was incredibly boring  Yeah  And I was given a pencil to draw  During church  Because it's like  A complete snore  At St. Monica's  Every time  Every homo  It's all  It's like they read my file  And whatever  I'm going through  For some reason  They just pull some shit  Out of thin air  He might as well be going  Jay  Let me  Let me explain to you  What needs to be done here 
[04:13:30]  I've never  Experienced that in my life  I mean  Every  I'm talking  Every time  I go  Do you have a problem  With the organized religion  Though in general  No I love  I love  Now  I got tired  Of telling people  No but I'm spiritual  And I just put all my chips  What's that  Into Catholicism  Because  I love the structure  And it was the only  Every part of my life  From my old self  To my new self 
[04:14:00]  Had  Had been  Had good structure to it  And kindness  And warmth  And the only thing  Where I was wayward  Was  I believed in  A higher power  And the great electron  In the sky  As Carlin said  That doesn't judge  Doesn't hate  Whoa  Whoa  And I just never  Had a place  With  This is  This is how it goes  And it's a great  You sit next to  Homeless people  There's a gay and lesbian  Stations of the cross  It's a very progressive church 
[04:14:30]  Like Schwarzenegger's there  Joe Torrey's there  Conan O'Brien is there  And there's homeless people  And gay people  And they accept the gays  The sign above the door  Says all are welcome  That's rare  And Monsignor Torgensen  Was almost fired  Because of the amount  Of gays and homeless people  All right well that I like  And he said  The sign  He said all are welcome  How do you get past that  Because that's not really  Accepted in a lot of places  All are welcome  All are welcome  All right  He just stood there  And kept saying all are welcome  They probably made him put  Almost in front of that  Almost all are welcome  A good percentage of you  Are welcome 
[04:15:00]  Five percent can go out  And fuck their mothers  Let's talk to the young priest next  No  You don't trust us  We're friends  We're friends  I would ask very respectful questions  I would too  Like what  Because maybe  Never eat an ass  No I would never do  Like what's the matter with you  I would never do that  I've never done that in an interview  I would say  What do you do with sexual urges  Because they have to happen  And was  Right there  I gotta catch up  Right there  This guy  That's disrespectful  He's a fucking priest  So what  But I don't  How can that guy  Hear people's sexual confessions 
[04:15:30]  And hear without being  No no  I'm not saying  Don't ask him that  If you and him  Are in that room over there  I just  Maybe not ask him over there  Over there  In front of a million fucking people  I think that's a fair  He's representing  An incredible  He's representing  Catholicism  I think that's a great place  Because everybody wants to know that  I think it's a great question  It's not disrespectful  And it's a great place for him to go  You know what  Here's the misconception people have  And here as a man  Is what I do  And here's how I humanize myself  To people who are listening  So a priest is not this  This weird oracle  Who you can't connect to 
[04:16:00]  But a priest is a guy  That made a decision  But he  There's so many  I love this juice  There's so many  People above him  That  Yeah  That's one wrong move  Okay yeah yeah  I mean you  You talk about  Not censorship  But you talk about like  Job security  Towing the company line  Okay  Like hey  Father Tom  We heard you on  This show  Talking about your sexual  Or just like  What were you thinking  And then he's at a  Fucking ice station  In Alaska  Preaching to Inuits  Wernit
