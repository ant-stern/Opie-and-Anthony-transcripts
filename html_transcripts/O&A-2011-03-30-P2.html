<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast featured a chaotic "After ONA Live" segment hosted by Sam Roberts.  The segment began with Opie throwing objects, including a megaphone, at Sam.  This immediately established the tense atmosphere, reflecting the behind-the-scenes dysfunction.  Ron and Fez's interns, Gabe and Brian, were present in the studio, defying instructions to only enter after the main show's talent left.  The discussion centered on a recent meeting where Sam’s hosting abilities were criticized, fueling the ongoing tension between him and Opie.

The main show had several guests.  Colin Quinn, whose upcoming HBO special was discussed, was a guest, as was Tom Papa, who was in the studio discussing Quinn and Broadway.  Brock Lesnar’s appearance, considered a significant booking achievement by Jim Norton, was mentioned.  Norm Macdonald was also a guest, albeit one who arrived late.  The potential arrival of Jerry Weintraub was also briefly discussed.

A significant portion of the segment focused on the bizarre fictional character "Cilantro," Fez's psychic food critic, who was causing problems with the show's publicist.  The situation was so surreal that it apparently led to Anthony offering Cilantro shared living accommodations with his ex-girlfriend.  The segment devolved further into escalating conflict between the interns (Gabe and Brian), Zito (a staff member), and Roland (a producer), marked by insults and accusations.  The number 866-RON-ZERO-FEZ was repeatedly mentioned.  The overall tone was one of considerable tension and unprofessional behavior among the hosts, guests, and staff, showcasing the internal strife within the Opie and Anthony Show's production.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Well, look who's still here. We're live!  And it's After Opie and Anthony Live.  And everyone is still here.  You so suck!  You stink!  Opie is still... Don't throw things at me!  I'm trying to do this!  Opie is throwing things. Anthony is bullying me. 
[00:00:30]  This wasn't even our idea!  This stinks!  There's Ron and Fest!  Opie's talking in the megaphone.  There's people here.  Ron and Fest!  Ron and Fest!  They started at 11.  Get rid of this hack. Opie's just throwing things at me.  Opie threw the megaphone at me.  I didn't know what I totally do.  I didn't know he sat in my seat to do this shit.  Ow! Ow!  That one hit.  That was my...  I totally do. 
[00:01:00]  Totally do.  So how'd you guys like the show today?  What?  The show.  It was great!  You can talk about any of them. They're all on.  I don't want to talk on a mic on your show.  It's our show.  No, it's not.  Opie, where are you going?  It's the Sam Roberts Fuck Dick Show.  That's not what it's called.  There's production and everything.  What is it?  Wait, wait.  What do you do?  I'm usually driving home at this hour.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  And what is this about?  Well, what we do, we talk a little about the show, what was going on behind the scenes.  But we just got done with the show. 
[00:01:30]  What's there to talk about?  Well, we could talk about Jim freaking out.  It's like, oh, people, did you hear that show?  Yeah.  Wow.  There's the show.  Yeah, but everybody's loving that you're on it right now.  No, they're not.  I was done.  I'm going home.  They heard me on the show today.  You've got to be here until 11.  You're doing this with me.  No, I'm going home.  Tell me what happened in the meeting yesterday.  You were there for so long.  I have things to do.  We were talking about this very thing, the 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock show, and I said it  needs a new host.  What?  I said the guy that does it now, I don't even know his name.  He sounds amateuristic. 
[00:02:00]  Me?  That's Sam Roberts is my name.  I said the best part of the show is when he goes, and stick around for Ron and Fez.  Oh, shit.  That's my favorite part.  I love Ronnie Bennington and Fez Watley.  You were in the meeting for an hour yesterday.  That's what you were talking about.  Yeah, because I couldn't say it enough times.  I said it for an hour straight.  It was like a mantra.  No, you don't understand.  No.  I did listen to a couple of things on the way, but the meeting was so late yesterday  that I missed your show completely.  You're probably all bummed out.  But I like it.  I listen to certain things.  I heard the Sarah Jessica Parker thing you played the other day. 
[00:02:30]  Exactly.  Some of the things.  It's very nostalgic.  And these Ron and Fez interns, since when do you guys come in when the talent is still  here?  Oh, look at this.  There's Ron and Fez interns.  Which one are you?  Gabe.  You're Gabe, and which one are you?  Brian.  Gabe and Brian.  Yeah, they're not supposed to come in while the talent is still here, though.  I don't even know.  Do you have any weird nicknames that they give you?  Ron, he's the general.  Because they usually call you something.  Yeah, he's known as the general.  The general?  And what about you?  I have not been lucky enough to get a name yet.  So you're just fucking personality-less. 
[00:03:00]  Who's that guy, I guess?  Oh, shit.  I feel bad for him.  He's got nothing going on.  Oh, I'll get my own car.  How much radio do you want to do?  No more.  What do you mean, a little more?  None more.  No, I'm done.  I just got my parking slip.  I'm out of here, motherfucker.  That's it?  That's it.  How do you think the bracket of your wife?  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez.  No, no, no, no.  Stop calling out 866-RON-ZERO-FEZ.  The highlights are ringing in Iraq.  866-RON-ZERO-FEZ.  866-RON-ZERO-FEZ.  I love the way he says it.  He says it like that.  Call him up.  866-RON-ZERO-FEZ. 
[00:03:30]  866-RON-ZERO-FEZ.  That phone number's not on yet, though.  And by the way, I loved Fezzy's new characters yesterday.  I can't wait until Ron gets here to talk to him about that.  The guy that asks for horrible favors.  Yeah.  That one I see taking off like a rocket.  And then my second favorite, but very close, was the psychic food guy.  How does that guy work now?  It was great.  It was the great cilantro, I think his name was.  Ah, like a spice. 
[00:04:00]  Yes, and he would tell the future of what was going to happen with food.  Like, I see a hair in soup.  Or like it's going to come out burnt or something like that.  Yeah, and he would know.  How does he know these things?  It's a great character, and I didn't even know until after it was done that it was Fez,  because his impressions are spot on.  In fact, who are these guys right outside the studio?  I can't wait.  There's some old guys.  Who is that?  Oh, that's an executive watching me work more than I should, saying,  attaboy.  Yeah, that's good.  Attaboy.  Is your megaphone supposed to rattle? 
[00:04:30]  Because I'll be through it at me.  No, I'll be through it.  I think I might need a new megaphone.  I have your last one in my house.  But you know what?  You know what?  I won't care until tomorrow, because I'm done.  Take it easy, Sam Roberts.  Have fun.  Well, thank you for stopping by.  Ron Zero Fez.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez.  That phone number's not on yet.  Not soon enough.  Well, that's not nice.  This is still technically your name on the show.  After Opiate Anthony Live, you're the Anthony.  Yes.  You know, you could sell it a little.  You don't just have to put me down as Anthony leaves.  Ron and Fez interns.  I thought you guys had been told not to come in while the talents. 
[00:05:00]  We were running out of time.  We need to get this.  What do you mean you're running out of time?  You've got a half an hour left.  It takes you five minutes to set up the studio.  We want everything to be just right, Sam.  Then how come it never is with you guys?  How come it never is?  That's not true.  Stop that.  E-Rock, back me up on that.  Yeah, it's true.  Well, you know what?  I'll defend them a little bit, because it's usually Zito that breaks everything.  Yeah.  Is that true, guys?  I think he's...  Is it you or Zito?  Well, didn't we see Mark break a light?  Mars.  Let's get Mars in here.  Mars.  Yeah, just have him come in. 
[00:05:30]  Mars, tell me the truth about these Ron and Fez interns.  They fuck a lot of shit up, yes?  These interns.  Probably.  I don't know if it's the interns.  I'll be honest with you.  But shit does get fucked up?  After the...  Yes.  That's what I'm asking you.  Yes.  And you think it's what?  The staff, not the interns?  I don't know who it is.  I know that we have a lot of...  They keep me employed.  What type of problems?  Broken headsets.  Really?  That TV gets moved all the time, right, guys?  Who moves it?  The interns?  I don't know.  Does it? 
[00:06:00]  I don't think it's a TV.  Because every time I come in, it's an angle.  I know there was a light incident recently.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because you guys got to be careful because that came off the wall.  I told you it's the interns.  And these guys, Anthony is still standing in here and these interns are walking in.  The talent leaves the studio, then the interns come in.  I mean, Mars, you knew that, right?  Absolutely.  From day one, I knew that.  These interns, I tell you.  Well, Mars, you know, we can't yell at them all day.  We got stuff to do here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  We were blessed with Opie and Anthony's presence.  Anthony, a little longer.  And I was almost put into intensive care by Opie chucking this megaphone at me. 
[00:06:30]  But I think it still works.  Colin Quinn was in today, though.  And Colin Quinn was talking about his show that was his Broadway show,  now going to HBO April 9th.  Long story short, that's a Saturday, so you guys will all be at home anyway.  It'll be on HBO, I think, at 10 p.m. or 9 p.m.  Sometime at night.  A while back, Colin Quinn was in with Tom Papa,  and they were talking about all the different Broadway revivals. 
[00:07:00]  No, Colin wasn't in.  We were just talking about him behind his back?  Yeah.  For no reason.  They were talking about Marriage Ref and what have you, and Seinfeld.  Yeah.  And that Seinfeld is producing or directing Colin's play.  Mm-hmm.  And Tom Papa and Norton started goofing about Colin reviving old Broadway productions.  Well, if you were listening to the show today, you heard Opie and Jim left the show right  before Norton came in to go to the bathroom.  We were following him with a mic.  We'll take a listen to that later.  But first, it's Broadway revivals with Colin Quinn right here on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:07:30]  After Opie and Anthony Live.  We've got to say hi to Tom Papa.  Hi, Tom.  Tom.  We're just at that for the studio.  How are you, sir?  What's going on, Tom?  Doing good?  It's been a while.  Yeah, it has been.  How's your life?  You've been a busy guy.  How's your life?  As you travel around, we're here every day doing the same old shit.  Every day in the same damn room.  Punch in, punch out.  Every day.  This is Groundhog Day for us, man.  It's the same shit every day.  I remember when I did...  Some of the faces changed a little bit, but... 
[00:08:00]  I did Conan when he was here in New York.  Yeah.  And, you know, I was like, hey, well, thanks for having me on the show.  And he's walking around with his guitar after the show, and he said, yeah, this is a big  deal for you, right?  Like, you get to come in, and it's a big day, and now I'm going to go do Conan.  He goes...  And he starts, like, doing, like, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, and he just does this kind of manic thing  on his guitar.  He's like, yeah, go ahead.  Come here.  Do your show.  Then go out about your life.  Do shows.  Travel around the country.  See your family.  I'm here every day in the same four walls. 
[00:08:30]  Every day.  For him, it's just, yeah.  I'm doing Conan tonight.  I am Conan, so I do Conan every night.  Exactly.  Right.  He doesn't have to worry about being on the same four walls anymore.  Yeah, sure.  Different walls.  He moved a couple of times.  Yeah, your wish is my command.  I'll move you everywhere.  I would love a change of scenery.  That would be awesome.  Yeah.  Well, you should change things up in here once in a while.  Oh, really?  We like to have this piece of shit studio.  We don't do it ourselves.  We wait for decay to change things around us, because they don't fix anything or do anything. 
[00:09:00]  So slowly things fall off the wall, and it just gives a different environment.  This is like that show on Discovery, where they show what would happen if humans left  the planet, and how buildings would fall down.  I think that's what they're trying with our studio.  We're doing that in real time.  Yeah.  Anthony makes a great point.  There was something hanging behind him, and that's gone.  God, man.  And then you see a little hoarding thing happening in that corner.  In the corner.  We're watching that area grow out of control.  Yeah.  Soon there'll be a little mold man back there.  Oh, yeah.  And the equipment itself.  There's black mold coming out of these things. 
[00:09:30]  This is like being in a womb after a hysterectomy, if that's where they're done.  I don't even know where those are performed.  In a womb.  Is it okay?  Hey, we've got to get the word out.  The big-time comedy show benefit for Greg Giraldo's family.  You've got Tom Papa, Jim Norton, Dave Attell, Louis Black, Judy Gold, Ted Alexandro, Jesse  Joyce, Colin Quinn, and Jerry Seinfeld.  All in one show.  All coming together for a great cause.  Yeah.  I'm happy Colin's on this gig.  I actually haven't seen Colin in a while since the premiere. 
[00:10:00]  Who has in the basement of the Hellenese Theater every night?  He's a big star.  Yeah, he goes till March 6th.  They extend it to March 6th.  They extend it to another two months.  Yeah.  You think he's sick of it by now?  Yeah.  We've talked to some of these Broadway guys, and it's the same shit.  Every day.  At least we talk about different stuff every day.  He's not talking about different stuff every day.  And he's alone.  And he's just sitting there by himself.  He got extended, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Till March?  I didn't know that.  Yeah, he's a success.  He's a Broadway hit.  That's great.  Look, I'm a big success. 
[00:10:30]  And then eventually they're going to move him to other cities and possibly cross the  pond.  They're going to shoot it for HBO.  Jesus.  And they're going to hold on to that while he goes on tour with it.  And then once he's done with the tour, release it on HBO.  Wow.  Good for fucking Colin.  And then he'll do his next one.  Ah, enough with Colin.  He's gotten every break.  It's rare that I'm literally that happy for somebody.  It's like, of all the comics, we always kind of have like a, we're happy for each other,  but we're not.  But with Colin, I think every comic is happy when he gets something good. 
[00:11:00]  Because it's like, you know, he deserves it.  Everyone knows how good he is.  He's so old now.  Yeah.  And he's so old, he can't do it for that long.  You've still got time to pass him by.  Here's my dream.  Here's my dream.  That Colin shoots the special.  It's nominated for an Emmy.  And the night before the Emmys, he drops dead in his hotel room with a fucking tranny  and a crack pipe.  Long story short.  And he gets it posthumously.  Oh, God.  He's found with his finger in his face. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, would that give me pleasure amidst scandalous stories coming out?  Oh, of course.  Oh, finally successful, and he doesn't get to enjoy it.  All the Broadway stars come to his funeral.  Yeah, they dim the lights on Broadway.  They dim the lights on Broadway.  For Colin.  Al Pacino.  In front of the Helen Hayes Theater.  I know.  They're just, ah, not the whole, we can't dim the whole street.  It's just Colin.  Just dim one at the fucking pizza place.  Just think about what Al Pacino, Al Pacino's show is right across the street from it. 
[00:12:00]  King Lear.  Yeah.  Ah, yeah.  He comes in and has to see Colin Quinn.  What the hell?  Yeah.  How did that happen?  Long story short.  Short is not a jab at me.  Who is this guy?  That doesn't suck for, great for Colin, it sucks for Pacino.  That's right.  Every day Colin walks in, yep, me and Pacino.  As Pacino, you've got to kind of want to think, hey, I've achieved something.  I'm doing King Lear on Broadway. 
[00:12:30]  And then he looks and goes, oh, look who else they give a show to.  Colin Quinn.  Right.  Who is this asshole?  If you worked a day in your life.  Oh.  One of his best performances, right?  Oh, one of the best.  One of the best.  Ricky Romer in, uh.  Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross.  I saw that on Broadway, actually, with Alan Alda.  And I actually preferred Lemon's performance.  He was in it, uh, Liev Schreiber, fucking Jeffrey Tambor, I think, was in it.  It's a weird cast.  Yeah, really.  One of the Dukes of Hazzard, not. 
[00:13:00]  No.  No, Tom Wopat?  Tom Wopat was in it.  The other guy?  Yep.  Tom Wopat was in it.  Tom Wopat.  Oh my lord.  It was good, though.  It was really good on Broadway.  They didn't have Roscoe in there, too?  Yeah.  He's done a lot of Broadway, that guy, right?  Yeah.  Tom Wopat?  Yeah, he's a Broadway guy.  He's like a revival guy.  He does all those, uh, revival, like, Annie, Get Your Gun.  He's always got a hat.  Yeah, yeah.  He's always doing a western dance with a bunch of gay cowboys behind him.  That's right. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, no, no, no, no.  Starring Tom Wopat and Bernadette Peters.  That's got to be some dressing room.  The New York Times calls it the number one revival of the year.  It's Oklahoma.  Now starring Colin Quinn.  Yeah, Oklahoma.  Where the wind comes.  I don't know, something.  He's like one of those guys from South Philly.  When you're a jet, you're a jet all the way.  I guess so.  I guess so.  If you're Dominican, I don't know what the hell. 
[00:14:00]  Like a bunch of Puerto Ricans are going to dance and not stab you.  Colin Quinn in West Side Story.  When you're a jet, I guess.  I guess you're a jet all the way.  White guy.  White girl with a Puerto Rican, of course, has problems.  Right, God forbid we show who's really the problem.  Maria.  Maria.  Where the fucking Maria?  How come Maria had to come?  When both gangs go a little further uptown and they both get their asses kicked. 
[00:14:30]  You know what I mean.  125th Street.  She had to flirt with everybody.  Maria.  Maria.  Get over here.  He is a shithead.  I love how we started off with, that's the one guy I'm really happy for.  Now we're trying to mail cancer to him. 
[00:15:00]  Colin's a bum.  Oh, shit, that's funny.  What do you guys do to a guy you hate, man?  That's what I want to know.  Jesus.  Being attacked by Tom Wolcott.  Wolcott.  Tom Wolcott.  Wolcott.  Oh, God.  Wow.  He's the other guy from Wham!  As far as the hazard went.  Oh, the guy from Bosom.  They're on the Let's Hang Ourselves This Year tour.  The guy from Bosom Buddies.  What did he do to Tom Hanks?  Did Tom Hanks, would he put fucking itchy...  Boy, this better be funny.  Oh, my God.  I wouldn't hold your breath, though, folks. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, no.  All right, let her rip.  I'm just saying, for Hanks to have gone on to such an Oscar-winning career,  and him to have...  I saw him at Starbucks on, like, 72nd Street.  Really?  Bosom Buddies.  Yeah.  The other guy, yeah.  Is he doing Broadway?  Has he done anything?  Was he making lattes?  No, but he should have been.  He was fucking...  Oof.  Oh, that poor bastard.  You could have watched that show back then and just been like,  these guys will just go nowhere.  They're too horrible.  And Tom Hanks ends up, you know... 
[00:16:00]  It's like, wow, he's a real actor.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Yeah, exactly.  And he started off doing just goofy shit.  Oh, and the poor was a buddy guy,  because it's like, he's got to watch him just succeed every year,  get bigger and bigger.  Oh, more and more.  Just holding an Oscar, and you were there going,  I remember we used to come in and go,  hey, we got this show.  This is so cool.  Oh, yeah, me and you, man.  Me and you.  What happened?  It must be so uncomfortable for Tom when he sees him.  Right.  Oh, hey.  Hey.  Oh.  What's going on with you?  Knowing he could help him out, and he never did. 
[00:16:30]  Stop.  Never said, hey, can you help out Peter?  I think his name's Peter, right?  Can't you throw him something out of Peter Scolari?  I think it was Peter Scolari.  I believe so, yeah.  Can't you have him get shot in Private Ryan or something?  Someone in the background getting his head vaporized on the beach?  Well, I would, but it's not up to me.  The producers, you know.  I'm only a double Oscar winner.  I have no pull.  I have no pull in this business.  Stop by the castle sometime.  What are you doing?  What about Apollo 13?  Aren't you producing that?  Yeah, but producing, it's really just a title. 
[00:17:00]  It's not casting, but casting people.  Yeah.  You know, once you get this far, it's out of your hands, man.  Remember when our bras got mixed up that time?  That was fun.  I got to go.  You know when he sees Hanks, he just wants to go, look, help me.  Help me.  For Christ's sake, help me.  Don't even put me in anything.  Just give me some money.  Just write a check right now.  Just give me a bag of money.  I don't care.  No way.  I bet he's grabbed Tom Hanks' lapels at least once, but not angrily, just out of desperation.  Like, yeah, it's all right. 
[00:17:30]  Tom's like, you doing some theater?  He's like, yeah.  Tom, time's the top.  He just grabs it.  Tom, I need work.  Tom, I'll do anything.  But he's so short, he's on his toes grabbing.  I'll suck your dick, man.  Oh, God.  This week in Branson, Missouri, Peter Scolari.  In long story short.  Long story short.  Colin Franchard.  Colin decides to retire.  Peter Scolari's taking it.  The other bosom buddy wasn't available.  I want the other fucking bosom buddy. 
[00:18:00]  I just want to slap Colin's face.  He can't even climb up the stairs.  You know what's humiliating is that we're here destroying his career, and he has so much  a better career than I do.  Oh, completely.  Like two series.  But you didn't work with Tom Hanks.  That's true.  Right, exactly.  You worked with Colin.  That's the thing that kills us.  Yeah, you worked with Colin.  You guys are neck and neck.  Look, you know, we've come full circle.  After O&A. 
[00:18:30]  Live.  That's what it is.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  The studio has started to calm down somewhat when we started After Opie and Anthony Live.  Everybody was still here.  It was a madhouse today towards the end of the show.  That was Tom Papa, that last clip, Tom Papa in studio, talking about Colin Quinn and all  the different Broadway revivals.  Colin Quinn was in today, rolling the first of many guests.  Yes.  The show kind of started, you know, slowly.  Not content-wise, but guest-wise. 
[00:19:00]  It built up.  In your world.  Yeah.  And then it built up.  You had Colin Quinn coming at eight.  You had Norm, we thought, coming at nine.  Yes.  Not so much.  Not so much.  He was late.  Brock Lesnar was late.  The two ended up conflicting with each other, but it turned out okay.  It turned out fantastic.  And Jimmy Spaz is just up.  But, you know, Jim was very excited about Brock Lesnar coming in.  He's a huge MMA star.  He doesn't do very much press.  Very much.  And we really had to pull a lot of strings to get him in here. 
[00:19:30]  We really appreciate him coming in here.  And he was a great guest.  I mean, you're a guy who sees every guest.  Yes.  So you know when somebody's a good guest or a bad guest.  Yeah.  What do you say about Brock?  He seemed like a really good guest.  I was just talking to his lawyer and publicist, so.  Do they seem, I came in.  They were very happy, and he's coming back to the show in June.  He is going to come back.  June for the book.  I was glad that the thing went well, that the interview went well, because I asked him  to sign my wrestling chair at the end of it.  And you could tell that under normal circumstances, probably not.  He's out of that world. 
[00:20:00]  Not a chance in hell.  Yeah, okay.  Okay.  I wasn't going to be so...  But he had such a good time.  You know, he knew that Jim was such a big fan.  He said, okay, he signed it.  It was a beautiful thing.  But as all this chaos was going on, Opie and Jim left the show right before...  As Norm was coming in, you walked Norm in.  I saw, we were in the corner, Norm goes, hey guys!  And they're like, we'll be back.  Norm?  And then he thought they were on commercial.  But I said, no, we're live. 
[00:20:30]  He goes, oh!  So you, you walked in, you saw him when it was just him and Anton here, right?  Yes.  And Colin.  And Colin, of course.  I don't know, how did that go?  I followed Opie and Jim to the bathroom.  He thought we were off there, so he was just like catching up with Colin.  But there's, I mean, it probably made it to a good show.  It did.  Well, I followed Opie and Jim into the bathroom and decided to turn the recorder on and get some comments.  You guys are missing Norm.  Well, more importantly, you just caught me and Jimmy actually peeing right next to each other, breaking the mail cone. 
[00:21:00]  Because as you see, there were empty urinals, but we decided we needed to pee right next to each other today.  Yeah, well, we're running in.  I said hello to Norm in the hallway.  And we're going to run in and see him right now.  Show in progress.  I brought my stuff up, you too.  Yeah.  Jim, you brought your Brock Lesnar stuff into the bathroom with you.  Is that because you were afraid Colin would fuss with it?  No, because I knew Colin would fuss with it.  Fuss with it.  Sorry, Nana.  You nervous about Brock?  No, I just don't want Colin. 
[00:21:30]  I'm actually not.  I just don't want Colin touching my stuff with his fucking thin fingers.  Opie, you got to go.  The show's on.  This could be the longest pee ever.  Jimmy's already done and I'm still peeing.  Also, I got a video maybe later that'll go up on my YouTube channel.  Colin Quinn throwing Jimmy's MMA gloves that he wanted Brock Lesnar to sign into the garbage.  It's classic.  You're plugging and pissing at the same time.  I'm the king of this shit.  I'm the king of plugging and peeing at the same time.  What else is going on, Sam? 
[00:22:00]  Well, the show.  I mean, I'm kind of worried about the show right now.  Ah, it's on autopilot.  I don't think we have autopilot.  It's fine.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Hey.  And then he ran all the way back up the hallway to rejoin the show where Norm had already started  his interview.  But, I mean, we were all kind of busy in here making the transition from Norm to Brock.  Did Norm have a good time?  Yeah, he had a great time.  He wants to come back.  I'm sure we'll have him back because he was hilarious.  Yeah.  Do you follow him on Twitter, Roland? 
[00:22:30]  I do.  You like the tweets?  I do.  Why don't you tweet more often?  I do tweet.  Not that often, though.  I do.  Just nobody pays attention.  All right.  Well, what's your Twitter name?  I don't know.  I think Rolando's 99.  But you're not sure.  I'm not sure.  Hey, Ron and Fezzin intern, how come I'm getting surrounded in banners right now?  What's the deal here?  What's going on?  Well, apparently now we have three banners that we have to hang up to cover that.  To cover what?  You understand we're on the radio, right?  Oh, yeah.  No, yeah.  Okay.  No, I just wanted to tell you.  I thought it was to cover the garbage cans there. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  But Zito made it sound very clear that he wanted to cover the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, that's good.  I mean, that makes sense because you want Ron and Fezz to be represented.  There's also one over there, so.  But right next to you.  That probably won't film over here, I wouldn't think.  Maybe he wants to take a shot at Fezz.  I don't know.  What the hell?  Roland, what's this guy's deal?  I don't know.  I'm not looking his way.  He scares me.  You don't like him?  He's just staring straight at you.  D-Rod, what do you think of this guy?  I'm just watching Zito in here stewing over these comments. 
[00:23:30]  He hates him.  Zito hates me?  Yeah, he hates you.  He says he doesn't care.  But is that passive-aggressive don't care?  Zito and your intern.  Oh, shoot!  No!  No!  You know what that music means.  When the glass shatters...  Where is Lesnar?  No!  Is he still here, seriously?  He's not here.  You can say whatever you want.  What about Norm Macdonald?  Is he here?  Is there anybody?  Norm Macdonald took off, too. 
[00:24:00]  But your intern and Zito were about to get into a big fight, apparently, according to  E-Rock.  E-Rock said that Zito was stewing over some comments that your intern just made.  Brian?  Yeah.  Brian is the fucking future.  Look at this kid.  He basically looks like an ad right now, doesn't he?  Yeah.  Some kind of extreme clothing line.  Yeah, he's got his winter hat on with the brim on the back.  What happened with you and Zito?  Well, I don't know.  Sam just asked me why I was...  Why I was getting surrounded in banners right now.  And I said Zito asked me to put up three banners instead of two. 
[00:24:30]  And Zito made it very clear that he wanted this opening to Anthony, specifically this  sign right here, to be covered.  Oh!  Oh, shit!  Okay.  Oh, shit!  And Zito?  Well, let me tell you something before we even get into Zito.  For sure.  I am...  I'm like fucking Hitler.  I got battles on so many fronts right now, and always because of my guys.  What other battles?  The Washington video guys hate us.  Why?  Zito won't get things signed off.  Oh.  The releases?  Fez believes that Roland has poisoned his name all over the building. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, I saw some of that back and forth between you and Roland yesterday.  But that was a me, though.  All the stories were traced, Roland.  You can't get away with this.  I am innocent.  The lies are being spewed.  So I was in five meetings yesterday.  For you?  You don't do meetings.  You're not a meeting guy.  When I say meetings, I'm walking around, everybody's going, hey, if you take care of  this, I'm going to do it this one time.  Right.  Instead of my guys.  That's the me.  Before you got Anthony started the show with us today. 
[00:25:30]  I've already heard about this because my text blew up as I was walking in here today that  Ant was ready for the show to start and was a big fan of the characters.  Loves Fez's characters.  Yeah.  The number one character in the Kumia household right now is this psychic chef.  Uh, cilantro or something like that?  Cilantro, he said.  Yeah.  Um.  He also really liked, uh, asks for inconvenient favors guy.  Yeah.  I forgot.  I think that guy's name was Daryl or something.  That's right.  Uh, Ant, we understand what the people want. 
[00:26:00]  By the way, this is very interesting.  What's that?  I am being, uh, being texted by one of Anthony's lovely exes.  Oh my goodness.  Who says she's here at Sirius.  Tell her to come in.  I asked, I said, oh, stop by.  And she says it'd be right there.  I have to pee pee.  So.  She's using Roland language.  She is.  We're all children.  Um.  Is everything okay between your intern and Zito?  I just want to make sure that's cool.  Nothing's okay with, see, the only way Zito's going to get mic time is on your fucking in-between show. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, he doesn't do, well, you say the word, he doesn't do, I mean, this is right now, it's, uh.  This is Ronnie and Sammy Sweetheart.  So you say the word, I'm not going to go behind your back.  Well, it's very fucking interesting, but even right away, I have to hear an insult against  someone, hey, as soon as I come in.  I can't fucking rest a second.  No.  You don't want this negative energy surrounding you.  I got fucking Roland playing a fucking role with somebody ready to throw a knife in someone's  back.  I don't know what's going on, Roland.  You know what I mean? 
[00:27:00]  I don't get into it all.  I'm very good friends with someone who's stopping in here today, Mr. Jerry Weintraub.  He's my, one of my heroes growing up.  He's everybody's hero.  Jerry Weintraub presents, Jerry Weintraub presents Elvis, Jerry Weintraub presents Frank Sinatra,  George Clooney, and the Ocean's, Ocean's 11th crew.  And he's going to be in here?  He's going to be in here.  I met him, he's in the hallway.  I guess me, Jerry Weintraub, and one of Anthony's many lovely exes.  And Fez.  And Fez.  I forgot.  Well, I don't call him Fez anymore because that's one of these lesser characters. 
[00:27:30]  So we don't know who's going to be stopping by.  I hope it's Cilantro.  It could be Cilantro, the psychic chef.  The psychic guy who asked for a lot of things.  Dave already feels a little nervous about the new characters because it seems like Fez  has fallen into Dave's zone.  Right, because Dave always did characters, but he never had a guy who asked for inconvenient  favors.  Well, that was Dave.  That's just Dave.  So there's a lot of stuff going on.  Now, I don't know if this is the ex that was stalking, Anthony. 
[00:28:00]  I'm not sure which one it is.  You don't have him labeled?  No, I don't know.  I know that you said with the voicemail girl that you were going to try to get in touch  with.  She'd be perfect for me.  Yeah.  That's somebody you were looking for.  Well, I hope for all of our sakes that that's not the person who's stopping by.  Maybe me and Jerry Weintraub can tag team or on our next Jerry Weintraub presents.  Are you going to do the Jerry Weintraub voice for the whole time he's in here?  I just saw Roland texting, Ron's bothering Jerry Weintraub. 
[00:28:30]  Roland, what is this?  Because I've heard that.  It happens.  Is there something?  What?  Are you talking about people?  No.  Are there people bothering people?  It's not like I'm saying Dave, podcast, locations.  Here's the thing.  What?  Roland, first of all, he doesn't like Dave.  No, he doesn't.  He doesn't like Dave.  Now he doesn't like Cilantro, my partner.  What's your problem with Cilantro?  Now, here's what I'm basically worrying about.  Does this mean Roland doesn't like me? 
[00:29:00]  You know what I mean?  Because he doesn't like the people in my life.  He hated Zito.  He made Zito's life a living hell as he showed up.  Yeah.  Now Zito and Brian are fighting, the intern.  See, this is something you guys wouldn't understand.  An intern.  It's something you guys don't have.  You mean staffer?  Yeah.  He's here on an internship.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Does that mean like producer or?  No, it's something.  I guess you guys don't have it in the morning.  We don't know what that is.  Yeah.  No.  Do you have issues with my partner, Ronnie? 
[00:29:30]  No.  No.  I love Cilantro.  Oh.  It's just when Cilantro puts a bad ingredient and makes the publicist mad.  Oh.  Oh, Cilantro.  Cilantro swore to me that the publicist was fine until.  Until when he walked away and then he calls me over and goes.  Oh, boy.  That's not words.  Yeah.  Were you talking to a publicist or a dog?  I told Cilantro to stay away from you and all your business.  But it wasn't just me, though. 
[00:30:00]  Uh-oh.  I know it's not just you because you've gone up and down the halls rolling.  I had to talk to people from every fucking department about this.  I said it doesn't seem to be as big a deal as everyone's making it out to be.  Everyone likes Cilantro.  I always thought so.  Now, here you got Ant.  He's a comic genius.  Yeah.  He would never want to be.  He loves Cilantro.  Yeah.  At one point, Ant and one of his lovely exes offered Cilantro to move in with them. 
[00:30:30]  Really?  Yeah.  That's probably because he's sitting there cooking and saying,  I don't know if this is going to be well done until I'm all finished.  Whereas Cilantro, he'd let you know right when you started.  Right from the beginning.  He's like a fucking architect of food.  It's incredible.  I honestly think we need to send you one of those classes where you learn to depend on other people  and get along with people at work, like you're climbing up fucking cliffs.  Where you fall back and everybody catches you.  Yeah, I don't want to do that, though.  Seriously, I would love to do that with you, Roland, because I think you're an adorable guy.  But it seems like there's a poison to you. 
[00:31:00]  A poison.  To be honest, there is a venomous side to Roland, correct?  No.  No?  I love Cilantro.  Is there a lying side to Roland?  There's no venom in you?  Possibly.  Why don't you do this?  Spend today fixing everything you poisoned yesterday and go around and tell people Fez isn't out to hurt.  Because his feelings really got hurt.  Oh, Cilantro's feelings got hurt.  He couldn't have seen that coming.  No.  He's not a sensitive guy normally. 
[00:31:30]  This is a story for God.  My feelings got hurt, too.  Why would your feelings get hurt?  My ears had to listen to somebody yelling at me.  He's talking about the publicist, not Cilantro.  Well, I'll have Jerry Weintraub call the publicist.  I understand there's some kind of problem with a guy named Cilantro.  No, Cilantro.  We've got to get to Cilantro.  I'll have your whole family killed.  Jerry Weintraub.  You're taking me to have another.  We're taking Jerry Weintraub and Cilantro's time right now.  This has been Ronnie and Sammy Sweetheart. 
[00:32:00]  Stay tuned.  Ron and Cilantro is coming up next.  The O.P. and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash O.P. and Anthony.  And catch O.P. and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  On the virus. </pre>
