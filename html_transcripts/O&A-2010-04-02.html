<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with hosts E-Rock and Sam Roberts engaging in a segment focused on “Liquid Ass,” a foul-smelling spray.  They recounted past pranks involving the product, leading to a challenge where E-Rock, despite initial hesitation and safety concerns, tasted a drop, immediately vomiting afterwards.

The show then transitioned to a segment reviewing the website “Am I Gay?”, with studio guest Bob Kelly.  Listeners’ questions detailing various sexual encounters and fantasies were read and discussed, prompting crude and humorous commentary from the hosts and Kelly regarding the definition and interpretation of homosexual and bisexual behaviors.  One particularly noteworthy call described a father-in-law performing oral sex and anal massage on his son-in-law during a fishing trip.

Next, Opie and Anthony, along with in-studio comedian Joe DeRosa, hosted a call-in segment about how the show had negatively impacted listeners’ lives.  Callers described how the show had “ruined” various aspects of their lives, from movies and music to relationships and everyday activities.  The segment heavily featured crude jokes, offensive language, and graphic sexual descriptions, with significant time devoted to ribbing Anthony's recent hair transplant.  A surprising and lengthy call with Sam's father added to the vulgar humor, revealing eccentric habits and sexually suggestive comments.

The show continued with a segment about the Dilbert comic strip, specifically Dilbert getting fired.  In-studio guests Otto Peterson and Sam Roberts joined the hosts and studio audience in a contest to create funny (and offensive) punchlines for the comic, utilizing sexually explicit and crude humor. This transitioned into a discussion about E-Rock crying during a Futurama episode, prompting further discussion about emotionally affecting television shows.  Audio clips from both the Dilbert comic and the Futurama episode were played.

The Futurama episode about Fry's dog waiting millennia became the focus of the next segment. Callers debated the emotional impact of the episode, ranging from tears to anger, while the discussion veered into tangents about other emotionally charged movies, personal pet experiences, and a story about a dog's death possibly caused by a kick to the liver.  A long call with Bob Gale, co-writer of *Back to the Future*, followed, detailing the film's creation, casting choices (including the replacement of Eric Stoltz), rejection by Disney, and script development.  The segment featured numerous callers, including E-Rock and the show's intern, Paul.

The final segment centered on *Back to the Future*, with a guest answering questions about the film's production, including set fires, film vaults, the Universal Studios ride, deleted scenes, and time travel paradoxes. This led to a discussion of various infomercials, including "Cheers to You," "Finally Fast," "Six Hour Power," and the "Slap Chop," with the hosts and guest making numerous crude jokes and offensive comments about the products and their marketing.  The "Slap Chop" guy, the "Sham Wow" guy, and Columbia House record club were also discussed,  with frequent use of vulgar and offensive language throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  EXAM  Hello, this is Steve Austin.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony's.  Fuck.  It's going to be one of those days.  Here we go.  Hey, this is Steve Austin.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony's show, 
[00:00:30]  hosted by primetime Sam Roberts.  Roberts.  Fucker.  Hello, this is Steve Austin.  You're listening to the worst.  Hey, this is Steve Austin.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony's show,  hosted by primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock.  I need this closer.  Is it good there?  It's fine right there.  Okay, you got it.  I don't even think those headphones work, so.  Oh, okay.  I just want to look the part.  Yeah.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with E-Rock and Sam. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  I switched around.  You know, Sam, for a short period, the show was fascinated with this product called Liquid  Ass.  It was a spray or, well, I mean, I guess it was a liquid.  It came in spray bottles and, like, eyedropper bottles that even a tiny little bit would  just fill the room with a stench, unlike many others.  Now, we used to test this out on former intern David a lot.  Yes.  Well, even off the air, I would just spray it on his clothes. 
[00:01:30]  And in his bag.  In his bag.  And that little trapper keeper he used to walk around with.  Our goal was to make sure that he smelled like shit wherever he went.  And, well, you know, we were tired of the smell and we thought we've done everything  we could with it.  So, we figured, if it smells bad, it must taste bad.  So, who gets to taste it?  You do.  That would be correct.  And, uh, I'm trying to remember how it tastes.  You know what?  I'm not even going to go back and think about it.  We'll let you listen to it.  Yeah, I'm sure you describe it very well. 
[00:02:00]  It's E-Rock tasting Liquid Ass.  All right.  Enough of this.  I can't take it.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On the Virus, Sirius XM.  Pat in Tennessee.  Pat.  Good evening.  Good evening, Pat.  What's up?  What about getting E-Rock to gargle some of that ass spray shit?  Nah, it might get him, it might get, uh, the spray sick.  Nah, it might get E-Rock sick.  We can't do that.  What's the worst that could happen?  He'd lose more weight?  E-Rock, will you put a few of those on, a few drops on your tongue?  If it's safe?  No. 
[00:02:30]  If it's safe?  No.  Of course it's not safe.  How do you know?  Let's look at the packaging.  Is it safe?  Yes.  I'm so safe, I would believe it.  They have to have, dude, a fine company like Liquid Ass, they would keep it safe.  Of course.  I mean, if you're trading this on, uh, you know, down there on Wall Street, what do you  got, Sam, on the Liquid Ass?  I think it's safe.  It just says, do not ingest, if accidentally ingested, drink two glasses of water.  Ah. 
[00:03:00]  So we'll just get some water.  That's, no, they would say, don't, make sure you, yeah, you can do this.  You don't even have to call poison control.  Dude, two drops to your tongue.  No.  Two lousy drops.  Two lousy drops.  Two lousy drops.  Or what if you put it on your tongue and then spit it out?  No.  Come on, E-Rock.  I tell you this, the tongue may dilute it, though.  I don't mean the drops, sweetheart.  We'll have water standing by.  Two lousy drops. 
[00:03:30]  Two lousy.  We finally found something you won't do for the show.  No, I won't do that.  What if he just licks the part that it comes out of?  Ugh.  It's just the residues.  That's hot.  How about if he sprays it on his wristlet perfume and then applies it to his neck?  I don't want to fucking smell anymore of this shit.  I understand.  I don't either, but, you know, we've got to give the people something out there.  I'm thinking two lousy drops.  E-Rock. 
[00:04:00]  Not to the mouth.  What?  Not.  Putting that stuff in my mouth.  Just like you stick your tongue out, Sam, drop, drop, that's it.  And then we watch you lose your fucking mind.  Wouldn't that be great to just put it on your dick and go to a hooker?  It would be better, yeah.  Tell it to give you a head and have her just smell.  Dude, he's thinking about it, though.  I've known E-Rock long enough to know that he's at least thinking it over in his head.  Why not one lousy drop? 
[00:04:30]  How about?  One lousy drop.  We'll start there.  Because I'm worried about ingesting it.  That's the problem.  Well, we have water standing by.  Look at the label.  Sam, read the label again, please.  Okay, it just says, do not ingest.  If accidentally ingested, drink two glasses of water.  That's it.  It's purposely ingested.  That's it.  Drink three glasses.  I don't know.  And they probably mean if you take, like, a shot of it.  Yeah.  One drop.  If you just went, drop on your tongue, smushed around your mouth, then go, spit it out.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Then you just have the shitty smell in your mouth.  This is a reputable company.  Any day of the week.  Kidding.  That's not necessary.  One lousy drop.  Always thinking about it.  God, I love this kid.  I love this kid.  You can't say none taken.  I know.  I don't know why I can do that.  Get the video camera.  I don't trust anyone to put that in my mouth.  I will allow you to do your own drop.  It's got to be safe.  But we all will look and go, okay, that was fair. 
[00:05:30]  It's got to be safe.  Everyone has done the eyedrop thing, so you pull your tongue out and give yourself a drop.  Water standing by.  Video camera standing by.  Cox out.  Okay, I'm in.  Oh, my God.  Here he goes.  All right.  Sam is running for the video camera.  This will be part of the E-Rock video series. 
[00:06:00]  I mean, you did the Cinnamon Challenge.  This is nothing compared to that.  They wouldn't possibly have a product where you could, like, you know, have a real medical issue.  It would all sense of taste.  Hey, get, uh, E-Rock plenty of water.  And don't take the water away from him.  We gotta, we gotta play this safe.  That's the dropper.  Okay.  Can I have the, those two?  Thank you.  Yeah.  You want to do it in front of the audience?  Yes.  Well, do you think, hold on.  Eric, Eric, do you want to hold the water, or do you want, uh, Richard Dreyfuss from Jaws to hold it for you?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:06:30]  All right, E-Rock is a real trooper today.  E-Rock, they gotta see you out there.  Yeah, let's see.  We get the visual bits for the people that are, they're all guys.  We do, we do it for, oh, he just smells, but he's not happy.  Is it bad, Eric?  How bad is it?  How bad is that?  It smelled worse, but 
[00:07:00]  when you first open it, it's like  when you check on a diaper.  Yeah.  Alright.  You want to do it in front of the crowd, E-Rock?  No, screw them.  Oh, come on.  We need the audio, sweetie.  Your fans were waiting.  Of the crowd going,  I'll go over there with you.  Give me a mic.  I need headphones, though.  Yeah.  Head. 
[00:07:30]  This asshole will go.  Alright.  E-Rock, everybody.  One  lousy drop.  E-Rock's got the liquid ass.  Liquid ass smells  so fucking bad.  Alright? I don't understand.  Wait, wait.  Let some of the audience smell the liquid ass  that haven't smelled it yet.  Just so they understand  what the fuck is about to happen here.  Who wants to smell this? 
[00:08:00]  No one.  No, they don't have a choice.  They won't put it...  Don't put it on anybody.  I'm not.  Oh, there's a lady here.  He won't spray it on you.  I won't put it on you.  Just smell it.  Yeah, this stuff is  really, really rancid.  Alright, E-Rock.  Can you just get out of my way?  I'm not...  No, no, no.  It's okay.  Not yet.  When Sweetie probably  fucking mopes back in.  I have no idea  where the camera is.  Alright.  E-Rock.  What are we working on? 
[00:08:30]  A nice drop to the tongue.  Oh, it's bubbling.  Oh, it's bubbling.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  It's got to be a good one, too.  Alright, pull your tongue out.  Like, hold your tongue.  No, hold it.  Exactly.  Hold it.  He's hurting on someone's hand.  Pull the tongue out.  Alright.  Jimmy, is he doing it?  Tell me when I'm over my tongue. 
[00:09:00]  Well, you can't figure that out?  Stick it out.  One lousy drop to the tongue.  E-Rock.  It has entered.  That's a face.  He's not happy. 
[00:09:30]  He's not happy.  There he goes.  His face is beet red.  Holy shit.  You didn't swallow it, did you?  He just puked all over the place.  Oh, I hate this.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  He's redder than the cinnamon challenge.  For the people that linger longer with it.  That was one drop.  He's puking all over. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, the heavy rock.  Holy shit.  I'm all wet.  You all right?  Yeah.  Is the taste still in your mouth?  He boofed so bad.  Is the taste still in your mouth?  Dude, what was it that really got you to puke like that and freak out? 
[00:10:30]  The taste or the smell in your nose?  Is it unpleasant?  Yes.  I pulled my tongue in too fast, and it hit, I guess, the rest of the saliva that's in  my mouth.  And then I smelt it, and I lost it.  Oh, is that fantastic? 
[00:11:00]  Try drinking some more water.  One more drop.  For the audience, it's like watching Shamu.  Only smaller.  Oh, bigger shit.  Oh.  God, I suck.  I blew that joke.  You were right there with Radio Gold.  I had a good tag and everything.  Now he's smaller.  I fucked it up. 
[00:11:30]  Of course, he's smaller.  Oh, I suck.  If I wanted Shamu, only it's a person, not a whale.  Boom.  Oh, did I suck?  Let's hear it for E-Rock.  Holy shit.  Let's hear it, E-Rock.  God damn.  I had a 50-50 shot of getting that right.  Oh, my God.  I fucked it up.  Only smaller.  Nice, E-Rock.  Good joke. 
[00:12:00]  My tag was fucking right into the wall.  It sucked.  Shit.  Oh.  That made me happy.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Let me drink this water.  It's like the ocean, only smaller.  Holy shit.  What a complete dick bag.  It was...  After that came out, it's unsalvageable.  Because there's no way I meant bigger than that.  I know.  We know.  I know.  Everyone knew what I meant.  Oh, that's fucking how it is. 
[00:12:30]  Dummy I am.  E-Rock, how's it...  Perhaps smaller than...  Perhaps smaller than the whale.  E-Rock, how's it feel?  Oh, great.  Yeah?  Yeah, there's no taste in my mouth.  But other than that, it's fine.  You still got the taste of shit in your mouth?  No, it's gone, but I can't taste anything else, either.  Really?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's say hi to Footer.  Uh, Footer.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Yeah, I'm sure because of Eric's gums and that shit, he probably comes out smelling like  scope right now.  Some weird fucking thing will happen.  And then number second point is...  Number second point?  Wow.  What a retard day.  A. 
[00:13:30]  Number second point.  Number second point.  Wow.  Wow.  If I'm being literal, like Anthony, that'll be a little more funny.  Check it out.  Listen to this.  You guys just got through the whole Danny thing.  And now, once again, you self-destructive assholes.  Eric's gonna die.  You're gonna get fired.  Fuck.  No, man.  We did our research.  We read the label.  Nah, he's fine.  Look at him.  We read the label.  They would have, like, one of those poison-like things on the fucking product.  They should put that on every bit of food in his fridge. 
[00:14:00]  Come on.  You don't have to sell me on.  There you go.  Huh?  You don't have to sell me on.  Dude.  All right, Footer.  Thank you, buddy.  Yes, that's accurate.  Of course it's accurate.  He's supposedly a human being.  Well, most people would find a human smaller than a whale.  Exactly.  Tor Johnson.  He put a little liquid shit on his tongue and vomited.  Tor Johnson. 
[00:14:30]  God damn.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sam, in just a little bit, we're going to be reviewing the website, Am I Gay?  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not.  Wrong producer.  Okay, who is the producer?  That would be Steve.  Okay.  I don't change.  That's awful.  Yes.  Yes, the website, Am I Gay?  Where people come and ask questions and we get to judge them.  Bob Kelly's in studio.  Opie and Anthony forcing himself on young Sam.  It's horrendous.  Stay tuned.  It's for Am I Gay on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:15:00]  Yes.  Oh, that would be a Steve C impression.  That's not right.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Danny found something very fun for the show today.  It's called Are You Gay?  And I guess it's a website.  Yeah, it's a website called Am I Gay?  And I guess you can go there and you can submit your questions if you're curious or if you have weird, strange feelings that you're not comfortable with.  You could go to this website and anonymously ask the question, Are You Gay? 
[00:15:30]  But this is kind of our bit.  We do Gay or Funny.  Yes, it is.  And I thought we could probably tackle this and take a few Gay or Funny calls at the same time.  Because as guys, you do end up getting into these kind of gay scenarios, but you're doing it for the laugh and not for the gay.  So we do a bit called Gay or Funny and you call up.  And what was one of the ones?  Oh, one of the ones was, this is a perfect example of Gay or Funny.  A guy calls up and he goes, All right, we're all at my friend's pool. 
[00:16:00]  And, of course, he has to go, There were women there.  And one guy, they convinced this guy, I don't think you can hold your breath underwater for the whole lap of the pool.  The guy goes, Fuck you, I can do that.  And he jumps in.  And as he's underwater trying to get to the other side, his buddy, like, drops his bathing suit and has his ball bag and his penis right there waiting for the guy when, you know, when you do try.  And he comes up for air.  And, you know, when we all try to do that, you know, that first breath is like. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  And there was waiting for him, you know, the guy's penis and ballies.  And we determined that was just funny.  That's funny.  That's just funny, not gay.  What happened after it was gay?  We just had to suck in him.  Yeah, yeah.  And the guy slowly fell to his knees and let him do it.  Yeah.  Shut a load of the pool.  So I guess this website kind of does what we've been doing for a while, but that's okay.  So what do you want us to do, Danny?  You want us to read the questions?  Yeah, I thought maybe you guys would have your own opinions on some of these questions. 
[00:17:00]  Well, Bobby is an expert on this stuff.  Maybe you would disagree with, perhaps, the owner of this website and his responses.  Maybe you would have some other responses.  Okay.  And these are the best ones you picked?  Yeah, these are some funny ones.  I mean, there's more, obviously, but these are some good ones.  But whoever reads this is going to sound gay.  Those clips are never leaving.  Those clips will be with you and follow you forever.  We could have David.  You want David to read them?  He would take so long.  That's true. 
[00:17:30]  I've always been.  You know what?  If you're really, really bothered by it, you could always play that music bed, and that  way we can't cut it off in production.  We got what?  Am I gay thinking music?  Yeah.  Great.  All right.  Here's the am I gay thinking music.  How about we take turns?  I'll do the first one.  Questions from men.  I've always been into women, and I love the female body.  Let me change my voice as someone else later on.  And sensitivity that women present. 
[00:18:00]  However, every time I get a serious girlfriend, which has been about three or four times, such  as the one I have now, I dream of her getting fucked by another guy while she's giving me  a head.  Jeez.  Or I dream of her sucking another guy's dick while I am doing her from behind.  I make her tell me that she wishes she was getting fucked by one or two other guys while she is  sucking my cock, and it turns me on like nothing else. 
[00:18:30]  I dream of her swallowing another guy's cum and slopping it onto my dick while she returns  to finish me off.  I like it.  She likes it.  And we both get extremely turned on by these fantasies that we act out in fantasy land,  although it has never happened in reality.  I could never kiss a guy.  That disgusts me.  The other part doesn't.  But surprisingly, I could suck a guy's cock and sometimes dream of it. 
[00:19:00]  I've even sucked on my girlfriend's dildo when she was unaware and I became extremely  turned on.  I have no desire to screw a guy in the ass.  That'd be gay.  But I sometimes think of sitting on a hard cock.  I've never acted out any of this, and I wonder if it should just remain in fantasy land.  Am I by Ted?  It's Ted and Jimmy's not here today?  I just realized that I was a fucker.  Oh, damn it.  I like sucking on hard cocks.  Ted from California. 
[00:19:30]  I'm a cuckold.  Ted the cuckold.  I wish you'd slop your cum on my cock.  I like it.  She likes it.  We all like it.  Bobby?  Is this guy gay?  That's some gay stuff, no?  Did you get that off my computer?  I have a tough time, and the phones will be lit once again, but there's a lot of guys  out there that could have another naked guy in the room.  I've had it many times.  And I just can't do that. 
[00:20:00]  I've had it many times.  And then a lot of guys are like, what's the big deal?  And we lose the argument all the time.  More guys will tell us, look, there's nothing gay about it at all.  I had Sherrod Smalls fucking blasting a flight attendant with his fucking 17-inch cock while  I was trying to get ahead.  Oh, God.  Okay?  He was attached to her like a fucking alien.  What the fuck?  Latched on, and I had to hold his sweaty head.  I had to hold it back because his head kept touching where my cock was. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  I don't know.  That's good for you guys.  I can pull it off.  I don't know.  Dude, let me tell you something.  There's nothing fucking better than to be fucking a chick from behind and your friends  getting ahead.  And then there's that second of eye contact where you both go and you start giggling and  you got to hold it in and you're making it into a moan.  See, Bob, it's not a time to giggle.  Oh, it's hilarious.  You're high-fiving while you're fucking blasting a chick. 
[00:21:00]  Look, I can't even argue it anymore.  We lost that argument with the listeners a long time ago.  A lot of dudes go, look, there's nothing wrong with it.  No, nothing wrong with it.  All right.  Here's the answer according to the website.  What do you think this guy is, Bobby?  What this guy is?  Well, he said he wants to suck on a dildo.  He has.  He has sucked on a dildo.  Well, when you stop putting fucking cocks in your mouth alone on a couch while you're  watching reruns of fucking, uh...  Go ahead.  I'm off of the show. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  Here's what the website says.  It's a muscle.  Here's the answer.  Ted, wanting to watch another guy doing a girlfriend or having her suck his dick is  not gay.  No.  Another guy's cum on your cock?  That's kind of gay.  That's kind of gay, sir.  Sucking and sitting on a cock?  Definitely gay.  Or in your case, bi.  You definitely have the potential to be bi.  Whether you leave it as a fantasy is up to you, my friend, and your girlfriend. 
[00:22:00]  If she's not involved in the scenario.  Or it says if she's involved in the scenario.  Oh, if she's involved in the scenario.  There you go.  If this guy wants to suck a cock...  Yeah, you're gay.  He's gay.  Oh, bi.  No, no, no, no.  Wait, let me just defend this.  Bobby's fighting for bi.  Look at bi.  Because he does fuck chicks.  For his own happiness.  Look at me, Anthony.  You. 
[00:22:30]  You, you.  Look at me.  Yeah.  Look at me.  Look at my eyes with those big brown beautiful eyes you have.  I cannot fathom anyone wanting to suck a dick and not just be like, yeah, I'm gay.  So you can't go back to pussy after you suck a dick.  You wouldn't want to.  Why not?  Because cock's so wonderful.  Because you just sucked a dick.  If you made that jump, it's like jumping off a cliff.  There's no going back.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  Once I hit bottom, I'll fucking, I'll go back.  Bottom.  You're a bottom or top.  Sloppy party party.  Bobby, John from Kansas City.  Is this true?  Bobby just wishes the woman wasn't in the room.  Yeah.  All right, Ant, it's your turn.  Use a radio voice and then they can't cut this up and make it sound like this is you.  Right.  Here's the Am I Gay thinking music.  All right.  After foreplay, when we're about to have sex, there's a 50-50 chance that my boyfriend is going to put his penis between my butt cheeks and hump until he comes. 
[00:23:30]  I guess this is, this is the girl's side?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  After foreplay.  Can't do it, girl, boys.  Just remember, this is a girl.  It's just intense rubbing, no anal penetration.  Even though I don't feel like I'm getting any pleasure from it, my vagina gets wet. 
[00:24:00]  I mean, she's getting some kind of pleasure?  No?  Pleasure.  Pleasure.  And if he touches me down there and feels that I'm wet, it seems to turn him on even more.  What's going on here?  He's affectionate in public and private with me.  Gets aroused easily by my body, especially if I'm wearing a low-top, short skirt or bathing suit.  And he was very straight.  Oh, and he was very upset that we dated almost six months before I finally agreed to have sex with him. 
[00:24:30]  All signs seem to point to straight, but the whole anal thing confuses me.  If he's not gay or bisexual, why is it that it takes him 20-plus minutes to cum during vaginal sex, but only five to seven minutes to cum during anal?  Because it's easy to pit you as a little boy when you're on your stomach.  Can I answer this question, or do you want it, man?  Opie, field it.  Field this fucking fly ball into center field. 
[00:25:00]  Because your asshole is much tighter, you loose cunt.  Do you know how a guy's anatomy works at all?  Well, because, too, when you're in the vagina...  You loose, sloppy whore?  Those tits ruin his fantasy.  It can't be a fucking young twink if it has nice tits.  There can't be a woman that thinks that if a guy wants some ass sex that he's gay.  Right.  Unless it's off her brother or something. 
[00:25:30]  Well, Anthony, why don't you answer as maybe as...  Because a lot of people say, and this sounds a lot like maybe...  C.C.  Case, I'm reading...  Oh, you can't do voices today.  No, I wish I could, man.  Maybe next time when we do this.  Voice of shit.  All right, what's the answer?  This guy, are we in agreement, is not gay?  Not gay.  Not gay yet?  Uh, not gay.  This is so not gay.  All right.  This is the not-not-as-gay thing ever.  I've actually done this rubbing your cock in the butt cheeks. 
[00:26:00]  September 11th, I was on the set.  Jesus.  Are you talking 2001?  Yeah, when everything went down.  I was stuck in Jersey on the set of a TV show.  Uh-huh.  And they put us up in these hotels, and I actually wound up sharing a hotel with an extra hot chick.  Uh-huh.  And she wouldn't let me...  I wish it was the fucking Marriott.  Go local for everybody.  No, I'm joking.  I didn't do anything.  All right.  No?  No.  Let's get the answer out there.  What is everyone saying on Pal Talk? 
[00:26:30]  Not gay or gay yet?  Uh, not gay.  This has to be not gay.  It's so not gay.  Let me get the Am I Gay music back on.  Uh, Jamie, what you're describing isn't anal sex.  It's a form of frottage or sexual stimulation by rubbing, in this case, against your butt cheeks.  Some guys like to rub their dick between a woman's breasts, thighs, or feet.  And even a woman's armpit. 
[00:27:00]  Axolism.  Yeah.  It's called axolism.  Is it?  One of my...  Yeah.  Not one of my fetishes, but one of my favorite fetishes to talk about, because it's so fucking weird.  Hmm.  It was in my fetish book.  I like that.  I like eating an armpit like a pussy.  I don't know why your boyfriend gets off so much at this.  Maybe he likes the feeling better than vaginal intercourse.  Or maybe your ass just really turns him on.  However, it doesn't mean he's gay.  Even if he liked to penetrate you anally, that would not make him gay.  A lot of straight men, and even some straight women, enjoy anal sex. 
[00:27:30]  There you go.  Yeah.  There's nothing about rubbing your cock on any part of a woman.  Of course not.  That makes you gay.  Of course not.  All right.  Where's...  Get Sam in here to read one.  But Bobby, why don't we go to you for the next one?  Wait.  This one?  Yeah.  Fuck.  We're just going around the room, I swear to God.  I swear to God.  You fucking picked a quick winner for me, didn't you? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, what do you got?  A bad one.  Oh, Jesus.  This is a bad one.  I once checked out some gay porn.  And now when I masturbate, I come way harder when I think of gay porn.  Wow.  Yet I have no physical attraction to desire to be with a man.  I am happily married and very much enjoy the sex with my wife.  Am I gay?  Jim Norton from Manhattan.  Wow, I would say you're gay. 
[00:28:30]  I would say if you're jerking off...  To gay porn.  To gay porn.  That's gay.  I would call that gay.  The gay is before the word porn.  All right, what if...  It's pretty much gay porn.  Right.  What if, like, the guy in the gay porn looked like Sam?  That's not gay, because Sam is very girl-like.  Yeah, that'd be not cute.  Very twinkish.  I mean, although the hair is...  Once they grow hair, it's over.  No, we braided the hair. 
[00:29:00]  I have some masculine qualities.  Yeah, name one.  Strong jawbone?  No.  Yeah, if you want to put cum on it, so...  All right, what's the answer, Bobby?  No, you're not gay.  Get the fuck...  This website sucks.  Wait a minute.  You might be bi...  Okay.  ...if you gave it a chance.  But, if you're not really interested or curious, and you're not satisfied with your sex life with your spouse... 
[00:29:30]  And you're satisfied with your sex life with your spouse.  There's no real reason to experiment and find out.  Of course, if you keep jacking off to the thoughts of gay sex, you probably are going to get a little curious about what it's like at that point.  So, you may or may not like...  It's a stepping bone.  ...like it in real life.  So, don't do anything that's going to jeopardize your marriage, sucker, fat cock.  If you and your wife have the sort of relationship where you talk about these things, tell her about your fantasies. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, that's going to go over good.  Hey, listen.  I was thinking about fucking taking it in the ass and sucking and swallowing load.  What do you think about that, honey?  And maybe you can watch gay porn together.  Get the fuck out of here.  If I ever told my wife, hey, baby.  I want to watch Sam fucking Travis.  I have a video of that.  That's what I'm thinking, too.  How do you get that done?  Yeah.  What do you...  No! 
[00:30:30]  Your wife's going to be fucking you with one eye open?  Like, ugh.  Am I gay?  I watched meat spin until I felt like I was seasick.  Until I...  Until my eyes were spinning in my head.  Until I came and it shot into my own mouth.  By accident.  Alright, let's go to Sam.  And by I, I mean the guy that I was with.  You can't watch fucking porn.  How do you even...  Could you imagine going to Lindsay?  Lindsay, can I talk to you?  Hell fucking no.  Yeah, sure.  What's up?  That's nuts.  She would laugh at me. 
[00:31:00]  Little gay porno.  Alright, let's go to Sam.  Sam gets the next one.  Here's your gay music.  I got it right here, Sam.  Here you go, baby doll.  If you're jacking...  The last one on the page.  The gay porn.  The real short one.  If you're watching...  If you're jacking a gay porn.  You can watch gay porn...  As a goof?  As a goof.  For like three seconds.  Yeah, we were all in the office that one day.  Watching gay porn.  Laughing our asses off.  Because nothing funnier than seeing a guy's dick in another guy's ass.  There's...  Let me tell you something.  The difference between gay porn and fucking straight porn... 
[00:31:30]  Gay guys are...  They're like literally cumming machines.  They just...  He's sucking the cock the exact way you need to suck it to make it cum.  There's no cute licks and little cute eye things.  He's like, do you like that, baby?  Girls make it sexy and hot and desirable.  Guys just open their mouth, close their lips around their teeth the perfect way, and they  just fuck a face.  Is that the perfect way, Bobby?  Yeah.  That's what I learned. 
[00:32:00]  No worries.  All right.  Let's go to Sam.  I like sticking large objects in my rectum, but have never had a boyfriend.  I find men attractive, but have never dated one.  I don't have a girlfriend either.  Am I gay?  Yeah, you faggot.  The response is...  Wait, come over here and read the response on my lap. 
[00:32:30]  I don't want to.  What?  Yeah, you might as well, Sam.  Get over here.  You're kind of uncomfortable under the table.  Get over here.  It's for the show.  You know that.  It sucks.  It's not for the show.  It's for us.  Get over here.  Right on this little knee right here, Sam Bones.  Put that little bony ass right...  Ugh.  I wanted to feel the bone.  Get in the middle.  Ah!  The response is...  As you sit on Bobby's lap. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bob's rocking me.  The response is...  Yes, you're gay.  Find yourself a boyfriend to help you insert those large objects.  You'll have more fun.  Like a little jar.  Sam's asshole got fucking nervous.  Was it puckering?  I felt it getting nervous.  He had a shy eye.  I like girls.  What?  Yeah, do you?  All right.  Should we move on to the next one? 
[00:33:30]  Jesus Christ.  What other ones?  These are fucked, man.  Come on.  I'm just saying all gay.  Danny, we don't have time to do all these.  Which ones are really good?  Yeah, I'm trying to...  Let me...  Here, take a quick look.  One, maybe two more of these.  You want to do a few short ones?  I'd like to read a personal one.  I don't care.  If the long one is funny, I don't care.  Just give me the best of the best.  Can I read a personal one from my own diary later in the show?  Sure.  And you can answer and tell me if it's gay or not? 
[00:34:00]  Of course.  Thanks.  This could lead to a round of gay or funny, by the way, for the people out there.  This guy sounds like a treat.  They're all good.  I know.  They're all fucking funny.  Should I just do the next one?  Sure.  All right.  I'm a 35-year-old male and having no trouble meeting women and having sex with them, which  I enjoy very much.  I have fantasies about other men giving me anal sex.  I don't ever think I could go through with having sex with another man, though, because 
[00:34:30]  men actually turn me off.  I just like anal sex to the point that I use a dildo on myself.  What does this mean?  Jim in Texas.  That's got to be gay.  I'd say gay.  The dildo looks like a peony.  Like a dick.  Maybe if it looks like something else, maybe not.  I don't know.  What if the dildo doesn't have veins and a helmet? 
[00:35:00]  It's just smooth and glassy.  Like you're sitting on a shower nozzle.  Gay.  It's too close to looking like a penis.  I mean, if you were able to put a block in your ass, then maybe not gay, because it doesn't  look like the male thing.  A block?  Like a square dildo?  If you get a square dildo.  That's what I'm always saying.  You're not gay.  That's what I'm always...  How about a hammer handle?  If you could put Lego pieces in your asshole, you're not gay. 
[00:35:30]  There you go.  Or little trophies and stuff.  That's what I don't understand about lesbians.  They hate the dick, but their strap-ons and their belts and stuff, they're using the dick.  Yeah, and not just the dick.  You would think the lesbian community at this point would have figured out some new, like,  shape.  Yeah.  That makes it go, look, see, we want to fill up our vaginas with fullness, but we don't  want it to look like a penis.  It's a dick that's shaped like a vagina, and it's a changed purse. 
[00:36:00]  You know what I mean?  If you don't like dick and you're a lesbian, why are you using something that looks just  like a dick?  I never understood that.  I understand there's not many options out there, but there's got to be something you  could do to that to totally take away from the fact that it looks like a penis.  Thank you.  Maybe they, like, buy a blow-up doll and scissor with it.  Scissor.  Scissoring is the stupidest thing ever.  Scissoring just looks silly.  Fucking fucks me.  Scissoring your fucking mushing.  Suction together.  Just mushing your vaginas together. 
[00:36:30]  Two fucking plungers going at it.  I was having a conversation yesterday about scissoring and how ridiculous it is, and then  I started wondering if I could find a picture of guys scissoring.  Oh my god.  What?  Did you?  So I really hope no one ever looks for anything on my computer.  You found it?  Well, no.  It's just that if you type in, like, the letter G, it's going to come up like guys, gay  guys scissoring.  Well, what's your email address in case somebody finds one?  Fucking mushing hot balls together. 
[00:37:00]  Hot balls.  Let's say hi to Kirsten from San Diego.  Kirsten.  Hey.  Hey, Kirsten.  How are you?  Good.  I just wanted to comment, because a lot of guys really like anal stimulation.  It doesn't have to be gay, whether the dildo looks like a penis or not.  Can I ask you?  We've lost this argument over the years, too.  We were like, that's fucked up, and the guys will call until Ron and Fez and say, man, 
[00:37:30]  there's nothing gay about it.  I like a little something, something going on there.  Can I ask her something?  I know what's going on with my butthole.  Can I ask her?  What's her name?  Kristen.  Kristen, can I ask you a question?  And now it's destroying the furniture in this place.  Right, right, exactly.  I mean, fuck.  I've had a few opportunities where, and I'm like, because I know what is going on there.  I'm like, I'm not going to put you through that. 
[00:38:00]  I've had opportunities where mine was so bad.  Norton was in the other room.  He'll tell you the story.  All he heard was, and then the way that you hear this, her trying to get whatever was in  her mouth out, and she almost puked.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah, it was great.  But let me ask you a question, Kristen.  Do you think it's gay if while you're eating my asshole, I look down at you and go, yeah,  eat my pussy, bitch.  If I refer to my asshole as my pussy. 
[00:38:30]  As your man pussy.  That's a little weird.  What if you say man pussy?  Yeah, my man pussy.  My fat lips.  And then you call her like Mike.  I think eating ass is totally something.  I mean, it feels good.  That is a stimulating sexual spot for anybody.  What if I need you to shape your tongue like a fucking cock and mush it out of my ass?  While sticking your other thumb in my mouth while I suck it. 
[00:39:00]  Jesus, Bobby.  You're so gay, Bobby.  Jesus.  I still don't think it's gay.  I think it's just a sexually stimulating spot.  I mean, think about anal beads.  That is a pleasure thing for men, mostly.  Because that prostate is just so sensitive, and it feels so good.  Okay, so what if you, instead of anal beads, you use like rope from a ship?  With those discs that keep the rats from crawling up?  Would that be bad?  And the rats. 
[00:39:30]  Ow.  Okay, what if you came in the room, right?  And I had your high heels on, and I was holding the high heels and spreading my asshole apart.  And I drew with a sharpie, like, vagina lips around my asshole.  Would that be gay?  For you or for me?  For you.  For me.  Oh.  For both of us.  Oh, by the way, Sam, you're officially gay, because you did the dildo in the mouth thing. 
[00:40:00]  Sorry, buddy.  That is true.  No, you didn't.  You sucked that thing.  Oh, my God.  No, you didn't see the pictures?  No.  Sorry about that.  Oh, fuck.  Pop those pics up, because you're going to shoot a load in your pants when you see the  way this kid sucks a cock.  Where was the question about swallowing dildos?  I want to help Sam out.  You might skate on this.  What the fuck?  I was told to.  By who?  Opie.  Really?  If he told you to jump off a bridge, would you suck a dick and then do it? 
[00:40:30]  I was wondering where you're going with that.  Can I just say something?  Listen to me, dude.  I'm not even fucking joking around.  I love watching girls give head.  I love.  And I love, because I can tell if a girl gives good head by the way her fucking mouth is.  Wow.  And the fact that his mouth is, his lips, his upper lip is curved in a little bit.  What?  To protect this fake dick from teeth scraping.  Those treacherous teeth.  And his eyes are shut.  And his cheeks are sucked in. 
[00:41:00]  Would you ever close your eyes if you were sucking a cock, Anthony?  No, I'd want to look right into either the eyes of the man or his pubic mouth.  The fuck do you think?  Who would you look at?  I'd be shutting my fucking eyes.  But would you shut them softly like this faggot?  They're not shut softly.  Whatever the prisoner is telling me to do so he doesn't put a shank in my neck.  Because that's the only way I'm sucking a cock.  If you were sucking a cock.  And I'm going to be beat up.  Whatever makes him happier there, Bobby.  If you were sucking a cock, you'd squint your eyes. 
[00:41:30]  They'd just be wrinkled up.  This faggot looks like a dead fairy.  Look, he was doing it for the radio show.  Will you leave him alone?  Leave me alone.  They're just softly shut.  That's telling him in a masculine way.  I got the answer.  Leave me alone.  I got the answer to that question I read a while ago at this point.  Oh, this is the one where the guy uses the dildo on himself.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Jim.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It means...  Go ahead, Bobby.  I just...  There's more photos. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  But they get worse as they go along.  Why is Travis taking a ton of pictures?  Because one...  How about better?  All right, guys.  This is fucking...  The fact that you're just sucking on the helmet makes me want to puke.  Because it's not you.  All right.  Here's the question to the guy with the dildos and his own ass.  Yeah.  Jim, it means...  Whoa, I got...  We got to put the music on.  Yeah, I got to put the music on.  That's a fucking career saver.  Jim, it means you like getting fucked in the ass, but that in itself doesn't say a whole 
[00:42:30]  lot.  Plenty of men who are not gay enjoy taking it up the butt.  Some use dildos on themselves, and some have their lady friends peg them with strap-ons.  A lot of them never have sex with men, so if you can find a woman willing to strap it  on and go to town on your ass, you can have all the anal sex you want without having to  get near another guy.  The fact that you fantasize about sex with men indicates you probably have some bisexual 
[00:43:00]  tendencies.  But if you're not really attracted to guys, maybe those tendencies aren't very strong.  On the other hand, maybe you just haven't met the right guy.  On to the next question.  Oh yeah, this is a party dude.  Wow, this guy sounds like everyone you want at a tailgate party.  And I know this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I know this guy.  I think everybody knows this guy.  Everyone knows one of these guys?  Yeah.  All right, if everyone knows this guy, we could answer a question today, because I'm sure 
[00:43:30]  a lot of people are wondering if that guy they know is gay or not.  You know who I think should read this, though?  Huh?  Tank Hankerous.  He's sick.  Tank Hankerous went home sick.  He threw up in the parking lot.  Too much jizzing in his belly.  He actually threw up.  E-Rock threw up.  Yeah, he texted me and he said...  He's finally full?  He said...  No, he was just making room for lunch.  Take that, fatso.  I know you're still listening to us.  You obsessed fan that works for this show. 
[00:44:00]  Fuck, is this Lord of the Rings?  Holy shit.  Stupid E-Rock.  Yeah, stupid E-Rock.  All right, go ahead.  I have a question.  I like to go out and party.  When I do, sometimes I end up dropping my pants.  Doesn't matter if it's a football tailgate party, a bar, or a house party.  I just enjoy showing my package. 
[00:44:30]  What I can understand is that I get really excited when my guy friends look at my groin area.  Get the fuck out of here.  You know, it isn't like they stare, but even the slightest glance by a dude makes  the hairs on my neck stand up.  Am I just an exhibitionist, or am I gay?  P.S.  I also have a cat.  It has to be gay. 
[00:45:00]  I would say if you're getting off in any way, shape, or form at showing your dick to your  friends, your guy friends.  You could do it for the shock value and the goof, but if you're getting excited because  they're glancing down a little bit.  What if you have low self-esteem and that's the only attention and positivity you get?  Like, you take your cock out and if you look at it and go, wow, and I see you looking at  it like, ah, you respect it.  No, it's you, though. 
[00:45:30]  If you're getting turned on sexually by guys looking at your dick, you're gay.  If you're whipping your dick out and just going, look at my fucking dick, you sorry son of a  bitch, then that's not gay.  That's just boasting.  So if I took my dick out and I saw you looking at it, and then that turned me on, that's gay.  You're so fucking gay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're next to each other at the urinal.  You peek over and get a little, a little harder.  You're squirting that piss a little further into my own face. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  I'm drinking it.  It's hitting your chin.  It's like the fucking Caesar's palace fountains.  Evil Knievel tried to jump it.  So, uh, by the way, Bobby, did you say Lord of the Rings instead of Lord of the Flies?  No, I was talking about you.  I did say that, but it had nothing to do with that.  That new intern, that new intern that walked in looked like a fucking hobbit.  Oh, okay.  Have you seen him?  I don't know which one, so.  Go ahead, Ann. 
[00:46:30]  What's the answer?  The answer is, uh, dear Anonymous, because he was anonymous in Oklahoma, you're a gay  exhibitionist.  Well, maybe not gay, but you're definitely an exhibitionist.  Uh, are you gay because you like attention from other men?  It's very possible.  Most straight male exhibitionists get off on exposing themselves to women.  There may be other reasons that it excites you to have another guy check out your goods.  Maybe it's just an ego thing, but it seems pretty sexual, so you're probably gay or bi, especially 
[00:47:00]  since you have a cat.  Or a small dog named Dexter.  What?  Oh, boy.  All right, let me, real quick, uh, read the next one.  It's fast.  A lot of times after the show, I like to watch gay porn all the time.  P.S.  I came in my own face a few weeks ago.  Am I gay?  Derek B.  In New York City.  Derek.  Wow, Derek.  Jeez. 
[00:47:30]  Derek B.  Why would you cum in your face?  I don't know.  Because you're probably gay.  You're probably gay.  Probably like the taste or something.  You want to cum in your face.  Yeah, and then why would you tell all your co-workers about it the next day?  Yeah, you must be gay.  Yeah.  Wow, you know a lot about this letter.  Almost like you couldn't wait to tell all your friends.  You got some of your own cum in your face.  Just in case you want to move on to the next step, someone else's cum in your face?  Hey, you know, I had no problem with cum in my face. 
[00:48:00]  He's just throwing that fishing line in the water.  Yeah, that's what it was.  But just one of us goes, really, tell me more.  He was chumming with his own cum.  I think we're going to need a bigger cock.  It wasn't even, like, speaking of which.  It was a complete, like, non-sequitur.  It's like, hey, you think this bed would be good for something?  And he's just like, oh, I came in my own face the other day.  Dude, I just...  Yes, Travis?  I walked in when we came from CBS that day, and the first time I see Derek, he's like, 
[00:48:30]  came in my face last night.  Derek's fucking insane, by the way.  He certainly is.  He comes off like a regular guy, but you spend ten minutes with him and you realize he's fucking insane.  And gay, and completely gay.  I got an inch of my, like, maybe a little less than an inch of my cock in my own mouth once.  What?  No way.  Absolutely.  How'd you do that?  I fucking bounced on the back of my neck in the tub.  You had to flip my legs over my head. 
[00:49:00]  And just the top of my cock got in my mouth.  I'm sure it was yours.  It's like, I think I'm doing this.  Some guy's going, yeah, keep sucking.  You're doing a great job sucking your own cock.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  We were going to end this, but there's two ways.  This one's ridiculous.  Earlier this year...  Anthony, you can...  They're all so ridiculous.  Listen to this one.  Anthony can suck his own cock right now. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, I wish.  Don't even bend over.  Earlier this year...  Back hurts.  Let me get this on the air, because this one is just a treat for everybody.  Earlier this year, I went on a fishing trip with the guys and my father-in-law.  No music?  It doesn't even matter at this point.  Fuck it.  You went on a fishing trip.  We could play that back.  One night, we all got kind of drunk.  Uh-oh.  My father-in-law suggested strip poker.  All right.  Before we knew it, we were all nude.  Nice.  We went to bed, and later, my father-in-law crawled in the bed with me. 
[00:50:00]  Nice.  Get the fuck out of here.  Nice.  I pretended I was passed out, and he started giving me a hand.  Nice.  Was his name Richard?  Was it in a tree fort?  He pretended to be asleep.  After that, he slowly massaged my anus.  Nice.  Again, I pretended I was passed out, but I really, really enjoyed this.  Am I gay?  Gordon from Minnesota.  Wow.  Not only gay, that is, like, fucking disturbing who you're doing it with gay. 
[00:50:30]  Gordon, if your wife's father's calling into bed naked with you, giving you a handjob,  and fingering your ass, you've got bigger problems to worry about than whether or not you're gay.  I can imagine what your family dinners with the in-laws are like.  This situation cannot possibly end well.  It's like when fucking Kramer burnt down the locked cabin with the cigars.  Oh, my God.  These letters.  These letters, he's more of a man.  We went into emergency alert system.  Yeah, I just heard that myself.  What?  What? 
[00:51:00]  What did they miss?  What happened?  Are we back?  Are we back?  I don't perform for three people.  I performed for a million, so let me know when we're back.  I don't even acknowledge these people.  Are we back?  Are we back?  We're back.  What did they miss?  Better than ever.  We're back.  Take it off the air.  This is a test of the emergency alert system.  What did we miss there, people?  Help me out.  This is only a test.  And what did we miss?  Did they know on Peltalk?  Because that was a good one.  Where did we leave off?  I don't know. 
[00:51:30]  But they get to here.  Oh.  Oh.  Ixnay.  Last we heard was what?  No music.  The whole thing they lost?  Yeah.  I ain't fucking reading that again.  I will.  I will.  I will.  All right, Bobby.  I want to read it from the bathroom.  All right, Bobby.  Why don't you read the one?  Because this was...  They didn't get any of this?  I'm not sure.  I'm still working on it.  This is a hot one.  This is a sexy one.  Where is it?  Where is it, Sam?  Help me out.  Where do we leave off? 
[00:52:00]  It's Gordon there.  All right, here we go.  I got it.  Just read it fast again.  Early this year, I went on a fishing trip with the guys and my father-in-law.  One night, we all got kind of drunk.  My father-in-law suggested we strip polka.  Before we knew, we were all nude.  Went to bed that night, and later, my father-in-law crawled into bed with me, and I pretended I was passed out.  He started to give me a handjob.  After that, he slowly massaged my anus.  Again, I pretended I was passed out.  I really, really enjoyed this. 
[00:52:30]  Am I gay, Gordon, from Minnesota?  Wow, they missed the whole story, I just found out.  But now we got it on because of Bobby.  All right, Bobby, what was the answer?  The answer is, if your wife's father's crawling into bed naked with you, giving you a handjob and figuring your asshole,  you've got bigger problems to worry about than whether you're gay or not.  I can imagine what your family dinners with the in-laws are like.  This situation cannot possibly end well. 
[00:53:00]  I'd love to go camping.  Can you read this really short one from Brad in NYU?  Brad.  Could you reach into the register?  Brad, give me my money back.  Last night, I gave my friend a handjob for not even five minutes.  Am I gay?  Brad, NYU. 
[00:53:30]  Last night, I gave my friend a handjob for not even five minutes.  It's a goof.  It's a goof.  That's gay, right?  It has to be.  It has to be.  It has to be.  The joke's on him, right?  The joke's on him.  It's not gay.  Look, here, listen to my little analogy.  You walk into a bank to rob it.  Right.  You pull a gun out.  It takes five minutes to get all the money.  Right.  You just robbed the fucking bank.  You're a bank robber.  What if you don't take the money?  You walk in.  It takes 20 minutes.  What if the guy. 
[00:54:00]  You're a fucking bank robber?  What if the guy didn't make a deposit?  What if you don't take the money?  You took the money.  What if you say.  You robbed the bank.  Or withdraw.  Check it out.  You go, stick him up.  Yeah.  And then you go, ah, I'm just kidding.  I'm kidding.  And you put the gun away and lose.  Then you're an attempted faggot.  You're committing attempted faggotry.  He's not gay.  He's an attempted faggot.  What does this website say yet?  Well, it says, relax.  Touching a dick for five minutes will not turn you gay.  One hand job will not turn you gay. 
[00:54:30]  Do you still like girls?  Then you're not gay.  You still like girls, but you enjoy touching a dick and would do it again?  Then maybe you're bi.  You never really like girls, and you're secretly hoping your friend asks for a blowjob next time?  Okay, you're probably gay.  So he kind of left the balls in his court and the dick in his mouth.  What if it's just your consistency freak?  The next one, it's short, and it's kind of good. 
[00:55:00]  All right.  Bobby, read, or ask, who wants to read the last one?  Sam does a good job.  Yeah, Sam, read it.  All right, Sam, go ahead.  You got it?  They're all so good.  Which one do you get on the last one?  The one that starts, my boyfriend claims he's straight.  Oh, it's from Jess.  My boyfriend claims he's straight, but I found emails to other men on his computer.  He blames it on the fact that he's stressed out, and it was a fantasy, and the act itself of being with another man made him sick. 
[00:55:30]  Is he gay or bi?  Anonymous in Arizona.  Anonymous in Arizona.  It was a fantasy.  Oh, the act of it.  Yeah, you know, I've been stressed out.  The first thing I do, I start just dropping emails to guys.  Yeah, hit the porn zone.  I've done it too, dude.  Jesus, Bobby.  Especially during April, when tax seasons, I'm just fucking typing away.  I'm so stressed.  You know what's fucked up about Bobby?  You're trying to defend every single question in this bit.  Yeah, I just want to defend these guys. 
[00:56:00]  It's not gay.  Yeah, I've never been with a woman.  I just like tics in my ass.  Am I gay?  I think Bobby's trying to hold out.  Someone farted again.  Not me.  I think Bobby's trying to hold out to the fact that he might just be bi.  But learning today that he's losing that.  I just remember that when a girl was knuckling my asshole, how good that felt.  Yeah, but according to what we read and according to past phone calls, that's not gay.  Not gay.  Not gay.  Not gay.  When you're begging her to fuck your pussy. 
[00:56:30]  See, that's when you're saying fuck my pussy.  No, Bobby.  That doesn't mean no.  That's fucking gay.  That wouldn't mean no, because for me to be gay, I would have to be a guy wanting to-  You are?  You're a lesbian.  I'm calling it a-  It's not a pussy.  It's your fucking man, asshole.  I would be more of a lesbian than I would a fag.  I think you're a lesbian.  Because I'm calling it a pussy.  Nah.  Maybe back when you had breasts.  Can you imagine that? 
[00:57:00]  It's a past fat joke.  Yeah, we like the past fat jokes.  You just said that with the guy at Fast Times at Ridgemont.  It's a past fat joke.  It's a past fat joke.  Listen to me.  You never had your asshole eaten?  You're right.  You're fucking gay?  Yeah.  No, I've never-  Look at me.  Look at me and say it.  I've never had my asshole eaten.  You're smiling.  I don't.  Because you're looking at me like you want to fucking say you want it eaten.  Hey, Obie, have you ever had your asshole eaten? 
[00:57:30]  You're lying.  This motherfucker.  God damn.  I've never seen fucking somebody break down that quick.  This motherfucker broke down.  Like, did you see how fast he fucking-  This cock, sorry.  I'm never going to do a crime with Obie.  Because he'll crack in two seconds.  Did you guys rob that?  Yeah, no.  No.  Yes, we did.  We did.  I've had my asshole eaten, too.  Do we have another live read?  Yeah.  Hey, Danny.  Danny, have you ever had your asshole?  Yes. 
[00:58:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Recently?  Nah.  Recently.  Now?  In the past two days, three-  Have you ever had it eaten when it's just dirty?  And hot and wet?  When isn't it?  When is a man's ass not dirty?  You know, you gotta scrub a dub-dub, that fucking thing.  And even then, it's like-  Dear, am I gay?  My asshole is perfectly clean.  Am I gay?  Yes, you are.  You're not a man.  I had two situations.  I had one where this girl went down to eat my ass.  She used to put me on all fours and a pillow under my stomach. 
[00:58:30]  Jesus.  Fucking Lamaze class?  And she went down to eat my ass.  It was a hot, hot summer day.  Hot.  Hot.  And she went to eat my ass, and she went down, took a couple swipes, and then went like that  and slapped my ass.  She went like this.  Go wash your ass, honey.  It stinks.  Of course.  I ran in and scrubbed my ass.  Trying to get the smell out of your ass is like trying to wash your hands after handling 
[00:59:00]  an onion.  You just-  No matter what you do.  You think it's okay for a few seconds.  Right.  But then it's back.  That onion will come back.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sam, in just a few moments, people are upset.  Well, the thing about the O.P. and Anthony Show is a lot of negative energy, believe it  or not.  A lot of negative vibes come across through the O.P. and Anthony Show, and we tend to  ruin things for people.  Just everyday stuff that nobody thinks twice about. 
[00:59:30]  Whether it's movies or a favorite dish or anything, the O.P. and Anthony Show ruins things,  and when we come back, we set blame for it and go over some of the things.  It's all so funny.  Stay tuned.  You know, Sam, we hear from a lot of the listeners that if you're a fan of this show,  you find that certain everyday things, they're just common to everybody, are ruined because  of our show.  People have complained and called in and whatever.  They've seen us on the streets that O.A. have ruined a lot of things for these people. 
[01:00:00]  And this is when O.A. take blame for it and they start going over with some of the fans.  What has the O.P. and Anthony Show ruined for you?  A lot of stuff.  I ruin things.  Holy shit, this is stupid.  This is the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Five minutes into it, you're like, what the fuck?  On the virus, Sirius XM.  Whackbag had a great thread on how we ruin things for people in regular life.  And maybe we could start a little phone topic, other things we've ruined, like Ant ruined 
[01:00:30]  that recital for that parent there.  Sorry about that.  But there's other stuff that we have ruined for our listeners just by, you know, having  our little radio show.  So we'll take a few of those calls.  All right, let's go with our bit.  Adam in Boston.  Adam.  Hey, guys, real quick.  Those guys chiming in about you guys just being the destroyer of worlds, you've really  ruined any Al Pacino movie.  I tried watching the Cerfico this weekend.  He goes to pick up his shoes from his brother and he's like, you did a good job.  All I can think about is my lifts. 
[01:01:00]  I got my lifts.  Yeah.  Even in the old movies, right?  When he was a good actor?  Yeah.  When he was really quiet, Al Pacino.  Yeah.  My shoes.  Yeah.  Put a ladder to get up to these.  I need nice big lifts.  Put a little motorized things and scoop me along.  I need stilts with laces.  You know that when the Oscars and the award shows start coming around, the Razzies come  out, the movies that they hate.  Pacino up for two for that 88 minutes.  And Righteous Kill.  Yeah.  And for the one Righteous Kill. 
[01:01:30]  Righteous Kill.  Righteous Kill.  Stunk and Righteous Kill.  And so did De Niro.  De Niro should be up for one too.  Both those movies were up for it.  And I think as like worst movies.  What a bag of shit that movie was.  Just.  Ugh.  Yeah.  It was fucking.  What were their names?  Hey, Turk.  Turk.  Rooster.  Rooster.  Rooster and Turk.  Gay lovers from the 30s.  That's right.  I hate when people's characters say each other's names.  Okay, Turk.  Ah, Rooster. 
[01:02:00]  Where are you, Turk?  I don't know who I am.  It's like I got a rooster on my head.  Should have been shrimp and fatso.  Let's go to phones.  Now they're lit with things we've ruined.  Gary in New York.  Gary.  What's up, boys?  Hi, Gary.  I was dating a black girl for two years before I started listening to your show.  Ruined interracial relationships, did we? 
[01:02:30]  All right.  Look how I say we.  All right.  Let's say hi to Newsday Laura.  Newsday Laura.  Hi, buddy.  Good evening.  You work for a newspaper.  How stupid are you?  Newspapers are going away.  Okay.  But Laura.  I wanted to say that Anthony has ruined my dog sitting on the couch or going on the bed.  See?  Why?  Because anytime, you know, we're on Pal Talk, I show him we got a new lab puppy.  He goes, oh, that's cute.  But dog rubs its asshole all over the fucking pillows.  Then you put your head on the pillows.  And you're fucking writing your dog shit. 
[01:03:00]  And now you're sniffing dog asshole.  That's why I don't like watching dogs up on people's couches.  Even better, though.  A dog will, like, clear out its own asshole.  And then the owner will do the give me a kiss thing.  Kisses.  Kisses.  The tongue was just up its own ass for the last ten minutes.  If you watch a dog sit, if a dog sat with its tail underneath it, so its tail was covering its asshole, that would be one thing.  But dogs will sit on the couch with that fucking brown asshole just sitting on your cushion. 
[01:03:30]  And then it'll get up, or sometimes you'll chase him away.  Hey, shoo, doggy, shoo.  I want to lay there.  And then you'll lay your head right down where dog asshole was.  Well, that's why you've got to do, when a dog gets up on the couch, what you do is you grab its tail, and you fucking wet your finger, and you stick it in the asshole, and then you smell it.  Why?  Because if it don't smell, you could stay.  But if it smells, you've got to fucking boot him off the fucking sofa.  Oh, my God.  What makes people think dogs don't need to wipe their fucking ass? 
[01:04:00]  You wet your finger, you fucking poke it deep into the, and I mean, until the webbing in your finger hurts.  That's how far in the eye push it.  That's pretty far.  That sure is.  Until the webbing hurts.  You ever put a finger in someone's ass so far, your webbing hurts?  Oh, my God, Jamie.  And now you have two choices.  Either fucking put another finger in there and begin some proper stretching, or fucking pull your finger out and go wash it.  Worsh.  Worsh.  Holy shit, dude. 
[01:04:30]  We go to Indy.  Eric, what's up?  Yeah, man, you guys fucking ruined Johnny Cash's hurt for me with the fucking do-you nonsense or whatever.  Did ya?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's definitely, uh...  It's like fucking impossible to listen to now, man.  Oh, you got a little...  Is this the actual bit?  Oh, just a song.  Never mind.  All right, thank you, sir.  Joe in Texas.  Joe.  Jimmy ruined Iron Man for me.  I cannot listen to that song without picturing some little pudgy kid walking down the sidewalk with a boombox on his shoulder. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, yeah, trying to go past this girl's place so she's here to the cool part.  Yeah.  Like I was Iron Man, too.  Like it was just a coincidence.  Oh, right.  You got there just in time for the cool part of Iron Man.  She'd have been called I Am Mush.  Then that would have been me.  Mush Man.  Aw.  Let's go to Dan in Houston.  Dan?  Yeah, you guys ruined Top Gun.  Well, ever since I was six years old, I loved that movie.  It made me want to be a pilot, and now I can't watch it without feeling like a complete homosexual.  Homosexual.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We're playing volleyball without a shirt on.  Everyone take their shirts off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Playing with the boys.  So gay.  Tom Cruise, he's tall.  Yeah.  Giant.  He broke five feet, I heard.  I tap out at four foot two.  I got blocks under my heels.  Same joke, all day. 
[01:06:00]  Shoe lifts and a wig.  That's right.  Without my shoe lifts and a wig, I'm four foot one.  When I put them together, I'm six eight.  Six eight.  It's a big wig.  Top of the head's puffy, isn't it?  Yeah.  Sometimes a ceiling fan will catch my wig and spin me in a circle.  Knock me into the buffet.  Let's say hi to Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  I got to wear moon boots.  What's up, Dave?  Yeah, I can't eat pizza anymore because every time I do, I think of Joe Nicolicki. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, he can't.  Oh, pizza grease.  You ruined pizza grease.  Yeah.  Sometimes then you pat the grease on the top of a pizza.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  I got engine oil all over my wig.  I hand it to Liam Neeson.  He cut it so he looks like a retarded Chinese boy.  Let's go to Wes the Trucker.  Wes.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  You guys, like, these cars are kind of pushing out because you guys ruin more than movies.  You basically ruin our fucking lives. 
[01:07:00]  I mean, everything I do, I see a fat chick, I'm like, where'd you start 14?  I mean, every time I see a black person, I'm like, Obama president now.  Every time someone cuts me off, I hear Jimmy going, hey, stupid.  And everything the show does, it's like, it's just in our heads.  It's just 24-7.  Oh, right on, man.  Thanks, Wes.  All right.  I noticed that.  I do the same thing.  Yeah, Wackbag had a good time with this, so we figured we'd bring it to the show.  Let's go to Chris, another trucker.  Chris?  Hey, Jimmy just ruined fingering the dog's ass for me. 
[01:07:30]  Now when the webbing hurts, you're going to be thinking of Jimmy.  Ah, that's the worst.  The webbing.  Because the worst part is the dog always tries to scoot away.  So, like, when you have your finger all the way in the ass, your pointed finger and the  one next to your middle finger kind of dangling by the ball bag or vag, so you have to take  your left hand and hold its little back leg.  Or just hold its ball bag.  The next finger in the ass, and then the rest, you just hold its ball bag.  And pull backwards.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina. 
[01:08:00]  Sean?  Jimmy, you fucker.  I got hooked on a damn wire.  Got season one through five.  I was on disc two, season one, and you have Omar in studio and Jimmy.  Oh, man, when you got killed.  Do you like the show, though?  Oh, he doesn't want to talk to you.  And you still watching the wire?  No, you know something?  My DVDs are still there, but I kind of just stopped popping them in on season two.  Why?  I started watching other shit. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, but season two, you got to get past, because then it gets really good after that.  I know.  Go back.  You'll fall in love with season two, trust me.  I know.  It's okay.  Season two is okay, but compared to all the other seasons.  I have taken a break.  That was pretty brave on their part to do that whole, like, turnaround with season two.  Yeah.  Very brave, because they could have lost a lot of people through that.  Jay in Rhode Island.  Jay.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening.  My favorite band since I was about six years old was Van Halen.  How old am I now, Jay? 
[01:09:00]  What's up?  You guys suck.  You ruined Van Halen for that guy, yeah.  Roz, Connecticut.  Roz.  Anything that has to do with retards.  My wife's watching the Hallmark Channel.  I like turtles.  Nice.  Wow.  Look at this. 
[01:09:30]  Gooch in Cleveland.  Gooch.  What's up, fellas?  LeBron.  Yeah.  He's the man.  Yo.  He sure is.  You guys remember that story about the cops in Alabama that gave that guy a lie detector  test by putting a lampshade on his head?  Yes.  Yeah.  I relayed that to my friends and how hysterical it was, and about a week later, they had, like,  a little intervention with me to let me know what an asshole I was for laughing at that.  What?  I promptly told them to go fuck themselves.  So you lost friends because of this show?  I don't believe this story.  I lost friends because they were pricks anyway.  They were all unfunny assholes.  I don't believe this story. 
[01:10:00]  You ever get into a situation where someone wants to talk about, like, something we did  on the show, and I know in my own life, I'm like, no, no, no, not the time.  These people are not going to understand whatsoever.  My mother did with cherry darts.  She wanted to play.  Anybody that doesn't think that that lampshade on the head is funny is not a funny person.  Dude, how do you think I got through high school?  Lampshade on the head at the party, guy.  I pretend I was a lamp.  Go for Stu.  It says, Jimmy ruined me going into any emporium. 
[01:10:30]  I see the word emporium now, and I just think of Ted.  Rob in Long Island.  Ted O'Lark Lemon.  Robbie.  Yeah.  Rob, let's go.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't know you texted me.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy ruined dick sucking for me.  I can't go into a porch now without seeing his pudgy little face.  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba.  Ben's raw ass.  What's up?  Yeah, what's up?  You guys ruined the sixth sense for me, man. 
[01:11:00]  You've been dead all along.  Oh, that goes way back.  You didn't know that?  We fucked up that movie for people two years after it came out.  Two years after.  And they were pissed.  I'm like, what were you waiting for?  Like, yeah, yeah, it was dead the whole movie.  What?  Motherfogers.  That's a linger-longer right there.  I forgot about that.  Lady Chucker, what's going on?  Oh, well, you guys ruined a couple of my breakfasts.  Breakfasts?  Why?  Oh, you know, I get Bobby to puke and two girls, one cop. 
[01:11:30]  Well, it's a different kind of ruined things, but okay.  Yeah.  I don't get this one.  Carol in Texas.  Hey, you guys have ruined my life.  Why?  Ever since that audio porn stuff, now when I call my friends, I go, Carol, you fucking  whore.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that was a good one.  You dumb bitch.  You dumb bitch.  Love that shit.  Dumb cunt.  Do we suck at you, dumb cunt? 
[01:12:00]  We gotta get more of that.  Yeah, we got a few of those, I think.  We're almost ready to do another one of those.  Yeah, I think I had gotten to all, like, the good ones, but there were still a few that  I left untouched, so maybe we'll bring new stuff there.  Footer, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey, the word cunt is definitely ruined for me from this show.  Like, now it's just so easy to say cunt.  Like, my mother-in-law had something to say right away.  I'm like, oh, easy, you cunt.  I just wanted to shoot it out.  Well, sir, that's no way to talk.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch. 
[01:12:30]  Where's the Carol one?  I'm gonna come down your throat.  You fucking well better swallow it all.  You let one drop spill and I'll whip your ass so hard you won't sit down for a week.  My favorite, though.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  I'm gonna fuck you in the mouth.  And I got it, though.  This was the one.  Oh, yeah.  Carol, you fucking whore!  I want an actress.  I love that I'm gonna so hard you won't sit down for a week. 
[01:13:00]  For a week.  Marla.  Hey.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  My son, Will, got me started to listen to you guys.  I have a dog.  It's a 146-pound black Newfoundland.  Wow.  And he's neutered, so I can't do anything with his balls because he doesn't have any.  But I can't imagine licking my finger and sticking it up his ass.  You guys just ruined me and the relationship I've had with my dog.  150-pound Newfie.  Now how fucking, how much hair does that fucking thing shed? 
[01:13:30]  A lot.  A lot.  And he's gonna keep growing for another year and a half.  How much shit just hangs from the fucking hair around its asshole?  Okay.  I love you guys.  We went too far for her.  She got shit wind chimes hanging from its fucking ass.  That fucking thing probably sheds like a cancer patient and a paint shaker.  Jesus.  Let's go to Kristen in Georgia.  Kristen.  Hey, boys.  Y'all have ruined sex for me because now whenever I'm having sex with my husband, I just want 
[01:14:00]  to start screaming, oh, Bill.  And his name's Adam, so that's kind of a problem.  So do the words that reverse, whatever they're called, say, madam in Eden, I'm Adam.  And then tell him that if you reverse that, it's spelled exactly the same way.  He'll come instantly.  All right.  Let's go to Greg in Chicago.  Greg.  Greg.  Guys, you've ruined my outlook on life.  Now, I go back to when you guys were on the air in Chicago before they got stupid and canceled 
[01:14:30]  the show.  Right.  I've been listening to you guys nonstop since I got my new car last year.  I can't look at anyone without thinking of something from the show, whether it's, hey,  stupid when I'm driving, or, hmm, I wonder what your balloon knot's like.  I can't.  I literally cannot stop.  Now, on the other hand, you've made me laugh like I haven't laughed in years.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, thanks.  Thanks for listening to the show. 
[01:15:00]  We appreciate it.  Oh, here's a good one.  Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  That guy had nothing.  Yeah, you guys ruined me going to church from a long time ago.  What do you mean?  Oh, the whole.  We got it.  Sam, I keep on looking for places that have sex in the church.  Oh, that.  Oh, ho.  Let's go to Greg in Florida.  Greg.  Hey.  Hey.  Come on, Greg.  What's going on?  Tell Carol and Mike you're going to smoke, regardless of whether they like it.  Tell her to jerk that fruit off with Wesson oil. 
[01:15:30]  I just want to say, yeah, you guys ruined a relationship of mine.  Why?  How?  Well, I went about two years ago.  I went through about six months where everything my girl would say, it was always responded with an aria.  Did you?  She just got tired of it and left.  Did she?  She did.  Did she?  Crunk it.  Let's go to Chris in the islands.  Nile is checking in.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, guys.  You guys ruined the memory of my dead father, whose name was Ramon. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Ramon, rot.  Oh, my God.  Ramon, grow fingernails and hair for longer than you need them.  Oh, God.  Ramon, has your jaw dropped?  Ramon, be dug up and fucked by the coroner one more time. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Ramon, hug your mother and appreciate her.  Ramon, you know how silly a skeleton looks in a suit.  Ramon, kneel by the tombstone and talk to it.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Alex in Binghamton.  Alex?  Yeah.  Alex!  You guys ruined eggnog for me for life. 
[01:17:00]  Baby bird.  That's true.  Baby bird.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Grove in Maine.  Grove?  Grove.  Yeah.  Grove.  Yeah, you ruined breakfast for me in my Jimmy Gene sausage.  Sausage.  Sausage.  I missed that.  I missed that.  Sausage.  Have we played that in a while?  Sausage.  How long is the prank?  It's not even a prank call.  I can't even hear Jimmy Gene sausage without thinking of that anymore. 
[01:17:30]  We haven't played in so long.  Sausage.  We like one time.  Sausages.  Sausages.  Ben in Arizona.  Ben.  Yeah.  He has a ruined list for me.  Every time, you know, someone says, what other things we got?  Me and my dad and my brother.  No.  Cool.  For anything.  Yeah.  Mo.  Thank you, sir.  Hi.  We're going to play the Jimmy Dean sausage.  Sausages.  We haven't played this in a while.  We might stop it, but let's go. 
[01:18:00]  This guy is complaining about the size of his sausage.  That little 12-ounce goddamn roll of sausage is supposed to feed your brother and me and  you, 600 pounds of men, at least.  You get my point?  And the two girls, and they put it in that pussy roll of sausage.  Son of a bitch.  Somebody needs their ass kicked.  Some little consumer geek-a-roid.  Save money.  Save money.  Yeah.  Save money.  Save money.  I'm going to eat, goddammit. 
[01:18:30]  Randy Taylor.  I don't know where you people come from.  I don't know if you test your products, your quantity of your product.  Your products are very delicious.  Love your sausage for 30-something years, but I can't take and feed a family of five on  a little 12-ounce roll of sausage.  I don't mind paying you more money for your 16-ounce roll of sausage.  But you don't have it anymore.  You've got a 12-ounce roll, and you've got three men that weigh over 200 pounds apiece,  a woman that's a little plump stops girl, and a daughter who's 13, and you're going to try 
[01:19:00]  to take a 12-ounce roll of sausage and a couple of dozen eggs and feed that.  It ain't going to work.  And I'm not going to purchase your product anymore or ever again.  And as far as your 16-ounce and maple and sage, I don't eat that.  I'm not from the north.  I'm a Texas man.  Jimmy Dean sausage is for southern people to eat with the breakfast with the fried eggs  and the T-bone steaks.  And I can't see going to a little 12-ounce package that feeds four, five, six people. 
[01:19:30]  And I'm not going to buy two of those 12-ounce packages just because you want to downsize  and charge the same goddamn price.  I'd sure like a reply, and I'd sure like you to go back to your 16-ounce package on your  regular sausage because I'm not going to buy it.  Otherwise, ever again, I'll just have my own damn sausage made like I used to 30-something  years ago.  It's not as tasty as yours is, but it'll work. 
[01:20:00]  Goodbye.  What an ass.  What a fool.  Not as tasty.  He would probably eat fucking, like, deer intestines and just tell everybody that it  was sausage.  Gave him a compliment on his sausage.  Nice taste.  I don't know.  You think this guy likes sausage?  It's kind of weird.  Jimmy Dean?  He's obsessed with it.  Sausage.  Your 12-ounce package.  Package.  Package.  He's a plump Scotch.  Yeah.  Scotch woman.  Yeah, we all over 200 pounds, and instead of doing an ounce of exercise, we want you to  sell your bigger packages of sausage. 
[01:20:30]  I got a daughter who's a fat fuck, too.  You know she's a pig.  Oh, of course she is.  Fucking bunch of oinkers.  She's 13.  Standing around a trough.  Doesn't he eat T-bone steaks, too?  Yeah.  In the morning.  In the morning.  He's in Texas, man.  Texas.  Yeah.  Fried eggs and T-bone steaks.  Got to be said, not from the north.  Got to be said, CokeLogic's animation to that.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  This was a good one.  I forgot about that.  One of the best ones ever.  Sausage.  I wonder what happened with that guy.  Yeah.  I got an update on sausage.  He probably died of a massive coronary. 
[01:21:00]  Hop his mouth was fucked going to a home invasion.  Filled with black sausage.  Buy a black sausage.  Buy a Haitian sausage.  Ted the Trucker.  Oh, great.  Hi, Ted the Trucker.  What are you hauling?  Good evening.  Sausage.  Hauling classified military stuff.  But, Anthony, a couple of weeks ago, you completely ruined my niece's recital for me. 
[01:21:30]  Uh-oh.  Why?  How?  Yeah.  During the entire recital, the only thing I could think of was Anthony doing his little  toodaloo through the entire thing.  Toodaloo.  Toodaloo.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sam, in just a little bit, we're going to be discussing Anthony's hair care treatments.  Yes.  Anthony got hair follicle implants.  Some called them hair plugs.  He doesn't take too kindly to that. 
[01:22:00]  But that leads to some jokes about my hair and my father's facial hair choices.  And we should watch out because, in all seriousness, every time we air a bit involving my dad,  he asks if there are any royalties involved.  You can't just take fame, you know, like anybody else.  Like, enjoy that you're being noticed.  Like me, you can say it.  Like me.  Well, I didn't want to get in between father and son, but, you know.  Stay tuned.  It's all.  Sam, in this segment, a good comedian friend of ours, Joe DeRosa, is in studio.  Yeah.  And this was around the time when Anthony started getting work done on his hair. 
[01:22:30]  He got a follicle implant, so he says, which many people refer to as hair plugs.  Joe DeRosa was making fun of him.  Hair jokes led to me coming in studio, led to me explaining about my father's choice in facial hair,  and I believe led to my father, the fame whore himself, calling in.  Oh, he's calling in right now.  Do you want to take this call or just want to go to the bit?  He's calling into this show?  Right now.  We're not, we can't take phone calls.  We're introing bits.  Your dad knows.  Oh, Jesus.  You gave him the hotline. 
[01:23:00]  Let's just go to the bit.  I'll talk to him offline.  All right.  How does Joe Biden sleep with his eyes open?  How does this guy sleep at night?  Those eyes can't possibly close.  Oh, because of his tight skin.  Oh, my God.  Why, he has a wonderful hairdo.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  That is what is called.  He got hair plugs like Anthony did. 
[01:23:30]  No, he didn't.  He got hair plugs when they were called plugs.  They're fucking.  I have individual follicles that were placed from the area in the back of my head individually.  Uh-huh.  Just like your hair grows.  Can I see?  A harvest area.  They got the.  From the harvest area.  They got the plugs from the harvesting area?  Yes.  And then not plugs.  You said yes.  No, they're not plugs.  You tricked me.  Plugs were big rings of multiple hairs, like a hundred of them. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  This procedure is individual follicles that are placed in the thinning area.  And just like your hair grows, they're put in exactly like that.  The same grain, the same direction.  If you're, you know, your hair grows in a certain direction.  If you have it facing the wrong way, it's going to look silly.  You're not going to be able to brush it.  So they take that into consideration.  The natural hairline with these single follicles.  If you're thinning in the front.  Not plugs.  Plugs are what Joe Biden's got. 
[01:24:30]  So they're single plugs, then.  No.  They don't even use the word plug.  Tiny plugs.  It's for me, when I say it, to get treatment.  No, I'm kidding.  Biden's plugs are actually held in with flesh-colored thumbtacks.  Those are horrendous.  It's the worst hairdo ever.  That's horrible.  Isn't it terrible?  He looks like John Forsythe after he got caught in a flash fire.  He looks like one of those guys that ran out of money.  You see him as you're walking around.  Oh, yeah.  The guy that went broke.  He's like, well, I was working on it.  Looks like one of the guys from Trading Places at the end of the movie.  Mortimer. 
[01:25:00]  Can I see your hair?  Oh, it's not ready for a debut yet.  It doesn't show anybody.  He's greasing.  I've got to wait another two months, and then it'll start really growing in.  It's the problem with plugs.  It takes a fucking while.  It's not plugs.  They're individual follicles.  Some have one coming out of the single follicle.  Others have two, and some have three.  They use the single ones on the front to really give that nice, natural hairline.  And then the three at a time, which comes out of one follicle, but three hairs. 
[01:25:30]  It's a miracle.  They put in the back to really fill it out.  Is the other key difference that you have to wear a hat or a bandana for the rest of your life?  For a little like a fucking year.  A little steamy.  I'm definitely noticing something's like some bristles.  Could you take your hat off?  We don't have to look at the top of your head.  I just want to see what your hairdo looks like.  No, because it's really messy.  You know what I did?  It's so bad.  I spray this stuff on.  Oh, the spray hair?  No, not spray hair.  No! 
[01:26:00]  A guy will stand over you, and it comes in a flesh-colored pump.  Yes!  It smells like chlorine.  So you're using that spray hair to that?  No!  I don't know.  It's a spray that aids in the...  Oh, the black spray that makes your hair look fuller.  No!  You should just buy the hat.  No!  You should just buy the hat with the hair stapled to the back of it.  The mullet baseball cap. 
[01:26:30]  It's fucking Mike Myers' fucking hat in Wayne's world.  Especially when they redid it recently for MTV or whatever it was.  Oh, God.  No!  There's nothing worse than Fat Wayne.  Because he's just all fat.  Oh, I know, yeah.  He's not a kid.  He was a fun interviewer.  No, no.  It's...  Oh, God.  Pulling teeth.  Oh, Steve Martin's wonderful.  Oh, why don't you die in a fucking boating accident?  All right, so...  No, it's really bad.  But I have to get my hair cut for Little Warren Dean's christening. 
[01:27:00]  So after that, I will let you see.  Because it just looks too fucking bad right now.  Can't we see it messy?  No, no, no.  That's great.  No, because you know what it is?  It's all, like, greasy and under my hat and everything.  That's great.  No, it's horrid.  You have fucking...  You have drifter hair.  Yes, I do drifter hair.  I have hobo hair.  I said hobo.  Are you the hitchhiker?  Hobo hair.  Yes.  Are you going to take us into torrid tales with twists of fate? 
[01:27:30]  I've noticed.  It's like little bristles.  It comes in.  It's amazing.  But it takes, you know...  You're really not going to be able to notice for four to six months or 30 years.  Yeah.  Like four to six months.  It takes a while because you implant in the follicle and then it's got to grow.  And you can't fucking force hair to grow.  Sure you can.  It just takes a while.  No, you can't.  Yell at it.  It's like a tree.  You talk to it like a plant.  No.  Anthony, is it true? 
[01:28:00]  If you can see Anthony's plugs today, we have six more weeks of winter.  No!  They're not plugs.  It was individual follicles to fill in the thinning areas.  Yes.  Anthony pops his head out.  If somebody tries to comb something, it's six more weeks of winter.  See, I noticed when I was on video, and then the lights right over your head, you notice  like you could see a bright spot of scalp.  So I wanted that taken care of.  That's where I got the black spray paint.  You're good.  No, I don't get black spray paint.  I didn't want to do the black spray paint. 
[01:28:30]  And so I went for a sharpie.  You just used a sharpie.  A medical hair restoration.  I didn't use a sharpie.  He's a Puerto Rican with a can of black spray paint.  Like in Taken.  The sharpie head.  You can draw that sharpie line in like Homer.  Yes.  You have that zigzag around.  All right, let's take a look.  Why don't you borrow Liam Neeson's wig?  Yeah.  That's a lovely coat.  We don't need a wig.  Yeah.  We don't have to see the top of your head.  I just want to like take your hat off.  You can even move back.  So we don't have to study.  No, it really isn't because it would be a misconception.  Because I think you have like some kind of weird mullet going on now because there's 
[01:29:00]  different lengths of hair.  No, it's very like there's a lot on the sides and the back.  And then like on the top, it's very short.  So cut everything.  No, because I just want to get a regular haircut on the sides and the back and stuff and the front  and then leave like that area that was thinning because it's growing in.  I don't want to, you know, I want it to feel good about itself.  I don't want to go, oh, now I'm going to, you know, you're just starting to sprout out.  Now I'm going to cut you off.  But it's under a hat.  Does that make it harder for it to grow? 
[01:29:30]  No, it's genetic.  It's all genetic.  And I take the hat off once I, you know, leave the studio.  There's no sunshine on your head.  Yeah.  I get in my truck and the hat goes to the passenger seat and I drive home looking silly.  Right.  I look like a madman when I yell at fucking certain ethnic people that can't drive.  You have hat head and if it's a greasy and matted and some of it's missing.  And I like try to take my fingers and pull it back and I just look like fucking Count Dracula  and I'm yelling at people.  That's fantastic.  That's bad for plugs.  You can rip them out.  They're not plugged.  No, I could tug on my fucking hair because it's your natural hair. 
[01:30:00]  Once it's in, it's done.  It's a done deal.  It's in.  They can't come out.  It's not a wig.  It's not a fucking hair system.  It's my natural growing hair.  I could cut it, color it, do whatever I want with it.  Except touch it.  No, you could do anything.  They put Anthony's hair in like the fucking pegs in Battleship.  No, that's not, that's plugs and it's not plugs.  It's individual follicles.  It's like fiber optics.  More than that.  Call it whatever you want to make yourself feel better. 
[01:30:30]  No, it's not plugs.  They say plugs.  Where are your pals?  You watch the commercials for it and they show you what old plugs were.  They were literally cookie cutter plugs that they pulled out of your head and just put  on top because they weren't worried about what your scalp or hairline looked like.  They hoped, well, the hair that was growing would cover that up.  But this, you can look right down on the scalp and not even notice.  See, people think that hair replacement treatment looks bad because they've only seen bad ones. 
[01:31:00]  The good ones, you don't even notice because you don't notice it because it looks natural.  That's why I went to medical hair restoration and got the thinning areas in the back of  my head filled in.  That's what they call this?  We all believe that you got this futuristic treatment that nobody's ever heard of before.  No, it's not futuristic.  It's an improvement over the years upon the initial idea that hair can be transplanted from  an area that is genetically engineered not to fall out to areas that genetically do get 
[01:31:30]  affected with male pattern baldness.  Your method was actually one step below shaving your mustache and taping it to the area.  It was not.  It was wonderful.  Sprigling pubes on super glue.  It took one day.  It took one day.  And then within a week, you couldn't even notice I had had anything done.  And then in time, it grows in and I'm noticing it growing in.  It's not plugs.  It's not surgery. 
[01:32:00]  You're not put under.  It's nothing like that.  You watch movies when it's...  When do we get the big reveal, man?  Yeah, there's some discomfort occasionally.  Can we at least set a date for the big reveal?  Because we're all curious.  Well, after little Warren Dean's christening.  I'm paying close attention there, Joe, because if it works for Ant...  You don't have a problem, do you?  I'm getting there.  Are you really?  Give me another year or two and I'll be the guy yelling and screaming that they're not plugs.  You know what I did do the other day?  First time ever. 
[01:32:30]  I bought a hairbrush.  What's that?  I haven't combed my hair since I was 12.  I actually brushed my hair and I haven't done that in centuries.  I just haven't.  Do you just brush your hair in front of a big mirror?  I sit there and play the Happy Days music and use a comb and then I just go, hey, it's good.  Wait, do you count?  One, two...  Yeah, I'm Marsha Brady, a hundred strokes.  A hundred strokes.  On my cock, you fucking fat whore.  You blow a fan at your head so it's flowing?  Yes, I want Fabio hair. 
[01:33:00]  That's what I want to grow in.  That's the way to do it.  No, I just, because hair is growing in.  I see it.  All right.  And I want to, you know, get some kind of hairstyle.  I don't know what I do.  I usually, I used to just leave it.  You see it, huh?  I would shower.  You also hear voices.  And then, the voices are real.  Oh, okay.  They're telling me the war is coming.  Why is Sam still standing there?  Sam's got hair.  I could show you pictures, Sam.  I had hair like that.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  So, you can look forward to a great future of having follicles implanted in your head, too.  Oh, how great would Sam look with a big bald spot?  Oh, it would be great.  It doesn't happen to everyone.  I would love that.  I want to put a handlebar mustache on you.  Why?  Can we get at least a fake one for some pictures?  I guess so.  I guess so.  So, you look like dear old dad.  His dad has a handlebar mustache, Joe.  Really?  For real.  That's awesome.  He's old school.  He's had it for, what, 30, 40 years?  Yes.  It doesn't reject it.  They don't reject.  It's fine.  They're in there and they're growing and it's done. 
[01:34:00]  It's not, like, going to pop out and reject.  It's not a kidney, fucko.  Sorry.  Had to straighten that guy's shit out.  Wait, how come your dad has a handlebar mustache?  I guess it might.  He juggles at Disney.  Who the fuck else has a handlebar mustache these days?  He's a weightlifter in 1910.  Does he run a candy store?  No.  It's a new one.  He's got to head to the list. 
[01:34:30]  I'm assuming it was in style when he grew it.  It was never in style.  It might have been.  The handlebar mustache was never in style.  Those were the rebels, man.  Those were the guys just doing their thing.  In, like, the Old West pictures.  That's the only time I've seen it.  Well, maybe he was, like, a younger guy and he saw those Old West pictures and he's like,  No.  Yeah, badass.  No.  No.  Yeah.  What, is your dad tying someone to the railroad tracks?  Does your dad ever say,  No.  Does he demand rent from young women or old ladies? 
[01:35:00]  He's not evil.  Never threaten tying to the train track.  Does he go around shutting down orphanages?  Yeah.  No.  Does he have a cape?  Does he ever pull it up over his face and walk away very snidely?  He doesn't have a cape.  No?  Or a hat.  All right.  No hat?  A little, like, stovepipe type hat?  No, he does not.  He just has his handlebar mustache.  He doesn't do change very well, so he grew it at one point and then he realized if he shaved 
[01:35:30]  it, it would be a change, so he didn't.  Plus, it goes really good with his monocle.  Yeah.  He'd have a monocle?  He has glasses.  That's good.  Two lenses.  The handlebar mustache just touches the surface as far as Sam's dad goes.  Yeah.  He drinks what?  Buttermilk?  Yeah, he drinks buttermilk.  Buttermilk?  What the?  Your father fucking is...  He took a time machine.  Wait, buttermilk, like, all day?  Well, not like all day, but he will sit down on a Sunday and have a glass of buttermilk.  If everybody's having a glass of milk, he will have a glass of buttermilk. 
[01:36:00]  What's he trying to look like?  The guy on the chance cards in Monopoly?  Does he...  Does he...  Is he drinking buttermilk with a fucking mustache?  Well, he must have a throat-clearing nasal sinus.  Oh, shit.  Buttermilk is so...  Gummy.  Thick.  You're just filled with fat.  You can't get more fat snores.  Does he like putting salt in it?  No.  Does your family often gather on a Sunday afternoon for a nice glass of milk?  Buttermilk.  No.  He sits around...  What's the other thing he does?  Strows it on his back.  I went... 
[01:36:30]  I had the THR out on that one, too.  I know how that started.  Sam was young, and he went, Danny, what's that in your mustache?  And he went, how about her buttermilk?  That's buttermilk.  That's buttermilk.  And now he has to drink it.  It was buttermilk.  And then it was in his mustache, so he just twisted it up into a handlebar as an excuse.  How come every time the black gardener leaves, you have buttermilk in your mustache?  Oh, God.  I didn't have a lisp. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, yeah.  What else does he do?  There's one other thing that shocked me.  Sardines out of the can.  Horrendous.  These are oldie things.  Jesus.  These are oldie time things.  What, is he a hobo?  Yeah.  He's got the bandana tied to the end of a sticker, waiting for a freight train.  He's a stocking cat.  He's like that Bub and Pee Wee's Big Adventure.  Well, that is just amazing.  It's just, that's what he likes. 
[01:37:30]  There's your dad.  There's a picture of a guy with a handlebar mustache, a monocle, and one of those Shemp Howard hairdos that are just greased and parted in the middle.  Sam's father once shot a man for snoring.  Just for snoring.  In the Time Live books.  Is he hoping to get money off O.J. Simpson?  No.  But he is hoping that the same thing happens to his worthless son.  Oh, wow.  What the?  That's not true either.  Nice. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, that is an oldie time look.  You've got to admit.  It's coming back, though.  No, it's not.  Are you sure?  Dude, it was never happened.  What'd you get him for Christmas?  Spats.  When you would bring home a black girl, would your father go?  Does your dad stand with his hands on his hips?  How old school is he?  If you bring home a black girlfriend, would your father go, who's the belly warmer?  Is this really Sam's dad?  Oh, shit.  What? 
[01:38:30]  Sam's dad.  He probably is.  Sam's dad.  Where?  Hello?  Hello?  You're on the air, sir.  Hello?  Hi.  Oh, shit.  This is Sam's dad for real.  Do I get residuals for this or what?  Hey, what's with the mustache?  I'm an old person.  Jesus.  What's with the mustache, Sam's dad?  The mustache has always been there.  I was way back when I started.  I had a bit of an ego problem, so that was a cheap way to get it. 
[01:39:00]  And it never left.  Cheap way to get what?  Like an ego?  An ego, sure.  You look important when you have a handlebar mustache.  Wow, he's got to be someone.  Really?  Yeah.  In what year, though?  I mean, you know.  What year?  Yeah, it's like that's a...  You might as well just shave it into a Hitler.  This was in the mid-60s.  Mid-60s.  It probably really didn't go.  Like, there were hippies and...  You wouldn't believe the action I got in the mid-60s.  With a handlebar mustache?  With a handlebar mustache? 
[01:39:30]  Including, you might be interested to know, Sam's mother.  Oh!  Oh, Sam!  Oh, come on!  Damn!  Sam, your dad got action with the handlebar mustache.  How does that make you feel?  Awkward and uncomfortable.  Oh, God.  I can only imagine in the mid-60s what that must have looked like.  It looked like two Bigfoot fighting.  It's kind of similar to the action that Sam gets with his hair now, right?  Oh, see?  Oh, a little, uh, yeah.  People think I'm important because I got a unique hairstyle. 
[01:40:00]  Did your dad ever tell you, like, Dad, could you shave the mustache, Sam?  If it wasn't for this mustache, you wouldn't be here.  Yeah.  This is how it all happened.  Your mom like this mustache.  Hey, Sam's dad, what's up with the buttermilk?  Listen, you guys don't understand.  Buttermilk is one of the great treats of all time.  When he drinks buttermilk, when I started as a kid, I used to drink buttermilk with  crumbled up saltine crackers.  Holy mother of God. 
[01:40:30]  Disgusting.  Isn't it?  Great treat.  So the best lunch in the world, which Sam has probably already done me in on already,  I'm sure, is sardines with a dill pickle, glass of buttermilk on bread, and it doesn't  get much better.  And a little view into the Nickelodeon.  How bad are your farts, Sam?  Oh, wow.  Buttermilk.  Imagine if he was lactose intolerant, too.  Buttermilk, sardines, pickles, and what? 
[01:41:00]  He's shitting, and the sardines are swimming upstream back up his asshole like salmon.  Buttermilk is the buttermilk.  It's the left.  There's no issue of fat.  There's no issue of calories or none of that stuff.  It's just great stuff.  We got a picture of Sam's dad's bike up on us.  That's not my dad.  It's got a big screen.  The huge wheel up front, the little one in the back.  We don't have a bike like that in my house.  No?  I got nervous that he was calling to challenge one of us to a duel. 
[01:41:30]  That's where I got eating raw potatoes from.  What?  You guys eat raw potatoes at your house, too?  He told me that was another one of the great treats of all time.  Great treats of all time.  Ladies and gentlemen, one of the great treats of all time.  Why is that a great treat?  Your father's a newsreel.  To make the phone call into the show, he had to crank his phone and get the operator to plug that jack into the wall.  Operator, get me Murray Hill 5-6262.  That's Murray Hill 5-6262. 
[01:42:00]  Yes.  Sir, I didn't have time to listen to the news today.  What did Walter Winchell have to say?  What did he dish about Hollywood this morning?  All I'm trying to do, and there are a few of us around that are trying to maintain standards, even bring some back.  But no, no, we have to be the butt of this sort of tawdry humor.  I don't think that one's going to catch on, though.  It's one of those things that kind of is just in history and kind of remains there, like the Hitler mustaches.  It's a man of great class has a handlebar mustache. 
[01:42:30]  That's true.  And here are our brave doughboys sipping off for Europe.  Does your mom like the handlebar mustache, Sam?  They'll beat the Kaiser.  What does mom think of the mustache?  I think she likes the mustache like my girlfriend likes my afro, in that it's just been there for so long at this point.  Yeah.  She puts up with it.  She's trying to hire Joaquin Phoenix to take it off, like Nicole Kidman did.  Matt Dillon.  Too obscure.  Get it?  All right, Sam.  Listen, yeah, I have to go. 
[01:43:00]  I have important things to do.  Drinking buttermilk, eating potatoes.  Sardines, pickles.  How much is mustache wax?  Actually, I don't use mustache wax anymore.  What do you use?  It's just natural.  Snot?  Buttermilk?  I used to, but that was a long time ago.  Do you have to leave now?  Are you running some bootlegged liquor?  All right, Sam's dad.  You guys get back to more moral uplift there.  Oh! 
[01:43:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Damn.  We'll see you.  Just take it easy.  All right.  Sam's dad, everyone.  Great.  Boy, he's a big smartass like you, huh?  You got called out on that one.  That's good.  What, did he have to tend to the still?  Everything Sam's dad does is in fast motion.  Is he going to beat you with a stitch because we'd be in front of you?  I bet everything, you know, the most modern camera, when you take pictures of him, it's 
[01:44:00]  just all grainy.  I was about to.  It's got scratches in it.  Like a brand new camera.  He's all in fast motion with grainy scratches.  I was trying to work some grainy joke I couldn't get to.  His dad has the only digital camera that you need to throw like a little cape over yourself  at.  Yes.  That smile.  Poof.  Yeah, he's got to hold that big thing.  Big thing of gunpowder.  Now remember, hold still.  Here we are with Sam's father in Times Square.  It's victory over Europe day.  Now if we can only defeat the Japs.  Okay.  That shouldn't take too long. 
[01:44:30]  Here he is making out with Sam's mother.  I wonder if a little Sam will be made today.  This conversation is ridiculous because if you weren't here, he wouldn't know.  What does he do for New Year's Eve?  Zip his ball bag up in his zipper on purpose?  One of the greatest treats the world ever knows.  Sometimes I just need to feel good.  He's got a bit lighter by his penis.  Oh, shit.  Did you ever catch him coming down for buttermilk with a little candle in that little thing 
[01:45:00]  you hold with your finger and the stocking cap?  Did he tell you stories about Jacob Marley?  There we go.  Your dad acts like it's the 1800s.  It's a simpler time.  Well, he wasn't even alive.  From everything.  He's like his snacks.  He's not even that old?  No.  His snacks and his mustache.  He's a history buff.  And so I think he just.  Is he?  Yeah.  He kind of gets into that whole thing?  He just fell into a simpler time.  A simpler time.  We line up this shit tomorrow.  It's going to. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, horrific.  Fucking buttermilk.  With saltines crushed in it.  Saltines crushed.  It's like everything that shouldn't be mixed is mixed.  And he eats all this at the same time?  Yeah.  That's a meal.  That is a meal that you give like orphans in the little rascals.  Orphans.  That's when they're trying to get away.  Your dog wouldn't even eat that.  He tried to.  Don't drink the milk.  It's spoiled.  He tried to sell my girlfriend on what a treat buttermilk was.  And I was over there going, yeah, it's really good.  You should try some.  Why are you trying to do that?  You know what that would do to a girl?  She tried it.  The next day she'd be fucking huge.  Yeah, she was having awful gassers. 
[01:46:00]  She tried a sip and didn't enjoy it.  No?  No.  Did she try it with the crackers in it?  No.  We didn't put any.  Maybe that was a problem.  Oh, well.  It's not the best treat the world has ever known if you don't put crackers in it.  How thick is the buttermilk?  It's like.  How thick.  Is it like egg whites or more?  It's like quicksand.  It has to be.  Yeah, it's got to be.  It's probably twice as thick as whole milk.  Ugh.  Fucking buttermilk is horrible.  The thought of that is making me feel like one guy.  Like when I was watching that.  Like it's making me like that.  Like ugh.  I don't know. 
[01:46:30]  Fucking.  A raw potato?  Yeah, those are good.  They're not good.  No, they're not.  They're starchy fucking messes.  That's what they cook up.  Right.  If you want a treat like that, eat an apple.  At least it's sweet.  It's got the same kind of consistency almost.  Who's he raised by?  Wolves?  His father was raised by wolves.  The buttermilk with the crackers tastes like the nipple milk of a wolf.  How do you eat a raw potato?  Like how do you, what do you do with it?  Well, you could slice it up or not.  You don't need to.  Like in chips?  Like chips?  Yeah, you just, you could, but you don't have to. 
[01:47:00]  Do you skin it?  Yeah, you definitely skin it.  You skin it.  Oh, well, that's crazy not to.  Of course.  Now salt it.  What are you, insane at it?  Yeah, you put some salt on it.  Yeah.  What are you dipping in?  Vodka?  What the fuck's the matter?  No, you just, you know.  It's crazy.  Cold water so it's nice and chilled.  Cold and put some salt on it and you just take a bite of a potato.  And then you and dad sit down.  Eating some, you know, raw potatoes.  Watch Mary Pickford in her latest picture.  America's Sweetheart.  No talkies allowed in that house.  All right, we got it.  I wish he'd pull a fatty Arbuckle with your asshole. 
[01:47:30]  With a bottle?  Yes.  The old Coke bottle.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, he pink-socked that cunt.  He sure did.  Jesus.  She had it coming.  Yes, she did.  You want to fuck the funny man?  Take the punishment.  That's what you get, toots.  Toots.  Let's get a handlebar asshole.  What else is old Iron Stomach like?  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  He's one of those guys that can just probably drink a lot without puking.  He's one of those guys that just has an Iron Stomach.  Nothing probably bothers him.  Does he like to drink a little bit? 
[01:48:00]  No, he did at a time.  He doesn't want any more.  Oh, so he quit.  At a time.  What did he drink?  I mean, he drinks beer now.  They're not like, he gets drunk once.  I've seen him drunk once.  Yeah?  All right.  Does he go smack you around?  That'd be cool.  Yeah, I bet he put Sam in the hospital.  He went up in jail for three weeks.  A couple of extra foot pounds per second per second.  I literally had one little afro hair on his fucking little head.  Is his favorite drink sarsaparilla?  Yeah.  I like birch beer. 
[01:48:30]  That's a good tonic.  That's a tonic.  Oh, get me some of those headache powders.  It's the worst of the O.P. Anthony show.  Sam, we're going to be discussing something that Jimmy absolutely despises.  Uh-huh.  Funny papers.  Comic strips.  Dilbert being one of them.  To be more specific.  And who's in studio for this coming up?  Our friend Otto Peterson.  Who else?  That's it.  Who?  O.P.  Sam Roberts.  Who?  Sam Roberts. 
[01:49:00]  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Yes, him.  Yours truly enters the studio.  And we return with Dilbert and comic strips.  The email I will get.  It's so much, Sam.  It's coming up next.  And by the way, if you want less, Sam, listen to a different show, baby.  Like special delivery.  That's right.  Sam, in this segment, we're joined by our good friend Otto Peterson, Sands George.  Of course.  And the discussion about comic strips, or the funny pages, comes up in a recent news piece 
[01:49:30]  that we were going over where Dilbert, if you know, he's a corporate comic character,  was going to be downsized, be fired.  Uh-huh.  And Jim thought this was just a complete piece of shit, that it wasn't funny, and thought  maybe we could fill in that final panel with funnier punchlines than the creator of Dilbert.  Well, this led to a bit of my own that was short-lived, but it was a lot of fun while  it lasted, where I was going through and finding good Dilbert comics for the host of the show 
[01:50:00]  to finish, and for the audience to finish.  Uh-huh.  And this is how it all began, I think.  Another bit where you shine.  Thank you, Eric.  Thank you for noticing.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Kill yourself.  Kill yourself.  On the virus.  Kill yourself.  Sirius XM.  Kill yourself.  I know Jimmy likes a good comic strip.  They're fucking so funny, man.  You enjoy a good comic strip.  Yeah, I do. 
[01:50:30]  And there's something going on with Dilbert that's making a lot of news today there, Jimmy.  Oh, what?  I miss you reading the comics, by the way.  It's been a while.  Nah, that's too funny.  I get all laughed out.  Sure.  Do you want me to tell you what happened to Dilbert, or should we play the audio and  have the big surprise?  Let's play it, because Dilbert always gets me.  He always catches me off guard.  Dilbert is what?  Is he like an office space type?  It's not office humor.  Office humor.  It's office humor.  Cubicle humor.  Or bosses and sub-bosses and all that kind of crap. 
[01:51:00]  Secretaries.  Paperwork.  Cubicle crap.  TPS reports.  PC load letter.  PC load letter.  I don't even know what the fuck that means.  I got to watch office space.  PC load letter.  That was the one.  I never was freaking out over it.  What the fuck?  I never got office space, and everyone's like, you're just-  You gotta watch it a couple of times.  You gotta watch it, yeah.  So I'm gonna give it another try, but-  Yeah.  Dilbert is in the news and his comic strip.  Listen to this.  And in a sure sign of the times, cartoon character Dilbert has been fired. 
[01:51:30]  Dilbert has been fired, Jimmy.  What did Dilbert do again?  Oh, no.  I think it's because of the economy, you know.  You gotta be relevant with your comic strip, right?  This has got people that are talking.  A symbol of the downtrodden worker, Dilbert, says, my side business, DilbertFiles.com, is  getting lots of attention.  I have a feeling I will soon be leaving my cubicle behind, all in favor of firing this  idiot for using company resources. 
[01:52:00]  What?  I don't even know what we just heard.  What was that?  What the fuck does that mean?  Yeah, no.  No, it's in parts, but-  Did Dilbert get fired?  Did he stop running that shitty comic strip?  Yeah, what happened?  Did the guy get fired?  Sam, you're making everyone angry today.  What the fuck is going on with Dilbert and his stupid comic strip?  What the fuck?  Well, you guys are probably just like-  Because it's very funny.  You gotta listen to it again.  What they did was they read-  That's such an asshole.  They read the Dilbert gets fired comic strip, and the last box of the three panels, the last 
[01:52:30]  panel is the- is his bosses saying, should we fire him?  And so that's where I ended the clip, so that way you guys could laugh and not-  Oh, oh, oh, and then we're gonna find out-  Right, and then there's some more audio after that, but I wanted to end the clip there, so  you guys had a minute to laugh.  But what is Dilbert-  To laugh?  Okay, thanks for putting a little break in this so we can laugh.  But wait, Dilbert-  Appreciate that.  They might fire the guy-  The character. 
[01:53:00]  Who gives a fuck?  Not the guy that writes the thing.  No, no, no, the character, Dilbert, is getting fired, so now we're gonna have to follow his  adventures-  Of trying to get a job.  Or misadventures.  Misadventures.  Of trying to get a job.  Fucking sad, man.  What does he do now?  He's gonna be sucking cock down in the meatpacking district.  How about Dagwood gets arrested for rape?  And fucking Blondie goes to defend him?  That'd be a great fucking strip.  Where Peppermint Patty is caught eating pussy.  He's fucking eating Lucy's ass in the doghouse. 
[01:53:30]  That'd be a great little twist in a comic strip.  Oh, wouldn't it?  Yeah.  Love to see that.  Where Marmaduke jumps into the family circus and fucks the kid's face.  You got chlamydia from Pigpen.  Doesn't wash his cock.  He's unclipped.  Why not look like a Polak?  So, let's take Sam's advice and let's replay this.  Yes!  Let's see where this is going.  Because he gives us time to laugh.  All right.  Now we got the setup.  Now this might make sense.  And in a sure sign of the times, cartoon character Dilbert has been fired. 
[01:54:00]  A symbol of the downtrodden worker, Dilbert says, my side business, DilbertFiles.com,  is getting lots of attention.  I have a feeling I will soon be leaving my cubicle behind.  All in favor of firing this idiot for using company resources.  Oh, so that was the panel with the bosses.  He's sitting there.  So, Dilbert's sitting there going, well, I've created this side business while I'm at work  that's going to enable me to leave my job and, you know, become a successful millionaire  on my own. 
[01:54:30]  Right.  Little does Dilbert know that in his head he's saying, I'm going to be out of here soon,  but he's going to be out a little sooner than he thinks.  Oh, Sam.  Wow, Sam.  The way you put it.  Right.  All right.  Scott Adams is the man, the cartoonist, and the blogger behind the character.  Scott, why did you pick this moment in time for Dilbert to lose his job?  Gee.  Boy, I wonder.  I wonder why.  Maybe because everyone's losing a job.  Holy shit.  And he wants to have Dilbert relate to the people, man. 
[01:55:00]  So, fuck.  It's the smart move.  Tessio was always smarter.  Dilbert was always smarter.  Dilbert.  Pick you up in front of Dilbert's joint in an hour.  This moment in time for Dilbert to lose his job, and quite frankly, he was using company  resources.  It's a terrible thing to lose a job, but didn't he deserve to get fired?  Well, you know, his company was slowing down just like everybody else's company is slowing  down, and he didn't have much to do, so he started a side business in his cubicle.  That guy sounds like Napoleon Dynamite. 
[01:55:30]  Which is what a lot of people believe.  He does.  He does sound like Napoleon Dynamite.  Dilbert should get it in the head like the Turk.  Why don't you just drop me on the way after, or whatever?  Business in his cubicle, which is, you know, what a lot of people did, including myself.  And he got caught.  So, it just seems like you had time to downsize him and let him see what it's like to try  to get a job in this economy.  God, what a bore. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, you know.  That's how it's like to get a job in this economy.  I mean, I'm with Sam here.  This is a treat for everyone.  Is he going to just, like, be looking for a job, or is he going to take a little time  off and hang around the house for a little while?  What do we see?  A lot of people are asking that question.  Are they, Sam?  And in this next track, we find out.  Wow, okay.  Does your dad enjoy a good comic strip when he's eating some of the greatest treats of  all time?  I don't know.  He does have the Sunday paper by his side while he's eating these treats. 
[01:56:30]  I bet he likes Beetle Bailey.  Some of those old comics that have been around for a thousand years.  Brenda Starr.  Brenda Starr still hot in comic strip form.  Is he going to get brought back really fast, or are you going to have a long-running storyline  where he's now looking for a job and get a lot of humor out of that?  I will tell you that, you know, I can't give away too much.  Oh!  I will tell you that when he comes back, it won't be in the same capacity.  So you guys, I can't wait to see him.  Oh, motherfucker. 
[01:57:00]  That's a cliffhanger.  Wow.  Now I've got to start reading the Dilbert comic.  We're going to learn three panels at a time.  For the next five years, we'll chronicle his fucking two job searches.  Three effing panels at a time.  Oh, fucking boring.  On Dilbert.com, there is...  Is there like a preview, a trailer for tomorrow's fucking panel?  Well, no, but there is a fun game.  It's called Are You Funnier Than Scott Adams?  And it basically gives you the last panel blank so that you can... 
[01:57:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I think we should have a little contest.  So if you'd like, I could print out some copies.  I'd like it a lot.  Can we do that?  And we could play a little game.  Let's play a little game.  Sounds fun, Dan.  Can the listeners play online?  They sure can.  They can go to Dilbert.com, and there's a link right on the homepage to Are You Funnier Than Scott Adams?  How about you pass out a bunch of them to our studio audience also?  Oh, yes.  Let's play Are You Funnier Than Scott Adams?  See if they're funnier than Scott Adams. 
[01:58:00]  Ooh, Scott Peterson is funnier than Scott Adams.  He certainly is.  So is Connor.  You go to Dilbert.com to play a lot.  Lacey Burt wasn't there.  Lacey Burt.  Oh, God.  She came up like sushi.  Wrapped in seaweed.  Jesus.  Oh, I'll have the young child.  Oh, God. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, God.  Damn.  Oh.  Oh, that's very funny.  Little wasabi head.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  What kind of a job do you guys think I'll end up being able to get?  Oh, Sam, let's see.  You can only imagine Sam.  A funny bone remover?  A boo.  All right.  So we're going to play Are You Funnier Than Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, the writer, 
[01:59:00]  the blogger.  He blogs about it.  Of course he does.  Bloggers are always very funny.  They're very funny people.  So we got the, you survived the rigorous interview process, but there are no openings in engineering.  Second panel with the building.  However, I'm prepared to offer you a position in sales.  Cigar body says you mean a job.  And now we got the third panel.  Well, as we play Are You Funnier Than Scott Adams, the creator and writer and blogger of Dilbert. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  First entry.  First entry is from Otto's friend.  Otto, you didn't introduce your friend.  Oh, that's Roger Sullivan over there.  Roger Sullivan.  Yeah.  From Hohocus.  Hohocus?  Yeah.  Where the hell's Hohocus?  It's north of Paramus.  I didn't know of a town called Hohocus.  Yeah.  Well, Danny, you want to read this?  You take the entries. 
[02:00:00]  Sure.  Are you funnier than Scott Adams?  So should I recap the whole panel again?  I did, but yeah, do it one more time.  What the hell?  So the first panel, Dogbert says to Dilbert, you survived the rigorous interview process, but there are no openings in engineering.  However, I am prepared to offer you a position in sales.  Dilbert replies, you mean a job.  And in this, our first entry in the Dilbert game here, Dogbert says no.  And Dilbert says, well, I guess I could deal pot. 
[02:00:30]  Mm-hmm.  Wait, what is he saying over there?  What?  You're hoping for a little something?  More than that?  Oh, wow.  I just thought it would be funny.  Why would the mic be on?  Why?  Why would it be on?  I'm so glad the listeners get to see it for themselves, because a lot of people think it's just a bit we do.  No, it's no bit.  It's reality.  All right, we'll try again.  Can we turn these in?  Yeah.  I just thought it would be funny if Gilbert hit hard times and became like a total degenerate, you know? 
[02:01:00]  That would be funny.  I don't know about that.  That's just, that's encouraging.  All right.  Anyone else have entries out there on the bleachers?  Jimmy's handing in his.  Anthony handed in his.  Mine can't be read on the air.  I don't know.  No, mine can't be read on the air.  Maybe with the button.  Maybe with the button?  Maybe with the button.  Sam, you got an entry from the listeners?  Yeah.  All right, what is his third panel? 
[02:01:30]  This young man's panel says, sort of, you'll be head bull prepper.  And then Gilbert says, in that case, I'll go back to Ted's filament factory.  Wow.  Hey, all right.  Nice.  Okay, here's one.  Let me read this.  This is just from somebody, Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  However, I'm prepared to offer you a position in sales. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  And then Dilbert says, you mean a job?  And Dogbert says, no, Obama president, nah.  We're giving your job to a...  Jesus.  Jesus.  Okay.  Wow.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  Here he goes.  He got it.  He got it.  He's cracking up.  That's the kind of loss we had here. 
[02:02:30]  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boy, look at everybody out there, just really thinking, and what's the matter?  You got nothing, don't you?  Look at you.  Nothing.  Here you go.  Danny, I'll try that one.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  That's never good.  Okay.  All right.  So, however, I am prepared to offer you a position in sales, and Dilbert says, you mean a job. 
[02:03:00]  And Dogbert says, yes, you can do Opie and Anthony's job once Anne gets them fired.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Any others?  We have one from Intern Paul.  Intern Paul?  All right, Sam, take it away.  Oh, wow.  Oh, boy.  However, I am prepared to offer you a position in sales. 
[02:03:30]  And then Dilbert says, you mean a job?  And then in the third box, Paul just wrote the word no.  Why is that funny?  There's something funny about it.  You know what?  Because I was still laughing.  It's a shitty setup for a joke.  Because if Dogbert's going to offer him a position in sales, why would Dilbert reply, you mean a job?  Yes.  That's my entry.  Dogbert says, yes, a position in sales. 
[02:04:00]  Dilbert says, thanks.  It's just as good as what this asshole is writing and getting in papers.  You got another one there, Sam?  Yeah, this is from Tom out here.  All right, one of the listeners.  Who, I am prepared to offer you a position in sales.  And then Dilbert says, you mean a job.  And then Dogbert doesn't say anything.  And then Dilbert says, sales?  What other kind of jobs we got? 
[02:04:30]  I guess in reference to the...  Yeah, the beer club show.  Right.  Right.  What is that?  What the fuck?  What is that?  That's someone's fucking phone.  UFO.  That's our copy machine making more Dilbert.  Oh, Dilbert.  Wow.  Well, can the intern that's holding that wireless mic point it away from the copy machine?  He probably put it right down on the copy machine.  That's wrong.  Okay, we have another one.  Yeah.  From Kevin.  He says, you mean a job? 
[02:05:00]  And then Dogbert says, yeah, selling I hate your guts by Jim Norton.  Oh!  I think it's more of a plug than anything.  And then one from Heather.  You mean a job?  And then Dogbert says, based on your choice of clothing, you've already lost all sense of self-respect.  I think sales is perfect, now blow me.  Which is more...  The now blow me kicker, I like.  That's good.  That's a good one.  Chokers.  We got another one being handed in. 
[02:05:30]  Thank God.  We got another one.  You mean a job?  No.  You are going on welfare and taking ants' money.  Oh, I don't like that.  I don't find it funny.  Does he have those blank ones?  Yeah, they're coming.  Oh, we got more blank ones.  Being passed out.  Good.  Mm.  Mm-hmm.  Give me a couple.  Give me a couple.  Hey, keep in mind, folks.  This is only today. 
[02:06:00]  We could do yesterday's.  We could do last.  Oh, fantastic.  Let's just focus on this one.  Are you sure?  Oh, thank you.  Let's just focus on this one.  Yeah.  Can't wait to read what the listeners come up with online.  Half of my panel is cut off.  I think I'll make it.  All right.  Intern Paul wasn't happy with his first entry.  Ah!  He has another entry.  Okay.  He says, you mean a job?  And then Dogbert says, only if you fuck me.  And then Dilbert says, I'll get the oven mitts.  Because he's a dog. 
[02:06:30]  That's good.  And the oven mitts.  But, yes.  But that would be the dog fucking Dilbert.  No.  Dilbert fucks the dog.  Yeah, but no.  The oven mitts are for the dog fucking Dilbert in the ass, because the oven mitts keep the  claws from digging into Dilbert's sides.  No, no.  The dog wants to get fucked.  But then the oven mitts don't make sense.  No, you don't understand.  No, I understand.  You don't seem to.  Dilbert is fucking the dog.  So, what are the oven mitts for? 
[02:07:00]  To fuck the dog with?  No.  Everyone knows the dog fucks the human.  You duct tape the oven mitts on the dog's front paws, because when he mounts you to fuck  you, his dewclaw will dig into your sides and leave scratches on your ribs.  We have a really good one from Executive Intern David.  Oh, all right.  Let David read it himself.  David's got to do it in his inimitable delivery.  Ladies and gentlemen, Executive Intern David making his way into the studio.  Have you met this guy yet, Otto? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, at the out of building.  Oh, that's right.  He was drinking the...  Okay.  Yeah.  Intern David.  Executive Intern David.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  Okay, this is...  I'll read it.  Dogvert says,  You survived the rigorous interview process.  There are no old news engineering.  Then he says,  However, I am prepared to offer you a position in sales.  And Dogvert says,  You mean a job?  And Dogvert says,  Yes, you will actually have to do work.  And Dilbert says,  Oh, man. 
[02:08:00]  Doesn't like work.  You could write for Dilbert, though.  Yes.  That would probably appear in the paper.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  Fool.  Here you go.  Fool.  Oh, thanks, Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul is having an appearance.  Uncle Paul making an appearance.  Yes.  Read Uncle Paul's name, Danny.  Oh, no.  Well, I don't really think that it's Dogvert and Dilbert having a conversation. 
[02:08:30]  It just kind of seems like a question that Uncle Paul is kind of wondering.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Thank you, Ken.  Cartoons is fun.  It just says...  You have to read the cartoon.  Okay, let me read the cartoon.  So we know what the first panel is.  And then Dogvert says,  However, I am prepared to offer you a position in sales.  And Dilbert asks, 
[02:09:00]  Do you mean a job?  And then I'm not quite sure who's saying this.  It's just kind of in the panel.  In bad handwriting, it just says,  You got any kids I can fuck?  Jesus.  And K-A-N is spelled K-A-N.  K-A-N.  I like cartoons.  And Uncle is also spelled with a K. 
[02:09:30]  Like cars for kids.  Sam, we got a couple more.  Yeah.  Heather has a follow-up.  You may remember Heather.  She's the one who wrote,  Based on your choice of clothing,  you've lost all self-respect.  I think sales is perfect.  Now blow me.  Yeah.  She's trying to get.  The follow-up.  Okay.  He says,  You mean a job?  And then the dog says,  I said blow me. 
[02:10:00]  It's kind of a follow-up.  Yeah.  It's kind of a sequel almost.  Dilbert 1.5.  We've got one from Kevin,  who Dilbert says,  You mean a job?  And then Dogbert says,  More like begging.  You're selling Voss tickets.  Oh, see.  Rich isn't even here to defend himself.  Wow.  That's so not right.  You got another one there, Sam? 
[02:10:30]  Yes.  This is a good one  because it's political.  Oh.  Okay.  Dilbert says,  You mean a job?  And then Dogbert says,  Yeah, a job.  Wait.  Bloomberg just cut that one, too.  There you go.  Hmm.  I get it.  Because that's the way  he's running the city.  Okay.  All right.  We have another entry.  Yes.  So, again,  Dogbert,  However, I'm prepared  to offer you a position in sales.  Dilbert asks,  You mean a job? 
[02:11:00]  And Dogbert replies,  Yes.  You can clean cum  out of my handlebar mustache.  Jesus.  Wow.  That was a nice little callback.  Wow.  Wow.  Sam, back to you.  We've got one from Keith.  Yeah.  And then Dilbert says,  You mean a job?  And then Dogbert says,  Yes, but you'll be selling Gap the movie. 
[02:11:30]  And then Dilbert says,  I would rather drive my wife to suicide.  Oh.  Wow.  That kind of happened.  A little Paulo bashing going on there.  Jesus.  And then our intern Charlie did one.  All right.  And then Dogbert says,  I mean, Dilbert says,  You mean a job?  And then Dogbert says,  No, a position in sales,  you cunt.  So,  that's the blow me approach.  Yeah, yeah.  Just something dirty. 
[02:12:00]  It'll always make you chuckle.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.  I think something is happening.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony on the virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  We have very good news for the live audience today.  What?  We're queer.  You picked the right day to come here.  We got a Dilbert update. 
[02:12:30]  Dilbert?  Yes.  Now,  oh,  Sam is here.  Sam just loves Dilbert.  Apparently,  when we last left Dilbert,  he had been fired from his job that he had been at forever.  He got fired,  and we were reading some other comics,  and we thought for a second that maybe Dogbert,  his pet,  was putting him through mock interviews to train him.  Yeah.  But I did a little back research.  Yeah.  And what had happened was,  as you'll see illustrated in the top strip that I handed out to everyone. 
[02:13:00]  Oh,  thank you.  The stock in the company that Dilbert was working for,  it fell to just a penny a share.  So Dogbert was able to purchase 51% of the company.  Wait,  wait,  Dogbert owns the company?  Yeah.  That's preposterous.  Why wouldn't he just hire him then?  Well,  that's what he was putting through all the rigorous tests.  It was a real interview.  That's silly.  A dog owns the company.  So Dogbert works for satellite radio? 
[02:13:30]  No,  I don't think I'm specific to that.  I want to know,  now why is Tumor Body standing on the desk?  That's Dogbert.  He's the boss.  That's Dogbert.  Okay.  Dogbert's letting Dilbert's old boss know,  your stock fell to a penny a share.  So I bought 51% of the company.  Uh-oh.  I'll double my investment just by firing you.  And then he says to the boss,  thanks for not being totally worthless.  And the guy goes,  you're welcome.  Wow,  that's a terrific one right there. 
[02:14:00]  These are the things that keep the laughs coming.  That one was brilliant.  Oh,  yeah.  So worth being in thousands of newspapers.  How the fuck are they not putting,  papers wonder why they're going under?  Save yourself the fucking page cost  and don't print this one.  What is the reaction after you read this?  It's pretty funny.  It's the same reaction you have  where you look down and you see a gum wrapper.  There's a non-reaction to it.  What?  Does even the drawings suck?  But you also have to know what's coming next. 
[02:14:30]  You know what I mean?  What's this leading to?  Because now we're looking at Dilbert  going to all types of different work areas  and seeing what his experiences are there.  So he's up in his game, obviously.  Right.  Yeah.  So what do we got now, Sam?  Dilbert in sales?  Right.  Yeah.  Next, Dilbert would start working in sales.  And so this guy is talking to him  and walking him through the office  and saying,  we had to be more creative  because of the soft economy.  Can I stop you there, Sam?  Sure.  A little observation.  What do you call Dilbert?  Oh, cigar body?  Cigar body. 
[02:15:00]  Cigar body and tumor body is dog person.  Yes.  Cigar body, also known as AKA.  He's a little.  Well, it's always been that way, right?  Why?  Why is that?  He's disheveled, you know?  Yeah, but why wouldn't the boss go,  look, fix your fucking tire.  I think it's a subliminal boner.  Oh, my goodness.  It sort of looks like he's trying to suck his own dick.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Either that or it's a fishing hook,  and apparently there's a pier,  and someone says,  I'm going to fish for an unfunny cigar body cartoon,  and they caught one.  Whoever draws this should get fucking finger cancer. 
[02:15:30]  How great would that be  if their fingertips had to be amputated  due to fucking finger tumors  that look like dog birds?  But he insists on continuing,  so now he does the cartoon with his mouth.  Yes, he has to put them out.  Now, cigar body looks really awful.  Looks more realistic.  Dilburn Sales,  we had to be more creative  because of the soft economy.  All right, continue there, Sam.  Right, and so now this new guy  who's showing them around says,  now we kill our customers  and replace them with body doubles  who place big orders.  And then in the next frame,  there's some, I guess, woman 
[02:16:00]  who says,  who's the handsome new sales guy?  And then the boss says,  he's you in about 10 minutes,  referring to Dilbert, of course.  And then she says,  what do you mean?  And he says,  well, he's going to have his cock cut off  and be made into a woman.  So we'll have two lungs  with vaginas running around this office.  No.  That was the end of the cartoon?  What does that mean?  I think it's,  maybe it's a commentary  on the high turnover rate going on  in a lot of companies. 
[02:16:30]  So Dilbert is now going to be,  I don't get it.  Dilbert, they're firing the bitch.  Here's what happened.  They hired Dilbert  and she has been seen  as an albatross in the company.  Yes.  Because her giant vagina  has been swallowing up desks  and typewriters  and computer monitors.  Her name is old big pussy Bertha  and they have to get rid  of that black hole.  And she's a flatso.  Anyone else notice  that the big fat broad  doesn't have that?  She's the worst.  And now I'm looking  at the next line of cartoons,  the three panels, 
[02:17:00]  and there's a little shit nugget  on the desk.  That's not a shit nugget.  There's a tiny little shit nugget.  Yeah, who's the shit nugget, Sam?  You're way off.  That's Catbert.  What is it?  Everybody have to be Bert.  It's just one of the cute things.  It's like ongoing.  You enjoy this?  It's funny.  This comic?  It's funny.  You like the Catbert?  Who do you like best?  Cigar Body, Dogbert, or Catbert?  Well...  Or Nugget.  Or Shit Nugget.  Cigar Body, Shit Nugget,  and Tumor Body.  Right.  Which one do you like the best?  Well, of course, you know, 
[02:17:30]  Cigar Body...  Well, Dilbert.  We'll call him Dilbert.  No, well, no.  Cigar Body.  Cigar Body.  Okay, well, he's my favorite  because he's the classic,  but every now and then  I get excited  because a Catbert appearance  is not as common  as, say, a dog bird.  That's not his name.  I mean, shit lump.  The top of Dilbert's head  looks like an unclipped cock.  Like you're waiting for a head  to come sliding out of it.  Jesus.  Well, this comic is called  Catbert, Evil Director  of Human Resources.  Oh!  Yeah, it's funny.  Dogbert appointed Catbert  to be head of Human Resources? 
[02:18:00]  That's crazy.  Why would a dog appoint a cat?  Yep.  Known enemies.  Yeah, they're too busy  licking their own assholes.  Yeah.  When do they have time  to do all this?  Exactly.  You'd be able to pilfer  from the company,  not show up for work  and still get paid  because a cat and a dog  are in charge of things.  Yes, your boss is  burying his own shit  in a box in the corner.  And then your other boss  is licking his balls  under a table.  So the cat...  Catbert.  No, what is it?  The shit turd?  Shit nugget.  Shit nugget.  Shit nugget is now 
[02:18:30]  the Human Resources Lady.  Evil Director of Human Resources.  All right, let's go.  And he says,  your boss says  you refuse to do your job.  And then Dilbert says,  he told me to kill a customer.  Assume her identity  and place a huge order  with our company.  And then Catbert says,  I'll transfer you  to the collections department  until you're willing to kill.  So that's the end  of that day's comic.  That's how it ended?  Yes. 
[02:19:00]  They always leave him laughing.  Right, until tomorrow.  And look,  we have a live audience today.  Not one...  Not even a chuckle.  Not even a smirk.  Nothing.  But this continues  to take up space  in our newspapers.  It's not fucking funny.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul in Virginia.  Paul.  Hey, Sam,  don't forget about Ratbert.  There's a Ratbert, too?  We haven't met Ratbert yet.  There's a rat.  Oh, yeah.  You guys were asking  about Dilbert's necktie.  Yeah.  And they made some 
[02:19:30]  lame joke about that  in a comic  that Dogbert said,  the reason your tie  stands up  is because it's trying  to get away from you  because you're such a loser.  Oh, that's funny.  That's kind of fun.  Poor Dilbert.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  When your own dog  is insulting your fishhook tie,  you can't win  for losing this guy.  Is this a whole week  of comics you brought us today?  Yeah, you wanted the update.  That's terrific.  Thank you.  We haven't done it in a week.  Now the next one is?  Dilbert is now working  in collections  where Catbert assigned him to.  Sure, okay. 
[02:20:00]  Right.  Because he didn't want  to kill a customer.  Right.  Shit nugget.  I'm sorry.  Shit nugget.  So Dilbert is...  Cigar body.  Cigar body is on the phone.  in a cubicle.  And he says,  please listen  while I read  this threatening script.  Which I'm sure  he's not supposed  to say threatening script.  I have hidden  poisonous spiders  in your home.  If you pay us now  by credit card,  I will give you  the antidote.  And then he says,  okay, fine.  That's the caller  saying, okay, fine. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  But if you feel  a tickle on your leg,  give me a call.  So...  This cartoon  fucking sucks!  It just gets you angry.  It's so bad.  These guys are  fucking terrible.  It's horrifically bad.  It makes me angry.  It is.  It makes you mad.  Once again,  a live studio audience,  they're actually  reading along.  Nothing.  Not a kafal.  The Polish beheading  a bigger laugh  when we fucking  read the transcript 
[02:21:00]  of that.  But I mean,  with all the bad news  going on in the papers,  there is something  to be said  to have some funnies.  You know what I mean?  We have one more  which will bring us up  to date.  This is today's.  Thank God.  This is today's?  Yes.  All right.  So where are we at?  Whoa, Dillbert...  Cigar Body.  I'm sorry.  Cigar Body is still  in collections.  Yeah.  And he's listening  on the phone now.  This one has  his roommate,  Jigbert.  Jesus.  What?  Apparently,  this guy's collecting  a bunch of Z's  from his readers.  Fucking stinks. 
[02:21:30]  Well,  the caller calls  and says,  my wife hates me  and I live between  an archery range  and a nest  of rabid badgers.  And then Dillbert says,  is that a reason  for not paying  your bills?  And then,  uh,  the guy says,  I'm just saying...  You mother's cunt.  That's not what  the guy says.  No,  the guy says,  I'm just saying  you called  at a bad time.  Now,  before,  I know,  just saying it  is not funny,  but there is 
[02:22:00]  an arrow  in his chest,  three rabid badgers  are biting him,  and a frying pan  in his head  from his wife.  Oh,  my God.  So it's kind of a visual.  He can't even draw  a badger,  right?  No.  Well,  they're rabid.  No.  They look like  three fucking,  three fat man  neck skin tags.  Yeah,  it's not even,  this is,  he's horrible.  Yeah,  this guy sucks.  He's not funny  and he's a terrible artist.  I just assumed  if he was in the paper  he had to be good,  so I'm like,  this Dilbert guy  must be terrific. 
[02:22:30]  Well,  I mean,  he stays shit  and thinks it's funny.  This guy makes  fucking Beatle Bailey  look like Woody Allen  in short stories.  Like Woody Allen's  moose pit?  Correct.  If everyone thinks  they can do better,  I mean.  Sam,  you got,  what do we got now?  Well,  would you want me  to read the original?  Fuck.  I printed out  another comic  that maybe everybody  could fill in  the blank box.  If you want me  to read the original  or you guys  could just read  the first two boxes.  Yeah,  don't read the original.  Wait,  we're playing our own?  That way,  yeah,  and the whole audience 
[02:23:00]  can play too.  Oh,  I thought he just did this  on a regular basis.  That was just one and done?  Where you make up  your own ending?  No,  we can make up  our own ending  for a new one.  All right.  But there is a real ending  is what you're saying.  Yes,  there is a real ending.  So we have to try  to do better  than the ending.  Yeah.  All right,  go ahead.  It's the job interview.  Go ahead there.  Right,  well,  the job interview,  so she's there  giving him the interview  and she says,  I detect the flop sweat  of desperation  and Dilbert is sweating.  With his stupid tie  sticking straight up  in the air. 
[02:23:30]  Lady has a boner.  He doesn't have  a tie clip.  No.  And then she says,  I base my hiring decisions  on who would make  a good mate  and I would never want  to give life  to your sweaty baby.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Give me a pen.  Oh, I need a pen.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, my.  And is the audience  attempting to fill  in the third panel there, Sam?  Yeah, I mean,  we gave them early,  so the audience  already has some.  Do you want to start  with some of those?  Yeah.  As Jimmy and Ant  write away. 
[02:24:00]  Well,  Jonas  says,  after she says,  I would never want  to give life  to your sweaty baby,  Jonas says,  here's cab fare  to Ted's abortion emporium.  Cut neck.  Cut neck.  I figured that would happen.  Wow.  All right.  The audience  handed in their  third panel 
[02:24:30]  going through  Same theme.  Jimmy, you got one?  Sam reading yours?  Same theme.  Well, this one's  worded better, I think.  She says,  I wouldn't,  and I would never want  to give life  to your sweaty baby.  Yeah.  And she says,  you wouldn't have  to worry,  I'd abort it  with my fish  tie.  two abortion jokes  in a row.  In a row.  Well,  that's why that one  didn't go.  Ah, okay.  Can I have some  more blank ones? 
[02:25:00]  Go ahead, Sam.  Another one from Jonas.  Yeah.  Jonas,  very motivated today.  Yes.  I would never want  to give life  to your sweaty baby.  And then Dilbert responds,  that's why I'm  throwing you down  the steps,  clit nose.  She does that  with clit nose.  All right.  This one,  from an unnamed  listener.  Okay.  I would never want  to give life  to your sweaty baby.  And then Dilbert says,  something smells  putrid  and it ain't my sweat. 
[02:25:30]  She says,  excuse me.  And he says,  it smells like  your shallow grave,  cunt.  All right,  here's one.  I got audience  participation as  Anthony hands his in.  Scott S.  from Quakertown,  right?  So Dilbert says,  okay,  I'll just fuck you  in the ass then.  That's a good one.  This one from Anthony.  Can you re-read  the entire part 
[02:26:00]  to just get everyone  back on the same page  and then read  Anthony's third panel.  It's a job interview.  Yes.  The lady interviewing  Dilbert says,  I detect the flop sweat  of desperation.  And then she says,  I base my hiring decisions  on who would make  a good mate  and I would never  want to give life  to your sweaty baby.  And then Dilbert responds,  I'd kick you  in the cunt anyway  till your spawn  splats on the floor  like a jar  of marachino cherries.  Jesus. 
[02:26:30]  See,  because,  you know,  she insulted him  and he told her  a thing or two.  About a thing or two.  Yes.  Well,  Evan,  one of the listeners,  says,  you know,  she says,  and I would never  want to give life  to your sweaty baby.  And Dilbert responds,  that doesn't make  very much sense.  So,  that's Evan's take  on the comic.  He could write  for this comic.  Yes. 
[02:27:00]  Let's see,  another good one.  This one is written  in caps,  so I'll buy that.  It's yelling.  It's yelling.  Will says,  I would never want  to give life  to your sweaty baby.  And Dilbert responds,  well,  shut your cock,  sucker.  You shall feel  my balls  upon your chin  after a prompt  bra bombing.  Linga longa.  There's no reason  for that type of language.  No. 
[02:27:30]  That's a little wordy for that.  That one was  a little wordy,  Sam.  Yes.  You got one?  Who's this from?  This is from Jim.  As in Jim Norton?  Jim Norton?  Some listener  named Jim,  I guess.  Someone named Jim.  You have to read  the whole cartoon,  of course,  because the cartoon's funny.  Yes.  Right,  from the beginning.  She says,  I detect the flop  sweat of desperation.  Then she says,  I base my hiring  decisions on who  would make a good mate,  and I would never  want to give life  to your sweaty baby.  And then Dilbert responds,  you silly goose, 
[02:28:00]  babies only sweat  when you fuck them.  Holy shit.  Now that's  a funny Dilbert.  It sure is.  Oh my god.  Looks like  intern Paul  is going for one.  See if intern Paul  can follow Jim.  She says, 
[02:28:30]  I would never want  to give life  to your sweaty baby.  Dilbert says,  take it, bitch.  Which is simple.  I might have one.  Short and to the point.  Oh.  Alright.  So,  interview lady says,  I would never want  to give life  to your sweaty baby.  And Dilbert says,  that's not sweat,  it's lake water.  That's funny.  Bravo.  Shit,  it's hard.  As you guys 
[02:29:00]  are writing,  I could give you  the one that  I didn't read.  Which now,  I'll read.  Now that I got  a little confidence,  throw it out there.  I would never want  to give life  to your sweaty baby.  And Dilbert replies,  well,  from the looks of you,  you'll probably  miscarry anyway.  Look,  you got a solid  response from that one.  Sam,  you got another one  over there  not worth reading?  Here's one  from Scott.  maybe our intern Scott 
[02:29:30]  or maybe a listener  named Scott.  All right.  I would never  want to give life  to your sweaty baby.  And then Dilbert says,  no problem,  then let me blow it  on your head  like a broken beehive.  That's one.  This one is coming  from Jim.  A listener  named Jim.  Listen.  who she says,  I would never want  to give life  to your sweaty baby.  And then Dilbert says,  then how about  I eat Mexican  and fill your pussy 
[02:30:00]  full of shit?  I never thought  I'd see space docking  come to a Dilbert strip.  Sam,  in this bit,  I don't think we  actually talked to you  as far as,  do you cry  watching TV shows  or movies?  I haven't shed a tear  since I was in, 
[02:30:30]  I don't know,  I was probably 15 or 16  the last time I cried.  Really?  I'm not going to do  that bullshit.  You didn't cry  when Ric Flair retired?  Nope.  Well,  this was a segment  about are there TV shows  that make you cry  and I volunteered  some information  or maybe was forced  into it,  I don't know,  it's one of the two.  The TV show  that makes E-Rock cry  is looking up  E-Rock on YouTube.  That's not a TV show.  Oh, sorry.  That's what you do.  Every day.  I don't cry.  I catch you.  I laugh.  Somebody works  on Foundry Cams,  you were Googling me  and looking me up  on YouTube.  I'm a fan.  Yeah, 
[02:31:00]  so there was an episode  of Futurama  that I was explaining  made me upset.  They couldn't understand why,  so we explore that.  Eric Cries During Cartoons  is kind of the base  of this whole routine.  One cartoon.  An episode of a cartoon.  One episode of one cartoon  is what you happen  to be crying at  at that point.  It's the worst  of the Opie and Anthony show.  My asshole is it.  This is the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  To this.  Dummy.  Dummy.  This is the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  That was weird.  Big Bang.  Oh, my brother. 
[02:31:30]  I was going to say  that's weird  because my brother  called and said  you've got to watch  Big Bang.  It was on TV  last night.  It rocks.  He says it's  a really good show.  You watch Big Bang?  No.  Is it a sitcom, though?  I haven't seen it,  but I have heard  good things about that show.  A lot of people  talking about Big Bang.  You watch Big Bang?  Yeah.  What's Big Bang  all about, E-Rock?  Turn us on  to something new.  Big Bang  are these physicists.  That's what's made  when E-Rock  gets out of bed.  See?  I get it.  See?  You put your feet  on the floor.  These physicists 
[02:32:00]  out in California  that live together  and a hot chick  who comes from  the Midwest  moves in right next door  to them.  So they're all awkward  dealing with this hot girl.  Freeze Company?  They do all this  kind of geeky stuff.  They're playing rock band  and online gaming  and things like that.  Oh, good.  So they try to take  popular culture  and throw it  into the show like that.  It's a show about nerds.  You really sold the show.  I can't wait to watch it.  I'm going to DVR it.  God, it makes it sound  so fucking bad.  Yeah.  I'm just like...  You like it?  I love it. 
[02:32:30]  Why do you like it?  It's just so ridiculous  that you enjoy watching it.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  All right.  And it's on right before  How I Met Your Mother, too.  You watch that?  Yeah.  That's supposed to be  really good.  Is it?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  I don't watch  any fucking sitcom.  Because a lot of people  say it's a really good sitcom.  that come on TV right now, right?  Did it make you cry, Eric?  No.  What shows do make you cry?  Ooh, that's a good question.  Opie and Anthony shows.  Do you ever watch TV  and it makes you cry  because something happened  that was so emotional? 
[02:33:00]  That's stupid,  extreme home makeover.  Oh, yeah.  I know we're on a fez  we're talking about yesterday.  I know where you're going with this.  But that fucking show will...  All of a sudden,  you'll see a tear fly  out of your eyes  going,  What the fuck?  I would never even get a fucking...  Have you watched the show, though?  Yes.  Yes.  You don't have a heart.  I have one.  I have one.  In that chest of yours.  I do.  I would never get fucking worked up  over that fucking show.  Not that show.  They're down on their luck.  The kid has some rare disease.  Oh, it's always something. 
[02:33:30]  Allergic to fucking oxygen.  No, the best one was the...  What was it?  The body temperature.  Yeah, the body temperature.  Kid's got to be kept  at a fucking constant certain degree.  So the rest of the family  has to freeze their asses off.  They walk around the house  with winter coats on.  They put meat locker fucking compresses in  instead of air conditioners.  Oh, my God.  What were you getting at with E-Rock  as far as the crying goes?  Because I know something's going on there.  Somebody, you know,  everybody has their own thing.  But Eric has his own emotional show.  Yeah, there's a...  It's not the show. 
[02:34:00]  It was an episode.  An episode?  Of what?  A show called Futurama.  Futurama.  There's no way  you could get teary-eyed  at Futurama  unless they said  they were taking it off the air.  Unless they showed you yours.  There's one episode you can.  The main character,  his name is Fry,  tries to find out  about the history of his dog.  Fry was sent to the future,  so he's trying to look back  into history  to see what happened to his dog.  And they tell you the story 
[02:34:30]  about him and his dog,  and towards the end,  it gets a little upsetting.  What happens?  Don't worry,  we're not going to watch it.  Yeah, you don't have to  worry about ruining the ending.  Well, the dog dies,  but how'd he die?  Of course it does.  I'm waiting for him to come home.  Oh, that's so sad  because he went into the future,  he couldn't get back,  and then he's just waiting there.  Yeah.  Did he turn into a skeleton  just kind of sitting there?  If you watch it,  it's sad.  Do you have a dog?  Do you have a dog?  I had many dogs.  Fucking cartoon.  Yeah.  Made you cry. 
[02:35:00]  You got fucking...  You can't cry.  Yeah, what...  Not a cartoon.  Watch it.  Unless it's Bambi.  Bambi made you cry.  Nah, I didn't even give a shit about that.  So what dog did that remind you of of yours?  I'm sure one of your pets died  that it reminded you of.  No, it didn't remind me of any specific pet,  but just the fact that the dog  was just waiting there at the end  as years went by,  waiting for him to come home,  and then it just ends with the dog dying.  Someone is actually sticking up for you, Rock.  You better make him a friend.  Probably the creator of the cartoon. 
[02:35:30]  Make this a friend.  He's got to be a friend on Facebook.  Sean in Georgia.  Sean.  I hate to do this,  but I absolutely have to support E-Rock  on this episode.  It is incredibly sad.  No one could support E-Rock.  Exactly.  I still don't know why.  We're on a metal floor.  Why was it sad?  I still don't know why.  Because at the very end...  It's just the whole fact that  if you ever had a dog  you're really attached to,  you understand that he wanted  to get his dog back,  but he figures that the dog  had just forgot about him  because he had been gone for so long. 
[02:36:00]  But it's a cartoon.  It shows the dog  just waiting in the same spot  he waited for him every day.  It's the story,  not the...  But it's a cartoon.  It takes you out of it.  No, it's out of it.  It's the story.  If you pay attention to the story,  not to the fact that it's drawings,  it actually gets emotional at the end of it.  So wait,  so you're saying that  they pan out,  they show those fucking  unused oven mitts now  on the...  that waist-high peanut butter  at the table.  It never fails.  Never. 
[02:36:30]  Every fucking time.  I'm with a dog.  Coke logic.  Good evening.  Good evening.  You're with E-Rock on this?  I absolutely am.  As soon as you said Futurama,  I knew exactly what episode  he was going to bring up.  When they fucking...  I think it's the fucking...  The music that they play  at the...  While they're showing the dog  of the passage of time  of him waiting forever.  It's like,  if it takes forever,  I will wait.  I'm sure Danny's looking.  Are you searching? 
[02:37:00]  Oh, my God.  Danny's good at this.  Could you give me a copy?  I'm going to let...  Yeah.  I'm going to watch it  with an open mind  and see what it does.  It's a good show.  It's a very good show.  But that one episode  was really sad.  Dude, they're coming  on...  Thanks, Coke logic.  We got to go to  Anthony in Florida.  They're coming out  of the woodwork.  They're all crying over here.  Anthony.  I actually never saw  the episode,  but just thinking about it  got me a little teary-eyed  because...  What's wrong with everybody?  I'm gay,  which I'm not,  but Jesus. 
[02:37:30]  You know what it is?  A dog will never lie to you.  What?  They'll never...  Sure, well,  it'll eat its own shit  and lick your face.  Yeah, that's a life.  That's me.  They'll also never  tell you the truth.  They'll also never tell you  if someone was fucking  your girl while you were out.  Fuck your dog.  Fuck your dog.  That dumb animal  will lick the hand  of someone who just  fingered your girl's ass box.  Exactly.  Fucking disloyal monsters.  Dog will never lie to you.  He'll climb on your pillow  with shit toes.  Oh, shit toes. 
[02:38:00]  Fuck your dog.  I'm rooting for the car.  Oh, he'll fucking lay  on his fucking...  belly on your bed  or couch  with that white cheesy shit  coming out of his dick hole.  Right after someone else  fucked your chick  and then you'll come home  and will he go like...  Will he nod towards your pussy?  No, he'll lick your face.  Is this the end of the episode?  E-Rock?  All right.  Yeah, you're getting to it.  Yeah.  Where's the sound?  Well, let's get the sound out.  We got some sound?  I want to hear the song.  This is what made E-Rock cry.  Okay. 
[02:38:30]  All right.  Wait, explain what's going on here.  Back up a little bit.  E-Rock, set this up.  All right.  Futurama.  He found...  Hold on.  Just pause that for a second.  He had...  If I'm remembering right,  he found the remains of his dog  and he realized  that his dog was waiting for him  the whole time,  that the dog just abandoned him.  Yeah.  So then it cuts back to the past.  Now it shows you  what the dog actually did  when Fry left for the future.  So the dog is sitting there  in front of the pizza place.  Yeah.  For how long?  And time is going. 
[02:39:00]  Well, you'll see.  Time is going...  Because it keeps going, you know.  All right, let's see.  Year 2000, 2001,  it keeps, like, going forward.  Is it like that fucking movie AI  that freaked the shit out of me?  I don't know.  That kid was underwater  for a long time.  Thousands of years.  That was creepy shit.  That'll happen.  All right, go.  I will wait for you.  Dog just sitting outside  the pizza joint.  People walking by.  There's a song.  I will wait for you. 
[02:39:30]  Snow.  Back to spring.  Back to summer.  Fall.  Winter.  Spring.  Dog's getting all over.  Pizza joint's changing.  I will wait for you. 
[02:40:00]  Pizza joint's getting real old.  Pizza joint's now closed.  I will wait for you.  Oh, they cut it off.  They should have.  Thank God.  Who gives a shit?  What do you mean they fucking sucked?  What do you mean they cut it off?  That dumb dog just sitting there?  Yeah.  Asshole.  When you watch the whole story  and then you watch to the very end,  they cut it off.  The dog lays down  and then it just sits there  and then the dog dies.  Why did he come back for the dog?  It's not right.  It's not right.  No.  No.  Get that fucking Tippi Tom in front of me. 
[02:40:30]  Tippi Tom watching Sophie's Choice  is one of the best clips ever, ever.  Dude, what the?  Everyone's backing up.  What's wrong?  We got a bunch of faggots watching this show.  Are we all syncing up  and having our periods at the same time?  I just watched it, ladies.  It's not sad.  No.  It's a dumb dog.  You hate the dog.  They're being stupid.  Let's see if these guys can turn us around.  Tom and Philly.  Tom.  Turn us around.  Hey, guys.  E-Rock, I'm right there with you.  I watched that episode on the DVD  when it came out years ago  and I was blubbering.  Yes.  Oh. 
[02:41:00]  E-Rock's blubbering, too.  The third Lord of the Rings movie.  Huh?  I also cried at the end  of the third Lord of the Rings movie.  Did you?  Yeah, when they're all gay  jumping up and down on the bed.  Did you cry when you see the...  How come Anthony cried  when Hitler killed his dog?  I see.  It's a dog thing.  When Goldie gets the old tablet there.  So you can understand crying over a dog.  Do you really think that's why Anthony was crying?  Yeah.  Think of what year it was  and what happened shortly after. 
[02:41:30]  Ken, what's going on?  Playing that fucking music got me going.  There I was downstairs one time  watching TV,  having sex with my girlfriend.  The episode turned on  had to stop right there.  You watch the episode, man,  and if you like dogs,  it gets to you.  I like dogs.  I didn't feel anything watching that.  You just watched the...  The ending cut off,  but you just watched a tiny clip.  I get it, though.  The dog is waiting for his owner to return  and the owner never returns.  Watch the whole thing.  The dog dies, obviously.  Yeah.  So?  It's a cartoon. 
[02:42:00]  Why wouldn't the pizza guy go,  what the fuck's this animal  in front of my place  for six years for?  Right.  And get rid of it.  Let's go to Brian and Danbury.  Brian.  Dee-dee-doo-doo-doo.  The music, again,  it got me to cry.  The first time I saw that,  I sobbed uncontrollably,  and my girlfriend just hated me for it.  As she should have.  I'd like to kick you in the cunt  right now for listening.  Exactly.  No, when you see the beginning  and the dog,  his name is Seymour,  he's just so friendly  and they're feeding each other pizza  and he was making the sauce  and it was just too much. 
[02:42:30]  When he lays down at the end,  when it's raining,  it was too much.  Look, that dog's a bag of shit  and he should have got hit  by a truck sooner.  Fucking idiot he is.  Travis?  I think that that story  might be based on a true story.  I hope it's sooner or later  based on your ass.  Why is everyone getting angry?  A fantastic animal.  There was this Japanese dog.  Yeah.  Do you know this story?  He would go to the...  A Japanese dog?  What story is there?  He had slanted eyes  and fucking drove his vehicle 
[02:43:00]  into other dog vehicles?  What is there to know?  I'm trying to understand this.  Okay, let me tell you a story.  Did you cry too?  No, no, no.  I've never seen this episode.  He would go to the train station  with his owner every day  and say goodbye to his owner  and then at five o'clock  or whatever time  he would come home,  the dog would go  to the train station  and greet his owner.  One day the owner died  and the dog went  to the train station  to see his owner 
[02:43:30]  and the owner never showed up.  Yeah.  I'm just watching Danny  waft his fart  into Travis' face  as he's trying to tell the story.  He's cupping it  and throwing it at him.  And every day  for the next...  Until he died  he went back  to that train station  to meet his owner  who never came back.  How long was that?  He died.  He was 11 years old.  How long was he doing that?  I'm not sure  but he did it  until he died.  He would go back every day. 
[02:44:00]  And this is a real story.  Yes, it's a real story.  Absolutely true story.  Where would the dog go  before then?  After he realized  that fucking Sato  was not getting off the train  because a tree fell on him  and instead of karate-ing  the tree off Mr. Miyagi  teabagged him  and then strangled him  to save the village.  You know what wasn't sad  about that whole thing?  Right off the bat  I noticed something there.  When he left him  he was a new little puppy.  Right.  So how fucking attached  could he have been to him? 
[02:44:30]  He was a puppy.  He didn't know any better.  He didn't know  he was a puppy.  It's not like he was with him  for years and years.  He just got the fucking  little thing.  I'm with you  but look at these phones.  Oh, they're all gay.  And no one wants  to defend Iraq ever.  Alex, Cleveland.  Hello, Alex.  Hello, Alex.  Iraq is totally butchering  the story of this episode here.  What happens is  Fry finds the fossilized  remains of this dog  in the future, right?  And they find out  and he's like debating  on whether or not  he wants to bring him 
[02:45:00]  back to life  through whatever  wacky contraption  that the professor has, right?  But they find out  that when the dog died  he was like 11  or 12 years old  or whatever  and Fry's like,  oh, well,  that means after I left  when he was really young  he must have lived  like a full happy life, right?  And that's when they cut  to the ending credits  and like all the seasons  going by  and you find out  the dog didn't live  a happy life  and it was waiting  for him the entire time.  That's a stupid dog.  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  Slow down,  so I'm getting  all choked up.  I'm still...  God, could I give a shit  about this fucking cartoon dog?  I'm amazed.  Michael in Cincinnati.  Michael.  Yeah, I gotta stick  with Iraq.  The episode's very sad.  It's been a couple times.  It gets me every time.  Go ahead, call me faggot.  Faggot.  Faggot.  I tried during sad movies  but this one  just wasn't that sad.  No.  I know we're  spending way too much  time on this  but I'm just amazed  that there's people  out there  that are completely  agreeing with Iraq.  Someone they don't  want to agree with.  Look, the phones 
[02:46:00]  are just jammed  with people going  yeah, it made me cry too.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul the intern.  Where's he calling from?  Yo, you guys know me?  I'm a big kind of  burly-ish looking dude.  That fucking episode  makes me tear up  like a little bitch  every single time I do.  You're the one  with the beard?  Yeah, I'm the one  with the long hair beard.  You're crying too?  Why?  I don't know.  I'm a faggot I guess.  But I mean  it's just the saddest thing  I've ever seen.  Saddest thing 
[02:46:30]  he's ever seen.  It's true.  Holocaust footage  anything.  It's just, you know.  Oh, that's just  good clean fun.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  Kyle hasn't seen  a collection  of his own work here.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  We got Ray  from the Philly crew.  This makes you cry?  Sorry, Ope.  That I don't call  I'm exactly right, man.  When the seasons go by  you can't help it, man.  You just realize  how long he was  sitting there for.  It's sad. 
[02:47:00]  It's a great episode, though.  Are you crying  because the dog  is so stupid  that you just don't  find somewhere else  to fucking hang out?  You can't help it, man.  I've had dogs  with my old wife  and I hit you.  Even Ray from the Philly crew.  You're killing me.  You're one of the  tougher guys down there.  I know, Ray.  Oh, man.  Not when that comes on.  Ray's a tough dude, man.  Tough fucking dude.  Sorry.  And he's crying  over this cartoon.  All right, Ray.  Say hi to Ray  and Ray Ray  and all the other  Ray's down there.  All right.  You got to go.  Oh, you doesn't 
[02:47:30]  have to call him Ray.  You can call me  You can call me  Crybaby.  You can call me  Faggot.  You can call me  You can call me  Woman,  but she doesn't  have to call me Ray.  They love the name  Ray in that family.  They love it.  All right, let's go  to Ryan in Connecticut.  Ryan.  Yeah, you got to  Anthony, you got to  understand here.  If it was Doc Brown  going back from the  future to save  Einstein,  you'd completely  understand.  I wouldn't care 
[02:48:00]  if Einstein  was killed.  Did you ever care  about a pet, Anthony?  And cry over  the loss of a pet?  A little Smokey.  Yeah, you tell  the Smokey story.  That's a good one.  But so much time  went by between  the time that  Smokey disappeared  till the time I  found out Smokey  died that I had  already run the  emotional gamut.  But when you found  Smokey with the maggots?  No, I didn't cry.  I just thought it was  creepy and it was  like, eww, eww.  Gave you nightmares?  Yeah, yeah, it was  nightmarish.  That moment when  Einstein was gone  and Marty was like,  but Doc, what about 
[02:48:30]  Einstein?  And Doc had to go  back and save him.  It's the same thing.  No, not the same  thing because I  wouldn't care if  Einstein came back  a skeleton in the  DeLorean.  I'll tell you why that  Futurama episode is not  sad.  Because that is just  one potential timeline.  Let's say Fry goes  back in time.  But Fry doesn't have  a DeLorean.  He can't go back in time.  Well, I'm saying they  live in the year 3000.  I'm sure they could  arrange something.  Yes.  I mean, have you ever  even seen that professor  on that show?  He could do amazing  things with his work.  He's fantastic. 
[02:49:00]  Okay, so maybe Fry  somehow travels back  in time, picks up the  dog right in front of  Panucci's, and then  they have this new  timeline, which exists,  where the dog doesn't  wait around for Fry and  die.  So you're using  Back to the Future  rules and not Lost  rules.  I guess.  I haven't watched  Lost, so I don't  know.  Well, Lost says that  timeline runs like a  river.  You can go forward  and backwards, but you  cannot branch off.  Oh, shit.  So it's a straight  street without side  streets.  So that's the Lost 
[02:49:30]  version.  The Back to the Future  version is, if you  change something, at  that change point, you  then will shoot off into  a different thing, which  gives you things like  Biff Co and Biff's  Casino and the  wonderful...  If he never would  have been the richest  man in the world, the  dog never would have  died.  Well, you know who we  should ask about this,  because he's probably  the most schooled person  on the subject, is  Dr. Michio Kaku.  Yes.  I'm sure he would be  thrilled to answer our  Futurama and Back to the  Future questions.  Of course.  Why don't we get him on  the phone?  That would be brilliant.  Well, maybe if Jimmy 
[02:50:00]  jabs him in the side of  the elevator and says,  come on the show again.  I want to apologize to  Eroch, because he's  sitting there looking all  confident and happy that  people are on his side.  I want to apologize ahead  of time, because this is  going to take a nasty  turn right now.  Futur!  Yo, boys, what's up?  Hey, everybody's called to  agree with Eroch.  I've got to say, I do not  agree with Eroch, and he is  fat.  Oh!  Oh, wow.  We concur.  Matt on Long Island.  Here they come.  Matt.  Does the opening to the  Flintstones make Eroch cry,  because those ribs aren't  available anymore? 
[02:50:30]  Oh, Eroch has a moment.  And cries at the opening of  the Jetsons when George gives  all his money to Jane.  Yeah.  Let's go to Lou.  Lou.  In Jersey.  Okay, Lou.  What?  Lou.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  You guys don't get it, man.  You have dogs.  I could watch a kid die in a  movie, and it won't bother me,  but kill a dog in a movie, 
[02:51:00]  and that's the worst thing you  could ever watch.  Way to sell it.  Yeah, well.  Yeah, people get hung up on  their fucking dogs.  Yeah.  Of course you do.  Let me tell you a story, a  little sad dog story.  There was this dog once, I  remember this a few years  back, and he was just hungry,  so he went downstairs and  decided to eat, I believe it  was a prime rib.  Uh, during, um, a  basketball game.  And, uh, somebody, remain 
[02:51:30]  nameless, came downstairs and  saw the prime rib on the  floor and the dog eating it,  and wound up and kicked this  fucking dog so hard in the  liver that it let out a yelp  that the owner heard from  upstairs.  The owner went, I'll, I'll  change the names.  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  I'll change the names to  protect the innocent.  The owner went, is that you,  Lester?  Is that my Lester? 
[02:52:00]  Why are you making noises?  Come on, Chester!  And some months later, uh, Lester  died of liver cancer.  Uh, was diagnosed as liver  cancer, but I believe it was the  blow to the liver that ended,  How does a kick cause cancer?  Ended the, I don't think it was  cancer.  How does a kick cause cancer?  I think it was a subdural  hematoma.  I think it was, uh, the kick  that killed the dog. 
[02:52:30]  And, um, yes, uh, somebody  named Craig Hughes, I believe,  was, uh, in the house at the  time.  Uh, so there's allegations  that, um, perhaps.  Let's talk about Tiffy, you  sick fuck.  Little Tiffy Toodles.  Little Tiffy Toodles.  Skippy.  You want to talk dogs, let's  talk about Tiffy Toodles.  What, would I flick him in the  face?  With your fist?  No, I flicked Tiffy in the  nose with my finger.  Yeah, but the dog weighed a  half a pound.  Yeah.  A flick is like a punch from  Muhammad Ali. 
[02:53:00]  Sent that thing back a few  feet.  And then it would go,  pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft,  for a while.  Tiffy Toodles?  Tiffy.  I remember Tiffy, I don't  remember the Toodles part.  Tiffy.  Tiffy.  The yip-yip dog.  Yeah.  And all yip-yip dogs.  You've ruined a lot.  Oh, come on.  Hello, Rich.  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[02:53:30]  Hey, man.  What's up, Rich?  You've ruined a lot in my  days of listening to your  show, but I will not stand  by him unless you ruin this  episode of T-Trama.  Wow, man.  It's too good.  I'm telling you, it is the  only TV show that I've ever  leaked a tier to.  Now, is this the best, the  episode, the Futurama episode,  the one fans would talk about  the most?  By far.  Give me a copy.  I'm going to watch the whole  fucking thing.  All right. 
[02:54:00]  It's either that one or the one  where Frye is his own  grandfather, but that one's not  nearly as tear-jerking.  All right.  Let me go to Chrissy because  we're really bothering her  today.  Chrissy in Iowa.  Chrissy, we lose you?  Chrissy.  Ah, we lost her.  Where is the bitch?  All right.  If she can call back, that'd be  great.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Hey, boy.  I got to call Anthony out.  Yes.  I recall about a year ago when  Jack-Jack left.  Anthony was pretty heartbroken  and pretty broken up over it 
[02:54:30]  because I remember making some  other distressful comments on  the air about he was missing  little Jack-Jack.  I never got emotional about  Jack-Jack leaving.  You're like the other cat.  I forgot the name.  The one that did dog tricks.  It was the most bizarre thing.  Oh, J.D.  J.D. ruled.  J.D. ruled.  J.D. was the coolest cat ever.  No, Jack-Jack, you know, it was  cool and all and everything like  that, but, you know, c'est la vie.  It's how it goes.  You were bummed when you couldn't 
[02:55:00]  have J.D. around anymore.  Yeah, you know, I was bummed.  It was kind of, you know, a cool  company and everything, but I  wasn't going to fucking start  faggot crying over it.  Holy shit.  Enough.  It's a stupid animal that shits  in a box.  When was the last time you  cried?  Holy shit.  For real.  Beyond me.  I can't fucking remember.  I know it's the cool thing to  say, you know.  No, I can't remember.  Because we're not supposed to  cry as men.  I understand all that.  When was the last time you  actually shed a tear? 
[02:55:30]  I can't remember.  For real?  I can't remember.  When you were a kid with the  spaghetti flying?  No, no.  After that, you know, it's  mandatory when your fucking dad  drops dead that you got to cry.  So, okay, probably then 95,  94.  So from 94 on 95.  I've been a rock.  Not even a little teary  eyeballs.  No.  As we call it in my family.  I used to make fun of each  other.  Teary eyeballs.  There probably has been, but I 
[02:56:00]  can't remember offhand.  I'm not talking a big over the  top.  But maybe a little moisture  building up.  I'm trying to remember.  You're like, holy shit, I  think I might fucking drop a  tear here.  I really can't can't remember  anything.  Come on.  No.  It could even be some stupid  like a dumb movie or  something.  I'm trying to think of a  movie movie or you get one  of those.  You feel it coming from deep.  Yeah, probably had that.  Yeah, I have had that during  movie, but I couldn't tell you 
[02:56:30]  what movie or anything.  When the suitcase bomb blows up  in Valkyrie and you weren't  sure if he was still alive.  I know that.  Oh, my God.  Adolf, are you OK?  Are you OK?  What about you, Jimmy?  The last time you cried for  real.  I'll always say I'm trying to  think.  Ghost Town on the plane made  me bawl like a little bitch.  What?  What part?  Because I saw that movie  recently.  At the end.  That you weren't in it, but  Bob Kelly was.  That made me sick.  That was when I had to reach  for the airship bed. 
[02:57:00]  But they were going over and  they were resolving all the  stuff at the end.  Let's just say that.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  There was another movie that  got me recently, too.  Oh, Slumdog Millionaire.  Ew.  What part?  Really?  Just the part.  Let's just say the ending.  When they switched the scene  from the 14 year old girl and  made her an adult.  Yes.  I got a little teary.  So many years we missed.  I know.  I try easy at movies.  A good movie. 
[02:57:30]  I cry.  Yes.  Somebody somebody had one fly  by here on Pal Talk.  That was one of those that got  me was the yeah.  The last episode of Band of  Brothers.  That was a good one.  When they have the actual  soldiers that you had just  watched the characters  portraying through the whole  series and they started  talking about their  experiences.  That was pretty good one.  Also, the other one  Saving Private Ryan at the  end of that with the old  man with the old man.  It's always old soldier  shit.  That's probably what gets me 
[02:58:00]  most.  If you don't cry.  Old soldier shit.  That old soldier shit  doesn't make you cry.  Then you're just you're not  a human being.  Yeah.  That stuff is like, you  know, because they still  it's fucking 50 years, 60  years later.  And they're like, you know,  and me and my buddy went  up the hill.  Sorry.  Hold on.  You're with these guys.  They become your brothers  and your friends.  Do the whole thing. 
[02:58:30]  And hold on.  So we're German 88s and we  went into the trenches around  the back.  And I remember Kowalski.  You know what that is?  It's you're trying to push  the emotion back down.  Stay down there.  Stay down there.  Stay down there.  He took it out.  He was always the one back  back at the camp that would  make everyone laugh.  Always had a big smile on  his face. 
[02:59:00]  And I looked over and I saw  him laying there and he's  bleeding.  Take the camera off me.  I can't talk right now.  I'll tell you later.  Get all busted.  Nice.  And I'm sitting there like  Kowalski.  Blue Healer has big fish.  Big tearjerker.  I heard that movie is  ridiculous.  But it came out when my dad  passed.  Oh that one.  I had to blow that one  off.  Yeah I still haven't seen it.  Is it good?  Yeah it's pretty good.  That one okay.  That might get you too. 
[02:59:30]  You know right?  If you got a dad in the  ground.  If you're lucky enough to  have a dead dad it's a good  movie.  Oh I'm lucky enough.  I'm part of the club.  If you're one of the  lucky devils with a  skeleton dad.  Let's high five.  I know we don't like to  touch but let's high five  dead dads.  High five.  Dead dad club.  Yeah.  Who's in the dead dad club?  Anybody else?  I'm not.  Oh it's so much fun.  Let us know when you're  joining Jim.  You'll know.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  He'll have little red eyes.  He'll miss a day's work. 
[03:00:00]  He'll still do gigs down at  the cellar.  He's very dedicated.  Anthony everyone is  bringing this up so I just  gotta ask and I apologize  ahead of time.  What about when you write  the big check every quarter?  Alright one tear does  smear the ink when I'm  signing that check.  That's more just anger  though.  Yes that's tears of  anger.  That's an anger thing.  Oh here's a girl  disagreeing with E-Rock.  A girl.  Carrie.  Yes.  Hey.  Hi.  Hi Carrie. 
[03:00:30]  What do you got for the  show?  Well I was calling to  agree with Jimmy.  Thank you.  On what?  I saw the episode and I  didn't cry a bit but I  think it's the dog's own  dumb fault that he died if  he's not smart enough to go  and figure out hey he's not  coming back.  Exactly.  I'll go find some food.  That dog's an asshole.  And didn't the dog have a  new owner the pizza guy?  No.  He sort of did.  Yeah he did.  He fed him and stuff.  He fed him and stuff.  Patted him on the head it  looked like.  And a dog's stupid brain 
[03:01:00]  that's good.  That's my owner so I'm  sitting out here because my  owner is inside.  That's what he thinks.  Oh the owner was just  feeding him because the  dog was always there.  But that was the dog's  new owner and his stupid  little dog brain.  Why was the dog out there?  He was waiting for him.  Shut up.  Oh God that's right I did.  Jason's right.  I did cry at that.  What?  Damn.  Where are we going?  Jason in Chicago.  All right.  That was a biggie.  November 4th.  Oh really?  I'm sorry.  All right thank you Jason. 
[03:01:30]  Thanks for the call.  Oh it's old Jimmy  punchline runer.  I apologize.  I'm across the room.  I could not read it.  That's funny.  I honestly.  What were you going to  say?  Go ahead.  Jason how does it.  I hope it was fucking  good because it's useless  now isn't it?  Jason how does it feel  that you probably had a  great line that would  have got a huge massive  laugh that you don't get  to tell now.  What were you going to  say?  Oh da da da da.  You prick.  Go ahead Jason.  Yeah Jason go ahead. 
[03:02:00]  All right guys.  The way I said Obama  really.  I mean.  Oh sorry.  Oh God.  And to boot.  Anthony cried what Obama  wanted.  Seriously man you and me  we're fucking done  professionally.  You're lucky I stepped  in.  He would have squashed  that concept by tripping  on the boy.  Fuck's sake man you're  amateur.  All right well you try  there buddy.  Yeah.  Oh Chrissy called back.  Let's see what she's got.  Chrissy.  Chrissy.  She went into the water  and jaws and got eaten.  Chrissy. 
[03:02:30]  Where are you going?  Swimming.  Whee.  Chrissy.  I'm going to have my  pussy bitten out.  Yeah.  Chrissy.  Yeah.  Hi.  What do you have to say  to the Opie and Anthony  program?  First of all aunt.  Yeah.  One night with me sweetheart  and I would get you crying.  Really.  Oh wow.  How fat are you.  Yeah exactly.  What is your name  Jennifer?  Yeah.  What would make Anthony  cry about you?  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  You sassy bitch.  Oh my god I'm blushing.  Are you?  The only answer is I'd be  crying at the difficulty  of your homework.  That's the only way that  works.  Exactly.  Damn it it's hard for me  to color inside the line  still.  Yeah.  What do you have to say  No but I wanted to say  for the record I'm  I'm actually a emergency  room nurse so I've got  a job.  You know a lot of like  bad stuff.  Strike one.  And I tell you what  you show me a dog in 
[03:03:30]  distress and I am like  falling.  All right.  All right.  Get a hold of yourself.  Exactly.  You're fucking panicking.  Falling apart.  I don't even.  Someone just mentioned  Sinatra's when I was  17.  It was a very good year.  Shut up.  Cigars and scotch.  Oh you're killing me.  That's.  I.  Oh.  Thanks cigars.  At the end of my dad's  life I would go over and  see him and he would sit  in his chair and play  that song.  Yeah.  That's a depressing song  under any circumstances.  It is brutal. 
[03:04:00]  Send in the clowns.  Ugh.  Fuck the clowns.  What do you want?  Sorry.  Is Iraq.  Did Iraq.  Oh I thought Iraq farted  and was fanning it in  Jimmy's face.  But no.  Jimmy farted and Iraq is  merely trying to push it  back.  Push it back into  Jimmy's face.  Pay it forward.  They're playing fart  tennis.  Let's go to DK and MD.  DK and MD.  What's up?  Hey what's up?  Hey man.  Soldier stuff and it was  at the end of Band of  Brothers.  The.  Right. 
[03:04:30]  And son said grandpa  were you a hero in World  War II?  And he said no grandpa  wasn't a hero but he  served with a company a  hero.  Yes.  Jesus.  Oh was that a good one.  The original lie was no  grandpa wasn't a hero.  He was a war criminal who  raped 13 year olds and  spent his time in the  brig.  And what a disgrace  grandpa was.  Company of heroes what  were you doing you  fucking yellow belly?  Yellow belly.  He would always run 
[03:05:00]  away.  Of course he was.  He would always give  the enemy the positions  so they wouldn't shoot  him.  He pulled the dead  soldiers over top of  him in the foxholes.  Yeah and fucking  rifled through their  pockets.  No.  I wasn't a hero but  I stole out of the  pockets from a few of  them.  Fuck grandpa.  Grandpa was a fucking  jizz bag.  Fuck grandpa in the  mouth.  Yeah fuck grandpa right  in his aging armpits.  Right in his loose  asshole.  Yeah exactly.  Footer what do you  got?  Yo Ant you're crying 
[03:05:30]  every day when you  leave that show and  you just crack that  beer open and just  soak that liver with  alcohol like you do  every day.  That's trying dude.  So here's a word of  advice.  Jesus.  Crying.  Light punchline  advice.  You don't want to  say every day twice.  You're crying every day  when you leave and  you're doing this  every day.  Oh you know what  I'm sorry I panicked.  What about the  mouse?  What are some cups  of water?  I cry that I ever  made that joke.  All right good job.  Excuse for a joke.  Well well well isn't it  nice and open  Anthony having a nice  little show because 
[03:06:00]  all I got to say is  I'm Bender and you  can bite my shiny  mouth.  Sam for this segment we  have a special guest  calling in.  Do you know the name  Bob Gale?  Of course I know the  name Bob Gale.  Who is he?  He co-wrote and  produced Back to the  Future as well as  Jim's favorite movie  Used Cars.  Very well read.  Bob's on the phone. 
[03:06:30]  Anthony decides to  get Danny and Travis  in there for this  discussion so they  could all talk about  the saga of Back to  the Future ask all  their fanboy questions  and where was  primetime Sam  Roberts when this  was going on?  You were nowhere to  be found.  All right well then  you take the rest of  this.  And then Opie also  punched out.  Oh we were probably  off hanging out.  So I think it was  just those three guys  and Bob Gale on the  phone and everyone  else.  Oh Norton was there  too.  I think unwillingly  but he was there.  Well back to the  future talk. 
[03:07:00]  With Bob Gale.  Enjoy it.  40 minutes.  Anthony are you  very excited to talk  to Bob Gale?  Of course I want  Travis in here too  on mic because  Travis is a giant  fan.  Have fun guys.  No hey.  Have fun.  You've got to get  back.  I don't need to be  here for this.  Bob Gale.  What?  Who is Bob Gale 
[03:07:30]  by the way?  Who is Bob Gale?  Bob co-wrote  Back to the Future  a little film you  might have heard of  with Robert Zemeckis  and wrote Back to  the Future 2 and 3.  He also co-produced  on all three films.  I want to actually  know exactly what  his input was.  He also wrote  please more  importantly  used cars.  Did he really?  One of the funniest  films ever.  Ever.  Yes.  Jimmy is constantly  talking about used  cars.  It's very funny. 
[03:08:00]  And I want to  hold your hand.  Wasn't that  Beatles movie  with Spielberg  made?  I'm not sure.  We'll have to ask  him.  He's on the phone.  Why don't we  talk to him?  Hey Bob.  Welcome to the  Opie and Anthony  show.  Hey.  Thanks guys.  You got three or  four guys here that  are obsessed with  the Back to the Future  series.  Sweet.  Thanks.  No joke.  There's an obsession  that is a little  creepy.  Bob.  What what I got  to ask you first.  What the hell is it  about Back to the  Future that this 
[03:08:30]  many years later  people still are  buying it on DVD  find it fascinating  entertaining.  I think that the  core idea of it is  just something that  strikes everybody.  I mean what's  amazing to me is  how all these kids  today little kids  I mean my daughter  wasn't born when the  movie was made.  She and all of her  friends in college  they've seen.  Neither was my  girlfriend.  It's just a  universal thing that  everybody comes to  the realization oh 
[03:09:00]  my god at one time  my parents were  children.  They were kids  the same age as  me.  Right.  And that's just a  fascinating idea and  you know nobody  really really explored  that idea to the  degree that we did  before our movie.  Did you come up  with the basic the  actual idea of this  guy going back in  time and it kind of  screwing up?  Well the way it  started Zemeck and I 
[03:09:30]  always talked about  trying to figure out  how to do a time  travel movie because  we both had our  minds warped watching  the Twilight Zone and  the George Powell  time machine movie but  we never were able to  figure out the hook  and then I was  actually back visiting  my parents in St.  Louis on a  promotional trip for  used cars and  digging through my  basement I found my  father's high school  yearbook and I was  thumbing through it and 
[03:10:00]  there was my father  and he was the  president of his  graduating class and  I started thinking  about the president of  my graduating class  who was you know one  of these kind of  rah-rah asshole  guys and I'm  thinking my god if I  had gone to high  school with my dad  would I have been  friends with him or  would I have had  nothing to do with  him so that that  was the germ of the  idea to make a time  travel story that was  a little different than  anything else what if  you could go to high  school with your  parents so when I got 
[03:10:30]  back to California I  started talking to  Zemeckis about this and  he got excited about it  he said yeah what if it  turned out that your  mom was a slut  and then it just the  snowball got rolling  and we pitched it over  at Columbia because  they really like used  cars even though the  movie hadn't done much  at the box office they  said you want to do  your next movie and we  set it up there and in  true Hollywood fashion  after we wrote two 
[03:11:00]  drafts of the script they  said well now we don't  want to make it and it  took us almost four years  after that to finally get  the movie in a box  is it true that Disney  wouldn't take the movie  because it was too the  subject matter was a  little too risque for  even Disney  yeah actually that's  that's absolutely true  we we shopped the movie  around and and at the  time launch the early  80s launch comedy was  was the big thing they  wanted you know stripes  stuff stuff that was it  was more gross and I 
[03:11:30]  kept so well back it's  it's a really nice script  it's really sweet there's  this got this family thing  going on you guys ought  to take this to Disney  yeah right it's over and  over again and finally  we've been rejected by  every studio and we said  well what the hell let's  go take it to Disney see  what they say so we we  have a meeting over there  and this was way before  Disney got itself revamped  and so this was the old  the old Disney management  that was making such great  movies as as Tron and the 
[03:12:00]  black hole so so we go in  and the guy said are you  guys nuts we can't make  this movie here this scene  with the kid and his  mother in the car and  there's an attempted rape  what are you thinking  yeah that that we we  always uh we always do talk  a lot about the um content  of it and the fact that it  is a comedy um it's it's  considered by a lot of  people on the outside as a 
[03:12:30]  very innocent movie uh but  some of the scenes in  there and some of the  language you could not  put in a movie today that  that is marketed to the  same people it was  marketed to um back when  this came out well pg-13  didn't exist back then so  we have a pg rating and  yeah we i mean we have  shits and goddams and  that sort of stuff which  you know we just it was in  there because that was  that's the way kids talk  you know yeah that way  then and they still talk  that way it's worse  probably but i mean like 
[03:13:00]  i can remember being a  kid and like they would  show back to the future  for you know like we  have like movie day or  whatever it was like in  the auditorium and uh i  remember being uncomfortable  as a kid like watching  you know biff try to you  know get it on with uh  with lorraine in the car  and i'm like i don't think  this is i'm in third grade  i'm not supposed to be  watching this like this is  this is a little  inappropriate for me  this is dirty and  obviously it totally  destroyed your well all  your thought processes  didn't it it is one of my  favorite movies of all  time i just it's just  so strange how you would 
[03:13:30]  never even you i don't  think that kind of  subject like if if that  movie was re-released in  the theater now i mean  it would probably get an  r rating yeah yeah well  well no i don't think  it'd get an r rating but  it would certainly get a  pg-13 yeah they'd have  one of those disclaimers  for mild language and  yeah strong sexual content  and almost a rape yeah  and by the way yeah what  i always wondered why  george would have uh biff  come over and be his car  wax guy when he tried to  rape his wife  well it just shows what 
[03:14:00]  a what a what a decent  forgiving guy there you  go i was wondering about  that it came for you mr  mcfly i think it's your  new book remember when i  tried to rape your  girlfriend yeah and not  to mention the incest yeah  they are the whole  incestuous angle they are  kissing they are mother and  and son even though they're  the same age at the time  uh any flack from that as  far as uh when you went 
[03:14:30]  before the ratings board  no no none at all no they  were fine with it was the  only one that really got  upset with it but but we  dealt with it with it you  know with a comedic touch so  that you just knew this was  not serious and it was just  never going to really there  nothing was going to actually  really happen in there that  was actually we were writing  the script it was one of the  things that we kept saying  well how are we going to get  out of this yeah how are we  going to get out of this and  we came up with the idea well 
[03:15:00]  okay it's like kissing my  brother you know lorraine has  that line right right we said  well okay we can do that  because this situation has  never actually ever happened  before yes it might seem like  that i think i get asked this a  lot but i mean uh the i'm sure  all the hardcore fans know out  there that uh back to the future  originally was cast with eric  stultz as marty mcfly that's  correct and everybody wants to  know when this footage because  it's nowhere it's one of the  only things that you just cannot  find i mean most look we we we 
[03:15:30]  did not destroy the footage the  footage exists and we thought of  back back in 2002 when the movie  first came out in dvd um the  next time i had a long  conversation about whether or not  we should put any of this stuff on  there and we decided not to  because uh at this time because  you know eric's still a working  actor um he didn't do anything  wrong you know it was our mistake  you know we miscast it but what was 
[03:16:00]  the mistake like what did you see  in him that that made you say like  oh boy this ain't the right guy was  it the rocky dennis makeup and mask  and he was just running around like  called you know retard going back to  the future and he's still stupid  jesus christ jimmy yeah that would  that would have been that would  have been what we would do in back  to the future too when biff messed  everything yeah that's a different  timeline  uh yeah well eric was a good actor  and the studio the head of the 
[03:16:30]  studio was just so extremely bullish  on him because he loved the movie  mask that i mean he you know he he  really was kind of an overbearing guy  and it was he said to us in a in a  moment of of bravura he just said i'm  so convinced that eric stoltz will be  great in this movie that if he's not  you guys recast it and start all over  now he never expected we would take  him up on that because he thought eric  stoltz would just be great and he 
[03:17:00]  wasn't so when after five weeks uh bob  had put enough footage together where  he realized that it wasn't working the  way it was supposed to work and he had  uh neil canton my co-producer and i  look at the footage because i never  would look at cut footage until there  was a entire cut of the movie so i knew  there was a problem bob was asking me to  come in the cutting room oh boy yeah in  the screening room and then we all we 
[03:17:30]  we all said oh shit  we had uh... spielberg and and and  kathy kenny frank marshall our executive  producers look at it and they said oh  shit and uh... we decided and and and  steven in his infinite wisdom said look  um... you can't go tell scheinberg that  you've made a mistake here without having  a way to solve the mistake but let me  was there was he acting clowny or was 
[03:18:00]  he not acting clowny enough because  he's he's he's you know sort of the  method school of acting um so he went  into the future to prepare for his role  well he had to wear the wardrobe home he  he just didn't have a sense of comedy  that that the character needed right now  is it is i mean i know it's it's been  asked a thousand times but i mean will  that footage ever come out and be  available to the public maybe on a  future blu-ray release well i say i  don't know i don't know if we'll i  don't know it'll be later rather than 
[03:18:30]  sooner because say we we don't we  don't want the footage to embarrass  eric um that good huh people are going  to talk yeah when anybody says some  people say well it wasn't that bad  somebody oh my god how stupid were  those idiots were putting that guy  um but i say anything that's going to  make somebody else look bad it's  hysterical you know when when uh when  when we're all you know in our 60s or 
[03:19:00]  70s then maybe we'll say okay yeah now  this it's it's so far you know oh just  put it on youtube already just throw it  up there you got you guys kind of got  stuck in a little bit of a problem with  the end of back to the future one  everybody knows the whole thing with  uh you know marty it's your kids uh  uh and and you had to resolve that um  had you wished you known beforehand  that you would have had a sequel and  and didn't end it that way well the 
[03:19:30]  thing is um if we knew we were going to  do a sequel we would have never had  jennifer get in the car right because  that that was the that was the big that  was the big problem right what are we  going to do with jennifer i mean she's it  should have just stopped where he went  like hey let's drop this bitch off  marty and then they just land back drop  her off in the house and take off again  or maybe after they take what we do we  had to be unconscious for the whole  sequel yeah she was completely  unconscious for the whole movie did you  did you think it was really weird 
[03:20:00]  though like having jack warden played  two roles hey you're talking about  used cars now jimmy don't talk about  oh we're talking about back to the movie  actually what's that used cars the  reason that we got jack warden when we  wrote the script we we didn't think of  the think of those brothers as as being  played by the same actor and uh actually  at one point kevin conway was gonna was  gonna play uh roy fuchs and then he he  decided not to so we we went after jack 
[03:20:30]  warden and warden passed on it and then  i forget who it was that said uh you  know there's three things that there's  three things that an actor likes to do  they like to play they like to act  drunk they like to play dead and they  like to play more than one role in the  same movie and then use cars if you make  them if you make the two brothers be  played by the same guy he'll get to do  he'll get to play dead and play two parts  and it's interesting that you that you  use that same tactic in the back to the 
[03:21:00]  future series when uh michael j fox is  playing obviously his entire well most of  his his immediate family yes well look  that was that was just a slam dunk  obvious thing to do you you gotta do  that i did have a little bit of an  issue with three though it being that  his uh forefathers and mother uh looked  the same now that would be a coincidence  because their children would have had  been married off to another family so  why would his wife look just like now 
[03:21:30]  okay there's an answer to that all  right we thought about that i mean the  you know the the the practical answer  was uh leah thompson is one of the  greatest people in the world to work  with and bob and i said we can't make  another back to the future movie without  putting leah in it so that was that was  number one we just liked working with  her she's just just a pleasure to work  with and then we said okay well it's  always said that men are attracted to  women that remind them of their mothers  oh wow throughout the generations yes 
[03:22:00]  there you go all right well whatever  works so so so you're basically saying  that she was available and frank mccray  couldn't do it um because he was doing a  project after you's cars now frank mccray  the interview one of the funniest guys  ever frank mc big black guy in 48 hours  he was the uh eddie murphy's uh boss the  cop yeah and that's whatever happened to  frank mccray do you know boy i've lost  touch with frank i i i don't know what 
[03:22:30]  happened to frank you see you know  fairly regularly but i don't know about  10 or 15 years ago i kind of i have no  idea he's showing a little old guy the  car he's like it's all big and comfy and  roomy and you got to look at the guy's  like i don't want to look inside like oh  just look inside the guy's like i don't  want to look inside so he grabs the  little old man and just shoves him in  the car oh get in the motherfucking car  it's fucking hilarious but just get in  the motherfucking car because he's a  mechanic he's not a car salesman yeah  oh just get in the motherfucking car 
[03:23:00]  that was funny the greatest thing that  frank uh has lived in in back to the  future because that that thing was  scripted because because it was a pay  payoff the setup to the gag was for  russell saying no matter what you do make  sure you get the customer in the car  yeah nothing sells the car better than  the car itself get the customer in the  car so just get this guy in the car  but speaking of cars how did you decide  on the delorean for back to the future  as the time as the time vehicle very  good danny that was just oh man that  zemeckis came up with that he said what 
[03:23:30]  if we what if we use a delorean um the  original is if you guys are total back  to the future oh you know it was a  refrigerator hello it was a time chamber  that was like an old refrigerator that's  just silly and then yeah it was it had to  be carted around on the back of a truck  yeah and didn't it did what we didn't  the original script call for the the  the refrigerator time device to be kind  of uh uh dragged by a nuclear test  facility and that's how that's what the  reaction was to initiate time travel 
[03:24:00]  that's crazy well spielberg ripped it  off in indiana jones for all right yeah  yeah that's something at the beginning  where harrison ford is running around in  the in the fake town and that was all  the script of back to the and he goes in  the refrigerator and lives through a  nuclear explosion by being in a  refrigerator yeah spielberg ripped us off  yeah motherfucker damn him so so  basically like because the weird things  that translate like we're all laverne and  shirley fans and when you decided to put  lenny and squiggy in used cars uh as the 
[03:24:30]  cameraman how great my favorite line is  probably when they're filming the the the  hijacked commercial and that is that  woman by the way whose shirt gets ripped  off and her tits pop out is that betty  thomas from hill street blues no no the  the girl in the commercial was cheryl  rickson she was the penthouse pen of the  year oh okay because someone betty thomas  is one of the girls uh there's there's  the uh there's the strip promotion where  six girls are taking off their clothes on 
[03:25:00]  top of the cars and one of them is betty  thomas oh that's okay i mix up the  scenes but one of my favorite things when  that girl is getting her shirt ripped off  like the hood pops up and her shirt gets  ripped off and they're on live tv and he  goes and like i think it's uh squeaky  goes oh jesus she's caught on the hood  on him and he goes oh don't you hate  women that's like all those years of  film school paid off and when does he  when does he say uh oh don't you hate  women he doesn't say that you're talking  about jimmy please don't tell me he 
[03:25:30]  doesn't say that you're ruining  everything i want to talk about i think  he's a young actor called crispin glover  i think you're wrong though bob uh what  happened now put that letterman stuff  back on after joaquin phoenix's  yeah yeah i know his a weird appearance  on that uh uh show but but uh he he  didn't want to do the the second one i  guess huh no no crispin he you know  there's some actors that think that uh  that uh you know popcorn movies are are 
[03:26:00]  just they're they're just awful things  they're true artistes you know and uh  and and crispin was in that mode uh and  he i don't even remember him whether he  even saw the movie really finish he he  sure he certainly didn't show up at the  cats and crew screening and he he  actually uh he sued didn't he the the  production company or the movie company  yeah yeah he sued we you know we we offered  him before we even wrote the sequel bob and 
[03:26:30]  i said okay look before we can even agree  to the sequel we need to know that we got  michael j fox and christopher lloyd to come  back so we uh we we called those guys up and  we said if we do a sequel will you guys be  in it i said absolutely you guys are doing  it we're in so we made the deals with those  guys first then bob and i said okay well  let's see how much how many other members  of the cast will want to come back for  another one so leah thompson said i'm in  and tom wilson played biff said i'm in and  uh crispin said well and his agent called 
[03:27:00]  and said well crispin wants uh michael j fox's  deal which was two million dollars and he  wants uh script approval and i said to the  agent look i said come on i i'm not even  gonna i'm not even gonna dignify that  with a response it's crazy you know michael j fox on the  on the number one television show in america  um of course he's gonna get two million dollars for this  um how much are they offering crispin glover how much less 
[03:27:30]  oh the the final offer that we made to crispin  first of all crispin wouldn't even  he wouldn't even budge off of that  so so we said okay well shit  um i i said i said to the agent i want you to tell  i want you to tell your client two words richard castellano you know who  richard castellano is no oh come on guys exactly  clemenza in the godfather exactly okay right he he was a stickler about  about uh wanting too much money for godfather part two 
[03:28:00]  so francis killed him right yep clemenza's dead  he's a black armband in the godfather too  so we said i said to the agent look we can always  have crispin be dead in the future there's no you know  george mcfly could be dead  um tell your client that if if you don't want to  if you guys don't want to and the agent knew that this was insane  what crispin was asking for but  uh two weeks later the agent called me back and she said no sorry  he he won't budge i said okay and so 
[03:28:30]  bob and i said okay we've got we've got leah we got  we got biff we got lorraine we don't have george  so let's make george into a tombstone so the whole idea  of the alternate 1985 where uh where lorraine had married biff  came about because uh crispin didn't want to be in the movie  wow damn yeah well it works  about two months before the movie was going to start shooting  uh crispin's agent called and said well crispin thinks maybe he made a mistake 
[03:29:00]  oops i said okay well we're happy to put him in the movie but it's not  going to be a very big role um and and the whole idea by the way  of having you know in the future you see george mcfly  floating around upside down and yeah because he threw out his back  well we thought to ourselves okay if we have  we didn't want to really have george dead in the in the in the positive in the  more positive future because that would be kind of sad  let's hold let's let's put the guy upside down so if we have to recast him 
[03:29:30]  it'll be hard to recognize whether it's really it's hairs in front of his face  and if crispin really does it then we can hang him upside down like the  like the dentist from ed wood he's yeah just put your cape over your face  eyebrows up he looks just like him i think i think by the way that you're wrong  about that line bob i hate to correct the guy that wrote it but i do think that he  says uh jesus he's caught on the hood ornament oh don't you hate women oh yeah  okay okay you're right oh there you go there you go i haven't seen in a while 
[03:30:00]  okay stand corrected why would you know is there  don't argue with the geeks i know has there ever been uh have you ever been  approached to remake back to the future because so much  you asking me or him no not you jimmy uh because so much stuff is being remade  now from the 80s has anybody ever like brought that up to you hollywood  no no and you know what because i think that we've we've said so many times  look indiana jones part four is the perfect reason why we don't go back  to that hmm well not not sure not even like a back to the future four just like 
[03:30:30]  remaking it with different cast well all that we can do if we did that is fail  oh i i agree i was just wondering if it's ever been presented so you know nobody's talked  to nobody said well we're going to remake this with you guys or without well then we'd say  you know you're crazy but go ahead all anybody's going to say is boy they  fucked it up they're not really geniuses and they've  fucked it up they're remaking this if you were going to if you were to do a 
[03:31:00]  remake of back to the future would you give marty more than 10 minutes to save  doc's life at the end and when he's getting shot up by libyan terrorists  i always thought that was a uh it was a strange judgment call on marty's part  thinking that like 10 minutes would be perfect to go and save uh uh uh a uh  unarmed marty mcfly by the way was going to uh take care of three libyan  terrorists one one has a rocket launcher but marty decides 10 minutes is  perfect yeah i'm going to take care of this in 10 minutes why not more time for  marty well you guys you guys remember what it was 
[03:31:30]  like when you were in high school i mean you know he's a 17 year old kid  he's stupid he's just stupid i have a back to the future  question okay jimmy's got one yes would you uh when putting michael j  fox in the back of a convertible teach him to hide better  that is funny he's just yapping on that walkie-talkie  but biff is such an idiot that uh you know he might not notice that he's very self-centered 
[03:32:00]  yeah yeah would you change the name of it so the porno couldn't be called black to the future  which it was there was a porno made called backsides  what do you think about all these uh uh t-shirt companies that are trying to cash  in on like the 80s nostalgia and you know they're putting out back to the future t-shirts and i'm  i'm sure you know tanny wears them all the time i am guilty i'm guilty travis is guilty we're all  guilty but if it's licensed material i'm all for it yeah yeah but what if maybe it's not though 
[03:32:30]  well you know what that's up to the legal department of universal to go after that  speaking of universal uh were you attached to any of those sets that uh caught fire on uh on the  back to the future said i know that was big news and it was a it was a it was a terrible terrible  loss for all of us here well look i was asked that at the time you know aren't you upset about  this and i said come on it's a set you know sets are not built to be permanent they're built to be  taken down and um they've rebuilt it it's it's all pretty much the way it was it's what i was more 
[03:33:00]  worried about was uh was the film vaults where they had all the answers and stuff that's the stuff  that that would be hard to replace studios are all burning down all the time well i know for a  long time they stored the film the film vaults have they were made of straw have they stopped doing  that yeah i think that i think that the second little they moved it into the second little pigs  house are there any plans to put uh the animated series on dvd boy if there are i don't know about 
[03:33:30]  it you know people keep writing into universal asking them to do it i frequently will call them  up and say hey people are clamoring for this but uh now you just have to get the bootlegs i got a  question what are you having for breakfast a cup of coffee and a bowl of blackberries ah very good  i just want to know i i know that the uh disc that just came out has the uh video from the ride  uh when that first came out uh what did you think of it because i i was amazed at the um the back to 
[03:34:00]  the future ride oh it was look for for me you know i never got to experience back to the future of the  movie the way everybody else did just walking into it saying holy shit yeah so i got to go do the ride  and i said holy shit wow i was sometimes at uh during our lunch breaks when when i when we had  an office at universal uh my secretary and i would say hey let's let's let's go ride the ride oh you 
[03:34:30]  and the secretary yeah let's go ride the ride and then we'll go to the back to the future ride  and uh people are wondering um i'm reading a couple of things up here uh future biff uh when  he goes in there he he looks a little out of sorts when he gets out and breaks his cane is that because  he is uh indeed disappearing because he has changed his own uh future yes and if you if uh whoever wrote  that in if you get your hands on the dvd and god damn it go out and buy it today i got it my friend 
[03:35:00]  in the deleted scenes i'm pretty sure we have the extension on that uh we actually had him  erased from existence uh and we previewed that uh previewed the movie with that in it and the  audience just didn't understand it dumb audience and half of them didn't and we said well all right  let's just let's just give him a stomach ache as he's getting out of a car that'll clear it up for  uh so uh bob back to the future four go back to the future four yeah get out of here what uh what 
[03:35:30]  would it be uh and uh let me ask you the question and see if you can um come up with the accurate  answer when in what time period is there the most deloreans in one spot in the movie yeah and all in  the whole series during which time is there the most deloreans in one actual area are you talking 
[03:36:00]  about about movie reality or when we were actually shooting them oh i'm talking about movie reality  screw the shooting of the movie and how many of those cars you went through who cares i'm talking  about what it was how many deloreans occupied thinking about it i don't think that there were  ever more than more than two in the same wrong wrong mr ryder guy wrong one at the mall given  the reality of back to the future three you had the two deloreans at the mall and you had the one 
[03:36:30]  stashed in the cave two in the mall one in the cave it's like two in this one of the stink two in  the pain no it's not like that at all it's a shocker danny please explain um i don't have my notes  fully give me one moment it's easy okay go there's one from the old west that is just sitting  waiting in the cave waiting in the cave right there's that one so that's there the whole time 
[03:37:00]  up until 1985 uh five okay then there's right then there's okay then there's a wait wait that's  until 1955 until 1955 right right yeah okay so in 1955 there's one in the cave one in the cave there's  the one that marty originally takes back in one right then there's the one from two the one from  two there's two marty's in 1955 right so okay so that's three three and now the the fourth one is  in 1955 isn't that when old biff goes back oh yeah to give to give young to give young 
[03:37:30]  biff the almanac so that's that's four you're still awake  i'm here but you guys aren't you guys aren't figuring on the ripple effect here oh  timeline yeah yeah the veered off timeline every time you every time you change it it makes a  different timeline absolutely isn't that do you find that kind of funny that you are are that your  story is kind of quoted in science as well that's the back to the future style of time travel 
[03:38:00]  and then there's yeah love it yeah you invented your own physics yeah the branching as opposed to on  lost if you watch that these days you see there it's more of a linear uh time travel where you can  only go backwards and forwards and really not change anything yeah yeah well it it before us it was it  was a ray bradbury version because uh bradbury did you know he he changed stuff in in that story uh 
[03:38:30]  called the sound of thunder where the where the uh the the hunting expeditions would go back to  prehistoric times to kill dinosaurs all right yeah remember that one yes and then uh  on a butterfly someone yeah steps on one thing and screws everything up which is why the butterfly effect  why they called the butterfly effect in in that ashton kutcher movie and uh boy doc brown for  somebody that didn't want to interfere with anything in the future he was one of the biggest  offenders the worst offenders ever it's like uh uh kirk with the prime directive he'd always quote it 
[03:39:00]  but then he just you know have sex with women on other planets but uh it was he was the biggest  offender well yes but but we established that at the end of at the end of the first back to the future  where you know he pulls out the he pulls out the letter taped up and he says ah i figured what the  hell yeah but what the figuring what the hell is a little different than building a time machine  into a steam uh steam engine train and then showing up in the middle of the fucking day 
[03:39:30]  with you know and then the train not only is that weird enough that a train just appears out of  nowhere and this old man from the 1800s pops out but then the thing lifts up off the tracks and flies  away in the middle of the day i mean that might raise a few eyebrows don't you think well that's  why we put it at the very end you don't think about that until you're until you're sitting over your  pizza afterwards yeah what's up and i love the police response time there when a train  hits a car and uh they could walk all over to docks they come back he walks home gets his 
[03:40:00]  chick comes back exchange gifts yeah exchange gifts talk to biff you know we're not talking  the nypd this is hill valley crazy by the way i also want to bring that up that uh mayor goldie wilson  turned out to be an awful mayor uh because uh hill valley was a wonderful place and then goldie wilson  took over and then the theater's a porno theater there's bums sleeping around crazy drunk drivers  goldie wilson stunk as a mayor yeah he sure did he sure did just wanted to add that in well you know 
[03:40:30]  something um i can't say enough about the film yes you can shut up jimmy you know that everybody  here loves it except for two people you said enough about it about a half i think we talk about it much  too much and obsess on it too much but you could say any time get a life because a lot of people  are thinking it we did our own screening i would love to hear this guy tell you guys to get a life  i do have a question though that i want to ask you seriously what is the uh the best 
[03:41:00]  piece of memorabilia that you own from uh the movies very good oh man that's wow i've got um well  the best piece is probably uh the time displays from the from the delorean that got destroyed oh  you got that i've got those in a in a showcase over my fireplace mantel well sam we somehow started  talking about infomercials one in particular was for a cd called cheers to you which would if you

[03:44:30]  this is new i just i just stumbled across like one of my old sweaters that's what they do in these  i don't know why infomercials have to look like they have all that look to them i don't know why  they do that one of the worst infomercials that are on now is for that make your pc run faster  thing you know oh yeah and finally fast yeah yeah and and this the the kid that's playing the video game  it's like mom our internet connection is so slow our computer is so slow i can't play this game 
[03:45:00]  and the game he's playing it's like wolfenstein dude it's it's something from the an 80s arcade  games like tempest and it's not working on his slow computer and then it says for pc only does not  work on mac and every instance you see someone's on a mac saying they must have just had that around  the office right when they were filming it is this guy right here it's clearly a mac yeah yeah he's 
[03:45:30]  like no no it's the angry little snotty kid let me try this again still it's crying yeah look at  that game should be a lot lot faster mom this internet connection is so slow i love my computer  mom i don't know he's playing some game as fast as it you see this guy downloading and you see like  a child's shoe and a child's leg and the guy's trying to jerk off this is too slow he's very  angry he does look like a pedo this guy wait so this is a a newer this is another oh yeah this is oh 
[03:46:00]  yeah dude just came out couple months maybe and did you see the game probably because they couldn't  get the rights for any real games so that's why but still admit i'll try to cure it it's so bad it's  almost like space invaders there look at look at this game oh my god he's playing that yes it looks like  it literally looks worse than uh in the arcades everybody knows a game 1942 yeah it was like a  top-down airplane world war ii battle it's worse than that arcade game you're a plane at the bottom  of the screen and then planes are coming at you from the top of the screen down it's two-dimensional 
[03:46:30]  if if this game is running slow on your computer it's time to get a 486 yeah yeah upgrade to a 486  you have an etch-a-sketch if this is running slow on it what a piece of shit plane game yells mom  can we hear him again please that guy i'm doing this now what are they uh what are they trying  to sell in this commercial faster internet probably acting lessons no you know it is it's actually uh  they want you to they want you to i think grant your computer access to their website and then their 
[03:47:00]  website makes tweaks to your computer so basically you're paying for like uh just a simple registry  edits and stuff that you could do at yourself at home if you just took the 10 minutes to research  how to make your computer your computer faster some guy at some remote location can fuck with  your computer and and guarantee they put all kinds of spyware on there and and other shit probably but  uh yeah i think i have it queued up to where the kid goes mom oh yeah he's rules this game should be a  lot lot faster mom this internet connection is so slow i love they pan to an open closet door and his 
[03:47:30]  mother's sitting there with a throat slit and he said he's like yelling at the torso in her body  this internet collection is the connection is so slow and her pantyhose around her ankles  with a plunger sticking out of her pussy angry plane game boy  the computer's not even plugged in  just him with a fucking a fake cotton on a plane making zoom sounds  something that's been bothering me lately too is like there's a new uh stacker two commercial for 
[03:48:00]  six hour power and it's a regular commercial for one of those like you know energy shot drinks or  whatever but the very very end they tag this commercial with this guy he's obviously some  kind of bodybuilding like you know super guido looking guy right yeah and he holds the shot and  he's like he looks like he should be on wall street and he's got like the shirt and the time and he  he holds and he goes now i'm ready and it's so terrible and awful and it makes me laugh hysterically 
[03:48:30]  every time i watch it because nothing is that bad is this product called finally fast yeah finally  fast oh sonny sonny forelli everyone sonny hey hey sonny you know that commercial finally fast  commercial it's actually for a scent of software and i got hooked into it they actually you know they  actually have you do a scan on your computer and then they want you to buy their software to fix  the problems that it that they found and um i don't know i bought into it i sucked into it  it kind of worked a little bit but then they wanted me to buy four more other software programs 
[03:49:00]  for this that and the other crappy that's the whole that's the whole thing with any infomercial  whatever they're selling they just want to get you on the phone and then you you realize if you buy one  thing you're obligated to at least be shipped other stuff that you will then have to ship back  uh and pay shipping to them this inflated shipping price and that's how they get you like there's  that guy that goes buy my product you know the guy that has the the selling fucking how to work a 
[03:49:30]  computer ebay for fucking assholes things like that yeah he gets on there what you do is they they'll  keep sending you shit and you have to keep sending it back and there's no way to fucking stop them  from sending you the shit well the worst part about this is that when i downloaded that program right  they they they downloaded a whole bunch of uh spyware on my computer and i can't get the  fucking shit off now yeah that's usually what these things are big fucking spyware dump 
[03:50:00]  it's a big spyware dump yeah you deserve it though yeah for not doing the research yourself  yeah it would have taken you 15 minutes to figure out how to tweak your operating system  you would have been fucking better on my computer if you go to uh uh if you put in a lot of these  products that are online or on tv for infomercials into uh google you will come up with so many 
[03:50:30]  fucking complaints about how they're run uh how shitty their customer service is  and one of those is that that cd guy buy my product he he there are so many complaints for that  fucking company because they'll send you they go we'll send you free uh cds you just pay shipping  so they send you these free things and they're like half the program so then you have to get the  other half by buying it and then in order to send the shit back you got to pay shipping which is 
[03:51:00]  7.95 a disc there's something crazy like that they really get you and then they keep sending you  discs fucking scam and then you got to send them back at your expense the world is with scammers  it's the video professor video professor i couldn't think of the guy's name yeah video  professor okay do you remember the uh fucking columbia house oh yeah yeah i belong to them with  the dvds and i got so many weird ones wild west by will smith which i didn't want every 
[03:51:30]  everyone signed up for that like you send a penny and you taped a penny onto a little card you mailed it  and got your choice of like 15 uh uh cds i know someone that used their uh neighbor's address  oh and would make sure they uh you know got there before that neighbor oh you know someone  that i know is that someone a blonde-haired man in this room no i wouldn't do anything as 
[03:52:00]  illegal is that something is illegal but i know that shoots up on that yes tell you the truth it's  pretty uh pretty smart scam yeah because then this person never had to really uh buy the cds ever  well of course what are we talking about cassettes it was cassettes and then uh eight tracks yeah cds  albums and then the a track always cost a little more the cassette costs a little more right yeah  yeah wasn't that it it's a big album let's go to ship those things you used to come in a huge box  get 15 albums for a penny and this giant box which albums you know what like people will always 
[03:52:30]  complain about those columbia house things because you'd have to send them back but like  if you just did what like the commitment was it was actually way ahead of the game yeah it really  wasn't a bad deal at all but this person only had a paper out so you know savings for savings  rustling yes um if you can pause that finally fast commercial on the the screen with the word pad  there's like four storybook stories on there that are just so jacked up and twisted really 
[03:53:00]  yeah if you yeah if you can pause on there it's like what i hope that no one's really reading this  to their kids really fascinating you know where she's talking about sars and stuff like that  the hunchback had a tumor and stuff like that who knew all right we're trying to find it yeah we're  trying to find it i want to play that plane game that looks fun doesn't that look like so much fun  yeah you're flying and like colostomy bags are coming at you all right thank you it's called 
[03:53:30]  the shit windshield that's the name of the fucking game boy couldn't get shit windshield to work  speaking of these infomercials the paper and it was like on page two today they're having these  snuggies uh bar crawls they're taking over the world this snuggie is the fad of this uh well it's  to take off on the old toga party but instead of having togas it's uh people are wearing snuggies  and going out to bars and they're snuggies looking like a dude it's not funny they're gonna get 
[03:54:00]  gunk all over their feet you know it'd be a great thing once someone like the piece of someone's  snuggie gets caught in someone's car door and they're dragged to death because they can't get  out of their snuggie and their fucking skin is scraped off their genitals it's like a pile of  dickless meat in a snuggie then no one will do snuggie parties anymore the snuggie or until a gang  of snuggie wearing rapists attack a woman they all had a lot of snuggies and they raped me  they shoved a real afghan in my mouth so i couldn't yell help and ouch 
[03:54:30]  stupid snuggies and their dumb parties how bad do you need to interact with humans did anyone ever pay  for the columbia house things because it was just it was one of those things that you just didn't uh  uh well you never fulfilled your commitment and and a lot of times there was the thing of well  i'm not even 18 so you got to be 18 to sign a contract and they can't come after me i know  a person and meanwhile it's like they could totally come after your parents yeah it's your parents 
[03:55:00]  mailing address doesn't matter whose fucking name is on it do you know i know no you use the neighbor's  address this person was brilliant with this idea i know a guy that got arrested and actually spent a  night in jail for a columbia house record scheme shut the fuck up you're so full of  shit i'm not he's smiling ear to ear going no no this is uh named ted no no no oh you'd know  somebody who was it who was it i don't want to say it's a secret 
[03:55:30]  why is it a secret who want to know yeah we need to know i need to know donna wants to know  he got locked up yeah yeah for the columbia house thing but why say his name yeah it was fraud or  something fraud yeah i would think that would be a civil matter yeah not a criminal matter but so what  what happens sometimes you you think you may have something and uh you realize as your second foot 
[03:56:00]  is like exiting the cliff that you don't and so you fall  you plummet to your death oh we got a big crowd out there a bunch of studs hot  oh yeah that's all we got hot meat is that is that sexy ladies if i'm talking and i say to a girl  go ahead toot on my hot meat i don't think so that's right while they're suckling my weenie  i'm gonna fucking toot on my hot meat let's go to richard in texas yeah richard what's going on
