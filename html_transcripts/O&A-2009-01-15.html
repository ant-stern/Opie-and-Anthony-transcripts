<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts recounting a surprising encounter with Sir Paul McCartney the previous day.  The conversation quickly shifts to Sam, a show employee, whose increasingly provocative on-air antics – including giving a male co-worker, E-Rock, a hickey and engaging in other physical contact with several men – have landed him in trouble with his girlfriend and family. Sam admits to enjoying these acts and wanting to do more, leading to an explicit discussion of his actions and their humorous consequences, along with speculation about his sexuality.  Listener Manny then calls in to describe Anthony’s reckless driving on the Long Island Expressway (LIE).

The hosts segue into discussing Steve Jobs' medical leave, speculating on the severity of his health problems. This transitions into a discussion of Ricardo Montalbán's death, featuring anecdotes about his career and humorous commentary on his *Fantasy Island* role and the Chrysler Cordoba commercial.

The show then focuses heavily on the upcoming presidential inauguration of Barack Obama. The hosts express skepticism about the widespread excitement, voicing strong opinions and concerns about the racial implications and potential for societal dishonesty surrounding the election.  A caller recounts a negative experience with a Black woman on a bus, and the hosts engage in racially charged commentary, including an anecdote about someone claiming Black racial superiority based on melanin.  The discussion touches on the Abu Ghraib scandal and Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, with callers expressing their own concerns about Obama's policies and the perceived leniency of the justice system.  A caller explicitly states his belief that the excitement is solely due to Obama's race.  This segment includes tangents: jokes about baldness, a played clip of children singing pro-Obama songs (with Anthony criticizing their singing and the implied messianic portrayal of Obama), a clip of Archie Bunker discussing a Black president from *All in the Family*, and a discussion about Jeff Beck's lack of commercial success despite his place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Continuing the discussion about the Obama inauguration, the hosts and callers explore the perceived lack of satisfaction among some African Americans despite having a Black president. They discuss a former show friend's firing (initially falsely attributed to possessing child pornography), and Bruce Kelly's emotional response to seeing The Who perform.  The show devotes considerable time to the "We Are One" inauguration concert lineup, marked by numerous racist and sexist jokes about the performers.  A lengthy segment details a conflict between producers Sam Roberts and E-Rock, involving accusations of pressure to perform sexual acts and the revelation of E-Rock's previously undisclosed homosexuality. The hosts criticize Clint Eastwood's *Gran Torino* for its use of racial slurs, comparing it unfavorably to *All in the Family*.  Finally, they speculate about Steve's supposed "one-day cold" and his sweating.

The show then pivots to two main topics: Jeremy Piven's mercury poisoning and Anthony's road rage incident. The hosts humorously speculate about Piven's fish consumption and compare his situation to a similar experience of another actor (Mitter).  They discuss Piven's public service announcement urging heavy metal testing. Anthony recounts a detailed and angry account of a near-confrontation with a driver on the LIE, using highly offensive language. Callers share their own experiences with aggressive driving, leading to a broader discussion of bad driving habits.  Patty, a recurring caller, provides humorous commentary and impersonations. The segment concludes with a discussion and jokes about a video depicting inhumane treatment of animals in a slaughterhouse.

The final segment features Patty, a Starbucks employee, as the main focus. The discussion centers around her limited vacation time (seven hours), inadequate health benefits, and rigorous exercise regimen. Callers make jokes about her situation, and a calculation reveals she'd need 409 years to save $100,000 for retirement.  In a humorous, albeit uncomfortable, moment, the hosts offer Patty $20 to squeeze one of their penises through their pants, which she reluctantly does.  The conversation also touches upon her cell phone plan, library fines, and minimal 401k contributions. The hosts express amazement at Patty's life circumstances and the lack of change over the years.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Shoe.  Hi.  Man, what's going to happen today?  That's the beauty of this radio show. 
[00:00:30]  What is going to happen today?  Yesterday, we're minding our own business, doing our radio show, getting some lofts out there, some information.  Doing a little news.  Doing a little human interest.  We have Sam giving E-Rock a hickey.  Who saw that coming?  And then out of nowhere, we get a communique that Sir Paul McCartney will be on the Opie and Anthony Shoe.  I woke up yesterday. 
[00:01:00]  That was great.  Not knowing that I would end the radio show talking to a beetle.  No, that was a thrill.  Yeah.  One of those lifetime moments where you're just like, wow.  I never thought I'd talk to a beetle.  A lot of my email, too, is like, why didn't you warn us?  We didn't even know.  Oh.  We don't know what's going to happen today.  We have some ideas, but it could all change in a moment.  Oh.  A moment's notice.  Of course. 
[00:01:30]  But that was really, really cool.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We've talked about who would make you nervous over the years.  Yep.  Wow.  The nerves.  That's a biggie.  Flowing through the body yesterday.  Unprecedented.  And now we're just back to this.  Me, you, and Jimmy.  Hi, Jimmy.  Yuck.  Yesterday hanging with a beetle for a little while, and now it's just back to this.  We've got to get Sam in here. 
[00:02:00]  Sam.  He's in a bit of trouble with that hickey thing from yesterday.  Sam's always getting in trouble with our program.  Yeah.  Because Sam's been, boy, if you listen to early Sam on this program, he didn't do anything.  Dude.  He towed it around the video camera and giggled as everybody else went to the gallows.  But now, Sam is really getting involved in some of these more provocative little things  we get into. 
[00:02:30]  Well, we found something that he truly enjoys.  Yes.  Gay stuff.  Men.  Other men.  You're confusing me.  Because I look at you, I'm like, is he doing it for the radio?  Or is there something going on in his head and he found an outlet for it?  And how about, since that's the case, you let your chick go for like a straight guy.  Because she's very cute and everything.  And I think a straight guy would enjoy that instead of you just keeping her around as a  beard.  No.  And wasting her attractiveness on someone that doesn't appreciate it. 
[00:03:00]  You, a gay man.  You're saying this up all wrong.  I'm not gay.  Well, why don't you tell people what you've done in the last two days?  Okay.  Well.  Without editorializing, just tell the people.  Just the facts.  Just the facts, my friend.  Okay.  Yesterday, I gave Iraq a hickey.  Okay.  And then the day before that, I motorboated his chest, his breasts.  His man boobs.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  And also slapped him in his chest.  Right.  Right.  And belly.  And belly.  Yeah.  Slapped him in his belly.  All right.  Well, you rest our case.  Thanks, Sam.  All right.  Anyway, 877-212-1.  It's not that I'm not doing it for pleasure.  I just didn't like the reputation I was building for myself as somebody who said no.  So I started saying yes to things, but now I'm getting in trouble with my girlfriend and  family.  Oh, and family.  Yeah.  You know what?  There was a point where I think it was Jimmy started yelling and screaming at everybody 
[00:04:00]  around here.  Like, but someone's got to start doing something.  Yeah.  And Sam took that to heart.  Yeah.  But I.  Sam picked up the balls and ran with it.  But it was also yesterday, Bob Kelly was slapping me in the face and, you know, talking to me  like I was his prison prague.  Right.  Prison prague.  My girlfriend doesn't like that at all either.  So she heard that, but didn't hear the XM stuff. 
[00:04:30]  So I figured I just wouldn't say anything and kind of move on.  Which is very smart if you do the type of radio show we do.  Right.  When they ask questions like, ah, come on.  It's my job.  Yeah, it was for the radio.  Will you shut up?  But then we went to my parents' house for dinner last night.  Yeah.  And the first thing, I got in the door and my mom said hello.  And she goes, Sam, when you were giving E-Rock that hickey today, it was just disgusting.  So she sold you out.  And Jess goes, what?  What?  My mom was like, oh, sorry. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, you didn't tell her about your other life?  Yeah.  She was, her only solace was that I didn't have a hickey on me.  Right.  Well, here's the question.  Does E-Rock have a hickey on him?  I don't know.  Oh.  Where is the E-Rock?  I put the picture up on onaradio.com.  Sam, no work is being done.  Oh.  Did you have to lie to your girl and tell her you didn't like it?  I want to kiss more guys.  Oh, all right, Sam.  All right.  We did it.  The mouth may lie, but the front of your pants tells the truth. 
[00:05:30]  Doesn't it, Sam?  I kissed, okay, three guys.  Three.  Three.  All right.  That's not bad.  I had done that.  You've kissed three guys.  For the show.  I want to kiss more guys.  I do not.  Wait, name the three times you kissed a guy.  Okay, well, I kissed a homeless man in the street.  Why would you do that?  They're dirty people.  Because there was a television pilot being filmed that I'm pretty sure any day is going 
[00:06:00]  to get picked up, right?  Right, guys?  There's still a chance.  You gave it your all for the TV pilot.  Those bastards didn't even acknowledge we made that.  No.  How great is that?  How great is it that they don't even acknowledge that we actually tried to give them a TV show?  And then technically...  I mean, in this business...  Oh, please.  Then technically, Bob Kelly kissed me.  It wasn't me kissing him.  Uh-huh.  Because he grabbed my face.  And then I also...  The mutual thing. 
[00:06:30]  But you did have a look of want on your face.  No.  He was doing that.  It was disgust.  Let's not forget Creepy Gay Kid that was sweeping the nation for about a day.  Yeah, well...  You can look that up on YouTube.  Yeah.  I'm looking at the video of you as Creepy Gay Kid.  It's just terrific.  For Bob Kelly.  I shouldn't have done that either.  He's got a lot of regrets.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Look at Creepy Gay Kid.  I shouldn't have done that.  He's dancing around without his shirt on with sunglasses and giving Bob Kelly what amounts 
[00:07:00]  to a lap dance.  The best part of Sam's body that doesn't even have a hint of a muscle.  Is the...  Is just the tattoo that is awkwardly on his shoulder.  I never saw that.  What is your tattoo of?  It's a white zombie logo and then Rob Zombie signed it and then I got that tattooed on.  That's cool.  Man, that's wonderful.  You've got great little hips.  Thank you.  Birthing hips.  Thank you.  Birthing hips.  And then the third guy was interned David.  Right.  Oh, well, of course, yeah.  It's not gay because it's more awkward for them. 
[00:07:30]  Mm-hmm.  Well, of course it is.  Yeah, yeah, you're fine.  Doing it to make them uncomfortable.  So what happened with you and your lovely woman after she found out because your mom  let the secret out?  She was just exasperated.  She just...  She had this look and tone in her voice that she just doesn't know what to do with me anymore.  Leave you?  Well, she...  I think.  She doesn't want to leave me, but she doesn't understand why three times a week I'm coming  home.  Yeah, I did this today.  It's not a big deal.  Don't worry about it.  She's like, well, it is a big deal because it keeps happening. 
[00:08:00]  Like, it's...  If you just did it once and it was just for the show, it's fine.  But you just keep doing these things.  It's habitual.  Are you on the down low?  No.  No.  She's like, it is a big deal because it keeps on happening.  Yeah.  That's going to make me laugh all day.  But this show is building a terrible reputation for me.  Yeah.  Nice.  I didn't see that guy. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, we'll talk to him in a second.  Now, E-Rock, let me see the hickey.  All right.  See, if he doesn't have a hickey, then you're in the clear.  Oh, but that's a hickey, Sam.  But it's on his belly.  Oh.  Well, it's close to his boob.  We said belly, and for some reason, you decided to get as close to his boob as possible.  You told me boob.  Hold on a minute.  Everyone's distracted by Manny.  Manny, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Good morning.  It's the ADD radio show.  We're in the middle of something, but we've got to go to you. 
[00:09:00]  Go ahead, Manny.  All right.  So I do a paper route over in Great Neck.  Yeah.  And I'm on my way home this morning.  I get on the LIE.  And as I get on the LIE, there's a truck and a left wing comes flying up next to me,  cuts me off, and keeps going.  I look at it, and it's a black escalator.  I'm like, wait a second.  So I miss my exit.  I'm trying to just to catch up to this guy, because I had to see.  And I get next to him.  I look over, and there's Anthony driving.  Yo, man, you must be going 110 miles an hour.  You just need to slow down a little bit. 
[00:09:30]  Get out of the way.  110, and it's snowing a little bit in New York City.  Ah, I wasn't doing it.  The roads were dry.  The people are in the way.  Oh, don't you hate that, though?  They're all in the way this morning.  I had to go.  I had to hit the right lane for so long and speed down the right lane in order to get past  people that were just chugging in the left.  Yeah, I always wonder if people see me.  And I know, I think yesterday or the day before, there was another guy with WOW stickers on his  vehicle and everything, and I blew past him. 
[00:10:00]  And I always wonder if they kind of seeing and wonder if seeing this Escalade going at  100 miles an hour is me.  Well, it's a good bet it's you at 5 in the morning.  Yeah, that's true.  You told everyone you're driving Escalade, so there's a lot of Escalades during the day  you see, but at 5 in the morning, odds are, you know.  Especially if it's, yeah, blurry.  There you go.  If you only see a blur shoot past you.  Well, I'm sorry if I cut you off.  Were you, were you, uh...  No, dude, it's all good.  I just wanted to let you guys know, you blew past me this morning, and I just wanted to 
[00:10:30]  call and say, uh, thank you for not killing me.  You're welcome.  But, uh, have a great morning, guys.  Thank you so much, uh, checking out.  All right, man.  Thank you.  I have to get here.  I hold an important position.  There you go.  So, you're right.  You've got the hickey.  Sam's in trouble with his girl.  Yes.  Sam.  Looks like everything is, uh, quite normal with the Open Anthony show.  Hunky Dory.  Yeah.  I just don't know how to gracefully retire from this Sam the Gay Guy character that's  being built.  Character.  We didn't build nothing. 
[00:11:00]  The character you're talking about.  You just decided to, you know, take your character in that direction, my friend.  Just stop.  You could have said, see, and you're saying you want to kiss more guys.  Yep.  You could have said no any, any time you wanted.  Yeah, but I don't want to say no.  Just stop asking me to do things.  Maybe we're testing you.  I'm like, oh my God, this guy will do anything.  It's kind of creepy.  Sam, you want to give E-Rock a...  All right.  I'm like, but Sam, we can't.  That's against the FCC.  Yeah, isn't that the opposite, too?  Because your mom was happy that you didn't come back with a hickey on you. 
[00:11:30]  No, my girlfriend was.  Oh, your girlfriend.  Okay.  Was happy that you didn't have the hickey on you.  Right.  And that you gave E-Rock the hickey.  But if it was, like, real serious where, you know, man-on-man sex sometimes goes, I believe  she would be happy if it was the other way around and E-Rock was taking care of you.  Hmm.  That's an interesting...  I love you, Matt, Kelly.  Well, why don't we try it?  No, no, no.  You know what? 
[00:12:00]  That would probably balance things out in her mind.  Sure.  And she would feel like, my boy is not a bottom all the time.  My boy tops as well.  I think you're right, Anthony.  Yeah.  No.  Because you can justify in your head, like, you know, I wanted one.  I didn't want to give one.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  I worked with somebody else.  Well, yeah.  Who might own a fine restaurant.  And no, it's not me.  That's one of my favorite stories of all time.  I think he doesn't want us playing it anymore. 
[00:12:30]  She said...  He's never officially said that, but he's always like, oh, you're killing me with that story  replay.  Yes, Sam.  She said the fact...  I asked her if it makes her question things.  And she said, no, the fact that it was E-Rock doesn't make me question things.  I just find it very disgusting.  Ah.  Because it's E-Rock.  Right.  She's just completely grossed out.  Really?  Yeah.  I just want to point out that you didn't do anything for this radio show, and it all started  with you eating some meat.  Hmm?  It all started with you eating some meat. 
[00:13:00]  Oh.  And it has progressed to giving E-Rock hickeys pretty close to his boobs.  He was fed meat.  You were fed meat.  Another man put meat in his mouth is what happened.  It wasn't.  Thank you for getting where I was going with this.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Another man gave you meat.  It wasn't just any man.  Mick Foley gave me meat.  Mick Foley.  Right.  Yeah.  He fed me meat.  Mick Foley put meat in your mouth.  But I'd never had meat before.  Well.  Well, you know.  It'll start somewhere. 
[00:13:30]  First time.  And I didn't like it.  Was your mouth filled with meat?  Well, if you remember, I was gagging.  Yes, you were.  Yes.  He doesn't like meat.  You weren't a fan of the meat at first.  Mick Foley did give you a mouth full of meat.  And he kind of just kept putting meat in your mouth.  And you took it.  I like that.  Oh, I didn't like it.  Did you swallow it?  I don't remember.  Or did you spit it out?  No.  I mean, it was my first time.  I spit it out.  Did you?  Yeah.  Because I remember you really didn't like it.  No, I did not like it.  It's terrible.  It was too much.  A lot of people writing in caps this morning on Instant Feedback. 
[00:14:00]  And basically just saying, no more gay stuff, please.  Yes.  In caps.  I think that's Jess.  You felt.  Probably.  Probably.  And you felt that Iraq giving Sam one would probably balance things out and make Jess happy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because then it's like, you know, reciprocation.  Iraq, does your girl have any problems with the man-on-man motorboat and the man-on-man hickey? 
[00:14:30]  I never told her.  Why would that mic work?  And don't look at me.  Everything is down.  Iraq never told her, I'm sure.  Because you know my favorite story.  Maybe.  You remember like three weeks ago, Iraq and me had an experience with a tranny blow-up doll?  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Thanks for reminding us of another gay thing you did for the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, that one was so awful that I just told Jess about it right away because, you know, better.  Yeah.  But Iraq's fiance calls up Jess maybe last week and says, did you hear what our boyfriends did with that blow-up doll? 
[00:15:00]  Jess was like, yeah, that was weeks ago.  You know, in some cultures, you guys are pretty much dating.  Yeah.  You know that, right?  We are.  Not in this culture.  You've got a very close girlfriend.  My boyfriend, he's engaged, but you guys got a little something-something on the side.  It's brilliant because it's in the open for everybody.  You're getting away with murder.  It's amazing.  No, it's not.  Beards.  Right.  You guys are like the opposite of what happens. 
[00:15:30]  You know when you're out, maybe you're out with your girlfriend and a friend and his girlfriend,  and the girls are close, and they hang out and put their arms around each other, maybe give  each other a little kiss and play with their hair.  That's what you guys are, but only the opposite.  Like, it's you and E-Rock that are doing those girly things with each other, and your significant  other is a kind of a little suspect.  It has to be stopped.  It's, hey, there's only one person that can stop it. 
[00:16:00]  Your girlfriend's complaining about it?  Yes.  There's only one person that can stop it.  It's yourself.  So, good luck to you.  Hopefully, you'll find the strength, though.  I hear like you're born with it, and it's not really something that you fall into in  life, so you just got to accept it, I think.  I meant the actions.  I'm not gay.  Some people say you're born with it.  Some people say you go that direction because of circumstances.  Like, maybe this is considered kind of a prison.  I had to justify it because my dad was also very disappointed, but then I reminded my dad. 
[00:16:30]  Well, let's be honest.  You're disappointed with him and his handlebar mustache, so now you're even.  Well, I reminded my dad that he was in a fraternity and asked him what he did that he never told  me and reminded him he was doing it to impress a bunch of guys.  At least I had a mic in front of me.  Yeah.  Did you show him this picture that Danny found?  No, I didn't show him that picture.  Why would I?  You can't even describe that picture.  Sam, that's really gay.  That is every gay video you could pop up, a freeze frame from it. 
[00:17:00]  It is pretty much our own Sam, and he is simulating doing something to a transvestite blow-up doll.  He is simulating a sex act where he wouldn't be able to whistle a tune at the same time.  He shouldn't have done that either.  Sam, you sure don't have a secret.  Man, we don't have to play this one out.  Look at that technique. 
[00:17:30]  We just go with it on the radio.  His cheeks are all sucking.  He's got that old...  Wow, you're good.  You know, luckily, I was able to snap ten photos of Sam and Eric's...  Ten photos.  Oh, yeah, they're great.  Well, just for the people, E-Rock decided to put something in his pants, and it's through the zipper.  Yeah, it was the detachable piece of the transvestite doll.  Sam did what he does best, I guess.  And then Travis took ten pictures of it on his phone, because he needed material for later, I guess. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Sam took to it like a fly to sugar.  That picture, that picture that I'm looking at can be taken and put on any gay porno site, and no one would question it.  It wouldn't be like, oh, that's fake.  Dude, a little Photoshop and you're in deep trouble, man.  Did they get rid of the plastic-looking thing?  Yeah, oh, that would be so easy to do.  You could, like, make that look real.  Can you just cut down on the highlight a little bit? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, you just paint it up a little bit.  Well, I don't have any other options for a career at this point.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, neither do male prostitutes, I guess.  Well, that's not what I intended to be.  Oh.  So, why weren't you in the movie, Milk?  You were perfect for it.  I'm not.  You could have been one of the extras, hanging out in the camera store.  Mmm.  I'm not gay.  I've been thrown into this.  No one was asking you.  Peer-pressured.  We got a nice supply of gay listeners, I'm sure. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  What does that have to do with anything?  Nothing wrong with it.  We're open-minded to the gay, so don't worry about it.  I'm not worried, but it doesn't apply to me.  Your girl's getting a little nervous.  Yeah, she's not happy.  Yeah, what's up, Iraq?  Well, somebody just found out.  What?  Wait, your fiancé didn't know?  I haven't told her anything.  She just found out.  I'm not allowed to hang out with Sam anymore.  Wait, you didn't tell her about the motorboat to your man boobs? 
[00:19:30]  No.  Or the hickey that's very obvious on your chest?  No.  But your weight?  He just keeps setting up mirrors differently around the house, positioning himself.  Fun house mirrors.  All right, we got a developing story here.  Very good.  Thank you.  877-212-ON-A.  So yesterday was Paul McCartney.  We'll find out what it is today.  It's always something.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony.  Da.  Da.  Da. 
[00:20:00]  Some kind of art music.  There we go.  There it is.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Boy, it looks like Steve Jobs is in trouble.  Uh, don't look so good.  Wow.  Yeah.  CEO of Apple, right?  Yes.  He's taking a leave of absence until June.  Eh.  Eh.  Yes.  It's been a lot of speculation because he's lost a lot of weight.  He had some kind of, what, tumor on his pancreas? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  They thought they had that under control, and then they said, what, some kind of hormone  thing was making him lose a lot of weight?  They said he had a hormone imbalance.  Yeah.  And he had a tiny tumor on the pancreas.  So they thought they could just get that off.  But, uh, this is not a good sign.  Why is the pancreas the evil organ?  You don't want anything to happen to the pancreas ever.  Yeah.  You certainly want that one to be functioning, don't you?  You get a little something going on with your liver or your kidney. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  You still got a lot of time, a lot of options.  But, man, you see anything on that pancreas.  Oh.  They said his wasn't the deadly version.  But, to me, it's like, all the speculation around him, like, and the stock has dropped  because, like, is he sick?  He's like, no, I'm fine.  Right.  And then he's like, I know I've got to take time off.  It's like a little more complex.  That's bad news, man.  His weight is mirroring the stock price.  I believe he's at 75 pounds.  He dropped 10% yesterday. 
[00:21:30]  And what was the pounds a year ago?  149?  192.  192.  So it's on to something.  I do believe the stock price is mirroring.  I don't think they're going to tell you what's wrong with a guy.  A guy that is this powerful, you're never going to get the real story.  No.  They're going to hide as much as they can, of course.  Too many people depend on him.  Yeah, but the thing is, if you're going to go, and, you know, I hate to even say it about  somebody, but, you know, CEOs and bigwigs in companies, they do go. 
[00:22:00]  But the companies, it's going to go on.  And he's like the cheerleader, the rah-rah, the face to the company, the guy that goes  up in the big products that come out and shows them off.  It's not like Apple's going to collapse if this guy's not part of it.  It would certainly hurt him for a little while until they get a new figurehead in there.  Hopefully a healthier one.  I see good buying opportunity.  Do you think that the way it really does mirror, like, he's up to 120, buy, buy, buy. 
[00:22:30]  He's got neck fat again, buy.  That's sad, though, man.  It's like when you see a guy 55 years old, that much money, and it's like.  He's got the world by the balls.  Everything.  It's like the phone that works.  But, I mean, aside from that, he's got everything.  He's a brilliant guy.  He's a head of a great company.  Yeah.  Is it worth playing the audio?  Well, we can start with this clip.  But he's taking that leave of absence.  That's never good.  No.  Saying he'll come back in June, huh?  No. 
[00:23:00]  The Apple founder, Steve Jobs, announcing he's going out on a medical leave, saying the health  problem he revealed only a few days ago, in his words, is, quote, more complex than originally  thought.  Hi, Wolf.  This is really an extraordinary.  So you really got to translate these quotes.  More complex than he thought.  What does that mean?  The cancer's back.  He got a holy S phone call from the doctor.  Like, what is it?  So speculating, doesn't that sound like chemo?  Like, doesn't that sound like it's back, and this is how much time it's going to take 
[00:23:30]  for you to go through another round?  And they say, you know, it's more complex than originally thought.  He said hormone imbalance.  But then, yeah, it might be, you know, might have reared its ugly head again.  Wolf, this is really an extraordinary and unanticipated development.  After all, as you alluded to, just a few days ago, Steve Jobs tried to dismiss speculation  that his health was declining rapidly.  There had been a lot of speculation in Silicon Valley that he was in dire health, and he  put out a statement saying that his weight loss, and we have a picture showing his weight 
[00:24:00]  loss over the last couple of years, how dramatic it is.  His statement said that his weight loss was attributed to a hormone deficiency and basically  said that was it.  You got to remember, Jobs had pancreatic cancer in 2004, had part of his pancreas removed.  And so his health has always been a fragile issue among Apple faithful and Apple investors.  Yikes.  Well, good luck, bro. 
[00:24:30]  Good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  And no, Danny, I didn't mean it's a goodbye opportunity.  I meant a goodbye opportunity, not goodbye.  Just wish him well.  No, wish him well.  Goodbye.  Oh, I thought you meant good B.I.  Like, he's weak now, you can have a homosexual experience with him.  No!  Wow. 
[00:25:00]  Money's not everything, huh?  Money can't cure everything.  Money can't buy you love, as a guest that we had yesterday once said.  Can't get rid of tumors, either.  Yes.  I think this ends horribly.  I think this is it.  I'm not my little guest.  Now, Kreskin.  What do I know?  What do I know, bud?  And you drop 70% of your weight.  Yeah, man.  What is he down to?  Nine.  This ends chin first on a keyboard.  On his computer screen, they're going to walk in and just find, he said, 
[00:25:30]  like, dear, and the R's going to be like, feeling all the way through.  All the way through.  All the way down the page.  Do you know what AOL had that was really interesting yesterday?  When you sign on, they had these weird little trivia things.  We're two days ago.  Famous last words.  We had all these cool quotes, like the last thing people said.  It was really great and creepy at the same time.  You got any we could do on the show?  They could pull them up.  I honestly don't know.  Man, I gave up on that AOL years ago. 
[00:26:00]  Years ago.  I stopped paying for it.  I'm eating banana.  Yeah, I see that.  Well, now you get it for free?  My email address, yeah.  Huh.  They do it for free now?  That's what someone told me, right?  Yeah, well, yeah, well.  I had an easy time canceling.  I was paying $25 a month.  And I'm like, this is going to be a nightmare.  So the guy's like, maybe I could offer you.  I'm like, I'm not sure what you're not understanding.  Yeah.  I'm like, I know you're doing your job, but I do not want the service. 
[00:26:30]  I got his name.  He was like, okay.  And he canceled it.  He was okay.  Really?  Yeah.  You know why?  Because they caught so much crap for giving people a hard time canceling.  You know, it was AOL, I always thought it was training wheels for the internet.  But when you first got on, it was like an easy way to get online and, you know, the dial-up  thing.  Well, no one knew how to do it before then.  How to even get online and then just open a browser.  You kind of forget. 
[00:27:00]  It's like, what?  You got to get on?  I need AOL to, like, get the...  You pretty much did, though.  Yeah.  You forget, but, you know.  They kind of had that monopolized.  Some of the tech guys knew how to get around the AOL to get online, but not many of us.  Hey, so they're talking about jobs today, and they're also talking about Khan today.  Oh, Ricardo Montalban.  Ricardo Montalban is being remembered today. 
[00:27:30]  He died at the age of...  Oh, you said that perfectly.  Ricardo Montalban.  So you get that L in there.  I've never got...  Yes.  I always used to say Ricardo Montalban.  I said the L at the wrong place.  Montalban or something.  No, Montalban.  You nailed it.  Ricardo Montalban is being remembered today.  He died at the age of 88.  He appeared in more than 80 movies and television shows,  and was most famous for his role as Mr. Rourke on Fantasy Island.  He was about promoting expression of the soul through art, 
[00:28:00]  and he had no barriers.  What he had was a wonderful accent that spoke to an entire world.  Oh, boy.  The Emmy Award winner and screen actors...  Who was that?  Who was that?  Who was that?  Who was the lady?  How about you let us know who that was?  Was that his wife or something?  I don't know who that was.  I think it was...  I think it was one of the women that works at his theater.  He founded a theater in Hollywood.  I think it was one of the people that work at the theater.  Couldn't have been his wife. 
[00:28:30]  I believe she died on SETI Alpha 5.  I do believe that's what happened when they were stranded there,  when the Botany Bay...  Botany Bay?  Botany Bay.  Oh, Captain.  They put creatures in our bodies.  Ugh.  Where they put them?  Sam wants to know.  Poor Sam.  Award winner and screen actors guild Lifetime Achievement recipient 
[00:29:00]  acted well into his 80s,  founding the Ricardo Montalban Theater ten years ago  to give the next generation of actors their chance.  Hollywood and Vine.  What a wonderful place for him to call  the Ricardo Montalban Theater.  And he broadly broadcasts Mi Casa Es Tu Casa.  That's what it's all about.  It's kind of hard today.  This statement from Leonard Nimoy,  he says,  I greatly admired him.  He was a confident artist and a gentleman. 
[00:29:30]  A gentleman?  The guy opened fire on the Enterprise  and Spock had a run down to the reactor room.  It's the fault that he died.  In the first place,  why would he then give him kudos like that?  That wasn't real.  He tasked me.  He tasked me.  And I shall have him.  Best Star Trek ever.  In my humble opinion.  The first movie?  It was the most human.  It's one where Kirk gets a little teary-eyed 
[00:30:00]  when they're sending Spock off in the sunglasses case.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  We really should have the con drop  if we were producing this show properly.  Gone!  But why would we have a con drop, right, Steve?  That's stupid.  Do we have any Fantasy Island stuff?  Why would we, Jimmy?  Kirk, my old friend.  Yes!  It's not like he was known for that show.  Oh.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do. 
[00:30:30]  Oh.  Where that little,  where that little, uh,  that little too many drinks in the womb thing  would run up the steps and ring the bell.  And then,  and then tranny-loving Mr. Rourke  would pop out.  Yeah.  I'm your host.  White suit, red spot in the front.  I should have asked her  certain questions first.  Ah, yeah.  Come smiles, everyone.  Smiles.  Smiles.  And then the plane would come.  He said he was very upset with,  uh, people, uh,  that would just say 
[00:31:00]  the plane's the plane to him.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, he said, uh,  on a Larry King interview in the 90s,  that it's like, you know,  people think they're the first people  that say it.  Well, you know what?  I guess he got a little upset about that.  You know what?  Deal with it.  I, I, I,  I bet you he wasn't that upset about that  when he was hanging around  in his multi-million dollar mansion.  Shut up.  Exactly.  He did a lousy show  dressed like Pablo Escobar.  Shut up.  Anybody knows your name.  Right.  That show was huge  and did well for you.  Deal with the plane  for a few decades.  Also, uh, very famous,  uh, back in the, uh, 
[00:31:30]  late, uh, mid-late 70s,  I guess,  for the Chrysler Cordoba.  Mm-hmm.  With the rich Corinthian leather.  He would be pushing that leather  on the seats.  Well, the guys gave us  one out of three,  so that's good.  Oh, yeah?  Stump Brain, what's going on?  I think I gotta yell at you today.  Why not the con drop?  Why not the, uh,  the, uh,  the, uh,  Fantasy Island stuff?  Gone.  You gotta beat these guys up  behind the scenes.  Gone.  You're going to have  to come down here.  That's the grave digger talking.  Oh, the Rathacon people 
[00:32:00]  are screaming.  This guy's a panic.  Oh, boy.  The beauty of this show,  they'll run, uh,  the con clip  and the Fantasy Island clip in  just in time  after the break  when we decide  to move on from this.  Sure.  And we wonder  why everything's  falling apart.  Can't even do the basics.  Here's the commercial  you're, uh,  talking about,  though, Anthony.  I know my own needs.  And what I need  from an automobile,  I know I get  from this new  Cordova. 
[00:32:30]  They still have  Cordovas out there?  No.  Oh, okay.  What's it,  made in Mexico?  The Cordova.  There's little kids  trying to sell you  chicklets in it.  Chicklet!  Chicklet!  Little bastards  get away from me.  And the Corinthian leather  doesn't exist.  Isn't that something  that they made up?  I think,  why am I screaming?  I think that  Corinthian leather  was something,  I could be wrong,  but I think that was  a made up thing.  Really?  It sounded good,  yeah.  It just sounded  Corinthian. 
[00:33:00]  He could roll his R's  on the Corinthian leather.  I could ask for more  than the quality  of Cordova's  workmanship,  the tastefulness  of its appearance.  I request nothing  beyond the thickly  cushioned luxury  of seats available  even in soft  Corinthian leather.  Yet,  it is on the highway  where Cordova  best answers  my demands.  What's your demand?  A piece of crap car  that goes slow?  in this small Chrysler 
[00:33:30]  than great comfort  at a most pleasant price.  I have great confidence  for which there can be  no price.  In Cordova,  I have what I need.  I don't think I've ever  seen one of these  on the road.  Were people buying them?  Oh yeah,  they used to buy them.  Yeah.  That was in the day  of the old rust bucket though.  You know,  five years after you  owned a car,  it was just rusted.  You don't see that anymore.  That's like something  you really don't see. 
[00:34:00]  The rusted out car.  Remember,  you would buy a car  and then you would ask  where this car  would,  you know,  came from?  Yeah.  Oh,  it came from,  you know,  the northeast.  That's bad.  Oh,  that's a lot of salt  on the road.  A lot of salt.  That's going to wear out  the bottom of this car.  Got to go to Arizona  and buy your car.  Nice and dry.  Someone in my family,  if you need a car,  trust me,  go to Florida.  Go to Arizona.  Somewhere dry.  Florida,  you get that salt sea air.  No,  that don't work either.  You got to be somewhere inland.  Right. 
[00:34:30]  I buy my cars  from Wyoming,  but only southern Wyoming.  I was a big fan  of buying my cars  from Seattle.  Yeah.  See,  that's a rain joke,  people.  Rains all the time there.  Rust buckets.  I would imagine  your car would last  maybe a season.  I guess people  started getting  that true coat.  Yeah,  they figured that out,  thank God.  Yeah.  This is coming in a lot,  Anthony.  They're hers.  They're hers.  Oh.  And Stephen S.  from Bayshore,  Ricardo's skin  will be looking like  genuine Corinthian leather 
[00:35:00]  within six months.  Oh.  There's an old  Klingon proverb.  It is very cold  in the grave.  I guess God  needed a Klingon.  Oh.  Well,  he was just  a superior race.  He wasn't a Klingon.  He was a product  of late 20th century  genetic engineering.  Where they,  actually in 1990,  they put them  in a intergalactic  spaceship  and shipped them off  into like exile.  And that's when 
[00:35:30]  the Enterprise  had found them  in some kind  of suspended animation,  fought them out,  and then Khan  just kind of took over.  Kirk was so stupid  in that one.  This is the original one,  not the motion picture.  This was the episode  that got the movie made.  The original episode.  There was an original  Star Trek episode  made in the 60s  that starred  Ricardo Montalban  as Khan.  Oh,  he was in,  I didn't know that.  And it was a sequel.  Actually,  the movie was a sequel  to that episode.  And the dumbest thing,  here's Khan.  I don't care. 
[00:36:00]  No.  No.  No.  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care.  It's a popular program.  People love it.  No,  because it was a,  they found him  floating in space.  People care.  It's Star Trek.  Thousands attend  conventions.  I'm happy.  No.  Women call me  quack,  quack,  quacky.  I don't care.  Shut up,  Kevin Meany.  I don't care.  No.  They care.  I don't care. 
[00:36:30]  Oh.  Stupid Kevin Meany  and his stupid  I don't care song.  So I wasn't accurate  with God Needs a Klingon,  so God Needs a what?  Because every time  one of these people dies.  A late 20th century  genetically engineered Superman.  That's what God needed?  Yes.  That's the best we can do  with this one?  Yes.  Usually it's a perfect  little bit we do.  Kirk actually let Khan  review all of the ship's tapes  of all the engineering. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  He goes,  I need some reading material.  Yeah.  What do you have?  Do you have specs  on the Enterprise?  And Kirk is like,  sure.  And he gives him  all he wants.  He's like,  you don't do that  with some guy  you just...  Ah, Kirk was  a horrid captain.  Should have told him  that when we interviewed him.  But...  What?  There are no crickets  in space.  Explain it to them.  Khan!  Khan! 
[00:37:30]  Yes.  That's when he was  stranded inside a regular  with the Genesis device.  and of course  Khan wanted  the Genesis device.  Which he got...  Wait, no!  Because he got it  because Chekhov  blabbed about it  because he put  a creature in his ear  which made him  very susceptible  to suggestion.  And Khan got  the Genesis device  but his thirst  for vengeance 
[00:38:00]  much like  Moby Dick's  the story  and Moby Dick.  Uh, uh...  I don't care!  He was obsessed  with Admiral Kirk.  Admiral Kirk!  No!  You care!  This is...  People care!  I don't care!  No!  One more time!  No!  See, this is what happened.  Wah, wah, wah.  I'm going to try  to move on  to other things  but Stephen S.  from Bayshore. 
[00:38:30]  Yes.  Because every time  someone famous dies  or someone of significance  dies  you got to go  with the whole...  Get his wings?  You got to go  with the whole  I guess God needed  a blank.  Yes.  And he might  have the one  for Ricardo Montalblan.  Montalblan.  We got to get that L  in there.  Montalblan.  No, it's  Ricardo Montalblan.  Yeah, Montalblan.  The L is before the B.  I had an extra L.  Montalblan.  Montalblan.  Uh, Stephen S. 
[00:39:00]  from Bayshore.  I guess God needed  a Spaniard  who enjoyed  enslaving kickables.  Poor little tattoo.  Uh, by the way.  Yes?  Somebody had  an acting audition  yesterday.  And how did it go, Jimmy?  Eh.  You know what?  What?  Eh.  What do you mean eh?  You might get it.  What is it for?  It was for a movie  that Meryl Streep  has been cast in.  Nice.  And, uh...  Meryl Streep?  Yes. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  And, uh...  To say I bombed.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What do you mean  you bombed?  Um, I don't know  if you can...  If you've ever seen  something blown  the way I blew  this audition.  Oh, no.  No.  I...  stunk... 
[00:40:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  I didn't really  like the material,  but I...  It was to play  a hotel doctor.  What?  Like a hotel doctor.  They have those?  I guess so.  All right.  Well, not in this movie.  If I was the only one  auditioning,  they don't...  I think I got  the character written out.  You're playing it  like Groucho Marx.  I'm the hotel doctor.  That would have  been an improvement  over my face  in the page. 
[00:40:30]  It was so bad.  The woman called me in.  She was a young girl.  Maybe like late 20s or something.  And she sat me down  and we're going through it  and I'm bombing so badly.  Like, I'm doing so terribly  on this.  And I'm like,  I can't act.  I'm singing this  in my head  as we're doing this audition.  That's a real confidence booster  when in your head  you're saying,  I can't act.  You know,  that doesn't come out  in your reading  and in your mannerisms  and people don't 
[00:41:00]  really pick up  on that lack of confidence  when you're saying  that in your head.  Dude, I got halfway through it  and I tripped on one of the words.  Like, maybe your wife can...  And I'm like,  can we start over?  Oh.  Sometimes you've got to stop.  And she goes,  okay.  And then she goes,  well, let's start from this point.  It was like two lines back.  I was doing so bad  she didn't even want to go back  a page.  Don't start over.  She goes,  let's start back here.  Two lines back.  She goes,  I'm a wizard  piecing these things together.  And I wanted to go,  do you think you idiot,  I'm 19 years into this, 
[00:41:30]  that I think the afterwards,  you're going to splice it together?  Shut up.  They wanted you out of there so bad.  Dude.  They wanted to say next so bad.  But I couldn't even get mad at her  because I was so awful.  Like,  why would she waste  another moment of her time?  Why do you think you were bad?  I don't know.  I didn't like the material.  Yeah.  I'm not saying it sucked.  It's just not right for me.  I'm not a hotel.  The other guys I was reading against  were,  they looked like hotel doctors.  I looked like,  I don't know.  I just,  and I didn't enjoy what I was reading. 
[00:42:00]  You looked like the reason  they need a hotel doctor.  Or something like that.  I wasn't going to go that direction.  Bleeding from,  well,  send the doctor in.  Exactly.  They walk in,  I have a smile and flesh  between my teeth.  Can I play that guy?  It was horrendous.  I was like,  it was,  I forgot how bad it can be  when you are not comfortable  reading something.  They're not casting you,  right?  Well,  that was,  I told my manager,  I'm like,  John,  you can't send me for this stuff.  Yeah,  you should slap him in the face.  No,  no,  he goes,  you know what?  He goes,  you're right.  He goes,  that one probably was not for you. 
[00:42:30]  He goes,  they kind of requested you  because they like you.  Nice.  Meryl Streep was,  it's like,  how do you say no?  It's just a matter of time  before you get a nice little part  in a movie,  Jimmy.  Like a real part.  If I do,  I do,  but I'm 40 years old.  Maybe I'll do something,  but they're not going to just  start handing me movies.  I'm beyond that.  For me,  stand-up is my root,  maybe a show or something.  I'm dreading turning 40,  man.  Yeah,  it's pretty bad.  I mean,  you know.  Wow.  It's the Benjamin Buttons  and Anthony show.  877-212-0&A. 
[00:43:00]  Phones are kind of dead right now,  but we'll get to you in a minute or two.  Well,  I think,  you know,  a little Star Trek talk,  they'd probably light right up.  No,  no,  let's stay away from that  for a little while,  please.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Let them eat static. 
[00:43:30]  Well,  we do have your video  you requested for today.  Well,  I'm just...  You,  I'm not a racist.  I just point things out.  There is opposite racism going on  in this country right now.  That's the angle we're taking today.  The pendulum is swinging back  the other way.  No,  I'm just really,  I've gotten so tired  of this upcoming inauguration  and the news  and all the channels 
[00:44:00]  doing this big,  big hoopla thing  and,  oh,  and just the graphics  and the music  and everything.  It's like,  all right,  shut up already.  But it's exciting.  Just swear the guy in.  It takes a minute  for him to be sworn in  and there's going to be  all this hoopla  and hip-hop people  and crap  that I don't want to see.  And,  and,  and the goddamn  liberals  were giving George W.,  who,  you know,  is an ass,  but giving him  all kinds of crap  about the expense 
[00:44:30]  of his last inauguration  and the expense  and the pomp  and circumstance  that was going on  during a time  where perhaps  more should have been,  people should have been  concentrating more  on the war  and things like that.  Well,  who's setting a record  for the most money  spent on an inauguration?  Obama.  There's a lot of excitement,  my friend.  Excitement,  my ass.  Let's wait for him  to trip up  before we really  go after him.  You know something? 
[00:45:00]  There's a lot of hope  out there,  a lot of excitement.  Hope?  You feel it in the air.  There's a positive  feeling in this country.  Let me let you in  on a little secret.  Yeah.  Everyone isn't  pleased as punch,  and everyone isn't happy,  and when the news  gets on  and these,  these libs,  these lib news broadcasters  start going,  well,  everyone is awaiting  with excitement  for this inauguration.  No!  Everyone isn't.  Can you at least admit  that it's different?  Half the people  in this country ain't. 
[00:45:30]  Can you at least admit  that it's different  than past inauguration?  Why?  Inauguration.  Why should it be?  It seems to be.  Swear the guy in.  And then believe me,  I was reading  other message boards too,  where this guy  was on there  talking about  how  just because  Obama  is president  doesn't mean  that anything  should change  as far as  affirmative action.  There's still  racism  more than ever  because now  people are saying 
[00:46:00]  that there's no racism  because a black man  could become president.  And just because  that's happening  means there's actually  more racism.  I want to reach  through the computer screen  and just ring next.  Why does it get you  so mad though?  That's just the president.  That's really not going  to change what happens  to you and I  or anybody else.  I'm not even talking  about the president.  Not even talking  about the president.  Just the what?  I'm talking about  society.  Society.  I'm talking about  black and white people  lying to each other.  Dishonesty.  There's a giant  dishonesty going on 
[00:46:30]  between blacks and whites  and it is only  getting worse  and it has gotten worse  with the election  of Obama  and with the inauguration.  What are they expecting?  A couple of million people?  That's exciting.  Something like that.  People are coming out  for this one.  Yeah.  People.  In droves.  They haven't come out  for it in a long time.  That's right.  No one I know  is going.  Anyone you know  going to DC?  Anyone you know,  Jim?  I actually do know. 
[00:47:00]  Shut up.  Dane and Dave  are going.  Yeah.  Dane and Dave.  Yeah.  All right.  A couple of libs.  My aunt's going.  They're getting  probably paid to perform.  Oh, okay.  Oh, they're performing.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Well, that makes  perfect sense then.  I'm talking about  going to be there.  You can ask that  question every four years.  I don't know anyone  that goes down there  for this crap.  Yeah, but you could.  I get a lot of black  people going, right?  Exactly my point.  There's a lot of hope.  They're excited.  This is a...  They got someone  they feel like  they could finally relate to. 
[00:47:30]  How could that  possibly hurt in the end?  It's not a good thing  for...  It's smart to just  keep them down.  For me.  No, I'm not even  saying that.  Just keep them down.  I'm saying there's  this attitude...  They'll behave better.  The closer they...  I'm not saying that.  I'm just asking.  There's a dishonesty.  All these statements  have little question marks  after them.  That's all.  There's dishonesty  between blacks and whites  and I would love  to see a little more honesty  and I do  on the websites I visit.  This is a...  And I visit both sides. 
[00:48:00]  I saw some jackass  saying how blacks  are superior to whites  in every way.  Mentally, physically,  spiritually,  because of melanin.  Yes.  Melanin absorbs power  and it is not just  in the skin  this gentleman was saying.  It's in the brain,  in all the organs.  That's why he was saying this. 
[00:48:30]  A black man.  That's why black people  are athletically better  than white people.  Well, you know,  Jimmy the Greek said that.  He got fired.  This guy,  they put him up  on a pedestal  and praise him.  Who is this guy?  What network is he doing?  Believe me,  his word is getting out there.  As much as...  It's on a pedestal somewhere.  Believe me,  as much as the word  gets out on nword.com,  nwordmania.com,  it gets out on these other sites,  the opposite... 
[00:49:00]  You want him to be fired  from his KFC job?  What are you asking for?  I'm not asking fired.  This is the honesty, though.  This is the honesty.  You get so worked up.  I do get worked up.  Because there's  a dishonesty  and hypocrisy going on.  People aren't honest.  Maybe this will get  everybody talking,  this guy.  Oh, they're talking, all right.  I understand they're talking,  but maybe we'll get  some positive things done.  They're talking.  Positive stuff?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Opens up communication  between the races.  Does it?  It's closed it down. 
[00:49:30]  Sure, why not?  It's closed it down  even more.  I do like to see  the media finally  being patriotic.  Look, they're repulsive.  But I like to see them  finally talking nicely  about a president.  Well, we'll see.  And again,  they're probably  the same with Clinton.  I'm not even like,  I'm not even talking  that much about  the president.  I'm not talking  about Obama.  That's great.  I'm not even so much  talking about Obama.  I'm talking about  how it's perceived  what this represents. 
[00:50:00]  Not what it represents.  The perception  of what it represents  to certain black people,  which I think  is a larger portion  than a lot of people  think it is.  Yeah, but that's fine.  They're expecting  way too much.  They're going to be  very disappointed  because this stuff  doesn't drastically change  no matter who goes  to Washington.  I'm not talking about that.  What are you talking about?  I'm talking about  how is it bad?  Like if people are just  maybe psyched.  I honestly haven't  had any negative experiences. 
[00:50:30]  I know you said you did.  I literally haven't  since then.  I mean, I'm interacting  every day too.  I haven't had  and maybe I will.  Yeah.  But I don't see  that's bad.  Yeah, well,  then everyone can just  continue calling me a racist.  I didn't even imply that.  I'm not saying that.  This goes deep with you.  That's all.  I don't care that much.  It makes me very angry.  I like being caught up  in the excitement of it.  Because this is a moment  that black people 
[00:51:00]  should embrace for one thing  and what I'm seeing  is it being embraced  as something else.  This is something  that should be looked at as  look how far we've come.  All right.  But it's not.  It's being looked at as  I'm getting mines.  That's what it's being looked at.  They don't want to take  Obama becoming president  as an obvious example  of what you can do  in this country 
[00:51:30]  regardless of your color.  They don't want to take it as that.  That's what I get from reading.  I read these websites.  I read a lot.  I don't read the liberal crap media  or the hard-wing right  conservative media stuff.  I read what people  are talking about.  Real people  out there in the country.  But don't you understand  those people will be disappointed  if that's how they're looking at this?  No.  It's an attitude.  I don't see that.  It's not an expectation.  They're going to be like  wait a minute.  What the F? 
[00:52:00]  I thought everything  was going to change  because we got our man in there.  They're going to be so disappointed  which will make you happy  in the end.  No, because it's the fact  that he's in  proves a point  that you can do anything  in this country  regardless of color.  Yet all I'm hearing is  yes, it is good  but I'm not hearing that.  I'm hearing  nope, still plenty of racism.  Go F yourself.  There isn't.  Look.  Look who got elected.  There.  Look out the window 
[00:52:30]  when you're flying out.  Look out the window  of any airplane  you're flying out.  Who's loading your bags in  at every goddamn airport  you go to?  Oh my gosh.  I'm just saying.  All right.  So what does that mean?  So don't tell me  you can't get jobs.  But you very rarely do hear  yo y'all  this your captain.  You know.  You don't hear that very often.  No.  Well, I've been on 
[00:53:00]  many flights  with African American pilots  first officers  whatever.  Yeah.  I haven't.  Well, there's one woman to date.  Worf was a black man  on Star Trek The Next Generation.  All right.  Let's go to Brian in the Bronx.  I'll humor you  and put one of your supporters  on today.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  I'm on board with you  all the way.  I was taking the bus  the other day  and a black woman  she's got bands  on one seat  and another seat.  I said, you know,  hey, can you move your bag?  I can't wait  until Obama gets in  and Obama gets in.  I can't wait.  Can't wait. 
[00:53:30]  I can't wait.  I have to take up  four seats on the bus.  Where is this going on?  Dude, I walk around  all the time.  No hogs.  Come on.  Some awful lady  with a bunch of bags.  I mean, whatever.  You're acting like...  If she thinks that way,  whatever.  I laugh at those people.  You're not educated enough  to understand  what happens with this.  Yes.  You're acting like  it's Condoleezza Rice.  It's just some bitch  on the bus  who probably went home  and shat in her own shoe.  Why did I say that?  That's hysterical.  I don't know why  I said that.  No one is being honest. 
[00:54:00]  That's all I'm saying  is there's got to be  this more...  And I don't mean  individually.  I just mean  kind of as a society.  There's everybody...  The news is presenting this  as if the entire country  is pleased as punch  that this historic moment  is happening  and that's what you hear.  Everybody.  They say  everybody  is excited. 
[00:54:30]  No.  It's not the truth.  First of all,  I just don't like  a hardcore lib  being in there  that's going to  redistribute my money  that I've worked for.  We'll wait and see.  Don't like that.  Let's see what he gets done.  Yeah, we'll see what he gets done  but that's what he's promised.  Also, do you think  after, let's say  September 12th, 2001  let me just pick a random date  do you think 
[00:55:00]  we'd ever have  this president  who's promising  within the first couple of weeks  to shut down Guantanamo  and has people bitching  that we're torturing  those poor lads down there  who are Al-Qaeda  and talking about torture  as being sleep deprived  being held nude  being questioned for hours on end  waterboarding  that's torture? 
[00:55:30]  We would have been up in  we would have been like  yeah  and if a guy came along  with a platform Obama has  then  we'd all say  go crapping your hat  and now look  a few short years later  everyone just forgot  y'all forgot  I agree with him on  everyone forgot  I understand  Barack Hussein Obama  is getting elected  president of the United States  tell me that on September 12th  tell me that  I would have bet 
[00:56:00]  everything I own against it  and now instead of losing that way  I'm going to lose through taxes  it's good to know  we've moved forward  and we've learned from  the events of 9-11  yeah  let them all loose then  let them all go  close down Guantanamo  there you go  good idea  I just like the excitement  I like that more people  are interested in the system  and politics in general  no one knows about politics  they're all stupid  I like that there's  for the first time in a long time  there's this hope in the air  hope  a buzz  there's a buzz 
[00:56:30]  a bit of a buzz  the only reason  there's any excitement  is the color of his skin  stop it already  stop it  they're judging this man  on the color of his skin  which is what Martin Luther King  said don't do  and that's the only reason  there's excitement  and there's this  history making inauguration  and the news is all over it  with their promos  and graphics  and all that happy horse crap  that's why  everyone  as they say  is excited  it's a lie  I like his charisma  I like that he still goes  and works out 
[00:57:00]  and plays a little basketball  that's good  I like how he speaks in public  well spoken  articulate  he seems to talk  to the common man  he averaged Joe  that's fantastic  you know who else had charisma  a man named Adolf Hitler  he was very charismatic  he certainly got the people  behind him  you're scared the blacks  are going to rally now  what?  I didn't say that  I'm just asking  no  that was a question mark again  remember  cult of personality  I didn't say you said  any of this stuff  the guy  I got questions 
[00:57:30]  was elected  based on  the color of his skin  the excitement  I'll tell you what he's based on  he's based on the color of his skin  he was elected  based on the fact  that the Republicans  yeah okay  put a horrible  ticket  yep  and miscalculated  Hillary's impact  so badly  that they stuck  Sarah Palin  who I don't think  deserved to be vilified  the way the media did  but she was  a tremendously  terrible  of course she deserved  all that they threw at her 
[00:58:00]  no no no  but I mean  she had no business  being in that  she didn't  but they immediately  vilified her  like she was an awful person  and that was just  left wing bias  I'm not saying  she was qualified  but they killed her  unnecessarily  but she was not qualified  and it was a terrible  terrible ticket  I know  so that's the main reason  the Republicans  and they almost won with that  McCain did well  with that  I mean with that  that albatross  it wasn't just  it wasn't just  because the guy was black  look at  who  should have been picked  by the Democrats  then 
[00:58:30]  I don't know  we don't even remember  who was running against Obama  at this point  except for Clinton  and he loses  possibly right man  but I don't know about that  depending on who was running man  I mean  you had the Mitt Romney  maybe  should they have picked Mitt Romney  you pick Mitt Romney  they lose  I just think  all the excitement  I like the excitement  is based on the color  of his skin  it's fun  you're seeing black people  you're seeing black people  that are very excited  about Obama getting in 
[00:59:00]  that know nothing about him  and they haven't  from the get go  we'll learn  we'll learn as we go  learn as we go  we'll learn as we go  yeah  okay  let me tell you  another learn as we go  as we go through Poland  Czechoslovakia  and France  that was a learn as we go  learn as we blitzkrieg  what state do you think  the blacks are going to  take over first  are they going to start  like with Michigan  and then start moving  their way  well  you got to look at the maps  that are up  that show where the population 
[00:59:30]  where does this begin  where do the blacks begin  taking states  in your humble opinion  southeast  southeast  yeah the southeast  and the Gulf states  I think Atlanta would be  the place to start  the big black revolution  base of operations  they seem to have  a lot smarter blacks  down there  right  look  you are saying this  I'm not  I'm just being honest  and saying that  this excitement  is based on the color  of his skin  I like it  and  enough with old white guy  let's see what  yeah yeah  perish the thought 
[01:00:00]  old white guy  look how bad it's been  for this country  for a couple of hundred years  stupid old white guys  in there  yeah with all us  going to the moon  and other stuff  stop  yeah let's take a look  we're not the big  superpower we used to be  my friend  yeah and you know why  China is right on our heels  because we've turned into  a pussy nation  we've turned into  a wimpy nation  of politically correct  douches  that will elect  the likes of  Barack Obama  his socialist  ass  programs  that's why we're not 
[01:00:30]  the superpower  you got a guy like  Reagan in there  that's the reason  there's no more  Soviet Union  not this pussy  and Hillary Clinton  isn't even in yet  as Secretary of State  and she's already  setting up play dates  with Iran  I want to talk to Iran  I agree  but I'm sick and tired  of this stupid  talk to him  with  I'm tired of  bombs  talk to him  with JDAMS  that's how you talk to Iran  with JDAMS  whammo 
[01:01:00]  you do understand  that we have no choice  we've got to get along  with the rest of the world  yeah  in the year 2009  do we  do we got to get along  with people that chop  people's heads off  no we don't  we have to figure something out  no we don't  we certainly do  no we don't  you want to get along  with people that chop  people's heads off  why not  well we got to at least  try to figure something out  no each other  I don't care either  I'd love for them  to all kill each other  but they're chopping  you know  occasionally  they get one of our guys  and chop their heads off  I'm telling you  where that started  that beheading started  and this was where 
[01:01:30]  the military  I know this is not  the whole military  this is a few scumbags  Abu Ghraib  was such a disaster  it was a disaster  public relations  it was stupid dude  it was a stupid  you know what  disaster  do you understand  what happens  to our soldiers  when they're imprisoned  by these savage nations  do you even understand  do you think  Abu Ghraib  was this big a deal  you know who made it  a big deal  the libs  the lib pussy  wimpy asses  that have turned  this country  into the 
[01:02:00]  not old white guy  running it  but Obama running it  that's who did that  that's why  it's an atrocity  that some guys  were stacked up  in a pyramid  naked  sorry when they're  leaving our soldiers  hanging from bridges  burnt to a crisp  that was not  he wasn't a soldier  that guy  Nick  I know who you mean  no I'm talking about  other soldiers  yeah  no no but that was  it wasn't the liberal  media here  who was repulsive  that was more of  Al Jazeera  who I can't really say  is uh  it's like in that 
[01:02:30]  situation  I know it's only a few  people doing it  but it was a terrible  I'd rather take  Al Jazeera  for my information  than uh  CBS News  excuse me  I'll work for them  uh NBC  we gotta take your  we gotta take your  blood pressure  so obvious  you need to go into  uh like uh  political talk radio  oh I just  I see the end  more than Bob Grant  I see the end  it's coming now  I see it  I make Bob Grant  look like a liberal  you need to like  start doing  political talk radio  do I  oh yeah  you'd be a huge hit  for the next 
[01:03:00]  four to eight years  I'll wait till this  uh you know  schlong humor show  uh  is done  maybe I'll do that  as much as the  liberal media  influences people here  yes  and it does  Al Jazeera  influences people there  and when they're  showing those images  yeah  look let's be honest  a lot of people  dumb  not getting at least  the wide variety  of news we have here  so all they're seeing  a lot of people  is this image  of Americans  in this country  humiliating their men  that's what they see  it's like  it was a stupid  stupid thing 
[01:03:30]  that turned probably  a lot of moderate people  who were like  we didn't like Saddam  either  into their humiliating  Muslim men  which is not what  the military is doing  but again  the way the liberal media  blows things up here  is exactly what  Al Jazeera did over there  so you can't give them  something like that  but can I  can I  can you  can you answer me  one question then  um  during the great war  of World War II  uh  which everybody  remembers um  as just a fantastic  looking through  rose colored glasses  almost uh  a patriotic 
[01:04:00]  good cause  all that  do you know  how today's people  would  would  would just  in their pants  if they saw  an American soldier  light up  a Japanese soldier  with a flamethrower  yet that was shown  before movies  when you went  to the movie theater  holla  that was  when people  in this country  understood  what this country  was about  what uh 
[01:04:30]  uh  was needed  to be done  to emerge victorious  to be a world power  you have to do  awful things  true  and now  you're not allowed  you stack up  some nude savages  in some prison  over in uh  Iraq  and uh  people are  court martialed  people lose their gigs  it  it's ludicrous  when you're walking  around as the world's  policeman  and we don't keep  our fat faces  out of anybody's  business 
[01:05:00]  let them all kill  each other  is the way I feel  when we walk around  with morality  and shoving it  down everybody's  throats  we had better  behave that way  or at least not  videotape it  on a cell phone  and send it  I mean  we can't have it  both ways  and that annoys me  that we're even  there to begin with  I don't care if  Saddam murdered  everybody in the country  yeah I don't either  believe me  I don't either  but uh  the reason  there's such  outcry  at everything  we do these days  is because  people call us out  on things that  are necessary  to be a superpower 
[01:05:30]  you can't be a  superpower  and not  and not flex  your muscle  you've got  you've got  and if you go  into a war  you have to fight it  you have to fight it  nasty  and playing pyramid  playing pyramid  with some prisoners  to me  is not a big deal  when you then  as we've had  in the past  pull them out  of crashed helicopters  and shoot them  in the head  and chop them up  set them on fire  now that's  a motivated  military 
[01:06:00]  when you look  at the first  Gulf War  like that one  big poster boy  the US  pilot who was  shot down  Zahn or whatever  they began with  the Z's last name  they were released  they weren't  they were maybe  mistreated  but they were  they were released  they weren't murdered  they weren't beheaded  they were beat up  very very nicely  alright fine  but they weren't  during their interrogation  the beheadings happened  and I'm not defending them  by these radicals  after  that's why they were  dressing them all  in those orange jumpsuits 
[01:06:30]  that's why they were  dressing them in that  because that was why  I think the beheadings  started  it was just  it was a bad image  a bad image  for this country  to put out  it was a bad image  in this day and age  it was terrible  in this day and age  a bad image  in this day and age  years ago  it wouldn't have been  a bad image  it would have been like  hey  screw them  maybe yeah  yeah  we've turned into  a  a  information wasn't  passed  whipped little country  back then  that wasn't  passed  listen we got it  we got a break  we certainly 
[01:07:00]  can continue with this  because we got the video  that really upset you today  we still haven't played that  that'll be after the break  I have my upsetting video  of the day  and I kind of like it  what I troll the websites for  how do you get upset  by kids singing  alright we'll get into it  after the break  and the phones  just to make Anthony happy  Obama is going to give  everyone a nice big safety net  that's Russ in Queens  Clint from New York City  Ant needs to look at it  from a black perspective  sorry  Donnie in Jersey  just because Obama's elected  doesn't mean racism is dead 
[01:07:30]  oh really  Mike is Opie smoking crack  Jesse from Jersey  when is Ant accepting  enrollment in his militia  Mike in Fort Knox  Ant sure talks a lot  about military  without ever being in it  I can't  please  don't even give me that  everyone  sorry  sorry I missed out  on the nom  by four years  or something  five  I heard you  four years  yeah like five years  I heard you escape  to Canada 
[01:08:00]  no  I think I missed out  by five years  how old are you  Jill in Boston  you missed out by seven  shut up  nope  not at all  not at all  not even close  I'm worried about  the big 4-0  Jill in Boston  black co-worker  thinks he can't get fired now  that's coming in  and 13 year old JC  which we love talking to  but we can't right now  maybe after the break  Obama was elected  because Bush was so terrible  very sensible  all right 
[01:08:30]  Opie and Anthony  we'll play it  yes Danny  we're trying to break  I know but just real quickly  along the same lines  I was at the DMV a few weeks ago  and I noticed  and the people  they still had their holiday  happy holiday cards up  and I noticed  across the counter  that there was an Obama  like a red and green  Obama face  and it said happy holidays  like that's how huge this is  he's a messiah  I like that  me too  no you don't  yeah I wasn't around  Jesus  maybe we can finally see a messiah  this is cool stuff  all right  this is cool stuff  I want to see some of these miracles happen now  oh jeez 
[01:09:00]  I could give you some miracles  I'd like to see  I'm a realist man  I think  realist?  yes I don't think  all these miracles  that people think are going to happen  are going to happen  I think in the end  people are going to be a bit disappointed  but I'm going with the excitement  and the hope that is out there right now  all right  why not  maybe something positive will happen  because of all that  all right  that's all I'm at  all right  I know my life ain't changing  I might have to give up  I might have to give up a few more bucks  that I'm never going to spend anyway 
[01:09:30]  who gives a crap  oh really?  yes  I'll have plenty of money  for the rest of my life  I don't care  you think?  yeah it's not important to me  I don't care  I know how much money I got  I know how much money I need  and if they take a little more off the top  believe it or not  I'm fine with that  if it helps  good luck  how about you know how much money you got  you know how much I need  why don't we all start  I'll give you a few  a few bucks  how much you need  I don't know  I might have $17 on me today  you want it?  helping for $4 million  you want to kick in my share then?  you kick in my share  of the tax increase 
[01:10:00]  to give to people  yeah but you're never going to spend that money anyway  yes I am  how much are you spending?  a lot  you're crazy  I spend a lot of money  I spend a lot of money Opie  you can't spend like this show's going to last another few years  this thing is  gotta save for your future my friend  future schmoocher  Anthony's the only millionaire who lives from paycheck to paycheck  no kidding  are you crazy?  that's not our problem?  I'm enrich  that's not our problem 
[01:10:30]  you're overspending my friend  I am not  putting equity in my house is what I'm doing  that's what I'm doing  what?  I am  what about  whatever  what?  you know the  oh gambling?  Jesus  if I've blown  ten people  are they  classic rock again? 
[01:11:00]  then Lizzie  thank you Kenny  it's Opie and Anthony  I need Tums after Anthony's rant  really?  no not really  I don't really care that much  kind of like the Obama thing  but  you know what really makes me mad  is this Madoff guy  makes me way madder than Obama being our president  the judge not jailing him  and the judge is not jailing this guy  and they're saying  what do they call it in the paper today? 
[01:11:30]  a mob scene?  they went a little further with their language  but there are people pissed off  and then they parade the guy in and out of court  with a bulletproof vest  and I think that is so insulting  to the people that have been victimized  look if you need to  give the guy the bulletproof vest  put it under his effing clothes  yeah  at the very least  I personally think  no you know  take your chances  going in and out of the courtroom  without the bulletproof vest  it's such an insult  to the people that  have been affected  they do it with murderers 
[01:12:00]  and all that  it's like  ugh  yes Jimmy  sorry  it's humiliating for him though  this is a guy  this scumbag  was living off  everybody else's money  for a long time  and now here he is  70 years old  he has to wear a bulletproof vest  because people want to murder him  it's great to see  and he's enjoying the attention  he's got a little smirk  and a little smile on his face now  when they  could be  when they  you know  get video of him  I think that's a great tactic  like for the cops  where you put  a bulletproof vest  on somebody  and it's like 
[01:12:30]  hey  dude  people want to kill you  it kind of reinforces  the idea  in the guy's head  it probably scares  the crap out of him  when they put that vest on you  it's like  dude  we're doing this  because people want to kill you  he's probably gotten a lot of death threats  maybe three or four  perhaps more  everyone go out there  with their laser pointers  and just kind of point your lasers out of it  if you really want to scare them  yeah  if you really want to scare them  one of the rags here in New York  I don't acknowledge them 
[01:13:00]  as a newspaper  Bernie is  it's not too late  to do the right thing  jump  to sign the guy's holding up  someone had a sign  outside his apartment  with that  I want to go up there  and check out the craziness  because they really want to  rip this guy apart  there he is  looks like George Washington  yes he does  why isn't  why isn't they  at least putting him in jail  for something  this judge is disgusting  what is up with that  that I'm bail  if you don't pay a parking ticket  and avoid that for a while  they'll throw you in jail  right 
[01:13:30]  yeah well  apparently he's on bail  oh he's going to see jail  believe me  he'll see jail  but who knows when  the judge said  he's not a flight risk  and he doesn't represent  a threat to society  good for the judge  but you know what  house arrest  when you own a  multi-million dollar  you know  pad in New York City  they should take that  into consideration  you know  most of us live  in crappy places  and you know  if we were under  house arrest  it would really suck  not in his case  not in his case 
[01:14:00]  I'm like under  house arrest every day  I just go in my house  yeah but you  you decide that  yeah I know  that's why I don't know  why he gets  house arrest  that's why I don't know  I don't understand  why he gets so upset  because you don't even  interact with people  for this to  really affect you  I do too  I'm on Pell Talk  all the time  you know what I'm saying  like real  interaction with human beings  where you can almost  you know  smell their bad breath  I sit at poker tables  with people  yeah  and I'm on Pell Talk  that's how I interact 
[01:14:30]  with people  you're so isolated  that this stuff  shouldn't bother you  really  I think so  my dumb opinion  I know they're dumb  uh  Ant spends money  because he's trying  to fill the hole  where his heart should be  oh stop it  I've loved  I've lost  by the way  Kenny's really trying  to like  help out the radio show  uh stunt brain  did Kenny quit  we got the video 
[01:15:00]  that Anthony  is bothered by  that's the direction  we're heading in  but this was just  handed to me  I don't know  if you guys know  but stunt brain  is losing his hair  and none of us  want to acknowledge it  but uh  but Rogaine Foam  has decided  to come to the rescue  and now  because he's doing  the live reads  for this Rogaine Foam  now we can openly  acknowledge that  wow  your head  is a disaster  well he's  he's thin  wouldn't it be ironic  to shave with Rogaine Foam 
[01:15:30]  that's not a bad idea  that's a uh  might be a Stephen Wright joke  it's a small world  but I wouldn't want  to shave it  okay  um  so Kenny  handed in his ball jokes  that maybe I could work  into the uh  the Rogaine Foam reads  and stunt brain  for the people  that are fortunate enough  to get to hear the commercials  wow  um  so  you want to read this Kenny  you do a better Kenny  than me  Kenny actually typed  these out  evenly spaced 
[01:16:00]  very proud of his work  oh yeah  that means I'm closer  to being retarded  than you by the way  that's not a compliment  you do a better Kenny  than me  thanks  you're so bald  the lice on your head  are homeless  you're so bald  I can see  what you're thinking  you're so bald  that when you wear  a turtleneck  you look like  a roll on deodorant  are you really 
[01:16:30]  that bald  or is your neck  just blowing a bubble  be more funny  you are so bald  that when you wear  a turtleneck  you look like  a broken condom  this is going great  you're so bald  that you haven't  used keys in years  because you lost  all your locks  it sucks  oh wow  that's a reach  unfortunately  that is the end  of the  Betty of bald jokes  he handed this  as real material 
[01:17:00]  that's uh  believe it or not  he was probably  all excited  oh yeah  he handed it over  I contributed  you know  you could maybe  squeeze a couple  of these in GH  not that my lines  are setting the  comedy world on fire  I understand  but  what are you going to get  I'm just going off  the cuff  so I could at least  use that as an excuse  now we're going to get  something on our email  invoice for bald jokes  handling charge  handling charge  I'm going to have to  charge you a handling charge 
[01:17:30]  which is fine  but when you look at it  on his itemized  effing billy  sends every month  yeah  and then what does he write  please  pay  what does he say  Jimmy help me out  before a certain  I don't know  yeah he's threatening us  or there will be  a 10%  late fee  good luck collecting  that Muldoon  he itemizes everything  like he keeps track  of all the coffee  and everything  and then the handling  charge is such  a ridiculous amount 
[01:18:00]  that's what I think  is hilarious  I love looking at  the bills though  that I get  it's like  $40 for grapes  that's what you're doing  billing me  for grapes  handling charge  on the grapes  17 cents  washing of grapes  lotion  to cure  chapping  incurred by  washing grapes  are you really  that bald  or is your neck  just blowing a bubble  I gotta be honest  I do like that one  that one wasn't bad 
[01:18:30]  but I couldn't laugh  because I'd already  been stunned  by the other ones  oh it's awful  it's like someone  telling a great joke  in the middle of a rape  you ever notice  with Kenny Toe  that if you ask him  to help you out  with something  and then he gives you  the info  that you need  then he gets obsessed  until you actually  do something  with that info  it's some weird  OCD thing with him  you guys have  a little more contact  with him than I 
[01:19:00]  as far as on a  business  personal level  I'll be honest  he does all that  crap I have no  desire to do  I had a problem  with my internet  cable  and I didn't even  feel like looking  up the customer  service number  so I just like  wrote him  hello  this is Kenny  we are very busy  today  please hold  for our next  available Kenny  so then he gives 
[01:19:30]  me the number  and then he's  obsessed with  if I've called  or not yet  of course  I'm like yeah  I'll get to it  he's got to check  up to make sure  you're using the  information  yeah  that's what I'm  getting at  gathered for you  can I say though  Kenny is a guy  who is detail  oriented  and he's great  at that stuff  oh yeah  he makes your life  easier because  he's competent  like he knows  what he's doing  he knows how to  handle things  there's no one  better to go  through airport  security with  oh my god  nobody cares 
[01:20:00]  less about what  other people  think of them  than Kenny  he will walk  up  Kenny will step  he will step  into a stroller  onto the baby  to go  hey do you  think you  could let me  through  and he'll  flash the bag  on a celebrity  walkthrough  and they look  over and it's  me  they're expecting  like Tom Cruise  or Brad Pitt  or something  what is it  called  a celebrity  walkthrough  and of course  that gets them  intrigued  they're like yeah  and they'll look  over and I'm  standing there  with my awful  sunglasses  my laptop bag 
[01:20:30]  with your shoulders  slumped over  yeah who is that  the guy with  Pete Townsend's  email address  who is that  speaking of details  Jim do you want  to pick your  flight and seats  for San Francisco  I do yes  not now  but I will yes  do it way later  it'll drive them  nuts  yeah  maybe later  alright  because I got  a nice diagram  for the seating  chart  of course you do  can I see that  actually  Mike on Long Island  Mike  what's going on  guys  hey Mike  thank you  yeah I just  wanted to talk  about Bernie Madoff  real quick  I mean we have 
[01:21:00]  Obama coming in  he's going to be  charging us enough  in taxes  why should we  pay more taxes  to keep this guy  in jail  when he could be  sitting at home  I mean who cares  you know  I mean he lost  enough money  in the market  you're one of  those guys  you don't want  to pay to have  this guy in jail  well why should we  pay for him to be  in jail  I mean you know  he's hurt us  enough  I mean why pay  more money  for the guy  you know  to put him  in Rikers Island  you mean  Bernie Madoff  right  to put him  in Rikers Island  where he will  be probably  beaten up  I'm willing  to spend  a few bucks  on that 
[01:21:30]  I'll tell you  why dude  do you guys  really think  that he's going  to be hurting  in Rikers Island  I mean this guy  is a billionaire  hey dude  here's why  you're wrong  here's why  I don't agree  with you  if you put  the guy  in jail  white collar  guys are not  used to being  put  especially in  Rikers  and these  awful places  other guys  seeing this  guy put in  jail  will eventually  save people  money  because  if you see  a guy  with that  much money  being put  in a  hardcore  place  people might  be a little  less likely  to do it  so in the  long run 
[01:22:00]  it may actually  save us  money  more than  getting into  a hardcore  place  what do you  have to  him actually  getting into  general population  that's what  has to happen  why shouldn't  he  he'll never  do that  but then  we gotta  change how  we do  things  I'm not  a money  guy  when it comes  to that  stuff  I would  hope by  jailing this  guy at  Rikers or  something  maybe give  some of the  victims out  there just  a little  bit of  comfort  like okay  instead of  knowing that  this guy is  hanging out  in his  penthouse  on the  Upper East  Side  enjoying the  luxuries of 
[01:22:30]  life  no one's  really brought  this up  but let's  look at  the victims  greedy  sons of  bitches  who bought  into this  guy's scheme  to try to  make some  quick bucks  it's not  like  these legitimate  investors  that did  their research  due diligence  you know  if this guy's  running a  Ponzi scheme  he's not  a quick  turn over  in Fairfield 
[01:23:00]  Connecticut  he cost the  whole township  their pensions  these were  like a lot  of regular  people  who invested  in somebody  and their  investors  went through  Madoff  these people  they don't  even know  these people  that lost  their homes  like one  couple I read  about sold  their home  don't you  have homes  they lost  the money  for their  they sold  the house  they lost  the house  they sold  it  and the money  they had  just gotten  for it  their investor  believed in  Madoff  so put the  money with him  so they lose  everything  a lot of  regular people  lost a lot  of money  from this piece  of  middleman  yeah  yeah  gotcha  alright Mike  good call 
[01:23:30]  oh this is  very good news  Time Warner  cable guy  from New York  Opie your  cable account  has been  taken care  of anyway  if you call  you're a VIP  it's all been  taken care  of Mr. Durden  thank god  thank you sir  Mr. Durden  huh  thank you  okay  we got the  video that  pissed you off  last night  is this gonna  be a regular  thing every day  you bring in  another video  for everybody  oh believe me  I could  I'm a bit  confused by today  yesterday  actually  yesterday I was  annoyed by

[01:24:30]  video of  kids  singing  about  Obama  yep  alright  well  I'll have  an open  mind  going into  this  maybe you  could turn  me around  again  nah  you could  shut it  you could  shut your  mind  this one's  bad  this one is  a rough  one  no no  it's one  of those  things  why  why are  they going  to the  inauguration  we're gonna  get a peek  at your  soul  in a little  while  why are  they going  to the  inauguration  alright  we'll find  out next  you listen  to them  and tell  me  do they  deserve  to be  at the  inauguration  you got  a video  for tomorrow  yet  oh believe  me  they're all  videos  but obviously 
[01:25:00]  we do  radio  so we  we'll play  I got  a source  yeah  I got  a source  for these  videos  believe me  website  I visit  this is a  quickie  because we  really want  to get  traffic to  onaradio.com  so we put  a lot of  visuals up  there  for anyone  that cares  about boy  George  and I'm  sure there's  not many  of you out  there  you gotta  see the  latest picture  of boy  George  really  unrecognizable  we'll pop  that up  there  yeah  it was  on one  of those  fine sites  he looked  hetero  yeah  with a girl  smiling  you know  it's funny 
[01:25:30]  you say  that  yeah  he sort  of does  he sort  of does  it's amazing  it's the  same guy  from the  80s  and he's  trying to  find a  really quick  right there  that is  oh my god  that's boy  George  that is boy  George  that looks  like me  if I don't  watch myself  that looks  like an older  version of  Jim Norton  yes  yes  no  that is  wow  that is boy  would you  you know  what I should  have done  showed you  that picture  and had  you guess  who is that  I never  would have  you wouldn't  have guessed 
[01:26:00]  boy George  right  never  and once  again  we gotta  thank  www.tdd.com  getting a lot  of exposure  on the show  lately  they got the  pick  they had it  first and now  everyone else  is grabbing it  they're big  fans by the way  everybody over there  that's good to know  they really are  is he swelled up  from like  cosmetic surgery  I was gonna say  from one to him  oh  it's like  just spit it out  your cheeks  won't puff out  so much  he's storing it  in his cheeks  like a chipmunk  so he has some  for February  they're big fans 
[01:26:30]  they're big fans  did they get our  Charles Nelson  Riley photo  I sent it to him  and actually  that was the  reply to  that I got  was from the  guy that runs  the site  and he says  he's a very big  fan  the show is  the only reason  why he has  satellite  big big big  very good  then we'll say  hi to www.tdd.com  also known as  what would  Tyler Durden do  alright  so we'll put  that picture up  we'll give  those guys  credit for  certainly finding  is that it  Opie and Anthony  stay there  the Anthony thing  next  this video 
[01:27:00]  that annoyed him  gonna play  the audio  of the video  that really pissed  off Anthony  yesterday  becoming a bit  on the show  everyday  I think he'll  bring something  in  when he's got  something  a little something  before that  just a minute  rock and roll  hall of fame time  alright  who's in  Metallica  no brainer  run DMC  depending on  your definition  of the rock  and roll  hall of fame 
[01:27:30]  it should be  the music  hall of fame  obviously  no brainer  for run DMC  I mean I think  the name of the  place throws  everyone off  it's obviously  a music  hall of fame  yeah  cause they throw  the pop artists  and all that  stuff in  they just run  out of rock  bands  that are worthy  of the hall of fame  and we talk  about these people  all the time  Jeff Beck  yeah  these niche  people  getting into  the rock and roll  hall of fame  I can go to the 
[01:28:00]  phones for the  next hour  I don't think  we're gonna find  a Jeff Beck  fan  um  oh Jimmy  you're a Jeff  no  yes  no  I love  Jeff Beck  name one song  he did  uh  exactly  Tulips and  Die Dead  I don't know  I only like  the sounds  I never learned  the words  Jeff Beck  come on  did Jeff Beck  have even a  pseudo hit  uh  like one of  those guys  that's just  kinda  I pride myself  on knowing 
[01:28:30]  uh  you know  some music  knowledge  and I had  to play  the stupid  songs for  many many  years  and it was  just one of  those bands  you never  played  I think I  played them  in college  radio  but in  on commercial  radio  even  in some of  my uh  situations  where we got  to go a  little deeper  you never  went to  Jeff Beck  he's a  musician  what the hell  is this song  I forgot  musician's  musician  Jeff Beck  but he's  in the  rock and roll  hall of fame  and  R&B  great  Bobby  Womack 
[01:29:00]  I believe  right  yes  what did he do  also  little Anthony  and the  Imperials  ah  is that  some of  that doo-wop  tears on my pillow  they were good  yeah  they were good  oh that's  alright  yeah  I thought  they were doo-wopping  from their stoop  those guys  yeah  in Brooklyn  I was always  in Brooklyn  around the  flaming garbage  can  to keep warm  they're actually  the group  in the original  Rocky  that he sang  with  oh really  no  you got me 
[01:29:30]  my streak  is over  you finally  got me  you finally  got me  I know  all your  tells  when you  nailed me  that time  Fred from  Brooklyn  saying  Jeff Beck  Wired  great album  why is it  a great  album  he doesn't  say  he just  said  great  album  I'm trying  to remember  people get  ready  oh yeah  well he  played  that's a  Rod Stewart  song  yeah  I mean  let's say  hi to  Jeff in  Jersey  Jeff  hey  what's  going on 
[01:30:00]  guys  hey  buddy  hey  I've been  listening to  Jeff Beck  all my life  I love his  music  what's your  last name  Beck  oh very good  I didn't  notice that  I listen to  this stuff  all the time  it's mostly  instrumental  there's not  a lot of  words to  it  but it's  great  background  music  I'm just  saying  he didn't  have like  huge success  he was a  niche guy  he comes  in  New York  and I think  he was white  huh  say that  again  he's had  a lot of  bands he's  played with  like Rod 
[01:30:30]  Stewart  and  Free  I think  it was  what is  his big  song  that  when you  say Jeff  Beck  you say  this was  his song  and don't  go with  I would say  people get  ready  but that's  not fair  that's a  Rod Stewart  song  I think  he was  like one  of those  you know  kind of  something  that was  all him  guitarists  right  no he  does a lot  of background  work  so  going down  rocks  yeah  he's got  one called  is that just  somebody  off topic  or is there  a song  you never 
[01:31:00]  could tell  with this  show  all right  we're trying  to figure  out  the  Jeff  Beck  song  that  everyone  would  know  I'm  talking  to  everybody  not  because  you're  a  Jeff  Beck  fan  like  what  was  the  one  song  they would  play  during the  electric  lunch  electric  lunch  or the  5 o'clock  traffic jam  I had to do  a 5 o'clock  traffic jam  I never  jammed Jeff  Beck  during the  5 o'clock  traffic jam  does Jeff  Beck  ever make it  through the  A through  Z 
[01:31:30]  nope  he doesn't  even  firecracker  500  he doesn't  get holiday  to enjoy  any of  those  nothing  never  a Jeff  Beck  never  a Jeff  Beck  two for  my friend  oh  never  you couldn't  find one  and certainly  never a foreplay  of Jeff  Beck  where the  fourth cut  is always  live  season of the  witch  is that the  one everyone  would say  is a Jeff  Beck  cut  is that  the one  is that  it  huh  it can't  be because 
[01:32:00]  I don't  have it  here  in the  master  computer  what Jeff  Beck  song  there's  a lot  but not  that  throw a  couple  at me  that's the  Beatles  really  it wasn't  that stupid  to have a  song called  a day  in the  life  did he  cover that  song  can we  hear a  little bit  I don't  have it  here  do we  have anything  by him  that's the  point I'm  yesterday  he's a  niche guy  I play  with a lot  of people  a lot  of bands  sure  here you  want me to  throw something  on and see  if you know  it  yeah  throw on  a Jeff 
[01:32:30]  Beck  song  here's  something  from his  best of  album  so maybe  you guys  know this  I know  I don't  oh yeah  he was  popular in  1776  totally  do  totally  do  I'm 
[01:33:00]  tootity  doing  it was  fun  uh  alright  to go  this  sucks  a  major  league  hog  I'm  with  you  it's  like  jazz  I  remember  he did  a version  of  Bolero  he's  a great  guitarist  but uh  commercial  success  I don't  think he  really got  a lot  of that  I'm sure  he made  a good  living  but  you want  Bolero  well no  they're also  saying I  think the  song is  Freeway  Jam  that was  the one  that is 
[01:33:30]  the one  I know  that one  that's what  this is  well then  this is  Freeway  Jam  this totally  proved my  point  get to the  middle  of it  oh wait  there he  is  decided  to say  hi  he's a  good musician  but it's  just boring  music  who's  sitting and  listening to  this unless  you're just  a guitarist  that  this is  self-serving  crap  I could do  this on  Guitar Hero  easy  Danny could  this is good  Dolomite walking  down the street  music  no 
[01:34:00]  he's giving  up  are you  retired  now  no  no  I just  gotta get  back to where  I was  like a year  and a half  good luck  to you  I haven't  kicked your  ass  oh  see here  it comes  remember this  part  yeah we used  it on commercial  beds  10's show  club  10's show  club  all the nude  women you  want to see  I felt bad  for some of  these artists  because they  were perfect  for commercials  and that's  not how they  wanted their  music to be  heard  but it'd be  like Ant  was saying  Major 
[01:34:30]  World  yeah  alright  yeah I know  that one  okay  alright moving  on  so  exactly  correctamundo  he hated  to say  wrong  too  fond  apparently  hated  to say  no  to  script  ideas  oh  you got  it  oh  thank you  oh  what is  it  I was  going  I was  I was  crashing  last night  I was  flipping  around  and they  did  some  kind  of  show  on  sitcoms  and they  were  doing  honeymooners  and talking  about  the  sitcom  and why 
[01:35:00]  it was  important  in pop  culture  and our  lives  when we  were  growing up  and blah  blah  blah  excuse me  two seconds  I never  get to do  this  hang up  on every  Jeff Beck  call please  yeah  that's a very good idea  we didn't care that much  we were just giving you a little knowledge  and they played a clip  from All in the Family  and Archie Bunker is talking about  a black president  uh huh  maybe we could play this first  and then Anthony's  uh  sure  I'd want to hear Archie Bunker  all right  absolutely  and then that inflammatory clip 
[01:35:30]  that Anthony talked about  oh  it's kids singing  I mean  I definitely understand where the rage is coming from  sure  you don't deserve to be at the inauguration  here's um  Archie Bunker talking about  the black president  why does it say five minutes  did it burn wrong  let's see what happens  all right  five minutes  Archie Bunker  da da da  da da  that's not five minutes  boy the way  Glenn Miller  just the whole beginning  commercials in between  not nice  and fool  mother nature  I can't believe  I ate the whole thing  if you threw this on TV today 
[01:36:00]  it would be  it would be outrage  back then it was like  it's our TV  it's funny TV  sure  yeah Sam  see people would be outraged  because  they wouldn't hear anything  really  Sam screwed up  Sam screwed up  too busy  giving oral favors  uh  exactly  unless you give a hickey to the machine  we'll get a better copy of that  let's get to Anthony's  uh  I like the fact that you say  a better copy  as if that was kind of an okay one  yeah  it might be 
[01:36:30]  a better copy  you know  has sound  it might be  because it's five minutes  so I bet you  if I go to the last  19 seconds  because the clip's 19 seconds  I bet you it would be there  but who has the time  but who cares  right  so let's get into Anthony's  uh  the video  that really upset him last night  here's the audio  all I hear is hope man 
[01:37:00]  this is outrageous  a little bit of hope in there  a little bit of hope  you know what  they're not good enough  to sing at the inauguration  there's something to be said about  they're just not good enough  songs about the president  you didn't get many Bush songs  they suck 
[01:37:30]  you can be behind me alright  messiah  the effing messiah 
[01:38:00]  you're right  these kids stink  they're horrible  they're not good  it's not mad  because they're singing bad  that's one part  at the words  I don't think they deserve  and the message  they're singing  I don't think they deserve  to be there  at the inauguration  right  and they  this guy  is being 
[01:38:30]  uh  uh  they're  they're treating him  like the  the second coming  of Christ  it's just  what  they're singing songs  Obama  Obama  Obama  do we have the teacher  oh yeah  we're getting it  good  with terror threats  bringing fear  we hope our words  you will soon hear  what  what happened  what happened  with terror threats  what happened  well fear  oh now you got the right one 
[01:39:00]  I don't even like  it's  it's  we're almost done with this song  and then we get to the TG  I like this song  yeah  it's catchy  dinks  it's catchy  see they acknowledged  whitey there  that should make you happy  and they said  control  Ahmadinejad  they didn't say  be friends with him  there you go  I'll give him credit  just for putting that name  in a song  how do you do that  they really had to 
[01:39:30]  shoon that  shoon horn  shoon horn that in  they had to  shoon horn it  everything that rhymes  with it comfortably  is Amistad  there's no way  to make that a happy  wonder  I could  your team has the opposite  who may be the mayor  the world see us  with an adoring eye  and our popularity  will rise  please pay off  all our debt  to shining  hands-lifting  our voices  against our  you have the power  to change the education  giving our public schools  some dedication  come to the end here  we've been schooling 
[01:40:00]  every state  so every time  we truly make it  intercepts  you create it  dear Obama  bop bop bop  Obama  wow  I just hear  a message of hope  there from  from the youngsters  it sounds like  it just sounds like  like  school children  in tattered clothes  in front of a  one  one room schoolhouse  somewhere  I just don't think  they're good  exactly  who's their musical director  Nutsy Fagan  terrible  they're awful 
[01:40:30]  you want to hear  the teacher  what part really got you  the fact that  they are  invited to the  inauguration  just because  they're from  a black school  and just because  there are a lot  of black kids  I bet  there could be  a white little  boys choir  that could sing  about Obama  we've been riding  you a bit hard  today  so we'll let  one of your  supporters in  JC from Red Bank  JC  it sounds like  the Chicago Bears  doing the Super Bowl  shuffle 
[01:41:00]  just awful  the Super Bowl  shuffle  that's funny  and this is the part  that really enraged  the teacher  with a little  announcement  it didn't enrage  me  it made me  laugh my ass  off  it's this  it's a white  guy  and he's  the music  teacher I guess  sure  could not  be gayer  oh really  could not  be gayer  he can't even  control his emotions 
[01:41:30]  when he tells  the kids  that they're going  to the inauguration  so we get some  humor here  oh yeah  these kids  worked so  hard  these kids  worked so  hard  oh  why didn't  we know  back then  what is this  Mark Pereno  Junior High  we all had  one of these  teachers  when we were  in school  why didn't  we know  I think  people are  laughing out  there  I was just  thinking that  that was a joke 
[01:42:00]  for 10 people  and it's just  great  sometimes it's  good to  google his name  he'll figure it  out  that's all  you gotta do  it's a gem  google that  story  laugh along  it comes up  on ouch.com  did you have  one of these  teachers  in school  the gay  music teacher  and we just  didn't know  we just  didn't have  knowledge  yes  it's like a  prerequisite  the drama  teacher  or the music  teacher  has to be  a gay  guy  or you know  some woman  well 
[01:42:30]  we've got  Ms. Rice  was this  music teacher  I had  and she  looked like  the Wicked  Witch of the  West  and had  a collapsed  nostril  she had  one collapsed  nostril  how'd she  sing  I don't  know  badly  we've  talked about  it a bunch  but when  I started  realizing  it was  the gym  teacher  at my  high school  she couldn't  have been  more of  a lesbian  if she  tried  big  oversized  sweater  and the 
[01:43:00]  weird  freaking  very short  hair  I'm going  to Nantucket  haircut  oh sorry  I was just  watching channel 11  and I thought  something was  up there  of course  you did  wow  how about  we turn  off the  TV  I'm tired  after a  long campaign  so we  have the  rest of  this  but just  to finish  the thought 
[01:43:30]  so then  this lesbian  gym teacher  was just  walking  to the  locker room  and I'm  sitting there  like that's  got to be  the greatest  job  in the  history  of mankind  no one's  on to you  you're just  walking in  young supple  little  high school  girls  getting ready  for gym  class  and then  they really  figured it out  where they  just put her  office in the  middle of the  locker room  in the glass  booth 
[01:44:00]  I bet that was  her idea  it's kind of  like the  I want to be  close to my  girls  kind of like  the glass  booth we  have here  in studio  it's unbelievable  where's my  whistle  I'm not using  it until I  get a new  whistle  I would do  the whistle  bit  well people  are yelling  shower time  girls  they're begging  for it  Anthony  I need a  new whistle  Anthony will  do the  lesbian gym  teacher bit  that whistle  went missing  for a day  and no one  knew where it  was it turned  up on a seat  somewhere back  there  I have no 
[01:44:30]  idea where  that was  worst  no  what's your  worst  here's the  teacher from  the video  that annoyed  Anthony  these kids  worked so  hard  and not only  were writing  that song  but learning  about issues  around the  world  and we're  so proud  of these  kids  and they've  gotten attention  from everywhere  all different  types of TV  shows  all different  types of  political  people  people all  over the  world  have recognized  that these  young kids  want to be  world leaders  and that they  have made  an impact  and the 
[01:45:00]  greatest thing  is that we've  gotten so many  calls to perform  this song  that we've  even got  some very  special calls  and next week  we're going to the  inauguration  they all screamed  because he stood  up and they  saw the plunger  on his seat  I'm crying  over here  I'm absolutely  crying  I was under  the photogs  could we get  the whole thing 
[01:45:30]  please  it sounds  very similar  love crying  people  he had  that pause  right before  and  we got  to come  for both  special people  that's great  where's that  last part  so gay  no he's a  white guy  yeah but  where's the  guy  it's Jim  in New York  City  I agree  with Anthony  I hate  gays and  blacks too  so  whoa  whoa  I never  said that  I'm just reading  Jim's instant  feedback  we have to 
[01:46:00]  play the  Bruce Kelly  audio in a  second  but I want to  hear the last  part of this  again  is that  we've gotten  so many calls  to perform  this song  that we've  even got  some very  special calls  and next week  we're going  to the  inauguration  Jesus  you gotta get  then it sounds  like something  I can't mention  or I'd get  fired  where's your  uh  you can act  like a man  that's  that's a perfect  clip  yes  you can act 
[01:46:30]  like a man  what's the  matter  and a man  in my position  can't afford  to be made  to look  ridiculous  he's very  happy for his  kids  he works  hard on the  song  he's got a lot  of attention  inauguration  yep  are they actually  going to be  at ground zero  they're performing  where though  on the main  stage  what is this  Lollapalooza  pretty much  two stages  three stages  yes  yeah  are they going  to be right  there  I don't know 
[01:47:00]  what hip hop  guys are going  to be there  give me a little  I want a list  of everyone  that's performing  at the inauguration  well you got  Bruce  give me a list  I know Bruce  stupid Bruce  that's the safe  white  enough about the  Bruce  that's the safe  white bet  we got our  we got  Bruce isn't  we're being  represented  we got Bruce  Bruce is the  downtrodden  you know he  represents uh  you know  whatever  he represents  Wendy  and the rest  of Jersey  yeah and Jersey  doesn't give a  crap about  but I want to  know uh  because I  and then there's 
[01:47:30]  speeches that  are going to  be given  uh by I  guess Martin  Luther King  the third  and um  is Beyonce  going to be  there  yeah  and then  Queen Latifah  is also going  to get up  and give a  little speech  and I'm sure  it's going  to be just  fantastic  get the list  and we'll run  down the list  after the break  we also got  the Archie  Barker talking  about a black  president  at the same  time by the  way the NAACP  has gotten  on TV  stations again  that there  isn't enough 
[01:48:00]  black representation  on television  shows  so  go screw  yourself  this was a  guy in the  White House  there you go  he's going to  be on TV  every day  see there's  just no  satisfying  them  I didn't say  that  there's just  no satisfying  people  once again  I didn't  accuse you  of that  I have  question marks  no satisfying  people  my statements  it seems 
[01:48:30]  to me  that many  not saying  all  African Americans  can't be  satisfied with  the fact that  one of their  own has  made it to  the pinnacle  of the free  world  as leader  of the free  world  and yet  it's not  good enough  it's just  not good  enough  you got  yourself in  a position  where you  don't have  to deal  with those  people  no I  do  I do  on a  daily  basis  it just  shouldn't  be that  way 
[01:49:00]  it shouldn't  be  that  now it's  enough  there you  go  now leave  me alone  stop asking  me for  change  hey hold  on we got  Ron in  North Carolina  yes Ron  yeah I  just wanted  to thank  that teacher  that music  teacher for  just saying  what he  said  wow  watch  that guy  boy that  sounded just  like him  needed to 
[01:49:30]  be saying  alright you  know what  bid on  the regulars  know what  that guy's  going for  we had the  Bruce Kelly  I know we're  trying to get  to a break  but Bruce  Kelly used  to work for  Ex-Am  and they  found kiddie porn  on his computer  and they had to  show him the  door  wait a minute  what  that wasn't  the reason  no  I hope he's  kidding  no  it's insane  to make a  statement like  that  of course that  never happened  to Bruce Kelly  oh I'm sorry  Bruce  you were being 
[01:50:00]  humorous  that was Bob  Kelly  no Bruce  was a friend  of the show  and if he  understands our  show he would  take that as  a joke  and it was  meant to be  a joke  I don't know  why he got  fired  the 80s  channel they  just changed  they just  changed it  up a little  he was always  playing music  from the 60s  and they said  look you're  20 years off  you have to  go  right  yeah we're  trying to do  an 80s thing  here  no it sucked 
[01:50:30]  too because he  had a lot of  passion  he was a great  guy  he was really  into it  but so into  it maybe he  got fired over  what we're  about to play  he went over  to one of  those live  eight things  live eight  or whatever  it was called  and he got  to see the  who live  right there  perform  and then he  had to be  our eyes  and ears  and report  back to the  satellite radio  audience  and he just  blew it  with this  is this live  yes we're live  Bruce where were  you buddy  I was right up  under these  so you know 
[01:51:00]  it's amazing  watching Pete  Townsend and  Roger Daltrey  perform these  songs after all  these years  and still have  the full spirit  of what they do  under control  I mean you know  Townsend just  continues to be  an amazing  guitar player  I'm sorry  I'm absolutely  crying  I can't help it  I really can't  this is no fake  the whole moment  just kind of  would it be fake  kind of got to me  with that video  yeah the video  was very powerful  yeah that was  this is very awkward

[01:55:30]  george bush's uh  uh... forty  million dollar price  tag on his  inauguration  i believe this is  costing two hundred  million dollars  or something like  that for obama's  and uh... where  where are the liberals  that were all  uh... up in arms  about the money  being spent  on uh...  bush's inauguration  when this is  like two hundred  million dollars  in a time where  you know  maybe two hundred  million could come  in handy  maybe you cut it  maybe you cut it  down a little bit 
[01:56:00]  maybe a little more  humble  yeah but it's time  for the conservatives  to bitch and complain  about that  yeah it's just how it  works  well how about you uh  no side's better than  the other side in the end  what about you do  with their trickery  you know  there's a lot of  trickery  what about a nice  humble  inauguration  uh... instead of  this pomp  circumstance  super bowl  halftime show  bull crap  that they're gonna  parade out  uh... for uh...  obama  because the country's  begging for this  no the country's 
[01:56:30]  not begging for it  yeah i'll tell you  who's begging for it  it certainly is  yeah  you wanted to see  the performers  yeah  which doesn't prove  your point by the  way  okay i didn't  it doesn't  look i didn't say  anything all i said  was i don't know  who's performing  i would have rattled  them off if i knew  doesn't uh... prove  your point whatsoever  so i don't know  so let me hear  all right you're  convinced that the  deck is gonna be  stacked right  i'm thinking the  deck is a little  stacked  uh... we got uh...  uh... we are one  who's that  uh... that's uh...  the song springsteen's  gonna what is we are

[02:02:00]  he didn't go  the distance  he did not  go the distance  he was making  some very  derogatory  asian  um  uh  he went all  in with the  asian slurs  but not all  in with the  black slurs  but uh  not not  was duly noted  on this show  yeah he  he he absolutely  that character  would have dropped  the n-bomb  in certain  situations he was  in  absolutely  and people  are saying  well because  he's an  older guy  that's how  he would  talk  no those  those people  would update 
[02:02:30]  their racism  yeah  he would have  used that  he would have  dropped that  older guys  wouldn't drop  the n-bomb  like that's  a new thing  of the 80s  when we're  discussing this  they're like  well no  he would have  he would have  said  what  what  he says  colored  and he says  a few others  spade or something  probably one of  they're safe  and they're like  no he would  it's one usually  reserved for ghosts  for ghosts  oh boy that's a bad one  oh that's frightening  yeah  well you don't like  ghosts  oh ghosts  are very frightening  can I get

[02:06:00]  in  Franklin  Ajay  he's in  everything  lately  Iron Man  dude  Terrence  Howard  no the  other dude  Don Cheadle  Robert Downey  Jr.  thank you  it's a  little vehicle  for Robert  Downey  Jr.  because he  befriends  Mr. Fox  as this  homeless  brilliant  soloist  what happened  Steve from  Bayshore  I'm not  even  saying  who he  says  is gonna  be speaking  there  it's about  time you  guys

[02:07:00]  that does  it for  the  oh  in  MLK3  we'll  do  readings  I think  the third  it's not  like  MLK3  exactly  like the  new model  I was  thinking  movies  like  Rocky  oh  like a  sequel  Halloween  3  we all  know  how the  third  one  is  you know  they're  making  another  Friday  the  13th  what  happens  sorry  Jason  wins  the  election  he's  political  he chops  the heads  off  all the  far  heads  of state  and that's  the  actual 
[02:07:30]  swearing  in  ceremony  yes  Aretha  Franklin  oh  you gotta  like the  Aretha  come on  here  all right  come on  Aretha  rocks  now can  I ask  you  something  sure  why  would  I sit  and watch  this  Aretha  why  would  the  majority  of  white  people  who  by nature  and I'm  not talking  about the  younger  generation  who I like  to call  the  wigger  would sit  there and enjoy  some of this  stuff  although I think  it's out of 
[02:08:00]  their demo  some of it  why would I  want to sit  and watch  this  people love  Aretha  I don't  like her  no no  no I'm  not even  talking about  just Aretha  your taste  is different  why do I  want to hear  Denzel Washington  give a speech  why do I  want to hear  Beyonce  why do I  want to hear  anybody else  a lot of  white people  would love  to hear  Springsteen  or Bono  or Mellencamp  is Bono  singing  or  Sean Crowe  is you two  performing  it just says  it says plus  so I don't 
[02:08:30]  know  Bono would  have to  I'm thinking  I don't know  I just see it  as something  that is not  all for one  I think this  is for  black people  I see this  as  you know  whatever  just call it  what it is  this is an  inauguration  of a  black president  so it's  for black  people  just be  honest  and say  it  this is not  going to be  an entertainment  thing where  white America 
[02:09:00]  is going to  sit down  in front of  their televisions  watch this  and be  entertained  white America  will sit down  watch this  and feel  alienated  you know  other inaugurations  haven't been  Super Bowl  halftime shows  they've been  bar fests  of just  the president  being inaugurated  that's what  it's about  because it was  all white guy  but that's what  it's about  you just  guys  you don't even  let's spice it up  a little bit  I didn't even watch  those  let's spice it up  then spice it up  with some diversity  I think white people  will like this  where's Metallica 
[02:09:30]  they don't have  Terminator X  let Metallica play  what's wrong with that  alright we'll make a call  I'm tired of it  I'm tired of it  Bono Springsteen  Bono's gonna perform  one with Mary J. Blige  because they did a very  good version of that song  for my music lovers out there  an old U2 song  and then Mary J. Blige  did a little something  with it with Bono  and honestly  it was well received  my friend  maybe we should play that  as we leave  to bring everybody together  let's not  hey 
[02:10:00]  we're running out of time  we gotta do a little  speed round here  we started with Sam's  weird gay stuff  and I think we have  a primetime gossip  about that very subject  oh  see we started with this  we end with this kind of  there's a conflict of interest here  and then we got the Archie Bunker thing  that I'm gonna squeeze in  before we leave  please squeeze it in  we're back  and primetime gossip  has quite a scoop  coming out  of the O.B. and Anthony show  O.N.A. super producer  primetime Sam Roberts  has been partaking  in several man-on-man 
[02:10:30]  themed bits  on the air as of late  and after a dinner conversation  at his parents' house  Sam's girlfriend  found out everything  that was going on  I got in the door  and my mom said hello  and she goes  when you were giving  E-Rock that hickey today  it was just disgusting  so she sold you out  and Jess goes  what?  what?  but  as O.B. pointed out  that wasn't Sam's first  questionable act  I forget creepy gay kid  that was sweeping the nation  for about a day  yeah well 
[02:11:00]  I shouldn't have done that either  Sam was vehement  in his defense  of his heterosexuality  explaining that these  so-called gay acts  were a result  of peer pressure  but what could be causing  all this pressure?  we at PTG  have been informed  that down low  O.N.A. producer  E-Rock  has been behind the scenes  ordering Sam  to perform  sexual acts  telling him the quote  nose won't get you anywhere  in this business  Sam was so scared  of E-Rock's wrath  he wouldn't even 
[02:11:30]  sell him out to O.P.  you could have said no  any time you wanted  just stop asking me  to do things  however  in a surprising turn  of events  after some questioning  E-Rock's wall of lies  came tumbling down  like a house of cards  and due to his big mouth  his supposed  fiance  found out  that he is indeed  an undercover gay man  well somebody just  found out  what?  wait your fiance  didn't know  I haven't told her anything  she just found out  what could be next  for the show?  will E-Rock 
[02:12:00]  finally embrace  his homosexuality?  will Sam  be able to live  his life  as a normal  if not overly active  heterosexual?  stay tuned  as PTG  keeps you  in the know  very nice  good job  why Sam  talking about  Sam  yeah  a little weird  calls himself  a super producer  yeah  I love how he  kind of threw  a few little things  in there  to make himself  look better  apparently 
[02:12:30]  Metallica  will be  performing  playing  fade to black  when I got  gonna  whap  here's Archie  Bunker  I was watching  TV yesterday  sorry Angry Kirby  your joke bombed  they were doing  stuff on the  sitcom  and they played  this clip  from All in the Family  and it's Archie  talking about  the black president  or the lack  of a black president  you ain't got  a black president  Jefferson  cause God  ain't ready  for that yet  wait a second 
[02:13:00]  what?  that's right  God's gotta  try it out  first  try making  a black pope  when she ain't  done it  is that all  you can talk  about  whether black  man or white  man should be  president  well what do  you want to  talk about  little girl  how about  a woman  president  oh holy cow  a woman  president  Mr. Jefferson  this may come  as a big surprise  to you  but women  are much more  oppressed  than blacks 
[02:13:30]  I don't see  no ghetto  for women  what do you  call a kitchen  wow  leave the funny  to Archie  my god  how great  is that  if they brought  this back  I'd be  I'd be watching  sitcoms  every freaking  night of the week  but addressing  that real strife  like with affirmative  action even now  when you look at  how blacks are angry  they say it benefits  white women  more  there's like a  weird thing  when it comes  to women  and blacks  in a way  like we're  oppressed  glad I'm out  of that one  why you don't 
[02:14:00]  like either  I'm kidding  that was just  a dumb  Anthony's gay joke  we might have  reached our  court on the  gay thing  today  what great  social commentary  yes  and now what  do you get  with a sitcom  friends  nice sets  though  not overly  dressed  very believable  homes  yeah  like they  would afford  that fine  apartment  in New York  City  sure they  could  he's always  there's  an apartment  you can land  with a 727  and Travolta  could actually  kiss another man  before boarding  a plane 
[02:14:30]  in the back  in that apartment  move  a sitcom  that's not 15  years old  huh  could we bring up  a sitcom  that's not 15  years old  sure I can  how I met  your mother  is a  friends rip off  ah  oh is it  very much so  a bunch of  friends and they  go out with each  other and they  got all these  little cute  friend problems  instead of  discussing real  issues through  humor like  Mr. Bunker  did  try how I met  your mother  how I met  your mother  try 25 years  and no I'm  just talking about  friends you dummy  yeah friends 
[02:15:00]  and friends is  less than 10  years right  Seinfeld's last  episode was what  10 years ago  already  was it really  no I remember  talking about  friends when we  were on in  Boston  well they had a  good run  it was like 10  years I guess  wait Seinfeld  didn't end in  98  99 98  sure did Jimmy  it sure did  yeah  there goes your  life  may 14th  1998 was the  last  there you go  over 10 years  heading toward  wow  that started in  88 wow 
[02:15:30]  where'd that go  yeah you can tell  when you see some  of the earlier  Seinfeld you really  can like wow  kind of a mullet  80s doubt  yeah  he's wearing like  a giant turquoise  button down shirt  yeah all tucked in  with his tight jeans  you know  I'll tell you  this much  I'm so effing  done  with  with freaking  Cosby  is he even  what did he do  now  I forgot  Jay from  Florida  thank you  oh did you see  later in that  same show  when Cosby 
[02:16:00]  said all in the  family had no  redeeming qualities  wasn't a true  representation of  the American male  and didn't do  any real social  commentary  he couldn't have  said that  because Cosby  did I mean  the black lawyer  living with the  black doctor  I mean that's  obviously a  representation of  every  successful  experience we  have  kids  and  never got into  any real  real trouble  and he also  said that it  never taught  anyone anything  or sought to  teach anyone  anything  this is why  Cosby is an  ass  and I'm 
[02:16:30]  an A  he's overrated  and he's an  ass  if he really  said that  the parody  of how  ridiculous  racism  was  was  absolutely  what that  was  Norman Lear's  a flaming  liberal  that was  the message  of that  show is how  ridiculous  being bigot  it is  and if  stupid  could never  speak through  his act  Cosby  who had to  do that  Camille  made a  cake  and then  all of a  sudden  step out  of character  and say 
[02:17:00]  what he  wanted to  say  how about  talking on  stage  stupid  how about  that  wow  his audience  doesn't want  to hear that  he bugs me  step and fetch  it Cosby  and stop  keeping the  little rascals  to yourself  that's  that's an  urban legend  is it  can you get  the little  rascals  of course  you can  yeah  what a  realistic  show this  was  alright  let's get  the hell  out of  here  you have  a pudding 
[02:17:30]  a why  with a bunch  of  after it  all in the  family  never did  social commentary  compared to  that fluff  crap you  put out  did you like  good times  was that  social commentary  I doubt it  do yourselves a  favor get the  second season  of all in the  family  you'll enjoy  it immensely  hey let's  get out of  here  music marathon  time here  in New York  City  for all you  Jeff Beck  fans  very good  news  an entire  hour of  Jeff Beck  music is  about to  begin  don't make

[02:22:00]  is you know  we  that weather  is moving  this way  we are going  to get like  yeah  that  really  fucking  cold  shit  can I ask  you rock  when we're  going to  replay the  Paul McCartney  interview  because there's  a lot of  people very  bummed out  they missed  it yesterday  and that's  that's the  drag of  doing this  radio show  yesterday  was like  holy shit  all hell  broke loose  excitement  everywhere  got to talk  to just  a legend  probably  the biggest  name ever  on our  show  and today  we got 
[02:22:30]  Stalker  Patty  on the  bleacher  so you  know  that's  our life  and what  we live  I'm sure  they can go  to audible.com  but I'm  I'm sure  we'll replay  it maybe  this weekend  or something  right  speaking of  E-Rock  he spent  at least  an hour  cutting up  the Jeremy  Piven audio  thank god  we got  the Jeremy  Piven audio  is that  what he was  doing  I think  to go inside  the show  a little bit  could be fun  because Sam  was laughing  and everybody  else  where's Sam  where's that  sarcastic  motherfucker  because Jeremy 
[02:23:00]  Piven was on  Good Morning America  talking about his  what metal  poisoning  or mercury  poisoning  somehow he got  mercury poisoning  what the fuck  from Freddie  and then E-Rock  had to cut it  up for an hour  take us inside  this a little bit  Sam  what happened  well  Jeremy Piven  I don't know  it might be good  so I might be  you know  out of the loop  on this one  but Jeremy Piven  I guess there's  the big story  a couple weeks ago  that he wasn't  doing this play  that he's in anymore  because he said  he got sick  from eating fish  he got mercury  poisoning 
[02:23:30]  right right  so he was on  GMA  to give this  big exclusive  interview  where he would  talk about  getting mercury  poisoning  which I would  assume  he's just going  to say  he got sick  he's not going  to come on  and say  he was lying  yeah  so  why doesn't  he talk  about the  positive  stuff that  happens  of mercury  poisoning  yeah  you see  the fucking  head of hair  he's got  now  yeah  maybe that  did it  I think  it was  the mercury  and no  follicles  he had nothing  in it  but the next  thing you know  he's got  a fine  hairline  and a lot  of hair 
[02:24:00]  it's the  mercury  so basically  Steve came  in and said  you know  this is important  we got to  do this  Jeremy Piven  is going to  be on GMA  yeah  and he put  E-Rock on it  yeah  so  E-Rock  and Steve  then crowded  around the TV  yeah  and they're  watching it  on the big  screen live  because the  source we used  to get audio  there's a little  delay  so you watch  it live  and then you  remember the audio  and go back  and cut it up  sure  so  the first  incident  was  while 
[02:24:30]  Eric  was watching  the live  screen  yeah  Steve went  back into  his office  and then he  came out  and said  hey Eric  could you  get this  audio  and Eric  goes  yes Steve  that's why  I'm watching  it  and then  Steve goes  okay  just reminding  you  and then Eric  kicked a chair  across the room  oh  E-Rock got a little  feisty  it gets heated  around here  yeah it sure does  and what was the  other thing  about  Jeremy Piven  starts talking 
[02:25:00]  about how  sick he was  yeah  and Steve  goes over  to the TV  and he goes  this guy says  he's sick  I don't believe  a word of it  uh oh  which given  why is that funny  yeah Sam  because given  the fact that  he's talking  a pot kettle  conversation here  clear non-nasally  voiced Steve  was out with  the cold  for one day  this week  where's Steve  non-nasally  boy  I love  the non-nasally  voice  oh no  and maybe  that person  walked out  of the office 
[02:25:30]  right as a  garbage can  was being  kicked  right at him  yeah  Steve  Steve  I don't like  this  very suspicious  that you did  not have a cold  I don't like  when you called  it sick  a couple days ago  I don't like  defend yourself  I love how  Sam fabricates  uh  sentence fragments  just to get him  just to instigate  ooh  what did I fabricate  that was  fabricated  said what  I didn't say  Pivens didn't  sound sick  you didn't  look at the TV  and say  I don't believe  him for a second  yeah you kind of  blocked me  from watching  and making  notes of this 
[02:26:00]  interview that I  had to cut up  because you stood  right in front of it  and turned the  remote down  just so you could  hear it  because the show  was playing  behind you  did you believe  he was sick  and not believe  he ate fish  I was watching  the show  but I don't know  whatever  um  anyway  he was asking  you a question  you can't just  say whatever  he just said  I fabricated  something  whatever  I have limited  space to allocate  this stupid shit  but you didn't  um  what  he asked you a  question  he didn't  make any sense  Steve comment 
[02:26:30]  I don't even  know what  Steve we're on  um  I thought the  Piven audio  was worth playing  so I had Eric  cut it out  right  so  I don't think  Anthony's getting  a cold  but then you  said I lied  when you  didn't say  that though  you didn't  look at the  TV and say  I don't believe  a word that  he's saying  verbatim  no I didn't  say that  but you were  saying that  Sam is telling  the truth  you kind of  just came in  and said  Sam fabricated  all the stuff 
[02:27:00]  and you're  saying  Sam said  this to you  and you're  saying he's  lying when he  said it right  to you  no he didn't  Steve I was  in the office  oh Jesus  you stood  in front of  me while I  was watching  and taking  notes on it  so you could  listen to him  talk about  being sick  I said I  believe you  I probably  said he's  disingenuous  or something  like that  but I  didn't say  verbatim  I do not  believe a word  of what he's  saying  I know  that  maybe I  did  I don't  remember  saying it  as soon  as you  said that  I am 
[02:27:30]  Danny  and was  like  Steve just  said this  lol  and then Danny  lol's back  but I  wouldn't have  made it  lol's back  if you were  loling about  it  if someone  intercepted  that conversation  they'd probably  go what are  these two  fat girls  talking about  exactly  it's like  the fucking  coffee clutch  that exists  behind the  scenes in  this place  it's so  silly  what coffee  clutch  you  Danny  Sam  Aaron  you mean  the entire  support staff  minus you  yes  exactly  the trials  and tribulations  of being the 
[02:28:00]  fucking  kindergarten  teacher  of romper  room  behind the  scenes  I don't  mind  but that's  the reality  of it  I have to  be the  fucking  nanny  of this  fucking  we were laughing  because  you were  talking to  a television  so what  and then you  turned around  like you had  just addressed  the room  I sure  showed that  Piven  what like  you've never  talked to a  TV and  discussed  before  yeah but  when I 
[02:28:30]  do it  it's not  the irony  isn't so  in my  face  of me  saying  you're  faking  sick  when there  was  suspicion  oh you  thought I  was  faking  sick  the other  day  no I  just said  suspicion  I did  not make  that claim  we don't  know for  sure  but  you did  say you  were going  to battle  a cold  yes  I was  doing  battle  it was  me  and a  saber  and  flu  germs  wait did  you have  a cold  this week  yeah my  chick's  been home  sick  with a cold  the entire  week  now you  check 
[02:29:00]  you  cause  Monday  you were  sweating  a lot  and then  Tuesday  you're  sweating  right now  and it's  17 degrees  out  I sweat  all the  time  I sweat  all the  time  I still  got my  hoodie on  and stuff  I'm still  a little  chilled  it is what  it is  I sweat  I know  and I'm not  on any  supplements  I'm not  on anything  and you  fought a  one day  cold  that's what  Sam's  getting at  right Sam  he said  going to  stay here  and try to  get rid 
[02:29:30]  of this  cold  which I  mean we  just thought  it was  funny  because  that was  the first  sentence  but this  cold  hadn't been  set up  like nobody  knew what  this cold  was because  he didn't  have a  cold on  Monday  oh  Jesus  okay  I had one  of those  24 hour  things  that was  you know  they happen  oh  okay  yeah  that's all  getting rid  of  I got rid  of it  but Sam  what are you  getting at  like colds  usually last  more than  right  well they're  like a 
[02:30:00]  what's the  average cold  I'd say  seven to  ten days  of lingering  plus  Sam  I'm gonna  make an effort  to breathe  on you  all week  the rest  of the week  alright  well maybe  I'll just  catch it  at three  in the morning  and then  be done  with it  by you know  noon  and then  it'll be  good  I hope so  thank you  Sam  see what's  happening here  is they  don't believe  you called  the six  I don't  give a rat  that's what  they believe  yeah people  are thinking  you were  fibbing  this is the  face of someone  who doesn't  give a shit  what they think 
[02:30:30]  oh that's great  oh that's great  right  wow  it's not  productive  the face  of someone  who doesn't  give a shit  that helps  the show  doesn't it  yes it does  actually  because if I  allow everything  that you guys  say to stress  me out  which I used  to but I  can't  I would  probably blow  my head off  clean across  the fucking  room but I  can't do that  so  what's the big  change where  you don't care  anymore  um  therapy  therapy  I mean therapy  yeah  does help  right  yeah it does  how's it  event  man or woman  man 
[02:31:00]  I can't  open up  to a man  sex cock  just can't  that was a good  one Steve  you gotta give it  to Danny  I will  I'll give it  that was a damn  good one  I didn't  the fact that  you delivered it  like I've never  seen a more eager  delivery in my life  but it was  a good one  I always have to  have a woman  yeah  alright  alright so we got  to the bottom  of the one day  cold  thank god  yeah  I was wrong  huh  I was wrong  thank you Sam  Steve had a cold  for six hours  I didn't apologize 
[02:31:30]  I was wrong  so is the Jeremy  Piven audio  worth playing  E-Rock  it's okay  he's just a whiny  douchebag  yeah  oh don't talk  about Steve  like that  yeah  he has to  leave the studio  for a second  what  could you leave  the studio  for a second  oh  but I'll hear it  out there  why do you want  to leave the studio  yeah  stay in front of  his face  right there  stay right in front  of that  the wettest face  on the fucking  east coast  oh my god  I know dude  that's bad  Steve you're dripping  on your shirt  I know  I don't know why  Eric you implying 
[02:32:00]  that Steve wouldn't  hear when he leaves  the studio would mean  that he doesn't  listen to this show  when he's texting  to do  oh jeez  that is what you  were implying  yeah Eric's  very upset  very emotionally  he's very upset  I don't understand  why  well there was  a couple of  things today  Steve  is this why  you wanted to  leave the studio  not necessarily  your fault  but the way  you handled it  could have been  done better  this morning  guys were talking  about we should  have had the  con clip  for Ricardo  Montalban's death 
[02:32:30]  I spent  the good portion  of that morning  trying to find  a computer  that would play  the DVD  because we  brought in  Rathacon  and three  different computers  had problems  reading it  or recording it  so I go  Steve  what am I  supposed to do  we can't  pull this  oh send me  an email  and we'll  take care of it  how does that  get it on the air  because  I had to go  I pulled the clip  off the fucking  YouTube  I had to find it  but you pulled  the one drop  where you yelled  con  I understand it  and also referenced  the funeral  that would have  been good to have 
[02:33:00]  and the part  about putting  the insects  I can't fix  those computers  dude  I can't  what would you  like me to do  find one that  worked  I don't think  any of them  fucking work  that's the problem  sending an email  and not getting  the audio  for that  particular segment  doesn't help  would you like me to  magically extract  the audio  from the DVD  I can't do it  you can use a  computer  you don't have to  use magic  thanks  very constructive  if we don't have  a computer that works  I have to get it  documented  and I have to  send it off  to somebody  hold your thought  because Sean 
[02:33:30]  in Jersey  once in  Sean yes  yes  if Steve's girl  has been sick  for a while  and he got the cold  from his girl  how from the same strain  is his a 24 hour cold  oh if she's been sick  for a while  that's a good one  I have a very resilient  immune system  Steve you just gotta  no one gives a shit  if people take a day  here and there  but you can't use  the cold excuse  and then come in  the next day  without a sniffle  I have  because then you're  playing right into  these guys' hands  I play right into  everybody's hands 
[02:34:00]  every day  it's simply a matter  of which way  the fucking wind  is blowing  most of us  don't know much  about medical crap  but we do know  a cold is a good  7 to 10 days easy  yeah  or at least 2  almost every single time  or at least 2  at least 2  back to you  rock  so there was that issue  and the  Jeremy Piven audio  some brain had come in  and said  hey they're gonna have  Jeremy Piven coming up  on Good Morning America  can you watch it  and you know  see if we can use it  yeah  because Mike and I  have been talking about it  up to that point  okay but Mike came 
[02:34:30]  and approached me  about this  so they go through  commercials  it comes on  I'm watching the interview  I'm taking notes  you show up  out of nowhere  and go  hey we should get  this audio  as I'm standing  by the television  watching and listening  to it  and then I go  I'm doing that  right now Steve  and you looked at me  and then just kind of  rolled back into the office  then you came back out  towards the end  of the interview  stood in front of me  got real close  to the television  and was watching  in awe as he was  talking about  how he was sick  what's the problem  with that  I was doing something 
[02:35:00]  what the fuck  were you doing  taking notes  for the interview  and me standing  in front of you  prevents that  your ears shut off  when I stand in front of you  you took the remote  you stood over there  and was adjusting  the volume  while I was sitting  at the desk  I didn't touch the remote  Steve you did  no I didn't  the volume went down  on the television  and you went closer to it  and all I'm hearing  is the show  instead of the interview  I didn't do that  it's a brilliant strategy  just to deny everything  he was turning down  the volume  so he could win  his argument  with Jeremy Pitten  Piven and I  were engaged 
[02:35:30]  in a heated debate  and I had to get  my point across  ok but you could have  waited until I was  done taking the notes  Mr. Piven is a busy man  and I had to win  the argument  ok but there was  a show going on  and I needed to cut  the interview off  it was on a tight schedule  it's on TV Steve  it was a one way  conversation  you can't have  a two way conversation  with the television  it was real  everybody knows that  even if you're sick  it was real  it was just frustration  Steve  it was real  so do we play  any of these  Jeremy Piven clips  he just sounds like  I think now we have to  kind of play at least 
[02:36:00]  one or two  really  just so we know  what the whole  to do is about  yeah  what are the best ones  I don't know  let's uh  we'll start with this  Mercury Piven  too much  fish  sushi  depends here  what is it  is it true  it is true  and I felt the same way  I had no reference  for it whatsoever  the first week of rehearsal  I started feeling  a certain kind of fatigue  I had no reference for  I went to the doctor  he tested everything 
[02:36:30]  he said there's nothing wrong  with you  we're going to get  your heavy metals in  they came back  they were six times  what the average person has  heavy metals  yeah he's got some  he just  you know  was  wanted out of Broadway  you think  yes  should have said  he had a cold for a day  would have gotten him  out of one performance though  Mercury gets you out of  a lot  I have Mercury poisoning  you should buy a Blackberry  why is that Sam? 
[02:37:00]  because I really don't understand  what you're getting at  what would that be Sam?  I don't know  I know people  I'm not going to mention any names  but  there are people  who use their Blackberry  to get out of like  the responsibilities  of their job  yeah  how would they do that?  that sounds crazy  they could scroll through it  they could look for  pretend emails  and stuff like that  some people  I don't know  pretend  oh my dear  sweet Jesus 
[02:37:30]  some people  I don't know  right  yeah  more Jeremy Piven  so it's just fatigue  other things  at one point  you were talking about  not being able to  remember the lines  what other things  so at the beginning  that's what it was  and it progressed  to the point  where that final Sunday  I had problems  spatially  I was losing  my balance  and my memory  the lights  were too bright  I couldn't get  enough oxygen  I ended up  kind of passing out  in my place  when I got home  I ended up  in the hospital  for three days  is this a real thing? 
[02:38:00]  let's get Dr. Steve  on the phone  does he know anything  about the Mercury Piven  he's never been there  you gotta be careful  how much sushi  do you have to eat  to get this Mercury thing?  don't worry  I heard it  was it good?  I didn't know  he was talking about me  and my trip to Bombtown  Bombtown  Bombtown  you guys want Steve  to leave now?  because he's not  going to leave  unless you guys  are done beating him up  I wasn't beating up Steve 
[02:38:30]  just saying  are you rocking  the girls dad?  no I was just  pointing out the obvious  well how come  I feel like you  are a little mean to Steve  yeah why so mean to Steve?  just a frustrating morning  stuff wasn't working  people standing in the way  of doing  what you were supposed  to be doing  and then tell you  you should be doing  what you were supposed  to be doing  don't call Steve stuff  oh  stuff  yeah  well  alright  Steve go mop up  thank you  what is that about? 
[02:39:00]  come on  oh Jesus  you're among friends  you can talk  what are you doing  you're among friends  what are you doing  for real  if I was on the supplements  I'd say it  but I'm not  this is fun  little like  let's make fun of Steve  but that is a real thing  going on  no one sweats like that  your hair is wet  Roland used to  that's true  Roland did used to  sweat  yeah but this is a new  thing with him  Roland always sweated  Roland always looked like  he was in a customs line  with something shoved  in his ass  what are you on 
[02:39:30]  nothing  nothing  this is  if I had to guess  a byproduct of that  surgery I have  it's just  my body just  doesn't process  I know  but it doesn't go away  my stomach is still  I've never seen you  sweat like this  ever  even in the summer  my friend  even in the summer  I wish I could tell you  I wish I could tell you  but the honest  the god truth is  I'm not on any  pills or supplements  or anything  and I just  all the time  do you have a cold?  yes I do  thank you for asking  maybe it's a fever  might be a cold  yes I'm very feverish  thank you sir 
[02:40:00]  oh wait it's gone  it's ready to drip again  I know  and it happens all the time  and I don't know why  except for  you look like  Gary Glitter at his sentencing  did he do something wrong?  not in my eyes  thank you  alright  are we attempting  to make something  out of this Jeremy Piven thing?  how much fish  were you eating?  well I mean  it's an extraordinary case  because the reality  is the only protein  I got for 20 years  was from fish  I kind of thought 
[02:40:30]  I was doing the right thing  and as a result  is it sushi?  is it raw fish?  you know this is  unfortunately  it was any kind of fish  I thought I was being healthy  you know  because I figured  out of all the meats  fish would be the best  and these unregulated  Chinese supplements  were you doing a lot of this?  no not a lot of Chinese herbs  I'm just  I'm a very clean person  I kind of grew up  macro psychotic  macro biotic  I call it  macro psychotic  so I don't really  do western medicine  in terms of  I haven't had much aspirin  in my life  so when I would get a cold 
[02:41:00]  I would take a few Chinese herbs  I don't think that's a variable  alright this dish  is pulling me in  now I want to hear more  this guy is like  20 years  not just sushi  right  like every kind of fish  right  where's he getting  his fucking fish?  probably from the hospital  like right off  Three Mile Island  right  the East River  yeah  what the fuck  how much mercury is  have you eaten so much sushi  they can say you can  I think salmon  but he's saying 
[02:41:30]  everything cooked fish  half of Hollywood  would be fucked up  that's all these people eat  20 years  he got all his protein  off of fish  right  right  and now he's a  fucking  full of mercury  the rap on you  is that you're out  at clubs at night  that you're bored  with the show  partying  all this  let's be really clear  David Mamet  is one of the greatest  I really do feel like  I'm listening to Steve though  anyone hear like  the similarities here?  there's a little Steve-ism  it's not crazy  that the guy had  mercury poison though 
[02:42:00]  to be honest  I've heard of the  mercury poison thing  and what happened?  he was sick  his name is Thurm  and he got sick  for a while  oh  what's his last name?  I don't want to say  no  now you have to  you have to  oh you have to say it now  we want to know  what Thurm's last name is  Munson  no  if you say  on the roof  of course it is 
[02:42:30]  no no  his last name was  Mitter  and his middle name  is Oscar  so  Thurm  all  Mitter  here's a friend of mine  I was hoping  Thurm might get something  and I could walk away  with only half a dick  I wanted to hear  I wanted to hear  the other half  I wanted to let the horse  to slam it all home  E-Rock's back  yes E-Rock  that line comes up  a little later  in this interview  what?  the thermometer line  oh really?  for real? 
[02:43:00]  yeah  that's all we know  about fucking Mercury  is you know  that you were  that big stretch  that you were bored  with the show  partying  let's be really clear  David Mammon  is one of the greatest  American playwrights  it is my dream  to be on Broadway  I was living my dream  we had brilliant reviews  we were sold out  every night  this was the greatest  time of my life  I would have loved  to go out  I couldn't do it  my body was fighting  this Mercury toxicity  to the point where 
[02:43:30]  if I had a glass of red wine  it was too much  I think it makes  for a great story  to be honest with  yeah do you  wait wait  if you had a  glass of red wine  because of the Mercury  start blacking out  what the fuck  yeah stop  I've never heard of this  I have not either  I know I'm an entourage man  but ugh  every time I see this guy  yuck  I'm trying to pump  someone's line up  a little bit  Steve also had 
[02:44:00]  Mercury poisoning  Freddy Mercury poisoning  Stig from Wagbag  yeah but what about  your fellow  castmates there  and David Mamet  saying that you're  leaving to become  a thermometer  he's a brilliant  playwright  and it's a great line  you know it really is  it's a very funny line  I couldn't make it  through the show  the third day  in the hospital  Dr. Robert Starr  he goes to the  school of Steve 
[02:44:30]  yeah  yes  very vague  very  what happened  to 9000  what happened  to 9000  it's gone  what are we down  we might  go under 8 today  we were bragging  like look at this  we're healthy  we're going to hit  9000  stay over 9 G's  for a while  because just when  people start getting  the slightest bit  of confidence  to go back in  some expert  has to blurt out  something horrid 
[02:45:00]  and make everyone  sell  I think the  unemployment numbers  come out  and they're bad  and of course  they were  this just in  Steve Jobs  just lost  two more pounds  who's a cardiologist  of 27 years  at Yale  said you have  a resting heart  rate at 47  your body  is  desperately  trying to catch up  what I'm going to say  to you Jeremy  is enforced rest  you don't want  to have a heart attack  and when a cardiologist  says this to you  you don't quite know  what to do  you're sitting  in a hospital bed  you can either  go against  doctor's orders 
[02:45:30]  or  you can listen  to the three  different doctors  that we're  in the hospital  with  that's an odd  cut  well that's  probably when  Iraq was  distracted by  Steve  right Iraq  yeah  you guys hold  back  a little bit  yeah  should we  continue with  this  he just  obviously  he's constantly  covering his ass  to this  obviously  he would lose 
[02:46:00]  a lot of money  if he just said  I just don't feel  like doing your  stupid play anymore  so he's got to  come up with  something that  they can't argue  and sue him over  right  yeah  like he has a  comfort  who's always  covering his ass  Iraq  oh and Jeremy  Piven too  did you meet  Steve  yeah  oh man  why'd you tell him  that was a really  enjoyable sound  was that you  I thought somebody  was opening  fruit roll ups  Iraq was chewing gum  it was the worst  gum  it was not like  the joker 
[02:46:30]  yawning  yeah  Piven calls the show  it's profitability  do we play that  do we play  went through  controversial  chelating  something like that  treatment  chelating  chelation  or something like that  it's where it's  detoxing the blood  oh yeah yeah yeah  chelation  yeah  I'm kidding  you have no idea  no  explains his background  oversells his condition  again and finally  Jeremy pleads for you  to get your medals checked  yeah  oh thanks  let's go to this  all right  Jeremy Piven  has spoken 
[02:47:00]  this morning  get your heavy medals  tested  please  I beg you guys  go to bluevoice.org  you'll learn more  information about all this  and it's much bigger  than me  it really is  we're polluting  our food source  and it's not a great  thing that's going on  thank you  why do you have to  make it a public  service now  I would encourage  people to eat  more fish  yeah  the over dramatics  is definitely  Steve C-isms  yes  heavy medals  yes  and if he's better now  can't he just go back  to the play  isn't the play still around 
[02:47:30]  they replaced him  with who  somebody  he rocked his microphone  there for a reason  somebody  not a bigger name  it's just  I guess his understudy  replaced him  in the  in the performance  wouldn't they put him  back in or would the  understudy just  set the world on fire  no they're actually  suing him  I think  trying to  cut some of the  money from it  yeah  okay  there you go  that was exciting  we're going to  take a quick break  oh you rock  when are we  replaying the  Paul McCartney  interview for the  people that missed 
[02:48:00]  it yesterday  we're going to  replay three times  over the weekend  alright very good  just  8 o'clock  right before the  Saturday Night Virus  we're going to  put it on there  okay very good  Opie and Anthony  stay there  yeah yeah yeah  Opie and Anthony  hi  well someone has  to officially say  it  snow day  snow day  we're in the middle  of a snow day  yeah  unfortunately the  snow started before 
[02:48:30]  we came to work  today so we might  go half day today  you know how some  of the schools go  half day  yes we'll announce  our the radio  closings for the day  radio show closings  radio show closings  I can tell you this  much Ron and Fez  are closed today  closed today  yeah radio show  closings  Ron and Fez are  closed today  what other shows  are closed today  what other shows  we got that are  closed today  Rush Limbaugh  Hannity 
[02:49:00]  what  Hannity  Ron and Fez  were very funny  yesterday and  no of course  they'll be here  today  they're making  fun of our  Paul McCartney  interview at first  I was a little  pissed off but  then they really  had a fine little  take on that  whole thing  yeah  yeah because  they were kind  of jealous that  we got Paul  McCartney and  they didn't  because you know  there's a lot of  Beatles fans  on that show  they had Eastside  Dave making  believe he was  Paul McCartney  and every time  Sir Paul entered 
[02:49:30]  the studio they  would hit the  jet song that  Mr. McCartney  did with wings  yes  very funny bit  so they took  a negative  because they  were frustrated  we got the  booking and  they made it  into some good  radio yesterday  jealousy though  yeah a little  jealous  it's alright  though  I didn't get  to listen to  him  I had a  wow  I did some  battling on  the way home  yesterday  with a van  a white van  nice  some construction 
[02:50:00]  van  I don't know  what it was  but he's in  the left lane  obviously on a  cell phone  so he wasn't  moving very fast  and I finally  have to work  my way around  him  I get around  him and I  gotta cut  in front of  him  because I'm  coming up  pretty fast  on the car  in the middle  lane  so now  if you're  on the left  lane  I'm gonna  cut right  in front  of you  you're the  one that  shouldn't be  there  so I cut  in front  of him  and I  speed off  I flip  in the finger  too  as I'm  going by  and I 
[02:50:30]  speed off  come over  a hill  and just  dead stop  traffic  so now  I'm like  yeah  yeah  god damn  you're right  so I  come over  the hill  dead stop  traffic  and now  the motherfucker  pulls next  to me  and starts  cursing me  out  starts battling  yeah we  start battling  and then  he's  taking his  van  and pulling  it closer  to me  so I  take the  escalate 
[02:51:00]  and I  wham  my wheel  over  and get  within like  an inch  or two  of him  and he  wings out  of the way  now we're  like  we're  taunting  each other  with our  trucks  and uh  I  the traffic  opens up  so I  take off  now he's  trying to  keep up  with me  which is  futile  futile  I get  slowed  down by  traffic  again  he comes  up next  to me  I roll  the window  down  he rolls  his down  and he's  yelling  fuck you  fuck you  and I go  listen  you  savage 
[02:51:30]  you  fucking  savage  you  probably  got  a bomb  in there  don't  you  oh was  I being  just uh  uh  I was being  American  yourself  being myself  I was being  me  but I was  so pissed  off at this  guy  and then he  came way  over on me  where I had  to really  jerk the  wheel to get  out of the  way of him  and then I  came back  over on him  and he's  so we're  weaving back  and forth  this is on  Long Island  Expressway  by the way  what would  it take  for you  to do  a little  tap  in  a little  NASCAR  I  I was  dude  I was  very close 
[02:52:00]  trade a  little paint  trade a  little paint  sue me  you know  what I was  gonna do  I was  gonna just  look at  the stupid  name of  this fucking  company  that this  rag is  working for  and buy  the  call it  up  buy the  company  and fire  them  exactly  or call  them up  and report  them as a  fucking  horrid  driver  who was  throwing  shit  no  you know  why  because I'd  been in  that boat  I was being  a nice  guy  see how  nice I  was  but I  could have  I could  have fucking  just  rammed  him off  the road  I wanted

[02:53:00]  yeah  what are  you  gonna do  go up  and unlock  the gun  closet  he's  not gonna  pull a gun  on me  and be able  to shoot me  before I can  fucking  whale my vehicle  into him  you got a secret  trap in your  escalator  no no trap  come on  I got nothing  like that  I got my wits  about me  and I have  I have  where I  prepare for  these things  so I knew  if he pulled  out any kind  of weapon  he ain't  getting a  shot off  before he's  got a  headlight  in his  mouth  listen to  the way  you're  talking  yes  you have  a great  job

[02:59:30]  how  it's  supposed  to  work  here's  worst  scenario  ever  ever  when  they  close  the  fucking  right  lane  and  everyone's  got to  merge  over  into  the  middle  and  left  lanes  and  then  when  you  get  past  the  blockage  and  the  right  lane  opens  up  again  the  idiots  forget  to  get  out  of  the  left  lane  and  continue  doing  the  speed  they  were  doing  like  in  the  right  lane  they  don't  know  the  rules  these  people  don't  know  the  rules  you  don't  fucking  stay  in  that  left  lane  when 
[03:00:00]  there  is  a  parade  behind  you  of  people  looking  to  go  faster  if  the  road  is  clear  in  front  of  you  and  there's  a  fuckload  of  traffic  behind  you  you're  a  problem  and  that  causes  more  accidents  I  would  have  to  know  shit  cause  you  gotta  weave  around  those  really  slow  people  that  are  not  getting  out  of  the  way  you  gotta  start  weaving  around  them  now  you're  changing  lanes  when  you  shouldn't  have  to  and  you  can't  time  when  you're  gonna  cut  into  the  next  lane  cause  you're  too  slow  now  because  of  this  asshole  you gotta  look  and go  alright  is there  gonna be  enough  room 
[03:00:30]  by the  time  I  get  there  to  get  in  between  the  guy  in  the  middle  and  right  lane  and  get  around  this  guy  we  got  a  man  call  alright  meaning  you know  you gotta  blank  man  alright  Mikey  help me  out  Mikey  Mike  Mike  in  Philly  it  says  you gotta  stay  cool  man  stay  cool  are you  there  bro  I guess  not  by the  way  you know  who are  bad drivers  I hate  to say  it  black  females  not  fast 
[03:01:00]  not  speedy  what are you  talking about  black men  are not  fast  drivers  white  men  god damn  it  it's just  something  we do  well  it's  a  challenge  when I'm  out there  I look  at least  8 vehicles  ahead of me  to see  what's  going on  is it  slowing  down  when I  see  brake  lights  and the  lanes  are  slowing  down  I'll  look  and see  beyond  where  it's  first 
[03:01:30]  stopped  which  lane  is  moving  and  then  get  into  that  lane  so  even  if  you  got  to slow  down  you're  moving  there's  like  you  got  to  drive  like  people  drive  like  they're  just  fucking  we got  we got  brother  Joe  on the  line  Joe  this is  no time  for a  2U plug  please  no no no  it's not a 2U plug  me and Anthony  have had this discussion  before  I just took a  driver's education  course to  knock 4 points  off my life  I was maxed  I was maxed out  to like 9 points  wow  and I was sitting 
[03:02:00]  there with  just the usual  suspects  the same  assholes  that are in the  left  fucking lane  that won't move  over  and I actually  discussed it with  them  but you know  what the thing is  to do  you can't get  yourself in  trouble  you really can't  you lean on the  horn  you get behind  them  it's pretty safe  following distance  and stay on your  horn  until they  fucking move  over  that's it  all you do is  just do not  stop  leaning on the  horn  oh that's a good one  eventually they get  eventually they're like 
[03:02:30]  this guy's not gonna  quit  and they have  to move  there's no  fucking way they  can handle  having a horn  blast them  behind them  the problem is  Joe they'll  understand that  he's too  legit to do  so  that's when  you're a radio  gangster  let me give you  a little vengeance  too  a little vengeance  once you do  look at him  give him the  finger  give him the  look  whatever  and then get  in front of  him  take your  driver's side  tires 
[03:03:00]  and zip  into those  you know  the  you're falling  asleep grooves  on the left  side  right before  the median  wall  get your tires  in there  in front of  the guy  that you just  passed  it will kick  rocks  fucking  hubcaps  dirt  everything  will fly  into this  guy's  windshield  and he  he won't  try to  follow you  then  having the  guy behind  you with  the brights  on at 
[03:03:30]  night  they don't  know better  than to  shut their  fucking  brights  off  I adjust  my  side  view  mirror  to blow  it right  back  into their  fucking  eyes  that's a  good one  that is  a good  oh I gotta  remember  that one  that works  all the  time  there are  people that  don't  they just  don't  understand  and  I know  if I'm  in the  left lane  and I'm  there are  people that  don't look  in their  mirrors  I guess  like I'm  constantly  looking in  my mirrors  for police  but a  peripheral  thing  is that I 
[03:04:00]  also notice  other people  so if  somebody's  coming up  on me  and I'm  noticing I'm  in the  left lane  and someone  is at  speed  and they're  gonna pass  me  I move  the fuck  over  and I give  them plenty  of time  where I  move over  and they  pass me  and then I  get back  in  I'm fine  I'm not  gonna be  the dick  right  fucking  asshole  attaboy  by the way  I'll be  driving that  way  on the  way  to the  performing  arts  center  on  February  13th  nice  to do  the  video  screen

[03:05:00]  I know  but I'm trying to remember his website  not2u  I think it's  2u.com  notu2  notu2.com  notu2.com  I don't know  just look up  just put  to you  tribute  oh Gregorio  I get so frustrated  I want to try something today  um  success  yes you burped  stalker patty  is on the bleachers  now  last time she was here 
[03:05:30]  she was screaming  bloody murder  for her life  and it's now part of the intro  to this fine radio show  for the last couple of weeks  that was a good one  now hear me out  I want to like  maybe do some nice  nice radio  with patty today  I listen to Ron and Fez  she's singing nice Christmas songs  everyone gets along  did you notice she sang that  why don't we take a page  from the Ron and Fez book  and see if patty  can maybe do something  where we're actually like  wow patty  who knew  did you notice that  that she sang  um  Santa Baby  to Fezzy 
[03:06:00]  Fezzy Baby  for Christmas  yeah  and um  the next day  Eartha Kitt  who made the song famous  died  you killed Eartha Kitt  with your lousy rendition  patty  what could you do  for us today  for real  where we leave you alone  we don't throw liquid shit  on you  or try to cut your hair  what does Ron and Fez do  like that  makes  that's fun  yet entertaining  for the listeners  right  once in a while  they'll just ask my opinion 
[03:06:30]  on something  and whatever  but who cares about that  I know  we should do that  we should try to do something  a little different  alright  we can do that  we kind of want  some of our guys back  we want all our guys  to Ron and Fez  because you know  stupid me  they treat them  like human beings  over there  fucking Big A  has theme songs now  and scheduled bits  I'm like  they started on our show  remember that  we want some of our guys back  the big Philly motorcycle run  was his first appearance  and now  now he's on the R&F team  right  patty 
[03:07:00]  if she wants to talk about something  something relevant  that we've been talking about  the election  the inauguration  the energy  the excitement  all that  maybe she's got an opinion  there's a big topic today  on the show  that's a good idea  that she would like to add in  patty  have you been keeping tabs on this  and how do you feel  about the upcoming inauguration  the feeling  do you think it's good  what's your opinion  well  I think that he seems like  he's going to be more  of a people's president 
[03:07:30]  he seems to have  feelings along that line  about  the people that he's  you know  looks like  he looks like he's going to be  the people's president  he really does  I think he wants to have  some kind of a stimulus  package  that he's going to send down  to New York  to help us keep the subway lines  and stuff  you know  what is his stimulus package  yeah  he's going to give money  to the NTA  you know  and  the NTA  doesn't need money  who said that 
[03:08:00]  yeah they do  and they're going to  up everybody's fucking  fares  by like three bucks  well it didn't happen yet  but I think that's  what he wants to do  you know  give some money  to New York  that's not giving money  to New York  that's giving money  to a company  that doesn't know  how to run  it's own fucking business  oh I know that  they make announcements  you can't even  understand them  so you have no idea  what's going on  when the trains  are held up  yeah she's kind of like  what was that  Joe the Plumber  she's like a regular person 
[03:08:30]  yeah regular regular Joe  can you imitate  Patty the toilet clogger  I want her to imitate  the announcement  she hears on the subway  because they can't fix  the speakers  right Patty  I can't understand them  because it's all static  how does it sound  Patty  I can't imitate static  static  static  static  guys  we're trying  to be an equal  to Patty  thumbs up by Patty 
[03:09:00]  that it Patty  yeah  that's exactly  what it sounds like  so we're like  what happened  so Patty  do the impression  yeah  how about  well  it doesn't like  even touching this stuff  I understand  how about you do the impression  into the mic  it just sounds like  like that  that's what it sounds like  they don't have a good set  PA system  I think it's outdated  you think that's the most  important thing  on the trains  sometimes yeah  when you're wondering  why it's taking so long  for the trains to move 
[03:09:30]  and you know  you've got somewhere to be  I would like to know  why we're being  held in the station  right  and they come on  and they tell you  and with a clear PA  you understand it  yeah  I'd like to know  what the situation is  because it's going to  change it right  yeah  when the train stops  like in the tunnel  and you're stuck there  what's the difference  if you know  or you don't know  oh good point  maybe I have somewhere  I have to be  and it makes me more  nervous about  having to be somewhere  where I have to be 
[03:10:00]  and then a lot of times  it's not going to change it though  what if you go  into the electric chair  you'd be happy to be like  no I think it's even funny  when you get to  Whitehall Street  to get off at the ferry  that they stop  in the middle of the tunnel  and it's five minutes  before the boat  and then by the time  they pull in  it's two minutes  after the boat left  you know where  you know where the information  you can get it  and this is a secret  so you know  keep it to yourself  step out of the train  there's two rails  that the wheels are on  but there's a third one  oh thank you 
[03:10:30]  that's where all  the electricity  and power is  you put your ear on it  and they tell you  someone whispers in your ear  it's going to be  five minutes  so just do that  and make sure your feet  are in water  when you do it  you get literal Patty  literal Patty  oh that's where  the power goes  through  of course  I know the third rail  not well enough  exactly  I'll have to push her  into it  hey hey  we're trying some  different things  oh shit  that's right  boy do I go  right for the throat  she reminds me  of Robert Shaw  although I wish 
[03:11:00]  she reminded me  of him in the  10 year column  one two three  great movie  sure was  Patty can you sing  a song for us  today  I was a little  jealous hearing you  sing on run of  Fez  she did a great  job with that  Fezzy Baby  song  she actually has  a very angelic  voice  really  yeah  Patty what song  did you sing for us  today  I don't know  it's just that  I'm not prepared  prepared  I had to go  online to YouTube  with the Santa  baby one 
[03:11:30]  and do it a couple  times with the  music there  and then I did it  with David  in the studio  and he recorded it  yeah  yeah  I know what  happened  I'm hearing a  buzzing in my ears  I'm hearing  I don't even know  what it is  I'm hearing subway  announcements  yeah  I'd rather hear  alright Patty  we're trying  I want Patty  to sing  I bet if she  sings something  I'll change her  tune a little bit  yeah  I learned that  we've known you  for 12 some odd 
[03:12:00]  years  and we don't know  anything about you  because we're too  busy like trying  to horrify you  yeah  goof on you  whatever  give you a heart  attack  hey Patty  maybe Seth Rogen  could bring the mic  in here  and you could  talk in here  come here Patty  hey Patty  here comes Patty  everybody  it's Patty  hi Patty  it's cool  you look good  standing straight  walking tall  I want to make  soup out of her  Patty why don't  you stand straight  anymore 
[03:12:30]  what  you don't stand  straight really  well I'm being  treated for arthritis  and stuff  and I have some  spinal degeneration  due to it  so I'm in physical  therapy once a week  for it  because I'm in pain  worst improver ever  Patty improv rules  how old are you  now 52  I'll be 54  in June  what the fuck  50 was just  yesterday  four more years  where you're not  using that snatch  of yours  relatively speaking 
[03:13:00]  that's not that  old to the point  where you should  start falling apart  like this  right  your calcium  is all fucked up  well I'm low  in vitamin D  I'm on 600 units  a day  I have to take  actinol once a month  I do the 30  you know the once  a month pill  if you had vitamin D  yeah she needs  she's longer  vitamin D  and I have to start  on B12 supplements  soon and I'm gonna  be on a multivitamin  that's very powerful  multivitamin  that's very powerful 
[03:13:30]  because for some  reason my vitamins  are not being  absorbed  but I eat well  you're just shitting  the pills out  whole Patty  I don't eat junk  either  vegetables  fish  and you know  yogurt  you don't eat beef  I don't like meat  no  I saw a video  you know  a PETA video  those are funny right  yeah well I saw  a guy stepping  on a cow's face  and the nose  was bleeding  and I was like  that's it  I can't eat meat  anymore  because I couldn't  deal with the video 
[03:14:00]  you see the one  where they take  the skin off  and it's still breathing  I saw all of it  I don't agree  with their tactics  but they did  find it  they did  found their company  on good principles  but not good tactics  you will tell us  when that cow  stops screaming  won't you  you don't agree  with their what  tactics  I don't like  the fact that  they walk into  people's stores  and mess them up  these people  trying to run  a business  to try to get 
[03:14:30]  a message  across  you can lobby  for laws  do you have  any tattoos  and stuff  you know  but not go  into people's  property  and destroy it  just because  they want to  make their point  that's not  the right approach  so what do you  say you don't  agree with what  I don't agree  with their approaches  yeah  what do you mean  by approaches  though  you don't walk  up to somebody  wearing a fur  and throw paint  on them  you don't go  into somebody's  Eve's Lorenz  shop  and destroy it  wait  but that is 
[03:15:00]  what do those  consider they're  what  you don't agree  with what  yeah  they're  they're what  they're tactics  t-a-c-t-i-c-s  maybe I don't  say it right  they're tactics  what did you say  Eve what  who  what's the designer  Eve St. Lorenz  yeah that's right  actually  they went into  a parish shop  and destroyed  the whole place  yeah  why do you agree  with that  I don't agree 
[03:15:30]  with that  that's the tactics  I don't agree  with  destroying people's  property  there's no reason  to do that  but you could go  down to your  government  and lobby for  laws  you know  to be amended  or changed  I'd rather  turn on the radio  and hear Stactic  than hear this  crap  yeah  but Patty  if you don't  agree what we  do to animals  then you should  be supporting  the people  that throw  the paint  and stuff  like that  no  I don't  support that  no  why are you  wearing fur boots  you fucking  animal 
[03:16:00]  haters  it's imitation  fur from  Palo's shoe  source  yeah but they  get that fur  from cats  no they don't  this is imitation  it's all imitation  perfect imitation  of awful radio  because you're not  eating meat  yeah that's a problem  you're falling apart  that's a problem  you need a little bit  of protein  from like  beef maybe  and you know  maybe that's like  a little propaganda  maybe they actually  treat the cows nice  but they found  one asshole  to do the right 
[03:16:30]  video  to scare  it  and one thing  I didn't understand  was that the guy  was filming a cow  going through that  why didn't he  throw the camera down  and beat the shit  out of him  why would you  hurt the cow  no beat the shit  out of the guy  hurting the cow  that's what I  would have done  I would have  kicked his ass  is this the video  you were looking at  no I didn't see  that particular one  it's funny  they're all having fun  these animals  are living high  on the hog  that's right  life O'Reilly  that's what I  saw something like 
[03:17:00]  that with the cow  instead of taking  pictures I would  have beat the shit  out of the guy  doing the stomping  oh wow  they just chopped  that head off  well you gotta club  him  keeps the meat tender  I don't understand  why people would  do that  it's still blinking  that's got a sting  if you're gonna  raise an animal  for consumption  put it down  in a humane way  yeah  they kind of like  slam dunked the 
[03:17:30]  animal right on  the dirt  ah here's leather  for the people  that don't just  eat meat but wear  leather  here's the cows  they're being  treated well right  now  no problem  this looks like  America too  doesn't it  you're looking at  a third world  fucking savage nation  why are they  showing this  we're doing that  in slaughterhouses  here  no they're not  they lull them  to sleep with music  no they don't  yes they do  then again  I saw another  video called  farms  had nothing 
[03:18:00]  to do with  Peter or any  animal protection  agency  and they were  raising them  humanely on the  farm  the best way  they found  to put a cow  down is to  just put a  bullet between  the eyes  and the cow  just goes down  it doesn't  feel anything  and they  raise it  well and  feed it  well and  take care of  it until  they're ready  to down  it  oh  they use that  they use that  thing like they  use on it  wow they're skinning  oh my god  that reminds me  when I went to  Chinatown and I  saw them carrying 
[03:18:30]  real pigs off the  truck and I had to  close my eyes  because I felt  sorry for the  pigs  aww  oh look they're  showing this  fucking  this uh  snipping the  dicks  yeah they're just  snipping the  dick off  I love Peter  I'm gonna fucking  join this  organization  because they  fucking throw  paint on people  good  yeah look  yeah they don't  kill animals  they just kill  the people  that kill  they should  these fucking  people should be  fucking killed  look at them all  with their bloody  heinies  stupid lambs  what did they do

[03:19:30]  to be killed  these people  need to be  fucking killed  I almost cried  when I saw  that pedal  when I was  in tears  look at these  fucking sacks of  shit  they should be  fucking killed  now we're  getting upset  let's uh  this is some  kind of savage  nation  it doesn't matter  it's the fact  we support it  look at them  cutting those  fucking things  arms off  while it's alive  yeah  the more  fucking pita  fucking throws  paint on people  the happier  compassionate  alternatives  what is that  I don't know  I can't imagine  pita has a  compassion  oh they're  showing like

[03:25:30]  foundling  and see if they'll  release those things  to me  the foundlings  this is better than  scary  do they have information  I don't know  yeah  why don't you dig up  your parents  and take a look  at their bodies  your fucking  what was your mother  a graham cracker  I also want to see  if there's a history  of heart problems  because my  I have my  terval prolapse  and my heart's  a little enlarged  and I'm on medication  for it  I gotta see  if they have  a history of that  I don't know  what hypopsidae means 
[03:26:00]  but that's what  it said on my  father's certificate  hypopsidae  I don't know  what it means  I have no idea  what the word means  yeah  why don't you  look it up  on the internet  yeah  I gotta wait  till tomorrow  to do that  why  well  because I  well  I don't want  to talk  come on  go  I don't discuss  any issues  that I have  Patty  talk about it  come on  come on  why do you have  to wait  till tomorrow  well  every once in a while 
[03:26:30]  I might be late  with my internet bill  they turn me off  and then within a week  I'm back on again  when I have money  to pay it  how much is your bill  well now I gotta  give them 127  so I'll do that  tomorrow  because I got  I took my personal  day  I added that  with the 7 hours  vacation  I'm entitled  to those hours  in addition  to my regular hours  so now I'll have  a paycheck  that's big enough  that I can be able  to afford  127 dollars  you take a trip  to Newark 
[03:27:00]  no  for every hour  I work  you get a certain  amount of minutes  in vacation  a second  and then you can  accumulate  and then use  the hours  if you need  7 hours  though  of vacation  how long  have you worked  there  wow  it'll be 3 years  in March  you think it cruises  the Staten Island  ferry  back and forth  I'll pay it  tomorrow  don't you have to  pay a fee  don't you have to  pay a fee  no  no  they only want  127 
[03:27:30]  I owe about  200  but only 127  I thought if they  shut it off  and have to turn it  back on  you gotta pay  like a fee  no you don't  because I've done  it before  Patty's a soldier  man  you know  she works her  balls off  and they give  her a 7 hour  vacation  7 hours  vacation  more than she deserves  well you only  accumulate  15 minutes  or something  for every so many  hours that you work  and then you  can accumulate  you work a lot of hours  aren't you  you usually get 
[03:28:00]  like even  a week a year  like one week  every year  for vacation  no it doesn't work  that way  you get 7 hours  vacation  you know  some people  have accumulated  30 or 40 hours  by not using  any of the hours  that she did  you know  it's terrible  you know  Jesus Christ  7 hours  Barrett  Barrett from  Pittsburgh  does a 7 hour  vacation go along  with a 24 hour  goal  I still have  17 hours  to be sick  after the fun  of the sun  wow 
[03:28:30]  damn  this fucking  sucks  7 hours  Starbucks vacation  well yeah  but it could  it'll go up  again now  because uh  when I work  every hour  you get a few  minutes  you know  added on  and then  it accumulates  over a period  of time  if you go over  they hobble you  so  what I'm gonna do  is have a  pal talk fest  all day tomorrow  and then a TV  fest all  evening tomorrow  what  what is this 
[03:29:00]  yeah well  that way I get  my internet  turned on  my TV turned on  and I'm gonna  go to town  because I miss  it  after a week  you go crazy  watching just  videos on your  computer  what kind of  programs are you  missing  oh I always  look forward  to intervention  I also like  the dead hour  or whatever  after that  where they  go into houses  and exercise  spirits  I like watching  that show  I don't remember  the name of it  yeah whatever  3 o'clock  is the dead hour  from 3 to 7 
[03:29:30]  when they uh  you watch 3 hours  of that crap  oh sure  I could  and I love  intervention  I like the  lifetime movie  channel  I like the  Turner Classic  movie channel  I like the  Disney channel  does she watch  a bunch of  shit  horrendous  yeah but I  look forward to it  imagine sitting  watching TV  with Patty  oh she's the  worst  those shows  sound awful  I'm packing  for my vacation  I'm taking a  flight to  Nassau  and I'm into  all these  jail programs 
[03:30:00]  women in  prison  lock up  I'm into  all of that  you like that  I love watching  those shows  you watch  first 48  yeah I love  those shows  are you a fan  of the black  men  I just like  the shows  I like watching  the people in  prison  and the women  especially  are you racist  no I'm not  we were talking  about tipping  who tips  the best  when they're  getting their  coffee  do black  people tip  you  do they ever  throw anything  in the tip  cup there  everybody tips  the same 
[03:30:30]  and we have  regulars  in all  nationalities  and we do  better in our  store than  in other  stores  everyone doesn't  tip the same  well no  if they get  80 cents  change  they throw  it in  if they get  the pennies  they throw  it in  no one ever  pockets their  money  no  oh no  I keep tabs  on everything  you know  because  you know  I keep tabs  on everything  because I do  the tips  every week 
[03:31:00]  so I watch  everything  that goes on  because I got  seven hours  of vacation  time  and I use  that  it's like  seven hours  kind of  fucking  actually that's  my grocery  money  that's my  food money  my grocery  money  vacation  that's what I  accumulated  so I used  five of them  for tomorrow's  paycheck  use five  hours of  vacation  yeah  and it's 
[03:31:30]  at your  regular rate  so  you know  two hours  of vacation  you got two  hours left  well no no  because that's  going to go  up  because the  more you  work the  more you  accumulate  them  I want to  take 11  minutes in  June  no the  more you  work the  more you  accumulate  that's  going to  go up  say it  again  20 fucking  times the  more you  work the  more you  accumulate  you could  easily be  our  longest  listener  and you  don't  get this  fucking  show  I don't  know what  you're  hearing when  you listen  to this  show 
[03:32:00]  how do  they  actually  how do  they  actually  determine  jokes  sarcasm  timing  you don't  understand  shit  yeah I'd  love to  know  how do  they determine  what kind  of vacation  you get  yeah  it's just  every hour  you work  it gets  so many  minutes  how many  minutes  I don't  know  I'm not  exactly  sure  I thought  it was  like 15  minutes  or something  per  way  per what  hour  I guess  I don't  rock  then you'd  fucking  get  yeah but  the average  shift is  only five 
[03:32:30]  hours  a week  well she  only works  ten minute  days  no no no  the average  shift is like  five hours  long  maybe I'm  wrong  maybe it's  15 minutes  for every  so many  hours  I'm not  sure  I never  did find  that  I have to  build up  some vacation  time  I need to  go and  buy a  stamp  I have  accumulated  nine minutes  I'm going to  use six  of those  minutes  and I'll  have three  for the  holiday  I'm taking  five minutes  between Christmas 
[03:33:00]  and New Year  step out of the  store take a  breath back  in  one vacation  how do you  look refreshed  and tan  your vacation  stinks  patty  the worst  vacation  I've ever  holy shit  oh my god  a bunch of  slave drivers  over there  that's terrible  Tim from  Glover's  right  seven-hour  vacation  I've sat  on the  shitter  longer  than  her  entire  vacation  allowance  god damn 
[03:33:30]  patty  that is  fucking  terrible  you are  you're  racist  by the  way  I can tell  no I'm  not  it's alright  I'm not  I understand  do you have any  benefits  health benefits  yeah I  I pay  I pay  I pay  almost  a hundred  dollars  a month  for my  share  from Starbucks  the company  doesn't supply  you with  benefits  well yeah  they cover  some of it  but my  I'm 21  something a  week  you know  it could be  like 300  400  dollars a 
[03:34:00]  month  so I  think the  health care  benefits  are  comparatively  good to  other  companies  Godiva  didn't give  me  anything  patty I  wouldn't  blame you  if you  start  shitting  in the  coffee  how they  treat  you  no  I think  I'm treated  very well  where I  am  yeah  that's why  I'll never  leave where  I am  I'm treated  well there  Matt  man from  Marblehead  as patty  hello  Starbucks  I need  to take  three minutes  vacation  to cook  an egg  this is the 
[03:34:30]  dumbest thing  I ever heard  I'm grateful  because I've  never really  had health  benefits from  anyone else  and it's  a hundred  dollars a  month  the most  expensive  plan only  because of  my medical  needs  listen  cunning  from pal  talk  the lines  are too  good  we got  to get  some of  these  on the  air  patty  also gets  up to  25 minutes  in sick  time  that's  what  Steve  needs  Patty's 
[03:35:00]  vacation  would be  just long  enough  for Steve  C  to  recover  from  a  cold  seven  hours  vacation  I did  not hear  that  today  fuck  patty  Jesus  your  world  is  tiring  it's  amazing  that  they  treat  you  like  that  the  other  thing  you  guys  didn't  pick  up  on  that  you  didn't  really  pick  up  that  we  could  explain  a  little  bit  her 
[03:35:30]  exercise  regime  is  ridiculous  and  it's  all  encompassing  I don't  know how  she has  time  to do  anything  else  run  through  all the  exercises  you have  to do  again  well I  gotta lay  on my  side  and do  leg lifts  and then  turn to  the other  side  and do  leg lifts  again  and then  I gotta  lay on  my  back  and go  like  this  like  about  30  times  and stretch  my  back  then I  gotta  go do  wall  exercises  and go  down  like  this  you know  then I  gotta ride  a bike  for 10  minutes  and then I 
[03:36:00]  gotta do  the clay  for 10  minutes  and then I  get the  paraffin  and what do  you do  with that  that's it  the hours  up  and then I  leave  what about  the rubber  bands  well I do  that at  home  as an  exercise  I put a  rubber band  around my  fingers  and I  force  myself  to  do  hand  stretch  with  the rubber  band  and then I  have a  nerve  ball  that I  squeeze  to  to give  more  mobility  in my  hands  so the  arthritis  doesn't 
[03:36:30]  misshapen  them  what do  you mean  so the  arthritis  doesn't  misshapen  you  fingers  can bend  and everything  it can go  like that  so I  just  practice  even if  it hurts  I still  have to  do  it  sure  no  pain  no  gain  you know  I don't  take any  Advil  or anything  because it  only masks  the symptoms  what if you  had to take  maternity leave  from Starbucks  why would they  do that  you have to  have a  procedure  that's fine  that's fine  a lot of people do  a manager 
[03:37:00]  took one  and came back  after the baby  was born  she was fine  she just went to  station period  of a rat  you know  she's running  another store  you know  there's no  event  once you're  ready to  come back  you're back  patty  I never  wanted the  answer  and after  many years  listening  to this  show  you should  have understood  that was  just a set up  to have a  little fun  yes of course  patty  how long  does rat line  is brilliant  I think like  two weeks  less than a month  maybe  ok  that's crazy  Jesus Christ 
[03:37:30]  they could pump  them out  those rats  yeah  wow patty  that's some  fucking life  you're leading  over there  very fast  paced  yeah  there's a lot  of shit  going on  in your life  sit, stand,  squat, work,  vacation  everything in one day  do you take  vacation hours  to do your  exercises  no  I just take  them if I need  the extra money  to pay extra bills  what do you do  now I understand  you're working out  you're trying to  keep from  fucking having  your bones  snap on you 
[03:38:00]  you got a  fucking  spine like a  t-square  what do you do  for fun  what do you do  now  you talk about  work  you talk about  that  what do you do  have a little  fun  well  somebody gave me  a gift card  for Christmas  so I have one  more movie  to go see  so I'm gonna  see Private Life  of Benjamin Button  and then I like  to go to the  library  I get DVDs  I bring them  home  and I watch  them on my 
[03:38:30]  computer  I read  The Private Life  of Benjamin Button  yeah I want to  see that about  the man that's  born old  and then gets  younger  and has  a love interest  in a girl  what do you think  of the new  Sean Penn movie  Yogurt  no the last movie  I saw was  Seven Pounds  and that was good  that made me cry  at the end  seven pounds  because this guy  sacrificed his life  he gave his organs  to seven people  but that's a good  movie to go see 
[03:39:00]  it's a movie  about Steve  seven hours  and I also want  to see The Unborn  me too  I spent my life  trying to get  my face in  where they just  boom  I fell apart  someone did  some quick math  and said  if she stays  with Starbucks  she'll accumulate  about four days  of vacation  over her career  four days  I think I'm  grateful for  what I get  after two years  she's got  seven hours  that's more  than I ever  got from Godiva 
[03:39:30]  yeah  do you work  full time there  because I'm  looking at their  benefits schedule  and it looks like  you should be  getting a little  more than  seven hours  of vacation  well no  they cut our  hours  so I was  scheduled for  15 but a lot  of times  I'll get up  to 20 because  I take people's  ships that they  don't want them  or I try to be  on call  I sleep with  the phone  by my bed  in case I'm  called  I go in  she's a perfect  she's like  a Starbucks cop  she's always  on duty 
[03:40:00]  according to  their employee  benefits package  if you don't  work more than  240 hours per  quarter  you're not  eligible for  their benefits  well that's  why I make  sure I take  the extra shifts  so they don't  catch me in that  because I can't  afford to lose  my benefits  so I am  doing that  making myself  available in the  other stores  around me  five stores  have my phone  number  I cover the  ship on  Saturday night  tell us about  that  I make myself  available 
[03:40:30]  what happened  with that shift  on Saturday  give us the  skinny here  how was it  no I just  work from  11 15 to  3 a.m  but those  are bad  hours  but I took  them  because I  needed the  three and a  half hours  what do you  do all those  hours  you wait on  people  people do come  in at that  time  they are a  busy store  what store  on Union  Square  what  no no  in Times  Square  one of the  24 hour  ones  I didn't know  there was more  than one  yeah there's like  seven or eight  stores in Times  Square  and five of them 
[03:41:00]  have my phone  number  oh you  fucking  whore  they don't call  you  sure  that's why  I was there  the other  night  you know  Patty you realize  that they're  purposely not  they're not  letting you  reach your  240 hour  quota so  that they  could save  money  yeah  they're not  going to do  that to me  well they  are  well I'm going to  make sure of that  trust me I will  because the  owner said that  they wanted to  take care of  his employees  on a national 
[03:41:30]  TV show  about four  years ago  so he ain't  going to go  back on that  promise  oh really  you know the  economy was a  little different  four years ago  especially for  Starbucks  I don't care  I have  health  I need my  money  I don't  care  I don't  care  I will just  make myself  available  even if I  wanted to do  something like  take the day  off or something  I will still  work if it  means that 
[03:42:00]  you know  I have  don't you  understand  what the  CEO or  whoever says  four years  ago  does it  even matter  today  in this  economy  with  Starbucks  because  Starbucks  has been  dropping  the people  not as many  people come  in because  they can't  afford  they then  make changes  so what the  guy does  is not give  you as many  hours  they cut  back on  employees  they do  things  based on  the economy  they don't  give a flying  fuck about  you or your  benefits or  your health  problems or  anything else 
[03:42:30]  holla  well  I don't  know  I'm just  going to  watch  my back  that's the  wall  do you  understand  like  fun house  mirror  if you're  just standing  straight a couple  of weeks  wrapping around  you  if you're a  manager for  Starbucks  anaconda back  they're going to  want to try to  save money and if  they have to pay  you for vacation  if they have to  pay you for time  that you're not  working then that's  something that they're  going to look to  eliminate because  they're trying to  they're trying to cut  cost by  it was on CNN 
[03:43:00]  last week when I  was watching  television I  thought that  they're not  matching the  401ks anymore  but I'm still  going to request  2% out of my  salary even  though I'll miss  the money because  I'm 54 this year  I'm not getting  any younger and  what am I going to  do for when I  can't work  2% of your  paycheck how  much is it  not much  how much  if I make  patty buttons  you want to  cry listen  to this  2% of your  salary for a  401k right 
[03:43:30]  how much is  that  well okay  that's gross  if I gross  maybe 200  then $40  will be taken  out of my  check  no that's not  true  no that's 20%  I mean well  $8 will be  taken out  wait a minute  2%  10% is  $20  $4 will be  taken out of  my check  towards it  that's what  it will be  that's what  I'm getting at  $4 will be  taken out  of my check  for every  $4 comes  out of your  check  that she  desperately 
[03:44:00]  needs  but it won't  be matched  that would be  the only problem  it won't be  matched  they won't  write a check  that small  so why  don't you  just take  the $4  yourself  and put  it in the  bank  because I'll  be tempted  to use it  if I need  transportation  if I need  to buy  food  if I want  to get  a new  pair of  pants  for myself  that I  had to buy  sneakers  for work  so you're  taking  $4  I don't want  to be tempted  so I'd rather  just let it  go away  you're 54  you take 
[03:44:30]  $4 every  week  depending on  how many hours  I work a week  if I work  15 hours  it's less  it's a dollar  and a half  a buck  and a half  so $4 a week  is the max  that you'll put  into your  retirement account  and you're  54 years old  I hope  Bernie Madoff  lost all  it  but people  my age  are working  longer  too  there's people  still working  in their 70s  they're not  working for  like Jimmy  said  1500 years  holy shit 
[03:45:00]  how much  have you got  in the 401  you have the  worst financial  plan ever  it's horrendous  well I didn't  start it yet  she hasn't even  started it yet  oh my gosh  no I'm gonna  I'm trying to  get in contact  with the people  now  the phone  number  oh yeah  you know  just request  even if it's  only 2%  you know  it'll be  something  do you have  anything in 401k  right now  no  it's not open 
[03:45:30]  but she's gonna  start putting  $4 a week  you're starting  a retirement  plan  at 54  by putting  $4 in  for 15 years  well you know  she wants to  enjoy her golden  half hour  she wants to  retire before  the sun  collapses  I know one  thing  I don't know  if we're gonna  have social  security  when we're  old enough  to collect  she'll be  prepared  what  to collect  your $7  and $29  yeah  plug in  one check 
[03:46:00]  and they're  done with  you  you know  and it's  only the last  seven years  of your  work life  that's why  my social  security  has been  going down  every year  when I get  it in March  you know  what do you  usually get  in social  security  in March  well  it said  if you  stopped  working  now  this was  like five  years ago  you'd collect  $900  and then  last year  if you  stop working  now  you will  collect  $640  and I'm  like  what happened  to that  you know  because the  last seven  years 
[03:46:30]  you know  they'll give  you $640  a month  well yeah  if you  stop working  now  but you know  it's hypothetical  is that a month  or a year  a month  it's hypothetical  really  it's going to  change every year  wanting to  stop working  no I can't  afford to  well someone  is uh  you know  speaking the truth  out there  Boomer from Jersey  wait  Patty is the  smart one here  how much has  has she lost  this year  in their  well he wrote  how much has 
[03:47:00]  she lost  in her 401k  I bet  it was a lot  less than  the rest of us  because I had  nothing in it  to begin with  exactly  $4  that is  fantastic  Wyoming has  a great idea  you should  sell your  virginity  oh no  there's a hot  piece of ass  doing that  in Nevada  but still  I think  for the  goof factory  you could  probably get  10 20 G's  for your  virginity  I can't  do that  why not  why not  I don't  know  10 grand  would be  pretty nice  right  give up  your asshole  for 10 grand 
[03:47:30]  how about  no one's  looking cash  my friend  you know  there's  107 year old  woman out there  looking for that  right now  and she probably  has a better  chance than me  well she does  Patty  because she gave  up her snatch  years ago  you  it's incredible  life is passing you by  you haven't learned  shit from us  it's the same story  this could have been  like the first week  we were at  NEW  why don't you have  you're 54 years old  why don't you have 
[03:48:00]  or have ever had  a 40 hour a week  job  with benefits  and  you know  you go and  you work  40 hours  why didn't  we make fun  of you  I'm not qualified  for office work  I can't do it  don't you have a degree  computers and stuff  we've made fun of you  but you have a degree  and you do  come across  being pretty intelligent  what  it's how you  use your intelligence  that's a bit  strange  to say the least  well 
[03:48:30]  in the past  I have applied  to office positions  but I cannot type  right  uh  75 words a minute  right  you know  and I don't  know a lot  I can't even cut  and paste  on the computer  you know  I don't know  how to do basic  things like that  you cut  and you paste  you right click  I love that we have  mathematicians  that listen to the show  we got Jason in Indiana  yes Jason  good evening  hey  um  well in order for 
[03:49:00]  Patty to get  $100,000 saved  in her 401k  at four bucks a week  it would  take her  409 years  to save that  so Patty  you gonna work  at Starbucks  for 409 more years  so you can retire  I don't know  it's just that  you know  well the answer  would be no  no one lives to  that ripe old days  I know one thing  right  Jameson  you don't know  Jameson from Jersey  what's up  she's trying to 
[03:49:30]  save up for that  nice little nest  nest tumor  yes Jameson  or whatever  Jameson  hey boys  hey  yo Patty  Patty's company  treats her worse  than those stupid  cows in the PETA video  yeah no kidding  they treat her worse  than the cows  Patty  let's go to  Vinny in New York  Vinny  what's up boys  hey  hey Patty  Patty can't sell her  Virginia  she had a virgin  no more  she's been getting  fucked by Starbucks  for three years  fucking dope  they got a good  employee there  and they know that  that they can take 
[03:50:00]  advantage a little bit  they are taking  advantage of it Patty  let's go to  Richie in  the Bronx  Richie  yeah what's up boys  Patty  does your pay  stuff look like  does it come with  rollover minutes  like a little cell phone  bill  yeah  wow Patty  you got a cell phone  Patty  yes I do  how do you afford  that  um I  well you know  I  make that one  of my priorities  because I need  the communication  and I don't have 
[03:50:30]  a home phone  and there's no reason  to have one  because I have  the cell phone  I pay  44.03  for my basic plan  and then I add  about 15 to  30 dollars on it  if I need more minutes  do you want a home phone  not really  I have a cell phone  it's more reliable  than a home phone  anyway  what do you call  on your cell phone  oh I  I don't know  I check my bank  balances on it  and you know  and I  call friends  you know 
[03:51:00]  and friends call me  it's good for work  if they need me  to cover a couple hours  something  38 cents  in your account  you know  you check your bank balance  on your phone  why  yeah  and my friends  call me  I call them  well she enters  her like  her account number  and then the voice  goes  fuck you  I'm sorry  you're not worth  our time  yeah really 
[03:51:30]  the call you're making  is more than  the money you got  in the bank  yeah  you've got money  in the bank  you put money  in there  yeah  but I use it  quickly  I had to write  a $50 check  to the New York  Public Library  because they said  I lost the book  and weren't going  to let me  take out the DVDs  so I was forced  to write it  so that's $50  going tomorrow  what book did you steal  I didn't steal  I didn't steal any book  they say I have one out  and I don't  why didn't you fight it  and tell them  go fuck yourself  I don't have the book 
[03:52:00]  well at the moment  I had to do it  because I wanted  the DVDs  and so I just did it  the movies that I watch  you know  you get them  from the library  what movies  yeah  so it's  because it's free  and then sometimes  if I have about five bucks  I go to Blockbuster  I have a card  alright Patty  I'm trying to  I'm trying to  Patty Netflix is $10  you could have had  five months of Netflix  Patty I'm trying to  direct you  in some directions here  like what movies  do you get  from the library  well let me see 
[03:52:30]  the last  I like all the queen ones  about the queen  king of England  I watched Elizabeth  and Bertie  which was good  I watched the queen  about when  Princess Di died  you know  I watched that  morbid  and I also have  the complete season  of you know  on DVD  of I Love Lucy  so I was watching  all of those  I got ones  from Alfred Hitchcock  I Saw It to Kill  a Mockingbird  you know  things like that 
[03:53:00]  I enjoy those movies  alright  and what was the book  they said you had  I don't know  I don't even remember  the name of it  but I told them  I don't have it  you know what I do  I have a tendency  to throw things  in the book drop  and I think  they miss things  in there  so  you should have told them  to go fuck the  50 bucks  what book is $50  right  I had to buy it  they said  yeah what book  is fucking 50 bucks  that you were  I don't know  I have no idea  you wrote a check 
[03:53:30]  for $50  and you have no idea  what book it was  no I don't  but you just wrote  a check  yeah I know  that's a lot of money  for you  I know  it was probably  a stupid thing  to do  but I wouldn't  have been allowed  to take out  the DVDs  but the DVDs  would have cost you  50 bucks  if you bought one  I'm sure  there's a higher  authority there  I could go to  yeah  you know  whoever runs  the libraries  Brooks  easy peasy  Japanese  English 
[03:54:00]  from Escape  from Alcatraz  he's paying  for some  National Geographic  and condensed books  you know  you know what  my biggest suspicion  is  I probably  wrote a check  that my biggest  Patty was here  oh  Patty Brooks  I probably  wrote a check  a while ago  that probably  bounced  and maybe  that's the truth  but they didn't  see it in the computer  they just said  you owe $50  you write a lot 
[03:54:30]  of checks  that bounce  occasionally  they do  her account  comes with  an NBA logo  you know  because I think  the money's  going to be there  and then two items  come at once  they pay the bigger  one before the  smaller one  so all the money  gets taken for that  I've had that  experience before  have you noticed  the world's gotten  itself in a big  damn hurry  you know  but to me  that's not unusual  and it's only  occasionally  occasionally  the phones are lit  yeah  when I have  like $2 
[03:55:00]  left in the bank  I'm happy  when you have  what  when I have  on a Thursday  before I get  paid  when I have  like a couple  dollars in the bank  like $2 or $3  I'm happy  I'm positive  I'm over  yeah  what do you have  a little pass book  and they stamp it  no  ATM card  you know  they don't even  check this  she'll walk you  in her mind  they're like  we'll take your  word for it  but I'm happy  when I have that  because I'm not  overdrawn  you know  and that's more  than  Patty  when I'm  overdrawn  are you working  tomorrow  me tomorrow 
[03:55:30]  no  like I said  tomorrow  tomorrow  you come in  and one of my  one of our guys  remind me  tomorrow's change day  what's that mean  I'm bringing my change  in  I'm going to throw it  at you  there's got to be  a hundred dollars  easy  and whoever comes  by the show  tomorrow  bring your change  for Patty  change day  with Patty  tomorrow  this is killing me  Patty do you understand  something  you're in a very  precarious position  right  you're  not
