<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the announcement of a contest winner, Dave, who created a giant “WOW” sign for a WWF SmackDown taping and won a trip to the Survivor Series.  Dave promised to bring the sign to the studio. The hosts then recounted their experience at an Islanders-Rangers hockey game, with Anthony noting the heavy NYPD presence at the Coliseum.  Callers then phoned in, largely focusing on the hockey game and ribbing Anthony about the Rangers’ victory.

A "Guess Who's Outside" game followed, with clues leading to the eventual reveal of Chris Barron, lead singer of the Spin Doctors, as the mystery guest.  Barron joined the show for an in-studio interview, discussing the Spin Doctors' breakup, his vocal cord paralysis, a new song for the Twin Towers Fund, past drug use (specifically marijuana), and his early life.  The hosts peppered the interview with jokes and anecdotes.

This interview morphed into a chaotic affair with multiple guests.  Barron remained, promoting his new song "We're All New Yorkers Now."  The hosts mentioned Vanilla Ice and porn stars outside.  A call from Big Kev led to a surprise interview with Soupy Sales, who discussed his current projects. Kev promised to connect them with Kathy Garver and Lou Ferrigno.  Mario Cantone then joined the studio, contributing to the increasingly rambling and off-color conversation, with references to hookers and a box of sex toys.

Vanilla Ice finally arrived, discussing his past drug addiction, near-suicide attempt, a tense encounter with Suge Knight, his relationship with Madonna, and the unauthorized use of their photos in a sex book.  The conversation remained rambling, with continued drug references and a mention of Stinky smoking marijuana in the stairwell with guests.

Vanilla Ice continued as a guest, discussing his career as a white rapper, its impact on the hip-hop industry, negative experiences with other artists, and the pressures of the music business.  He also received several listener calls, including a prank call from someone claiming to be Eminem. Big Kev, calling from a comic book convention, surprised the hosts with a call from Kathy Garver. Jay Moore also called in from Las Vegas.

The show took a dramatic turn when Big Kev arranged for several women – Squirt, Ivy, Pinky, Chase, and Fantasy Lady – to come to the studio.  They engaged in explicit sexual activity on-air using sex toys, including a "chin dildo" and a "tool chest," provided by Fantasy Lady.  The hosts provided commentary while Chris Barron’s participation became minimal.  The segment continued with explicit descriptions of the sexual activity.

The show continued with two women demonstrating sex toys, including a tongue vibrator and a device used with Pop Rocks candy.  Fantasy Lady was again prominent. The hosts, along with a staff member, reacted with shock, humor, and awkward commentary.  The segment was punctuated by attempts to transition to other segments, listener calls (including one from a “Little League Mom”), show plugs, and a brief appearance by Chris Barron. The segment ended abruptly with the hosts expressing exhaustion and the crew cleaning up.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All right.  Now, what was the criteria for winning this prize?  Well, we got a trip for two to see WWF Survivor Series in Greensboro, North Carolina on November 18th.  The trip includes round-trip airfare and hotel accommodations, trip courtesy of the WWF and Priceline.com.  The WWF let a lot of our friends go today and yesterday, by the way. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, everyone's cutting back.  They cut back about 20% at the WWF, and we want to say hey to all our friends that lost jobs yesterday and today.  WWF Survivor Series only on pay-per-view.  Call your pay-per-view provider to order now.  Well, this contest was basically very easy, actually.  Yeah.  Every taping of Raw.  Stop throwing the D-tacks.  The Ick-tacks.  Pretty much every live taping of WWF, Raw, and SmackDown, we have ONA-related signs in the audience. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  It's been happening for a couple of years now.  It's quite flattering to see Opie and Anthony on TV, ONA 316, Norton 316, Opie Watt.  A lot of fans.  I like that.  Lots and lots of wow signs.  So we had a quick contest because WWF, they taped on Long Island Monday for Raw, and they taped Saturday, SmackDown, the other night in Jersey.  Yeah.  So we were looking for the best show-related sign that made TV. 
[00:01:30]  And that's who will take the trip.  Right.  All right.  Now, Monday, we had, I think it was three or four guys in the front row, or the first three rows, that had an Opie and Anthony sign, an Opie Watt, Norton 316.  That stinks.  So many show-related signs.  Wow signs.  A stinky sign.  And we thought that no one was going to beat that.  Right.  Well, SmackDown was on last night.  And if you didn't watch, there was a guy, I think he was in like the third row, he had a wow sign that took up pretty much, what would you say, like half the ring? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, it was half the size of the ring it looked.  It was the biggest sign that said anything.  It was the biggest sign I've ever seen at a WWF event.  Right.  Especially that up close.  Right.  So a lot of people have been emailing and calling and stuff, and hands down, the guy that had the wow sign on SmackDown last night will be going to Survivor Series.  Mm-hmm.  Our listeners have decided that he had the better sign. 
[00:02:30]  Right.  Because the wow was just huge.  It had to be, what, three or four feet high?  Yeah, it was giant.  And it had to be, what would you say, like eight feet long?  Yeah, it took up quite a few seats.  I think it's going to be up on foundrymusic.com later on today, so you can check it out for yourself if you missed the taping.  Put it this way, it was so big that the guy should have gotten the crap beat out of him from the people behind him.  Because I would have been pissed.  It covered up the entire, you couldn't see, if you were behind him, you weren't seeing anything but that sign.  And the guy kept lifting it up with your friends. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  I think he's coming down here with the sign today, so.  He's coming down?  He's on his way.  Well, he's the winner of the Trip to Survivor Series in Greensboro, North Carolina.  Solved out of the media.  That's November 18th.  Trip courtesy of WWF and Priceline.com.  WWF Survivor Series only on pay-per-view.  Call your pay-per-view provider to order now.  All right?  So that contest is out of the way.  Is this the guy right here? 
[00:03:30]  Dave, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  You tell me.  I can't hear you, man.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, what's going on?  I'm heading over over now.  All right, well, congratulations.  Hands down, you won the contest.  You're going to Survivor Series.  Cool.  I'll bring in the sign with me.  All right, cool.  I'll be there maybe like an hour.  All right, yeah, you picked a great day to win a contest because we're going to have a wild show with a bunch of ladies today.  All right.  All right.  I'll see you there, man.  All right, bye.  Later.  You got to be won.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Dave, you still there? 
[00:04:00]  Dave.  Dave.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh.  I love that.  What's the problem?  Nah.  Hey, Dave, call back.  Stinky needs to talk to you.  He'll find it.  There you go.  He'll find it.  John, what's going on?  Oh, B.  How about them Islanders, huh?  Oh.  Well, yeah, the Rangers beat the Islanders last night.  Yeah.  I'm a diehard Ranger fan, and I'll be the first one to admit the Rangers sucked this year,  but we spanked your boys last night. 
[00:04:30]  Well, it's still early in the year.  We'll get you back.  What can I say?  You guys spanked us last night.  If we lose the rest of the year, it'll be worth it because we beat you guys.  Yeah, okay.  That's all that matters.  Yeah, let's hear you in, like, April.  I know, Biggie.  Listen, guys.  A magnet?  Yeah, I got to try and get these things out somehow.  It's a magnet, you dope.  Not a C-ring.  Don't use that language.  Why do you think we say C-ring?  Oh, because I'm not on the radio.  I'm allowed to say that's where I shut up.  You are on the radio. 
[00:05:00]  That's the problem.  All right, but I don't get in trouble.  Have a good one, boy.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Yeah, right after the show yesterday, I raced out to the Coliseum to see the Islander Ranger  game.  Missed the whole first period because traffic blows in this town.  Now, I hear it was an action-packed first period.  Yeah, I missed everything.  I'm listening to the game on the fan.  Yeah.  There you go.  I'll give him a little plug.  Ski.  Out of, man.  Had to blow off Ron and Fez last night.  I felt guilty, but I had to listen to the Islander game. 
[00:05:30]  Did you forget to go?  Yeah, I'll get to that in a second.  And I missed fighting, scoring.  All the action was in the first period.  The place was going nuts, and I'm stuck in traffic trying to get to Long Island.  I get to the Coliseum.  It was beyond packed.  Yeah.  There wasn't a seat to be had.  Islander Ranger games, always a big draw.  Mostly Ranger fans of the Coliseum.  Of course.  It pisses me off.  It was like the Subway Series.  You went to Shea, and it was a lot of Yankee fans. 
[00:06:00]  It pissed me off, but whatever.  So, the weird thing about last night's game, though, police guys all over the place with  machine guns.  Police?  Police.  Special Force.  What are they called?  Someone will help me out.  Special Ops.  What?  Were they Army?  Probably National Guard, Army Reserve.  No.  They were part of the NYPD, man.  Why would NYPD be in Nassau?  Or is it Nassau County?  Nassau County.  Really?  Someone will help me out.  It was definitely a division of the police.  And they had automatic weapons? 
[00:06:30]  Heavily armed.  They looked like machine guns.  I like that.  And they were everywhere.  And you know what?  I felt really safe last night.  Yeah.  And we have all this firepower.  It's time to protect our own.  We're one of the last few.  I don't mind seeing a guy with a machine gun as I'm walking into a sporting event.  Yeah.  We're one of the few countries left that didn't have that going on in the world.  You know what I mean?  Like you'd see all these videos from other countries.  People with machine guns hanging out at airports and sporting events and whatnot.  We would always go about our business with nothing like that.  Now, there they are with machine guns at the Nassau Coliseum. 
[00:07:00]  It was amazing.  And not just a couple guys.  They were everywhere.  Yeah.  I mean everywhere.  Well, good.  I don't know what that's going to do, to tell you the truth, to thwart any terrorism.  Since they're suicide guys, by the time they do it, it's too late.  And they don't care if they die.  So, ah, but it feels good.  Yeah, we got to start somewhere, though.  Yeah.  There you go.  Let's go to Kevin.  Kevin, what's up?  You're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's happening, guys? 
[00:07:30]  Hey.  Hey, man.  You ever see the little witch on Bugs Bunny?  Tell me more about where she goes.  Tell me more about my eyes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Opie, tell me more how the sports curse is over.  It's over.  It's over.  He's been to quite a few Islander games.  I'm going to be rooting for the Islanders every game this season.  Do the math.  They're going to lose a couple.  They're going to lose eventually.  Yeah, but you made a special point of bringing up the Ranger game yesterday.  Well, of course.  If you're a hockey fan, you've got to, you know, bring that up. 
[00:08:00]  We got spanked by the Rangers of all teams.  Big rivalry between the two teams.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Bring on your abuse.  There's nothing I can say.  We got spanked.  Doug, what's going on?  Rangers, how you doing?  What a dick.  What happened to Doug?  Doug?  Doug?  Doug?  Mike, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  How about them Rangers, huh?  I thought you wanted to talk about wrestling. 
[00:08:30]  Well, yeah, I just wanted to vote for that sign, but you already picked him out.  Well, hands down, the email went crazy.  We read, you know, all the email.  Only, like, two people voted for the guys from, you know, Raw.  But the guys from Raw are going to get a DVD player from Samsung.  See?  They'll get a nice DVD player.  And the guy from SmackDown last night with that huge wow sign is going to Survivor Series  in North Carolina.  That's cool.  Did you miss it?  Fanta Wrestling, Fanta ONA.  You win.  Oh, you missed the first period yesterday, right?  After one of the fights, Theo Flurry is skating out on the ice and he's flapping his wings. 
[00:09:00]  I saw it.  And go Rangers.  See you, fellas.  We'll get him next game.  But there was some pleasure in the game last night, Anthony.  Yeah?  I'm sitting with Joey Paisano.  Yeah?  And Ted from the Islanders comes by in between the second and third period, right?  Mm-hmm.  He's a friend of mine over there at the NASA Coliseum, the marketing guy.  Name dropper.  Name dropper.  Name dropper.  We don't drop names usually.  Gives me free parking.  I've got to say something.  Oh!  Gives me the sweet spot.  So I'm sitting there and he comes by to say hi. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, he goes, well, Rick finally made it to the Coliseum.  And I went, oh.  Oh.  And I cursed.  I forgot.  I was supposed to bring Rick to the Coliseum after the show yesterday.  You left here yesterday after the show and you left that cartoon smoke behind you.  Instead of legs, he had wheels.  I think I actually heard, pew, when you left. 
[00:10:00]  Well, they dropped the puck at like 710, I think.  I was thinking, how the hell is he going to get there?  And I know I'm going to miss some of the game.  And, you know, we were on a roll yesterday, so we didn't want to go to a brewer bit for  the last 20 minutes of the show.  So I'm watching the clock.  I'm like, oh, I've got to get out of here.  And I forgot, Rick, earlier in the day, said, can I, you know, catch a ride with you to the  Coliseum?  I got a last-minute ticket to the game.  Yeah.  He's a Ranger fan, though, so I'm loving this today.  You ditched him.  Flat lever.  So, you know, our office is way, way down the other side of the floor. 
[00:10:30]  So during the first break last night, I got all my stuff.  I didn't even want to go down to the office, right outside the studio door.  So when we said goodbye yesterday, you did the live read by yourself, right?  Cuts off a good 80 feet of walking.  Well, a couple minutes here, a couple minutes there, you know.  So we go into commercials, and I just bolted.  I took a quick leak, and I was out the door.  And, Rick, you try to chase me down?  Yeah, well, I came back into the studio, and I saw your stuff there, right, just as you 
[00:11:00]  went into the bathroom.  So I'm like, all right, it'll be two minutes.  Let me gather up my stuff.  Because I got my stuff, too.  I'm like, all right, I'll just drop this off at the office.  We'll head down.  Next thing I know, gone.  Not a sign of him anywhere.  So I run downstairs, take the elevator down.  I get down there.  Gone.  I look all over.  Gone.  He's just gone.  I lucked out.  There was no line at the parking garage.  I was gone.  But I then got stuck in the stupid Manhattan traffic.  Yeah.  I had a good start, but then it didn't mean nothing, because I still missed the whole first 
[00:11:30]  period.  So I'm like, I'm trying to call him on the cell phone.  I'm like, dude, you forgot me.  My phone wasn't on either.  And his phone wasn't on.  What a shocker.  I forgot to put my phone on.  You have a guy on the cell phone.  It never turns it on.  Because I hate people calling me.  I think that was just the word up to the U.  I don't think you got a C in there.  I don't think you got a K in there.  I got part of the C in there. 
[00:12:00]  It sounded like it was just the F U.  It was.  There was a part C in there.  Wasn't there just a tiny bit?  Ben, I shoved my phone off because I don't need 20 phone calls from you saying the same  exact thing.  I love it, though, and slip out because it's so real, man.  You're just like, hey, man.  It's like Earl does the same thing.  He buys a cell phone, and he'll be at an event, and we'll be trying to call him, and he'll  go, oh, you've reached Earl.  Please leave a message.  It's like, Earl, why do you have a cell phone?  You do it all the time.  You always do it. 
[00:12:30]  He probably could have caught you because the traffic wasn't that bad a block away.  Oh, well.  This is the ball's off.  What's the point of having a phone?  I forgot.  I was in a hurry.  The phone's right next to me here.  You want me to turn it on?  It's usually off during the show.  Hello.  You've reached Earl Douglas' phone.  I'm not, uh, my phone's not on, I guess, but if this is Ben, you can call me.  I might be at the office.  If it's, um, Jeremy, um, catch me later. 
[00:13:00]  And, uh, if it's anyone else, oh, one more thing.  Oh, my God.  You ever hear his messages?  Oh, his message.  Oh, it's five minutes long, Earl.  I'm doing the public file right now.  Earl has written on the screen, please go F yourself.  Dude, he's the worst.  Every time we do a sticker stop, we call him because we'd be in the middle of something.  Yeah.  Call you right back when we get you on there.  Click.  Hi, you've reached Earl.  I'm unavailable right now.  It goes on and on, and he never has it on. 
[00:13:30]  He's the worst.  He's worse than you.  I don't understand people that have the cell phones and don't turn them on or don't answer  them or something.  I just didn't have it on.  Mine's on all the time, and I usually answer it, uh, or if I don't answer it, it's because  I didn't get it in time, and then I call right back.  So, so I ditched, uh, Rick.  Ready for this?  Rick, when did you finally make it to the Coliseum?  Uh, halfway through the second period.  It's like a, at that point, why bother?  Because it was just, you know what, it didn't matter because I got to see the last two goals 
[00:14:00]  the Rangers scored and laughed when all the Islander fans start filing out of that place  like, like there was a bomb scare.  How come you left right after Opie, but he got there?  He had to catch the train.  I had to catch the train.  Oh, okay.  That's even worse.  Now it makes it even worse.  Yeah, so he has to catch the subway down to Penn Station.  I'm looking down the street.  I don't see him.  Then I got to catch a train.  I barely make that.  And then what do you do once you get into Union Day?  Oh, you went home?  I went home.  I had to get my car, drop off my stuff.  Once you're home, you know what you do?  You sit in front of the TV, you turn on the game, and watch it all. 
[00:14:30]  You're right.  So when Ted told me last night, I'm like, oh, man.  And I go, where is he?  He points him out.  So now Rick's calling me on the cell phone.  Now it's on.  So now he's calling me.  Oh, you're those guys?  I'm cell phone guy.  And I hate being cell phone guy at sporting events.  But Rick is like, Rick is just gesturing to his phone like, turn your phone on.  So I turn it on.  It starts ringing.  He's cursing me out from the upper decks.  You know, the one thing with you is, why is your cell phone on always when you're at these events? 
[00:15:00]  Because you'll call him and you get right through.  Oh, I'm at the Islander game, dude.  Oh, there's all this noise.  That's the only time you can reach you is if you're at something.  But if it's something important, it's, I'm going to call you on this one.  You called me at the last Islander game, and that was the day we were all leaving for Boston to broadcast from Boston.  Okay, you're right.  So I had it on because I knew there would be last minute crap going on.  I hate, and knows, because it's kind of the Nick games with me and stuff.  I hate cell phone guy.  Yeah, and he didn't have it on last night. 
[00:15:30]  I had a motion to him.  Yeah, he had a motion like, pick up your phone.  And at that point, I'm like, I've got to take my abuse.  I left the kid in the city.  How many times have you seen the jackass turned around in his seat, standing up, facing the crowd,  waving the arm, and go, you see me?  Yeah.  You see me?  You see those guys on TV at the baseball games.  They're like waving, like, you see me?  I'm talking to you right now.  Sit down.  It's one thing to call while, you know, what are you doing?  That is horrible on the mic.  You're going to drive me nuts with that. 
[00:16:00]  It's one thing.  You want me to throw something at you?  I know how to get to it.  Come on.  Calm down.  That's not that thing.  All right, I'll take the thing off.  All right.  No, it's one thing if, like, you're calling your friends at home when you're on TV, like,  dude, do you see me?  Look, I'm right behind, you know, home plate.  Yeah, yeah.  But, like, at the Garden, at the Knick games, where, yeah, they stand up, the guys that have  the court seats, and they look way up into the rafters.  Can you see me?  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:16:30]  Hey.  Hey.  By the way, someone called and said that the guys with the automatic weapons and the machine  guns last night at the Coliseum was part of the Nassau County SWAT team.  SWAT?  Yeah.  They did have the SWAT gear on, now that I think about it.  It wasn't, uh, the grease man, one of, uh, the SWAT team, uh, waddle-doodle, slinging  lead, uh, preventing terrorism.  It's me, the grease man.  Uh, there I was deployed at the Nassau Coliseum, uh, never knowing if a terrorist element's 
[00:17:00]  gonna burst in.  Well, I loaded up my weapon, uh, and I hunkered down, uh, behind a bush outside, waiting for  some towel-headed, uh, terrorist, uh, me and the rest of the boys in the SWAT team, uh,  ever vigilant, uh, and then we spotted somebody, someone of Arab descent, uh, coming towards 
[00:17:30]  the building, uh, waddle-doodle.  Well, we loaded up the guns, uh, and approached the man, uh, and, uh, since it's a grease  man story, that's where it ends, uh, waddle-doodle, we'll be back with more of the grease man  show after these words, uh, waddle-doodle, uh, oh, ponderous, no wonder they blow them up  in trucks, uh, I apologize, uh, his stories would just end. 
[00:18:00]  Uh, he roped you in and then they'd just end.  All right.  Well, we do have lots going on.  We have the box of sex toys in the, in the corner.  Can't wait.  We have girls coming in to, to use them.  Waddle-doodle.  We have, uh, is, is Vanilla Ice coming by today?  Yeah.  Am I hearing right?  Vanilla Ice is coming by?  Is he gonna be cool, though?  Yeah, they said he's gonna be cool.  He'll talk about anything?  He'll talk about banging Madonna. 
[00:18:30]  Now, I saw him at one of the...  Are we the first radio show to at least get this guest?  No.  No?  I don't know.  I think so, yeah.  Not even this one?  No, I think so.  We've had a bad week with that.  We're getting the retreads.  Earl.  Calm down, Earl.  What's wrong, Earl?  You came in all, uh...  Oh, his face looked all pissed off, but then we realized that was just the way he looked.  Well, he had a wisdom tooth pulled.  You did?  You can't spare any, can you?  Jesus.  Jesus.  First person I've, I've ever met that had wisdom teeth pulled and his face didn't swell up. 
[00:19:00]  Couldn't you have called the dentist and told him, can you...  But then again, how can you tell with that Shrek jaw of yours?  Why, oh, why couldn't the dentist have pulled your lazy tooth?  You're even smiling out over that one.  You know, that was a good one.  Yeah, kid.  All right.  So, Vanilla Ice. 
[00:19:30]  Vanilla Ice.  Yeah, I saw him on TV on one of those roasts.  He was in the back during one of those celebrity roasts on Comedy Central.  And some of the people that got up there were goofing on him.  And he seemed to smile.  It seems like he has a sense of humor.  Well, they've...  Not that we're just going to sit here and lambazze him, but I kind of want some info on when he was Vanilla Ice.  Well, they've been working us hard with this Vanilla Ice.  And, man, if he comes in here and he's a bore, it's going to suck.  But they said he's going to play, right?  Yeah.  He is?  Yeah.  So, you won't have to worry about getting your ass kicked in like you were talking about. 
[00:20:00]  Will he put the chin dildo on?  Ice, ice.  Sell a record you never know.  All right.  So, he's coming by.  And then, I wanted to do a little tease with this one.  Yeah.  We got this email.  Oh, yeah.  From someone that used to be very famous.  Well, I think he's still famous.  Well, you still know who he is.  Let's just put it on.  Okay.  That's what I mean.  Let's just put it this way. 
[00:20:30]  In the music biz?  Yeah.  There was a year or two where he was the biggest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll give you that.  Would you say that, Earl?  Huge crossover.  Right?  Yeah.  He had the most played record on rock radio.  Right.  Oh, yeah?  And, well, he hasn't been as lucky lately.  Right?  No.  So, he sends us instant feedback yesterday begging to come on our show.  Yeah.  Well, that's cool.  So, what happened?  And so, Rick...  So, Ben calls.  Oh, Ben calls him. 
[00:21:00]  And he just showed up.  And he just showed up and he's outside.  Oh, he is?  What's he in New York?  He's in New York, I guess.  Yeah.  Sure.  New York guy.  He lives in New York?  New York guy.  Well, that's pretty cool.  Maybe the first person to guess who it is will give a prize.  Do we have anything laying around?  Yeah.  We have tons of stuff.  All right.  Haven't we...  Guess who is outside our studio with those few facts we just gave you.  All right.  Okay?  Okay.  And the first person that guesses right will win something.  We got George Carlin tickets, Brewer tickets. 
[00:21:30]  We got a Samsung DVD player.  No, Ted, it is not Slim Whitman.  It'll be your choice.  Oh, I think he used to say, he sold more records than the Beatles and Elvis combined.  Remember that commercial?  Rosemary.  Him and Boxcar Willie.  It's not MC Hammer.  No, it's not George Harrison.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, come on.  Poor George.  He's busy dying in Staten Island right now.  What's the over-under on George, Merle?  Two weeks. 
[00:22:00]  I give him two weeks.  Two...  What?  About a month.  A month?  A month.  No way.  Two weeks.  God, that guy's had it rough in the later part of his life.  I guess, you know, you pay the price for early fame.  He's not even that old.  I thought he was smoking all the time.  What is he, Earl?  58?  We would smoke in Liverpool.  That's all we did.  We'd smoke.  Then we'd get on the helicopter.  English accent.  All right, we have to take a break, so... 
[00:22:30]  Let's play guess who is outside our studio.  Okay.  Look at six.  Huh?  No, no.  It's a very good answer, Ernie-O, but it is not Neil Diamond.  Well, Billy Mac's got a guess on line six.  Does he?  Nice call back, too.  Billy Mac.  I don't know.  Is it Oogie Pringle?  Oh, my God.  No, it's not Oogie Pringle.  Oogie Pringle.  Thank you, guys.  Everyone knows Oogie killed himself in 1987.  After having sex with...  Peggy. 
[00:23:00]  Peggy from the show yesterday.  All right.  Not John.  Wait.  We'll be back.  One of the guys on the phones might have it.  Oh.  Looks like he does have it.  Really?  We'll take your guesses next, though.  Opie and Anthony, it's the kind of show where you can feel out your sister.  Feel out your sister.  Feel out your sister.  I can bring it in.  I can bring it in.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What? 
[00:23:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Just started playing the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City tonight.  Bunch of us going to the show.  I am so there.  I can bring it in.  What?  What?  Are you ready?  This is the dark.  This is the dark.  Are you ready?  All right.  It's time to play Guess Who's Outside Our Studio, Anthony.  All right.  This came about very strangely.  Yeah.  Yesterday, he instant feedbacked the show.  Right. 
[00:24:00]  He had two incredible years in the music business with his band.  Probably the biggest rock band for about a year, year and a half to two years.  Okay.  And then fell out of sight.  Yeah, a lot of people wonder what the hell happened.  Gone, just like that.  Poof.  Was everywhere.  Rock stations, the pussy stations, every station that played music played this band's music. 
[00:24:30]  One of the few acts that crossed over to every single format.  Every format.  It was amazing.  Huge.  And then, you know, they put out another album.  And nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Hmm.  People want to guess, Anthony.  We got a good prize for the winner, okay?  Yeah.  Kevin.  What's happening, guys?  Who do you think's outside our studio right now?  Billy Squire.  Billy Squire?  Stroke me, stroke me.  No, no.  Sorry, man.  We can only be so lucky. 
[00:25:00]  Take it easy.  All right.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve.  Yeah, well, I was going to say Gerardo.  Rico Slavik guy?  Rico Slavik.  But I'm going to change it.  Is it Hootie?  No.  Hootie?  That's Darius, whatever the dude's name is.  Oh, the lead singer of Hootie and the Blowfish?  Yeah.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Everyone guessing.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What do you think?  You said absolutely nothing. 
[00:25:30]  So it's got to be Dice.  That's very funny.  Take off.  It's not Dice.  Not Dice.  Scott from Manhattan.  Is it Young MC?  Mike from Long Island.  Tone Loke?  I like this one.  Is it Snow, Informer?  Licky Boom Boom Down?  Carol from Jersey writes, is it Spuds Buckley or Mad Max?  Spuds Buckley.  Justin from Philly writes, I'm guessing you have Big Chocolate outside the studio. 
[00:26:00]  Johnny Paycheck.  E-Man writes, it must be the lead singer from As Is.  You're very funny.  That would be AZ IZ.  Buster Poindexter.  No.  Doug from Brookline.  No sleep till Brookline.  No, it's not Yanni.  Cochise writes, Mike Reno and his headband.  No.  No, it's not Rick Astley.  Rick Astley.  Astley, right.  Remember him?  Sure.  Michael Bolton?  No.  Mike from Queens.  Is it the guy who wrote, I want to be a hunkamaniac? 
[00:26:30]  It's not Tommy Lee.  Let's go to Keith.  Keith.  Hey.  Who do you think is outside our studio?  Stashing box.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  David Coverdale.  Sorry about that.  It's not Gary Glitter.  Let's go to Larry.  Larry.  Hey, what's up, guys?  You have a guess?  Is it the bathroom faggot from Wham?  Jesus.  Shut up.  No, it's neither guy from Wham. 
[00:27:00]  Nice guess, though.  Best guess so far is Sebastian Bach, by the way.  It's not Michael Jackson.  It's not right, said Fred, and it's not Dee Snider.  Dave writes, hmm, what's big for a year or two, nothing going on and begging to be on O&A.  Can it be Andrew Dice Clay?  No.  Someone is guessing Billy Ray Cyrus, Anthony.  Rick Springfield.  No.  Is it Brett Michael, C.C. DeVille, Ricky Rocket?  No, it's not Axl Rose.  Tom, what's up? 
[00:27:30]  Hey, how are you doing?  Is it Lenny and the Squigtones?  No.  Lenny and the Squigtones.  Squigtones.  Come on.  From 1980.  How about that big fat load of John Popper?  No, it's not John Popper.  And you made two guesses, so we hang up.  All right.  Well, here's his instant feedback.  Right.  Hi, I'm Blank, the lead singer of The Blanks.  The Blanks?  Never heard of them.  I wrote a song that's an uplifting rock anthem, which I'm selling for $5 and donating 100% to 
[00:28:00]  the Twin Towers Fund for the FDNY and all the uniformed emergency personnel who gave their  lives on September 11th.  I thought it would be cool to come by the show and give Opie and Anthony a box of CDs to give  out on the air.  This is where he's not sure if we're going to believe him, so he writes, I really am  the guy from The Blanks.  I wrote blank and blank, which were played on your station a lot, I think.  My home phone number is...  There you go.  Call me, and I'll sing them to you, and you'll know I'm for real. 
[00:28:30]  You don't have to go that far.  That's classic.  Anyone guess yet?  Let's see, a couple more guesses here.  Mike?  Who do you think's outside our studio?  David Lee Roth or Moose Moran?  No, it's not Moose Moran.  Damn.  J.J. French.  I thought someone had it.  Jim, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, could it possibly be Rick Springfield?  No.  And have that chick call in and just scream hello constantly? 
[00:29:00]  Hello, hello.  No, no.  Actually, my real guess is it's the singer of Naked Cowboy.  Okay.  Have a good weekend, guys.  But that guy's sitting across from me right now.  All right.  Let's see if Justin has it.  Justin.  Yeah, dude, I got it.  You got it?  Yeah, I think so.  Is it Chris from Spin Doctors?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Chris Barron from the Spin Doctors.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:29:30]  You're right.  Nice.  Well, let's bring him in.  Justin, we're going to give you something, all right?  Sweet.  Hey, hey, give me anything but his CD.  Oh, shut up.  Hey, where are you calling from?  Boston.  Boston?  Yeah.  There he is.  All right.  Wow, it is him.  Look, I remember you.  Hold on, Justin.  We'll give you a prize.  What's up, Chris?  Nice to meet you, man.  You're growing your hair back.  Didn't you cut off your hair and your beard and stuff to get a new look going on?  Cut it off, grew it back, cut it off again.  Right.  I don't know what I'm doing now. 
[00:30:00]  Hair-wise, anyway.  Hair-wise.  Yeah, we got you in some feedback yesterday.  Here it is.  Yeah.  I don't know how you got it yesterday because I wrote it today.  No, it was today.  Oh, it was today?  It was today.  Before the show today?  Yeah.  Right on.  So what happened?  What, to the Spin Doctors?  Yeah.  We imploded.  We hated each other.  Did you?  Yeah.  One of those bands?  Yeah.  But you were a New York band that was around forever.  We loved each other, but we hated each other.  It was one of those kinds of things where I would dive into a hurricane ocean after any 
[00:30:30]  of those dudes, but I wouldn't eat dinner with them.  Right.  That kind of thing.  But you guys played around New York forever before you made it, right?  Oh, yeah.  We called it the Manhattan Tour.  We played like six nights a week forever, though.  For many years.  About a year.  Oh, that was it?  Yeah, just about a year.  I like the crap little clubs and stuff, just trying to eek out an existence.  You know what?  That was the happiest time of my life.  See?  You look back now and it all...  I was happy then, though.  We used to sit.  Yeah, because the singer never moves the equipment out of it.  We knew it. 
[00:31:00]  You know what?  You got that wrong.  You got that wrong.  I moved everything.  I moved everything.  Mark White, our bass player, lived in Queens.  Yeah.  So he kept his stuff in Manhattan.  So he had...  Oh, I can't take it all the way from Queens.  And so our guitar player was just like...  What shall I say?  Difficult.  To speak the truth.  Guitar plays are always difficult.  Guitar...  What is a guitar player?  Prima Donna, sons of bitches.  What is he?  Why was he difficult?  Keep going.  Keep going.  Why was he difficult?  Why was he difficult?  He's just one of these guys who... 
[00:31:30]  Like, everybody's like afraid of.  You know?  You just never know what...  One of those...  You know what it is?  In most bands, there's one guy that's like the power guy  that just wants to make a lot of the decisions for the band.  Was he like that?  Yeah.  Is that the kind of deal?  Yeah, yeah.  Was recording very difficult with him?  And I did, too.  You know?  I had like...  I was more like in the passive-aggressive tip.  Right.  Did you have a lot of trouble recording because he had his ideas and...  Yeah.  There was some of that going on.  There was some of that going on.  Anyone that's been in a band for any length of time... 
[00:32:00]  Because before I started doing radio, I was in a lot of bands around Long Island  and New York.  I was a singer.  Oh, yeah.  And my brother was a bass player.  Singers are the worst.  Singers usually are bastards because they got the excuse like,  leave me alone, man.  I'm just going to hang out.  I don't want to...  They're all...  Emotional.  Emotional.  Don't talk to me.  Leave me alone.  And then after the show, everything's cold.  You got to...  At least guitar players are like...  It's all above board.  Right.  You know, like guitar players are like... 
[00:32:30]  They're like nasty, you know, mercurial.  Right.  I don't know what that means, but it sounds right.  And the drummers are all just happy to be there.  Yeah.  They're all like, happy guys.  Yeah.  I'm just happy to be playing.  At bass players, you don't really know what you're going to get with a bass player.  Yeah.  There's somewhere between guitar players and drummers.  Yeah.  Some of them are like drummers.  You know what?  You watch Spinal Tap, it gives you a great example of what the guys in the bands are like.  Have you ever heard that rock and roll myth that Eddie Van Halen saw that movie  and didn't know it was a joke?  He goes, yeah, why is everyone laughing?  This isn't funny.  Is that true? 
[00:33:00]  I don't know.  It makes great urban legends.  Knowing Eddie Van Halen, it's got to be true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So then you guys just self-destructed.  Now, you had to, at one point, look around and go, dude, got to hold it together.  We're on top of the world, man.  You guys were beyond huge.  Beyond huge.  You couldn't turn on the radio without hearing you.  Yeah, right?  For about 10 minutes.  And Little Miss can't be wrong.  For about 10 minutes.  Yeah.  They play that stuff a lot.  Yeah.  I think there was a touch of overexposure.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, every station was, like Ben said, every station in New York was playing. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  If I was like, everybody who got totally sick of the Spindockers and hated them by the  end, call in right now.  That screen would explode.  You know?  The thing would break, you know?  I mean, there was definitely a lot of, like, overexposure.  And then the second album came out, it didn't do as well.  Well, yeah.  I mean, it's funny, because it sold, like, two million records.  Right?  Yeah.  But the first one sold, like, 84 kabillion records.  Once you set that mark with the first one, even if the second one does well, if it doesn't 
[00:34:00]  do as well, then you're a failure.  How funny is it?  You sell two million records and it's a failure.  Yeah.  How ridiculous is that?  Yeah, it's weird.  You know, the business, the post, like, Michael Jackson thriller record business, just really,  you know, it's weird.  Yeah.  I'm grateful.  I'm just glad.  I'm still a musician.  You know, play music for a living and, like, just happy to play music.  And you don't talk to the guys at all?  I talked to Aaron, the drummer.  And you know what?  We're, like, all cordial and civil.  Now, you know, we actually did, like, a reunion at the Wetlands on the 9th, September. 
[00:34:30]  You know?  And it was great.  Cool.  We all had an absolute ball.  Really?  We all had an absolute ball.  Everybody?  Yeah?  Yeah, the place was mobbed.  And the band, you know, I mean, I really enjoyed it.  I don't know, you know, how great it sounded from off the stage.  But, you know, it sounded good to me.  What about the...  After enough time goes by, you can kind of look back a little nostalgic and forget about  the bull crap you had to put up with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know what?  You know something?  That feeling goes away real quick. 
[00:35:00]  We did one rehearsal.  We did one rehearsal and then we did the gig.  So it was like, there's no time to...  Right.  You get pissed off at the old stuff you had to deal with.  Yeah, exactly.  Now, what about the rumor about your voice?  Lost my voice for a year.  For a year?  I lost my voice for a year.  Yeah.  I had a paralyzed vocal cord.  How do you get that?  It's...  Jesus.  They don't really know.  It's like a weird neurological kind of...  You know, I don't know what it was.  It might have been, like, psychological, too.  Really?  It was like, just...  Was it just you singing or talking or... 
[00:35:30]  Oh, talking.  Talking.  What did it sound like when you...  I thought it sounded like this.  Holy shit.  People were like...  People were like, why are you whispering?  You know?  I'd be like, don't ask that.  You know, it's almost like Satan was, like, saying, okay, time to pay up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had that pinnacle of success and then all of a sudden, hey, and now, oh, you didn't  read the fine print.  Your voice goes away.  No, you got it.  We're taking your voice for a while.  You got it.  You must have thought, like, oh, my God, what happened?  Oh, you got it.  I was looking around for the devil, like, can I sign something? 
[00:36:00]  You know?  That's unbelievable.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  And then it just came back?  Like, slowly over about six months.  I spent six months whispering, you know?  And what happens, you know...  Did that happen to meatloaf, too, or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Same thing the meatloaf had.  Yeah, same thing.  Same exact thing the meatloaf had, you know?  It was a nightmare.  But, yeah, over about...  I sounded like the godfather for a while, and then I sounded, like, a little better and a  little better and a little better.  And then now my voice is, you know, better than ever.  And it's the kind of thing, it's like, I'm back, you know, the chances of it happening 
[00:36:30]  to any of us are, like, a zillion to one, and I'm back in the pool again, you know?  Right, right.  Yeah, Kenohara.  Whatever that means.  Kobe wants to say hi.  Kobe, what's up?  Hey, man.  I'm an A&R rep for Epic Records.  Oh, Kobe.  Epic.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, we hung out about seven years ago at Roselands when you guys...  I remember that.  Yep.  We...  Chris passed me some bad tabs of acid.  I think it was toilet tissue.  We're doing them all day, nothing's happening.  So, here's a real funny story.  We went in the back to the toilets, and we got some duty, and we smeared it all over Chris' 
[00:37:00]  the band's guitars on the strings, and we tucked them back into the cases, and the guys  went up on stage, and they were playing, and the stink was killing them, and I think  halfway through the set, what happened?  You guys had to switch your guitars or something?  I've really missed you, Kobe.  Those are the happiest days of my life.  Where have you been?  Is this a real story?  Do you remember any of that?  What are you talking about?  It's a real story, you pot-smoking loser.  What are you talking about there, you junkie?  Jackass. 
[00:37:30]  Sounds like a good story.  I think it was one of those guys that thought maybe you were a little overexposed.  Yeah, I think so.  To call earlier.  Yeah, he's one of the overexposure guys, I think.  That's funny.  Yeah, smearing duty on the guitar string.  Duty.  It makes you play fast.  Yeah, and it sounds great when you use a slide on human feces.  That's really good.  You've got to be human.  Hey, Michael, what's going on?  Hey, OPA, how are you doing?  All right.  Hey, Chris, they said it was your vocal cords.  They said that was health reasons, or was that mentally? 
[00:38:00]  You know, I really don't know.  Honest to God, I don't know whether it was psychological.  Did you just need a good excuse?  That could happen.  All I know is I would open up my mouth and be like,  Hi, how are you doing?  I've heard of that, though.  I could have it.  You just lose your voice because of something in your head, you know?  You're like, oh, my God.  Yeah.  You're stressed or something like that.  Yeah, you know, I really, honestly, I don't know.  I did everything.  I did, like, acupuncture, Chinese herbs, you know, just crazy, crazy.  Was the band fighting at that point in time, or, I mean, after the second hour? 
[00:38:30]  I mean, this was actually in, like, this was just a couple years ago, so this was one of  the, like, later versions of the record.  We made a really cool record.  I mean, if you want to go hear a really cool Spin Doctors record, go check out Here Comes  the Bride.  It was, like, the last record that we made.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, it was about, you know, two weeks before the record came out, I had this really severe  cold, and I woke up one morning, and, you know, we were, like, a loud, loud band, so  it was nothing for me to wake up in the morning and have my voice really shot. 
[00:39:00]  So, usually by about lunchtime, my voice would be back.  Lunchtime comes, voice isn't back.  Night, voice doesn't come back.  But I wasn't really worried because I've lost my voice, like, zillions of times.  My voice has always been a mule, a mule.  I mean, I used to sing over this loud, loud band.  Yeah, you had some serious range, I remember that.  Well, thank you.  Yeah, we were really loud.  I used to sing really loud.  You know, I punctured an eardrum because the band was so loud.  I went to the doctor.  The doctor was like, why didn't you puncture your eardrum?  I was like, I don't know.  I used to stand next to a guy who played searingly loud guitar.  Would that do it? 
[00:39:30]  Seven years?  The doctor was like, yeah, that would do it.  But everything points to you having LSD.  I beg your pardon?  Everything points to you having LSD, which is lead singer disease, you know what I mean?  Oh, well, lead singer disease.  LSD.  You know what I mean?  Like, you were just too pompous for the band.  Oh, I'm as bad as any of them.  But I don't think it was your fault.  I mean, you seem to be pretty mellow.  I was, I'm as bad as any of them.  You get a reputation for being the pain in the ass of the band?  Difficult, difficult to work with.  You know, I'm probably as big a pain in the ass as any 22-year-old who's selling like 
[00:40:00]  around 5,000 records a week.  You got caught up in it a little bit, did you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, I mean, I didn't think I was caught up in it.  I thought I was like the most humble guy in the world.  Right.  I don't think I was, I don't think I was as bad as like, say, you know, Axl Rose or anything  like that.  I think I would fall somewhere between like Axl Rose and Pete Seeger.  Who must have been the easiest guy ever.  Exactly.  Nothing in his rider.  Hey, Josh.  Just have a room for me with a chair in it. 
[00:40:30]  Josh, what's up?  Yeah, Chris's album was like five people I know.  The first album we ever got.  Now I'm like 24 years old.  So it's just crazy to hear from him again.  Yeah, he just disappeared.  I mean.  For quite a while there.  But some of the songs, like, how could you want him when you know you could have me?  Hey, sorry, sorry, sorry.  You like that song.  Yeah, that is a good song.  He effing liked it.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  It's good to hear from you again and definitely be checking out your stuff. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, thanks, Josh.  Cool.  Josh, let's go to Kim.  Kim, what's up?  Hey, Kim.  Kim.  You can hear her in the background.  It says, my girlfriend had a shirt that said, someone killed the spin doctor.  Jim.  Jim.  Whatever.  You know I'm talking to you.  No, I didn't.  Not in the 80s.  I'm sorry.  He's on the phone going, no, my name's Jim.  They're saying Kim.  Even though this voice is talking to me.  Oh, that's right over the phone. 
[00:41:30]  It's talking to me.  Go ahead, Jim.  Yeah, we hated that band so much.  She actually did.  Used to wear it around her college.  She heard it said, somebody please kill the spin doctors.  It was one of the most popular shirts in college.  Yeah.  You were one of those bands that, like, the real hard rockers were like, hey, if them pussy.  Yeah, right.  You know?  And if you were into the spin doctors, you weren't.  You know, it's weird because we were, we were, we started out, we were super culty.  You know?  Yeah.  In, like, New York, we were playing, we had, like, this huge repertoire of songs. 
[00:42:00]  You know?  And you put out an album, and the album's really popular, and that's what you have to play  live, and that's what people hear.  But we actually had, like, a hundred tunes.  And we would play a different set every night.  We would play these, like, we had all kinds of tunes.  We had tunes that were really, like, you know, as hard as, as, you know, a lot of stuff that  was coming.  We were, like, people thought we were a grunge band.  People thought we were a pop band.  You know, it was, we sort of defied genre.  And then we, then you get out there, and it's like, you got these two tunes on the radio.  You know?  And that's what people know.  And that's what you are.  And that's what you are. 
[00:42:30]  And you're, like, defined by this, like, happy-go-lucky kind of thing.  Right, right.  And we were, you know, I mean, that was definitely a big part of what we were doing, but we were  also, you know, pretty, pretty edgy band with, you know, some, some pretty dark stuff.  Yeah.  So, you know, we were as cynical as anybody, but, um, but you're famous for this, like,  happy-go-lucky kind of thing.  Right, right, right.  I'm getting distracted because there's, like, six to eight really hot girls outside.  I think they're the ones that are going to be trying out.  Oh, they're trying out.  It's a box of sex toys.  Yeah, there's a box of toys over there, and they're going to do some stuff. 
[00:43:00]  Can I, can I plug this tune?  Yeah.  Because I'm not really on here to, like, talk about me, although I, I wouldn't mind  talking about me for the rest of the show, but.  You can hang, man.  We can, when we, you know, we have some stuff going on in here if you want to watch.  All right.  Do you want to talk about this?  Yeah, hell yeah, man.  That's why we got you in here.  No, it's a great cause.  So you got a new song out called, uh, We're All New Yorkers Now.  Yeah, I wrote this tune for, um, you know, for the, for the, um, the, uh, Twin Towers Fund,  you know, it costs five bucks.  You can order it on my website, chrisbarron.com.  It costs five bucks. 
[00:43:30]  All of the money is, uh, is going to, um, the Twin Towers Fund.  I, I put up all the money to, to manufacture it myself and all that kind of stuff.  So, I mean, no money is going anywhere, but the, the Twin Towers Fund.  Cool.  And, um, you know, it's like a nice uplifting kind of tune.  It's not, you know, a real downer or anything like that.  What area of, uh, New York you live in?  Uh, downtown.  Downtown?  Yeah.  So, yeah, it really gets home.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I used to look out, were you in town?  I used to look out my window and, and, you know, it was like the Twin Towers.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  It was like, you know, I had this great view and it was, you know, this, this great, this  great thing.  I was in town.  You were in town?  But I was dropping my daughter off at, uh, at daycare, so I didn't happen to be in the  neighborhood when I was in town.  Shocker, man.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Someone wants to know if you can live off the royalties from your spin doctor days.  Yeah.  Did you sign a good deal?  Oh, yeah, I'm doing fine.  Did you sign a good deal for that?  Yeah.  Okay.  We got a smile out of them.  I'm doing okay.  Any car companies or anything call you up for the rights to songs?  Stuff like that?  A lot of people are doing that now.  Um, no, I wish they would.  It used to be bad.  I wish they would. 
[00:44:30]  I wish they would.  I know.  It used to be that your credibility would be shot if all of a sudden you're a popular  band and, uh, you know, you end up on a car commercial.  On a commercial, it was like, it was like the kiss of death.  And then you see STP's pumping them out left and right.  In fact, a major beer company that I'm, like, not really allowed to mention used, uh, used  Two Princes for an ad and we ended up in this big lawsuit with them because it was like,  you can't do that.  You're wrecking our cred.  Yeah.  I've had a change of heart about that one.  Larry, what's up?  Yeah, right, yeah.  Orny, what's up?  We're talking to Chris from the Spin Doctors. 
[00:45:00]  Hey, hey, I talked to you the other night on Lawn and Fez, remember?  Fantastic.  What?  So what do you got, Larry?  No, oh, I want to say hi to Chris.  Okay.  Hi, Larry.  Um, Chris, it's a personal question, but sometimes the voice goes when you use too much cocaine.  Right?  Right or wrong?  You know what?  I've never been into cocaine.  No?  You know, I tried it a few times and, um.  You were a big smoker?  I was a pot smoker, man.  I was a serious pothead.  He looks like a pothead.  I started.  Don't ruin your voice, though. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, hey, Anthony, remember the other night with that girl?  Thank you, Larry.  I like that whenever you hear remember and then insert this here, I will never remember.  So don't even try.  Do you remember the time?  No.  You still spoke the weed there, Chris?  No, no, I quit.  No.  I quit when my daughter was.  Oh, right.  See?  We were going to offer this.  Changed your life, right?  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to visit to the stairwell, but.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  No, I would have in the old days.  I started smoking pot when I was nine.  Nine?  Nine.  Who gave you your first?  Oh, I shouldn't get into that. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, really?  I should get her into trouble.  Oh, okay.  Was it family?  Yeah, yeah.  It was like a family kind of thing.  It has to be the uncle.  My brother got me into pot.  I was like the nerdiest kid, man.  I had my microscopes, chemistry sets.  I was really doing well in school.  And my brother was like the lowlife, man, the teachers.  When I would go to school the next year and get some of the same teachers, they'd look  at me like, oh, another piece of crap.  And I'd have to prove myself.  And then he gave me my first joint.  My schoolwork went down the crap. 
[00:46:30]  It's amazing.  I threw the science stuff away.  Just wanted to hang out and do nothing.  Yep.  And that's pretty much where my life went.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  It really is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's great when you're doing it because, you know, watching cartoons and hanging out with  your friends, there's nothing better.  Kung Fu movies.  Kung Fu movies.  Kung Fu theater.  Kung Fu theater.  Your style is no good.  My grandmother could beat you up.  I was a Warner Brothers cartoon kind of guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was sitting there watching the same Bugs Bunny over and over again.  Yeah.  We would watch like these cartoons and we'd be like, you know, watching Popeye's, look 
[00:47:00]  at the, there's five leaves on all the, on all the house plants.  It's like, why is Fred running past the same couch and window every time?  And his house must be huge.  Right.  All right.  We have to take a break.  You going to hang with us today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Absolutely.  But we're not going to get you in trouble.  You got to see these ladies outside the studio.  Hey, you all right?  I'll be okay.  As long as they leave everyone alone.  As long as girls get a little overzealous.  All right.  It's Chris Barron from the Spin Doctors.

All money going towards a great cause, obviously.  Yes, the relief.  Anthony, we've got Vanilla Ice outside the studio.  We've got Vanilla Ice.  We've got porn stars outside the studio and they're loving Vanilla Ice.  Are they?  Big time.  They're all over. 
[00:48:30]  Like flies on flypaper.  Now, you've never met Vanilla Ice?  No, I never have.  I never have.  The guys were around about the same time though, right?  I think he's a little before.  A little old school?  Yeah, he was like old.  I think he's more like oldie schoolie.  Kicking it oldie schoolie?  Oldie schoolie.  He was like 91.  91.  93-ish.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, just passed each other somewhere.  Hey, Big Kev's on the line.  Big Kev, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  What's happening, Kev?  I'm down here at the National Comic Book Art Toy and Sci-Fi Expo Extravaganza. 
[00:49:00]  You are always at these.  Big Kev is a friend of the show.  He's always at these events where the people sitting, signing autographs.  He goes to all the nerds.  The years go by.  The nerd shows.  The nerd shows.  The Star Trek convention stuff.  Comic book.  Action figure things.  He was hanging out with the cast of F-Troop last time.  F-Troop.

[00:49:30]  Wrangler Jane.  What she looked like.  She was really, really hot.  Really cute.  Well, I have a surprise in store for you today.  Big Kev, who have you brought us today?  I have a very spry Soupy sale.  Oh, Jesus.  We don't want to talk to Soupy sale.  What are we going to say to Soupy?  Hold on.  He'd like to say hi to you.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  Kid show host from many years ago.  And you might remember him on WMBC.  Hey, Opie Anthony.  What's up, Soupy? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, you guys do a little bit.  Soupy, how are you?  Fine.  Thanks, yourself.  I'll tell you, it is a thrill to speak with you.  I used to listen to you when you were on WMBC.  Oh, yeah.  When I'm drunk, I sleep anyplace.  Exactly.  What?  And I remember listening to you back then.  And what are you doing these days, Mr. Sales?  Well, let me see.  I'm here for the next two or three days at the Metropolitan Pavilion.  It didn't last that long.  Chris, is this what you sounded like when your vocal cord got paralyzed? 
[00:50:30]  It's not that good.  Really?  Not that good.  And I'm going to be in Westport, Maine next Friday.  Really?  And what?  You're doing shows?  Soupy?  Yeah.  You get up on stage and you tell some of the old jokes and stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  I do stage that.  And we're doing a thing called Soupy's Video Vault.  Soupy's Video Vault.  So, now, let me get this straight.  You're on stage.  Behind you is a video screen.  And it shows, like, when the naked lady got you backstage on the Soupy Sales Show. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of clips you've never seen.  Oh, there's clips we haven't seen.  A crumpet, my guess.  No, that was Buddy Emston, Opie.  Oh, right.  I got a few movies.  I got a couple movies coming out.  Movies coming out?  Yeah.  What are you starring in there, Soupy?  This train is called.  Uh-huh.  And we're going to call a little bit of lipstick.  We're going to call, dude, I think.  We're going to call Palmer's Pickup.  Wow.  You're a busy man, Soupy.  Soupy. 
[00:51:30]  How old of a man are you these days?  I'm 75, but there's one good reason why I think they're being 75.  Yeah.  No more calls from insurance agents.  Ah, there we go.  That's a good one.  There's a zinger from Soupy.  And also, I got my new book.  It's due out in the 15th of this month.  A book.  What is it?  Like a biography of Soupy?  Yeah, a biography.  Biography.  Biography.  It covers your days as a kid show host and your stint as the afternoon guy at WAMBC. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The whole ball wax.  I remember listening to him.  He was like, and here's the piano player, Daryl B. Moore, to come.  I remember that.  You had a piano player on your show.  Yeah, yeah.  That was great.  Wow.  I'm happy you guys enjoyed it because I enjoy you guys.  You're wonderful.  Thank you, Soupy Sales.  Well, we'll be looking out for everything you're working on these days.  Sounds like you're still a busy man, even at 75.  Well, as long as you have your health and a roof over your mouth, you have good shape. 
[00:52:30]  A roof over your mouth.  There you go.  Okay.  And we'll always say, just remember, never buy a TV except for a man on the street.  It's out of breath.  Hey, Soupy, you under the weather a little bit?  I say that, too.  I say it all the time.  Huh?  No, I'm feeling fine.  You're feeling fine?  Yeah.  You don't have the anthrax or anything?  No, no.  Thank God.  Clear.  Okay.  All right, can we put Big Kev back on the phone, Soupy? 
[00:53:00]  Yes, we just did.  All right.  Yeah, Big Kev.  The great Soupy Sales.  Hey, guys.  Oh, God.  Kev, how depressing is it?  Extremely.  How old does he look?  What did he tell you?  He said he's 75.  I'd had about 75.  Really that bad?  Oh, yeah.  So he's not sick or anything?  That's how he is now?  He's sad.  Like, his voice is really gravelly.  Hey, Kev.  He's saving it for stand-up.  Hey, Kev, I'll give you 20 bucks if you give him the phone back and have him say, 
[00:53:30]  Well, Doggy, on our show.  Okay, hold on.  All right.  I want you to say, Well, Doggy.  Well, Well, Doggy.  Well, Doggy.  All right.  There we go.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do that.  Well, Doggy.  No, that's not how you do it.  You guys do the Well.  Well, Doggy.  All right.  Well, Doggy.  Well, Doggy.  Well, Doggy. 
[00:54:00]  You there?  You owe me 20 bucks.  You owe him 20 bucks.  That's a good 20 bucks, though, man.  He was doing dueling Well, Doggies with the recorded voice of Buddy Ebsen.  Who knew?  Man, that was actually Buddy Ebsen, Chris.  We had him on the phone quite a few times over the last few years.  And the first time we had him on, he did Well, Doggy.  Famous line from Beverly Hillbillies.  And it sounded just like he did back in the 60s when it was on. 
[00:54:30]  Now we have to play the whole day.  Now we got to play it.  It's okay, though.  I love hearing it.  And then we had him on a couple of years later, and it got worse.  And the last time he had it on was what you just heard there.  Sounds like a TIE fighter.  I think Big Kev's trying to say something.  Yes, Kev.  Yeah, I have a couple more really big stars here that I'm trying to hook up for you.  Who could you possibly be trying to get us?  Anthony, this one's especially for you.  Oh, God.  Kathy Garver.  Do you know who she is? 
[00:55:00]  Garver.  Captain Garver?  Kathy.  Kathy Garver.  Oh, Kathy Garver.  Yes.  She played Sissy on Family Affair.  Oh, my God.  She's a drug addict.  No, the drug addict is the younger one, and she's dead.  Oh.  Sissy with you.  And also the incredible Lou Ferrigno.  Lou Ferrigno?  You got Lou Ferrigno?  Get out of here.  The incredible Hulk.  So that's what I'm working on.  I'll call you guys back later.  All right.  Thank you, Kev. 
[00:55:30]  Bye.  Bye.  How about that?  Soupy sales.  Wow.  You know, it sounds like he went to the Marlon Brando School of Elocution.  I thought he was under the weather, man.  Yeah, I thought he had pneumonia or something.  I thought he was ready to call 911.  Another stellar interview, courtesy of Big Kev.  Thanks, Kev.  Yeah.  Kev gets us all.  You know who Kev's gotten us in the past?  The robot from Lost in Space.  He got us that.  But don't be confused.  No, not the guy that you heard going, warning, warning.  It was the guy in the suit. 
[00:56:00]  Not the voice.  Not the voice.  It's not like we want the voice guy to maybe do a couple of lines and characters.  It was the guy in the suit.  The little short guy talking about how it was to get into the suit.  Fantastic.  Well, just when you thought the show couldn't get any better.  Right.  Vanilla Ice is up next, Anthony.  Vanilla Ice.  With strippers.  With strippers.  Porn stars.  Porn stars, actually.  Wow.  And a box of sex toys in the corner.  You going to stick around, Chris?  Wow.  Yeah, I can stick around for a while.  Cool.  What does he have to do?  If I'm invited.  Oh.  You are cordially invited. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  We'll be back.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail to the kings of the radio.  Hey, Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  You'll love Paisano.  Help Joey out.  He's kind of bummed that that Islander lost last night.  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  Signs might say all over.  Avoid Lower Manhattan.  But you can't avoid Mulberry Street in Little Italy. 
[00:57:00]  Great food down there.  And go to Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Incredible, authentic Italian cuisine.  Made from old world Italian recipes.  And priced right.  Take the whole family there.  You're not going to go broke.  The portions are huge, so you take some home with you.  And they have the incredible pasta lunch specials, too.  So it's not just for dinner.  Ask for Joey, the owner.  You get a glass of wine on the house.  Well, maybe not in this day and age.  Does he still give away the glass of wine?  Of course he does.  What a trooper Joey is.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  It's in the heart of Little Italy.  136 Mulberry.  Call them up.  965-1188.

Hey, do you remember the band The Spin Doctors?  Of course I remember them.  Little Miss Can't Be Wrong and Two Princes.  Yeah, what, what?  Oh, yeah, hi.  Embarrassed me.  Embarrassed me.  I'm not, you know, I'm not big on the white boy music.  They're trying to, as I culture them in musical theater,  they culture me in the white boy music. 
[00:58:30]  Somehow he's very up on every Broadway show and a tune.  Start spreading the news.  I have to sing New York, New York everywhere I can.  You can either pick up rubble or sing New York, New York,  and that's what I'm going to do.  I'm singing New York, New York.  I've got to sing it for the president and everybody.  I need pancakes.  Thank you so much.  Aren't you one of the fellas that dances in back of me?  You're Sebastian.  Sebastian, give me some water and find me my low notes. 
[00:59:00]  I can't find them.  What the hell?  What the hell?  Where's that low note?  It just curled away like a tarantula.  We're going to have to set up more microphones.  There's hookers in the hallway.  Have you seen some of the ladies out there?  I've seen some of the chicks.  One of them did not have implants, which I was happy to say.  They were nice little...  Turn my mic on.  I'm sure scared.  I barged right in.  Chris, do you know Mario Cantone? 
[00:59:30]  Not personally.  Did you?  Now, Mario, it's nice to see you.  Hello, Mr. Spin Doctor.  I have a problem I'd like to talk to you about.  My head is spinning from the hookers in the hallway.  Chris, do you remember...  What's wrong with our hookers?  Oh, the hookers are a delight.  And Vanilla Ice, he's a very illustrated man with the tattoos.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's a Ray Bradbury novel, that one, let me tell you.  You like that?  No, I don't really.  No, you're not into the tats?  No, I mean, it depends.  He doesn't do it for me.  I'm a nice guy, but I'm not a true thing.  He's attractive, no. 
[01:00:00]  No, no.  Hey, Chris, where's that accommodator thing I was showing you?  I gave it back to you.  You gave it back to me?  Quickly.  Oh, my God.  Quickly.  Mario, hi.  We've got a whole box of sex toys in the corner.  Oh, I can't wait to strap one on.  I want to ask you if you would try this one.  No, I'm not going to try it, because you know what I'm saying?  I love you, fellas, but if I cut off another girl's clothes in the studio, my card will  be taken away.  All right?  It'll be snatched.  We had Mario cutting a girl's clothes off in the studio. 
[01:00:30]  I cut a girl's clothes off.  Yeah.  Scissors, knives.  She was into it.  She, like, got off on guys cutting her clothes off.  Well, thank God someone was into it.  Yeah, she wasn't.  She was looking at me like, I've never had my clothes cut off by someone that didn't know  that didn't know that didn't know that didn't know that I'm telling you guys,  seriously.  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.  Can I show you something?  Yeah, what is it?  Would you use this with your partner?  It's called the...  My partner.  You're so politically correct.  What is it?  Partner.  Hey, partner.  I love that you said that.  No, I'm busting your balls. 
[01:01:00]  Your boyfriend?  I don't know.  No, my whatever.  Your lover?  My...  No, you can say partner.  Your one-night stand?  What?  My hookers!  Ask me that!  Would I use something with my hookers?  What?  That's about...  Oh, it goes on the chin.  ...the most ridiculous thing you've ever seen.  Look, that's the Jay Leno dildo.  That's unbelievable.  The Leno.  It's wrapped onto the chin.  Would you use something as ridiculous as this?  Never.  I think that's ridiculous.  A latex dong.  I love that it's a dong.  I'm going to have some guests come out.  I'm going to strap in your dildo.  I don't even need one.  It's fabulous.  I'm going to put a dildo in. 
[01:01:30]  He doesn't even need one of those.  He could just...  All right, listen.  We've got to get Vanilla Ice in here.  Yes.  Vanilla Ice.  I think he sang backup for me one time.  Hey, Chris, did you...  You grew up in New York?  There he is.  No.  No, you didn't.  All around.  Mostly New Jersey.  I called the Illustrated.  Oh, because he was a host of a kid's show, Steampipe Alley, many years ago.  Yeah.  They actually let him work with children.  I had a kid's show.  They actually let him work with children.  I modeled a character after you named Italian Ice.  Hey, you did.  How come out there you shook my hand and in here you're talking so friendly?  Hey, because I'm a rude comedian. 
[01:02:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm nice out there, you know.  All right.  But now Ice.  Well, it's Robert.  Robert.  I will call him Robert.  Robert Van Winkle.  Robert Van Winkle.  And his cousin Rip.  That's it.  I'm sleeping forever.  Robert, I want to introduce everyone.  I like him.  Robert, that's Mario Cantone.  Yeah.  Very funny guy and he's on Sex and the City a lot.  Yeah.  That little HBO show.  Yeah, the chick show that you watch every Sunday.  You set that timer.  That Tebow's ready for you.  And that's Chris Barron, the lead singer of The Spin Doctor.  I recognize you.  How you doing, man? 
[01:02:30]  How you doing?  Good to see you.  Oh, my God.  I'm spinning.  See?  Look at you.  I love it.  I want to hold hands and sing We Are the World.  And maybe Michael Jackson's new song, I Can't Get Enough of the World.  You sound like Chris Catan, man.  Well, I do.  I sound like Chris Catan.  Yeah, well, guess what?  He's got a job.  You work.  And a major motion picture.  On Sex and the City?  Yeah, I'm on Sex and the City.  Yeah, see?  You're on Sex and the City.  But I'm not on Weekly.  I'm only on as a reoccurring girl.  Even though I'm not complaining, I'm quite good on it.  I'm quite good on it.  And the show's terrific.  And it won the Emmy this year, ladies and gentlemen.  Were you there?  And the award for Best Comedy Series in the City. 
[01:03:00]  But you don't get an Emmy.  No, I'm not going to get it.  What am I going to get an Emmy for?  But next year, I'm going to be nominated.  I'm going to submit myself for Best Guest Star.  I am.  You should.  I don't know when I'm going to get nominated, but I'm going to get nominated.  Hey, stop cursing.  I'm sorry.  I can't help it.  And let Robert get a word in here.  I'm sorry, Robert.  Go ahead.  It's all about him now, Mario.  Robert, you ever watch Steam Pipe Alley back in the 80s?  That kid's show?  No one remembers Steam Pipe Alley.  Oh, are you?  I'm aware of it.  By the ladies out there in the lobby that was telling me all about it. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, you know.  You're her hero back there.  The young Urbanites love me.  They do, huh?  They do.  They really do.  She wants to come in here and perform for you.  What does she want to do, Robert?  Because I can't change it.  Well, you're going to have to take that up with her.  I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, um.  They're doing some pretty freaky stuff over there, so.  I'm off drinking.  How many could slap on the chin?  I don't know.  Yeah, I'm not drinking.  I'm not smoking.  I'm not eating carbs, sugar.  I'm draining, so I'm a raving lunatic lately. 
[01:04:00]  More so than usual.  Oh, I'm the worst.  You have no idea.  I'm draining.  And I'm on hydro cuts to lose weight.  And then I'm going to Napa Valley to fall off it and drink and drive.  It is so much work to be a gay man in New York.  It is so much work.  The pressure is brutal.  The pressure is brutal.  It has to be flat, flat, flat.  I hate them all.  I hate all of you.  It's like a lot of work.  You're preventing my stomach, my obsessive compulsive stomach issues.  But I look damn good. 
[01:04:30]  Now get out of my way.  I've got a man waiting for me.  Oh, God.  Robert's going to leave, man.  Well, Robert.  Robert's not a phobe.  He's pretty cool.  But you're scaring him in general.  It has nothing to do with being a bowl.  All right.  I'm going to be quiet.  Robert's got some new stuff.  Take a pill.  Out.  Take a pill.  Which one?  Wellbutrin?  Yeah, wellbutrin.  Do you want any?  Adderall.  What do you take?  Prozac?  Nothing.  Would I be like this if I was on wellbutrin?  What's your flavor?  My flavor?  Chocolate.  Maybe mocha. 
[01:05:00]  But definitely not vanilla.  Thank God.  I like vanilla.  He doesn't like the tattoos.  I like vanilla.  Thank God.  We did ask you.  We asked Mario about you.  He said no way.  No, I didn't say no way.  I just said you're adorable.  He has to be so cuter.  Closer.  What about the spin doctor?  I love the spin doctor.  He's got that health and magic look.  He's very cute.  Health and magic.  Would you spin him around?  No, I wouldn't spin him around.  Maybe he's a chorus boy in my bathroom.  We have to get this detailed. 
[01:05:30]  Wellbutrin, yeah.  If I was like, please.  You know what?  I should take Xanx is what I should do.  All right.  No, I'll.  No, I'll.  We got to see.  Oh, my God.  Tic Tacs.  You know, these are so good.  Suck on your favorite flavor.  Chocolate mint.  These are too small.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Hey, baby, hey.  You want to mess with me?  I'm going to mess with your back.  Let's go.  Bring it on.  Where are the hookers?  Mario, I'm going to turn. 
[01:06:00]  Turn your mic off.  All right.  We got to talk to Robert.  All right.  I'm sorry, Robert.  Fidel Ice.  Too much Richard Simmons this morning for Mario.  Too much Christopher Lowell.  You're going to help us when the girl...  You were exercising with him before you got it.  Yeah.  I would stretch into the classics.  Can we talk to Robert?  I'm quiet.  He's talking to me.  We're having a very good conversation.  I see.  I know him from years ago.  Are you kidding me?  We're both children of the 80s.  I'm a child of the 60s, but I won't say anything.  Beep me again. 
[01:06:30]  I'm sorry.  Just throw me off.  I am still in the process.  I'm just in shock.  I'm going to cough.  All right.  I'm just in shock.  I don't think you can be quiet for 30 seconds.  This is like that movie Magic with Anthony Hopkins.  I don't think you can do it.  You can't make the dummy not talk.  That's right.  The difference between me and Anthony Hopkins and Magic is I have one personality.  But you're still talking.  All right.  I'm quiet.  Go ahead, Robert.  I apologize.  It's got to be ADD.  Attention to the state disorder, right? 
[01:07:00]  I had ADD as a kid.  Mario can't shut up.  Adderall.  Adderall.  No, because you know what?  Once you take that stuff, it's over.  Yeah?  The talent goes.  You'd look at Barbra Streisand.  She was great.  Now she's in therapy.  She's not together.  Really?  Because of the drugs?  I think it takes away your edge.  I mean, if I did that stuff, I couldn't get on stage.  I'd be, you know, I think Osama bin Laden's got to be on stage.  I do, because he's so evil, but yet so calm. 
[01:07:30]  It's very scary.  Dude, what are you on?  Nothing.  No, you're on something.  I know what he's on.  He says he's trying to get himself down.  But something has knocked you into another planet.  I know.  Well, because I knew I had to come in here and be funny, because I've been on a million times,  and I have to continue to top myself, because the pressure kills me.  You don't have to.  Well, I want to be good for you, boys.  Look, you've got the spin doctor guy in Vanilla Ice.  I just want to be good for you, boys.  All right?  Is that okay?  I want to talk to Robert about all the...  Okay, you've got to take your baby.  You've got to take your baby. 
[01:08:00]  You can't shut up.  All right, I'll be quiet.  That's opium, man.  Opium.  That's Afghanian opium.  That's what it is.  If I had opium, I'd be laying on the floor.  He's going to kick your ass in a minute.  Peyote or something.  I feel a warmth from Robert.  Yeah, don't give me a baseball bat.  Yeah.  Whatever you do, I'll trash the set and kick me out.  All right.  I want to know a little bit about how it was getting from the Vanilla Ice of the early 90s  to where he's at now and what he's doing now.  Hmm, my diary.  It's been a roller coaster, man. 
[01:08:30]  You know, because that is one persona that it would seem to me would be very hard to get  away from.  Yeah.  And do the type of music you're doing now.  Yeah, no doubt.  I've got a song about it, actually.  Do you?  I can't get away from myself.  Yeah, it's funny.  During the time, though, in the early 90s, you were riding high, you know?  You're doing very well, making a lot of money.  Were you thinking to yourself, uh-oh, you know, I'm going to fall into this and not  going to be able to get out?  Yeah, but, you know, at that time, there was nobody before me to really use as a guideline, 
[01:09:00]  so I had to basically...  Herman Munster, I believe.  I went into...  He went into that role, and that was all he was, so that's the only...  I kind of went into the whole thing blindfolded, you know?  Yeah.  And, uh...  Did you have people, like, kind of, yeah, this is what you got to do, and you do this,  and you'll be huge?  Oh, totally.  I mean, it was a lot of fabrication, you know?  But I was paid millions of dollars to do it, and...  Ah!  I think anybody in my shoes at that time would have done the same thing, you know?  Oh, yeah.  So you really can't hate on it, but, you know, the deal was, uh, I was playing a role,  kind of a puppet thing, and, you know, I'm very grateful for what I'm doing now, 
[01:09:30]  because it's not about, you know, some phony gimmick made up from the record company,  you know?  Right.  And that's what that was all about, just kind of putting together a character and running  with it, and...  Hey, whatever worked.  We sold 17 million records.  I was going along with it, you know?  They made me cater to the younger audience, you know, with the baggy pants and the hairdo  and stuff and the dancing.  Who can forget that, man?  And I got to say that, you know, it's a true story.  Video killed the radio star, but, you know, music shouldn't be about a gimmick or an image.  It should be about, you know, effing music, you know?  And that's what I'm about now.  You know, it's kind of anti-image and everything, so... 
[01:10:00]  Did you hate your image at the time?  Yeah, totally.  You did, man.  Oh, totally, man.  I mean, I came in, you know, I'm a hip-hop dude, and I came in with fat gold ropes and,  you know, saggy pants.  I mean, just totally everything, hip-hop, and then, you know, they change it and they  polish it up, and I say no, and they say, what do you want me to do?  Wow.  Were you, like, unhappy?  Were you very unhappy during that time, though?  Yeah, I was.  Yeah, it was very depressing.  I actually had $20 million in the bank in 1994, and, by the way, I've still made great investments.  I still got a lot of it. 
[01:10:30]  I was going to ask you.  But, yeah, I'm not MC Hammer's story here.  No bankruptcy.  That is tragic.  But I learned a valuable lesson that I tried to commit suicide then, you know.  The depression set in very badly, and, you know, I was using the drugs as an escape route.  How do you try to kill yourself?  Heroin, ecstasy, cocaine.  Yeah, I left a suicide note.  My friends dumping buckets of cold water on me and stuff.  I'm in convulsions.  The whole ugly scene.  I mean, I'm probably going, what is this guy, an a-hole?  You know, you're very successful, very wealthy, taken care of for the rest of your life, and 
[01:11:00]  you're trying to kill yourself.  It was because of the whole image that you had.  Yeah, the whole thing, man.  I just couldn't find any happiness, and money wasn't going to buy it for me.  And, you know, mansions and cars and everything only goes so far, and after that, the thrill's  gone.  And so I couldn't buy my self-happiness, and just, you know, I wanted to escape.  That's why I'm glad I'm poor.  I learned everything the hard way, man.  But it's good, you know.  Yeah.  I'm beyond those days.  And then the girls throwing themselves at you must have been something also.  I still get it every day, man.  It's unbelievable. 
[01:11:30]  Unbelievable.  A lot of sluts out there.  Thank God.  These girls were all over him outside.  Really?  Oh, my God.  See, he just walks around, and girls throw themselves at you.  Dude, I could be meatloaf.  Come on, I'm an entertainer.  You know, everybody in here.  Same made you handsome as Mickey Rooney would say.  I mean, look at even George Michael, you know.  He don't even have any interest in women, you know.  Right.  And he'd go out, wham.  Well, the girls seem to enjoy the way he looks.  The tight pants.  Doesn't matter. 
[01:12:00]  Look at the other guy from Wham.  He got nothing.  Well, we've got to ask him about Madonna, because everyone's calling about that.  And that's in People Magazine, I guess.  Come on, you're on the cover of People Magazine, the latest issue.  Inquiring minds want to know.  But Donna's men, in the long line of photos of her guys, they show on the cover.  The best is Michael Jackson.  She couldn't get anything going on with Michael.  Of course.  Yeah, one of these people do not belong on this cover.  Michael Jackson.  She tried, and he didn't want anything to do with that.  No, I didn't think so.  Tell him to try Viagra. 
[01:12:30]  But you...  Madonna doesn't do it.  Viagra won't do it either.  So, yeah, you were with her for a short time, I guess, right?  Yeah, eight months, actually, yeah.  What years were that?  Man, you're asking me.  After I've had too many 420 time breaks, short-term and long-term memory loss, it was like 92, 93.  Yeah, so you're both pretty hot in the industry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  It was a wild ride.  Was she using you because you were pretty much exposed there, and you're using her because she's Madonna kind of thing? 
[01:13:00]  I didn't know the reason.  She came on to me.  You know, it was a concert I was playing here in the city, and she just came on to me, and I was like blown away.  How the hell does that work, right?  My friends were even like, dude, you're bagging Madonna?  I'm like...  And I had to kind of step out of my skin and go, I am.  Jesus.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah, well, that's some resume stuff.  She's older than me, you know, is like the oldest lady I've ever been with, but she's extremely sexy, and she's hot.  She's Madonna.  And it was, you know, without gory details or anything, it ranks up there in your exploits of your life there? 
[01:13:30]  No, the sex, it ain't got no flames coming out of her or nothing like that.  Nothing like that?  No supernatural Madonna sex flames?  I've had a lot better.  I've had a lot better.  Really?  Yeah, big time.  Well, look who you're talking to also, all right?  The curve is probably pretty high.  Who's better than Madonna?  He's got a lot of...  No famous people or nothing, just...  No, I want to ask another question about Madonna.  What was the emotional relationship in your life?  Oh, leave it to him.  Come on, I want to know.  Leave it to him with the emotional part of it. 
[01:14:00]  Was she nice to you?  Was she controlling?  No, she was a sweetheart most of the time, but she has something about her that has, like, these different characters that, you know, you can wake up to at any given day,  and she actually believes that she's that character that day, you know?  Really?  And most people have, you know, two or three in them, but she's got, like, ten or so.  You mean, like Anne Heche?  She could be nice one day, she could be a bitch another day, that's normal, but she  goes into other characters, you know?  You just described every woman.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I'm saying, that's like most, but then she goes into other characters that  are, like, completely different, you know? 
[01:14:30]  Like, what would you say?  Well, like, now she moves to London, and all of a sudden, she talks like this, you know?  Yeah, she's got the accent.  I mean, and she really probably is not even aware of that, you know?  Yeah.  She's probably just picking up on that and just does that, but she's very hard to predict.  Hey, how did it end?  The sex book.  I believe it or not...  There's pictures of you in there, right?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Pictures of you having sex with Madonna.  Oh, jeez.  You're having sex with Madonna in the sex book?  No.  You let her snap pictures of you?  No.  Well, the whole deal was that they were taking pictures, you know? 
[01:15:00]  It was like leisure time, and I didn't know what was going to happen with these pictures  or anything.  Oh, boy.  And they ended up in this sex book.  There was another guy in some of the photos, too, right?  Well, the whole book had all kinds of different guys in there.  It was insane.  I'm talking about your pictures of Madonna.  No, no, no, no, no.  There's no other guys with me.  But I'll tell you what, man.  Yes, you're right.  It was me.  The whole thing was really weird was that it just threw me into that whole slutty package,  and I didn't want to be a part of it.  I knew that it was fabricated.  I knew she didn't live that lifestyle, and Liz, her publicist, was probably creating a lot  of this for her. 
[01:15:30]  The whole thing was just basically a big slutty package I really didn't want to be a part  of.  Right.  There was no permission to use the pictures of me in the thing or nothing, you know?  So that's what ended the whole deal.  Wow.  There was no permission at all?  No, they didn't ask me if you want to be in the book or anything about it.  I didn't even know anything about it until somebody told me, like a friend of mine,  dude, you're in the sex book with Madonna.  And I'm like, I am?  Oh, no.  Check this out.  And I looked through this whole thing, and I'm like, damn.  And there I am.  And I'm the one going out with her.  I just felt like a big sucker.  Yeah.  Did you say anything? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I had some words with her.  Oh, for sure.  I guess when you're bagging her, it kind of feels like she had permission to use it.  Yeah, it was pretty exciting.  Damn, that's rough.  You know, no matter what the moment is, you never let people take pictures of me like that.  Never.  Because you don't know where the hell they're going to go.  I told you, I learned everything the hard way.  And that was before the internet, really.  Nowadays, forget about it.  Yeah, no doubt.  You won't even get done having the sex that they're taking pictures of, and you pop it up  on the website.  Hey, wait a minute.  I'm still doing that.  No doubt.  What happened there?  Wow. 
[01:16:30]  That's good.  I also want to ask you about the other thing that everybody talks about, the Suge Knight  thing.  Right.  I don't know if that's a true urban legend, exaggeration.  Apparently, Suge held you out a window by your ankles.  Yeah, see, that's where the thing gets, you know, fabricated.  There's some truth to it.  He took me to a balcony, had me look over, and the story went from there to he's hanging  me by my ankles and all this crap, but no ankle hanging, nothing.  I got the idea.  You didn't have to do that, man. 
[01:17:00]  Come on.  Suge Knight in my hotel room before I check in with a whole entourage of football-looking  dudes, you know, that would beat you down like crazy.  I mean, I don't know if you've ever seen this guy in person, but his hands are, like, huge.  I mean, the guy's, like, seven feet tall.  Yeah.  What was the issue at hand there?  Publishing.  I mean, you know, I didn't even meet Suge Knight.  My record already sold, like, four million.  I was selling, like, a million a day, and, you know, he wanted a piece of it.  You know, he got Eazy-E, he got Jerry Heller, a whole bunch of people.  I mean, the list goes on.  But, uh... 
[01:17:30]  Now, how did he feel he was entitled to...  He wasn't entitled to anything.  I mean, I didn't even know who he was.  So he...  That's the way he does.  He's strong...  Pretty much extortion.  Yeah, I mean, you know, the thing is, is that I didn't go to police or nothing, you know?  I'm not going to put a target on my forehead.  And I told you, in, you know, the way I look at this whole thing is in a positive way.  In 94, I tried to kill myself, 20 million bucks, you know?  And this was in 92 or something when this was going on with Suge, so I'm not going to  worry about the four million that he got from me.  Right.  But the thing is, is that, you know, he had me sign these papers over all the publishing 
[01:18:00]  and everything, and it was pretty insane.  But I look at it in a positive way because, you know, basically, I contributed to Death  Row Records, which, you know, from that came the Chronic Record, some of the best hip-hop  music ever, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg.  Yeah, so you feel like you financed a little of that.  In an indirect, you know, way, I definitely, you know, had a lot to do, influence with all  that music coming up.  What was the conversation on the balcony?  Like, what did he say to you?  I got to know.  Dude, I got to know.  I don't even remember what he said. 
[01:18:30]  I mean, I got it, you know?  I got the idea.  I knew what was going on.  It didn't take a genius.  It was a no-brainer, you know?  He just came by with some papers for you to sign.  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much.  I mean, he knew where I was at at any given time all over L.A.  I mean, I could go to Benihana's, and he has informants there.  I could be coming in the airport, and he would, like, catch up at the Palm Restaurant  and stuff.  He would show up and just, and he was never mean.  You know, he wasn't like, hey, dude, I'm coming to get you.  He was just like, hey, how you doing?  It was nice, actually.  It was weird.  But then I started putting it all together.  This guy knows where I'm at at all times. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, man.  And, in fact, I checked into my hotel room, and he was in there.  Did some of your people say, why did you sign this?  What is this?  And how come this much money has to go there that no one questioned it?  It was my idea.  I mean, it was, you know, up to me.  So you're just...  Nobody else is going to control my decision.  Putting the shield up on your own ass.  Yeah.  Doing this.  It was just, you know, the guy came to me.  I got the picture.  Hey, take it.  Whatever.  You know?  I had plenty left over, so it wasn't that big of a deal.  Oh, wow.  Considering events that have happened since then, probably a wise move. 
[01:19:30]  Do you know what I'm saying?  I hear you.  And it's been years, and I really don't like talking about it, but I know that...  It's just one of those things that everybody has heard about, and, you know, the image  of you hanging by your ankles is kind of...  You know, I got my family.  I got my kids now.  I don't want to put a target on my forehead by going out and stirring things up.  So, you know, I try to pacify the thing as much as possible.  You did the guy right, I guess.  Yeah.  What the hell is he going to have a problem?  How many kids do you have?  I got two kids.  Two kids?  Yeah.  Two girls.  And you're married?  Yeah.  How long have you been married?  A couple years. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  So when you put that on...  Quiet!  I'm talking to him!  You know what?  I'll do the intelligent questions.  You'll do the trashy ones.  I want to know if you had pressures back then with, like, family members because you made  a lot of money.  Did you have people, like, ask you constantly for money as far as, like, family pressures  or friends?  No.  My family's been pretty cool.  They've been good.  Yeah.  That's good.  Really good.  Very supportive.  All right.  Robert, Robert, question for Mario from The Advocate.  Hey, hey, it's me.  That's me, it's me.  Hey, keep throwing those cheap shots.  You're going to get that Schweppes can up your ass. 
[01:20:30]  Ooh.  Ooh.  Nobody wants a Charlie in the box.  Rudolph, let go of my crank.  God damn.  Yeah.  So what's the new sound all about, Robert?  Man, it's just about being myself, doing what I want to do, you know?  It's bipolar, right?  Bipolar.  It's a double CD, 72 minutes.  Not to name, a diagnosis.  There you go.  Bipolar.  Yeah.  You know, it's not influenced by letting, you know, like radio, no offense or anything 
[01:21:00]  like that, you know, influence the way I make music.  You know, I don't know how long the songs are.  I mean, of course, they time them.  But, you know, radio has these limitations and everything.  And I make my music the way I want to make it now, you know?  It's not about anything else other than just me and my expression.  That's what music should be about.  Right.  One CD's all hardcore.  The other one is hip-hop, you know?  Just released a record a couple years ago called Hard to Swallow.  Producer, Ross Robinson, who produced Limp Bizkit, Korn, Sepultura, Slipknot, a bunch 
[01:21:30]  of huge bands and stuff.  All hardcore.  And now that I got this one, I wanted to show people that I'm true to hip-hop because  that's my roots and, you know, I'm coming back to that.  So, I got the best of both worlds on it.  Bipolar.  Check it out.  Had to plug it.  Oh, yeah.  No problem with that.  Well, we got to take a break.  You're hanging, obviously.  We got to get some of these girls in here.  Yeah, we'll see what they're all about.  Everybody cool with hanging and watching some of the festivities, perhaps?  Yeah, me hanging out with me.  I'm not going anywhere.  Mario is.  Yes, right.  I'm out of here.  Come on, Mario. 
[01:22:00]  I've had it.  You dragged me in here today.  Come on, hang with the guy.  More on earth than I know.  What's the matter with you, man?  Hang out.  We're going to watch some chicks.  All right, I'm hanging.  We're going to watch some chicks.  It was a man moment.  It was a man moment.  I want to cut off some clothes.  Come on.  You didn't pull the hat off.  We don't even talk like that.  No, you don't.  You don't.  But, you know, I'm just doing my bipolar.  Hey.  There you go.  Hey, sweet.  I hugged you again.  All right.  It means a whole different thing.  Shut up! 
[01:22:30]  Okay.  I'm going to cheat, John.  I hear you.  Christ can't say nothing in here.  See, you know, let me tell you something about Robert over here.  What I see in his eyes is a lot more peace of mind.  That's what I see.  That's it.  Look at you.  Looking into the eye.  But you never let go of your anger.  Yeah.  That's right.  Because that's what it's all about.  What do you see in the spin doctor's eyes?  I see very calm.  I see, like, peace.  I see, like, Jesus a little bit.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  I see a very kind of calm.  It has that shroud of Turin look. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  I just want to know, do you got a pocket full of kryptonite?  It's 420 right now, dude.  I'm looking at my watch.  Me and you.  Cover high times.  Five times cover boys.  Right on.  How about you?  I'm working on it.  Oh, okay.  I got a song.  Check out number 18 right here on the new record, Bipolar.  The Weed Song.  Yeah.  What's it about?  Is it about gardening?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Time of song, 420.  Oh, okay.  Oh, there you go.  Gardening.  It's one of Stinky's favorites, I think. 
[01:23:30]  Stinky loves the weed.  The weed, Stinky.  Well, you know what?  That's one thing we all have.  Just make sure you sign our stairwell, please.  Yeah.  We need the celebrity signature in the pot-smoking stairwell.  Oh, Stinky.  What do you got, man?  It's Stinky.  I saw it was in your bag yesterday.  Nice job.  You bringing in a bowl?  What was that?  Nice.  I don't know the name of it.  Nice and fluffy, though.  It was fluffy.  Yeah.  Stinky is the connoisseur.  Robert may have to follow you.  Is that why they call you Stinky?  Yeah, let's hook it up.  You want to go to the stairwell? 
[01:24:00]  Did your mom name you Stinky?  Definitely.  Yeah, let's go.  Stinky stairwell, man.  Sweet.  Did anybody vote for the marijuana reform candidate?  Woo-ha.  Who?  All right, we're going to take a break.  We've got a party going on.  Yeah.  What a shame.  And the girls are next, so stay there.  Opie.  Thumb the Sweetheart.  And Anthony.  That's the A-hole over there.  You C-sucking F-tool jack off ass F.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, that's funny. 
[01:24:30]  We're back with the mess we call The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes.  Mario Cantone in the studio playing Caroline Sunday night.  Sunday night at 10 o'clock and the 25th at 10 o'clock.  We lost Mr. Spin Doctor and Vanilla Ice.  Where are the boys?  You know what it is?  It's Stinky's Smoke with the Stars segment of the show where Stinky goes to the stairwell  with various members of the entertainment field.  And just parties hardy with them.  That's not what they're out rehearsing their dance steps. 
[01:25:00]  That's exactly what was going on.  They were rehearsing their dance steps.  Josh cracking on us.  Nah, I'm saying Stinky has his segment of the show.  Yo, dude, open your eyes, man.  Smoke with the Stars.  Look at his eyes.  It's the sticky, icky bomb home.  Smoking fat sacks, puffy like Sean Combs.  Or puffy like Shelly Wintosh.  I'm back blowing that dookie out my nostril.  In the studio creating shh.  That's colossal.  All right, enough.  Man, so what do you think of Stinky's stand?  I think I've got peace in Robert's eye. 
[01:25:30]  It's good stuff, Stinky.  I'll bust rhymes for you all day.  Look at his eyes, man.  He's got peace in his eyes.  That's all that's in his eyes is peace.  Look at Stinky.  Look at Stinky.  What's up, Stinky?  Yo, Stinky.  Hi, Gigi.  What's up?  Stinky came in.  He looked just like the picture on his T-shirt that you can buy.  He looks like Colin.  You can buy it on FoundryMusic.com where he's holding the bong.  He's got the big smile.  Don't forget to bring a towel.  Tally says, don't forget to bring it.  Want to get high?  I hate Tally.  Oh, Tally's genius. 
[01:26:00]  Tally is the best.  Oh, you know.  I like Butters.  You know nothing of the theater.  Butters rock.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I had two quick questions.  Number one, I wanted to ask Vanilla Ice.  Does it piss him off when he hears white rappers today like Eminem making fun of him?  And number two, did Mario help him write the song Hard to Swallow?  Hard to what?  Swallow?  Hard to Swallow.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did, actually.  We had a meeting.  Okay?  You ass.  All right, Mario.  Back to you, Rusty.  Let Vanilla Ice answer the first one.  Yeah.  What do you think of Eminem? 
[01:26:30]  You know, there's no hate there.  It's all entertainment.  In fact, on my new record, I destroyed him, so it's great.  Oh, really?  But, you know, it's funny that people compare us because it's a whole white thing, you know.  Yeah.  Everybody that's after me, you know, is going to be living under that shadow, you know what  I'm saying?  So, it's entertainment.  Sit back and enjoy it.  It doesn't bother me at all.  How did you destroy him on your album?  I said Eminem stands for Mini Me.  Oh, God.  Eminem, you need to be grateful to me and Dre because we paved your way, fool. 
[01:27:00]  And if you're not, I'll eat you like candy and send you back to Detroit wearing panties.  But, you know, just, it's all entertainment.  I love doing it.  It's fun, dude.  I can flow all day, all night, you know.  So, it's all good.  It's all gravy, as we say.  I like a high vanilla ice, man.  All right.  Let me tell you a funny story, bro.  Yeah, go ahead.  This is all completely off the subject.  I was in West Virginia, man.  This is hilarious.  Mm-hmm.  And I'm on the...  A place Mario will never go.  I can't wait. 
[01:27:30]  I'm running to the south.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, how to get him talking again, okay?  I know.  I'm sorry.  And play Strange Fruit in the background.  I'm running to Virginia.  All right.  Go ahead.  So, I'm racing.  I race motocross.  Okay.  And used to do the jet skis, right?  Jet skis, too.  In fact, I was on the jet ski tour coming through West Virginia.  Okay.  We did this deal for Discovery Channel.  We were doing it up there.  But the thing is, is that I was walking in this hotel.  And out comes this guy.  And he's looking at me.  And I'm just like, man, this guy's looking at me all crazy. 
[01:28:00]  And he turns around, man.  And his accent just blew me away.  And he was for real.  This is for real, man.  He turns around.  He says, hey.  Hey.  Ain't that you?  I said, excuse me?  He goes, yeah, that's you.  Damn it.  Niller eyes.  Niller eyes.  I knew that's you.  And then he just walked off.  And that was it.  And I'll never forget it for the rest of my life.  Niller eyes.  All my friends now are effing with me. 
[01:28:30]  Always.  Niller ass.  Niller ass.  I'm like, dude, come on.  It's insane.  That's hilarious.  Think he had some good weed, man.  No way.  Yeah.  Think he rules.  Malik.  Are they going to come in here and arrest all of you now?  Stop talking about it.  No.  Oh, it's just for the radio.  Of course.  This is all entertainment.  You kids worry me today.  I was at a diner in, like, Arkansas when I was, like, 21 years old.  I'm in this diner.  I'm like, can I have a cheeseburger and a Coke?  And this lady's like, what? 
[01:29:00]  Can I have a cheeseburger and a Coke?  What's that you said?  I said, can I have a cheeseburger and a Coke?  Oh, a cheeseburger and a Coke?  Why didn't you say so?  You didn't understand your plain English.  Exactly.  You ought to try Wendy's drive-thru in Hialeah.  I'll take a number two.  I'm not this crazy.  Okay?  I'll take a number two.  Que no hablo ingles?  I said, I'm at Wendy's.  Where's Dave?  You know?  I had to actually see a manager to tell him, dos. 
[01:29:30]  I will take a dos with Coke.  Coke?  That's pretty universal.  I don't think there's another language for Coke.  Coke is Coke no matter where.  Coke is in Russian.  It was still called Coca-Cola.  Right.  Stinky F-ed up our guest.  Stinky rules.  Yo, O&A.  Malik, what's up?  Peace, yo.  What's up, son?  Hey.  Yo, listen.  Is vanilla ice cream still there?  Ice cream, man.  Oh, there we go.  I'm not dissing you, son.  I just wanted to holler at you, y'all.  I wanted to know whatever happened to the beef between you and Third Base. 
[01:30:00]  I thought y'all was supposed to go.  Third Base!  I thought you and Serge were supposed to go at it.  Um, you know, I'd be happy to.  I don't know what happened with them, man, you know?  Um, as friendly as that guy is, shoot, I don't know what's going on.  Because personally, I think he'll get you with the lyrics, son.  Yeah, but see, that's the whole thing is, you know, Third Base beat up our life.  All you know is what the image that you saw, you know, of me so many years ago, man.  And that's all I do is bust rhymes.  I mean, you know, these guys couldn't get, I mean, come on, where we at in New York? 
[01:30:30]  Tell them to come up here right now, on air, and I will challenge you right now.  Oh, me?  No, not you, dawg.  Oh, Third Base!  Third Base.  Oh, okay, I know you don't want it with me.  Let me tell you, MC Search, you need to search for some contacts.  You got them big bifocals.  Word, looking like a hip-hop nerd.  And that other punk makes me laugh.  Pete Nice looks like he sings for Color Me Bad.  So take a look in the mirror, and you'll be knowing how I'm flowing when I'm blowing up like a bomb.  I'm thinking. 
[01:31:00]  No, dawg, I just love it, man.  You know, it's all entertainment.  We're going to have to fire.  To be honest with you, dawg.  We're going to have to fire stinky.  I wish everybody's success that is into the music industry, no matter what.  I don't hate on anybody.  Everybody has the same dream, and the hate needs to go.  And, you know, the whole thing is that it's all entertainment.  Sit back and enjoy it.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  What was the deal?  Third Base beat up a look-alike Vanilla Ice in their video, right?  Yep.  Exactly.  Okay.  You remember that.  At the baseball bat.  It was a while ago.  Yeah.  It's a year ago.  I don't even know where those guys are now. 
[01:31:30]  I don't either.  See, all that stuff hurt, too.  That led to, you know, the depression and everything.  Seeing stuff like that, for me, you know, was horrible at the time.  Really?  I can't look back on it now and laugh at it, you know?  But when you first saw it, you're like, oh, Jesus.  Right.  I mean, it was just, you know, player-hating everything.  But I understand it all, you know what I'm saying?  I just want everybody else to understand that they would have done the same thing.  So, you know, when you paid millions of dollars, it will manipulate you.  It will influence your direction, though, man, because it looks like it would have been impossible to come out from under that. 
[01:32:00]  There is so many politics to the music industry, and I didn't realize that at the time.  Yeah.  I was just kind of this puppet, and I'm target as well.  You know, you're number one.  You're selling a million records a day, you know.  Come on.  Everybody in hip-hop should be grateful, and this is no BS, you know, to my record,  because before my record came along, man, in hip-hop, there's no doubt the most sold record was like 2, 3 million,  which was a lot. 
[01:32:30]  That was huge back then.  I sold 17 million, man, to people who never considered listening to hip-hop.  Therefore, the whole thing about anybody as far as white rappers need to be grateful to me,  every rapper should basically be grateful to the record that, you know, where we took hip-hop.  Now you're going to cross the crowd.  Check it out.  Now you're going to get some calls.  No, no, it's for real, though.  You can prove it because of the fact that you go to these concerts.  You go to a DMX concert, Busta Rhymes.  It's 50% to 80% white kids out there.  Okay, well, before my record, there wasn't none. 
[01:33:00]  I did the Stop the Violence Tour, y'all.  I did with Stetsasonic, EPMD, you know, mix a lot, and then I went with Hammer.  But, you know, dude.  There's going to be some black guys calling up.  It's hip-hop in general.  No.  You know something?  No, it's all.  There's not going to be anything.  I'm not doing anything.  Yo, yo.  Who's on the line?  Yo.  Yeah.  This is Eminem, man.  Yo.  You got something deep there, Iceman?  Yeah, sure.  I heard you like to talk some trash.  You need to work on your voice.  You need to be with you on me, pal. 
[01:33:30]  Hey, you know what?  You don't even sound like Eminem.  You don't even sound like Eminem, bro.  Squeeze your nuts a little tighter.  Squeeze your nuts a little tighter, and you might sound like Eminem.  No, this ain't the 80s anymore, baby.  It's either red Eminem or the blue.  I love to see, you know, that's the fun of talk shows, man, because you can just talk a lot of smack, and it's fun, and you get feedback.  But what he's trying to say is it's entertainment, y'all.  He was the first white rapper, and because of his sales, it opened the door to a big crossover audience. 
[01:34:00]  You know, it's like Michael McDonald was Blue-Eyed Soul.  He's Blue-Eyed Hip-Hop.  Who?  That's it.  Michael McDonald!  Don't mess with me!  I love Michael McDonald.  Mr. Weeks, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Mario, put it back in it, really.  All right, hold on, hold on.  All right, all right.  Go ahead, Mr.  How you guys doing?  Good.  Yo.  Rob.  That little thing you did on MTV when you smashed the set, that was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  Like, the looks on their faces when you went ballistic, that was so cool. 
[01:34:30]  You've been on your side, like, since day one, and I want to thank you for, you know, staying true to yourself and persevering and all that.  Thanks, brother.  Appreciate it, brother.  You got to pick up the new Bipolar CD?  I probably am.  I mean, you know, I pick up, like, I listen to a lot of different stuff, man, you know.  I'm going to check you out.  Appreciate it, brother.  You know, that stuff you did on MTV, like, when you really, really went ballistic, that was the coolest.  And I'll be the first brother to be on your side, yo.  Shut up, man.  All right, Mr.  Thanks, brother.  And you're playing the gig there, Robert?  No. 
[01:35:00]  Where is the gig?  Tonight, it's at, uh, Plymouth.  Uh, Brownies.  Brownies in, uh, Plymouth, Pennsylvania.  Tonight, and then tomorrow, Chantilly's in, uh, Conquer, New Hampshire.  Yes.  We're on in Boston, so there you go.  Come on out.  We'll do the freestyle show there.  Let me go to Pat.  From Boston.  Pat, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, you already, uh, talked about the, uh, M&M's.  I want to know, I remember seeing him on MTV years ago about the under-pressure riff.  You know, the da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  You know what I mean? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And you were saying it was completely different?  No, it was a joke, bro.  Come on.  You mean you're not?  And another thing I want to know, you keep shooting him up, about 17 million records, 17 million.  I guarantee in one month that you don't sell 7 million records.  Hey, let me just tell you something, bro.  7 million records.  O&A, bring him back.  Get over the player-hating, bro.  He won't sell.  You need to get over the player-hating, because it's silly, bro.  You know, you're a wonder-loser.  Yeah, but see, you're player-hating, bro.  I'm not player-hating.  You're player-hating to the full extent right now, because I do music, bro. 
[01:36:00]  And anybody who does music, we all have the same dream.  Don't hate on somebody who makes it through the cracks, dude.  It's like winning a lottery or something.  It's hard to get there, bro.  Just because you don't approve of something they do or whatever, you ain't got to hate on somebody.  It's ridiculous, bro.  Ridiculous.  Pathetic.  All right, there he goes.  Pat Scott.  You're going to lighten up.  You're going to ruin his buzz.  You're going to buzzkill at me.  You're going to buzz up, man.  We got him in a good state right now.  It doesn't bother me, bro. 
[01:36:30]  You know, I understand everything.  We don't want him busting up our studio.  Yeah, yeah.  Give me a bag right in here now.  Mike from Cleveland.  What's going on?  What's up, Doc?  Hey.  How you doing?  What's up?  Hey, Doc.  I want to ask Mario if we'll talk like a man for a second.  Yeah.  All right.  Just see what it'll sound like.  Okay.  I will talk with a man in one second.  Okay.  Hey, guys.  Good.  Did you hear it?  Leave him.  Leave him.  He's cursing.  Mike, come on.  Okay.  Mike, you're not representing Cleveland very well. 
[01:37:00]  No.  Oh, that's where he's from.  Of course.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  All right.  Big Kevin's back on the line.  Oh, Big Kevin's bringing us a celebrity star.  It starts from the past.  From where?  Where are you, Kevin?  I did not cook vanilla ice.  Where are you, Kevin?  We're enjoying vanilla ice.  Better than what we've done, no?  I'm at the National Comic Book Art Boy and Sci-Fi Expo Spectacular Extravaganza.  Hey, save me a seat at the table.  Geek Central.  I found out some stuff about Mario Cantona that I'll have to tell you guys later on. 
[01:37:30]  What?  Tell me now.  Might as well say more.  You can't tease like that.  You can't do that.  I found out that he has a connection to Gary.  Gary.  The 11-year-old Gary.  The 11-year-old Gary, yeah.  Gary who?  But I can't get into that right now because I have with me Kathy Garver.  Kathy Garver?  Who played Sissy on Family Affair.  You do not.  She's not there.  Yeah, she is.  I'll put her on right now. 
[01:38:00]  Hold on.  And Mario can do the entire interview.  Sissy from Family Affair.  Hi there.  Hi, Sissy.  Hi, how are you?  I hear you milked the Noah Ice.  Are you what?  I what?  Is that true?  Is that I what?  Sissy.  You melted Vanilla Ice?  I melted him?  Sissy.  You melted him?  No, I never melted him.  How am I going to melt Vanilla Ice?  He's standing here solid and tall.  He is still?  He is still.  I take Ice Star on Spider-Man and his amazing friends and I could never get close to Iceman.  This is really Sissy, you guys. 
[01:38:30]  I'm not kidding.  Of course it is.  Sissy from Family Affair.  When are you guys going to bring these chicks in, man?  Sissy?  Thank you, Vanilla Ice.  Thank you, Vanilla Ice.  No, no, no.  Who cares about Sissy?  I do.  What was Sebastian Cabot like to work with?  Oh, what a genius, Sebastian Cabot.  He was a wonderful, wonderful actor.  Now, I hear that this could be a little bit of a raunchy program, but with a name like  Buffy, you have to be kind to child stars.  I don't know what he's doing. 
[01:39:00]  Isn't that true?  Hey, hey, I want to talk about Little Buffy.  Oh, Little Buffy, yes.  The life of Little Buffy.  Did you ever tie off with Little Buffy?  I did.  I said goodbye at her 18th birthday party.  Now, that is where she died.  Yes.  Right?  And you were there?  No, a month beforehand.  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, thank you.  Well, thank you very much.  It was nice talking to you.  Thank you, Sissy.  Oh, stop it, Dice. 
[01:39:30]  That's Andrew Dice playing.  I'm sorry, Sissy.  That's Andrew Dice playing is in here right now.  Oh, you have a full heartache.  Bring the phone up, Dice.  And you're being very rude.  Shut up, Dice.  Sissy, you still there?  I am.  I heard there was no gambling, though.  You got all the dice there?  Bring the phone up, you skank.  All right.  Silence.  Okay.  Big, Kev, thank you so much.  Hey, Sissy.  Great interview.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you. 
[01:40:00]  Hey, this was no one walked away.  Come on down to the National Comic Book Convention.  Bye.  We'll Comic Con you.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Big, Big, Kev.  Yeah.  Great job, Kev.  Hey, thanks.  Great job getting a sissy from family.  I think when she said it was worth the wait, I think I detect a little sarcasm.  I think so.  Did she go away first?  Oh, yeah.  All right, Big, Kev.  We look forward to your next celebrity again for us.  The incredible new Ferrigno. 
[01:40:30]  Next?  Hopefully.  Look, in the words of vanilla ice, get the chicks in here.  Exactly.  I don't know what the hell we're waiting for.  You know what, even I'm going to say, get the chicks in here, do something.  Get the chicks in here.  All right, before we take a break, our buddy is checking in here.  Jay Moore.  Hey, I'm over there in the desert.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Jay?  We've got vanilla ice in the studio, bro.  V-O, what's up, baby?  What's up?  You know who about Jay Moore?  What's up, man? 
[01:41:00]  What's up, Jay Moore?  5-4-0 with the rag out down so my hair can't blow.  We've got vanilla ice in the studio.  I'm fucked up, man.  You don't need me.  You've got the V-Ice.  I thought I was in the airport and I went to the record store and you got your album V-Ice,  right?  Yeah, I don't.  That's it.  He's working bipolar these days.  Bipolar?  That was the album.  I don't know.  But it wasn't vanilla ice, it was V-Ice.  Yeah.  All right, so we're all agreeing with each other.  Where are you, Jay?  I'm in Las Vegas. 
[01:41:30]  Oh.  What are you doing in Vegas?  I'm doing the Paris Casino.  Nice little room of 1,200 seats.  Yeah.  We're going to have a good time.  Jay.  What's up?  What's up?  What's with this Lee Atwater movie you're doing?  I'm not doing the Lee Atwater movie.  I just told them the rights to it.  You sold them the rights to it?  I got...  No, we got the rights to it.  We're trying to put it together at HBO.  I'm a mover and a shaker, Anthony.  I know.  Well, I'm reading all kinds of things on Drudge that you're going to star as Lee Atwater. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, I heard I'm taking over Monday Night Football.  I'm taking over for Bill Maher.  I heard I do amateur porn with donkeys.  You know, come on.  Those we've seen.  Now, is that one of the rumors, too?  You're taking over politically incorrect?  Well, when I did my Disney deal for more sports on ESPN, they kept asking me about a late-night component.  Well, he's going to be out of there.  You know that.  And ESPN, it was ABC, and, you know, I can read between the whys.  And when you say no to it three times, and on the fourth counterproposal, when you're doing it, you say, 
[01:42:30]  How about the late-night component?  But I don't want to sit at a desk, you know, for 15 years going,  So, David Arquette, you got a new book out.  Fascinating.  You have sex with Courtney Cox.  Good for you, because I wouldn't.  Hey, Jay, you got a question for Vanilla Ice?  He banged Madonna, you know.  Yeah, I saw you on the cover of People Money.  Man flavor for V.I.  Bipolar.  My message is for everyone to go out.  Show a little respect. 
[01:43:00]  My man is like a phoenix, rising from the ashes.  He's got the new album out.  He's true to health, true to the game.  Go buy Bipolar, baby.  Are you playing in New York, V.I.?  Yeah, I'll be playing New York soon, man.  Been a month or so.  Where are you playing?  I'll be playing New York soon.  We're playing Philly tonight, though.  Where in Philly?  We're playing brownies, actually, outside of Philly, in Plymouth.  Nice.  Yeah, it's going to be a hot show.  You don't want to ask him about Madonna?  Did it smell like hot, sizzling in hot garbage? 
[01:43:30]  It was like flowers.  It was like flowers.  Well, yeah, that's all I wanted.  Does she like to be spanked?  Jeez, man.  Everything in between.  Did you read about all the...  Jay, hold on a second.  Did you read about all those abortions she had?  Did you read that?  Eleven abortions?  I read a lot of crap, you know.  So you don't think that's true?  Dude.  Everybody should remember everything you read.  Maybe 10% of it is real. 
[01:44:00]  10% of it is true.  I read the magazine, and it said Vanilla Ice was white.  That's 10%.  I'm Choktaw Indian.  See, they don't know.  MCs act like they don't know, right?  I don't, dawg.  Hey, I'm just calling to see...  Are you guys up and running here in Vegas?  Because I'm going through the dial, and I'm getting a headache listening to Britney Spears.  Yeah, we're on the AM over there.  Oh, that's...  Okay, what's the number?  Because I want to tune it in.  What's the number, you say?  The hell is the number?  1440. 
[01:44:30]  1140, I believe.  1140.  On your amplitude modulation.  Yeah.  Good.  Now I can say your name on stage every night, and we'll win people over 500 at a time,  1,000 at...  Whatever it takes for total world domination.  All right, cool.  Jay, we got to go...  I like the motorcycle movie, man.  That was cool.  I don't know, bro.  Have fun in Vegas, man.  Thanks, brother.  Viva Las Vegas, Jay.  Are you in a bad mood, V-I-C?  Viva.  No, bro, I'm happy, man.  Nah, he went to the stairwell.  It's stinky.  He's fine.  He has peas in his eyes.  His eyes aren't even open, Jay. 
[01:45:00]  Hang up, you filthy skanky!  All right, Jay, well, let's hear it.  All right, now that I know what...  1140.  Yeah.  All right, that's the reason I called to get the numbers, and then Rachel bumped me through,  but I'm glad I got to talk to Vanilla Ice, but that doesn't happen every day.  We also have Chris from the Spin Doctors, lead singer of the Spin Doctors.  Baby!  In the distant city!  Hey, Jay, do you do the Chris Walken imitation?  Oh, yeah.  Is that you?  He's the best.  Of course, if you're going to be in a band with Christopher Walken, we have to call it 
[01:45:30]  the Spin Doctors.  We get that boy that we like, Vanilla Ice, who's Chuck Paul in him.  It's fantastic.  Vanilla Ice, he did a motorcycle movie with a beautiful young girl, and he banged Madonna.  However, there's nothing better except the banged Madonna with the motorcycle girl.  How's that?  Is that all right?  Water.  Water.  Melon.  All right, take care of yourself.  And Chris, put on an album. 
[01:46:00]  What'd you do?  Yeah, yeah, I'm working on it.  I'm working on it.  Touche, Jay.  You rock.  God bless you guys.  All right, we'll see you soon, man.  All right.  That's our pal, Jay Moore.  You could always fly on an airplane.  He does that, man.  All right, the girls are getting impatient.  Yeah, please.  Next, right?  Right.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?  How many pairs?  Three.  We got three pairs of tickets to see the music as a weapon tour featuring Disturb, Drowning  Pool, Edema, System of a Down.  No, no, Systematic and Stereo Mud at the Hammerstein Ballroom tonight. 
[01:46:30]  Yes.  And we got, there's a few tickets available through Ticketmaster, so we'll give some tickets away  on the phone lines right now, okay?  Opie and Anthony.  I can't stop them.  We can't let these people reproduce.  Obviously, no class.  In the toilet.  They'll never work in this town again.  Disgusting.  How do they let this on the air?  We suck.  Everyone hates us.  Childish.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:47:00]  Did I just curse?  I just cursed on the air.  Did you?  I didn't have my headphones on.  I said, have someone go out and get an S-load of beer.  I think that went out.  All right, I'll start over then.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's a circus in here today.  Yeah.  We got Chris Barron, ex-lead singer of the Spin Doctors.  Yeah.  Role model.  He's been very mellow in the last hour.  Role model for the kids.  That's right.  He's got a new song out called We're All New Yorkers Now about the tragedy of September 11th. 
[01:47:30]  Five bucks on his website, right?  That's right.  ChrisBarron.com.  It all goes to the Twin Towers book.  Very good.  Every penny.  And you spell Barron with two R's.  Like rock and roll.  That's right.  The two R's are for rock and roll.  You're right.  I won't ever forget that now.  It's corny, but no one ever gets.  And we got Vanilla Ice in the studio.  Yeah.  Or do you like V-Ice better?  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  Rob.  It's just Rob.  Simple as a pimple.  But V-Ice is on the cover of the latest Bipolar CD.  Yeah.  I respond to all kinds of things, bro. 
[01:48:00]  Hey, Rob.  Rob, did you come up with Vanilla Ice or was that part of the line?  I used to breakdance back in the day, man.  That's how it started.  That was your name?  Because I'm the illest Caucasian.  My rhymes are blazing.  Across the nation.  Seventeen platinum, purely amazing.  Okay.  You guys are out of there.  Blue-eyed hip hop.  You used to do that breakdancing with the big boombox?  Oh, yeah.  Pull out the cardboard, man.  Did you really?  14 years old.  Shoot, man.  Could you do the head spin and everything? 
[01:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  That neck.  Remember, every kid was breaking their neck, doing the head spinning.  Egyptian lover.  Egyptian lover, man.  Just...  Just do it?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Of course he can.  You don't lose your talent.  You don't lose your talent, you son of a bitch.  Mario Cantone.  How can anybody lose their talent?  It's like run to bike.  That's right.  You get off it, you fall off it, you get back on.  You can't lose your talent.  And let me tell you something.  Fame makes you handsome.  I'm enjoying myself at Robert.  Yeah, I'm having fun.  Mr. Spin Doctor, I have to tell you. 
[01:49:00]  Mr. Spin Doctor.  Yes, I have.  Well, you have the respect.  You must give them the respect.  That's Dr. Spin Doctor.  Dr. Spin Doctor.  Excuse me, but I will be at Caroline's this Sunday night.  Yes.  10 o'clock and the 25th at 10 o'clock.  I must plug, plug, plug like a tampon.  Mario's having too much fun.  Let's bring in the girls.  Yes.  All right.  You know what?  I have to go eat a fortune cookie.  No, you don't.  I have to go eat some leg, move your pork, okay?  I have to go eat some leg, move your pork, and Fred Jenkins.  This is going to be a turn-on for you. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, you're going to like this.  We're going to turn your...  Well, we're going to turn this around.  We've been trying to turn...  It's going to turn it all around.  I've got to be careful how I say this.  We've been trying to turn Mario on for a while, and I think today might be the day  where...  You put it in the oven at about 350.  I think that'll be quite a turn-on for your guests at the dinner party.  All right, bring up...  With a fun more and more.  He's got quite a few characters in him, huh?  Yeah.  Bring in the sluts.  Bring in the noise.  He's bringing the sluts.  Come on.  Where are the ladies?  Here they come. 
[01:50:00]  They hit our Jager Meister machine, Anthony.  Look at them.  They're all half...  Oh, they've been nipping at the old Jager machine in the office.  One in the pink.  Look at that.  We need more microphones.  I love you girls, but...  Yeah, move over to Mr. Spin Doctor's mic.  You guys share for just a minute.  Sure.  Absolutely.  All right.  I'll share with the spin.  And, um...  Thank you for sharing.  Thank you for sharing.  There you go.  Peace be with you.  Look at that pinky one.  She's all dressed in pink.  What a lot of...  And now she's being accosted by the girl in white. 
[01:50:30]  A little Janis Joplin look there.  I like that.  I love Janis.  Well, that's why you're doing that look.  I know fashion, but...  Hey, you know, weren't any panties there, I see?  No, I'm wearing panties.  Oh, okay.  I usually don't, though.  No?  Well, why are you wearing them today?  Um, because...  Oh, hey, hey, hey.  Like, hey, all right.  That makes perfect sense.  If you really think about it, you want to stand out there with that exposed.  Sure.  I mean, the kitty shape and stuff.  Right.  That's what I could tell. 
[01:51:00]  That's what I was getting at.  Yes.  Thank you for showing me.  Nice.  Oh, you could...  Ah, look, I hope he's got the good view.  Can Anthony get some?  What?  All right, so where are you ladies from and your names and all?  What's the deal?  I'm Squirt.  I'm from Jersey.  Squirt.  Now, I know how they call girls Squirt.  I've seen movies.  Why?  It's called the female...  I'm not going to say it because it'll probably dump out of it, but when you reach the O, you  know, the big O, there's a result, resulting flood. 
[01:51:30]  It's Fountain-ness.  Fountain-ness, yeah.  Oh, but now, see?  Mario.  Everyone knew what we were talking about.  I had to clarify it.  Mario.  If you're too descriptive...  Mario, our listeners aren't dummies.  You know, you went to school.  What exactly are we talking about here, guys?  You ever see that vanilla ice?  You ever see that?  What?  The female...  The Squirt?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I couldn't see her Squirt.  Come on.  Does Madonna do that?  Squirt it on me.  No, I guess not.  Yada, yada, yada.  All right.  They're dumping out like crazy, so... 
[01:52:00]  All right.  So, you're Squirt.  I'm Squirt.  And who's the hot redhead?  I'm Ivy.  I'm from Philadelphia.  We have an Ivy in here once a week, man.  You know what?  Thank God, Philly, representing...  You're really from Philly?  This time a little better than last time.  Very nice.  I love you guys.  I miss you.  Because the last people we had from Philly...  He...  Ooh...  What's wrong, Philly?  You're knocking Philly?  No. 
[01:52:30]  We had two slobs in here a couple days ago.  Someone has to say...  Oh, see, I'm not a slob.  Not at all.  Oh, see, I'm not a slob.  No.  I shower, really.  And who else?  I have Rhonda, and I brought Pinky with me.  Pinky?  Oh, yeah.  You did, huh?  Oh, yeah.  You guys are a team?  Oh, I brought her with me.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And you keep each other happy and whatnot?  Very much so.  I keep her happy.  Did we get a picture of Pinky for the website?  No.  Okay.  We're talking about it every day. 
[01:53:00]  Right.  I understand.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  Did we get a picture of Pinky for the website?  We're talking about that Pinky.  Oh, God.  What does that look for, eh?  Jesus.  All right, and who are you?  I'm Chase, right outside Philly and Bucks County.  Nice.  We're representing the Red Raven on Route 1 in Langhorne.  Ah, the Red Raven.  Oh, there have been so many nights.  No.  Is it totally nude over there?  What's that?  Totally nude?  Red Raven?  No, down to T-string.  Down to T-string. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, okay.  That's all right.  You got to talk in the mic.  No one hears you.  There we go.  What did you say?  What?  What were you saying?  No, I wish it was completely nude.  But for that, we have to do it.  Well, you can get completely nude in Club O&A.  Club O&A has no rules.  None of those pesky, no-touching rules.  Nothing.  None of that pesky age limit.  We don't care.  I don't know what you can say.  Hold.  This is Ann who brought the toys.  Oh, you brought the sex toys?  Yeah.  They call me the fantasy lady. 
[01:54:00]  The fantasy lady?  They do, do they?  Have you guys been having fun with the toys?  No.  No?  I've been looking at them.  I've heard something about the chin thing.  Well, the chin dildo was our engineer had used that.  The engineer has that one?  Yeah.  You're talking about the accommodator, right?  The accommodator, yes.  Interesting thing.  Fantasy lady, can you get some of these girls to try this out?  There's no way.  Well, any...  As a matter of fact, it affixes to the chin.  So when you're having the oral gratification, it also hits the G-spot. 
[01:54:30]  Yes.  Bravo.  I know how to talk on radio.  But you look completely ridiculous.  Fair enough thing.  Who's looking?  Yeah.  Well, she's got a point there.  Ah.  You'd look.  Okay.  Yeah.  You might.  Well, one of the ladies, why don't you put the accommodator on?  Look at Rob.  Rob's just looking at this like...  This is like 19...  Hey, I think Iceman needs this one.  Yeah, right.  Iceman.  Yeah, right.  The Iceman come up, right? 
[01:55:00]  Oh, boy.  Nice try.  I give Gene O'Neill reference.  Ooh.  All right.  Hold on.  Ooh.  Nice try.  Actually, we brought several things for the girls to try.  Oh, okay.  Let's just watch how we describe this.  Keep it very vague.  Everyone will know what we're talking about.  You got it.  Okay.  All right.  They got the chin thing out.  It's a latex phallic symbol.  Very good.  Of the male.  How's that?  Yeah.  Genitalia.  Yeah, very good.  It has latex straps that are fixed around the head and the back of the neck. 
[01:55:30]  You don't want to put that on your head?  No one's got to put it on their head.  Yeah, put it on.  It's really made for the man, actually.  Wow.  But the man or woman.  There's not a man in this room that'll put that on.  Oh, come on.  Where's the testosterone here?  Red's putting it on there.  Come on.  Okay.  Red's putting it on.  Come on, Ivy.  Strap on.  Strap on.  Strap on.  She's putting the chin dildo.  That ding dong.  Okay.  So it fixes on the chin.  Oh, there it goes.  Okay.  Great. 
[01:56:00]  Awesome.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  That's a Kodak moment.  You know what?  Vanilla Ice and Kristen are coming back to this show.  What happens is when she is licking with oral gratification.  Words like that.  We understand what the chin dildo does.  You know what it does.  Yeah.  It's not big enough.  You know what?  We just want to see these things in action.  We really don't need the big buildup.  We don't need the big buildup.  Yeah.  Well, we want someone to put on the tool chest, too.  The tool chest, yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Someone's got to put on the tool chest.  The tool chest, yeah.  These are the two sex toys we picked out from the Fantasy Ladies collection.  Ah, great.  Mm-hmm.  Did someone sit on something?  How about the mic?  Come over there.  We can.  All right, hold on.  What happened?  She took off the chin thing.  I'll put it on.  She doesn't want to use the chin thing.  All right, you'll put on the tool chest.  You'll put it on the tool chest.  But it's on your chest.  Is it my chest?  Is that going to?  Yeah, it's got to go on your chest.  All right.  Yeah.  We can do that. 
[01:57:00]  We can do that.  All right, who's going to put on the...  No, we've got the biggest boobs.  I think we should put it on her chest.  No, it's got to go on smaller boobs, I think.  Because it's meant to go on a man's chest or something.  All right, all right.  Mm-hmm.  All right, hold on.  Mm-hmm.  Hold on.  You're boring the hell out of Vanilla Ice first of all.  So let's get naked.  Here we go.  Let's get some nakedness in the studio.  We're married anyway.  Why are you mad at Vanilla Ice?  Because he called us sluts.  No.  But it's okay because it takes one to know.  No way, sweetie.  Oh, I've been the biggest slut in the world.  I don't mind being a cold slut. 
[01:57:30]  Thank God.  Thank God for sluts.  Such a double standard.  What's wrong with that?  Oh, we can take our clothes off.  Guys love slutty girls.  Yeah, you can take your clothes off now.  Yeah.  The girl that doesn't want to be called a slut.  But, yeah, girls, just, you know, feel free to get rid of all that pesky clothing.  Mario, the action's over here.  There's nothing on that wall behind you.  Shut up.  Mario, what do you think?  I'm watching the fishing channel.  Leave me alone.  Mario, what do you think?  It's fascinating.  You like the view?  Look, she's got a tat going there.  She has a tattoo.  Mario, I like looking at the hairstyle.  Mario, just there. 
[01:58:00]  She's very sporty looking that way.  What's she got there?  Oh, there you go.  Mario, just imagine hair on that chest and you'll be all right.  Oh, yeah, all right.  Maybe I don't like hair on the chest.  How about that?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right.  Hey, two girls are making out.  One of the girls are getting the chest dildo on.  Oh, my God.  Look at that thing.  Rob, promise you'll come back.  Wouldn't anyone be worried they might die?  We're cooler than theirs, I swear.  Rob's like, geez.  All right. 
[01:58:30]  She's now fastening the straps to the tool chest.  All right.  The tool chest is completely ridiculous, Anthony.  Oh, all of them might seem a little ridiculous, the chin dildo.  Okay.  Did everybody take their ecstasy?  Oh, look at that.  We got the music going.  Whack-a-ching.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Very nice.  Yeah, there's two girls going at it.  One is receiving oral treats, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yes.  I seem to miss that.  I can't see from you.  I'm always stopping pictures for FoundryMusic.com and OpieAnthony.com. 
[01:59:00]  Very good.  What's she doing with her tongue over there?  Look at that.  You see that going on?  Mario, what do you think, man?  Yeah, I said my cataracts are kicking in.  Yeah, it's good.  Nothing?  Nothing at all?  Is it working for you?  We'll never do it.  Nothing?  We've been trying for months.  Well, maybe after they really get going.  Yeah.  All right, now she's laying down on the couch.  She's got the tool chest, is what it's called.  All right, we got a damn at the wrong.  That's pretty good.  I don't know if that was a good damn.  Oh, man.  All right.  The cops are going to come in any second. 
[01:59:30]  That's okay.  If you go to jail, it's the end of the world.  All right.  Sex, drugs, why not?  The redhead has gone downtown.  Hey, anyone want one of these?  No, thank you.  I'm good.  Okay, the one girl has the tool chest on it, Anthony.  All right, she's got the tool chest.  Have they used some kind?  Oh, yes.  Oh, she's using spit.  Prison lube, they call that. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  That's Oz lube.  Prison lube?  I didn't even know that.  Prison lube.  I'm questioning you boys now.  All right, here we go.  The one girl is, let's see.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  The tool chest.  It's working as she's being spanked by one of the other girls.  Hey, don't you have any kind of lubricant products in that bag?  There you go.  Why don't you juice up with that?  Simply silk.  It's silicone.  Pass there.  Hey, what's going?  What's going on over there, Ope? 
[02:00:30]  I really can't see.  There's four naked women on the lesbian couch.  One is working the tool chest.  Let's just put it that way.  And the redhead's in there.  And look what's playing in the background.  Some bipolar.  Yeah.  See what it does to them, huh?  Wow.  Look at what's going on there.  Well, the one girl's enjoying the tool chest.  She's leaning back as the other girl's laying down on the couch.  And she's got the tool chest on.  Now, someone's got to try.  Someone's got to try that chin product.  Really? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, how about the girl that's got the chin, the chest thing on, puts the chin thing on,  and we get the two girls going.  Bring in the fluffers.  Yeah.  Get your balls out.  Clap your balls.  Hey.  Well, you know.  They're dumping out like crazy.  All right.  All right.  They got the chin thing back.  Can she put the chin thing on, the one that's laying down?  Yeah.  She already looks ridiculous.  You might as well eat something else.  Yeah.  She'll do it.  Give it to her. 
[02:01:30]  She looks like she's willing to do anything to please a man or something.  A man or a woman.  Whatever seems to come across.  Why did Fantasy Lady choose to wear a midriff top today?  That's Fantasy Lady maybe 30 years ago.  All good.  They're putting the chin apparatus on her. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, and now another girl.  Oh, yeah.  Red's getting on there.  Nice.  All right.  Another girl has to join the party over there because the chin thing is in place.  You know, I'm going to have to crawl up on the console just so I can describe this.  Ah, there we go.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Play by play.  There we are.  That's better.  Hey, where did Red go?  Oh.  All right.  Who's going with the chin thing?  Boy, we're going to get really dumped out of today. 
[02:02:30]  Just watch the blatant descriptions.  Well, there's some hot going on, definitely.  One girl is going on.  I just see two feet sticking up over there.  Steve.  What the hell is going on?  Steve.  Put her in a sex sling, which is a harness that fits around her neck and it's holding her  legs prone.  Very nice.  Wow.  Okay.  I had to come over here to see.  Opie.  What's going on over there? 
[02:03:00]  I can't even see that far.  Anthony, what's going on over there?  She's in the sex sling, Opie.  What's the sex sling again?  Well, it kind of gets her in a position where anything can happen, let's just say.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Now she's been covered up by what seems to be another woman.  Why are they diving on top of her now, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, the sling is kind of holding her apart.  You know what I mean? 
[02:03:30]  Whoa.  Oh, she's going for the balloon nut.  Oh, yeah.  The dirty penny.  Wow.  Rob, anything?  Is this cool?  We're trying to impress you today.  Oh, come on, man.  Yeah, it's cool.  All right, good.  No, naked women are not cool.  Opie.  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Oh, it's so cool.  I can't wait to see this on E!  Later.  Toss salad action.  Hootie-hoo!  That's fantastic. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, why don't you grab one of those other toys out of there and, you know, go to town that way.  I need a mic over here.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Where's that box of toys?  It's way over here.  I'll tell you what, man.  This just apparatus looks like an electric toothbrush.  These girls are completely going at it now, Anthony. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  There's grinding.  The one girl that was insulted by being called a slut is on the bottom of the pile.  She's under three naked women right now.  But she doesn't want to be called.  I like that.  Oh, wow.  What do you got there?  There we go.  A fish tank.  All right.  Now we're going to see some.  Wow.  I can't see.  That's great.  She's, um...  Oh, baby, she's got a thing.  It looks like one of those rockets you used to fill up with water and pump up. 
[02:05:00]  And you shoot up in the air.  And, um...  It's disappearing.  I see that.  Don't you guys have some kind of goopy stuff laying around?  Well, I understand that.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Listen.  There we go.  Oh, yeah.  It's moving.  Wow.  Here you go.  Have some fun with that, too.  Oh, boy.  That thing is really shaking. 
[02:05:30]  Just give him the microphone.  I just gave him the mic.  All right.  There we go.  Wow.  Oh, now you found the Luby stuff.  That's good.  Hey, Luby.  You like that?  Redhead has two door knockers on, too, I noticed.  Whoa.  Don't choke her.  You're sticking that pretty far.  Good time.  You don't want the ladies to get hurt.  Yes.  No one gets hurt here.  And now what...  Hey, what are you doing? 
[02:06:00]  Jumping in.  She's just going to jump right in there.  Where'd she come from?  From out there?  And she's just going to jump in now.  I remember her.  She was on one of our past shows, Anthony.  She just...  All right.  She just came down.  Whoa, don't choke her.  Oh, and she got the strapped apparatus right there.  Oh, yeah.  A fifth girl joining the party. 
[02:06:30]  Wow.  You see what's going on right there, Rob?  Come around this way.  We are all...  We are taking video of this and pictures.  See it on countrymusic.com.  But look at there.  That's nice.  Way beyond that.  This is a silver bullet, and it's not Coorsphere.  I'm going to take this opportunity to tell my boyfriend I love him, and I'm sorry you're not here.  I'm doing an impression of you, of her talking to you later.  Wait.  Okay.  It's like you step back about nine feet. 
[02:07:00]  Your head, your neck goes back.  The fantasy lady's trying to get the sticker tongue down my throat.  You've got to see Steve's, like, camera view.  It's right in back all the action, if you know what I mean.  He's got the P cam.  Wait.  Let me look.  Mario, shut up.  All right.  Well, the redhead is on her back, and things are going on.  Oh, my God.  And the one on the floor in the strap has heels that are, like, nine feet high. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, boy.  Look at that.  She got completely naked over there, too.  Who is that girl, though?  I don't know.  She just wandered in, and now she's naked.  I know who she is, Anthony, from a past show.  Is that okay?  She just wants to enjoy some of the fun.  That's the girl that did some lesbian stuff and was late to her son's Little League game.  Oh, that's the Little League mom?  You're the Little League mom, right?  Little League mom. 
[02:08:00]  That's Little League mom.  Oh, boy.  Look at what we've got going on over here.  Responsible mothers.  Holy Jesus.  Little League mom and Annie.  Rob, look at what's going on over there.  Rob, you should really get up.  That's pretty good.  You've got to see that.  We're getting too close.  Look at this choo-choo train.  Hey, Anthony.  Wow.  We're going to take a break.  We've got to take a break?  Opie, I hope you're talking, because I'm speechless.  I know.  We've got to take a break.  The ladies will continue.  We've got lots of pictures being taken for FoundryMusic.com.  This is pretty cool.  Rob, you go to the stairwell.  You have some fun.  And then... 
[02:08:30]  This doesn't hurt.  Yeah.  And this doesn't bother me none.  Oh, boy.  She's doing the crap over here, you know?  Anthony, we've got to say goodbye to Rob.  Is that true?  Rob, you've got to leave?  No.  He's like, no.  They're saying you've got to leave, Rob.  Wow.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Rob might be back.  If not, he's playing brownies tonight in Plymouth.  In PA, of course.  Tomorrow, Chantilly's in Concord, New Hampshire.  All of a sudden, a hand came up and grabbed her.  She didn't know where it came from.  Kind of surprised her. 
[02:09:00]  And these girls are really going at it.  And we're getting some great footage.  Look at how she's perched over here.  We'll be back.  Hey, this is David Wells, and you're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show right here in New York City.  Hey, how you doing?  Wow.  What a scene going on here.  You know, Bud Light, Opie.  Bud Light.  When you want a light beer that tastes just like that. 
[02:09:30]  No, that tastes just like a regular Bud.  You want a Bud Light.  It's cool, refreshing, and it's a light beer.  But you never know you're drinking a light beer.  No.  Look at them going.  Jamaican Mike, what do you think?  I'm doing pretty good.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  So when you're out, maybe at a sporting event, maybe a party, whatever.  Maybe it comes to mind, a bachelor party.  And you might want to make it a Bud Light.  Don't be fooled by the imitations.  You want a light beer.  For the real taste that won't fill you up, never lets you down, make it a Bud Light. 
[02:10:00]  Opie and Anthony.  W.N.E.W.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  That's the latest from Vanilla Ice, and if anyone cares.  No offense to your music, but with everything going on in the studio, that's bipolar, Anthony.  Nothing is real.  And the moaning is not on the CD.  There is toys all over the studio, clothing all over the studio. 
[02:10:30]  I'll tell you something.  When that last commercial break was going on, I have seen things that are going on here that  few get to see.  A few people get to see, unless you're the likes of these rock stars over here, but for  guys that are just hanging out in here.  Unbelievable show, ladies. 
[02:11:00]  Sorry, baby.  Sorry, baby.  What's that about?  Her husband.  And then, yeah, Little League mom came in, and she's with the other girl there.  You know, we really should explain that.  The Little League mom came in for a lesbian session on the lesbian couch.  The lesbian couch is just beyond disgusting at this point.  I was sitting on that couch.  Yeah, I know.  Rick told me to sit on that couch.  Well, Mr. Spin Doctor.  So, the Little League mom who did a lesbian thing for us, I don't know, about six months 
[02:11:30]  ago or so, she was late for her kids' Little League game because she was too busy on the  Opie and Anthony show getting down on the lesbian couch.  She just showed up out of nowhere today, and she didn't even say hi to anyone.  She just walked in the studio and just got completely naked and jumped into the action.  And the funniest part, after about ten minutes, one of the girls turned around and went,  Who's this?  Like, points at her.  Like, who's this?  Like, they didn't even know.  She had been touching and... 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Whoa, my God.  She came from behind a secret passage behind the CDs in the lesbian couch.  Thanks.  Listen to this.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Hey, Rob, she likes your music.  Yes, Ben?  She's got the best respect, huh?  Yeah.  What do you think of this, Rob?  You like this?  What's up, Ben?  What's up?  The best is Steve with the camera.  He's, like, right at ground zero.  Oh, I know. 
[02:12:30]  About an inch away.  Oh, I know.  Hopefully we can get some of this up on foundrymusic.com or opiananthony.com.  I wouldn't doubt it.  Hey, Rob, you digging this, though, man?  I know you've seen a lot in your day, I'm sure.  You know, but it's pretty cool, huh?  It's still a pleasure to see you.  You're like, well.  I'm still a man.  Come on, now.  And, Mario, what do you think of this whole thing?  I'm fascinated.  I enjoy the lemon meringue on your breasts.  I think that's...  I like to put it in a pie myself.  I just want to tell Rob we wouldn't break this show out for MC Hammer. 
[02:13:00]  We're trying to impress you, my brother.  Right on.  I'm impressed.  Good job.  All right, there's five ladies in the corner there just completely doing you-know-wow.  It's unbelievable.  Rob, Rob, you got to go?  Yeah, I got to take off, man.  We got to do sound check for the show tonight, bro.  All right.  I'd love to hear you guys.  Where are you guys playing?  We're playing brownies tonight.  Brownies in Plymouth.  Yeah.  Yeah, Anthony.  Tomorrow, I can't say it.  Chantilly's in Conquer, New Hampshire. 
[02:13:30]  Cool.  And pick up the new CD, Bipolar, V-Ice.  Very cool, man.  Thanks for dropping by.  My pleasure.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Have a good time.  Good hanging with y'all, man.  When you're back in New York, come on by and say hi, right?  I'd love to, man.  You'll probably be disappointed because this doesn't happen a lot.  Come on, now.  You got to top it next time I come in.  That's the thing.  Yeah, I know.  That's the hard part.  This is one of the better ones we've ever had.  Look at Jamaican Mike.  Found his way up from the parking garage.  Very rarely does Jamaican Mike come up here, but you know it's a good show if Jamaican Mike is here. 
[02:14:00]  I'm just here to pick up a set of keys.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah, yeah.  You know what's funny?  They had the double apparatus, let's see, that two girls were using, and it was black.  And Jamaican Mike's like, ha, ha, why did they make it black and only half the size, man?  No, that's a good size, man.  That was a good size?  That's good for a child, not for Jamaican Mike.  Jamaican Mike jimmies the door lock to the parked cars downstairs, and they lock their keys in his car with his own junk. 
[02:14:30]  It's amazing what this guy can do.  Yeah, that's what I do for a living, guys.  That anaconda.  We should let Rob go.  He doesn't know if it should be.  Rob, take it easy.  He really has a show to do.  It's all good.  Thanks, guys, for everything, man.  All right.  I'll be listening, too.  Thanks.  All right.  It's going to mean you guys are cold.  Definitely.  There you go.  Yes, bipolar.  Pick it up.  They're no ice.  Oh, I sure will.  Do I have to get that close?  Hey, Mario, why don't you guys move over, Mike, and you'll be doing the color commentary for us,  because you're closest to the action now.  Look at Mario's got to look at this. 
[02:15:00]  I am looking at you.  Go on.  You can kiss my sweet-to-see-it-ass, because I am looking over there.  Mario, nothing.  This does nothing for you.  Bye, guys.  I've been waiting for years since I was 13.  Yeah, Rob's saying goodbye to the girls.  I saw him bent over, just looking at one of the girls.  Yeah.  Considerate.  What a call.  Nice talk.  No, I vibe.  No.  They vibrate.  Hey, they vibrate.  I keep making it.  I hate it.  I hate it.  I hate it.  I hate it.  I hate it. 
[02:15:30]  I hate it.  I hate it.  I hate it.  I hate it.  We have two E's.  And one P, because I took the other one.  I took a P.  Melissa.  What?  Oh, and Melissa.  Make it again.  Oh, what's going on?  What am I hearing?  Can I whisper something?  Go ahead.  The only one I picked up on this is Mario.  Yeah.  Fantasy lady who brought in all the sex toys is really turning me off.  She, I can see it.  I can see it.  She keeps coming over to my mic to explain a new sex toy.  She was trying, basically, to shove her tongue down my throat.  And his neck goes back about five feet. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, but look at what's happening down there.  I think they found a new toy.  Oh, a nice refreshing beer after the Little League game, huh, honey?  That's good.  Wow.  Responsible mothers.  I love them.  Well, the Little League mom, she's getting her clothes back on.  I think she's a little parched, because, boy, she...  All right, dude, I've got to say something else.  Yeah.  See, they can't hear us, because the music is cranking, and they're in the corner.  Only people with headphones can hear.  All right.  Little League mom, right?  I was right on the lesbian couch, really checking out. 
[02:16:30]  Little League mom was, let's just say, taking care of one of the ladies that came down.  Really hot scene going on up there.  Yeah.  A 19-year-old.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden...  He's a nipple clamps, man.  Okay.  It's hard to tell a story when he hears stuff like that.  So, Little League mom is on all fours.  Yeah.  And also...  Now, that's a tongue joy.  Here, take it off the...  That's a power cord.  This has batteries in it.  Shut up.  Hold on.  You old broad.  Huh?  Yeah.  All right, listen.  So, Little League mom is, you know, taking care of business orally on this one girl, and 
[02:17:00]  she's on all fours.  Yeah.  So, another girl, like, decides to go behind Little League mom and get right down to ground  zero.  And all of a sudden, Little League mom turns around really fast and goes, no, no, no, no,  no, no.  It's my time for the phone.  Boom.  God, that always happens on this show.  And the girl goes, all right, cool, cool, cool.  And then they figure something else out to do.  Good.  That's great.  What a great scene.  Whoa, don't chip a tooth, ladies.  What?  Did she chip a tooth? 
[02:17:30]  And I'm back here where I can't see her.  Why is she flossing?  What's that in your mouth?  It's this tongue.  Oh, it's like a vibrating...  Oh, it's a tongue vibrator.  It looks pretty cool.  It vibrates your tongue?  Yeah.  All right, here, fancy lady.  All right.  Here we go.  It's a very minute, high-powered bite.  Your boob is in my arm.  Oh, darling.  So, it goes around your tongue.  It has a little, like, elastic ring if you don't have a pierced tongue. 
[02:18:00]  Right.  And it goes around the tongue and it vibrates.  Yeah.  It's very calm.  It's wonderful.  I think it's time to hear Liza Minnelli sing New York, New York.  You know what I think it sounds...  You know what I think it sounds...  It's changing Liza's in New York, New York, at the White House.  It sounded like when you take the tires off of the...  You take the lug bolts out of the tires at the garage.  Boom!  Boom!  The gun.  Oh, wait.  What do we got there? 
[02:18:30]  That's it.  Okay, listen.  That's it.  Wow.  This is a ridiculous scene.  Clean up this mess!  You got to see the girl with the tongue thing.  All right.  I got to go on.  It's really silly.  Now I got to go on.  Now there's silly things going on here.  All right.  Let me...  All right.  I got a silver bullet over there.  You got the nippy vibrate thing and then the tongue thing.  That's hysterical.  Let me see the tongue thing work.  The tongue thing.  Let me see the tongue thing in action.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  It's hysterical.  It looks like he has a... 
[02:19:00]  Is that how they get the holes in Swiss cheese?  She is completely taking care of that girl.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, what are you giving her there?  What's in the little silver pouch?  It looks like a Pop-Tart.  What is it?  It's a Pop-Tart.  Oh, here comes Fantasy Lady again.  It's a Pop-Tart.  It's a sizzling body candy.  Oh, boy.  You put it in your mouth and it sizzles like fizzy.  Is it Pop-Rox?  There you go.  Well, I guess.  All right.  Hey, Antony's headphone's over there. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  You can't hear everybody.  I'll get hooked up in a second.  All right.  Using the Pop-Rox.  Okay.  What?  For this?  Oh, yeah.  That's action going on down there.  Oh, what I just saw, Elby.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  You know, these...  Oh, I got them.  These girls...  All right.  These girls have put us over the...  Next.  Hold on.  You've got to watch the language.  Elby, I am hooked up now with headphones.  I'm getting itchy.  Over here.  Could...  Could someone keep Fantasy Lady away from me, please? 
[02:20:00]  There's Liza.  She seems to like you.  Thank you, man.  She seems to like you.  Fantasy Lady's got a little crush on me.  She tried to grab his ass.  You know what?  This is like Christmas.  She keeps going to the box.  She opens up another thing and then brings it over, and then they play with it, and then  you go and open up some more presents.  You've got to talk to Little League Mom real fast.  We haven't heard from her in a while.  Oh, but I don't want to interrupt her.  She's pouring Pop Rocks on other girls and then eating them.  Oh, all right.  Wow.  Look at that.  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Little League Mom's taking her clothes off again.  She just put all her clothes back on.  She was taking a break, and now she has to get back in the ballgame.  Dude.  Mario at Caroline Sunday.  Thanks.  10 o'clock.  I am getting an up-close look at the two girls over at this part.  I mean, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's a silver bullet.  Wow.  Wow.  I've got to say, that's the first time I've seen that live. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Holy.  Let's just remember, these girls don't want to be called sluts.  What happened?  Whoa.  What?  Mario.  I don't want to know, right?  Dude, dude, yeah.  You didn't see that?  I missed it.  I hope you got that.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Hold on.  Wow.  What's up?  Oh, my God.  Everyone's in a standing ovation.  That was a standing ovation. 
[02:21:30]  Same thing?  Oh, look.  They're challenging each other now.  Hey, she could do the same thing.  Hey, look at that.  All right.  Let's see if you could get that going.  All right.  Hey, hey, no one's bothering you.  Come on.  Do it.  She's using that thing.  All right.  You can do it.  Go ahead.  You can lose your talent.  Let's see if she could do it.  Clear the field.  Let's not talk, ladies.  All right. 
[02:22:00]  Don't describe anything that's on.  All right.  Let her do what she wants to do.  Well.  Everyone quiet.  That was a good aerobics class.  All right.  She's smearing something on that device.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Let's see if she could do it.  Sweet.  I need a microphone.  All right.  I want to see if she could do it.  Over there.  Oh, there we go.  Here we go.  Wow.  This is too much.  No, I can't say a word. 
[02:22:30]  I'm being very...  Everyone be quiet.  Steve might be in the line of fire.  All right, wait.  I'm wondering if Steve's in the line of fire.  I've never done a radio show from this position before.  Rachel's very close.  She's a lady to keep her hands off my butt.  Rachel's real close taking pictures.  She might be in the line of fire here.  I'm waiting.  Okay.  She looks like she's getting worked up.  I don't know what...  Hold on.  Hold on.  No one say anything.  All right.  Don't say it.  She thinks she can do it, too. 
[02:23:00]  I love how the girls challenge each other.  I like that.  That's a good challenge, though.  Oh, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  She seems to like it.  I'll put the mic near her.  You might want to put that on five or six instead of four.  Don't ruin it.  Oh, fancy.  Let her work.  Just let her work.  Put it on 12 so it'll fly them all out of here.  Marion, come on over here.  I'm just kidding.  I can see.  I can see. 
[02:23:30]  Actually, you know, it's really sweet.  Come over here.  We're bonding.  I'm bonding.  I am.  Why are we putting down newspaper?  I want this rug steamed and fumigated.  Clean up this bus.  Mr. Spin Doctor, are you having a good time?  Anthony Shatton.  What happened?  The guy from Wild Kingdom.  What did we miss?  Did it happen?  Yeah, you know what it is?  Everybody is making too much of a racket.  She can't concentrate.  You can't concentrate?  She can't concentrate. 
[02:24:00]  You like that?  What a surprise, a bum that can't concentrate.  Wow, that was something.  I've got to say, that was pretty amazing.  I'll be opening it up for a Mary at Caroline's.  Yeah, Sunday night.  Please come to see me at Caroline's Sunday night.  And the 25th, 10 o'clock shows.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100 for reservations.  Is she going to get electrocuted?  Oh, welcome to the Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.  Wow.  Do we have to take another break?  I'm Marlon Perkins.  I've got to say, Opie, first of all, I had never seen that girl. 
[02:24:30]  Her name is, what, Squirt?  Squirt, yeah.  I had never seen that actually happen.  It was amazing.  I saw the whole thing.  But was it...  It flew.  Is it...  No, it's a byproduct of a good feeling.  Wow.  And not the byproduct of having too many beers.  Okay.  And it was amazing to watch. 
[02:25:00]  All right, Anthony...  It looked like...  You ever see...  You ever see the lions on the plains of the Serengeti when they back up to a tree?  And tell all the other lions that this is their tree?  That's pretty much what I was seeing.  I want to know why Mario's way over there still.  It's mad, Mario.  I'm right here.  I'm watching everything.  Oh, Mario, come over here and soak in the scent of a woman.  Yeah, soak in my ass.  No, no, you got to... 
[02:25:30]  I am not soaking in anything.  Except a tub when I get home.  Ben, is fantasy lady checking out my butt?  Fantasy lady watching...  Hold on.  She keeps grabbing your ass, dude.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, wait.  Oh, round two.  Yeah, there's something else going.  These are...  Okay.  Oh, a stress bus.  Okay, these are good.  I like those.  Hey, gay guy, shut up.  Oh, nice.  Keep it up.  I didn't say that.  Oh, yes, you did.  No, it was your other personality, Celesta. 
[02:26:00]  Celesta.  I need sugar.  Well, we don't know what she's doing.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  She just grabbed Rachel's leg. 
[02:26:30]  Like, she's like, oh, God, oh, God.  And just laid her nails into Rachel's leg.  Rachel's like, you just grabbed me.  No way.  We better take a break.  Yeah.  You know, I want you boys to be on the air for a long time.  Yeah.  This is not good.  That's what I'm out of here.  This is great.  Where's Marlon Perkins?  I'll stay here behind the blind while Jim goes in and looks at the girls.  Ben, we'll take a break and we'll play What Do We Learn on the ONA Show next.  Opie and Anthony.  I can't take it anymore. 
[02:27:00]  We are back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  What a day.  Mario is really, really freaking out.  I'm not freaking out, but you want to know something?  What?  You're talking about smoking in the stairwell.  You've got lesbian sex all over the place.  This is the closest I've ever been to a porno film.  Where's Rocco some Freddy when you need him?  And I'm going to tell you something right now.  Yeah.  I want you boys to be on the air for a long time, and you will get thrown home.  The cops will be in here frisking all of us, and I'm the only one that will enjoy it. 
[02:27:30]  I want you boys to cut it out.  Okay.  He's really freaked.  Tell Mario to shut up during the lesbian sex.  No.  You shut up during the lesbian sex.  He was sitting there, not even looking.  His head was turned at the wall.  I...  Hey!  Let me tell you something.  Hey, hold on, hold on.  What?  We're responsible broadcast, but you can't say that.  You're about as responsible as Little League Mom.  Little League Mom's responsible? 
[02:28:00]  I'm sure she takes care of her kid.  I want Little League Mom to be a responsible mother.  I want her to promise you that right now.  Shut up!  That was me telling...  Shut up!  That was me telling me to shut up.  That was fascinating.  Yeah, I got Mario's back.  Shut up!  Okay, I know you owe me one right now.  I want to hear Liza Minnelli sing New York, New York, at the White House.  Play it!  Oh, my God.  Dad, you're bald.  All right, for you, Mario.  For you.  Top your ass up!  For you.  We'll bring the gayness back.  Yeah, really.  Bring the gayness back. 
[02:28:30]  Here we go.  Here it is.  If I can make it then, I'd make it anywhere.  Shut up!  Come on.  Come on.  Hey.  What?  What was that last part?  Shut up!  Yeah.  You do.  No.  No.  Yeah.  Shut up! 
[02:29:00]  What are you, gay?  Okay, did you see the look on Bush's face when she was singing?  Yeah.  Bush's face was like, I need to be signing things and leading this war.  I should not be here.  Having to listen to this.  And she was like...  All right, listen.  We only have three minutes left.  I know.  A cowbell bill has a very important thing to plug in.  Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, what's up, Bill?  What's up, Bill?  Quickly, what event is going on? 
[02:29:30]  Okay, well, first of all, are we playing what have we learned?  I mean, we've got to make it real fast, Bill.  We only have like two minutes left.  Give me a plug, Bill.  All right, listen, guys.  I'm down at Rockefellers.  It's on Lockfield Road and Pulaski Road in East Northwood.  We're having a benefit for the Little Shelter.  Yeah.  Sunday, starting at 2 o'clock.  All right, you can call Little Shelter at 631-368-8770.  Everybody's making contributions elsewhere.  They've kind of been left in the dust.  All right.  They've got a lot of little dogs and cats here that need help.

I'm going to be at Caroline's this Sunday at 10 o'clock and November 25th at 10 o'clock.  And, you know, on Monday nights, not every Monday night, but there's a thing called  the Stage Door Canteen that is down.  It's only for the rescue workers.  We've been down there, like, performing for the rescue workers at Ground Zero, and it's been pretty  amazing.  So, shut up!  Oh, that's nice to say after that.  You have no respect at all!

I love my boyfriend.  Guess what we all do?  We all loved your boyfriend at once. 
[02:32:30]  What?  Dump that out.  That ain't going to make it.  All right.  Yeah, we had a dump out.  All right.  And I took the headphones off, Fantasy Lady.  Yeah.  You guys have a good time, right?  You had a good time?  Ladies, thank you so much.  Thank you, girl.  You've done a fine job.  I'm drained.  A what?  Did you have a good time?  We had an unbelievable time.  I hope the listeners had a good time.  I'll distract them.  Okay.  Yeah, you girls did a good job.  So I was looking, I was checking out the action, and my, uh, no, Ann, I got to tell you, you 
[02:33:00]  come here in a bunch.  Why don't we send the ladies out of the studio really fast?  Goodbye, girls.  Girls, thank you so much.  This made Ben laugh really hard.  I was way up on the console, right?  Yeah, I know.  Checking out the action, and freaking Fantasy Lady would not leave me or my butt alone, right?  She's fondling you.  Yes, I do.  She was actually fondling, yes.  You should file a sexual harassment suit.  Oh, she's got to hold.  She's got to be 50-some. 
[02:33:30]  So I'm leaning way over, and she's now.  Oh.  Yeah.  Swear to God.  That's what that baloney smell was.  You smelled it?  I didn't know what else to do, man.  No, that would take a lot to cover up.  I swear to God.  The other fragrances was like a skunk.  I had to protect my territory.  Yeah, we've got to get out of here, actually.  All right, we have to go.  So thank you to everyone.  Guys, thanks so much for coming down, man.  Anytime.  I'm having, I'm drained.  Oh, cool.
