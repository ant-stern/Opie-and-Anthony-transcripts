<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with Opie describing his flooded basement apartment and a mysterious, creepy door leading to an unknown space.  This segued into a graphic discussion of the disturbing film "Bad Boy Bubby," detailing its sexually explicit and violent content, including a dysfunctional mother-son relationship and animal cruelty.  Paul Miller, a caller from Australia who sent the hosts the movie, joined to discuss its popularity in his country and add further details about the film's shocking scenes.  The hosts also touched upon an upcoming Halloween party, and the fallout from a listener, Paul, publicizing an unofficial guest list, angering show staffer Steve.  News coverage of Northeast flooding was mocked for its perceived over-the-top drama.  Brief mentions were made of Stalker Patty's appearance on *Maury Povich*,  upcoming campaign ads for a fictional Bill Burr versus Jimmy Norton feud for a "Third Mike" position on the show, and G-Rock Radio's unusual breast cancer awareness campaign featuring a couple broadcasting from bed in a tent.  A prank pulled by WCKG radio staffers in Chicago and an update on the availability of "golden tickets" were also discussed. The overall tone was irreverent and laced with profanity and sexually explicit language.

The broadcast continued with Opie showcasing Photoshopped images of himself as a child, one depicting him as Black and another as a lesbian.  This transitioned into a discussion about babies born with glasses, their prescriptions, and the early determination of eyesight.  The hosts then discussed a new Honda deal featuring XM satellite radio, expressing concerns that XM Canada's selection of only 80 out of 100 channels might exclude their show due to broadcasting restrictions. This sparked a wider conversation about video iPods, video on demand, the potential for XM to incorporate video, and the future of downloading television shows and integrating media services into mobile phones.

A significant portion focused on the hosts' negative experiences with AFTRA, criticizing its perceived lack of support and high dues, with Opie detailing a frustrating experience with his podiatrist and AFTRA's inadequate insurance coverage.  Anecdotes about an expensive 80-inch plasma TV and a large Sony picture tube TV, along with the difficulties of transporting them, were shared, leading to further discussion of high-definition television and viewing experiences.  A caller, Chris, noted a drug company advertisement mimicking the show's "Wow" catchphrase.  The hosts also discussed Jimmy Norton's appearance on Jay Leno, comparing Leno's style to David Letterman's, and made jokes about President Bush, Dick Cheney, the Clintons, the Supreme Court, JetBlue, and a sex party involving Minnesota Vikings players.  Stalker Patty and Pat from Menachie (a competitive eater) were mentioned, with Pat calling in to discuss his competitive eating rankings, recent grilled cheese contest, and upcoming hot wing competition.  The segment concluded with further discussion of their upcoming live appearance at the Jacob Javits Convention Center and their Halloween party, alongside a humorous exchange where Jimmy Norton struggled to read comic strips while suppressing laughter.

The show then revisited the comedic value of comic strips, particularly *Blondie*, with Jimmy again struggling to read a panel without laughing.  This led to a call-in segment with Alabama listeners defending their state's intelligence against the hosts' stereotypes.  Discussions of the "Wow" and "F.U." listener lines followed, with a caller recounting a penis-flashing incident on I-95.  More discussion of Stalker Patty's *Maury Povich* makeover ensued, along with technical difficulties with their instant feedback system and a humorous threat of violence from Anthony.  A caller imitating "Chuck from Jersey" prompted clarification regarding Jim Norton's comedic bit.  Further discussion of the "Wow" (breasts, not penises) and "F.U." lines continued, with multiple callers leaving messages.  A mock news report impersonation of Dice covering an earthquake was also included.  The hosts again discussed *Bad Boy Bubby* and their plans to watch it. A listener's call praising Jim Norton segued into a discussion about the fictional "Jim Norton vs. Bill Burr" campaign for a "Third Mike" position, involving humorous and exaggerated campaign ads. The show then transitioned to plans for a broadcasting move to Deerfield Beach, Florida, in January,  including discussions about accommodations and local entertainment, and culminating in calls debating the merits of Deerfield Beach.  The segment ended with Opie anticipating a bowel movement and his intention to call the hotline to document the event.


A subsequent segment prominently featured a live, on-air bathroom break by Jimmy Norton, with detailed descriptions and sounds of his bowel movements.  The hosts and other on-air personalities reacted and commented throughout.  This was followed by a discussion of Scientology's "silent childbirth" practice, including audio clips and debate.  Stalker Patty's *Maury Povich* makeover was again discussed, showing pre- and post-makeover appearances and details of her experience, including a listener's offer to perform a sexual act on her.  The hosts briefly touched upon the bird flu pandemic, playing a clip of George W. Bush's comments and offering commentary.  Andy Milonakis appeared as a guest, discussing his MTV show, its low-budget, absurdist nature, pranks on the elderly, interactions with inanimate objects, and his role in the movie *Waiting*.  He discussed his age and the misdirection in his show, as well as the poor critical reception of *Waiting*. Milonakis also talked about his early online videos and viewer reactions.  The interview included several off-color jokes, vulgar descriptions, casual use of the word "retard," and discussion of *Bad Boy Bubby*.  Sam, an intern, also called in to discuss his experiences working for a Syracuse radio host known as Scorch, who leads a "Naked Militia."  The interview with Andy Milonakis ended the show.

[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Where's the quality?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And he's stinky.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is the show is a disaster.  The show is a disaster.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes, stays, lays, or prays. 
[00:04:30]  I mean, whatever happens, I mean, whatever happens, your toes are still tapping.  Where'd you get that, out of the hamper?  Is that your little brother?  Sure.  He's a good-looking kid.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  Isn't this great? 
[00:05:00]  Hi.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, guys.  This is the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, bud, what's your problem?  Hey, bud.  Oh, my God.  Just a rainy mess in New York City.  It's not going away.  No.  Not anytime soon.  They're saying maybe for another five days? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Rain for another five days here in New York.  Possibly.  I don't know.  That's good because I didn't want them to start with the drought stories.  For some reason, if it's dry for any length of time, we're in danger of a drought and it's  going to be horrible.  We're going to run out of water.  They put restrictions on.  And then every year, it just rains anyway.  And it takes care of itself.  And, yeah.  Well, the reservoirs, we were getting a little worried.  Oh, yeah.  They were just going to dry up.  Now the new problem is flooding.  Now we've got flooding all over.  And I like how they try to make it sound as bad as New Orleans. 
[00:06:00]  Like, well, there's a fire department somewhere in Jersey.  Like, they're going to start evacuating people because there is a dam in this area.  And they're not sure if that's going to hold.  That could flood the area.  And everybody, of course, gets that whole flashback like, oh, no, a levy.  A levy break.  It's going to be flooded.  It's going to be flooded.  I just shrunk three feet.  I saw that.  You were trying to make a really good point.  And all of a sudden, you sunk down your chair about a half a foot. 
[00:06:30]  I sunk.  My ankle hits the lever on this chair that makes it go down.  And I'll just be talking.  And all of a sudden, I'm like eight years old.  I don't even remember what you were saying.  The dam will be fine.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  It's the news and their stupid fear that we're really starting to get very, very sick of.  They're not going to have to helicopter you off your roof.  I wouldn't worry about it.  I know the rain's getting bad out there because my bedroom is starting to sweat. 
[00:07:00]  What?  It's starting to sweat.  Your bedroom?  Yeah.  When it rains too much, it just starts sweating.  For a while, I thought it was like the water was coming in through the walls and stuff.  Yeah?  Because I sleep in what used to be a basement.  A really nice finished basement.  You moved down to the basement?  Yeah.  You haven't been over in a while.  Dude, how could you be in the basement?  Why?  Creepy fucking scary room is right there. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, I know.  Oh, the door to hell is right there.  The door to hell.  I showed Anthony once.  It's like, I sleep in the basement.  You've got to admit, though, it's a really nice finished basement.  The whole apartment's very nice if it wasn't for the, you know, sweating walls.  If it wasn't for the squirrels and the mice and the cockroaches.  The landlord that doesn't give a fuck.  Black people showering outside the old bedroom where they have to stick their head between, like, the concrete and the nozzle, which is only, like, eight inches or so, going through the garbage. 
[00:08:00]  But besides that, it's a great place.  Yeah, sounds it.  But, yeah, I showed Anthony once.  It's a beautiful finished basement.  And I sleep down there because it's a lot quieter, a lot darker.  I sleep much better down there.  But there is this door.  The door.  The door.  And on my side of the door, it looks really nice.  Of course.  But you open up the door and...  Creepy basement. 
[00:08:30]  Creepy basement.  It's all unfinished.  Completely unfinished.  Like the walls are like bedrock, carved into bedrock from the city.  I don't know what it is.  It's really creepy.  And there's stuff down there that hasn't been looked at in, I would say, 25 years.  Like people that used to live in the building maybe back in the late 70s, early 80s.  And their stuff is just still there, just rotting away.  No one's ever going to take it out of there.  It's like an old coffee can full of rusty nails. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Anything some villain could hurt you with.  But the first time I showed Anthony the place, I'm like, and, you know, here's the downstairs.  And then behind that door is creepy basement, I call it.  Creepy basement.  So I open the door and it's perfect, right?  I don't know how you sleep down there.  It's perfect.  No clawing on that door as you're trying to sleep?  You hear any sounds from creepy basement?  No, they're crawling.  I told you.  They're crawling between the ceiling.  I don't mean that.  I don't mean the squirrels or mice.  It just means something that might be settling or falls in there and you kind of hear a noise 
[00:09:30]  from in creepy basement.  Oh, man.  I would just lose my mind.  You're right.  But my floor is starting to sweat, so I know it's raining.  The floor?  It's starting to rain too much here in New York City.  Yeah.  That's my barometer.  I don't know how that would happen.  It just sweats.  It's the water table.  You know Manhattan doesn't have much of a water table, right?  Right.  It's very, very shallow.  It's close to sea level.  Very, very shallow.  So, you know, the water starts to rise, I guess, and it starts making my floor leak downstairs.  That's a little odd. 
[00:10:00]  It only happens like once, maybe twice a year.  I'd hit the high ground.  I'd have stayed upstairs.  Nah, it's too loud out there.  I got to move in general, but whatever.  Bad Boy Bubby!  Oh, boy.  Who the fuck sent us Bad Boy Bubby?  We watched about...  Well, can I...  I got to back up, though.  Last...  Yesterday was a rainy day, so it was kind of a boring day, so I was trying to find things to do.  I went and saw The History of Violence, which is a great movie. 
[00:10:30]  Really, really enjoyed that.  Yeah.  Um, then I went home and I watched the, uh, Audio Slave in Cuba DVD.  Enjoyed that.  Mm-hmm.  And then, uh, still looking for something to watch, and there was nothing on TV.  And I remember in my book bag that we all got a copy of Bad Boy Bubby.  Bad Boy Bubby.  Bad Boy Bubby.  Um, so I popped it in, and I'm, uh, sitting on the couch with Lindsey.  I'm like, hey, let's check out Bad Boy Bubby. 
[00:11:00]  How bad could it be if it says right on the front of the DVD, an amazing journey, a rare film, as funny as it is, poignant and bizarre?  It's, uh...  And that's Kevin Thomas from, uh, the Los Angeles Times.  Yeah.  A real movie review right on the front of the DVD.  It's like, it's an indie movie from England?  Uh, I don't know.  It won all kinds of those indie film awards.  You know, they got like, uh, 20,000 different awards for indie films now.  Right.  And it won a whole bunch of them.  Well, they show all the, uh, the awards, uh, these films win on the front of the DVD now. 
[00:11:30]  Winner, Grand Special Jury Prize, Venice Film Festival.  What?  Uh, International Critics Prize.  What's the jury prize?  What does that mean?  I don't know.  They just make up fucking awards.  They make up indie awards.  And then winner, four AFI awards, including Best Director and Best Actor.  He's been in his room for 35 years.  It's time to let him out.  Bad Boy Bubby.  Bad Boy Bubby.  And then on the back, it says, uh, twisted and hilarious.  Imagine being there directed, imagine being there directed by David Lynch. 
[00:12:00]  Don't pass this up.  That's from Shock Cinema.  It's got a great look to it.  Great indie look.  And, um, from the limited viewing I had of the beginning this morning,  I have got to see the rest of this.  So, it's really sick.  So, I'm watching it.  And then, did you actually say something like,  I don't know why it hasn't really taken off,  or it's not in the theaters in America? 
[00:12:30]  Well, I didn't say that.  After the first ten minutes, we were laughing like,  this is why it's not in theaters.  I didn't say that.  Like, some listener gave us all a copy of this for our first year on XM for some reason.  Uh-huh.  This is pretty much the only gift we got was Bad Boy Bubby.  Yeah.  And, uh, you want me to read the synopsis?  It says,  As LA Weekly called it disturbing and compelling,  and it was awarded the Grand Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival.  Despite a limited release in America, 
[00:13:00]  it would shock and delight audiences to become one of the most daring  and controversial cult films of the past decade.  Nicholas Hope, in what Variety hails as an astonishing performance,  stars as Bubby,  a demented man-child,  kept locked his entire life in a squalid apartment by his depraved mother.  And, man, is she depraved.  Yes, she is.  Uh, but when Bubby,  Bad old broad.  who can only communicate by mimicking what others say and do,  escapes into the outside,  he soon discovers the wonders of sex, crime, rock and roll, and pizza. 
[00:13:30]  Will this mad bastard be destroyed by the realities of our cruel world,  or does a higher calling ultimately await him in the most unlikely place of all?  Mm-hmm.  Sounds like a great movie, right?  Yep.  So I pop it in last night.  Lindsay's sitting next to me on the couch.  And, uh, about, uh, I would have to say, uh, ten minutes in,  it was, uh, so uncomfortable to her that she's begging me to turn it off.  And I was, I'll be honest, I was kind of bummed.  I was like...  Were ya?  I was like, this looks way too interesting. 
[00:14:00]  We gotta keep watching this.  Yeah.  And, um, and I sort of lost, I guess.  Really?  It got to the point where you had to turn it off?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So then I came running in here this morning at, uh, six o'clock,  and I go, Ant, you got your copy of Bad Boy Bubby still?  Yes, I do.  Because a lot of this shit we get, it just piles up on our desks and stuff,  and we never really get to.  Every six months we throw it away or give it away or something.  So now you know this thing is gold, right?  That is going home with me today because I must see the rest of Bad Boy Bubby. 
[00:14:30]  Bad Boy Bubby.  So I go, Ant, you got your copy?  He goes, yeah.  So he found it on his desk and we popped it in.  We're like, Danny, who cares what you're doing for the show?  We gotta watch Bad Boy Bubby on your computer.  Watched a good 20 minutes of it, I guess.  Was it about 20 minutes?  The beginning's about 20 minutes.  I've gotta see the rest of it.  It is probably the sickest beginning of a movie.  When the title screen comes on, you're disgusted.  Why?  When Bad Boy Bubby comes on because of what's playing behind it.  Right.  It's Bubby getting his bath.  Well, yeah.  He's how old is he, Bubby? 
[00:15:00]  He's a man-child, basically.  He's like in his 30s?  Easily.  Yeah.  He might be pushing 40.  Might be pushing 40.  And the movie starts with this apartment that has just nothing in it.  It's like a one-room apartment with a really old table to eat on.  Nothing really on the wall except a headless Jesus on the cross and a stove for cooking.  Oh, it's a hovel.  It's just like...  The walls are all gray.  It's just...  Concrete, yeah.  They're in a basement.  Very, very poor apartment. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  With a gas mask next to the door.  Yeah, gas mask hanging on the door.  And she makes him like...  What'd she make him for breakfast?  She broke up some stale bread in a bowl, put some sugar on it, and some hot milk.  And he dug in like it was filet mignon, this guy.  Bubby.  Well, that's the mom that's just twisted.  Yeah, she's got like this long, graying hair.  She's big and fat.  Got these big, sloppy, saggy tits. 
[00:16:00]  She's in her...  That you can see through her house dress.  In her 50s, I guess.  I don't know.  Probably...  Maybe 60s.  Probably older.  Yeah, probably late 50s, early 60s, kind of.  You could tell she had him when she was young, probably.  Right.  And her whole job is to take care of this man-child.  But she doesn't take care of him.  Our job is to keep him sheltered from the outside world, I guess, is what I got from the first  20 minutes.  Yeah, because she's twisted in her own right.  She's sick.  Yeah, every time she goes out of the apartment, she puts on the gas mask and, you know, warns 
[00:16:30]  him, don't move, and puts on this gas mask to scare him.  That he can't leave.  So he doesn't go outside.  Like, he can't leave without the gas mask.  Right.  So he can't go exploring on his own because he believes that if he leaves without the  gas mask, he's going to die.  So he just sits in his chair.  She goes, don't move, and just has to sit in this wooden chair at the table.  And it gets dark out, you know, and he's just been sitting there the whole time,  shitting and pissing himself.  And then his mom gets home and beats him for shitting and pissing himself, and he's all 
[00:17:00]  ready to cry.  And the next scene is her washing him.  He's standing there naked, and she's just washing his balls and his ass.  Yeah, she washes him, and then she washes herself in front of him.  She's got these big old lady sloppy tits, and she's just sponging them off, and he's  staring at her.  And then the scene cuts, and he's laying on his back in bed, and she's straddling him  going, you're such a good boy.  I'm just fucking him.  Bad boy puppy. 
[00:17:30]  Bad boy puppy.  I love this movie.  That's when Lindsay turned to me and said, come on.  I'm like, what?  This is good stuff.  This is great stuff.  Cockroaches and cats, and it's the best.  Well, you jumped ahead a little bit.  This was only the first 10 minutes of the movie, 15 minutes of the movie.  Dude, she was washing his cock when the opening credits come on.  Sounds like they should have called this Lucky Boy Bubby.  Lucky Boy Bubby.  Bad boy Bubby. 
[00:18:00]  Bad boy Bubby.  And then while she's cooking, he plays with the cat.  The cat's shit was very disturbing.  Oh, they're saying, rest in peace, Claire Benito.  Is that who the mother was?  Is she dead?  Yeah, this movie, I just...  You're kidding!  I see it on the DVD.  I guess they just figured out how to release this in America, because this looks like brand  new packaging, doesn't it?  Yeah.  But it looks like the movie first came out in 1993.  Are you shitting me?  Yeah, look.  That's how old the movie is? 
[00:18:30]  Is that right, Eric?  How did this...  How did this stay under the radar for that long?  Because I guess this is becoming a cult film, and someone decided, well, we've got to really  release this in the States.  Just imagine, like, out of nowhere, a B.A.B. show you did all of a sudden becomes the  hugest thing.  Jesus.  Like, that would be what it is, something you did and then probably forgot about.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, it takes off.  Dead Boy Bubby.  95, 90? 
[00:19:00]  Okay.  When the indie thing was all the rage, too.  That's like right around the time of, what, like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs and that  whole area of time when indie films are huge.  But let's...  Yes, Jim?  I'm just enjoying the whole vibe.  You really want to see this, right?  Absolutely.  Lucky boy.  Yeah.  Gets the logs wiped off him, and mom hops on.  What do you want?  You know what?  We could...  Here, throw this movie in there so we could at least have it playing in the background.  All right?  It's Bad Boy Bubby.  And, yeah, so the movie starts with her just washing his dick, basically. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, washing him.  He's just standing there, just standing there, like, motionless as she's scrubbing away.  This big, stupid man-child hog just, like, flopping around.  And then she has to, like, she's washing underneath her awful, awful boobs with a washcloth.  And then while she's cooking, this is all in the first ten minutes.  Yeah.  He decides to play with the cat.  Yeah.  And he's fucked up this cat so much that the cat hates him.  Well, the cat's kept in this little pit with this grate over the top, and he just pokes it with a stick, and it hisses at him, and he hisses back at him. 
[00:20:00]  This cat is so pissed off.  Well, yeah, because the whole key to Bad Boy Bubby, he mimics what's around him.  That's the only way he can communicate.  Yeah, so after he fucks with the cat, he starts walking around on all fours, catching cockroaches, like a cat.  So he caught cockroaches and then takes their legs off and then feeds it to the cat, I guess, right?  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  So then later on, and this is all in the first ten or fifteen minutes, he's got the cat on some kind of rope leash.  He's got it tied to the chair that he usually stays in, yeah, with a rope leash, and he's dressed like his mother, stuffed himself with these big tits and everything, and he's yelling at the cat like his mother yells at him to get away.  And I don't know how they did this without any kind of cruelty to animal fucking laws being broken for the making of a movie.  Well, it was made in Australia, so.  They don't have any laws like that over there? 
[00:21:00]  Because this poor fucking cat is flopping around in that chair, scared shitless, all tangled in the leash, and the leash, the piece of string, and the chair, and he's yelling at it, and it's all scared.  I felt really bad.  That's when Derek goes, yeah, no wonder this thing hasn't been released in America.  Like the washing the cock, the sex with the mom, that really didn't bother him.  It's the fucking poor cat.  Well, he's yelling at the cat like the cat is him, like you said.  He's dressed as this awful mom who's now on screen shaving him. 
[00:21:30]  Look at that tit.  Starts.  And then later on, he's holding on to the cat and scaring it so the cat would run away, and then the cat would choke himself.  Look, Terry.  Yeah.  He's getting washed up by his mommy.  Bad boy Bubby.  Bad boy Bubby.  He's completely naked now, and his mom with the floppy, saggy boobs is washing him with a washcloth.  Now she's got to wash herself, and there she is, bathing down her boobs and her arms. 
[00:22:00]  He looks like Fredo, just sitting there staring at her.  He does look like Fredo.  Coulda go learn the incest business.  Yeah.  So there she goes.  She's getting all washed up, and now he's sitting down getting ready for a little meal.  He's just gawking at her.  There's one point where she's a little annoyed, I guess, and comes home, and he's laying in bed, and he's jacking off, waiting for mommy to come into bed.  And he takes a swipe to grab at her ass, and she slaps his hand away, and calls him disgusting, and then gets a cup of water and throws it on his dick. 
[00:22:30]  And then just comes into bed and leaves him all blue balls.  You know, I really wanted to watch this whole movie last night.  And last night I realized we, because we do this show, are so desensitized, man.  You know what I mean?  We really are.  Anyway, Paul Miller has written in.  From Sydney, I guess? 
[00:23:00]  I sent you guys Bad Boy Bubby.  It's an Aussie movie.  Sick as fuck, eh?  Ha, ha, ha.  Glad you boys love the sickness from down under.  So, I don't think anyone has seen this movie.  I mean, this is, I've never heard of this before.  Do we have extra copies?  How many copies of Bad Boy Bubby are there open?  Rob says, I just got back from Australia.  We used to watch this shit every night.  What do you mean?  People love it, I guess, down there.  What, the same movie?  Yeah.  It's just one of the, oh, we forgot to talk about how he puts the lipstick on his mom before she leaves the house for the day. 
[00:23:30]  What color is it?  Princess red.  Princess pink?  Oh, princess pink, sorry.  Princess pink?  There he is, uh, poking at the cat.  Poking at the cat.  This is all in the first ten minutes of the damn movie.  Anyway.  It's got a real cool, dreary look to it, though.  Yeah, it certainly does.  Yeah, I gotta check out the rest of this.  I mean, it was ten minutes, and we were just, we didn't even want to, like, show prep today.  We wanted to just watch the whole movie. 
[00:24:00]  Bad Boy Bubby.  Bad Boy Bubby.  Should we keep it on the background, or?  I don't want to ruin it, though.  Huh?  I don't want to ruin it for me.  Yeah, I won't get much done, either.  I'm just gonna keep, I can't wait till Mom hops on Bubby.  Yeah.  Well, you gotta see that.  You gotta see the part where they're having sex.  You're a good boy.  Hey, can we get the volume up?  Or no?  Where is it?  All right.  Bad Boy Bubby.  Catching roaches?  Yeah.  Catching roaches on the floor.  He's on the floor catching roaches as Mom cooks.  And he pulls the legs off of them.  The credits are still rolling, by the way. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, pulls the legs off the roaches, and then gives them to the cat.  Nails are dirty.  Yeah, just a tad.  Yeah.  Big, long, filthy nails.  He's all greasy.  Yeah, he looks like a cross between Fredo and Billy Bob Thornton.  Definitely.  We'll just try to get to the scene in the bedroom, and then we'll move on with the radio show.  There he's feeding the cockroaches to the twisted cat that he made twisted.  Oh, here we go.  Listen. 
[00:25:00]  That's right.  That's a good boy, Bubby.  Good boy.  Oh, he just juggles those tits as he lays on his back.  Good little boy.  Toilet?  Don't move.  And now it's the next scene.  He tells me you moved by Christ, I'll beat your brainless. 
[00:25:30]  And there she goes.  And she leaves him sitting there.  And there's the gas mask.  And there's only one, so she can leave the apartment.  And it's locked.  It's got a padlock on the door, so she can't leave.  Right.  She can't.  And there, she throws on her gas mask, and she leaves for the day.  Leaving good old Bubby to sit there and piss himself and crap himself all day long.  All right.  Hit stop.  We'll have a full review after we watch the entire movie. 
[00:26:00]  Put it back in the case and hand me my Bad Boy Bubby DVD, because I am watching this  fucker when I go home.  Wait, how many Bad Boy Bubby copies are there?  I think there should be another one laying around.  Hawk?  If there isn't one laying around, perhaps Steve can burn Bad Boy Bubby.  Bad Boy Bubba.  Well, technically you're not supposed to, because there's copyright infringement laws.  Don't want to get in trouble.  All right.  Hey, here's the guy who sent Bad Boy Bubby.  Paul Miller, what's up? 
[00:26:30]  Hey, how's your bike going?  Huh?  Hi, pool.  Shit, do I sound that much of an Aussie, do I?  Yeah, pretty good.  Australia, Sydney.  Wait, you're listening to our show in Australia right now?  Hey, what year is it there?  Oh, we're a bit ahead of you, blokes.  It's nine here.  All right.  It's nine o'clock, what, at night?  Yeah, p.m.  Nine p.m.  Are you turning a lot of Aussies on to the radio show?  Oh, I'm trying, mate.  Well, you hear us online, I'm assuming, huh? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I've got a subscription to Audible as well.  Oh, right on.  Audible.com has all our shows, and very, very soon we're going to throw volumes of Opie  and Anthony material on there.  I've got to ask you, Paul, how long have you been listening to this program?  I think I came across a virus in late 2002, just after you got kicked off.  Really, because you really know us well.  You must really be a good fan, because you know that we would enjoy this movie. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, I saw it, and you Opie would love it, you'd be puking over the freaking cockroaches,  and Jimmy would just be cranking over the old bags.  You nailed it.  That's a good one, man.  I don't know how the hell that slipped between the cracks up here.  Yeah, what's the deal with Bad Boy Bubby?  Don't give away the ending or whatever.  I don't think there's going to be a surprise ending, quite frankly.  I've got to let you in on a secret, though.  It's got a bit of, it does have a bit of a moral ending.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  There, it really pussies out towards the end.  Ah.  But does it, uh, is this like a cult film down there? 
[00:28:00]  Well, no, I've never heard of it before.  I heard of it through a bloke who's a mechanic who banged two of his own cousins.  Nice.  Yeah.  The hell's going on down there.  Oh, mate.  But yeah, I just heard about it.  He used to show it to everyone who came over to his house.  I saw it and thought it'd be right up your bloke's own.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We just described the first ten minutes of the film.  Does it get much better?  Uh, a bit, yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  He, has Pop showed up yet?  No.  Who?  Have you seen up to Pop?  His father shows up.  No, there must be the guy that's banging on the door at the beginning.  Yeah, we hear some guy banging on the door going, I know you're in there.  That's it.  Stuff really picks up from there.  Oh, great.  He must be a prize.  Oh, don't I, I, oh, wow.  Well, I'm imagining many things with Pop and Bad Boy, Bubby.  Hey, what do you do down there, Paul?  Uh, I work for a family company. 
[00:29:00]  What is that?  The whole company I buy your family.  Oh, well, what do you do?  Uh, we make shutters, ventilation louvers, sun control stuff.  Wow.  I just like, I just like seeing the little cultural differences.  Yeah.  I thought maybe you worked as a kangaroo herder or something.  Yeah.  You guys are in now.  I'm Bobby Salesman.  Oh, God.  You guys are into spring down there, right?  Yeah, I just came into spring.  See?  Dude, that's great, huh?  By the way, I was thinking. 
[00:29:30]  The weather's beautiful.  I'm glad you boys are enjoying your rain.  No, I was thinking about that yesterday, because it's so obvious that it's going to just get worse from here.  We know that.  Yeah.  And we talked about this last winter, and we have to do this.  I'm not even kidding.  We have to broadcast somewhere else for a month.  Australia.  I don't care where.  Come down to Australia.  Go down to Manly.  You'll see tits everywhere.  Really?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Then they'll catch on big time.  Maybe Don can work on that.  Find us a warm place to broadcast, like, the month of January. 
[00:30:00]  Month of January.  Michigan.  Yeah.  Or, like, somewhere even shittier and colder than you are.  Yeah, let's go somewhere awful.  Hey, Paul.  Yeah.  Big news story down there.  What about that motorcycle that hit the kangaroo, and it was the guy that kind of came up with  the kangaroo crossing signs for the highway?  And he wound up hitting a kangaroo with his motorcycle.  Is he dead?  He got really fucked up.  Is this a real story?  Yeah.  Yeah, down there in Australia.  The guy that came up with the kangaroo crossing sign, famous for it. 
[00:30:30]  Why would he be famous for that?  I was riding his motorcycle.  Yeah.  I don't know, because there's a big problem down there with hitting kangaroos.  So, you just make a sign?  Yeah.  So, he was the guy that made the kangaroo crossing sign.  He was on his motorcycle, and he hit a kangaroo.  Do you think chicks dug that?  Like, did he pull up to a sign with a kangaroo on it and go, huh?  Did he go, that's you?  It's mine.  There's a big story down here about a bloke banging rabbits, huh?  Yeah, we heard about the rabbit fucker.  There.  Is it a new one?  Well, yeah, it's on the front page down here.  Well, front page of the website. 
[00:31:00]  Oh.  Well, what's that story?  Maybe it's a new one.  No, he's been banging rabbits in his office and breaking their necks and dumping them  in women's toilets and all around the place.  Wow.  No anger there.  That's boring, though, because rabbits don't make any noise when you're having sex with them.  Chickens now, on the other hand.  Oh, yeah.  Don't go like this.  Don't go. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What do rabbits do?  They just noses twitch, they drop little scared pellets and then die.  Yeah, right.  Fat hips.  Well, Paul, we're going to watch the rest of this movie tonight and we'll have a full review  tomorrow.  Sweet. 
[00:32:00]  Glad you boys love it.  Thank you, Paul.  Thank you, pal.  Thank you, mate.  All right.  Take it easy.  Thank you, mate.  Paul Miller from down under where it's spring.  Here he goes.  That is some accent, huh?  Yeah.  All the guys have to do is come up with that accent up to America and they're fucking like  crazy.  Chicks love that accent.  Like rabbits.  Yeah.  You either sound really, really exotic and like, you know, really cool or you sound like  Paul Field.  Oh, who ruins it for every guy with an accent.  Anthony. 
[00:32:30]  Anthony.  All right.  Paul got in a little bit of a bind yesterday, huh?  What?  No trouble for Paul.  Paul got in a little trouble yesterday.  Why?  Well, apparently, we got this Halloween party coming up.  It's a big shindig.  A lot of people want to come to this.  It's a hot ticket, as they say.  Hot ticket.  It's first come, first serve, really.  It's going to be about 600 people.  Hard Rock Cafe.  Times Square.  Halloween night.  New York City, Halloween night, O&A costume party. 
[00:33:00]  And a lot of people are calling up and writing emails saying, and posting on message boards  saying, look, I live in California.  I'd love to come to the party, but I can't fly out.  Why did you say California?  Because I picked the furthest state in the contiguous United States.  I would have said Des Moines.  Des Moines, Iowa.  Just some weird place that no one knows where it is.  All right.  Des Moines.  Someone from Des Moines has been emailing and saying, if I fly all the way from Des Moines 
[00:33:30]  and I don't get into the party, it's going to stink.  So can I please get in?  And I guess Steve, for a couple of people, because it was only like a couple of people,  said, yeah, no problem.  But don't spread it around that I let you do this.  And then all of a sudden, it ends up on Wackbag.  Hey, if you need a ticket, if you're out of state and you need a guarantee that you're 
[00:34:00]  going to get in to get on the list, they're calling it the list, email Steve and he'll  put you on the list.  And Steve just got bombarded with these emails.  So I get an email from Steve going, who the fuck is telling people that there's a list?  It must be on a message board.  So after a little research, it is found out that it's none other than No Filter Paul.  His big stupid post is right there on the message board.  Hey, just email Steve. 
[00:34:30]  Just email Steve, it said, if you want to get on the list for the party.  I heard Steve got like 333 emails.  333, that's preposterous.  As long as no niggas come in.  You fucking racist.  The worst.  That was a great, like, Ant's Mind pause voice impression.  Yeah, no shit.  Maybe I could do this all day. 
[00:35:00]  Well, we're going to give away free passes, what, next week?  To some lucky people to guarantee them a spot at the Halloween party?  Yeah, we realize that some of the out-of-state people do have a little bit of a problem with this,  and we're going to give away a few.  There's no list.  There's no emailing Steve anymore.  That's it.  That stupid limey wrecked it.  And then I get the emails from Ben.  One of them is like, I've had it with that motherfucker, Paul.  And then Steve just wrote, it was a simple two-word post, limey motherfucker. 
[00:35:30]  Well, what happened?  Was bad boy Ben upset?  He just wants to stand naked and have his hog washed.  Except for the version, he's in, the old lady would have to use a fire hose to clean the underside of it.  Bad boy Ben.  Stay righty.  Oh, you know the Photoshop is coming on Wacktack.  Bad boy Ben.  Bad boy Ben.  What a, I can't, I gotta see the rest of this movie now. 
[00:36:00]  I have to.  All right.  We got a little quick audio on the flooding in the Northeast because it's just like New Orleans, Anthony.  So let's go to the tape here.  Yes.  In the rain battered Northeast, the relentless soaking is unavoidable.  Sending people from their homes.  As the water surged to three and four feet in the streets here in Lodi, New Jersey, firefighters evacuated some residents before it got any worse.  These people have been living in these areas their entire lives. 
[00:36:30]  And they know when we get a lot of rain, it floods their basements.  The basement gets flooded.  And it floods the parts of the first floor.  Yeah, the streets.  It's the risk you take living in this area.  Right.  This is not, this is another non-story.  The people down there know if it rains heavy for more than a few days, this is what's going to happen.  Put your, uh, put your stuff up on cinder blocks.  This isn't like a levee breaking or anything like that.  This is just water rising, unfortunately, because they've had too much rain.  They love evacuations. 
[00:37:00]  On New York's Long Island, drivers stranded in the roads were rescued by crews in boats.  It went on all day.  I wouldn't want to walk into that.  I would fall.  And I haven't been swimming lately in the road.  So I wasn't free.  This car skidded into a swollen lake.  Another rescue.  This is the worst.  This is the worst.  It's like about, uh, I've seen it probably, like, maybe three or four feet.  This looks like five, six feet.  It's real bad.  Oh, wow.  Inch upon inch rains down for yet another day. 
[00:37:30]  In New Hampshire, which took the brunt of the storms last weekend,  people got a fleeting break Wednesday from the torrents that swept away roads, cars, boats, and homes.  As dogs and helicopters searched for those still missing,  the governor met with residents who don't have homes or flood insurance.  If we spend all of our money from our retirements and stuff to fix up our house again,  it's just going to happen again.  And forecasters say this weekend there will be more heavy rain. 
[00:38:00]  I mean, it's close, but we're hoping it stays where it belongs.  I mean, we haven't lived here long, and so far so good, but we're hoping.  What was that woman crying about?  I don't really want to hear her again.  Is that about retirement money?  The retirement money.  Shut up, burden.  Exactly.  All right, hold on.  I think it's around here somewhere.  You've contributed.  Thank you. 
[00:38:30]  Now die.  It's swept away roads, cars, boats, and homes.  As dogs and helicopters searched for those still missing,  the governor met with residents who don't have homes or flood insurance.  If we spend all of our money from our retirements and stuff to fix up our house again,  it's just going to happen again.  And forecasters say this weekend there will be more heavy rain.  It's close, but we're hoping it stays where it belongs. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, we haven't lived here long, and so far so good, but we're hoping.  Relax, all right?  My old man is a television repairman.  He's got the ultimate set of tools.  I can fix it.  Help her out, Sir Coley.  We spend our retirement money.  Oh, geez, you've lived long enough.  Joe Shareholder.  Hi, how are you?  What's up?  I've got a joke. 
[00:39:30]  Why aren't you guys on XM Pops Channel 113?  Oh, wait, I was thinking of the Opus and Anthony show.  You.  Dick.  Joe.  Yes?  We make stars on a daily basis with this radio show, and you're not one of them.  It's over.  I don't think you got my joke, Opus.  What?  I don't think you got my joke, Opus.  It's like a... 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, no, we got it.  Oh.  Trust me.  Oh, come on.  That's fucking hilarious.  Joe Shareholder is trying to become our latest discovery, and it's just not going to happen.  It's over, Joe.  I'm sorry.  You're not going to be on Maury Povich like Stalker Patty was yesterday.  You're no big A.  Stalker Patty was on Maury Povich yesterday.  Maury, yesterday.  Ooh.  50-year-old virgin.  They had Patty on.  Apparently, the taping went very well.  They took our idea. 
[00:40:30]  We had Maury Povich in, and we said, hey, you know, especially because, you know, the 40-year-old virgin is a hot movie right now, or was.  Yeah.  You should do a show on, you know, people that are still virgins, and we have one.  It's Patty, and she's 50.  So they did a show on Patty yesterday.  Stalker Patty was on Maury yesterday.  And then they gave her a makeover.  Did it air, or when is it air?  No, it hasn't aired yet.  They haven't decided.  I mean, if it's really good, they'll save it for sweeps in November.  If it's just an average show, they'll probably throw it on the air very soon. 
[00:41:00]  Without even seeing it, I have the whole show in my head.  I know exactly how it went.  You know, she comes out.  They talk a little about it, and then it's like, we're going to give you a makeover, Patty.  And the audience goes crazy.  And then she goes, yeah, makes a stupid face and gets shuffled off all awkwardly.  And then later on in the show, Maury comes out.  You remember Patty, don't you, people?  Patty.  Let's see that before picture.  There's the before picture. 
[00:41:30]  Well, we gave Patty a makeover, and I'd like to introduce to you now the new Patty.  Bring her up.  Yeah, look at her.  She's beautiful.  And Patty comes out doing some kind of bad posing runway walk in her new duds with her  makeup on, clown makeup on.  I hear she has a new hairdo, new glasses, new wardrobe.  I think she's coming in today to talk about her experience on the Maury Povich show. 
[00:42:00]  They gave her new glasses.  What else?  They colored her hair, too.  Oh, they colored her hair.  What color?  Like blonde highlights.  Blonde.  They did not give Stalker Patty one highlights.  He gave me one highlight.  Oh, my God.  What time is she coming in today?  You don't know.  She must have looked like Marilyn Monroe, but not M-O-N, M-U-N from Too Close for Comfort.  I got to make a... 
[00:42:30]  You are beautiful, Patty.  Look at you.  Yeah.  And Maury, like, just spreading it on thick.  He's like, where's Patty?  And they hit her in a garbage can.  Patty.  Patty.  Come on.  Oh, I didn't know you were there hiding in that pile of two-by-fours.  Well, that's exciting, though.  Exciting for the show, too. 
[00:43:00]  We get some major plugs and...  Yeah, apparently we get some mentions and...  Some B-roll of us in the studio.  Some B-roll of us in the studio with Patty.  Gee, I wonder if they show the Krusty the Clown mask segment.  She's naked crawling across the studio to get some money so she can pay her bills.  Do you think they show the Ron Jeremy video where she had to reach down Ron Jeremy's pants for U2 tickets?  Maybe her hairy nipples.  Oh, hairy nipples.  By Jim Norton.  By Jimmy.  One of my first...  Or the time we took the wig after we shaved her head. 
[00:43:30]  There's a video of that as well.  Of course.  Maybe it's the time we had the vibrator, the remote control vibrator down her pants and kept turning it on in the middle of her talking.  Wow!  Well, we're going to get to see what that's all about later today.  Stalker Patty will be in studio.  All right?  All right.  Good.  I say we do a little break.  A little breakage?  A little break.  When we get back, we've got a bunch of things to get to, including the Bill Burr versus Jimmy Norton campaign ads. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, now I've heard this campaign is taken to mudslinging.  It's getting a little nasty.  Is it getting ugly?  It's getting ugly.  It's getting a little ugly.  Well, we did a whole thing on political ads while you were gone.  Oh, the Jersey run that they're doing over there.  The Doug Forrester.  Doug Forrester.  And Corzine, right?  Yeah.  And Corzine are going at it.  Doug Forrester likes touching children.  It's pretty much what they're doing. 
[00:44:30]  They might as well.  They use the grainy video and put it in super slow motion when they show the opponent and put it in black and white.  So it could be him at a children's cancer hospital handing out little cancer-curing lollipops to the kids,  and it would look like he's just Satan himself.  Do we still have those political ads?  Let's get those because Jimmy hasn't heard of those.  They're really good.  They make one of the guys sound like he's in the mafia.  They have, like, secret audio and stuff.  They have secret audio of the bosses.  And he's talking about Democratic bosses, like the Democratic bigwigs. 
[00:45:00]  Dem bosses.  He's in secret meetings with Dem bosses talking about payoffs.  Like Dem bosses, almost.  Yeah.  Like Dem bosses.  It's such a crappy, fake thing to do.  Like, it's lying.  The guy's lying in his ads.  You know what's stupid?  At the end of it, they'll congratulate the other guy.  Yeah.  Like it was all on the up and up.  Yeah, like it was, yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Meanwhile, they were just stabbing each other in the back. 
[00:45:30]  Doug Forrester.  And the music they play, it's like movie trailer music.  They use, like, this ominous dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum behind the opponent.  And then when they talk about themselves,  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, the nice, happy music comes on.  Cha-cha-cha.  Scumbag.  Well, if McGreevy got busted, his opponent would have had an easy time.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  She showed herself one.  Pussy.  I love it.  Well, they drag McGreevy's name into this whole thing. 
[00:46:00]  Like, hey, he knows McGreevy, so you know what that means.  McGreevy's a cocksucker.  All right, we got the ads.  We got the political ads.  We'll play them after break, and then we'll take it to the next level,  because I guess Danny came up with this idea.  Danny.  Got to give props to Danny today.  Wow.  The Bill Burr versus Jimmy Norton campaign ads.  They're really, really funny.  We'll do all that after these messages.  We got commercials today.  Words.  Promos. 
[00:46:30]  PSAs.  Wow Sweeper.  F.U. Line.  Ramon promo.  Nothing.  George Carlin bit.  Yeah?  George Carlin?  What?  You got me really funny.  Oh, wow.  Oh, dude.  I thought you were trying to get him back by just stopping and calling him on it.  Oh.  I thought for once he was bringing something to the show.  I can't even look at you.  I thought for once he actually brought something in to talk about.  I did.  I brought in my Apple and my Starbucks.  You didn't bring one thought star today, did you? 
[00:47:00]  Not true at all.  He brought his fancy Hollywood self.  That's right.  I thought you might have had something.  Babe.  Oh.  Welcome to the O.P.  And Andrew.  Oh, dinner.  Hey, man.  Here you go.  No, no, no.  That's cool.  Keep it.  Keep it.  Mmm. 
[00:47:30]  Chicken.  Be the help is all that you can learn.  So be the help is all that you can learn.  Audio Slave.  Checked out that DVD last night, too.  Not bad.  First rock band to play in Cuba.  First American rock band to play in Cuba.  Very interesting documentary about their experience. 
[00:48:00]  You're checking out the O.P.  and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Oy.  It's a virus.  The O.N.A.  virus.  Spread the virus to your friends, please.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  The O.N.A.  flu.  The O.N.A.  flu.  Yeah.  Worse than the bird flu.  This is worse than the bird flu because we're infecting more people than the bird flu.  Every day.  Guarantee we're infecting more people than the bird flu.  Yep.  It's an O.N.A.  pandemic.  Hopi.  O.N.A.  pandemic.  Yeah, because we got that call from Australia.  So you're right. 
[00:48:30]  That applies.  Let's say hi to Mike in New Jersey.  We got a G-Rock radio update.  Oh, G-Rock.  You want to explain this really fast, Anthony?  In 30 seconds?  We were talking about that yesterday.  It seems a married couple that does morning radio.  Boring!  Ha, ha, ha.  Married couple is doing a promotion to fight breast cancer.  They're spending their show in bed.  They're at a Rockaway bedding, I guess, in Jersey, just laying in bed doing their radio  shows.  Probably have little trays on their stomach with their eggs and bacon, and they're a couple 
[00:49:00]  just like at home, and they have their microphones, and they're doing their little radio show from  bed to fight breast cancer.  Mike!  What's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Hey, Mike.  You got a G-Rock radio update?  I do.  I was just looking for the radio show, and they're playing music now, but they're talking  about the terrible elements they're out in, and how it's not just radio shit, and all  other nonsense and BS, but they must be freezing out there, because they're begging people to 
[00:49:30]  come in and give money, and they're saying if people just drive up and hand money out of  the car, they'll run up and grab money.  So I think we'd send some shit out.  They're in a tent, I guess, in the parking lot of a Rockaway bedding, and one side of  the tent has plastic, so I guess you could see them laying in bed.  Yeah.  And they must not have heaters, I guess.  Yeah.  But you're in bed with your wife.  How the fuck could you not keep warm?  Just pull the covers over you, pull your hog out, rub it on her thigh a little bit. 
[00:50:00]  You're disgusting, Bubby.  Bad Boy Bubby.  Pull a Bad Boy Bubby on the bitch.  Nothing but Bad Boy Bubby references all morning long.  What the Bad Boy Bubby?  I can't get enough of it.  Bad Boy Ben has got to be one of the funniest things.  Bad Boy Ben.  Ah!  I crap myself.  Sitting at his friggin' computer, just highlighting and unhighlighting and pissing and shitting  himself.  Not even a real connection to the internet, just little baby legs sticking straight out.  He's wearing a little Red Sox hat and diapers. 
[00:50:30]  All right, Mike.  We're going to look for someone that has a better cell phone that can maybe play the  show for us today so we can see what they're up to.  All right, guys.  All right.  G-Rock Radio.  We got Wacky Radio all over the place.  You got G-Rock Radio desperate to raise money.  I guess they just don't have an audience because they're still there.  You know, $50,000 seems like it would be real easy to raise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If they had an audience.  Sell your junk.  It's easy. 
[00:51:00]  In other radio news.  Oh, that's them?  Well, that's a lot.  Wow.  You got a live shot of them?  This is what they're...  This is it?  That's what they're doing?  They're just laying in a bed with the Rockaway Bedding logo right above them.  And that's all they're doing?  They're just laying there?  And people walk by and stare at them?  Look at this guy in the hood like, oh, wow.  That was worth the drive from New York City.  You got people just filing by like it's a casket. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of creepy.  It looks like a funeral.  Look.  Uh.  Yep.  Oh, I'm so sad.  They're in bed, all right.  Wouldn't be bad if someone had an Opie and Anthony shirt and just kind of stood in front of that  camera.  That wouldn't be...  That's not a bad thing to do if you're just looking and donating a buck.  Just donating.  I got a buck.  Yeah.  That would be great for the three people looking at this.  Oh, I'm sure this is...  This is giving me...  This is video feed.  All the country people are watching this.  Oh, I'm sure they are.  This is G-Rock Radio.  And then you got some sales guy just staring at them.  I'm trying to find that.  Oh, this is the same guy just pacing back and forth. 
[00:52:00]  There's no one even really passing by.  Holy crap.  Is that under events?  Uh, no.  It's under disasters.  Oh, wow.  Well, they're doing a good thing, so who are we?  In other wacky radio news, Anthony, our old station when we were syndicated across America  on commercial radio, WCKG in Chicago, they had a few staffers arrested for their Wake  the Angels stunt.  Oh, boy. 
[00:52:30]  Now, we make fun of a lot of radio shows out there because they're doing the hacky, wacky  radio, right?  Yep.  I think we got to give props to these guys today.  Yeah, this kind of comes off like a good one.  Chicago's baseball fans, whether they prefer the White Sox or the Cubs, have been starved for  an MLB championship since the Woodrow Wilson administration.  So perhaps, excuse me, it's understandable why WCKG sports reporter Ryan Mender Mendenhall  and an intern pulled their Wake the Angels stunt on Tuesday, which got them arrested for 
[00:53:00]  criminal trespassing, according to Chicago's NBC5 News.  Congrats, guys.  Mendenhall and intern Carl Clockhurst were arrested after knocking on the doors of hotel rooms  occupied by players from the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim who were in town this week for  a playoff series against the White Sox.  The incident allegedly happened hours after the Angels arrived in Chicago on a red-eye flight  after beating the New York Yankees and hours before the team was scheduled to play the Sox.  Both WCKG staffers were charged with criminal trespass to land, which is a misdemeanor. 
[00:53:30]  Pretty good, though.  Waking up the team like that, because they were exhausted.  Play the Yankees, get on a plane, end up in your hotel, you want to go to sleep, and all  of a sudden, knock on the door.  Oh, how pissed.  That's a great idea.  How pissed.  It's a great idea, and a lot of people are talking about WCKG and these two guys today.  Didn't Anaheim win the game, though, the next day?  Yeah, so.  It didn't work very well. 
[00:54:00]  Nah.  It was just a quick little disturbance, and they went back to bed, I'm sure.  Who got robbed last night?  I believe the Angels did, and I hate the Angels.  The Angels would have robbed.  What happened?  They got robbed.  It was apparently, I didn't see it, but what's happening is there was some kind of  like a third strike.  It was a tie game in the ninth inning, and someone could call it, correct me if I'm wrong,  and the guy, there's two outs, and one of the White Sox players at bat, and he swings  and misses, catcher catches the ball, and then kind of jumps up and just rolls the ball  to the mound, and the umpire called strike three, and I guess the, I don't know, the 
[00:54:30]  guy ran to first thinking that the catcher dropped the ball, and one of the umpires  said that he didn't catch it correctly, so that he would, the guy took first, and it  was acceptable.  Uh-huh.  Apparently replay shows that it was caught cleanly.  It was caught, yeah, it didn't hit the ground.  And that turned into a run?  The guy stole second, or the pinch runner stole second, and I think he got singled in,  and that won the game.  I could be wrong, I could be giving, but that's basically the thrust of it, and they  were robbed by a shitty umpire call.  Wow.  Scumbag umpires.  Uh, well, Kevin from Chicago is saying, don't give these guys props, they're terrible. 
[00:55:00]  Kevin?  Of course they are.  Yeah, CKG is bad.  They got like Howard, and they got Steve Dowd.  Anybody who lives in Chicago, Steve Dowd's been doing the same shit longer than Howard has,  dude.  I'm not going to lie to you, I've never heard, uh, you know, WCKG, so I don't know how bad the  radio is, but this, this prank seems pretty cool.  Well, but they've done it before, and like the, Pete McMurray, the guy that did it, dude,  he's like the, he's like a fucking Reddit, it's stuff titled Chicago Radio, he's been  on every station. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, one of those guys.  He's bad.  Yeah.  All right.  Chicago Radio is so fucking lame.  All right, should we, uh, throw him on the fuck-o list?  Oh, definitely, fuck-o list.  Fuck-o.  We are, we are building that fuck-o list, and I guess our golden ticket thing has to,  has to, has to be put on the back burner for a while.  Oh?  I think so.  Yeah.  We got Ron and Fez, they're doing great, we're going to probably, um, hire a few things  for the weekends, and then, uh, as far as full-time shows, I think we're going to have  to wait a little longer.  We need another channel, is what we need. 
[00:56:00]  Well, there was something that was, uh, supposed to happen, and I don't think it's, it's going  to happen, is what I'm hearing, so we're going to have to just wait for a while.  Oh, boy.  No, because a lot of people are asking, when are you going to give away the next golden  ticket?  Yeah.  And, uh, I think we'll give a couple things, uh, for the weekends, and then, then we're  going to have to wait on the rest for now.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Yeah.  That makes sense, no?  Did someone Photoshop me as the, the mask kid?  Oh, really?  Ha ha ha!  Jesus.  Yeah, I, uh, I, I was scanning all my old pictures, because I, I went over to my mom's 
[00:56:30]  house, and all she has is, like, these albums with old pictures in them that are  deteriorating, you know?  Absolutely.  They're going to, uh, deteriorate.  So I scanned them all, and I've been popping a few up online so they could Photoshop them,  and some of these people are brilliant.  Some of these pictures of me are, are from, uh, when I was, you know, eight, nine years  old, ten, and it was right when my hair turned.  It went from straight to curly, and this in-between phase is so awful, and, uh, it's hysterical. 
[00:57:00]  So I, I just put them up online, and they Photoshopped me.  You know what your hair looks like?  They made me black in one.  That was one of the really, really good ones.  You know what your hair looks like?  What?  Whoa!  Whoa!  Yeah.  There's some...  It's a rollercoaster.  Oh, I know.  They put me together with Jimmy, little Jimmy's picture.  I really looked like a lesbian when I was 11.  You really did, with those big, dopey glasses?  Were you, like, were you farsighted or nearsighted? 
[00:57:30]  I couldn't see far away, so I did.  Like, out of the womb?  What the fuck?  What kid?  I was 11.  You're one of those kids that they had to strap the glasses on the infant?  Isn't that bad?  You ever see that poor kid?  Like, a kid in a stroller, you know they're newborn, and they got glasses on?  Can I say how fucking molestable you were as a child?  Oh, look.  What a waif.  Look at my little, hustlable hair.  Little broad smile.  Yeah, you look like you could have been a child star or something.  Like a little boy girl.  You can't tell what gender this is.  Exactly. 
[00:58:00]  Little Joyce DeWitt.  That was me.  All these pictures are up on Wackbag, right?  Oh, yeah.  But the newborns with the glasses.  Yeah, newborns with glasses.  How do the mothers know?  You think, like, instead of, like, sucking on a tit, they were sucking on her elbow or  something?  They couldn't figure it out?  Because that's pretty much all the kid's got to do, is make his way to the tit.  If you can't do that, throw glasses on the kid.  How do they tell?  I don't know.  Like, because you know how it is.  Well, you do.  I don't. 
[00:58:30]  I don't have glasses.  I got glasses at eight years old.  But you had to go in, and the guy asks you questions and everything.  He wants to be answered immediately.  But it's not like a baby can, you know, all right, does that look better?  Is that good?  How do they know what the baby needs?  What kind of prescription a baby needs for glasses?  Right.  When they can't even talk.  By the way, sorry to interrupt you, I just saw that play.  It doesn't.  He caught it.  It could go either way, I think.  Really?  Well, yeah, if you watch it again, you can see the way he, especially since the cash just  jumped up and threw the ball, he would have tagged the guy. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  It just looks like, I don't know.  It looked like he could have went either way.  It looked like he could have either bounced really fast in front of him, or he got it clean.  It's tough to tell from the angle I just saw.  I don't know.  Oh, big XM logo.  Look at the XM logo on left field.  Come on, XM satellite radio.  Nice.  By the way, we just made another huge deal with Honda.  Where's the press release?  Maybe Eric Logan could call us and tell us what's going on with Honda.  Wait, didn't they have a deal with Honda already?  Yeah, but there's a, I don't know, starting with the 2006 models, it's going to be up 
[00:59:30]  to 550,000 XM radios installed or something like that.  I don't have it in front of me.  What happened to my Honda?  So maybe Elo, who listens to the show every day, could call us right now and give us the  latest on the Honda deal.  That would be great.  And he could also maybe fess up and tell us live on the air that we're not going to  be part of XM Canada, it looks like.  Oh.  Something's going on.  Something's going on.  We'll figure it out.  Because XM Canada is about ready to go, and they're only taking 80 channels. 
[01:00:00]  They're only taking 80 of the 100 and, what is it, up to 62 XM channels.  So that makes me think we're not going to be part of XM Canada.  And I think it's because they have their very strict broadcasting rules up there.  That's amazing.  It really is.  Honestly, God, it's like a communist country there with the language restrictions.  It really is disgraceful.  And it's not even so much the sex stuff as the race stuff.  You can't make a race joke up there.  It is over, Johnny, if you do that on the air.  It really is. 
[01:00:30]  It's frightening, man.  They think they're such a free and advanced country, and yet they have that real language  restriction on stuff that's just...  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to see what that's all about.  So if Eric Logan is listening right now, give us a call.  We won't beat you up.  I just want to know what's going on with XM Canada in general.  When does it start?  You know, I want to hear about the Honda deal.  I want to hear about possible video.  Because now we've got the iPod thing.  We've got iPod TV.  Right.  We've got the front page of the New York Post today. 
[01:01:00]  iPod TV.  iPod TV.  $300 gadget to play top shows right on the iPod.  Pretty risky.  Pretty risky move.  They're saying that the iPod TV is not going to be as popular as the iPod.  Because you could listen to music anywhere, doing anything.  You're in an elevator.  You're a bike messenger.  You're working.  Exercising.  Exercising.  Good.  But to watch a show takes a lot more attention than just listening to music. 
[01:01:30]  So video on the go like this is still kind of an iffy thing.  If you're on a plane or a train or something, you'd want something a little bigger than a  two and a half inch screen to look at.  I have to disagree.  And I'll tell you.  All right.  I was at the time.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  I was at the Time Warner building, Columbus Circle there, in the Samsung store.  And I was looking at the new devices they have to play movies and video.  They are fucking tiny. 
[01:02:00]  And the quality is unbelievable.  And you can hold it just like this.  No, I'm not saying it's totally useless.  I mean, there are some times where you're going to...  That'll come in handy.  I think we ought to get right on the fucking ball here with this program and start selling  some shit to download into video.  Porno is just huge.  People love the porno.  Imagine if you could download the Wiffle Ball Back Challenge into your video iPod.  And watch it there. 
[01:02:30]  People would love that shit.  So how do we get this going?  I don't know.  I got my new phone, which gets like a video on demand.  So I could watch cartoon clips.  I watch Fox News live on my way walking down the sidewalk.  I watch Fox News.  Live feed Fox News to my phone.  And I watch that.  And the screen is even smaller than the iPod thing.  But you could also...  They're getting more and more stuff you can download.  Right.  One-time things for a fee you download.  I'm like, why the hell isn't this program available on some kind of phone service or 
[01:03:00]  now the iPod service where you can download segments of the show?  When we do something that is visually appealing, it should be made available for download.  Because we have an agent that only knows radio?  Oh, God.  I hear you guys, you know, we're going to have this medium.  It's played on something called a Victrola.  And we're going to put it out and it's going to make you guys huge.  The future, Bob.  Bob Eatman.  The future.  Look at it.  It's all over the place.  It's...  You know, we should be involved with this stuff. 
[01:03:30]  We should be involved with all this cutting-edge technology.  But I guess the point you're making, you know...  Opie was hot for my deal, wasn't he?  Yeah.  But I think...  Which chance are you going to be, Opie?  I think the iPod TV is going to take off.  A lot of people on the subways and the trains and when they travel, of course.  Someone's got to shoot Bob while he's picking up some fruit.  Jesus.  But the quality is right there with the stuff I was looking at at Samsung.  It was unbelievable.  And how light it was.  I couldn't believe it.  They're actually thinner than a regular iPod, these video iPods. 
[01:04:00]  Really?  That's something.  What's going on when you're working out, though?  If you're on a bike or something and you want to have a little TV, that's probably where  people will buy them.  Yeah.  But even now, you're moving.  It's hard to watch.  They have TVs in the gym.  Well, the car...  Yeah.  But, I mean, this is where you can just download programs into the iPod, right?  Yeah.  This is something also, not just the iPod itself, the video iPod itself, but the way  they distribute programming now.  This changes a lot of stuff.  The first show, I guess, is Desperate Housewives.  Okay.  It's going to be made available the day after it airs.  Right.  For $2.99.  Right.  $2.99. 
[01:04:30]  You download it.  Now you can watch it if you want.  Of course, that show, awful, horrible.  But this is now a new distribution method for TV shows that's going to make them more  money.  $3, though, an episode?  $3 an episode.  It's the first thing.  You know, I'm sure the price will come down after a while.  You know what, though?  Once you get some competition.  For those hot shows, that one show that you like, you're going to pay $3 an episode,  of course.  But if you've got a DVR at home, you would just record it.  They don't have the DVR yet.  TiVo?  They don't have the TiVo.  VCR? 
[01:05:00]  They don't have it.  VCR?  Jesus.  No, but this is something you could download right to your iPod as you're going on a business  trip or on vacation.  Or you've got the long commute on a train.  Long Island fucking railroad.  If I could watch Curb Your Enthusiasm on a little device as I was coming in when I was  doing that commute, I would be paying $3 left and right.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Your favorite show?  Fuck yeah, man.  They have a thing.  Keith has it.  It's probably the size.  It's probably like two inches, three inches one way and like seven inches the other way. 
[01:05:30]  You ever see it?  It's like a little screen, but it's big enough to watch shows on.  It's like a little iPod.  It's got music.  It's got everything on it.  You know what I'm talking about?  It looks like a long biker wallet.  Oh, is that the...  I think it's Sony, I think.  Yeah, that's the Sony PSP.  It's the one that says, bad motherfucker.  Yeah.  And is that the PSP?  Second reference.  The PSP.  Isn't that the PSP where you can play games, download movies and all that?  Yeah, and do everything on it.  Don Wicklund has one of those.  But I'm telling you, they're getting smaller than that. 
[01:06:00]  That almost looks too big now.  The stuff I was seeing from Samsung, and I keep saying Samsung because that's where I discovered  this stuff, but I'm sure they're all doing it now.  But it's all going to come down to the phone.  Right.  It's all going to be incorporated into the telephone.  The cell phone is something, I don't care who you are, that is what you carry with you.  Whether you're a Joe businessman or a homeless guy.  I saw a homeless guy on a cell phone, which I did not understand where to send the bill. 
[01:06:30]  He's talking on a cell phone.  Everyone has that.  So all this new stuff has to be incorporated into a cell phone.  They're already doing the video on demand.  They're already putting the music players in them.  And then it's just got to get to the point where they can cram all this shit in there.  XM Satellite Radio, put that in there.  How about that?  I'm going to make a statement.  Oh, go ahead.  I think eventually XM Satellite Radio is going to have to change its name.  To what? 
[01:07:00]  XM Satellite Entertainment.  Entertainment.  Ooh.  Because now that I see iPod TV, you've got to think the guys in the lab.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  I don't know.  Because, you know, you've got to be careful with this type of information.  You're just speculating.  I truly don't know.  They didn't even let you in the goddamn secret room.  So people know I don't know.  But you've got to think the guys in the lab are already working on this stuff.  You've just got to think it.  Yeah.  You've got to think it.  Because this is where it's all going.  They're so far ahead of the curve, of course.  And then eventually, I don't think it's going to be about just radio. 
[01:07:30]  I think that's where I see the business going, where it's all-encompassing.  It's radio.  It's TV.  TV, video, distribution of movies.  Just information in general that doesn't fall into radio or TV.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That's where I see the whole thing going with the business we're in.  The whole thing, I love, though, the video on demand on your goddamn phone.  And we should be a part of that.  We should absolutely be a part of that, where you can download video. 
[01:08:00]  We shoot everything that happens in this studio that's visually appealing to the audience.  That should be made available over Sprint or one of these phone services where you can just go to the link, download it, and there.  Now you're watching the clip of what you heard on the radio.  Well, call Bob, our agent, and see if he can get on that.  Get on it.  But I'm sure he's too busy dealing with a situation in, I don't know, Iowa, the morning show in Iowa.  Why is it always Iowa? 
[01:08:30]  Iowa is not getting three weeks vacation like they were promised, so he's battling it out with the general manager today.  I'm sure that's a big issue.  I called Bob.  I had an issue the other day about AFTRA.  I went out.  Did he call you back?  Yeah, yeah.  And he said, well, you might need AFTRA.  All right.  Well, I'm glad we talked.  That AFTRA health insurance, I don't know what most people have.  I haven't had health insurance.  It's abominable.  It's horrible.  It's a disgrace.  I told him, you're a thieving union.  You're a thieving union.  You hand the card to most doctor's offices, and they're like, what? 
[01:09:00]  What is this?  I'm so glad we're out AFTRA.  Oh, we're out.  We're paying dues for no reason.  I'll tell you one thing.  I'm pro-union, first of all.  I don't want these guys coming out of the woodwork.  I truly am.  But our union and what happened to us was a complete waste.  We had one of the biggest things happen in radio to us, and they didn't even call.  No, no, no.  They're there to protect their people, right?  We didn't even get a phone call after the whole St. Pat's thing. 
[01:09:30]  We had to search them out, and they didn't even return our calls.  No.  But they wanted their fucking dues.  Oh, every three months or so, we're sending them thousands of dollars to be in their union,  and you got nothing in return.  It was extortion.  Do you know...  We got absolutely nothing out of them.  SAG and AFTRU were going to merge, and of course SAG rejected it because AFTRU is shit.  And Lucky Louie, thank God, is SAG, so I'll be able to get full medical from SAG, because  I have it from AFTRU.  And you know what they do?  I understand that there's network providers and out-of-network, but my podiatrist, because 
[01:10:00]  of my foot, I should have had to have surgery.  Your foot on your foot.  My fucking foot thing on my foot is helping me stay away from surgery.  She's very good.  She's expensive, but I'm like, I got insurance.  They pay, because it's out-of-network, they pay 60% of what they consider to be the average  in that area.  These motherfuckers.  So, like, she charges, say she charges $300 for a visit, which is very expensive, but  she's doing ultrasound, all this shit on your foot. 
[01:10:30]  They don't pay 60% of $300, which I could live with.  All right, fine.  She's expensive, but she's saving me, she's helping me make money by keeping me out of  surgery.  They take the average of what they think the cost should be, which they take the whole  New York area.  So these fucking pieces of thieving shit include Washington Heights, they include everywhere  in New York where you could probably get the same thing by some awful doctor for 60 bucks.  And they average it out, and this is what you should be paying, so we'll pay 60% of that.  What did the number come out to? 
[01:11:00]  One bill I got was for three different things, orthotics and this and that.  The whole thing came to $12.50, which was expensive.  They paid $300 and something dollars of it.  These thieves.  They are thieves.  Absolute scum.  And this is after health.  The actual union, to me, is of no value, but after health should just be firebombed.  They're awful.  And they're ripping people off, man.  It's horrible.  I think my stupid unclogged throat would help.  There you go.  All right. 
[01:11:30]  In other technology news, does this fall under technology?  Oh, the last thing about Samsung.  So I was there, and they had an 80-inch plasma TV.  80?  Wow.  And they had a couch right in front of it, so we sat down in front of the couch, and they  were playing some promotional video of festivals of Europe or something like that.  Festivus.  So they're just showing all these cool things that you could see in Europe, basically.  And it was just...  High def, of course.  It was unbelievable. 
[01:12:00]  And I'm sitting there, and I was thinking to myself, hmm, hmm, I'm thinking I might want  an 80-inch plasma TV.  Yeah.  I swear to God, I'm thinking that, right?  I'm thinking, you know, we had a pretty good year at XM.  We just celebrated a year on the air.  Maybe I should treat myself to an 80-inch plasma TV.  A little treat.  So I'm sitting there, and I'm getting a little excited, because now I'm thinking in my head,  I swear to God, I'm thinking, $10,000, $20,000?  You know, why not?  Why not?  Yeah.  Why not spend some money for once? 
[01:12:30]  Oops.  I'm thinking $10,000 or $20,000.  I know.  That's a lot.  And I'm really debating this in my head, right?  I know.  You already know.  You just earned that.  You already know where I'm going.  The time we've been here.  But I'm seriously debating this in my head.  Should I just step up and do it?  An 80-inch plasma TV.  So I finally, like, to the sales guy, like, I'm ready to do some wheeling and dealing.  Well, assistant, sir.  And, you know, I'm with my chick, right?  So I'm looking like a big shot. 
[01:13:00]  Watch what I do now.  The cock of the walk.  I stick my chest out.  I'm interested in that 80-inch plasma TV.  He goes, you do realize that there's only three in the world, right?  Yes.  Did you say that?  Yeah.  Well, your mouth gets dry.  Yeah.  I realize that.  Because I already committed, and I'm trying to look like a big shot, you know?  Three in the world.  And there's people kind of looking in on this whole process.  He goes, you realize there's three in the world.  That's one of them. 
[01:13:30]  And I'm like, oh.  One belongs to Mr. Gates.  Of course.  So I guess they said something like they had 100-inch plasma there.  There's only one in the world, and they displayed that last week or something or a couple weeks ago.  So I go, yeah.  How much would something like that run a person?  And I'm still hoping maybe, you know.  Now I'm thinking, all right, 10 to 20, it's got to be 20,000, right?  And he goes, oh, that TV right there goes for $150,000.  Ah, $150,000.  And you had to act like that was the range that you kind of figured it might be in? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm like, well, okay.  Well, that sounds reasonable.  No, he knew right away, because then he walked right away to the next person that had a question.  He knew there wasn't even a chance that he was making a deal.  Just put it on your Amex Centurion.  Did you put it on that one?  The black card?  I felt like such a dick that I low-balled it so much in my own head, thinking, 20 Gs.  I'm thinking 20 Gs.  I'm on it.  You're looking to see if it could fit in your car?  Yeah, I could get that in there. 
[01:14:30]  What do you need?  I had the wall in my apartment in my mind, like, yeah, that one wall there.  Yeah.  How did I get that through the door?  Huh?  How did I get that through your door, dude?  They'd have to cut your, they'd have to knock brick out.  You'd have to remodel the entire building.  You'd have to get, like, a building code.  You couldn't put that in your apartment.  Dude, it's, it's plasma.  It's, it's, it's thin.  It's like, it's, it's five inches thick.  No, no, no.  At the most.  But it's long.  It's 80 inches long.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  How high is it?  Like, how would you, like, how would you, you're trying to maneuver a couch through your 
[01:15:00]  front door?  Dude.  Yeah, but a couch isn't flat.  I'd tell the famous.  It's like a, it's a board.  As long as you can get it into, what do you got a wall right when you walk in?  What's your apartment like?  Open the door, make quick left or right.  There's a wall right there.  That's a big, that's a big TV.  That wouldn't fit in the house.  I, I, I tell the famous story.  No, I have a crib.  I tell the famous story.  I got the, uh, pretty much, I missed the boat by a week.  I, I ended up getting the, uh, the Sony, what is it, like a 50 inch picture tube? 
[01:15:30]  Jimmy moved into Bilbo Baggins' old place.  I get the, door is round.  I get the 50 inch Sony picture tube and then like the week after the plasmas and the LCDs  and the flash.  That always happens, yeah.  We're all the rage.  So I basically got the last floor model of this fucking thing.  Oh boy.  And it was the hot TV at the time.  I forget exactly what it is, but you get the idea.  It's like a 50 inch picture tube, huge, weighs like fucking 400 pounds.  And I had two gorillas roll it into my apartment.  Remember that story? 
[01:16:00]  It's a true story.  No, no, no.  Because you ask about how they get these things into your apartment.  These guys look like they just came out of prison.  And they, they tried for maybe two seconds to, you know, get it in my apartment the nice  way and then realized it wasn't going to go in.  So now they're rolling it and shoving it through the doors and then boom, boom, boom, rolling  it across my living room.  Um, no kin to delivery, man.  No, no, no.  And, and, and, you know, I had a little fear in my, my stupid brain, like, uh, like, like  we do and I didn't say anything and I just hoped that the thing was going to work after 
[01:16:30]  what they did and I lucked out.  It's fine, but they rolled it into my apartment, this huge TV.  Lucky it wasn't luggage.  End over end.  Yeah, me and Ben were talking about the high def, the high def, watching the game on that  and, uh, he's getting into watching, uh, things on the discovery channel now because, uh,  discovery high definition, all those nature shows and stuff, high definition.  So the way to go. 
[01:17:00]  I have a 50 inch, uh, it's a pioneer elite, which my friends hooked me up with.  Um, and I, I, I watch things like the European show you were talking about.  There's two HD channels where they have like the aerial views of cities.  Like they'll just take like helicopter shots over Philly.  Yeah.  I will sit there and watch it.  There's no sound.  It's just some awful narrator and the high def is so good.  I'll actually watch that or some stupid thing on, anything with color.  Like if there's lizards on green shit, like fucking watch this.  You get like this vertigo feeling when they're doing that, uh, helicopter shot through the 
[01:17:30]  cities.  It's so true.  It feels like you're moving.  The high definition, uh, channels have absolutely nothing going on, but you'll stare at it for  hours.  Oh yeah.  You'll, you'll see a little bee on a flower.  Like it's the most amazing thing ever.  Retards staring at a pinwheel.  Pretty much.  Same effect.  Pretty much.  Uh, uh, Chris, what's going on today?  Hey, did you guys see the today show with the TV commercial that they're ripping you guys  off with the assault on the media?  What are they doing?  They, uh, it's some drug company, I, I, Ambient or Cialis or one of them.  And the guy, there's a reporter and she's doing a story and he walks up with a white t-shirt 
[01:18:00]  with the drug company, with the drug on the t-shirt.  And then the cameraman moves a little bit and then he moves to the other side and then  they move around.  So it looks like their, uh, their advertising now is, uh, picking up on what you guys are  doing.  Ah, look at that.  Oh, wow.  Losing the assault on the media.  And the advertising industry picked up on the whole wow thing when that became hot.  Wow.  Every product had wow in it.  Wow.  Wow.  Well, now we're sounding like hoo-hoo. 
[01:18:30]  Robin.  Hey, Jimmy, you killed the other day on, uh, Leno.  Oh, thanks, man.  I appreciate it.  Without a doubt, he did.  All right, man.  You ever see Leno on HDTV?  No.  They have, like, there's, um, with Time Warner, at least, it goes up to, like, a thousand channels.  But 704, I think, to 730 or whatever they are, 702, there's, like, 26 pure HD channels.  And Leno's on one of them, on the 704, and the, because his set is very colorful, and  when you, it is fucking mind-boggling how good that looks in HDTV.  Yeah.  I never would have spent that much on a TV, but my, you know, getting a couple friends 
[01:19:00]  help you out.  Right.  That's right.  Maybe get a TV for cost.  You keep that simple man image going.  You're a fancy man who needs a fancy television.  Oh, no, no, no.  You don't understand.  I'm what you call highfalutin'.  Highfalutin'.  I'm a big shot.  I just couldn't have afforded the TV.  They help me out.  And thanks to my new DVR, I saw Jay Leno in his monologue this morning as I was showering  and drinking a little coffee in my apartment.  And I got to tell you, I watched Leno again and Letterman again.  And you were right the whole time. 
[01:19:30]  I've said it now a few times.  Leno, all topical, current event-type jokes that are really funny.  Then I watched Letterman right after, and he's doing a joke about a rat and, I don't know,  like tasing a rat or something.  Oh, the cops had to tase a rat.  I don't know.  It was just like, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  That's pretty funny, though, because, you know, when you do a joke, let me just let people  break the fourth wall here.  You don't want anyone to be offended ever by it. 
[01:20:00]  Right, right.  No victim.  That keeps everyone happy.  Hey, Leno helped us out.  He did four mentions the other day when Jimmy Norton was on.  So why don't we help him out?  We got a little Leno in his monologue from last night.  Right.  We'll do this until they tell us to stop doing this.  We'll go to break with this.  Leno from last night.  Last night was the Clinton's 30th wedding anniversary.  How about that?  Very nice.  You got it.  Very nice.  I was thinking about it.  You know what keeps these two together?  Spite. 
[01:20:30]  Yesterday, President Bush and the First Lady are on the Today Show building a house for  Katrina victims.  And before construction, they gave President Bush a set of plans.  And of course, he asked if he could keep them.  Because as you know, Bush has never had a set of plans.  So this is the third time to actually have a plan.  Well, I tell you, you know who was furious?  Yeah.  When Dick Cheney saw him building the house, Cheney was furious.  He said, hey, you're taking jobs away from Halliburton.  Come on.  What are you doing?  You know, but President Bush softening up, taking more liberal positions for against, like 
[01:21:00]  global warming.  Remember, it used to be against global warming.  Well, now it's the Republican plan for heating homes this winter.  That's the new plan.  And the Supreme Court ruled this week that a witch, a witch in Chesterfield County, Virginia,  cannot say an opening prayer at government meetings.  This, of course, would be a groundbreaking decision for the year 1683.  Next month, they'll rule on trolls and leprechauns. 
[01:21:30]  And Supreme Court nominee Harriet Myers, you probably know that she told the New York Times  that George Bush was the most brilliant man she ever met, which is kind of scary.  I mean, she only has one known opinion, and that's it.  Well, here's what we know about Myers.  You know, they've been investigating her.  She's never been married, and she has no known boyfriends.  In fact, today, President Bush announced a very ambitious plan to put a man on Myers  by the year 2000.  Put a man on Myers. 
[01:22:00]  Let's see.  Oh, JetBlue.  You know JetBlue, the airlines?  How about this?  They have a new introductory fare.  Boston to New York, $25.  That's right.  I checked.  It can't be right.  $25, Boston to New York.  The reason they can offer these prices, they get rid of the frills, like front wheels, mechanics,  all is done.  No, the headset, $400.  $400. 
[01:22:30]  Hey, you all watching Yankee game the other night?  That was something, man.  That was the worst beating caught on video that didn't involve the New Orleans Police Department.  That was bad, wasn't it?  The guy hadn't had a drink in 25 years.  Oh, well, we got you now.  Well, it looks like it's the White Sox versus the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.  Another game today.  See, this is a real culture class.  The city of broad shoulders versus the city of fake boobs.  You know, it's kind of hard to watch the two come together with. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, last weekend, there was a three-day sumo wrestling tournament in Las Vegas.  Twenty of the top sumo wrestlers came over here from Japan.  And, you know, people can be so rude.  Like some were heard saying, I've never seen people so fat.  And that was the sumo wrestlers talking about Americans.  They couldn't believe it.  They couldn't believe it.  Yeah, it wasn't fair.  And the government today rounded up a group of sex peddlers and perverts in their war against  indecency.  But enough about the Minnesota Vikings.  You know about this story? 
[01:23:30]  Oh, that's a great story.  You hear about this story?  Oh, yeah.  Several Minnesotas, Minnesota Vikings played in the investigative after boat crews on a  lake turned into a wild sex party on this boat.  And the coach of the Vikings got suspicious after several players complained of groin pulls  and they didn't play this week.  So they're, hey, wait a minute.  No, that's it.  Then there was on this boat.  They were having wild sex.  They were drinking.  They were pillaging.  You know, I think they're taking this Viking thing a little too far.  I think they're going to pull back.  What are they?  One in three? 
[01:24:00]  One in three.  You know, that's the only offensive thing they've done all season, actually.  And what else?  Rap star Lil' Kim was nominated for Vibe Award, but she can't be there because she's  in prison.  Here's the main thing.  In prison, she's actually surrounded by more rap stars than she would be at the Vibe Award.  Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Hey, you can make fun of the president, but don't pick on rap stars.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah?  I read in the paper today, there's an artist in China who paints with his tongue, doesn't  use a brush, uses his tongue.  And here's the amazing part, he's a house painter, that's the amazing part.  For years, Andrew has waited for that special someone, a woman to spend his life with.  I think it's very romantic, actually.  A soulmate.  Will you shut up?  Patty has never experienced love.  I have self-control all the time. 
[01:25:00]  And is a boring dipshit.  I like doing puzzles and things from the paper, like all the crossword puzzles, the math puzzles  and the post.  What if someone you couldn't stand?  You have no sexuality.  Was the only someone for you?  I think she looks very beautiful.  Witness the romance between a stammering maniac with chronic halitosis.  There's a slight breath problem.  And a cliche slinging bag lady. 
[01:25:30]  A wild and crazy evening.  No matter what she says, after she says it, I want her killed.  He has fun on the various wheel.  I was too big and it wouldn't balance both of us.  Wow.  But what happens after the love is gone?  You know, I just want to be, you know, friends.  Fuck you, bitch.  Why can't we be reading more than friends?  I can't.  I'm sorry. 
[01:26:00]  What are you doing?  No.  No.  No.  When rejection sends you over the edge, the only answer is murder.  No, why not?  Freak Date.  Freak Date.  Mumbling its way to a theater near you.  There's too many men.  Too many people.  Making too many problems. 
[01:26:30]  And there's not a cause of love to go around.  Can't you see this is a lot of confusion?  This is the world we live in.  And these are the ends we're given.  You, them, and let's start trying.  To make it a place worth living in.  That's Disturbed, Land of Confusion, the old Genesis song as we get back to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:27:00]  Great.  We're doing a very rare live appearance tomorrow, I guess, right?  Tomorrow's Friday, right?  Oh, it is tomorrow.  Tomorrow's the last day we have with Jimmy.  Goody, goody gumdrops.  We're doing something tomorrow after the show.  Oh, joy on a Friday.  Oh.  You won't hit any traffic Friday afternoon.  Friday afternoon rush hour.  It shouldn't be a problem at all in the rain.  Thank you for bringing that up. 
[01:27:30]  Might as well just get a hotel in and enjoy New York over the weekend.  What are you guys doing tomorrow?  Digital live show.  Jimmy, are you coming with us?  No one told me.  Tomorrow at the Jacob Javits Convention Center here in New York City from 1230 to 130.  We might be there a little longer than that.  We'll see.  We'll see how it goes.  Actually, it's pretty cool.  For something that we have to do that I, you know, usually flee from the city, I don't mind doing this because it's tech stuff.  And I like that.  And then we went to the Javits Center.  I'm going to go just check that place out. 
[01:28:00]  It's pretty cool.  It's definitely cool.  And we'll be there from 1230 to 130 signing our awful publicity photos.  No, actually, we like this version, right?  Yeah.  We like this one.  All right.  So that's going on tomorrow.  I wonder if Pat from Munaki is showing up like he did last year to just lean on the counter that we're signing for the entire time we're there yapping.  He's not going to be there.  He's a big star now.  Now that Regis is talking about him.  God, all our like, like our, what do we call these people?  Creeps.  Yeah.  We used to have a name from our, what was the name we used to use? 
[01:28:30]  Cancers.  Freaks.  Hangers on them.  The freaks of the show or whatever.  Yeah.  Stalker Patty, if you're just tuning in, is going to be on Maury Povich.  We gave Maury a pretty good idea when he was in here.  He went with it.  And he's doing a show on like old virgins.  Obviously, we got it from the movie and we're not, you know, we're not going to, you know, whatever.  But, but Stalker Patty's 50 years old and a virgin.  So Maury said, yeah, we'll do a show with her.  And they gave her a makeover and stuff. 
[01:29:00]  Patty should be in here in about 20 minutes to talk about her experience on Maury Povich.  We don't know when that show's going to air yet.  And then Pat from Anarchy, another one of our freaks, he was in an eating contest, a grilled cheese eating contest.  They're eating shit every day all over the country, these professional leaders.  It's not all about the hot dogs.  They eat something different every weekend, I guess.  Steve, instant feedback's down.  Uh-oh.  Instant feedback's down, Steve.  Get on it.  Steve.  Get on it.  Get on the horn. 
[01:29:30]  Where is that incompetent?  And, uh, here comes Steve.  I don't know what happened to the internet.  So I dripped honey in the controls.  Big creep.  He really is.  Big stupid claws.  Bee landed on my nose and frightened me.  When are you going to punch somebody?  I can't.  I've been waiting years for this.  I know you have.  And I'm sure I'll get mad enough one day to hit somebody really hard.  But it just doesn't happen yet.  One day.  Boy, you don't want it to be you, man. 
[01:30:00]  No, I know that.  I can't, dude.  I've fucked somebody up really bad a couple times.  You know what's going to happen?  He'll start, like, speaking Lebanese.  You know, that's going to start coming out when he gets angry.  The language of his homeland.  You usually end up hurting somebody real bad.  Look at him with his big Lebanese arms.  Yeah.  When Steve snaps, it's going to be...  It'll be ugly.  It'll be ugly and I'll get locked up.  Yeah, it'll be a jail sentence.  Yeah.  He probably pisses his pants.  He gets so mad he blacks out and urinates in himself.  He doesn't mean to.  Why is...  Boy, Bubby's mom is on the bed. 
[01:30:30]  What is going on with the G-Rock radio show?  I was just looking at the camera there and apparently there's a big fat woman on the  Rockaway bed wearing this pink jacket.  Some kind of photo op.  And slacks.  And sensible shoes.  People are going to get their picture taken.  They sit on the end of the bed and they have their photo taken.  This is awful.  Wow.  That's some kind of photo op.  She absolutely looks like bad boy Bubby's mom.  Oh, yeah.  This is kind of comfy, you know.  Oh, you're a good boy. 
[01:31:00]  He's only using one hand.  All right.  Anyway, Papramanaki was mentioned on Regis and Kelly yesterday morning.  Well, maybe this will, let's say to wrap this up, 19 grilled cheese sandwiches in 10 minutes.  I'll read by those.  Is it possible for somebody to eat and swallow 19 of these grilled babies in 10 minutes?  Well, yes, it is.  And the guy who did it won the grilled cheese eating contest.  Is he a relative of you? 
[01:31:30]  Oh, no.  No, no, no, the runner-up, Patrick Philbin from Menachie, Menachie, New Jersey, right across the ribbon.  Scarfed down a sandwich and a half less.  And third place came in too close to call.  Wait.  Patrick Philbin from Menachie.  Menachie.  I've actually shoved 19 grilled cheese sandwiches in my nose.  Why does Regis always sound like he's got the bird flu?  I don't know.  He just, his nose is just a mess.  He is just not there anymore. 
[01:32:00]  I've lost my budachi.  He's been living in New York for 60 years.  He can't get anything right.  He cannot get anything right that he talks about.  Budachi.  Listen again.  Well, maybe this will, let's take your appetite.  19 grilled cheese sandwiches in 10 minutes.  Is it possible for somebody to eat and swallow 19 of these grilled babies in 10 minutes?  Well, yes, it is.  And the guy who did it won the grilled cheese eating contest. 
[01:32:30]  Is he a relative of you?  Oh, no.  No, no.  It's a runner-up.  The runner-up, Patrick Philbin from Menachie.  Menachie, New Jersey, right across the ribbon.  Scarfed down a sandwich and a half less.  And third place came in too close to call.  Yes, I shared some grilled cheese.  The other day, it was at a fine restaurant here in Manhattan with Steve Lawrence and Edie Gourmet.  And we...  Shut up!  Menachie.  He is so out of touch with anything relevant. 
[01:33:00]  Menachie's like right over the river, basically.  Menachie.  I can understand maybe some obscure town way in South Jersey.  Yeah.  But he could pretty much look at Menachie from his apartment.  Menachie.  That's his last name, Philbin?  Yeah.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  Pat from Menachie.  Menachie.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Pat?  Oh, not much.  Have a little grilled cheese for breakfast.  Congratulations on the mention on Regis and Kelly yesterday morning. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, thank you.  Well, Pat, you have taken this eating thing very seriously.  We thought it was just a lark, something for you to maybe get the name of the show on TV or something.  But you are now really becoming a contender.  I'm ranked 15th in the world.  He's 15th in the world.  And what is the organization?  Nambla?  What is it?  No, that's the other one I've logged in.  The IFOCE, the International Federation of Competitive Eating. 
[01:34:00]  Competitive Eating.  And you're ranked 15th in the world.  And now, how many of these do you do a month, would you say?  I think over the course of the year, it averages maybe once a month.  Maybe once a month.  So 12 a year.  There's a picture of him on the IFOCE website.  Wow.  There you are.  You know why he's 15th?  Because there's only 20 of them because they die at a rate of about six a day.  A bunch of fatsoes just tipping over. 
[01:34:30]  Now, you ate in the grilled cheese eating competition.  Yeah.  Who came in first?  That was Ed Cookie Jarvis from Long Island.  Ed Cookie Jarvis.  And how far behind were you?  He ended up with 19 and I had 17 and a half.  Wow.  So close.  I thought he'd abolish me, but I kept it close.  So close.  He's ranked number fourth in the world.  Fourth in the world. 
[01:35:00]  Yes.  And you almost had him.  Almost.  Wow.  And where was this?  In Arkansas?  Little Rock, Arkansas.  Little Rock, Arkansas.  So you're traveling everywhere for this.  Yeah.  I got to see Grand Funk Railroad the night before.  That was cool.  Wow.  That was cool.  What a life.  Grand Funk Railroad and then a bunch of grilled cheese sandwiches.  Oh, God.  You really should pray for a drunk driving accident, Pat.  You should enter our take a picture of your dump contest after some grilled cheese.  That's right. 
[01:35:30]  17 and a half grilled cheese sandwiches.  You want to accept a picture from him for the contest?  From Pat, of course.  By the way, I don't think I'm going to have a picture in time.  No.  Yeah, that grilled cheese is going to take like a week to come out.  It's all dairy, too.  It'll be like a wet pile, like a close-up of an ice cream cone.  It's going to look like the Doomsday device from Star Trek.  We're talking to the guy that invented the car crash, by the way.  Let's not forget, the car crash all started with Pat from... 
[01:36:00]  Pat from Budachi.  Mudachi.  Budachi.  No, it's no relation to the Philbids, my Philbids.  No relation, huh, Pat?  Wow, that would have been kind of cool.  Actually, I've never seen a picture of my father, so it could be.  You never know.  Why haven't you seen a picture of your father?  Uh-oh.  Well, my sister tells me he didn't like taking pictures, but he was out of there real soon. 
[01:36:30]  Probably after he saw me.  Oh, your father left after you were born?  How old were you?  Probably like six months.  Six months old and your father leaves.  Yeah.  That's why you're swallowing a lot of aggression.  Along with a lot of grilled cheese sandwiches.  Hey, what's the next contest?  You're entering in.  Yeah.  Dewey Oxberger from Mudachi.  October, I believe it's 28th, it's going to be the Verizon Voice Wing Challenge. 
[01:37:00]  And what is that?  It's basically hot wings.  It's got to be down in D.C.  Hot wings.  Now, that's got to be difficult because of the bones.  Well, you don't eat the bones there, Anthony.  Well, if it's hot wings, I guess they, what, they use chicken nuggets?  There's a lot of coordination going on.  You've got to strip the meat off the bone.  Well, that's what I mean, not eating the bone, you ninny.  I mean the fact that you can't just shove the thing in your mouth.  And how do they judge if a bone has been cleaned off good enough? 
[01:37:30]  Well, some contests judge differently, but this one is the proper way to judge it.  They go by weight.  They weigh the wings beforehand, and then they weigh the bones afterwards.  Oh, so they figure out the difference.  So they won't know, like, right when it's over, who wins.  Yeah, other contests they judge by if you have to clean every bone, and then they count the wings,  which is not good because some people clean the bone better.  Right. 
[01:38:00]  Right, okay.  Ooh, they weigh it.  How about that?  Well, very excited.  So this one, the strategy for this one, you just rip off most of the meat,  because the more chewing you take, you're taking too much time.  Well, you don't want to take up time nibbling little nibbles off of the little bone.  Correct.  Very good, Pat.  Well, good luck to you.  All right, good luck to you, Pat from Budachi.  We'll be looking forward to watching you in this eating competition.  I'll see you Friday, Ant.  We'll talk about Warner Brothers cartoons.  Oh, you're going to show up and lean on the counter again? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Annoying pest.  You're going to be making an appearance with us at the Digital Life Show  at the Jacob Javits Convention Center, 1230 to 130 tomorrow.  Annoying.  That's correct.  The unofficial WOW van will be there.  Great.  All right, are you going to the Halloween party?  Of course.  I bought three shirts.  It's got my frigging name on it.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we're giving out shirts to pretty much everyone that goes to our Halloween party.  My brother came up with a great design.  Yes.  Celebrating a year on XM.  He's got a lot of the things that we've done on the back of the shirt. 
[01:39:00]  It's really cool.  You can see the design on openinganthony.com, and if you can't make the party, you can buy  them, I guess.  And they go up to 3X.  Some people just think it's just one X.  Oh, they go up to 3X.  Yeah.  You can buy the shirt.  So I can buy a shirt.  Yeah.  The shirts we're going to give out at the Halloween party.  Are you going to go as anyone, Pat?  Me, myself, and I.  Meh.  You should go as Bad Boy Bubby's mom.  Bad Boy Bubby's mom?  Someone has to go as Bad Boy Bubby's mom. 
[01:39:30]  I was going to go as Ralph Crandon's man from space.  Ah, that would win.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  All right, Pat.  Good luck to you with the eating thing, and we'll see you tomorrow, all right?  Thank you very much.  There he goes.  Pat from Munaki.  Munaki.  Munaki.  Munaki.  All right.  Wonderful.  Uh-oh.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Jimmy, what's wrong?  Something seems to have struck his funny bone.  Jimmy?  Jimmy, what's wrong, Jimmy? 
[01:40:00]  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Something's just got him laughing.  I can't figure out what it could be.  I'm reading the funny papers.  Oh, of course.  Jimmy's reading the funny papers.  Dude, this one is good.  Reading the funny papers.  Marma Duke.  Marma Duke.  Oh, he's running, right?  He's dragging the guy behind him really fast. 
[01:40:30]  He's running.  And the guy goes, don't you want to stay low mileage?  Yeah, that one's a hoot all night.  Oh, wow.  What a knee slapper.  That's terrific. 
[01:41:00]  That's terrific.  And then there's Dilbert.  He's sitting there.  He's like a computer screen.  And behind him.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  Dilbert's at a...  He's a computer screen.  Okay, and somebody's behind him?  Let me get through this.  Please don't make me laugh.  All right.  And she's standing behind him and she goes, I took the liberty of calculating how rich you'd  have to be.  And then the next thing she's reading, before I'd be willing to date you, the number is 
[01:41:30]  four trillion dollars.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  That doesn't end there.  That's just a laugh in the middle of the strip.  Wow.  I'm getting lightheaded.  Two laughs.  In the next one, Dilbert goes, you're happily married.  And she goes, that's all factored in.  Oh, come on.  I thought it was over in caption two, too.  That looked like, oh, my God, there's more. 
[01:42:00]  To get two laughs like that on a comic strip.  Wow.  Oh, dude, I have a headache.  Beetle Bailey.  So do I.  Beetle Bailey.  Always a chuckle from Beetle Bailey.  Always.  The Sarge is eating.  And there's the cook and there's Beetle at the table.  The cook?  What do they use?  Some ink?  The Sarge goes, he's looking close at his breakfast.  Why do waffles have these little indentations? 
[01:42:30]  And the cook goes, so the syrup can't escape.  And in the next caption, the Sarge looks confused.  He goes, I don't understand.  And Beetle goes, nothing edible has ever escaped Sarge.  Ah, see, because he's a big guy, right?  Ah! 
[01:43:00]  Wow.  Oh, wait.  That is funny.  Here's the boondocks.  Boondocks?  Yeah.  It's the cartoon for the...  The boondocks?  Yeah.  Isn't that the first panel is, hey, Leroy, park the boat?  Yeah.  You know, you're not that far off, man.  It's an African-American gentleman. 
[01:43:30]  And he says, they didn't blow up the levees to kick out all the black people.  And the other black person goes, yes, they did.  And the other guy goes, the world's...  And the next caption, he goes, the world's trade center wasn't blown up from within.  And the little conspiracy black guy goes, yes, it was.  And the next one, it goes, Prophet Yawa cannot summon UFOs on command.  And then the other black guy, conspiracy guy goes, yes, he can. 
[01:44:00]  And then he goes...  Oh, no.  Hold on.  I don't see a fourth box here.  There is only...  Wait a minute.  There's only one, two, three boxes.  But the next one...  There is no... 
[01:44:30]  He says, little girl, you're kin to me.  And she says, no, I'm not.  No, no, no.  I didn't get that.  What are you...  There was no fourth...  Where the...  Ah.  I'm no kin to the monkey, no, no, no.  The monkey's no kin to me, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know much about his ancestors, but mine didn't swing by my tree. 
[01:45:00]  It seems so unbelievable.  And yet they're saying it's true.  True.  They're teaching us the violence for now.  That humans were monkeys once too.  Whoa.  Oh, I'm no kin to the monkey, no, no, no.  The monkey's no kin to me, yeah, yeah, yeah.  By the way, this will stick in your head like no other song we've ever played.  I was singing that around the house yesterday all day and all night long. 
[01:45:30]  And this morning when I got up.  You just start humming it, right?  No, no, no, no.  I'm no kin to...  And you just find yourself...  No, no, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  More addicting than...  You just can't get it out of your head.  More addicting than...  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Yep.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  That is catchy, but that I'm no kin to a monkey thing?  Yeah.  Because the...  Marmaduke ain't doing it for me.  Kids just sound adorable in it, don't they? 
[01:46:00]  What, sir?  What, Chuck?  I said Marmaduke ain't doing it for me.  I don't know.  The last...  The whole part of the fucking...  The reading the comics, you're just cracking up there in the middle of it.  It was fucking it all up.  Me and my brother were sitting here.  I was like, I'm waiting to laugh.  And it's like, where the fuck's the punchline?  And I didn't find any of it funny.  I'm sorry.  You didn't like the Marmaduke cartoon?  You cannot be this stupid, Chuck.  Where are you from?  Come on.  Where are you from?  Milltown.  Sure?  Milltown.  New Jersey?  I don't know.  The last...  Yeah. 
[01:46:30]  You didn't like the Marmaduke cartoon?  Wait.  No, I didn't like...  Turn your radio down or you fail.  Turn your fucking radio down!  Sorry, that was my fucking brother.  You can listen to yourself on the replay later today.  No, I know that.  Holy shit.  Just figure out what time you're on the radio and then do the math and listen to yourself  later.  Right.  Now, you didn't find it funny.  I really got to get into this.  You didn't find it funny because you wanted Jimmy to say it clearly so you could laugh at  the comic. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, I think it was more just along the fucking thing.  He was cracking up there in the whole fucking thing.  It just...  It fucked me up for it.  It ruined the comic for you?  It ruined the punchline of the comic so you wanted to laugh at the comic strip?  Yeah, I was looking...  Dude, I thought it was going to be funny.  I thought the next thing was going to be funny.  Oh my God, I'm embarrassed for you.  Right.  Wait.  New Jersey listeners, I got to tell you.  I got to stick up for New Jersey.  They get the humor of this show.  Yeah.  I thought you were from Alabama, Chuck.  You poor guy.  Because they're still trying to figure it all out.  They're trying to figure out our humor. 
[01:47:30]  Chuck, the Beatle Bailey one did you like?  I didn't catch the entire one.  Oh, see, because Jimmy...  Because you were laughing through it.  If you would just read the goddamn comic, Jimmy, then these people would be able to hear  it and appreciate it.  If you could read it without laughing...  Right, without laughing.  Wait, hold on.  All right, dude.  Hold on.  I mean, find one.  Holy shit.  What comic do you like, Chuck?  Garfield.  Garfield is very funny.  Let me see.  Okay.  I don't know.  All right.  Wait, let me see if he's here.  I hate to take people out of the bit, but that's what the fuck he's doing. 
[01:48:00]  Holy shit.  You cannot be this stupid.  This gentleman wants to hear the comic that Jimmy's reading, not Jimmy's laughing.  I couldn't get through it without laughing.  Dude, could you read these without laughing?  Yes, sir.  You know, it's not Jimmy's fault that they're so hysterical that he can't stop laughing.  It's not that fucking hysterical.  I mean, it's just funny.  Holy shit.  Dude, the comics make me laugh.  Holy shit.  Why do we even bother doing a radio show?  Not that funny. 
[01:48:30]  Not that funny.  Wait, Chuck.  Gentlemen, I just don't find the comics that funny.  Chuck, have you read today's Blondie?  Nah.  Blondie.  How am I...  I'm going to read it straight.  Try it, Jimmy.  For this guy's sake, please try to get through it with...  I know they're funny, and Dagwood's hysterical, but just try.  Try to get through it.  Dagwood and his co-worker are walking, right?  Uh-huh.  And the neighbor.  All right.  All right, wait.  They're walking. 
[01:49:00]  They're getting out of a car, and the neighbor says...  Hold on.  Tootsie is visiting her Aunt Velma tonight, so I'm on my own.  And then Dagwood says, why don't you come over around 7 and have dinner with us?  And the next panel, they're standing there holding their briefcases, and the neighbor  goes to Dagwood.  That's very thoughtful of you, Dag, and I accept.  Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I apologize, Chuck. 
[01:49:30]  Is that where I'm supposed to be cracking up with him?  Dude, no.  No, no, no, because it's not over yet.  See, he's reading the last panel, and it's making him laugh so much that it's very hard  for him to get through with this.  I do.  Because he appreciates good humor.  Right.  In the last one, they're still talking.  But I've got to go and punch it out.  I've got to get to fucking work before somebody kills me.  Let me finish this one.  All right, come on.  Finish it up.  There's...  There's...  There's a last panel, and the guy goes, but let's make it six. 
[01:50:00]  And I don't like selfish.  And no chicken.  I had that last night.  And then Dagwood says, Chuck is a stupid cunt.  Hey, who do you call a stupid cunt?  Hey, I need a wild sticker, man.  I got some fat core, aren't we, over here?  Fucking Amboy.  Not an Amboy.  We're in Amboy.  Pathmark and Amboy today.  Come on, get a wild fan out here.  All right.  Bye, Chuck.  You stupid son of a bitch.  Oh, my God.  What a mox.  What an ass. 
[01:50:30]  Complete idiot.  Look, and now we've got Alabama defending themselves, and they should.  Chris, go ahead.  Yeah, I'm from Alabama.  I just want to say, big fat fuck you.  We kind of get the show down here, buddy.  You get the show, right?  Fuck yeah.  Do you get the, I hate to take, I hate to tear down the ninth wall here, but you get what  Jimmy's doing with this bit?  Well, I was on the wall for a while, because I wasn't hearing it.  All right.  But yeah, I get the fucking show.  We laugh about it down here.  All right.  We get off.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[01:51:00]  I hate to tear down that wall, but, you know.  That was a wall.  Sometimes you have to.  It was a piece of paper mache.  I didn't think that needed to be torn down.  No, shit.  No one knew that.  Tim from Alabama.  Hey, y'all need to calm down in Alabama.  We ain't all a bunch of dumbasses down here now.  We're smarter than fucking idiots in New Jersey.  You're right.  Alabama, wow.  Now, Tim.  Do you understand?  We rarely do this, but let me ask you a question.  Do you understand what Jim Norton is doing with the comics bit?  Yeah, it's ironic humor. 
[01:51:30]  Alabama, wow.  Wow.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  We got to lay off Alabama.  They're pretty smart.  Hey, there's a part of Alabama that is called North Alabama, where all the defense and aerospace  industries are.  That's where all the intelligent people are.  The people that call you are truck drivers from Central or L.A., Lower Alabama.  Uh-huh.  They're about as dumb as a brick.  All right.  So, not all of us are stupid.  All right.  Wow, we got a lot of fans in Alabama.  Here's TJ. 
[01:52:00]  TJ.  What's up, Opie?  What's up, TJ?  Alabama gets misrepresented by some of the dumbasses that live down here and call in  the radio shows.  Yeah.  But it goes to show every state's got their dumbasses.  Can I get a real eagle?  It would have been better if he could have hung up quick, but he had, like, fumbled the  phone.  Fumble, fumble, fumble, fumble.  Oh, that's great.  TJ.  Yeah.  And he's still there.  Yeah, and he's still there waiting.  Very good.  You understand the Jim Norton comic bit, right? 
[01:52:30]  I love Jim Norton.  I actually call him to the comedy show almost once a week to request Jim Norton.  Thank you, sir.  All right, but do you understand the comic bit he just did?  Yeah.  All right.  It's not really hilarious, but he's making it funny just to piss off that dumbass Chuck.  There you go.  See?  Jesus.  I can't believe we had to explain that one.  Thank you.  We don't like explaining our things.  No.  We just assume everyone gets it.  You got to understand irony, sarcasm sometimes.  Evilness.  Evilness. 
[01:53:00]  I want to grab Chuck.  This is a studio reference.  Uh-huh.  The way Wings Hauser grabbed Nina Blackwood and Vice Squad.  And I just want to say-  Wow!  I cannot believe how stupid you are.  Wings Hauser and Nina Blackwood, yeah.  You ain't gonna beat me, Ramrod?  Ramrod.  That was it.  I cannot believe-  Holy shit.  How stupid you are.  I want to change gears here.  You know we have this wow line now?  We have an F.U. line.  It's great.  Uh-huh.  It's so good.  So many radio shows across America now enjoy that bit on their own shows. 
[01:53:30]  Of course.  Hoo-hoo.  But it is the truth.  It started with us, the whole F.U. line thing.  Okay.  So we decided to do the wow line.  Uh-huh.  You know, that's good marketing, right?  Yeah.  You see this all the time in the real world.  One thing works, so then you want to capitalize and come up with two things.  Right.  You kind of-  It's almost like a spin-off or, you know, this works, so this will work.  Right.  Now we'll have two more gooder things.  Two good things. 
[01:54:00]  Instead of just one.  Instead of one good thing.  So we have this wow line.  What is the number, by the way?  Uh-oh.  Where's my sheet?  It's, uh, if you see boobs because you've got a wow sticker on your car, you're supposed  to share with the rest of the country through our fine radio show, and you call 1-866-WOW-ME-05.  Yeah.  Okay?  Or 0-5, right?  Zero.  Yeah.  0-5.  Okay?  1-866-WOW-ME-05.  Well, the wow line's up and running.  Oh, boy.  And we got this call.  I just got wowed on I-95 in Virginia. 
[01:54:30]  It's Saturday morning.  This guy just whipped his beautiful cock out and showed me.  It was awesome.  I gotta say, I didn't see that coming.  This is a giant cock.  I did not see that one coming.  It's not whip it out Wednesday.  It's, it's wow.  Whip them out. 
[01:55:00]  Or whip, whip um out.  Whip um, whip um out.  Whip him out.  Oh, my God.  Whip him out.  I'm distracted because Stalker Patty's here.  Do not show us Stalker Patty.  Oh, no, not yet.  I could tell by Ben.  I could tell by Ben that this is going to be unbelievable.  Ben is laughing hysterically outside the window as I'm trying to, like, explain this wow thing.  Maury Povich gave her a makeover yesterday.  She's coming in to talk about her experience on the Maury Povich show.  And I guess she's dressed as they had her dressed yesterday.  And Ben is laughing hysterically. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Ben, hide her in Ron and Fez's office.  I'm telling you, because we're going to go take leaks here.  And I don't want to see her until we go live after the commercial.  Ben is laughing hysterically.  You know what that means.  The mail must have come.  Well, this coming in on instant feedback.  This page cannot be displayed.  Isn't that great?  What?  The page you're looking for is currently unavailable.  Oh, we still don't have instant feedback.  This in on instant feedback.  The website may be experiencing technical difficulties, or you may need to adjust your browser settings. 
[01:56:00]  I don't think that's the feedback.  We're working on it.  We're working on it.  I'm waiting for Scott to call me back.  Scott?  Who's Scott?  Scott is the guy that...  My brother?  No.  My brother's involved with the show?  Yes, exactly.  Scott Peterson.  He had a lot of time, so he learned programming and made our instant feedback.  Scott's the guy that...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Notice I couldn't commit to the really obnoxious laugh with this monster in front of me.  Do you like your blackberry teeth? 
[01:56:30]  I don't care.  I didn't use to it.  Ah, motherfucker.  I'll just stab you with the fucking scissors, I swear to God.  Just use your claws.  I know.  We're working on it.  But you're like Fonzie.  You know that, right?  Hey.  Anthony brought this bit to the show years ago.  You're like Fonzie.  You're always threatening and saying what you want to do, but you never do anything.  Never saw him beat up anybody.  Because I'm smart enough to know that it's not worth hitting anybody.  It really isn't.  Richie should have just punched Fonzie in the middle of the forehead.  Hey.  Fonzie was never going to get in my office.  Because you realize at a certain age that you start clubbing people really hard, you're 
[01:57:00]  going to go to jail.  And it's not worth it.  It really isn't.  But you can't threaten anymore because no one's buying it.  You're like the boy that cried...  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where?  Or that.  Or that.  Or that.  What did that mean?  That's the little boy who cried fire.  And then the fireman would show up and they'd sing, where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where?  But it's just a rip-off hoo-hoo of the original Boy That Cried Wolf.  You know.  You're right. 
[01:57:30]  Cried wolf, wolf, wolf.  And then all the townspeople would come, try to save him, and I realized the kid would  start laughing.  Right.  And then one day the wolf came and the townspeople didn't when he cried wolf and the wolf ate  the child.  There's a fire on my sheets.  There's a fire on my feet.  Oh, doesn't anyone care?  Football.  Football.  So some guy named Scott is working on the NCAA back.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  I'll tell Scott he's doing a shit job because it's still not up there.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's only gone down like maybe three times in a fucking year.  That's exactly what I'm trying to say. 
[01:58:00]  Good point, Steve.  Chuck in Jersey.  Runs on hybrid fuel, the servers.  Chuck?  Yo.  What's up, Chuck?  Hey.  I'm a very confused person here.  You know, I was baffled by the comic thing, but in the beginning of the show, it says you  guys hate each other.  And then talk.  I mean, would it really need a fire hose to be cleaned?  Oh, I get it.  This guy is imitating Chuck from Jersey.  All right.  Chuck, very good.  Very good.  Very good.  I thought it was the Chuck from Jersey, but it's just a guy imitating the stupidness of 
[01:58:30]  Chuck from Jersey.  Imagine if we didn't get his ironic call.  What a full circle we would have come.  Yep.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you.  Chuck is a stupid face.  By the way, so I guess the point we're making here, we're looking for wow sightings, not  cock sightings.  We're looking for girls that are showing their beautiful breasts to you, the truckers and  the businessmen and whoever the fuck you are out there.  Right.  Big areolas, maybe.  Don't you love that?  If you're seeing cock on the highway, keep it to yourself.  Please.  Let's not whip it out Wednesday. 
[01:59:00]  Keep it under your hat.  I think that's what I was trying to say.  That's right.  We want to hear about the luscious cans that you're seeing out there.  Called G-Rock Radio for your cock sightings.  All right.  Let's see what the F.U. line's doing today.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Fuck the Yankees and the Red Sox.  As a big F.U. goes out to all the Yankee fans.  Fuck you.  Your fucking team sucks.  Yeah, I got a big fuck you for New York City.  The town that never fucking sleeps and you can't find any fucking apple cake for Anthony 
[01:59:30]  the whiner.  Jesus Christ, somebody bake a fucking apple cake and shove it in the ass with a quick fiction  about it.  I just want to send a big F.U. to Gutter King.  You fucking suck, Joe.  Your fucking products suck.  You stink.  Hey, how you doing?  This is Rich from Philly.  I just want to give a big fuck you to the Boston Red Sox fans and the fucking team. 
[02:00:00]  Fuck you guys.  You guys suck.  You got taken down by a fucking team that hasn't won a goddamn series in fucking what?  Almost 84 years?  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Yeah, White Sox.  Beat the Red Sox.  You guys fucking suck.  Another fucking 86 years, you assholes.  Ha ha ha ha.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE1. 
[02:00:30]  1-866-FU-LINE1.  Well, fuck you very much.  The O.P. and Anthony F.U.  Get infected.  Then we just saw Dice doing earthquake coverage.  Earthquake coverage.  On Fox News.  Hey, Fox News.  I'm working for Fox now.  It's more of a visual, I understand, but the reporter looked just like Dice and Anthony went off.  Oh, my gosh.  I was over at the comedy club, but Fox, I'm over here now. 
[02:01:00]  I'm over here now doing the earthquake coverage.  Weren't you running the gym for a while?  Yeah.  I was at a gym.  I was running the gym.  Then the comedy.  But I'm over here now on Fox News.  There was, I don't know, something shook.  Something fell on some poor bastards.  And now some dark people are trying to dig each other out.  Back to you.  In the studio over there. 
[02:01:30]  Cause I'm over here.  I would watch that every night, actually.  Wouldn't you watch it?  The guy, I don't know what the reporter's name is.  That's why I'm all over the country for the latest disaster.  But if that guy didn't look exactly like Dice doing the friggin' news from earthquake-riddled Afghanistan.  He just needed a bedazzled jacket.  I got my jacket on.  And look, I'll turn around and show people.  It'll cheer him up.  I'll do some jokes.  Over here.  Hey, hey, you in a rubble. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, hey.  Hey, over here now.  Pay attention.  So I'm on the line at the bank.  And I got my tongue up.  This cheat says, oh!  Hey, what are you, dying on me?  Wake up, you ain't hard cheat.  Wake up.  What's with Chinese people driving?  You could blindfold him with dental floss.  Oh!  Hey, pull the rock on him.  He's enjoying himself.  Just pull the rock off him so he could see me. 
[02:02:30]  Hickory dickory dog.  That child got crushed by a rock.  Oh!  or a rock.  Open everything.  Yeah, sensual creep.  Is that a 정부?  Is that a-I mean he'll prove that I-I ya know I sincerely know I.  Is that a goodbye? 
[02:03:00]  That I can get who and my you are.  And be here, and be here  Why are you holding your dick?  He likes this song.  A lot.  Hi, Mitch.  You like this song, Bubby?  Bad boy, Bubby.  Where's my bad boy, Bubby?  Where's Anthony's bad boy, Bubby?  Where is it?  Bad boy, Jimmy.  I want it here because you know me.  I sprint out of here so quickly at 11. 
[02:03:30]  Listen, Steve has to be holding it like the people hold water for marathon runners  on the way to the elevator so I can grab it and leave.  Are we watching Bad Boy, Bubby tonight for a full review tomorrow?  Tonight, the second I get home, it goes in the DVD player.  Somehow I'm going to watch it as well, and we'll have a full report tomorrow on the program.  Very good.  Lindsay can take one.  She understands, right?  She'll sit and watch, right?  I don't know. 
[02:04:00]  She was the one that had the problem with it last night.  Maybe she was just mad at the erection she saw forming in your pants.  Oh, here it is.  Bad boy, Bubby.  Is there another one?  I think Steve might have gotten one for you.  Oh, Steve's a good boy.  That's the reason that mine wasn't in the studio for the past couple of hours.  Everyone will have a copy of Bad Boy, Bubby.  Oh, is Steve burning them again?  Okay, good.  Poor motherfucker's probably eating dirt in Australia somewhere.  Can't even throw him a couple of bucks. 
[02:04:30]  No, actually, someone ran out and got copies.  And I bought it.  Oh, right.  We found a little DVD shop.  Australian DVD shop down the road.  Yeah, a little place on 49th Street and where?  Madison.  Yeah, that's where it was.  Right.  Sometimes he'll say things like, hey, whatever you want, I can get.  I'll burn them and sell them.  Yeah.  I have a big gym bag on the corner.  I think he said shut the fuck.  Yeah.  He just makes his eyes look Chinese and he gets away with it. 
[02:05:00]  So he's fine.  No one knows it's actually him.  Have you seen this movie Bad Boy, Bubby?  It's a wonderful motion picture.  It's a love between a mother and a son.  It's wonderful.  Fantastic.  Bubby from Munaki.  Bubby from Munachi.  You know, it reminds me of when I sat and talked with Joan Crawford once many years ago.  Shut up.  You know, I met Groucho Marx and Anthony Kubia on the same day from Munachi.  Let's say hi to Larry in New Mexico. 
[02:05:30]  Larry?  Larry.  Hey, I just wanted to tell you, there ain't nobody that makes me laugh more on this fucking earth than Jimmy.  Larry!  That's it.  Jim Norton?  Thank you.  Wasn't he great on fucking Leno the other night?  He was unbelievable.  Thank you, Larry.  Unbelievable.  And he cute as a button.  He knocked it out of the ballpark.  Right.  I'll tell you what, I get more out of him, listen to him on the radio, but God, I can't  wait until the 21st to watch him on HBO.  There you go, HBO.  Jim Norton's half-hour comedy special.  Wow, this guy's good.  Very good.  What a fat pig I look like. 
[02:06:00]  Jimmy, there's a good blowjob for you this morning, buddy.  Thank you, buddy.  He slobbered on it.  You're a good boy, Larry.  Well, I guess this would be a good time to get into the Jim Norton-Bill Burr campaign  that's been going on secretly behind the scenes.  I didn't know that they were running for the office of the seat.  That's right.  And then the campaign has turned as ugly as the New Jersey campaign.  That's right.  And before we start, because we realize there's a lot of dummies out there that listen to this  program, and they're going to start rumors if they hear something differently here. 
[02:06:30]  That's Jim Norton's seat.  That's right.  That's Jim Norton's seat until he tells us to go fuck ourselves and goes to Hollywood full-time.  Or until Bill comes back into town.  Well, Bill will be here Monday.  All right.  But let's not mistake anything here.  It's Jim Norton.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  It's Jim Norton.  Bill Burr becoming huge as far as his show goes.  And we need to do that, because we lost a lot of our comedian friends in our time off.  They could all go fuck themselves, quite frankly. 
[02:07:00]  Wow.  And Bill Burr is stepping in and filling that void quite nicely.  We have a comedian fuck-o list.  Remember the days we had Jim Brewer on a lot, and Louis Black on a lot, and Jay Moore, who's  still a friend of the show.  Jay Moore is a huge friend of the show.  Yeah, I know.  I don't want to throw him on any list.  He just doesn't participate as much as he used to right now.  That's all.  He's banging Mickey Cox at four in the morning, and he closes off.  I don't blame him.  Yeah, he doesn't have time for comedy.  He's effing and sucking and walking. 
[02:07:30]  Busy guy.  And then Dice, he's kind of on the fence, but he hasn't really done...  I'm on the fence.  He hasn't done anything for the show.  I'm on the fence over here.  I can't climb my big fat ass over it to get over there where you guys are.  So before we get into this controversial bit that we're about to start here, let's let  it be known that that's Jim Norton's seat.  He'll tell us what he's done.  We don't tell Jim what he's done.  He'll tell us.  I tell them.  Right. 
[02:08:00]  But we should back up and start with the Doug Forrester thing, because then it'll make  sense with the Bill Burr, Jim Norton thing.  I was passed over.  I have the seat first.  That's the way I wanted it.  That ain't the way I wanted it.  Oh, God, take Bob Kelly to the airport.  Let Jim do some Mickey Mouse sticker stop and run conkuma.  You think all your comedian friends behind the scenes are all secretly talking like, you  know, Jimmy's going to be in L.A. full time soon.  Secretly. 
[02:08:30]  I actually think I have a shot at that microphone in the studio.  I think my stupid friends who read message boards should realize that it is their guest  seat that has been swiped.  These dummies are all happy.  Like, yeah, it's funny.  He's doing good.  It's like, hey, shithead, guess who would have been in if he wasn't so good?  You dummies.  Jim's going to hold the seat like the Pope.  I'm going.  I'm fucking going nowhere.  Believe me.  Even if they fire me, I'll just fucking keep coming out of my car and sitting here for 
[02:09:00]  free.  Go ahead.  Do the show.  I'm not leaving.  Go ahead.  I'll just plug my gigs quietly while you're on commercial.  I don't give a shit.  So, it all started with Doug Forrester versus John Corzine.  John Corzine.  The New Jersey governor race.  We're looking for you guys to send in your local politicians going at it with each other  on local TV, by the way.  We have a great one.  I mean, the commercials are still, every night, they're all over the TV.  Yeah.  Just killing each other.  It's all mudslinging, and they use the dramatic music, like movie trailer drama music, horror 
[02:09:30]  music for their opponent, as they show him in grainy black and white slow motion video  looking very evil and looking like if you elect him, something awful is going to happen.  And then they show whoever the commercial's for, all of a sudden it's in color.  It's nice.  He's with his family.  The nice, pleasant music is playing.  And that's obviously used to sway your opinion of one of the people or the other, and it's  dishonest.  Yeah.  Instead of just talking about your credits, you bash the other guy, make him look bad. 
[02:10:00]  And then in the end, they thank the other person.  What?  I just, as Anthony was saying, I just would love to see a political campaign that was just  like completely honest.  Yeah.  Like, uh, so-and-so, his wife's a cunt.  All right, here's one of the commercials.  Property taxes are outrageous.  I'm fed up with the high property taxes.  Only Doug Forrester has a plan to cut property taxes 30% in three years. 
[02:10:30]  More relief for more people.  That's the Forrester plan.  John Corzine, he's voted 133 times for higher taxes.  Oh, wow.  I don't believe anything will change under Corzine.  Corzine won't change New Jersey.  Doug Forrester will.  I'm a Democrat who's voting for Doug Forrester.  We need Doug Forrester.  All right, so there you go.  That was a pretty basic commercial.  That's the people commercial.  You go out to the people.  That's a good place to begin.  You know what Doug Forrester's plan was about lowering the property taxes? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  You let, uh, you kick a bunch of people out and you allow a bunch of, well, let's just  say other people to move in.  Property value goes down.  Lower taxes.  I talked to Doug.  Not a good plan.  That's not a good plan.  Here's, uh, Popeyes.  Here's the pro-Corzine commercial.  Question.  Who was the only candidate for governor who has ever raised property taxes?  Answer, Doug Forrester.  In fact, the only time Forrester had any control over property taxes, he raised them 200%. 
[02:11:30]  John Corzine has proposed a real plan to lower property taxes.  It increases property tax rebates by 40% over the next four years.  And it's paid for by cutting waste, controlling spending, and growing New Jersey's economy.  John Corzine.  Honest.  Effective.  Experienced.  I like that because it's not vague.  By, uh, growing the economy.  Yeah, yeah.  Ugh.  That's specific.  Well, obviously he doesn't want to raise taxes.  That's like his platform.  And he's saying he's not going to raise taxes. 
[02:12:00]  He's just going to do these things.  But in those things are things that are going to be horrible for you.  Cutting services.  Like, all of a sudden now your garbage is getting picked up one day a week.  Uh, it's just all those little things.  The potholes in the road aren't getting fixed.  You know, the taxes do go somewhere.  So I don't know who to vote for now.  I get confused with this.  I like that Forrester guy.  Just for the fact that he probably had the ballsiest awful commercial.  Well, the next one's really good because it's the conga line of corruption.  Yeah.  Listen to this one, Jimmy. 
[02:12:30]  There's a conga line of corruption and waste in New Jersey.  Conservative businessman Doug Forrester will take a big broom and sweep it clean.  The Forrester Plan.  An independent elected state auditor to fight corruption and waste in government.  Cut property taxes.  A supermajority in the legislature to stop politicians from raising taxes.  The politicians created this mess.  A strong businessman will clean it up.  Doug Forrester for governor. 
[02:13:00]  Doug Forrester wants to get rid of the Jews that are stealing your jobs.  Can I tell you, all I was listening to, like I was registering the words, but the musical  background was atrocious.  It was just so inconsistent.  It's like a little soft piano and then boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Well, that's how they do it.  And then the nice little plink, plink.  That piano is just reserved for retard videos, like retard documentaries and cancer hospital commercials. 
[02:13:30]  That's pretty much the only time that little plinky piano should be played.  When you're trying to run for office.  What about the Flight of the Bumblebee?  That's what they should play during these commercials.  Is that what that is, the Flight of the Bumblebee?  That's that fast one, yeah.  It's called Flight of the Bumblebee.  Imagine the Flight of Ben's Hog.  It's just clank, clank, clank.  Lumbering, boom, boom. 
[02:14:00]  Phantom of the Opera would have to play it.  Heavy, awful organ.  Ben's Hog music.  No, Ben's Hog music.  Every time a zipper comes down, it goes, boom, boom, boom, boom.  And he doesn't have to take it out.  Ben just unzips it, and the head wriggles itself out and looks around.  I'm no kin to a rhinoceros.  My God, it's Yul Brynner.  What's it doing? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, it's Ben's Hog music.  What's it called?  Baby Elephant Walk.  Baby Elephant Walk.  I've got to use this urinal.  There it is.  All right.  Because while he's talking, that mischievous penis has lowered itself and is now taking hunt  like hay and shoveling it up. 
[02:15:00]  Ben doesn't even notice it's doing it.  Takes water out of the urinal and sprays it down his back.  That's why his hair's always messy.  His cock is always spraying urinal water on it.  Picks up the urinal cake and tries to eat it.  He doesn't know.  He's on the phone.  His cock is trying to put the urinal cake in his mouth.  He's going to keep talking.  Yeah, psycho cameras on.  Tom Brady.  All right.  Anyway. 
[02:15:30]  Where is he?  I love looking at him.  I get all upset.  He just shakes his head.  He's just shaking.  I can see his head.  He just shakes his head.  What you see is the back of the baseball cap, but where the little things that adjust,  where you can see they've been broken and you have the big piece of tape connecting the  back pieces.  His regular hat won't fit.  Ben's got a big head.  Ben's a good boy.  I think we got the Dem Bosses commercial.  Ah, this is a good one.  It's a very disturbing pattern.  Tapes released by the attorney general make it clear John Corzine is too close to the 
[02:16:00]  most powerful Democrat bosses to bring the change New Jersey demands.  On the tapes, Boss Norcross said,  Yesterday morning, I'm up in Summit in John Corzine's home having breakfast, and I talk to  the guy once a week.  The pattern is very clear.  Corzine's self-described political mentor, Bob Torricelli, was forced to resign in disgrace,  and Corzine even partnered with now-convicted Democrat donor Charles Kushner to buy the  owner.  And that's Kushner is going to jail.  Listen again to Dem Boss Norcross.  In the end, the McGreebys, the Corzines, they're all going to be with me. 
[02:16:30]  They have no choice.  New Jersey, you have a choice.  Listen to Republican Doug Forrester.  This is Doug Forrester.  We need a big change in New Jersey.  We've got to break the cycle of bosses and corruption.  That's the first step to reducing spending and cutting your taxes.  They're all tied together.  Character, courage, conviction.  Doug Forrester for governor.  Paid for by Forrester for governor.  What a horrible, lying commercial.  I love Doug.  I love that guy.  Little piano music.  Democrats. 
[02:17:00]  They fuck children.  They made it sound like he was involved with some kind of organized crime.  They use bosses, as like everyone knows, you know, the head of the family is the boss,  some mob boss, they use that word, they use the grainy kind of static-y audio tape,  and him talking like he's got Corazine in his pocket.  Is that real audio?  Like so many judges.  So many nickels.  You've got to let Corazine draw from the well. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, if that's just nickels and dimes, too.  Saloo, Doug Forrester.  Salazzo's mouth opening.  I'm the hunted one.  Open.  Open.  You think too much of me, kid.  Open.  Is that, uh...  Not that good.  Is that real audio?  I don't know.  He goes, listen what this guy, whoever his name is, said.  They didn't say, here's a tape of him.  They just said, listen what he said.  Right.  And then maybe they were reading a transcript or something. 
[02:18:00]  I mean, that's actual audio that they kind of like fixed with, so it sounds like a wiretap.  So it sounds like a wiretap.  Yeah.  It's underhanded.  Oh, I see.  Dem bosses.  Dave in Houston.  Hey, how's it going?  How about those Astros?  Yeah, fuck the Astros.  Just want to sound, uh, you know, local.  Yeah.  That's right.  They teach you that in broadcasting school.  How about those Astros?  Yeah.  30 minutes past the hour.  Oh, very good.  Exactly.  Now, I'm a trucker on the road here.  Just had me passing through Houston. 
[02:18:30]  I think you just found Ben's walk-on music.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Very good.  You know what?  We've got to explain that to Jimmy.  Time to go off on a slight tangent here.  Eric, could you leave the...  Don't play it as he's leaving.  Eric, could you leave the studio?  Mm-hmm.  This happened since you've been gone, Jimmy.  You've missed so much as far as the show goes.  I'll be.  This was going on for like two straight weeks.  Every time Eric walked into the studio, this is what you would hear.  I'm scared.  All right, Eric. 
[02:19:00]  Eric.  Eric, we need you for something.  Look how gay.  Is that the worst walk-on music ever?  Awful.  But he's such a Paul Abdul fan that that has to be his walk-on music.  We learned that.  So, all right, Eric, you having a good time today?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Eric.  Thanks, Eric.  Why don't you leave the studio? 
[02:19:30]  Look it.  He tries not to walk to the music.  Yeah, but he can't help it.  It's all awkward.  His shoulders move.  Stop trying to stiff-walk, homo.  We know you love it.  All right.  All right.  Come back in the studio because I do need you to my left here.  Yeah.  You're right.  He is trying to walk.  He is not trying to be in time for music.  He's walking like the butler from Arthur.  Follow me.  Walk this way.  Walk this way.  Eric came up with this.  Walk that way.  And there were times like he would try to sneak back into the studio and we'd be in the middle  of some crazy like discussion or bit and the music would start up and fuck us all up. 
[02:20:00]  So I guess we got Ben's walk-on music now.  We'll try that.  Yeah, we'll try that one.  Ben's never going to come back in the studio now.  We have one more of these political ads and then we do the Bill and Jimmy thing.  That's where we're heading with this, guys.  Because a bunch of people are saying, hey, you did this already.  Yeah.  Is Doug Forrester mainstream or extreme?  Extreme.  Let's take a look.  Right.  Just like George Bush, he opposes embryonic stem cell research.  He supported the Bush tax breaks for the wealthiest that have led to cuts in funding for education, 
[02:20:30]  special education, and health care here in New Jersey.  He wants to make taxpayers rather than corporate polluters pay for the cleanup of toxic waste.  Doug Forrester.  He's George Bush's choice for governor.  Easy new words.  And George Bush is an asshole.  Trying to tie him in with Bush because Bush's approval rating going down the shitter,  so it's like he's George Bush's candidate.  He wants taxpayers to pay for toxic waste.  What? 
[02:21:00]  Cleanup?  What?  Yeah.  Doesn't want big corporations.  So a corporation could just dump toxic waste on your lawn and go, eh, you pay for it, fucko.  I'm ready for a change.  I'm tired of Bush.  Oh, yeah.  Ugh.  All they would have had to do is come up with someone better than Kerry.  Yeah.  And they fucked that whole thing up.  For this time, just because somebody's really good.  Publicans are in trouble.  Eli from Columbia.  Eli's calling.  Columbia.  Yeah.  What's up, man? 
[02:21:30]  Hey.  Hey, uh, I've got to...  Ben's welcome music has got to be the, uh, theme from 2001.  Hmm.  Why?  Because it's just so huge?  Yeah.  And monolith-like?  Monolithic?  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, wow.  Bill's not shaving.  No.  That means he's ready to kill again.  Holy gee, yeah.  Yeah, I've got my hunting beard on.  Intern Bill has not shaved.  Something bad's going to happen to somebody.  What a friggin' mountain man. 
[02:22:00]  The little guy with a huge goddamn Grizzly Adams beard.  That's a two-day growth.  That's two days, right.  All right.  Wow.  So now we get into the Jimmy Norton versus Bill Burk thing.  That Steve and, uh, well, Danny came up with the idea, and Steve and Danny threw these  together, right?  All of you guys?  I'm sorry.  All of you guys.  Wow, I know you.  What is that little...  What's Fiona Applebody doing here?  Hey!  Hey, remember him?  I remember you.  That little wave.  What's his name?  Sam!  I am Sam.  I am Sam is here. 
[02:22:30]  Just ignore him when he comes in.  Remember him?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Very cool.  We didn't say come in here.  We just said we remember you.  Oh, wow.  Go in there.  Go in there.  Go in there.  No.  We just want to acknowledge that we remember you.  Hi.  How's school?  Good.  All right, good.  Look how big you didn't get.  Dude, what about the family tree thing?  We got into that with you.  We started that.  And, like, what happened?  The family tree.  Have you come closer to realizing anything about that?  I don't know.  Nothing.  Nothing.  You're still related to Thomas Jefferson? 
[02:23:00]  Yes.  All right.  Yes.  School again.  School.  Good.  School.  All right.  What have you been up to?  I'm a...  No one cares.  We really don't.  I mean...  No.  Any broadcasting, though?  I mean...  How do you do?  I'm Sam.  Thank you all.  There you go, Sam.  Did you have this?  He interned for us, I don't even know, three, four semesters ago by now. 
[02:23:30]  We've had 30 guys come through since Sam.  Hi, this is Sam!  Oh, God, stop it.  All right, so there's a campaign going on.  There's a Jim Norton, Bill Burr thing happening.  You dick!  It's the same guy.  Exactly.  So you want to hear the pro-Jimmy?  The pro-Jimmy ad.  Political ad?  All right, here it is.  In his act, Bill Burr laughs about mushing an old lady's homemade muffins at a street fair.  Bill Burr also thinks women are a black hole for fun. 
[02:24:00]  Jim Norton loves women.  In fact, he even pays for their company all the time.  Jim Norton for Third Mike.  People are about a fan of Jim Norton.  I like that, the good nice music kicks in.  That evil Bill Burr music.  All right, here's a pro-Bill Burr campaign ad.  Escorts, urine, pornography.  These are only a few things Jim Norton enjoys.  Jim Norton has even fantasized about jerking off his girlfriend's father. 
[02:24:30]  If he is elected Third Mike, who's to say he won't fantasize about jerking off your father?  Bill Burr would never rape your family.  Bill Burr for Third Mike.  I hate for my fans of Bill Burr.  That's really funny.  Oh, is that awful?  Well, now I've got to vote for Bill Burr, obviously.  And that isn't even wrong.  That isn't even dishonest.  Right.  He actually did fantasize about that. 
[02:25:00]  Well, the fantasy part's not accurate.  I would just do that to kind of gross her out.  You guys got to come up with more.  Here's a pro-Jimmy campaign ad.  Bill Burr hates gays and opposes gay marriage.  Do you want a closed-minded fascist as your Third Mike?  Jim Norton frequently visits the transgendered communities.  Jim Norton has offered free rides to many transsexuals.  Jim Norton for Third Mike.  Paid for by the fans of Jim Norton.  That's true. 
[02:25:30]  Well, I don't know about that.  Could be.  And finally, one more for Bill Burr.  Question.  Who is the only Third Mike guest on the Opie and Anthony show to tell an XM subscriber to, quote,  flush his XM down the toilet and fuck his mother?  Answer.  Jim Norton.  I don't care if you throw your XM down the toilet, buy a series, and then fuck your mother.  Bill Burr has had nothing but nice things to say, like good morning and thanks for calling  Bill Burr. 
[02:26:00]  Caring, gentle, redhead.  Bill Burr for Third Mike.  Paid for by the fans of Bill Burr.  That was very funny.  I love the music change.  Well, that's absolutely true.  You did tell that person to flush his XM down the toilet and fuck his mother.  Well, Elo sat right there.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  He was right next to you that day.  Yes, he was.  You know that we probably gained thousands of listeners that day?  Thousands.  Of course.  We turned thousands of listeners into fans after that rant.  All right.  We're going to take a break. 
[02:26:30]  Stalker Patty's here.  Wonderful.  She was on Maury Povich yesterday.  She was on Meery.  We'll see what that's all about.  Also, Katie Holmes.  Pregnant.  Tom Cruise.  Katie the Wad Holmes.  Yes.  And guess what?  Katie Holmes may have a silent childbirth.  Yeah, I've been reading about this.  Scientologists seem to be into this whole thing.  How about after the break we get into it and then we'll do the Stalker Patty as well, okay?  Silent childbirth.  Silent childbirth next on the ONA show. 
[02:27:00]  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  I like it as much as the next guy.  This is really funny stuff.  But are we now alleging that this is Pat O'Brien?  Imus is playing him as well.  Imus is playing it?  Yeah, but he can't play him like we're playing him.  Yeah, I've got to edit all the fun stuff out.  You just imagine.  A bunch of bleeps and bluffs.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here's Pat O'Brien talking about a boop job.  It stinks. 
[02:27:30]  Wish I was on that.  Satellite.  Satellite.  I'm no dummy.  I'm sorry.  Talk to me like that.  I'm Imus.  Yeah, yeah.  Satellite.  You were right.  I'm a dick.  Boy, I like to eat your pussy.  You can't.  Suck in my cock.  I'll lick your tits.  Yeah, yeah, baby.  Yeah, so just wink at me when I'm walking by here. 
[02:28:00]  If I tip my cowboy hat at you, it means I want to fuck you.  Imus in the morning.  Jesus, dude.  That's a really good impression.  When I have my, look, I want to jiggle my turkey neck at you.  All right, look, I'm going to teabag you.  And my testes hang real low because I'm an old man.  And if you want that, just wink at me, baby.  Because I want to lick that pussy and suck those tits, baby. 
[02:28:30]  Baby!  I want to do a Billy Saul Hargis bit while you suck my cock.  Moby Worm's coming to get you out of my pants.  Moby and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[02:29:00]  Bam, bam.  Let's say hi to Dan in Arizona.  Dan, what's going on today?  Hey, man, nothing.  I'm just driving to work.  All right.  Love your program, man.  There's nothing much missing out here in Arizona.  And we care why?  I care what?  Opie, Dan is the man.  That's why we should care.  Dan, how nice is it in Arizona today? 
[02:29:30]  You know what?  I think it's about 78, 79.  That's nice.  All right, listen.  Beautiful, beautiful day.  I am making a pledge to Don Wicklin.  Anthony and I, and I'm dead serious.  This is not a bit.  Uh-oh.  We do not want to broadcast from New York City in January.  No.  Figure it out.  Here's what we need.  Figure it out.  We need places to stay.  Separate condos.  Right.  Condos or something.  Where we can bring our own shit.  Right.  We need separate condos. 
[02:30:00]  Very close to the broadcast facility, so the commute isn't bad.  In a very warm climate.  Yeah.  No, no, I'm listening to you, but I suggest it as to where.  Very warm climate that we can broadcast from comfortably for a long period of time.  I want to be out of New York for the whole month of January.  Dude, it's obvious.  Maybe even longer.  This XM thing, we're a national program.  There's no reason to be here in January.  January and February.  Two months. 
[02:30:30]  Well, I would like two months, but let's see if you can pull off one month.  The only problem is this.  Where would you go?  West Palm?  Where do we have facilities?  West Palm Beach, I think?  Yeah, either Florida or somewhere.  Which is still cold.  No, Nashville's still fucking cold.  Not as cold as this, though.  No, still cold.  We have a studio in Deerfield Beach, Florida.  Where's that?  Between West Palm and Fort Lauderdale.  Between West Palm and Fort Lauderdale.  That is perfect.  Perfect.  All right, that's where we broadcast from.  That's where we broadcast starting January.  Kick everyone out of that facility. 
[02:31:00]  And make it happen.  Make it happen.  That's right.  We want to meet our Florida listeners.  And not a quick thing where we have to schlep in a hotel for a week.  It's not a cute one week thing.  This, we need, like, permanent facility.  That's how it's got to be set up, so we can stay there for a length of time.  For the month of January, condos near a beach.  Yes.  Near a beach.  What's the scale on that map?  Is it right on the beach?  It looks like it's within a couple miles, right? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's where we want to be.  Go to the legend.  Deerfield Beach, Florida.  That's where your pals will be for the month of January.  What's the temperature there right now?  Yeah, Eric.  Get me a weather report stat, Eric.  Deerfield.  I want to know what the temperature is like.  What is the temperature there in January?  I want to know what the temperature is there in January.  Get it for him, Hawk.  He doesn't like to wait.  Let's say hi to Roger in D.C. as we get the temperature for Anthony.  Roger?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Why don't you just broadcast from L.A. for the next couple months so Jimmy can be there? 
[02:32:00]  I'll tell you why they can't because of the time difference, dude.  It's the only problem.  Oh, yeah.  80 degrees right now?  It's 80 degrees in our new home, Anthony.  Right now, 80.  We would be in 80 degree weather right now.  In our new home.  But in January, it must get down to what?  70?  High 60s, maybe?  Although it is still early, so 80 degrees might be 90 degrees today.  How far from Fort Lauderdale is that?  It's Fort Lauderdale.  I thought you guys had some listeners, man.  Yeah, point out Fort Lauderdale on the map.  Point it out for him.  Please.  Hawk.  Come on there, Hawk. 
[02:32:30]  Come on.  Zoom out.  Keep fucking around, Hawk.  Take your time.  Well, it's near Boca.  Fort Lauderdale's right here.  And where are we?  Holy crap.  We're close to Fort Lauderdale.  About 20 minutes.  Which means we're close to South Beach.  Which means you've got a lot of box running in and out of that studio.  All right.  It's flopping.  All right.  Wow.  So, there it is.  Project ONA.  We will be broadcasting in January from Deerfield Beach.  What is that episode?  Normal high in January?  75 degrees.  75?  We found where we're going. 
[02:33:00]  Just make it happen.  That's it.  Make it happen.  Condos.  Oh, by the way, the whole staff, too.  Yeah, we need the whole staff.  Oh, yeah.  You guys ain't staying here.  Stop it.  Any comedy clubs around there?  Yeah, but I mean where I can do spots on a nightly basis.  There must be one.  A Boca Nuts.  We'll find a chuckle hut for Jimmy.  Yeah.  We'll find a Giggles.  You guys are going to have to share a condo, though.  All right.  They'll share a condo.  It'll be like a dorm room.  One twin bed.  We need three condos, type of.  We need a real living environment.  We can't be living out of a hotel.  That would be just awful. 
[02:33:30]  No, no.  We're fancy.  We need a real place.  That's right.  And then those guys can, you know.  Don listens.  Be a frat house.  He's listening right now.  Trust me, Don.  This is not a bit.  This is what we want for January.  We started talking about this last winter, and we said to ourselves, we don't want to be  stuck in New York in January.  The cold makes us cranky.  That's right.  And we want a happy show.  Happy show is a successful show.  We've decided to do happy shows from now on.  And we can do a happy show in Deerfield.  We're not going to get many guests, but who cares?  We'll interview the locals. 
[02:34:00]  Who cares?  Yeah.  There's a bevy of guests right outside that studio door, I bet, that isn't being taken  advantage of.  Fort Lauderdale.  You'd be surprised.  You've got people going through Fort Lauderdale.  I mean, that's a pretty big place as far as entertainment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So we'll do just fine.  Make it happen.  Plenty of gay people.  In Fort Lauderdale?  Right.  I don't know.  I never thought.  I thought it was all chicks.  Hawk.  Or gals.  Boy, I'm so disappointed I didn't know where the gay people were.  Hawk, where are the gay people in Florida?  Don't act like you don't know where I am.  You know Florida like the back of your hand. 
[02:34:30]  That's right.  You know Florida like the back of your head.  Down in Miami.  Miami?  What part, though?  That I don't know.  Fort Lauderdale doesn't have gays?  Never had a gay reputation?  No, Fort Lauderdale.  It was hot.  Yeah, a lot of chicks, man.  A lot of girls in there.  Yeah.  Beautiful girls.  Beautiful girls.  Beautiful girls.  That's where spring break used to be.  So that's a lot.  Wonderful.  Uh-oh.  Deerfield Beach sucks.  Oh.  Jeff in Florida.  What's wrong with Deerfield?  Ah, Deerfield sucks, man.  The accommodations are horrid.  You got any stations around Pensacola or even Panama City? 
[02:35:00]  Hell, even go to Tampa and kick the crap out of Lex and Terry, but stay out of Deerfield.  That's the armpit of the south.  No, you don't understand.  No matter how bad Deerfield Beach sucks, it's better in January than any beach on Long Island.  Yeah, well, actually, yeah, that's probably true.  I figured if you wanted plush accommodations, go to someplace other than Deerfield Beach.  Go farther down south, like South Beach or something like that, but you're getting right  into West Palm and Deerfield Beach. 
[02:35:30]  It's really, the accommodations aren't five-star, which you guys deserve.  West Palm is not bad, though.  I've done the improv.  They put you up in a really nice hotel.  We got to figure this out.  For the month of January, we hit the road.  How about we hit the road with tour buses?  No.  We got to do something.  No tour buses.  Tour buses.  I will not go on a bus and do things on a bus.  Two separate buses.  Nope.  I will not be on a fucking bus.  The people that like you and the people that like me.  Nope.  In other words, I will have a bus to myself.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:36:00]  You'll be fucking hula-hooping in there alone.  Nope.  We need...  It's just me thanking you from the PA from Ant's bus.  Thank you, Opie.  It's wonderful.  Dude, you changed my life.  I'll talk in a bit.  I have to go.  I'll be right back.  Condos.  What happened?  Oh, no.  Oh, do I?  Get the mic.  I'll bring the phone.  Bring the phone.  Wait, you're going to die?  Yeah.  It's going to be...  Could be.  Could be a winner.  No, it can't be.  I can just tell you this.  I can feel it in my intestines. 
[02:36:30]  It's like stew.  Okay.  Call up.  It's not going to be a photograph.  This is not going to be a photo op.  This is going to be fucking...  This is going to be a levy break.  Wait.  I'm thinking about a dump off.  I'm feeling confident right in myself.  Oh, no.  Wait, let me jump up and down.  Anything?  Got something?  Something cooking?  It sucks that all my bits are very funny, but they're visual. 
[02:37:00]  Opie is jumping up and down right now, just trying to see if he can loosen that log.  No, I think you're on your own.  I don't want to dud.  I could try, but...  You'd be pushing and straight, and then you hear a little plink as one of your pebble shits  falls out.  Dude, take a picture, because it could be in the running.  It won't be.  It really could be, because we're not only looking for size.  It's being judged across all kind of levels.  I'll tell you where the dumps are going to come.  When I go back to L.A. next week, because the trailer, the bathroom, the way they have,  this is one of those, it's a waterless, there's water, but when you shit at first, if there's 
[02:37:30]  no water, you have to step on a little...  Right.  So what happens is, sometimes you get meat piles in your thing, it really is awful.  It's really unpleasant.  I've got to wait for the trap door.  Does it have a little trap door that works with a foot pedal?  Yeah, exactly.  Foot pedal.  So now, if you've got a lot of dump on it, you could feel the resistance in the foot pedal  as it tries to slide from the bottom of the dump?  It looks like a cue ball, and then it moves out of the way, and the dump collapses in,  and the water comes and washes the side. 
[02:38:00]  Right, a little ball valve.  Yes.  Yeah, but when it goes back, the ball valve is filthy, because it has logs on it?  Yeah, yeah, it has a little streak on it.  When you have to dump in that situation, you realize how smelly and awful...  Oh, without the water?  ...your waste really is.  Back in the day, it was speckle buckets.  The water really does save it.  It still is bad, but, man, without that water, wow.  All right, Jimmy's heading out.  It really does stink like an animal.  Here he goes.  He's finishing his coffee before he goes in.  If I could wait, I'd wait, but I could just feel it.  All right, get on the phone.  Let it rip and get on the phone.  Wait, get on the phone right now before you leave the studio. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, get on the phone, because it's going to start really percolating when you go to  sit down.  Well, I've got to take my sweatshirt off, too.  I'm nuts when I shit.  He's nuts when he...  What do you go...  Like, what do you work out?  Yeah.  I mean, on the bowl as you're taking a dump?  No, I just don't...  My greatest fear when I'm taking a dump, it's a really weird one, is that I'm going to...  My shirt...  I have to pull my shirt up under my arms.  Like, my back has to be completely bare.  I'm so afraid that I'm going to get doody on the back of my shirt. 
[02:39:00]  Doody on the back of your shirt and be as shamed as Ben.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, please.  Call the hotline.  Oh, please.  That was my remark.  Oh, please.  Oh, please.  Good gosh.  Do we want a spotter?  I can call him.  I don't think you'd want anybody in there.  I don't want a guy in there, no.  No.  I can't dump with a guy in there.  How are you supposed to shit with a guy in there and sitting there with a...  All right, we'll call right now.  Take the phone.  Get good acoustics right in the crotch area so it's nice and echoey.  Yeah, I want him to call you.  Do you realize on every other show...  Let me just point this out.  I would have to excuse myself to you.  I got to use the facilities.  You guys would go, all right, just come back. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  But on this show, make sure you get the phone by your asshole so the country can hear it.  We need to hear your pain.  It might not be loud, though.  I'm not going to promise it.  Well, you never know.  It's a crapshoot.  It is.  Cut it out.  You've got to use muscles, that quick little blast of muscles.  All right.  You've got to work it a little bit.  Help it out.  All right.  Also on the show today, we've got Stalker Patty.  Patty had her big makeover.  Yeah, she's anxiously waiting to come in here.  Is she working today? 
[02:40:00]  Usually she would have had to have been in work, I guess.  I don't know.  It's a big day.  She's now a TV star.  She had her makeover on the Maury Povich Show.  It was videotaped yesterday.  Right.  Word from the producers of the show.  It came out great.  They loved it.  And they will tell us when it airs.  Right.  But they gave her a whole makeover.  Jimmy?  I'm trying to find a clean stall here.  This is the one I'm going into right now.  Hold on.  It has a little bit of a...  It has like a little log mark on the bottom.  Look at that. 
[02:40:30]  Now I've got to paper the seats.  Oh, you paper?  You bet I do.  I don't paper.  I saw a whole show where toilet seats don't have as much germs on them as like almost everything  else you touch on a daily basis.  No, no.  It's the tea that I'm worried about.  I don't want to sit in someone's tinkle.  You hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your logic is dumb.  I know.  The stuff you do in your apartment with these ladies.  Now you're papering the toilet seat.  Hold on.  All right.  Let me see.  I don't know what this is going to be.  All right.  All right. 
[02:41:00]  Did you get any of that?  Oh, God.  The bottom dropped out.  That's what I call a...  Never mind.  I had a silent childbirth.  God.  Did you hear it?  Did we?  I think there's more in there.  All right.  Let's listen.  But unfortunately, there was no gas with it.  That's okay.  That was like...  It was warm borscht. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  I have push.  Okay.  I want to piss on my phone, though.  Hold on.  Push.  God, Timmy.  No, not yet.  Oh, God.  Is that disgusting?  Oh, you heard a little bit?  Yeah.  I heard a little...  A little squeak.  I got a photo.  I wish I had my camera for pizza.  You can't see anything, you know.  It looks like somebody dumped coffee with a couple of papa beans. 
[02:42:00]  It's a toilet.  Oh, did that sound horrible?  Oh, it really does.  Just a ker...  That was a kerplunk.  It's like he dropped a tomato just directly into the bowl.  Like sauce.  It definitely sounded like sauce.  Like you were pouring sauce from the pot into Tupperware.  I'm trying to... 
[02:42:30]  I'll tell you if I've got any more coffee.  What did he say?  I don't want to...  We'll just continue and he'll tell us if he's got any more.  He's got to just sit there.  Someone's walking in the grave.  I'll say something.  What?  Oh, thank you.  Someone just handed me my camera.  What a good boy.  Yeah, it's...  Okay.  Wow, that's what you call a little dinner.  It was somebody we know.  That's why.  I didn't know if Jimmy...  If he was going to pull a gag on Jimmy or not.  Oh, okay.  So I didn't want Jimmy to know it was one of our guys that walked in.  All right.  But he was just handing him the camera so he could take a picture. 
[02:43:00]  Jim, you about done?  No, no, no.  I'm sitting...  I take a minute because I feel like...  You know how you're sitting there?  And you can feel like a hefty weight in there, but it's just working its way through the pipes.  Like in my case, it's just seeping.  It's seeping down to the fucking exit.  All right.  I got something else.  Don't worry.  I don't know.  To top that first one, you're going to need a lot.  Let me just try to push one more time.  All right.  Here we go.  Okay.  I hope I don't hurt myself. 
[02:43:30]  Don't hurt.  Nah, nothing.  If you guys just do what you do, I'll listen.  If I have anything, I'll just go.  Hey.  All right.  Well, we're going to talk about Katie Holmes.  She's going to have a silent...  It's looking like she's going to have a silent childbirth.  Ooh.  According to Scientologist Belief.  We got some audio of this.  Want to listen to it?  I think we just did.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Here we go.  Toilet.  Here we go.  When Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes announced they were expecting a child,  speculation about the birth started immediately. 
[02:44:00]  The couple practices Scientology, where mothers are encouraged to perform silent births.  That means no yelling or talking during the delivery.  Even doctors are asked to keep quiet.  And while the church doesn't ban painkillers, many mothers refrain from using them.  What's usually a noisy delivery room was nearly silent when celebrity Scientologist Leah Remini documented her child's birth.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Actress Kelly Preston delivered her daughter this way and admitted to Red Book it wasn't easy. 
[02:44:30]  She said it got hardcore at the end because she was so big.  Stop whining.  I changed her mind and said, throw me in the car.  I want an epidural.  But Preston was too far along and had to give birth at home.  Ooh.  Jesus.  What the fuck is with the silent child birth?  They want the women to give birth without screaming?  What bit of Scientology is that?  What, like, what's the upside?  He's got to have some kind of thing where it's like they say that you've got to do this because. 
[02:45:00]  I'm hoping.  Is it some trauma to the child?  All right, that's what you've got to figure.  You want to bring him into the world in complete silence.  What was that, Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  What is that?  What is that?  I'm fiddling.  Oh.  It sounds like you've got a stone blocking.  Oh.  Blocking, uh.  Oh.  What a little squishy girl sound. 
[02:45:30]  You might want to have that checked.  It's coming out of his vagina.  It's like when you turn off the hose and you step on it.  Something comes out.  By the way, Anthony, we started the childbirth audio thing.  Yeah.  We haven't received any yet.  Not a one.  Remember that?  People videotape their deliveries.  We just want the audio portion of your wife during her giving birth. 
[02:46:00]  We want to hear the screaming and yelling and the cursing.  Yeah.  We don't want video of her.  Yeah.  That's real childbirth.  Yeah.  The cursing and the screaming and the carrying on.  That's what we want.  All right.  More on the silent childbirth here.  Fellow Scientologist Brittany Wadhams refused painkillers and tried her best to stay quiet.  About a half an hour before pushing, that was when it got more difficult.  And that was when I would have a contraction and I would start screaming.  Doctors who perform silent births say medically there's nothing wrong with the practice. 
[02:46:30]  But adhering to it might be impossible.  Many women, I would think, would be very, very difficult to maintain complete silence during delivery.  It can be extremely uncomfortable physically and there can be an emotional component that would be hard to be totally silenced.  Officials here at the Church of Scientology say that a silent birth is practiced at the discretion of the parents and their doctor.  It's believed that quiet in the delivery room can reduce trauma during birth and therefore prevent irrational fears later in life. 
[02:47:00]  Ah.  Prevent traumas in birth.  There's a lot of people walking around and they're just fine.  And their mom's screaming like crazy there.  Yeah.  What are they talking about?  Silent childbirth.  Stop making up shit.  Yeah, that's what they're doing.  They're just making up shit.  Sounds like a bunch of...  What?  It sounds like a bunch of newfangled bunk. 
[02:47:30]  They're just making up shit.  They're developing their religion in front of our eyes.  Yep.  I bet you this is what happened back in the day, though.  Yeah, because 2,000 years from now, it'll all sound perfectly rational.  It'll make sense.  Yeah, it'll make sense.  But right now, it's cuckoo.  It's plain cuckoo talk.  You know, thousands of years ago, they just sat around and said,  All right, time to make up the rules.  Yeah.  Let's make up some rules.  Some rules and here's what it is.  No meat on Friday.  All right.  That's a good one. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  Let's write that down.  Jot that down.  Let's see.  We've got to populate this planet, so no birth control.  Yeah, yeah.  Be fruitful.  Be fruitful so we can populate this big rock that we live on.  Yeah, yeah.  What else?  I keep banging the neighbor's wife, and he keeps getting pissed at me.  Right.  Perhaps we shouldn't covet her.  Don't covet thy neighbor's wife.  All right.  Let's make that rule.  I like that one. 
[02:48:30]  What other rules for our new religion?  That's how it came about.  They just sat around.  Yeah.  Drank a little wine and then made up shit.  Making stuff up.  We've got more audio here.  Asking doctors to go along felt awkward for Lawrence Woodcraft, a former member of the  church.  He was there when his daughters were born using the silent birth method.  To me, it was very strange and embarrassing, particularly asking medical staff and doctors  to be quiet, and they're like, you know, well, we had to do our job.  So that was stressful and difficult. 
[02:49:00]  Some Scientologists say the church has recommended counseling, known as auditing, for mothers  who are unable to stay silent.  My goal was to do it as best as I could and to just know that, you know, what I believed  in, I tried to follow as closely as possible.  It's unknown whether Katie and Tom will choose a silent birth for their baby, but for Brittany,  it meant giving her son a healthy start.  Oh, please.  You don't know shit.  A healthy start.  Please.  Stop it. 
[02:49:30]  Stop it.  All right.  Jimmy, you're done.  Stop it.  Yes.  Okay.  You done, Jimmy?  Yeah, yeah, I just gave you the old flush.  All right, because we're getting ready to bring Stalker Patty in here.  Oh, that was lovely.  There it is.  Silent childbirth.  That's what the Scientologists are all about.  See you, sir.  All right.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Jimmy will be back in a minute here.  Oh.  How did that happen?  You just said goodbye on the phone, and now I'm here.  I was already walking in, and I flushed while you guys were playing audio.  Do you get a picture?  Yeah.  Can I see it? 
[02:50:00]  We are having the dump contest.  Oh, this is nothing.  How about a little silence after the birth?  It's, you know, SIDS.  God's little practical joke.  Holy crap, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Look at this thing.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Are you going to enter that one?  God.  No, it's not.  I took one yesterday.  I took this photo.  I hope I...  How many photos do we have?  So far, we only have Danny's.  E.  E-Rock has one? 
[02:50:30]  Who else?  Well, no.  Jimmy said he doesn't want to...  I haven't.  This one's not...  He's not handing that one in.  Oh.  If they ever made a toilet bowl full of elk shit stew...  You see the little things...  That's what it would look like.  Floating around in there?  Yeah.  It looks like a...  Like...  Little pieces of...  God, take a look.  Uh...  Don't be shy.  Why don't you be shy?  No.  Look, you can see, like, little pieces of black...  That's probably stuff that scrunches off the wall of the colon.  Hey.  Looks like tea that's been steeping for a century. 
[02:51:00]  I see Bourbon Street.  It's an aerial shot.  That's awful.  Speaking of Bourbon Street...  Yeah.  Do we know or do we know Mardi Gras returns in February?  Oh, yeah.  We said, don't worry about it.  People thought we were nuts for even saying that on our show.  Everything will be back to normal.  The day or a couple days after Hurricane Katrina, we said, you watch Bourbon Street, Mardi Gras,  will happen.  They're getting all that area taken care of. 
[02:51:30]  They're getting the city center with the buildings and everything and offices all together.  It's those outlying areas where all the poor black people lived.  Their houses will probably just be, you know, bulldozed because it is worth fixing them up.  And then they'll do something with that land.  They'll probably do something that will increase the value of it.  And more wealthier people will move in and they'll have a bigger, richer city.  Yeah.  If you're a city, why would you, you know, quickly rebuild the ghetto? 
[02:52:00]  You wouldn't.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you just let it kind of sit there knowing that a lot of those people would just kind of give up?  They'll give up.  They'll leave.  And they'll leave and go live somewhere else.  And that helps the whole value of your city.  Bulldoze it over and then you start building some stuff.  And before you know it, you have a richer city.  All right.  Anyway, hurricanes are old news anyway.  It's all about the bird flu.  And George Bush, we have a quick clip of him talking about the bird flu.  And if we're ready. 
[02:52:30]  Bird flu.  Well, it's the bird flu pandemic.  I can't get it queued up, though.  I can't get it queued up.  Oh, instant feedback's back?  Hope so.  This is the actual footage.  I've missed you all, fuckers.  Let's say hi to Turtle.  Turtle!  What's up, boys?  We're waiting for the Lord Opie, the destroyer, to hand down the rules for his most holy church.  The Church of Opie, yes. 
[02:53:00]  I don't even think you make up the rules for that.  No, that website is very creepy, I've got to tell you.  Scary gentleman.  I'm not sure what I think of the Church of Opie website yet.  In line, skate in peace, my Lord.  But you know that's how religion started.  They just sat around and made up rules.  Made up things that made sense back in the day.  And then we have to live with the same rules thousands of years later.  So stupid.  Whatever you do, they'll think is the way the religion should be.  Like they'll say, thou shalt only dump once a week. 
[02:53:30]  You can't dump.  You can only shit on a Tuesday between like noon and three.  Wow, that would really suck.  You have to strain and bleed a little or you're a heretic.  What you're hearing right now is us stalling because the clip will not queue up.  Clark, what are we doing?  Stan's fixing it.  Uh-oh, fixing it.  Clark Clifford is suggesting a new bit.  Assault on Scientology births. 
[02:54:00]  Run in at the moment of birth and scream ONA on XM Satellite Radio.  We need one couple out there to be brave enough to send in the audio of the childbirth.  Exactly.  With the wife screaming and yelling.  Let's hear it.  We want to hear it.  Silent birth.  I heard that.  That was really annoying.  All right.  That's what you want to hear.  Just the sound of the vagina opening and the stupid head, that meaty sound it must make.  Well, what a great story that was in the paper about childbirth. 
[02:54:30]  There's a woman, she had 16 kids.  She just had her 16th child.  16.  And I think 18 years.  And they asked her if she's going to have more, and she said yes, because if God wants  me to, I will.  It's God's will.  Like a religious nut family that just keeps spitting kids out. 
[02:55:00]  Like so self-important, they think the world is such a better place with 16 of their spawn  running around when people are worried about, you know, overpopulation.  When is Jesus coming back?  Because he's got to update these rules.  Yeah.  Stop with the be fruitful and multiply.  That's when there was not many people around.  It made sense.  You see what's going on in China?  Chinese.  You can only have two kids.  Yeah, that's good.  You're only allowed two kids. 
[02:55:30]  Good.  That's enough.  And the reason is because it's overpopulated.  The earth in general is overpopulated.  Yeah.  Where's Jesus?  Where is he?  Jesus, please tell this woman to stop.  Her vagina looks like the scream mask.  What does it look like after 16 kids come sliding down that spout?  After you dump it, you probably have to push her feet up so it doesn't all leak out into  her shoes.  Jesus, Jesus. 
[02:56:00]  All right, I came, feet tramp in the air.  Let it seep in there.  Hold it in.  All right, are we ready for the George Bush clip?  We were talking about the bird flu.  What's going on?  I don't know.  Let's see what the president, he's on top of things.  With the bird flu?  Yeah.  He's all-knowing.  He's our leader.  Let's see what he's got to say about the bird flu.  This whole issue of a possible worldwide pandemic, this avian flu, you know, 60 people have died  in Asia so far.  They're worried that if this comes here, there was, by some estimates, this could claim millions 
[02:56:30]  of lives around the world.  Going to need tiny little tissues.  After Hurricane Katrina.  Going to need tiny little tissues for their little beaks.  Going to need little, little dristan things that could fit in a little bird beak.  Little, little theraflus.  Little theraflu.  Little NyQuil.  Well, I don't think they could drink a whole shot of that NyQuil stuff.  We're going to have to finance, through some economic stimulus, little plastic cups that  little birds can use. 
[02:57:00]  Maybe they'll dip in like those little things that take a couple of sips, bob down, and  then bob back up again and fold the red fluid.  Maybe that'll do.  We'll just put a little NyQuil thing and the birds can...  Jack hole.  ...around the world.  After Hurricane Katrina, there are some people in this country who are worried.  They're not sure who's in charge.  Who do I turn to?  Who's going to handle a major catastrophe in this country?  Are you confident that this administration has a plan in place to handle something like  that?  What does he say?  What does he say here?  Let's play what does he say. 
[02:57:30]  Now, he won't answer the question, because he never does.  So it's got to be...  Are you confident that we can handle a crisis like this?  Well, we've got Senator Scott D's control working on the problem.  He's going to talk about who's working on it.  Mm-hmm.  What's being done vaguely, but not answer the question, are we prepared?  Right now, the Center for D's control working the bird flu.  That's what he's going to do. 
[02:58:00]  I think he's going to point out the fact that the problem in Asia is that they never know  who's sick because you think it's one guy, and it turns out it was the other guy because  they look exactly the same.  So it's actually one guy who just went 60 times.  There's no epidemic.  We put out a composite sketch of the carrier of the bird flu from China, and they've already  arrested one billion people.  We're questioning...  We brought in a witness to look at the lineup, and he's now taking a car down the lineup. 
[02:58:30]  It should be done in about five years.  I'm confident that we're working to identify the possible outbreak of avian flu, contain  it to where the outbreak takes place, and strategize how to deal with the...  What would we take the lead in there?  Would it be a military situation?  Would it be...  What?  Homeland...  Huh?  Sitting in the army. 
[02:59:00]  He doesn't...  He didn't answer.  I know.  He goes, I'm confident we're working on...  It's no...  The guy asked, are you confident that we can handle this?  I'm confident that we're working on the ability to maybe handle something that happens eventually,  maybe.  Well, then Matt Lauer asked about the military or something?  Yeah, would there be a military involvement in it?  How to deal with the DeVere?  Who would take the lead in there?  Would it be a military situation?  Would it be Homeland Security? 
[02:59:30]  It's a really interesting question.  Uh-oh.  That means I don't have a fucking clue.  That absolutely means I don't have a fucking clue.  Why else would you say that?  They don't have a plan.  That's an interesting question.  Oh, fuck.  Well, the military...  How big are the birds?  We got any aircraft?  Oh, my God.  We could start shooting the birds out in the sky?  We're all fucked.  He's just hoping the bird flu doesn't hit while he's in office. 
[03:00:00]  I'm going to give that question off to Don Rumsfeld.  Oh, he's not here.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  How you doing, Matt?  I was just thinking about how the last epidemic was handled.  Well, we're going to close all the bathhouses and get little bird robes.  Well, let's see how he answers the question.  What would take the lead in there?  Would it be a military situation?  Would it be Homeland Security?  It's a really interesting question.  And it's one that I raised that has created a little bit of consternation amongst some. 
[03:00:30]  I said that there may be a catastrophic event such that the federal government has got the...  It's only the federal government's got the capacity to move in quickly with a lot of resources,  which would require law changes.  For example, the military cannot become police without special proclamation.  And so we're planning all this out, right?  And we're in the midst of, one, identifying that there may be a problem, 
[03:01:00]  and, two, what to do about it.  And when I have a plan that I'm comfortable with, of course, I will talk to the American people about it.  I've got no plan.  He absolutely said nothing about that.  Who steps in if this country has a horrid medical crisis like the bird flu?  All of a sudden, hundreds of thousands of people are dying from this thing.  Who steps in?  Well, Al-Qaeda is out there with the bird flu, and we got... 
[03:01:30]  He doesn't know.  He doesn't know.  So, all the time that's been spent on one issue, regardless if you agree with it or not, the war,  all the time that's been spent on this, nothing else has been getting done.  Nothing.  Not even anything over there.  No, nothing.  Nothing is getting done.  All right.  That's an ongoing story, obviously.  Guys, are you ready to see Stalker Patty?  Speaking of birds. 
[03:02:00]  Here's the setup.  The Patty flu.  Stalker Patty was on.  You lose your tits.  The Maury Povich.  The Maury Povich show yesterday.  You get little tiny chiclet teeth.  And I guess you...  Hammer toes.  I guess you was part of a show.  Hairy nipples.  No, we don't have a plan to deal with this.  We'll shove it off to Maury Povich.  Maury took one of our ideas and did a show on old virgins, basically. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  And Stalker Patty was on the show yesterday.  And I guess they decided to give all these old virgins a makeover.  A makeover.  Yeah.  So we're going to see Stalker Patty for the first time now.  Now, we all remember what Patty looked like before the makeover, don't we?  Yeah, I guess.  All right, let's put the picture of Patty up there before the makeover.  There she is.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, what a mess.  We'll have like a before and after on the websites. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Hold on.  I'm just writing a note for everybody.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Just want to drag everyone into my world today.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  We all remember what Patty looked like before the makeover.  Well, I think we're going to see an entirely new Patty.  Let's bring out the new made-over sexy Patty.  Patty, if you would come in here.  Come on.  Here she comes.  Yeah, ladies.  Oh, my God. 
[03:03:30]  Where'd you get that? Out of the hamper? 
[03:04:00]  Wow.  Where do we be in?  You got to videotape from this angle, Danny, a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  It's cute when she laughs.  Well, there's always room for improvement.  Yes, there is, and there's still plenty.  Wow, that's some...  What is going on with the top of it, with the tit area of the dress? 
[03:04:30]  But then, like the bottom, your tits are folded in half.  How?  I don't wear them, so this is the first bra I've worn in, like, 25 years.  I didn't know you could, like, stuff fried eggs into a bra.  That's exactly what they look like.  I don't really have anything there to hold one up.  Her tits are folded in two.  They look like tumors with yarmulkes.  Well, they pinned the bra together to make me look like I have a little cleavage, which 
[03:05:00]  I don't have any to begin with.  Yeah.  You can make cleavage.  They pinned your bra together or your nipples?  No, and then they had me wear these falpsies things, too.  Wulpsies.  Yeah, I don't have those with me.  All right, stand up, Patty.  They took them back?  Yeah.  And pirouettes.  All right, do a little pirouette for us.  A pirouette?  A pirouette, not a purette.  Ew, ew, ew. 
[03:05:30]  I feel not good.  Ew.  They gave you one of those, like, ew.  What?  I don't know.  It's the skirt that looks really...  It's flirty.  If a girl has really nice legs and a nice ass, like, the back of the skirt goes up a little  bit, so you almost feel like you could peek at some stuff.  Yeah.  That's what Patty...  Turn around again.  Let's turn around.  Wait.  That's kind of cut up.  I can't really see it.  Yeah, move towards the door.  Move towards the door so we can see.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Don't worry.  There you go.  Okay.  No, it was just that the skirt was all bunched up.  Now, turn around. 
[03:06:00]  All right.  Do we have paper towels or something?  What?  Stuff the front of that.  Make boobs for her.  Yeah, we wanted to make boobs for her.  I can't even soak this in.  The bra is ridiculous.  Your tits are...  I am very small.  Yeah, but that's a lowercase egg.  You gotta put, like...  That's awful.  That is the word.  Just stuff the shit out of that.  Yeah.  Because, quite frankly, Betty Ford's got better tits than you.  I can't help what I was born with or what I wasn't born with.  Now, you look like one of those rare nine-year-olds that is blossoming. 
[03:06:30]  You look like sand in a dress.  No, leave them in there.  Stuff more.  Yes.  Stuff more.  Give yourself some tits.  Go ahead.  Big ones.  Keep going.  Stuff them higher.  Should I get 3,200?  3,200?  3,200?  I don't know.  Just keep stuffing.  Go ahead.  Could you put it higher?  You look like they're fucking, like, hip nodes.  Yeah.  Patty, just make it so there's no more wrinkles in the tit area of that dress.  Straighten it out.  Keep going.  Your boobs aren't that high.  I know they're not.  Patty, push. 
[03:07:00]  Patty.  Make it work.  You've done this before, right?  Oh, put it inside the bra.  In the bra, then.  Put it in the bra.  Look how much tissue she's using.  She's stuffing on the outside of the bra?  Yes.  No, I'm sorry.  I didn't.  You are.  Well, I don't know.  So now, Patty, you did the Maury Povich show.  Yes.  Keep stuffing.  What was the subject?  Keep stuffing.  What was the subject of the show?  Keep stuffing them.  Geeks and nerds.  Geeks and nerds, and, of course, you being a 50-year-old virgin.  I'm definitely a nerd.  A nerd.  Do they talk about you being a 50-year-old virgin? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, they did mention that.  She's even a 50-year-old virgin.  Well, you'll see it at the show when they air it.  Yeah.  They didn't tell me an air date yet.  All right.  And so you went on, and the...  I can't put any more in there.  You can so.  It's uncomfortable.  Come on.  You've been stuffing for an hour, and you still have A's.  It's not about your comfort.  Yeah, exactly.  It's about our joy.  Even stuffed.  Yeah, but anyway, you should have seen my before picture.  You know how I wear my pants up a little high? 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  And all that.  They're going to be a lot lower.  They really pulled them up high?  Yeah, they did, to exaggerate it.  Right.  But they're really going to be a lot lower from now on.  I'm buying new jeans.  Ah, you're buying the jeans.  Yeah.  All right, walk us through the whole Maury Povich experience.  She's ready to start walking.  Oh, my gosh.  She starts turning to walk.  Well, they treated me like a queen.  They gave me a...  They gave me...  We treat you like a queen, too.  Oh, I know.  They gave me...  I wish I could come up with that queen that got her head chopped off. 
[03:08:30]  I had such a good history joke, and I just flopped.  Marie Antoinette?  Yeah.  They gave me new glasses, a manicure and pedicure.  They had a limousine pick me up from where I work.  A limousine?  Wait, wait.  Like a...  What did they have to pick you up?  A limousine-type town car?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  A town car?  Everyone's talking.  Everyone's talking.  They picked you up in a town car?  What kind of car?  It was a beautiful, big, huge town car.  But what do they call that?  Well, a limousine-type town car.  Oh, okay.  Yes, a limousine.  A limousine.  A limousine. 
[03:09:00]  But anyway, well, it's a...  It's no better than your yamas, Opie.  My what?  Your yamas.  It's what?  Yeah, you were talking about...  What does that mean?  Well, you were talking about the alpacas, and you said they look like yamas.  What?  So I mispronounced words, too.  Wow.  Back at you.  But anyway, they picked me up...  I didn't say yamas.  What?  Yamas, you said.  It's llamas.  I know, but you said yamas.  No, I didn't.  But anyway, they picked me up, brought me to the studio. 
[03:09:30]  The lemonsine.  They treated me to lunch.  Oh, what'd you have?  Oh, I had a grilled cheese sandwich and some vegetables.  Way to go, Maury.  They really rolled out the red tampon.  Government cheese that they laid around.  It was wonderful.  They have the standing account with a couple restaurants and stuff.  What kind of vegetables?  You know, like, I don't know.  A medley?  Something with peppers and stuff.  Who did you eat with?  Oh, I ate with the other people that were also on the show.  On the show. 
[03:10:00]  In our green room.  Did you meet anybody that seemed nice, that you've made a friendship with, maybe?  Did you trade phone numbers, things like that?  Well, I have a, I'm going to get the email address of, you know, Joyce copied down the email address of a couple that we were talking to.  And what was their deal?  Well, she was trying to get him made up because he was like a computer geek and all that.  He actually even belongs to a website called geek.com where they sell things that geeks and all that. 
[03:10:30]  So she wanted to do him over.  Let me get geek.com.  Another one, her daughter brought her in.  And she's a 55-year-old librarian.  She dressed like she was 90 years old.  So she was like, you've got to do something, Mom.  So the daughter dragged her there and all.  Another one, her boyfriend dragged them in because he was tired of her looking like a nurse.  Right.  So you sat and had lunch with all these people?  Yes, I did.  And then we got the makeovers.  I went to the eyeglass place. 
[03:11:00]  They fit me with the glasses.  I went to the nail place.  Are those the new glasses?  Yes, they are.  They look exactly like the old glasses.  No, they don't.  They're smaller.  They don't have a frame.  Can I tell you right now, you should be wearing a New York shirt and signing Mark David Chapman's book.  Oh, stop.  You're funny, aren't you?  All right.  Look.  Is that from the Little House on the Prairie teacher collection?  Those are the worst glasses. 
[03:11:30]  They're like granny glasses.  I'm going to be honest.  I think those glasses are better.  I wouldn't notice the difference.  I don't have contacts.  I noticed the glasses.  I think they're a little better.  Can we see without glasses for a second?  I just want to see what you look like with contacts.  I don't want to.  Oh, wow.  How about some laser surgery?  Jesus.  On your neck with a lightsaber.  You know, but anyway, they put me up in the hotel overnight.  Oh, what hotel did you get to stay at?  81st Street in Columbus, the Excelsior. 
[03:12:00]  The Excelsior?  Yeah.  Was it nice?  It was an okay hotel.  Oh, boy.  They had Showtime, which I liked.  Well, that's a big selling point in New York City for a five-hour hotel.  Yeah, they're talking about nerd.  You want to hear the program that I ended with?  You should have got the suite.  They would have ESPN, too.  Punch it up there, Hawk.  Let's see how many stars the Excelsior gets.  Now, what were you saying there, Patty?  I ended up watching the life story of Albert Einstein before I went to sleep. 
[03:12:30]  Because stuff like that interests me.  Of course it does.  Holy shit.  So, now, you had to go out before your makeover, obviously.  Maury calls you out.  Yes, and I had to do the robot dance, you know, in my nerd clothes.  Holy shit, you're kidding.  Maury rocks.  Yeah, I didn't know.  This is why we love Maury.  Patty, please do the robot dance for us.  Are we filming this?  All right.  What kind of music was it?  Holy crap.  Wow. 
[03:13:00]  I am beside myself.  That's not how the robot dance goes.  Well, I don't know.  You're supposed to look stiff and everything, and everyone was enjoying it.  You look like you have cerebral palsy.  Everyone was enjoying it.  So, the audience, like, started to hoot and howl when you came out?  Yeah, they were, like, clapping and all, because I went into the dance and everything.  The robot.  Yeah, so then we went back.  It took about two and a half hours.  They cut my hair a little bit.  They said if I want it long, I've got to cut it every six weeks, or it's going to be scraggly. 
[03:13:30]  They said the ends were dead, so they had to cut it.  And then they curled it a little bit.  They said I had to use a round brush, you know, gave me little tips with the blow dryer.  Didn't give you brushes, though.  It gave you tips, though.  Yeah.  You've got to buy that shit yourself.  And then they highlighted your hair, I see?  Yes, they did.  They put in some subtle highlights, which go blend right in with my hair, you know.  And then they spent, like, an hour and a half with the hair, because I had to put the stuff in my hair, 
[03:14:00]  and then wait half an hour, and this and that, you know.  Uh-huh.  And then they did my makeup and everything, which I tried to copy this morning, you know.  Yeah.  Because I have my own little makeup kit home.  You do, a makeup kit.  Yeah.  You got that.  And what do you put on?  Some mascara?  Yeah.  And some rouge?  Yeah.  And some lipstick?  Yeah, and go with some pinks for the eyeshadow instead of the...  Usual blues.  Mm-hmm.  Do you have lipstick on?  A little bit. 
[03:14:30]  Cool.  Mm-hmm.  How are your lips chapped with lipstick?  Because it's cold.  It's starting to get cold.  Because it's cold!  I have to use a moisturizer, they said.  That's right.  What, your lips?  That's great.  Yeah.  Anthony, on the instant feedback that's now up and running again.  Yeah.  From the Punisher, location, Patty's ass.  Ope, you lying shit.  You are on bombs and flubs saying, uh, Yama, like it was Spanish.  Oh, really?  So I apologize.  Mm-hmm.  I did not know I said Yama instead of Lama. 
[03:15:00]  I still don't believe it.  You, sure you did.  You laughed after you said it.  Yeah, I sort of remember now, now that he's calling me out on it.  I don't buy it.  All right.  Well, that's fantastic.  Well, did Maury talk to you?  What did he say to you?  When is his show airing?  He was like...  Did they show videotape of you?  Yes, they did.  Oh, you got to see the whole show.  They shot me doing an interview with the producer.  You know, I was talking about how I enjoyed, instead of going out on a Saturday night, I'd  rather stay home and watch TV and do crossword puzzles and things. 
[03:15:30]  That's what you like doing.  Which I do, anyway.  I stay home and I do crossword puzzles and things.  That's what you do.  You know.  And then, like, so Maury calls you out.  You're all made over.  Yep.  Now you come out as the new Patty.  Yeah.  How did he introduce you?  Did he say, like, the new Patty or the new made over...  Well, he gave you some plugs.  He says, okay, you've heard of the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, we have Stalker Patty on the set or something like that.  Uh-huh.  He says, Patty, will you come out?  Because there's my before picture and everything. 
[03:16:00]  Right.  And that's Joyce looking at my before picture.  Now, she doesn't know anything of what I'm going to look like because...  Oh, well, what a surprise.  Yeah.  Wait, Joyce was on the stage with you?  Yeah, yeah.  She was the one that was supporting me like the others that supported me.  Right.  You need the friend that's there so they couldn't be shocked by the transformation.  Yeah.  The stunning transformation.  She didn't see anything they were doing to me in the meantime.  They keep them in an area by themselves.  Ah.  Yeah.  So they don't come into any contact with the person or loved ones.  To see such a stark change like the before and after of you. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Night and dusk.  Yeah.  But anyway, you're going to love the show.  It's like hilarious.  So now Maury calls you out and they must have played some upbeat music, right?  Yes, they did.  And he was like, whoa, look at that.  And then I was instructed by one of the producers, go up and give him a big hug.  So I did.  So you gave Maury a big hug.  Yes, I did.  And now what did Maury say to you after he punched you in the face and said, don't touch me again? 
[03:17:00]  He says, oh, okay, whatever.  Something like that.  I don't remember exactly what he said.  Did you hob his knob?  No.  And how was the audience reaction to the new Patty?  Yeah, they were like yelling and screaming.  The room came down.  Oh, unfortunately it didn't really.  The room came down.  The room came down.  I meant the roof came down because the noise was so loud.  No, you brought down the house, I think is it. 
[03:17:30]  And then they hollered even more.  And everybody in the audience got a free XM radio.  So they were bringing out baskets of the roadies.  Oh, everyone in the audience got a free XM radio.  Yeah, they got a roadie.  Well, that's just like Oprah.  They didn't quite have enough to go around.  So the last ten or so had to take addresses and names.  And they're going to get mailed their radio.  I mean, Voss should have went to that studio audience.  He could have finally gotten his.  Can I?  Do I have one, please, Maury?  I'm surprised he doesn't have one. 
[03:18:00]  Talking horses on the next Maury.  How would you like to do my show, Rich?  They show video of you in our studio?  Well, not that I saw that, that they filmed.  They filmed me being interviewed.  And they, you know, waving a lot and stuff, you know.  They had me do filming, you know, for the website, you know, there.  The producer loved me. 
[03:18:30]  But when the show airs, I don't know when it's going to air.  They're going to call me up and tell me.  They're going to kill you.  Yeah, so they'll probably call you, too.  Well, Maury's going to be in the day before your show airs with you.  Oh, okay.  That could be, who knows, maybe next week or November.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure you'll make it in the sweeps.  There's some great lines flying around today.  All right, anything else about your experience there, Stalker Patty?  No, it was the most fun I've ever had in my life.  Wow, even more fun than Colin's show when you did Tough Crowd? 
[03:19:00]  Well, that was fun, too.  You know, that was hilarious.  What about the time we shaved your head?  That was a lot of fun.  Eh, not real.  No.  Oofah.  All right.  You are a mess.  Well, congratulations, Patty.  It sounds like you had a good time at Maury Povich.  I had a great time.  You know, and thank you for putting me in contact with them.  Oh.  I really appreciate it.  Any potential dates?  Well, let's see what the future holds, but I'm more open to going out and hanging out with more people. 
[03:19:30]  Hopefully you and a cop with a piece of chalk outlining your body.  You know what?  Maybe the next time I take a bus ride down with a couple dollars to Atlantic City, I'll hang out at the bar and see if I meet anybody.  Ah, a dress like that?  What?  You're going to dress like that in a nice dress and sit at the bar in Atlantic City?  Maybe not a dress.  I might buy a sexy outfit, you know.  Well, what would you call that?  Isn't that considered a sexy outfit? 
[03:20:00]  It is, but, you know, it depends on what the weather is.  If it's cold, I get chilly, I have to, but I'll wear something really sexy.  Like what?  You can wear sexy jeans, you know.  Sexy jeans.  Yeah.  Like tights or your ass shows and maybe a belly shirt.  Make them a little lower, you know.  Oh.  You know, I just have to have a better choice in clothes.  That's all.  Yeah, is that what they told you?  Well, no, no.  But it's what I feel now, you know, that I really got to change the way I dress and everything. 
[03:20:30]  A skirt's so nice, Patty.  A short skirt or something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you know if Patty never looks at me?  She really hates me.  Yeah.  I don't.  I love you, Jimmy.  Okay.  Give Jimmy a hug.  A hug would be nice.  Of course.  There you go.  Aw.  Aw.  Grabbing that ass.  That's so nice.  Jimmy grabbed her ass, man.  Oh, God.  Oh, Patty, you look all right.  You look nice.  You look all right in the end there.  All right.  I can't help looking at these books.  Look at her.  She wants a book. 
[03:21:00]  That's her way of going, could I have a book?  Patty, would you like one of those everything you know about sex is wrong books?  I would like to borrow it.  I'll be happy to return it.  You don't have to return it at all.  You get to borrow it as long as you read a passage from the book.  Hawk, find a good passage for Patty to read.  As I'm sitting naked.  New Patty song.  What?  B.O.?  What?  Is it B.O., Jim?  Lilia.  Oh, Patty.  Patty.  Patty, Jimmy's saying you have B.O.  Patty, do you stink a little today? 
[03:21:30]  Get interned Bill.  I do not.  Bring in Bill.  Bill Sniffer.  I took a shower last night.  Yeah.  We want to know if Patty has B.O.  She has body odor?  You're going to have to sniff her a little on her underarm.  Stalker Patty, lift your arm up.  I might be a little nervous.  I don't know.  Smells like the VX agent from the movie The Rock.  When he smashes in there. 
[03:22:00]  It's disgusting.  How do you get a smell reference from a movie?  That's what I was smelling.  You got a brain tumor?  Smelling almonds.  Smelling almonds.  It smells like oranges.  It smells like oranges.  People who shine can notice.  Wait, what is it?  I don't know.  It's a terrible green.  I can't.  It's a burning.  Something burning.  Wait, get another sniff because you're a little confused.  Yeah, I think you're just having a stroke. 
[03:22:30]  Is it bad?  It's terrible.  Is it really bad?  Yeah.  Patty, did you use deodorant?  Yes, I did.  What do you use?  Well, last night.  What type of deodorant do you use?  Right guard.  And you used it last night?  After my shower.  I always do.  It could have been that I...  Right guard.  Well, it could have been that maybe I was a little hot or something.  Right guard stock plummeting.  Exactly.  You were hot.  Where did you sleep last night? 
[03:23:00]  Venus?  No.  It could have been I'm just a little hot in my throat or something.  Why don't you use like secrets?  It's strong enough for a man but made for a woman.  Right guard is like...  That's what's in every guy's locker at the gym.  Right guard.  Well, it was the least expensive.  How about something more feminine like Bruce?  Oh, spice.  When I can afford it, I prefer Tom's.  Tom's?  Because it's all natural.  Bill, you want to smell her snatch?  Check the check.  Old hippie.  No.  Yeah, check the other side.  It might just be the one side.  I don't want to. 
[03:23:30]  It might just be the one side, Bill.  It might be the other side.  Yeah, try the other side, Bill.  Just one more.  One more.  One more.  I'm sure it's fine, Patty.  I'm sure it's fine.  Lift that up.  Maybe she didn't have her glasses on and she picked up a wedge of cheddar cheese instead  of the right guard.  Do you think that she did that instead of a roll-on?  Do you use a roll-on or a spray?  I use a roll-on.  Maybe you rolled on some Gouda.  You know what?  Yesterday, my dad died a year ago yesterday and this is worse.  It's a worse day in October than that. 
[03:24:00]  Thank you.  Jeez, dude.  I'm sorry.  That normally happens tonight.  Sorry to hear that, by the way.  That's the only thing that happened.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Who saw that coming?  Wow.  All right.  I'm sorry to hear that, Bill.  That's okay.  No problem.  Oh, my God.  I'm embarrassed.  Well, who else wants to smell Patty?  No.  No, no.  Stop that.  Where's Sam?  Where's Sam?  Oh, please.  Where's Sam?  No.  Patty, you got the nice dress and the nice makeover happening.  You got to take care of the underarms.  Yeah.  Just use something like maybe some, you know, raid or just something like. 
[03:24:30]  Do you scrub the bush?  What?  You keep it nice and clean down there just to fix?  Wake me up when Patty takes a bath.  Well, I take a shower.  But you didn't shower today, right?  Yes.  I shower at night.  I shower at night.  I shower at that voice.  It goes right through you, doesn't it?  Patty, you got to work on your voice.  It's just this whining, screaming thing that's not even human sometimes.  What?  Is there anything that could be done for that? 
[03:25:00]  Has there ever been a voice makeover?  Maybe Poe could punch her in the throat.  Babe Ruth had one.  Yeah.  Jack Klugman.  Yeah, he had one in the worst way.  All right.  In studio, I am Sam.  Our old man.  How do you?  I'm Sam.  Hi, Sam.  Hi, Opie.  How's Syracuse?  It's good.  Is it true you're working for Scorch?  Yeah, I'm interning with Scorch.  Hey, you're interning with Scorch in the kingdom of nakedness.  Are you in the kingdom of nakedness with him?  It's the naked militia now.  Naked militia.  It's always something naked with Scorch.  No, we knew that.  I forgot. 
[03:25:30]  We love the Scorch.  It's the naked militia.  Do you have to get naked militia?  No, it's not required.  I think it's because it's theater of the mind.  It's the naked militia.  What does the naked militia do?  I don't know.  He uses the name, but he never really explains exactly why it is that it's the naked militia.  Yeah, that's Scorch.  He thinks it's the most brilliant idea ever, by the way.  Hey, naked militia.  Naked militia.  He describes the fans as militia members, and he's got his website where you can sign up  to be in the naked militia.  You want to be in the naked militia?  Sign up on the website.  I'm Scorch. 
[03:26:00]  I've never actually seen any nudity.  Do you guys at least make believe you're naked while the show's going on?  No, we never make any reference to it except when he says...  Does he call you naked Sam?  He just calls me Sam, Intern Sam.  Intern Sam, Intern Naked Sam, Naked militia.  How bad do you miss us, Sam?  I miss you guys.  I can imagine.  Is he doing any good bits up there, our old pal Scorch?  Actually, I was...  It's a no, by the way.  Is he doing douche or dressing?  Does he do douche or dressing?  No.  I was listening to the show yesterday, your show, and you guys were doing the G-Rock thing 
[03:26:30]  with Brain Cell.  Yeah.  That was one of their bits that they did at, what, 6.50 or whatever, and at about 6.45,  every morning, Scorch does the Brain Cell Stimulator.  Does Brain Cell Stimulator?  What is Brain Cell Stimulator?  It's a question, and what happens is it's a trivia question.  Uh-huh.  And maybe an innuendo, for instance.  I think today's that they had lined up was, in their average lifespan, a woman eats four 
[03:27:00]  to nine pounds of this, and then the listeners call up and they guess.  And of course they guess splooch, right?  Of course.  And then at 7.20, he comes back.  Hey, we're back.  And says it's salad dressing.  It was lipstick.  Ah, lipstick.  It was lipstick.  Hey, and we'll be back with more of the Kingdom of Nakedness and the Militia.  Okay, terrific.  Naked militia.  Wow, that's terrific.  To his credit, though, compared to the rest of Syracuse Radio, Scorch is probably... 
[03:27:30]  Scorch is tearing it up.  ...the best thing on Syracuse Radio.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, why don't you smell Stalker Patty's arm?  Yeah, we need a second opinion.  All right.  We could.  Patty, lift that arm up.  Don't be shy.  I'm talking about that.  Patty, lift the arm up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You put deodorant on last night?  Yeah.  You should do it in the morning.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Patty.  Yeah, you should probably do it in the morning.  You should be doing that a couple times in the morning.  That's all.  You know what it is?  I came in the rain and everything. 
[03:28:00]  I had to change my clothes.  My clothes.  You know.  What is she trying to fancy up that awful voice that's saying?  Are you trying to be Madonna?  I fancied up my clothes.  Maybe it could have been that I perspired a little bit.  Would you get dressed on a treadmill?  Stinky mess.  Did you carry a goat under each other?  No, because I don't normally have that.  Oh, I forgot to wear my cologne today.  You know, my spotty spray. 
[03:28:30]  What?  My body spray.  I have it from Avon.  I didn't put it on today.  I thought you had on a body spray.  What's the body spray?  Well, I got a Spiceberry.  I got a Sweet Honesty, which is my favorite.  I didn't put any of that on.  I should have.  And I didn't.  Could it please not scratch your back anymore?  No, I'm just nervous.  Yeah, I bet you are.  All right.  Perspiring.  You only did the left one.  The right one wasn't bad, I don't think.  Are you sure?  Yeah, try the right one there. 
[03:29:00]  Just to check.  You know, it could have been that I was sweating.  Yeah, you could have been sweating a little.  Lift that arm up.  Don't be shy.  Lift it up.  Lift it up.  I'm sorry, sir.  I think it's both, actually.  It is both.  It is both arms.  It's both arms.  Well, we got good news for Patty.  On the phone is Scott from Wisconsin.  Scott.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Patty.  What?  If I come to New York, would you let me eat your ass?  Because you are just totally arousing me.  I want to eat your ass.  Wow.  Would you let this guy eat your ass, Patty?  I don't think so. 
[03:29:30]  He's from Wisconsin.  That is the cheese steak.  They have no problem with odors.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Come on.  It might work.  Imagine what her ass crack smells like if her armpits are bad.  It's probably not like, it's probably just like a sweaty odor.  Because I don't think Patty's dirty.  I just think that she got a little nervous.  Yeah.  And maybe she was.  I want Jimmy to watch, too, when I eat her ass.  I would.  I'd watch her chew on.  Patty, you would still be a virgin if this guy ate your ass.  Yeah.  That's right.  Matt's never had Matt.  A lot of high school girls start with the, you know, getting their assy. 
[03:30:00]  You'd be squirming, giggling.  You'd be squirming and all excited.  Oh.  And it's not my thing.  Oh, eat my ass.  I never heard of that.  Never heard of it?  No.  Oh, it exists.  Hey, we got a big star on the line here.  We should get to here.  Andy.  Yeah.  Andy Milonakis.  What up?  How you doing?  Is that how you say your last name?  Yeah, Milonakis.  Milonakis.  I got peas on my head, but don't call me a... 
[03:30:30]  Peahead?  Word up.  I was watching his show.  Man, people either love you or fucking want to kill you.  I know, I know.  We're talking about your MTV show, of course, Sundays at 1030.  Word up.  I turned it on for the first time I watched it.  I turned it on, and I'm sitting there going,  what the fuck is this?  Like, what is this?  And I was so annoyed with it,  and then I just started laughing at you,  and by the end of the show, I was a fan. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, I'm not going to lie to you.  The first time you see the show, you're like,  what is this crap?  What is this idiot doing?  But thank God MTV runs their stuff about a hundred times  that you get a chance to actually see what it's all about.  I was laughing, and then I was pissed at myself for laughing,  and then I was just, you know, I figured, fuck it.  I just started laughing.  And it's really funny.  You're out of your mind.  You want to explain the show to people that might not have seen it yet?  First, am I allowed to talk to a friend, Drescher's retarded cousin?  You want to talk to her? 
[03:31:30]  No, not really.  She's annoying.  It's basically just a retarded show  where I act like a retard for 22 minutes.  You know, I started by doing these internet website videos  because I was bored out of my mind  from my regular computer job and shit.  So I just started making these weird videos,  and eventually it led to getting my own show.  And so it's just like weird sketch comedy things  with inanimate objects and like random people  from around the neighborhood,  like real people we find in the neighborhood. 
[03:32:00]  And, you know, we come out with like little bits  to do on the street.  He'll fuck with old people on the street, you know.  Just going up to old people,  and they're like,  hey, I can bet I can beat you in a race, bitch,  and then running away.  Yeah, and he runs away,  and the old person just left there bewildered.  Yeah, they usually don't know what's happening,  and then we give them the release to sign,  and they're just like,  what am I signing exactly?  And we're like, oh, no, it's okay.  You have to do this.  It's the law. 
[03:32:30]  You have to.  Old people.  Sign this.  It prevents cancer.  Ha!  Old people are so easy to bamboozle, aren't they?  Yeah, they are.  That's why they give their fortunes away to, like, Nigerian people.  How great is it when one of those fucking curmudgeons  is built out of everything?  I love reading that.  I lost my fortunes.  Shut up, Burton.  And the beauty of the show, of course,  is that you look like you're very young.  Yeah, I look like I'm four.  Yeah, what is that?  You look like you're what?  Like, call it 14, maybe? 
[03:33:00]  Probably about that.  At the oldest.  He looks about maybe 12 or 13.  12 or 13.  And how old are you, actually?  I'm actually 16.  Yeah, sure.  That's the big secret.  People are wondering if he's really only 15 or 16  or if he's pushing 30.  Wink, wink.  Nudge.  I know.  I looked at the Internet Movie Database  and I was like, whoa.  Really?  But that's the beauty of the show.  They really think he's, like, kind of a little kid.  I was reading an article on you  and you were, I think it was in L.A., Santa Monica, I think, 
[03:33:30]  and you were walking, holding some grown man's hand.  Oh, yeah, some Rolling Stone article.  Yeah, you know, we did this article and, I don't know.  I was just acting like a little bit of a retard,  as I do so often, you know.  Yeah, there he is.  Is your birthday January 30th?  It is, it is.  On the year of our bicentennial as a country?  What's that?  76.  No.  You weren't born in 76? 
[03:34:00]  Hell no.  That would make you, what, 31 or 32, 34?  29.  Or 29, 34.  I don't know.  That would make me 46.  No, wait a minute.  76, 86, 96, 2006.  Oh, my God.  Minus one.  Don't question my math.  It would be 30.  29.  You guys are getting me so erect right now.  So you're not 29, then?  No.  I might be.  I might be not.  I might be 15.  Yeah.  What do you got?  That goddamn Webster disease? 
[03:34:30]  What's the Webster disease?  I don't know.  His kidneys are all fucked.  He was black.  My kidneys are good.  Actually, I don't know how my kidneys are going to feel now.  You have that disease where security guards follow him in stores?  I'm just down to the NyQuil, and I got a toothache,  and I'm watching Pee-wee's Big Adventure,  and the plasma speakers are broken,  so I got reggae on in the background.  A little freaking out.  Andy, I haven't seen the show,  but a friend of mine is a really big fan.  Do you feel like,  because I know you started doing these crazy videos,  and all of a sudden things take off. 
[03:35:00]  Do you all of a sudden feel like a pressure?  Because if you're going to have something  that's originally thought out to be one way,  but then once corporate America kind of says,  well, this is it.  No, because, I mean, MTV, I mean,  maybe they do it with some shows,  but, like, since it's my show,  and they want to do a show, like, based on my stuff,  they're really, like, creatively,  they let me do a lot of the stuff I want to do.  Once in a while, they're like,  all right, this is too weird, you know what I mean?  Like, there's one bit where I did  where I just had lipstick rubbed all over my face, 
[03:35:30]  and I just keep saying,  I'm dead to the world, dead to the world,  and then it cuts to me looking like I'm swimming on my bed,  and me singing in a voiceover,  baby, you're beautiful, baby, you're fine,  baby, you're beautiful, yeah, yeah.  You want to choke him when he's doing things like this.  Can I point out how happy I am that your show is going  and Rich Voss's did not get picked up?  What are some of the other things  that you've done on the show there, Andy?  Well, I had little John spit-free pebbles in my face. 
[03:36:00]  I was going to have him spit them in my mouth  like a mother bird regurgitating to a baby bird,  but he didn't want to do that.  Do you blame him?  I guess I crossed the line of gayness.  I don't blame him at all,  and I was actually a little relieved that he didn't.  This guy's writing in on instant feedback,  says, my four-year-old daughter loves Andy,  probably because she has the attention span of a goldfish.  Yeah.  He probably has the personality of a goldfish, too. 
[03:36:30]  It moves pretty quick, your show,  from one thing to another.  How many sketches per show?  There's probably about 25, maybe.  Wow.  Yeah.  What do you tape that on, like a camcorder?  Yeah, we tape it on like a DV camera.  Yeah, it's pretty low budget.  Yeah.  That's probably why MTV likes it, too.  What does an episode cost you?  I don't know.  I mean, it's definitely considered low budget for TV,  but it's more than people expect.  I think it's like a couple hundred thousand.  Right.  No way.  Per episode? 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Stop it, it is not.  I swear.  I'm saying, no way, Jose.  Dude, we have tons and tons of people getting release forms,  the line producers.  Ah, those are interns.  You know, listen, no, they get paid.  And also, if we play,  if we have like a 10-second snippet  that has like a Snoop Dogg song,  we pay like $30,000, $40,000 just for the song.  Just for the song?  Yeah.  And you're probably pulling down a nice chunk of change, right?  Me, personally?  Yeah.  I mean, I guess for MTV standards, 
[03:37:30]  I'm getting paid pretty well.  I mean, I'm not making fucking friends money or anything,  but, you know, I'm making more than any other job.  It fills up the little piggy bank.  Yeah, and you're in the new movie Waiting, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It just came out on Friday.  Yeah.  Who's in that?  Ryan Reynolds, Justin Long, Anna Faris,  Luis Guzman.  Did you guys see it yet?  Luis Guzman, I happen to like.  He was in Q&A as well as Boogie Nights.  Yeah, yeah.  He's really cool.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, he's in like everything. 
[03:38:00]  It's like a really vulgar comedy  about waiters working in like a shitty chain restaurant  and they're just like unhappy with their life  and they take it out on the customers  and they have this whole penis showing game  where when they get you to show,  when they show their penis in different positions  and if the other cooks look at it,  you can sneak them in the ass.  Yeah.  Dane's in that too, right?  Yeah, Dane Cook is really funny.  What's Dane play?  He plays one of the cooks.  Is it getting good reviews?  Not really. 
[03:38:30]  I mean...  That's why I asked you.  That's the first person that's ever said that  when we asked him about a movie they're in.  Good for him.  Well, you know, I don't fucking sugarcoat shit.  Fuck it.  Were you bummed when the reviews came out  and they were bad?  Not at all.  I mean, it's a comedy based on really vulgar shit  about showing your dick to other waiters and stuff.  I think it's genuinely a funny movie  and when we see it in front of a crowd of people  they all laugh.  I don't care what some 50-year-old  balding child molester critic has to say. 
[03:39:00]  You know what I mean?  Fuck that.  I like the honesty.  The problem with 50-year-old balding child molesters?  What are they supposed to do?  I think they're hot, but you know.  No, but seriously,  I mean, that's a movie that critics are bound to hate.  So I don't know.  I mean, if it was like a drama  or something like Goodfellas  and critics bash it,  then maybe kind of like it holds a little more weight.  But like really vulgar comedies,  you know, I say fuck critics.  They usually bash them anyway.  You know what?  Now I'm going to go see the movie.  I wasn't going to see it,  but now after that I think I've got to go see it. 
[03:39:30]  There's no Bad Boy Bubby.  Yeah, you ever see Bad Boy Bubby?  No.  Oh, you've got to get that.  Andy, write it down.  Bad Boy Bubby.  The guy's fucking his mother and everything.  It's classic.  Is it kind of like Gummo?  I saw Gummo.  That was good.  This movie's going to sweep America.  I like the fact that in Gummo,  everybody always mentions that they pay  to have sex with this guy's retarded sister,  but they always fail to mention  that the money they make  to get to pay this kid 
[03:40:00]  to have sex with his retarded sister  is by killing cats,  drowning cats,  and selling them to a Chinese restaurant.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll have to check that out.  Do you read websites about yourself?  Yeah, sometimes.  Oh, you don't?  They just bash you really bad?  No.  I mean, like you guys said,  I mean, it's either like,  I love this guy  or I fucking hate this guy.  Oh, I know.  We know about the love.  We get that, too.  But do you read the hate thing?  Do you take it to heart?  Does it piss you off sometimes? 
[03:40:30]  No, I mean, usually it makes me laugh.  I mean, the first website I ever did  was one where I didn't even have video.  I just pretended to be a child actor  who couldn't afford head shots,  so I had different poses and stuff.  And, like, so many people bought it.  And, like, I'm just sitting there  reading guest book entries,  laughing my ass off  that these people are so retarded  that they believe it.  Because I wrote it in, like,  I wrote it like I was a retarded 10-year-old,  like, misspelled everything,  grammar, horrible.  Right.  And, like, all these people writing, like, 
[03:41:00]  you're never going to go anywhere, son.  You're never going to be an actor.  You're, the only commercial  I want to see you in  is one where you have  a concrete block chained to your neck  in a swimming pool.  All right.  Listen, we have 15 seconds left in the show.  Andy, thank you so much.  No problem.  It's Sundays at 10.30 on MTV,  the Andy Milonakis show, right?  Season two is coming soon.  Yeah, I'm writing it right now.  And a new movie waiting.  Good luck, bro.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Andy.  Stalker Patty, thank you.  We'll talk to you further about more.  Program complete. </pre>
