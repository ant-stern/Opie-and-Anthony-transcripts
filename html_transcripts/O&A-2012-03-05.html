<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the usual time announcement and the hosts' signature irreverent banter, with Anthony bragging about his lifestyle.  Sports news dominated early discussion, including the Knicks' loss, Deron Williams' basketball performance, and Tiger Woods' golf game. Opie detailed a weekend of heavy drinking and karaoke.  They then mocked a video of a woman praying to avoid a tornado, juxtaposing this with a somber discussion of the devastating Kentucky tornadoes and the death of a baby.  Criticism of a local news station's sports reporting and the rise of newspaper paywalls followed.

The conversation shifted to Kirk Cameron's conservative views, spurred by a story about Opie's college acquaintance who married him and seemingly abandoned her acting career. This led to a discussion about religious views on homosexuality, biblical accuracy, and free speech, even when offensive.  A substantial portion was dedicated to dissecting Rush Limbaugh's controversial comments about Sandra Fluke, debating the appropriateness of his language, his right to free speech, the advertisers' reactions, and the cost of birth control.  Caller Evan contributed to the birth control cost discussion.  The segment concluded with further debate on free speech, contrasting left and right reactions, and the hosts' responses to Vietnam War tapes provided by a friend.

The show continued with a vulgar discussion about birth control pills and condom use, focusing on the financial implications and women's reliability in taking birth control consistently.  They then engaged with Twitter user "Sheldon Mack," speculating on his identity.  Further criticism of Rush Limbaugh and perceived hypocrisy in Fox News and MSNBC coverage followed, escalating into an argument with Twitter critics and accusations of lacking facts, particularly regarding women's healthcare. The hosts also addressed criticism of their internet names and fact usage. The discussion moved to the power of advertisers, transitioning to the controversy surrounding DJs who called Whitney Houston a "crack hoe," followed by a sexually suggestive children's voice segment and a commemoration of John Belushi's death.  Dan Aykroyd's post-Ghostbusters career and a critique of the "My Girl" movie, particularly Macaulay Culkin's death scene, were also discussed.  A major segment detailed a heated internal conflict within the show's production team concerning food orders, involving accusations of favoritism, incompetence, "snitching" to management (Gary), and communication breakdowns between Sal, Kenny, Eric, and Travis. The hosts expressed frustration with management interference and their dislike for Gary.  The segment ended with further banter about coffee and listener "F-U" messages.

The show resumed with more "fuck you"s to a listener and mockery of another listener, Roy S., for his large iPhone attachment. They then discussed a 360-degree iPhone camera attachment from former intern Harry T. (referred to as a "lying sack of cunt" by Anthony), highlighting the poor video quality. A lengthy and profane discussion of John and Ken's suspension and sensitivity training after referring to Whitney Houston as a "crack hoe" followed.  Caller Lonnie from Southern California engaged in a heated argument with Anthony, accusing him of racism and using racial slurs, leading to a lengthy debate on the hosts' use of racial language and perspectives on racial issues.  This was followed by a jailhouse cooking segment with Bernard Hopkins and a brief interview with DMC from Run-DMC.

A significant portion focused on Kirk Cameron's views on homosexuality and abortion as discussed in an interview with Piers Morgan,  including Colin Quinn's tweets and Anthony's experiences blocking Twitter users.  A hate crime involving a teenager setting another boy on fire was mentioned, as well as a San Francisco earthquake.  A heated debate on abortion ethics, particularly in cases of rape, ensued, with strong opinions expressed and frequent use of offensive language.  The hosts shared opinions on Howard Stern and Piers Morgan, and Fezz's health was discussed.

The final segment featured a heated debate on abortion, focusing on when a fetus becomes human, with discussions referencing heartbeat and brain development, and employing graphic descriptions and humorous comparisons to tumors.  An internal conflict within the intern team, facilitated by Sam Roberts, involved Sal, Eric ("E-Rock"), and Kenny ("Club Soda Kenny"), who called in to resolve misunderstandings and accusations of lying over errand responsibilities.  The conflict ended with an on-air apology and a handshake. The show concluded with discussion of an upcoming anti-social comedy tour.

[00:03:30]  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What?  Where did we live with them?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He did a dang open, and he don't listen to a dang open.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it.  Morning.  Monday morning.  Come on. 
[00:04:30]  How you doing, everybody?  You notice he talks basketball, too?  No, no.  I think he customizes his greeting for everybody.  Right.  So after a while, he figures out what you're into, what you do, and then he talks to you  about it.  Like, I know he waits for Yankees for me.  Oh, no.  I was eavesdropping.  Oh.  He gets together with the rest of the boys, and they talk basketball.  Oh, I thought, like, he came and he goes, come on.  How about them Knicks?  Come on.  Well, he was shocked that the Knicks didn't win yesterday.  Right.  I don't know if he should be shocked.  The Knicks were behind most of the game and had to get a big comeback going, and then 
[00:05:00]  stupid Paul Pierce.  You saw the shot, right?  Yeah, that was a good shot.  Yeah, forcing it into overtime, and then the Knicks fell apart.  And Jeremy Lin had another just average game.  I still can't get in.  I still can't get in, though, because March Madness isn't over yet.  So, you know, brackets.  Brackets, brackets, brackets.  Well, here's the thing with Jeremy Lin.  They're still calling it Linsanity, this and that.  Linsanity. 
[00:05:30]  As he settles down to a better-than-average player right now.  He's just settling down, but they're still trying to push that Linsanity.  Like it's superstar, like Michael Jordan revisited.  Like it's still happening that first week or so.  Right now, it's just kind of becoming what it's going to be.  Yeah.  He's going to be a very good point guard for the Knicks.  Absolutely.  But he's not going to be in the same league as that Deron Williams from the New Jersey  Nets, who scored 57 points yesterday. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  Highest point total for the year.  And that stupid Rondo.  You don't want to hear this shit.  Sorry.  What?  Fucking Rondo just lit it up for the Celtics.  This guy's ridiculous.  He did something that most players have never done.  He had like a triple...  Triple bogey?  He had a triple bogey on the final hole.  Oh.  Yeah, fair enough.  I should shut up.  Triple bogey?  Fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  And Tiger Woods did a 62 yesterday. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, that's amazing.  Yeah, just when you totally forget about him, he does something that's pretty amazing.  Well, he didn't win the tournament, though.  No, no.  Rory McIlroy did it.  McIlroy.  Good old Rory McIlroy.  McIlroy.  Who is a little funny looking for a kid.  Yeah.  But he's now the number one ranked golfer in the world.  Yep.  And he's a young kid.  Back to the whites.  Back to the whites.  The title goes back to the whites.  So that's got to make you happy.  Yeah, you know.  Tiger hasn't been number one in a while now. 
[00:07:00]  No, no.  Back to the whites.  It's pretty terrible.  It was a good sports day, though.  Yeah.  What did you do yesterday?  Oh, no sports at all.  No?  No.  Yesterday was kind of a relaxed day because Friday and Saturday were taken up with a lot  of drinking, hanging out, compound shows, things like that.  I had a drunken compound karaoke Saturday.  I was drinking a lot of wine, so I even tweeted it.  My crap looked like fucking obsidian. 
[00:07:30]  It was like fucking black.  Really?  Black tar heroin.  Really?  But that's, yeah.  That was about it, though.  I stayed home.  Didn't do much.  I like home.  I love home.  You like just settling in, huh?  Yeah.  You know what?  And then I'm starting to look out at the pool because I know soon that's coming up.  And I got my little thing from the pool company saying, hey, opening time is right around the  corner, so, you know, fill out this shit so you can pay us.  When's the earliest you can open the pool up? 
[00:08:00]  But this year?  April?  I'm totally gunning on April 1st opening.  Holy crap.  Yes.  Start heating that water up.  Let's roll.  Is that too early, though?  Because you're insane.  I know.  I'm crazy like that.  But...  No, you're just insane in general, so...  Yeah, but it's not, though.  But April's all right?  I don't think it...  I think that is all right.  Well, did you talk to the pool people?  No.  So what are they telling you?  I don't care what they say.  Open the goddamn pool.  At least the jacuzzi could get heated up.  I think it's going to be in the 70s this week. 
[00:08:30]  Yes.  What the fuck happened, man, with this winter?  I'm not complaining, but something's got to hit us on the other side, man.  You think there's got to be some kind of repercussions?  Well, look at the tornadoes.  Yeah.  Is it even tornado season?  I don't think it's tornado season.  Not yet.  It's a little early for tornadoes, but they've had some whoppers down there.  They've killed quite a few people.  You hear about the one town that got hit twice in 10 months?  Oh, man.  10 months is just enough time. 
[00:09:00]  10 months.  10 months ago, a tornado comes through and destroys the whole fucking town, right?  They rebuilt like they do, and they got hit again.  That's just enough time to start really rebuilding and getting shit done, and then...  Getting it together.  It comes right back.  At that point, you've got to understand the Lord hates you.  Wow.  You know what?  There's a video of a lady using all her prayer stuff.  Oh, yeah?  Basically, the tornado's coming right for her house. 
[00:09:30]  Maybe we can find the video.  I should have tweeted you guys or emailed you guys, and she's trying to make the tornado  move away from her house.  Is she Gandalf?  You shall not pass!  Except a scepter.  It's close to that, but she's trying to will it away with prayer.  With prayer!  You can't petition the Lord with prayer.  You can't petition the fucking tornado with prayer.  You can't petition the Lord with prayer.  Is this it?  Oh, boy.  Is that it?  That's it. 
[00:10:00]  Take it away from us, Lord.  Oh, boy.  That sounds like Carrie.  Take it away from us, Jesus.  They'll see your dirty pillars.  She's speaking in tongues.  She's got the good shit.  Take yourself away from our home.  She's got the good prayer shit.  Take yourself away from our home.  Take yourself away from our home.  There it's more.  Take yourself away from our home.  Take yourself away from our home.  Take it away from this town.  Lord, you'll see.  It's coming right for her.  Take the Lord away from us. 
[00:10:30]  Take the Lord away from us.  I give you praise.  I give you glory.  Take this away from us.  Holy, I'm sorry.  You take this bottle away from us.  Armand Asante.  Father in the name of Jesus, you take this.  Lord, I am not afraid of you, Lord.  You know it.  I've got a ghoul.  Well, if you listen to the end of the video, you hear that she's off camera a little bit  because she's taken off because the tornado took the house.  The Lord wasn't listening.  The Lord was not even listening. 
[00:11:00]  The Lord was not listening.  And she had some of that hardcore prayers, yo.  Oh, yeah.  She knew like.  Speaking in tongues shit.  Speaking in tongues.  She was throwing some names in there that we never.  We know Jesus and stuff.  Right, right.  But she's throwing other names in there.  She had her hands up like she was trying to use a force push against the fucking tornado.  Well, the Lord created the tornado for whatever reason, right?  And then, you know, that's kind of selfish to go, look, Lord, don't take my house.  Take my neighbor's house.  Yeah, yeah.  That's kind of selfish.  Yeah, that tornado's got to go somewhere. 
[00:11:30]  She's pushing it away like a pinball machine.  Well, you should understand that the Lord developed the tornado.  Yeah.  Created the tornado.  And if you're a child of Jesus, you should just let it happen.  Because God.  Because it's God's will.  And he's not going to do anything wrong because he's pretty much infallible.  Right, of course.  So if he made the tornado, you sending it away is pretty pompous.  It really is.  But really.  It didn't work.  Have you ever wanted to see anybody killed by a tornado?  I've never wanted.  I've never rooted for someone to die in a tornado. 
[00:12:00]  This is the first time ever.  Go back to the last 10 seconds.  That was horrible.  Because you hear her voice is sort of fading because she's now getting the hell out of there.  But it did take the home?  That's what I heard.  If my info is wrong, please correct me.  It should have anyway.  Hit it.  I pray for you, Lord.  Take this away from us.  Holy, I shine.  You take this bottle away from us, Lord.  Father, in the name of Jesus, you take this.  Lord, I am not afraid of you.  Say, she's bailing. 
[00:12:30]  She's bailing.  As she walks backwards toward the root cellar.  And, uh, oh, fuck this.  See, I think we talked about it last week.  I don't know how you live in an area that has tornadoes all the time, man.  That's scary shit.  Tornadoes are scary.  You know what?  At least with a hurricane or something, you just know you...  You got time.  You got time.  You got two weeks time.  You got time.  With a tornado, it just comes down out of the sky.  You have no time.  They can't figure that out still.  It's literally a monster. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Just because it isn't a...  It's a sky monster.  It isn't a living, breathing thing.  It's...  It is a monster.  If you went to another...  If we didn't have tornadoes, and we went to, like, another planet and a tornado hit...  Yeah.  People would be, like, shooting at us.  Absolutely.  What is that thing?  And, you know, they can't really warn people too much.  No, they've gotten much better, but they still just drop out of nowhere.  Right.  Those are the ones that are just brutal.  I bet your helicopter rides through those are pretty bumpy. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, I bet.  They're pretty bumpy.  Which video is this one?  More tornado stuff.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, people are getting their tornado videos all over the internet, but...  That's one thing with the advent of the cell phone and things like that, with the cameras  and video on it.  You get a lot more video of things that happen, like tornadoes and whatnot.  You watch the news?  Because the news...  What?  Iraq?  You watch the news?  The news couldn't wait to announce that that baby died.  Oh, right.  And they are just fucking milking that and making sure we all get sad, even the people 
[00:14:00]  that don't like children and babies.  That one baby that survived?  That died.  You know what?  The whole family died, right?  That was the last survivor?  Yeah.  Would they find it, like, a mile away or some shit?  Something like that, but it survived.  Baby flying through the fucking air like that.  Yeah, what?  Flew out of the house, whatever, and ended up in a field, and everyone was like, oh, this  is the feel-good story around all this tragedy, and the baby died, and the news couldn't fucking  wait to go with it. 
[00:14:30]  Was it an F5?  Dropped my fork.  But it wasn't even a feel-good story.  It's like, the whole family is wiped out, and the kids all bludgeoned in the storm, and  that's a terrible story.  That's a sign that, what, God missed one?  He's fucking five for six?  He went for a recount and went, hey, wait a minute.  Yeah, exactly.  What happened here?  Yeah, and I had a sneaky little shithead, and I went back and killed it.  Lovely.  So that's just more tragedy for those people down there.  Tragedy. 
[00:15:00]  And quickly, to ABC local news here in New York, stop teasing sports scores, you idiots.  What?  Everyone was watching the Knicks and the Celtics that give a fuck about the Knicks and the  Celtics, right?  And then I turned on the news a little later, and they're, like, teasing, like, well, did  the Knicks, did Linsanity, did Linsanity continue in Boston?  We'll tell ya.  Ew.  I love that.  Ew.  But in this day and age, who doesn't know a sports score?  Yeah, if you've got a team you're keeping tabs on, you're gonna know what the score is. 
[00:15:30]  Well, how many people are possibly finding out for the first time that care...  From the news?  ...from the news that the Knicks lost to the Celtics?  Old people that are dying out, that don't know how to use any type of computer or computing  device.  Right.  Between phones and everything else.  And if you're not lucky to, you know, if you couldn't watch the game, of course, you're  gonna search out the score, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I think it was two hours later, like, you really think you're gonna keep people  stay in tune because they don't know who won? 
[00:16:00]  It's that.  It's newspapers.  I just heard about the newspapers.  I heard that, too.  It's like a lot of newspapers are now going behind that paywall.  I hate that, though.  You click on a link to get a story, and it's like, hey, register.  I would never go, and I'm thinking...  I was thinking the same thing.  It's like, do these news organizations realize people don't pay that?  Right.  It's like, who fucking would pay that?  I could get the info elsewhere.  Yeah.  I'll just Google the story I'm looking for.  It'll be somewhere else.  And it will be somewhere else for free. 
[00:16:30]  Aren't they making their money on the apps?  On advertising, they're not making any money.  No, the apps.  Like the paper apps.  Oh, I don't even know.  I don't know where they're making their money online.  Yeah, well, they're going for the pay thing, which is stupid, because I think that's just  going to allow some smaller places to pop up and become bigger news places.  Yeah, I just put the title of the story in Google, and I get it somewhere else for free.  I don't think you can make people pay for the news.  Especially online.  They're making you pay for their version of the news. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  Let's say it's the LA Times, or I think the stupid Newsday tries to make you pay.  Yeah, yeah.  Newsday's a horrible long-out paper, and they're trying to make you pay online for it.  I am fucking paying for that shit.  The internet, there's nothing that you have to pay for.  Right.  You can find it for free.  And I don't even mean bootlegging or anything like that.  Right.  Somewhere, information is there for free, and that's where I go.  Yeah.  Fuck, paying for it.  It sucks that they're not making money anymore.  No one's actually buying newspapers.  Well, that's just it.  We're in a phase where people got to figure out a new way to do things. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  You know, a new way to get some money coming in on these news organizations.  I don't know what that is.  I don't know.  Well, maybe like $50 million per subscriber, then you only need one.  Imagine.  That's a good platform.  Imagine you go to a board meeting, and you're like, I have an idea.  It's a brilliant idea.  One subscription, and we're set.  And then you just sit at a desk.  Waiting.  Day after day, waiting for that one phone call.  Staring at the phone.  But all you need is the one phone call. 
[00:18:00]  That's all you need.  Would you take that chance?  Oh, yeah.  With your business?  Oh, yeah.  Kentucky with the tornadoes.  I don't know.  Those people are fucking...  I don't know.  They're either stupid or really brave.  I think it comes down to this.  I've seen them in interviews, and I wouldn't say brave.  You wake up...  Wow.  You wake up as a human being.  I think you wake up as a human being around 12 years old, and then realize your surroundings  like, oh, I'm from Long Island.  Oh, my dad.  Oh, he's from... 
[00:18:30]  You got a bit of a history.  You start figuring everything out.  And I think what happens is these people don't leave because it's generational.  You don't want to be the first family to go, you know what?  This tornado shit's fucked up.  Let's move somewhere else.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of there.  I think they're stuck there.  Because I think we all think about it.  It's like, if you didn't have to worry about your close friends and extended family, why  wouldn't you move to a cooler place?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you? 
[00:19:00]  And it's true.  So, it's usually based on family, and you usually stay around the place that you were  raised.  Right.  Most people do.  And I think that's...  Sit at the local bar talking about your big football play in high school.  And I think that's the case in some of these tornado areas.  Why wouldn't they stick around, get the job at the mill that their grandfather and father  had?  You know, you get that good job for a good wage.  That's not a good job, man. 
[00:19:30]  That's not worth sticking around for.  Oh, lie to Rale Jim.  It really is a shit life.  That's terrible.  Fucking, you're just making ends meet, and your wife's still fat, and you gotta look  up and see God's wrath coming down on you.  And you're like, oh, how merciful.  At least date rape goes with impunity.  You could pretty much date rape in your local yokel neighborhood like that, and no one says  anything.  You gotta, yeah.  Yeah.  I suppose that they got three inches of snow after the tornado's tail. 
[00:20:00]  Wow.  And then flaming hail and a storm of frogs.  It's revelation every Tuesday.  No kidding.  What I would love to do is go to the local church this Sunday.  You know it's like barely standing, if standing at all, but they'll have service in a field  somewhere, right?  Oh, yeah.  And I want to talk to those people like, really?  People, people.  You're going to church still?  Gather around me, people.  I got something to say.  Yeah.  Are you really going to church still?  We're going to, you know, we're praying real hard, and we're going to rebuild this, and 
[00:20:30]  everything's going to be all right.  It's like, what?  No.  No, you gotta learn from experience and mistakes.  Whatever gets you by.  You know, who am I to say?  But the last thing I would be doing after a tornado that took out half my family in my  house was go to church anytime soon.  Mysterious ways, Opie.  You forget that mysterious ways thing.  You too.  Yeah, you too.  That's what I was talking about.  Love the you too.  He moves in mysterious ways.  I love it.  Yeah.  So that was one of the big stories that people are dealing with. 
[00:21:00]  Over to work.  Do you guys hear about Kirk Cameron?  Holy shit.  You want to go there?  This guy went.  Because we were talking about God.  He went that crazy route.  Yeah.  You know, he...  Why was Alan Thicke compelled to have to comment on him?  I was his television dad.  Oh, really?  That's what he said?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he's...  It's like, what?  People are looking for Alan Thicke for some kind of explanation.  Explanation as to why he raised a lunatic's television son.  Kirk Cameron's just a dick. 
[00:21:30]  He's a douchebag.  He's a fucking asshole.  And I'm slightly close to this because someone I knew pretty well in college married Kirk Cameron.  Oh, that's got to be a treat.  And she was the coolest broad.  And she was an actress and started...  She came down to New York.  She was doing really well.  And then she was on a whole bunch of stuff.  Matter of fact, she was on Cheers.  Yeah.  I think she got a little role in Seinfeld.  I think she did one of those Seinfeld shows where she was dating Jerry for half the episodes. 
[00:22:00]  She was one of those girls that was in a lot of shit.  And then she fucking ran into Kirk Cameron and disappeared and had eight kids for the fucking guy.  Oh, man.  And she said, what are you doing?  He said, nothing.  Like, all right.  She was in a lot of major shows.  Oh, so right.  I knew her pretty well in college.  I mean, I'm not going to say we kept touch or anything.  But back in that, you know, when I was in college, we certainly knew her and hung out a little bit.  She was in Cheers, Who's the Boss, Full House, Days of Our Lives. 
[00:22:30]  She had an ongoing stint.  Days?  Who did she play in Days?  Oh, do tell.  Do ditch.  Do ditch.  Yeah, she started in soap operas right out of college, I believe.  And then made Days of Our Lives.  She was on Days of Our Lives for a long time.  Then went into Growing Pains.  She was on there for a while.  Oh, that's how she probably met him.  Wow, she's fucking hot.  She did an episode of...  You have no idea.  Yeah, that's an older picture of her, man.  She's lovely.  I mean, a newer picture, I should say.  I'd switch...  You know what?  I'll bet you she fucked the heathen right out of him. 
[00:23:00]  He was probably not even...  He was an atheist, wasn't he?  Yeah, and then religion.  She fucked God into his life.  Was he an atheist?  I think he went from atheism to, like, I don't know if it's evangelical or much more hardcore Christian.  So maybe she brought the God in him.  Yeah.  This girl was beautiful.  I don't know what she looks like now.  She carried God in that vessel vagina of hers.  Believe me, if she put her vag on my face, I'd badmouth the gay thing.  He's four, why not?  Her vag was the holy grail.  He drank from it.  What a douche he is.  Yeah, these are newer pictures. 
[00:23:30]  You gotta see when she was younger, man.  Holy fuck.  She's beautiful, though.  She's still beautiful.  Don't get me wrong.  How many kids did she have for Kirk Cameron?  I feel like we should get a Geneseo crew gathering and try to fucking rescue her.  Then again, did Piers Morgan ask him?  Got the clip so we can find out.  As much as I don't like what he said, and I think he's a twat, he does have the right to his opinion.  Just like Miss America, you can't penalize somebody because you ask them for their opinion and they offer an opinion you don't like. 
[00:24:00]  That you don't like, exactly.  There's a difference between that and going on an anti-gay rant.  Yeah.  So I would like to hear how it got brought up.  By the way, I even have a little more respect for him being such a hardcore Christian, not bending the rules.  If you're going to go the Christian route, you can't be like Christians for homosexuality.  If you're going to go that whole thing about how God doesn't like homosexuals and this, that, then you gotta take it the full limit.  I don't know.  I think, and again, I'm no... 
[00:24:30]  How do you change religious rules?  I'm no Bible scholar.  I think only once in Leviticus, they mention...  Yo, Leviticus!  ...man laying with another man.  Yeah.  I think that's only mentioned once.  I think there are other things mentioned, and that's why I heard somebody arguing that point,  that the anti-gay religious people are harping on like one thing in the Bible,  and there's other things that are mentioned way more than that.  Yeah, yeah.  So somebody could maybe...  I'm sure there's people listening out there that don't know what I'm talking about.  But I think I saw the same show you saw on that, to tell you the truth. 
[00:25:00]  It was called Gays Rule.  I mentioned once in the Bible.  Right.  It was the name of the show.  Was the gay thing in the Bible kind of vague that's been interpreted?  No, I said, man shall not lay with another man.  I think...  I don't know what else it could be interpreted as.  But even if it did say that...  Man did not lay with another man.  I think, yeah.  I think he actually...  Carl actually...  I gotta correct myself.  She had three kids with Kirk Cameron and then adopted one.  I heard over the years that it was a lot more, but I am wrong.  Because wasn't the Bible made up from a bunch of stories, collected, popular religious teachings 
[00:25:30]  that they voted on 300 years after Christ died?  No, they found out...  It was actually Mad Libs.  The original Mad Libs.  He washed whose feet?  Leper!  All right, put Leper in there.  Leper!  That's hilarious!  Let me read it back to you now.  And there was a lot of other shit that was written.  Yeah, yes.  They kind of took the best stuff and put it in the Bible.  I want to read that other shit.  Because maybe there's some stuff in that.  The Bible needed an editor.  Oh.  That had to be edited.  Anything about women in the Bible?  Like, they said that, you know...  Again, I've heard Mary Magdalene was very... 
[00:26:00]  A part of Christ's ministry and teachings, but she just got written off as a hooker  because they didn't put a lot of her stuff in the Bible.  Yo, hooker!  But you had a...  I just thought I was preaching great to you.  Well, what's creepy about religion, back then it had so many more writings.  And then the people that had influence when this was all being put together,  they decided which ones were going to be the stories and the writings and the teachings.  They voted on them.  That's scary to me.  I would love to read the whole body. 
[00:26:30]  The original director's cut?  Why not?  Yeah.  Why not?  I bet you there's some stuff in there that might explain a few things here and there.  A canon or a canonized...  And I don't know enough about it.  I've learned too sporadically about it.  But that's why when I look at the Bible...  The pirates shoot at each other's boats and stuff.  What's that?  A canon?  That looks pretty good.  I got a pretty good at it.  So maybe...  Oh, go ahead.  No, see, that's why when they tell me the Bible is the word of God.  It's just like, what did you wait so long to get it out for, you literal asses? 
[00:27:00]  Oh, really?  It drives me nuts.  Yeah, think about that.  It drives me nuts.  Yeah, we're...  My opinion, we're way off on what religion is really about.  I think it's been fucked up.  Too much man hands in there, in the soup.  I would love to see the whole religion thing in its purest form.  What is that?  That's the question.  It's love, man!  Oh, shut up.  But that is the question, because it's been fucked with for so many...  Yeah.  Well, a couple thousand years, certainly, right? 
[00:27:30]  Twisted around for man's own fucking convenience and device.  With that, Kirk Cameron's a dick.  Yeah, he is a...  In my opinion.  Yeah, he's a douche.  And you know what?  He should be able to say whatever the hell he wants, by the way.  Don't be fooled.  Rush Limbaugh, by the way, should absolutely be allowed to say what he did.  What?  He said something bad?  We'll get into that.  But everyone was asking me all weekend long.  I'm like, he should be allowed to say whatever the fuck he wants.  Of course he should.  Yes.  Especially because he's not a news show. 
[00:28:00]  I think, Jimmy, you might have mentioned that over the weekend, or somebody else talking  Yeah, it's not the news.  It's not the news.  Rush Limbaugh's not the news officially.  It's an entertainment show.  It's entertainment.  A lot of people didn't like what Rush said, but you should fucking defend his right to  say it.  Wake up, people.  Especially broadcasters.  It's amazing that there's any broadcaster out there that comes out for anybody's firing  or anything like that.  That is the old there, but for the grace of God.  Go high.  Who is saying that?  Broadcaster.  Me.  Well, besides media matters. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They target him.  But what about other broadcasters?  Are they saying, yeah, he should be fired?  I don't hear them defending him.  Every one on the left.  Yeah.  Every broadcaster on the left.  That's how funny we are.  Nobody defends the opposing.  Like, what he said was kind of, eh, it wasn't pleasant.  It was inappropriate.  Right.  And not nice.  But he has the right to say that.  Of course.  That's just basic shit that people got to understand.  Whether you're just a guy listening to the show right now or if you're a fellow broadcaster.  Or a broad listening to the show as well.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  And if that woman's going to testify before Congress, hey, good for her.  But you can't testify before Congress in a public setting and not expect some people to say things about you that you don't like.  Especially for the subject matter.  If he just came out and called her a slut because she's talking about, you know, wanting to raise more money for children or something.  But if she's saying she needs three G's for birth control, calling her a slut is not out of the fucking realm of comedy and talk radio fair.  You know?  She, well, now we're into it. 
[00:29:30]  So we'll get back to the Kirk County.  Three grand on birth control?  Well, what does she mean by that?  I don't know.  No one needs three grand for birth control.  When I was growing up and doing some fucking, some of that fucking.  Right.  I had some condoms around the house.  The occasional pregnancy test.  But that's what I'm saying.  How much is three grand worth of?  Three grand.  What does that entail?  I think I heard a show where that works out to fucking three times a day every day. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  Well, that's ridiculous.  For a year.  And if that's the case, then you're a slut.  But why did she say it that way?  Why would she say three grand for birth control?  Trying to get people to understand that it's very costly and the insurance companies need  to, if she just came on and said, yeah, it's like a hundred bucks a year.  People would be like, ah, fuck you.  Three grand sounds like a lot to a college student.  See, I don't know how I feel about that.  I'm in the middle on it because a part of me is like, the result of people having kids  that they don't want costs me more in the end. 
[00:30:30]  It costs me more money.  So, yeah, morally, fuck them.  But, hey, I don't want to pay for it.  It's like, hey, if you want to fuck all that, go ahead.  But make the guy put a rubber on, stupid.  Right.  Like, why should we have to pay because you don't want to tell a guy to put a rubber on  his dick?  And by the way, I don't agree with that.  Me neither.  Yuck.  That's for sure.  But why should I pay for that?  But please, break down the number.  I mean, obviously, she didn't mean it literally that she needs $3,000.  No, she did.  She probably did.  She did.  She's testifying before Congress. 
[00:31:00]  She loves Congress.  She needed a number, and she said $3,000 a year on birth control.  That would be pills, perhaps pills plus the condom and a dental dam and a fucking IUD.  I'm a little out of this story, to be honest with you.  So, did she realize she fucked up with her number?  Did she have a...  She doesn't think she fucked up.  She still doesn't think she fucked up.  No, she loves $3,000 worth of birth control.  Oh, then what the fuck?  Then Rush should say what he said.  Exactly.  That's why he said it.  He didn't just pull that out of nowhere.  Like I said, he should be able to say it no matter what. 
[00:31:30]  Exactly.  But he's not that off base then.  Yeah.  I thought she might have fucked up her number and then came out after the fact and said,  I guess I didn't do my math properly.  Three large.  Three large?  Yeah.  Crazy, right?  Nah, come on.  Are you...  No, that's exactly what she said.  Wow.  Wow.  And she's sticking to it.  All right.  Well, this is Rush...  Do we have his apology?  He didn't do that.  No, it was written.  Just a written apology.  Excellence in broadcasting. 
[00:32:00]  Waddle Doodle.  I apologize.  By the way, fake apology, obviously.  Yeah.  Because he was feeling the heat.  And these cowardly advertisers run.  Well, that's the sad part.  Oh, I know.  The advertisers run these programs now, not the government.  Well, at least a lot of people...  Rush has a lot of people that enjoy him.  Right.  And they're coming forward and saying that they're going to start boycotting the companies that pull sponsorships.  Finally!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Somebody fucking does that!  Yeah.  A few others have said that over the years, to be completely honest with you. 
[00:32:30]  But Rush does have a rabid fucking audience that will make a noise.  But I would love to see it actually make a noise.  So would I.  Because that would help all broadcasters.  Yes!  And there's people out there that had to get a hold of me that are like,  Can't wait for you guys to defend Rush Limbaugh!  Yeah, and?  Well, this is how you defend him.  Because, yeah, it's America, you idiots.  Rush should be able to say whatever the fuck he wants.  And the advertisers should fucking relax.  And they shouldn't have as much power as they do. 
[00:33:00]  So if his listeners fight back a little bit and hurt an advertiser or two, that's going to fucking even the playing field.  Where's all you phony liberals out there?  This is why the liberals drive me crazy.  How about you phony motherfuckers defend Rush even though you don't like him?  Because what he said was unpleasant.  And maybe it wasn't very nice.  But it was absolutely not something he should get in trouble for.  Right.  Where's all the phony people sticking up for this guy's right to say something they don't like or agree with?  I love how quickly people are willing to say, you know, I don't agree with it, but I'll defend his right to say it. 
[00:33:30]  They won't even fucking defend the right to say it when nothing is at risk.  There's no way she's getting three penises a day.  Look at her.  I think she's representing people.  I think she's more the representative.  I don't think any...  She looks like a fan.  Yeah.  She should be lucky if she gets three a month.  I don't think...  Not three a day.  I don't think she's getting a lot of what they call the dick. 
[00:34:00]  Someone said we don't understand how birth control works.  Really?  Oh, yeah?  How?  Evan, even...  Mighty Moe.  Who's this?  Evan?  All right.  What's up, Evan?  Just a couple of things.  It's like...  It's not like condoms.  When a woman just takes a birth control pill once a day.  I mean, I don't know the issue with the cost.  But they just take them once a day.  So it doesn't matter how much sex you have.  If you take one pill, you can have sex a hundred times.  No, no.  You're absolutely right.  But the point is, why wouldn't she pay for that? 
[00:34:30]  And if she doesn't have the money for that, why should I pay for it instead of her making  a guy wear a rubber?  Yeah, there's other options, you know.  I think...  I think...  Yeah, I agree with that.  I think there's a couple of things.  One is that birth control isn't only used for preventing babies.  It's also...  Oh, it is preventing babies.  But I mean, it's for like...  You know, people have like severe acne, a lot of cancer, you know, like certain medications.  Like you take hormonal...  Yes.  You know, the stuff is the pill.  The pill, yeah.  And so it's a lot of like saving of cost if you have people preventing pregnancies where 
[00:35:00]  you're going to have some damaged baby or whatever.  No, I do...  Can I interrupt?  Because I...  Not to jump on what you're saying.  I agree with you.  It can work.  Because I had an ex that would take it just because of her mood swings.  And certain birth controls actually balanced her out.  But so she was only kind of a cunt and not a complete one.  So it can help there.  But this woman was talking about, I think, just for preventing pregnancy.  Like not because it was...  No, no, no.  That's not true, Jimmy.  Okay.  Well, she gave testimony in Congress about some other friend of hers who like lost 
[00:35:30]  an ovary because she had some whatever condition it was.  I don't even know.  Okay, Evan, it doesn't matter.  Lippitis?  Okay, maybe I'm off to the afternoon.  Well, let me jump in.  It doesn't matter why the woman is taking the birth control.  The fact is, it's not $3,000 a year.  We did some quick math.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I don't know.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Shut the fuck up.  God, I don't have these conversations in my regular life.  No.  People know when to shut the fuck up.  I'm trying to help.  I can't see you.  I'm just trying to...  But then the average person will go, holy fuck, he's a little irritated because I'm 
[00:36:00]  speaking over him, so maybe I'll just shut up for a minute.  But what does this guy do?  Well, he can't see you.  Yeah, got it.  Evan, I like you.  Please.  All I wanted to say was we did some quick math here.  Evan?  Please, God, let me talk.  We did some quick math, and we think it's about $600 a year, not $3,000.  My point being, it doesn't matter what they're using.  $1,600.  No, that's for three years.  Three years. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, I knocked it down.  I did a third of that.  Oh.  So it's up to $600 a year.  So it doesn't matter what they're using the birth control for.  It's still only $600 a year.  Yeah, I know nothing about that, the cost issue.  Hey, one other thing.  That's why, Jack.  You know, he was calling that phony liberals?  Yes.  You know, it's fine if Rush wants to say it.  In terms of this and Lynn and everything else where people are getting all heated up because,  you know, there's a backlash, it uses the marketplace at work.  You know, it's like the liberals have the right to speak up. 
[00:37:00]  It's Rush's risk if he wants to say what he wants.  No, no, no, but let me ask you a question.  And you're right.  That's the argument every person uses when they want to find a reason to penalize you  for saying something they don't like.  Let the market dictate.  So how about this?  When people speak out against gay marriage, you know, why do liberals come and defend  gay people's right to get married?  You know, it's – I'm tripping on myself here. 
[00:37:30]  I know what you mean, though.  Yeah.  That's the argument people use when they want to penalize you for saying something that  they don't like.  I don't necessarily disagree with let the market dictate, by the way.  But the problem is that no one, you know, will try to protect their favorite radio shows.  How's my dictate?  We're at a big disadvantage.  The people out there have got to fucking wake up and realize how much power these advertisers  do have, and they got to push back.  Meaning if you said I'm for gay marriage, that's what I'm trying to say. 
[00:38:00]  If you said I'm for gay marriage, and you were going to be penalized for that, like  your company was going to get rid of you for saying that, the left, the liberals would  come out of the woodwork to defend your right to say that.  And they'd be right to defend you.  But because you're saying something that's not pleasant or that they don't like, they  fucking sit there and they're happy to see them get in trouble.  They're absolute phonies.  Well, you know, you guys are right about that.  I guess I was getting back to the issue of Lynn.  I mean, it's like, you can understand why the NBA, if they're trying to, you know, to  make a ton of money in Asia, they're trying to tamp down any kind of shit relating to 
[00:38:30]  people talking about Asians and cutting off that market.  That's why, that's why a lot of that shit gets, you know, cut off.  And that's why there's the big cure.  I mean, you know, of course, there's a political thing, too.  But you can understand why ESPN or MSG or any of these other companies or the NBA as  a whole is trying to tamp that shit down.  They got to allow them to do it.  What?  What is he doing?  He's saying that it's a financial decision they're making where if you say something  about anti-Lynn, hey, it's an Asian slam.  They're trying to tap the Asian market.  Okay, I get that.  That's a stretch, I think. 
[00:39:00]  I really do.  Then just say that they're doing that.  Right.  Instead of coming out and being arbitrary with, you get more in trouble for this one than  that one.  Right, right.  I agree.  I don't want to re-get it to all that stuff.  It went on for a week with you guys.  I don't want to.  I know.  Someone else is saying that it is $3,000 for uninsured people.  For three years, Sam is saying.  Three years?  So did she fuck up by saying $3,000 for a year?  Maybe.  No, she said three years.  Three years.  Oh, for the whole college.  She said $3,000 for three years.  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't know about that.  So what's.  Fuck her.  The prices.  For three years.  I still don't want to pay for it. 
[00:39:30]  Wait a minute.  So.  Do you want to pay for her fucking birth control?  Planned Parenthood, you can get birth control for like $1,600 to $1,800.  That's where those numbers are coming from for three years.  She said contraception for three years was $3,000.  So there's still $1,400.  $1,200 to $1,400 difference between what Planned Parenthood is saying and what she said.  I got you.  Right.  Gotcha.  There's the booze you got to buy so you can get fucked.  That's true.  The motel rooms.  That's it.  And the every once in a while abortion. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  The old oopsie.  I forgot to take my pill.  Could you drive me to the abortion clinic?  Yes.  How did he call her a prostitute?  That to me is like, geez, you set yourself off a lawsuit.  Because she's asking for money in order to have sex.  Oh, okay.  That was like, that was the analogy.  It's a, it's a stretch.  It's like, you know, he wasn't literally calling her a prostitute.  Okay.  But she's up there saying, hey, in order to have sex, I need you to pay me.  So.  Well, when this shit comes up, though, the right and the left should be defending. 
[00:40:30]  And they don't.  Drives me nuts.  I'm defending.  This right and left shit.  Ah, you're defending.  I'm defending.  Your own right to speak.  Jesus Christ.  And a lot of people are wondering why Rush didn't get fired, but Imus did get fired.  Imus got fired from his TV show.  Imus never got fired from his radio show.  Is that true?  I don't think they should get fired.  No, he got fired from radio.  What did he do?  He got TV first.  He just, he didn't get fired from, uh, radio.  He's still on ABC. 
[00:41:00]  No, he got.  Oh, he went from, uh, the fan.  Yeah, he went from the fan.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he got fired.  TV first.  Did he?  All right.  And then radio.  Did he get fired from all his markets?  Yes, he did.  Yeah.  Oh my God, I forgot.  Yeah, he got canned.  And then he came back on.  Because I'm obsessed with what MSNBC did to the guy.  Oh yeah, CBS fucked him too.  You're fucking right.  Shit.  Okay.  And a lot of people thought that that was a move, by the way, by MSNBC to fuck CBS.  Because once they fired him, CBS would have to.  Well then, to answer the question, Rush is way more powerful than Imus was when Imus was in his situation. 
[00:41:30]  But even Rush, when the advertisers go, they would eventually fire Rush.  But somebody would pick him up and Clear Channel would, it would be such a drastic mistake.  And they probably said, look, this is going to be a mess.  And he just, maybe he agreed, okay, I'll write a statement.  Right.  And it wasn't a groveling statement.  It wasn't, I read a lot worse than that.  Yeah, it's fake apology because he felt the heat, period.  But then the dummies out there go, oh, you apologized.  Okay.  All right.  But I would be that person going, no, I know it's a fake apology.  Fake, fake, totally fake.  He doesn't care.  It's all confusing now. 
[00:42:00]  Yes.  And why is Obama, I think Rush raised the point, why is Obama, the president, calling this woman,  now he's doing the commencement speech in her college?  Oh, God.  And it's like, a great point, did he give Bill Maher back the money?  Because Bill Maher was calling Sarah Palin a cunt.  Which, again, it's fine.  She's running for office.  He could say that.  But where was the outrage over that?  You're never going to find it.  It's just, it's such fucking phony indignation.  Yeah.  It drives me nuts.  Yep.  Evan, thank you.  Thank you.  Bye, Evan.  All right.  I'm sorry I yelled at you. 
[00:42:30]  I'm not.  I'm sorry, though.  You deserved it.  I'm going to build that bridge today.  We're good.  Me and Evan are good.  I'll respect the liberals a lot more when they fucking start defending people who are  saying shit that doesn't completely go hand in hand with what they like.  All right.  It's got it.  You phonies.  Yeah, that's the problem with this country.  I want to like them.  I really do.  I really, I want to be a fucking liberal.  I want to be a flaming left.  Well, I shouldn't say like, I want to be a very, a big lefty.  You do? 
[00:43:00]  I really do.  You and Weez could hang out.  I agree with them so much on so many things, but with the language and speech, I fucking  hate them.  And they're as bad as the conservatives.  Yeah.  You guys had a good debate on Friday, you and Weez.  I love Weez.  But he's a liberal I like because he's not a language policeman.  You got it.  I didn't bring it in today yet.  Weez gave me some Vietnam tapes.  Holy fuck.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  He was like, he had a little mini recorder his friends gave him or I don't know how it  came about.  And he was talking about the war and sending him home. 
[00:43:30]  Wow.  And I got like, I got a good solid 20 minutes.  He's talking about burning villages and piling up the dead bodies and why they're not banging  the broads in Vietnam because they all have black teeth.  Holy shit.  And he goes, yeah, man, you know, he's like, he's like 19 or 20 at the time.  Weez is in his 60s now.  So this is 40 some odd years ago.  He still have that voice back then?  You can totally tell it's him, right?  It is coming.  And he admits that, you know, anytime we could just, you know, we could grab one of these 
[00:44:00]  women in the woods, but why would you want to?  They have black teeth.  Wow.  Talking about getting laid, talking about drugs, talking about fucking dead bodies, talking  about burning a village.  Like real Vietnam shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, that's fucked up.  I didn't bring it in today, but maybe tomorrow we could play some of it.  I'd love to hear that.  Because, I mean, it's like 20 minutes, but it's worth it.  And the quality is okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, every once in a while you don't understand, but in general you get the gist of what's  going on.  That's pretty cool.  It's pretty fucked up, man.  Yeah.  And I asked him, we went to dinner, I'm like, are you attached to that guy at all? 
[00:44:30]  Because I was listening to the tapes all afternoon, and then I happened to go to dinner with him,  and he goes, it's like a movie, he says.  Like there's no connection to that anymore in his mind.  He knows it was him, but he can't wrap his head around it anymore, because it's 40 some  odd years ago.  He goes, it's like watching a movie, you know?  So, here's what Rush said about Sandra Fluke.  We kind of did this backwards, by the way, but that's okay. 
[00:45:00]  What does it say about the college co-ed, Susan Fluke?  Susan.  Who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to  have sex.  What does that make her?  It makes her a slut, right?  It makes her a prostitute.  She wants to be paid to have sex. 
[00:45:30]  She's having so much sex, she can't afford the contraception.  She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.  What does that make us?  We're the pimps.  No, Park, you pause that.  The Johns.  I hate that.  There you go.  Okay, he corrected the Johns, because the pimp doesn't pay, you dumb rush.  Right.  How do you learn your hooker 101 lingo?  That's right.  We would be the Johns.  No!  We're not the Johns.  Well, yeah.  We're not having sex with her. 
[00:46:00]  Well, that's his point.  Pimp's not the right word.  No.  Okay, so she's not a slut.  She's round-heeled.  I take it back.  Hey.  Wait, he took it back at the end?  Yeah, what happened there?  They kind of took it back at the end.  I haven't heard that part.  They haven't been saying the part where he took it back.  They're in the same fucking...  They seem to cut that part out.  They probably had to call her and fucking talk to her.  You know, just to take that seriously and take that in the context of if he was a newsman reporting that she's a prostitute and a slut. 
[00:46:30]  But no, that was just him talking, using figurative speech about the fact that she wants to get paid for birth control to have sex.  You know, you kind of make that leap.  And then you call her a slut and a prostitute, but not literally.  And anyone who can't understand what he was saying is a fucking idiot or has an agenda.  And I guarantee when Rush was saying all that, the last thought on his mind was that that was going to be a problem. 
[00:47:00]  That's going to be a problem.  That's what radio...  Radio's so weird.  Like, if you went through a hundred hours of Rush Limbaugh tapes, you probably would find stuff as bad as this.  Oh, every day.  And I use that in quotes because I don't think any of this is bad if you're doing a radio show.  Or worse.  Or worse.  But all of a sudden, one day, they decide, you know what?  Nah, we're going to take that clip and we're going to fucking run with it.  And you heard it in context.  You just heard it in context.  When you listen to the news, it's like, and Rush Limbaugh calling this woman a slut? 
[00:47:30]  Right.  And they make it sound like he was, you know, ragging and going on and on about what a slut she is.  And then they make...  No.  And then they make their edits because they don't have time.  For some reason, it's such an important story, but they don't have time to play the whole clip.  No.  Because they have to get to the Knicks score that everyone already knows about.  Because the actual clip, the facts, don't make the good enough story.  In the end, he kind of took it back.  He did.  He was like, oh, okay.  What?  She's not.  Unbelievable.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Unbelievable.  Fucking people.  Yeah.  We got a girl who wants to pipe in on the birth control thing.  It's Tara.  What's up, Tara?  Not much.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Hi.  Yo.  I was just calling because, well, I defend Rush's right to say whatever he wants.  I'm a big advocate of free speech.  I do still have a problem with the fact that people always seem to have this issue with birth  control when it comes to it being subsidized by insurance companies. 
[00:48:30]  And Sam's right.  Birth control is cheaper at Planned Parenthood.  That's because the cost of it is subsidized by the federal government, which is another thing  that everybody seems up in arms about at times.  And to be honest, if Viagra is subsidized by the birth control, I'm sure Rush would be  glad to support Oxy being subsidized by, you know, insurance companies.  Can I ask you a question, though?  Can I ask you a question?  And it's just, I'm for birth control.  But when you think about it, if there's an option for her just to make a guy wear a  condom, why should anybody be forced to pay for that instead of her just making a guy 
[00:49:00]  wear a condom?  Well, condoms aren't 100% foolproof.  It's always good to have two methods of birth control.  Besides the fact unwanted pregnancies can be far more expensive on the taxpayer.  No, no, no.  But I understand that.  I understand that.  But forget the taxpayers.  I'm talking about why shouldn't she be forced to make a guy wear a bag or double bag it?  I would assume if you're a girl, though, you could control the whole situation if you're 
[00:49:30]  getting your birth control pills and not assuming that the guy isn't going to fucking do what  we've heard on this show, pull it off in the middle, or maybe it's a condom that's been  in his wallet for three years.  You don't even know if it fucking works anymore.  I say ass.  But I'm just saying, at least from a woman's point of view, I could see where you probably  would want complete control of that.  Right up the shitter.  She ain't getting pregnant that way.  Right?  You girls got to give up that asshole.  Swallow jizz.  Give up that ass. 
[00:50:00]  A jizz.  Well, if it was a pill that existed that prevented a man from getting a woman pregnant, that would  probably be subsidized by the insurance companies, and I doubt people would have a problem with  it.  The bottom line is you can look at it as anti-woman when the reality is, why can't you just make  a guy put a condom on?  Why not do both?  Well, why not just make him put...  Well, isn't it...  Jenny, why is it such a different issue?  Because it's a medication that has to do with contraception. 
[00:50:30]  No, no, it's not.  It's a religious argument that's different.  Like, if people have views about religious issues, I can understand that to an extent.  I don't agree with it, but I understand it.  But when it comes to, as a medication, what makes this different than any other medication?  I'll tell you what makes it different, because I'm not looking at it as a medication.  I'm not looking at it when people are taking it to treat or balance certain depressions.  I'm looking at it when it's used as birth control, and believe me, I'm for it.  And I think it's a great thing to use.  But if you're going to have sex, why should other people be forced to pay for it when the 
[00:51:00]  option is make a guy put on a condom?  And you can say, well, why not do both?  Well, if you can afford both, you do both.  But if you can't...  Because I don't think you see a tremendous amount of people getting pregnant from...  If you make a guy put on two condoms...  Yeah, but the condom's not a guarantee.  Neither is the pill.  Because women miss their pill.  I think the odds are better if you're controlling those.  I think it's what's important to some of the women out there.  Women are terrible with taking those things on time and shit. 
[00:51:30]  And honestly, I want women taking birth control pills.  I do, too.  Fuck, you don't want more unwanted kids out there.  We have enough of them already.  Nothing better than shooting that one.  Sheldon Mack, who...  Might have been that shit.  She either hates us or loves...  I don't know what this broad's about.  Oh, she...  Yeah, yeah.  She spews a lot of fucking hate on Twitter, but she listens every day.  I think it's a guy, by the way.  Is it?  I don't believe that's...  I don't believe it's a woman, either.  It's not a woman.  She goes, Opie, you can't be this stupid.  Oh, my God.  This woman was not talking about herself.  I know that.  She was talking about women's health care in general.  Right.  I know that. 
[00:52:00]  Anything else, Tara?  That's it.  You guys have a wonderful day.  All right.  Thank you, Tara.  All right.  Good call, I guess.  Was it a good call, Sam?  That was a good call, right?  I think so, yeah.  So Russia's feeling the heat.  They just played his clip again.  Of course they did.  Of course the media's going to...  And not one of these frauds will stick up for him.  Not one of them.  What about Fox News?  What are they doing with this whole thing?  I honestly don't know.  Because that's where you need to look.  I haven't watched the news all weekend. 
[00:52:30]  Well, Fox News can't ignore this.  Are they defending him?  What are they saying?  I think they would assume Fox News would defend him.  They report.  You decide, Opie.  That's what I think.  Oh, brother.  Trickery.  What?  That's trickery.  They report.  You decide.  You decide if you want to watch me on Red Eye and Hannity on the 16th.  Nice.  Wow, you're doing both?  Yes.  How are you pulling that off?  One right after another.  Boom, boom, boom.  Very nice.  That's how we roll now.  Very good. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  So they don't have an agenda over there?  They report, you decide?  They report, you decide.  Okay.  It's not that lean forward bullshit that's going on in MSNBC, that's for sure.  Well, they might lean a little forward, certainly.  Lean forward.  Oh, God.  Lean forward into the guillotine, you fucking pieces of shit.  Hate them.  Lean forward.  Lean forward.  Oh, really?  You're that fucking...  They're so pompous, they literally think that they're leaning forward.  They don't lean left.  We're leaning forward. 
[00:53:30]  Shut up, you lefty.  I'm faking it, trying to fake it.  You guys, even hearing yourselves, love your show, but you're sounding like a bunch of  douches right now.  Well, why...  Again, the Twitter...  Instead of the Twitter people, why don't they just call up?  I don't know.  Why are we sounding like douches?  And then that Sheldon Mack is just out of her mind, or he, whatever.  Why wouldn't you block that?  I blocked that thing the first time I read what that thing said.  I blocked it.  Which one?  Because it doesn't bother me.  I'm reading her shit. 
[00:54:00]  This is why Opie and Anthony are full of fucking shit.  Fucking get some facts, you idiots.  That's why I blocked it.  I think we got some facts by going on the phones today.  Women take the pill for many, many things.  We said that.  It's part of her fucking health care.  What is wrong with you morons?  No, she was not.  Whatever.  I don't know what that means.  It's expensive because it costs a lot, and it's for many, many reasons.  Google, blah, blah, blah.  You woman-hating fuckwads.  I think we got all these facts out, by the way.  I'm a woman-fucking-hate-wad, by the way, so just shut up. 
[00:54:30]  We love women.  It's a lot different.  You people are going to make me late for work.  Jimmy, you're tripping on your words because what you're saying is fucking stupid.  Don't read me what she says about me.  I blocked that fucking phony man under a woman's name.  It is a man.  You're a man.  Yep.  Fucking another internet fucking pussy using a fake name.  You think it's a man?  I know it is.  I know it is.  It's not a woman.  That's weird to have a sexy fucking black avatar lady.  Of course.  It doesn't come off like a woman. 
[00:55:00]  That makes it strange.  It.  That it doesn't come off like a woman.  Ah, whatever.  We're just discussing this shit.  People get all up in arms.  They get all fucking crazy when you discuss stuff.  To dumb it down, I'll say it again.  I think Rush should be able to say whatever the hell he wants on his radio show.  But unfortunately, that's not the case in this day and age because the advertisers, the advertisers,  you know, showed some anger and then Rush had to, you know, do the fake apology to kind of like calm everyone down. 
[00:55:30]  Ridiculous.  But I hope Rush Limbaugh's listeners, if they really believe that he has the right to say whatever he wants.  Yeah, they boycott the fucking sponsors.  We'll push back in a way where it's a little noticeable because that'll help everybody in the end because the advertisers have way too much power these days.  Yep.  I mean, there are radio stations and companies that used to tell the advertiser, go screw.  We're defending our guy.  It's like, oh, there's somebody else to take their place. 
[00:56:00]  No problem.  That went away, what, maybe 10 years ago at this point?  Yeah.  Oh, the good old days.  That's me dumbing it down.  That's all I'm saying.  Oh.  You know, he's a blowhard Rush at times.  But even in that clip, in the end, he kind of took it back.  Yeah, he was like, oh, okay.  Right.  We do that all the time here.  You just bring something up, you go off on a tear, and then you're like, oh, maybe not.  Right, right, right.  You know?  Right.  It's a goof.  It's a goofy thing to do.  All right.  We'll get back to Kirk Cameron. 
[00:56:30]  I'm Piers Morgan.  We've got another couple of DJs that were in trouble, and they have to do something.  Oh, my gosh.  There's plenty of fun stuff in the air.  This story, by the way, bothers me way more than the Rush line.  I know.  Oh, God.  Way more.  Oh, I know.  Wait till you hear what the guys out there in L.A. have to do, because they called Whitney  Houston a crack hoe.  They got in trouble for calling Whitney Houston a crack hoe.  Are you kidding me?  Please.  We'll explain next. 
[00:57:00]  The Opinette Richel.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  On SiriusXM.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  Don't touch me like that.  Don't touch me like that.

[00:59:30]  SiriusXM, you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question.  33 years ago today, Belushi died.  Thanks, A-Rock.  Now you can fade that out.  I ain't playing that fucking crap today.  Getting topical crap.  Can I have... 
[01:00:00]  You know what?  Really fast.  Belushi was found dead 30 years ago.  He would have...  You kidding?  I was telling Dan, if he was alive today, he would only be 63.  Yeah.  That's pretty crazy.  That's so young.  I'm still getting tweets from people that I think they're the first people telling me.  Hey, did you hear?  Belushi died.  This fucking Twitter wannabe first guy.  I didn't want to do the bit today, but I wanted to just talk about Belushi for just a couple minutes.  Can you imagine the movies he would have made if he didn't fucking do what he did? 
[01:00:30]  Who knows?  Although there was a drop-off, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He might have just ended up in that whole Dan Aykroyd area.  You know?  I don't know.  What was the last good thing Aykroyd did?  Could you even think about that?  Dr. Detroit?  Is that even good?  No.  It's terrible.  You gotta go Ghostbusters, right?  Gotta go Ghostbusters.  You probably gotta go back to Ghostbusters. 
[01:01:00]  After Ghostbusters, you can do this quick.  Spies Like Us?  Ghostbusters 2.  Ghostbusters 2 is...  All right.  Nothing But Trouble.  Nothing But Trouble.  No, I don't think so.  Love the cover.  Uh, The Best of the Blues Brothers, Coneheads.  Oh, God, no.  Blues Brothers 2000.  Extreme Ghostbusters.  Blues Brothers, Ghostbusters.  It's just all...  Blues Brothers and Ghostbusters.  Ghostbusters shit.  You see all those different titles for Ghostbusters?  Yeah.  What's Extreme Ghostbusters? 
[01:01:30]  Or was it Extreme Blues Brothers?  I got confused there.  No, it was Extreme Ghostbusters.  They revamped the series.  What does that mean, though?  What's Extreme about it?  Well, it's the new generation.  Extreme's the cartoon.  Right.  Yeah.  It's an extreme cartoon.  All right.  Who's in Driving Miss Daisy.  So?  Who's in My Girl.  So?  That's My Girl.  My Girl.  That was a nice pick-her-upper movie.  Yeah, exactly.  That was a nice happy fucking movie.  Kid crying over her dead little childhood sweetheart plate to a guy. 
[01:02:00]  And he died from bee stings.  Yeah.  Hollywood should understand that most people don't want to see a movie about a kid dying.  No.  They've really got to understand their audience.  She's crying with a cough in there.  I'm just watching this going, ah!  Why is this entertaining?  Horrible.  It's unbelievable.  Terrible movie.  Didn't she run back upstairs?  Because not only did she have to go to the funeral of her best friend, they decided  to have it in their house.  Yeah, in the house.  So now the living room is going to be a horror show every time she walks through it. 
[01:02:30]  Because I do remember the scene.  Didn't she run upstairs crying after she saw the body or something?  Of course.  She tried to say some words about him and got all choked up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it was terrible.  Oh, good.  You got it?  I was crazy.  Oh, no.  She comes down the stairs.  Yeah.  Which movie is this?  This is My Girl.  Little Macaulay Culkin is dead.  Oh, that's what makes me cry.  It's my Uncle Paul.  It's what fucked up Macaulay Culkin, I think, because they decided he needed to do more dramatic  roles.  Now she's looking in the room from the staircase at a dead Macaulay Culkin. 
[01:03:00]  Her little pal.  Take her upstairs.  In her fucking house, by the way.  Yeah.  Comfort her.  Why would they have the funeral in the house?  That's what I was just saying.  Oh, that's probably just so fucking they could get her to watch without bringing her to a funeral  home.  I think because it wasn't...  No, Ackroyd was one of the guys that, like, bombed people.  I don't know.  I have no fucking idea.  So now she walks up to the coffin.  There's an open casket with Macaulay Culkin dead.  Who the fuck would sit through this and enjoy it? 
[01:03:30]  And now...  Before he left that place.  She's very, very fresh.  Back to your room.  She's crawling in the coffin like a black mother.  Yeah.  His face hurts.  And where is his glasses?  He can't see without his glasses.  Hey, he's dead.  Who the fuck would enjoy this?  Put out his glasses.  I just think it's bad that she's misbehaving at the funeral.  He's gone, sweetheart.  He's gone.  How awkward would that be to be in Matt Romo? 
[01:04:00]  Sorry, my daughter's such a cunt.  And then she just storms out of the place.  What a bad girl.  Oh, man.  And then runs horribly, by the way.  But how come no one told her that dead bodies don't need glasses?  Ah, because she's dumb.  What a dummy.  Where's his glasses?  For what?  What's he reading?  It's going to be dark in there anyway.  Once they slam that lid shut.  Exactly.  Are you going to get him a flashlight, too?  Yeah.  Maybe we should get him some LASIK surgery before we fucking involve him. 
[01:04:30]  The point being, why would Hollywood think that's a great idea for a fucking movie?  People love those heart-wrenching, tear-jerking, fucking...  I like a good sad movie, though.  I like a good sad movie.  If you read anything about this movie, it was a big mistake for everybody.  No one liked this movie.  They're like, what the fuck are you doing?  And it kind of fucked up Macaulay Culkin's career after that.  Because now people are like, oh, fuck, we saw him dead.  Yeah.  Now I don't want to see the fun Macaulay Culkin anymore.  What was that other one where he was the...  Was it the bad... 
[01:05:00]  The bad son.  The good son.  The good son.  The good son.  That was another where they were just trying to change him.  He should have just been what he was.  Little Elisha Wood was in that one, too.  Sorry to interrupt the show.  E-Rock, can I please have the banana and the low-fat cottage cheese that I usually get?  Thanks.  Yeah.  It's a new system.  It's a great system, by the way.  Yeah.  Jimmy's not happy about the new system that we just became aware of.  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  What happened?  Apparently...  We should discuss this.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  From now on, when I want food, I'm not allowed to text... 
[01:05:30]  That's what I normally do.  I usually just text Kenny and he'll talk to you.  That's what I would do, yeah.  He would ask Sal to get it, because Sal was the guy that we trusted and he wouldn't fuck  it up.  But I don't know what happened behind the scenes, but now Kenny's not allowed to ask the interns,  because I guess Sal didn't like going, only be the only going, so now we have to go through  E-Rock, and then somebody went and told Gary, and Gary came down.  So I'd love to know who snitched to Gary, and who went to Gary.  E-Rock, what do you know?  Why do people have to drag those guys into anything that happens here?  I don't get it.  I don't know.  Can't we just handle it internally amongst the show members? 
[01:06:00]  Well...  We don't want Gary involved in anything.  So I want to know who went and ratted to Gary.  I don't know why Sam's laughing.  These are facts.  Why is it funny?  Because he runs the channel.  But he's proven time and time again that we don't want him involved.  He just makes things more complicated.  More layers of shit.  It's funny.  Why is it funny?  It's real.  I know it's real.  That's why it's so funny.  That's why it's so funny.  It's not make-believe that he's important to us.  What do you got, E-Rock?  Well, Sal was doing a lot of work here for the show, production-wise and what have you. 
[01:06:30]  But he was also being the go-to guy for going and getting coffee, breakfast, all that other stuff.  When we got some other interns in here who were perfectly capable of doing so and not screwing up the food orders, they weren't being used.  So Sal got upset that he was in the middle of projects for Troy, for us, and stuff on the air.  And the other interns weren't allowed to be going and getting your food and whatnot. 
[01:07:00]  So he complained.  He talked to me.  And I spoke with Kenny.  Past that point, Sal spoke with Travis about this same issue.  And then from there, it was out of my hands.  Who went and ratted to Gary?  That I don't know, because I didn't speak to Gary.  What happened?  Well, who did?  Why would anybody bring...  I'm not even shitting on Gary.  But that's not necessary.  No.  Well, the problem was, is that Kenny just wouldn't let any of the other interns... 
[01:07:30]  The reason Kenny wouldn't let other interns, honestly, here's why.  Because we've had a history of interns fucking up our food.  And it sucks.  Every time we have interns who fuck the food up, and then you usually find one guy that you trust to do that, who does it right.  For them, it's nothing.  But for us, it's on air.  I want someone who's not going to fuck my food up and who I kind of trust to handle it.  It's not the most complicated shit.  But how many bits have we done on guys who just are incompetent and retarded and can't get the fucking food right?  Can't get it right.  Right, and it's a timing issue also, because when the food gets here and it's right, we know that an hour goes by, it's break time. 
[01:08:00]  The worst thing is when it fucks up, and then the food gets here, and you're in the middle of the show, and it gets cold, or we're eating on the air.  It's just...  It's got to work like clockwork.  Did we try the new guys, though, before we realized they were incompetent?  We did after the fact, and they've been fine getting your food, getting your coffee.  Okay, so who went to Gary?  What was the purpose of that? 
[01:08:30]  Fucking snitching to Gary.  Travis, what do you know?  Anyone?  Anyone?  I know.  I know that.  That's the only reason I'm asking.  Well, look, I mean, you know, all I heard was that Sal was getting really frustrated being the only person to go out.  He went to Eric, because Eric's his intern boss, and I know that Eric spoke with Kenny,  and then I know that it continued to happen, and Sal was frustrated that he was going out five times in a row without other interns going out at all. 
[01:09:00]  And, you know, we have new guys who are completely capable.  Nobody's had any problems with these new guys.  Oh, boy.  I'm not asking that.  I understand that.  I'm asking who went to Gary.  I went to Gary.  Oh, shit!  Why?  Because the situation was not being taken care of on Eric's end.  Eric did what he was asked to do, which was speak to Kenny. 
[01:09:30]  I am not in charge of the interns because of things.  So it goes from Eric to Gary.  I am not involved at all.  Okay.  So then why would you go to Gary and not Eric going to him?  Not that that matters, but I'm just curious.  That's just what I did.  Okay.  I had no... 
[01:10:00]  Terrific.  Good.  Okay.  Just curious.  What's the issue, though?  No issue whatsoever.  None.  None.  I was just curious.  Okay.  So now I'll just order from you, E-Rock, because...  Good.  No, that's not what you have to do.  You can keep doing what you were doing.  I'm not texting Kenny.  Why would I?  That's how I do it on the air.  I just text him when I want something, and he has somebody go and get it. 
[01:10:30]  It's just...  Whatever.  And it's been working for the last, like, three weeks, right?  Yeah, it's been fine.  Right.  And this has been going on for the last three weeks.  Okay.  So there's no reason...  Then it's a good thing you went to Gary and got it straightened out.  Excellent.  Okay.  I guess we would have just let it continue.  Or handle it yourself.  We tried to handle it ourself.  Did Kenny muscle you or grab you?  No, I didn't have anything to do with Kenny, because, like I said, this is not my department. 
[01:11:00]  Like, this doesn't concern me, and I've been told...  Kenny, did you ignore what E-Rock told you?  No, Travis just said we tried to handle ourself.  Could he just expound on that a little?  Eric.  Eric tried.  Right.  Sorry.  Not me.  Eric, what happened?  Sal was frustrated that he had to do all the getting of food, right?  Yeah.  So then you went to Kenny and said what?  And I spoke with Kenny.  And Kenny had expressed to me that he likes Sal doing that job. 
[01:11:30]  He didn't want to...  You know, he didn't know the other guys.  He didn't want your food and everything screwed up.  And I had talked to Kenny.  I said, look, they haven't even really tried it, but they followed Sal.  They know the routine.  They know the orders.  We can start using these other guys.  A couple days go by, and then Sal comes to me again.  The other guys are still not being sent.  So I have, from that point on...  Kenny, why did you ignore that?  Eric, let me refresh your recollection.  Okay.  Wouldn't it be more correct to say that the morning you told me about this nonsense, 
[01:12:00]  all right, I adhere to what you said, all right?  And maybe, Travis, I'll refresh your recollection also, all right?  Because not a few minutes after that, Jim wanted his second cup of coffee, okay?  And...  This makes me sound very needy.  I gave my credit card to Travis.  And Travis, isn't it correct that you sent Sal for the coffee that morning? 
[01:12:30]  That is correct.  Okay.  And not an hour after that happened, I'm getting a talking to.  I know.  By Gary.  Oof.  And then I went to Eric, and I asked Eric who the little tattletale snitch was,  and Eric, who did you tell me it was?  I told you that Sal had talked to me, and Sal was the one complaining about this.  No.  I asked you who was the tattletale snitch to Gary, and who did you say it was? 
[01:13:00]  I don't know.  You're not going to get around...  No, you do know, Eric.  Hold on, hold on.  You're not going to get around this, because Kenny was a detective.  I'm not trying to.  You're making it worse.  Just answer his question.  I'm trying to here.  He's not going to...  I know you're trying to, but don't try.  Just do it.  You know the answer.  You said it already.  Wait, you're asking who went to Gary, and Travis went to Gary.  No, no, no, no, no, listen. 
[01:13:30]  Don't try to fucking deflect and convolute this thing.  I'm not.  You understand perfectly.  All right?  After I got my talking to, I asked you who the little fucking cheese eater was,  and who did you tell me it was?  1955?  55?  What?  You're saying I did?  Eric, all right?  Stop playing stupid.  You're not that dumb.  Kenny, I don't care about any of this.  I'm trying to work with you here on this.  If you don't care, then just tell the truth. 
[01:14:00]  You don't want to say, because the guy's standing right next to you.  I said so early, and you said no.  Was that E-Rock?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Sounded like a girl.  Look, I'm not trying to cause a fucking problem here.  I tried to defuse everything, because this is bullshit over who gets your food.  I've seen interns fuck shit up, and I know these other two guys that we have here wouldn't  have been a problem, because they're not idiots.  Hold on.  Let's stop right there.  I like this version of E-Rock.  I'm not trying to fuck with Kenny in any amount. 
[01:14:30]  Wouldn't it be fair to say, Eric, that when the new interns started going for the talent  food, they made mistakes?  I don't.  Well, they didn't have napkins or something.  It was something really small.  Okay, that was one mistake.  In Kenny's world, that's a big mistake, by the way.  Okay.  Just so people know.  Well, then, you know what, Kenny?  I don't remember the other mistake.  No, you do remember.  You just don't want to say.  No napkins?  No, because I don't think about this stuff.  What, they came back with no napkins?  Don't we have napkins around here, though? 
[01:15:00]  Or we have paper towels, and that's not good enough?  No, they'll suffice, but we need napkins.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  And what was the second one?  I don't know.  It was probably like there wasn't a spoon or a cup of ice didn't have a lid on it or  something.  But the bottom line is, they made mistakes.  That's why one intern who had a position of honor and trust turned out to be a little  crybaby.  Where's Sal today?  Sal's in here.  Sal, get on mic, man. 
[01:15:30]  Come here.  Explain from your point.  You want him in there or here?  No, no, no.  Keep him in there.  Sal, stay here.  No, I don't care.  I was just fucking around.  All right.  Go in.  B-Rock.  I just want to hear in Sal's words what was going on.  He's coming.  Okay.  Hello, Sal.  Morning.  Nick should have won that game last night, huh?  Here comes the prima donna.  I mean, here comes Sal.  You see Pierce's shot at the end? 
[01:16:00]  I actually only saw the highlights.  I didn't get to actually watch the game.  Oh, you're not a fan then.  I know.  All right.  So what's happening here?  What happened?  I don't know.  Just be honest.  I don't care.  No, I mean, everything that was said so far is completely honest.  So there's nothing to straighten out.  I mean, if Eric wanted to say that I was the one who went to Gary, whatever.  Eric's done enough for me to help me over the time I've been here.  So it's fine.  How much time were you spending?  Wait, did you go to Gary?  I didn't.  No.  I already said I went to Gary because the situation wasn't being taken care of. 
[01:16:30]  How much time were you spending going and getting food?  And there's nothing that I can do.  Honestly, there are days where I probably did like seven runs, and then I would still  have the work that was given to me prior to then to complete it.  And then it's like, well, why wasn't this done?  It's like, well, let's see.  I haven't sat down since I got here at 530.  It's 9 o'clock.  You know what I mean?  Well, Kenny, would you like to retort?  Well, I'm still confused by the timeline if Travis says he went to Gary.  I was wondering when that was. 
[01:17:00]  I don't have a specific date.  I'm sorry.  All right.  But do you recall the morning when you came to get my credit card for Jimmy's second cup  of coffee?  Yes, I do.  And I said, Eric gave me a talking to and Sal can't go?  Yes, I do.  Okay.  And then you sent Sal anyway.  Yes, I did.  Not an hour later, I got my talking to by Gary, and then I brought that to your attention?  Yes.  And then you did the right thing and stood up, and you told me that you were going to take 
[01:17:30]  the blame.  Well, there was no blame to take.  I sent Sal, and I told Gary that.  All right.  So is that the time you're talking about that you went to Gary?  No.  Or was it a time before that?  I believe I told him the day before.  Okay.  And as a result of that, what happened?  As a result of my talking to Gary?  Yeah.  I think Gary had a talking with you.  Right?  Well, Eric had a talk to me first. 
[01:18:00]  Okay.  Well, then that's what happened.  But no, look, I told you that you erroneously got blamed for, or it was insinuated that you  sent Sal after you were told not to.  Correct.  And you can ask Gary.  I told Gary, I sent Sal because we had nobody else.  Then why did Gary go and talk to Kenny?  That was before.  Before what?  Wait, it sounds like this thing could have been solved internally, but Kenny kept sending 
[01:18:30]  Sal after what Erock said.  That's incorrect.  Oh, shit.  Erock, is that true or false?  I spoke with Kenny.  Yeah, because Sal did come complain a second time after that.  Because after I spoke with Kenny, and then Sal had said that he was still being sent on  food run.  And Kenny, you didn't want to take a chance with the new guys?  No, no.  That's incorrect.  Once Eric told me that somebody cried about being mistreated. 
[01:19:00]  Sal.  He's in the room.  I was bawling in the office, dude.  I was just, I couldn't take it.  Oh, obviously.  Oh, boy.  So, Sal was crying like a little bitch, according to Kenny, but Sal is saying differently?  Yeah, maybe not literally, but figuratively.  Figuratively, okay.  Were you crying like a bitch, Sal?  I was, it was terrible.  You just didn't want to do seven, what, food runs a day?  Look, at the end of the day, yes, I'm honored, and I'm flattered that I was able to be accepted 
[01:19:30]  by Kenny, and took on this privilege of being able to get you guys' stuff, and rightfully  so, like, if you guys...  Sounds sarcastic.  No, no, no.  I'm not being sarcastic.  No, I'm being serious.  If you guys want something, there's absolutely no fucking reason in this world why any of  you guys shouldn't get it, and get it correct, and get it as fucking humanly as fast as  possible.  Well, there obviously is, because you complained about it.  Oh.  Well, because...  Oh, all right.  But, so, by the way, anybody in management, I'm telling you right now, we are instigating 
[01:20:00]  this discussion on air, so I don't want to hear anybody in fucking management come and  tell me, well, that kind of thing, this is on air, and it's instigated by us to be discussed  on air, because that shit that festers behind the scenes, it winds up blowing up eventually  in one way or the other, so we are bringing this to the air, so nobody in management go  and complain, because Kenny and Sal are fucking doing this on the air.  This was me.  I instigated this.  Yeah, because I was also once told, I'm not allowed to stir shit up on the radio. 
[01:20:30]  If there's a problem, I have to tell the bosses.  Well, that's why I don't have any respect for Gary.  It wasn't Gary that told him that.  Well, I've heard it over the years.  Gary doesn't want to be fodder for this radio show, and I told him the other day that he  needs to quit if he doesn't want to be fodder for the radio show.  I guess I should bring that up today.  Wow.  I said, because over the...  Who said wow?  I did.  Jesus, Sam.  What's wrong with you, you corporate fucking douche?  Start wearing a tie.  You really should.  What's wrong with you?  And then tie the other end to a beam.  Why is that a wow?  It's not a bad wow. 
[01:21:00]  It's just like, wow.  I've been doing radio since 18.  I don't need guys like Gary in my life.  I know, but...  And I told him, I go, look, everyone that has ever worked for the Opie and Anthony show,  peripheral, in studio, what have you, has been fodder for our show.  That's why we've been successful.  One of the reasons.  And he's trying to be part of this whole thing and not be fodder.  And I told him it's impossible and that he should quit.  I agree with you 100% and I appreciate...  I agree with you, but generally in Gary's life, I'm assuming not a lot of people have 
[01:21:30]  been so blatant about their disapproval of his job, which is why I think it's funny.  He's the wrong guy.  I told him to his face.  Yeah.  And I told him, tough shit.  I go, tough shit.  You got...  Here's your decision.  You can continue working for the channel.  I don't want you to, but at least allow us to use you.  At least allow us to discuss you openly on the show. 
[01:22:00]  But it's not about me.  No.  It's about the whole food thing.  And look, I don't consider...  I heard Sam's little stupid wow in the background.  Believe me, I don't consider getting our food to be an honor.  It's not...  We're not that arrogant.  I'm speaking to what anybody says.  Horrible, thankless job.  I just don't like my food getting fucked up, and it's been fucked up enough times over  the years.  When you find someone that does it right, you just want that person to do it, because I  want to eat.  Believe me, I don't look at it like it's the equivalent of fucking bringing JFK his coffee  in the morning.  I understand that. 
[01:22:30]  But Kenny, it is an honor, right?  In the end.  It sure is, GH.  Oh God.  So where are we at?  Sal just didn't want to go six, seven times a morning.  Well, it's just...  Which I understand a little bit.  I was also doing additional work.  It's not like I was just getting...  Whose work?  I mean...  The show's work.  Yeah.  There's certainly a lot of production.  I mean, I've had close to 50-something productions get on air, and that doesn't happen that easily.  I don't have that much time to work on this stuff, so... 
[01:23:00]  And I think Travis went to Gary, because he felt like he had no choice.  I can't do anything.  No, I know.  You felt like he had no choice, because you thought E-Rock was taking care of the situation.  Yeah.  By saying, look, Sal doesn't want to do it as much, so Kenny, you've got to give these  new guys a chance.  My question is...  I'm just throwing the facts out there.  If Kenny...  I'm just asking.  If Kenny...  Why did Gary talk to Kenny after he had given...  And said to you, like, hey, look, Sal can't go. 
[01:23:30]  Give it to somebody else, and you gave it to Sal.  Why did Gary still come to Kenny?  That's a good point to clarify, Jim.  If Eric...  Who taskeded Eric to speak to me if Gary was going to speak to me also?  Oh, shit.  Eric?  Eric?  E-Rock?  Comment?  Comment?  Question?  What?  No.  I have to talk to Kenny, because I'm in charge of the interns.  So when they have problems, and it's starting to get to the point where, like, this is really  going to escalate if we don't do something about it, I have to talk to Kenny.  And you felt like Kenny didn't hear you, because he continued to use Sal? 
[01:24:00]  That's not true.  I'm asking E-Rock, though, from where he sits, and then you could certainly say it's not true.  I know one time I talked with Kenny, he wasn't happy about it, but he made his point, which  is what you guys have been saying.  When you find somebody good who handles your stuff and doesn't screw it up, that's the  guy we use.  Understood.  But Sal had been doing more and more production and turnaround stuff that was getting on the  air, and we had two other guys who aren't idiots, perfectly capable of doing the same 
[01:24:30]  thing.  I said, Kenny, we've got to start using these other guys.  Kenny did not want to use these other guys.  Oh, boy, Kenny.  That's what he's saying.  But I spoke with him, and I thought everything was fine.  And then all of a sudden, you know, I hear from Sal again.  Sal's getting pissed off, because he's still going on food runs.  And the other guys aren't being used.  And can I just say one thing?  I said I would still go for food runs.  It's not like I won't do them at all, and I'm too much of a fucking dickhead prima donna  to not go.  Just reduce it a little bit. 
[01:25:00]  Like, I can't go out seven times and still get anything else done.  It was assumed you went to Gary, but you did not.  No, I didn't.  And look, I honestly don't give a shit that Eric said that I went to Gary, because like  I said, Eric's helped me out so much over this time.  Well, why would Eric lie?  He's not me, so I can't speak to him.  So is Eric a liar?  I'm not calling Eric a liar.  I'm just saying that it's fine.  I said it's fine, because I'm just an intern.  I'm a pissing whipping boy that...  Eric, are you a liar?  I'm not lying.  I don't think Sal went to Gary. 
[01:25:30]  I think he probably went to either Iraq or Travis, and Travis was saying he went to Gary.  I already said it.  Then Eric, if that wasn't true, why would you tell me that Sal was the one that told Gary?  Right now, because I said, when you were asking earlier, I said, Travis, no, Sal, no.  I said, is it me?  And you said, no.  And he said, he's standing next to you.  I said, Sal.  I said Sal's name already.  No, we're not talking about today.  Yeah.  All right?  Okay.  A morning, I confronted you. 
[01:26:00]  Okay.  Why did you tell me it was Sal, if that was, in fact, not true?  At that time, I probably thought it was Sal, because that morning, I was told that I had  to speak to you, and that all the intern food orders and everything had to be asked to...  You had to ask me to do all that.  You just said you were told you had to speak to me.  Told by whom?  By Gary.  And Gary didn't tell you who went to him?  Not at that point.  My thing is, Kenny can't tell an intern we need something that has to go through E-Rod.  Which, that is ridiculous.  Of course it's ridiculous. 
[01:26:30]  Not within my span of control.  Of course it's ridiculous.  And the fact that I had to have that conversation with Kenny was ridiculous.  But the fact is that if I text Kenny something, he's got to go to you.  It's just so stupid and fucking corporate and idiotic.  Well, that's dumb Gary.  Exactly.  Sam, shut up.  It's funny.  Let me be me.  It's funny.  It is dumb Gary, though.  It's another layer of bullshit that we don't need.  All right.  Well, can I just say one thing?  Gary should have said, all right, well, let's fucking figure this out.  I'd like to make up with Kenny.  I'd like to just, because this is probably boring to everybody. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, no, you're saying, oh, you're boring on top of everything.  No, I'm not.  Maybe if he wasn't grabbing food, he would understand radio a little more.  This is what they call the gold.  You'd be surprised how many people love.  I guess I don't find myself interesting on air.  I'd much rather be doing stuff behind the scenes.  Anyway, I'd like to make up with Kenny.  I'd like to be, everything would be cool again with me, Kenny.  Naked man hugs?  Just a handshake.  It's great.  It's going to be just like it was at the beginning. 
[01:27:30]  I'll talk to Kenny.  I know how to talk to Kenny.  No, I really would, because I was also told I'm not allowed to speak to Kenny, and that's  just...  Oh!  Who told you you're not allowed to speak to Kenny?  Yeah, who said that?  Eric said I'm not allowed to speak to Kenny.  Eric.  I was requested...  That makes great working environments.  Why isn't Sal allowed to talk to Kenny?  No, because that's been for a few weeks, by the way.  Why?  Why is he not allowed to talk to Kenny?  Because I was requested to inform Sal that he's not to speak to him or make eye contact  or be in his general direction.  Who said that?  Me!  Kenny offered that request. 
[01:28:00]  So, like I said, I'd like to be able to look at Kenny.  I'd like to be able to shake his hand, say good morning to him.  Kenny, why don't you want Sal to look at you?  Because he doesn't like me.  Why don't you like Sal?  I don't like tattletale rats.  So, this was after the tattletaling?  Yes.  But he didn't really tattletale in the end.  Well, Eric said he did, so what am I supposed to believe?  It seems like he brought up a concern to his superior, which, believe it or not, which  is the most amazing part of this, E-Rock is his boss.  So, he wasn't the guy that went to Gary. 
[01:28:30]  He was going to suck it up.  Well, I was under the false belief, because I was told by Eric, that Sal was the one.  I knew it was Sal all along.  It wasn't Bratzini.  Bratzini.  It's Bratzini.  Bratzini.  So, you don't have any issue with Sal talking to E-Rock, because that's his superior.  So, if he has an issue, he can't, you know.  Yeah, that's got nothing to do with me. 
[01:29:00]  Okay.  So, where are we at?  We've got to, like, move on to something.  Yeah.  I'd like to make up with Kenny and...  Is he allowed to look at you, Ken?  It's up to you.  Now that you've got all the facts, is Sal allowed to actually look at you in the hallway?  Ask Eric.  Eric?  I would say yes, but it's really up to Kenny at this point.  Well, this whole thing, if he's not allowed to talk to an intern, because it could be an  HR, like, what the fuck is that?  No, I think it was Kenny's request. 
[01:29:30]  No, no, no, no.  Kenny just didn't want to.  No, Kenny's not allowed to ask the interns to get us.  Correct.  Because when I had my talking to, the talking to was to nip this in the bud before it became  an HR issue.  So, is this correct?  Whenever you get these fucking guys involved down the hall, it's just a fucking problem.  We wash our own dirty laundry, Eric.  Dirty?  Dirty.  Yes.  Dirty.  Dirty.  Oh. 
[01:30:00]  Dirty laundry.  Dirty laundry.  Was that a mispronounce, or is that an old cop thing?  No, it's not mispronounced.  I can't speak.  All wrong.  Dirty.  Dirty laundry.  Dirty.  Dirty.  All right.  And Travis felt like, you know, it wasn't being done internally, so he went to Gary.  The only reason, let me be incredibly specific here, that I went to my superior was because  Eric told me that he had talked to Kenny and that Kenny was still sending Sal.  So, to me, Eric was not getting the job done.  Eric, Eric's... 
[01:30:30]  Oh.  Well?  Well, let me ask you this, Travis.  As the boss of the show, the executive producer, you didn't consider coming to me before you  went to Gary?  Kenny, I have no control over the interns and I have been specifically told to stay out  of all intern affairs.  But did you talk to Kenny first?  No, I didn't.  And tell him, look, I'm going to have to go to Gary with this?  No.  That was the question.  Why didn't you consider that?  You just said you have no control over intern affairs, but yet you still went to Gary over 
[01:31:00]  an intern affair.  I went to Gary to tell him about the situation that Eric had brought to me.  Right.  Which you could just easily come to me first.  Well, Travis is a bit sensitive when it comes to interns.  You should...  You should have...  If you're going to go to Gary, you should tell Kenny...  Interns are the ones that are sensitive.  First, you know, told him not, though.  I don't know.  There's just something that bugs me about that.  Well, okay.  How about this?  If Eric is in charge of the interns and Eric asks for Sal's workload to be lowered, then 
[01:31:30]  that's Eric's, you know, that's Eric's decision.  And it should be respected.  Okay.  And if it's not respected, then you don't talk to Kenny.  You just go to Gary.  Perhaps I made an error in judgment.  Maybe I should have gone to Kenny.  I am...  Choose your words. 
[01:32:00]  I'm very hesitant about anything that has to do with interns after my situation.  I understand that.  Situation.  Wow.  So maybe if this were to happen again, I would think differently, but...  You didn't want an intern problem to get out of hand, obviously.  I did.  Because of what might have happened in the past.  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Well, where are we now?  Which still haunts me.  It's still a bit raw.  Yes.  You cannot call me the executive producer.  Ouch.  We good now?  I don't have a problem with anyone.  I don't know about that.  Jimmy, where are you at now?  And Jim, I don't think you should either, because you've...  I mean, the last three weeks, everything's been fine, right?  My only issue is just all this Weasley behind the shits.  I just hate it. 
[01:33:00]  I just hate it.  See, we're untouchable, though.  These guys get a lot of fucking heat every day.  We're not untouchable, even.  You know what I mean?  Like, I know I can get in trouble.  I don't think I am.  I know I can get shit.  Because even if they say, you know what?  Fuck you.  You're out.  I'm still untouchable.  But these guys have to fucking, you know, still try to get their careers together.  I understand that.  They get a lot of fucking heat behind the scenes.  And that's my problem, is why...  And that's why it leads to what you're hearing today.  Because these guys get beat up all the fucking time. 
[01:33:30]  Well, it's fucking...  Why would anybody bring him into it?  There's no reason.  I'm not knocking...  I'm really not shit...  If I was shit on Gary, I'd shit on him, and I'd have no problem with that.  But it's not even about me judging that guy.  It's simply why even...  There's no reason to go down the hall.  I understand from a fundamental view, but I know what happens to these guys when we're  not here.  It's a fucking nightmare.  They get in trouble for stuff we bring up on the air.  Because they can't talk to us like that.  And that's another...  Because they can't talk to us like that. 
[01:34:00]  They know we're not going to deal with that shit.  No.  Mm-mm.  And incidentally, that's another thing with down the hall.  I don't like guys being told what they can talk about on air and what they can't be  talking about on air.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  But that's the shit that goes on all the fucking time.  I think we're a good judge.  They have sat down probably the entire staff at this point, probably, and basically told  them, do not stir the shit on air. 
[01:34:30]  And this is a fucking 20-hour-a-week radio show.  Which shows me, obviously, going back to my Gary point, that he doesn't get it, and he  should fucking move on.  I heard the company gave him another promotion anyway, so fucking do the music thing.  And we'll be good without you, to be honest with you.  Oh, boy.  Because if you don't understand that we've got to stir the shit, because it makes good  radio, I have no use for you in my life.  And nobody down the hall likes the on-airs.  It's not even just Gary.  It's other guys, too. 
[01:35:00]  I know.  Just don't like it.  I know.  And it's like, you guys got to understand, you have no say in what we complain about  on the air.  But you see what they do?  They sit these guys down in offices, and they're in a different place in their lives  and their careers, and they put pressure on them and go, look, we don't want you stirring  this shit up.  Well, we don't work for the Opie and Anthony show.  No, I know.  So that's where a lot of this comes from.  They get fucking beat up.  I actually agree with Jimmy, but I'm just trying to explain where it comes from.  No, no.  I understand that.  You know, I've heard from these guys, all of them, personally, that, look, these guys 
[01:35:30]  beat the crap out of us and tell us not to stir the shit.  Why wouldn't you want to stir the shit?  It makes way better radio than talking about some who gives a fuck story in the news.  Yeah, this stuff happens, and it's like the only way to, I like to bring it up on the  air.  I prefer it to be fucking hashed out, and this way it doesn't build up into other situations  that just wind up getting out of control.  And there's so much fucking resentment and hatred built up behind the scenes. 
[01:36:00]  It just, you know, it's irreparable.  So I think Gary needs to step down would be a very good start, a very good start, and  get someone that, you know, doesn't mind being made fun of on the air and understands what  the show is all about.  Right.  I say we start there.  Rob will allow to continue to be an intern.  He's not an intern.  Because he's learning.  Someday he's going to be good.  He's just disrespectful. 
[01:36:30]  Any final thoughts here?  I hope Sal can look at Kenny.  That's my biggest concern.  Somebody Twittered me, diva cunts, get your own breakfast.  Sir, it's not an option.  No, it's not.  Like, you guys are doing your fucking job, and you should get anything you want at that  moment.  So, I completely understand.  That makes it tough to just leave and get breakfast.  I got breakfast.  I got cereal right there.  Someone wrote, it all went downhill after English Bob left. 
[01:37:00]  English Bob.  British Bob.  British Bob.  All right.  Kenny, final thoughts?  Eric?  I'm happy to be here.  I love you guys.  Not so much Travis, E-Rock, and Sal, though, huh, at this point?  No, like, we can all get along.  No, it's not.  Whose app is that? 
[01:37:30]  I don't know.  This thing stinks.  We'll explain that next.  What fucking stupid shit thing is this?  Can we explain that next?  Because that's going to be another 20 minutes, please.  That's still a useless fucking hunk of shit.  I see you set it up on your iPhone.  We'll explain that.  I was trying.  That'll be a good tease.  Hopefully for the people that didn't tune us out.  Fucking Einstein.  Eric?  Incompetent?  Or?  Yes.  Eric is incompetent.  Eric, you all right?  How you were represented here today?  I'm fine with that, and I think we should send Rob for food. 
[01:38:00]  For us?  It's not a bad idea.  What else does he do?  What does he do between 6 and 10 that he can't get his food, Sam?  Seriously.  Rob's the intern.  Well, between 6 and 10 or by the time he gets here until 10?  Exactly.  He listens to the show.  He's monitoring, making sure everything's okay, checking the stop sets.  What do you mean he's monitoring?  What is it he?  We got this.  Relax.  Go get us some fucking food.  He's got to make sure the spots are in the right spot. 
[01:38:30]  I don't know what these guys do.  Someone explain it to me someday.  He's got to make sure the advertisements are in the right.  And Rob, I swear to you, I'm not trashing you.  You're going to be a really good manager someday.  You are.  Why?  That's not a compliment.  I guess it's a compliment.  Are you still green?  Comparatively.  But he's been in the business for, I mean, for years.  Oh, this is terrible.  This is the worst app thing ever.  What does that thing do?  Well, it's supposed to take some kind of 360 picture and it stinks. 
[01:39:00]  I'll explain after the break.  Yeah.  That crap.  So we're all good.  We're all good.  Travis, you're good.  Jimmy, you're good.  I'm fine.  Kenny.  Yes, sir.  Jimmy.  Thumbs up for Jimmy.  Okay.  All right.  Kirk Cameron and that thing that Ant just added to his iPhone.  Jesus.  Okay.  What is this?  All right.  What's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem? 
[01:39:30]  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good because I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this? 
[01:40:00]  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not going to die.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  On SiriusXM.

Troy, I get you're a DJ, but nobody likes Dubstep.  Stop putting it in your production.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Hey, this fuck you goes out to the guy who fucked my best friend's girlfriend after I told my best friend  that you had recovered from your heroin addiction and that you were a good guy and then you went and fucking relapsed and fucked his girlfriend of two years. 
[01:41:30]  Fuck you.  Fuck you, you fucking piece of shit.  Fuck you.  This fuck you goes out to whomever Jess lost a bet to and now she has to marry Sam.  Don't you realize what you're doing to her?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I seriously almost blew chunks all over my windshield listening to fucking douchebag Sam talk about his fucking cock and how disgusting it is.  That is fucked up.  I do not want to hear Sam on the radio anymore.  I cannot listen to this turd salad for the rest of the week. 
[01:42:00]  Fuck you, Sam.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give a fuck you to myself.  I'm a virgin and this girl was going to give me a blowjob and my penis stayed limp.  She tried playing with me, stroking me.  I couldn't get my penis off and it was humiliating.  So fuck you to myself.  Fuck you.  This F.U. goes out to the guy complaining about the girl rubbing up on him.  Obviously she's not returning your text because you can't be trusted with the secret she was trying to test you with.  You're a fucking bitch.

[01:43:00]  Roy S. in Boston writes,  done crying about breakfast?  Oh, God.  Yes, we're done crying about breakfast.  I think it was a bigger issue.  Roy S. in Boston.  What an idiot.  I thought about the breakfast, Roy.  So I see you got a little attachment.  Well, I can't call it little.  A big attachment for your iPhone, eh?  This thing is ridiculous.  It's like the CDC building on top of your phone. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Sam, what is this about?  Well, I saw you came in with packages.  Sam knows a little extra info on this whole thing.  And I don't have an iPhone, so I don't know why this guy thought I could use this.  I was at the Ring of Honor show last night.  And...  I can't even look at you.  Why?  It was a great show.  What is the Ring of Honor show?  Ring of Honor is a wrestling promotion.  What a surprise.  Very high-level, independent wrestling promotion.  Oh, yeah.  It's a 10th anniversary show.  It's quite an accomplishment. 
[01:44:00]  Who wrestled?  Kevin Steen taking on Jimmy Jacobs.  Adam Cole got a pinfall victory over Davey Richards.  Did he?  Yeah.  It's huge, right?  Briscoes beat the Young Bucks.  So, isn't this great?  Fantastic show.  The stars of tomorrow today.  You got a really boring life.  Listen, it wasn't boring at all.  Uh, but, the most exciting part was getting to see the Harry T. 
[01:44:30]  Who's Harry T?  Harry T started with this show.  Did I ever meet friends that shaved T?  Oh, shaming Harry.  Ah, see, Harry, Harry.  Harry T was an intern at the same time as me.  We had the same intern class.  What?  He worked for this show?  He was an intern for this show.  You may remember him as the intern who requested his own bit.  Yes.  Or the intern who went on to be the producer for Ron and Fez, which made me very jealous 
[01:45:00]  because I was a better intern than him.  Wait, you wanted to be the producer for Ron and Fez?  Well, I just wanted a gig at that point.  You wanted anything.  Right.  I'm happy with the way things turned out.  I really don't remember Harry at all.  Well, Anthony once called him a lying sack of cunt.  Yes.  I remember Anthony saying that one day.  I called him a lying sack of cunt.  It was about Harry T. He had an infamous bit on the Ron and Fez show where he stole  his comedy routine about sweatpants from Seinfeld.  And that went on and on.  Yeah.  Is that Harry T we're looking at right now? 
[01:45:30]  That's him.  I have no recollection.  Never seen him before in your life.  No, I swear.  No, I remember him.  He was a very swarthy Armenian type.  Yeah, he was right.  Wow.  All right.  I guess he worked for us for a while.  Yeah.  Oh, boy, he was.  But now he's a comedian and he does a lot of improv and stuff like that.  But he also is some kind of representative for this company that makes this 360 attachment  for your iPhone.  So you could take video in 360 degrees.  And he was at the Ring of Honor show last night taking video of it in 360. 
[01:46:00]  And then he ran into me and gave me a bag of them to give to Opie, Anthony and Jim.  Let me ask you, can you go on YouTube and see what it's supposed to look like?  Because that's a good idea.  According to Anthony's, it looks like you gave your iPhone cataracts.  Yeah, yeah.  Same thing.  I mean, you can drag it around.  No, the concept is kind of cool.  You get a 360 degree view of what you're looking at.  Wait, is it 360? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, see, because you could watch the video and then you could also, like, move it in  the frame of the video to get any part of the room.  Are you getting 180 or 360?  Because it doesn't look good, right?  Watch, watch.  Well, this doesn't look like 360.  Yeah.  And then it starts right there.  It looks like 180.  That's just a small room.  It's either a really small room or his is only 180.  No, I'm seeing one wall there behind them.  That's one.  That's two walls right there.  That's two.  I got you.  Three and four, okay. 
[01:47:00]  Three.  Oh, he's just in a tiny little room.  He's in a tiny little room doing 360 panoramic fucking video.  How about you show how cool it is by going to Times Square or something?  A big open space.  Well, how about you get a better fucking-  Not in a tiny one-bedroom apartment in New York City.  A clearer, uh, I understand the concept, but get a clearer-  Well, here's what I am wondering is, Anthony, now that you've installed it, you've installed  the app, has Harry T redeemed himself from the days of-  of being a lying sack of cunt. 
[01:47:30]  This thing sucks dick as far as an iPhone attachment.  That's not what he was looking for today.  Well, look, I'm sorry.  He was looking for a little plugola.  Uh, all I'm seeing is blurry-ass video.  Uh, again, I like the 360 feature.  You gotta- you gotta download an app for it.  Mm-hmm.  Doesn't work on its own.  Which you didn't like, because you were taking video of just the camera.  Yeah, yeah.  It just looked like the inside of a camera lens, which is exactly what I was taking.  But the picture on the box, it looks crystal clear.  Sure does.  Like you're seeing the universe. 
[01:48:00]  Sure does.  Yeah, with, uh, with, uh, my camera, with my iPhone, I just used it, and I'm getting  360 degrees of fucking blur.  Of a blur.  Like you're looking through a shower door.  It's- yeah.  Yeah.  Or a frosted bathroom window.  It's not working very well, is all I'm saying.  That's too bad.  I'm gonna give it a shot, because I think Ant's phone is just dirty.  Fail.  Well, it's called the Cogito dot.  Cogito?  Yeah.  That's a dumb name.  No real instructions given to you. 
[01:48:30]  Wait, is there- how do you get the film off of it?  Exactly.  I'm frightened.  The first time I took- there was film still on the outside of the thing here.  It's intuitive.  You don't need a-  Okay, here we go.  I'm gonna- I'm gonna- I'm gonna try to take some 360 video.  Here we go.  Watch.  All right, you're- but you have to hold the phone up in the air like this?  Some other- no, it's supposed to be on a flat surface in a room.  You can't point it like you-  But if I put it here, you don't have to point it, because it's taking video of the entire  room right now.  Can you point it?  Why would I? 
[01:49:00]  There's no reason to point it.  I don't have to point it.  But you can't look in the viewfinder or whatever it's called?  You can't look at the screen?  Why do I have to?  And it would have to hang upside down and look into his phone now.  Why would I have to?  So you can see what you're filming?  I'm filming everything.  It's 360.  Exactly, Sam, you're queer.  Yeah, this gadget has problems.  And then I shut it off, and now I look at what I got.  Okay.  I see-  Did you get me and Opie?  Sounds like a real comedy of errors.  This is great.  Look, look.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that me?  Do I need my glasses?  No, no. 
[01:49:30]  Or is it blurrier than anything I've ever seen?  How's it going?  Where's it go?  Are we in it?  Or Opie Anthony and-  Everyone in it?  I couldn't tell.  It's too blurry.  It's the fog monster.  So why is the quality of the camera so low?  There's got to be reason for that.  Because the iPhone is focusing.  The auto zoom is trying to work, yet it can't, because it's got a big fucking police siren  on top of it.  What is the app, Ant? 
[01:50:00]  I'm going to get the app.  The Looker app.  Just put in Looker.  Ooh.  And get that.  I'm afraid my picture will come up.  Let's go to Lady Trucker.  Lady Trucker.  Hey, Opie.  I was wondering if I could have your 360, please.  I've seen you.  You don't need 360 more pounds.  Believe me.  I could give you my 170, by the way, not 360, you fat slob.  I'm going to make you 720.  We all had a fucking math joke, huh?  Yeah.  360 would make her 1,360. 
[01:50:30]  1,000 pounder.  Big gal.  Big gal, are you?  These are all the videos.  What about, is there anything they say about focus?  Well, why don't we see one of the videos online?  Because if their video is really good, that means you're doing something wrong.  Go with an outdoor.  Something outdoorsy.  Yeah, an outdoorsy thing.  Or go inside.  The focus stinks.  You can see the top of the camera in this one. 
[01:51:00]  Is this in it?  The co-getter looker.  Oh, that's it.  Ooh, it's free.  I love a free app.  You see why you should look at the viewfinder?  Yeah, the guy doesn't even know what he's filming.  You got to look at the screen.  Look, the concept is good, but they're going to have to work out some bugs, obviously.  Bugs?  This has bugs like Mr. Pratt did in fucking Creepshow.  It's a very good reference.  Very good reference.  It actually is.  But it was just funny because you cocked up on the bat and went, 
[01:51:30]  Bugs!  Bugs, let me tell you.  I'll tell you a certain thing about bugs, ladies and gentlemen.  They creep up on you.  All right, are we done with this stupid thing?  I don't think you...  We got all the radio to do.  Please, let's move on.  I don't think you can upload to YouTube.  And try the whole thing.  You set up apps and all sorts of shit.  Says who, you fucking dumb.  My review.  That's my official review.  Wait, why am I filming...  What am I doing?  Exactly! 
[01:52:00]  No, but I'm...  Oh, you gotta calibrate it.  What?  Yeah!  Oh my god.  What's that mean, calibrate?  How do you do that?  Hit the lock.  I'm breaking everything.  No, it's ridiculous.  Hit what lock?  I don't know.  Anthony, how do I...  It's on the other page.  Let me see.  Go back.  Seems so difficult.  I just want to make movies.  Oh.  Did you open the camera or the app?  The camera.  App!  Oh, the app is the problem.  Okay, hold on.  Open the app.  The Looker app.  Ooh.  Looker would like to use your current location. 
[01:52:30]  No!  No, not mind your fucking business.  I gotta calibrate my dot.  You wanna calibrate now?  Yeah, see the lock?  Yes, begin calibrating.  See the lock icon?  All right, now move that green thing around  until it's right over the picture thingy.  That?  Yeah.  Okay.  Now lock it again.  All right, you're calibrated.  Now take video.  Ant, I'm getting a communique from the guy 
[01:53:00]  that actually engineers my website.  Yeah?  The Galaxy Nexus, like yours and mine,  I didn't upgrade yet to my Galaxy Nexus,  does it automatically.  How?  So the iPhone doesn't have this yet.  You just select camera,  then in the option select the pano  and move it around the room for free.  No plug-ins.  I think I know what to do wrong.  Well, you could do pano.  That's different.  I could do pano, too.  This is different than pano.  Why is it different than pano?  Because this, you're moving the video around 
[01:53:30]  in a 360-degree circle around you.  To see different things happening in the room.  So it's as if you were surrounded  by video cameras that are moving  behind you, in front of you,  and as you play it,  you have access to all of those cameras.  And you decide what angle you want.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Is there a place in the camera  where it won't autofocus?  I know.  That's what I would assume.  This seems so complicated.  I would assume.  Where's the camera  in your general settings? 
[01:54:00]  If you can find a way  to not autofocus the camera...  Right.  Then, well,  then how do we know  it's focused in the first place?  Well, it couldn't be worse  than it is now.  It's terrible.  Well, look.  It's obvious that it has bugs.  We can move on.  Bugs?  Please.  Yeah.  We're seeing all the videos, though.  They all kind of look as blurry  as what Ant showed us.  Terrible.  It's driving me batty.  Excuse my language.  It really is.  I get crazy  with electronic shit like this  that doesn't work.  Well, you gave it a good try, though, Ant.  Is there anything  we're doing wrong with? 
[01:54:30]  No.  Look at the rest of the videos.  They're all kind of the same quality.  That's not bad.  That isn't bad,  but I can't get that.  Not much better than yours.  And they got a lot of light  because they're outside.  I can't.  You need more light.  That's probably why.  It probably helps out a little bit.  Hey, we got more radio hosts  in trouble.  Oh, yeah?  Remember the guys in L.A.?  Yeah, they were very stupid.  And they liked your Bugs reference.  Fine.  Two radio hosts in L.A.,  KFI AM 640. 
[01:55:00]  It's a clear channel station.  So they do pretty conservative stuff.  Not politically.  I'm just saying very...  They're not shock jockery?  No.  They're not that crazy.  Shock jockery.  The radio hosts agree  to  sensitivity training  after calling Whitney Houston  a crack hoe.  And then they apologized.  And that still wasn't good enough.  For who?  For whoever.  Then don't apologize ever.  Never apologize. 
[01:55:30]  They are the people who said...  Oh, you said the Whitney Houston  crack hoe.  They agree to sensitivity training  and to completely defend these guys,  they had no choice.  They were told,  you're going to be taking  sensitivity training.  We're going to put that out  to the media  to hopefully calm some people down.  But, Reid,  what else they had to do, though?  A pair of popular L.A. radio hosts  have agreed to  cultural sensitivity training.  They want to reprogram their brains.  After one of them referred  to Whitney Houston  as a crack hoe  shortly after the singer  died last month. 
[01:56:00]  You can't reprogram people.  No.  It's never going to work.  Clear Channel Station  KFI AM 640  suspended John and Ken  who hosts  The John and Ken Show.  The John and Ken Show  or Jan and Ken.  For a few days last month  after John mimicked  what he thought  it must have been like  for friends of Houston  prior to her death.  So the one guy said it  and the other guy  has to do the sensitivity training, too.  Because his name's on the show.  Well, they want...  It's cultural sensitivity.  So basically,  they want you to go 
[01:56:30]  and learn  how to not  say things  that it's only okay  to say if you're black.  Right.  Like, don't use terminology  that you've heard  black people using  because you're white.  It's incorrect.  Right.  Clear Channel  stinks.  Horrible.  What?  That's no sense.  We live in a crazy world.  It's disgusting.  Why can't you reference Whitney  as being a crack hoe?  Which is, by the way,  different than crack whore.  But she was a crack hoe.  Sorry.  Yeah. 
[01:57:00]  She was fucking doing drugs.  What?  She wasn't fucking for money?  She threw her whole career away  getting fucking high.  Well, that's why some say  hoe instead of whore,  by the way.  That protects you a little bit.  When you do say the whore,  there's no doubt  in the person's mind  that he's saying,  look, you're doing something  for money  or the drugs.  It's like,  ah, Jesus,  here comes the crack hoe again.  What's she going to do?  Oh, look at that.  She's doing handstands  next to the pool.  Very good.  Crack hoe.  Nice.  After a while,  everybody's exhausted 
[01:57:30]  and then you find out  she's dead.  That's what they said.  Yep.  And it was a pretty open,  honest discussion about it,  by the way.  They weren't trying to be shocking  at all.  We play the tape on our show.  Yeah.  According to a memorandum  to the L.A. community  from KFI  dated Thursday,  executives and talent there  have had individual conversations  and community meetings  that have resulted  in six courses of action.  The most significant  being number four.  Community meetings.  Six courses of action  for this?  To discuss why, 
[01:58:00]  how gun violence  in the community  is not a big priority  or being taken care of,  but these two dumbbells  are important?  And why is Clear Channel  allowing this community  organization  to fucking get involved  with their business?  Terrible.  Terrible.  This is what you tell  these fucking dopes.  Look,  we took care of the problem  internally.  Mind your beeswax.  John and Ken  along with key staff  and management  will participate.  Why key staff  and management  if the guys  were just talking 
[01:58:30]  that day  and said it?  So why are the other guys  even responsible  for what they said?  Well, Ope,  you gotta be  culturally sensitive.  You gotta be  culturally sensitive.  Unbelievable.  Now the brass  that also has to go,  now they can convey  to other on-air people  sensitivity  to other cultures.  Well,  John and Ken  along with key staff  and management  will participate  in cultural sensitivity  training,  furthering their awareness  of the cultural melting pot  that is Southern California. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, my Lord.  Fraudulent language.  Ugh.  Ugh.  That made my stomach hurt.  Yes.  It's a lie.  Please go after us.  We'll call Whitney Houston  a crack hoe  every day of the week.  This shit,  all the signs.  She was out of her  fucking mind.  They found her  with a gravy boat  next to her.  Right.  What normal person  takes a bath  with a fucking gravy boat?  A gravy boat.  Holy fuck,  all the signs were there.  She was a lunatic.  John and Ken, though,  bill themselves  as being unafraid  to be politically incorrect 
[01:59:30]  and in fact  have mocked such ideas  as sensitivity training  when it has been applied  to others in the news.  You know,  we've been down this road  and we've been forced  to do shit  we never wanted to do.  to save the fucking show  and that's all this is about.  They don't believe  in the sensitivity training  whatsoever  and they won't believe in it  after they go through it  by the way.  Meaning this whole thing  is a crock of shit.  I'd like to go through it  once to see what it is.  Like, I know it was...  Words hurt.  We did it.  But I want to see  what that class is,  what that thought policing is.  We actually didn't do it. 
[02:00:00]  They handed out  the damn pamphlet  and we didn't take it seriously  and then we got in trouble  for that too.  KFI also said that  since their return  to the airways  after issuing two apologies,  they had to go  for two apologies.  John and Ken have hosted  a guest on air  to discuss  what?  So they apologized  what?  They apologized twice then  and then it's  John and Ken have hosted  a guest on air  to discuss why  the comments  were particularly offensive  to the African American community.  Shut the fuck up.  Can you imagine  sitting through that?  No.  Wow.  Congratulations, black people. 
[02:00:30]  I've said it before.  You've become suburban white women.  Yeah.  Little just whiny fucking shits.  Yeah.  The same as fucking white ladies  in the suburbs  who didn't like rap lyrics.  Yeah.  The same thing.  By the way,  I would just say to these idiots  who...  I don't give a fuck  you're offended.  I'm just...  I'm doing an entertaining radio show.  Tough shit.  You're not going to like everything  when...  You know, we do.  Why would you sit through that?  I'm sure...  They had no choice.  They had to say their kids.  I'm sure you've laughed  at things that are offensive 
[02:01:00]  to other people.  Right.  So, fuck it.  How do we get to a place  where now  you have to worry about  who you offend  on a daily basis  on a radio show?  Five-point program on...  Where did that start?  Six-point program  on how to make them  better people.  Yes, a six-point program  on how to make up  and learn  what is the melting pot  that is Southern California.  Southern California.  Mexicans.  God, what phony fucking...  It's not a melting pot.  It's a phony group.  It's a bean pot. 
[02:01:30]  Jesus.  Let's be real about it.  It's riddled with gangs  that don't like each other.  What are they talking about?  It's the phoniest...  They don't get along  with each other,  so why do you have to make believe  everyone should get along  on a radio show?  They should go to  sensitivity training.  God.  The station also said  it will expand  its internship program.  Oh, to do what?  To target minority students.  Oh, good.  Unbelievable.  No, no, no.  That's what would help.  They were insensitive  and they should target  minority students.  Now, that's only acceptable  if it's for a good thing. 
[02:02:00]  If you say,  I want to target minority students,  say, to watch them...  Oh!  Oh, whoa, whoa!  So you get the minority...  Doomed.  Doomed.  Pukey.  So now, you know,  they're being forced  to not get the best interns.  They're forced to get...  Minority interns.  A variety of interns  of different backgrounds.  Oh, believe me,  the variety...  By variety,  they mean no more  white people.  You get some black interns  because I'm sure  all the black stations  are being forced...  Oh, that's right.  So let's do that  and we'll update guidelines  for our on-air hosts 
[02:02:30]  in a way that is helpful  in a live,  unscripted environment.  Oh.  Oh, good.  Do you think  it'll be helpful?  I don't.  Oh, God.  Live, unscripted,  and they want to  somehow control it  so that they don't,  you know...  What do you think  they'll say?  Things like,  you know,  when you're going  through something,  you really have  to think it out more.  Don't just blurt things out.  You know,  spontaneity,  ooh, yuck.  But we played the clip.  Yeah.  They weren't even trying  to be outrageous  or hateful.  No.  They were just discussing  Whitney Houston,  which we all knew 
[02:03:00]  was a fucking mess.  How else do you describe her?  How else do you describe her?  Oh, I don't know.  She was doing crack.  She was a great singer,  talented person,  who fucked up  and threw away  her gift on drugs.  Just like Jim Morrison,  just like Jimi Hendrix,  just like Janis Joplin,  just like Amy Winehouse.  Amy Winehouse  was a fucking drunk  and a junkie.  What's the matter?  Because you threw  hoe in there.  Whitney Houston  was known 
[02:03:30]  or at least believed  to be doing crack.  Crack hoe  is a common term.  They would say that  about a white lady  who was doing crack.  It doesn't necessarily  have to do with  the sexual aspect of hoe.  No.  When you put crack  with it,  it's crack hoe.  It's just a term  for a woman  that does crack.  That's all.  And this,  by the way,  I hate to keep saying it,  but when people  think about regular radio,  it's not the profanity  that I can't.  It's this shit.  Yep.  Even though XM  did it to us once,  too,  they fucked us once 
[02:04:00]  in the homeless trolley  That was when  Shithead was at the helm.  Yeah.  Fuck that guy.  Nate.  Nate.  Shithead.  Hey, Nate,  you dick.  Oh, Shithead.  And that Owen guy,  is it Clive Owen?  What's his name, Sam?  Yeah.  No, what's his name again?  Clive Davis.  Oh, yeah, Clive Davis.  Clive Owen.  That Owen guy,  Clive Davis.  That Owen guy,  Clive Davis, what?  I've read a lot  on Whitney Houston.  So I consider myself  a bit of an expert on this.  I do.  Clive Davis  actually had to lend 
[02:04:30]  Whitney Houston  a bunch of money  to save her houses  or at least one house.  So wouldn't that mean  that she was using  her money for something else?  And wouldn't that kind of  be a definition of  hoeing yourself a little bit  that now you're looking  for money elsewhere?  You don't even have to get  into the semantics of hoe.  It's just a crack hoe  is a girl,  a woman,  that does crack.  The hoe part  is just part of the word.  It becomes one word.  Crack hoe.  It's not a hoe  that does crack. 
[02:05:00]  Just stop it.  It's crack hoe.  I'm disappointed.  You're a crack hoe.  I'm not surprised,  but I'm disappointed,  Clear Channel,  because you've got to tell  all these idiots,  look, we handled it.  Show that you're  a powerful company.  And go, look,  I understand your concerns.  We don't need your help.  But we handled it, period.  Did you handle it  with six points?  That would be  my press release.  You show that you're  a powerful fucking company.  Or for once,  just let people  be offended at something.  For once. 
[02:05:30]  Once.  Stick up for your  fucking talent,  you shit companies.  For once.  Well, I'm working with them  a little bit here.  I completely agree  with you, Jimmy,  but at the very least,  go, look,  enough already.  We heard you.  They apologized,  and we handled it.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  And they were just  speculating what her  friends were saying,  tired of her behavior.  Right.  They were sad,  and look,  and then she,  and then,  I forget what they  said at the end,  but they were speculating  that their friends  were sick and tired  of her shit.  God,  these fucking companies, 
[02:06:00]  man,  I really,  I wish all these  executives in these  companies would just  fucking blow their  own brains out.  Yeah,  every one of them  is a worthless  albatross.  A worm.  No creativity  whatsoever,  and they never go  to bat for talent,  even when they don't  fucking violate the FCC.  No.  They give an opinion  that offends a certain  segment of the population,  and they have to come out  and say they're sorry  for their opinion.  Fucking sickening.  And everybody has a reason.  People on Twitter  are still hitting me.  Oh, the conservatives,  you guys missed the point. 
[02:06:30]  No.  You're fucking language  policing babies,  just like the conservatives  were in the 50s and 60s.  You're the same thing.  I'm sorry,  I'm babbling.  No, you're  abso-fucking-lutely right.  Lonnie,  California,  what's up, brother?  I guess my biggest  problem was with Jimmy.  Girl or boy,  by the way?  I'm sorry?  It's a woman.  But what's your name,  then?  Lonnie.  Hi, Lonnie.  Can Lonnie go both ways?  Yeah,  Lonnie's a boy's name,  though.  It's a girl's name.  He's a guy with a girl's name. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, it is.  But this is Lonnie,  so it's a girl with a girl's name.  I've known some Lonnie's  over the years.  Yeah, there's been a lot.  Lonnie, I'm sorry.  I thought it was a guy,  so I got confused.  Go ahead.  Okay,  I'm from Southern California,  and Jimmy,  I guess my problem is...  The girls are warm.  You talk all this shit.  Black people do this,  black people do that,  and as soon as you get  a black person in the studio,  you don't say shit.  You don't use the words you use.  It would be different  if you were practicing  what you preach.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Niggas, savages, monkeys.  I think you're confusing. 
[02:07:30]  First of all,  I have never come on the air  and said that niggers  were savages and monkeys.  Never once.  You're lying,  or you're hearing something  that you think is me,  and it isn't.  Well, maybe she doesn't know  all the voices yet.  She might not know  who's saying what.  Yeah, I think you're mixing  a lot of things up,  and what you're saying now  is a blatant lie.  Okay, so,  just like,  you don't say nigger  just to prove the point  that you can say nigger.  No. 
[02:08:00]  It's always in context  of the conversation.  Always in context  of the conversation.  I've used it as an example.  Never in context.  When have I ever,  hold on,  when have I ever used it  inappropriately?  Whenever you say it,  it's inappropriate.  Why?  Oh, regardless of context.  Okay, regardless of context.  Because I'm just saying,  Jimmy,  if Don Cheadle  was in the,  when he was in the studio,  and if you had a real  conversation, you know,  you guys want to know  what's going on  with black youth,  ask a black guy  when he's in there,  and then say nigger  in context.  You would never say it. 
[02:08:30]  Maybe, you know what,  maybe if we got to know  Don Cheadle a little better,  and not just the first  interview that we have  with him for 10 minutes,  20 minutes,  when we're talking  about his movie,  after a while,  you know,  that conversation  would come out.  It's not an appropriate  first conversation.  That's Anthony.  Yeah, that's me.  Oh, I know it's Anthony.  Anthony's just a blatant racist,  so I respect him.  Oh, goody.  But then you have  black friends,  but then you talk  all this shit.  Do you,  do you understand  how many arguments  I've had with my black, 
[02:09:00]  do you know how  Patrice and I,  or Keith and I,  for years,  have had these discussions,  brutally honest,  but you just came on  and lied.  You just fucking lied,  and said that I say  that blacks are savages,  and I've never said that once.  Okay, can I give you  an example?  Yes.  When something happened  when there were like  50 people out  of somebody's house,  and the police came,  and you go,  that reminds me of a movie  where you're not talking  about Planet of the Apes.  I don't even remember,  I don't even remember.  No, obviously not,  no. 
[02:09:30]  I don't remember,  honestly,  I don't remember  the discussion,  but no.  Why would you infer that?  Because that's what happened  in Planet of the Apes.  There was 50 people  outside of a house  in Planet of the Apes?  Lovely Anthony  went on his usual website  and looked at a video  where 50 people  went to some girl's house  to beat her up.  I remember the case.  Lovely website I went to.  By the way,  I don't remember  the discussion,  but why couldn't it  have reminded me  of a fucking Spike Lee film?  Why couldn't it have  reminded me of  Do the Right Thing  where there was a fucking 
[02:10:00]  riot at the end of the movie?  Because that was not  what happened.  Oh, okay.  So you know  from me saying  that reminds me  of a movie.  So not only,  you come on and lie  and said that I said  that blacks were savages,  which I did not say,  and now you're telling me  what I meant  in a discussion  I had two weeks ago  when I,  come on.  Okay, well, Jimmy,  I apologize if you  weren't talking about  that movie,  but I'm pretty sure you were.  But listen to where  you go with it.  And by the way,  I've never used  the word nigger  angrily on the air.  I've never said 
[02:10:30]  that angrily.  I've used it  in a discussion  about how phony  Americans are  when they try to,  like say n-word  or when they try  to put words to bed  because then after nigger  it became retard  or you can't say chink  and now we're removing  all these words  from the language.  So that's the context  I've used it in.  And that's a perfectly,  I'm sorry?  Everybody can say  whatever the hell  they want to say.  I don't have a problem  with that.  I just have a problem  with people say something  and then act different  when they're in the presence  of something.  I would have this discussion,  let me tell you something,  if I'm not afraid 
[02:11:00]  to fucking yell  at Jesse Ventura,  I'm not afraid  to have a racial discussion  with a black guest.  Don Cheadle,  I was starstruck with,  we didn't talk about  any social issues.  And why have a racial discussion  with Don Cheadle?  Just because he's black  we're supposed to have  a racial discussion?  The guy's a great actor,  we were talking to him  about his acting  and his movies,  why should we ever  have to go to a race discussion  if we're just talking  about his movies?  The main thing  as a black woman  trying to listen  to this show  is hearing you guys  talk and just talk  about black people,  black people.  I know my cousins 
[02:11:30]  are acting up,  I get it,  we're fucking up,  I get it.  But it's like  when you have a black guy  in the studio  to say,  hey,  what do you think  is going on?  Because I don't need to  think it's acting like that.  I don't need to ask  because that's racist,  Lonnie.  I don't need to ask  D.L. Hughley  why other people  who are the same color  are doing something.  I can make my own observations  and he can make his.  But we've had those discussions  with D.L. Hughley  and certainly with Patrice O'Neill.  Patrice O'Neill,  have you never listened  to this show  when Patrice was on?  Lonnie,  are you that Twitter account  I was reading earlier? 
[02:12:00]  No.  Oh, okay.  Alright, never mind,  never mind, never mind.  So have you never listened?  No, sir,  I always listened  when Patrice was on.  Okay, well then  how could you say  we don't have these discussions  where we would just  for an hour and a half  we would go on  a fucking thing  about language  and removing words  and he actually agreed  with the ridiculousness  of removing words.  So how could you say that?  I was going to say  it's just like  why would you think  people wouldn't complain  about what these people  are saying?  I mean,  what world do you live in?  They're not on satellite radio.  Because Lonnie,  I'm listening to you  and I'm listening to 
[02:12:30]  what you've gotten wrong  so far.  You think that I won't  have those conversations  with a black guest  and you're just  completely wrong.  Because I've had them.  And I talk about it  on stage.  The opening of my act,  the first ten minutes  is about black and white.  Well, I've never...  I'm just saying  but don't make it look like  oh, when the guys are here  I'm saying  hey, I hate niggers  and then a black guy  comes in  and I'm like  hi, how are you, sir?  Because that's just  a blatant lie.  Yeah.  That is kind of  how you painted it.  It's not true. 
[02:13:00]  You don't like  what I'm saying  because you're not  used to hearing  white people  in this day and age  disagree with something  black people are doing  and say it.  No, it's fine  that you disagree.  I don't have a problem  with that.  She's saying that  when the people  are in studio  that we back away.  But when does  that discussion come up?  That's her whole point  here, really.  When does that discussion  come up  where we haven't had it?  Any discussion  you don't bring it up.  I'm just saying  you never bring it up.  Why do you feel  we should just  because the person's black? 
[02:13:30]  How about we'd rather  how about there's  10 things ahead of race  that we'd rather  talk to these guests about?  I think you saying  that we should  bring up race  just because  a guest is black  is fucking racist.  Anthony,  you bring up shit  just for black people  all the time.  I'm just saying  I hate to hear you guys  have a discussion  about what you think  is going on  with these black youth  and then you're like  and then never bring it up.  I'd love to continue this  but can we get to  that news story  about that shooting  outside that rap concert  this weekend? 
[02:14:00]  Wait, why do I  what's going on  with black youth?  Like, the only guy  who's allowed to talk  about it publicly  is the mayor of Philadelphia  because he's black.  He's the only one.  What's that?  The black youth  are going crazy.  We know that.  Black community knows  that they are acting  a fool.  I don't know why  they're acting like this.  Oh, okay.  So you don't know.  So obviously  you're telling me  that you don't know  as a black woman  so I'm assuming  you're black.  Didn't mean to make  that giant leap.  So why do you  Okay, so if you don't know Lonnie  why should I ask  a black guest  when he's in?  Why would he know 
[02:14:30]  anymore  why other individuals  are acting like assholes?  Because I say  I don't know  but I'm not  it's like some things  that are said  about how people  act and it's savage  and this and that.  I mean, come on.  Yeah, certain behaviors  are savage.  Right.  They really are.  Certain behaviors  the people aren't savage  or they're not savage  based on race  or religious background  but behaviors  are savage.  Certain behaviors  are savage.  If a guy is raping women  and punching them  in the face  he's a savage.  I've used plenty of  I've used the word savage 
[02:15:00]  talking about  Islamic radicals  more than I have  I think any other group  that I've called savage.  Anyone that will  blow themselves up  and blow up  innocent women  innocent people  heads off  while they're still alive  are savage.  That's savage behavior.  You're just taking it  very personally.  She's taking this  very personally, Jimmy.  Did it ever occur to you  that you're reading  more into it?  It's just, I don't know.  I guess I am.  I guess, whatever.  Look, I'm on the phone  with you.  I'm sorry, guys.  I mean, that's fine  but Jimmy, did you give 
[02:15:30]  the news thing credit  about the 13 people  that were killed?  They said two black guys  did it  but they always say  black guys did it, right?  They don't.  Lonnie, this is why  this is what drives me crazy.  What bothers me  and I even say this  it's not black people  removing this stuff  from the language  it's guilty whites.  It's whites  who are afraid  if they say the word black  that the way they really feel  about that word  is going to come out.  I can have this racial discussion  I would be comfortable  saying this  in a room full of black people  because I'm not afraid  of being exposed  as a racist 
[02:16:00]  because I'm not.  But there are things  in the language  that make me sick  and that's one of them.  I read a rape suspect  description  where they removed  they didn't mention  the guy's race  in the New York Daily News  or in all of these  flash mobs  if there are white victims  they don't mention  the race.  Black people are very  very rarely charged  with hate crimes.  Why?  Because the police department  don't want their stats  to go up  and the media  is too guilty  to call out  black and white crime  as being racially motivated. 
[02:16:30]  And that's white people  also not wanting  to acknowledge  that black people  are fucking pissed off  at them  and that's also  arrogant white people  intellectualizing  thinking they're  the only ones  capable of having  such devious motives  and black are more  meat and potatoes.  They're just doing  violence because  they're violent.  It's a subtle form  of liberal racism  as far as I see it.  Okay.  Well I appreciate  the conversation.  But I mean come on  but don't  it bothers me  that you would think  that I wouldn't have  the discussion  I would love to have  this discussion  with a black actor. 
[02:17:00]  It just wouldn't be  appropriate when Don Cheadle  walks in  who I'm a fucking fanboy  Just to blindside him  with race questions.  It's almost like  as much as I've talked  about politics and stuff  when Ozzy walks in here  do I talk about  fucking Islamic radicalism  when Ozzy Osbourne  is sitting here?  No I'm a fawning fairy.  I guess my thing is  when you know  a mob  a flash mob  went and stole  a whole bunch of stuff  do they really need  to say it was black people?  We all know  it was black people.  I know it was my people  that did that.  But do you listen to 
[02:17:30]  So what you're saying is  do we really need  to say it  when we all know it?  that's scary  because you're saying  don't say something  that's honest  because it's unpleasant  to hear.  It's not unpleasant  to hear  it's just a fact  that's just what's going on  you know  like there's certain  radio hosts  or radio stations  that play a game  of what race is this  and they literally  they list off the crime  that happened  and you have to guess  who it was.  That's an old  that's a hack bit  by the way.  But do you know  what you just said  what you just said 
[02:18:00]  do you understand  what you just said  is why  is absolutely  liberal racism  like you just said  well we all know  who's doing it  that is exactly  the way the media  looks at blacks  it's expected behavior  you don't even need  to say it  we're not surprised  that's exactly  you're feeding into that  it's not expected  but that's just  what's going on  but don't say it  what's wrong  right now with them  okay so we all  have to pretend  it's not happening  it's like the emperor's 
[02:18:30]  new clothes  pretend it's not happening  even though you're  a black woman  saying you know it  you're offended  if I say it  no I'm not  offended you're saying  I'm offended  you get so mad  that they're not  saying it's a black  person and it  seems like it's  a different motive  like why are you  so mad  they're not saying  it's a black person  because honestly  sweetheart I'm mad  because any type  of tampering with  the language  it's how I make  my living  it affects me  greatly  most people  don't understand  it because  they don't talk  for a living  but I noticed  this stuff  and I'm obsessed  with this stuff 
[02:19:00]  because way back  from Tough Crowd  I remember the notes  we would get  from their  standards and practices  department from Viacom  and you start to see  patterns on what  is allowed through  and what is going to  ah you might not  want to say that  ah you don't  and when you see  the pattern  it drives you crazy  that's what bothers me  about them not saying  black people  because when they say  it's white people  when a bunch of  white guys  commit a race crime  against a black person  I never once  am bothered  when they say  it's a white person  they should say that 
[02:19:30]  and boy you could  be bothered  20 times  because it's on  the cover of the paper  for two weeks straight  as opposed to  you know  a black on white crime  yes and that's not  black people doing that  that's fucking  that's white editors  making the decision  to scold  other white people  which is kind of  how parents  treat each other  as opposed to  treating the child  the same way  it's paternalism  and it drives me nuts  okay well  I have to go to work  because I do have a job  work  and I'm black  see  that wasn't me 
[02:20:00]  come on  that wasn't me  that was me  and if you can't  understand that  that's a joke  based on a stereotype  that we  that I  I bash all the time  please  what do you  what am I  fucking  Huntley Brinkley  over here  Lonnie  I just  that's why  I listen to this show  you guys are funny  I was just calling  Lonnie  really quickly  were you bothered  when those radio hosts  said that  Whitney Houston  was a crack hole  I didn't even hear it  but no  of course not 
[02:20:30]  because you're  you're a thinking person  you're at least thinking  at least the sensitivity  training is going to  really help  yeah but  who the fuck  would actually be bothered  you wouldn't want to  have to deal with  those people anyway  as a company  who cares  I think maybe  it's older black people  and that are  you know  bothered by that  I would  I wonder  I doubt it  I bet it's a very  very small minority  but for some reason  they have big voices  in this country  you can say whatever  you want  that's what it is  I think thinking  people heard  two radio guys  go ah  Whitney Houston  was you know 
[02:21:00]  crack hole  crack hole  and they're like  eh whatever  two guys just trying  to entertain  their stupid audience  hey come on  you're going to be  late for work  and you know  thank you Anthony  alright Lonnie  goodbye  goodbye  goodbye  I don't think  you brought up  a great point  there Jimmy  I don't think  the word nigger  has ever been  used on this  radio show  in anger  it has not once  yeah it's been  used in context  of somebody  using the word  in a news story  and then we  have to reiterate 
[02:21:30]  the way  rappers and  certain other  black people  talk  we've discussed  that and used  the word  but we've never  had somebody  walking down the  hall and then  blurted it out  in an offensive  manner  more importantly  how many times  did you want to  oh god  please  right now  but there's a  weird line with  that word  because you  can always  I don't use it  like when black  people are in  or I try not to  because there's a  way it drives me  nuts when somebody 
[02:22:00]  sneaks it in  in front of a black  person just to  Eddie Murphy years  ago called out  Dick Cavett on that  because Cavett did  it kind of gratuitously  they were having an  interview and I guess  Cavett was doing  word association  say I like to  fuck  no he didn't  say that  he said that  he goes  he looks at  Eddie Murphy  and he goes  nigger  and he goes  what does that  word mean to  you or something  and Eddie Murphy  mocked him  and said something  about yeah  do you see that  I said it right  in front of him  he didn't do  anything  he called Cavett  out on the way  he used it in 
[02:22:30]  front of him on  purpose  and I've never  forgotten that was  30 years ago  wow that's pretty  cool  do we have a  clip of that  I would love to  see that  I don't like  sneaking it in  even though of  course you can  and if it's called  for in a discussion  I would say it  but to me  there's something  there's something  about just saying  in front of a  black guy  where you know  he can't do  anything  that it's just  kind of  eh we both  know what  you're doing  let's go to  Steve in Houston  yeah that is a  silly way to  pop it in there  good morning  gentlemen  how you doing  hi Steve  we've talked to  you before  I think  I've never 
[02:23:00]  been able to  oh but you're  saying he sounds  exactly like  god you all  sound the same  jesus  oh my  nice opie  nice  anyway jimmy  I just wanted  to call you  out before  done  came in  you did  make a  reference  stating the  people at  shade 45  as monkeys  or something  of that nature  so don't  play this  shit  I said  what  you said  something  about  the monkeys  across the  hall  that's  absolutely  not true  jimmy would  never  fucking 
[02:23:30]  say that  no one  in this  studio  would say  that  that's  100%  wrong  pull the  clip  find the  fucking  clip  you got  the clip  it was  never said  nope  yes you  did  yes you  did  brett  let me  tell you  something  yes you  did  if you're  telling me  that I  said  people in  shade 45  are monkeys  no  no  you  the actual  term  that you  use  you said  something  about  monkeys  it was  something  said  with  monkeys  and  things  you said  no we  can just  go across  the hall  it was  implied  and we  all know  that  shade 45  is across  and so 
[02:24:00]  is  Martha Stewart  is across  the hall  and so  of the  fucking  gay  channel  I don't  believe you  I don't  believe you  and then of  course  Anthony  hits this  little  bill  like he  always  does  but we  all know  what that  means  cut the  bullshit  what I  do  yo man  what I  do  why you  gonna do  me like  this  how are we  gonna find  that clip  now I'm  curious  what the  guy's  referencing  you rock  what we  got  what we  got  Steve  is that  it  I just 
[02:24:30]  wanted to  add that  I love  you guys  I love  the show  I'm  African  American  all of  us are  not lazy  I hated  that  I don't  believe  that you  are entitled  to say  what you  want  but you  also have  to take  sometimes  there's  repercussions  behind that  it fucking  sucks  I'm in my  job right  now  I close  my office  door  I can't  go in  my office  yes  I'm a  businessman  but I  can't go  I can't  I can't  go  he was  born a  slave  but he  died  a  businessman  I love  that  commercial 
[02:25:00]  Steve  loves it  too  that  commercial  rules  oh my  god  I  fucking  love  it  fuck  man  I love  it guys  man  like I  say  every morning  y'all make  the drive  in easier  y'all give  it  but Jimmy  you are  kind of  foolish  hit on  this  when  you  kind  of  said  some  sneak  things  in  before  and  sometimes  it's just  in the name  of comedy  which is  great  and you're  funny as fuck 
[02:25:30]  thank you  but that woman  calling up and  saying that I've  said  blacks are  savages and  blacks are  it's just not  I've never  said that  but a lot  you've never  said blacks are  savages  this and that  but a lot  of times  we general  dialogue  whether you  read a story  or whatever  and we hear  the bell  ring  and then  you're talking  about the  vagary  that happens  at times  yes  but hey  look  if there's  vagary  deniability  you can't  just fill 
[02:26:00]  in the blanks  and say  Jim that's  definitely  what you  meant  you can't  just fill  in the blanks  and tell  people that's  exactly what  they meant  you just  can't do it  you don't  think it's  that calculated  my friend  come on  you are  in the radio  business  where everything  is taped  and you've  got to  protect yourself  from a legal  perspective  I understand  that  but you know  and I know  that there's  times when y'all  go for the  cheat joke  and it's  it's right  there  you can't  help it  dude we  made a living  on cheap  jokes  our whole  fucking radio  show is a 
[02:26:30]  cheap joke  we do a lot  of cheap  jokes here  it's what  we're built  on  it's a  foundation  of cheap  jokes  but I  was only  annoyed  at her  saying  that I  wouldn't  have that  racial  discussion  with Don  if he  would have  brought up  race  I would  absolutely  have had  that  discussion  I don't  care  who it  is  I agree  with that  why the  hell  should a  black  person  walk in  you immediately  go through  the whole  race  conversation  I hate  it  when every  time I'm  around my  white  co-workers  they feel  as if I  have to  reprimand  I'm the  supposed to  first fall 
[02:27:00]  black people  I kind of  hate that  shit at  times  but it is  the way  it is  you know  how awkward  that would  have been  if he just  comes in  let's say  a guest  regular  John  Johnson  I would  be very  interested  to talk  about social  issues  with those  guys  but there's  something  it's like  out of  character  to why  they're  here  and it's  weird  to just  go so  what do  think about  the blacks  behaving  so he'd  go like  what  why are you  asking me  that  and then  there's  the chance  that'll  take  knock all  your teeth  out  but that's  it's just  an awkward  why is it  that we  always got  to retaliate 
[02:27:30]  with violence  come on  man  well no  John Jones  is just  a tough  guy  he's a UFC  guy  he might  do that  because that's  what he  does when  he wakes  up  I don't  know  he's a  bad  motherfucker  but anyway  gentlemen  I have to  get back  to work  and you  guys enjoy  your day  what kind  of business  I'm actually  the engineering  manager for  a chemical  company  pharmaceuticals  god you guys  got fancy  names now  crystal meth  crystal meth  is a fucking  is a white 
[02:28:00]  thing  that's a white  guy drug  fair enough  yeah  anyway  alright Steve  take it easy  alright Steve  any of the  black people  want to call  up and accuse  me of racism  exactly  that was a  good discussion  good call  what is this  it's like the  third degree  I got fish  to fry  there's a  Q&A  Uncle Junior  is in that  break time  Kirk Cameron  when we get  back  you don't  like the  gee  we got the  clips  I haven't

[02:30:30]  go on to  Kirk Cameron  he doesn't  like the  gay  he doesn't  like the  gay  his god  has said  don't like  the gay  he's paying  attention to  his god  well but  me thinks  he might  have some  feelings  you think  he's  covering  up  me thinks  he might  have some  feelings  that he  doesn't  understand  I always  thought he  was gay  I mean  I'm not  but I  always  thought he  was  I think  the people  that yell  and scream 
[02:31:00]  about this  stuff the  loudest  there's always  something going  on deep  inside  themselves  I believe  inside  don't you  think  yeah I've  always been  from that  skew of  thought  I think  in the end  who gives  a fuck  really  who gives  a fuck  I could  care less  about what  the gay  is doing  but I mean  if you're  basically saying  that he  said  homosexuality  is unnatural  and gay  marriage is  destructive  to civilization  that makes  me think  that there's  something going  on in his  head  that is  bothersome 
[02:31:30]  maybe some  feelings that  pop up  did you see  the brilliant  Colin Quinn's  tweets last  night about  this  it's supposed  to be Adam  and Eve  not  and then he  would go  it was all  kinds of  different takes  on the Adam  and Steve  thing  I saw Adam  and Biebs  Adam and  Biebs  Adam and  Jeeves  I saw  yeah  there were  a whole  shit load  of them  and the  fact that  Colin retweets  the people  that bash  him  and these  people come  off like  complete  idiots  how do 
[02:32:00]  they not  get it  how do  they not  understand  it's  Colin  Quinn  first of  all  he didn't  turn into  an asshole  over fucking  night  and start  tweeting  like  ridiculous  things  that's  his  bit  it's  hilarious  and believe  me I'm not  even blowing  his spot  up because  there are  so many  stupid  people out  there  they will  still bitch  and complain  about Colin  Quinn's  tweets  twitter has  made me realize  that there are  a lot of  dumbbells out  there  they cry  when you block  them  why do you  block me 
[02:32:30]  it's like  why do you  care  you're gonna  be a cunt  I'm gonna  block  why do you  care  I don't  care  if you  ever  acknowledge  me again  why do  you need  to read  what I  write  and don't  ever ask  me to  unblock  you  because  first of  all  I don't  remember  why I  blocked  you  but  I'm  sure  it was  a good  reason  I  unblocked  one guy  because he  wrote me  an email  and he  goes look  I was  on pain  medication  and it  was actually  a cool  so I  unblocked  him  or did  I might  have  forgotten  I've 
[02:33:00]  I love  when  I'm not  even  following  your  conversations  and you've  yelled and  screamed  or whatever  and then  they start  hitting me  up  saying  can you  talk  to some  senses  to Anthony  like why  is he  blocking  me  I'm  like he  doesn't  talk  to me  why am  I  going  to talk  to him  I  would  if you  came  to me  with  unblocking  someone  I  would  block  you  in  a second  Twitter  is  given  on  the  dummies  voice 
[02:33:30]  and I  don't  know  but  they're  being  shut  down  their  dummy  voices  because  I  just  block  them  I  can't  take  it  I  post  some  shit  sometimes  as a  complete  goof  joke  sarcasm  and people  just  don't  get it  and  actually  take  what I  said  verbatim  and seriously  and comment  on it  it's like  verbatim  and it's like  what the fuck  are you  talking  are you  that  dumb  and apparently  yes  they are  it's like  if you're  a dick  to me  on Twitter  I've  never  blocked  anybody  for  disagreeing  with me  but if 
[02:34:00]  there's  a cunty  tone  it's like  you're  saying that  to me  that's like  you're  heckling me  in a club  so I'll  just block  you  what else  am I  gonna do  most times  you're not  using your  real name  you're not  using your  real face  there's no  picture  you're some  anonymous  jerk off  so I'm  supposed to  just sit  there and  read your  disapproval  go fuck  yourself  why should  I have  to read  your words  of fucking  wisdom  every day  if I block  you  you can say  what you  want  I'm not  stopping  you  go ahead  no one's  gonna say  what you  want  yeah they  have every  right to  tweet  whatever  they want  they have  three followers 
[02:34:30]  but uh  when you're  you know  of course  you're gonna  get blocked  and there's  nothing wrong  with that  but then  they can't  believe it  they're like  they're thinking  but I want  to be able  to be this  anonymous person  with a fake  name and say  whatever I want  that you have  to acknowledge  and I don't  like when I  can't be  heard  I could see  you being  mad if I  removed your  right to  Twitter  then you got  a right to  bitch because  that's me  infringing on  your right  all I'm  saying is  fuck you  I'm not  gonna read  it I  don't have  to read  your shit  right  too bad 
[02:35:00]  baby  or else  don't be a  scumbag  when you  at mention  me  if people  I've never  ever blocked  anybody for  going look  I don't think  you're right  about this  never  it's when  there's a  cunty or  shitty uh  tone to it  that I  block them  it's like  go fuck  yourself  just don't  cry about  it after  you want  to be a  jerk off  be the  anonymous  jerk off  you are  with your  fake Twitter  picture and  then don't  fucking cry  about it  when you're  no longer  allowed to  at mention  and if that  happened in  a club  you'd have  them removed  because you  know you 
[02:35:30]  would have  to  because there's  a difference  between somebody  who disagrees  with you who's  a fan and  you know that  and when  somebody is  just being a  jerk off  and I love  when the  jerk offs  cry  yeah  you fucking  oh you pussy  you don't want  to fucking  no I don't  you know what  I'm learning  today that I'm  not the only  one that gets  hate tweets  this is so  refreshing I  thought it was  just me  I don't block  that often  when I do  the funny thing  is when you  discuss this  with all the  people you  realize that  it's just  all encompassing  there are a lot 
[02:36:00]  of just fucking  complete assholes  out there just  spewing hate  tweets to every  person they  could fucking  find  to their  three or  four followers  I have a lot  of people that  are disagreeing  with me today  on the thing  because I'm  attacking liberals  there's a lot  of people  disagreeing  with me  excuse me  I'm not  blocking all  them I'm  just blocking  the couple  that are  absolute  jerk offs  yeah  if you don't  agree with me  I'm not  blogging  it's your  paraca  yeah of  course  I'm on  twitter  just because  it's just  fun  and I just  like trying to  keep it as  fun as  possible  simple as  that 
[02:36:30]  police  someone just  tweeted me  this black  teenagers light  13 year old  on fire  you get what  you deserve  white boy  is that from  drudge  check drudge  I don't know  if that's a  true treat  or not  that is true  is it  yeah  that's a  big story  today  wow  yep  well hopefully  I'm sure  Reverend Al  will talk  about that  and um  oh that's  right  he'll condemn  it I'm  sure  I hope Lonnie's  not mad that  I'm mentioning  this  where is that  Putin  good thing  Putin's  there  thank god  Putin got  reelected  Putin  yeah 
[02:37:00]  it seems like  the election's  a little more  legitimate though  because it was  a little closer  I love those  elections overseas  where it's  99%  yeah 99%  they love him  got 99%  of the vote  not anymore  I think he only  had like 58  so yeah  so they're not  faking it as  as much as  they used to  oh  what happened  first degree burns  this is  this is this  the boy was  taken a 13 year  old boy police  said was doused  with gasoline  and lit on fire  while walking 
[02:37:30]  home from school  is recovering  with first degree  burns to his  face and head  the boy was  just two blocks  from home  in Kansas City  when two teenagers  began to follow him  and then attacked him  his mother  Melissa Kuhn  said  oh no  police have  described the  suspects as  black 16 year olds  while the victim  is white  we were told  it's a hate crime  Kuhn told  KTLA  they rushed him  on the porch  as he tried  to get the door  open  one of them  poured gasoline  and flicked a bick  this is what you 
[02:38:00]  deserve  you get what  you deserve  white boy  they must not  elect his name  they fucking  lit this kid  on and again  they are mentioning  the racial difference  because it was very  it was a hate crime  committed  and they said  white boy  in it  wait the white  kid's name is  Kuhn  yeah  why does that  always work out  with some of  these stories  I don't know  it's so weird  so weird  what's even  odder is the  black guy's names  were responsible  I'm actually  looking at the  story like a  literal idiot  earthquake 
[02:38:30]  where's it  earthquake  big earthquake  breaking  San Francisco  the wrestler  might be San  Francisco  is this it  finally  we got  finally the big  one  trending topic  earthquake  and then San  Francisco  a 4.3  magnitude earthquake  has struck  that's easy  they laugh at  4.3's out there  don't they  yeah  we would be  earthquake  warning  no  Iraq  just say it  on the air  what  Iraq 
[02:39:00]  yes  comment  I was just  saying  did you want  the earthquake  warning  that's all  okay  I said no  oh no  if we had a  4.3 in New York  we'd all cry  like bitches  oh it'd be  crazy  do you feel  that  guaranteed  where were you  when that  happened  we would cry  like bitches  the last big  one in Frisco  and that wasn't  even a big  big one  wasn't that  that one  that happened  during a  world series  oh shit  that goes way  back  yeah  that was  a long time  ago  nothing that  big  that brought  down those 
[02:39:30]  remember the  highway  fucking  collapsed  on the other  highway  pancaked  yeah  good old  pancake  that was crazy  alright so let's  get back to  Kurt Cameron  he's on  Piers Morgan  I don't know  why  Piers  do you follow  Piers on the  Twitter  ah he's a  fucking  he stinks  on Twitter  I follow him  but  there's so many  people on Twitter  that have so many  fucking followers  and they just  stink  Howard Stern  stinks on Twitter  Piers Morgan  stinks on Twitter  pictures of the  girlie there 
[02:40:00]  he stinks though  he should have  more to offer  Twitter than what  he does  I like the photos  yeah  and Piers talks  talks a little  soccer  I don't know  you know who's  terrible to follow  because you just  remember him as  well George  Costanza  right  Jason Alexander  there you go  he's another  terrible  is he bad  because it's so  it's the complete  opposite of  George Costanza  and you just want  to remember  George Costanza  you know  kind of like  ah it's George  but no  he's not George  he's Jason 
[02:40:30]  Alexander  liberal  there's a lot  of them  a lot of people  that really  don't have much  to tweet  hey  this guy  don't kill  the messenger  Sam  here's a guy  he says  if a 4.3  hit New York  we'd all cry  like Fezzies  we would all  cry like Fezzies  no reason for it  how's Fezz doing  these days  still sounding good  I don't know  I heard he went  to the hospital  yeah he's been  sick a little bit  people are like  why aren't you  tweeting well wishes 
[02:41:00]  to Fezz  I didn't even know  he was in the hospital  what happened  I'm not exactly sure  what's been said  on the air  off the air  oh okay  that's good  see  what you have  some inside info  I don't know  if it's inside  or not  you're not a rat  you had some  ticker problems  I see you pointing  at your chest  I'm not pointing  at anything  I'm scratching my nose  I don't know  what's been said  on the air  or not  I don't know  what's inside  or not  write it down  for us  none of my bidness  you don't want  to blow up  anybody's spot  on the air  write it down  for us  at least  what do you have  some chest pains  I read some 
[02:41:30]  tweets  I mean it might  have been said  on the air  obviously  I hope  Fezz is doing well  oh  what  I think  oh  you know  well  surgery  to become a  what  that's  that's really  he's really  leapfrogging now  wow  really  did he pick out  a girl name yet  and can I 
[02:42:00]  can I  can I say something  people get really mad  but the beauty  of this show  and Rana Fezz  all this comes out  in the end  but it's not  we're not at  liberty to say  that shit  but you'll  you'll find out  it'll come out  oh they said it  on air  I guess  that's what  Eric's telling me  you sure  yeah I just  spoke with Pepper  that's what  they said on air  he had three  more stents  put in  wow  damn  that's a lot  of stents  new Fezz  he's gonna come  back stronger  than ever though 
[02:42:30]  yeah  Robo Fezz  yeah  Kirk Cameron  homosexuality is  unnatural and gay  marriage is  destructive to  civilization  this is from  Piers Morgan  we got the  clip so let's  listen in now  if I asked you  for example  what your view  of gay marriage  is what would  you say  go ahead and  ask me  what is your  view of gay  marriage  I feel like I  just got imported  into the  Christine O'Donnell  interview you did  back in August  well I mean  that was a  interview where  she wouldn't  talk about stuff  in her own book  I know  I'm just saying 
[02:43:00]  these issues  are interesting  to me about  what you would  tell your kids  who you're  trying to  protect for  example  would you  tell them  that gay  marriage is  a sin  I would  tell my  children  as I  tell them  what I  believe myself  and dealing  with these  social issues  whether it's  abortion  or gay  marriage  I believe  that marriage  was defined  by God  a long time  ago  marriage is  almost as old  as dirt  and it was  defined in the  garden  between Adam 
[02:43:30]  and Eve  one man  one woman  for life  till death  do you part  so I would  never attempt  to try to  redefine marriage  and I don't  think anyone  else should  either  so do I  support the  idea of  gay marriage  no I  don't  do you think  homosexuality  is a sin  I think  that it's  unnatural  I think  that it's  detrimental  and ultimately  destructive  to so many  of the  foundations  of civilization  so what  do you  do  if  one  of  your  six  kids 
[02:44:00]  says  dad  bad  news  I'm  gay  good  question  I'm not  going to  do a  hypothetical  situation  I'd sit down  and have a  heart to heart  with them  just like you  would with your  kids  if one of my  sons said that  I'd say  that's great  son  no you wouldn't  happy  I think he  would  he would  be supportive  there'd still  be part of  him that  would be  like fuck  man  rather have  the kid  that wants  to play  it's probably  not choice  number one  but basically  what he's  saying is  that he  would support  him  Kirk Cameron 
[02:44:30]  did nothing  wrong though  he was asked  his opinion  he didn't  offer it  he was kind  of goaded  into give  you can't fault  a guy  I'm not  faulting  not you  I'm saying  people in  general  the gay  people  look I get  it you don't  like what he  said  but you  can't  bash the  guy  when  Piers  Morgan  says  what's  your  opinion  and he  gives  it  you can't  fault him  for that  is he  supposed to  lie  sit there  and not  be honest  about how  he feels  people are  not happy 
[02:45:00]  with what  he said  which is  fine too  I just  think the  guy's a  twat  I think  he's a  twat  as well  I really  do  and I  think  that  fundamentalist  or whatever  Christian  thinking  stinks  and it's  corny  and it's  idiotic  and I  think it's  inconsistent  the fact  that marriage  is defined  by God  really  God cares  where you  stick your  dick  and he  just threw  a baby  through a  twister  and killed  the whole  family  really  same guy  god  Jimmy  bravo  same guy  I mean  I don't  get it  you fucking  you religious  people  they explain  away  everything 
[02:45:30]  bad  and everything  good is  because God  loves them  it's like  that woman  standing there  begging the  twister to  avoid her  house  is exactly  what religion  is in the  whole  it's like  do this  for me  do this  for me  fuck  everybody  else  she didn't  say God  take the  twister  back  no  move it  away  from this  town  fuck  everybody  else  the religious  game  is based  completely  on  you have  to have  faith  that even  the bad  shit  that's being  done to 
[02:46:00]  you  there's  this  wacky  reason  that you  can't  understand  in life  you know  once you  go over  to the  other  side  everything  will be  explained  to you  you'll  understand  why  you had  hardships  why  it's so  secretive  because  it's the  only way  it works  it's the  only way  the game  of religion  works  is that  the bad  things  that happen  to you  have to  be  mysterious  secret  and there  has to  be some  underlying  reason  that you  just aren't  wise enough  as a  regular  human 
[02:46:30]  to  understand  or else  if the  truth of  the matter  was  well  because  sometimes  God  don't  like  you  and  he's  going  to  smite  you  and  your  family  you'd  sit  there  and  go  well  fuck  that  fuck  this  God  but  they've  worded  things  and  conditioned  you  to think  that even  when bad  things  happen  when your  fucking  kid  is  taken  from  you  or  your  mother  or  horrible  thing  happens  to  you  that  it's  still  God  loving  you  but  this  is 
[02:47:00]  a  test  or  it's  some  way  that  you  had  to  pay  something  for  something  you  did  or  don't  worry  in the  afterlife  it's  all  going to  be made  up  for you  that's  the only  way  it  works  is  this  blind  faith  that  you  have  to  follow  for  this  all  knowing  all  loving  God  that  does  horrible  things  to  people  but  it'll  be  explained  to you  in  the  next  chapter  I  guess  Saint  Seinfeld  is a  bad  Twitter  guy  too  huh  getting  a little  list  together  he  doesn't  tweet  much  so  right  Jerry  ain't 
[02:47:30]  that  good  either  gotta be  honest  with  you  he  doesn't  tweet  much  yeah  yeah  yeah  I'm  with you  on that  yeah  here's  more  from  Piers  Morgan  that's  great  son  as long  as you're  happy  what would  you say  well  I wouldn't  say that's  great son  as long  as you're  happy  I'm gonna  say  you know  there's  there's  all sorts  of issues  that we  need to  wrestle  through  in our  life  and  just  because  you  feel  one  way  doesn't  mean  we  should  act  on  everything  that  we  feel  but  some  people  would  say  that 
[02:48:00]  that  in  itself  is  incredibly  destructive  and damaging  this is  what bugs  me  and I  understand  it's a  real  interview  don't  say  some  people  would  say  you're  in a  one  on  one  discussion  just  say  what  you  would  say  that's  an  interviewer's  way  of getting  somebody  else  to say  stuff  without  you  debating  them  well  Jimmy  some  people  would  say  you're  stupid  right  now 
[02:48:30]  they'd  be  right  who  called  out  the  media  on  that  was  it  Newt  Gingrich  or  yeah  we  played  the clip  on our  show  because  an  interviewer  who  was it  that was  Mitt Romney  was it  Romney  wasn't  smart  enough  for that  the one  who said  what's  his name  what's  his name  what's  his name  I think  that was  Rick Perry  oh  Rick Perry  it was  Perry  okay  good  yeah  because  the media  does this  all the  time  I'm glad  Jimmy's  bringing  this up  where it's  not on  them  it's like  oh  people  are  saying  and  fucking  Perry  goes  who are  the  people 
[02:49:00]  and  we'll  name  the  people  or  I'm  not  answering  your  question  nailed  the  guy  getting  married  is a  sin  or  whatever  that  in itself  is incredibly  destructive  and damaging  in a country  where seven  states now  have legalized  it  yes  but  but you  have to  also  understand  that  that  you  yourself  are  using  a  standard  of  morality  to say  that  telling  people  such  and such  of a  behavior  is sinful  you're  using  a  standard  of  morality  to  make  that  statement  and say 
[02:49:30]  that  that  is  terribly  destructive  so  everyone  is going  to have  a  standard  against  which  they  I'm  not  an  American  I'm  making  the  point  that  seven  states  in  America  have  now  legalized  gay  marriage  well  Kirk Cameron  again  made a  good  point  there  he's  basically  saying  you're  going  by  your  standard  of  morality  and  I'm  going  by  mine  I  mean  if  you  ask  I  think  he's  a  douche  yeah  why  because  he  feels  that  way  but  you  did  ask  at 
[02:50:00]  least  he's  giving  you  real  answers  I  feel  sorry  I  wouldn't  want  a  father  like  that  with  such  a  closed  minded  way  of  thinking  imagine  if  one  of  his  kids  is  gay  and  peers  did  say  that  he  was  brave  to  say  that  I  kind  of  like  where  peers  didn't  throw him  under  the  bus  after  he  said  he  was  brave  and  I  think  that's  right  as  a  father  sorry  to  bring  this  into  but  if  my 
[02:50:30]  you  having  a  son  that  you  care  about  you  start  thinking  like  god  man  his  future  is  going  to  be  very  difficult  with  this  lifestyle  so  you  care  in  that  way  you  don't  necessarily  have  to  be  like  I  hate  gay  people  fuck  you  you  better  start 
[02:51:00]  going  out  with  but  there  will  be  things  as  a  parent  just  because  you  love  your  child  that  you  would  look  at  and  go  this  is  but  I  would  absolutely  fully  support  that  that  would  be  rough  man  first  fucking  christmas  with  a  boyfriend  brings  him  over  kissy  face  at  the  table  that  is  hard  it's  trying to  fuck  the  turkey  but  there's  asshole  fathers  out  there 
[02:51:30]  that  would  act  on  you  know  that  shit  I  gotta  suck  it  up  and  support  my  kid  that  is  support  you're  speaking  to a  man  who  is  a  Christian  and  I  believe  that  all  of  us  are  sinful  I  could  stand  at  the  top  of  the  list  and  say  that  I  need  a  savior  and  I  need  an  overhaul  of  the  heart  more  than  anyone  and  so  that's  what I  teach  my  kids  I  teach  them  the  values  that  I  hold  dear  I  treasure  the  God  that  loves  me 
[02:52:00]  end  yeah  isn't  it  all  relative  it  would  be  one  thing  if  you  knew  there's  a  whole  mass  amount  of  people  out  there  that  have  never  sinned  then  you're  like  oh  fuck  I'm  the  asshole  here  but  if  we're  all  sinning  then  it  should  cancel  out  everyone's  sins  that's  what I'm  thinking  we all  know  it  is  the  Jew  exactly  I love  people  it all  comes  back  to  Jews  stupid  white  supremacists  we got  we heard  you  we heard 
[02:52:30]  you  it's  the  Jew  we got  it  assholes  I'll tell  you this  much  Kirk  Cameron  is  believe  what  he  believes  what  he  believes  he's  well  informed  on the  issue  where he  stands  anyway  I think  his  opinion  is  stupid  but  he  can  have  it  and  then  he  moves  on  and  talks  about  abortion  which  is  a  hot  topic  which  oddly  enough  he  is  totally  for  yeah  but  forcefully  with a  sidekick  barbarically  so  yeah  it's got  to be  natural  what's 
[02:53:00]  your view  of abortion  I think  that it's  wrong  under any  circumstances  even rape  and sex  I think  that someone  who  you know  I don't  understand  where it's  wrong  in every  instance  in rape  like a woman's  raped  she should  be forced  to have  a baby  I know  this is  one of  those  sensitive  topics  and all  but  yeah  a woman  is just  minding  her own  business  going out  to a  parking lot  let's  say  she gets  raped  and now  you want  to force  her to  have that  nine months  later  like what  what kind 
[02:53:30]  of dummy  are you  I don't  understand  that  and I  never  will  oh he  has your  father's  deranged  eyes  exactly  and she's  got to  look at  the eyes  that might  look like  the eyes  that were  staring at  her when  he was  raping  her  her life  should  stop  and her  body  should  change  and she  should  force  this  thing  out of  her  pussy  after  some  guy  forced  it  into  her  God  works  in  mysterious  ways  I wonder  if Kirk  Cameron  would feel  that way  if his  wife was  getting  raped  maybe  he would  say his  wife was  raped  in a  parking  lot  by somebody 
[02:54:00]  he's a  cuck  and uh  yeah  would he  enjoy it  or would  he say  that she  should be  able to  get rid  of that  or maybe  not  no honey  God  God has  a reason  for you  to have  been  they pray  over it  they'd cry  over it  and then  they'd have  the baby  and you  know  this  suffering  seems to  be a  very big  part of  religion  yeah  people  if they're  having too  good a  time  you're  doing  something  wrong  in the  eyes  of  your  God  and this  is pretty  much  every  fucking  religion  out there  which is  I don't  get it  why the hell 
[02:54:30]  should we  sacrifice a  good time  here  for this  you know  this is like  fucking  let's make  a deal  you could  have a  good time  here  on this  plane  of life  or trade  it in  for the  box  that God  is standing  by  ah  good time  now  fucking  this  or  some  mysterious  box  that I  ah  what if  I get  zonked  then you  completely  waste your  life  doing nothing  and why would  you guilt a  woman into  having the  kid  being raped  alone  has got to  be just  emotionally  brutal 
[02:55:00]  that you  never get  over  now you're  now you're  guilting her  into having  the kid  and you don't  even realize  that  Jimmy brought up  something  very good  a lot of  women  it takes  a lifetime  to get  over a  rape  or even  to not  get over  but to  deal with  it  to bring  yourself  where you  can deal  with it  it at least  takes years  of counseling  and being able  to accept  what happened  nine months  later  you now  have to  have a  kid  that reminds  you of  the rapist  that isn't  quite enough  time 
[02:55:30]  to make  you a  healthy  human  if we  talk  to one  of these  hardcore  anti-abortion  what would  they say  about that  pray  pray  god  why  do they  feel  that way  because  life is  a life  you don't  have any  right to  take it  that's  god's  job  that's  their  whole  selling  point  we're  wasting  life  all the  time  well  that's  bad  in  their  eyes  too  but  why  do  they  feel  like  that  oh  because  they're  assholes  that's  why  they're  absolute  assholes  but there's  a lot  of people  that 
[02:56:00]  especially  in rape  and incest  how could  you think  millions  of sperm  in us  right now  that'll never  see the  light of  day  oh well  let's see  the light  of day  on the  floor  before it  gets the  darkness  of the  tissue  as long  as they  don't see  the darkness  of a  mustache  that would  suck  if you  were an  individual  sperm  yeah  ending up  on a  mustache  yeah  oh god  and you  don't realize  until you're  coming out  of the  cockhead  you didn't 
[02:56:30]  even waste  me on a  fucking  fucking  broad  your owner  you hear  and you  don't realize  it's the  guy whose  balls you're  in is doing  poppers  and as  you're rushing  out you're  like wow  I'm going  out way  too fast  you don't  realize  you're  expertly  being sucked  out by  a gentleman  with a  backwards  baseball hat  that's funny  really funny  what's your  view of  abortion  I think  that it's  wrong  under any  circumstances  even rape 
[02:57:00]  an insect  I think  that someone  who is  ultimately  willing to  murder a  child  even to  fix another  tragic  and devastating  situation  like rape  or incest  or things  like that  is not  taking the  moral high  road  I think  that we're  compounding  the problem  by also  murdering a  little child  could you  honestly  look a  daughter in  the eye  if she was  raped and  say you  have got to  have that  child  yes and I  will help  you  yes  of course 
[02:57:30]  I find  that amazing  what an  absolute  what a  piece of  shit  what a  fucking  piece of  shit  it's a  complete  commitment  to the  point of  throwing away  your life  and this is how  people that aren't  religious look at it  throwing away your  life on some  mystery package  that you might get  later on but to  them it's yeah  I don't he  doesn't care so  much what is  happening in this  life so if his  daughter gets  raped and has to  have a kid from 
[02:58:00]  a rapist this  life to him is  just a it's a  thing to praise  God and get in  touch with the  Lord enough so  that when he  dies he could be  there at the  right hand so  you got to go from  the mindset of he  doesn't see this  like we see it  yeah I see this  plane of existence  totally with you I  get it this plane of  existence for him is  for suffering and  for paying your  your tab so you  can then enjoy  your time price  of admission yes  your price of  admission to the  kingdom I'm 
[02:58:30]  certainly crazy yeah  I don't I don't  know I don't know  what there is after  this but I mean  this organized  religion is doesn't  seem to be the  exact fucking thing  this this  interpretation out  there if there  were missing out  on if there is  some time to read  the Bible and just  go this is this  is literally the  word of God word  of God I never  believe that I'm  like no man who  wrote this book  were there other  shit involved you  know where are we  at if there's some  type of God I  honestly don't  believe in my 
[02:59:00]  horrid little  brain that that  life would be put  on a planet with  so many resources  and so many great  things and for us  to look but look  but don't touch  you know to not be  able to enjoy  yourself why bother  living if the whole  time you're gonna be  tested and worry  about guilt and  everything else  next phase that's  exhausting how  about to give my  life to someone  else no thank  you I don't want  to go through  life being tested  the whole time  why make things 
[02:59:30]  fun then right  why do you got to  tempt us with a  millions is this  game it's some  type of fucking  game you put all  kinds of fun shit  around us and that  if we fuck around  with it we're  condemned Jesus that  sounds great for  what in the end  for a game because  no one really has  explained it that'd  be a fantastic game  imagine if you're  God and you got to  play with fucking  people like that  drop fucking two  naked bitches that  want to fuck this  married guy so bad  go ahead oh we 
[03:00:00]  went for it ha ha  condemned it's crazy  to think that there's  a God that's doing  this he seems a bit  twisted a bit fucking  twisted I mean we  got the story  everyone's talking  about the kid that  went flying what  what right the kid  wasn't even two I  don't think a mile  away from the house  and the tornado the  whole family's dead  and then God  teases a little  bit like oh  guess what the  baby survived and  then you're like you  breathe a sigh of  relief and go oh  that's right no now  he's dead dead or  she I don't know if  she was a miracle  baby yeah it was a 
[03:00:30]  miracle for a day  no no but it was a  miracle wipe the  whole family out  yeah throw this kid  13 miles oh it's a  miracle miracle but  getting back to God  is twisted you know  how twisted it is to  have a baby survive a  tornado and get  thrown out of the  house and then you  go nah fuck it I'm  gonna kill the baby  anyway hey Reaper come  here a minute yeah  oh oh you were  doing something all  right go back and  finish I'll I'll talk  to you later let them  think it's a miracle  baby for a day okay  sorry Jesus it's uh 
[03:01:00]  you really can twist  your fucking mind up  thinking about it I  would love to know  what happens to people  like Kurt Cameron that  puts them in the  position where they're  vulnerable to just eat  this shit up fucking  just eat it up and  and just take it and  and completely commit  themselves to it we're  lucky that we live in  part of the country that  isn't crazed over it I 
[03:01:30]  think it's something to do  with other parts of life  experience but there are  other parts of this  country you that they  are crazed about there's  a million Kirk  Cameron's they're cloned  all over the place  yeah they're raised like  that you're right we see  the religious shit in New  York what happened to  Kirk but not some of  these places you live it's  insane how they think did  someone say Sarah from  Buffalo says that Rick  Santorum said rape babies  should be treated as  gifts from God think it  was a CBS interview so  let me get this right they  couldn't have said that  maybe he did so let me get 
[03:02:00]  this right though if it's a  gift from God how about if  somebody breaks into your  house and rapes your wife  and holds you at gunpoint  and rapes your wife now why  would that be a crime in your  mind if that rapist is the  vehicle being used to  provide a gift from God  well that's true if it's  something so good since  everything happens for a  reason maybe God needed  this baby inside so why  would it be against the law  Rick for someone to break 
[03:02:30]  into your house and rape  your wife if that's what  you said God rapes in  mysterious ways Jimmy he  really does no but maybe  that maybe the gift from God  is that woman his wife and  the rapist are going to  have a baby that is going  to go on to someday have a  child who will do great  thing great thing so maybe  that's God's plan so if  this rapist is just a  vehicle serving God why  should he go to prison  couldn't God have worked it  out where the rapist and  maybe the rapist kisses the 
[03:03:00]  wife at the you know at the  dance some something like  that I just guys saying so  if the baby survived God  is great but since it  died God jamming under the  sea dance isn't bad why  did he oh I see what  they're saying gotcha yeah  if the baby survived  everyone would be like  look what God did God is  great yeah but since he  killed the baby they're not  saying God is bad they're  just going oh that's never  bad that's his his way  is this the clip the 
[03:03:30]  Santorum clip hear this baby  I don't want to misquote the  guy on abortion you did  harden your position on that  as you love talking about  abortion yeah why was  abortion well uh life you  know it's bigger to run for  public life I was informed  very quickly people wanted  to know what my position on  that was so I actually  doggy process of trying to  better understand the facts  it became very cool to me  that life begins at  conception and other things  persons are covered by the  constitution since life is a  people a human life is the 
[03:04:00]  same as a person to me it  was pretty simple uh deduction  to make that that's what the  constitution clearly intended to  protect uh but do you pause  that real quick oh there  were by the way that's an  easy way to put it were there  abortions when the  constitution was being  drafted was abortion a big  issue on the table Rick during  constitution I mean maybe  they gave them at some point  but was that really a hotbed  issue in 1700 a belt to the  bread basket I don't believe  abortion was talked a lot about 
[03:04:30]  no no no I don't think they  were um talking about abortion  Carlin's bit is genius he  says how come we don't count  them in the census if they're  people yeah how about that  okay I'm sorry I didn't mean to  interrupt there go back just a  team it's him again another 10  seconds I'll catch you  I think that that's what the  constitution clearly intended to  protect um but do you do you  really do you really let me ask  you this do you really believe in  every case it should be totally 
[03:05:00]  wrong in the sense that I know  that you believe even in cases  of rape and incest but you've  got two daughters through you  know if you had a daughter that  came loves daughter rape yes and  was pregnant and was begging you  to let her have an abortion would  you really better look her in the  eye and say no as her father I  would I would do what every  father would do is to try to  counsel your daughter to do the  right thing it's sort of you know  and it's it's almost impossibly  it's a hypothetical thing to ask 
[03:05:30]  you but there will be people in  that position yeah and they will  share your religious values it's  not a matter of religious value and  they're looking at their daughter  saying let him finish how can I deal  with this because if I make you  know you presented your question  let him finish ruin her life well you  can make the argument that if she  doesn't have this baby if she if she  kills her child that that too could  ruin her life this is not an easy  choice I understand and you'll never  have to make it horrible as the way  that that solder daughter and son was 
[03:06:00]  created it still is her child and  whether she has that child or she  doesn't it will always be her child  and she will always know that and and  so to to embrace her rapist child  supporter and get her through this  very difficult time I've always you  know I believe and I think you know  the right approach is to is to accept  this horribly created in the sense of  of rape but nevertheless gift and in a 
[03:06:30]  in a in a in a very broken way the  gift of human life and accept what God  is giving to you as as as you know  gift in a shitty fucking package  different aspects of our life we have  horrible things happen to I can't think  of anything more horrible but  nevertheless we have to make the best  out of a bad situation how do you  how do you equate that is making the  how do you equate because I know that  your position I think and correct me if  I'm wrong is that you but just  believe in the sanctity the innocence  of life how do you equate that with  supporting the death penalty given  there are so many people who actually 
[03:07:00]  are completely innocent yeah I've  supported mandatory DNA testing and we  have to be certain I mean if there's we  can't be well you can if you can't be  certain as a commander-in-chief again as  the president if you can't be certain and  in fact you know for a fact many  innocent people are getting killed under  this system and you believe  can you pause Sam one second because  Pierce is wrong here too and I agree  with Pierce on the fact that if you  can't be certain all the time but  mandatory DNA testing is important if 
[03:07:30]  somebody woman is raped and murdered and  there's mandatory DNA testing and your  DNA is found in her or whatever there is  a certain way we can be certain yeah  yeah but the thing is I'm thinking  like fuck it if you're certain or not he  shouldn't be for the death penalty right  he shouldn't be for the death penalty  the guy fucking they found him over the  body with the bloody knives in it in  both hands if he feels that abortion is  murder then he should feel that the  taking of any life even in a military 
[03:08:00]  action how about that you send troops  overseas to kill people you're still  killing people what we know best as to  when and what context of killing people is  stuff stuff that the Lord would agree  with do you honestly think you're that  fucking wise you gotta let people live no  matter what yeah either let them live no  matter what or kill everybody who gets a  shit now and the obvious question it's  uh Santorum gets the nod yeah what do you 
[03:08:30]  do vote for him he's white oh I vote for  him because I feel that these um that these  topics that they they they drag out of  people during the elections are less than  one percent of what the fuck is going to  be needed from this guy what's going to be  done don't worry Santorum gets in don't  worry your abortions are safe your  abortions are safe I do get pissed about 
[03:09:00]  the stem cell research I I'd like to you  know lop off some fucking uh fetus uh heads  and uh get a bunch of get all the stem  cells we need out of them like a pez  dispenser just open that neck up and  have stem cells flying out of their  little faces and squeeze it out like uh  yeah old toothpaste yeah like old  toothpaste did as much as you can out of  that little so that uh that's a problem  but you know I I just I cannot vote for  Obama sorry again I'd vote for anyone in 
[03:09:30]  there except for there you go with  Santorum what a douche but I mean like  what a hateable I fucking hate the guy  fucking not to be approached a pro-life  because if you're pro-life you're pro-life  but when they when they take it into  like rape and incest that is such crazy  a fucking absolute disregard for a  woman's ability to do what she wants to  do with her own body like even beyond  you made an irresponsible choice you can't  punish you why don't we force that on  somebody why don't we ever deal with  logic religion and logic uh they just 
[03:10:00]  don't share the same yeah no I  understand that trust me but yeah  shouldn't there be some exceptions to  every rule these hard-line fucking  religious people there's no bending  with them you know today uh I have to  say made me appreciate my parents a  little more whoa because I can't I can't  imagine having a fucking guy like this  as a father who thinks this way or  Kirk Cameron I'd rather have my father  blessing the wall with spaghetti and  meatballs than uh have to grow up with  this motherfucker I am my mom  obviously had mental issues but she 
[03:10:30]  never thought like this shit she was  always fucking open-minded holy fuck  that there's people like this that you  you there there are people we're  talking to right now that have parents  like this a father like this you know  what's fucked up a lot of times parents  like this raise uh children that do the  opposite you know um I've known  religious families growing up that  were hard fucking line Catholic yeah and  the daughters wow wow did they love  that uh what I call fucking yeah yeah 
[03:11:00]  they just wanted to get out of that  house where the mother is fucking  preaching and the father's fucking  preaching and everybody's uh uh checking  everything that these girls did for  purity meanwhile you know we'd go out on  the weekends down some booze and fuck  got to that fucking do some of that  fucking here's the last bit of um the  Kirk Cameron clip from Piers Morgan I 
[03:11:30]  think he was in the middle of talking  about abortion as well here do you yes  of course I find that amazing people  would say that oh but because I love I  love my daughter I love that little  child this is a little preacher made in  God's image perhaps you know imagine if  that if you if you were the result of  that and you had been aborted we  wouldn't be here having this  conversation psychopath I love that  fucking logic he peers would know that  he was aborted uh and that would be  that you're talking about shit before  you ever really a person break it down 
[03:12:00]  I mean all right down so the kid if the  kid's born do you get to a place in your  life where you accept the kid and love  the kid I guess I guess you have to be  you have to be one of those loony  religious people in order to accept the  kid of a rapist but most people  wouldn't be able to take the first  step which is to force their daughter  to have the kid yeah but if the kid is  born do you get to a place in your own  head like look you know I don't know I 
[03:12:30]  think you got to be loony religious  person to accept it fully really accept  it yeah or you're just gonna be  looking at it the whole time going  rapist gets older and starts really  looking low you look like your father  yeah you're fucking why would you why  would a why would a woman want to be  reminded of that constantly reminded  constantly of not only the rape but the  rapist that's him and I wonder what if  we would say if you know you did make a 
[03:13:00]  good point there by the way about um  how it's a lot of this shit is nonsense  because it has nothing to do with running  the country none because nothing really  they're not gonna change policy we know  more about a lot of this stuff we know  more about Santorum's loony fucking  abortion stance than we do about a  Santorum uh how about bringing fuel  fuel prices down how about jobs how  about dealing with China and the debt and  you know uh our military strength and  Iran and Israel there's so many things 
[03:13:30]  that are right here right now that that  the president does deal with and then  there's abortion the most you could turn  it into is a character issue you could  say all right because he's like this I  kind of have a line on what he's about  that could affect other things that he  does have a say over but to just sit  there and go well he's for uh he doesn't  like abortion well then fuck him it's  like what that's you know I don't like  uh the best brain surgeon in the world  because he's I don't like it the shoes 
[03:14:00]  he's wearing it doesn't affect uh what  he's wearing clown shoes you know well he  could be funny guy surgeon but he's  really talented this guy wants to know  god I think we made ourselves pretty  obvious here today but Ron in Illinois go  ahead hey good morning welcome aboard  Ronnie I'm a father of three daughters  and there's no way in hell I would uh I  would have her have an abortion what I'm  trying to figure out is I'm sitting here  as a dad wait wait wait wait wait I got 
[03:14:30]  to stop you that's fine to think that way  but even if she's raped yes okay wow  I'm sitting here I've got to deal with  the tragedy that my daughter was just  violated and now on top of that I'm  gonna have her kill a baby this is what  I'm gonna add to her already horrific  situation it's what you know no no no no  no you're not what if she wants yeah  thank you does she have a choice in this  at all sir as as a father I would do 
[03:15:00]  everything to try to push her in a  particular way but ultimately it comes  down to her decision would I agree with  it no okay well that's fair enough to say  that you don't agree with it you don't  think the turmoil of having a baby of a  rapist would be more detrimental then  but then I would follow up with the  question what did the baby do why is the  baby going to be punished why is the  baby going to be killed what did the  baby do so basically you're saying that 
[03:15:30]  the rapist has the right in God's eyes  no hold on hold on fuck God well no no  okay rapist has the right to put this to  take this woman and make her have his  baby so no no according to your logic if  the baby doing nothing wrong takes  priority over the woman saying I don't  want to have a baby any rapist has the  right to force that on a woman I think 
[03:16:00]  you're you're you're leaving a step out  though from my particular point of view  once that sperm is hit that egg that  individual becomes that individual so  it's no longer the rapist or the  mother's choice no but I didn't I  didn't just like you or I do no I but  I didn't I didn't skip the step I'm  saying you said the right of that egg  with come on it to be born is more  important than the woman's right to say  I don't want this in my body so the 
[03:16:30]  rapist by raping her can let's just say  there's any woman I like who I want to  have my kid um no and that she doesn't  want to so according to your law or your  belief if I just decide to put a gun in  her mouth and rape her she now the right  thing for her to do is have that baby so  I have infringed upon her body and now  she's gonna have the baby that I wanted  her to have yes because I believe once  the baby is made that baby has its  individual rights needs to be protected 
[03:17:00]  okay but what about you what about the  woman's right to make the decision on  what if the woman has been responsible  and makes her decision and lives  according to God's rules and that does  not have premarital sex and is saving  herself for someone special just like God  requests and religion requests and then  she's raped and that choice is removed by a  rapist you still think that the life of  that unborn kid who has not formed yet  takes priority over her right to live by  her decision yes I believe okay becomes a 
[03:17:30]  quote-unquote host and she is carrying  another living human being in her body  that that baby cool because where do you  draw the line where do you draw the line  the same place the Supreme Court has drawn  the line sir the Supreme Court says that  it's not a living thing at conception I  don't believe it is either I don't  believe it is either thank you and and as a  father who's seen sonograms and has been 
[03:18:00]  through three birds I can absolutely tell  you that's idiotic well that's your that's  your opinion I think what's I think what's  idiotic is that you'd sell your daughter  out and by but I mean by that you guys  can't grasp and don't want to acknowledge  that that is another living human being  now listen I'm listening it's a living  collection of cells my friend whether it's  a human  wait no no now you're you're making the 
[03:18:30]  step of faith and saying that that is a  human being at that point I'm saying  it's a living organism that is not yet a  living human being with a soul and a  personality and a purpose in life and and  up until the point it has that to me  personally to me I don't consider that  murdering anything I consider it the same 
[03:19:00]  as as taking a tumor out of somebody  understood so what you're saying then is  until that baby is born and breaks on its  own it would fall under the definition  that you just gave no no no no I don't  think so wrong wrong no no wrong wrong  wrong wrong don't misquote people I know  you're adding in things it's a very  tricky there is a certain time period  they put I am not for late-term abortions  I'm the why Jimmy what's the difference  because you're not going to catch me in 
[03:19:30]  an inconsistency I'm telling you why I  think the way I think okay I think when  it's a bunch of cells and it has not  formed into anything yet I don't think  I don't consider that a human being  once it begins to take all my can I get  a religious nut can I finish or do you  want to just keep babbling like you  probably do at your family because I'm  answering I'm telling you why I feel the  way I feel I'm listening to you and you 
[03:20:00]  just continually interrupt I apologize  the reason I think that there is the  only way we can define it or the way I  define it is after a certain period of  time I don't know if it's three months or  whatever it is well first term that I  could be honest with you it you find out  that it develops quickly into something  whatever whatever three months no way I  just don't feel weeks Jimmy that  immediately upon conception life begins  and even if I did feel that way I would  think that the woman's right to make a 
[03:20:30]  decision like that is hers to make and  not mine and yours because especially to  force it on her with a rape like the  audacity the nerve of anybody to tell  someone they have to carry a rapist's  cum in them and give birth to it like the  audacity of you always makes it sexy and  by the way if you if you feel that way if  that life is more important than if you  had a pistol and you were watching say  one of your daughters or say not even a 
[03:21:00]  woman you didn't know being raped to  remove it a little bit would you shoot  the perpetrator or is his life so  precious that it overrides that woman's  right good question sir that's where my  hypocrisy as a human being steps in and I  blow his fucking head off but why it's a  living thing I think once and call it  crazy but once we've been on this planet  for a lack of better words and we've  made right or wrong decisions and  choices we as a collective group have a 
[03:21:30]  right to pass judgment because of your  actions right you're trying to compare  that to the innocence of someone who  doesn't have a choice who didn't make  any decision and just happens to be  here under some relief yeah but I put  but I put that I mean I apologize for  interrupting you I do use that  description except I put it on the  woman not the baby the innocence not  maybe innocence is an adult woman but  the person who didn't have the choice  and who didn't do anything wrong you're  giving that quality to the baby and 
[03:22:00]  that's very admirable I am giving it to  the woman who was raped unless she was  dressed in such shorts absolutely if she  had on pumps 100% with then you know  but I'm putting that and again not like  childlike innocence but I'm saying that  if she is innocent and she has behaved I'm  put I'm personally I'm for I'm pro-choice  anyway I don't necessarily like abortion  but I am for the woman's right to do it  but I'm giving that quality to the  woman her ability to live a good life  and to not be forced to carry the baby  of a rapist I just don't I think it's 
[03:22:30]  despicable that we would make a woman do  that and what about the other side of it  the babies that aren't born because now  this woman maybe will never get pregnant  again or chooses not right sir I'm  sorry was that a question to me yeah I  mean why not well think about it let's  say she aborts the baby but now you know  she would she would get pregnant again  eventually and that would be her actual  child but that actual child would never  have a chance because she was raped and  decided maybe never to you know give 
[03:23:00]  birth again you know I'm trying to say  I do and we could create all types of  slippery slope situations to where we  play the what if game for me  personally it just comes down to  whether or not it is a human being  and whether or not it's alive how it  got to that point is it regardless are  we killing a living being or not can we  kill it at five weeks can we kill it at  12 weeks can we kill it at 28 weeks  everyone's got the line that they drawn  in the sand so for jimmy let's say it's 
[03:23:30]  up to the first two months or three  months and for you it's for the six  months that was the whole intent of my  question was where do we draw the line  when do we say it is a human being and  it's not before it can hold a rattle yeah  I honestly anytime before it grips a  rattle it's a tough it's a tough  question it's a tough question it's a  tough question it's like six months in  and maybe three weeks is is maybe I'm  sorry maybe three months is too far along  like I think sometimes pro-abortionists  go way too far and they want a kid at 
[03:24:00]  seven months to be able to be yanked out  with his arm ripped off and I'm again I  don't agree with that I think there's a  line and I would trust science to define  it a lot more than anybody relying on  what they think is the word of God the  hardest point with that though is science  and religion no one on this fucking  planet has been able to define when that  divine spark of life enters the the the  body is it at conception I don't know 
[03:24:30]  shit well I don't think so I think when  that first cell divides into two and then  into four and then eight I don't see  person in that sorry when it starts  forming maybe the universe does maybe  the universe does you're right maybe it  does and and and then you could say well  given the opportunity for that to  gestate and and come out it will at some  point be a real person with a  personality that the ability to go on and 
[03:25:00]  have other kids but does that mean that  right from the start it's that person  no I don't think it does when does the  heart start beating I don't think the  heart beating means anything either but  I'm just wondering that would be that  would be closer to what we understand is  life is the brain form it's forming  throughout the yeah like everything has  its place I don't completely disagree with  the guy because when I saw the sonogram of  my son for the first time like holy shit  there's some stuff already developed this 
[03:25:30]  this early on I was blown away I didn't  realize there the 4d technology that  they have today it's insane loves babies  shut up with your baby yeah oh tell me  more I'm not gonna argue your abortion  stance like I you know you have the  right to feel that way and be pro-life  and anti-abortion that's fine I mean you  whatever I just find anybody who would  expect a woman to have a baby she was  raped into having I think that's just  such a reprehensible point of view well to  get involved I think the woman should  absolutely have the right to do 
[03:26:00]  whatever she wants it especially in that  case I think in all cases but especially  that case you should leave her alone  rape makes time fly I didn't even know  it was 10 o'clock already I'm like  fucking rape man hey Ron thank you  brother  what do you mean  your call was aborted that's it we  fucking yanked you  wow wow wow wow we got a little insight 
[03:26:30]  between Kirk Cameron Rick Santorum and  that guy you know what surprised me  insight you know what surprised me the  most huh we weren't able to change his  mind on abortion no shit it's just uh you  know usually when I talk to people that  are a staunch anti-abortion of people I  could change their opinion in no time yeah  and I've gone back and forth in my  opinion it's just one of those things  that you know one really gets that  attached to that's I disagree with  just oh it's just a waste of time 
[03:27:00]  because you're not going to change  anyone's mind they think yeah I think  on something like that right yes his  logic was look if he sees his daughter  being raped he's gonna do everything he  can to kill you know to make sure it  doesn't happen but when that sperm hits  the egg in his world it's too late  he sees he sees those balls tightening  up ready to shoot a load he's like  no he's jumping in with his open mouth  trying to get the seed before it goes  in his daughter's vag no he would  prevent it from happening but as soon as 
[03:27:30]  it once it hits oh it's over that's where  he really believes oh man his daughter  should have the kid yeah that's how he  thinks but you know that's that's what  it is people don't know when life  actually starts you're never going to  get a real answer from it because it's  a spiritual kind of a thing but I  think I think as far as the universe  goes as soon as soon as that as soon as  the egg and the sperm hook up game on  I don't know you look at those cells  breaking up and it's like I cares what  that is I understand but I think over  universally that's that's life how about 
[03:28:00]  a tumor like I said before a tumor a  tumor is nothing but but abnormal cells  dividing multiplying making a mass and  and why that's a life in you why isn't  that's some kind of precious fucking  thing wow good question it's just it's  it's just it's stupid it's but it's it's  a life it's some form of it's some form  of life why are you killing that life  yeah you don't know if maybe you know  somewhere else it's very complicated  bunch of tumors are walking around  coming down the hall what do you want  speaking of tumors geez speaking of a 
[03:28:30]  cancer somebody somebody wrote something  funny what if Jim Norton was raped and  got pregnant should he keep it we need him  to keep his lumpy figure my awful body  is common knowledge figure that is not  the tumor wow look at the phone so man  you talk about abortion wow and it's  like not even in it's not even abortion  I'm like you I'm I I'm for it but I get  why people are against it he's put to be a 
[03:29:00]  rape victim worst case scenario mighty yeah  fuck do you tell a woman that she has to  do that worst case scenario some fucking  animal puts his cum in her and she has  to walk around and look at her stomach  yeah maybe she feels like okay I'm  gonna have this kid I feel like I should  that's her decision yeah that's her  decision maybe fucked her better than her  husband she's pleased with it but to  other people around you giving that  person the guilt that they have to have  the kid I'll never understand that no  fucking way I think we I think we did  good with the ladies today ladies love us 
[03:29:30]  today oh please they gotta love us yeah  the guy did just say irregardless to  someone on Twitter's pointing that out he  did say irregardless regardless of the  situations right irregardless thinks that  way what are you gonna do it's the world  we live in yeah yeah that guy didn't sound  like and that guy didn't sound like a  dummy he didn't sound like a dummy to me  that's how he thinks Santorum thinks this  way and he's that close to being the  fucking president not a dumb guy he's not  gonna be a president by the way not a 
[03:30:00]  chance in hell but how close he got yeah  irreg's dumb you just had to add that in  oh irreg sam is a home what's that am  it's 10 oh five just go home but we do an  extra radio eric like the way eric thinks we  don't mail it in like you yeah I can't  argue with irreg on this one I know I'm  kind of on irreg's side on this 10 o'clock  he kind of got us on that one go home by  the way you want to talk about the rape  quandary just gave us a quandary right  there we know we know we want to beat  him up for the next half hour but but not 
[03:30:30]  on extra time no maude is now running  through my head no no no we're not gonna do that  maude joan of arc had the lord to guide her  and then there's maude it's been why are you  doing this we could have went home oh no we  had it now  was a freedom rider she didn't care in the  whole world  dun dun dun  joan of arc with the lord to guide her she  was a sister who really cooked  isadora was the first bra by the angel that 
[03:31:00]  she showed up  the country was falling apart  got it also oh yeah  and then there's maude  and then there's maude  and then there's maude  compromising enterprise and anything but  tranquilizing right on maude  right on maude 
[03:31:30]  so isn't this right  every fucking time  This has just been stuck in my fucking head.  Dude, it's ruining my life. 
[03:32:00]  Somebody says a fortune music.  Imagine this playing.  Her feet are up in those stainless steel stirrups.  Fucking horrid instruments going into her.  Don't worry, I think we're...  And the abortionist is smiling like Norman Fell.  Yeah, it's got a plunger.  It's just sucking the kid out.  I have one announcement.

And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:33:30]  Man, oh man.  Sal, where on earth?  Where in the blue hell, Sal, do you think you're going?  You should have seen.  Iraq, did you see how quick Sal went for that door?  He ran.  I saw it.  Where in the shit, Sal, do you think you're going?  Sal, can you give me a coffee at Duck and Donuts?  Listen.  Don't give me the fingers, buddy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Of all days, here on the Opie and Anthony Show, my name is Sam Roberts. 
[03:34:00]  I couldn't have been more happy today that all intern responsibilities have been completely  taken away from me.  You're laughing.  I love it.  You, Eric, were at the center of this.  Travis was there.  Why, first of all, why were the intern responsibilities taken away from me?  I don't understand that.  I never did.  Um, well, it was, uh, did it have to do with the people I was hiring?  Um, the tards?  No, that, that became secondary. 
[03:34:30]  But, uh, just, uh, associations with other things.  They just decided to, uh, wipe the slate clean and they said, well, he's the only one that  hasn't had anything to do with him.  So, Iraq is in charge.  Or the last intern you hired, all he says is, I like blue.  Yeah, that probably had something to do with it.  My, I wouldn't have picked, like, Sal wouldn't have been one of my picks.  You understand that.  Eric probably would have.  Oh, come on.  Eric, yeah.  You would have, Eric, you're closer along with, uh, one of my picks.  Tarditos.  Um, so, first of all, E-Rock. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  I think, well, this makes it very clear.  Because a couple of weeks ago, it was more than a couple of weeks ago, it was probably  like three weeks ago, Club Story Kenny called into the after show.  And I remember this.  Oh, yeah.  He said, at least he's not a fucking cheese eater.  About whoever I was talking about.  I don't remember who I was talking about.  But he said, at least he's not a fucking cheese eater.  And that came out of nowhere.  And I was like, what?  And I said, I'm assuming at some point, we'll figure out what you meant by that.  Obviously, this had to have all been going down on that day. 
[03:35:30]  Um, when he said, obviously, cheese eater refers to rat.  And, uh, the controversy came up on the show today that, uh, Kenny had been asking Sal to  run all the talent's food errands because Sal is the most responsible one.  And, uh, Sal took umbrage with it because, number one, he was watching other interns just  sit around and not do food orders.  And number, and this was no fault of their own.  It's who was being asked.  And number two, he was also, had graduated, we'll say, to the point where he was doing 
[03:36:00]  a lot of production work, a lot of other show work that he said wasn't getting done  because he was on food orders all the time.  Yeah, that's food runs.  He earned the responsibility.  That's right, Roland.  Um, yeah, yeah, you got one.  So, what happened was, uh, Sal, first tell me, that day, weeks ago, I guess it must have  been three weeks ago, because that's the time frame that everybody's been talking about  here, when Kenny said, uh, at least he's not a cheese eater. 
[03:36:30]  Did you know what he was referring to?  Yeah, I asked you, I asked you after we left the after show and I said, did you pick up  on what Kenny said?  He said, yeah, he was referring to you.  Yeah.  Well, um, he thought that you had gone to management over all this.  Of course, of course he would.  Because he's going to naturally be hostile towards me, to begin with.  Kenny's naturally hostile towards you?  No, no, no.  He's, if he, if he saw that I had a problem with him, of course he's naturally going to 
[03:37:00]  think that I was going to go to someone who's way, way above me and bring up such a minor  bullshit issue.  Were you getting annoyed though, feeling like you were like the premium intern and seeing  like the other interns not, like, like, were you being asked to do more work simply because  you were better at it?  Well, yeah, I think that's, that's almost the sign of your internship is going well is  that, you know, you do, you do good work.  We're going to give you more work now.  You, the only reward is more work in the end. 
[03:37:30]  But then you realize you're stuck doing menial things that the other interns haven't even  gotten a chance to do.  No, like, like I said earlier, ONA, if, and Jimmy, if anybody, a guest comes in, if they  want something, they should absolutely fucking get it ASAP.  And it should be, and it should be correct.  With the guests, if I need coffee for guests, how it runs and does it.  Hang on, hotline call.  You're on after opening Anthony live.  Yeah, what do you think it is?  Club soda.  Yeah, let's set the record straight, all right?  And let's be perfectly clear about this.  I didn't think anything. 
[03:38:00]  Okay.  I don't assume, I get my facts before I act.  I was told who was the fucking rat, all right?  So let that person admit that they fucking lied.  So, Eric, you told Kenny that Sal went to management over this, right?  I told, yes.  And I said, Kenny, I told Kenny that Sal was the one who was complaining about all of this.  Did you lie when you said he went to management or were you misinformed?  No, because at that time in the morning, I didn't know.  Because when I got spoken to, Sal had gone from me, had gone to Travis. 
[03:38:30]  And then when management came and talked to me, then I was like, well, you know, Sal complained.  I told Kenny straight out that this is what was going on.  Well, the problem was it was an assumption.  At that point.  Right.  Because I got spoken to.  So, Kenny, you were just going based on the information that you were given.  Why would I have any reason not to believe him?  I asked him a direct question.  He gave me an answer.  So, either he lied now or he's fucking backtracking to cover his ass. 
[03:39:00]  No, it's not either one or the other.  It was, that's what I was, that's what I believed at the time.  When you asked me about this, I told you straight out.  Nobody was lying to you.  It seems like a reasonable assumption.  You there, Kenny?  Oh, yeah, I'm here.  Oh, okay.  I'm just relishing the fact that look what happens when you assume.  I get my facts before I act. 
[03:39:30]  I asked you, you answered me, and then I proceeded.  That was, I will say, Eric, on this one, that was an assumption, correct?  At that point, yes.  Yes.  And now you know that, when did you find out that Travis had gone to Gary because he was trying to figure out how to get to the bottom of this and not Sal?  This was later on, but at that point, this was the guidelines that were put in place.  So, you know what?  That's what we had to work with.  So, Kenny had to come talk to me. 
[03:40:00]  I was told that, and then I delegated it to the interns.  I understand.  When did you find out that Sal did not go talk to management?  I, you know, sometime after that day's show.  Maybe within the next day or two, somewhere around there.  It wasn't that long.  But at that point, it didn't dawn on me that this was a huge fucking problem.  Like, it wasn't new information to it.  Yeah?  Sam?  Yeah.  Sam?  Yeah.  Sorry to interrupt, but could we maybe discuss this after Kenny drops me off? 
[03:40:30]  Is it making, thank you, LB?  I appreciate it.  Well, he, first of all, he almost rear-ended a cab because he was looking for his phone when you guys started discussing this.  He, I swear to you, I've never seen anyone swerp like he did to avoid accident.  And then he almost ran over a horse, so could we maybe give me, I don't know, I'll be home in seven minutes, and then he can bring us back up, and then Kenny could call in again.  Because I'm a little scared. 
[03:41:00]  I liked your observation today when he was going back and forth with Eric, with E-Rock, and you said, E-Rock, you're not going to win this.  Kenny is a detective.  Oh, I'm glad someone picked up on that.  He will get the answers.  Of course.  Kenny always gets to the bottom of things.  That's why we love him.  Does Kenny relish in this type of atmosphere because he can use the detective skills again?  I guess, but not on the way home today.  You got him very excited.  He didn't know where his phone was, and he's like, you know what? 
[03:41:30]  Screw driving.  I need to find my phone.  Well, I have to believe that Kenny, this does excite Kenny because he doesn't get to break out those old interrogation room skills very often.  Sam, what excites me is I don't want to be misrepresented.  We all get that.  Kenny feels like he was being misrepresented, so obviously he had to call in.  Believe me, because I can do a lot of things to get myself in trouble.  It's not.  You sure?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just yellow.  All right.  I can do a lot of things to get myself in trouble on my own. 
[03:42:00]  I don't need anybody's help.  When this stuff comes up, do you enjoy the process of arguing your case, though, because you get to be the detective again?  No, I'm a has-been, and I take no pleasure in, you know, pointing out people's faults to themselves.  You don't?  You don't take a little bit of pleasure in that?  Sam?  Yeah?  You can't multitask. 
[03:42:30]  You can't drive and argue at the same time.  When are you going to understand what I'm trying to say here today?  Opie, was that a yellow light, or was that a red light?  It was, I would go red.  It was close enough to red that you would have stopped?  Yes.  And I go through stuff all the time.  Well, I mean, I want to talk about this, but your safety is paramount to me.  No, you can continue.  It was more of a joke, I guess.  Thank God.  But the horse thing wasn't a joke, and the rear ending of the cab was absolutely not a joke.  You know, I love to drive distracted. 
[03:43:00]  How close did you come to running over a horse?  Pretty close.  I think we almost nipped its little ankle.  What's more dangerous, driving with Kenny...  Do horses have ankles?  Huh?  Ankles.  Do horses have ankles?  I don't know.  Because I think we almost took out an ankle.  Go ahead, Sam.  What's more dangerous, driving with Kenny when he's on the phone and in an excited state,  or driving with Kenny when he's dozing off?  I've had bulk experience. 
[03:43:30]  The dozing office.  It's quite scary.  It is.  Nothing better than doing the exact same route to work for the last, what, seven years,  and him missing a turn because he's a bit sleepy or asleep.  Yeah.  That has happened a few times.  Or I have to go, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, left, left.  Or asleep?  He almost ran over an old guy in his health.  In his walker.  In his walker.  That was close, too.  Well, he's agitated.  I do very well under pressure. 
[03:44:00]  Are you ag...  Does this agitate you, this thing that's going on here, Kenny?  Well, yeah.  When you said, like, Kenny thought, I wanted to set the record straight.  Because Kenny doesn't think.  Nobody cares what Kenny thinks.  We all know Kenny doesn't think.  Most of us felt like you didn't have the ability to think.  That's what we're saying.  Yeah.  You're just a thought processor.  I mean, a fact processor.  We like to call him a cyborg.  Yes.  You just...  Information is input, and then output is whatever the result of the information is. 
[03:44:30]  Exactly.  Right.  All right.  Well, we'll watch our tongues, then.  I'll explain that to you later, Kenny.  Well, have a safe trip home.  Well, I'm home now.  Yeah, he's just pulling up.  That whole ride is over now, thank God.  Thank God.  I'm really...  I'm thankful not only for Obie, but for the lives of all those horses.  The horse was a little close.  I don't know.  But these idiot horses, we see it all the time. 
[03:45:00]  All of a sudden, they decide they need to make a complete U-turn in traffic.  And the guy who's trying to drive the horse and buggy is trying to get the horse back on track?  No!  No!  No, it has nothing to do with the horse.  The guy just takes off in traffic.  I've seen it a million times.  I'm surprised more horses aren't hit by cars than this.  Yeah, they don't obey traffic rules.  All of a sudden, he goes, I gotta make a U-turn.  And just starts its U-turn, assuming everybody else is gonna stop and get out of its way.  Oh.  All right, well...  You were terrific on the show today, man. 
[03:45:30]  Have a good day.  Yeah, I will.  Bye, G.H.  Bye, Kenny.  Hey, Kenny.  How's traffic, by the way?  It's a little congested where I am now.  What about other roads around the area?  I don't know.  It looks like sunny and dry and clear.  So hopefully, I'll have a smooth ride home.  Well, that's great.  I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.  Should I let you go?  Or do you want to just be on hold?  Or do you want to just be on the phone? 
[03:46:00]  No, I'll listen.  But the minute you say something wrong, I'm calling back.  Okay, that's fair.  We'll be watching.  If anybody calls, you know, says something out of line...  Okay.  I don't want to be misrepresented.  I wouldn't want to misrepresent you.  I wouldn't want to have you misrepresented on this show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What else could you talk about, though?  Well, I mean, we talk a little bit about Evan, who was in here on Friday, the old intern.  He told me some...  Evan Seaman? 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, he told me some funny stuff about what he's doing now.  We could talk about Twitter and people being blocked.  We could talk about the little camera attachment that Anthony got on his iPhone today.  There's a bunch of stuff.  I have the Harry T thing where he got young effort and doing instant feedback.  Talk about Harry T.  There's a whole bunch of stuff to talk about today.  Do you want to talk about the antisocial comedy show at Foxwoods?  Talk to me.  It's going on sale Friday.  Really?  Who's going to be on the lineup? 
[03:47:00]  Oh, it's a new lineup now.  Who is it?  Do you remember?  Of course.  Good.  Are you saying I'm stupid?  I'm not going to answer that.  All right.  Who's the lineup?  Well, it's hosted by Jim Norton.  Mm-hmm.  And it features David Tell, Marty Lang, and the newcomer Nick DiPaolo.  That's going to be a great show.  It sure is.  These antisocial networks...  Foxwoods is a great place. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, well, I can't...  When is that happening?  In June 9th.  And tickets go on sale Friday?  Yes.  Be on the lookout for that.  Start saving your money now, ladies and gentlemen.  Start saving your pennies now.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Kenny, I'm going to get back to this, but feel free to call in if you feel misrepresented.  All right, Sam.  Thanks.  Keep up the good work.  Thank you very much, Kenny.  Goodbye.  Hey, how's your Sunday afternoon show going?  It's gangbusters right now.  No, I mean, last week we had Curt Schilling and Dr. Ruth on.  I mean, yesterday. 
[03:48:00]  Curt Schilling and Dr. Ruth were on.  I don't know what's going on this week.  We'll probably have an interview or two and some topics.  It's a great show.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm sorry I missed it the last couple Sundays.  Well, we lacked having you call in, but hopefully you'll be back at it again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny.  How's your Hit 20 show going?  It's going.  I mean, if you're into that type of thing, it's just me talking for five to eight seconds 
[03:48:30]  between songs about nonsense.  Yeah.  How's your podcast going?  The podcast is going very well.  Very well.  It's on iTunes.  That's good.  And how's Troy today?  Troy's really good.  Troy, I talked to him a little bit.  Actually, while your segment was on today, while you were arguing, while you and Sal and  E-Rock and Travis and everybody were in here arguing and trying to figure out what was going  on, I ran out of the studio and ducked into Troy's studio to say, isn't this the greatest 
[03:49:00]  thing ever?  And Troy said, yes, it's awesome.  Yeah.  Troy's awesome.  Did he make any new mixtapes lately?  I don't know, but you can check it out on Troy Kwan on Twitter.  Thank you, Kenny.  I'm going to get back to this now.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  How's Roland doing?  Roland's fine.  He was in here a minute ago.  We pitched a guest that I think we got approval on.  It looks like Edge from WWE will be in here tomorrow.  It's very exciting.  Is he following his diet?  You'd have to ask Roland, you know. 
[03:49:30]  Oh, you don't know?  No, I don't know that answer.  Oh, what's your problem with Roland all of a sudden?  I don't have any problem with Roland.  I think he's a great guy.  Me and him get along very well.  All right, if you say so.  All right, Kenny.  Goodbye.  Wait.  Do you want some more questions?  Nope.  See, talk to you later.  Bye.  Bye.  Sometimes you just have to cut him off, Sal.  At any point during today's whole fiasco, did you think to yourself, why didn't I just 
[03:50:00]  keep getting the food orders?  I said I just kept getting breakfast.  As soon as it started, I thought that.  Where's the other intern?  Get that other intern back in here.  Eric.  He's coming in.  He's answering your phones.  Like he's somebody special.  Yeah.  He should know he's shit under your feet.  Right, Sal?  Go get you.  Fuck him.  You go get the fucking food.  I've got real work to do.  That's what you say to these interns, right?  Can I sit down?  Is that all right?  Sit down.  Have yourself a seat.  Make yourself comfortable.  Eric, this whole time, we didn't get the voice of the other intern, because this whole 
[03:50:30]  thing was based on...  If you didn't hear the argument, definitely.  It was like the second segment of the show.  The replay starts at 3 p.m. as always, but definitely check it out today, because it  was...  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, awesome.  I thought it was horrible.  Well, that's because you were at the center of it.  Of course you did.  You know why you thought it was horrible?  Because the rest of the audience doesn't feel the stress and the, oh my god, what did  I do?  I made the wrong move.  Like, Kenny is the worst person on the show to get into an argument.  He's calling out, probably.  He's the worst person on the show to get into an argument with, because he did this professionally. 
[03:51:00]  First of all, he's a giant.  And second of all, he doesn't even have to use his physical stature to win this thing,  because he was a detective.  He interrogated people for a living.  I'm assuming this is you, Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah, you better put me on hold, because I'm going to go in the Lincoln Tunnel, and  I'm going to lose the signal.  And I want to hear, God forbid, that other kid opens his mouth about me. 
[03:51:30]  Okay, I'm going to put you on hold.  All right, thanks.  Okay.  All right, Club Soda Kenny is on hold.  Kenny's always listening, but feel free to speak openly and honestly with me, Eric.  Eric, first of all, E-Rock, did you hire this intern simply because you wanted somebody  else with the name Eric?  No, not at all.  Is that true?  I'm 100% positive.  Okay, I just wanted to make sure, because people like their own names, and you have a  bit of an ego.  Yeah, no.  Okay.  Spelled differently, though.  How is your name spelled?  I got a C, he's got a K.  You bet he does.  That's right.  So, Sal is in here, right, and he's saying, I've been doing this for a while. 
[03:52:00]  Yes.  All right?  I'm doing production.  Mm-hmm.  I'm doing all kinds of shit for the show that's a little bit above food orders.  Of course.  Why aren't some of these other, as he put it, jamokes, I believe.  Was that the word you used, Sal?  Yeah, it was something along those lines.  Jamokes.  Why don't one of these jamokes, these newbie interns, why don't one of them go down and  get a fucking, what he said, fucking food order for a change for once in their meaningless 
[03:52:30]  lives?  And then, God damn it, I think I was like, God damn it.  Well, God damn it, I established the first day here that I'm willing to do anything and  everything that is asked of me.  Until it gets asked a bit too much, and then you Sal out a little bit.  Yeah.  No, no.  How did it make you feel, as one of the other interns, to know that Sal was looked at as  superior to you and the other guy?  Well, as a listener of the show, I had heard Sal on air the previous semester. 
[03:53:00]  He must have been a really close listener, he wasn't on the air that much.  No, but I've heard the fighting amongst the other interns, so yeah, I knew of Sal when  I came here, he basically showed me the way and how to do things, because when the show's  going on, Eric's busy running the show, so anything going on behind the scenes, Sal's  helping me out with and showing me what to do, because obviously he's a production guy  and he's doing a lot for... 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, but how did it make you feel to know that he was simply trusted more than you to  get food?  Because you'd think getting food would not be the most arduous task.  I remember when I was an intern, 98% of the time I did, I was gangbusters when it came  to getting food.  Yeah, well, I didn't want to, you know, I didn't even have the opportunity at that point  to show if I was stupid or not, so I didn't...  Yeah, I didn't...  Well, maybe it was your personality that people got a whiff on. 
[03:54:00]  Well, yeah, hey, I'm a nice guy, come on.  Yeah, yeah, nice.  And I'm not a retard, so I, you know...  Right.  I feel like I can fulfill the small duties that are asked of me properly, you know, I  can't believe...  But then, what happened?  I don't know.  I guess...  Were you the one who didn't bring the napkins?  Yeah, I forgot the napkins.  Sal?  Well, I brought them crumpled in my jacket.  Sal, you put crumpled up napkins in your jacket?  Yeah, I put the napkins in the jacket.  If you were getting a food order from somebody, would you want them to pull crumpled up napkins  out of their jacket? 
[03:54:30]  Somebody would assume there's a chewed up piece of gum in one of them.  Yeah, well, you know, I had nowhere else to put them.  Sal, does that disgust you?  That's incredible.  Did he put those chewed up napkins in his pocket?  I let everyone down that day.  Did you ever miss the napkins, Sal?  Maybe, like, once early on.  Yeah.  But, uh, no.  Rookie move.  Well, that was my first run for coffees on my own in the morning, so it was kind of...  And you don't use napkins?  No, I don't use napkins.  Unless they're crumpled up in your pocket.  That's right, unless they...  And you're just handing them off to somebody.  So, did you realize ahead, did you realize before all this happened, that Club Soda Kenny 
[03:55:00]  valued Sal's skills as a food getter far more than yours?  Oh, well, yeah, I mean, it was obvious because he was always...  Sal was always asked.  How did that make you feel?  Um, not bad.  I understood the comfortability, uh, with Sal, so I, you know, I didn't really...  But there wasn't any, like, need to, hey, I want to step up and prove that I can do this  too.  Um, well, yeah, of course.  I, you know, I was always willing, but, you know, the comfortability factor and... 
[03:55:30]  Yeah, you could be as willing as anybody, but it's a matter of, on the other end, if  Kenny wants to...  But why didn't you step up and say, hey, Kenny, put me in, coach.  I'm ready to play.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Today.  You don't talk to Kenny.  Yeah.  Kenny talks to you.  That's the way it is.  Yeah.  Why?  You could talk to Kenny.  He's a person.  You don't think so, Sal?  Well, no, no, Kenny, Kenny, you know, when you're talking with Kenny, he's great, but  you don't need to bother him with whatever bullshit that...  But you can't be like, hey, let me have a shot at this one, K-Dawg. 
[03:56:00]  No.  You ever called?  The impression that I got from the beginning was, no, you know, wait to be asked.  Who told you that?  It was just how I...  I'm a viewer and an observer, and that's how I observed things.  That's how you perceived it.  Yes, absolutely.  What did you base that perception on?  Well, that, I guess, you know, Kenny would go up to Sal and give him the order, or give  him the card, and then he would...  And you were just like, hey, man, if he's getting the food, it's cool with me, bro.  Well, at that time, I was also hopping on the phones, because Paul wasn't here full-time, 
[03:56:30]  so I was hopping on the phones.  He's not here full-time now.  He didn't even show up again today.  When was the last time he did a full week?  Full-time.  Paul's probably listening, though.  Is he?  He's always listening to the after show.  He should.  So should everybody.  It's a great show.  He actually only listens to the after show, just in case there's any Paul mentions.  Hey, Colin.  Yeah, exactly.  Now he knows who Paul is.  Well, this guy in Flint, Michigan, wrote on the instant feedback, whoever is the intern 
[03:57:00]  that answers the phones is awkward.  He just answers with, O and A, if you've never called, you don't know to say your name  and where you're from.  Is that you?  No, I go, I say...  E to the Rick?  No, I say, O and A, what you got?  And then when they tell me, I go, all right, what's your name, where you're from?  That's just a different method.  Yeah, it's...  Yeah.  Everybody's got to understand it.  I think I followed...  I think I observed Paul doing that, so I think...  You don't want to...  Don't take anything.  Well, I know, but he's the phone guy, so I was like, you know what?  Think about it this way.  Yeah.  Paul has been here, same... 
[03:57:30]  I mean, Paul's been here way longer than Sal, technically.  I mean, he started before...  Who's made more of an impact?  For you as a listener, who were you more familiar with?  In the last semester...  Yeah.  ...when both Paul and Sal were here, who were you as a listener more familiar with?  Uh, I'd say Sal.  Okay.  And then once you got here, and you observed for a couple weeks, who would you say gets  more shit done?  Uh, I'd say Sal.  Okay.  Hotline.  That's on the...  Oh, wait, no, he doesn't have the hotline number.  He doesn't have the hot...  Is that right? 
[03:58:00]  Paul doesn't have the hotline number?  Yeah, Paul's been giving me shit lately, so I don't mind giving a little...  Eric, Eric.  Yeah.  Write all this stuff down.  I am.  This stuff is gold.  Um, so, you're okay being a second-tier intern?  Sure.  Um, yeah, I know my place, and, you know...  Do you think, now that this has been laid out, everything is crystal clear, Sal is simply  too valuable to go on food runs?  Now that that's been established, it's simply too valuable to the show to do that, and that 
[03:58:30]  was actually established by Sal.  He found it, he said, I am too valuable to do that.  But, now that that's been, that's sort of the law of the land, do you, how do you feel  as in, now you're the guy who go gets food runs, because you're not nearly as valuable  as Sal.  Well, you know, like I said, I know...  That's the law.  That's not me.  But, like, I know Sal's willing to help, but I also know Sal has a lot more on his plate  than I do, and I don't mind doing those things, I really don't.  I got all these chicks out here, they're like, wow, is that Sal, the intern? 
[03:59:00]  That's me.  He used to get food.  Should I start, like, crooning them or something?  Exactly.  Just pick up the mic and be like, hello.  I wonder what they're all looking at.  There's one guy.  I mean, we're doing radio here, so, you know.  Is that exciting to you?  You're excited yourself.  Are you, do you, Eric, you're a fan of the show, I guess.  I sure am.  So, while you're sitting in here, the whole time, are you going, holy shit, I'm on the  air, holy shit, I'm on the air?  No.  Well, have you thought about the fact that you're on the air right now?  No.  Have you thought about the fact that just like you, like, you were just a fan, um, you know, 
[03:59:30]  like, like, like Marky Mark Wahlberg in the film Rockstar.  Sure.  And you were just sitting there in the crowd going, stand up and shout, you know what I  mean, and now, you're on, you're on stage with, what is it, Steel Dragon?  Uh, yeah, Steel Dragon, yeah.  You're on stage with Steel Dragon, and there is a, an arena full of people.  I know.  Multiple arenas full of people hanging on your every word.  Is he going to be able to get food?  They all care so deeply. 
[04:00:00]  That's right.  Um, no, I'm not too, you know, this, I, I sure, as a listener, it's, uh, it's an honor  to be on air, but I was also on air, I was on the couch with Zilch's over the  summer, so I got on air a little bit with you, uh, for the after show one  time, so.  Is that right?  That's right.  You didn't make a big impact.  I know, I didn't.  I will say that.  No, no, no, I do, uh, and I do a stupid college radio show, so I'm used to being  in front of a mic.  Oh, you're trying to get plugs out?  You're used to, I'm used to being in front of a mic, yeah, but the only  difference is.  Well, I want to bring my listenership up by one.  The difference, the difference is, as much as you're used to being in front of a 
[04:00:30]  mic, the other side of this mic has people listening, whereas your college  radio show, nobody.  Whereas it's like, yeah, you know, I'll tell my mom to tune in or something, because  no one else listens, you know?  Sal?  Yep.  What do you think of this guy?  He's already, to me, he's a little cocky.  No, no, I really, I genuinely like Eric.  He's a cool dude.  Thank you.  Me and Eric spoke more in our first day of meeting each other than I did with, um...  The other one?  What was his name?  Oh, that's right!  I totally forgot!  Julian?  You had a really shitty intern with you.  Oh, did I?  And you hated him. 
[04:01:00]  Oh, I loved him.  Uh, so, so now, what about the other intern who's not here today?  Uh, yes.  The one who's way too old to be an intern.  He's just like nothing, right?  Yeah, I mean, I only work with him once a week.  Is he gonna be able to get food done?  Do you think, Eric?  I don't, uh...  He's done it.  Yeah, sure.  Is he alright at it, Eric?  Yeah, he's fine at it.  E-Rock?  Yeah.  Yeah, when I get coffees, he gets the food.  Let me ask you.  He's got a little thing worked out.  E-Rock the sex man.  Who is better at food?  This Eric, or...  What's the other one's name? 
[04:01:30]  Michael.  Mike.  Mark Cuban.  Mark Cuban.  Roland is trying to get that to catch on.  Who's better at food between those two interns?  Um, I'd say it's about even with those two.  Uh, oh.  There's been no problem other than the napkin incident.  There's, uh, as far as I'm aware...  Wait, wait, wait.  There's been one problem, and it's been the napkin incident?  The napkin incident.  Then I would say Mike would be better than you.  That was coffee, though.  That wasn't even food.  Oh, that's coffee.  Coffee is almost, you know...  That was coffee.  Listen, coffee's top tier.  You got grown-ass...  That makes it even worse.  You got grown-ass men who are sitting here at 6 o'clock in the morning trying to entertain 
[04:02:00]  some people.  I think they might be a little bit reliant on that cup of coffee.  Well, they got the coffee, they just didn't get the napkin.  What happens if they spill a little?  I know.  Well, it was crumpled, you know.  In your pocket.  Hey, let me get you one out of my pocket.  Yeah.  That's snot on it.  Exactly.  It's disgusting.  Well, I just threw it in there last second, and as soon as I pulled them out, I knew  I was, ugh, in deep shit.  Yeah.  Eric, you guys...  Wait, which one?  E-Rock.  Sorry.  The sex man, I'll call you for short.  Sex man.  You got heated today. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah, because...  You got frustrated.  Yeah, because I think this whole thing had gone way too far when it didn't need to.  But that's the beauty of this.  I know.  We take it to there.  It's not like I'm surprised by it either, it's just, you know, this is something that  just, I don't know, should not have gotten to this level.  But you know what?  Yeah.  Maybe it shouldn't have gotten to this level, but this is the type of thing that whether  people will admit it or not, and this happens to everybody, all you out there, this happens  to you in your daily lives, it's these little things that don't actually matter that absolutely 
[04:03:00]  fester and fester within a person until something happens.  And so it's much better that we tackle this on the level for what it is, that we let it  fester and resentments, and Sal walks around here, and he starts requesting a director's  chair or whatever else he needs.  Hey, I understand this intern's going to get Opie and Anthony's coffee, but who's getting  the Sal man to drink or something, huh?  How do you expect me to stay up and, hey, hey, Eric, while you're going out, why don't 
[04:03:30]  you fetch me a little something?  Make sure there's two sugars in it, not one.  I like it sweet.  That's right.  Oh, that's good.  Eric, does it frustrate you because you have to explain yourself on such a, like, you're  being questioned?  No, it frustrates me because I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble here.  Except you said you told Kenny that I was the one who went to Gary, Eric.  That bothered you somewhere.  I'm not going to lie to him.  It definitely bothered you.  You did, though.  I didn't know at that time. 
[04:04:00]  No, we said that already.  Take everything that E-Rock's done to help you, which I think you're bullshitting a little  bit, but everything that E-Rock's done, I don't think he's done much, but everything  that E-Rock's done to help you, take it out of the equation, it annoyed you that he assumed...  Oh, no, it still definitely annoys me, but like I said, Eric has hooked me up plenty of  times, so it's all good.  You know what I mean?  It's fine.  You're willing to look past...  Essentially, by him making that statement, it would only create a bad blood between me  and Kenny, which I wished and hope, still right to this moment in time, that it would 
[04:04:30]  develop over time.  Well, I will say, off the air, there was a handshake that went down between Sal and Club  So to Kenny.  Yes, there was.  And that was a beautiful thing to see.  Yeah.  And I feel much better about it now.  Eric, you started shouting at Kenny, though.  Do you have the clip of that?  Hold on.  How long is it?  30...  Well, there's two versions.  There's 17 and 33.  Yeah, just give me the short one.  Just as E-Rock, Kenny was questioning on some shit, and E-Rock, again, he was making  assumptions, and that's where, you know, that's where Kenny was misinformed, but this 
[04:05:00]  is E-Rock now screaming back at Kenny.  Stop playing stupid.  You're not that dumb.  Kenny, I don't care about any of this.  I'm trying to work with you here on this.  If you don't care, then just tell the truth.  You don't want to say it because the guy's standing right next to you.  I said Sal early, and you said no.  Was that E-Rock?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's not like a girl.  Your voice does go up a few octaves when you get upset.  Yeah.  Does this make your life more difficult? 
[04:05:30]  Because you are the man who was named intern boss.  When all of the others...  And the reason, as you said, the reason that you were named intern boss is because every  single other person on the staff failed at it.  Like, we all failed.  You were the one person who was left.  Yeah.  Does it make your life more difficult?  Steve Storniolo is outside the window pointing at his head.  We have other things to deal with than the fact that I'm wearing a hat.  Yeah.  Breaking news!  I have a hat on!  Oh, boy. 
[04:06:00]  I didn't ask you this morning.  Now, back to what we were talking about before I was rudely interrupted by that moron.  Well, he's an idiot.  You've got to admit that.  Eric, does it make your life difficult?  Like, with management and stuff?  Because you're the intern boss, and there was an intern incident that exploded and spilled  over on the air.  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, it does, especially when you have to be in charge of some people, but  I was trying to do everything I possibly could to make sure it never got to that level.  And that's why you started...  You got frustrated.  Because I don't want...  This is just... 
[04:06:30]  This is...  Again, this is something that shouldn't have happened, and nobody should be arguing over  this stuff.  I mean, this is a non-issue that blew up into a big issue.  And I'm sitting there, and I did all I possibly could, other than make...  No, except the assumption, which I apologized to Kenny, that he got upset with, and it  caused other problems.  But it wasn't malicious.  I wasn't lying.  At that time, that's what I was meant to believe.  What have we learned from this?  We'll start with you, Eric.  What have we learned?  Which, Eric?  Me?  Yes. 
[04:07:00]  E-Rock the sex man.  I learned that...  I don't know what I learned.  I just learned...  I just don't want to piss Kenny off anymore.  I really don't.  I try so hard to just make sure everything is smoothed out.  Well, then, I think you've learned not to make assumptions, haven't we?  At that time, it's...  Haven't we?  No.  No.  No.  Sal, what have...  So, Eric, you've learned nothing.  Sal, what have you learned?  A lot of stuff, actually.  Like, what's the big thing? 
[04:07:30]  What's the number one thing?  Uh, well, I guess, just, you have to be very careful in everything that you say and everything  that you do, because, honestly, like, you know, he was talking before about how he's  thinking about what all the listeners are thinking right now.  The entire time I was in here with the ONA today, all I could think about is, if I was  listening to this shit right now, I would turn the radio off.  And if ONA approve it, that's great.  But I just think that, like, this is such a bullshit issue that got blown into something.  I would listen to that bit, uh, uh, the whole, uh, break?  Yeah.  Seven times today.  Yeah.  And I probably will go home and do that. 
[04:08:00]  Sal, there's been worse fights on this show that people just rave about to this day.  Right, I know, but it's such a bullshit thing, you know?  Eric, the intern, I'm gonna assume you've learned nothing, because you strike me as kind  of a dull guy.  I'm not a dull guy.  Come on, I learned that a crumpled napkin is not a kind napkin, folks.  You see what I mean?  He's not as...  Come on!  He's not sharp.  That's a kind of, uh...  It's...  It's a unique styling to you here on his radio show.  Yeah.  Again, he would have been one of my picks for sure.  Uh, stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  They got a giant show planned for you.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Goodbye.
