<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Anthony recounting his disastrous Thanksgiving weekend in Massachusetts with his mother-in-law and her nearly blind, eighty-year-old aunt, Auntie Marg.  The trip, sparked by a request to fix a "leaky cock" (a bathtub faucet), devolved into a chaotic series of events including a trip to the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, excessive drinking, questionable restaurant choices, numerous bathroom breaks, and expensive hotel stays.  The entire ordeal was punctuated by the women's antics and their shared consumption of various prescription medications.

This was immediately followed by a heated debate stemming from a comment made by co-host Earl, suggesting that Giants fans are better-behaved than Jets fans. Opie and Anthony interpreted this as a racist statement, leading to a comical and increasingly absurd argument, resulting in Earl being dubbed "Racist Earl."  The segment included listener calls offering varying perspectives on fan behavior, with both sides escalating into hyperbolic claims and counterclaims.

Unexpectedly, New York Yankees player David Cone appeared in the studio.  The conversation with Cone covered his World Series win, his new contract, the Yankees' clubhouse atmosphere, his charity work, and various listener questions regarding other players, stadium relocation, and even clubhouse music preferences.  The planned "Corky Steinbrenner" skit with Cone, however, was cut short.

The show then shifted gears to the Furby craze, with Opie and Anthony discussing the exorbitant resale prices of the toy, far exceeding its retail price of $29.95.  They drew parallels to previous toy frenzies like Singin' Snore Ernie and Tickle Me Elmo. A caller voiced the opinion that the Furby hype was a scam orchestrated by radio promotion and the toy companies themselves.  The hosts announced their "Furby Police" segment, where they would contact people reselling Furbies at inflated prices, revealing they had already raised $750 for charity by auctioning off some Furbies.  They then proceeded to call a person advertising a Furby for $300, using dramatic music to playfully harass the seller, who, in a bizarre twist, offered sexual favors in exchange for a lower price. The broadcast concluded with the hosts announcing their departure for a Giants game, expressing their lack of enthusiasm given the team's poor performance.  The overall tone of the broadcast was irreverent, comedic, and characterized by crude humor, frequent interruptions, and rapid topic transitions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you for being with me.  You are.  Boy, right out of the gate, huh?  Right out of the gate.  All right.  Shut up.  I want to listen to this.  All right.  Well, because of this, this song was stuck in my head all weekend because of you.  Yeah, very funny.  Golden Girls, in case you forgot. 
[00:00:30]  Right.  That's it, that's it.  Right.  The Rock of New York, 1027, WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  I just felt like playing that song, that's all.  Well, look what I got.  I got my official program for the 65th anniversary, Radio City Christmas Spectacular, Opie.  You made it.  I made it.  It was my weekend.  It was his weekend with the Golden Girls.  My weekend from hell is complete. 
[00:01:00]  But I got to say something off the top about the Christmas show, Radio City.  They are right.  It is a fabulous time for young and old.  Really?  Anyone in between is in hell.  Children and old people.  But at least that, by the time I was sitting lethargic, drooling on my lap at the Christmas  show, wishing death on myself, at least I knew. 
[00:01:30]  I saw the light at the end of the tunnel on my weekend, Opie.  It was almost through.  It started Wednesday leaving the station.  You spent four days with the Golden Girls.  Not one, not two, four days.  So where do we begin, Anthony?  I don't even know how to start.  I guess Thanksgiving was spent up in Massachusetts with my mother-in-law, Anthony.  And, of course, every time I go up there, I have to do some kind of task around the house. 
[00:02:00]  Because I used to be in heating and air conditioning, so I guess I should know how to fix a tranny  on a Hyundai.  I don't know.  But she shocked the hell out of me this Thanksgiving.  I go up and she goes, are you good with cock?  Like, what?  What?  Are you good with cock?  Janet, but your mom's flipped her lid. 
[00:02:30]  What is she talking about?  You know, cock, because my bathtub is leaking.  Oh, cock.  Cock.  Mother.  They say it a little differently up there.  Up with the baston accents.  You can't.  You have to, could you go, you know, get some cock and help me out here in the bathtub.  What was wrong with her old cock?  My cock that I'm using now is all dry and cracked.  I need new, fresh, young, supple cock. 
[00:03:00]  All right.  So I'll go to Home Depot and get you a cock.  Could you please say it right?  And then twice.  And one, because then she's, I got my hat on, of course, because of my hair is like Link  from the Mod Squad if the wind blows, you know.  Anthony, do you always have to have your hat on?  What?  Every time I see you, you have your hat on. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, my hat on.  Right.  Yes.  She was scaring the bejesus out of me.  Oh, my Lord.  What the hell was going on?  Well, we had Thanksgiving with the relatives on my wife's side.  And there are a couple of cool people to talk to at the get together.  But for the most part, everyone's got to talk loud because Annie Dot can't hear. 
[00:04:00]  She's deaf.  They bring her all to the house.  Sit her in the corner.  She's the spitting image of Dr. Zayas.  Swear to God.  Obi, I'm not kidding.  You got to see a picture.  Yeah.  Dr. Zayas, but she can't hear.  So no matter what you're talking about, like I'm talking to one of my relatives and,  no, things are going great.  New York, you know, NEW, we're loving it, having a great time.  What?  Great New York.  What's that here?  What? 
[00:04:30]  Oh.  They're all being friends.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  But the fun really didn't start until after Thanksgiving.  Of course, you know, I took my mother-in-law and Auntie Marg.  Yes.  So is, I don't know, 80 to New York City here in New York to see the Radio City Music Hall.  Christmas Spectacular.  How about we stop you there?  It'll be a little tease.  Yeah.  Because we have lots to get through today with you and your weekend with the Golden Girls. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Segment two will be them getting tanked up on scotch.  I dropped them at another elderly woman's house.  Okay.  Yeah.  We'll get into that story in a little bit.  And let's get things rolling here.  The fax line is 212-957-WNEW.  The line is 212-757-1027.  On the way, we've got the Wallflowers and the Rolling Stones, too.  Shut that off.  It was stuck in my head. 
[00:05:30]  1027-WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Collective soul.  The world.  I know the Rolling Stones and the Wallflowers, too.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Went to the Jet game yesterday.  Where's Earl, by the way?  Earl had a racist statement that I want to...  Racist?  A big-time racist statement.  What did he say?  He says that Giant fans are more behaved than Jet fans.  How is that racist?  That's as bad as saying white people are more well-behaved than black people. 
[00:06:00]  Is that what he was saying?  Heck yeah.  You can't make a comparison like that between the Jets fans and the Giants fans.  The Giants fans are more mature and they're not as rowdy, he says, than the Jet fans.  I don't know if you can make the same comparison, Opie.  We'll have to ask Earl.  Why not?  The racism is all about generalizing.  All right.  He's generalizing the Jet fans and the Giant fans.  He's not going to come in here now.  Why isn't he going to come in here?  Here he comes marching down the hall.  But I was at the Jet game yesterday. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  One thing I don't understand.  Great game, by the way, as we all know.  He's laughing.  Why is the Meadowlands a non-smoking facility?  You're not allowed to smoke in an outdoor stadium?  A lot of these places are like that now, yeah.  That's completely ridiculous.  I don't smoke.  I'll be the first person to bitch and complain if I'm in a restaurant and people next to me are smoking and stuff.  But it's gotten a little out of hand.  You're not allowed to smoke in an open-air stadium.  That's kind of ridiculous, right? 
[00:07:00]  It is.  And I said that to Earl, who's now in the studio.  And Earl, what did you say?  No, I said they're trying to cut down mainly on pot smoking.  Pot smoking?  Yes.  Because Jet fans...  Jet fans?  Most Jet fans.  I'm not saying all Jet fans.  Not most.  This is coming from a black guy.  This is great.  I want to hear this.  Some Jet fans.  No, you said most Jet fans.  Go ahead.  I'll take that back.  Some Jet fans like to smoke pot during the game.  And Giant fans don't like to smoke pot during the game? 
[00:07:30]  I said Jet fans are more than...  They're younger as a whole than Giant fans.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Okay.  And not as well-behaved as the Giant fans.  Yes, that's true.  Oh!  That is true.  I hear black people like to smoke crack more than white people do.  What's wrong with you, Earl?  You're a black guy.  How can you honestly sit here and say...  Thanks for pointing that out, Alfie. 
[00:08:00]  Well, it is radio.  It's just funny.  This is coming from a black guy.  You know why he can't generalize?  I grew up in Corona, which is about 10 minutes from Shea Stadium.  Okay.  Jet fans are lunatics.  When the Jets played at Shea Stadium, they were nuts.  I mean, in a good way.  They were loud.  They were like real football fans.  Yeah.  So, Earl, when you're driving by like a Jet fan, do you lock your car doors?  I'm out on the road during a Jet game.  All right.  Let's say, Earl, you owned a store.  Would you follow the Jet fans through the store to make sure they don't shoplift? 
[00:08:30]  We're going there, aren't we?  Oh, God.  You started it.  Because I agree.  Jet fans are rowdy.  No, in a good way.  They're very vocal.  Hi, N.E.W.  Speaking of vocal.  Hey, I just wanted to remind Earl that the infamous ice-throwing incident at Giant Stadium  was a giant game.  Ah, yes.  Well, there you go.  That was a horrible incident.  No, I didn't turn out drinking.  They were going to throw people out of the stadium and take away season tickets, and they 
[00:09:00]  were all giant season ticket holders for many years.  Remember that?  The ice-throwing incident?  I don't recall that happening in too many Jet games.  They also cut down on, well, I remember being at Shea, where the stadium was literally shaking  from people just going nuts.  Oh, there you go.  In the playoff game, they tore down the, uh...  Earl, they were cheering for Joe Namath.  Yeah.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey.  Hi, what's up?  Who's this?  Uh, Opie Anthony and, uh, racist Earl.  Opie and Anthony, it's Anthony the limo guy. 
[00:09:30]  How are you?  All right, man.  How's everything?  Good.  The Earl don't know what he's talking about.  When I'm a season ticket holder for the Giants for about 15 years, and I go with my father  and everybody else, the Giants guys, they smoke way more pot than the Jet guys.  There was nobody there yet that's been doing anything.  I'm telling you right now, those guys, Earl does not know what he's talking about.  All right, but who has the record for assault and battery?  Yeah.  Giants fans or Jet fans?  Oh, well, at the Giants games, they take the, they take the, they throw the Donald Bills  in the circle, and they watch the kids jump over the fence with the security guards, 
[00:10:00]  and they throw a B-roll out of them at the Giants games.  The Jet games, they just sit on everybody's shoulders and do G-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets.  That's right.  Earl, you have no idea what you're talking about.  All right, Earl, you're getting pounded.  Thanks for that.  All right.  You're getting pounded, Earl.  I walked into that left-handed.  The Jets fans were well-behaved at the stadium yesterday.  Well, I like to think of people on individual basis and not lump them into a group of, say,  Jets fans and Giants fans as to how they behave at the games, Earl. 
[00:10:30]  I don't think maybe you should be doing that.  You know what I mean?  No, all I'm saying is Jet fans.  Would you say that cops usually pull over Jets fans more than Giants fans, especially  if they're inexpensive cars?  Would you agree with that?  Is a Jet fan more likely to get a plunger up his butt for misbehaving than a Giants fan  at the police station?  Let's say a Jets fan pulls a toy gun out while riding a bicycle. 
[00:11:00]  Will he get shot as opposed to a Giants fan pulling a toy gun out on a bicycle?  Who's most likely to shoot at the screen when a movie opens?  A Jet fan or a Giant fan?  We're really going there, aren't we?  Why?  Well, I don't know what you're doing.  We're talking football.  Very good, Earl.  All right, Earl.  Thank you for that.  Thanks.  It's Racist Earl, everybody.  It's his new name now.  Racist Earl. 
[00:11:30]  Okay.  Oh, brother.  More stupidity on the way.  We got some Dave Matthews and Pink Floyd decks.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  The latest from the Dave Matthews Band.  That's Crush.  Coming to town, of course, what, December 2nd and 3rd?  Wednesday and Thursday?  Something like that?  I'm losing track of time here.  Tomorrow, December 1st already?  Wow.  Got to thank all our Dave Matthews ticket winners from the weekend.  That was very cool.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You never know who's going to stop on by the studio.  I'm like, look at this.  I'm like shaking.  This is really cool. 
[00:12:00]  It's David Cohn, everyone.  I didn't even know you were coming in today.  Out of nowhere.  Out of nowhere.  How was your Thanksgiving?  It was nice.  Nice and quiet.  It was in the Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Got thoroughly soaked out there, but had a good time.  They didn't do much with the balloons this year, I noticed, on TV.  They had them tied down.  They were pretty much dragging them on the street.  Yeah, they didn't want them up in the air.  They were, because the wind got a little out of control, so they were seriously like two  feet off the ground.  That's not fun.  Julianna gave orders to the police to shoot any errant balloons that might be ready to 
[00:12:30]  injure a small child.  So, what's going on?  Not a lot.  Just enjoying the offseason, kind of reveling in the World Series, and got a new contract,  feeling good about it.  Well, first of all, congratulations on the World Series.  That was absolutely great.  Anthony, I've got to ask you one question, though.  Was George Steinbrenner drunk in the locker room?  He was a little goofy on TV, though.  Rumors abound, yeah.  He had a little too much Perrier-Jouet.  Sounded like that.  I mean, yeah, best team in baseball, but he was, like, slobbering it. 
[00:13:00]  I did my little impression.  This is the best team in baseball!  He was all weepy.  And he had his crazy Eddie outfit on.  We noticed.  He's got the turtleneck and the blazer.  Yeah.  You're wearing a suit today, I see that.  Yeah, yeah.  Not by choice.  You know, I had another deal today.  I had to go to and dress up, and I'm thoroughly embarrassed to be here on your show in full  attire here. 
[00:13:30]  That's all right.  It's just weird to see you're not in a uniform, isn't it?  Like when you see a guy, pro ball player, not in the uniform.  It is bizarre.  It's a little strange.  So what do you do in the wintertime when you're not playing baseball?  Well, actually, I'm one of the few guys that hangs around New York.  Most of the guys, you know, live all over the country, all over the world, really.  We've got Hideki heading back to Japan.  We've got El Duque heading to Costa Rica.  And I'm one of the only guys that's still around New York.  I've kept my apartment here for years.  I really enjoy hanging around, going to some Knicks games, Ranger games.  No Knick games this year.  Yeah, I know.  I'm kind of missing that. 
[00:14:00]  I can relate to that.  I've been through that labor deal myself.  Well, how do you feel being a player?  You could probably relate to what the ball players are going through right now.  Yeah, I really can.  I think they're in a no-win situation, rather.  Average fan's not going to sympathize with the money that's going around.  It's billionaires versus millionaires.  And it's a PR nightmare.  But from a player's standpoint, I understand you're trying to stand up for your rights.  You're trying to stand up for free agency.  And it comes across as asking for more money.  And it's a tough situation.  Do you feel like they're going to play this year? 
[00:14:30]  I think it's tough.  I think the only thing the players can do is stick together.  Because everything the owners can do to them, the one thing they can is play the game.  So the players are the only ones that can play the game.  The owners are still getting paid right now.  They've got their TV revenue in pocket.  And a lot of the rest of the revenue is tied up in postseason.  So right now, the owners have the upper hand.  It definitely puts a black mark on the sport, though.  Like baseball got that whole stigma after the strike.  It did. 
[00:15:00]  It did.  And we're still waiting for some of the fans to come back.  We probably lost some fans for life over that situation.  And I'm sure there's some NBA fans out there that feel the same way.  This was a big year for bringing them back.  Well, we talked to a lot of people, and they said between you guys having a great season  and McGuire and Sosa and stuff, you kind of snuck back into baseball.  This was a key year for you guys.  Yeah, it really was.  I mean, that shows you the damage that was done back in, it was four years ago, 94.  And now we're talking about healing the wounds of the strike four or five years later.  And it took 70 home runs and 66 home runs to get that done. 
[00:15:30]  And a great season by you guys.  You've heard from fans, though, a couple of fans that call up,  I'm not licking their shoes, those bastards ain't getting me back.  And, you know, like 20 years from now, he's still going to be the same.  I haven't watched a game in 1994.  So how do you communicate with El Duque and Arabu when they're on the road?  Because they don't speak much English at all, right?  Not a lot.  Not a lot.  I think El Duque's sandbagging us.  I think he understands.  That's the knob, right?  It's no habla ingle. 
[00:16:00]  And Hideki's pretty sharp, too.  I think Hideki understands some things, too, because he'll look at you.  And when you're talking about him behind his back, he'll whip his head around and look at you like he understands what you're talking about.  And when you try to carry on a conversation, you can't get it working.  It just must be so weird.  I mean, don't they want to hang with you guys when you're on the road and stuff?  Do they have their translators with them when you're out clubbing and doing whatever you're doing?  Yeah, it's a little easier for El Duque because we've got some Spanish-speaking players.  Obviously, the whole Spanish network's a little easier with Hideki.  Hideki, that's a real chore.  You know, we go out for sushi with him and we try to get him in his element. 
[00:16:30]  And when he orders sushi, he just gives it one swipe of the hand across the board.  Everything.  One of everything.  Yeah, he's a big boy.  The guy can eat some sushi.  Very cool.  You want to talk to a few of our listeners?  Sure.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  It's Opie and Anthony and David Cohn.  What a treat today.  We didn't even know he was coming in.  And here he is in all his glory.  Just signed that big contract.  Yeah.  How's that feel?  I wasn't scheduled to be on.  I just busted through the door and demanded my way on the show. 
[00:17:00]  He said off mic that he listens to Opie and Anthony every once in a while on his way to the stadium for the games.  That's pretty good.  He's the guy, huh?  You're the one that listens for the show.  At least it's you.  So with the big contract, do the relatives expect a real big Christmas present this year?  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  Phone's ringing off the hook.  You've got all kinds of relatives.  Not only the intermediate family, it's the cousins and the hangers on the peripheral that sneak through.  Hey, Dave.  Yeah.  Remember me? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  I love the way you play second base.  I need some cash.  Don't even know.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, Dave.  How you doing?  All right.  Hey, listen.  I'm wondering, coming off a 20-win season, why wouldn't you take a three, four-year deal?  Why'd you stay for just one?  Well, I'm not sure if I can make it three or four more years, first of all.  I don't know how much I have left.  But in order to get a two- or three-, four-year deal, I would have had to go somewhere else.  And I like New York.  I want to stay on the Yankees.  We've got a chance to win again.  And, you know, there's nowhere else I'd rather be. 
[00:18:00]  Very cool.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello.  Hi, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I just wanted to ask Dave what he was saying to the Boomer there during the perfect game  at the end.  Oh.  Yeah, you've got to know the Boomer.  Boomer and me are two of the flakiest guys in baseball, I think.  We can communicate on our own level.  We've got the two Davids there talking.  That's what it is.  Yeah, I think, you know, it's taboo in baseball to talk to anybody with a perfect game or a 
[00:18:30]  no-hitter.  You don't want to say the wrong thing.  You don't want to jinx them.  You don't want to tell them he has a no-hitter going.  I mean, nobody would even talk to him, but, you know, I was kind of joking with him.  I told him to break out his knuckleball for the last two weeks.  I said, if he had any cojones at all, throw this knuckleball.  Throw your knuckleball at me.  He's got a lot of cojones.  That's very good.  Were you disguising yourself there at the end with the hand shades?  Nervous, yeah.  Superstitious, you know.  Yeah, I was just, I really was feeling for him.  I've been in that situation. 
[00:19:00]  I've blown it.  I haven't really.  You know, I've been that close before a few times, and I was really feeling for him,  because I knew it would change his life if he got that perfect game, and indeed it has.  Thanks for an outstanding season.  I actually made it from New York to Game 4, and I saw it, and I was thrilled.  It still hasn't sunk in yet.  Yeah.  You guys are the greatest, the best of the game.  The best team in baseball!  Hi, N.E.W., you got a question for David?  Yes.  All right.  Dave, what do you think about baseball players getting paid $50 to $100 for their autographs 
[00:19:30]  at card shows and things like that?  Well, I think, you know, it's a double-edged sword.  I think some players out there, you know, maybe take advantage of the situation a little  bit, and I think there's other players that do some good with that money.  Some guys sign for charity.  Some guys do some good things with the money.  I think the whole memorabilia market's crazy.  I mean, to sign your autograph on a piece of cardboard, and it's worth X amount of dollars  to me is still pretty crazy, but there's a market out there, there's people that are  paying for it, and there's players that are going to sign. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, Bernie got in a little trouble.  He's in the paper today, huh?  Because he didn't stay?  Yeah, he stayed for an hour.  He was scheduled for an hour.  He stayed for an hour, and then some fans started ripping up his pictures, saying,  hey, we were online, and he didn't sign our stuff.  Yeah, I think it helps if you're going to do those card shows that you actually look  at the people and smile and shake some hands and actually stay for the time you're supposed  to stay for.  I think that probably helps a little bit.  Yeah, okay.  Man, you could just sit there with a piece of paper and write your name in a sports memorabilia 
[00:20:30]  store.  Hi, N.E.W.  It's like printing money.  Hey, all fans, hey, it's Ray from Long Island.  How are you doing?  All right, man.  All right, pal.  David.  Yes.  I know your pal Daryl is sitting home.  I was wondering how he's feeling, and if he's going to go visit him for the holidays.  Well, from what I hear, Daryl's doing very well.  He's out in Palm Springs.  He's going through his chemotherapy routine, and apparently he's tolerating it very well  so far.  He's obviously not out of the woods.  You know, everybody's still a little worried about him.  But, you know, she's a great guy.  He really turned his life around.  He's going through a tough battle right now. 
[00:21:00]  We think he's going to be back.  They're a great friend to stick by him and his family as well, and, you know, taking his  wife out and the kids on the field there.  My hat's off to you guys.  You guys stuck around thick and thin, and give them all my best for the holidays.  Same to your family, and thanks for the thrill.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, pal.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  Yeah, how are you doing?  Good.  You got a question for David?  Sure do.  All right.  Dave, I was wondering if you or any of your teammates had any reaction to the whole Bernie 
[00:21:30]  Williams ordeal, I guess you can call it, as far as the amount of money he got, the kind  of, I don't know, again, all I know is from the papers and TV, the trouble he had to go  through to get that money.  Any ill feelings, or I guess you guys were supporting him 100%?  No, there's no ill feelings.  You know, everybody loves Bernie, and he's a great part of our team.  It's a cold business.  Sure.  You know, he's got a tough agent who went out there and really maximized the market for  him, and it's the first time Bernie was a free agent, so he kind of learned what it 
[00:22:00]  was all about, and I think in the end result, though, as much money as he got, which is  an enormous amount of money, he probably could have gotten more elsewhere, and once the  Yankees got in the ballpark with their offer, he took it.  Well, there you go.  Can't blame him for that, I guess.  No.  That's what everyone's doing.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Listen, I wanted to ask Dave.  My friend Paul Huderman and David Vargas were the ones that picked him up to make the bus  for the parade that day?  Yeah.  Do you remember, Dave?  Sure.  Sure, I remember.  What was up with that? 
[00:22:30]  How were you running late, man?  What happened, Dave?  What's up with that?  Well, it was the night before, I was out with Shane Spencer, and he's the talk of the town,  and we got no sleep, and it came time to go to the parade, and so we just wandered out  on First Avenue and couldn't get a cab, and so I ran out in the middle of First Avenue  and flagged down your buddies there in the middle of a moving van and hopped in the front  seat, and Shane and I just rolled our way right up First Avenue into the Bronx, and it  looked like a scene from the Anski commercial, telling the gear shift between my legs, and 
[00:23:00]  couldn't get through.  The cops wouldn't let us through, and finally we got through, and we brought those kids  down to the clubhouse that drove us, and met Straw that day.  Strawberry came in, we got them some autographs, and believe me, we thought we were going to  miss the parade.  Yeah.  Those guys saved us.  And here at home, we're thinking you all got limoed to the parade and stuff, and there  you go.  Well, we had the Bronx moving van that brought us straight up First Avenue.  Hi, N.E.W.  Dave, how are you?  Good, thanks.  Listen, I was wondering what kind of music dominates the Yankee clubhouse.  Is it Boomer, or Boomer's Choice, and what do you listen to? 
[00:23:30]  What's your favorite musical act?  Definitely, today Boomer's pitching.  You can hear Metallica blasting through the clubhouse.  Right on.  You can hear Joe Torre just cringing.  Yeah, he doesn't look like a big Metallica fan.  Joe's going back in his office and putting on the headphones and listening to Sinatra, so  Boomer's got the Metallica cranking, and actually, I mix it up.  I'm a classic rock guy all the way.  Grew up in the Midwest, and I'm kind of an old school guy.  Zeppelin, Floyd, Yes, and all the goodies, oldies but goodies. 
[00:24:00]  The Who, I'm big into the classics.  Like the albums you used to be able to clean your weave seeds out.  The Double Yes albums were perfect for that.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  Yeah, hi.  Hi, you're on delay, so turn down your radio and ask David Cohen a question.  Thank you.  Okay.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello.  Hi.  They put the kids on the phone.  Huh?  Hi.  I just have a question. 
[00:24:30]  Do you think that they're going to move Yankee Stadium?  Good question.  It is a good question.  I was going to say, Jeter gets Mariah, and I get the 12-year-old.  I'm the 11-year-old.  He shows you a 35-year-old right-handed pitcher here.  Hey, watch it, Cole.  As far as moving the stadium goes, I'm not sure what's going to happen.  I think everybody, you know, deep down hopes the Bronx works out, and they renovate that 
[00:25:00]  stadium and make the Bronx nice again, but there's some major problems there.  Yankee Stadium needs a lot of work, and they need more parking, and anybody who goes there  knows, try to go to the bathroom at Yankee Stadium, you've got problems, and you try to  park, you've got problems.  So, it's a complicated question, and I hope they can work it out.  Very good.  Well, I think we've got time for just a couple more, and we'll let you go there, David.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  Hit another one there.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello?  Yeah, you got a question for David Cohn?  Yeah, hi.  This is Tom from Shorebrook, New York. 
[00:25:30]  How you doing?  All right.  All right.  I'd just like to say congratulations.  It was a great season.  It was a great win in the World Series.  Big-time Yankee fan.  I just wanted to know two questions.  What do you feel?  How does it feel playing in Kansas City compared to the Big Apple?  And what really happened in the bullpen at Shea a few years ago with those girls?  Who's screening these calls, man?  Let's go.  Thought I had some coverage here.  I think it's obvious you like to pitch in New York.  Yeah, definitely.  New York's a proactive crowd. 
[00:26:00]  I mean, they anticipate the flow of the game, whereas Kansas City, I mean, I love Kansas City.  They're polite, though, in the Midwest.  It's more like going to a movie.  You know, they kind of react to what happens, whereas New York tries to make things happen.  You know, they anticipate you get two strikes on a guy, and they're into the flow of the game, and they really anticipate.  As far as the bullpen at Shea, you know, I was young.  I've made some mistakes in my life, but I will never admit to that one.  I guarantee you that one.  There you go.  Hey, what's the David Cohen Foundation about?  Actually, we're doing some work with the Westchester Medical Center.  They're trying to build a new children's hospital out there. 
[00:26:30]  It's going to be one of the best in the nation from what we hear.  And we kind of mix it up.  You know, we do a little bit with Sloan Kettering and some of the cancer kids.  And, you know, we've helped out the LaBelle Foundation, which is for wayward kids in upstate New York.  So, you know, we're just starting the foundation.  We're trying to figure out how to make it work and how to allocate the funds.  But we've got some good ideas and trying to get it going.  Very cool.  Well, this has been a treat.  Unbelievable.  Definitely.  David, thanks for stopping by.  We really appreciate it.  Sure.  My pleasure.  David Cohen, everyone.  I mean, we never get a crowd in this studio.  So let's hear it for David. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  We still have David Cohen in the studio.  He wants to play DJ real fast.  And you want to hear this one, David?  Absolutely.  You've got to talk it up, okay?  Well, I'm a big Who fan.  I think one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time and Eminence Front, to me, is one of the classic songs in my book.  All right.  All right.  Now you've got to tell them what station they're listening to.  Oh, where are we at?  Hey, where are we?  Just kidding.  Listen to it all the time.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:27:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  The Rock of New York.  1027-WNEW.  The latest for the Goo Goo Dolls that slide off Dizzy of the Girl.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  The most talked about radio personalities in New York these days.  My goodness.  Can't open up a paper without a letter to the editor or an article on something we're doing wrong here at NEW.  Everyone is talking about NEW and Opie and Anthony.  I wonder why that is, Anthony.  I don't know.  Maybe because there hasn't really been much to talk about at NEW for so long. 
[00:28:00]  Mm-hmm.  And now something's happening.  It's like a shock to the system, so everyone has to talk about it.  All the other radio stations talking about NEW and who they've let go and who they've hired.  And it's like grandma getting a perm and putting on a dress.  Mm-hmm.  A nice dress.  All of a sudden people would take notice and go, hey, wow, look at grandma.  What the hell is she doing?  You know, they get a little confused.  I'm not talking about anyone else really in New York radio. 
[00:28:30]  No.  Except for the man, of course.  Well, of course.  We all know who the man is.  Scott Shannon.  Go on.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  All right.  So are we on part two of your weekend from hell, Anthony?  Oh, you know, I was just sitting around here laughing and everything.  Oh, thank you for being here thinking about traveling down and going back again.  All right. 
[00:29:00]  This isn't necessary.  Right when this song gets out of my head.  Yes, my weekend with the Golden Girls.  Well, yes.  I mean, you didn't spend one day with the Golden Girls.  You spent four days with the Golden Girls.  It started Wednesday.  I went up to the show.  Right.  I went up to Massachusetts to have Thanksgiving with my mother-in-law and my wife.  We went up there.  And it didn't end with that.  We didn't say, all right, thank you for having us and leave. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  We packed up the car with my mother-in-law and Auntie Mark, who is 80 years old.  She's like the lady from vacation.  Oh, my God.  She is, though.  She is.  She's blind.  She's blind.  She can barely see.  And she's got, I guess, at 80 years old, you know, you have problems breathing unless  the optimum air conditions apply, humidity and temperature.  So she's always pulling out the little, like, the respirator. 
[00:30:00]  What do you call that?  The little thing, you know, like the primatee mister things.  Yeah, yes.  And that was my weekend.  Did you tie her to the roof of the car for the ride back down to New York like I did in  vacation?  No.  You know what?  I was lucky because she slept.  Yeah.  Auntie Mark?  Auntie Mark, it's time for the Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall.  Oh, that doesn't sound good.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  It is 78 degrees in here. 
[00:30:30]  She is used to 77.  This could really shock her system.  All right.  So you got the whole gang down from Massachusetts back to New York to continue your weekend  with the Golden Girls.  Yeah.  So Friday night is an easy one because I have to drop them off at a friend of Judy's, my  mother-in-law, because she used to live on Long Island.  So we drop her off at this neighbor's house of hers, who I guess is, I don't know, she's  got to be in her, I don't know, 70s. 
[00:31:00]  So you had more Golden Girls.  You were gaining Golden Girls as the weekend continued.  Three.  You're up to total.  Three now.  Okay.  Walk in the house.  Yeah.  And I don't know if there's an old woman custom, but they start comparing prescription  drugs.  I'm not kidding.  They pulled, like at one point, my mother-in-law's talking that she's nauseous.  Mm-hmm.  And the woman over her house.  You know, it could have been the Scotches.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, no, it's not the bottle of wine and the Scotch and sodas. 
[00:31:30]  I asked for just a splash of soda.  Put too much soda in.  And then she's pulling it out, and the woman, Evelyn, I guess, pulls it out and she's going,  oh, Judy, look at these pills.  This could be making you nauseous.  I take the, is this the generic?  Like, it, and they're going back and forth and back and forth about prescription drugs.  Comparing their drugs.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Back and forth.  And I'm sitting at the table like, this is great.  Fantastic.  What were they drinking at this point?  Insure with vodka?  Yeah.  Insure shots.  Shots of insure?  Shots of insure.  Okay.  They're sitting there.  No, and they're getting tanked.  And I got to go.  So we finally, I got, that was my first reprieve from them, was we were able to leave that  house and leave them to their whatever.  I'm getting drunk.  I don't know. 
[00:32:30]  But then we had to come into Manhattan on Saturday and get hotel rooms, which, who paid  for that?  You did.  Must have been somebody.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  It was me.  This past weekend, I might as well have put a teller machine on a hand truck and just wheeled  that around with me.  Just slide it through.  Guess how much for parking for this weekend?  How much?  Alone.  Weekend, anyone?  I'll go 60 bucks.  Yeah.  $150 in parking.  That's no joke. 
[00:33:00]  Where the hell were you parking?  Well, first, when you think about it, I drive in and we have to keep parking at different  places because they can't walk within a hundred foot radius of wherever you are.  So we're taking cabs and parking.  So I had to park for the hotel and you get them a room, of course, at the Lowe's on Lenox,  which is a room that was like a postage stamp for $200.  Thank you.  Each room.  So I need one and Jen need, me and Jen need one and they're sharing one. 
[00:33:30]  And then we go to dinner and they're smoking like feasts.  Andy Marcus had cancer.  How are you doing?  How's what?  How's the radio?  What did you guys eat?  What did we eat?  Where? 
[00:34:00]  Oh, we ate at the hotel restaurant.  Because we walk around so much that no one knows what to do.  What am I going to do with two old ladies in Manhattan?  Not much.  What are you going to do with two old ladies in Manhattan?  Pretty much eat.  Yeah.  That's what you do with old people.  Because there's nothing to do.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to go to flash dances.  Catch us a lap dance.  And no, I wound up getting dragged to planet Hollywood.  Yeah, this is great.  My idea.  New York City.  Woo.  But it's just such a good thing that, you know, with the holidays around and the nice 
[00:34:30]  warm weather we were getting and everyone shopping, the biggest, busiest shopping weekend,  that Manhattan really wasn't that crowded this weekend.  Boy, there was no one in planet Hollywood.  Yeah, the tourists don't like to go there at all.  Oh, no, no.  And the whole city was pretty much deserted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I could go in there real quick and get the drink I really needed.  Yeah.  Packed.  Really?  Packed.  Five deep at the bar.  Did you get the Michael J. Fox martini?  Yeah.  Shaken, not stirred? 
[00:35:00]  I heard that's a new trinket plan.  Give Annie Mark the Clark Gable Collada.  Gee.  Yeah, I'll have the Stallone Punch.  Boy, this is really making me feel like a New Yorker.  Yeah, this is great.  Every rube is in there looking at memorabilia that, I don't know.  Is that the real shirt, Arnold Moore?  Is it?  I doubt it.  So do I.  All right.  Annie Mark, oh, did I tell you we had to stop 80 times on the way up or the way down from 
[00:35:30]  Massachusetts?  No.  We stop at every rest stop along the way.  And then finally they got to eat again.  So we stop at a Burger King on the rest stop.  Okay, we get our little Burger King.  Sit down.  Annie Mark, I need a fork and a knife.  Wait a minute.  It's a burger.  No, I need a fork and a knife to cut.  Cut with.  They haven't given out forks and knives since they opened, I believe.  Well, it's a good thing it wasn't that busy a holiday weekend because the place was pretty 
[00:36:00]  deserted, the Burger King.  No, there was plenty of room for me to go right up to the counter and ask for a fork.  And they weren't too bothered to, you know, look for it.  I need a fork and a knife, please.  Okay.  Fork and knife.  It was a hell.  Wait until you hear about the Christmas show.  Oh, yeah.  That's the whole reason they had to come down here.  Oh, yeah.  I guess that'll be part three of your weekend with the Golden Girls, huh? 
[00:36:30]  Let's go to the Rockefeller Center.  I want to see the tree.  It's not lit yet.  Well, let's go see it anyway.  So we went to see a big tree.  In Rockefeller Center.  And, you know, not many people go there around this time of year.  No.  Which is good because there was plenty of room to walk and everything.  Must have got right up to the tree, took a look, and it probably took you, what, five minutes?  It was packed.  You couldn't even move.  Shoulder to shoulder, people.  And I'm staring at this tree.  And it's just a tree at that point. 
[00:37:00]  It's not decorated.  There's nothing going on.  It's 65 degrees out.  And I'm with two old ladies.  The Golden Girls.  The Golden Girls.  Very good.  All right.  We'll get to part three of your lovely little weekend in a little while.  Got something for the show?  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  You're an L over there.  You got to be lying.  No.  What are we doing?  We've been working on this for three months.  Come on.  Get out of here.  Ask anybody in our meetings.  We're taking vacation time. 
[00:37:30]  We can't go to one of those messes.  No.  No.  We want you to be like the Dick Clark.  We'll be dicks, all right?  We will be a couple of dicks.  Dick Clark, you honest with me?  Oh, come on.  That's a joke, right?  No.  The top 99 artists?  Okay, then why don't you do the Opie and Anthony rockin' New Year's Eve party?  Yeah.  We could do that.  Rockin' New Year's.  We'll incorporate the top 99.  Top 99.  How does it work?  It's 99 artists?  Well, we're not going to have a countdown.  We're just going to play great songs.  He's serious.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, no.  Absolutely.  All right, so who's like artist number 99?  I have no idea.  Andrea handles all that stuff.  Like Blues Traveler Lee, someone cool, or is it going to be like Super Tramp?  And who's going to be the number one?  I don't think Super Tramp makes it in the top 99.  All right, good.  Let's wreck it right now.  It's going to be Zeppelin.  Zeppelin will be number one?  No, I don't know.  It's got to be.  There's no number.  It's not a number.  Well, then how come it's the 99?  It's an inclusive group.  We haven't ranked it.  So why can't we just run it as regular programming?  We can.  But it's just, we're only...  But there's going to be these cool little... 
[00:38:30]  The top 99 artists.  N-E-W.  So if we just eliminate all that, all the bells and whistles, it's just like our regular program.  Well, you can go into a church and tear it apart, too.  I have.  I have, you know.  There will be nothing left.  You know, sometimes you need a little pageantry, a little...  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Can we take, you know, some time off?  When does it start?  I already asked you today if you were taking time off. 
[00:39:00]  Well, you didn't tell us.  We're doing this.  We're Iron Man.  When does it start?  Three o'clock.  Three o'clock on New Year's what?  Eve.  It's not a countdown.  All right, we won't be here.  We're not in on New Year's Eve.  We're not going to be here.  It's not a countdown.  It's got numbers in it for some reason, but it's no countdown.  We can't be on top.  No, you have to have, you know, boundaries.  It's not going to be...  Number 24.  Nothing like that?  Well, if we could do those for us.  Yeah, I can do that.  We could do 99 of them for us.  I think our listeners are smarter than this.  They know it's a clever rouge. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  No, it's called a feature.  It's a program.  It's a feature.  Feature.  Feature.  Feature.  News is a ruse, right?  They have 30 minutes to do the news.  They can't run all the stories.  They have to run the top story.  It's a feature.  Okay, so it's the top 99 artists, but we won't call it that.  No, there's not a countdown.  You know, this is what the meetings are like in the afternoon before you go in the air.  It's nay on the umbers nay.  And why didn't we play Alice's Restaurant this year?  Yeah, whose decision was that? 
[00:40:00]  I would say in view of that last phone call, it was a tremendous oversight.  Oh, is that it?  Who's responsible?  Who will be getting the hate faxes and hate emails for that?  You?  I think we spread that blame.  Ultimately, yes, it always ends up there.  It always goes to Gary.  Okay, I thought that maybe that would get divvied up into everybody's mailboxes.  I think we did play it at 11.  People missed it.  That's a good idea.  It's not that we didn't play it.  We just played it early.  We screwed up.  Lisa Garvey blew it.  Yeah, we screwed up because of daylight savings time. 
[00:40:30]  Sorry about that.  Well, there's something to look forward to.  The top 99 artists.  That should get the listenership, though.  Number five, five, five, five.  Leonard Skinner.  Top 99 artists.  N-A-W.  Do you play a little block of each artist and stuff?  I don't know.  It's open for formatting right now.  Can't we just blow it off and come up with something like the listeners want to hear? 
[00:41:00]  Sure.  I tell you what.  Why don't you figure out what the listeners want to hear, and then we'll do that if it's  better.  Okay.  All right.  I'm open for that.  That's fair.  We could think of something, maybe.  Well, we'll see.  It's a new position for you, so, you know, have at it.  We're going to start giving away the tricks of the trade, though.  Coming up, we'll tell you how the DJ, you know, when they get a request on the phone,  before the person even requests a song, the music's playing in the background.  Right.  We'll tell you how that's done.  How did they get the song so fast?  Bye, Peggy. 
[00:41:30]  Bye.  See you later, Peggy.  So long, Peggy.  Bye-bye.  Guarantee you're still listening.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Little lovely Peggy asks in her facts, what happened to NEW's cutting edge?  And her definition of NEW's cutting edge, Anthony?  Yeah.  Is?  I have no idea.  What does she say?  She thinks that we should have played Alice's Restaurant on Thanksgiving. 
[00:42:00]  That's NEW's cutting edge, Anthony.  That's cutting edge, playing Alice's Restaurant on Thanksgiving.  Yes.  Although some people enjoy it, I'm sure, I would not call that cutting edge.  No.  No.  And because of that, because we did not play it this Thanksgiving at noon,  Peggy is changing channels.  Bye-bye, Peggy.  Bye, Peggy.  See you later.  Go tune in to the other station where the guy plays 5 o'clock funnies.  That's cutting edge.  People have gotten like their parents. 
[00:42:30]  These are the people that were supposed to be this revolutionary younger generation that  were totally rebellious against their parents, against anything old and standard and traditional.  They were going to break the mold, be this whole new generation.  And they grew older, and what have they become?  Their parents.  Their parents.  Exactly what they didn't want to be.  So, any changes?  Like your dad.  What?  Where are my shoe trees?  I had shoe trees in my closet right here. 
[00:43:00]  Well, you know, we don't use shoe trees anymore.  I need shoe trees or my shoes shrink.  Yeah.  It's the same thing.  You've become your parents.  Pathetic.  God!  She's leaving the station because we didn't play Alice's Restaurant on Thanksgiving.  Oh, how pathetic is that?  Very pathetic.  Leave the station because you don't like us.  I'll accept that.  But leave because we didn't play a stupid song.  It goes beyond that, Opie.  It goes way beyond that. 
[00:43:30]  And you think it's special?  Every rock station in America plays it at noon on Thanksgiving.  That's cutting edge, doing what everyone else does.  We're trying to do some different things here at NEW.  It was cutting edge the last time you enjoyed stuff, cutting edge.  Let's say that.  Because you know something?  You use the word cutting edge.  You don't like cutting edge.  You like dull edge.  You like file down till it's flat edge.  Because it's the truth.  They grow older and lose any sense of youth that they had. 
[00:44:00]  Humor, youth, spontaneity, cutting edge.  And then they email us crap like that.  Like we're not going to read it and laugh at you.  You're somebody with an old mind telling us what's cutting edge.  I don't even care how old you are.  I know guys in their 60s that have a great sense of humor.  They're fun.  They are cutting edge.  They have an ability to keep an open mind and think like a youthful. 
[00:44:30]  And then there are other people in their 30s, early 40s.  They might as well be dead.  That are fuddy-duddies.  Dead.  But I don't think you know what cutting edge is anymore.  So don't go trying to tell anybody what it is.  And Anthony makes a good point.  When you write a letter like that, Peggy, we read it and we laugh at you.  Yeah.  You think we sit here and go, oh, oh, no.  Oh, oh, we lost Peggy.  Oh, oh, oh.  Is it too late?  Can we still put the record on the air?  You know?  It's like when an old person comes up and sees kids dancing and go, you know, that's the hustle? 
[00:45:00]  What are you doing there?  The hustle?  I know the dance moves.  The new dance moves.  That's the hustle.  Yeah.  You just look stupid trying to talk about anything.  Oh, please.  But all the other thing, I guess some lucky ex-listener got a letter in to the editor of Newsday.  Yeah.  And he's encouraging all the other listeners or ex-listeners to fax and write N.E.W.  To tune away. 
[00:45:30]  Tune away about the changes they've made at N.E.W.  And how Opie and Anthony are the new menaces on the block.  And let me tell you something.  Everybody was.  No one was happy letting Dave Herman go and Scott Muni go from W.N.E.W.  They've been cornerstones here at the station for many years.  The station was built on Scott Muni, I think, for many years.  Yeah.  But think back to things like television.  Uncle Miltie was hysterical. 
[00:46:00]  A pioneer in television.  But it just gets to a point where you have to move over so Seinfeld could move in.  It's like you don't want to see Uncle Miltie on Spin City unless he's making a cameo.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Uncle Miltie getting on TV, wearing a dress, going around, wow, wow, wow.  People are going to watch and go, this isn't funny.  Yeah.  They're not going to watch anymore.  And it just wouldn't be relevant to today's times.  Right.  So you have to change.  Yeah.  Move on. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  You could use certain things that they did, be inspired by what they did.  But you have to move on.  Yeah.  And get to today.  Right.  And by the way, the point I was making with the letter to the editor.  You know, they were encouraged to fax and write any W.  We got two letters.  Two.  Two.  And Anthony and I read them while the music was playing.  We laughed their butts off and then we lit them on fire.  Still smoking.  Yeah.  So if you are going to, like, try to fax the letters in or send them, don't send them while 
[00:47:00]  we're on the air because they'll never get to the boss's office, I'll tell you right now.  Right.  So.  All right.  I want to talk about the Furbies.  All right.  We'll talk about the Furbies next.  All right.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Whole Celebrity Skin.  R.E.M.  Orange Crush.  Before that, from the Green CD, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  So Furby Mania has hit the city.  Jesus.  Did you get your Furby yet, Anthony? 
[00:47:30]  No, I didn't get my Furby.  Why not?  You're not waking up at four in the morning to wait in line to get your Furby?  No.  I actually heard that there was some women got into a fight in a mall over a Furby.  Yes.  And were biting each other.  Could you imagine that scene?  I would stand on the Furby line just to see the fights that these people get into for their Furby.  Well, we should explain this. 
[00:48:00]  First of all, why is the Furby the most sought after toy this year, Anthony?  Does anyone know?  No.  I don't know.  I don't see the attraction.  I guess it's just like the sing and snore Ernie.  Well, every year there's a hot toy.  Yeah.  This year it's the Furby.  Last year it was the sing and snore Ernie.  The year before that was the Tickle Me Elmo doll.  Oh, boy.  And this goes all the way back to the Cabbage Patch doll.  Remember that?  Yes.  I think that was the first toy that started this shortage with the people going crazy. 
[00:48:30]  This mania.  My kids have to have this.  Why are we believing the hype?  I personally am not believing the hype.  I hope if you're listening to us, you're not believing the hype.  It's all hype.  The toy company gets together and says, hmm, we need a hot toy.  So they throw something together like the Furby.  And then next thing you know, they tell you it's the hot toy.  The kids don't know that's the hot toy.  Yeah.  Well, something starts this buzz on these things. 
[00:49:00]  And whatever the toy is, if the company that makes the toy is smart, they start putting out limited quantities of it.  And that increases the value of it.  The value because, yeah, it's, oh, my God, you can't find one.  Now, last year, the toy company will remain nameless.  But you and I were doing a promotion when the Sing and Snore Ernie was big.  And we had a little friend of ours that worked for this toy store. 
[00:49:30]  Toy store.  Large toy store chain.  And he goes, guys, you want to see something?  We go down the aisle where the Sing and Snore Ernie's were because that was the hot toy last year.  Not one Sing and Snore Ernie.  People online waiting, trying to figure out how they're going to get their Sing and Snore Ernie.  Guy goes to Anthony and I, he goes, follow me.  Goes to the back of the store.  There was a whole room filled with Sing and Snore Ernie's.  Right.  Filled.  Yeah.  And every morning they put out four or five.  Yeah.  And then they have a big line of people.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:50:00]  Like, okay, here it is.  Oh, that's all.  Yeah.  Sorry.  So then it ups the demand for this stupid toy.  Mm-hmm.  And then when you get close to the holiday, what do they do?  They give you, like, a little gift certificate so you can buy the Furby after the holiday when they have, you know, more Furbies.  How is your child going to survive, though, without opening up their little Furby on Christmas morning?  How could they go through Christmas without a Furby?  But we're pathetic as a society that we actually believe the hype. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  This Furby is $29.95, means nothing.  Day after Christmas, there'll be hundreds and hundreds on the toy store shelves.  You watch.  Absolutely.  And this toy's for what?  I don't know.  Really young kids, right?  Oh, Opie, no.  Oh, no.  No, people are buying these things left and right.  Adults.  Adults want the Furbies.  As their own little pet, Opie.  Do you know what a Furby does?  It talks to other Furbies, Anthony?  It talks to you.  It talks to other Furbies. 
[00:51:00]  It interacts with you if you, you know, throw them up in the air.  He goes, whee.  If you put something in his mouth, he goes, yum.  And his eyes blink.  He sleeps.  You know what?  You've got to feed him or he'll get sick.  Well, without definition, Anthony, there's a lot of Furbies walking the streets of 57.  Yeah.  How about throwing a couple of hundred bucks at the smelly Furby I saw on the way in, on  the corner.  It's the same thing.  He eats, sleeps, wets.  If I threw him up in the air, he'd probably go, whee. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  So, I think we're going to, we're going to, oh, we got a call here?  This better be good.  We've interrupted our show for this.  Furby.  Hey.  NW.  Hey, guys.  I just want to tell you something about the Furbies.  Yes.  Two and a half months ago, I was tripping over these ugly things in toy stores.  Yeah.  Whenever I would stop by them, because I remember them, because they look like gremlins.  I don't know how they're not being sued.  I'm waiting for that to happen.  They look identical to gremlins.  Before you throw the gremlin in the water.  Yes.  Before they become striped.  Yeah.  But one of the local radio stations, which I no longer listen to, was pushing it for about 
[00:52:00]  two weeks straight.  And that's when the hype started.  And then they hooked something up with SAO, I believe it was.  Well, I don't think you could blame it on the local radio.  It's the toy companies themselves get together and decide, well, we can make a bloody fortune  if we make this toy valuable.  What, the toy stores?  But it's a total scam, because I remember sleeping, Snore Ernie, about mid-January, you  started tripping over these things again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And I guarantee by January 15th, you'll be tripping over these hideous little Furbies again 
[00:52:30]  if they haven't been sued into infinity by whoever made gremlins.  Well, I think that's what they're waiting for, the production company that made gremlins.  They're just waiting for them to sell a bunch of these things so they can take all their  money.  Wait a minute.  It looks like a gremlin, doesn't it?  But I don't understand.  You know, why even people want it?  They're pretty ugly looking.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know if you've actually seen one of them.  Of course.  It's on the front page of the papers.  It's just hype.  Yeah, it's really... 
[00:53:00]  It's hype.  And like you said, you wait a couple days after Christmas, there'll be so many on the  shelves, it's not even funny.  Tell your kid, get a picture of the Furby, put it on a card and say, hey, your Furby's  coming January 1st.  And then you'll still pay the $29.95 and not the $200, $300 like some of these poor saps  are doing.  I know.  It's such a scam and people fall for this.  Every year we fall for this stupid scam.  Yeah, and the toys from the other past years have dust on them this year.  Yeah, I know.  You go into that island, you're blowing dust off them. 
[00:53:30]  All right, man.  I'm a little bit disappointed you guys didn't do Corky Steinbrenner with David Cohn.  You came close.  We did a little of it.  Oh, we just did, they're the best team in baseball.  Yeah, we had Coney stuff on it.  Yeah, you got to do the corn dog routine, though.  I know.  Actually, you know what we did?  We got a tape of that whole skit that we did, and we gave it to Coney.  Oh, really?  Okay, that's great.  Maybe he'll play for the players.  Yeah, so play for the boss.  That'd be great.  All right, man.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  And before we get off the subject of Furbies, what stupid radio station in this fine city 
[00:54:00]  is going to do a whole promotion around the Furby?  The Furby.  Later on this morning, we're going to be giving you a chance to win a Furby.  Ho-ho!  Do you realize, Ak-Ak, that these are selling for $1,000 on the streets of New York,  but we got ourselves a couple Furbies.  That's right, Opie.  We're going to be taking your calls later,  and you could win a cute little Furby.  Furby.  Furby.  For your little tot.  Someone will do it.  Making a happy little fan.  No, no, no, no. 
[00:54:30]  This is what they'll do.  They'll make themselves look cool.  They'll get two Furbies.  Yeah.  And then they'll auction them off on the air and give the money to some cute charity.  Hey, that'll work.  We're going for the highest bidder.  We raised $750 for one of the Furbies today.  Yeah.  Hey, he's as cute as a dickens, isn't he?  Don't believe the hype.  I beg you.  But I think what we're going to do, maybe later this week we'll start it.  We're going to do something called the Furby Police.  Yes.  Because the ads are already hidden. 
[00:55:00]  The classifieds, all these people trying to make $200, $300, $400 off a children's toy.  Yeah, they take out ads in their newspapers and charge their high prices.  And what we're going to do is we're going to call some of these people and mess with them for trying to make profit off a children's toy.  We do sort of a scared straight program with these people.  Yes, we do.  We frighten them.  We did it with the Singin' Snore Ernie.  Yeah.  We did it with the Tickle Me Elmo.  Yeah.  And now we have the Furby.  Yes.  So, you know, stick around for that.  It's going to be fun.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW. 
[00:55:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  We got to leave?  Why do we have to leave today?  Giants football?  We still do Giants football?  Oh.  Oh, really?  I thought we could just blow off the games because they're having such a crappy year.  Oh.  That's why we're leaving early?  All right.  Stay tuned for another exciting Giants football game.  Can't wait.  All right. 
[00:56:00]  Is that a good plug?  Why can't we have Jets football this year?  Oh.  I've been going through the internet here looking for Furby sounds.  Yeah.  It was for a little fun.  Right.  And I found someone selling Furbies for, get this.  Wait a minute.  Let me punch it up.  $300.  They're selling Furbies for $300.  $300.  And it's not even December yet, technically. 
[00:56:30]  A children's toy that costs $29.95.  But now that Furby mania has hit the city, just like the Sing and Snorri Dolls and the Tickle  Me Elmo's, you're going to start seeing in the classifieds a ton of people trying to make  money off a children's toy.  Making money off of a kid's toy.  Yes.  Yes.  So, we're the Furby police.  You want to do, I'll do this real fast.  Give me the phone number.  Do we have any secret agent music?  Yeah.  Rick, do we have any good, like, um, Dragnet music?  We need some good music.  Some good FBI music or something. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, it's got to be a good cop show.  Yeah.  Something.  I got the Golden Girls theme.  No, it's not from that.  Oh.  All right.  Enough with the Golden Girls.  All right, we're dialing up this number.  We're going to be a weekend with them.  What do you, which one are you using?  Let me see.  Is it a good one?  Look what you use for the police.  Miami Vice.  Miami Vice.  All right, put it in there.  It'll make it goofy.  I don't care.  Different cop show music.  Do that one.  No, no, no.  Just do it.  Oh, look. 
[00:57:30]  Streets of San Francisco.  A Quinn Martin production.  Starring Carl Malden and Michael Douglas.  Scene one.  Epilogue.  Mommy, what's an epilogue?  All right.  You know that my brother's name is Quinn because of Quinn Martin Productions?  Because my parents were big TV fanatics.  And what about your other brother?  My other brother, Darren, is because of Bewitched. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  And then I get...  All right, Opie.  I know, but that's a stupid name I got when I was in seventh grade.  Julie Burson.  Thank you.  I hate your guts.  Everyone else had cool nicknames in seventh grade.  Hey, hey, freckle-faced kid with the glasses.  You don't have a nickname.  Stand up.  This is what they did to me.  Stand up.  In math class, seventh grade.  So I stand up and thin, got my stupid tube socks up to my knees, my cut-off jean shorts  because we were too poor to get the real ones.  Sitting there with my glasses, my freaking cowlick in front of the whole class. 
[00:58:30]  I was mortified.  It's not going to be Tiger Tank.  No.  So they start taking turns.  Okay.  One kid raises his hand.  Let's call him Four Eyes because of the glasses.  Then another kid goes, how about Howdy Doody?  And then another kid goes, how about Will Robinson from Lost in Space?  And then Julie Burson stands up and goes, I know.  Let's call him Opie.  Opie.  And I've been stuck with the name since seventh grade.  Because a lot of people think it's a radio name.  No. 
[00:59:00]  No.  All right.  It's a tragic story.  It's brutal.  What?  Give me that note.  What were you going to say?  A nickname.  He doesn't have the balls to say it.  Let me see.  Period head?  Because it's never heard of it.  Oh, what?  Red head?  My head's not that red.  Period head.  Oh.  Thanks, Ann, for not saying that.  That's just stupid.  All right.  You want to do Furby Police here?  Yeah.  So this person is selling the doll for $300. 
[00:59:30]  $300.  This goes for $29.95.  All right.  Let's start the Miami Vice music and try to get him out of the phone here.  Oh, no.  That's right.  We're going with this one again.  Give me $100.  Sir, I'm not going to commit to anything.  My husband is handling this.  I'm desperate.  I'll give you $100 in sexual favors.  Whatever it takes.  You know, you're just lucky.  You just called the state to police department.  This is being traced.  No, it's not.  Come on. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, the police department, and we're selling Furbies here at the precinct.  What is she, a joker?  $300.  For a kid's toy.  How dare you?  The Furby police get their first collar.  Yeah.  I feel good.  Yes, we'll do more of that tomorrow, but we've got to step aside from the Giants game.  So we'll see you tomorrow.  Matt. </pre>
