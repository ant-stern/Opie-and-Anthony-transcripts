<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a raucous celebration of Jim Norton's birthday, opening with the hosts proclaiming themselves "radio shock jocks" and launching into vulgar, sexually suggestive banter.  Jim Norton, present in studio, sported a Batman mask amidst Batman-themed decorations, and discussed his upcoming sinus surgery.  Listener calls flooded in, many offering birthday wishes, sparking discussions about *The Dark Knight*, Jay Leno's departure from NBC, and Jesse Jackson's use of a racial slur, contrasting it with reactions to similar incidents involving white public figures.  The hosts, using extensive racial slurs and derogatory language, analyzed a *The View* segment featuring Whoopi Goldberg and Elizabeth Hasselbeck debating the N-word and Hasselbeck’s subsequent breakdown.  Ted Kennedy's Chappaquiddick incident was briefly mentioned, along with a *Us Weekly* photo of Mandy Moore and Bob Kelly, a new phone number for Norton's fan messages, Anthony's mosquito bites, and a prank played on their driver, Master Poe.  Basil Teas catered the in-studio celebration, and Rich Voss was also mentioned.

The birthday celebration continued with in-studio guests Louis C.K., Rich Voss, and Jim Florentine, along with a phone call from Bob Levy.  A song dedicated to Al Sharpton was played.  The conversation veered wildly: complaints about female bosses, a reference to Malik's 7-Eleven video (possibly involving a firearm), promotion of upcoming comedy shows featuring the Opie and Anthony crew and Louis C.K. (with Voss promoting his Atlantic City show), Louis C.K.’s anecdotes about opening for Ricky Gervais and childcare issues, Jim Norton's early career stories (including unusual eating habits at Woodstock '94 and his meticulous gig preparation), Jim Florentine’s tales about their shared, mold and silverfish-infested apartment, a tour in Afghanistan where mortars landed near their performance, and his planned boxing match with Danny Bonaduce, and Bob Levy's stories of past gigs with Norton (including near-deportation from Canada), a snowstorm encounter with two 18-year-old women, his recent marriage, and his own planned boxing match against Danny Bonaduce.  The hosts criticized *Last Comic Standing*, and further anecdotes about Norton’s life and sobriety were shared.  Funny and shocking moments included stories about eating stew in an outhouse, the moldy apartment, inappropriate toll booth behavior, extreme flatulence on a plane, and the Danny Bonaduce boxing match.  The segment concluded with plans for a Batman and Joker skit involving Rich Voss.

A subsequent segment began with a vulgar anecdote about a noisemaker and a butt crack, followed by Louis C.K.’s story about a masseuse recognizing him. A satirically presented pre-recorded interview with Christian Bale was aired. Rich Voss's struggles with a script due to poor eyesight led to humorous complaints.  A discussion about a book on training husbands like dogs prompted crude jokes and a bizarre phone call.  A planned on-air birthday cake surprise and film crew arrival was hilariously botched during a commercial break, causing further chaos and a near-physical altercation among crew members.  Multiple birthday cakes arrived, including one from CW11. Norton revealed he was "commando" due to his cat.  A phone call with Dana White of the UFC discussed Rampage Jackson's mental health.  The segment concluded with more birthday wishes, cake, and banter, along with plugs for upcoming comedy shows.

A later segment featured the Black Sabbath cover band Sabra Cadabra, whose performance was plagued by microphone issues.  Dana White called in, discussing the UFC’s arrival at Madison Square Garden and Boston Garden, and recounted a humorous anecdote about renting the Viper Room for a Joan Jett concert. He also made a joke about buying a prostitute for Jim Norton. A phone call with Michael K. Williams ("Omar" from *The Wire*) discussed his role, Omar’s death, the show's Emmy snub, and filming anecdotes. Rich Voss called in, mentioning his appearances on Def Jam and *The Hulk*, leading to a humorous segment about Russell Simmons forgetting him.  A surprise appearance by Chubby Checker (also experiencing microphone problems) followed, discussing his career and upcoming appearances, including a free concert at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Louis C.K. contributed brief, witty interjections. The segment ended with birthday wishes and event promotion.

The final segments centered around Chubby Checker, discussing "The Twist," his career anecdotes (including mentoring Muhammad Ali), and his new album, *Knocked Down the Walls*.  A live performance of "The Twist" with Sabra Cadabra followed.  The hosts' interactions with Chubby Checker were irreverent and crude, including sexually suggestive comments.  Other guests included a prank phone call (initially believed to be Alan Alda), Brian McFadden, and Amy from the Penthouse Executive Club, who gave a lap dance to a host.  The show concluded with more banter, jokes about Chubby Checker’s hair, and discussion of his music.  The segment involved multiple musical performances and a substantial amount of off-color, sexually explicit, and offensive humor and language.  A segment concluded with a woman engaging in a sexually suggestive interaction with the hosts, removing clothing in exchange for cake.  The hosts made numerous sexually explicit comments, using vulgar and offensive language.  The numbers "M202" and "RFK" were mentioned.

All right, we get it.  All right, how's it going?  It's going quick.  Tor Johnson bobbing for gonorrhea.  All right, this is a bust, lesbians.  We're going to smell all of your fingers.  If it smells like a day in the fishing hole, you're under arrest.  Poor it is. 
[00:01:00]  We're blithering idiots.  That's fine, though.  I want more of my it is C.  It is C.  It is C.  I love you guys.  I'd suck all your c*** up all day.  Wow.  Fine.  I think that's an endorsement.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Happy birthday, Jim.  Happy birthday, Jimmy. 
[00:01:30]  I hate birthday shows.  Don't they suck?  It's the same thing.  I'm looking at Jimmy.  I could just read his mind.  It's just so awkward for the person celebrating the birthday.  And then I try to get around it and take my birthday off.  So stupid Steve goes, well, he's taking Friday off, which is weird, because that's his birthday.  So I guess we'll celebrate his birthday on Thursday.  No, I'm trying to avoid having a birthday on the air.  With that said, happy birthday to Jim Norton. 
[00:02:00]  Thanks for doing this video up.  It looks very festive.  Well, yeah.  I swear to God, it's like, I don't know.  It's a flashback to everybody else's birthday.  The banner's in the same spot.  It's a different one.  Remember mine?  It was all combat stuff and army things.  Yeah.  And this one, for some reason, it's all Batman stuff.  They went with the Batman theme.  I noticed.  There's a little Batman mask.  Put the mask on and say something, Jimmy. 
[00:02:30]  You got a Batman mask.  You got a Batman mask.  Put the mask on.  Put the mask on, Norton.  Oh, you get the good Batman mask.  I got the paper one.  Oh, that is a good one.  Go ahead.  Say something.  I'm Batman.  You're a tool, man.  I feel like an ass.  Let me take a picture of you as Batman.  Take a picture of me.  All right, hold on a minute.  Jimmy's Batman.  Wow.  It's uncomfortable.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  I'm the birthday douche.  There's my first picture of the day.  That's going right up.  Wonderful.  I am Batman.  I'm Batman.  How are you feeling today, Jimmy?  Good, man.  I feel okay.  Did you sleep?  I did.  Because I know you have problems sleeping because of your schnozola.  Yes.  Because I had to go for my CAT scan of the day and they got, the surgeon said my, I got  my results yesterday.  He said my sinuses are okay.  Really?  A little deviated septum in the nasal passage and my turbinates need to be shrugged.  Your what? 
[00:03:30]  My turbinates.  Your turbinates?  Two little things.  Yes.  I have fat turbinates.  Are they going to shave them down or something?  Yeah.  That's what they do.  They shave them down.  All right.  So you are going for a little surgery.  I want real surgery.  I don't want to just get shaved.  He's going to do a little reconstruction inside too.  Wow.  You want to do his and his surgery?  I'd love to.  I got a broken wing.  So maybe we go in together.  Link arms.  You're going to get a chiseled nose out of it?  Yeah.  Get a nose job while you do that and just a nice chiseled Hollywood nose.  Yeah.  I want to make it hooked down just a little bit like Quincy.  So I can do a better Jack Klugman. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Just to do a better Jack Klugman.  Nose job to look more like Quincy.  You'll ruin your face.  Let's say hi to Jacob from Missouri.  The phones are ringing like crazy.  A lot of happy birthday wishes coming in.  Let's acknowledge that.  No spoilers, Jacob.  And other things.  Yeah.  Jacob, we're trying to do the right thing with this Dark Knight movie.  So please, we will just dump out of you.  I mean, movies that are hacky and who gives a crap.  Yeah, we have no problem, you know, doing the right thing.  But not with this Dark Knight.  What do you got, Jacob? 
[00:04:30]  I just wanted to tell, no, Jimmy, thank you for ruining Batman form.  Seriously, dude.  Oh.  Did you laugh because of the voice?  Yeah, with the little Clint Eastwood thing.  I knew it.  I knew that would get to people.  No spoiler, but whenever Two-Face and Batman are talking, they both have the same voice.  Yes, I know.  I couldn't tell between the two of them.  I don't want anyone to recognize me.  So I'll wear, instead of a ski mask, this thing that shows half my face. 
[00:05:00]  I can still see the whole bottom of my face.  Of course.  I look like an idiot.  How did you like Heath Ledger, though, man?  How great was Heath Ledger?  Dude, he was awesome, man.  I mean, seriously, Opie, you were right.  It was Heath Ledger's movie, man.  Yeah, simple as that.  He blew Christian Bale out of the water.  And Christian Bale's a great actor.  I was on...  He's not...  Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.  I was on YouTube last night looking up Heath Ledger clips, just, like, trying to find clips  of him talking in the movie.  Did you find the good ones? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, did you find the one where he spits on his hand from Brokeback Mountain?  Yeah.  I don't remember that from the Batman movie, but yeah.  It must have been.  It sure was.  A joker in that scene.  Here's a little joke for you.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Yeah, but Heath was amazing, huh, there, Jacob?  Oh, dude.  I mean, but he was hilarious.  Like, he was, you know, this just serial killer, but he was hilarious.  Were you laughing at Gary Oldman because he looks a lot like the amazing Kreskin in this 
[00:06:00]  movie?  Kreskin.  Am I the only one?  Someone out there is going to...  Kreskin's an ass.  Be chuckling over that one when they see the movie.  And he does better magic.  Stupid Kreskin.  Kreskin's magic stinks on ice.  Absolutely.  All right, Jacob.  Great job.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Fun show.  All right.  If you're saying happy birthday to Jimmy, it's got to be quick and then just hang up.  Right.  To the point.  Jeremy, Cleveland.  Go ahead.  A little doting.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  That's Jeremy from Cleveland.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Joe in Connecticut.  Joe, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  I have something else to say, though.  Okay.  I think you've got to pick up the new Us Weekly.  I'm flipping through it.  I deliver.  I'm flipping through it.  And they have, like, shot celebrities at, you know, events or whatever.  And they show Mandy Moore cheering at this UFC fight.  And you see Bob Kelly in the background with a look like he's looking for the hot dog guy.  You guys got to check it out.  Oh, that's the picture that, yeah, we were talking about that a week or so ago. 
[00:07:00]  Is Jimmy in the shot?  Because Jimmy was in that same shot.  No, I was looking for him.  I thought I caught his ear, but no, they caught him out.  They probably zoomed in because Bobby was right behind her.  Yeah.  So they probably just showed her.  Oh, you get cropped out of a pic that's in Us Weekly?  Oh.  It wouldn't help me.  Us Weekly is read by a lot of people.  Enjoy your birthday, Jim.  Thanks, bud.  Just the guy behind her.  Probably like he's stalking her.  Yeah.  Jessica, California, what's up?  The beautiful Mandy Moore and some creepy Hawaiian.  Samoan gentleman. 
[00:07:30]  Jessica.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  I literally just walked home from the Dark Knight showing.  It was so good.  Yeah, the Dark Knight has already made $100 million.  So I was reading some message boards before the show.  One theater had it on 15 screens starting at midnight.  Wow.  15 screens.  That is amazing.  Christian Bale did suck so badly, though.  It was really kind of painful.  I'm a big Batman fan.  I'm a big Tompa geek.  And it was just sad after a while. 
[00:08:00]  But he was...  Christian Bale is a great actor.  They're right.  It's like...  It was very good.  It's not that he couldn't do it.  It was just...  It's like, you know, actors make choices, and that was the choice he made.  It wasn't like he tried and missed.  But I just didn't like the choice he made with it.  Why didn't you?  You never have to.  Get a hold of yourself, Batman.  We know it.  Get a hold of yourself.  Yeah.  Call Michael Caine.  I get changing the voice and stuff.  But even when he was alone in the room with Morgan Freeman's character, where that guy  knew he was Batman.  He was still doing the voice.  Oh, okay.  Did you actually say Morgan Freeman's character? 
[00:08:30]  No, you just said Morgan Freeman.  Batman was in a scene with Morgan Freeman, who played Morgan Freeman in The Dark Knight.  I loved you in Shawshank Redemption.  Yeah.  Morgan, Morgan, I need another vehicle.  Yeah, this movie's so hot, we gotta do a bunch of things with it.  We gotta do a montage of Morgan Freeman in all the movies we've done.  In all of his movies, where he's just doing a friggin' narration.  And you have to try to figure out which movie Morgan Freeman is playing Morgan Freeman in.  It's the same character.  Can we get that going? 
[00:09:00]  Yes, sir.  All right, Jessica, thank you.  Whether he's the president when an asteroid hits the Earth, or a prison inmate, same delivery.  People digging the movie?  Are they liking this?  Yeah, it's five stars all over the place.  It's ridiculous.  And we were noticing in the office, when a movie's really good and gets good reviews,  it's from Ebert and Roper, Rolling Stone Magazine, New York Times.  Like, it'll say, wow, this one blew me away, whoever, from the New York Times. 
[00:09:30]  And you can tell when a movie really blows, because it's like, this movie blew me away,  best movie of the year, Bob's Blog.  Bob's Movie Blog.  Bob's Movie Blog dot com.  Yeah.  Chet from Ohio Weekly.  Yeah.  It's just, you know the movie rots.  Oh, no.  Is that one, yeah, here's Space Chimps, got a really bad review, the animation of Space  Chimps.  And here's one of the reviews.  A family charmer that's out of this world. 
[00:10:00]  And that's from Janet Stokes from the Film Advisory Board.  Ugh.  Well, you know.  Space Chimps got zero stars, one star.  That's it.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I just thought, Jay, I'm done with NBC.  I just hate to see Leno.  He's going to do great.  Jay Leno's finally starting to talk about the fact that he's not going to be with NBC  after next year, I guess.  Sometime next year, he's going to be replaced by Conan O'Brien.  And everyone is still scratching their heads going, why would you do this?  Jay Leno's still the ratings king of late nights. 
[00:10:30]  And ABC is hinting they want him and a few other outlets that Jay's going nowhere.  He's just going to move his show somewhere else.  Yeah.  I just hate to see him getting, because Conan and I think we'll do okay, but you hate to  see Jay just being kind of outed, like ousted, you know, because he's done a great job there,  man.  That's kind of how they treated Johnny.  Johnny was different.  Johnny was 30 years in, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  He was getting a little old.  Jay's like, how old is Jay?  He's in his early 50s?  Yeah, Jay hasn't slowed down whatsoever. 
[00:11:00]  The ratings are as strong as ever, and you know.  Dude's an animal.  He goes out and does gigs.  It's going to be NBC's loss, because someone else is going to pick him up, and he's going  to kill everybody.  Yeah.  Leno is just, I don't know why anybody would get rid of Leno.  He murders.  He was winning without writers.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah, during the strike.  He's just great.  Wait, he didn't have writers.  Letterman did, and he was beating Letterman still, right?  It was very close.  He didn't kill him, but it was very close, but I think he still edged out Letterman.  I could be wrong, but I think he did.  All right, let's say hi to Paul in D.C.  Paul.  Hey, boys. 
[00:11:30]  Hey, Paul.  Hey, Paul.  It's my birthday, too, Jimmy, so happy birthday to us.  Happy.  Mine's actually tomorrow.  Today's just a day early.  Yeah.  Because the guys wanted to do a Saturday show, but I was like, no, we really shouldn't.  Yeah, yeah.  So I got the book.  I love it.  And you guys rock.  Come back to D.C.  Oh, cool.  We'll do that.  Let's go to Joe in New York.  Joe.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Thank you very much.  I didn't seem like anybody here remembered.  Yes, buddy. 
[00:12:00]  Have a happy birthday.  Don't do anything stupid.  Don't go down and get those little girls in the streets.  Oh, I'm a good boy.  Come on.  Jimmy's a good boy.  Let's go to John in Long Island.  John?  Speaking very loudly, wasn't he?  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy.  What?  Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Talking into this device, which you could hear if I whisper.  Today.  Today.  Hello, sir.  John?  Hi, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Jimmy.  My birthday's...  Hello?  Yeah, I'm right here.  All right.  Yeah.  My birthday's today and my son's birthday's Sunday. 
[00:12:30]  It's nice to surround greatness of Jimmy Norton.  Well, thank you, sir.  To you and your son.  You have a nice...  Hey, you have a nice birthday tomorrow, kid.  Yeah, you too.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to...  Let's say wishes.  Let's go to Justin in New Hampshire.  Justin.  Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Me.  You going to smash Steve for ruining your surprise yesterday?  How does Justin know?  I have a...  I'll explain.  I have a phone number that I gave out, and I updated it, and one of the things I did  was describe dumb Steve yesterday in the office. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, okay.  Wait, you give out a phone number?  Is that so much...  You want to plug?  Yeah, I will.  Yeah, today.  It's actually a number that if you leave me a message, I leave outgoing messages, and  I can hear fan messages.  You can hear each other's messages, and there's no charge, and I can actually respond to fans.  I got like a...  That sounds silly.  Hey...  Sounds like just another way to pick up girls.  No.  Dude, I thought that too, but there's five...  No, really.  It's going to help my fan base.  There's five...  I got like 500 messages yesterday. 
[00:13:30]  That's awesome.  Yeah.  That's very cool.  I'll give out the number.  Oh, so you did talk about what we were talking about after the show yesterday.  I made fun of Steve.  I wasn't going to give it away, but I'm like, ah, why not?  I was like, he's just the worst secret keeper ever.  I know.  Steve was basically talking about all the surprises we had for Jim Norton's birthday.  With Jim in the room.  There you go.  And one of the big surprises is this CW11 is coming in today to film the birthday celebration.  Extravaganza. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Jill is coming in with a little camera.  What time are they coming?  I don't know.  Okay.  I don't know.  Later on.  It's a surprise.  Oh, the time is a surprise.  Oh, the time is a surprise.  Dude, thanks.  Wow.  Steve.  Hey, this is a number you can leave me a message at, and I will get them.  And you're not going to be charged.  It literally is a cell phone charge.  Whatever your dumb carrier charges you, it's 917-267-2602.  That's real.  I bet two or three calls right now.  I hope so. 
[00:14:30]  Some of the fan messages were fun.  I actually enjoyed listening.  We should play some of them on the air.  You know what it is?  I have to hook up.  There's a widget you can put.  I'll put it on my MySpace by Monday.  Widget.  A little widget where people can just go, and you can listen to every fan message that's  been left in a row.  You can just go online and listen to them, so you don't have to sit there in front of  your phone.  Oh, that's a great little idea.  That's a lot of fun, actually.  I left like three outgoings yesterday.  I'm going to update this thing constantly.  I love it.  Yeah.  Did you get your iPhone working and synced up with your... 
[00:15:00]  No, but I synced it up with my desktop.  Oh, okay.  So I saved my information.  So I saved my information.  It was the laptop.  But I think I corrupted something on the laptop.  Yes.  But I saved my information, so it's backed up.  Corrupt.  All right.  Laptop's corrupt.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Hey, morning, guys.  Good morning.  Yeah, hey, Jim.  Opie, happy birthday.  You know, thank you, Rob.  Every year, no one celebrates my birthday because it falls on the same day as Jim Norton.  Thank you so much for acknowledging that, Rob. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, you're welcome.  Have a good one.  All right.  All right.  I get it.  That hurts.  Anthony is itching like a mother effer.  Oh, I'm putting some Benadryl cream on three mosquito bites that I swear must have been  mutated by an atomic bomb.  These mosquitoes.  It itches so bad.  I want to tear the skin off like that scene in Poltergeist.  How do you get mosquito bites?  I guess I was out in my yard at some point and a couple of skeeters got out there.  I need some tiki torches. 
[00:16:00]  I need tiki torches.  You need you need to spray, man.  Bug zapper?  No.  Spray what?  You need to spray.  Yes.  Off.  Any of that crap.  Get that propane thing.  That works like crazy.  Fries them.  No, it it attracts them into a little trap and they die.  It attracts the females.  But you put it in a corner.  You don't even hear it.  And it takes a month for a tank to burn off and you don't get any mosquitoes for a half  acre.  I like it.  It's fantastic.  Really?  Yeah, I heard about that a few years back. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, I got one.  It works like crazy.  Works good?  Yep.  All right.  What does it send a little signal out?  Border it.  It sends out a pheromone and all the females, the breeders come in and they get trapped in  a little thing and they and they just die.  But do men show up too?  No.  Smells like mosquito.  Yes, it does.  And the girls just can't refuse it.  A little Barry White mosquito music.  Dumb floors walking.  You gotta get bug spray though, man.  It takes about a week and a half and it works.  Wow.  Clears it out.  Why no bug spray?  I don't have bug spray yet.  I really wasn't spending much time outside. 
[00:17:00]  Now I gotta get bug spray.  Yeah.  But I also gotta get, you know, I think citronella.  Also, I know we're all excited about Jim Norton's birthday, but you really dressed up for his  birthday this morning, I see there, Anthony.  Oh, no.  That's unlike you.  It was kind of nice at all.  It was very nice of Anthony to really dress to the nines for your birthday, Jimmy.  I knew the CW-11 was gonna be down here, so I figured I'd dress nice.  Actually, these are the same clothes I wore last night.  Well, that's what I was getting at.  Of course.  Of course they were. 
[00:17:30]  Which, by the way, I had a buy last night.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We went to Bloomingdale's.  Bought some stuff.  Actually, what Jill's wearing, she wore a little safari suit.  It's adorable.  She had a buy stuff yesterday, Tim?  You bought her a phone?  I got a little safari suit.  Yeah.  She looks adorable in it.  We pulled a little gag on Master Poe yesterday.  We had a meeting here at CBS after the show.  I guess you could call it that.  Yeah, it was a little meeting with a sponsor. 
[00:18:00]  It was a schmooze fest.  What time did that meeting start?  I don't know, 11.30 or something.  About 11.30.  So Master Poe had to pull my truck up in front of CBS, and then I told him,  hang out, when the meeting's done, we'll be down.  So we walked down, and I see a cop is rolling down the side of the road going,  Move your vehicles.  Move your vehicles.  You're not allowed to park here.  Move.  So Master Poe takes off like he's got 10 kilos of coke in the back of the Escalade. 
[00:18:30]  I'm like, Poe, Poe, Poe, but he just drove off.  Yeah.  So I get a text from him going, got chased away, going around the block.  I'm like, okay.  So me and Jill go, let's go to Rue.  So we went into Rue.  We got something to eat and drink, and then I keep texting him going,  Poe, this meeting is getting outrageous.  I go, they're bringing their friends and family in.  I go, we have to meet with them.  We're signing autographs.  I go, it's taking forever.  More sponsors are showing up. 
[00:19:00]  I go, I'm really sorry.  Just hang out in the truck for a little longer.  No problem.  And we went to another place.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You know what time we got to the truck?  3.30.  He was in your truck for four hours?  Four hours.  Oh, my God.  He's as dumb as they come.  With me texting going, oh, I'm so sorry.  Oh, this meeting won't end.  I go, I'm so annoyed.  I want to get out of here.  No worries.  Uzz.  Do you know how many Master Poe farts were cutting your hair?  Oh, my God. 
[00:19:30]  I know.  Wow.  You know how many drug runs he probably went on?  There was.  I've gotten into that truck after a few times.  And, wow, Poe was eating some rice and beans or something.  Yeah, that was a funny little gag.  That's wonderful.  Let's say hi to Batman.  Calling it here.  Batman.  Batman.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, how are you?  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you very much.  I really don't appreciate you making fun of me. 
[00:20:00]  I wasn't.  I was tributing you.  Oh, well, you know, I think you're really cute with your shaved head.  Thank you.  We're both running out of steam.  You have a good one, okay?  Take care, man.  All right, there goes Batman.  Yes, they'll be in tomorrow morning.  Yes, tomorrow morning.  And the worst secret keeper ever.  Unbelievable.  Danny had a funny line.  He said, you're watching Sixth Sense.  And he goes, oh, you can't even tell he's dead through the whole movie. 
[00:20:30]  We have to go to break.  We can beat up Steve after the break, certainly.  Jim Norton's birthday today.  Very festive studio.  We got Basil Teas in-house once again, cooking all the food that we know and love.  Thank you.  Fantastic.  Basil Teas, Hooper Avenue, Tom's River.  See, I remember that crap.  And Bob in Scranton, Marcos in Yonkers, Robin in Detroit, and Brandon in Buffalo all saying,  happy birthday to you, Jimmy.  Oh, good.  We're not going to be able to get to everybody's phone calls.  So, there you go.  Thanks for calling. 
[00:21:00]  877-212-ONA.  It's Jimmy Day.  Shut up.  A celebration in honor of James Norton.  Oh, man.  Oh, hairs.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, Jimmy.  You f***ed.  Me, Ozzy.  Happy birthday.  And I have many more to come.  It's Jim Norton's birthday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Here, check it out, the Opie and Anthony Show.  It is Jim Norton's birthday. 
[00:21:30]  Can I point out some of the problems that we're having already?  I would like that very much.  What?  That's Ozzy wishing Jimmy a happy birthday two years ago.  That was nice.  Yeah.  That's not a new happy birthday to Jim Norton from Ozzy.  Ozzy should call you every year and wish you a happy birthday.  I think Ozzy should call me weekly.  Yeah.  Just to say hi.  How are you doing?  I think you're going to notice a lot of happy birthday wishes that were recorded many years  ago for your birthday.  That was amazing.  You guys pulled it off last year.  That was last year, I believe. 
[00:22:00]  Was it last year?  Yeah.  And Ozzy left me birthday messages.  That was such a great gift.  That's very cool, yes.  Yes, they'll be coming in at exactly seven.  Yes.  By the way, Basil Tease is here and Jimmy's enjoying the food.  And remember, Jimmy, on your birthday, calories don't pay attention.  Oh, that's funny.  You're a lot of money.  Whatever the hell you want on your birthday, and the calories will say, okay, you got me  today.  Hopefully the day before your birthday, you're allowed to not work out because you spent the  day just treating your body horribly, picking your Craigslist ads. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, boy.  I did.  You're not panicking when you're hitting 40.  Sitting there like a monkey.  Find anything good?  No, just photos.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, just awful.  Yeah, we got Rich Voss here.  He's looking at the basil tea food there.  You can join the show, Rich.  Jesus.  I'm getting food.  All right, then go get some food.  It's free.  Go get some food.  Well, it's in the middle.  It's almost done.  This is what I need from you, though.  We need a little story about Jim Norton for his birthday, maybe one you haven't told yet  on the air. 
[00:23:00]  That might be tough because you've been around a long time, but maybe a Jim Norton story  for his birthday.  Think about it.  My county rest area stories.  God, those are the best.  Love those.  A couple things really fast.  I guess Willie Randolph was the problem because the Mets have only 10 straight games.  Remember we were all feeling bad for Willie?  How he was fired in the middle of the night in L.A. or wherever he was?  Well, it looks like the Mets organization knows what they're doing because they have now  won 10 straight. 
[00:23:30]  It's hysterical.  So F Willie Randolph and his family.  Changed quickly.  Exactly.  I'm sitting there like, I can't believe they would do that to him.  You know, if you don't pay attention to a team, it really is odd because I remember  it's like, oh boy, the Mets dropped five straight.  And then it seems like two days later, hey, it's a 10-game winning streak.  Like, wait, how did that happen?  Well, when you play like 400 games a season, you can kind of zone out here and there for 
[00:24:00]  a month.  It goes pretty quickly.  You can zone out for a month and not really miss much.  Your team stays pretty much in the same place in the standings and all that crap.  Yeah, the Mets are on a tear.  Speaking of baseball, it was nine years ago that David Cohn did his perfect game.  Oh.  Remember that?  And something else happened on this date.  39 years ago today.  Who wants to try to guess this one?  39 years ago.  We're talking 1969.  And what's the date?  Today?  July 18th.  I would say the Apollo 11. 
[00:24:30]  Ah!  I don't think it landed.  No.  No.  But it has something to do with Apollo 11.  Ah!  18, 19, 20, 21st.  Did they launch?  It has nothing to do with the Apollo 11.  Well, I think they were on their way.  Yeah.  July 18th.  I think July 21st they landed. 
[00:25:00]  Was it?  Stunt brain?  20.  20th?  Yeah.  They landed?  Yeah, they were up in the air by now.  Yeah.  1968.  Oh.  Aren't we supposed to get Buzz Aldrin?  This person...  Yeah, we're going to have him on very soon.  It's a surprise.  Buzz Aldrin's coming in.  This person was in the news recently.  Estelle Getty was arrested for prostitution.  Again.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Let's see.  39 years.  1969. 
[00:25:30]  It's not Woodstock.  That's August.  Oh, God.  69.  You guys love this story, too.  It involved swimming?  Swimming.  Mark Spitz.  No, that was the 70s.  Well, one was able to swim.  The other one wasn't able to swim.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, Chappaquiddick.  Ted and Mary Jo Kopechny.  Ted Kennedy drove off a bridge 39 years ago today.  Wow.  Yeah.  By the way, I'm on page 21 of the post.  Still can't find that Jesse Jackson update. 
[00:26:00]  No, huh?  Huh.  Eh, they just left it alone.  It's not really news.  Why not?  Meh.  Well, isn't Reverend Al, like, disappointed or something?  That's the best he could do?  He's outraged.  He's mad, but he still holds him in high self-esteem.  It was the worst attack you've ever heard.  I wonder if he's going to protest Jesse or call for action.  Right.  Where's the call for action, fatso?  Call for action.  Where's all his peeps to march?  Can we get the Reverend Al on you?  In front of the Rainbow Coalition offices with his action network. 
[00:26:30]  So, Jesse Jackson has trashed Jews, he drops an N-bomb, and he wants to cut off Obama's  testicles, and there's just no price to pay.  No outrage.  Of course not.  Well, because he's black.  He's still looked at as an amazing religious man, a leader in the community.  Ugh.  He's not.  He's not.  He's not.  He's just because white people are elitist, and they don't think it matters what blacks say  or do.  That's the reality of it. 
[00:27:00]  There you go.  Mike, what were you going to say?  I was going to say, you forgot one thing.  What?  He had a child with a campaign worker a few years ago.  Oh, that's right.  That was another good one.  And now he talks about degradation to women in rap lyrics.  Hey, I wonder if you were having sex behind your ice back.  Was that degrading?  Yeah.  Did you think of her in high esteem while you were doing that, while you were pounding  away there, Jess, with your bug eyes, with your always-look-like-a-fat-person-steps-on-your-feet-eyes?  Looks like someone's jumping up and down on his belly all the time.  He always looks like a forklift and just backed over his arches. 
[00:27:30]  Stupid ass he is.  Looks like the guy that was getting hit by Rodney Dangerfield's boat in Caddyshack.  Hey, speaking of Jesse Jackson, this is a very easy segue, but The View, they went at  it yesterday.  They certainly did.  They had Whoopi giving Elizabeth Hasselbeck or Backer, Beck, or whatever the hell.  Whatever.  A talking to about the N-word.  Oh, that's good.  A talking to. 
[00:28:00]  Good for Whoopi.  She should give her the same speech she gave Ted.  Oh, that's right.  She enjoyed it then.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  When he was in blackface.  We've been down that road with her, certainly.  But it's funny because Elizabeth was arguing, arguing, arguing, arguing, and like Anthony  pointed out in the office as we're watching this clip, runs out of steam, so she starts  crying.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  She got so just owned by Whoopi that she's trying to make a point, and you can see her 
[00:28:30]  mind just completely goes blank.  She's got her hands up in the air.  She doesn't know what to say, so she just bursts into tears like she was pulled over  and crying is going to get her out of a ticket.  And she wants to be very political.  She's a Republican and all that.  She's friends with Sean Hannity.  Can you imagine Sean Hannity running out of steam and just starts crying?  I remember when he did that.  Yeah.  Very embarrassing.  But isn't it amazing?  That's the conservative voice they give on that stupid show.  Oh, I know. 
[00:29:00]  Is this dumb blonde.  They don't put Ann Coulter on, who would, whether you like her or hate her guts.  She would hang in there.  She would run.  And she would not be crying.  Circles around.  Jimmy Norton's personal friend, by the way.  Yeah, of course.  Ann Coulter.  Yes.  I know.  I know you did.  Who are you?  Oh, God.  That's right.  Nancy Regan.  Oh, I call her Laura Ingraham.  I know.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  Whoopi Holberg is insane.  We were watching a interview the other day.  She says, you can't talk.  You can't make jokes about Obama yet.  But she said, I'm the first one to ever do one about Obama. 
[00:29:30]  Whoopi's out of her complete mind.  Yeah.  If you watch the show, it's just ridiculous.  I was torn because I don't really agree with what Whoopi was saying about the N-word yesterday.  But it was so good to see Elizabeth just getting smashed.  She's terrible.  But they pick a purposely dumb person to represent that.  That's a very good point.  She puts on this phony, idealistic crap that she's trying to put out there to Whoopi that  everyone's got to get together and we can't ban this word.  She really was just a blithering idiot. 
[00:30:00]  Instead of just saying, hey, the outrage in the black community has been phony with this  stuff lately, the NAACP was phony when they buried the word and they don't condemn him.  It's fraudulent.  Instead of calling her out accurately, she's just a dummy.  Yeah.  Well, we got a couple of clips from The View yesterday.  I believe this went down.  A picture of Jimmy and Ann Coulter.  Here's Whoopi explaining why black people are living in a different world than white people.  My thing is that we don't live in different worlds.  We live in the same world. 
[00:30:30]  It starts with Elizabeth, obviously.  It's being literal.  We breathe the same air.  Believe me, I've seen black noses.  They do the same thing, but we get it.  They get more, though, through their noses.  My thing is that we don't live in different worlds.  That was a joke by Rich Voss.  I don't feel like getting fired today.  I think that's a good joke at that, but you're just trying to have fun.  I was talking about white people.  Rich Voss.  These dopey bloggers are listening all the time trying to get us in trouble.  So every time something is a little edgy and outrageous, we're going to just jump on  it and acknowledge it.  And sell out whoever said it.  Yeah, exactly.  Acknowledge that. 
[00:31:00]  We're just trying to make jokes today.  Oh, sorry.  Breitbart and the rest of them.  Go screw it.  Breitbart.  My thing is that we don't live in different worlds.  We live in the same world.  We do live in different worlds.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's the way it is, Elizabeth.  This is the way it is.  This is how I grew up.  My mother could not go and vote in the United States of America, the place of her birth.  Do you see what I mean?  This was the point that I mentioned yesterday.  We're not far enough removed.  Because that's how black people look at it. 
[00:31:30]  It's too close.  When you have your mother or even you couldn't vote in a country that you joined the military.  But the point I was making is it is close.  You do vividly remember certain things.  But on the other hand, you can then see firsthand how things have changed and how much better they've gotten.  So, you know, you could take that both ways.  Yeah.  Well, my grandmother couldn't eat corn after the SS took her teeth out of her mouth.  Okay.  That's true, but I'll say this too.  A little reference? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Well, where else would he assess it?  I don't know.  Social Security.  Maybe she was old and annoying, so they just yanked her teeth.  Couldn't call and complain anymore.  Thank you.  It's cold in that office.  Back to Whoopi.  America, the place of her birth.  We go every...  Wait, wait.  Yes, we would like to.  But you don't understand.  No, no, no.  I want you to.  But what I need you to understand is the frustration that goes along.  When you say we live in the same world, it isn't balanced, and we would like it to be, 
[00:32:30]  but you have to understand, you have to listen to the fact that we're telling you there are issues,  there are huge problems that still affect us.  Fair enough.  Fair enough, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't quite agree with it, but it's her point of view.  What am I going to do?  And then Elizabeth, it's Elizabeth's turn.  There she goes.  Watch what happens.  Point counter douche.  And you've got to know this if you want to know us.  I understand that.  I'm not trying to sound like it.  I am not trying to take that away from you. 
[00:33:00]  When we are living in this world, and we are living in a world where there is, in the pop culture,  when that world is unused, when there are...  This is upsetting to me, because...  Ah!  So...  I am.  Ah!  So, you heard her.  She just fell apart.  She couldn't get her thought together and get it out, so she threw her hands up and started  crying.  That is perfect.  That's the weapon that all women have, by the way.  That's the weapon.  You're like, oh, now you're going to cry.  She's going to cry. 
[00:33:30]  You're right.  I'm wrong.  She's on a show.  She got owned by Whoopi.  She's trying to make a point.  It fell apart.  So what do you do?  Start weeping.  Boy, you're really empowering women with that frigging...  Wah, wah, wah.  Instead of acknowledging that Whoopi did raise a good point, that's an accurate point, but  if that's the point, then just admit that the double standard, you're comfortable with  that, and stop acting like you don't notice it.  Right.  And stop acting like you don't want it.  Yeah.  Just stop it.  Stop acting like you don't, on some level, enjoy the victim status in a moment like this 
[00:34:00]  when it pays off and a guy like Jesse isn't called out the way white people would be.  The victim status years ago wasn't good, because you were truly a victim of violence,  violence of, I don't know, you couldn't use the bathrooms, you couldn't go into certain  places to eat, couldn't vote, but now, the opportunity's there for everybody to use  the system to the best of their advantage.  Some people get lucky, some people don't, some people work hard, they make it, some people 
[00:34:30]  work hard and don't.  It's just the way it is.  But the opportunity's there.  No one's holding anyone back.  And Jim's right that it's a great time to be a black person in this country, because  you really do, there is a double standard in place where you're not called out on anything.  At least language-wise, only in language.  Language, I'll say that.  You're right there, but see, I'm not a bleeding heart, and the opportunity is out there for  everybody, but it is tougher in the inner city when you can't go to a library as a kid, 
[00:35:00]  there's no books, there's nowhere, your school, well, your schools don't have the computers  and don't have the technology like the schools in the suburbs, so the opportunity isn't equal  that's out there.  And I, you know, I'm saying if you really want something, you go out and get it, but  you can't do that as a seven-year-old or as a ten-year-old, okay?  So you go to these schools in Harlem or go to a school in Westfield, New Jersey, it's a  big difference, a teaching and-  Yeah, and so are the taxes and everything else, it's, you know, you get what you pay 
[00:35:30]  for.  All right, let's say hi to James in New Hampshire.  It's true, it's just the way it is.  James in New Hampshire, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  I just wanted to point out how gay the view is, because their conservative point of view  is the equivalent of a high school cheerleader against two, whether it's Whoopi or Rosie,  as much as I hate them both, they're brilliant comedians, and they put crying high school  cheerleader against them.  They are funny, but they're funny comics, and I'll say one thing for Whoopi and Rosie  is they're both good talkers, and they're both kind of alpha male women in the sense 
[00:36:00]  that they'll go after you, and that they'll kind of, they're good at making their point.  Neither one of them are stupid, so what they do is, you're right, they put the equivalent  of a high school cheerleader up against them, and that's how they represent.  So the conservative just looks like a dumb, out-of-touch, suburban crybaby bimbo.  But she's easier to look at than the other ones on the show.  I'll say she is.  You know what, though?  Easy on the eyes.  But I'm glad it's like this, because, you know, then you got Hannity and Combs, and  Hannity is that strong Republican personality, and then you got Combs. 
[00:36:30]  So there's a bit of a balance, but I love the fact that Elizabeth just gets beat up on  this show on a daily basis when they get into these heavy issues.  And she does look like a dumb, blonde cheerleader.  She's a dummy.  She's stupid.  She's not, she really, it's almost like Daddy is back there, or some man that she's seeking  the approval of, and she's trying to constantly appease them.  You can almost emotionally feel her looking over her shoulder, begging for that nod from  some male figure.  Yeah, my girl hates.  You know that feeling, don't you? 
[00:37:00]  You bet I do.  My girl hates that this broad is representing her generation.  She's obsessed with hating Elizabeth.  Is there more of her weeping there?  In the world where there is, in the pop culture, when that world is in use, when they're,  when they're, this is upsetting to me, because, okay, just take a breath.  I am, but this is a conversation that is hard, and we're going to have it here, and we have  it here well, because we love each other. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, the studio audience really enjoyed that one.  Boo!  Thank you.  Can you imagine crying over an issue?  I know.  How do you try watching the footage on a TV show like that?  There's no crying and debating.  Stop whining.  What are you doing?  Stop whining.  Well, who is your daddy?  Stop whining.  My daughter was seven.  She got her hand caught in her sliding door, and I laughed.  Who's crying? 
[00:38:00]  Who's she?  You can't cry during a debate.  A debate.  Can you imagine Ann Coulter crying like that?  Oh, she would have smashed Whoopi.  Or at least hit her back with an equally valid point.  Yeah, with some kind of point.  She would have hung in there.  Absolutely.  All right, it continued.  Then Elizabeth tries to make her point.  Oh, what a dope this one is.  When we live in a world where pop culture then uses that term, and we're trying to get to  a place where we feel like we're in the same place, and we feel like we're in the same  world, how are we supposed to then move forward if we keep using terms that bring back that 
[00:38:30]  pain?  I can tell you.  Shut up.  Phony bitches.  You friggin', yeah.  That's how phony white people do.  Phony, phony, little white bitch.  We need to throw this one back and have her eat bugs again.  She's not ready for the big time.  Get her back in the jungle eating bugs and crap.  We didn't use that term recently in the news.  Jesse Jackson did.  We didn't just get caught.  Yeah.  Allah. 
[00:39:00]  We can do it if we keep using terms that bring back that pain.  I can tell you.  Wow.  Here's how we do it.  You listen and say, okay, this is how we're using this word, and this is why we do it.  You have to say, well, you know what?  I understand that, but let's find a new way to move forward.  You must acknowledge the understanding of what it is and why it is.  Can I be in order to...  Babble, babble, babble, babble, psycho, babble, babble, babble.  Yeah.  How about the Trent Lott example you gave for I Miss Whoopi?  Come on. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Come on.  Oh, just a double standard.  Phony.  Just admit it.  Just admit it's there.  Just say, yeah, we can, you can't.  That's what it is.  I don't even care about using, Chris Rock had a great joke about, he goes, yeah, I can  say that word and you can't.  He goes, that's the one advantage to being black.  I'll trade with you.  You run outside and yell, N all day, and I'll change the interest rates.  That is good.  He really put it into perspective. 
[00:40:00]  That is good.  He's definitely brilliant.  This is what Al Sharpton had to say about Jesse Jackson using the N-word.  That was mysteriously leaked out, by the way.  This Fox is a, the Fox News, a bunch of phonies.  They had the clip, but for some reason they decided not to play it.  I think the higher up said, we can't play this.  So what did they do?  They mysteriously leaked it to the rest of the media.  That clip couldn't drip out.  It's really sickening the way they, I would love to know how they handle it like that.  Wow, that's great. 
[00:40:30]  Here we go.  This is what Al Sharpton has to say.  Your reaction to this revelation about the things Jesse Jackson had to say off camera  during this interview on Fox?  Well, I'm very disappointed.  I think that this certainly does not reflect the Reverend Jackson that we all know and love.  It does.  Yes, it does, stupid.  It was a private moment.  It was one of the most candid moments there is.  That is the reflection of him. 
[00:41:00]  Nothing reflects a person better than catching them in a private moment, you fatso.  That's the honesty.  Not the bull crap he's babbling out on a daily basis.  Cue up the Reverend Al song.  We're going to need it today.  Oh, yeah.  That one's always a winner.  This does reflect Jesse.  It perfectly reflects him.  It doesn't reflect him as the one we know and love because he wasn't trashing Jews.  You're right.  Good point.  Oh, God.  Hypocrisy everywhere.  Oh, what a love.  It's phony.  He has said that he apologized to Senator Obama. 
[00:41:30]  I've not heard any statement on this last revelation.  I think that we have to be consistent.  We have denounced the N-word and National Action Network and other groups.  Those of us, and many of us have used it privately, said we must refrain from it if we're going  to challenge you to give you it publicly.  You must be consistent, and I think this is very disappointing.  That's all it is.  Disappointing.  Not one threatening tone.  Right.  Not one ounce of anger.  This outrage when it comes to at least black people that the media chooses to cover is fraudulent. 
[00:42:00]  And you were disappointed with Imus, but it didn't stop there.  Now, did it, Reverend Al?  And that was anger.  That was motivating action.  Oh, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  Why don't you call for Jesse Jackson to step down?  Why aren't you calling him to step down as the head of the Rainbow Push Coalition?  Yeah.  The extortion commission.  The commission that sends people to job sites and protests until they hire more black people.  Why not ask for him to step down the same way you would other people? 
[00:42:30]  He wants to cut the testicles off, the first black candidate in history, and he's dropping  an N-bomb in private to another black guy.  So where is the consistency?  Chuck Nice.  What's he doing?  What?  Chuck Nice is on.  Oh, that's Godfrey.  Yeah.  Godfrey's a funny dude, man.  Is that Linda Smith, too, in the middle?  They're talking about the Emmys.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Well, let me talk on the CW.  You know Godfrey.  Let's say hi to Luke in Buffalo, listening on the edge.  Luke, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Yeah, I know she's really annoying, but does anyone else in there find her absolutely adorable? 
[00:43:00]  I just want to keep her alive, Elizabeth.  She's a looker, for sure, but what comes out of her mouth just makes her uglier and uglier.  She's sitting next to a bunch of ladies that look like they looked into the ark.  I mean, their faces are melting and stuff.  It's easy to look like a ten if you're hanging out with threes.  Oof.  The bar makes really cute noises in bed, too, you know?  Like crying?  That's what I like to do. 
[00:43:30]  Let's hear her with a friggin' face buried in a pillow crying.  Our buddy Malik's getting a lot of air time lately.  It certainly is.  From Asbury Park.  Malik, what do you got today?  Yeah, yeah.  What up?  Hey, man.  Hey, yo, listen.  I just want to let all the white Americans know, man.  Plain and simple.  Uh-oh.  Here comes the war.  The war is like this.  It's like being in a fraternity.  We can use it, but you can't.  And if you do use it, then you've got to suffer the ramifications of it.  Plain and simple.  See, that's the problem I have. 
[00:44:00]  Malik, I don't mind people disliking or even complaining when a white guy uses it.  That's fine.  Fair enough.  But when it's costing people their jobs because of what I consider a manufactured outrage,  and then this happens, and there's none of that outrage, to me it's disgusting and it's  phony.  That's the problem I have with it.  I know that white people don't have the right to use it.  Black people do.  Fine.  But it costs people their jobs.  And no matter what color you are, no one wants to hear that you can't do something,  but we can.  That just infuriates the people that can't do something.  Malik, let me get this in before your phone card runs out. 
[00:44:30]  And then you've got nothing to get in.  You just wanted to use that line.  So bad.  All right, Malik, it's a shorty today because we've got to move on with Jim Norton's birthday.  All right?  Did he go yet?  He's right here.  Malik, before you go.  What?  You've got to admit, just before you go, Sharpton's little speech about how he's disappointed,  it's just, come on, man.  It's inconsistent and it's phony.  Well, everything that Sharpton does is inconsistent.  I mean, like I said, he's not a black leader. 
[00:45:00]  Nobody that I run with supports him or agrees with him.  He backbites him.  But he is.  Regardless, he is.  He has influence over a lot of people's jobs, their livelihoods.  I hear that a lot from black people that he's not our leader, but he's on TV every single time there's a black issue.  Who's your leader then?  White people give him that power.  But black people probably, in a way, never condemn him.  You never hear black people condemning him. 
[00:45:30]  Never.  But they don't usually condemn anybody.  When do you ever hear a black person condemning another black?  Unless they're like a Republican.  Okay?  White people give Sharpton's power.  If white people say, you know what?  Beat it.  You have no power here.  Who's going to say anything?  Blacks aren't going to stand up for him.  And he's going to have nowhere to go or run to.  You know, Rich Hasselbeck makes a good point.  I'm a little confused by Rich Hasselbeck.  It seems like your brain cells regenerated overnight or something. 
[00:46:00]  A little smarter than usual.  I'll bring it back down, though.  So, Malik, that's the problem I have.  It's the phony outrage.  Not that you should be able to yell it in the middle of 145th Street and not get your teeth knocked out with a tire iron.  That'll happen.  It's the phony anger around it.  Yeah, we're smart.  We know when and when not to use that word.  Sure.  We're not stupid.  What do you mean?  I wouldn't tell nobody not to use it.  I mean, you could go ahead.  If you're white and you want to use it, go ahead and use it.  But, because you've got the freedom of speech.  But, you've also got to expect. 
[00:46:30]  Consequences.  I understand that.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  When it comes to consequences at work or with stuff like this, that's where it should be the same.  On the street, if you want to yell that at a guy and get your jaw broken, that's your priority.  It is America.  God bless you.  You can use your free speech and a guy can break your jaw.  But, when you're doing it in humor and getting fired, and Jesse Jackson is mumbling it right after talking about cutting the testicles off the first black candidate, and no one asks for you to step down, it's because blacks are still being looked at like second class citizens, whether you realize that or not, by elites white people. 
[00:47:00]  And, I think the black community should rise up and say, look, this Jesse Jackson, you know, they've got to start publicly saying he doesn't represent us.  Because, I'm sick of hearing it in private.  Oh, Reverend Al, Jesse, they don't represent us.  Well, I think the reason why we don't do it.  Well, start yelling and screaming it, because, you know, white America thinks Jesse and Reverend Al are representing the black community.  That's for sure.  Well, I think the reason why we don't do it is because, right now, they are the only voice of the black community.  There is no other voice but them.  So, I think they've been in the spotlight for so long that they've just been a representation of the black community. 
[00:47:30]  No, but you guys won't give anybody a chance.  You wouldn't let somebody like Condoleezza Rice be the voice or Colin Powell because they're Republicans.  Shut up.  Condoleezza Rice?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Like, she's black, and you don't think that she leans towards black people or black issues, but no one will give her that chance because she's not a Democrat.  If she was a Democrat, you'd be all over Condoleezza Rice.  So, don't give me that.  Why not Condoleezza Rice?  I mean, she's obviously a really smart woman.  She was Secretary of State.  I mean, she's not a dummy. 
[00:48:00]  She's a very powerful – she's one of the most powerful people in our country.  Why not her?  I mean, as far as her intelligence and as far as her success, yeah, she's a good role model for the black community.  But as far as what she did in the administration she's worked for, nah.  What has she done, though?  What has she done that's so anti-black or that black people wouldn't be – and even more than any politician who just does things that lean against conservative or liberal ideology.  What has she done that's so bad?  Okay, well, Jim, to counter-answer your question, what has she done for the black community? 
[00:48:30]  I don't hear her in –  She's Secretary of State.  She's representing the country.  Yes.  She's representing – she's one of the most recognizable representatives of our country.  So, what has she done for black people?  Gee, I don't know.  Do you not see that as being an amazing place to be?  The problem is she's female.  And – oh, yeah, by the way, excellent point, Mike.  Thank you.  Of course, Mike knows that we don't – she's fourth in line for presidential succession.  So, I guess it would be Bush, Cheney, Speaker of the House, and then Secretary of State, right?  Yep.  The problem is she's a female, though. 
[00:49:00]  A lot of us, you know, we have female bosses.  It sucks.  They are irritating.  To give them that much power.  It's like, eh.  We've never seen her with a guy.  This is weird.  But why is she not?  She's done nothing.  We've never seen Fargo, fellas.  All right.  Well, I just picked up the 40-cal Desi E, so, you know what I'm saying?  Oh.  Oh, love.  Why didn't you go with the 50?  Nah, I didn't have enough money to get it, but I'm 40.  We could have threw you a few.  I look forward to seeing Malik with that on, I guess, 7-Eleven video.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  Thank you, Malik.  All right.  See you at the virus show, fellas.  Paula, August 2nd, PNC Bank Art Center.  All the comedians you know and love from this show.  Tickets through Ticketmaster.com.  Come on, people.  Get your tickets.  Rich Voss is going to be there.  Louis C.K. is going to be joining the show for Jimmy's birthday after the break.  Yes.  Yes.  And we go to break with this, the Reverend Al song.  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in the cool close land? 
[00:50:00]  Yelling and screaming as he's speaking to a mob.  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  Well, he's staffing off the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  He's got a fat belly and his hair's full of grease.  We hear his battle cry.  No justice, no peace. 
[00:50:30]  The man with a plan who you know you can trust.  The portly little reverend with an ass that's like a bus.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now why is the white man always picking on me?  Remember Bertie Getz in the brawly case.  Turn on the TV. 
[00:51:00]  You would always see his face.  He's speeding in his limo to another homicide.  To make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  On a never-ending search for some good publicity.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's coming proud. 
[00:51:30]  I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge a fee.  Now as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm your pal.  He's your pal.  That's right.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's a raised-faced white hate.  Bad to follow me.  Now why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  Yeah, I'm out.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's your pal. 
[00:52:00]  I'm your pal.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  It's Jimmy Day.  A celebration honoring one of the world's most attractive.  My mule looks fantastic.  Thoughtful.  You have the timing of a stroke on Christmas Eve.  Insightful.  Whatever.  I'm just a zeltzer.  I know it.  All inspiring people.  I hope the last thing you hear before you drunk drive into a wall is my stupid voice.  Jim Norton.  Just shut up.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:52:30]  Bad boy radio host.  Opie and Anthony.  Great Jim Norton's birthday.  It's my birthday.  Happy birthday.  This is ridiculous.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  From all of us at the Opie and Anthony Show.  You heard it too, huh, Jimmy?  The celebrity birthday where she's really dropped off.  Right.  We went from Ozzy to Steve.  Ozzy to Steve.  From all of us.  From all of us here at the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:53:00]  Happy birthday.  Where's Jimmy Norton?  Happy birthday.  Wow.  That's terrific.  I got a story about Norton, how funny he is.  Like, it's not as...  Everybody wants to hear sex stories, but when we were at Woodstock 94, there was a bunch  of comics.  And there was all these outhouses.  So all the people were getting off the bus, and we had stew.  Stew for dinner that night.  And Jimmy takes a plate of stew, and he has half a foot in the outhouse and half out as 
[00:53:30]  he's eating his stew going, this stuff isn't that bad.  And Michael DeMestor was a comedian at the time.  He was staying there with his pants down and his ass.  Oh, God.  And I was eating stew.  And it was stupid hippie girls.  That is so disgusting.  Yeah, it actually worked, though.  It was cheesy in the sound.  It actually worked.  It was so funny.  Nobody thought stew.  There's a photo of me doing that.  I'll bring it in.  It'll be a big lark for all of us.  Hey, Rich Voss in the studio.  Let me give Rich the big plug.  Tomorrow night, Rich, Trump Marina in Atlantic City? 
[00:54:00]  Yes.  All right, TrumpMarina.com for tickets.  There you go.  And we got Louis C.K. joining the program.  I was just talking to Louis in the office.  He warmed up for Ricky Gervais last week, I guess that was.  Monday, yeah.  At the Wamuu Theater here in New York City.  Wow.  F and Louis just killed.  Oh, thank you, man.  You were getting massive laughs throughout the theater.  I hadn't opened for somebody cold for a long time.  I hadn't done that for years.  People are actually still getting beer and still sitting down.  Oh, right, yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Which is weird.  But they focused pretty quickly.  It was good.  And I love the behind-the-scenes stuff.  Louis goes, I got to the theater 30 seconds before I went on stage.  Yeah, I had my kids over, and I had a babysitter, but she can't get him to sleep until like 10 o'clock.  I get him to sleep at 7.  So I was trying to put my kid to sleep, and she's crying.  Hey, I miss mommy.  You know, all this crap.  And the babysitter was there, and I'm trying to get her to go to sleep.  And then the guy, I thought the show was 8. 
[00:55:00]  The guy called me at 7.10 and said, we're getting a little nervous because the show's in 20 minutes.  Oh, wow.  So I told my daughter, sorry, you just forget it.  And she was crying as I ran out the door.  And I ran to get a cab.  I couldn't get a cab.  Got to the theater and literally went like from her bed to the stage just out of breath and going, oh, yeah, 50, 500 people.  Madison Square Garden Theater.  Biggest crowd I've ever played for in my life.  And you're late.  I mean, no, actually, that's not true.  On the virus tour, I played bigger crowds. 
[00:55:30]  You better give us props for that there later.  Are you talking more than that?  Yeah, no, about 12,000 in Jersey.  It was 12,000 last year.  Easy.  Easy, yeah.  And we're doing it again August 2nd.  About eight beach balls, too.  Yeah, I know.  That's a little distracting when they're punching beach balls around as you're trying to tell jokes.  They are beach balls.  Oh!  So how would he have you open?  Who would want to follow you?  I mean, just like such a killer.  Oh, thank you, Rich.  Well, I made a movie with Ricky, and he asked me if I wanted to do it. 
[00:56:00]  And I only did 10 minutes.  I think originally he had me doing 25, but 10 minutes, you know, you can follow anybody  doing 10 minutes.  It's funny, because Ricky actually, I thought it was cool, gave him an intro from backstage.  Yeah.  And he goes, this guy's my favorite comedian right now working on the circuit.  Yeah.  And I'm just going to come out and do like a 10-minute set for you.  I like the fact that he might have been worried going on.  He's funny.  But, you know, I mean, you're like a real headliner.  He might have been a little nervous going on after 25 minutes.  You're nonsense.  Well, yeah, I was, I mean, I'm not, not to, even just dynamic-wise, I'm a pretty, I go 
[00:56:30]  and get the, I'm dirty, and I curse, and I'm pretty desperate trying to kill every second  guy.  And he sort of tells long stories.  Yeah.  So when he asked me, I actually said, you know, it might not be a good idea.  And he said, no, I love it.  So I'm incredible.  And Louis C.K., obviously, he's a headliner, and they had you perform in front of the curtain,  like you had four feet of stage.  Oh, yeah, it was humbling, so I don't think Ricky Gervais was nervous, because he knew  that that curtain was going to open, and it was just going to be like... 
[00:57:00]  And Kong would be behind it.  Basically, that's what it was.  Ladies and gentlemen, Kong!  You had Louis just with a curtain, and then the curtain opens, and there's 10-foot letters  that spell out Ricky, and fireworks, and a light show.  Oh, he comes out in, like, a king outfit.  King rope with his crown.  Sure.  Yeah, no, and it's been years since I've been in that situation of, like, the guy with the  headsets right before I go on, go, take the mic stand with you when you leave.  Yeah, like, yelling at you. 
[00:57:30]  Meanly.  Yeah.  They're always mean.  Yeah.  Don't step on that.  Don't touch the mic stand.  Don't touch the mic.  Yeah.  Just go out there, say it, get off.  Don't step on that.  All right.  Yes.  Shut up, you're a roadie.  No, they treated me like I was making the exit announcements for safety before the show.  Yeah, yeah.  But I didn't have, I wasn't billed like I agreed to do.  I didn't get paid for it.  I just did it as a favor to him.  Yeah, yeah.  And they didn't bill me or anything.  They already sold out the show, so it didn't matter.  We had to go out before STP recently, and these douches give us microphones that are 
[00:58:00]  used for the background vocals, and we're supposed to talk to the crowd with these background  vocal microphones.  So no one's hearing us or nothing.  Buried in echo.  We're just, yeah, completely buried.  It's like, thanks.  You couldn't give us the real mic for 30 seconds.  I remember playing in bands where you'd open for another band that would have this huge  stage show, and you'd have to set up the drums and all the amps on, yeah, three feet 
[00:58:30]  of the front of the stage.  Right.  Because God forbid you over show them or something.  It's just so annoying.  No.  It's awful.  Come on.  Club Soda Cannon, yes.  Can I tell a cute little story that's kind of related in honor of Jim's birthday?  Sure.  When I used to work for another comedian, Jim's first show.  Yeah, huh?  You could say Dice, my God.  I know.  You're so fresh.  You were like the other network.  It was, you know, it was like a big gig from, I think it was like a 3,000 seat theater. 
[00:59:00]  Houston.  Yeah.  And I used to set up the stool for Dice with like towels and water and everything like  an ashtray, cigarettes, like perfectly.  And I told Jim, you're going to go out there with the water?  Yeah.  He's going out with the water.  I go, don't put your water on the stool.  And if you forget your water on stage, on the stool, when you come off stage, just keep  walking.  And that's what he heard.  That was his little pep talk before he went out like to do a big show. 
[00:59:30]  Nice.  I'm so glad Jimmy has become a big star and now can get, you know, get you back for all  that crap you put him through back in the day.  He does everything for me.  If he dies, I'm finished.  Why would it be a problem if little Jimmy put his water bottle on a stool?  No, I was beholden to a certain guy.  Now I'm beholden to Jimmy.  I'd sit on the water bottle.  It would hurt.  They said in Nuremberg, Kenny. 
[01:00:00]  We got a special guest calling the Opie and Anthony show for Jim Norton's birthday.  I wonder who this could be.  I have no idea who this is.  Hello.  Happy birthday, Jim Norton.  Oh, I know who that is.  This is Jim Florentine.  Is that Florentine?  Yeah.  It's Mr. Quivers.  Oh, hey, what's up, Florentine?  How you doing, man?  Who would have thought Jim Norton would have lasted to 40 years old?  I know.  It's really depressing, man.  I remember your 40th.  We were at that.  You had Sabra Kadabra playing at your 40th birthday party at an Elks Lodge in Jersey. 
[01:00:30]  It was great, man.  Yeah, pure white trash.  And Voss booked us there.  What?  Oh, yeah.  I did?  Rich Voss there?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What's going on?  Hey, one thing about Rich, man.  He was the one who helped me and Jim out in the beginning, man.  Coming into New York City and stuff with gigs because they wanted nothing to do with us in New York.  I know.  We were just such...  That's right.  We came in from Jersey and I was here first, but we were such pigs. 
[01:01:00]  We were taking like the club bookers and all the waitresses in the back rooms and we were taking everybody's spots and stuff.  But how funny is, dude, everywhere you'd go, there was a bad report about Voss.  It was never...  Oh, God.  He was terrific last week.  It was...  Are you friends with him?  Always.  Yeah, I go into a club.  They're like, yeah, some asshole was...  Some jerk was here last week and, you know, you can't do this, you can't do that.  I'm like, who was the comic?  Like, I don't want to say.  I'm like, was it Rich Voss?  Like, how'd you know? 
[01:01:30]  I'm rich.  Douche.  He really is a tool.  How was Afghanistan, man?  You just went over, right?  Yeah, it was great, man.  We had a blast over there.  We actually got...  The base we did a show, I got mortar fired like 20 minutes after the show.  We had to go hiding them.  We had to go hide in a bunker for an hour.  That's how they applaud over there.  Yeah.  Lob mortars into...  I forget that Afghanistan has stuff going...  Because the tell was here.  That's right.  I forgot you were there with Dave.  I forgot Afghanistan has, like, a lot of heat going on.  It's not just Iraq. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  It's got more fatalities now, right?  I think.  More people are dying in Afghanistan than Iraq.  Yeah, it's a hot spot.  That's stupid Taliban.  We had a little comeback.  That's right.  They're number one now.  Yeah, the month of June.  The month of June was the first month that there was more deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq,  and that's the month we could go to pick over there.  You know what I mean?  I know.  You should have just went to a base in Germany or Japan.  Had a nice, easy time.  You know, maybe a horde after or something.  Yeah, that would have been nice.  You know what I mean?  But, yeah, it was crazy, man. 
[01:02:30]  But it was great, man.  It was better than, you know, doing a firehouse in Jersey like we did for years.  How many comics were there?  Like, four or five of you guys?  Yeah, it was me, David Tell, Nick DiPaolo, and Artie Lang.  Good show.  Strong lineup, man.  Jim, I forgot to ask you, too.  I'm glad you're on the phone.  August 9th.  We do our show August 2nd.  August 9th.  Are you going to see Motorhead and Heaven and Hell and Priest?  I'm trying to.  I got a gig at the Stress Factor that weekend, but I'm trying to get go there.  Yeah.  You got to come to the... 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, come on.  Tell Vinny to just, you know...  Yeah, you got to go see Motorhead, right?  What are you going to do?  You know, go see Motorhead or pull in 20 grand?  Hey, Florentine, you got a story about Jimmy for his birthday?  20 grand?  I'm kidding.  I know.  Yeah, Jim, like, when Jim first started, I don't know if he still does this.  Like, if we had a gig like four or five towns over, and it's in the wintertime, he would  call, like, the local police department because he was worried if the roads were icy.  So he'd be calling.  He goes, look, I'm a comic. 
[01:03:30]  I'm doing a show.  And they're like, we're busy here.  What?  He's like, you know, are the roads icy?  Is it over 32 degrees?  I did call about black ice.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  No, you didn't.  The guy was with a hooker, you know, for like seven bucks and three cigarettes like an  hour before that, and the guy's worried about black ice.  I totally forgot about that.  I had a Mustang at the time, which was rear-wheel drive, and I did call the police department  to ask, like, how's your road condition?  Oh, they must have been like, what?  Shut up. 
[01:04:00]  Just drive.  We used to do gigs.  Like, we go to Connecticut.  He would only put, like, seven bucks in his car at a time and gas.  Why?  I don't know.  We'd stop every frigging hour.  It's like, I got to pee, and I got to get gassed again.  I'm like, just frigging fill the damn tank up.  Jimmy.  Was it you or Norton that put all that stuff on the ticket at the toll booth?  Oh, boogers?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's warranty.  Yeah, me and my buddy went from, like, exit one to 16, and we just picked our nose the 
[01:04:30]  whole way and put boogers all over the back of the toll ticket.  And I went to hand it to the guy, and the guy jumped back, like, what is on that ticket?  I'm like, I don't know.  I was eating a sandwich before.  Jesus.  Oh, that's terrible.  And one of my favorite quarantine things, and you haven't, Jimmy, I've been on in a  while, the stopping to ask at the toll booths if they have coffee or if they're doing anything  for tired motorists.  Right.  Well, one time I got this black lady at the Lincoln Tunnel. 
[01:05:00]  I go, yeah, I'm on the list.  He's like, what are you saying?  I'm on the list.  My friend, he works for the Port Authority, said, I'm on the list.  He's like, you ain't on the list.  I'm like, no.  Did you just check?  That's the list.  And you check.  Oh, that is great.  We used to go to those booths in Philly, outside of Philly, where we pay girls just to watch  us do things.  Did you go with me and Florentine? 
[01:05:30]  It was me, you, and Florentine one night.  And Levy, yeah.  And Levy.  And we were, you weren't there.  Well, you go into the booth and you, this was years ago, and you do things, and Florentine's  in the booth, and all of a sudden you hear, mop.  Mop to booth, too.  Mop.  It was really bad in there, because there was a lot of people in there before me.  One time I had a, I was in there for so long, I just left my sneakers in there. 
[01:06:00]  Because I was stuck.  You need a whole mop?  A mop in a bucket?  A little tissue is usually okay for me.  Yeah, one time, like, the bell went off.  I thought I won a prize.  Like, mop, the guy's running over.  I remember, with Florentine, I've had the best gasser stories.  How great was it, me and Jim, we both upgraded to first.  Where were we going to L.A. when I had just those patroned gassers for the entire flight?  Yeah, it was brutal.  Yeah, the witches, the stewardess wouldn't even come by. 
[01:06:30]  They're using their spray.  You know, we're the only two dirtbags in first class.  Everybody's in business suits and wearing, like, shorts and black Sabbath t-shirts.  But it was just like, I was dropping so many gassers, and Jim had walked into the bathroom  just so he washed his hands.  They thought it was him.  Oh, perfect.  So they're actually spritzing outside the bathroom door.  And the one lady walked through and actually stopped and then spritzed in the aisle where  we were sitting because she, like, knew something was going on because we were just holding  the newspapers and shaking and laughing behind the newspaper.  Two adults just farting and laughing. 
[01:07:00]  Didn't they say they were going to stop to land a plane?  That was Florentine.  Yeah, me and a couple of my buddies were farting.  And one of them was, like, 145 planes were, like, 50 seats.  And it was so bad.  The woman goes, look.  The stewardess comes up.  She goes, look, if you guys do that one more time, we're landing the plane.  Wow.  Wow.  That's got to be a bad part.  Now, that would be a funny story to read in the paper, though, as to why they had to  land the plane.  Sure.  How great would it be if you were on the no-fly list because you were cutting gas?  That would have been a great way to make the news. 
[01:07:30]  Sometimes I come off a plane and handcuffs, like, the guys were passing gas, and they  didn't know what it was, Al-Qaeda.  Dude, I miss seeing you, man.  I really hope you can go see Sabbath.  I've been thinking of you.  I've been meaning to call you.  And Jim, Jim did Down and Dirty.  You were great, dude.  So, you know, I really hope you can go see Sabbath, man.  Absolutely, man.  It's like, you know, me and Jim used to live together, too, for, like, five years, four  or five years.  I lived at home until, Florentine got my first paid gig in comedy, and then, back in  1990, and then I got out of my parents' house when I was 30, and I moved in with Jim. 
[01:08:00]  There was three of us there.  It was me, him, and his girlfriend, Alina, at the time, and $300 apiece.  And we did a Cribs episode with...  That's right.  That was in that...  With your place, with Jim Florentine.  With the mall.  Yeah, that place is awful, but it was, like, five minutes from New York City, so it worked  perfect for us.  But didn't after we moved out, after we eventually, we split up, and Jim and his girl got  a place, and I moved into New York, didn't they make that, like, Section 8 housing?  I don't know.  I didn't hear that, probably.  I heard they were going to Section 8 housing, or the landlord... 
[01:08:30]  What were some of the problems with the place again?  I forgot.  It's been so long.  There was mold, and...  Yeah, it was mold all over the walls.  It was...  I mean, the place is just disgusting.  We had...  What are those bugs we had?  Silverfish?  Silverfish?  We had silverfish.  Silverfish.  Silverfish.  Dude, I counted, like, seven of them on my wall.  What the hell is a silverfish?  Oh, they're those hairy, giant...  Oh, they're the most horrible.  Well, that's really...  Silverfish means your life is horrible.  Yeah.  Yeah, it means you're living in a real crap hole.  They look like a push-me-pull-you bug. 
[01:09:00]  The front looks just like the back.  They got these antennae.  They're silver-colored, and they're almost like an earwig type of bug.  Oh, God.  I was in Norton's place.  It's horrid.  That place, where you lived there, when I was there, it had a smell of urine.  I mean, your chested, or your bedroom.  Well, yeah, whenever mold would just come on the wall, we'd just put, like, an Aussie  poster over, we didn't even care.  He had, at one point, tinfoil on his bedroom walls to cover the mold.  Oh, God.  He said, no Gibson?  He couldn't even get good decorations. 
[01:09:30]  It was just tinfoil.  It was like living in a potato.  Horrible.  We're going to link this video to onaradio.com, but the old Cribs episode we did with Jimmy,  and they just showed a wall that was just completely covered with black mold from your place.  Yeah, walking up those steps.  Oh, my God.  It could kill you.  Hey, Jim, where are you working this weekend?  I'm down in Wildwood, New Jersey, like 40 minutes south of Atlantic City.  What are you doing, Vito's gig?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, Club Casbah, man.  We came up there.  We used to go down there for a week. 
[01:10:00]  I used to do two weeks a year there.  I would get $400 one week, and what was it, $350 the other week?  He'd give you $50 less the second week.  Oh, that's nice.  I'm a big fan of Wildwood.  Yeah, he's the one, the club owner's the one who made Jim wear those weightlifting pants.  He has pictures of those where he used to wear those baggy pants on stage.  Every night he wore those things.  Yeah, the Grimmest Pants.  How did he make you wear pants?  He just got me into it.  He goes, they're so comfortable.  And his name is Mark Vito.  He's a good dude, but he would tell the worst jokes.  The club owner would emcee, and he would just go out and tell awful jokes. 
[01:10:30]  Like anybody from Philly, yeah, a couple of cheesesteakers.  Yeah.  Hey, because those are popular there.  Oh, God.  Get it?  Do you get it?  Hey, Florentine, we got a screen cap of the mold on the wall.  It looks like someone had explosive you-know-what and just hit the wall.  It looks like someone.  And spray paint on the wall.  It looks like, yeah.  Like black paint.  Yeah.  Like spray paint.  It's just amazing.  That is a lot of mold.  Yeah, that's how we lived.  And I was 30 years old, by 31 or 32 by that point. 
[01:11:00]  And I was on the radio, and I had TV credits.  Really?  Yeah.  And you were living in that.  Look at that mold.  Look, and you guys just put some kind of a poster up over the mold.  That could kill you.  I know.  We didn't even think about that.  It probably took like 20 years off our life.  Yeah, we just throw something up.  Yeah.  I go to like a friggin' flea market and buy a picture.  I'm like, God, this will cover this spot.  Cover the mold.  Oh, God.  Yeah, the storage we had in the living room with my chest set.  What a crap hole you guys lived in. 
[01:11:30]  Wow.  I'm stunned.  Yeah, we got to take a break, but we're going to put this video up on onaradio.com.  Oh, yeah, dude, it would leak, too.  The rain would leak.  We had paved-in ceiling tiles.  Oh, the tiles.  Look at the old ceiling tiles are coming down.  All right, dude.  It was good hearing from you, Jim.  I hope to see you soon, man.  Yeah, and the one thing, like me and Jim, like whenever it was our birthday or Christmas,  we never get each other gifts.  You know what I mean?  Like we weren't going to get a stupid sweater.  Instead, what we'd do is we'd leave each other bowel movements in the toilet.  Where was this house on Paper Street? 
[01:12:00]  I'd wake up in the morning all hungover like nine in the morning.  I'd lift a lid, and I'd see like one the size of a yam in there.  A little note, happy birthday.  Oh, yeah, floaters ruled.  Nothing better than a good floater.  Nice.  All right, buddy.  I'll talk to you later, man.  We'll see you soon, man.  All right, man.  Happy birthday.  Thanks, buddy.  Jim Florentine, everyone.  See you, Jim.  Louis C.K. in studio, Rich Voss in studio, Jim Norton's birthday.  We got Basil T's doing the omelette.  Did you get an omelette yet there, Louis?  I did.  It was good. 
[01:12:30]  There you go.  Basil T's, Hooper Avenue, and Tom's River.  We'll continue.  It's Jimmy Day in honor of the happiest boy at school.  Wow.  Die.  Jim Norton.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Happy birthday to you.  It's Jim Norton's birthday.  Oh, it's my birthday.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  I feel like a douche in this hat. 
[01:13:00]  We're back with Jim Norton's birthday here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The excitement is just out of control at this point.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, just amazing.  Steve wishing Jimmy a happy birthday again.  Wow.  Yes.  Rich Voss in studio playing Atlantic City tomorrow night.  Yes.  What is it again?  Trump Marina.  Thank you.  TrumpMarina.com for tickets.  Co-headlining.  Co-headlining with who?  Alonzo Bowden.  Alonzo Bowden.  Oh, from Last Comic Standing.  Yes.  I was just saying that yesterday, I think, I can't watch that show anymore. 
[01:13:30]  It's unwatchable.  It really, really is.  I watched it last night.  There's a funny, there's one or two funny guys on it.  This guy, Sean, something from Canada.  Very funny guy.  I just hate that they have to cast the comedians.  That's what's driving me nuts.  They have to have one of every category for this dumb show.  It's like, just get 15, 20 funny people.  I don't care if it's a prop act or some Asian broad that's going to talk about our Asian family.  Just throw them in there.  But don't calculate, need the gay comedian, need the prop comic, we need the Dane Cook type comic. 
[01:14:00]  It's, it's, ugh.  The worst thing is that when you do shows on the road, people, people come up to you and go, you know, hey, maybe someday you can get on Last Comic Standing.  Like, they really think.  I'm a guy who's just dying to get on that.  The people don't understand that real comedians don't want to be on the show.  No.  Why is that, by the way?  Because, to me, it seems like it would be great exposure, maybe, maybe not for someone like Louis C.K., but other comedians out there. 
[01:14:30]  That's not true, real.  There is a lot of, no, no, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Someone like Louis doesn't have to do it.  No, no, but a young comedian coming up, it's a good thing to do.  But it's also good.  Years ago, I'm not even, I'm not even, like, crashing you.  I'm just saying.  No, but even now.  It's gotten to the point where real comedians do not want to do this show.  You're 100% wrong.  The first year or two, there was a few that said, this could be good for me.  But now, it's like, they're avoiding it at all costs.  Real comedians try out for the show.  They don't use them because they're too good. 
[01:15:00]  No, that's actually true.  There's a lot of really funny comics.  There's a lot of guys that don't make it.  So, the ones that do decide.  And the year before, who I know, where I was like, wow, you're doing it.  And I had, Arge Barker, the guy's really funny.  And he's a huge star in Europe.  He's big.  He sells out.  And he told me he was doing it.  I'm like, really?  And he goes, look, if I get through, it's great exposure.  And I said, you should do it.  And I saw the set.  He came to Caroline's when I was there once.  And he tried out the set.  It was really funny.  And they flushed him out.  He wasn't in it. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  There's great comics that try.  But they don't want it.  They don't want it.  I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  It is a casting thing.  They want good looking.  It's amazing what they look for.  As opposed to just a bunch of comedians who are going to beat each other up.  And just sit around trashing each other.  Yeah.  That's what comics do.  Right.  Like that seller vibe.  Everybody just beating each other up and being scum.  That's what we do.  That's fun.  And you never hear him on the show during interviews trashing the next guy like you say.  It's always, I have to win this.  This is the best thing.  No, it's not a commercial within itself of the show. 
[01:16:00]  Be real.  Hey, who do you grow up listening to?  Who do you like?  But the problem is it's marketed wrong.  Because the viewers think that they're trying to find the funniest person in America.  And there's guys way funnier than the people that are on the show.  That's the point I'm trying to make, I guess.  Well, that's true.  And the viewers are like, wow, these are the top comics.  No, they're not.  It's not even the funniest person in the theater.  Most of them are just coming up guys trying to get exposure.  And the seasoned pros, they're avoiding the show.  Or if they do try out, they're not what they're looking for for the show. 
[01:16:30]  Or whatever.  If that's tomorrow night, you'll be at Trump Marina.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  We got somebody else calling in for Jim Norton's birthday.  Is it a celebrity?  Oh.  So far, star-studded.  Vos, Louis, and Florentine.  Yes.  We basically had any Thursday at the cellar.  Who do we got on the phone?  Hello.  Is little Jimmy there?  Hi.  What's up, Bob?  Hey, this is Bob Levy.  Yes.  Happy birthday, little fella.  Thanks, buddy.  How you doing, man? 
[01:17:00]  Doing pretty good, man.  Wow.  I haven't talked to Bobby in quite a while.  Hey, we talk here and there, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I mean, it's amazing.  I saw Bob, because Bob drinks a lot.  And I love Levy.  Levy was one of the guys that helped me when I was coming up.  And Bobby would always have a guy who was sober drive him.  Because he would go out and drink and want a guy who was sober to drive home.  Smart.  Tremendous amount of...  You must have done the best gigs back then.  I had so many...  How many gigs have we done together, man?  I mean, for years we worked together.  Well, they wouldn't let us in Canada, you remember that night? 
[01:17:30]  Why, they saw your act there, too?  We got...  Oh, boss is there.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Can you tell by the silence after?  Right.  I was wondering what it was.  I thought the phone cut off.  We went to Canada one time, me and Jimmy.  It's like sneaking through Germany.  It's so tough when you don't have working papers.  So we go there, and they go, how long are you here for?  And Jimmy says, two weeks.  And he goes, how much money you got on you? 
[01:18:00]  He goes, $50.  You were here for two weeks, and you got $50?  And they asked me if I ever worked in Canada.  I go, no.  And they go, what about this place?  And I go, oh, that was Canada?  That was his...  Let us in Canada.  So we went to Buffalo and got a hooker and snuck in the next day.  Oh, he's completely right.  We got...  Wow.  Oh, my God, he's right.  We had...  That was his response.  They pulled us into an office.  Yeah.  Because we had $50, and they thought, like, are you emigrating to Canada?  What are you doing?  And they thought they were smuggling something.  So they searched the car.  We're waiting in the office. 
[01:18:30]  And that was Bob's...  Bob's a brilliant impoverter on stage as far.  He's so fast on his feet.  It's amazing.  Much like myself.  Yes.  It's amazing.  A guy can be in a blackout and think as quickly as leave.  He can.  Why $50 to go to Canada?  I had no money back.  That's all his mother gave him.  You guys weren't making a lot of money, but you would think you would save up a little  bit to go to Canada.  No, we didn't get cash that night, dude.  Just get some cash that night.  And Bobby, that was his response.  They go, well, how about...  Because he had gone, like, a week in Canada before.  They're like, I've never been to Canada. 
[01:19:00]  And they're like, well, how about here, here, and here?  And he goes, oh, yeah, that was Canada.  Oh, God.  He forgot he was in another country.  It's the worst lie I've ever heard told.  Well, you got to talk about the hooker in Buffalo.  I mean, so then you go to Buffalo, she couldn't have been a hooker.  Didn't one of us do a guest spot or something at that comics cafe or something like that?  Yeah, at Befgo's Club or something like that.  And then we snuck in the next day like nothing happened again.  Yeah, and we wound up going.  They would have arrested us if they knew we went in.  We actually went in for about two weeks.  But the best story, Jim, that you left out of your book was, remember that big snowstorm 
[01:19:30]  in 94?  I do.  That was 94.  That was 14 years ago?  It was about 14 years ago.  And that was during my first divorce.  I had these two girls.  That's how we find things relieving, the weather conditions or what marriage was on.  We had these two girls.  Let's say they were 18, okay?  The streets are closed.  Nobody's allowed on the road.  The police say anybody on the road will be arrested.  Yeah, it was that bad.  I go, Jim, you got to come over. 
[01:20:00]  I got two girls here.  We can bang them, right?  Three hours later, there's a knock on my door.  Or it's Jim standing there with his big grin on his face with a brown bag with a thing  of spaghetti in it going, hey, man, I thought you guys might be hungry.  My father, I begged my father to drive me.  That's right.  The road conditions were so bad.  Yeah.  It was mandated by the police that you don't drive.  It was like one of those storms where it's just, it's almost a state of emergency.  And I had my father drive me.  How many miles to your house? 
[01:20:30]  It's probably 15 miles.  It was 15 miles.  It took about three hours.  Your father was such a trooper to bring you there.  Yeah, because I think he knew what a zero, he probably thought I was gay.  I'm like, dad, there's a girl there.  He's like, get in the car.  Go on.  Get in the car.  I'll get you there.  The funny thing was is that he was banging her in a bathroom and he had one foot in the  litter box.  Yeah.  I forgot bobbing those stupid cats.  It was dark.  Yeah, I did.  I was stepping in the litter box and I was banging what was probably a five and a half.  But because she was 18 and willing, you know, she was a nine as far as I was concerned. 
[01:21:00]  I forgot about that, dude.  And then we tried to switch on them and they got really mad.  So I went outside and dug their car out the next day to get them out of there.  They were so annoying.  They were 18.  All they wanted to do was take a bath the whole time.  The one, well, the one who slept with.  Well, look who they slept with.  The one who was annoyed was the one, I think, who slept with Bob because I think mine would  have switched off.  I think she just kind of, you know, hooked up with me just because I was there and her  friend was getting laid.  And you brought the food. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, that's right.  I did bring food.  Okay, so I was cooking in the back because you couldn't leave the house.  Yeah.  You weren't allowed to go.  All the stores were closed.  I think I brought spaghetti from my house and Bob made us spaghetti.  It was like a big family thing.  Your mom made the spaghetti.  Your dad drove you over there.  They were so happy.  The kid they thought was a fruit was going to have some fruit.  Bring a dish.  Bring a dish for the boys.  He said, call me after the rape.  I'll come pick you up.  Yeah, my dad had to come back in his toe pads the next day and pick me up.  And dad, smell my fingers.  High five. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, my God.  Those were the days.  So, dude, when am I going to see you again?  Soon, man.  We got to hang out in the city one day.  Definitely.  Yeah, I like that.  I miss seeing you.  It's amazing you talk to guys you haven't talked to.  I mean, I talk to Bob, not regularly, but more than you would think considering we never  see each other.  Yes.  We got to do a gig together, man.  We got to all do a gig together.  I know Bob Levy because he was on my, I did this talent show.  On Comedy Central.  Oh, yeah.  And he played a Jew wrestler.  What?  I did this show on Comedy Central. 
[01:22:30]  It was a pilot that didn't go, but they did air it.  It was called the Filthy Stupid Talent Show.  And it was like a talent show, but everybody was a fake.  We would just make them up.  So, he played a guy who comes out.  I go, what's your talent?  He goes, I'm a Jew wrestler.  I go, is there any Jews in the audience?  Yeah, I wrestled Jews.  So, we had a plant.  It was actually Sam Seder, this guy who does radio now.  And Sam comes on.  I go, are you Jewish?  And he goes, yeah.  And he's really unassuming.  And we choreographed this great wrestling.  And he ends up slamming Bob and beating him. 
[01:23:00]  And at the end, Bob goes, that guy was no Jew.  He was great.  I didn't know who he was.  I asked around, does anybody know somebody who's funny who can kind of wrestle?  I think Judah told you about him, yeah.  Yeah, Judah Freelander turned me on.  He was perfect.  Bob was perfect.  He was great.  Yeah, Bob's an animal.  Dude, are you fighting Bonaduce?  Yes, you know what?  I actually am.  When?  I'm donating all the money that I make to Jim's girlfriend's thing she's got.  She's got some kind of thing in Africa. 
[01:23:30]  So, I want them to build a school.  Oh, Florentine?  Are you serious or no?  Yeah, I swear to God.  I'm donating the money there, and they're going to build a school with my name on it.  It'll be spelled wrong.  Hey, Bob, if they're fighting Bonaduce, they should build a morgue with your name on it.  Yeah, I'm going to kill him, Jimmy.  Wait, wait a second.  Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, because it's a pretty good story that hasn't been told on  our show.  You've got to explain the Bonaduce thing there, Bob.  Well, I ended up smacking him in the face because I, actually, I wasn't drinking. 
[01:24:00]  I'm not drinking anymore, Jim.  Can you believe this?  I'm happy, man.  Good.  I'm on pills now, so that's bad.  So, now I'm on Lexapro, and I was on Xanax at the time, and I didn't have him with me,  and I just, like, was talking to him, and I was just kind of, like, freaking out, and  I just, he was being a douche, and I just smacked him, and I got attacked by, like, him  and three body guts threw me against the wall.  Wow.  And I was like, hey, this isn't too cool.  So, from there, it went to, it would be a charity thing, and we would give the money 
[01:24:30]  to whatever I donate, he'll donate to Robin's African tribe thing that she's collecting  money for, so.  It's funny, I forgot, dude, I've been having lunch with Colin a lot last week, I think  I had lunch with him three days after the show, I was just seeing Colin every day, and  he goes, I'm seeing Levy, because, you know, Colin can box, and Colin, you know, he's been  boxing for a long time, he doesn't look like it, but he can go, and so, Bobby, he was  going to see, do you guys work out in the gym, boxing, Jim, or something?  Yeah, I've been doing that, I've been running, and everything, it's amazing, Jim, it's the 
[01:25:00]  new me, I don't drink, I, there was every reason to drink last night, my audience, two  people in the audience rolled up in those roller chairs, you know, those, those scooters  last night, and I'm like, this is, there's every reason for me to go back on drugs and  drink, but I'm not going to.  Wait, when's this, is it just boxing, or is it just?  It's just going to be boxing.  Boy, those guys pounced on you, I'm watching the clip right now.  Yeah, I mean, I swear to God, I'm training, I am going to knock him out, I swear to God. 
[01:25:30]  Wow, it's going to be great.  I got like retard strength, man, I'll take that.  Bob is a strong dude, I mean, but Colin was saying, he goes, he was concerned for you,  because we're eating lunch, and he goes, yeah, but I've been talking to Levy about fighting  Bonaduce, who's a black belt, and I said, well, Bobby, you're boxing, or you're kickboxing,  and he goes, I'm on a treadmill.  Wait a minute, but what kind of, what's the fight, is it a boxing match?  Yes, yes.  He's a black belt?  Bonaduce?  Yeah, but that's not going to help him, that's not going to help him in a boxing match.  I'm almost, I'm like six inches bigger than him. 
[01:26:00]  I mean, he has no reach on me, it's like taking Rich Voss out of a crib, please.  I mean, I'm not worried about it.  No, it's all going to be.  I guarantee I knock him out.  I guarantee, I'm guaranteeing it.  He's going down.  No, Bonaduce is a multi-degree black belt, but what will help him is, he's been working out  for many, many years.  It's got a, it's all conditioning with boxing.  If you can last out the other guy conditioning, you'll be okay.  Well, that's what I've been doing.  I've been running, I've been walking, swimming, working out weights, punching bags. 
[01:26:30]  Bob, don't do it.  Bob, when are you fighting?  In September.  In September, I guarantee I knock him out.  I'm telling you guys, he's going down.  Uh-oh.  He's guaranteeing a knockout.  Can you do this on a Sunday night?  Where are you fighting him?  Because I really will, I will go see, I don't even want to go see my friend get his teeth  knocked him out.  You got to come down, because we're going to do a show in like Atlantic City on the 12th,  and then not with him, but, and then the 13th, it'll be somewhere, it might be at the  Tropicana.  What day is the 13th?  It's a Saturday, so you'll be off.  We're going to put the video up on onaradio.com, you and Bonaduce there. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, he's a douchebag, but what are you going to do?  Hey, man, you got guts fighting him, I'll tell you that much.  I mean, of course, I'm rooting, I'm rooting for you just to make it through, because he's  a bit of a psychopath.  Yeah.  Yeah, he is too.  He beat Vanilla Ice, didn't he?  Yeah.  Bonaduce, I think, was this one of the first celebrity boxing games, and he beat him really  bad.  He punched, what do you call it, who's that man cow in the face?  Yeah.  And knocked him out.  Good for him.  Yeah, he knocked him out.  Yeah.  Hey, listen, I've been married twice.  I will kill this man three times now. 
[01:27:30]  Are you on your third marriage?  I just got married three weeks ago.  Get out of here.  I swear to God.  You got the hat trick.  Why didn't you tell anybody?  Why?  I'm not like Voss that has a goddamn reception every two weeks.  Thank you.  Here we go again.  Here we go.  Stop.  Here we go again.  You want to come to the 8 o'clock or 10.30?  Thank you, Bob.  This comes up all the time on the show.  Thank you to Bob Levy. 
[01:28:00]  And then he gets mad at all his friends, like, we thought you were just doing sets.  I'm sorry.  Sorry we didn't show up.  What firehouse did you guys go to on your honeymoon?  Oh, now we're going to start.  You ain't going to get me on the phone, boss.  Well, dude, I...  Have I met her or no?  This girl is the best.  I'm telling you.  She doesn't drink.  She doesn't do drugs.  I mean, that's why I'm basically clean, you know?  20 years without a drink or drug in my body.  22, stupid. 
[01:28:30]  I mean, I talk to Colin a lot and work with him a little bit now.  And, like, he's a good help, you know, that mumbled mouth bastard.  But, I mean, when you can understand him, he does give you a good advice.  Colin?  It's working out well.  Colin?  Yeah, Colin's a good...  Yeah, Colin, did you hear what Bob Levy just said about you?  Yeah.  Oh, is he there?  Yeah.  He called me a mumbled mouth.  You don't really want me to add anything going out?  Wait a second.  A mumbled mouth?  I love him. 
[01:29:00]  So, Colin, he came in to box you.  Was he conditioned?  He's in top shape.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I thought I'd better flow right into this mediocre conversation.  I thought it was your stupid birthday bash.  It is.  Well, then, don't get me into Bob Levy's boxing conversation.  Big boxing conversation right now.  Well, we segued in.  I was just curious.  The last time I saw you, you said that he was going to come and you were going to see what  he had because you said he was going to do on the trip.  No, it didn't happen.  I had to go see Mother that day.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  He canceled our date.  Oh, really?  All right.  Damn it.  Ooh.  Well, I want to wish Jimmy a happy birthday.  I love you, Jimmy.  Thanks, Bobby.  Of course.  I will see you guys all soon and enjoy your birthday.  Thanks, buddy.  I miss seeing you, man.  Bob Levy, everyone.  All right, man.  I don't know, man.  Wow.  Bonaducey.  Bonaducey.  Listen to me.  Oh.  I'm going to cream him.  So what's up, Colin?  Nothing.  Nothing.  What's wrong, Colin? 
[01:30:00]  Nothing.  I'm just going up.  I'm trying to get into the vibe of the conversation, but I'm not doing too good.  What do you guys think is host, or I think is the best for the birthday boy?  How about all of us?  We'll all take a hit on this one.  We mutually suck.  It's not my fault.  Colin, are you close to the station?  Why don't you come by and say hi?  Oh, no.  I'm way far away from.  Why don't you jump out of your apartment and come by?  No, no.  I'm nowhere near there.  Carl, we have some people.  The guy's making egg omelets, and we also have some delicious birthday cake.  This is good food here. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  It's delicious.  I'll leave you some jokes, though, if you want, for your...  Are you working this weekend?  Okay.  I'll give you some birthday jokes.  I'll give you some free jokes.  That's what we do.  Give each other stuff.  That is what we do on a birthday.  You'll call up and give your friend, like, a doggy bag of birthday jokes.  Yeah.  I'll give you one.  Ready?  Sure.  See Brangelini's kids?  I guess they got bored by just being called Mr. and Mrs. Smith after all.  Ah, that's not bad.  It's kind of cool.  Yeah.  I didn't even understand that. 
[01:31:00]  Who did I?  Because Mr. and Mrs. Smith was a movie.  Right.  And the kids would kind of have it, like, because they're married now, and they really  are a Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  How do you not get that?  Why are they a Mr. and Mrs. Smith?  I don't understand.  Oh, look at Jamie and Spears as their baby.  I mean, she's only 15.  He's just rolling on to the next one.  Wait.  What was the next one?  I don't want to miss the next one.  Yeah.  Look at Jamie and Spears, she's only 15.  She's got a baby, and the kid looks like Britney with a shaved head.  So you and Bob are writing together?  Yeah, but at least we're trying. 
[01:31:30]  We don't just look out in the audience for five minutes.  So why don't we, are we going to lunch together today?  What is it?  Are we?  Yeah.  I didn't know what was happening with this big extravaganza.  Well, I mean, it's obviously, it's a bash.  I mean, we all understand that.  It's crazy in here.  I mean, not only are you on the phone.  We all understand that.  Yeah, we got you on the phone.  We've had Louie. 
[01:32:00]  We got Bobby Levy, Florentine.  I mean, it's, you know, it's Voss, of course.  Action packed.  We got Voss.  It's crazy, man.  I have a Batman mask, and Voss is going to be doing some Heath Ledger Joker lines.  Ah.  Yeah, can you do that after the break there, Voss?  We got a little acting thing going on, Kyle.  A little back and forth.  I'm going to wear my Batman mask, and Voss is going to,  do the Joker lines.  I didn't know if I, I don't.  You guys are living it up.  That's Billy Batsby.  You guys are having a ball over there.  Yeah, mess up my party.  Yeah.  All right, Kyle, we got to take a break there. 
[01:32:30]  Come in if you want.  Yeah, come on in.  What are you doing?  We know you're close.  Come on.  Come on.  I'm gay.  What?  It's already been miserable for me.  Don't be gay.  Just come in.  Come on in.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Yeah, I'll be gay.  Oh, that's it.  That way I'm coming.  Good.  All right.  Colin Quinn might be joining the show after the break.  Can I give this out?  Because I tried to update it while I was in the toilet, and I forgot to hit send, so I  didn't update.  I was going to give a birthday update.  If you want to contact me, I will hear your messages, and I do respond to some of them. 
[01:33:00]  917-267-2602.  That is actually a cell number.  I can hear the messages from, and I can respond back to you.  I don't with everyone.  And that info is up on onaradio.com.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, we made it easy for you there, Jimmy.  You're not going to be charged anything except whatever your cell phone company charges you.  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  We'll continue.  It's Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, of course, Rich Voss, and of course, Louis C.K. as well.  Very, very busy to D.  Hi, I'm Brian Wilson.  How are you? 
[01:33:30]  I'm fine.  Happy Jimmy Day to little Jimmy the Joke Man modeling.  I invented Monster Rain.  Tell him, Fred.  Jim Norton's birthday.  My birthday, short foreign person.  Happy birthday to you, Jimmy.  Happy birthday to you.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you guys for acknowledging my birthday. 
[01:34:00]  It's very nice about you.  Of course.  It's a big birthday show.  A young Opie is taking me out later for a nice dinner.  Nice.  No way.  It certainly is.  Wow.  Good boy.  A little steak dinner.  Actually, Ant, you were invited, but you haven't called anyone back yet.  Yeah, Ant.  What?  When was I invited?  Why, I?  Danny, was Ant invited to the big steak dinner tonight?  Yes.  I was.  That's all right.  I'm, you know, I don't know what I'm doing any given moment. 
[01:34:30]  You know how it is?  Wild.  I have a story about Jimmy.  You do?  Yeah.  We got Louis C.K. in studio.  Oh, yes.  Why don't we play with our noise makers?  Rich?  What does this one do?  This one don't work.  Louis's got a story.  All right.  Don't blow on that, Rich.  Jim's got a story first.  I had that in my butt crack. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, good.  He actually, yeah, during the spot, he shoved the mouthpiece of Rich Voss's noisemaker right  No, he did.  Right against his, yeah, he did.  He put it right down the crack and just rubbed and rubbed and rubbed.  You've got to assume that everything in this room has been in there.  If you don't believe us, look at Kenny.  Kenny is dying.  He's loving this.  What happened, Kenny?  You were set up.  I will say, I got to tell Voss the truth. 
[01:35:30]  He was in vomit.  I didn't put, I just, it was just.  Just in the crack.  Just in a sweaty crack.  I got my cheek, really.  Yeah, he didn't shove it in his, you know.  No.  But, you know.  Like Jim would otherwise go, hey, Rich, let's make fun with some noisemakers.  No, because a lot.  He would have any reason to do that except for that.  I couldn't do it, Jones.  It's been in his area.  I couldn't do it for real.  So, Louis, you got a story about Jimmy?  All right, sir.  Festive.  We're working on Lucky Louis. 
[01:36:00]  There was a writer on the show who lived in Venice, California.  And a friend of hers started a, just got her license to be a masseuse of physical therapy,  whatever, you know, like a real legitimate, you know, really studied.  And so she opened a place and it was very medical looking and had a name like therapeutic  center for massage, you know.  And so this guy comes, a client, and he's getting a massage and he starts going, so anything  else that could happen here? 
[01:36:30]  And she knows what he's, she's hip.  She goes, no.  And he goes, well, I'm just saying maybe a little something else.  And he was kind of pushing and she's going, no, nothing else is going to happen here.  And he kind of kept, and then she noticed his jacket draped over the chair, said Lucky  Louis on it.  And she said, oh, a friend of mine writes for that show.  And he turned pale immediately and went, I got to go now.  Nobody has to know about this, do they?  Here's the thing.  I was totally, I've never told Jim that I knew this story. 
[01:37:00]  She told me the story and I think I'm the only person she told.  Here's why she told him that story, I'll bet you.  Because I think.  I didn't meet the woman, the writer who worked on the show, it was her friend.  There was a weird vibe to that moment.  Yeah, I bet.  But there were possibilities.  I think there were.  It was her and another girl.  Yes.  That's right.  She said there was two of them.  Two girls.  And they let me be naked.  They let me be undraped.  And they.  Undraped.  What does that mean?  Undraped.  Think of draped, but not. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  I think also they were new.  It was a new business.  Was that?  You were on a table naked?  Yeah.  That's what undraped means.  I think it was a new business.  So probably there was something, a turn on for you that they were like new at it.  And it was.  Yes.  Something undefined about the place.  And when she recognized me.  Because on the phone it was kind of dicey.  I didn't know exactly.  But it wasn't a definite no.  I would not have driven that far.  I was so embarrassed.  I was totally naked.  I had to tinkle.  So I had to get up and just walk naked while the two girls sat. 
[01:38:00]  But I think one left the room for a while.  Probably the writer's friend.  So I'm going to leave the room.  She'll massage you for a little bit.  Something would have happened there.  Yeah.  But I think she only told you.  So if I went and told you, you would go, oh yeah, I heard that story.  It was legitimate.  That was called a preempt to strike in case I had a big mouth.  I think you're right.  That's great.  Of course it was.  I think you're right.  That's pretty funny though.  I didn't have a girlfriend back then.  Not that I would have stopped.  No, I knew that.  I figured you wouldn't mind.  No.  Hey, we were lucky to talk to Christian Bale.  What?  Batman, yeah.  Danny talked to Christian Bale. 
[01:38:30]  He talked to Christian Bale like they talked to Christian Bale on TV.  Yeah.  Danny sat down with Christian Bale.  Nice interview.  Yeah.  Sure.  We got the interview here, Danny.  Sure do.  How was it meeting Christian Bale?  He's actually a real nice guy in person.  He can come off a little intimidating.  Yeah.  But I didn't find that to be the case once you meet him in person.  Yeah, this dark night is going to be huge.  We saw it already, Louie.  Is it good?  Amazing.  Heath Legger was so good.  Legger.  It's his movie. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Heath Legger.  Yeah.  He plays the Joker.  He's like really funny.  It must be funny if he's a Joker.  Yeah.  I love jokes.  I prefer the Riddler.  I don't like Riddles because they make me anxious that I'm not going to know the answers.  Yeah.  It's got a lot of pressure.  I prefer jokes because they're funny.  Yeah.  You feel like you're laughing at a joke.  I just like having my leg pulled.  That's why I like jokes.  Well, don't go to the masseuse he went to.  Yeah.  That's all you'll get pulled.  Come on, guys.  Crazy.  So, Danny sat down with Christian Bale and this is how it went.  Hey, this is Danny from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:39:30]  Recently, I had the opportunity to sit down with Christian Bale to talk about his role  as Batman in the upcoming Hollywood blockbuster, The Dark Knight.  Where do we begin?  Tell me a little bit about Batman in this film.  You know, this is a more mature Bruce Wayne.  This is a Batman who absolutely is still warring with himself, but it's somebody who has come  to have power and is now dealing with the burden of responsibility of that power.  Was it hard remembering how to play him?  No.  I mean, I have a very definite mast of who Batman is now, you know, more so than ever. 
[01:40:00]  I've seen now what have to become to stop men like him.  How about the Batman voice?  Any trouble with that?  It's like riding a bike with that.  You know, the first one, yeah, I had to really kind of practice it, but by the second time,  I just bang, it just happened straight away.  Well, the reason I ask is that Jim Norton thinks it sounds a bit like Clint Eastman.  What do you think?  I think, first of all, anybody who's saying that should just shut up, you know?  I mean, they have no idea.  It's arrogant.  It's ridiculous.  Can you do the voice for us?  I'm Batman.  Just one more time.  I'm Batman.  Wow, that's great. 
[01:40:30]  But it does sound a bit like Eastwood.  What do you think?  No.  Thanks for taking the time to talk about the new film.  Thank you.  And here we go.  Batman, The Dark Knight opens nationwide July 18th.  So, yeah, things got a little tense there towards the end.  Yeah, I see that there.  The acting is so good.  I thought you were in the room.  In The Dark Knight, I agree.  No, no, I thought you were in the room with Christian Bale, the way you asked those questions. 
[01:41:00]  I thought he was in the room with us.  That's how good the acting was.  I thought that Danny was actually here.  All right, Christian Bale.  Afterwards, you know, he respected my journalism skills for asking unorthodox questions.  Ah, okay.  It's the perfect delivery for the bit is what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  It really is.  Hey, were you commenting on the sing-songy delivery?  Yes.  So, could you do the Batman voice?  Yes.  A way that he never would have spoken to.  Well, see, I didn't want to take Christian out of his element, so I wanted to interview 
[01:41:30]  him in the style that he's so accustomed to on television and in other radio interviews.  Jimmy thinks you sound like Clint Eastwood.  Let me do that one again.  Danny's voice was so up and down.  He sounded like different audio spliced together as one person.  Jimmy thinks you sound like a speaking spell.  Speaking of acting, we got some Heath Ledger Joker clips for Rich Voss.  Are we got dialogue?  Where's the scripts?  I hand you the scripts live on the show here, Rich. 
[01:42:00]  I don't...  Rich is such a good actor.  He said, you know what?  I want to read this cold.  I don't need to practice.  I can sound just as good as Heath Ledger as the Joker.  Was that him at the end when he goes, here now we go?  Here now we go.  God, he was a goddamn good man.  Yes.  Oh, I wish I had my glasses.  He took a character we all knew and loved and just made it different, Lou.  And then he died from pills.  He certainly did.  Have another.  I don't want to... 
[01:42:30]  Where's Louie's copy?  Who's going to be person?  I'll be person.  Yeah, Jimmy will be person.  It's his birthday.  He's got to be person.  And where's your glasses?  Well, I don't care.  I didn't know I was, you know...  He goes like this to read.  He puts the paper way out here.  Well, because I can't...  I wish they would have made a much bigger font for this.  All right.  It's a pretty big font.  Well, I can't see the first.  We'll start at no. 
[01:43:00]  No.  You can't see that?  How about this?  Can we get a bigger font?  Bigger font.  Wow.  Yeah, much bigger.  A much bigger font.  Oh, God.  What the hell?  I'm sorry that...  Shut up.  You're going to lose this one.  You're going to...  Your career's over.  This is just normal font.  What if you get a real job and you go, I can't...  This font's too small.  Right.  I'll have glasses with me.  And they go, let's get somebody else.  Then I'll say, well...  Did you drive in today?  Yeah.  You drove in today.  I can see not...  When you get older... 
[01:43:30]  When you get older...  When you get older...  He's going to explain my opium, whatever it is now.  All right.  I could see perfectly fine.  I could see...  If you put something on the wall over there, I could see it and read it.  All right.  We'll put the script over there.  On the wall.  There you go.  Shut up.  Is this...  I need something.  This is normal print.  What is wrong with you?  I'm 51.  That's what's wrong with me.  Wow.  Okay.  So now we've got to wait for the big font.  But I had a colonoscopy again last week. 
[01:44:00]  Again?  Why?  No, I mean...  Because I had an upper endoscopy and then a colonoscopy and everything's fine.  He's not saying words that you just learned.  He loves the fact that he knows that word.  Yes.  Upper endoscopy.  Whoa.  Look at you.  What?  That's not a big deal.  Yep.  Those brain cells are working for you.  Today.  You know...  All right.  We could go another direction.  It's up to Jimmy because it's his birthday.  We could do the...  We got a nice porn story.  Or we got a woman that wrote a book on how to train men. 
[01:44:30]  Train?  I see.  Doesn't that happen every 20 years or so?  Yeah.  Some woman writes a book about how men are dogs and you train them like dogs.  Want to give this a try?  I think so.  All right.  There was a Doris Day movie about it even.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Some trying to be empowered woman.  Ugh.  You know, just, you know, make him bark and he'll beg.  Shut up.  Make him bark and he'll beg.  Whatever these dummies say.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  The woman who wrote the book on how to train your husband.  All right.  Here's a story a lot of people are going to be talking about and you want to hear about 
[01:45:00]  this because we're talking about clothes, for example, dumped on the floor, dishes piled  high in the sink.  Some people say enough to make...  What was that noise?  Terry Schiavo.  Came out straight out of between her legs.  That thing makes noises.  She sounded like something hairy being ridden in Star Wars.  Yeah.  Dumped on the floor, dishes piled high in the sink. 
[01:45:30]  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  What is that?  How fat is her fat throat?  Idiot.  Non-man loser.  Terry Schiavo.  Dishes piled high in the sink.  Some people say...  That is a horrid sound. 
[01:46:00]  For example, dumped on the floor, dishes piled high in the sink.  I can't get enough of that.  I think we can play it another five times.  It's going to be just as funny.  Just the sound of a walnut brain going out through a throat. 
[01:46:30]  I'm talking about clothes, for example, dumped on the floor, dishes piled high in the sink.  Some people say enough.  Does it sound like a guy's stupid?  Does it?  Does it really?  Oh God, that is a horrid sound.  All right.  All right.  Here's a story a lot of people are going to be talking about.  Let's try to get through it.  We want to hear about this because we're talking about clothes, for example, dumped on the floor,  dishes piled high in the sink.  Some people say enough to make... 
[01:47:00]  Just like a guy.  ...any wife scream at her husband.  But a controversial new book says there may just be a way to teach old husbands new tricks.  Oh yeah.  Let's hear this.  Mox's Jan Jeffcoat.  Check this one out.  Did she now?  Did she check that out?  Here's one for the ladies.  Yeah, girls.  Oh, we bleed every month.  We don't like dirt.  We're going to show you how to train those men.  Those dirty men.  The guys all go like this and the women go like that. 
[01:47:30]  Death to all of them.  Teach an old husband new tricks.  How terrible is she at her job?  Ugh.  Let's meet the author.  She's terrible at existing.  Here's the author.  I hate her.  If God created man, he didn't create perfect husbands.  And now women are demanding better behavior from their better half by getting romance  recommendations from this woman, Amy Sutherland, author of What Shamu Taught Me About Life,  Love, and Marriage.  I think of...  That sounds like a fun book. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Doesn't it?  What what taught me about...  Shamu.  Shamu.  I don't get...  Shamu.  Is a killer whale.  That's why I quit reading.  Maybe she saw Shamu, the killer whale, and learned from him.  What's Shamu Taught?  Oh, yeah.  God.  We got to get this author on the show, by the way.  That's what we should have done today.  Because this reminds me of a book that I once read where the woman was inspired by Orca.  It was How Not to Stick Your Leg in the Killer Whale's Mouth, Biatch.  Long way to go.  Boo.  It's your birthday, though.  Boo.  No boos for Jimmy today. 
[01:48:30]  I deserve a boo.  No, no.  Not on your birthday.  Wait, that woman wants to chime in again.  Yeah.  That sounds just like her.  Like a guy.  Just like a guy.  Oh, those men.  Oh.  I think of it as communication.  After spending time with some of the best animal trainers in the world, she decided to  start thinking like them and use the same techniques to teach dolphins to do this. 
[01:49:00]  Teach your husband, Scott, to be a better spouse.  It's just dawned on me if it worked out.  You know what?  You write a book like this about chicks.  Well, we're animals, too.  Oh, my God.  And then you're equating a girl with an animal, and it's a horrid, horrid thing.  And also, women can't be trained because they stink.  Can you imagine doing it on the news, though?  Yeah.  Well, I was an animal trainer, so I figured I'd know how to train women.  So I'm going to use the same techniques.  I'm going to smack her on the nose of the newspaper and shove her face in her feces so she doesn't 
[01:49:30]  do that again.  I'm going to put peanut butter on my crotch.  Keep her in a crate so when she pees, she has to live with it.  Right.  This technique is going to just drive a bunch of guys crazy.  Hold on a second.  Hello?  Oh, why are you calling during the show?  Thank you.  I'm on the radio.  Who's that, Jimmy?  Who's that?  Wow.  Who's that?  Someone who was immediately hung up on.  Who's that?  Who's that? 
[01:50:00]  Who's that?  My friend, Betty.  Betty?  Betty?  Me, you, Betty?  You've got a friend named Betty?  What do you girls do together?  You and Betty?  Me, you, Betsy.  I'm on the radio.  Betty.  You have a friend named Betty?  Yeah.  How old is she?  82.  Does she have big pearls, like a necklace with large pearls?  She will later.  Get it, Betty?  Yeah.  Here's a technique that this lady wants you to use on your husband. 
[01:50:30]  Sutherland says the first step, stop nagging.  Because I realize, one, that's punishment.  And two, it's also something that a trainer would never do, is that trainers don't keep doing  the same thing over and over and over.  Instead, use what animal trainers call the least reinforcing scenario.  The least reinforcing factor is a new way of animal training.  It basically focuses on constantly rewarding the positive.  So if your spouse comes to dinner, you can reward him with a treat, like these seals  are getting, or you can reward them with a hug.  Oh, la, la, la, la.  Exactly.  There's the only treat. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, trout.  Smells the same.  Smells the same.  It pays to be quiet, actually.  The idea is, if there's no reaction, the bad behavior will stop.  Oh, my.  Yeah, we're so simple-minded.  It's so badly done.  Yeah.  Starting with the whale, first of all.  Yeah.  It's just not an animal you think about training.  Right.  Like, oh, yeah, like a whale, you know, training.  When you think of training, you think of whales.  Idiot.  I know.  And she segues into fleas.  Stupid bitch. 
[01:51:30]  She does everything she says now, but he scrapes his butt across the floor to itch it.  I train my husband like a dog, except instead of fetching the paper, he blackens my eye  like Jake LaMotta.  Shut up.  Female marriage counselor is not into this at all.  Evanston, marriage counselor Victoria Baum, looks at Sutherland's theory as a malicious  marriage manipulation.  I wouldn't want a couple or a member of a couple to read this book, especially a woman,  and think she's going to train her husband.  She also adds the least reinforcing scenario is a scenario for disaster. 
[01:52:00]  The idea of positive reinforcement is wonderful, but to ignore the negative means that you're  holding in and you're not getting your needs and your wants either communicated or met.  And maybe that's the way the husband should treat the wife when she gets fat or when they  get that stupid mullet or when they start wearing jeans and tucking in their shirt and  losing their sex appeal and not wanting to before sleep.  Yeah.  How about that?  Shut up.  So irritating.  Sutherland, however, maintains this is a different way of communicating. 
[01:52:30]  She noticed immediate results in her relationship.  What I found is that it saved us a tremendous amount of wear and tear.  Plus, she says anyone can use these training techniques to improve relationships with friends,  family, or even coworkers.  Even with myself, how I've used these ideas to sort of, you know, change behaviors in myself  that have been entrenched for a long time.  But there is one thing she still hasn't mastered.  You know, it'd be great if he'd sit and stay, but that's beyond...  Well, you didn't say that. 
[01:53:00]  Boy, they really brought it home with a...  That's funny.  Yeah, that's funny.  Just listening to her voice.  Who wouldn't want to marry that girl?  That woman.  What news organization is that?  That's the worst edited piece.  Yeah.  First, let's interview her in traffic so everybody can listen to buses going by.  Like, she's an author.  You couldn't get her in the studio for a minute?  We've got to go talk to her, you know, on 6th Avenue and 58th Street. 
[01:53:30]  Speaking of TV, Louie, we've got a big TV surprise for Lil' Jimmy Norn.  A surprise?  Well, yeah.  It was supposed to be.  Oh.  Yeah, but we've got local TV coming in next for Lil' Jimmy Norn.  Well, wasn't that confirmed?  Yes, I sent the email to everybody.  CC'd.  And there's supposed to be some girls coming in or something that Steve told me about?  Yeah.  So, we'll take a break and we'll do that next.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  It's Jimmy Day.  Just shut up.  A celebration in honor of James Norton. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, hairs.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Jimmy's birthday.  And it's his real birthday.  Not those fake ones over the course of the year.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  From all of us at the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  This has been a perfect birthday show because everything is going wrong.  And that's what we expect when we do these birthday shows. 
[01:54:30]  So, we're just about to go to break a few minutes ago.  And we do.  We go to break.  And at that moment.  That second we went to break.  At that second, the camera crew comes in.  Jill Nicolini.  A cake is lit.  A cake.  All the candles.  Completely off the air.  It was the big moment that was supposed to be captured on the air.  But these people were cued right as we went to commercials.  Fredo made a more dignified entrance than the first Godfather. 
[01:55:00]  It was amazing how funny and just mistimed that was.  And Godfrey came over.  I'm happy Godfrey, a comedian, came over from the CW.  He was talking about the Emmys over there.  And now he's here hanging with us.  This is a clusterf today, my friend.  This is awesome.  But, and then Steve is yelling and screaming.  And then he attempted to punch Danny in the face.  All hell broke loose.  There was some violence.  I got to say something. 
[01:55:30]  Danny did not twitch.  No.  Like, Steve came running over.  It looked like the running of the bulls.  Like, Steve came over.  He said he was going to belt Danny.  Yeah.  And then Danny said something like, oh, shut up.  Yeah.  I'm going to say something completely unbelievable right now.  And so just everybody in regular line, get ready.  Steve isn't that stupid.  Well, he ran at you.  But he's not that stupid.  He didn't run at you.  And Danny didn't even twitch.  Danny didn't blink. 
[01:56:00]  Like, I'd kind of, you know, I'd twist a little bit.  Well, Danny said something like, do it.  So Steve just charged Danny.  Charged that.  He stopped literally a centimeter from his face.  I was standing right behind Danny.  And I was a little, ugh.  You know what kind of settlement that would be?  I know.  Hey, look.  The cake is burning out of control now.  What cake, Opie?  Is there a cake?  I wouldn't know if there was a cake.  Oh, my God.  Here comes the cake.  Oh, they're all blown out.  It's the beautiful Jill Nicolini from the CW11. 
[01:56:30]  You're welcome.  Take a look at your cake.  Oh, it's got me.  And I'm standing behind what appears to be a woman.  And let's just say she's wearing a pink sock.  Yeah.  And there's a teehee coming out of my mouth and a word splurt.  I don't know what that means.  Oh, let me blow out the candles.  They've only been burning for 45 minutes.  Yes, coming out the commercial while they're doing the American forgery.  How do you get a pink sock birthday cake?  Yeah, that's pretty good.  All right.  Can we clap it up for blowing out the candles? 
[01:57:00]  There it is.  Bravo.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Nice.  Thank you so much.  And this is...  Thanks, Dan.  And a year ago today, we met Jill Nicolini for the first time, right?  Yes, we did.  It was the first time that...  Why don't you just sit on Anthony's lap?  Okay.  Yeah, it was the first time Jill actually came into the studio.  Right.  She was wearing a little yellow number that day.  And I took a picture with her.  And I laugh at that picture when I look at it because I'm nervous little Nelly.  Well, I think I was all sweaty.  Yeah, like a little boy meeting his movie star hero. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, because it was, you know, the pretty helicopter girl and I was just kind of like...  And I sat right there and he wouldn't even look at me.  No.  I was looking at Opie the whole time, Jimmy, and I saw you a little nervous, but I didn't  think...  And now 800,000 pictures later.  Yeah.  Because Jill sure likes taking pictures.  Uh-huh.  Which is me.  I know.  Then, look at that.  I wish you would have came in at 6.15 so Anthony could have been part of the show from the  beginning today. 
[01:58:00]  What happened?  It takes a film crew to wake Anthony up.  Well, I was a little sleepy this morning.  Louie looks at me after one of the segments.  He goes, was Anthony even in studio the last 40 minutes?  I thought, is he gone?  Is he here today?  And he was sitting in that chair the whole time.  Oh, yeah.  He was so in the chair.  He had a rough night.  Well, you know what it was?  You guys were telling stories about, you know, Jimmy and debauchery and stuff, and I really  didn't have much to add.  Oh, wait.  This is great.  Save it for the commercial. 
[01:58:30]  Don't spoil it on the air.  Where's Steve?  I don't want him to feel left out and bad.  Steve, get in there.  I don't want him to feel bad.  It was just a...  It would have been a perfect ending to your birthday show.  It actually...  A fist fight.  It couldn't have happened in a better way.  It wouldn't have been a fist fight.  Oh, no.  It would have been a fist on my face.  No, she's not Steve.  Yeah, it would have just been one fist.  Oh, here comes Steve.  Oh, my Steve.  He's on Lebanese.  And in this corner.  On Lebanese.  So, we think...  I just...  It had to happen that way.  Oh, of course.  It couldn't have been more perfect than the cake and everything coming in on the... 
[01:59:00]  It just couldn't have happened.  It's a perfect end to a perfect birthday.  Happy birthday.  Dude, I don't even know if we've done this justice.  I go, we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  And at that moment, the film crew...  Yeah, everyone walks in.  The cake with the candles burning come walking through the door.  That's the amazing...  As if it was really important that it be off the air.  Right.  A very private matter.  Yeah, private matter.  Whatever you do, this is nobody's business.  This is an affair of the heart.  Keep it between us.  I will say this to Jim, and I won't spoil anything. 
[01:59:30]  This is only part one.  So, I have been on the...  I have been making so many calls with regards to your birthday.  My brain is in...  Who do you got for part two?  Who do you have...  It's a surprise.  It's a surprise.  I think it's in all that hard work.  If it's not on the air, it's worthless.  It's a surprise that starts at noon.  I actually do have another surprise for you.  I have two things for you.  For your birthday, we're giving you a gift certificate from the CW11.com. 
[02:00:00]  To Destino's Restaurant, and it's a great place.  Where is it?  It's on First Avenue, I believe.  Oh, thank you.  In the 40s.  It's 891 First Avenue.  And it's part of our Dining Picks thing.  Then, of course, you know, I bought your friend over here for you.  Now, you have one more surprise.  During the XM hour, you have a very, very special guest.  Big celebrity.  And if you've been watching the CW11 this morning, you may know.  Or if not, you may see this special guest coming up soon. 
[02:00:30]  Not to give too much away, but...  Someone who was on our show this morning will be back.  Huge celebrity.  Does he know who Jimmy is?  Of course he knows who Jimmy is.  Is it Smug Guy?  Oh!  No, Smug Guy.  I wanted him.  Well, he couldn't come.  He had worked this morning.  Yeah, apparently it's time to celebrate.  Is it him?  Back to you in the studio.  Is it Emily Francis on the way to the unemployment line?  Oh, no.  She's just on vacation. 
[02:01:00]  Jeez, Hopi.  The cake is very...  Is this from the CW11?  Yes.  Thank you.  This is really good.  Yum.  How do they get a pink sock birthday cake, Jimmy?  That is a good one.  I'm not double dipping.  And then I have to run...  What?  And then I'm running Commando today.  Oh, let's explain the reason why.  There was a little problem last night.  What?  I couldn't find my goddamn underwear this morning.  Yeah.  I think the cat dragged it off.  One pair?  We woke up and searched, running around the bedroom because the cat had to have taken her 
[02:01:30]  and a little teeth, the little kitten that was in here.  Nice.  Yeah.  And ran off with my underwear somewhere in the house.  And, you know, I was pretty tired this morning.  It was very hard to get out of bed.  Yeah, you're grumpy.  And the last thing you want to do is bend over naked to look under the bed.  Never a good angle.  No.  So I just put my pants on and...  You have no other underwear except for the one pair the cat stole?  That's not true.  Wait, wait.  No, Keith did bring clothes to the CW11 for me and for you. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, but I didn't take the underwear.  Well, you should have.  How awful your underwear the two animals are fighting over.  There must be a lot of protein in that.  For a cat.  There's a dog burying it.  A little pate for the cats.  Oh, man.  Hey, we got another surprise.  Where's the next birthday cake?  Another surprise.  Another you gotta be.  Yeah, let's bring in the next birthday cake.  That's real breakfast right there? 
[02:02:30]  That's real breakfast right there?  Yeah, you have an omelet.  Oh, cool.  Another cake.  Another cake?  And this is always awkward.  The staff here at CBS coming in with their birthday cake.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, Jim Norton.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:03:00]  That's pretty good, huh?  The staff here in New York.  Sales guys without ties so they can try to fit in.  That's crazy.  Take the ties off.  Let's loosen up on a Friday.  Yeah, let's take the ties off before we go in there.  It's out of control.  It's a casual day.  Get the guy in the stripes.  Come closer.  Come closer.  Hey, a normal birthday cake.  That looks good.  Thank you very much.  Strawberries with chocolate on them.  No corn pictures on that one, Jimmy.  That looks delicious.  Look at that.  You're right.  They all took off their top.  And we also have an exit.  Yeah.  They do want to finish.  They're so calculated, these people. 
[02:03:30]  There's madness in here.  This cake.  Unbutton the top one.  Yeah, all right.  Be loose.  Yeah.  Chaos.  These guys are really loose.  They're really casual.  Yeah, this is awesome.  Oh, thank you very much.  Thank you for the cake, too.  All right.  I appreciate that.  You guys want an omelet or anything from Basil Tees?  Yeah, there's food over there.  They're trying to make us looser.  Tom's River.  Enjoy yourself.  They're trying to make us looser.  I'm going to eat some cake.  Leave.  Go back to corporate life.  Jimmy, it's your birthday.  You eat whatever you want. 
[02:04:00]  I know.  I'm going to really eat like a pig.  I'll keep it between us, guys.  Put on your Batman mask for the CW.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Dark Knight is awesome.  Did you go see it?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Was it awesome?  It's amazing.  Keith Ledger was great.  What happened?  Who else?  Clint Eastwood was really good as Batman.  I'm Batman.  All right.  We get it.  We get it.  It's silly.  I'm Batman.  It looks so silly.  That's the only thing anyone's going to see is you in the mask.  That's all they should see. 
[02:04:30]  That's it.  Look, I'm Batman.  Batman, and I like reading good books.  Shameless plug.  I didn't plug.  I'm just holding it up because that's what Batman does.  You know what an ass I feel like?  Don't show this on the television.  I'll look foolish.  I'm 40 years old, and I'm doing this.  This is like me being crazy.  I put on the mask, guys, and this is all they'll show.  What a tool of a comic.  Radio silly man.  I know.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm on the radio wearing a funny mask. 
[02:05:00]  You've got to have the horn.  Make the horn hit, though.  I am a true fool.  You really are.  It's awesome, though.  All kidding aside, thank you, everybody.  All kidding aside.  You know, to not look like an ass, I want to say thank you to the staff.  And for me, we're all getting nuts.  You guys are not ties.  Oh, wow.  You guys are really missing something at home.  He's got the lips of a cat.  What's that?  Is this like, it is almost like the Halle Berry Catwoman one. 
[02:05:30]  I'm Batman.  Christian Bale stinks.  Was he mad in that?  No, he's a great actor, but his choice to just grovel voice the whole thing.  Heath Ledger is putting on an Oscar-worthy performance, and he's just disguising himself.  It would have been like a five-year-old trying to sound different on the phone.  It would have been great if they spent all the money on the movie, but he just wore a  mask like that with a rubber band in the actual Batman movie.  Yeah, all the effects and everything.  Like all of that, but for him, they just put a rubber band, and he's wearing a Batman  t-shirt, just running around. 
[02:06:00]  And then the Joker comes behind him and snaps the rubber band and says, shut up.  He falls down.  And he's got a Halloween-like bag the whole time.  And the original Commissioner Gordon comes in and administers a good teabagging.  I'm Batman.  And then Adam West takes over.  Oh, boy.  We got greedy.  Oh, boy.  We got greedy.  All right.  Well, let's just shut up.  I don't want to put the headphones on and look silly. 
[02:06:30]  Jimmy, you look awful.  Of course I look awful.  The worst thing is the shaved head.  Look at the profile.  The shaved head with the mask in front of it is really...  Imagine this shows up to rescue you from peril.  From peril.  Look at that.  With the no chin.  Yeah, my weak chin and my fat Mr. Freeze neck.  I'll save you, madam.  Oh, God.  Bad barely a man.  Well, this couldn't be more dignified a way to spend my 40th birthday, 18 years in entertainment, 
[02:07:00]  and I'm putting on a mask.  But thank you to the CW11.  It's very nice of you guys to, I'm sure, feature this.  Oh, yeah.  It'll be on our website.  Yeah.  This is a website piece.  That's what I hear whenever the news of somebody films me.  No, no.  We're not going to show up at the CW11.com.  The website.  That's where everybody goes.  That's where it goes.  Which gets an extreme amount of hits, so it's a good one.  Of course it does.  But, yeah, Jill and Anthony met here on my birthday a year ago. 
[02:07:30]  Yes.  Oh, that's cool.  And she came in.  It was a celebration of my birthday, but, you know, she liked Anthony, and I guess I've  been dealing with that for eight years.  You've been dealing with it for 12.  Anthony's terrific.  I'm likable.  I get it.  I'm just a likable guy.  You're lovable.  What can I say?  He's sweet.  Aww.  Yes.  Make everyone sick.  All right.  Did you hear the lit?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Boss is deeply disturbed.  Oh, my God. 
[02:08:00]  What's up?  No, ugh.  Why ugh?  What's the matter, Rich?  I don't know.  Hey, I want to hear tongue.  Rich is all bummed out.  Do you want to hear some tongue?  Why are you bummed out, Rich?  Do the tongue thing.  Do the tongue thing.  Let's hear tongue.  Listen.  Shh.  Quiet.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Nice.  Nice.  I like that.  That was awesome.  I used to kiss like that.  What is this?  Junior high?  Yeah.  Look at that.  Something that's like Hitler kissing a pretty girl.  Like?  It is. 
[02:08:30]  My Ava Braun.  Oh, man.  Hey, our boss is here.  You got some words today?  Boss.  Hello.  You better say something.  Come over here.  You better say something for Jimmy's birthday.  How are you?  I saw you outside.  Here comes Mara.  Our boss is kissing on the radio.  On her own network.  Smell good.  There she is.  It's called vodka.  Get over there.  Oh, it's gin?  Get over there and say something. 
[02:09:00]  You're the boss.  I know your name.  I saw you outside.  Get on mic.  Get on mic.  Over there.  You've been in radio 20-some odd years.  Have we actually met yet?  No, we haven't.  We haven't.  Yeah, you're the new boss.  I've heard of you.  Yeah, I've heard of you.  Pleasure.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Thanks for taking her.  That's always good.  That's what you want to hear from the boss.  I've heard of you.  I've heard of you.  That's perfect.  That's perfect.  At least she doesn't hate me.  I heard of you.  She walked in and she's like, which one is Jim?  I like her.  She didn't pretend.  She's honest.  All right.  Thank you.  You pointed out my failure on television.  There she goes.  But thank you. 
[02:09:30]  Old Mrs. Brady haircut.  Who's that?  June Lockhart?  Hey, do the Brady Brady.  June Lockhart.  What is the Brady music when he goes?  Oh, yeah.  Like, weird wah, wah, wah, wah.  When all of the CBS people came in here, they all turned and looked at me.  I think they all thought I was Jim.  I think so.  Because the camera was kind of on me.  And they were all smiling at me.  Oh, jeez.  No, I'm not.  They barely pay attention.  It's not me.  No, but you're our idea right now of a big celebrity get for the birthday. 
[02:10:00]  Let's focus on that angle.  Make this the place to be.  I tell you.  Wow.  This has been amazing.  Who's the Rockabilly guy?  Is he from CW11?  Rockabilly.  Oh, that's Doug.  That's Holly Williams.  Doug, come here.  They love your voice.  Come here.  Give some cake.  Doug is our web guy and our...  How you doing?  Doug, Doug, say hello.  This is a web piece.  Doug's cool, man.  Doug's got a good voice.  We'll be playing handball off his hair later.  Why are you making fun of Doug? 
[02:10:30]  Doug is responsible for the Anthelini, Dave and Buster's date.  Yeah.  You set these two up?  Yeah.  You set them up?  You guys set them up.  No, man.  I would never do that.  It was Mick Foley, the wrestler.  Really?  Yeah.  Cupid.  Who would have known?  Voss is really, like, pissed.  I'm not pissed.  No, I just...  Where is Voss?  You know, why can't you just be happy?  Why can't you be happy for your friends?  I'm very happy.  I'm very happy.  Did this dare turn into a relationship? 
[02:11:00]  Nice.  Nice.  It sure did.  Dare.  What?  Oh, man.  Stink.  That's a good one.  Can we have some ice cream cake?  Yeah, we want some.  Oh, Jimmy.  I want some.  You want some ice cream?  What gas I'm going to have, because I'm a little lactose intolerant.  Tee-hee-hee.  Yeah.  It's going to be problems.  And I'm sitting next to you.  That is going to reek.  All right, let's get out of here.  I hate to end this one.  Oh, yeah, look at this.  This has been terrific.  This is just a classic.  Oh, happy birthday to Jimmy. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, look, a piece of cake.  What time are you guys in?  Oh, man.  We can wrap up the segment with me eating my cake.  Making funny things.  Thank you.  Awesome.  All right, Rich Voss, where are you going to be?  We've got to do plugs here.  Trump Marina, tomorrow night.  Rich Voss.  Nice, boss.  Louie, where are you going to be?  Can we do the plugs after we get off the air?  Yeah.  Do them on the way over when there's no microphones.  Oh, Louie, you've got to be on a plane, huh?  Zany's Nashville tonight and tomorrow?  Nice.  And then Sunday I'm in Newport at the whatever tent at the yacht or something. 
[02:12:00]  It's a comedy series they do there in Newport, Rhode Island.  That's Sunday night.  Godfrey.  I'm local.  I ain't going anywhere.  Comedy Cellar.  That's right.  All week.  Do it.  Yeah.  I want to thank Jill Nicolini, the CW11.  Thank you.  The Rockabilly Dude.  Basil Teas, Hooper Avenue, Tom's River for the omelets, the food.  Come on.  Oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop.  The food was excellent.  Yeah, Basil Teas were rocks.  Of course, CBS. 
[02:12:30]  Well, the sales guys, we thank them for not coming in here with their dumb ties.  Put your ties back on.  Yeah.  And Roland for just pulling out all stops and getting Bob Levy and Florentine.  Florentine.  I mean, I don't know how you got those guys.  It's just unbelievable, huh, Jerry?  Colin.  They're two comedians who you can actually look up in the phone book.  Wait, and there's one more surprise guest.  Yeah.  One more surprise guest at XM.  What are they?  Did you get me Chuck Nice?  Did you get Chuck Nice?  Actually, he said he may stop by, but that's not the surprise. 
[02:13:00]  Chuck Nice.  I know.  I love Chuck Nice.  I want to discuss his alcoholism.  Every time you see him, you're like, Chuck, keep it down.  It's good to see you, baby.  All right.  We got to get out of here.  We're off to XM.  Have a great weekend.  My God.  We got a crowd today, my friends. 
[02:13:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show at XM Satellite Radio.  I certainly do.  We got easily 100 people here.  Easily.  We got Rich Vos in the studio, Louis C.K.  We got Jimmy in the hallway.  We got...  Can Jimmy hear us yet?  Jimmy!  I hope not.  We're going to let him in.  He can't hear right now?  All right.  We got Sabra Kadabra here, ready to play for Jimmy. 
[02:14:00]  Jimmy has no idea.  Yeah.  That's going to be cool as hell.  And we got Dana White on the phone from the UFC who wants to wish Jimmy a very happy birthday.  Well, let's bring in the birthday boy.  CW11 also made the walk over with us.  Oh, everyone is so excited to see the birthday boy.  Oh, thank you.  Look at this.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Hey, boys.  How are you?  It's Sabra Kadabra.  Yes, it is.  Sabra Kadabra.  So happy.  Sabra Kadabra for Jimmy.  Jimmy, take the special birthday chair today.  Which is the birthday chair?  That's the birthday chair.  I like the birthday chair.  Yeah.  How's he supposed to do the show from that chair?  Now, Jimmy, we were going to go with the big Sabra Kadabra, and they were going to start  playing right away, but we got Dana White on the phone.  He wants to wish you a happy birthday from the UFC.  Oh, okay.  And he only has a few minutes, so let's do this first, and then we're going to get Sabra 
[02:15:00]  Kadabra to play some tunes for you.  Dana.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Dana White from the UFC, of course.  How are you, sir?  I'm great.  How are you guys doing?  Good, man.  How are you?  It's Jimmy's birthday.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, thanks, man.  Hey, thanks for taking care of me and Bob Kelly when we were out there.  Dude, I had a really great time.  It was the first fight I ever went to.  It was the Rampage Jackson-Forrest Griffin fight, and it was amazing, dude.  Pleasure.  I'm glad.  You know, did you see on the internet they were putting out that you're dating Mandy Moore  because you were sitting right next to her? 
[02:15:30]  I know.  You should have seen me.  I saw the Fox cameras ready to go to Mandy Moore, and you've never seen someone sit down  and look straight ahead faster than me.  And that's why dumb Bob, you see half his stomach in most of those pictures, too, because  he has no television instincts whatsoever.  I mean, my only criticism was, I went to the after party, and it was a good time in the  club, but a few more chicks next time.  It was just like every Opie Anthony event.  It was like 50 guys and one girl.  Yeah, that's true.  That's what the UFC after parties are usually like, unfortunately. 
[02:16:00]  And they can't compete with those alpha males.  It's like the accused.  Yeah, I don't know how it is.  It couldn't have...  How come God didn't stand up?  Why aren't you going to sit down?  Yeah, sit down somewhere.  Just grab a seat.  Yeah, yeah, sit down.  Why are we making the black man stand?  Yeah, why the black man stand?  What the hell is that about?  Damn it.  Little Bob about to win.  We thought you were the waiter.  Hey, Dana.  Yeah.  Jesus.  It's really loud in here, but I...  You know, he's our pal, Rampage Jackson.  What do we know? 
[02:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  Is he all right?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he's all right, yeah.  I mean, when the thing happened, it made no sense to me whatsoever.  I mean, I've known him for a long time.  He's a good guy.  And then once I went out there, you know, I was there when he got out, and then it all  made sense.  He actually went yesterday.  He's been checked into a hospital for psych evaluation.  Did he have a...  Was it...  Did that loss really hurt him, man?  Because he looked...  I saw him at the press conference afterwards.  I mean, you can never tell how much physical injury somebody has. 
[02:17:00]  But did that loss really affect him badly?  It must have.  I mean, I don't know what he's going through right now.  It's...  You know, like I said, this guy's a friend of mine.  He's a good guy.  Yeah, he's a funny guy, too.  Yeah, we love when he comes on our show, and...  Yeah, he's awesome.  Something obviously snapped in him, because it just didn't seem like it was part of his  character that we knew.  Yeah, no, it's not.  It's not a part of his character at all.  He's a good guy, and that's why I said it made no sense to me.  And then once I went down and met and talked with him, it absolutely made sense to me then. 
[02:17:30]  Why?  Did it just seem like he was not the same guy you knew?  Yeah, totally.  And it wasn't...  It didn't seem to you at least like it was anything that had been taken?  It just seemed like something that somebody had mentally just had like a real rough time?  Let me tell you, it was so crazy.  They took him when they tried to check him in, you know, book him.  They took him to the hospital instead to get checked out.  And obviously, one of the things they do is drug test you. 
[02:18:00]  Right.  You know, and he wasn't on drugs.  Rampage doesn't do drugs.  Did he get hit too hard or any of that crap, or is it...  You know what, he became born again, like about 2003.  Yeah.  And, you know, he started going on some crazy fasting thing after the fight and didn't drink  anything but water and energy drinks for like four or five days.  Wow.  Yeah.  And didn't sleep a lot and, you know, pretty crazy. 
[02:18:30]  So...  So he's getting checked out as we speak, huh?  No, he's literally in the hospital.  He's been in the hospital since yesterday.  How long is he going to be in there?  I don't know.  Who knows?  And how about...  Because it was really a great fight.  I mean, Rampage got kicked in, I think, the second round.  It was such a devastating kick that he was actually hobbling.  To see him hobbling was kind of unsettling.  And then he spent the whole second round on his back just trying to keep Forrest, you know,  kind of...  Just to kind of recover. 
[02:19:00]  But I actually thought he won the fight.  I mean, I was really close.  Rogan disagrees, though.  Rogan thought that Forrest took it.  What is Forrest's next fight?  We don't know yet.  We don't know when he'll fight again.  But my partner, Lorenzo, had it a draw.  I had it even going into the last round, and I gave the last round to Forrest.  Right.  It was a close fight.  I mean, either way, the only thing...  What was really bad was you could go...  Rampage won the fight.  It was a draw.  Or Forrest won the fight.  I mean, that's how a lot of people feel. 
[02:19:30]  But the scoring, where Forrest won by two rounds and stuff like that, is crazy.  It was terrible, yeah.  Because especially when you're taking a champion's belt, and you know what I mean?  It's got to be kind of like a...  Maybe they just didn't like Rampage, or even if they gave it to Forrest, you're right.  I thought the scoring was a little bit anti-Quentin.  I couldn't agree with you more.  That's why I always tell these guys, you know what you do to keep that from happening?  Don't let it go to the scorecards.  Don't give the judges an opportunity to do that to you.  Yeah, well, I think he had said that, too, in the pre-fight stuff, that he wasn't going 
[02:20:00]  to let it go all the way, and unfortunately for him, it did.  You know, laying off for nine months is kind of tough, but Rampage is so strong.  I mean, he really...  You could see he was really hurting Griffin, I guess, the third and the fourth round in  that fight.  Absolutely.  I felt bad for him to see him lose it, but...  And then he's got that power when he got caught in that submission, and how he just  picks guys right up.  And then he was getting ready to slam Forrest, and Forrest stood up, remember?  Yeah, Rampage picked him up, because Rogan said he had grappled once with Rampage, and 
[02:20:30]  he said he's so strong that he just picked him up like a child off the ground and was  going to slam him.  Of course, he didn't, because they were just kind of grappling around in practice.  Right.  It's amazing.  He really is a powerful guy.  And Liddell had gotten hurt when he was supposed to fight in England.  He's fighting where?  In Atlanta?  Yeah, he's fighting in Atlanta now in September.  Can we go?  We would love to.  Hope, do you want to go?  Yeah, I want to go.  You guys are in.  Whenever you guys want to go to a fight, it's done.  You guys are in.  You got it.  And, Dane, I want to explain again.  You invited all of us to the Vegas thing, and I had a family vacation that was planned 
[02:21:00]  months in advance, and I was dying knowing that Jimmy was out there with Bob Kelly having  a great time.  So I want to go to the Atlanta one, man.  Yeah, no, Don, you guys can go whenever you want to.  Whenever you're ready to come to a fight, you're in.  Oh, that's cool.  Well, I wanted to go to the Vegas one, but nobody told me.  I'm invited.  Rich Voss, thank you.  Leech.  So who is Chuck fighting in September?  He's fighting Rashad Evans.  Now, if he wins that, obviously people want to see Liddell. 
[02:21:30]  I mean, I think he's the biggest name in UFC.  I mean, I don't think I'm being really in knowledge saying that.  Yeah.  What are the odds of him fighting Griffin if Griffin wins his first defense?  They're definitely both big stars.  If he beat Rashad Evans, yeah, you could definitely see a Forrest Griffin, Chuck Liddell fight.  That would be nice.  I mean, Liddell's been around for a long time, so I'd like to see him get the belt before  he decides to, you know, whatever he decides to return.  How many more years do you think Liddell has? 
[02:22:00]  I don't know.  It's a tough question, you know, because Couture, you know, has lasted, you know.  He's 44 years old.  Chuck Liddell is 38, and I'll tell you what, his next couple of fights will probably tell  the tale.  One of my new favorite human beings, and I didn't like him until when he knocked out  Crow Cup, but Gonzaga is a savage.  Isn't he?  He really is.  You can't book him on headline fight, because literally, what was it, a minute and a half  into the first round, he's just got a foot like a mule, and didn't he break Randy's 
[02:22:30]  arm, and Randy's still on the fight?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Man.  He broke his arm kicking it.  Yeah.  He kicked him and broke his arm.  So that guy, is he got a long future in the UFC, I hope?  He is.  He's unbelievable, because Gonzaga is a beast.  You know, I thought that that guy was going to dominate the heavyweight division for a  long time, you know, and he's had a couple of setbacks, but you're right.  When he fights, the guy comes out to absolutely destroy you.  How did he, did he lose just due to inexperience? 
[02:23:00]  I mean, he's got 8-11 fights.  He's 8-3.  I mean, yeah.  Yeah, I think it was.  I think it was an experience.  You know, time's going to tell with this guy.  We saw what he did to Crow Cop.  We saw what he did in the last fight, and he's done that to a lot of people that he's  fought.  But he's a very, very tough guy, very well-rounded.  I think it's an experience factor for him right now.  And last time you called, you were very comfortable.  You were shitting on Fedor.  I mean, he's fighting tomorrow night.  Do you think he's just overrated, or do you think he's going to murder who he's fighting? 
[02:23:30]  Well, I think that Fedor, you know, in his day, was a great fighter, could be considered  a great fighter.  He hasn't fought anybody since 2005.  You know what I mean?  Everybody talks about, oh, Fedor, it's 2008.  He hasn't fought anybody since 2005.  Who do you like in the British Open?  They should get a little extreme golf going on.  Hey, Dana, when are you going to get into the New York market? 
[02:24:00]  We're working on that right now.  What the fuck is taking so long, man?  I know it's not you, but it's still illegal in New York, right?  Yeah, we've been working on it for a long time.  I thought we'd be in there this year.  It's not looking like we're going to be in there until next year now.  New York and Massachusetts are two states that aren't done yet.  Jesus.  Ridiculous.  Crazy.  It is ridiculous.  Dana, how hard are you going to get when the call comes that you can bring the UFC to  Madison Square Garden?  Oh, yeah.  We're pumped, man. 
[02:24:30]  Both.  I want to do Madison Square Garden and the Boston Garden.  I'm excited for both of them.  You guys will sell them both out, too, because people know that they're the last two holdouts.  It's just that the people who are involved in boxing and the garden are so deeply entrenched.  And, of course, no one would ever imply corruption in Boston.  I mean, that's just a coincidence that the same fucking people have been there since 1940.  Exactly.  Fucking bush-mouthed asshole that guy is.  But you guys will get in.  I mean, it's a legitimate sport everywhere.  So you'll certainly get in.  I've got to ask Dana one more question.  What is the last really rich thing you did? 
[02:25:00]  Really rich thing?  Yeah, this guy loves spending his money and having fun with it.  Oh, my God.  Actually, I don't act like a rich asshole, to be honest with you.  No, I know that, but...  I don't.  You know, the last probably crazy thing that I did with my money that I'm probably going to be MC Hammer in about four years.  But I'm going to be on VH1 going, I had it all.  I had cars and money, and now I'm broke.  About ten years ago, I went to this summer concert festival, and Joan Jett and the Blackhearts played. 
[02:25:30]  And Joan Jett was so badass.  I was blown away by how good she was.  You know, I was never a huge Joan Jett fan.  Yeah, I love rock and roll.  It's a great song and stuff.  I saw her play, and I was blown away by her.  And so about a month and a half ago, I rented out the Viper Room in L.A.  and had Joan Jett and the Blackhearts come play there for me and a few of my friends.  That's nice.  What another dime in a jukebox, baby.  You want to do something crazy, though?  You want to spend money properly, man? 
[02:26:00]  When you're in Atlanta, you buy a hooker for Jim Norton.  That's right.  That's a great way to spend money.  That's right.  If you're rich, you've got to do those things.  Yeah, of course.  Flush bars of gold down the toilet.  You just got to do rich things.  Dana White knows how to do rich things.  Well, Dana, thanks a lot, man.  And thanks so much for taking such good care of us.  I told you in person, I saw you, but usually you get the people yes you to death,  but we were taken care of better than anybody ever has.  So it's really appreciated.  Let me jump in, Dana. 
[02:26:30]  Jimmy came back.  He couldn't believe how well you took care of him and Bob Kelly.  It was just over the top.  Over the top.  You guys were just a class act.  No, my pleasure, man.  I appreciate it.  Let me tell you what.  Thank you.  I appreciate you guys giving us the support.  And right back at you, man.  Anytime you guys want to come to an event, you're in.  All right.  We'll see you with the Liddell fight in Atlanta.  Absolutely.  Awesome.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, man.  Take care, Dana.  Dana White from the UFC.  Jimmy's birthday.  Yeah.  Jimmy's birthday.  What is he? 
[02:27:00]  Does he run the...  He's the ball guy.  Yeah.  He's an animal.  Hey, Bosh.  He's the guy.  He's the ball guy.  Hey, listen.  I would have liked to have asked him about Bob Levy and Danny Bondaducci.  What are his odds on that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, these guys have been standing there with instruments in their hands for literally 45  minutes.  Really?  I'm sorry, guys.  We got Sabra Cadabra in studio.  They're playing tomorrow at the Surf Club in Ortley Beach, New Jersey, 1900 Ocean Avenue,  732-793-6625. 
[02:27:30]  If you want to see Sabra Cadabra.  But for Jimmy's birthday, they're going to take over for a little bit.  Yeah.  They fucking are an amazing Black Sabbath cover band, and they sing fucking...  They sound like Old Sabbath.  It's fucking...  It's great.  You guys doing all right?  Well, your mic should be on.  Is your mic on, bro?  Yeah.  I can barely hear you.  Oh, no.  His mic's on.  I got the mic on.  Good.  Joe, is your mic on?  He was speaking to... 
[02:28:00]  Cash, money, order.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Why would it work?  Why would it work?  I'm just saying, why would it work?  That studio audience looks like an Aryan Brotherhood meeting out there.  We got to get his...  Hey, can we get Joe a cordless mic?  Can somebody get Joe a cordless mic if that one's not working for me?  How about we leave it?  We'll probably get you number one on that.  At least we talked to Joe on the radio.  Does that one work?  I think gays and...  Try that one.  Just...  Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check.  Oh, hey.  That one's still on. 
[02:28:30]  This one's not.  There's a lot of firings for this.  It's not life.  Hey, by the way, Jimmy, now that we're on XM, this is just, you know, on your birthday,  the day you were born, somebody walking by, what they would have said, watching you be  born, they would have said, hey, look, there's some cunt coming out of some cunt's cunt.  That's what happened 40 years ago today.  You could have said that at TBS. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, on the other one.  Sorry, I can't...  Hey, is this going to work?  Are we going to try a song and see what happens?  Try that one again.  Mars, is this going to work?  Oh, man.  All right, let's see if this is going to work.  Take the wireless mic away from Joe.  Yeah, you should have get these a wireless.  I think they're the ones that are working.  Check it.  Hey, it's getting there.  That one's fine.  Take the wireless mic away from Joe.  Thank you.  Try the big one?  Jesus.  Try the wired mic now, Joe.  Yeah, try that one now. 
[02:29:30]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Nothing.  It's not working much.  They're hearing it in the other room.  Uh-oh.  All right, they're hearing it in the other room.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll give it a try here.  It's Sabra Cadabra for Jim Norton's birthday.  Take it away, guys.  Take it away, guys. 
[02:30:00]  Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, we gotta start over, yeah, why would it work, always a clusterfuck, 
[02:30:30]  I thought it was instrumental, I was like, when are you gonna sing, it was just everything coming through the air mics, I turned off all the air mics, so what's the deal there, what's going on, you were just going, we wanna hear it man, musically it sounded good, but we didn't hear the vocals, I could've done a freestyle rhyme while, and wait for you to jump in, yeah, no, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, 
[02:31:00]  Oh yeah, cause you're black, hold on, that's right, that's what I do, that's God for you, I guess, I like racism, beautiful, what are they doing, and I like that being a big chuckle from that, what happened, Mars, what's going on, look at that, Mars, 
[02:31:30]  Mars, what's going on, well, I'll look over here now, oh, all the buttons pushed right, maybe that one right there, ooh, not that one, maybe, he pushed a button, Jimmy, okay, Joe, just tried, Joe, say something, 
[02:32:00]  Oh, he's way down in the mix, oh, Jesus, what in good God's name, every goddamn time we try, we can never get music correct, every time we do it, there's a technical glitch, a clusterfuck, whether it's here or CBS, well, Jimmy, we got a girl here that wants to give you a birthday gift, so why don't we do that, as we try to figure out the mix,  Alright, now we got to get Sabra Cadabra playing, so maybe the girl can give me a gift, can we at least, what's that, I'm hearing this mic now, 
[02:32:30]  Wait, wait, one, two, it's very loud, wait, wait, can I get one, louder, yes, Jimmy, no, no, that's bleeding, there's something wrong, give him either a regular mic, can you sing it to one of these cordless ones, or no, it's a number, yeah, we can mix it off of our wireless pod,  But why the hell isn't it working, I don't know, it should just be working, of course it should be, 
[02:33:00]  Oh, yeah, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, oh my God, no, Jim, yes, Jim, hi, that's perfect, I can hear you perfectly,  Should we sing with the wireless?  We might as well, what are you...  And now we hear...  Check...  Do it like they used to...  Wow, hey...  It's up to you, Joe, you want to try it again?  Whatever you want to do, we... 
[02:33:30]  Check it one, two, now you can hear me with this one.  Oh, yeah, perfect.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because we can't hear...  Yeah, but if you stand right there and sing right there, I can hear...  Oh, so you want to just stand and sing it to two microphones.  Ozzy used to do that, he would tape them together.  All right, you want to tape that on the other one, maybe?  You got some duct tape?  Did anybody test these, by the way?  Yeah, shouldn't it have all been...  Wait, were these tested before?  Yes, yesterday and this morning.  And they worked.  Yeah.  Okay.  They were tested.  They didn't work, but they were tested. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, no good.  Check it one, two.  What time did you guys get here?  How's that, Jimmy?  That sounds great.  All right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got the tape.  Wait, can you guys hear Joe through that one?  You can only hear him faintly through the wireless.  Yeah, we're going to tape the two microphones and try that there, Jimmy.  Sabracadabra.  Really the fucking best sabracadabra.  You want us responsible for this shit?  What are you guys playing tomorrow night? 
[02:34:30]  Surf Club.  Ocean Avenue.  Whatley Beach.  Everything we've done today has been just a fucking step off, which is kind of perfect  because I'm 40 and I'm languishing in mediocrity.  All right, it's not a victim there, buddy.  Oh, boy.  E-Rock, what are you doing?  Are you not taping it right?  He's probably got the fucking sticky side up.  Pretendos are legs.  Now the mic's too heavy.  Now it's too heavy.  Hey, you want to throw some weights on that? 
[02:35:00]  All right, we're going to try again or what?  Take two.  It's Sabracadabra.  Let's go for Jim Norton's birthday.  Hit it.  Thanks, guys.  Let's go for it. 
[02:35:30]  Let's go for it. 
[02:36:00]  Let's go for it. 
[02:36:30]  Let's go for it. 
[02:37:00]  Let's go for it.  Let's go for it.  Let's go for it.  Let's go for it.  Let's go for it.  Let's go for it.  Let's go for it.  Let's go for it.  Let's go for it.  Let's go for it.  Let's go for it.  Let's go for it. 
[02:37:30]  Let's go for it.  I'm talking to you, but I know it's not for you, it's another reason why.  And I know it, I understand, but when it's time to die.  I believe the life of us will be the only one.  And if you let, you find the same, you're like a son of a heart. 
[02:38:00]  I want you to live, I'm trying to get through, but I'm still feeling like you.  And I'm talking to you.  And I see the eyes of the light, who make a starry day.  And I look, feeling like you're telling, just to see if life is done. 
[02:38:30]  I've got a life to keep you apart, the secrets that you love.  I'm still feeling like you're telling, just to see if life is done.  And I swear, it is true.  So, if you will have to keep you apart, the secrets that you're telling, just to see if life is done.  guitar solo

[02:41:00]  Yes!  Whoa!  Sabra Kadabra live  for Jim Norton's birthday.  The fucking best  Sabbath cover band.  Joe sounds like fucking Ozzy  in 1969 and they fucking do  all the obscure shit, man.  I love you guys.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Thank you, man.  By the way, Nelson Mandela's  birthday is today, too.  I like the fact that CNN is  covering that shit  instead of my birthday.  What the fuck has he done?  What has he done besides 
[02:41:30]  break the law?  He's been good lately, though.  The budding skate.  You know, he's...  He learned his lesson  being in jail.  He did.  27 years.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's the song Jimmy used  to walk on stage to,  by the way.  Yeah, I actually...  Yeah, fucking National Acrobat  off of fucking Sabbath,  bloody Sabbath.  And I actually had to go  to Sabbath to get permission  to use that my HBO special  to walk out with.  They had to go to each  individual band member  and they gave it to me  dirt cheap.  Like, they knocked  all the money off  and the publisher still  wanted a little bit of money.  We had to get approval  from all the band members. 
[02:42:00]  Jimmy...  They fucking...  They approved it.  We're gonna get another song  from Sabra Kadabra  in a minute,  but we got another  celebrity calling in  for your birthday.  Okay.  This is a biggie.  Hello, sir.  Let me get the...  Michael.  Hello.  Michael K. Williams.  Hey, what's happening?  Michael?  Yes.  Jimmy's gonna freak.  Omar from The Wire.  Holy shit.  Get out of here.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Don't hold of them.  Don't get scared. 
[02:42:30]  It ain't a hold of them.  I ain't got my shotgun.  Yo.  The baddest actor.  I come in peace, man.  Actually,  is Jimmy in the building?  I'm right here, man.  Yeah, you did it.  Yo, Jimmy, man.  I was called this morning.  Wish you a blessing.  Happy birthday, man.  You know what I mean?  Enjoy this day.  May you have many more.  Thank you, man.  You know, it's amazing.  We tried so hard  to get you on the show.  I'm a tremendous  wire fan.  Everybody here is.  I'm starstruck  for the first time in a while.  It's the best show on TV.  For sure.  For sure it is. 
[02:43:00]  You, Michael.  I cannot wait  till August  for the last DVD set, man.  Me, too.  Do you know...  Oh, where is it coming?  You got more information than me?  It's coming out in August?  In August, man.  I was waiting in, like,  in March, yo.  I was like, yo.  I was in Barzanova like,  yo, when is the last  wire shit coming out, son?  I gotta see what Omar's  about to do.  Yo, shit, shit.  They're like everybody else  and T-Vo'd them.  They kept more  on the door on the box.  You gotta know  better people.  I got the last season around.  No, you don't.  Oh, yeah, man. 
[02:43:30]  I'm firing off you right now.  Yo, yo, let me burn  them shits, yo.  Hey, Michael,  when did you know  they were gonna kill you?  Did they tell you  in the beginning  of the season  or did you find out  as the time came?  I mean,  I knew Omar was gonna die  from the day I was hired.  Yeah, I mean,  they told me  initially only  it's supposed to be  seven episodes  and we'll kill him off then.  But then, you know,  they kept, you know,  the character grew  and they grew  to, you know,  the writers,  they kept, you know,  developing him.  But I always knew 
[02:44:00]  from day one  that they were gonna  kill off Omar.  Hey, this is Rich Voss,  Big Act of Comedy Central,  last comedy setting.  Is it true  that the little girl  on the show  was really  just walking by  and they hired her?  She was really  just like a street person?  She's not a little girl.  You know what I'm saying?  It's time.  You're talking about  probably Felicia.  Her name is Felicia Pearson.  She plays Snoop  and we met actually  in a local bar  down in Baltimore  and, you know,  we exchanged 
[02:44:30]  a conversation  and when she told me  I didn't know  she was a female  I was trying to figure out  as I was talking to her  and when she told me  she was a female  I was like,  man, you know,  you gotta meet the producers  and I brought them to her  that Monday  and she was,  they wrote her in  that same week  and she's been rocking  ever since.  That's unbelievable.  That's a trippy looking  dude, chick,  chick, dude,  whatever.  She was hard to, man.  You know what I'm saying?  This is Godfrey.  I'm talking,  I have more credits to Rich. 
[02:45:00]  Commercials, commercials.  Rich Voss again,  first white guy  in Def Jam  and I just came.  Yeah, he did do it in Def Jam.  Do you know,  hold on,  you're the first white guy  that did Def Jam.  We interviewed Russell Simmons.  He didn't fucking remember you.  Well, it was 10 years ago.  Yeah, we forgot to bring that up there, Rich.  It was 10 years ago.  10 years ago,  we gave them all hints,  we gave them a name,  we did everything.  We're all kind of friends.  Weren't you in the Hulk, yo?  Yeah, for like five seconds.  For five seconds, right?  He was in the Hulk.  Yeah.  But I had a bigger scene, though.  They cut it out for some reason, man.  They had like dialogue and everything. 
[02:45:30]  Me and the Hulk had to sit down.  They didn't want you to shoot the Hulk  with a double-barrel shotgun,  that's right.  How was it playing a cop?  Nah, nah, negative, negative,  negative, you know what I mean?  Hey, how was it playing a cop?  What was that?  Don Baby Gone, right?  Don Baby Gone, yeah.  It was weird seeing you as a cop.  That was a lot of fun, man.  You know, Ben Affleck,  he's really cool to work with.  I can't wait to work with him again, actually.  But it was dope, you know,  down there in Boston.  You know, we was down there  when I think Italy won the soccer cup, 
[02:46:00]  the World Cup for the soccer tournament, man.  That shit was crazy down there.  Yeah, he got a ball.  Can I tell you,  when you got shot,  I'm 40 years old today.  If they would have just said  at the end of the episode,  all right, we take it back,  he's alive,  I would have accepted it.  I have never been so depressed.  Yeah.  And fucking David Chase  kicked everybody in the balls.  Yeah.  It wasn't a big gunfight  we were expecting.  It wasn't a big war  with you and Jamie Hector.  It was just, yeah.  Yeah, Jamie Hector.  Just you getting shot 
[02:46:30]  because that's the way it happens.  Yeah.  And even the cops' reaction,  it wasn't like fans.  They were like,  yeah, Omar, oh, okay.  And they moved on.  It was fucking horrible.  Yeah, it was horrible.  That was a bummer, man.  Really depressing, man.  Yeah, it kind of got me  a little bit to, you know,  when actually the day of,  you know, it was,  you know, but I guess,  you know,  a character like that,  it had to go out like that,  you know.  Yo, Mike, can you do it?  That's for sure.  What's the whistle you did, man?  Every time I try to say,  what were you whistling every time?  What was you whistling  every time you were whistling 
[02:47:00]  in the neighborhood?  Most people think it's  the Farmer and the Dell  because, you know,  the cheese stands alone.  Yeah.  But actually,  in my mind,  what I'm whistling  is another Looney Tunes cartoon  by a character named Elmer Fudd.  And he used to whistle,  a hunting we will go.  A hunting we will go.  It's rabbit season.  Remember that little bit?  Nice.  Yeah, that was hot, man.  So that's for Omar B. Whistling. 
[02:47:30]  He was saying,  I'm a fight.  I'm a fight.  A hunting we will go.  Hey, are you frustrated?  Because once again,  it's almost like a running joke  that fucking disgraceful  the Emmys are.  Yeah.  That they don't,  not only is The Wire never won,  you guys have never been nominated  for an Emmy, correct?  Yes.  Correct.  It's disgraceful.  It's so obvious  that it's something other  than the merit of the show  because everybody who sees it  knows it's the best show  on television.  It's fucking brilliantly acted.  The writing was brilliant.  The storylines were brilliant. 
[02:48:00]  Even the way they took you out,  which was just,  it was just,  like the drug,  you get covered up with the sheet  and that's the end of it.  We as the audience  invested so much love and time  and in the end,  it was just dead  in another number.  I mean,  Amazing.  The Emmys  should be fucking firebombed  for never recognizing you.  Yeah, they should be.  Michael,  what do you think  that's all about?  You know,  I don't,  you know,  I don't try to plug into it.  If I go too hard,  it'll lead me to start  questioning myself  as an actor  and I know clearly 
[02:48:30]  it has nothing to do  with me.  I know it's political,  but,  you know,  I will say,  you know,  it did,  it did hurt.  It did kind of like,  it stunned me a little bit  this year.  I got,  you know,  kind of pierced my armor.  Normally,  I don't pay any attention  to the other years,  but for some reason,  I'm this year,  because I know  there's no next year,  I guess.  It kind of,  it hurt a little bit this year.  You know,  I got myself here wondering  what did we not do correctly  to earn,  you know,  to be worthy  of a nomination, 
[02:49:00]  but I know  in my heart of hearts  it has nothing to do  with us as actors  or our talent  or the hard work  that we put down  in Baltimore  and you guys  let me know that.  You know what I'm saying?  The amount of love  and admiration  I've gotten over the years  in this character  from just people,  whether you be in the business,  whether you're an interviewer  or not,  just the amount of love  we've gotten,  I know that the show  was worthy  of that.  You guys make me know that  and I take all the love  and all the fun  I've had to just talk 
[02:49:30]  and do interviews  and talking about  all the crazy things  I had to talk about  involving Omar.  I've had a ball  these past five years  and to me,  I'm going to take  those good memories  and I'm going to make  that my Emmy.  You know what I mean?  I keep it moving.  That's what it is.  And Mike?  Big skin, baby.  Michael.  Here for the long haul.  I'm assuming that  you're just completely  blowing up  after your performance  on The Wire.  You've got to be  getting a million offers.  You guys did.  I'll take that.  I'll take that.  Yeah.  Come too far  to turn back now.  You know what I mean?  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  Turn too far.  Yeah, I'll take that.  What was it?  Six episodes you said  you were supposed to do?  They just had you  as a peripheral character  and then all of a sudden  the character  was just so interesting  and there was this whole,  it was like a Robin Hood  in a weird way  but it wasn't  a hokey Robin Hood.  It was a believable guy  who just had  a set of morals  and a code  that he lived by  but happened to carry  a shotgun  and fucking steal dope.  Yeah.  And the thing is  you like men  and I was like  oh this dude's kissing dude  he is the baddest  homosexual ever.  I want to be gay 
[02:50:30]  with a shotgun son.  You know Michael  the kissing  the kissing was definitely  a little rough  but  when Michael K  kisses  he's a whole different  ball game.  What do you say Michael?  I said it was rough  for you imagine  what I had to deal with  man  in my career  I would say  here lies  on Michael K  Williams  his first  on screen camera  kiss was with  another man.  You know what  I would assume  your boys  are like  they give you 
[02:51:00]  a little  something something  for that huh?  I mean  in the first year  when the initial  shock  when it first hit  it was like  yo  what are you doing?  Hey let me tell you  for a scene  on that show  I would  let him finish  his fucking  you know  by the second  third season  I think everybody  pretty much  had forgotten about it  actually became so  it became like  for what  matter of fact  after  like by the third season  no one was talking  about that.  I think by the 
[02:51:30]  middle of the first season  people  like once people  saw it  and got used to it  the character  who you were  overtook it  and it didn't matter  nobody gave a shit  that was just like  a peripheral  or a separate  personality trait  the main thing  was that when  Omar showed up  with that long  coat no matter  how warm it was  out  and a  sawed off shotgun  there was going  to be a problem  and I think  that's what  people focused  on.  Oh man.  I think  that's absolutely  correct.  I think at the end  of the day  I told people  you know  the last thing  you're going to  remember Omar  for is 
[02:52:00]  who he went  to bed with  you know  which is the way  it should be  in real life  you know  but  yeah  boss wanted  to ask you  something  no forget  I fucked up  what did you  fuck up?  I'm sorry  that Godfrey  cut you off  and it was  my mistake  this is  my wife  is like  a little  white girl  from Canada  and it's also  her favorite  show on TV  it's just  I just want to  say you brought  a lot of  enjoyment 
[02:52:30]  into our lives  we would watch  the show  and it was  like a drug  for us  we would do  three or four  episodes a night  we couldn't  stop watching  it  we're all  making the  same uncomfortable  face at Rich  that you're  making listening  to him  when he says  when he says  I know you  love the show  I always tell  everybody  the wires  get the wire  you do  I'm like a  fucking publicist  for the wires  you are a big fan  Rich you really  added a lot  that's all we're  saying  I just made a  mistake before  I cut him off  by action  you added a lot  I don't mind  nah nah  it don't cut off 
[02:53:00]  but listen man  it's been a good  ride  we had fun  we had fun  down in Baltimore  and that's  what we do  my issue  wasn't  hey Jimmy  guess what  I'll tell you  this  guess who  guess who's  birthday was  yesterday  from the cast  I don't know  I'm gonna go  with Bubz  Wood Harris  wow  Bubz  good answer  that's  Audrey Royale's  birthday was  yesterday  who said that  Audrey  Audrey Royale  I hope he got  that but I  was thinking  it  I don't know

Remember that scene?  What a bunch of unprofessional fucking zeros.  We all turned into fanboys.  Yeah, it was great.  That was pretty cool, man.  Yeah.  I didn't feel bad about that one.  No, he was great, though.  He was really cool, too.  He's really humble.  He's real shit.  Yeah, absolutely.  Louis C.K.?  What's up, Louis?  He's taking a big, long shit.  It's Michael K.  And now it's Louis C.K.  Who is here?  Who is Omar? 
[03:09:00]  From The Wire?  Oh, is that who?  Yeah, I fucking know that dude.  But the shotgun and shit?  You know him?  Was he here?  No, he was on the phone.  Fucking Louis.  How do you know him?  He was in the movie I wrote with Chris.  I think I love my movie.  Michael K. Williams, you know?  Wait, he was in that movie?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He plays...  He's in D.C., right?  In D.C.  How about pulling some fucking strings?  I'm a huge fan, Lou.  Pulling some strings for what?  I don't know.  To get him in studio.  You're a fan, but I don't like you, so there's no connection there.  Nice.  Fair enough. 
[03:09:30]  You see?  We should have got the invite...  We need all pieces.  We should have got the invite to Omar's block party that's happening in Jersey.  I didn't almost say that, but are we going to go to Newark and like...  Fuck.  He's in Newark?  He's in Newark?  I don't know where he is.  I don't like how his numbers.  It's just that he was in a movie I wrote and I met him once.  I don't know him.  Yeah.  He was nice to me.  The block party.  Wait, do you think it's in Princeton?  Of course it's in Newark.  I don't know if it's in Newark.  Yeah.  Newark is not a joke, man.  It's on Bel Air.  You were really on the Apollo?  Yeah.  Three times. 
[03:10:00]  Russell Simmons didn't remember.  Dance them off.  Dance them.  There's 200 comics that did depth in it.  Hold on.  We got the clip.  We asked Russell Simmons about you.  I saw him.  Shut up.  We're going to play the clip.  Here's the clip.  You just said it ten times.  We're going to play your clip.  Let's go.  Let's embarrass Rich Voss.  Do you know Rich Voss?  Who is that?  Spectacular.  Good.  There's a guy.  We just made our day.  We just made our day.  Rich Voss.  We're going to end with a light note here.  He was the first white comic on Def Jam. 
[03:10:30]  Really?  I want to hug him.  This is great.  I've never been happier.  Rich has done nothing but pound this down our throats forever.  He's a friend of the show.  Steve Harvey was guest hosting.  Yeah.  Really?  And Rich Voss, I don't know if he was first.  No, he was.  He says, he's been saying.  Was he?  He was first.  He got introduced as that.  Steve Harvey introduced him as that.  And afterwards, it was very funny.  After Voss was finished, he goes, all right, now we're even.  Like, you know, Voss.  Shit has happened.  But yeah.  There's a picture of him, Russell.  I've never seen him before.  Oh, that's bad. 
[03:11:00]  Voss, you zero.  You're nothing, Rich.  You stink.  Russell doesn't remember you as the first white guy in the show.  I've got a bad memory.  Maybe that was.  No.  No.  You have a great memory.  No, you don't.  Leave me.  You have a perfect memory.  Oh, I'm so happy.  I love you on Google.  Everyone's on Google.  Google horse shit.  I guarantee it.  Rich Voss comes up.  And here we are back live.  There you go, Rich.  We had Russell in and we asked him about you.  Google horse shit.  Yeah.  Funny as hell.  Showed him a picture.  Everything.  What did you do, Deb Camp? 
[03:11:30]  I never did.  Okay, the black guy.  So hot.  That's all right.  Wow, you really got Godfrey.  Yeah, you really got me.  We really got him with that one.  We talked about it earlier.  He's on every other commercial on TV.  You really got him with that one.  So Scott LaRose, look where he is now.  Scott LaRose.  Ugh.  All right, we got Godfrey in studio.  We got Louis C.K. in studio.  Sabra Kadabra.  Yeah.  Jim Norton's birthday and a big surprise after the break.  I have to tinkle.  I hope nobody minds.  Well, make sure he doesn't see the big surprise.  Hide whatever the surprise is because Jim has to tinkle. 
[03:12:00]  Well, we want to make piss come out of his cock.  We want to do the big reveal live on the show, so stay there.  On his birthday.  This is Dr. Phil.  Even without the yellow treats and the trannies and the crinkle, crinkle paper bags on the  feet and rest stop men's rooms, what we have here with this Norton character is a child's  garden of perversion and dysfunction.  You do know that, right?  I mean, Monster Rain?  What the hell ever happened just playing Cowboys and Indians, huh?  Or stickball or candy land for Christ's sake? 
[03:12:30]  Happy Jimmy Day to the funniest, most talented comic working today.  Not you!  Why would we come back?  What is it?  Come on, baby!  Huh?  Oh, my...  Oh, way through that.  Ah, God!  Nothing's going right.  Problem?  Why the fuck would we come back with this? 
[03:13:00]  Why not?  This is the fucking surprise guest, you asshole!  No one would know.  Why else would we play Chubby Checker coming out of a break?  I don't know.  You got a Chubby Checker coming in a few minutes, Jimmy.  Anyway, welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  What?  I think he might have just thought it was an obscure kind of song.  Fuck no.  Come back with?  What, after four years of satellite radio, we're going to come back with a Chubby Checker 
[03:13:30]  fucking...  We've done that.  No, we haven't!  Oh, yeah.  Ever!  Jimmy's not stupid.  He is.  We go to break saying we got a very special guest for Jim Norton, and then the first thing  you hear before we go live is a Chubby Checker song.  Would you have put two and two together there?  What?  Bring Club Soda Kenny in here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show celebrating Jim Norton's birthday. 
[03:14:00]  We got a huge crowd outside.  You guys having fun or what?  They're in the darkness.  For some reason, we decided to turn the lights down, so they're just shadows out there.  But, guys, for coming to Jimmy's birthday celebration, we're going to give everybody a pair of tickets  to the Virus Show August 2nd at PNC, Homedale, New Jersey.  Tickets for Ticketmaster.  We got all the guys.  Rich Voss is going to be performing.  Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neill, Bob Kelly, Otto and George, and many, many others. 
[03:14:30]  So, August 2nd is the show, PNC Bank Art Center, but you guys all get a free pair of tickets  to the show.  Also, we got Sabra Cadabra here.  We're going to make believe that Jimmy doesn't know who the surprise guest is because we got  the lovely Jill Nicolini coming back in from the CW.  CW 11.  Where's Jill?  And here he is, Mr. Checker.  Chubby Checker.  It's Chubby Checker.  Oh, hi, I'm Jim. 
[03:15:00]  Thank you.  Happy birthday to Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Chubby Checker.  It's Chubby Checker.  Thank you very much, sir.  Thank you very much.  Why would that mic work?  How does Chubby Checker look so good?  Did the mic not work?  No, it's not working.  The mic doesn't work.  Of course not.  Why would it?  It's been around forever.  Yes.  What's going on?  Yeah, sit down, please.  Do we have an extra?  Hold on.  Do we have to get a mic that works?  There we go.  Thank you so much.  That works. 
[03:15:30]  It's wonderful being here.  Thank you.  You look really good.  For allowing me to be among the dudes.  Thank you.  Just laugh.  Thank you.  To be among the young lions.  That's cool.  Are you on the road or no?  I'm always on the road.  Look on ChubbyChecker.com.  We got gigs all over the place.  In fact, I'm doing the morning show tomorrow on CBS.  And after that, we're going to go to Newark Airport.  I'm going to get on a plane. 
[03:16:00]  I'm going to be in Kansas.  The car's going to pick me up.  I'm going to join the Wildcats.  And we're going to do a gig tomorrow night.  We've got gigs in Virginia on 26.  We're all booked up next August.  How many years have you been doing this?  Since I got out of high school.  I graduated high school in 1960.  While the twist was being played on the radio.  Which is kind of cool.  And in my yearbook, I'm already ChubbyChecker in my year class.  And then when I graduated, the twist was being played on the radio. 
[03:16:30]  And I've been doing On the Road ever since I left high school in 1960.  You were a high school kid and you had a hit record while you were in high school?  I had a song called The Class that was number 34 on the charts when I was in 1958.  When I was like 17.  Did you get mad later in school because of huge amounts of...  It was so cool.  And then in 1959, I thought it was all over.  And then we made this song called Twist. 
[03:17:00]  And we had to campaign this because we had to go around to all these record hops and all these places to get this music played.  And then the kids started seeing the way I did the dance.  And then it kind of caught on.  And then one thing led to another.  And a few radio stations started playing it.  And all the kids started requesting it.  And then Dick Clark brought me on American Bandstand.  And I didn't know at that moment that the life in the music industry and everything that was in music was going to change forever. 
[03:17:30]  It was almost like when Alexander Graham Bell said, Watson, is that you?  Because the very minute that we went on TV and did that song, The Twist, dancing in the world changed forever.  It was never to be the same again.  What came first, a song or the dance?  Actually, Hank Ballard wrote the song and recorded it.  And the radio played the song for a while.  And they stopped playing it.  Radio is still very powerful.  You don't get no play, you get no payday.  Bye-bye.  And The Twist did not get any airplay. 
[03:18:00]  And it was a dead issue.  And the guys at the record company said, Chubby, let's let Chubby do that song on Twist.  Because we really think it's going to be something special.  And they had already did the track and everything.  And Dave Apple says, Chubby, come on in, we're going to do the twist.  I said, David, I says, he says, just come in here and do it.  So I walked from my house all about 20 blocks and went upstairs.  And I already knew the song.  And I sang the song. 
[03:18:30]  And we did, my daddy's sleeping.  And then we finished.  Dave says, Chubby, I want to do it one more time because that daddy's sleeping.  He says, it's a little flat.  I says, David, I'm going to flunk school.  I'm not going to graduate.  My grades are terrible.  I'm going home and do my homework.  And they are never going to know.  And I left the studio.  Little did I know.  But when I went outside the studio, I had a strange kind of feeling, you know. 
[03:19:00]  And I said, ah, you know, but we didn't know that it was going to be the only song that  became number one twice since God put man on the planet.  We didn't know that in the 60s, there was the Beatles and Elvis and the British invasion  and Woodstock and Jimi Hendrix and all the rest of the stuff that happened.  Motown, the twist is the number one song of the entire 60s.  So you're in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  So happy birthday, Jimmy. 
[03:19:30]  But that will come.  How are you not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, Chubby, you have to tell them what's happening Wednesday.  Wednesday at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  We're going to be at the FYE Record Store at 630.  It's going to be a free concert there.  And I'm debuting my new song, Knock Down the Walls.  Now, you guys, you won't believe it when you hear it because it's like, it's like nothing  that you'd ever expect from the Chubb, but it's the 21st century Chubby Chucker. 
[03:20:00]  And sometimes I have a hard time believing that I even wrote that song, you know, because  the song is so awesome.  Do you get sick of hearing it?  Like, everybody requests the song from 1960.  Are you ever like, because I'm 40 today.  Do you ever like get sick of, like, yeah, people say, all right, that song.  The song changed the world.  And you know something, anyone that goes on the floor and does the boogie to anybody's  music.  Wait, what song changed the world?  The Twist.  All the Twist, right.  I'm not a person. 
[03:20:30]  Do people ever say that you're in better shape than Jacqueline?  I'm looking at you and you're just so tight and he's, no, he's a good kid.  All the people at XM, God is with me.  He's looking after the Chubb, taking care of me.  Did you ever go on those tours, too, with Alan Freed, the doo-wop tours?  You want to know you were in high school when they happened?  It was a little bit for me.  It was right before you, man.  It was a little bit for me.  Jesus, Rick.  What do you think?  He's as old as you?  You know, Alan Freed, you know, he was a pretty great guy, Alan Freed.  That's why the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is in Cleveland, because of Alan Freed. 
[03:21:00]  They got his ashes there.  He's great.  Another Jew.  Good people.  Well, hey.  Mishpucha.  Mishpucha.  Mishpucha.  Hey.  What does that mean?  Family.  Oh, okay.  You can't be a heath and not know that.  A banking term.  I'm not Jewish.  You're not Jewish.  I am.  Rich, Rich, I'm Irish.  I am, and I didn't know what it meant.  He's an Irishman, one of our own birthday.  One of our own.  It's one of our own, lads.  Wow.  Happy birthday, Billy. 
[03:21:30]  One of our own, lads.  That's pretty good.  You ought to hear Bob do his English accent.  Good grief.  So the new song is debuting when?  On the 22nd.  The official release is on the 22nd.  We're going to debut at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 630.  That's a Wednesday.  It's a free concert.  It's in the FYE Record Store.  I want everybody to come there.  It's because we're going to kick some butt there.  We always kick butt.  We do that.  Chubby, we've had a very odd selection of guests today. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, we sure have.  We have had Sabra Kadabra, who's a Black Sabbath cover band.  I'm sure you're a Sabbath fan.  Yeah.  And yourself, of course.  And Michael K. Williams from The Wire.  And, of course, Louis C.K.  Yes.  It's been a very weird day.  Yeah.  It's been just an assortment.  A smorgasbord of guests.  A lot of different genres.  Yes.  Jim Norton theme.  I think.  I think.  Jim Norton, all the things he loves.  Well, I think right now, for what's happening with what we're doing with that song,  it's like nothing else that's going on like that.  I don't know where in the music industry right now.  What song? 
[03:22:30]  At all.  Knocked down the walls.  In the whole music industry, there's nothing going on like that.  Mr. Chubby, how many times have you performed The Twist?  It's all my life.  But how many times do you think you've performed The Twist?  As many times as Walt Disney does Mickey Mouse.  That's as many times.  Let's be honest.  You're sick of The Twist at this point.  You've got to be sick of The Twist.  Do you have any idea what it means?  How could you ever get sick of having sex?  How do you put it?  No, come, come, come, come. 
[03:23:00]  I'm going to.  How many times will you be ever sick of having sex?  Now, let me tell you what The Twist is.  It's just another word for, come on, baby.  Let's do The Twist.  Oh, let's fuck.  Take me by my little hand.  Take me by my little hand and go like this.  Go like this.  My mom is sleeping and daddy's sleeping and mom ain't around.  We're going to twist and twist and twist until we tear the house down. 
[03:23:30]  You get tired of that?  I don't think so.  So you got away with one.  I never knew that that was about.  That's exactly what it's about.  Why do you think?  It's the only song to be number one twice.  It's all.  You know something?  That is the nastiest, most suggestive, sexy song that was ever recorded.  You got to twist it because if you can't get hard, if you twist it up, you can still shove  it in there.  At the end of the song, it says, yeah, that's all right. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Twist so nice.  Twist.  Boop, boop.  Why don't you do it?  Why don't you do it?  That's Rayner version, man.  You've made a lot of money.  Ask Rudy Reymour.  He does.  Yeah, really?  Rudy Reymour does all the nasty twist things.  Dolemai, yes.  I've met Dolemai.  He does the nasty.  How about this, guys?  It's disc jockeys.  Have you ever heard of an artist having five albums on the top 12 all at the same time  on the charts?  Oh, my God.  Well, Foundry did it back in the day. 
[03:24:30]  Foundry certainly did.  No, sorry.  Never had four, not five.  Never had four.  All right.  You have five albums in the top 12.  Five albums in the top 12 all on the charts at the same time.  Are you doing the Ali story, too?  Wrong about that.  Hey, what's up next, by the way?  How about the first platinum?  How's that?  How's that?  It looks like Ali's old trainer.  First platinum.  I love Chubby.  Let me tell you about Ali.  Want to hear about Ali?  Yeah.  Tell us about some celebrity girls.  I taught Ali how to run his big, fat mouth.  Whoa.  Did you really? 
[03:25:00]  Listen.  When he was Cassius?  No, true story.  Yeah, when he was Cassius.  I was in Louisville doing a concert, and there he was.  He and his brother, Rudy, came in to see me, and I love, I love Ali.  We're good friends.  Ali has a brother named Rudy?  Named Rudy, yes.  Who the fuck knew that?  And they came in to, so Ali, you know, Cassius says, you know, I says, he said, you know,  I like you.  You know, your music's real nice, man, everything.  He says, you know, I want to be champ.  I says, what are you doing here?  I says, you should be a movie star, not a fighter.  You look too pretty to be getting your face banged up.  He said, no, but I want to be champ. 
[03:25:30]  I said, so what do you want me to do for you?  He said, maybe give me some pointers.  Can you may help me?  Because I'm young, and you know, and I said to him, I says, Cassius, how good are you?  He says, this is what he says, I'm the best that ever lived.  And I says, really?  He said, I said, I know you're good.  He said, I'm the best that ever lived.  I said, I'll tell you what you do.  I said, if you're the best, I says, when you go out in the ring, and you look at, and  you say, he's going to go down in that round.  Can you do that? 
[03:26:00]  He said, he thought about that for a while.  He said, you know, I said, can you do that?  He said, I can do that.  I said, well, then you'll be the best.  I said, but it's not good enough.  You're good looking.  No one's going to pay any attention to you because you're pretty.  You got to run your mouth.  You got to do things to make something happen.  You got to make a big deal out of it.  So you made him into who he became.  Look, he already had what he had.  I just showed him how to move it.  And you know something?  When he became a big star, he wouldn't tell nobody about it.  And you know what?  He was nothing.  He was so happy.  If he hadn't met Chubby Checkers. 
[03:26:30]  Hold on.  He was so happy by what you taught him that he gave you his old hair.  You look like him, Cassius Clay.  You look like him.  You got the Cassius Clay hair.  You taught Cassius how to talk.  Voss taught Sonny Liston how to be stupid.  I really felt sorry for Sonny because Cassius came out and he picked up the chub because in the fifth round, he's coming out in the sixth.  He says, this is it.  And that invisible punch came and the rest of the story.  So I wrote him a letter about five years ago on his birthday. 
[03:27:00]  I says, why didn't you ever tell anybody about that story about what I said?  You don't want to share your fame with me.  Huh.  But we're very good friends and very good friends with his family.  And we're very good friends.  We always have been.  He shows up on a lot of my shows.  Did anybody open for you that became a real, real big star?  Is it hard for you to talk to a man whose headset is on like that?  It hurts my other ear.  It hurts his ear.  You got to give him the right hand.  An NFL coach.  Did Bee Gees open for you?  Did you ever work with like the Temptations or anybody like that or Diana Ross or any Motown people? 
[03:27:30]  I never worked with Diana and only with the four tops.  You worked with the four?  Yeah.  I just did a show with Sticks and a show with.  I just did a concert with Sticks and.  Kansas.  And.  Grassroots.  Boston.  Humble Pines.  I just did a show with them up in.  Journey.  Northern Michigan.  Big concert.  It was really cool.  Sticks and who else? 
[03:28:00]  Journey.  And Grassroots.  Grassroots.  Yeah.  I don't know them.  I know.  I know Sticks.  You know Sticks.  Yeah.  I like them.  They kind of jumped the shark after they did the Mr. Roboto stage show.  Let's be honest.  Chubby.  Nobody liked it.  Nobody liked them acting it out.  It was a little weird.  Well you know people make mistakes.  Could you do it?  I know but I'm just saying.  Oh by the way I want everyone out there to pray for my wife because she's not doing well.  She was in the hospital.  She just got out.  What happened?  Pray for Rina.  Pray for my girl Rina because she's not doing too well.  Is she going to be alright? 
[03:28:30]  What happened?  I think she'll be okay.  She's got a little something in her neck and had to go to the doctor and so you know pray  for my girl.  I've been hanging out since 1964.  Wow.  Are you worried?  It's a long time.  Of course I'm worried.  You know if you live with somebody a long time like that.  You know.  They kind of you know.  So anyway I just wanted to bring it up so when you think of the chub think of my girl  and say a little prayer for her.  Okay.  You ever get sick of the recognition or people I mean obviously people flock you because  you're chubby checker.  Does it ever get to be irritating where you just want to be kind of left alone? 
[03:29:00]  Well you know it doesn't really bother me because you know without I hate it when they  do it.  I hate it when they don't.  That's the best way to do that because you know without the people I'm nothing.  And you know if they're not listening to your show you're nothing.  So they're very no they're very no no they're very valuable people are very valuable and  I take a great pride in having I came out of the studio this morning and there were 20  people with my abs and everything and I said I'm signing some of them and let's sign some

I always  Oh  What, what?  Is that a bad one?  Well, almost  Why?  Is that a bad one?  Why?  That's the stuff people want to hear about  Well, the thing is, you know, sometimes we do a show 
[03:40:30]  And we have to make it  Then the drivers, you know, have to have sleep  And I've got half of my clothes on  Because, you know, I've left the fans  And I just get behind the wheel and do about three or four hours  So the driver can get some sleep  Because it's not odd to see me behind the tour bus driving it  Because I'll do it, why should they have all the fun?  But you have to do it naked for everybody?  Well, sometimes a little air comes in the water  Sometimes it makes you feel good  Sometimes it takes some clothes off  Now I know why they call you Chubby  You've got a nice piece, right?

[03:44:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:44:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:45:00]  Knocked down the walls.  Is this off the new CD, All the Best?  Yes.  It's some of the old stuff and some new stuff, right?  There's the 20th century there on one side.  And on the blue side is the 21st century.  And it's just, I don't know.  That's very clever.  Are they the first garage band you ever played with? 
[03:45:30]  Ashley, the guy's from Wishbone Ash.  Really?  Yeah.  The guy's from Wishbone Ash is doing the guitar there.  And it's tasteful.  Well, it's a whole new audience because now we're getting play on stations that we never got played on before.  And so we have another audience.  And it's kind of interesting.  It's got a little crossover flavor to it.  And actually, after you hear it and someone says, it's me, everybody gets quiet. 
[03:46:00]  Because, well, what are you going to do with that thing?  You know, it's chugging, chugging.  But it's interesting.  Thank you guys for letting the people hear it out there.  I appreciate it.  Certainly.  Thank you for coming in.  It's great to have you in.  A lot of fun.  Happy birthday, Bubba.  Thank you.  I wouldn't have known it was you.  But our crack staff, because of the surprise, played the twist 20 minutes before you walked in.  I see.  Because that's always the way to keep the surprise going.  Well, that's okay.  I think that was quite cool, seeing a legendary song like the twist performed by the legendary Chubby Checker. 
[03:46:30]  But Chad Chubby playing it with Sabra Cadabra is just like some kind of acid hallucination.  Let me tell you, in two weeks, you're going to be a Chubby Checker cover band.  Musician talk.  Musician talk.  Yeah, absolutely.  Can I tell you, Chubby didn't play fucking games either.  Take it down, you.  Do this.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Just the court, stupid.  Yeah.  You see how he bossed them around? 
[03:47:00]  That's why we don't want Barack.  But what was great about them is that the great thing about them is they follow instructions.  And that's the most important thing.  That's it.  Now we should flip it and make Chubby sing a Black Sabbath song.  The band gets shirts.  Is he your tour manager?  Is he your tour manager?  He produces all those records.  Gary's a record producer.  And he's very good at what he does.  And if it wasn't for Gary, I really wouldn't have nothing going on.  He's a sandwich.  Yeah.  He's good.  Hey, Mishmukka.  He's known as the Boshmukka. 
[03:47:30]  Mishmukka.  What does that mean, sir?  What are you saying?  Family.  Family.  Oh, really?  He's family.  He's part of the family, the Jews.  Who do I see?  What?  It's uncomfortable when you sing to me like that.  The Nefzame.  There's been some kind of Jew spell on you.  Hey, check this out.  If it wasn't for the Jews, I wouldn't be here.  A little cow man says, Chubbis? 
[03:48:00]  Come over here.  You know what they call me in Italy?  In Israel?  Sell out.  No.  One hit wonder.  Uh-oh.  I could come up with something.  In Israel, they call me Svetsuke.  In Israel, they call me Svetsuke.  Yes.  You played all over the world, right?  All over.  All over the place, yeah.  You've always gotten a good response.  Very good.  And also, guys, go to www.thelasttwist.com and see all my food products.  I've got some candy bars and everything.  Wait, what do you want me to say? 
[03:48:30]  Oh, what is the deal?  It's time to go.  It's time to go.  Why?  Why?  Hey!  Duty calls.  Duty calls.  I love you.  Hey, I love you.  Love you.  Love you.  Thank you so much.  And don't get tired at Twist because it's the same as having sex.  That's right.  Chubby, thank you so much.  Thank you, guys.  Now, twist your way out of here.  That was pretty cool.  Chubby.  I got to push me.  You know what?  The guy sounds exactly like the record.  Of course he does.  He was stabber-cadabber playing. 
[03:49:00]  He performed the song 800,000 times.  Of course he does.  Well, of course.  Oh, no.  Are you going to punch?  Oh, no.  Chubby's going to punch me.  No, no.  He wants a picture.  Hold my hand.  Give me that, uh, thing.  Come on, Sidney.  Thank you, Chubby.  Come on, baby.  Thank you.  Let's do the twist.  All right.  Chubby, is that your real hair?  Chubster, is that your real hair?  He said no.  No? 
[03:49:30]  Dang.  Looks good, though.  Gotta give him an ass.  What?  I was just asking.  There's two Chubsters.  I'm in costume today.  You're in what?  I'm in costume.  Costume today.  All right.  He looks good, man.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  That was fun.  Chubby, thank you so much.  Thanks for coming.  There goes the legendary Chubby Checker.  Thank you to CW11 for bringing it.  Thank you.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Right?  No.  Oh, damn.  Damn.  Uh-uh.  No, you didn't. 
[03:50:00]  Twisting again.  There he goes.  Chubby Checker getting a round of applause from the fans.  The rousing round of applause.  People really digging the Chubster.  Yeah, there you are, man.  Chubby.  Chubby.  Chubby.  Chubby.  Listen to the chants.  Louis C.K.  What did Louis C.K. do?  Louis C.K. had me crying.  What did he do?  What did he do?  Chubby was talking about his history.  So Louis goes, all right, man.  Happy birthday, Jim, right?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:50:30]  Chubby's an interesting guy.  He certainly is.  Oh, but when he schooled the band, that was awesome.  It was fun, yeah.  That was pretty cool.  Yeah.  Oh, you guys picked that right up, you know.  You guys picked it up, man.  You guys are real deal, man.  You're like, no, no, I want it to stop right there.  Boom.  Come on, baby.  Hey, Jimmy.  Stop it right there.  I got to ask Jimmy something.  You think Chubby Checker likes the twist?  I'm just wondering.  I don't really know.  I don't know.  I'm a little confused by this one.  I think Chubby loves it.  His hair is like the sponge inside of a stamp thing where you make, you know. 
[03:51:00]  You know, the stamp when you make a stamp.  Oh, my God.  He's not still here, is he?  Oh, God.  Oh, I wanted to twist his head.  I wanted to practice my putting on his hair.  It's like a Chia Chubby.  Exactly.  I wanted to twist him in the head with a Nerf bat.  It just was so funny how he just took over. 
[03:51:30]  Like, where there's Jimmy's birthday and now we're all listening to a slow story.  One song in a trillion that came out in 59.  Like, Jimmy gives a fuck on his 40th birthday.  About the genesis of the fucking twist.  By the end of the story, the Chia Afro grew another half.  Me, Chia, fucking Afro helmet. 
[03:52:00]  You need a chin strap with that.  Fucking Chia checkers.  He was like, you know what?  I got hostile with him because he's like, my dad.  My dad does that.  Oh, really?  Everybody's having a good time.  And instead of staying on everybody else's frequency and talking, he'll just go, you know.  And we all go, oh, fuck.  You fucking microphone protector head.  Or windscreen.  It is.  Microphone.  That's where he got it.  He was doing a gig and they had one of those.  Well, let's bring Chubby in. 
[03:52:30]  Chubby and Jenna had one of the greatest helmets.  No, let's not.  Let's bring Chubby in and see how brave we really are.  No, let's not.  His helmet was made of bobe.  I think Chubby likes Chubby.  Chubby is fun.  He's 64 years old, by the way, doing that shit.  64 years old.  64, he looks awesome.  He's gone?  He's gone.  All right, now let's really get the jokes going.  All right, here's the thing.  Now, the way he was talking about the gig he's going to play is like, we're playing here  and doing the morning show and then I'm going to Newark Airport. 
[03:53:00]  Yes.  Oh, you're playing in the airport?  Gate C4.  To get a flight to Kansas City where I'm going to do a gig.  Can I ask you a question?  You go and see Chubby Checker.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  How many songs do you sit through where you start getting frustrated that he's not playing  the twist?  Everyone's on.  Do a twist.  You'll give him one, maybe two songs and you're like, well, you get to the fucking twist.  No, definitely.  He probably, the twist probably goes on for like 12 minutes when he does it.  Everybody does a solo.  I like to see him doing the twist and his body's moving, but his hair is staying in 
[03:53:30]  one spot underneath him.  But he didn't even write the twist.  I thought he wrote it.  No, that's his thing.  It was Ray Ballard.  That's from James Brown.  Well, fucking Voss, you really got to the meat of the issue.  Did you ever meet the Temptations?  Well, because I want to talk about the other man's hair.  You dislike him because he held your arm the whole time.  I like what Chubby said.  A fucking legend in the studio and we beat the shit out of him.  And why did we do this to Sabra Kadam?  That was great.  What did they do wrong? 
[03:54:00]  Wasn't that nice of them?  Because now they have two things on their resume.  Okay?  That was probably a nice...  You know that's going right on the website, though.  Performing with Chubby Checker.  What are we doing?  We were taught by Chubby Checker.  Chubby taught them how to play the four-bar blues as if they didn't know how to do that.  By the way, every surprise today has failed misery.  No, no, no. 
[03:54:30]  Every surprise got blown.  Steve blew the CW11 yesterday.  Yes, we have them coming.  Yes.  And that ruined it.  And then Roland didn't mean to before, but at K-Rock, he goes, hey, Michael K.  Liam's overslept.  Oh, so you knew he was calling.  But I didn't think he was calling in, to be honest with you.  And then the twist music.  It's amazing.  We're the worst.  Yeah, we go.  We got a big surprise.  And people think the government knocked down the Twin Towers.  People can't keep a Chubby Checker secret. 
[03:55:00]  That was the big get today, too.  Chubby Checker secret.  Yes.  But it just was funny, because that's Jimmy's...  I was like...  All Jimmy ever wanted on his birthday was to hear the history of fucking the twist.  I was happy that they came in, but when they said, we got a big guest, and then I heard  the twist.  Yeah.  And Opie said, well, that's our big guest.  And I'm like, I hope fucking Ozzy did a cover on this.  Hey, we got a girl that wants to come in and give you a little present there. 
[03:55:30]  Oh, who's the girl and what's the gift?  What job and how much?  I don't know, Jimmy.  I don't know.  I love a good...  Holy shit.  Hello, it's just me.  Sorry.  I don't think I could follow Chubby Checker.  Who's that?  Michelle LaFong?  No, this is Janine, who used to...  Hello, dear.  Hi.  Who's lost how many pounds now?  About 177.  Wow.  Oh, wait.  I used Chubby Checkers.  You were huge.  And you don't even...  Thank you. 
[03:56:00]  You don't even have the lesions on you.  I do.  Oh.  Frank the Frowner...  What is that?  That's made out of what?  These are figurines that I made for you, Jimmy.  There's five of them all together.  Who's the girls?  Let me see, Jimmy.  Frank the Frowner looks like an ass.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I'm not that good.  Jimmy, can I see you?  No.  Oh, boy.  I have stairs.  That's never good.  You're going to stick pins in them, Jimmy.  And, hey, Steve.  Where's Steve?  I have a question for Steve.  Steve.  Steve?  I'm sorry.  Steve, uh...  What happened to the other people? 
[03:56:30]  What?  God.  I don't know what I mean.  Whatever happened to, like, uh...  This is the worst birthday I've ever...  Oh, dude.  It's so sad.  This is so sad.  There's actually one thing left.  There's actually one thing left.  Somebody just get a whore here to suck the four kids' car.  It's his birthday.  It's sad.  Two hours sleep for this...  Yeah, I got no sleep.  What do you want next, Jimmy?  You want another Sabra Cadaver song?  And then we set up your last surprise?  What, uh, yeah, of course.  There's another one.  Wait.  Oh, Ted, the life of that.  Oh, you made no Ted figurines.  What are they made out of?  Clay. 
[03:57:00]  They made them.  They're made of clay.  What other surprises could there be?  That's creepy.  Well, Louie...  It's really disturbing.  We got you fish and...  We got you fish and chips from the airport in Kansas.  We know how much you love fish and chips.  Sorry.  The final surprise is going to be Little Richard.  He's going to come in and suck us all off.  It's really cool to be on a radio show  that apparently has never met me before.  Thank God.  He called you. 
[03:57:30]  All right, let's get some Sabra Cadabra on the air.  Wait, here's the big plug for those guys.  Tomorrow at the Surf Club, 1900 Ocean Avenue.  That's nice.  Ortley Beach, New Jersey.  SabraCadabra.com with a bunch of Bs, right?  You guys do the double Bs.  Oh, boy.  We can't hear them.  We can't plug their website.  We can't hear them.  Oh, boy.  We still don't have a...  7-3-2-7-9-3-6-6-2-5 for tickets to see Sabra Cadabra.  How about this one?  That's better.  All right.  Oh, great.  Okay.  All right.  Once again, it's Sabra Cadabra.  And then Jimmy's final surprise. 
[03:58:00]  And then we'll...  170 pounds.  Is that unbelievable?  In a year.  Yeah, Janine.  She's like a regular at FH.  She's a fucking...  I can't even use fucking five pounds.  You're so fucking doable now.  It's not even funny.  And you don't even have a lot of skin extra.  I do.  I really do.  A lot of skin extra?  Why do you talk like E.T.?  Or fucking Yoda?  How is that Yoda?  You don't have a lot of skin extra.  Hey, look it.  It's because your birthday party's bombing.  Don't take it out on me.  All right?  Well, you're a big part of that fucking... 
[03:58:30]  You're the fucking detonator on the fucking top.  What do you think?  You're making this a shindig?  Fuck off.  Hey, Chubby!  Did you ever fly in a prop plane?  Were you on the plane with Buddy Holly?  You're the fucking irrelevant questions.  Chubby, do you fly business or first?  Well, you know.  Do you have to check your hair?  Chubby, that hairy candy dish on your head.  Can I eat a lute? 
[03:59:00]  It's cough dropping out of the fucking...  The fucking worst questions I've ever heard.  Oh, my God.  What does the twist really mean, Chubby?  I thought Chubby took the black mold from your old apartment  and put it on his head.  That's cool.  Sabra Kadabra, everyone.  Chubby checkers.  By the way, thank you for bringing Chubby in.  I appreciate it.  Because originally I said I wanted Elizabeth.  They're like, oh, well, we can't get that old queen. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  All right.  You get it?  No one was buying the whole wife thing in the hospital.  Oh, yeah.  It sounds like Chubby's wife has been in the hospital for 40-some-odd years.  Jesus.  Oh, she's in the hospital.  That's where she is.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  To this imaginary wife of his.  Fucking Voss.  I should start calling you now.  Charlie Rose.  Those are really good questions.  Chubby, do you like singing into the microphone or away from it? 
[04:00:00]  Chubby, do you like when people clap?  To you.  No.  To you.  Shit questions.  You fucking asshole.  Did you ever perform with Benny Goodman?  Yes.  Going back.  If you were at Marvin Gaye's house, would you have jumped in front of the bullet?  Chubby, to you.  You're a fucking cunt.  You're fucking terrible.  Did you ever go to Motown?  Shut up.  How did I receive you in Israel? 
[04:00:30]  Fucking zilch.  Mohammed.  Mohammed.  Oh, my God.  The fucking worst questions ever.  That means family.  Would you be starstruck if you met Ali now?  And him taking credit for Ali.  I bet you Ali learned a fight because he was like, get away from me, faggot.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The first boss said he looked like Ali from the side.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he goes, is that Ali's hair? 
[04:01:00]  Did you catch his?  Oh, yeah.  Did you hear the codependent me?  Ah, you kind of look like Ali.  I was just covering up.  Trying to cover up because you were embarrassed.  I was embarrassed, but I also, I mean, Voss was getting to the fucking, really, the tough  questions, and I was like, I want to get further into Chubby's psyche.  Do you put an umbrella up when it rains, Chubby?  Fucking stopping everybody from talking with your hand up.  Oh, I got one.  I got one.  Does guitar help a song? 
[04:01:30]  Chubby, if you would.  The fucking temptations.  You're the fucking old lady.  How old am I, fucking 68 today?  Why don't you bring in Regis, too, you fucking cunt.  You got him?  You just blew the last surprise.  Oh, damn.  It was going to be Art Linklater.  Art Linklater and Regis were going to come in. 
[04:02:00]  By the way, we strong-armed his handler there.  That cunt.  It's like, you got $10,000 for the twist.  I go, well, you've got five for us to play the new record, motherfucker?  We got that done.  Let's just bring Maury Amsterdam in now.  Maury.  Maury.  Maury.  Maury.  Maury.  Maury.  Maury.  So if you were going to work with a Canadian, Soupy Sales, do you like him or not?  Go ahead.  You're among friends, Chubby.  Chubby.  Oh, that's funny. 
[04:02:30]  Ruth Gordon's clit is going to come rolling in.  You guys got Bret Michaels?  Who?  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  What are you whispering, Steve?  Who's the first Bret Summers?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Almost.  She's dead.  Oops.  Can I take a break first?  That's a girl?  That's a girl.  That's Bret Michaels.  No.  Oh, no.  Let's take a break.  Do the rest of the show.  Come back and leave.  Yes.  Sabra Cadabra's going to play. 
[04:03:00]  Let's go to commercial so nobody can hear them.  Arrange for Chubby Checker.  Let's get Sabra.  And I wrote out Rich's questions.  Let's get Sabra Cadabra.  Another song from Sabra Cadabra.  Yes.  It's Jimmy's birthday, everyone.  Come on.  Jimmy's birthday.  Sabra Cadabra, take it away.  Thank you.

[04:18:00]  I thought, is that what you wanted?  Well, it's just a clusterfuck.  I'm sorry.  Sorry, I'm a cadabra.  We just, we're running out of time.  We're running out of time on the computer.  The computer will cut us off.  It's the boobies.  Well, what, booby cake or what?  Booby cake, boobies.  Is the cake good?  Booby cake, boobies.  It's a little.  What's that?  A very nice lap dance, by the way.  What's your name?  Amy.  Amy?  Yeah. 
[04:18:30]  Amy doing the lap dance with Jimmy.  I noticed you kept the pants on.  Yeah.  Is someone on their period?  They're kind of hard to get off over the Texas boots.  You could have pulled them down a little.  Is it that time of month for somebody?  Jesus Christ.  Just put some more icing on the cake, that's all.  As they say in London, the painters have arrived.  Are we talking low tide today?  Low tide.  Amy Campbell at Penthouse.  It's variations, cat o'nines, fetish gala.  I don't know what this plug means.  I'm really sorry.  What are we plugging today there, Amy? 
[04:19:00]  It's a fetish party.  We have a fetish party on Sunday nights.  Very cool.  What does that mean?  Can you like a...  It means you can come and give me a nice foot massage if you'd like.  That's your party?  You just have people come over to the house and do shit to you?  Yes.  No, it's the cutting room.  It's the cutting room.  And it's just a fetish party.  That's it.  You know.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How much does it cost to get in?  I think $20.  That's it for a fetish party?  I have a free fetish party.  To get in?  Oh, the club.  Oh, oh.  The fetish party is $20.  Fetish.  And thank you to Travis and Lisa. 
[04:19:30]  They gave me a very nice card and a little iTunes gift card.  Thanks, guys.  That dumb dog is here, too.  I know.  That dumb, stupid dog.  Thank you very much.  Amy, thank you so much.  She's very attractive.  Very lovely gal.  Excellent.  Go on.  All right.  And don't think I'm not going to do a quick birthday party summary.  Jimmy's getting ready to do a birthday party summary.  What do you guys think of Amy?  She can hear us all. 
[04:20:00]  I thought she was lovely.  Yeah.  Lovely.  It was odd.  She had her pants on her.  Sexy.  Oh, that was odd.  Little cowgirl.  Catherine Bach type shit.  Her nipples were crying.  What's that?  I thought they were zippers.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I thought there was candy coming out of them.  No.  She had nice breasts.  What do you think of the birthday celebration?  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, rolling everyone.  Damn, dog.  She's still there. 
[04:20:30]  Celebration?  Oh, my God.  She's still there, yo.  It's all there.  I mean, tough heaven.  Fuck she had.  Oh, shit.  That takes a lot of nerve to take your clothes off.  What the fuck was that?  No, I'm just kidding.  Now, what takes a lot of nerve is to go, hey, Chubby, did you ever work with anybody  in Motown?  That takes a lot of nerve.  Yeah.  Voss.  I had some very good questions from Mr. Checker.  It was perhaps the most uninsightful interview I've ever heard.  You had a method acting joke that went by everybody that was very, very funny, actually. 
[04:21:00]  Oh, thank you.  You don't even know what the line was, do you?  What was the line?  With Omar said he was stealing something.  And I go, you're a method actor.  Yeah.  By the way.  All right.  This CBS cake.  She's gone.  Could be the worst cake anybody's ever eaten.  Really?  Bad?  That's right.  Where's the dancer?  She left.  She left.  She left.  Why did she leave?  Was she crying?  With the cowboy hat?  No, she wasn't crying.  Why would she cry?  She said her titties were crying.  Yes.  That was awesome.  I'm bad, man. 
[04:21:30]  Oh, man.  Rich, you were making those faces, though.  Oh, yeah.  That fucking birthday cake.  I want to take it back to CBS and mush it on the rug.  The ice cream cake was fantastic.  That was from what?  Who was that from?  That's what?  That's the CBS cake?  Yeah.  It had nice strawberries on top.  As usual.  Self-encovered strawberries.  CBS does not come with the best products.  All right.  This up.  Now we'll try the penthouse cake.  Yeah, the penthouse cake.  Give that a try.  Give it a little, just a little sliver, a little something to treat myself.  You know, nothing too much.  Got to watch the calories. 
[04:22:00]  We're winding down this birthday extravaganza.  It's all about portions, sir.  Eat this part.  We'll put a glory hole in front of it.  That was hurtful, Rich.  Yeah, there's no reason to blow up my camera.  It'll make yours shine brighter.  Not on his birthday.  What are you doing?  Hey, who wants a chubby checker CD?  I took it.  I haven't found it.  Break down the wall.  I saw the autograph at the last second.  Didn't Reagan do that bit already?  What?  Break down the wall.  Oh, boy. 
[04:22:30]  Wow.  Thank you.  They don't miss anything out there.  Shut up, you fucking joblish.  All right, Jimmy.  We're running out of show.  They're going to shut us off in less than five minutes here, so now we need the big...  They should have three hours ago.  Well, yeah.  This was fun, baby.  Shut up.  Of course it was fun.  Kidding.  Trying to interject some humor.  Good luck.  By the way, Oak, it was so uncomfortable when you asked if he took Ollie's hair. 
[04:23:00]  I know.  But I really had to say the balls, like...  I can't do it.  What is that?  You can't do what?  I could never ask that question.  I wish I could.  It was funny.  I can't do it.  No.  I'm a coward.  Why?  And then, hey, chubby, is that your real hair?  And then he goes, no.  And then you asked him again.  Asked him again.  Yeah, because I didn't hear him say no.  I think he wanted to keep it on the QT.  That he looks like a Q-tip. 
[04:23:30]  Oh, damn it.  I'll have a piece of that cake, too.  Have some cake, Rich.  If they can't afford bread, eat them.  I fucked up.  Jimmy, where do we start?  We've got to do the big wrap-up.  You wanted to kind of give some of your observations from today.  Summary.  You want to start with that?  What do you say about this bash to end all bashes?  Is it simply because nobody will ever attend a bash again?  Nothing.  See?  I think this ends birthday shows.  This should end birthday celebrations. 
[04:24:00]  Yeah.  Period.  Thank God.  I will say, Sabra Kedabra, you guys kick ass as always.  Yeah!  Thank you.  Sabra Kedabra.  Sorry the microphone didn't work.  Why would they, though?  No, of course they wouldn't.  Why would they?  And thank you to the studio audience for coming in and just being you and giving me your gifts.  And thank you for Danny.  Thank you.  Just carrying cake.  Well, I might have something else for you, Jim.  Oh!  There's a listener in the front row, a female listener, who would be willing to get into  bra panties for a piece of cake. 
[04:24:30]  Wow, all right.  That's exactly what our listeners are about.  Sure.  So it's not the birthday.  It's like, can I have some cake?  I'll show you my cunt.  Jeez.  All right, who's the lady who wants to get into her bra panties?  Ouch.  Let's do this.  Get in here.  Get some cake.  Let's do this.  Hell yeah.  All right.  Boy, it's so real.  That's how we're going to have dessert at home.  Bra panties.  We're going to get bra panties.  And thank you to Jill Nicolini, of course.  The lovely Jill Anthony.  Yes, from CW11.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Happy birthday. 
[04:25:00]  Thank you, guys.  Thanks for Jill bringing me here.  How about we thank you for bringing Godfrey.  Thank you for bringing...  Chubby.  ...a guy.  I listened to one of his songs in the mid-70s.  And thank you for playing the cue early and...  No problem.  ...fucking disaster.  This was...  But this was perfect.  How about we...  Sabra Kedabra playing with Chubby Checker.  This was fucking great.  Yeah.  Thank you guys for everything, of course.  And don't be...  Fantastic Christmas gift.  Thank you.  My birthday gift.  Christmas gift.  I fucked up.  I confused myself with Christ. 
[04:25:30]  God, I'm like bombing.  Chubby Checker gave you guys a talking to.  Oh, boy.  I want to thank you for letting me sit down with the young lions.  Oh, Jesus.  Easy, sweetie.  Sweetie.  Fucking guy knows one song and he's telling Sabra Kedabra what to do.  Yeah.  What the fuck, man?  Son of a bitch.  How about we give you two pieces of cake not to take anything off?  Which one are you?  Sure.  Why?  Rich.  Rich.  Basically, the problem, Rich. 
[04:26:00]  Because she's a nice girl and she doesn't have to take her clothes off for a piece of cake.  Ma'am, what Rich was trying to say is he doesn't think you have the body.  Reminds me of a girl that should be naked.  You're losing the show.  And I can't believe you would say that, Rich.  Anything's better than that stripper.  Yes, get down to your bra and panties and you'll get some cake.  Quickly.  Yeah, we're running out of show.  It's a skirt.  Wait, make her sit on the bad cake to get a piece of the good cake.  What?  All right.  Oh, she's got XM panties on.  Yep.  Those XM panties. 
[04:26:30]  Panties.  You want the shirt, too?  Yeah.  If we have some.  Oh, you got a little nipple poke out.  Yeah.  Not bad.  Now she wants cake.  Yeah.  All right.  Which one?  Have some cake.  You want the Jimmy Norton cake?  I don't care.  Whichever one's better.  You want the Jimmy Norton cake?  This one's better.  It's fine.  Get in there and get a piece of cake.  Get a good one.  Order me a piece of cake.  Why don't you have a burger, fries, and a whole meal?  That is the tiniest bra I've ever seen in my life.  That is a tiny bra. 
[04:27:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I'm just saying.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right, girl.  Get that cake, girl.  Go on, cut that cake, girl.  Ha, ha.  Don't drop that cake, girl.  Miss, you're ruining my party.  Gotcha.  That's right, girl.  Got a naked bottle of cake.  Party has been ruined.  Naked cake, baby.  Since six o'clock.  Cut the cake.  It's a...  Cut the cake.  By the way, less cake, more vegetables.  Cut the cake. 
[04:27:30]  Cut the cake.  That's right, girl.  Get naked for that cake, baby.  I'm sorry.  Yep.  Congrats.  Yeah.  Eat that cake, baby.  This is my party.  And this is a tribute you were paid.  Make it as cake, baby.  I can glomerate for a lot of cake.  Eat that cake, baby.  Wow.  Eat that motherfucking cake, girl.  Eat that motherfucking cake, girl.  RFK.  RFK.  Get a better party in the kitchen. 
[04:28:00]  This is how I'm going to end all the way.  Oh.  Take it, baby.  And...  It's M202. </pre>
