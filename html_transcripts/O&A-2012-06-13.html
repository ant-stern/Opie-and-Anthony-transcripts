<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of the Oklahoma City Thunder's NBA Finals victory, incorporating personal anecdotes about interactions with NBA players like Chris Bosh, LeBron James, and Dwayne Wade. This segued into a broader comparison of how athletes, actors, and musicians interact with the public.  The conversation then shifted to a detailed analysis of the documentary "Still Alive," about Paul Williams, covering his career, songwriting, and personal struggles.  This was followed by a heated debate about New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's policies on soda sizes and potential future regulations, touching on individual responsibility versus government control.  The segment included humorous and sexually explicit banter about Jane Fonda, and a discussion of a Massachusetts law fining public profanity. A caller pitched a celebrity golf tournament before the segment ended.

The next segment started with a discussion about the bizarre combination of bacon and ice cream, sparking a broader conversation on food preferences, including strong opinions on cold, reheated food and a fondness for mayonnaise-laden sandwiches.  A caller, B-Rock, shared his aversion to sweets, while another, Iraq, detailed his love for rye bread and liverwurst sandwiches, prompting a humorous exchange about bread preferences and a graphic description of a reaction to liverwurst.  The discussion touched upon childhood food memories and economic disparities influencing food choices. A listener email about dipping Wendy's fries in chocolate Frosties led to a discussion of unusual food combinations, before abruptly transitioning to the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse trial. The hosts reacted with outrage to testimony from Mike McQuarrie and other victims, using highly offensive language to describe the accounts and the alleged inaction of Penn State officials.  The segment also included a seemingly unrelated clip of a seemingly intoxicated person post-wisdom tooth removal, and continued with further discussion and varied caller opinions on the Sandusky case.

The following segment centered heavily on the Sandusky scandal, with the hosts and callers vehemently condemning Sandusky and Penn State officials.  The conversation was filled with highly offensive language and graphic descriptions of sexual acts and violence, both related to the case and in unrelated tangents. Speculation about Sandusky's potential fate in prison was discussed, alongside a caller arguing the scandal was primarily about protecting Penn State’s reputation and finances.  The conversation veered off into a humorous anecdote about a misplaced ID, a news segment about a man refusing orders from women, and a bizarre clip about a supposed witness to the Lincoln assassination. The segment included a humorous bit about calculating the number of farts needed to fill a hot air balloon, a preview of a comedic segment about “Meet the MacGregors,” and a brief promotion of Jimmy Fallon's new CD.

The next segment featured a recurring comedic bit with "Valley Virus," a struggling comedian attempting (and failing) to tell a joke about the Sandusky trial.  This was eventually saved for a later appearance with Jimmy Fallon, who arrived in the studio.  The conversation shifted to Fallon's career, including anecdotes about working with James Brown and Paul McCartney, and his experiences with President Obama during a "Slow Jam the News" segment.  Fallon discussed his album, "Blow Your Pants Off," and other projects.  The segment concluded with Opie recounting a near-brawl in Times Square after repeated taxi frustrations, culminating in a confrontation with a Russian pedal cab driver that was diffused by a hotel doorman and NYPD officers.


A segment primarily focused on Sam Roberts' near-fight with what he described as intimidating "Russians," and the unexpected success of Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe," which Roberts credited to the show’s promotion.  The discussion included a comparison of Jimmy Fallon's success to other late-night hosts and speculation on the future of *The Tonight Show*.  Roberts repeatedly emphasized the show’s role in launching "Call Me Maybe," using highly offensive language to express his frustration at others taking credit.  He repeatedly demanded credit and compensation from Carly Rae Jepsen.  DJ Who Kid was a guest in the studio.  The conversation also included crude and sexually explicit comments about other artists and a graphic account by Eric of an incident where he defecated at Sam Roberts' wedding. The segment concluded with several hypothetical scenarios involving bodily fluids and sexual acts.

The final segment heavily featured discussions about bodily functions and feces.  The discussion started with Opie having baby feces on his lip, detailing its taste as "salted butter," and moved onto E-Rock's history of defecating on himself, particularly at a wedding.  The hosts and callers discussed the causes of E-Rock's digestive issues, ranging from diet and exercise to medical intervention.  The conversation included a digression on manually assisting a constipated dog and comparing E-Rock's issues to an abortion.  A story about Snoop Dogg defecating while high, with the surprising detail of it smelling like roses, was also recounted.  The segment concluded with a guest, Troy, promoting his upcoming party, mentioning his performance would involve masturbation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  I was actually in bed by 1230.  And you're proud of yourself?  And you're proud of yourself?  Yeah, because sometimes I'm usually like in bed maybe by 1.30 or 2.  Wow, you just live differently.  Yeah.  I would panic if I was in bed at 1230.  Really?  I was like completely panic.  I was in bed by 10.00.  I was in bed by 10.00, 10.15.  My goodness.  So then I got to shut the fuck up.  What I'm about to say is stupid to you.  I'm just mad that the games are on so late. 
[00:06:30]  I want to watch the NBA Finals.  And I watched the first half.  And I'm like, I can't stay up for this shit.  And the Heat were winning by a nice margin.  And Oklahoma with Kevin Durant just kicked their ass in the second half.  I was fully expecting the Heat to win that game.  And coming in today, I was just waiting for the score where John Montone or somebody would say, yeah, the Heat won.  And it turns out they kicked their fucking ass in the second half.  You didn't have the hours of a fifth grader, apparently. 
[00:07:00]  Every once in a while, I'll push it.  It's sleepy time.  But every once in a while, I'll push it and I'll stay up.  But in general, I just can't do it.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, I sleep the second I get home.  And you sleep for a long time, right?  It's at least two hours, at least.  But usually it's three hours.  Wow, that's nice.  I'll get a little nap in after the show.  But maybe I should just fucking stop being a girl and stay up and watch the whole game.  Watch the game.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself. 
[00:07:30]  It's okay.  It's okay.  But, I mean, this is a great sports story.  I know you don't like basketball, but you got the Heat in the finals again.  And LeBron James, everyone is looking at him like, when are you going to win your fucking ring, idiot?  And I said it already, so I have to say it again.  I do want Oklahoma to win this.  I absolutely do.  I don't want the Heat to win a championship ever.  Fuck that.  Well, the whole team was built just to do that.  So it's like, eh.  You don't want to actually see them win if they were built just to win like that. 
[00:08:00]  I go back to that dumb press conference when most of Cleveland just assumed LeBron was  re-signing just how he was doing it.  And he basically said, fuck you, Cleveland.  The last thing in Cleveland.  And then I got to hear again, he had every right.  I know he had every right to move on.  It's the way he did it that I obsess about.  That's all.  Of course he had the right to move on to a bigger city where he wanted to play. 
[00:08:30]  And not Cleveland.  But a lot of people had a problem the way he did it.  So, whatever.  But they're down one game to Zippo the Heat.  Will they play 28 games or something?  Yeah, well, I think this year they're playing 13 in the finals.  I don't want them to win because Bosch was a dick to me when I met him.  You met Chris Bosch.  I met him and LeBron and Wade were at the show.  But I met Chris Bosch at a hotel right by Lincoln Center.  I was shooting for Leno.  I was doing a piece on the fashion show. 
[00:09:00]  So, he happened to be in there.  There's nobody around him except his reps.  And I'm like, can I take a picture with him?  He goes, no, no, no.  And he walked out.  I was like, you fucking ugly cocksucker.  I didn't say that to him.  I was like, what a douche.  So, now I want to see him lose.  I love that's why Jimmy wants to see him lose.  I know.  They're all dicks probably though.  Yeah.  You just haven't run into the rest of them.  My only interaction with LeBron.  He was cool.  You got that picture with the seller.  But that was because of Kevin.  So, I don't know how that would have been if Kevin hadn't actually texted him first.  That might not have been.  Actors, singers, or athletes. 
[00:09:30]  Athletes are the worst.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  We even know that.  Who knows?  At times, they can be.  Man, in our little world, we know that.  Yeah.  I mean, like, trying to get pictures and stuff like that.  I think actors are the nicest for whatever.  Of the three.  Actors, musicians, athletes.  I got it.  I think so.  Yeah.  Because anybody, here's the difference.  Actors don't have usually screaming live audiences.  Musicians are used to having gigantic live audiences, so they become a bit more squeamish.  And athletes have giant fucking audiences who are a lot of times yelling horrible shit at them. 
[00:10:00]  So, I'm looking at the level of public interaction.  I'm actually thinking about this for the first time as I'm saying this.  That actually makes sense though.  Well, half their season, they have to deal with haters.  You're so right.  You forget.  They don't.  You know, when you go see a rock band, everyone's there because they love you.  Yeah.  I mean, these guys play in away arenas where they just have to hear, like Jimmy said, I'm  repeating, but it's a great point.  They hate people.  Worth repeating.  I never thought about that until we just said it. 
[00:10:30]  And it just makes sense.  But it's true.  Yeah.  I never thought of it that way either.  Because, you know, if you go see a movie, you want to see, you know, the movie itself,  the actors in the movie.  So, you're supportive.  Stadiums of people just booing your name.  Yeah, man.  Boo.  Fuck you.  You suck.  Like, last night, I would bet maybe there were 10 LeBron James fans in that whole arena  for the first game of the NBA Finals.  I'm hoping I don't get caught up in making a good point and then just keep making the 
[00:11:00]  same point, but now I'll make it poorly.  Queen of England, right?  You can't meet her.  Because everybody yells to the Queen.  Oh, no, you're trying to, like, put it into every context.  You can't make better points.  I just ruin it.  I like that point.  I never thought of it that way either.  It's so simple.  Sam, write that down for the after show.  Wait, did you meet Dwayne Wade?  He was there, but I didn't because...  Wait, at the cellar?  He came in with LeBron?  A bunch of them did.  Yeah, they all came in to see Aziz one night.  You didn't get Dwayne Wade's picture?  Nah, I wasn't 100% sure he was there.  LeBron was the big one. 
[00:11:30]  That was the one I really wanted.  But Wade is fucking pretty massive.  When you see my LeBron picture, Dwayne Wade is in the background.  Does he really?  Yeah, he's like, you can see him and I think it might have been Basha actually talking.  There was three of the five or four of the five came in together.  That's pretty cool.  But I was like...  I would take a LeBron James picture in a second.  Because of the way I got the LeBron picture, let me see if you can see it.  Right back, those guys are in the background right there.  You can just see two silhouettes in the background, yeah.  It's just darkness back there. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, they're in the front of the store.  But I didn't want to embarrass Kevin by being annoying.  Otherwise, I would have walked right up and said, hey, can I get you three together?  And they would have went...  That would have been a huge picture, though.  I know, but I didn't want to...  Again, because you don't want to be a dick...  My buddy hooked it up.  And now you're posing them.  Yeah, it's like...  I took the quick picture and that was enough.  Yeah.  I do have some sense.  When it comes to my friends.  A little bit.  So, there you go.  Oklahoma.  Oklahoma City.  Up one game to Zippo.  What was the score?  They won by like 13 points or something like that. 
[00:12:30]  11 points.  They were down the entire game.  I was shocked.  It was old school, having to wait till the morning to get your score.  Yeah, look at that.  Your score.  So...  Do you think that guy really slept with LeBron's mother?  Or is that just total bullshit?  I don't know.  It just seems really strange how that all came to an end.  And him ripping off his jersey like, ugh, I'm done with Cleveland and this team.  I don't know.  I have no idea. 
[00:13:00]  Hmm.  Me and Patrice used to talk about that.  He's convinced it happens.  Oh, he thinks it happens?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I also saw the Paul Williams movie and I know it's a week too fucking late, but that was  a good movie.  It was good, right?  Yeah.  I almost called him because he gave me his card with his cell number.  I should have done it.  It would have been hilarious.  Hey, I just saw your movie.  I just want to say it was really good.  And he went, oh, thanks, man.  Thanks.  And he went, all right.  Take it easy.  Take care.  I didn't ask for his number.  He gave it to me. 
[00:13:30]  He wants to play golf.  But as I see in that movie, wow, he's not a good golfer.  That would be a long day.  He's hacking.  Not that I'm all right.  I'm all right.  But I can keep the ball going.  I can't see as how he gets much leverage on his swing.  No.  You know, I think the taller you are, the longer your arms are and things like that, you get  a little more leverage on that swing.  Right.  You kill a little guy.  Yeah.  It's called Still Alive.  And Steve Kessler, right?  Kessler. 
[00:14:00]  Kessler?  Yeah, I think so.  He did a very good job, but I was frustrated because there is a story there that Paul Williams  doesn't really want to tell.  Yeah, I think so.  He went away when, I was telling Alive before the show, this guy was on every show which  they show you in the movie, and then in the early 80s, he was just gone.  That's 30 years ago.  So around 35 to 38 years old, he is done as far as being an A-lister on all these shows.  What happened?  The drugs and the drinking, I bet.  I know, but he didn't officially really say what happened. 
[00:14:30]  Did they just stop calling out of nowhere?  Was it a slow fade?  Did he spread himself too thin?  And he was overexposed?  I would love to know what that first moment is when you just, who told us a little bit  about it?  What actor?  Ralph Macchio.  I said, when did you first notice it?  Because I was curious.  He goes, it was during My Cousin Vinny.  He had to fight to get in for the audition.  And that was a big hit for him.  But that was the moment where he saw the shift. 
[00:15:00]  And I would love to have known.  Right.  Because it always happens.  There's always that moment.  Because again, he did 48 Tonight Shows, Paul Williams.  He was fucking, he was everywhere.  Yeah.  I mean, you're right.  I mean, everywhere.  The end of the movie was kind of cool when he was going through his storage bin.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  With all his old tapes.  Yeah, his videotapes.  And it was sad when you finally saw his home and you would expect the guy that won an Oscar  with Barbra Streisand to be living in a better spot.  It wasn't a bad house.  It was just small.  Just a regular house, right? 
[00:15:30]  Not much to it, really.  I hope he has money.  He has to have publishing money because he made some big fucking songs, man.  I told Ann, I think his ex-wife probably, you know, took a massive chunk away from him.  Right.  He probably does make pretty good money, but still had to pay off a lot of people for a  while there.  But weren't you happy?  There's one time I was really happy for him when he was singing in the Philippines.  It was a massive audience.  Oh, yeah.  I loved him.  He's huge in the Philippines.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  He never had a really good singing voice.  No, he had an average singing voice.  And I was amazed because he's on Carson and all these shows that were massive for the time. 
[00:16:00]  And I'm thinking, why would they allow him to sing?  Because his voice is kind of weak.  Very weak.  He wrote great songs, obviously.  But when he sang them, it didn't have the same oof.  But they allowed him to sing those songs.  And he had that weird inflection in his voice where it's almost like his nose was more...  What was his big song that he would sing?  And yet an old-fashioned love song.  That's how he sang it in the movie.  Coming down in three-part harmony. 
[00:16:30]  Me and my brother and sister used to go find him all the time.  We grew up singing Paul Williams songs like Paul Williams around the house and cracking  each other up.  Really?  Yeah, because it was just the funniest thing, the way he sang.  And yet an old-fashioned love song.  Playing on the ready more.  Wrapped around the music.  And he wrote for everybody.  Yeah.  He even wrote for David Bowie, but the song never went anywhere that I know of. 
[00:17:00]  This song was huge for three-dog guys.  Oh, my God.  That's where you've heard it before, is it slowly...  Paul Williams.  Slowly.  Slowly.  Slowly.  Slowly.  There it is.  There it is.  Gone, Billy, gone.  Gone.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Coming down in three-part harmony.  You know it's Paul Williams.  Oh, yeah.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  The voice is really weak.  I like it.  That's weird. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Now play what Three Dog Nights did with this song.  Just to show you the difference.  Yeah.  Low.  Low.  Low.  And the Carpenters song.  Well, which one did he write for them again?  Oh, they're huge fucking...  Oh, let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  I don't know.  This Two Dog Nights, right?  Same song.  Yeah.  That old fucking keyboard sound.  Just to know...  Look how nice that is. 
[00:18:00]  It's nice and up front.  I know.  Yeah.  There's no...  No.  You don't hear his nose.  You don't hear...  No.  Promising that we'll never go...  Honestly, and I'm not trying to be a different guy.  I like Paul Wayne's version better.  You know this guy probably has a better voice.  Paul Wayne's got a weird thing with it.  It is weird.  Love song.  It's just enjoyable.  Now it kicks in.  Yeah, wait for this to kick in now.  Just an old-fashioned love song. 
[00:18:30]  One I'm sure they wrote for you and me.  You and me.  And me.  Me.  And just an old-fashioned love song.  You're coming down in three-parts coming, yeah.  Three-parts.  There's a clip of him coming out on the Tonight Show singing.  It might have been this song.  But he's got his little suit on.  His little suit.  It's just great.  It was a little long hair.  I'm like, what a bad thing, man.  It was rainy days and Mondays.  Thank you.  Rainy days and Mondays.  From Connecticut.  And I learned through this movie, and I wish I fucking got to see it so I could tell him 
[00:19:00]  personally.  But I will call him today.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to now for the radio show.  I'll let you know how it goes.  Oh, thank you for the call.  Oh, P.  Oh, P.  He wrote that for a TV spot.  Really?  It was in the movie.  The Carpenter's Song.  Yeah.  He wrote that in a bank or something.  It was like kind of a jingle in a commercial.  And then the Carpenters supposedly saw it on TV and said, what the fuck?  This could be a hit.  That's something.  And called Paul Williams and said, we want to do that song that you wrote for the commercial. 
[00:19:30]  Let me sing it for you.  That's a hell of a voice.  This is The Carpenter's Song.  I was never a fan, but what a voice.  That puke breath on the microphone.  Oh, okay.  Sing it, you skeleton.  She had a piece of ham in her teeth.  I'm singing it, you skeleton. 
[00:20:00]  I forgot you were anorexic.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  It was crazy anorexic.  They're still cleaning up puke.  How could I forget?  That's funny.  It's the name of the Carpenters and she died looking like a piece of molding.  Yeah, she's all woody, right?  Exactly, Chip.  This reminds me of being in, like, the car when I was a kid going to Grandma's house or something. 
[00:20:30]  All these songs that I was playing, being a child of the 80s.  I'm not a fan of the over-the-top sad song.  No?  Nah, it's too sad.  Really?  After, like, a breakup?  Put this on and just feel bad about yourself?  Yeah, actually.  Why did she leave me?  You're a fucking bitch!  I'm going to get married!  What happened?  You're 15.  You don't even understand feelings yet.  It's supposed to be forever!  Right.  What?  Really?  At fucking... 
[00:21:00]  14?  Right.  There's, uh...  This type of stuff reminds me of my mother smoking Benson and Hedges.  Benson and Hedges?  That's what she smoked.  And the smell of the fucking cigarette when it first got lit was a nice smell.  And then after that, it was awful.  Oh, wow.  That's fucking...  The very first whiff of smoke was okay.  But the ones after that were disgusting.  Yeah.  There was one thing in this movie that definitely confused me.  They showed a quick clip of Quentin Tarantino talking about how he loved 
[00:21:30]  Ishtar?  Oh, yeah.  Is that a true...  A true thing?  Probably.  Quentin's weird.  He's a weird guy.  But everyone basically talks about how that's the worst movie ever made, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Why did he love it?  Does anyone know out there?  Because he's a weirdo.  But maybe there's something there.  Maybe we should all watch Ishtar again after, uh...  After, uh, knowing that.  Kirk, what's up, buddy?  Do it.  Do it.  Watch Ishtar again.  Those songs that they wrote together, they were a bad songwriting team. 
[00:22:00]  That was part of the movie.  I don't know why at Bond, because they were so fucking funny together.  Who's in Ishtar?  I love Ishtar.  Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty.  Now, Warren Beatty had that one, and he also had Heaven Can Wait.  Was that a bomb or a huge success?  That was a success.  No, Heaven's Gate was the bad one.  Oh, right.  I'm sorry.  Heaven's Gate was the bomb.  Heaven Can Wait was big.  Oh, right.  You just tell it.  Who was in Heaven's Gate?  Oh, shit.  Uh, shit.  Well, Warren Beatty and...  Christ, I can't remember.  Was he in Heaven's Gate, too?  He was in Heaven's Gate? 
[00:22:30]  No, Heaven Can Wait.  Right.  He is a football player.  What's the difference between the two movies?  I know the story.  How about Heaven's Overweight?  Something out of Wait?  A Gate?  Uh, what's the difference between the two movies?  I haven't thought of this in years.  What, Heaven's Gate and Heaven's Can Wait?  Yeah, yeah.  Heaven Can Wait.  Way different movies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I understand, but...  I don't know what Heaven's Gate is about.  I don't either.  I never saw it.  Okay.  Or how much it lost.  It was a huge...  It was like the biggest bomb in Hollywood at one point ever.  Yeah, it was terrible.  Yeah.  H-Star was, and I don't know, I mean...  But Quentin Tarantino supposedly loved the movie, and I just want to know why. 
[00:23:00]  Really?  I never heard that.  I personally always loved it, because the songwriting was so bad on purpose.  Oh.  Hold on!  And it was just hilarious.  Chris Christopherson.  Thank you, Chris.  Christopher Walken, John Hurt.  Wow.  Sam Watterson.  Brad Dourif, who was Billy Bibbitt in Cuckoo's Nest.  Oh, man.  There's a lot of very...  Jeff Bridges is in this.  Joseph Cotton is an old actor.  Go down a little more, Sam.  Jeff Bridges.  A lot of fucking big names in this. 
[00:23:30]  And it just fucking bombed.  Yeah.  That's probably why it costs so much.  It was about a gate maker.  It was about a guy who was making a gate, and Christopher Walken probably painted the  gate, and the other guy would, wrought iron gate making, and they were trying to get it  to heaven, but no one would go.  Jeff Bridges is the UPS driver, who's like, we don't have the technology to go up there  into the heavens.  It was a terrible, terrible mockumentary.  Horrible, horrible, horrible story, but a gate maker.  Box office, $44 million?  That was the budget. 
[00:24:00]  The budgeted, $44 million.  The opening weekend was $12,000.  $12,000?  The gross was $3.4 million.  Wow.  How do you open with $12,000 with that cast?  Well, I mean...  Wow.  Movie tickets were $1.50 back then.  What was it up against?  I know.  That's something I want to know.  What year was it?  Let's guess.  What the fuck was it up against?  Late 70s, right?  79.  Was it in Star Wars, or not in 77?  How about The Empire Strikes Back?  Was it 77?  No.  It was 79.  Oh, 79? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, it could be Empire...  I'm going to go with Ordinary People.  What?  It was 80.  80?  Sorry, maybe Raging Bull, Ordinary People.  Animal House was around there, right?  I think that was 78.  There's nothing it could be up against without explaining 12 grand.  Right.  I'm going to go Jaws 2.  It could be.  Jaws 2.  It came out the same weekend.  Yeah.  Rainy days and Mondays always. 
[00:25:00]  Always get me down.  Now all I'm thinking of is an old-fashioned love song.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Coming down in three-part harmony.  No idea?  All right.  It's not that big of a deal, right?  He can't find it.  I'm sure somebody will find it.  Rainy on the radio.  Rainy?  Rainy?  Rainy?  Rainy?  Rainy?  Rainy?  Rainy?  Rainy?  Rainy?  Rainy?  Elephant Man?  And wrapped around the music is the sound of someone promising they'll never go. 
[00:25:30]  Never go.  What was he thinking?  Oh, no.  It's great, though.  You'll swear you've heard it before as it slowly rambles on and on.  On and on.  No need in bringing them back because they've never been gone.  Billy.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Coming down in three-part harmony.  Harmony. 
[00:26:00]  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Yeah.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  When I'm sure to go for you and me.  Weave our dreams upon and listen to each evening when the lights are low.  Low.  Da.  Do underscore our love affair with tenderness and feelings that we've come to know.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  You'll swear you've heard it before as it slowly rambles on and on. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  No need in bringing them back because I've never been on.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Coming down in three-part harmony.  Little teeny suit.  His little suit.  It's a mic stand that doesn't go down low enough.  Yeah.  1980, that was, you're saying?  Wow. 
[00:27:00]  Empire.  Okay.  E.T.  Well, that moved to okay, I guess.  Oh, no, it did really well.  Yeah, Empire, E.T.  So maybe they should read.  Batman.  Batman?  Somebody said Batman.  Batman?  What?  What are they talking about?  Batman.  1980, Batman.  Who's giving me erroneous information?  Hold on, hold on, someone's getting bounced.  E.T.  was 82.  I don't take erroneous information.  E.T.  was 82?  I believe so.  That's just a rough guess.  Someone said 82. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  I'm not fucking listening to you people anymore.  Or I'm bouncing you.  Who the fuck's in Batman?  Was it the made-for-TV movie Batman?  I trust you people to give me proper information.  They make an asshole out of you.  If we break that trust, I must bounce you.  It's an avatar?  Or?  Honest mistake, fuck you.  How is that an honest mistake?  November 1980, Heaven's Gate, The Idol Maker, which was a Ray Sharky movie, and Raging Bull. 
[00:28:00]  I mean, Raging Bull was a massive success, but it wasn't, you know, a box office juggernaut  like Star Wars.  So they had a pretty good slot.  Yeah, I would say so.  Wow.  They had an opportunity to do pretty well.  The Idol Maker.  It did not.  How did that do?  Well, the next month, you had, um...  Yeah, but next month, you know.  Yeah.  Two weeks later is a long time in the movie business.  That is.  That is.  Flash Gordon, stir crazy.  God, I remember my grandmother took me in New York to see that. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, did she?  Any Which Way You Can, which was a Clint Eastwood follow-up movie.  Oh.  Nine to Five.  Nine to Five, which I saw in the movie theaters, my friend.  Working nine to five.  My friend Dean Miller took me to see that at the mall.  What a way to make a living.  I want to sing everything like Paul Williams.  December of 1980, it was cold, and we went, fuck, man.  Oh.  Wow.  It's the plight of the woman.  It's like, oh, what are you doing today?  Struggling in the kitchen.  I stumbled out of bed and I stumbled into the kitchen. 
[00:29:00]  I stumbled into the kitchen.  For myself a cup of ambition.  Ah, that's coffee.  Is it?  A cup of ambition.  It's cum.  Yeah, it's cocky.  Nice and thick.  Jesus.  It's like lard that fucking hardens up.  Dabney Coleman played the boss.  Oh, he certainly did.  Who was in this?  Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton.  Jane Fonda.  Fonda.  Hanoi Jane. 
[00:29:30]  She's all sad about being called Hanoi Jane now.  You said Dabney?  Dabney Coleman played the boss, yeah.  Dabney Coleman.  He was a great character.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Loved him.  Fucking Wargames.  He's been at some amazing movies.  Wargames is great.  He's got a scene in there where he tells Matthew Broderick, he's like, no charges have been filed.  Yet.  He does it a little sniff thing and looks away and goes, yet.  It's like a perfect character actor-y thing to do.  He's very good in that.  And also Sterling Hayden. 
[00:30:00]  I didn't realize he was in this.  He was, of course, McCluskey in The Godfather.  Oh.  Who else?  I don't know.  McCluskey.  McCluskey.  All right, Mercer.  It's amazing when you look down some of these older movies, when you look at the very...  Like, I think the last guy in the credits for Escape from Alcatraz is Danny Glover.  Wow.  No kidding.  He had one line.  I thought I told all you guineas...  I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up.  Danny hoods locked up.  I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up.  Too old for my job.  Getting cranky. 
[00:30:30]  So she doesn't like being called Hanoi Jane now.  No, she...  No, she wants to move on from that.  Yeah, well...  Well, we're not ready.  Sorry.  So fuck you.  A lot of Vietnam vets aren't ready.  Sorry to America.  Fuck you.  Sitting on an anti-aircraft gun in fucking Hanoi.  Yeah, but didn't she say that our guys were lying about being tortured?  Oh, yeah.  As they were being tortured?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you don't move on from that.  Sorry.  No.  That's something that's going to be with you for a while longer.  Sorry.  Sorry.  You just got to take along with you. 
[00:31:00]  Just be happy you weren't tried for treason because it was a fucking police action, not  a war, you rotten cunt.  They were trying to say last week she was at some kind of premiere that she looks really  hot.  How old is she?  She's like 70.  She does look good.  She was here one day.  Yeah?  Would you...  Yes, I would.  I got a photo with her.  You would.  So I had an interaction with her.  For the story.  No, because she's actually not bad.  And I'm not into older broads at all, but she looks pretty good.  Honestly.  She's great.  The Jane Fonda workout takes, man.  She has a body.  If she was just like fucking Martha Fonda, I don't think I'd...  Maybe.  I think I would do Jane Fonda, not for the story, just to do it. 
[00:31:30]  And I would do Betty White for the story.  Yes.  God.  That's more of a, you have to do it for the story.  I don't know about that.  Jane Fonda might be on the border of just doing it because you want to.  Ain't no way.  I'm fucking no 70 year old woman.  Would you let her suck your dick?  Her cunt don't do it.  Her age.  Her pussy is probably such a fucking dick gripper because all those workout tapes.  You think that's a dick gripper?  A grab a gripper?  What?  At 70?  Yeah, dick gripper.  At 70? 
[00:32:00]  No way.  I bet her pussy sounds...  It's C74.  Her pussy probably sounds like the Ropers theme song while you're...  When it's gripping your dick.  That's probably the sound of it.  This is the actual sound of having sex with Jane Fonda.  Sure.  It's like...  Just that part.  In.  Out.  In.  No, it's the...  Yeah.  It goes...  She...  Yeah, I can't see that as being a dick gripper at 70.  Yeah.  That's like when you have prolapse.  She might need a fucking vaginal sling. 
[00:32:30]  You're not a fan of the vaginal sling?  No.  Like that fucking...  What are you talking about?  Like the...  The little rascal's cake.  Right.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Where's your picture with Jane Fonda?  I want to see what she looks like, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Hanoi Jim.  Hopefully...  Yeah.  Hanoi Jim.  No, but I said something after to the troops.  Oh, God.  You're pretty much a communist.  Yeah.  You're just having a picture with her.  Guilt by association.  That's right.  Let me see if I have it on here.  I might.  We got it here at Sirius, and she was coming... 
[00:33:00]  I had to fly.  So she was coming in very late, and I just got her at the door.  Oh.  And she was a little bit nonplussed, I'll tell you that.  Is that her now?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, you know, she keeps herself in good shape.  Well, you got the plastic surgery, I wouldn't mind cramming it where the fuckin' duty comes  out if you don't.  Oh, God.  Seventy years of shit pouring out of that?  Yeah, well, if you know...  Come on.  That's gotta look abused.  I bet there's Preparation H in her medicine cabinet.  Look in that medicine cabinet sometimes.  Oh, boy.  It's the world of hurt, right?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:33:30]  I know Seinfeld did a thing on that where he saw the fungus, anti-fungus thing that ended  up being for her cat, but when you look in a medicine cabinet, when you snoop around  a girl's place or something, and you see like, see like Prep H and fuckin' some kind  of other shit, you're just like, oh, God.  Just don't see Valtrex.  I got the anti-fungus shit.  Yeah?  I got a little athlete's foot happening right now as I sit here.  Oh, Jesus.  It's a little itchy.  You're a guy that's not as bad for a guy.  It's a little itchy right now.  Isn't that from, like, how do you get that? 
[00:34:00]  Being lazy.  I do a lot of bike riding and stuff and keep my sweaty socks on.  Oh, Jesus.  It's going to be in a nice environment to go shit.  It sure isn't from having piss on your sock from the toilet ring for him.  I know, it's not.  Yeah.  I went to the skin doctor and she had to point it out.  Oh, and you got some athletes.  All right, thank you.  Wow.  You didn't have to point it out, I knew.  It's from being an athlete.  Yeah.  You got the athlete's foot.  That's where the body comes from.  That's right.  Where's the pic?  I don't know if I have it here.  My phone doesn't, I sync them with my phone and they don't sometimes all sync on the phone. 
[00:34:30]  How about everything but the kitchen sink?  Fucking double guns, Comia.  Fuck, I was going to say bathroom sink.  Motherfucker.  Oh.  Sorry, Chip.  Why did you say that?  I'm sorry, Chip.  You could use that, though.  Okay.  I guess the point is the Paul Williams movie, even though it doesn't matter anymore because  he's long gone, was good.  I liked it.  Yeah, I liked it.  I really liked the clips of him on the old shows, Merv and stuff like that, Mike Douglas. 
[00:35:00]  Well, I mean, just the Johnny Carson stuff.  Yeah.  And, you know, a lot of people, especially the younger people, they had no idea that when  Johnny Carson was on, the whole country watched.  Everyone watched.  At the same time, too.  Yeah.  We didn't DVR it.  We don't watch stuff at the same time anymore.  We don't even listen to the radio show at the same time.  We have a massive audience that only listens to the replay.  Yeah.  And you didn't live tweet anything.  You were pretty much with whoever you were with at that point watching the show, but you 
[00:35:30]  knew everyone else in the country was pretty much watching, too.  Right.  A weird vibe, that whole thing.  And then you talk about it the next day.  Right.  At work or school or whatever.  And you felt kind of out of touch.  What's the...  Like, kind of...  You felt...  I want to say out of touch, but that's not really it.  Left Out?  Left Out, I guess.  Yeah, of course.  If you didn't watch it?  Yeah.  The next day at work, if you didn't watch, you're like, oh, fuck.  Everybody else watched.  And they're all talking about it, right? 
[00:36:00]  Yes.  Yes.  I was eating sushi last night with a friend of mine, and I had forgotten my phone in  the car, and I'm like, as we're walking, I'm like, I forgot my phone.  She's like, do you want to go back for it?  And I'm like, no, no, no.  It's okay.  Just to make myself eat without my fucking phone.  Oh, how was it?  It was fine, but I mean, we were just yapping.  This is a comic, so it didn't...  It wasn't, you know...  It's hard to leave the phone behind, but when you do, every once in a while, it's not  bad.  Yeah?  I kind of like it.  It's always thinking, like, eh.  And then the second you get it, though, you're like, ah, you got to catch up.  Of course, you got to catch up. 
[00:36:30]  Catch up on everything.  But it's not bad to just leave it behind every once in a while.  I missed nothing.  And those, like, you know, when there's a moment in the conversation, I'm looking for  this picture, where you're not talking, it's okay to not just glance down at your  phone.  Or if someone goes to the bathroom, it's okay to just sit there and think.  Like, instead of going, fuck Google, Google, Google, Twitter, Twitter, Google, text, Twitter,  email, email, Google, Twitter, text, stock market, even though it's closed.  Stock market, Twitter, Google, text, text, Google.  Right, you got it.  How much stimulation do I need? 
[00:37:00]  And she's only gone for a minute.  That's fucking perfect.  That's what you do.  Here's what I do.  I open my phone.  What do I got?  All right, I got text.  I got stocks.  I got the quick YouTube.  I got an email.  Oh, quick.  Let me just check my phone and see if I have any missed calls.  Let me go to my echo, echo phone.  Let me go to the Twitter app.  Fuck me.  Endless.  Yeah.  And then we just make plans to go somewhere so we can be on our phones.  Why don't we even make plans at this point?  Dude, it's so silly.  You make plans with someone and you both sit there at a table on your phone. 
[00:37:30]  On the phone.  It's like, well, we could have probably just stayed home.  It is fucking just weird, man.  I don't know.  We're in a weird transitional phase here.  Yeah, I hope it becomes something a little different.  I don't know what it is.  The whole personal one-on-one interaction thing is pretty dead.  It's gone, right?  It really is gone.  Like, we talk about this the past couple weeks, how it's not even rude anymore.  It's just not even rude to fucking...  It went from being really rude to accepted quickly.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Really quickly.  Yeah.  Fucking going back a $100 million deal.  Yeah.  Jesus.  This fucking...  Who is...  He's a lunatic, too.  He's crazy.  Mrs. Voorhees on TV.  Who the fuck is that?  That's Ann Myers.  Ann Myers, Drysdale.  She's, uh...  Mrs. Voorhees.  She looks like Mrs. Voorhees.  Write a book, Mommy.  Write a book.  Yeah, people aren't born gay.  Okay.  What happened?  Keep believing that.  Uh-oh.  Oh, her.  Is she?  Well...  She looks a little manly.  Maybe I shouldn't say that, but...  She looks a little masculine. 
[00:38:30]  She looks way more manly than womanly.  Open door for future female athletes.  Well, yeah, that's...  She is a large woman.  Holy shit.  She's more manly than me.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I don't know if she's gay.  I shouldn't have said that.  I have no fucking idea.  I don't know, but...  And if she is, whatever.  I don't care.  I think you could say that in New York.  What?  That someone looks gay.  Yeah, you could say that who looks gay.  It's not slander.  Say it like Sam looks gay.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  There's nothing he could do about it, especially because it's absolutely true.  He's a flaming homosexual.  Hey, knock it off.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  But you like to lick a lot of pussy, don't you?  Why do you get this tar trailer up there?  You're talking about his tar?  No, but...  Two hours ago.  You have it at a point.  Two hours ago.  Bag of shit.  No, was there something you found?  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I found it.  You found Jane Fong?  Yeah, it was...  Yeah.  She's in...  Look at the shape she's in, and look at old fat neck.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[00:39:30]  That's good.  Yeah.  She looks good, though, man.  She looks just like, you know, some broad.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  You would do that.  Yeah, absolutely.  You wouldn't do that, Ann, huh?  Well, I don't know.  I might...  Say you're horny, a little lonely.  Yeah, I probably would.  You've got a little horned up.  You've had a few pops.  Yeah, I probably would.  There's nothing going on on your phone at the time.  Yeah, I probably would.  She knocks on your door.  What do you do?  Eh, you've got to fuck Jane Fonda.  What kind of breath do you think she has?  Not bad.  She's been a celebrity for so long, she's probably decent. 
[00:40:00]  I'd lambast her about Vietnam.  Oh, yeah, of course.  The whole time.  While I fucked her.  Fucking do you, bitch.  Doing it for Sal and for Manny.  Manny.  God damn motherfuckers.  Yeah, you love Elias.  She'd be like, what?  I'm now water walker.  She's reading her pussy.  Everybody say, everybody say, everybody say, cock a dog, we say.  Yeah, just keep giving her little reminders. 
[00:40:30]  Yes.  Very scary.  Very scary headline about a guy we all don't like.  Aiming for mayor of the world.  Bloomberg's next act.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What do you think he'll do?  Is he trying to be a super mayor or?  Will he go for the presidency eventually?  He's getting too old for that.  I don't know, man.  That's a tough nut.  He's going after popcorn next.  Him and his health officials.  Popcorn?  There it is right there, brother.  What the fuck's the problem with popcorn?  City health weasels go pop. 
[00:41:00]  Pop goes the weasel.  Okay, I get it.  So they're going from the sugary drinks, and now they're going for your buttery movie theater popcorn.  Fucking assholes.  See, every time you fucking give them one thing, it takes something else.  You know, you taught me that.  Yeah.  You really did.  You can't budge on any of this shit, because they never stop.  That's why you've got to fight and fight them, and people are like...  Even on the dumb stuff.  Oh, you know, there's got to be compromises made and stuff.  Sometimes you've just got to stand your ground and fight, because the second you give them 
[00:41:30]  something, they don't pack their bags and leave.  They go to the next thing, and then you're just fucked.  Well, they're going after, the popcorn isn't a whole lot better than the soda.  He works for the mayor's office.  The board yesterday agreed to put Bloomberg's big soda ban up for a public hearing.  July 24th.  Ridiculous.  It's embarrassing.  You know why?  Because you're not fucking every day getting a giant thing of popcorn and eating it. 
[00:42:00]  If you go into the movies and you get one of those amazingly giant sodas and popcorns,  you're at the movies.  Most people just do it every once in a while.  Moderation is fine, even if it's a binging moderation.  Right.  You know, if you just go to the movies and get that, it's not going to be an issue.  But you see what an elitist pig he is, because he can have his mayo all over as a BLT, but  I eat them sparingly.  Well, so do most fucking people, asshole.  And the fat people are going to be fat whether or not you regulate their soda size. 
[00:42:30]  So what you're doing is you're telling regular people that they can't have it, but you can  handle BLTs.  You can handle it, but regular people can't.  That's pretty much every law that's made.  It's legislation is against law-abiding citizens that just, you know, going around living their  lives.  And then whoever the law is supposed to be against doesn't pay attention to the law.  So they're saving their jobs.  How many calories in a big, huge tub of movie theater popcorn?  I'm going to guess 1,200.  I'm going to say 5,000. 
[00:43:00]  Wow.  That's too many.  1,650.  It's a lot.  I like the Bloomberg put the calorie counts up, though.  I like that.  And then Anthony Bourdain goes, well, that hasn't changed people's habits.  Well, too fucking bad.  It's not our job to change people's habits.  It's not our job to inform people.  Exactly.  I completely disagree with that.  In my dumb little world, it changed how I eat.  I used to like a few different things at Starbucks.  And then when they put the calories up, I'm like, fuck, I can't eat that every day.  You've got to keep... 
[00:43:30]  Fuck yeah, this is sick.  It works.  You kind of know, though, that it's not good for you.  I don't know.  You could look at something and go, ah, you know what?  I don't need numbers on that to tell me that I probably shouldn't eat the whole thing.  But they trick you by saying low-fat or something.  Yeah, well...  So you see something that says low-fat and you taste it, you go, you know what?  This is low-fat.  It tastes pretty good.  All right.  And then they finally put the calories up and it's 800 calories.  Yeah.  Like the regular version would be well over 1,000 is all they're saying.  It's just lower, yeah.  Yeah, but 800 calories for a dumb piece of cake is a lot. 
[00:44:00]  Reduced fat.  If you give a shit about, you know, how you eat.  Yeah.  Yeah, they use all those tricky words, but it doesn't really mean...  Very tricky.  ...that you're eating that healthy.  But I like the fact that he did that.  But people who are obese are not always just drinking large...  Like, he's such a dumb asshole.  And I know it's just the start.  They binge at home.  If you want to stop obesity, here's what you do.  You don't penalize people who can handle it.  You stop covering people with insurance and you make them pay out of pocket. 
[00:44:30]  Like, that's the way it is.  Like, insurance companies a lot of times now are making you sign things saying you don't smoke.  Because they don't want to have to fucking pay for you putting...  Right.  And I don't blame them.  That's why I don't blame insurance companies.  Right.  Yeah.  So that's what we should do with obesity.  Well, they're going to try to go after the popcorn now.  And the soda thing they're going to vote on in September, it looks like.  You don't think that's going to go through, right?  I don't know.  Well, who could tell anymore?  Fucking mayor we got.  Nice.  Her honor.  Yeah, her honor.  Exactly. 
[00:45:00]  I was on...  What was I on?  Crossing, like, 25th Street last night.  And it's a west to east street.  And it's fucking three lanes.  It's one lane now.  People are parked, and then you have two lanes of white lines with, like, what would you say?  It's like two parallel lines with, like, letter H lines, meaning you can't drive there.  Yeah, you're not allowed to drive.  It's like, get the fuck out of this lane line.  Oh, my God.  Is he a fucking twat? 
[00:45:30]  He just, he really...  What was their reason?  I don't know.  He detests...  I'm going to tell you, he has no respect for the middle class or people who drive.  Yeah.  Because he doesn't have to.  Yep.  Fucking stinks.  I can't stand that.  Uh, Ryan's got a weird question for you.  Ryan.  Uh, Ryan.  I don't know if it's a weird question, but how are you talking about people should, you  know, know what bad things are put in them?  You fucking put toxins in your body nightly and drink yourself into the stupor.  What are you fucking talking about, bro?  I don't think I drink myself into a stupor every night, but, um, I do, uh, partake in 
[00:46:00]  alcoholic beverages, uh, mostly on the weekends.  Um, but I, I know I'm not making excuses.  I'm not saying, boy, they should put something on the side of this bottle.  Let me know.  And it doesn't matter what they put on the side of the bottle.  They put warnings and stuff like that.  It doesn't matter.  I'm still going to pour myself a goddamn drink.  Sure.  Yeah.  So yeah, Anthony's make, it's Anthony's business if he does that.  So that's, that's, that's, you're making his, our point actually.  Yeah.  That's why.  Well, because he sits there and says, well, people should, people should know that they're 
[00:46:30]  putting bad things.  Well, you do the same thing.  They should.  They should know.  Yes.  And it's making a choice.  That's what this is all about.  Let the individual make the choice.  Don't, don't, don't have your government telling you what you should eat and drink.  Okay.  That's what I, that's what I think.  Okay.  All you can do is give people the information.  Right.  And that like Anthony has the information.  Yeah.  Alcohol can be bad for you.  He knows that, but he drinks it.  I know certain things are bad.  Opi, that we, we do, we choose to do them anyway. 
[00:47:00]  And then when the consequences come, the consequences come.  One of the consequences for being obese and for eating horribly is that to get certain  insurance coverage, you should be forced to begin losing weight.  If not, your insurance should not have to pay for you shoving food in your fucking face  at a disgusting rate.  Yeah.  All right.  I agree.  I'm not the funny, you know, I just asked the question.  Did you say that though?  I thought you were more about let the people choose what they're doing with their bodies.  That's what I say.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  As long as it's legal shit.  I'm not against more information being out there, like the calorie thing, but all I was  saying is, I wasn't saying take the numbers down.  I said, I just don't need numbers to look at something and you kind of know it's not  good for you.  Yeah.  I didn't say I fucking don't eat it or don't fucking drink it.  I'm just saying you, you do know as a person what is good or bad for you, but you don't  need legislation.  Okay.  Got me your fucking smart ass. 
[00:48:00]  I'm going to go to work.  I love you guys.  Bye, sir.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Love you a little less today.  Thank you so much for your phone call.  It was very informative.  You really liked that one.  Disagrees with Jim.  It doesn't work up here in Boston.  What doesn't work?  The calorie thing, Chuck?  Well, first of all, they just passed a law in Middleborough, Massachusetts that makes  it a civil offense, a fine.  You get fined if you are caught publicly using profanity. 
[00:48:30]  I heard that it's not a law.  I heard they're just talking about it.  No, no.  They just passed it the other day in town council.  Now, again...  Are you sure?  We got to look that up.  Because that's crazy.  It'll never hold up.  No.  Well, you know, that's the argument is that, you know, they can't, you know, they can't,  you know, just, you know, figure out how to monitor that.  And then one of the news reporters had asked, so give me an example of one of the things  that would be considered a, you know, a use of profanity. 
[00:49:00]  And they said, we know it when we'll, when we hear it.  That's the same just pornography argument.  Yeah.  Right.  But, yeah, that'll be challenged the first time someone gets a ticket for it.  What's that got to do with this, though?  Why are we trying to control language in this country?  It's so stupid.  My point is, this is the past, that the fact that it's even being discussed makes me ill.  And I was saying, you know, where I disagree with Jimmy is not on the premise itself.  I mean, if a restaurant wants to compete and they want to get, you know, I mean, there  is a definite, like, market now for healthy foods and stuff like that. 
[00:49:30]  I mean, you could put it up there, but don't force, you know, a business.  If they want to sell shit burgers with, you know, four pounds of mayonnaise on there and  people want to buy it, then, you know, God bless it.  If there's a market for that, you know, that's the free economy.  I agree.  Wait, so you don't want restaurants to be forced to show the calories?  Is that what you're getting at?  Yeah, absolutely.  Why should they?  I actually agree with you.  I do like that I could see, you know, how many calories in some of these dishes, but 
[00:50:00]  I do agree with you.  If you own a restaurant, it's your business.  No, here's why I don't agree with you, bro.  Because I think that, like, the FDA, so that's like saying that you don't want the Food and  Drug Administration to have any say over what gets regulated.  Oh, inspecting your food.  Like, yeah, I like to be informed, and I don't trust big businesses or any businesses enough  to look out for my best interest.  Just, I don't know what they're putting in that food.  Like, the reason I have no mercy for the tobacco companies is because they lied for so many  years about what they knew. 
[00:50:30]  Right.  And they, well, people want to believe certain things.  But you kind of know what's in the food.  Right.  They're not using illegal ingredients.  But when they say, when you see a fucking greasy bacon cheeseburger coming your way  to maybe another table, you already know that's like the worst thing you could eat.  But it's changed my eating habits.  He's not talking like this.  He's just drooling.  Right.  The FDA is their responsibility.  If you go into Starbucks and you get, you know, a drink that's going to cause you to  grow a third nut or something, you know, they're going to step in. 
[00:51:00]  But every, if you go into a supermarket and get bananas and apples and eat that, you know,  24 hours a day, that's not healthy for you either.  Wait, so you're saying you don't want, you don't, so you don't think that products should  put calories or ingredients on the back either?  Like every cookie package does it.  Everything you buy in a supermarket has a calorie count or a package count or, I'm sorry,  you know, a fat count and fiber.  So you don't think that that should be there either? 
[00:51:30]  So we shouldn't be informed about what we're eating?  No, you're right.  You just convinced me.  Oh, I love when that shit happens.  Wow.  That was, I mean, you hit the, I guess that's right, 100%.  Like, I mean, you know, I didn't look at, you know, a restaurant like it's a package.  You know, that's a good point.  You know, a restaurant is nothing more than a food wrapper, I guess, that's, you know,  delivering it.  You just know, though.  I don't know.  Well, like you said about reduced fat stuff, though, dude.  That's hard to know.  I like when a restaurant shows responsibility and will give you the calories, but I don't 
[00:52:00]  really like them being forced to do that.  Hey, Opie, real quick.  If you're ever up in Boston, I do a TV show up here on New England Cable News, and we're  doing a celebrity golf tournament all summer long.  Fuck.  Let's do this.  We want you to bring, you know, Rich Boss or something and play in it.  You play against, like, NBA legends and, you know, a lot of the Boston athletes and things  like that.  But we'd love to have you be part of it.  I was listening to the replay before this show and heard you. 
[00:52:30]  And I'll give you golf clubs, but you don't have to blow me.  Ah, that was pretty funny, yeah.  That was a twisted scenario yesterday.  No, I now could afford my own golf clubs, so I don't have to blow anyone, thank God.  Do you want to put them on hold?  Yeah, I actually would go up there for that.  Hold on, all right?  You bet.  Thank you, man.  Look at that guy pitching.  He's pitching his fucking gig.  I just like playing golf.  I don't need to do it with celebrities.  If it's for a good cause, though, maybe.  I don't mind a good cause, everyone. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, sure.  You've got to be a little fool-thropic.  Is it Burger King or McDonald's with the sundae?  Burger King, the bacon sundae.  Fucking love Burger King now.  When can we try this shit?  Sounds good, right?  Sounds terrible.  Bacon and ice cream don't mix.  I was arguing this with Travis.  Bacon goes with everything.  It does.  Yeah.  Have you ever had bacon and eggs,  and then you have a side bowl of cereal,  and then maybe you have a spoonful of cereal,  and then you're like, oh, a piece of bacon.  You're pretty much mixing it right there. 
[00:53:30]  No.  Well, I don't do that.  It's crazy.  It's only little bits of bacon.  How about you try it before you say all this?  Because I know that certain things don't go together.  Did you try the bacon cupcake that was in here a few months back?  No, I didn't.  A little piece of bacon on top?  Nice.  I don't like meat with ice cream.  I'm telling you, I would dip the bacon in that ice cream sundae.  It's probably good, dude.  It's probably fucking good.  No, I'm telling you that it's good.  My brain can process this, and the tastes do not go together.  When can we get those? 
[00:54:00]  Today?  Let's try them today.  500 and something calories.  It's not as horrible as I would have thought.  I don't know how that's probably a thimble size.  But that's my point.  You know it's not good for you.  Right.  Going into it.  I can't imagine.  But the calorie count actually made me go, I might try it,  because it's 500 and something, I think,  which I would have thought it was way more than that.  That's a lot, but it's not.  It's probably really small, then, if it's only 500 calories.  You wouldn't try it?  Yeah, it's probably small.  You got to try it, at least, Dan.  You like bacon?  I love bacon, and I love ice cream. 
[00:54:30]  There you go.  But not together.  There you go.  No.  There you go.  No.  You just said it.  Well, I love spaghetti, and I love cereal,  but I'm not going to mix them together.  That's a little rough.  That would be fucking terrible.  That's a little rough.  That's true.  And this is the same fucking thing.  This falls into the same category.  Anthony wears the color black, and he also likes people.  There you go.  We got to try this. 
[00:55:00]  What's this not?  I think it's going to be really good.  I cannot imagine bacon and ice cream being good,  and chocolate-like sauce and caramel in there.  They are going to sell a shitload of these.  Of course, because there's fucking slobs out there.  But in the end, it tastes good.  No.  Because there's other shitty stuff you could get at Burger King,  but this in particular is going to do well.  What's in it, Sam?  It looks like vanilla, ice cream, hot fudge, caramel, and bacon. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, my God.  Just came.  Just came down his leg.  You think he's leaking clear stuff?  Oh, he's leaking.  B-Rock, are you a bacon guy?  Bacon, yes.  Fudge and I came out.  Does he feel like cannibalism?  Yeah, he doesn't really like sweets, believe it or not.  Wow.  What's your weakness?  He likes meats, not sweets.  Floorboards.  His arches.  Floorboards.  I'm sorry, I don't mean those things.  Yeah, you don't like a lot of dessert stuff, right? 
[00:56:00]  I don't like...  I'm not a sweet person.  What are you into?  Sandwiches.  Do you love sandwiches?  With a lot of mayo.  Tomorrow we'll have sandwiches.  Like, what's your weakness in sandwich-wise?  He loves sandwiches.  He does?  I don't know the way he says it.  The food I like when we're talking about.  Like, would you eat...  He likes Doritos and stuff like that.  He likes his snacks in bags.  Oh, my God.  Whoa, man.  Oh, my God.  That sounds awful. 
[00:56:30]  That's great.  Without the hamburger in it?  No, no, you make it, and then whatever's left over, you put it in the fridge,  and then you have it the next day when it's cold.  Cold shit that's supposed to be hot sucks.  There's only a very few things that you could eat out of the fridge  when it's supposed to be hot.  Now try it.  No, I will not.  You know what?  Cold food skeeves me out when it's supposed to be hot.  Like, I don't even like it getting on me or anything.  It's like, ah, ew.  You don't like cold food? 
[00:57:00]  No, not when it's supposed to be hot.  I like cold food that's supposed to be cold.  Like, what's a good cold food that's supposed to be hot?  Something like a hacky radio break, but I mean...  Everyone would say pizza.  I'll tell you.  I like cold pizza.  I don't like cold pizza.  I don't like it.  I'd rather it be hot.  Absolutely.  Pasta is good.  What?  Pasta.  You could act...  No.  No.  It's not bad cold pasta.  It's gotta be...  No, it's gotta be hot.  What's that?  Cold spaghetti in the sauce?  Not bad.  It's terrible.  Not bad.  Terrible.  It needs to be hot.  If you're lazy, you take it out of the refrigerator and go to town.  Hot.  It's horrid. 
[00:57:30]  Not bad.  Ice cream?  No.  Cold french fries?  I don't know about that.  Lunch came as I was napping, so I didn't feel like heating up my french fries.  I want cold french fries yesterday.  Really?  With the chicken sandwich that was cold.  You can get away with chicken.  Yeah, cold chicken.  Yeah.  Cold chicken you can get away with.  Cold french fries, I didn't mind.  With the turkey, you just pluck it off the fucking thing in the fridge.  That you can get away with.  Pasta, you can get away with it.  I'm telling you.  Sometimes beef, if it's London broil and it's sliced thin, you could eat it without heating 
[00:58:00]  it up.  That's okay.  But not a big fatty piece of fucking steak or anything.  But no, pasta is the worst thing.  I can't even smell cold fucking pasta with sauce.  It's gotta be in the microwave.  Heat that fucker up, and then it's wonderful.  I'd rather have it heated up, but I could eat it cold.  No problem.  You don't eat Chef Boyardee or SpaghettiOs right out of the can?  All right, that's rough.  Take two minutes.  What's wrong with you?  No.  It's gotta get in your body that quickly? 
[00:58:30]  It's delicious.  Oh, God.  You're like a goat.  Jesus.  Like a goat.  Deep salt can.  Wow.  My pal Sarah from Buffalo, she writes, there are people in western New York who dip Wendy's  fries in chocolate Frosties.  Yes, I've seen people do that.  Yeah, that's rolling.  I like that.  And chicken nuggets.  I like that.  Chicken nuggets.  Really?  Dip a chicken nugget in a frost.  It's the salty sweet thing.  So why can't you do this?  Yeah, the bacon is the salt, then you got the vanilla ice cream.  I'm telling you, this thing is gonna be a hit.  I bet it's gonna be great.  When's it coming out? 
[00:59:00]  Tomorrow.  All right, we're gonna get these tomorrow.  Let's not forget.  Hey, Iraq, what kind of sandwich is a weakness for you?  Like, is it a big sub roll, like a Kaiser roll, or?  It depends.  Like, you can do the Kaiser roll, or I like a nice Jewish rye bread.  What on?  I like rye bread, too.  Rye bread's the best.  You know, I've never liked rye bread.  Do they have seeds in them?  Carraway seeds?  I hate carraway seeds.  Yeah, or bring them here seeds.  Ah, get it? 
[00:59:30]  So what kind of sandwich do you love right now?  People that eat seven-grain bread and stuff, blow me.  It's like you're fucking chewing on gravel.  It's a coaster.  I don't need that.  I like nice, soft bread.  You don't like rye bread?  I'm so angry with bread.  I love rye bread.  I hate rye bread.  And I don't like pumpernickel.  I love it.  I hate pumpernickel.  You don't like the rye pumpernickel swirl?  No, it looks like cake, and then you get fooled when you bite it.  I hate that.  That's the worst bread ever.  Pumpernickel. 
[01:00:00]  Pumpernickel is horrible.  Do you like liverwurst?  Do you know what I'd like that right now?  Liverwurst.  Here's what I would eat right now.  Liverwurst, yes.  I would eat a liverwurst sandwich on rye with a piece of fucking Swiss and some mustard.  Spicy mustard, yep.  And a fucking onion.  No, not the onion.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Hang on.  You got a liverwurst hard on it.  Dude, he just rolls his seat back.  He rolls back in his seat and he shows a pup tent in his jeans just talking about liverwurst.  I hate liverwurst because growing up, that was our go-to lunch for a lot. 
[01:00:30]  It's the best.  Oh, it was horrible.  That yellow mustard on Pepperidge Farm bread.  There was way more liverwurst than bread.  Oh, yeah.  It stinks.  Oh, it was horrible.  We used to have bologna.  Fuck that.  Bologna is great.  When, you know, bologna is great.  Bologna is great.  No, it's not.  Bologna is great.  No, you can get the right poverty food.  It's the best.  Which I had to eat, too.  Bologna.  Which I know where salami is good.  I would have bologna.  I would hate those little things that would be in bologna.  You'd bite into them.  They had a spicy taste.  What were those little pieces of...  What?  Oh, those are like in salami.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  Those little fucking pepper things.  Yeah, I mean, bologna once in a while, too.  Yeah, you'd have to pick those out.  I was so jealous when I went to friends' houses, and they had individually sliced cheese.  We never had that.  Oh, no.  We had to cut our cheese off a big fucking hunk of cheese.  A block of cheese.  And you never cut it properly.  Individually wrapped?  It was always too thick.  Aw.  Well, I think we're going to add to this conversation with Club Soda Kenny.  Yes, Kenny.  Oh, boy.  You want me to add something funny?  Just whatever you want to do. 
[01:01:30]  This is the end of the conversation.  Yes.  I had a boss, and he liked to eat bologna sandwiches for lunch, but he would say,  get me a horse cock sandwich on rye.  I don't even...  What?  Because a bologna looks like a horse cock?  It looks like a horse cock.  Big and fat.  That's what he used to say.  Oh, this is a real thing.  Yeah.  I thought it was a Kenny original. 
[01:02:00]  Oh.  Oh, he used to actually say that.  Oh, a boss.  I would assume.  Ah, I would assume.  Was it dice?  No, no, no.  Oh.  It was when somebody used to be a policeman.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was...  Get me a horse cock sandwich.  No, no.  He used to eat kosher.  Kosher.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at that picture of dice.  People want to know where you're at with cold egg rolls.  No.  If your Chinese food is cold.  No. 
[01:02:30]  Chinese food definitely has to be fucking warm.  It congeals.  I completely agree with you on that one.  It congeals.  And this guy says the bacon sundae is phenomenal.  There's a restaurant in Detroit that already has it.  Brian.  Yeah.  I was totally against it until they had the chocolate covered bacon.  I had no idea what it was.  I'm hooked.  I bet it sells very well in Detroit.  We're going to try these things tomorrow.  Yeah.  Would you at least have an open mind?  Because I'm willing to bet that you would like it.  I think you're going to like this. 
[01:03:00]  I will have a taste of one.  I think you brought to me fresh and covered.  I don't want anybody...  You spitting this?  Did you ever have a cold, sweet, and sour chicken with the sauce not on it?  Oh, God.  It's amazing, right?  It's good.  Yeah, it's amazing.  You've got to try it.  Even the cold sauce is good.  Oh, you and your cold sauces.  They get fucking hard and congealed and fucking separate.  General Tao's chicken.  Tao?  Tao, chow, chow.  It's chow.  There's so many different ways.  Yes, it is. 
[01:03:30]  It's not Tao.  It's not General Tao.  I've never heard Tao.  It's Tao, I think.  Who do you like?  Do you like the drug Cesar, you dumbbell?  It's called General Tso's.  General Chow.  General...  I go General Chow, yeah.  It's not Tao.  I love General Chow's chicken.  I don't order it anymore because I don't like saying it because I don't know how it's said.  You think that's healthy, though?  Yeah.  No.  You think that chicken skin's healthy?  No.  But, dude, it's good.  Oh, is it good?  It's fucking good.  I'd love some nice General Chow's chicken with some brown rice and a fucking handjob. 
[01:04:00]  Some fucking Chinese general warrior.  They've named chicken after him after years and years.  He's probably due to people, he'd probably carve them up and...  Oh, no, he's probably run away.  He's a chicken.  He wasn't brave.  He's as fun as a chicken.  Let's go to break.  Let's go to break.  Yeah, we gotta eat.  We gotta talk about Sandusky.  Oh, boy, is he in trouble.  Oh, he's in a bit of trouble.  Oh, boy, is he in trouble.  I just wish others would be in trouble. 
[01:04:30]  We all know Sandusky's in trouble, but what the fuck?  McQuarrie's a piece of shit, though.  McQuarrie is, right?  Although, at least he did something.  I'll say that.  I think he didn't know what to do, but I think he did do something.  Yeah.  I don't hate McQuarrie.  I think down the line, they dropped the ball on that one.  I think he did something.  Not enough, perhaps.  But I think other people didn't do a lot more than he didn't do.  I think he didn't know what to do.  Yeah.  We got the latest on the Sandusky trial next.  And later this morning, Jimmy Fallon. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, that's a real celebrity.  Yeah, we like when Jimmy Fallon comes on through.  What is he promoting this time around?  He's got an album.  Nice.  With a bunch of his songs on it.  Like, a bunch of the guest things that he's done.  Like the Paul McCartney song.  Right.  The Bruce Springsteen song.  And he put his T-Bowey song on there.  Ooh.  So he did a whole album.  And he has a sequel book to his Thank You Notes book.  Damn it.  Yeah.  We should put out an album.  Some of the weird songs that have been made.  Drew Boogie already did it. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  No, but, you know, like, with the O&A label.  I'll sing on it.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's one.  Coming down in three-part, coming down.  Can we play a song from Fallon's album or no?  Do we have any assistance?  I know Roland has copies of it.  Well, how about we get a copy before we do it?  Just roll it!  Please roll it.  Please roll it.  Please.  All right.  I don't know how to go to break, so.  I don't know how you go to break on Satellite Radio.  It's the weirdest fucking thing.  Just hit something.  All right.  The O.P. and Anthony Show on Sirius XM. 
[01:06:00]  I said a hip hop.  A hip it to the hip it to the hip hip hop.  You don't stop.  Rock it to the bang bang.  Boogie sit up.  Jump the boogie.  Rock the rhythm of the boogie to me.  Now what you hit is not a test.  I'm rappin' to the beat.  And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your beat.  Now Peter Piper picked peppers. 
[01:06:30]  But Rob Rocks run.  A Humpty Dumpty fell down.  That's his hard time.  A Jack B. Nimble.  Hump, Nimble.  And he was quick.  A Jack B. Massacre cut faster.  Dax Audition.  Now here's a little story I got to tell.  About three bad brothers you know so well.  It started way back in history.  With that ride.  MCA and me, Mike D.  On a war tour.  With my arm and my man.  Go in each and every place with a mic.  And Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump.  Oh, do me, baby.  I'll do the Humpty hump. 
[01:07:00]  Watch me do the Humpty hump.  One, two, three, and so the boat.  Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door.  It's the capital S2, yes, the president.  Double P-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-S-E.  Wow.  California.  It was all a dream.  I used to read Word Up magazine.  Something happened, heavy deal from the limousine.  Hanging pictures of a wall.  Every Saturday, rap attack, Mr. Magic Marley Ball.  Push my seat in her push for life. 
[01:07:30]  It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right.  If Mary dropped my baby girl,  tonight I would name her walking high.  My name is...  What?  My name is...  Who?  My name is...  You're picking Slim Shady.  Is it worth it?  Let me work it.  I'll put my thing down, flip it, and reverse it.  It's your flippin' nippin' nippin' nippin'.  It's your flippin' nippin' nippin'.  Soulja Boy off the door.  Watch me crank, watch me roll.  Watch me crank that Soulja Boy, that Superman. 
[01:08:00]  Now watch me you crank that Soulja Boy.  Crank that Soulja Boy.  Crank that Soulja Boy.  Crank that Soulja Boy.  My eye, my eye, my eye, my eye.  You gotta live your life.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  You steady chasing my pain, fuck up.  I said a hip hop, the hip it to the hip it to the hip hip hop.  You don't stop.  You don't stop. 
[01:08:30]  Is that us, I guess?  We're all leading.  Thanks, E-Rock.  What was that off Fallon's album?  Yeah, that's the history of rap with Justin Timberlake.  Blow Your Pants Off is the name of the CDs promoting today.  Was that him singing all those?  Him and Justin Timberlake.  And the roots in the back.  Some pretty good impressions in there, right?  The roots.  Yeah, it was pretty good, actually.  You know, they were on the show doing impressions of people.  It sounded like the real people. 
[01:09:00]  That was pretty good.  Did you guys see the pictures of the Miami face-eating victim?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  I think he has an egg over his eye.  Oh, my God.  God, yes.  You see all those crescent bite marks on his head?  But to know that was done by someone eating your face.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  And then they also have...  He also has bullet wounds in his chest? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, apparently when they were offing the guy that was eating him,  eh, might have...  He took a couple bullets?  Might have taken a couple rounds himself.  So not only did he have his face eaten off,  his eyes are completely gone.  Yep.  Both eyes gone?  Uh, it looks...  They don't know.  One has been chewed out.  Oh, my God.  It was gouged out.  One is still there.  They don't know if he'll be able to use it.  He may be able to use his one eye.  Let's hope he has some vision left.  That'll be good.  So you can see what he looks like.  Oh, yeah, right? 
[01:10:00]  You want to kind of hope you don't have your vision.  At that point?  Yeah.  Nah.  You want your eyes always.  His fucking nose is gone!  You want your eyes.  Just gone.  He bit his nose off.  He bit his nose off.  Pretty disturbing.  But he's, uh...  That's fucked up.  He's finally awake and he's walking around.  Good for him.  Good for him.  Good for him.  Oh, that's fucking...  That's too much.  That is too fucking much.  They're always worried that when they say, 
[01:10:30]  What do you want to eat?  He's going to go,  I'll have a side of nose.  Oh, no.  I don't even know what that means.  I don't know.  I'll have a side of nose, please,  with a little beard whisker  thrown in there for good measure.  Beard whisker.  Yeah, he's a big bearded face guy.  That'd be the worst.  Like a hair in your teeth.  Yeah.  Biting his head.  All right.  Oh, uh, Henry Hill died, huh?  Yeah, huh?  Oh, look.  He Rock's just been waiting. 
[01:11:00]  He Rock was waiting.  We didn't set that up ahead of time.  He Rock was just waiting.  He really was waiting for that.  He had his hoof over the button.  He was only 69.  Well, he kind of had a hard life, didn't he?  I think so.  Yeah.  That's what he looked like?  Yeah.  He had a restaurant called Wise Guys.  I guess you'd wink after you said that.  Ah, I see.  Ah, I see.  Yeah, Wise Guys.  You know the guys are happy he's dead?  You think all the menu items 
[01:11:30]  had something to do with the mafia?  The names?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Give me the whacked burger.  It's all mob-related stuff.  Yeah.  Hey, let me get the Godfather's squingeal.  All right, guys.  We get it.  You were in the mob.  Yeah, you were in the mob.  We're trying to make good now.  We get it.  Yeah.  You don't like those theme restaurants when they do that? 
[01:12:00]  They're horrible.  Henry Hill's new mob-themed restaurant burns.  It burnt to the ground?  Really?  That's what happened to it?  Ah.  What year was that?  You'll light a match.  2007.  That seems like that's some old beef.  Eh, either that or he needed the insurance money.  He needed the money!  I'm trying to bang this broad, Henry!  Yeah, sitting outside the place in a car.  Would you rather eat a face cold or hot?  Very good question.  We were just doing this bit.  If you had to eat a face, would you have to heat it up or go cold? 
[01:12:30]  Oh, you gotta eat a face cold.  Cold?  Right off the fucking bone.  Oh, it's delicious.  No, hot!  Like my mother used to...  My mother used to cook the face.  It would fall apart.  My mouth?  My mouth would fricassee her head.  The cheeks, they would tumble right off.  You'd just kiss them and they'd fall off on your mouth.  Oh, they'd fall off.  You'd pull it out of the sauce.  It wasn't even on the skull no more.  You'd have to pull it out of the sauce.  Oh, mmm. 
[01:13:00]  Delicious.  And the chin, the tender chin.  Oh, I'd be like, I want the chin.  Mama Mia.  Yeah.  Mama would make a face.  Take that Beatles song.  I just ate a face.  Get it?  Instead of I've just seen a face.  Eating the face that keeps in a jar by the door.  That's funny, little Eleanor Rigby.  Yes.  Hey, you're funny. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he's dead, huh?  Yeah, 69.  What are you dying of?  All those years.  Undisclosed illness.  Yeah, no, undisclosed illness, but his wife said he was sick for some time now.  Some kind of cancer then, I guess, huh?  Maybe I don't want to.  Yeah, I heard on the radio she was saying like it was cigarette related.  Oh, he did smoke a lot of cigarettes.  Maybe he had emphysema.  He did smoke a lot of cigarettes.  But wow, you know something?  Everyone thought the mob was going to get him for years, you know? 
[01:14:00]  Mm-hmm.  I mean, he did rat on him.  Mm-hmm.  But why didn't they kill him or Sammy the Bull?  I mean, I know those guys are pretty high profile guys.  But they're not that high profile where you couldn't just have somebody shoot them in the car.  I'm not saying I want that to happen, but you'd think the mob would do that to send the message, but they didn't.  Sammy's a scary fucking dude, though.  Sammy the Bull's scary, but you know what?  He's just a guy.  Yeah.  Oh, Henry Hill died like the day after his birthday.  Oh, that sucks.  Oh, boy.  Blowing out his candle, his fucking lungs fell out. 
[01:14:30]  Fell out.  I needed those lungs, Karen.  Yeah.  Yes.  They had emphysema in them, Henry.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know why.  I guess the mob just kind of lost its oomph.  They lost a lot of that with the RICO statutes.  I'm telling you, the RICO statutes hurt the mafia.  Scared the shit out of anybody that, you know, you could send out your enforcer to kill somebody, 
[01:15:00]  but you're going down, too, if you're even in the same group as him.  And also, like, guys will do five or six or even eight years for you or whatever,  but you're not going to get guys willing to do 25 years for you.  No.  It's just too much time.  Yep.  So they started turning.  And that fucking wreck, they didn't kill him, though.  No.  He got to live out his life.  Where was he living?  Oh, he was out of witness protection, wasn't he?  Yeah, because he committed crimes. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Uh, near Malibu.  Oh.  Oh, nice.  So he wasn't even, you know, leaving the country.  No kidding.  Is that California, Iraq?  Iraq, Malibu, Florida?  Probably Malibu, Florida.  I bet it is Malibu, Florida.  And is it California?  Was it California?  Oh.  How come it's not Malayay?  Double guns?  DG, baby.  Yes.  We got a guy getting his wisdom teeth out.  Another one of these videos. 
[01:16:00]  You want to hear it?  Yeah.  You do?  Yes.  What is he, under anesthesia?  Oh, maybe.  Do we have the video this came from?  Or should I play it from over here?  I'm over here now.  I'll wait for Danny to send it to me.  Oh.  Turn that off.  Let's say hi to Anthony in Staten Island.  Hi.  I'm in Staten Island, guys.  What's up, man?  How are you?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Oh, who's this?  All right.  The reason why they can't kill Sandy the Bull is because he's in the South River confinement 
[01:16:30]  in Texas.  And he's died of thyroid cancer.  So what's the sense of why you've been going after him?  Oh, is he?  You've got to send a message.  Yeah.  He's been dying of the same thyroid cancer for 20 years.  He has thyroid cancer.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  You know what?  He's not even worth even a bullet anymore.  No, I don't mean that.  But I mean before when he was out in Arizona.  Obviously, now I get it.  But before.  Yeah.  Oh, Arizona.  They went out and looked for him and tried to kill him.  But the cops in Arizona came out there to protect him. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, okay.  How come they didn't get him?  Oh, so why didn't they get him in jail?  This is great.  Sorry.  We're looking at some of them.  Yeah.  He was too protected in jail?  Yeah, he was in solitary confinement in jail.  Oh, yeah.  No one could get you in there, right?  No, come on.  It's the mafia.  They're supposed to be able to.  Well, you should, but the mafia isn't like it used to be anymore.  Yeah, I'm surprised.  Because he was selling ecstasy in Arizona. 
[01:17:30]  He wasn't as low.  It wasn't like he just went into kind of civilian hiding.  He started dealing in the business again.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he came out of witness protection.  He's like, hey, if they're going to come after me, come after me.  I don't know, but Jim, he wrote the book.  His life, he told everybody, whoever wants to kill me, come and get me.  Right.  How do you know so much about this, Anthony from Staten Island?  Well, my father grew up in the...  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Just say that.  I heard it in your voice.  No kidding.  I definitely could hear it in his voice.  I'm on my best behavior right now.  Yeah.  He's a scary guy, though.  I grew up around this life.  Paisan.  Sammy the Bull's a frightening dude, man.  He was a guy that I think even other guys in that business, you had to be very cautious  with him.  No, the only one who was very frightening was John Goddard.  Really?  He was scarier than Sammy the Bull?  Oh, hell yeah.  John will kill you in a minute.  Oh, okay.  John was a good guy, though, with his neighborhood and everything.  Well, yeah.  Well, don't get me wrong. 
[01:18:30]  I mean, these guys back in the 80s were all gentlemen and everything else.  Gentlemen, yeah.  And they were all cowboys, and they don't respect anything.  No, there's no more code.  No.  Code is gone.  It's gone.  And that's pretty much what the whole thing was based around, you know?  You can't have that organization without the respect and the code and, you know, when  you've just got these fucking jadrules walking around. 
[01:19:00]  Well, yeah, of course.  Yeah.  They all think they're a bunch of tough guys.  They're a bunch of tough guys, right?  No respect.  No respect.  No respect.  I hear you.  What did you have last night?  Some scungil?  I had some little scungil, galamad, and a little greenie.  I love my Italian brethren.  Yeah.  All right there, Anthony.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks for the call, man.  Thanks.  I love this show.  Jim, you're great.  Hope, you're great.  Anthony, you're great.  Thanks, buddy.  Thank you, Anthony.  Oh, great.  See you, buddy. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  Thank God he likes us.  So this is the video of Sam?  Yes.  All right.  What do we got here?  Chatty without wisdom teeth is awesome.  You can watch along on break.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And we'll put it on our Facebook page.  We have to work.  Everything goes on our Facebook page that's kind of visual on this show.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook, one word.  Let's do this.  Let me see this guy.  Oh, boy.  Czechoslovakia in Russia.  Oh, they tie.  How do you say Czechoslovakia? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, good job.  I mean, what's it?  Russia?  Russia.  They're bad people, huh?  No, they're not bad people.  Do they wear the big hats?  Sometimes.  Like, remember that guy we saw at the toy store?  That black guy?  Yeah, big hat.  I got a picture, but I felt so cool.  Did you?  Yeah.  Do you want something to eat, Czechoslovakia?  Yes, please.  Would you like us some ice cream?  What's this guy on?  Well, I was thinking we could get some Panda Express. 
[01:20:30]  I don't think so.  We go to the pancakes house.  But you're the mom, so you know it's best.  Okay, I'll go get you a bowl of ice cream.  Okay, thanks.  Okay, you just let me.  If you're tired, you go to sleep, okay?  Okay, but I'm not tired, so I don't want to go to sleep.  How are you doing today?  Good, how are you?  How are you doing today?  Good.  I'm going to have a fire tonight.  What?  You can walk to?  Well, I don't want to make it because I think I'm kind of stoned. 
[01:21:00]  And so I could probably let it out.  Oh, my dad went so hard to build it for us.  Oh my God, he's crying now.  I killed someone last week.  Get out!  He just confesses to murders and rapes.  You scared me.  You got to like, you got to like say something before you touch me.  Like say like, Chad, I'm going to touch your arm.  Okay.  Okay.  My, look at my tongue.  Hey, I want you to talk to Chad.  Is it not?  This guy is fucked up.  Say hi to your dad.  Hey, dad. 
[01:21:30]  I love you.  He's on the phone.  I don't know how I'm doing.  I'm just crying and watching soccer.  Mom will give me Panda.  Are you a frantic?  Ice cream, which is really good.  Stop crying.  Are you going to come home soon to see me?  Okay, good.  The lady that was really nice to me.  Yeah, she gave me an IV and put some of these things in my nose.  Oh, I hear pussy too.  Yeah.  Next thing I knew, I woke up. 
[01:22:00]  I guess I'm done.  I don't know if I have to go back yet though.  Really?  You really think I'm done?  Drugs rule.  Okay, good.  Well, you're really smart and I trust you and I trust him all.  Oh, this kid's embarrassing.  I'm going to believe you.  The ball just went out of bounds and the keyboard grabbed it.  What do you do then?  Oh, corner kick.  Just kidding.  Children on the TV.  So like that. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Russia and Zivaki are playing.  Is that how you say it?  Oh, boy.  A hamburger?  No, but I'm going to be pissed at you.  Because she says I can't eat that stuff.  She says I have to have soup and an Arizona.  Yeah, smoothie king.  But if you want, you can give me a smoothie king. 
[01:23:00]  But don't spend lots of money because we need to save our money for like a Great Depression.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  Why are you laughing at me?  How long is this fucking video?  Really?  Oh, my God.  How long is this fucking half over?  Was I real funny?  Not for this.  Not for this fruit.  Yeah, we should have.  They should have added to this a little bit.  Yeah.  I wish I could be funny one day.  All right.  What now would it be really funny?  And guess what?  He's hamming it up.  I'm going to make like a million dollars.  I think at the beginning he was. 
[01:23:30]  You think he's hamming it up?  I don't know.  I think at the beginning he was a little more fucked up.  Like, I think it's just starting to wear off.  Yeah.  I like it.  He's fucked up, but he has a weird voice on top of it, too.  Yeah.  They should have added it.  Kind of like Bobcat a little bit.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get our dicks hard.  Oh.  Sandusky time.  Yeah.  Now we're talking.  This is the day we battle with the soap.  Soap battles. 
[01:24:00]  Pertussis pit stop?  What happened?  Oh, I don't know.  Jeff Gordon teams up to raise awareness on Pertussis.  Why?  I hate when athletes get involved with.  Don't team up.  Yeah, exactly.  Do we need a race car driver to talk about Pertussis?  Yes.  Are you coughing?  Sometimes nothing will slow up my racing game like coughing.  Fucking asshole.  You're worried about your racing game.  How about you fight wolves?  If my carburetor starts coughing, I might lose a race.  If you start coughing, you could lose your life. 
[01:24:30]  Hi, I'm a dick fuck that drives around in circles.  Some of my best friends have been burned to death and fire's gone fast.  Do you have the sniffles?  I lost a friend to a four-car pileup.  Pertussis is very bad.  You'll know you have it because you'll be coughing for three and a half months straight.  You drive in a circle quickly.  Those things aren't connected.  I don't know why I'm here.  Why am I here? 
[01:25:00]  I coughed one time.  When you hit the wall at 200 miles an hour, you might cough up some glass.  If you have Pertussis, you're coughing up mucus.  Mucus on the track will make you skid.  Old Dale Earnhardt hit some mucus and slipped right into the wall.  And he coughed himself out of the window.  Yeah, let's get to the hotness.  McQuarrie takes Stan in Sandusky sex abuse trial.  Yeah, he bet he does.  Fucking A. 
[01:25:30]  McQuarrie.  Do you want to read this, Jimmy?  Former Penn State assistant coach.  He lowers his voice.  Mike McQuarrie told jurors in Jerry Sandusky's sex abuse trial Tuesday  that he saw his ex-colleague with a prepubescent boy in an on-campus shower  and that he heard skin on skin smacking sound.  He heard that fucking... 
[01:26:00]  It's like that fucking the ball slapping sound.  The fucking...  The thighs slapping.  The unmistakable sound of...  Thigh on ass.  A penis going into an asshole.  Yes.  The sound of one dick clapping.  Jesus.  McQuarrie told the jury...  Uh-oh, no.  He was at home in bed watching the film Rudy.  When he decided to go to the football team building, 
[01:26:30]  he said he walked into the support staff locker room  to put away a pair of new sneakers  and as he opened the door, he heard the noise.  Not to digress, but Rudy was a marvelous film.  No way.  When they carry him with his victory,  he ran the ball.  Oh, you getting all teary-eyed?  Yeah, he yelled, Rudy!  Rudy!  Very much skin-on-skin smacking sound, he said. 
[01:27:00]  I immediately become alert  and was kind of embarrassed  that I was walking in on something.  Embarrassed.  Embarrassed!  Yeah.  Don't embarrass me!  All right.  That's what...  How awful is that?  He's fucking...  He knows that he's hearing somebody get fucked in the ass.  He's probably thinking there's two players.  Oh, man.  You know, you don't think.  Right. 
[01:27:30]  So he said,  I felt like I was walking in on something.  He said he turned and glanced over his right shoulder  at a mirror that had a 45-degree angle  and saw Sandusky standing behind a boy  propped up against a wall.  Oh, my God.  He estimated the boy to be 10 to 12 years old.  He said the boy's hands were on the wall.  The glance would have taken only one or two seconds.  I immediately turned back to my locker  to make sure I saw what I saw.  McQuarrie said he looked directly into the shower  and saw Sandusky standing right up against the back 
[01:28:00]  of a young boy  with his arms around his midsection,  the closest proximity that I think you can be in.  Jesus.  Apparently, when your dick is in someone's ass,  you can't really get much closer.  When I asked what he saw,  McQuarrie said the defendant's midsection  was moving subtly.  McQuarrie said that he tried to think  and then put his shoes in his locker  and slammed it shut hard.  Now, I understand you don't know how to react,  but there's a child being fucked in the ass  and you still take your shoes off. 
[01:28:30]  Hey, he slammed the locker door.  You know.  I made the loud noise in an attempt to say,  someone's here.  Break it up.  Break it up.  Jesus.  A child rape.  This whole fucking school  is just filled with pieces of shit  who care more about the sports program  and their own futures than a child.  And I know he did something,  and maybe you can't run in there,  but how do you not walk over and go,  excuse me?  In that situation,  you're like,  what the fuck are you doing? 
[01:29:00]  How do you not make that kid feel safe?  By the way,  I'm calling the fucking police.  Or just put a towel around the kid.  10 to 12 years old.  What the fuck?  He said,  oh, he goes,  McQueary said,  adding that he stepped closer  to the opening of the shower room  and saw they were separated  and facing him directly.  We looked directly into each other's eyes.  Oh, sexy.  At that time,  I left the locker room  and went upstairs.  Oh, good.  Oh, he said it was more than his brain could handle.  I was making decisions on the fly. 
[01:29:30]  I picked up the phone  and called my father  to get advice from a person  I trusted most of my life  because I just saw something ridiculous.  So I understand it's shocking,  but I guess when you're a grown man,  and you see an adult  fucking a 10-year-old in the ass,  you don't know what you should do.  Yeah.  You're put in a position  where you have no choice.  You got to do something.  Yeah, he's thinking about his career  and all this other shit,  but guess what?  You were put in a position  and there's no choice here.  Oh, he said he was very vague  with his father on the phone  and that his dad, John, 
[01:30:00]  told him to leave immediately  and come to the house.  Not call the cops,  not see if the kid's all right.  Yeah.  McQuarrie said he went to Coach Paterno's house  the next morning  and relayed what he had seen,  but did not describe the act  explicitly out of respect for the coach  and his own embarrassment.  I don't know.  I guess most overrated guy in history,  Joe Paterno,  his fucking feelings were too fragile.  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  Fuck these,  all these people.  Fuck all these guys.  It was a giant cover-up.  They were just trying to protect  everyone else's jobs, 
[01:30:30]  the school's reputation,  the coach,  the legacy.  God, what shitty fucking people.  At the expense of a fucking child rape.  10 to 12-year-old.  What shitheads?  Yeah.  By some old creep.  Oh, my God.  But it sounds like he gave Paterno  enough info, though.  Absolutely.  And Paterno still did what?  What did he do?  Because now we're going to have to deal  with all these assholes  that bleed Penn State football.  Even Penn State fans,  the more details that are coming out,  you don't hear them piping up anymore. 
[01:31:00]  Not as much, right?  How can they?  With this testimony?  Fucking horrendous.  And he might not have been fucking the kid.  He might have literally  been pressed up against him  and had his dick.  I've done it to girls before.  You put your dick under their ass,  between their legs,  where you mock fucking them  from the back,  but you're not.  Oh, sure.  It might not have been an actual.  Because he's saying that his hips  were moving subtly.  That's not okay either.  Oh, no.  Of course not.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's just as bad,  I'm thinking.  What the fuck?  What happened to the kid  after all this? 
[01:31:30]  Don't know.  Where was his parents?  What did they know?  Are we going to find out?  I don't know.  I don't know which numbered  victim that one was.  Well, there's also the bedtime routine.  Bedtime routine.  I didn't see this yet, Jim.  Love a good bedtime routine.  The second, should we go,  there's some,  fuck yeah.  This is the second Sandusky accuser  details bedtime routine.  The second day of Jerry Sandusky's  criminal trial began with  tearful testimony  from a young man who said  he was sexually abused.  Blah, blah, blah. 
[01:32:00]  Joseph McGettigan,  senior deputy,  okay, question witnesses for an hour,  okay.  The young man who has been referred to  as Victim One  was a freshman at Clinton County  when his mother filed,  this is a high school,  his mother filed the complaint  against Sandusky in 2008.  This is what led to the  Attorney General's investigation.  Tuesday morning,  the witness said  he met Sandusky  through the Second Mile Charity,  which was just a fucking,  a boy ass and dick  assembly line for this guy.  Yeah, this was a smorgasbord 
[01:32:30]  for this guy.  Yeah, it was a young  cock and balls buffet  founded by him.  And he said he was  invited to football games  and eventually slept over  more than a hundred times  in the basement  of the Sandusky home.  At first it was  he would kiss me  on the forehead goodnight.  And when it came to him  kissing me on the,  and then it came to him  kissing me on the cheek  and rubbing my back  and pulling me  on top of him  and cracking my back,  the young man said.  You gotta crack your back.  What a move.  He's got good moves. 
[01:33:00]  I thought he sees me  as family  and this is what  family does.  Oh, wow.  So he didn't,  you know,  you're that age,  you don't want to react.  This is what family does?  The young man said  the bedtime routine  continued after he made  attempts to hide  under a pool table  in the basement.  He said Sandusky's wife,  Dottie!  Dottie,  that enabling  fucking blind woman.  Never came into the,  yeah,  Dottie's a horrible cunt.  Dottie knew everything  that was going on.  Stop it.  Or suspected.  Yeah.  She never came 
[01:33:30]  into the basement.  He paused as McGettigan  asked him how  activity developed  over time.  Backcracking,  rolling around in bed,  back massages.  Can I stop you  for a second?  Sure.  Why did this kid  sleep over there  a hundred times?  This is the quandary  of abused kids  that do things  and it's like,  well,  why didn't you just leave?  It's like,  but he's hiding  under pool tables  and stuff.  Yeah,  there's some weirdness  going on there.  You had good friends 
[01:34:00]  growing up.  You never slept  over a hundred times.  A sleepover was cool,  but a hundred times  is a lot of nights.  He's a football fan  and this guy was  a high-profile  football coach.  It's an authority figure  kind of thing  and it's weird.  It makes you cool  around your friends.  You get to meet the players.  You get the swag  and it developed.  Over time,  it's almost like  different things  become normal.  He probably was weirded out  by the kiss on the head,  but he's like,  yeah,  I don't want to be  uncomfortable  because a kiss on the head 
[01:34:30]  and then the back roll.  I believe when he says  this is what family does  and then it moves  into an area  that's uncomfortable,  but you're probably  already into 20 sleepovers  by then.  Right.  Fred from Brooklyn's guy.  He goes,  Dottie,  like the kid's  blood-splattered underwear.  Clever.  Back cracking,  rolling around in bed,  back massages.  He put his hand  down my shorts.  The same thing  except that this time  he sat there  and he looked at me  and said something  along the lines of, 
[01:35:00]  it's your turn.  Uh-oh.  You never want it  to be your turn.  He made me put my mouth  on his privates.  Whoa.  In the end,  the witness said  the two had oral sex  more than 25 times.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  He's now 18  and he's recounted  an early encounter  that escalated  to oral sex.  I spaced,  he said.  I didn't know  what to do  with all the thoughts  running through my head.  I just kind of blacked out  and didn't want it to happen.  I froze.  Oh, man.  And this is Sandusky.  This is the kid.  As he choked back tears, 
[01:35:30]  the sobbing teen  recounted another time  Sandusky performed here  to perform,  forced him to perform  oral sex  after saying  it was his turn.  I don't know  how to explain it.  I froze  like any other time,  he said.  My mind is telling me  to move,  but I couldn't do it.  I couldn't move.  The witness said  he stayed quiet  about the abuse  in part because  his mother thought  Sandusky was a positive influence.  Oh, God.  But he began to distance  himself from Sandusky.  At one point,  Sandusky became angry  with him because  they'd drifted apart  and the teen  became involved 
[01:36:00]  with his local  Big Brothers Big Sisters  organization.  Eventually,  the teen asked his mother  if there was a website  used to track  sex offenders  because he wanted to see  if Sandusky was on it.  That ultimately led  to a meeting  with the guidance counselor  where he reported  being abused.  Wow.  And of course,  the guidance counselor  first said,  well, make sure  he didn't believe  that.  Oh, really?  That whole fucking  college football culture  and that's shitty  and I'm sorry  to those of you  that don't,  but even the guidance  counselor was like,  well, he's got a heart  of gold  or one of the guidance  counselors said that.  They didn't want  to turn him in.  Make sure.  This is exhausting, 
[01:36:30]  but we got somebody  that believes football.  Of course.  Of course.  Go ahead, Mark.  Hey, Mark.  Let's hear your logic  today, sir.  This has nothing  to do with football.  This has everything  to do with money  and state college.  Oh, maybe.  Okay.  Might be right.  Well, the football,  like you said,  the second mile,  the second mile program  generates between that  and the university.  They probably said  over $100 million  since the first  allegation came out  in 98-2001.  Oh, maybe.  Fair enough, but. 
[01:37:00]  I still think  there's a culture  of some kind of weirdness  in football programs.  And you can't look  the other way.  You just can't.  I'm not saying  you can look the other way,  but they dragged  in Penn State football.  He retired or left  in 99.  I mean, he wasn't  under even the control of.  Yeah, and they still  let him fucking  come to the school  to the fuck.  He still had total access  to the locker rooms  and the facilities.  Yeah, he was still on campus  and, yeah,  like Jimmy said,  total access.  Hey, the guy's  a fucking monster.  Just like the guy  in Texas  that just beat  that guy to death 
[01:37:30]  that was abusing  his four-year-old.  McQuarrie,  6'5",  250 pounds.  I mean, come on.  Yeah, McQuarrie,  you're right.  McQuarrie should have  done something.  He should have stepped in.  He didn't want to  fuck up his position  with Penn State.  It's obvious to everybody.  And Paterno,  same thing.  Paterno put the football program  before the well-being  and did the minimum  amount required  and then just forgot about it.  But people say  that's good enough.  What else is he supposed to do?  Well, they say  by the law, though,  but I mean,  I know there's moral  and there's law  or obligations  and so forth,  but they can't hang 
[01:38:00]  the hat on Paterno.  They went above him  and went to Spaniard,  Schultz,  and Curry.  All of them, absolutely.  Dude, all of them.  But it came down to money  because they're all  connected with sex as well.  All of them are shit.  Paterno is shit.  Sandusky was shit,  obviously the biggest shit.  This McQuarrie is shit.  Curly is shit.  They're all shit.  Paterno wasn't shit, Jim.  You're shit.  That's right.  He was the false man.  He was shit.  In the end, man,  he was shit.  In the end,  he thought of the  fucking football program  before a kid being 
[01:38:30]  fucked in the ass.  He was shit.  It kind of erases  all the good you've done.  Well, like I said,  hey, I'm not a Penn State fan.  I live 40 miles.  Then why would you say  Paterno's not shit  when you know  that he was putting  the football program  and his own legacy  and the legacy of the program  ahead of that stuff?  Come on, dude.  This isn't an allegation  of a guy's out  with a cheerleader  and she says no  and he puts it in anyway,  but they were kind of dating.  Like, this isn't one 
[01:39:00]  of those dicey situations.  I mean,  where you could look at  and go,  all right,  maybe this is a fucking,  a guy,  a coach saying,  I saw another coach  fucking a 10-year-old  against the wall.  Yeah, but he keeps  saying it over again.  He didn't even say that.  Now, try to explain  to your grandfather  about it the same way.  I'm not making excuses  for Paterno.  Try to explain  to your grandfather?  Are you crazy?  He told him enough  where Paterno knew  what was going on.  I'd say,  hey, granddad,  you know that thing  you do to me?  Dude, here's how  you explain it to your, 
[01:39:30]  I know Joe Paterno  is a grandfatherly guy  and he doesn't know  any better.  Here's what you say  to him.  Hey, Joe, listen,  Coach Sandusky  was having sex  with a 10-year-old boy  in the shower.  He was sodomizing him.  I think I'll get that.  And you put,  hold on,  I'm explaining to you  how you tell your old man.  And you put aside  your uncomfortability  or what the 83-year-old  man might think  because you're thinking  more of the 10-year-old  who had the dick  in his ass.  I'm not arguing  that he should have 
[01:40:00]  pulled up.  I think he should have  went to the concert.  He had an ass  in his cock  in the shower.  Come on, Kirk.  But it's this thinking.  I'm amazed that there's  a lot of people out there  that don't see it this way.  But, dude,  I'm just listening  to what you're saying.  How do you explain  to your grandfather  enough with this  fucking grandfather shit?  Your grandfather's  seen some shit.  Well, first of all,  I only went to my grandfather  if I got some kid,  I fucking some kid in the ass.  That's my first,  that's the first problem.  Well, you're saying  grandfather because  Paterno was old.  How do you tell him?  You tell him.  Hey, look,  there's a 10-year-old  who's being raped 
[01:40:30]  in the shower.  Pop, pop.  Right.  Pop, pop.  Joe Pa.  Hey, I didn't meet  Sandusky when I was  10 years old,  like I said.  He didn't try to touch me.  How do you know?  Maybe you're blocking it out.  Exactly.  Were you ugly?  Ugly kid.  Stretched out asshole.  I have a self-conscious issue  that maybe I was  too fat and ugly for.  Yeah, you probably were.  Yeah, all right, man.  Thank you.  All right, buddy.  Thank you for your call.  All right.  Needed a boy.  He could put his arms  around in the shower,  apparently.  Yeah.  A big fat pig.  He didn't show me  how to rub my soap. 
[01:41:00]  What's that?  He didn't show me  how to use the soap properly.  I guess that was the problem.  Yeah, a little soap battle.  I know.  All right, buddy.  Thanks, bud.  All right.  Joe Pa.  Oh, wow.  This is not...  This shit happens.  Let's go to Ray in Westchester.  Ray.  No!  Hey, good morning.  Oh, that's a nice little surprise now.  Hey, man name.  You know who I am.  All right.  Who?  I used to be an aide  in an elementary school.  Aides. 
[01:41:30]  And we had a teacher  who was so mean.  How mean was he?  He was so mean  that he would want  tootsie with your tootsie.  What?  Take the sloths  and cut off.  Get out of your car.  Cut off your sloths  and get back in your car.  Yes.  Come to the fork in the road.  Jesus, how do you remember that?  Love that.  Yeah.  Great bit.  Go ahead, Ray.  We don't remember you.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  You're not memorable.  She used to embarrass  and humiliate 
[01:42:00]  and make the kids cry.  And one of the kids  in the class...  Who was she?  Georgie Porgie  Pudding and Pie?  Double guns, lady.  Who don't remember?  I hate that.  Double guns.  Oh.  And one of the kids  in the class  was a fellow aide's son.  So I told her  and I got reprimanded  by the principal.  I got called out  and they said  what goes on  in the classroom  stays in the classroom.  And one of the kids  What did she say?  Who gives a shit  about this? 
[01:42:30]  That's an awful call.  Who gives a shit  about this?  Oh, is that perfect?  Sorry.  I don't even know  what she saw.  No one does.  What was she saying?  Just because he was mean?  I know.  He was the meanest man  in town.  And then I said  and I had no idea  what she was talking about.  We went from  boys getting fucked  to a mean teacher.  Who cares?  We all had mean teachers.  That's a little different. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, right.  How mean was it?  Yeah, exactly.  The man spilled the glue  and I yelled at him  and we said  really?  Fucking here.  How many Z's  can you count?  Rich in Florida  makes a good point.  25 blowjobs?  That's 25 times  before he got uncomfortable.  Nah, he was uncomfortable  all along.  Probably the first time.  He finally just had  the balls to tell.  I bet he didn't even  give him a blowjob.  I bet Sandusky  fucked his mouth, you know?  He just kind of  sat there.  Well, the perfect world.  That's the latest 
[01:43:30]  on Sandusky.  Wow.  I hope Sandusky  hangs himself.  That'd be good.  He's not gonna.  Or gets killed  in jail.  I hope he's in jail  and he's killed.  Nothing like that  ever happens.  Nah, they'll protect him.  No, you always hear  what these guys...  I mean, I guess a lot  of them have been  in protective custody,  but...  It happened...  Yeah, like Jeffrey Dahmer,  he wound up getting  fucked up,  but that wasn't even  because of what he did.  No.  It's just a prison beef.  What was it,  a mop handle or something?  Yeah, beat him to death.  Beat him to death. 
[01:44:00]  Jeez.  Fucking caved his face in.  Jeez.  I mean, none of these  other guys, though,  really ever...  You don't hear about  them getting offed  in prison.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  There was one guy,  though, we were there,  went to San Quentin,  we saw some photos of him,  and I think I told you,  he had been in such  a bad, drunk driver,  he had multiple convictions,  and he killed a nine-year-old,  and her father's leg  got cut off.  Oh, boy.  So some convict  who was doing life  just in the middle  of the yard  fucking stabbed him  in the neck.  Wow.  And he bled out. 
[01:44:30]  Whoa.  Because he killed a kid,  and he died, yeah.  What happened to that convict?  He didn't give a fuck.  He gets another life sentence.  He was already there.  No, I understand that,  but do they put him  in the hole or something  for a really long time?  Yeah, maybe.  Like, how do they punish  someone that already  has a life sentence?  Maybe, yeah.  When you're that tough,  and you have that much time,  and you're never getting out,  and you're a pretty tough dude,  and you live in that world,  it's got to be freeing  in a way to see a guy  you don't like  and just kill him.  Right.  Like, you know you can do that.  No consequences.  You get to the point  of no return  where nothing else 
[01:45:00]  could happen to you.  Yeah.  That must be kind of freeing.  Oh, man.  If you think about it.  You're free in prison.  Amazing.  Well, you know what I mean.  I know.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  Because there are guys  in there that realize,  okay, if I behave,  I will get out of here,  but there's other guys.  It doesn't matter  what the fuck I do.  I'm never getting out of here,  so that's what I mean  by freeing.  And they do.  It's like, oh, really?  Double, huh?  Ooh.  Yeah.  Yeah, that ain't gonna work.  Here's a guy  who wants to stick up  for Penn State.  This is great. 
[01:45:30]  John in Jersey, go ahead.  What's up, boys?  Hi, John.  Hey.  First off,  I'm not gonna sit here  and try and defend  anything that is going on up there.  Stanidowski's a piece of shit.  The administration  is a piece of shit.  Where I do think  you guys are wrong  is that this isn't  just about football.  This was about the school  trying to protect  the money.  It's not about, like,  Joe's legacy.  That's all shit.  Joe will be the first person  to tell you that his legacy  doesn't mean a damn thing. 
[01:46:00]  And that would have been  before any of this even happened.  This school, like,  the fact that he pushed it  up the chain,  he sent it up to his boss,  he sent it up to the head  of the campus police,  he sent it up to the president  of the university,  and those three assholes  did nothing.  Hold the phone  for two seconds.  Do you think  someone like McQuarrie  gives a shit  about the financial  fucking dealings  of the institution  on such a low level  that he was at  that he didn't go  directly to the police  and say,  this motherfucker 
[01:46:30]  is raping a child  in the shower?  No, no, no.  I mean, really.  That is about,  that's not about the money.  That's about  trying to cover this up  for the purpose  of the legacy  of Penn State football.  And his own gig.  Well, I think it's  more his own job  than it is  any of that other stuff.  Well, don't try to make it  sound like this big,  like, blurry,  gray area corporate thing  where no one's really  accountable for it.  No, no,  they absolutely 
[01:47:00]  should be accountable.  I just think  that the wrong people  are being held accountable.  So let me ask you a question.  McQuarrie was wrong  for not breaking it up,  calling the police.  He needed to do those things.  He's the one who saw it.  He's the one who  should have known  that there was  something wrong.  But I think that  too much of the buck  is being left  at the football team  and not enough of it  is being left  at the people  that are actually  in charge of running  the stupid school.  Okay, fair enough.  But here's the thing.  If that was Paterno's grandson,  do you think that  he would have handled it 
[01:47:30]  by going to Joe Curley  and, uh...  Ah, certainly.  It's raping  the boy in the shower.  Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Yes, do you think  that that's how  he would have handled it  if it was his own grandson?  I don't think anybody  would handle it  if it's their own kid.  Like, if it's anyone's kid,  they're going to handle it  completely differently  than just a dude  with another dude  that he used to work with.  You're... 
[01:48:00]  You are...  And maybe you don't mean to be,  but you're calling in a way  to somehow take...  You are calling...  Your call should have said,  I'm going to kind of  defend Paterno  because I don't believe  that Joe Paterno  didn't care about his legacy.  He absolutely did.  He wanted to have  that last home game  to go out  in a blaze of glory  despite all this.  And of course  he cared about his legacy.  You can't say he didn't.  That's not true.  There's no fucking way  in hell  that McQuarrie  shouldn't have gone  to the police  immediately. 
[01:48:30]  Just go to the fucking police.  Not...  Not the fucking  campus security.  Not the fucking  president of the campus.  The fucking  police department.  And here's why  Paterno is a piece of shit  because he never  confronted Sandusky about it.  Right.  He never spoke  to Sandusky about it.  Alright, hold on guys.  I got two things here.  Uh-oh.  Anthony,  the campus police thing  that they actually  are a legitimate  police force.  Like, there is no  other police force  for Penn State. 
[01:49:00]  Like, they're actually  an accredited...  Alright.  They have a...  They can write tickets.  They can, you know,  arrest...  Well, then why didn't they  arrest Sandusky?  Nobody told them.  I mean,  they went...  He went to Schultz  who...  Admittedly...  Schultz!  But he was...  He was in charge  of the cops.  And the guys  that have said...  Like, McQuarrie said  that he thought  when he was talking  to Schultz,  he thought he was  talking to the police.  Now, isn't Schultz  a civilian guy 
[01:49:30]  who isn't...  No, no, no.  What I've heard about that,  him running the police  department,  is doesn't he run  them in a budget sense?  Like, he's over a bunch  of different departments  and the police is one  that he dictates  the budget for?  Right, just the budget.  It's not like going  to a fucking police captain.  Right.  You're right about that,  Jimmy.  So, come on.  Dude,  and I'm not trying  to interrupt you,  but fucking he never...  Paterno never confronted  Sandusky.  So, fuck him.  But he...  But why... 
[01:50:00]  Like, where was he  going to have the opportunity  to confront Sandusky?  Sandusky didn't work  for him at that time.  But he still had  total access to the school  for years after.  Thank you.  I'm sure he had  his cell number  at the very least.  His total access  to the school  was given to him  by the university president,  not by Paterno.  Okay, but you don't  think Paterno  could have got a hold  of a guy  who he worked with  for years?  I think so.  What's going on?  Why wouldn't you?  But he didn't like him.  He never liked him.  Well, then...  Sandusky...  Then more reason  to fucking blow  the whistle on the guy. 
[01:50:30]  Jesus.  Fuck Joe, pa.  And I know no one  likes to hear that.  Too bad.  I'm sure he did  a lot of great things.  Tough shit.  With allegations  that he fucked...  A 10-year-old  was getting fucked  popped up.  He didn't do enough.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Hey, Jeremy,  I'm not going to tell you  you don't have the right  to have that opinion.  Good.  Don't.  I'm not trying to.  I'm amazed  that there's such  a different opinion  on this one.  I'm really amazed.  These are just fans.  It's unbelievable.  The culture of how 
[01:51:00]  important football is  at Penn State.  The money's a part of it,  sure,  but it's about the legacy  and the pride,  and that's the thing  that makes that part  of Pennsylvania feel proud.  It's the allegiance  to Penn State,  so if Penn State falls,  they feel like they fall,  and what they've held  sacred falls,  so they have an investment  in protecting that  even against overwhelming  evidence that they shouldn't.  I see McQuarrie  as being the worst guy  in this situation  after Sandusky.  I absolutely see McQuarrie  being the worst motherfucker  in this 
[01:51:30]  right after Sandusky.  He should have went  to the fucking cops,  not fucking his daddy,  and then fucking this guy,  Joe Pa,  Joe Pa,  went and talked to Joe Pa  for a little bit,  the president of the company.  If you saw a woman  being raped out back  by a dumpster at Penn State,  would you fucking  go to Joe Pa?  I'd pull my dick out.  Exactly.  After that, though,  you gotta go to the cops.  But Anthony,  especially after he did talk  and not seeing much happening,  he should have kept going  with this thing. 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  And go,  who can I tell next?  This is unbelievable  that no one's doing  anything about this.  Right?  It might be scary,  though,  when you're him  just because you're afraid  no one will believe you,  or it might be like,  like,  that's a very,  for us,  we don't get,  I can say what I want,  you can say what you want,  but when you're in that life,  those guys are fucking,  they ran everything.  He was hoping to be  a head coach himself someday,  so he knew this would  fuck that up.  Right,  so he fucking kept  his mouth shut  at the cost again  of somebody  being sexually abused. 
[01:52:30]  Did the minimum.  Oh, boy.  Yeah,  they're all shitty.  They're all pieces of shit.  They're all just pieces of shit,  and everyone defend,  and people want to defend them,  and Joe Pa this,  and Joe Pa that.  You know how,  if Joe Pa went to the police  and fucking,  and confronted Sandusky,  or followed it up,  you're the head coach  at Penn State  for over,  what,  30 years?  You have a lot of juice  in that town.  Yeah.  You have a lot of fucking pull,  and what you want to happen,  The Jews have to do it.  It happens.  The Jews would kind of,  he would just own them.  Oh, okay.  He had a lot of juice  in that town. 
[01:53:00]  But he went to,  he went to Curly,  whoop,  whoop,  whoop,  whoop,  whoop,  whoop,  whoop,  and then,  hold on,  Steve wants in with John.  Steve in Jersey,  you got,  hey Steve,  John's still on the line.  Yes.  Go ahead,  Steve.  This guy,  John from Jersey,  doesn't know where he started.  There's plenty of blame  to go around.  Just because you're blaming  the administration  doesn't matter.  Joe Pa,  Sandusky,  McQuarrie,  they're all pieces of shit.  The only thing that,  the only thing that Joe Pa  was concerned about  was his legacy. 
[01:53:30]  You don't coach Penn State football  for years until you're 88 years old.  The guy ran the whole fucking school.  Yeah.  It's Jimmy,  like a cult.  He said he ran it.  He ran it.  Ten years prior to it,  everyone would say  that he didn't even control  his own football team.  His legacy kept him there.  They tried to fire him  and he said,  no,  I'm not fired.  I'm going back to work.  He was more important 
[01:54:00]  than the president.  And especially the fact  that he knew  even after Sandusky  was fired,  he was still bringing people  he had access to school  up until the day  he got arrested.  Right,  but that was given to him  by the president,  not by Joe.  So he could have stopped.  Joe Paterno  could have said  this guy was seen  having sex with a 10-year-old.  What's he doing here?  And it would have stopped.  His blind loyalty.  God almighty,  it's embarrassing.  It's unbelievable.  It's really weird.  It's just weird.  Outside the city  of the president, 
[01:54:30]  he was Penn State,  but that's why  it's perfect.  Your phone's cutting out,  buddy.  Whoever's talking right now,  your phone's cutting out.  Yeah,  that's Steve,  unfortunately.  All right,  thank you,  Steve,  but your phone was cutting out.  Yep.  Yes,  again.  Thanks for the phone call.  No problem,  boy.  Love you.  Love the show.  Take care,  guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Of course you do.  It's a blind loyalty.  Some people say  it's not as big of a deal  because it was a boy  and not a girl.  If it was a girl,  that would have been  a different situation.  Maybe,  but still,  Paterno was thinking  about the overall  big picture.  I get so sick 
[01:55:00]  of hearing  the grandfatherly.  This guy was a,  Paterno was a man  who dealt with men  for 50 fucking years.  He wasn't some  doddering old man.  He ran the Penn State  football fucking program.  Yeah.  This guy was a man's man.  Good point,  good point.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  He wasn't some  little fucking  little soft-spoken  accountant  who became  grandfatherly.  This guy dealt  with fucking  6'8 linebackers.  Told them what to do.  And obviously,  he was a lot younger  when all this was  going down, too.  Yeah, 
[01:55:30]  10 years younger.  You know,  we saw that last  press conference  with Joe Pye  outside his house.  Sure.  He looked  an annoying press conference.  He looked a bit weak  and all that,  but  We love you,  Joe Pye.  We're talking about  stuff that happened,  what,  10 years prior,  easily, right?  Yeah,  if not longer.  Oh, well.  Man.  Well,  Sandusky's fucked.  I just wonder  if anybody else  is going to be fucked  in this whole thing.  McQuarrie is a piece of shit,  but I'll say  at least he did  come forward.  I don't blame him  as much for not reacting  in that moment,  even though it's easy 
[01:56:00]  for us to say,  because in that moment,  you're probably  in a state of shock,  and it did stop that.  Like,  he looked and saw it stopped.  Like,  it wasn't like he walked in  and they kept doing it.  But maybe they started it up again  as soon as McQuarrie  got his dumb nose  out of there.  Dude,  I'm going to surmise  that when you're raping  a 10-year-old,  and you're seen,  your dick isn't functioning  for the rest of the night.  You're in panic mode.  You have to be  in panic mode.  You have to be, right?  People just don't... 
[01:56:30]  It's silly,  but no one is...  No, no,  most people get it.  Well,  I mean...  Or most people,  you know,  I guess it's not fair to say,  but most people  agree with us.  Yes.  I just don't see  the other side of this one  at all.  And no one's saying  that Paterno  should go to jail  or that McQuarrie  should go to jail.  I'm not saying anything.  It's tough to put  Joe Pond gel.  Exactly.  Just wheel him in.  You could.  Oh, yes.  Pop him up as an example.  Your joke about this  is fantastic.  It's going to be  part of the special.  Thank you.  You know,  it's a good part  of the special, 
[01:57:00]  and I'm really happy  that it's...  It's very timely right now.  It's going to look out  nice for you.  I have a very insulting  Sandusky bit in my...  Oh, yes.  It's a good solid 10 minutes.  It couldn't have  timed out better.  It's a great 10 minutes.  As long as he doesn't  shoot himself  before June 30th,  it's going to seem perfect.  It's going to be  very topical.  Why don't we take a break?  Jimmy Fallon on the way,  so stay there.  The O.P.  Anthony Channel.  Hey, so funny.  Serious.  I said,  Have you ever wondered 
[01:57:30]  how much hot piss  your body produces  over the course  of your entire life?  How many pounds  of dead, smelly skin  will you shed  into your mattress?  Well, wonder no more, friends.  Join me on my quest  for knowledge and discovery,  seeking answers  to the questions  that man has pondered  since the dawn of time.  On today's episode,  how many farts  would it take  to fill a hot air balloon?  Hot air balloons  come in different shapes  and sizes,  but the average  standard balloon  takes 65,000 cubic feet  of air to lift it. 
[01:58:00]  After squeezing  and sharding  some numbers,  it seems the average  human flattus release  measures 62 milliliters.  That translates  to .0022 cubic feet  per fart,  or as I like to call them,  cubic farts.  That figures out  to 29,545,455 farts.  To put that  in a warm,  moist perspective,  all of Australia  can fart  inside the balloon  with enough room  for all of Austria  to cut one, too. 
[01:58:30]  Unfortunately,  a fart is mostly nitrogen,  and while it is  3% lighter than air,  it's simply not enough  to lift that balloon.  That myth is busted,  but that doesn't mean  we still can't fill  shit up with farts.  Well, not fill  shit up with farts.  I don't even know  how that would work anyway,  and the shit smells  bad enough.  Why would anybody  want to put farts  inside shit?  Anyway,  if you did want  to fuel flight  with farting,  we would need thrust.  The average fart  generates roughly  0.2 newtons.  If you weighed  180 pounds, 
[01:59:00]  just budging you  off the ground  would take 800 newtons.  We would need  upwards of a half  million liters  of fart,  or 8,064,516 farts.  And finally,  the average human  produces about  a half liter of farts  every single day,  so that's one  pint glass full of fart  every single day,  man or woman.  I am buzzed already.  Join us next time 
[01:59:30]  on an all new  How Much.  Coming up next  on an all new  Meet the McGregors,  Mr. Mac invites over  Robbie from next door  to build a birdhouse.  I've got a special  job for you today.  Oh, and steady.  That's the way.  But Mr. Mac has been  drinking bourbon  all afternoon  and has a few  other ideas.  I missed a spot  right up there.  That silly drunk  spills paint  all over young Robbie. 
[02:00:00]  Guess who doesn't  have a change of clothes?  Just take off  your clothes.  I'll help you  clean up.  There.  That feels good,  doesn't it?  Someone better  call the authorities.  Mr. MacGregor  has another naked  boy in his house.  Now, I'm going  to take the picture  to remember  the day we  spilled the paint.  Yeah, that's  what the cops  call Exhibit A.  The fun really  starts when  Mrs. MacGregor  comes home  and finds a  dirty shoebox 
[02:00:30]  full of Polaroids  under the bed.  It all goes  down tonight  on Meet the  MacGregors.  Sirius XM,  this is the  OPNN 3 Show.  Got Jimmy Fallon  stopping by  in about 15-20 minutes.  He's got a CD  called Blow Your  Pants Off,  all the music  from his show.  Meow.  That has done  very well. 
[02:01:00]  All on one CD.  Indeed.  We got a man  interviewed on  the news  and he doesn't  take orders  from women.  Do we have  the video  of this too,  Sam?  He's the boss.  And it will be  on our Facebook  page,  Opie and Anthony,  if you enjoy  what you're hearing.  Just go there  for the visual  element.  The visual  element.  Visual  element.  Did the  bosses get  our thing  down the hall,  you think?  Probably.  All right.  What thing? 
[02:01:30]  Just a thing.  What kind of thing?  Just a thing.  None of your  business.  I want to know.  It's a need-to-know  basis and you  don't need to  know.  Is he being  quiet down the  hall?  I don't know.  I should have  asked you before  the show,  I guess.  Have you heard  anything?  Not a thing.  I haven't heard  a thing.  You think we're  going to hear  a thing?  Yeah,  at some point.  Yeah.  I know.  I get it.  You got the  video,  Sam?  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:02:00]  You want to  play it from  there then?  We're just  talking about a  thing.  We first introduced  you to Jeff  Brown during  7 Action News  at 5.  He witnessed  a man boldly  dumping large  chunks of wood  from a flatbed  along cows on  Detroit's Eastside  Tuesday in broad  daylight.  Brown says when  he confronted the  guy, the man  took off.  Brown tells us he  jumped into action,  got into his car,  and tracked down  the truck.  Why is this guy  doing this?  He's just dumping  logs on a  residential street?  Logs on a  street.  That's great. 
[02:02:30]  Why is he doing  this?  I don't know.  I know there's  a twist in this  whole story,  but I want to  know right away  why would he  do this?  Obviously, he  doesn't want to  bring the logs  somewhere else,  but can't you  find the woods  or something?  It's a  residential street.  Maybe he thought  it was funny.  It's kind of funny.  All right, let's  find out.  He got a license  plate number and  called police, but  the mess remained on  the street and no  one had been caught.  Taking action for 
[02:03:00]  Brown, we did some  digging and found  Ihor Stikevich, a  Warren resident.  The truck Brown  described parked in  the driveway.  Wood covered his  yard.  Stikevich claims he  hit a curb and the  debris accidentally  fell out.  It's a little illegal  to leave the wood in  the street, so what  I'm asking is...  I'm going...  I mean, you don't  have to ask me, and  I don't take no  orders from the  woman, by the way.  By the way, I  don't take no  orders from no  women.  That guy rolls.  I love that regular  people are starting 
[02:03:30]  to kind of notice  that these news  people are just  stupid people.  I don't take no  orders from no  women.  No orders.  Go back.  He looks like an  asshole, doesn't  he?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure he is, but  it's still fun.  It's still fun for  everyone.  It's like Kevin  Costner.  Yeah.  A little illegal  to leave the wood  in the street, so  what I'm asking is...  I'm going...  I mean, you  don't have to ask  me, and I don't  take no orders from  no woman, by the  way.  By the way, I don't  take no orders from  no women.  He said she was  planning to go back  and clean up the 
[02:04:00]  wood, but only had  one dollar's worth of  gas.  So you were saying  that you were going  back to clean up the  wood?  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I'm Mr. Cleanup.  I'm not Mr. Clean.  I'm Mr. Clean Up.  I live in Warren, and  I'm cleaning up  Detroit.  Go figure that one  out.  Somebody said that  they tried to yell  at you to come back,  and you kept going.  It must have been a  woman, and I don't  listen to women.  Once again.  This guy.  I fucking love this 
[02:04:30]  guy.  He's the greatest.  He just fucking  rules.  He's just antagonizing  it.  It must have been a  woman to figure that  one out.  Yeah, with that  accent.  End of story.  So respect.  You had to come back,  and you kept going.  It must have been a  woman, and I don't  listen to women yelling.  I tell them to shut  up.  Quite offensive with  his answers.  Dukovic maintains he  just wants to help  people remove chunks  of wood from their  property.  I lift them all by  myself with nobody 
[02:05:00]  else's help.  Old guys, disabled  guys, black guys,  white guys, Polish  guys.  Ukrainian guys, and  guys from Mars also.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  From Mars?  From Mars.  Yeah, that's where  I'm from.  Mars.  And please, you're  investigating what  exactly happened out  here, and whether  Sikhevich is responsible  or whether he'll face  any charges.  On Detroit's East  Side, Tara Edwards,  7 Action News.  That guy is the  greatest.  He rules.  Oh, I love that. 
[02:05:30]  I love when someone  does that to these  reporters.  Yeah.  Just, they're like,  oh, I got the big  story, the logs that  fell on the street.  Like, now check this  guy out.  I tell him to shut  up.  I tell him to shut  up.  I don't take no  orders from no  women.  I don't listen to no  woman when they're  yelling.  I tell him to shut  up.  Shut up.  He says it twice.  I tell him to shut  up.  Can we hear that  part again, please?  I love it.  That gave me joy.  I tell him to shut  up.  Shut up.  We first introduced  somebody said this. 
[02:06:00]  I live in Warren and  I'm cleaning up Detroit.  Go figure that one  out.  Go figure that one.  Somebody said that  they tried to yell at  you to come back and  you kept going.  It must have been a  woman and I don't  listen to women yelling.  I tell them to shut  up.  I tell them to shut  up.  Oh, he's all man,  that guy.  Love him.  I fucking love him.  You want to hear the  funniest story?  Oh, I real.  I thought I didn't  have my ID today. 
[02:06:30]  So I called Kenny and  he met me downstairs and  I realized it was in my  pocket the whole fucking  time.  Jimmy.  Just in case people  don't believe me.  Listen, this is ID.  That's my ID.  That's guy who's making  a big deal out of  something that is just  uninteresting.  Nothing.  TV land to cut Don  Rickles, Obama joke  from the Shirley  McClain AFI tribute.  It's too bad.  It's too bad because  Mr. Rickles has been  telling those type of 
[02:07:00]  jokes his entire career.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A bit racy, a bit edgy  at times.  They're saying they're  editing for time  purposes, but we all  know what the real  thing is here.  What was the joke  again about the  mop?  I shouldn't make fun  of the blacks.  President Obama is a  personal friend of  mine.  He was over at the  house the other day.  The mop broke.  Something like that.  There you go.  Good joke by Mr.  Rickles.  Yeah.  I guess it's harmful  to tell jokes like  that now.  Yeah, it's terrible.  It's bad news.  Hurts everyone. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  I think they think  they skated when it  first happened live.  You know, I think  they're like, oh boy,  I hope we don't get  heat for this.  And it did kind of  blow over and they  probably feel if they  televise it, then they  might get some shit.  Who cares?  You know, who cares?  River now.  River now has kept his  mouth shut.  Yeah, about this.  But if it's televised,  it's almost like they're  they're grinding it in, 
[02:08:00]  you know, it's bullshit.  So you agree with this?  Yeah, wholeheartedly.  I agree with this.  I think Don Rickles  should apologize.  I agree.  To our African-American  friends.  Yep.  And a boy.  Yes, indeed.  And a boy, dude.  Let me say that.  Yeah, I can't figure it  out.  I don't know.  Hey, see that  Ape Lincoln movie?  See that thing?  I did that on purpose. 
[02:08:30]  I know.  See where we were all  going.  I knew I had nothing.  I'm just sitting here.  I kind of like the chill.  I like when we just chill  for a second.  Just go.  It doesn't always have to  be words, words, words,  words, words, words, words,  words, words, words, words,  words.  The old days, we would  have to fill up everything  with words.  Just panicking because  there isn't a noise coming  out of everyone's speaker  for one second.  Look, it was a strange  moment there for a second,  but it's okay. 
[02:09:00]  There's nothing wrong  with that.  What Ape Lincoln movie?  Ape Lincoln versus the  vampires.  Oh, the new movie?  Yeah, yeah.  It's out already?  Well, it's coming out.  You got a copy?  No, but I saw the behind  the scenes.  It's like first look on  HBO.  Right.  And it's like an extended  kind of trailer thing.  I think we're going to be  interviewing a few people  from that movie.  Yeah.  It's just an odd thing.  Like Abe, who thought of  putting Abe Lincoln in a role  of a vampire hunter? 
[02:09:30]  It's just an odd thing.  I did.  Like Abe Lincoln's becoming  this weird kind of mythical  heroic thing over the years.  Let me see this.  Is this the trailer?  Turn it this way so I can  see it, please.  Look, we're back on track.  I like it.  Turn it.  I can't see it.  We're back on track, people.  Back on track.  Stop.  I can't see it.  There's a circle in the  middle.  What is this?  The circle shell?  Yeah, why is it just a circle?  However history remembers me  before I was a president,  I shall always think of myself  as a hunter. 
[02:10:00]  Wow.  That's bloody.  Mother, I was just a boy.  There is darkness everywhere,  Mr. Lincoln.  I think you say that again.  I'll teach you how to save them  and how to destroy them.  I will give you names  and you will hunt them down.  It fools to us, Abraham,  to ensure this remains  a nation of men.  They're not monsters. 
[02:10:30]  Fucking Lincoln's badass.  How do we begin?  Looks cool as shit.  Lincoln.  There is a war coming.  Civil war vampires.  I shall kill them all.  Only the living can kill the dead.  This hunter,  they say he's a madman.  Four.  I feel like I'm on the 
[02:11:00]  Cinemagic channel right now.  Crazy.  Really loud.  The empire's got a nation of our hope.  On a stage.  Oh, no.  What I don't understand  is why they're making this movie  with Abe Lincoln.  It could be anybody.  It's hilarious.  I'm very confused now.  I don't know why either.  Visually, it looks great.  The blood looks great.  The action looks great.  But it's Abe Lincoln.  Why?  And why didn't a vampire get him?  How did Booth get him in the movies?  Yeah.  Yeah, really? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, right?  You would think he would be  a lot more aware  if he went through this shit.  I think because of his  other history with bloodsuckers.  I think they're going to have  Lincoln be a...  I bet you the rival vampire guy  is going to be John Wilkes Booth.  Yes.  And that's going to be the thing.  He kills him.  He's for the vampires.  Exactly.  So he shoots him  and then he breaks his leg.  I saw Funny recently on...  Did I tell you that?  1954 on like  Guess Your Line  or Who Is Your Life?  They had an old guy 
[02:12:00]  who was the last living witness  to the Lincoln assassination.  No way.  Could we find that clip?  Well, Danny could.  It's fucked up.  What show is it?  Oh, shit.  Last...  Now put Kennedy...  Lincoln assassination witness.  You cocksucker.  The guy was 94.  He was in the theater.  He was five when it happened.  That's it!  That's it!  I got it.  Oh, man.  Wait, we got...  We actually have  a video clip of a guy  that witnessed...  What?  Lincoln's assassination.  He was in the theater.  From 1956.  He had to zip through it a little bit.  He was really old, this guy. 
[02:12:30]  Holy fuck.  He died.  But what does he remember  if he was only five?  Well, he'll...  What show is this?  I have a lot of questions.  Guess Your Line or some shit?  Right, right.  I've got a secret.  I've got a secret.  I've got a secret.  I've got a secret.  Oh, it's going to have to figure out  what the guy's secret.  No, man.  He's in trouble.  You know what happened?  Oh, chipper.  But, man, what do you know  about the Abe Lincoln movie  before we play this clip?  Why does it have to be Abe Lincoln?  What is that based on?  I think because it's kind of hip now  to have Lincoln  as this mythical character.  I don't know where it came from.  Okay.  Probably a fucking comic book. 
[02:13:00]  The movie itself looks cool, though.  It's based on books.  Of course it is.  Graphic novels.  The graphic novels.  Yeah.  All right, let's see this.  Now then,  I would like to go over  and personally escort  our next guest on the show tonight.  Isn't that...  What's his name?  Oh, my God.  This guy's ancient.  Ancient, yeah,  and he's very slowly  walking with a cane.  1956.  He's 94.  Wow.  Give him a lucky.  94. 
[02:13:30]  He's old.  Now then, sir,  will you tell our panel, please?  Let's get in a little closer.  Am I supposed to be ancient?  There's a Winston cigarette ad  in front of him.  Can you tell our panel, please,  what your name is  and where you're from?  My name is Samuel J. Seymour.  I'm from Maryland.  This is Mr. Seymour from Maryland.  And we brought Mr. Seymour  all the way up from Maryland  and by and golly,  he got in a hotel  and fell down the steps  and gave himself a shiner.  Oh, my God.  And we urged him  not to come on the show tonight 
[02:14:00]  as a matter of fact  and finally got in touch  with his doctor  and the doctor said  it was up to Mr. Seymour.  Holy shit.  Mr. Seymour said  he wouldn't miss it.  So here he is.  Doctor smoking a cigarette.  What's he having to lose it?  I'm going to be here.  Fucking doddering idiot  fell down the steps.  I want to be on the TV.  How are they, Mr. Seymour?  Is he smoking?  How old are you, by the way, sir?  No, I don't.  96.  96.  96 years old.  96 years young.  96 in 1956.  Now, sir, if you'll whisper  your secret to me,  I'm sure the folks at home  would like to know what it is.  I hate Negroes. 
[02:14:30]  I shit my pants.  Jesus Christ.  Pause this real quick.  On the TV, it says,  here's what it says,  the graphic comes up,  I saw John Wilkes Booth  shoot Abraham Lincoln  April 14, 1865.  Now, here's my question.  If it's a secret,  he's whispering it to the guy,  if we're seeing that at home,  the audience is applauding  as that graphic comes up,  who is it a secret from?  What do you mean? 
[02:15:00]  Oh, it's from the panel.  Is it a game?  There's a panel of people?  Oh, I'm sorry.  There's a panel.  Okay, that one.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy.  But in a way, you're right,  because when you want  to guess at home,  well, you could turn your head.  No, I didn't know the panel.  Okay, that makes sense.  I would turn my head.  Well, they didn't say  turn your head.  No, they didn't.  See, you would have been like,  fuck, why didn't they say  turn my head?  Yeah.  See?  All right, let's do this.  Well, now to help  classify his secret,  I will tell you a concern,  something that he witnessed.  And Bill Cullen, 
[02:15:30]  we'll start with you.  Bill Cullen?  Something that he saw.  Something he saw happen.  This thing that Mr. Seymour saw,  does it have  historical significance?  No.  Does this have  historical significance?  No, not at all.  I would say yes.  Wouldn't you, sir?  No.  My head hurts.  I didn't fall.  I was punched  by a darker person.  Here's a clue.  Look at my own head.  He removed my stovepipe hat.  Yeah.  He asked me for directions 
[02:16:00]  and I said,  North,  and he punched me  with his fist.  I woke up  85 years later.  Poor gentleman.  Significance.  it had political  significance at the time.  Yes.  Yes.  Of course it did.  Has it made  movie theaters louder?  Has it made  pornography much better? 
[02:16:30]  Has it knocked  white people  right out of pornography?  Time?  Yes.  Meh.  Bill Cullen  knows already.  Well, if you're 96,  Mr. Seymour  born in  He's doing math.  1660.  Henry,  you're such a mathematician.  Yeah.  He's been writing over there.  Battle of Gettysburg,  I bet he thinks first, right?  Yeah,  because you don't think  five years old.  This thing,  does it have anything  to do with the  Civil War, 
[02:17:00]  Mr. Seymour?  Let's see.  No,  it had not to do  with the Civil War.  Let's say indirectly  it was concerned  with the Civil War.  Ah,  I see right there.  Did it...  Are it answering?  Did it concern  a famous person?  He just blurted it out.  I saw Lincoln shot.  Oh,  you dummy.  It was a theater  we were watching  and his head fell off.  Like fucking  Tippi Tom.  They got a airplane.  Best clip ever.  Oh,  yeah.  Doddering fool  doesn't know  it's television.  Can you start a famous person,  Mr. Seymour?  They're just chatting with him. 
[02:17:30]  Yep.  Would it help me  to know who this person was?  He wants to know  if it would help him  to know who this person was  and he has to know  who that is,  yes.  Was this man...  Did this man  hold political office?  Oh,  come on.  Did this man hold  political office, sir?  Say,  was he president?  Yes.  Bill Cullen knows this.  $20 down  and $60 to go  and we go to Jane Meadows.  Jane Meadows?  Mr. Seymour?  Is it Ralph Cramden?  That's Audrey Meadows' sister. 
[02:18:00]  Oh,  I thought that was her.  No,  that's just her sister,  though.  Jane.  What did Jane Meadows do?  Jane Meadows didn't do  as much as Audrey Meadows,  but...  She did game shows.  Yeah,  she did like game shows,  yeah.  And Joyce Randolph.  And Joyce Randolph.  That yelling announcer.  I know,  why are they shouting?  The Honeymooners  with the stars  at Connie.  What was that about?  Jackie Gleason,  The Honeymooners.  They're actually  redoing The Honeymooners now?  It's so irritating.  What?  They're remaking  The Fucking Honeymooners. 
[02:18:30]  No, they're not.  Yes, they are.  With the stars,  Chip Chippison,  Paul Hoggis,  Ted Sheckler,  and Edgar Mellencamp.  Edgar Mellencamp.  You're the ass.  Here,  let's get through this clip  because I know  Fallon's going to  appear at any moment.  Being his usual  helpful self  by whispering  to Jane McKinley.  And I'm not listening.  Mr. Seymour,  would this person  have ever been  president of the United States?  Was he ever  president, this man? 
[02:19:00]  I think he was.  Would it have been  Abraham Lincoln?  It was Abraham Lincoln,  yes.  You witnessed something  to do with Abraham Lincoln?  Oh, boy.  Was this a pleasant thing?  Yes!  A pleasant thing,  you saw, sir?  Yes.  I was scared to death,  so.  Oh.  He said,  no,  he was scared to death.  Would it have had  anything to do  with the president  Lincoln's death  by any chance?  Right.  Fortunately, yes.  Did Mr. Seymour  witness the shooting  of President Lincoln? 
[02:19:30]  Yay,  the shooting  of President Lincoln.  They're applauding it.  Yeah,  see,  the time takes care  of everything.  He found out  about Mr. Seymour  through a recent article  in the American Weekly  and said,  I saw a big shot  in this article  by Samuel J. Seymour.  And it goes on  to say that Mr. Seymour  was five years old  at the time.  He had been taken  to Ford's Theater  by some good friends.  And the curious thing  was that when he was  five years of age,  when he saw Booth  jump from the box  to the stage, 
[02:20:00]  at which time  he broke his leg.  His only concern  was not that the president,  because he didn't realize  that the president  had been shot,  but the poor man  who fell out of the balcony.  John Rose spoofed.  He broke his leg.  Sir,  it's been a great joy  and you might say  I'm honored.  You are,  by the way,  the only living witness  of that tragic event.  And we are certainly  going to forfeit  the complete $80 to you  just for...  80 bucks?  That's 56 bucks,  though. 
[02:20:30]  That equals $18,000  right now.  And I told him  before the show,  I said,  I'm going to give you  a card  in the Winstons  and Mr. Seymour  said,  I don't smoke cigarettes.  What?  So he smokes a pipe.  So we have  crossed the bounds  tonight.  We're giving him  a can of Prince Albert  pipe tobacco instead.  Prince Albert in a can?  Yeah.  You better let him out.  If you're going to give him  some Prince Albert,  they're going to  piss his cock out.  What are you doing?  That hurts.  It's time,  anyhow,  to take care of  our Winston movie  for tonight.  It's got a corny plot,  I warn you, 
[02:21:00]  but there is a certain  freshness and good taste  with all.  I'm just amazed  by the Winston angle.  That's great.  They would give  their guests  cards of cigarettes  as a party gift.  They're trying to give  a 96-year-old man  cigarettes.  I'm just amazed  by that.  How fucking hilarious  is that?  And now we've got  a dumb mayor  that wants to get rid  of our sugary drinks.  They used to give away  cigarettes on game show.  The Prince Albert,  they take him  into the back,  they're holding his arms.  What are you doing?  And they're just  roughly pulling  his trousers down  and they put ice 
[02:21:30]  on his cock.  It's cold.  It's very cold.  What is that  sharp implement?  They fucking...  And you tell him,  you know what  Booth did to Lincoln's  head?  We're going to do it  to your prick.  Put a nice hole in it.  I don't know  what it is.  Put alcohol on it.  Holy fuck.  They gave away cigarettes.  Put that guy's name  in the search engine  and find out  when he died. 
[02:22:00]  He died two months  after that.  He did.  You don't know.  Two months after that,  they said in...  And he also,  he said that he  remembered Lincoln  waving at people  when he sat down.  He did see Lincoln alive.  He said everything  I'm like,  I'm like,  I'm fucked up.  That is fucked up.  I think we could  squeeze a break in  because I don't see Fallon.  History.  He's still on.  He's still on,  so why don't we  take a break,  get our leaks  out of the way.  When we get back,  we'll have Jimmy Fallon  promoting his new CD  Blow Your Pants Off.  Oh, I like the sound  of that one.  Maybe we got more  audio of this guy.  He rules.  Yeah, I would like  to hear... 
[02:22:30]  Prince Albert.  Jimmy comes up  with the thought  of this guy  getting an actual...  96 years old  getting his dick pierced.  Prince Albert.  Against his will.  Oh, of course,  against his will.  As a parting gift.  What are you doing?  But he can't fight back.  He's collapsing.  The blood's dripping  down his saggy balls.  Yeah.  Gets infected.  That's what he died of.  He died of a fucking  cock infection.  From his Prince Albert?  Yeah, from his Prince Albert.  He makes it from 19... 
[02:23:00]  From 1860.  He winds up dying  of a cock infection.  They didn't even treat it.  They just put the thing in  and they pulled  his old man underwear  back up.  His stained underwear.  Cauterized it  with a lit Winston.  Yeah.  Go home now, Burden.  That's when they saw  he was a centerfold  for Burden Monthly.  He was sitting  in the living room  with an afghan  on his lap  and everybody was  looking at him  irritated.  That was the fucking poster.  All right, should we break?  Oh, yeah.  The O.P. Anthony Channel.  Who taught you  how to do this stuff? 
[02:23:30]  You, all right?  I learned it by watching you.  On Sirius XM.  The kids are running wild  because school's out  but cool's in.  No reason to get antsy.  Cal, where are you  getting them in your pouncy?  It's Valley Gym.  Oh, my God.  California is trend-setting again  with all the coolest slang  and wackiest situations.  That is so grody.  Hey, Jim.  Did you, like, hear 
[02:24:00]  that Sheila was totes  making out with Brad?  Oh, makes me want to barf.  Tag along  as the crew lives,  laughs,  but also learns.  Uh, like,  oh, my God.  Have you heard  what's going on  in Uganda?  Joseph Coney  is full of baloney.  Jim is the queen  of the valley  and in the valley  we don't take guff.  Well, maybe you can't  hear this.  Oops, turn it up.  Middle finger time.  Like,  that's my grandmother. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, my God.  You're so old  you should call dirt  by name or something.  And a special appearance  by President Ronald Reagan.  Yes, hello,  well,  whatever.  You're, uh,  grody.  Yes.  Gag me with a spoon, mommy.  It's Valley Jim  coming very soon  to a theater near you.  Well,  how am I supposed to talk?  Like,  with my butt or something?  Sirius XM.  XM. 
[02:25:00]  This  is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Jimmy Fallon will be here  eventually.  He's still on,  I guess he's still on Stern.  A lot of people  bitch, uh,  to us when we go late,  when we go along  with a guest.  It's so weird.  We don't care.  That's why I want  no communication  from anybody.  I know they have to come in  and go two minutes  into the headset.  I get that.  That's why we don't want  them in the room. 
[02:25:30]  I don't want to see them.  Exactly.  I mean,  if he's going  to promote...  No.  I don't know  what you're thinking,  but I know  what I'm thinking.  Valogen.  Yeah.  It's Valogen.  Very popular.  No.  Really not.  Oh my God.  Yes it is.  Well, welcome back.  He's on his way.  Can I get you something?  Sam.  Young Samuel.  Can I get you something?  Like a watch? 
[02:26:00]  Oh my God.  If late this was a sickness,  you'd be in the hospital.  I'm not late.  You're back from break late.  Yes you are.  I was in the office  doing something.  What were you doing?  I was monitoring.  I was monitoring.  Jimmy Fallon  on Howard Show.  Well, you shouldn't be  listening to other shows.  You should be in here  doing your duty.  I wanted to see  if he was still on the air  or not.  Yeah, well,  whatever you wanted to do,  you should have seen that 
[02:26:30]  on the break  and not like on Showtime.  God, do I hate that.  Well, where's Jim Norton?  Jim Norton's the one  who's back from break late.  Yeah, well,  why don't you take  your beeswax  and start minding it?  Mind your own beeswax.  That's so grody.  It's embarrassing.  Gag me with a spoon  with your loss.  Why are you doing this?  I don't know. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, good.  Eat another Pop-Tart.  I'm not going to eat it right now.  Oh, yeah.  Calories.  Yeah, you should talk to me  about calories.  Oh, shit.  I don't eat Pop-Tarts.  It doesn't look like it.  Yeah?  Cal, why don't you look  in the mirror  and get some glasses?  My self-awareness  is on par.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know  where par is,  but it needs to be off par.  You're grody. 
[02:27:30]  What does grody mean?  Yeah, you should take  a mirror and look at it  and then you'll go,  oh, that's what grody means.  Same stuff  talking about mirrors.  Exactly.  It doesn't make sense.  Yeah, well, you know  what makes sense?  The change machine  or something.  Why is Sam encouraging this?  Sense.  Why are you encouraging this?  Well, I don't think  when people talk badly  about me,  so I'm going to say  something.  I'm not talking badly  about you.  I'm just telling you  to be on time.  I wouldn't be on par.  You should be on time.  So why don't you get a clock  and, like, stand on it 
[02:28:00]  or something?  Will you let this run out of gas?  Will you shut the fuck up?  You're so gross.  Shut the fuck up.  Let it run out of gas.  Yeah.  Like a natural gas springs.  It'll run out.  Or something.  I don't know what you're saying.  I'm just saying  I was on time.  Yeah, I'm sure you were.  I was.  You're not gnarly.  Yes, I am.  Whoa.  You should be hearing  Jimmy Fallon right now.  Yeah, but apparently  he's busy or something. 
[02:28:30]  I don't know what he's doing.  He's also late.  I guess you guys went  to the two grody  school of time  or something.  Two grody school  of times.  What does that even mean?  We could go to the same school.  You don't like Valley Gym, man?  I hate Valley Gym.  Oh, I love your beloved characters,  but...  That's the one that gets you?  Oh, God, it gets me.  Yeah.  You seen this toddler  fall out of the fucking SUV?  Yeah, it was terrible.  Oh, jeez.  Just like that.  Oh, it falls down. 
[02:29:00]  What's going on there?  Dude, it's fucking amazing.  What is that about?  SUV, four teens  were charged with robbery.  That thing rolled  and the kid was ejected  from the vehicle  and just starts running.  And then they pull away.  The kid falls down.  Wait, the kid,  they were stealing the truck?  Yeah, they were being chased  by the cops  and the truck flipped over  and the kid was thrown  from the truck.  Jesus.  Is that it?  Yeah, right there.  What?  Thing rolls. 
[02:29:30]  Let me see.  ...control and flipped,  sending the toddler  out of the window  and onto the street,  but amazingly,  the child was able  to stand up  and walk away.  Police later arrested  four teenagers  in the chase,  all of this  over a stolen purse.  Oh, my God.  The man suspected...  Oh, my God,  to flip all dipsy  doodling around like that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God,  that would flip me out.  I tried.  It's a pun.  I went to a story,  but...  You did.  Ugh. 
[02:30:00]  Valley gym.  This is where  the guests need  to be on time.  Oh, God.  Yeah, we go to Valley gym.  Exactly.  Yeah, well,  I don't know  what we're supposed to do  and the SUVs  are dipsy doodling  all over the place.  Stop saying that.  Dipsy doodle.  Here's your toddler.  Throw it out the window  or something, you know?  No.  Nobody knows.  They just started  discussing who's on the album? 
[02:30:30]  Well, I mean,  when I came in,  they did.  People are saying,  I don't know.  They're saying that  Howard's doing this  on purpose.  He was wrapping up.  Well, it seemed like  he was wrapping up  like maybe five minutes ago,  but then they started  talking about  who's on the album.  Wrapping up?  What?  Does he have a gift  factory in there?  No.  Valley chip.  Yeah, well,  you're Valley kumia.  Let me get that one.  I swear I'm not.  But they were in  plug mode. 
[02:31:00]  Like, they were in  the interview's  ending soon mode.  It'll happen soon.  Once you're in,  once you get into Valley,  you can't get out of it.  It's a fun place to be.  Yeah?  I think we should  have Valley Day  where everyone  just does it all day.  Whose Valley  would you be  most excited about?  I don't know,  but I'm just  a Valley galley.  I'll get something  else stuck in your head.  I'm just an  old-fashioned love song.  What about  the Valley virus?  Ah, I forgot  about the virus. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, you did?  I forgot about  the virus.  Now the virus?  I forgot about them.  We might need  the virus because  we need something  right now.  Yeah, we want  the Valley virus.  I forgot all  about the virus.  Does he like  doing the virus?  I think he loves  the virus.  E-Rock, you like  doing the virus?  Tearing down a wall  here, I know,  but do you like  doing it?  He threw his  headphones down.  Oh, he's not happy.  You like the virus 
[02:32:00]  character?  No.  Is that the mic  up for the Valley virus?  All right.  Yeah, oh my God.  This is going to be  a hoot and a  holler.  We haven't done  the virus in a while,  so for the newer  listeners, it's,  I don't even know  how to describe  the virus anymore.  It's a comic, I guess.  Yeah, he's a comic.  And all we ask  is that he gives  us one punchline.  Yeah, a joke  about a topical story.  One lousy punchline  where he goes,  did he hear about  Sandusky trial?  And then he has  something.  He's coming in 
[02:32:30]  without his intro.  Oh, no.  Where's your intro music?  And Kenny should  love the studio.  Kenny, you want  to welcome him  to the big intro  for him?  Yeah.  Valley virus, is it?  Yeah.  Valley virus.  Ladies and gentlemen,  you're in for a special  treat.  For the first time  this morning,  please let's welcome  the Valley virus.  Oh, yeah.  Valley virus.  He's miserable. 
[02:33:00]  There he comes.  The Valley virus.  Here he comes.  Valley virus,  now in charge  of the interns.  Supervising his own  bit right now.  Hi.  A little weird.  Yeah.  Come on,  do the hi guys thing.  Hi guys.  Hey, virus.  It doesn't sound  very Valley-ish to me.  Another character  I hate.  Come on,  let's do a Valley joke  or something. 
[02:33:30]  Well,  the virus didn't  have anything prepared.  We have one punchline  we need because  the Howard Stern show  wrapped up with  Jimmy Flynn.  What about Sandusky?  Oh, man.  There you go.  Yeah, do the setup  of something topical.  Set up Sandusky.  Yeah, that's good.  Hurry up now,  Valley virus. 
[02:34:00]  Did you hear?  It's usually pretty good.  Did you hear about Sandusky?  Something like that.  You have to start with  oh my God,  did you hear?  Oh, no.  That's true.  It isn't Valley.  Oh, my God.  Did you hear  about Sandusky?  Yeah, we sure did.  What's going on there?  Valley virus.  What, do we not  have ears or something?  Just one punchline. 
[02:34:30]  Come on.  Or Jimmy Fallon.  I don't give a fuck.  Well, once Jimmy Fallon  gets here,  you can watch the virus  trying to find a punchline.  Oh, yeah,  that'll be good.  Don't even worry about it.  Oh, yeah,  you better get it done  before Fallon.  Come on there, virus.  That's a good idea, Sam.  I like that idea a lot.  So I would get it over  with now  if we have to do it  in front of Fallon.  Watch Fallon discovers you  and you do this  once a week on his show.  Just make a Sandusky joke up.  Yes.  You guys just wanted  one punchline? 
[02:35:00]  I would want like 80,  actually, but...  You know what?  Should we save this  for Fallon?  You want to put it on hold?  I don't know.  What do you think?  And then we could have  the reintroduction  and everything?  What are you thinking?  Oh, why not?  Why not?  I got no qualms.  Oh, it looks like  it sounds like  they're walking back  right now.  Oh, shit.  You better hurry up  with a punchline  or you're going to be  lined up for a punch.  Let's do this for Fallon.  Why not?  Why not?  You already know this.  Oh, boy.  Iraq is like,  oh, God. 
[02:35:30]  You could do this  in front of Fallon, right?  It just made his eyes  real wide.  It's an A&B conversation.  What's going on  in your head?  You don't like  Valley Gym?  Oh, it's the worst.  I hate Valley Gym.  Well, guys,  the virus has a really  bad Sandusky joke.  Oh.  Oh, all right.  Whoa.  Well, let's hear this,  virus.  What a rep, virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus. 
[02:36:00]  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  What is Jerry Sandusky's  favorite kid's show?  I don't know.  I'm not familiar  with his life.  I don't know  what his life is.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, he might.  We got to have  we got to  Hey, there he is.  We got to have  Jimmy Fallon  involved with this.  Jimmy.  Oh, wherever.  Wherever you feel  comfortable, sir.  Yeah, take a seat. 
[02:36:30]  You're a little late,  which we don't give a fuck  about, so we're in the  middle of a bit, and now  we want you to be part  of this little bit.  It's a terrific fucking  bit we do from time to  time.  Sorry about the small  studio.  Yeah.  You were just in the  lap of luxury over there.  I love it in here.  This is perfect in here.  This is all you need.  This is a good bit.  How are you doing?  Yeah, yeah.  This is...  You're going to be  really disappointed.  He does a character  called The Virus,  and he's an up-and-coming  comic, and all we ask  from him is to do  one punchline.  On a topical subject  like the Sandusky  trial.  Kind of like what 
[02:37:00]  you do every night.  Topical humor.  Topical humor.  And all he has to do  is one punchline.  That's all we ask him  for is one.  Right.  Just one.  Just one on the  Sandusky thing.  Oh, the guitar.  So why don't we play  your music again there,  Virus.  All right.  All right.  Quick, quick...  It's got to be  clean, though.  You like it?  It's a walking  elephant or something?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we think he's fat.  He is a little chubby.  He's a little chubby.  We all see it.  All right.  The Virus.  Yeah.  And he does a wacky voice, 
[02:37:30]  so don't be alarmed.  Fallon might steal this.  You never know.  Or have you come  on the show and do it.  I wish he would.  Sandusky.  Yeah, yeah.  Sandusky.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  Hey, Virus.  What's going on?  Jimmy Fallon just  shook his head.  He's trying to go  like, Virus.  Oh, boy.  Why the voice?  Yeah, what is that voice?  It's like a muppet.  Yeah.  We force him  to do this voice, too, Jimmy.  I'm a muppet.  It's terrible.  All right.  Go ahead.  Hi.  Hi, guys.  Do I look at him  or just listen?  Whichever you can stomach.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:38:00]  He's looking away.  One or the other.  Both are an impossibility.  All right.  Getting a little warm.  I see you unbid your sweatshirt.  I'm very sweaty.  You're uncomfortable.  All right.  Sandusky, come on.  Give us one punchline.  One joke.  Hey, guys.  Do you know what  Jerry Sandusky's  favorite kid show is?  What?  Wow.  His favorite kid show?  No.  We don't know about his favorite kid show.  Yo, grab a grab a.  All right.  Get off.  Jesus.  Welcome to our show. 
[02:38:30]  Sorry about that, Jimmy.  Jimmy Fallon.  Yes.  I'll give it up for him.  Jimmy.  I'm really excited to hear that.  Yo, grab a grab a.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Pretty good.  I got a laugh out of it, right?  You did come out of it.  Yeah.  I just said it louder.  Yeah, yeah.  I took the virus as a joke.  You got a laugh.  I'm going to steal that.  Yo, grab a grab a.  Actually, that one was too good for the virus.  It was a little too good.  What is that thing you have?  It upset me.  This thing?  It's a harmonica.  It's a harmonica.  Did you ever see Bob Dylan?  Yes.  He wears one of those. 
[02:39:00]  A little harmonica thing.  Oh, you wear it on your neck.  Yeah, yeah.  How long have you been playing?  What have you played your whole life?  Guitar?  I think I started when I was 13, I want to say.  I'm making up.  There's probably a thing.  I should do research on this.  Was it a passion for music or chicks?  You wanted to be a rock star.  Yeah.  I think it was.  Yeah.  Girls.  I started playing piano.  My sister played piano.  I started doing that and that wasn't for me.  Yeah.  And then I picked up clarinet.  Oh, you can't rock with a clarinet. 
[02:39:30]  That's just the worst.  I mean, how do you jam out?  Like, hey, you guys?  You guys know any Benny Goodman?  You guys playing over at the garage?  Yeah, I'll come over.  I'll bring my clarinet.  Yeah, I'll bring my clarinet.  Like, get lost.  I learned some Jepland.  Not his comedy, but his music.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  I saw Woody Allen.  Where?  At one of the hotels, right?  Yeah, at the Carlisle.  Is that where he does it?  It's awesome.  It's fantastic.  Just seeing him?  That's what everyone says.  It's like, he has a jazz band, almost like a big band type of thing.  It's like a Dixieland type of thing.  Wow, that's so weird.  It's great.  And I talked to him afterwards, just because I wanted, so I saw him afterwards. 
[02:40:00]  I go, that was great.  I go, I didn't know that, because you can get different notes from the clarinet.  I go, when you go down, you get one note, it's like, and then when you go up, it's  more of a tenor thing.  Oh, that's weird.  He goes, you know, when I went up, that was for you.  Oh, wow.  Give me a break.  Really?  He knew, he probably said that a thousand times.  Now, he doesn't do it, but did you try to get him on the show?  He's almost impossible to book, obviously.  I don't try to do that.  You don't try to book guests when you're out? 
[02:40:30]  I don't.  You would love to have Woody on your show, though.  I'd love to have Woody Allen on the show, yeah.  I mean, we probably will.  I remember there was some show or something on the eighth floor by Saturday Night Live,  and the booker always kept trying to get me on the show every day, because they were  on the same floor.  And I was like, now I'm not going to do it.  Oh, shit.  I was thinking about doing it, but now it's just so annoying.  That's not fun.  I don't feel like I want to do this. 
[02:41:00]  So on our show, I'm just like, hey, if you want to come on, just ask us.  Which room is Woody in?  Because there's two rooms.  The Carlisle, when you first walk in to your right, there's a room where there's a stage,  and then there's a lounge where there's like a piano in the middle of the room.  What, are you going to rob the place?  Well, yeah.  Chasing the whole leg out.  In and out.  Nobody gets hurt.  There's a vent that leads up to the third floor.  There's a safe in the wall.  There's a safe in the wall.  We'll take that clarinet and we'll set on an event.  There's a picture of JFK and there's a picture of Jackie coming out of the clarinet. 
[02:41:30]  That was, by the way, the last place that Mimi Beardsley had sex with JFK was in the Carlisle  the week before he was assassinated.  Oh.  The one who had the 18-month affair with Kennedy.  The intern.  The intern.  The 18-year-old intern that kept her mouth shut.  Jackie Kennedy lived 50 years or something.  When they used to, you know, shut up.  Right.  The good old days.  Yeah.  The good old days.  Who did you used to listen to when you first started playing guitar and stuff?  Who was like, I want to be like that?  I think you start off, Roy Orbison was a big thing.  Really? 
[02:42:00]  That was like, I don't know why.  Yeah, it's kind of an, I mean, Roy Orbison was great, but it's kind of an odd thing to.  I don't know, maybe it was because it was like, he would sing, he was like, the operatic  singing, like, yeah.  Yeah.  I remember just going like, wow, that is just.  That's a powerful voice he had, man.  I didn't see that ending coming at all.  Yeah.  It just keeps going up and up.  This is insane.  This is like, that's my first opera or something.  I didn't know Roy could do this.  I only get my opera from the J.G. Wentworth commercials. 
[02:42:30]  That's pretty much, that's all, that's the only opera.  But I feel I'm a little more cultured for it.  Cultured from that, yeah.  So I got into that, and then like, when I started playing guitar, Rolling Stones and  Bruce Springsteen.  Oh, okay.  You got.  When you get a, like, I started with an electric guitar, because that's the way to do it.  Yeah.  But it's not.  It turns out you've got to start with an acoustic, so you know what's going on, and  then you get into the electric.  Yeah, yeah.  So I got electric first, and I would just play, like, chords, and I'd play Wipeout.  That was the only song I knew I'd play.  And I remember I went to my friend's party, had like a, I think it was like a Sweet Sixteen 
[02:43:00]  party or something like that.  Do you guys have those parties?  Not really.  Some, perhaps?  Anyways, well, this guy was just me and him in his room.  No, I'm just kidding.  No, he had a giant, big Sweet Sixteen party.  Some of you, he's a nice guy.  And he had a band and all this stuff, and his parents threw him this big, giant party  like they do on MTV.  Right, yeah.  And the band was like, he was like, my friend plays guitar. 
[02:43:30]  And I was like, well, not really.  I mean, I have one, but I don't.  And so, but the one song I knew was Wipeout, and I got up, and I played Wipeout with the  band.  And it was, and I was.  You were a rock star.  15 or something.  And I was like.  Oh, man.  That was super cool.  It was like in front of a, it was just spare the moment.  And it was like, that was the first night I ever heard Led Zeppelin.  Wow.  15.  Wow.  Yeah.  And when you got done, was it with people coming up and going, man, I rocked.  You sounded good.  And you're like, that's it.  I'm cooked.  Oh, yeah.  It was girls and everything.  That was, that was awesome.  Yeah.  That was it.  Then I go, that's, I'm sold on the guitar. 
[02:44:00]  Over the years, you play with so many like famous people now from SNL and your show.  Who was like the first one you remember going like, holy shit, I can't believe I'm playing  with this person.  Probably MTV Awards I hosted in James Brown.  I sang with James Brown.  Oh, wow.  That's huge.  Okay.  Pretty legendary.  Yeah.  I asked, I, I, cause I want, we were doing this big whole thing where we're doing impressions  of a bunch of different musicians.  And then at the end I was like, I don't know how to end it.  I'm like, maybe I, like I'm exhausted.  And then you hear like, get up.  And I go, and I go, who's saying that? 
[02:44:30]  And it's like, get up.  And I go, what, what is that?  Who's saying that?  And then he walks in and he goes, get up.  Get up.  You know?  And then everyone goes, so he did that.  Wow.  But you know, just the fact that they got, it was Tom Calderona over at, now he's at  VH1.  But he flew to James Brown's house and he came over and he said, he said, okay, here's the  deal, Jimmy.  When James Brown comes, you can't call him James.  You can't call him Mr. Brown. 
[02:45:00]  You can't call, you have to call him Mr. James Brown.  Or else he'll walk.  Or he's going to walk.  I go, all right, okay.  All right, let me write that down.  I'm freaking out.  I'm like, I don't want to lose this.  This is the end of my whole bit.  This is the one.  So he comes in and everyone's like, he's got his dress room, whatever he wants in his  dress room and all this stuff.  And he walks in.  I go, hello, Mr. James Brown.  He goes, call me James.  Of course.  I go, it's the nicest guy.  And then he was game to do whatever. 
[02:45:30]  He's like, oh, I'll walk out then.  Oh, man.  Do you think that was a publicist overthinking it?  Or was that him, like, probably from years of being treated like shit?  That'd be a great joke to play on people, though.  To make sure that your guy tells everyone, make sure you're calling this.  And just go, nah, call me.  Yeah, I guess it's a great way to.  But it puts you, you're off a little bit, you know, because I was, like, so nervous.  So maybe I guess it's a check, you know, to see if you're going to be respectful or not.  Fast forward.  When you performed with McCartney, you had to be shitting yourself. 
[02:46:00]  Well, here's what happened with this.  This is a true story.  So I go to pre-interview Paul McCartney.  He's going to come on my show, and I'm just excited that he's coming on.  Which, how long before the show do you pre-interview him?  Is it that day or is it, like, a week before?  That day.  Okay.  So that day I go to see him.  He's at Siren Live up in his dressing room.  He's the nicest guy.  And you go in, and he's like, come on in, come on in.  I go, Paul, I go, I'm so psyched that you're going to come on the show.  And I go, I actually wrote a sketch, if you want.  He goes, I think we'll just do, you know, a quick chat.  It'll be a fun chat.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:46:30]  And I go, yeah, okay, that'd be great, too.  I mean, we could do that as well.  I got just questions.  He's like, yeah, let's just have a loose chat.  It'll be fun.  I go, great.  And I go, but I also, we wrote this piece, you know, and he's like, no, you know, we'll  just do a quick chat and we'll have fun, you know.  Oh, man.  It'll be good.  And I go, it's called Scrambled Eggs.  And it's about when you wrote, originally, when you wrote yesterday, you wrote Scrambled  Eggs.  Oh, my lady, how I love your legs.  That was the original.  He goes, I know that.  I wrote it.  And I go, well, just, I have like you singing, like our writer, our writer on the show, Mike 
[02:47:00]  DeCenzo, wrote out the whole song as if you did write the song about Scrambled Eggs.  He's like, okay, just, yeah, just do it.  You know, so I just did it in the dressing room.  So I'm like, Scrambled Eggs, oh, my lady, how I love your legs, but not as much as I  love Scrambled Eggs.  Oh, have you tried Scrambled Eggs?  And then cut to his head is over my shoulder reading the lyrics, like, Waffle Fry.  Oh, and he's laughing.  And I go, oh, cool.  So I go, you're going to do this?  And he goes, oh, only if you do it with me.  Oh, wow. 
[02:47:30]  So I was like, then I just passed out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I didn't go in to pitch him a duet.  Right.  I wouldn't even think to do that.  Tell him all of your shoulders singing in your ear.  It's the craziest thing in the world.  It would be great if you weren't Paul, please.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm unfinished.  Not over my shoulder.  I'm not done.  My point is, you've seen a lot in your career, but I can't imagine you could wrap your head  around that.  It's Paul McCartney.  It's really, it's bizarre.  And of course, when we were trying, rehearsing it, I tried to harmonize. 
[02:48:00]  Right.  And I started to harmonize, and it was awful.  Oh, no.  And he goes, you don't have to do that.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right, you're right.  No.  But then on air, I just, I felt it, and I was like, I think I can do it, and I did it  on air.  Yeah.  And it worked.  Of course it did.  Wow, that's ballsy, though.  Like, on air.  I just felt it.  I felt like it was going to, I was like, we were getting the thing, the crowd was feeding  off the crowd, and it was good, and it was a good take.  And I was like, I know where this is.  I could probably, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I could find this one.  Yeah, yeah, I think I can do this one pretty good.  And so that was just a, it was one of those moments where you go, like, I don't know 
[02:48:30]  if I'm going to realize that this happened now, or in years to come, you know?  That's great, man.  So I think that's kind of when we thought we should put a record out, because, or an  album, not a record, gosh.  A record.  We're going to put a record out.  Some hot wax.  We're getting the band together, and we're getting better for this thing now.  So we started thinking about that.  So then, you know, then it's all, you've got to get clearance and all that stuff.  Yeah.  It takes a lot of time. 
[02:49:00]  We were talking about that, like, it's got to take a while to, a lot of guys.  Yeah, I mean, because we did a slow jam, the news, it's on the record with Brian Williams,  but we, after we did the record, we ended up doing one with the president.  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'd love to have that on the record, but it just, it will take a year to get clear.  Which one will be hard?  The president one?  Brian Williams one will be hard.  Brian, no.  Brian Williams very hard.  You think Obama's a public figure that you could do that, though?  No, I guess not.  No.  You've got to go through some moves.  No, I can't even, yeah, it's tough to even get a photo.  Was it really? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  When you were there?  Oh, really?  It's tough, because it has to come through the White House photographer.  I've got a photo.  Yeah, they don't want a wacky picture of him with his mouth open and sneezing.  Yeah, if you get your cell phone out, you're like, I can probably sneak one of Abe Lincoln's  teacups that he used to use, and as soon as you, there's guys going,  They're on you.  Oh, hey, hey, how you doing?  What do you got there?  Yeah, so it's like, you just feel like you don't belong.  It's like, you don't sneak pictures at the White House.  Oh, so when you had him on the show, though, you got a photo? 
[02:50:00]  I would hope.  Well, yeah, I mean, he eventually sent me, but it took a couple months.  Because it's the White House guy.  It's not like the, it's not your guy.  It's not my guy.  It's the White House guy, and it has to go through their clearances and all that stuff,  and I, you know, you don't tweet about it and all that stuff, which, by the way,  thanks for the tweet.  That was a, the other day.  An accident.  Which one?  I was doing a timeline joke.  Oh, right, right, right.  And I got fouled.  I said the guy right below me really loves anal sex.  Right.  And I tweeted right before. 
[02:50:30]  I tweeted right after.  It was a mistake.  And I go, oh, and I was like, dude, I'm like, I know, I know.  I know, and I go, oh, I know.  It was a dumb timeline joke that you got caught up in.  I know, I was laughing because everyone started sending me, oh, great, well, I'll see you  guys next week.  We'll talk about that.  Great.  Appreciate that.  Yeah.  I love anal.  It was just a dumb timeline joke.  Hey, when you first started the show, it's very difficult to get traction on Late Night  Talk.  I mean, obviously, there have been so many people that have just failed. 
[02:51:00]  When did you start saying like, oh, boy, I think we got this.  I think we're on.  Because you're definitely like, you're one of the players now on Late Night.  You are.  Thank you.  It's a great show.  It's a lot of fun to watch.  When did you know that, like, I think we got something?  I mean.  Were you still worried?  I'm going to say, yeah.  I'm going to say, I don't know.  I think like when I just stopped worrying about time and going to commercial and hitting  all the points.  All the technical stuff was all in your head and not so much of the artistic part of it. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, exactly.  It's having a conversation with what it really is.  And that's what all the advice books say and all the people that you ask tell you.  Just have a conversation.  But you can't just.  It's just weird.  You just can't just do that.  Right.  You know, it's just like, oh, driving a car is easy.  You just press the gas and you go.  But one day.  But then you're driving to a pole.  I don't know.  Yeah.  A pole and you go.  But you're smart though.  I'm sorry.  But you guys like you and Kim will use like the internet and you use Twitter.  Yeah.  You use all this social networking stuff, which makes you relevant to young people.  It's a smart thing to do.  I know. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Because we're on so late.  I think a lot of people see us more on the web even sometimes.  Well, Leno and Letterman don't really capitalize on Twitter.  I don't even know how much Conan does.  Conan's really funny on Twitter, but I don't know how much he uses.  I haven't watched the show how much internet he uses or how much.  Leno just kind of plugs.  But I mean, you know.  I feel like it wouldn't fit them.  You know, just like.  Right.  Right.  It wouldn't make sense.  It's more fun for Letterman to play.  Like, I don't know what this is.  The old curmudgeon iPod.  I don't know what this is.  Wait.  Yeah.  So one day you just relax.  It goes back to me and Anne had a conversation. 
[02:52:30]  We were failing miserably when we first came to New York.  It wasn't happening.  And one day we just talked to each other and said, look, we have nothing to lose now,  man.  You know, because we were worried about intruant records and all that other horseshit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just exactly.  And we had this dumb conversation way home.  Like, we have nothing to lose now.  Let's go in there tomorrow and just fucking talk.  And guess what?  It just.  We hit.  And that was the thing.  That was the first six months.  No one gave a shit about us at all in New York.  Yeah.  I mean, the critics were pretty.  They were pretty good to me.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  Yeah.  They were like, look, it's not awful. 
[02:53:00]  You're like, yes, we're not awful.  Yeah.  I can see with this.  I can see with this.  That being a thing.  But it's not awful.  But we did.  Slow Jam.  The news.  We did our first show.  That was one of our first bits.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And who was it?  Just me.  Oh, it was just you.  Just me and the roots.  And then we tried it with P. Diddy.  And that was fun.  And then Brian Williams came on.  We asked him if he'd do it.  And then we had a whole run with Brian Williams, where he was great. 
[02:53:30]  When you pitched to Obama, when you want to do a bit with the president, you obviously  submitted way before the White House.  Was there anything you wanted to do that they said no to?  Or was this the first idea that, like, sure, it sounds good?  Well, I mean, just knowing from, like, Saturday Night Live, you know, like, where you can push  people and how far and what, is it worth it and all that stuff.  And you don't want to, it's the president.  So I want to be, you know, as classy as you can with that bit.  But I think there was one joke we had, like, I said, POTUS, what does that stand for?  Person of the, like, something like unanimous sexuality or something like that, or sexualness, 
[02:54:00]  or something like that, or unusual sexualness.  And they were just like, yeah, no.  Oh, no, no.  We're not, well, he didn't even get it.  They didn't even wrestle you to the ground.  They didn't wrestle you to the ground, right?  Pull the fucking sheet out of your hand, wrestle to the ground, cuffed.  Yeah, yeah, it was like, well, they didn't even go, no.  No, just don't.  Everything else is good, but just change that.  So we just changed it.  When he comes in day of to perform, I mean, obviously, there's a security lockdown,  only people who need to be there. 
[02:54:30]  But how far in advance does he get there?  Like, or do you go over the bit with him first?  Do you walk into the dressing room or green room?  He has it.  He has it.  And then they have you meet him by yourself at the loading dock.  So I had to meet him.  So I met the president.  And no assistants, no stage manager, no my wife, nobody.  Wow.  So I go, so I go, okay, I meet him by myself.  That's my buddy from college.  Yeah.  They want to do some pictures.  Can you sign some stuff?  So you know what I did?  I printed out a paper that said President Obama written like, you know, the limo drivers 
[02:55:00]  at the airport.  And I just hold it.  I was like, you know, waving at the airport.  I go, how you doing, Mr. President?  I'm Marcus.  I'm your escort.  If you need anything.  He's laughing right after that.  He got the joke.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he went over it and he goes, all right, we're going to slow jam.  And so I showed him my rehearsal.  And then at the end of slow jam, you know, usually Brian Williams says like, he goes like,  oh, yeah.  It's basically just saying the basic news, but in an R&B type of sexual, you know, undertone 
[02:55:30]  to the normal news.  No real hard jokes in there.  Just so at the end, usually Brian Williams goes, oh, yeah.  And so Obama's rehearsing and President Obama's rehearsing and he goes, oh, yeah.  Come on.  Can you give me a little, oh, yeah.  He goes, oh, oh, yeah.  And I go, can you?  No, I'm not going to do that.  I'm not going to do, oh, yeah.  I go, just give me a little spice, can you?  He goes, no, no, no.  You said that to him?  He said no?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little spice.  Yeah, he's a good.  You really have to be on your guard at all times when you're the president. 
[02:56:00]  It's just people are just looking all the time.  And if you loosen up, you're looked at as, what, weak?  I mean, come on.  He didn't, what he could, he didn't, you know, he didn't go over any of the pre-questions.  I didn't know what he was going to say.  Oh, wow.  Like, he didn't even know what he was going to ask, I don't think.  He just, he's just good.  They just trust that you're going to be somewhat respectful.  He's fast enough on his feet.  He's really good.  He's a great, there was a Secret Service guy with crosshairs on your head the whole time.  If he goes into a joke, I got into that, that's where he said, he called them knuckleheads. 
[02:56:30]  Right.  Oh, because it'll happen?  Yeah, he goes, don't let a couple knuckleheads ruin what great service they do for us.  And it was like, I did, you know, he could have easily told me not to ask about that.  Yeah, yeah, true.  He was cool with all that.  In the commercial break, he goes, because at the end of the slow jam, he pulled the microphone  up and just dropped it, like Eminem from 8 Mile.  And I go, and so we're in commercial break, he goes, did you see how I dropped the mic?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw you, it was very funny.  He goes, I improvised that. 
[02:57:00]  You should have scolded him.  Like, that was very inappropriate.  Yeah, I love that he said that, sir.  That's great.  That's pretty cool, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are you talking about during commercial with the President of the United States?  Like, do other people rush over and monopolize him, or is it just you and him sitting there?  We're just sitting there.  He asks you, like, how I met my wife and stuff like that.  And he was really, like, he acted like he was interested in me.  I don't know if he, but he's very presidential, he's very charming.  And he said, I had to meet your wife.  I said, we met in this movie, Fever Pitch. 
[02:57:30]  He produced this movie.  He goes, it was about a guy who loves baseball, but he also loves his girlfriend.  He's not sure which one to choose.  He goes, oh, I remember that movie.  I didn't see it, but I go, I remember that one.  Remember, you chose not to see it?  It was campaign time.  I go, it was not campaign time.  Yeah, that's the worst.  It was that years before you campaigned.  He knows about it, but didn't see it.  That's bad.  That's the worst.  How bad would it be the Tory up for it?  Weak writing, weak acting.  He really criticized the movie. 
[02:58:00]  I'm ready to go watch it next time, yeah.  You're having an argument with him during the commercial break.  Yeah, at least he was honest with me.  Come back from spots, you're yelling at each other.  He's great to everybody.  He's great to every single person on the staff and shook hands and said hello.  And he's just, and they look you right in the eye.  And it's just, it's a powerful moment.  There's something about those.  Gets in the limo, shuts the door.  Glenn, we're out of that fucking place.  Yeah, your microphone's still on.  Bunch of assholes.  Those guys, like Clinton and those guys and all these, anyone elected to that office,  you just know how to own a room. 
[02:58:30]  I mean, like, it's amazing to me the charisma of these guys.  You can't not like one of those guys when you meet them.  It's just charming, yeah, yeah.  It's part of the whole package.  It's part of the politics of it all, yeah.  Have you met Bush or no?  No.  Okay.  We got to get to the album.  Yes.  We haven't even mentioned it yet.  Blow Your Pants Off.  We played a track, History of Rap.  I loved it.  That's a good one.  I didn't see that on the show.  Yeah, that is really fucking cool.  We did with Justin Timberlake.  That costs us a lot of money to get that on the album.  I can imagine.  All the rights, right?  Oh, man.  All the clearances for that.  It was like 15 rap songs from the 80s until now, plus Justin Timberlake doing one of 
[02:59:00]  the voices.  I mean, he's a good sport to do that stuff.  That came about, we were, he was coming on the show and we were going to sing a song  or do some type of Bear Gid bit or something like that.  And he goes, let's switch.  He goes, let's do maybe something like sing our favorite rap songs in a medley.  You know, like, the Humpty dance is your chance.  Do the hump.  And I'm like, and then I just started going like, well, stop what you're doing.  Then we started rapping.  Then I just go like, it takes two to make a thing go right.  Then we just started doing a medley.  And then it was just like, great. 
[02:59:30]  We'll write this up.  This is what we're doing.  So we had writers write it up and we did it on the show and it went, like we said earlier,  it went super viral.  Yeah, it did.  On the web.  It was like crazy viral.  And I was like, whoa, this is cool.  Like, Justin called me from France and he goes, because he was promoting a social network.  He goes, dude, I'm in France and we're on the front page of this French newspaper for  history of rap.  And I'm like, that's crazy.  I'm like, I can't believe like they know who I am in France.  And he goes, no.  No, I'm Justin Timberlake. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, well, whatever.  It doesn't matter.  He doesn't lie to me.  For a second, I felt like, I'm like, oh, they love me.  I'm like Jerry Lewis.  I'm like a big phenomenon in France.  He goes, no.  Now they don't know who you are.  I'm Justin Timberlake.  I was like, whatever.  Whatever.  It sounded really good.  Like the impressions of the guys.  Oh, my God.  The Beasties one was like dead on, man.  I mean, they're my favorites.  Yeah, amazing.  Really, really good.  All the musical stuff we do is because we're fans of the groups and stuff like that. 
[03:00:30]  So it's like, we don't want to ruin the song for anybody, even though if we do, if you  do a parody of it, like if we do Tim Tebow and David Bowie as one human, T Bowie, we don't  want to screw up the song so that every time you hear it, you go, that's, but we just want  to make you laugh and go like, that's a weird combo.  Yeah.  And of course, why didn't we think of that?  Of course, T Bowie is exactly what we should do.  They were playing it in Boston.  I got to the stadium and stuff.  Yeah.  Trying to throw Tebow off. 
[03:01:00]  Nice.  They were playing it.  Oh, man.  It was just crazy.  It was just, it's been, it's the most exciting.  We had a crazy couple years, but especially the last year has just been nuts.  So you're beyond the fear of like losing it all.  Like, you know it's here to stay and you're doing really well and it's not going to just  go away.  Never take it for granted.  Yeah, you never know.  No, but I mean, pride cometh before the fall or something.  Yeah, well, pride going before it cometh.  You guys had it all and then I lost it all.  See what happens?  Thanks for reminding us.  You got it all back?  Oh, you got it all.  Now we have nothing and we're losing that. 
[03:01:30]  We got some of it back, Jimmy.  You're kidding me.  No, you got it.  We're still waiting.  Oh.  What is Roland doing?  We're having a good time with Jimmy Fallon.  You got to go, Jimmy.  He's kidding.  He's kidding.  But he has his guitar and everything.  Oh, man.  I got bits.  I'll do bits.  I'll do bits next time I come back.  You will?  I always do bits.  I love you guys and you guys always do good to me.  The album is called Jimmy Fallon, Blow Your Pants.  We played a song earlier and it's on iTunes or in the store.  Yeah, it's all that stuff.  I don't even know where you buy records anymore.  I know, right?  Really quick.  How's Eddie Vedder?  I'm a big Pearl Jam fan.  Is he got anything on Eddie Vedder? 
[03:02:00]  No dirt on Eddie Vedder.  No, not like that.  Just as a human being.  He's exactly as cool as you want him to be.  He has the flannel thing.  He has the shorts.  He's just cool.  He's a rock star.  Right.  And you meet him, I go, would you like to do the song?  We're doing a protest song about the BP oil spill where we're talking about the tar  balls that are floating up on the beach and the name of the song is Balls in Your Mouth.  Don't swim in the ocean, you'll get balls in your mouth.  And he was like, no thanks.  Appreciate it.  Thank you so much. 
[03:02:30]  No thanks.  I was like, all right, yeah, that's cool.  So then I go, do you just want to just watch rehearsal and then just see what we're doing?  He's like, okay, sure.  He's a great guy, as I said.  So we watched rehearsal.  And I said, here's where I want you to go.  So I go like, balls in your mouth, balls in your mouth.  Don't swim in the ocean, you'll get balls in your mouth.  And I was like, balls in your mouth, balls in your mouth.  Don't swim in the ocean, you'll get balls in your mouth. 
[03:03:00]  And he was like, and if you want, you can just swing around the camera and just give  it a full on to Andy Vedder.  Like, balls in your mouth, balls in your mouth.  Don't swim in the ocean, you'll get balls in your mouth.  And he started laughing.  He was like, oh, I'll do that.  Yeah, so right there, he's like, oh, man.  And then he did it and got to the crowd.  They didn't know that he was going to come out.  Right, right.  Doing my song.  They're like, oh, it's probably just a Jimmy song.  He's going to sing some song with the roots.  And then Eddie came from, it looked like he was a cameraman. 
[03:03:30]  And he flipped from behind the camera and then just sang right into the lens and balls  in your mouth.  And everyone went nuts.  And it was like, oh, it was great.  You're like the guy that has to talk someone into throwing an M80 down the toilet.  And at first, it's like, nah, nah.  It's like, no, dude, it's going to be so much fun.  Everyone flushes a urinal at the same time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're going to break the system.  It's got to be nerve-wracking, though, to have to approach these guys with these ideas.  Like, look, look, you're going to love this. 
[03:04:00]  You got to do it, yeah.  Yeah, that's balls, man.  Well, I just say, honestly, we do it out of love and out of fun.  And we don't want to make anyone look stupid.  Sure, sure.  So when you're done with it, you win.  Right, yeah.  Everyone gets a clear win at the end.  And so that's kind of what I think people see when we do our bits.  Yeah, it just looks like fun, man.  Take care of us, yeah.  Very cool.  Roland is actually literally pissing his pants.  Yeah.  Well, Jimmy's got Blow Your Pants Off, a new album in stores, iTunes, Amazon now. 
[03:04:30]  And Thank You Notes 2 is out, too, right?  That's out, too.  I got a lot of stuff to sell.  And, of course, Jimmy Fallon, one of the best on Twitter.  Yeah.  He's just an animal on Twitter, Jimmy Fallon.  Always a pleasure.  Thank you guys so much.  Thanks so much, man.  So good to see you guys.  Thank you for having me back.  See you last.  Come back and see you soon.  Absolutely.  What are we playing, Iraq?  Balls in your mouth.  You want to do balls in your mouth?  Yeah, let's do that.  Yeah, let's do that.  Blow your pants off.  It's Jimmy Fallon, everyone.  The oil spilled by BP has left tar balls all over the sea. 
[03:05:00]  So don't go swimming down in the south unless you want tar balls in your mouth.  Balls in your mouth.  Balls in your mouth.  Go swim in the ocean.  You'll get balls in your mouth.  Balls in your mouth.  Balls in your mouth.  Go swim in the ocean.  You'll get balls in your mouth.  Balls in your mouth.  Balls in your mouth.

[03:06:30]  Text him.  Serious.  Text him.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Man, I almost got in a brawl in Times Square.  Why?  Last night. 
[03:07:00]  Well.  Your fault, right?  Well, wait a minute.  I'm not sure.  I was just going for a dumb joke.  I don't know.  I guess it might have been your fault.  It can be interpreted.  I guess.  It's all a matter of opinion.  You know?  Well, I did red eye last night.  It's very fun.  Great Gutfeld and the boys.  Nice.  That was a good time.  And when I'm done, I'm catching a cab.  And I already get fucking japped for three cabs. 
[03:07:30]  Literally.  Some Asian people took my fucking cab.  One guy, I went, I'm very good at this one.  And the cab driver was, good, what?  He looks.  And I give him a wave and he goes, he nods.  And from that moment on, that's my fucking cab.  So I'm walking towards it.  And some fucking Asian guy just opens the door and gets in.  And I'm like, you motherfucker.  You know?  And he took off.  So now I'm just pissed. 
[03:08:00]  Happened like two more times where I just got edged out of a cab.  Not so much the other guy being a prick, but it just happens.  So then I'm standing on a corner, waiting.  And the bane of the fucking New Yorker's existence, those pedal cabs are dead.  And they're all over down there.  Yeah, they are.  They're coming around the corner.  You know?  They just fucking pedal around.  They're just circling.  Yeah. 
[03:08:30]  Looking for someone that wants to be on a bike.  Yeah.  And I got my arm up.  I'm looking for a cab.  You know, I'm hailing.  Why didn't you take one of those guys?  Exactly.  No.  Were you going home?  No, no.  But I had to be down to like fucking 15th and 10th.  Okay.  I'm not taking a pedal cab.  No.  Fucking from Times Square to 15th.  So this motherfucker, they keep coming around.  And I'm looking for a cab. 
[03:09:00]  And they keep going, cab?  Taxi?  It's like, you're not a fucking taxi.  You're a glorified big wheel, you fucking asshole.  I'm not going to sit there like an idiot in the back of your dumb fucking tricycle.  I want a...  Gotcha.  So I just kept going.  Like, every time they pass by, I'm like, you want a taxi?  I'm like, yeah, with a motor.  I'm like, I want one with a motor.  Keep going.  Keep moving.  And they just kept asking.  I was just more infuriated because there were no fucking cabs. 
[03:09:30]  Can I stop you for a second?  And why are you scared of the subways?  You know how quickly you would have been downtown in a subway?  It's kind of...  It didn't work out well.  But do you do subways?  Yeah, I do.  Oh, okay.  Believe me.  I got no fear, motherfucker.  No, I'll do subways.  Okay, all right.  The biggest thing with the subway is I don't know where the fucking shit goes and which  train to get and shit.  Go on your iPhone.  I'd be great.  They have a cool subway.  Oh, that sounds like the future, Jimmy.  I'm very scared.  You pop it up.  You go, number one, bingo, bongo. 
[03:10:00]  There it is.  You know exactly where you're going.  Well, you ask somebody, excuse me, where does the train go here?  Doesn't it?  But I don't know.  Never talk to the strangers.  Oh, what the heck?  Everybody helps you.  These pricks were going around.  And so I yell at one guy because I'm just...  I've had it at this point.  Taxi?  I go, no, fuck off.  Oh, shit.  Now, he just...  He fucked off.  He kept pedaling. 
[03:10:30]  But there was another guy behind him.  This Russian guy.  Watch out.  Was he in a hurry?  Yes, he was in a hurry.  In New York City, Russians way scarier than the blacks.  No, not really.  Yes, Ann, I'm telling you.  Yeah, yeah.  Russians are scary, man.  Well, this guy really had, like, no fear.  So he goes...  He gets off of his tricycle, and he's like, 
[03:11:00]  No, fuck you, motherfucker.  Fuck you.  I kick your fucking ass.  And now I got to...  Wait, and you weren't even yelling at him?  No.  I was yelling at the guy in front of him.  Holy shit.  But he took it, like, personally,  because I think I yelled out something like,  Keep pedaling, queer.  Or just something.  Like, I was so angry.  And the Russian guy got really upset.  So he starts trying to get off of his tricycle to come after me. 
[03:11:30]  And now the doorman to one of the hotels sees this whole thing going on,  and he's, like, trying to hold the Russian guy back.  But now I'm there, and I'm so pissed.  I'm like, Fuck off!  And I did that thing where you spread your arms apart.  Like, Come on, motherfucker.  Come on.  And the Russian guy's like,  I kick your fucking ass!  And I'm like, Fuck off!  And the doorman's trying to fucking hold him back.  And there are...  There's a battalion of NYPD in the street. 
[03:12:00]  They're searching trucks.  That's what they do down there now.  They block off part of the road.  They have a lane that's coned off.  And the fucking truck's pulling.  They got the mirrors, the dogs.  So the whole street's lined with cops.  And they turn, and now they're just looking.  They're just looking at this situation unfolding to see if they have to step in.  It was bad, huh?  It was ready to go.  If the doorman wasn't there, it was ready to go. 
[03:12:30]  Would you?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was so fucking pissed.  I take the advice now of people that go,  If you're gonna fight, just immediately start fighting.  Like, the worst thing, when you watch videos of people that get their asses handed to them,  it's always the guy that's standing there going,  Yeah?  Yeah?  Or, well, you know, you wanna do this?  Because you step up and just belt someone in the face.  Then you walk away.  So that's my new school of thought is to fighting. 
[03:13:00]  So I was just gonna, like, if he started coming over to me,  I was just gonna lunge and punch him in the face.  Now let me ask you, did you see all those cops there?  Oh, I saw all the cops there.  So you knew you had a little help.  You knew you could get one good one in.  I could probably get a good one in before.  But it worked against me, too, because, you know,  Sure.  If I'm on the fucking ground, and the cops don't know,  they're gonna take both of us and smash our heads against the fucking wall or something.  Wow.  But I was so fucking angry.  Why were you wound so tight yesterday? 
[03:13:30]  Because I didn't want to deal with the fucking cabs.  That sucked.  And then the little tricycles just asking me every time.  And me having to go, no, no, no.  It just got progressively more angry.  At first I'm like, no thanks, no.  And it ended with, fucking queer!  I was just angry.  So how did this situation end?  Fucking the goddamn Russian got back on his tricycle  and peddled his little ass off down Broadway.  And how much longer for a cab for you? 
[03:14:00]  It was pretty quick after that.  It was pretty fast.  But I still had to fend off a few more of these fucking little bicycle.  Yeah, they're everywhere.  I can't stand the fucking things.  No.  You know what?  If people want to take a ride in one of those,  they will say,  Sir?  Sir, can I have a ride?  If you're hailing a cab,  you want a metal one from this goddamn century.  It's not Japan!  You rickshaw motherfuckers! 
[03:14:30]  So you were going to scrap last night.  It was the closest I've ever come to scrapping in,  I mean, in fucking my adult life.  Were you worried?  Not at all.  I was like, I was psyched.  I was kind of psyched about it.  Were you going to use these?  Yeah.  Or this?  No, no.  You can't do that.  These?  I was just going to belt them in the face really hard.  I don't know what I'm saying out there.  Really hard.  Maybe you're a kickboxer.  But those Russians, they're crazy.  Why don't you go with an illegal?  I go with the illegals.  What do you mean?  The black cars that stop and go, hey. 
[03:15:00]  I try, but with all those cops there,  they were very leery about stopping.  Those guys are way nicer than the cabbies.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  I would grab one of those up in a second.  The illegals are basically guys that are hired  to bring some dummy into the city,  and then they've got hours to kill,  so they try to make a little side money.  Yeah.  And they'll pull up to you and ask you where you're going and stuff.  And they look a bit shady at times, sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But in general, they're great guys.  But in Times Square, you just couldn't flag one of those down. 
[03:15:30]  They kind of frown on that.  And how they rape us with the cab fares and stuff,  I don't feel guilty at all.  No.  At all.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a close one.  I was amazed that the Russian actually got so upset  that I called the other guy and told him to fuck off.  Well, he...  Fuck off.  I tell you to fuck off.  Because it hit too close to home.  He knows that it's a shitty job.  You know, he's from Russia.  He came over here, and he's hoping to make it big.  When I was in Russia, I was a nuclear engineer. 
[03:16:00]  Now I peddled motherfucker around Times Square.  Fuck this job.  Dude, I know I'm going to scrap in the playground eventually  with this kid shit.  I sure have.  It's different, Uncle Paul.  You see the Russian fathers?  Holy fuck.  They are intimidating, man.  Yeah, they're all like that fucking...  I can use some of my psychological shit with people.  Those Russians, man.  I can't figure them out.  I can't figure a way in yet psychologically.  They are scary in general. 
[03:16:30]  They're very cold people.  I am stereotyping, obviously.  They're cold.  Holy fuck.  They're not typically...  That's why Yakov Smirnoff was such an anomaly.  He was a funny Russian.  Ha ha.  And of course, the magnetic dinner tray.  But you know what I mean?  They're not known as fun guys.  That would have been ironic if I had a magnetic dinner tray and smashed that Russian in the face with it.  A lot of people are asking if it was a stand your ground type situation last night.  There is no stand your ground in New York State.  Yeah. 
[03:17:00]  So, no, it wasn't a stand your ground situation.  It was no...  There was no fucking need or any indication there would be a need for the use of deadly physical force.  It looked like it was going to be a little brawl.  Just a few fisticuffs thrown, but never got to that point.  All right.  People are worried that you're fist fighting.  No, I didn't.  I was just saying...  You came close, though.  That, yeah, I didn't...  Yeah.  Sirius XM. 
[03:17:30]  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Right.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  How great was Jimmy Fallon?  It was amazing.  I was thinking about this morning when I woke up.  When we were doing this show, not after Opie and Anthony Live, but when we were doing Opie and Anthony,  back when we were on K-Rock, it was when Jimmy Fallon... 
[03:18:00]  It was way before the talk show, but it was quite a bit after SNL.  It was in that, you know, kind of weird sort of in-between time where he wasn't doing that much.  And he came by, and he was promoting Car Wash for Peace.  And he was promoting his first CD, too.  And that was just a CD, though.  Yeah.  Like, he was just like...  Because he didn't...  He was just like...  He was trying to see what was happening.  So he put out a comedy CD, and he put out his charity song, and he was just like, whatever. 
[03:18:30]  I'm just seeing what's going on.  And then, all of a sudden, he becomes a talk show host.  So he comes in again, like, when the talk show is still new.  And, you know, he's got his new show jitters or whatever, but he's just as cool as he always was.  He comes in today, and he's an established talk show guy.  Like Ant said, he's one of the players now.  Like, he and Jimmy Kimmel...  Do you think...  Eric, you're a late-night talk show junkie. 
[03:19:00]  I kind of feel like Jimmy Fallon is a bigger talk show host than Craig Ferguson.  Yeah, in different demos, but yeah.  Like, in terms of, like, just kind of national awareness, getting yourself out there.  Like, Craig Ferguson is another guy who has not done much on the internet.  And him being on at 1230, that doesn't do him any favors.  No, but a lot of his monologues and conversations that he has with guests do make the internet. 
[03:19:30]  He doesn't do internet pieces.  Yeah, I don't think Craig Ferguson...  I don't really mean in terms of just ratings, but I mean in terms of the national conscience.  Conscience.  Recognition.  Buzz.  Yeah.  I think Jimmy Fallon is definitely a more...  To younger people and to an internet audience, Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel.  And that's all that counts anyway, isn't it?  Right now, pretty much, yeah.  You know, that's what people pay attention to.  Leno and Letterman can do whatever they want because they're fixtures at 1130.  They're established.  Yeah, nobody's going to do anything different at that time. 
[03:20:00]  They're royalty!  Yeah.  Yeah, and I mean, but what's amazing is that he comes in here and he's this guy now.  Like, he's the legit...  Like, he's looked at seriously as possibly and probably the next guy to host The Tonight Show is what people say.  Well, if they still do that.  But, like, who knows?  When Leno decides to leave, they may just come up with something different.  Just kill The Tonight Show altogether.  They may just, you know...  Would that break your heart?  You're...  Like, Eric, for those that don't know, E-Rock is like a Tonight Show, late night talk show junkie. 
[03:20:30]  The Tonight Show was never really my thing, though.  But, no, I mean in general.  The Tonight Show is...  It's an institution.  Right.  Yeah.  And Eric actually wanted...  His dream job was not a wrestler, like people think.  It wasn't...  No one thinks that.  He was a Hulkamaniac.  People think that, because you're a Hulkamaniac.  No, you think that.  I'm pretty sure it was true at one point.  But...  No.  His dream job was always to be Letterman.  Is that right?  Yeah.  For a while, I really wanted to do that late night talk show kind of thing. 
[03:21:00]  Right.  So, I mean...  So, it wouldn't...  It wouldn't...  You don't think it would be a bad to the tradition and to the...  Whatever it is to do away with The Tonight Show altogether?  No.  The Tonight Show, I don't think, will work with a new host.  And I'm not saying because, you know, Conan took it and then it got tainted or whatever,  how people view it.  I just think when Leno goes to retire and if they move Fallon up, I don't think The Tonight 
[03:21:30]  Show really fits with what Jimmy does anymore.  Well, it didn't fit with what Conan did either.  No.  And they still gave it to him.  I mean, they would have him...  But that was a contractual kind of thing.  Like, the guy...  And they fucked things up royally, didn't they?  They fucked it up.  I think the name will stay with Leno.  Leno, but when Leno's done, I think 11.30 will become something else.  Interesting.  Interesting.  But so, Jimmy Fallon comes on and he's as cool as he always was.  Yeah.  Like, he's not at all... 
[03:22:00]  You know, you get nervous because when guys who came in were cool and then they get all  kinds of more famous...  Like, Jimmy Fallon was already a famous guy when he came in here, but he's way more famous  now, he's got way more eyes on him, and he's got way more people paying attention to every  move he makes.  And a lot of times, people come in here and things have changed in that direction, and  they're different because they're watching what they say, and they don't want to be a  part of anything too crazy, and, you know, they kind of want to remove themselves a little 
[03:22:30]  bit from things that they were a lot more comfortable with when they were first kind of breaking  in.  But Jimmy is like, he's completely comfortable with what's going on, he's completely comfortable  in the studio, and, I mean, how many of these talk show hosts will come in and tell us behind  the scenes stories about their high-profile guests?  Like, not only...  I'm sure Kimmel would if Kimmel came on the show.  But Kimmel's not like a...  Like, Fallon's only been doing this for, what, three years? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, three years, 2009.  And Kimmel, I feel like, is more of a guy who's been whipped around by show business  a little bit, who never really...  Like, when he started doing his show, I don't think he gave a fuck, he was just doing what  he does.  They had a bar.  They had a bar in the green room and off to the side of the stage.  They were drinking.  Whereas Jimmy Fallon was more like, okay, we gotta get this thing right.  Yeah.  Jimmy Kimmel was just like, fuck it, I'm doing what I do.  And at first, Jimmy Fallon was like, alright, let me make sure I get this thing right.  And now he's coming in, and how great were his behind-the-scenes Obama stories? 
[03:23:30]  He's telling us what it was like to convince Paul McCartney to do the bit, Eddie Vedder  to do the bit.  Everyone loves hearing a story, especially when it comes to a president or, like, a king.  The highest profile guest you could have.  No matter what happened, the smallest incident, everyone loves hearing a story about who interacted  with somebody at that level.  I really like the story that Jimmy told, that Obama was proud of himself for improv-ing  the mic drop-ing.  I like the fact that he stood at the loading dock with a sign like he was a limo driver 
[03:24:00]  and just waiting for the president.  Yeah, yeah.  But yeah, it was also really cool hearing that, because you watch Fallon's show, because  I think Fallon's trademark is kind of getting pretty big names to do pretty weird stuff with  him.  Like, guys that you wouldn't expect to do skits or whatever to end up doing stuff, like  Springsteen, like McCartney, like Eddie Vedder.  And I like hearing his stories because you find out that, yeah, they did turn him down 
[03:24:30]  at first.  Like, it's not like he just goes up to these people and they're like, yeah, we'll do it.  Like, every time, it seems like they say, yeah, no, I don't think I'm going to do that.  And he has to sell it.  He mentioned, I think, one, maybe two examples about what was pitched to the White House and  the president's people about what would be acceptable and what wasn't for him to come  in and perform.  Not even the stuff that made it to his assistants turn down, but I'm curious to see what they 
[03:25:00]  came up with in the writers' room and then said, there's no way we could even ask the  president that.  Yeah, like some of the writers were just coming up and stuff.  Like, what did Fallon have to turn down from his writers and be like, no, we're not going  to do that.  There's no way we could even send that to them.  No, we're not going to do that.  Like Fallon said, there was the one thing that they really had to cut out was a sexual reference  to POTUS, you know, president of the United States.  Sexiness or something like that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if you want it, but the last time, or back at K-Rock, I guess, when Fallon 
[03:25:30]  was in, he did two songs.  What did he do?  What songs?  You Spit When You Talk.  It's on the album.  Oh, that's right.  It is on the new album.  And this one I don't think is a lot.  Car Watch for Peace.  Did he perform that live or did he just bring it in to play?  He may have also performed it live.  I don't know.  Hold on to him just in case we want.  Maybe we'll do him in a little bit.  But, yeah, and you can put this on for a second, Sal.  We'll listen to a little bit of this.  He's jumping on the bandwagon.  He picked up on the Carly Rae Jepsen thing. 
[03:26:00]  He had Carly Rae Jepsen on his show.  This is it.  Tim and the Roots.  Yeah, and he had her and the Roots playing high school instruments.  Or not high school, but, you know, school classroom instruments.  I think you guys remember this song.  You remember that one?  By the way, Fallon has 2.6 million views on this. 
[03:26:30]  And it was from four days ago.  It's just one request.  If everybody could just do me a favor and never fucking doubt me again, I would appreciate it. 
[03:27:00]  Okay?  Why is that?  Because I was fucking right like I always am.  And this is the song of the summer.  And Troy came in here.  And he said, Sam, this is going to be the song of the summer.  And I said, I don't know, Troy.  Why don't you let me hear it?  You think this over that Carmen song?  Yes, this over the Carmen song.  The Carmen song has no traction.  Okay.  It's got nothing going on for it.  Look at this.  The Jimmy Fallon version has 2.6 million views. 
[03:27:30]  There's not a bunch of Opie and Anthony fans tweeting Carmen.  No.  But they're tweeting Carly Rae.  Troy came in here and he said, Sam, I'm telling you, this song is a big deal.  And you're going to want to get on this bandwagon now.  And I said, Troy, I don't know.  I'm not ready to jump in yet. 
[03:28:00]  Let me hear the song.  And Troy was like, all right, let's put it on.  We put it on.  And I told you all.  I said, Troy's right.  This is the next shit.  And then I insisted on playing it another 17 times in a row.  The song is massive.  It's huge, dude.  Massive.  And you know what I find out?  First of all, Eric, you're the late night expert.  What city is Jimmy Fallon taped in?  New York City.  New York City.  Across the street from our building.  Which of these goddamn talent bookers around here was asleep at the wheel and didn't get 
[03:28:30]  Carly Rae Jepsen on After Open Anthony Live when she was obviously in town?  I'm just glad to say because she's going to be untouchable.  Listen, she's going to be untouchable and then she's going to be very touchable.  It's not like she has a plethora of hits in her.  At this moment, she's untouchable.  Jimmy Fallon got to touch her.  Look at those shoulders rubbing.  I got her in September.  Well, I'm not worried about a picture.  Nobody's going to care about a picture.  I told you then. 
[03:29:00]  I said, you should do a one question with her.  And you're like, nah, that's cool.  I don't give a fuck about a one question either.  It doesn't matter until it's something here.  Well, wouldn't it be nice to have one in the can?  I would go just in case.  No.  Where I want is a simple conversation with Carly Rae Jepsen.  So she realizes that we at After Open Anthony Live were on her shit before all these other  fucking jokers.  Broke that shit.  Broke it.  And called out hits one and been like, yo, you motherfuckers  are asleep at the wheel.  And guess what happened?  Then they started playing it. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Then they started playing it.  And then Piff wants to take credit for that?  Fuck Piff.  Yeah, Piff, I would say.  Now, we've been playing it.  It just wasn't in a heavy rotation.  Well, that's the point.  The point is that it wasn't in heavy rotation.  You can play anything you want, but if you play it once a week on a channel that plays  20 songs, nobody's going to notice it until After Open Anthony Live plays it 17 times in  a row.  I'm still getting random tweets from people.  Me too.  They're just like, hey, just heard Carly Rae Jepsen in a bar.  What's up, Sam?  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:30:00]  You know?  And then, so, number one, I want to find out which of these talent bookers was snoozing  when she was in town.  Because like I said, I'm not interested in a picture.  I need to do one question.  I want to have a conversation with Carly Rae Jepsen on After Open Anthony Live and let  her know how much this show has influenced her career and how much money this show has 
[03:30:30]  brought her and if I can have some of it.  Right.  Some.  Not all her money in general, but just if we could figure out, because I know how many  people on Twitter tweeted me with screen grabs from their phone or their iPod or whatever  that said, look what I just downloaded.  That's $1.29 a song on iTunes.  Exactly.  Okay?  Yeah, thanks to this show.  Thanks to this show.  Okay?  So maybe if you could do me a favor and share some of that money.  Now, Carly Rae Jepsen is tweeting that she's in France. 
[03:31:00]  Well, it's going to be a little fucking difficult to get her here if she's in France, isn't it?  Yeah.  But she was just on Jimmy Fallon.  Yeah, so she was in town.  She was in town.  Why didn't they make this happen?  Who was snoozing?  Who was in siesta mode when Carly Rae Jepsen was around here when we've been on this shit?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  She owes us at least a nice thank you.  And then at least a nice thank you and maybe a little envelope with some money in it.  I mean, I'll take a thank you and lunch.  But like a nice lunch, not fast food.  No.  Like, go down to Del Frisco's or something. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Because she's got it.  Of course she's got it.  At this point, she's got it.  Yeah, she's taken care of.  But then I find out from Liam yesterday.  He goes, you know, one of the NFL shows is asking for Carly Rae Jepsen.  And I go, what are you talking about?  Tell me to get off my shit.  Like, I don't need a whole bunch of people trying to, like, let me handle this.  Yeah, they're cop-blocking you.  Exactly.  Let me handle this for Sirius XM, okay?  Yeah.  I kicked Mikey Piff and Hits One out of the way because it's documented that we were on  this shit before Hits One. 
[03:32:00]  And I talked to him at your wedding.  He still thinks he's the one that did it.  Well, tell him to come in here anytime he wants.  And I'll take his round little head and shove it up his ass.  Okay?  Because that's the truth.  And this, on this show, after Open Anthony Live, all we do is speak honestly.  That's right.  And that's the truth.  Now, Liam is saying that some NFL channel wants to get all involved because they're like,  no, no, no, you don't understand.  Carly Rae Jepsen, that we play it every day.  That's our song. 
[03:32:30]  And I'm like, Liam, let them know that I did that shit months ago, okay?  It's over.  Look at the tapes.  Look at the tape of the tapes.  And then, wait till you hear this.  Steve Sterniolo, welcome to the show, DJ Who Kid.  Wait till you hear this.  Steve Sterniolo, who's one of the guys who works over at Raw Dog, I guess he was hosting  Comedy by Request, which is a show that I'm going to be hosting tomorrow and Friday.  He's hosting that show.  And he goes, hey, just wanted to let you know, I gave you a shout out on Comedy by Request. 
[03:33:00]  And I said, oh, what'd you do?  And he said, well, I played Carly Rae Jepsen a whole bunch of times, and I said that you  did it.  And I said, Steve, if you go into a bank and let them know you're robbing them, you're  still robbing them.  Yeah.  Just because you mentioned my name doesn't mean you didn't steal my shit.  Yeah.  Like, I already did it.  Yeah.  Like, you know why I was, just to direct them to my show.  Don't do it on your show.  Yeah.  Just say, hey, you want a funny show?  Turn the channel.  Don't get little props, though. 
[03:33:30]  You gotta be happy about that, right?  No.  No?  No.  Like I said, if you got, like, Troy, I stole your money.  But thanks for the money.  Does that make you feel good?  No.  No, because why?  Because you don't have any cash.  Right.  Or it's like Dr. Ian told Eric, you stole 500.  And he took the 500.  Well, Dr. Ian was just trying to get his money back from Eric.  Oh, my bad.  My bad.  Thought that because time passes, he can welch on bets.  He's so angry.  What happened, though?  What happens here...  I've never seen you angry, ever. 
[03:34:00]  Well, the problem is that people, I mean, the fans realize...  People are taking credit for shit that belongs from this show.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  You know Carla Rae Jepsen, Call Me Maybe?  You're a DJ.  You should know this.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay?  Troy and me, we broke that shit on this show, okay?  Nobody was on that shit.  Yeah, we were way ahead of the game on this one.  Like super, like, super, like, fall away before.  Yeah, like, this was, like, April when we did this, okay?  I was playing this song in clubs, and nobody would react except three girls who lost their 
[03:34:30]  fucking minds.  Three girls!  And I'm like...  And then I'd go to another place, and it'd be, like, five girls that are just losing their  minds to the song.  I was like, this song is gonna fucking do something.  Yeah.  Now it's funny.  I play that shit.  Guys.  Guys.  The last time I played, guys were on the couch screaming every word.  Dude.  They're wiggling now?  They're wiggling.  What?  The men are wiggling.  Get out of here.  We did it.  We put it on at my wedding.  The dance floor filled up.  Everyone crazy.  Everybody.  Get out of here.  Put it on at her wedding.  Everybody went crazy.  But nobody wants to recognize what's happening. 
[03:35:00]  And I'm saying who, kid.  Like, she did this great video with Jimmy Fallon.  Wow.  Love it.  You know what I mean?  Jimmy Fallon's doing his thing.  Yeah.  But, Jimmy Fallon...  It was on Friday.  Jimmy Fallon tapes his show in New York.  Yeah.  What the fuck wasn't she up here while she was in town?  Oh, that's rude.  Right?  Who's sleeping?  Yeah.  Which of these bookers is sleeping that's not gonna direct her to After Open Anthony Live?  That is rude.  You understand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's some bitch-ass movie.  I'm sure you have broken several rappers.  Yeah, yeah.  And by broken, I mean ripped off their shit.  Yeah, and then they blow up. 
[03:35:30]  You don't even see them again.  Faggots.  Listen, how about this one?  How about, I remember a rapper named Nicki Minaj, except when I saw her, she was in  just regular, a black weave and a baseball cap and blue jeans coming on DJ Who Kids show.  And I used to say she was like the worst rapper alive.  Right.  And this was even before you and I started listening to her.  Was it before a mixtape?  Yeah.  And then she switched her style, and she came back on my show to curse me out.  But she gave me the respect that I told her that she was whack.  Right. 
[03:36:00]  So she switched her shit.  But her problem is her middlemen, because they don't want her to be...  Hip-hop?  They just want her to be straight pop.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  But see, you understand what I'm dealing with.  Yeah, you just got to like get a gun like we do and just...  Just start shooting people.  Just start shooting people.  Okay, let them know you're serious.  Get all the hood up in here.  Okay, thank you again.  Maybe, Troy, you didn't say...  Why didn't you suggest that to me?  No, we need to start getting more aggressive.  He is right.  Sorry for being ignorant.  I'm sorry.  By the way, yesterday on the show, we were watching some Hood Life YouTube videos.  Oh, wow.  And Opie and Anthony are looking to bring a thug on the air. 
[03:36:30]  Get out of here.  And we discussed this a little in our actually in our staff meeting yesterday.  Seriously?  And we were wondering if you knew Ev any thugs.  I know a lot of thugs.  You do?  What?  Now, I'm not talking about like Youngberg who was assaulted by thugs.  Yeah.  Like I'm talking about...  I'm talking about...  You want like some real like street dudes.  Right.  I guess I'll go to Harlem or Brooklyn.  I'll find somebody.  Like thugs that you would describe as grimy ass thugs.  Yeah.  Something like that.  You want me to call somebody now?  Can you hook that up?  Yeah.  Can you get them on O&A and talk about, you know, Hood Life? 
[03:37:00]  Definitely.  Bring some Hood Rats up while you're at it.  Oh, Ratchets.  They call them Ratchets now.  Yeah?  Is that Hood Rats or Ratchets now?  Yeah, Ratchets.  Okay.  Let me talk to some of these people.  Dang, I was a little angry today.  I thought he was fired up.  I get all fired up at that point.  Underarm is sweating too.  Is that right?  No.  John in Connecticut.  God.  Hey, have you heard the NPR version of the song?  NPR is doing it.  By the way, when Terry Gross is doing it, you know that there is a limited shelf life on 
[03:37:30]  this thing.  I have not heard the NPR version, but I would like to.  Thank you, John.  You're welcome.  How long, Troy, do you think the song has left?  Will it make it to September?  No.  No.  People will be burned out by next month.  Because it's just everywhere.  Okay, so July.  It makes it to July 4th weekend, I think.  And this song is so massive, that's like, what do you do for a follow-up?  You go home.  You save your money, you start investing.  But there's a lot of times, like, look at Katy Perry. 
[03:38:00]  You know, she came out with, I Kissed a Girl, and everybody's like, oh, I love this song,  I love this song.  And it's like, there's no way she has another one in her.  And then she just keeps firing out hit after hit.  But you know what?  I Kissed a Girl was like, it sounded different than a lot of pop songs.  And Katy Perry has a pretty different sound than pop artists.  There's nothing different about what Carly Rae Jepsen's doing.  She just tapped into it.  No, that's just a well-written song.  It's good.  Yeah.  Listen, she's also, she doesn't, like, you can't tell in the YouTube videos and stuff,  the chick's 27 years old. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  She doesn't have a long pop life.  Three more years, maybe.  This'll jumpstart something if she's smart.  If she's smart.  She better launch a record label or do whatever rappers do when they're finished,  because she's got to get something going on.  Yeah, but Katy Perry showed her boobs on Sesame Street, so maybe if she...  Maybe that's what she needs to do.  Maybe that, she needs to get attention.  You like that?  I missed, I gotta say that.  My kid had a boner.  I was like, what do you do?  Well, first of all, your kid's, like, 13 years old.  What's he doing watching Sesame Street?  I mean, wasn't that, like, last year? 
[03:39:00]  He's 12, man.  I'll be watching Sesame Street.  They're showing titties.  Okay, that's fair.  Matt in Pennsylvania.  Wow, I love...  Oh, there it is right there.  Wow.  God damn it.  Just because she's wearing an Elmo shirt doesn't mean she's on.  Wouldn't you have a 12-year-old on the boner with that?  Of course.  She's not on Sesame Street there.  She's just wearing an Elmo shirt.  You should see what I was jerking off to when I was 12.  Matt, what's up?  Hi, Sam.  I want to say you're full of malarkey.  You did not bring Kylie Rae Jepsen to the masses.  Yes, you did.  Ooh.  And a few days later, she was on The View. 
[03:39:30]  And about a week later, because I am a listener to the After Show, then you brought her to our attention.  Yeah, but guess what?  Justin Bieber didn't have the power.  The View didn't have the power.  Nope.  Because I wasn't getting tweets about her when she was on The View or when she was on Justin Bieber.  And Troy said it himself.  He was in the club, DJing, mixing, and there'd be three girls dancing.  And Troy, after the exposure on After Open Anthony Live.  Then it was just a massive explosion.  Matt, do you see what?  Now there's dudes standing on couches singing that goddamn song. 
[03:40:00]  Wiggling, wiggling.  Wiggling.  The guys wiggle.  That's what they do.  I'm not saying that this was the first show to play Carly Rae Jepsen.  What I am saying is...  They broke her.  We broke her, and we're the first show that mattered.  Yeah.  Like, we're the first...  You want to shut her down now?  Well, I don't want to shut her down.  I wish her all was success in the world.  Oh, okay.  I just wish somebody would let her know that a couple bucks thrown this way would be nice.  You know what I mean?  We made her a lot of money.  Because a lot of people...  We like some of that.  A lot of people put both you and I on tweets together. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  Saying, like, oh, I said...  And then I love when they include her on it.  Yeah, me too.  So it's like...  She's got to know.  We need to let Carly Rae Jepsen know that Not Sam and Troy Kwan are the ones that broke you.  Yeah.  You see multiple, and so it's obviously she's seeing them.  She's got to.  Yeah.  Unless she's not in touch with her fan base, which I would hope that she is.  Right.  Because they're the ones...  They're the ones and we're the ones making all that money.  And like I said, Carly, you know...  Again, we just want to say hello and have a pleasant conversation with you.  But if you brought your checkbook, that wouldn't hurt either because it'd be nice. 
[03:41:00]  That's why I accept, like, you know, a little gift before I place somebody's record on it.  You do.  You accept it.  What kind of little gifts?  They're hot.  What are some of the gifts that you've gotten?  They're extra hot.  Yeah.  Oh, is that what that means?  That's what it's called for?  Extra, extra, extra hot means it's a $10,000 gift.  So maybe I'm a sucker.  Like, I put Carly Rae Jepsen in, like, rotation, rotation.  Like, I played her song, like, 17 times in a row on this show.  You didn't even get a dick sucking then?  Nothing.  Damn.  I'd love to get a dick sucking for playing somebody's song.  Wouldn't that be great? 
[03:41:30]  That would be great.  Are you not there yet, DJing?  No.  Oh.  Unfortunately.  How long does Troy have, who kid, before he can get a nice dick sucking for playing?  Well, you're talking about on the radio or you're talking about DJing live?  I mean, you beat her, get the dick sucked, then play it the next day.  Maybe a handjob for live.  Yeah.  And then a blowjob for the radio.  It's just more people listening.  That's a little prerequisite right there.  Something like that.  Yeah.  How long do you think Troy has before he's got enough exposure where he can at least get  a handjob for playing a record?  I don't know.  Like another month or two.  Yeah.  Great place.  Give me some hope.  Have you, we discussed what you could do in the clubs and what you could do to gain 
[03:42:00]  attention and who kid at one point.  I had a girl lick my ass.  You did?  For the spin.  How was her song?  It was horrible.  It was not good.  I didn't lick the ass though, man.  Who kid's no joke, man.  I follow him on Instagram.  I love these pictures.  Some of my favorites.  It's DJ who kid on Instagram and Twitter.  Like ridiculous.  I need to be hanging out with you, dude.  Please, let me open up for you somewhere.  I don't give a fuck.  Have you tried jerking off in a club before a performance like DJ who kid once suggested?  No.  You haven't?  No. 
[03:42:30]  Have you thought?  I mean.  I mean.  You know, I'll do anything at this point.  You know what I mean?  Like I'm just trying to get ahead.  Just trying to get my name out there.  Get ahead.  Yeah, I gotcha.  I gotcha.  Yeah.  And if you can get ahead, if you can play a record, you know.  Maybe I'm going to kidnap him to rehab in Vegas.  Would you?  I saw you're out there.  That's fucking insane.  Would you take Troy to open for you?  Oh, yeah.  No problem.  You got to just play all the.  I mean, it's white people.  Yeah.  I know what the white people like.  I mean, I'm in tune with the white people.  I would think so.  I don't think there's a lot of black people no more.  Why not?  I don't know.  It's too urban for me, you know.  You don't feel safe. 
[03:43:00]  No, I don't feel safe.  You don't feel safe in the environment.  I don't have a blue vest on.  I gotcha.  I don't have time for that shit.  Let me ask you this, who, kid.  What did you.  You're.  You work for 50 Cent.  He's your boss.  Yeah.  What did you think of his one on one with Oprah?  I know.  That was kind of weird.  That was crazy.  He was wearing like a purple sweater and he was hashing out the beef with Oprah.  I mean, you got to be.  You know, you got to connect with the white people.  You can't be like, you know, that's the Kanye West thing.  Like, you can't be.  Yeah, but then you go too white, though.  Then the hood doesn't respect you anymore, right?  No, but he's with Oprah.  The hood don't respect her either.  No. 
[03:43:30]  Is this 50.  Is he getting like.  Is he getting his politician on?  Is he, you know.  It's been a long time coming because he's been telling Oprah to suck his dick for like  the whole two years.  Has she ever?  She doesn't suck his dick.  Okay.  You know, because she likes girls.  Oh, she does.  Yeah.  But I had no idea.  I didn't know.  I seen it on air.  Yeah, you did.  I had no idea.  Speaking of saying stuff on air, I wanted to say this.  Let's talk for a second about Steven Singer.  I don't know if you realize this, who, kid.  You see this?  Yeah.  What happened, yo?  I'm married now.  Oh, I thought you were showing me the bit finger or something. 
[03:44:00]  No, no.  That's a ring on my finger.  I got some stink on my finger.  Look.  Damn, your dick is in your pocket now.  No, the past few months, you've heard that Steven Singer is the best place to go to buy  your gifts.  You've heard about his brand new super silver argentium with diamonds.  Oh, get out of here.  And don't forget about his popular black diamonds.  Who, kid.  You ever buy any of those black diamonds?  Soldier Boy did.  I don't know.  That shit ain't real, though.  But what I think Steven Singer's are. 
[03:44:30]  I don't know what Soldier Boy's got.  Okay.  But what you haven't had the opportunity to be reminded of often enough is that Steven  Singer is the best place to buy your diamonds in America.  Who, kid.  They love diamonds in hip hop.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's right.  They're jewelers, right?  Steven Singer jewelers.  Jewelers is what they are.  Jewelers.  Oh, man.  It's absolutely the only place to go for your engagement ring.  Oh, wow.  I just got married in my Steven Singer rings.  Okay.  See that gold ring on my finger?  That's hot, man.  Steven Singer.  Steven made it so easy. 
[03:45:00]  He has the largest selection of loose certified diamonds and an inventory of over 3,000 settings  for you to choose from.  His guarantee and warranty is absolutely unrivaled by the competition.  100% full money back guarantee.  It's true.  Get out of here.  Yeah.  It's risk free shopping.  Get out of here.  You don't have to rob him.  Duh.  So, when it's time for the ring, don't forget this piece of advice.  Go see Steven Singer.  You can see him in Philly at the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  You can call him up on the phone at 888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER or online at IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.COM. 
[03:45:30]  Does he give, like, niggas a discount?  I don't know if he does that.  You know black people always wear a discount, right?  I've heard.  Black people, they pay.  Like, that's the price.  All right.  Sal, when you cut this live read up, make sure you include a DJ Who Kid request for a discount  for niggas.  Make sure you throw that in.  Let me say that.  Okay.  Okay.  Because he loved the gold dip roses when Who Kid asked for...  You better have some cubics over there.  Because, you know, that's the hip-hop shit right there. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  Everybody got fake shit on there.  Is that right?  Come on, man.  Steven Singer, maybe you should consider a hip-hop collection where it is.  It's all cubics and glass and...  I'll definitely look into it because I think I'm going to marry a new bitch in Thailand.  I may have to...  Is that right?  You are a married man.  Yeah.  I'm already married, but I might marry another bitch in Thailand.  Is that right?  Yeah.  I mean...  Wow.  Okay.  Well...  Get your bitch fucking with your other bitch.  Nah, I don't want that.  No, no, no.  Well, you don't want...  Fuck my bitch, man.  Yeah.  Well, you don't.  Do you?  Nah, I don't fuck her.  No. 
[03:46:30]  I didn't think so.  I'd give it a finger.  Just a little bit.  Just enough to suffice and just, all right, I'm out of here again.  You got long fingers, too.  Well, I mean, are you flirting with me or...  I mean, nah.  I'm just saying, like...  I wanted, though, real quick, because I'm sitting in the office yesterday, and Stinky,  a.k.a.  Garrett, comes up to me, and I thought that everything about my wedding had been talked  about when we were finished.  Yeah.  I was gone last week.  I was in Bermuda.  Oh, wow.  And so I missed a lot of shows.  Ooh.  And I was leaving it to Eric to fill me in on what I missed. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  And he told me all about Amy Schumer telling us the story of her getting fingered by a cabbie.  What?  And I enjoyed hearing about that.  That's hot.  But am I to believe that I missed a story?  Did Eric shat himself at my wedding?  Nah, he did not.  Did you shit yourself?  No way.  No.  Okay, tell me what I missed, then.  What's the shit yourself story?  Because Garrett comes in, and he goes, did they tell you that Eric shit himself at your  wedding?  I go, what?  No way. 
[03:47:30]  I would have told you that.  That's what I thought.  No, it was after the bar closed and everything at the hotel.  After the after party.  I thought that's the hotel lobby.  The tavern, as it was called.  How did you eat?  What happened?  Yeah, so you shat...  Now, you were very fucked up on alcohol at the time.  Yeah.  Plus that breakfast buffet.  The breakfast buffet.  Oh, forget about it.  You tried to smoke a little weed, but I've heard from now multiple people that you didn't  really inhale much.  Obama did.  Don't ask me to do it anymore. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  Um, but you still were very fucked up.  And you were fucked up on alcohol and bacon and syrup.  So what?  Yeah.  So what happened?  So, uh, went to bed and at some point I thought, like, I was going to throw up.  So I got up a couple times and thought I was going to throw up and nothing happened.  What were you, throwing up from the alcohol and the syrup?  I don't know.  Okay.  But I went back to bed.  What time was this?  It was like, I don't know, like around three in the morning. 
[03:48:30]  Okay.  All right.  Then I woke up again after 3.30 and my stomach was all messed up and I thought I shit myself  in the bed.  Were you sleeping in the bed with your wife?  Yeah.  Had you had intercourse?  Uh, oh yeah, this was after.  Guess what?  Guess what he just did?  He started the...  Did you hear what he just said?  What?  Remember on Monday when I said, did you have intercourse at my wedding?  And he said, we had a good time and he wouldn't tell me?  He just told me.  Thank you.  I told you I'd get it out of him. 
[03:49:00]  Or do you think you just didn't do it and he's just saying that?  Were you lying about that?  No.  Okay.  All right.  So you did have intercourse and then you shit yourself in the bed?  So I thought I did and I got up and...  What made you think that you shit yourself?  Because I woke up, my stomach was really bad.  Was there a smell?  And...  No, I just woke up and my stomach was going crazy and I'm like, oh my God.  I think I shit myself.  I jumped up and ran to the bathroom and as I'm pulling...  Wait, so it was just the way your stomach felt?  Like you just had a post shit myself stomach feeling? 
[03:49:30]  No, like currently shitting myself stomach feeling.  Okay.  Like you're like, I think that there is stuff coming out of my ass as I lay here.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Now I understand.  So I get up and I run to the bathroom and it turns out that wasn't happening in the bed.  It was a dream.  When I got to the bathroom, because I pulled my shorts down to take a look, that's when  it happened.  So you shit as you were pulling your pants down?  Yeah, as I ran to the bathroom. 
[03:50:00]  So while you were...  So did you start...  This guy need a pamper or something.  Did you start shitting...  Shit.  Did you start shitting while you were running or once you pulled your pants down?  Once I pulled my pants...  Well, as I was pulling my pants down by the toilet, all of a sudden I'm like, oh my God.  And, you know...  So did you get it all on your hands and shorts?  He had to.  No, but the way...  The way I was angled...  There was a lot of towels that were needed to clean up that were left in the bathtub.  Towels.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:50:30]  Was it wet?  Oh, it was flying.  Wait, wait, wait.  It was flying.  What did you wipe the towel...  What did you have to wipe the towels with?  Like, what did you...  What did you take the towels and wipe?  The parts that didn't make it into the toilet.  No, like what...  Why wouldn't you use toilet paper?  Where did you hit that wasn't the toilet?  Half the seat of the toilet to the floor and part of the wall right near where the sink  is.  To the window!  And you used towels instead of toilet paper? 
[03:51:00]  What kind of animal are you?  I used toilet paper when I was done.  Did you use any Opie socks?  No.  No.  We had towels on the floor there, so I just used those.  And I just cleaned up and then threw it into the bathtub.  So your wife...  It's a hotel.  Who cares?  Poor little Mexican maid that has to come in there and clean that shit up.  Right?  First of all...  Making like $3 an hour.  First of all, she's a Mexican in Middletown, Connecticut.  She couldn't be further from the border.  Right.  Second of all, she's got no relatives around her.  She's just depressed.  Yeah, man.  She has to clean up the sex bagels. 
[03:51:30]  Shit.  Yeah.  Shitty towels.  So tell me, your wife wakes up after a night of intercourse, and she goes to the bathroom,  and maybe to brush her teeth.  It was all...  No, I...  Maybe to take a shower before she got in there.  Wow.  Well, where'd you put the towels?  In the tub.  Okay.  And I pulled the shower curtain closed so you couldn't see them.  I'm sure you smell it.  Oh, dude.  So she probably...  But a lot of people...  I don't know if you know this, Eric, but a lot of people...  I've spoken to people.  When they wake up in the morning, they like to take a shower. 
[03:52:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, a lot of people do that.  So was there any...  No shower in the morning.  Did your wife attempt?  Whoa.  No, we just got dressed in the lab.  Kinky right there.  Did you tell her?  Uh, yeah, I told her.  Oh.  Was she like, of course she did.  Damn.  What did she say when you told her?  She was...  She didn't say much.  She just kept giving me looks.  She thought you were disgusting?  She was just like, ugh.  But she felt like shit, too.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  She might have been hungover, but you shit on a bunch of towels and threw them in the bathtub. 
[03:52:30]  That's two different stories.  There's no two.  You guys, we're not equals or partners.  No, I'm not saying that she did that as well.  I bet she didn't.  She's a lady.  Well, since the shit came out, did you have bang again?  Yeah, didn't you?  That's a great question.  No, I cleaned up and went back to sleep.  You didn't bang her again after?  You didn't?  No, she was out cold.  And I was just like, I'm not waking up.  What did you wipe with?  Did you have wet naps?  What?  Did you have wet naps?  I forgot to bring those with me.  Usually I have the wipes with me.  For these occasions. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, for when I shit all over hotel bathrooms.  So what did you just wipe with regular toilet paper?  Regular toilet paper and a washcloth.  Oh, what'd you do with the washcloth?  Was it a hotel washcloth?  No, I brought my own washcloth.  It was a hotel washcloth.  And what, you threw that in the tub too?  I threw it all in the tub.  Oh, you spoiled little rats.  I turned the water on a little bit.  So there's watery shit all over the tub.  And the brown is just all over all those white towels and it's watery.  And then I pulled the curtain closed.  But it must have stunk. 
[03:53:30]  No, it didn't smell.  Oh, I'm sure it did.  I'm sure it did.  It smelled like wet shit.  Oh, my God.  Hey, do you want to take a shower?  No, we don't have any towels.  Also, the bathtub is full of shit towels.  Yeah.  We don't have any towels because they're in the bathtub with shit on them.  Yeah, very exciting weekend, huh?  So, that's disgusting.  I have a feeling that he probably shits himself a lot.  No.  When was the last time you shit yourself before my wedding? 
[03:54:00]  Before your wedding.  I'll tell you why.  Actually, you know what?  My wife might know.  Oh, my God.  The fact that you were even married, the fact that it took place within the last two years.  No, I think it was longer than that.  I want you to know something, Eric.  Your insides are at war with you.  Oh, yeah.  I hate him.  They're like, why would you treat me like this?  I don't need another can of Cherry Coke Zero.  Yeah, no more.  Stop putting things in me.  And you should see him because I used to have to sit in that room with him.  He would literally just go, I gotta go shit, I gotta go shit.  And he'd go running out. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  When I feel a shit coming on, it's like, okay.  In a couple minutes, I'm going to head to the bathroom and take a dunk.  You go like this.  That's brewing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's poking its head.  I better get in there.  Yeah.  He goes running because he's afraid that it's going to fucking come flying out of him.  So, it's not...  Well, I also wait until the last possible moment, too.  It's not like, oh, it's coming.  I should go.  Yeah, but Eric, we all know that you do not like to move quickly.  So, that obviously doesn't have that much of a warning.  And we also know your diet. 
[03:55:00]  So, we know what you're putting inside your body.  That's right.  Those sandwiches, they come out.  That's why they call them sliders.  Am I right?  Yeah.  Grease everything right up.  Is that right, Eric?  Sure.  Why not?  You got shit up here.  Are you shit in Sirius the bathroom?  I have.  I don't make...  I try not to make a habit of it.  But you know what the trick is, who could?  Because I don't know who does it.  Especially on the weekends.  Oh, yeah.  Somebody demolishes those bathrooms on the weekends.  And all I'm going to say is...  And maybe you can vouch for this. 
[03:55:30]  Shade 45 has a lot of guests up here on the weekends.  I know.  With bizarre bowel habits.  And somehow, those bathrooms end up filled with unflushed toilets, dirty toilet paper,  and advertisements for mixtapes on the set.  So, I don't know exactly who's doing it.  You know what they like to do, too?  They like to make a little nest.  Whoever it is.  They like to fill it up with paper so they shit right on top of the paper and it just sits there like a trophy.  Like, what are you doing it for?  Well, they don't want any splashback.  Yeah.  Yeah, they want to keep themselves clean. 
[03:56:00]  And they're proud of it.  The expense of all of us.  They just keep it.  They don't flush it.  But, the trick is who can walk upstairs to 37 with the executive shit.  The quiet shit.  That's the one you got to go to.  Oh, okay.  The handicaps.  So, you get some extra room in there?  I saw some shiny shoes one time when I was shitting and then all of a sudden I was like,  Hey.  Who do you think that was?  Well, he was talking to me.  It was Blender.  I had to sign on my renewal, my contract.  So, he slid it under.  God damn it.  It was so close.  It was close.  Very close. 
[03:56:30]  He was going in, too.  He was?  What?  He didn't take the handicaps, though.  He was like breathing and okay.  Oh, my God.  There was a incredible Hulk next door.  That is disgusting.  People make some weird noises when they're shitting, man.  I had no idea.  I should find Roland.  Roland's got the best bathroom stories here.  No, you.  I don't think he's going to beat you with your hotel towels at my wedding.  No, here.  Jeremy, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  I want to know why E-Rock doesn't have any sphincter control.  Is his asshole always just wide open?  Is that what happens, E-Rock?  Do you keep your asshole always open, ready to expel? 
[03:57:00]  Ready to evacuate.  Ready to evacuate or receive.  Or receive.  No receiving, no.  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, you know, most of us.  Is it a surgical pronging down there?  Most of us are assholes.  Those doors are locked up tight and then we put that key.  Squeezy.  We call it squeezy.  Right.  We unlock it when it's time.  Yeah.  Eric basically just has that revolving door.  It's just constantly, whether it's going in or coming out, it doesn't matter.  That asshole.  It's breathing all day.  It is open for business.  I have a feeling Eric always has one on deck.  A little shit ready to go?  Ready to go. 
[03:57:30]  At any time, you can be like, Eric, here's, here's a hundred dollars.  Go shit right now.  And he could go pound out a little turd.  Eric, if I gave you.  I'm not pleasant to travel with.  If I gave you $15, could you shit for it right now?  No, right now.  No, I can't.  You can push that.  I don't think that's true.  You can push that.  Throw it another 20 if you can shit right here.  I'll put 20 in too.  You want to see, you guys want to, how about you give me $55?  I'll push one out.  Shit on the tape.  John in Massachusetts, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, you know they washed and reused those hotels. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, you're right, John.  I didn't even think of that.  All they do, they bleach them.  Do you think so?  That's how they get them real white like that.  I guess so.  But is that enough?  Well, at least it kills everything, doesn't it?  If Eric went to your house and he shit all over your towels, would you put the towels in the washing machine and throw some bleach and reuse them on your face?  Or would you throw them in the garbage?  Well, that's a little different.  Oh, is it?  Because every time I'd see that towel, I'd be like, oh, that has E-Rock shit on it.  Right.  But if you're just going to a hotel, like, dude, I guarantee you, you go to a hotel and you wash yourself off, you're washing your face with a towel. 
[03:58:30]  God only knows what those towels have fucking mopped up.  I can imagine.  The bed you're sleeping on is probably showered in jizz.  Yeah, but at least Eric didn't shit in it.  Jizz?  Jizz is just a bed.  Strangers, jizz?  Fuck that.  What would you rather have in your, what would you rather have?  A complete stranger.  That guy right there.  Truly.  Let's say, let's say he walks up to you.  Oh, shit.  And he's like, you have a choice right now. 
[03:59:00]  Either your whole family dies.  That's one.  Two, I'm going to shit all over your face.  Or three, I'm going to jizz all over your face.  And the amount of jizz is equivalent to the amount of shit.  And it's a good amount.  Shit, bye-bye, family.  What do you think?  Don't give me that choice.  Of course not.  You were ready to say kill my whole family without hearing the other two options.  I don't even do that.  Actually, what? 
[03:59:30]  Wipe them out.  What do you choose from the two?  Oh, man, it's tough.  Shit or jizz?  That's very tough, right?  What are you going to pay?  Well, shit just stinks.  That's the problem.  I feel like jizz, it's more liquidy.  You can wash it off easier.  Whereas shit, you would rather take shit.  It's the pride thing.  Yeah, that's that homophobic black culture.  It's okay to be homo, but I just don't like jizz on my face.  Oh, okay.  You've had jizz on your face?  No, I've never had jizz on my face.  I've seen jizz on my face.  That's a quote from who kid?  It's okay to be homo.  I just don't want jizz on my face. 
[04:00:00]  Troy, shit or jizz on your face?  Oh, man, that's a tough one.  From a dude, and you have to see the hole it comes out of.  Yipes.  I don't know.  Sal, shit or jizz?  I'm going with shit.  You'll go with shit.  Eric, shit or jizz?  I don't know.  I'll take shit all day.  You would.  Troy, you've taken your own jizz in the mouth.  Yeah, it's my own.  That's your own, though?  It's my own jizz.  Would you take your own shit in your mouth?  For a bet, sure.  But what if this girl was like, my thing is for you to shit in my hand, and then I shove 
[04:00:30]  it in your mouth?  The same girl who snowballed you.  Would you do that?  In the moment?  Maybe.  Things are hot?  It's mine.  Troy, do you know what snowballing is?  Who, kid?  Uh-oh.  Snowballing is when a girl's blowing you.  You come in her mouth, and then before she swallows, she open-mouthed kisses you and  passes your semen into your own mouth.  Damn.  Troy did this, but who, kid?  Don't judge him.  I judged him at first, too.  But I found out who it was with. 
[04:01:00]  It was with a famous porn star who you would know.  That information's out there.  Yeah.  Famous porn star.  I'm not going to mention her by name, but it's like upper echelon.  Super, super, super.  Yes.  Crazy, crazy.  And so I said, knowing who it was, I would do that, too.  Wow.  But I wouldn't take a handful of my own shit and eat it.  I don't think it could get that hot.  I think it could.  You think?  Yeah.  I haven't been in all the situations we've been in, either.  It's kind of crazy.  But what would it, what would it, it would take more for you to eat your own shit than for 
[04:01:30]  you to eat your own jizz?  What are you showing at?  Dude, I've got to hang out with you, man.  Who's that?  What is she just, some girls dancing?  Porn store.  Who's that?  And two girls are making out.  Who are those girls?  So I think.  Hey, God damn it.  One of them is Alexis Ford.  I think you'd go for jizz.  Huh?  I think you'd go for jizz.  That's a tough one, man.  I think I would go for jizz. 
[04:02:00]  I think if you go and get a shower after that, the jizz is easier to wash off.  And the jizz, I think, would be easier to cleanse from your soul.  You ever have like a bad odor?  Like somebody vomits.  Exactly.  And even if like you walk away from it, you still smell it.  It's like in your nose hairs.  Don't it smell like Clorox?  I've got to talk to Opie about this tomorrow.  Because Opie had baby shit on his upper lip.  That's normal, though.  I tasted my baby shit.  No, like he took somebody else's baby shit.  Oh, about that.  And put his finger in it.  And then wiped a mustache with it.  No, that's Roth.  He's disgusting. 
[04:02:30]  That's terrible.  Okay.  What did your baby shit taste like?  He just shat it on me one day.  And it just splattered.  And it went in my mouth.  And I tasted it.  How did it taste?  It tasted like salted butter.  Oh, okay.  That sounds all right.  That doesn't sound too bad.  It was great.  So have you and your wife spoken, E-Rock, about your shitting yourself at my wedding?  No, this has been an ongoing subject.  What has?  About my stomach.  You sit there and talk to your wife about your bowel movements?  I don't.  She talks about the fact that I'm constantly having stomach problems. 
[04:03:00]  If you go on YouTube, what did you have to look up, Sal?  Just baby diaper mustache.  Baby diaper mustache.  You can find Opie in his plastic.  Well, watch him.  He's dead ass serious.  See, he's got baby shit on each of his fingers.  Opie's my hero, man.  Watch what he does.  This is disgusting.  He is dying right now.  All right.  This is called...  Who's the baby?  It's called baby diaper mustache.  Rich Voss' baby.  He's really going hard.  Two, three.  One, two, three. 
[04:03:30]  2008 was a good year.  No, for opiate, wasn't it?  One, two, three, dude.  That Abercrombie and Fitch was retired.  That hoodie.  That's fucking gross.  Disgusting, man.  That's my hero.  God damn it.  Check it out on YouTube.  Baby diaper mustache.  Jesus fucking gross.  Opie wasn't the same for a long time after that, and it was tough to get his wife to kiss him again.  Yeah, I remember that.  So you and your wife, Eric, have conversations about your bowel movements. 
[04:04:00]  Not about my bowel movements.  The fact that I have stomach problems.  What is she saying?  She wants me to go see a doctor.  Why do you have to see a doctor?  Doesn't she look at what you're putting in your body?  Doesn't she see you're not exercising and putting shit in your body?  Like, if you just ate like a rational person, and you know...  It doesn't matter what I eat.  You want to make a bet?  Your tummy gets upset regardless?  Mm-hmm.  How often do you have tummy troubles? 
[04:04:30]  Fairly often.  How often?  How often?  Could be, you know, every few days.  Jesus Christ.  Shut up.  You shut up for his wife.  Like, his wife maybe can stick her finger in there and see what's in there.  What do you think about that?  Have you ever...  I do that with my dog.  When my dog constipates, I stick my finger in there.  You stick your finger...  Never constipate.  What?  You stick your finger in your dog's ass?  Yeah, that's what everybody does, right?  Troy, have you stuck a finger in your dog's...  I mean, I've had to do things to my dog's ass.  Yeah, like, the shit won't come out.  I had to stick my finger in there.  Has your wife ever stuck her finger in your ass? 
[04:05:00]  Eric?  No.  No, she hasn't done that.  No, no.  Yeah, because this is not...  This is not right.  It's not normal.  Every two or three days, you have tummy troubles?  It happens.  Roland, how often do you get tummy upset?  I want to eat like shit.  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.  But it's just you eating like shit.  Yeah.  Eric is trying to figure out the mystery of why he shits himself at weddings.  I'll give you a clue.  You eat a Burger King burger, bad things are going to happen at the hall.  Oh, my God. 
[04:05:30]  It's like...  It's like an abortion.  I don't know.  What have you tried?  Chemically imbalanced.  That's not it.  I don't even know how Eric lives.  Like, he sits there, and he can't sleep, so he goes in for sleep studies.  And now he's got tummy upset, so he's got to have his stomach looked at.  Like, everything is going wrong with this person.  I used to be so bad at my diet that my old boss made me shit in a hotel next door, not  in the office.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Eric, so you don't think that, like, if you just had a healthy diet and you exercised, 
[04:06:00]  that after some time, maybe you wouldn't have tummy upset anymore?  It probably would be less often.  It would probably help a lot.  But even when I was in good shape, it still was...  Eh.  Not as frequent, but I'd still have problems.  Yeah, but you were five years old then.  You know, you had to take some of the towel.  You see what I did there, right, Troy?  I did, yeah.  You like that?  Well, I mean, you're telling the truth, so...  Okay, yeah.  It's just like...  It's just like, oh, okay, there's some honesty.  Why is he shitting at your wedding, though?  Yeah, I mean... 
[04:06:30]  It wasn't at his wedding.  Well, it was that night, though.  Oh, in the evening.  After the wedding.  He passed all the festivities.  I don't know, Snoop Dogg shitted while we were just talking.  I was like, wow.  He shit himself?  Mm-hmm.  Well, how high was he?  He was super high.  And so he shit himself.  But the whole stomach was, like, numb.  He didn't know if he was shitting.  Did he stink?  Nah, it smelled like roses for some reason.  I don't know.  It's probably all that herb.  He doesn't eat anything.  He's thin, too.  So he doesn't eat a lot, I don't think.  Right.  So he just had little sliver shits coming out into his pants.  That's disgusting.  It was commando, too, so...  I'm sorry to hear about that.  Straight down the pants. 
[04:07:00]  Well, listen.  What's it called?  Bo Bowie today in honor of T-Bowie on Jimmy Fallon's album.  Thanks, Todd.  Probably get to that tomorrow.  Eric, can we make sure we do that tomorrow?  We'll have it tomorrow.  What if you blow that guy up and then he don't call you back?  Bobo?  Yeah.  I would literally like to blow him up.  Oh, okay.  Like, actually shove some dynamite up his ass and light it.  Blow him up.  Who Kid?  Thank you for stopping by.  Of course, man.  Troy.  Can I promote something real quick?  Yeah, yeah, real quick.  Tomorrow, Thursday night at Los Feliz on the Lower East Side. 
[04:07:30]  I'm doing a big party called Bump.  We did it last week.  It was our first week.  And we're doing it again this week.  It was huge.  If you like house music, remixes, electro, come out, Los Feliz.  And Troy opens the show by jerking off.  So it's something you've got to see to believe.  I do.  And then I shit myself.  I give myself a mustache.  Right.  And then Eric comes and throws the towels in the bathtub.  If you want to see me jerk off, I'm at Veranda tomorrow with hip-hop and, you know,  a whole bunch of ballers and, you know.  All right.  So we've got hip-hop covered.  We've got house music covered.  That's right.  Come over and watch me jerk off.  Loving it.  We'll see you more of this tomorrow.  Ron and Fez are coming up next. 
[04:08:00]  Live as always.  Goodbye, everybody.  Opie and Anthony's show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
