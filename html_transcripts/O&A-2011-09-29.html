<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a surprisingly profane introduction from Larry King, setting a tone for the rest of the show.  The hosts immediately launched into complaints about their studio's poor lighting, a stark contrast to Howard Stern's newly renovated, high-tech digs (Stern being on vacation, prompting jokes about him being a "part-timer").  They then aired their grievances regarding Bobo, a recurring caller who had secretly appeared on the Howard Stern Show.  The hosts revealed photographic and audio evidence of Bobo's subterfuge, leading to a hilarious dissection of Bobo's increasingly absurd justifications.

The show continued with a recounting of their Radiohead concert experience, including humorous encounters with celebrities like Philip Seymour Hoffman (bootlegging the concert), Cameron Diaz (who rebuffed a photo request), and John McEnroe. This transitioned into a heated discussion surrounding the Occupy Wall Street protests and the media's coverage, particularly lambasting Lawrence O'Donnell's commentary on the pepper-spraying incident, which they deemed biased and overly dramatic; clips of O'Donnell's segment were played throughout this segment. The hosts also speculated about the Red Sox's poor season and the potential drug use among school bus drivers.  A retired NYPD officer, Larry, joined the studio to offer his perspective on crowd control at the protests, contrasting past methods with current limitations.  The discussion also touched on perceived double standards in law enforcement’s treatment of different protest groups and the protesters' perceived willingness to provoke conflict for media attention.  The hosts further criticized MSNBC's alleged liberal bias, focusing their ire on Lawrence O'Donnell and Reverend Al Sharpton, mocking their on-air personas. Other humorous segments included a discussion of a comedic LA city council roll call featuring the name "Mike Hunt," a critique of Jose Reyes' controversial bunt, a lengthy discussion on the anxieties of salon shampoos, a bizarre debate on the most terrifying animal, and the dismissal of a South African radio anchor for excessive profanity. The show also covered a discussion on the Ken Burns effect (and his hairpiece), reactions to various online videos (including a cute kitten video), and mentioned upcoming guest Patrice O'Neal, along with staff members Travis, Sam Roberts, and Cowhead.

Patrice O'Neal then joined the show in studio.  The segment began with viewing and commenting (with copious expletives) on a honey badger video, highlighting its aggressive nature. The conversation then shifted to internet cat videos, specifically focusing on a sleeping kitten, an angry cat video with 64 million views, and a video of a man yelling at his cat.  A significant portion of the segment was dedicated to a vulgar discussion of blocking people on Twitter, with Patrice detailing his methods and criteria for blocking, and the hosts and callers sharing their own experiences. This included a brief pre-recorded interview with Christian Slater promoting "Primetime Sam Roberts" and a question about "Top Chef."  The segment concluded with promotion of Patrice O'Neal’s upcoming comedy shows.

Comedian Lewis Black joined the show as a guest, along with Patrice O'Neal.  Black discussed his experiences in the theater world, the challenges of playwriting, and the frustratingly low pay in the industry. He also shared his views on fame and the entertainment industry, expressing cynicism and disillusionment.  A significant portion focused on his political views, particularly regarding the 2012 election, the economic situation, and his criticism of the government, expressed with strong, vulgar language.  He discussed his views on Obama, the role of social media, and the potential for social unrest. He also shared anecdotes, including a abruptly ended Telepictures meeting due to his criticism of Anderson Cooper.  The conversation touched on the prevalence of guns in America and comparisons between different comedians’ audiences.

The final segment featured a heated, profanity-laced debate between Opie and Anthony regarding the Occupy Wall Street protests, with Anthony expressing skepticism about the protesters’ motivations and Opie countering his generalizations. This debate escalated into a contentious argument with Lewis Black, who sharply criticized Anthony's perspective, leading to personal attacks and insults.  Anthony mentioned a large number of pilots among protesters, which Opie disputed.  The mention of a listener named Morgan in Houston, who was angry at Anthony, was included.  Finally, Patrice O'Neal was mentioned again, and the show concluded with the playing of Drew Boogi's song "Me Me Me," described as a Jim Norton-esque emo song, and a discussion of the song's length.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, it's Larry King. What the hell am I doing here?  Wait a minute, you want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You gotta catch it.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite.  Yeah, oh fuck yeah! This place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on it, though.  Yeah, I think a lot. It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews and of course, your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio. 
[00:00:30]  But I'm still proud to intro it.  The show is so disorganized.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying that, well then turn off!  God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts and we already know this is gonna be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you gonna be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way, morning. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, good morning.  Well, that sounds a little off, but...  What are you gonna do?  Sounds a little, uh, tinny.  But...  Does it?  Yeah, a little bit on my end.  A little weird.  I don't know what it is, but...  I'll just jail it.  Bye.  Give me ten minutes, it'll sound like every other day.  There it is.  My ears are very adaptable.  Very adaptable. 
[00:01:30]  Hi, everyone.  Yeah, maybe we should turn off the new lights.  You think that's...  We'll turn them down a little bit.  That might be doing it.  Oh, God.  No, not off.  Oh, you said...  I guess there's a lighter shade of yellow down today.  A lighter shade of pale, Opie.  How about we do this?  Yeah.  We don't want yellow.  We don't want yellow, I think.  Let's move the fuck on from yellow.  I thought we actually...  Please.  I thought we actually got...  Oh, God.  No, that's not it. 
[00:02:00]  Now it's...  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, you got us, all right.  Yeah.  Can we use Howard's studio?  Because I just found out he's on his latest vacation.  He's not going to be back for a week and a half.  Didn't he just take...  What is...  How do you get that deal?  See, he's in bizarro world where vacation is work and work is vacation.  Yeah.  So he gets more vacation time.  He did three days this week and now he's on another vacation for a week and a half.  Yeah.  They just gave him a brand new studio. 
[00:02:30]  Can you turn off the lights?  I'm going blind.  It really is.  By the way, it's so hard to do.  I'm not pitching.  Everything's okay.  It's so hard.  I feel like I'm in a microwave.  Everything's okay.  That's...  Can we just march down the hall?  You got the key?  Can you turn that shit on?  It's that easy.  That's our yellow.  No one's using it for a week and a half.  It's our yellow, though, he says.  We're all the same company.  Let's just walk down the hall.  Mars, go get the key.  I'll do it right the fuck now.  I like saying we're all one big happy family.  We are.  Yeah.  And if there's a really nice studio that's not going to be used for at least another week 
[00:03:00]  and a half.  A week and a half?  Really?  You know, they'd have to.  I'd ask for a day off and they're like, well, if you have to.  I'm like, what?  If I have to?  If you're gone enough where they have to dust when you come back.  Yeah.  Like, they literally have to dust when they come back to make sure everything still works.  And it's funny because the Howard listeners, it hurts to hear this, but they're starting  to listen more and more to Opie and Anthony.  I hear it. 
[00:03:30]  I see it.  And then you got the hardcores that are just trying to hang on.  They think it's still the 90s.  They're trying to hang on.  But even they realize that their hero is now a part-timer and he deserves that.  I'm happy for him.  Very happy.  Who couldn't be more happy?  But we like telling it like it is.  The guy is now officially a part-timer.  But those hardcore just hanging on, man.  Yeah.  You want to be just like him.  Hey, you want to be?  Screw you.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  As far as time off, God, am I a wannabe. 
[00:04:00]  Of course.  Oh, am I a wannabe.  Of course.  But you know what?  It would be so nice.  But I see the tweets coming in.  Yeah, yeah.  They're coming in.  People are coming over here to check out some live radio.  And I appreciate that.  Yeah, who would?  And I don't blame Howard for being a part-timer now.  You know, he's well up into his 50s, pushing 60.  He wants fucking some time off.  Absolutely.  So now he's on his latest vacation, which is a week and a half.  Why?  Because it's a Jewish holiday?  Oh.  That's right. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, wait a minute.  Isn't it Rosh Hashanah?  You bet it is.  I'm blowing the show for Robin.  Is that a company holiday?  No, it's Jewish New Year.  Yeah, that's a company holiday.  It's the year 5,000-something, right?  That's right.  It's like 5,720-something, I think.  How do you wear those glasses?  Crazy.  Yeah.  What is it?  Happy New Year.  How the fuck do you wear those glasses?  You got a big 5,000-something.  We got all confused with the 2011 glasses, but fuck. 
[00:05:00]  Try wearing a 5, 7, 8, and 3.  Yeah, it's tilted to one side.  Fucking ears bleeding.  This is the year 5, 7, 7, 2.  5, 7, 7, 2.  Try to look through 5, 7, 7, 2 if you're wearing the glasses.  You're just going to look stupid.  5, 7, 7, 2.  Can you do that?  Can you walk around?  Yeah, well, you could take the bottom loop of the 5 and then kind of make a loop out of  the bottom of the 2 and have two 7s between your eyes? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  That looks stupid.  Right.  Well, there you go.  I'm just thinking of yarmulke with it spelt on top.  Yeah.  Okay.  Like in a round thing, like a nose cone of a rocket.  Sam, how about we move on from yellow?  Yeah, let's move on from yellow.  Just move on from yellow.  We'll try something new.  It's trial and error here.  Sure.  More error than trial.  Right.  But let's just give it a whirl.  How about something in a very peach-ish kind of tan.  By the way. 
[00:06:00]  Natural nude.  Like just lights without gels?  Yeah, thank you.  Well, we need like a blue, like I'm saying, a peach possibly, and maybe that weird purplish  like lavender one.  I don't know what the official color is of that.  I can get purple lights.  Don't, no, no, no.  Not purple.  No, no, no, no.  We don't want it.  This shit is very subtle.  To look like a Foghat concert.  I forgot.  I forgot Sam's taking a crash course in lighting because there's no one else that knows how  to do this.  What do you want, like Royal Blue?  Fucking no.  Sam was an intern, what, a year ago, and now he's a light expert all of a sudden. 
[00:06:30]  Six years ago.  Think of the new fucking shit you can put on your resume now.  Yep.  Lighting expert.  You can literally put lighting technician.  Studio lighting tech.  Studio lighting tech.  Studio.  Live studio lighting tech.  Right.  Boom.  You got a new gig.  I just want to post pictures of the studio.  Now please, or audio of people talking about your lighting prowess.  No, no, no.  No, no.  We're good.  No.  One, two, three, four, five.  Howard listeners on the lines. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, thank you.  Because that's what's really happening.  So the hardcores, you can hang in there as much as you want.  I hope our hardcores hang on when we're literally calling it in.  We're not calling it in yet.  Not yet.  If you think we are, oh boy, this gets a lot worse.  If you think we're calling it in now, wait until we call it in, and this will look like  we're working so hard.  By the way, could somebody that represents the show, and I'm just saying it like that,  I want you to send E-Rock's pictures of the studio to stupid Scott Greenstein and go, 
[00:07:30]  the guys want to know if this is acceptable.  I'm not going to do that.  Is that stupid dot?  Yeah.  Yeah, stupid dot Greenstein at.  Okay.  It was just, I didn't know the address.  Because, you know, this guy with this, I got it, I got it shit.  I want him to see these pictures, and I want to ask him if this is acceptable.  That is the best picture I've ever seen of how this studio looks with the lights on.  Yeah, because he's running the programming here at SiriusXM. 
[00:08:00]  We're supposedly a big show, and we're bathed in horrible yellow lighting now.  It's like a bug light.  You know those yellow light bulbs you used to put in outside so you wouldn't get skeeters  biting you?  Well.  That's how this feels.  The moths went away.  That's good.  Yeah, the moths are gone.  They're gone.  They're just kind of swirling around the lights now.  It's like we're outside.  This is good.  I feel like when Kramer put a screen door on the front of his apartment.  It's like outside, but inside.  Yeah.  So what am I getting next? 
[00:08:30]  A purple one or a blue one?  Well, we want the keys for Howard's studio, because if he's not using it for a week and  a half and we're one big happy family, we should be able to march in there and have the proper  facility.  And we don't need to turn everything on.  Nah.  Just a few lights.  We don't need the screen back there.  We don't need the big Howard Stern show lit logo.  Yeah.  We don't need the really nice studio stage lighting.  Is that a Broadway show going on in there every day?  I don't know.  I think it is.  It's amazing.  It really is beautiful.  It's gorgeous.  It's really sad that it's not being used. 
[00:09:00]  It looks like a Fox News set.  It's like when they come in with the crane shot and it just looks gorgeous.  Look at this shot.  It's stunning.  And it won't even be turned on for another 10 to 11 days.  Now, they're going to have to grease all the fittings where the cameras move and everything  when they come back.  It's amazing.  Don't be confused.  This isn't a rant against Howard.  It really isn't.  It's not.  Have you seen the lighting?  Friday, Sunday, Sunday, Monday.  Wait, wait. 
[00:09:30]  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.  12 days.  That studio is not going to be used.  That has got to be fucking.  By the time he comes back from his latest vacation, we will have another seven shows under our pen.  Whatever.  Whatever, man.  You know, how are you going to?  What are you going to do?  Oh, that's the old studio? 
[00:10:00]  Mm-hmm.  Look at, look at.  We would take the old studio.  That's the shitty studio.  Oh, my God.  And then they do a time-lapse of them.  Look at the workers.  They're like ants.  How many people?  Look at how hard they're working on that studio.  We got Mars, and he's got a whole fucking team.  Look at all these people.  That is amazing.  We're literally looking at a time-lapse of them redoing the studio.  And it's amazing.  How long did that take?  18 months to do? 
[00:10:30]  Was it like the building of the Empire State Building?  Wow.  Goddamn, when I was a part-timer, I didn't get this shit.  Oh, my God.  With that beautiful screen.  Why are you nervous when I say part-timer?  That's what it is.  The company just doesn't want the people to know that.  If you're working three days a week and you get a lot of vacation off, that's part-time radio.  Oh, it's part-time.  Oh, my God.  The guy behind the couch changes colors.  They brought in, like, what the heck?  I don't know what to say.  There's got to be that amazing.  It looks like there's 10 to 12 people working on that. 
[00:11:00]  We have Mars.  Oh, yeah.  And there it is.  Ta-da.  We don't even have one.  Could you go back to our studio?  Holy shit.  Could you go back to our studio?  Yeah, now go back to the E-Rog.  There you go.  There you go.  And that's why we bitch, by the way.  We live in the ghetto.  And that's why we bitch.  We're in the ghetto.  Looking at us in horrible yellow lighting.  After that beautiful fucking video of the new studio.  That's why we bitch.  And again, nothing against the studio, him, whatever. 
[00:11:30]  God bless him.  Hey, congrats.  Oh, yeah.  But, wow, is there a drop-off?  Do you want me to turn the big lights on?  No.  No, no.  Please, no, never again.  If I have shades, that would be one thing.  Yeah.  Our future's so bright.  Right.  You've got to wear sunglasses indoors.  No, that means we'll be outdoors soon.  Oh.  Yeah.  Exactly.  If I was serious, I'd say I wouldn't change the channel name.  There it is.  That's going to be a waste of time. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, brother.  Speaking of Howard, we lost Bobo to Howard, I guess.  Yep.  Yeah.  We all saw it happen.  Yeah.  We read it on Twitter.  Yeah.  The news is out.  Yeah.  We got exclusive audio of Bobo and Howard Stern.  How do we got that?  Do you think he would try to cover this up like he did the pictures?  Yeah.  Your staff is very good at finding things.  Uncovering.  Yeah.  Really?  Yep.  Detectives.  So this is how it went down, I guess.  We got a little clip of Bobo on Howard's show. 
[00:12:30]  Just one clip.  I think he did like an hour and a half.  The lack of loyalty from that boy.  Disgusting.  Oh, God.  After all, we've done for that.  Let's go to Bobo for the morning.  Let him start off.  Come on.  It makes his day.  I was here.  I had to take the phone off my ear for a second.  All right.  Here's Bobo, who is going to now try to win Metallica tickets.  Of course, we got to do something to win those tickets, don't we?  I guess I take one of the shit.  Oh, my.  Bobo, what was that crap you just handed there? 
[00:13:00]  Bobo, don't hand me shit.  What are you doing?  You have an 80-something IQ.  At least I'm not a Jew.  Bobo's right.  Our show is great.  I think it's a terrific show, but I think this guy's fucking obsessed.  He is.  I get a life.  Hey, you there.  Yeah, I'm talking to you.  I don't go to your job and suck all the dicks that you work with.  All right.  Thank you, Bobo.  Your mom's box.  She was positive. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, positive right there.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, he's lying.  He's lied to us and said he wasn't on Howard.  And meanwhile, that's obvious.  We got a photo.  We got audio.  And then we got him calling the office yesterday because the pressure got to him.  Finally admitted it.  The pressure got to him.  And he finally called the boys after the show yesterday because it's been talked about  on Twitter ad nauseam.  So this went down yesterday after the show.  Those photos, my uncle forced me to go on there. 
[00:14:00]  Your uncle forced you to go on what?  My uncle Mike.  He forced you to go on Howard?  Yeah, he did.  So you're admitting that those photos are real?  I knew it was.  It was fake.  They weren't supposed to be up there.  He made me take that photo.  Well, why would he do that?  I mean, he knew it was going to get you in trouble with us.  What, did you think it was never going to get out?  Well, the thing is, he can't, he can't, he's always, we're always doing arguments over 
[00:14:30]  who's better because I'm going to want to say that he's a Howard fan.  Right, so he kidnapped you and then brought you into the Howard studio and then forced  you to hold up a sign that says, fuck ONA, and then he took the picture and put it online?  No, no, he, no, he told me that the sign wasn't going to say that.  Oh, well, what did he say the sign was going to say?  No, it was going to say three hours, I played just advertising the show, but he wasn't going 
[00:15:00]  to say that.  I said I was only going to do that if I didn't rat out anybody.  What is going on now?  It's just an idiot.  Someone explain this to me.  Uncle Mike made him go on Howard's show.  No, no, no, stop, Sam, please.  You can do that goofiness on the talk like that.  What is really happening here?  Oh, you got face.  What is really happening here?  Out of nowhere, he's decided that he has been on Howard's show?  I'll tell you exactly what happened.  Danny and I are in the office doing our work. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  The phone rings.  By the way, oh, sorry.  By the way, the phone rings, and he just starts explaining away that he was on Howard  and the photos are real, and he decided to just sass up to it.  But now he's going with the, trying to go with the, go with the bit.  I'm going with the bit for the show.  I think he's trying to say whatever he can say that's most likely to get him back on this  show.  He realized, yeah, he realized saying, you know, denying it wasn't going to work. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  So now he's just embracing it.  But now we're going to, now we're going to throw it the other way.  Of course.  How many times did Opie say yesterday, I believe you, I don't think this is real, you are telling  the truth, this is a Photoshop, but it's a Photoshop, but it's a, but it's a Photoshop.  I said, I believe you.  Yeah, I know, but it's a Photoshop.  I believe you.  It was, it was not me.  I wasn't in there.  Someone took a photo and did some things to it.  I'm telling you without a doubt.  I believe you.  Yeah.  It was a Photoshop. 
[00:16:30]  And what I'm saying is, but it was fake.  I know.  For the show.  I know.  A photo job.  What an ass.  So now what do we have to do with this?  Yeah.  Where do we go?  Just stop talking.  Travis.  Thank you, Travis.  Travis.  Thank you, Travis.  Nah.  It's enough.  I feel like Travis today.  Enough already.  Stop taking his calls.  I mean, the Howard audio at Bobo's hilarious.  That is really good.  Because it was also cut up in a way where it makes it obvious that it's not happening,  which makes it funnier.  But now he ruins it by now admitting he was. 
[00:17:00]  It's nonsense.  Because it's nonsense.  It's some classic Bobo Mullins that we remember him saying on our show.  Right, right, right, right.  That's the best part.  You can hear the phone filter on one of them because we're laughing in the background and  Bobo talking on the phone.  Well, and the other thing is then all of a sudden Bobo's in the studio, but the bit starts  with him on the phone.  On the phone.  And he handed something on the phone.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know how Howard does the show.  But now Bobo has decided that he has been on Howard.  Apparently, yeah.  Holy shit.  He's strategic in his thinking. 
[00:17:30]  That's one way to put it.  How did we get Dr. Retard?  I don't know.  We got to get rid of him.  I feel like we're responsible for this kid.  We really did.  Yeah.  We have to get rid of him.  Yeah.  Stop, because now that causes a thing.  What the hell causes a thing with this guy?  A thing.  There's always a thing.  All right.  And his mom calls.  Don't hurt my Bobo.  We're like, I'm right.  We haven't done anything.  We gave him a life.  Guy goes to fucking everywhere he goes dressed in Bobo gear.  He's got Bobo attire he wears.  What's Bobo gear?  And stands around waiting to be fucking recognized. 
[00:18:00]  He's got shirts.  O&A shirts.  And then he's got a Bobo jersey.  Yeah.  And a hat he walks around in.  And I'm Bobo.  Hello.  I'm Bobo.  Eric said that he's gone to comedy clubs.  And Bobo has passed out, printed out pictures of himself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  They're 8x10s.  That's his life.  We should sue him.  Not allow him to use any references to the show or images.  Trust me.  We've told him that we're doing that. 
[00:18:30]  Of course.  Yeah.  Any horrible thing you can imagine, these motherfuckers have told Bobo.  Trademarked his name.  You can't use Bobo.  You've got to go with BB.  Pick another vowel, fucker.  You know, I've got to say something.  This whole Bobo experience over the last few years, my heart cries for people out there.  Because I know in their lives, we do talk to people that have a slow one. 
[00:19:00]  We'll call them a slow one.  We completely understand your world now.  Completely.  I'm serious.  Yeah.  I'm serious.  I don't even know how to get anything done.  It is true.  It's been an education.  Right.  I have more of an open mind for the Tards.  An open mind.  So sensitive.  Tell them what happened when you told them that there was another, we had copyrighted  the Bobo name.  A while ago, we told Bobo that we had copyrighted his name Bobo and he couldn't use it anymore. 
[00:19:30]  And we had hired a new Bobo.  New Bobo.  And this went back and forth for a few days.  And eventually, he called pretending to be new Bobo.  Right.  Quitting.  Right.  Because new Bobo couldn't take just how mean you guys were being to old Bobo.  And he was going to give old Bobo back.  Can we hire a new Bobo?  Of course we can.  That's a brilliant bit.  Yeah.  Who's going to be the new Bobo?  And we can audition. 
[00:20:00]  New Bobo.  And you want to audition for the new Bobo?  Yeah.  Who wants to be the new Bobo?  Because, you know, this is not a stretch because here at SiriusXM, they like to try to own  your name.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is.  By the time they were trying to own Opie, I'm like, I've had this name since I was 12.  Go fuck yourself.  And Anthony's my name.  Right.  It's just my real name.  There have been shows that you know well where they tried to own the name of the show.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  They're worse than Vince McMahon. 
[00:20:30]  They really are.  Change your real name so they can own it.  Yeah.  There was one show in particular that they wanted to own the show name and not pay the  person for doing a show.  Thank you.  Yeah.  And then you're supposed to say thank you when that happens.  Yeah.  I love this place.  All right.  How was Radiohead, guys?  I wanted to go, but I couldn't get a babysitter, to be completely honest with you.  Oh, damn it.  Well, let me tell you.  I think I'm going tonight.  I went. 
[00:21:00]  Travis went.  Yes.  We had two different experiences, let's say.  Travis, more of a regular fan experience guy.  Yeah.  Nice.  Me, more the I'm much too important to hang out with the throngs of people down on the  floor.  You couldn't sneak Travis up there?  VIP section.  I didn't want to be up there.  I wanted to be with the people.  The view up there must have been nice.  I was on the side of the stage.  I had a great view.  Yeah.  That's fucking fantastic.  What was that?  An hour to get in? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  About an hour to get in for Travis.  I was on the side of the stage.  I'm watching Tom.  That's great right there, as a matter of fact.  Nice and cool.  It's really cool back there.  I was directly above you.  Yeah.  Like, directly above you.  Yeah.  Where's the shows again?  Roseland.  Roseland.  Roseland.  Nice.  Yeah.  Nice, nice, nice.  That was a great show.  Yeah.  Aside from going on at 10-15.  10-15?  How am I going to do that?  You didn't?  Because they're not going on any earlier tonight.  No, they're not.  I mean, that's not.  I'm actually all tired.  Are you guys still tired?  All right, I'm pretty beat, but going to the show tonight. 
[00:22:00]  And then, after party.  I know where it's at.  Yo.  Going to the Radiohead after party?  Yeah, we were hanging out with their fucking, their managers last night.  Yeah.  Their two old English guys.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  And we got cordially invited to the after party.  Nice.  Tonight.  Nice.  And then I was watching, I was watching the show with none other than Philip Seymour Hoffman. 
[00:22:30]  Really?  I was sitting at his table, his little round table that's in the VIP section.  What do you mean you were sitting at his table?  Well, there's the VIP section, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's up on the, if you're looking at the stage, it's up on the upper left-hand side.  Yes.  And then there's the strip of the section that is like VIP.  And then there's the VVIP, which are the little round cocktail tables.  Were you a VVIP?  Yeah.  And there I am.  And there's Philip Seymour Hoffman videotaping Radiohead behind me. 
[00:23:00]  Fucking extreme!  That's hilarious.  Extreme, dude!  In the end, he's just a fan.  Dude, I was with Dusty.  That's cool.  From fucking Twister.  He's just bootlegging a show like any other fan would do.  He's bootlegging the fucking show.  Was he just doing a song, or was he really obsessed with videotaping?  He was doing quite a bit.  Wow, really?  He was leaning like in front of me.  Yeah.  And videotaping, or recording the band.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, Edward Norton.  Nice. 
[00:23:30]  He was up there.  Chris Rock.  Did you talk to any of these guys?  Yeah.  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Was he cool?  John McEnroe.  Yeah.  It was just pretty much a, hey, how you doing?  Right, right.  We're sitting at the same table.  Right.  And Cameron Diaz, that twat.  Why is she a twat?  What a fucking bitch.  I'm glad A-Rod dumped your fucking old ass.  You got a good picture, though.  Yeah, I did.  There's my picture.  See her blonde hair?  That's me and her.  Where?  Where is she?  Seriously.  Right there.  That clump of blonde is her head.  Well, what did you do?  I had my camera in my hand. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  It was all ready to go.  She's walking out.  I went, hey, Cameron, picture?  You know?  Yeah.  And I was ready to just snap it, and she winged her head to the side and goes, no, and I just  snapped instantly, and that's the picture I got.  You can't tell that's Cameron Diaz.  Of course you can't, but it is.  You know it is.  That's it.  It's the top of her head.  Yeah, that top of the head has been probably right there on A-Rod's abdomen.  Well, now you know what A-Rod sees.  As she was sucking his cock.  Now you know what A-Rod sees.  There you go. 
[00:24:30]  That's the A-Rod view.  How does she look in person?  Old.  She does, right?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I hear.  She's no kid anymore.  I hear she looks old.  She looked like shite.  There's a whole makeup thing that happens.  Does John McEnroe remember that we did his show?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he does?  John McEnroe was cool.  Because he kind of liked us.  He was wearing his Giants cap.  McEnroe kind of liked us.  John McEnroe was very cool.  Yeah.  He's got to come on the radio show again.  He was sitting to my right for a little while after Philip Seymour Hoffman moved to get 
[00:25:00]  a better bootleg view, I think.  I think he was going to get a better bootleg.  Great.  Bootleg view.  Nice.  But it was a lot of fun.  That was my experience.  That's the view I had of the crowd, too.  That's cool.  It was a pretty fucking amazing crowd.  Yeah, you were right.  So what did Radiohead decide to do?  A lot of weird shit.  A lot of new stuff.  New stuff.  They did like 20 songs and 13 of them were off the last two albums.  Wow.  Any hits at all?  Well, hits for people that just bought the album. 
[00:25:30]  What would be the most popular song they did that the masses would possibly know?  National Anthem.  Probably.  Okay.  Off Kid A.  Wow.  Yeah.  Nothing from the Benz?  They did Street Spirit, the last song.  Yeah, right on.  Okay.  Encore was pretty fucking good.  What was it?  Encore was...  Well, they did two encores.  I didn't think they were going to do a second encore.  I don't think they planned on doing a second encore.  They started taking the shit apart and people were like, uh, and then the guy comes out  and starts plugging shit back in and you're like, oh, yeah, they're back out. 
[00:26:00]  That was probably the encore.  Oh, yeah.  Radiohead gets a little weird.  Yeah.  We'll just unplug instruments as the second encore.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too.  I saw a picture of the set list.  There was no second encore.  No.  So...  Wow.  Yeah, people get set lists, you know.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, I think it was just kind of like, the guy peeled up the set list.  It was done.  They were done.  Yeah, they were done.  You know, I didn't pick up the new album yet.  Is it worth it?  Well, yeah, it's good.  It's not great, but it's good.  It's pretty trippy. 
[00:26:30]  Well, they would say it's great.  They play almost all of it.  They would say it's great.  Sure.  I think it's good, but I would have liked to hear, you know, more old stuff.  No, you're not.  They're one of those frustrating bands.  You're not hearing any old stuff.  I think they're one of those frustrating bands.  But their new stuff is good enough where it's like...  I know, but you just want them to go, can you just play fake plastic trees or something?  You know, they might play it all tonight, because I've seen them like seven times, and they  always play twice in New York.  Yeah.  And the show that I go to is always the one where they don't play Creep and Just and fake 
[00:27:00]  plastic trees.  And then the other night, they play all that shit.  Yeah.  So you might...  Just throw in karma, please.  Just something.  Please.  You're not going to hear that.  No, I understand.  I know.  I understand what Tom York's about.  I've read a million articles on the guy, but...  Tom is a weirdo.  But it's like, how about one for us, Tom?  He likes to dance.  It looks like he's got to make wee-wees, and then he went out on stage and has to make  wee-wees.  People fucking love Radiohead, though, man.  Yeah, it was good.  Don't mess with Radiohead.  He came right up before... 
[00:27:30]  When people were still coming in, he walked right in front of us in the VIP section and  just kind of waved to the crowd a little bit.  Wow.  And it was like, oh, look, he's fucking two feet away.  Should have punched him.  I shouldn't have punched him.  He's a weird guy, man.  I'm the only one that gets that feeling when you see a big celebrity?  Nah, everyone thinks that.  Right?  Yeah, it's like, ah, that'd be funny.  Okay.  Shoot!  Just pop in the face with a fucking fist and just...  I get these weird thoughts, like, I'm just going to fucking blindside tackle Chris  Rock.  I don't know why. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, Chris Rock walked out with the...  Shit, what's his fucking name?  We had him on our show once.  Obviously a forgettable person.  No, it's just...  He was in with Ryan Reynolds.  Oh, really?  Jason Bateman?  Yeah, yeah, Jason Bateman.  Oh, Jason's all right.  Yeah, Jason was walking out with Chris Rock.  Did, um...  Wow, what's that about?  I don't know, man.  A new power fucking duo.  I'm thinking the other way.  I'm seeing a cop movie.  Is there something going on there?  Is there a cop movie? 
[00:28:30]  Oh, no, I just think where they go, holy shit!  In a car, I think that'd be cool.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm getting too old for this shit kind of a thing.  Maybe a remake of Lethal Weapon.  That'd be cool.  Jason Bateman, Chris Rock.  Oh, boy, you're a hipster.  Lethal Weapon?  They're calling you a hipster now.  Why am I a hipster?  Because you're kind of...  You know, you're at a Radiohead show.  Philip Seymour Hoffman's there with the video.  Dude.  Dude.  It was Dusty.  I'm not talking Philip Seymour Hoffman.  I was sitting with Dusty from Twister. 
[00:29:00]  Fucking A!  Woo!  Yeah!  The extreme!  Fucking the extreme!  Dude.  You want me to get out?  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  That's cool.  Yeah, it was fucking cool.  And Cameron Diaz, just a bitch, huh?  What a fucking bitch.  You know, whatever.  You don't want to take a picture with me.  I don't care, but you're a bitch because of it. 
[00:29:30]  Was she taking pictures with other people?  No, of course not.  She was running out of there.  Running the fuck out of there.  I don't understand where it would ever be a drag to take pictures with somebody.  I know, that's just it.  We're lucky enough where we get, you know, asked a lot.  Yeah.  But not on that level.  But I can't imagine we'd ever get to a point where you're like,  oh, fuck, enough of this shit.  And take time to assess the situation.  Look, I wasn't standing there going like,  hey, take a picture and then it would be a big pain in the ass.  I had my arm extended already.  That's why I got a picture of the top of her dopey fucking head.  You made it easy. 
[00:30:00]  Because I had my arm extended.  All I would have to do is go, hey, click, it was done.  Yeah.  You know, it was one of those deals.  But you made it easy for everybody.  What else from the show?  Anything, Travis?  Fucker in the ass.  No, not really.  I mean, the managers, by the way, the two old English blokes are fucking.  Fans of the show?  Awesome.  They're huge fans of the show.  Insane.  Yeah.  I think.  All right, look.  I don't know which one's which.  I don't know names or anything.  I'm just going to say, I heard this rumor that one of them, 
[00:30:30]  well into his 60s, might have been doing mushrooms.  At the show?  I have no idea.  Look, I have no idea.  You're not going to get to go to that after party.  And loves the ladies.  Well.  Oh, boy.  What's wrong with that?  Because I was hanging out, of course.  There were a few ladies around.  Right.  A few very tall, slender, lovely young ladies around.  And this motherfucker, one of them, was up that, just, would not, like, kept going away, but 
[00:31:00]  kept coming back.  Hey, how we doing?  All right.  Little drink for everybody?  Little drink?  Little drink?  Oh, shit.  And then, uh, uh, uh, we're back home at the, at the, at the apartment, and, uh, get a  text.  Hey, where are ya?  No.  Yeah, it's time to fucking party.  But it's not the big party, because they got a show tonight.  Right.  So tonight, uh, is the, the big after show party, which, uh, we better take Friday off.  We better take tomorrow off, Sam.  I'm just telling you right now.  We better take tomorrow off. 
[00:31:30]  Pencil in, uh, uh.  Pencil in no show Friday.  No show Friday.  We better take tomorrow off.  That doesn't sound good.  Let's just call it, we're, we're doing a Howard.  Let's just call it that.  No.  Come on, Howie.  We're not doing a Howard.  He's got a week and a half off.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  He just came back.  Doing a Fred.  How many, how many days did he do in between vacations?  I need to know that answer.  Uh, I, between either six or seven.  Mm.  No.  No? 
[00:32:00]  Really?  I think he's back for two weeks.  He was back for two weeks, and now he's out again for another week and a half.  How does he do that?  I think so.  Amazing.  Oh, that's off.  I think he, all right.  Took off two weeks around Labor Day, and then, you guys got nothing else on the radio ahead?  That was about it.  That was a good show.  It was fun.  I look forward to going at night.  Yeah, you'll have a good time.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Marcos, uh, with the next big story of the day.  Marcos and Yonkers, what's up, buddy?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hello.  Good morning.  I wanted to say, I want to say congratulations to all the Red Sox fans. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, boy.  You got in first place as choke artists this year.  Uh, wow.  Let's, let's, let's, what a meltdown.  Let's summarize this for the, uh, for people like myself that haven't really followed the whole  baseball story at the end of the year.  What happened?  The past month has been tragic for the Sox.  Really?  It's seven and 20.  Yeah.  They went seven and 20?  And 20.  Since September 4th.  Yeah.  Seven and 20.  They were up nine games. 
[00:33:00]  They were up nine games.  On the Rays.  They were up nine games.  November 2nd, yep.  And they had a ninth inning meltdown, uh, against the Orioles.  The Red Sox, the Red Sox were one strike away from winning.  Yeah.  And the Rays were one strike away from losing.  And apparently, uh, it was a base hit.  Uh, and then this guy, Billy Buckner on the Sox, uh, the ball, what?  Oh.  Wow.  Yeah, it was, uh, it was one of those tragic things that you see for a team and for, for 
[00:33:30]  especially Sox fans, because you know how they are.  Right.  To see that happen, I would have loved to have been in a bar in Boston and watched that  fucking game.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  It's unbelievable.  Wow.  Yeah.  And not to mention that, uh, Tampa Bay was playing our, our Yankees triple A team.  We didn't even have the whole team.  The Yankees triple A team.  The Yankees were not obvious.  And, and people like to say, no, they were.  And, uh, even Girardi will get out there after the game and say, no, they give their all. 
[00:34:00]  You know, we're, we're testing people out.  We, we understand that they were not trying cause they don't fucking care.  Then why would you put up seven runs?  Well, I know, but you know, it's just, cause they knew the other, uh, cause it's that easy.  They knew they were going to get eight.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's exactly.  Well, they sure, uh, you know, yeah, it was presumptuous of them, but you know, baseball,  especially there's a problem.  You got the Sox, you know, they, they, they need to win at the end of the year and then they 
[00:34:30]  got to count on teams that don't give a shit anymore.  Yeah.  I think when you're, when you're officially eliminated, you should be able to sit out  the rest of the season.  And then the team, like the Red Sox, that it's really important, get to play just games  against another team that it's really important for.  Where it's not.  You know what I mean?  Cause it's, then teams like the Orioles get to be spoilers.  That's true.  You know?  Yeah, but then you got the Yankees that are putting in.  Oh, boy, where were we?  Oh.  Then you got the Yankees that are putting on, putting in kids cause they, it's not important.  Yeah, but everybody puts in kids in September. 
[00:35:00]  I know, but it makes it suck for some of these teams that really need to.  Maybe the Red Sox shouldn't have lost all those games in April.  Yeah, I guess that's a, that's a good point too.  Cause you can't count on it at the end of the year.  Poor Sox.  Yes, Marcos.  I was going to say, David Ortiz said last night that last night's loss was worse than the  Aaron Boone home run they lost.  I think it was in 2003.  Yeah.  Oh yeah, I remember that one.  I was into the good one.  I was in a hotel in Cleveland when that, when that went down.  That home run was one moment. 
[00:35:30]  This was a month.  True.  Yeah.  Of just watching your life.  Just, right.  Watching time run out.  Yeah.  They just watched time run out on themselves.  Whatever happened to Aaron Boone?  That was it for him.  Yeah, he was like, he does comment, but that was it.  He's a commentator.  That was it.  Well, yeah, he wasn't like.  That was his moment.  But he was like, yeah, he was going to be the big thing.  I don't know what happened to him.  The Red Sox didn't win two games in a row this month.  Wow.  What a collapse.  So who did the Yankees play?  The Yankees played Detroit. 
[00:36:00]  Detroit.  Yeah.  Go Detroit.  And of course, everybody in Detroit is like, hey, fuck you.  It's it.  It's over.  It's like, look, I understand.  You know, you had yourself a good season.  Everyone's feeling good.  But you can never just count out the Yankees.  Hey, look, you might win.  I'm not sitting here going, fuck you.  You look dead.  You know, you're fucked.  But you can't just automatically go, fuck you.  It's the Yankees.  All right.  Please.  What was I going to say?  Magnum. 
[00:36:30]  Is Magnum P.I. all fucking excited?  Yeah.  Aren't the Yankees hurting, though?  No.  No.  No.  What did the paper say today?  It was a headline.  Yankees limping or something.  Blah, blah, blah.  Back page.  Of course.  The sports section.  It might be the other one.  It's the eye on the Tigers.  Okay.  It's the eye on the Tigers.  It's the thrill of the fight.  Yanks limp into ALDS versus Tigers.  Yeah.  What does that mean, then?  I guess because they didn't win, you know, the games after they clinched. 
[00:37:00]  But who gives a shit?  Yeah.  That's a dumb headline because it didn't matter anymore.  It didn't matter.  Collapse versus Rays.  Dooms Bo Sox.  Yes.  You think Bob Kelly's bummed out today?  Dude!  Fuck them.  It's part of being a Sox fan.  You just expect to be fucked over, dude.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Yes, Marcos.  Can I mention one more thing?  And this is not just because I'm a Yankees fan.  See, when the Yankees don't make it to the playoffs, we know. 
[00:37:30]  We know a month before it happens.  We never choke last minute like these a-holes.  Well.  You can curse.  It's okay.  I know I'm driving a school bus, so I have kids on the bus.  I guess.  You'll hear it for us.  There's your bus driver, kids.  Dude, you'll absolutely hear Boston fans say, yes, the Yankees have in the past choked.  You mean like four games in a row?  Yeah.  You remember that one?  Yeah.  But to get into the playoffs, I understand what this guy's saying. 
[00:38:00]  For the most part, you kind of know when the team is feeling weak, when a disaster is right there.  But for a month to fuck up like that?  Wow.  Seven and 20, you said?  Seven and 20.  Holy shit.  That's bad.  It's like they gave up.  Aaron Boone was traded because he tore his ACL playing basketball.  Thank you, Mike and Queens.  Hey, Marcos, thank you.  I'm going to give someone else a shot here, all right?  That old ACL.  Thanks, brother. 
[00:38:30]  It's a tough one.  You got to watch that ACL.  Thank God didn't make that too strong.  No, especially for sports players.  Yeah, for sports players, it's like, ah, we're going to fuck you over with that ACL thing.  He's not made to twist like that too many times.  My kid will never walk onto a school bus.  You're lunatics.  You're lunatics, bus drivers.  What happened?  I was just thinking.  What happened?  Marcos seems like an all right guy, but he's listening to a radio show, wants to curse, 
[00:39:00]  and there's kids in the back.  Fuck that.  He's on his cell phone calling talk radio shows while he's driving the school bus.  He's looking in that big, long mirror, seeing if the kids are being rambunctious.  Marcos is a good guy.  He's a terrible bus driver.  Oh, he's horrible.  I'm going to have to drive my kid to school every day.  There's no way he's getting on a school bus.  Worse than my bus driver, Eddie Spaghetti with the meatball eyes.  Right.  Remember him?  Eddie Spaghetti with the meatball eyes.  When you'd get to walk up the little stairs of your school bus, and Eddie Spaghetti would  turn his head around, and he'd flip his eyelids up and make meatball eyes. 
[00:39:30]  Fuck that.  He was Eddie Spaghetti with the meatball eyes, and he would scare the kids.  Fuck that.  You know what?  And then he'd rape our asses.  Oh, no.  Oh, I forgot about that part.  It just came back to me.  I don't think Marcos is one of these guys, but I'm going to go on the record and say  that 30% of all school bus drivers are on crystal meth.  You think they're meth heads?  Meth heads.  Yeah.  Are they breaking bad?  They're breaking bad.  They're breaking bad.  Meth heads.  Oh, yeah.  I wouldn't doubt it.  30%.  Nick in Jersey. 
[00:40:00]  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  To make it even sweeter, SportsCenter this morning makes a joke about the Red Sox, in  the NL wildcard race, Braves collapsed with like an 8-18 record for the month of September.  And the Cards made it instead of the Braves.  They lost last night.  Yeah, last night was an amazing night for fucking baseball.  The Braves were 10 and a half games up in the end of August.  And they collapsed, too? 
[00:40:30]  And they collapsed, too.  What's going on?  They collapsed.  And they make the joke that the Braves would have had the largest collapse, but Boston  outdid them.  That's how bad they are.  But two major collapses this year.  So who do we got in the playoffs?  It's time to pick my team.  Let's go.  You got the Yankees.  You have...  No, Yankees versus who?  Yankees versus Tigers.  Yeah, so I got the Tigers on that one.  Then you got Rays Rangers.  Two who gives a fuck teams.  But I like the death penalty.  Texas, all the way.  All right. 
[00:41:00]  That's a good reason.  Fuck yeah.  Then there's Philly.  And can we talk about how much I hate Lawrence O'Donnell later?  All right.  He's a fucking twat.  Is he an asshole?  He's trying to make...  He's trying to...  He's going after one of the cops down there in the Occupy Wall Street shit.  And basically...  Oh, the guy that pepper sprayed the chick?  And he's basically fucking up this guy's whole career.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I don't...  I just don't see it that...  You know, his way at all on this. 
[00:41:30]  The cops said it was justified.  The police department looked at it and said,  No, it was justified.  He's trying to get a control of the situation.  So he's walking and spraying at the same time.  Get the fuck away from the spray there.  It looks a little shady the way he did it.  Kind of under his arm.  And then sprayed and walked away.  Tough shit.  Tough shit.  They're trying to get control of the situation.  But I think the penned-in bitches and everybody that was in that little penned-in area that he sprayed,  to me, it looked like they were getting a little unruly as far as doing stuff 
[00:42:00]  when the cops are trying to control a situation outside the fence.  Yeah.  And then one guy just walked by and kind of went,  Hey, get your asses back.  It was barely even a spray.  It was so over-dramatized with that bitch kneeling on the fucking cement going,  She's got her hands up in the air.  Like, fucking, it looked like the scene in Platoon.  Right.  Fucking Willem Dafoe kneeling and getting shot in the back and shit. 
[00:42:30]  Calm down.  You got a little pepper spray in your face.  Who hasn't?  You'll be okay.  When you're trying to rape.  But that's why, I mean, we're in a world now in America where everyone is so goddamn entitled  they can't believe they would possibly be pepper sprayed while protesting.  When you're having this big fucking protest, things happen.  And when you try to equate yourself to Egypt and these Middle Eastern countries  where the youth are uprising and being killed, literally shot. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  And then you get pepper sprayed and you're like, why does this happen?  It's like, really?  How about they crack your head?  How about not even another country?  How about we go back 20 years, 30 years, and you would have gotten your skull cracked open  with a piece of wood?  I'm embarrassed for the youth of America.  They're pussies.  They're representing the youth.  Because that was embarrassing.  It's like, look, man, real shit's going down around the world.  Real protesting.  Where people are getting fucking killed and hit over the head.  Yeah.  And camping out for real.  Do these people even camp out?  Oh, they camp out and sing Kumbaya at night in the park. 
[00:43:30]  But how many?  Not many, right?  They go home.  Most of them go home.  And they come back.  And the cops, meanwhile, you watch all these videos, the cops are like, step back, please.  Thank you.  They told the cops, make sure you say please and thank you.  They're fucking saying please.  But Lawrence O'Donnell, I mean, MSNBC, I can't watch your fucking network anymore.  Between stupid Al fucking Sharpton and Lawrence O'Donnell, who has these creepy ice eyes. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  He looks like a creep.  Douchebag.  And he has no charisma to be on fucking TV.  Look, I fucking hated Keith Olbermann, but he was watchable at least.  At least I can watch and go, God, I fucking hate this guy.  This Lawrence O'Donnell, I don't even want to fucking look at the guy.  He's got these cold, icy eyes.  And he tries to get really tough.  Oh, really?  And it's not really working.  And now he's obsessed with this one officer down there and trying to get him fired. 
[00:44:30]  Leave him alone, you dumb fuck.  Oh, a little Bob Kelly.  Oh, yeah.  Bob Kelly, I'm at JFK with my Boston hat on, taking shit from everyone.  It's not fun.  That is up to the minute.  And Robert Kelly.  How do they know he's from Boston?  And then he goes, all right, move on.  Yeah, yesterday with Tom Sizemore.  Tom Sizemore goes, oh, from Boston.  And Bobby goes, how did you know?  He's got a big Boston Red Sox logo on his hat and still has a Boston accent, but Bobby doesn't think he does. 
[00:45:00]  No, dude, I'm a huge fan of the show, dude.  Okay, start this over.  This Lawrence O'Donnell, man, I'm glad we're finally talking about him.  This guy is a creep.  Go ahead.  Time for tonight's re-rother.  Monday night in this space, I told the story of the police misconduct and police brutality that erupted on Saturday at a peaceful demonstration by the Occupy Wall Street protesters.  We brought this story to a national television audience, complete with video of the police violence. 
[00:45:30]  Good for you.  Police violence.  Police violence.  I love pandemonium.  Yeah, now they're just showing the video.  I love some good pandemonium.  But the video, really, it's really hard to figure out what the fuck's going on.  They're arresting people is what's going on.  Shit!  Shit!  Shit!  Shit!  What are they saying?  Shit!  I don't know. 
[00:46:00]  Holy shit!  Holy shit!  Let him f***!  Let him f***!  Let him f***!  Let him f***!  Let him f***!  Let him break it down!  I see cops trying to get a hold of a situation.  I really do.  And look, now they're taking another guy.  F***!  Right.  They're not just randomly picking people, by the way.  Right.  And now they're taking troublemakers and instigators.  I love the dragging down the street.  That's how you get control of a situation, by the way.  What? 
[00:46:30]  What?  You take the troublemakers and people that are inciting.  They're inciting.  Like, he's playing a montage of videos, and I honestly don't see any problems yet.  Nope.  I really don't.  Here's the lemon screaming.  Like it's Kent State.  Like it's f***ing that, yeah.  She's like Kim Phuc from, uh, is that her name?  Kim Phuc from Vietnam.  We then show you a slow motion version of that last piece of video.  Oh, thank you.  Which revealed a police commander using pepper spray against some young women for absolutely no reason. 
[00:47:00]  It's not absolutely no reason.  This video shot from another angle immediately after that first pepper spray attack.  Let's see.  Let's go, let's go, let's go.  We're here, please.  We're here, please.  We're here, please.  I can't see.  We're not going to slow that down so that you can get a clear view of the white shirt indiscriminate pepper spray attacker.  Yeah, the guy's making some decisions to f***ing control everybody. 
[00:47:30]  It's indiscriminate.  So you got the, is he a lieutenant in it?  Uh, he's a white shirt, so possibly.  Probably.  So the guy's doing what?  What are we looking at?  You're looking at him.  What are we looking at, Lawrence?  You stupid f***.  Him, uh, you know, maybe pepper spraying some f***ing, a f***ing crowd of people that aren't f***ing moving.  I hit it.  We now know his name and rank. 
[00:48:00]  The New York Times has confirmed that the out-of-control officer, the high-ranking deputy inspector, Anthony Bologna,  since our program Monday night, much has changed in the life of Inspector Bologna.  On Monday, the police department was blithely insisting that the use of pepper spray and all of the rest of the brutality caught on tape was appropriate,  even while they knew that we and anyone with internet access had video proving that it was completely unjust. 
[00:48:30]  City Councilman Peter Vallone, the chairman of the city council's public safety committee.  I mean, it's a really long clip.  I mean, what do you want to do with this?  It's f***ing, you know what, they're trying to make this guy, hold this guy up as the, you know,  the image of the abusive NYPD who's cracking down a, nothing, a pepper spraying?  F***ing shut up, it happens all the time.  It's called crowd control. 
[00:49:00]  If you want to protest and you're in a crowd and the police are telling you to f***ing move,  first of all, you know what, they're trying to keep a city moving and working.  And if there's people in the street, they've got to be put off the f***ing street.  And they were moving these fences around, getting people off the f***ing street.  And they're telling them, get on the sidewalk.  Well, I mean, and if you're going to protest, some s***'s going to go down.  You've got to expect it.  You can't cry like a little baby.  The city has to keep moving.  If you're going to protest and push it, some s***'s going to go down. 
[00:49:30]  A protest in and of itself.  What you're doing is interfering with the workings of something.  Because that's the only way a protest works.  If it doesn't interfere with something, then you're not inconveniencing somebody.  And no one's noticing you.  And you're not really putting a monkey wrench into the cog.  But when you do, the courage and bravery that a protester is supposed to have comes in the fact that you're willing to accept the fact that things like this happen. 
[00:50:00]  Of course.  Now, in the old days, it was a f***ing nightstick across your teeth.  It was f***ing really getting your head rammed into a brick wall.  It wasn't please and thank you.  And in other countries, it's a bullet in your f***ing head.  Or your friend's head exploding next to you.  And having blood on your hands.  Of trying to cradle a dying friend's head.  These pussies and this asshole on MSNBC really have lost sight of what all that's about. 
[00:50:30]  And I praise the NYPD for being as understanding and respectful as they have been over the past...  How long have these idiots been tying up Wall Street?  A couple weeks, maybe.  Yeah.  Go home!  Larry, what's up?  Larry!  Hey, guys, what's going on?  How you doing?  Good, brother.  I'm retired from the job.  Yeah.  Retired from the job.  I worked with Inspector Bologna there.  You know, Tony Bologna.  Tony Bologna. 
[00:51:00]  Hey, Tony Bologna!  Yeah.  Nah, good man, good boss.  The whole thing with this protest...  These people marched from Wall Street up to Union Square.  Yeah.  It was an unauthorized protest.  They were fine when they stayed in the park down there.  Right.  So what happened was, when they wouldn't leave the street, that's what you do.  Like Anthony said, back in the day, I go back to... on a job in the 80s...  Oh, boy.  Fun.  You guys know that you went in there with the nice sticks and you broke head.  Today, you can't break head.  Because everyone's got the cameras. 
[00:51:30]  Yep.  They all got cameras.  Well, Thompson Square Park killed us after with the cameras.  The second they start trying to arrest people, the crowd starts chanting, the world is watching.  The world is watching.  Oh, of course.  And they get their cameras out, and they're videoing everything.  And meanwhile, the cops are arresting people.  They have to drag them out of the crowd, first of all.  You can't start arresting someone in the middle of a crowd.  First of all, cops don't do that.  They got to get the guy away from the crowd so they don't jeopardize their own lives. 
[00:52:00]  Exactly.  Of course, they don't show the crowd punching and kicking at the cops.  Of course.  Right.  That's why the cops are getting them away, and they're going to drag them.  And then you get people going, oh, you could take...  Why do you have your knee on his neck?  Because the guy's fucking resisting.  Because he's trying to turn over.  Because we're in the middle of a protest situation.  Yeah.  You're the protesters, and we're trying to control the situation.  That's why.  Right.  I don't even mind.  I got to go on record. 
[00:52:30]  I don't even mind that the younger people are protesting.  Yeah, I don't even care about that.  I kind of like that.  I kind of like when people protest against the machine man.  But what bothers me, and this is where I'm on the same page as Anthony, is how fucking  wimpy these kids are, because it's a me-me generation, and these kids today, they're  so fucking entitled that they don't get it.  Exactly.  If you're going to protest, some of you are going to get your fucking skulls cracked in.  What happens?  Opie, Opie, the minute you turn around and take a knife stick out, or the minute you turn 
[00:53:00]  around and take the mace out, all of a sudden, you see, you get your diehard.  But they want to get it.  Right.  They want it.  You see the rest of them?  They all start backing away.  Oh, not me, not me.  Well, Larry, I was saying this from the start.  What these protesters want is a situation where they're being hit or pepper sprayed because  all their cameras are out, and they want it, and they're inciting it.  They are trying their hardest. 
[00:53:30]  And the fact that there hasn't been more instances shows the amount of restraint that  the NYPD has with these kids.  Exactly.  Listen, it goes back to the incident back in the early 80s in Borough Park in the 66th  Precinct.  And Borough Park, back then, primarily Jewish.  And the Jewish people stormed the precinct and took the precinct over.  Oy vey.  All right?  And what they did was, the big bosses turned around to that and let them go. 
[00:54:00]  They're blowing off steam.  And after the whole thing was over, a black cop that was on the scene told a report in  the Daily News.  He said, if this was a black neighborhood, there'd be black bodies laying on the floor.  That's the problem with this city.  They let these certain people get away with shit.  Look at you, see?  The years have been going on.  Yeah.  Turn around and God forbid you do your job.  You can't even do your job anymore.  No, no, no.  You can't even take care of a summons anymore. 
[00:54:30]  You can't take care of a summons.  You can't do anything.  I know some cops that are very close to retirement.  And a lot of times when a cop gets close to retirement, they consider, you know, should  I put in a few more years or something, they are grabbing what their pension is and running  because there's too much at risk.  You're risking too much staying on the job now.  You might as well take your pension, leave and actually go, whew, I made it out without  fucking getting, losing my pension or God forbid getting arrested. 
[00:55:00]  These days, we're not letting the police do their job because we're waiting to get a  YouTube video or a lawsuit or trying to get some guy thrown off the fucking force.  And, you know, it comes back because you don't get the amount of protection that you  were getting when they were allowed to do the job.  Exactly right, Anthony.  All right.  Yeah.  I get my friend.  All right there, Larry.  All right, guys.  Thank you very much.  All right, brother. 
[00:55:30]  Larry made it.  Larry made it out.  Yeah.  So the ballpoint is simple.  Lawrence O'Donnell is creepy and not easy to watch with his fucking icy cold eyes.  Reverend O'Donnell sucks.  Reverend O'Donnell's a douche.  And I kind of, I took a peek at MSNBC.  Not so much these days.  I just, those two especially, I cannot fucking watch at all.  When they say lean forward as their little motto now, it's like, stop it.  You lean left.  You lean so hard left.  As far as, you know, Fox leans right. 
[00:56:00]  MSNBC is trying to be like this.  That's their answer to fair and balanced.  Like Fox is fair and balanced and you know Fox leans right.  But they're both wrong.  Yeah.  They're both really wrong.  I know you're a Fox guy, but they're both wrong.  They weigh each other out.  They're both wrong.  When Hattie told us what he said, he's not a Republican, he's a moderate or something.  I'm like, what?  No, he's a fucking Christian Republican.  Of course.  Which I don't care.  Fine.  I know, but he said that on our show.  I'm like, no, just be what you are.  You're absolutely a right wing Republican.  One thing I do see on Fox that I rarely see on MSNBC, though, is Fox will, like Bill O'Reilly, 
[00:56:30]  will have a left-leaning liberal motherfucker on there.  And actually have a discussion with the person.  Let them get their points out.  It's too bad he's a douche.  But MSNBC, you will rarely see them even allow anyone from the right to talk without first  prefacing it as, here comes a lunatic that we got on. 
[00:57:00]  Look out.  Right.  You know?  And so when they say lean forward, it's so insulting.  It's like, no, we see what you do.  We see what all the news does.  You know, especially mainstream media is left-leaning.  And MSNBC could be one of the most left-leaning news agencies around.  And to say that they, you know, lean forward?  Shut up.  Well, more importantly, I don't know who's in control over there, but they're making horrible  decisions.  I can't imagine anyone's watching Lawrence O'Donnell. 
[00:57:30]  No.  I mean, and they, you know, they basically kicked Keith Overman out the door.  Yeah.  Who was very animated.  I didn't agree with Keith.  I kind of like watching because it was like, it was crazy TV, basically.  Unfortunately for him, you were the only one watching, and that's why they got rid of  him because the ratings are not there.  But that's the point I'm making.  They replace him with Lawrence O'Donnell, and he's supposed to get the ratings?  He sucks.  I know.  That's just it.  This guy is really creepy.  Watch him for a half hour.  Yeah.  With those icy cold, I might have killed someone in my past eyes. 
[00:58:00]  Black eyes, lifeless eyes, like a doll's eyes.  And then you got stupid Reverend Al on there now.  Yeah.  Like, who's making these decisions?  Talk about alienating people.  I think so.  You're even alienating the left.  People on the left don't like Reverend Al.  He's a lying sack of shit from the Tawana Brawley thing.  I think so.  He's an instigator.  He's a race baiter.  He's terrible.  And stop at the scowl, Reverend Al.  Oh, you're angry today.  He's always outraged.  Enough of your stupid fucking scowl.  You're on TV. 
[00:58:30]  Why don't you just smile every once in a while?  There.  Free advice.  Pay me.  Reverend Al is always outraged.  Always scowling.  You think he scowls when he uses that money from his fucking coalition to buy those nice  suits?  I don't know.  You think he scowls?  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Take in the waist.  I lost some weight.  Fucking enough with the scowl.  Look at me.  I've been working out.  I'm a size 42.  I'm huge.  Right.  The best.  He's always in like, look, there's the scowl.  Google image, Reverend Al.  Look at the scowl. 
[00:59:00]  Scowl.  Just Google image, Reverend Al.  I want the whole first page.  I will bet there's not one picture of him smiling.  Wow.  Everything has to be some kind of a scowl.  He is outraged.  I am outraged at my outrage.  Look at this.  Look at these fucking stupid faces this guy makes.  I am literally looking at myself in the mirror, and I am outraged at the amount of rage that  is out in my rage.  What'd I just say?  What'd I just say?  Even with Obama. 
[00:59:30]  Click on the Obama picture when they were eating fried chicken together.  I have a perma scowl.  That's what it is.  Look at that.  Look.  You're with the president, you asshole.  Stop scowling.  I'm with the president, and I'm outraged.  He's eating fried chicken.  He's sending us back years.  It looks like someone threw a pebble into his forehead, and it's now rippling toward  his eyebrows.  Right?  I need Botox.  How many lines does he have when he scowls up there?  I don't know. 
[01:00:00]  I get a new one each year like a tree.  You can tell how many years I've been outraged.  Just count my wrinkles on my forehead.  I've been outraged for 35 years.  Even when he tries to smile in these Google image pictures, it's really hard for him.  I need to get fat again.  Look at that fucking...  If I get fat again, it will fill the ridges in my head.  I look like a Klingon.  I got head ridges like a Klingon.  Top Gun.  Canada.  Reverend Scowl.  Reverend Scowl. 
[01:00:30]  Reverend Scowl.  They call me Reverend Scowl.  Jesus.  Enough already.  My God.  What have I done?  You're on TV, man.  Make it a little more comfortable for people watching.  Enough with the scowl.  Why am I so angry?  Even when he's giving a thumbs up, he's at some kind of Viacom event.  I'm looking at a picture.  Yeah.  And he still has all those ridges on his head.  He can't help himself.  Oh, man.  I need to tie me a tight ponytail on the back of my head to get rid of my Klingon forehead. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, speaking of politics, did you, uh, this, this hit yesterday.  I think it was a good old, uh, puddle of AIDS.  Uh, I think.  Was this on Ted Williams head?  It might've been.  Dot.  What?  What does he got?  Tedwilliamshead.com.  Yeah.  Even if I didn't see it there, I mean, that's a, he does a good job, but there's a little  sight there.  Uh, a little, uh, council, uh, roll call.  Yeah.  Did you see this yet?  I haven't seen this one. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, it's fucking funny, man.  Go on.  Highlands.org.  Thank you.  Free public promotion there.  Uh, Mike Hunt.  Mike Hunt.  No.  Mike Hunt in the audience.  No.  Michael Hunt.  It says Mike Hunt here.  Not here.  Dr. Tom Williams.  Dr. Williams.  Followed by Henry Marine.  The video itself sucks.  No way.  It's kind of one of those like C-span type shots where they just kind of show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big, big, uh, long view. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  And then, you know, the guy's doing his roll call and, uh, I guess, uh, Mike Hunt.  Mike Hunt.  Who would fall for that?  That goes to show you these guys have no clue what's going on in the real world.  Because anyone that has any sense of humor, that's heard a joke in their life, that hangs  out with funny people, they heard that fucking years ago.  Sally Kramer?  The fucking guy actually said Mike Hunt. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I had the video somewhere.  I'll try to tweet it.  I thought I saved it, but I don't know.  Hey, um, Phil McCracken.  Phil McCracken.  You hear what, uh, the Mets did with Reyes?  Jose Reyes?  Where's Travis?  What they did?  He's got a chance at the batting title, so, uh, you know, after he, uh, bunted for a  single in the first inning, no one bunts in the first inning ever. 
[01:03:00]  Ever.  There's no reason to bunt in the first inning ever.  Ever?  Oh, can you send me that link?  I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll tweak that shit.  Mike Hunt prank at LA City Council.  Good one for Mike Hunt.  Travis, you know, uh, way more about baseball than me, but, uh, this, this, uh, was brought  to my attention, this Jose Reyes.  So he bunts in the first inning.  Yeah.  Well, this is his idea.  Why did he bunt?  Because he's just a piece of shit.  Um, he was, was there a reason for bunting?  Well, yeah.  I mean, he's a fast guy.  Like he lays down a bunt. 
[01:03:30]  Chances are, he's going to, he's going to get a base hit.  Run it, run that out.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Uh, so I guess he, he went to, uh, to the manager there.  Uh, he went?  Yeah.  Oh, that's even more embarrassing.  And, uh, and said, Hey, I want to, I want to, you know, try and get a hit and then,  and then take me out to, uh, to preserve my chances of winning the batting title.  Uh-huh.  Because it was between him and Ryan Braun on, uh, Milwaukee.  Right.  So he gets a base hit, ups his average a little bit, immediately gets taken out of the game.  You know, you, you don't want to play the whole game and, and, you know, be a man like 
[01:04:00]  Ted Williams used to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone's talking about Ted Williams.  Well, when Ted Williams batted over 400, he had the opportunity to not play those games.  Right.  He was already at 400, but he said, fuck that.  I'm still playing.  Yeah.  And, and he played those games.  That's a man.  There's not.  The man would have frozen head.  There's not many men in this world these days.  Men.  There really isn't.  Manly men.  Ronnie B's a man.  Of course.  There's a short list of men at this point.  A smoking man.  That's right.  Not only, so, so not only does he, does he take himself out of the game to, to increase 
[01:04:30]  his chances of winning a batting title.  It's the Mets last game at home.  It's probably his last game as a Met.  Mm-hmm.  Because he's a free agent and he had a great season.  And, um, unless the Mets throw a ton of money at him, this is it.  Okay.  And he was a homegrown player, you know?  So, a lot of fans come out to, you know, to see him play.  Yeah, he came up in the weeds and all that.  Isn't the whole thing, like, you have to play the game and that's, if, if you get a high 
[01:05:00]  average, it's because you played the game?  Well, it depends on how many at-bats you have.  Yeah, I know.  That's just it.  It's like.  So, you know, yesterday he had one at-bat and he had one at-bat.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  So, but he, a bunch, single, and then he's asked to get taken out of the game.  So then Ryan Braun.  That is embarrassing.  Take me out, coach.  I don't want to play.  I mean, at least fake it.  Make believe you want to stay in and, you know, they take him out.  He's like, oh, come on.  Yeah.  I want to stay in.  Bah! 
[01:05:30]  But not go to the fucking coach and say, yank me.  Take me out of here.  How do they handle that?  Get me out of here.  The fans.  Oh, they booed the shit out of him.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Because I'm not a huge Mets fan these days.  Good for them.  Good.  Good for you guys.  And then he ended up winning the batting title because Ryan Braun went 0 for 4.  So he had to go 3 for 4 to win it.  Oh, boy.  So, okay.  So let's say Reyes stayed in and went 1 for 4.  Then what would have happened?  He probably, well, he would have won, yeah.  Still would have won.  Because Braun went 0 for 4. 
[01:06:00]  Ah, what a fucking lame-ass move that is.  Like you said, Ted Williams didn't do that shit.  Yeah.  No.  Ted Williams was a true man.  First met to win a batting title.  Who cares?  Not me.  I'm not a Mets fan.  I don't give a fuck.  Especially if it's done that way.  I don't give a fuck.  Jesus.  Want to hear the Mike Hunt again?  Please.  As we go to break?  Please.  Can I just say, walking down the hallway, your studio is incredibly yellow.  Yeah, yeah.  Your eyes adjust to it.  We're used to it now.  You really do. 
[01:06:30]  Like if you walk out to go to the bathroom during the break, and you come back in here,  you're going to be, it's unbelievable how yellow it is.  We're fucking up our cones and rods.  Yeah.  I know I reached my bitch quota yesterday.  That's why I'm trying to be cool today.  Yeah.  I'm trying.  I feel like I have a yellow legal pad here, but it's white paper.  No, everything's white now in here.  I don't even see yellow anymore.  I'm going to be going through lights like crazy today.  Yeah.  I'm going to drive and be like, hey, that went from green to red.  What the fuck happened?  I don't know.  What does this new white light mean?  I don't know what that even means. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  That's great.  I'm eating white French fries.  What happened?  Yeah.  Everyone can heat up their lunches in here, I guess, later on today.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Just leave it all under the heat lamp.  Sure.  That sandwich of yours is nice and hot.  It still is.  It's a melt.  It's great.  All right.  We're going to break.  Patrice O'Neal coming in.  Jimmy's in Tampa.  Let's not forget.  Tampa Improv, I believe.  Yes.  Starting tonight.  It's going to be on Cowhead's show.  I think so.  Today, tomorrow, both days probably.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Do you know, I used to get excited when I would see that we made Google News. 
[01:07:30]  I'd see a Google News thing come up and be like, oh, cool.  Yeah.  Google News.  Yeah.  And I'd click and be like, Opie and Anthony did this or that or we're fired or something.  Yeah.  Now, not so much when in two days, the likes of Travis made the Google News and then the  likes of Sam Roberts made it yesterday with an incredible interview from the shit hour  with some wrestler guy. 
[01:08:00]  Zack Ryder.  Zack, of course.  I don't know who Zack Ryder is.  You know it.  He's a Long Island guy, right?  Yeah.  Take care.  Spike your hair.  You might as well be speaking French.  I have no idea.  I wish he was.  I wouldn't understand this.  I have no idea what this is.  Yeah.  Long Island, I-Z.  I-Z.  See, Long Island, I-Z.  That's right.  And he made, so I see Google News and I'm like, okay, I got an alert.  It must be an Opie and Anthony story.  No.  The other day, I see Travis in the Huffington Post because he got Radiohead tickets.  And then yesterday, I'm like, oh, what's this one? 
[01:08:30]  Clay.  Like, oh, Sam Roberts from the after, and it says the after show.  Like, it's a fucking real show.  It is.  Stop it.  It's a joke.  He tried to make it a joke, but I flipped the switch.  I don't know what happened.  I know what's happening.  Wasn't that a goof?  I know what's happening.  I thought they were being taken over.  Oh, God.  By the youngins.  They figured that they could just pop him in on our shift and pay him nothing, and  he'll do fucking five hours.  Woo-woo-woo.  Woo-woo-woo.  The youngins.  Yep.  The kids.  The kids today taking over. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You serious, bro?  Oh, shit.  Is that another catchphrase?  Yeah.  Is that another?  Yeah.  Yes.  And this is in the 10 o'clock hour, huh?  What was the big...  You're going to force us to go to 11 again.  Yeah, I know.  You know that, right?  I'm getting press.  You're going to force us.  I'm getting Google alerts.  If this turns into a wrestling show, we're going to have to take the fucking hour back.  I'm getting Google alerts.  So, WWE star Zach Ryder spoke with Sam Roberts on After Opie and Anthony Live.  There you go.  It's the name...  It's like the name of something.  Yeah.  It's like it's a real show. 
[01:09:30]  What happened?  No.  It's the shit hour.  What happened?  No.  It was a clip show.  How are you getting press on a clip show?  Wait till you hear when we get sponsored next week.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  It better be from a toilet brush.  Nope.  No, sir.  Wait till you hear what's coming next.  Oh, I can only imagine.  Oh, God, no.  That's fair.  You know, if any of this leads up to us taking some time off, though, I'm all for it.  So, whatever.  Let's just put it this way.  You're not going to be able to take the show off until at least December. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, really?  That's right.  What?  Oh, hey, you got a block, huh?  Well, sales is now involved.  Why wouldn't they be?  They don't sell this show.  Why are they selling your show?  They're trying.  Oh, you're going to be doing some live reads.  Possibly.  Sam Roberts on the live read.  What is going on?  That's good.  Good.  Then you can do them all, motherfucker.  I think you have been.  I've been darting out of here so quickly.  Sam hands me a piece of copy at the end of the show and goes, no, you got to do this  first.  I'm like, yeah, right. 
[01:10:30]  I run out with my fucking thing to the elevator.  I believe your response is, no, you got to do this.  You do it.  And then I go to my truck and I turn on the radio and I hear Sam doing a read.  Perfect.  That's great.  That's perfect.  It's perfect.  By the way, when Monday hits.  Yeah.  Less than a year left.  Oh, is that official?  The countdown officially begins.  Get your countdown clocks programmed and start them up on Monday.  Seven years?  Our seven year anniversary is Monday, too.  Oh.  I hope there's a lot of presents coming in the mail.  Shit.  You know what else starts on Monday? 
[01:11:00]  What?  What?  Jock-tober.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, kid.  Thank God.  I'm looking forward to that.  Thank God.  You got some good ones?  Oh, yes.  And some old faves?  Old faves, good ones.  A lot of listener requests already coming in like crazy.  I just got it.  I just got it.  Look, I'm not being a spoiler here, but I got to know.  Scott and Todd.  Is it Jock-tober without Scott and Todd?  No, it isn't.  Scott and Todd.  John and Jeff.  It's like asking if Santa's going to come in.  Oh, God, no.  Please, not John and Jeff. 
[01:11:30]  The only reason I come in in October is because one of those days we're going to be playing  John and Jeff.  It's worth coming in the whole month.  Yes.  Just on the off chance at that day.  We're two guys.  Who knows?  We're two guys.  We're two guys who think.  No, you're not.  We think if we do a promo like this, people will think we're men.  We're two guys.  Everybody thinks it'll be the last day.  Maybe I'll throw it in the middle of the month.  John and Jeff all of a sudden.  That's how you roll.  Tune in every day.  We got a break.  We got Patrice O'Neill coming in.  Big Mama Prods on the Twitter.  Nice.  Louis Black.  Holy shit. 
[01:12:00]  He's coming in?  That's cool.  He hasn't been in a while.  I thought he forgot about us.  You know what?  A lot of world issues going on.  I like discussing things with Louis.  You'd think it was the real person.  That's my new impression.  That's perfect.  I think I got it.  You got that down.  And ladies and gentlemen, he's pointing.  Yeah.  Well, you have to.  You got to.  You got to get into it.  You got a point.  Wow.  That's pretty good, right?  That was pretty good. 
[01:12:30]  That's good.  Working on my impressions for my new career.  Sounds like a gunga.  Once again, Mike Hunt as we go to break.  From what?  Some kind of council roll call in L.A.  We'll tweet the video somehow, some way, in a minute or two.  Stay there.  Highlands.org.  Thank you.  Free public promotion there.  Mike Hunt.  Mike Hunt.  Mike Hunt in the audience.  Michael Hunt.  It says Mike Hunt here.  Not here.  Dr. Tom Williams. 
[01:13:00]  Dr. Williams.  Followed by Henry Marine.  I'll tell you what the best hour of every show is.  10 o'clock.  10 o'clock.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate you.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P.  Anthony Show.  Oh, Dice is 54 today? 
[01:13:30]  What?  That's what it says here.  What?  No way.  What?  Older?  Fuck yes.  I ain't buying that shit.  No, man.  He hit early.  I think he's only 54.  No way.  Yep.  He hit early, man.  Real early.  I cannot.  I cannot accept that.  I think that's about right. 
[01:14:00]  You know that Willie Mays thing where he caught the ball?  They call it the catch.  Yeah.  57 years ago.  Wow.  Remember when those guys died from the Tylenol thing?  Oh, yeah.  With the cyanide?  Yeah.  Seven people?  That's 29 years ago already.  No fucking way.  You're saying that's like 30 years.  Might as well be.  Yeah.  30 years.  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Nancy Gray's still fucking denying the nip slip. 
[01:14:30]  Stop it.  It wasn't a pasty.  It wasn't some fucking broth thing.  It was your tit.  Listen, you stupid pig.  That was your big, fat fucking brown nipple.  Big, nasty teat.  Yeah.  Where you suckle piglets.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We have a South African radio news anchor.  Oh.  Mark Esther Huytsin gets fired because of an F-bomb filled rant.  This is a big one today.  For radio?  Yeah.  I guess they got an FCC in South Africa? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Yeah, they don't like your color, but don't say fuck on the radio.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Bam, bam, bam.  I like that song.  Yeah.  Can I see the Nancy Grace thing again?  Oh, yeah.  A little scoffing.  How is she saying this isn't her big, stupid brown nipple?  It is.  It's the areola, and it's actually the nipple part.  It's the areola.  It's got the nipple poking out.  That's the nipple poking out.  Of course it is.  Because a lot of people like to say the nipple's the whole fucking thing, but you got the areola,  and then you got the part you suck is the nipple. 
[01:15:30]  It's big and brown, because she's fucking, has she suckled any children?  How many children has she suckled?  I fucking hate her nostrils.  It drives me nuts.  It really is horrid.  Those horrendous fucking nostrils.  Oh, God.  You know who has bad nostrils?  Who's that?  I better not say.  Turn the fucking mic down.  Tell me.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:16:00]  What?  We didn't need music.  That's okay.  Yeah, that probably wouldn't watch.  But those people do.  Yeah, they do.  And I'm not talking.  In person.  No, I'm not.  No.  Believe it or not, I'm not.  No.  I'm not.  It's when the nostril has that too much shit going on on the side that drives me.  You got a lot of side nostrils.  Like Mr. Burns.  Yeah, yeah.  Shit.  Yeah.  I was getting my her did yesterday.  How's that?  Well, the chick shampooing. 
[01:16:30]  She was a stocky little thing.  And as she was leaning over, she was breathing out her nostrils.  And I felt like the air hitting my face.  So I had to time my breathing out of my mouth.  Like I was swimming.  I would go like out of the side of my mouth when she wasn't breathing out on me.  Because it was just creeping me out.  Like her exhaling through these.  And believe me, she had some big ass nostrils.  Hold on, hold on. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  What happened?  Holy shit.  What?  I certainly hope.  What?  That those microphones are off.  I heard it.  Because that would cost us quite a bit.  Hopefully our jobs.  Yeah.  I got to admit, that would cost us our jobs.  Hopefully.  Wowie kazowie.  That sounds like something I'd say on the drive home.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Just trying to be your friend.  I'm sorry.  Well, it works.  I figured that's a good one.  I figured that's the weight of your heart.  It really is.  All right.  Good.  Yeah.  Good.  Good.  So yes, by the way.  Yes.  The answer is yes.  And the hot breath coming out of the nose was hitting my face.  Like hard.  Like.  And I was timing my breath.  Through my mouth.  You guys had to work together.  Yes.  It was weird.  You breathe.  I'll hold my breath.  My turn. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Because I did not want to smell what was coming out of that nose.  It was weird.  It was freaking me out.  You know, we were talking about it.  I don't think it made the air yesterday, but some of these shampoo broads.  Yeah.  I'm convinced they're doing handies on the side.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I go to nice places, but they're there now.  It went from shampooing to they're pretty much massaging the top half of your body.  Yeah.  There's something going on.  And then they use their fingers in a way like, oh, I see.  Dude.  This stubby girl, like I was talking about yesterday, did this thing. 
[01:18:30]  She went through the whole rigmarole.  And then during the last fucking thing that they put in the hair and go to fucking shampoo,  she did this thing where she's really massaging like my skull.  Yeah.  And then she's working her way up toward the top of my head.  And all I could think is like, that's what she does to a cock.  Like the way she was working her hands.  Right.  Was like, that's what she does to a dick.  She like grabs it with both hands and like moves up.  And makes a sand cap.  She was giving a fucking dick hand job to the top of my head. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  But somewhere up there, there's a connection between that and your wiener.  Because every once in a while, you'll feel your wiener move.  You're like, what?  Is it like when you go over a dip in the road in your car?  Do you just feel that feeling?  Way down there?  Yeah, yeah.  That wiener feeling.  Whatever muscle that is.  It's the wiener muscle.  I think it's connected to the wiener, but way deep inside.  Why does that happen when you're in your car?  I don't know, man.  You go on a big whoop-dee-doo dip.  Right.  And you get a feeling in your wiener. 
[01:19:30]  And the next thing you know, you're spilling jizz.  And mommy and daddy are singing to the carpenters.  Well, let me tell you.  It's never gone that far with me, Ope.  No, I'm just saying.  I've heard.  Oh.  And do girls get the wiener feeling in the car dip?  I don't know.  Because the guys, I know, you know, I don't know.  Do girls get the wiener tingle?  No, because they just got like a hole there where our inner wiener is.  Where our inner wiener is.  It's just a hole, so there's nowhere to get the feeling. 
[01:20:00]  Our inner wiener is like, I'm not, look, my dick's way down here, but it's somewhere  like below the belly button, way in here.  It's there.  It gives you this wiener feeling when you go like on a whoop-dee-doo.  Yeah.  But the girl doesn't get it?  I don't know.  I don't think they do.  Why hasn't anyone ever asked this question?  I don't think they do.  Dr. Steve, text me.  What is the wiener feeling on a whoop-dee-doo, and do girls get it?  Very good.  We need the answer.  I need the answer.  Yes, we do.  Yoo-hoo Rocket from Jersey. 
[01:20:30]  Don't bring up the Yoo-hoo thing again.  Oh, my God.  It gets a lot of people upset.  I know the nostrils, you mean, nope.  It's like looking at the roof of a house from the side.  You're looking up an eave.  You're looking up the eave.  I'm fucking not into nostrils these days.  Yeah.  Because of stupid Nancy Grace.  Imagine what it looks like when she's out in the cold.  Yeah.  And it's just like wet.  You can see the wetness.  There's a piggy nose where this part is pushed up a little bit. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It looks like they're just constantly making that pig face.  Yeah.  And then it's this one where it's pushed up to the side too much.  Yeah, and you can see a lot of septum.  Not good.  You see a lot of septum.  Here's the South African radio news anchor.  Mark Blah Blah gets fired because of an F-bomb-filled rant.  This should be good.  This is Eyewitness News.  Good morning.  I'm Mark Estreisen. 
[01:21:30]  Fuck racism.  Fuck the pigs who killed Andres Dantane.  Fuck the avia beer.  Fuck racism.  We are all wild animals meant to live free.  Fuck capitalism.  Fuck fascism.  Fuck this fucking wage slavery graveyard shit.  Fuck domestication.  Fuck Malema.  Fuck the state.  Fuck perpetual economic growth on a finite planet.  This is the only fucking planet we have.  If you don't agree with me, please see my blog.  MarkEstahisen.blogspot.com.  Peace, love, respect, and hockey.  Follow me on Twitter.  MarkEstahisen.  You can see me on Facebook as well. 
[01:22:00]  MarkEstahisen.  Wow.  He knew.  Too bad this is satellite radio.  We do that same rant.  They're like, yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah.  He knew he was jumping on a fucking grenade.  He knew it.  He wanted to get fired.  He wanted out.  Talk radio station in South Africa booted one of its newsreaders Tuesday after he spat out the F-word more than a dozen times.  This is an on-air rant that you just heard, obviously.  This guy, Mark, slammed racism, cops, capitalism, fascism during his 41-second diatribe.  I like diatribes. 
[01:22:30]  At 1 a.m. on talk radio, 702 Eyewitness News.  Hi.  Johannesburg.  Johannesburg.  Good morning, Johannesburg.  How are you doing?  Fuck, fuck, any fuck, fuck.  I guess it's because this guy was killed in April after being brutally beaten by police at a protest.  Shock chocks.  Hey, man, it goes back to the protest thing.  See, real shit's going on with protesters elsewhere.  That's the real deal.  Not a little fucking pepper spray to your eyes.  No.  We can't tolerate that kind of behavior. 
[01:23:00]  That's, no, we can't.  Oh, meaning the guy saying fuck everything, not the fact that a guy died at a protest.  Yeah, yeah.  We can't tolerate that kind of behavior, meaning the radio hoes.  How could you fucking give a shit if he says fuck, fuck, fuck cares?  Yeah.  What's so bad about hearing that?  I would listen to the fuck, fuck newsreader every day.  Why wouldn't you?  If John Montone was just fuck potholes.  Oh, I know.  Or whatever he's into these days. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  I'd listen to that.  Oh, my God.  Especially on regular radio.  That fucking beetle wig has to go.  What are you talking about?  Oh, Ken Burns.  Ken Burns makes some really great documentaries.  Not so much now that we could all do it on iMovie.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they call it the Ken Burns effect.  Dude, I'm doing Ken Burns shit.  You're doing the Ken Burns effect.  I just started this real shit.  You could take your still picture.  Well, the Civil War really put him over the top.  Not that impressive anymore.  The Civil War documentary. 
[01:24:00]  Because he was, you know, there's not much video from the Civil War.  Right.  So he had to use still pictures.  Yeah.  But give them emotion.  Make them move.  Right.  So he was able to pan and pull back and push in on a still picture and kind of reveal what  was happening around.  And it's known now as the Ken Burns effect that you could do.  But how about the effect of that wig on his head?  He got he asked for the Paul McCartney effect because he's got a horrid Beatles wig. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, he does.  It's more Bay City Rollers.  You think Bay City Rollers?  I don't mean to correct you, sir, but I think it's more Bay City Rollers than Beatles.  Let's go Bay City Rollers.  Bay City Rollers with a little more needs a little more poof on top.  Well, let's take a look.  I might be wrong.  I think that needs a little more poof.  Oh, shit.  On top.  You know what?  I am wrong.  But that's an old style Paul McCartney Beatle wig, I think.  Look at old Paul McCartney picture, like Paul McCartney circa 60s. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah.  Now, right there.  Yeah.  That is the look.  Look, look.  Ken Burns head.  Yeah.  Paul McCartney's head.  Wow.  It's the same thing.  I know.  He's wearing it a little longer in the back than Paul did.  But let's just hold him down and yank his hair out.  Wouldn't that be great?  And document it.  And document it.  We'll just fucking put the Ken Burns effect.  Yes, with the Ken Burns effect as we rip his wig off. 
[01:25:30]  Is there a wig, you think?  Oh, that is such a wig.  Oh, that is a wig.  Look, it's got a seam on top.  His part is literally a seam where they have stitched a hair.  You sure?  Posi-traction.  Huh.  That is a wig.  Look at his part.  No one has that hair.  It's not supposed to be that dark if he's that old.  Yeah.  There's a point where you've got to give up on the medicine.  The hair medicine.  Yeah.  There is a point.  Yeah, there's a point.  Where you've got to let a little distinguished gray show through. 
[01:26:00]  That's what we tell ourselves.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I'm dying from within.  Great.  Here, world.  Here's my dying.  Show's experience.  What?  Show's experience.  Get the...  I'm not a fucking mountain gorilla.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  They could get away with that shit, haven't they?  Oh, shit.  The graybacks or whatever they're called?  Silverback.  Oh, yeah.  The silverback gorilla.  That's something you don't want to fuck with.  No.  They're fucking mean. 
[01:26:30]  But when it's a human being with gray hair, very easy target.  Those things are perpetually outraged.  You ever see them fucking in the documentaries?  They are mean motherfuckers.  Mm-hmm.  Fucking batting their chest and pulling down vegetation and then biting things.  You know what that silverback looks like?  What?  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What? 
[01:27:00]  What's wrong with you?  Why are you laughing at that?  That's not nice.  Because it's hysterical.  I get so scared that you're going to miss a button.  What?  Holy shit.  Just trying to be your pal for me.  Well, it's working.  I'm going to have an invite to the compound.  Anything now.  Open invite.  Wow, that's a mean motherfucker right there.  Holy shit.  What animal are you the most scared of? 
[01:27:30]  Actually, let me think about that.  I would think it would be some type of jungle cat.  Like a big one.  Like a tiger.  A lion.  A leopard.  Something like that.  Yeah, because there's no.  First of all, there's no getting away from it.  And there's absolutely no reasoning with that fucking thing.  Well, I hear rhinos are nasty.  Yeah, but it looks like you could just move sideways and get away from them.  Yeah, it's almost like a bullfight kind of a thing with a rhino. 
[01:28:00]  I don't think they could pivot too well, so I'm not too scared of the rhino.  And I don't think a rhino will.  Oh, it's a little baby tiger.  I don't think a rhino will fucking chase you that far.  Like I think if you get a little out of range of a rhino's like bad eyesight, he'd just say fuck it and turn around.  And you could sidestep and that thing's going into a tree, man.  But like a cat, like those things, they will fuck with you for the sake of fucking with you.  Tiger or a lion? 
[01:28:30]  How about a liger?  A liger.  A giant liger.  What's more nasty, a tiger or a lion?  I think tigers are nastier than the lion.  The female lion, though, the lioness, is really something to not ever fuck with.  Where are you at with bears?  Bears are pretty fucking intense.  Bears are pretty fucked up too.  But again, like they say, if you're of a sound mind enough and have the courage enough to sit there and cover the back of your head and just play dead, 
[01:29:00]  the bear will go away.  There have been instances.  A tiger or a lion?  All right.  So you're dead.  You're so fucking dead.  But where's the mountain gorilla?  The mountain gorilla?  That's some scary shit.  How are you going to come across one?  But I'm just saying the scariest animal.  I don't think you come upon them to the point where they attack you.  What?  I'm not sure.  Like a mountain gorilla.  Fuck that.  You see them in the zoo?  They want that glass removed.  Oh, yeah.  They want you so fucking bad at all times. 
[01:29:30]  But let's say you're walking through the jungles of Africa, right?  I think you'd be more apt to get fucked up by a cat.  And I'm not talking about number-wise, because there's probably a lot less lions than there are fucking gorillas.  I'm not even sure.  I think you're honest on them.  I think what scares people about tigers and lions and mountain lions, they sneak up from behind.  Yeah, you don't even see them coming.  I don't think the mountain gorilla would do that.  No, you'd be like...  But if you come across one of these guys in your path, you're fucked. 
[01:30:00]  Then you're fucked, yeah.  But they're not...  They're not hunting you.  I don't think they're actively hunting you like a lion does.  A lioness will sit there and do that crouchy thing where the shoulder's kind of...  Right.  And they're in the weeds.  Right.  And you won't even know that fucking thing's there until it's on top of you, running at  you at fucking 40 miles an hour to just plow into you.  Oh, would that be horrible?  Puddle of Aid says, what about sharks?  I'm not scared of sharks.  I go in the water a lot because even if you're attacked by a shark, you have a really good 
[01:30:30]  chance of surviving because they don't want to eat you.  Yeah.  These other things want to eat you.  And how about...  Or fucking kill you.  A shark, the whole thing...  And I swear, my brother's a marine biologist.  He could give you all the facts.  They bite and realize, oh, fuck, and move on.  Yeah, they don't like you.  Every once in a while, the bite is in such a way you're fucked, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But a mountain lion will fucking attack you and kill you.  Yeah.  A bear will attack you and kill you.  They don't stop.  And it's certainly a mountain gorilla.  The same shit.  They'll rip your limbs apart. 
[01:31:00]  And how about this?  With a shark, you leave the water, attack over.  Right.  Once you're on the beach...  Right.  ...attack 100%...  Right.  ...is over.  Right.  How do you get away from a fucking mountain lion?  Yeah, I'm not really scared of sharks.  No.  I'm not.  I mean...  Fuck them.  Get a little weird when you're in the deep water, but...  Oh, man, when you look into that hazy part, and you think that thing could come at you  at about 40, 30, 40 miles an hour, and be on top of you before you have anything you 
[01:31:30]  can do.  Yeah, there's some fear there, but...  It's that misty, you can't see shit, and wonder like, hey, that must go down a few miles.  Don't ever go scuba diving, man.  Oh, scary.  When you look out at that darkness.  Yeah, the darkness.  Monsters down there.  I always picture a big, huge blue whale as just right out of sight.  And those things wouldn't fuck you, or they might fuck you, but wouldn't fuck with you,  but just to see something that huge in the water would scare the shit out of you.  Oh, yeah, I would fucking lose my mind.  That's creepy. 
[01:32:00]  That's Photoshop.  Come on.  Number one killer of humans is...  I have heard this recently.  Pigs?  Pigs.  No.  Pigs.  I've heard this, too.  Especially when they get on top, yes.  Joe in Arizona.  Joe?  Hey, boys.  Hey, man.  Number one killer of human beings sought on National Geographic.  Hippopotamus.  Imposserous.  Why the hippo?  I guess too many people are living close to hippos, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:32:30]  It's Africa, I would gather.  And what they do, a lot of people will go to the water to do their laundry, and maybe  some fishing.  And the hippos are very territorial.  And they will bite you with those big, horrible four teeth that they own.  Wow, those four teeth will do damage.  Those are some fucking teeth.  You've seen the videos of hippos swimming?  Yeah.  You think they're slow?  Yeah.  Joe will tell you.  He saw the whole fucking show.  The hippos move in the water, man.  Yeah, they're pretty fast.  And they chase boats. 
[01:33:00]  I saw one where they were chasing one of these fucking boats.  The best way to get rid of them?  Yeah.  Carry marbles with you.  Because they will try to gobble up the marbles as quickly as possible, and you run away.  Got to walk around with a pocket full of marbles.  Yes, marbles.  Because the hippos that I've had experience with in my youth, they love marbles.  That was stupid without me.  Why are they killing humans there, Joe?  Do you know the answer?  Actually, it's because of the proximity to the water, like you said, and also the fact 
[01:33:30]  that once they're on land, they're extremely fast.  Believe it or not, for short distances, they'll actually just chase people down.  And you don't want to be killed by a dinosaur ever.  That is a fucking dinosaur.  That looks like a dinosaur.  Look at that.  Oh, I thought we were watching hippo footage.  This is E-Roc's cruise.  Oh, wow.  E-Roc's just sitting there going, he knew it was coming.  He knew it was coming.  Looks like E-Roc lost a couple pounds. 
[01:34:00]  E-Roc, you lose a couple pounds.  Are you implying that the hippo is thinner than, as you remember, E-Roc being?  Oh, okay.  E-Roc, you lose weight.  Just being short.  No.  I just wanted him to say that.  His disgusted no.  I told E-Roc, and I'll say it on the air, I love the Twitter version of E-Roc, man.  It's tough.  He doesn't put up with shit.  He's Twitter tough guy, E-Roc.  I like it.  I call Twitter tough guy. 
[01:34:30]  I like it a lot.  Yeah.  All right, Joe, thank you, sir.  All right, punch out.  I'm watching a video of, I think that's the chocolate buffet up on the promenade deck.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, it's not.  It's more.  It's the river hippopotamus at the Toronto Zoo.  I didn't know.  How does it run that fast with those short, stubby legs?  They do look like giant armadillos.  How the fuck does that move?  I don't know.  Let me go to Mikey.  Pretty cool, huh?  Mike.  Yeah, say, guys, I'll tell you right now. 
[01:35:00]  You have never fucking experienced fear.  Like the fear and the just, oh, that consumes you when a mountain lion screams at you, dude,  and you don't know where the fuck that bitch is coming from.  Oh, they make that fucking sound.  What's the sound?  It's that sound like they used to making the cougar ads for Ford.  Remember the Ford cougar?  Yeah.  And there was the cougar, and it would make that sound?  Oh, it's that basic sound?  It's crazy.  Oh, fuck that. 
[01:35:30]  That sounds like my ex-wife in court.  It was funny.  We were up in the hills, and I tell you what, man, we were just fucking just straight from  around, you know, hunting, and all of a sudden, man, we heard the scream of this bitch.  We figured, you know what?  Let's just go back out the way we came.  And when we did, I swear to God, she must have circled around and she wasn't fucking in  front of us.  Wow, man, that thing was hunting you.  Jesus.  It was crazy.  Yeah, that was hunting you, motherfucker.  Yeah, that's what a fucking pillow like, man. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, fuck that.  We were the now being hunted.  We were the fucking prey, and she was the predator, man.  It was crazy.  Animal is scary.  God.  Someone's saying a male lion.  Sit your ass down, Patrice.  A male.  What's wrong with you?  He's tiptoeing in.  He's making faces like that.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,  The male lion will stalk you for three days, we're learning today.  Three days.  Three fucking days.  Why the male?  The male doesn't do the hunting, but the male is like, the male will fuck you up if it 
[01:36:30]  thinks you're trying to fuck its female lions.  Yeah.  So I think they have no perception that you're not another lion coming in there to take over  its pride.  You know what I mean?  That looks fucking good.  Sorry, Ann.  Wow, damn.  Does that bagel look fucking good?  A little tomato on there?  Salmon?  Salmon.  A little salmon.  Smoked salmon?  Smoked salmon.  Smoked salmon on a bagel is good.  It's a baby lion in a blankie. 
[01:37:00]  All right, let's...  There are some of the cutest cats on the internet.  I think the internet was made for porno and kittens.  And cute kittens.  Because every cat video has 10 billion fucking views.  35 million.  35 million, 500,000 views on this one.  It's called I am...  I are cute kitten.  I are cute kitten.  I are cute kitten.  And 35 and a half million people have decided they need to see... 
[01:37:30]  Oh my God, is that the cutest kitten I've ever seen?  Please don't hate me because I are beautiful.  Look, it's being put under a lampshade.  And then it pops out the top.  35 million for this?  Look, look, it's in a file cabinet.  Oh.  It's crazy.  And now it's in a little basket of fruit.  And it jumped out.  It's in the fridge.  Why am I trying...  That's crazy.  It's in the mailbox.  Why am I trying so hard with my videos? 
[01:38:00]  35 million.  Why am I trying so hard?  Just get a stupid cute kitten and film that shit.  That's all you need do.  What the fuck am I doing?  It's any kitten right there.  It just came out of a gutter.  And now it's on top of a tent or something.  Look, it's in the cabinet playing with the salt shaker.  It's by the pool.  This is crazy.  Panther not home.  I go swimming.  Uh-oh.  No.  It's on a little floaty.  It's in the middle of the pool.  He's in a little bag, a little backpack. 
[01:38:30]  He's so small.  It's popping out of a cup.  A coffee cup.  This is crazy, this kitten.  35 million fucking views.  I love this without any sarcasm.  Am I really?  I fucking...  Why?  Look at this cat.  It is adorable.  Patrice, I think, is a softie when it comes down to it.  Who would love this cat?  Look at this cat.  He's struggling.  Coming out of the comforters.  Oh!  Look at him.  It's adorable.  It's on a grill.  Ugh.  It's a bitch.  Can we go to break with the honey badger, please? 
[01:39:00]  Honey badger?  You've seen the honey badger, right, Patrice?  Oh, yeah.  The real wolverine?  Yeah, the real wolverine.  The actual wolverine creature?  No, but the commentary on the honey badger, have you ever seen this?  No.  Holy fuck.  This is the honey badger.  Watch it run in slow motion.  It's pretty badass.  Look.  It runs all over the place.  Whoa.  Watch out, says that bird.  It's got a snake.  Oh, it's chasing a jackal.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, the honey badgers are just crazy. 
[01:39:30]  The honey badger has been referred to by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most fearless animal in all of the animal kingdom.  It really doesn't give a shit.  If it's hungry, it's hungry.  Ew, what's that in its mouth?  Oh, it's got a cobra.  Oh, it runs backwards.  Now, watch this.  Look, the snake's up in the tree.  Honey badger don't care.  Honey badger don't give a shit.  It just takes what it wants.  Whenever it's hungry, it just, ew, and it eats snakes.  Oh, my God.  Watch it dig.  Look at that digging.  The honey badger is really pretty badass. 
[01:40:00]  They have no regard for any other animal whatsoever.  Look, and it's just grunting and, ew, eating snakes.  Ew, what's that, a mouse?  Oh, that's nasty.  Oh, they're so nasty.  Oh, look, it's chasing things and eating them.  Chasing things.  This guy's hilarious.  Those honey badgers have a fairly long body, but a distinctly fixed set, broad shoulders, and, you know, their skin is loose, allowing them to move about freely.  They twist around.  Now, look, here's a house full of bees.  A house?  You think the honey badger cares? 
[01:40:30]  It doesn't give a shit.  It goes right into the house to bees to get some larva.  How disgusting is that?  It eats larva.  Ew, that's so nasty.  But, look, the honey badger doesn't care.  It's getting stung like a thousand times.  It doesn't give a shit.  It's just, it's hungry.  It doesn't care about being stung by bees.  Nothing can stop the honey badger.  It's hungry.  He is a bad one.  He's a bad ass.  Look, look.  Ew, it's eating larva.  That's disgusting.  There it is, running in slow motion again.  See?  Now, what's interesting is that other animals, like these birds here, they just like to wait 
[01:41:00]  around until the honey badger's done eating, and then it swoops in to pick up the scraps.  It says, you do all the work for us, honey badger, and we'll just eat whatever you find.  How's that?  What do you say, stupid?  Look at this bird.  Thanks for the treat, stupid.  Hey, come back here, says the honey badger.  Birds don't care.  And you know what?  The jackals do it, too.  Look at these little dogs.  They're like, thanks, stupid.  Thanks for the mouse.  See you later.  Stupid.  The honey badger does all the work while these other animals just pick up the scraps. 
[01:41:30]  At nighttime, the honey badger goes hunting because it's hungry.  Look, here comes a fierce battle between a king cobra and a honey badger.  I wonder what'll happen.  Look at this.  There's the honey badger just eating a mouse.  And then look, get away from me, says the snake.  Get away from me.  Honey badger don't care.  Honey badger smacks the shit out of it.  The snake comes back and it lashes right at the honey badger.  Oh, little does the honey badger know, FYI, it's been stung. 
[01:42:00]  It's been bitten by the snake.  So while it's eating the snake, ew, that's disgusting.  Meanwhile, the poisonous venom is seeping through the honey badger's body and it passes out.  Look at that sleepy fuck.  Now, the honey badger is just going to pass out for a few minutes.  And then it's going to get right back up and start eating all over again  because it's a hungry little bastard.  Look at this.  Like nothing happened.  The honey badger gets right back up and continues eating the cobra.  How disgusting.  How did it do that?  Of course, what does the honey badger have to eat next week?  The honey badger's a fucking beast. 
[01:42:30]  They're crazy.  The honey badger.  They are badass.  Jesus Christ.  What's next?  You never saw that, Patrice?  No, that was fucking great.  That's one of my favorites, man.  It's so fucking funny.  I'm sure some of my thoughts that this guy could be like a show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  One trick is funny.  Probably Payton would do a pilot with like fucking eagles and vultures and they're like,  I can't have this fucking.  It's one of those one and done.  One and done.  The little effeminate voice motherfucker. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Because not every animal is not like this honey badger either.  Not like the honey badger.  Of course not.  That's an interesting motherfucker, man.  Honey badger is an interesting animal.  We're going to break, actually.  So you eat the rest of the salmon.  Big mama prods.  Nice shirt.  What the fuck?  I'm trying to dress better.  Yeah, look at you.  I got to move on from this fucking place.  I got to get some respect down.  I want some respect.  No more t-shirts for this fucker.  Really?  Nice shirt, man.  That's actually a very nice shirt.  Nice quality.  I see it.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  You went from fucking zero to 60, definitely. 
[01:43:30]  That's right.  I got to get respect for myself.  Yeah.  Finally.  I realized the sweatpants and the shitty t-shirts weren't working.  That's working for you, man.  I got panning out.  I got some meetings.  Oh, damn.  I mean, that's not a meeting shirt.  That's just a...  You look way better.  The cheese is like, slow down.  Oh, no, no.  No, I move on to my meeting shirts.  This is just the casual I'm doing radio shirt.  I like that.  Nice thread.  Nice.  You should take a picture of that and put it up.  You never know.  That'll get 30 million fucking...  There you go.  Me and my shirts.  Just nice shirts. 
[01:44:00]  My next video.  Me and my shirts.  If a kitten came out between the first and the second button.  Yeah.  Out of the pocket, right?  Punch me a kitten in a pocket.  And if we're talking about a dress, why are you wearing the Raiders fucking hat?  They beat my Jets.  Because they match my boots.  That's it, right?  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  We've talked about it.  Leave black people alone when it comes to that shit.  Oh, there's a kitten in a pocket.  Oh.  It's the cutest thing I've ever seen.  Oh, so it's been done already.  Look how little it is.  This one is not as cute as the other one, though.  No.  That's why...  This one has... 
[01:44:30]  It's very sleek and athletic looking.  Yeah.  The other one looked a little wobbly and a little...  A little fuzzy.  A little kitten-y.  A little fuzzier.  Yeah.  Look how cute.  Oh, this guy's going to be an asshole.  You can see the big...  That cat's going to be an asshole?  Yeah.  He's not as...  There you go.  That's a cute kitten.  Yeah.  How many views on this damn thing?  Look at how little it is.  And it's trying to fight...  200,000.  Those little kittens that try to kick your ass.  Oh, my God.  Look how small a kitten...  How can you just...  How can you do anything to that? 
[01:45:00]  I don't care either.  No, you can't.  How could you do that, man?  Look, he's sleeping.  He's so tired.  Little kitten is so tired.  He's falling asleep.  He's just standing up.  And then he realizes,  Hey, I'm falling asleep standing up.  I'm fucking...  I'm tired.  Lay down, kitten.  Shit.  I missed a window of fucking taping my animals.  It's past cute age.  The muscles are losing its tone a little bit.  Fuck.  They can't keep their fur together.  No one cares.  I'm going to fucking film my dogs. 
[01:45:30]  It's too late, though.  How many views?  It's too late.  How many views on this one, Sam?  This is 1.2 million.  1.2 million.  Not only is the little kitten falling asleep, front and center, but there's two kittens  behind him just brawling.  You know what?  I think...  I didn't realize there was something going on.  Everyone's competing for the cute kitten video.  Kittens are...  There's a cat one that an Asian girl puts up where her cat...  She has a cat.  Straight cat.  Yeah.  And she gets millions.  Millions.  Why, though?  The cat has a name.  It's crazy. 
[01:46:00]  It does...  It just does things.  It'll just sit in the garbage or something.  It's one of those...  Just a crazy cat, but it's an Asian girl.  I forgot the name of the thing, but it's zillions of views.  Amazing.  It's right.  It's people...  Oh, look at this.  Now the kitten's trying to sleep, but the other kitten's going to come over and fuck with  him.  Where can we get a kitten today?  He's doing a heroin knot.  Heroin knot.  He is just kind of...  Where can we get a kitten today?  Nowhere.  I'm going to get a cute kitten.  Yeah.  Put it in a lot of very dangerous situations. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm putting that shit on YouTube, and then I'm going to give the kitten to PETA to be raised  properly.  Like in the back of a garbage truck?  All that shit.  What's a dangerous situation?  Yeah, what would you do?  I would put him in the middle of Broadway.  Like with cabs and shit?  Yeah, but where the tires would go, he'd be in the middle.  Oh, that's crazy.  Because the kitten can't move you.  An unplugged blender.  Unplugged blender?  Just so there's no mistakes.  Let's do this.  Open door microwave.  Oh, that's horrible.  You'll be well hated for that shit. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well hated.  Have you ever seen this one?  Dude, turn the sound up.  Go to the beginning.  Let's go to the beginning.  Go to the beginning.  This is our favorite cat video on the internet.  This is the most pissed off cat.  And this is 64 million views.  Go all the way to the beginning.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Look at this.  This cat is...  Not a hint of ears. 
[01:47:30]  It's that pissed off.  64 million views.  That's a pissed off cat.  64 million views.  And that's where I draw the line.  God bless white women.  That cat would be gone.  That is a dead cat without any extreme prejudice.  Because that is...  That's a vicious cat.  That thing would...  That is put to sleep cat.  I wouldn't kill it, but I would just put it out in nature and then...  That cat could kill you.  It's a sleep...  Give it a chance. 
[01:48:00]  It's definitely a euthanized cat.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to kill that cat.  That's brutal.  You're never going to be able to pet that cat's belly and have it go...  Kevin from Connecticut reminds...  That thing is going to kill you.  Reminds me, that's our second favorite cat video.  Which one's the first?  And we should go to break with the first one.  Which one's that?  Because it is time to break.  Oh, yeah.  Whose cat is that?  You had to make it about you.  Aww.  You could talk about your cat in the 10 o'clock hour.  Is that Jess to the left?  Yes, yes.  Oh, why don't we move the camera over a little bit and we'll see some real cuteness. 
[01:48:30]  A little pant would be nice to the left there.  Sorry.  All due respect.  Anthony, we're going to break with our favorite cat video.  Yeah?  The audio of it.  Have you ever heard the guy yelling and screaming at his cat?  Oh, that's fucking funny.  I love that one.  Is that one mean?  You've got to see the video.  I truly believe he did it just for the video.  I think he probably really likes his cat.  To be fair.  I mean, we try to keep it honest.  Yeah, you've got to see the video with the fucking audio.  You've got to see the video with it.  So, we should play it off of it.  This guy just yelling and screaming at his cat for being useless. 
[01:49:00]  It's our favorite cat video.  Some guy yells at cat.  How many views?  Some guy yells at...  Three million.  Yeah.  Three fucking million.  This should have ten times that.  We'll go to break with this.  Who's going to play it?  I will.  From here?  All right.  Might as well.  Hit it.  Patrice O'Neill in the house.  Get the fuck down!  Fucking jump!

[02:12:00]  And he sucks  What?  I don't know  We're trying to look up  And see what happened  Anthony Coyne  I have no idea  Yeah I don't know  I honestly think  It was a mistake  Because I'm a really  I like guns  I like racism  Do people actually  Like racism  Can I say something  Though  Can I say something 
[02:12:30]  In fairness  To the people  Twitter gets confusing  Sometimes  Where there's a lot  Of ads there  And you go  Who the fuck  Sent this shit  That's true  Sometimes you're like  Did that person send it  Is it a retweet  To another person  So you just say  I'm gonna block  This entire mess  Because I don't know  What's going on  Because my girl said  You blocked this guy  For no reason  I go  Well he said this  He goes 
[02:13:00]  No he didn't say it  This guy said it  So she unblocked  This guy  And blocked the guy  Because it gets confusing  It gets confusing  It does  When you hook up  With other  The retweets  And the this and that  So I mean  Oh is that a blockable tweet  You know what  Someone wrote me  On Twitter  People are getting  Confused too  Because they can't DM you  You can only DM  The people that follow you  No you only can DM  The people  You have to follow each other  That's what I mean  Right  So maybe that's 
[02:13:30]  What's confusing people  They try to send a DM  And you know  It says  You can't send a DM  To someone that's not  Following you  But that doesn't mean  You're blocked  I blocked  I blocked somebody though  That was DMing  But you were following them  I guess  Like there was some  Oh when I was looking  For some kind of graphic  Help  I followed the guy  And he was DMing me  As far as that goes  And  But then it turned into  Like he overstepped  His fucking  Yeah boundary  Oh boy  He overstepped his boundaries 
[02:14:00]  And  Like I said  I get it on my phone  You don't remember his name now  So  I remember his name  Oh you don't want to say it  No  Why  No  What  They love when their names  Are mentioned  I just want to look it up  For us  He just kept like  Plug it  I think I  Yeah  I did block him  Let me see  Yeah  Hey look  Whatever  Sorry  You overstepped  Here's one  And believe me  And by the way  This motherfucker  That I blocked  Was texting 
[02:14:30]  DMing me  And it would come up  On my phone  At 5am  Well turn off your phone  I've been telling you that  For years  No I don't turn off my phone  Someone dies in the middle of the night  They'll still be dead in the morning  Who cares  You don't get the DMs in the morning  Right  No I still have it hooked up that way  But it's only people that I follow  How can you keep your phone on at night  How do you not  One ring  One ring and I'm awake for the night  How do you not  Nothing changes in the middle of the night  You can't save anyone's life  You're too far away from whatever the fuck has happened  You get a good night's sleep 
[02:15:00]  Because if someone  God forbid  Close to you is dead  You're going to need a lot of energy anyway  So you need a good night's sleep  You need your fucking phone  I'm telling you  Phone must be turned on  Don't worry  Contract negotiations  I turn that shit off  So does this guy  Call me in the middle of the night  Fuck that  No phone has to  This guy  Yeah what are you going to do with this guy  I'm leaving him blocked  Oh  Got no time  I err to the side of leaving blocked  I'm Texas motherfucker  Dan in Arkansas  Loves how Patrice talks about people  Who were blocked  In past tense  Like they're dead  Yeah

This is the women's decade  Oh thank god  I don't know  You know how it happens  She's  You know  Somebody  I forget which comic  Said to me  I was doing the bitch in the moment  She's hot  Well  You know  Not  You know  I will give it that  I know  But she  To them  Right  To the outside of us  And this is not a rumor  I think I watched  I was watching Conan  Because  What's his name  Was on there

[02:29:00]  That's fucking amazing man  She'll be on The View  Yeah  It's the entertainment correspondent  It's just  I mean  I mean  I had  Look  Here's the weird thing  Is that  You know  We have a very small world  Of comics  And  And I don't know her  And then all of a sudden  She's on  Last comic standing  You know  Next to Kindler  And  And Greg  And I'm sitting there going  Wait wait wait wait  Here's how  Convoluted 
[02:29:30]  The shit is  That's not her  What?  That's another one  That fucking bothers people  No  What?  You talking about  Natasha  Gennario  No  That was not Whitney Cummings  That is not Whitney Cummings  So where did Whitney Cummings come from at all?  Exactly  Exactly  It's a  Natasha  Leggero  Oh wow  Is in Cummings world  She's the one that wears the long white gloves when she does her comedy 
[02:30:00]  Oh she's  She's from the last comic stand  I can't believe she took that from me  Yeah you used to wear the long white gloves  I used to wear the long white gloves  And then I'd do rectal exams  Unbelievable  Are you serious?  Yeah  She's  God I am  It's like  I watch TV like a stroke victim  That's kind of  I see Lewis on TV a lot  But Lewis is what keeps  Lewis is a hero in the game 
[02:30:30]  Yeah  He did it like  His way  It was more like  Like again going to the  Death of Goodfellas  The Donnie Brasco thing  Is that Lewis  Lewis knows  Lewis was  You might have to go and visit the guy  I just watched the guy's story  Yeah yeah  Neil Delacroach  Lewis is Neil Delacroach  That got upped  As opposed to  What's the one that got upped 
[02:31:00]  That Paul  Paul Castellano  Castellano  Lewis Black is Neil Delacroach  As opposed to Paul Castellano  It's like no one  Ever  And I'll be honest  I'll just say  Oh we had  No one has ever  Begrudging  Lewis Black's success  Not one comic who goes  What the fuck  Neither Louie  And comics  Louis C.K. too  No one begrudges  Louis C.K.  That's true  Shit  No one  Like no comic says  Because he put in his time  He put his time  He put his time in 
[02:31:30]  Yeah yeah  You gotta put the time in  He put his funny in  Hey I remember  Jacob's ladder  Come on  Lewis was around back then  That was it  No it's true though  You really do  I mean you do have a respect  For the people  All of the people  You know you go on the road  And you run into all these people  And you see them  And the ones who  You know the ones that I appreciated  The ones that do the work  And then we all worked in clubs together  And you know  And then it was  And you kind of go  You know it's fun having somebody like  You know Patrice 
[02:32:00]  Before you were after you  Yeah  Because you know it's like  Kill kill kill  When you've got that kind of group in there  It's weird when people come out of nowhere  Like you just said  Where did them  Where did she come from  Yeah when they all know  Kind of like they're two shows  It's like what the fuck  Where did that come from  And here's what fucks me up  People will say  Oh it's from the roast  Really  Yeah  Well I fucking had all  I blocked everyone's number from my phone  Except for fame  So when my phone rang  It would only be fame  I believe fame would be calling 
[02:32:30]  You knew it would be fame  I was playing a game  I told my girl to call me  Because make sure this phone was working  Yeah yeah  You never let fame go to voicemail  You always pick up fame  First ring  Don't try to be cool  Don't try to be three ring cool  Hello  Hello  Hello  Hey  How are you man  Good to talk to you  That phone's dusty  If I lose my signal  Give me a number I can call you back at  Oh that sucks  Yeah  Where's Lewis been man  We were catching up outside 
[02:33:00]  Where the hell have you been  You're on TV a lot I see  Not really  Really  Sure you are  You pop up a lot  They like you for the political stuff  Well I mean  I'm really  I mean I kind of haven't been around  Because I was  I spent the summer in Fruityville  Which means I was working in theater again  Oh wow  That's my  Theater  Theater  I actually  This is  It's so  I thought coming on here  To talk about this  Is going to be so pathetic  I wrote  I used to  You know  You guys know  I used to write plays  Yeah  Which was 
[02:33:30]  You know  About as fruity as it gets  And  That's how I wanted to be a playwright  So I wrote this play 30 years ago  And I figured  And this play was  It was done  And then it was  Done again  And then it was picked up  And they optioned it for Broadway  Which  And I thought  Okay  They're going to do  This is it  You know  I can get  You know  I'll get  You know  If they do it on Broadway  Then at least I can make  A live  You know  It basically legitimizes  You can get away with shit  For 20 years  Somebody somewhere 
[02:34:00]  Will pay you something  For your next piece of shit  So  So I  It was  It was done for seven years  Nobody  It never got done  Never made it to Broadway  And after  And then  I just went  Okay  And I always felt  There was something wrong with it  There was something  That just didn't work  You got to basically  It was a  It was a farce  So you can't  The audience can't think  And I gave the audience  You know  It's got to be  Boom, boom, boom  In the audience  Because once they go  Well he couldn't do that  Because his mother-in-law  Is in Jersey 
[02:34:30]  You know  The audience gets you  You can feel him go  I don't want to hear this shit  You're giving him  Too much credit  Yeah  Yeah  Well no  But it doesn't take much  So we  So we  So we ended up  I spent eight  I did four workshop productions  Of this thing  I did  All over  All over the place  And  Worked with this friend of mine  And we  Basically fixed the whole play up  And they did it up  In Williamstown this summer  And it was a  Huge hit  Jesus  I mean it was like crazy 
[02:35:00]  Good for you  And it's  But it's the weirdest thing  Because it was written  Thirty years ago  Thirty years ago  And I wanted to be  You know  It's that moment where  You know  Unlike stand-up  Where you can  You know  You've got  There are no parameters  You know  Playwriting  As you want the play  To be done on Broadway  It's like  You have to suck  You've got to have  Your tongue up  The audience's ass  Okay  You know  Come on in  Everything's going to be okay  You know  Unless you're like  David Mamet  And then you can  You can go blow me  So this thing 
[02:35:30]  Is a romantic comedy  When you say that  You mean  Just to clear  You mean like  You've got to  You need the audience  Dumb it down  Not really dumb it down  Right  I mean that's a lack of  No but it's basically  You know  You've got to make it  You've got to make nice  You can't beat them up  I mean this is years ago too  This is thirty years ago  It was way  A lot nicer  Now it's like  If somebody in the  In the play  Isn't  Kind of nuts  Or has some sort of  You know  You know  Asperger's syndrome 
[02:36:00]  It's like  Well I'm not going to  Go see that  Or  But it's  So  But thirty years ago  It seemed like  The movies were  It seemed like  It was a lot more  Artist driven  Like you know  Even the movies  Like I wouldn't imagine  A deer hunter  Would get made right now  Oh no  But like  Thirty years ago  It seemed like  It seemed like  People would be more  It was a lot more  Adult like  Respect  There was a lot more  Stuff where you go  This is made for  An adult story  That doesn't necessarily  Need a car chase 
[02:36:30]  This was theater  And what was interesting  I mean this is the whole  Thing about timing  It was thirty years ago  I write this thing  And  And it's  It's a romantic comedy  I mean it's  If my name wasn't on this play  You would have no clue  I wrote this play  None  Oh none  And  And so  I  You know  They kind of rejected it  And  And now  It  It  It  It  It would probably be  You know  There are theaters  Around the country 
[02:37:00]  Not you know  These repertory theaters  That are around the country  These places you can play  They  Have shown  An interest  In it  Because it's a family play  But there's nobody  You know  And they've  Literally  Guys have said  Well why would I want  To do a family comedy  You know  We're gonna have  I'm doing  You know  Herculean  And twelve people die on stage  This week  And that's really  What we're into  I mean it's bizarre  But at this point though  In your career  It's not like  Does it 
[02:37:30]  Is it ever a part time  Where you go  They go  It's Lewis  We're gonna trust  We're gonna trust Lewis  Like they don't give you  The fact that you're Lewis Black  And they go  Maybe we don't understand  And we will give it a shot  Just cause  You're the expert  Do they ever  Fucking  Come off of this shit  It's just like  It's like all of it  It's theater  Radio  Television  The only place we get away with  You know  Saying what we want to say  Is comedy  You know  Theater  You've got some schmuck  Some fruit  Comes down  Oh you know  Really  This would be a lot funnier 
[02:38:00]  If you know  You know  It's that same  Bullshit  It's the  You know  And plus  It's like  Theater is like  An abusive  It's like being in an abusive family  That just kind of tortures you  And then  I mean the one thing is  You know  You do television  And you know  For a certain chunk of change  They fuck you hard  But theater  For like 20 cents  You know  It's like  You know  Bend over  Right  And bring me a coffee 
[02:38:30]  It's really brutal  Did you have to  Did you have to  Like compromise  Anything with this play  After 30 years  In order to  No  Then I  Okay  So you were able to  So they did give you some latitude  As far as what you want  Well because I was working with  The artistic director  Of this theater  And I've known each other for years  And it was like  Okay  Do it  You know  But I've known a lot of other  These pricks who run theaters  And they're like  You know  And they don't  So who runs the game  In the theater game  Who's the bosses  But there's a whole group of  You know  The Nederlanders  The Schuberts  Here in New York 
[02:39:00]  No but like  Who's like  Saying TV  If I knew  You know  What's his name  The big producer  That does the action movies  But he does TV too  Yeah  Bruckheimer  Bruckheimer  If Bruckheimer likes you  You're fucking in  Yeah  Spielberg likes you  Right  So who  Who  Who  What  And that guy's a producer  He's a production company guy  Or whatever  So who's  Who's the people to know  In theater  There are about  Six or seven of these folks  Who  Who basically produce 
[02:39:30]  On Broadway  And that's  And then it's all  Kind of like  It's all these individuals  It's like  It's like literally  If every stand up club  Just booked  You know  Totally on their own  That there was no way  To kind of go  You know  That you had to go to each one  That's what it's like  In theater  So these names  Are the names  There's no like  Executive producer guy  Or producer guy  No  There's nobody  There's nobody in charge  And there's nobody in charge  Sounds like a pain in my ass  Oh it's unbelievable  So where are we at 
[02:40:00]  With this thing then  So now they're going to do it  In Seattle  Next May  Which is great  And that's all I give a shit about  It's like  You know  Are you in it  No  Thank you  Fuck no  Fuck that  There's nothing  Did you write a part for yourself  30 years ago  No  You never did  But the weirdest part is  Is that the guy  Who  There was a whole bunch of  Folks I came out of school with  And we were all living together  And one was Mark Lynn Baker  The guy from Perfect Strangers  So Mark  I'm writing this play then  And he's 
[02:40:30]  There's  There's two young  Guys in the play  Which would have been  Mark could have done one of them  Or it might have been  But it was the right age  Well he wasn't right for either part  So he never did the play  Now 30 years later  He's playing the father  In this play  Jesus  Wow  Which makes it  I said like a mortality festival  Perfect Strangers  For people like  Under fucking  Yeah  People under  39  Is like  That was  Bronson  Prince  Yeah  The other dude 
[02:41:00]  The Balkan show  That was the other guy  Here's the other guy  A little cash  Having a play in Seattle  A little  A little  You know what they pay  You know what you get  For a play option  For Broadway  You know like  On an option  30 years ago  I got  Like $2,500  $2,500  For a year  A year option  Which means  I've got the rights to it  And now it's $7,500  Holy shit  30 years I've worked on this play  So it breaks down 
[02:41:30]  To like about  It breaks down  To about  $250 a year  And you're not even  Used to people  Saying numbers  And you just go  Boy I wish you  Didn't even say that  That's it  I know I'm done  So people can still dream  I know it is  No it's theater  You took people's dreams  I know  There's a motherfucker  That threw his  Big pen against the wall  Yeah  Or he fucking  His Apple computer  Once he found out  Really that's it  Yeah  His play's not even  Keeping up with the cost of living  No it's not even  Keeping up with anything 
[02:42:00]  Oh my god  Throwing away his blazer  With the fucking patches  On the elbows  Fuck this shit  I'm not writing this  An eye opener  Was Colin Quinn  He finally gets his thing  On Broadway  He's there for a long  Fucking time  And you're thinking  He's gotta have  A fucking mansion now  Yeah  Nothing  Nothing  Oh yeah no  It's Broadway  It's unbelievable  I don't get that  Oh because  You do it for the love  You do do it  Oh Jesus  Don't you do it for the love  Well you watch  Well don't you watch Glee  If you see the love  You just do it for the love  Of the art 
[02:42:30]  Yeah I love Lewis too  He fucking fights  With being a curmudgeon  Like cause he's like  Appreciative  But he's  You always go  Hey man I gotta appreciate  But he just wants to go  Oh eat dick  Yeah fuck that  Fuck you  Fuck the love of the art  It's right under the surface  Holy shit  I'm too old to dream  About doing something  For the love of the art  Right  Pay me bitch  One thing about this game though  You  It never  This is  When I talk to people  About why I'm so miserable  It's like  I don't wanna be  But it's like

[02:51:30]  At clubs  You need this  Shitty show  Look at Patrice  Like huh  Why do you think  He's up  This early  And my right eye  Is fucking  I'm blind in my right eye  Right now  And my eye  Ain't even woke up yet  And I'm sitting there  Like I gotta plug  These shows  For helium  Helium this weekend  For helium  And I mean  There's decent numbers  But it's like  What the fuck  Does it  What happened  You know  You don't even know  When fans  Are gonna fucking go  I don't know  You don't wanna  You don't wanna  Have to work so hard  To get the people  In the seats  That's the main thing 
[02:52:00]  You don't wanna  Have to work  Too hard  You go  Just come on out  But it's just  People have to be told  What to do  And a Patrice O'Neill  A Patrice O'Neill ticket  Is a no brainer  But for some reason  It's not at that point  Because there are people  That book gigs  And they don't have  To do anything  And it's sold out  Within minutes  It's not  You know  A lot of it  Has to do with  Like you know  The difference is  Is that like  Like Chelsea Handler  Says I'm going on tour  With Hootie and Schmottie  Boom done  It's you know  The tickets  And Hootie and Schmottie  I did a club 
[02:52:30]  Somewhere in Florida  Hootie and Schmottie  I remain nameless  The club  Yeah  But Hootie and Schmottie  He goes  He goes  The biggest game  In time  Because I told him  It was an ice storm  Last year  When I was going to Houston  And the guy that ran  Houston Improv  I go man  I don't want to fly  In an ice storm  Sir  Can you push this back  And my special  Comes out next week  Yeah  And hopefully  Maybe I can sell  More tickets  Than I might sell  This week  He goes  Eh  And I go 
[02:53:00]  Well what's that mean  He goes  Eh  The only thing  That's big now  On the road  Is Chelsea Handler  If you're a Chelsea  Handler comic  You sell out  That's  That's the game  And they  Hey  If you're on Chelsea  Handler Jack  It's a pop  So it doesn't matter  Who you are  You just got  Your dub name  And you hook up  With her  And then you  Instantly get  She's powerful  Fucking  Selfie  Sorry that you  Hooked up with us  But here's the thing  I promise  I made promises 
[02:53:30]  To myself  I made promises  To myself  I said I will  Never do anything  Again  To help my career  That I'm gonna have  Regrets for  No that I'm gonna have  Have to owe  No  Okay  That I'm  We'll try  That I'm going to  That I'm going to  Fuck up  Their thing  Where  I resent doing it  But I'm doing it  Cause it's  It helps my career  But my resentment  Shines through  So I think  I would resent  Doing Chelsea Handler  So much  I couldn't 
[02:54:00]  You wouldn't be able  To hold it in  I wouldn't be able  To sit there  With  With whoever  Her people are  And  And  And be  At one  With them  And  So I said  Why go in there  And embarrass myself  But that's the whole thing  Of the world  Breaking the fame barrier  You have to fucking  Eat that shit  But I enjoy doing this show  But he's eaten enough shit  I mean he's already eaten  But we've eaten pounds of it  That's what makes it  It's like  I come here  But it's like  But it's the synergy of 
[02:54:30]  You just get to see people you like  That's true  Yeah  Yeah  I know there's a way  We're in this business  You can be around people you like  I did it once with Tough Crowd  I was around people I truly liked  Right  That was great  And it was fun  I had so much fun doing that  It's gotta drive you nuts  That the comics on Chelsea Handler  You guys blow out of the fucking water  And they're selling so many more tickets  But they  And it's not  I don't know how you guys deal with that  And you don't hate them  It's just  It's the business  And I don't need to name names  You can watch yourself  And you can say for yourself  I hate the people too  Because they should know 
[02:55:00]  They should just know  It's like  You fucking don't know  That that  Isn't fucking good  When I see some certain comics  And especially comics  That are popular in the south  And the midwest  And just filling up arenas  With drivel  It's so frustrating  And you see  A smart  Funny  Fucking  Relevant comic  That like  Is legitimately making you laugh  And you're like  Why is this guy working so hard  Can I  Can I give you one more  Another thing  I didn't  I have started to notice too 
[02:55:30]  And this is all to  Keep me from  Committance  Either murder  Or suicide  Just taking murder  Or suicide  One more pill  Than I should take  Alright  Just popping a Viagra  And just die  Like exploding hard  While I'm fucking  It's  You need  You do need  An audience  Yeah  And when I say  You need a specific audience  Because there's no  Famous comics  Who are  Who have this  Arbitrary  Audience 
[02:56:00]  Like I would say  Lewis has  A smarter  Older  Politically  Fucking  Savvy  Audience  With a mixture  Of people who are there  Because he's famous  So it's like  That's  That's the people  You know  Larry the Cable guy  Got all rednecks  Kevin Hart got all niggas  And when I say niggas  It's like  Kevin Hart got all the people  Cat Williams  Left  When he bounced  Chris Rock  Got the other  Black people 
[02:56:30]  That like  The black people  Go I ain't fucking  With them niggas  I ain't going to  A Kevin Hart show  I'm gonna get robbed  I'm going to  A Chris Rock show  Cause that's  Some other motherfuckers  It is what it is  Yeah  Dane  Dane had  But he's getting older  But Dane had  All the college kids  He got  Now that's who  Daniel Tosh got  Yep  It's all  There's groups  There's no just  Arbitrary  Everyone goes  Oh I'm just a fan  Of this guy  Cause that's where 
[02:57:00]  You get me  Where it's just like  Oh I got a few  Black people  I got some niggas  I got some  Black people  I got some  Crackers  I got some  White people  I got some  Idiots  I got some  Intellects  Regan had a lot  Of diverse crowd  Regan did  I have a weird  The weirdest thing  About my crowd  Is 12 years old  To 80  Yeah yeah  I got family  I have families come  Which is odd  I'm the weirdest  Family comic  In the history  Of this country  It's cause of those commercials  No it started  Way before the  Chasing after that  Crab man  I mean  That crab was a 
[02:57:30]  Life changer  I put Aruba  I put Aruba  Back on the map  He certainly did  Yeah I said hey  It was like  I felt like  When they came up  With that next murder  I went oh good  I went oh  Here's an island  You can go to  Here's a good place  To kill somebody  I truly  Where's the crab  I truly love  Those commercials  Well played sir  Well played  We got to talk  To Lewis about  Politics before  We get out of here  A little bit  Come on  Look at the time  Where are you at  With everything  We haven't seen 
[02:58:00]  What are you looking  About the Republican  Candidates  What are you thinking  I'm thinking  This is like  I've never imagined  Reaching this point  Really  Where you know  Look  I'm  I you know  But really  Rick Perry  Really  Really  Really  You don't  You don't like  I think he looks  Presidential  Yeah he's white  He looks presidential  He looks presidential  He's got the salt  And pepper hair  You won't even  Spend money  If he had Obama's 
[02:58:30]  Face on it  If Dave Obama has money  With his face on it  I won't have any  Fucking money  That's it  Believe me  Nothing to spend  There won't be anything  To spend  And we might as well  Put his fucking face on it  For what it's worth  Oh boy  Print up some more  Well who the  Print up some more  Wait a sec  Wait wait wait wait  Yes and let's calm down  Because you know  Let's all remember  I called out Yemen first  You were  Back in the 90's 
[02:59:00]  Seriously  You were absolutely right  And it's come to be  You laughed about that one  And it's come to be  You had a big laugh  Over that one  But anyway  You know look  It's for a group of people  Not to tax rich people  At this point  To say that  If you don't tax rich people  And to call it class warfare  Go fuck yourselves  Okay  Go fuck yourself  Class warfare  What kind of planet  Do you live on  To think  The tax  It's not  First off  It's not war  The concept  Since 2001 
[02:59:30]  Is don't use words  You shouldn't be using  It's not warfare  You don't shoot somebody  It's not like you're going  You've got a gun  To their heads  It's called sacrifice  These pricks  Stand there  And they go  Well you know  It's great  These troops  Some wonderful work  That they're doing for us  For $25,000  They come back  They give them  Okay we're going to  Put a plate in your head  And go fuck yourself  But meanwhile  Douchebag  Is giving  You know  He's got his fucking yacht  And his hoo-ha  But they're job creators 
[03:00:00]  My dick  They're job creators  Their company is a job  That's the job  Companies create jobs  People  People  I'm  I'm doing well  I'm not a job creator  I've got a company  That hires people  Fucking  Get a grip on it  I looked at my taxes yesterday  I signed my personal income taxes  Fine  Whatever they want  Take it  Fucking  We gotta build  We gotta fucking  Christy's not gonna build  Another bridge in here  Cause you can't  Fuck you 
[03:00:30]  You build it now  What are we  What are we doing  Why should we be taxed on that  When  What do you mean  We  It's  It's the fucking  It's 3%  They're asking  That's 1%  More than 2%  Milk  How about  Do you have any  Conspiracy theory  Stuff in you  No  No  We are just  Fucking  Stupid  I knew it  Every conspiracy  Is just stupidity  It is  They're not that smart  But Lewis  I think 
[03:01:00]  I'm already  Paying  Too much  Compared to  The 50%  Of the people  That aren't paying anything  Wait a second  Because you  Fell into shit  You fell into shit  That's the American dream  Not the communist  Soviet dream  Who dare  They're not even  Existing anymore  They don't even  Go there  Exactly  So why should we  Go in that direction  Taxation is not communism  You fucking idiot  It's a service  What planet are we living on  It's service 
[03:01:30]  Taxation as a redistribution  Of wealth  Is no  Well it's been our  No  We've been doing that  For fucking ever  And I'm tired of it  Oh god  It's not hurting you  It is too  Well then get a new shirt  I see it  As I'm already doing  Above and beyond my part  Okay  Alright  And why should I  Keep doing more  Wait wait  Can I just say this  I don't  Again  I'm really tired  I'm sneaking  I'm just gonna sneak 
[03:02:00]  This in  That's a great rant  Yeah  These taxes aren't  Going to anything  Except for to pay  What the government  Owes the bank  Right  I mean  Oh I  I know that whole  Cluster fuck  But why is this argument  It's almost  It's almost like  A baseless argument  To go  You know all this money  And who's getting  It's all  It's all  They're all trying  To figure out  Is how to pay back  This money  That they owe  Through our blood  Yeah  So I'm saying  Where's the argument  What argument  Is there 
[03:02:30]  Everybody's getting  Robbed  Right  Somewhere or another  Yeah  So I don't understand  Where the passion is  About who's in office  And this and that  When I firmly believe  At this point  That the president  Is a tradition  Like  Like a queen  Like a turkey  Or a queen  Like a turkey  I want to have  A thanksgiving  I want to have  A thanksgiving  Because turkey sucks  We don't need it  Any other time of the year  Italian food  Of no turkey  Imagine that  But people want a turkey 
[03:03:00]  Yeah  Because the president's  Not a boss  He can't change anything  No  He can't live  Where he wants to live  He can't  He can't move  He can't do anything  That says he's leader  He's just somebody  That makes us feel better  While the system  Continues to  Fuck us real bad  So I don't understand  How you look past  The actual fact  Of what it is  Which is  Our fucking bank  Is not  It's a private bank  In other words  Why  That we borrow from 
[03:03:30]  I don't understand  In other words  Why are me and Lewis  Arguing with each other  When  That's what they've got us doing  When the enemy  The enemy  Or the real problem  It's a distraction  It's true  Yeah  Lewis  I apologize  Lewis  And I've always loved you  Lewis  Lewis  Lewis  Lewis  Can I ask you something  It's true  Well it's good  Because you're one of the people  Who like it  You yell at  Like there's not a lot of  You fucking idiot  I love it  By the way  You can't do that no more  You don't get even to that  With your real friends  I love that  Do you trust the government 
[03:04:00]  As far as how they spend our money  That's my problem  It's like  Alright  We end up giving more money  Toward the government  For taxes  Here's what I  And then my problem  Is I don't trust  That they're going to  Fucking spend it properly  Well here's  Here's my basic problem  With where we are now  Is you can't have a war  For ten years  That you don't pay for  Right  You just can't have  I don't care what it costs  You can't  Turn to the American people  And go  Hey  This is a freebie 
[03:04:30]  No country on the planet earth  Has ever gone to war without  And I'm not  I don't care who you tax  But all he had to say  Way way back when  Is it's time for us to sacrifice  I'd have been in  If we're going to go do this  We've got to do it  But we haven't done it  I mean  And there's where it begins  And then it just goes  Into other levels of madness  That would have been  And what we do in the end  Is try  What makes me psychotic  Is that we don't make anything  Like we make money 
[03:05:00]  The whole concept is to make  Why can't Walmart  Fucking make their 2%  And if Walmart doesn't make 3%  It's just tragedy  You know  They made their stinking 2%  They didn't reach the other level  And so you end up pushing  And pushing  And pushing the button  To try to make more  Why don't you just bring it down a little  I'll pay a buck more  For a goddamn coffee cup  Or whatever the fuck it is  So that it's made by an American  How tough is that  And then you're out of your tax structure 
[03:05:30]  Think outside the box  If it's a buck more  I would say that  So we need the help  With these big companies  If you made stuff in America  Yeah we do  If you made  If you went back to just  American made shit  A little bit more dough  But we would just be okay  But people are so fucking  Selfish about paying more  I'm so anti the idea of  Like the war  Every single war we've been in  20 years later we go 
[03:06:00]  Oh yeah we went to that war  It was based on a lie  That was fucked up  Now there's another 10 years  That's going to go by  Before we go  Oh yeah yeah yeah  I can understand yeah  And based on  But we'll be there  Yeah we'll still be there  We'll still be there  But that's what I'm saying  At this point  We're in a  We're in a baseless war  Like but it's admitted to be that  Like but they go  Oh we're still there  Doing what we're doing  And my thing is  I go Obama  When he first got in office  He closed Guantanamo Bay 
[03:06:30]  Somehow  Like that was  That's what he  I thought he signed  Or some shit  And I was like  Oh okay  They're still there  And they're still there  Yeah yeah yeah  And the Patriot  I'm playing there by the way  Oh nice  Are you really  I'm going to go to Gitmo  Because I like to say  Gitmo  Gitmo  I'm going to Gitmo  That's considered America  Yeah yeah  We can go there  Lewis where are you at with Obama  Did you vote for him  Or were you an Obama guy  I said in my act  That what he offered me  Was hope  And I'm too fucking old  For hope  I haven't got time for hope  I don't  I've been through my hope 
[03:07:00]  And you know what  I got fucking  You know  Ass raped over my hope  You know  I mean come on  I saw something  I said about him  And it's absolutely  Come to pass  That what I was going to get  From him  Which I thought  Was at least a step  In the right direction  And this was all  I was going to hope for  Was someone who spoke  In paragraphs  And that would be exciting  Right  And I got exactly  You know  And pretty much  That's what's come to be  He doesn't look like  A leader anymore  Does he  Well he's kind of just  He didn't  You know  He didn't put his foot down  When he should have put it down  And I think that  Going after health care 
[03:07:30]  As much as I agree with it  It was a mistake  And this country  Underestimated  Racism  Really  I don't think so  Underestimated  He got voted in  By a lot of fucking  White people  Yeah did he really  He got  It was very  They underestimated  The fact that  White people thought  They might have been  Ready for a black boss  And I'm going to tell you  Where he lost it  For me  Is when he invited  That fucking cop  From Cambridge  To have a fucking beer  Wow  That's early in his  Tenure  When he said  When he said  It's just like 
[03:08:00]  You don't  Fucking  George Bush  Would have told somebody  To suck his dick  And that's what he  Should have said  I'm not going to  Fucking tell  I'm going to  Change my shit  For this fucking  He lost it to me  With I  Barack Obama  That's what he  That's his purpose  To me  Was to make sure  That we're  Just arguing  About horse shit  That black people  Will not  Accept that he's  That they don't  He's not doing anything 
[03:08:30]  Because white people  Hate him  And that's  That's what he's  In place for  And I think  The intensity  Of why people  Don't like him  Is why  It's getting dangerous  Because I think  The plan was  To keep him in  For two terms  Oh yeah  Why all this  Other horse shit  That he got  Nothing to do with  Is going on  So just to keep  People focused on  Either hating each other  Or extra loving him  Or he was a guy  That was the ultimate  Fucking distraction  Yeah  And I think  It's not 
[03:09:00]  The internet  And twitter  And this and that  I think  The information  That people  Have in their  Hand makes it  Very difficult  And that's why  That WikiLeaks guy  Is getting a lot  Of trouble  Because I think  The information  That people  Are getting  Is more dangerous  Now because  They don't need  The news  To tell them  That sounds  Very  Again  I won't say  Conspiracy sounding  But it's based  On stupidity  People are too stupid 
[03:09:30]  To think that much  Into it  I like what Lewis said  I think if Obama  Would have taken  The two years  When he had the majority  And had his  Own fucking  Everything  He should have  Laid off on the  Healthcare thing  And gotten a few  Other smaller things  Done  So he had a base  To build on  Instead of spending  The two fucking years  Where he had  Carte Blanche  With Congress  Going after  The healthcare  Plan  He could have  Done a lot  Of smaller things  But do you think  That this  His plan though  Anthony  Yeah I do  I do 
[03:10:00]  That was  I don't think  Like you said  I agree with you  But I'm going to add this  I agree that people  Are stupid  Yeah  But I don't agree  I think we all  Can  Some of this  Very rule  I don't think  The people that  Are dealing with him  In these rooms  And dealing with  What they're doing  In these generals  And I don't think  They're stupid  I think they know  People are stupid  And they're doing things  I mean the government  Runs every industry  In this motherfucking  Country  That's almost fascism 
[03:10:30]  I mean they run  The cars  They run real estate  They run  Healthcare  That's what that  This whole thing is  So they  Control all free industry  And that's a big  Fucking deal  And the people  Might be dumb  But they're dumb  The government  Doesn't control anything  Government is  Government sets down  Some kind of hoo-ha  Meanwhile  You know you've got  Well if I give you  20 million dollars  And you owe it to me  Don't I own you?  No because they don't  Because you know 
[03:11:00]  What they're doing  In Detroit  They're sitting around  Going you know  Who gives a shit  And they're sending  The money  And the money's  Going back  I mean I think  The health  Care industry  I mean seriously  If the government  Was running  The health care industry  I think that  The health care industry  Gives the government  A lot of fucking money  And the government  Sits around  And goes  Okay I'll suck  That health care cock  You know  We're paying twice  What we paid  For health insurance  In 2001  It went up 9% 
[03:11:30]  The other day  It's like madness  I get those  I have three unions  I'm involved  You know I get  Three fucking unions  I'm involved with  Right  And they  Does any of the  Do they pay a bill?  No they don't pay a bill  They don't give a shit  No  And what  This is when  It kind of blew my mind  Because I was  I've been watching  The co-pays  Of my thing  And it used to be  When I first got the co-pays  I was like  Son of a bitch  You know really  For Lipitor  My heart  My heart be pure 
[03:12:00]  You know  It's like six bucks  Now it's like  I mean it's all gone up  It went from like  I was paying  Let's say 65  70 bucks a month  Two years ago  For  Which is  I think reasonable  For like  You know  The amount of shit  I'm imbibing  In order to keep  This fucking  This fucking  Structure of mine going  And then  Now it's up to 180  And I'm thinking  You know  And I'm thinking back  To when I was broke  Which was for a long time  And I'm going  180  Who the fuck  Can afford this  No  That's just me 
[03:12:30]  And I don't have the kids  Shit  How is that  Fair  They're making up numbers  Where the fuck  Do they think people  Get this money  Might as well have  No health insurance  The Lincoln and Holland tunnel  Roll the fucking dice  From  From 4 to 8  From 8 to 12  $4 times 5  If you're going to work  That's $20  Every day  That's $80 a month  That  Where the fuck  Yeah  Is an extra $80 a month  Because now  You go  You pay your thing  But now you still  Got to eat lunch 
[03:13:00]  And you still got to  And  They're broke  They're still fucking broke  Yeah  Do they complain  Ah well  We can eat money for this  It's like  You watch the traffic  Go through one fucking tunnel  In an hour  How do you fuck up  And try to figure out  How much money  Just came through  Yeah  And they still are like  Well we went over the budget  We're down a few million dollars  Not only that  But when they really started it  When they first came up  With that easy pass  Yeah  So they're getting money  In advance  You know  So  Hello  You haven't figured out  How to invest that 
[03:13:30]  You fucking morons  They're idiots  And this again  Is a big number  In advance  Government agencies  Things like that  But Lewis  Do you think that  That shit is  Hello  They don't know  What they do  It's  It's fucking  It's crime  Give me your money  Cause we owe people  We owe it  Or we're  Oh we're stealing it  It's already fucking  It's not something  They're going  Boy we made a bad investment  These motherfuckers are stealing  I think  There's nothing you can do about it  I think they are  Fucking using that money  And spending it on projects 
[03:14:00]  That are favors  For other people  In other districts  This is supposed to be  Look  I pay money for  Fucking to go through the tunnel  There's a pothole in the tunnel  Part of my money  Fills the fucking pothole  Thank you  That's how it should work  I would get that  It shouldn't go  To this guy in Brooklyn  Who's building  A fucking  Office Park  Because  He blew  The guy in  The TSA  So now he gets a favor  From the  No  I don't want to pay for it  The major one was  When you go over to 
[03:14:30]  Iraq and Afghanistan  You see  And Cheney  I said  Cheney was the  Lon  He might as well be  Really  And actually  Lon Cheney's heart  Is probably better  And he's dead  The  Cheney's  Cheney  Cheney's with  Halliburton  Right  That's his company  Right  And so  I'm going to go  We're going to put a private  It's going to be in private trust  And I'll be the vice president  I won't touch it  And there will be no 
[03:15:00]  You know  There will be no favoritism  So you go there  And it is all  Halliburton  I mean  It was crazy  It's the amount of people  That we  The amount of money pumping in  And they're paying  And you know  And this is weird also  It's where the American companies  And I think  You know  Shouldn't be allowed to pull their shit  In part  Is that  They had all of the SUVs  That  They had bases  And like in various cities  And  Those  Those were Hertz 
[03:15:30]  Rent-a-cars  Now  Either  A  Buy the fucking car  Or have a motor pool  Like they did  You know  Like they used to  The old days  Yeah  Or why  They're serving  The people serving food  Are hired by Halliburton  So they're  They're making a profit  Off of the fucking  Serving food  To the troops  You fucking  Get  You've got  A fucking  Massive unemployment  Get them schmucks  Show them how to  Fucking cook  A fucking egg  And get them over there  So  This is what I'm saying  That

[03:16:30]  It's going down  They're not  All 60 of them  They're not ready  When you Patrice  Are ready  That's when it'll happen  Because  Getting some  You know  The youth are out there  Protesting  You know what happened  The police are literally saying  Can you please move  Thank you  And they're saying  Yeah we're just like those Egyptian kids  No the Egyptian kids  Have their friend  Headless next to them  Bleeding  In the street  And they're making a difference  These idiots are just blocking traffic  When Patrice 
[03:17:00]  Is ready to go  Look  What is it going to take  And I'm not willing to start anything  When you are willing to go  When I say that  When I say that though  I'm basing it on  Uh uh  The fact is  I'm just saying some shit right now  I know  Just in terms of  Thinking about it  You don't want anybody hearing you  That might take things differently  But that's it  When you're brave enough  I didn't know anything  At 20  Like meaning this  When I  When I might have  Before my feet swelled up  If I walk  Jesus  Fucking a mile and a half 
[03:17:30]  Holy shit  You'd have been a  You'd have been a treat in summer  Before I knew what gout was  If you were joining us for the revolution  A quarter mile  I laugh at gout  When I was sweating  We will overcome  Fuck this  My feet hurt  Before it was  Before it was  Askthemedic.com  Oh shit  My eyes hurt  Can I get a ride for half the march please  Is this like  I'll get out halfway  And start my march  You didn't know  It takes a fucking real special young person  To fucking do it 
[03:18:00]  It takes John Connor  It takes John Connor  And this motherfucker man  You look all over the world  When you see real revolution happening  It's old motherfuckers too  And they're shooting fucking rockets  They can barely stand up  From the fucking kick it's given  They're old bearded motherfuckers  And kids  Throwing rocks at tanks  I want to tell you something about  About your people  Yeah  With the murder of Bin Laden  The Klan  Which one are we talking about?  The Klan  I consider  I don't consider  Anthony  The Klan  But I do consider him  Willing to learn 
[03:18:30]  An upper class  Cracker in the hills  Yeah  The target practice guys  You know what I mean?  I love shooting targets  I think  I think  When they killed  Bin Laden  Yeah  Basically what they were doing  Was killing  Al Qaeda  Yeah  But now  Napolitano  If that's her name  She is now  The big people they're after  Are your people  To take their guns and shit  Now when I was 20  Did I give a fuck about  The right to bear arms? 
[03:19:00]  No  I didn't understand it  I don't give a fuck  And then I think about  Crackers in the hills  Crackers in the hills  Who are trying to not pay taxes  Who are trying to be free  But they always paint  Those people as an image  Of racism  And hating me  Right  That I would never join  Their mindset  But as you get old  And you're reading  You go holy shit  Here's the importance  Of the right to bear arms  So they're going after  The people in this country  Who fucking bear arms  Not me  Cause everybody  And everybody like me 
[03:19:30]  Got a felony conviction  So I can't have  A fucking legal gun  Any motherfucking way  So  So they're going after  Says that pretty casually  Any motherfucking way  Louis is trying to  Catch his breath  But they are  And if you read  And they're going after you  They're going after those guys  That  These  These constitution guys  If you read  Some of the  Jefferson era  Politicians  And statesmen  If you read  Some of their quotes  It's an amazing display  Of  The second 
[03:20:00]  We start fucking up  Please  Kill us  That's pretty much  What Jefferson  What Jefferson  Was saying  Now Jefferson  And those  Founding fathers  That the politicians  All love  Putting up on the pedestals  And talking about  When you read  What they literally meant  You guys are so insane  When we start  Fucking up  Your freedoms  Yeah  Please  Yeah  Please get rid of us  Is what they said  And you know  What I want to do  You know what  I really want to see 
[03:20:30]  More than I want to see  What's going on now  Pillow  Is for people  Is to get those  Crackers out of the hill  Shooting  Shooting  Willy nilly  At whatever  Vague government  Crackers up in the hills  You know  Shooting  Shooting  Willy nilly  At any  Anyone who might  Be in charge  Revenue  You know  Watch that whole thing  You know  I'd like to see  Just a bit of  You know  Revolution here  And basically  It would be  I can't even imagine  I couldn't either 
[03:21:00]  People aren't  I think they've  Geared this nation up  Where it's  Almost impossible  To have that  Type of revolution  Here  We aren't  We aren't  We aren't  We aren't  We aren't  We aren't  We aren't  Those motherfuckers  Would do it  Yeah but  You know what it is  It's not that  There's so few  And far between  Most of America  It would be like  Trying to run a  Fucking cow  In a thoroughbred  Horse race  And if the American  Is the cow  I bet you Wyoming  Has a fucking  I bet you they have  More than you think  Those motherfuckers

[03:22:00]  One of the  You know  Here's an exit  And it goes  And the sign  Basically says  There's nothing here  Yeah  There's no  You drive for miles  Without a service  Maybe it's just you  Maybe they're all  Ducking down  When you pass by  And go  Hard  Till the Jew  Gets by  Hard  Quick  And then they  Pop back up  With their guns  Crack us in the hills  But they gotta warn you  A million times  To fill up on gas  Because it's the last  Gas station  For the next  Thousand miles  Or whatever  No there's nothing  Out there  Yeah  Boy is there  Nothing out there  I think we could move 
[03:22:30]  A lot of people  Out there  According to your  Two theories  We'll be moving  There next  You'll be standing  Out back  Shooting a paper  Target  And the next thing  You know  You wake up  In the middle of  Wyoming  What happened  I'm in a militia  I don't know  I see it as  We're not built  For that type of  Revolution  That you see  Happening around  The world  Not yet  It's gotta get worse  Yeah  We're so comfortable  What would be the worst though 
[03:23:00]  I don't know  It's gotta keep  Down this road  For a while  When it's not comfortable  When you go home  We bitch a lot  But it's still comfortable  Even the impoverished people  They could turn that faucet  And the water comes out  Flip a switch  The lights come on  Maybe their power  Got shut off  But their power  Got shut off  The power  Is in shut off  When shit really  Starts falling apart  And enough people  Don't have  You know  If I go to turn  My water on  And that doesn't come on  Two days later  I'm starting to shoot people  That's just how it's gonna be  Just two days  That's it  But that's how it's gonna be

[03:31:00]  Videoing  The police  Doing what I say  Is an amazingly  Restrained job  Of corralling them  I think the cops  Have been good  And I don't think  There's been  From what I gather  A lot of  30 years ago  They had a piece of wood  Up against their  Fucking heads  And they're complaining  Well here's the reason  30 years ago  Because back then  Cops had no clue  As to what to do  When people were  You know  When you had a bunch  Of 20 year olds  Like myself  Going berserk  Well no I wasn't  20 then  40  It was 40 years ago
