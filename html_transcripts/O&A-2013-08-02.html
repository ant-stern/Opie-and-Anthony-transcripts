<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts and in-studio guest Danny Falcone engaging in vulgar banter about sex and bodily functions.  The conversation quickly pivots to a news story about inept bank robbers whose careless mistake – leaving a photograph at the crime scene – led to their arrest.  The hosts discuss the absurdity of the situation and touch on the racial implications of the crime, speculating on how the public perception might differ depending on the robbers' race.

Opie then dominates the conversation with detailed accounts of his recent dental misfortunes, including a broken tooth, a painful dentist visit resulting in a nose injury from an x-ray machine, and the looming necessity of a root canal.  This segues into a lengthy discussion about dental pain, personal experiences with dentists, and the various unpleasant aspects of dental procedures like root canals, crowns, and bridges.

The show transitions to a discussion of a criminal's excessively long prison sentence (life plus a thousand years), prompting speculation on the absurdity of such punishment. This leads to a discussion of prison songs and the experiences of prisoners, mentioning artists like Johnny Cash.

The conversation then shifts to radio programming and music selection.  Danny Falcone, a SiriusXM DJ, contributes his expertise, discussing strategies for creating a good listening experience, including the use of nostalgia in music programming.  The discussion continues with further humorous exchanges about bathing suits, Taylor Swift, and the lack of essential equipment in their studio.

A segment dedicated to their radio experiences follows.  The hosts promote a "cash call jackpot" segment with Sam the Man Roberts and reminisce about past radio promotions, including a particularly offensive bit from their K-Rock days involving the phrase "Suck cock for K-Rock," a recording of which they tease but don't play.  Danny shares anecdotes from his own radio career, including winning a WBAB sweatshirt and losing radio memorabilia during his divorce.  E-Rock plays a sample of the "Suck cock for K-Rock" bit featuring various callers.

The show moves on to other memorable radio moments, including a listener named Antoinette repeatedly saying "hello" for an hour to win Rick Springfield tickets. They discuss the cost of licensing older radio material. A clip of Sam the Man Roberts' intro plays, which leads to a discussion of other radio personalities.  A significant portion focuses on clips from a reality show featuring Flavor Flav and Joe Francis, highlighting a heated argument involving the phrase "Strawberry bullshit."  Finally, they discuss another reality show featuring a contestant defecating on the stairs, deemed the "worst reality show moment."  D.L. Hughley's impending arrival is announced, along with a comparison of Anthony Weiner's political career to the dirtiness of New York City.


The next segment heavily features a heated and highly offensive debate about the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman case, with D.L. Hughley as a guest. The discussion uses the n-word repeatedly and delves into racial profiling, the justice system, and media influence.  Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal and Riley Cooper's racial slur are also briefly mentioned.  Later, comedian Nick DiPaolo joins, shifting the conversation to lighter topics such as T-shirts, upcoming gigs, and personal grooming, with humorous anecdotes about hotels and hygiene.

A segment with Nick DiPaolo follows, starting with humorous banter about hairstyles and progressing to crude discussions of female genitalia.  DiPaolo promotes his stand-up shows.  The majority of this segment centers on the departure of interns Sydney and Jackie. The hosts reminisce about past interns using offensive nicknames, discuss Sydney's move to a Florida radio job, and mention the continued employment of "Intern Douchebag."  A new male intern with connections to Opie's college is announced.  A lengthy, rambling anecdote about a past encounter with "Kahlua girls" and a missed skinny-dipping opportunity ensues, filled with off-color jokes. The segment concludes with a farewell to Sydney, including cake and balloons, and a brief call from a former co-worker, Joe, discussing their shared past in the HVAC industry.


The final segment focuses on the farewell for interns Sydney and Jackie, with Denny, Sam Roberts, and DJ Who Kid joining the hosts.  The send-off includes cake and balloons, but is filled with crude and sexually suggestive comments about the interns and a lengthy discussion on the hosts' preferences for different body types, particularly a preference for "chubby" women.  The segment concludes with the interns' departure.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  What before has one radio show been so extreme?  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy!  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane. I mean, I mean...  This is insane.  So flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  Why do we even try?  Let's just fart in from the mics and call it a day.  This is the funniest shit ever.  It's a weird show.  That's what's real.  That's sex.  Tune in with no expectations.  Quite simply.  The greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Here we are.  Gilkey and Anthony's show.  Another four hours of love.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo! 
[00:01:00]  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah!  Check!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Check it!  I'm up early in the morning.  Yawning.  But Opie Anthony, yeah.  Jimmy Traney poignant.  Opie like brother man.  Ant wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand.  He working all the hands.  Turn my headphones up.  There are horrible people, what to say in this old.  Objectional human beings, and I want you to know.  Unacceptable to my scene, but I'll give it a go.  50 Cent Larry King, Opie and Anthony's show. 
[00:01:30]  Go, go.  I know you're feeling the flow.  But Opie's motherfucking, too, he's trying to get blown.  And we come to play around, and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before.  How important is your board?  Board you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh, yeah, on the edge of your, yeah.  Cause you really want to hear Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony's show.  Check out, it's the Opie and Anthony's show. 
[00:02:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, 50, yeah.  Now my type's up in this pit.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  Booga, booga, booga, booga.  Enough of this platter.  Let's get this show on the road.  Hey, good morning, everybody. 
[00:02:30]  And ain't it a fine morning?  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  We, well, I'm a little up.  We are the dinosaurs marching, marching.  My son knows the real song.  How did they get so violent?  Well, that's how I say it when my son's singing the real song.  Oh, he likes the dinosaur song?  He sure does.  That's adorable. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, wow.  We didn't even talk about the bank robbers that put on a white skull.  Oh, they put on like Hollywood-type masks.  Like this full head mask of white people.  Yeah, complete masks.  Two white guys.  You gotta pull it down really hard.  Yeah.  And then, yeah, white guys with goatees.  Yeah.  How did they figure out who was under the mask?  They fucked up or something.  But how did they fuck up?  When they were robbing one of the banks, they took a picture of the teller or the bank manager's house. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  And they showed the picture and said, look, we know where you live.  Oh, that's great.  And then they left the picture there on the scene, and they were able to, from the picture,  find out what Walmart they took the fucking, they got the picture from, and got a name and address.  See, that's why I love that the government spies on us. 
[00:04:00]  That's when you don't mind it.  They really fucked up.  Wow, that's really how they got caught.  Yeah.  No kidding.  The masks were pretty damn good, too, huh?  Yeah.  It looks creepy, because they look like the, it looks like a face transplant guy.  Right.  You know how their faces are just kind of,  No, it's pretty close.  Yeah.  The eyes are a little, a little setback.  But they put sunglasses on.  Right, because they knew they would look a little strange with the eyes.  Yeah.  Man, but that's how they got caught.  Yeah.  That's some 48-hour shit. 
[00:04:30]  That is.  That's some CSI slash 48-hour shit.  They, I guess they were inspired by, what is it, town?  The town?  The town, okay.  The movie The Town, where they were nuns with those masks on.  I mean, I like The Town.  That was a pretty good movie.  It was a pretty good movie, right?  I didn't mind that one at all.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  You know, it's, quickly, because I know a lot of people have said this on Twitter and stuff. 
[00:05:00]  So, if that was white guys with a black mask on, it would be some kind of, oh, that's people just perpetuating stereotypes.  That's all.  Like, race would have definitely been brought into it.  Meanwhile, it is a perfect way to get a, to pull off a crime, because it completely fucks up the whole description of the perpetrator.  Sure.  And I don't, you know, race isn't involved at all.  But if it was the other way around, people would bring race into it and say, like, oh, that figure's because, you know, they're trying to make it like black people commit more crime. 
[00:05:30]  There'd be some kind of Reverend Al thing there, or Jesse Jackson.  I just don't see colors.  Yeah, I don't either.  I really don't see colors.  Sure.  I know I have it way better than most people, because of the color of my skin.  Oh, yeah.  I don't really see colors.  Yeah.  Privileged-like guy.  Yes.  Yes.  Very privileged.  Came from a very privileged background.  That's not the stories I heard. 
[00:06:00]  I'm just going to fuck it up every day.  Yeah.  Remember that stupid tooth that I broke off eating hummus?  Die!  Yeah.  I got a crown.  I got a crown.  My first crown.  My teeth are in pretty good shape, actually.  I've been all right over the years.  And I don't know.  That same tooth started hurting about a week ago.  It went from, ooh, did I floss a little too hard to, oh, my God, I can't drink water in three days. 
[00:06:30]  A little sensitive.  But it went from just a little something, like, oh, I might have rubbed my gums a little too hard, brushing my teeth, or flossing.  You know, one of those where all of a sudden you got a little something in your mouth, but no big deal.  To, yeah, I couldn't even drink water with, like, just fucking pain shooting across my whole head.  That dental pain will get you.  Oh, man.  Dental pain is a motherfucker.  It's crazy how sensitive that shit is.  It's fucked up, right?  Yeah.  It's just nerve endings. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  So I begged my dentist, and, you know, I hate when you have to do this shit.  You call up and go, I don't give a fuck what his schedule is.  I don't care that you're booked for two weeks.  I need to see him now.  Lickety split.  And it didn't hurt that he asked for Jim Norton tickets recently.  Oh.  So I called in a favor right the fuck back.  Nice.  He texted me when Jimmy was playing Carolines.  He goes, I would really like to see Jimmy.  Because, you know, when we're in the chair, we have a little chit-chat. 
[00:07:30]  And I one time said, look, if you ever need any tickets, you know, feel free to fucking write me.  And I usually don't mean that.  I hope the people I say that to don't.  Yeah.  But I didn't mind when he did.  So I got him Jim Norton tickets.  So I'm like, I'm going to use that.  So I called up, and he goes, look, I can see you for a half hour.  But I've got to get out of here by six.  I'm like, fuck.  Greg Hughes has dentists in his pockets like so many nickels and dimes.  Yeah.  Nice. 
[00:08:00]  So I went down there, and I pretty much broke my nose on the x-ray machine.  What?  Well, he goes, all right, we've got to take a quick x-ray.  And then, like, the lady who's the receptionist is all of a sudden setting up for the x-rays.  What the hell's going on at this place?  Cutting some corners.  I've seen her as the receptionist forever.  Yeah.  And she doesn't really smile or anything.  Next thing you know, I'm in the chair, and she's doing my x-rays.  I'm like, what?  Oh, did she go to push the fucking thing closer to your face and hit your nose?  Ah, well, you know those x-ray things? 
[00:08:30]  I don't know why they can't make those just a little more comfortable.  Oh, you've got to bite down, and it fucking, like, cutting into it.  It hits the top palate, right?  It's terrible.  Especially the tooth I'm talking about is way in the back, so it's the one where they have  to really, like, all right, open it as wide as you can.  Why?  Why do those things still fucking hurt in 2013?  Ow.  And they're, like, bite down, and then you feel it's just fucking jamming into your soft palate.  So I'm like, oh, my God. 
[00:09:00]  And, you know, she got the x-ray, and I had opened my mouth really wide.  She pulls it out, and I was in such, like, pain.  It was just so awkward that I went like this with my head really hard to the left.  Bam, right into the x-ray machine.  Oh, man.  She goes, oh, my God.  Are you okay?  I'm like, no, I'm not, actually.  I saw stars.  It's swollen on the left side here.  My stupid nose.  So then he comes in, and he goes, let me put the x-ray up on the screen.  And I don't understand doctors and dentists, and now I have to add dentists to this. 
[00:09:30]  They see these fucking blurry x-rays, and they know exactly what's going on.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I'm looking as a layman, obviously.  See right here?  And I'm like, no, I don't see right here.  What are you talking about?  It's just blurry teeth.  He goes, oh, your roots are swollen, and you need a root canal.  I don't see it.  I don't see it, sir.  I don't see that.  Because see this white line?  That's your sinuses.  And you see this little, it looks like, I swear, it looks like one of the first pictures 
[00:10:00]  we got to see of Mars, just all blurry, where this might be an old riverbed.  But to him, it's like, oh, that's a nerve, and that's dead.  I'm like, good.  I really want to hear that parts of my body are dying.  That's dead.  So you need a root canal.  And I don't do it, because that's a very tough root canal to do.  So I got to send you to a specialist.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  Oh, the other thing I forgot to tell you was the little dentist hammer. 
[00:10:30]  You want to talk about pain?  Tink, tink, tink, tink.  He goes, okay, open your mouth.  This was, I think, before the x-ray.  He goes, all right, let me poke around a little bit.  He got his tiny little hammer in there.  Tiny little, and you could just feel the metal of it.  Tink, tink, tink.  He goes, tink, tink, tink, tink.  Does that hurt?  No.  Tink, tink, tink.  Does that hurt?  No.  Tink, tink.  Ah!  You didn't have to ask me if it hurt.  That fucking thing sucks. 
[00:11:00]  I hate that fucking thing.  Tink, tink, tink, tink.  And you hear it go, tink, tink, tink, tink.  Yes.  And when he hit the spot, it gave me an instant headache that I've been dealing with to this  very moment.  Oh, my God.  Tink, tink, tink.  So.  Wow.  And then he gave me some moxicillin.  Moxicillin?  Moxicillin.  Some penicillin.  And he goes, the penicillin's going to make you feel better almost immediately.  And you're going to think, ah, I don't need this done.  Trust me, you need this done.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Don't put it off. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  But he gave me some relief because I'm drinking the coffee and I don't feel that fucking pain.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, but you've got to get it done.  Right.  Yeah, you're going through the tea thing, too, right?  Oh, right, right.  As we speak.  I just got the call yesterday.  It's like, are you confirming your appointment for bloody blah?  So, yeah, yeah.  I got shit that's got to get done.  Crowns and fucking shit.  And, uh...  Have you ever had a root canal?  Oh, yeah.  Quite a few.  Aren't we supposed to have root canals by now?  Quite a few.  Our age? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  So, I've been pretty lucky on that front, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And what causes the root canal?  I don't even know.  Is it bad brushing?  No, I don't know.  It could be cavity.  If you don't get cavities taken care of soon enough.  Right.  And it gets a little too deep.  Right.  And, um...  Yeah.  No, this thing is weird because it's like...  The nerve starts way up in.  That's why he says he can't do it.  Yeah.  On this particular tooth.  And the back teeth, the nerves are way up there.  And if the nerve dies, they gotta fucking do a root canal.  Yeah.  They take all that shit. 
[00:12:30]  Like, you got your roots in the tooth.  And they drill them out.  And they rip your fucking nerves out.  And then they fill the root canal up with cement and shit.  Whatever the fuck they use.  So, the tooth is, like, non-existent anymore.  There's no more nerve.  There's no more pulp.  Right.  And then they pop a crown on top.  That's gonna hurt, right?  Uh...  No.  He keeps telling me it's not gonna hurt.  They're pretty good these days.  I'm a wimp in the dentist's chair.  I suck.  It feels like they're taking...  You don't feel pain, but the impression you're getting, based on the pressure and what he's 
[00:13:00]  doing, is that for every root that he's taking out, it feels like he's taking a little  corkscrew.  Right.  Going in and going...  All right.  And just pulling the roots out.  Yeah, I'm not...  I'm not...  Yeah.  I'm not getting that done.  Oh, yeah.  No, you gotta.  No, fuck that.  You gots to.  Yeah.  I'm a fan of the homeless, and I see their teeth.  They're doing...  They're plight.  And I wonder how much pain could they be in.  I see these teeth.  I'm like, I'm complaining about this dumb little thing. 
[00:13:30]  They must just walk around in under pain.  I see guys that don't even have gums left, and they still got a few teeth hanging on.  I'm like, that's gotta be ridiculously painful.  Hey, he's eating.  Right.  How does he do that?  I don't know.  Drinking water, I guess.  He's medicating with fucking cheap wine.  Right.  Something.  Yeah.  And then I guess I got a bridge that I've had for fucking ever.  But they're like, oh, we can replace that.  I'm like, do it up.  What's a bridge? 
[00:14:00]  It's like when they had to yank a couple of teeth.  Right.  So they fasten a bridge between the two teeth that are good in between the one that they took out.  Right.  And then they put a fake one on the bridge.  Right.  So you don't have to floss that area.  No, you gotta kind of floss underneath it.  Oh, what a pain in the ass.  Oh, it's just the worst thing ever.  No.  Well, it's good if you don't have any of those.  I don't want a bridge.  But I could...  I'm gonna look into them just putting a couple of screws in there  and pop in some of those fake screw teeth. 
[00:14:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Instead of a bridge.  And then you gotta get some crowns done.  And then I might get those laminates over.  I'll be sitting here smiling with the big fucking rich boss-less teeth.  Please don't.  No.  I won't.  Just don't make them too white.  No.  No.  They don't do it like that anymore.  I hate these Hollywood people.  These Hollywood people come in with those over-the-top white teeth.  I know.  And I guess it's made for their movies and their TV shows. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, on camera it looks okay.  But when they're walking around, they look like idiots.  No.  Believe me, these days, in this day and age, you just...  Yeah, it's amazing.  You can't even tell.  All right.  You sit here and go, hi-o.  You'll just laugh at me every second.  I never thought we'd fucking reach old age together.  This was supposed to be a quick run, you asshole.  From looking at that fucking video of us by the elevator. 
[00:15:30]  Just two fresh-faced kids.  When we had the big powwow at the IHOP on 110, I thought maybe we could squeeze five years out of this.  Oh, we'd do a quick five.  Holy fuck.  Say our goodbyes.  We're up to 20, I think.  Now we're fucking falling apart looking at specialists.  We're up to 20 years next summer.  Come on.  It's insanity.  That is crazy.  Anyway.  Went to the dentist and had to...  Had to had...  Wait.  Went to the dentist and had to had... 
[00:16:00]  That's what it says.  Two things.  Extacted.  If it's...  It says extacted, too, by the way.  Who's on the phone?  Dentist hit it with a hammer.  Wait, let me...  All right.  Let me start over.  It's Sydney?  Yeah.  That's no problem there, Opie.  You're just not reading it right.  Well, we have a lot of calls coming in because it's a really...  It's a hot topic.  So I understand.  Yeah.  We've got to write this shit down quickly.  I get it.  It's a last take.  Went to the dentist and had to had a tooth.  Extacted.  Dentist hit it with a hammer and chisel until it fell out. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  I have an appointment to tomorrow.  I don't think there's going to be a good call.  Let's say hi to Richard.  Richard.  Hey.  What's up?  We don't have faith in your phone call, sir.  So prove us wrong.  Prove us wrong.  What?  See?  Okay.  Go ahead, man.  All I wanted to say to you guys is I had fucking three cavities in my mouth that I had taken 
[00:17:00]  care of like a year ago.  Yeah.  It felt like six minutes for each tooth felt like fucking 16 hours.  It's like a god awful thing to go to.  Now I have one left.  And Saturday, she called me yesterday.  I was thinking about it yesterday.  And I'm thinking to myself, shit, man.  That's my day off.  I got to go and have that horrible procedure done.  Root canals?  No. 
[00:17:30]  It's actually a chipped tooth in the back, just like you guys were saying.  Yeah.  But it's not root canal.  So they got the drill out there.  That one?  I hate the sound.  I hate the smell of the place.  And I know that fucking power you're talking about.  That burning tooth smell.  That's not the smell of the place.  That's the smell of your own fucking tooth.  Your teeth burning.  Fucking disgusting.  God, that is really crazy.  I don't know why you'd ever want to be a dentist.  If you...  I hear there's a very high suicide rate among dentists. 
[00:18:00]  Because they can't take it anymore.  The smells and the fucking rotting mouths.  It's just terrible.  You're supposed to be calm and cool and act like you're sitting there reading a magazine.  I got all this anxiety.  And I'm thinking to myself, please, where is this guy?  Come in here and do this thing.  Get it over with.  Yeah.  Man, I don't know.  When you look at the history of dentistry and look back at the Old West, the 1800s, and  what?  Imagine having him sit in that fucking chair where the drill is like a foot fucking thing 
[00:18:30]  that he had to pump in.  You have a cavity.  They got to take out three teeth because the drills are so big.  And their anesthesia couldn't have been all that good.  By the bullets.  It's just terrible.  Yeah.  They keep putting the needles in there.  They put three needles in the last time.  And I had three down, like I said, that day.  And I was like, holy shit.  He goes, I don't know how to do the fourth one.  I'm thinking to myself, I don't want the fucking fourth one.  That's the part of dentistry, too, that's like, right off the bat, they're doing something 
[00:19:00]  that sounds like a torture.  We're going to take a needle and jab it into your gums of your teeth.  If you were doing that into someone's strapped into a chair and you're trying to get a secret  out of them, you could poke a needle into their gums until they talk.  Of course.  And they would tell you.  That's the part that gets most people.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, it keeps going.  How you doing?  How you doing?  I'm doing great for a guy that's getting needles poked into my gums. 
[00:19:30]  And then they pull out the drills and, oh, fuck.  Wow, man.  Well, good luck.  Good luck with your shit there.  Looking at her.  Thank you, sir.  What interview did that pig do yesterday?  I guess inside of this show.  Thank you, sir.  The wiener pig.  Can you get some audio of the wiener pig?  Wiener and the pig, we were just saying.  Wiener and the pig.  Yeah, someone said it sounded like a new morning show.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, it's wiener and the pig!  Let's add that to, what was it, Rape Kid and Crawl Space? 
[00:20:00]  Rape Kid and Crawl Space.  Yeah, I think wiener and the pig would be a great morning show.  Yeah.  Meh.  The wiener and the pig.  My aunt's dental situation is so fucked up.  She has to get them all pulled.  How fucked up is it?  She has to get all her teeth pulled and get dentures.  Man, you really fucked up when they have to get to that point.  But if you get dentures, then you're good.  Oh, man.  Are you good?  You don't have to worry about any more drills.  You gotta deal with that.  Just a little glue.  Oh, my God. 
[00:20:30]  A little effortant.  Is this?  Oh, that's her phone.  Inside Edition?  Yeah.  Who does Inside Edition these days?  Deborah Norville?  I think it's Deborah Norville.  Who was supposed to be, you know, she was supposed to be the big newswoman.  Yeah.  And she failed miserably.  And now she had to go into the tabloid shit.  She was hot, like, when she first hit the scene.  She's still all right.  I actually see her on Inside Edition every once in a while.  She's not bad.  Do you know who Wiener Pig... 
[00:21:00]  Wiener Pig.  Wiener Pig looks like the girl, if there was a hot chick, her fatter, not quite hot sister.  Right.  That would be Wiener Pig.  Like, she looks like she should have a very hot sister.  Yeah, something's wrong with her.  I'm trying to figure it out.  Her eyes aren't bad.  You know, we talk about the retarded brother or retarded sister of stars.  Sure.  Like, we always bring up maybe the Patrick Swayze brother.  Right.  He kind of looked like Patrick Swayze, only a little off me. 
[00:21:30]  She's the one that would be the off one.  I gotcha.  Or she would be hot after she lost the baby weight.  What is she like?  Yeah.  She's pregnant, I guess, right?  Is she?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she's not married.  She's not pregnant.  I don't feel like that.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I thought you were going there.  No, I was just being a goofball.  I have no idea.  She looks like she's pregnant.  She does.  I was kidding, yes.  She's sloppy, too.  She's not even just like a little weighty.  She's sloppy for that age. 
[00:22:00]  She should be...  She's horrible.  ...even tighter.  Yeah, yeah.  But her proportions are terrible.  Right.  Yeah.  This guy has a Maryland Brit...  What is this?  Don in Texas.  Is that Don in the...  All right.  Here's the thing.  You don't want to get a doctor like this.  And I'll go back and tell you.  When I was in the Navy, I had what's called a Maryland Bridge.  Right.  And what it is, I didn't have a... 
[00:22:30]  I had baby teeth.  When it came out, it's like no adult tooth came through.  So the tooth just sat there, rotted out, and everything else fell apart.  They pulled it out, so I had a big gap.  When you're in the Navy, they don't go for that shit.  So they put in a Maryland Bridge, which is really rare, and...  What is it?  It's...  And are you calling for the dentist chair?  It sounds like you got a little Novocate.  And some cotton in your mouth right now.  Get on my damn mouth about that.  All right.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  I have a car accident and got hit in the throat.  But anyway, so what they do is they grind two good teeth down next to it.  Yeah.  And then they...  They what?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Then they put the big tooth in between.  Yeah.  They wrap the tooth, you know.  See, it's a really weird-looking bridge.  But from the outside, if somebody's just looking at your teeth, it looks perfect.  Uh-huh.  I mean, it looks like your teeth and everything.  It takes about a month and a half to go through it and everything. 
[00:23:30]  But anyway, so I go to the dentist, you know, about two years ago.  And the guy's going in there, and he starts tapping on the tooth.  He goes, hey, what's this?  And he goes, can you feel this?  Because you do not want a fucking doctor or a dentist that fucks around like that.  If he doesn't know what the hell a Maryland bridge is, don't fuck with him.  Oh, see, he saw it and was like, oh, that's like some kind of wizardry.  Yeah, yeah, there you go.  All right.  Oh, we're looking at pictures of it. 
[00:24:00]  They're loosened.  To the back.  Oh, to the back of two other teeth.  Oh, it's for a front tooth kind of a thing.  Holy mother of Christ.  Oh, damn it!  So they must rough up the back of the teeth.  Right.  And then they adhere these metal wings to the back of the teeth with the good one in between,  the fake one in between.  Doesn't shit get in the...  It's like a bridge for the front.  Doesn't shit get in the base of that thing?  How do you clean that shit up?  I don't know. 
[00:24:30]  That is kind of fucked up.  All right.  Oh, he left.  Thank God.  Yeah.  Enough of this Maryland bridge.  I mean, have a good day.  Let me say hi to Ed in Staten Island.  He's a dentist.  Wants to defend dentistry.  Of course.  That last guy was talking out his ass.  What's up, Ed?  Uh, relax and quit your fucking bellyaching.  It's just a dentist.  Wow.  This guy's got some nerve.  I think we're all pussies when it comes to sitting in that fucking chair.  Yeah.  Listen, I don't usually get up this early, but I'm going golfing because I'm special. 
[00:25:00]  Because you're a dentist.  Yeah, because you're making a shitload of money off us because we're lazy with the flossing.  Oh, yeah.  It comes down to the flossing, not the brushing.  Dr. Beeper has been club champ three years running, and I'm no slouch myself.  So, Professor Anthony, just so you know, the smell of a dentist's office is eugenol.  It is not burning tooth.  Eugenol?  What's eugenol?  Eugenol.  Eugenol is a liquid that they mix with some of their cements that makes the cement set up. 
[00:25:30]  Like there's a powder and liquid in the...  Oh, like a fucking, like an epoxy fucking fixer.  Yeah, all that other good tasting stuff that they put in your mouth.  Are you just, I don't know, do you, are you sick of seeing people's rotting fucking teeth?  Oh, God.  It's not the look that gets you, Opie.  It's the smell of pus.  Oh, my God.  That's the thing that gets you. 
[00:26:00]  It's not the blood.  It's not the rot.  It's the smell.  Wow.  The smell of pus.  Yes.  That was a great movie.  That would get you every time.  And you smell it every day?  No, no, no.  You don't.  You know, there's certain stuff you do.  We do wear masks, so it's not that bad.  I remember the old days.  My dentist, like years ago, when I was a kid, just nothing.  No mask or anything.  Now it's like they've got fucking welding shields on their face.  Yeah, yeah.  They're like, I don't want this shit going in my fucking eyes.  You put a little Vicks under your nose? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Some days.  I remember the Vicks.  You know, it used to be they just used to switch the cigarette from one hand to the other  before they put their hands in their mouth.  But now, you know, all this OSHA stuff, you know, God forbid.  Yeah, it was like fucking crazy back in the day.  Sure.  All right, sir.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Drill away.  Have fun on the golf course.  I'm jealous.  Golf course.  Don't you have homes?  It's not enough for the dentist, I guess.  Man.  What else is going on?  That Castro guy. 
[00:27:00]  Is that case over?  Isn't that weird?  He pled guilty to keep from getting the death penalty option.  Oh, the death penalty.  A little deal they made?  Yeah.  So he pled guilty to not get the death penalty, but he got life plus a thousand years.  So after he dies, they're going to keep the fucking body in the cell?  For a thousand years.  For another thousand years?  They're going to keep him in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what that means.  Doesn't it?  I would think so.  That would be fucking ghoulish for everybody else at the prison. 
[00:27:30]  Isn't it ridiculous they got to do that?  They can't just say, look, write down on the paper, he got life in prison and we mean it.  Right.  Like, there's no way he can get out.  Yeah, just say life in prison and we mean it.  Oh, boy, do we mean it.  Right.  But they got to be goofy and go, life, ah, and then a thousand years.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like saying, no backs, no backs, no backs, no backs, infinity.  Right.  Infinity.  That's the kid's version of infinity of sentencing. 
[00:28:00]  Of course.  Sentencing.  Just say, and we mean it.  You're right.  Yeah.  Man, what a fucking ghoul.  He really was.  They showed some pictures of inside the place and there were chains bolted to the walls.  Yeah, he was all in.  Oh, was he a prick?  He was all in.  He spent a lot of time at Home Depot, I bet.  Oh, man.  Getting his goods.  But why wouldn't they go for the death penalty?  What the fuck is that about?  Uh, I guess they wanted to save the taxpayers a little money. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  They, uh, but yeah, death penalty cases are fucking crazy.  But, I mean, there's a big difference between death and having a pretty good chance of watching Breaking Bad.  Yeah, he could probably watch a little television.  Yeah, eventually he'll be watching some TV.  Yeah.  He'll probably get into a show, whether it's horrible TV, like Wheel of Fortune or something.  But it'll be an escape for him.  It will be an escape.  And you know what?  When you close your eyes at night and get to dream. 
[00:29:00]  That's pretty fucking cool, too.  He's not in prison when he's dreaming.  No!  You get to do all sorts of shit when you're dreaming.  I like dreaming.  Yeah, you know, I don't know.  Should we ask Denny for some of the great jail songs of all time?  Well, of course, I would think so.  Tonight is gonna be a jail break.  That's the one we all know.  Yeah.  He would go Jailhouse Rock, I'm sure.  Jailhouse Rock.  Right.  Folsom Prison Blues.  Ah, that's a good one. 
[00:29:30]  Very good.  Yep.  Ah, they should have went for the death penalty thing.  I'll hear the train a-coming.  Yeah.  Coming round the bend.  I haven't seen sunshine since I don't know when.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jailhouse.  Let's see.  Yeah, say you're in prison.  You get to see Johnny Cash.  Right.  These motherfuckers got to see Johnny Cash.  I never saw Johnny Cash.  I had to murder someone to see Johnny Cash.  And there were murders.  How fair is that?  There were murders. 
[00:30:00]  This wasn't people on parking tickets.  And it's his most famous concert ever.  Exactly.  So call me silly, but the fact is there might be a fucking man going to that prison eventually.  Johnny Cash?  I never got to see Johnny Cash.  Boy, they kind of stopped that whole stars going to prison to perform for the guys.  Look at him.  Man, was he a badass.  He was badass.  He was a badass.  Love the Johnny Cash.  Love him.  But he's there in Folsom Prison.  The fucking convicts are like, this is great. 
[00:30:30]  Fuck yeah.  I'm seeing Johnny Cash.  Fuck yeah.  Cash.  That train keeps rolling.  They must have really liked this.  They're like, yeah, it does roll out of San Antonio.  It sure does.  It's singing about us.  He's right.  When I was just a baby, my mama told me, son, always be a good boy, don't ever play your guns.  But I shot a man in Reno.  I did.  I did too.  I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.  None of them were like, that guy's bullshitting.  He didn't do any of this stuff. 
[00:31:00]  He's never been to jail.  This motherfucker can leave.  Yeah.  He's going to leave after he's done singing.  A great video would be him playing this song and do a little, I forgot the name of the show from back in the day,  but where the bubbles pop up.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then pop up video.  Pop up videos.  But have the pop ups of what every single one of the audience members did to get into that prison.  Oh, that would be a good one.  It would be horrific.  Yeah, yeah.  As they're listening to a nice Johnny Cash toe tapper.  And then just have like, yeah, like all the bad things that then just rape and it goes. 
[00:31:30]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Yeah, it's just all over the place.  Rape-ity-rape.  Rape-ity-rape-rape.  But it'd be like, it'd be like cute.  Like one bubble would pop up and say, this man didn't shoot a man in Reno.  Right.  Boop.  But he did rape one.  Boop.  And it's just like, wow.  Arm's robber.  Boop.  It's horrible.  And they're sitting there.  And they're just sitting there smiling, singing along with Johnny.  Clapping their hands, probably.  Yep.  Yeah.  Oh, Danny wants in. 
[00:32:00]  He's outside the studio.  Hey, come on in, Danny.  I didn't really mean it.  Oh.  Dennis Falcone.  Permission to come on board, sir?  Oh, permission granted.  Welcome aboard.  Good morning.  Happy Friday.  Happy Friday.  Happy Friday, Danny.  We've got a happy Friday.  It is now.  That Castro dude got life plus a thousand years.  So we're thinking of some of the great prison slash jail songs of all time. 
[00:32:30]  There's a riot going on in cell block number nine.  Coasters.  Back in the early days when they were the Robins.  Wow.  Really?  I think tonight there's going to be trouble.  Jailbreak, right?  Jailbreak.  Yeah, yeah.  We went there.  That's got to be the number one.  Prison blues.  We went there.  Prison sex.  George Strait.  I found Jesus on the prison floor or something.  Cell block floor.  George Strait had it a couple years ago.  Oh.  On the country side.  On the country side.  Yeah.  I'm sure country has a lot more prison and jail songs than us.  It's too bad we don't have country channels here at SiriusXM. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, we have quite a number.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I have to bring in to you guys?  I have to bring in the channel sheet.  So you have it there right in front of you.  You put it in a nice plastic sleeve, and then you can refer to it.  I meant to do that, but they grabbed me before I even had the coffee this morning.  They said, I need to talk to you.  You have to have that at your fingertips.  Right.  Actually, you can even go to SiriusXM.com.  And have it up on the computer.  Yeah.  I'm surprised it's not posted.  So that if we are talking about a certain genre of music, we could refer our listeners  to the channel.  And we'll have that sheet. 
[00:33:30]  It is plastic, so it doesn't get, you know.  Right.  It could be wiped off with a little coffee.  Right, right.  Might spill on it.  It's a great idea.  You've got Prime Country, The Highway.  I mean, you know.  Right, right.  There's so many great things.  Nice.  Murder is the case they gave me.  Well, he got off, though.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  But still.  Yo Gotti, 25 to Life.  Yeah, there's a couple of rap songs.  I've got a couple of rap songs.  What do you mean they're all rap songs?  They're all fucking...  Ludacris featuring Beanie Seagull, Pimp C and C Murder. 
[00:34:00]  Do Your Time.  Do Yo Time.  I don't know that one.  Do Yo Time, yo.  Why don't you acknowledge the rap world, Danny?  I do acknowledge it.  It's just not...  Are you a racist?  No, of course not.  Oh, man.  You seem to know a lot of genres of music, but you don't really acknowledge rap.  I don't see any power.  No, we were talking rap yesterday, Sam and I.  What about Trouble and his hit song, Patna's Got Stretches?  Patna's.  Patna's.  How are you going to get a job if you spell partners, P-A-T-N-A-Z?  Patna's.  Well, you see, you really can't say that because the birds spell their name, you know, B-R-Y-D. 
[00:34:30]  Birds.  Right.  So you can't say that.  The Beards.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why do they spell it that way?  Why do they...  Because they wanted to take a play off the Beatles.  Oh.  Because the Beatles spelled it B-E-A-T-L-E-S-S.  Beatles.  Beatles.  As opposed to Brooks.  So they try...  I think the Turtles also wanted to spell theirs with a Y.  Yeah.  The Turtles.  The Turtles.  So they wanted to try something.  So I really don't like when people make fun of the way rappers use their English because 
[00:35:00]  it happened back in the 60s, too.  Back in the day.  Right.  Patna's.  Let's see.  And that's it for the job.  Well, there's got to be a whole category of jail songs.  That's why you're in here.  Well, I know.  But again, they grind.  I didn't even get a chance to put the coffee on this morning.  I just walked in.  They said they need to talk to you about jail songs.  This is you before coffee.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  I just...  Why do you hear this early?  It's a little percolating.  You don't even have a gig, really.  Actually, I'm a little late this morning.  I like to get in a little bit earlier.  A little early.  Get a jump on the weekend festivities.  Settle in a little. 
[00:35:30]  Yesterday, he was getting a jump on Christmas.  Yes, Christmas.  How's the Christmas thing going?  It's going good.  It's going good.  I like to get a jump on everything.  I'm going to get that, Matt, the jump to conclusions, Matt.  Do you really have to be here this early?  Sure.  No, you know what I like to get in early?  I get a nice spot at the parking...  At the train station.  There's not as many trains ahead of you, so they just...  He can't even...  He can't say yes, because he doesn't want to even go towards that level of insubordination. 
[00:36:00]  Right, right, right.  Like, he can't say I have to do everything's...  No, I want to.  Yes, this is right.  He is a company guy.  There's things that I have to do that things that have to get done.  When do you go home?  When the job is done.  Oh, he is a company guy.  I love him.  That's right, Danny is the shit.  He is.  We go home at 10, whether the job's done or not, Danny.  I noticed that.  Let me tell you.  Legal ID hits.  It's not...  You guys are up with Danny.  Yep.  Boom.  Danny's the guy, though, that you want working for you.  Of course. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  You want a building full of Danny's.  I mean, he's a big-time company guy, and where has it gotten him?  Nowhere.  I know.  And we're the worst company guys.  Trying to be a little better, Danny.  We're trying a little bit.  You guys are doing a good job.  We're trying.  We're not as harsh lately.  No, you...  We're trying.  You play the role.  You guys do a great job of it.  What happened this morning?  No, I mean, like, starting from this morning, you're not as harsh lately.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I just always like being, you know, and you should be in the studio at least 15 minutes 
[00:37:00]  before your show starts.  So the guy coming, you know, before you, like last week when Sam was doing the show before  you guys came in, you know, he was on, and then, you know, he just wanted to make sure  that you guys were going to be there at your start time at 7 o'clock.  True.  I did make reference to that.  Yeah.  You should be there at least a half hour, 15 minutes, you know.  So if you're on the air at 6 o'clock, you should walk in at least 545.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Right, right.  That seems a little weird.  It's just, you know, professional courtesy.  That's strange.  Professional courtesy.  It's all part of being a professional broadcaster.  It's a rule of thumb. 
[00:37:30]  When I was at AEW, I really didn't like my relationship, so I got in like five hours  early.  Avoiding things at home?  Yep.  Yeah, we did get in early.  Now I'm in a very, very healthy relationship, so I get here and maybe, yeah, sometimes I'm  here 20 minutes before the show, Denny.  Oh, that's good.  No, that's great.  We don't have any problems with your work ethic around here.  Whoa.  Whoa, Denny.  Not at all.  Everyone back at the home office thinks you're doing a great job.  What about Before We Let You Go?  Yes.  I mean, it is Friday. 
[00:38:00]  We've never tackled the weekend song thing with you.  Aren't some of these songs hacked by now, like Working for the Weeknd?  It was another good one.  Remember Willie?  They had that great song called Weekend.  It was not a big hit, but it was a great song.  We got that one, he rocked.  Do what you want to do.  What are some of the, before he plays that, what are some of the other great...  Take this job, bitch.  Yeah, that's a big one.  I always like Bell and James living it up Friday night.  Living it up Friday night.  Oh, yeah.  I know, Bang on the Drum. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, that was a big hit.  Yeah, that one.  Friday, Friday.  Friday on my mind is basically a Monday song.  Oh, right.  Why?  Because Monday I've got Friday on my mind.  Oh, I see.  Right.  Right.  You can't have Friday on your mind if it is Friday.  The Beckham Black.  So, you know, when I'm scheduling music, especially for the 60s, I try not to play Monday, Monday  on Friday.  You want to keep people in a good mood.  As a listener, as a listener, Denny, I don't give a fuck.  Well, it's just a reference to that.  As a listener, this is the shit...  And, you know, you reference Monday. 
[00:39:00]  There's no reason on Friday afternoon to say, hey, don't forget, Monday morning, Opie  and Anthony are going to give you the chance to win tickets to see some and so in concert.  Early in my career, I was a music jock, okay?  Yeah.  Uh, I would argue this shit with program directors all the time.  The listener doesn't give a fuck.  If it's a cool song, it's a cool song.  It doesn't matter when you're playing it.  It doesn't matter.  Just try to get those people in the mood for the weekend.  Subliminal is how it works.  Is that right?  Exactly.  Right.  I had a PD that he was so obsessed with, like, Tuesday's Gone by, uh...  Yeah, yeah.  What's the other one by the Moody Blues? 
[00:39:30]  I think that's the one.  Tuesday afternoon.  Tuesday afternoon.  That's the one I'm actually thinking about.  Yeah.  He insisted that we had to play it on Tuesday.  Oh, my God.  I'm like, who gives a fuck?  No, I mean, not to play it six, uh, six days, the other six days.  Yeah.  Right.  If I heard Tuesday afternoon on a Friday, I'd be, oh, cool.  Right.  I'm listening to...  I like this song.  Moody Blues.  I'm not a big Moody Blues fan myself, but...  I've always been.  So, let's go with, uh, Tuesday's Gone by Leonard Skinner now.  I love that song.  It's a tune.  And I don't give a fuck that I hear it on a Thursday. 
[00:40:00]  Iraq, uh, Iraq's got a comment.  Is this part of Denny's playlist for the five o'clock whistle?  For the five o'clock whistle.  Yabba-dabba-doo!  It's all fun.  It's all fun.  You know, there are people who like that.  But they overthink it.  Yes.  It's just fun.  Yeah, but it's almost fun.  I'll give you, it's almost fun.  Almost.  Almost.  It's kind of goofy.  There's a lot of good things to back there.  Radio programming, it's worked.  Gotta grab my bowl.  Like what?  Gotta have serious... 
[00:40:30]  You get people, I mean, you're putting people into a good mood.  Especially when you come to a decade's channel.  In the 50s, 60s, 70s.  It puts people in a good mood.  It's all about a good mood.  It's all about a good mood.  It's like you're going to...  Well, I'm saying the listeners.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Not a stupid radio station.  No, no, no.  If they're doing well at their job, and the boss finally gives them a raise, that puts them  in a good mood.  Not hearing, uh, Tuesday's Gone on a Tuesday.  It's good times and great oldies, monkeys, and a Pleasant Valley Sunday.  You know, that puts you in a great summertime mood, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Does it?  I think so, sure. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Summertime, summer of love.  You know, just keep people in a good...  Good, fun, summertime.  It's all about good times and great oldies.  It's an escape, isn't it, Dennis?  It's an escape, exactly.  You know what I like?  Escape and entertainment.  On the 70s channel, here at SiriusXM Satellite Radio.  I love those retro Casey Kasem countdowns.  Those are great.  You get the top, American Top 40 from this week in 1976, and they'll count them down, and 
[00:41:30]  you're like, oh, I remember that.  Yeah.  I remember sitting in my Chevy Vega, you know, polishing it up and everything, and, you know...  He had the Chevy Vega.  Yeah.  He had the Chevy...  With the aluminum block.  Yeah.  And it cracked.  Oh, I did.  You were so long-eyed.  I love it.  Such an old-school long-eyed Vega.  Had the black racing stripe.  Oh, yeah.  You were styling.  Yeah, had that.  Had the FM converter going on.  Oh, sure.  You have to.  The FM converter.  To the AM radio to 1600, you'd plug in the FM converter. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  Now you're talking.  Now you're getting the radio in a tunnel.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  I mean, it's just phenomenal.  But Casey takes you right back, and he's...  Oh, yeah.  I did that with the 80s channel.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  MTV jocks.  And I'm like, why do I care what was the number one song in 1984?  And it's interesting.  I have to listen.  You think, you're like, oh, where was I?  Right.  What was I doing in my life when this song was number one?  Yeah, now, you know...  Before, I was getting ready for junior high school, I guess.  Oh.  Somewhere around there. 
[00:42:30]  Right, right.  I think.  I don't know.  I might be off by a year.  Buying those school supplies.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  Yep.  Really?  You know, like the other weekend.  It's all for the 80s, man.  Exactly.  Math.  I'm not sure.  All that stuff takes you back.  Well, your high school years, that's your formative years of music.  Yes, yes.  High school years.  High school and early college years.  Yeah, that's when I discovered Nirvana in high school.  Wow.  See that?  What?  Me too.  I hate pushing it.  What?  Were you late to the game?  I just looked like shit for my age.  What are you talking about?  Wow.  Nirvana.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Do you have your high school picture posted online somewhere?  Is that up there?  No.  Because that's good to put on the website.  Like, you know, one weekend, you know, put all your young pictures up there.  Oh, what was it?  That's always fun.  Throwback Thursday.  That was a big, long-round thing for stations.  The, oh, help me out, Danny.  The class reunion weekend.  Class reunion weekend.  Is that what it was officially called?  Yeah, it's a class reunion weekend, as we remember the class of 1974 this hour.  And you count down the top songs.  Ah, remember this?  Yeah.  A little history from 1974.  Hey, you might remember. 
[00:43:30]  Maybe you were watching what was going on in pop culture and the news.  Saturday morning, maybe you were watching the Cosby Kids, and over on ABC, they had  this, this, and that, and whatever, and it just brings people back.  I think it's all fun.  It's a similar time.  Well, yeah, yeah, because those were basically the good old days.  People get nostalgic, you know.  Yes, they do.  They forget the bad, remember the good.  So, those memories are always good.  And you bring them there, Danny.  As Carly Simon said, these are the good old days.  I'm glad you brought up Carly Simon.  I was going to tweet about her, because she's still obsessing about the, you're so vain 
[00:44:00]  shit.  And it came out again the other day, like, she's thinking about, you know, saying who the  song was about.  I'm like, fuck Carly Simon.  You're the one that's vain.  Yeah, right.  To think that we give a fuck about this.  After fucking 40 years.  40 years, I think.  And they're like, well, one time she says the name has an R in it.  Who gives a fuck?  Apparently she told Taylor Swift who the song's about.  Well, then how about Taylor Swift tweet it?  She's hiding it in that bathing suit of hers. 
[00:44:30]  That giant.  It's hidden right on her belly button.  No one will ever see it.  That bathing suit's weird, because it's like.  Horrendous.  It barely covers her pussy, but it goes all the way past her belly button.  What is that about?  Past her belly button.  That is weird shit.  The leg holes go too far down on her thighs.  It's terrible.  It's old school.  Look at her with that.  It is old school.  That's a Ned Funicello shit.  She should have.  I hate that bathing suit.  That's ridiculous.  She's wearing a bikini on.  It looks like she's wearing a regular bikini with a matching cumberbunch.  She should have the itsy-teeny. 
[00:45:00]  Itsy-missy.  Teeny-weeny.  With yellow polka-dum bikini.  Right.  Ryan Highland hit music.  Someone out there.  It took a long fucking time, but they figured out the bikini where even a shitty ass looks  way better, right?  Oh, yeah.  So why would you fuck with it and start moving the bottoms around again?  She tasks me.  She tasks me, and I shall have her for it.  They perfected the bikini.  Leave it alone.  Is that her with the regular bikini on? 
[00:45:30]  Uh, yeah.  Let me see.  Yeah, way better.  Look at that.  Way better.  Yeah, yeah.  She's got something going on with those hips, though.  They're very slender.  Well, she's got that.  She's very slender.  She is very slender.  She doesn't really have body parts.  Oh, that looks much better right there.  She has a lot of underdeveloped body parts.  That looks good right there.  I've got to give her that.  Not bad, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, what's the Denny song he was trying to turn us on to?  Wet Willie or something you said?  Yeah, Weekend.  That was a good tune.  Yeah, there you go.  I want to hear this. 
[00:46:00]  I want to talk it up from the back of the day.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  Start over.  Start over.  Denny, do you know this one?  Do you need a hot clock?  No, we still don't have the hot clock in here.  I don't know why.  And should we do the time check?  We haven't done a time check in years.  Top of the hour here.  Yeah, we haven't done one in years.  I like that Denny's also complaining about studio things that haven't gotten done.  Oh, we still don't have a hot clock in here.  We still don't have a hot clock in here.  Yeah, Denny.  He's like, it's his show now.  No, no, no.  I'm just saying. 
[00:46:30]  It's good to have one.  And by the way, Denny, it took us six months to get the console cleaned off.  Right.  I don't see a hot clock showing up here anytime soon.  No.  We should put a hot clock in here.  We really should.  The Dennis Falcone hot clock.  Oh, that would be great.  A hot clock and the plastic-covered list of all the channels.  And Ronnie can keep track of when Fez talks.  Oh.  With a hot talk.  A hot clock.  A hot clock.  Hot clock.  Hit that hot clock every time Fez pipes up.  Or just even a chalkboard or something to write down what channels you want to promote. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, we don't have the board in here.  Every studio used to have the bulletin board and the chalkboard.  And you'd put, you know, the big things that you're supposed to talk about.  How much was in the cash call jackpot?  Okay.  Nobody got it the last time, so we're going to add another $1.24 to it.  That's right.  Because if you were, like, on a frequency of $12.40 or $15.60, you wouldn't add $15.60.  You'd add $1.50.  Because the listener, once again, is paying close attention.  Just fucking put five bucks in it. 
[00:47:30]  Who cares?  The cash call jackpot is up to $33.43.  It's $33.  Could be in your pocket.  He is a walking, like, history, a walking museum of radio.  You are the radio museum.  You really are.  It's like you took a time machine.  Right.  And went back, and you're actually talking to a guy from back then.  What is, um, what was it called again?  The cash.  Cash call jackpot.  The cash call jackpot.  Yeah, that's right.  Now, if you know it, you know, we'll be coming up this afternoon on the ride home with Sam the Man Roberts. 
[00:48:00]  He'll tell you between, you know, any time between 2 and 6, it's like somebody's going to actually be sitting there.  You know?  From 2 to 6.  Any time after 2, kind of try to narrow it down, you know.  Come up between 2 and 3, at least.  Yeah.  Appointment listening.  Appointment listening.  Coming up between 2 and 3.  I'm so glad we don't have to deal with a few more ratings or TL, fucking time spent, TSL. 
[00:48:30]  TSL.  If somebody wanted to start a station up somewhere that was completely retro, you would absolutely be the fucking PD?  Well, it's fun.  It's fun.  It's fun.  Why don't you do an online station?  Oh, my God, right?  We'll push everybody to your online station.  No, no, no.  I have stations here that I work for.  I'm happy with promoting these stations.  Yeah, but how about you put a little money in your pocket?  Oh, I do okay.  Let's cut the middleman out.  Well, that's why I enjoy doing the mobile DJ, bringing the party to you every weekend. 
[00:49:00]  What's that website, Denny?  DennisFalcone.com.  Are you booked for the summer?  Yeah, things are filling up.  Nice.  Things are filling up.  Yeah, things are filling up.  Very cool.  I love when he talks about promotions, like the cash call, whatever, jackpot, because he  says it, and then he does the tagline, and you know he's done that to himself in the  car like 150 times, and you have it ready to go.  Oh, sure.  It's always fun.  It's always fun to play.  It's always fun.  It's just fun for you.  I was brought up with radio knowing from an early age I wanted to do this, and I never 
[00:49:30]  fucking called a radio station.  For contests?  No, neither did.  I never did.  I just called them for jobs.  Oh, I did.  We called those people contest pigs, and you know what I'm saying, Denny.  Yeah.  I had a general manager.  I said that once to a general manager, and he goes, we like to call them repeat customers.  Oh, no.  They were known in the business as contest pigs.  Every Friday afternoon, what are you guys giving away this weekend?  Right.  You knew their phone number.  You knew their names.  You knew everything about them.  If you were a member of your family, he has won anything in the past 30 days.  Right.  And we had to write down the contest pigs' names and phone numbers because we would 
[00:50:00]  go over the list and go, all right, Debbie, you fucking won last week, Debbie.  You just know their voices.  You knew everything about them.  Yeah.  I love who you guys did.  They were the only ones calling, and then they really got into where they would set up  all different phone lines and everything in their house.  Oh, yeah.  When you guys were at K-Rock and you took over their phone lines, and you started asking people  if they were prize pigs.  Prize pig?  You suck cock for K-Rock?  Suck cock for K-Rock.  That's how we wanted the phones to be.  Put that on the podcast next week. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Is it a funny bit?  Yeah, it's really funny.  Suck cock for K-Rock is the best.  Suck cock for K-Rock.  So why don't we play it today?  How long is it?  It's long.  Oh, that was a good one.  Save it for the internet.  Oh, my God.  Well, could you give the people a taste after the break, and then we'll put it on next week's  podcast?  All right.  Let me see how long it is.  I always like the radio station.  Figure it out during the break, and then we'll play it after we come back.  See, I just teased something.  Yes, you did.  I like that.  That was good.  I used to call up, though.  I used to call up to get on the air, though.  I wanted to get on the air, so I'd do imitations and things. 
[00:51:00]  But I did call for a prize once, and I won.  Nice.  I called Jerry Martir over there at BAB for a BAB, a genuine WBAB graffiti sweatshirt.  Nice.  And it was a yellow sweatshirt.  Sweet.  And it had a print on it of all the jocks and little, like, talk bubbles and things like  that the station was known for.  Long Island's home of rock and roll, it said.  And then it had, like, fingers in the van. 
[00:51:30]  Remember, fingers?  Sure.  And it said it had the, what was the thing with the local bands they used to have?  Homegrown.  Homegrown.  BAB Homegrown.  It was all that shit.  Homegrown.  It was a BAB graffiti sweatshirt.  I was so happy to get it.  I had to drive to the station to get it, though.  There's no way you ever wore it out in public, though.  I did.  There's a picture of me wearing it.  Wow.  Where?  It's, I think, I think in my Facebook picture, everyone tagged me or something. 
[00:52:00]  I'm in Los Angeles.  I think I was in Hollywood.  I was at the Hollywood Wax Museum.  I'm standing in front of a wax figure of Bob Hope with a giant afro and my BAB graffiti  sweatshirt.  Damn.  I don't remember Bob Hope with an afro.  Well, no, I had the afro.  Very funny, Denny.  Oh, Denny.  That's good.  Denny with a little fucking zinger.  See?  And it wasn't blue.  He could think on his feet, too.  You gotta think on your feet.  Yeah, she did.  When these mics are on.  Good luck sorting through the eight billion pictures that I've tagged in.  Do you keep that radio sweatshirt in your radio room?  You don't have a radio room back in your place. 
[00:52:30]  I had a radio room, Denny.  Well, I didn't have a radio room, but I had all the stuff I would have put in my radio room.  That stuff ended up in, you know what the radio room turned into?  The fireplace during my divorce.  Yeah, he lost all his shit.  Yeah.  She got the gold mine, you got the shaft.  What song is that?  Jerry Reed.  Jerry Reed, of course.  We used to win radio awards and everything.  Yeah.  I had mine all set up until I decided to have kids, and that became the baby room, Denny. 
[00:53:00]  Ah.  My career.  If you walked in my house, you would never know I'm in radio.  Wow.  It's all in boxes.  Well, you don't have a regular.  You live in the city, right?  You live in...  Yeah.  I live in the city, all right.  I was very excited about my...  I actually was very excited about my WAAF ski jacket.  It was the first, you know, my first radio gig.  I was very proud to wear the calls on the back in that day.  You know, it was great.  And she took it down to the fucking Goodwill bins. 
[00:53:30]  Wow.  And some homeless guy was probably walking around to this day with a tattered AAF ski  jacket with Anthony embroidered on the front.  She wanted to make it hurt.  She did.  Yeah.  I like all that stuff.  The hats and the t-shirts.  And you didn't...  The swag.  You didn't stop calling radio shows when you got into radio.  Well, you got the big man cow.  Yeah.  Just ask man cow.  You're still a contributor.  That was an amazing phone. 
[00:54:00]  Wow.  That's a really good point.  I was a second away from turning that into gold.  Right.  And then I just turned out to be a good caller.  Wow.  That's a really good point.  That's a great point.  Yes.  Hit it.  Click.  He even lowered his voice.  Wow.  That's a really good point.  I'm a good radio caller.  I was a really good call-in caller.  And that was in the day before cell phones.  I used to have to pull up to...  On the Northern State Parkway.  I knew there was a...  Pay phone.  There was a pay phone.  And it was one of those...  You could pull your car right up to it. 
[00:54:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And bring the receiver in the window and feel like you're on a car phone.  That's so fucked up.  And I would call up morning shows and do impressions.  Cell phones are great, you know, because you were able to get more callers.  But how many times...  I mean, sorry, we have to let you go.  You have a bad line.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  E-Rock.  Did you ever put bumper stickers on your car so that the Super Sticker Patrol would pull  you over and give you, like, money on the highway?  God, no.  I think I did have a WNBC... 
[00:55:00]  Going to make me rich sticker?  Going to make me rich sticker.  With the Sprite logo on it.  Holy shit!  Well, you had to answer your phone.  WNBC is going to make me rich.  If you answer your phone...  You're right.  Yeah.  WNBC is going to make me rich.  I had one.  But the station thought that would turn people onto listening to the station.  You know the only time that...  It doesn't work.  It would keep them...  None of that works.  There's one time it works.  What?  When the bumper sticker doesn't get you money, it gets you tits to look at.  Well, that's true.  Then it works.  That works.  It's got...  Because that was a real prize. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  Right.  And we gave away a shitload of prizes that way.  The only prize for having the sticker was that girls would flash their tits at you.  And it happened all the time.  Right.  So it was great.  And we started out as a goof, thinking there's no way, and it just fucking exploded.  But...  Yeah.  WNBC is going to make me rich.  Wow.  That's fucking ancient.  Like the Fugitive.  That bit they're doing over and over again on regular radio.  They think that's going to drive people to listen to the station.  It's not...  I would love to see the ratings of all those stations that tried that bit. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Well, if you go to the store, you might see me.  Right.  I am in the aisle where rice is being sold, and who gives a shit?  And they want the whole community to run up to strangers saying the call letters of  a station, and that stranger now is going to go, oh, wow, I've got to listen to that.  Can I tune that in?  No, it doesn't work, Danny.  No.  I don't think it works at all.  You know what works?  Good, solid radio. 
[00:56:30]  That's right.  Content.  Good content.  It's all about the content.  Content is king, right, Danny?  Content is king.  And a jock who's like your friend.  Yes.  Exactly.  A companion.  Sharing his music with you.  Sharing some thoughts.  Someone you'd like to go out to lunch with.  Why does every jock have the exact same music?  Oh, boy.  They have the exact same music.  E-Rock's got a sample of the K-Rock bit?  Oh.  Yeah, it's about 220.  We miss these days when we were on regular radio. 
[00:57:00]  You know, all the phone numbers for the radio stations were very close to each other, so  you always got someone misdialing and getting us.  Yeah.  I miss that.  I think on this one, we were using K-Rock Studio.  Right.  Because the XM Studio was under construction.  Right.  And so the phone lines for K-Rock...  Would still ring.  ...would light up in our studio, so you would pick it up before the jock would in the other  studio.  And they would be giving away, like, Red Hot Chili Peppers tickets or some dumb thing.  They would be running a contest.  We'd see the lines ringing like crazy, and we got to them before the jock did. 
[00:57:30]  Yes.  Okay.  I don't even know if this is good, to be honest with you.  It is.  I remember it.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  A little sample.  Just the phrase that pays, and Ted Nugent will kick you in the cunt.  Come on.  K-Rock rocks.  Come on.  That's not the phrase that pays you, fucking...  You silly, titless nothing.  What's the girl's name?  We got an idea from Nate Sack.  Girl's name, what's your name?  Pat.  Hey, Pat, can you repeat after me?  I suck cock for K-Rock.  I suck cock for K-Rock? 
[00:58:00]  No.  I suck cock for K-Rock.  You hear it perfectly, except for the word cock.  Dumb reeks.  What?  You can't put that on the radio.  Yes, you can.  We're going to beep it.  It's okay.  Yeah, we're trying to be a little edgier with the station, so we'll bleep that part.  So after me.  I suck cock for K-Rock.  I suck what for K-Rock?  Again, perfect pitch hearing, except for the thing that's constantly in her mouth.  I'm a professional DJ.  Repeat after me.  Are you ready?  Okay. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  I suck cock for K-Rock.  I suck cock for K-Rock.  Wow.  You're bad.  You're bad.  Sir, it's your turn.  My daughter and my daughter.  All right.  All right.  Now, wait a minute.  Let's let the other guy get an opportunity.  Now the guy has to say it.  What's your guy?  What's your name, sir?  You talking to me now, Farron?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's your name?  My name is Lenny, man.  Give us a sip of guys' cock.  I'm going to get some laughs out of you guys.  I'm not getting some tickets, obviously, but at least it's just entertaining.  Well, Lenny, why don't we do this?  Why don't you repeat after me, okay? 
[00:59:00]  I suck cock for K-Rock.  I refuse to say that, man.  Hell no.  You don't want the tickets, then?  I want them.  I want them.  Hold on, you silly hole.  We're talking to Lenny.  Pat's going to get the tickets unless you say the phrase, Lenny.  I'm not saying that phrase.  I'll say any other phrases at that.  I don't go that way.  All right.  How about...  We've got tickets.  We've got backstage passes.  We also got a limo to and from the show.  And your mother's cunt in a box.  Yeah.  And then we're going to fuck you with a broomstick. 
[00:59:30]  Or a broom.  Or if we have a broom, we'll use that.  A broom.  The fuck is that?  B-R-U-M?  Do you have a broom?  All right.  We obviously got a...  We obviously got a problem here.  We got two winners on the line.  We can only give it to one.  All right.  Whoever...  My husband and my son would kill me if this makes it on the radio.  Really?  You shouldn't have said it, then, you fucking titless junk.  Danny?  I bet you don't like that.  You guys got to be nice to the listeners.  There's a lot of things going on there.  We're working blue and we're not being nice to the listeners. 
[01:00:00]  We're not being nice.  We're not being honest with our contest rules.  I don't know what's worse.  You must be having a stroke over there.  That was terrible.  Listening to that.  That was a bad one.  You got to be nice to the listeners.  And even worse, Danny, there were no tickets to give away.  Yeah.  No, that's a shame.  So we're breaking all sorts of rules.  All kinds of rules.  FCC is going to be knocking down your door.  God, Bob Kelly was in that day for the bid and Louis CK?  Louis CK.  Yeah, we should cut that up for the next podcast.  That was funny.  Did you see Denny's glasses case?  No.  What does it say?  How did you get SiriusXM?  Oh, it's a sticker on there.  It's just a sticker.  Oh, I made it.  Stick it in Witten. 
[01:00:30]  Why would you have a SiriusXM sticker on your eyeglass case?  Looks cool, doesn't it?  Not really.  It's good.  You know how many people in the office?  And he's got the SiriusXM hat on.  People said, hey, where'd you get that case?  Yeah.  Zero.  I said, Scott.  Scott Greenstein.  Oh, nice.  Oh, that presented it to you.  Yes, yes.  The next podcast, I want the Suck Cock for K-Rock.  And then other times, we've fucked with listeners from other radio stations.  We can maybe have a nice theme.  Oh, I like a good theme.  What do you think?  We got other bits that we can throw in there?  Let me look.  Thematic radio. 
[01:01:00]  My favorite, but you've really got to invest the time.  At N.E.W., we had a girl call in for, what were the tickets for?  The Hello Lady.  Oh, Hello Antoinette.  Antoinette, her name was right.  It was probably like, it was a pop band.  I think it was like NSYNC.  No, it's the dude that fucking, oh, fuck.  Was on a soap opera.  Rick Springfield.  Rick Springfield tickets.  Thank you.  Jesus.  Dr. Noah Drake from General Hospital.  She called for stupid Rick Springfield tickets out of anything. 
[01:01:30]  She was obviously listening to another radio station.  Rick Springfield, somebody of mine.  Called N.E.W. instead.  Jesse's girl, I'm so jealous, jealous.  Jesse's girl, she should be with me.  I think the bosses almost had heart attacks.  Because for an hour straight, this was N.E.W., for an hour straight, we just had her saying  hello, trying to make sure we didn't hang up on her because she wanted the tickets so bad.  And the whole time we're like, yeah, we kind of hear her, but her phone's bad. 
[01:02:00]  And she starts screaming, hello, hello, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.  You left her on live during the commercials.  Right.  Yes.  You got to commit to the bit.  It's an hour.  I think it's an hour that she was on yelling.  Wow.  She said hello well over, I would say, close to a thousand times.  Oh, my God.  I hope you gave her something.  No.  Oh, we did.  All right.  The old hanger-upper.  There was no payoff there.  Maybe we could throw it on the podcast at the end and just make less.  No?  That's a big nugget.  Oh, yeah.  We can't touch that material, really, right?  Nugget. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, we can't touch that material yet.  Can't touch this.  Yeah, NAW wants, like, hundreds of thousands of dollars for our old material.  For our brilliance.  Minus the commercials that you guys had on Terrestrial, that bit alone was 42 minutes.  Yeah.  Wow.  We backed up all the commercials and everything.  It went on forever.  Wow.  We just did not let her off the hook.  And she didn't get the Rick Springfield tickets.  No.  You guys were so much better back then.  Can we play Donna Summer on the space shuttle going into bed? 
[01:03:00]  Donna Summer.  That's an oldie but goodie.  Oh, I remember that one.  We gave away a trip to the space shuttle to see Donna Summer.  That's nice, right?  Nice, yeah.  That's good, right?  Decorate it all up.  Oh, you didn't do Wet Willie either.  Okay.  Iraq is working overtime.  Oh, that's right.  We wanted you to talk it up.  Did we do Wet Willie?  This is one of the weekend songs.  Weekend songs.  That's Friday.  Then he suggests.  Well, good morning.  720 Eastern Time, 420 on the left coast.  Dennis Falcone, your professional radio disc jockey, sitting in this morning having fun 
[01:03:30]  with Opie and Anthony gearing you up for the weekend.  Hopefully you're going to have yourself a great one.  Take us to the beach, the boat, the park, wherever you're going.  Wet Willie's here.  Let's do it.  It's weekend, baby.  Oh, wow.  Smooth.  Fucking silk.  Smooth.  Too bad the voice isn't that great.  I hate it, man.  Oh, Jesus, Opie.  I noticed that.  Look who's talking.  I know.  Sam, my voice keeps me out of Radio Roberts.  It's true.  Keeps me out of the big gig.  The big fucking gigs. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, I know.  Sam was told that, you know, personality's there, but the voice sucks.  Yeah.  I know a good voice when I hear it, and it's not on my demos.  Oh, is it entertainment?  Entertainment Weekly.  Entertainment Weekly.  Didn't have the voice for it.  Jesus.  How are they doing over there?  No one's talking about them.  No, terrible.  They could have had Sam Roberts pumping them up.  No one's listening.  No one calls that show.  No one calls that show?  We can see them here during our show, and we can see their phone screening.  Nobody calls.  No one's calling.  It's too bad.  It would be if I was on. 
[01:04:30]  It's too bad.  I want all channels to do well, Danny.  Very good.  I like that.  That's right.  There you go.  Did a chick lose weight?  They're all brothers and sisters.  That girl that was...  Remember the fatty girl on Pal Talk?  Yeah.  Showed her tits?  I think she lost a little weight.  How much?  Not enough.  She's got to lose weight.  18 pounds?  But yeah.  Hey, miss, don't give a fuck.  Dance around again.  Show your ass.  I think she lost a little weight.  Back up.  Let me see.  What do you think of this guy?  Yeah.  Is she right?  Didn't she lose some weight? 
[01:05:00]  Looking good.  I think I would hit that ass.  It almost looks like a hiney.  That fucking...  And you get a little bonus of that big titty fuck.  Yes.  Nice.  But it does smell like rotten onions under their breasts.  Oh, Jesus.  They don't take care of themselves.  They got to fucking put deodorant under their tits sometimes.  Yeah.  Oh, it smells like garbage sometimes.  Oh, God.  You like that, Danny?  You like that garbage?  Danny doesn't like any of this garbage smell.  You lift up a big boob and it just releases odors that have been trapped there for a long time. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, no.  I'm not saying it's happening with her.  No, she looks very clean.  It looks like she puts a little deodorant under her boobs.  You like a chubby girl every now and then, Danny?  What's that?  Nice little chubby girl for yourself?  No.  You know, this chick, I can tell she'd probably look good.  She looks all right.  She'd probably...  You know what?  She's looking good here.  How about we encourage her?  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Because I think she's one of those that, like, has a pretty face. 
[01:06:00]  You know, they go, she's got such a pretty face.  Right.  And then, you know, but they're fucking fine.  Are you a chubby chaser, Danny?  No.  Every now and then.  Have you ever knocked back a chubby?  No.  Not once?  No.  They give you good rides.  They work a little harder, Danny.  They do a little extra, Danny.  They got to try a little harder.  You don't make fun of large women, especially on the radio.  I was working at a country station once.  I was working at a country station once, and Rosie O'Donnell came out with a Christmas  album.  Oh. 
[01:06:30]  And...  You're going to be playing that?  I put it on the list yesterday for your big Christmas special.  It might be a tertiary or a lunar song.  To make fun of the fact that she's a flat song.  And I said something.  It was her and I think Trisha Yearwood were on one of the songs.  And I said, boy, it must have been hard to get to the buffet table when they were recording.  Wow.  Danny!  And the phones.  I thought I was being this zany young DJ.  Yeah, yeah.  The phones went like...  Did you apologize?  All ten lines.  Did you apologize?  No, I just didn't answer the phones.  You are a shock jock.  You are a shock jock. 
[01:07:00]  Danny was a shock jock.  But you didn't...  And then the next DJ came in and he said, you never make fun of large women in country  radio.  Oh, man.  Or any radio for that matter.  I said, okay.  You didn't see the sign.  You got a reaction.  Yeah, I know.  This is all about getting a reaction.  Yeah, but I didn't want to make the people feel bad.  Good or bad.  I just thought I was being a wise guy.  You were.  I was.  You were all right.  For one second, he had that reaction.  And then he got scared of it.  You got scared of it.  You did.  That's not me.  Man's got to know his limitations.  And then he went back to reading liner cards. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  It's delivering.  Stupid effing liner cards.  No, no.  It's all the way you say it.  Remember liner cards?  Oh, they were the worst.  Oh, my God.  I would read that shit going...  No one's going to the gas station to get a dumb fucking rose.  Valentine's Day.  We're going to be giving away roses at the Gulf Station on 25A.  Yeah.  I would be there.  And I would know everyone that showed up because they would show up to all the dumb stuff.  They were the only people that would show up to that crap.  Yeah, but you get to meet the listeners.  A lot of people coming in.  I love meeting listeners, but I don't like meeting the same exact listeners a hundred times. 
[01:08:00]  And that's what you got back then.  Yeah.  The same fucking people.  So, Denny, guys like us can't read liner cards.  We've got to rely on our personalities.  I don't read them.  I deliver them.  It's delivering the liner cards.  Denny, we don't have good voices.  We can't deliver them.  How do you deliver a liner card?  You're right.  Well, it's the way you say it.  If you just say, you know, cool 100 playing today's greatest hits.  Yesterday's favorites.  It's all the way you say it.  It's cool 100 playing yesterday's hits. 
[01:08:30]  Listen, I've got this one for you.  It's all the way.  Party at the 55 degrees.  And I've got a clear night lined up for you.  It's the station that plays your favorite oldies.  Just, you know.  And you have to make it sound like it's part of the conversation, right?  Yeah.  Like if you're reading a liner about an event that's going on, a station event, you can't  make it sound like you're reading it.  No.  You've got to work it into the conversation.  Sure.  We can have Denny deliver a live read for us.  Wow.  That's all right.  Sorry, Denny.  It's okay. 
[01:09:00]  I mean, yeah, that sounds good.  Maybe later, though?  Yeah.  Maybe on your show.  All right, Denny.  Okay.  Hey, thank you very much for the time.  I do appreciate it.  Oh, Denny.  Always a pleasure.  It certainly is.  Have you in here.  Like I said, walking history.  I like talking radio with Denny.  It is.  I love talking radio.  He brings back a lot of memories.  I think it's all bullshit, but I love talking about it.  Yeah.  And you guys don't have like a closing thing.  I mean, you have opening music.  You don't have going.  Oh, Denny wants to close it?  You want to grab a closing music.  Instead of the listeners wondering for 10 minutes.  If we're coming back or not, you think that's bad? 
[01:09:30]  Or you should just have a, you know, like, we were on, now we're gone.  Next time we get together, I'll bring the coffee.  No need for the sugar because you, you're sweet enough.  Happy summer.  Great weekend.  Don't point to me when you say that.  He pointed to Sam.  Oh, is that fantastic?  I wasn't blowing kisses at you or anything.  Oh, he is the greatest.  Oh, God.  God.  All right.  You got Donna Summer on the space shuttle.  We haven't played this in a while.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:10:00]  Believe it or not, this is us.  Our voices are a little different.  Oh, that's right.  I got to hear the voices.  We used to love messing with listeners from other radio stations.  When we get back, we got Wiener's Pig talking on Inside Edition.  And I saw Flavor Flav on TV last night.  Oh, shit.  That couples therapy show on VH1.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen that show.  That's on in my household and I took a peek.  Flavor Flav is out of his fucking mind.  I want you to find one clip from last night's show, okay?  The big fight. 
[01:10:30]  You can try.  That he had with the girls gone wild, dude.  Okay.  But the reason they fought is hilarious.  Yes.  I'll explain next, but first this.  Am I the right caller?  What were you calling for?  Donna Summer tickets.  Donna Summer tickets.  Are you a big Donna Summer's fan?  Yes, but I'm more of a 0.5 fan.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  She knows the right things to say.  There we go.  Let me tell you something.  You're going to see Donna Summer. 
[01:11:00]  You're kidding.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Matter of fact, we're going to put you in the front row.  What do you say?  endlich for Donna Summer.  What do you say?  I don't believe it.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Hey, what color panties are you wearing?  I'm wearing a bathing suit.  Donna Summer wants to know.  What kind of bathing suit are you wearing?  A one-piece, a thong, bikini?  A bikini.  I'm suntanning.  Suntanning.  And I'm by my pool with my radio with 0.5 on. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, boy.  Hey, she says it again.  Look at that.  Since she's mentioned the station so many times, I think another prize is in order.  You like the disco era?  Yes, I do.  The whole disco dancing thing?  Absolutely.  How about a disco weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada?  Yeah!  That's right.  You'll be whisked away to Las Vegas, Nevada to see Donna Summer in Las Vegas.  Are you serious?  We are serious.  I can't believe this.  You just have to tell us one thing.  What? 
[01:12:00]  What's the strangest object you've ever used during sex?  The what?  Donna wants to know.  Nothing.  You're a virgin.  No.  You're a big, fat virgin.  Yeah!  You're a big, fat virgin.  And what's your favorite station?  0.5.  She said it again.  You know what you're going to win now?  What?  A trip on the space shuttle.  Yeah!  The first person in space.  You're going to see Donna Summer on the space shuttle.  Isn't this fantastic? 
[01:12:30]  Oh, this is wonderful.  Have you ever been on the space shuttle?  No, I haven't.  Have you?  Oh, it's beautiful.  Yes!  Fantastic.  It's going to have a big disco ball.  Mm-hmm.  They're going to decorate it all.  Hey, do you know how to dial a phone?  Yes.  What's your favorite sexual position?  Hello?  Donna wants to know.  Hello?  Oh, no.  Did she hang up finally?  She's gone.  Oh, my God. 
[01:13:00]  It took forever.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  O.P.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah!  Base!  How low can you go?  Death Row?  What a brother no.  Once again, back here's the incredible.  Rhyme Animal, the Uncannibal. 
[01:13:30]  Steve!  Public Enemy number one.  My bull said,  Freeze!  And I got young.  Then I told him that I really never had a gun.  But it's the way to the Terminator X fund.  Now he got me in a cell for my record state cell.  Cause a brother like me said,  Well,  Barrett of the property.  And I think you want to listen to what he can say to you.  What you ought to do in a while.  But now,  tell all the people say,  Make a miracle.  I used to like some Public Enemy.  Back all in.  We're going to check it out.  Yeah, yeah, come on.  Here we go again.  It scared me,  but I liked it.  Being a dumb white kid from Long Island.  I liked it a little harder. 
[01:14:00]  With no street cred.  A little harder.  Yeah,  like fucking Eazy-E.  Right.  Some of that good shit.  Ghetto Boys.  This was good though.  Old school.  I just love his voice.  They were smart.  Cause they added in the guitar.  Yeah.  That was later on.  My kids were like,  yeah.  That was later on, right?  Yeah, this is with Anthrax. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  Oh, okay.  Honestly,  I don't remember this one.  This is big.  I know.  This is fucking really good.  I do know that,  but I just don't know it.  Oh,  Uncle Cracker is down at the Fox.  That's who it is?  Yeah.  Uncle Cracker's lost some weight.  Uncle Cracker.  Nice.  Uncle Cracker.  Lee and Uncle Cracker.  Next up on the rundown,  Jody Foster.  Kind of looked over like Uncle Cracker.  Uncle Cracker.  Crack-ass Cracker. 
[01:15:00]  Anyway,  where are we at?  Oh,  so Flavor Flav is on this new VH1 show.  I don't know if it's new,  but it's on in my house,  so I've taken a look.  It's called Couples Therapy.  And I don't know how this went down,  but Flavor Flav has a girlfriend.  They're having problems,  and there's other couples having problems,  so they decided,  let's tell the world we're having problems  because we really want to be famous.  Right.  These fucking shows.  And I guess Flavor Flav,  I'm not really sure, 
[01:15:30]  but his girl gained a bunch of weight,  and then he finally realized that she's pregnant.  Oh, shit.  But she's like six months pregnant,  but he's finding out for the first time.  Come on.  I think,  or he's just making believe that she wasn't pregnant,  and I don't know.  But it leads to this massive fight  they had on the show last night  because now Flavor Flav wants to make it a thing.  He tells all the couples  to gather in, I guess,  the kitchen area  because he has a big announcement.  Look out.  And he wants to announce to the house 
[01:16:00]  that his very obvious pregnant girlfriend  is pregnant.  And the dude from Girls Gone Wild,  who's a whack job himself,  Joe, I think his name is?  Joe Francis.  Joe Francis.  That fucking scumbag.  He pretty much calls Flavor Flav out,  like,  what the fuck?  We don't want to be part of your stupid sideshow.  Of course she's pregnant.  We all know she's pregnant.  She could pretty much have the baby any day now.  What are you talking about  by announcing this now? 
[01:16:30]  And here's some audio of the fight.  It was pretty good last night.  We like you, Flav,  and we're going to hear what you have to say.  We like you too, Joe,  and I really want you to hear what I have to say.  You know what I'm saying?  To everyone in here,  Liz has been, you know, very moody.  Flavor Flav is made for these goofy shows,  by the way.  Of course.  Because he's holding a platter of chocolate strawberries  because not only is he going to announce  that his six-month pregnant girlfriend is pregnant, 
[01:17:00]  he got a tray of chocolate strawberries  to celebrate the occasion  that he's holding as he announces this.  That's a nice guy.  And he is still wearing his clock.  Of course he is.  Yeah.  Holding on,  and I just wanted you guys to know why.  Wait, we're just getting to hear what you have to say,  but we just think you've been incredibly,  and Liz has been incredibly disrespectful to the house.  How?  Hey, just let him see what he's going to say.  Go ahead.  Okay, no, we're here to listen to you.  It's okay.  You're entitled to your opinion.  We're here to listen to you, Flav.  Go ahead. 
[01:17:30]  Even though I did kind of mention why,  but we weren't sure when we first got here.  Pause.  You know what I'm saying?  Okay.  Sorry to keep pausing.  We'll let it fly.  We'll let it fly in a second.  Okay, because I wasn't sure.  He wasn't sure that his six-month pregnant girlfriend was pregnant until recently,  meaning I believe a few hours before this was taped.  Uh-huh.  How do you not know your girlfriend is six months pregnant?  I just wish there were ways that you could confirm that.  Right?  You know?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:18:00]  He does say on the tape that they weren't sure,  but now they are sure.  That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.  She's in her second trimester.  How could you not know?  I know.  Second trimester.  It's been six months.  Sorry.  I just had to say that.  It's six months.  Don't come in here.  Hey, yo.  Hey, yo.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Let me tell you.  The music is all on.  Yo, yo, yo.  Wait a minute.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Yo, Francis.  I'm done with your sidesh***.  With your sideshow.  I'm not going to look at your sideshow.  She's only 10 weeks.  Don't calm yourself. 
[01:18:30]  Now.  Walk out.  Walk out.  Walk out.  Walk out.  She's in her second trimester.  Hey, yo.  She's 10 weeks.  Will you come out at me like that, Joe?  Yo, dicks.  Yo, I ain't seen the pictures.  Who are the rest of these people?  I'm not going to be doing that.  Bull****.  Strawberry.  Bull****.  Strawberry bullshit.  Strawberry bullshit.  Coming up.  Please, shut up.  Go f***, boss. 
[01:19:00]  Who are the rest of these people?  They're just almost celebrities with couples.  But I mean, they've really gone downhill as far as who.  Like, who are they?  Do you know?  One is a teen pregnant mom or whatever, right?  Yeah, the couple from Teen Mom.  That's what that kid was.  Teen Mom, whatever the f***.  Who gave up their kid.  Right.  Yes.  Because I saw one of them.  I'm like, that guy looks familiar.  And the rest of them, I don't know.  Chingy.  Rapper named Chingy.  Oh, Chingy.  What's up with Chingy?  He's having problems in his relationship. 
[01:19:30]  A couple who met on The Real World is on the show.  Oh, okay.  Who's that chick right there?  I think that's Joe Francis' woman.  Who he treats like shit.  Oh, God.  That's hard to believe.  So.  And then the second half of the fight.  Here's the second half of the fight.  She's in her second trimester.  How could you not know?  I know.  Second trimester.  It's been six months.  Sorry.  I just didn't know what.  You all come in here.  Hey, yo.  Hey, yo.  All right.  All right.  Well, let me tell you.  What the f***?  I'm tired of you now.  Yo, yo, yo. 
[01:20:00]  Wait a minute.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Yo, f***.  Francis.  I'm done with your side s***.  With your side show.  I'm not going to blow the f***.  She's only 10 weeks.  You'll calm yourself.  Walk out, walk out, walk out.  She's in her second trimester.  She's in me.  She's in me.  Why does he give a s***?  I'm not an ass.  Joe Francis.  I'm not going to be j***ed.  Like, why is he getting so upset?  He's tired of his strawberry bulls***.  This is a non-fight. 
[01:20:30]  Well, because Flavor Flav is like, you know, it's all about him and his chick and everyone.  It's not a reality show.  It's all about everybody.  He's making a moment out of the fact that his girlfriend is pregnant, but everyone already  knows it.  So, so.  I can understand.  So he's basically, Flavor Flav is basically wasting everyone's time in the house with  bullshit.  Like, strawberry bullshit.  Strawberry bullshit, because he got the chocolate strawberries for the big announcement.  I can understand laughing and going like, Flav, we all know.  Right.  You're a crazy person.  Right.  Why would Joe Francis get roid rage pissed? 
[01:21:00]  Oh, because that's his issues.  He's a f***ing lunatic.  All right.  This guy is a lunatic.  Because this is not, like, you shouldn't react like this over this.  I'm sure there was other shit that went down.  I'm sure Flavor Flav is not easy to deal with.  He doesn't like being stuck in the house with him, and he doesn't like Flav turning everything  into a party.  Exactly.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  So play that some more there.  Strawberry bullshit.  Well, take your f***ing ass. 
[01:21:30]  Take your f***ing ass to bed.  Really?  And I've got a f***ing message for you.  He's aware of what you're going to f***ing message.  She just called out the truth.  I called out the truth.  I called out.  I saw it.  Jesus.  I think you are arrogant.  I've got a lot of f***ing money.  I think you've done my experience with your girls for f***ing money.  He's disgusting.  I don't give a f***ing отв***.  What?  You're a piece of f***.  You're a piece of f***.  And I've got a f***ing message for you.  Run my man round, Pope PP.  Bend over and get the f***ing soap, you f***ing ass.  Don't lie to sight.  She's pregnant. 
[01:22:00]  No.  Yo, we got a brand new name for you.  Dickface me.  Dickface Joe?  You're a f***ing liar.  Dickface Joe.  He's not lying.  Please, shut the f*** up.  That's his name.  Dickface Joe.  That's his f***ing name.  Everyone else is just looking at him.  Everybody that sees Joe Francis, call him Dickface Joe.  That's his f***ing name.  Okay, we're the f***ing guy.  That's his f***ing name.  Yeah.  That's his f***ing name.  You're what?  She threw the strawberries away. 
[01:22:30]  Get out of here, you f***ing ass.  F***ing them away.  Abby ran over and got the strawberries and she proceeded to throw them all in the trash can.  This little Abby we loved, now it's turned into Bill and Joe.  This is...  Bill and Joe Jr.  ...so f***ing name.  Oh really?  Cause she called out your f***ing lies.  It's f***ing lies.  You're disgusting, smelly.  You smell like f***ing.  You don't shower.  She doesn't shower.  Well I'm f***ing shemas.  Love you, and I don't... 
[01:23:00]  I'm never...  I do shower.  I'm neverρο...  I'm...  You're s***ing j*****-  He's yelling, I do shower.  I do shower.  It's like little kid's arguing.  How bad...  How bad does Joe wanna drop it?  Oh yeah, yeah.  Right?  How bad does he wanna f***ing drop...  ...drop the n-word?  Yeah, guys.  Ah, yeah.  Your ass.  Your ass.  You smell like your shower.  Your mother smell like...  Ah, this is really mature. 
[01:23:30]  They're just...  They're immature.  That's why.  Oh.  And that's the teen mom saying that.  Right.  I think Joe was this over Flavin' Liz.  I think he's just had it.  And I get it.  I get it.  This is the first strike I have for Joe.  Because the sideshow that he hates so much.  He created it.  This stupid kid.  This is the first strike.  Like, Joe's worried about how many strikes he has.  Of course.  He's gonna have.  In this dumb fucking show.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I got a strike with the kid from Teen Mom on the dumb couple therapy show. 
[01:24:00]  Exactly.  They're the couple where the girl was like, with the braces.  We had to give away our child.  But I still want to be with her.  Fucking awful.  A season of Dramatics.  If they gave up the kid first episode.  Yeah.  And then there's a season in TV where it's just them harassing the fucking family.  You can tell the mother and father, the new ones, the adopted ones, wanted nothing to do with them. 
[01:24:30]  They drive up.  Oh, we're here.  I get to see Carly.  Or whatever her fucking name is.  I remember that one.  Your old friend's, like, throwing out his strawberries.  Right.  Yeah, what'd you do that for?  Could be the dumbest show.  It's ridiculous.  I just saw this fight.  I figured we'd throw it on the air today.  It's a VH1 reality show, so you know what you're getting.  How's it end?  Good for them.  How's it end?  It's just about done.  Good for them.  They got a little heat.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[01:25:00]  I'm happy.  Joe Francis, he's a nobody.  Let him go and exploit more girls for money.  Wow.  Got him.  Joe walks away.  And that's a...  Wow.  He's a...  Flavor Flav rules.  You smell like shit.  You don't shower.  I shower!  I do!  Sometimes I shower.  I take a shower.  Jesus.  They should just put a GoPro on Flavor Flav's fucking forehead.  Yeah.  And just have a live stream.  That is a good one.  That guy, there's drama wherever he goes, I betcha.  But the one thing that's good about couples therapy is that it's not like the fun, charming 
[01:25:30]  Flavor Flav from like Surreal Life goes a goofball.  No, no, no.  It's like, you know, dreadlocked out.  Dreadlocks.  He's calling fucking people Dickface Joe.  It's crazy.  And I think he had this bra the whole time he was making believe he was single trying to  find a woman.  Oh, yeah.  So I think that's one of their issues.  Flavor Flav knows.  That's kind of one of their issues.  Like, fuck.  Flavor Flav knows how to rock these reality shows.  Yeah.  I mean, keep in mind, I believe it was Flavor Flav's reality show where  one of the contestants accidentally shit on the staircase. 
[01:26:00]  Shit on the stairs.  Right.  Let out a little nugget.  Oh, God.  You want to talk about nuggets?  That is a nugget.  That was one.  That could be the most disgusting thing to ever happen on a reality show.  Right.  If someone has a better one, I would love to hear it.  True.  But they're doing the, all the women are standing around wondering what?  Who's going to be picked for that week or something?  Who's going to fucking be picked.  And this chick is wearing no fucking panties and drops a log right on the carpet in this  really nice mansion in front of everybody.  Do you have that clip?  I can, how does an adult woman shit themselves on television? 
[01:26:30]  I don't know.  Are they a little nervous?  A nugget rolled out of her bottom?  I think that's the worst moment in reality show history.  Has to be.  Damn.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And her name was something.  Yeah, something.  Because you something, girl.  I'm serious.  There's something.  They're all.  Just when you think that.  That's delicious.  No, please come here.  Me too? 
[01:27:00]  Yes.  They're all going.  This is like horrible already and we're dealing with shit.  But this is even worse.  I'm not going to take that shit.  What?  There's like a soiled tampon.  Oh, this is different.  On the soap rack in the shower.  Oh, my God.  I didn't know that was.  That's pretty fucking disgusting, too.  How do these women live?  They're fucking animals.  They're animals.  If you're doing that, you're an animal.  Period. 
[01:27:30]  You don't have the shit clip, though?  You have to have the shit clip.  Shit on stairs, right?  Is that the one?  It was at the bottom of the stairs.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  I remember.  Because my hand was in your face.  He doesn't want you, sweetie.  Yeah, because this was the chick.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Oh, my God.  I'm so skinny.  Oh, my God.  What am I going to do?  What the fuck?  Yeah, she doesn't want to do it.  That's not that, because I hate that when people do that.  Leave the clips alone.  Where's the fucking duty clip? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, we need some shit.  Boots.  I don't think that's it.  They were all going up the stairs or something.  Yeah.  And the sad part is they're all fighting over Flavor Flav.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Oh, jeez.  All right.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Fine.  It's during the break.  We got D.L.  Hughley waiting outside.  D.L.  is out there.  What's he got going on?  Book?  Oh, yeah.  Crazy.  I thought everyone knew.  Ryan in Minnesota wants to remind us that Flavor Flav turned our big O&A event into a fucking 
[01:28:30]  record release party.  Record release party.  And we were all scared shitless and didn't do anything about it.  We did nothing.  We did absolutely nothing as he introduced 50 people from his entourage one by one live  on the radio.  And it was the unofficial public enemy reunion show.  Right.  We were just fucking overtaken.  Yeah, he bamboozled Chuck D.  We were fucking overtaken.  Because Chuck D came out to support him and all of a sudden Flavor Flav was announcing  that public enemies came back to him.  Yeah.  Great. 
[01:29:00]  He David Lee Rothed him.  He really did.  I'm not going to say it's our best work, but I love the fact that that happened.  It sounded horrendous on the radio, but I couldn't believe it was going down.  I think that's when Tom Chiasano left.  He was mad.  Yeah, he was really fucking pissed.  He was telling me to stop it.  I'm like, you stop it.  I don't know what the fuck to do.  I don't know who has a gun on stage.  And then Flavor Flav bamboozled the people he brought on stage because they all went there 
[01:29:30]  thinking it was his big record release party.  Yeah.  And then they're all looking in the audience seeing no black people going, where the fuck  are we?  That was crazy.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  This is it.  This right here.  Yeah, this is it.  Yeah.  So they're having champagne.  Flavor Flav has a crown on that he got from Oriental Frating.  The toast.  I was like, what is that smell in my crib, yo? 
[01:30:00]  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  They're all looking around for the smell.  Oh, there's a scream.  We're sitting there telling each other like, do you smell that?  What is that?  I was like, wait a minute.  I know we don't have no dogs in here.  Oh, that's a good one.  Hey, yo.  Hey, yo.  Hey, yo.  I don't know if it's worth playing. 
[01:30:30]  It's a long clip.  It's taking forever.  It is taking forever.  Wow.  A nugget can smell that bad right away?  Thanks for coming down, yo.  When she came back, she had this look on her face like, oh, that's my man.  Cheers, man.  Something just took a shit on the floor.  Have a good time, y'all.  She shit on the fucking floor.  After we do the toast, something takes off upstairs.  Oh my God. 
[01:31:00]  That's a nasty.  I smell this.  Elimination is over.  I just want a sigh of relief.  So I take this deep breath and what is that smell?  And as I'm going up the steps, I look down.  And I was like, no.  Hey, hey, hey.  Watch your step.  It was right on the stairs.  She shit on the stairs.  What is that? 
[01:31:30]  Oh my God.  Watch out.  I was like, wait a minute.  I know we don't have no dogs in here.  Yeah, you do.  I'm like, where did this come from?  Hey, yo.  Something pooped on the floor.  Something is on herself.  And everyone's like, oh my God.  Do you believe how much time they're spending on a girl shitting on the stairs?  It's crazy.  How am I supposed to get upstairs?  Oh my goodness. 
[01:32:00]  I'm sorry.  We ought to clean that up.  Yeah, no kidding.  Hey, yo, son.  Hey, yo, son.  Now we're just watching.  Something jumped out.  Oh my God.  That smell was something.  Damn.  All right.  All right.  Enough.  But that's the worst reality show moment, I think.  That's pretty disgusting.  Dropped a fucking nugget on the staircase.  Yeah.  All right.  Are we going to break?  I guess so.  D.L. Hughley is next.  Stay right where you are. 
[01:32:30]  You're absolutely right.  D.L. Hughley in studio.  We're talking about New York City kids, radio shows, flavorful.  The Flav.  We're all over the place.  But yeah, you make a good point.  This city of ours, it takes one car to fuck up everything. 
[01:33:00]  The police stopping somebody.  Right.  One lousy car and now your commute sucks.  Everything sucks.  Right.  Get one thing.  That's why, man, Anthony Weiner is the perfect candidate.  Is he?  He's the fucking perfect candidate.  Because New York is a city that works, but it's a little grimy.  Right.  He's everything New York.  We love that he's not dropping out of the race.  No, yeah.  We love it.  Isn't it just like a dick not to know when to pull out? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Isn't it just like a dick?  I love it.  You know, Mark Sanford was the governor of South Carolina, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  Sucks around on his wife, leaves the state, takes misappropriate funds.  He gets elected for Congress.  Beats out, what, Colbert's sister.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  David Vintner, a senator, you know, from Louisiana, hires prostitutes, which is illegal.  This dude shows pictures of his dick in this controversy. 
[01:34:00]  That's what I'm like.  Yeah.  And I'm glad we have technology, because we used to have to draw pictures of our dick,  and that was a way for somebody to finish with the copy machine.  Yeah, yeah, that or Polaroids.  Yeah, that would be it.  You had your Polaroids.  And the copy machine, you would get a primitive fucking picture of your dick.  Sitting down on the copy machine.  Right.  Because, wait, are you finished with that copy machine yet?  That was a thing for a while.  The copy machine was the source for a lot of inter-office hijinks. 
[01:34:30]  Do you remember when we were working in Boston, the girls would fax us their boobs,  and we thought it was the hottest thing ever, even though it looked...  Yeah.  It just looks ridiculous.  Yeah.  It looked so stupid.  But it's so nice, though.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think it's nice when somebody shares it.  It's very nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It gives you a little smile.  It's loving.  It's loving.  It is.  The Wiener thing, though, I mean, we accepted him, and we were giving him a second chance.  He was leading the polls.  He couldn't stay away.  And he couldn't stay away. 
[01:35:00]  He couldn't stop tweeting pictures of his dick.  Right.  Maybe it's just dick pride.  Yeah, but that's one of those fucking, like, compulsion.  How is that horrible?  Oh, I don't think it's horrible, but I think the people are bothered by the fact that, you  know, he said he stopped.  They were giving him a second chance.  Oh, you mean the politicians that lie?  Right.  Oh, I think they all lie, too.  Right.  D.R., I'm with you.  I don't like any of these guys.  The lying politicians.  He's on the cover with his wife and his newborn son saying, you know, I've changed my life  around.  Yeah, but all he did, okay, he didn't actually use his dick. 
[01:35:30]  He just showed it.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And talk dirty.  Yeah.  People are saying that he shows poor judgment.  No, it's actually good judgment.  You know I have this problem.  Uh-huh.  You can't tweet a disease to yourself.  Well, that's true.  You can't tweet HPV.  That's not going to happen.  Oh, I tweeted a genital war.  I can't.  You can't do that.  Right, right, right.  I think it's the amount of time he's wasting on this little hobby of his, and you're thinking, 
[01:36:00]  wow, he's going to have no time to run the city.  Well, I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  In your car, the technology makes it easy to do anything.  Everybody's getting in trouble for the dumbest shit.  Like, what's that dude?  It is.  The receiver from, uh, right from, um, uh, what the fuck?  Riley Cooper, right?  Riley Cooper, you know, at a fucking Kenny Chesney concert.  I'll beat every nigga here.  Ain't no niggas at Kenny Chesney concert.  If he'd have said that shit at a Lil Wayne concert, that would impress me.  Right. 
[01:36:30]  Now they're talking.  You know what?  Yeah, yeah.  That's the fucking joke.  We missed it.  There's no niggas at a Kenny Chesney concert.  Ain't niggas at a Kenny Chesney concert is cleaning up.  Not as brave as saying that in a Lil Wayne show.  Right, right.  He's saying shit at a Jay-Z concert.  I'm impressed.  Nothing but respect for that guy.  He's not here anymore.  God damn it.  He went out like a man.  And it's so funny.  Like, Paula Deen, he calls her 12 men.  Who knew niggas was so expensive?  Jesus Christ.  And I don't even know why people get worked up. 
[01:37:00]  This word, this is, you know, something, like, honestly, it is hugely offensive.  And I get it.  But I refuse to let it have that level of power.  Like, I would rather, I don't even know why she got in trouble.  Like, Paula Deen's words have hurt her much less than her cookbooks.  Like, I would rather have a redneck call me niggas than a doctor tell me I need a heart transplant.  You can jog off niggas.  And if she used olive oil as much as she used niggas, she wouldn't have type 2 diabetes. 
[01:37:30]  It is odd, though, that I think her actions over the years were, you know, she was good friends with Oprah.  Everybody.  That's the one black person you can all be friends with.  That is true.  You can be friends with.  That is true.  But always back to Oprah.  Yeah.  She's on the top of the pyramid.  Right.  Everyone considers her friends.  Yeah, everybody.  They never even meet her.  But then she, you know, she was being honest.  And they asked her, you know, hey, she answered it honestly. 
[01:38:00]  And then you just, like, she paid with her career.  A southern woman from Georgia.  Yeah.  Almost 70-year-old woman from Georgia.  Yeah, 30 years ago.  Every white person I believe is a nigga.  Everyone.  I believe that too.  Everyone.  Absolutely.  It's ridiculous to believe that they answer.  They say that they haven't.  We asked Sean Hannity.  He said no.  Sean Hannity's a lying animal.  And he said, it bothers me to this day.  And we go, well, have you ever even thought the word?  He goes, oh, absolutely not.  I'm like, that's your liar.  It's such a liar.  Every single person has used the word. 
[01:38:30]  And it was built well.  That is the fucking pyramid of racial slurs.  It really is the top of the pyramid.  It'll last longer.  I mean, you don't know anything that's that old that still works.  Right.  In all fairness, it does exactly what it is.  Even 400 years.  Didn't need updating or nothing.  No, no.  It ain't no nigga 2.0.  It's this shit steel.  It's like the fucking Edsel of this shit work.  It's the original recipe.  It is.  We didn't change a thing.  You don't need the new Coke. 
[01:39:00]  No.  This ain't your father's nigga.  It's steel.  It's steel.  In Sean Hayes' defense, I got to say that, of course, you can't admit that.  No one can admit that.  He's on Fox News.  Just because this is the society we live in, they will crucify you for telling the fucking  truth.  Yeah, I'm not on Fox News.  It's like a parallel universe there.  You think they could get away with it on Fox News?  I think that it is such an echo chamber that they're so insulated.  Right.  Even if Sean hasn't said it, everybody I know believes he has.  Of course. 
[01:39:30]  He is the type of dude.  I just don't.  Here's the thing.  I don't respect people that have these, that use other words that, you know, like when  Bill O'Reilly goes on and made some valid points about Trayvon Martin and single mothers,  except that the thing that he was talking about, Trayvon Martin wasn't born to a single  mother.  He was born to a nuclear family who got divorced.  So the very argument you're making doesn't apply to the conversation you're having.  I think what he was doing was trying to just, I don't think he was talking about Trayvon  literally at that point, but it started it. 
[01:40:00]  Well, it's kind of like the conversation.  It's kind of like the same thing, though.  You could go the other way around and say a lot of conversation has been put on standing  your ground laws when the standing your ground law wasn't really an issue on this one.  No, but the jury, the jury instruction wasn't basically the same.  They were instructed as to what standing your ground was.  In the jury instructions.  Yeah.  It was like, this is what it is, but it wasn't being used as a defense in that case.  Here's the thing.  My whole argument with that thing is Trayvon Martin wasn't doing anything.  So he got killed.  And if a young black man is doing something and get killed, what's the difference? 
[01:40:30]  Like, really, what's the difference?  If you can kill a dude that wasn't doing anything, and you can kill a young black man that is doing  something, there's no discernible difference.  Apparently, everyone leaves out the part where he's punching the gentleman in the face.  Except this.  You leave out the fact that if you're a young man and a strange dude walks up to you with a gun,  you're fighting for your life.  Well, there also isn't any indication that he had his gun out when he was walked up to  him, or if he even did walk up to him.  Here's the thing.  We know that Trayvon Martin was where he was supposed to be. 
[01:41:00]  So was George Zimmerman.  Okay.  Except that Trayvon Martin didn't run up to George Zimmerman.  He didn't call him suspicious.  He wasn't following him.  Standing your ground works a couple of ways.  Not only does George Zimmerman, nobody ever took into consideration the fact that that  boy might have been fighting for his life, too.  George Zimmerman is a pussy who would have never got out of that car if he didn't have  that gun.  And you know it.  He never got out of that car if he didn't have that gun.  He'd have stayed in that car. 
[01:41:30]  But another one of the big points was if Trayvon was so scared, as they had pointed out, why  didn't he just go fucking home?  Okay, let me ask you something.  Why didn't George Zimmerman give his address out?  Because he didn't want the kid that he was scared of to know where he lived.  Why wouldn't Trayvon Martin have the same fear to go, I don't want this guy to know  where I live.  This strange, creepy guy.  Why does that logic apply to George Zimmerman, but not to Trayvon?  But he wasn't even close enough to Trayvon at that point.  Trayvon had plenty of time to go home when he was out of the sight of George Zimmerman. 
[01:42:00]  Why did George Zimmerman not say what his address was?  Because he didn't want Trayvon.  He said, I don't know who this guy is.  I don't want.  Right.  So he didn't want him to know where he lived.  Yeah.  So why didn't Trayvon have that same right to not want Zimmerman to know where he lived?  If you were afraid, wouldn't you want to maybe go home to where you're...  Not if my kids are there.  Not if I don't want to bring trouble to my home.  If somebody was chasing me, I knew they were going to hurt my family.  Well, they weren't chasing him.  He wasn't chasing him.  He was watching him. 
[01:42:30]  I'll give him that.  Oh, my God.  It's on the 911 call.  It's on the 911 call.  He says...  The 911 operator, who, by the way, was even not an emergency, whatever.  But he says to him, he goes, all right, let me know what he does.  He said that.  He goes, let me know what he does.  And George goes, okay.  And wouldn't that lead you to believe he wants you to keep an eye on him at least?  There's an area...  He said, I was looking for addresses.  And he pointed out there was an address right there.  On the door. 
[01:43:00]  It was nighttime.  Remember that?  Yeah, it was...  It was nighttime.  No one I've ever met gets out of the car when they believe somebody's a threat.  When you...  The only people who do that is that they believe...  I don't believe he thought Trayvon was a threat at that point.  He wanted...  He said...  He called the cops on him.  He called the cops.  This guy's up to something.  They always get away.  Right, right, right.  So that's...  So he called the cops.  It's not a threat.  It's somebody in the neighborhood that he assumes might be...  Why?  Why did he assume that?  Because he fit the exact bill of everyone else that was robbing the place. 
[01:43:30]  So a black kid?  Yeah.  A black kid wearing the uniform of the people that were robbing the fucking houses.  How is that not racially motivated?  It's racially motivated in that it fit the bill of everyone that was robbing the place.  He was wrong.  That time?  Perhaps.  No, the...  Wait.  He was wrong.  He wasn't robbing somebody.  Do you profile?  Do you profile young black men?  And you know what happens?  I've never killed one of them.  All right.  I've never gone. 
[01:44:00]  I'm so scared of you that things got so out of hand that somebody dies because...  Because I guess you've never been beaten in the face by one.  I have been beat...  I lived in the 135th and Avalon.  All right.  I got beaten by Mo...  I tell you what, I'm taking a few ass whoop it by Nikki.  So I know what it's like.  But I...  And really have.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not just in one isolated incident.  So you...  An ass whooping, I don't care who you are, is not a kin.  So you can't take an ass whooping anymore?  You know what?  For the most part, a lot of people do take ass whoopings. 
[01:44:30]  A lot of guys...  A lot of white people without guns take ass whoopings from black guys.  Right.  I'll be honest with you.  And a lot of them don't get beat to death.  A few do.  Okay.  A lot of them don't.  A lot of them don't.  So George Zimmerman was getting an ass whooping...  And unfortunately for Trayvon, he picked the wrong guy to punch.  No, no, no, no.  It is the thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is the thing.  No matter what I say, what has happened in society is two things people never feel sorry for.  A great white shark and a young black male. 
[01:45:00]  Never.  They never go...  Because they never give a young black male the big life.  They never go, oh, this shark wasn't doing anything.  You know, it's...  Because you believe that you would...  Most white people go, I have to see how I would be afraid if I were in the dark with a young black male.  Yeah, yeah.  What that means is that because somebody may fit a particular profile, that because they  look a certain way, that you can all of a sudden kill them.  And he really, he really, no one knows what happened. 
[01:45:30]  I don't know what happened.  You don't know what happened.  But what very rarely happens is an all-white jury gives a black man the benefit of the doubt.  Never happens.  And that's not even anecdotal.  That's just very rarely is anybody convicted for doing anything to a young man.  We don't know everything that happened.  We know somebody's dead, they didn't have a gun.  But we have a good idea.  There are pieces missing.  If you take a fucking puzzle, and you know it's a puzzle of a fucking three kittens, and  there's some pieces missing.  Three kittens.  You could say, that puzzle, even though there's pieces missing, I know there are three kittens 
[01:46:00]  in this puzzle.  Even though there's pieces missing, I could tell you it's not a globe.  It's not a puzzle of a fucking, you know, a prairie.  It's that, even though there's pieces missing.  That's what we saw here.  We get George Zimmerman beat about the face.  We get Trayvon, the only mark on him was the bullet wound.  And a few little scrapes on it.  In the grand scheme of things, would you rather take the ass whooping a bullet?  I'd rather take an ass whooping than a bullet.  The problem, this thing has perpetuated itself all over the country. 
[01:46:30]  I don't care what, when you get an all-white jury, it's very, this is not just me.  It's not even anecdotal.  It's very rare that a right jury convicts anybody for doing anything to a black guy.  Anybody.  They always find a way to kind of, I remember Rodney King, they were going, well, look at it.  They showed the video of his hand flinching while he was getting there.  He's fighting back.  No, he's getting his ass whipped.  We have a way of rounding things to our perception based on our beliefs. 
[01:47:00]  That's just the truth.  My experience, because I have a young black son who fits a profile.  Absolutely.  And to me, it's just, it seems like it's no one, it's open season on it.  Isn't it within the realm of possibility that regardless of the jury's race, that the evidence showed that he was acting in defense of his belief that he was going to either die or suffer grave physical?  I believe that any time, any time of all, anything, anything, all women, all men, all blacks, you got the judgment that you got from the OJ child because there was no dissenting voice. 
[01:47:30]  It was all one particular group, which wasn't indicative of the population.  It was just one group.  You got all white women, not indicative of that population.  Did you see that one?  There was one black woman who was Hispanic, but she, I saw her.  She looked pretty black to me.  You're right.  Wear her hair.  We'll see what happens. 
[01:48:00]  And the prosecution tossed another black woman that would have been a jury because she was a watcher of Fox News.  In a county that's 32% black.  32%.  My argument, they shouldn't be all one anything.  It should be, when you have a situation where there's no dissenting voice, where there's nobody to explain this particular aspect of it,  where there's nobody to say, bring another, you get decisions like this. 
[01:48:30]  But the evidence, the evidence, that was there.  The evidence didn't do that to me.  The evidence, well, you know what?  I think you're bringing racial emotion into it more so than, oh, that's not, why is it that you?  I believe an all-white jury can be more impartial in this case than an all-black jury would have been.  It's never happened.  I absolutely believe they can be more impartial.  But it's not even anecdotal.  It's never happened.  Because the racial emotion I've seen come out in this case with black people has been stunning.  Why do you think it is?  Why?  Why?  Because there's a perception that black people are being prosecuted with some level of racism going on in this country. 
[01:49:00]  That's not what it is for me.  Instead of the fact that there's a lot of fucking crime going on in the black community.  Well, okay, you can't, those things don't have, you're bringing in information that doesn't have anything to do with this particular case.  For me, it is that my son is looked at as a threat.  And because somebody feels he's a threat, they can take my son away from me.  And the very justice system that's designed to protect us all doesn't do the same for me. 
[01:49:30]  That's why.  Because that boy, that boy, I have a son that looks like that.  That's not an anecdote.  That's real.  No, no, I believe you.  So my son could die and be killed, a good kid, go to school, and somebody could say, well, because he looked like somebody else, I could see how you're afraid.  If white people never tend to go, I'll put myself literally in that situation.  I'm not saying crime doesn't exist.  It does.  And I'm not saying it's not a huge problem in my community.  What I am saying is that this thing is less about, you know how many of those people who are angry about this have sons who they have to worry about?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:50:00]  So it's not just me being racially, here's the difference between that.  Like, you could be from the Midwest.  It could be a white cat from the South.  And your experiences could be totally different.  You could have no similarities that are not diet, not intellect, not interest.  Every black guy in this country has had one experience, which is like, which everybody's been racially profiled at some time.  Everybody.  Everybody.  The president of the United States said, I got followed, except in the Congress where he can't get no white people to follow.  So, to me, it's not about, it's about how do I make, it's almost like people don't believe that we could love our children and hate the idea of losing my child like anybody else does. 
[01:50:30]  Absolutely, but can't you see the point that there is not just crazy-ass white people to blame on this?  Yeah, but it was.  No, because the black community is not doing enough to police its own... 
[01:51:00]  What did that have to do with Trayvon Martin?  The reason that George Zimmerman even looked at him suspiciously in the first place is he fit the profile of a person that was robbing the neighborhood.  He had called the cops plenty of times on other young black men, because that's every report of the robberies.  No, no, not that.  No, it's true.  If you go, he fit the profile, even though he wasn't, he fit the profile, so this dude died because of... 
[01:51:30]  ...enough to call the cops and watch where he was going.  The second he started getting his face beat in...  Wait, he wouldn't have got his face beat in if he stayed his fat ass in the car!  If he stayed in the car...  How do you take an ass woman when you stay in the car?  Since when is it illegal to get out of the car?  And since when is it illegal not to go...  It's not illegal.  Why do you make allowances?  Well, you make one allowance.  We've said, you said George Zimmerman didn't want whoever it was he was for, or whoever was in the vicinity, to know where he lives, so he wouldn't give his address.  Right.  But you don't give that same allowance to Trayvon Martin. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, I...  You don't.  You don't go, why would a man not even want to talk about his address so he wouldn't say it out loud?  But why would he didn't go home?  Because he didn't...  Why didn't...  Why weren't they capable of the same fear?  How did Trayvon Martin...  He didn't jump in the car with George Zimmerman.  Mm-hmm.  How is it that you cannot see my...  I've actually had to see white people's points on a number of things.  I've actually been forced to. 
[01:52:30]  You guys win a lot.  Oh, Christ.  I've actually been forced to.  I've actually been forced, like, where there's bail here, where a cop shoots him innocent and they go, well, even though he wasn't doing anything, how many times do you get to say, because you, some cats shoot up shit in Chicago or rob a place in Miami, we get to do whatever we want because there's fear there.  That's not a legal precedent.  It's not a legal argument. 
[01:53:00]  It is immoral to actually be that way.  No, you're absolutely right, but I'll use the example I've used before.  If you're walking up to an ATM and you see a black guy in a hoodie standing next to the ATM...  I don't kill him.  You're...  No, you don't kill him.  I'm not going from zero to 180 here.  Let's go in the middle, in a gray area, which is you are a lot more leery of taking your money out in front of that guy than you would be even a black guy in an Armani suit standing next to him.  You wouldn't be as paranoid as you would the young black guy in a hoodie. 
[01:53:30]  I'm not even bringing a white guy into this.  So when George Zimmerman sees a young black male in a hoodie walking in his neighborhood and that fit the bill, at least he called the cops and then kept an eye on him so that...  And he said, oh, these fuckers, they always get away.  So this time he's like, I'm going to keep an eye on him so when the cops show up I can go, there he is.  There's not this either stay in the truck or shoot him.  There actually is.  No, there wasn't.  There actually is.  When he got out of that vehicle, you honestly think he was hunting down Trayvon to shoot and kill him. 
[01:54:00]  Do I actually believe that with all my heart?  Yes.  Stop it.  No.  There's no way.  I can look you dead in your eye with no equivocation.  I don't believe you believe that.  And here's the thing.  I have no doubt, I have no doubt that cats like that who want to be cops, who take MMA so they can be tough, have...  I don't think that this guy went out and went, I'm going to kill a guy. 
[01:54:30]  I know, I believe he went, I'm going to be a hero today.  I'm going to be a hero today.  And I'm going to drive the pagans from the village.  I'm going to make my mark.  And it's a couple of things.  I don't think he does that if it's a grown man.  I think he's a...  George Zimmerman is a beta male.  First of all, can we agree?  He's a beta male.  He's the kind of dude...  We agree that he's a beta male.  And beta males are often the kind of dudes who go, I'm going to show people how tough I am by picking a fight I believe I can win. 
[01:55:00]  Can we stop the not a grown man thing or the child thing or anything?  That's been bullshitted up the ass on the news.  At 17 years old, you go to a pediatrician.  That makes you a child.  Oh, believe me, I know.  At 17 years old, you go to a...  I had to take a girl from there.  You can't vote.  You can't vote.  So let's not...  But let's not portray him as that 12-year-old picture that we saw.  He was a 17-year-old child.  Stop with the child.  He was a child. 
[01:55:30]  Semantics.  But any...  It's not semantical.  It's illegal.  It's the...  You know what?  I could pop up pictures of 17, 18-year-olds or 16, 17-year-olds that have pounded people's heads in and killed them.  And they're tried as adults for the violence of their tribe.  And they would still be 17.  But they're being tried as adults.  But they still would be 17.  You make an...  The thing is that you can't, for the purposes of an argument, make a truth an untruth.  But you can't think...  He is 17.  But I see people... 
[01:56:00]  He was a child.  But I see people...  He's a pediatrician.  Child is...  That word being used in reference to Trayvon Martin in this case...  Why?  Because black people can't be child?  Child is so...  No, they can't actually.  They can't be children?  They're born adults.  I know.  I mean...  No, I'm just saying that using the word child was so divisive.  It was...  Because it's what he was.  You know what?  So now we have to make a special definition for a guy that you deem predatory.  No, the media portrayed him as a 12-year-old. 
[01:56:30]  No.  We never saw those pictures flashed on the news for months, maybe even a full year, of  anything that resembled how old he was in actuality.  He was 17 years old.  Can he vote?  No.  Can he buy liquor?  No.  Any decision he makes, if he does something wrong, his parents are still, in some places,  responsible for it.  He could be tried as an adult.  But he didn't do anything worth being tried as an adult for.  If George Zimmerman didn't kill him, he probably would have gotten assault charges put on him. 
[01:57:00]  And he may have.  And he may have.  My argument is this.  I've been him.  I know what it's like to be a cat that smokes weed, to be lost, to get in trouble.  I've been him.  And when, just like when people tried to make Trayvon Martin, he's not 17-year-old, when  they tried to go, oh, he's a dropout who smokes weed, and that's why, you make arguments  that you don't give equal weight to the other side.  And I've had to, listen, you won the debate, you won the debate, obviously, the jury saw 
[01:57:30]  it your way.  I will say this.  It's not uncommon for white juries in all parts of this country to come to those conclusions  when there's a black victim in court.  It's not.  It's just not.  That's not anecdotal.  It very rarely happens.  Up in the 90 percentiles where a white, that's not an accident.  That's not an accident.  That is a perception.  People see it a certain way.  They are very rarely willing to give a black kid or a black young man the benefit of the  doubt.  Do you see any blame whatsoever in the black community for the disproportionate amount 
[01:58:00]  of crime, being why white people go, oh, fuck, look at that.  That's like every banker I go to, I get to say that he's made of.  I get to, I get that, but I don't get to do that.  You probably would be right.  I don't get to do that.  No, you can assume that until you learn different.  I mean, again, again.  I've never learned different.  If you profile somebody at the ATM, you're doing that for your own protection and on  safety, but you could do that and then find out that he's perfectly fine and be cool with 
[01:58:30]  it.  But you know what's funny?  It's another.  Look at the Department of Justice and see who are the majority of people arrested in  this country.  Seventy-five percent of them are white.  Seventy-five percent of them.  And you know what happens in the justice system?  Because judges, prosecutors, DAs, police officers are white, and they see a white kid, they  go, oh, he reminds me of my nephew or myself when I was a kid, and I, you know, I'll give  him deferment. 
[01:59:00]  I'll deal with him differently.  When you see a black kid who you have no relation to, he has to be dealt with more harshly.  You think there's that unbelievable amount of institutional racism going on in this country?  A cat in Philadelphia, a judge, a couple of months ago, was sending young black men to  the private prison industry, selling them there.  Yes.  And he was a judge.  Yes, I do believe that.  I believe that.  I've seen cases where there's been black judges that have been so lenient on young black criminals  that that is when they do finally commit an amazing crime, you see there's a... 
[01:59:30]  That's the exception, not the rule.  Whenever you, no, whenever you see a young black male that has committed a huge murder,  right, whatever it is, there's this laundry list of priors that they have just been run  through and lent back out.  And you know who we give them to?  Other white, other black people.  Oh, absolutely.  That's, to me, another example of racism, where they kind of go, you can do whatever you  want to you, but the minute it crosses over and I got to deal with it, it's different. 
[02:00:00]  Well, I see it the same way that there's a problem, but I see a problem in the black  community as not recognizing the black-on-black violence and the perpetrator being more important  than the victim.  Did you ever see, I did a documentary called Endangered.  I want to pee by their word, but I don't want to get that.  All right.  Stop it.  I don't want to do that.  Yo, you glad.  We talked about, you have no argument for me there, but what you say is, well, because  of black, black people still don't want young black men killing young black men. 
[02:00:30]  Of course.  I, that to me, that is an argument that, and it isn't race that's the biggest determining  factor, it's poverty.  Any, statistically, it's not race, it's poverty.  So, if you want to do something about violence and crime, there has to be something, at some  level, you have to address what the core root of it is.  There's ten times the poverty in the white community than there is in the black community. 
[02:01:00]  That's a faith, that's an exact argument, because there's ten times the opportunity.  The number of people.  But, you know how hard it is to be homeless and white?  You have to be, you know how big a failure you got to be to be homeless and white?  You have to, if you are white and homeless, then you, this, you, you, you, you, you, you,  you, you, how fucking, how could you be homeless and white? 
[02:01:30]  You know how hard it is to fail with white?  Is that, is that because there's, there's, that's because there's always another white  guy willing to give another white guy a break.  A family structure, perhaps, that, that broke down so terribly with the white guy that he's  now homeless and you go, what happened to your fucking family?  What happened to this?  What happened to that?  And then, you know, you know what that's called?  What?  Compassion.  Yeah.  For a kinship.  You go, I recognize something that I see in myself and him and I'm going to be compassionate.  Right. 
[02:02:00]  That's called compassion.  And it's the very argument I'm having right now.  The two things people never have compassion for are great white sharks and young black  men.  The very thing, you would never go, wow, he lost his family.  And the same argument you made, but you would never make that argument for someone.  You don't think that young black men.  And you know, and the truth is, you know, I'm getting to you.  You know, I'm right.  No, no, I always listen to, and you're making unbelievably valid points.  I understand.  Absolutely.  But you don't think that young black men have great opportunities in this country, even if 
[02:02:30]  they're born into poverty.  Do you believe that?  I absolutely believe there is great.  Because that is an uninformed.  That is an uninformed.  No, it's not.  If you get a well-educated young black man and put him up against a well-educated young  white man for a job, the black kid's going to get it.  It's just, I honestly believe that.  But I need to see more effort in the black community to get young black men to educate. 
[02:03:00]  What does that look like to you?  Because you said effort, and there's no black community.  It's fragmented, just like there's no Jewish community.  There's no, I don't know why.  People believe that just because Martin Luther King said 70 years ago.  There's such separatism.  It's amazing how divided we are as a nation based on color.  Yeah, because we started out that way.  But let me make a point.  You said that we all have the same education. 
[02:03:30]  So you know that's not true, right?  You do know that.  I'll give you examples from my life.  I won't give you.  I went to, I donated.  You can look it up.  I'm not, I donated to a school called Avalon Gardens 20 years ago, about 16 years ago.  A library.  I bought a library.  In that book 15 years ago, you know, they had books in the library that said one day a man will walk on the moon.  In the library.  In the library.  When my children moved from the inner city in Los Angeles to the valley in California, they were so far behind from one, and it was the same school district. 
[02:04:00]  They were so far behind from Los Angeles to West Hills, California.  I had to hire them tutors that they kept to the day they got out of school.  Now, if I don't have those resources to do that, they start out at a deficit that they never catch up to.  And that's replicated all over the country.  Well, then, where do these inspirational stories come from of these young black children that persevere, transcend the poverty? 
[02:04:30]  They're called the exception and not the rule.  So you can't take an example.  Like, I'm the one black guy who can't dance.  You saw me on Dancing with the Stars.  Anomaly.  I got the lowest scores in the history of this year.  It's fun to watch, though.  That's called an anomaly.  That's not that.  Black people call me, what the fuck is wrong with you?  So how do we fix the schooling idea?  I think that you have to decide.  I actually do agree with you on that. 
[02:05:00]  You have to decide if it's important.  Well, the country has decided it's not important.  We do not like that.  And I'm going to make you these allowances.  The education age for the black male is akin to the ice age for the dinosaur.  It really is.  It's that stark.  If you're not educated enough, to take an example, you'll take advantage of the jobs.  Because if you major in science and math, mathematics, chances are you'll do well. 
[02:05:30]  Chances are you'll do better.  That, we have to make educated.  And some, like West Indian, African, usually when people win academic scholarships or academic decathlons,  it's generally an Asian or a West Indian.  Right, right.  That's just true.  Yeah, yeah.  So, obviously, there has to be a higher premium and value system placed on education.  And, obviously, it does start.  I think that the breakdown in the family is just universally, you can attribute a lot of problems to that. 
[02:06:00]  And I think that transcends white or black.  I think it's one of the biggest issues is parenting and the family unit.  But that's still, to me, what it takes is people to see past what they know themselves, what they see themselves.  I've had to see things your way.  I've had to.  And I would say a lot of people have had to, a lot of people of others have had to see things your way.  Right.  I don't, I, I, I, it's, it's a disingenuous argument and not true to say that you had to do the same. 
[02:06:30]  Not in that way, no.  No, no, no, no.  In what other way would it be that matters?  No, no, no, I'm just saying we, we, we all have grown up with our crosses to bear.  I'd rather have yours.  Life.  Life.  Well, our burning crosses to bear.  This fire is hot, Jesus Christ.  But I, I, I, I just don't like, like, I'm not, I like, you are.  No, I like discussions like this.  We're all, some totals of our life's experience. 
[02:07:00]  All you are, what you see.  Absolutely.  And my experiences have been different.  I would say I'm the quintessential American dream.  I am.  Absolutely.  And I found a way to make it.  I am the anomaly.  I'm the exception, not the rule.  How is it that we make more exceptions?  How do we make more anomalies?  We've all, we've all had to transcend something.  We've all had to get, not every white guy is born into this.  That's not true.  All white people are rich.  All white people are rich.  You know, I, I. 
[02:07:30]  You know, it's people, you, you know, I'm actually being facetious.  Absolutely.  I, I think, yeah.  But, but there are, there are plenty of instances where, you know, I grew up in, in a home where  my mom raised three kids.  My dad fucking took off, went to California.  What's his name?  So, uh, Joey, Joey.  That might be my father.  How did we find out we were a brother?  Did they?  There is a similarity with it.  There's a fucking movie there.  The shade's a little different, but there is a similarity.  He was born in the winter.  I'm Sicilian.  I go into the winter.  Give me the sun for a week. 
[02:08:00]  Listen, listen, I, DL has to go.  Yeah.  He's doing TV.  You're already five minutes late.  Oh, man.  I am, man.  You know what?  Even though, I don't see things the way you do it.  Even though you're a racist motherfucker.  I don't think you're racist.  I'm kidding.  I don't at all.  I think that, I think you're, you're, you're a product of your mind.  I, no, I don't.  Well, that makes me almost sound retarded.  No, it doesn't.  I think.  I'm a product of mine, man.  I think that finally to be able to actually speak like this is a good thing.  Me too.  Because people have just clammed up over the years and, and are petrified of either being 
[02:08:30]  called a racist or a fucking militant or whatever the fuck you want to call it.  But I think an open dialogue is so important right now.  And I, I think the fear of being, uh, put in, in trouble or losing your job.  How the fuck does a grown man get in trouble?  It's amazing to me, but they do.  It's astounding to me.  Whenever somebody says anything, I defend people's right.  And you, you know me to say whatever they want to say.  Right.  Yeah.  Because I believe that what happens is we don't have dialogue because you're right. 
[02:09:00]  People go, I'll get in trouble.  I don't want to lose what I have.  So I'll pretend to feel a way I don't.  And then when something happens, they go, it's, it's like a, it's like a, we, we keep pretending  to be something.  Yes.  And then we find out we're not, we're shocked.  We're shocked.  Yeah.  I can't believe this still happens here because you've never, we, uh, rather than have a conversation,  now they're trying to tell people what to think.  Right.  You, it's wrong for you to think that way.  Mm-hmm.  And that's just, that, that, that causes frustration and anger and nothing ever gets solved. 
[02:09:30]  It's like, to me, like when Jason Collins came out and said that he was gay, I was proud  of the country for not, you know, it made me proud that we've evolved that far.  And I'm also proud that he played for the Washington Wizards and not the Packers, the  Browns, or the Rams.  That would have, that would have been, that would have been a lot to take.  Because in the end, we're really immature.  In the end, we wouldn't have been able to hold back on that. 
[02:10:00]  He's a Packer.  Got it.  I haven't been, I've been off since Michael Douglas said that eating pussy can cause  throat cancer.  Yeah.  I have.  Black guys are not supposed to, but I enjoy it.  You're looking at the pussy a little differently.  You're like, oh, oh, oh, boy.  Every morning I get a free cola.  I don't know if eating pussy causes cancer, but I know not eating pussy causes divorce.  You could have a lump in your throat or a lump sum missing from your bank account, but 
[02:10:30]  you're going to make a choice.  DL, we've got to get you out of here.  What are you promoting?  I know you're at Gotham Comedy Club.  I'm at Gotham.  Tonight and tomorrow, right?  Holy fuck.  Go see DL if you're in the New York area.  Man, me and you are going to fix the world.  I think we could.  Your fucking redneck buddies.  All right.  With that, we've got to say it.  Thank you to DL Hughley.  Come back and see us, brother.  You'll be there at this show on Sirius X. 
[02:11:00]  Sirius XM, the Opinetry Show.  See, I'm fine.  Oh, that's hilarious.  DL Hughley gave us another great appearance.  That was fucking fun, man.  Man, he handed you your ass. 
[02:11:30]  What?  Jesus.  What happened?  I thought it was a very good.  Oh, my God.  He kicked your ass.  It was a debate.  Wow.  It was a debacle is what it was.  We both got to speak.  Speaking of standing your ground, someone in the studio didn't stand their ground too well.  And listened to each other.  Someone had wobbly legs.  There wasn't this yelling back and forth.  I know his life was in danger there.  Holy shit.  Boy, man.  Wow.  You're pussed out, man.  I thought it went swimmingly.  We could all agree, though, if Trayvon Martin was a kitten, you know, it would have been just a... 
[02:12:00]  You know what?  I'd have been so upset because, you know, I love kittens.  I'm so thinking of getting one.  I kind of saw that tweet last time.  I'm like, I think he's really thinking about it.  I'm softening up.  But then I think about my couch and my rugs in the house and everything.  And I'm like, all I can picture is I'm going, shredding everything.  Get him declawed and send him out in the backyard with the raccoons.  No.  Yeah, I got some marks on my arm, but it's worth it.  Yep.  I don't care about my arm.  I just don't want him fucking up my shit. 
[02:12:30]  The listeners already fuck up your shit.  You throw a party every other week and I bet you have to...  Bobo threw up on my floor.  I bet you got to replace half the house every time they leave.  Bobo coughed up a hairball on my floor.  No.  I want to say it on the air, though.  D.L. Hughley comes in and we're saying hi before his appearance out in the hallway.  Hank comes out, says hi.  And then he takes off for the bathroom.  And then we start the D.L. Hughley interview and you got a different shirt on.  So I asked Anthony if he was getting rid of a racist shirt or something. 
[02:13:00]  A racist shirt?  I'm like, no.  Why did you change shirts before the D.L. Hughley?  Well, I stayed in the city last night.  Right.  And I was wearing this last night.  And I thought it was fresh enough to put on this morning and come in.  So I did.  Right.  And it's been a little warm in the studio today.  And I noticed before D.L. came in, I was like...  I wasn't feeling as fresh as I liked being.  Smelly a little ripe.  I was a little bit, yeah.  So I went into the bathroom. 
[02:13:30]  First I went in the back.  And I was like, you got any serious XM shirts or anything back here?  And Travis shows me a pile of Sam and Dave special delivery shirts.  So all he had were these.  Clicker's item.  So I put on a Sam and Dave special delivery shirt.  It's a dope shirt.  It is a dope shirt.  You're absolutely right.  I went into the bathroom first and grabbed some paper towels and a little water and soap.  And did a little fucking toilet stall shower.  Oh, you did a Puerto Rican shower.  Yeah.  Mars. 
[02:14:00]  Ah.  And then I put the shirt on.  He knows what I'm talking about.  He's been there.  He's been there.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  So I just wasn't feeling good.  And then I wanted a little deodorant.  And I was going to send the interns out for some.  But Sal reminded me that he had a little.  So I've absconded his old spice.  You're using his deodorant.  Well, I wiped it off.  And then I used it.  Oh, yeah.  I would do that, too.  No problem.  It's no biggie.  Let's say hi to Nick DiPaolo, who was supposed...  Nicky.  Nick.  Nick.  Now, let me ask you a question. 
[02:14:30]  When you say the T-shirts are dope, is that good?  No, but it's accurate if you look at the names on it.  What happened to you yesterday?  I think we were going to have a little chat yesterday.  I don't fucking know.  You know, I mean, usually when you do these gigs, it's right in the original offer.  It'll list the fucking press.  But something got mixed up.  Probably on my end.  But, hey, I'm just glad to be talking to you today.  Now I have 19 hours before showtime. 
[02:15:00]  That's it, huh?  Another T-shirt has come in for you.  Who gave you that?  Oh, it's a Cal...  Cousin Brucie's first annual Palisades Park reunion.  Tell Denny to fuck off.  I got the promo going right now.  Oh, my God.  That's a horrible shirt.  That is a terrible shirt.  Oh, my God.  You know, it's terrible, too.  It's light blue, and I'm sweating through this one.  Guys don't look good in powdered blue shirts.  Get rid of that thing.  Trash can right there.  Tell Denny to jump out the fucking window.  But, I mean, thank you so much, Jackie. 
[02:15:30]  Sorry.  Thank you very much.  You've got to filter that shit sometimes.  It wasn't your fault at all.  No.  Thank you, Jackie.  Wonderful.  You're a love.  I have some old O&A shirts in the back.  He's got a shirt.  How about we talk to Nick DiPolo?  Give me an O&A shirt.  Enough about the fucking T-shirts.  Like old school shirts.  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  You're going to go old school.  Is it black?  Oh, I think there might be a black one.  There's green.  There's red.  Get me a black shirt.  You're okay with black as long as it's a T-shirt, I guess.  Well, yeah.  Most of the time.  I don't even know where you're going to be at, to be completely honest with you. 
[02:16:00]  I'm going to be at Helium in Philly tonight, two shows.  Tomorrow night, two shows.  Nice room.  Oh, fuck.  Really?  Yeah, it's one of the better rooms in the country.  I actually enjoy doing it.  I'll be selling powder blue T-shirts after this.  Oh.  I can't wait.  Yeah, Helium does a good job down there in Philly.  And I've seen Nick live, and it's fucking great.  I sit there like rah-rah-ing.  I'm like, yeah!  Yeah, he gets me all worked up.  It's like a rally.  Yes, it is like a rally. 
[02:16:30]  It's a rally with laughs.  I love it.  Get that out of here, a Bruce Springsteen shirt.  Yeah, the aunt doesn't want a Bruce Springsteen shirt.  Oh, now I got your plug sheet.  Sorry, Nick, because you shouldn't be plugging your own gig.  Yeah, Helium tonight and tomorrow, and then the Comedy Cellar.  We're promoting the Comedy Cellar.  I'm doing the underground room.  You know how they have the new room, the Comedy Cellar, the bigger room around the corner?  Yeah.  The underground.  I'm confused by it.  Every Wednesday night in August, I'm going to be doing that.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  So that is a big deal. 
[02:17:00]  I'm confused.  Are they going to shut down the original Comedy Cellar?  No.  So they got a bigger room to get more people in the seats, but they're going to keep the  original room as well?  Yeah.  Okay.  It's just like the original Comedy Cellar, only it's like more seats.  It's almost like theater.  It's a really cool room.  Oh, wow.  Theater seating.  But yeah, Helium tonight and tomorrow night, which is a great city, Philly, you know?  I like Philly a lot, obviously.  I go down there quite often. 
[02:17:30]  What are you doing today?  Anything fun?  Yeah, I have to walk to the club in about an hour and be interviewed by some kid for  a newspaper.  Oh, okay.  But are you?  And then I'll argue with some people on the street and, if you know what I'm saying, and  then I'll go back to my room.  Oh, so you're...  The fucking maid, they're having a door slamming contest right now.  They're the worst.  I'm from Brad from Ecuador.  I've never seen a hinge before.  Hotels just suck. 
[02:18:00]  They have to call you as soon as you get to your room, right when you start your nap.  They wake you up that way.  And even though you got something on the door, they still have to knock to make sure you're  meant to put the fucking thing on the doorknob.  Just leave you alone.  Just leave me the fuck alone.  Give me the leave me the fuck alone option.  Yeah, the fucking hallway chatter.  You know, they're fucking yelling at each other.  Yeah.  It's like a fight in a woman's shelter.  Yeah.  Fucking...  Sounds like a cartel outside.  Nicker, are you one of those guys when you hit a city, you kind of wander around, or are 
[02:18:30]  you just hotel to club guy?  I'm usually a hotel to club guy.  Yeah.  There's not much else to see in Cleveland, you know.  Oh my God, right.  The Hall of Fame and the fucking Spam Hall of Fame.  Right.  But Philly, I like Philly.  Philly's a great city to walk around in, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Philly is.  It's a nice fucking, like a mini central park, and you can watch people be accosted.  And, no, it's a nice city.  I like Philly. 
[02:19:00]  It's got a little edge to it, and there's museums that I've never been in, and libraries.  But you know they're there.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  A lot of hot rods walking around the city.  Yeah.  I came down here in like the late 80s, early 90s, and I was a little like hairy Italian  chicks, but now...  Well, they're still hairy Italian chicks.  They just bleached their hair.  Is that it?  Yeah, that's the new thing.  They're all just bleaching their hair blonde down there.  I have a whole chunk of asshole bleaching, actually. 
[02:19:30]  I really do.  This new hour is really dirty and put together.  I don't know...  Oh, really?  I remember you talking about it.  You decided to do something a little different.  It's a little bit...  Yeah.  It's very apolitical, but kind of dark.  And I think my buddy Jimmy would fucking enjoy it, actually.  I got to see Nick.  Oh, yeah.  It's been a while.  Great.  It has been a while.  What have you guys been talking about this morning?  Well, D.L.  Hughley came in, so there was the big Ant versus D.L. Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman thing, 
[02:20:00]  which was wonderful to listen to, actually.  That went swimmingly.  It was great.  It was good.  It was actually good.  A bit heated.  Fun to listen to.  It gets a little heated.  Yeah, yeah.  And then we're talking about Anthony Weiner.  Believe it or not, we had different viewpoints of that trial.  I like D.L., but I actually like D.L.  He was on...  He's great, man.  He's a good guy.  He's great.  He's really smart.  He wasn't one of these guys going, 
[02:20:30]  and the police told him to stand down.  Like, he knew the facts of the case and stuff.  And, you know, we both have different points of view on it.  But my side won, and the jury acquitted.  And you said that to D.L. and went,  ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I went, ha, ha, one for the white people.  I'll tell you, Anthony, you're right out there with that shit.  Nick, I've had it, is what it is.  I've had it.  I know, and I'm retreating the other way. 
[02:21:00]  I haven't said shit about it to anybody.  I know.  Here's the thing, though, that a lot of people don't understand.  I don't get on Twitter and get on this radio show and spew just to be offensive.  What I talk about is very well researched.  I don't use foul language just to fucking incite.  I mean, but people misunderstand that and think that if a white person is talking about racial issues,  that they're immediately racist.  And that's got to fucking stop. 
[02:21:30]  It really does.  Well, yeah, the media has been playing a dangerous game for years.  I mean, for years.  They've thrown gas on the fire.  They're inciting separatism and more violence, I believe, than anybody else, the media.  It's so calculated.  Because in real life, you know, we do get along, pretty much.  Yeah, exactly.  But these cocksuckers, that television is so powerful,  people just underestimate it, how it shapes people's minds. 
[02:22:00]  And I was talking to my buddy Riley Cooper this morning.  Yeah, Riley Cooper.  But even that, even that, like, the amount of coverage that is getting is ridiculous.  Isn't it?  I haven't even watched the movie the last couple days.  And every time I put it on, like, three times with the TV on, I'm going, you've got to be kidding.  Yeah, yeah.  You're talking about this again? 
[02:22:30]  Again.  And they're going to meet with each player.  Oh.  It shows the fucking, I can't believe where we're at.  It's like we're children.  It's like we're fucking children.  And the thing with that...  Wait, he's going to meet with every player I got.  Oh, great.  So then all those players, they've got to play their role and make believe that this doesn't actually go on?  Yeah.  That's so ridiculous.  You've all heard the, you know, black people could say nigger, but white people can't. 
[02:23:00]  And, you know, obviously it's going to be more offensive when a white person says it.  It's just the way it is.  But there isn't this, there isn't this giant chasm that should be put in place that black guys can say it.  And if a black football player was at a concert and said nigger, it would be a non-issue.  We wouldn't even hear about it.  But that doesn't mean that if a white person says it, that you've got to go to the opposite end of the spectrum,  have this apology like he killed somebody. 
[02:23:30]  Right.  It could just be like, oh, okay, well, that was a little unexpected and a little raw.  But it shouldn't have to be the top story on the news, people looking to chop the guy's head off.  It's insanity that we've reached this level.  Yeah, and then you can only reach that level with the use of the television.  Yes.  You know the minds of millions of people every day.  Exactly.  It's disgusting.  But now he's got to make believe he's learned something from this.  The player's got to make believe that the guy's never used a word before. 
[02:24:00]  Everyone's just making believe in the end.  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  It's terrible.  Like I said, you come out tonight, you'll hear about an asshole bleaching and vaginal rejuvenation.  And Nick has turned the corner.  I know.  I'm tired.  They ran me down.  It is exhausting, Nick.  Nick, I'm grabbing the baton and I'm running.  You know who else gave up on politics for the most part was Marc Maron.  Marc Maron, yeah.  He's another guy.  He was lefty.  He was the other end of the spectrum.  And he said, I'm fucking tired. 
[02:24:30]  He had it.  And he doesn't, when he comes in here, he doesn't really want to talk about politics anymore.  I can't wait until I'm exhausted.  Well, Air America didn't help him, but he wants away from that shit, too, as far as  his comedy goes.  Yeah, because he used it to get to a certain level in his career.  He's a lefty and fucking now he's got his show, so why fucking risk it?  Yeah, why alienate half your audience?  See, the half of the audience I normally would alienate think I'm hilarious.  I'm telling you, I made a few jokes with fucking Patrice on Tough Crowd, and I really think 
[02:25:00]  it kind of fucking put an albatrosser on my neck as far as my career goes.  Holy shit, you really think that, huh?  A little bit.  Yeah.  I kind of go pigeonholed, you know?  I mean, it's fucking ridiculous.  We'll wait until people hear about asshole bleaching.  They'll fucking forget all that other shit.  Well, you know. 
[02:25:30]  It needs to be said, though.  Yeah, it does.  It needs to be said.  It's an important topic, Nick.  It really is.  It is.  I'm sure you guys have touched on it a thousand times.  Yes, the asshole bleaching, of course.  Do you, Nick, do you prefer a little hair down there or what?  What's your preference?  Well, you're in the front or the back.  The front.  Let's stick to the front.  That's a good question. 
[02:26:00]  That's a very good question.  I like a nice rat tail hanging out of a girl's ass.  I prefer a little hair in the front.  Right.  To me, a pussy without a pubic hair, it's like a tit without a nipple.  Yes.  You know what?  I think from our age bracket, it's more nostalgia.  You remember, you know, opening up those penthouse and playboys and seeing a little.  You know, you're like, you were amazed.  It's like there's a hair, but there's no dick there.  It's fucking fascinating and stunning. 
[02:26:30]  I think it's got to be well-kempt.  You don't want a giant fucking thatch.  I know.  I mean, look, the first porn I saw was on VHS tapes in the 70s, late 70s.  I mean, it looked like an ABA all-star game.  Is that Dr. Jake Duncan, or is that a pussy?  And I think we're coming full circle because every girl decided they were just going to shave everything off. 
[02:27:00]  And then, you know, it's kind of like what's old is new again.  And I think some hair is making a comeback.  Yeah.  Remember the Sopranos?  Do you remember, what was his name?  The guy from, he was in Scarface.  Frank, what's his name?  Loggio, whatever he played.  Teach LaMotta on the Sopranos.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Remember the older guy?  Yep.  He'd been in prison for like 20 years.  Yeah, he wound up fucking killing that guy.  He had, what, lung cancer or something?  Yeah, and he goes, biggest difference since I got out of prison, the biggest difference I see, uh, uh, uh, girl shit in the bushes. 
[02:27:30]  It goes like the fucking Girl Scout.  Yeah.  I like the nice, neat little triangle.  A neat triangle.  Right, right.  Yeah.  That's it.  Wow, you guys are going back.  It's kind of boring.  It's like a boy's regular if you're talking haircuts.  It's a nice Dorito shit.  That's what I like.  And it was the only way to really know where you were in the old days when you put your hand down the top of a girl's pants and started going down there. 
[02:28:00]  You knew when you were kind of almost home.  You know, you felt a little, like, all right.  It would really get your blood pumping.  Oh, it was the best fucking thing.  I'm touching patch.  Like, this is it.  Right.  I love touching patch in high school.  Now you're going, is that a cut?  Is that a belly button?  Yeah, what is this?  Did I fucking, did I veer off to the right and I'm in her thigh fold?  Yeah, you don't know.  Does she have appendicitis? 
[02:28:30]  I like a nice, maintained lawn.  Yes, exactly.  Thank God.  Thank God I'm not alone.  So one more time with the big plug there, Mr. DiPaolo.  Yeah, you guys, thank you.  You guys are good.  I fucking love Nick.  We're at Helium, two shows tonight, two shows tomorrow night at Helium right here in Philly.  Nice.  If you're in Philly, go see Nick, man.  He's fucking hilarious, man.  Absolutely.  I had such a good time going to see you. 
[02:29:00]  You're fucking, you're very funny, Nick.  I love it.  I think we had a few O&A fans last night.  There's always a table of like six guys that get just a little too friendly while I'm up there.  That's them.  They're well-intentioned, man.  Yeah.  They say something after he's joking.  I go, guys, just fucking leave.  Yeah.  They're shut up.  They're passionate.  Our audience is passionate for comedy.  Does passionate mean retarded?  Well, I'm being polite.  I was being polite.  That's great, though.  It's a good combination.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  They will pretty much kill for you, Nick.  So if you've got any problems, let them know.  Oh, yeah.  Like Irish brothers.  Yes.  And I know that.  Yeah, and then they beat the shit out of us.  Right, right.  They weren't confused if they're even fans at all.  Yeah.  Very, very strange.  Well, fellas, I appreciate you taking the time.  Anytime, Nick.  And it's Nick DiPaolo on Twitter, of course.  Yep.  And nickdip.com.  And Helium tonight and tomorrow in Philly.  Right on, man.  Yep.  Thanks, guys.  Good talking to you, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  Nick DiPaolo, killing it.  Fucking love Nick.  Killing it. 
[02:30:00]  He's great.  I was at, we were at Tom, did you go to Tom Papa's party when he had that party?  Oh, yeah.  Of course it did.  Two months back, whenever it was.  Yeah, at his house.  Yeah, yeah.  And Nick was there.  We hung out.  We were fucking laughing our asses off, man.  Yeah.  He's just a funny guy.  Genuinely funny.  Nick's great.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Do we?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm getting a message here.  Yeah.  Well, it's that time of year.  Oh, man.  This is.  Where we're losing, we're starting to lose our interns. 
[02:30:30]  And of course, like.  Does it happen this time?  Pretty much.  Oh, really?  Pretty much.  I didn't notice.  Pretty much.  It's a tradition we've had for many years on the show.  When, you know, the interns start leaving us after their internship, we want to at least  show the.  Are we shaving someone's eyebrows?  We want to show the appreciation for said intern.  Job well done.  What?  For job well done.  And like in the past, we are going to do one of those after the break.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you talking about? 
[02:31:00]  Remember all the celebrations?  We've been doing this forever.  Yeah.  We've been doing this forever.  I remember shaving an intern's eyebrows on his last day.  Well, that's what he wanted.  So, you know.  You know what the greatest.  Each intern wants something different.  You know what the greatest thing is?  He did that, right?  Yeah.  I'm not even kidding you.  I cannot remember his name.  I really want.  Wait, let me try.  Try to remember his name.  Because I'm a little better.  I'm not going to look down.  I'm a little better than you when it comes to intern names.  You're much better.  And I'm not even going to look down at Pal Talk if anyone there remembers. 
[02:31:30]  Holy.  All right.  He had a fun nickname and everything.  I don't even remember his nickname.  We talked about it on the air, right?  Oh, my God.  All right.  I'm going to go with dipshit for his fun nickname.  Oh, that's a good one.  All right.  For real.  It wasn't like.  Was it start with a J, his name?  No.  I think his name was Matt.  Can I give you a hint?  No.  Was it Matt?  Oh, I thought it was.  No.  Honestly.  Can I give you a hint?  No.  Not yet.  Oh, I remember his nickname.  You do. 
[02:32:00]  What's his nickname?  Alan Thicke, Jr.  Oh.  Alan Thicke, Jr.  I can't fake it.  I do remember that now after you said he had a fun nickname.  All right.  What was his name?  And his real name was.  Might be Alan.  That's why.  Yeah.  It was Alan.  Oh, it was Alan.  But I had to say might be because I wasn't sure.  Even after you said Alan Thicke, Jr., and I remembered, I still didn't know his name  was Alan.  He didn't look like Alan Thicke.  That's the only reason we called him that.  I would have never came up with his name being Alan.  See, I wanted, the girls are leaving, like, earlier than usual.  We hate losing these interns, man. 
[02:32:30]  They're terrific.  I wanted to bring in a bunch of the old interns and see whose names you remember and if you  remember what they do.  Oh, Christ.  Maybe we should do that anyway.  You know who I remember?  Intern David.  How could you not?  I remember Intern David and I remember fucking Duty Hat.  Cream Pie Jones.  Oh, boy!  Those are the two.  What's Cream Pie's real name?  I have no idea.  No idea.  No clue, huh?  What is Cream Pie's real name?  It's Jared.  Right.  Okay, Jared.  Jared the fish boy.  I would have been there for hours trying to remember that one. 
[02:33:00]  Cream Pie Jones.  That's all he was to me.  Intern David.  Has he grown a beard so he can maybe get a job?  Is he changing his look at least?  Well, I don't know because he won't talk to anybody associated with the show.  Whoa, Bubba!  Even you?  Yeah, no, he doesn't really talk to anybody.  He runs.  He literally runs away from anybody.  No, why do our interns in general run away?  Think about it.  They run away when they're approached by O&A people.  Not Sidney or Jackie.  If we ever see them in the future, they'll be a big hug.  Yep.  Oh, how are you doing? 
[02:33:30]  What's up?  You were one of our best interns ever.  What?  They're way up there.  Oh, my God.  What did they do?  You know what?  I'm going to say irreplaceable.  What?  They are irreplaceable.  Over the years, I refused to do reviews for the interns.  Of course.  Where's the paperwork?  I really need to fill this out.  I would in a second give them glowing reviews if they were in employment anywhere.  A pluses.  What did they do?  A plus plus a thousand years.  You know what?  You know what's better than what did they do?  What didn't they didn't do? 
[02:34:00]  God damn it.  You're smart.  Exactly.  You're smart.  That's what I say.  Yep.  You know how a well-oiled machine works?  You don't notice.  It just works.  The results there is what you're saying.  Yes.  A well-oiled machine, you don't hear a squeak or something knocking.  You just know that it's working.  Right.  That's Sidney and Jackie.  God damn it.  Is that true?  Two well-oiled machines.  Squeaking?  What?  Oh, shit.  We have three interns. 
[02:34:30]  He said two.  We have three interns.  There's a boy.  Oh, that guy.  Is he our intern?  I thought he was just kind of a building intern.  I swear to you, I don't know his name.  Let me try.  I'm going to try, too.  I'm going to go with Matt again.  That's incorrect.  Oh, no.  I think I know.  But I mix it up.  It's either Taylor or Tyler.  Correct.  And I don't think it's Taylor, because I would have known from Planet of the Apes.  Tyler.  They called the, you know, the Heston was Taylor.  Although, just to make it easier on everybody. 
[02:35:00]  I almost knew that one.  He's got a nickname from the after show.  It's a...  Chicken man?  Intern douchebag.  Intern douchebag.  I just figured that'd be easy forever.  That is a good one.  That's pretty smart.  Yeah.  That's smart programming right there.  Danny would approve.  He would, right?  Just so the audience remembers.  Yeah.  Oh, intern douchebag.  It's easier to remember that than Tyler.  But, you know, let's get back to what's important.  And Sidney and Jackie.  He only got 30 seconds.  What?  What?  We gave him his farewell.  That's a nice farewell for that kid.  He's not leaving for like three weeks.  What? 
[02:35:30]  Only one intern is leaving today.  Oh, I thought they all were leaving.  Now, do you have to wait until, like, the next intern season, three weeks, before we  can look for replacements for the girls?  Tyler could have a piece.  Are we getting her a little something today?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, so Tyler could have a little piece, and he could consider that his goodbye.  Is it Sydney?  No, I...  Oh.  Tyler's not leaving.  He doesn't get a goodbye.  Good enough.  It's fine.  Take it easy, Tyler.  Just in case we forget.  We hardly knew ye. 
[02:36:00]  Tyler's staying for a little while.  Oh.  All right, so we...  Now, can we replace the girls, like, with some new girls?  We're trying.  No.  E-Rock!  We're trying.  No, E-Rock hit me up with something yesterday.  I'm like, that's going to be fucking awkward for me.  What do you mean?  Tell them what one of the new interns is.  What?  You already have prospects, and I haven't been...  You've never cared about the interns.  Look, it's time I get involved.  You don't even come to our meetings. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, sorry.  What?  You don't even come to our meetings.  There's no meetings?  There doesn't need to be a meeting.  I could tell just by looking at somebody if they're going to be a good intern.  No, I mean, you should be more involved with stuff other than interns.  I think it's hilarious that you guys have to have meetings without us.  I think that is the funniest thing that goes on around here.  Yeah.  Every Tuesday, these guys meet, even though we're not there.  Do you think, like, Stern sits with the likes of glorified interns?  He does.  You two were interns once, I remember.  Stern does do that.  Get me started. 
[02:37:00]  He does.  And if you guys weren't...  What?  He sits in on meetings.  Yes.  He has meetings all the time.  Does he Skype in?  I'll Skype in on a meeting.  He stays here.  I'm busy.  That's stupid on his part.  That is stupid.  He goes to a lot of meetings.  E-Rock.  What?  Hi.  We're just better, I guess, because we don't need to do that shit.  I guess it comes more naturally to you guys.  That's right.  E-Rock, tell Anthony about the new intern.  Well, one of the new interns.  I don't know why you wouldn't ask me ahead of time, because I'm not even joking.  This is going to be awkward. 
[02:37:30]  No, this is going to be great.  One of the interns goes to Opie's college.  Geneseo.  Worked at the radio station that Opie worked at.  WGSU.  Uh-huh.  Is also in the same fraternity that Opie is.  Phi Sigma Epsilon.  And we're trying to see.  Lots to talk about.  Lots to talk about.  We're trying to see if they're in the same family line.  Oh.  So technically he could be like my little, little, little, little, little brother.  A legacy.  A legacy.  Yeah, a legacy.  A legacy.  We're bringing a legacy through here.  I don't want that shit.  Plus, it's a guy. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, that's not good.  Generally speaking.  You know what a fanboy he'd be of yours?  You're like his hero.  And, you know, you're already someone's hero, so you can't.  No.  What?  B-Rock, when did that end?  That spot is vacant, yeah.  I've been making a little bit of a comeback lately, haven't I?  Yeah, right?  A little bit.  We're cordial.  Yeah.  Ouch.  Have I broke the top hundred?  I used to be way up there.  Am I at least in the top hundred?  No, you're the reason there's no list anymore.  Just fucking... 
[02:38:30]  There is no God.  Just go.  The fucking...  How that went over the course of the years is so good.  You took a young man whose heroes were the following people.  I didn't even finish the list.  Dad.  Hulk Hogan.  Hulkster.  And you, Opie.  And you crushed him.  You crushed him.  I just didn't...  Like, he doesn't even believe in the concept of heroes anymore.  I was uncomfortable by that.  No.  He doesn't believe in heroes anymore.  Heroes don't exist.  How sad is that?  Heroes don't exist.  You stopped that for him.  Yes. 
[02:39:00]  Wow.  That's still one of my favorite bits.  Really?  Oh, is that one...  Yes.  Yes.  I think we have a winner for the podcast next week.  Yes, that should be on the podcast.  No, we're doing a suck cock for K-Rock.  Suck cock for K-Rock.  And...  I don't know if that's ever been, like, replayed.  Well, E-Rock tries to bury it.  It has.  It's so good.  The hero thing?  Yeah.  Why does he try to bury it?  We could put it on the podcast, too.  We don't need another hero.  I just remember him leaving.  Yeah.  He had tears in his eyes.  I know.  Tears in his eyes, I guess. 
[02:39:30]  I meant every word I said to that day.  Oh, of course you did.  His hero made him cry.  He did.  Because I was just...  To break it down, I just felt so uncomfortable.  So, that was my protection.  I put up my protection wall.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, why would anyone like you?  Why would you have friends?  I have friends.  Okay.  Yeah, why wouldn't you like it if E-Rock wanted you to be?  I don't know.  Like...  I don't know.  It's just weird.  When E-Rock finally puts out the list, and I'm one of his heroes now, I'm going to like  that.  I kind of wish I was on a hero list now.  You know what?  That's not far from the truth.  I've changed, though. 
[02:40:00]  Now I wish I was on a hero list.  I wasn't ready for the hero list back then.  Couldn't handle it?  No, but now I'm ready.  I'm ready.  It's a missed opportunity.  You're self-worth.  You're ready to jump back onto a hero list.  I would like that now.  Back then, I was a little uncomfortable.  Well, you'll have a brand new start in September.  Yeah, yeah.  I think you're getting me back with that.  So, a dude.  A dude.  Whose hero is Opie.  Jesus.  A little mini E-Rock.  A mini E-Rock.  A little baby Nagel.  That's a normal-sized person.  I'm sorry.  The kid wasn't even close to being born when I was there. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, wow.  I think Eric's going to take him under his wing.  Holy fuck.  And now he's...  Nope, he's all...  You want to get close to Opie.  Opie's mentor on this one.  Imagine if he embarrasses you and embarrasses the fraternity and shit.  Yeah, what if he's shitty?  We've had so many shitty interns.  No, because Opie's photo is hanging up in their fraternity.  Because Opie's featured in the Geneseo magazine.  Yes, I saw that.  That's actually very cool.  I like it, because I was Geneseo scene, which obviously it only goes to people that went 
[02:41:00]  there, but I'm featuring an article of guys that made it in TV and radio.  I'm in the...  I got the cover shot.  I'm in the back of the article, and my buddy Jim Chandler is in here as well.  Is there a photo of him?  Is he following you yet?  There's Jim Chandler.  Oh, it's so small.  I've been yelling and screaming that he needs to follow me, and then he just faced me this  morning with a tweet.  I thought I was following him.  He goes, I'll follow you when you start following me.  Oh, shit.  You were never following him?  No, I didn't realize that.  A little war going on. 
[02:41:30]  I'm on the margin of Tin Sniffs magazine.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  That's great.  That's pretty cool, though.  They did a whole article on me and a bunch of other guys that made good from going in  that shithole.  Geneseo.  That was a shithole.  It was a shithole when I went there.  Now, when you say Geneseo, people are like, oh, the Ivy League of the SUNY system.  SUNY system.  We drank seven days a week and never went to class and went through garbage to find finals.  So I can't front.  No, no front. 
[02:42:00]  I was there to be on the radio.  Yeah.  That was it.  Yeah, they had a station there.  Criteria filled.  They really had a station.  Yeah, they really turned their shit around, though.  It's a very impressive school.  It's really hard to get into.  Oh, imagine he comes in, hello, Opie.  Problem.  Yes, I attend Geneseo.  Things are a little different now at the front.  We do a lot of community work.  It's like, yeah, we used to fucking drink, fuck the fat pigs. 
[02:42:30]  It's an academic fraternity now.  Yeah.  Might have seen a train or two go down.  All right.  I say might have on that one.  The statute of limitations is way over.  And the Opster.  Way over.  And the Opster didn't need to get in line.  Oh, what does that mean?  I was always proud of that.  He was the one.  You were on it?  You were the fucking locomotive.  Oh!  Ouch.  I thought you were the locomotive.  No, I...  Here's the caboose.  Oh, you don't want to be the caboose. 
[02:43:00]  That's a wet and wild ride.  No, I saw a line form once.  Yeah.  With a keg outside a door.  And I was like, I'm not...  No.  Got with an oil can and a lantern.  Ding, ding, ding.  No?  No.  It was just...  Shoot.  Oh, Jesus.  God.  Yeah.  Wow.  Write that book, too.  Got a few different books to write for.  Book about trains?  Sick.  I just never understood the concept of that.  Why you'd want to be involved with that. 
[02:43:30]  Because I think it's like a lot of guys like to really sort of objectify the woman.  That's a whole part of it.  No, I mean, the woman might have been completely into it.  Oh, I thought you were going to say completely intoxicated, completely drugged.  I'm like, there's so many things you could have said right there.  Unconscious.  Completely unconscious.  Yeah.  Completely underage.  Completely fucked.  Yeah.  No, I just...  Dead.  Completely dead.  It's a corpse. 
[02:44:00]  So what do you mean my picture's hanging up in the fraternity house there, Iraq?  How would you know this?  He's visiting me.  Why are you in my life?  Of course he's been at the house.  Oh, you've been there?  You don't think he's gone on a tour?  That was that mystery day he took off the other week.  I could give you the OP tour if you really want to take it.  Maybe I'll put it online for the people, including a few joints me and Anthony went to that's  very important in how this all came about.  Viral video.  Gunther's in...  Gunther's, right?  In Northport.  Would the rest stop location you met Iraq at be on the OP tour? 
[02:44:30]  No.  Christ, no.  It's cold out.  It's cold out.  Although it was the first time I ate at Cracker Barrel, and I really enjoyed their food.  It was delicious.  Yeah, you can't eat...  That's what I remember from the meeting with Iraq, that the food was amazing.  You don't remember the conversation, or the jumping off point, or the...  Not so much.  The mistake you made?  Do you remember what you signed for him?  Like, how did he convince you of...  Not so much.  You know what I found the other day?  A little envelope of pictures of, you know, shit we've done over the years, radio, and 
[02:45:00]  there's pictures of the three fucking girls from Club Cadillac, the Kahlua girls.  You found them?  Yeah.  Found one picture.  There's a picture?  There's three of them, yeah.  Is it all of us?  No, it's just the three of them.  Oh, you just wanted that in your spank bubble.  Certainly did.  Do they look as good as we remember them looking?  They're cute.  It's amazing how fucking young they look.  Really?  Holy shit.  But they were Kahlua girls, so they had to be...  Why didn't you bring that in?  It's right in my house.  It's in that envelope. 
[02:45:30]  I'll put it up.  I remember them as being just tens.  All right, no.  Really?  They're cute, but they're not tens.  Not like Jackie and Sidney.  I remember them having, like, bodies.  Well, if you're talking about arms, legs, torso, they weren't bodies.  Their head was affixed to something.  Right.  Sure.  Good.  How bad is the reality versus what I have in my head?  Maybe it was a bad picture.  No.  Are you just fucking around for the radio? 
[02:46:00]  No.  No.  What number would you give them?  They're solid sevens.  All right.  Okay.  Not bad.  All right.  All right.  All right.  But we had them worked up in our minds, see.  I remember as being pretty much models at this point.  That's what I thought, too.  Pretty much.  But that's how your memory works.  And with all that animosity we had toward our significant others...  Plus drinking.  ...keeping us from...  Yes.  Plus drinking.  ...keeping us from being with them, that animosity on the other side turned into, like, beauty 
[02:46:30]  with them.  I just remember...  And then we were drinking.  I know we bring this up a lot.  This is probably, like, the 20th time, but...  Oh, it doesn't matter.  The only thing I want to mention today is the very sad car ride home dropping you off.  It was so sad.  I don't think we said a word to each other.  No.  We were just...  We were thinking what might have been.  That we had...  What could have been.  And then we were listening to our radio station in AF, and I think they were playing Home  Stars.  I really do.  Yeah.  I remember this very vividly.  Yeah.  And I remember not a word was spoken between me and Ed as I dropped him home instead of 
[02:47:00]  going straight at me.  I don't even think I was looking out the windshield.  I was looking out the side window.  Right.  Just reflecting.  And just looking at Massachusetts go by.  Just reflecting...  On what could have been...  On what could have been at that very moment.  Right.  I'm like, right now, we took a crossroad.  Right.  We went left.  We could have gone right.  And right now, at this moment, instead of us being here, driving home to those women 
[02:47:30]  we were with, we could have been nude, swimming...  In a shitty Massachusetts pond.  ...with these three Kahlua girls that, in our minds, again, were tens.  Well, we were going to...  I don't even know where we were supposed to go skinny dipping.  We never even got it.  I didn't care if it was a bathtub or a puddle.  Why didn't we at least go, well, all right, hold on a minute.  I would just assume they knew.  But, why didn't we at least ask them, all right, wait a minute, so where are we going  to skip all that stuff?  Why get the details up?  Instead of quickly going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:48:00]  Details equal pain when you had to leave.  I didn't want to know.  You shouldn't have left.  We shouldn't have.  Obviously.  We know that now.  Get the fucking time machine and I'm ready to go back, back in time.  Go back and fucking...  And adjust a few things.  Imagine we walk up to ourselves.  We tap ourselves on the shoulder, wait for them to settle down from their screaming.  Ah!  What the fuck?  That's what I'm going to look like someday! 
[02:48:30]  You son of a bitch!  Holy fuck!  Take care of yourself!  You fucking idiot!  Like Bill and Ted?  Ah!  That's the movie we should make.  That's the movie we should make.  What the fuck?  Holy fuck!  All right, calm down.  We're talking about now, guys.  I thought you didn't like fried food.  What the fuck?  Do you think past Anthony would be like, where's your hair?  It's so awesome.  What'd you do?  Get a haircut for you.  Fucked it all up.  What about your ponytail?  And then I'd fucking, I'd go back with scissors and just pin me down and cut my fucking ponytail off. 
[02:49:00]  Shake it in my face and go, no, no!  See, like a dog.  No, no!  Oh, God.  My old self would be talking to my new self.  Why the fuck would you cut that hair?  Oh, God.  Well, I had no choice.  Young Opie.  I'm kind of starting on a little thin up there.  Where's your fishbone necklace?  Oh, no.  Oh, all right, D-Rock.  You're rude.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't a fishbone necklace. 
[02:49:30]  It was a human finger.  Wow.  We give each other fucking, both of our future selves give our past selves a big Tic Tac containers full of Propecia.  Here, take this.  Don't stop.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  And then we got to smack ourselves around and say, no, you go with these girls right the fuck now.  Right.  Yeah, that's what I figured the movie would be.  Your older selves going back in time for various moments to kick the shit out of your younger selves. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, there were a lot of missed opportunities back then, Sam.  Yeah.  But then we go with the girls, right?  And we're like, yeah, finally.  And then all of a sudden, I puff up to be a fat guy.  I'm sitting in a house with a fat version of one of the girls with a baby.  Oh, Jesus.  What the fuck?  No!  Because I knocked her up when we were fucking skinny dipping.  Yeah.  Oh, that would suck. 
[02:50:30]  It's like a Christmas carol.  Yes.  Yes.  See, I'm like E-Rock, man.  You got to make sure you fucking...  Oh, I would have E-Rocked it.  You got to make sure you don't fucking...  Rubber and then bring it back.  Bring it back.  I'd have fed my jizz to a fish in the lake.  Right.  I'd have fucking done that.  Eat it all.  Eat it all.  That's where I'm in agreement with E-Rock.  You can't leave that jizz around.  What are you talking about?  You got to fucking make sure you know where that is at all times.  At all times.  Has anyone been impregnated by jizz that was left in a condom in a garbage can?  Hey, you never know, man. 
[02:51:00]  Who knows?  You don't want to be the first.  Yeah, nobody Eric was with that for goddamn sure.  You don't want to...  No.  Because he brought it with him.  He brought it with him in his little...  Yes.  In the little pocket in your jeans.  Uh-huh.  The pocket inside the pocket.  Exactly.  You would tuck his little...  Chick will fucking grab that condom out of the garbage and shove it up.  They're like one of those bank vacuum tubes.  Yes.  Yes.  It'll be gone.  And then before you know it, little Prince Nagel pops out.  Nine months later, Prince Nagel comes out with a fucking condom on his head.  Hey, one girl asked, did you take the condom? 
[02:51:30]  And I said, yes, I did.  Wow.  Yes, I did.  Did she just start laughing at you?  She probably thought you were all class.  How about a girl that might think, look, I don't want a friend, a relative, something  going through the garbage and finding this condom that this idiot left in my fucking garbage.  And then she's searching for it and going, where the fuck is it?  And she's probably searching for hours.  Thinking it might be in the bed.  No.  It's going to come on.  Under the dresser.  Right, right, right.  Whatever.  That rationale doesn't make more sense at all than what she wanted to do was find the 
[02:52:00]  condom in the garbage and then squeeze the jizz into her vagina to impregnate herself.  Oh, thank God.  By the way?  Yes.  We've done this.  I know.  Of course we have.  But when you've put up numbers like me and E-Rock, you've got to make sure you know  where your jizz is, okay?  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know the struggle.  You have to account for every fucking jizz.  I was fucking beautiful, and women wanted my fucking baby, all right? 
[02:52:30]  I've never been in that position.  Oh, man.  When you're beautiful, you make sure you know where your jizz is.  Oh.  Fuck!  Go back.  So they're not that good looking?  I can bring the picture in next week, please.  I'm going to fucking...  I don't know if you can put it online.  I'm going to take a picture of it.  I'm going to...  Can we put it online?  Absolutely.  I don't see why not.  Yeah.  You're going to tweet it today?  Yeah.  I'm going home today, so yeah.  All right.  Anthony Comey on Twitter.  There's a lot of cool ones.  To see the girls we could have skinny dipped with, I don't know, a mere 15 years ago. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, my God.  Maybe 16.  I'll scan a few of them, because there's some other cool shit from fucking gigs and stuff.  Like what?  I don't know.  Like, just...  It was this envelope full of shit with a lot of, like, AAF banners behind it.  Nice.  And NEW shit.  Nice.  Yeah.  When we used to get paper pictures.  Amazing.  Paper pictures?  That's so weird.  Yeah, it was like you'd go to a store, right?  Right.  And they'd give you the image that you get on your phone now.  Right.  But it was on this little square, like, rectangular piece of paper. 
[02:53:30]  That's stupid.  Right?  What the fuck do you do with that?  I don't know.  You put them in a drawer, and no one ever looks at them again.  Right.  Yeah.  You can't just show them.  You can't go, oh, I got this picture.  And you pull your phone out and look.  You have to actually have the picture with you.  That's goofy.  It's crazy.  It's like the Stone Age.  See another guy on the line.  He hit his jizz.  People are all about this, Sam.  Hiding their jizz.  I just don't have the experience.  Nobody's ever wanted my babies, so.  Because they weren't sure if you were black.  Even now.  They didn't know.  Jess? 
[02:54:00]  Your baby is black.  No, what is it?  My baby is black.  My baby is black.  Could you play that into break?  That was a good one.  Let me look.  And can we play this little thing that the guys put together from our Insane Clown Posse interview?  And I'm going to go into the bathroom and go through a second costume change.  Are you?  Into a Sirius XM t-shirt.  We're going to play this.  Then we're going to play something from E-Rock.  Then we're going to play the boring shit.  And then we're going to come back.  And then we're going to say goodbye to one of our interns.  Can we promote something before you do that?  What?  The podcast?  No.  Well, the podcast, yes. 
[02:54:30]  I hope they're downloading the podcast.  It's up on Facebook.  We're pretty proud of the podcast we put out there.  And they're kind of being spread around around the world, I've been noticing, which is really nice.  So thank you.  Thank you to everybody that's pushing the podcast for us.  Indeed.  Podcast and SiriusXM.com slash internships if you want to intern for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, how about you get a guy that's connected to Ant?  Oh, yeah.  Let's get a fucking HVAC guy.  I'll call Apollo Air Conditioning.  Why not?  Yeah, call up Apollo Air Conditioning.  We'll get one of the guys to come in here.  A young rookie. 
[02:55:00]  It's like, oh, they told me all the stories about how you could make anything out of a piece of 8-inch round pipe.  Yeah, I'm a legend.  Your duck worked as legendary.  It's legendary.  It's still hanging.  That's a real skill, though, at least.  You think this is a real skill?  You know what?  It was like one of those IQ tests.  You ever see where they show you a box or a form, and then they show it laid out flat,  and you're supposed to, in your mind, tell what it would be folded up?  I used to have to take flat pieces of metal and draw out a box. 
[02:55:30]  Something that would be like, we need a duck that goes from 12 by 6 to 18 by fucking 8.  Right.  And you'd have to figure out how, you know.  It was kind of fun.  You know, that's what I did.  I wasn't one of these track job guys, but I'm a legend over there at Apollo.  Legendary.  They still talk about me.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  All right.  First this, then what do you rock Scott, and then some other shit.  All right.  All right.  Step right up. 
[02:56:00]  Step right up.  And see the amazing Shaggy Tudu.  This insane clown wants to know if you know what he's saying.  You don't say, you don't say, you don't say, you don't say,  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:56:30]  Sorry folks, I have no fucking idea.  You know what I'm saying?  Nothing you have ever seen before and nothing you have ever heard before will prepare you for the shock of... 
[02:57:00]  My baby is black.  Now, the motion picture screen reaches its full maturity in this dramatic, bold story never before told on the screen.  I think your brother's on the line. 
[02:57:30]  What's Joe doing?  We're gonna find out right now. What's up, Joe?  Hello.  Alright, I hope your phone gets a little better, but what are you doing, man?  I can get off of Bluetooth, yeah.  It needed the money!  I'm on my cheap Bluetooth.  How's that any better?  Yeah, it's much better.  Way better. 
[02:58:00]  What's going on?  I was thinking about what you were talking about, the layout guy. I was the layout guy.  Oh, Joe was a...  Alright, Joe would be master tin knocker.  More so than me.  Sharp, cutting fittings and whatnot, offsets, elbows, all that stuff that I love to forget about.  But what we did was, when we took that aptitude test, I guess it was like early junior high?  Yeah.  I did well, as well as you did in that, you know, the one section where you put together the boxes. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, where you gotta fold up the imaginary thing.  It almost seemed to doom us to really have the life of cutting tins.  It was like everything else I sucked at.  Yeah.  That was like the thing.  Like, as soon as they saw I could put those boxes together, my fucking guidance counselor was like,  Well, you can be a heating and air conditioning.  Yes!  Yeah, you know, they might do things different these days.  But back then, if you excelled at one little thing like that, they would say, 
[02:59:00]  Here's what you can do and what you're gonna do with the rest of your life.  And it would turn out to be like, yeah, it's a mechanical thing, a carpenter, a fucking plumber.  All those fucking house frows are very happy now that they did so well in Olmec.  But I was gonna say, but on the other side of this, there's Anthony in the hallways cracking everyone up,  but no one saw that maybe he should go into comedy?  No.  No.  Fucking assholes?  Yeah.  Fucking assholes?  That was me playing guitar. 
[02:59:30]  Or with you and the guitar.  Like, wow, you got a special talent here.  Maybe you should try to form a band.  And now Joe makes a living playing guitar and I make a living on the radio.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  You always need something to fall back on.  Get yourself a trade.  That's what we hear.  We used to hear this shit all the time.  You gotta get a trade to fall back on.  Oh, you could pursue your dreams and everything.  That's all cute and fine and everything.  And I guess you need that as, you know, to keep your sanity.  But you need a trade.  Because when you have a trade and you're making shit money and you have to work all kinds of hours, 
[03:00:00]  you have so much time to really hone your craft to get out of that vicious cycle of shit that you're in.  Ha ha.  By the way, I'll be honing my trade this evening at a place called The Emporium in Patchogue with both bands.  Whoa.  We're playing with 2U and Almost Journey.  I'm opening for myself.  Ha ha.  Great.  It's a dream come true.  We'll be at The Emporium in Patchogue tonight at 9 o'clock and it's looking like it's getting pretty full. 
[03:00:30]  I'm surprised.  Cool.  Usually Long Island sucks for live music, but it looks like a lot of people going.  Cool, man.  All right.  Yeah, go see Joe and 2U and Almost Journey.  Almost Journey.  You gonna be making it Sunday?  Yeah, I'll pop by.  We'll fucking hang out, do a little barbecue and drinking.  Oh, nice.  All right, man.  We gotta send off our little intern.  All right.  Kiss a goodbye for me.  All right.  All right.  You know, and I think we should stay late to make sure this is done properly. 
[03:01:00]  Aw.  Sam Roberts.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe we'll have to cut through the Sam Roberts after show.  Yes, of course.  You hate staying late.  No, not when it comes to Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts' troublemaker show.  I'm no troublemaker.  Eh, kind of.  And I don't know.  Where's our...  I think things are smoothed over.  All right.  It's not my fault.  No.  It's the one time.  It's not my fault.  With hair like that.  I don't know.  Maybe that's what it is.  I've been making an excuse. 
[03:01:30]  Where is...  We're losing Sydney today.  Yeah, where is...  Sydney's last day.  Where is...  You guys never go late.  The beautiful Sydney.  No, we go late a lot.  Yeah.  You wouldn't stay for Ricky Gervais.  Especially for...  Well, yeah, it's Ricky.  What?  Seriously.  Ricky Gervais.  Ricky Gervais.  No, we stay late for the interns.  What?  Every single time.  You're simply the best.  That's right.  Wow.  There she is.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  Simply the best.  Absolutely. 
[03:02:00]  The best.  Of course, the song we play for all the interns is to send them off.  Yes.  To send them off.  We always...  I've been getting shat upon for eight years.  Ten plus years.  Eight.  Well.  Years.  My entire adult life.  I don't know.  Must be nice, Sydney.  Sydney.  It is nice.  She's done an amazing job.  That's right.  As an intern for the Opie and Anthony show.  What's your favorite thing that she's done?  Look, like I said before, when there's a well-oiled machine, because everybody knows  what they're doing, you don't notice.  You just know it works.  It's not about the specifics. 
[03:02:30]  So when I would look around and go, oh, my God, I don't even have to notice that this  isn't happening or that isn't happening.  Right.  That's how you know that it's working.  And it wouldn't be fair to the staff if we point out how amazing she's been.  Right.  It's what you do, though.  What?  On a regular basis.  Everyone just knows she was amazing.  They don't want to make you feel bad, Sam.  How come, no matter what the old interns used to do, I'd be angry?  And now I'm not. 
[03:03:00]  I have one guess.  With Sydney and Jackie, like, you know, because they're doing a good job.  That's why.  That's right.  Is that it?  Yeah.  This is Sydney's last day.  She's going back to Florida to do radio.  Yeah, I got a job.  You got a job.  I got a job.  She's the first one actually doing radio after her internship.  That is pretty cool.  Congratulations on that.  Thank you.  The first one.  Thank you.  What are you going to be doing?  The board-opping and production stuff.  Well, that's a foot in the door right there.  It is.  And then on either Saturdays or Sundays. 
[03:03:30]  Cute, adorable foot right in that door.  A teeny, teeny weeny.  A tiny, little, tiny, little foot in the door.  Cute, kissable foot right in the door.  We were there for a second.  What?  Just because it's your last day doesn't mean you can start getting creepy.  What happened?  We're not being creepy.  We're not being creepy.  We were talking about foot in the door.  Right.  Just like anybody.  That's right.  So what's going on on the weekends?  On the weekends, I get like a four-hour show.  A four-hour show.  Whoa.  You get your own show?  Yeah.  Whoa.  That's pretty incredible.  I'm pretty excited.  That's great. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, but she's going to have a better career than me by the time.  Of course she is.  Within six months.  Of course.  Should we have Denny come in here to give her some quick pointers?  She's going to have a better career than Denny and say yes.  Wow.  She already does.  What kind of show are you going to do?  Like a music show?  Yeah.  It's called the Modern Music Channel, which I don't know what that is.  Modern music.  Like Flo Riding?  Don't say that in front of Denny.  He'll tell you exactly what that means.  Modern music is...  And then he'll blather on.  Right.  What is Sal hanging out there all creepily?  Because Sal doesn't understand how things work. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  So your internship here at the Opie and Anthony program, a plus in your life or a minus?  A definite plus.  Yes.  A solid plus.  Did you enjoy yourself?  I did.  How are your superiors?  How did they treat you?  With respect?  Very respectful.  Very good.  And your boss was Iraq?  Yes.  Was he a good boss?  I would say so.  Wow.  He was a lot of fun.  Can I ask a question?  What?  Iraq fun? 
[03:05:00]  Can I ask a question?  Certainly.  Did you ever have to put shit on your head?  That's a negative.  I did not.  Did you ever have to grab into a toilet?  I did not.  And squish up duty.  I hope none of this changes today.  Should I grab the shaving cream and the razors?  You like your eyebrows?  I don't even know what you're talking about.  You never had to have your eyebrows shaved?  No.  Nothing like that?  No.  We thought that kid was Hispanic.  We were just doing him a favor.  Shaving the eyebrows before they tattoo them back on.  Wow.  Might know something about that. 
[03:05:30]  This is a...  Mars does, certainly.  This is so sad.  Do you know about the tattooing of...  Sad day.  Oh, look.  Oh, wow.  Balloons.  Here it is.  Of course.  Sydney, look.  We got you.  Red, white, and blue balloons.  Balloons.  Jackie, this is exactly what's going to happen to you when you leave us.  Yes.  It's so sad.  You, not so much, wherever you are.  What challenge does that kid work for?  The boy intern just brought in the cake.  He has to bring in the cake.  And the balloons.  And the balloons.  And then Jackie walked in behind him holding nothing. 
[03:06:00]  And just sat down.  She's already worked hard today.  Exactly.  Insane.  Yes.  I love you.  Aww.  They're opening up the box.  What does that say?  Good luck, Sydney.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  This is how you do things, Sam.  Since when?  It's been a while.  Since the beginning.  I don't know how long.  We're finally seeing some results here.  For a long time.  Aww.  When I was an intern, I didn't get a goodbye.  And then I went back to Syracuse, and I called the show one time.  Scorch. 
[03:06:30]  And you guys didn't take my phone call.  That's right.  You remember that, don't you?  I felt like, who is that guy?  What was his name?  Who are you, though?  And I just sat on hold.  Like, what?  Intern Sam.  I'm back on the phone.  They were like, yeah, we're not taking that call.  45 minutes.  Just pacing in my dorm room.  Sam, it's not about you.  Did you ever wear an adorable little summer dress like that?  No, I could have fit in it, but I did not ever.  Oh, you could have back in the day.  Yeah.  What kind of cake did we get?  I know, but why don't you tell the people, Sydney?  Oh, what kind is it?  I don't know.  Why don't you cut into it and see, right?  She's got a hand.  Why should I spoil the surprise? 
[03:07:00]  I know exactly what kind of cake it is.  I could use a little piece of cake.  But I'd rather you be surprised by what we got.  She's got a handful of red, white, and blue balloons.  Oh, now they're on the mic.  It's chocolate chip.  Oh, what's that?  It's a kind of cake.  What's that?  What's that?  Yes, it is.  I'm going to have to take a picture.  Oh, hold on.  Let's...  Who's that?  Get him out of there.  Who's cutting the cake?  Oh.  That's the cake for everybody.  Who's cutting the cake with his shaky hands.  Oh, God. 
[03:07:30]  Don't touch it.  You're doing great.  You're doing great.  Sydney's just condescendingly telling him he's doing a great job.  I'm really excited about this cake.  I just want it.  Sydney, some thoughts on your internship.  Some thoughts.  Oh, I know.  Maybe some highlights.  Highlights?  Or any kind of thoughts in general.  The fact that there even were highlights to her internship, which shows you how unfair  this whole thing is.  Don't touch it.  Who is this kid?  And why is he touching the cake?  Let Sydney do it.  If someone's got to touch the cake, I don't mind eating a cake that Sydney's touched.  Take a hike.  This is intern douchebag. 
[03:08:00]  You take a hike, it's for the show only.  What, he's going to be intern next semester?  I think I got a great picture right there.  Oh, flurry.  Just literally shoot intern douchebag out of the studio.  Intern douchebag.  Wait, are you guys sad that you guys are separating?  Sydney and Jackie, are you sad?  What a team you've made.  You guys became friends, right?  I'm coming to Florida soon.  I'm going to drive to Florida, so I'll go see her.  You guys are now friends, right?  The people that work here don't even like each other.  How can these two like each other?  Because we're awesome.  Because we have a very good work environment. 
[03:08:30]  Yes, yes.  It's very obvious.  It has been very nice.  Can I touch it?  You can touch away.  You can touch whatever you want.  I don't care.  Smear it all over yourself.  Does it?  Smear it all over yourself.  I'm sure you've got a change of clothes.  There's something different about a cute girl touching the cake that you've got to eat  or some greasy fucking dude.  Jackie, well we're made by with you.  Me and Anthony talk about this almost every morning.  What?  We've never seen a duplicate outfit.  Thank you, because I have actually tried very hard to do that this summer and I have 
[03:09:00]  never worn the same shirt tights.  It's been a fashion show.  I feel honored.  It's been a fashion show every morning.  I feel honored that you actually noticed.  Of course we noticed.  Yes, we noticed.  When someone makes the effort like that, we notice.  I made a very hard effort.  I make the effort though to try not to get out.  You dress great.  I try to dress nice all the time.  Sam, a different outfit every day for her.  Every day.  And the last week will be exactly the same.  She'll touch it off with like a little skirt or put the little hat on or something. 
[03:09:30]  Of course.  It's just amazing.  We've noticed.  You've never ever appreciated my dress.  What kind of U-Haul do you need to get back to Rochester with all the clothes you brought  down here?  Yeah, me and my mom are going to have a difficult time moving me out.  I had at least three suitcases of just clothes and shoes.  And you're not even playing the I Don't Care song.  What?  What are you talking about?  She's just telling this story and it's like, it's interesting and compelling.  It couldn't be less interesting.  This is what radio was made for.  This is terrific.  That's exactly what we were talking about.  This is compelling. 
[03:10:00]  Exactly.  You didn't got this.  You're always looking for compelling content.  Not only were you not playing the I Don't Care song, your arms were actually folded.  There wasn't even a thought to play a button.  Look at the haters.  Jackie equals worst voice ever.  Well, that's why I'm on air and you're not.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something right now.  It's a bit nasally, but who cares?  Jackie.  Right.  Bounce.  He's out of the room.  Thank you.  Out of the fucking room.  But he's right.  You don't say that shit.  I got an awful accent.  It's alright. 
[03:10:30]  Everyone's already told me I need speech classes before anything.  I think it's endearing.  We live in Rochester.  That's how they speak.  Why are we making fun of our voice?  They all speak out of their noses up there.  I lived up there.  I think it's very endearing.  Just go like this and it could sound like you're from Rochester.  Like spinach?  Spinach.  I love that.  Does anybody want a piece of cake?  It's not like Minnesota.  It's the best when Roland makes fun of me though,  because Roland only has one accent for every place in the world,  so he always has a heck accent.  So I'm from like Alabama every time he makes fun of me. 
[03:11:00]  Alabama.  Alabama.  Alabama.  Alabama.  Very nasally up there.  Isn't that where they grow spinach?  Spinach.  I like that.  I brought you some Alabama spinach.  Thank you.  Mmm.  You know what?  The sweetness of the cake represents Sydney's tenure here at the Opie and Anthony show.  Awesome.  Thank you.  But it's covering up the bitter part of you having to leave us. 
[03:11:30]  Very sad.  Very sad.  Very bitter sweet moment.  You're right.  It's very sweet.  It's a sweet moment.  She's supposed to leave.  None of you guys notice her today and then forget she ever existed by Monday.  Yeah.  That's how this works.  Why don't you join the haters on Twitter?  Not anymore.  Yeah.  Why don't you go fucking join those people?  Can we bounce you?  Right.  No.  No.  Fucking blocking you on Twitter today.  You really are.  You're a fucking hater.  Negative Nelly.  T-Rock comment.  Get that shit out of you.  She also wants to know that when you're done if you could take a moment to take a photo 
[03:12:00]  with her before you shoot me.  Of course.  I'm surprised they didn't ask her to take a photo.  I'm camera.  Oh.  I want a summer camp photo.  I do want that.  You do?  I made sure I was camera.  Yeah, we should.  We do need one.  Their office was summer camp and you guys just let it be summer camp.  Why?  I made sure I was camera ready today.  You did?  Oh.  I didn't take a picture with Kennedy.  I didn't take a picture with any of the Breaking Bad guys.  No.  I haven't taken a picture in a week or so because I didn't feel like I was camera ready.  But for you, I'm camera ready.  You look handsome.  Thank you.  Which means that you knew yesterday or this morning. 
[03:12:30]  I actually got the hair cut knowing this day was coming.  Oh, wow.  Why would you know when her last day was?  That's so cute.  That's so cute.  Because I checked the calendar around here, Sam.  It's been circled for months when her last day was.  I don't know what happened.  She didn't even know when her last day was.  No.  No.  Me and Anthony do.  We knew the whole time.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  In our hearts.  We felt the longing knowing it was coming.  We knew.  We knew. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, Sydney.  I only wish the best for you.  I hope this was a good one.  I don't even think the show has this kind of budget to bring cakes for the interns.  What?  Of course it does.  It's time we step up.  We step up and let the interns know, job well done.  That's what I say.  The cake is delicious.  The cake is freaking delicious.  It is unbelievably good cake.  It's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  You're welcome.  Can't stop eating it.  It's so wonderful.  I mean, this whole display has been appalling.  What?  As you eat her cake. 
[03:13:30]  Why?  It's good cake.  As you eat her cake.  Jealous.  Don't be upset with a cake in your belly.  Aww.  That's how it works.  Words of wisdom.  And you get to do it next Friday, too.  She is.  Aww.  She's just too adorable to be mad.  I know.  You can't possibly be mad at them.  Wait, why are you done next Friday?  Summer's not over next Friday.  Where are you going?  No, but you guys decided to take that week off.  That was supposed to be my last week.  Oh, no.  No vacation then.  That's it.  Alright, let's move around our vacation.  It's not too late. 
[03:14:00]  It's not too late.  Let's move our vacation.  We're going to move our vacation around.  No, we can't.  It's too late.  No, no.  We've got to move it around soon.  Jesus.  Aw, that's not very nice.  It's too late.  Sydney, final thoughts?  Aw.  Final thoughts?  Yeah.  That it was a very good way to spend the summer.  Aw.  And I'm glad everything worked out the way it did.  Yeah.  Yes.  So are we.  And that it was very fun interning with you guys.  Aw.  It was a lot of fun.  We're a delight.  You know what?  You are. 
[03:14:30]  It's been known for a long time that we're just a delight.  What?  She looked at Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  And she said, it's been very nice interning with you guys.  Yeah.  Of course.  Every other intern.  What?  Would shake and say for you guys.  Uh huh.  Because they've been conditioned that you can't even make eye contact with the talent.  Well.  I've never said that.  She's over there going with my peers, Opie and Anthony.  Well, sure.  Do you know what it's like to walk through that door every morning?  Yes. 
[03:15:00]  Walk past the campgrounds and just look in and say good morning and get a little good morning,  hi, hello.  It sets the tone for my entire day.  I have a really big accomplishment.  You don't even say good morning to us.  What?  What?  Yeah.  You know what happened when you walked by my office this morning?  What?  You did this.  Uh.  I did do that.  I did do that.  I got a nice smile and wave.  Oh, yeah.  Good morning.  Maybe Ann had a burp.  Good morning.  He was just getting rid of a burp. 
[03:15:30]  I think good mornings from Kenny.  You do.  And thank yous.  Of course.  And you should.  And you should.  I love it.  I think you had something else you were going to say?  That I...  Because he doesn't even talk to Tyler.  He doesn't acknowledge Tyler.  Who does?  I don't know who this Tyler guy is.  But I get good mornings and thank yous and I love it.  Aww.  You mean intern douchebag?  No, I mean Tyler.  Denny, grab a mic.  Denny's here.  Grab one of the girls' mics.  No, no.  Grab Sam's.  That's fine.  That's just fine.  No one's going to complain.  Whatever you learned here, forget.  Oh, wow. 
[03:16:00]  Denny.  No, these guys are the best.  And I...  Of course we are.  Denny, she's going in the radio for real.  I know.  That's great.  She's got her own show.  She's got her own show.  That's how it begins.  With a part-time position.  I heard.  We lose interns every semester.  What?  This is not an event.  It's time, though.  It's long overdue.  Yeah, I'm sure we'll have some.  Definitely.  It's long overdue that we should have acknowledged the interns earlier.  Right.  And now we're just starting a trend here.  That's right. 
[03:16:30]  Is it going to happen from now on?  Yes.  It might.  Denny?  You shouldn't talk with cake in your mouth under a microphone, Sam.  You're right, Denny.  Just make sure you, you know, give it your all.  Give 110% every day.  I usually give about 50.  No.  That's good enough.  There's two of you.  50, 50.  That's 100%.  Give 110% unless you're wearing a sundress.  And then 30 is fine.  Exactly.  30 is a good day's work.  Yeah, that's the new math.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  That's the new math.  Denny, give her advice.  She's working for a modern music station. 
[03:17:00]  That's very good.  Playing contemporary hit music, I guess, right?  Contemporary.  CHR.  CHR.  Is it CHR?  It's modern music.  Do you know what CHR means?  Contemporary hit music.  Contemporary hit music.  But did you know that before he said that?  No.  That's okay.  Unless it's...  You'll learn on the job.  Do you learn?  She just said...  Those are those things they teach you at radio school that don't even matter.  Right.  CHR.  Yeah, it's not...  Contemporary hit music.  I thought you said CHR.  And everybody goes, yep, you're right. 
[03:17:30]  I didn't even notice.  I didn't either.  I was like, that's adorable.  Because before she even said anything, it was correct.  Correct.  Correctamundo.  What's the slug line for the station?  I...  It's like brand new.  Yeah, it's fine.  It used to be...  You'll learn that the first day.  Make one up.  It used to be the rock station I worked at, because I had the same thing before I left.  Oh.  It'll be written down somewhere for you.  It's fine.  Yeah, you keep it on a 3x5 index card in front of you. 
[03:18:00]  Make sure you open and close the microphone with the call letters, the positioning statement,  and just always move forward.  Right.  Move forward.  And stay abreast of everything going on in pop culture.  Denny.  Like Sam does.  I mean, this guy is...  Oh.  He just knows everything about pop culture.  Yeah.  It's too bad he's such an asshole.  It's too bad he's such an asshole.  Hold on to that.  Too bad his voice is fucking horrid.  Right.  Sam, you know what you need?  A suit.  Tell me.  A suit.  Yeah.  Right, Denny? 
[03:18:30]  A little inside lingo right there.  A little reverb.  Make believe you're in a gym or something.  Takes care of a world of hurt.  Sam.  OptiMod.  Yeah.  Sydney.  Yes.  Any chance in the future that you might come back and visit?  If I'm invited, of course.  If you're invited.  Let me tell you.  Right now, open invite.  Open invite.  Anytime you're in town for anything, come by.  What do you think?  What do you think?  The intern last semester, you shaved his eyebrows, and today you didn't remember his name.  I didn't remember his name.  Did we literally kick him out the door at that point? 
[03:19:00]  Yes.  With no eyebrows.  What are you going to do?  It's on video.  Her eyebrows are too pretty, though.  Of course.  It's on video that Anthony didn't give a fuck, because I was filming something in the elevator,  and it's like, well, I'd love to stick around, but the weekend is here.  Oh, is it me?  That is true.  It's me leaving him in the elevator.  Hang it.  With the intern.  Well, my truck was out front.  Right.  I had to go.  I had to go.  So you'd visit and stuff.  Of course.  Yay!  Jackie, what about you if you're back?  Always.  Yay!  Well, you know what? 
[03:19:30]  You two always have a home here.  Aww.  I don't even feel like I have a home here.  I think what we're going to do is we're going to take a picture today, and we're going  to fucking put that picture right up in the studio somewhere.  We should.  To remember the good times.  We should.  Good times, great oldies.  Right, Denny?  I like that.  I think it'll set like the bar for future interns.  Yep.  Yep.  It's like, you've got to live up to these two, and what they accomplished here.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's so special.  Don't walk in here with a dick.  What? 
[03:20:00]  I said, don't walk in here with a dick.  That's very rude.  Yeah, I know it is.  It's terrible.  We've been talking about that.  You weren't?  No.  We're talking about, she didn't wear the same thing twice.  What an accomplishment!  Look how happy we made her by noticing that.  It made me very happy.  We noticed that.  Sam, you're looking at it like, who cares?  I'm looking at it like, she had a mission, and she accomplished it.  That's right.  That's a go-getter right there.  Setting goals.  Setting goals and knocking them back. 
[03:20:30]  And accomplishing those goals.  You look at, oh, did she fucking copy something?  I look a little deeper.  Does she have that passion with her own life to do something like that?  Where did you get the t-shirt you're wearing?  I don't know.  Office.  In the back office.  Oh.  Oh, look at that.  Our office.  But he hasn't worn that yet.  So, it works out.  Do you know what happened too?  I know I've come in here a few other days where I've stayed overnight in the city and  put on the same clothes from the night before and was like, let me keep my arms down and 
[03:21:00]  shit like that.  I knew I would have to hug Sydney goodbye, and I didn't want to be stinky, so I washed  up in the bathroom, put on fresh deodorant and a brand new shirt.  You know what?  That deserves a little.  That's so nice.  I didn't want to be offensive.  I didn't want to be offensive.  That is awesome.  That's awesome right there.  That's a shame.  Denny?  I gave him a shirt.  Gave him that nice shirt.  That shirt was horrendous. 
[03:21:30]  The Cousin Brucie one?  It's in the garbage.  It really is.  I draped.  It's draped over the garbage.  Well, you could push it in.  That should be in the garbage with Cousin Brucie.  There it goes.  Roland's cleaning his cake dish with it.  That's not nice.  Oh, that isn't.  Enough of Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie's a legend.  A legend.  And we know when it's time, okay?  We love the Cousin Brucie.  Yeah, make some room for the rest of it.  That's right.  We love that in the lobby too with all the acts that signed it. 
[03:22:00]  It's great stuff.  We love Cousin Brucie.  Yeah.  All right.  Anything else for Sydney?  Just keep the enthusiasm.  Don't ever lose that.  Don't ever lose that.  Stay golden.  I'm going to work at a radio station.  Stay golden.  Very lucky.  I think we want to wrap this up.  I don't want to overplay this at all.  No, no.  Keep it subtle.  Yeah, we want to just keep it subtle.  Keep the appreciation subtle.  It's pretty obvious how much we're going to miss her and stuff.  There's a half dozen balloons hanging off one of the microphones.  Oh, sure.  That looks really adorable. 
[03:22:30]  I love it.  There was one more, but it popped.  Well, it's right on the light.  That's okay.  Do we have music for Sydney or anything?  Do we have...  What do we got?  Any music?  Yes, of course.  Oh.  Of course.  Oh, this is kind of sad.  This is like touching.  She's a rainbow though.  We all know that.  Yes.  She brought sunshine into the studio every day.  Smiles.  Good luck to you, Sydney.  Do you know how important morale is to anything?  Good luck to you.  Let's hit the post here.  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  It's what's held this show back for years.  Shut up.  Here's the post.  Yeah.  She comes ahead.  She's like a rainbow.  Coming colors in the air.  Everywhere.  She comes in color.  She comes in colors everywhere. 
[03:23:30]  She comes ahead.  She comes in colors everywhere  She comes in colors  She's like a rainbow  Coming colors in the air  Oh, everywhere  She comes in colors 
[03:24:00]  She comes in colors 
[03:24:30]  Have you seen her dressed in blue?  See the sky in front of you  And her face is like a sail  Spent white so fair and pale  Have you seen a lady of blue? 
[03:25:00]  She comes in colors everywhere  She comes in colors  She's like a rainbow  Coming colors in the air  Everywhere  She comes in colors  Have you seen her all in gold?  Like a queen in days of old 
[03:25:30]  She shoots colors all around  Like a sunset going down  Have you seen a lady fair?  She comes in colors everywhere  She comes in colors everywhere  She comes in colors  She's like a rainbow  Coming colors in the air  Oh, everywhere  She comes in colors  She comes in colors 
[03:26:00]  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over. 
[03:26:30]  This show will be available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  After O.N.A. Live is next. 
[03:27:00]  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, sir.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  DJ Who Kid has stopped by.  I love this song.  It's great, right?  That's why I made it the intro. 
[03:27:30]  I know all white people like this song, huh?  Yeah, it makes us feel better.  It's like, oh yeah, no, we feel your pain.  We're there with you, Kanye.  It's like, you know, the most racist rapper and white chicks for their birthday.  Is it their birthday?  No, this is, who Kid walked in?  Because you guys think this is all just a little show thing.  But Sydney and Jackie are still here.  Hello.  Hello, welcome.  Hello.  And Eric, make sure when intern douchebag is done cleaning up the studio, he gets on the phones.  Will do.  All right. 
[03:28:00]  Douchebag.  That's our boy intern.  But like, everybody might think that it's like a party for the air.  It's just like, oh, we're just goofing around on the air.  True or false?  The party, with balloons and cake and song and dance, continued throughout the break.  Absolutely.  It's ridiculous.  Including a photo op.  Yeah.  Photo ops.  Taking pictures.  Like, who Kid walks in?  Yeah.  And he's just like, what the fuck is going on here?  You know what this is?  He just joined in, though.  It just happens to be her last day. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, so you have to say, get the fuck out of here.  Here's the ball.  Everybody thinks, I guess, that these lady interns are the second coming of Jesus Christ.  Because I've never seen a celebration like this, especially on this show.  How much did you blow on everything?  Like the cake and everything.  What do you mean, blow on?  No, no, no.  Like, you know, like, oral sex.  Which is a weird question.  I'm talking about, like, how much did you pay?  Oh.  I'm sorry for the Ebonics, but.  Yeah, I don't know how much it was.  How much it was.  I certainly didn't pay a dime for it.  I was not a part of any of this.  We were told.  Spare no expense.  Some real shit up here, yo. 
[03:29:00]  I mean, I didn't think it was a good idea from the beginning.  Just rude.  When none of us had little celebrations, you know what?  Who could?  You know what happened when I was an intern?  I interned for the O.B. and Anthony show.  You never got no shit like this.  I was sent back to Syracuse with no hoopla.  I was back in school.  And then, like, a week or two later, I called into the show saying, hey, intern Sam is on  the phone.  Bah, bah, bah.  Nothing.  I didn't even get on the air.  They just left me on hold.  How did you get this job?  You didn't have to suck dick to get it, did you?  Yes, I did. 
[03:29:30]  I did.  Yes, I did.  And it was worth it.  You didn't?  It's worth it.  You're popular.  You're on the top show.  Yeah, I'm huge now.  Yeah, I sucked no cock.  But, you know, you didn't have to suck a dick to get here?  No, I haven't sucked no dick.  I always assume, because there's stories about you.  You did not.  I had to be on somebody's dick.  That's the difference.  Okay, that's all.  You got to sweat.  I'm like, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, son.  Right, right, right.  He was here.  He was in.  Well, I'm not going to bring him.  Oh.  Who?  He was just in here.  Who?  Opie?  No, not Opie.  Oh.  Opie's the idol.  I'm talking about somebody I had to sweat to get the job. 
[03:30:00]  Okay.  Okay, you don't want to mention names, huh?  Huh?  Hip-hop police?  I mean, you know, I have some urine in my bladder.  Okay.  I know what you're saying.  I don't know if you are.  You have to be on his nuts, huh?  I'm not going to take offense right now.  I bet you do.  You're enjoying your intern cake.  I'm mad it's not red velvet.  This is not very blackish of you.  Yeah, black people love red velvet cake, huh?  This is some chocolate shit.  Red velvet is chocolate.  Is it?  You always thought red velvet was just... 
[03:30:30]  Red velvet.  It's just what it is.  There's vanilla, there's chocolate, and there's red velvet.  I'm very ignorant right now.  Don't fuck with me right now.  That's like, you know, what's your favorite?  What are some of the fruits you like?  Well, I like apples.  I like bananas.  I like blue raspberries.  I like watermelon, bananas.  Right.  Mangoes?  Right.  Let's go to Joker.  Sorry, guys.  Hey, Sam.  I just want to take a moment and let Sydney know how much us as the listeners really appreciated  her. 
[03:31:00]  Every appearance on the radio this season.  We're really going to miss her, and stay away from Who Kid.  Yeah, I know.  Who Kid was in here.  Who Kid is out of his mind.  I know.  My dick is on the chair over there, too.  See you next to her.  Who Kid is sitting, he walks in during the commercial break, and the guy who runs both  this channel and Shade45 is in the studio.  All right, go take a piss.  And Who Kid's idea of a good joke is he walks in and he goes, man, this is what you do to  your interns?  We impregnate ours.  Our interns leave pregnant. 
[03:31:30]  I'm going, what?  The exact words is we fuck our proud interns.  On Tuesdays.  Internal.  Internal Tuesdays.  Internal moisture is what we call it.  That's what it's called.  We film them, and then we all pop popcorn, and we watch me or whoever else fucking intern.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  Snowy in Michigan.  Sam, how are you doing?  Good.  How are you?  I have to put it with you, sir.  I am appalled.  I say appalled at the total favoritism being played on this show for these female interns. 
[03:32:00]  That's right.  Now, do you ladies, do you like that you've been able to use your feminine wiles to get  ahead?  That's hot.  Well, it is the power of vagina.  Okay.  I was a little more classy about it than you.  It's completely true.  I mean, look at Tyler.  Yeah.  Who's Tyler?  Oh, shit.  Are you talking about intern douchebags?  He reminds me of a young Arnold Schwarzenegger, like Conan or something.  What?  You remember Kennedy from MTV, the VJ? 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  She called him girl hair.  I'm joking.  So, Sydney?  Yes.  Do you like using your feminine wiles to be helpful?  I don't recognize it.  You don't?  You think this is all skill-based?  The balloons?  The cake?  She just realized she got a pussy?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Did you not?  Is that what you didn't realize?  No.  I mean, that's obvious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, why did you hire her?  I know you do.  Yeah.  But usually...  See?  I know you do.  It was just spitefulness.  Usually the work comes very hard after, but they hired you because you are young and look 
[03:33:00]  like...  Virile?  When we were going through our interview process, they were like, you know what the Opie and Anthony  channel is, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I was definitely born before.  Yeah.  That was going to be very intense.  From Bonnie and...  We had to get here and it was just like...  It was cool.  A big party.  It was nothing.  It was summer camp.  Yeah.  Nobody told me there was balloons and cake and stuff.  So you ladies were prepared for much worse.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Like...  And then we get greeted with good mornings and stuff. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  I mean, I don't...  We go to parties at Anthony's house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It took me...  With personal cars to mess up.  It was brutal.  I think I was five years deep before I showed up at Anthony's house the first time.  How long had you been?  I think it was about two weeks.  Two weeks.  It was my first two weeks.  That vagina, man.  That shit gets you in the doors, kid.  It's quite amazing.  That shit.  Did you look at your pussy before you came for the interview?  What type of question is that?  Like, did you look at...  I got to check my pussy for this interview.  I got to get this job. 
[03:34:00]  I don't understand what good that would do.  What do you think?  Are you giving...  What's his name?  Whatever.  Hair guy.  Whatever.  You giving him a cake when you kick him out of here?  The other intern douchebag.  Oh, intern douchebag?  Fuck no.  Exactly.  It's true.  Because he looked down and what do you see?  A dick and balls.  That's not going to give...  That's not going to do him any favors.  He ain't bringing that to the interview.  I hope not.  I hope not.  For his own sake.  How quick did you guys hire them?  Like, you had to interview them, right?  Eric did.  It was over the phone.  You didn't even have to come in for an interview.  Are you serious?  I wasn't even interviewed.  You weren't. 
[03:34:30]  No.  Okay, you just...  We just made the phone call.  Email that pussy.  Well, it's basically they sent out a form that said,  Name.  Please select gender.  Female.  Okay, you're in.  And if you click male...  It's like when you fill out a tax form.  And if you said no to two, you have to fill out 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.  If you said yes, you're done.  That was Jackie's internship form.  Basically.  What are you going to...  What experience are you going to take with you and your pussy? 
[03:35:00]  Where y'all going there?  I got hired, actually.  That's why I'm leaving a week early.  Yeah, she's...  Oh, my God.  Are you working for Citibank or something?  Well, I don't know.  It's in radio.  Oh, okay.  They both dream to be in broadcasting.  I got this job for being an asshole.  I didn't study for it, obviously, because I'm, you know, I'm an N-word, so...  Right, yeah.  What happened was, Eminem got a channel.  Yeah.  And then Eminem was like, I know this fucking dickhead who talks a lot of shit.  Exactly.  And they were like, okay, well, he could talk on the radio then.  And that's how Hookie got his job. 
[03:35:30]  That's actually pretty awesome.  No education.  Networking.  I don't even know what button is in here.  What is that?  I didn't even know red velvet was chocolate.  Exactly.  It's key in radio.  I am so embarrassed right now.  Let's go to...  Serious.  About the red velvet and chocolate thing.  That's some bullshit.  You fuck with me, kid.  It's so...  You know what's funny about Hookie?  I don't believe you, God.  Like, he comes in, and he'll fake ignorance, and be like, oh, I don't know, but he really  does, and so it doesn't bother him.  But when he gets called out on some real ignorance, he's so embarrassed.  Like red velvet.  Yeah. 
[03:36:00]  Like, he doesn't just play it off like, oh, yeah, I knew that.  I was joking.  Like, he's like, fuck, man.  I feel so stupid right now.  I'll show you the recipe.  Okay.  You'll see there's a lot of chocolate.  Pirate trucker.  Glass-sealing my ass.  I'm a goddamn truck driver at your radio show.  That's bullshit.  Well, you know what?  You didn't bring that key ingredient that Hookie was talking about to the interview.  That pussy.  That's right.  That's exactly right.  Well, Hookie, what have you... 
[03:36:30]  You have been all over the place lately, and your Instagram has been exploding.  I mean, the moisture...  Yeah, I've been coming like crazy in each city.  It's been accelerating a lot of...  Sorry, girls.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.  It's Sydney's last day.  She's not going to make any trouble for you.  Take that come with you.  No, don't say...  You can't say that, Hookie.  That's out of line.  I got a bag of coming.  It's all.  Justin...  Justin Stangle from the David Letterman show.  He's the head writer and executive producer over there.  He just texted me. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  And he has a great question.  Sure.  Out of all the jobs that she could have gotten, Hookie, why would you assume Citibank is the job?  I don't know.  I'm always...  I don't know.  Me being a black guy, I always wanted to work in a bank.  I feel like I could take the money, take it home.  I got you.  It's extreme for me.  Right.  Like when you're working in Subway, you could take a couple strips of bacon and just help yourself.  When you're working in a bank, you should have a couple of hundos in your pocket.  It's only been the last couple of years you see black people work in banks.  It's always been like the white guy in the bank. 
[03:37:30]  I don't know.  I don't trust black people with that shit.  I do my banking online.  And when you do your banking online, who can?  You don't see color.  Get out of there, bro.  You don't.  You can do it online now?  Banking?  Yeah, you can.  I still waited.  I went online just now.  You see?  He's going to be embarrassed in a second.  No, because he did it on purpose.  He's lying.  Of course he knew you could do online banking.  The red velvet thing, he really had no clue.  Yeah.  This one has three cups of cocoa powder.  It's mostly cocoa.  He thought red velvet is like cocoa is grown from the ground. 
[03:38:00]  You know what I mean?  Cocoa is a natural product.  Red velvet is its own ingredient.  Yo, I'm going to grow me one of them red velvet trees, son.  I don't know why I thought it was like this.  I'm going to have a red tree in my backyard.  I don't know why I thought it was like a suede leather plant.  It was red velvet.  You make shoes, you make cake.  The reason I brought the Citibank thing up is because I DJed  a private event for a Citibank president out here.  And it was amazing.  He had like naked girls in the pool. 
[03:38:30]  He had like 10,000 square feet.  All the rich corporate people came.  And it's like, if you're the president of Citibank, that's like...  So you thought that maybe...  I left the Opie and Anthony show as an intern and became the president of Citibank.  That would be bad.  You'd be the head bitch, yo.  I'll be at your shit like, yo, let me get a G, yo.  H-B-I-C.  Yo, I'm fucking with that shit.  No?  Nah, fuck that shit.  I got to ask you this.  We were in Montreal.  Oh, shit.  And we were talking about this. 
[03:39:00]  We had planned...  Anthony was talking about it earlier this week.  We were in Montreal, who kid?  And sex night was something we had planned.  Sex night?  Sex night.  In advance.  I'm scared to ask.  We were at dinner.  And there were some glasses of wine being passed around.  And, you know, we were talking...  Anthony and me and Troy and Roland and Eric were all there saying...  Eric was there too?  Yeah, we got to get some strippers while we were in Montreal.  And then everybody got very excited.  You remember this, Eric.  Everybody just...  Oh, yeah.  Everybody got super excited. 
[03:39:30]  Eric is excited now.  He's getting very excited.  It was sex night.  Because everybody...  This idea just formed.  This sex night thing.  We're like, yeah.  We're going to find, like, the best strip clubs and the best...  We're going to find, like, some sex shots and just...  Like a movie type of night.  It was a sex night.  Exactly.  It was.  Exactly.  And what happened was we had a midnight comedy show that Ant was hosting.  Okay.  So he goes, okay, we'll go to the midnight comedy show.  You guys hang out.  And then sex night is on.  Oh, shit.  Now, of course, you know, sex night worked out the way most things work out. 
[03:40:00]  But when you overhyped them, after the comedy club, instead of anybody doing any research  whatsoever, we just found the closest strip club and walked upstairs to this little dark,  shady...  He already knows.  ...Montreal strip club.  Hairy pussies.  I didn't say...  I don't think they were hairy.  The Canadians have hairy pussies.  Do they?  They're, like, closest to the Europeans.  Is that right?  I mean, you are the expert on international vagina. 
[03:40:30]  They don't use the uterine and they have hairy pussies.  In Canada?  In Montreal only.  Because it's French.  Yeah.  I understand.  That's exactly right.  That's probably something very charming that you just said.  That's just a little thing right now.  Anything French, nigga?  He actually...  He actually said, in French, I can't believe I didn't know Red Velvet was chugging.  So, like...  Wasn't it annoying, though, in Montreal?  They speak mostly French there.  It was annoying.  It's not like Toronto, where they speak English. 
[03:41:00]  They speak aggressively French in Montreal.  Like, Uzis.  But they don't want...  Like, you know that they know English, but they don't want to hear English.  Yeah, they don't even talk about that.  I speak English.  And they're like, qu'est-ce que c'est?  And you're like, what?  What?  I know you speak English.  Answer me.  I'm trying to order from the Dairy Queen right now.  And I don't know how to say chocolate-dipped cone in French.  Damn.  Pause, man.  Shit.  You know?  I can't say...  What's the French word for blizzard?  Uh, blizzard. 
[03:41:30]  And they're just like, yeah.  Un deux trois.  And I'm like, what?  Monsieur, I want a blizzard.  In my mouth.  Well, I wish I had you with me.  I know.  You know, the girls at the strip club were...  And we were looking around, and Montreal girls are very cute.  They're bad.  They're slamming.  Yeah.  They just have hairy pussies.  I don't...  See, I don't know that.  But, I'll tell you a word for it.  But, like, every girl, like...  Guy don't cheat.  What a loser.  You do, correct?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:42:00]  Quite frequently.  But, the average...  I would say the average is much higher than, say, in New York.  You know what I mean?  Like, the hottest girl in New York is a lot hotter than the hottest girl in Montreal.  Yeah, and their uteruses are bigger there, too.  The uterus.  It's actually a different size uterus.  I know this doctor over there in Montreal that told me that.  Okay.  I mean, I'll take it.  He's a doctor.  And you have a big cock.  You gotta do these researches.  I see.  I would know who could...  I know.  It's not my problem.  That's how you showed it to me, but I can assume you don't have a big cock. 
[03:42:30]  That would be your assumption?  But, you know what I realized?  And I think it might be because...  Well, I mean, I...  Because I'm married.  Yeah, I know that.  Beautiful...  What's up, God?  Beautiful wife.  Love her very much.  Thank God.  I think the world of her.  But, I started looking around, and the girls in the strip club were probably better  than the girls at a danky strip club in New York, but they weren't great. 
[03:43:00]  There was a lot of excess skin and flab and, you know.  A lot of chubby girls.  Get the fuck out of here.  But, like, I kind of realized...  And maybe it's because my wife is not chubby.  Then...  And since then.  And maybe a little before that, too.  It's a new thing for me.  And I don't know if you've ever experienced this.  But I'm looking around, and when I look around to appreciate the female form, like, I'm starting  to look at chubby girls now and being like, what's up? 
[03:43:30]  Oh, my God.  You know?  And it's...  It's the realness, though.  It's like...  Is that what it is?  You're the real human.  Yeah.  Because all that shit is fabricated.  Like, these girls are nice and regular.  There's no, like, fake butts and butt shots and stuff like that.  Like, you think I'm just...  It's too much with the fakeness.  I want, like, the other side of realness.  Like, there's no way anybody would fake that look.  A regular chick.  Sometimes a regular chick...  You have better sex with a regular chick than all this other six-pack and all this shit.  And I started thinking back, because I was looking at these girls, like, I recognize 
[03:44:00]  that girl.  Like, she's a little chubby.  But I was like, but that's, like, a positive right now.  When I'm looking at her, I'm going, that's very strange.  And I was thinking back to where this started.  And I don't know if you'll be with me on this or not.  Because a lot of people are not.  And this is true.  Did you see the MTV Movie Awards this year?  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh, what's her name?  Uh, uh, uh, Rebel Wilson posted it.  Oh, she's so funny.  I was looking at her like, I have a crush on that girl.  And she's, like, a regular nice...  No, she's, like, 400 pounds.  She's a giant woman. 
[03:44:30]  No.  She's a big woman.  Look it up, please.  Yeah, pull up a picture on that computer, Sydney, of Rebel Wilson.  Because, and I don't know if it was her confidence.  I don't know if it was because she was funny.  The accent.  Maybe it was because she has this Australian accent.  But I was totally into her.  And I have this new thing now where I'm...  And again, I'm very happy with my wife.  You sure?  You sure, man?  Yeah.  Oh, huh.  But when...  Oh, she's hot, though.  When you look around and appreciate what's going on, I have this newfound appreciation for chubby girls. 
[03:45:00]  She's sexy fat.  I like that.  You like her?  That's funny, though.  Yeah, pull up...  Just pull up any of those pictures.  Yeah, that one right there.  I want to lick her chin.  Do you like that, Hukit?  The extra chin and that.  Yeah, which chin?  The third one?  You like that?  Oh, yeah.  I wouldn't mind that.  Okay, so you don't think I'm a weirdo for this?  No, no, no.  She's not, like...  She's the one fat girl that my boyfriend actually, like, has a crush on.  He does.  She's got that cuteness with her.  She wore bunny slippers to a...  It was like a Leno interview or something. 
[03:45:30]  I like that.  She had bunny slippers.  That's confidence.  It was freaking awesome.  Who shows up at the Tonight Show wearing bunny slippers?  A tracksuit with bunny slippers.  But then...  But this is a problem for me.  Like, I moved on from Rebel Wilson to not just be like your boyfriend, Sydney, who's like,  yeah, that's the one chubby girl that I'm into.  The exception.  To be like...  Like, it's now...  Like, it's just a new appreciation.  Like, what happens if I sit there, like, start passing my wife desserts or something like that?  Hey, no, don't be bashful.  Put a couple pounds on you. 
[03:46:00]  Did you ever have a phase where you...  Because who could you go around the world being with me?  I mean, I had a big, fat Arab chick one time.  You didn't?  I just wanted to experience it.  It was not all that, though.  But I wouldn't mind messing with a fat white chick because that's every black man's dream.  Yeah, I mean, that's just a stereotype.  I would avoid that if I were you just because it's embarrassing.  I used to have a crush on Oprah when she was fat.  And when she lost weight, I just...  You didn't like it as much.  I stopped watching.  And when she got fat again, I watched it again.  Yeah, but don't you...  You know, if I can be crass, when you're inside a woman of that size, don't you feel... 
[03:46:30]  Doesn't it feel a little, like, cavernous?  Believe it or not, fat girls have little pussies.  Is that right?  Believe it or not.  No way.  I mean, you girls are not fat, so y'all got big pussies.  So what about the fat guys?  It's always reversed.  Skinny girls have better sex than the bad, incredible girl.  I mean, I'm not wrong.  Fat guys probably have tiny little penises.  I mean, get rolling in here.  We need an expert.  You've never had a crush on Adele, though?  The hell, though.  She's a little bigger.  She's annoying.  Oh, really? 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, Adele seems a little too classy for me.  Yeah, she's a fucking piece of shit.  That's true.  Not like Rebel at all.  No, Rebel seems like...  I don't like trashy and chubby.  Her name's Rebel.  Exactly.  She's got a dirty mouth, too, man.  Yeah, she's got a dirty mouth.  She's got a clean.  Like, Adele is like a deep, emotional...  Like, eh, you can get that away from me.  She wants you to hug her after you fuck her.  You can't hug that big thing.  Right.  Like, imagine trying...  Imagine cuddling her.  That's the thing.  Imagine trying to spoon a girl that size.  You wouldn't even be able to see me.  You would always be the little spoon.  Yeah, you'd be the little spoon. 
[03:47:30]  As a man, you have to feel like you could spoon a girl and kind of scoop her up.  How tall is your boyfriend, Sidney?  6'6".  And you're how tall?  4'11".  So he's just a man around you, right?  He's gigantic.  Like, when you're in bed with somebody like Rebel Wilson...  Like, what am I...  Look at this arm, who, kid?  It wouldn't make it past her shoulder.  Oh, my God.  She would just fall asleep immediately.  Oh, no.  My bone is just turning into powder.  Yeah, but believe it or not, and a lot of your fans would agree, 
[03:48:00]  because a lot of your white fans fuck white people, right?  I would think so.  Fat chicks have little pussies.  I don't know why God made it like that, but it doesn't make any sense.  Maybe it's God's little treat for the rest of us.  I'm not even making this up, y'all.  This is some real shit.  I fuck white bitches, so I know.  You know what I'm saying?  Maybe it's like a surprise.  You know, you decided to go with a fat chick,  so the God's like, you know what?  I'm going to reward you for going with a fat chick.  Like a cracker jack box.  Exactly.  He has a little ring in the middle.  Yeah, I can't wait for some caramel corn and nuts. 
[03:48:30]  Exactly.  What?  A decoder ring?  A stick-on tattoo?  I can't temporary tattoo.  This is incredible.  It's like a small fallopian tube.  It's like very slitty.  That's what it is.  I like that you know all the genetic medical terms.  What?  So you do, but you do need a large uterus on a girl.  If you want to do fallacial, yeah.  Okay.  What?  Something.  It doesn't make, not an ounce of sense.  But I can almost guarantee that anybody that calls up here  that fuck the fat chick, they all have, 
[03:49:00]  there's no such thing as like a big pussy.  They always say, oh, I'm going to get lost in the pussy  or the whole body.  That's right.  Because they got the fupa above it.  So you look at that and you're like,  what's underneath?  And they don't have clits.  It's just one slit.  Oh my God.  That's unfortunate for them.  I mean, that's all the food they eat.  Because they say food come out the pussy too.  What?  That's what I heard.  I don't know.  I must have skipped that day in health class.  Thumpy in Kentucky.  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, man, on the bus trip, man, 
[03:49:30]  you guys got to hit Kentucky.  You took a chubby girl buffet, dude.  Oh, you're right.  I believe y'all.  That may be too much temptation for me.  I'm not trying to.  On M&M tour, Kentucky, all fat chicks.  Iowa, Kentucky, he's right.  You like that?  Yeah.  Don in Texas.  I have no fucking choice, nigga.  All right.  Hey, I want to back you up, man.  Fat chicks do have tiny ass boosies.  Thank you.  And they're more willing to do a lot more shit.  Hell yeah.  Because they don't get laid as much.  They suck dick for like 45 minutes, God. 
[03:50:00]  Is that right?  What?  Who can last 45 minutes?  They're used to their mouths being open.  Is that what it is?  It's just like...  Shoving things in there.  And it's like, ooh.  Come on, a burger and a dick.  Come on.  What's the difference here?  It's like a popsicle.  Each five minutes, they're thinking of a new food.  Yeah, you're treating this like an ice pop.  You told me you had a crush on Cher's daughter.  Cher's...  What?  Are you talking about Chaz Bono?  I thought that was a girl.  No, that's a man now, dude.  Oh, shit.  I don't have a crush on that guy. 
[03:50:30]  It's a girl, though.  No, not anymore.  No, it's a girl.  She's got a dick in balls now.  No, she don't.  She do.  No, man.  She's a girl.  Look, unfortunately, we have to go.  Otherwise, because I want to get deep into this chubby girl thing.  But we've got to make room for Ron and Fez.  Sydney, it's been wonderful.  I feel like you don't like me.  You're very mean during my cake, and I'm very sad I had to share it with you.  After I made you cookies yesterday.  I'm going to tell you something.  I don't dislike you, but you didn't deserve an ounce of that cake or beer. 
[03:51:00]  That's so mean.  Yeah, you got it because you're a girl.  See you at City Bank.  Thank you, ladies.  You're great sports.  Who, kid?  Always good.  Of course.  Sydney, Anthony Cumia wants you to know, he said, best of luck and keep in touch.  You did a great, great, great job.  He actually wrote great three times.  Thank you, Anthony.  Nice shit.
