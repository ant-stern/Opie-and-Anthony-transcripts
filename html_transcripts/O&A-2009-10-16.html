<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion of the Balloon Boy hoax, with Opie and Anthony declaring themselves the only credible news source, mocking CNN and Wolf Blitzer for their perceived incompetence. They highlighted the boy's on-air confession that the event was "for the show."  The conversation frequently veered off-topic, touching upon Opie's surprising allergy tests (revealing allergies to trees and cockroaches), a proposed bill regarding sexual assault by contractors in Iraq, and a remarkable hockey goal scored by a nine-year-old.  Callers contributed to the discussion, with the segment rife with vulgar language, sexually suggestive comments, and offensive jokes. Opie mentioned plans to trademark "Balloon Boy."

The Balloon Boy hoax remained a central topic, with speculation focusing on the father's alleged publicity stunt and the son's vomiting episode on the *Today Show*. The hosts and callers used vulgar language to describe the family.  They analyzed a video of the incident, noting the son's vomiting and the father's apparent lack of concern. The conversation then shifted to Japanese prank shows, deemed "way too fucking far," with a "sniper attack" prank used as an example.  

A significant portion focused on Anthony's ex-girlfriend, Jill, and a relationship expert's on-air discussion of her.  Her "burn party" after a breakup and a videotape documenting the event were discussed, along with a leaked nude photo.  The show also featured discussion of Iron Sheik, with allegations of crack cocaine use and child molestation surfacing during a call. A wrestling expert was brought in studio to elaborate on the accusations.  The segment concluded with plans to interview Iron Sheik and further discussion of Balloon Boy.  The hosts and callers consistently expressed frustration with mainstream media coverage of the Balloon Boy hoax.

The next segment centered on Jill and a police officer, Keith, who may have videotaped her burning belongings. Keith called in, giving contradictory accounts of his involvement, initially claiming to have arrived after the event, then admitting to possibly being present and filming. The potential release of the video, Keith's motivations, and potential legal consequences were discussed.  The conversation included tangents about LeBron James's flu, a caller's suggestion about the health implications of fecal matter, and sexually suggestive comments about Jill and nude photos.  One caller was teased about anal leakage causing a breakup. Big A and Bobo joined the hosts.  Big A struggled to read news stories during a news segment, repeatedly stumbling over words starting with "st," which provided comedic fodder for the hosts and listeners. The news items covered a woman claiming to be an "abortion addict," a television station training newscasters on old teletype machines, and the Balloon Boy hoax. Bobo provided commentary.  The segment ended with more discussion of Jill/Keith and the upcoming Iron Sheik interview.

A caller spelling challenge, focusing on words like "abortion" and "balloon," ensued, resulting in humorous misspellings.  The Iron Sheik, a Bushwhacker, and a Demolition wrestler were in-studio.  The focus shifted to allegations against Iron Sheik, primarily from Brian Blair, including claims of child molestation and crack cocaine use. The Iron Sheik vehemently denied these, countering with accusations of sexual acts between Brian Blair and Hulk Hogan. Audio clips of Blair's allegations were played. The Sheik, his lawyer, and other guests reacted to the accusations and counter-accusations.  The discussion included other wrestlers, their reputations, and personal anecdotes from the Sheik.  The death of Captain Lou Albano was discussed, followed by more wrestling anecdotes.  A bizarre segment involved listener Bobo, who claimed to have a large penis and attempted to show it to the guests, causing shock and amusement. The guests left the studio.  The segment featured vulgar language, outlandish claims, and a chaotic atmosphere.

The final segment heavily featured discussion of professional wrestling, focusing on Iron Sheik's allegations against Hulk Hogan of engaging in anal sex and discussing The Sheik's own alleged sexual exploits.  A caller, Brooklyn Ace, commented on Bobo's bowel habits, prompting teasing about Bobo's nose hair and a subway restroom incident. The conversation shifted to a Comic-Con experience where one host (Sam) interviewed Demolition and almost interviewed Virgil.  There was significant discussion about identifying a member of Demolition years later, highlighting the lack of resemblance to his wrestling persona.  A caller offered enthusiastic praise for the show and New York City, mentioning Frank Sinatra and professional wrestling.

I got stuff I read every day, but I don't remember it after I read it.  I have to remember two things.  Gun laws and age of consent.  Some on my stomach.  Just relax, you're tensing up.  I'm like, of course I am.  Trying to fuck you in the butt.  She's like, nothing's going to come out. 
[00:01:00]  And I fucking push out like...  You fucking won.  Your fucking dick smells like eight different vaginas at any given time.  You got fucking millions.  You won.  Oh, you motherfuckers.  Let's just sing the Barry Manilow concert.  Are you ready?  Let me hear you make some noise.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Boy, I wonder what everyone wants to talk about today. 
[00:01:30]  What's the big story today?  Oh, I don't know.  Yankees in the playoffs.  Well, that's big.  The Dodgers and the Phillies.  Phillies won.  Will they even play a baseball game in New York?  I mean, you got bad weather coming in there.  Rainy and cold.  Nasty out.  There are people in search of snowflakes today.  Yes, in some of the northern and western regions of our area here in New York.  It's leaf peeping season. 
[00:02:00]  Yes, some peak leaf gazing activities.  A little north of us.  A little north.  And I think that's it for today.  Yeah, that must be it.  That's it, yeah.  No, it's not it.  Fucking Bubble Boy's a cunt.  Bubble Boy?  I fucking hate Bubble Boy.  And I knew it was a hoax early on.  I just knew.  Are you going to call him Bubble Boy or Balloon Boy?  Oh, Balloon Boy.  I'm Bubble Boy. 
[00:02:30]  People were calling me Bubble Boy yesterday.  So, yeah, Balloon Boy, of course.  Balloon Boy.  We want to be your official Balloon Boy station.  Yes, Sam.  Bob, put out a press release.  This is your official Balloon Boy station.  For all your Balloon Boy information.  Yes.  It'll be out within a half hour.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, thank God.  And make sure they know out there that nobody else is talking about Balloon Boy.  No one has.  No one else.  No.  No one has the information.  We have the exclusive rights.  They can call them something else and they can talk vaguely about it. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Kind of like that Super Bowl thing, you know, the big game.  Yeah.  But we're the exclusive Balloon Boy station.  Okay, you got it.  Thank you, sir.  At least we'll be honest here.  Yeah, they'll have to call them Inflatable Craft Lad.  They can't use Balloon Boy.  Yeah, well, I fucking missed a lot of the coverage because I was at the allergist.  Hence why I said Bubble Boy because that's my new name.  And I'm still, and from all the shots I got yesterday, I'm so stuffed up. 
[00:03:30]  When does this shit leave my system?  Yeah, they put shit in you to, um...  You've never gone to an allergist?  No.  Really?  Never.  I'm afraid of allergies.  We're stalling because everyone's alarm clocks go off here.  And we'll get into the Balloon Boy thing in mere minutes, I promise.  Of course.  No, I went to the allergist yesterday because I'm sick of feeling like shit all the time.  Yeah.  But I'm never sick, if that makes sense. 
[00:04:00]  Well, you don't have, like, the flu or anything.  No, but I'm always...  You just feel, like, sniffly.  Sniffly.  You know, I'm always picking my nose because it's always dry and shit's going on in there.  I got slightly swollen glands.  My voice is, like, scratchy.  So I go to this allergist yesterday, and the left arm, he pokes me with about 30 needles.  And the right arm, he pokes me with about the same.  Left arm, nice.  Just a bunch of holes, nothing going on.  Wait, wait.  Five needles in, are you going like, wow, only fucking, you know, 60 left? 
[00:04:30]  Wait, eight, 16...  Like, 55 left.  32.  32, 32 on each side, Ant.  64 total.  No, it's a tray of needles, and they just go...  And then they pick up another tray of needles.  Oh, all at the same time?  They give you, like...  You're getting eight at a time.  Eight at a clip?  So they do it in sections.  So they basically divide your arm into four sections and then punch you up with eight needles at a time. 
[00:05:00]  Left arm, nice.  Nothing happened except it's just annoying to be pricked that many times.  Oh, I bet.  So only your right arm is allergic?  Is that the conclusion?  Yeah.  The right arm blew up.  It was so itchy.  I couldn't use it for, like, the next couple hours.  He counted, I think, 18 things I'm allergic to on the right arm.  And then he went and decided to poke me where it bleeds in my upper left arm, and all four of those blew up, too. 
[00:05:30]  Okay.  Well, what was the conclusion?  Well, I told you earlier, I'm allergic to trees.  That's just like The Happening.  Yeah.  I knew there was a reason why I didn't like that movie.  You're allergic to trees?  I'm allergic to trees.  Who's allergic to trees?  It turns out that trees could kill me.  Trees.  Trees.  And you're the one that's always in the park.  Oh, I know.  And I love nature.  That's the stupid part about the whole damn thing. 
[00:06:00]  No, I'm allergic to trees and grasses.  That blue, what's that bluegrass?  Kentucky bluegrass?  It's Kentucky bluegrass and California centimeter.  Yeah, I'm allergic to those type of grasses.  Kentucky bluegrass.  Kentucky bluegrass bends.  Yeah.  And California centimeter.  So, trees, pollens, fucking grasses.  And then animal-wise, it's cats, dogs, and cockroaches. 
[00:06:30]  Ah.  Ah.  I'm allergic to cockroaches.  All the three top pets in New York.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  So.  Who's allergic to fucking cockroaches?  I don't know.  That's a weird one.  Who gets close to enough of them to actually be allergic to them?  Well, Mars is Puerto Rican.  Mars.  Oh.  Oh, no.  How many cockroaches you got?  Now, that is a.  It's an old fact that the Puerto Ricans live among the cockroaches.  Help me out.  They call them cucarachas.  Yeah, cucarachas.  In the city, there are quite a few cucarachas. 
[00:07:00]  Cucarachas.  I like the way he says it.  Cucarachas.  In people's apartments.  Yeah.  But this Puerto Rican has none in his house.  All right.  Ah.  But you have heard that they are highly allergic?  No.  I've heard that they promote asthma.  They promote?  What do you mean they promote?  Well, you know.  They got a marketing department?  They put up billboards.  Yeah.  They got commercial reads.  They Twitter about it.  Yeah, they Twitter about it.  We're promoting.  Yeah, they're promoting.  Really, they promote that, huh? 
[00:07:30]  Twitter bombs.  Yeah.  So I went to an allergist about seven years ago, and this is the only thing I want to say  that we can move on.  And I had pretty much the same results where the lady goes, you're a very allergic boy.  She goes, you're a very allergic boy.  And then she sent me out of the office with the stuff to avoid and said something like,  take a clarinet every once in a while.  This new guy yesterday, he goes, you're so allergic.  You need shots.  I don't know what this broad was telling you, but that's completely wrong. 
[00:08:00]  Did he put his finger in your ass?  No.  It was nice to be at a doctor's office without getting a finger in my ass.  I've got to be honest with you.  Novel.  Right.  Because when I got scoped, I was in that guy's office for the acid reflux.  He goes, you want me to do a prostate exam?  I'm like, no.  I'm done with the fucking prostate exam.  They give those away for free at the doctor's office.  For some reason, they just love shoving their fingers up your ass.  And the hope in this guy's eyes that I was going to say yes.  I'm like, no, I'm not fucking taking a finger in my ass. 
[00:08:30]  Please.  Please.  He was already ready to go.  So he's like, you're so allergic.  No, fuck.  You're one of those people that you got to get those shots on a pretty regular basis.  So I finally figured out something that has been bothering me probably for my entire life.  Good to know I'm taking care of it at this age.  So now when you get the shots, give them a shot.  They're going to.  It takes six to nine months for it to take hold.  Really?  That's what sucks.  But then I got some steroid shit, steroid fucking sprays and whatnot. 
[00:09:00]  Do they have to put it through the breastplate?  Ooh.  Do they?  Imagine.  I got to stab them three times?  Yeah.  And I got an EpiPen, you know, one of those pens where you stab yourself and you just like  completely freak out for 30 seconds.  Those don't write very well.  No, they suck at writing.  Yeah, I can't write checks.  You have one?  Yeah, I don't use it.  Wow, that's surprising.  What do you mean you'll never use it?  What if you're like...  I only had one episode where I was in the hospital where, yeah, I had hives so bad I couldn't 
[00:09:30]  see and stuff.  And did they stab you with an EpiPen?  No, they fucking hooked me up to some kind of IV and put some shit in there that made  my face go back to normal within seconds.  Like a fucking Wolfman movie.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Brother Elmo was there.  It just like went right back to normal.  Brother Elmo took me to the emergency room.  This was about six years ago after a Super Bowl party.  And I was feeling like shit.  I went to bed and I had a horrendous headache.  And I later learned at the emergency room, if I would have taken aspirate for my headache, 
[00:10:00]  I probably would have killed myself.  Something to do with allergies and I don't know.  I don't know.  Something in the aspirin and being...  I don't know.  So I call up Elmo because, you know, we lived in Huntington.  I go, you got to take me to Huntington Hospital.  So he brings me there because I couldn't see.  And they fucking...  God damn it.  And I had the worst headache that...  I can't even describe how bad this headache was.  They hooked me up to an IV.  They popped something in that IV that made my headache go away in probably 10 seconds. 
[00:10:30]  10 fucking seconds.  And I'm like, why the fuck are we dealing with Tylenol and all this shit when we get headaches  when there's better shit out there?  Why can't you just get that at the fucking, you know, CVS or something?  It's probably the equivalent of like 24 Tylenols.  They're just like, fuck it.  Here you go.  Fuck it right into you.  And then they're like, all right.  A finger up your ass and you're out the door.  Yeah, right.  And then they're like, all right, now we're going to take care of the hives.  And they popped something else in that IV.  And my brother goes, dude, your face is coming back to normal right in front of my eyes.  This is fucked up.  That's creepy.  Yeah.  Damn, like you were morphing. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was morphing.  Yeah.  So, but good news yesterday.  It was very good news because finally I could do something about it.  So now it's going to be a few months though before?  Yeah, that's the bummer.  He says it takes about six to nine months because you've got to kind of trick your fucking body  to stop reacting to everything.  What are the shots though?  I don't know.  You don't know what's even in them?  No, I don't know.  You're just like, fuck it.  Give them to me.  I really don't know how they do it.  I don't know.  I start next week.  So, but I'm pretty happy about it. 
[00:11:30]  You'll be laughing at trees.  Yeah.  In the park.  Just fucking, yeah.  Yeah.  Pointing and laughing at the trees.  Yeah.  As people walk by you and look at you like you're a lunatic.  You know what?  I'm going to take an axe to all those trees.  I'm going to get them all back.  You're going to see me in Central Park just fucking chopping down trees all weekend.  I fuck you up now.  Ted Kennedy's true son is Hopi.  Oh.  No, I never complained like that fucker.  I just always thought I got colds very easily.  Oh God, the son right with his allergies. 
[00:12:00]  Oh shit.  And I had many allergies growing up.  Right.  He makes his father's wake about himself and how allergic he is.  I had needles put in my arms and it turns out I'm allergic to trees.  Trees, cockroaches, cats and dogs.  Right.  We get it.  So, that's that.  Well, that's good you found that shit out.  Yeah, but I was in there when the Balloon Boy story hit. 
[00:12:30]  Oh my God, Balloon Boy.  So, you know what?  Thank God for real for Twitter and everything else because they didn't have a fucking TV in the place.  So, that was the only way I was keeping track of it.  Yeah.  Through Twitter and...  Oh my God, look, I'm watching it on TV.  Oh my God, like it's happening now.  It's like I remember where I was when I first saw it.  Did you...  But when you saw it like that, you're like, there's no way there's a kid in there.  Yeah.  Where's the kid hanging out?  In the middle of the fucking thing? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, that's what I thought.  There was a little round thing on the bottom, like a cylinder-shaped thing on the bottom of a big, like, deflated UFO-looking thing.  Well, I told Ant before, now I understand where all the UFO sightings came from in the 50s and 60s.  They always said they're water balloons in most cases.  It was a weather balloon.  I mean, uh...  Water balloons.  Sorry.  That would be great.  Sorry, weather balloon.  Water balloons.  Oh, water balloons.  Sorry.  Ah, shit, it was a water balloon.  Uh, weather balloons, and after yesterday, absolutely. 
[00:13:30]  You get a little darkness behind that thing.  Yeah.  You get the wind just right and you film it.  It's like a UFO, right?  It's reflecting, the sun reflecting off it a little bit.  It turns weird, because you saw it was kind of just like, blub, blub, blub, around the sky.  From changing your perspective, it could look like it's darting off in another direction at great speed.  Right.  You know, it just fucks with your eyeballs.  So, you know, everybody's going to be talking about Balloon Boy today, and the fact is, here's the first fucking bullet point.  Yeah.  It's a non-story. 
[00:14:00]  Uh-huh.  Like, this should have never gotten to the point it got to yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  With just a little reporting by CNN or anybody, they could have figured out that this was a hoax right away.  A little looking into it.  Yeah, all they had to do was look into it.  So, what did we really have?  A weather balloon that was released.  Yeah, it was a weather balloon kind of a gizmo.  That we followed for two, two and a half hours, yes.  Two and a half hours.  News agencies, the military.  Denver had to, like, close their airport, their airspace for a little while. 
[00:14:30]  And it turned out, looks like a hoax.  Looks like a hoax.  The kids spilt the beans.  Well, we're going to get into that.  Yeah.  That kid fucked up.  And you know what?  I always thought that Wolf Blitzer was a horrendous newsman.  Yeah.  I always just had a feeling he just was not that good.  Yeah.  And he blew it last night.  Totally.  And I hope people understand that.  And I hope they really ride him hard for this.  And I hope it ends with him losing his gig. 
[00:15:00]  Oh.  I really do.  Wow.  I really fucking do.  Did he drop the N-bomb?  Dude, he calls his show The Situation Room.  He had a situation right in front of his eyes and he didn't realize the situation.  Yeah.  He didn't even know the situation was a hoax.  Yeah.  We're going to play the audio.  But basically, the boy on Wolf Blitzer's show last night saying, look, you told us we  were doing this for the show or something like that.  And Wolf Blitzer, like, made believe he didn't hear it.  Yeah.  He should have said, what did the kid just say? 
[00:15:30]  Right.  What's your take on that?  Right.  But he left it.  And then he, later in the show, because I guess a bunch of other news agencies said,  hey, stupid, well, go over your tapes.  Did you hear what the boy said?  So then they revisited with the family, giving the father plenty of time to really figure  out how he could, like, answer the tough questions.  Come up with an excuse for what the kid said?  Yeah.  We're going to play that audio in just a few minutes here.  But we got everybody that wants to comment about Balloon Boy. 
[00:16:00]  Rape Kit, what's up?  Yeah.  There's definitely some shenanigans going on here.  This guy was a reality TV wannabe star, the father.  He wanted to be on, you know, he was on the Wife Swap show, which I never watched.  And, you know, he wanted to be known for this storm chaser, F5, finger god, man.  Yeah.  Storm chaser.  Man.  Yeah, he's a storm chaser by trade, right?  He's extreme.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  So, you know, this whole thing really kind of reeks of, you know, especially when the  boys specifically said, you know, I thought you said this was for a show.  Right.  That just, you know, that didn't hit the nail in the coffin there, you know.  I don't hit the nail in the coffin.  And I don't blame Wolf Falcon.  I don't blame Wolf Falcon.  I blame the father.  He brainwashed him.  Look, if you're going to do a hoax, like, Ant and I have done our share of hoaxes over  the years.  Oh, yes.  And, boy, we got a few more up our sleeves. 
[00:17:00]  Uh, we don't count on a six-year-old to help us with the hoax.  Because those six-year-olds can't keep their fucking mouths shut.  No, you can't really tell them something and then tell them to stick to it.  See, Ant doesn't hang out with a lot of little kids.  You will, though.  Well, not technically.  You will when your brother's kid and your sister's kid get a little older.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're going to understand.  I wish Uncle Paul was there to, uh, Uncle Paul to comment on what he thinks.  Yes, Uncle Paul would be able to comment on this little kid and the balloon.  He's a bad boy. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, we're going to get Uncle Paul, hopefully, on the phone to comment about this whole thing.  Uh, it's too good not to.  Just before I go, boys, Ant, I just wanted to say, you know, if you guys want to comment  on it a lot later, that's fine.  But did you hear about Senator Al Franken's billiard proposed about the contractors?  Uh, you know, if you get that you shouldn't hire contractors, you know, that promise not  to, that you have to sign a contract not to sue if you're raped by co-workers.  Well, all your Republican boys, by the way, voted against that bill after a KBR employee 
[00:18:00]  was gang-raped, uh, 19-year-old KBR employee was gang-raped in Iraq by other KBR employees  and locked up.  I just wanted you to know the bipartisan support that we're getting here in Congress these days.  I know it's like, you know...  You worked in Congress?  No, he was...  No, I didn't.  I know.  I was just, I'm like, I'm stunned at that.  Wait a minute.  There's a bill that he proposed that you can't sue? 
[00:18:30]  No, no, if I may, KBR, the contractors right now are not held liable, um, that are signed  through the Pentagon are not held liable if you, like, if they can have in their contract.  You know, the contractor's contract to their employees can say that you don't have to, um,  you have to promise that you can't sue if you're sexually assaulted or harassed, um, by  any co-workers.  Oh.  And this woman who signed the contract, and I guess it's a really thick contract to begin  with, but she was gang-raped. 
[00:19:00]  A 19-year-old woman, KBR employee, was gang-raped, and KBR is a Halliburton company, was gang-raped  in Iraq by other KBR employees.  She was locked up when she tried to report them, and when she came back to the U.S., she  couldn't sue them because her contract said you couldn't.  And Al Franken wanted to propose a bill that said that you can sue if you're, you know,  that contractors can't have that in their contracts.  And it was voted 68 to 30.  All the nay votes, the 30 nay votes, were Republicans. 
[00:19:30]  And they were trying to get out of it by saying you shouldn't rewrite private contracts.  It's not the government's job.  And that political, that it's just political attacks against Calipari.  We were talking about Balloon Boy.  I think because Al, here's what it is.  I'll deal with it in two seconds.  It's because Al Franken is a fucking asshole.  Oh, shit!  And that's why.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  That's why.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  And that's why Republicans didn't vote. 
[00:20:00]  They would never vote for anything Al Franken does.  If Al Franken found the cure for cancer, the Republicans would vote against it.  Because he's an asshole.  He wrote Stuart Smalley.  He wrote Stuart Smalley.  He's a douchebag.  And, of course, you know something, a lot of times you could sign a contract and it doesn't  make a difference because you can't sign away basic rights and things of liability.  So, of course, you could come back here and sue.  I don't know. 
[00:20:30]  It's pretty airtight, man.  That's why you...  I don't know.  I don't think you could have a prenup on rape.  Yeah, well...  You can't sign a prenuptial rape agreement.  Maybe the Republicans like rape.  Maybe they do.  John Stewart, the only reason I know about this is because John Stewart covered it two  nights ago.  Do you get your news from John Stewart?  Man!  John Stewart, another lib, man.  Another lib!  Yeah, why don't you be a truther?  Well, I figured you guys wouldn't cover that, so I apologize for interrupting. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, right in the middle of the biggest story of the century.  Thanks, Rape Kid.  Biggest story of the new century, and you have to fuck it up.  Take care, boys.  Interrupting our Balloon Boy coverage.  Right.  What I was going to say, you can't count on a kid, and you'll learn this when your family  kids get a little older there, that they fucking are just honest all the fucking time.  They can't keep a fucking...  Keep anything to themselves.  Yeah, you can't tell them to, you know, hey, say this. 
[00:21:30]  Right, right.  Look at your ass something.  They're like, oh, but you said...  Right, no, they can't.  No, dummy.  It's not in their DNA until I think they turn 12, 13.  Yeah, then they start lying.  Then they learn about lying and deceit and whatnot.  All that fun stuff that makes you human.  Oh, my God.  I remember my dad...  This is probably a really bad story to tell, but my dad...  We were at my brother's wedding, and all his grandkids were around when he was still alive,  and the morning after the wedding, we all stayed in a hotel, and we're having a brunch 
[00:22:00]  and stuff, and he's just happy to be hanging with his grandkids.  And one of the little fuckers goes up to my dad, and in front of everybody, the rest of  the grandkids, and my brothers and sisters, and some of the aunts and uncles that were  still hanging around, goes, hey, everybody, grandpa has bad breath.  Oh, shit.  That's the honesty of a little fucking kid, man.  Yeah.  Little bastards.  Little fuckers.  And if not, I keep their mouth shut.  What the fuck?  Diane in Connecticut. 
[00:22:30]  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right, Diane.  I just wanted to tell you guys that this guy was such a jerk on wife swap.  They were like, he had this safety, worried mom that he swapped wives with, and they were  getting along fine, and then all of a sudden, he noticed the cameras on him, and he picked  a fight with her, and started calling her names, and almost made her cry.  Yeah, he's a wannabe.  Yeah, he is a wannabe.  He's an asshole.  So he's enjoying the fame a little too much.  Yeah.  On the show, they were just awful. 
[00:23:00]  They were jumping off the top of the stairs, over the balcony.  It was crazy.  Yeah.  Well, as soon as I heard the guy was on a reality show, I'm like, all right, come on.  This obviously is a hoax.  Either that or the other thing that went through my mind, and I'm sure I'm not the only one,  that the kid was dead.  And this was some way to kind of cover up the fucking death of the kid.  That would have been a good one.  Well, you kill the kid, and then you start this story that he's in the fucking balloon,  and then he falls out somewhere he's never found. 
[00:23:30]  And he crashes, yeah.  Right.  And his head's all screwed up, and meanwhile, you caved it in with a lump hammer.  Right, and you're burying in the backyard because everyone else is searching for him.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  All right.  Thank you, Diane.  Let's go to Rob in Jersey.  Rob.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Rob.  Last week we're down in Florida, and we're in the pool.  My kid keeps, he's four years old, he's pulling me out of the pool saying,  Dad, I've got to go pee, I've got to go pee.  I was like, look, Fred, just go in the pool.  It's fine.  I was going to whisper it to him.  He's like, well, I'm supposed to go pee in the potty. 
[00:24:00]  I was like, look, I pee in the pool.  Everybody pees in the pool.  So he announces to everyone, my wife, my wife's aunt, my mother-in-law, my father-in-law,  hey, everybody, I'm going to pee in the pool.  And Dad pees in the pool, too.  My wife's aunt freaks out.  She's like, no, you know what?  I don't go in the pool.  That's disgusting.  And I'm like, look, everybody's fucking pees in the pool.  And it was just a whole fiasco.  And to this day, I'm still, like, testifying for myself that, you know, that everyone does it.  He ratted you out.  Yeah, but that's the problem that I brought up. 
[00:24:30]  Kids are just always going to be honest.  Kids are rats.  They're a bunch of rats.  So for this father to think that the six-year-old was going to be able to keep the secret of this big hoax,  he's nuts to think that.  He's completely, he's completely in shame.  Like, kids have no filter between what you tell them and what they tell the entire world.  Right, right, absolutely.  Very good.  Yeah, the pool thing, too, man.  Every once in a while, you get somebody that, you know, leaves a pool, and you're like, where are you going?  Oh, I've got to go to the bathroom.  And you look at them like, what? 
[00:25:00]  Are you kidding me?  There's a giant toilet right here.  You pee in your pool, right?  Huh?  I shit in my pool.  I don't care.  I'll fucking do anything.  Of course everyone pees in the pool.  Let's say hi to this dude in Canada.  Dude in Canada, what's up?  Hey, I love the show, Will.  Thank you, sir.  Yesterday, I was flipping back and forth to CNN and Fox, and I'm just waiting, you know,  going to watch this kid fall out of the balloon or something.  I flipped it over to Fox.  It was about a half hour before it landed, and that Neil Cavuto was going, this smells like a hoax. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, yeah?  And I remember thinking, what the fuck, eh?  Like, how can he say such a thing?  And it turns out it was true.  Yeah, good for him, you know?  Because I think a lot of people thought that this was very suspicious, but in all honesty,  it makes great TV.  It's a great story.  The kid's name is Falcon, and he's in the air in a fucking weather balloon.  He's flying around.  And he's flying out of control with copters, yeah, choppers and whatnot. 
[00:26:00]  It's a great story.  This is like fucking Jessica in the Well and whatnot.  Yeah.  We love these stories.  So if you're CNN, and you're starting to get the feeling it's a hoax, you cover your  ass a little bit, and you keep going with the story.  Yep.  You know, that's what they do, unfortunately.  They're not honest.  Not when there's ratings involved.  Bruce Willis from the future would have known that it was a hoax, because he would have known  when he was a kid, he would have heard the story that the kid was just hiding, and it 
[00:26:30]  was a hoax.  12 Monkeys.  Oh, fuck.  Remember, that's how, like...  I gotta see 12 Monkeys.  That's how the woman, the doctor, figured out he was telling the truth, because she's  sitting there, and he said it was a hoax, and he remembers it when he was a kid, and  then she's watching the news, and they said, oh, the kid's safe and sound.  He was hiding in the barn.  Oh, wow.  That's what this is all about.  The same thing, right?  Fake.  All right.  A bunch of people brought to my attention about this expert on CNN. 
[00:27:00]  They had to dig up experts.  I don't know how you dig up experts on weather balloons.  How do you get balloon boy experts?  Right.  And experts on how you need to take this down, and make sure the boy who was supposed to  be in there was safe, and then this...  Sidewinder missile will take that fucker right down, I think.  How would you do that?  And then, the best part of the whole day was that dummy.  Who was the dummy that was chasing the weather balloon when it was close to the ground? 
[00:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Trying to get to the balloon in time to maybe do something in case the kid was in there.  And he grabbed the rope.  And he just failed miserably, and then he kind of threw his hands up in the air like,  well, I tried.  Epic.  Who was that guy?  I don't know.  Do we know?  Just some guy in a truck.  Was this just Joe Commuter?  Yeah.  Just some guy in a truck following it.  Right.  When it came down on the ground.  Landed pretty soft.  Very softly.  Here's the expert.  This is what went on live on CNN headline news. 
[00:28:00]  But then, when you really kind of settle down, and you realize that somewhere in there,  either this is a prank, or this is kids doing whatever kids do, and this got to be an extreme,  we can't lose the sight that there has to be some measures taken.  And I'm not suggesting that we just start spanking the kid.  Oh, we just lost Don.  How about that, Gail?  What sort of measures?  Did he say spanking it?  Well, spanking the kid.  Yeah.  But I guess they're, you know, that's just such a no-no now. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  That they just dumped out of him and made believe they lost a fee.  We don't spank children these days.  Right.  They got rid of him pronto.  I'd have given the kid a sound thrashing after he ratted me out on Wolf Blitzer's fucking show.  Oh, my God.  No kidding.  Like, dude, we prepped this whole thing, and you just blew it.  And the father knew that the whole thing was blown, and Wolf Blitzer's not even picking up on the body language of the father.  We should play that clip now, what the fuck?  Take direction.  Right.  Like fucking Spanky or Alfalfa.  Right.  Like those kids. 
[00:29:00]  Hal Roach knew how to whip them into shape.  You've got to smack the kid around a little bit.  Yeah, keep them behaving.  You feel that?  Whack.  You're going to get another one unless you take direction.  I would have gave the kid some Valium or something, so he's a little drugged up for the Wolf Blitzer interview.  Oh, so he's a little fucked up, like the altitude got some?  Yeah, well, not even that, just like, look, he's very, you know, distraught right now, as you can see.  So let's please not ask him too many questions here.  Were you up in the, yeah, I was up in the sky.  Turn him into that kid coming back from the dentist. 
[00:29:30]  Is this real life?  Yeah, yeah, give him that shit, whatever he had.  Ah!  He just starts screaming.  The father just didn't plan it out.  Counting on the six-year-old to help him out with his hoax.  What do you say?  What a dummy.  That is the weakest link in the chain of the hoax right there, is when you let the six-year-old talk.  So look, I don't want to let Wolf Blitzer off the hook whatsoever today.  No.  I want to tweet all day long that he's just an ass and a horrible newsman. 
[00:30:00]  Balloon Boy blows it.  You're going to hear him say, you told us we did it for the show.  Yeah.  Will Blitzer had to hear it.  He's interviewing him.  Doesn't acknowledge the boy says it.  And then you can hear the father still trying to answer the question, but he knows in his head, like, holy shit, this little fucker fucked me.  He just ratted me out.  Listen closely.  We believe 100% that he was on board.  And Falcon was in the garage this whole time. 
[00:30:30]  I don't know if Falcon can hear me, but was he, because I know at some point he fell asleep in that garage,  but he was hiding out because he thought you were going to punish him for something that happened earlier in the day.  Did he hear anything?  Did he hear you screaming out, Falcon, Falcon?  He's asking Falcon, did you hear us calling your name at any time?  You did?  You did?  Why didn't you?  You did?  See, right there you should know.  Uh-oh.  Oh, the kid's falling apart on me.  The kid's falling apart. 
[00:31:00]  This is no Haley Joel Osment.  Right.  This kid's fucking falling apart on me.  Right.  It's not some little Hollywood fucking...  You're right.  It's like Dakota.  Yeah, this is not little Dakota Fanning taking direction perfectly.  Right.  This is some dumb little kid who's ready to fall apart on you.  You should have called Steven Spielberg pronto.  Yeah.  Could give my kid some acting lessons.  We're about to do a big interview.  Get that little kid from Close Encounters. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  Where was he?  Fuck, you're so right.  I went up in the sky.  You were up in the sky.  Mom, he saw you up in the sky.  See, it was perfect.  Get that little fucker.  And the father's acting and the mom's acting.  Oof.  Yeah, not very good.  They're made for reality programming.  Not good, right.  And did you hear us calling your name at any time?  Hmm?  You did?  You did?  You did?  Why didn't you come out?  You did?  And then he sets it up. 
[00:32:00]  Like, why didn't you come out?  And now...  You didn't have to ask that question.  Let Wolf Blitzer try to get to that point.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't fucking give up, you know, give up the information.  Maybe Wolf won't ask him.  You don't say, why didn't you come out and hoping that the practice answer was going to come out?  Why didn't you come out?  You were in the...  You know, you were scared that I was going to be you.  Remember how we practiced this for the last hour?  Why didn't you come out?  You were petrified.  I was going to, like, punish you.  Right.  Just give him the...  Because he probably forgot.  Kids are like goldfish. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  I forgot.  Chris asked from Canada, do you think Geraldo was saying, there's a kid, there's a kid in a balloon.  Look, there, a kid, a kid in a balloon.  I don't know.  Eh, dunce.  You did?  You did?  Why didn't you come out?  Um, you guys said that we did this for the show.  I, nigh.  I, nigh. 
[00:33:00]  I, nigh.  I, nigh.  I, nigh.  Did it for the shy.  I, nigh.  You think the kid was negotiating for, like, a higher allowance?  Yeah.  And the father wouldn't give in, so he's like, oh, yeah?  Watch what I fucking do to you on CNN.  Fuck you, pops.  Fuck you.  Hanging you out to dry.  So, there's the kid basically saying, look.  You said.  You said, you know, we were doing this for the show. 
[00:33:30]  What show, by the way?  Uh, that storm, is it Storm Chasers?  So, he's got another show, this guy?  I, I'm not.  That's where I'm confused.  I'm not sure of this.  He was on that, that wife swap thing twice.  Twice.  And now, I believe he is on that Storm Chasers show.  Okay.  Which I think features different Storm Chasers.  I don't think it's just him chasing storms.  I think it's different Storm Chasers.  But he will become the Storm Chaser if, if, if we buy into this.  A little publicity.  He's sending up a balloon with equipment in it that's supposed to go into a storm. 
[00:34:00]  Uh, and, uh, the kid gets carried away in it.  Yeah.  Off to the wonderful land of Oz.  And, uh, it, it makes it one of those good stories.  He's got a lot of publicity for the Storm Chasers show.  Right.  That's the show that the little kid was ratting him out with.  Jesus.  So.  That's hysterical.  You dumb little fuck.  Well, not as dumb as Wolf Blitzer.  Once again.  No, Wolf and the father.  Let's bring it back to Wolf Blitzer.  He's a dummy. 
[00:34:30]  Now you got it.  He had something.  Now you just rail the family.  Now you got him.  If you don't want to go after the six-year-old, you go right after the dad.  Like, what is he, what?  Are you trying to say that this whole thing, it was a hoax?  You turn right to the father and go, excuse me, sir, your son just said that you said  he did this for the show.  So now, we love breaking things down, so I backed it up a little bit so you hear the  kid again.  Then you'll hear Wolf Blitzer not acknowledging it, which is just so ridiculous. 
[00:35:00]  No.  He had something.  And then you hear the father just humming a ha, because he knows.  Ed Naughton.  He knows it's over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, you guys said that we did this for the show.  Man.  No.  You didn't, um, come out?  Oh, like you never said it. 
[00:35:30]  You didn't, uh, come out?  Well, the father goes, yeah.  Yeah.  Like, he's just waiting for Wolf Blitzer to just kill him.  Yeah, yeah.  He's just waiting.  He's wincing, like, oh, here it comes, Wolf's gotta hit me.  And it never comes, and then he's like, well, I gotta fill up the dead air, and that's  when he just...  And he changes the subject.  Yeah.  Man.  Yeah.  No.  You didn't, um, come out?  No.  Um, I heard what he said, but I'm sure not, I'm not, it wasn't really clear what was his, 
[00:36:00]  his reasoning why he heard, he heard you screaming, Falcon, Falcon, and I'm sure he heard  his mom screaming, Falcon, Falcon, but why didn't he come out of the garage at that point?  Holy shit, Wolf, wake the fuck up!  Did you just hear it?  The kid said, because we did it for the show, that's why it didn't come out!  Here's what Wolf should have said.  He's just kidding a little fucking manners.  Holy shit, Wolf missed, that is a swing and a miss. 
[00:36:30]  Swing and a major miss.  You didn't even see it coming.  His credibility should just drop like that weather balloon did.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  And I'm sure he heard his mom screaming, Falcon, Falcon, but why didn't he come out of the garage  at that point?  Well, you know, whenever he, whenever we tell him things like, you know, it's a bad thing  to do, he does go and hide, he cowls down, and like if we go to the store and he wants 
[00:37:00]  to buy some candy or something, I have to tell him no.  So he's always behind.  I mean, the other boys are always telling him, hurry, Falcon, hurry.  So he does, um, he's just trying to cover now.  He's going to do that.  Did you think, uh, Mayumi, did you think it was possible that, Wolf Blitzer, you're just  a dope, and I always knew it.  You said it.  There's your situation, buddy, and you blew it.  And the father, like I said once again, he's just, uh, he knows it's over. 
[00:37:30]  Uh, he, cause when I, they, with the boys, I, well, he always, and, uh, he didn't answer  anything there.  You ratted me out.  Right.  Gang, gang, gang.  Just say gang, gang, gang.  Uh, let's see.  Larry King.  Wolf, how important are the ears?  Denver Pets.  Uh, I wasn't listening.  I thought I was an asshole. 
[00:38:00]  You need some garlic for your hearing.  Uh, Kent, the movie guy.  Kent, what's up?  Hey, I just really wanted to, uh, help promote, uh, the film Paranormal Activity.  It's opening wide this weekend, and I just got done seeing it about an hour ago with a  completely packed audience, and it was amazing.  Kent.  And, and, with all the really crappy, you know.  Uh, Kent?  Um.  Yeah.  Uh, we, we're talking about Balloon Boy. 
[00:38:30]  Balloon Boy.  Yeah, I know, but I called it Balloon Boy.  And you thought this would be a perfect opportunity to promote a movie?  We're, we're the exclusive Balloon Boy, um, channel right now.  Yeah.  This is your, this is your team Balloon Boy coverage.  Right.  You're blowing the team coverage.  It's part of the exclusivity of this big story.  And, you know, you call in with a, a movie review.  Before you were talking about this. 
[00:39:00]  This kind of comes out of left field.  Maybe you should go hide in the attic.  Uh, while the rest of the show happens.  So, we all should see, I did see Balloon Boy on, on Wife Swap, and I can tell you that  the family's nuts, and that, that dad makes the kids wear their clothes while they're sleeping  in case a store is coming.  Oh, really?  That, that's all bullshit.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Ken, paranormal activity.  You know what?  We are an ADD show, but, I mean, Jesus.  Balloon Boy.  Jesus. 
[00:39:30]  I mean, Jesus.  Holy shit.  Kent.  Holy shit.  But you said, this is about Balloon Boy.  That's the movie, by the way, that was made for what?  200 bucks or something?  $11,000.  11 G's.  11 G's, and it's going to make millions, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  And you really liked it?  I, everyone in the theater loved it.  A lot of people were screaming.  It's, it's really good.  It's better than all the Hollywood crap that's going to come to.  Yeah, but Kent, there's a million scary movies that come across our movie screens. 
[00:40:00]  Why did you like, uh, Paranormal Activity?  What makes this such a special, what makes this such a special horror movie?  Which is where you hang up on me.  Yeah.  Waiting.  Yeah.  You put it on the answer, and you'll hang up on me.  Was it better than Cats?  Kent.  Yes?  No, we're, we're now into the phone call.  I'm not going to hang up on you.  Okay.  I, I, I, I would have, I would have by now, so just tell me what's, makes this a, a special 
[00:40:30]  horror movie.  It's everything you like about Goat.  Hey, stupid Kent.  Now we're out of our, now we're out of our fucking flow.  Let's talk about a movie.  Are you kidding me?  Come on.  The world is talking about Balloon Boy.  Balloon Boy.  They're even talking about it in China, I think.  Oh, they have to be.  I think.  I can't read that shit.  Yes.  But it looks like they're talking about it.  Ooh.  What happened?  A little short, uh, blue number.  Dude, are you fucking pining away for her or what? 
[00:41:00]  No, no, no.  There's rumors that there might be a part two to this whole thing.  No, I'm just appreciating the, um.  Would you?  A little, uh, still short.  It's a little leggy.  Would you take a phone call from Jill Nicolini or not?  What?  I, I'm just complimenting.  There's rumors out there.  I'm just complimenting the way she looks.  Is part two on the way or what?  Is the sequel about to happen?  No, I don't, uh, I don't, uh.  Are you hoping?  Are you pining?  But you said it was for the show.  Yeah, that's what you did about a year and a half ago. 
[00:41:30]  But you said it was for the show.  Whoops.  That was me blowing up your smile.  You said you were doing it for the show.  For the show.  Whoopsie.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, shit.  Uh, Larry King checking in.  Larry!  Larry.  Hello, boys.  Hi, Larry.  How are you?  Hey, Larry.  CNN blew it.  Why didn't they wake me up?  I had just done two good lines of garlic. 
[00:42:00]  I would have picked up on it.  That damn wolf.  Go ahead and creep on.  Awful.  I'm not quite on your mind tonight.  He sounds like someone else.  I can't put my finger on it.  He sounds like a Monopoly character or something.  Yeah, he just doesn't sound like Larry.  Yeah.  Thank you, Larry.  Thank you.  That's too much energy for Larry.  Yeah, that's a little, uh, that's crazy.  A little more miserable, a little less energy.  Uh, Tyler.  Good evening.  Hey.  Hey, uh...  Hey, by the way, Stephen S., go fuck yourself, you cocksucker. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, my God.  Giving away my fucking secrets.  Go fucking...  Holy shit.  ...fucking drown your sorrows in more beer, you cock.  Where?  Where should he do that?  At FH Riley's in the heart of Huntington Village, 400 New York Avenue.  I'll be there Saturday before the Islanders, uh, play this Saturday.  I'll be at the big, uh, Islanders game, too.  So, are you, are you now, like, um, drinking away your sorrows before the games?  Is that what you do?  Yeah, fuck.  Usually you wait until after the game when they lose, and then you could, like, ah, I 
[00:43:00]  gotta drown my sorrows.  I still got hope in this damn team.  Do you?  Yeah, they're a young, scrappy team that like to fight.  I like a team that likes to fight.  Gooning it up, the Islanders?  You see the nine-year-old, uh, doing that goal thing?  I, I tweeted it the other night.  He did it for the show.  Did you see this fucking thing?  When Danny comes back in studio, you gotta see, if you go to my Twitter, OP Radio, it's  not that far down.  Uh, I think it was at a Bruins game, you know how they have the little fuckers come on the  ice and entertain you for a few minutes?  Yeah.  It's adorable.  This kid, he's nine years old, he, he comes down the ice, I can't even describe the fucking 
[00:43:30]  shot.  Really good.  And you don't even really like hockey, but I'm gonna show you something, Anthony.  No, no, I appreciate hockey.  I'm gonna show you something today, and you're gonna go, holy mother of God.  I, I guarantee it.  See, the only sport I don't like is basketball.  I like hockey.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  But I don't really pay much attention to it.  Yeah.  But, uh, I appreciate it.  Here it is.  You gotta watch it for yourself, obviously.  It's all over YouTube, it's on my, uh, Twitter if you wanna go there, but Anthony's  about to see the most amazing goal I've ever seen. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I don't even, I, I don't even know how to describe this.  Dude, he flipped that thing up on the stick.  But he did a 360.  It was like a lacrosse move.  He did a 360.  As he's turning, he gets the puck on the stick, and then spins completely around and throws  it in the net.  Everybody is talking about this fucking goal.  Sign that kid up.  Yeah, the Islanders could use that kid. 
[00:44:30]  How the, how do you figure out you can do that?  At nine.  The kid's nine, supposedly.  He cuts it like a spatula.  Right.  He uses the stick like a spatula.  He scoops it up, and then spinning around, using like, you know, a centrifugal force to  hold the puck on the stick.  Right.  He gets it up airborne and throws it into the net like a lacrosse stick.  It's insane.  It's, like I said, it's everywhere. 
[00:45:00]  I mean, a quick search, you'll find it for yourself.  By the way, the reason I just cursed out Stephen S., he writes, and this is, he's giving  away my fucking tricks, he writes, uh, hey, Opa, I love how you're yelling at Kent, the  movie guy, yet you're the one who picked up his call.  Ah, Steve from Asia.  You douchebag.  Don't give away my tricks, you fuck.  Ah.  He's like Falcons.  Right.  He just fucking, he's like Falcons.  Yeah, man.  Wait a minute, you took the call. 
[00:45:30]  Ah, I'm not, I'm not.  So.  It's one of my greatest tricks ever.  Yes, of course.  See, I never had to go to Kent, and I could have kept this on topic, but I knew that we  could, like, beat up Kent for a few minutes.  But in the end, it's my fault for taking it.  You took the call.  And Stephen S. was the only one that picked up on that, you cocks.  Steve.  That's fucking true.  That's funny.  All right, listen, we're going to take a break, and so, where are we at here?  We want more phone calls on Balloon Boy, but Wolf Blitzer, so.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, Tyler, what's up?  Oh.  Hey, I just find it quite coincidental that this White Swap show aired, I think, the day  before this balloon incident happened.  I've got to be totally honest with you, I decided not to listen at all.  Hmm.  And it's no fault of yours, Tyler.  I just went somewhere else.  What did you just say?  That the White Swap episode played the day before this actually happened. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, the episode he was in?  Yes.  Oh.  Oh, that's the, that's some weird timing.  Well.  I think the news should have picked up on some of these points.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Fake.  Thank you, Tyler.  Okay, bye-bye.  All right.  Phony.  So, man, after the break, so Wolf Blitzer blows it.  That's where we're at, right?  Yeah.  Kid says, we did it for the show, and Wolf really didn't really acknowledge that that was  said, and the father obviously went, oh my God, I'm so done.  Yeah.  I'm so fucking done, but try to continue the live interview with Wolf Blitzer, expecting 
[00:47:00]  the whole time for Wolf Blitzer to attack.  And then, I guess, after the interview was over, everybody started calling CNN.  Like, even like just regular viewers, I heard.  I said, look, you fucking idiot.  Yeah.  The kid just said, we did it for the show.  How'd you miss that?  You know, the show that this wife swap show, or the storm chaser show, you know, the show  that they're part of.  So, then Wolf got the family back on a little later, but at that point, it was too late,  but we're going to play that audio.  Oh, good.  I want to see how this guy covers.  Where he starts trying to rip into the father and stuff, but now it's too late. 
[00:47:30]  You blew the moment.  So, we're going to do that right after the break, and we'll definitely continue with your  phone calls on this topic before we move on to other things.  Thanks.  Opie and Anthony, your workhorse is here at SiriusXM.  Live programming when it matters.  This is not the day to be taken off.  That's all I want to say today. 
[00:48:00]  I die.  Would you like to lie to my beautiful moon?  I die.  You float among the stars together, you and I.  I'm scared.  But we can't lie.  Boo!  I die.  I die.  Up and away, my beautiful moon.  I die. 
[00:48:30]  I die.  I die.  I die.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:49:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:49:30]  Hey, man, a press release was just released.  Press release was just released.  All right, it kind of works.  I just tweeted this, but here it is.  Opie and Anthony show to offer exclusive Balloon Boy coverage.  Ah, look at this.  The Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM satellite radio is offering exclusive coverage of yesterday's Balloon Boy incident, 
[00:50:00]  including information only being covered by Opie and Anthony.  New York, New York, October 16, 2009.  Today, Opie and Anthony announced that on their Sirius XM satellite radio show,  they would be offering exclusive ongoing coverage of yesterday's Balloon Boy incident.  Opie and Anthony have taken ownership over the name Balloon Boy  and will be following and reporting on the story as no other broadcasted show is doing.  Opie and Anthony are granting their listeners unprecedented access into a story 
[00:50:30]  that only they are offering such coverage of.  Experts and media figures will be offering input into Opie and Anthony's team Balloon Boy news all morning long.  Opie and Anthony will be shifting from their traditional shock jock ways  to focus on straight facts and news that is only available from them.  Opie and Anthony can be heard live mornings in the United States and Canada  on Sirius XM from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. Eastern.  Every, and then it just ends. 
[00:51:00]  What the fuck?  We idiots.  Who are our experts?  Sam, Danny, E-Rock.  Our team of experts.  Our team of experts.  That's what it is.  Right.  Kent.  Yeah.  Kent, the movie guy.  Kent, the movie guy.  Cutting in with his paranormal fucking activity.  Review.  Enough about the fact you like movies.  Yeah.  Steve from Bayshore blowing the whole fucking secret thing.  And then I blew the secret thing by reading Stephen S.'s secret thing.  So Opie apparently is the secret blower. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, in the end I guess I am there.  Yeah.  And also I just want to put everybody on what?  On a...  Alert?  Notice?  On notice.  On notice, sure.  Anthony and I have trademarked the term Balloon Boy.  And if you use that fucking name, you're going to be hearing from our lawyers.  Make sure CNN knows that, Sam.  Okay.  No, for real.  Call them up and tell them.  Super Bowl and things like that.  Yeah, we have trademarked the term Balloon Boy. 
[00:52:00]  Okay.  If I see it on a fucking shirt or I see it on CNN in a graphic, there's going to be hell  to pay.  Okay.  That is ours.  I mean, if Gene Simmons could fucking trademark the money symbol, we could trademark Balloon  Boy.  And we have done just that.  All right?  Yeah.  All right.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I just can't.  These Japanese friggin' prank shows are the best.  Are how they don't kill people or just...  I guess there's no lawsuits in Japan. 
[00:52:30]  They haven't figured out...  Well, they don't have lawyers ruining everything.  Yeah.  So this is what used to happen in America before the lawyers got their grubby little fucking  hands into entertainment.  Well, they had candid cabra.  But they just take it way too far.  Yeah, they go way too fucking far.  I just saw the sniper attack one where the guys are sitting in a room and people just  that he's sitting with just start getting shot.  Yeah.  And he's freaking out trying to get out of the room, but the doors are locked. 
[00:53:00]  And they're just laughing at him from behind the scenes.  Hey, the boys down the hall, Sarah from Buffalo, she wouldn't prank me, I don't think.  She writes, Opie, Falcon just barfed on the Today Show live on the air and said,  Mom, I need a cup, and he vomited right on the air.  Meredith Vieira kept going.  No way.  Can we find out if that's true?  I must see this.  And is Meredith Vieira still wet from her fucking Who Wants to Be a Millionaire clip that we  all checked out online?  Her Navy guy.  She loves that Navy guy. 
[00:53:30]  All right, where do we go with our team coverage, Ed?  Those jabs are crazy.  And the one jab is getting shot in the back, and this is just a fun camera prank?  It's fun.  Look, they're all laughing at him, because he's cowering in complete fear for his life.  And they laugh at him.  And they're laughing at him.  He's crawling on the floor.  This is perfect for us, man.  They're horrible. 
[00:54:00]  I know he's trying to get out, and he can't, because the door's locked.  He's yelling, and they can't laugh hard enough at this poor guy who thinks he's going to  be shot.  Is this a TV show?  And then they're dragging him out.  Where can they find that, Danny?  If you just Google, like, Japanese sniper prank.  All right, Japanese sniper prank is the big one?  It's fantastic.  Japanese sniper prank.  Okay. 
[00:54:30]  Let's go back to the phone's end.  Joe in Tennessee.  Joe.  Joe.  Hey.  Yeah, you're completely missing the point.  The first thing I heard was it was an experimental balloon craft designed to get commuters to  work.  And I called Bravo Sierra right away.  This was just a prank for the father to get some publicity for his damn balloon.  Yeah, I think it's becoming very obvious now, finally.  I mean, Wolf Blitzer could have made it obvious a lot sooner.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's exactly what happened.  When I heard Wolf Blitzer, I mean, I couldn't believe he blew his chance to prove he wasn't 
[00:55:00]  an idiot like he was on Jeopardy.  Yeah.  They say that that balloon is supposed to be a mode of transportation.  No, come on.  I thought it was weather sensing equipment.  It's just a regular weather balloon.  I thought Dorothy was hanging from the bottom to release the little spheres out into the  tornado.  Hey, it's coming right this way.  It's already here.  Is it? 
[00:55:30]  Let's go to Scott.  Sarah's being backed up by Scott here.  Scott, what do you got?  Good evening.  Hey, buddy.  What happened, man?  Yeah.  So, Meredith is interviewing little Falcon and the family.  And it looks like it's four in the morning, wherever they were at.  And the little bastard puked right on the screen three times.  So, he's puking on the Today Show.  Falcon is, like, just folding under pressure.  He can't take it.  He can't handle the lie.  Do not handle the family lie.  He can't lie.  He's not good at it. 
[00:56:00]  He's just, he's honest to a fault.  He's puking his guts up thinking about it.  How did Meredith get the exclusive interview without you guys?  Well, you know, we gave her that one.  We gave her, we threw her a bone.  Because she's a horned up old lady.  All right, later, guys.  All right, thank you.  So, all right.  So, let's get back to this.  Yes.  So, then Wolf Blitzer, everyone had to call CNN and go, look, Wolf, the fucking kid just said, you know, you told us we were doing this for the show or whatever.  Yeah.  And finally, Wolf was told that's what the kid said. 
[00:56:30]  And then later on in his Situation Room broadcast, he went back to that.  Finally.  Now let's hear.  And you said to him, Falcon, why didn't you come out?  And Falcon said, hmm, you guys said that, hmm, we did this for the show.  And you said, hmm, what did he mean we did this for the show?  I had no idea.  I think he was talking about the media.  I've been asking him a lot of questions.  So, somebody had asked him that question earlier. 
[00:57:00]  You want to ask him now?  I don't know if he can hear me.  What he meant by what he said we did this for the show?  Yeah, let me interrupt this real quick because I think I can see the direction you guys are hedging on this.  Because earlier, you had asked the police officers the questions.  The media out front, we weren't even going to do this interview.  And I'm kind of appalled after all of the feelings that I went through, up and down, that you guys are trying to suggest something else. 
[00:57:30]  Okay?  I'm really appalled because they said out in front that this would be the end and I wouldn't have to be bothered for the rest of the week with any shows or anything.  So, we said, okay, fine, we'll do this.  So, I'm appalled that you guys would say something like that.  You know?  The guy's a horrible speaker. 
[00:58:00]  He's terrible.  He's a horrible speaker.  You can tell he's so flustered.  Right.  He is so flustered right there.  What did he mean?  Well, I think he meant the media, you know, because we did an interview before.  No, you say he did it for the show.  Right.  What are you talking about?  Well, fucking Wolf should be hitting him hard right now, right?  Yes.  Like, real hard.  Yay.  Well, instead, you got this last night.  No, no, we're not asking anything unusual.  You were asked earlier about if this was a publicity stunt. 
[00:58:30]  You say it wasn't.  The police say it wasn't.  The rescue operation say it wasn't.  The only thing I just wanted to clarify why Falcon had said earlier, we did this for the show, and I just wanted to clarify, I didn't understand what he was referring to.  Well, you know, we were on Y-Swap a couple of times, so the camera crews out there, I would imagine, they'd ask him a couple of questions in reference to this.  And I believe, you know, he meant something to do with that. 
[00:59:00]  Ah, no.  Right, and he's nodding his head for that.  I don't want you to misunderstand that.  Just asking the question doesn't mean, Richard, that we're suggesting anything on tour or anything like that.  We're just thrilled that Falcon is alive and well and your family is together.  We watched all of this play out during the course of several hours, and I have to tell you personally, as a reporter who reported that he was alive and well, it was a thrilling moment for me.  A thrilling moment that it was never a situation, really?  Fucking Wolf Blitzer, you suck. 
[00:59:30]  You really suck.  You have the father right in the corner when you need him, and you let him go.  You fucking back up.  You had him.  It's obvious this was a publicity stunt, a hoax.  The kid's puking on the Today Show, because he probably got yelled at for the last 16 hours.  When the fuck am I going to get to see that?  We're looking for it now.  We'll have the audio in seconds.  I have got to see that little bastard puking.  He just can't see.  I'm the questioning. 
[01:00:00]  Hey, little Falcon, you fucking rat.  You fucking whole family's fucking rats.  This is a lot of fun.  Let's say hi to David in Denver.  David.  Hey, fellas.  Did you see the balloon?  Did you see it in the sky?  No.  But Falcon sounds like Carl from Sling Blade as a youngster.  And the reason he was throwing up was probably because he didn't like the mustard on his biscuits yet. 
[01:00:30]  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Now, the poor little guy is probably so fucking...  He probably got such a talking to from his father.  Oh, yeah.  After that faux pas.  Well, remember you?  As a kid?  And now whenever he's on TV, I got a stomach ache.  He used to get stomach aches when your dad yelled at him.  Yes.  So, I mean, I'm thinking he got yelled at this little Falcon fucker.  Little Falcon.  And now his stomach is very nervous.  He's probably got a sour stomach.  Sour stomach.  His daddy made him tell a little fib.  Right.  His daddy made him fib. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  And then he made a mistake and disappointed his daddy.  So he got a belly ache.  Yeah.  And his daddy threw spaghetti against the wall and hit the phone.  And he called mommy a bitch.  You want to ask Nicole what she thinks about Balloon Boy?  Oh.  What is she doing?  Nicole from the morning mashup.  She's got no security with her.  Grab her.  Grab her.  She's got no security.  Grab her.  Where's your guys today?  Where's your guys?  Are they off?  No, they're in the other room.  Are you guys fighting?  They're prepping for a game that I'm not allowed to be in there for because it's about making fun of me. 
[01:01:30]  Oh.  It's a game about making fun of you?  Yeah.  It's called Nicole versus the streets.  And they ask me general knowledge questions that I should know the answers to.  And I never know the answers.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You guys prepare for your show.  It's so weird.  Yeah.  How is that?  We just wing it the whole time.  How does it work out?  I don't really prepare that much.  I mean, like, we have a general idea of what we might talk about and games we might play.  That's called prepared for us.  Yeah.  I hear you guys stay here until, like, 3 in the afternoon.  Yeah.  But we have a lot of other things that we do, you know?  We stay until about 10.  3 in the afternoon.  Yeah.  10. 
[01:02:00]  10.  10.  10.  I'm late at 10.  10.  Hook me up.  That's the life I want to live.  You'll get there.  You'll get there.  You're on your way.  It's very obvious.  I'm hoping.  We got scared because you walked down the hall by yourself today.  I know.  I felt really unsafe.  I felt, like, not protected.  And I'm a big black dude with me, you know?  Yeah.  You're like, you know, when Brittany used to walk around with a bodyguard and everything.  The big black bodyguard.  Remember him?  Yeah.  What's your take on Balloon Boy?  How are you guys handling it?  I can't freaking believe that kid.  I was genuinely watching yesterday and I was really upset.  And I was, I'm thinking this kid fell out. 
[01:02:30]  You know what?  His parents are idiots.  Have you heard about his parents?  That they were like, they were an alien.  They were on wife swap.  Yep.  I think they're lying sacks of shite.  And so is Little Falcon.  Little Falcon can't keep a lie.  He can't keep a lie, though.  Right.  Like, how do you, like, reprimand him?  We had CNN and the whole world worried about you and you were just hiding up in the attic?  He blurted out that he, uh, he said that his father said that we were doing it for the show. 
[01:03:00]  For the show.  So, the kid, like, yeah.  And now, apparently, he just vomited on the Today Show.  On the Today Show in front of Meredith Vieira.  Because he was nervous?  A little kid, yes.  He's got a sour stomach.  He's puking like crazy.  I know, I've just got to see the little feller just puking.  It's going to be adorable.  He should be puking.  He should feel bad.  He should feel bad.  Asshole.  Family of lying rats.  Well, I have to go back and get made fun of now.  Okay. 
[01:03:30]  Have fun.  But it was lovely seeing you guys, as always.  It's very good seeing you, um, without your security team.  Yes, well, thank you.  Have a good weekend, guys.  You too.  Thanks, Nicole, for the morning mashup.  Now, let's watch her leave.  Don't make her feel old.  I will just watch her leave.  There she goes.  Wow.  They're behind the story, huh?  That's why you need us.  If she was wandering around, do you think you'd give a shit about balloon boys?  No.  Fucking balloon sweater.  She's got two balloon boys in her sweater. 
[01:04:00]  Two balloon boys.  That's what I'm looking at.  Waiting for those fuckers to land.  Well, she's got youth on her side, so they're not landing anytime soon.  No, they're up there for the duration.  At least another decade, those balloons will be in the air.  Damn it.  Hey, it's sad, though.  They're way behind the story.  Yeah.  She still thinks that, you know, the kid...  The kid was up there, I think, or was hiding in the attic.  She doesn't understand that the father, you know, made this whole thing up. 
[01:04:30]  Put him up to it.  Well, they prep for the show.  They can't, like, just spend time on stupid balloon boy like we do.  What do you got?  The kid puking?  Oh, fuck.  Here it is.  I want to see it at some point.  We're going to see it.  Yeah.  We've got to do it for the radio audience, and we'll fucking get the video.  But here's balloon boy on the Today Show a mere few minutes ago.  Somebody had asked him if they could show, and he would show them, how he got in the attic.  So he was obliging them.  And one of the guys told him it was for some TV show. 
[01:05:00]  So that's what he was referring to.  That's what he was referring to when he made that statement.  And I know I want to point out that the sheriff's office said last night that...  Another fucking asshole on the news.  Why don't they acknowledge what is happening in front of their eyes ever?  That was a great puke.  How do you not acknowledge that little falcon puking? 
[01:05:30]  Young Bob Kelly.  Right.  She just goes on with the next fucking question.  I have to hear him puking again.  He made that statement.  And I know I...  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I've got to go backwards a little bit here.  Oh, that's fucking great.  Blech.  Huge puke, and she doesn't even acknowledge it.  So that's what he was referring to.  That's what he was referring to when...  He made that statement. 
[01:06:00]  I was laughing.  And I know I want to point out that the sheriff's office said last night that they believe  your account of what happened, but they do want to question you a little bit more today,  Richard, as well.  And I'm sure some of the questions will be hard for you to deal with.  So let me just ask you right now, just put it out there and get your honest answer.  Was this a hoax or a publicity stunt?  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  And now I'm starting to get a little ticked off because I'm repetitively getting asked this. 
[01:06:30]  And what have I got the gain out of this?  Wow.  And you know what?  The kid is puking because he got it talking to last night.  Come on.  Yeah.  Because he could still come out of this, believe it or not.  How?  By getting all mad and stuff and going, look, it wasn't...  You know, he said that because he's a little six-year-old.  He doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.  I'm just watching some of the video here.  You got the video?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Balloon Boy Throws Up on YouTube.  And he's covering his mouth. 
[01:07:00]  There you go.  The way they're sitting on the couch is one parent's on each end and the three kids are  in the middle.  Yeah.  Falcon is leaning on his father.  Turns.  He says, I need a cup.  I'm going to throw up.  He turns over his brother and starts to throw up on his brother when they throw a little  Tupperware container under him.  Look at him.  They put a little Tupperware in front of him.  And then the mother's wife...  Oh, my God.  But look at his brother next to him, the face that the kid has because he's throwing up 
[01:07:30]  on top of him.  And then Meredith doesn't even bring up the fact, hey, your kid's puking.  I would so bang Meredith Vieira.  Especially after that fucking Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  Oh, fucking cougar.  I would so fucking do that.  That cougar.  Why?  Right up.  Fucking Falcon puking.  Fucking menopause.  You want to hear it again?  Yeah.  All right.  Somebody had asked him if they could show, he would show them how he got in the attic. 
[01:08:00]  So he was obliging them.  And one of the guys told him it was for some...  Mom, you need to go.  One of the guys told him it was for some TV show.  So that's what he was referring to.  That's what he was referring to when he made that statement.  I hear some laughing in the background.  Yeah, people are laughing.  Some of the crew is laughing.  Because those are the real people.  Yeah.  Not the newsreaders.  No, the people behind the scenes.  They have to be robots, but the people behind the scenes, those are the real people. 
[01:08:30]  Of course you're going to laugh.  Of course you're going to learn the equipment.  You made that statement.  And I know I want to point out that the sheriff's office said last night that they believe your account of what happened.  But they do want to question you a little bit more today, Richard, as well.  And I'm sure some of the questions will be hard for you to deal with.  So let me just ask you right now.  Just put it out there and get your honest answer.  Was this a hoax or a publicity stunt?  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not. 
[01:09:00]  And now I'm starting to get a little ticked off because I'm repetitively getting asked this.  And what have I got the gain out of this?  Publicity.  That's why it's called a publicity stunt.  You get publicity from it.  The poor little kid is just fucking dry heaving in the background.  That's just great.  That's just great.  Part of the audio that I didn't give you is the father's still going on and on trying to defend his explanation and how things are going to be sorted out. 
[01:09:30]  Totally ignoring that the kid's thrown up.  He's still focused on the camera.  And Meredith is trying to get into, when he's pausing, trying to break in there and say, look, your kid's sick.  Let's take a break.  Yeah.  The guy's still talking.  So finally she goes, okay.  It's like she's kind of annoyed now because he's just ignoring the fact that the kid's thrown up.  Yeah, he's ignoring the kid.  He just, you know, maybe you should take care of your fucking kids.  So she forces them to go to break and I guess they'll deal with him a little later.  But a little kid.  A little kid.  I don't think this kid's going to survive the day. 
[01:10:00]  He's had a rough 24 hours.  Father wants him in on a huge hoax.  Jay still wants the kid brought in for the eggnog challenge.  Maybe he could throw up on this show.  Is a must listen today.  So we got Balloon Boy, right?  Yeah.  Now I'm getting some intel from a lot of people.  Yeah.  That your ex just talked about your cheating ways with an expert on Channel 11.  No way.  So we got to go find that audio too.  Oh, shit. 
[01:10:30]  Yikes.  With an expert?  With an expert.  Kind of an expert.  This is the show to listen to, man, today.  Oh, my God.  We got way too much going on.  Where is it?  It's everywhere.  Jill was just discussing.  Where is it?  Thank you, Phil and Brooklyn.  Jill was just discussing Anthony.  Didn't mention him by name.  Cheating ways on the WB-11 with a relationship expert.  Oh, uh-oh. 
[01:11:00]  You.  So we'll get that audio.  We got to get that one.  Yeah.  I don't think anyone's going anywhere today.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Let me say hi to Steve in Pennsylvania.  Steve.  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  Good, Steve.  Hello.  Hello.  Steve.  Come on.  Listen to the fucking show.  Yeah, that's behind, man.  Listen to the goddamn phone call.  We got a dumb delay.  Let's go.  Hey, sorry.  Hey, on that YouTube video, I don't know how much they show after the kid pukes, but you  got to check it out. 
[01:11:30]  The guy's face after the kid pukes, it's total disgust.  Yeah, yeah.  He makes a disgusted face and then he continues talking.  Yeah, I was waiting for that guy to puke on his son.  That was going to be hilarious.  His son looks like that.  You know what, Ed?  Poor kid.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  Eventually, people will understand.  We're seers.  We're seers.  That kid looks fucking drugged up like the dentist kid now.  Oh, man.  Just like we said this morning.  Because he doesn't want that kid saying anything stupid today.  And he's probably puking for the drugs that he gave him last night. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, God.  Just my...  I mean, I don't know for sure, obviously.  The father's disgusted.  This story just gets better and better.  Now he's puke boy.  But we're the only fucking media outlet and we're loosely based in the media.  We're telling you like it is.  Yes.  This whole thing's a hoax.  The son is in a major panic.  He's got a sour stomach because whatever the father said to him last night, like, you shut  your fucking mouth when we do all these interviews tomorrow. 
[01:12:30]  He probably got no sleep.  He's all worried.  Yeah.  I...  You can't say that you think the father drugged his son, but I bet you his father made him  stay up all night or something.  Yeah, yeah.  And made him eat a lot of cookies and milk and shit and ice cream.  Yeah, it looks like his breath fixed came up.  You can see the brother's disgusted.  He threw up on his brother's hands and some on his pants there.  Oh, yeah.  Look at his brother's trying to wipe his hand off.  This is great.  This family is fucked.  Come on. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Mike in Massachusetts.  Mike.  Top of the morning.  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What's up, man?  Hey.  A little earlier.  A half hour ago, Ant called Ope the secret blower, and Ope was like, oh, I guess I am.  There you go.  Yeah, yeah, the secret blower.  There it is, yeah.  Also, I figured out why Ant likes Patrice.  Patrice's name is Pat O'Neill.  That's not black at all.  Should have quit while you were waiting. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  Too late.  Anthony, this is great.  You know, we are your exclusive Bloom Boy station.  Bloom Boy, yeah.  And finally, we got Little Falcon calling in.  Little Falcon.  Hello.  Hi, Little Falcon.  How are you?  I'm actually wonderful.  Are you feeling okay today?  No.  What's wrong?  I wanted to straighten out.  Yeah.  I was throwing up, but I was up in the attic with my Uncle Paul.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:14:00]  It did look a little creamy coming out of your mouth.  He was talking about swallowing and some kind of seed.  Oh, God damn it.  All right, you little bastard.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  There he goes.  Bye-bye.  Let me say hi to Andy in Indiana.  Andy.  Dude, you know that dad fed that little fucker some syrup of EpiCac this morning, but right  before that TV show to keep his fucking mouth shut. 
[01:14:30]  So whenever he tried to talk, he'd puke.  Yeah, there's something going on.  Daddy said it was for the bleh.  Why is Falcon puking on the Today Show this morning?  Why don't you question that?  They told me to hide it in bleh.  Right.  I was never in the bleh.  Daddy said the show was the bleh.  Well, if you want to do the bit, we can do the bit.  Hold on a minute here.  I've got to find something. 
[01:15:00]  The poor little kid.  You're going to start seeing now these reporters and stuff, reporters, newsreaders, feeling  sorry for the child now and really laying into this guy.  Because the kid's now puking on the Today Show, and the father is getting all belligerent  that people are calling him out for this being a hoax.  But he's not taking care of his kid.  He should have been like, hey, hey, hey, this interview's over. 
[01:15:30]  I've got to take care of my boy.  Right.  Take care of my boy.  My boy.  Poor little guy.  Poor little feller.  Puking his guts up.  He must have ate some bad potted meat.  I can't find the fucking puking sound effect.  You did the boy.  You should know to puke like that.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Yes.  Let me say hi to, let's go to Hammer in Jersey.  Hammer.  Hammer. 
[01:16:00]  Good evening.  What's up, Hammer?  Hey, am I the only one that wishes this fucking Falcon was dead?  Jesus.  I don't wish, I don't like the father too much right now.  I think it was the black kid that stole the balloon too.  What?  I don't know.  All right, here we go.  Now we're ready.  I was told to go to the other.  Daddy said it's for the. 
[01:16:30]  Daddy knew I wasn't in the.  It's a.  It's a.  It's a.  It's a.  It's a.  It's a. 
[01:17:00]  Poor little fucker is throwing up on national television.  Are they showing it here?  Yeah, it's everywhere now.  Now they're showing that interview?  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  And now Meredith Vieira disappoints.  There's something going on.  You got to hit this father with some hard questions now.  Jody, what's going on?  Hey, I figure he's throwing up because his dad told him it's because of you that I'm going to go to jail. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, yeah, the dad probably gave him, gave him some shit.  Oh, my God.  Either way, the kid got some shit.  Guilted the father, guilted the kid.  You know, you got daddy in big, big trouble.  Yeah.  I didn't want.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Yeah, right.  There's not a fucking cell in my body that thinks this was real.  No.  You know.  Total fake now.  Yeah, that's that's definitely what I'm.  Fake, fake, totally fake.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Mike in Syracuse. 
[01:18:00]  Mike.  Yeah, boy.  Yeah.  So I was that close to Meredith, dear.  I think my little guy would be throwing up, too.  Cougar all the way.  Right.  Not a fan of the cougar.  Come on, Ann.  You would, right?  Nein.  Why not?  Nein.  Why not?  Because she's dumb.  Ew.  Right up.  A kid.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Kevin and PA.  Kevin.  Hey.  Hey.  You guys are missing the fact that this kid started throwing up. 
[01:18:30]  Ray's the father was telling the lie.  So there's got to be something seriously psychological with this kid.  Oh, right.  Yes.  There we go.  He started throwing up right when the father told the bullshit story.  Right.  Yeah.  You don't rat out your father.  I don't understand.  He's calling the little kid Fredo.  Yeah.  I don't understand the mainstream media, though.  They're kind of like circling, kind of, but they're not brave enough to go in for the  kill.  Yeah.  Why are they giving this guy, like, the benefit of the doubt? 
[01:19:00]  Why does it take us to tell everybody how it is?  For real.  Because we're fucking magical.  But why?  Is anybody really pushing this?  Yeah.  Not really.  They're kind of circling.  Yeah.  But they're not brave enough to accuse the father of making this whole thing up.  Well, the facts are right in front of your face.  I'm getting a little ticked off now.  Oh, are you?  Right.  Maybe you should wipe your kid's fucking mouth because he's puking at your lies.  Right.  Exactly.  Let me say hi to Jason in Carolina.  Jason.  Hey, man. 
[01:19:30]  I think everybody's missing the point, too.  Yesterday, this kid was supposedly dead.  And today, the dad's pissed off at him and ignoring him while he's puking.  Like, everything's back to normal for this family.  Yeah, yeah.  Yesterday, less than 24 hours ago, this guy potentially thought his son was going to plummet  to his death from some contraption he built.  And then today, instead of just, hey, we want to spend time with our family, it's just a miracle  that we're together and that he didn't get hurt. 
[01:20:00]  He's chastising the media for calling him a liar as his kid throws up next to him.  And, all right, let's say...  You're right.  I can't even say it that way.  It's a hoax.  So he had to make the media believe that this really happened.  Yep.  But now today, yeah, he's not concerned over his kid that he thought yesterday was in  a balloon.  If you thought your kid was potentially dead or going to die, wouldn't you spend more  than just a few hours?  Right. 
[01:20:30]  Maybe holding him and saying, oh, my God, this is fantastic that we have you here.  Because if we're supposed to buy the story that he told yesterday, then obviously he's  puking because of what he went through yesterday.  Yeah.  Right.  It's perfect.  It's perfect.  But no one will fucking...  You know what they should do?  Pieces together.  They should get one of those lying experts.  They do it from time to time.  And they slow down the fucking clip and they look at the body language and whatnot. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  That's what...  If a station was brave enough, that's what they should do.  Yeah.  And that's a way to really, you know, go in for the kill.  Yeah.  You know, get an expert that knows that shit.  Analyze this guy's bullshit.  Right.  Bill in New York.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, man.  Listen, they caught the kid with some suspect shit on Channel 2 this morning.  One of the brothers said that he was videotaping the little falcon climbing into the stupid  balloon.  Right.  And he said once he saw that, he turned off the camera and ran and got his parents. 
[01:21:30]  But then they got video of the parents reacting like the dad, like, kicking a fucking piece  of wood around the yard, screaming at the balloon.  So you're telling me the little brother comes back, turns on the fucking camera and starts  taping the guy again?  Right.  Yeah.  No, of course not.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is such fucking bullshit.  Anthony and our spies are out there.  Yes.  Andreas, it looks like.  CNN is using the trademarked term balloon boy on their website.  Oh, shit.  Will they be hearing from our lawyers today?  C&D.  Send it out immediately. 
[01:22:00]  We trademarked balloon boy.  We own that.  I want to cease and desist immediately.  Uh, let me say hi to Brian in Carolina.  Brian.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Brian.  Listen, you guys, the today's show video, right after he gets done puking, the father  keeps explaining why it isn't a publicity stunt.  If you guys can play that video longer, he says why it's not a publicity stunt.  They show horribly such a jackass.  He actually gives like six reasons as to why he would do it. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, shit.  Really?  See if you can play it longer.  All right.  So we got to get the clip and go a little longer.  If the boys are listening down the hall, could you get that for us?  Thank you.  Thanks, Brian.  Jamie, what's up?  Hello?  Hi, Jamie.  Hey.  Hey, there.  We have an entire...  You didn't get the whole clip.  The entire family is just throwing their guts up at this point.  Stop.  That's from the big sale of Lois.  Yeah, right on, Jamie. 
[01:23:00]  Look at Jamie doing a little radio from her cell phone.  Family guy.  Good job.  The family guy clip where everyone's puking.  That's funny.  Let's go to Steve in Wyoming.  Steve.  Hey, yes.  Hey, I've got a question.  What about if the kids were trying to get over the wall like in East Berlin? 
[01:23:30]  They were just building the balloon to get over the wall.  Wow.  How about building a balloon to get over the crater?  That bomb just left.  Holy shit.  All right.  We're going to have that fucking drudge report is also using the term balloon boy.  Oh, fuck.  Matt Drudge, pull that.  You better pull that.  We trademarked balloon boy.  It's ours.  Get the word out.  We mean business with that one today. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Jimmy is playing the Funny Bone at Virginia Beach tonight.  He played last night as well.  And he was bitching and complaining about that prop plane he had to take.  Yeah.  He had to take a prop plane.  He doesn't like those at all.  No.  I don't think he's taken one in years.  He usually flies first class on large, wide-body aircraft.  And he had to take a little turboprop plane in some pretty inclement weather, I believe.  And I guess he's talking about that. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  He left us all a voicemail.  Let's take a listen to this.  Hey, it's Jim.  We landed in Virginia Beach.  And we have Patrice O'Neill who's in the studio today.  And he was saying that when he flies, he wants to have like an old white man.  And we all wholeheartedly agreed.  And we got on the plane.  Our pilot is a young black gentleman.  And it was a very, very smooth flight.  We had a worry, too, because it was a prop plane.  And it's raining, cloudy the whole way. 
[01:25:00]  And it was one of the smoothest flights I've ever had.  But before he warned us, he said it might be choppy.  Or as he phrased it, I was supposed to be bumpy as a motherfucker.  But it turned out to be a good flight.  So I'm here in Virginia.  And for those of you in New Jersey, tomorrow morning, Friday morning, my Stress Factory tickets are on sale.  The night before Thanksgiving, I'm just doing two shows that night only, Wednesday the 25th,  where I brutally fuck a turkey on stage.  A live turkey.  I face-fuck it.  And I wave at the crowd. 
[01:25:30]  We all tell little Thanksgiving stories.  See, it was uneventful.  He had a fine flight.  In the end, there was no reason to worry.  All right.  We can do a twofer from Jim.  We got the Ted phone sex hotline, too, as we go to break here.  This is pretty damn funny from earlier in the week.  So check this out, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  Are you looking for some hard, hot action?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I have a big one, Heather.  Oh, let me swallow that fucking dick down my throat. 
[01:26:00]  I'm going to put it in you.  Oh, yeah.  And just give it to you until you're dead.  Are you looking to get turned on like a light bulb?  Oh, my pussy is so wet.  It's dripping now.  I want you to be so wet that it looks like a lake down there.  Oh, my God.  The Ted Sheckler Verbal Intercourse Emporium will connect you one-on-one for a private  party with the man himself.  I'm going to spank you, madam.  You've been very bad.  You killed an old lady with a hammer, and I'm going to spank you. 
[01:26:30]  Spank it hard.  It's the wildest all-live action with one hot, developmentally-disabled entrepreneur with  a mustache.  I'm going to lick the little man on the boat until my tongue is chapped and dry and  smelled.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my quick little phone.  I'm going to come see him.  That's right, madam.  I'm going to make you come so hard that people are like, hey, there's a Niagara Falls and  that lady's underpants.  You're in for one meaty overture.  Yeah, I'm going to lick it on your face. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, sweet lady.  I want you to come so hard that your cancer would fall off.  Oh, my God.  Rub it quicker.  Rub it so fast that people think it's wiping.  Just go back, relax, and whip it out.  So you're coming like nobody's business.  It's the Ted Sheckler Verbal Intercourse Emporium. 
[01:27:30]  We got the Iron Sheik coming in.  Nice.  He hasn't been on since he peed his pants.  Should be good.  And a wrestler he's fighting with, even though he doesn't wrestle anymore, this Iron Sheik,  he can barely walk down the hall, but he's still, like, talking a good game.  What is he?  Yeah, what is he doing?  There's a wrestler called Brian Blair that Iron Sheik hates.  Never heard of him, sir.  And Brian Blair has a video where he accuses the Iron Sheik. 
[01:28:00]  What happened?  It's not right.  No, it's not warm.  Bagels toasted.  The turkey's cold.  Everything's supposed to be warm.  Fuck, my man.  Yeah, it's not a turkey's fucking sandwich.  Is it supposed to all be grilled and stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, like, see, the turkey is supposed to be heated with the cheese melted on it.  Ah, nice.  And then the bagel toasted, and then the delicate operation of putting the heated turkey and melted cheese on the toasted bagel. 
[01:28:30]  That sounds like it would be a good Sambo.  So, redo.  I need a redo.  Call for a redo.  Fuck.  I used to wait a little bit.  Chris, redo.  Thumbs up.  I don't care.  I'm just going to eat the fucking thing on the air.  No, he's running.  All right.  Well, I made him run.  No, he's running.  Where is he running?  I don't know.  He's, uh, Kenny's assistant. 
[01:29:00]  He's, Kenny's replacement.  But does he know what the redo is for?  I think he just heard you.  Or am I going to get an exact same fucking...  He had that thing in his ear, so I think he just heard what you need.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  If he could still hear, everything has to be cooked, basically.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We'll do a short break so you can eat, Ant.  Ah, hoo-hoo, my bagel's wrong, Robin.  Yeah, I know.  That was my baked potato.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  So, Brian Blair made a video basically claiming that Iron Sheik smoked crack with some kind 
[01:29:30]  of boy, or he smoked a crack and then molested a boy.  What?  Yeah.  Those are some fucking heavy-duty allegations.  Is that what we're going to hear, Sam?  We have an expert, Sam, just walked into the studio.  Now, we're breaking away from our Balloon Boy coverage for a minute, but we're going to  go right back to it, Sam.  Just for a moment.  We don't want these people leaving us today.  No.  What's the story with the Iron Sheik and this Brian Blair?  Well, the Iron Sheik and Brian Blair, they've had a rivalry since WrestleMania III. 
[01:30:00]  Keep in mind, we're approaching WrestleMania XXVI.  So, holy shit.  Yeah.  And they're still going at it, even though no one cares in the whole world.  The Iron Sheik...  That's a while ago.  Yeah.  Now, Brian Blair recently did a shoot interview, which is where the old wrestlers sit down  and they tell, like, the real story.  You know, they just sit down and do an interview out of character.  A shoot interview?  Yeah, this is a shoot.  A shoot is like when it's real.  Like, oh, you're shooting right now.  It means you're speaking like real.  Like, I'm not in character. 
[01:30:30]  I'm being for real.  Wow.  Yeah.  And so, they asked him about the Iron Sheik, and he said, the Iron Sheik smoked crack on  a plane and molested a boy.  Again, I'll say, those are some heavy-duty allegations.  And this is what Brian Blair is saying.  We have no fucking idea.  My God.  But we'll certainly ask the Iron Sheik about it.  Well, we certainly will.  And I'm sure he'll deny it and call that man an idiot.  Maybe he won't, though.  Maybe.  Yes.  Yes.  You have caught me.  It was a great time. 
[01:31:00]  I would smoke the crack and molest the boy.  I was making a wee-wees.  We got part of the video right here.  As the years went on, Cosgro would not stop.  I mean, the drugs, the steroids, the workouts.  And then I found out that I could not believe that he had a young boy, a ring boy, in the  room, a guy that wanted to be in the ring crew or something.  And I hear this.  At first, I smelled pot in the hallway. 
[01:31:30]  And I'm smelling this pot that leads me to the door.  And I'm listening.  And I hear the Sheik's voice.  And I hear this, like a lower tone voice.  And Sheik molested this little kid in the room.  Jesus.  That is like, you cannot just make allegations like that.  There was no I think. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Flat out, Sheik molested the little ring boy.  So now, what repercussions were there for this gentleman saying this about the Sheik?  I don't know.  He just said it recently.  So the Sheik has not responded to this?  Not in such a public form as the O.P. and Anthony.  Oh, sweet.  So now we will get the inside scoop.  Correct.  On the Sheik and how we will respond to these allegations of child molestation.  Correct.  And drug use.  Yes.  Holy mother of God, this show is just breaking news. 
[01:32:30]  That's right.  I'll put out another press release.  Yeah, you should.  Put out another press release like our balloon boy one.  Kevin from Connecticut writes, did this happen in Gurney?  Do we know if it happened in Gurney?  Oh, maybe not in Gurney in a limo.  Was it powdered cocaine or crack cocaine or both?  Who needed the crack cocaine?  Iron Sheik, crack cocaine for him.  Yeah.  And powdered cocaine for the little boy, right?  That's correct.  Here's more from Brian Blair.  Sheik's turned into a, he's one of the guys that I will tell you that I think is not a good person. 
[01:33:00]  And not only did, I remember the first time when we were going to Australia, Sheik had popcorn.  Cut hole in the bottom of the box.  Put his weenie through.  And all of a sudden I smelled something funny and they had crack rocks at the bottom of this popcorn.  Him and a deceased friend, good friend, junkyard dog. 
[01:33:30]  Oh.  Bless him.  And here these guys are smoking crack.  I can't believe this.  I mean, I really can't believe this.  How is the Iron Sheik not dead?  With all the crack smoking.  Because I think he obviously keeps his body healthy.  Yeah, right.  Oh, obviously.  He must be able to German back spear.  Incontinence.  Is a fantastic thing for health.  Great.  You're just a little boy. 
[01:34:00]  You should not have heard things like this.  Greatest country in the world.  Well, we'll ask the Iron Sheik about this.  He's a Hall of Famer.  Yeah, I know.  I'm working at Bill Cox's outfit with the young boy living garage.  Can't wait for him to come in.  Good.  And don't forget, one of the bushwhackers and demolition are coming with him. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Now, which one of the bushwhackers?  Luke.  Do the bushwhacker walk.  Sam's going to do it for everybody.  Yeah.  Yes.  That's how they did it.  I remember that.  They'd swing their fists up and down.  Let's just make him do it the whole time he's here.  And don't forget, they would lick each other's heads.  Yes.  Yeah, the bushwhackers.  Their heads.  And you're a big wrestling fan.  I'm going to have the bushwhacker lick you.  I wish you wouldn't.  No, we've got to get that done for you because I know you're a big fan.  That would be a nice memory for you. 
[01:35:00]  I want a lot of different people.  Hear me now.  And maybe some of the callers could do it, too, even though it's radio.  And just keep requesting that the bushwhacker does his patented walk.  I want to see how many times we can get the guy to do it.  To do his stupid walk.  Even after he does it, just keep requesting.  Well, you've got to kind of work it in smoothly, Sam.  Hey, can you do that walk one more time?  Yeah, and Nick believe we didn't see it or whatever.  I'm older than that.  How many do you think we could get?  I say we get him to do it seven times.  Seven?  Yeah.  I was going to say three. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  So seven's the over-under?  Right.  All right, back to Balloon Boy.  Thank you, Sam.  Of course.  Let us know when the Iron Sheik is here.  So someone, and I want to thank the listeners today because they're all over the place for us.  And they're giving us the heads up on everything that's happened with the Balloon Boy.  Oh, all this breaking news today.  Yeah, they turned us on to the puking clip.  Thank you for that.  And then someone else called up and said, if you continue with the puking clip, the father is just humming a, humming a, humming a again.  And they're still not calling him out on the fact that this looks like it was definitely a hoax or a publicity stunt, whatever you want to say. 
[01:36:00]  Come on already.  Here it is.  And I'm not selling anything.  I'm not advertising anything.  My family and I, we do this all the time.  You know, we're always doing some kind of scientific research.  We're always building something together.  I teach my kids how to shoot cameras.  You know, it's highly educational for my boys.  So, no, I mean, absolutely not.  This is not some kind of hoax.  You know, Richard, we want to talk about what happened yesterday.  And I know that your son, Falcon, thank goodness he is okay, but he's not feeling well this morning. 
[01:36:30]  And I know that just a few moments ago he got ill.  So, let's take a break here so the family can gather itself.  And we'll be right back and we'll talk to you a little bit more about what you went through yesterday with thinking that your son was missing.  Okay?  Okay.  All right, we'll be right back.  The news shows how awful they are when these big stories hit.  Yeah.  They just show how awful they really are. 
[01:37:00]  They have nothing.  They have absolutely nothing on this.  And they should just be fucking, like, nailing this guy to the wall.  I think he works for CNN now.  Jack Cafferty, give him some fucking live air time right now.  He'll beat up the folder.  This guy, he'll lay into him.  He'll lay into him.  I think he's pretty much the only one that would lay into him.  Maybe Bill O'Reilly would, right?  Well, Geraldo is talking on Fox, and I don't know what Geraldo is doing.  Well, can we get the Geraldo clips?  Because he's always good for a soundbiter, too. 
[01:37:30]  Might.  I want to see if he believes it or not.  Believe it or not.  Right.  Hmm.  Anthony, your ex.  Ah.  This was brought to our attention.  Yes.  Once again, the listeners are everywhere for us.  What happened?  Well, I guess there was some kind of relationship expert on the air.  Oh, goody.  And Jill wasn't in on the story.  Oh, I don't know.  I see them talking about something now.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that scary?  I don't know what it is.  I don't know what the fuck they're doing.  Oh, those chicks are talking. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Can't be any good.  Can't be good.  I think they're talking about their periods.  Probably.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  Hers is a heavy flow.  You can tell.  Yeah, yeah.  And then she leaned over and touched Jill like, it's okay.  It's okay.  I get heavy flows, too.  Heavy flows.  And look, now they go to the woman on the street.  Well, we asked a lot of women today about their heavy flows.  Yes.  And here's a montage of them talking about their heavy flows. 
[01:38:30]  Why do you think they showed the big fat bellies?  Oh, yeah.  They're bloated a little bit.  They're bloated because they're about to release their heavy flows.  Their fucking womb blood.  Honestly, just turn down the sound and you'll see it for yourself.  Yeah.  You know, when you see a bunch of women readers, they're just talking about their heavy flows.  Just talking about the heavy flows.  You can have fun at home.  We just did.  So Jill's not even in the story.  It's like some kind of relationship expert. 
[01:39:00]  And then they said that, like, a lot of women like to have burn parties after their ex does them wrong.  And then Jill's like, well, I can tell you a little something about burn parties.  Well, let me step in and talk about this, I guess.  And this is how it went down as Jill was talking about her ex who was sitting right next to me in the fine opium anthony studio.  Yes, that'd be me.  The other thing that was just really good is if you're going to be pining over someone, put it away, put it in an attic, put it in storage, or just all together, have, like, one of those burn parties. 
[01:39:30]  Just burn it full.  What the heck?  That sounds kind of angry.  What's a burn party?  I have friends that literally have had bonfires over breakups.  There's a divorce party.  Yeah.  You know, my husband always says, I'm the expert at burning.  Yes, you are.  We're getting together very soon.  I see a video of Jill putting things in a pit, and then burn it, and then video it.  This is like our girl's circle right now.  That is so true.  I have burnt clothes, and I'm female.  That doesn't sound like you.  I caught my ex cheating, so I burnt all of her things in the fire, in his new fire pit. 
[01:40:00]  It was good.  And I don't mean to do a little inside training, but you also found somebody in a closet.  Yeah, so it was a little disturbing.  We need to talk about that, by the way.  I don't regret it.  I think that was wonderful.  And that's where the clip ends.  Oh, come on.  Another opportunity blown.  That's like fucking...  You continue talking about that.  That's a story.  Oh, my God.  And we got a little more info today.  Whoops.  There's a videotape of it.  I guess there's a video of her...  Because it sounds like she showed the videotape to her coworkers on Channel 11. 
[01:40:30]  Of her burning the stuff.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, I need to see that video.  Definitely need to see that video.  You think maybe she could just kind of, I don't know,  send an email to one of us around here.  I don't know.  I wish...  Would you like to see that, Ant?  I wish the video got out much like the recent nude picture of her got out that she was sending  to her boyfriend.  Really?  Is it a new one?  Whoopsie.  She's doing some of that sexting? 
[01:41:00]  I guess so.  And apparently, that guy put it on the internet.  Right.  You know.  Because it made it to the internet.  Wow.  Okay.  Oops.  Oops.  Can we see that picture?  Yeah, we're going to see that picture.  Where is that one?  Dude, we got to see that video.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to see the video.  I want to see, like, if she's saying stuff.  Because that would be...  The audio would be great.  Because I'm sure she's burning the stuff and then saying, like, well, you know, is it a 
[01:41:30]  narrated piece?  Uh-huh.  Is she going, oh, look, I'm burning stuff.  This is because I...  Why is it covered?  Because somebody was trying to sell it to somebody else.  So they put a black bar over it.  I've seen the one, though, without the black bar.  Yeah, there she is.  Property of Walker Media.  Somebody was trying to sell this to our good friends at Tyler Durden.  What would Tyler Durden do?  Oh, really? 
[01:42:00]  No.  They weren't buying.  They weren't buying.  Actually, he had contacted me to ask for validation to see, is this actually this person?  I can validate.  You've seen that before.  That would be her.  Really?  Taking little naked pictures in the mirror.  That's all right.  Let's go to Diana.  Diana.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I don't know if you guys even have this part.  I was just walking. 
[01:42:30]  Right after she was talking about burning his clothes and stuff, she flipped her lighter.  Oh, really?  Like a freaking psychopath on there.  I'm like, she's really not showing her lighter.  But it's the second time she's actually made a shot this week.  She was on with Mick Foley.  And she thanked him for, oh, by the way, thanks for setting us up.  Because he cheated on me horribly.  And it ended with a girl in a closet.  Obviously, she's been reminiscing all week.  Yeah.  We want to see the video. 
[01:43:00]  I definitely want to see the video.  I know.  I just heard there's a video now.  And this is going to be my project.  Holy shit, everyone wants to see the video of her burning the clothes in the fire pit.  It's a legal video.  Yeah.  Come on.  There you go.  You can have that big TV downstairs.  You can just show that on there.  Wow.  Yeah.  Please somehow get us the video.  We want to check that out.  Damn, yo.  Yeah.  She won't get in trouble.  And you don't care at this point, right?  I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  All right.  Exactly.  Peace out, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mike in Indiana. 
[01:43:30]  Mike.  Mike.  Hi, guys.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, Mike.  That first clip he played, Jill sounds like a lesbian.  She says, I caught my ex cheating, so I burnt all her clothes.  All right.  Oh, all her clothes.  Yeah.  Right.  Oops.  Very good.  See ya.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  That's a closet.  My God, it seems like just yesterday.  Well, Larry King wants to talk about the closet.  Larry.  Anthony, question. 
[01:44:00]  Yes, Larry.  You had the girl in the closet.  What did you do with the groceries?  Let me go to Lydia in Oceanside.  The Lydia.  Lydia.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Lydia.  So, Anthony, you got a chat with me the other day when I said that some of your ex-girlfriends  were PLSs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look what this one's doing. 
[01:44:30]  Case in point.  Well, what?  She's a woman scorned.  So, you know, she...  I don't think she's a piece of shit because she got upset with finding a naked girl in a closet  at Anthony's.  Perhaps I could have handled things differently.  Perhaps I could have handled things differently.  Right.  Well, that's certainly true, Andy.  You know.  I hope you could find some classy ladies who have careers of their own.  You don't have to borrow yours for fame.  Well, well...  She was.  She has a career.  She has a very good career.  I mean... 
[01:45:00]  It went that route and he didn't like it.  He at least tried it out.  Yeah.  She, you know, wasn't...  It just wasn't working, you know.  It wasn't quite...  I see that.  I see that.  I have, you know...  There are certain situations where I just...  I try to do the right thing, but I'm weak.  I'm too fucking weak.  You know. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, it's fine!  Very good.  What are you going to do?  We got Josh in Cleveland.  Josh.  Hey there, Josh.  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Well, Josh, I'm going to ask you a question before you talk about what you want to.  Okay.  How is LeBron James and his flu going?  Swine flu.  Are they starting to say swine flu?  I heard it today.  Who gives a shit is the answer.  Very good.  This morning, swine flu. 
[01:46:00]  They're starting to say swine flu?  Yes, they are.  I guess it's him and a bunch of the Cavaliers, huh?  Damn.  Fucking up the beginning of their season.  I think they got a big game with Boston.  Yeah.  Right out of the box.  Yep.  Josh, what do you got?  Hey, I was wondering if you heard anything about maybe CW11 having a health expert in  next week.  Maybe Jill could ask if it's healthy to have pizza grease come out of your ass.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  I, nigh.  I, nigh.  I, nigh. 
[01:46:30]  I, nigh.  I, nigh.  Oh.  And then he's gone.  Perfect phone call, Josh.  Perfect phone call.  Let me say how to chew.  Chew.  Oh, okay.  What's up?  Hey.  Not much.  Hey, I think I saw that video.  I think while she was burning the clothes, Jill and all her friends were standing around  going gang, gang, gang, gang.  Gang, gang, gang.  Gang, gang, gang.  I got Anthony, I got Anthony Dix, a saxophone deck. 
[01:47:00]  Gang, gang, gang.  Gang, gang, gang, gang.  Oh.  Uh, Keith, what's going on?  Keith, the cop.  Yeah.  Now, it just hit me because when he started talking about it and playing the clip, I may  have been the one holding the camera when she made the video clip.  Now, why were you holding the camera?  Because when I walked into the house, and I honestly don't remember whether or not I  did, but it's starting to get to me because I remember walking in the house and then seeing 
[01:47:30]  the flame from the window and walking out there and seeing her with the can of lighter fluid  as it was going up.  And you know how she was with the camera all the time?  And I think she might have asked me to tape it.  It was an inside job.  Jesus Christ, Keith.  It was an inside job when your guys videotaped it.  I honestly don't remember whether I did.  I may have.  Well, someone's got to get a hold of that video.  We've got to check it out.  Yeah, I want to see that.  Tell her it'll be good publicity for her. 
[01:48:00]  We'll fucking promote her Twitter or whatever.  Listen, it was pretty funny to stand there and watch it, so the video's got to be funny.  Jesus Christ.  Thanks a lot for the help, Keith.  There's definitely a video.  She's definitely showed her coworkers, so why not show us somehow?  You know, she doesn't...  I'll do it.  I'll reach out.  Post it.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Thanks, Keith.  All right.  There goes Keith.  Jesus Christ.  Let's go to Space Trucker.  Space Trucker.  What do you got, Space? 
[01:48:30]  Why don't...  Anthony, why don't you just admit it?  It was the anal leakage thing that made you break up with it.  Jesus Christ.  I love this voice.  I said we're going to live that now.  You can't read Walker.  Ooh, look.  Thank you, Space Trucker.  What do you got?  Good boy.  Nudie pictures.  Well, those are the old school Playboy ones, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, we all saw the Playboy ones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  What is she doing there, Anthony?  Oh, I don't know. 
[01:49:00]  It's showing something.  She's opening up her back end.  It's something to me.  She's opening up her back end so you can see where the poop comes out.  Website fucking tag on it.  Oh, fucking Steve.  Jesus Christ.  Steve with his fucking website tag.  That has nothing to do with you, so why are you fucking tagging someone else's pictures?  It's enough.  Ah, there you go.  That was always a good one.  You saw that live?  Well, that was good, you know.  The old, um...  In and out?  Holy shit. 
[01:49:30]  Uh-huh.  Uh, let's go to Sean.  Sean?  Hey, when this first happened, Jill said that Keith the cop was holding the video, and Bill  was the one taking the video and laughing, and he was on the air, absolutely denying that  he was leaving the house that she was pulling in.  He had no idea that he knew what she was doing.  You know, this guy is absolutely right.  I was always under the assumption that Keith was, like, pulled up right when she was leaving  and saw these, you know, the burning stuff in the pit. 
[01:50:00]  After she left, though.  After she was leaving.  When Keith went into the house.  When she was leaving.  Because I think it was something like, Jill said, hey, Keith, and Keith just waved that  she was leaving, and she had a big smile on her face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, apparently, Keith was there the entire time and helped out.  He was an accessory to the fact, videotaping it.  You know, if someone's committing a murder, and you videotape it, you are going to be charged  as an accessory. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  So, she's burning stuff, and Keith is, you know, just merrily videotaping it, and then  lets her just leave.  With the evidence.  Yeah.  Rick in Rockland.  Rick.  Anthony, don't you pay this guy to fucking watch over your house?  What, was there a salary dispute?  What the fuck is going on?  I guess, technically, he was watching.  You know, Rick does make a pretty good point there, Ed.  I don't know.  Wow.  Isn't his whole job to keep you safe? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Holy shit.  You need to pick your friends better, Molly.  He's holding the video camera.  He's the one holding the camera.  Holy mother of God.  I'm listening to this shit.  I'm like, he can't be fucking serious.  He should have had the hose out, been putting the fire out, and kicking her out.  He should have had your desert eagle pumping a couple of slugs in her back.  Oh, wow.  It's a little extreme.  My friend, a little extreme.  Well, just some of the comments coming in.  Keith is a traitor. 
[01:51:30]  Keith, what a backstabbing ass.  Keith offered to be her sponsor.  Keith made Jill do seven separate takes.  Oh, you know what?  Here we go.  Rob on Long Island.  Rob?  Yeah.  First of all, I bet you Keith is on that tape, and he's trying to fucking clear himself before  he's seen.  Secondly, he did what that six-year-old did.  I did it for the show.  See you later. 
[01:52:00]  Very good.  Let's go to Dan in Jersey.  Dan?  Yeah, I'd like to apply to replace Keith as Anthony's manservant.  Oh, wow.  You want a new manservant?  Nah, Keith's doing a good job.  That might have been one indiscretion that was made.  A little one, right?  An indiscretion that was made.  He will be reprimanded.  Watch that, guys.  Oh, this is a very good point.  Matt in Jersey.  Matt?  What's up, Matt?  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I think now that Keith's come clear about all this incident, Anthony's come clear about  what he really said about Keith's daughter. 
[01:52:30]  See you.  I didn't say anything.  Jesus.  Keith?  Listen, there may be some inconsistencies in this story, but I may have fucking loyalty.  I may have walked in and seen her doing it.  I did.  I did.  He's falling apart.  Now, I thought...  Keith's going to start puking, I think.  I thought you said you were pulling up as she was leaving and just found the remnants.  Listen, if the video surfaces, it's going to be good radio. 
[01:53:00]  It's over a year ago.  Gino in Jersey's calling Keith, Fredo the cop.  Fredo the cop.  Fredo the cop.  I didn't want to put myself in a situation.  Right.  But I may have walked in and saw it happening and said, listen, I don't want to be a fucking  part of this.  But I'll hold the camera. 
[01:53:30]  But I'll hold the fucking camera, because it is fucking funny.  Jesus.  What the hell's going on in your house?  Oh, well, that was well over a year ago.  Your whole house needs an intervention.  What are you going to do?  I do feel like it's one of those things that I have blocked out until it was just talked  about, because I honestly don't remember whether I held the camera.  Yeah.  I hear you.  And it's like it jogged my memory all of a sudden, and I was like, oh, shit.  Well, maybe I don't remember.  But I walked in and I saw it starting to shit. 
[01:54:00]  I admit it.  I admit it.  They say you were hiding behind the blue wall of silence.  It was, uh, uh, geez, Keith, did you let her burn the house?  Would you let her burn the house down, too?  Oh, it was in a confined, that's what the fire pit's for.  It was contained.  Jesus Christ.  So, so now we're hearing that you definitely walked in, saw it happening, and possibly held  the camera, because we're going over the old tape to see what you said originally. 
[01:54:30]  Oh.  Yeah, like, I didn't think that that was going to happen.  Of course, I had to fucking call back.  I suppose it was behind Sam, I'm sure, is fucking back there, ripping through it as  fast as he can.  No, actually, it's a member of Team Anthony doing it.  What is it, Travis?  Travis is doing it.  All right.  All right.  Travis is doing it.  Wow.  Part of Team Anthony.  Team Anthony.  One of your own guys is looking for the tape, eh?  Wow.  All right there.  It did, it did, but I saw it.  I saw it first, man. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, it's getting in the middle of that stickiness.  You know, you don't want to get it.  Listen, I'm going to, I'm going to, he's like the little boy's father.  I love Jilly and, you know, I don't want to get in the middle of that.  Jilly?  I don't want to hold the camera.  I hear you.  You were just, you know, it was still during that time where, you know, we didn't know what  was going on.  Right.  Right.  Right. 
[01:55:30]  It was fresh.  It was day two in it.  Exactly.  Who knew?  It could have been patched together, you know.  Who knows?  Jesus.  Thanks.  All right.  Let me, uh, take it easy there, Keith.  Keith will call back when we find the original audio.  Let's go to R.C. in Missouri.  R.C.  Yeah.  Hello, Opie.  Hey, R.C.  Uh, Anthony should look at this on the bright side.  At least if there's a home invasion, there will be a video of that also. 
[01:56:00]  Fucking Keith.  He'll just tape everything that happened.  Some homeboy will go, hey, can you take this so I can show my boys back in my crib?  Yeah, take this, yo.  And Keith's just filming the home invasion as it's going down.  All right.  Yeah.  Very good.  Um, let me go to Eric in Jersey.  Eric.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, I was just wondering, uh, in that nude pic, can you see the bags of rocks attached  to her chest?  Oh, my goodness.  Geez.  Wow.  And it's trying to get that relationship back together.  That's not going to help.  What?  I'm sorry, guys.  There's a part two that's in the making. 
[01:56:30]  No, I think that's, uh.  They're talking about that.  No.  Uh, they're now calling Keith, uh, Paul from Florida, Keith Left Eye Lopez.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And Stephen asks from Bayshore, Keith actually made Jill wait a half hour so the ambient  lighting would be more flattering.  Yes.  Yes, he needed the sun to set a little more.  Let's go to Matt in Jamestown.  Matt.  Keith's falling apart worse than Ross when he gave out his password on the NEL radio. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, Keith is like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Let's go to Larry King.  He's got something on this.  Oh.  Keith, how important is the loyalty?  Let's go to David in Denver.  David, did you see Balloon Boy?  No, I didn't.  I was busy hiding out in the attic with him.  Anyhow, you know, Keith said he loves Julie,  but I recall him complaining about the pink luggage 
[01:57:30]  and having to go pick up her coffee because it wasn't right.  Well, I think he's got a different story here.  He's crumbling.  Yeah, he's definitely crumbling.  No, he's come clean now over a year later, year and a half later.  The information comes out.  A year and a half later, right.  Well, until the next time.  See ya.  He was the one holding the video camera.  Well, there's more coming in.  Doug in Chicago.  Doug.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Just wondering if Keith has any good footage of her packing up the laptop, 
[01:58:00]  maybe putting it in the truck, driving away with the truck,  if you have any footage of any of that.  Yeah, let's remember that some of your stuff left the house as well.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess.  Watch it out, boys.  All right.  I guess Keith didn't see that part.  Let's go to Sean in Albany.  This is the big story now, Ant.  I know.  Balloon Boy, the second biggest story of the day now.  Breaking news.  Sean, what do you got?  There's no way that Keith would have not known about that.  What you do, load everything, then go back to burn the stuff, and then leave? 
[01:58:30]  There's no way he would not have seen her loading stuff into her car.  I know.  I don't know.  I don't think.  Did he steal one of your vehicles?  I can't.  Well, that was the night.  Let's see.  I think she had returned the vehicle on the day of the burning.  So she came back with my vehicle and then burnt the stuff and then left in her vehicle.  After stealing your vehicle, he let her still walk around through the house and burn stuff. 
[01:59:00]  You know, when you put it that way.  Well, let's go to Don in Jersey.  Don.  Yeah.  Anthony, you can't let him get away with that.  He was your he-bitch.  Your little man-slut.  He can't just walk in and watch her do that crap.  Well, you know, I don't know.  I'm going to have to delve deeper into this.  And see what the story is. 
[01:59:30]  You know, we're talking over a year ago now.  Cock was curled up in his ass when he seen her.  It's also coming in, Mark, in Northern Virginia.  Keith also has video of Bigfoot, Anthony.  Oh, really?  And Hugh from Myrtle Beach.  How could I stop her?  Quoting Keith, right?  I'm only a cop.  Let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  A lot of calls from Jersey today.  What up, Steve? 
[02:00:00]  Hey, listen, Keith.  This story has more holes in it than the Balloon Boy story.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you getting some intel in?  It's a little distracted.  The whole time.  What's going on over there?  Are you getting intel?  Yeah.  I don't, I'm getting something in here, but, but it doesn't seem like this is supposed  to be for me.  What does it say? 
[02:00:30]  I painted you in there.  And I showed you the videos.  I have no idea what you're saying.  Oh, I guess Steve is filling him in?  Steve is filling in who?  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  This message didn't make sense.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We're going to continue with this because people have a lot of questions about it.  We're going to have the latest on Balloon Boy.  We got Iron Sheet coming in to talk about the allegations that he smoked crack and molested 
[02:01:00]  a ring boy.  Smoked crack.  And I think we got Big A and Bobo doing the news today because it's a big news day.  Wow.  We haven't had Big A do the news in quite a long time.  Bobo.  So for the newbies, you're going to enjoy Big A doing the news.  He does a terrific job for us.  He does.  He's wonderful.  So lots still to do.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Ah, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, huh?  It's Friday.  Opie and Anthony, thanks for checking us out.  This is a busy show. 
[02:01:30]  We're going to have more audio of Jill talking about you in a few minutes.  Why?  What happened?  That's just breaking right now.  Just breaking right now.  They're cutting it up down the hall.  Also, more on Balloon Boy, the Iron Sheik.  He's got some questions to answer today, my friend.  Allegations of what?  Child molestation by another wrestler.  And some crack smoking.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  Also, there was something else, something else.  Oh, yeah.  Big A and Bobo are going to be coming in in a minute or two.  Okay, good.  Sorry.  My last bite of my bagel.  It's all right.  It's all fucking right.  We found something out about Bobo, a new one, a new tick he has.  If you say anything that's true to Bobo, he'll go, yeah, that's right.  Yeah, that's right.  So we want to see how many times we can get him to say, yeah, that's right.  Yeah, that's right.  What's an example? 
[02:02:30]  I can ask him.  Hey, Bobo, are you a Mets fan?  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, exactly.  Okay.  Do you like Christina?  Yeah, that's right.  Or I should be saying you like Christina.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, that's right.  Right, okay.  And every time we get him to do that, we'll hit the old bell so he can play along at home.  You can even ring a fake bell if you're in your car, like ding.  Steve from Bay Show is saying, hey, Bobo, you got fucked by your brother.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, that's right.  He doesn't know we're saying this right now. 
[02:03:00]  No.  Because as soon as he...  It's a not soundproof boot.  Well, as soon as he's aware of a bit, you know, he's so smart that he just like blows the bit.  He wrecks it.  He tries to do it too hard.  Right.  Puddle of AIDS writes, it's Jocktober.  I don't even know if we're going to get to Jocktober today.  He writes, the Light FM 106.7 here in New York City.  Question of the day.  Ready for this question of the day?  A big radio station here in New York City.  Don't even tell me.  Just asked.  That question.  It's not, unfortunately.  Oh, that would have been a good one.  Yeah.  After a breakup, what's the number one thing that 99% of the people do? 
[02:03:30]  Burn.  Burn.  Burn clothing.  Clothing in a fire pit while the guy that's supposed to protect the man is videotaping it.  Yes, that's the correct answer.  Puddle of AIDS.  This question was just asked on a big radio station.  Women do this once a week, but dread it.  We're not giving the answer.  I'm not giving the fucking answer. 
[02:04:00]  Let me think.  I'm not giving the fucking answer.  Give a shit.  Yeah.  Tickle their clit with a rake.  What?  Tickle their clit with a rake.  We should get Bobo and Big A in here.  Is Bobo ready to go?  Probably.  In like a minute, I think he's just wrapping up with Derek in production right now.  What are they doing in production?  Anything good?  Probably.  Probably.  Isn't it always?  When Derek sits in a room for eight hours a day with no windows, you always get something good. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, that's true.  We got Big A, too.  D-boy.  Ready to do the news.  Big A is lumbering down the hallway right now.  Wow.  Bobo, when he walks down the hall, he walks down the hall wall to wall.  He is just a big man.  And wow, look at Bobo.  We haven't seen him in such a long time.  Yeah.  Get Bobo in here first.  Hi.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Bobo.  It's Bobo.  Hi, Bobo.  Let me just describe what we're looking at here.  Bobo has a hat on. 
[02:05:00]  It's a serious little doggy hat that has a NASCAR flag.  You know, the old finish line flag in its mouth.  And then we're looking, you have a race collection Gordon 24, performance leader, DuPont shirt.  I guess that's Jeff Gordon.  Yeah, that's correct.  That's correct.  Anything on the back of that shirt?  No, there's nothing on the back.  Just trying to paint the picture.  There's nothing on the back of the shirt.  Black jeans or something? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, those are black jeans.  And white sneakers.  So that is what Bobo looks like.  And, of course, it's patented Bobo glasses.  And, Bobo, you're a Mets fan.  Yeah, that's right.  Dang.  Yeah.  Now, wow.  A Mets fan.  That's got to suck.  So you're a Mets fan?  Yeah, that's right.  I don't even look at the playoffs when they don't make it.  Really?  You're not going to watch the Yankees?  The Yankees?  That's terrible. 
[02:06:00]  No, I'll watch the game.  But if there's something else I want to watch on at the same time, I'll watch that instead of DVR it at the same time.  Well, you're from New York.  I do pay attention to the game.  Are you from New York?  Yeah, I do.  I do pay attention to the games.  I'm not ready to go to the game.  If I got a friend of mine, if there's a friend of mine that, maybe some friends that are Yankee fans, I've congratulated them when they've won the series. 
[02:06:30]  Bobo, so you are a NASCAR fan?  Yeah, that's right.  All right.  NASCAR fan.  And is Jeff Gordon your favorite?  Yeah, that's right.  Okay.  I've actually attended two races already.  Oh, you have?  Yeah, Homestead in 1999.  First race at the Homestead-Miami Speedway.  Yeah.  And Bobo, you have a sister.  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, okay.  And she has a dog? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, she has a dog.  Oh.  All right.  So, okay.  And you live in Queens?  Yeah, that's right.  Well, we're just trying to get some of this out there for the listeners that haven't heard you yet.  You know, you're a big star, but there's still a lot of people that don't know much about you.  Biography.  And you have a major crush on Christina?  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, that's right.  I even invited her to go with me to see Jimmy at the Stress Factory in November.  Oh!  Is she going to go with you? 
[02:07:30]  Well, she said let her know the days.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're saying that you asked her on a date to see Jim Norton at the Stress Factory?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Okay.  Well, I know she likes Jimmy.  I know she enjoys Jimmy's comedy.  Who doesn't?  And you like Jimmy.  Yeah, of course.  Jimmy's great.  Oh, okay.  Mm-hmm.  And is it true your uncle works at the Queen's Motor Inn?  Yes, that's right.  He works at the Queen's Motor Inn, but unfortunately, he's not sure he can get discounts or anything like that. 
[02:08:00]  But I asked my uncle, I figured that, that's why I actually invited, that's why I remember that time I said that about Christina, that I bring her out to the Queen's Motor Inn.  Well, yeah, I didn't remember that.  What happened was, I asked my uncle, can he get me a discount?  He says, oh, I'm not sure about that.  Right, right, right.  He could get me a discount.  I was thinking maybe he could get me some kind of discount.  Since he works there, you'd think he would. 
[02:08:30]  And with all the exposure on the show, you're getting recognized now?  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  I've gotten stopped on the subway.  Uh-huh.  I think once I got stopped on, I forgot, around my block, one of my neighbors realized I was on the show.  You're getting recognized in your neighborhood.  Yeah, exactly.  There's actually someone in my neighborhood that actually knows me, that knows me from the show. 
[02:09:00]  From the show?  Yeah.  Have you been recognized at a Mets game?  Yeah, I have been.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Do you wear anything that people would, like, recognize you for, or they just know you from your voice?  Sometimes they seem, sometimes, I think, I don't know, like one person heard my voice that maybe I was wearing a serious hoodie one time.  Now, you always wear Mets logo stuff, right?  Not all the time.  At the game, I mean. 
[02:09:30]  At the game, of course.  At the game, of course.  I suck at this.  Well, we haven't seen you in a while, Bobo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's been a while.  It's been a while, right?  Yep.  Tim in Boston, what's up?  I want to tell Bobo how compelling he is on the radio and how much I just love it when he comes on.  Yeah.  The show, great.  Yeah.  You really do a good job for us, Bobo.  All right.  That's good to know.  And we thank you.  All right. 
[02:10:00]  Someone's saying, if you wear a shirt that says, hi, I'm Bobo.  That would be pretty silly.  Are you fighting with a fake Bobo on Twitter?  Yeah.  There is a fake Bobo.  A guy that says, I am the real Bobo on Twitter.  Uh-oh.  So, what I'm going to do to finally give him some good proof that Mr. Met 8, in fact, is the real Bobo, I am going to tweet a picture of me actually on Twitter, and they'll see evidence of me in front of the screen, hopefully with, they'll see evidence that I vote. 
[02:10:30]  So, to help you out, if people are following you on Twitter, I am the real Bobo, you're going to have a picture of yourself, right?  Huh.  Yeah, my Twitter account is Mr. Met 8.  Oh, that's the fake guy?  So, you're, I am the, well, you're obviously, I am the real Bobo.  No, I am the real Bobo is a fake imposter. 
[02:11:00]  But he says, I am the real Bobo.  So, that's got to be the real Bobo.  And he's got a picture of himself.  Yeah, and he's got a picture.  And a wow, and a wow logo, which means that's you.  Yeah, but that guy took my, that guy stole my picture.  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  No, you are lying.  I'm not lying.  Because that's what celebrities do.  They say, I am the real, and then whoever it is.  Just to prove to everybody that they're the real celebrity and not the fake celebrity Twitter account.  Yeah, but the thing is, they got to, yeah, but the thing is, they got to remember, there was, before, when I first opened that Twitter account. 
[02:11:30]  What?  When I first opened my Twitter account, I did not, there was only one person that knew me as Bobo at the time.  Oh, and who was that?  That was my sister.  Your sister calls you Bobo?  She was the only one who knew me by that name.  Does your sister call you Bobo?  Yeah, she does.  She's called me that since she was a baby.  Well, it's pretty smart that you got a new account and says, I am the real Bobo.  Because that puts an end to the whole, you know, controversy.  War over.  You won, my friend.  I am the real Bobo. 
[02:12:00]  We got to promote the shit out of that.  That's not even my Twitter account.  That's not even my Twitter account.  Who the heck is this imposter that's putting...  He talks in Morse code.  Da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Who the heck is this imposter that's been putting up this stuff on, uh...  Mr. Met 8?  Yeah, I understand.  No, no, no, no, no.  Mr. Met 8 is actually my Twitter, which is good, so...  No, Mr. Met 8 is actually my Twitter account.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Mr. Met 8? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, that's my Twitter account.  Oh, so...  Oh, I understand.  A lot of people have two Twitter accounts, so that's when you're just talking Met shit,  but for all the other Bobo stuff, I am the real Bobo.  I got it.  We're all set now.  No, there's a guy...  All right, let's bring Big A in here.  Thank you, Bobo.  That's great.  You're going to help us out with the news today, Bobo?  Yeah, I am.  All right.  You got some opinions on Balloon Boy and all that?  Yeah, I...  All right.  Save it for when we get to that story, my friend.  And here he is, ladies and gentlemen.  Good to see the diet's working, my brother.  Ah, Big A. 
[02:13:00]  Big A, in studio.  It's been a while.  How are you, Big A?  Oh, hi, Opie.  Not bad.  Yeah.  Hi, how you doing?  Hi.  Very, very well.  Okay.  Good to see you again.  See you too again.  Nice to have you here in the studio.  It's been quite a while.  What have you been up to?  Just working and hanging out.  Nothing much.  Yeah, just working, hanging out.  That is exciting as Bobo, but I try. 
[02:13:30]  Ah.  So what have you been doing?  How have you been hanging out?  Where have you been going?  Um, um, not too many places.  So I work at night.  So I really, it cuts my hanging out time.  Well, you find time on FH Riley's, though.  I appreciate that, my friend.  I see you tweeting about FH.  Probably appreciates it.  Are you still driving the cab?  Uh, uh, yes, but the business is real slow. 
[02:14:00]  Business is slow, huh?  Yeah.  Why is that?  Uh, I guess, you know, bad financials.  What?  I was breathing like that.  Holy shit.  You hear that?  Those big juicy lips of Bobo.  He's trying to get air.  Bobo is breathing like a fucking...  What's wrong with your breathing?  I thought it was big A, but it's definitely Bobo.  Like the fucking T-Rex.  I don't think I'm breathing heavy.  I can hear it in the microphone. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  I heard...  That's just my nose hairs.  No, I'm quiet.  It's your nose hairs?  No, it's my nose.  It was breathing through my nose.  Oh, well, I heard it on the mic.  Very funny.  I didn't even realize I was breathing that heavy.  Very funny.  Oh, not very funny.  This thing damn picks up everything.  What, that big hunker of yours? 
[02:15:00]  No, this thing picks up just even the slightest breathing.  What?  What thing?  Oh, the microphone.  Yeah.  Very sensitive.  Yeah, very sensitive.  So, big A, what, uh, that cab thing, how do people get it?  Do they hail you?  Do they hold up their hand and go, whew, taxi?  Actually, they call my company.  The company dispatches out the calls.  And you're not getting that many calls?  Um, I've been kind of slow.  Yeah?  Lately, yeah.  Yeah, and making ends meet, though? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Paying the bills?  Able to pay the bills?  Yeah, just barely, yeah.  Just barely.  Are you going to find another job?  Um, I was thinking about it, about how many jobs are out there, because a lot of people  are losing their jobs all over the place.  Right, right, right.  Obama will help you.  Yeah.  Obama will help you.  He's going to give you a handout.  Yeah, you're, you're an Obama supporter, right?  No, huh? 
[02:16:00]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  He's just laughing.  He's just giggling there.  You don't like Obama?  Well, is it because he's a, uh, a, uh, you know, you know, a Democrat?  Yeah.  Maybe you could go down to the, uh, maybe you could go down to the U.N. and become a translator.  Yeah, that could be possible.  Oh, thank God.  Maybe I'll translate Iron Sheik.  Oh. 
[02:16:30]  Are you guys fans of the Iron Sheik?  Yeah, of course.  Always.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  That guy brings so much entertaining moments to the show.  He's been on our show twice in two years.  Yeah, but during, but during those, during those two times, he's always, he, the guy's  always an entertaining character.  My brother does a good impersonation of the Sheik.  Oh, does he?  It's quality, not quantity.  Right, Bobo?  Yep, that's right.  That's right.  I'm with you.  Yep.  All right. 
[02:17:00]  You want to do the news with, uh, Big A?  Sure, no problem.  You guys can move to the big table.  Just don't sit down.  So we can see you better.  You can move the chairs out of the way, too.  We haven't done a Big A news in a while, right, Big A?  It's been quite a while.  A long fucking time.  How's this going to work?  Big A's going to do the stories, and I think Bobo's going to do the commentary.  Because, Bobo, we noticed you could riff off the cuff.  Yeah, off the cuff.  You just go.  You hear a story, and you know how to just take it and give your opinion on it. 
[02:17:30]  Yep, that's right.  I just noticed that recently there's this balloon boy.  Well, we're not doing it yet, Bobo.  We're just setting up the fact that you're really good at just, you know,  coming up with commentary when it comes to these big news stories.  So this is how it's going to work, Bobo.  Big A reads the news story, and then you're the commentator,  and then you give your opinions on it, all right?  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, yes, Danny.  Assignment.  I'm sorry.  I did give Bobo an assignment. 
[02:18:00]  I don't know if he completed that assignment,  but I did attempt to have him write some stories of his own.  Oh.  Did you write stories of your own, Bobo?  I was actually doing it at the same time they called me for something.  Oh, you didn't do it last night.  Didn't do your homework?  I just did today.  I didn't.  They just asked me.  They just asked me to do it today.  All right.  Well, we'll see how you do.  Let's start with the news.  It's Big A and Bobo with the news.  Go ahead, Big A. 
[02:18:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Big A is back with news and more stupendous than ever. 
[02:19:00]  Let's not stammer around here and get right to the news.  A 40-year-old woman says she is an abortion addict 
[02:19:30]  and has had 15 abortions in 17 years.  Wow.  Because her husband couldn't... 
[02:20:00]  Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um 
[02:20:30]  She's a state that she would  up, taking her birth control pill, and get pregnant. 
[02:21:00]  She would get excited, and then panicked, because she wanted her husband to  stay with her, so she would get an abortion.  She also says that she tried to 
[02:21:30]  her whole life, several times during her marriage.  Bobo, what is your answer on this? 
[02:22:00]  Yes, Bobo.  And talk about a suicidal wife.  I'm shocked what the heck's going to happen if he...  I can only imagine what kind of crazy stuff.  I guess maybe he could divorce and not have to worry about it, because she'll commit  suicide eventually.  Suicide.  Suicide.  This is horrendous.  A bomb in a wall. 
[02:22:30]  He can't even...  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's...  Suicide.  Suicide.  Terrific, Bobo.  Thank you for that.  Oh, my God.  Do we all need to take a breath?  Wow.  Wow.  What's the next story there, big guy?  Do we have another...  We have another story?  Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, television... 
[02:23:00]  A station in Washington is coming across by training the newscasters to work their own teletype machines.  Yeah.  Um, um, um, the newscasters will use a series of hand levers and foot pedals. 
[02:23:30]  Uh, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, so, um...  Some air from members at the station are worried that the new system can increase the chances for on-air plunges 
[02:24:00]  and stumbles, the station will begin training the new cases soon. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, Bobo, your take on this story?  Yeah, this is a big one.  I wouldn't be surprised if you see any of them react like Ron Burgundy, like Will Ferrell in the movie Anger Man.  The guy that he would read.  Anger Man?  Anger Man?  Anger Man.  Anger Man.  Anger Man?  Yes, it's Steve.  Steve, Steve.  Yes, it's Anger Man.  It's Anger Man. 
[02:25:00]  Anger Man.  Suicide and Anger Man.  Anger Man.  Right on, Bobo, right on.  Continue.  You like that movie Anger Man?  I liked it.  Yeah, I thought it was fun.  I didn't like it at first, but the more I see it, I appreciate Anger Man more and more.  I thought it was funny.  I wouldn't be surprised if someone ends up doing what Will Ferrell's character did every time.  What's a Will Ferrell?  Will Ferrell in Anger Man?  The guy would read it. 
[02:25:30]  If there was a mistake on a teleprompter, he would read it.  I wouldn't be surprised if you'd see people reading teleprompter mistakes on air.  Like Will Ferrell in Anger Man.  Right, right.  Like if someone accidentally put, like, just misworded something, like misspelled something.  Oh, who would do that?  They would read it like that on the teleprompter.  Yeah.  Is that what you got?  That's pretty good commentary.  This is why you're in here today, Bobo.  I like how you think off the cuff. 
[02:26:00]  Mm-hmm.  You're very good at improv-ing.  I'll tell you that much.  Just nail it.  Big A, what do you got on Balloon Boy?  Okay.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Hit him in the back.  Us. 
[02:26:30]  Us.  And.  Phew.  Nation.  Yeah.  Um.  Um.  Um.  Um.  He's sweating.  Wow.  You got this.  Big A, you got this.  Go ahead.  Um.  Um.  Um.  Us.  Don't worry about it. 
[02:27:00]  It's just the early version of the AOL.  Bobo.  What?  What?  What do you mean, Bobo?  No.  No.  Because I mean, it feels like a dial.  It feels like those dial-up connections when you're waiting and waiting.  Oh, okay.  He's great at commentary. 
[02:27:30]  And off the cuff.  That improv.  Bobo is amazing.  Off the cuff.  That improv.  Back to Big A.  On Balloon Boy.  Um.  Um.  Oh.  I think this is the code.  It'll probably be the word that shuts me down.  Holy shit.  Um.  Holy. 
[02:28:00]  You got this, Big A.  You got this.  Just read what's in front of you.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Oh, he's sweating, Paulus. 
[02:28:30]  Holy shit.  Come on, Big A.  You got this.  Oh, relations.  Relations.  Relations.  Oh.

Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  You got this.  Uh-huh. 
[02:29:30]  Visions.  You got this.  It's like trying to turn over a car in the cold weather.  Yeah.  A stunned nation.  A stunned nation.  What?  A stunned nation.  Uh-huh. 
[02:30:00]  Fuck.  Oh, my God.  Sound it out.  Sound it out.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  A stunned nation.  Mm-hmm.  Nations.

[02:35:30]  um  the  um  um  uh  um  uh  uh  um  uh  um  I built a balloon for a weather experiment. 
[02:36:00]  After the nation's media watched this balloon, I'm heading for this, this, this, this, this, 
[02:36:30]  this, this, this, this, this horror is...  Oh, my God.  Wow.  The attention.  The attention.  The attention. 
[02:37:00]  Charved parents.  stated in interviews  that this was not  a  stupid  stupid  stupid  stupid  stupid  stupid  stupid  stupid  Whoa!  Wow!  Damn, yo! 
[02:37:30]  And there you have it.  Bobo, what do you got on that story?  Well, I have to say, that whole balloon story was a big letdown, especially, I can't believe  how the news wasted their time on that coverage, and there was nobody inside the balloon all  this time, this guy's at home, this kid's at home, and there's nothing in the balloon,  and they're making it look like, oh, there's a kid inside the balloon, and there wasn't.  That's not really commentary.  That kid wouldn't have even survived had he been in that balloon. 
[02:38:00]  Why?  Yeah.  That, a drop that high, I don't think anyone could survive a drop that high in a balloon  like that.  It came down very soft.  Yeah, but that, but from what I heard, but from what I heard from my uncle, who served,  who served in the military, told me that a kid wouldn't be able to survive a drop that  high, like that, on that kind of balloon.  But the balloon came down very softly.  We saw it come down softly.  Yeah, but there was, there was no one, there was, there was no, there was no, there was 
[02:38:30]  no one inside it, and, and obviously there wasn't any, any like way that, that if things,  I don't know, I guess maybe there was some, maybe some kind of restraints or something  that maybe the kid should, probably would have forgotten to, to where, let's just say the  guy was playing around with, the kid was playing around with the balloon, and wound up in the  balloon, but didn't really know anything, because he's six years old, he's the guy, I think  that, that kid would have, uh, probably not, not survived.  Right.  Fuck.  All right, there you go. 
[02:39:00]  There's your commentary from Bobo and Big A with the big news story of the day.  Holy shit.  That is amazing.  Wow.  That's just amazing.  I gotta say, Big A, um, never, never saw you have so much trouble before.  Are you a little more nervous today being here?  What, what, what do you think, uh, attributed to the, the difficulty factor in, in, in reading  that, those news stories?  Um, uh, maybe, hold on, I also did a, uh, small little promo, but, um, I mean, I don't 
[02:39:30]  know, for some reason, you're locked up bad today.  You're locked up bad today.  Look at his shirt, he's sweating.  I, I, I think, I think, I, I think, I think his brain upgrade, upgraded to Vista is what  happened.  Oh, wow.  Oh, Bobo.  And let's go to the phone and say hi to Dave in Tennessee.  Dave.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Dave.  Better give the medics, uh, a call, because I think he might be having a, a row. 
[02:40:00]  You wouldn't know the difference if he was.  No.  How would you know?  He probably would start talking really normal.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Walker in Texas.  Walker.  What's up?  Hey, Walker.  Hey, man.  I got to take up a donation plate to get this dude some rectum phonics.  Son of a bitch.  He was struggling so bad that I got nervous going into work.  Yeah.  I'm sweating like a whore in church right now.  Yeah, you know what? 
[02:40:30]  I'm sweating.  Look.  That's sweat marks all over me, too.  It just gets.  I don't know what it is, but it makes you start sweating.  It gets hot in here.  It gets really hot.  And you kind of find yourself, like, not breathing as much.  Yeah.  You start taking, like, just little shallow breaths.  Yeah.  It's very difficult to watch.  Let's go to Ted in Hillboro.  Ted.  Morning, boys.  Hey, Ted.  When I heard him stuttering, I went in order an egg sandwich at the deli.  I came out.  He was still on the same word. 
[02:41:00]  Later.  All right.  Let's go to Nick in Brooklyn.  Nick.  That was fucking excruciating.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe you guys made us listen to that for that long.  Well, we don't make you listen to anything, Nick, if you think about it.  And look, reading the stories, it should have been...  Ten seconds.  Nothing.  Yeah.  I don't know what...  Yeah, it should have been, but now my fucking ears hurt.  I'm nauseous.  I don't know what to do, and I just ruined my whole life.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Blind Dave in Massachusetts. 
[02:41:30]  Blind Dave.  That was gold.  Perhaps Big A could supplement his income reading letters and mail for the blind.  Ah, there you go.  What about that?  You read letters and mail to the blind?  You know...  That would be wonderful.  Someone...  That was worse.  For the people that have been with us for a long time, that was the worst one ever.  Yeah.  By far.  Gold.  I was filming.  I had to give up at ten minutes, and he was on the same story. 
[02:42:00]  Anthony, someone, I would love to give him credit.  They want us to do a version of Cash Cab with Big A.  Oh, fuck.  Can you imagine?  That's a good one.  Let's go to Don in Vegas.  Don.  Don on the phone.  You motherfuckers.  I am up ten hours drinking, playing poker, hopping in my car, getting ready for work, and  I think my fucking radio is broken, because all I hear is...  I am about ready to throw this fucking thing out the window, search for my warranty, about 
[02:42:30]  radio call, serious support, until I realize that fucking retard is just out there stuttering.  Well, he's not retarded.  Put my whole morning up.  He's very smart.  He just has a problem communicating.  Hard getting from the brain out the mouth.  No, he just has a problem with the ST words, if you haven't figured that out.  Let's go to Matt in Poonocky.  Matt in Poonocky.  Stop stereotyping stammering stars, stupid.  Frank in Southampton. 
[02:43:00]  Frank?  Yeah, those two guys are killing me, man.  That's what happens when your mother smokes crack until the ninth month, and then you get  black semen all that time as well?  Jeez.  Oh, boy.  Big A, you want to comment?  He's kind of calling you retarded.  You got something for this guy there?  Frank in Southampton?  Actually, he's frankly, you know, I'm retarded.  Oh, shit.  Big A.  A big A. 
[02:43:30]  I was actually relying on you to convey that news story to me, because since I haven't heard  anything about it, it was so painful, my stomach hurts now.  All right, man.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Billy in Arkansas.  Billy?  Hey, I just want to say that I appreciate what big A's doing, because in my job, I work  out in the field, and I'm in and out of my truck all the time, and I have to work it  around.  I try to work around what's going on with you guys, and I've got a lot done this morning.  Oh, good.  Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, I knew I wasn't going to miss much, so I got it done. 
[02:44:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You bet.  All right.  All right.  Well, I think they did a great job, Big A and Bobo.  We're going to step aside and get the Iron Sheik in here, finally?  Oh, please.  You guys want to hang around for the Iron Sheik?  Sure.  Big fans?  Bobo?  Yeah?  Sure.  Sure?  Yeah, be an honor to meet the legendary Iron Sheik, whose appearances have been legends  on this show.  Legend?  Or legendary?  No, I meant his appearances have been legendary on the show. 
[02:44:30]  I'm going to commit suicide.  I'm going to get really anchor soon.  Yeah, anchor.  Anger, man.  Anger, man.  Whirl, Whirl, Whirl, Farrell, and Anger, man.  And sewer side.  Sewer side.  I think we got one more bit for Bobo.  I think Sam is working on something.  But yes, Big A.  What do you got?  I think...  You want to promote your appearance on the Ron and Fez show? 
[02:45:00]  No, no, no, no.  I think this proves Mr. Matt ate his Bobo because he's tweeting, spelling is as atrocious on the  tweets as it is on there.  Oh, damn.  That might be the bit we're doing.  Damn, yo.  Well, I have to admit, the computer that I've been using is atrocious as the spelling.  Atrocious. 
[02:45:30]  Atrocious as the spelling.  The computer my mom has, my mom freaking can't afford a high-speed connection.  So it's freaking dial-up half the time.  Dial-up?  Dial-up?  Who has dial-up anymore?  Even poor people don't have dial-up.  Well, my mother does.  But why?  Anyone can get a regular, you know, cable or something.  I don't know.  She's always thinking there's these hidden charges and stuff.  Yeah, and how does a bad computer make you spell wrong? 
[02:46:00]  Well, the computer is slow.  It doesn't respond quick enough when you type.  Quick enough for your fast, great spelling and typing?  It's your synapse that doesn't respond quickly.  Yeah.  In other words, if you type something quick enough, sometimes most computers will respond  quick enough.  This does not respond quick enough.  Okay.  It really, like, you probably need a magnifying glass.  Bobo, try spelling something on my computer, because mine works.  Yeah.  It's on high-speed connection.  What do you want him to spell? 
[02:46:30]  Let's give him an easy word.  No, you're the real Bobob.  He just spelled Bobob.  I am the real Bobo is a face.  I'm the real Bobo is a fake, but you wrote face first.  Okay.  Well, I was able to correct it quickly.  Microphone's Bobo.  Yeah, microphone.  I was able to correct it quickly, because it responded quicker.  My computer would have took it for, it would have took it a lot longer to type that word.  Yeah, it would have took it a lot longer. 
[02:47:00]  But typing stuff into word doesn't matter whether you're on a dial-up or a high-speed  connection.  Yeah, that's right.  But for some reason, the internet connection, for some reason, Twitter doesn't respond quickly  on my mother's computer.  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  All right, Larry King's checking in.  Larry!  Big A, how important is the frontal lobe?  And then we got Joe in Queens.  Joe.  Yeah, I thought Anthony had the best imitation, but Big A, you get kudos for the best imitation 
[02:47:30]  of buffering video I've ever heard.  Oh, wow.  Buffering.  Yeah, you're doing impressive.  Hey, you know what?  The nation was stunned yesterday.  So, Bobo, why don't you spell stunned for everybody on Danny's computer?  No excuses.  You don't have the dial-up.  Here's Bobo spilling.  Can we make it big so we can all zied?  So we can all zied.  We got a zied.  All right.  The nation was, there you go, stuned.  The nation was stuned. 
[02:48:00]  Well, I admit that too, and I depend on spell check.  But what I actually started doing yesterday is I started running Word at the same time  I'm running Twitter.  All right.  You stoned in 70, bitch.  Spell this.  There was also another story here about a 40-year-old woman.  All right.  Got it.  You're on.  I'm sorry.  How about you spell abortion?  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  We did that story about an hour ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:48:30]  Very good.  Oh, yes.  Aborteron.  A-B-O-R-T-O-R-O-N.  No, that was right.  Oh, okay.  That's better.  All right.  You're on, sir.  Go ahead.  He's re-spelling it.  All right.  A-B-A-R-T-S-T-I-O-N.  Abortion.  Abortion.  Abortion.  Abortion.  That's when you spell borscht on the floor.  I admit I depend on spell check.  All right.  Why don't we do a very easy one?  Just spell balloon. 
[02:49:00]  It's everywhere.  It's probably on all eight of our TVs right now.  Go ahead.  This is an easy one.  We'll give you an easy one, Bobo, because I think they're fucking with you.  Uh-huh.  B-A-L-L-O-N.  Come on.  It goes backwards.  Come on.  All right.  B-A-L-L-O-O-O-N.  Balloon.  All right.  B-A-L-L-O-O-O-N.  But before that, he said B-A-L-L-O-I-N.  Beloin.  Right.  Beloin.  Big A, give him a word to spell. 
[02:49:30]  Well, something in the news, something, I don't know, show-related.  What do you got?  Um.  How about F.H. Riley's?  F.H. Riley's?  F.H.  Part, I mean.  Yeah, I mean.  It's got the, uh.  I'll make it bigger again. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, we gotta make that bigger again.  There we go.  Let's see.  All right.  F.H.  He's got so far.  Capital F.  Lowercase h.  All right.  And he's got the F.H.  Right?  R.  A.I.L.L.Y.  Very good.  Yeah.  With the fucking.  F.H.  Raley.  F.H.  Raley's.  But even the apostrophe S has.  It's not an apostrophe.  It's a quotation mark. 
[02:50:30]  Quotation mark.  S.  S.  One more.  Weather.  Because it was a weather balloon yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  Here we go.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Damn.  You actually nailed that one.  You gotta be fucking kidding me.  Nailed it.  Yes, big guy.  Yes, I want to, um, help, um, to promote, um, November 7th, when the message is gonna be 
[02:51:00]  live.  Ah, yes.  You know, Bobo, you should try and spell weird medicine.  That's a very good idea.  Cool hoes.  For Dr. Steve.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Um, well, he's.  All right, hold on.  He's got the, all right, weird, W-E-R-I-D, medicine, M-E-D-I-C-E-N.  Very good.  Weird Medican. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  Well, I admit, back it, back it, as a matter of fact, back in the day before I started,  using computers a lot, I would actually, I actually had to depend on a dictionary for  spell check, and it took me a lot longer back in the day.  Yeah, but now it's not so bad.  Oh, yes, big A.  Big A, big A.  Big A, could you please tell us the host of Weird Medicine?  Mm-hmm.  Um, uh, doctors, uh, um, doctors, uh, um, doctors, uh, Steve. 
[02:52:00]  Ah, yes.  Doctors.  Steve.  Wait, what?  I didn't hear you, because I was, I was looking at my phone.  What was that again?  Um, uh, doctors.  That's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, Steve. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, it's Dr. Steve, indeed.  All right.  I look forward to, uh, Weird Medicine with Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  All right.  Exactly.  Should we take a break and get, uh, the Iron Sheik in here?  Please.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Take a break, get the Iron Sheik.  Needs to be sponged off.  Yeah.  Someone hosed him down.  Someone give him a sponge bath or something.  My God.  Bobo, good job.  Big A, good job.  Hang around.  Maybe you can ask, uh, the Iron Sheik a couple questions, okay?  All right.  All right, quick break, and we'll, uh, do the Iron Sheik thing next.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:53:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Opie and Anthony.  Iron Sheik making his way down the hall.  This could take a while.  The whole gang.  I think we got a bushwhacker and a, uh, who else?  Who else is it?  We had a bushwhacker and Iron Sheik.  Do you think I even know?  Lord, give a shit.  Oh, my God.  What are they doing?  They're walking slow.  Like, this isn't an entrance to a fucking boxing match.  Oh, they're walking slow because they're old. 
[02:53:30]  Well, Iron Sheik's got a cane now.  He didn't have a cane last time.  No.  Is that one of the bushwhackers?  Where's the bushwhacker guy?  I don't know.  Oh, I don't know who these people are.  Oh, they're working their way in.  Iron Sheik.  Here they are.  He's smiling.  He just saw us for the first time.  Oh, my God.  What can I do to occupy my hands?  I don't want to shake his hand.  I know.  We don't shake.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Iron Sheik.  Ah, there he is.  Making his big return to the Opie and Anthony show.  Please, please have a seat, gentlemen.  Yes, sir.  There they are. 
[02:54:00]  How you doing?  What's up, sir?  Sir.  Are you a bushwhacker?  No, I ain't a bushwhacker.  Who are you?  I look like a bushwhacker.  I don't know.  Who's the...  Oh, there's a bushwhacker.  I know the bushwhacker guy.  Can I give you a lick?  No, no, get out of here.  You can lick Sam's head.  Bushwhacker, lick Sam's head.  Does it taste like sardines, mate?  Yeah, go ahead.  Sardines.  Can you lick his head for us?  Like the old days?  Wait, where's this?  I'm going to hit you.  All right.  All right. 
[02:54:30]  We got a bushwhacker.  We got Iron Sheik.  Who else is in studio?  One of the demolitions.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, all right.  That's all right.  I'm sorry about that, sir.  That's all right.  I like the get-ups you guys have.  That fucking costume.  Yeah.  The demolition?  Yeah.  Yeah, you did all right.  Let's do it every once in a while.  Do it every so often.  You pop that thing on.  You guys remember talking in the mics?  That would be really helpful.  Yeah, there you go.  Talking to the mic like you're doing it.  And, of course, the Iron Sheik.  A promo or something.  Iron Sheik. 
[02:55:00]  Yes, sir.  Finally making his appearance back to the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you have to say about that?  Oh, I'm pleased.  Always.  Zenitha, Mountaineer.  I hope you'll meet me.  I'll be happy to be here.  Happy to be here.  Happy to be here.  And, of course, the Iron Sheik's representation of some reason.  He always brings his lawyer with him or something.  Yeah, that's real.  And they don't be asked for it.  E-S-S.  Exactly.  No.  Yeah.  Do you want me to punch him or are you going to punch him?  Oh, you're on our side?  That's good to know. 
[02:55:30]  I think we should all just kick him.  All right.  The demolition guy is on our side.  That's good to know.  Bushwagger, what side are you on?  Us?  Our side?  I'm on your side, mate.  You don't like Iron Sheik, right?  All the way.  All the way.  All the way.  I nigh, mate.  Let's finish up some old business, Iron Sheik.  Yes, Iron Sheik.  Last time you were here, you peed your pants.  And then you did a blog and yelled and screamed that you did not pee your pants.  So you want to set the record straight today?  Absolutely.  I didn't.  Just because my beard fell down and by accidently, I didn't pee my pants. 
[02:56:00]  It fell down your throat, into your bladder, and then out your penis.  Out your pee hole.  And how do you explain the wet spots slowly but surely getting bigger as the appearance  continued?  The wicking effect, Popey.  It was a wicking effect.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it spread out everything.  All right.  I want to get to the allegations.  All right.  Why don't you take that one in?  I just want to get to the allegations.  Well, now, who is making these allegations?  Brian Blair. 
[02:56:30]  You know Brian Blair, right?  Well, absolutely.  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Do you know what Brian Blair has said about you, sir?  Well, you know, many years.  What are you talking about?  I'm talking.  You want to talk?  Right.  No, you talk.  Oh.  Yeah.  We don't want to hear from the dumb lawyer.  We want to hear from our other guy.  Yeah.  You know, that guy, that douchebag.  Too many years are bothering me and all of his sons.  He come back with some kind of bullshit, talking.  But all intelligent, my wrestling friends and all the wrestlers, they know.  I grew up in the sport and my university, Minnesota. 
[02:57:00]  Although, I'm not kind of person to, he talked bad about me.  But, and I saw a story.  If he said something bad about me behind me, I can say, one day I go in the locker room,  I saw Hulk Hogan was behind him and wash his back and fuck his ass to make him humble.  So, and that, if you want to say that, I can say that one, too.  Right. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, you can say, well, I think we have a clip, don't we?  We sure do.  But, is he saying that Hulk Hogan fucked Brian Blair in the ass?  He said Hulk Hogan fucked Brian Blair in the ass.  Or make it perfectly good.  Absolutely, because all days, anywhere we go, we saw the name of the Hulk Hogan and Brian Blair  on the locker room.  Always they go same locker room.  Oh.  And I was Cincinnati, Ohio, and both of them go same room.  And after much, I saw that, and Hulk Hogan was behind him and killing his fucking boss 
[02:58:00]  and fuck his ass.  So, I mean, Dr. Bruni, douchebag, come, try to make a bad name about me.  I can say that one, too.  Wow.  Why don't we go around the room, Anthony?  Yeah.  Demolition, what do you think of those allegations that Hulk Hogan was fucking Brian Blair in the  locker room?  You know, that's unbelievable, but you can trust what the sheik says.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, the sheik's honest.  And bushwhacker?  I said, if a sheik says it, it's in the rock. 
[02:58:30]  That's it.  Yeah, okay.  That's it.  And the lawyer, is Iron Sheik being accurate about Hulk Hogan fucking Brian Blair in the  ass in the locker room?  What do you think?  I agree.  I wasn't there, but if the sheik said it, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you want to get to the audio.  Yeah, I would love to get to the audio now of what Brian Blair had said, the allegations  he's made against the Iron Sheik.  All right.  Listen closely.  Very strong, very strong, very strong, very horrible allegations, Iron Sheik, that he's  made against you.  That's why I say that douchebag many years probably tried to get even with me because 
[02:59:00]  our fucker's ass so bad, he gets so bigger and stinky, you know, tried to get even with  me.  Go ahead.  Okay.  All right.  Listen closely.  Listen close.  Here we go.  As the years went on, Cosgro would not stop.  I mean, the drugs, the steroids, the workouts, and then I found out that I could not believe  that he had a young boy, a ring boy in the room, a guy that wanted to be in the ring crew 
[02:59:30]  or something.  And I hear this.  At first, I smelled pot in the hallway, and I'm smelling this pot, and it leads me to the  door, and I'm listening, and I hear the Sheik's voice, and I hear this little, like a lower  tone voice, and Sheik molested this little kid in the room.  Wow.  Iron Sheik, how do you respond? 
[03:00:00]  He said you were molesting a young boy in a room after smoking marijuana in the same room.  You know, all my friends in pro wrestling, you know, since I'm America, I never do that  shit.  I'm a really religious man, honest man.  But that douchebag wants to get even with me, because everybody saw it in the Silverdome,  Pontiac, Michigan, 93,000 people.  I had him in the camel crash.  I was ready to break his back and fuck his ass, make him humble, hacksaw Jim Duggan, come 
[03:00:30]  save him, so I want to say, no, no, I want to say, if he's a man enough, and if he think  I'm like Michael Jackson, half and half, God bless Michael Jackson, he's gone, but I'm  surviving.  Anytime he think I'm half and half like Michael Jackson, he can bring his buddy, Hulk Hogan,  or Huxley Jim Duggan.  Anytime, anywhere, it's not too hard to find me.  And I'm going to bring Nicola, and I'm going to show the son of a piece of garbage, who 
[03:01:00]  is a real man, who is a half man.  He is absolutely, I saw him with Hulk Hogan, he's a half man, not me.  So he's, because of his sexual intercourse, his sodomy with Hulk Hogan, as you put it,  that makes him half man.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Okay, and the lawyer?  How could Brian Blair know what's going on through a door, staying on the other side  of the door?  I was thinking the same thing, it's like he heard some voices. 
[03:01:30]  Well, he smelled the marijuana, right?  That led him to the door.  But he heard voices.  He heard from the outside of the door, I guess, some type of noise, but yet he comes with this  thing saying that Sheik was doing some gay act, which, you know, if you know the Sheik,  you know, he ain't gay.  I think Brian Blair and the Sheik got to get together here and talk over this.  Yeah, yeah.  I think they should, uh, yeah.  Well, they got together at the roast last year, and you know what happened?  Sheik humbled them right at the roast.  You boom!  You cocked him in the ass?  I slap, uh, slap his face. 
[03:02:00]  I shoot.  I slap his fucking face until you get the, you get the message.  But, you know, as long as I cannot fuck his ass, better I had this fucking, slap his face  and he get the message.  But everybody know, I'm a real man, and I'm a grandfather, I'm a, you know, married man,  and that bullshit doesn't match me.  But he wanted to try to get even with me, and he make a new story about that.  But Brian Blair, anytime you think I'm a half man, you bring your buddy, Hulk Hogan, 
[03:02:30]  or Huxley, Jim Duggan, Aubrey, Nicola, anytime you want and steal, I can take you down, put  you in the camel cart, and fuck your ass, make you humble.  Have a good day.  Have a good day.  That's, uh, that's it.  All the, and all you were probably doing was probably teaching the ring boys some of your  moves, so there was a lot of grunting and groaning going on in the room, maybe.  Yeah.  Not really, no, because I didn't have, I didn't have, I didn't have, I can assure you, there's  nothing that goes on in the hotel, in the hotel rooms.  Oh, really? 
[03:03:00]  Trust me.  Well, uh, with that said, there's part two to the allegations here.  Oh, shit.  One more clip from Brian Blair.  All right.  Sheik's turned into a, uh, he's one of the guys that I will tell you that I think is,  uh, I'm not a good person.  Wow.  And not only did, uh, uh, I remember the first time when we were going to Australia,  Sheik, uh, had popcorn and, uh, walked through the thing and I'm going to sleep here, and 
[03:03:30]  all of a sudden I smelled something funny and they had crack rocks at the bottom of this  popcorn, uh, him and, uh, a deceased friend, good friend, uh, junkyard dog, God bless him.  And here, these guys are smoking crack on the airplane and I can't freaking believe this.  I mean, I really can't believe this.  Wow.  Now he's saying you smoked the crack there, uh, Iron Sheik.  That's a bunch of bullshit.  I have a lot of respect for my company to have floor, oversee. 
[03:04:00]  I don't do that stuff.  I just say, that guy is sick.  He tried to get even with me, make that bullshit story.  But, uh, all my wrestling friends, all my intelligent wrestling friends and all the boys,  they know I'm a man, 100%, not half and half.  No.  Not a half and half.  And not smoking a crack.  Absolutely.  No crack, no crack.  No, no, no.  Drugs, no crack, boys' ass, nothing.  That doesn't match the All-American A, U.S.  No.  When University of Minnesota coach, that doesn't match me. 
[03:04:30]  I need to try to make a bullshit story to maybe get a sympathy with people, but that  doesn't work.  Brown Blair, still your fucking jabroni douchebag, anytime you want, like I said, I bring  Nikola, you bring your buddy Hulk Hogan, and we're going to find out who's a half and  half.  Now, uh, gentlemen, um, you see, the, the Sheik, just always in some kind of fucking  conflict with, with other people, um, from the past and everything, like he's, the Sheik 
[03:05:00]  won't let shit from 92 go, you know, from like the 90s, early 90s and 80s and stuff.  You guys hold any grudges with any, uh, people?  I can't say I do at all.  No?  I get along with everybody.  Yeah, see that?  Look at that.  He has a nice guy.  I love you guys in the show.  Iron Sheik just talks about what a nice guy he is, but he's constantly fucking people in  the ass, and you're just sitting there going, I ain't got no problem with anyone.  I had a great career.  This is fun.  You know?  It's an easier way to live, right?  Exactly. 
[03:05:30]  Having no problems with anyone.  Yeah.  And then, and Iron Sheik, there's allegations of smoking crack.  Oh my God.  Oh, it's a controversy.  Never.  This is just a bullshit he made it.  Bullshit.  Exactly.  But he's a politician.  Why would he say something like that?  Yeah, what kind of fucking politician is to be?  He beat the fuck on his son if you have to go in the jail.  You call him as a politician, man?  Well, there are rumors that he might have, you know, did some things with his sons.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Was it proven to be true?  Because I, I, I heard the rumors.  You said to Derek, what happened to his son?  You can't say it better than me about that. 
[03:06:00]  He was accused of, you know, beating up his son because his son came in late or something  and then, whatever.  So, uh, he hit his skid, you know, child abuse type thing.  Well, you know, there's, there's different levels of that.  If you just give him a little smack, it's called discipline.  In this, in today's generation, uh, you know, that can, you know, that can have your  kids taken away from you.  Really?  What about fucking in the ass?  Like the Iron Sheik?  Hmm.  Well, some people deserve that, but, uh, you know.  That's the Iron Sheik. 
[03:06:30]  Some people deserve to be humbled, you know.  The Iron Sheik is always humbling people.  Where's the rock?  We're supposed to plug the beer that Iron Sheik is drinking today.  What, what is Iron Sheik going to drink?  I think it's drinking, uh, Bex.  Wonderful Bex.  Well, why don't you do the commercial for Bex there, Iron Sheik?  Well, you know, I've been in Germany, been wrestling many times over there.  One of the best beer I had in Germany, Bex and Polyger, and it's excellent beer from, uh, Germany.  I like it.  You like it, all right.  Yes, sir.  All right, just don't pee your pants today, please.  Oh, no, not today.  Not today? 
[03:07:00]  You're all right today?  That's only a tenth beer so far this morning.  Yes, sir.  And of course, you have tons of pictures that, uh, E-Rock's bothering him to sign, uh,  to, uh, you know, to showcase everything, you know.  Yeah, of course.  You know, his big mark-out moment, but that's okay.  We take care of our wrestling fans.  It was a great moment when he peed his pants and we all got to mock it.  Hey, Iron Sheik, moving on to other things.  Captain Lou Albano, one of the greats, just passed a couple days ago.  And I do believe, if I remember my wrestling history, he, uh, I think he managed the Iron Sheik for a little bit, right? 
[03:07:30]  He, absolutely, many years, one of the greatest managers, him, and also my manager, Mr. Fred Blassie, their good friend.  Classy.  Classy Fred Blassie.  Yes.  My, my manager, I was his first champion, uh, WWE.  And, uh, but, um, Captain Lou was a good man.  God bless him.  I get along with him.  And he was a funny man.  And he tell the story over and over and over many times. 
[03:08:00]  He was a good man.  God bless you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great loss.  Another one, you know, so many.  Exactly.  So many wrestlers dying of natural causes.  It's just amazing.  Yeah.  Okay.  What?  I said okay.  Captain Lou was fun.  Yeah.  We like the golden era of the managers is gone, you know?  And he was Mario.  Did you like the, uh, the rubber band thing he, he sported there on his cheek?  Yeah, he was a, I like him.  He was a good man.  He was a character. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, a good wrestler.  Yeah, I'm going to, I'll get along with him.  The managers were good back then.  I mean, they were always jumping in and fucking around with the, the match.  No one ever saw it.  No, they never saw it there.  Uh, never saw the, the, the sand in the eyes or the chair in the back of the head.  Here's another one.  Here's another one.  Mr. Fuji.  Now, Mr. Fuji.  He had a box of tricks at Fuji.  I can tell a lot of stories about Fuji.  Yeah, but Fuji never cheated.  Never cheated.  Never cheated.  Never cheated.  Oh, he never, he never got caught.  Never threw salt.  No, he never got caught. 
[03:09:00]  It's like, oh my God, there's salt in his eyes again.  And it's like, why isn't anybody looking?  Any good rich stories on, uh, Fuji?  I can tell you one back in Puerto Rico with, with a guy called Luke Graham back in the seventies.  He got, um, Luke, lick it up.  Luke passed out, dropped it.  He dropped acid at him, took him to a tattooist, got a tattoo on his arm while he was out, and  then took him to the airport to pick up his wife.  And he had another girl's name on his, how's that?  That was just one of, one of Fuji. 
[03:09:30]  Another one, a car was parked outside and he had a bit of trouble with this guy in the  dress room.  This is, this is a, this is the, uh, God's honest truth.  The guy was getting smart.  He had people come and take the guy's car engine out.  The guy come out to start his car, went and lifted the hood up.  No engine.  No engine.  No engine.  What a smart ass.  Yeah.  Fuji's, Fuji's ribs were a bit.  Well, he's a prankster, right?  A bit of a prankster.  What are you guys, uh, what are you guys doing in, uh, in town? 
[03:10:00]  Uh, we're in, we're in town, uh, today, Saturday and Sunday.  It's the big Apple wizard world convention.  It's over at the pier 94.  That's 55th and 12th Avenue over here in, uh, New York city.  Um, it's a big, uh, pop culture convention going on, uh, this weekend.  Very cool.  Hanging out there signing autographs and stuff.  All weekend.  Today, tomorrow, and Sunday.  Nice.  A lot of fans come up there.  Want to see the Iron Sheik.  Well, and also these two.  And I've been, of course, I've been saying demolition guy.  Cause I don't know if it's act smash or smash. 
[03:10:30]  It is smash.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  It is smash.  One of the demolition guys.  Uh, Iron Sheik.  I'm going to name some other wrestlers.  I just want your opinion on them.  Okay.  Uh, we'll start with Razor Ramon.  That's Scott Hall.  Scott Hall.  Right.  Oh, that fucking job.  Ronny Terati is still the show in, in, in my roast.  And he was so fucked up with, uh, with drinking and, uh, hard stuff, whatever.  And, uh, uh, and it was, uh, another day I was really sick about him because, um, he was 
[03:11:00]  so fucked up.  Terati is still the show, but you know, uh, you tell him what happened.  Yeah, he got, he got drunk at the, at the, at the, at the, at the, at the last one, you  know, uh, one of the comedians was doing his, uh, his bit and he said, he made a comment 
[03:11:30]  about Owen Hart and they took, you know, Scott Hall being drunk and took it to heart  and almost beat the shit out of the comedian and, uh, had to have a bunch of security guys,  uh, try to control him, you know, you know, but if my, if our personal head of security  was there, that none of that would have happened.  I'd see that big guy in the corner over there.  Yeah.  He hasn't cracked a smile yet.  No, he doesn't.  And he just, you know, he, yeah, he does what he does, you know, he just stays there.  Yeah.  I understand.  He's an iron chic and eyes are head of security over here, you know?  All right.  When we move on to the next name, I don't think you've ever expressed, um, what do you think 
[03:12:00]  of this next wrestler, Hulk Hogan?  Well, you know, I don't have to say everybody, you know, in America, who was a champion before  Hulk Hogan, iron chic and, um, if he wasn't not from chief of the WWF, Mr. McMahon, senior  and junior, he never can be the iron chic money talk, money walk.  So, and, uh, I lost my back to him.  Uh, I lost the bullshit coming.  Yeah, exactly.  So, so anyway. 
[03:12:30]  Hulk Hogan is, um, another guy, a staffer, you can't trust him and, uh, uh, you know,  he's, uh.  We're upset that he didn't invite you on the Australia tour coming up, the big Hulkamania  Australia tour coming up next month.  Uh, you know, he should have invited the iron chic to go to the, go on the big Australia  tour with, uh, with him.  Absolutely.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, the Hulk trying to, uh, get some money that his wife took from him, maybe?  Well, probably, you know, you have a lot of, uh, he's fucked up worst in our 
[03:13:00]  chic, no.  The divorce is final now.  Jesus.  Wow.  Were you, were you, uh, did you see any of the reality show there, uh, chic, where he  was, uh, getting into all kinds of jams with his wife and everything?  Not really.  I don't, I don't talk about his wife too much, but, uh.  What about that fucking, uh, well, cause it was on TV.  It's not like, you know, we're talking about a, I don't think chic watch the, doesn't watch  the reality TV, so I don't, I don't, no, I don't think so. 
[03:13:30]  You didn't see the wife fucking the 22 year old guy or whatever?  Yeah, I think his wife might get more hit than Hulk.  Yeah, the house boy.  Ah, the house boy.  Nice.  Absolutely.  All right, that's what he's got on Hulk.  What about, uh, I don't know, the ultimate warrior, Iron Sheik?  Well, he's, uh, another fucking, uh, jackass and, uh, gay son of a bitch.  Embarrassing for the WWE or WWF to be part of, um, uh, wrestling, uh, sport and, you know,  the guy goes, uh, fuck somebody and, uh, somebody fuck his ass for money, uh, and it's 
[03:14:00]  embarrassing for the, uh, Bushwacker is embarrassing for the demolition to, I can't  be same locker room with that fucking piece of garbage, low-life cocksuckers, so fuck  him.  He, I mean, embarrassing for my business.  Embarrassing.  Exactly.  Well, Bushwacker's nodding his head.  Bushwacker, you got anything on the ultimate warrior?  Sheik said it all.  How can I, how can I better that?  Out of your head, to something like that. 
[03:14:30]  All right.  Sheik, were you alleging that perhaps, uh, the ultimate warrior would, uh, take money  in exchange for people putting their penis in his asshole?  He's looking at his lawyer.  An old-day sucker.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  All right.  That's what the Sheik say.  We don't know.  How about, uh, Macho Man Randy Savage?  Oh, Macho, go ahead.  Sorry.  Macho Man is, um, uh, I don't know. 
[03:15:00]  God bless Elizabeth, but he's another, uh, Jew jabroni, watch the money, and, uh, you  can't trust him too much.  And, uh, but, uh, but he's not gay.  He's not gay.  He's a good man.  At least he's not gay.  Right.  Exactly.  He's a good man.  I have a lot of respect for, uh, Macho Savi, better than that fucking Arthur.  What?  Yeah.  What about, uh, uh, Jesse Ventura?  Oh, yeah.  What do you think about him?  Jesse Ventura is a good friend of mine, and a governor, yeah, governor of the... 
[03:15:30]  Well, not anymore.  Not anymore.  But he's the...  What do you think, the Iron Pole is still in charge of Iran, too?  He's a good man, and, uh, I know him since I was in Minnesota.  Yeah.  And he made it, and he's all right.  He's at least not, uh, awful warrior.  Exactly.  Not gay.  No gay.  He's a good man.  Uh, I get along with Jesse.  His last match, as a matter of fact, was California, and he had a heart problem.  He didn't go in the ring, but, uh, Jesse used the brain.  He's a good talker, very smart man. 
[03:16:00]  I have a lot of respect for Jesse the body.  Wow, look at that.  You're not going to see that a lot out of this, Sheik.  No.  Who else do you have a problem with, then, Iron Sheik?  Do we cover them all?  Well, not really.  I don't, I don't have any problem with none of them, except that fucking douchebag,  Brian Blair.  He wants to get even with me, you know?  After many years, I fucked his ass.  His ass is so big and it's stinky.  No, I get a very, and I get a very, no.  No, he missed me, I imagine.  So I go back, he gets him, fuck his ass, make him humble. 
[03:16:30]  But no, no more again.  Enough is enough.  Enough is enough.  All right.  Exactly.  Does he have any other problems with wrestlers, Warrior?  Uh, no, just, uh, Scott Hall, Ultimate Warrior, Hogan, Blair.  Uh, I think, what about Rowdy, uh, what about?  Rowdy, Rowdy, Piper.  Oh, no, Rowdy, Rowdy.  Here, we have it right here.  The, uh, the loser gets humbled, old country way match.  All his, uh, nemesis are right, right here, here.  Yeah.  Yeah, get that on the camera over there.  Exactly.  Get that.  Are you still wrestling there, Iron Sheik?  No, I'm not wrestling only for the autograph section. 
[03:17:00]  But if I have to wrestling with them, uh, Bram Blair and Hulk Hogan, yeah, I'm, I bring them, Nikola Volkov and myself, 30 minutes, I'm the one, I'm ready.  He can go talk to the Kennedy McMinn, some, uh, some country, no problem.  Mm-hmm.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Hey, Bobo, you got a question for the Iron Sheik?  Oh, Bobo.  Getting ready to wrap up here, but, uh.  Yeah, I got, I got a question, Sheik.  How, how do you think you'd fare if you were around in today's age of, today's day and age of wrestling? 
[03:17:30]  How would you fare today?  Today, what I'm thinking about new generation, what are you talking about?  What?  No.  Bobo, rephrase your question.  How would you fare today?  I think he'd do absolutely great.  Hey, lawyer, shut the fuck up.  Yeah, lawyer, what are you, ruining the bit?  We smell a bit here.  Right.  We got, we got one moron over here who can't tell a question.  Yeah.  An Iron Sheik who can't understand this, this, uh, idiot. 
[03:18:00]  Read the room.  Read the room.  Yeah, still if I won, I can wrap the knee and I go in the ring with the tag team, my tag team championship with my partner.  Oh, I think.  And no problem.  I guess what Bobo was saying is, if you, if you were wrestling today, who would you want to fuck in the ass?  Probably, uh, Brian Blair before Hulk Hogan.  No, no, some of the new wrestlers.  Who do you have a problem with?  Oh, the new wrestlers, along with all of them, they're good people.  Good people.  As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, I was, uh, last week in the, um, Smackdown in the Boston, Massachusetts, all the new generation. 
[03:18:30]  Good people, hard worker, uh, and, um, but I leave it to the, my wrestling friends, they can decide who's a, who's a good or who's bad.  But it's, uh, the, the, the way they respect me on the, uh, building, uh, I respect all of them.  That's because I wear the t-shirt and I have a lot of respect for the new generation.  Well, we're getting a lot of questions coming in, Iron Sheik.  Eric, uh, writes, Iron Sheik wants to fuck all these guys in the ass and they're the gay ones. 
[03:19:00]  Very confused by that.  You're calling everyone gay, but you're also saying how you fucked everyone in the ass.  Well, to humble them.  That's with a, uh, beer bottle, not literally fuck them in the ass.  Well, no, he, but it's, it's just, it's to humble them, Opie.  Yeah.  Uh, Big A.  Not doing it out of gayness.  Iron Sheik, this is Big A. He's a big wrestling fan.  He wants to ask you a question as well.  Here's, uh, Big A.  Big A, grab the mic and talk to Iron Sheik.  Oh.  Actually, I'm curious. 
[03:19:30]  In your opinion, which was the, the best, uh, match, uh, you were ever in?  The best match?  Yes.  The best match you were in?  This guy's going to be perfect for the wrestling business.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What a fucking character this guy is.  He would be, he would be perfect right in front of a fucking camera fucking.  He wrestles with the English language.  You guys don't recognize Paul Bearer?  We brought him back to you guys. 
[03:20:00]  Paul Bearer.  We found him.  Here he is.  Percy.  What a, what a, what a cartoon character he is.  Jesus Christ.  You know.  Paul Bearer.  Remember that guy?  Jesus Christ.  I just like him.  He's got another question.  Oh, you got another question?  Big A.  Okay, yes.  Yeah.  I, she, who's your favorite, uh, super, uh, super, uh, super, uh, super, uh, super. 
[03:20:30]  Wait, wait.  Can you start over, Big A?  I was a little confused there.  Can you shake a little bit more?  Please.  Big A, start over.  Can you not shit your pants while you're trying to ask a question?  Please?  Okay.  Big A will fucking smother you to death.  We're going to have a problem in here.  Do you see the guy standing behind you?  We're going to have a problem in here.  There ain't going to, there's nothing going to happen here.  Oh, shit.  That guy's pretty hardcore right there.  Does he ever smile?  No.  No, I don't allow him to.  It's not in a job, it's not in a job description.  I see you brought some heat. 
[03:21:00]  It's our, it's our head of security, you know, we have to keep, uh, yeah, you know,  keep the, you know, keep us, uh, protected at all times.  Big A, let's go.  Wallace Wallace.  He's still not smiling.  No.  Jesus.  Big A, once again, what's the question for the Iron Sheik?  I'd like to know his favorite superstar in wrestling.  Oh.  Who's your favorite superstar in wrestling?  Well, uh, you're talking about old-timer, was a soldier, a soldier, was a great performer, 
[03:21:30]  Mr. Bob Buckland, six years, nobody beat him up in the garden, that was good.  And, uh, very few, but, uh, for sure, soldier, the slaughter, and, um, I have a lot of them,  the Malaysian, and the Bushwager, they're all my good buddies and good friends.  I get along with most of them.  All right.  And I'm, I'm hearing Iron Sheik that you're getting back together with your wife.  What's that about?  Well, you know, I mean, uh, one year, uh, one year, uh, I was, uh, by myself because  she has to, there are two hours every day to go for her job, but now she can get back 
[03:22:00]  again and we're together, everything is okay now.  What was the problem with him and his wife there?  The problem, her job was, uh, too far from the, the hustle I had, and, uh, she, uh, moved  from me, and now, uh, she's coming back again and we're together and he's okay.  I bet she just didn't like that you were fucking so many stinky asses.  Not really, not.  To humble, to humble them. 
[03:22:30]  Now that the Sheik has gotten somewhat control of his, uh, demons, uh, she's got them, she's  got them back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Demons, huh?  He's, Iron Sheik's really trying to clean up there, huh?  He's, uh, it's the best I've seen him.  No more crack cocaine.  Oh, so you're admitting he did a little crack cocaine.  No, he admits that he does it.  He admits that he does it, but anybody in the wrestling business knows what the Iron Sheik  is about, but, uh, we don't have to go there.  We don't have to go there.  Okay.  All right.  No.  And, uh, what do you think if I ran there? 
[03:23:00]  Well, you don't know, uh, I haven't been home a long time, 45 years, but, uh, things  have changed a bit.  Everything completely changed compared to the old days.  Yes.  A little bit.  Yeah, that damn, uh, president, uh, you know, got a problem with the Iranian president,  uh, not acknowledging the, uh, Holocaust there.  That's, uh, not cool.  That's not cool, right?  That's not cool for us, uh, Jewish people.  It's not, uh, not...  You're Jewish?  Yes.  Huh.  Bobo, one more question?  Bobo's got another question.  Bobo's got another question. 
[03:23:30]  He keeps raising his hand, so he's figuring we get one more.  What's up there, Bobo?  Go ahead, Bobo.  Well, the, well, the other question, well, the other question I, I have, I have to ask...  Could you repeat that, please?  You know, we, we should have a penis off, because Bobo's hung, too, like the Iron Sheik.  The Iron Sheik will not be dropping his pants on this, on this, uh, edition.  What if we turn off all the cameras?  Because Bobo's saying that he has a bigger penis than the Iron Sheik, and we all know...  How big is your penis, Iron Sheik?  If Bobo wants to do it, that's fine.  The Iron Sheik is not, is not dropping his pants yet.  How big is your penis, Iron Sheik? 
[03:24:00]  Probably between 10 to 11.  10 to 11 inches?  Right.  But he's not, he's not going to, uh, he's not going to show it today, no.  Uh, Bobo, you better show that tremendous penis of yours.  Iron Sheik, I know you're not gay, but you've got to see what this Bobo is packing.  You're not going to believe this one.  You're not going to believe this.  Bobo.  Wait.  Wait, wait, show the Iron Sheik.  All right, hold on a minute.  Here's the bigger...  Come over here and...  I have to get my photographer ready for this, so, uh...  Could someone get, uh, Bobo on mic as he shows the Iron Sheik, what he's packing? 
[03:24:30]  You've never seen a bigger one in your life there, Iron Sheik.  Not that we actually want to look at this, but, uh...  Jesus Christ, I'm going to go fucking blind here.  Why?  Jesus fucking...  All right, here we go.  This is Bobo showing what he's packing, right?  Iron Sheik, you're into this, huh?  We need a girl in here right now.  Iron Sheik, you're into this?  This is too much of a...  This is too gay right now.  Yeah, exactly.  This is too much of a...  All right, Bobo's pulling us about this.  Better shoot Bram Belair, bro. 
[03:25:00]  All right, Iron Sheik.  He might like that.  Iron Sheik, you comment on what you're seeing here.  This is the biggest penis you're ever going to see.  Yes.  Too fucking much.  Iron Sheik's laughing.  Yeah, Bobo, down.  Yeah, down, down.  I want Iron Sheik to describe what he's seeing here.  Can you speak correctly?  Oh, Bobo, don't take that shit.  Bobo, keep the pants down.  Keep the pants down and don't take that shit from him.  Bobo, give him some of your business.  Yeah, they want you to put your pants by your ankle, so...  Yeah, yeah.  And stand closer together instead of spread out there. 
[03:25:30]  All right.  Yeah, better balance there.  Here goes Bobo pulling his pants down.  Iron Sheik, describe...  They're trying to get you to go lower.  And look at them, too.  Let them...  No, we've seen that.  We've seen that.  Iron Sheik, what are you looking at?  What are you looking at?  You don't have a shit stain in your underwear there.  What the fuck?  Not that I'm looking, but that...  Jesus fucking Christ.  Iron Sheik, what are you looking at?  Oh, I think like you said, Jesus fucking Christ.  Put your pants back and embarrass you, Bobo.  Oh, I'm an ant. 
[03:26:00]  Jesus Christ.  Put your pants up.  You embarrass yourself.  Deeper amber, I'd like that from you.  My pinky is bigger.  Jesus.  Well, you know what?  He's got a bigger cock than the Iron Sheik, so I'll tell you that much.  Oh, I don't know.  Iron Sheik's packing at 11.  I don't know.  I don't know about...  No, no, no, no.  What?  I don't know about that.  I'm not packing so much thanks to all the surgeries.  I think it may have affected that.  What surgeries did you have?  Urinary system operation.  How many? 
[03:26:30]  Why?  48.  They messed up an operation.  There was an infection from an operation they messed up.  How many surgeries did you have?  It was 48.  All because of one infection, because they left it open too long.  Did it go to your brain?  48 surgeries.  Fuck.  It may have gone a little bit.  Yes, I can see.  What do you guys think?  The other guys.  What do you think?  I think they're in shock.  Are you in shock?  Yeah, I'm in shock, right?  I tell you, I live a sheltered life.  Yeah, there's no need.  Yeah, and I'm from down under.  Bushwacker Lucas' back turned to the guy, you know? 
[03:27:00]  I mean, I mean, Bushwacker Lucas' back turned to me.  I should be scared of that one, shouldn't I?  Whoa!  Whoa!  Yeah!  When the boy's back turns his back, you know there's a problem.  Hey, mate, there's a little sheep shag in there.  Jesus Christ.  All right, well, I think we did it all here, man.  One more.  We've got to do another plug here.  Of course, of course, of course.  October 16th to 18th.  That's today, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Big Apple Wizard World Convention.

Thank you.  Yes, thank you.  How old?  41.  Jesus.  Wow, what are you doing?  Yes, I'm old. 
[03:28:00]  Been a tough old fucking life, haven't I?  You look 60.  With the Iron Sheik for 20 years?  No kidding.  Yes.  Yeah, what the fuck?  No kidding.  The Iron Sheik's draining your youth.  Beam the foot of justice.  Beam the foot, please.  No kidding.  He's draining your youth.  No kidding, yeah.  Being the fall back for the Iron Sheik for 20 years, it does that to you.  When did you say goodbye to the hair?  What age?  What was the Iron Sheik doing?  About 20 years ago, maybe?  What was the Iron Sheik doing when all your hair fell out in like one day?  With the Iron Sheik, yeah, your hair has to fall out.  Hey, Sheik was making him humble. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, fuck.  Whoa.  We were in a town last night together, and every other time you come in here, I...  Are you going to fuck him in the ass for his birthday, Iron Sheik?  No, no, no.  You said that last time that you would fuck him in the ass.  You know, I love that beer, that Bex beer bottle.  But drink it, yes, no.  No, I'm engaged, so don't go that direction.  She likes a little beer.  I enjoy a morning beer every so often.  It's usually after I've been up the whole night.  Yeah.  You know, it's hard to wake up and then, you know, crack a beer at 10 in the morning. 
[03:29:00]  All right.  Sam, you're not going to get your head licked, which sucks.  Yeah, I don't think so.  Can't you lick his head?  Lick his head, Luke.  Luke.  Give him a good licking.  Yeah.  Luke the bushwhacker.  Come on.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Hang on a minute, guys.  And here goes Sam.  Sam's going to get his head licked by...  And if anybody else wants to get their head licked, it's the Big Apple Wizard World Convention. 
[03:29:30]  Pyramine...  Pyramine is fire!  You can't get it together.  Am I silent for a second?  Todd Corgan will lick the head of your cock.  That's what they lick the head of the cock.  Bobo?  Bobo?  Yeah, Bobo?  What's up?  Any final thoughts?  Bobo, the bushwhacker's doing some licking now.  Bobo, come get licking.  Bushwhacker's doing...  But keep your pants on, dang it!  I'm not going down the south!  Keep your pants on!  No, no, no!  Keep your pants on!  Don't worry, I normally keep them on, all right? 
[03:30:00]  Yeah!  Normally.  Listen, listen, don't turn your back to the bushwhacker, please.  You want to get licked?  Don't give him any ideas.  Bobo wants to get licked.  I'm going to be an honor for this one, Mike.  All right.  My friend would be jealous.  I went to...  All right, Luke is going to lick Bobo.  Hey, mate, when did he last wash?  When did you shower?  Four days ago, maybe?  No, I showered this morning, but earlier I rushed out of the bathroom.  It was a bathroom that had a shortage of toilet paper.  Oh, that's why the shit's staying?  Where do you find these papers?  We call that dad when it takes an open cheap glass. 
[03:30:30]  No, it was a bathroom in a train station, all right?  Did Eric and Lloyd just say, where do you find these people?  Jesus Christ, who are you hanging with?  It's the same shit.  It's the same shit.  You see the wrestling fans sometimes?  I've been swore with you.  Yes, people who live in glass houses not only shouldn't throw stones, but should get dressed in the basement.  Oh, Jesus.  It was a bathroom I went to in a train station, and there was a shortage of toilet paper, as you would expect, in a subway station bathroom.  So you've got swamp ass right now? 
[03:31:00]  Swamp ass.  It doesn't look like that.  Yeah.  When the bush rack is starting to move away from you, you know they've got a problem there.  I don't know if Luke wants to lick you, Bubba.  I don't think so, you know.  I don't think it's going to happen.  Oh, that penis head of yours.  Yeah.  He's packing, isn't he, Luke?  Ah, packing.  He packed and left.  All right.  Well, I might have to see if that whole Dr. Steve theory that Dr. Steve has actually works. 
[03:31:30]  What's that?  No, I heard that theory that if you lose, like, a certain amount of weight, it can actually get bigger.  I wonder if you lose enough, I can get to five inches.  You could five inches.  You could lose as much weight as you can read.  You should never have a night.  All right.  You should hope for three.  You could weigh as much as Karen Carpenter, and you're still not going to get any bigger.  Sorry to say.  Maybe a penis pump.  You're going to still be hung like an acorn.  Yeah.  Archie, any other thoughts?  Did we do it?  Oh, I'm happy if you did see you guys again. 
[03:32:00]  Very happy.  Pleasure.  I hope I see you guys again in the future.  Pleasure for me.  Are you guys coming to the Big Apple Wizard World Convention today over at the Pier 94?  Wouldn't miss it.  I didn't think you would.  Wouldn't miss it.  Yeah, we'll be.  You're going down there with Sam.  Yes.  Sam is a giant fan, too.  Sam, you didn't ask any questions.  You're the big wrestling guy.  We covered it all with Archie.  Sam at every wrestling convention in the area.  Of course you do.  Every, everywhere we go.  He wants to be humbled someday.  No, I'm not hoping. 
[03:32:30]  You don't want to be humbled?  I take care of Sam at all the conventions.  Even at the Big Apple, next week at the Legends of the Ring wrestling convention.  I love how he humbles people.  It's the best.  I don't think I'm being humbled.  I'm just going to ask.  I'm going to get a camel clutch or nothing from Archie.  I'm just going to ask her.  We're lazy.  You don't want to be put in the camel clutch here.  No, no, no, no, no, not today.  No, you don't want to be put in the camel clutch here.  What do you mean not today?  When are we supposed to do this?  No, someone wants to get put in the camel clutch here.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Who got put in it last time?  I did.  Who wants to go in at this time?  Bobo!  Bobo.  No, no.  E-Rock, you want to get camel clutch this time? 
[03:33:00]  How about Iron Cheek?  Let's say him.  I don't want Iron Cheek touching Bobo, please.  No.  How about Sam lays across his lap and Iron Cheek spanks him?  No.  That's not a good idea.  What happened with that?  Because there's no wrestling.  He likes little boys.  E-Rock, you want to be camel clutched?  I'll do it.  Come over here.  All right.  E-Rock, you want to be camel clutched?  We'll do a camel clutch.  And then, Sam, you've got to have a real question.  No, I'm not going to do it.  You're the Iron Cheek.  You're the master of the camel clutch.  Nobody wants to see me put anybody in a camel clutch.  Everybody wants to see you put me in a camel clutch. 
[03:33:30]  It's not going to happen.  I don't know.  How come E-Rock gets embarrassed when he can't think of a punchline,  but he's volunteering to get camel clutched?  I know.  Go on your hands and knees, but don't face Bobo, because she's, you know,  This is not how it's done.  Nice and easy.  Well, at this stage of the Iron Cheek's game, this is how it's done.  Oh, he's humbling him.  All right.  He's humbling him.  Nice and easy.  Break his back.  Yeah, there it is.  Break his back.  Wow, I remember that one.  Yep.  He doesn't know what to do.  He was in the camel clutch. 
[03:34:00]  Once you're in that, it's over.  Exactly.  Thanks again, everybody.  Have a good day.  Thank you, Iron Cheek.  All right, the Big Apple Wizard World Convention, Pier 94, 55th and 12th Avenue,  the demolition, Bushwacker Luke, the Iron Sheek, and a bunch more.  So show up.  Hey, you guys got a great show here.  Thanks for having us on.  Thank you, sir.  It's a pleasure having you on.  Absolutely.  The Iron Sheek demolition, the Bushwacker, or any of the legends.  I was going to say, oh, my God.  The Iron Sheek is getting ready to leave. 
[03:34:30]  Great to be here.  Have a good day, mates.  All right, Luke, can you lead everyone out with that famous walk of yours down the hall?  We're going to film that.  Thank you, sir.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  All right, open the door.  Get the curtains open.  We want to see Luke.  Thank you so much.  Lead this gang out of the studio with the famous walk.  There he goes with the walk.  All right, there they go as they leave.  Gentlemen, always a pleasure.  Sir, security guy, thank you. 
[03:35:00]  Very intimidating.  I know you're intimidating, but you can smile at once.  Oh, look at Luke walking.  Oh, he just licked Bobo.  Oh, this is crazy.  He's going down the hall.  Look at him.  Oh, it's like 1987 all over here.  And then he does stuff.  Look at him working the camera.  He's working the camera.  Thank you, Eric, the lawyer.  Take it easy.  Thanks for ruining another fine appearance by the Iron Sheek.  I heard that.  Oh, sorry.  And there they go, walking slowly but surely.  Oh, what a fucking mess.  What?  What a clusterfuck. 
[03:35:30]  That whole scene.  I don't even know what the fuck that was.  Holy shit.  Yes, Z-Rock.  That is gold.  Oh, you're just going up.  All right.  How do you even explain that?  I don't know.  It's just fucking...  Oh, my God.  I remember watching the...  Like, I remember watching those guys in their prime.  What does Sam got?  What's that?  And then it's like...  I was just watching him.  He did the walk and he did the...  Oh, he went right into the camera. 
[03:36:00]  Just like I was...  I felt like I was a kid watching television again.  Yeah, because you're looking through the viewfinder.  Yeah.  It was like the TV when he walks up and goes...  He used to do that to television cameras and now he's doing it to actually your old camcorder.  The camcorder, which is now used for the studio camera.  Very nice.  He talks a good game considering he walks with a cane.  Well, the cane, he probably doesn't need it.  It's probably to stretch out the assholes before he humbles people.  For a guy that says he's not getting there, he does a lot of ass-fucking. 
[03:36:30]  He loves just fucking his enemies and their assholes.  And then he's accusing Hulk Hogan of fucking some fucking guy in the ass.  Jesus.  I had no idea that B. Brian Blair from the Killer Bs was, not could have been, was...  Was.  ...fucked in the ass by Hulk Hogan.  By Hulk Hogan, according to the Sheik.  According.  We have to say allegedly a lot to him.  Well, no, according to the Sheik.  According to him.  It happened.  Yeah.  A lot of late-breaking news on the show that I fucking...  That guy... 
[03:37:00]  And there was something else that came out of that segment.  Brooklyn Ace, what do you got?  You're talking for a lot of people right now.  Good morning, boys.  Uh, Bobo, do you realize how sick you could get from shitting in a public restroom?  A subway restroom?  What are you doing shitting in a subway bathroom, Bobo?  Everyone knows you're shit before you leave the house if you have nowhere else to shit.  Well, I did leave the house, but I drank a lot of water.  And you shit?  And you shit?  What are you, a bird?  No, no, no.  Comes out all in one fucking lump? 
[03:37:30]  No, I just ate something that must have caused it.  I ate something that must have caused it.  It gave me a tummy ache and I couldn't see through my glasses.  And my ass neck hurt.  Have a good weekend, boys.  Thank you, sir.  Take it easy.  Maybe he ate some bad piss clams.  Yes.  Some bad piss clams.  Ugh.  All right, get all the plugs in.  I can't see, goddammit.  Goddammit.  Bobo, you gotta trim that fucking nostril hair. 
[03:38:00]  It is hanging out of your fucking nose.  Do you know your nostril hair hangs out of your nostrils?  There's the mic over there.  The mic is over here.  Come here.  Come here.  What's going on with your nose hairs?  Don't you look in the mirror?  I wait for it to get a certain amount of length.  This way it can easily be cut.  Because I use one of those small metal scissors.  No, no.  It's not supposed to come out of your nose before you cut it.  Look at it.  You have hair coming out of your fucking nose. 
[03:38:30]  Well, it's easier to see it when you're trying to cut it.  You're trying to see what you're cutting.  If it's too long, it is easier to see.  Jesus Christ.  He makes perfect sense.  Yeah.  Once you can see it, then he can see it.  Then he can see it.  Of course.  Why didn't you clip it then in the subway bathroom while you're taking a shit?  No, I didn't do that in the subway bathroom.  How did you take a shit knowing there was no toilet paper?  Well, there was, but there wasn't enough.  Wait a minute.  A messy one.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[03:39:00]  How was there not enough?  How did...  Didn't you look and say, you know, I need a certain amount of paper?  Sometimes I'm not...  I'm not sure how much I'm going to need.  Like, I'll go to a certain amount, and then if I need more, I'll go to...  I'll get more...  I'll take more.  So it was messy, and you left a big skid mark there?  Yeah, unfortunately, yeah.  Unfortunately?  Yeah.  Yeah, that sucks.  I'm sorry to hear that, Bobo.  Go clean up.  All right.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  It's Friday, and...  Yeah. 
[03:39:30]  And that's about the only reason I need to get the fuck out of here.  I was able to get one of the videos up, Big A and Bobo doing the abortion story.  Oh, yeah.  And then the fucking Balloon Boy story with Big A will be up later on my YouTube channel,  OP Radio.  I think the first one's up there, if it worked.  Holy fuck, I'm exhausted from today.  Did that Iron Sheik thing sound like anything?  Ah, it's hysterical.  That fucking Sheik, when he's just fucking people and their assholes. 
[03:40:00]  It's astounding to me.  Love it.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Love it.  I think we did it all.  Yeah, we did.  Thanks for checking us out this week, guys.  We'll see you Monday.  Enjoy your weekend.  I don't know.  I might be at FH Riley's.  That's my plug.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  Maybe tomorrow night.  Probably the Islander game.  The Compound Bar.  Compound Bar.  Nice.  I'll be hanging.  All right.  Sam, any plugs?  Just a Comic-Con.  Special deliveries next week.  Okay. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, but you're doing interviews down there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to interview...  Believe it or not, I just booked an interview with the Iron Sheik.  No way.  Wow.  I wonder what he's going to say.  Really?  And Demolition.  Wow.  Who was the security guy?  He looked like he might have been an old wrestler.  Hey, look, his name...  He wouldn't give me his real name.  I don't even know how he got in the building.  His name is...  His name is Mr...  Mr. E.  Mr. E.  Mr. E.  See, it's Mr. E. 
[03:41:00]  There's his card.  He gave me his card.  Oh, really?  Could you pop up a picture of the fucking...  Of Demolition?  Because I remember Demolition...  And that guy doesn't look like a Demolition guy.  That guy looks like the guy that sells you insurance.  Right.  He also...  He does not look like...  No.  ...the Demolition, I remember.  He also played the Rebo man.  That's Crush.  That's not...  That's Crush.  You know, Danny...  I didn't...  How am I supposed to recognize the guy 25 years later?  Okay.  I didn't recognize him at all. 
[03:41:30]  Let's, uh...  Let's watch a Saw 6 commercial.  Oh, great.  Fucking Saw.  Enough with the Saw movies.  All right.  Which one is he?  No, those are the Road Warriors.  Yeah.  Those are the...  There's Demolition.  There it is.  He's the one with the white, red, and black, not the silver.  What are you talking about?  The one on the right or the left, say?  Which one?  My right or your right?  It's the same for you, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're all looking at the same picture, dumbass.  Is it on the right or the left?  Do what?  This one.  With the wrong hair.  On the right?  Yeah.  On the right side.  The right?  That's the guy that was just in? 
[03:42:00]  That's the guy that was in here?  No, I think it's the other guy.  No, that's Smash.  So how am I supposed to know that?  Nah, it looks like the other guy.  It's not the other guy.  He doesn't have any makeup on, and it's 20 years later.  That's who it is.  He does...  When he does his appearances, though, they put the makeup on, but he's bald.  Right.  Yeah, I noticed that.  So he's still, uh...  Well, you should put, like, a little hair thing on.  A little wig?  Yeah, why not?  He also played the Repo Man.  He looks like old Bill Deal down in the front of the room.  That's who he looks like!  He did look like him a little bit like fucking Wade. 
[03:42:30]  Good old Wade.  We're not a bank, Jerry.  That's who he looked like.  He was driving me nuts.  Like Wade.  Like a slightly younger version of Wade.  Younger version of Wade.  All right, now we got it.  And that was Luke.  That was Luke of the Bushwikers.  I think Butch is in New Zealand.  Ah.  Do they still get together?  Well, Luke's the fun one anyway.  Yeah, Butch doesn't...  No, Butch doesn't do anything anymore.  Are you going to have an exclusive interview with Virgil?  Virgil, I'm hearing that this is the time.  Virgil?  This time you're finally going to get that interview.  Hanging out at the table all alone? 
[03:43:00]  Well, the problem is Virgil charges for everything at these conventions.  Even for an interview?  I'm sure that he would charge me if I asked to do an interview with him.  Jesus.  It's Mike time, you fuck.  That's why he doesn't...  Well, look at his table.  There's nobody there.  There's a picture that Danny pops up all the time.  I love that one.  It's Virgil just sitting at a table by himself, waiting for someone to come up and ask for an autograph.  And no one is because he charges.  It's the best photo, I think, ever.  It's such a sad photo.  If you just go to Google Images and put in Virgil signing.  And it says wrestling superstar.  You can't put WWE, WWF, nothing. 
[03:43:30]  It's just...  Virgil.  Yeah.  And he's completely alone.  Oh, God.  Vince, give these guys some money.  They made you a billionaire.  I did enough for them.  They could kiss my ass.  All right, we're babbling now.  Yeah, let's get the fuck out.  And have a good weekend.  I'll see you on Monday.  Absolutely.  Thank you, everybody else.  Have a good weekend.  And thanks for the support.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  I want to say hello to all my intelligent radio station fans up here in Anthony. 
[03:44:00]  And I want to say thanks to the Jesus or Muhammad or Allah to have come to the most famous city in the world.  Like Fred Sinatra said, the city never sleeps.  The city is up all the time, Manhattan, Madison, New York, and especially Opie and Anthony, Radio Station.  I love all my wrestling fans, and I love all radio station people wrestling, Anthony and Opie, Opie in show. 
[03:44:30]  Number one in the world, from A to the C.  If you cannot make it New York, you don't make it nowhere.  Like Fred Sinatra said, the city never sleeps.  You cannot make it New York, you don't make it nowhere.  God bless Fred Sinatra, my Italian fason.  He used to come watch my match in the garden, and he was the rare, rare singer and hot class and part mafia. 
[03:45:00]  God bless. </pre>
