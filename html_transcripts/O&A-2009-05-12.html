<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious rant about an unfair promotional campaign by XM Satellite Radio.  Opie and Anthony felt unfairly slighted by a week-long free promotion for Howard Stern's channel, without a reciprocal offer on Stern's channel for their show.  They vehemently protested this perceived double standard, using copious amounts of profane language to express their anger and frustration.  Caller Bill corroborated their claims, stating he hadn't seen any O&A promotions on XM despite being a frequent listener. Another caller, "Psycho Bob" (a self-proclaimed anesthesiologist, though the hosts offered alternative, joking nicknames), called in to express support.  The hosts also lamented their previous, poorly chosen channel name, "The Virus," and Anthony shared a humorous anecdote about a gun casing striking Keith in the forehead during target practice.  Anthony's anger escalated, fueled by the news that his personal, unpaid web show filmed in his basement was being shut down by the company, despite not violating his contract. This was framed as an attack on his freedom of speech.  The hosts contemplated retaliatory actions, including Anthony potentially establishing a porn studio in his basement.  Jimmy was present in the studio throughout this segment.

The next segment focused on the company's restrictive policies regarding their online presence in 2009. Opie detailed being told that their use of Twitter, Facebook, and online videos violated their contract.  The conversation was peppered with emphatic repetitions of the word "Face," alongside humorous commentary on a still image of Anthony displaying a seemingly psychopathic expression after firing a .45 caliber handgun in a home video. The hosts speculated on the reasons behind these restrictions, questioning if it was due to perceived threats or a misunderstanding of their organic online growth. Several listener calls offered support, and the hosts referenced former colleagues Eric Logan and Elo (remarking on Elo’s impressive weight loss since leaving satellite radio). They strongly defended their online content, including Anthony's "Live at the Compound" videos, arguing it positively impacted their radio show's listenership and value to XM.  The discussion veered into humorous tangents, including speculation about a possible "rat" within their workplace, showcased photos from the show’s past, Eddie Money’s recent studio visit, the NBA Playoffs, Cat Stevens/Youssef Islam's music, and a rumored Playboy photoshoot featuring Shirley Jones. The segment concluded with anecdotes about an elderly stripper who appeared on the show and past, sexually explicit antics on the road, including incidents involving their genitals and women.

The show then shifted to a bizarre contest to find the oldest naked woman willing to appear, offering a $1000 reward for someone older than their current record of 72. This segment involved graphic descriptions of elderly pornography and a listener’s angry reaction after discovering his mother was only 69.  They played a caller's awkward singing along with Eddie Money (a guest on the previous day’s show), criticized a backstage interview with Eddie Money conducted by Sam Roberts, and engaged in extended discussion and playing of various songs, including an attempt to identify a Bob Seger song with a caller.  The segment also involved discussion of a video of a woman in a revealing bathing suit, with speculation about her identity. Eddie Money was mentioned as a guest from the previous day, along with Roland (a booker who had previously rejected Eddie Money twice), Sam Roberts, Danny, and Derek (an Eddie Money superfan who was previously embarrassed on air).  The hosts also discussed the perceived feud with Howard Stern’s show, specifically referencing an insulting joke by Fat Boy Hardy about their listenership.

The following segment primarily focused on the reactions to Wanda Sykes' joke about Rush Limbaugh at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.  Opie and Anthony, along with an unnamed White House correspondent, discussed the White House's response, deemed disingenuous, speculating on Obama's true feelings toward Limbaugh.  They compared the criticism faced by Sykes and David Feherty (for a joke about Nancy Pelosi), attributing the difference to Sykes' race and the target of her humor.  The conversation then drifted to a Family Guy episode mirroring an O&A bit, leading to speculation about a possible fan among its writers. The discussion touched upon Jimmy's improving reading skills, their upcoming Los Angeles trip, Saudi Arabia's treatment of women (including a judge condoning spousal abuse), technical difficulties, and inside jokes.  Studio guest DJ Who Kid (from Eminem's Shade 45) joined, discussing his work with Eminem, a bizarre encounter with Michael Jackson in Bahrain, and various other celebrities and rappers.  Who Kid also showcased his gun-handling skills in a pre-recorded video. The segment concluded with discussions about a previous bit featuring Tony Danza and further comedic interactions.

The final segment continued the conversation with Who Kid, focusing on celebrity gossip.  He recounted a bizarre encounter with Michael Jackson, emphasizing the absence of molestation despite suggestive photos and videos.  The conversation then explored rumors about Tupac's survival, Puff Daddy's business acumen and sexuality, and various other celebrities (Eminem, 50 Cent, Rihanna, Jessica Simpson, Nick Lachey, Sean William Scott, and Kelly Clarkson), often involving sexually suggestive comments and rumors. Who Kid described his own show, characterized by aggressive interviewing and insults.  They also discussed a viral video of a woman cooking fried chicken, deemed racially charged due to a lack of diversity among the children present.  The segment concluded with a discussion of their various radio shows and future plans.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Yeah!  Good morning, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi!  I'm having a few issues with my personal computer.  Really?  Yeah.  Kind of blew up on me.  Oh well.  The little one?  Yeah, the little one.  What happened to it?  I don't know, I had a little problem.  That's all it needs. 
[00:00:30]  It's a little problem and you can't use it anymore.  Poor little fella.  Poor little fella, I put him in a shoebox and buried him out back.  Yes.  We knew that things were going too well.  Yeah, we just knew that it was just a matter of time something would be shoved our way.  I just, um, I don't know. 
[00:01:00]  I'm beside myself, as they say, when you get annoyed at something.  Well, two issues came up yesterday.  I'm sure we're allowed to discuss this in a professional manner, aren't we?  Should be able to.  Should be able to.  No one told us not to.  The other guy is allowed to, so why not us?  No one told us not to.  And, um, as long as there's no disparagement of any person, uh, then, you know, I don't see why we can't discuss anything. 
[00:01:30]  Well, there's a huge confusion going on in the O&A camp.  Yeah.  I guess there's going to be a promotion, uh, in the very near future where they're going to, um, offer, um, Howard Stern for free to all XM listeners for like a week or so.  For a week.  So that way, um.  Give it a taste, you know, which actually, which actually is a very good idea.  Of course it is.  It's a very good idea.  Yep.  Uh, and we don't have a problem with that.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:02:00]  And, uh, I guess every channel on XM is running promos saying just that.  Yeah.  So if you have XM, but you don't have that extra package that gives you, uh, Howard's show, um, then you'll hear Howard for free for a week and then go, oh, maybe this is, you know, what I want to do.  So let me, uh, fess up and get the serious package along with my XM package.  Now, the vice versa angle would be.  The vice versa. 
[00:02:30]  Would be the.  Well, well, before you get to that, uh, but our channel is the only channel not running the promos.  Right.  Uh, for, not, not because we, we demanded that they're not run, by the way.  No.  Uh, so they came to us yesterday and, uh, they're basically telling us that these promos are going to start running on your channel.  Uh-huh.  And this is where the confusion comes in because, uh, this hurts our livelihood. 
[00:03:00]  We want to be company guys and all that, but this hurts our livelihood and I'll tell you why.  So our listeners are going to be turned on to Howard for a week if you choose to do that.  Uh-huh.  And then it's just natural that some of those people, a small percentage, by the way, and I'm not saying because I'm not going after Howard or anything.  It's just, it's just how this type of thing works.  Yeah.  A small percentage after the free trial will pick up the best of serious package and start listening to Howard regularly. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Hurting, hurting us, the Opie and Anthony show.  So, you know, siphoning off some of our listeners and giving it over to Howard.  Howard, um, and then you look down the line and people can then go, oh, look at that, Howard's numbers went up.  Uh-huh.  And then they go, uh, you know, hey, what happened to O&A?  Look, uh, the listenership went down.  Right.  Not, you know, even considering the fact that having a one-sided, a one-sided promotional deal like that, uh, is not quid pro quo, as they say. 
[00:04:00]  If you were doing it, uh, at the same time where now on Stern's show, they were taking out ads saying that our program will be available to the Sirius platform for free for a week.  Uh-huh.  Then no problems at all because you're going to trade over listenership.  There's going to be some defection from either show if they like the show they're listening to for free.  And, uh, they'll get the platform. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  They'll get the other, uh, platform, uh, fess up some money.  Company makes some bucks.  Uh, each of the shows get a little bit of a newer audience.  And everyone's happy, aren't they?  Yeah, but that's not happening.  No.  And we're trying to understand how this possibly makes sense.  Yeah.  How does it make sense?  And we even said to Blatter, we're like, well, all right, then you guys go to Howard and tell them that, you know, this company's finally going to be advertising the Opie and Anthony show on his channels. 
[00:05:00]  Because as far as picking up best of XM packages, that is the epicenter to get that done.  Exactly.  That is the place to get that done.  When you think about marketing, you think about, all right, where do we go to get the best value for our dollar?  But for some reason, well, I know the reason because, you know, we have a history and all that, which by the way, I have no problem sitting down and seeing what, what the, the, the real problem is and seeing if we could hash something out. 
[00:05:30]  At this point, yeah.  I have no effing problem doing that.  It's, it's, it's years, years and years ago.  Right.  I mean, come on already.  But it's, there's a couple of things going on.  One, I think they're too scared to even talk to Howard about that.  So we have to sit here and, and, and just, you know, and, and take more bullshit.  That doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense.  It is siphoning off our audience without any return for us, without anything. 
[00:06:00]  And, and how about this?  Not even, not even, hey, put, put our, uh, have us for free, offered for free.  That's the first step.  How about just having us offered for free on the Sirius platform for a week?  Yeah, because if you need, if you want to, like, generate more revenue for this company.  Would you do that?  We certainly would bring in a little more money for you.  So how about you start that?  We would bring in more money than just about any other XM channel if you offered it for free on the Sirius platform.  How about you just start there, then let me go crazy here and suggest that every channel except Howard's has ads saying that we'll be there on Sirius platform for a week, free. 
[00:06:30]  How about that?  Nope.  And then the crazy idea is that, plus, have it run on Howard's show, which you, you will never hear that happen, by the way.  Uh, so, for us, giving our listeners, um, uh, uh, uh, you know, giving our listeners away, leaving them there available for siphoning off, um, we, in return, will get what happened to Anthony, uh, Opie and Anthony's numbers. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, I don't really, um, I understand how it helps the company.  We're all about, you know, trying to help the company, sure.  But you can't do this double standard one-way bullshit anymore.  That makes us look bad, first of all, um, if, if our, our numbers took a dip, we, we'd look bad, regardless of the situation. 
[00:07:30]  We would just look bad.  It makes, it, it, what happens is financially, people are gonna, they're still gonna listen to this show, because you can listen in the morning to one, listen in the afternoon to the other.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, but you, you, yeah.  But you have to pay for a package.  Right.  And when you pay for that package, and this package doesn't get bought, contractually, all of a sudden, there's a, it's like forcing Z100 to allow 92.3 to advertise on it.  Yeah.  And not allowing the reverse.  Yeah.  And then, contractually, uh, you hold them both to the same rating standards.  Right.  And say, okay, well, now your money is not gonna go up because you didn't get the ratings, and you'll say, but you forced our competitor to advertise on it. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, they advertised on our, and we sent our listeners over there, and, no, we'll see, what, what, who, what, that's what we would get.  It's just, it's just amazing, it's just amazing to us, I mean, to come to us and say, hey, you don't really, you don't have a, they make believe we have some kind of weird choice in this, and, and our, and our choice has always been, just keep it fair.  Just keep it fair.  Yeah, we, we believe in our abilities and our show, that if we, we were offered for free for a week, and, and Howard's show was offered, uh, free for a week, we would do just fine competing with him in that way. 
[00:08:30]  And guess what, the company in the end wins, because you're, you're selling, uh, best of packages, uh, best of XM packages, and best of series packages.  Yeah, and if it's all about, uh, the revenue.  And, and, you know what, later when he talks to us, because I guess we have to talk now, you know, he's gonna go, well, that, you know, tough shit.  It's not fair, but this is how it's gonna be.  That's, uh.  Which doesn't make sense.  Why, why can't they, why can't they talk to that guy? 
[00:09:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  They pay him enough, why can't you talk to that guy and go, look, we're the good of the company, we need to do some stuff.  Anyone I've ever talked to about approaching, um, him to, to speak to him about something, never says they talk to him.  Um, it's some weird power wall that is up, that they're like, well, no, I, I, that's not, I don't, to make those, uh, decisions.  I don't do that.  I don't do this.  And then you go, oh, really? 
[00:09:30]  All right.  Well, who does?  Well, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So, uh, yeah, that won't get resolved, I know it, we'll, we'll get in a meeting today, um, and we will be told that the ads will be running, um, that you will be able to get, uh, Howard, uh, on XM for free for a week.  And, um, yeah, good luck to us.  Hopefully, hopefully we hold on to, um, our listeners.  Well, you know, you know, when they offered us as best of XM, you know, they're running promos on a lot of channels that you can get the best of XM featuring Opie and Anthony, whatever. 
[00:10:00]  But the one place to get the, the most best of XM packages, for some reason, they're, they will not put a promo on, on his channels.  It, it, it just amazes me.  And just because we're speaking logically, now we're going to get yelled at.  Oh, believe me, this will come up.  We're, we're, I mean, we, we make, make believe, we have fun with our ages on the, on the air and stuff, but we're, we're, we're, we're middle-aged men and we will be red-faced yelled at today for just bringing this up on the show. 
[00:10:30]  Like sitting in a principal's office and being yelled at with, with veins popping out of people's heads.  Um, and we'll be called insane and this and that, but when we're just, when we're just, when we're just using, you know, complete logic.  And then the other thing will be, well, you know, instead of going on the air and saying this, you should have come and waited and talked to us first.  Um, we know, we know how that plays out.  We've done it enough times.  That's why we bring it up on the air because it plays out in an office where we are told what we are supposed to do. 
[00:11:00]  And that's what we do.  I thought we were one big happy family now.  So, all right, we're, we'll, whatever.  Or you want to advertise Howard on, on 202 on XM or, or, uh, Sirius 197 fine.  All we ask is we get the same thing in return.  That's all we've ever asked for is fairness.  And since we are all one company, where's the problem?  And people think, where is the problem?  And people think we're insane.  This is the same argument we've been having for almost 10 years.  All we want is fairness. 
[00:11:30]  That's all we ever wanted.  Equal, equal footing.  That's all.  Because we have never been scared about competing with a radio show.  Because I guess that's what it's about in the end.  Is it?  Or is, or is there still bad blood?  And if there is, fine.  They're listening right now.  I'll sit down.  I'll sit down right now.  I'll sit down right at 11.  I'll sit down somewhere else in the city and, and, and, and see what the, what the real issue is.  Hash it out and see what the big problem is. 
[00:12:00]  Why can't we be on equal footing as far as promotion goes when it's the same company?  We're not competing anymore.  I could understand years ago.  We were competing.  That's, that was the answer to the whole thing.  We were competing.  And they, you know, you wouldn't want to take care of the competition.  Even though that technically it was still the same company.  But, you know, morning shows, morning radio, whatever.  This is one company.  This is one company. 
[00:12:30]  We're all in the same building.  And if it's all about revenue and helping the company, you would think they would want to do the exact same thing with this show and try to get some listeners from the serious side over to us.  Honestly, not, you know, I don't want to confuse everybody because, I mean, what, what to have the exact same promotion that Howard's getting?  What are you, crazy?  All we're asking is that.  No.  You tell people on his channels that we're now here and you could get us part of Best of XM. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Because when, when we first came over here and became one happy company, I'm like, okay, finally, you know, the company will do right.  You know, they're trying to sell these Best of XM packages.  The number one place to go would be his channels.  But he obviously will not allow that, but, but the company will allow, will allow his promotion to be on our channel.  All jocks are given this to read.  Don't mention of ONA. 
[00:13:30]  Hmm?  What is this?  I guess this is, I guess this is liners that all the jocks are given to read about, um, this goes, this is already released.  It goes out on the air.  People have been reading this already on, on both platforms or whatever, or.  I guess Sirius.  Sirius?  It's a, it's called.  It says the Best of Sirius and XM packages are available.  Mm-hmm.  XM listeners get both of Howard Stern's channels, Martha Stewart, Living, uh, Sirius NASCAR Radio, Sirius NFL Radio, and Playboy Radio. 
[00:14:00]  Sirius listeners get Oprah Radio, XM Public Radio featuring Bob Edwards, MLB Home Plate, NBA Games, NHL Home Ice, the PGA Tour Network, and college sports.  What is your obsession with Bob Edwards?  Ugh.  He's a niche fucking show.  One call now and you can get the best of Sirius.  I understand some people like that NPR stuff.  But Bob Edwards isn't going to get the job done for you as far as selling packages. 
[00:14:30]  So this is the, this is being read by pretty much all the channels with not a mention of the Opie and Anthony show being available for the best of the package.  Hey, look how great it is.  Sirius listeners get Oprah, XM Public Radio featuring Bob Edwards, Home Plate, NBA Games, NHL Home Ice, the PGA Tour Network, and college sports.  None of that, by the way, addresses like male comedy, like, uh, the male demo comedy.  None of that addresses that.  It didn't.  Yeah.  No. 
[00:15:00]  No.  One call now, you get the best of Sirius or the best of XM.  Mother.  It's that easy.  God.  Holy fucking mother of Jesus Christ nailed on a cross.  So, that's what we're dealing with today.  And we'll get in trouble for just bringing it up.  Yeah.  That's just exhibit A, too.  Well.  Yesterday was just a fun-filled day of, of informative hijinks going on here.  Hold on.  I want to get, um, and don't worry. 
[00:15:30]  Keeping it, uh, keeping it, uh, above table today.  Dolan in Arizona.  Dolan.  Ha.  It's actually Bill.  Oh, wonderful.  Jesus.  Hello, Bill.  Yeah.  Uh, anyway, uh, I've been listening to Squiz off and on for, like, the last two, three weeks.  And every time I hear that, uh, promo, never once a mention of Opie and Anthony on any of  the other channels.  My wife listens, too.  She hasn't heard it.  None of my friends.  Nothing.  I gotta tell you, Bladder told me yesterday, he goes, no, you, your names are, uh, you know, 
[00:16:00]  all over the talk, uh, platform besides Howard Stern.  And I said, I, I actually, uh, you know, to keep it fair, I didn't, I, I didn't say this  back to him, but I was thinking to myself, no, we're not.  I've been doing a lot of driving lately.  And my latest thing is to scan through all the talk shows that that's what I've been doing  lately.  Taking a break from music in general.  I got the best of, um, uh, actually I, I got a serious unit in my car cause of the  car I bought.  So I got the best of XM.  Um, so I'm just going from talk show to talk show, to talk show, discovering some kind 
[00:16:30]  of, you know, pretty cool stuff that I don't feel like, uh, talking about, by the way.  Yeah.  I'll keep that to myself.  Cause it's smart to keep things to yourself.  Trust me.  And I, I have probably put in, wow, man, 20 to 30 hours in the last few weeks.  Cause I've been driving back and forth to Philly out to Long Island.  And I swear to you, Steve, and I should have told you this yesterday.  And I'll tell you after the show today, I did not hear our names once.  So if there is some kind of promo that's running, I guess, I guess I'm just missing 
[00:17:00]  it.  I guess that I, I guess my luck has just been bad as far as that goes.  Yeah.  That must be it.  They're doing what they're doing to promote first quarter earnings.  Well, no, we understand why the company is doing this Howard promotion.  We totally get it from a company standpoint.  You offer a show for free, give people a taste.  It's like being a drug dealer.  You give people a taste and you hope they come back for more.  Right.  After you give them the freebie.  We understand that.  But if the people, if the, if the druggies come back for more, it's going to hurt our 
[00:17:30]  drug business.  And if it's right.  And all we ask is, you know, cause that sounds kind of selfish.  Let us sell our drugs.  Let us sell our drugs is all we're saying properly.  And whoever wrote this promotion, I don't know who you are or what the motive is, but I  will say that anybody that thinks, and I'm not saying that this show is the biggest  show in the history of fucking radio, but anyone that it is, Jimmy, well, it's satellite  radio.  I mean, it all is radio, right?  Oh, right.  It stays right.  But if anyone thinks that, uh, XM public radio featuring, and this is no disrespect to 
[00:18:00]  Bob Edwards, but if you think that that show is going to generate more listeners who are  going to pay for a package in the Opian Anthony show, you're a dummy, right?  You're a dummy.  Exactly.  And you're not doing your job properly.  It's, um, it's, it's beyond me.  And of course they want to promote, you know, to get every, every company wants to do something  to bring up every quarter.  Right.  Uh, uh, you know, they don't want to lose money, but the fact is, why wouldn't you want  more money by doing the same for us? 
[00:18:30]  It's not for us.  It's for the company.  You would be getting more subscribers, subscribers, paying the extra money to hear the Opian Anthony  show, unless of course, and I'm going out on a crazy limb here, you don't believe that  this show would generate any, uh, extra subscriptions if, uh, given for free for a week, uh, over  at the serious platform.  Um, which I, I absolutely believe that's what a lot of these people think.  Cause I, I don't believe I don't have this, I don't have this feeling, this belief that 
[00:19:00]  there is a passionate belief in this program with some people, uh, that are in charge here.  That's all I'll, that's all I'll say.  That's as far as I'll go with that.  But I really don't think there, and again, I'm not talking about the Howard belief.  I'm not talking about that.  This, this whole, this whole company is rotating around the sun.  That is Howard Stern.  Believe me, I, I've seen it.  I know, uh, that isn't an, even an issue, but you know, to just, I'm not even, I don't 
[00:19:30]  feel that people really believe in the potential and the, uh, what we've done here, uh, with  this, with the Opian Anthony show.  So we are kind of, um, shit on.  And once again, I'll say that, you know, offering us for free, that's, you're just crazy.  I'm just saying, just have our names mentioned on that channel, knowing that people go,  oh, wow, okay, I used to, there are people that still don't know that we're back on radio.  No, no, people go, where are, where'd you go?  You know.  I used to listen on this, this, this, yeah, you know, really? 
[00:20:00]  All I ask, all I ask is if, if Howard's going to be promoted on this channel, all right,  let us promote on his channel.  That's a great place to be.  That's it.  We would be crazy to say that's not a great place to be, to, uh, to be promoted.  We're not talking live reads.  We're just talking stuff that pops on during a commercial break.  But it sounds like we're not even, we're barely promoted in general when they're talking  about the best of XM package.  Yeah.  Well, we got a shareholder on the line, Anthony.  Do we?  Uh, yeah, his name's, for real, but, uh, Psycho Bob. 
[00:20:30]  Come on, boys.  I mean.  Credibility when he stands up to address the.  Psycho Bob would like to address the, uh.  Yes, the, uh.  Chairman.  The board.  Psycho Bob would like to address the bigwigs.  I mean.  Yes.  First of all, gentlemen, gentlemen, Frunkus.  Gentlemen.  Don't you understand, like, you gotta go watch Fight Club, Psycho Bob.  When, when we're discussing stuff like this, you're just Bob and you wear a tie.  Don't you understand Fight Club shit?  Yes.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Yes, Psycho Bob. 
[00:21:00]  What would you like to say to the shareholders of this multi-billion dollar company?  Who would you like to?  Why couldn't it be Harvard Bob?  Yeah.  Princeton Bob.  Psycho Bob.  Yeah.  You gotta change your name.  Maybe he's a psychiatrist.  Ah.  Are you a psychiatrist?  No.  No, I'm an anesthesiologist, actually.  Oh.  All right.  Well, okay.  How about Rapist Bob?  Wait.  You're an anesthesiologist and your nickname is Psycho Bob.  Great.  That's even worse.  Who's on anesthesia today?  Psycho Bob.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  No problem.  I don't know who you complain to because, you know, when we go down that road, it just 
[00:21:30]  gets ugly.  Yeah.  I'm not.  It's not even one of these call to arms things.  It's just me and Opie and Jimmy if he wants to can just go in there and has to, you know,  have to duke it out ourselves with these people.  Have to just sit there and take it.  Sit there and, yeah, well, that's pretty much where it ends.  I really have to just take some breaths in that office because I swear I go animalistic. 
[00:22:00]  I'm like the one that's usually very calm.  I try to be logical, but then when I lose my mind, you've heard it on the air.  Then I do it.  And it doesn't matter who I'm in front of either.  I do the same thing to people we meet with and that I do with crazy listeners.  So it kind of gets ugly sometimes.  People are asking if we should be emailing cockpictures to Elo because of this problem. 
[00:22:30]  Feel free.  Technically, you probably should.  If you can find Elo.  Because that motherfucker, like, ran away from us.  The smartest man in broadcasting was Eric Logan.  He saw the fucking, he read the tea leaves and fucking bolted.  He packed his bags like a cartoon character.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  He left a fucking hole of his body shape in a suitcase in one of the walls. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, don't send him cockpictures.  Why reward him for leaving?  You actually heard that ricochet and saw that smoke, the swirling smoke when he left.  He was gone.  Fucking guy left like a cartoon.  Suitcase.  Yes.  And I got good news.  We got Mike in Georgia.  Listen to this.  Mike?  Mikey.  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Oh, he's gone.  Oh, you left.  What did Mike want to say?  He says, you're out.  He actually heard our names on the emergency channel.  Oh, really?  That's good. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, by the way, I did hear us mention on traffic and weather for the New York area.  Oh, wow.  For real?  No.  Of course not.  I was getting excited.  I'm like, wow, awesome.  Yes.  It's a start, at least.  So that was the first problem.  And I knew, like, Friday, Friday, this individual starts me in the lobby to say how great we're  doing lately, and I was very suspicious.  I was like, wow, is he actually giving a compliment without trying to get something from us?  Because usually we don't get compliments from that person. 
[00:24:00]  Everything with this company is a leveraging thing.  Everything is, I will do this for you, now you do this for me.  And I swear to you, like, this is the first time in our 14 years together, 15 years together,  that we've had to deal with that.  Sometimes companies just allow you to do things just to keep you happy, knowing that it's  helping the product.  It's not about, wait, how do we know this is helping us right now? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  When it's this just very weird gray area thing, like, you keep the boys happy, they do a better  show for you, which leads to, you know, a place where you need the show to be.  Right.  But this company, man, it's like, well, if we do this for you, then you've got to do this.  It's just, it's a nightmare.  It's constantly negotiating.  I've never, I've never worked in an environment like this.  It's like a marketplace in Bali.  So when, when.  It's got a barter for a chicken.  So when I was being told how, how the listenership is way up, online listening, especially, I 
[00:25:00]  guess, because, because they really can keep track of that.  I, I, I walked out of the building happy, but within a block, I'm like, all right, my,  my, my suspicions, you know, were raised.  I'm like, what, what is it, what is this going to mean in the end?  Something's up.  Yeah.  And sure enough, we found out yesterday with the Howard promo on our channel.  And then, and then the other problem, which, which is more Anthony's problem than mine.  This is, wait till you hear this one. 
[00:25:30]  This is just bizarre.  I really, and I almost expected it.  I almost expected it.  But I was like, eh, nah.  But the, the, the dummy in me thought I could just do this.  Um, I've been running a little web show from my basement.  Much like the great Rupert Pupkin. 
[00:26:00]  Uh, well, that all the polish of his show.  Yes.  Without the polish.  Well, he's crazier than you because he was doing that for nobody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You at least get, uh, people to hear what you're doing.  I get, I get some people up there.  Sure.  Sure.  Um, yeah.  I, uh, decided I would do this.  Um, I was informed by our super agent, Bob Eatman yesterday on a phone call.  He called me and I thought, Bob had to work yesterday. 
[00:26:30]  It was really weird.  I called him.  Bob was like, oh my God.  He said he'd get back to me.  Uh, he did get back to me and I thought it was about this, um, unequality as far as the  cross promoting goes that we were talking about yesterday.  Much to my chagrin, I was then informed that I am not allowed to do a video show from my 
[00:27:00]  own basement in my house off hours for free.  Uh, I was, I swear to you, I took a second and went like, wait, what?  And he said, yeah, the, the, uh, uh, I was called and told that, um, there, the, everyone  knows that you're doing this, the board, um, uh, the, the higher ups, everybody knows. 
[00:27:30]  And, uh, you're, you're, you're not supposed to be doing any other show.  You're exclusive to them.  I go, yeah, I'm exclusive to them.  Um, you will not get the Opie and Anthony show.  Um, as, as it is on serious, uh, in my basement, you get Anthony, uh, uh, me drinking with my  good friend, Daniel, uh, taking calls in an open public forum and discussing anything that 
[00:28:00]  might come up.  That, to me, is called the first amendment.  That is my constitutional right, which cannot be overwritten by any contract.  You can't write a contract that gives up someone's right as an American.  And that, to me, is what's happening here.  I'm not charging money.  I'm not taking, uh, any money away from the company doing this. 
[00:28:30]  I'm not giving the product that I am, uh, uh, contractually obligated to give this company  to other people.  Well, this is my house.  I set up a webcam in my house and I'm being told I can't do this.  If I want to set up a webcam by my pool and which I, I planned on doing and have, you know,  when, uh, girls are over, a little bikini show, shit like that.  Um, I can't do that. 
[00:29:00]  I can't discuss things, uh, can I blog?  Can I go on a service like PalTalk when I'm home and for a whole night just sit there and  maybe discuss issues with various other people that are on there?  Or is that, or I'm not allowed to use the internet, uh, for free and go to various sites  and, and discuss things, uh, as an American, uh, uh, and not be infringed upon for my, uh,  first amendment, which is the freedom of speech.  I can talk to people over, uh, uh, the internet. 
[00:29:30]  I think my mistake was, and I honestly think this, if I just had a webcam on a laptop and  just went to a site like, uh, PalTalk or something, no one would have said a word.  I made the mistake of making it look too good.  I got microphones because I wanted it to sound good.  So I got nice microphones and they must've saw those and went, ah, they're better than  our shit equipment and, uh, uh, they got a problem now. 
[00:30:00]  Now there's a fucking problem with me from my house off hours.  Is there one person around here that gets what we do?  That fucking understands.  That gets that we've always been extremely interactive with the audience and in the end  it just adds to the product.  We're giving the free, we're giving free stuff to the audience that doesn't infringe.  Does one person around here understand that Anthony's talking to a few hundred people at  any given time?  Yep.  And that is, and they're all subscribers by the way. 
[00:30:30]  They're all fucking subscribers.  You go to, you go to the site I broadcast on, you go to a site that anyone else has that  doesn't have a radio show and, uh, there's nine people in the room.  Do they understand that it brings material to this show?  Do they understand that we had plans to do, like, you know, bring some of that audio that  Ant's doing in his basement over to here?  Yeah.  Do they understand the overall picture?  That I plug the, uh, uh, radio show, this radio show to people that are watching me in 
[00:31:00]  my basement in my own fucking house for free?  It's cost me money.  This project is a hobby for me.  It's a hobby.  I'm not trying to step on your fucking toes by broadcasting on the internet from my basement.  To a few hundred people at any given moment.  Relax a little bit.  Okay?  And the reality is it would probably grow to a point where it's a few thousand.  A few thousand people that already subscribe to satellite radio.  Exactly. 
[00:31:30]  You know what?  I just bought a fucking CB radio too.  Motherfucker.  You know something?  You wouldn't be able to key down on a CB channel.  God damn it.  And, and talk to people.  I was bringing back diamond dust and everything.  This is.  My CB name.  Oh.  But I was 12.  Bizarre to me.  When Bob told me this.  When Bob told me this, I couldn't believe that they are trying to make me stop, uh, going  on the internet from my basement.  When I, it's not like I'm calling in going, um, yeah, uh, hi. 
[00:32:00]  Uh, yeah, I'm not going to make it into work today.  Yeah, I feel sick.  Yeah, it's, um, it's about 5.30 in the morning.  I'm just telling you, I'm not going to make it in.  And then it's six o'clock.  I'm online going, hey, it's the Anthony show.  Hi.  I, I fully expect it because, uh, we've been sitting on this news for almost a day  because we, you know, found out after the show.  That's usually when all the shit happens, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, and then we have to just bite our, literally bite our lips off. 
[00:32:30]  Until they bleed.  Yeah.  Uh, I fully expected you weren't going to be here today.  I'd start the show with Jimmy, and then I'd get phone calls that Anthony has bunkered down.  I have bunkered down and doing his show.  He has fired up his webcam, his green screen.  He's eating out Rihanna's ass.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Eating out Rihanna's ass.  See, we don't do that here.  By the way, my, my shitty headphones, I, I can't even hear.  Hello?  Am I still on the air for real? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, you are.  Did they just go out?  Yeah, they just went out.  Hit the, um, was it the cord?  I got some in my basement that are brand fucking new, and they work like a charm.  Unfortunately, I'll never use them.  I need it.  There, see, there's me licking Rihanna's ass.  Every time I move the headphone cord, I go, I can't hear myself, Mara, so we gotta change  out this, uh.  That's gonna hurt the company, isn't it?  I know, but they're looking at one of their big stars doing that.  Yuck!  Exactly! 
[00:33:30]  Exactly!  And they're saying, you know, that doesn't look good.  But it's the Opie and Anthony show, it's not fucking Bob Edwards licking her ass.  That is true.  That fits me to a T.  That is true.  But I think that, it's the visual of that, that I think the board looked at and said,  you know, we pay this guy a lot of money, and he's licking a screen with a teenager's  ass on it.  What do we do about this?  Yeah, but, you know what?  Everything is going well.  Really well. 
[00:34:00]  Yep.  Really well.  Better than they thought we were gonna do, by the way.  And let's be honest, though, I think their expectations were very, very low for us.  Very low, because they always are, because we fucking are just pieces of shit.  So, what I don't understand is, everything is going so well, so why don't you just keep  everything where it is?  Why would you wanna, you know, bring this-  Justification of jobs, Opie.  Why would you bring this up?  Because you know it's just gonna irritate the shit out of us.  It's gonna irritate the shit out of you.  Now we got a problem with management again. 
[00:34:30]  There's people I don't even wanna look at, and that'll last for at least a month now.  At least.  I know.  And everything was going well.  So, why can't you just let everything just continue how it is?  It was obviously working.  Anthony coming in here with the stories from Live at the Compound, and his weekends, and  we're gonna bring it to the next level, and give the people, you know, some of the audio  from his basement, so they don't feel like they're missing anything.  But why?  Why?  Why?  Every time things are going well, that this shit has to happen. 
[00:35:00]  Why?  Are there people down the hall that are just scared of success or something?  Why?  Because now we're in a bad mood.  You're in a bad mood.  Why do we have to be fucked with?  Everyone's irritated.  Why couldn't you just keep it how it was?  It was obviously working.  All this interacting we're doing with the listeners is working.  You just told me Friday that everything is great.  The listeners...  So if everything's great, leave everything alone.  The listeners of other shows do not get the access to our lives that they do from this 
[00:35:30]  show.  Show me one other fucking popular radio show that gives the listeners this personal, like,  access, extra time, our own time for free.  For fucking free.  Just to get to know us better.  Get to see another side of us.  It helps the fucking satellite show.  It helps what we're doing right here.  Because it's not the same dumb motherfuckers just coming in and punching a time clock and 
[00:36:00]  then fucking leaving.  We give the listeners more.  We give them shit after the show.  We're constantly trying to figure out, using new technology, how to keep in touch with the  listeners and give them something a little extra than other shows give them.  And my contribution was going down into my fucking basement in front of a camera and  just letting them share a little of what goes on at my house after I get off of work. 
[00:36:30]  And you're fucking telling me, and not dime one, I probably dumped about $10,000 into  building that up, at least.  At least.  I thought it was a lot more to be honest with you.  To the point it's at right there.  But, you know something, probably more, probably about $15,000 considering the camera, the fucking  computer shit, everything else.  It's a brilliant idea on Anthony's part because he's allowing access to his personal life.  No one does that.  All these reality shows, they're all fake reality shows. 
[00:37:00]  He's got listeners over there.  He's got girls.  He's got drinking.  He's got guns.  There's poker going on.  There's fucking pool parties, barbecues.  There's all kinds of shit going on that opens me up to the public, yet they see it as something  bad.  They see it as something else.  When on Mondays, I can't wait to get in here to find out the stories.  Yeah, the shit that's going on.  Actually, I hear some of the stories over the weekend.  I can't wait to ask Ann about it.  He brings other little tidbits from the weekend and that show. 
[00:37:30]  It's like, they just don't get it.  They don't get it.  Everything was going so well.  I want to stress that.  Leave it alone.  So why not leave everything how it is?  And God forbid our numbers start dropping.  Then you start looking like, wow, maybe it's because Anthony's broadcasting from his basement.  I would still argue no.  I would love to know how that would affect it, by the way.  But why do you have to fuck with things?  Why?  I'm sure I'll hear later how it affects it and why they're going to pull the plug and it'll 
[00:38:00]  be some fucking just load of shit.  Fine.  Then, you know, I'm taking myself off the grid.  I ain't interacting with nobody.  I'll do your stupid radio show for you and that's it.  That's it.  What about Twitter?  Is that going to be pulled?  What about videos that you take?  Like, I like posting videos of shit that I do off the...  Just yesterday, as a matter of fact, I went to the range.  I went to the fucking range.  I took some fucking shots there and I posted video. 
[00:38:30]  Is that over the line?  Because I'm showing, you know, part of my personal life?  I put it up online.  Twitter would be a breach of contract if they really want to play along.  Yeah, if you want to take it to the letter.  If you want to take it to the fucking letter.  All that stuff is a breach.  All of it.  Every single thing.  There's a problem.  It's just amazing.  I don't understand why, at every turn, they just make it harder and harder for us to do  what we know what to do.  I'm so pissed because, yeah, we know how to do this. 
[00:39:00]  We've been doing it a long time.  We know what makes the Opie and Anthony show work.  And the way it's being handled ain't it.  Ain't fucking it.  We would love to know who the rat is, too, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Somebody ratted me the fuck out.  So if someone knows, I'd greatly appreciate it because, oh, boy, do they have info on the broadcast.  Yeah, a little info on that.  Somebody went.  I have my theories.  Knew exactly who to go to.  I have my theories. 
[00:39:30]  Bob says, yeah, the whole board knows about it, everyone.  It was CC'd to the CEO of the company, and this one knows.  And everyone knew I was doing this.  And it came from, like, you know, the average listener, even a hater.  It would take them a little while to figure out, first of all, that I'm doing it.  Secondly, to what capacity I'm doing it.  Because I actually just got this together.  I haven't been doing this a while.  I just got this shit together, and they knew exactly who to go to with what, telling them 
[00:40:00]  what I'm broadcasting, what I'm doing, inside.  I'm thinking, mm-mm-mm, damn, somebody, mm-mm-mm.  Hello.  Am I on?  Great.  I guess I am.  Could be.  I don't know.  It could be.  Yeah, it could very well be, you know, because I did say the side on the air.  Yeah, they could have heard of it, yeah.  So they could have, but to actually then, I don't know. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, I'm not going to sound paranoid.  That isn't even the issue.  The issue here is I should be able to do this.  That's my fight.  That's the fucking issue.  I should be able to do this.  Things were going well.  What are you guys doing down the hall?  What are you doing?  You know, the listeners enjoy...  For real, what are you doing?  The listeners enjoy peering in the keyhole and seeing fucking what we're doing.  Not everything can be explained by a stupid pie chart.  It's this weird...  I can't...  It's a gray thing.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  It's a gray area.  All this stuff we do extra and broadcasting from the basement, it just...  Accessibility.  It just helps the show.  It's bringing bits to this show.  It's bringing material to this show.  It's accessibility to us that is unprecedented in radio.  People are so phony.  You know what it is?  People are so phony on the air that to show you as you really are, people would be like,  Ew.  Wow.  That isn't the guy on the radio. 
[00:41:30]  So we just open it up and go, No.  This is who we are.  Here.  Check this out.  This is what we do.  Yeah.  I've gotten a lot of emails that people are going, Wow.  It really is crazy.  Yeah.  I get the same ones.  I'm like, Yeah.  Yeah.  Anthony is a lunatic.  I'm like, Yeah.  I'm not much different off air.  I'm an idiot.  It just...  Dude, it is infuriating.  I'll say it.  This is the headline.  Why, when everything was going so well, you had to go down this road. 
[00:42:00]  If things started slipping, then you tweak and you look into things.  Yeah.  It's like programming 101.  Yeah.  Everything's going well.  So now you got us in a bad mood.  You're in a bad mood.  No one wants to make eye contact or talk.  I've been hanging around this place.  I ain't fucking hanging around this place.  11 o'clock, out.  Simple as that.  Out.  Now I don't know what the fuck.  If I walk in and have a meeting and I'm told there's no fucking way, then what? 
[00:42:30]  I got this goddamn studio in my basement and what?  I'll have just people come over and do a show and I'll sit and watch?  Yeah, that's what you'd have to do.  I guess I'll have to do that.  Hand him notes.  Or you could turn into a porn studio.  Danny?  Hand him notes.  It could be my show and then you could come on as a guest.  As a guest every so often.  I don't think I could be a recurring guest.  No shit. 
[00:43:00]  You could turn into a porn studio or something.  I could do that.  I could do that.  That would be some kind of breach too, I'm sure.  I'll just run fucking hardcore porno in there.  I'll fucking have people fuck for a lot of money and that'll be my new job.  What?  You can't film porn in New York.  You're not allowed to make porn in New York.  I'm not filming it.  I'm videotaping.  That's right.  Okay?  He's twittering it.  This is the argument they had in Boogie Nights.  I want to make a movie that people sit through and watch after they come.  That'll happen. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, that's going to happen.  Let's say hi to...  Stupid New York.  You can't film porno here.  Let's say hi to Craig in Indiana.  Craig.  I hate this thing.  Can I ask a question?  Hold on.  Craig.  And not in a gangway, how mad would the company be if you said, okay, I won't do it.  We're going to do one more show.  And then all three of us stood there and just jerked off onto crackers and ate them.  I'm not saying we should do that, but how mad would the company be?  Why shouldn't we?  Yeah, they'd be angry.  Craig.  Oh, God.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Craig.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:44:00]  I wanted to let you know I'm an XM subscriber and I bought the best series package.  And I have heard your guys promoted before, but they actually just promote the virus.  They don't actually say the name of the channel.  Well, we've been arguing that one, too.  We don't want the channel called The Virus anymore.  It means nothing.  Right.  The only reason we got a change to The Virus is because some dopey lawyer at XM that had  no business programming anything came up with the name High Voltage while she was on an 
[00:44:30]  Acceler train in first class.  What the fuck?  Hold on.  Hold on.  What?  What did you say?  What?  What did you say?  What did you say in the middle of my thing?  Sorry.  Well, no.  What?  It was important, obviously.  I said Elo thought it was a great idea.  I remember.  Elo's been gone a year.  I know.  I can explain shit now.  That was the big announcement, though.  The virus.  I was like, ew.  Well, Eric.  All right.  Thanks, Craig.  I'm just frustrated.  I'm sorry.  It's very frustrating. 
[00:45:00]  But a lawyer.  And this is the shit we always deal with.  Like, I remember the lawyer.  And she was a nice lady.  She was good at lawyering, but not programming.  She goes, hey, I'm catching a train.  We got the press conference.  So think of a name for your channel.  And, you know, we got to, like, you know, figure this out within the next day or two.  So I and I were like, well, obviously, let's go basic.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  She goes, she gets off the train.  And it's already in a press release. 
[00:45:30]  So obviously, she made a phone call while she was on the train.  Yeah.  What happened to the two days?  She goes, high voltage.  That's the name.  I'm like, that means shocking.  We're so much.  Are we shocked at times?  Shock jocks.  Yes, but we're not just shock jocks.  And the name just stunk.  There are people out there.  Awful.  They're known for being shock jocks, but that's all they do.  We're also very funny.  We're also thought provoking.  We're also very smart.  Charming.  Charming.  Things we don't like to mention on a daily basis.  But you hear it. 
[00:46:00]  You hear it on a daily basis.  The charm, you mean?  Yeah.  We don't have to tell.  It comes through.  It comes through loud and clear.  Yeah, fuck.  That's true.  The charm bleeds through like a tampon with blood on it.  So then Elo comes aboard, and we're like yelling on the screen.  I'm like, look, high voltage.  That means we're shock jocks.  I mean, from a company standpoint, that's not smart.  Marketing-wise, it's not smart.  We're way more than just being shock jocks.  And if you're a newer listener, why would you listen to a channel that you think is just a bunch of shock jocks when maybe you want thought-provoking material or funny material? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  He goes, oh, good point.  I'm like, all right, cool.  So Opie and Anthony?  No, the virus.  No, sorry.  Actually, we picked the virus at that point because they're like, no, you can't do Opie and Anthony, but we can do anything else.  I see ties.  What's this?  Are they yanking us out of here?  You're not supposed to wear a tie to a radio station.  They're having auto-asphyxiation parties in the closet.  Common.  Where's little Nicky?  When does he roll by?  I need a good laugh. 
[00:47:00]  830.  So then we've been arguing since the merge went through, like, can we finally turn this to the Opie and Anthony channel, please?  Oh, well.  Well, I am.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we do.  I don't fucking know.  I was scared to even call you.  Did you get my text at least?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I wrote just, oh.  That was my opening text to Anthony.  UGH.  If he wants to talk, he'll write back. 
[00:47:30]  After I hung up with Bob, I didn't call anyone back.  And I apologized to people that texted me and called me that I did not get back to.  Yeah, this is how it plays out in our world.  We get depressed, bummed out.  We're sad now, frustrated.  And everything was going so well.  So congratulations.  You really know how to manage us.  I went right to the fucking.  You put us in a fucking depressed tizzy.  I went right to the fucking range.  And shot.  Me and Keith.  And just, I blasted off more .50 caliber ammunition. 
[00:48:00]  I fucked my trigger finger up.  Oh, I see a band-aid on there.  Nice.  Yeah, I completely, I got to remember to wear my shooting gloves with that gun.  Because it is fucking ridiculous.  It is a ridiculous gun.  That, to me, was, that like calms me down, shooting.  It really does.  Incidentally, that is the injury of a lunatic.  Anyone who comes in with a band-aid on their trigger finger is a lunatic.  You shoot that thing a few, because I was blasting a lot of rounds out of that thing. 
[00:48:30]  And the trigger, really fucking, the kick is so bad on it that it pulls the skin back.  With the kick, it pulls the skin back on your pointer finger.  So I need my finger.  So I need, I need my shooting gloves, but I forgot them yesterday.  Well.  I remembered my little earmuffs and my glasses.  I was all safe.  Keith, Keith fucking, that was, this gave me a good laugh.  Keith fucking loaded up.  He had his Desert Eagle, .50 cal.  He lifted up.  Bam!  The casing comes out and hit him square in the forehead. 
[00:49:00]  Wow.  And left a dent and a big black mark, like it was Ash Wednesday.  Really?  On the front of his head.  That's God telling him he's got to go to church.  Holy shit.  You better go to church, my friend.  Holy shit.  He goes, yeah, that thing comes out pretty fast.  Um.  Yeah.  Well, Bob called me.  He was, he was trying to, you know, hunt you down, because you weren't answering your  phone.  I couldn't hear shit.  All I heard was, boom, boom.  And then he, he tells me what's going on.  I go, Bob, you better have a few glasses of wine before you tell Anthony that news, because 
[00:49:30]  that's not a good one.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he goes, I know.  I was living.  What do you suggest?  It's one of those things.  Oh, God.  I, you know, to, to wrap, to wrap it up in a neat little package, it's one of those  things that I assumed, silly me, that I could do for fun, uh, cause I, I, I'm a, and for  years I have been an electronic computer video geek.  This isn't something new.  This is something I just whipped out of my fucking asshole. 
[00:50:00]  I've been compositing shit.  I do, uh, I do, uh, 3D modeling, uh, um, uh, cause I'm so handsome.  No, I make, I make three-dimensional CGI models and, and incorporate them in video.  It's something I enjoy doing as a hobby.  So I figured, I have a lot of equipment.  Let me just get a board and some mics and I'll, I'll now enter the world of webcasting.  Cause it's fun.  Not, not, not charging money for it or anything, just having fun.  I didn't think in a fucking thousand years that it would really come down to them going, 
[00:50:30]  you can't be in your house and do something that you've done as a hobby, uh, that you  do for fun that actually helps with the listeners.  Uh, and it has to stop.  It just, it's beyond me.  Oh, he's going to explain though, which, Oh, I can't wait to hear the explanation as  to how this is detrimental to the show.  I want to hear how, what I do is detrimental to the company. 
[00:51:00]  I want to know how many points the stock will go up once I stopped doing, uh, the program  that I've only done maybe three times.  Like that is like, that is like in the middle of their radar screen, but advertising us on,  like Howard's channels is not like if you really want to weigh this shit out, are you  kidding me?  So now you got, now you got sad guys that are like just frustrated again.  Yeah.  More frustrated people. 
[00:51:30]  Things were going, I guess things were going too well.  We had to like figure out how to fuck it up.  And the funny thing is people think we always fuck it up.  Not really.  Not really.  No, we have.  Don't get us wrong.  It's always management with their dumb, stupid ideas that they think they know what the fuck's  going on with this show.  Look at the numbers.  That's what I go by.  If the numbers are going well, let's leave everything the fuck alone.  That's what, that's how I work.  If the show was like getting a little weird, then we, then we start tweaking.  But if things are working, guess what? 
[00:52:00]  We continue doing the same exact fucking thing.  On demand.  On demand.  What's that?  Uh, are you getting in trouble for that?  Uh, no, it's just, it's video of me shooting my gun.  I think I could fucking do that.  Can I?  I don't know.  Can I?  You better check.  Can I put video up of me actually firing, uh, my, my weaponry?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You would think I could.  I don't know.  It, just the fact that I gotta be in a meeting is bad enough.  Quite frankly, you know how I, I don't really enjoy, um, meetings. 
[00:52:30]  Especially when there are other meetings you should be going to.  Right.  Look for Desert Eagle.  Um, and, uh, it just, it's infuriating.  This was me yesterday.  Turn the volume up.  Wow.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  Look at your fucking face. 
[00:53:00]  Look at your face.  It's gotta be said.  This is, this is.  This is exactly why.  Hold on, hold on.  No.  No, this, it explains everything.  I see it.  This is right after he got the news about his life in the compound.  How angry.  Uh, you're getting, that's blowing off some steam. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  There's two other ones of the 45 and then the laser sight one.  Um, yeah, that was the Desert Eagle.  That thing is just sick.  It's so obvious, but I see it on your face.  Yeah, yeah.  That is you going to the range to get some frustration out.  Do you know how many fucking supervisors have seen that face as the last thing they see?  That fucking face was a lunatic.  I love it.  I absolutely love it.  Dude, it was, that was a fucking, a, a, a, a, a, a profile shot of, and you could just  see his lips.  And it was just the look of a psychopath. 
[00:54:00]  No, it's weird too.  Holy shit.  I don't, I don't know what the, I don't know what the deal is, but Howard does his, what,  Howard TV?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, it's, you know.  Does the company get a little taste of that?  I don't know.  I don't know what their deal is.  They don't know what our deal is.  Everyone's deal is their deal.  Yep.  But I'm just saying, I wonder.  And if they do, I bet you it's not, uh, not that much.  Maybe a little taste, a little tiny taste.  If a grave error was made in, um, the contract that we got, that doesn't allow, um, us to 
[00:54:30]  be on the internet at all.  On the internet.  In the year 2009, this company's telling us that we can't be on the internet.  I can't be on the internet.  Because Bob did say all the, uh, you know, the Twitters and the Facebooks and any videos  we're putting up anywhere is all in violation.  So you're telling us in the year 2009 you can't be on the internet.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face. 
[00:55:00]  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Face.  Why do they have to make it so, why do they have to make it so echoey?  Uh, so it sounds cool.  Yeah, it sounds really cool, actually.  You are fucking insane.  I love the shitty face on that.  If you see that face, the profile shot, it's a half-an's face, and it's just the hat and the glasses  and the focus looking straight ahead.  Yeah.  You gotta focus.  You're aiming.  Yeah.  It's true.  You must aim. 
[00:55:30]  Let's go shoot guns with it.  Oh.  Not a smile.  And then one more, the .45, the regular 1911, it's called.  That's a boring.  .45 caliber.  That's boring compared to what we just heard.  Colt 1911.  Very pretty gun.  This is the silver.  It's all silver.  Pretty gun.  And, of course, I do load a magazine faster than anybody else.  Look at these bullets going into the clip.  I defy anybody to load up a magnet that fast.  This is the fucking home video of everybody who is planning on checking out. 
[00:56:00]  Everyone is planning on checking out and going out in a blaze of glory.  Look at that face.  That's not a smile.  Nothing.  Because he's pissed.  This was a mere hour after he got the news.  Focusing.  Thinking of certain faces.  Jesus, Anthony.  Bravo.  Bravo. 
[00:56:30]  What a fucking kook.  The look.  You know, I never even realized the look setting going on.  Hold on.  Keep that.  Holy shit.  All right.  That does look a little crazy.  I got it missed.  Do you think?  I just found a picture.  I need a tweet.  Hold on.  Maybe if that picture was taken right after someone cut me in line.  That's one thing.  But after squeezing off eight fast rounds of a .45 cal, yeah, maybe that is a little crazy. 
[00:57:00]  Make it big for us.  Holy shit.  God damn.  Jesus Christ.  And it's after.  Can you rewind that a little bit, Danny?  Because after.  I have to focus the picture.  There's a moment where after you have that cocky, like, that's what you get, motherfucker.  Face.  It's after he shoots.  And he's like, all the little bullets are flying out.  Whatever they're called.  The casings.  Yeah.  Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching. 
[00:57:30]  Yes.  All these fucking.  Go to like ten seconds before that.  Watch the fucking face.  Before he turns and glares happily at the camera.  And here he's just shooting.  This is just it.  Now watch the nut.  Just a fucking cocky look as you're unloading that fucking magazine. 
[00:58:00]  I haven't realized.  Seven to seven millimeter.  I am in a studio of shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  It is insane looking.  I got to agree.  Anthony talks to his desert eagle.  It's pretty.  Oh, look at your action, Charlene.  So clean. 
[00:58:30]  It gave me boop-boop on my finger.  I know.  You had a domestic spat.  Yes.  A little spat was injured.  My trigger finger.  Holy shit.  Well, I just sent that one out.  Thank you, Ant, for that one.  Yeah, that is it.  Oh, Eric Logan checking in.  I guess Mr. Elo's listening in Chicago.  Oh, really?  I wasn't even checking my phone right now.  Is it a nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan?  How does he spell it?  Tell Ant that we have a meeting with HR.  Oh, you fucking asshole.  I'm following him on Twitter.  And Elo... 
[00:59:00]  He puts the twit in Twitter.  Didn't he used to be like an alcoholic?  Used to be.  Used to be.  No, it's a used to be, because now I think he's training for a marathon or something.  I was reading on his Twitter.  Are you shitting him?  Yeah, exactly.  A drinking marathon?  Yes.  Like a bar crawl where you run?  And now he's thinner than me.  What the fuck's going on in his world?  I guess that's what happens when you leave the world of satellite radio.  You know something?  You get really healthy.  Let me tell you.  Like, Elo was a bloated drunk.  Absolutely.  And the last time I saw him in any way, shape, or form, he was slender in a fucking tailored 
[00:59:30]  suit, looking like a million bucks.  Kind of looking like a skeleton with skin.  He looked like a million bucks.  That's what happens.  You leave the satellite radio world.  Yeah.  He goes, I'm going to get my shit together.  Yep.  And that he did.  He's working for the Hall of Harpo Industries there.  Let's take some phone calls.  Rick in New Mexico.  Rick.  Hiya, boy.  Morning, Rick. 
[01:00:00]  Hey, I've got to tell you something, man.  This is really pissing me off.  I think we need another Pat from Menachie running over another XM radio.  Yeah, that'll do it.  Uh-uh.  Well.  So, you're so solution-oriented.  Yeah, right.  Well, I'll try.  Let's say hi to Mike in Chicago.  Mikey.  Yo.  I think you can still do the show, Ann. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, really?  All the other shows on XM, they advertise their video podcasts.  What's the difference?  Yeah, like people do podcasts.  That are working for this company?  Yeah, all the talk shows.  Here's the only difference.  By the way, sorry, Ann.  Yeah, no problem.  Don't mention any names because we're...  Yeah, I don't want to be the fucking rat.  Because we're not rats like whoever ratted us out.  Because they'll probably fucking shut them down.  Right.  But I absolutely believe the only reason that I was called out on this is because I have the ability to get professional equipment. 
[01:01:00]  I mean, really.  You can look at it and go, wow, wait a minute, that's a broadcast mic.  He must be doing this broadcast.  Freak out.  If I had a little, you know, Logitech webcam with a built-in microphone and just sat like P. Diddy in front of his fucking thing and blurted out a few things for ten minutes, that would be fine. 
[01:01:30]  But I have a little pride.  I have a little pride in workmanship and decided I wanted to, you know, make something that looks a little good, that has nothing to do with the Opie and Anthony show, and have fun in my basement.  In my basement.  In my house.  My house!  Let me say hi to...  They fucking dug into my house and told me what I can and can't do.  Call it a crib.  Crib.  My crib, yo. 
[01:02:00]  Richie boy, why don't you turn down your radio and talk?  Come on.  Yeah, hey, what's up, boys?  What's up?  I just wanted to let you guys know that I joined XM about a year ago, and the reason I joined is because I heard about Opie and Anthony on the Internet.  So I was coming across sites, people talking about you guys on the Internet, and that actually got me to subscribe to XM so I could hear your radio show.  I had never heard of you guys before.  So the only thing that would come out of you guys having other things and other media out there is just to get people like myself to subscribe to XM. 
[01:02:30]  This is the one thing, Suits, I truly believe don't understand, because it's a gray area.  You can't really, you can't keep track of it.  There's no accounting of that.  You know, this, how do they find out about it?  Did someone slip upon live at the compound and go, you know what, I got to listen to, you know, the Opie and Anthony show.  Is it a dumb tweet that one of us put out there or a video we put up somewhere else? 
[01:03:00]  You know, all this is good for the show, but you can't, you can't take out a pie chart.  You can't, you can't throw this to the accountants and go, well, figure this out for me.  You just can't.  Accountants, lawyers, you can't, they don't, they can't interpret something that is just a natural occurrence of feeling.  Word of mouth, you know.  Right, right, word of mouth thing.  It's all about a slide rule with an accountant and fucking legal documents with fucking lawyers. 
[01:03:30]  You can't sit them down and go, no, you don't understand the passion.  That's what it is.  The passion of it all.  Really?  The fucking passion.  They can't understand that part of it.  And the passion of it goes down to wanting to do stuff once I'm done with the show that keeps the interest in the show.  It keeps people interested.  You know what's really weird as I sit here and think about this?  You are getting penalized.  Hear me out.  Uh-huh.  For doing extra.  Yeah, for doing homework. 
[01:04:00]  Most radio guys are lazy fucks that show up, literally, if their shift starts at 6, they show up at 6.  If their show is over at 10, they leave at 10.  Jimmy Norton.  They leave at 10.  Jimmy's very busy.  You are getting in trouble, which will mean we're all going to get in trouble because this is just the beginning,  for doing what's called extra stuff for our listeners.  For the listeners.  How does that make sense?  How does that make sense? 
[01:04:30]  Well, apparently we're going to hear how, later on.  I can't wait to hear how this is a problem.  We hang out with our listeners.  We do the podcast.  We're twittering about the show and our lives.  This is all extra stuff.  Yeah.  No one's doing this.  No one.  Not to the extent we are.  And now it's gotten to the point where you're in trouble and it's going to hurt the show because you decided to do extra.  Extra.  Yeah, extra.  Extra stuff.  I decided to take my own fucking money and time and put together a really nice little facility to have people come down and have some fun. 
[01:05:00]  And some things you're not, you know, most people don't get to do.  It's cool.  You're kind of just hanging out.  And it's safe to say, and once again, this is the thing they just don't understand.  Keep it above table and professionally here.  Anthony's live at the compound has probably added. 
[01:05:30]  You got the shit, Jimmy?  Great.  Oh, there you are.  Yeah, I see you're doing that duck walk.  It's added.  I'm trying to put a good number on it.  I would say at least 10 hours of material to the, you know, the satellite radio show.  Yeah, at least.  At least.  Probably more.  Talking about parties and everything else.  How is that bad?  Yeah, how is that bad?  How is that bad that it gets material?  That's 10 hours that, I don't know what we would have done with those 10 hours, to be honest with you.  There's only so many news stories and things you could do.  You know, we dig into our personal lives, and this is a big one. 
[01:06:00]  This is a biggie for Ant.  Do you want me to put fucking, you know, XM Sirius and then a phone number on the bottom,  on the ticker that goes on the bottom of my screen?  Do you want that?  Do you need me to do that so I can continue doing this?  You know, I just, it's something I enjoy doing.  Why can't I enjoy, I'm at my house.  Someone's suggesting you do the show with a mask on.  Dude, you should do that.  I'll just throw a mask on. 
[01:06:30]  You should do that.  Change your name.  Put a mask on.  Change your voice a bit with, you know, you've got the equipment.  Oh, I've got the equipment.  I'll just rattle it around a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is, you know, we go down this road, this is where we get in trouble,  but I think Mike can keep it sort of safe.  A little civil.  Mike in New York City.  Go ahead, Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Listen to this one.  Hey.  Oh, you did answer your own question.  You know, you're saying that nobody else in radio does the stuff that you guys do,  and that's the truth.  You have someone, let's call him Radio Edit, 
[01:07:00]  who does four-day weeks, is on vacation all the time, and offers no accessibility to his  listeners, and he's just an all-around douche.  So the fact that you guys do all this stuff for your listeners, that your numbers are good,  it's time to put a, let's say, gag order on you guys now.  So it's just, it's the same bullshit with these guys.  He does bring up a point.  You bring up a great point. 
[01:07:30]  He'll work four days, and I'm working extra.  Yeah, let me tell you, the Howard four-day-a-week thing is brilliant.  And, you know, I'm not going to lie to you, I hope we can get to that point someday.  But with that said, he is working four days, and he gets a shitload of vacation time.  We work five days, and we work, and we put in more hours on a daily basis, in general.  Yeah.  And then decided to do even more.  Even more.  Outside our satellite radio show, which I will challenge anyone, helps the show in the end, 
[01:08:00]  and we're getting in trouble for that.  Yeah.  How does that work?  When's the last time he reached out to his listeners?  What, a Vegas show in, like, 93?  Look, he couldn't even commit to Twitter.  When he found out we were doing the Twitter thing, and, you know, because he's all about  I invented everything, we were doing Twitter for months, and he goes,  Wow, I've got to get on this Twitter thing.  It's not even his Twitter.  It's a show Twitter. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, show Twitter, but...  He can't even, like, go all in there.  Look, I'm not even going to sit here and...  But it's not...  We're not trying to go us against him.  Trust me.  Yeah, it's not about that.  The four-day work week...  An example, yeah.  It's amazing.  The four-day work week is okay.  Yeah, I would love that deal.  I'm not going to lie to anyone.  They would never approach him with anything, you know, that he's doing.  Yet, I'm trying to do more for the show, and I'm being chastised, and my agent's being  called by lawyers, and they're making it sound like I've just signed a pen to deal 
[01:09:00]  with fucking NBC to do the Opie and Anthony show without anybody's permission or a cut  of money or anything like that.  This is all about just what I like doing for free for the listeners.  This isn't some side gig.  This isn't some moonlighting side gig that I'm doing for a few extra bucks that I'm cutting  them out of.  And I'm going to make that blatantly clear in the meeting that's going to go on later 
[01:09:30]  on today.  I'm not doing no meeting.  Because I need to fucking do this.  I'm not doing no meeting.  There's nothing that you need to say to me.  I'll be there for you, though, obviously.  I got to go because I got to fucking hash this out.  I got to fight for this.  I'm not going to say word one.  I don't need an explanation why you're going to promote the hell out of Howard on our channel,  but continue not to promote us whatsoever on his channels. 
[01:10:00]  I don't need the logic explanation of that.  I know what that's about.  We all know.  We all know.  What is it called?  It's the what in the room?  Synergy.  No, the what in the room?  The big.  Oh, the 800-pound gorilla.  Yeah, basically, it's the 800-pound gorilla in the room.  We all know.  So don't try to, like, spin it another way, you know?  Everything was going so well.  Like, in my world, when things are going well, you just keep doing the exact same thing. 
[01:10:30]  You keep doing it.  And when things are getting better, when things are actually getting better, you really leave  it alone.  You just told me that the listenership was way up.  So why would you come to us with all this stuff?  You know it's just going to, you know, just not be good for the show.  How do we, like, not go with this on the air?  And how do we now turn and try to go back to doing our show?  Yeah.  We will.  Trust me.  We're professionals.  Yeah.  But it's going to just be that cloud of piss mist.  Yeah.  Piss mist, as Adam Ferrara called it. 
[01:11:00]  I love that.  Piss mist in the room.  And it's hard to just, you know.  I love when you say that, as long as it's when you're referring to my shit.  It's just, it's hard to then, you know, bring the funny when I'm worried about, you know.  Last night, I get home, I'm annoyed at the whole fucking situation.  And I go downstairs, and I had just, oh, Danny, I had just cleaned up the whole place, too.  You were ready. 
[01:11:30]  I took all the wires.  You were ready for another broadcast.  And ran, I took wired zip ties and got all the wires all along the floor nicely.  I cleaned up everything.  It looks fucking great now in there.  And I'm like, I'm sitting there going, should I go on?  Should I do this?  Should I do, like, I don't fucking know.  I don't know what's going to get me screwed.  So, you know, now I got a meeting.  And I got a fucking meeting. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, God.  It's beyond me.  Yeah, I don't really, this keeps coming in like crazy.  And I don't want names, because we're not rats.  There's someone around here that's a major rat.  I don't even know how you live with yourself being a rat like that.  Matt in Connecticut, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  You know, you guys are exactly right, because there are a lot of broadcasters who not only 
[01:12:30]  do their show every day, but they're also doing weekly podcasts, daily podcasts, netcasts,  full cameras, and it's all free to download.  Right.  But, see, the broadcasters, and this is, I will argue this point with anyone.  When they do their video podcast, that whole world of material goes back to their regular  show.  We all know what the meat and potatoes is.  It's the Open Anthony show on Sirius XM satellite radio. 
[01:13:00]  We all know that.  But when I dip into a few things on the side, and Ant's dipping into a few things on the  side, it just brings more material to this.  Yep.  The breadwinner here.  Yeah, absolutely.  And that's what they're not understanding.  Okay?  Because corporate guys, they go to college, and they get a business degree, and they don't  understand creativity, and they don't understand how things really work.  Everything needs to have a chart. 
[01:13:30]  Everything needs accountability.  If they can't show it on a pie chart, they don't understand.  Yeah.  They don't understand.  I'll say it again.  It's a gray area.  It's word of mouth.  How do you get word of mouth out there?  Well, you do things like live from the compound.  You do a very aggressive Twitter page, and it gets people talking.  Like, wow, do you see the picture that Ope put on his Twitter?  Oh, from Open Anthony?  Oh, I haven't listened to those guys in here.  Hey, post that.  Hey, what's the link?  Well, here's the link.  Oh, wow.  And then all of a sudden it gets in their brain, like, you know what, I think I'm going 
[01:14:00]  to go start listening to them again.  That happens on a daily basis, but corporate guys don't understand that, because you can't  put a number on it.  No, they need some fucking number.  We understand the talent end of this.  There's always the talent and management side.  So just leave that to the people that know what the fuck they're doing.  I mean, you know, count the beans and leave us to what we know about our audience and our 
[01:14:30]  program and what is best for it, which then in turn is best for your company.  Other than that, you know, fucking go have lunch with somebody, for Christ's sake.  Go pick out new designer glasses, because that shows a lot.  Enough.  It must be weird when you go to lunch with corporate guys and they're all sitting around  a table with their designer glasses.  Can you imagine?  I told my dad when I was really young, like, I got it. 
[01:15:00]  I'm like, Dad, I don't know what I'm going to do in life.  I was just a dumb caddy.  I had ideas.  I go, I will never fucking wear a tie.  I don't understand that world.  And I know there's tie wearers that are listening to us, and I feel your pain.  Most of you guys are in hell.  I mean, let's be honest.  You should see these guys around here.  They all have designer glasses.  Imagine going to a restaurant, and there's a table of designer glasses, dudes.  What, are you handing over your really nice fucking business cards like in... 
[01:15:30]  It's the business card, yeah, like American Psycho.  Like American Psycho.  It's the business card of the new millennium.  It's that scene with designer glasses now.  Designer glasses.  Oh, my God.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Bunch of names.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, this is, uh...  And it's funny because...  See, I learned this in therapy.  Before I say something, I sit and think for a minute. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, you got to kind of go, mm, mm, mm, mm.  It's the filter.  Yeah, I'm starting to use a little filter.  We're still in the air, Jimmy.  I use a little filtration.  I am using a little filtration today because I know that the meeting is later, and there  will be no filter later.  Oh, yeah, of course not.  But now I don't want to be the guy that says something, and then they can then say, why  did you say that on the air, and divert from the actual subject, which is what's happened  in the past.  I've seen that one happen, where you're talking about something. 
[01:16:30]  You go into the meeting.  Now you're yelled at about what you said on the air, and it diverts attention from  the actual point.  Oh, yeah.  So that's why I want to keep this civil.  I don't think there's anything we said on the air that they can, like, point out.  No.  Because I'm not even going to listen to that part of it.  No.  All right, so went through the filter.  Some people like to think that this show is pretty much like other shows.  Yes.  This show is very different because of the point Wes is going to make. 
[01:17:00]  Wes in Pennsylvania.  How you doing, boys?  Man, that went through a very thick filter, by the way.  Very thick.  I just filtered water.  I got some shit out of water.  Try that at home.  Yes, Wes?  Yeah.  You know, what nobody understands in this whole process is that the reason why the fan base  is the fan base is that you guys bring us in like nobody else in this medium ever does  or ever has.  That's the whole thing with the technology end of it that's helped so much early on. 
[01:17:30]  I mean, the first show that was doing instant feedback.  And I, you know, bring that up not like a, wow, we invented it, but when the only way  to get through to a station was either the phone or the fax line, we had instant feedback  where people could comment in and we would read their comments on the air.  And now everybody has it.  People are calling it instant feedback.  We were stupid for not copywriting the name instant feedback.  Oh, we'd be rich. 
[01:18:00]  Because we were using it.  We would be rich.  Every radio show in America now does that.  That's what we were always doing.  We were the first.  We had a guy at NEW.  He didn't even know how to figure it out.  He goes, all right, give me in like a week.  Yeah.  Wow, this is a very...  I mean, now it sounds like basic shit.  Trust me, I understand that.  But 11 years ago, I think, he's like, wait, so you want a program where they could just  get right to you on the computer?  Yeah.  And they're like, why not use email?  It's like, no, we don't want to use email.  We want it to be instant and just popping up. 
[01:18:30]  It just pops on and scrolls as it goes.  And who was it over there?  He was Scott, right?  Yeah, I think the guy's name was Scott.  And Scott's like, all right, give me a week.  I think I can figure this out.  Now it's an easy thing.  You can figure it out.  But you got to go back in time a little bit.  But the access that we have to you guys has never been seen.  Even though you guys beat us up relentlessly as listeners.  You deserve it.  And you don't beat us up?  It's your show.  Go ahead.  And you don't beat us up.  I go home and take rape showers all the time because you fuckers. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, go ahead there, Wes.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm just saying, you know, we don't get this anywhere else.  And it's fantastic.  It is one of those things that just, you know, we've always done it, want to continue doing it.  And part of that now, since it's 2009, is using the top end of the technology, which is what we like doing and staying on because that's where the people are.  And if we're not allowed to do that, it's taking away from potential subscribers. 
[01:19:30]  It's taking away from the fans that are already there staying.  And it's taken away from the fans and us enjoying ourselves doing this and our other extracurricular activities that in no way interfere with the program.  Well, man, I'm funny.  I pull people in.  I pull people onto your mogulist and said, hey, look, you've got to check this guy out.  And if you like him here, you're going to love him on the radio.  That's how it works.  I would bet.  But see, when you go into these rooms with the suits and the designer glasses, you can't just say I bet. 
[01:20:00]  You have to actually have facts.  But I would bet.  Call me.  Yeah.  I would bet since Anthony's been doing Live at the Compound that a bunch of people have subscribed to the Opie and Anthony show.  Please talk about this in the meeting.  It's just a feeling I have.  Please talk about this in the meeting and then continually say according to Wes.  According to Wes.  Well, Wes brings up.  Yeah.  Wes from Pennsylvania.  He says.  No last name.  Just where he's from. 
[01:20:30]  You guys talk about being on top of technology and everything.  I pulled up the old WNEW page from 1999.  And you actually have a live studio cam and instant feedback.  And that was 10 years ago.  Semi-live studio cam.  There it is.  Because it was always freezing up because no one had enough bandwidth.  But we were working so hard on getting a camera that actually worked and gave video as it was going.  And, you know, we've always done this. 
[01:21:00]  And it's worked over the years.  But you should have seen it coming.  When they took away the pal talk from you, you should have seen that they were going to take that away from you, too.  Dude, they took the pal talk away from us, which I – we've had to take a lot of shit.  I'm like, how does that make sense if you give people a peek into some of the stuff we're doing on the radio show?  It's just going to make them want to be a part of the listening experience.  But, again, the lawyers who have no idea what it even is say, well, that's forfeiting video rights to the program. 
[01:21:30]  It's like, have you seen the camera?  It's an Anthony nostril cam.  I don't think it's really going to be on demand out there.  And when I'm a radio listener, my first thought is, oh, my God, I wish I could see that.  And we gave the people the ability to go, oh, my God, I wish I could –  Oh, wait, I could see that.  Yeah, when something's going on, we turn the camera around and go, yeah, here's E-Rock fucking getting something poor on his head, whatever.  Here's a peek.  It's not a high-def fucking seven-camera HBO shoot, you idiot.  Exactly. 
[01:22:00]  It's a webcam view of what was going on.  But they took that – I mean, the list of things they took away and they – you know.  Do you guys know that they took away from the original XM subscribers the ability to listen online without paying extra?  Oh, we don't even want to bring that on, my friend.  Whatever.  I mean, I used to go into my office all the time and turn you guys on when I got in there on the computer.  And I can't even do that anymore without paying extra.  I'll do it.  I'm sure there's a reason why they did that, I guess.  We'll have to wait and see.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  All right.  Well, I'm one of those annoying callers that have been on too long, so I'm punching out.  No, Wes, it's all about you in this meeting today.  Trust me.  According to Wes.  Yes, Wes says.  Call him Wesley.  Yeah, Jason Ellis is up helping us out and talking about the show.  I mean, there's been a bunch of channels around here that have been helping out the show.  That's Stalker Patty from the N.E.W. days?  Let me see it, Dan.  Holy shit, she never looked young.  That's 2001.  She never looked young.  Well, she was awful then.  She was in her 40s then.  Yeah, she was a mess.  Yeah, but in your 40s.  That was after her makeover, too. 
[01:23:00]  What makeover?  We gave her a makeover.  With a shovel?  Yeah.  They put a Rocky Dennis mask on her?  What the fuck is this?  How is that a makeover?  I don't know.  Imagine what she looked like before it.  I guess.  Maybe those are the before pictures.  I have no idea.  I can't tell.  That's how you know you're an ugly woman when they don't know what the before and after  picture is which is which.  That's a makeover.  What the fuck?  Let's say hi to John in Connecticut.  Hey, there's Jan.  Hey, boys.  Hey. 
[01:23:30]  I just noticed something the last couple of weeks.  Hope he's been on fire.  Yeah, we're trying to put him out.  He's in a great mood.  And now the suits are going to ruin everything.  I hope they don't get it at Twitter.  I like taking dangerous bike rides with Opie and getting stuff in track.  Yeah, exactly.  I like staying up for 12 hours with Anthony.  It makes me want to listen to the XM show that much more.  Right.  Yeah, because then we bring this material to...  Ah, whatever.  Yeah.  We're like a broken record.  Now we're rehashing.  I know.  And now Opie's going to have to go to two therapy sessions just to get over this. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, we're crazy for thinking that we know more than those guys.  I'm sorry.  Are we even allowed to go to therapy?  I'm sorry.  That is actually talking.  I don't know.  And we're conveying like our...  We're doing...  We've talked about our past on the show.  I didn't realize you had to like, you know, sign away your soul to work for this company.  Dude, I was astounded.  I think we just made the official deal with the devil.  The deal with the devil.  I think that's what we did.  I'm in my house.  Speaking of which, when is little Nicky going to be working? 
[01:24:30]  Where's little Nicky down the hallway?  Some people are saying he's the insider.  He's the host.  Little Nicky.  He just innocently walks down the long hallway past our studio every day.  But he's listening in.  I'm listening in.  Little Nicky.  I know.  I got to go tell the board.  What a creep that guy is.  He probably just goes to all the empty studios and smells the seats.  Fucking weirdo.  Ass.  By the way, we have 15 guys working for us behind the scenes.  If someone doesn't get a picture of little Nicky today... 
[01:25:00]  Little Nicky.  We fire Sam.  Oh, if Sam gets it.  Yeah, we have to, you know, not just say we fire somebody.  Because he's beloved.  Yeah, if Sam gets fired.  We'd all feel bad if Sam got fired.  Sam gets fired.  Look at Sam running down the hall trying to find little Nicky.  Quack, quack, quack, quack with those duck feet.  We should make him run a 5K.  What awful feet and legs he has.  What do you think would happen to Sam if he ran a 5K like that?  His feet would fall off, I think.  He would have to have double hip surgery.  His feet would fall off. 
[01:25:30]  Is that the, uh...  Those are screen caps from the, uh...  Who is that bitch?  That's called lesbianism.  Remember the days when we were allowed to do that without putting...  Oh, my God.  Without, like, having curtains and shit?  Whoa.  Yeah, I remember those days.  Look at that.  Oh, yeah.  Chicken all naked and shit.  Oh, shit.  All the lesbian couch.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that...  They're grinding on each other.  Having pictures and video of the show like this didn't turn anyone on to a show.  Why don't we help?  Why don't we do that again?  Oh, yeah.  Because we're defeated.  What would the lawyers and management say? 
[01:26:00]  What would management say?  Man, today's the day we needed that, uh, soundbite.  Yeah.  Why would we have it in front of us?  From my house.  Where my wife sleeps.  Where my children play with their toys.  Yes.  I didn't know he would give me tits, Tom.  A mic.  Is that guy the rat?  Halfway down the long hallway. 
[01:26:30]  He's on a phone.  E-Rock?  No.  E-Rock.  He smells like a rat.  He eats rats.  And there's nothing else to eat.  That's a rat.  He's the fucking...  He's the fucking modern-day penguin.  Aw.  Hey, E-Rock.  Oh, it's...  You're gonna make me look bad now.  Let it be known that E-Rock's making me look bad.  He did tell me that it's on my thing.  See?  What would management say?  I now got one for you, E-Rock, for pointing that out.  Okay, faggot!  What's next?  You fuck. 
[01:27:00]  Uh-oh, is this broad?  Is she the rat?  Are you the rat?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Her and Kenny are talking.  I don't like it.  Oh, Kenny will get to the bottom of this.  Kenny's an investigator.  He'll find out who the rat is.  I'm investigating.  Is Sam the rat?  She's probably saying, look, just take that dumb look off your face.  It's bothering everybody.  I can't help it.  I would need a knife.  Get Sam in here.  Sam.  I think Sam's the rat.  Yeah, I did too.  Sam's a rat.  Oh, there was the knife girl.  Hold on a minute. 
[01:27:30]  Go near Jimmy.  Oh.  Checking this motherfucker for wires.  Oh, maybe someone's wired.  Checking his hair.  That big puff in the back of his head.  No wires in that hair.  His hair looks like wires.  Who's the rat?  Who's the rat?  Kenny, are you the rat?  Damn rat.  Thank you.  Kenny wouldn't rat.  I don't eat cheese.  Kenny don't sing.  He's a rat.  This guy down the hall works for another show.  He's on a cell phone.  Is he the rat?  That's right.  He is.  He's bald, bothering everyone.  He definitely works for another show. 
[01:28:00]  I know that for a fact.  Is he the rat?  Is he on a cell phone looking at us?  Back a ways.  Jesus.  Wow.  God.  Look at us.  We look like fucking idiots.  I know.  That's what we are.  Good reason for that.  We look exactly like what we are.  By the way, that was a WWF promotion.  Wasn't it?  Oh, XFL road show.  Yeah.  With WWF guys.  Wow.  Danny's going back in time with some of these pictures, man.  Oh, Mars.  Are you the rat? 
[01:28:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mars, prove you're not the rat.  Mars.  Are you the rat, Mars?  I don't trust that motherfucker either.  What?  That one right there.  Yeah, why is he hanging outside the studio 20 feet away taking a cell phone call?  Is he the rat?  Oh, shit.  He's been talking into the air.  Oh, shit.  Mars, you're just speaking like.  No, no, no.  Leave.  Mars.  Thank you.  I know where he's going, and we like Mars.  Of course.  We want him to stay around.  Yes. 
[01:29:00]  Let's say hi to Rob in Richmond.  Rob?  I'll tell you guys, the rat is David.  It's young David.  You think Dave's the rat?  Yep.  The whole family rat.  Because, why would you allow him to do an alternative broadcast?  Oh, wow.  I saw it.  I saw it on the wall.  Oh, excuse me to allow that.  Oh.  What?  Look who's on WPIX.  Oh, Michael Emerson.  Ban from Lost.  Yeah, Michael Emerson.  What's he doing?  Is he doing our show today?  I thought he was supposed to come in. 
[01:29:30]  I thought so, too.  He's in New York.  What happened?  He lives in New York, I think.  Oh.  We're working on him.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Maybe I could get him from my basement.  How funny would that be?  I get A-list guests.  Fucking Tom Cruise is in my basement.  In the closet.  Someone's admitting their jerk-off fantasies.  And he's shirtless.  I was just trying to think of a big star.  Jim Norton in my basement.  That's right.  See?  Are we going to take a break, I guess? 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, let's do that.  By the way, I want to thank Anthony because the picture of you right after you firing the  guns is doing very well on my Twitter.  I got it tweeted, too.  Well, I got to thank Jim Norton for pointing it out because, to me, I look at that and just  Very well.  It never occurred to me how crazy I do look.  Oh, it's amazing.  During those clips.  This could be the most viewed picture.  And I got some good ones.  You should have showed a little cleavage and then it would have put it over the top.  Pictures with cleavage. 
[01:30:30]  That looks like a security camera right after the shooting.  That looks like a fucking video game character.  I looked into the camera.  Oops.  After the break, we're going to get into some other things, hopefully.  But trust me, this is going to be the general field of the show today.  The general malaise of the show will be this.  Yeah, way to go.  Way to know the show.  Everything was going so well.  You had to do something to get a distraction going.  Fucking lawyers.  Getting us frustrated.  You frustrated.  Called my agent.  The fans frustrated.  Fuck this! 
[01:31:00]  Everyone's frustrated now.  Way to go.  Just when you were telling me Friday how things were going great.  You couldn't just leave everything alone.  Fuck.  Fuck!  Damn it.  Where's a fucking billion dollars?  It's time.  Play that lotto.  I need to start a media company.  How much do you need?  I don't know.  Try it from your basement.  See what happens.  Shut you right the fuck down, man.  I was starting small.  Look at that.  After the break, we get into this. 
[01:31:30]  I'm usually drunk when I do this.  Here we go.  I've got a surprise now, especially...  Actually, it's going to take a while to build.  I'll tell you this much.  Yesterday, Eddie Money was in the studio.  He was a great guest.  Wonderful guest.  We isolated Derek's track as he was singing along to Eddie Money.  Oh!  Yeah.  And it's nice.  It's really good, E-Rock.  It's funny, yeah.  Okay.  Okay, faggot!  What's next? 
[01:32:00]  Pointing out my mistakes.  How dare you?  Opie and Anthony.  Checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Boy.  Exile on Main Street released 37 years ago.  I was just looking down.  Holy shit.  And happy birthday to Yogi Berra.  How old is Yogi?  How old is Yogi?  84.  Wow.  Cleveland moves on in the NBA playoffs. 
[01:32:30]  What's L.A. Houston doing?  L.A. Houston.  I don't know.  L.A.'s going to win that series.  It's going to be...  It's going to be the...  I don't even know.  I don't have it in front of me.  They were losing one-nothing.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  I haven't watched the NHL playoffs or NBA playoffs this year.  And I like that type of thing.  I really want LeBron James to get his championship, though.  I think that would be cool as shit.  And then I had a thought.  He should re-sign with Cleveland for a couple of years.  See how good this team could be. 
[01:33:00]  And then he moves on to the big city.  That's what I'm thinking.  I should be on Mad Dog Show.  Oh, that's why he was on TV.  Cat Stevens, and that's how I know him.  Youssef...  Youssef Islam.  Youssef Islam is playing his first U.S. show in 33 years.  That's why he's on Fox locally.  Really?  Why do you have to name itself after the religion?  That's like calling myself Jim Christian.  Yes.  Or Jim Orthodox Greek.  Silly.  Jim Catholic. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Oh, by the way...  Silly.  Hey, Anthony Jew.  But I'm...  I'm a Catholic.  Cat Stevens.  Now, is he going to do the hits?  Or is he just going to play like...  Oh, he did it already.  Los Angeles last night.  What did he do?  Did he play...  His first performance in 33 years.  Did he play the hits that people know?  Or does he just play like crappy Islamic...  Does he go like...  Boing, boing.  Call to prayer music.  I don't know.  76 was the last show in the States.  Trombones led the big parade. 
[01:34:00]  Da-da-da-da-da.  Bo-bo-bo.  Boo-boo.  Boo-be-boo.  Ba-bum.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Ba-da-da-da.  Ba-da-da-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  See what you did.  Congratulations.  I got some hot news, by the way, if you want sexy news.  What do you got there, Jimmy?  Um, in, uh...  Wait.  Oh, no.  Ah, Partridge Family Bomb to pose nude at 75.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  That rocks.  No way.  Shirley Jones, this is a rumor, is going to pose in Playboy 75. 
[01:34:30]  Her husband is trying to get her in.  Why?  Well, he said that she's still really hot and that 75, she's a natural beauty.  Wait, is she doing it or they're still talking?  They're talking because she wants to be the oldest one.  Like Nancy Sinatra was 54 and Vicky Lomato was 51.  And now they want to just jump 21 years and make Shirley Jones.  And I think they're going to have a contest.  Can you tell the difference between her gums, armpits, and vagina?  Who's the oldest woman that posed nude on our show? 
[01:35:00]  Patty.  That's it.  Nope.  No.  No, Jim.  No.  Was it that woman that played the piano?  No.  God.  Think.  We had an old stripper that used to do our show.  Sandy Kane?  No.  We need somebody that really knows this show better than us.  Better than we do.  There's a lot of them out there, too.  We had a lady.  She used to strip for us. 
[01:35:30]  She was really old.  And then we brought her out to one of our live gigs.  Help me out.  I'm the only one who remembers this.  I cannot.  She had brown hair.  Long brown hair.  I can't remember the live gig.  I remember.  But I couldn't tell you who she was or anything.  Her boobs held up.  And I think she was well into her 70s.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Somebody help me here.  I don't remember the name at all.  I remember the gig.  I remember that.  We brought her out, and they lost their mind.  I think we went to, what was that joint on Long Island? 
[01:36:00]  Mulcahy's.  Mulcahy's.  I think we brought her to Mulcahy's back in the day.  I wouldn't want to see Shirley Jones, like, in her prime naked.  Never, right?  Like, she knows.  She just, no.  And a woman I know was accused in California of making more than $8.5 million.  Wait, wait.  Can we go back to the other story?  Sure.  When you said 75, did you say 70 years too late?  No.  Oh, okay.  Because that's a great line.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, then Jared in Boston gets credit.  Because then he writes, oh, Uncle Paul. 
[01:36:30]  Who do you know?  What do they do?  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm all curious.  No, you started something, but I'm trying to get the answer to the other thing, but that's  fine.  No, no.  It was just, I just, we have one of our stories today.  It's a woman accused in porn star prostitution ring.  And her name is Michelle.  And they said she made more than $8.5 million from an online prostitution business.  I met her and her husband in Florida a few years ago. 
[01:37:00]  They're fans of the show.  Her husband is a guy who does radio and he's a huge fan.  Did you watch her fuck?  No, I would have, but she hooked me up with a girl.  Would it have been, yeah, I was just going to say, would it have been $7,999,000?  No, I didn't have to pay.  You put him over the $8 million mark.  $500.  No, she threw me a free one.  She's like, it's my treat.  She sent me a girl.  Yeah.  And she probably would have sent me more, but I only took the one.  But I had sex with her.  I want to say it was in Vegas.  And now she's in trouble? 
[01:37:30]  Fuck yeah, $8.5 million.  That's a nice dime.  Yep.  For a prostitution ring.  She was sexy, too.  Michelle was really sexy.  How'd she get nailed?  I don't know.  Fucking Florida.  They had nothing else to do.  How'd she get nailed?  There was a rat.  Someone ratting.  You can't do sex from the compound if you're doing sex from the compound, yeah.  It was in Boca Raton, Florida.  Ah, Boca.  I don't go for that.  $50,000 or more to spend the night with adult film stars, models, and actresses?  Where'd you hear that?  Some of these broads were getting $50,000 for one night? 
[01:38:00]  An overnight, maybe?  But who?  Like, how?  Is that a Boca Raton, Florida woman, is accused of charging clients $50,000 or more to spend  the night with adult film stars, models, and actresses?  Where did you get that?  Why don't I have that fucking paperwork?  Why don't we have her on the show?  I don't know.  I think we did a phone call after you ran into them.  Maybe.  I have a weird Rain Man memory for this crap.  But I vaguely remember that we might have talked to her after you brought this to the 
[01:38:30]  show, Jimmy.  I'd love to know who.  We probably did.  I want to know, because I didn't have to pay, so I don't know if she charges people or not,  because I got it for free.  $50,000.  I want to know who's getting $50,000 for the night.  Unless it's someone like, I don't know if Savannah Sampson does privates, or I don't  know if, who's the big one.  She's married to the guy from the band.  You guys know who she is.  She was supposed to come in, and he called in.  There was like a whole thing.  God damn it. 
[01:39:00]  Jade Patrick.  Tara Patrick.  Oh, okay.  And I don't know if she does them or not, but I guess somebody on her level would get  that kind of money for an overnight.  $50,000.  It would have to be an actress from Hollywood.  Yeah.  And even then, what is a girl going to do?  Uncle Paul.  Same one.  Of course.  Old DF.  That might be worth $50,000.  There's no pussy worth $50,000 a night. 
[01:39:30]  None.  What can you get?  I agree with you.  What can you get for $50,000?  Let's go $5,000 a night.  It's going to give you a hot girl overnight.  The ability to do it.  If you have oil money.  There are people that have fucking apartments in the Time Warner building as second homes.  Yeah.  They have $30,000,000 apartments as a second home.  I mean, that's the kind of money people live with.  And you want to say, I want to fuck that actress who's in that show. 
[01:40:00]  I like her.  And you know, you throw 50 Gs at her and she'll fuck you.  That's the power thing, man.  Let's say me paying a massage girl an extra $200 to get jerked when she doesn't like jerking  people, but on a much different level.  Yeah.  It's money that we can't comprehend.  Yeah.  That they just throw away, like people throw away money to have a little extra for lunch or something.  So many nickels and dimes.  Just because there's a lot of people out there that are like me and can't move on until they  get the answer.  Sure.  Her name was...  Whose name?  The stripper. 
[01:40:30]  Oh.  Virginia?  Really?  Hold on.  How old was she?  She was 72 years old.  That's coming in from Jeff in Staten Island.  The oldest broad to ever strip naked for us.  Wow.  And let me go to David in New Orleans.  Santa Cain isn't older than that?  David.  That wasn't the old lady the first day I was there fucking...  No, that was Fran.  Yeah, Frantic Fran.  Can we get some Frantic Fran audio?  Frantic Fran.  Where's Z-Ross?  What did she do?  She played piano, right?  Yuck.  She was hilarious.  I liked her.  David in New Orleans.  She's probably dead now.  Good evening. 
[01:41:00]  Hey, David.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, open hand.  I got a picture of you guys holding each one of her tits by your heads.  Both of you.  Fantastic shot.  Big shot.  Ah, that must be wonderful.  Really?  Could you send that to us?  I don't remember this, but was her name Virginia?  Virginia.  And she was an old stripper, right?  Oh, yeah.  I think we started throwing change at her as she was trying to dance or something.  And then she's getting down, picking up change, and she made a lot of change that day. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  There's no way to spin that to make it sound profitable.  Yeah, because then the audience started throwing...  Oh, no, that was at Volcage.  Yeah.  They started, like, ripping change at us.  And it was like, well, maybe that wasn't a good idea.  Yeah, quarters are coming, flying up like bullets at the stage.  Ow.  I'm just thinking about how much trouble I could have gotten at the time we were at Mulcahy's,  and I was talking, and I had my dick resting on that girl's leg.  That came up recently.  Oh, my God, yes.  And I had forgotten it to you guys when he mentioned it recently, and I'm like, I was  talking to a girl with my dick on her, just to make you two laugh.  Oh, it made us laugh.  It was at the bar. 
[01:42:00]  We barely knew Jimmy, and all of a sudden, Jimmy's, like, all excited, like, look, look  down, look down.  That is a criminal charge right there, my friend.  And we looked down, and he's got his dick out, and it's up against a girl.  On her, she had jeans on.  And then the other thing that had me fucking crying, laughing, was you were just carrying  on conversations with your ball bag pulled through your zipper.  Oh, yeah.  You just had your ball bag pulled through the brain.  It looked like gum.  It was doing the brain, yeah, it looked like gum.  It really looked like a piece of gum.  And he was just talking to people, hey, how you doing?  And I got blown on the bus. 
[01:42:30]  We took a bus out there.  Oh, and she spit it in the fucking...  She spit it on top of the keg.  In the ice.  She spit it in the ice.  And then the fucking beers were floating around in.  Yeah.  So no one could have beer anymore.  I was fucking giggling the whole ride back.  All of a sudden, it looked like a cold egg white omelet.  Oh, it was hard.  In the water.  Are you the rat?  Are you the rat?  No.  I'm questioning everybody that walks by our studio today.  Where's little Nicky?  No.  I want to see little Nicky.  I can't wait.  That rat gerbil.  How excited are we going to be when we see little Nicky?  I know.  Little Nicky walking down the hallway. 
[01:43:00]  Oh.  Oh, I got to walk down the hallway.  Hallelujah.  The pictures of them are great.  Oh, by the way, the staff realizes they don't get a picture of little Nicky today.  Sam's fired.  That's a real thing.  Yeah, yeah.  That's going down.  You got to get a picture of little Nicky.  This with Sam.  David, all right.  So her name's Virginia, and we're hearing that she was 72 years old.  Hey, was I on with number nine?  Oh, what do I get as a prize?  Dude, we don't even have a fucking prize closet.  Something we brought up a while ago. 
[01:43:30]  Thanks, man.  It's Mitch.  I mean, how stupid is that to have actual prizes to give away to good calls?  Little Nicky.  I don't even do the voice well.  I just want to do it all day.  Oh, you could do it all day.  You can't talk like little Nicky.  Of course, Jay Moore does a great little Nicky impression.  Well, doesn't Jay do well?  He's the king of impressions, and he's taking on all impressionists.  I'm with you, Jay.  I'm in your camp.  I want to manage you as you take on all the big competitors. 
[01:44:00]  He does these impressions.  You'd swear it were the real people.  Dean Edwards blew him off, you know?  He was ready to do his Tracy Morgan for Dean Edwards, and Dean Edwards does a great Tracy,  but I haven't heard from Dean Edwards since.  Or Tracy, for that matter.  Well, yeah.  Well, that's what happens when you become a big star again.  You blow off the people that you really like and had fun doing their show.  I don't understand that one.  And I still like Tracy, but what?  Tracy, what the fuck?  I had him booked for The Basement.  Did you?  Yeah.  Did you really?  Pass that up. 
[01:44:30]  Literal Jim.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Oh.  The only person ever booked for The Basement.  Oh, literal Opie.  I don't know what the fuck.  The only person ever booked for The Basement is Danny.  He's constantly booked.  You know what?  One of the reasons why I didn't do it, because I sort of felt like, let it be Ant's thing,  and then in my stupid mind, I'm like, then, you know, management will pretty much leave  it alone.  Oh, leave it alone.  Yeah.  I think if you and I are all of a sudden doing another show from your basement on a regular 
[01:45:00]  basis, then I'm like, oh, they might.  But it was a whole separate thing.  Silly me.  Yeah.  I thought I'd be able to just go down there and have some fun.  And also, I didn't do it, because I was scared shitless to be in your house.  Some people are quite frightened, but they loosen up quickly.  The reason I brought up Virginia, because of the Shirley Jones.  Virginie.  Yeah.  Maybe being in Playboy as the oldest broad, naked.  Virginia was 72, and I'm thinking, maybe we get the word out and see if we can set a new  record.  Older.  Set a new record. 
[01:45:30]  Old is broad to be naked on the O.P. and Anthony show.  I think the current age is 72.  Let's say we went to Shirley Jones in studio to see if she can pick up a hammer with her  vagina.  Off the floor, standing up.  Or swing a medieval mace.  I want to see her swing a mace with her vagina.  In this economy, it might be good to, it might be easy to get some old broad.  Maybe she's, you know, chowing down on the cat food, wants a nice, wants something nice  teeth.  Someone's grandma out there has Alzheimer's.  Just bring her in here and make believe you're going to, I don't know, a fucking antique 
[01:46:00]  shop.  Yeah.  This is wonderful.  She's all naked.  Oh, God.  How horrible that thing.  She has no idea where she is or what she's doing.  Just tell her you're bringing her to a place where they want to hear how much things used  to cost when you were young.  You know what?  I'm fucking naked.  Fuck this.  Fuck this.  I'm pretty naked when you talk.  Fuck this, like, beating around the bush.  $1,000 cash if someone could beat 72 naked.  Completely naked in our studio.  That's great.  1G.  I got the 1G.  A G.  For you, my friend. 
[01:46:30]  Oh.  Wow.  Do we really want to see that?  Her boob held up, though, man.  Yeah, no, it's flopped over the top of a bra.  Yeah, but she's like 80.  But if you take that bra off, it's still being supported.  Fucking awful.  That is horrible.  See, the big boobs are for the young.  There's a lot of...  That big, brainy-looking, veiny boob.  There's a lot of things that are made for the young.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  Danny found some elderly porno, and there's an old couple smiling, like, from the neck  up, you would swear that was a cruise ship photo. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  They're just laying out on the deck, smiling.  Is she grabbing his hog?  And she's jacking him off.  She's got the left hand on the hog.  Yeah.  Look, man, what do you think happens to old porn stars?  I don't know.  Do you think all of a sudden they become...  I think those are just regular people.  You think?  Regular people.  They're talking about that fucking colonial pen insurance as she's jacking them off.  Final expenses can really take their toll.  Final expenses. 
[01:47:30]  Final expenses.  What a great way to phrase it.  Oh, I know.  They use that one all the time.  While you're rotting in a box, your children are burdened yet again with you.  Yes, you're still a burden.  Kevin from Connecticut.  He writes, oh, this feedback is ridiculous.  They better shut down the feedback.  It's too popular.  It's on the internet.  It's too popular now.  I don't even know where...  Oh, here it is.  No.  God damn it.  Stop the show for Kevin's dumb...  God damn it.  Oh, damn it.  My mom is only 69.  He's mad.  I would have brought his mom in. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, we're looking at 72 or older.  73 or older, I guess, right?  That's tough.  That's bringing your grandma down for the most part.  Yep.  That's bringing grandma down.  Yep-er.  Let's see how to Matt in Tampa.  Matt?  Yo, Opie.  Anthony.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Oh, you got to start watching the damn NHL playoffs.  You're missing some fucking awesome hockey games.  Yeah, and we go game seven with the Caps, right?  Oh, you missed a hell of a game last night. 
[01:48:30]  Four minutes left in the game.  Penguins come back and tie it.  Two minutes left, they blow a power play, go to overtime, and lose it.  And then you got the Chicago Canucks game last night.  Fucking seven to five final score.  Boy, I think there's a place where you could...  Seven to five?  I think there's a place you could listen to NHL playoff hockey, but I don't really remember.  I don't know where it is.  I don't really know where it is.  I forgot.  I forgot.  And it sounds like it would be a great listen, because these games are amazing. 
[01:49:00]  And then Caps go into game seven with the Penguins.  God, I forgot where you could listen to this.  Maybe I'll figure it out.  It must be on that serious programming.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  Let's go to Adam in D.C.  Adam.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Hey, boys, I just thought I'd let you know, I was flipping over to Howard's show for a  minute there.  I got a little cross-promoting.  That's what I was going to say.  Yeah, sure.  No problem. 
[01:49:30]  But Fat Boy Hardy, he's getting a little big for his britches, man.  He's throwing out jokes about the O&A show having no listeners.  They had a guy on that was trying to plug his website.  And he goes, do you mind if I throw that out there?  He goes, well, if you throw it out like Gary's pitch, it'll land about where the O&A show is.  And no one will hear it.  Anyway, just being a prick.  Yeah, but we'll be team players, you know.  Whatever.  I don't care what anyone says anymore, to tell you the truth. 
[01:50:00]  It's all just actions that are the big thing.  I don't give a shit.  If you want to perpetuate this fucking bullshit, fucking back-and-forth crap, I'm bored with  it, to tell you the truth.  I'm bored with that battle.  What more could be said?  Yeah, I'll sit down.  Enough.  Who cares?  I'll sit down with anyone and hash it.  Not anyone, trust me.  But I'll sit down with the big guy and go, all right, what's your problem still after  11 years? 
[01:50:30]  Let's go.  Let's get into it right now and see if we can hash this shit out.  Seriously.  Later on, you know, in the meeting.  Yeah, that's when I'll have shit to say.  Oh, yeah.  We're not too distracted, no?  We've got a meeting where faces will be turning red.  What time do you think the face turns red?  Right at 11?  11.05, maybe?  Yeah.  Maybe it'll be like...  It's going to happen fast.  Let's go to Fran in Iowa.  Fran?  Good afternoon, boys.  Fran?  Hi, Fran. 
[01:51:00]  How you doing?  Good.  Everyone is bummed that their moms aren't old enough.  I know.  What's up, Fran?  That's what I'm saying, too.  My mom's always 71.  Oh.  Oh, we need 73 or better, I do believe.  Thanks, boys.  All right.  Love yourself.  And no, you can't get two, like, you know, 37-year-olds.  People are saying that.  Eddie Money in studio yesterday.  Yes, he was.  And he was great.  And you know what I learned yesterday from Roland? 
[01:51:30]  Roland's back in town, by the way.  We passed on Eddie Money twice.  We're fucking idiots.  Roland had to tell us that, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He rubbed it in because Roland gets frustrated because he's a great booker,  and I think he's looking for work right now,  and if SiriusXM doesn't hire him, they're just stupid.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, I'm just putting a plug in for Roland.  He's amazing.  He really is.  And he used to get frustrated because he would, like, suggest guests,  and we're like, I don't know.  We're not feeling it. 
[01:52:00]  So this is his way of going, see, assholes, I know what I'm doing.  Yeah.  Because the word got back to him that Eddie Money was on the show and killed.  Oh, and he had to rub it in.  So he couldn't wait to write and go, look, idiot.  I suggested him twice, and you said no.  And I'm not going to mention who pushed for him behind the scenes,  because that's not important.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  Who was that, Jimmy?  Oh, toot toot their own horn, not me.  Who's getting a bell today?  I want a bell.  Give yourself a bell!  Still want to play that game?  No. 
[01:52:30]  Never did.  I don't want a bell.  No, not the bell game.  Oh.  I did that because of what he did.  Why didn't I do anything?  Do you want a bell?  No.  Because I so much.  You want to take credit for the Eddie Money interview?  You can.  No.  Not at all.  You want to take credit?  No.  Oh, he does.  Give yourself a bell!  I don't want credit for him.  Are you the rat?  Or Liddell or Rappage?  Are you the rat?  God, if you're the rat, god damn.  I don't mind rats anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah, who's that?  Drop a nice cheese log on our faces. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, it is.  Are we allowed to even comment about how hot the chick is that just walked by our studio?  No.  Or is that an HR issue?  Don't say it.  So Eddie Money was in.  He did a great interview, blah, blah, blah.  He sang a couple songs, right?  Yes, he did.  He did pieces of songs, which were good, right up to the chorus, and then they stopped.  Yeah, we liked that.  We liked that.  Little clips of the hits.  We definitely liked that.  Tommy Shaw.  Tommy Shaw did the same thing.  He was very good.  But for real, Derek is a huge fan of Eddie Money. 
[01:53:30]  Goes and sees him every time Eddie Money plays locally.  So we brought Derek in to sing along as Eddie Money was doing Take Me Home Tonight.  And what?  I think he's only seen him once.  Oh, really?  That was bullshit?  Everybody was talking about what a huge fan he is.  Did they throw him under the bus?  I think he likes him, but he's like, dude, I've seen him once.  Oh, my God.  Let me see that.  Is that Old Vag?  Let me see.  That is the most ultra close-up I have ever seen of just...  Why do we want that? 
[01:54:00]  No, I'll tell you what's going on there.  That's an old broad.  When your ligaments hang down lower than your pussy lips, there's an issue.  I hate fucking pussies like that.  You hate ligaments?  Yes, I hate ligament box where the vagina just looks like...  That legitimately looks like a bat hanging on a cable.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't even look at that.  Dude, that is so...  Would you like it?  No, no, no.  For the goof?  No, no.  Would you, though? 
[01:54:30]  No.  I would.  Nope.  I'd ball into it.  Yeah, that is just...  I would yodel into it.  All right, you want to hear Derek's isolated track?  So Eddie Money was doing Take Me Home Tonight.  We're like, come on, Derek, sing along.  You love Eddie Money.  You're a huge fan.  And this is how it sounded yesterday.  I'm usually drunk when I do this.  Here we go.  I've got a surprise now, especially for you. 
[01:55:00]  Something that both of us have always wanted to do.  Here we go.  I've waited so long.  I've waited so long.  I've waited so long.  I've waited so long.  I'm going to take you on a trip so far from here. 
[01:55:30]  Yankee Stadium ain't got no money.  I've got two tickets in my pocket, baby.  We're going to disappear.  Because you've waited so long.  I've waited so long.  I've waited so long.  I've waited so long.  I've got two tickets to paradise.  Take it back to me tonight. 
[01:56:00]  Two tickets to paradise.  Two tickets to paradise.  Suck.  Did he get the job a lot?  Oh, my God.  Where did he go?  Oh, is that funny?  There's Derek's isolated track on two tickets to paradise.  Not take me home tonight.  I saw Derek just run down the hallway.  Yeah.  I think he fled the area.  Oh, he went into our office.  He's yelling at somebody.  He is not happy.  Derek is an Eddie Money hack, though. 
[01:56:30]  He didn't even know the fucking second part of the chorus.  No.  Danny, what happened?  What is Derek saying?  Derek actually ran down the hallway to yell at somebody.  He's just like, I saw him headed down the hallway.  I was like, Derek.  Derek.  He's like, no.  No.  Oh, is that great?  And then as I turned around to come back into the studio, as he passed the office, all  I heard was Sam going, two tickets to paradise.  He's rubbing it in.  Wow, that was good. 
[01:57:00]  Let's say hi to God Dank from Philly.  God Dank.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  I want to know if Grandma has to be senile, and is it okay if she wears a hat?  Oh, very good question.  Yeah, she can wear a hat.  Or do I have to bring my own darker gentleman to remove it?  No.  No, she can now wear a hat.  We'll be happy to remove it for her.  Yes.  Thank you.  All right.  Very good.  We definitely want to get an older broad to get naked for us.  We want to set the new record.  The current record is 72. 
[01:57:30]  72 years old.  Yeah.  Naked broad.  Bring her in.  You get $1,000.  I got to take a leak.  You too, Opie.  Does he?  So what do we do?  We were talking about Eddie Money.  Sam went backstage with Eddie Money.  Ooh.  I don't know if the Sam backstage stuff is going to continue.  Why?  Why?  It's kind of competing with the show.  Is it?  Yeah.  It should just be on the show.  Hmm.  I mean, that backstage, that's like giving the listeners a little extra. 
[01:58:00]  I don't know if it's allowed.  Yeah, that's true.  Wow.  I'm going to shut him down, I bet.  It's all so confusing right now.  God damn.  What?  Nothing.  You all right?  Oh, I'm fine.  Oh.  Oh, I'll be just fine.  Oh.  Mountain pose?  Hmm.  No.  Downward dog?  No.  Cup and saucer.  Here's Sam backstage with Eddie Money. 
[01:58:30]  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and rock star Eddie Money recently stopped by the Opie and Anthony  show.  We found him in the hall after his appearance to find out how it went.  Hey, huh?  How about this hair?  Is he smoking or what?  We're with Eddie Money.  What do you know what rock bands look like these days?  You're in a band, aren't you?  No, I'm not in a band.  I work on the radio, though.  Oh, that's right.  No, no.  It's better than being in a band.  So how'd the, uh, how'd the performance?  You do the secretaries instead of the groupies. 
[01:59:00]  What's the difference?  How'd everyone say this is a piece of ass, you know?  That's right.  Eddie Money was high on life.  He apparently has been following the boys for quite a while, as he was familiar with  Opie's old radio station and Ant's old band.  How'd everything go on O&A today?  I thought those guys are great.  Opie's good people from BAB, and Anthony's great.  They're very, you know, I remember Rotgut, I mean, you know, the Long Island boys, man.  We've, you know, it was, you know, I feel like old times back in there.  How good times.  I'm glad they got, I'm glad this show's doing really good.  How come you think Rotgut never made it? 
[01:59:30]  Well, when they're hanging themselves on stage, I don't know.  They were very crazy, and they had some really great songs, but I, you know, I would have  bought their record if they would have put one out.  I thought it was funny shit.  Answering questions legitimately made Eddie very nervous.  So luckily, he went back to those money jokes.  Hanging out with the money man, huh?  Yeah.  Well, this guy goes to the doctor with his wife, and he's a little out of here, and the  doctor says, listen, I'm going to need a stool sample and a urine analysis.  The doctor goes, ah, what?  I'm going to need a stool sample and a urine analysis.  What?  Give me your underwear. 
[02:00:00]  Thanks, Eddie.  Hopefully, you're not off to operate any heavy machinery.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with O&A.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Walk-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Anyone?  La-la-la.  East pounding down, right? 
[02:00:30]  La-la-la.  When Kenny Powers goes into the, uh, the gym for the middle school dance.  also  also  the audio that's being played while that hot chick  rubs the ice all over her body  that's why I thought it sounded familiar  it's a good pickup  you wondered why you're listening to this  and you started ejaculating  Ice Girl was very nice  I saw Primetime Sam Roberts  with a microphone 
[02:01:00]  and a Derek  that was interesting  I can only imagine what the conversation was  because it was right after  Derek's isolated vocal  while he was singing with Eddie Money  was played  well I was hoping you would give me a little of it  and just sing some in the hall  oh very good good call  I bet he just started singing like a bird  no he wouldn't sing so I just  follow him around  you boys used to sing like birds 
[02:01:30]  little Nicky alert  little Nicky  did you get a picture of him?  he's got a chief shirt on  he's let all Nicky  now he's like rocking it  now he acknowledges what he wants by  I guess it got back to him  yikes  so did he get dirt?  Jesus Christ  yeah I mean I didn't  he's making friends everywhere aren't we?  I didn't get him to sing  but that's definitely going to be a part of  an upcoming backstage with ONA  he was so pissed when he found out what you guys did  by isolating the track of him 
[02:02:00]  trying to sing along to the Eddie Money song  he ran down the hall to yell at somebody  and then he tried to play it cool  and just be like  no I'm not embarrassed  I thought it was kind of funny actually  and then I just started pestering him to sing the song  and he started flipping out again  I'm sure he didn't want to sing  no he didn't at all  Derek's a very strange bird man  yeah  we don't really know much about Derek  hey Derek's just your run of the mill  guy that likes to drink  are you the rat?  oh Mars shaking hands with somebody  oh boy 
[02:02:30]  oh is Mars the secret agent?  Mars you broke my heart  we did good today  is that what you're saying Mars?  was that what that handshake was all about right there?  huh?  I don't think it's Mars  no  no Mars is a good egg  you fucking break the equipment trying to record with it  we got a picture of little Nicky  he eluded us  but then there was a camera  waiting for him as he turned the corner  we're such idiots 
[02:03:00]  and it was like the paparazzi  he couldn't get away  so we finally got a picture of little Nicky  I think E-Rock tipped him off  because somebody tipped him off  we can't even  Danic is popping up these huge pictures of little Nicky  and it's just too fucking funny  how much he looks like him  I know another visual bit for the radio show  oh well  oh boy  don't put it on anything you can see  oh there's the thought

[02:05:30]  what?  aren't you the guy that  you want to be on the radio?  no  why would you say that?  because you sound just like him  you're from Philly  okay  I guess  people can't sound  similar to each other  that's Anthony by the way  the guy you like on the show  that's what I said  that's exactly what I said  that people can't sound  similar to each other  well I'm gonna go  I really  I really like the show  I just think  Opie should maybe  go somewhere else  that's it  okay  sir there is no show  without Opie  14 years of the  Opie and Anthony show  and you're predicting 
[02:06:00]  his demise  in the program  even if today  was my  if he left  yeah today  even if it was my last day  I had a hell of a run  you idiot  it would still be a highly  successful run  on a radio program  Jesus people  come on man  unbelievable  alright Greg  you got under my skin  Greg  oh and he hung up  let it be known  he hung up  hey do we have that website  for that chick?  yeah it's called  Jim you might be  on to something  from the start  it kinda looks good 
[02:06:30]  I don't like that  big Borat bathing suit  she's wearing  what am I on to?  she's just dancing  around like a knucklehead  it's not as salacious  as the one yesterday  but it might be  the same chick man  I don't think  it's the same chick  I'm trying to see  if it's the same chick  she's wearing a Borat  bathing suit  only pink  I know it's brutal  it's brutal  but wait till  their boobies come out  wait till what?  wait till them boobies  come out  they look a lot like  Ice Girl  what they're just  big tits  oh that's definitely  the same girl 
[02:07:00]  is the tattoo the same?  oh there she's got  a tattoo  it does look like her  let's see her hips  from the back  we have to close  the curtains now  because we're looking  at a hot chick  that might be naked  that's definitely her  yeah that's her  she's got the same  weird dance move  and the stupid dance  that she's doing  yeah  she's grabbing her hips  I hate that bathing suit  she's grabbing her hips  Jimmy  yeah I know she is  of course she is  she's fucking cutting  something with a buzzsaw  so she's gonna hold her hips  enough of this fucking chick  do you uh  you like her swimsuit?  yeah I do  turn around 
[02:07:30]  let me see  she's very sexy  oh yeah that's the same tattoo  yeah that's the girl  that's her  I thought you didn't like her hips  Jimmy  do you like her hips  in this video?  um they were right  you know whatever  I wouldn't mind  smelling her backside  don't get me wrong  nothing there though  nice ass  I like the dance  in the bikini  we get it  alright here they come  come on  pull that apart  pull that apart  show your daddy  show your pussy  yeah you're just full of  let's say that  you think she's the rat?  yes 
[02:08:00]  I'm sick of that bit  yeah yeah  go fuck yourself Greg  now I've heard  a hundred more times today  does she fucking  ever take the top off  and unleash those hounds?  yeah  you gotta  you gotta fast forward  yeah  yeah no shit  she's just standing there  kind of dancing  oh  oh hello  a little nip  starting to reveal  a little nip  she might be a  one hit wonder there  she's a tease  yeah this one stinks  Jesus Christ  I'm right with you  alright they're unleashed  wow  the boobs look better 
[02:08:30]  in this video  I love when she bends over  and they just kind of  flop forward  and she's working  right there yeah  I think what helps  big boobs  you can't have tan lines  like in the other video  she has tan lines  but they make them  look a little saggier  yeah yeah  these don't look saggy  a little bit of tan line  I love a good tan line  big meaty tits  wow she does have  some biggins  alright  should we turn  everyone on to this  very sexy  yeah let them crash 
[02:09:00]  who cares  and then she's putting  her top back off  oh  why does she go  behind something  to get dressed  the internet  we can't see your badge  what are you modest  she's a dick  dare to dream  same joke  two days in a row  of course  alright enough  with this cornball  Miami shit  done  she doesn't do  anything else  thank you Jim  yeah no worries  should we do this one 
[02:09:30]  and Danny  it's up to you  Danny knows  Danny knows his shit  as far as the porn  on the internet goes  it's alright  I mean I'm sure  somebody's gonna have  fun with it  yeah  I don't even know  how to search for it  because it's this  straight-hipped cocktease  dot com  if you go to dump dot com  and you put in the  search engine  striptease photo shoot  that's how you'll get there  there you go  there's way more videos  I'd rather watch  than that though  yeah  exactly  do you need the  hardcore stuff  you wanna do something  today  no no  you wanna do something 
[02:10:00]  you wanna do something  and Danny clicked  one click  and it was right there  you knew exactly  where to go  I'm just asking  I think sometimes  those type of videos  are way hotter  than just going hardcore  some of them are  yeah  I don't know  I think I'm at the point  now where it's like  it doesn't even matter  what I'm looking at anymore  like I'm numb  like I need to just  I need to quit  porno  yeah  you need to quit looking  for like six months  yeah  can we open up the curtains  now that we're not  looking at nude girls anymore  well I still got some stuff  what the fuck's going on  I still got something  yo  dude we used to have  naked girls 
[02:10:30]  and like  everybody came in  all sorts of suits  yeah yeah  the secretary  would come in  Sam's girls  the secretary  just to look at  a little dumb clip  online  we got to close  these heavy curtains  there was no window  there at any W  well then why are you  putting us here then  I know  you should have put us  you know around the  corners  whatever  but sometimes there  were people that  would actually come  in to watch  you know  the door was  constantly flying open  yeah  we didn't post a guard  that someone couldn't  walk in while  fucking all kinds  of shit was going on  that's why a priest  had to see a couple 
[02:11:00]  fucking of chicks  with dildos once  that was a lovely  scene there  I was trying to do  his charity event  we got battling  dildo chicks  he just came in  to tell us the  latest tote  yeah the latest tote  on the tote board  hey guys we're  raising all  there is no god  my name's Fred  imagine he just  does the caddyshack line  threw his collar off  and we were idiots  because we're like  no come on in  check it out  I know  we had to egg him on  we thought we were  doing something good 
[02:11:30]  by showing him that  and he refuses  to raise money  with us  yeah  so  that makes perfect  sense actually  oh Roland's saying  thank you very much  for the shout out  on the show today  tell Roland to shut up  by the way  I can't  I've been thinking  about Roland  for three days  my new obsession  my favorite new song  is Springsteen's  Youngstown  really  I heard it on  Deep Tracks  on Deep Tracks  fucking Youngstown  it's from 95  it's about  Youngstown Ohio  where they make  all the fucking  metal for the bombs 
[02:12:00]  what working man  crap does he have  it's a good song man  he ran out of  fucking places in Jersey  yep he had to go west  is this uh  what album is this off  the ghost of uh  it is off that one  whatever one yeah  it's a great song  they built a blast  burn  blast burn  they were along  the shore  and they made  cannonballs  that helped  the union  with the war  here in Youngstown 
[02:12:30]  here in Youngstown  he'd just throw  a fucking dart  into a map  and write a song  about a city  yeah  he'd probably  here darling  in Youngstown  Albuquerque  Albuquerque  you know what we  should do  we should throw  like darts  at a map  yeah  so you have to sing  a song about that  like you said  and then like  an occupation  a map  an occupation  then the name 
[02:13:00]  of his wife  or not wife  it's always a girl  his girl  yeah  and would sing  a song  and then you just  kind of do a Bruce  thing  yeah  this is great  though  smoke stacks  actually I like this  am I the only one  that kind of hears  a little bit of  Seeger's turn the page  in this  dude  yes I thought  the same thing  a little bit  yeah a little bit  on the road again  there I am  up on the stage  here I go 
[02:13:30]  it is  yeah  alright let's say  Travis if he doesn't  find the Seeger song  we're gonna bite his beard off  now he just changed it  I have it  I'm just  screaming Travis  it's a microphone  it conveys sound  yeah you should have  gotten another song  you can't ask me  for something  why would you go  from the middle  of that song  to the beginning  of the song  that is always different 
[02:14:00]  get the live version  from Canada  you gotta start  with the vocals  here I go  playing stars  what version is this  why would you get  the original version  oh my god  this sounds like  the polka version  there are two versions  you hear that  one is off an album  called back in 72  get the one that says  sounds like Springsteen  in the fucking parentheses  it's fucking  I don't think Travis  knows music  before 1990  it's Bob  I'll play you  Bob Seeger  and the Silver Bullet Band 
[02:14:30]  yeah  this version  no one has ever heard  yeah well this is  the version that's wrong  exactly  this is off  someone recorded this  illegally  how about get one  Bob Seeger  sanctioned  dot com  I'll play you  the other one  that's fine  yes please do  someone's mini disc recorder  let's go  we're all irritated  fucking spit  right in your face  there it is  that's the one  we all know  there's two  Bob Seeger  turns to the page  I just picked one  we heard you  okay  now like  can we do  Youngstown  at the same time  you chose  poorly  yes  wait a minute 
[02:15:00]  this is different too  I don't think  this is right either  those are your two choices  that's all you have  there's a really big one  that's a live version  that means  you guys are thinking  of Metallica  no this is way different too  it is  this is not the one  we're all used to  there's a live version  on YouTube that's good  but I think that's the one  you're thinking of  it's a little faster  I bet you  the record company  fucked him  and he had to  redo all his music 
[02:15:30]  that happens to bands  all the time  the most famous song  that had to be redone  Amy by the Pure Prairie League  really  go a little deep  that's famous  I've never heard that  well Amy was a huge song  and the guys didn't have  the rights to the song  anymore or something  so they re-recorded it  oh smart  but it doesn't sound like  the one everyone knows  it's the chorus  that's a little slower  no no  see  this isn't it  is this the original  it's not the one 
[02:16:00]  everyone knows  and the vocals  are a little different  alright stop that  I like this  of course you'll like  the other song  it's the same thing  that came out first  Youngstown is a  really good song  we got  Youngstown  oh Youngstown  I'd start like  Pink Cadillac  we got Mike in Youngstown  it's Pank Cadillac  Pank Cadillac  I did buy a bunch 
[02:16:30]  of Springsteens  yes Springsteens  yes it's like  Springsteen  but who cares  about the place  that fucking  they made the cannonballs  oh I like that  with the blast furnaces  we like the blast furnaces  I've wondered  Mike  Jimmy finally turned  me on a song  yeah  I've turned on  a lot of songs  like what else  turned you on  I make believe  on all that other stuff  Disco Duck  Disco  Disco Duck  nothing better  than Saturday Night Fever  when they're  teaching the old people  to do Disco 
[02:17:00]  to Disco Duck  Jimmy turn me on  to a great scene  turn me on  to a song  that has nothing  to do with  Ozzy Black Sabbath  or Kiss  yes exactly  I will  just give me a second  I can't just start  shouting all willy nilly  while you think  who's screaming  Lead Belly's version  of the Nirvana song  yeah  uh Mike  I got you on that one right  wait what  didn't I turn you on  to Lead Belly's version  of Where Did You Sleep  Last Night  the original  I don't know  didn't I turn you on  to Johnny Cash's version 
[02:17:30]  of 13  Johnny Cash  you turned me on  to a lot  you turned me on  to Johnny Cash  in general  because Jimmy  had like a  like a  like a  a mixtape  I was about to say  did Jimmy give you  a mixtape  yes with like  little thoughts  and sentiments  in between  you guys  are going steady  I knew Johnny Cash  was cool  and all that  but Jimmy  used to listen  to a lot  of Johnny Cash  in between gigs  and uh  turned me on  to a lot  of songs  I would have  never found  on my own  by Johnny Cash  hey have you guys  ever been out  to Youngstown Ohio  I have not  no  no  oh don't bother  really 
[02:18:00]  what about  what about  the blast  furnaces  and the cannonballs  that's right  oh all that  shit's gone man  it's too depressing  around here  here in Pittsburgh  it's a little bit  better town  everyone's got  a mullet  my girl  hell I think  Cleveland's a little  bit better than here  alright Mike  we're gonna listen  to some blues  slow down  where did you sleep  last night  yes  fucking Kurt  made this his song  I'm telling ya  I still prefer  Lead Bellies  do you really  yeah 
[02:18:30]  he did this one  he did a faster  version  I like  Eddie Lead  better  I like  my girl  my girl  version better  where will you go  I'm going  yeah Kurt  was starting  a solo career  with that unplugged  shit by the way  you can't say  it was Nirvana  that was Kurt Cobain's  song  yeah  do you like  I love when artists  redo other songs  like I like to hear  different versions  like the hitter 
[02:19:00]  is another  Springsteen song  I fucking love  look at you  it's the fucking  Springsteen fan  it's another one  that's not a huge hit  but it was redone  by Tom Jones  on his album  and then I'm like  cool this is a great song  and then Springsteen's  version I like a lot  too  it's his song  I like  six bombs  six bombs  yeah  did he have teeth  lead belly  probably not  he was probably  really old  when they finally 
[02:19:30]  got him on tape  yeah he was in jail  and he fucking  sang his way  out of jail  he had like  two murders  he had a really  cool story  is that  that's him  yes  Hedy Ledbetter  his name was  in a nice suit  and everything  he was a fucking  criminal  yeah  he was a bad boy  Hedy  yeah look up  his story Dan  and quick  give me the synopsis  what happened  down there  what happened  down there  I can tell you  about it  you dropped something  yeah  yeah he fucking  sang pick a bale 
[02:20:00]  of cotton  he sang  did he  yeah yeah  he sang a bunch  of songs  with his accordion  in that picture  till we open up  the curtains  we're just listening  to lead belly  I don't think  this would kiss  anybody  yeah but the word  belly is kind  of insinuating  sexuality  his picture  might offend  certain people  yes  yeah put a curtain  around Anthony  I think it will be  alright  hang in there  hang in there  I like the curtain  because people  wonder what are they  doing in there  they're mysterious  must be crazy  we should just  open up the curtain  and we're all  just naked 
[02:20:30]  nude  nude  what did you say  jerking off on a cracker  yeah  yeah  that's hot  piss again  yeah you know  I think it's the  first time ever  I will be doing  a mid-show piss  I actually have  to take a leak  at least your kidneys  work well  that's good  I could usually  not take a leak  the whole fucking  show  I could just sit  here  I piss before  I leave in the  morning  and then I piss  after the show

[02:21:30]  I was listening to  the replay  and of the  standing bombing  it is so funny  when you bomb  and then Jimmy  just beating you  into the ground  it's better than  bombing  but the Jimmy part  where he's beating  you into the ground  on it  it's priceless  I was fucking  laughing my ass off  it was great  watching somebody  bomb  when they're so  sure about one  they don't even  get all  they just move  up to the mic  quickly  like I can't  let this moment  pass  yeah please

[02:40:30]  yeah  apparently  uh  white house press  secretary responds  to wanda sykes  rush limbaugh  9  11 joke  well of course  everyone's gonna  make a big  to do  i really kind of  have to say this  you know  i heard rush  barely touched  it yesterday  on the show  everyone was  expecting rush  to be all over  that probably  good move  on his part  so uh  this is what  the white house  press secretary  had to say  what did the  president think  of wanda sykes  comment about  rush limbaugh  and the hijacker  well 
[02:41:00]  what would  what would  be the real  answer to that  question  because i know  this is gonna be  a complete  bullshit  answer  here it is  uh  if you saw  you saw the  president laughing  uh  wanda sykes is  a comedian  um  and she uh  made a joke  and the president  was laughing at  a joke  he enjoyed the joke  he enjoyed the joke  it really simplified  jimmy for real  the honest answer  would be uh  the real honest  answer would be  well the president  hates that fat  cracker  so anybody  shitting on him  is okay  in barack size  there you go 
[02:41:30]  he'd probably say  9-11 jokes  so he doesn't  really go for  them  but in the  context of  this fat  white  fucking  annoyance  i was very  happy  is there any  doubt in your  mind that it's  gonna be completely  different than  what anthony said  absolutely  this is  well um  i'll leave it to  the immediate  past president  of the white  house correspondence  association to  discuss  no no i  understand let  me let me  give you my  full answer if  you'll give me  one second to  do it  i don't know  how guests get  booked um  that's a white 
[02:42:00]  house correspondence  association uh  thing  i'll pass the  buck  i think the  president i haven't  talked specifically  with him but my  guess is jeff that  uh i think there  are a lot of  topics that are  better left  um for serious  reflection rather  than comedy  uh i think there's  no doubt that  uh 9-11 is part  of that  and this is why i  hate the system  in general  first he passed  the buck  bullshit  twice  bullshit  and then he goes  into a thing  about you know 
[02:42:30]  well there's no  place for humor  there in any  way shape or  form he  didn't kill her  though he  didn't he  didn't shit  on her he  gave as as  almost like as  non-trashing her  an answer  politician answer  it was a  politician answer  you can't trash  her but he  can't make it  seem like  obama was uh  you know  laughing his  ass off at  a 9-11 joke  he could have  said that the  president was  totally shocked  by it or  whatever or  was shocked  but then but  but you can't  because he was  laughing  that's true  the whole place  was fucking 
[02:43:00]  laughing  it'd be funny  if you said  we're seriously  investigating her  allegations we  feel they have  merit  yes uh we're  looking into it  um is she in  trouble for uh  doing that  no way  because the  golf analyst is  in trouble right  well that's because  i think cbs as a  corporation probably  came down on him  i don't think that  was from outside  pressure  any more  trouble  huh  farity at the uh  whatever his name  is yeah  that's probably cbs  that's probably them  or him just  cutting it off  that's probably him  going look they're  gonna fuck me here  let me just apologize 
[02:43:30]  and move on  it might have just  been his call  imus was kind of  brave today about  the whole thing  could you pass me  the daily news  jimmy i just  remembered something  i don't have my  daily news in front  of me  and could you pass  this one to  throw it to  sweetie  yes  that's what a  team leader  pass that to  me thank you  there you go  what's on tv  today  oh  my show is  premiering  what  what  okay  fuck it  what's next  i just wanted to

[02:46:30]  by the way  everyone says  oxycontin  you gotta pronounce  the word  conton  oxycontin  i say content  yes  oxycontin  look how you're  reading along  like this is like  i know  this is good  it's cool right  yeah  but i miss express  dismay  that  was not  hold on  oh you're making  it difficult  oh i'm sorry  literal jim  i was showing off  my new reading  skills  you're reading  chops  but  i'll let you go  no now you're not  going to let me go 
[02:47:00]  i will  hurry i want to know  i don't want to read  ahead  but i'm  oh wow  he's really gonna  let me go  but i miss  expressed  johan santana  walks off the  mound  the immaturity  in this room  it's fucking  just childish  nonsense  horrible  but i miss  expressed  hey is it  true family guy  was making fun  of uh 
[02:47:30]  uh uh  uh what's the  cartoon you always  make fun of  somebody  marmaduke  yes  i'm telling you man  there's writers  at this point  i'm all in  i'm all in  with the conspiracy  theory that  there are writers  that work for family  guy that listen  to this fucking  radio show  it was it was  very brief  i mean i think  they did it a  little more in  depth in the  past when they  did the uh  the bc  comic because  i don't know  jim used to  jim used to  do those  but uh  yeah they did  kind of touch  mind 
[02:48:00]  i was like  yeah whatever  i think it's  just kind of  like one of  those coincidences  but now i'm  all in  i think  there's a writer  on family guy  that likes  this show  they've been  discussing this  uh behind the  scenes the like  the you know  on a fans  for a while  and i was like  i don't know  come on  although the  tyson spelling bee  was very suspicious  back back  but now they  made fun of the  marmaduke uh  comic strip  that's uh  benchmark  it was funny  the way you  just said it  to you like  the marmaduke 
[02:48:30]  it was like  a real mob  way of saying  it  marmaduke  marmaduke  yeah  are you the  right  marmaduke of the  year  are you the  right  see now i do  it with no one  going by the  window  that's the  brilliance of the  bit  uh but i  must express  dismay  anthony that  sykes was not  criticized by  some of those  who condemn  cbs's david  faraday  for his joke  about shooting  nancy pelosi  and then imus  said and god  bless imus for  saying this  the only reason  sykes got away  with without  an avalanche of  criticism said 
[02:49:00]  imus is because  she's a black  woman  yeah well  and making fun  of a conservative  it is easier to  get away with  things um  uh as far as  comedy goes  so let's come in  here in black  face um  i don't think  we could do  that why  that happened  um a few  times and people  have gotten in a  lot of trouble  for it apparently  danny remember  what you said  about my food  yesterday it's  it's never made  the air so you  want to attempt  it i know i'm  putting you on  the spot but i'm 
[02:49:30]  it was really  funny uh yeah  yesterday what's  wrong with this  food looks like  petting zoo food  now everyone  thinks jimmy's  brilliant instead  of you  let's replay  my star trek  line again  that was i  will give  credit where  it is due  wow that  is um  an observation  i made  yesterday  after danny 
[02:50:00]  said it out  loud i  noted it  mentally  that was  danny's joke  and i stole  it out from  under him  danny's  going like  sitting up  like ah  let me tell  you  that felt  good  boom jimmy's  that felt  good  chris wisconsin  uh yeah i  got a rerun i  think it was a  rerun a family  guy last night  hey are you a  cheese head  what  that's right  did you like 
[02:50:30]  that you did  that to me  what  i did a  no but did  you like that  you did the  cheese head  line i'm just  asking i'm not  stealing a  cheese head  i felt kind of  good  give yourself  a bill  uh yes chris  um they did  two girls one  cup and they  recorded his  uh stewie's  reaction like  you guys did  with bob  well see that's  where if we're  gonna keep this  family guy thing  fair uh people  have been like  recording reaction 
[02:51:00]  videos to the  two girls one  cup phenomenon  so you know  what i mean  so that one  you can't really  say they got  from us  it totally  reminded me of  the show last  night though i  was like they  got it from you  guys but oh  well yeah all  right uh i mean  they made fun of  joaquin phoenix  recently uh oh  keith overman rich  ona fan chicago  you've got he  writes in big  letters to hear  keith overman's  reaction to the  wanda thing uh  i guess he was  quoted as saying  keith that is she

[02:58:30]  i told him to stop  he didn't stop  i hit him back  and then he got  really angry  he's going to  bludgeon her acting teacher  beat her  you ever tell her  she's good again  you're dead  oh people are saying  i gotta adjust stuff  hmm where do i start  it's okay  let's see what this does  no  don't push that 
[02:59:00]  huh  those little buttons  on the side  there's so many of them  thread over  he gave up  he walked away  good  oh he did  where'd he go  we're being held hostage  did he go left or right  just behind another curtain  lurking  yeah  open up that curtain  he's lurking  he's a peeker  peeking around a corner  he's a urinal peeker  he's a glancer  he was out there  for 20 minutes  he gave up  oh  maybe it's safe  to go to break  yeah i'm gonna follow  that girl down the hallway  that bitch is swishing  some hips 
[02:59:30]  ah yes we have to now  oh soup  alright  thank you kenny  you're welcome  yay  of course  the more official language  as reported by the  saudi english language  newspaper arab news  quoted judge  hamad al-razin  as saying  if a person  gives 1200 rials  about 320 dollars  to his wife  and she spends  900 rials  about 240 dollars  to purchase an abaya  from a brand shop  and if her husband  alright  that's why  we'll never  be one in the world 
[03:00:00]  what did she buy  an abaya  from a brain shop  and that goes  without saying  then you could  absolutely belt  it right in the face  wait  an abaya  from a brain  a brain shop  as in in your head  no brain  a brain  yeah i'm pretty sure  it was the brain shop  and she spends  900 rials  about 240 dollars  to purchase an abaya  from a brand shop  a brand brand shop  an abaya  an abaya  from a brand shop 
[03:00:30]  jimmy  you're an expert  on the middle east  what is she buying  um a horse  an abaya  is a brand of horse  and a brand shop  is um  where uh  a brand is sold  a brand shop  they're delicious  i'm glad it wasn't  a store where improv  maybe i could have  found that first  why  it's wonderful  that was really good  just steak nothing  an abaya 
[03:01:00]  abaya or  abaya from  brand shop  a brand  or a brand  i think there's an h  in that word  B-R-A-N-A.  Well, God knows how it's spelled.  X-L-P-1.  Squiggly.  Squiggly line.  It's a letter, Jimmy.  I made that up.  A squiggly, a picture of a horse.  It's funny, right?  Yes, it is.  Give yourself a ringy dingy.  All right.  I was in the middle of my great caveman joke.  Oh, no.  It's okay. 
[03:01:30]  I actually didn't hear it.  It's all right.  Just imagine because he said, how do you spell that?  And then, you know, of course, you've got to go with the most outrageous way people spell things, which would be pictures of stuff.  Oh, hieroglyphics.  See how I got around that without telling the joke, huh?  Give yourself a tinkle.  Ooh, all right.  No, not that kind.  About $240 to purchase an abaya from a brand shop.  And if her husband slaps her on the face as a reaction to her action, she deserves that punishment. 
[03:02:00]  The abaya is the black cover that women in Saudi Arabia are required to wear.  According to the paper, women in the audience made it clear that they took issue with that.  But it didn't seem to get any better.  According to Arab News, the judge also said that women shared as much responsibility for their abuse as men did.  And then said that women's indecent behavior and use of offensive words against their husbands were some of the reasons for domestic violence in the country.  Yeah, let's go over there and try to get along.  Yeah, yeah, and we treat them like gold. 
[03:02:30]  We can't even, like, agree on the basics that maybe women should be treated nice.  Those Saudis are our allies, and we make like they're fucking civilized and think like us.  And meanwhile, it's just there are atrocities going on over there.  But we need that go-go juice.  Dude, we completely run this place.  Yeah.  Every suit walking by now has no tie-on. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Because they don't want to be the idiot that has the tie-on.  Maybe it's a joke on us.  No, because they know all, like, the rock dudes and everybody that really runs this place are all like, good one.  There's no way.  Good one is.  No one has a tie-on today.  Is it come to work without the tie-day day?  Tie-day day.  You know, those silly corporate things that make it feel like you're more comfortable.  Friday is Hawaiian shirt day, so feel free to wear your Hawaiian shirt on Friday. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Ah, what?  What?  Look at the graphic of that buffalo plane.  I caught it all playing.  Oh, we're going to talk about that.  Oh, do they show how it went?  It ain't good.  Let me get the second clip on, and then let's move on to that, and then let's get Woo Kid in here.  Okay, I'm going to go pee real quick while you do that.  Okay.  I have to pee a lot.  Yeah, what's wrong, Jimmy?  I pee a lot every day.  You're peeing more.  No, I just pee a lot.  Mm-hmm.  I'm eating my soupy.  Are you going to talk to someone, maybe? 
[03:04:00]  Is this your excuse to leave us?  No.  Mm-hmm.  What do you think, Ed?  No, I think it's just got piss.  That's all it is.  Really?  Yeah.  You're not paranoid like I am?  No.  Mm-hmm.  That chicken noodle soup smells good.  Do you want to try it?  I want it right now.  Saudi women's rights activist Wajija al-Hawader told CNN that Saudi women routinely face such attitudes.  This is how men in Saudi Arabia see women, she said in a telephone interview from the Saudi city of Dahrani. 
[03:04:30]  She added that,  I'm not surprised to see a judge or a religious man saying that.  They've been raised in the same culture, a culture that tells them it's okay to raise your hand to a woman, that this works.  Human Rights Watch, which has long campaigned for increased women's rights in Saudi Arabia, added that it was extremely troubling that a judge...  I'm bored with this clip.  Extremely troubling.  I don't even know.  I lost...  Lost interest in that little discussion?  For the people that pay attention, I'm really sorry.  A conversation. 
[03:05:00]  Hey, I got an idea.  You got the soup, right?  I do.  There's a soup waiting to talk to us, but if I leave, then you could just say, look, why don't you wait till Ope gets back?  Then he can't talk to you.  This is true.  And then we're good for a while.  And then we're good for a little while.  Yeah, go to break.  Hold on.  Wait for me to get outside the studio.  All right.  And then you eat your soupy.  I'll make believe I got shit to do.  Who's going to...  And I'll come back just in time.  Just in time for the live show.  But who's pressing the button?  I don't know.  Just leave the mics on.  Okay. 
[03:05:30]  Ready?  Hold on.  Wait till I'm at the door.  Okay.  I'll wait.  Ope's going toward the door.  Toward the door.  Toward the...  All right.  Opening it.  And...  I'm going to leave quietly.  Okay, go ahead.  He can't slam that door.  He can't slam that door.  You can't slam that door.  It's got like a pneumatic thing on it.  All right.  There he goes.  I got to go to break.  I got to eat.  All right.  We'll be right back.  It's the Ope and Anthony show. 
[03:06:00]  We're going to get Woo Kid in a second here.  He's walking down the hall with primetime Sam Roberts.  The Woo Kid has taken a liking to Sam.  To Sam.  Who hasn't?  And he's on Shade 45, which is Sirius 45, XM 66.  There's something he can work on, too.  If it's Shade 45, maybe it should be 45 on both satellite radio companies.  He's got a camera and everything.  What's that?  Does management know?  Uh-oh.  Better know about that. 
[03:06:30]  Sam wants to introduce his new friend to everybody.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the studio, Woo Kid.  Oh, Woo.  I'm saying Woo.  Thank you.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Hanging.  Jesus Christ.  We were a little cranky today.  I see, man.  A little cranky with the fucking organization today.  You've got to know how it is.  I hear a lot of Johnny Cash going on up here, man.  Yeah.  What's going on, man?  Y'all playing the Snoop Dogg version?  What did he do? 
[03:07:00]  You know there's a Snoop Dogg remix with Johnny Cash?  You didn't hear that?  No way.  Did they mix it together or did they just redo a song?  I think they remixed it.  What song?  I mean, the hip-hop community rallied against it.  Really?  Oh, really?  But it's out.  It should be on.  What song?  Because you don't know Johnny Cash, see?  I don't know Johnny Cash.  Does Snoop have any credibility left at all?  Be honest.  Does he have any fucking credibility left?  As far as drugs go, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, smoking weed, yeah. 
[03:07:30]  But I mean, I don't think as far as hip-hop goes, as far as any street cred goes, he's  done too much shit.  Now, being on a commercial is okay, but he's just done too much crappy commercial shit and  stuff.  Were you like, oh, Snoop.  I mean, he does Bollywood.  He has a country record on his album, Buy My Medicine.  A country record?  Come on, he can't go wrong.  He's just trying to combine with the masses.  He can't do anything wrong.  Is that what it's called?  Combining with the masses? 
[03:08:00]  I mean, you know, I don't know.  This guy can do anything now.  I went to India and he's doing Bollywood.  Bollywood.  I don't think combining with the masses is how they phrase it on Shade 45.  I don't know.  It doesn't really work well on Eminem, but I'm hearing a lot of Johnny Cash today, man.  Well, I want to hear the Snoop Dogg thing.  Travis, you got it?  Oh, my God.  I think what it was is that he remixed an entire album of Johnny Cash songs.  All right, dude.  Yeah, that's what I'm reading online, at least.  Well, you don't know, though.  I want a little taste.  You don't get a taste. 
[03:08:30]  Well, I don't really blast that in my car every day.  It's kind of weird when you blast country music with rims.  It doesn't really mix right in the hood.  I was always surprised.  Black people I would know, like Phil Collins.  What is a white artist that you like, or an artist that other people in hip-hop would  be surprised that you like?  Like a secret.  I mean, I guess Justin Timberlake is accepted.  Obviously. 
[03:09:00]  No, he's accepted.  That's not a stretch.  Someone you would never tell that you like.  Secretly, I liked Inexcess for all these years.  Really?  I'm a weirdo.  That was pretty good.  A little Suicide Blonde.  Yeah, you know.  Bam, bam, bam.  Yeah, that shit was good.  You know what I'm saying?  But, you know, I mean, when I grew up, there was no hip-hop.  So, I had no choice but to listen to white music.  Yeah, rock.  Well, you've got to explain to everyone who you are, by the way.  Well, I'm DJ Who Kid.  I work for Eminem on Shade 45 on Saturdays. 
[03:09:30]  You know Eminem well?  Yeah, I know him very well.  Bring him in here.  Bring him up here.  Bring him in here.  Let's call him.  You want to call him?  What is it?  He's somewhere in Europe having an orgy, but I think we could call him.  Is he in Europe right now?  I think he's somewhere, like, overseas.  Like, promoting now.  It must be nice.  It must be nice.  It's in Kazakhstan or something.  I know he doesn't love New York.  He comes here when he has to to promote, but he's not a huge fan of New York.  He's usually in and out.  Yeah.  So, you don't really, like, see him.  You see, he's wearing a mask now.  I don't know.  He has, like, a wrestling mask.  I saw that, yeah. 
[03:10:00]  Very creative.  I like Michael Jackson with a little surgical mask and children.  That's one of his friends.  Do you go, what are you doing?  Do you ever go, what are you doing?  He's very, like, cool and down to earth, and usually he wows out when his album comes  out.  Because if Jimmy came in with a mask, we'd be all over that.  We'd be fucking grateful.  Your SARS mask.  What's the last album he put out?  When was that?  Was it, like, six years ago?  It's got a long time, yeah.  The last one he put out was a mixtape, which they didn't do. 
[03:10:30]  They did minimal promo, but it still sold, like, two million or something like that.  Jesus Christ.  Now they're doing promos, so he's probably going to do, like, ten million over again.  No shit.  And all the hip-hop artists now are so horrible.  So he's, like, the Elvis Presley of, like, the black people, so.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys took golf.  We'll take rap.  That's how it works.  But, you know, we need him back, man.  We need the great white hope, man.  We need the return of the, you know, the craziness, the lyrics, the drugs.  I got to ask a dumb question.  How did he ever get accepted in the black community? 
[03:11:00]  Because that's a tough nut to crack.  I know.  Like, you know, that's one thing I've never asked him, but I guess it's just his natural,  like, you know, talent.  Like, you know, the freestyles, the battling, you know, the drugs.  I mean, black people use drugs, too, so.  Didn't you watch his movie?  Come on.  I didn't watch his movie.  What's the matter with you?  I guess that movie, yeah.  You know what?  You're right.  That movie actually crossed him over big time.  Because it's a big drop-off from Eminem, and then I would put in second place Vanilla Ice in  my dumb world.  Wow.  There's probably other guys.  I don't know, though.  Who's, like, the second most popular white rap artist? 
[03:11:30]  How about the Beastie Boys?  Yeah.  Paul Wall.  Paul Wall.  Look at fucking...  Sam knows everything.  Eminem does well because he's not pretending to be something he's not.  That's just the guy he is, and that's where he grew up, so it just seems like if you're  not phony and pretending to be something, then people kind of just kind of can feel it.  But one of the main reasons is he fucked Mariah Carey, so, I mean, god damn.  Yeah.  That gives him some credit.  Yeah, that's hot right there.  Like, no condom, too?  Wow.  Did he bang her with no bag? 
[03:12:00]  What?  You gotta respect that.  He told you this?  What's the bag?  He peed on her and everything.  He was the first R. Kelly, like, situation.  Wow.  Is he rapping about that now?  Yeah, he is.  There's some kind of controversy over that.  He's actually against Nick Cannon.  I don't see Nick Cannon really going back at him because he's, like, the weirdo of,  like, the hip-hop community because he just married this girl for nothing.  That's true, right?  For money, I guess.  I don't know.  He's, like, the reverse, like, gold digger or something.  I don't know.  That's what they call him now, so.  Did he really pee on her?  Yeah, he peed on her.  Do you think Nick knew that before the wedding? 
[03:12:30]  That's something she tells you in the limo on the way to the reception.  I don't like that very much.  But, yeah, but Eminem is, like, a very unique individual.  So, I'm glad I worked for him.  He's my boss.  And, of course, my other boss came here at 50 Cent with the World of Beef.  We loved him.  He was great, man.  He was awesome.  Yeah, he came on the show.  Did he come here with the rat beef and all that stuff?  Yeah.  He talked about it, yeah.  Yeah, with the Rick Ross.  With the police officer that he had problems with?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The corrections officer.  He was throwing him under a bus. 
[03:13:00]  It was fucking great, man.  Get out of here.  You allowed him to ravage the cop on air?  I thought it was funny as shit.  The guy was great.  He's fucking, he's a smart guy.  He's funny as, you know.  And then Sam went on your show with clips of his exclusive interview with Rick Ross.  Classic, yo.  It was good, right?  But Sam Roberts, me, him, had to leave at, like, a back exit.  Because, you know, in hip-hop, they shoot at us, you know, when we do stuff like that.  Who's shooting Sam, though?  They would absolutely think an innocent bystander got hit.  I think he's a tranny with no makeup. 
[03:13:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah, but if you think what 50 was saying on our show was bad, who could spend, like,  maybe five hours on Saturday afternoon just doing an entire show with different people  calling in, dedicated to smashing Rick Ross.  Wow.  It was the rip, uh, the, uh, was it the ripped asshole of Rick Ross weekend?  It was really crazy, like, artists, his baby mother called.  You know, we call them baby moms.  Baby mom, yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, you know, the sperm donor, she called.  Max, you did an interview her today.  Hey, also, aren't you interviewing her?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to get it to you for us, this baby mom.  Oh, you are?  How about you keep us out of this, Sam?  Jesus.  I'm just trying to...  That's all we need.  I'm trying to get you involved.  You've never had fear in your life?  It's already bad enough that we broadcast across the street from Shade 4.  Across the street.  You know what, you know how that goes.  We're sleeping in here innocently and we get a bullet to the head.  We're the dumb, innocent bystanders who will poke our heads out the window.  Who's yelling?  We're the kid in the crib, you know. 
[03:14:30]  We've all read the stories.  You got bulletproof glass like we do, right?  Well, bulletproof glass.  That would be good.  That would be good.  Wait till the Who Kid on Opie and Anthony talks about Eminem and Mariah Carey YouTube video.  Great.  You know something?  I want to show them my video and see if I look tough enough, if I look badass enough.  Yeah, we have to find that, but...  Look at Danny.  Speaking of videos, Sam brags that a video that's doing very well in the hip-hop community  has something to do with us. 
[03:15:00]  I'm like, will you keep us out of this shit?  We don't need this.  What?  There's nothing wrong with that.  I mean, come on.  This guy's licking Rihanna's ass on the internet.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Hey, fuck it.  That was a nice ass.  You got to, right?  You got to give her that.  That was a nice ass.  Before Danny pops up the video, what's the video I'm talking about, Sam?  Well, it's on YouTube.  It's made up of still pictures.  It's not like a video video, but it's audio from Who Kid's show when he had Tony Yayo calling in.  Yeah, and I actually played the clip from this show, and he just went berserk and spazzed out. 
[03:15:30]  I mean, you guys are involved now.  Oh, great.  Now we're involved, man.  Don't worry.  Awesome.  Who Kid said, this clip is from my boys at the Opie and Anthony show.  You guys are okay.  You're under.  All right.  So you guys.  Jesus.  Get the eagle, yo.  What the fuck?  That's the fucking one.  I actually brought you out some classic beef, too.  Like some real Hollywood beef for you guys.  I want your professional opinion.  Go ahead.  As a young African male. 
[03:16:00]  Okay.  How I handle a gun.  Shoot and run.  Shoot and run.  Here it is.  And I'm told I look crazy.  No way.  Look at that psychotic fucking face.  It's very real.  Oh, shit.  That's Desert Eagle, yo.  Jesus.  50 cal.  Yikes.  That thing would kick your ass.  You shoot like a rapper.  You shoot like a marching member.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[03:16:30]  You been to Iraq?  Maybe.  But I'd love to.  You live in Brooklyn?  You ever lived in Brooklyn?  I used to live in Brooklyn.  Oh.  No way.  It's obvious, right?  Jesus Christ.  See, I know I hold the gun up too straight.  I should tilt that fucker a little more sideways.  You know why you need to have like a Rick Ross like poster while he's shooting?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  That would be hot.  I don't think the people at the range would enjoy a white guy shooting at a target of a  black guy down at the pistol range.  That might turn a few heads. 
[03:17:00]  Once again, how about you leave us out?  That's my part of this shit today.  Here's a different one.  This is a 45.  Oh, my God.  A different gun?  This is a basic 45.  This looks very familiar in the G&A camp.  Shoot that one fast.  Wow.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Buck, buck, yo.  No one's getting away from me.  Jesus.  I've seen that too.  That's a G&A classic one right there.  Okay.  All right.  That does look creepy.  You look like you just ate somebody. 
[03:17:30]  Right?  Great look, right?  Right after he fired the gun.  Jimmy was giving me so much shit about how I look like a psychopath.  Yeah.  It's like you're not having fun.  This is fun for me.  I look like I'm having a pisser, don't I?  You look like you have stuff buried in your backyard.  Like baby feet or something, man.  I don't know about this guy, man.  This guy looks scary right there, man.  If you opened your mouth right there, you'd have that spittle connecting your lips.  That psychopath spittle.  You're really scaring me right now.  Nah, nah. 
[03:18:00]  That's just at the range.  You got nerve to be scared of our show.  You guys got like desert eagles.  Well, see, we're keeping them close.  That's why I show the video.  So it's like, all right, I know that motherfucker's crazy.  Well, I know you guys like, you know, you love Tony Danza.  I've seen a lot of your skits.  I brought like actual Tony Danza beef up here.  Like he came on my show.  Tony Danza has a beef with somebody?  How are you getting a beef with Tony?  Well, actually, Tony Danza, in Crash, Tony Danza played like a real motherfucker in that one.  No, but I had him had beef with, um, what the word? 
[03:18:30]  Charles and Charles.  Yeah, from, like, it's a real, like, Hollywood, like, on-air beef.  Battle going on there?  What?  You know, it's hilarious, you know.  I actually brought that out of respect for you guys.  What's the fight?  Well, you'll find out he's got, he's got a curse here.  Damn, I want to hear this.  That's from New Kids show on Shade 45.  Yeah, you can't.  Danza versus Scott Bale.  Yeah, it's hilarious.  Scott Bale could go to hell.  No, I'll leave Scott Bale.  You never had beef with that guy?  I know when he was, I know when he was, I know when he was a little kid. 
[03:19:00]  How are you going to have who's the boss and he comes up with Charles and Charles?  Hey, listen, it wasn't him.  Some people said, hey, we can make a, we can make a dollar here.  Is that Italian, like, beef?  No, you don't care about this?  I get pissed on people saying, hey, Charles and Charles and shit.  Don't be saying Charles and Charles to me.  Yeah, you get mad, right?  I do.  I know it.  You are an instigator.  That's nothing.  I got the reply from Scott Bale.  Oh, awesome.  Let's hear this.  Scott, before you get out of here, you know, there's one thing. 
[03:19:30]  We had Tony Danza on the show a couple weeks ago.  And I don't know, he was going kind of like at you, man.  No, you made him go at him, you ass.  Holy shit, man.  You think I didn't start a new radio?  You fuck.  Wow.  You stir the shit, man.  Yipes.  All right.  He played that perfectly, Todd.  I don't know what his problem is.  What the fuck?  I mentioned your name.  He goes nuts.  I don't know if I should bring this up.  Ratings, ratings, guys.  Come on, man.  Well played, sir.  By the way, what is Scott Bale going to do against Tony Danza? 
[03:20:00]  He would suck his dick while Danza punches him in the face?  He was a boxer.  Yeah, who wants to mess with Danza?  I like at you, man.  He was like, yo, I'm who's the boss.  You know, I was the man back then.  And he was talking a lot of stuff about you, man.  What do you think about that?  You know what's really funny about Tony?  There are so many times back, whenever the hell we were both on, I would look at the  television.  I think he was me.  I swear to God, because if you look quick enough, we're the same guy. 
[03:20:30]  Me, him, and Ralph Macho at one point were the same human beings.  The only thing that separated us was the name.  Yo, I'm telling you, man.  The inclusion of gunfire can make the most...  Yeah, I like the inclusion of gunfire, though.  You gotta add that as flair.  Yeah, it's a little flair.  We should get that clip of you firing on our machine.  Oh, yeah.  We're stealing that one.  Pop, pop, pop.  We're stealing that shit.  The real deal, yeah. 
[03:21:00]  I mean, you don't even...  He makes a good point, though.  They were the same guy.  Yeah.  Completely interchangeable.  And do you get scared, though?  I mean, let's be honest.  Rappers, you know, rap wars get fucking nasty.  A lot, you know, comedians.  Do they, Jim?  No, I read something one time.  Fucking...  I mean, you know, that's gotta be nerve-wracking for me.  I mean, you know, the Biggie and Tupac era where everybody's dying?  I doubt it's like that anymore.  Oh, really?  Everybody's more into making their money, selling their albums, and they're not really  gonna, like, look at, you know, chase each other and shoot each other. 
[03:21:30]  Like, Biggie and Tupac were fucking each other wives, so...  I think there was a lot more...  Really?  I know nothing about this.  I think there were a lot more actual gangsters getting into rap back then, like, at the beginning.  These guys were fucking drug dealers from the street, fucking got into the business, but  never got that out of their system.  It's not like, you know, like Jay-Z.  He used to sell, like, five nickel bags in it.  Yeah, yeah.  Who killed Biggie?  Uh, shit.  If I said that, we would all be dead right now.  I'm just testing to see how brave he really is. 
[03:22:00]  All right, guys.  I ain't that brave.  Tony Danza Freestyle.  What's this about?  Oh, yeah.  That's a classic for you guys.  You know, another Tony Danza extra right there for you.  You know, I'm also a little bit of a rapper myself.  Oh, you can do a freestyle before we get to the contender?  Well, I can't really do freestyle, you know.  Come on, Tony.  Well, like, you know, I wrote a couple...  Like, you know, I used to do this thing in my act, but...  You heard of Italian...  I mean, Vanilla Ice?  Yeah, of course, man.  I'm Italian Ice.  Boom.  Yeah, it was both. 
[03:22:30]  You know, it was stupid.  Stupid, you know.  But I was into, you know, I was really into Heavy D.  Get out of here.  I was, you know.  Like, what is a friend for?  To rich and true poor.  Kind of like a marriage by the way it was before.  A friend could tell you things that he wouldn't tell another.  So, in essence, a friend could be considered a brother.  You laugh and you play a lot.  You talk and you say a lot.  But when it's time to feel the pain, you cry and you pray a lot.  I'm talking about you.  But you who had the time.  The time to be my friend when no one else would be mine.  Tony, that's an exclusive.  Jesus Christ, that's a hit record right there, man.  You're going to get J.C. and everybody. 
[03:23:00]  That's not what I was going to say.  Beyonce's going to get to tell you.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  What a fucking old man Danza is.  I think you were being sarcastic.  You were sitting here dancing while you were playing.  I thought it was hot.  You don't think he has a potential, like, you know.  I mean, Soulja Boy got a record out.  Why Tony Danza?  Italian ice.  Wow.  It's only fair.  You brought Tony Danza's.  And now we do something nice for you.  Oh, shit.  Show him Tony Danza's cock, will you?  Yipes. 
[03:23:30]  It better be a bird.  Did you see Tony Danza's cock?  No.  And I don't know if I'm going to get caught up there.  Well, it turned out he went on his TV show, a little backstory.  Show him Tony Danza's bird.  And he was in a Spider-Man outfit for Halloween or something.  Come on, man.  And he was fucking packing.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, they didn't even cover it up or anything.  What are you talking about?  He's on his show.  And then he came back from commercial.  What do you think, Derek?  What do you think?  I don't know.  Okay, what do you think?  He's sporting a snuffleupagus.  That's a little Kanye-ish for me right now. 
[03:24:00]  Is that respectable in the black community right there, you think?  It's like 808 heartbreak right here.  Is that respectability in the black community?  That doesn't really work well.  Maybe in a Kanye camp, but...  Yeah, not here.  He's a fucking big mule, Danza.  Definitely not here.  Can you move that penis for me?  Yeah, maybe.  The best part of...  Cleanse the palate here.  I want to see the big dick that Ellen stuck in his ass when she took his show.  Jesus Christ, man. 
[03:24:30]  Tony Danza?  The best part of Danza with the Spider-Man thing, he was sporting this ridiculous thing  that coming back from commercial, he was embarrassed that we were trying to cover up.  I remember that.  Yeah, he took his mask off, and he was holding it in front of his dick.  I think he saw the looks coming back at him from the audience.  No way.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  He never shot at you guys?  Like, you know, like...  Oh, yeah.  Because he kind of did a lot of wild skits on that guy for over the years.  We've done some great Tony Danza.  I just wish his show would have went longer.  We were having a field day with that. 
[03:25:00]  Those groups actually thought it was Tony Danza on the phone.  No way.  And, yeah, we used to call up his Tony Danza.  We'd send people out to the line that was waiting to get into his show and say, hey,  I'm a producer from the show.  We'd get one of our interns.  And Tony wants to talk to you.  No way.  I'd get on and start going, hey, it's Tony Danza.  How you doing?  You might remember me from Taxi.  So what do you like about me?  What do you like about Tony Danza? 
[03:25:30]  And they'd be talking like it was really him.  They would freak out.  And I'd slowly get into, how would you like to come backstage and loosen up, Tony, before  the show?  And then we'd get into, like, you know, suck Tony's cars.  And these women, they didn't want to, like, get upset.  They thought it was him.  And they were like, oh, Tony.  And he's like, Midwestern fucking rubes were hanging on during just anus shit.  I liked my asshole, Tony.  You just ruined their whole, like, groupism. 
[03:26:00]  They'd walk in there and just kind of look.  And if Tony looked at them, imagine, they'd be like, well, just on the phone with that  sick motherfucker.  So you guys were, like, his, like, temporary nightmare back in the days.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They knew.  They started putting people on the line to make sure none of our guys were there.  With the cell phones, man.  It was hysterical.  It was amazing.  A lot of fun.  And then the fucking show had to be canceled.  Yeah.  He had to suck.  He had to suck so bad.  His monologues were the worst.  No, no way. 
[03:26:30]  He'd be like, I went to Lincoln Center last night and saw a violin player that was fantastic.  Probably the best violin player I ever saw.  Thoughts and prayers to the 200,000 killed in a tsunami.  It was like, here was one of his segues.  What the fuck, Tony?  You can't go.  It's violinist to fucking.  Come on.  You got to go over a bridge first before you get to that other joke.  It was random like that?  Yeah, yeah.  That was his show.  He had no clue. 
[03:27:00]  We got Shane from Philly.  Shane.  That's Shane from Tennessee, actually.  Tennessee.  I was going to say, Anthony, you asked him to tell you how much of a man you look like  shooting that 50 cal.  You forgot to ask him to look at your boo-boos, too.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that 50 cal.  The trigger finger.  I will tear your fucking trigger finger up.  And I forgot my shooting gloves.  Is that why you got.  Peeled that shit back.  Is that why the band-aid is there for you or fingering somebody?  Yeah.  Fingering some fucking. 
[03:27:30]  It's bleeding through the band-aid.  Some predator-mouthed pussy chick.  They got that boar flu out there.  Watch it.  Don't fuck with that.  Boar flu.  That's even better.  I think Danza had that every day on his show.  We have Who Kid from Shade 45 in studio now.  It says here you met Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  Got to ask about that.  You know, I mean, he's a very cool guy.  And then I was the only one who experienced him cursing.  Like, he actually cursed. 
[03:28:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  How old were you when you met him?  No, I wasn't a child then.  Oh, okay.  Because I wouldn't be here.  I'd be in a mental institution as well.  You remembered me in therapy.  He actually asked me if I had children.  I was like, no.  And I do have two sons.  You got a lot of Michael Jackson, man.  No, no.  They're midgets.  They're midgets.  I don't want my kids meeting your, like, scientifically test-tubed kids.  You know, his kids are, like, test-tubed out.  Yeah, yeah.  They are the whitest, blonde-haired kids. 
[03:28:30]  And no fucking way.  Because you look at young Michael Jackson.  He was a young black kid.  Yeah, he was blacker than me.  Yeah.  Blacker than flavor.  And big Angela Davis afro and shit like that.  And the fucking guy puts out, like, Dutch children.  But I had to meet him in, like, somewhere in South.  I met him in Bahrain, in, like, a Muslim country.  Because I lost my passport.  So I had to stay at the prince's house or castle or whatever for an extra week or whatever.  But this idiot didn't tell me, me being a black man, that Michael Jackson lives next door to him. 
[03:29:00]  He's the guy that's suing him for $7 million.  For what?  The prince Abdullah Khalifa.  Suing Michael?  For what reason?  He paid Mike, well, not only did he pay all the court fees to get out of the molestation situations and the children crap.  So he made him, like, a citizen of Bahrain to avoid the U.S., you know, getting locked up.  Wow.  Whatever.  So, but then he gave him a record deal at the same time.  And part of the deal was, you know, he was...  Put out a fucking record? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Well, Michael Jackson was like, hee, hee, hee.  He danced his way out to fucking Ireland somewhere.  Getting drunk and eating fucking white pudding or whatever.  Having to get out of the country, probably dressed up like Michelle Pfeiffer.  So I walk in, because he said, yo, half of this house is yours.  Stay for a week.  So I go get some tea from the pool.  And Michael Jackson was there with white shorts.  And his legs was white.  I was like, am I the only one to ever, like, witness this?  Like...  Wow.  Yeah, you are.  You've never seen him in shorts.  I don't know how many people get to see Michael Jackson. 
[03:30:00]  I mean, did he bleach his legs?  All the fucking prints that put less chlorine in that pool.  I guess that might be a problem, but...  And I totally forgot that I worked for Eminem.  Because, you know, Eminem had the video at that time, stepping on his nose or whatever.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  So I'm like, yeah, you know, I'm with Eminem.  And then he's like, oh, Eminem.  But he actually bigged up Eminem, which was kind of weird.  And then it just came to a point where he was supposed to leave in five minutes.  And he started hanging out tough and going to the mall with the Muslim outfits and looking 
[03:30:30]  like a girl.  Like, it's crazy.  And he's cursing.  I'm like, I told him that they're about to take your, you know, whatever that land he got,  that fancy land.  Netherland.  Yeah.  Netherland.  Did you see the picture of that place?  It's growing in pretty bad.  So I told him that they're about to take it.  And he's like, fuck that place.  Who can't fuck that?  Some guy fuck about Jackson, just say fuck.  I was like, wow.  Oh, man.  And then I sent the photo and video to like, it made it like all the magazines.  Oh, really?  Like, associate press put it out.  I'm just hanging with this guy. 
[03:31:00]  He didn't molest me.  Like, I want to get that clear.  Yeah, yeah.  People thought that he was fingering me.  I'm like, this is ridiculous, man.  Like, you know, he wasn't homophobic when I was there, but he was cool.  Apparently.  He loves 50 Cent.  Does he?  He does?  Yeah.  And then I don't know about the woman.  I've never seen him with a girl.  Yeah.  Anytime he's been with a girl, it's always been some put on kind of MTV moment.  Like when he was kissing.  Lisa Marie.  Lisa Marie.  That was awkward.  Or he would take Brooke Shields with him to some fucking awards show. 
[03:31:30]  Fucking A-Rod and Jeter's fist bump is more intimate than that fucking kiss.  It's like, ugh.  It's going to be a naval lint or something.  It was bad, man.  I don't know.  But has anybody ever come up and say that they fucked Michael Jackson like a girl?  Like, ever?  No.  In these 50 years?  I don't think so, no.  Yeah, there's no, like, scandal of some woman going, oh, yeah, he's fucking, ooh, he fucked  the shit out of me.  He tagged me in the ass in Colorado.  It's not that happening.  Even in his touring, like touring, nothing?  Nothing. 
[03:32:00]  No.  That's crazy, yo.  Hey, can you explain?  Something would come out.  Can you explain Tupac to us?  How is he dead and he's got 10 records that came out after he died?  So rumors had it he did over 100, like, over 180 records with Suge Knight.  Really?  If Suge Knight was behind you, you'd be rapping all day, so.  Yeah, that's true.  Keep going.  All right.  You just explained it.  Yeah, so, you know, but the thing is, some people say he's in Cancun sipping on, you  know, champagne and just, like, still doing records. 
[03:32:30]  Do you really think?  Must look fucked up.  A skeleton sitting there with a fucking, with a tattoo or shit, like, I never saw a skeleton  with a tattoo.  Have you?  Shit, man.  He's not, he's not alive.  Someone would have tweeted a picture right now.  It's just, it's ridiculous.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like Biggie, because you could tell Biggie had no records, because they keep, Puff  Daddy keeps recycling them.  I know.  That's where he makes all his money from.  He's dancing.  Do you respect Puff Daddy?  I respect his, like, hustle and his business savvy, but.  Oh, he's smart, putting on clothes and fucking color and shit.  Like, perfume and proactive. 
[03:33:00]  Like, you know, I don't got no pimples anymore now.  I'm so happy, yo.  That's his fucking gimmick?  I mean, because of him, I started using it.  Yeah, yeah, you started using it.  His video blogs are very entertaining.  He's a funny, interesting guy.  He's like the tweeter king or something like that, you know?  When he was talking about, what, is Kentucky Fried Chicken better than Popeye's?  And he went on for fucking ten minutes, and you're like, all right, they'll both fucking  kill you.  No.  I'm like, give me a break.  The only cool thing is Exhibit put him out there that he got caught in a gay club, but. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Puff did?  Yeah, Exhibit caught him.  I don't know what Exhibit was doing there.  Unless it's you going, oops, and running, like, here's the picture.  Or, the only legitimate picture of you in a gay club should be this.  Whoa!  Out the door, still pick of you running with your eyes all big, like, holy shit, I'm going  to get in here.  This used to be a coffee show.  Yeah, what the fuck happened?  Where the bitch is at?  Yipes.  Yeah.  But you shouldn't be like, fucking, what's his name, and the Sopranos dancing around. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, hell no.  You're definitely not.  The guy with the Al Pacino and Cruisin' hat on.  I don't know, man.  Yeah, he's a very exclusive individual, also, Puff Daddy.  But he changes his name every year.  Next year, it's going to be City, I heard.  Yeah.  Is it going to be City?  Yeah, because it matches with New York City.  He's getting close to shitty, so he can stop right there.  Oh, shit.  He's getting there.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no, here we go.  Damn, no invitation to the fucking white parties.  Puff Daddy doesn't shoot you.  He just forces you to listen to his music. 
[03:34:30]  Yipes.  Yeah.  You guys got a nerve to be scared of me talking shit.  You guys are the worst.  What's the new song he has out there?  We tried to like it.  We couldn't like the new song.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Diddy Bop.  What about Diddy Bop?  You didn't try to do it?  You didn't try to do the Diddy Bop?  I didn't see it.  How about you try?  I didn't see it.  How about you try?  I don't want to try to do the Diddy Bop.  I refuse.  Yipes.  I refuse.  I'd rather do the Nanopuss dance.  The Nanopuss?  Yeah.  What do you do on your show? 
[03:35:00]  Music?  Well, basically, it's like I interview all the Hollywood losers out there that allow themselves  to get annihilated by me, but it's every week.  It's like porno stars, sports stars, Hollywood stars.  That's pretty cool.  New music, and then we talk shit all day.  But you guys are more controlled.  You got producers.  We don't...  Well, neither do we.  I can't believe you.  Yes.  I mean, you know, this guy's licking ass like Rihanna's ass.  I'm still licking her ass later.  Well, that's on a program I don't know if I'm allowed to even have it.  I know.  I heard it.  How about you getting away with a camera? 
[03:35:30]  Jesus Christ.  But you got live streaming, and you got the actual amounts of people listening.  Yeah, but I'm just drinking.  I'm fucking down there drinking.  That's hot, though.  I like that.  It's fun.  Three million people watching you drink?  Fucked up.  That's gangster, yo.  Drinking and fucking...  Drinking.  Danny's drinking.  You put a Pepsi ad on there or something.  I just got fucking a bar put down there, a theater, and a little studio.  And I go down there.  It's my sanctuary.  And Rihanna's ass.  And Rihanna's ass up on a fucking big green screen.  I shove my face right in there, and someone's screen captain. 
[03:36:00]  I don't understand.  Jimmy was talking about that.  You guys don't have sex tapes out?  You don't have no...  You ever had a sex tape leak or anything like that?  No.  You know what?  I've never had a tape in the camera.  I've monitored with the camera hooked up to the television, where you can kind of look  and go, hey, look at that.  I look like an idiot.  But why tape it?  You're not going to watch it afterwards.  Oh, for real?  Yes, you will.  Not really, Jim.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've taped it, but you've taped it so far.  Yeah.  Not recommended until you're in a certain type of physical shape. 
[03:36:30]  Because when you're watching, and all of a sudden you look up and you see your fucking  pregnant woman's stomach hanging over it, and you're like, ugh.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's a bit much.  Yeah.  I hear you.  Placenta.  Getting back to Tupac, someone's swearing that TMZ has a recent picture of Tupac.  Where?  Bullshit.  Where was he at?  Sam saying fuck that.  TMZ has this whole bit now where they post pictures of bald black guys with mustaches and  say it's Tupac.  Oh, nice.  Oh, okay.  That's a pretty good bet.  They say he's on a witness protection plan from his baby mom.  Oh, really? 
[03:37:00]  Now, when do we get to hear Eminem on Shade 45?  Actually, this weekend.  He has a special Friday and Saturday.  How many hours does he get to do?  Like four hours a year.  Wow.  He has a channel named after him, and he gets fucked up.  Damn.  I mean, he says a couple of drops here and there.  That's a hell of a gig.  I mean, 50 Cent does it like 10 times a year.  His contract is four hours a year.  Yeah.  Imagine four hours a year, dude.  But that's hot.  What four hours a year?  What are we doing wrong?  Do you get up and go like, oh, fuck, I gotta go to work. 
[03:37:30]  When you ask Eminem to go somewhere, he's like, I can't.  I got a radio show in February.  I can't.  Oh, shit.  How bad do you want to fire Robert Eatman right now?  I don't know.  How bad?  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Yeah.  Maybe I was a little intoxicated at that point.  Wow.  That's hot.  I had to be honest with you.  That's actual size, by the way.  She's tall.  She's a very big gal.  She's a big girl.  Big girl.  She had a great ass.  She's got a clean asshole, too, man.  I see you going for it.  I went right in.  Look, I'm right at ground zero there.  Yipes.  Jesus.  Bug right in. 
[03:38:00]  That's the fun of a green screen.  That's good to wake up to, man.  I'm going to have this on my computer when I leave it.  I can't believe the company wouldn't want this running.  1-877-YO-ANTHONY with you licking a green screen with an asshole open in front of you.  Come on.  That's what it's about.  It's fun.  Yo.  You guys are Chris Brown, Texas, with the suit, man.  This is serious right there.  That's hot, yo.  What a child to lick the hiney on the fucking TV.  I am stupid.  That's like taking your finger and going shukka, shukka, shukka against the vagina on the  television when you were 12. 
[03:38:30]  You see him, child?  I know you're right.  The first thing you want to say is, how old are you?  I know.  I'm immature.  What can I say?  I think it's awesome.  You know, but the thing that's crazy, like speaking of all the sex stuff, I got the final  beef for the Hollywood guy.  Wow.  Nick Lachey beef, man.  Yeah.  With Sean William Scott?  Yeah.  That started on my show.  Like, it was really interesting.  Really?  That's the fucking...  What are you going with in this one?  I mean, it's only like 30 seconds, but you figure it out.  We like Sean William Scott, though.  Yeah.  Well, you love him after what he says on this.  We got one of the rumors we want to get out of the way that we 
[03:39:00]  get off the internet.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, we're going to...  Because your hip-hop police is going to get you out of here.  But what is one of the...  I heard you had beef with Nick Lachey, man.  Oh, because I fucked Jessica Simpson?  Yeah.  Oh.  No, but I did.  One rumor out the way.  Yeah, no.  Yo.  He's been on our show three times.  How about you share that info with us, Sean, you fuck, as we promote every one of your  shitty movies?  What the fuck?  Exactly.  You motherfucker! 
[03:39:30]  Come on, all these movies, like, we give a shit.  Damn it.  And you have that info.  I like how he goes, oh, because I fucked Jessica Simpson.  Like, oh, is it that thing or the other thing where, you know, I didn't pick him up  when he was...  He's never told you that?  No.  And he's been on three times.  He loves us.  He does the whole show.  No way.  He told us he fucked Jessica Tandy.  It's a little different.  He had sure as hard.  What did he say about that?  I mean, you know, he was just...  I was shocked.  Wow.  I fainted twice, you know?  Yeah, but when did he fuck her?  When she was fat or, you know, Daisy Dukes? 
[03:40:00]  Probably Daisy Dukes when we were doing the movie.  Oh, good God.  And she was in prime shape right there, right there.  Right now, what is she, like, Oprah Winfrey-ish right now?  What's going on right now?  She punched up a little.  No, she lost it.  Did she lose it again?  Actually, one of the gossip sites have her back in the Daisy Dukes.  She got booted off the tour.  She was touring with the Rascal Flatts, but she kept crying on stage and forgetting the  words, and they fucking gave her the boot.  Really?  She was unraveling, I think.  Crying on stage.  I heard that, yeah.  Finally realizing her father's a creep, I guess.  She really gained all that weight. 
[03:40:30]  I thought that was, like, a fake photo, like a fake person.  She had the mom jeans on.  There were a couple of them.  That shit doesn't look good on anyone.  I don't care who the fuck you are.  Flat ass.  They try to bring back that mom jeans.  The mom jeans.  I've heard that in a while.  The pleats on the pleats, and they go way above, almost to the belly button.  Yipes.  Jesus.  Just heinous.  Yeah, there you go.  That's tits to the belt.  Tits to the belt.  She got it back.  All right.  She actually looks good right there.  You know who got really fat?  You see the latest picture of Kelly Clarkson?  Nah, really?  Go to a...  No way.  She did not get fat, yo.  Dude, wait till you see his picture. 
[03:41:00]  Come on, man.  Did she have a little weight issue during Idol?  She must have, because you got to see...  Almost unrecognizable.  Why am I gossiping on?  Right there.  There you go.  Come on, man.  You're calling her Kelly Cartman.  Let me see her.  Oh, no.  That is Kelly Clarkson.  No, she looks like an Aussie in 1986.  Wow, she does.  That's fucking Ozzy Osbourne on the fucking No Rest for the Winter tour.  I love you!  That should really be against the law right there. 
[03:41:30]  What the fuck did she do?  Holy shit.  What side is that on?  Damn.  She fattened herself titless.  She fucking got herself to the point where she fattened up to where her tits went away.  Jesus, yo.  My God.  What was she eating, yo?  Fucking Christ.  She must have ate like a hundred dicks.  I don't know what the fuck, but...  Wow.  That's amazing that your body could change so drastically.  You know what?  You gave us bits today.  I'm going to give you a bit.  Uh-oh.  You know, I'm going to give you a really good bit. 
[03:42:00]  Anthony brought this one to the table.  Uh-oh.  You blaming me?  Everybody want a piece of my chicken.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  Fried that chicken.  Fried that chicken.  Fried that chicken.  Have you heard that one yet?  That's hot right there.  Oh, yeah.  This is all video.  It's great.  Yeah, give him the whole version.  Give him the whole version.  For some reason, it's this woman in the middle of the woods.  To start rhyming?  And she's making chicken for a bunch of kids at the table. 
[03:42:30]  And she's in the middle of, like, the fucking woods.  Her follow-up hits.  It's Peaches.  She's got, like, two million hits on that right there.  It's Peaches.  Her follow-up hits sucked.  What was it?  The tub one?  Oh, the tub.  Yeah.  It's the rip-off for the fucking fried chicken.  That's hot.  Very racial.  I like that.  That's very racial.  Not exactly a diverse group of children there, either.  Why do you have no white kids in there? 
[03:43:00]  White kids don't like chicken?  What happened?  With the Asian kid, the white kid, the fucking little Indian kid.  There's no racial equality in there.  No.  I mean, equality in there.  Like, come on, man.  Like, white kids don't like chicken?  You like chicken, right?  No.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Why not?  But, you know, Peaches don't cook for white kids, I guess.  Peaches don't, fuck you.  Is that a shower cap?  What is she wearing?  I don't know.  She's got something on her head.  I thought that was Whitney Houston or something.  Shower cap.  It could be now, right?  Whitney just lost the money. 
[03:43:30]  Whitney had so much wholesome credibility when she first came out singing about, you know,  the future of the children.  The children of the children.  Man, now she's fucking the children.  And then she's fucking children with the crack and the fucking shitting herself and farting.  She's fucking Brandy's a little brother.  Like, come on.  Like, raging.  That woman can sweat.  I've never saw anyone fucking sweat like Whitney.  She's mopping that shit up all the time.  She was actually the first black, sexy, anorexic chick. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, she had nothing.  You'd see those collarbones just popping through.  She would sing her fat off.  Like, it was crazy.  Oh, my God.  Horrific, man.  She's like Celine Dion's negative.  You think she fucked, you think she fucked, what's her name, in Bodyguard?  You think, uh...  Kevin Costner.  I think Kevin Costner.  Come on, man.  You was covering her the whole time.  There were rumors.  You gotta think he tried, right?  You gotta think you, you gotta try.  There were rumors.  Hopefully she fucked Mike Starr, the other bodyguard who got jealous.  Well, you know a lot about that movie. 
[03:44:30]  I sure do.  I hope she passed out.  Fucking Mike gave it to her right in the rear while she was asleep.  Kevin Costner didn't swim in her water world?  Yeah.  It's kind of weird, you know.  Very moist down there, too, I heard.  Maybe it's dry land now.  Yeah, it's menopause, menopause.  We got very talented listeners, and they made this song, too.  Get out of here.  Go ahead, go ahead.  Just a piece.  I'm going to take it, buddy.  I give it all up to me.  We're moving on.  We're moving on.  Wow, that's hot.  I'm going to take it all up to me.  Yeah, I remember that one.  I'm going to take Ant's money and give it all up to me. 
[03:45:00]  We need that for Junior, man.  Barack's going to take Ant's money and give it all up to me.  That was the song.  May.  May.  May.  May.  Yo, who is that?  We need to sign up.  I don't know.  That was pretty good, though.  That's pretty good, right?  Yeah, man.  It's better than some of the arts we have on Junior.  Better than fucking Peaches.  Oh, shit.  A couple of peaches and a fucking racist barbecue.  One fucking white kid in there and everything would have been fine. 
[03:45:30]  Where are the white kids at?  She's awful.  Well, at least the chicken is white.  Yeah, yeah.  She flowers that up.  And she's like, I got me a pan.  She starts fucking singing.  She looks like Fred Berry.  Yeah.  She does.  She looks horrible, yo.  Oh, yeah.  She is really nasty.  Jesus Christ.  Somebody actually banged her?  Yeah.  Goddamn.  Hey, can we get the answer to a question that's been bothering me for a long time?  Go ahead.  Why did Rerun like the Doobie Brothers?  I've always wondered that, you know.  Because I never wanted to dance like that. 
[03:46:00]  But it was in the script.  Fucking lame.  Did you copy that?  Did you copy his dance skills?  Like, hell.  But why would he drop the recorder?  Does the entire concert stop?  Like, people have illegally recorded shows before, but how come he drops it and everyone  in the auditorium is shocked?  The band is shocked?  Why would you just talk to him after?  Yeah, who kidding?  We got questions.  Come on.  Oh, my God, man.  Help us out with the Rerun.  I'm partially white, because that's the only reason I'm up this early.  The black side is still at home.  Only the white part is here, so I'm not very well informed of that. 
[03:46:30]  Rerun did a movie called Vice Squad.  He played a sugar pimp named Dorsey.  Oh, yeah.  And fucking Wingshauser with a switchblade stabs him in the balls through a silky robe.  It's fucking great.  And he goes, no!  He's getting stabbed in the fucking balls with a switchblade.  Wingshauser was badass for about five minutes.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  There's just some things you just kind of just, you know, let it just ride.  Yeah, just whatever it is it is, I don't even want to think about it too much.  We got questions coming in for the Who Kid.  Shade 45.  He's the star of Shade 45. 
[03:47:00]  Not Eminem.  Eminem does four dumb hours a year.  Holy shit.  And making a phone call here and there.  What the fuck?  Who's his agent?  We need that great.  I mean, you don't think that's hot that you can show up for and then you have, like, maximum  promo?  And by the way, Nick Cannon did call out Eminem, so.  Yeah, that's crazy, right?  What does that mean, though?  Anything from Fist to...  I don't know, man.  I can't.  He's not a violent guy.  Oh, yeah.  He called him out.  What does that mean?  I mean, Nick Cannon is not a violent guy.  Definitely not.  You know, I'm his twin brother, so there's no way, you know, I know I'm not gangster shit. 
[03:47:30]  Let's go to Nick Page in Toronto.  Nick Page.  DJ Ruke, what's up, bro?  What's up, man?  Man, I love your mixtapes.  So, a couple questions for you.  One, Eminem's new album.  What do you think of it?  It's definitely a classic and the white people will be drugged up heavy for the next two weeks.  So, the drug flow into the U.S.  If anybody's in, like, you know, like, overseas that's transporting the drugs in, do it now. 
[03:48:00]  Because the sales will be going up.  And I hear he's releasing a second album.  When's that coming out and what's that about?  Because I know the first one's heavy into drugs.  What's the deal with the second album?  Rumors has it is supposed to come out, like, around August, September.  And then I think he's, like, cremating his mother, like, the whole album.  Really?  He's also releasing a mother video, like, where he's bashing the mother, like, with a bat or something.  That's rumors, though.  Really?  Yeah.  But you're the guy, so is it rumors or not? 
[03:48:30]  And when's your next next mixtape coming out, bro?  I'm actually doing one with 50 Cent now.  It should be out, like, in another week where I think he's going to be, like, cremating everybody again.  The usual.  Hopefully we'll get Opie Anthony to host it.  It'll be kind of hot.  Oh, yeah.  I'm about to keep us out of here.  I think primetime will, uh...  I mean, I'm going to use all the audio from this interview.  I know you are.  And he's a mix master, so I can only imagine what he's going to make us sound like.  We're going to start shit-talking Houdini.  You guys are just going to have totally innocent statements with all the fire. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, some high-def pics of each or one of you guys, and then we'll put you on the front.  We'll do, like, a mob-style, like, you know, a family tree.  Yeah!  You know what I mean?  Well, that'll fucking work.  We'll get it cracking, you know what I mean?  So that's cool.  Thanks, Nick Page.  That's kind of crazy.  Have a good one, DJ.  Woo!  Sorry about that.  Cut off his...  Do your fans, like, use drugs and smoke weed while they listen to you guys, too?  No, no, no.  They're more, like, educated and...  Oh, yeah.  So educated. 
[03:49:30]  Very white over here.  Very educated.  Okay.  Very square.  Very straight edge.  Everybody smokes weed on my show.  If only those people would come to the live shows we do.  The live shows only...  Different story.  Yeah.  Our audience actually...  Eight drug addicts come to the live show.  The type of people that drink vodka while they shit.  Yeah, we got a lot of alkies, that's for sure.  I never had, like, real crackheads, like, interviews, like, bring them up here and just  ask them why.  Yeah, we got homeless Charlie.  We had one and we got suspended for fucking 30 days. 
[03:50:00]  30 days.  Get out of here.  Are you serious?  Oh, shit.  Big story there.  Why don't you just have, like, DMX come up here?  That's like a live specimen right there.  That's true.  We had homeless Charlie come up and he started talking about some shit.  And he kind of talked about the first lady and...  No way.  And Condoleezza Rice and the Queen of England and what he'd like to do with them.  And apparently they thought a homeless lunatic ought to be a little more sane.  And decided they would kick us off here for 30 fucking days.  No way.  The satellite side, too. 
[03:50:30]  That was satellite side.  That wasn't even regular radio.  What?  Regular radio let it slide.  He called Condoleezza that bush bitch.  He was a funny dude.  He was hysterical.  Homeless Charlie was a funny guy, man.  He was hysterical.  He was kind of a Richard Pryor to him, to be honest with you.  Yeah, he had the same kind of cadence and he was just a very naturally funny dude.  He was great.  Great timing.  I want this guy.  Can I get him for my show?  I'll try to find him.  His address is Manhattan.  Start looking.  His address is bad.  57th Street.  Where on?  You don't understand.  57th Street.  Okay, if you believe in conspiracies, we haven't seen him since. 
[03:51:00]  No way.  Oh, shit.  For real.  Like an XM van drove up and threw him in.  Angels and demons type shit going on?  We haven't seen him since.  No way.  That is the truth, yep.  All right.  This is good.  You got to come back.  Anytime, man.  I like this.  You know, good, you know.  I want to hear some more shit that happens over your show, man.  Gunfire.  I got to bring you the admittance to the gayness show that I have.  Really?  I don't know how Hollywood people admit to the gayness.  I'll bring those clips next time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The clips you bring are great. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  We're going to have Sam Roberts back on the show.  Anytime.  I'd like to admit to something.  I am a producer for a radio show.  Just look out your window.  I already told Sam he has a slot on my show.  Because I need the white element.  Sam's the shit.  I listened to the appearance.  Oh, I mean shit.  Sorry.  I don't know what that bug comes out.  I listened to Sam's appearance on your show.  It was really good.  Yeah.  He's going to be entertained for like an hour. 
[03:52:00]  Stop it.  You really.  Stop it.  You have a good show, man.  Not only that, but he's like.  I don't know what you're talking about half the time.  I don't speak your language, but easy.  I'll pause for the ebonic, you know, transfer.  You can teach me a few words, because I used to use the word cheddar to try that.  Oh, cheddar?  Not cheddar.  Cheddar.  Cheddar.  I do everything wrong.  No, but Sam got a show.  Anytime he wants to come up, I give him a nice slot.  He's a very unique individual also, because his style. 
[03:52:30]  I thought he was joking, but he really talks like that.  No, he's really like that.  Half the time, you were making fun of his voice.  Like, come on, man.  That's not your voice.  I thought he was like.  Compliments.  Yeah, I thought that was like, I don't know, some special technique that I'm trying to  copy or something.  Oh, he's special, all right.  Nobody knows what race or gender Sam really is.  Yeah, what are you?  I'm just a white guy.  Do you think he's black?  A little bit black?  There's something in there.  I mean, he has a little orangeness to the hairpiece.  Yeah, he was Thomas Jefferson's in his ancestry.  For real.  Seriously?  And we know.  Presidential?  Old TJ used to like going out to the house outside every so often. 
[03:53:00]  Old TJ.  Wow.  I'm thinking maybe.  Hey, it's in the record box.  Slave banger.  Yeah, yeah.  It's in the record box.  I'm thinking maybe throughout a few generations.  Sperm transfer?  Sam pops out with that head of hair, and the parents are like, where the fuck did that  come from?  Well, how about you read a history book, and we can figure out exactly where that came from.  I know you're a wrestler, but I don't know about all the other stuff.  He's not a wrestler?  He saw the tapes?  He saw the tapes.  Oh, yeah.  That should prove you're not a wrestler.  You couldn't sell shit on that ring. 
[03:53:30]  He was impressed.  So you're just a straight white guy from like Nebraska or something?  No, from New Rochelle.  Oh, New Rochelle.  Oh, yeah.  You're white.  Come on.  New Rochelle.  Look at his face.  He's definitely white.  Something going on.  He does have something going on.  Opie always says, I have black man eyebrows.  Yeah, you do, man.  How about you don't say that in front of Who, kid?  I know.  That's what you say.  It looks like Quincy Jones eyebrows.  Quincy Jones eyebrows.  That's crazy right there, man.  Wow.  This guy's exclusive, man.  Yeah.  Travis just spoke in my ear, so if this is something I shouldn't be saying, that's Travis  right in there. 
[03:54:00]  He said that maybe somebody in this studio might be responsible for Sirius' no insertion  policy on the radio.  Yikes.  You're the one we have to blame?  Yeah, you can blame me.  It's all good.  Damn.  I can't get in trouble.  What'd you do?  I don't know.  Insertion?  That's what they said.  I don't know.  Oh, because I kept saying that?  Oh.  It's okay.  No, we're saying because we're not allowed to insert things into women.  Oh, we're not?  We're not allowed to finger pop broads anymore.  Oh, you talk about that.  Oh, for real?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's wrong with that? 
[03:54:30]  Did you do something on your show?  I fingered my girl every day.  I don't know.  What's wrong with that?  On the air?  Well, yeah.  I'm thinking on the air, but not with my girl, though.  It was like a porno store.  You know what else he looks like?  Um, the Lionel Richie sculpture head in the hello video.  Yeah, you do look like that.  Yeah, that's crazy, man.  Yo, I'm looking at you in a different way now, man.  Yeah.  Forget about the white thing now.  So, you're down now.  Okay.  He's just...  Mulatto.  Very light, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Sam, you should have told him this ahead of time. 
[03:55:00]  I accept it.  Jesus Christ, yo.  Help your spot.  Help your spot.  Help your spot.  We're adopting you, and you're down.  It's all good, you know?  Kidnap this guy.  Oh, uh, people want to know if it's cold in the day.  Well, Eminem is not there, so he's, like, touring.  Yeah, it's just another song we found on the internet.  Oh, true?  It's cold in the day.  Most motherfuckers, man, I mean.  I forgot how it goes.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Am I going back to the country music?  Am I going back on that?  No, we're going to do Snoop Dogg doing The Doors, Riders on the Storm. 
[03:55:30]  Okay, that's hot.  Or Riders of the Storm.  I mean, yeah, we threw up blood on my show when we played that, but, yeah, you could  get in there.  Is it good?  Oh, you made fun of this?  I mean, I didn't make, Snoop was my homeboy, but I can't control the people.  You ever smoked pot with Snoop?  What?  Smoking pot is an understatement.  It's like smoking a bush.  Like, this guy, you know, you're out of here.  I think I became a drug addict after I left him.  He literally does walk around in a cloud of smoke.  You never had him up here? 
[03:56:00]  It's ridiculous.  We had him on the phone a couple times.  No, we saw him, yeah.  You need to have him up here, and then all you guys would be drug addicts after the interview.  That'd be something.  That'd be classic for you guys.  I'll tell you, though, Eddie Money was in here yesterday, and he smelt like some good  bud.  He was fucking Eddie Money.  No way.  No shit.  It looked like he was carrying, because...  Come on, man.  It wasn't the smoky kind of, like, if you're smoking, you just reek the weed.  It was like, you got bud in three different bags to try to keep it from smelling like bud.  Come on, man.  And it was just permeating. 
[03:56:30]  Are you serious?  It was like perfume.  He smelled great.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  The only weird situation of me smoking weed with an individual is me and Dionne Warwick  and Chaka Khan.  Wow.  In the UK, smoking weed.  Dionne Warwick?  Dionne Warwick?  Dionne Warwick.  Really?  The diva.  She's no kid.  She likes the weed, huh?  Yeah.  She has the medicinal card and everything.  She's doing it.  Oh, she does?  She's got the medical marijuana card and everything.  She's chilling.  She got caught in the airport with it, too.  Really?  A long time.  It was like a couple years ago. 
[03:57:00]  I want to meet her and all I want to do is ask when they're bringing solid gold back.  My favorite show.  Hell no.  We hated that show.  Especially that old lady.  Remember that old lady in the show?  The gold is up now.  That little doll.  Yeah.  Waylon Flowers and Madam.  Yeah.  I hated that fucking doll.  I wanted to just burn it and pee on it.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  The chin looked like a ball bag.  It was ball bag chin.  Probably the way.  I can't believe you remember that, yo.  I hated solid gold.  Waylon Flowers.  Yeah.  I bet he'd love that. 
[03:57:30]  I don't know how that show survived.  I hated that show.  That was good.  That and dance fever.  Solid gold.  Yeah.  You have to do an interview, I'm being told?  Who kid has to do an interview?  Well, yeah.  I have to interview Rick Ross's baby mother right now.  Oh, wow.  Damn.  Okay.  So does Sam.  Sam is going to bring you some dirt from her, too.  When are you on, by the way?  Saturdays?  I'm on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  You guys do M&M's hours, obviously.  Shade 45, Sirius 45, XM 66, G-Unit Radio. 
[03:58:00]  Yes.  With Who Kid?  Hollywood Saturdays.  And, of course, Sam Roberts will be on there.  Yeah.  This Saturday?  Prime time.  He's on there again.  You know, I'm going to hopefully put him down with some people out there.  You know, maybe they might smack him here and there, but prepare for the, you know.  I'll take it.  I don't mind that.  You know?  He can hang pretty good.  I actually got MC Hammer next week, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are you supposed to get?  Hammer time.  We do have him.  Uh-oh.  I'm getting pissed off.  We got him, too.  Oh, I'm fucking pissed off.  That Sean William Scott shit got you tight, man. 
[03:58:30]  How the fuck are you?  You know how many fucking movies this guy pumps out that we're going to make believe we care  about?  Actually, I saw role models.  Hilarious.  I actually saw role models literally today as well.  Actually, it wasn't that bad.  It was good.  And that was all right.  That was all right.  How about that hilarious Mr. Woodcock?  I didn't see that one.  He actually made fun of him when he was trying to promote it.  So, you know, got to respect that.  He did.  For real.  He's like, let's not pay attention to that one.  He was talking about what he put in Jessica Simpson.  Mr. Woodcock. 
[03:59:00]  Thank you.  But he's really like, he'll let you know if the movie's whack or not, and he has to be  there.  Yeah.  I've known him for years, like way back.  No, we liked the guy.  He's a very cool guy.  That is cool when people will actually say, yeah, it's a shit piece of shit movie.  Samuel L. Jackson actually just told me that straight up, too.  Like, snakes on a plane.  He was like, I'm just here to promote it.  You know, I'm going to pay.  This sucks.  It's a shit.  How do you have such great guests?  I'm on Star Wars, by the way.  Yeah, I'm on Star Wars.  Star Wars coming out next month.  Fuck this snake on a plane shit.  Hey, get back to Dionne Warwick. 
[03:59:30]  You did the pop, but you didn't do the coke, right?  You're not that stupid.  I didn't really see that.  I've never used cocaine.  Those whose nostrils of hers?  Yeah.  You wouldn't be sharing coke with Dionne Warwick.  Oh, wow.  Solid white.  I'm solid white.  Yipes.  Dionne Warwick.  Let's get out of here.  All right, guys.  I think we're going to end with Snoop doing a little Riders of the Storm.  Sounds good.  Can I get a handkerchief?  Yeah.  It was a pleasure, man.  Come back and see us, all right?  Pow, pow, pow.  There goes Who Kid.  I think we're ending for today.  Yeah, let's see if we got a meeting or something. 
[04:00:00]  Can we have a meeting?  You know how you do it, man.  It's a trip.  People don't even believe we're together right now.  Like, tell your story.  You know the one I like.  Say it for me.  Riders on the Storm.  Thank you, brother.  Riders on the Storm.  That's Who Kid.  That was cool.  I think we got a little more cred.  All right, he's out of here.  Okay.  I just want to be cool in front of him.  You just want to play enough of that?  Just be cool in front of him. 
[04:00:30]  That was all right.  We're going to have to have him back.  I think that gave us a hallway cred, I call it.  I'm hoping.  We don't have street cred here, but we got hallway cred now because we're right at the corner.  We'll start with water cooler cred.  We're at the corner, yo.  We hang on the corner.  That's right.  So we got...  We just need to get railroad tracks in that hallway.  The other...  Oh, shit.  They ought to put the carpeting...  Oh, you didn't hear that, did you?  Dude, they ought to lay the carpeting down and just make a railroad track pattern on the 
[04:01:00]  carpeting.  Oh, you don't want to cross the tracks, man.  You don't want to cross the tracks.  Holy shit, that's so bad.  Yeah, let's get out of here.  All right, man.  Let's go get yelled at.  Let's see you guys tomorrow.  Hosti Spumanti.  Hosti Spumanti. </pre>
