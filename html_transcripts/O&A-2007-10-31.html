<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts proudly declaring themselves "radio shock jocks," rejecting any notion of radio needing to be "nice."  A bizarre pre-recorded segment of someone named William reciting part of "The Star-Spangled Banner" preceded the main show.  The hosts immediately launched into a discussion about their hatred of children, Halloween (specifically Opie's preference for large Snickers bars to deter trick-or-treaters), and the practice of busing children from poorer neighborhoods to wealthier ones for trick-or-treating. They also shared a story about their childhood dislike of Jane Seymour.  A listener then participated in "Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday," using a plastic horn to wake his wife.

A significant portion of the show focused on a contest where staff member Craig attempted to eat 10 pounds of candy for money.  The hosts provided a running commentary on Craig's increasingly distressed state, culminating in him vomiting.  This was followed by a caller recounting a sexually suggestive story about a Halloween "hayride through the woods" (later corrected to "gay rides") focusing on penis size. This led to a discussion of the hosts' self-proclaimed aversion to women and their "man town." Anthony then recounted a story about a male model friend, Richard, making a sexual advance on him in a tree fort, with a picture of Richard (occasionally obscured) shown to the audience.  A listener won $1,000.  The low turnout at a recent World Series celebration was contrasted with previous years, and a caller expressed his hatred for the Boston Red Sox.  The conversation then touched upon the Islanders' stadium, Al Arbour's coaching milestone, and a phone interview with Tobin Bell, star of the *Saw* franchise, who was promoting the latest film from Japan.  The show also included a segment about a news broadcast interrupted by Halloween pranksters, repeatedly mentioning the puke. A staff member's health concerns were briefly discussed.

The show introduced a "Video of the Day" segment, featuring a cheerleader hit by a falling banner and Craig's failed attempt to eat 100 candies for $100.  The infamous "Two Girls, One Cup" video and Bob Kelly's reaction were discussed again.  A Stephen Lynch Halloween song was played.  Burlesque performer Sandy Kane, dressed as a ladybug, joined the show, engaging in a sexually suggestive exchange with Craig and the hosts, referencing her "pumpkin pasties" and a marital aid.  The hosts discussed Heather Mills' divorce from Paul McCartney, selecting a sound clip for the next day's $1,000 contest.  A video game tester for Rockstar, Bruce, discussed *Manhunt 2* for the Wii, showcasing its violent content. Penthouse Pet Justine Jolie appeared in studio, with a clip of a previous spanking shown.  Recurring guest Twitchels joined, revealing details about a past mental hospital stay, past weight issues, and self-harm attempts.

A highly uncomfortable segment featured Irock, his fianc√©e Justine Jolie, and the hosts.  Irock's past on-air actions with Justine, including spanking and licking blue cheese off her feet, created tension.  Irock avoided eye contact with Justine, visibly anxious, his phone constantly buzzing with texts. The hosts relentlessly teased Irock.  Multiple Penthouse Pet of the Year contestants joined, engaging in sexually suggestive acts and conversations.  Sandy Kane displayed a large genital wart (claimed to be a skin tag) and a hemorrhoid.  Pat Duffy, a male guest, was pressured into exposing himself.  Justine Jolie and other Penthouse Pets demonstrated oral sex techniques on a blow-up doll.  The segment concluded with a performance of the song "Let Me Suck Your Cock for Halloween."

A highly sexually explicit segment followed, opening with graphic sexual propositions.  Caller Eva from PA described masturbating during a meeting, leading to a graphic phone sex segment with the hosts and female callers.  Justine Jolie, Janet Jordan, Lux Cassidy, and Sandy Kane participated in sexually explicit conversations, phone sex, and a pole-dancing segment by Janet Jordan. Sandy Kane removed her wig, and Craig showed his penis to the Penthouse Pets.  There was extended discussion of penis size, more phone sex, and plugs for various products and appearances.  Sandy Kane ended the segment by singing a vulgar song about a prostitute named Gloria.

The final segment featured a brief, nonsensical exchange before introducing Sandy Kane in costume and guest James Brown.  The segment concluded with an improvised, vulgar comedic bit involving sexual innuendo and drug references.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  People say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw! 
[00:00:30]  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Get it?  We're outrageous.  We're outrageous.  If you want to put it, feel free.  I've done it before.  I'll let you go from to my and that's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio V-Rock in the bathroom.  They are sick freaks. 
[00:01:00]  Can you pop this in or see something squirt out?  Aim it over there.  This is the worst, the worst show I've, this is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish. 
[00:01:30]  Yes, you do, William.  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  Yes, you do, William.  I will be happy, looking like a woman.  I will get rid of all my nails, though.  I will get all my girls.  Yes.  A woman with a very large tongue.  Oh, wait a minute.  I apologize.  You can't start the show yet. 
[00:02:00]  You need Roland first.  Oh, no.  Like a sporting event.  Take it away, William.  Stand up.  Move your hats, please.  Hey, can you see me by the spark of early lights?  It's for the ramparts we watch, with some gallop and lead wings.  And the rocket's red glare, God's words were steam and air. 
[00:02:30]  Gave proof to the light, that our flag was still there.  Oh, say does that star-spin the banner yet wave.  For the land of the free, and the home of the brave. 
[00:03:00]  How hard is it to become a Canadian citizen?  Why?  For an American.  After hearing that, I just, I don't feel as proud about my country.  Jose, can you see?  Jose.  Come on.  The old Jose, can you see?  And now we can start the Opie and Anthony show.  It's official.  It's Halloween.  Happy Halloween. 
[00:03:30]  I see everyone dressed for Halloween.  Yeah.  We're all in costume here.  I was hoping one dummy would come in with a Halloween costume and go, what?  Oh.  What?  I'm the only one?  What?  He's sick.  Don't call him a dummy.  Come on now.  No, E-Rock is fine.  E-Rock's going to be just fine.  It is the last day of E-Rocktober as well.  Thank goodness.  You got Halloween.  You got the last day of E-Rocktober.  You got Whip Him Out Wednesday.  It's just a wonderful day to be listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  Then we kick off Povember.  Do we?  How is that going to work tomorrow?  I don't know what that's going to entail.  We got to figure out an angle on Povember.  Povember.  Most people don't even know who Master Poe is, but trust me, by the end of the month,  you'll be sick of him just like I am.  Nice guy, though.  Very nice guy.  Of course.  Awful on the radio.  Awful.  Well, gentlemen, what do you mean?  It's just a slow pace.  He saunters.  When you call him into the studio to be on the radio, he just takes his time. 
[00:04:30]  He has no clue that there's millions of people listening.  He'll get there.  Dramatic pause.  But, you know, he would be the coolest dude around if that's why he's doing it.  He's doing it because he has no clue.  That's the difference.  Just kind of saunters.  I'm doing my slow walk.  Just in case I have to look at my peripheral vision if I'm being attacked.  By a butter knife. 
[00:05:00]  I can throw a sidekick out.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Here we go.  Halloween.  Woo-wee.  That's great.  Yay.  I, uh, I, uh, forgot to purchase candy.  What?  You talk about this, uh, off and on throughout the year.  Today's the big day.  I, I, I didn't, uh, I didn't purchase any candy for the little kids.  Which is a little strange because you have openly, uh, stated many times on the show you hate kids. 
[00:05:30]  But.  Yeah.  You're also the only one in this room that prepares for Halloween.  Yeah, because I, I don't want the little, the little bastards pulling any shenanigans at my house.  That's the only reason?  Yeah.  I thought you did it because you secretly want to take care of the little fellas.  No.  You know what trick or treat means.  If they don't get a treat, then they trick you by doing something.  I'm learning something.  Really?  Yeah.  That's why you get the candy?  Yeah.  So you take care of them.  It's a bribe. 
[00:06:00]  It's, it's yearly extortion is what it is.  It's like the little funny dressed mob comes to your house and extorts you for candy for protection against maybe an egg at your house or a toilet paper or a key on your car or something like that.  It's the little mob dressed like princesses and, uh, Draculas.  Right.  Uh, all right.  I, uh, I, that's the only reason I do it.  You think I go to the door and go, oh, look, it's a little cowboy. 
[00:06:30]  I don't care.  I would bet money you kind of do.  I don't care.  I think you do.  See, Jimmy's not.  He thinks it's a little cuter than he wanted to acknowledge.  Yeah.  Chick probably likes it.  They probably go, ah, look at the little princess.  I will, I will say that some kids are just adorable in their little, uh, costumes, but, uh, you know, for the most part, it's just, ah, could you just leave?  Take the candy and go.  I have no, no.  I'm not buying it.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm trying to think of what happened last Halloween that I wasn't, uh, I know I've been there. 
[00:07:00]  No, I've been in the house for, for that long.  And, uh, I don't remember having Halloween there.  Did we do something for the radio show on Halloween?  Was our, uh, big party last year on Halloween?  It might've been on Halloween.  Maybe that's what it was.  That was probably it.  And you had to stay in the city or something.  I do kind of remember like, uh-oh, am I going to go home and see a disaster?  But I didn't see, but this year I'm going to, uh, I'm going to be home.  I do get a little reprieve.  I'm going to the, uh, I got to go to the gym. 
[00:07:30]  Go work out.  You know, you know how it is.  But, uh, but, but then I'm going to be home and, uh, I got no candy.  I got to pick up some candy on the way home, I guess.  Is it going to be ravaged because it's Halloween?  Like, you know how the stores are.  On the day of the occasion, they wipe everything out and there'll be Thanksgiving and Christmas stuff up.  So you didn't even buy your candy yet?  No.  I'm in trouble.  See, I'm confused because you also get the best candy possible. 
[00:08:00]  Yes.  If it was an extortion thing, you could get just the right candy to take care of the job.  But you go well beyond that.  You get full-size Snickers bars.  Full-size.  I don't go for those little snacky crap things.  You know, the kids are loving my house.  When they come there, they get the full Snickers bars.  See, you're happy that they're happy.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  I just figure if I give them a good candy, then they'll leave my lawn alone.  I'm not barking. 
[00:08:30]  I don't know how the neighborhood is either.  When I lived in Great Neck, that was a different story.  They were busing in some urban children.  This neighborhood, I really don't think they do that.  But I do think that the parents probably do escort their children around the entire time.  You know, the busing in of the urban children is pretty much true.  It's absolutely true.  I'd love to, like, argue that with you, but it's true.  Because when I was a youngster, my parents knew where all the rich neighborhoods were,  and that's where we went for...  You just went to... 
[00:09:00]  Well, I think for two reasons.  I think they knew...  Driving around in the station wagon.  Well, in the bus, the Volkswagen bus.  Oh, the Volkswagen bus with no seats.  Without the seats, right.  And you had to hold on to where...  So the huge children could just bounce off the inside of the van.  And we would go to the rich neighborhoods because of two reasons.  The candy was better for us.  And I think they also thought it was a bit safer as well.  So the busing in of the urban children, I fully buy that.  Yeah.  I fully buy that one.  And I know because I experienced it one year. 
[00:09:30]  But I don't know what this year...  And I think the parents probably escort the children around and then look to see what they gave you.  Because, you know, they are, you know, the neighborhood is...  Well, there's a lot of, you know, the Jew.  With their claw.  The Jew.  So, yeah, I guess they want to look in and see and go, okay.  He's on the up and up. 
[00:10:00]  The guinea knows how to give out candy to our kids.  Oh, they're going to study whatever you give them.  Hey, come on.  They see the Nazi crap.  They're going to be like...  Nazi crap?  I call it Nazi crap.  You call it...  What crap?  You call it love in the era.  I get it.  I'm a collector.  But as soon as they, like, leave your house, they're going to be studying that big, large Snickers bar  to make sure you didn't, like, you know, poison the thing and then glue the packaging shut.  Yeah.  And I come to the door dressed like the old guy in apt pupil.  A better book, by the way. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, yeah.  A much better book than...  I like the movie.  Oh, it's Stephen King.  That's another Stephen King.  Yeah, yeah.  Some kid that's fascinated with Nazism and the era.  And he finds an old guy living in the neighborhood that was actually a horrible concentration camp commandant.  But he's now a nice guy.  And he just wanted to live his life, but this kid finds out and makes him tell horrible stories to him 
[00:11:00]  and he gets all, like, excited about it and it ends badly.  For who?  For everybody involved.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  Especially David Schwimmer.  Really?  Yeah, stupid David Schwimmer.  I don't remember.  He played the counselor.  Oh, okay.  And then the kid blackmails him.  On a side note, real quick.  Did you ever read the Stephen King little short story about the pedophile that takes this kid for a ride  and he's not supposed to?  And the kid's like, my grandfather's not going to be happy about this.  And then as they're driving away, they hear the son on the top of the hood of the car 
[00:11:30]  and it turns out the kid's grandfather is a vampire.  And the kid's a little vampire.  What?  Goddamn, that's Stephen King?  Stephen King, yeah.  Like, it's like, you know, one of those, you know, kid touches who grabs a kid and he  drives away with him and the kids are trying to go, my grandfather.  And he's just like, hey, dude, you better let me out.  Yeah, and he's like, you have, like, my grandson's in there, but he's a vampire and he knocks the  car over and then he bites the man and he breaks his blood.  Sounds like one of those Stephen King novels that he wrote, you know, during a three-day weekend. 
[00:12:00]  He's just hanging out.  Guy could write a book, huh?  Oh, he's fantastic.  On a moment's notice.  He's a hell of a writer.  Get it, people?  Well, there's another one he wrote about a vampire where the vampire's like a Cessna  pilot and the guy walks into the bathroom and he knows the vampire's in the bathroom  because in the urinal he just sees blood, nothing.  He's looking through the mirror.  He just sees blood, like, in midair, traveling.  Oh, my God.  I'm looking at this vampire in the mirror. 
[00:12:30]  I'm like, what a brilliant guy.  They make blood?  I don't know.  Wow, that would be.  Oh, well, if they drink it.  Yeah, I would assume.  Okay.  A little observation going on here.  E-Rock is very unappreciative of the large bin of candy that the guys put near him.  What's wrong, E-Rock?  Oh, E-Rock.  They keep bringing me this huge, oversized tub of candy thinking that I want some.  No, no, no.  Thinking you want some.  You do want some.  No, I don't want some.  You just can't have any.  Mostly chocolate.  Well, I want some. 
[00:13:00]  Health won't allow it.  Mostly chocolate.  Wow, where'd you guys get that?  That's some good candy.  Where'd we get that from?  I don't know.  Well, someone wasted their money on it.  Wait, you guys actually bought this for a visual gag for E-Rock?  Steve.  Steve bought all that candy?  Yes.  Just to annoy him.  Just for a visual freaking joke.  Why would he buy all this candy?  Now, I'm going to have a little bit of a Twix.  What do you have?  Oh, Twix?  Those are nice.  Those are good.  Nothing wrong with a good Twix.  I like Twix. 
[00:13:30]  Well, if you want to come by with your Halloween costume today, we got candy.  Are we going to have trick-or-treaters come by?  Let's have trick-or-treaters come by.  Yeah, we can do that.  When Tom walks in, go, oh my God, what a good costume.  He's dressed like a boar.  I'm kidding, Tom.  I don't mean that.  I really don't.  All right.  Yeah, it's coming in like crazy.  There's people that pay attention to this radio show, and we like you people. 
[00:14:00]  Crisco from Grand Rapids.  We love Grand Rapids, by the way.  Good morning to Grand Rapids, Michigan.  I like Grand Rapids.  Crisco writes, hey, Jane Seymour got food poisoning.  Just wanted to cheer up your morning.  Say, Crisco knows.  Yeah.  Stop, Jane Seymour!  I did hear that on the news on the way in, and all I could think of was, oh my God,  Opie's just been implicating himself all week long, talking about his hatred of Jane Seymour.  Yeah, I don't like her.  It goes back to when I was a kid, living on Long Island. 
[00:14:30]  We would come in a lot for talk shows and stuff.  A lot of Phil Donahue's back in the day.  Yeah.  Did a little Montel Williams back in the day.  I was in the audience for that.  A few others.  I'm trying to remember all the things.  Whatever.  And I came in one day with my mom and I think my sister and her brother, and we're in an  elevator at NBC, I believe.  I think we're going on the NBC tour or something.  And we got in an elevator with Jane Seymour.  My mom was a huge Jane Seymour fan from way back, way before Medicine Woman and all that 
[00:15:00]  crap.  And I asked for a picture or an autograph.  I don't remember exactly anymore.  And she actually told my mom no to her face.  And then we had the awkward elevator ride back down to the lobby.  Oh, see, in an elevator, it's like, there's not a big crowd there to see that she's giving  an autograph.  I could understand if you're in a hurry, you're on a street corner or something, but you're  in an elevator.  There's nothing to do.  You have a fan right next to you asking for a picture or an autograph and you say no.  And I never forgot it.  So F Jane Seymour. 
[00:15:30]  You should get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  Get cancer.  That scene.  F Jane Seymour.  And here's the greatest thing is that your mom was with kids.  How could you say no to somebody with kids?  Yeah.  Right.  Just makes them look bad in front of their kids.  I could see turning a kid down just to hurt him.  But how could you say that to a parent?  I hope it's exploding.  I hope it's green.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  I hope it ends with some dry heaving from the you know what, because the muscles still 
[00:16:00]  have to try to do their job, even though there's nothing left.  F Jane Seymour, I say.  F her.  I never forget.  Never.  There's going to be an investigation.  Hey, here we go.  You're a suspect.  With this bin of candy, it's going to be a bad day for Jim.  Oh, Jimmy, not another.  I don't eat candy.  It's very early in the morning.  No, I'm going to get a tummy ache.  Unless you're listening in Cleveland.  Yeah, middle of the afternoon.  Good afternoon.  It's 3 o'clock.  And Washington. 
[00:16:30]  Happy, safe Halloween for the kids out there this afternoon.  There you go.  Cleveland.  Hey, let's not forget, it's also Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  I think we've got one on the line already.  It's Julius Irving from New Jersey.  Julius Irving, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  All right.  I'm trying to wake your son up.  How are you, Julius?  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  Getting ready to head out to work.  All right.  What do you got for us today?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I got this two plastic horns.  And when I blow on it, it sounds like a trumpet, and my wife hates it.  All right.  You know how to do this?  You've got to kind of get the phone sort of close to her so we get her reaction. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I might wake up my sister, too, at the same time.  Ooh, that could be good.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Whenever you're ready, Julius.  All right, I'm going.  Plastic horn.  Yeah.  There we go.  Come on.  All right.  Shh, shh, shh.  All I can hear is Jimmy open.  Wake up.  Why?  Wake up. 
[00:17:30]  Why?  I don't get it.  Oh, fuck it.  Hello?  I just...  Why?  She just goes, why?  Why?  The first words out of their mouth are the best, because no one knows.  Why?  It's like when you come in and your family's dead.  Why?  Like, what are you...  Why?  She had no idea why you did that. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, that's not a bad way to start.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  A little low in the background here.  Why?  Why?  Twice.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Poor woman.  All right, Julius.  Thanks for helping out the show today.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  That's a good place to start.  We'll get a few more before the end of the morning here.  All right, we're going to take our first break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You want to hear what sound you're listening for today for the $1,000?  Yeah, I forgot.  All right, between 7 and 7.30, we're going to play this.  I like to make werewolf movies. 
[00:18:30]  Ooh, it's Halloween themed.  It's part of our Halloween theme.  Ah.  I thought it was retard day.  Want to hear that between 7 and 7.30?  Of course, I hope you know what to do by now.  You give us a call at 877-212-018.  Tenth Caller will win today's $1,000.  We'll be back.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, we got a very busy morning.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Halloween.  Happy Halloween-y.  We got Craig in studio.  One of our guys, during the break, he said that he could eat that whole bin of candy. 
[00:19:00]  Bin of candy that we were just talking about.  And I guess Travis weighed the candy.  It's 10 pounds of candy.  10 pounds.  And why do you want to eat 10 pounds of candy today, Craig?  Because it's Halloween.  What a sweet boy.  It's Halloween.  It certainly is going to be.  Wait, do you think...  I had like five or six pieces.  Already I feel it.  I'm like, look.  You actually volunteered and said I could eat all that. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  I can eat all that.  You could eat all that before nine o'clock?  Yeah, I'd say so.  10 pounds of candy between now and nine o'clock.  I would say that's about 45 seconds apiece.  Then he's going to do an impression of two girls, one cup.  You know, you can't just throw out a great line like that without explaining to a lot of people.  Hey, look it up.  Yeah.  Well, there's a video out there.  It's called Two Girls, One Cup.  It's one of the most horrific things.  You can't really call it porn. 
[00:20:00]  I guess it's in the porn category because the girls are naked.  But besides that, you really can't call it porn.  It is one of the most disgusting things you'll ever see in your life.  And I don't know.  We've been talking about it off and on on our radio show.  And Bob Kelly, he saw the video for the first time on the other side of the show a couple days ago.  And that video is...  Yesterday.  Was it yesterday?  No, it was two days ago.  Was it two days ago?  Yeah, it was two days ago.  It's so entrenched in my head.  And Bob Kelly's reaction, you don't see the video, but you see Bob Kelly's reaction, is priceless. 
[00:20:30]  And that video's up on YouTube.  It's called Two Girls, One Cup, Robert Kelly reaction, I believe, right?  And we'll link that hopefully to the onaradio.com website, hopefully.  It's so nasty.  And Bob is such a great puker.  Yeah.  The sound he makes.  Literally, he made it.  Just put it this way.  It's two girls doing...  Listen, they're eating a cup of chocolate mousse.  Yeah.  And it's the type that you see in Brazilian and German films. 
[00:21:00]  And Bob is...  Two seconds in, he got...  Yeah.  Couldn't take it.  Yeah.  He's so squeamish.  Couldn't take it.  Grab the garbage pail and stick his head in there.  From the second the mousse comes out of the chocolate mousse dispenser into the cup.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is my favorite part.  My absolute favorite part.  Yeah.  Because all of a sudden, the dispenser releases, all of a sudden, cup full of mousse.  It's instantly full.  It's like empty cup, all of a sudden, hey, look, dispenser, cup full of mousse.  Amazing. 
[00:21:30]  I wish my ice cream shop would give you ice cream that fast.  It would never be a line.  A third that fast would be half that fast.  That'd be great.  But it's called Two Girls, One Cup Reaction, Robert Kelly.  It's worth watching.  Don't worry, Tom.  There's no porn in this video.  It's just a reaction to a horrific video.  It's something that has taken off, actually, on YouTube.  I didn't even know this when we did it, but there's a lot of people that have videos of themselves  looking at this exact same video.  Just the reaction, yeah.  Yeah, just the reaction. 
[00:22:00]  And, well, Robert Kelly, I think his is the best by far.  I think we should spread this around the internet a little bit today.  Two Girls, One Cup Reaction with Robert Kelly.  That's what Anthony was referring to.  That's what he was referring to.  And Bob is just puking.  I thought that was Colonel Kurtz.  I thought I was watching Apocalypse Now.  Yeah.  When he takes his hat off and his head is just sweating.  And Boston would be proud.  There it is.  He's a huge Red Sox fan.  He's got his Red Sox stuff on.  Yeah, he does this for the radio show.  All right.  So back to Craig. 
[00:22:30]  Craig thinks he can eat 10 pounds of candy for the hell of it between now and 9 o'clock, right?  Not a problem.  Well, we've got to give you some kind of incentive.  I say we give him a dollar a piece, but he has to qualify.  Well, how many pieces are there?  How many pieces?  There's got to be well over 100, right?  Well over 200.  Well over 200.  Okay, here's the deal.  This is the deal Ant and I will make with you.  A dollar a piece, but you have to qualify.  And to qualify, you have to eat 100 pieces. 
[00:23:00]  Deal.  You eat 100 pieces.  You just made yourself $100.  Not 100 packages.  And then after that, it's another dollar per piece.  Dump.  100 wrappers.  Yeah.  Does he get a bonus for eating the whole 10 pounds?  Do we throw another 100 in if he eats the whole freaking bin before 9 o'clock?  Yeah, we get him to a psychiatrist and say,  we fill whatever hole, whoever left you in your childhood.  You know what?  If he was older, I would think that, Jimmy.  He's just poor.  He's a young, eager buck. 
[00:23:30]  He's just poor.  And he's just trying to make his name in radio.  This is how he does it.  He's a sweet boy having some candy.  I had to be Spuds Buckley.  Craig gets to eat 10 pounds of candy.  It's just how it is when you're first starting radio.  I don't think you could eat 10 pounds of anything.  I can't.  I don't think a human can do that.  How much do you weigh?  I weigh 230.  See, you carry 230 very well, by the way.  Thank you.  Very well.  I wouldn't consider you a fat guy.  How tall are you?  5'10".  5'10", 230.  He carries himself well.  I hear a lot of talking.  I don't hear a lot of eating.  Well, I say let the eating begin. 
[00:24:00]  Let's go.  Who's going to keep track of how many?  Run!  I won't distract the radio show.  Go ahead.  Save the, yeah.  Sam, you better get a seat.  Save the rappers.  This will be our next YouTube video.  You're filming every one, Sam.  What's the matter with you?  And don't shake the camera so much.  Oh, wow.  A little shaking going on on the two girls, one cup reaction video.  I had to run to get in front of him.  All right, well, why don't you get comfortable, Sam?  Get a seat, because this is going to take a while.  This is all you have to do today, is just sit there and film Craig trying to eat 10 pounds of candy. 
[00:24:30]  Use yourself as a monopod.  Yep.  You little rail.  All right, Craig has begun.  Two, he's opening the second rapper.  Wow.  Vlad the Inhaler from South Carolina, he writes, hey, Robert Goulet died.  Yeah.  He was waiting for a lung transplant.  And then he follows the O&A format here.  He writes, I guess God needed a creep.  Bob Goulet was quite the creep. 
[00:25:00]  Ghoul.  He put the ghoul in Goulet.  I guess God needed a Broadway star.  Did he?  Did he really?  I guess God needed an entertainer.  Oh, God wanted to hear a song.  Yeah, why take Bono?  You might as well, you got to take Robert Goulet as he's waiting for a lung transplant.  Does Robert Goulet have a famous, like, trademark song?  I don't know.  One of his.  I guess God.  He made his own.  God needed a torso with a Y cut in it.  Oh, God. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Know what the problem is with Robert Goulet?  Crystal lungs.  The reason why that creep line works so well is because he dyed his hair too long.  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with dyeing your hair a little bit if you want to make yourself, you  know, take away some grace.  No problem.  People do it all the time and they get away with it.  But what happens is you get too old and you're still dyeing your hair and it's so obvious  and then you go into the creep, the creep area. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  You just look like a creep.  Look what Bob Barker did, though.  What did Bob Barker do?  Well, he was dyeing his hair forever.  And then he reached the point where he decided he wasn't going to dye it anymore.  Because he realized it was starting to look creepy.  And he went completely, he was completely, like, white-headed.  Uh-huh.  And it just freaked everybody out.  Yeah.  Like, ah, what happened?  So it's a double-edged sword.  If you start doing it, well, then you got to continue and then you start looking like  the creepy shoe polish head.  Well, a good friend of the show, I think, took our advice. 
[00:26:30]  I meant to bring this up the other day.  Maury Povich.  Yeah.  Was dyeing his hair really dark and we were kind of creeped out and we brought it to  the attention of our listeners.  And we also told Maury.  Told Maury.  Like, Maury, the dye job is a little weird.  And I know this year on the Maury Povich show, he's still dyeing it, but it's a little.  A little different.  Different color hair dye.  It's a bit.  It's a bit more subtle.  It kind of works.  He blended it a little better instead of that dark shoe polish look.  However, we can help.  A bit more of a natural, older gentleman look. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  The older gentleman is a lovely look for a man to have.  You don't want to go jet black.  You look stupid.  All right.  Let's say hi.  Let's say hi to Cooter.  Cooter in Jersey.  Cooter.  What the?  What's up, Cooter?  Hey, man.  Hey, buddy.  Cooter, let's go.  Come on, Cooter.  Hey.  From the set ever.  We're losing you on the phone, Cooter.  It must be your phone.  He says today's Andrew from Brooklyn's birthday. 
[00:27:30]  The famous space shuttle Endeavor.  It's his birthday?  Why?  He mentioned that when we were talking to him on the air one day?  Did he?  Oh, he doesn't call.  Could you get that real fast?  He doesn't call us anymore.  Well, he's a paranoid little kid.  He doesn't work good.  Worry that his mom's going to find out that he listens to the Opie and Anthony show.  This famous Opie and Anthony clip.  Special Endeavor.  That's Andrew from Brooklyn.  And supposedly it's his birthday today.  Maybe we'll hear from Andrew.  That kid rules.  Special Endeavor.  In other news, it looks like Joe Torre's going to L.A., huh? 
[00:28:00]  Yep.  Yeah, all the denials, but he's going.  Pretty much the paper's reporting that he's going there for $14.5 million,  and that means he's taking a pay cut from what George Steinbrenner offered him.  Yeah, he was really, I think, scorned.  He just wanted out.  Yeah.  So he's going to be a dodger.  That's going to be a nightmare for Joe Torre being kind of like, whoa.  What happened there?  He's going for the M&M's first?  Oh, he's eating the M&M's. 
[00:28:30]  How many are you in?  How many are you up to there?  How many are you in?  I got seven pieces down.  Seven pieces so far?  The Starburst is going to be up.  I would skip them.  Eat them at the end.  Yeah, how are you going to eat all those Starbursts?  Oh, God.  I think that's what's going to get you.  Yeah, what candy in there don't you like?  No, I like all of it.  You like everything?  Of course you do.  Every single piece.  And they're the snack size, by the way, so.  Fun size.  Fun size.  Fun size.  Is there Starburst in there, too? 
[00:29:00]  Yep.  Oh, man.  Starburst and Skittles.  See, I think I could eat a lot of chocolate.  When it came down to the Skittles and the Starburst, that's where I would personally have a problem.  I couldn't eat any of that.  I can't eat all that.  You couldn't eat one Crunch Bar?  No, I could eat one.  How about a Twix?  Not this early.  Don't be queer.  I'm trying not to be.  But it's too early for chocolate.  All right, let's go to Paul in Buffalo.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  It's my birthday today, and I was wondering if you guys could do me a favor. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  I'm from Rochester.  I live in Rochester, and we work in Buffalo.  We listen to your show every morning, and we listen to you on the way home, and we always  make a Whippin' Out Wednesday sign, and we're not getting any girls to flash.  I just wanted to hand and ask if the girls on the thruway between Buffalo and Rochester  at about between 3.30 and 5 o'clock could entertain us, the guys in the black Ford 250 
[00:30:00]  truck with the Whippin' Out Wednesday sign, because it's my birthday today.  Here's the problem.  We've got to start pushing wow again.  We kind of let that thing kind of die.  Not die, but it was just kind of there.  Yeah, it took kind of a back burner.  A bit of a backseat.  We've really got to start pumping up Whippin' Out Wednesday again.  Yeah, ladies, these guys would love to see something.  It's his birthday, for Christ's sake.  It's Paul from Buffalo.  Help him out if you see that wow sign on the thruway between Rochester and Buffalo today.  All right, Paul.  Good luck to you.  Hey, thanks a lot, fellas.  Make sure you check out Shred and Reagan on the Edge later on today as well. 
[00:30:30]  Good friends of the radio program.  So that was it on Joe Torre, I guess.  I just feel like he's going to kind of have a tough time in L.A.  You think?  I think so.  They're so mellow and laid back.  He's so used to getting killed by the New York press.  So probably, that'll be a big and easy one for him after New York press for all these years.  Yeah.  Yeah, because they kill you so badly here.  All right.  In other news, U2 plan to build Tallest Tower in Dublin to ensure their legacy lives on. 
[00:31:00]  Is it U2 doing it, or are they just naming the building after U2?  I think they're funding it.  Probably.  Maybe with some other investors or something.  That'll be funny, though.  As soon as that building's done, you know someone's going to go,  Ah, well, we've got to build a bigger one now.  Yeah.  Rock Band sponsored the Rolling Stones building.  Right.  Something will happen.  That's just silliness.  We've got another problem with the astronauts in space.  And, well, we've got a huge rip in the space station panel.  Oh, there it is on TV as we mention it. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, apparently they make it out of tissue paper.  Every time.  They just can't get those solid panels up without them ripping.  Big tear.  Make them out of something a little more durable.  Yeah, like placenta.  Oh, there go more M&Ms.  Are you enjoying the candy?  I love candy.  Oh, God.  I love candy.  You know what's so stupid about this? 
[00:32:00]  People will listen to the show longer today just to hear you eat candy.  Yeah, I love it.  That's how dumb this radio business is.  We could try our hearts out getting into some intelligent conversation about politics or wildfires or something.  Illegal immigration.  It don't matter.  They just want to hear you eat lots and lots of candy.  Happy Halloween.  Happy Halloween to you too, sir.  Boy.  All right.  Other things going on.  I don't know.  It's kind of a slow news day, to be honest with you.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  It really, really is.  Well, we could talk maybe about my favorite person.  What?  Well, I don't like to badmouth people.  But Hillary Clinton is apparently being an evasive Ernie.  Ernie?  Yes, right gender, believe me.  When it comes to...  An evasive Ernie.  Well, yeah, she's not answering the question whether or not she's for or against illegal driver licenses.  And they really nailed her on it at Drexel University.  And she just refuses to say whether she's for it or against it. 
[00:33:00]  She's such a worm.  Wishy-washy.  She's going to wait to see which way the wind's blowing and then go in that direction.  You know, she's really bad.  But all politicians...  Something happened in the last decade or so.  None of these guys will answer a question.  Yeah.  Because you were bringing up the Obama thing.  And I know Hillary's probably the worst, you know, for most people.  But they're all just...  Answer the stupid question.  Why do you have a moderator even asking questions at this point? 
[00:33:30]  Why don't you just let them babble about whatever the hell they want?  Because that's what they're going to do anyway, no matter what the question is.  There was this candidate.  I can't remember his name, by the way, but he's not one of these, you know, not Hillary or Obama.  And they asked him about some instance where he claims to have seen a UFO.  And he said, yeah, it was a UFO I saw, an unidentified flying object.  Like, it's not necessarily a flying saucer or something from outer space.  He just saw something that was flying and he couldn't explain it. 
[00:34:00]  So then they asked Obama if he believes there's life on other planets.  Now, that's kind of a good question to ask somebody because then you see if the guy has some kind of sense of humor,  if he could come back with a goofy answer or address it scientifically.  Like, there's a few ways a candidate can go with that question.  Sure.  But you can kind of show your personality a little more with one of those questions than with these pat policy questions. 
[00:34:30]  Sure.  So he instantly said, well, all I know is that there's life here on Earth and blah, blah, blah.  He goes into this, like, health policy or some kind of one of his things he wants to enact.  Right.  He did not even come close to addressing the question.  How ridiculous it is is one thing. 
[00:35:00]  But, I mean, at least kind of show that you're a human.  Their whole job is whatever question is asked of them, they figure out in their heads how they can spin it to talk about what they really want to talk about.  Yeah, what's on their little cards.  And they should have a moderator go, look, that's not what I asked you.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, we'll get to stupid health care and all this.  On track.  We want to know about UFOs.  Tim Russell's not bad at that, but a lot of times you can only do so much.  And I don't like Tim Russell, but he is pretty good at that, at shutting them up.  Senator, and they keep going. 
[00:35:30]  What's he going to do, tackle him?  I mean, some of them just refuse.  Am I stupid to think that it would be so easy to become the president of the United States if he just showed a personality out there?  Just had a personality and didn't play the politics games?  It won Clinton the election.  I mean, who started this?  Like consultants and stuff?  I guess so.  Yeah, you know something?  Clinton had so many people behind him to groom him to be president that I think, I'm not going to say he's the first.  It's been going on for years, but he really put it into high gear where they pretty much told him exactly what to do and say. 
[00:36:00]  You look at the early, early Clinton tapes and he's just a dumb hillbilly.  And then after a while, when he started realizing and people started realizing he could be president, wow, they just started feeding him lines and he would stick to his agenda.  But you watch some of Reagan's old stuff.  It's hysterical.  That guy was turning around and telling reporters and making jokes that were a little, you know, off color at times where you look at it and think now, like, oh, my God, that would be in the paper. 
[00:36:30]  They'd be going, oh, that's terrible.  But he just gives, you know, shrugs and laughed and, you know, OK, Sam.  Right.  You know, another question.  And they say, well, he was the great communicator.  Yeah, but before Reagan, there were other guys in the office that also did the same thing.  They had just personalities in front of the American people, in front of reporters, in front of other candidates. 
[00:37:00]  Kennedy had a lot of personality on the trunk of a car.  But a lot of people say Kennedy won the election over Nixon because he made him look stupid on live TV.  His charisma, his personality came through and Nixon came across.  Nixon got sweat like a nervous wreck.  It looks like Bob Kelly.  But Kennedy, who knows if he was, you know, well-prepared, but he came across, you know, like a guy, like, just talking to America.  And then I can't be bothered with this crap on TV. 
[00:37:30]  I try to take a peek for the radio show mostly because I hate politics.  I really do.  I don't vote.  And people go, well, if you don't vote, you know, you don't vote.  I hate that.  No, I'm making my...  Every vote counts.  No, it doesn't.  No, what's the big line they say if you don't vote and you...  You can't complain.  No, there's a lot of people out there just like me.  We don't vote.  And that's how we show our displeasure with the process.  Give me a candidate that I want to vote for and I'll be online. 
[00:38:00]  No problem.  The last guy I voted for is Ross Perot.  Oof.  I think that was the last guy I voted for.  You voted for him?  I did.  Oh, good.  You put a Republican in the office.  But that's what...  No.  Because it was different.  That Hurt Bush singer.  Oh, him.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  No, I was thinking of...  What's his name?  The old safety douche that used to...  Bob Cole?  Oh.  Yeah, Nader.  Oh, Ralph Nader.  Ralph Nader.  He's suing the Democratic Party.  Because they...  Why?  Because they... 
[00:38:30]  Why is he suing again?  I didn't think this was going to come up today.  Because he's an ass.  I didn't think this was going to come up...  All right, you put seatbelts in cars.  Thanks.  I like the way you say it again, like you did know at one point.  I have no idea why he sued.  I have no...  Like, what he sued...  I didn't even look at the article.  I saw it in passing.  Here it is.  Consumer advocate and 2004 independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader sued the Democratic Party  on Tuesday, contending officials conspired to keep him from taking votes away from  nominee John Kerry.  Hmm.  So, he's suing.  He just wants... 
[00:39:00]  Sue everyone.  Punitive damages.  He's one of these guys that loves to be in the public eye and figure out ways to keep  his name out there.  But certain guys will say what they feel.  Hillary Clinton, I just...  I don't...  Now, that guy.  ...like her.  Because she's such a...  She's so built to be a politician, that's all she can be.  Well...  So phony.  There's nothing...  There's not a fun moment with her.  Right.  At least stupid Giuliani.  You know what?  The guy wears a Yankee hat.  It sounds dumb.  But at least, all right, well, here's a guy just being himself, and this is what he likes.  I think Hillary's scared of her own shadow. 
[00:39:30]  I really do.  I think she really is scared of her own shadow.  She's so phony.  She tries to have this presence in front of people, but I really believe she's just scared  of every word that comes out of her mouth.  And I'm with Jimmy big time.  When she wore the Cubs cap and then the Yankees cap and couldn't even tell anyone what her favorite  baseball team was, I'm like, done with her forever.  Forever.  Yeah.  Instead of her shadow, she should be afraid of her big teeth.  Almighty.  We should sell ad space on those choppers. 
[00:40:00]  That's stupid.  Because no one comes down to, if she said she was a Yankee fan over a Cub fan, in her  mind, she thinks people in Chicago would not vote for her.  If you have to worry that much, then I don't need you as my president.  She, uh, she's too, um, rehearsed to be the president.  Sorry.  Everything that comes out of her mouth is just this rehearsed and, and, uh, toiled over by  a staff.  She can't have one spontaneous moment. 
[00:40:30]  She's got zero personality or sense of humor.  Uh, and I, that, that's kind of important.  Yeah.  People don't realize that's kind of important to being a human being, uh, to, to run a country  like this.  I love to hear audio of her floundering on that question.  Oh, oh, well, yeah, let's go.  Uh, let's try to find that.  So she could answer that question.  No surprise.  Of course not answer anything.  Hey, Craig, uh, what are we up to?  If you're just tuning in, uh, one of our guys, Craig, uh, saw this bin of Halloween candy 
[00:41:00]  and studio that we put in front of E-Rock to make fun of E-Rock.  But then you turned the bit into it being all about you, Craig.  Uh, and the bin is 10 pounds of candy.  And you said you could eat all the candy before nine o'clock.  You're barely making a dent in this thing.  And it's been 15, 20 minutes.  I've eaten 24 pieces so far.  24 pieces he's eaten so far.  How is it?  All right.  Uh, pretty good.  I'll tell you the honest truth.  I'm actually starting to get sick.  Oh, really?  Are you?  Yeah.  Well, you can eat 10 pounds.  Like, like, do you mean sick, like throw up sick? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, like throw up, like I'm going to need that trash can.  All right.  And will you keep eating after you throw up?  Oh, of course.  All right.  Well, wait a minute.  What?  That wasn't, the rule wasn't a stick.  It was established in the beginning.  He could puke.  I don't care.  All right.  Yeah, because after you puke, then.  Was that a gag?  No, it was.  Oh, okay.  A little burp or something?  A little giggle.  I think we should allow the puke, man.  All right.  Of course.  The thing that made you puke is the worst thing you want to taste.  Yeah, and he'll have to eat more.  And he'll have to eat more.  And we're going to give you a dollar a piece if you get past 100. 
[00:42:00]  As soon as you get to 100, you qualify.  You get $100.  And then every piece after that, you get another dollar a piece.  Okay?  You're up to 24, 25 pieces as we go to break here.  Uh, let's say hi to Jesse in Jersey.  Jesse!  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  I was wondering if you guys could do me a favor and maybe play  close to Kenny's rendition of the Monster Mash in honor of Halloween.  Halloween.  Well, that's why I went to your phone call, my friend.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah?  Click.  Yeah.  While we play, close to Kenny, do a Monster Mash as we go to break on the Opie and Anthony 
[00:42:30]  show.  Getting close to giving away, excuse me, $1,000 to a buck listener.  That contest is about to begin.  But first, Monster Mash.  He comes in now.  I was working in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight, for my monster  from his slab began to rise, and suddenly, to my surprise, he did the mash, he did the 
[00:43:00]  monster mash, the monster mash, it was a graveyard smash, he did the mash, it caught  on in a flash, he did the mash, he did the monster mash.  From my laboratory in the castle east, to the master bedroom where the vampires feast, the  ghouls all came from humble abodes, to get a jolt from my electrodes, they did the mash, 
[00:43:30]  they did the monster mash, the monster mash, it was a graveyard smash, they did the mash,  it caught on in a flash, they did the mash, they did the monster mash, the zombies were  having fun, the party had just begun, the guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son, the  scene was rocking, and all were digging the sounds, Igor on chains, backed by the banging 
[00:44:00]  hounds, the coffin bangers were about to arrive, with the vocal group, the Crypt Kicker 5, they  did the monster mash, they played the monster mash, it was a graveyard smash, they played  the monster mash, they caught on in a flash, they played the mash, then they played the  monster mash, this got a lot of lyrics, out from his coffin, Drax's voice did ring, seems 
[00:44:30]  he was troubled by just one thing, he opened the lid and shook his fist, and said, whatever  happened to my Transylvania twist, it's now the mash, it's now the monster mash, the monster  mash, and it's a graveyard smash, it's now the mash, it caught on in a flash, it's now the  monster mash, it's now the monster mash, now everything's cool, Drax's a part of the band, 
[00:45:00]  and my monster mash is ahead of the land, for you the living this mash was meant to, when  you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you, what did they do, they did the mash, they did 
[00:45:30]  the monster mash, the monster mash, and do my graveyard smash, they can do the mash, it'll  caught on in a flash, they can do the mash, then you do the monster mash, oh, I'm so to Kenny  everyone, wow, fantastic, it will caught on in a flash, it will caught on in a flash, it's whip  them out Wednesday, wow, yeah, I'm real excited, real excited, for some reason, morning, Opie, 
[00:46:00]  Anthony, old Jimmy Norton, looking at puppet mouth on television, audio, yeah, there's  Hillary Clinton, on TV, Obama is becoming a major disappointment too, I loved his speech  a few years back, and he had, he just took hold of the room, he showed charisma and personality,  and then what, nothing since then, everybody loved this, it made him, it really put him  on, as they said, the national stage, and it was a great moment, but maybe he was just 
[00:46:30]  a great speaker, not quite ready to run for president, well, he fell right into the role  of being one of these candidates, Hillary looks like, scared of his own shadow, like the rest  of them, Hillary just looks like Anthony Hopkins' puppet in magic, yes, fats, yeah, fats, exactly  what she looks like, fats, without the personality of fats, and the political insights, let me  tell you something America, we need healthcare, universal healthcare, black, black, black, black,  black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black, I like when she talks 
[00:47:00]  black, that's another one of my favorites, that was fun, when she goes down south, to go to  a baptist church to talk to the people  and she puts on like a  black dialect, a little black  accent. What are you doing? Got that?  Yeah, we have that. Let's play that for the  fine folks out there. This could be your president.  I don't feel no ways tired.  I come too 
[00:47:30]  far  from where I started from.  Nobody told me  that the road would be easy.  I don't believe  he brought me this far  to leave me.  That charismatic  genuine person  could be the leader of this  country. Did you hear her just  reading and trying to  sound like that was coming from the heart  somewhere? No, what's the  story behind 
[00:48:00]  that? She's a boob.  People trying to say  that she forgot her roots and that was her way of saying  look, I haven't forgotten my roots. Look, I still  can talk like... I think she was  quoting somebody. I think  she was quoting some African-American  woman of the past  or something. I have no idea. But you don't have to sound  like a black person. Yeah. To quote a black person.  To quote it, sure. It would still just be you appreciating a good  quote. Right. You didn't hear Reagan doing  that. Where y'all going?  Tear down that wall. 
[00:48:30]  Mother  mother effers.  Yo, what's up with that wall,  man? Is that a good Reagan? I don't think it is.  That's pretty good. Hey, uh... That's a good one.  You know, hey  effers. Tear down that  effing wall.  You commie  effing heads.  It just never happened.  Yo, my  effing goods.  Well, 
[00:49:00]  where's the  effing heads at?  Oh, I could say bitches.  Yes. Don't have to bleep the  bitches.  Hey, Nancy, you  effing headed  effing.  She's a big headed  hoe.  Yeah.  I'm going to scratch.  I'm going to DJ  at the  at the podium. 
[00:49:30]  Yo, my name is  effing  Reagan.  Tear down the  effing wall.  The bombing starts in  effing  effing  minutes.  You know how to  work that  beef.  Hey, uh,  something else that's going on.  Uh, fatty  across the way.  Where'd the gold  at?  Oops, sorry.  Where'd the gold?  I want to see the  leprechaun.  Finger luck, dude.  Well,  they were giving  the man  UPS. 
[00:50:00]  I'm on the  Zoloft  to keep  from killing  y'all.  Linger  longer.  Ah, come on.  I like the fact  that you're  grabbing every  quote that a  black guy  just said.  Yeah.  And Reagan  just says it.  Now Reagan  says it.  Yes.  Well, he's trying  to relate to me.  Relate to the  African,  the Afro  American,  is it?  Well, was  when I was  growing up. 
[00:50:30]  Well, actually,  it was something  else.  It was the  but we  don't say  that anymore.  Also,  someone needs  attention across  the way.  Fatty.  Yeah.  I think people  have heard the  updates over the  last year and a  half.  There's a woman  that exercise  is nude.  She walks  around her  apartment nude  and we have  noticed that  she's getting  bigger and  bigger and  bigger and  now there's no  exercise bike  over there?  Well, I see 
[00:51:00]  her right now.  She just hung  another piece of  clothing on the  exercise bike.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's becoming  her coat rack?  Yeah.  She's laying out  some clothes.  She's walking  around in a  robe.  Okay.  Yeah, she's on  the edge of the  bed.  The robe's going  to come off  pretty soon.  For the newer  listeners, she's  across the way in  this building.  Across the way.  The building can't  be more than 60  feet away from us.  Brett, where I  said?  Right.  She has no  blinds, no shades. 
[00:51:30]  Well, she lifts up  the shades and  blinds so you can  see everything.  And turns all  the lights on.  Turns all the  lights on.  It couldn't be  more obvious that  she wants people  to look at her  naked.  But the problem  is, not much  to look at.  Well, it's...  There was a time  she was almost  getting there.  She was getting  close.  She was getting  there and then  she's gone south  again.  And we've noticed  also she has no  lady bicks in the  whole house, I  don't think.  Not a lady bick  to be found. 
[00:52:00]  Hey, Matt, the  board out, by the  way, I'm getting a  communique.  He sees her.  He sees her  window at night.  You know, we're  out of here at  nine o'clock and  this continues to  go on all day  long.  She has a guy now  and then who goes  around and closes  all the shades when  they're naked.  This guy has no  idea in the  morning, man.  She's like, screw  that.  I want to be naked  for the boys at the  radio station.  And the entire  building.  And the entire  building, right.  I'm going to think  I'm hitting this  slob.  Yeah.  Either that or  it's Danny  Bonaduce. 
[00:52:30]  Pull down the  shades before he  takes his pants  off.  Or maybe you  say, well, there's  a draft in here,  obviously.  It must be  freezing cold.  Yes, I couldn't  be hung like an  infant.  Hanging meat in  here.  What is she doing  now?  The only meat  that's hanging is  in the freezer.  What is she  doing now?  Uh, well, she  came out with a  towel.  Okay.  That she's putting  on the exercise  bike.  And is the robe  going?  No.  All right.  She keeps coming  in.  We want to see  her going because  we can kind of  see the bathroom. 
[00:53:00]  We want to see if  she has a wide  stance.  She goes in  there.  Well, God, would  that be fantastic  to just watch her?  Yeah.  And by the way,  she's not well  kept in case you're  wondering.  No, not at all.  Yeah, yeah.  There's all sorts of  stuff going on.  Scott in Iowa.  What's up?  Hey, happy  Halloween, guys.  Yeah, you too,  man.  It's an exciting  show for us today.  And I just  wanted your guy,  Craig, eating all  the candy.  Yes, he is.  Does he love the  garlic butter  sauce?  Garlic  butter sauce.  Linger Lunger. 
[00:53:30]  Well, Craig, how  are you doing over  there?  I know.  Yeah, but I want  to get even the  new listeners into  the whole Linger  Lunger thing.  See, they feel  like they're in on  the joke because  they heard yesterday's  show.  Oh, there go more  M&Ms.  Here's a bit of an  observation.  You got 10 pounds  of candy.  That's what we  started with.  Craig decided he  was going to eat  the whole thing.  For what reason,  we really don't  know.  So then we threw  a little money at  him.  If he eats 100 of  these pieces of  candy, we'll give  him $100 and then  $1 for every piece  after that.  And I'm noticing more 
[00:54:00]  and more Starbursts are  making themselves known  in that bin.  You're avoiding the  Starbursts.  Well, actually, the  Starbursts is like a  relief because it's  actually a fruity  taste instead of the  whole chocolate.  Chocolate thing.  That's what's actually  getting clogged in the  back of my throat.  How many pieces have  you eaten, son?  Son.  He's up to 33.  How are you feeling?  Pretty good.  You think he could get  to 100?  No.  Now he's just saying  absolutely not.  He was feeling, I'm  going to try.  I'm going to take  pleasure. 
[00:54:30]  Honestly, if I stop  right now, I could  probably throw up.  Really?  You can't stop, though.  No, I won't.  And I'm going to take  pleasure in giving you  absolutely no money  for this.  I got a lot of candy.  Wow.  You win.  Boy, you got us.  Hope he gets to 99 and  just can't do it.  His hand's shaking.  He just vomits.  Passes out.  He pukes on his hand  like Jeff Goldblum in  the fly trying to  use a candy bar.  Brundle douche. 
[00:55:00]  Let's say hi to  Ryan in Boston.  Ryan, listening on  BCN, what's up,  buddy?  What's going on,  guys?  Happy Halloween.  Happy Halloween.  Hey, I was just  calling in to let  you boys know about  your buddy up here  at Hillman.  What a contest he's  got going on.  What is he doing  for Halloween?  He is having a  contest.  I'm not sure what  it is.  I think who has  the biggest third  leg gets to go on  a hayride with  them through the  woods. 
[00:55:30]  A hayride through  the woods?  And the contest is  a hayride through the  woods.  Just men, I bet.  It's man town.  Man town.  Free hayrides for  all men.  Where men can roll  around in the hay with  each other as they go  through the woods.  Well, they're a hot  girlfriend, stay  home.  Whoever has the  biggest one.  I don't get that  man thing where you  have to hang out with  men and girls are  icky. 
[00:56:00]  After the age of  like, let's be fair  here.  When are girls not  icky anymore?  Goddamn.  Nine.  Seven.  Nine, ten, maybe.  I think.  How do you look at  them now?  It all depends if  you're looking at the  costumes.  The new Halloween  costumes that are  coming.  But just to wrap up,  I mean, somewhere along  the line, probably for  the most part before  ten, as a guy, you  realize girls aren't  icky anymore.  Absolutely.  So if you do a radio  show and your whole 
[00:56:30]  theme is that you live  in man town and you  hang out with other  men and you got a place  in your house where you  could hang with the  fellas.  Because girls are  just such a...  Because girls are  still icky.  There's kind of a  problem.  You're in your 30s and  you think girls are  icky.  That's something...  There's something wrong  there.  And the girls that  they know are just  like naggy, ragging  bitches is what it  is.  Like nagging wives  or girlfriends that 
[00:57:00]  they can't actually be  themselves around and  they have to get away.  That's the whole thing.  You have to get away  from them.  If you've got to get  away from them, it  could be a problem.  Yeah.  Do you want to go  into this foxhole with  the rest of your man  friends?  Let's watch the old  big screen TV.  Guys, come on.  We're coming over to  my house.  I got a nice room  built in the basement  where no women  allowed.  And then there's all  signs, like clever 
[00:57:30]  little signs that tell  the women to stay out.  Keep out unless you're  bringing beer.  Yeah.  You think they've got a  Farrah Fawcett poster on  the wall?  Probably.  With a big red circle  and line through it.  No women here.  Just fruity.  It's kind of cool when  you're eight or nine and  you've got your first  fort in the woods, but  when you're in your  thirties, it's creepy.  You don't want girls in  your fort.  That's true. 
[00:58:00]  And to tell you the  truth, I used to have  tree forts all the time.  And there was nothing  better than getting a  girl up in the tree  fort.  Or Richard.  Get the same result.  Actually, that caller  had it wrong.  They're not doing hay  rides.  They're doing gay rides.  Oh, was that it?  In man town.  Look at what E-Rock  put on the monitor.  It's not on, stupid.  It's black, you zilch.  Wait, that's the Richard 
[00:58:30]  that hit on you?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, somebody, actually,  my sister had some  pictures.  How'd you say no?  That's dead Richard.  He's a hottie.  That kid was a nine.  I'm thinking he's some  white trash like you.  That kid was a nine.  No, he was.  The saddest thing was.  It's not gay if the guy  looks like he could have  been in 90210.  Dude, the chicks friggin'  loved this kid.  Was he a male model or  something?  Loved him. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  The chicks loved him.  That's the guy that  wanted to.  And he had no interest  in girls whatsoever.  And the girls that would  swarm around him, like,  I was just freaking out  over these girls.  I'd be, like, coming in  like a vulture just trying  to pluck one off.  Right.  Or something.  And they were just,  they loved him.  And no interest.  Of course.  No interest whatsoever.  He wanted, that was one  thing he wanted.  I know the people that are  part of the Linger Longer  Club are way in on this  bit, but let's help out 
[00:59:30]  some new listeners.  Back in California,  Anthony had a friend,  Richard.  We're looking at his  picture right now, and  he looks like a male  model, let's be honest.  Well, he was.  Okay, he was a male  model.  That's a couple of years  after I left California.  And he was your friend.  I left California.  You had no clue that he  was gay until one night  you had a little sleepover  in a tree fort, and he  kind of asked you to do  something to you.  He wanted to do  something.  And then you made  believe you were sleeping  by doing some over-the-top  snoring.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He was, well, I didn't  know he was gay. 
[01:00:00]  I don't even think he knew  like when we first became  friends, because he was  very young, you know, when  I first came out to  California.  And then, you know, we  used to go fishing and  stuff like that and hang  out as friends all the  time.  And then as he started  getting older and I  started getting older, I  started, you know, really  looking for girls, and I  noticed he wasn't.  And then little things  were kind of, but, you  know, we were friends  for so long that it was  just like, I don't, you  know, I don't know.  I didn't know that.  I didn't think that until  a tree fort night. 
[01:00:30]  It's like, hey, you  want to, you know, because  we used to camp out at the  at the ranch and stuff.  And then and then it was  like, oh, you want to hang  out at the tree fort  tonight?  Yeah, sure.  Grab a couple of beers,  hang out at the tree  fort.  And then in the middle of  just hanging out, just a  quiet moment, going to  sleep.  He leans over and just  goes.  Anthony, this makes me  laugh every time.  I want to your. 
[01:01:00]  Can I your.  And I'm laying there now.  Now I'm facing the wall of  the tree fort.  Very vulnerable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I figured it was  better.  You know, the battle  lead with your ass.  Yeah.  So I'm just hearing  Anthony, are you awake?  I want to your.  And all I could think of  though is it was gone. 
[01:01:30]  Just like making the  snore.  I was so asleep and yet  my eyes, my eyes were  like opened so wide in  horror.  I was like, what?  What?  How?  What?  And then because then it  all hit me like, oh, my  God, I put two and two  together.  Were you going?  What are these strange 
[01:02:00]  feelings I'm having?  No, I was saying, oh,  my God, my bestest friend  is gay and he's trying  to, you know, get some  action.  So it's kind of, you  know, is this broke back  mountain music?  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  And then now the next  I don't know how to quit  you.  The next morning, nothing  was said.  That was it.  When did your dad have  him killed?  It was over.  No, no. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  No, it was always  suspected, but no, my  dad never.  My dad liked the kid.  He was.  Of course he did.  I think Richard saw  something going on in  there when you were  wearing those like short  jean shorts.  Of course he did.  I had my assless chaps  on.  And your dad liked that  kid because he was more  masculine and cried less  than his son.  That's true.  Oh, I want to cry,  baby.  Hey, Anthony. 
[01:03:00]  Anthony.  I want to  f*** your f***.  Why?  Why?  Of the fans?  Good thing you didn't do  it broke back mountain  style.  Just a little spit.  Yeah.  You were so right.  You were very rapable.  He has no idea.  You probably just put it  like, come on, cut it out.  And then just kind of  silently stared ahead.  I would not.  I think Richard was into  Anthony's like big doe eyes. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, he was.  Blink, blink.  Blink, blink.  Blink.  Anthony would have frozen  if Richard just tore down  his box.  Anybody else?  Anthony slept with PJ  like feet in pajamas?  No, I haven't.  It was the tree fort down  at the ranch, so  completely clothed.  Oh.  It was like completely,  you know, jeans on  and probably a flannel shirt,  boots, cowboy boots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You would have been able  to get your pants off  because it never would have  come over the cuff,  never would have went  over that boot.  Over the boots.  You would have clumsily  tried to kick your 
[01:04:00]  little Anthony feet,  but your pants would have  been on.  My little Anthony feet?  As Richard,  what he would have done  is he would have sunk  his teeth into your shoulder  and scooped his one arm  under and cupped your chest  and the other arm  would have held your waist.  Oh, God.  He would have just  taught you a lesson.  Uh-oh.  Craig, why are you  raising your hand?  If it could be a problem,  why don't you get that  picture off of there?  I know.  Hold on, Craig.  Hold on.  It's not right.  How many pieces?  How many pieces  are you up to?  37.  37 pieces.  Yeah.  You feeling all right? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, I feel...  No.  No, I don't, honestly.  No.  Where's that earlier bravado?  What are you feeling?  I just feel just a whole mound  of chocolate in the back  of my throat.  That's it.  We'll keep eating, man.  Go for the little ones.  Go for the M&Ms.  Which one do you not want?  Which one do you want to avoid?  Oh.  Oh.  Have some more chocolate.  You want to...  Take the Richard picture  off, you dummy.  I know.  Jesus.  The guy's vomiting  and no one on Paltalk  could see it.  Oh, God. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, it's too early for this.  You want a Snickers bar?  How about a Twix?  No, no more candy.  Nice thick piece of Twix.  Chocolate.  How about a nice peppermint patty  served up in a dirty ashtray?  Yeah!  Oh, my God.  A nice, greasy piece of pork.  Mmm.  Chocolate.  Look at the three musketeers.  Those are good. 
[01:05:30]  Chocolate sundae.  Ooh.  Oh, the gurgle.  I love the gurgle.  I gotta tell you,  this is the first time  I had to look away  in a long time.  I don't know what it is.  About this one.  He's just puking up  what amounts to a milkshake  made in a stomach.  Oh, the gurgle.  Oh, the gurgle.  Attaboy.  Have some M&M.  That nice, thick chocolate 
[01:06:00]  down your throat.  You want some more chocolate?  Oh, chocolate.  Mmm, chocolate pudding.  How about this?  At least smell a piece.  Would you smell a piece?  Chocolate brownies.  Open up the three musketeers  and smell it.  Beat this.  Yeah.  Beat this one.  Oh.  A baby Ruth.  A baby Ruth.  Smell the baby Ruth.  Yeah, go ahead.  Well, maybe a Butterfingers.  Nice, thick.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, oh, oh.  You want to have a bite?  Oh, God.  Again, I don't know why. 
[01:06:30]  How about rub it under your nose?  You don't have to eat it.  Just rub it under your nose  so you get that chocolate smell.  Yeah, smell that chocolate.  Mmm.  Chocolate.  I say you take a bite of it.  Even if you don't swallow it.  All right, he's now back eating  some chocolate.  No, you can just spit it out.  You don't have to swallow it.  Just feel the chocolate  in your mouth, though.  It's delicious.  Can we play We Are the World?  No, Eric doesn't have his iPod available.  Swing and a miss. 
[01:07:00]  Why is E-Rock getting paper towels?  I don't know.  He's touching everything.  Looking at Richard,  he spilled something in his pants.  All right, there you go.  I think you're okay, Craig.  Craig, you back in or what?  Oh, well, I guess that was...  Was that a yes or a no?  Yeah, and puke speak.  Is that a yes or a no?  We don't know.  Puking just hurts.  Sam's just like an AP cameraman.  Nothing fazes him.  He just sits there  and films it all. 
[01:07:30]  He's like a war card spondent.  Right.  Oh, man.  He's a rafter man.  Yes.  It's a negative rafter man.  Hmm.  You want another piece?  Yeah.  All right, grab a Butterfinger.  Have a Butterfinger, son.  Toughen up.  By the way, it's being pointed out  that you messed up  the whole Richard bit  with your puking.  You couldn't wait?  I'm sorry.  Don't you understand  that we had puking  penciled in for 740 today?  It was just getting sexy.  740 was when  you were supposed to puke.  I'm sorry.  That Richard was pretty.  We're working on  pinpoint listening.  Don't you understand that? 
[01:08:00]  What grabbable hair  that kid had.  You could have let him  toot on it a little.  It was all blonde.  Wow, you would have  wrapped your hands in there.  Anthony, make me tear.  Make me go.  By the way,  have the faithful listeners  seen a picture of Richard yet?  It was up on Paltaw.  Well, okay.  And we'll put it up  on onaradio.com later.  Yes.  The guy that wanted  to blank Anthony's blank 
[01:08:30]  in a tree fort  while Anthony  pretended to sleep.  Yeah.  That's Norway.  That's right.  All right, we got to take this guy.  And now he's dead, by the way.  When did he die?  He's dead.  Died of the Hiv, right?  Yeah.  Died in 2000,  something like that.  He really died of the Hiv?  2001.  From the obit I read,  it was something like,  and I didn't even know  until like last year,  but the obit I read,  it was something about  pneumonia in a hospice.  So, you know,  I don't think 
[01:09:00]  it was anything else.  Well, he was old school, man.  Anthony,  what are you,  early 40s?  Jesus.  If he was just starting out  in like 1975  or something like that.  He's the bareback kid.  Jesus.  The bareback kid.  Take that thing off.  Gives me a skin allergy.  Just six short years  after some Haitian  brought it here.  Oh, he couldn't stop.  He needed that.  I swear,  he just needed it. 
[01:09:30]  He'd probably be  on his hands and knees, right?  Just pushing his hips back  to zoom, zoom, zoom,  come up to my room.  Remember that song?  I'll just jam his hips  back to that song.  Kid was beautiful.  Man, what are you going to do?  There's no easy way to do this.  Let's just do it.  Here's today's sound.  I like to make  real wolf movies.  Wow.  No mystique there at all.  Yeah, we couldn't  sneak it in today.  What can I tell you? 
[01:10:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  Oh, Craig,  you're back to eating.  That's good.  This kid's tough.  What are you up to?  100 pieces.  I'm up 39.  39.  All right,  you're back in though?  Your stomach's feeling pretty good?  All right,  very good, man.  He's a trooper.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's Rob Bartlett.  I'm going to be at  the Seven Angels Theater  in Waterbury, Connecticut  November 10th  up there in Waterbury.  It's Amina De Laurentiis  and all those wacky folks.  Come on down  and see the show.  203-757-4676.  203-757-4676. 
[01:10:30]  Sex, you know,  I'm cool  and I'm not some fat  user fuck.  Hey, let's spend a minute  with Scott from Massachusetts.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Scott, congratulations.  You won the $1,000.  Thank you very much.  Listening on BCN.  How are you doing today, buddy? 
[01:11:00]  Good.  I've been listening to you guys  since the old AAF days.  Ah, right on, man.  You go way back with us.  Yeah, I'm not a prize pick.  I appreciate that.  We like giving the $1,000  to people that have  listened to the show  for a while.  But, I mean,  we have to give it  to the 10th caller  every day, though.  Yes.  We're just happy  when it works out  where it's one of our  long-time listeners  that get the money.  Hey, were you at  the big celebration yesterday?  Oh, yeah.  That was a big up parade.  They were saying  up to 4 to 5 million people  were going to show up. 
[01:11:30]  I don't know if it was that big.  I don't think so.  Yeah, that's a little high, right?  Huh?  I don't think it was  as big as 2004.  Nope.  We were just as happy anyway.  No, you weren't.  How many showed up?  How many?  Yeah, I mean...  Probably, I think,  a couple hundred.  No.  I'd say about a million anyway.  That's great, dude.  Jimmy, why can't you  do the Master Poe bit with me?  Well, I...  That was a perfect setup  for the Master Poe line.  Was it?  No, I'll tell you why I didn't.  I don't feel good about myself.  Heather Mills yelling.  No, no, but for half a second 
[01:12:00]  I honestly didn't know.  I wasn't even thinking of that.  That a couple hundred people  would show up  for a World Series celebration?  I wasn't sure if you meant that  or when they came to the plane.  I'm now sad.  No need to be said.  You don't want to play with me.  Did you do the...  I'm taking my ball  and going home.  No.  That.  No, I wasn't sure  if you were talking about  when they came back  from the plane.  So 200 might have been accurate.  Oh, no.  No, no.  This is the big parade  that they had yesterday  to show off the fact  that they won the World Series.  They're in the back  of the pickup trucks  and all that crap.  The flatbeds and all that. 
[01:12:30]  All right, so how many...  Dave Wellington from BCN  was telling me  four to five million.  I'm like, no way.  No.  Four to five million people.  Well, how many showed up, Ope?  No, I can't.  I can't.  Well, just try it.  I'll try to do my part.  I don't know, Jimmy.  I guess maybe  there was a couple hundred.  Perhaps more than that, Ope.  Welcome to Povember  starting tomorrow  on the Ope and Anthony Show.  A little preview of Povember.  What is Heather Mills  yelling about on television?  Just bring it back. 
[01:13:00]  I left it  when I went into the gym.  Just bring it back.  Before the parade,  Menino stumbled  on the stairs at Fenway  while carrying  the 2004 World Series trophy  and injured his knee.  This is what happened yesterday?  Ah, what a douche.  A spokeswoman said  he hyperextended his knee  but was fine.  All right, Scott,  what are you doing  with the $1,000?  I don't know.  Maybe I'm going to go  buy some cigarettes. 
[01:13:30]  Fix up my car.  Cigarettes are first  on the list.  Well, God bless them.  Cigarettes.  Because yesterday's guy  was like,  I'm going to pay some bills  so I'm going to pay  some car payments.  Do not pay a bill  with this money.  Have fun.  This is free money.  Free cash.  Just have fun.  All right, Scott.  Congratulations  and thanks for listening.  Thanks a lot.  I appreciate it.  I appreciate you not  listening to that  dumb man-town crap.  Uh-oh.  Man-town.  I haven't listened to that  since you guys are on there.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  We may have more issues  with young Craig here. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, no.  Craig, what's going on?  How many pieces of candy  are you up to?  Young fella?  I'm at 43.  Wow, real record pace.  43, then.  Yeah, well, as I eat more,  just more chocolate  is mounting up.  You know what it is?  Your stomach is probably  thick with chocolate.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's thick with it.  It's just coated right now.  Are you sick of the sugar  right now?  Yeah.  You're sick of it?  Yeah, you are, right?  Yeah.  I'd love some egg whites.  Oh, I would love egg whites  right now.  Anything but chocolate.  But I can't eat it.  I've got to reach  100 pieces.  All right, don't puke right now.  We've got your pencil  to puke in five minutes. 
[01:14:30]  Hold on one minute.  Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Yeah, morning, boys.  Hey, hey.  I'd just like to say  screw Boston.  Oh, yeah.  Was Rosie the Riveter  leading the parade?  Nothing like a 1940s float.  Eric.  They won the World Series.  They swept your Rockies.  Ah.  Yeah.  You think that's going to hurt?  All right, you're talking  to all of Boston right now.  Go ahead, Eric.  Beat them up.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go get them.  Go get them.  You know, just as you say,  you don't know any Rockies players. 
[01:15:00]  You know, Boston left here  three days ago,  and I can't name you  one Boston player.  Manny Ramirez, David Ortiz,  Curt Schilling,  who's now a free agent.  I can't name one.  Papelbaum.  The picture of him,  he should be placed  in front of a glory hole.  The picture that's been shown.  With his little dance.  What a bunch of weirdos.  Screw Boston.  All right, but they swept you, buddy.  Yeah, well, you know,  we're not sore losers.  I just say screw Boston.  Yes, you are.  Of course you are.  Join the club. 
[01:15:30]  Now you know how it feels.  You guys got any other  sports teams in Colorado?  Yeah, the Broncos,  the Avalanche,  which, by the way,  I hope have more Stanley Cups  than your island.  Hang up on this guy.  Jesus.  Go Isles.  Drive for five.  Drive for five,  20-some-odd years later.  Know what the stupid  islands are doing?  I'm a season ticket holder,  and I hate going  to the Nassau Coliseum. 
[01:16:00]  It truly is a dump.  Yeah.  Steve Sommer is a great  sports announcer here  in New York.  He calls it the Nassau  Mausoleum.  Mausoleum.  Love Steve Sommer.  Steve Sommer is so great  that Jerry Seinfeld  listens to him,  and they became friends.  But you don't like  Steve Sommer?  I don't hate him.  He is good, but I...  With Eddie behind the glass.  Yeah.  Schmoosing.  Schmoosing.  The New York Knickerbockers.  Shut your mouth.  We get it.  We say it the right way.  I like his delivery, man.  I like Beningo. 
[01:16:30]  There's a local guy  in New York here  named Joe Beningo.  Steve Sommer is like  a legendary sportscaster.  Yeah, he was an overnight  guy forever,  and then they moved him  out of the overnights,  and it kind of started  sounding a little weird,  but I still like the guy.  Beningo's a local guy  who won a contest  to have your own radio show  and became like this.  He's just a regular...  He's a Jet fan,  and he's just...  What a miserable...  I would...  We were off the air.  I would drive around  looking at prostitutes  and listening to Joe Beningo  and Art Bell all night.  Really?  Yeah.  They can't get it done!  He would just scream. 
[01:17:00]  He would want to kill himself  every time the Jets lost.  That guy was the greatest.  Overnight, radio guys  are the greatest,  because you know why?  I'll tell you why.  They don't have dumb PDs  coming in and yelling at you  between breaks.  Apparently, we don't anymore  either of what happened.  Maybe she's feeling  a little sad today.  Yeah.  But overnight guys,  they got the run of the place.  They have no PDs  listening to every word.  They could do whatever  the hell they wanted.  You get some really good radio  out of them.  Talk about whatever you want.  I think there's a market 
[01:17:30]  to take overnight jocks  and then replay their stuff  on the internet somewhere,  you know, during the day  when a lot of other people  could listen.  Yeah.  Weird audience, too,  at that hour.  Yeah, you get some crazy...  Like, yeah, insomniacs.  Yeah.  Serial killers.  Well, we got Boston  fighting back.  Brian, well, in Rhode Island,  I'm sure he's a Red Sox fan,  though.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Listen, I want to let  that Rockies fan know  that I have a really big  broom that he can borrow.  Oh, for the sweep. 
[01:18:00]  I get it.  Listen, you know,  you've got to be proud  of the Rockies,  you know, making it there,  but don't bash my Red Sox  because he sounds  like a real douche.  I hope you didn't mean it  when you said  you've got to be proud  that the Rockies made it.  Listen, I'm trying  to throw him a bone here  and trying to be  a stand-up guy.  Obviously, that guy wasn't.  See, you're not really  a Boston guy.  You've got to be proud  that they made it.  A Boston guy  would never say that.  They'd be like,  F the Rockies!  F them.  Right in there,  F-holes.  We swept them.  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah. 
[01:18:30]  I bet he can name  every player on the Red Sox.  You know, he's full of it.  Yeah.  He's trying to act  like he doesn't know.  All right.  Anyway, punch it out, guys.  Let me wrap this up  really fast.  So the guy mentioned hockey  and then it reminded me  of the Islanders  and I hate going  to that S-hole.  It's the worst place  to see hockey,  but I'm dedicated  to my team.  What can I tell you?  Yeah.  Yeah, you've got the Devils  with a brand-new stadium.  They're second brand-new stadium  in the last 10 years  or something,  and we still can't get  a place to play hockey  in Long Island 
[01:19:00]  that's a place  where you would like  to bring people  and show it off.  Maybe if they won  a couple of Stanley Cubs.  We did win our share,  my friend.  Four.  Yeah, four.  Win.  But anyway,  maybe this is interesting  just for a few people,  but Al Arbor,  the legendary  Islanders coach.  Sure.  Ted Nolan  noticed that  he's one short  of winning  1,500  career games.  Al Arbor's now  pushing 80,  I think.  Mm-hmm.  Guess who's coaching 
[01:19:30]  this Saturday night  to try to  get his 1,500  get out of here.  This is the type  of crap  the Islanders are doing  to try to get  a little more  interest in the team.  Wasn't Al Arbor  there for the big  dynasty?  He won a wall.  Yeah, he won a wall  and then he retired  I don't even know  how long ago  at this point.  Dude, it was  1982,  83.  He is going to be  the official coach  this Saturday  to try to get  win number 1,500.  What if they don't do it?  This is hacky crap. 
[01:20:00]  What are you doing?  I hope that not only  does it hope  he doesn't do it  but I hope that  as they do do it  his hands go up  in victory  and then the one  comes down  and grabs his chest  and old Al Arbor  goes face first  teeth first  into the ice.  1,500 wins  and no hugs  to the grandchildren.  I'm a huge  Islander fan.  Can't even be bad  at that.  That is hilarious.  Teeth first.  The shattering  of those dentures  as they skate  across the ice  to stun silence. 
[01:20:30]  Good old Al Arbor.  Oh man.  What is that  conjuring up  an awful hysterical image.  Grabbing his stupid chest  with an Islanders logo  on it  teeth first  into the ice  and his chilly nose  resting on the ice  while the stunned fans  the first thing  someone would do  in shock  is grab his teeth  and bring them back  to him  as he's laying dead  nose first  on the ice.  I'm hoping  one of the Islander players  hits him really hard  in the back  going hey it's good  to have you as the coach  tonight  and hits him hard  in the back  and his dentures  go flying out 
[01:21:00]  slide across the ice  and go into the goal  and the announcers  are a little confused  they're like  wait did the Islanders  score  oh no  it's just Al Arbor's  dentures  I hope he wins  and he's on the  center of the ice  and they go to  slap his back  and a bag full  of questionable fluid  falls off of his hip  well it looks like  he dropped some  some lemonade  and chocolate  on the ice  he must have  had a snack  with him  oh well  Sergeant G 
[01:21:30]  he's always there  to correct me  yeah they play  in arenas  not stadiums  I understand  yeah whatever  it is  technicality  yeah whatever  they play  in Al Arbor  should take  a good slipping  take a good slipping  oh well Craig  is raising his hand  yes Craig  oh no  Jesus  what's going on  over there Craig  how do you feel  how do you feel  I don't feel so well  no  no not at all  I'm at 45  you're at 45  you know if you don't  get to 100 by 9  you get no money 
[01:22:00]  for this  I know  and by the way  and we don't put  your video up on YouTube  so you don't even  become a  you don't even  become a  video star today  oh my goodness  you okay  as Craig  contemplates his next  puke  we got Anthony  he's trying to  help out the  Rockies fan  he's a Yankees  fan  Anthony what's up  what's up man  hey  I wanted to say  that Boston sucks  yeah  I'm sure they're  feeling that today  I hope all these 
[01:22:30]  Boston fans  up in Boston  are listening to me  they all know  that they're douches  yeah  it's a tough time  to go  it's a tough time  to go after  Boston sports fans  they got the  World Series  Brady's unstoppable  and they freaking  got Kevin Garnett  playing for the Celtics  I mean it's a  great  enjoy it  it's a great time  to be a Boston  sports fan  enjoy it while it  lasts  because  you know  eventually  it ends  you know what  but no one cares  about that  when you're living  in the moment  you're just  excited  oh god 
[01:23:00]  don't interrupt  Opie again  I don't know  what  sorry Opie  I could  for the most part  I could  I could check out  all this stuff  today  this is really  bothering me  I'm looking away  every time  every time  I can't  alright  I can't look  are we gonna get  to the hot  Halloween costume  thing next  what  what  yeah  what  um  alright  Toth Latrine

[01:25:30]  I can smell his  I can smell the M&M's  it was just in his stomach  a little while ago  and now it's back  I know  I understand the process  I didn't think it was magic  magic  yeah  hey by the way  we're getting requests  for a replay of this  and I'll set up  what we do after the break  this was your video  of the day yesterday  the actual video's up  on onaradio.com  if you know how to  kind of surf around  that website  but we're getting  a lot of requests

[01:28:30]  over the barbed wire fence  to make the soap with  when they took that puke  when they took that puke  in there  I'm like just leave it in there  let them smell  oh god  oh god  good boy  there you go  alright there  you got your puke  now get back to eating candy  how many are you up to  at least get 50 in you  now it's been closed  and reopened  it's gonna smell worse  47  alright get to 50  we gotta take a break  we're gonna have your  video of the day next  we're uh  we'll turn you on to the video  of the day  I know this is radio  but I mean come on 
[01:29:00]  yeah  we'll talk about it to you  everyone goes to the internets  also uh  Tobin Bell from uh  the hottest movie in America  calling in  Saw  Saw 4 right  yes  we're up to Saw 4  yep  isn't he supposed to be dead though  I'm a little confused  I don't know  didn't he die at the end of Saw 3  I'm thinking  flashbacks  I've never seen one  you've never seen  no I was gonna buy  a couple  first one was really really good  yeah I was gonna buy them  and  I haven't seen this one  alright 
[01:29:30]  uh Sam  it's good  he did die at the end of the third one  but he's prominently featured  in uh  as what  a flashback  well there are flashbacks  and you know  we learn more  he comes back to life  there are flashbacks  he doesn't come back to life  but we learn about  how he started  and  it's fantastic  well you do  I think you could ask him  a couple of these questions Sam  you seem to be very more informed  in all of this  you saw the film  I did see the film  yeah  Sam did his homework  alright  and uh  we got uh  and Sam show interview  yeah I think so 
[01:30:00]  we got Craig continuing to eat uh  candy  we have 46 pieces  alright get the 50  by the time we get back please  Jesus  what's taking you so long  Jesus  and then uh  we got uh  hot uh  Halloween costumes  for little girls  uh  yeah this seems to be a problem  and then Danny had to pick out  what he found hot  yeah  yeah  it's pretty funny  on the way  it's Opie and Anthony  it's Opie and Anthony  Craig is slowing way down 
[01:30:30]  how many you up to there Craig  Craig uh  decided he wanted to eat  10 pounds of candy today  going on 52  52  and an empty stomach again  so you're back in  yeah  ugh  soon to be empty again  you're doing again  good boy  still not feeling uh  still not feeling good  no  it's a rough rock phone chat  and you have to get to 100  or you don't get the money  you get nothing  you go home a loser  no  hey we gotta say hi to Tobin Bell  he's calling uh 
[01:31:00]  all the way from Japan  the star  of the Saw movies  of course  Tobin  good morning guys  Saw 4  the hottest movie in America  how does that feel  yeah  it's great  it's great  I remember sitting uh  sitting in your studio  last year  we were a long way away  from where we are today  yeah  Japan  what are you doing over there  um  well  the film opens here  in uh  in about 10 days  so we're over here  talking to the Japanese press  about it  the Japanese people like  like the movies  yeah 
[01:31:30]  they love it over here  yeah  Saw's a  Saw's a very popular  uh story  with uh  with the Japanese  so wait  it opened in America  why is there such a delay  for Japan  well  I don't  you know  I don't know  that's just how they do it  they roll these movies out  in America  and then they go to  then they just roll it out  everywhere else  and once they go other places  it gets bootlegged  yeah  there are people in offices  somewhere  making those decisions  I don't know  what the hell is  what the reasons  for it are  but I know last year  for example  the UK opened 
[01:32:00]  at the same time  as it did  in the US  so  did it make it harder  to do press  maybe that's why  because you can't be  in two places at once  maybe that's the reason  yeah  they just want to  organize it  hey  is it true that  the Japanese people  like the Saw movies  because it reminds them  of their game shows  that could easily be  that could easily be  some of the rhythms  are the same  you know  yeah  they're a bunch  of sick F's  I mean  what they find enjoyable  with those game shows  yeah 
[01:32:30]  they have a twisted  sense of humor  now Tobin  I'm a little confused  you died at the end  of Saw 3  how does this work  I'm still dead  you're still dead  and it's like  flashbacks and stuff  well  you know  the Saw story  it doesn't play out  sequentially  you know  it's like a puzzle  you know  you put a puzzle  together  you put one corner  then you put  the upper left  and then the right  and then the middle  and you know  that's the way it works  so because you know  how I died  doesn't mean you know  the rest of the story 
[01:33:00]  so  you know what  I like puzzles  until you have to  you know  like find all the blue sky  and then it's not fun anymore  the blue sky is rough  it's all about the shape  I like finding the red barn  in the woods  that's good  right  some trees are good  but then  oh god  I have to fill in the sky  with all these blue pieces  yeah  have you guys seen the movie  no not yet  actually  our own Sam saw it  and he said it sucked  no  don't you get him  in trouble  hey he's in Japan 
[01:33:30]  I'm safe  no  our own Sam saw the movie  and Sam  what did you think  I loved it  I love all the Saw movies  I see them  every time they come out  the weekend  they come out  since the first one  yeah  that's great  yeah  yeah I like that  they're moving on  because this one  like the third one  we start learning more  about who Jigsaw is  why he's doing  what he's doing  and all four  fit together  it's like a child  talking isn't it  yes  I get excited 
[01:34:00]  yeah you do  well you like Tobin  you got it Sam  you got it  I like the moving on thing  sir  I like the moving on thing  but one thing I don't like  the absence of Shawnee Smith  well you know  I miss the girl myself  but like I said  it's like a puzzle  because she's not there  at this moment  doesn't mean she's not  going to be there  in the next  oh a teaser  yeah because there's going to be  there's going to be  at least two more Saw movies  and you're signed on 
[01:34:30]  for two more right  well you know  we kind of take them  one at a time  we see how the fans  feel about four  and if they like it  and they want to see  some more  we'll be back  I see some time  in like ten years  you guys being in space  it's going to be  like you guys  Saw in space  yeah watch those  Jason movies  very closely  okay  see how that goes  don't jump the shark  on us  did they do  Jason in space  oh of course  oh yeah  Jason X was in space 
[01:35:00]  yeah  you got to end up  in space  please watch those  movies very closely  don't make the same  mistake  but you know what  it's rare for a movie  part four to be  such a massive  financial success  at the box  it is rare yeah  usually by part three  people are like  alright already  but these movies  are still really relevant  and people are digging it  well I'll tell you why  because the guys  who make them  aren't lazy  you know  they work really hard  to keep the bar up  and you know  I appreciate that  because if you're  going to do them  you want to have  a good story 
[01:35:30]  and have the quality  and you know  have these guys  they reach for excellence  if you reach for it  you might be able  to get close  hey first time  in Japan Tobin  second time  second time  yeah  what do you like  about it  or maybe you don't  like it  I don't know  well you know  I just got off  a plane about  three hours ago  and the trip in  from the airport  was about an hour  and a half  in traffic  so you know  here's what I like  about it  it reminds me  of New York  I lived in New York 
[01:36:00]  for 31 years  you come across  the bridge  there's like  a little river  you know  and then there's  all these buildings  and then you drop down  it's like the FDR  you're on this  crowded road  and you know  it's very much  like Manhattan  it's all congested  and crammed into  one place  so I like that part  of it  do they at least  fly you first class  oh yeah  always  how many hours  is a flight to Japan  11  yeah I want to go to Japan  I don't know why  but I just want to go there  yeah  they must recognize you 
[01:36:30]  on the streets  and everything right  it's been dark  really  it's been dark  since I got here  so  I'm just trying to  trying to unwind  from the trip  what is there  some kind of time difference  I think it's like  what is there  some kind of time difference  or something  there's a time difference  there's a day difference  yeah it's like Friday  there or something  yeah you go back  over the international  date line  you don't know  what the hell day it is  hey so what are you  going to do  are you going to go to bed  now and then just do  a press junker  or do you have to do  press immediately  after this 
[01:37:00]  no no  I'm going to bed  and I'll get up  in the morning  and get started  you know  talk to people  they come down  to Tokyo  from all over the country  are you going to watch  a movie and relax  before you go to bed  I'm going to take  a sauna here  in my room  there's a sauna  in your room  there's a sauna  and then the door  latches shut  and starts like  scalding you  just some kind of  wacky sauna thing  will happen to you  yeah  how ironic  and you know  when you sit on the can  it's heated  wow 
[01:37:30]  oh yeah I heard  about those toilets  yeah the Japanese  love their toilets  they have some of the  best toilets  in their hotels  I've heard about them too  but I've never  experienced them  oh you just sit down  and love it  just enjoy  I'm sitting down  right now  that's great  I can't get over  the fact that  Jigsaw has a wide stance  yeah  Tobin appreciates  the wide stance joke  little Larry Craig  mention  of course

[01:40:30]  so you got to sit there  with your mind being tortured  haven't heard anything  on the x-rays  anything on the blood tests  would they x-ray  your head  chest  your chest  yeah  they did a couple  chest x-rays  they probably mixed it up  and put it in  with the women's results  they thought you would do  for a mammogram  sorry  did Eric have a breast joke  did uh  now the stress test  they gave you  yeah  did they like  put you on the treadmill  yeah  a little bit  and did they shoot you up  with some radioactive stuff 
[01:41:00]  and then put you in a scanner  or did they just kind of  like you ran  and they took your blood pressure  that and uh  they had those little um  pads that they  glued to you  and there's like  a million uh  they look like  cat 5 cables  coming out of you  and uh  so you  you have them  taped  i guess all the way  around your heart  the other side of your chest  on your uh  yeah they're trying to figure out  how many uh  arteries you got clogged  wrists  and were you able to go  through the entire test  without uh  getting winded

[01:44:00]  just before the Auburn team  is about to take the field  cheerleaders have the banner  stretched and ready  for demolition  but wait  there's a hanging  Chad  let me get it  that one cheerleader  decides to remove  then disaster hits  she takes out a player  Ducks recover  and does her best  to avoid the stampede  of young men  and shoulder pads  coming her way  boy she must have felt  like costume  in the beginning scenes  of dancing with wolves  the young lady was okay  slightly embarrassed  she suffered a bruised jaw  but she hung in there  for the entire game  yeah  well 
[01:44:30]  what a dope  yeah  on onaradio.com  we're gonna try to start  a new thing  your video of the day  and that's your video of the day  obviously a cheerleader  in front of one of those  paper banners  and the team's about to  you know  bust through the damn thing  and she didn't get out of the way  I guess there was something  hanging on the banner  is that what I'm led to believe  and she tried to like  take it off  so she stepped in front of it  oh  yeah the guy  said that  she was getting rid of  a hanging Chad  he made a hanging Chad joke  I don't know what that is  but I know it was very funny

[01:48:30]  that I will meet  tonight  ghosts and goblins and witches  roaming the streets  in moonlight  bowls of candy  and goodies  delicious  and waiting 
[01:49:00]  in store  the sound  of cute  little footsteps  as they approach  my front door  letting the children  inside  to drink beers  razor blades  hidden in  three musketeers  screams  from the basement  of kids  begging to be set free  that's what  Halloween means 
[01:49:30]  to me  ooooh  aaaah  scary  tightening the clamps  that are holding  their little heads  so tight  putting my lips  to their ears  as I whisper  please  don't fight  I promise  I'll let you  go home  if you swear  not to tell 
[01:50:00]  a soul  well I'll just  untie these  I'm kidding  now where is  my chainsaw  let's rock  and roll  a pinch  of your brother  a teaspoon  of you  with the head  of your sister  would make  a good stew  I'd give you  a taste  but your tongue  is in the stew  irony  that's what  Halloween  means to me  no nothing 
[01:50:30]  on the irony part  nothing  alright  trick or treat  smell my feet  see irony  is an incongruity  between what's  expected  and what actually  happens  so  I can't  you can't taste it  because your tongue  is in said stew  see  I mean maybe it sends  a signal to your brain  but you can't really  trick or treat  smell my feet  damn it  give me something  good to eat  I gotta change that line 
[01:51:00]  trick or treat  smell my feet  give me someone  good to eat  Halloween  yeah  Stephen Lynch  Halloween  from his new CD  The Craig Machine  I'm changing that line  alright  we almost forgot  to do something  it's Opie and Anthony  when you have  these busy shows  you 
[01:51:30]  you know  you forget to do things  we got Craig  he's up to 60 pieces  of candy  in honor of Halloween  the bit that he came up with  he saw this  10 pounds of candy  he said he could eat  the whole bin  which is 10 pounds  he's not even  going to come close  we said look  you eat 100 pieces  we'll give you $100  and then we'll give you  a dollar for every piece  after that  but if he doesn't  make it to 100 pieces  then guess what  he gets nothing  he didn't make a dent  in that container  how many pieces  did he have to  it doesn't even look like  he had any 
[01:52:00]  I'm going on 61 right now  61 alright  there's about 200  200 more pieces  here's a little  incentive too  here's a crispy fiber  the old Abe Lincoln's  got some talking to do  the old Abe  that's right  you keep your eye on Abe  here's one of the things  we forgot to do today  we forgot to give him  the sound to listen for  tomorrow between 7 and 730  for the $1,000  what would we have done  if we had missed that  that would have been  a disaster  catastrophe  and all the sounds  that you have to listen for  are on 
[01:52:30]  onaradio.com  so if you're listening  to the show  and you're like  man I never heard the sound  that they're going to play  on the next show  for the $1,000  you can go to that website  to see what the sound  is you're listening for  it's so easy  who's got the sound  for tomorrow  you think you do  I think I can  I think I can  how about  it's the little dummy  that could  how about you  just raise your hand  when you're ready  and then we'll just  sit here awkwardly  and raise your numb hand  and make crap up 
[01:53:00]  until you're ready  hold on  what's the problem  I have the clip isolated  but I was told  there was some other stuff  being made  so that Tim was going  to take care of that  so we're waiting  alright so we're waiting  for Tim to come running  in with the sound  you need to listen for  tomorrow for the $1,000  between 7 and 7.30  hey this is just coming in  we should play this  we  I hope people understand  we try to be on top  of everything that's going on  as we're doing a live radio show  indeed  we're really trying  breaking news  while the people in the studio  are puking  I just saw the cheerleader  get trampled  god is that funny  and that's what we picked 
[01:53:30]  as your video clip of the day  and that will be up  on onaradio.com  and that's a new feature  we're going to try to pick  a video that we find hilarious  it might be like  show related  or other videos  that maybe other places  will have on their websites  whatever  and we'll put our  our choice of video of the day  up on onaradio.com  but Heather Mills  going off in England  oh was that in England  she was on Good Morning America  was that from England  that interview  yeah yeah  bitter divorce of course  with Paul McCartney  I heard that  they made her  a very generous offer 
[01:54:00]  and she wants a hell of a lot more  really  I did a lot of research  on her believe it or not  seriously  yeah I swear to god  I believe it was  60 million  or something  pounds  and she turned it down  for more  that was  again some of these rumors  are not true  but she was offered millions  just to quietly  because Paul wanted  to quietly go  he just wants to go  you know  to move on  yeah  as far as I'm concerned  she's a pig  well this is how it went down  moments ago really  Heather Mills  as we know  has been involved  in that bitter divorce battle 
[01:54:30]  with a strange husband  Paul McCartney  and taking it  from the press  in England  she went on  British television  just this morning  and let loose  they make up such lies  you know  they've called me  a whore  a gold digger  a fantasist  a liar  one legged whore  one legged gold digger  that's right  they've also called you  a flamingo  and a kangaroo  you know  Anthony went through this  this just shows  that the divorce thing  is completely out of control  here's a woman  that's going after  beetle money  this is beetle money 
[01:55:00]  beetles  the beetles  this is beetle money  a fantasist  a liar  the most unbelievably  hurtful things  and I've stayed quiet  for my daughter  but my daughter  we've had death threats  I've been close to suicide  so upset about this  I know you're  I've had  I've had worse press  than a pedophile  or a murderer  and I've done nothing  but charity  for 20 years  I can sell my story  right now  I'm trying to protect 
[01:55:30]  Paul and our daughter  I am trying  and I'm being pushed  to the edge  can I tell you something  the reason why she's not  selling her story  because there's not  enough money in it  yeah  a book from Heather Mills  would go for a couple  mil probably  that's a lot of money  for just about everyone  listening right now  but not for her  when she's got  the real money  if she just hangs in there  beetle money  she's going after  the beetle money  a book would only bring  in a couple million  this this this  wants a hell of a lot  more than that  yep  and I heard  she wants at least  a hundred million  I heard one of the 
[01:56:00]  sticking points  was that she didn't  want to sign  a non-disclosure  like that was again  some half of this  crap is not true  but that's what I heard  that she didn't  that was holding  the proceedings up  is that she wanted  and by the way  she's playing right  into the paparazzi hands  when you show weakness  like this  they're going to be  all over now  they're like  because she's now  in the news again  they're going to be  like oh god  Heather Mills  you know  a picture of Heather Mills  crying and protecting  her daughter  is going to get  a lot of money  in the next few days  just shut your trap  that voice  the one to pull  out of get out of there  oh she's awful  I'm just protecting  Paul and my children 
[01:56:30]  my daughter  those nude photos  every article I read  by the models  said she was a party girl  Adnan Khashoggi's  secretary said  she had sex with  Adnan for like  11 grand  she had threesomes  with Arab princes  and shicks  or whatever  which is fine  but she was allegedly  a high class call girl  before  old motorcycle cop  you know  took half that away  it's kind of hard  to sell yourself  one leg  unless you have  a stump fetish  well she continued 
[01:57:00]  here we go  I have been offered  nothing  okay  okay  nothing  we go to court  nothing to do with that  we go to court  over my daughter  these figures are made up  100 million  50 million  20 million  this million  how do you know  if I even want any money  look what they're doing  to the McCanns  the woman has lost  and the poor father  have lost their daughter  what did the paparazzi  do to Diana  they chased her  and they killed her  so force a change  that responsible journalism  and they will go for me 
[01:57:30]  tomorrow  and they'll go  she's crazy  and she's this  and she's that  go for it  because I will do  even more  so police came to me  to tell me  I had death threats  and that I had to be careful  that means my daughter's life  is at risk  because she's with me  all the time  and that's why  I consider killing myself  because I thought  if I'm dead  she's safe  and she can be  with her father  and that is the truth  that's the truth  I'm sick of it  jeez  what should you do 
[01:58:00]  with the daughter  give the daughter  anyway to Paul then  if you're so concerned  slob  give the daughter up  anyway  yeah give  the daughter would be  safer with Paul right now  until this whole thing  you know  gets figured out  good way to get custody too  get on TV  and talk crazy  and if you want to  by the way  talk about  how things  something needs to be changed  how about the divorce law  like how about this  piglet  you get what you  you contributed  so how about that  you receive one leg open  and one just kind of  waving in the breeze 
[01:58:30]  doing god knows what  look at the beetle catalog  see how many things say  John Lennon and Heather Mills  as far as the writing credit goes  and then divvy it up  and then that  you're entitled to  yeah  so is Paul McCartney on there  maybe not so much  look I understand  you can't just throw a woman  out on the street  I understand  you gotta do the right thing  to a certain point  but I mean  this is crazy  she had nothing to do  with the beetle  yeah  oof  she didn't  she shouldn't even  get wings money  no  she shouldn't even 
[01:59:00]  get residuals  from say say say  oh man  she shouldn't get  residuals from  the stupid one  with him  with his pursed lips  holding his lapels  yes she should  that one she should get  called memory almost full  diaper almost full  is what it should have been called  hair like an older gentleman  how about that Paul  how about getting hair  like an older gentleman  not jet black  it looks like Joan Jett  in 1981  me mullet  yes  I should be singing  crimson and clover  in this hairdo  here it is  this awfulness

[02:13:30]  at XM  satellite radio  you know I  noticed  the fans are  starting to come  around again  they're finally  realizing that  we're walking  from one studio  to another  and they're  showing up  the bleachers  starting to get  filled up  every day  now  yep  at first  there was  a few  stragglers  here and  there  that were  on top  of it  but now 
[02:14:00]  the word  is getting  out there  that we're  doing the walk  again  even though  we're not  broadcasting it  I think  we're going  to start  broadcasting  it  every Friday  for a while  oh good  for the freezing  cold weather  and then we'll  have to shut  it down  until spring  but every day  we are walking  and we're inviting  the listeners up  we had  freaking bleachers  made  so you guys  can check out  the show  and the  the bleachers  we can even  roll in here  on some day  so it's good  all I'm saying  is it's good  to see more  and more fans  realizing that 
[02:14:30]  we're getting  back to normal  and you can do  the walk over  and you can come  up and check  out the show  live  check out  the wonderful  studios  that everyone  just freaks  out over  yeah it is  really really  amazing  yeah  what is that  you can vote  for your  alright  we'll get  everyone's plugs  in no worries  and the other  thing I noticed  came in here  and there was  like 12-15  guys in here  already  I see  Laszlo is here  I see  there's some  who's that  dude  that is you  that's Danny  Daniel Lamb  he's the  no that guy  who's that 
[02:15:00]  what do you mean  what do you mean  that's you  that's your  character  on the game  that's your character  he means the real  guy that's playing it  gentleman in the studio  you're confusing the  fuck out of me  that's my friend  Bruce from Rockstar  alright Bruce from  Rockstar  he plays video games  for a living  he's playing  Manhunt 2  on the Wii  wait that's your gig  you really play  video games for a living  now there's a lot  of people out there  that want to play  video games for a living  tell them how boring  it is after a while  be honest  oh crap  hold on  unfortunately  say that again 
[02:15:30]  unfortunately  it's always always fun  it never gets boring  it doesn't get  monotonous  not at all  oh okay  and what is your job  at Rockstar  to play these games  and figure out  the bugs  and figure out  how to do things  better and all that  or  no I'm not smart  enough for all that  I just sort of  play them for people  to watch  generally  yeah see he's not  one of those guys  one of those guys  might give you  a different answer  they might say  yeah I spent like  two days  hitting the jump button  as I threw myself  against the wall  to make sure 
[02:16:00]  there was no glitches  yeah like right now  the guys that are  testing GTA 4  are playing in  12 hour shifts  so from 8am  to 8pm  and then another  crew comes in  and what do they do  in that 12 hour shift  get a motorcycle  and try to run it  through a wall  and see if you keep going  you know they're testing  every flat surface  in the game  to make sure  that your character  bounces off of it  fall halfway  through a street  and gets stuck in there  and how do they  keep track of all that  oh there's a whole  computer database system  they type in every bug  and it shows up  on all these screens  on the wall  wow 
[02:16:30]  and what's his job  his job  he's a PR  he basically  flies around the country  and just plays games  in front of people  oh fuck  of course  that never gets boring  I thought I was talking  to one of these schmucks  that has to ride  the motorcycle  for 12 straight hours  he's got the great job  oh that's nice  so you get to play  the game as like  any other gamer  would play it  a mace  pretty much  yeah  oh that's  that is cool as shit  where have you been  all over  you were just in Germany  weren't you  yeah just in Germany  so you fly  wait  out in Vegas  I thought we had 
[02:17:00]  the coolest job  in the world  so your job  is you fly to Germany  and then you play  manhunt for a few hours  in front of people  pretty much yeah  and then you go on  to another city  then we go to Vegas  then we go to San Francisco  wow  right now he's  in this level  your character is  in an S&M club  because you've woken up  in a psychiatric hospital  and of course  as we all know  when you wake up  in a psychiatric hospital  you just gotta start  killing on your way out  of course you do  so  and the third level  you're at an S&M club  which there's actually  a character  that if you hopefully 
[02:17:30]  you'll find it  I think Jimmy would like  it's got a big funnel  a leather mask  with a funnel on his face  which I'm sure  is for some kind of  yes  maybe some treats  some treats  some yellow treats  right so  that's great  this is the game  that has a lot of  controversy  yeah this game  almost didn't come out  and it's still  completely banned  in England  they will not even  deem it fit for a  rating  my word  in England  oh that was nice  some guy's just  laying on the ground  and your buddy 
[02:18:00]  just decided to hit him  with an axe  for no reason  yeah there's a lot  of different weapons  you can pick up  I mean this is  very much  if you ever  played Manhunt 1  it's Manhunt 2  sort of  you know  bows down  to the whole  horror genre  you know  and I mean  the idea  when he played  is to scare  the shit  out of you  right now  he's got  a severed head  but you can  use weapons  like crowbars  baseball bats  can you still  Bruce can you still  kill somebody  with a marital aid  I believe so  yeah at some point  you can swing 
[02:18:30]  the Wii controller  and your character  swinging a dildo  and bludgeoning  somebody  dude  that  that is sick  and this  now he's hacking  some fucking guy  that's in like  a leather  S&M shit  S&M thing  he's hacking  him apart  I didn't understand  why you hacked  that guy  that was laying  on the ground  but it was  to get his head  so he can knock  on the door  and put the head  in the people  and go  hey I'm cool  let me in  that was fantastic  wow  alright so 
[02:19:00]  he's trying to  make his way  out of the  psych ward there  well he's in  the S&M place  now there's  some guy pinned  down  on a table  with his underpants  on  I don't think  he knew this  was coming  the guy's got  a friggin saw  and there goes  well that's the  thing  you're uncovering  a plot  there's this  horrible plot  in town  the S&M club  is just a front  for you  you know  deviants come in  yeah I assume  something's going  on here  that isn't just  an S&M club 
[02:19:30]  wow  smash the light  so we can hide  oh  you can hide  in the dark  what's really cool  when you're being  chased in this game  is you can go  hide in the darkness  and they'll walk  right by  oh yeah look at him  there he goes  with the saw  he might see you  so  what do you guys  have to do  to get this  released in America  you were having  problems in America  too right  yeah  we have problems  all the way around  it's strange  how Rockstar  and the Opie  and Anthony  show seem to be  on parallel  paths of getting 
[02:20:00]  shut down  banned  thrown out  yep  but we're still  by a small group  of people  by the way  because people  there's so many  people that love  these games  and there's so many  people that love  horror movies  you know  yeah  they had to  soften a couple  of the kill scenes  that were especially  brutal  as you can see  it's still  extremely brutal  very violent  I love it  rated M for  mature  you know  it's adults  only  we're not  interested in  anybody under  17  playing it  but 
[02:20:30]  no it's  serious  trust me  I said  not Laszlo  I don't  understand why  horror movies  are fine  but the second  you put it in a  game and it  becomes interactive  which is really  a lot of fun  people have  problems with it  yeah that was a bit  gory  we're talking about  Manhunt  someone just tuned in  said what game  are you guys  talking about  Manhunt 2  it's out on the  Wii  as well as the  PSP  and the PS2 
[02:21:00]  it's a scary  violent game  but I can't get  over the fact  that it looks  ridiculous to play  with the Wii  controllers  well but it is  kind of nice  when you're  slamming a  shard of glass  in somebody's neck  to actually be  swinging the Wii  controller  yeah you're really  like working  your arms there  when he bludgeoned  someone with the  pipe  or a crowbar  he's actually  got to  swing his arms  start swinging  yeah the Wii  almost looks cool  when you're playing  Manhunt  doesn't look as  cool when you're  there he goes  when you're  bowling  when you're  bowling you look  mucho gay 
[02:21:30]  yeah  but with Manhunt  you almost look  cool look  he's kicking ass  there's a bit  of an axe battle  going on  well it's an axe  against pipe  alright pipe one  pipe one that one  so very very cool  and you got copies  of this game  for everybody  right  yep  nice  alright that'll  complete the plug  all  like that  laszlo everybody  I also brought you  a straitjacket  oh really  yeah we saw that  from an actual  psychiatric catalog  and strangely 
[02:22:00]  they're not cheap  I guess they have to  go through all sorts  of product testing  or something  but  and this would be  a great opportunity  to introduce  Twitchels to the show  where did Jimmy go  he's alright  he's doing fun  for what  here put Twitchels  in these bloody scrubs  so he looks  completely psycho  alright we got  Twitchels outside  the studio  we couldn't get him  on the first half  of the show  because we were  very very busy  here he is  Twitchels everybody  Lewis Twitchels  Santani  uh yes  what's up Twitchels 
[02:22:30]  let's put him over  there  oh  hold on  next time  alright  no one I found  maybe I shouldn't  say what I want  to say  you know  you know  whenever you say  that you should  I broke the rule  I know  I broke the  opening Anthony rule  uh there's a guy  that works in this  building and he's  a very nice guy  but he's uh  extremely  extremely disabled  that's all I'm  gonna say  that's as far as  I'm gonna go  he's extremely  disabled  and freaking  Twitchels  who's a mess  is in the elevator  with the guy  he's like  nudging me  like look  look look  jeez 
[02:23:00]  Twitchels  I never saw  anything like it  it was like  a little hand  alright  just keep it there  because I think  he's a huge fan  of the show  I wasn't making  fun of the guy  I'm just  I'm trying to  whatever  but the point is  that you have  a pretty serious  disability  but you have  no problem  looking at  someone else  that has  probably in your  eyes a worse  disability  yeah  I didn't say  it was worse  I'm sure people  look at me  and laugh at me  all the time  not that I was  laughing at the guy  you were kind of  you were  you kind of nudged me  and gave me a little 
[02:23:30]  little smile  it was one of those  laughs he tried to hide  you just wanted to  bond a little bit  I was trying to  bond with Toby  we were bonding a little bit  in the elevator  I guess  that's Tourette for  I missed you  now  it's been a while  what's this  what's awake  or awake  awake  yeah  drink plenty of that  drink some awake  and almond  do I see  almond joys  you like these  we kind of did  the chocolate bit 
[02:24:00]  already  but we also know  that for some  odd reason  Twitchels can't get  enough of almond joys  especially mixed with  awake  huh  awake and almond joys  so  uh  Laszlo got a little  info on Twitchels  right  just before  showtime Laszlo  yeah we hear tell  uh  cause Laszlo has  a straight jacket  just gotta get the  other camera up  Laszlo has a  straight jacket  uh  with Manhunt 2  on the side  yeah Manhunt 2  on the side  especially uh  but it's a real  straight jacket 
[02:24:30]  that they came from  like a straight jacket  store  that's pretty cool  that they actually  have those is  amazing  it's 2007  for fuck's sake  yeah I can't believe  that I mean these  things have been  around for 300 years  forever  it's like he's crazy  wrap his arms around  him  get the long  sleeve thing  wrap his arms around  him  yeah with the long  sleeves to tie the  knot  great  now apparently  that was um  brought to uh  Louis Twitchels  Santani's attention  and  uh  Louis Twitchels  Santani 
[02:25:00]  replied  was interesting  when he saw it  yeah yeah  like familiarity  right  and then he said  he was indeed  familiar  with a straight  jacket  uh  but he did  but he did not  want to talk  about it on the  air  which means  he basically  told Laszlo  but keep it  between you  and I  yeah  right  no no  Laszlo  immediately  knowing it  would be  uh  good radio  ran to us  and told us  I don't even  think Laszlo  waited a second  I was in a show  once  that's how much  he cares about you  I was in a show 
[02:25:30]  once where I  wore one  that's all  a show  a show  so they told you  it was a show  they told you  it was a show  is that it  and everyone  from around the land  came to see you  yeah  one of those  kind of shows  a show that also  included electroshock therapy  it was wonderful  and your cellmate  flinging feces at you  at some show  no it was one of those  Halloween type shows  they actually had it  here at  Madison Square Garden  they called it  Madison Scare Garden  yeah  it was the same  comedy  they did  I get it  so why wouldn't  you want to talk 
[02:26:00]  about that  no I didn't say  I didn't want to  talk about it  you told me  he's a compulsive liar  I don't want to  talk about it  were you in a mental  hospital be honest  say that again  mental hospital  what about it  you were in there  once  I'm not gonna say  no  I'm not gonna say  no  look I'll just say  I'm a little familiar  with these places  in my own life here  not me personally  but I'm familiar  with these places  so let's have  a little conversation  were you or were  you not in a  mental hospital  uh yes  for what 
[02:26:30]  uh it was  it was years ago  OCD  years ago  uh  it's touchy  it's  did you go crazy  not really  nervous breakdown  but if you're  having a nervous  breakdown  who can tell  he's calm  and he just says  like really smart  insightful things  right  we put him in  well you know  I was a lot  bigger  yeah you know  yeah  you were a  disgusting fat body  I was a  miserable 300 pounds 
[02:27:00]  yeah  that was my peak  yeah the video  on true life  of you  as a fat guy  was kind of creepy  and we don't know  you that way  as being fat guy  right  did you get  the stomach stapling  no I didn't  I lost all the weight  on Atkins  but my mistake  was not exercising  while I did it  that's why I have  all the loose skin  and saggy tits  the exercise  doesn't get rid of that  my friend  it just  the skin can only  stretch so much  before it's not  going to come back  right  right  that's the problem  well they said  it's dead  the actual skin's dead  yeah they said 
[02:27:30]  if it hangs  over  in my case  it hangs like  at least  two and a half  three inches  over my  over my pelvis area  your cock  over my cock  and it holds it there  and they said  because it's been  hanging for more  than a year  it won't contract back  no matter how much  I work out  go to the gym  I don't know why  that signified  working out  the girls are  horrified out there  yeah we got  penthouse pets here too  we got a very busy  show  they're very  very attractive ladies 
[02:28:00]  beautiful  but anyway  so why the mental  hospital  well  at that time  at that point in time  it's weird  I never talked  about this before  wow she looks like  a young  Anna Nicole Smith  before Anna Nicole Smith  fucked up her body  dude you get cameras  this is the first time  seeing the new studio  I love it by the way  this is high tech shit  so you were in  a mental hospital  was it a suicide attempt  I guess you could say  that I think it was  more of a cry  for attention  I don't think I really  had the intentions 
[02:28:30]  of doing it  I was  the first time  I think I was  around 14  14 years old  and  I don't know  this is the first time  I'm talking about it  it's kind of weird  what happened  it's kind of  I don't know  it's good to get to know  the Twitchell's  Louis Santani person  or Louis  Twitchell Santani  how does the person  with Tourette's  try to kill themselves  well  he just holds  a hot cup of coffee  dude 
[02:29:00]  did I tell you  that happened to me  I was at Wawa  getting a cup of coffee  and someone walked by me  who recognized me  and as I'm pouring  the coffee  yelled jump  I literally spilled  the coffee all over me  it was horrible  can we get  hot scolding water  please  I want to try  some stuff with him  so what happened  how did you try  to kill yourself  well like I said  I was heavy  really heavy at the time  that had a lot  to do with my depression  I mean  having Tourette's  is already in downfall  but being a fat kid  with Tourette's  made it worse  so I had a bunk bed  and I tied a piece of rope  around the bunk bed 
[02:29:30]  and  kind of  I was a boy scout  but not a good boy scout  so I wasn't great  with the knots  but I  didn't make a noose  but I pretty much  tied the other end  around my neck  and I'm being serious  I never talk about this  but most people  are good with knots  so you  it was a cry for help  but if you really  wanted to  kill yourself  you would have  figured out a knot  I think so  so I get to the top  of the bunk bed  I made it short enough  I  did you  blow my eyes out  sitting on there 
[02:30:00]  for at least 15 minutes  sitting on the top  of the bunk bed  with the rope  wrapped around my neck  the bunk bed  was crying too  by the way  yeah  well at that time  I was 14  but I'm fine  that's lovely  he actually brought  hot water  yeah could you  just hold that  hot water  nah  nah  wow that's  scolding too  Danny  so you're on  the top of the bunk  crying your eyes out  over 300 pounds  debating whether to do it  I think  I kind of knew  in the back of my mind  that it wouldn't work  even if I tried it 
[02:30:30]  but I just didn't  know what to do  I put my legs  over the bed  and I feel it  to make sure  it's taut  the rope  and I jump off the bed  I broke the rope  and the railing  of the bunk bed  as I went down  that's how fat I was  you were so fat  that you fucked up  killing yourself  and my mom  came into the room  and saw me lying there  on the floor  so they heard a fuck  because my room  was upstairs  please tell me  you were naked  on top of it  I was in my box  and a yellow t-shirt  I don't remember that 
[02:31:00]  but  there I am  lying on the floor  in my bedroom  with the broken pieces  of the bunk bed  lying around me  with the rope  still around my neck  and the other end  is loose now  because it broke  off the bunk bed  and my mom walks in  and we've had  these incidents before  never to that extent  but she's used to me  going ballistic  at that time  with serious depression  so she walks in the room  sees me there  sitting there  around all the  broken pieces  of the bunk bed  obviously knowing  what I tried to do 
[02:31:30]  and says  come downstairs  dinner's ready  and I went downstairs  and ate dinner  and it's weird  because that's  always been like  the way my family's been  about things like that  ashamed of you  yes absolutely  or just pretend  it doesn't exist  right  try to hide from it  you know  sweep it under the carpet  yeah let's make it go away  Sergeant G from Iraq  he's good for a few  every day  he writes  sounds like  Twitchels is fucking something  he is  the listening audience 
[02:32:00]  your ratings  so like  how does it go  to a mental hospital  situation  well  a week later  I just kept talking  about it  and they  took me  at that point  I was seeing doctors  at least once a week  and they brought it up  at the next doctor's visit  and next thing you know  I'm not leaving  the doctor's office  going home  I'm leaving  with people  going to a place  and that was  why are my things 
[02:32:30]  in front of him  who are you talking  to it about  all your friends  you can spit on them  huh  so what  you went in there  for what  depression  oh because  no so  my mom and dad  brought up  what happened  the bunk bed incident  this is later  they thought it  should be brought up  the bunk bed incident  dad  oh  and as soon as  the doctor  heard dad  he said  no question  about it  you need  you need  you need help  you need to go 
[02:33:00]  you need  he said  you stressed  the fact  that you needed  an inpatient  so it wasn't  something I could  just go  and come home  yeah  and how long  you were in the  mental hospital  eat another  almond joy  or almond  it'll make you  feel better  almond joy  that must have  been a little  traumatic  being in the  loony bin there  with Tourette's  people make  funny in there  well it was weird  because I was like  why am I here 
[02:33:30]  and I'm in there  with a place  there's one girl  that was there  had  attempted suicide  well that's what  you were in there  for  but she did it  with a gun  shot herself  in the head  and the bullet  I guess  was one of those  cases where  it didn't kill her  and the bullet  was still in her  she's talking about  this in therapy  bullet still in her  head  she killed herself  tried to kill herself  like a chocolate  on the mic  please don't ever  use that mic again  he's spitting out 
[02:34:00]  chocolate as he  discusses his  suicide  so she tried  to shoot herself  in the head  and still survive  and then I have  to tell my story  about the bunk bed  it was weird  but that's the type  of people I was  in there with  did you make up  an imaginary friend  and keep repeating  the same numbers  over and over again  and then later on  when you dug up  the big metal thing  in the ground  it was on that  big metal thing  something like that  so how many times  have you tried  to kill yourself  that's a very  deep lost reference 
[02:34:30]  of course  that was  that was pretty much it  yeah  alright  Halloween in the  metal house  these are good  Halloween in the  metal house  those are delicious  Jimmy  I normally don't eat  them but I'm in  the chocolate  how you been by the way  I'm good thank you  good  this is good to hear  oh we just lost  a guy had some info  some radio station  doing something  called the baby bird  or something  hopefully that guy  can call back  I was just about  to go  really  and we lost him  alright  and we also have  penthouse pets  outside the studio  they look very good  we got the manhunt  guy playing manhunt  from rockstar  all I see is just

[02:41:30]  with the stuff  he did with you  last time  she didn't like  you sucking the toes  Eric  no she was not  very happy with that  yeah  she's not very happy  with the  spanking  and  the assault  we like to call it  the assault  yeah  the assault  when you took  your fist  spanking  and punched her  in her asshole  yeah spanking  pretty much  what you did  spanking can be  very sexy  if it's done  the right way  you assaulted her  does this sound  like a nice  little spanking  yeah  he cannot 
[02:42:00]  stop staring  at that blackberry  oh he is  he is losing  his mind  huh  yeah what's it say  no it wasn't  her either  it was Tom Carvel  you have to admit  Justine is a very  beautiful woman  you can't say  she's not beautiful  she's very nice  no she's beautiful  you can't  even if you  you guys had a weird  moment  you have to admit  he's not allowed  to look at her  it's so obvious  but you have to  I don't want him  to get in too much  trouble  would you go  would you go  skiing with her  ew  I want a place  to live later  hey Justine  I'm like no

[02:43:30]  what was the  complication  see I thought  you got engaged  just to make  things right  no no  that's a joke  no better reason  to get engaged  I love your  feeling  hey I got  in trouble  for spanking  somebody on  this show  so  oh boy  was that  fucking not  good  you also got  in trouble  for chapter  two through  twelve  that was all  before I  knew her  I did that  while I was  dating  what did you  spank her  with  no she's  like  how is that  acceptable 
[02:44:00]  in a relationship  so you're  not the only  one  well at least  she made  a very good  argument  though  Eroch  the talking  to what  was that  about  please  justine  can you  take off  your  please  while Eroch  talks  please  yes I can  fantastic  Eroch  the talking  to involved  how displeased  she was  with it  and the fact  that most  of her family  heard everything  on the radio  but don't they  they do understand  that it's  the show  boy  some of them 
[02:44:30]  especially like  her mom  her aunts  never heard  the show  before  and had just  pretty much  started listening  that day  no  about a couple  days before  that  and to hear  that  we have a little  lighting issue  you're gonna have  to move a little  closer to Eroch  no no  Eroch  you're in the  good light  it is a  lighting  just stay  right  would you stay  in one spot  stay right there  every time  that's it  it's just a  lighting issue  it's gotta be said  for the radio  people  every time  justine  takes a step 
[02:45:00]  toward Eroch  Eroch  it's like  they're two  magnets  Eroch  moves  he's backing  up on that  foot  every time  I get closer  he treats  pussy like  kryptonite  I hope you  don't treat  your girlfriend  this way  see that's  much better  now we got  a nice  lighting  thing there  that was  the problem  so Eroch  continue  look at her  legs  how can you  not look  how can you  not think  that those  are fantastic  feminine legs  Eroch  I'm starting to  think you might  be gay  no  he's not even  looking by the way  he won't even  look down  it's window 
[02:45:30]  shopping  I mean  every man  window  it's window  shopping  are you  allowed to  look  you're not  even allowed  to look  you're in  the middle  of the story  you said her  family started  listening  her family  started listening  and made a  nice family  gathering  discussion  we're all out  to dinner  the whole family  had to talk  about you  punching her  in her  asshole  yeah  really the  whole family  yeah well  it was pretty  much avoided  most of the 
[02:46:00]  dinner  and you  could just  sense that  people were  just dancing  around it  until  somebody decided  to voice  what it was  and said  hey I saw  the video  so  they saw  her fiance  sucking blue  cheese  off the toes  of Justine  no  they saw  the spanking  did the  conversation  come up  after Justine  Jolie left  and you told  us how hot  she was  and how you  wanted to get  with her  I did not  do that 
[02:46:30]  of course  he did  I'm like  of course  he didn't  no he did  you are  I love my  girlfriend  so I set her  on fire  for her  so then  can I just  make out  you can watch  so you guys  actually started  talking about it  at dinner  the video  and everything  that came a  little later  that weekend  right after it  was just pretty  much a lot  of tension  a lot of  not being  talked to  and then  the show  had to go  down to  DC  to broadcast 
[02:47:00]  and  it just  it was a  whole mess  wow  it really  got bad  dude  damn  it lasted  at least  a week  week and  a half  alright  and then  the conversation  was like  I don't want  you in the  studio with her  again  I don't want  you talking  to her  I don't want  you touching  her right  how did it  go  that was  that was  the tame  part of it  yeah  that if  she found  out she was  here again  she was  going to  come over  and knock  her out  oh  damn  nice  why would

We thought she was going to come in here and kick her ass.  I was like, I hope she doesn't storm into the door and no one can grab her.  Remember the security guard, though?  I don't think he would have let her up.  Master Paul would have sure he knows her.  Oh, okay.  Hey, are you guys competing for Pet of the Year, too?  Yes.  Are you really?

It's people voting by text message.  It's, you know, Mark Beltz, the owners.  It's literally everyone's opinion.  Okay.  And then he just kind of...

You're not the final four.  It's like...  No.  All right, all right, all right.  Okay, okay.  I have to fuck that.  Yeah, I was going to say, we're still rotating.  This is actually just the first five that they've decided to take for now, and then after  that, you know...  Do you guys want to meet the penthouse pet of 1935?  Yes.  Sandy Cain, everybody.  Come on in.  Penthouse pet from 1935.  This is what you ladies have to look forward to. 
[03:03:00]  That's right.  Oh, God.  When the looks go away.  She was in Pent Barn.  Wow, guys.  There you go.  That's...  Hey, at least I have double-D titties in the real.  Yeah.  In the real.  Hey, ladies, isn't that time a bitch?  Yeah.  Aw.  Yeah, there's your...  Aw.  They're just saying, aw.  Yeah, I like your stocking.  I get this.  Hey, you want to light up your tits finally for the ladies?  Definitely.  I have my pump in.  Hey, what are you...  Microphone.  She has a dildo in her hand.  What do you have a dildo for?  It was just in the toilet. 
[03:03:30]  She needs it.  That was in her toilet.  Nice.  Nice.  A vampire dildo?  Huh?  Is it a vampire dildo?  It's a black one because it doesn't show the dirt.  We need another mic.  Oh.  That's going to be funny, right?  Hello.  Hallelujah.  All right.  There you go.  Hey, Justine, what are your girls going to do?  We got tricks over here.  What do you bring to the table?  The stripper pole.  All right.  Very good.  Nakedness.  Nice.  Well, you know, it's a tough story.  What else do you need?  What else do you need?  I'm like, that thing is...  That thing is...  That thing is so scary.  You don't leave me just like a dick. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  Listen.  I'm just saying.  All right.  No, you can say anything you want over here.  It's the other side.  He turned himself on by himself.  Yeah, I know.  That was in the toilet.  Why did you use her a dildo in 1935?  Why did you dig the dildo out of the toilet?  Yeah, because it's freaking me out, man.  I like it better.  It's toilet water.  Wait, what's wrong, Justine?  The face on it is...  On the dildo?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you meant on Sandy.  I'm now officially terrified.  You don't still need one.  Maybe I do.  She's dressed today as the woman that got out of the tub in The Shining dressed like a 
[03:04:30]  bug.  You bugged me, buddy.  Yeah, you bugged me.  All right, Sandy.  Do your trick.  Sandy Kane, everybody, with the...  Okay.  Oh, you didn't show the girls.  See, the girls thing that they have.  Oh, girls, you want to see what could happen to your vagina if you let the one guy have sex  with you?  Well, you...  I don't know.  I'm not sure they want to, but I think they should.  Yes.  Yes.  Let's see.  Please.  All right, Justine.  Sandy, go show them your genital wart.  That you claim is something else.  Hold on. 
[03:05:00]  Are we going to decooter here?  Yes.  We like to call this twaddo.  Twaddo.  Twaddo.  It's cute.  That's a good one.  She swears...  She swears...  Here's the guy who shaved my pussy.  I was working at a club called Las Vegas Bar, which was totally naked, but the rent was  due, and I, you know...  So, and I shaved because I didn't want to have a hairy pussy, and this is what happens.  This is really what happens.  Squirming.  That became that.  Okay. 
[03:05:30]  It's a genital wart.  No, it's not.  It is, and that's what they say, but it really...  Is that not, like, a huge skin tag?  No, it's a wart.  Skin tag.  Skin tag.  It's a size of an ear.  It's not been an easy life.  What do you girls think?  Can't you cut it off?  Well, like surgery?  I didn't have it seared off.  What, her head?  I mean, I'm glad I left it on, because Opie and Anthony really get a kick out of it.  It's all over their websites, though.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, I say if you can't have the best of everything, do the best with everything  you have.  Yeah, right.  So, because you shaved, did that happen? 
[03:06:00]  And when I was in a peep show, I actually got more tips.  Yeah, because of that.  Because I had a hemorrhoid.  All right, Sandy Kane.  Sandy Kane.  Now, show them...  Oh, the roid.  You didn't show the roid.  Yeah, show them your dried-up asshole.  Please.  Now, get over there.  Get over under the light.  Don't touch them.  Let the girls decide if it's a nice ass or not.  Back of Sam's.  The reason I have a great ass is because I have a hemorrhoid and a hemorrhoid.  Open it.  Open your ass.  Sandy, hold the mic so she can open the ass for the young penthouse pet.  I'm like, sorry, I got to look.  All right, here we go.  Oh, what a reaction to that one. 
[03:06:30]  All in unison.  Oh, man, fuck me, my asshole, because I had a hemorrhoid.  The girls are not...  I'll say this one.  They're not squeamish.  Yeah, these girls, we can't shake them.  I don't know why.  I did wipe.  I did wipe.  Yeah, not much toxins, I don't think.  That's good.  Great girls.  Great reaction.  All right.  You're going to light up your tits there, Sandy Kane?  Let me suck your cock for Halloween.  Sure.  Are you going to sing, let me suck your cock for Halloween? 
[03:07:00]  Will anybody be naked?  I'm going to masturbate to that stripper pole.  All right, you can do that, too.  When are the hot girls going to get naked?  Who would like that?  You want me to light my titties up?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Light your titties up.  Yeah, and while you do that, Bruce, if you could beat her over the head with the wee  moat.  The wee moat.  That was the O.B. and Anthony show.  Do we have any wee gasoline we could dump on her when she lights her titties on fire?  And the fucking wee is right in front of my view.  First thing, I want to wish everyone a happy Halloween, and if there's anyone's birthday... 
[03:07:30]  Well, she really is going to light them on fire, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  She's got to paste it on her.  Yeah, what do you got for us?  You got nothing.  Holy crap.  You got nothing.  How did you stick that on there?  Oh, Jesus.  Because I have inverted nipples.  Going on over there.  Oh, okay.  Oh, gorgeous.  Look at the...  Oh, my God.  They're lovely girls.  You did say something about nakedness.  I wish I could meet the right man to get my nipples out.  The right man.  They're in there.  They are in there.  All right, now she's lighting up her boobs. 
[03:08:00]  Anyone want to light them up?  No, just you do it.  Any kind of intern here, want to have a fight with their girlfriend?  Go for it.  All right, everybody.  Happy Halloween.  Happy Halloween.  Happy Halloween.  She has giant wood matches in her inverted nipples sticking out.  Please let the wig go.  And she's got pumpkin pasties, and now her boobies are on fire.  What do you think, girls?  Nothing?  No, that's a good talent. 
[03:08:30]  That's definitely a fabulous party trick.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  God, these girls.  About to burn your nipple.  Uh-oh.  She likes it.  She's going to start on fire.  Wouldn't that be a shame?  It came off with close, love.  Oh, my God.  Oh, ah.  Oh, ah.  Oh, ah.  Close.  I don't believe it felt good.  Close call.  That was a very close call.  Not gross.  What do you got?  Justine, what does your crew have?  Beautiful breasts. 
[03:09:00]  They're all good.  You want us to make out?  If you're all good.  Yeah, I'm making out.  Would you like the best girl to get up and give us a lovely lap dance?  Any implants over there?  Just one.  Me?  Oh, I'm the only one this time.  Oh, yeah.  Your breasts are natural?  No.  Mine?  Yes.  Yeah.  These are mine.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  Sorry, my hands are cold.  They're like, not that all the girls aren't lovely, but those are, they're almost enough 
[03:09:30]  to make me emotional.  Don't cry.  I can't take more crying.  They are like the perfect, heavy, teardrop breasts.  And you have no idea how firm these bad boys are, too.  I'd love to know.  They're awesome.  Describe how firm your boobs are.  I can't believe those are real.  They're pretty great.  They're heavy.  They drop.  Teardrops.  They are heavy.  What?  Heavy, firm, full.  Ooh, and they're warm. 
[03:10:00]  God damn it.  They are really warm right now.  Oh, are they?  Oh, they got nippley.  Look.  Finally.  Oh, they got nippley.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Get it back.  It doesn't ever get like that.  Me and ice cubes.  Okay.  Wow.  Anyway.  Here's your nippley.  Try not to think, Sandy Kane.  Robin Birdies and stuff nipples.  She would love these girls.  What?  Remember Robin Bird? 
[03:10:30]  No.  Oh, fuck Robin Bird.  You know Robin Bird?  Big, fat pig.  I saw her recently in the park.  She's a big, fat mess.  Yeah, but she used to be really hot.  And now she reads books.  Who gives a shit about Robin Bird?  And now she used to stuff nipples on her show, so she would love those girls.  Those are real?  Any other references from 1979 while you're at it?  Okay.  She was a bisexual.  Yeah.  Someone had a bias on them.  Gotcha.  So what's going on over there, Justine?  Oh, my God.  We're trying to get her nipples as hard as possible.  They really are.  Yeah, that's really what they're doing. 
[03:11:00]  They're just all tweaking each other's nipples.  That's the task right now.  That's a fun little area of the studio, that is.  Yeah, we wanted to do boobalander, but we only have one girl with implants, so.  Those are so lovely.  Thank you.  Yeah, what do you do with...  I like your areolas.  You have large areolas.  Yeah.  These are very sexy.  I don't know.  It's...  That was wonderful.  These are my tatas.  Hello, girls.  Beautiful.  Filling up.  They're speechless because we're naked.  Nice.  I don't know.  I don't need...  I give up on the camera.  I don't even know who to zoom in on anymore. 
[03:11:30]  No one's going to get in trouble, right?  No.  I don't want any girlfriend coming to my ass or anything like that.  Screw it.  No, not now.  That'll be later.  Hey, how come you guys don't go bottomless?  We're going topless.  I would like...  Yeah, you guys, take something off.  What about some dick around here?  Take some dick.  Oh, my God.  You're here.  All right.  What about some dick around here?  All right.  Bring a pat-duffy.  Yeah, give some dick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bring a pat-duffy.  He wants some dick in. 
[03:12:00]  You never know how big a man is.  His name is Pat fucking Duffy, all right?  Okay.  Pat, you want to get naked for the girls?  Oh, yes.  Come on.  Why not?  He's wearing my favorite shirt.  Come on, baby.  Get sandie canes.  Huh?  What happened, Pat?  Finally, we found something you don't want to do.  You don't have to do anything.  Why wouldn't you get naked?  What am I doing?  Just get naked for the hot girls.  Get naked for the penthouse tent.  I'm just standing here?  Yeah, just standing here.  No, you have to come over here so we can see you.  Yeah, come over here.  Give us a little show.  Pat, stand in front of the girls. 
[03:12:30]  We don't need to see you.  And drop your pants for the girls.  Oh, yeah.  Go on the pole.  Yes, baby.  Holy strawberry.  Pat's like, what?  I'm just very confused.  Not on the camera.  This is all you have to do.  You just face the girls on the couch.  Right here.  And just drop your pants.  I say in front of everybody.  I don't need to see you.  Yeah, we don't have to look, but I want to see.  Justine.  I'm sure it's going to be small and embarrassing.  Okay, hold on.  Yeah, you want to work it a little bit?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  My girlfriend's going to be pissed now.  She's on her knees. 
[03:13:00]  She's buckling his pants.  Wait, I want to get to Rihanna, your head girl.  No more girlfriend trouble, dude.  Yeah, Justine has backed off.  She's like, I'm done.  She doesn't want any more girlfriend trouble.  I hate my girlfriend.  I would have girlfriend trouble.  Jimmy.  We already saw the last one.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  He's like, no.  What about just your shirt off, then?  No, take the pants off.  You're not going to do anything.  Just pull them down really quick.  Why, just show your cock.  What's wrong with you?  All right, call your girlfriend.  You ate shit. 
[03:13:30]  Quick flash.  Quick flash.  Call your girlfriend.  It's not even anywhere near ready.  Pull it down a little bit.  You don't care.  Here's what the problem is.  No, we just wanted to see the boxers.  He's hiding, honey.  He doesn't care about it.  Sandy, shut up.  He doesn't care about his girlfriend.  He knows it right now.  He's fucking packing like a half-in.  Who cares?  They don't care.  They know.  It's scary.  All right.  All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  That was ballsy. 
[03:14:00]  I'm so glad.  That was ballsy.  Wait, the one girl said, oh my God.  Why did you say, oh my God?  Because he actually did it.  I didn't think he was going to.  It was just like a dick, only smaller.  Were you impressed?  Was it big?  I didn't see it.  Show her.  You got to show Sandy.  Like a thumb.  Sandy's the one that hasn't seen cock in a while.  I'll show you.  Thank you.  I used to know.  Go over there.  Go over there.  I was like, you know.  Her fucking costume is so awful. 
[03:14:30]  You know, it's just amazing.  I wish people could understand how awful her fucking costume is.  Oh my God.  Just a little.  Just a little bit.  Men have balloon tics.  Sometimes we get real tics.  When she's talking, Mike, her.  Sorry.  Yeah, but he's too.  Some men do have.  I am like a.  I just thought I worked in Pete's show.  So I know every dick and everything.  And some men have balloon dicks.  Yes.  When you walk in the room, they pop.  Nothing.  No, I met a man on 42nd Street and 8th Avenue.  He said, Sandy, remember me? 
[03:15:00]  I had you in the peep show and you were really great.  Oh, that's something.  What a show you put on.  Bring home to mom and dad.  Because I urinated in a cup and he loved that.  Yeah, great.  That was great.  Ladies, what did you think of Pat?  Is he packing?  I'm impressed.  Is that Nelson Rockefeller?  Yeah, and it was shaved at night.  I know.  You're clean cut.  Good job.  Pretty recently, too.  Yeah, good.  You can tell.  Last night.  Yeah, your girlfriend's really lucky, man.  Well, thank you.  It's a good thing that you keep it shaved for.  Thank you.  I prematurely ejaculate a lot.  Do you really?  Do you really? 
[03:15:30]  Do you?  She's really not lucky at all.  You do a little premature?  Yeah, I get too excited.  I'm just like, I'm having sex.  No, it's not a fuck.  Yeah, but then after that, you can do it.  Yeah, we're on two and three.  Yeah, the second time is usually good.  Okay.  It's usually.  So what?  You get the first one out of the way so you can really get into it?  Yeah, I'm like, hey, let's relax for a minute.  Let's just take a break and come back to it.  I'm having sex.  Oh, fuck.  Do you at least go down on it?  Do you go down bus diving while you're waiting for it to come back?  I never have it yet with her. 
[03:16:00]  With her.  With her, I haven't.  How long have you known her, Jay?  No, we've been together like five months or so.  And you haven't gone down on it yet?  No, I just haven't.  Wait, we gave you that homework assignment.  You're right.  We're actually shocked right now.  Hold on.  Hold on.  She had a bloody birth canal for a little while.  And then I just haven't had the chance.  For four months?  Yeah, Jesus.  I just haven't had the chance.  A four-month-long period?  He's selfish.  He's not a four-month-long miscarriage.  Yeah, there you go.  I don't know if he's selfish.  No, no, I don't know if he's selfish.  I think that Pat cannot eat pussy. 
[03:16:30]  And I think the fact that he tries to, and a girl is like, ugh, I'm going to lose all respect for you.  I think that he tries, but he's awful at it.  So he's orally challenged.  Watch some porn.  And I discourage him.  Okay.  He doesn't know what he's doing.  It's that Amish beard.  He gets shit in it.  It's so long.  Ladies.  Hold on.  We've got some ladies in the studio.  Give him some advice on eating the puss.  That he could take home to his woman.  That's good.  Not from you.  Just start.  Yeah, just start.  I'm doing it.  So that's it?  But no, you know how the socks are in.  Step one.  Some guys go nuts and they just do it real quick the whole time. 
[03:17:00]  I like quick and slow.  I like both.  You know how some guys get real excited and they're like, bleh.  I like, bleh.  Really quick and slow.  Quick and slow.  I think you should start out slow, soft, kissing, you know, around the outer labia.  And then work your way into the inner labia.  Because if you go right for the clit, goddammit, she's going to kick your ass.  I hope.  Because I know I will.  There you go.  You hope.  And it's all about the tongue.  Oh, God.  She's got to chime in.  It's all about the tongue.  No, you know, a man, certain men have great tongues.  You have to develop your tongue. 
[03:17:30]  I mean, people talk about the dick, but develop the tongue, too, hon.  And every man has a good tongue.  You know, you have to work at it.  You know, get that on her.  I remember during the Eisenhower administration.  Yeah.  Oh, that's fucking shooting.  I'd say, you know who could eat pussy?  Lucky Lindy.  I remember that Lind book, baby.  Do you have a molded?  What happened?  No, go to Penthouse.  I used to have one of those.  You did?  I used to put it between the mattress.  There you go. 
[03:18:00]  It was a good time.  What?  You used to fuck a pocket pussy?  I used to have one of those long ones.  That's what I call it.  Hey, ladies, can Pat Duffy show his technique on something?  And you guys can give him a little advice?  What did we use last time?  A blow-up doll?  Yeah, we had a blow-up doll.  Yep.  What do we got?  We got anything laying around there?  I can show you over panties.  What?  Over panties.  This girl's hot.  Is that all hot?  A pumpkin? 
[03:18:30]  Sandy Kane is wishing she had a time machine.  Oh, please.  So late.  So are you what?  Wishing she had a time machine.  Yeah.  Give it.  Dildo, man.  Don't get tough.  Hey.  All right.  Leave Dildo alone, please.  Hang over.  Justine, what are you suggesting?  Over there?  I said I can show you how to eat pussy over panties.  All right.  How's that accomplished?  Over panties.  Over her panties.  So who's going to...  Over...  Yeah.  Who's going to take off their pants?  Oh.  Who's doing it? 
[03:19:00]  Okay.  Yeah, I'm going down.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Clear that couch.  I haven't shaved.  Clear that couch.  I haven't shaved in like three days.  All right.  Pat, this is for you.  Get over there.  I'm just going to show you how to eat pussy.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy is stroking his penis.  Get Sandy Kane out of the way.  Sandy Kane's got to get out of the way.  No.  Go.  Holy shit.  Wait, let me see.  I want to see this myself.  Wait, why will you do it only through panties?  Oh, my God.  Get your fucking head out of the way.  Holy shit. 
[03:19:30]  It's Jim Norton's fucking back.  Oh, sorry.  Get out of the way, you...  Just...  All right.  We're getting it on pal talk there.  Herp.  She has a fucking big bulge, man.  Should I?  Yeah.  Well, first...  She's licking it up and down.  Now she's kind of sucking on it.  Oh, my God.  Now I'm grinding my fucking pussy in her face.  You look like you have very, uh...  Very, uh...

And now her toes in her pussy.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Is there a way to explain?  She's got eye contact.  Uh-huh.  That's a good thing, too, guys.

And now they need a room.  Her pussy did taste good, though.  It did.  It was yummy.  It was good.  I wouldn't care if it tasted, like, hot pot water.  It does.  Yeah.  It was fabulous.  Pat, you learned anything out there?  It was wonderful. 
[03:24:30]  That's wonderful.  Pat, what'd you learn?  Thank you for not knowing how to lick pussy, because that was great.  Oh, my God.  Pat, what'd you learn?  Apparently, that's all I have to do.  Yes, that is all you have to do.  It's easy.  Right?  There you go.  That was so sexy.  That was awesome.  Now they're all wet.  Now, Pat, you want to show them what you're packing?  Nothing.  Nothing's going on.  Too many people in here.  That's fucking awesome.  I think I'm hiding again.  Yeah, I think it's even more regressed than it was.  I love it. 
[03:25:00]  Did anyone get hard on watching that?  I filled up before.  I filled up before.  But I was just too enthralled watching.  So you had great morning sex this morning?  No, no.  I don't ever fuck in the morning.  I can't do it.  I hate morning sex, because everybody's breath stinks.  I cannot fuck in the morning.  Brush your teeth.  No, no.  But even that, you still have to go about your day a little bit.  And once I come, my energy's gone.  Right.  So I just want to collapse back on her if I have sex in the morning.  I'm glad I'm not the only one.  I hate morning sex.  Do you like sex? 
[03:25:30]  I know.  I'm sorry, what?  We're horny.  Yeah, we're horny.  Well, someone else...  I want to go home.  There's plenty of time.  Yeah, there's a dildo around here somewhere.  Right there.  I fucked a dildo.  You don't want to use that one.  It's a dirty-faced dildo.  Yeah, I'm actually really terrifying.  Yeah, you get a staph infection.  By the way, we usually get nothing out of girls that come in like this.  These girls are amazing.  They've actually come to the table.  I'm trying to find out where they are, but I think so.  I got a...  Here, here's a banana. 
[03:26:00]  Ew, you're a banana.  Dildo was in a toilet an hour ago.  The face is wigging me out, man.  Huh?  I washed them.  Are you going to sing...  Let me sing a song.  You want to hear a song for Halloween?  Yeah, let me suck your cock.  All right.  Hey, you know, I'll tell you one thing about my life.  Yeah.  I have never, ever, what these girls just did, ever, and I never could.  Been sexy? 
[03:26:30]  No, no.  Ain't a pussy.  I like my own.  You want your pussy?  No, not by a woman.  So I just got to...  Maybe I'm a homophobe.  But anyway, but it was really erotic.  And I've worked with people that do that, with girls, but I have never, ever seen anything  so sexy and erotic.  But I could never do it.  It reminded me during the Bay of Pigs.  Because I don't like other women's pussy.  I just like my own. 
[03:27:00]  Wow.  And I love dicks, so, you know, it's it.  It's the opposite of everybody in the world.  Yeah, give me a dick.  I love dick.  Yeah.  Give me a fucking dick, man.  Anything.  Oh, my God.  So that's my opinion.  Okay.  But that's why I want to sing Let Me Suck Your Cock for all the guys out there.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm just going to sing something?  You know, for Halloween.  All right, we can put it on.  Get under the speakers over there and sing.  Can I do it right?  Because I...  Yep.  Do it under the light.  I'm not wearing underwear, not purposely.  No one cares.
