<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a bizarre, repetitive chant about a "black lady" cramping, followed by repeated exclamations of "Blame, Blame, Blame."  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, then discussed their Christmas gifts from Farid (three large boxes of wine), Anthony's resulting hangover after only two glasses, and his subsequent parking woes in the city, encountering many drunk individuals.  They admitted to being unprepared for the show due to the holidays and hangovers, planning to rely on listener calls and old bits.

Devin Ratray (Buzz from *Home Alone*), a heavily intoxicated caller, joined the show, boasting about his drinking, acting career, and crudely commenting on Macaulay Culkin and Michael Jackson, claiming to possess an exclusive videotape of them together. He also discussed his father's adult film career in the 1970s and *Young Lady Chatterley*.  A listener won front-row Donna Summer tickets and a Las Vegas trip in a contest. An offensive Christmas song, "Herky Jerky Christmas," about Ben Sparks was played.  The hosts reviewed sexually suggestive listener reviews of a sex book, hampered by printer issues. They also mentioned Bernie Goetz's upcoming appearance and a listener sighting of "O&A" and "WOW" on a Florida water tower. The segment ended with a Nine Inch Nails/Marvin Gaye mashup.

Technical difficulties marked the beginning of the next segment, leading to playing the wrong audio and insults directed at producer Ben.  A caller, Rachel, expressed discomfort with the hosts' coverage of the Lacey and Connor case, prompting their defense.  They then played a sexually suggestive sexual harassment training video and a profane parody of "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer."  A potato-obsessed man's story led into XM Radio ads.  A subsequent caller unleashed a torrent of offensive and homophobic slurs at a customer service representative. The discussion shifted to embarrassing male experiences, like buying condoms.  Jim Norton recounted a vulgar story about kissing a transsexual porn star with Mike Tyson at a porn awards show, implying further sexual activity.  A listener criticized Norton's gay-themed discussions, sparking a conversation amongst callers about identifying transgender individuals in photos, filled with offensive language.  A New Hampshire police officer called in with an anecdote about a post-operative transgender individual.  Bernie Goetz then joined the show.  He discussed his case, legal battles, and his views on New York City politics, including Hillary Clinton and Al D'Amato.

A lengthy interview with Bernie Goetz followed, covering his 1984 subway shooting.  He criticized NYC politicians, detailed the shooting, justifying his actions, and discussed the legal repercussions.  He shared his views on vegetarianism, drug legalization, Michael Moore, and other public figures.  The interview was punctuated by offensive songs, prompting Goetz to request they be turned down.  Keenan Thompson called in briefly to discuss the *Fat Albert* movie.

The next segment featured a continued interview with Bernie Goetz, focusing on his escape, "subway vigilante" status, pet squirrels, his website "bernieformayor.com," and public perception.  Keenan Thompson, promoting the *Fat Albert* movie, called in again. Goetz made an offhand comment about shooting subway beggars.  Offensive "F.U." messages from listeners were played.  After commercials (including an ACC basketball recap and ski report), the interview with Goetz continued in studio, with photos being taken.  The conversation covered race relations, crime, AIDS’ impact on crime, his personal life, sex, and vegetarianism. A listener made a sexually suggestive comment about Goetz's erectile dysfunction.  The show also promoted a Jim Florentine and Club Soda Kenny HBO segment, discussed an offensive comment by a merchandise seller, and featured a call with a *Fat Albert* actress.  The hosts expressed their desire to end the show amidst more offensive commentary and calls.

Finally, an interview with Dania Ramirez, promoting *Fat Albert*, followed.  The hosts speculated about the film's R rating and discussed her past roles, including a lesbian character in *She Hates Me* (kissing Kerry Washington) and a potential *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* role.  They also discussed her earlier work and a comedian’s Rosie Perez impression.  A "What did we learn?" segment featuring vulgar listener comments, many praising Bernie Goetz, followed. The show ended with break-up lines, a comparison of the 1970s and present, and further vulgar and sexually suggestive remarks.

[00:07:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, good morning. 
[00:09:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Hello.  How are you?  All right, I gather.  Yeah, you don't look good, Anthony.  Oh, so...  I gotta tell you, you don't look good.  I'm a little tired this morning. 
[00:10:00]  Why are you tired?  Thank you.  Remember our Christmas present we got from Farid?  Yeah, it was...  15 pounds of wine.  It was at least 20 to 25 pounds of wine.  Yeah.  How many bottles did he give us?  Like six to eight?  Something like that?  Yeah.  Most people, when they give a Christmas gift that involves alcohol, it's like one bottle.  Here you go.  Nice bottle of wine.  Here.  Nice bottle of champagne.  If you're gonna give a Christmas gift, unless you're in the person's house, keep it something 
[00:10:30]  they could fit in their pocket.  Because if you have to walk with it any distance, you don't want to be toting pounds of gift with you.  Yeah, that happened last Friday.  We did the top secret meeting with our old boss, Farid, who now runs Citadel Broadcasting.  And as we're leaving, he decides to plunk down three massively heavy boxes for you, myself,  and Jimmy Norton.  It made a thud sound on the conference room table when they put it down.  It should not thud.  I guess it was like a case of wine for each of us. 
[00:11:00]  A case of wine.  So, mine's been just kind of sitting in my apartment, but it looks like you partook in  your wine last night, Anthony?  Yeah, I had a total of two glasses of the Farid wine, and I feel like crap.  I feel so hungover from two glasses of wine.  What a pussy.  Dude, you used to laugh at two glasses of wine.  Two glasses of wine.  You used to laugh like, ha-ha. 
[00:11:30]  Ah, I do that when I wake up in the morning before I have my coffee.  You know what I would do with a bottle of wine in the old days?  I'd put my foot up on it like the Captain Morgan ads as I just wolf down Captain Morgan.  Oh, you know, I still, you know, drink beer.  I like the, you know, the beer and stuff.  But two glasses of wine.  Oh, what a head on me I had this morning, Ralph.  You know what took care of me?  Huh?  Found it in a fridge?  Ice cold grape juice. 
[00:12:00]  That's what I need.  Ice cold grape juice.  We were drinking the grape juice the night before.  Clear the field, some men are going to do some drinking.  Clear the field.  Oh.  You got pitch pipe.  You got pitch pipe.  So you're now a lightweight?  I'm a lightweight.  I think I've always been a wine lightweight, though.  I don't drink it.  Do not drink wine ever, ever.  And then last night I have two glasses and I wake up this morning like, oh my God. 
[00:12:30]  I have the headache, the hangover, the whole deal.  The whole deal.  You were saying in the office before the show that you were getting bed spins?  Yeah.  Aren't you too old for bed spins?  Yes.  I go to sleep, you know, at the ungodly hour of 830.  Bed spins are for the young.  Yeah.  Another thing for the young.  For the young, the bed spins.  Butt sex for the young.  Bed spins for the young.  Butt sex and bed spins.  Oh, yeah.  And I felt like I was getting the bed spins. 
[00:13:00]  It's like, oh my God.  If I vomit, I'm really going to be pissed at myself.  But I didn't.  I, you know, went to sleep and woke up.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You would have felt better if you did that last night or this morning.  Fareed's wine.  Well, Fareed's wine, it looks like it's pretty potent because I'm surprised that two glasses 
[00:13:30]  would do you in.  I know.  Unless you had huge glasses of wine.  Hey, Ant.  Nice wine.  Oh, had some nice wine, did you, Ant?  Have any half-naked friends in their pajamas over, too?  And how did the Java log work out?  Oh, no Java log.  Oh, God.  Give me a break.  Oh.  I don't know what's going on, though.  You know, when I was getting my car to drive 15 blocks to put it in a garage for $20. 
[00:14:00]  What a nightmare.  Why did you drive?  Well, I got my car in the city these days and, you know.  Which is impossible to deal with.  Well, it really is.  And, you know, I don't throw it in a garage because it's not in the city enough, you know,  to do something like that because it's ridiculous.  I mean, to park your car in a garage in Manhattan is, what, Ben, $400 a month.  $400 a month to have the privilege of having your car in the city.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  You know, you have it in a garage and then you get it whenever you want.  So, I don't have the car in the city, you know, enough to do that.  So, I do the alternate side of the street parking.  And so, the car has been in the city the last couple weeks.  And I figure it would be really easy to move the car from one side of the street to the  other at 4.30 in the morning.  No.  But I'm having no luck with this thing.  So, what ends up happening is I jump in my car to drive 15 blocks to work, then put it  in a garage here that's about $20, right? 
[00:15:00]  $20, $25?  Yeah, for the day.  So, I'm spending $25 to drive to work.  15 blocks.  Dude, it's a 10-minute walk.  Yeah, you could have walked this morning.  It wasn't that bad.  No, that's kind of nice.  It's kind of warm out.  It's wacky weather.  So, I'm going to get my car and I don't know what's going on, but there's a lot of drunks  out there.  Yeah, I guess I'm not the only one.  I guess a lot of people...  Everybody must have today off.  That's got to be what it is.  Yeah.  It took me 10 minutes to get a taxi this morning. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  I think a lot of people had off, decided to party it up.  Yeah.  So, they're walking around in my neighborhood with beer bottles and stuff.  I'm like, what is going on?  Yeah.  And I forgot, we're the only idiots that decided to work this week.  Yeah.  I was definitely thinking about, at the beginning of the week, doing the Thursday, Friday, Wednesday,  Thursday, Friday thing off.  It would have been nice.  Oh, yeah.  We're stupid.  Well, when you're in satellite radio, though, this is a very important time of year.  A lot of people getting their XM satellite radios and you want to give them fresh programming. 
[00:16:00]  Although, this is not going to be a fresh radio show today.  Because you know what?  A little stale around the edges.  Oh, dude, we stink before we take a day or two off.  You know that.  We get way too distracted.  You know, none of us have done our Christmas shopping, so we're all thinking, all right,  tomorrow, what time we're going to get up to go to the malls to try to do that last  minute crap of getting the gift certificates.  So, we're all preoccupied.  You know from the past.  I'm done.  We put on a really good radio show, but before we go on vacation or before holidays, we stink. 
[00:16:30]  It's a little rough.  We absolutely stink.  And instead of faking it today, I think we need the help of the listeners.  Help us through this show.  Anthony's hungover.  I can't believe I'm hungover, and I've got to go to the downtown tonight.  For Jimmy Norton's show.  Go to Jimmy Norton tonight.  Yeah, we're all going there tonight.  Oh, cool, man.  It's going to be a good time.  Jim Norton at the downtown in Farmingdale.  I think it's pretty much sold out at this point.  Yeah, I think as of yesterday, there were 20 tickets left between the two shows.  That's great.  So, we'll see you all down at the downtown in Farmingdale on Long Island. 
[00:17:00]  And, yeah, you know, Jimmy strolled in late.  You know, we didn't even start reading the newspapers until 10 minutes ago.  They hadn't gotten in.  So, this show has a recipe for disaster today.  It really does.  Stay tuned.  And instead of, like, you know, faking it, maybe the listeners can help us through it today.  Maybe we'll do a lot of requests today.  What do you want to hear?  We've got all this crap around us.  Do you want to hear the farting Christmas song?  Do you want to hear?  What do you want to hear? 
[00:17:30]  What do you want to hear?  I don't know.  We've got some new stuff.  No, I mean, you know, we'll attempt to do a show.  Some of the classics.  Yeah, we'll attempt to do a show.  We'll play some of the fun stuff we have, too.  Exactly.  We've got to go to the phones and say hi to an old friend who I hear is very hammered.  Buzz!  Oh, am I on?  What's going on, Buzz?  Holy cow, you guys.  You guys are going to be huge.  I'm so glad to be back on with you.  My folks, my friends, Anthony, Opie, you're there. 
[00:18:00]  You guys are there, right?  Because it's always hard to hear you through the radio on the phone.  Hi, Devin.  We're all here.  Fantastic.  Is Jimmy there?  Yeah, it's me, sweetie.  Yeah!  Oh, my little cutie.  How are you?  Were you out last night?  Well, when you say last night, see, to you, you've already slept, and it's now last night.  I'm not sure what that meaning is because, well, no, I haven't gone to sleep yet. 
[00:18:30]  You are a partier, man.  It is Buzz from Home Alone, the older brother from Home Alone, completely hammered on our air.  Guys, this is huge.  This is big.  Two things I want to say.  First off, straight up, first of all, I don't usually sound like a raspy Kathleen Turner.  This is not the way I usually sound.  I am sick.  I do have a sore throat.  Shut up. 
[00:19:00]  You are hammered, man.  What bar were you at?  Oh, that's a long list, and I know you guys got a lot of short shows, so I can't go into all that now.  So, honestly, I got a sore throat, and this is not how I usually sound.  Right.  No, honestly, the doctor said, though, he said, have a lot of fluids, keep your throat moist,  and I'm following the doctor's orders very thoroughly.  With alcohol.  Well, he didn't specify what, Anthony.  Why are you getting on my back, okay? 
[00:19:30]  He said fluids.  Hey, Devin, did you try some throat yogurt?  That's usually helpful for a sore throat.  Oh, a little throat yogurt.  I stay faithful to you.  No throat yogurt for me.  That's why I, it's like a, it's kind of like an Annette Bening, Kathleen Turner voice that I have going on right now.  Wow, man.  You sound completely blotto, man.  There is none.  Now, there is blotto, but honestly. 
[00:20:00]  Dude, all I know is I was in the office getting ready for the show, and Martini Steve comes running in all excited.  He has you on the cell phone.  He's like, dude, Buzz is really effed up.  You want him to come in today?  I'm like, hell yeah.  He's like, you got to hear this guy.  He's completely gone.  Yeah, no, I know, you know, people get, people get the impression that perhaps just because I've been up, and just because I haven't gone to bed yet, and because it's quarter after six, and I've been drinking for a little bit, and now I'm having a nightcap, and people think I'm drunk. 
[00:20:30]  Obi, you should know this.  I mean, you have Irish blood in you, correct?  Yes, I do, sir.  Okay, so then you know what it's like.  I mean, Anthony, I mean, I've drank with his brother.  Believe me, I know how they drink.  Yeah, the Cummias could drink.  But then again, Anthony's hungover today because he had two little glasses of wine last night.  The Campari did you in, huh, Anthony?  No, a little of the Fareed wine. 
[00:21:00]  You'll serve no wine before it's time.  All right, is this Buzz, or is it Frankie Blue from WNEW here in New York?  I don't know who Frankie Blue is, but this is honestly, this is Buzz, this is Devin, this is your pal who we've not spoken for a long time, and I'm psyched that finally we're able to be back on the air.  I'm so glad you guys are back because when you were off...  Pleasure for me, Devin.  Pleasure for me.  Hey, they play that Home Alone movie all the time during Christmas. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, I know.  My friends always know when it's Christmas, they call me up and be like, yeah, I know it's the season because I see you all the time.  Don't you get the royalty checks?  Oh, yeah.  Don't you like being reminded how young you used to be?  Yeah, it's always nice to see how young and slender and beautiful I looked back then.  Dude, I saw you on TV recently, I think.  You played some kind of security guard and you got shot or something?  Oh, you're talking about Third Watch?  Oh, that was two years ago, dude. 
[00:22:00]  Well, I saw it recently.  I guess it was a rerun.  It was a rerun.  What show was that?  What was it?  That was Third Watch.  Yeah, Third Watch.  Yeah, you might...  I thought that you were talking about Criminal Intent.  I was just on that for the Halloween episode.  Everyone's coming back to do spots on all these crime shows that are on.  It's like the new Love Boat, all these things.  They just drag everyone out for the crime thing where people can play a security guard that gets shot or a criminal or a porn store employee. 
[00:22:30]  Yes, for those that can get the auditions.  Poor Jimmy.  I know.  I auditioned for...  What happened with the sequel for Spider-Man?  I was really hoping to expect to see you there.  Dude, my acting is atrocious.  I tried out for a part of a...  I tried out.  Right there that tells you I'm not a good actor instead of saying auditioning.  I tried out for...  Thanks, fella.  The part of a porn store clerk and I just bombed and didn't get it.  A, you're not a bad actor.  I've seen you act and you're actually a very good actor. 
[00:23:00]  I've seen you in Side Splitters with Jim Gaffigan and Louis Black and you're actually a very good comedic actor.  Oh, thank you.  Second of all, how the hell would they make you audition for the second one when you were in the first?  No, I mean, no, not in Spider-Man.  There's no porn store clerk in Spider-Man.  This was for...  It should have been.  Yeah, it absolutely should have been.  How's Macaulay Culkin?  Yeah, the question everyone wants to know, did Macaulay Culkin suck Michael Jackson's cock or what? 
[00:23:30]  That's the number one question.  That is...  I mean, honestly, like, guys, you joke around, but that's the number one question I'm asked every fucking day.  Oh, wait.  I'm sorry.  Hold on.  Wait, wait, wait.  You guys are in Satellite.  I have to ask.  Is it all right?  What can I say?  Dude, I just said cock.  Figure it out.  Did he wacko jacko?  Get in line, bro.  You know, if we could say that, I think everything goes.  So I can say, like, damn?  You can say damn.  So what do you...  I can say, like, hell. 
[00:24:00]  Is it all right for me to say hell?  What do you know about the Michael Jackson thing?  Come on.  What do you know?  Is it all right for me to say that Michael Jackson is a really funny cunt licker?  Yeah, of course.  I can say cunt licker?  You can.  Wow.  He might sue you for libel, though.  I know, yeah.  Well, he would definitely protest that.  He'd be like, there's no way I ever licked a cunt.  But look, honestly, I interviewed Michael Jackson.  I have the only known videotape of Macaulay Culkin and Michael Jackson together. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, hot.  It's not hot.  It's like an interview.  It can get your mind out of the gutter.  Is there anything on the tape that we can play on our satellite radio show?  Yeah, there is, actually.  There's a lot.  There really is.  Because it's during Home Alone 2, I did a documentary, like a behind-the-scenes, like a director's  cut, like, oh, hey, check out what's going on beyond the scenes of Home Alone 2.  Excuse me.  And Michael Jackson showed up on the set one day. 
[00:25:00]  Of course.  Yeah, well, we didn't know that.  It's like a buffet for him.  It's like showing up at the buffet table for Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  It's a little kid walking around.  Ooh, I'll take one of those.  Give me that tender, pale white ass.  Oh, my gosh.  You've got Macaulay and his brothers.  Ooh, Kieran will do for me.  I'm not going to...  You know, honestly, Michael was like a really...  He was, like, kind of cool on the set.  And I don't want to, like, down-talk him or say... 
[00:25:30]  Oh, please.  Look at the news.  Yeah.  You know, I can't really defend him anymore.  I can't do that.  It's been too many accusations, too much...  What have you seen?  ...people going against him.  It's like, what the hell's going on?  I've asked Macaulay about it.  Devin, what have you seen or heard?  I honestly asked Macaulay after I interviewed the two of them.  Yeah.  Like, I had my little two-minute clip, which would get me so much money if I were to sell it. 
[00:26:00]  And I was like, Macaulay, honestly, can you tell me?  I mean, at the time, he was 11.  And I was like, Macaulay, what do you talk about with Michael Jackson?  I mean, you're an 11-year-old kid, and he's a grown man.  What do you talk about, honestly?  And he kind of, you know, he looked at me, he's like, oh, we talk about, like, video games  and baseball cards, and they kind of trailed off with this look in his eye, like he wasn't  supposed to say anything more.  Oh. 
[00:26:30]  And I was like, Mac, I mean, don't you...  I mean, honestly, he's a cool guy, and I like his music, but what do you guys like?  I mean, do you, like, hang out?  He's like, oh, yeah, yeah.  He's like, we go pony back riding on the Neverland Ranch.  That's what they call it.  And I was like, wow, man.  Did he have to slap his hands on his cheeks and open his mouth and go, ho-lo-lo-lo-lo?  Oh.  Isn't that awful?  Someone's asking if your videotape is called One Night in Macaulay. 
[00:27:00]  I mean, you know, as my brother put it, because Macaulay is half Irish, half Scottish,  and she was like, Dev, Dev, my brother Luke, he's like, Dev, I got this great idea for  you.  It's an awesome idea.  I want to make a sequel on the movie.  It's an awesome idea.  It's about an Irish male prostitute, okay?  And we're going to call it ho-malone.  So, do it.  Run with it. 
[00:27:30]  Run with it.  I was like, oh, yeah, that's awesome, dude.  Yeah, ho-malone.  I'll totally do that.  Did you see me on third watch?  Jimmy's playing tomorrow night at the downtown.  There are only 20 tickets left.  Are you going to go?  Yeah, of course.  Do you guys still talk at all?  You and Macaulay Culkin, or no?  No, I went to a surprise birthday party.  The weirdest message I ever got on my voicemail, ever, was, it was like, hi, Dev, this is, 
[00:28:00]  and I honestly forget her name, this is blah, blah, blah, Macaulay Culkin's wife.  He, he, he, and she giggled.  She was like, I'm leaving a message.  I'd like to invite you to Macaulay's 18th surprise birthday party, and I couldn't believe  the fact that he was turning 18, and his wife was calling me, Rachel, Rachel, I forget  her name.  Rachel, you've come back.  She was calling me, inviting me to his surprise 18th birthday party. 
[00:28:30]  I saved the message, because it's classic.  We've spoken at his birthday party and stuff like that, but since I went on the show and  called him a dope-eyed dwarf midget faggot, then we haven't really spoke.  Ouch.  Hey, when can we hear the tape, the other video, the Michael Jackson, when can we hear the 14-year-old  exclusive interview?  You can bring that in someday, we can hear it? 
[00:29:00]  I really, you know, honestly, Chris Columbus, the director of the move, of Homeland 2, after  I did the interview with him, I was walking, and this was in 1992, because before any of  the scandals or anything, Chris was like, hey, Dev, by the way, you know, you could, you  could sell that tape for about 100 grand.  You'd never work in this business again, but you could sell it.  Why wouldn't you work again, just playing, you're not doing anything wrong by, what's  he going to do, Macaulay Culkin's not going to hurt your career, and what's Michael Jackson 
[00:29:30]  going to do, accuse you of showing him talking to a child?  You're not doing anything wrong.  Dude, Michael Jackson's taking on Eminem.  I mean, I'm not like in that realm, and Macaulay, actually, I like the kid, despite what everyone  says, he's a good kid.  I don't want to piss him off.  But I mean, you're not doing anything bad, though, just by showing an interview.  It's not like you took, like, hot footage of those two alone, it's just you talking to  them.  Yeah, I mean...  They were very open.  Is the tape that outrageous, or what?  Well, no, I have been contacted, honestly.  I've been contacted people, especially because the trial's about to start. 
[00:30:00]  We'll give you, I don't know, $100 and maybe a bottle of scotch.  Yeah.  Your word?  We'll put you on the couch and throw some cherry darts at your back door.  Oh, hey, that's not bad.  Why don't you throw it in your VCR right now, and let's listen to it.  Oh, wait, wait, what kind of scotch are we talking?  The good stuff.  Yep.  The real good stuff.  Oh, come on.  Don't be that doers.  Do you have it in your house, like, right now?  No, not on me.  Not on me. 
[00:30:30]  Can't pop it in, and...  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That's where this is going?  Well, we wanted to, you know, maybe hear it, but...  Hey, why don't you tell everybody, also, the big story, who your dad is?  Oh, my God.  You know, it was...  My dad is a very fine actor.  Yes.  Anthony.  I know.  He's a very fine actor.  I've got a DVD, actually, that you gave me, which I still have not been able to watch.  You haven't watched some of your dad's work? 
[00:31:00]  We've been working on this for years with our buddy, Buzz.  We wanted...  I watched one scene of it.  I watched one scene of it, and I was in your office, and you saw me watch it.  And the opening scene is my dad being very, very friendly with an English maid in the toolshed.  And at that point, I had to scream and run out of the office, and I hope you turned it off.  This is one of the better stories that we've ever had. 
[00:31:30]  His dad is Peter Rattray.  He's a fantastic actor.  He's been in The Abyss.  He was on The New People, a TV series by Rod Serling, the guy who did The Twilight Zone.  Uh-huh.  And he's been in other films.  Of course.  But what was that movie called that you watched in our office?  Well, I'm going to ask his permission first to talk about it, because as you remember,  three years ago, my dad said, listen, I love you, Dev, and Opie and Anthony, I support you 
[00:32:00]  and your show, but why don't you try not to talk about my career on the radio?  Ah.  Well, it was just a very popular movie, especially back in the 70s.  It was a popular movie.  Oh, yeah.  Your dad was in a popular 70s movie?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Ooh.  One that used to come on Cinema 100, which was one of the first cable outlets on Long Island,  and would come on very late at night.  Dude, I myself am very proud of my dad's career. 
[00:32:30]  My dad's been an actor for 40 years.  He's been in loads of things.  And you've got to understand.  I made one mistake.  In the 70s, it was different, man.  If you're making an art picture, if you're making an artistic film that happened to have  certain scenes or women in it who were naked, then it got a reputation.  Uh-huh.  And it's not, you know, it wasn't, it's not exactly, I mean, nowadays, it's almost child's play. 
[00:33:00]  But back then, it got a bad reputation, and it was very popular because it was a very beautiful film.  Of course it was.  It was a cinemagraphic masterpiece, I might at say.  Yes.  I understand.  I used to watch it on Cinema 100.  Oh, no.  What's the name of this movie? 
[00:33:30]  Sylvia.  What's the name of the movie?  Um, uh, Devin, uh, the name, the name would be...  Are you, are, is anybody IMD being it right now?  Oh, of course I did.  Of course I did.  Yeah, I'm way ahead of you, it's right in front of me.  I don't want to yell the name of the film, but is her name Sylvia Christelle, I think,  from what I remember, it's been a long time since I've seen that.  Um, no, no.  No, no.  Harley McBride was in it.  That's the, the chick.  Um.  Harley McBride, that, right there, that should, that should settle it for anyone who's out there 
[00:34:00]  wondering what this film is.  Your dad, Peter, played Paul, the young gardener.  Why do you have to, like, what, are you reading the biop, the biography of it now?  Yeah.  It's, uh, actually, it got good reviews, it's a, a classic.  It's a good movie.  Yeah.  It, it, you know, and back in the day, it was misunderstood.  Mm-hmm.  They thought that perhaps it was more graphic than it had to be.  Yeah.  And it got an X rating, but they actually made it a beautiful X rating. 
[00:34:30]  It was actually, it, it was rated beautiful X.  And, uh, I, I like the fact that your father is on the cover of the, uh, the movie and in  the poster.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  My father is so well-endowed.  Is he packing, really?  Dude.  I mean, I haven't watched the movie, so you can probably tell me better.  This show is Mule in the movie?  That's pretty edgy for the 70s.  It's, it's Young Lady Chatterley is the name of the movie. 
[00:35:00]  1977.  That's great.  What's wrong with that, Devin?  Come on, it's almost, you know, 30 years, 20 some odd years ago.  I'm not going to run the risk of pissing my dad off just because you guys got a Jones  for Harley McBride.  I'll, I'll, I'll read some of the other stuff.  He was in Ryan's Hope, Another World.  Ryan's Hope, that's the reason why we moved to New York City.  The autobiography of G. Gordon Liddy?  Yes, he played Will.  He played, uh, he played, uh, John, um, well, you got the information. 
[00:35:30]  John Dean.  John Dean, thank you.  Yeah, he was in The Abyss.  Oh, yeah.  Did you see The Abyss?  I mean, my dad was greatly at this.  He was the captain of the USS Montana.  Yes, he was the captain of the submarine of the USS Montana when he goes down.  Funny enough, he goes down in another movie.  Oh!  Oh, very good.  Hey, baby doll, I have a question for you.  Yes, Mr. Norton.  You were on Law and Order, Criminal Intent, uh, Halloween, right?  Yes, I was.  Were you, was Vincent D'Onofrio on the set? 
[00:36:00]  Well, of course, yeah, my students were with him, yes.  Oh, okay, did he, was this when he was losing his shit over the carry, uh, loss or no?  He, uh, he was, uh, not a, uh, very, uh, personable person to approach.  Oh, really?  Yes, I, I've worked with much, um, friendlier people.  Wow.  Anybody, you know, he's very, uh, I mean, you, you get the, anyone, any person where you  get a breakdown of his personality from the PAs before you get onto the set. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, you know you have to sort of, like, step back from him.  Now, when you get around Vincent, um, don't talk much.  Yes.  Don't, uh, you know, he's very intense.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I said, I said PAs, I meant ADs, it's the associate producers.  When the producers actually approach you and they're like, Mr. D'Onofrio has very specific,  uh, tastes and very specific moods, all your scenes are going to be shot early in the morning,  and he, uh, doesn't necessarily respond very well to people in the morning. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, God.  Well, I mean, I guess I can understand that.  Seven in the morning, who the hell wants to talk to me?  Except you guys!  So, so, was it, he just didn't talk to you that much?  Uh, he, uh, no, no, he, I mean, I forced conversation with him.  And tell you the truth, once I started talking to him, the dude's cool, he just, um, he's,  you know, he's not someone you want to approach. 
[00:37:30]  In a bar, if you don't know him, like, he's not a friendly guy at all.  But I talked to him, because the first thing I said was like, yo, um, you worked with Mr. Kubrick.  That must have been pretty amazing.  Was he, was he, you know, how was he to work with?  And he kind of looked at me and gave me a bunch of stoic answers.  But since this is radio, I'm going to cut to the good part.  And he was like, Mr. Kubrick was a, was an awesome guy.  Of course, I'm referring to one of Norton's favorite movies.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, Comer Pyle.  And that was his favorite, that was his first movie. 
[00:38:00]  That was his fucking introduction into film.  My first movie is fucking Where the Children.  You know, with Joe Kleberg and Frederick, I'm a Freak, Forrest.  His first movie is Full Metal Jacket, for God's sake.  So, you know, some guys get all the luck.  And he's, you know, and he worked, he worked on it from there.  And my brother was shooting, was shooting the Prince of Nigeria at the time.  So I started talking to him about that. 
[00:38:30]  And that got him kind of interested.  He's actually interested in world affairs and politics.  But he's not someone who's just like, hey, you were a great cockroach in Men in Black.  Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt.  Am I cut off?  No, it's just, it's wonderful.  Buzz, drunk.  I'm in a very talkative mood for some reason.  Buzz, drunk alone.  Let me see, who else can I alienate? 
[00:39:00]  All right, Buzz.  Did I talk about my mother yet?  All right, Buzz.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  When are you coming in to see us?  Honestly, seriously, I know that you guys think that I'm not.  Thank God.  Wow, thank God.  God, do I want to see that videotape now.  He's got to bring that in.  Oh, I know, I know.  Well, we'll work on him.  Back.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Yeah, here we are, the day before we leave for Christmas, I guess. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  It's going to be a little weird today.  But we do have a new Christmas song, Anthony, from Brother Joe.  Yes, we do.  It's a Ben Sparks tribute Christmas song.  Look at that.  I love when we pull these out and they're surprises.  Oh, he hates this stuff.  Ben's like, oh, it's me.  Ben doesn't like being the center of attention at all.  Is that the other one?  Oh, no.  No, this is a brother.  You haven't seen this guy?  He sent me an email.  No, he sent me an email, but I thought he was kidding.  This is going to be very catchy for everybody.  Of course.  You're going to want to sing the chorus at home?  It's all about Ben. 
[00:40:00]  Sing along to this fine Christmas song from Brother Joe about Ben Sparks.  It's called Herky Jerky Christmas.  Have a Herky Jerky Christmas, like you work for O&A.  Eat a dish of some bad fish, just like old gravy lay.  Have a Herky Jerky Christmas, comb your hair with a car bomb.

[00:53:00]  soaked it up it's just too bad i'll never get a chance to use what i learned but other wives can learn  uh from me they and then the printer cuts it off the same oh they're in this if they're in the same  boat very funny my hubby scott never listened to me uh the book says communication was key  why didn't he listen uh why he called it nagging when i i talked i call it being and then it's cut 
[00:53:30]  off again i can't uh why are we still i can't decipher these printouts because  why can't why can't they fix this in the in the not only why can't they fix this we've been  having this problem ever since we started here at xm satellite radio but uh ben and and eric and steve  continue to hand them into us like that yeah steve you try who gave you that i don't know and 
[00:54:00]  they're like this is really funny you got to read it how do you know if it's funny if it's if the whole  right side is cut off i think i could get this one from little connor he he put a review in i've been  spending all my days at sea for the last year or so and it has been hard for me to get my sex life  going but this book really knocked my socks off it knocked me right out of the womb  and then there's one from uh s peterson from modesto that i don't think i can read 
[00:54:30]  uh can we get a copy of that that's good for for us for um after reading this book it was as if my  sex life was a small boat now uh all that dead weight has been thrown over the side  very good now my sex life is as exciting as a fishing trip 
[00:55:00]  very funny oh is that it and now how come this we can read what was done  that this one is fine and this one was not i think uh what happened was nathaniel had to adjust  the uh monitors yes i think when nathaniel printed it out he had to adjust the margins when he printed 
[00:55:30]  it yeah okay so so wait a minute there was a solution yeah and it we were still getting these  i don't know i i who handed it to you i don't even know but it got fixed  all right very good yeah should we read the first page  oh jesus  uh this one is from a guy named uh howard i bought this book for my wife and daughter and it caused 
[00:56:00]  nothing but problems my daughter ended up getting drunk and at the hospital uh my wife divorced me  uh in the end i did it all for allison allison  so the book uh didn't help everybody i guess  i was disappointed that shannon neglected to cover the monster rain topic 
[00:56:30]  for this book i recommend oh for this i would recommend a book by dr james norton logs and yellow  discipline  oh god damn the internet is so funny a very stimulating read shannon does a wonderful job  explaining that sexually stimulating crinkle crinkle sound of a paper bag before sex is merely  the equivalent to pavlov's theory ah i found the book as useful as some other bestsellers such as 
[00:57:00]  the old gravy leg and connor the man who will never be  people are horrible that's very funny that's from a guppy's breakfast  are you ready kids  hi hi captain i can't hear you  hi hi captain

[01:11:00]  Sorry  And then Ben gets him with a good one  Ben's very saucy today  Very saucy  Yeah  Alright, well, let's go to Rachel  Rachel in Virginia  What's up, Rachel?  Rachel  Rachel  Alright, hold on, hold on, Rachel  Now I have to do this  Alright, go ahead, Rachel  Good morning, guys  How are you?  Good morning  Good morning, Rachel  Thanks for calling the program  Good morning, Jimmy  It's my first call of the show  And I'm actually a new listener  My husband got me hooked  Oh  Well, welcome  I do, I do really enjoy it  But one thing I just wanted to ask about 
[01:11:30]  Was the  I'm a little bothered by the  Constant Lacey and Connor references  And I just wanted to  Ask you guys  Don't say you guys  I'm with you, Rachel  I'm  I'm completely with you  No  I don't get the obsession  With this stupid case  That these guys have  I'm just trying to understand  Are you guys  Is it because you're kind of using laughter  To deal with it  Or is it because you really just don't give a shit  No, they don't give a shit  No  That is not true 
[01:12:00]  They completely don't give a shit  Not true  See, on the outside  It might look like that  They're obsessed to the point  Where I believe they don't give a shit  But I think what we do here  On this program  Is more of a reaction  To the media frenzy  That surrounds these cases  And it's almost as if  They're asking for it  Nice spin, spin doctor  Are you insane?  It's almost as if  They're asking for it  Yeah  No, I get that  I'm Joel O'Reilly  Hope to see you again next time  Remember, the spin stops here 
[01:12:30]  Because we are  Looking out for you  Anthony could spin his way out of anything  Are you insane?  I'm right  You don't give a flying shit about her  If the media  Her  You don't care about Connor  If the media and the people  In this country  Weren't so fixated on this  And so starved for any bit of information  And all the gruesomeness  And wanting to know  If Scott is going to jail  Or getting the death penalty  Then they want to know  The condition of Lil' Connor 
[01:13:00]  And they want  Like, the people  Were in a frenzy over this case  And our reaction to that  Is to joke about it  Which then, you know  Pisses off  The multitude of people  That are worse than we are  Because they're voyeuristic  And they want to know more about this  What's that?  Sorry  You guys do have some sick listeners  Well, look  If the media can use it  To sell papers  And to be a lead story 
[01:13:30]  Which generates advertising dollars  Why can't we use it for humor?  I mean, I know it sounds  A creepy thing  But it's like, you know  Whenever you use something in humor  People have a weird standard with it  But yet if it's used to sell newspapers  It's just considered honest journalism  And you're giving people what they want  But you guys are obsessed with it  You're absolutely obsessed  I wouldn't say obsessed  It really is a terrible thing  We obviously know the whole thing is terrible  The fact that he's no longer able to be with Amber Frye 
[01:14:00]  You know  I mean, so  It's awful  I guess I understand  Sorry  You guys do make me laugh a lot  A lot of times  When I'm feeling crappy  I turn you guys on  Anytime throughout the day  And I get a good laugh  And you guys cheer me up  Thank you, Rachel  Well, they knew that something was wrong  When he said  You take care of Connor  He goes, yeah  You won't see you know him no more  We actually have two sons  My husband wanted to name  We named one of them Connor  Actually, after this all happened  But, you know 
[01:14:30]  Maybe it's bad  I don't know  But, whatever  Did you get him those little  Swimmy things for his arms?  Yeah  Alright, I gotta run  Thanks, guys  Kevin Meaney  Has that bit  That he goes  Yeah, I just had a child  In the audience class  And he goes  We named her Jean Benet  And he's serious  He's totally serious  And the crowd just goes  Ooh  What?  It's a family name  Isn't that nice?  That's a name that'll never be used  Connor is pretty common  Yeah  But you just  You'll never see another 
[01:15:00]  Little Jean Benet walking around  Absolutely not  Cowboy hat and boots  Write that name for everybody, right?  Cha-cha-cha  Little Jimmy Durante  Get up on that stage  Jean Benet  Well, we won't go there  Alright  Now we're gonna try to take a break  Very good  She was  She was happy with the program  For the most part  This is what I wanted to play  The sexual harassment  Right  Audio here  Alright  You hear about sexual harassment on TV 
[01:15:30]  And it makes the headlines in newspapers  As an employee  What do you need to know about it?  First  Sexual harassment is against the law  And it's against your company's policy  So what is sexual harassment?  Linda, you are doing a fine job here  Oh, well, thank you, Steve  But you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work  I'm sorry?  I mean, we're talking about your job here  There may be physical harassment 
[01:16:00]  Wow  You're really tense today, Nancy  Ow!  Bill!  Sorry  You looked really tense  You know, I really don't like it when you do that  Can you please stop?  I'll never stop, Nancy  Never  Never  In some instances, the harassment may be verbal  Word around the office is you've got a fat cock  Yes, I do 
[01:16:30]  I've got a fat cock, too  Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime  Maybe a little oil  Two fat cocks  Together  Oil  It might be visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings  Sexual harassment is not always about sex  It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate 
[01:17:00]  Man  I could go for a power fuck right now  Change is slow  And what was acceptable in common behavior years ago can now be sexual harassment  Smells like vagina in here  Excuse me?  Smells like fresh vagina in here  Are you talking about my vagina?  Maybe  Everyone wants to be treated fairly and with respect 
[01:17:30]  Treat your co-workers with the courtesy and respect that you want for yourself  It's your company's policy  And it's the law  Grandma got run over by a reindeer  Tell us every year, you friggin' nerd 
[01:18:00]  Glad to hear about your drunken grandma  That tanked up bitch got just what she deserved  Well, I spent that fateful Christmas  With the dick that wrote this song  Granny drank whiskey with quaaludes  While toking sense of me and from a bomb  I tried to greet his evil grandma 
[01:18:30]  But she kicked me in the nuts  She was sucking on a crack pipe  Yelling piss off, die you bastard scumbag puss  Granny got run over by a reindeer  Every time I hear that song I twitch  Don't feel bad about that psycho grandma  Grandpa paid old Santa off to hit the bitch 
[01:19:00]  There was dinner on the table  Granny's crawling underneath  Didn't know what she was up to  Till I saw that big old smile on Uncle Pete  Granny left to score some Valium  Took off running down the path  That's when old Saint Nicky creamed her 
[01:19:30]  Grandpa thanked Rudolph while kissing Santa's ass  Granny got run over by a reindeer  Copping dope outside on Christmas Eve  Good riddance to that evil demon grandma  As for me and Grandpa, we're relieved  Oh, Granny was a ho  What happened to the potatoes?

[01:24:00]  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony program 
[01:24:30]  It's a sloppy one, but we're having a good time  It's, uh, the holidays  We warned you at the beginning of the show  Yeah, we're really, really distracted  Right before we take a day or two off  Especially with the holidays here  And Christmas Eve is, what, tomorrow?  And none of us have shopped or done anything for that yet, right?  Done nothing  And, uh, we're in break  And Norton just casually mentions that, uh 
[01:25:00]  Him and Mike Tyson once made out with the same tranny  Tranny?  Tranny  No  Tranny?  Jack Crawford sent a tranny to me  A tranny  Tranny  Yeah  How did that happen?  Uh, at the Porn Award last year  Ah, that would wear it  I was at the expo  Well, you were, you were  We were talking about Tyson  Because there's a story in the paper  And, uh, you know  We asked Norton if you ever got a picture with, uh, Tyson  And you said yes  I met him twice  He's been very nice to me both times 
[01:25:30]  And then you got video of him  Well, yeah, I have to hear from you  Oh, she's got it  Uh, I, I  I think you had me and said it to me  Oh, yeah, video of me and Tyson talking  And then, uh, I, I  This transsexual named Vanity, who's a porn star  Um, was gonna be my date  For the  It was a goof  Yeah  It's a goof  Yeah, there's a little Vanity kiss me  And, you know, whatever  It was on film  It was in front of 50 people  What kind of kiss?  Like a nice, friendly one  Was it an open mouth?  I don't think so, but I  Oh, stop it  What do you mean you don't think so?  That means it was  No, no, I'll tell you the truth 
[01:26:00]  If I get the video, I don't remember  Ah  But then  I don't think so means  I think they got on videotaped  So I better just, uh  No, no, okay  And you knew it was a tranny  No, I kind of suspected  No, not kind of  No, I, I didn't have confirmation  You knew, and it was a French kiss  No, I didn't, I didn't have confirmation  Until after  Um  Ha, la, la, la, la  No, I didn't do that  No  But, um  Tyson, the next day  Was, uh, mugging  With, uh, Vanity as well  Really?  Yeah  And, um  And it's on video 
[01:26:30]  So he, oh, you, you kissed  It first  He basically kissed my girl  Aww  Hey, you  Take your goddamn hands off her  Unhand that parental disappointment  When you got video of, uh, Tyson doing this  Yeah, I think Yoshi has it  I'm almost positive  Yeah  Wow  Yeah, I actually remember him telling me about it  And I think I've seen the video  I'll just, I'll call him today and ask him  But that would be very nice for  And Mike was talking to you on the video  He's, he's actually speaking 
[01:27:00]  Well, he, he, dude  The energy this guy walks around with  Is, it's a whirlwind  I was in the Evil Angel booth  With, like, Joey Silvera  And all those guys  And, uh, Buttman  Buttman  Oh, Buttman  Wow  And Tyson walks in  And him and 50 Cent were at the expo  And so there was a massive mob of people  Yoshi actually called my room  He's like, dude, Mike Tyson's around  So I came down  Grabbed your camera and ran out  You bet I did  And I don't know how Yoshi gets near these people  But he did  And he got Mike Tyson to come into the  The little area we were hanging out in  So Tyson comes in 
[01:27:30]  And he's spanking chicks in front of everybody  It's on film  With that big mitt  He was  And he was, like, just talking  And Yoshi somehow said  This is Jim Norton  He's from Comedy Central  He's co-hosting the award show  So Tyson puts his arm around me  Uh-oh  And he's like, uh  Yeah, I'm with Jim Norton  From Comedy Central  And he's just talking  And he keeps telling me to talk about him  At the award show  He's like  I'm gonna ass-rape you, you little man  Oh, I thought of you guys the whole time  I'm like, how fucking great would this be on the air  Unfortunately, we were off  I'm gonna titty-screw you  Come here  This might hurt when I flop it out on your chest 
[01:28:00]  Because it's merely huge  It's merely gigantic  You're gonna love it  You're used to having logs on your chest  Try this one  It's a whole tree trunk  Wow, put his arm around you  Was it heavy?  Um, he's just a  Yeah  He's a fucking man's man  Yeah, you just  He's got an energy with him, man  That is just really intimidating  He's a very intimidating guy  Obviously  Did you find him to be bright? 
[01:28:30]  Or  Well, I didn't agree with his physics theories  We parted ways on certain  Right  You know, quasar  Light emission theories  But  He was actually very nice to me  Again, I guess if you hang out with him  And he doesn't punch you in the face  Or fuck your mouth  You can put it in the plus column  That don't leave many people  Let me tell you  Yeah, there's a story in the paper  This is how bright Mike is 
[01:29:00]  He goes to a party  Because he's, you know  Socialite  And he had no idea what was going on  He goes to a party  The boxer told organizers  That Carmen Electra  Had said to meet her at the museum  But she stood him up  Didn't show up  The burly boxer paid a surprise visit  To the Guggenheim  While the glamorous Christian Dior  Artist's ball  Was in full swing  Imagine you having your  Christian Dior artist's ball 
[01:29:30]  At the Guggenheim  And this animal  Walks through the door  My God  Somebody's opened the gate to the zoo  He was quoted as saying  Dior?  Is that a deodorant?  A clearly confused Tyson asked  When a reporter asked  What he was wearing  Once the reporter explained  It was a fashion house  Tyson said  Oh, I'm wearing Versace 
[01:30:00]  When his clothes were clearly labeled  Rock-a-wear  How do you spell Versace?  O-O-C-A-W-E-A-R  Versace  But the elegant Dior  Clad socialites  Were thrilled to see Tyson  No matter what  Posing for pictures  That's what happens  These people are like  It's like when  It's like when all the photographers came  And  I want to get a picture of Kong  Let me get up there  Put the girl in front of Kong  You know, all the socialites 
[01:30:30]  Like that kind of thing  Take a picture of me  With this beast  And they did  Heather Graham was there  I guess  Roller girl  Josh Lucas  Yes  Christina Ricci  And her head  Her huge forehead  I'd like to punch her  In the forehead  It's as big as my fist  So he didn't even know  Where he was  Christian Dior  Let's go to the phones  Talk to Chris in New York  Hey Chris, what's up?  Yo guys  Hey  How much longer  You're going to put up  With this fucking  Hollow you're sitting next to here 
[01:31:00]  Every day  Every day  Norton gets fucking  More faggy  What kind of language  Is that to use  On the radio show, sir?  Bro, what's up, man?  Every day  You're doing something more gay  Sir, that was a year ago  Dude  He's not gay  He's not gay  Because it was a year ago  That's right  Go suck another  Second grade dick, Norton  I'm out of here  Wait, sir  Ouch  Wait, mister  That was uncalled for  That certainly was  Harsh talk  Jimmy, you do have  A lot of faggy stories  I've got to admit  Well, who doesn't? 
[01:31:30]  But you knew the guy  The guy was a guy  That's a chick, man  That's a little odd  Dude, you look at her  She's like  She's a chick  But she has a dick  But I didn't see that  It's a chick  I'll show you a picture of her  And you go, oh, okay  You know something?  There is not one tranny  That I've ever looked at  And not known it was a tranny  I've never seen one  That didn't have that  Telltale little  How you doing?  Or the big  Adam's Apple  The voice, the Adam's Apple  Or the dead giveaway  The hands  I was so paranoid  In Brazil about that  Because that's where 
[01:32:00]  The operations are very good  Oh, yeah?  That I passed up  Patrice told me I was crazy  He's like, that's not  An ex-guy  But I was so paranoid  About it  That there was a lot of  Hot ones that actually  Walked away from  There were certain qualities  They had  And I'm like, that's a post-op  Remember Tula?  Tula?  Tula  Oh, yeah  It was a famous  Sex change operation  Sure  Turned out  She was a  She, he, it, whatever  Was a Bond girl  In a James Bond movie  One of the  Like a helicopter pilot  Or something  And  Hot  Turned out 
[01:32:30]  Used to be a guy  Went through the operation  Did a spread in Playboy  And it turned out  It looked kind of like  A real vag down there  They did the operation  And that's like  The only  The only one I've ever seen  That used to be a guy  That kind of looked  Like a girl  Everything else  You're like  Ugh  So  Man hands  So is it  Is it gay  If it used to be a guy  But it now has a vag  And you  Have sex  I think so  No, it's all where your heart is 
[01:33:00]  I think it's  It's kind of gay  You don't  You just don't  And especially  Like she would have to explain it to you  Before anything happened  Because afterwards  There's a  A chance  Somebody'd kill her  How do you go through that  Like oh wow  I'm really  I'm really digging this chick  You know  Have great sex  We need  Need a lot of KY  For some reason  But  You know  Her vag feels great  It feels exactly like  An inside out penis  Ah 
[01:33:30]  I guess that's what they do right  Yeah  They  They  They gut your  Schlong  And turn it inside out  They don't just lop it off  They  They remove the testes  And then they  Use the scrote  To fashion some kind of labia  And then they  They  Gut your  Schween  Reroute your  Urethra  How do you know all this?  I read a lot  And then they  They pack it inside you  Got ourselves a reader  Got ourselves a reader  And they pack it inside you 
[01:34:00]  And all of a sudden  You're  You got a vag  But meanwhile  If a guy is with  This person  What you're really doing  Is just rubbing schlongs  I've had a couple  That were questionable  Post obviously  With vages  But there was something  On that  I don't know  It was a weird vibe  And there was  No but there was no  I was having sex  You could actually  Have sex  It just didn't feel right  It was an escort  Years ago  I'm like  And you thought it might have  Previously  Just creeped me out  Yeah yeah  And there was no way  It was probably the smell 
[01:34:30]  No no no  You couldn't tell  Of man's sack  It's just like  Was it the anchor tattoo  On her arm  Mom  It was  I don't know what it was  Maybe some things  I think are instinct  Yeah  Yeah  Sometimes you just  Intuition  Or it just didn't feel right  It was like  Ew  I had a bag on too  It was like  But I just  So you're not gay  Because you had a bag on  So there was no real contact  No but I mean  I couldn't tell  So obviously  You didn't finish  With the guy that's now a woman  No I actually didn't  It was like  Oh you didn't  No  No  Disgusting me

[01:47:30]  Howdy ho  Virgin Mary was sleeping  When Angel Gabriel appeared  He said you are to be the virgin mother  But Mary thought that was weird  Mary said I'm not a virgin  I blew a guy last year  But then Gabriel said to Mary  My child have no fear  Cause you can suck all the dick you want 
[01:48:00]  And still be a virgin  Mary  You can suck all the dick you want  And still not be considered flawed  Although you went to town  And suck some semen down  You're still a virgin  In the eyes of God  There was no room at the inn  When Mary and Joseph did arrive  But they were so very tired  He said Mary had to offer a bribe 
[01:48:30]  Since she had no money  How would she pay for a place to sleep  Gabriel appeared to Mary  And told her not to wait  Cause you can suck all the dick you want  And still be a virgin  Mary  You can suck all the dick you want  And still be the mother of Christ  If there's no room at the inn  Then it's not considered a sin  To suck some dick 
[01:49:00]  To get a room for the night  Then three wise men did appear  Bearing gifts of myrrh and such  They said that they had followed a star  And missed a woman's touch  Mary thought she might pleasure them  But could not take them to bed  But again Gabriel appeared to her  And this is what he said  You can suck all the dick you want 
[01:49:30]  And still be a virgin  Mary  You can suck all the dick you want  Everyone that hangs in the nation  Felicia ain't no sin  Gonna blow those three wise men  And you'll still be a virgin  Cause there was no penetration  So you can suck all the dick you want  And still be a virgin  Mary  The donkey and the ox and the lens  And even the little drummer boy  People will remember your name quick

[01:53:00]  A smallpox epidemic  How could that be possible?  And the reason is  Because the smallpox vaccine that we were given  And that I was told was going to last forever  Wore off  And our government waited until a possible emergency condition  To inform us  Now that's a crackerjack group of fuckers, isn't it?  How could you fucking not call us? 
[01:53:30]  Hey Lou  Your smallpox vaccine wore off  You want another?  You fucking wait!  I want another!  Because my whole life has been a delusion  Because every day I'd wake up and I'd go  You know  It's going to suck today  But at least I'm not getting smallpox  To wait as long as the federal government waited  To tell us about this 
[01:54:00]  It's as if you went to a public bathroom  And you flushed the toilet  And the toilet water just hit you in the face  And then as you walked out of the bathroom  Around the door was a big sign  Warning  Toilet water may hit you in the face  If I get smallpox  I'll file suit against the federal government  Because they took me out of a very important class  To get that vaccine  And if I'd taken that class  I would have to do this bullshit for a living  I'd have a real job 
[01:54:30]  Like with WorldCom or Enron or Tyco  Or Global Crossing  Or Adelphia  Well Jimmy Norton is very excited  For the next segment on the O.P. and Anthony program 
[01:55:00]  As we all are  Yes  Outside the studio  Bernard Getz  Bernard Getz  The subway vigilante  You might remember him as that  One of the biggest New York City stories  In the last 20 years  Easily right  Yeah  You had the son of Sam  You had  It was huge  Lana Brawley  Yeah  Chambers  And yeah  And Bernie  Who's about to enter the studio  Joel Steinberg  Was a big New York story 
[01:55:30]  Yep  Yeah  He's like  Bring him on in  Look at him  He's like  When am I coming in  There he is  Bernard Getz  Great  How are you  Good  Very good  How you doing  Oh wow  Very nice  This is like  This is like another  Good radio station  It's the real deal  Yeah  Excellent  How you been  Pretty good  Pretty good  Keeping busy  Oh yeah  I wish I had more time  In my life and stuff  By the way  What are we going to talk  You guys  It doesn't take much  To push you over the edge  I'm ready to do it 
[01:56:00]  You know  Oh we can talk about anything  But if we could talk about  Just drugs  Or the shooting  Or crime  Or maybe we could talk about  Legal stuff  Bad cases make bad law  We could talk about stuff  On my website  Whatever  About maybe like  Ground zero  What they're planning on  Building there  Really is very lousy  I think very mediocre  I agree with that  Oh good  Maybe we can talk about that some  And then  Vegetarianism  You know  Moral stuff  Really  Moral stuff  Like people 
[01:56:30]  There are things in life  Like animals feel  And people  All people  In a way  Are psychologists  Because we have language  And we have words  For things like  Fear  And anger  Love  Grief  And all  All those things  Are things that  Are important  Well I think these things  Are important in life  Alright  And we can talk about  All of them  And how you can  Deal with some of them  Maybe  Maybe get some positive  Stuff out of it  New York politics  Absolutely  New York politics  I think is real negative 
[01:57:00]  What do you like  Being called  Bernie or Bernard  Bernie's easier  Bernie is easier  Why don't we  Why don't we recap  For the national audience  I know it was a huge  New York story  Years ago  What year was the shooting  84  84  December of 84  It was a huge story  But if you could  You know  I guess you'd be best  Qualified to tell  The national audience  What happened  Back then  Okay  I got on a subway car  On a Saturday afternoon  And I was going  To a specific location  By the way 
[01:57:30]  This came up  With another interview  Before  I was going  To a meeting  Where I was  Meeting some people  And on the train  After I sat down  I got surrounded  By a group  And I wound up  Shooting all four  Of them  And fled the scene  And I later  Turned myself in  And I gave a version  Of events to people  That I was trying  To recreate  I was rather  Confused at the time  But I actually  Gave a lot  Of good information  And we actually  We didn't get  The correct information 
[01:58:00]  About  With the forensic evidence  Until about  One and three quarter  Years later  At the trial  Really?  Now what  We were rather stunned  To find that  One of the guys  Was only shot one time  KB?  That's correct  We were counting bullets  Doing bullet inventory  And stuff like that  And certain things  Just didn't make sense  And when we found out  That KB was only shot  One time  It was only at that point  That we could accurately  Recreate the shooting  And  Now  It was assumed 
[01:58:30]  That he was shot  More than once  That's right  You know  They say in a high  Publicity story  I've heard it said  On  In the media  That  If  If  If a piece of  Misinformation  Goes  Goes out on the news  And it's not refuted  Within 24 hours  Then  It becomes fact  It's fact  Regardless  And yeah  And so in my case  You had it for  One and three quarter years  The case  Was  It encouraged  Racial resentment  In New York  Well it certainly did  Yeah  And if you  If you ask black people 
[01:59:00]  Today for example  And I mean  This is a little painful  To say  What in New York City  What their opinions are  About my case  Probably  At least 80% of them  Will say it's  They're somewhat vague  About their reasons  But they'll say  It's somewhat of a racial case  Right  Or they'll basically say  It's a racial case  You also had the courts  Wasted a whole bunch of time  They wasted  But if they would have  Successfully harmed you  It wouldn't have been  A racial case  It would have just been  Another mugging  That's right  But other negative things  That came out of it 
[01:59:30]  The courts  For example  In New York  Rewrote the law  Based on my case  The law of self-defense  The law basically  They said  Now every shot  Is to be judged  Individually  Oh really  Yeah  Now it turns out  That in reality  All my shots  I got off  Between 1.5  To 1.6 seconds max  You do something  Called speed shooting  Some people  I don't know  If you're familiar  With it or not  And just to clarify  Because I've seen  Some things  Not said exactly  In the media  You do aim 
[02:00:00]  But you pull  The trigger  Before you aim  You aim  But you pull  And you do that  With a revolver  I don't know  How to do it  With an automatic  And you basically  While you're pulling  The trigger  You just try to keep  That barrel lined up  On the target  And that's about it  And you can do  Very fast shooting  And it's not that  Much of a trick  I think speed typing  I think is more  Of a skill  If you can  Drive a car  If you steer a car  With one hand  In a way  That's good practice  For shooting 
[02:00:30]  A car they say  Is a 3,000 pound bullet  So people can  Misuse a car  And they can  Just like you  Can misuse a gun  When the news came out  It said that you  At one point said  You don't look so bad  Here's another  Well that's correct  Did that actually happen?  Well yes  You see  When you're doing this  You're concentrating  On  You're totally concentrating  On your shooting  And there's a very limited  Amount of things 
[02:01:00]  That happen  When I actually said  For example  On my videotape  I saw the number four  In the upper right hand corner  Of my mind  I actually  When the adrenaline hits  I had four vertical bars  And after I shot  The first guy  The first one disappeared  When I shot the second one  The second bar disappeared  You actually saw this  In the upper right hand  Corner of your mind  You have a little  Because all you're trying  What you do is  In a situation like that  You try to get  As many as you 
[02:01:30]  As many as you can  As quickly as you can  You know I was saying  On the tape  Speed is everything  Speed is everything  And the count  You have to  You have to  Have your targets  Pre-identified  How did you know  That it was a threat  At that time  How did you  Absolutely know  That they were going  To harm you  In some way  Okay well because  I was very familiar  With the streets  Of New York  At the time  I had a lucrative job  I worked less than  Half the year  And the rest of the time  I was spending my time 
[02:02:00]  On the streets of New York  Mostly stoned  All over the city  I considered  The whole  The city  All the city  To be my city  With the exception  Of Harlem  And that's  When I was in my 20's  Because I went up to Harlem  With some guys  From Washington Square Park  We used to hang out with  And we went up there  One weekend night  For a card game  And we played cards  For a few hours  And then on the way back  We were threatened twice  On the way back  Just walking maybe  Two blocks  Yeah  At the subway  It was the 125th street 
[02:02:30]  You know  And that  Now maybe  Maybe a little more  Than that  Maybe three blocks  You know but  So I decided  Not to go in Harlem  But anyway  I was familiar  With the streets  I had been mugged  Once before  And then people  Had attempted  To mug me previously  Is that why  You went out  And got a gun  Well  That's why  I was carrying a gun  At that time  I carried  I had owned  And carried  You know  Anyway  I had had guns  Previously in my life  And basically 
[02:03:00]  I realized  That  These guys from Brooklyn  Are very tough  I mean the craziest  People in this city  I feel  Come from Brooklyn  And oh yeah  Yeah  And oh  They're dangerous  But anyway  There are people  Out  Most of the majority  Of people out there  Could out fight me  Even then  I was a good  Physical specimen  If there are people  Who are interested  In fighting  Like if  You can't out fight 
[02:03:30]  These guys  You can forget  Any one of them  You will be killed  Can kick your butt  Any one of them  Can kick your butt  And they fight  They fight  Hard and dirty  Even  Okay but anyway  So  Not wanting to be a  You know  Have to learn karate  Like your security guy  Out there  Master Paul  Right right  I just  You know  It's easier to carry a gun  Absolutely  And that's it  I gotta agree with you  And it's a shame  To say that  Because back then  Back then  That was a  That was a very 
[02:04:00]  Reasonable conclusion  I feel New York City  Is so much safer today  Basically I hardly  Ever carry a gun  It was a little crazy  Back in the day  You still carry them  No no  Your guard asked me  If I was armed  I said no no  No  But do you have a permit  To carry a weapon  No  No  No permits in New York  New York City  Doesn't really  Don't give out  Doesn't want to give out  Permits  Very difficult  Of course they always say  You know  One guy told me  Once in the park  He said  A friend told me  That he  He needed two things 
[02:04:30]  To get a gun  And he said  First he needed  A piece of paper  And the second  Is he needed a gun  You know  So  Yeah  It's very hard  In New York City  To get a gun  That's right  The people like  The policy here  So many people  Like it  And what can you do  You know  85% of the people  In the city  Voted for carry  And I don't know  If you agree with it  Or not  But it's  You know  It tells you something  I mean  You know  I don't really  I'm not too pleased  With that  I'm not too pleased  With the political  Representation  That we sent  To Washington  I'm a little 
[02:05:00]  Embarrassed by them  And  You don't like Hillary  Well  I think  I think it's stupid  That if you have  An existing  Administration in power  That let's say  If  And I'm not  This is not even  A moral question  But if  If let's say  The Republicans  Are controlling  The federal government  Why do you send  Them their competition  Why do you elect  Democrats as their competition  It's going to be  That much harder  For them to get money  And help  From the federal government  Right  I didn't like  Al D'Amato  But people say  If he had been  If he had been 
[02:05:30]  Re-elected  Instead of  Schumer  That  New York  Over the course  Of his six year term  Would have gotten  New York state companies  Would have gotten  Probably about  Five billion dollars  More in federal contracts  And  That would have been  You know  He was head of  The Ways and Means Committee  New York  You know  Shoots itself  In the foot a lot  They did with  That nuclear plant  That was shut down  Several years ago  Five billion dollars  Something like that  The public  You know  Winds up paying for that 
[02:06:00]  You're running for mayor?  In the next election  I want to run for mayor  I don't expect  To be elected  But I think  That's a way  Of influencing  Society  In New York  Government  New York's very lucky  New York City  In some ways  The public  Is very lucky  The politics  In the city  Is basically  Mostly septic  And I  At the same time  Just because  Of the law  The way of the  New York State law 
[02:06:30]  Is the New York City  Charter is written  Almost all the power  In city government  Is in one person  It's in the mayor's office  And it's kind of simple  In New York City  The mayor  Doesn't really have  The right to do  The budget anymore  But he  Even though he  Has a great say  On it  He hires and fires  Everybody in the city  The mayor of New York  Has a lot more power  Than just mayors  Of any other city  In the country  It seems  They really do  And he appoints  Basically appoints  Almost everybody 
[02:07:00]  The schools commissioner  Has a lot of say  In many things  One of the problems  I feel  That we have right now  With subway  With the train financing  In New York City  Is too much of it  The MTA is controlled  By the state  Apparently  I think that  Something like  The subways and buses  In New York City  Should be controlled  Mostly by city politics  Do you consider yourself  More a democrat  Or republican  Neither  What I'm going to say now  This doesn't reflect  On national republicans  Or democrats  It's the way I see  Democrats and republicans 
[02:07:30]  In New York City  I think the democrats  All the big name  Democrats in the city  Let's say running for mayor  And again I feel  The power  The main political issue  In New York City  Is the mayor's office  All the big name  Democrats  Play the race card  And I basically  I think very poorly  Of all of them  And that whether it's  You look at all the candidates  That they had running for mayor  And I'll even name  Even the better names  Of them  That I think they were all  Basically a bunch of bums  They'll play the race card 
[02:08:00]  Do rabble rousing  The republicans  In New York generally  And I'll tell you  How very good  Comes out of this  The republicans  Are even worse  I was at one of those  Republican fundraisers  Where I got invited  By various groups  And I saw what went on  And after the whole thing  Was over  That's where people buy  Five thousand dollar  Tables for people  And afterwards  Some people offered me  A ride home  And they said  But I need to talk 
[02:08:30]  To some guys  Up in a hotel  Up in one of the  Conference rooms upstairs  And so they went up  It was actually a suite  It was in a conference room  And it was several  Of these guys  Sitting around talking  And all of it is  If you get this  Okay  I'm going to do this  For you  And if you get this  You're going to do this  For me  And not one thing  About what the public  Was about  It was basically  The republicans  In New York  Or at least  New York City  Are crooks  And how good  Comes out of this  Is with the democrats 
[02:09:00]  You get  You get real bad candidates  The republicans  Are in such bad shape  They don't have candidates  And so they have to  Give their  They give their  Candidacy  Lately  They've been giving it  To people outside  The party  Non-professional  Politicians  Now both  Rudy Giuliani  And you have  Mike Bloomberg  Were non-professional  Politicians  Rudy Giuliani  That was his first time  Running for office  He was a prosecutor  Before  The republicans  Really don't like him  But he was a  Non-professional  Politician  Very smart 
[02:09:30]  I don't like  Everything he did  He did a tremendous  Amount of good things  Well after 9-11  Before that  People were just  Angry with him  Here in the city  It's not the 9-11 thing  I'm saying before  The 9-11  Quality of life  Crime stuff  Well yeah that was  I think the worst thing  You get to squeeze  You guys off the street  He got rid of  Rudy Crew  Who was the  Schools Chancellor  And that was probably  The worst mistake  There was a little bit  Of a scandal going on  And the school system  Actually had made  Remarkable improvements  And the trend was upward 
[02:10:00]  And the guy had been  In charge for like  Five years  Or whatever it was  And he got rid of him  Because there was  Some negative publicity  In the papers  That things in the school system  Were bad  But if you look at  The real statistics  And that's unfudged statistics  The thing  There had actually been  Very significant improvement  Over the years  And you can't do change  In the school system  Overnight  For example  If there's someone  In the 11th grade  If their third grade  Education isn't right  It'll be screwed up  Every year after that 
[02:10:30]  If they don't learn  How to read and write  Correctly  Anyway  We'll see what happens  If you get elected  I'm not going to get elected  But what I want to do  At least you know  That it would probably  Be a pretty slim chance  I don't think  Well that's not  That's not the issue  You see  Why are you running  In the last mayor's  Oh sure I'll get into that  But just so you know  In the last mayor's election  There were 26 people  26 people wanted to run  Only 10 of them  Got on the ballot  And I had a web page  A page on my web page 
[02:11:00]  Where I listed  Everyone else's website  So you could just go to that  And you could click on here  For Alan Hevesy's website  Mark Green  Dick Brodeur  All kinds of other names  You heard  Peter Valone  And anyway  Mike Bloomberg  Who I almost voted for  But anyway  There's things that I think  You sure like to talk Bernie  I gotta tell you  You certainly enjoy talking  Well if you  If there are  If there are things  That you  That you want 
[02:11:30]  That are worth talking about  I understand  But I mean  You love  You are all over the place  I think making the world  A better place  Is important  Absolutely  People are alive now  There isn't enough of it  I agree  But you know what it is  I think  I think like a magnifying glass  You gotta focus a little more  You're kinda  Kinda all over the place  Okay well why don't we talk about  On a couple issues  Why don't we talk about  Either  Ground zero  Or vegetarianism  Cruelty in life  One of those two 
[02:12:00]  Or what a subject  I like both those subjects  Ground zero  I like the idea  That you want new towers  Not in the footprints  But to preserve  A lot of people  A lot of people  Feel the same way  We would rather have  The buildings back  To their full size  But you know  You gotta think  As Jimmy Norton  Was saying earlier  It would be very hard  To fill those  Top floors  Would companies  No not at all  Not at all  As a matter of fact  If you look at the plans  He says  One of the options  Is even have a zoning variance  That the upper floors 
[02:12:30]  Would be luxury housing  By the way  How about only Saudis  Can rent out the upper floors  No no  But also  In terms of the upper floors  In terms of the upper floors  Not just like the old towers  But in this plan  At least  Both towers  Would have major  Public places  Observatories  And restaurants  What the guy  Is proposing here  This is a professional plan  And this was done  With professional architects  And  It's a modern version 
[02:13:00]  It's a 2000 year version  Of the buildings  It looks very similar  In fact  They're significantly  Different buildings  The wall strength  Is between  Ten to five times stronger  This building  Is actually designed  To take jumbo jet hits  But  While looking better  And it's very similar  To the old  World Trade Center  Except the windows  Are much wider  The old  World Trade Center  Had rather narrow windows  And didn't these plans  Say columnless space  Like the old ones  Like  Isn't that a problem  Like  Would the stairwells  Be in the same places  Or no  No  Well this plan 
[02:13:30]  He calls for six stairwells  Instead of the four  They're also  There'd be one  Emergency elevator  Just devoted  To things like fire  More importantly  The building  Has major  Fire  Retardation system  The old building  Basically had nothing  With this  You'd have  On the roof  Where you have  Your water tower  You'd have  On each building  Would have  A similar sized tank  Which would be  Full of fire suppressant  Probably actually  Aircraft foam  You could put out anything  So you have the choice  In the building  Of putting out 
[02:14:00]  Using fire  Water suppressant  Each building  Itself  Unaided  Could suppress  A jumbo  Jets that they  Haven't designed yet  Okay  But they're planning  On making jets  Three times the size  So has anybody  Been given this  Type of a plan  Or you know  Pretty much going  Forward with what  They've proposed  Which is that spike thing  Right  Well this is somewhat  The problem is  Yes it's a freedom tower  And these should be built  Instead of the freedom tower  If they don't want to  Build on the memorials  That works beautifully  With this plan 
[02:14:30]  They can have  They can have  The existing memorials  The way they want them  They can have things  Like the Arad memorials  Which are somewhat  Like waterfalls  And what they're  Trying to do there  By the way  Is make  Make a  Terrible  To make a memorial  Into an artsy  Kind of place  And they have  Good architects  They'll probably  Do a good job  On it  I personally think  The memorials here  That on this particular  Plan are superior  But this plan  Will work with  Their  With the  Officially  Approved  Memorials  Or the  Suggested  Memorials 
[02:15:00]  Is this going to be  Part of your  Platform  Well it is now  We've been trying  To draw attention  To it  Because  Well  You see  They've got about  Six or seven months  They're still doing  Garage work there  By the way  If a lot of your  Listeners have computers  Let me plug a website  Here  For this  No  For this  And they can listen  On and get on  The website  And see what  It is  And we can talk  About it on the air  We've done this before  And the public  If you have  I don't know  I don't know  What your audience is  But I'll say  The website name  A few times 
[02:15:30]  It's  Make  N-Y  N-Y  Again  Dot com  I'll repeat that  I'll spell it out  The word  Make  M-A-K-E  N-Y  Repeat it  N-Y  Twice  N-Y  So N-Y  Wait  Make  N-Y  N-Y  Okay  So wait  It's make  N-Y  You're interrupting  Andy  You're screwing up  You're screwing up  No no no  Because people are  Make N-Y  N-Y  Again dot com

[02:16:30]  N-Y  N-Y  Dot  Ah  Ouch  Okay  That's  It's worth it  Look  Guys have tried this  On the computer already  And people can call in  Who have logged in  On their computer  This works out good  If you have a computer here  Why don't one of you guys  Try to lock on it  You want gunfire  I got a question for Bernie  They do that on the radio a lot  Of course  I wanted to ask you about this  Should we tell gun stories  And ignore  We could infuriate  The rules for a while  I saw  I saw part of that  That awful Ron Cooby  When they  Disgustingly 
[02:17:00]  What 43 million  They want you to pay KB  What did you say  There was something about  Ron Cooby  Which you should  Should be spit on  Said something about  Daryl KB's  Dreams and ambitions  I didn't  I didn't hear that  And you responded  Something about how  You don't think of the dreams  Of someone who's attacking you  I don't  Do you remember  Oh no  I could have said  I don't recall  But there could have been  Things like that  You see for example  People said  You should have been  Thinking about his mother  And this and that  You know  What kind of crap is that  Like should  If you're  If 
[02:17:30]  When  A rape victim  Or something  Or when someone  If someone  Hits you on the  Head with a pipe  You know  On the street  Are they thinking about  Your mother  How your mother  Is going to react  I mean  There's a lot of baloney  Defending yourself  People know how  These animals  Travel in these packs  Well they  There was much more  Of it back then  Of course there was  When Dinkins was in office  Oof  Crime running rampant  Sure  James Ramzura  One of the guys  Who was involved in that 
[02:18:00]  Was arrested for raping  An eight month pregnant woman  On a rooftop  After it happened  They were all bad guys  No she was like  Three months pregnant  I thought it was eight  Oh well that's fine man  You know what  It must have been  It must have been a three  And then put like three together  That's fine then  Yeah but he raped  The pregnant woman  On a rooftop  It was awful  You see  And like in terms of violence  People  What is this?  What kind of show 
[02:18:30]  We get these  I was saying  It doesn't take much  To get you guys off  But Jesus  This is what they said  This is awful  Hunting sucks  Right  Opie turn that down  Turn that down  Turn that down  Opie what happened  Now there's a couple things  Yes  Not only  Okay I didn't realize  That you guys were 
[02:19:00]  That's horrible  Before I said you were  Near the edge  I realized you're over the edge  That's okay  Actually our listeners  Sometimes send in  Offensive songs  That we  Right  Right  But there's another thing  On there  Like he talked about  Down there in the south  He's hunting  And all that stuff  Yeah  I think hunting sucks  You're not into  Meat eaters  Well  I think meat eating  Is  There's  Hunting and meat eating  Are two separate things  I think meat eating  Is not so hot  Well hunting  But I think hunting  Is even worse  Hunting  Most hunting  Is worse  He's the coons 
[02:19:30]  Of course  And we've done  Declared a war  Look  You've got to turn this off  Until they sees  That weed is the best  What's that?  Weed is the best?  God damn  Right  Okay turn that down  I want to talk  Turn that  Andy turn it down  I want to talk  Opie  I want to talk about  Something  Opie please  I want to talk  About a line  Let's Bernie talk  I heard something 
[02:20:00]  Or I thought  I heard something  And he said there  Like weed is the best  And one of the lesser  One of the lesser things  I'm interested in  On my platform  Is legalizing drugs  All drugs?  Well  Ah  That's the issue  Because now  You said before  That you were a pot smoker  You liked the pot  Okay  Well what I'm talking  About though  Is  Right  I'll talk about  Two separate things  What I believe  And what I think  Should be done  At the same time  And what I think  Should be  Yes  At the same time  What I believe  And what should be done  Officially 
[02:20:30]  And what should be done  Officially  Which are two separate things  Okay  Well  With  With drugs  Most  My personal beliefs  After having  Been around all kinds  Of people who drugs  And I'm saying  A lot of drugs  Are negative  But my philosophy  Is people are responsible  For their own lives  And stuff  But anyway  My philosophy  The most knowledgeable people  Will you turn that down  Is somebody  Somebody handcuff this guy  Handcuff  Okay 
[02:21:00]  Get the security guy  Out there  To hand  Tie him up  Oh jeez  I'm sorry  Okay  Wait a second  Legalizing  People want to have fun  I understand that  And that's good  That's a good thing  But just a quick thing  On legalizing drugs  The most knowledgeable people say 
[02:21:30]  Don't try legalizing  All of them  Including  You know  Just try as an experiment first  Pot  Legalizing pot  I think a lot of people  Are for that  And then  Let me look at the others  And yes  In terms of legalizing pot  The mayor's office  Actually does have influence  On that  And that's  The mayor  Cannot make any of the laws  In New York  And it's an administrative job  Again  He basically  But did he make  The cigarette law  Oh sure  It shows you the power  Of the mayor  If you have a mayor  Who doesn't like people smoking  He can really make it hard  And it's the same thing 
[02:22:00]  With a blight of pot  And that is  The mayor has a lot to say  You are no good  You are a fucking asshole  What is this  You are a real jerk  Can you  You are a miserable creep  What is it  What's he talking about  Kill Whitey  Kill Whitey  Kill Whitey  That is awful  Kill Whitey  Opie  Opie  What happened  You are full of shit  Mr. Guest is speaking  About legalizing pot 
[02:22:30]  Let's try to be honest  It's a song for Bernie  No  Kill Whitey  Isn't the proper  Opie  Opie  Turn it down  It doesn't add  Opie  It doesn't add to the show  Right  If you want to play  Wait  You want some good rock and roll  Play some good rock and roll  Great  If you want to come up  With some good rock and roll songs  Once in a while  That's a  Come on  Alright  Let's take a vote  Should we get him thrown out of here  There's one  Wait  How many are sitting at the table  Five 
[02:23:00]  One  Two  Three  Four  Five  Well I'm with you  I'm sure  Okay  So that's two  Not that we're going to enforce it  But just an opinion  It won't be enforced  Just an opinion  Who would rather have him out of the room  I'm going to raise my own hand  I raised my hand too  You lunatic  Oh yes  So like  The mayor has a say on how laws get enforced  What are we talking about now  I would probably  Well for example  With the police commissioner of New York  If I were the mayor  I'd keep the existing police commissioner 
[02:23:30]  I think he's very good  But say you know  Turn this down a little Opie  Huh  Thank you  I talked to him about  You know  Continuing policies  Like being hard  I'm a squeegee man  I'm basically you know  A no nonsense guy  Well that's obvious  But  But  But look at  You know  Try to look at a few things differently  What party  Which is  Which is  One being  Power naps  For all city workers  Including cops  And then the other one being  How the laws on marijuana  Are enforced  Legalize pot  And sleeping  Almost all 
[02:24:00]  Right  Right  Well  That's good  Almost all laws  Are enforced  By local law enforcement  If you get busted  For anything  In New York City  It's going to be  Whether it's pot  Or speeding  Or who knows what  It's going to be  By local cops  Legalizing pot  And sleeping  As a mandate  I think  I think you'd be attracting  The same people you shot  No  No  No  No  No  And as  Experiment  As an experimental policy  Anything you do  If it doesn't work  You know  Then you  Then you  Then you stop doing it  But that  I think that would attract 
[02:24:30]  All kinds of good people  I think  I think alcohol  Is a pretty strong drug  It absolutely is  Violence is committed  To strong chemicals  Than pot  I did not  He did it again  He did it again  No  They claim  To be wild Indians  Stop  Another vote  Another vote  What happened  Oh my god  Is there any reason  You're playing  These offensive songs  You know what I think  Either  You should  I do one of two things  You can  Yes  Change  Listen to a little 
[02:25:00]  Good music  Get your head  In a different place  Or  Take a  Go outside  Take a toke  Or take a tranquilizer  Take a tranquilizer  What kind of rock and roll  Do you like  You said good rock and roll  What kind of music  Do you like  What is  Funny you should say that  Bernie just handed this  This song to me  What song did Bernie  Oh you son of a bitch  No you really did  What is this  Nice  America  America  For white  Africa  For black  Send those 
[02:25:30]  A pack  To the tree  Ship those  Nickers  Back  Bring that  Bell  To  God  Oh my  Oh baby  Oh baby  Oh baby  Oh baby  Oh baby  Oh baby  Oh baby  Oh baby  Oh baby  Okay  This has got to be  The last time  Wait  Turn it down  Turn it down  Wait  Wait a second  Wait a second  Wait a second  Let's do the following  Let's take a vote  Again  Just to see  Who would like  To see that stop  Not that  Let's see who  Votes for it  We'd like to see  It stop  I'm going to raise  My hand 
[02:26:00]  I would like  To see it  Okay Ben  What is your position  Everybody's voting  To stop it  Ben's position  On the floor  Passed out  Normally  Oh baby  Oh baby  Oh baby  Oh baby  Everybody has voted  And forget about  That cheap cop out  About voting one way  Or another  For you  That's right  Okay now that  Everybody's expressed  Your opinion  Will you stop it  Will you stop it  Alright I'm sorry  Mr. Getz  See  Now if you want  To play some music  You like  I just was trying to  Make you feel at home  At home where  At home  At where  In Alabama 
[02:26:30]  The deep south  Right  He's from Manhattan  I'm sorry sir  And you know  You can talk to people  It's funny  You didn't answer  What kind of music  You like  What kind of rock and roll  Do you like  I haven't listened to it  For a long long time  Really  Because since I  I had a squirrel  Died years ago  Oh we read about  Your squirrel  I think  I think that  Treatment with animals  Are the way how people  Treat animals  And relate to animals  Is very important  In the world  The way how people  Relate to other people  Is very important  In the world  Now you're a vegetarian  Yeah I think  I think that's  Important  Would you consider it 
[02:27:00]  A vegan  Do you have any  Kind of animal product  No I'm  No I'm not a vegan  I'm a lacto-ovo  And by the way  Lacto-ovo  Lacto-ovo  Even though basically  I've cut way back  On milk lately  And I've cut back  On eggs  But I found  That when I went  I originally  Well I did an experiment  By the way  And this would work  For most of the people  Out there  And it's an experiment  That I think is worth  Doing in your life  It's not that  Just like  I personally think  For a lot of people  Experimenting with  Smoking pot  At least you know 
[02:27:30]  Once or twice  Is a good thing  But this is an experiment  With vegetarianism  And don't even  Become a vegetarian  But one of the  Directors once  Of the NRA  Used an expression  He said about  My incident  The subway incident  That it advanced  Civilization  I thought  Yeah  Who is that  Wayne LaPierre  No I don't want  To give the guy's name  And no  No it was one of  Their intellectuals  Not one of  Not one of the high  Not one of the 
[02:28:00]  High profile  Get your hands  Off me  Daryl  Cabe  Oh  Jesus  Anyway  Anyway  I thought  He's got a  Screwdriver  And it's sharpened  No I never said that  He didn't  Wait  Did he have a  Screwdriver  Wait  They  Well they didn't  Show  They were carrying  Them but they  Didn't show  They didn't  Brandish  Screwdriver  Four is enough  For me  You see  Being surrounded  You know  They didn't know  I was carrying  A weapon  But anyway  I thought it  Would advance  Civilization  If people  Would eat 
[02:28:30]  Less meat  Not stop  Eating meat  But just eat  Less meat  Are you surprised  That they were  Talking and  Wearing clothes  Surprise Charlton  Heston  No no no  No that's not  He doesn't feel  That way  In fact I saw  That movie by  That real fat  Guy who did  Those  Those movies  That were  Steve C  Anti  Anti  NRA  And then he  Did something  About Iraq  That got  Michael Moore  What do you  Think of  Michael Moore  I think he's  A jerk  I think he  Exploits  He accuses  People of  Exploiting  And he 
[02:29:00]  Himself  Exploits  Yes he does  Right  And he  Sets people  Up  And he  Edits his  Videos  To make it  Look like  Something  Happened  He's a  Filmmaker  Not a  Documentary  Maker  It's a  Bunch  Of bunk  He'd be a  Good example  To be a  Vegetarian  Because he  Would influence  A lot of  People  It was  BS  I saw  Them set  Up  Charlton  Heston  This movie  On Columbine  By the way  Columbine  They did  A cop  Out on  That  Columbine  I feel  The root  Cause of  Columbine  Was  Bullying 
[02:29:30]  And  They didn't  Want to  Bring that  Out in  The media  By the  Way  I also  Think  That if  Kids in  School  Were  Vegetarian  You'd  Find  The  Vegetarians  Would  Be  Doing  A lot  Less  Bullying  Statistically  Than  The  Non  Vegetarians  Wouldn't  That be  Nice  If  It  Was  Like  The  Peas  And  Carrots  Mafia  Instead  Of  The  Veggie  Mafia  Well  I  Think  That  Would  Be  A  Step  In  The  Right  Direction  But  But  I  I'm  Not  Going  To  Say  It  Would  Solve  All  The  World's  Problems  You  Think  Eating  Meat  Enrages  People  A bunch  Of  High school  Students 
[02:30:00]  Football  Players  Would  Rape  A  Retarded  Girl  With  Carrots  If  You're  A  Meat  Eater  And  You  Actually  Cut  Back  On  Eating  Meat  For  A  Period  Of  Time  Typically  Typically  A  Year  Other  Hormones  And  Things  Will  Start  Flowing  More  In  Fact  You  Might  Even  Become  More  Animalistic  Temporarily  Really  Yes  Yes  But  But  There's  A lot  To  Be  Said  You  Can  Get  Everything  From  Plants  And  Vegetables  And  Things  Like  That  Milk  Works

[02:33:00]  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  Thousands  Of  Hours  Of  Professional  Police  Work  Locate  Doing  Bullet  Trajectories  On  The  People  Sure  A  Dent  Of  The  Bullet  In  The  Wall  Where  Bullet  Pieces  Were  Found  And  Stuff  In  In  In  Terms  Of  Feeling  I  Was  Kind  Of  In  A  Rush  When  I  Was  Going  To  The  Subway  That 
[02:33:30]  Day  I  Was  A  Little  Bit  Late  I  Said  I  Was  Going  To  Be  There  Earlier  I  Was  Going  Downtown  To  Have  A  Drink  With  Some  Friends  And  So  I  Was  Rather  You  Just  In  A rush  And  When  I  Got  To  The  Subway  Station  On  14th  Street  Which  Is  A  Block  And  A  Half  From  My  Apartment  Building  Did  You  Take  The  Gun  With  You  All  The  Time  At  That  Time  Yes  I  Carried  A  Gun  For  About  A  Year  And  A  Half  Prior  To  That  Where  Did  You  Keep  It  In  My  Waist  Band  In  Your  Waist  Band  Yeah  Cool  And  So  When  I  Walked  Out  I  Put  My  Money  In  The  Turn  Style  And  We  Didn't  Have  The  Cards  Then  And  I  Went 
[02:34:00]  In  The  Subway  Train  And  I  Was  Relieved  As  I  Was  Walking  Down  The  Steps  Because  I  Saw  A  Young  Woman  Lean  Over  The  Platform  In  The  Way  The  Direction  The  Train  Was  Coming  And  A  Smile  Came  On  When  It  Where  It  Stops  There  Is  A  Door  Actually  The  Closer  Door  It  Was  A  Little  Bit  On  My  Left  There  Was  A  Door  To  A  Car  That  I  Was  Originally  Going  To  Go  In  But  It  Was  Packed 
[02:34:30]  People  Were  Standing  In  So  Instead  I  Went  I  Looked  On  The  Right  And  The  Car  The  Car  Was  Half  Full  It  Wasn't  Even  Half  Full  Now  Why  People  Were  Afraid  To  There's  One  I'm  Willing  I  Sit  In  Front  Of  But  The  Other  Three  Are  On  My  Right  Were  Were  They  Were  They  Eyeballing  You  Well  Like  Right  Away  They  Were  Playing  Around  With  Each  Other  And  Stuff  But 
[02:35:00]  I  Guess  I  Don't  Know  What  What  They  Were  I  Guess  Some  Of  Were  But  Anyway  As  Soon  As  I  Sit  Down  One  Of  The  Guys  He  Was  He  He  Looks  At  He  Says  Well  You  See  How  You  I  I  I  Knew  I  Knew  I  Was  Getting off on the main stop and stuff by the way and I didn't realize this for about six or seven or eight months later when I saw the guy's picture was thinking but I may have met that same group of guys before like on the sea not at the library right no no no no no no on one of the other subway lines in downtown Manhattan but they were with a group of five and they were younger it had to do with the baseball camp I think one of the guys whatever but any anyway and I just you know I didn't pay any attention to him really 
[02:35:30]  You didn't answer him back like fine or I think I said right right I just said fine and looked down and just because I figured I was going to be out of there at the next stop right one express stop which is a longer ride than one thanks I guess that's pretty but anyway um uh within a few seconds he stood up and then one of the other guys he stood up and came over to my left and simultaneously one of the other guys came over to my left and I'm still sitting and I'm still sitting got two over to your left right and the other two are where the two are on my right 
[02:36:00]  all right they were they had like stopped their play housing stuff and stuff like this now they were they were different times well they were just you know goof you know they were now other people are in the car that's correct and are they are they is anyone looking at this situation seeing that maybe something's developing well yeah people were aware of some people were aware of it that they did glance like oh this poor son of a bitch there was another guy there was another guy who was sitting my memory is and this I don't think this was ever confirmed in court or anything but there was another guy who was originally sitting 
[02:36:30]  sitting on their side who also came over and sat on my side right in the beginning before this even happened and he he uh uh uh a number of people didn't turn themselves didn't talk afterwards because about half the people on the subway car by the way came forward but of the people who came forward they said yeah there were you know there were there were 15 others of us on the car right maybe more but anyway all right so now they got you on the left and the right you're sitting in your seat right and uh the guy on my right just casually uh says and he sticks out he says give me five dollars 
[02:37:00]  give me five dollars right and i you see i kind of knew in my own mind i said as soon as i was surrounded i said oh shit he didn't have to say anything right but i said that that's you know and what actually was uh happening at that time and i didn't really realize it uh it was an adrenaline rush but you know you talked about feelings and stuff and uh you uh it's the same type of feeling if there's a scary situation people respond in different ways uh the biggest 
[02:37:30]  response respond is paralysis uh some people uh some people then there's a lot of flights some people fight and uh it's the same feeling you might uh you start feel a little bit warm you can even be weak in your in your lower extremities that's the beginning of adrenaline that's the beginning of adrenaline so when and and you actually feel a type of warmth rising in your neck filling up when did you realize that oh my god i'm gonna have to pull this gun out did it oh that that was as soon as i was surrounded i i i i figured the gun was 
[02:38:00]  the gun was going to come out okay it doesn't uh what exactly was going on and as soon as that happened i i uh uh my mind is pretty fast mathematically now i had never done practiced on scenarios shooting multiple guys i mean but but it just i just said from left to right and i was i was going to try to get as many as i could and so you just decided left to right not the guy that was talking or this guy first that's right now it turns out the guy who was talking was on the left but right left to right was the only way the guys on the right were all 
[02:38:30]  so further away were you sitting when you pulled it out no no what i what i so i i said what you say and he just casually said give me five dollars and he was you know he was he was smiling and i said i'll i'll give you five dollars and i and i stood up like like i was reaching for my wallet and uh i uh took out the gun and as i was taking it out pulling the trigger as it's coming out got him in the chest then the second i went over to the now did they say or anything after the first shot rang out was there an oh shit 
[02:39:00]  let me let me explain what happens that gun by the way it was a 38 it had it had a only a regular load in it well the first two loads were regular loads so the next three were plus p's okay but that gun i'd never plus p for people that uh right right well i'll tell you about well background about all the details of the bullets well that really don't need we don't need that no no no no no focus bernie okay we want this we want the action-packed action movie version okay but you talked about the sound and stuff 
[02:39:30]  yeah when the first shot went off i don't know if you've that was a gun cleaning a barrel because i had never fired it and you know what it's like when a gun cleans a barrel people first thought the reports were i'd been shooting a 44 magnum everybody basically in the car it's gonna be loud in a subway car too you lose your sense of hearing two women fainted outright you you actually your vision changes and you lose your sense of hearing you don't feel the gun all you're trying to do your hand your eye your mind and gun are the one and you just 
[02:40:00]  want to bring bring that trigger you want to bring the hammer down as quickly as you can on each of your you want to keep it loud scare away any pain in the ass innocent bystanders well it turns out right after right the first loud shot forget it everybody's got everybody's gone it was scared stiffy right kid well i mean what happened i don't know what the other people doing i heard while this was going on there was like a little high pitched 
[02:40:30]  it was like a screeching of a subway wheels or but it wasn't the train was it might have been people screaming in the background what i was told later is everybody while this was going on was boogying out of the car of course okay out of the other on the other side of the car was going out of the other direction this was on the north side of the car and everybody else in the middle of the car all right so you're now the first guy okay then the second shot and i'm not bragging that was a real good shot that guy was super fast 
[02:41:00]  oh yeah well i'll tell you about who was moving who wasn't i brought the hammer down on him and that was it was amazing that i got him and uh after that came the plus p's and i was pulling the trigger and spinning around to get the third guy but the third guy was much farther away uh-huh then the fourth guy who was fourth guy was in the corner daryl cavey so instead i tried to get him 
[02:41:30]  because that bullet hit the subway wall put a big dent in it broke into two pieces one piece fell straight down and another piece came back and it either hit me or a woman in the car but it was moving at very low velocity the piece that came back was moving slower than a baseball you know but the uh the fan slower than a face so you hit first shot hit second shot missed your third shot right fourth shot i got daryl cavey and by the way i misrepresented stuff on the videotape he he was previously standing but he was sitting in the seat why was he sitting what is he an idiot 
[02:42:00]  well no what's he gonna do he was he was trapped in a he was trapped in a corner did he think okay you might not have noticed him just sitting there i'm just waiting for the subway right i got him with i got him with a third shot you know boom and then i pulled the trigger swing i'm pulling the trigger swing over and the fourth guy was right there so i i got him right away so i got i got off five shots and i did it i did that that was pretty good shooting by the way five shots and how much time i fit max 1.5 1.6 seconds you could do it you could do it five shots and they're still alive 
[02:42:30]  well it's funny curtis lee while i was listening to him he was shot five times and they said with plus p bullets and he lived yeah he lived i mean how how is that in a cab a couple times we're in a i mean boy talk about uh the right reaction and stuff like that he got away from them now that they figured they got him and so you took a couple were in the legs they shot once in the leg and now now now now you walk up to cavey yeah oh yeah oh yes oh i didn't i didn't get it i gotta get to that right okay all right this is all happening 
[02:43:00]  pretty quickly yeah you know and so i scan my eyes around are they moaning groaning saying anything that you remember laying there bleeding no you're you're by the way your hearing isn't where i'll tell you your hearing comes back to you but it comes back in a whoosh it comes back fast when the when uh you're in a different state of mind  oh by by okay so with kb okay after i got the the the last guy what you do in a situation like this you don't be moving around like crazy and stuff everyone else was lying still 
[02:43:30]  the women's reaction was fainting which is an interesting react to women then and were there any other people left on the train any innocent bystanders that were left or they all i don't i don't i think they were all gone but then i don't know i don't know i wasn't i wasn't even looking at them i wasn't even looking at them so you walk up okay and i go up to him and i he was trying to move all around everything i realized later he was paralyzed by that time but what he was doing and he was a strong guy with his right hands he was trying to get out of the seat or something he was moving around 
[02:44:00]  uh-huh and i just boom you go for him like honey for the bee so there are thoughts in my mind this guy isn't screwed up enough and maybe you know what i and i well no no no you just pull the trigger on him i didn't think the guy was hurt  did you shoot him a second time or no well i aimed it right at his belly in fact well i aimed it to the i aimed to the right hand side like a little a couple inches right of his belly button and pulled the trigger why didn't you go for the fatal the chest or the head shot  i wasn't wanting to kill him i was just if guys like i'd been beaten up and i uh whatever and i figure 
[02:44:30]  you know you fuck each of them up good and that's it you don't want to kill him maybe the right but it  turns out probably it would have been better to kill him i don't know but anyway but anyway that's the way  it was then and then after that well we don't know about hearing i started looking around and i saw two women  and uh i started looking at them for a while i couldn't figure out what happened because i thought there  were six people shot because you're trying to count bodies bodies bullets and everything you can't do  it and and you can't do it at the time i did you would hit an innocent bystander that really would 
[02:45:00]  have uh but i didn't no i didn't it's amazing well well the the the uh uh uh uh no it's not amazing  it's not amazing what is amazing is how bad some of these new yorkers shoot these new york the city cops  i mean one of them shot himself in the finger how do you i don't know what the mayor's going to do about  taking other people's shooting who wants to be the mayor of this city who would nuts like i want  you know anyway have you been you haven't been mugged since then have you i read that that is not  okay i said who would that would be a really bad move no why i i would people recognize you what 
[02:45:30]  kind of reaction you get on the street do you get a hey how you doing you get an angry reaction  mixed black and white well okay unfortunately you do get angry reactions you get about you get about  uh um it's lately it's running like you know uh  uh forty to one positive but but it's still you know you have negative people scream shout yell act like  idiots and and and you have a you have a society that's been uh partially brainwashed 
[02:46:00]  again you had the courts of new york the top they read they spent lots of time rewriting the law  of new york that every every shot is going to be judged individually and that was based on the  presumption that kb was shot a second time when the shooting was over okay with the words you don't  look too bad here's another that in fact didn't happen all the shots went off in terms of knowing  about people shooting you don't even have your sense my sense of hearing didn't come back until i saw  the two women just and it comes back well so your vision comes back somewhat to normal so you would 
[02:46:30]  have to and and you have a judge of new york the judge who wrote it he got arrested for blackmail  and this and that he was in prison and he actually fit he was faking his own injuries he was so scared  like he cut himself and the other inmates attacked me because he just wanted to be out of there and  you have this guy who knew nothing about combat and people's reactions because you would have had to  judge the guy that was being shot as he's running away as a separate incident from uh the initial  reason you shot now there's all kinds of different ways of shooting and also when things go you know 
[02:47:00]  it takes a lot to want to pull the trigger down on one person once you have once you have once you  reach the state where you're willing to pull the trigger on one person then any basically anything  goes it's things will happen to you i don't some guys in co who have experienced combat understand it  i i uh uh it it's it's uh uh so you have there was just a lot of ignorance and a tremendous amount of  wasted energy and effort in new york let me ask you something my prosecution not only did it cost 
[02:47:30]  two million but it caused racial resentment in new york but i think it did help the politics  you spent it gave us al sharp you spent a year in jail for the gun charge eight months eight months  in jail all you were charged with was uh well carrying that's that's a felony you know right there  there is a concept like the authority of the law and they didn't you know and because it was a high  publicity case one of the reasons also they had to send me to jail and it was uh we didn't want it  at the time but it went down during my trial when i was on trial for shooting the guys one of the guys 
[02:48:00]  who testified uh one of the rapist guy he was screaming and yelling f you with the judge and f you  slotnick tormented potty mouth yeah well yeah well we play dirty with him what what happens slotnick is  an extraordinarily good attorney and and well let me correct this he's very good but he has a good  team behind him too and stuff now i want you to understand we didn't play lots of dirty tricks in  that trial but we played some we played about four five the da was playing a major dirty trick every 
[02:48:30]  day a real low thing so uh we had found out that james rams or in rikers was uh was uh on tranquilizers  a lot of guys in rikers aren't tranquilizers maybe uh i would maybe 10 10 10 15 percent oh they don't  even like giving them out well what in my section maybe 10 10 well different people have different  medications that's kind of what i wanted to ask you about you again we must focus bernie oh we must  focus but okay but anyway i wanted to you know we wanted to conduct some type of interview if you 
[02:49:00]  just go off believe me you will you tend to really go on these tangents you know you're like yeah i would  say the subject matter for you are like four black guys standing in front of you you hit one you're  on the other you hit one's running off and you're going back to another one you're all over the place  well the case has you didn't describe that well enough so you go back to that one it has to be  done in detail if things if things are going to be explained you might as well do it in a way that 
[02:49:30]  people can i'm not saying everyone can follow this right they do a recording of this and and by the  way people said the cnn interview that i did a few days ago that was aired a few days ago that that was  good and the reason it was good is a guy heard it on satellite radio he doesn't he doesn't he  wasn't he doesn't actually watch tv listens to satellite radio and he said the questions and  everything were were real the way how it went you know and the fact that that that there are pictures  of two people a man and a woman talking or something like that that doesn't really add to the  conversation have you ever seen these guys again except for the kb civil court in court i saw them in 
[02:50:00]  the criminal in the in the criminal court okay but anyway here's why i had to go to jail  just so you briefly understand not only for the authority of the law but when james rims were in  court flipped out and everything and he used that he was telling the judge f you and i i misspoke on  that program i said there was 30 of the world press there that's probably wasn't true but there was  when he was there there might have been tangent 12 15 but okay but anyway he got it right you're  correct he got sentenced to six months he got sentenced to six months for that 30 days for every time he  told the judge f you okay so he got six months for that and when they gave him a sentence 
[02:50:30]  see uh the only person who has a criminal record as a result of that of that incident was me but  when they sent him to jail for contempt of court telling f you to the judge right they basically  had to send me to jail on the gun charge yeah well you had to figure now i want to i want to ask you  about jail uh were you in the general population over at rikers no fortunately i was for two months  i was for two months in uh the hospital section of of rikers that's where they keep people like 
[02:51:00]  larry davis uh the high publicity cops right larry davis and something like something like that  right then they then they uh uh that's totally different from general how are you i spent i  spent six months in the brooklyn house of detention that was most six and a half months actually wow now  how are you treated by uh some of the people were there black people that would uh mingle with you  it's mostly black right it's it's it's mostly black there uh were there taunts being yelled out and  well a few people uh here and there uh rikers was different than i hear uh rikers right now is 
[02:51:30]  run by one of the gangs i think it's the bloods really yeah yeah that it's it's they they they're  about 5 000 of the population and rikers is the bloods they and they run everything it's they even  have blood uh officers and blood captains if you and if you if you if one of them beats the crap out of  you and stuff like that if you report it uh you'll then they'll really beat the crap out of you and  nothing will happen in either case how were the guards to you and the cops did they treat you 
[02:52:00]  well oh definitely the guards and rikers were pretty good and everything i mean we didn't get  stuff like uh uh i heard that uh a few years before when i was in there some uh connected people were  were in there and uh they were even being their food was brought every day on trays from the  you know but anyway uh jail sucks by the way but we did have pot and and and we had some and we had  pot in jail absolutely we had some well we were i was lucky but not not often we might have some 
[02:52:30]  real good pot maybe maybe four times a week one i mean uh and i'd be with you get some real good  pot it would only take you maybe a quarter of a joint maybe a third of a joint to get you off good  good stuff huh yeah wow you didn't seem like the type that smoked pot i had to pay and then well  the media kind of presented you as this uh geeky computer guy you know what is a geek well at the  time at the time i didn't even own a computer now i think using the internet is a wonderful thing 
[02:53:00]  oh yeah oh by the way you play video games no play any shooters no but i'd love to i i just play  grand theft auto i i i would you would love it i once had one of these machines you were driving  around car fast fast this night i did movie theater i'd love to have one of those but anyway that's  maybe in another time i would love to hook up a playstation and have bernie getz play uh maybe  we can uh go into the office okay maybe jfk game where you actually recreate shooting uh yeah you  recreate i know obviously it's a bummer but it's it's kind of a scientific approach that they're 
[02:53:30]  taking the motorcade makes its way around you are oswald in the uh book depository and you have  to take the shot and see if you could actually recreate what happened uh back then and i don't know  i don't want to do but i but some type of other game maybe that i have a very odd theory about the  jfk assassination but i know this is gonna sound crazy but i don't think oswald um acted alone  that's that maybe you may be right by the way let me just wow wait let me just plug a website in

[02:55:00]  mr thompson good morning hi keenan how are you i'm good how are you good thank you good good good  good you're starring in uh fat albert that's right of course we all remember fat albert that's kids on  the the cartoon that's right uh now you're starring as him you know who we have in this in the studio  with us who do you remember bernie getz bernie guest bernie getz bernard getz he was back in back in  like 1980 what was it 84 84 84 he was that's the 20th anniversary that was that was the guy in the 
[02:55:30]  in the subway who shot who shot four guys in 84 by the way are your own feelings on that and be honest  now do you think that was somewhat racial i don't really even remember that story actually i was like  six years old oh okay well forget it okay anyway okay i assumed he would have known i thought he was  older right bernie you're a has-been what happened definitely where were you raised uh keenan i'm  from atlanta georgia okay so it might not have been as big a story down there yeah all right well tell 
[02:56:00]  us a little bit about sorry about that i shouldn't have brought up the subject was to discuss things  i thought that's fine it's a legit question that's uh okay okay tell us a little bit about how it is  working with the cars oh it was unbelievable working with bill cosby you know what i mean i've looked  up to him like all my life really yeah and uh just to be able to work with him and become his friend  and bring his fat albert character life it was really unbelievable what's the gist of the story  do you come out of the tv or something yeah i come popping out of the tv because this girl is like  having problems at school and she's crying while she's watching the fat albert show and he can feel 
[02:56:30]  it so he comes popping out of the tv to see what's wrong with her yeah and then uh fat albert has to do  what try to work his way back into the tv or find bill cosby or something well he's supposed to go  back in the tv but he ends up like really falling in love with the new world and also falling in  love with uh that girl's foster sister too so it's like his first time dealing with love and dealing  with you know enjoying the new world and doesn't know if he wants to go back to the cartoon world so 
[02:57:00]  he goes to mr cosby's house to try to get some advice does he get his stomach stapled that'd be a good  plot line right yeah we might bring that up in the sequel or something you know what i think i think  the world isn't a cartoon world and i i think it should be oh yes yeah it should be yes bernie  bernie gets speaking yeah there's grief out there and they're saying like if if there's if people  are feeling bad and they're crying there'd be a lot less of that if mankind or basically vegetarian  that's vegetarian now now fat albert is not a vegetarian i know right i know but i think he 
[02:57:30]  should here's what i would here's what i would experiment all right bernie okay if if i were if  i were him and actually anyone out there if you were who if you were who if i were him or if i were  him or anyone or a meat eater or or any other meat eater try an experiment for 30 days where you don't  give up meat or fish but you only try having do two things only try having meat or fish once every  three days yes only once every three days roughly now if your mother cooks her favorite dish if you break  you don't have to be super strict kenan but once every three days so it's ten times kenan call the 
[02:58:00]  cops for us shot four people we're gonna be in the subway kenan he's shot four people you guys in  danger right now he's shot four people in the subway i'm afraid these these these guys are a little  bit well they are anyway um if you have it once every three days for a month and just try it you  and you can quit it at that also there you go also second thing avoid food with hydrogenated  vegetable oils a lot a lot of american food has hydrogenated vegetable oils you do those two 
[02:58:30]  no but ken are you taking notes try having meat or fish once every three days okay yeah have you  ever asked somebody on the subway for five dollars okay and then don't and then that like say and  then at the end of that see if see if you like that lifestyle also do things like look for  veg look like think for things like soy milk no the silk silk soy milk very good if you're vegan  vegan enhanced silk soy milk and this can only get the weight down for someone like fat albert let's  say to bring this back to what we were doing well possibly oh hey kenan when is the film premiere we 
[02:59:00]  have to ask that oh right that has flax oh kenan when does the when does the movie open uh the movie  opens on saturday actually christmas day saturday very good uh a family movie you could take the  kids too and will all the fun characters be coming back like the you know he have a hobo guy and  yeah mush mouth is in the mush mouth that was it and they're all live all live action right yeah  all the characters come to life well that's pretty cool you had to put on a fat suit yeah i was wearing 
[02:59:30]  a hot little fat suit running around in the desert all summer long how hard was it to take a dump while  you were wearing that suit was it awful well i would have taken a dump on myself i didn't have an  opening like that but there's no zipper in the back yeah i had to zip up from the back and you know if i  wanted to pee or anything i had to take it all the way off bernie let's say a lovable character like  fat albert asked you for five dollars would you shoot him in the chest say he legitimately needed  right okay well he needed a twinkie well depends on you see it depends if the guy is a huge a lot 
[03:00:00]  depends every situation is different in the law by the way every case is judged differently so maybe  it would uh it would kind of be better if he just said hey give me five dollars and you wouldn't feel  so threat well no i mean look i've had i've had a you'd say hey hey hey you don't look so bad i i  may have had a gun out but i mean you can did you see that funny a gun itself doesn't have to be a  threat a car is a three thousand pound bullet you know i think what is it a woman mowed down a bunch 
[03:00:30]  of people downtown that was several years canaan without kidding she just ran right over i'm petrified  he shot four people so what in the subway but no no no it's not it's not that bad i'll tell you why  but but interesting just just so you know so because you were too young and forget it turns out  that the reason i asked you about that question everything yeah i was white the guys were black but  after my case within a few years after my case there were at least two cases where where a similar 
[03:01:00]  thing happened where a black guy shot three other black guys yeah and it was like nothing in the  media there'd be a little story on like page two or three of the new york times a little bit in the  daily news and one of the other papers wouldn't even carry it yeah and what do you attribute that to  uh bernie well um i don't know exactly some people some people say it was a slow news day  some people uh say say it was the combination of just being before christmas and a lot of people 
[03:01:30]  were together and able to talk about a subject in the media it did raise a lot of uh things also  it was the combination of the dramatic some people considered it dramatic that after the shooting  i ran away i ran i ran i ran down the subway tracks and ran to a subway station right and got away  basically i didn't turn myself in uh days later there was a mystique about the whole thing you were  the subway vigilante yeah but anyway i wanted you to know that the thing was i was i was interested in  public we talked about public perception did you like watching fat albert growing up bernie 
[03:02:00]  what did you ever watch fat albert growing up a little bit here and there i hardly ever watch  television i basically uh with with uh my squirrel we watch mostly the cooking shows yeah i've seen  maybe a hundred times yeah keenan um bernie has a pet squirrel whatever well but the squirrel died  and it was a big story no no no no no no that's where i didn't get back but let's say i've had  other squirrels oh you've had other squirrels yes yes where do you find your squirrels  squirrels are uh rated as in new york city they've been rated as vermin and they're available 
[03:02:30]  uh in the parks because squirrels you're getting this keenan you see yeah no no lots of squirrels  in the park guy who are mothers you see a squirrel squirrels if you have a squirrel as a pet they can  live 10 years 10 years they can live 10 years but out in the city parks aren't they vicious and  bite you they live three uh no i heard that they were they were very they're very likely to bite  because i've always wanted to pet one of the little fellas maybe do this no if you try to  if you try to pick up a wild squirrel you're likely to get bit that's what i was about just to give  a little chin pickle anyway so you get no you should it varies with a squirrel varies on the 
[03:03:00]  circumstance you have to give a squirrel time to know you their natural would be fear oh keenan's uh  i gotta go yeah okay i figured on keenan christmas day uh we do appreciate you calling it fat albert  is premiering what all over the country right yes saturday uh christmas day christmas day go check  it out and thank you keenan could you maybe call back another time when we uh aren't we're not talking  about death yeah we're more in control when we're uh not being held hostage show this is a family movie

Tie your shoes nice and tight because ACC basketball is breaking you down.  You better box your man out because we're grabbing the boards.  Round ball, baby.  It's the ACC today on XM Satellite Radio.  Cut off the ricochet. 
[03:11:30]  It's Thursday, the 23rd of December 2004.  I'm Ari Bikowski with the ACC today.  ACC basketball season has been hot.  How about that action on Tuesday?  Let's begin with UNC.  They hosted Vermont.  Rashad and Sean May.  Now Felden frontcourt.  Drops it to the trailing McCants.  Working left wing in front of the Vermont bench.  Now long outside shot.  Bottom.  Oh my goodness.  Good three steps behind the arc.  Rashad McCants with only three points in the win on Sunday at Blacksburg. 
[03:12:00]  Makes it 14-3.  Down inside.  Ball lost.  Recovered Jawad Williams.  Started back to the deck.  Well, it lost it.  But May recovers and dunks it.  The Tar Heel Radio Network, a division of Learfield Sports there on the call.  UNC just put this one in hyperdrive.  They smoked Vermont 93-65.  Led by Sean Mays, 20 points.  How about the Wolfpack?  They're looking to bounce back from a loss against Washington.  Well, NC State this time had BYU.  Pack lead is down to nine. 
[03:12:30]  Here's that.  So we're feeding the post to Collins.  Swings it left side to Bethel for three.  Swish out of the left corner.  Big basket by Tony Bethel after BYU had cut the lead to nine on a fast break layup by Austin Ains.  Wolfpack Radio Network on that call.  Herb Zendek's crew, they take out the Cougars, 72-61.  In other ACC action, Florida State shows some prowess over Jacksonville, winning 101-57.  Clemson loses to UAB in the outrigger Rainbow Classic, 78-66. 
[03:13:00]  And that's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.  It's the XM Radio Ski and Snow Report.  Hi, I'm John Davis, brought to you by Steamboat Colorado.  Come see why folks have coined Steamboat the land of the free, home of the brave,  and playground of the red-blooded powderhounds.  Visit Steamboat.com.  Our mountains continue to add terrain towards the big holiday weekend.  Breckenridge in Colorado with 110-plus trails. 
[03:13:30]  The Half Pipe and Terrain Park open at Aspen Mountain in Colorado.  67 runs like Ruthie's Run for a recommended trail.  Into Utah, where the canyons with five bowl areas and almost 90% of the mountain open.  Deer Valley has some fresh snow and almost 70 trails.  Five of their six bowls are ready.  Mount Batchelor in Oregon with 50 runs.  Squaw Valley USA in Lake Tahoe, 150 trails.  All runs now open.  On the eastern side, a little warmer the next couple of days.  Sunday River with over 80 runs in Maine.  While Bretton Woods in New Hampshire, over half of their trails are open. 
[03:14:00]  In the Poconos, Camelback's ready with four runs night skiing by Sunday.  Sugar Mountain, North Carolina, they're ready with half of their trails like Easy Street for beginners.  I'm John Davis with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  It's the O&A virus.  XM 202.  XM News, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything, all the time.  O&M and the show.  XM 202.  XM 202.  Night  Merry Christmas, all and all a good night. 
[03:14:30]  Merry Christmas, all and all a good night.  Merry Christmas, all and all a good night.  Merry Christmas, all and all a good night.  For Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stering, not even a mob.  All the stockings were armed, Father Tim and he would care.  And hope that Saint Nicholas was to me there.  Merry Christmas, all and all a good night.  Okay, terrific. 
[03:15:00]  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  I want my toot on! 
[03:15:30]  All right, we get it.  Jesus, who the hell is that?  What?  That's all right.  What was that?  Oh, that's Gary Hoey, too?  Really? 
[03:16:00]  I thought it was a couple of the brothers.  Gary Hoey and Daryl Cabe.  Well, that was a weird hour.  Holy jeez.  Hour.  That was hysterical.  I love him.  Is he still here?  Oh, yes.  Still with Steve.  Oh, he's in with Steve?  He's cutting 40-minute liners.  Wouldn't it be funny if all of a sudden we look out and Steve is shot in the studio and Bernie's running away?  I think he wanted to shoot me, actually.  Just when it got really uncomfortable and I'm like, he's going to walk out of here, he would just start to laugh. 
[03:16:30]  He'd start laughing.  And that's what made it really uncomfortable.  Like, oh, wow.  Jesus.  All right.  Unbelievable.  How great was that, though?  Fat Albert and Bernie Getz on the phone together.  Where else are you going to hear that, folks?  Talking about vegetarians.  The world is like a cartoon.  God, it was just poetry.  Oh, my God.  That was just really weird.  Hats off to Ben.  Good job, Ben.  Boy, as nutty as a fruitcake.  I love it. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, Ben just started talking to the guy online or something, right?  Yeah, I found him.  You found him online?  We happen to actually live very close to each other, which is very scary.  Yeah, no, I found him.  Too many wasn't around when you got mugged.  Yeah, no shit, right?  Outside the thing.  Where was he when you needed him?  Yeah, exactly.  Where's Bernie Getz when you need him?  That would be fun to ride the subway with him, wouldn't it?  Oh, yeah.  He asked for $5.  Just watch people's faces when he walks on the subway.  That'd be fun.  All right.  Now we got to regroup.  No, I'm going to have a tangle with him again, though.  Nope.  That's right.  You never know.  Got all the literature in front of me. 
[03:17:30]  He's rattling those papers off.  I know.  Did he fanned them out perfectly?  He had OCD.  It was very obvious.  He wants to come back closer to the election as well.  Jim was talking to him.  Yeah, I'm like, we'd love to have you back.  How can you not?  Absolutely.  You got to see the picture I took with him.  What did you do?  I just gave a look of fear.  I made a gun hand with my fingers.  I put my arm around him and it repulsed him.  You know how awful it is to repulse a man who shot for the humans?  I really am a zilch.  What's going on? 
[03:18:00]  You got it?  What do you got?  Speak.  Oh, you got our photo?  He's inside doing IDs now for the show.  But he's going on and on.  Steve was getting all upset.  It's like, Steve, this is good stuff.  Is he still?  Please just say the things that we want you to say.  You want to say, hi, this is Bernie Goetz and you're listening to Ovi and Anthony or  something like that?  And what's he going like?  Hi, it's Bernie Goetz and you should drink milk and silk milk.  Oh, yeah, Ovi and Anthony.  Anthony, your brother Joe sent us in and it's the last day we can play because we're going 
[03:18:30]  We're stepping aside for what?  We're stepping aside for a couple of days for Christmas.  So everybody have a herky-jerky Christmas.  Have a herky-jerky Christmas  Like you work for O&A  Eat a dish of some bad fish  Just like old gravy legs  Have a herky-jerky Christmas 
[03:19:00]  Comb your hair with a car bomb  Then exclaim, that's nuts insane  With your big, fat, meaty heart  Huff and puff  You breathe too much  And buzzin' like a bee  Run around like you're strung out  On crystal methadrine  Have a herky-jerky Christmas  And in case you didn't hear 
[03:19:30]  Be like Ben and have a herky-jerky Christmas  This year  Merry Christmas everyone, Merry Christmas  Merry Christmas  From the ONA family, Merry Christmas to you and yours 
[03:20:00]  We are so distracted, we just want to get out of here for a couple days  It's so obvious at this point, huh?  Big Hev is handing out Christmas gifts, Anthony, to everybody.  This is my favorite time of year is to open the presents.  Oh, I got one, too.  Ooh.  Wow, that's a big one.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Look at us.  It looks like cologne.  It's not cologne.  Oh, something from Brookstone.  Oh, very nice.  Thank you, sweetie.  There you go, Jim.  Oh.  Bloody Sunday. 
[03:20:30]  What did you get, Anthony?  What did you get?  What did you get?  It was great.  Some big, huge framed...  Wow.  Look at that.  That's an original quarter sheet.  Wow.  King of Comedy Movie Poster.  Nice.  Very nice.  That is fantastic.  Thank you, Kev.  Merry Christmas.  Proudly displayed in the new home.  The new Kumya household.  Yes.  Of course.  Very nice.  That is beautiful.  You have to get Steve in here.  Yeah, I know.  I got the...  That's great.  A Brookstone wine opener, right? 
[03:21:00]  Bottle opener?  Yes.  Very nice.  Thank you so much.  I know you like your wine, Opie.  Usually alone.  Sometimes with a man in pajamas and the fire department.  Eric.  There you go.  A java log.  You should have...  Oh, even Eric.  Oh, our owner got a present from Big Kev.  Hmm.  Very nice.  Jimmy, what did you get?  A film called Bloody Sunday.  Yeah, so you can stop thinking that it was ripped off.  It's about...  It's about a reach.  It's about a Sabbath song?  Yeah, it must be. 
[03:21:30]  I don't think so.  Steve, Merry Christmas.  Oh.  You didn't put a lot of thought into Jimmy's Gift, did you?  I certainly did.  What's that movie about?  It's about Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  I'm always trashing you for it.  Okay, but is it a good movie?  I don't even know.  It's a very good movie, yeah.  All right.  And, Steve, was that a fire extinguisher?  I don't know.  It says Brookstone on it.  It's a martini maker.  Is it real?  Oh!  Whoa!  Very nice.  That's actually pretty cool.  How joyous.  All right, what's Bernie doing? 
[03:22:00]  Thank you, Kevin.  I'm touched on it.  What is Bernie doing?  Bring Bernie back in.  Bring him back in.  Bernie!  Look at that.  That's very nice.  Thank you.  A flask?  It's got two flasks.  How you doing, Bernie?  A shaker.  Bernie, are you having a problem out there?  We saw you, like, wandering around.  You all right?  Yeah, I put my jacket and my umbrella out there somewhere, and I don't know where it is.  Somebody made the judgment error of stealing from you.  We're going to turn the lights off.  Where is Bernie's stuff?  Well, I think they want to...  Oh, there it is.  I think they want to sell it on eBay. 
[03:22:30]  Eric's got it.  Yeah, eBay is...  That's something else.  eBay is something else?  Yeah, definitely.  Will you come back again?  Will you come back again?  Certainly.  All right, good.  Maybe we...  But, you see, like, if they want to laugh, you guys will have to do it.  I can talk about good subjects, though, if you want.  No, we do.  You know, at a good level.  No, people really enjoyed your segment.  Next time we have you on, we'll, you know, closer to the election, maybe.  And then...  Okay.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I can tell you all about New York politics.  I know how the system works.  Of course.  You know, again, the Republicans and Democrats in New York really suck, and the Republicans 
[03:23:00]  are so bad, you wind up getting...  They get people outside the party, like Giuliani or Bloomberg or Schwarzenegger, even in California.  Schwarzenegger's better than what they had before.  Ben Sparks in Florida.  Oh, Ben Sparks with his herky-jerky platform.  Yeah.  Steve Carleese.  They burned it.  More forest fires platform.  They burned my coat.  Do you like black people?  It varies on the black person.  Yeah.  Do I like Swirls?  Just like anybody else.  Do I like white people?  Just like anything else, right?  Some of them are good, some are bad. 
[03:23:30]  You seem to be obsessed with the black people, though.  No, yes, because you don't go to Harlem anymore.  No, no, I suspect that's more coming from your own mind.  No, I'm asking.  Because you're the...  No, no, no.  The New York City did have a black crime problem years ago.  It turns out in the 50s, the crime was 50% white, 50% black.  But we got them under control now, right, Bernie?  We have crime under control, and by the time my incident happened in the mid-80s, the street  crime was probably 98% black.  Wow.  So people could easily, you know, look at it as racial.  You brought that percentage down a little bit, though. 
[03:24:00]  It helped start.  Like I said, you know, the city changed.  I didn't think the city could change, but it changed.  Right.  It changed.  But it did.  It's because of the economy, though, Bernie, right?  The economy goes up, but there's less crime, no?  No, no, no.  Giuliani.  No, it's a lot more than that.  There are several big factors.  Right.  AIDS was a big factor.  Oh, look at that.  We found your code in an umbrella.  AIDS got rid of some of the riffraff?  Yes.  Definitely.  And then you had the big crackdown on crime really worked.  Yep.  Stopping the revolving door justice policy helped a lot. 
[03:24:30]  Are you saying that AIDS had a good reaction, like something good came of AIDS?  Definitely.  I think people change.  If there were black people doing crime, I think they've grown somewhat as a people, you know?  Right.  And so I think the world is different.  New York does have less street crime, and it makes the world, New York, a much better  place.  Thank God for AIDS.  Let me ask you a question.  Not that New York is a good place.  New York is a cold, it's a town based on money.  After the shooting, did a lot of chicks want to bang you because of who you were? 
[03:25:00]  You had to have gotten laid a lot.  A number, but I was too whacked out and everything.  I was overwhelmed with problems to really take care of it.  You know, you had the press all over the place, you had people screaming for your neck, people  trying to make you a hero.  You know, I didn't know how to handle that.  Yeah.  I, uh...  Did you get some white supremacist groups calling you up and saying, good job, boy, that  was a...  You done good.  But, you see, I thought when I turned myself in that I could deal with the legal authority,  straighten it all out, and I had no idea.  There's his umbrella and coat. 
[03:25:30]  The media.  Oh, is that a hint?  There it...  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  We just didn't want you to think it was stolen, is there?  So a couple of chicks would hit on you once in a while and you...  Whatever, whatever, whatever.  Now, oh, now I'm interested in women.  I think I've blown it, though, with my life.  I've lost a lot of years.  You know, I'm an older guy.  I'm a younger, older guy in the sense that if you're a vegetarian, I think you hold up  better.  You do look young.  How old a guy are you, Frank?  I'm 57. 
[03:26:00]  57?  You don't look 57.  You look fantastic.  Well, thank you.  Thank you.  That's, and if you want to, if you don't want to...  Big hogs.  Well, you guys are both skinny, but if you don't want to get a beer belly, if you want  to, if you don't want to have digestive problems...  And your wife's to our own big calf.  Yes.  Try as an experiment, only having meat or fish once a day for a month, for the next 30 days.  Try having meat or fish just once a day.  Try avoid, and the second thing, try to avoid eating junk food.  Right.  Like the hydrogenated vegetable oil.  You can get a lot of good vegetarian stuff around there. 
[03:26:30]  Like, you know, there's a...  Hey, you got your own problem.  Also, I'm lacto-ovo.  If you want to eat eggs, because I found when I stopped eating eggs, my hair fell out.  Then when I went back to eating eggs, it came back.  Eggs made...  That's right.  Lack of eggs made your hair well.  Where'd it come back?  On your back?  I have flaxseed oil.  Flaxseed oil.  Well, not on the top of your head.  It doesn't do that.  Bernie, Dr. Phil said that if you quit eating one thing, you should replace it with another thing.  Like, if you quit eating one, then you should find a replacement for it.  Well, flaxseed oil in enhanced silk soy milk is the only product out there that has flaxseed oil. 
[03:27:00]  Flaxseed oil has the same amino acids that fish and stuff has.  All right.  And that will do the same thing as eggs.  By the way, if you're bald...  It's the only kind of flack he takes.  But if you're bald on top, like me, you see the short women can't see it, so they don't know.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, you see?  That's good.  But, I mean, I guess some people go crazy.  What can I take for my sinuses?  I have very bad sinuses.  They're ruining my life.  I'm always congested.  I would try two separate things.  I've tried prostitution if it doesn't work.  No, no, no, no. 
[03:27:30]  Two things.  You may, if you have some type of viral infection or an antihistamine, like just a...  I believe if you have colds and things like that...  I think a bullet between the eyes would cure that.  It would open those sinuses right up.  That takes a BHT tablet if you think it's...  If you have some type of bacterial or viral thing, BHT, once every three days for a couple  days.  Is that over the counter?  Or, yes, it's in the health food store, BHT, a food preservative.  Some, a few health stores can have it.  Delivered with a snub-nosed revolver.  Also, try a cheap antihistamine, the regular antihistamines with the, what's the chemical? 
[03:28:00]  The chloroferines.  How about you try the door?  You know, you get about, you know, I didn't bring any with me, but they sell them right  in the right...  I'm going downstairs afterwards.  Dr. Goetz.  If you want to stop in the Rite Aid.  Dr. Goetz.  And they, you know, you're supposed to take max six a day, but first...  Oh, you're going to Rite Aid?  Take four of them.  Black people, stay out of Rite Aid for a few minutes.  Anyway, anyone...  I take...  Any store downstairs will stop.  Did you have any histamines?  Kill my erection.  I can't take any...  Shut up!  They do. 
[03:28:30]  They kill my erections.  I just...  Shut up!  Jimmy likes prostitutes, Bernie.  I love them.  Well...  That's how he gets laid.  Something tells me Bernie might have paid a time or two.  Sure.  Bernie, have you ever paid...  If it doesn't hurt anybody, I think...  Have you paid for a prostitute?  Have you ever given a chick some money?  You know what they say about prostitution?  They say...  Oh, boy.  Sidney Biddle Barrows, who was...  You know, she used to be...  Madam, she said, if you can give it away for free, why can't you sell it?  It's a good point.  Yeah, sure.  Have you ever gotten one?  Oh, I don't talk about my sex life. 
[03:29:00]  Oh.  Or lack of it.  Oh.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  You should be getting laid all the time.  I should be.  You're right.  Well, you know...  We've got to get a stripper up here someday for Bernie.  Anyone can be a jerk.  That'd be good.  No, no, no.  Stripper isn't my type.  I don't mind either, but...  You've got a nice girl.  Hold on.  Sally has something to say on the line really fast before Bernie...  Can he hear you?  Hold on, Bernie.  Bernie, Sally from Illinois, go ahead.  I just...  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Sally, he's got to put his headphones on.  Yeah, hello.  There we go.  It wouldn't be possible to go to bed with Bernie because he couldn't shut up long enough  to swallow the Viagra. 
[03:29:30]  Oh.  Oh, Bernie.  She's saying you can't get it up anymore, Bernie.  Let me respond.  Oh, look at Bernie.  I've never...  No, no.  He's swaying back and forth.  He's getting into talking to Sally.  Spark-sized lump.  Well, I've never taken Viagra.  I have three pills at home, and I'm waiting for a special experience to try it.  Oh.  I like various drugs and this and that.  Lagras.  Well, I got...  Occasionally, if I want a sleeping pill, I got a pile of sleeping pills.  I take one every...  I take one about once every ten days or so.  I took one last night just to make sure... 
[03:30:00]  I took half of one last night to make sure I'd be up and awake for this show.  You should just record yourself and play that at night.  Oh, no.  No, I'd rather listen to the music than myself.  I hear you.  Bye.  Oh, bye-bye, Sally.  Sally was just, you know, goofing on you.  We got to get Bernie...  We got to get a nice girl here for Bernie next time he comes back.  That would be fine.  I'd like that, maybe.  You don't like strippers, though?  Like, they don't turn on a little bit?  I love them.  No, they may be good-looking.  I don't be great.  How about we get you a black girl?  Oh.  That's for the living. 
[03:30:30]  But there's a lot to be said.  Sex is a great thing.  Of course it is.  But there's also a lot to be said for companionship and things like that.  There's, you know, you can't live on...  On...  Just like, you know...  Sex alone?  Right, right.  A lot of things.  A lot of things.  And, I mean, but if there's nothing wrong, if you want to have, you know, sex without emotion,  that's great.  If you want to have emotion without sex, it's great.  If you want to combine the both.  You want to have, you're sure.  All right.  Could you sign your picture for me?  I would be honored to frame that in my apartment. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, well, okay.  Wow.  You signed many autographs, uh...  Rimes are banned.  You signed many autographs, Bernie?  There are no heroes.  What?  You signed many autographs?  Once in a while.  Once in a while.  I used to say no, but people just asked me.  Yeah.  And Lil' Jimmy is a big fan.  Oh, yeah.  You know.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Did you write anything special?  Like, bang?  Just Bernie gets...  Just Bernie gets...  Yeah.  Best?  You see, guys...  Thanks, Bernie.  ...are able to take out their aggression, uh, differently than women.  Of course.  In things like, you know, and it's a shame. 
[03:31:30]  It's, it's, uh, it's, uh, there are some, uh...  If you're getting laid back in the day, I don't think you would have shot those four  youths.  Yeah.  Youths.  Anyway.  Bernie, thank you so much.  You got your umbrella and your coat now?  I'm all set.  I got all...  All right.  We'll see you after the holiday.  Thanks for coming in.  Take care.  We'll, we'll keep in touch, and, uh, good luck to you.  Bye, Bernie.  Take care.  There he goes.  All right.  There goes Bernie.  In honor of Bernie, a quick song.  Everyone has AIDS!  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS! 
[03:32:00]  Say, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  Everyone has AIDS!  And so this is the end of our story.  And everyone is dead from AIDS.  It took from me my best friend.  My only true pal.  My only bright star.  He's not AIDS!  Well, I'm gonna march on Washington.  Lead the fight and charge the brigades.  There's a hero inside of all of us. 
[03:32:30]  I'll make them see everyone has AIDS.  My father, AIDS!  My sister, AIDS!  My uncle and my cousin and her best friend.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  The gays and the straights and the whites and the spades.  Everyone has AIDS!  My grandma and my dog go blue.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  The poop has got it and so do you.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  Come on everybody, we got quilting to do.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  We're gonna break down these barricades, everyone!  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS. 
[03:33:00]  This is Bernie Getz.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  All right.  We got an ID.  That was great.  People suggesting maybe a date.  Who and who?  Patty.  Right?  Imagine stalker Patty and Bernie going out for an evening. 
[03:33:30]  Him just rambling on and on and her rambling on and on.  They would just both be talking about just talking.  Not even hearing each other.  Not caring.  All right.  Babbling.  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good, all right.  Very good.  That guy went on way too long, first of all.  But anyway, hello, Care Bear.  Hi, sweetie.  Thanks for calling the program.  How are you?  I'm okay today.  I just want to wish you guys a Merry Christmas.  The show sounds like you have nothing left, you know, a day before vacation. 
[03:34:00]  So I figured the perfect time to say Merry Christmas.  And to all the whack baggers on that stupid fucking website, this is really me.  I have a screen name and they don't believe it's me.  So I want to tell them that that is really me who is posting under that name.  Now he needs his little bit of fame.  Look, you're already becoming affected.  No, it's not fame.  You were the Frenchie guy that we didn't have to worry about.  And now you're kind of getting caught up in the whole thing.  I don't think there's much to worry about.  But I post on the stupid message board and, you know, I just want to confirm that it's 
[03:34:30]  me and that's all.  You were the star of the show yesterday, by the way.  Very funny.  What did you say?  You were the star of the show.  Oh, did you like the call?  Yeah, you were great.  You were great.  I appreciate that, guys.  I try to only call when there's something good to say and that's how I do my business.  All right.  Okay, guys.  Have a good Christmas.  And, you know, that's it.  Care Bear.  Take care.  Okay?  All right, my angel.  Have a very safe and happy holiday.  All right.  So, yeah, that's whackbag.com.  Also, opianthony.net.  They feel like they're not getting enough plugs lately.  CringeHumor.net.  Is it .com or .net? 
[03:35:00]  They were .net.  They might be .com, too.  CringeHumor.net.  All the message boards and everything associated with the show is up on opianthony.com.  Wowfans.com.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my merchandise guy who sells my merchandise off.  Wowfans.com.  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, is that the guy that...  Oh, is that Paul?  Paul Field.  Yes.  Oh, Paul, yeah.  He's a sociopath.  The Bernie Getz of merchandising.  He is a kook.  Paul likes to send emails.  Yeah.  He's another one that likes to send a lot of emails.  I heard he's a little...  Is that the guy that's a little difficult to dine with? 
[03:35:30]  Well, we were in a sushi restaurant last night.  It was packed.  And I swear to God, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he goes, you know what I hate about  black people?  As loud as he can...  Jesus.  And my brother, who could deal with just about anything, is like, will you shut the fuck  up?  Oh, my God.  He's just...  He's a lot...  He's one of those guys...  There's an honesty to him, because he has no filter.  None.  Really?  He just doesn't get it?  None.  Sometimes you should keep your yap shut?  Absolutely.  As soon as the thought forms, there's never a contemplation of, should this come out of 
[03:36:00]  my mouth?  It just...  It just flies out.  It rolls out.  It rolls out like a sneeze in a miscarriage.  Before you can stop it, you know, there's all your plans on a linoleum.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Randy, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I'm a new listener.  All right.  Hey, good.  And I just want to say your show is great.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Did you start listening today?  No, I listened on the free play.  Okay, good.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm hooked.  Thank you.  Did you know who Bernie Getz was? 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, he's a bang-up.  He did a bang-up show, man.  I'll tell you what.  All right.  Thank you, Randy.  Thank you very much.  Merry Christmas, guys.  Take care, Randy.  Cool.  Let's go to Nashville and talk to Andy.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, good morning, everybody.  Morning.  Hey, I just wanted to say Merry Christmas to you guys.  And, yeah, you brought it up last week about putting up the nativity scenes to kind of  piss off all the Muslims and everybody.  I've been looking everywhere to buy nativity scenes.  Oh, yeah.  For me, my family, everybody, just put them up just to piss everybody off. 
[03:37:00]  Hey, good morning, little Jimmy.  Good morning, fella.  And I couldn't agree more.  Hey, man.  You were talking a few weeks back about your, you had a cyst at the bottom of your back?  Yes.  Oh, man.  Those things are horrible.  Do you know what that is?  Yes.  I had a doctor look at it while we were at YSP in Philly one time, and he said it was  nothing.  It was just a little bit of fatty tissue.  It has not gotten bigger.  It's nothing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Man, if it's a palinatal cyst, those things are the worst.  You can't walk.  You can't sit.  You can't stand.  It's great.  Oh, it doesn't hurt at all.  Not yet, but it will. 
[03:37:30]  It'll blow up and be really nasty.  And when it pops, that's the good stuff.  It's brown and slippery, nasty.  It smells worse than Voss's ear.  Oh, my God.  God.  I'm serious.  Disgusting.  Good to finally talk to you guys.  I'm punching out.  All right, Andy.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  One of those tailbone cysts.  You know...  No, it's off to the right, though.  It doesn't hurt.  Remember we were talking about Club Soda Kenny?  He's going to be on...  Well, he is on.  It debuted, I guess, last night.  Oh.  Oh, on HBO. 
[03:38:00]  Inside the NFL.  We got the audio of it.  I don't know if it'll make sense on the radio, but we could try.  Hey, Bernie didn't.  We put that on.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, Club Soda Kenny is dressed as a very, very, very tall elf.  Dressed like an elf.  Were there midgets in the scene?  Yeah.  Yeah, two midgets and Club Soda Kenny, all six, five of them, all in the same outfits,  tights, goofy little elf hats and stuff.  Kenny should have asked his co-starring midgets if they want to have sex with a porn star.  Not a bad idea.  We're still trying to get that done, right? 
[03:38:30]  Imagine sitting here in the studio and watching that happen.  And our friend Jim Florentine, he's doing this piece where he's Santa,  giving out gifts to some of the people in the NFL.  And Kenny's helping by making comments and stuff.  In his inimitable style.  Ridiculous.  Because he's retarded.  Yeah, so you want to try the audio, see if it works?  Eh, give it a listen.  Inside the NFL on HBO.  It's going to run all weekend long, obviously.  Okay?  Let's hear.  Oh, hey, guys.  Well, it's that time of the year again where we're getting ready for our big night, 
[03:39:00]  but we can't forget our friends in the NFL.  Hey, Clubby, where'd you get that snow cone from?  I made it outside.  The olive's my favorite flavor.  Andy Reid said he's going to wear tights if Torello and scores 15 touchdowns.  Well, he's going to need these then.  Eight-minute abs, an Atkins diet book, and let me see,  and a bra for his man boobs.  Speaking of T.O., check this out.  Concrete sneakers so he can stop those stupid dances in the end zone. 
[03:39:30]  Dude, it's a football game, not Saturday Night Fever.  I'm afraid to ask what this big box of tissues is for.  No, it's not for that.  It's for Dick Vermeule so he has something to cry in.  It's just a game.  I love the guy.  Let it go.  Oh, hi, Mrs. Claus.  Hi, boys.  Would any of you guys like to try some brownies?  No, no, no, no, no. 
[03:40:00]  Don't eat those.  Those are special brownies I made for Ricky Williams.  I also got him a subscription to High Times Magazine  and a game Monopoly so he could pretend he has money again.  Hey, boys.  Mistletoe.  Since most NFL players don't read in college,  I figured some would like to start now.  For Vinny Testaverde, I got him Keyshawn Johnson's book,  Just Give Me the Damn Ball.  And for Keyshawn Johnson, I got him Vinny Testaverde's new book,  I Can't Seem to Get You the Damn Ball. 
[03:40:30]  Santa, is this for the Giambi family?  No, we're doing baseball players tomorrow.  It's Botox.  So John Gruden can stop making those ridiculous faces.  You're a football coach, not Jim Carrey.  You're funny, Santa.  Hey, Santa, what's this lead pipe for?  Is Tanya Harding skating again?  No.  That's for Dan Marino.  Peyton Manning's knocking on the door.  Hey, Dan, two words for you.  Jeff Galooly. 
[03:41:00]  This is a special gift for Jamal Lewis for when he goes to prison.  Salt on a rope.  I hope he doesn't fumble this in the shower.  That's a good one, Santa.  Oh, that's so funny, Santa.  I can't believe that one.  We have time for one more gift.  This last gift is very special to me,  because I've known this player.  He's one of my favorite players.  What the hell's going on here?  Yeah, this is him.  And here's all the stolen merch from the mall. 
[03:41:30]  Take him out of here.  These mall Santas are all the same.  You better come with me.  What?  I'll see you guys in five to ten years.  Back to you guys.  Hey, wait, get me that soap on the rope.  I'm going to need that.  There you have it, Jim Florentine and Club Soda Kenny.  There are a couple of NFL gifts that Jim forgot,  and I am hurt and upset that he did not remember them.  Oh.  Oh, he forgot to mention a scope for Ray Carruth's rifle,  so she can't actually make the 911 call.  Sneakers for Daryl Stingley, 
[03:42:00]  and some better DNA for Doug Flutie.  Oh, my God.  With that, let's go to Club Soda Kenny.  Good morning, everyone.  Who, in my opinion, was the star of the piece.  Well, thank you very much.  You are my biggest fan.  Great job.  Stole the show.  And I am happy to hear that you survived Bernie Getz.  Oh, he was great.  Yeah, it was very compelling.  I was listening all morning.  You were, huh?  You had nothing better to do, obviously.  No, I'm actually preparing. 
[03:42:30]  I have a big day planned today.  Oh, really?  What's that?  Well, in a short time,  I'm going to meet with superstar Jim Norton,  and we will prepare for the event of the year,  which is at the downtown tonight.  In Farmingdale.  We're all going.  Oh, thank you.  It's going to be great to see you guys.  Yeah, we're all going to see Jim Norton tonight  at the downtown in Farmingdale.  Not many tickets available.  Now, there were 20 as of yesterday,  so we may be clean, as they say. 
[03:43:00]  It's clean.  Clean.  All right, Kenny.  That's the only thing that's going to be clean.  Ha ha.  Kenny, now.  Well, Kenny,  I just want to wish you a very Merry Christmas,  and you did a great job on HBO,  and we'll see you tonight, I guess, right?  Well, thank you.  I'm glad that you liked it,  because, you know,  you guys are an inspiration for me.  Very good.  All right.  I'll see you at 1130 this morning, Kenny.  Okay, sweetie.  Drive safe.  Okay, thank you.  Thank you.  See you later at the downtown. 
[03:43:30]  Bye, pumpkin.  Yeah, you'll see Kenny at the downtown  if you've got tickets for the show.  Yeah, I'm going right out after the show.  Earl, you missed Bernie Getz.  Why didn't you come in for Bernie Getz?  Yeah, Earl.  You should have come in for Bernie Getz.  I'm sorry, guys.  Wouldn't that be great,  having Bernie in here with a black gentleman?  All I wanted was to get a photo with Earl and Bernie.  I thought that would be hilarious,  but then people in Earl's community  probably would have been very upset with you.  You could have staged something where, you know,  he's handing you five bucks  and you're laughing about it, you know?  Or you have your hand out like you want it 
[03:44:00]  and he's reaching into his pants,  grabbing the gun.  Sure.  Holding a screwdriver.  And then he hears your Black Rock Coalition ID  and shoots himself.  Earl, how are you?  Can't hang with a comedian.  I'm not going to even try.  Where's your headphones, Earl?  All right, no big deal.  How is it over there at N.E.W.?  Quiet.  Hey, thanks for that tape, by the way. 
[03:44:30]  I did not.  I swear, as Christ is my witness,  I have nothing to do with that.  With what, the Frankie Blue tape  that you handed me personally?  No.  In the middle of the night when no one was looking?  You're an awful human being.  Earl had nothing to do with the Frankie Blue tape.  Of course not.  Aside from the fact that you ran the board, right?  Anthony, why are you winking as you say that?  I know.  What were you thinking as that was happening?  It was over.  That's all I was thinking.  Why didn't you say to him?  Did you say something like during commercial or something 
[03:45:00]  and say, hey, you know,  maybe you're a little too intoxicated to be on the air?  I have no response to that.  I have no comment.  No comment.  He's so shy.  He is a typical Viacom employee.  What are you going to do?  Cut your two out?  You're like Dana McClintock.  Bland douche.  Anything, Earl?  Can you contribute anything to this program  by telling us what was going on?  Absolutely nothing.  I got nothing.  You don't want to talk about it.  No.  The drunk. 
[03:45:30]  Was he indeed drunk?  No comment.  I got more info from Bernie Getz  than he shot for, guys.  Had he been drinking at the Christmas party?  Were you at the Christmas party?  There was a party earlier, yes.  And was he drinking at that party?  I don't know, quite honestly.  You don't know.  I honestly don't know.  No.  No, I think he was popping something.  What was the argument about between him and the...  That I don't know.  I swear to God.  Did she walk out crying?  I don't know that either.  What do you mean you'll tell us all the air?  No, I'm being honest. 
[03:46:00]  I don't know anything.  I'm telling you.  I isolate that.  I'm being honest.  I don't know anything.  Nothing.  No.  Don't know what the argument is about.  I have no idea what happened.  Okay.  You were in there.  You were working the board.  Who finally took him off the air?  I think he actually pulled himself.  Now stop.  You're not being honest.  No, I am being honest.  Why did he pull himself?  One minute he was there, one minute he was gone.  And that's all I know.  No one came in during that time?  No. 
[03:46:30]  It's not what we heard.  Did you ask Bernie for $5?  No?  No.  Why didn't you come in and meet Bernie Gets?  Do you have a personal problem with Bernie?  No, I don't.  Because he's not a black guy?  No, I don't.  Honestly, I think...  Four potential audience members of the Black Rock Coalition program?  No, honestly, my feelings on Bernie then were the same as they were...  You know what?  If they tried to rob him, they got what was coming to him.  All right.  All right.  Earl's taking a stand.  I'll say he is. 
[03:47:00]  What a controversial stand he's taking.  That's right.  All right.  Earl.  Don't give us any information on what happened with Frankie.  Earl, another great appearance.  Thank you.  Earl.  Great.  I heard Earl treated Opie finally to lunch or dinner, was it?  What was it?  Not really.  And Earl finally fessed up?  What'd you treat him to, Earl?  I didn't treat anybody.  You took up to dinner, didn't you?  No.  When I didn't have money, I was telling these guys.  So you had to like...  I coughed up some... 
[03:47:30]  I always offer money.  Always.  Always.  Always.  Prostitutes, maybe.  Always?  Yes.  I've never seen you offer money at any of the dinners.  It's usually everyone else digging in or someone pulling out a credit card.  I always put money on the...  Ben told me you had a burger and a bunch of sodas one day and just paid for the burger  without the tax or any of the sodas.  No, that's not...  I always overpay.  No, you're not.  No, not.  Come on. 
[03:48:00]  I'm not.  Okay.  Goodbye, everybody.  Goodbye, everybody.  Wait, Earl.  Oh, Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Come on, Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  He's black and Jewish.  Come on, Earl.  Sammy Davis.  I can't believe he walked out.  I can.  He's a good jawline, though.  That was a fast appearance for Earl.  I'll say.  And now this.  He's a good Jail. 
[03:48:30]  He's a good Jail.  Ah, there you have it, Anthony.  We just want to go home.  We're back?  Yeah, that was just a quick little thing.  Oh, we can't be selfish. 
[03:49:00]  Huh?  We can't be selfish.  We got to wait.  Wait until the show is over.  Yep.  What are you talking about?  There we go.  I was depending on Earl for some fascinating radio, and he walked out.  He actually left the studio.  Goodbye.  He's got his head down and everything.  Bye-bye.  I'm not coming in.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  No?  Yes.  Give us no information on the Frankie Blue situation.  Who's on the hotline?  It's another person from Fat Albert, but I didn't think he wanted to do it.  Uh-oh. 
[03:49:30]  All right, yeah, we'll talk.  All right.  What else are we going to do?  Daniel Ramirez.  Yeah.  Hi, how are you?  What?  Oh, good.  No.  Hopi.  You have to plunk it down.  Oh.  Well, why are they taking so long?  Danny.  Oh, all right.  Here we go.  Hello?  Hello.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, how are you?  Good.  How are you?  Good.  Waking up. 
[03:50:00]  I'm in L.A. time, so it's 6.45 here.  Oh, okay.  A little early, right?  It makes it sound sexy.  Yes.  So you're in the new Fat Albert movie, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  I play the character of Lori.  Lori, yes.  He's the girl he falls in love with.  Right.  Are you the one who comes out of the television to meet?  Well, actually, that's my baby sister.  Oh, okay.  He comes out of the television to help her because she's crying.  She has a problem.  She has, like, very low self-esteem.  She's not confident.  And then when he's out, then we meet because I live in the same house. 
[03:50:30]  And then you meet and you fall for him?  Yeah.  Well, he falls for me first.  Right.  And you just find him annoying?  Well, no.  No, no, not at all.  She finds him annoying, but I just, I really like his company.  He's genuinely a nice guy, so.  Yeah.  And she's not put off by his size, your character?  Well, see, the thing is, like, when he approaches me, he's so sincere and so honest. 
[03:51:00]  And my character, like, the problem that she has is that she grew up in a foster home.  Uh-huh.  So I was kind of like an autopsy because my parents were alcoholics.  So I don't have, like, I don't want to get close to anyone.  I have kind of like a fear of.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know where that came from.  Sorry.  That's okay.  So you, um, because Keenan called in, and he said that it was really hard for him to, 
[03:51:30]  like, relate because he didn't think that you liked him because he was so fat in the movie.  You know what?  Keenan is, the first day I met Keenan, I fell in love with him, so I don't know what  he's talking about.  No, no, just that he said that he thought that you, like, would only see fat when you  saw him, and it was kind of hard, he was saying, to do certain scenes just because  he felt that you were kind of judging him because he was so fat, and that there was something  with a director where you had said something about not wanting to work with somebody so  fat?  No.  I'm being honest.  I don't know anything.  Wow, that's what he was saying. 
[03:52:00]  No, he didn't say that.  He called in a little while ago.  He was actually very nice.  We were talking.  Yeah, he was really nice to him.  No.  No.  No, I didn't feel that way.  That's crazy.  Because we were just asking him pretty much questions about you.  Now, let me tell you something.  Because you're very attractive.  Oh, thank you.  Beautiful.  You're stunning.  You really are.  It's obvious you wouldn't go out with any fat guys.  Oh, that's not true.  No?  Well, see, the thing is, like, I have one thing that I have to have, and that's, like, 
[03:52:30]  you just have to be cool.  I think that's, well, for me, that's kind of, like, what I can relate to my character  about liking Fat Albert, because he's just cool.  His leg back is confident.  Fat Albert is cool?  He's confident.  You see what he wears?  Okay, you see, but you have to go see the movie.  That stupid red sweatshirt.  Have you seen the movie yet?  No, no.  It's not until Christmas.  You have to go see the movie, because the thing is...  Is it believable that you fall in love with the fat guy?  Well, the thing is, like, he's so cool. 
[03:53:00]  He really is.  It's like, and he's so confident.  To me, it's like, I think any girl really finds that attractive.  Yeah.  He doesn't care about his size.  He doesn't care that people are, like, looking at him.  Now, I know at the beginning, I think, when I first meet him, I'm kind of leery, like,  you know, what's going on?  I don't know what's going on with these guys.  But then it's like, you know, I see him at a party, and I see him, like, just at the  track meet, and he's just in different occasions.  Uh-huh.  At the track meet?  Yeah, he runs.  Fat Albert runs?  Not only does Fat Albert run, but Fat Albert, like... 
[03:53:30]  That's funny, actually.  I would love to see that.  Yeah, it is.  Fat Albert raps.  This is the new one in Pink Fat Albert.  I have a question for you, though.  Why does this film have an R rating?  Why does this what?  Have an R rating.  Why isn't it an R rating?  No, no, no.  Why does the film have an R rating?  It's rated R.  I'm saying, why is it rated R?  Too many kisses going on between Fat Albert and Laurie.  No, I'm kidding.  So what happens at the end?  You guys, I guess you don't want to give away the ending. 
[03:54:00]  I don't want to give away the ending.  I bet you fall in love with Fat Albert.  Let's just say that something happens between us.  I end up getting really upset, and then things kind of work out by the end, but the reality  of things, not everything can go my way.  You've worked a lot this year.  We're looking at your filmography.  You've had, obviously, a great year.  And in She Hates Me, it said you play the character of Alex Guerrero.  You played a lesbian.  How was that?  How was that?  Well, like, did you have any...  I haven't seen the film. 
[03:54:30]  Did you have to...  Did you do any, like, kissing with another girl?  Was that awkward or comfortable?  Oh, I wasn't awkward.  I'm an actress, so it was cool.  That must have been...  You know what?  I played against...  My girlfriend was played by Kerry Washington.  Who's that?  It was in Ray.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and she was just lovely.  She was lovely.  We all kind of got really comfortable with each other, but, you know, it's like as an  actor, you have to do certain things, and you just want to show range.  Like, I can do this, and then I can turn around and do something.  No, you're... 
[03:55:00]  It's actually...  I've done some acting, and it's very difficult.  I did a film with a guy, like, this guy, Ben Sparks, and he wanted it to be, like, a  gay thing.  I just couldn't go through with it and do it.  Really?  You couldn't do it?  Nah, I mean...  I know that's a limitation on my acting.  What's that?  Oh, yeah.  I was getting paid, but I just couldn't do it.  Hey, who were you in Buffy?  Oh, I was one of the potential slayers.  Really?  Yeah.  I think I saw those episodes.  Did you really?  Yeah.  I was in the final episodes before the show ended, and, yeah, I kicked some Budding Buffy. 
[03:55:30]  I like that.  I like that character.  How long have you been acting?  Because we've seen from a lot of stuff in 2003, 2004.  Did you just start, or did we only have a piece of your resume?  Well, you know, I think things that people really would recognize, I think, in the past  two years.  But I've been acting...  My first job was when I was 16, back in, like, 96.  I did...  I was in Subway Stories. 
[03:56:00]  I don't know if you remember that.  No.  Spike directed that, and Rosie Perez produced for HBO.  Yeah, no.  No, you didn't see that?  I was busy then.  You didn't catch that?  I like...  You need to catch up with my work, man.  Do you ever see Fearless with Rosie Perez, when her and Jeff Bridges survived the plane crash  together?  Fearless?  It's called Fearless.  They survived a plane crash.  That was a great film, actually.  Yeah, and how it affects them.  Yeah, it's a great flick by Rosie Perez.  Yeah, you should check that out.  It's really good. 
[03:56:30]  Rosie's great.  She has a play out now.  What's it called?  I can't remember right now, but I know she has a play.  She has a play.  You know the comedian...  It's supposed to be interesting and funny, so...  You ever hear the comedian Donkey Sausage, who, like, is famous for the Rosie Perez impression?  No.  She's actually...  All right, well, she does...  She does a great Rosie Perez.  Yeah, she does a great...  Do you have a Rosie Perez impression?  Well, I don't...  No, she's not here, but she's a comedian.  Do you do any impressions?  No, I do my impression pretty good.  I just do you?  All right.  Well, Fat Albert opens... 
[03:57:00]  Christmas Day.  Christmas Day.  Yeah, it's a family movie.  When all the reviewers will be opening up presents, obviously.  What?  I said it's a family movie.  It's funny.  Right.  It's loving.  Go see it.  Check it out.  Well, good luck.  I hope it does well for you.  Thank you so much.  Okay, thank you, Dania.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Good morning.  Bye-bye.  Merry Christmas, all right?  You too.  Bye-bye.  Oh, Dania?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's play...  What did we learn on the Open Anthony program? 
[03:57:30]  What a mess today.  You nailed her.  Chief from New York, I learned that Bernard Getz is actually a better guest than Black Earl.  Cody from Buffalo, I learned, thank God, for AIDS.  Chief also learned...  Wow, Earl, you suck.  Bring Bernie back in.  Sorry about that.  Tommy from Staten Island, today I learned Earl gave O&A a tape for Christmas.  Al Mack from Clifton, today I learned that the craziest people in the city,  come from Brooklyn.  Doug from Arizona, I learned that AIDS was the best solution for street crime. 
[03:58:00]  Who knew?  Al Mack again, today I learned that speed typing is more skillful than shooting.  Yeah, that was one of the many weird things he said, right?  Yeah, shooting, like typing.  I'm going to have to listen to the replay, because he had quite a few wacky theories,  didn't he?  Wacky analogies.  We missed her.  Okay.  Adrian, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, you're welcome.  Hi, Adrian.  Thanks for calling in.  Hey, today I learned that when Bernie was on, well, he did okay.  I mean, he gave it a nice shot. 
[03:58:30]  And that O&A, you know, next week when you guys come back, today, I think you guys went  out with a bang.  Yeah, we went out with a bang today.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Tony in Philly.  Tony, what's up?  What have you done?  What have we done to deserve this, even though we played godfather to your first bastard  children on the air?  You brought Bernie Getz into our bedroom where my wife sleeps, where my children play with  their toys.  I love you, Bernie, from your grandson, Daryl.  Merry Christmas, guys. 
[03:59:00]  You suck.  All right.  You know what?  We really enjoyed Bernie Getz today.  He was great.  I thought it was hysterical.  He's out of his mind.  Let's go to Sean with a J.  What's up, Sean with a J?  Hey, I learned Jim Norton's going to be at the downtown tonight.  Thank you, Sean.  Yes, I'm going down there to see Mr. Norton myself.  Hope you have tickets, LOL.  We'll all be heading down to the downtown tonight to see Jimmy Norton.  Oh, 30?  Very quick.  All right.  Let's go to Rich from Philly.  Yo, guys.  I learned that Doug Flutie needs better DNA for this person. 
[03:59:30]  Oh.  Yeah, that came out of right field.  Oh.  That was very good.  Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hi, Rob.  I learned that Mike Tyson, if he's not punching you in the face or fucking  you in the mouth, he ain't that bad of a guy.  There you go.  I did learn that.  I forgot about that.  Ah, handy information.  All right.  I guess we're out of here.  Merry Christmas to you.  Merry Christmas.  We'll see you on Monday Live.  Bye.  That's it.

[04:01:00]  Now through December 31st, 04.  Void where prohibited.  I do like the permanency of marriage.  I never did like breaking up with people.  And I guess everybody here is broken up with somebody.  And we've all heard the breakup lines.  There's a million of them.  I was picking out a few of my favorites.  Like, I need some space.  Which is half a sentence.  The rest of it is without you in it.  I think my all-time favorite, I think we should start seeing other people.  Trust me, nobody's ever said that one to you without having somebody else in mind. 
[04:01:30]  Guys, if a woman says to you, I think we should start seeing other people.  Trust me, she has already cut a pony from the herd.  And if she ain't riding him yet, she has pulled the saddle out of the barn.  What else is going on?  What about the 70s in the...  What about the 70s?  What about what?  You tell me, what were you doing in the moment? 
[04:02:00]  Since the shit just hit you.  What about the 70s?  Because this damn show ain't Ricky Link.  What about the 70s?  And when people started growing their hair and the...  What do you want to know about the 70s?  The 70s was a cool time, I think.  70s, I mean, I was a young boy, so, you know, going through my trials, my tribulations, but I think they were cool.  I think people were together at that time.  You know, you got together, had your little drink on, you could party like a motherfucker, chill, you know, everybody had their shit. 
[04:02:30]  Now, everybody got an attitude.  Nobody don't really respect nobody.  You know, you get on the dance floor, you scared to bump into a motherfucker.  If your shit too...  You could have your motherfucker dance on, bump in the wrong motherfucker.  Bow, excuse me, slam.  No, nigga, bitch, forgot my Big Mac.  Now, you bump in the...  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.
