<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with self-deprecating humor about their low ratings, immediately followed by a fiery declaration of war against Howard Stern, promising to relentlessly pursue and harass him.  A large portion of the show was dedicated to their "Assault on the Media" contest, specifically highlighting No Filter Paul's successful ambush of a Channel 7 news crew at Radio City Music Hall.  Audio and video of this incident were promised online. No Filter Paul was declared the November winner, and December prizes—gift certificates, electronics, concert tickets, and a dinner with E-Rock—were announced.  The upcoming Eggnog Drinking Contest and the annual "homeless shopping spree" were also heavily promoted.  Several callers, including Troy the Trucker, phoned in, and there was discussion of technical difficulties with show replays and listener-submitted Dickie Goodman parodies.  In-studio guests included No Filter Paul, Francine (who inadvertently offended Bill Burr by mentioning the Dave Chappelle show), Tippi Tom, and Keith the Cop, who detailed the colorful backgrounds of the individuals he was recruiting for the homeless shopping spree.

The show continued with an interview of Tippi, a homeless individual, who described their life on the subway (favoring the L train) and excitedly anticipated the shopping spree, interspersed with Sinatra and Tom Jones song snippets.  The hosts then spoke with Spoon, the "Spoon Man," who recounted being beaten up after stealing money while high. He detailed his homeless lifestyle, earnings, and performed a self-composed song.

The focus shifted to the Eggnog Drinking Contest, featuring reigning champion Pat from Monaki and newcomer Eric "Badlands" Booker, a professional competitive eater whose imposing size intimidated Pat. Badlands even played a song from his rap album.  Several callers boasting their competitive eating prowess engaged in trash talk.  The contest rules were explained: contestants drank double shots of eggnog every minute until vomiting or tapping out.  A brief detour discussed a New Jersey bear hunting problem near one contestant's residence, including a short sound clip of the hunt.

The eggnog drinking contest itself was a chaotic event with fifteen initial participants, leading to logistical challenges with eggnog supply.  The hosts provided running commentary as contestants vomited, sweated, and shook, often simultaneously ("dueling pukes").  Contestants employed various strategies, including pacing and "psych outs." The competition eventually narrowed down to Jams, Pat, and Eric Badlands Booker.  After consuming over 70 double shots, both Pat and Badlands vomited on the 71st shot, resulting in Badlands' victory due to a technicality.  Pat received consolation prizes including adult novelty items.  A caller graphically described the bathroom aftermath.

The show concluded with interviews of actors from *A Christmas Story*, specifically Scott Schwartz, who detailed his child acting experiences, his subsequent career in adult films (naming several porn stars and describing specific encounters), his WWF ring crew work, and collaborations with Andrew Dice Clay. He also mentioned working on a film for Richard Pryor’s MS treatment and promoted his online magazine, *MossCapital*.  A caller, T. Bagger, an adult film performer himself, critiqued Schwartz's work. Schwartz also described working on *L.A. Twister* and his transition into animation and puppeteering.  Listeners called in, one confirming an acquaintance with Schwartz’s father.  The hosts gave away Jägermeister Music Tour tickets.  A humorous anecdote about a post-*Trainspotting* encounter involving his adult film career was shared.  The show ended with a highly intoxicated Tippi Tom appearing on set, engaging in vulgar and bizarre behavior including displaying his buttocks and a brief, incomplete Christmas carol.

The show that's very low in the ratings.  The Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:06:00]  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony program.  Hey, everybody, we're all going to get laid.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Good morning.  The show that's very low in the ratings.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The show that's very low in the ratings.  The Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:06:30]  The radio show that's very low in the ratings.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Poor Billy.  We love when we get under people's skin.  Oh, man.  We absolutely live for it on this program.  And once again, we got under someone's skin.  Wow.  A couple of people this morning.  And we're not talking about crybaby Howie today. 
[00:07:00]  No.  Howie who has lost his edge.  Nah, you know, you put yourself out there.  Hope you're looking forward to seeing Howie crying all over national TV in the near future.  Now that I'm older.  I didn't mean all those bad things I said to everybody.  This is the only radio show that still has a fucking edge. 
[00:07:30]  Crying about a...  We're not going to be crying on national TV anytime soon.  I guess I should have...  I never meant to, you know, wish cancer on the guy.  I was young at the time and I...  How do my hip-hop clothes look?  I was younger.  It was before I had to, you know, get a finger up my ass to check my prostate.  I guess I should have appreciated my employees a little better. 
[00:08:00]  But...  Yeah.  Shut up.  Maybe your guys shouldn't be out fucking...  Doing bar gigs, you ass.  Doing bar gigs.  When you're getting a half a billion dollars and your fucking producer has to go out and  scrape together a few hundred bucks at bar nights.  Eek.  That's a hell of a boss right there.  Have fun with him.  What a great guy.  Have fun over there.  Taking care of all the people that made you big. 
[00:08:30]  That's terrific.  But I'm looking forward to seeing him crying all over national TV.  It's going to be wonderful.  Like my impression.  I don't do many.  It sounded a lot like the guy that types in unhappy.  Oh, yeah.  Crying happy.  I was...  All right.  Yeah, that guy.  Yeah.  And you guys never...  Shut up.  And he does the typing thing.  Shut up.  I just started.  Go.  The new mantra, by the way, wherever Howard Stern goes, our pests will be there. 
[00:09:00]  Just remember that.  Anyway, but we're not talking about Howie right now.  No.  We definitely...  Well, this psychopath, man.  Yeah, we got no filter Paul in studio.  No filter Paul.  And where do we begin?  Well, you know the Assault on the Media contest.  We absolutely love it.  It's great.  There are people that think it's a horrible thing we're doing out there.  The only people that really don't like this are the people in the media. 
[00:09:30]  Everyone else enjoys it.  Everyone else loves when they're surprised and see it on TV.  They're just like watching the news and it pops up.  It makes the news so much more fun and exciting for everybody.  Right.  But the people that are involved, the reporters on the street, the anchor people that they  have to go back to awkwardly, they cannot stand this.  And one thing they really hate about it is they're pretty much powerless to do anything 
[00:10:00]  about it.  As long as the rules are adhered to, you don't ever touch the reporter or anybody else that  works for the company there.  And you just hold up a sign.  You yell things out.  Like, it's fair game, man.  It's public.  It's what they say when you're a kid.  Government property.  That's right.  I'm not on your lawn.  I'm on government property.  You can't kick me off when you stand on the curb just to piss the guy off that lived there.  That's what you do. 
[00:10:30]  So behind the camera, in front of the camera, any of that spot, any of that space, when they  take it out on the streets, those things happen.  Yeah.  Fair game.  And we run the contests every month.  And for the month of December, the prizes have gotten even better.  So we've got full support of XM Satellite Radio.  Full support.  The prizes are getting better.  For December, just to let you know, a $500 gift certificate to Outlawsteakhouse.com, where 
[00:11:00]  they fly in fresh steaks and lobsters.  Nice.  So the winner of the Assault in the Media Contest for December is going to get $500 worth  of steaks and maybe lobsters.  Is that including E-Rock over your house to eat them?  No.  You still get to dinner at Paisano's and Mulder Street in Little Italy with E-Rock.  E-Rock optional.  Or without E-Rock.  Right.  E-Rock is an option.  Also, you get a Nintendo DS handheld gaming system with Mario Kart DS.  Then you get a ton of Jaeger prizes, including guitars, amps, guitar cases, and a VIP pass 
[00:11:30]  to see Disturbed and Corrosion of Conformity when they come to your town.  Plus, you get a MiFi radio and a free subscription for your new MiFi.  What did the first guy get?  Plus, admission to the Opie and Anthony show to see one of our fine programs live.  The first winner of the Assault on the Media get.  Didn't he get one of those little red XM cushions?  Yeah.  Seat cushions.  We did tell you the prizes would get better to hang in there. 
[00:12:00]  And they're getting better and better as we go along here.  So anyway, we weren't going to start this show with the whole Assault on the Media thing,  but we're set up for the Eggnog Drinking Contest.  And no filter, Paul's here.  Are you in the contest today?  No, I came in because I was planning on going out with Sonny to try and do an Assault,  but you guys found one for me before I even got here.  Sonny drove down from Boston again?  Yeah, he brought his friend to the contest.  His friend is in the contest.  Oh, okay.  So Sonny Farrelly, who's known for doing a lot of Assaults on the Media in the Boston area, 
[00:12:30]  was coming down with his friend.  The friend's going to be in the Eggnog Drinking Contest.  No filter, Paul came by to say hi to Sonny,  and then they were going to hit the streets and maybe find an Assault on the Media.  Well, we were in the office, and good old Billy Boy from Channel 7 again.  Holy shit.  I just realized that.  That's what I said.  I just realized the connection.  Channel 7.  Yeah.  I was doing something outside Radio City Music Hall with the Rockettes and a goofy Santa.  They sent old Billy Boy over there to do the weather guy to do a little thing with the Rockettes. 
[00:13:00]  Had some Rockettes, and, you know, he talks to the Rockettes.  There was a big goofy Santa out there.  And then he tells you the weather after he gets you in the Christmas spirit.  And, oh, my God.  It was horrific to watch.  It was so uncomfortable.  It was horrific to watch.  He goes to his shot, and he's talking to one of the Rockettes,  and I think he was right in the middle of asking what her name was and where she was from.  Yeah.  And you just barely see a piece of the sign. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, because the cameramen now are so hip to this, they know, just get off the shot.  Get off of it.  Not only that, it looks like no filter, Paul hit a brick wall.  Like, he couldn't run any more forward.  Yeah.  That was one of their security people.  You hit a brick wall because he was flying into the shot.  You see part of the sign, like you're going to see the rest of the sign.  Stop dead.  Stop dead in his track.  And then the camera goes swinging off, but not fast enough.  I've got to get a still picture of this once we get the video up online. 
[00:14:00]  Billy's face.  The surprise and fear in his face is a great still.  And wait until you see the video.  He looks like he was ready to jump out of the way of a car.  Yeah, that's the look.  You know when you walk across the street and you think it's clear and there's a car there  and you go, you make the face.  That was the face he made.  It was perfect.  And he's trying to go through and be professional about it.  The cameraman is now zooming on something on a building.  He actually stopped on a wreath on a building, a Christmas wreath. 
[00:14:30]  He found something to go to as Billy is doing his weather thing.  But you just hear the lunatic that is no filter pulse screaming in the background.  Couldn't do it.  They cut everything, went right back to the studio to a completely disgusted Steve at the desk.  Good old Steve.  Good old Steve.  Good old crystal meth Steve.  And first he has to say that he isn't even going to dignify it. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  And then he goes on to dignify it.  Yeah, we got the audio to play for everybody.  And then for the rest of the newscast, it was only another 20 minutes left.  They were the whole crew.  You were so pissed off.  You could tell.  I expect them here at the studios today.  I expect them to show up at the studio.  Yeah, I predict to confront us.  I predict trouble from this one in some way, shape, or form.  If it isn't them coming down to the studio here, I predict some trouble from this one  that will probably make the papers. 
[00:15:30]  Because this fucked them up so bad.  And it was so visible.  Sonny actually came down right after we hit him that time.  And he was sitting down there ready to hit him again while we were standing at the end of the block.  There four security people were just looking at us with their arms crossed.  And Sonny was on the other side.  And then the news guy, the weather guy, he put his head back right against the wall.  And that was going to be the next shot.  From what I can hear, they never went back.  Their final shot, they went back.  It was very quick.  He went right to a weather map.  And they set the shot up so there was no way anyone could get behind him. 
[00:16:00]  They were right against Radio City Music Hall's doors.  Security was on both sides.  And the shot was so tight, they couldn't do anything.  And Billy, livid.  He's trying to be all happy.  He's there with Santa and the Rockettes, the holiday spirit.  And he's got a scowl on his face.  And even the traffic copter guy was pissed.  The fat guy that they go to for traffic, he was pissed.  Like, everyone just pissed off.  Oh, there's phone calls being made right now. 
[00:16:30]  And this is just the way everyone feels when they get around No Filter Paul.  Right.  You just get all angry and pissed off.  It's just like sitting with him alone in Starbucks with a country watch.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You cunt sent me down now.  It's great, though.  I have to see that.  You guys have the whole 20 minutes of video of all these guys who look all pissed off and everything?  20 minutes of video.  Yeah, you can see the follow-up and everything.  You're not worth the time.  Well, I know that.  Trust me.  I was pissed off for five seconds and I went back to reading. 
[00:17:00]  Great stuff.  It was great stuff.  And Channel 7 again.  I don't know why.  It's just working out that way.  Yeah.  Channel 7 has gotten hit so many times it's not even funny.  So here's the audio.  The video will be up on opianthony.com in the very near future.  What's great about this one is when they finally go back to the anchor desk and good old Steve.  Yeah.  Good old Steve wants to yell and scream.  He's trying to still act like an anchorman.  And then he has to say something.  And that's why we started the show with low ratings. 
[00:17:30]  He wanted to blow it off.  And then the chick that he sits with said something.  She did?  Yeah.  She just kind of did like a...  Yeah.  Like she was disgusted.  So now...  I think he was hoping she would have ran with the ball and just kind of got them back on track.  And since she was disgusted, he then had to come back and explain why he was disgusted even though he did not want to explain it.  All right.  Here we go.  You're looking at the beautiful Rockettes, the stars of the show.  The Christmas Spectacular. 
[00:18:00]  A show gets underway today at 10 o'clock tomorrow, 9 o'clock in the morning.  There's tickets available and there's plenty of shows to see.  This is Rhonda.  Where are you from?  I'm from Los Angeles.  Oh, so you must really be enjoying this cold weather that we have here in New York.  You know, at some point, well, I'm not even going to get a dignified.  It's a radio team that is very low in the ratings and that's what they need.  All right.  He's got the 70s over the clock.  A radio team that's very low in the ratings. 
[00:18:30]  Very low in the ratings.  I don't even know what ratings are anymore, you ass.  Thank God we don't deal.  There's no ratings with satellite radio.  We don't deal with ratings.  Thank God anymore.  Well, she just said well and that...  Well, and that set him off.  He was so hoping that there would just be something she would do to get him out of that.  Yeah.  And when she just went, well, fan-fucking-tastic.  He did become Danny Dignify It relatively quickly, didn't he?  Yeah.  Let's say nothing. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, I'm not even going to dignify that.  A radio team that's very low in the ratings.  I have to thank Joe and Rich, the two guys who went with me.  I just picked them off the line, the eggnog line outside.  Oh, they were yelling too?  Yeah.  I thought it sounded like more than just you yelling.  Yeah, there was actually four security people and every one of us just got pushed by the  body.  They didn't touch us without hands.  They just used their bodies to push us out of the shot.  Yeah.  And then some dude's like, oh, you're immature.  And I told him to go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's going to make us stop by saying we're immature.  Immature. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  That just makes them work harder, you idiots.  And then they stood and watched us while Sonny walked straight past us pretending he didn't  know us and walked right behind them.  Yeah.  But it's a shame they...  They just don't know what the hell to do.  But why Channel 7 again?  You guys did that on purpose, I swear to God.  No.  No.  It's just...  That's the way it turns out.  Hey, all of them are fair game, man.  They're all fair game.  Actually, I think that Channel 7 has the most live teams.  I think that's one of their things.  Is that it?  It's a compliment almost.  So I think it's much easier to find one of those assholes.  Why would you do a live shot four blocks from this station? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, there's going to be nothing.  There could be a frigging massacre outside of this building and they will do it from the  studio.  There will be no live shot.  We'd love to take you there live, but...  There's going to be a massacre in January.  What the hell does that mean?  Yeah, what does that mean?  Sturn you.  Oh, come on.  I'm trying to help you out here.  Wow.  Yeah.  We were supposed to figure that out?  You get...  You get another one for even trying to explain that.  Well, the army is building. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, it certainly is.  It is fantastic.  Yeah.  Well, you did a bang-up job.  That was great.  You are very...  Any chance to just get that Billy boy annoyed?  Well, you're very welcome and we are going to go back outside and continue to watch Channel  7 now and see where they're going.  All right.  Now they're national with Good Morning America.  Is that Times Square or Union Square?  Times Square.  We haven't messed with Good Morning America in a while.  No.  Maybe...  Yeah, but that might be a good idea.  I am told that they have a ton of security there and the Today Show, they have like a  security force. 
[00:21:00]  I don't know if it's just for you guys.  Really?  Probably.  Today Show probably is.  Between the tits we put on that and the assault on the media going on, yeah.  Well, the Today Show went into a delay thing because of our tit thing that we did about  five years ago.  All right.  We'll play the audio again here.  Yeah.  The video is great as well, but the disgust on good old Steve's face after this is just  priceless.  You're looking at the beautiful Rockettes, the stars of the show.  The Christmas Spectacular.  Our show gets underway today at 10 o'clock tomorrow, 9 o'clock in the morning.  There's tickets available and there's plenty of shows to see. 
[00:21:30]  This is Rhonda.  Where are you from?  I'm from Los Angeles.  Oh, so you must really be enjoying this cold weather that we have here in New York.  Oh, we are really enjoying...  You know, it's sometimes...  Well, I'm not even going to get a dignifier.  Well...  It's a radio team that is very low in the ratings and that's what they need.  What are you going to do?  All right.  He's got the 7.  And she goes, there you go.  Did you hear, Billy?  They obviously had to say something.  She goes, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Dude, did you hear Billy's uncomfortable laugh?  Yeah.  Like, you're yelling. 
[00:22:00]  He's trying to get through it and then he goes...  There's a little thing right before they cut away.  Play that again.  Where he's trying his darndest to get through it.  And then he just goes...  You're looking at the beautiful Rockettes, the stars of the show.  The Christmas Spectacular.  A show gets underway today at 10 o'clock tomorrow, 9 o'clock in the morning.  There's tickets available and there's plenty of shows to see.  This is Rhonda.  Where are you from?  I'm from Los Angeles.  Oh, so you must really be enjoying this cold weather that we have here in New York.  We are really enjoying... 
[00:22:30]  I don't want to punch this limey fuck.  And then finally.  You know, at some point...  I'm going to get a dignified.  It's a radio team that is very low in the ratings and that's what they need.  There you go.  Oh, I love it.  You told them.  Yeah.  Dressed us down, didn't he?  Hey, Steve, you ass.  We don't have ratings on satellite radio.  You feel bad for those four ladies that stood out there to be on TV? 
[00:23:00]  Hi, Mom.  I'm going to be on TV.  And we just fuck up this show.  Yeah.  I did spoil the whole thing.  Ruined it.  Stupid release pedophile in a Santa outfit.  Fuck all of them.  That's not news.  Yeah, and there's a guy, Steve, who sits behind that desk and comes back from a story about a kid toucher, murderers, rapists, and not an inkling of emotion or anything, just back onto the next story.  All right, we just heard about that murder, but hey, we got Billy Boy, and he's water skiing today down in the lake. 
[00:23:30]  Let's check in with him.  And the disgust he showed for you, Paul, and the assault on the media and our show was just, it should have been reserved for the guy that shot that cop and the guy that killed that 11-year-old girl.  But no.  No.  It's interfering with them directly.  Now they're mad.  Now it's interrupting.  Now it's time to speak up.  Now it's time to break character and say something on the news. 
[00:24:00]  I love it.  I fucking love this promotion.  Hey, we were going to do a whole big thing.  We forgot to do it yesterday.  The assault on the media contest for November is obviously over.  Yep.  Instead of doing the whole big thing, we just want to congratulate No Filter Paul.  He won the contest.  Bravo, Paul.  You are absolutely the winner.  And officially in the lead for December.  December. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, there's no rule here as far as how many times you can win in a row.  Sunny.  Give me the finger right now.  You actually have just picked up your victory trophy to take back to England with you.  I guess England is now representing the winner.  No, it's Jersey officially.  Oh, Jersey.  Can you tell me which assault it was that won?  Because I have to divide the prizes with whoever it was.  I did this.  Well, how many did you do for November?  It was four or five.  Yeah, he did four or five.  I think it's the one where the woman leaves the frigging, just leaves the scene. 
[00:25:00]  I believe it's this one.  Let's take a listen.  She slowly stepped off the box she was on and left the camera to you idiots.  Officially, this is the winner of the assault on the media contest for November.  Here's the audio with no filter, Paul.  Now, once again, the musicians say there.  Oh, get out of the XMCA radio!  Oh, get out of the XMCA!  Oh, get out of the XMCA!  With the trumpet.  There's a trumpet.  Stacy got out of the way.  So, that was Stacy Sager reporting live from Midtown.  And she was smooth back at the desk.  Yeah.  Oh, there was a problem out there.  She didn't throw a piece of paper and go, 
[00:25:30]  I'm not even going to dignify that by doing what I'm going to do and now dignify it.  A radio team that's low in the ratings.  Low in the ratings, so they're doing what they've got to do.  And desperate.  Oh, is that fantastic?  At least we're not low in the T-cell count.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I hate some drugs and throw away those condoms, faggot.  Shut up. 
[00:26:00]  Fantastic.  So, there you go.  And what a professional you are.  Like I said, he's claiming the victory trophy, which is now back in Jersey.  Uh-huh.  And it went from where?  Boston?  Boston.  Sonny Ferelli.  Went from Boston.  It's going to now make the long trek down 95 and reside in Jersey for another month.  And, at the same time, he is in the lead with that last one.  Yes.  Fantastic job, Paul.  Uh, who, uh, what was the, uh, what was the runners-up?  Who was the runners-up?  What was the order?  Uh, Big A actually came in third. 
[00:26:30]  Okay.  But I think they were just being nice to him, quite frankly.  Because we had a lot of great assaults on the media in November.  And Mike and Drake it, who did one last minute, pretty much.  Right, I saw that one.  That was pretty good.  That was pretty good.  They moved the camera with that, just like they did today.  The guy just moved the camera completely.  Yeah.  Mike and Drake it, and then, uh, Paul and, uh, who else did it?  It was Mike, the assault on the media guy, and, uh, Bam was the guy on the trumpet.  So we're going to divide the prizes up.  All right.  And, Bam, you get third choice.  Third?  Yeah.  Third.  Third.  Third.  Big, Big A is such a buffoon.  Uh, I, I saw him, uh, the other night on, um, Pal Talk. 
[00:27:00]  And he's sitting, he's sitting at this big, like, button-tuck leather chair and a desk  with a window behind him.  I swear it was the set of The Godfather.  All he needed was to be stroking a cat and having people and asking him for favors.  I'm Enzo the Baker.  He actually lives in The Godfather house, sitting there with his big, dopey head.  He needs, like, widescreen, high-definition, uh, uh, computer cam to fit that huge head 
[00:27:30]  of his.  All right.  So, Paul.  Thank you.  Look how they massacred me.  Look, look at Sonny outside.  He's still convinced that I called the Fox channel on him.  Look.  Once someday, you may have to return to the favor.  Look how I massacred my speech.  Big A will be doing some more assaults.  We actually, I actually overranged that whole last one and did the spotting for him.  We're going to do something really crazy with him next. 
[00:28:00]  Um, yeah.  Oh, we got your assault on, uh, the media up already.  It's already up on Foundry.  And these guys are fast.  Foundry Music.com and OpieAndAnthony.com.  Remember when it used to take, uh, hours?  It used to take a day.  Now, bam.  They're on there.  Now it's, uh, all right.  Anthony, really fast, because, uh, the contest is on for December.  Just so, um, some people out there have, uh, initiative.  Here are all the prizes for December.  The Assault on the Media Contest for December.  $500 gift certificate to OutlawSteakhouse.com.  Bravo.  You go on there and you pick out steaks, $500 worth, or lobsters, whatever else they sell. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  And they'll send it right out.  I guess they sent us a package and the boys enjoyed the steaks.  It was unbelievable.  Nice.  Also, you get a Nintendo DS handheld gaming system with Mario Kart DS, Jaeger prizes out  the ass, Jaegermeister, guitars, amps, guitar cases, VIP passes to see disturbed and corrosion  of conformity when they hit your town.  Then you get a Delphi MiFi radio with free subscription for your new MiFi for a year.  You get dinner with E-Rock at Paisano's and Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. 
[00:29:00]  E-Rock optional.  And admission to the Opie and Anthony Show studios to watch the show live through a glass  partition in a beekeeper outfit.  All right.  And, you know, just remember the one simple rule.  Just don't touch them.  That's it.  Don't touch them.  They can't do anything to you.  We know that.  Don't touch them.  We figured out this lovely loophole and it's driving them nuts.  Nothing they can do about it.  Driving them nuts.  Have fun.  All right.  Let's say hi to Troy the trucker.  Troy.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's up, Troy? 
[00:29:30]  Hey, these guys, I've been listening to you guys for about a month now.  These guys that call in and fish to you and say you spend too much time on this,  this is the funniest shit I've ever heard.  You guys crack me up.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you, mister.  Hey, also, one other thing.  You've got to get your replays fixed in the afternoon.  That's mainly when I listen, but they've been messing up the last couple of days.  There's been a couple of issues going on.  But other than that, boys, you guys do a hell of a job.  Keep it up.  I'm out.  All right.  Thanks, Drew.  The replays.  We understand. 
[00:30:00]  Believe me, it's not just going with some guy looking over going,  is there a problem?  They're pawing over it.  And it seemed to be fixed.  They think they know what it is, actually.  They think one of Elo's Shempwigs fell into the machinery.  It's a delight problem.  The master computer has been fucking up really badly this week.  Master computer.  Very, very scary.  Let's put it on a tape.  What happened to tape? 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  Tape was so reliable.  Unless it broke.  It's too bad, too, because yesterday's show was really, really stellar.  Yeah.  A lot of fun.  And three replays of the Dickie Goodman segment.  Wow.  People were just like, you know, why couldn't it be the guy with the book?  You know, the Ramon phone calls, shit like that.  But no, it was three times we had to hear all the Dickie Goodman songs again,  over and over. 
[00:31:00]  That's how the replay screwed up.  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  All right.  I actually got on the phone with Elo yesterday about it.  And I never call Elo.  He was like, already, the second he saw it was me, he had General Motors on the other  line.  He was trying to get a door.  He assumed.  He was trying to figure out what part he needed to get.  Only reason.  Yeah.  He told the guy, just stand by.  I'm going to have a part number for you in a second.  Speaking of Dickie Goodman, we got six of them that came in overnight. 
[00:31:30]  Six of them.  Six Dickie Goodman.  Now, people, don't panic.  Don't panic.  I know they're probably going, I'm not sitting through six Dickie Goodman parodies done by  your listeners.  No, we actually came in early today and decided to pre-listen to stuff.  Yeah, we listened to them.  To save you the trouble.  The agony.  To save you the trouble and the agony.  And we found one that's worth playing.  One out of the six that came in.  And it's from Boobie Man from Brooklyn.  The six were so incredibly bad, they weren't even good enough bad to play. 
[00:32:00]  Not like bad where it's like laughable.  Just bad.  Boring bad.  Stupid bad.  Yeah.  And then the last one on the list was playable.  Only because it's what it is.  It's terrific.  Listen to this.  We're here with Mr. Dickie Goodman.  What are you doing, Mr. Goodman?  Thank God.  And that's it.  Terrific.  That was the only one worth playing today.  And I think it's a statement, too. 
[00:32:30]  I think like Dickie, the bit itself has a gaping head wound.  We'll see what Monday brings.  Yeah.  All right.  We should take our first break, huh?  We've got to get to know our contestants.  Today it's the Eggnog Drinking Contest.  I was up all night.  Just couldn't wait.  I'm not even kidding you.  It was like Christmas Eve.  I was so eager to come in here today.  I've been looking forward to this ever since the last one.  Yeah.  Which was a year ago, obviously.  What a year?  This is our first annual thing? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Like our recurring bit?  Yeah.  This is our recurring bit.  This is a benchmark, Opie.  This is what we do to welcome in the Christmas season.  Isn't that great?  That's what we do now.  We have a thing.  And coming soon, the homeless shopping spree.  And you know what's going to happen?  We get fired.  We break our word and don't stop doing this.  We get another gig.  And people start bitching.  Why don't you guys do what you used to do?  Like the Eggnog Challenge.  See, we're making those bits that people bitch we don't do later. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  Isn't that great?  We're building.  One year.  What?  Paul's talking to E-Rock as the show's going on.  Look at disgusted E-Rock.  He's diligently working at the computer and Paul's just interrupting him.  Now, he was showing me the video.  That's what it was.  But I noticed an instant feedback saying that it should be a prize of speech therapy.  Speech therapy.  I know, exactly.  Speaks for itself.  That was the funny part.  You know, you're a perfect example of skinny fat, by the way.  Listen, leave De Niro in the last half of Raging Bullbody alone. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, but the rest of his body is like, you know, skinny arms, skinny lash.  He's skinny fat, it's called.  Dude, that belly legs, skinny ass, and a big pot belly.  Yeah, well, you should make the next prize for next time with a treadmill, maybe.  Come on, laugh.  No carcass laugh.  Mom.  I know, really.  We love having you on.  Yeah, really.  Because it really annoys everybody out there.  All right, no filter, Paul.  All right, thank you, boys. 
[00:34:30]  Good stuff for the radio show.  Have a good time, and I enjoy the contest.  And what, are you going to be prowling the streets?  I'm not sure yet.  I don't know if you guys out there have time to look.  Probably just watch the contest.  I would take the rest of the morning off.  Yeah, you did a good job.  You had a really good one today.  As a matter of fact, as we go to break, we should play that again.  Yeah, I got to hear the disgusted Steve.  And by the way.  Frightened Billy Boy.  For the dopes that don't like anything that we do on this program, before they start commenting  and writing about this, because I was keeping track, my Rain Man mentality and my OCD, we 
[00:35:00]  spent exactly 32 minutes and 45 seconds this week talking about the assault on the media.  Mm-hmm.  This week?  This week.  Wow.  Because I am sick of hearing the post.  They're spending too much time on it.  They're spending too much.  They're spending too much time on the assault on the media.  Can't they come up with anything new?  Dink these guys.  I love the typing mad guy. 
[00:35:30]  Well, these assholes have challenged me, so now I'm like, all right, I'm going to keep  track of stuff.  Because typing mad guy's fingers don't move at all.  They just go up and down.  Up and down.  Up and down.  They don't.  They do the same two keys.  It's XM, XM, XM, XM.  C, N, Z, K, Z, K, Z, K, Z.  If you think about a week of radio, and a radio show that doesn't play a lot of commercials,  32 some odd minutes is not a lot of time.  Sorry.  It just isn't.  Now you just increased it, though.  What did I say? 
[00:36:00]  You're just talking about it now.  You added another minute.  But I said about or whatever.  The longer we go, the more minutes it will be gone.  Oh, I've got to add, like, 15 more seconds.  You're right.  Shit.  I like how he actually writes.  He's writing down the number 15 on a piece of paper.  Wait, you think I'm kidding?  You don't think I...  No, I've seen you write everything down.  You don't think I have...  I just picture your house like a beautiful mind where there's papers stuck all over the wall.  All with just inane babble and these writings that you have. 
[00:36:30]  Of course.  Makes sense to you.  You don't think I would actually come in here and make shit up.  No.  I kept track this week.  Mm-hmm.  Because these guys challenged me.  You imagine Imus comes over your house every night and talks to you about missions and...  Because that's the stupidest argument when they say they spend too much time on a certain thing.  Yeah.  Because if you really take a step back and think about what a radio show is all about  and how much time we have to fill, you'd be surprised how much little time we do spend on the assault on the media.  Certainly would. 
[00:37:00]  And other things.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  No problem, guys.  Thanks, Paul.  You're welcome.  We said that 10 minutes ago.  That means take headphones off.  Take a walk.  Jason, the trucker.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I've been on for about two months now, I guess.  I just want to say, the more you guys rag on how we're starting, the more I love this fucking show, man.  Yeah, he's pretty much a pussy.  Yeah, he's a genetic wonder, man.  He's the first dick I've ever seen that walked and talked. 
[00:37:30]  He just has to take our shit.  There's nothing he can do about that.  He needed a talking thing.  And now he's going to go on a huge campaign where he's going to be sensitive Howie,  and you're going to practically see tears in his eyes and sensitive stern.  And he's going to be regretting things he's done in the past because now he's an older guy.  Although he's still trying to dress like he's a wigger.  He's 52 years old in hip-hop clothes.  Yeah, well, I don't know how long he's been on radio.  I mean, hell, he's been on there a while. 
[00:38:00]  But I'm going to say they wasted their fucking time with him the whole time they had him on.  All right.  Thank you, Jason.  All right, buddy.  Thank you, Mike.  Bye.  Love them truckers.  All right, we're going to break with No Filter Paul.  This happened about a half hour ago, 40 minutes ago.  Okay.  30 seconds plus five, seven-second intro.  Maybe seven more seconds.  All right.  You're looking at the beautiful Rockettes, the stars of the show, of the Christmas Spectacular.  A show gets underway today at 10 o'clock tomorrow, 9 o'clock in the morning. 
[00:38:30]  There's tickets available, and there's plenty of shows to see.  This is Rhonda.  Where are you from?  I'm from Los Angeles.  Oh, so you must really be enjoying this cold weather that we have here in New York.  Oh, we are really enjoying it.  You know, at some point, well, I'm not even going to get a dignifier.  Well, it's a radio team that is very low in the ratings, and that's what they need.  What are you going to do?  All right.  He's got for seven.  He's over the cross.  We've got Francine in the studio. 
[00:39:00]  You ready for the news, Francine?  Yeah.  Hi, Francine.  Hello, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  You don't like Anthony better than me.  What about Bill?  I said hi to Bill.  Hey, how are you?  I love your show.  This Chappelle's great.  Oh, oh, a way to bring it up.  What do you mean?  If Chappelle didn't, like, decide to go away for a while, Bill would still be doing that  show.  Yeah, I'm going to be hanging out doing this shit.  It's a soft subject with him.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[00:39:30]  I really liked it, though.  I just want to say I liked it.  It's a war.  It's a war.  Yeah, I mean, it was just like a great moment of my life, and now it's over, and I was just  starting to not, like, think about it every day.  Didn't Ben tell you?  Good job.  No, he didn't tell me.  Everyone has been told around here not to mention that.  You ever heard us bring it up?  No, I haven't.  We haven't even asked Bill the question everyone asks Bill.  What's Chappelle up to?  We don't even ask, because we know it bothers him.  And you had to just casually say that to him. 
[00:40:00]  I'm sorry.  It's fucked up.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  I didn't know.  I didn't know it for me.  I still liked it, though.  It was great.  Oh, bring it up again.  Bring it up again.  Wow.  This is not a bit.  He doesn't want to hear that.  Okay.  Eek.  All right.  Apologize to him.  I'm sorry, Bill.  A little late.  A little fucking late.  Well, this is a little uncomfortable.  I'm sorry, Bill.  I told you to not fucking bring it up.  They're testing you.  Oh.  Don't ever bring it up again. 
[00:40:30]  Okay.  Don't even make eye contact with me for the rest of this week, okay?  Fucking answer the floor.  What aren't you supposed to bring up as far as Bill Burgo from now on so we know for next  time?  Because some people are saying you're dumb.  I want them to know you're not dumb.  That you know and won't be bringing this up anymore.  Right.  I believe it's the pulpit.  Jesus fucking Christ.  How many fucking times?  I was just getting past this fucking shit. 
[00:41:00]  Don't bring it up.  Un-fucking-believable.  Don't.  Okay.  Now, you know, finally, you do know that this is off limits.  Okay.  But we're going to never again be brought up, ever.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't we get this out of the way?  Repeat after me, Francine.  Yep.  I, Francine.  I, Francine.  Will never.  Will never. 
[00:41:30]  While Bill Burr is in studio.  While Bill Burr is in studio.  Bring up the Dave Chappelle show.  Bring up the Chappelle show.  Oh, my God.  Get her out of here.  Open it, Anthony.  XMJPN.  Oh, my God.  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness. 
[00:42:00]  Open up your hate.  And then open a mace.  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness.  You mother.  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness.  Fuck.  I get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness.  And then open a mace.  And then open a mace.  Opie's in the shitter, I gather.  Hi.  Welcome back to the Opie and Jimmy, Anthony and Jimmy show.  Opie's in the can.  Yeah, Opie's in the toilet.  In the turlet.  He must be logging one, huh?  Yeah.  He's probably got like this fucking fat, dehydrated log that won't come out. 
[00:42:30]  The one that you just got to push and push and push.  And then you can't.  That's why I rarely take a dump here at the station.  Because you never know if it's going to be one of those where it's like, I'm committed  for a half hour.  You take some of those where you're completely committed for a half hour.  There's no stopping it.  Right.  No nipping it in the bud.  You just got to sit there and take the pain.  It breaks off piece by piece.  You got to keep scooping paper in.  And we were both panicking, by the way, when you weren't in that chair.  Yeah, what are you doing?  You're gone for one minute and we're talking about shit and stalling. 
[00:43:00]  We're instantly going into the shit conversation.  There was a line at the Starbucks machine, man.  You were at the Starbucks machine and there's a line?  There's a line.  You're allowed to cut.  Especially when you hear the intro music come back on.  I'm like, why is Tippi Tom at the Starbucks machine?  And then I realized there was another machine over there for Tippi Tom and his fine friend  that he brought with him.  Tippi Tom is here with Keith the Cop.  The methadone machine in our studio. 
[00:43:30]  I think we're only a couple of weeks away from the homeless shopping spree.  Yes.  Have we nailed down a date on this yet?  Another benchmark.  Have we nailed down a date, Keith?  You're kind of in charge of the homeless shopping spree with Ben.  Yeah, I believe we're doing December 20th.  December 20th?  That's it.  What day is that?  Tuesday.  A Tuesday?  Yeah.  Tuesday.  Isn't that nice?  A Tuesday?  All right, that's cool.  And it's nice and close to the holidays.  Yeah, you don't want to wear those headphones.  People have to pick up the headphones.  No, we learn here on the O.P. Anthony program and we have now homeless headphones. 
[00:44:00]  There's a big jar of formaldehyde and they reside in that up by the wiffle ball bat.  Yeah.  And then you take them out, you kind of just shake them a little and give them to the homeless guy.  Oh, we're a very clean show.  Mm-hmm.  We figured that much out.  But you need, they need to be sprinkled with, what is that stuff called, knit?  I don't know.  That stuff that gets rid.  Rid.  Rid.  Sprinkled with rid.  I've taken that a couple of times.  You got like a little teeny comb with the teeth.  They're so close together to go through your pubes with to get the little lice eggs out. 
[00:44:30]  Because they've got to be close together so they can get all the little crabs and lice and things.  For the eggs, yeah.  The eggs?  Is that what it is?  You're talking Greek to me, Jimmy.  I've never had it.  When you have crabs, you've got to use red.  Hey, we've got to get Ben in here, too.  We're going to get Tibby Tom in here, but there are so many guys out there.  Are they all drinking eggnog today?  This is huge.  You think Ben and Paul are trading bodies?  Talking fashion.  I know they're trading tight sweaters. 
[00:45:00]  Which tight sweater to wear?  They both have tight sweaters on.  Yeah, that sweater's no good.  It actually comes down to your belt.  Yeah, there's a lot of people out there I see wearing meme tags.  There's some big fuckers out there, too, man.  Hey, girls.  Even Pat's looking around like, holy shit, I got my work cut out for me today.  There's no girls.  No friggin' girls.  All right, Keith, who did you bring by today?  Well, today I just, purely coincidental, because I've been telling Tibby Tom all week,  14th Street, 8th Avenue, 7 a.m. 
[00:45:30]  So I get off, shows up at 7th and 14th at 8th.  He shows up at, can't get it together.  So purely coincidental, I'm in Penn Station, and I'm going up to Port Authority,  because now I've learned of the shakedown, the homeless haven of the Port Authority bus terminal.  Oh, yeah.  Which is unbelievable.  And a buddy of mine from Port Authority has been giving me a hand, picking up some of these people.  But I walk in at Penn Station.  I says, let me look upstairs.  And as I'm going up the stairs, I hear Tibby Tom screaming and yelling. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, no.  And there's three cops surrounding him.  They're trying to, like, you know, give him the boot.  And I walk up, and I says, no, no, I'll take him, I'll take him.  They look at me, because I'm in plain clothes.  And I show him my ID.  And the one guy looks at Tibby Tom and goes, you're not going to make the Short Hills Mall if you don't get your ass up and get into it.  That's great.  So it was purely coincidental I picked him up.  And then we have another guy from Port Authority bus terminal.  I think his name is Lindell.  That's where he lives? 
[00:46:30]  He lives at Port Authority.  And he's really going to be the ambassador, because a lot of them are real shaky up at Port Authority about what's going on and believing that, you know, this is what's doing.  Where do they live up there?  They're suspicious as to the motives of this.  They think maybe we'll put him on a bus and drive him down to Louisiana and drop him off.  But I spent some time in there last night interviewing a bunch of them, and I got to get him.  But this morning, oh, yeah, one guy, he's from Arizona, and he got anally raped in a shower. 
[00:47:00]  And any time you mention the word shower, he loses his fucking mind.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, so he freaks out.  So he's a real good guy.  Wow.  I've got a six-foot-two black transvestite who sucks cock in the bathroom and then washes his balls in the sink.  Washes his balls?  Well, actually, the guys blow him, and then he washes his balls in the sink.  So my buddy Jack always has to boot him out of the bathroom.  Holy shit.  But there are some real characters there. 
[00:47:30]  And we got a guy who's got, like, elephant face.  Elephant.  Yeah, he showed up.  Can't you go down there with a recorder?  This would be great.  Audio for the program.  Yeah, I'll grab a dad or something like that.  I'll work on that.  Because I want to hear a shower guy.  God damn, that's funny.  I want to hear a shower guy.  What's elephant guy all about?  He's just, like, half his face has, like, that droop to it.  Yeah.  He's going to be in next week.  Either Tuesday or Thursday next week.  Can't wait.  Yeah, we're going to have a fine crew this year.  Yeah, it's a shopping spree.  It's a good crew. 
[00:48:00]  I heard they're cracking down at Penn Station.  I heard that on winds.  Aggressive panhandlers will not be tolerated.  Yeah.  I think the headline of one of the papers, the Daily News, it's got Commissioner Kelly,  Warren's aggressive panhandlers in Penn Station, your dot, dot, dot, and then huge print.  And here it is, begging for trouble.  Yeah, so if you're an aggressive panhandler, I guess, what, you've got to just sit there 
[00:48:30]  with a cup the second you start approaching people and go, excuse me, excuse me, can I  have some cash?  Well, that place is pretty clean.  Yeah.  I mean, at this point, I was amazed to find him.  Yeah, they've cleaned that out.  But now, apparently, they're at the Port Authority bus terminal.  You know, just to back up a little bit, because, you know, we're talking about the assault  of the media thing and how they think they're, you know, they're really doing their jobs on  the news and stuff.  Well, there was a homeless story recently.  There was a guy that was sleeping in one of the subways, like down the tracks a little 
[00:49:00]  bit, just off the tracks on one of those catwalks, I guess.  So a homeless guy is sleeping, and I guess he rolls over onto the tracks.  Oh, boy.  And he gets run over and killed.  Very tragic story.  Sounds tragic.  The news reports it as, what a drag, you know, the commuters had a very long delay today.  Oh, that was the angle they took?  That was the angle.  I was like, oh.  There were massive delays today, and we're really sorry for that, but this is what happened.  Poor people trying to go to work, and they got to deal with this dead guy. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  They don't even really acknowledge that someone lost their life.  The homeless are definitely just not even human in this city.  They're not treated as humans.  No.  There's a whole different set of rules and laws for them, and it's sad.  Yesterday?  That's why we bring joy to their lives with the homeless shopping spree.  Yesterday, I did not see it, but I saw the aftermath.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:50:00]  Lindsay went to Starbucks, whatever, and she watched a homeless guy at the end of my block  Yeah.  lay down newspaper next to a mailbox and take a dump.  She watched the whole thing happen.  Hey, at least he put down the newspaper.  Took a dump.  But then doesn't pick up the whole mess and throw it away.  No?  No.  He should be fined.  Why do you lay the newspaper down then?  Just drops his pants and just unloads right there on the sidewalk.  That's actually how I met Tippi Tom the first time.  He was squatting between two cars taking a shit. 
[00:50:30]  And when you just walk out, we go, what are you doing?  I actually locked him up that day.  You did?  Yeah.  But, uh...  Didn't he do it out in front of an outdoor cafe in front of a bunch of people eating?  No, that was Ziggy.  Oh, Ziggy.  It was a hot summer day and there must have been about 30 or 40 people outside eating.  And I watched him shuffle down the street.  He just dropped his drawers, sat on the garbage can and shit right in the garbage can.  Pulled his pants back up and just shuffled down the block.  Did he wipe?  No, he don't wipe. 
[00:51:00]  Could you imagine you're sitting there eating at an outdoor cafe, enjoying the scenery,  a nice summer day in New York, and a homeless guy just takes a fucking dump right in front of you?  That's great.  How do you not wipe?  Dude.  What's he going to wipe?  You're homeless.  So what?  They don't have to have a room over their head to wipe.  Did you see Tippi Tom's underwear?  That's what he wipes with.  Have you seen it yet?  As he walks.  Yeah, of course.  Hey, is Bill here today?  He'll be here in a little bit.  Oh, good.  Wow.  Awesome.  We've got so many things to do today. 
[00:51:30]  Tippi Tom, homeless assault on the media.  Yeah, well, now you're just talking gold.  That would be...  Oh, yeah, let me tell you, people.  Let's get him in here.  We love Tippi Tom.  How many contestants do we have for the Eggnog drinking contest?  Twelve?  Twelve.  I mean, if you want to pick and winnow it down, at least this will make the vomit smell better.  Yeah, if they're here, they ought to be in the contest.  Eggnog vomit will make the studio smell better after Tippi Tom is in here.  Believe me.  All right, we should make a wall, like a tape wall or something. 
[00:52:00]  They could hang out all in this area.  No one comes to this side of that edge of the console.  No one.  Here he is.  All right, Tippi Tom.  Favorite people in all the world.  The original.  The original.  The original.  There's all these fake Tippi Toms out there, but I'm the real Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  There's a bunch of people out there thinking of me, but they're not.  But they're not you. 
[00:52:30]  I am me.  I didn't know you were a Notre Dame fan.  Um.  Firefighting Irish sweatshirt on.  How could you read that, O.P.?  Well, how could I hear what he's...  Can you hear?  A little bit.  You can hear, right?  Turn it up a little bit.  Turn it up a little bit.  There you go.  You got to turn it up.  Okay, now I can hear.  What color was that sweatshirt originally?  Because it's now dark brown.  Was it white?  No.  It was blue.  Now, Tippi Tom. 
[00:53:00]  Tippi Tom.  What?  We had a guy come in here the other day.  Yeah.  He's an Indian fellow.  You know, not the ones with the dot on the head Indian.  The American Indian type.  And he said...  Also known as...  Are you listening to me, Tom?  Are you talking about the guy that didn't make it today?  I don't know.  But he said that you gave him a leather jacket.  Yeah.  Why would you give...  My long one.  Yeah.  Right down the air.  That was a nice jacket.  Why would you give that away? 
[00:53:30]  I don't know.  Because he wanted it.  Yeah, but...  So we traded.  That's all.  Oh, you traded.  What did you get?  I got that jacket.  A blowjob.  You got another jacket?  You guys just trade jackets?  I got a blowjob out of the deal, but I can't say it or I can't say it.  No, you can say that.  It's satellite.  Yeah, you can say whatever you want.  Timmy Tom, how's the AIDS doing?  Huh?  You look great.  How's the AIDS?  How's the what?  The AIDS.  Don't you have the AIDS?  You got the ninja?  The hiv?  You once told us you got the ninja. 
[00:54:00]  The high five.  You got the high five, right?  The high five.  Yeah.  The HIV?  No, I don't.  You don't?  No, I don't.  I thought I was sick as a dog, right?  You cured it?  No, a doctor, I went to the hospital about three months ago, and I said, check me out.  Something's wrong with me.  And he says, you don't have hepatitis C. You don't have HIV.  There's nothing wrong with you. 
[00:54:30]  He said, now, you get out of my hospital.  And I thought I was dying.  I had a cold.  You had a cold.  That was it.  Just the sniffles.  Well, I'm a bit of a hypochondriac.  I have not a hypochondriac.  I don't know.  If I sneeze, I think I'm dying.  Yeah.  Tippi, I must say, you are a lot more coherent today than you have been.  I don't think you've been drinking that much today. 
[00:55:00]  No.  No.  No, I've been drinking very little.  Yeah?  I hope I'll be drinking some more.  We'll see what happens.  Because, yeah, last time you were in here, you kept running out of the studio telling us all to go fuck ourselves.  I did that?  Yeah.  And you were very belligerent and angry.  Do you remember dancing on the stage?  All right.  I'm so sorry about that.  Oh, no need to apologize.  You know.  Do you remember dancing on the stage for us last time? 
[00:55:30]  I think I was dancing.  Yeah.  You had.  You want me dancing more?  No, you were showing us what you were calling Golden Buns.  I'm the original Golden Buns.  There's a bunch of fake ones out there.  You really?  I am the real Golden Buns.  And I remember that.  You were doing that.  And then you fell asleep outside.  Probably doing it.  In the chair.  Are you excited about the homeless shopping spree that we're doing?  Am I sad about it? 
[00:56:00]  No.  No, no.  Excited.  Excited.  Yeah.  You remember the last one you went on with us?  Yes.  I got a sweater, a pair of expensive shoes.  Yeah.  I didn't know what I wanted.  How long did that stuff actually last there and stay with you?  Quite a while.  It did?  Yeah.  Didn't get stolen?  I was real happy.  No.  Yeah?  Nobody steals from the tippy tom.  You're like top of the heap.  You steal from other people.  Well, no.  I don't eat other people's shit anyway. 
[00:56:30]  I want my own.  And, uh, no.  Do you have a shopping cart?  What do you carry your shit in?  Do I have a shopping cart?  Yeah.  Uh, no.  What do you carry all your possessions in?  Because I noticed some of the homeless guys got the shopping carts.  Some have duffel bags.  I don't carry much.  I travel right.  It's just what's in your pockets?  Maybe a backpack if I get one.  What if it gets chilly?  What do you do?  Uh, what do you sleep? 
[00:57:00]  Uh, Subway.  Subway?  Yeah.  It's warm.  It's warm down there?  Oh, yeah.  And the train, when it goes, rocks you like a cradle.  I get some good sleep.  The train goes by and kind of rocks you to sleep.  Mm-hmm.  What neighborhoods do you take the trains into?  Uh, uh, mostly I take the L train because I like that.  Uh, the L train just goes back and forth, back and forth.  Right.  You don't get rousted, though, to get the fuck off?  Oh.  No?  No.  Not late at night because, you know, nobody cares. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Um, if it's, like, rush hour, if I'm laying down on the bench.  Yeah, there's a problem.  Uh, yeah, you gotta get up.  I gotta tell you, Anthony, he's brilliant because the L train just goes east and west in Manhattan  to one good neighborhood to the next good neighborhood.  Yeah.  But if you fall asleep on a train going uptown, that could be a problem.  That could be a problem.  You could wake up.  But he's just going back and forth, back and forth, uh, west to east and, uh, vicey-versy.  Plus, it's a, it's a nice new trains. 
[00:58:00]  Oh.  Yes.  And I, I like the seats better.  You know, I mean, I, I prefer that, you know, I, I prefer that train more.  Yeah.  I mean, the other, the other trains are cool.  I like the old ones, but they're rickety.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It takes me two months.  Tippi, what about living?  You know, Dre runs through.  All right, we got it.  What about living underground?  Um, what's, what's going on underground?  Like, down in the subway?  The mole, way down, way down.  Way down.  Way down.  Way down.  Way down.  Where the mole people are.  Where you could go down, like, five or six stories. 
[00:58:30]  Where, where the moles are?  The mole people, they build, like, little, uh, houses down there out of plywood, and, uh,  they get electricity, and they live in, like, little communes.  Rats as big as dogs.  They eat them.  Well, the only mole town I know up here in New York, I know them in Nevada, plenty of them,  because it's nice weather.  Here in New York, it's a little rough.  Yeah.  Uh.  But do you ever go underground?  Hmm?  Do you ever go underground in these old tunnels and stuff that, uh, aren't used anymore?  Underground?  Underground, under the streets. 
[00:59:00]  And live.  Not on a regular subway.  Poor Jimmy.  Well, where am I going to go without the subway?  Oh, I forget it.  How, how, how, how can I get around town?  Never mind.  You know, well, underground, like, dig a hole somewhere?  No, you'll pop like a manhole cover up, or you, uh, or you go down into a subway access  tunnel.  I'm not that brave.  Nah, huh?  It's scary down there, right?  We got rats down there.  And it's scary, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I get scared.  It's not that bad, yeah.  I am not super mad.  So now, what are you looking to get, uh, during the homeless shopping spree this year? 
[00:59:30]  What do you need?  What are you looking for Santa to bring you?  I want, uh, a Cadillac.  Well, that can be a problem.  I could give you Elo's number.  Perhaps he could get you one piece at a time.  No, I'm just talking about a little model.  I just wanted to have a model.  Oh, you want a little model of a Cadillac?  So I can put it together.  All right.  What about clothes?  You need, uh, new shoes or some underwear, probably?  Well, I would, definitely.  Yeah, you could always use some underwear.  That goes without doubt. 
[01:00:00]  Uh, some new, new socks, too.  Yeah.  Anthony, I gotta interrupt for a second.  And I want a brand new scarf.  A scarf.  I think I may have been wrong about the L train.  Paul on Long Island.  Paul?  Hey, hey, Pippi, the fucking L train goes, like, Easton Parkway and over there.  That fucking area sucks.  Wait, where, it goes to what area?  It goes, like, across Williamsburg Bridge, like, into fucking, uh, Brooklyn.  I didn't think it did.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Oh, it does?  I thought it just stayed in, uh, Manhattan, just went back and forth.  Nah, it goes, like, Easton Parkway and fucking, so, like, frigate the tunes over there. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, my God, that's some awful areas.  I apologize.  Ha-ha.  I've taken the L train a bunch, and I thought it just went kind of just, uh, you know, one  side of Manhattan to the other.  All right.  All right.  I'm sorry, Paul.  All right, man.  Thanks for correcting me.  Nah, the L train go for Manhattan.  Over there.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Tippi, have you, uh, been singing any songs lately?  Well, what do you want to hear?  What do you got?  Uh, what have you been just singing, uh, around? 
[01:01:00]  Are you singing on the streets?  What have I been singing lately?  Yeah.  I've been stuck on Frank Sinatra.  Some Sinatra.  Of course.  Well, maybe he can, uh, go over to Frank's place and, uh, belt out a tune.  Ooh.  But I've also been thinking about Tom Jones.  Ah, let's hear some Tom Jones.  If I can get it right.  All right.  Which one?  Uh, I'm too shy.  Oh, don't be shy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Just close your eyes. 
[01:01:30]  Close your eyes.  Close your eyes.  I'm going to say the lyrics.  Close your eyes.  She's a lady.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady.  Talking about my pretty lady, but the lady is mine.  Go something like that.  Right, right.  Yeah.  How about, you know, Delilah?  Delilah, uh, yeah, but I don't know lyrics.  No?  I mean, I do, but I don't.  How about It's Not Unusual?  It's not unusual to be in love.  Tom Jones with anyone. 
[01:02:00]  It's not unusual.  Something like that.  Anyone.  That's not unusual.  Something like that.  That's cool.  You got most of it.  This is all just getting...  We're just gathering up Drew Boogie's material right now.  This is what we're doing right now.  You watch how that works itself into a brilliant song.  How about Frank Sinatra?  Yeah, a little Sinatra.  We all love Frank Sinatra. 
[01:02:30]  He's timeless.  Which one do you want to hear?  Do you have one you know the most of?  Well, I love them all, actually.  You know New York, New York?  Okay, we'll do something close to that.  All right.  Jersey, Jersey?  No, no, no, no.  A little joke.  We'll start spreading the news.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  I'm leaving today.  I'm going to be a part of it. 
[01:03:00]  New York, New York.  If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere.  It's up to you, New York.  New York.  That's my version.  No, that's Dio's version.  I've never heard Dio sing that song, but do a good cover of that.  It's amazing you say, if I can make it here.  Let me sing another song.  All right.  Yeah, let's hear one more.  All right.  Hey, where's your buddy Graywolf, by the way? 
[01:03:30]  We're looking for him.  You didn't hear that song he wrote about you?  He was lost.  Did you hear that song he wrote about you?  Uh, I think it goes like this.  Uh, yeah.  Song he wrote about me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Uh, where is my Tommy?  Where is my tippy-tom?  No tippy-tom to be found.  I'm so sad because I can't find my tippy-tom.  He's nowhere to be around. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Jesus, you're like the other guy from Wham.  That's good.  You know, the two guys, Graywolf and him.  All right.  He behaves like George Michael.  All right.  All right.  Another one.  One more.  You are an itchy guy, aren't you, Tom?  Yeah, what do you want?  I just noticed you scratching yourself.  I got dry skin.  All right, lift up your sweatshirt.  What do you want?  I wish you guys would chip in and buy me some lotion. 
[01:04:30]  You want some lotion?  We got lotion here.  We usually use it on girls, but we'll lotion you.  Someone lotion him up.  Lift up your sweatshirt.  I want to see what you're itching.  Really nothing, itching.  Just dry skin.  Yeah.  We were expecting scabs and stuff.  But last time.  Happens every year.  Last time you had a lot of mite bites on you or something.  Uh, yeah.  I still got some.  Yeah, but you just pulled up your shirt.  At least you don't have them all over your body.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:05:00]  How about one more song, Tippy Tom?  One more song.  One more Diddy.  All right.  One more good one?  Yeah.  All right.  What do you want to hear?  Uh, let's see.  Another one of the...  You know any 60s groovy music from the 60s?  Oh, yeah.  Something like that?  Well, uh, um...  Jefferson Airplane, Simon and Garfunkel.  The Rolling Stones, perhaps?  Yeah, let's see.  Something in the 60s.  Or anything.  Anything.  The Doors.  Riders on the Storm. 
[01:05:30]  Something like that.  It's the Riders on the Storm is the next line.  To be on the...  Something like that.  You know, Come on, Baby, Light My Fire?  Come on, Baby, Light My Fire.  Trying to sit the night on fire!  Okay.  Any more requests?  All right, Tippy Tom, everyone.  All right.  You'll be around for the rest of the show.  Hang on.  Have a good voice.  Drew, I hope that helped you out.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm taking a break. 
[01:06:00]  Take a little break there, Tippy Tom.  To all my fans.  You've done a great job today.  Great performance.  I'm taking a break.  Huh?  The other guy, too.  You've got to meet him.  Oh, we've got to meet the other guy that keeps going on.  All right, Tippy Tom, you can hang out over there.  Am I off the stage?  Yeah, you're off the stage.  Yeah, yeah.  Just take the headphones off.  Just for a little while, you're off the stage.  I was finally getting into it, man.  You'll be back.  You'll be back.  It's like an intermission.  All right.  I'll be taking a break.  Act one, act two.  You know how it goes.  See you later. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  He looks like that old comedian that...  Dick Gregory?  No.  No, no, no.  From the 70s.  Yeah.  He was in Car Wash.  Yeah.  Oh, Franklin and Jive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  My name is Spoon, so I'm Spoon.  Hi.  Hey, Spoon.  Yeah, hey.  Spoon.  Yes.  As in Spoon Man.  Yeah, Spoon Man.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah, Spoon.  Why the pink hat, first of all?  Pink hat, the guys like me.  Guys like my pink hat.  Give me a lot of money.  Give me a lot of money.  Oh, really?  Yes. 
[01:07:00]  So is the pink hat like a signal?  It says I'm ready.  So you're ready?  Yeah.  Ready for what?  Ready to have a good time.  Ready to have a good time.  Anyone who has a shoe that needs, give me some money.  So if someone gives you a little money, you'll give a little favor, let's say.  I give a little favor.  Yeah.  A little favor.  What type of favors do you offer?  Yeah.  Well, all favors like...  You could say it at Satellite Radio.  Yeah, I do.  All favors like tickle pants and show underwear.  Show the underwear.  Show the underwear. 
[01:07:30]  Just only show the underwear.  Only show the underwear.  Yeah, only show the underwear.  That's your thing?  You only show the underwear?  Yeah, only show the underwear is my thing.  Only show the underwear.  And then people give you money to see your underwear?  See my underwear, yes.  All right, someone's got to get money.  I mean, come on.  How much does that cost, sir?  Jesus.  It costs us $24.  $24.  To see underpants?  Wow.  The underpants.  Wow.  That doesn't seem very...  That's not a good deal.  Wait, Spoon made me worry because he was brought in by Keith and he may have to be careful  he doesn't want to say the wrong thing.  Yeah, right.  Well, I don't care what I say.  Me and Keith are partners anyway. 
[01:08:00]  There you go.  I don't care what I say.  He's the force that has gone downhill.  So, you know, well, I guess other favors would probably include, I don't know, DJ.  The old DJ.  Maybe suck a dick.  No, none of that.  No?  Well, maybe the opposite end of doing that, the opposite end of doing that.  Oh, maybe fuck you in the ass.  No, none of that.  Maybe they will suck your dick. 
[01:08:30]  Sounds right.  Sounds right.  All right.  Sounds right.  All right.  Well, that's a good end of the bargain to be on.  You've got to be on any end of that bargain.  Yes.  Are you packing?  No, no packing.  No packing either.  No packing.  No, I mean packing in your pants.  Like, you've got a big tool.  Yeah, I've got a big tool.  He's actually, he's known to spend money on things like that.  Oh, I've got to be shy.  Who cares?  We're all friends.  Drives around in a Saturn.  No.  No.  Beep, beep. 
[01:09:00]  Whoa.  What, are you talking to a mirror?  No.  Now, Spoon, what happened to the hand?  I see you got a little injury.  Yeah.  What happened?  These two girls beat me up.  Two girls beat you up?  Yeah, beat me up.  What happened?  Well, I was out on a limb and started smoking.  Smoking a little weed?  A little weed.  Right.  Yeah, and I just took the cash and they beat me up.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  I got, I'm not getting this. 
[01:09:30]  Two chicks.  Two chicks, yeah.  And they wanted to buy something?  Yeah, they want to buy.  They want to buy.  You were smoking weed.  They wanted to buy some weed.  Buy some weed.  I stole it.  They pulled some money out.  Yeah, I stole it.  And you grabbed their money.  Yeah, I grabbed their money.  And what happened to running?  You didn't run?  Well, I couldn't run.  Why?  Because they had me tied down.  And they beat, were they white chicks or black chicks?  One white, one black chick.  Wow.  It's nice to see the races work together to beat up the homeless. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, well.  And then they chased you as far as, I guess, you could run.  Yes.  And then broke your arm?  Broke my arm.  Fractured it.  Broke it.  Fractured it.  How did they do that?  Twisting it?  Or did they?  They kicked me.  They were kicking you.  They must have been laughing their bitch asses off as they were beating the shit out of you.  Yeah, well, maybe so.  Wow.  You are a horrible thief.  Yeah.  How did they not steal blood from two chicks?  Maybe I am.  My friends always called me a thief because I always, always, always liked to catch them. 
[01:10:30]  They catch them in a lie or something like that.  So they say, well, man, you're a thief.  You know, you're a thief.  Yeah.  How long have you been homeless, brother?  Well, I've been homeless for a while, a couple of years.  A couple of years?  Yes.  What were you doing before you were homeless?  Well, my aunt brought me up here.  Brought me up here, of course, from North Carolina.  From North Carolina?  Yes, I am from North Carolina.  So you came up?  Came up.  Came up crazy.  Did you have a job and a place to live or something?  No, I didn't have a job. 
[01:11:00]  I didn't have a job at all.  What do I need to do?  And then you were just, what, like, uh...  Hanging loose.  Like, hanging, hanging, washing weed and stuff like that.  Hanging loose.  Just hanging loose.  And then one day you realized, holy shit, I have nowhere to go that has a roof and walls?  So I came to New York.  Wow.  Why wouldn't you go somewhere warm?  Like, I don't get...  Oh, I like to stay warm.  I like to stay warm.  I don't get New York homeless.  And warm make it, it make it low down.  You know, you gotta get up.  I'm gonna get up, you know.  Oh, so if it's warm, you guys just sleep all fucking day.  Just sleep all right. 
[01:11:30]  So now in the wintertime, it gets cool.  You gotta get your ass up and start getting out there.  There's a...  Even in the homeless, there's a work ethic.  I like that.  It's like, you know, I gotta get up and earn.  Yeah, right.  All right.  And what's your...  You have a gimmick or anything besides having girls beat you up?  What's your talent?  What do you do to get a little bit of money?  What do you got?  When I get a little money, I got a little thing.  I say something like, um...  I have everything for you that you need.  Everything that you own is mine.  And I say stuff like that. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then I say, ho!  You do all right?  Yeah.  Then I make a muscle maybe like that or something like this.  You do all right?  What do you pull in a day, would you say?  How much?  How many bucks?  Some days I can pull $100.  $100?  And that's good for you for the day?  That's good for me for the day.  And what do you do with the money?  Drink?  I drink.  A lot?  Do the weed?  Yeah, I do the weed.  Weed, what?  And last priority is food and...  Food?  Food.  Without food.  Where do you get your food? 
[01:12:30]  My underwear.  That's why I keep my underwear right.  Underwear?  I keep my underwear right.  You keep your underwear right?  Yeah, I got to keep that right.  That's good.  That's rare amongst the homeless.  That's a good thing.  And where do you get your food?  Well, my food comes from the shelter.  I buy it.  Most of the time I buy it.  Most of the time I buy it.  I buy it.  But sometimes you go to the shelter?  Yeah, sometimes I go to the shelter.  You need like a day.  I hear those places are pretty fucking tough, though, huh?  Yeah, I go to the shelter.  The place is pretty tough.  Got a lot of tough guys there.  Yeah.  Well, long enough.  You can't go into a shelter with anything that's worth stealing or they'll take it from you.  That's right.  That's what I hear.  You got to have everything hidden. 
[01:13:00]  Stuck in your pants.  Hidden on you.  Maybe get yourself cleaned up.  Get something to eat.  Get a good night's sleep.  And then you're out of there.  I'm out of there.  Yeah, that's right.  What a life.  Jesus Christ, man.  Yeah, it's a beautiful life.  How did it get like that, though?  What happened in your head?  Didn't you realize that in order to not be homeless,  maybe, you know,  got to kind of fit in a little bit,  a little job,  a little pay in the rent kind of thing?  Yeah, okay.  I'll be home.  I'll be home.  I'll be home.  I'll be home.  I'll be home.  But what happened?  You just said, fuck it?  Yeah, I came home from North Carolina. 
[01:13:30]  I said, fuck it.  I said, fuck it.  Other people have moved from North Carolina to New York.  Yeah.  And they've kind of made a life.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  I just don't know what happens.  Are you a little crazy?  No, I'm not crazy.  Most, I'm homesick.  Mostly.  You can't go back?  Yes, I can.  I'll go back.  Anytime I want to.  I'm homesick.  I need to be somewhere cold.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll be somewhere cold.  Do you sing or anything?  Yeah, I got a little line I sing, of course.  Yeah, let's hear you sing. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, because Tippy was singing.  This song here is a crazy song.  All right.  A North Carolina song.  Let's hear it.  That was my...  Yeah.  If you search your world,  search your world,  and you can't find no one like you,  you can find me,  find me,  the beautiful love,  beautiful love,  twin.  So I'm a twin.  I'm a twin.

He works at a slaughterhouse for the pigs and stuff like that.  Works at a slaughterhouse? 
[01:15:00]  Yes, works at a slaughterhouse.  Wow.  For the pigs and like cut up pigs.  In New York or down south?  Down south.  Of course, down south.  They only do that down south.  Down south is hot.  It's hot down south.  Yeah, that's hot.  Yeah, very hot down south.  All right, well, we like Spoon.  Spoon's a good...  Spoon with a pink hat and likes to show his underwear.  How old a gentleman are you, Spoon?  I'm 45.  45?  45.  You homeless guys look great at your age.  It's amazing.  You don't recognize...  Do you recognize him, Spoon? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, I don't know him.  All right, it's Nathaniel.  Nathaniel.  Yeah.  Nice to meet you, Nathaniel.  Oh, look at that.  He's shy.  He wants to give you money so he can see your underwear.  He's shy.  Oh, wow.  He's just shy.  Could you please leave Dan alone?  Look at poor Dan.  He just does not want to be part of this bit at all.  At all.  Dan's going to snap a bit.  Yes, well...  I think it's going to be one day.  How about...  How about before 10 o'clock? 
[01:16:00]  December 2nd.  Here's the apprentice audio.  Oh, that's right.  We're interviewing the...  We'll make it right...  Oh, we'll make it right, Dave.  We'll make it right, Dave.  All right.  Well, Spoon, thank you.  Hang out, have a beer, a coffee, whatever you want.  Yes.  People say he sounds like Jimi Hendrix when he talks.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's a compliment, right?  There you go.  All right, my friend.  You can take the headphones off so you don't throw your neck out.  And thanks for dropping in. 
[01:16:30]  Thank you, too.  Nice seeing you, Spoon.  Hang out, go into our lovely lounge out here, and have fun.  Enjoy.  There you go.  Spoon, the homeless guy.  Homeless guy.  Dude, tippy-tom smells so much like piss.  You know what that is.  Piss.  Yes.  All right, listen.  We're running out of show already.  The Lysol cans.  Did I see someone bring in a case of Lysol?  Oh, yeah.  We now are buying it by the case?  Yeah.  We have so much show to do. 
[01:17:00]  Holy this fucking show, man.  And not enough time, because we got the eggnog drinking contest.  Yes, we do.  We're going to take a quick break.  We're going to talk to Pat from Monaki, the reigning champion, see what he's all about.  Right.  And then we've got to start bringing in these new guys.  I mean, there are some big boys out there.  You see the guy that looks like Patrice?  Yeah.  In the back?  Holy.  Where is that?  I thought that was Patrice stopping by to say hi.  I can't see.  It's one of the dudes for the eggnog drinking contest.  Oh, big guy.  A large gentleman in the back with a blue hat.  Absolutely large.  That's going to be nice watching him woof.  I want to get some weights. 
[01:17:30]  Can you guys?  Yeah.  What?  When we come back from break, I just want to know how much some of these guys weigh.  Do they scale?  Well, they'll tell us.  I thought you wanted them to start working out.  They're not going to lie.  That guy's at least 400, 500 pounds.  Really?  Easily.  Right.  Right.  Wow, there's a lot of cursing going on out there.  All right.  Quick break.  We'll continue.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right.  Here we go.  This is a story about a man, and he always was so lonely at night, but his voice is rowdy. 
[01:18:00]  You can hear it all through his train station, and I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tiffy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You laid that night, and now you have nowhere to go. 
[01:18:30]  My money's gone and off for all my friends.  And the cop says to me, hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says, and you don't have an angel.  And he says, that ain't you.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  Shelter me from the falling rain. 
[01:19:00]  You have all news.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have all news.  This is my life.  This is my life.  And now, living with so much pain. 
[01:19:30]  And just a little peace.  And now, another holiday reading from Charles Dickens' immortal classic, A Christmas Carol.  When Scrooge awoke.  When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark that looking out of bed, he could see.  Meddling carolers every bloody year.  The Humbug. 
[01:20:00]  Ramone, fetch the nail gun.  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Where's Pat from Winnocky?  We've got to get him in here right away. 
[01:20:30]  Today is the eggnog drinking contest.  The return of the eggnog drinking contest.  This is really where we got to know Pat.  Yeah.  Last year.  This is where Pat became a star.  You never know when you as a listener are going to become a star.  Look at Pat now.  He's demanding the right headphones.  He doesn't want homeless headphones.  Look at him.  He's got demands now.  Yeah, last year is where Pat really made his bones here on the show.  Yes.  And we had seen him previously at a few appearances and get-togethers, things like that, that we  were doing. 
[01:21:00]  But that was really where we got to talk with him a while.  And a year later, still learning new things about him.  Can I start by saying you look terrific in that brand new Opie and Anthony t-shirt?  Oh, yes.  I believe it was designed by my brother.  Your brother.  I haven't even seen these yet.  Oh, that is the winter model with the long sleeves.  That really bugs me.  I like that.  Yeah, that is really nice.  My brother did a good job.  Well, if you need Christmas gifts, we got Opie and Anthony merchandise.  Just go to opieandanthony.com.  I haven't seen that, though.  It came out great.  Long sleeve Opie and Anthony shirts. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  Very nice.  Pat, very funny on the message boards and on MySpace and stuff.  He sends these comments because I said once he reached 1,000 friends, I was kicking  him off of my top eight.  Yeah.  Which I did at like 950.  Yeah, I know.  I threw your ass off.  I figured you had momentum going.  Premature.  Yeah, I had to throw you off.  That's somebody else.  My buddy Adam Ferrara had I get on there.  But he sends me this little message and it's got the picture of Nazis shooting the old  guy. 
[01:22:00]  And he goes, but I'm essential to the MySpace efforts.  And then, yeah.  I'm funny in print.  Hey, am I one of your friends on MySpace?  Who, what?  Am I one of your friends on MySpace?  Yes, you are.  Okay, good.  He's ending up his big head.  His big headed picture, MySpace picture is ending up on so many people's lists.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You go there and just see it.  And now you're up to what?  Big floating head of unfunny.  Pat.  Let's get right into this.  Feeling good?  I was feeling good until a few minutes ago. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  We know it is.  And that's what we're going to get into here.  Pat, you only weighed 310 pounds?  That's correct.  Yeah, I got the weights of all the competitors.  A svelte 310.  We got guys as small as me, 170 pounds, and we got a guy here, Will, who's 450 pounds that's  going to be in the contest.  But you were feeling very confident, ready to go.  Cocky, as you were.  Ready to take all these guys on from all over the country, and then what happened?  Explain.  And then we'll get into this a little bit.  I heard a little rumor that Mr. Eric Badlands Booker was entering the contest. 
[01:23:00]  A lot of people might go, who is that?  I believe he's number three in the world of competitive eating, ranked in the IFOCE.  And you're number 15.  Number 15.  It's not that big a deal.  You know something?  You pretty much were the ringer.  You were the champ last year by such a large margin, too. 
[01:23:30]  That is correct.  So you come in here feeling all cocky, and then this guy walks in, and now what?  Now how do you feel?  Like dog shit.  Do you really think he's going to win?  Well, there's a good chance.  Is there a difference between eating?  Is drinking in competitive eating?  Do they actually do liquid-based competitions?  Actually, at this point, no, I believe not. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  But I believe the difference is in the time factor.  There's no real time.  It's not like a 10-minute contest or a 12-minute contest.  It's going to go every minute, and it's going to be all about capacity.  Process of elimination here.  People will just be dropping out.  Yeah.  And it's, yeah, like you said, not time.  So you can't look at the clock and go, I've got to pace myself for 15 minutes.  Yeah, only that minute, but that's not a concern with us pro-eaters.  And we have seen you blow the crowd away.  It's going to be very competitive today. 
[01:24:30]  I'm excited to see how this professional is now going to be.  I thought we were just going to have fun for a couple hours, and Pat would take the title home.  Yeah.  It was all going to be one big goof, but it's a real competition.  Pat's a real competition.  He's a little nervous.  He is a little nervous now.  Hey, where is this guy?  I want to say hi to him, man.  He's a big fella.  He's a star.  He is huge.  This guy's a star.  I've seen him on TV.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen him shoving all kinds of food in his face on television.  Entering the studio, Eric Badlands Booker.  Here he is.  Oh, holy shit.  All right. 
[01:25:00]  Pat, you're so fucked.  Holy big motherfucker.  He's 110 pounds heavier than Pat.  What's good, New York City?  Oh, what's good worldwide?  We on satellite.  Yeah, that's right.  What's up?  Oh, man, are you a ringer.  You are a big guy.  No one's beating you, man.  Nah, size doesn't matter.  I feel small at this point.  Size doesn't matter.  You know, this is Pat House.  This is his tree.  I'm just sitting in it.  You know what I'm saying?  Were you in the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest?  Yeah, I've been there a few years.  You know, since 97, I've been, you know, pitching compared to VMA.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  Wow.  Well, look, the guy that wins it every year is a little small guy.  The little Asian guys that win are tiny.  Yeah, what's up with him?  Yeah, it's like, what you going to do when the guy next to you is about 5'2 and his name  is Takaru?  I mean, don't you want to punch that guy?  A lot of people say I should just, you know, give him a nudge.  Just eat him.  What's next to him, you know?  You should put him in a hot dog bun and just shove him in your mouth.  I could probably eat 50 hot dogs and him, but, you know, it's easier said than done.  But I'm working on it, though.  And he's a Long Island boy, right?  Yeah, yeah, from Southern New York.  Right on.  And you got a rap album? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, I got two rap albums.  There's one that's out now called Hungry and Focus.  This is the first ever competitive-eating-themed hip-hop, and my follow-up just came out yesterday.  It's called Hungry and Focus 2, The Ingestion Engine.  It's 18 cuts of just gritty, competitive-eating-themed hip-hop.  You know, you can hear tracks on a lot of websites, beautifulbryan.com, badlandsbooker.com,  and trenchowoman.com.  All right.  Well, we've got to play one of these things on the show.  Oh, yeah.  Hell yeah.  Which one do you want us to play?  Give us something that people could really get into. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, play the sweet science off the first album, you know, because that's the one that  everybody knows and likes, and then, you know, we'll hit them with something off the new album  later on in the show.  Oh, you got it ready?  Look at you, two albums.  Oh, wow.  Look at this guy.  Michigan's checking in.  Pat, your 15 minutes are finally up, fatty.  Ow.  Oh.  Oh.  They're trying to try.  Sir, you're being cruel and insensitive.  Yeah, they're in deep trouble, Pat.  And he's not even the... 
[01:27:00]  I'm in deep eggnog.  I'm starting to doubt...  I'm starting to doubt whether I'll win.  I believe I'm eggnogstick.  I'll let him have that one.  I've been playing that one for a week.  Yeah, you absolutely had all the confidence.  It was louder.  I'm eggnogstick.  There it comes.  Rancher.  You've come back.  That's what we love about Patty.  He writes this stuff, too, ahead of time.  Mmm, Rachel. 
[01:27:30]  My eggnog's come back up.  He comes in here prepared.  And we should also mention that Pat from Menarche will be spending Christmas Day with Anthony and his lovely girlfriend.  Oh, now we have a bunch of people.  It's an extravaganza of people.  Yeah, we figured Pat, from his tragic story of his family, or lack thereof, last appearance he was on the show, that he should share in the Christmas experience with some people who were there, good company, out at a restaurant here in Manhattan. 
[01:28:00]  And Pat then went on to invite about 15 other fucking people along to this thing.  So now it's a whole big to-do.  But I will still show up.  On Long Island?  No.  It's here in New York City.  All right.  Going to a fine restaurant.  We got the song, Badlands Booker.  Eric Badlands Booker.  Let's give it a listen.  Let's take a listen.  Diets out of competitive eating. 
[01:28:30]  Hoo-ah.  Hoo-ah.  Julian is on the boards.  Badlands on the vocal cords.  We're going to rule this world.  Thought you should know.  And check it out.  Yo, it's a go.  I'll be that top-grudgetator extraordinaire.  Want to eat to the beat in the flash of flair.  Eat you out of house or home.  No thought or care.  Fridge empty cup is bare.  The one that rip snacks out of school backpacks.  He's looking over the showers.  Like Michael Jackson.  Son, I'll be there.  Eating like Pac-Man.  Bigger than your candy dish. 
[01:29:00]  Yo, it's a rap, son.  Yo, who be that?  Badlands, baby.  No offense or maybe it's devour like crazy.  Yo, I'm like the dog in the Looney Tune, baby.  I guess the steak be like, what?  You don't crazy?  Yeah, superhero with a fork and spoon.  Praying like X-Men in the danger room.  Like a pirate.  Lower epicureum booms.  Quicker than soon.  Praying, massing, hate, and doom.  On all trash talking, son of a gun.  They don't know I'm buffet enemy number one.  Terrence goes take foot and keep running from.  Better ask someone, who's that?  Like Barry Crumb.  They call me Badlands Booker.  Superfly like Ronald Neal and Snooker.  Putting a pressure on, eaters like cookers. 
[01:29:30]  Put on a show for pressin' on, lookers.  Bob and weave, shake and bake and shook.  Yeah, good like coffee with the cream and sugar.  You know my name, I got that thing.  For cramming food down my esophical drain.  Debonair, short and air, cooking, pee and eat.  And bob and weave and shake and bake past your crease.  Never heave and green, so lose my chin.  Straight to the top scene.  Greatness conceived, out my pores.  Do this for you or yours.  Blow your doors.  Eat rubber with no pores.  Want to post some buffets in grocery stores.  Wash your lemons when I eat, cause I'm just like yours.  Yeah, all day, baby, all day.  Hungry folk is the only way.  Sit down and just proceed to pray. 
[01:30:00]  Thank God for the grub, then eat away.  Less grace like Reuben stuttered.  Time to chew, no words of being uttered.  Just hear the noise, sometimes the poem.  But I think it's beautiful, find it my duty to.  Put a hurtin' on the food establishment.  Odensees me and the man is adamant.  Put up his clothes signed in, now hurry.  They call his supply to us kinda early.  And I know I'm about to be banned when he's like, don't come back, understand?  You eat like a sumo can't beat the man.  Around the fifth plate he realizes, ooh, yeah.  They call me Badlands, woke up.  Superfly like Bruno Neal is hooked up. 
[01:30:30]  Put the pressure on, he just like crookers.  Put on the show for press in on the cup.  Wow, I like this.  That's not bad, bro.  That's not bad.  There's a taste right there.  You gotta give the plug again, Eric.  You'll kick it old school, my friend.  Yeah, man.  You know, old school, new school.  I've been doing this since, you know, way back in the days, you know.  But if you want to get that, it's badlandsbooker.com, IFOCE.com.  IFOCE.com or badlandsbooker.com.  How's your cholesterol?  My cholesterol is good, believe it or not.  You know, it's 150, you know. 
[01:31:00]  150.  It's 150.  How the fuck does that happen?  Hey, during the off season, I stick close to my trainer.  You know, I can't be, you know, munching on fast food, you know, in between contests.  So I eat my fruits and my vegetables, and I drink my water, and, you know, I look forward  to the contest to just eat all I can, you know what I'm saying?  That's amazing.  Are you on the medicine for that?  No, no, no, no.  I'm good.  But the thing about it is that I do, once in a while, I'd love to go to a good buffet  and just, you know, make the owner nervous.  They must just shit.  Like, buffet, all you can eat. 
[01:31:30]  No, you can't come in.  No.  All you can eat buffet, and he walks in, it's just, forget about it.  Yeah, man.  All right.  Over, John.  And Tribal Rage from Whackbag, that's nice.  Remind Pat of how little he has by immersing him in Anthony's wealth for a day.  That is not what I'm trying to do here.  Let's go to Eric in Philly.  Eric.  Pat, don't let them psych you out.  You own that room, pal.  That's right, Pat.  Hey, there you go.  That's right, Pat. 
[01:32:00]  Hey, Ove, how about a side bet?  Yeah.  The winner throws up in the loser's mouth.  Oh, my God.  Nobody wins with that.  Nobody wins.  Thank you, Eric.  Go ahead.  Yeah, Pat, don't forget, you're still the champ.  Yep.  You're officially still the champ.  It's got to be taken.  Can we talk to some of the other guys real fast?  We want to get this contest rolling at 9 o'clock.  Get it rolling.  Because I think this is going to go a long way today.  Oh, boy.  You know the deal, right, Eric?  Yeah.  It's double shots of eggnog, one a minute until you puke. 
[01:32:30]  Until you either puke or tap out.  Somebody dies or something.  Right.  Last man standing.  Why are these cups a lot bigger?  Are those the cups from last year?  Oh, there's a line on them.  Okay.  I got scared.  Okay.  Me, too.  I got scared.  I got scared.  Everyone's got their cups with their names on it.  Dude, do you weigh more than Eric?  No.  450.  You're the 450 guy.  You're 450.  He's got a different build.  A little more.  He's got a different build.  You're a little shorter, but you're kind of a little wider. 
[01:33:00]  I'm 6'2".  You're 6'2"?  No.  Yeah.  If you're taller than 6'2", my man.  Nah, man.  How tall are you, Eric?  I'm 6'4".  6'4"?  Yeah, that looks about right.  I like Will.  He's got a very serious look to him.  Will's a little wider.  Yeah.  See if we get to stare down.  Will, what's your deal?  I'm, like, well-rounded all over the place.  Yeah, yeah.  You're, like, all proportion big guy.  I'm the versatile kind of way.  Hold on, hold on.  Let's see if we can get the Rocky-style stare down.  Let's just go for it.  Oh, yeah.  There's a stare down going on. 
[01:33:30]  Belly to belly.  Have you done any competitive eating?  Well.  Belly to belly.  Yeah, I've been to two competitions.  You have?  Yeah.  Did you do well?  Wings and pizza, which I both won.  You both won.  You won.  How many people were in those competitions?  The wings was, like, 20 people, and the pizza was, like, five.  Wow.  What's your ring record, buddy?  I did 40 wings in 10 minutes.  Oh, yeah.  And a pie and a slice in 12 minutes. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, good.  An entire pie and a slice in 12 minutes.  Wow.  The chicken wings?  Yeah.  What's your ring record?  My ring record is 137 wings in 12 minutes.  Wow.  I'm from Buffalo.  The current Buffalo wing champ of the world.  Wow.  So, you know, we'll talk after the show.  I'll give you two tips.  You know, that's good, though.  I knew he was going to smash his record because he goes, what's your record?  He goes, 40.  He goes, oh.  It's the way you talk to, like, an eight-year-old who brings you a picture.  Yeah.  It's cute.  You are the champion as far as chicken wings go. 
[01:34:30]  And Buffalo.  And Buffalo.  He's the reigning champion.  Yeah, the reigning Buffalo wing champ.  God damn.  You fly all over the country and the world?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, I fly all over and, you know, do, you know, various contests, you know, through the IFOC.  And actually, there's a contest tomorrow down in Atlantic City.  It's a big meatball contest.  Yeah.  You know, me, several other eaters, we're going down there to just try to eat as much carmine's meatballs as we can.  Wow.  All right.  And Pat, his only victory is this show last year, the eggnog drinking competition. 
[01:35:00]  Pat, I did win the qualifier for Nathan's.  You did good at Salty Balls, though.  Yes.  You did pretty good at Salty Balls, yeah.  Yeah, he came in second in the Salty Balls eating contest.  No, no, no.  I wasn't second.  I was...  Weren't you?  Fourth or fifth.  No, no.  He was like, what was he like, fourth or something like that?  He was fourth.  Yeah, something like that.  Badlands is going to smash everyone.  Oh, I know.  He's too nice.  I'm just seeing Badlands. 
[01:35:30]  He's completely confident.  No, you did good.  Remember, that was really cute what you did.  This is a stopover for him on his way to the friggin' Atlantic City thing.  This is like Michael Jordan talking to a high school basketball fan.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I think you got some skills.  You got a little lust.  That's what he would say.  You got a nice jump shot.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  All right, you guys ready to play?  Yeah.  Bam.  Nah, I'm pretty unassuming, you know what I'm saying?  You know, it's like anything can happen in the world compared to eating, so you know.  You don't know how your sister's going to take to an eggnog. 
[01:36:00]  It might be a weird thing to have that much guys.  Any food ever give you a problem?  Mike, tell me.  Yeah, well, no.  Well, I'm kind of lactose intolerant, but you know, I can handle it, though.  I won't tolerate lactose intolerant.  That's right.  That's right.  I'm going to talk a little trash right now.  That's right.  What's that?  I'm going to talk a little trash.  Oh, yes.  All right.  Get that mic.  Talk some trash.  Will?  I won.  You've already declared yourself the winner.  I won.  Wow.  Why do you think that?  Why strike confident?  Back to the future.  Why, Will?  Just confident. 
[01:36:30]  Who are you representing today?  Where are you from?  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  Parrish Island.  Brooklyn's very cocky.  Guys, let's go to O-Town.  Bring it on, brother.  Oh, it's O-Town.  Sean, what's up?  Brooklyn is hitting today.  Uh-oh.  I've got to come hungry and focused.  Sean, that was your cue.  Let's go.  All right.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hi, Sean.  Hey, Pat.  This is your house, baby.  Don't let...  They're coming to you.  They're coming to you.  You're the champ.  This is your goddamn...  Your house.  Let's talk to you.  All right.  Your house.  Your house. 
[01:37:00]  That's right.  I like Eric a lot, but we've got to root for our boy, Pat.  We have to.  We have to.  All right.  Anyone else out there want to talk?  Anyone else have anything they want to say before we start this contest?  Bring in some of the other guys.  Oh, look at some of the people are really mean.  Pat is going to go down like the Edmund Fitzgerald, only heavier.  Wow.  Guys, we've got Will...  In less time.  Guys, we've got an XM employee on the phone, Will, the sales guy. 
[01:37:30]  Will.  Yo, what's up, boys?  What's up, bro?  I am pulling for Pat all the way, but I've got to tell you, I saw Eric Badlands Booker  in action at Wing Ball.  Yeah.  This guy is a motherfucking machine.  You've been at Wing Ball?  Yeah, I've been at Wing Ball several times.  I'm entering it this year.  Not only is this guy's appetite for food incredible, we went to some titty bar afterwards that this  guy was in.  He was going through strippers and couch dances like you've never seen.  That's right, man.  That's right, man.  Philly is the town, man.  It's too bad I can't be in it this year. 
[01:38:00]  They've got some dumb rule where if you're in compete...  Only first-timers.  Only first-timers.  Are you shitting?  Yeah, they call the Virgin Wing Ball, and it's like up to Wing Ball 14 already.  How can I be a Virgin?  That stinks.  I went to a Wing Ball.  That is an unbelievable event.  Man, man.  They sell out that arena down there.  They change the name of it every other month.  What's it called now?  I have to qualify for it.  The Coyote Center.  Oh, yeah.  It's an unbelievable event.  I've got to give those guys props to the star of that years ago.  Do you guys have groupies, competitive eating groupies?  Because every group has chicks that just want to fuck them. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, yeah, man.  Do good like you wouldn't believe.  I had to tell you.  I guess they don't make it out of the top ten because I haven't found one yet.  A couple of people are checking in on instant feedback.  They want to know if Badlands has a MySpace so they can switch from Pat's to his.  Oh, yes.  That hurts, sir.  No, no.  You know, Pat's still the man, but I do have a MySpace.  Yes.  You do?  Yes.  You know, y'all can log on.  Don't worry.  I'm going home tonight and update it.  Well, I'll do it from the Blackberry right now waiting for the contest.  Is it Badlands? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, Badlands Booker.  Badlands Booker.  All right.  Let's say hi to Doug Outdug.  I'm going to make you my pal.  Doug, what's up?  Appreciate that.  Yeah, I'm in your corner.  I'm on your side.  If you feel yourself going down, hit one of these guys with a chair.  The title cannot change hands on a small screen.  Not with a chair.  It's like wrestling.  Yeah, we got some wrestling rules.  Throw some sand in his eyes.  Break out the ladders.  Yeah, I forgot.  We're getting the rest from the WWE.  Doug hung up.  I want him to repeat the mantra for everyone today.  Oh, well.  All right.  Tony, what are you about?  I'm just here to challenge Pat, take him on. 
[01:39:30]  I think I'm going to give him a good shot.  Plus, I've seen him drinking, like, castor oil and eating raw eggs out there.  I think he's going to get a little revenge on everybody, like Lard S.  Throw up all over everybody.  Were you drinking castor oil?  No, I think that was a joke.  You never know.  Stand by me, reference.  Give me the car crash.  Five minutes in.  Come on.  You guys stand by me.  Anthony, come on.  You got me.  I'm sorry.  Eric, that car crash, you'll hear that several times today.  I'm from central Jersey, Hillsboro.  A lot of local guys. 
[01:40:00]  Jersey.  What happened to the truckers that were going to, like, drive all night to do this?  Oh, they're not.  I was waiting for, like, the 750-pound truckers.  Yeah, what happened to that guy?  Yeah, maybe he couldn't make it.  Bang it.  Oh, wow.  Easy to talk smack when the guy isn't here.  That's correct.  I was looking for old Pat's gifts, too.  I was a little worried.  I didn't see any gifts from Pat.  What?  I was going to bring you a toe ring, but I didn't want to see you put on when it threw up  before I started drinking eggnog.  Maybe I can wear it around my neck.  All right.  Anyone else out there want to talk? 
[01:40:30]  Because we want to get this thing rolling at 9.  Good luck, brother.  Good luck.  Look at Eric.  He's just like, I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.  Look at this.  Who else do we got?  He's beating him.  I didn't eat for three days, and I'm like, it doesn't even matter.  I didn't even know why.  Is that the right strategy, though, to not eat for three days, or does your stomach shrink?  Well, it really depends on the individual, but yes, stomach does shrink if you don't eat.  But, you know, the worst thing you do with my pain is fast.  Yeah.  You know, basically, you know, I train up until, you know, the night before.  I have a nice little dinner, and then, you know, no breakfast in the morning. 
[01:41:00]  Just come hungry and focused and ready to just chow down.  Hungry and focused.  Jeez.  Nice.  What are you laughing at, Tony?  His shirt says, hungry and focused, 6XL.  He's all ready to go.  That's awesome.  That's right.  I'm back in the fresh with my 6XYT, you know.  All right.  There's a guy out there.  Why are you taping me?  You get that fucking camera out of my face.  There's a guy out there that brought Pat a gift.  We asked the people that were showing up at the station today to bring Pat a gift. 
[01:41:30]  I know you.  It's an older gentleman.  I did this one last year.  Oh, you were in a contest last year?  Yeah.  Are you doing it this year again?  Hell no.  I remember, yeah.  Didn't you turn, like, really red?  Yeah, I was pretty much standing right here.  You were sweating.  Yeah, first 15, they were like, oh, Joe's doing well.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember this guy.  You were out at 22?  I was out at 22 or 23.  Pat did 70 and never puked on his own.  Well, he had a...  I didn't even get a chance to puke.  I tried and tried, so I had, like, the sugar shake.  I feel like an epileptic.  He was shaking and he was all red and sweating. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, not a good thing.  It's not a good thing.  He's doing a beavis.  I did.  Someone said, you know, he's supposed to bring Pat something, you know, because...  Yeah.  So I got to a car.  Was that a parking ticket?  No, it's a car.  Yeah, it's a parking ticket.  That's funny visual there, Pat.  It's an orange envelope.  He puts it in front of the video camera, of course.  Yeah, open it up.  Yeah, because it was supposed to be, you know, a little Christmas for Pat.  Your first holiday gift.  He's got a tragic story of no family and a father that abandoned him.  There you go.  He lives in Jersey somewhere. 
[01:42:30]  What is it?  Oh, have a toerrific time.  Stinky feet candy.  Uh, hmm, er, at camp.  I have no clue what the punchline means.  Your pal Joe.  Oh, thank you.  It's a little inspirational card.  Yeah, I found it at one of those sugary candy stores.  And stinky feet to candy.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Well, that's stupid.  I'm not going to spend a lot of money on the guy, you know?  I like how you X'd out one of the toes.  Yeah, why is there five toes on those candies? 
[01:43:00]  All right, who else wants on?  All right, boys.  Thank you, guys.  Yeah, who else is in this?  I got it.  Wow, there are big guys this time around.  Holy shit.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  How big are you, man?  Big guys.  Chris, how much are you?  You're a big guy.  What's up, guys?  Yeah, wait, at least 210.  Times about three.  His stump was at least 210.  Yeah, just under 400, right, Chris?  Yeah, like 390, 395.  Where are you from?  I'm from Delaware.  I'm a paramedic in Delaware.  Nice.  All right, we got somebody representing Delaware today. 
[01:43:30]  All right.  You know, I'm noticing bigger guys this time around.  Pat was really the biggest guy last time, and now you're...  I'm below average.  You're the smallest guy so far in this competition.  We had a bunch of skinny fucks in here last time that were puking after 12 shots, and now  the whole place is full of big guys.  Anything to say, Chris, before the contest?  Regardless of how many shots I'm going to do, I'm going to put on a puking exhibition.  So, you know, it's going to be...  I like this guy.  You know, like I said, my friends all say I sound like a dying rhinoceros when I puke. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, I remember talking to you on the phone.  Yeah.  Okay.  Maybe just spin around while you're puking.  Yeah.  Spread the love.  It's horrible.  Hey, we got...  Ow!  We got the guy that came in second last year, John from Connecticut.  John.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  All right.  I just wanted to wish Pat.  I hope he loses.  He beat me last year, that big 350-pound fucking mutant.  I want to see him go down this year to Booker.  All right.  And how many shots did he do last year?  I puked at 36.  Faggot.  He did...  Second place. 
[01:44:30]  I won at 35.  How did you do at 36?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe it was there.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Wait.  You won the contest at 35 and then just did 35 for us?  Yeah, remember, let's see the fact I puked.  I didn't realize it was 35 extra shots.  I thought...  Oh, wow.  He doubled me.  Oh, this contest is so much better this year.  Thanks, John.  Yeah, I do, man.  And Kev Slider from Whack Bag.  Kev Slider.  Hey, yeah, this is Kev Slider.  I was all for Pat, but when I learned about Badlands being a brother, man, I had to go 
[01:45:00]  with him because, you know, he's my peoples.  He's my peoples, you know?  You peeps got to stick together.  I can dig it, homie.  Rip his hand.  Rip his hand.  Rip his hand.  Where are you from, all right?  I'm from Indiana, man.  All right.  All right.  That's what's up, man.  Good luck, Badlands.  Sorry, Pat, man.  I met you at the Halloween party, but I got to go for Badlands.  Stay hungry and focused, bro.  All right?  Kev, fuck you very much.  You're trying to come off as being a brother with a black man, right?  Yeah, that's right.  This guy is such an Oreo, by the way. 
[01:45:30]  What?  I just wanted to tell you.  You were on Paw Talk last night.  He's outraged.  Kev Slider.  All right.  It's the new treat.  It's called the chocolate-covered cracker.  Let's say how to Harvey in New York.  Harvey!  Nothing?  No, it's true.  It's pretty good.  Sounds yummy, actually.  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Pat told me he's saving it for the big one.  Pat can't lose.  He's blessed.  I think I don't know what you're doing, Pat. 
[01:46:00]  Drink some nog at six o'clock.  Get a club.  Six o'clock.  Drink some nog.  It's fucking Jake.  He's blessed.  That's very good.  I'm going to be drinking more eggnog this time.  Thank you, Mr. Keitel.  Hey, it's good.  I remember Dice from last year, too.  You were in the contest, right?  Yep.  Third place last year.  Third.  Yeah.  What did you do last year?  How many?  27.  27.  Yeah, we didn't have much confidence in you from the start, but you really surprised everybody. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, I can't blame you.  I don't know why I remember.  Because I used to look like him, sound a lot like him, you know.  You could kind of see it.  Yeah, definitely.  Like back in the day.  Yeah, if you...  The younger Dice.  The slick back hair and everything.  Yeah.  It's all there.  All right.  300 bucks in a ride.  I could go for that.  What's in the bowl, bitch?  All right.  And, uh, Sean?  Oh, what's up, Sean?  I'm sorry.  How y'all done?  I didn't see you there.  What were you thinking?  You were behind Eric. 
[01:47:00]  I didn't see that.  I know.  I'm the smallest right now, so.  Yeah.  Yeah, Sean, I think I could.  Yeah, 170.  How many shots do you think you could do?  Double shots.  Double shots.  I already broke one glass.  Uh, let's see.  Probably 25.  And where are you from?  Jersey.  Jersey.  Okay.  All right.  Jersey represent?  I think we've got to take a break, because I think it's time for game on.  We'll take a break, get everybody in their positions.  Yeah, we'll meet the rest of the guys that haven't talked yet.  Get the eggnog in here and start this thing.  Basically, it's really, really simple. 
[01:47:30]  These guys will do a double shot of eggnog every minute until they puke.  Last guy standing will win the eggnog drinking contest.  So they puke or tap out.  Yeah.  Pat did 70 double shots and stopped at that point last year, and then threw two fingers  in his good old mouth to puke.  Mm-hmm.  Let's see what happens this year.  I want to make sure Steve is safe this hunting season. 
[01:48:00]  Oh.  I kind of hoped I could get out of the studio before this second story.  Has there, uh...  Well...  Has there been a problem?  Well, they've got a bear problem in New Jersey, and Steve happens to live in New Jersey.  Where do you live first?  Oh, Jersey.  I live in Jersey.  That's right.  It's in Jersey.  Every once in a while, uh, they allow the hunters to just start, uh, shooting bears  in the fine state of New Jersey.  Doesn't matter where that bear may be.  It could be in your backyard.  They don't give a fuck.  As long as they thin the herd a little bit, you're right, Phil.  They want to take about 400 bears out, I think.  Something like that.  And the animal rights people come up, and they get all pissed off. 
[01:48:30]  They just don't want people killing the bears.  Uh, and then the hunters want to hunt bears because it's fun for them.  And then the people that, uh, live in areas that have bears want them hunted because you  don't want, uh, your little puggle to get eaten.  Of course, at night, when you put the little cute guy out back, like a boxer.  Yeah.  Do we have audio of, uh, the hunters going out and shooting at the bears?  Oh, no, I don't want to hear that.  Oh!  This is audio of the bear hunt?  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  This is audio of the bear hunt. 
[01:49:30]  You can't take that, punter.  Oh, foul.  What's Poe doing there?  Oh, and I call you rock!  Ah! 
[01:50:00]  This is the ONA virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:50:30]  Tell your friend about the program if you're enjoying what you're hearing.  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  We have a bunch of math geniuses trying to figure out how much eggnog we need.  Well...  And that's good to do as we're starting the contest.  I know, we're getting a little nervous because, uh, we're starting to take a look at these  guys in the contest, and, uh, we're starting to think that we don't have enough eggnog.  Uh, we're thinking it's going to come down to Pat from Menachie and Eric, uh, Badlands,  uh, Booker. 
[01:51:00]  Booker, yeah.  The lactose may give, uh, Badlands a problem.  You never know.  May give him a problem.  Eric is four hundred and, uh, what, fifty pounds?  Four hundred and twenty pounds.  Yeah, yeah.  Look how small the entire bottle of eggnog looks next to him, though.  That looks like he could just...  Man, this is a glass.  Look at him.  He's holding it up.  It just looks like a glass.  Oh, God.  That's like any other person.  That would just be one glass.  Yeah.  All right.  So we think it's going to be down to these two, but we have another thirteen competitors.  I don't even think we could get everyone in the studio. 
[01:51:30]  Which is a shame that they haven't taken care of our space here in New York, because this  would have been perfect to, uh, take outside the studio, but instead we've got cubicles  with guys, uh, doing what?  I don't know.  Maybe if I have to puke on the cubicles.  This would have been a perfect thing to take outside the studio.  Perfect.  But we'll have to make it, uh, work, so.  I think we're ready for the contest.  Let's shove in as many people as we can get in.  I don't know how this is going to work, but, uh.  Three.  All right.  A couple behind that, maybe?  No.  Maybe we could puke on the, uh, cubicles. 
[01:52:00]  They'll have to get rid of them then.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  There it is.  Another vehicle repair bill.  Meh.  All right.  Let's get, uh, let's get the guys in.  Who's going to be doing the pouring and all that?  I guess, uh, I will.  Where's Bill?  Did Bill make it in today?  Bill's not here yet.  Bill's not here.  All right.  We're going to have to get Ben or Ray or somebody.  What happened to Bill?  Because, uh, we've got to be very organized for this contest, because here's the deal.  If you're just tuning in for the first time, basically we've got, uh, I think 15 guys. 
[01:52:30]  They're all going to do a double shot of eggnog every minute until they puke.  They puke, they're out of the contest.  Simple as that, okay?  Simple as that.  I don't even know what the prize is.  I don't even know if these guys care.  No.  I think they just want to win the contest, because they see what it did for, uh, for Pat  last year.  Made him a star.  Pat became a star because of this, uh, very bit.  Wow, look at all these guys.  Oh my God, there's no way everyone's going to fit.  Look at the size of all of them.  Anyone else have anything to say before the contest? 
[01:53:00]  We haven't talked to James.  Did you just get out of prison?  Wait, the mic's not on, Eric.  It's on!  What's up, Opie?  It wasn't on, though, Eric.  Now it's on.  What's going on?  You got anything to say before the contest?  Nope.  No?  Nothing.  Just focused.  Ready?  They're all focused, okay.  Staying focused.  Hope you don't get a myocardial infarction.  We can move that light out of the way. 
[01:53:30]  Just bust an accent.  Wow.  Pull a bust an accent.  Pat, you can move over a little bit there, I think.  Goofing on people.  We're trying to get everyone in the room, Anthony.  That's the delight.  Yeah, that's tough.  It's a herd.  This is a lot of fucking people.  This is a herd.  Anyone else have anything they want to say before the contest?  We were trying to interview most of you guys.  Dice?  Yeah, I just wanted to plug JesusPants.com.  JesusPants.com.  What could that possibly be?  Website of all different, like, you know, obscene t-shirts and clothes and pants and all 
[01:54:00]  shit like that.  Oh, I gotcha.  Jesus Pants, what's he been running?  Oh, my God.  What is that?  That is so bad.  That was so bad.  All right.  We got everybody in?  All right.  By the way, during commercial breaks, hoping, I will be taking pictures with my camera  phone and directly uploading pictures as they are happening to my MySpace site. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, my God.  So if you sign up as a friend of mine, you'll be able to see these pictures, not on Jimmy's  site, but only on Anthony's site.  I can't, I can't, I don't make the money to afford that kind of fancy camera, so.  Whatever, whatever it takes.  I want pals.  You want to go?  This is our last day with Jimmy for a couple of weeks, so I'm sorry, Jimmy, but by Monday,  I'm going to blow him away.  By Monday, Anthony's just going to have more friends.  He's hoarding friends, though.  I know he's got about 600 in the till, and I've been keeping people pretty steadily coming  on, so I got a little over 4,000 friends. 
[01:55:00]  MySpace crashes, though.  I can't do anything about that.  He was crashing last night.  That's because of all of my friends.  Okay.  Cheater.  Are we organized behind the scenes here?  Mm-hmm.  Don't we got, we want these guys to have their cups on the table so we could, so we could  fill them up as we go?  Oh, there was another picture.  All right.  All right, let's get the first double shot.  The cure for AIDS, MySpace slash Anthony Comia. 
[01:55:30]  Sucker.  Cocksucker.  MySpace, Jim Norton.  All right.  Wow.  All right, we're filling up the glasses, Anthony.  There they go.  Everybody getting their glass right up to the line.  This, you know what else is going to be a problem?  We didn't encounter this last time because there weren't this many.  Competitors getting all the glasses full in the minute between rounds.  Right.  How many guys are going to be pouring? 
[01:56:00]  Well, see, we should have thought ahead of time.  We should have.  Three guys.  We should have had a lot of glasses on the table.  How long is this going to take for you guys to pour all these out?  Well.  They're going to have to.  Now, think.  It's not just them pouring.  These guys got to drink it.  Right.  Then they got to put it down and get it refilled before the minute's over.  And get the right cup to the right person.  And get the cup to the right person.  We need more pourers.  Maybe the pourers can walk around from person to person.  Travis, we're going to need your help today.  We need Travis.  Don't worry.  It's not going to.  You think we could pour every minute, 15 shots? 
[01:56:30]  This could be a problem.  Assign guys to each guy.  Assign guys to each guy.  That's not a bad idea.  You want to work for the show?  Jesus.  That's not a bad idea.  All right.  I noticed Paul's here helping.  Well, we got Denise.  That's good.  Thank God we have Paul.  You can get the milk right from the tap.  All right.  That's funny.  Yeah, we got to get one from that.  Pat. 
[01:57:00]  Paul's wife walks in.  He goes, yeah, we can get the milk right from the tap.  Looks like there's plenty of milk for the contest.  We're not going to run out.  We're just going to get a bucket and a stool.  All right.  You got to know you got to.  I don't know.  All right.  You stopped.  Jimmy, there's enough confusion in here without you.  Yeah, let's roll yours in.  All right.  All right.  How many pourers do we have?  Five?  I'm here.  All right.  So you guys know what you're doing?  No pourers.  No. 
[01:57:30]  What a mess.  Eggnog looks unusually pussy today.  Well, it does have that greenish, yellow tinge to it.  Turkey Hill, that's a name, eggnog, though.  We wanted to knock some of the competitors out early, so that's the eggnog that we kept out all night.  Get him out quick.  Yeah, it was just sitting on a radiator.  We don't even have it poured yet?  No.  No.  How are we going to do this every minute?  Yeah. 
[01:58:00]  I see a huge problem here.  Danny's on top of it.  Danny, you feeling good?  Danny.  Yeah, I mean, obviously we're going to need to do this in zones.  So someone needs to be over there.  I think we need another person.  Two people in the middle and one person over here.  I think we'll be all right.  Jimmy's shaking his head with much doubt.  We'll be all right.  You'll see, Jimmy.  All right.  All right, here we go.  It's not a lack of faith in any person, except for Paul.  It's not a lack of faith in any person.  It's a lack of just, it's time.  There are certain things that I believe are impossible, and I think filling this many in a minute 
[01:58:30]  and getting it back to them to take another shot is impossible.  We'll see.  We can do it.  I see we're mixing brands of eggnog.  You have Turkey Hill eggnog and Pathmark eggnog.  Pathmark.  Pat is studying everything in the room.  That's right.  An issue.  Pathmark eggnog, now only 99 cents a gallon at Pathmark.  Remember that guy?  And then he ended up in like Poultergeist fucking everybody over.  What happened there?  He was like the happy Pathmark guy. 
[01:59:00]  Pathmark produce is the best around.  God, and then there's like bodies and skeletons falling into a hole.  All right, Danny is organizing.  I think we're going to do okay here.  We need a few of these guys to bail early.  Wonderful.  That's what it comes down to.  And we have enough eggnog, right?  Eric, you're confident in that?  Yeah.  You're confident.  All right.  We've got a lot of eggnog.  We're good.  How many gallons do we have?  About 30 gallons.  I think we need more than 30 gallons.  Somebody else can I drink?  I'm going to go on record and say that we need more than 30 gallons. 
[01:59:30]  You don't think we're going to have enough?  No.  No.  Hawk, how many do we have poured so far?  Hawk.  We're ready.  How many?  All right.  We're ready?  Thirsty.  All right.  I'm entering.  No, you're not, Jimmy.  All right.  We're going to start the contest in less than a minute.  Anyone have anything they want to say before we start?  Pat, you are the champ.  How does it smell?  I am the champ.  Yes.  You're the reigning champ here.  Police not be daddy.  Oh, because his father abandoned him. 
[02:00:00]  Police not my dad.  I was waiting for you to bring in a homeless guy and say, here's your father.  Sonny boy.  You know what?  I want Pat to win.  Who doesn't?  He's so lovable.  We want Pat to win.  I want Pat to win and then Badlands just to punch him in the face.  Eggnog drinking contest starts in 20 seconds.  These guys will drink a double shot of eggnog every minute until they puke.  And coincidence, another contest, the pouring contest starts a minute later. 
[02:00:30]  And I don't have any faith.  No, come on.  All right.  Here we go.  In five, four, three, two, one.  Let it rip.  There it goes.  The first round.  Everybody very confident.  There's no problem here.  That's just a walk in the park.  There it is.  Now, remember, when your cup is filled, just hold it.  Last year, we had people actually drinking it as they were pouring it out.  Yep.  You know, the presents are nice, but I'm just here for the eggnog. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  We're 25 seconds in.  How many cups are filled?  We're all good.  Is everyone done?  All right.  Wait, guys.  With my doubt, all right, I must say, I definitely underestimated the staff.  Because I took charge.  I didn't leave it up to you.  All right, Danny.  You know what?  I'm with Danny.  That was amazing.  Danny does a good job organizing.  Danny did it in less than 30 seconds.  15 seconds, and you guys will have to take another.  I've got a half one of these cups, and I'm fucking finished. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  You're awful.  This gives you some shit.  Nasty.  Big, thick.  Yuck.  All right.  Here we go.  The second shot.  Here it comes.  Three, two, one.  Shot.  There it is.  There you go.  See, it's easy so far.  Of course.  It's just a half of a regular little cup.  This is a piece of cake.  Maybe the Pathmark stuff is just not as tasty.  Oh, really?  Yes.  All right.  Everyone got their second shot down with no problem, obviously.  Eric Badlands, how are you feeling, buddy?  I'm feeling good.  I'm feeling good.  This is a piece of cake. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, this is just amateur hour for him.  All right.  All right.  Here's going to be a problem with Eric.  Now he's got to get a new...  Oh, wow.  What happened?  Eric got thrown because he had to get a brand new thing of eggnog, and he's knocked something  over.  He's panicked.  Oh, he's panicking already.  Like Ben's cock in a china shop.  Dude, just keep opening eggnog.  All right.  We're getting ready for the third shot, Anthony.  Yes. 
[02:02:30]  Third shot.  I'm not even going to ask if anyone's getting having any problems yet.  No, it's so early.  You shouldn't...  You wouldn't have any business even fucking being here if you were having a problem now.  I think we'll...  Two, one, shot.  Here goes the third shot.  Drinking him down.  Third double shot of eggnog.  Badlands, you don't even see him do the shot.  It goes so fast.  All right.  Yeah, Pat takes a little more time than Badlands.  Badlands, though, wham, it's down.  A couple of the other guys I'm noticing, they're drinking like...  It's sipping whiskey. 
[02:03:00]  Right.  It's taking a little more time.  I don't think they're full or anything.  I just don't think they're professional enough to understand how it's...  Anyone have anything they want to say so far?  Anything.  I'm just trying to...  Eatabullet.com.  Huh?  Thank you.  Eatabullet.com.  Eatabullet.com.  The path mark's a lot better than Turkey Hill.  Oh, really?  A lot better.  I don't know who would have said that.  Who would have thought that?  I come from a low-class family, you know?  Yeah, you like...  Turkey Hill, way too expensive.  You like just the store brand shit?  Yep.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  All right, starting to catch up on us. 
[02:03:30]  We're getting ready for the fourth shot.  Mm-hmm.  The fourth double shot of eggnog.  And we're going to do that in five seconds here.  Five already?  There we go.  Here we go.  Three, two, one, and here goes the fourth shot.  Fourth shot.  All right, as I look around the room, who's got the biggest problem there?  Anyone having a problem whatsoever?  Dice is very slow in the back.  Very slow.  Taking my time with you.  Just taking your time.  All right.  Everyone getting the refill? 
[02:04:00]  So far, the guys have done four double shots of eggnog.  We're filling up for five.  Actually, you did a good job there, Denise.  Denise is helping us with the pouring of the eggnog.  She's shaking.  Why are you shaking, Denise?  I don't know.  Very nerve-wracking.  I don't know.  It's very nerve-wracking to get them all filled up in time for the next shot.  Cute thong.  All right.  Anyone having a problem whatsoever?  Feeling anything?  Nothing, right?  I got a problem with it.  When people start puking, there's like a trash can in here.  This place is too packed.  Oh, don't worry.  You'll see people start getting away from the garbage pail. 
[02:04:30]  You better watch out.  Plastic down.  Yeah, you guys are going to have to work together.  So here we go.  The fifth shot of eggnog.  One shot.  There you go.  Wow.  No problem for anyone.  We're five shots into the eggnog drinking contest.  Oh, boy.  That's actually ten eggnog shots.  Yeah, it's double shots.  Let's not forget.  We're up to ten ounces.  Yes, get that Badlands CD, Hungry and Focus 2, IFOC.com. 
[02:05:00]  He's got time to plug.  Life doesn't matter to him.  Pat, he's plugging.  The current champ.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Monclerbikery.com.  I credit them for this physique.  All right.  How many gallons of eggnog have we gone through?  About?  I'm just making sure we have enough.  Should we go for a run already?  Really?  Already? 
[02:05:30]  I think I sent them or Ben sent them.  All right.  Yeah.  We want to be on the safe side.  Okay.  Getting ready for the sixth double shot of eggnog, Anthony.  And go.  Damn, Will.  No problem over there, right, Will?  Will tossing it right back.  I see that.  Sean.  I see it in his eyes.  I'm weak.  I'm weak.  You're not weak.  Already he's the first one.  Skinny guy.  Go figure.  He's the guy that weighs 170 pounds. 
[02:06:00]  You're not weak.  No, I woke up and I ate chicken select.  With sweet and sour sauce.  Everyone, no cheating.  No cheating.  Hey, hey, hey.  No cheating.  Hey, hey.  Hey, what's good, Pat?  What's good, Pat?  You paid your man off to get me over the line, man.  Uh-oh.  Yo, yo, what's good, man?  What's good with that?  Everybody's got, right?  All right.  Everyone's got.  Okay.  All right.  I think it's going to start getting interesting in the next couple minutes.  Yeah.  So, we're getting ready for the seventh double shot. 
[02:06:30]  Seven already?  Wow.  See, it goes fast.  Yeah.  It goes fast.  I'm going to keep my eye on Sean now that I know he's the weak link here.  He's got his eyes.  His eyes are watering slightly.  Here we go, guys.  Go.  Seventh double shot of eggnog.  This looks like what came out of me when I had a prostate infection.  Thank you.  Oh.  That's helping.  That's helping.  Thank you for the visual.  All right.  Sean's still in there, right?  He's in there.  Pretty soon he's going to be Sean of the Black.  I see Dice taking his time to the back.  Yeah.  Dice doing his normal strategy, taking his time.  Anyone? 
[02:07:00]  Right here.  I said Pat from Monaki is...  He's what?  He's going to hold the line.  Come on, Sean.  You can do it.  Hey, these lines are disappearing.  Pretend it's Jägermeister, man.  Pretend it's Jägermeister.  He's got the hat on.  Pretend it's Jägermeister.  He's got the hat on.  We should bring Tibby Tom in here to make the smell a little worse.  Oh, you know what?  That's not a bad point, Opie.  Not a bad point.  Have him dance on the stage.  On the stage.  No, I don't want him near me.  I'm going to take him now.  As it gets down, I think the time...  We might have to.  I don't want him near me.  No.  All right.  We're getting ready for the eighth double shot of eggnog. 
[02:07:30]  Getting ready, guys.  Up to the lips.  And...  Go.  Go.  Oh, Sean's taking a little longer now.  All eyes are on Sean and Dice in the background.  How are you doing, man?  Great, thanks.  I think we should bring Dice to the front.  Dude, I'm watching.  I don't see the...  He was third. 
[02:08:00]  He did a little bit of a...  Oh, that's right.  He did come in third.  All right, you can stay there.  You're right.  You're right.  When you're right, you're right.  Anyone have anything they want to say or plug?  We've got, like, a few seconds here.  Step up to the balance.  And IFOCE.com for all your competitive eating news and information.  You want to keep on a great contest.  Me and Pat from Nakagosu, IFOCE.com.  All right.  Wow.  All right.  He's good.  Anthony, we're getting ready for the ninth double shot.  Coming up.  Coming up.  Of eggnog.  It's coming up.  Hopefully not.  It's coming up. 
[02:08:30]  You may?  Oh, good.  I got eggnog to look at in these knockers right there.  I just saw all I got.  With that, guys, it's time for the ninth double shot.  Hit it.  Yeah.  Paul's wife.  Damn, Will is still slamming it back.  It's a big hit.  Huh?  I got more.  And Ben just came back with more eggnog, just in case.  Thank goodness.  How about more gallons?  All right, Will.  Down.  Oh, you got that good eggnog.  Oh, yeah.  What's the good eggnog?  Yeah, third brand. 
[02:09:00]  You guys get the nice stuff for later on in the contest.  All right, Anthony, nine done.  This will be the tenth shot.  Anyone getting close to puking?  Anybody?  Be honest.  Or even feeling like...  They keep pointing at dice.  He actually came in third last year, so he's going to hang in there for a while.  All right, I'm going to give you credit now.  He was setting double shots last year, and now at nine, the mic's in front of me.  How are you feeling, Sean?  I'm feeling good.  Oh, God.  A lot of burping now going on.  Ten shots.  I'm feeling one-seventh full. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  A little trash talking in the middle of the contest.  What about Badlands?  I'm all right.  All right, here we go.  Not even an issue, right?  Guys, ready?  Tenth double shot of eggnog.  There it goes.  Not even an issue.  They're up to 20 ounces, Anthony.  20 ounces of eggnog.  All right.  What about you, Lane?  Huh?  What's that, sir?  First time you're drinking it?  Good stuff or what?  Yeah, it's good stuff.  All right.  Tony has no problem so far. 
[02:10:00]  It's very heavy.  Where'd you grow up that you never had eggnog?  Hey, hey.  You never drank eggnog before?  Tony, you can pour a little of that out.  There's a bad pour there.  Yeah, I've noticed a few bad pours.  One more bad pourhawk and you're fired.  You're out.  All right, there you go.  He's knocking stuff over, overpouring.  Get him out of there.  All right, we're getting ready for the 11th shot.  I beg not.  Sean?  Are you out, Sean?  Uh-oh.  I'm coming close.  I'm coming close.  He's coming close. 
[02:10:30]  Keep going.  All right, we have 15 competitors ready.  Here we go.  The 11th double shot of eggnog.  Go.  Deep breath.  Sean, deep breath.  Anissa's helping out Sean.  I have a shot.  Come on, Sean.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Sean's hanging in there.  He's got to know he's not even going to win the competition, but he's hanging in there.  He might.  You never know, but he might just puke.  Who's the Santa guy? 
[02:11:00]  It's frigging Sonny.  Sonny Farrell.  Anyone else need?  There they go, filling up.  All right.  Badlands, how is it?  Just nothing?  Oh, man.  I'm just getting whomped up.  That's nothing for him so far.  Oh, man.  This is going to be ugly.  That's nothing.  Oh, man.  How about Will?  Will, you doing all right?  Yeah, that side of the room?  All right?  He's got his poker face working.  Yeah, definitely.  A couple of the skinny guys in the back over there.  That could be a problem. 
[02:11:30]  Will was eating before we came in.  I'm good.  Really?  He was eating a bagel before we stepped in.  I actually had a bagel and a half.  You know how much room?  Oh, a bagel and a half.  How much eggnog that takes up?  Exactly.  With that said, hit the 12th shot.  12th shot.  12th double shot of eggnog is going down.  All right.  I got time, right?  Huh?  As long as I do it before the next one?  I'll see.  It has begun.  It's started.  It has begun.  The slowing down process has begun.  Now, Sean still has his 12th shot of eggnog in his hand. 
[02:12:00]  All eyes are on Sean.  You can tell when they're full.  Their voice sounds different.  It's more bassy.  They've got that bubble in their frog sound.  Is it okay or why?  I'm coming to the stage.  Will Sean be moving on in the contest here, Sean?  You've got like 20 seconds to get that done.  I am Sean, and I am drinking eggnog on the radio.  All right.  We'll see.  And all right.  He did it.  All right.  He did it.  He's still in the contest. 
[02:12:30]  He's done with 15 seconds left to fill his cup, recover, and do the next one.  And the next one is about to begin.  Sean is starting to catch up with you.  There it is.  And go.  Oh, wow.  It seems like you just did one, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Like 15 seconds ago.  Just take a half a sip.  A little sip.  He'd be fine.  No, he can't even think of taking a sip yet.  Anyone else having problems?  Raise your hand, because we'd like to talk to you.  Who are you?  Jay.  Jay's having a problem.  Jay.  I'm feeling it now.  You're feeling it, but you got the 13th shot down. 
[02:13:00]  Uh-oh.  Sean?  Wait.  Sean?  I'm about to shit my pants.  Are you tapping?  Are you going to tap out?  The Imodium's out there in my backpacks.  Shit your pants already.  Do something for the radio show.  Oh, shit.  How great would that be?  No vomiting.  Sean, you got 25 seconds or you're out of the competition.  Sean, just look around.  Look at all the fatties around you.  There's no way.  Yeah, right?  All these fatties, I'm out.  I'm done.  I'm out.  All right.  Thank you.  That's it.  Sean is out.  Sean.  Sean is out.  Done.  We got 14 competitors to go. 
[02:13:30]  More eggnog for me.  All right, Sean.  Good job there, buddy.  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right.  There he goes.  We're getting ready for the 14th double shot of eggnog.  And go.  Doesn't make much more room here in the studio with him leaving.  And by the way, anyone starting to have a problem, I want you to move forward so we can...  Yeah, we have a problem.  Tim.  Tim.  You having a problem there?  I was out drinking until 2 in the morning.  I'm not feeling too good.  Oh.  I'm having a problem. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah?  I have to wait a whole minute before I can have another eggnog.  Oh.  That's from a knock.  She rash.  Anyone else?  She rash.  But Tim from Jersey, he weighs 335 pounds.  He was drinking all night.  He's starting to have a problem.  Yeah, big guy.  He might be the next guy out here.  I didn't know I was coming here.  Oh, really?  You got dragged here by a friend or something?  Yeah, Sean.  Sean brought you by.  Okay.  I think we're getting very close to the 15th double shot of eggnog. 
[02:14:30]  Everyone filled up and ready to go?  I must say the pouring thing is going very well.  Very smoothly.  Very well.  And here we go.  15.  Bam.  Most of the guys slamming him back, Anthony.  Tim's shaking.  Look at his shaky hand as he's just sipping it.  His cheeks are shaking.  He drank half of it.  He drank half of it with a very shaky hand.  Boy, he's going to have some trouble.  Get a shake that one up. 
[02:15:00]  Will, hold up.  Oh, it was a little sour.  At least Sean won't have to wait long for you so that you could leave together.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, yeah.  But he got it down, Anthony.  Everybody got it?  Yep.  All right, we have 15 shots complete.  That's 30 ounces of eggnog.  Are you fat?  Tim got that down?  Oh, okay.  He's like aiming.  I thought they were refilling a cup that was half full.  Anyone else having a problem?  A question and against anyone else having a problem?  Just got to burp. 
[02:15:30]  Just got to burp and make some more room, right?  Yeah, that's what happens.  Obviously, the longer we go on, the harder it gets for these people.  You can see it on their faces.  Go.  Already another one, gentlemen.  See how this works.  It just starts catching up with you.  There you go.  Will, you're putting his cup out there like, hey, Philip.  Take it like a man.  Will, any problems?  No.  Tim, what's the matter?  Halfway there.  To vomiting.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I hear him kind of. 
[02:16:00]  Let's go.  You're kind of breathing heavy and gagging a little?  It's not going too well.  No, you're feeling a little nausea.  Come on, Tim.  Hungry and focus, man.  You can do it.  A little nauseous, a little queasy stomach.  A little morning sickness.  A little sour stomach.  Huh?  Oh, no, no.  Oh, wait.  You haven't finished yours yet?  No, that's my next one.  That's my next one.  Oh, that'll be...  No, I need to know what number this next round is.  I think it's going to be 17.  Uh-oh.  Tim, come on, Will.  Time for jumping jacks.  Tim, they're getting the mics ready. 
[02:16:30]  Tim.  You're fine, Tim.  Tim's like rubbing his eyes.  He's turning a little red.  He's shaking like crazy.  There it is.  Suck it down.  He did it.  Quick, fill it.  Refill it.  Refill it.  All right, here we go.  Suck down that thick liquid.  With that said, we're up to the 17th.  Yeah.  She's double shot of eggnog.  Let her rip.  Just sip it, Tim.  You get a whole minute.  You're fine.  Tim got the last one in just under the wire.  Just under the wire.  He had to drink it down and then instantly refill the cup and instantly start. 
[02:17:00]  Uh-oh.  Just stay away from that.  Uh-huh.  Denise is packing.  I just saw.  Oh, oh, there he goes.  Wait a minute.  Mike the Trask.  Oh!  Let's listen in.  Reversal of fortune.  Guys, you guys try not to scream because we've got to hear some of this.  Let's listen in.  Give an empty cotton.  Throw that back out.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  With that, we've got to think about it, Tim. 
[02:17:30]  Goodbye, Tim.  Thanks, Tim.  Goodbye, Tim.  Oh, way to go.  Tim is out from Jersey.  Three hundred and thirty-five pounds.  With that, we've got to go right to the 18th double shot of eggnog.  And there they go.  Oh, wow.  Tim really booed.  Tim really booed.  The other mic, because that's the one I talk into every night.  I'm so happy stupid Patrice is here next week.  He really did booze that up very nicely.  And then there were 13.  He was shaking. 
[02:18:00]  Did you see his hand?  He was having a problem.  Yeah.  Violently shaking.  Anyone else?  I hope we have a pail out there, too, for the...  Yes.  We do?  Good planning.  I hate the fact that Tom and Spoon can't watch this in here.  That's not right.  These guys come in as guests and can't come in.  Well, as soon as we get a little more room, we'll bring them in.  All right.  That's what I think would be fair for everybody.  Good point.  Hey, what's going on over here?  Yeah, I'm full.  You're full?  You're getting full?  That's right.  It kind of seems to be fine.  But you finished the last one?  Yeah, of course.  Okay, so you're going to make it another round.  Absolutely. 
[02:18:30]  Anyone else having a problem?  You?  Jay?  Pretty much.  You might want to start moving toward the garbage can.  All right, here we go, Anthony.  You're having a problem?  Guys, hit it.  Nineteenth, double shot of eggnog.  There they go.  You're doing really good, Wayne.  Who's making that sound?  I'm a nurse.  Pat, anything?  I'm just getting started.  Just getting started?  Just wetting my whistle.  All right.  You like Huey Lewis on the news? 
[02:19:00]  Oh, well.  He's on that expansion.  Oh, Jimmy's trying to do sound effects.  Jesus, Jimmy.  I want my own little team.  He's a little closer to Anthony, so now he's like, I want a machine.  I know you do, Jimmy.  We're thinking about it.  We'll see.  All right, wait, wait.  Who's having a problem?  That way now.  Huh?  Nothing.  Jay, you having a problem?  Yeah, Jay's about ready to go.  All right, maybe Jay should be by the pail.  Come over here.  No, over here.  All right.  Here we go, guys.  Reach from where you stand. 
[02:19:30]  This will be the twentieth double shot of eggnog.  And go.  How's everyone doing?  I can't see everybody.  Danny, everyone doing all right?  Everybody's doing good.  That might have been it.  Jay, you all right?  All right.  Who said that that might be it?  Wayne.  That was me.  Wayne might be out.  Try one more.  Wayne from Brooklyn.  Our 190-pound competitor. 
[02:20:00]  By the way, Anthony, they have done 40 ounces of eggnog so far.  40 ounces.  40 ounces.  All right.  Another 100.  I might start feeling full.  Pat, you think you could do 70 this year again?  I'm going to keel over, though.  I should be able to.  Yes.  All right.  I can keep it down.  It's just the expansion.  The expansion?  The expansion.  Yes, that stomach expansion.  All right.  With that said, we're getting ready for the 21st double shot of eggnog. 
[02:20:30]  I'm waiting for him to go first.  And go.  Go.  This is really bad.  Jay, do it.  Do it.  Bad eggnog.  Yeah, I want to go back to that one.  This is rotten.  Yeah, I got to be out, man.  Wayne's out.  What?  Who's out?  Wayne's out.  He's tapping out.  He's tapping.  He's tapping out.  Tapped out. 
[02:21:00]  Get rid of his cup.  And let's say goodbye to Wayne from Brooklyn, our 190-pound competitor.  All right.  Well.  I'm out this year, too.  Whoa.  Wait.  What a surprise.  Wow.  Dice is bowing out also.  Jesuspants.com.  He came in what last year?  Third.  Third last year.  He is now what place?  I don't know.  It would be like 13th place or 12th place.  Wow.  We're down to 11 competitors. 
[02:21:30]  Some third from the end this year.  Yeah.  Back from the front last year.  All right.  Wow.  Changes the whole complexion of the game here, doesn't it?  We got real competitors this year.  Opie, the skinny guys.  Go, guys.  Go, guys.  Go.  The skinny guys really having a problem this year.  Yes.  This is what it is against these big gentlemen.  No, no, no, no.  Uh-oh.  I'm not going to throw it off.  Spilling it all over, everybody.  A couple more.  Danny.  Jay.  All right.  You're spilling it on people there, Danny?  He's taking requests.  Wait.  Who's the axle road?  Rich is out. 
[02:22:00]  Rich is out.  What?  And Carmine's out.  Oh, my God.  Look at how quickly they're dropping.  All right.  Rich is out from Jersey.  Carmine's out from the Bronx.  We are down to nine competitors.  Nine competitors.  Well, a lot more room in here.  A lot more heaving room.  All right.  Move over.  So far, only one guy has puked.  Yep.  Other guys tapping out.  Tapping out.  Uh-oh.  Jay?  Uh-oh.  I'm just saying I will perform.  I hope someone takes one for the team and perform. 
[02:22:30]  Jay, how are you doing?  How are you feeling?  Just so that you guys know, I will perform for you guys.  Oh, very good.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I'm throwing up at the end as well.  All right.  With that said, we are at 23.  The 23rd double shot of eggnog, I believe.  Unless I've lost track.  I don't know.  There's too much going on here.  I don't know.  I think it's 23.  Jay?  I just swallowed my own puke.  Oh, no.  All right.  Jay has swallowed his own puke, Anthony.  Wow.  All right.  Let's listen in.  All right. 
[02:23:00]  We got to get the audio.  Did everyone get him down?  Everybody can try.  Tony?  No.  You can get this.  All right.  A little banter that's going on.  Oh, how are you doing?  Coughing over there.  Tony?  I'm just trying to stretch.  Tony's trying to stretch his gut.  I saw him coughing.  He's like, hoot, hoot, hoot.  I need some room in here.  A little heave.  All right.  Anyone feeling a little warmer than they were when they first came in?  I got to say hi.  I'm starting to feel it.  Yeah, a little warmer.  Now, I'd like to thank OPNM before this great training session before the meatball contestant 
[02:23:30]  tomorrow.  This is a training session for him.  Oh, shit.  You know.  I don't have to drink my guy on the water tonight.  Unbelievable.  Here we go.  We're up to 24 double-shot eggnog.  Go.  Oh, Jay's already.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  We might want to listen.  Jay, what do you got?  He made it?  Yeah.  He barely made it, Anthony.  He was dry heaving a little bit.  I saw that.  In his cup, he was dry heaving as he was drinking. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  That is just unbelievable.  Jay's finished.  Oh, my God.  He's still going for more.  All right.  And Jay's still in.  Jay's a trooper.  Anybody else getting close?  Anyone getting close?  What's your name, bro?  Chug it.  Garbage dick.  Huh?  Garbage dick.  That's garbage dick.  All right.  Getting close.  You want to promote anything before you start puking?  Myspace.com slash Anthony Coomian.  Oh.  Oh, hey.  There it is.  I like that.  Very nice.  That was hurtful.  Wait, Jay.  That was hurtful.  Shut up. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  Let's not.  Eatabullet.com.  Thanks, Jay.  By the way, guys, if we could not react when these guys puked, that would be really cool.  That's really hard.  I know.  We'll see what happens.  You know why we got such good audio?  Go, go.  And then go ahead, Anthony.  You know why we got such good audio?  Pat, it was at the end of it.  Everyone was gone, and he just kept going and going, so he got some very good audio of  Pat puking.  Right.  With this many people, it's so hard to get that pristine sound of that warbling puke of  eggnog just coming up and washing over the garbage pail. 
[02:25:00]  Pure tsunami.  It's just not going down anymore.  Oh, boy.  What's the matter now?  What happened?  There's no room.  There's no room.  There's room.  You can do it.  They just completed their room at the game.  There's 30 seconds left to recover.  They just completed their, most of the guys have completed their 25th double shot of eggnog.  We're up to 50 ounces.  Come on, Tom.  Do the Kobayashi shake, man.  Yeah, he does that shake.  Get the air out.  Shake it off, man.  Wait, Tom has to finish that or he's out? 
[02:25:30]  No.  Oh, you made it.  Yeah.  All right.  Everyone made it?  Don't just stare at it.  Drink it.  Let's sit.  Tap out.  Wait, who's tapping out?  Jay's going.  Jay's going?  No?  I'm tapping.  Wait, who's this guy?  Who are you, bro?  Tony.  Tony.  Oh, Tony.  I got hit the bathroom.  I think I'm going to do some of my pants.  All right, Tony, 330-pound competitor from Jersey's out.  We're down to eight competitors.  Thank you, Tony.  Farewell, fellas.  Thank you.  We're up to another shot.  Go, guys.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:26:00]  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Oh!  What, you lift something in there?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Split, splash, I was taking a bath.  Tom's puking now, too.  That sounds guilty.  I need a help from me.  Yeah, you will handle my ass.  Oh, this is Lester Wilkins. 
[02:26:30]  Let's hear it for Jay, man.  Give it up for Joe.  Hey!  With that, with that, you guys got to do another shot.  Whoever's left, 27, go.  Well, Jay is puke, and Tom puke, too.  Tom puke, too.  Tom puke, too.  Tom puke, too.  Yeah, Tom.  Great job.  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you, guys.  Tommy from Brooklyn's out, too.  Some of the best puke audio I've ever heard.  Ever.  Ever.  Wow.  Oh, with the gurgling.  Oh, that gurgling was fantastic. 
[02:27:00]  Like a sucking chest wound.  All right, here we go.  I think we're down to six guys.  Garbage Dick.  Jams from Massachusetts.  Chris from Delaware.  Will.  Pat from Monocchi.  And, of course, Eric Badlands Booker.  Yeah.  I might have lost track, but I think this is their 27th double shot of eggnog.  Badlands.  That puke doesn't even affect you, right?  You've seen it.  Oh, man.  I've seen the worst puking ever, man.  I bet.  Well, I want to ask you, what is the worst puking you've ever seen anyone do at one competition? 
[02:27:30]  But you'll have to tell us after your shot, which is in, like, five seconds.  Okay, here we go.  Is this the 28th right now or the 29th?  Well, whatever it is, do it.  All right, go.  I think that's 28.  There we go.  And what was it?  Worst puke ever?  Uh, at the Glutton Bowl eating cow brains.  Oh, shit.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:28:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  Give Tom to that guy.  They said I could talk here.  Is this working?  That's working.  I'm the original Tippi Tom.  This is food.  I'm the original food.  All right, listen.  We're repositioning some of the contestants.  So they have easier access to the pails.  It seems like a good idea, but get Tippi Tom and these guys out for a little bit.  No, there are false Tippi Toms out there.  But I am the real.  All right, get them out. 
[02:28:30]  The real, true, live Tippi Tom.  All right, Tom, we'll get you back.  Tom, yeah, we'll have you back.  All right, let's go.  Wait, is that guy?  Uh-oh, wow, you're a little paler than you are when you...  All right, go, the 29th shot.  Oh, my God.  Badlands like it was nothing.  Eric Badlands, Booker like it was nothing.  Pat from Minaki like it was nothing.  Chris like it was nothing.  We've been...  The heaviest guys in the contest will.  We've been repositioned, so we now have a good view of the puke in the garbage can. 
[02:29:00]  I'm going to puke.  That's all right, garbage dick.  All right.  How you doing, man?  That's very good.  A little low on the action.  We're down to six competitors, Anthony.  Well, after that display of puking, wow.  All I can say is wow.  Anyone else getting close?  Chris.  Wow, Chris, one of the big guys getting close?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I actually think I'm going to get out.  Really?  Yeah.  That bad?  I'm very disappointed in myself.  What's your name again, bro? 
[02:29:30]  Will.  Will might be out, eh?  Wow.  Will he throw up?  Yeah, definitely.  Will was the guy that announced, I win.  A little overconfident.  All right, here we go.  With that said, this would be the, I guess, the 30th double shot of eggnog.  30.  And there we go.  Pat taking it down in two sips that time.  Uh-oh, Pat.  I wasn't sure if it was time or not.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you're looking at the clock, so you got to tip your cup back down to get a better look at the clock. 
[02:30:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Silly me.  I'm tapping out.  I'm done.  Wow.  Will's out.  But I will perform.  All right, Will's going to be a little arm.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  He's going to be a real trooper.  Here we go.  Will.  Will.  Right here.  All right.  Mic it.  Eric, you got the mic right in front of you.  All right.  Here we go.  He's going to perform for us.  Christ.  Oh, my God.  Dude, we just had dueling pukes. 
[02:30:30]  Did we just have a...  Dude, we just had dueling pukes.  Oh, there's puke coming out his nose with a big booger.  Oh, God.  Dude, there's snot and eggnog coming out your nose. 
[02:31:00]  I got to get a shot of that.  Don't...  Oh, no.  Wait, garbage dick.  Garbage dick.  I stand next to two guys puking.  Yeah, that's a little rough.  I'm out.  I can't do it.  He's tapping?  All right, he's...  Garbage dick is out.  All right, look.  Wow.  Oh.  All right.  Did everyone do the other shot there?  Yeah.  In the middle of that, you guys should have done a shot.  If not, we'll give you a little leeway, but there you go.  Are you believable?  Shh.  Uh-oh. 
[02:31:30]  Shh.  Who's going?  Garbage dick.  Garbage dick.  Garbage dick's puking out of his nose, Ant.  Oh, God damn it.  Chris is going to throw up again.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Keep puking out of his soup.  Oh, God damn it.  Just hold your eggnog if you're still in the contest. 
[02:32:00]  We'll get back to you in a minute.  It's coming out of his nose.  It's the only reason why I keep going.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  What's Mr. Crimson's first name?  Ralph.  Garbage dick is putting on a show.  And so did Chris.  Yeah.  And so did Will.  Holy shit.  The sound.  Oh, wow.  Holy crap.  Was that crazy?  Frightening.  Garbage dick, you want another thick shot? 
[02:32:30]  Go to the tippy top.  Another thick, delicious, sugary eggnog.  All right.  Unbelievable.  And that's it.  Let's hear it for Chris and Will and Garbage dick.  Fantastic.  Stopping the competition.  I don't even know where we're at.  We're ready for the 30-second double shot of eggnog.  Oh, Lysol being sprayed now.  All right.  We're down to three guys?  Yep.  Jams, you're still in? 
[02:33:00]  Can we call the...  All right.  Jams is still in.  Let's move the guys over.  Jams is the small guy that's left.  210 pounds from Massachusetts.  Oh.  We got Pat from Menaki.  And of course, we got Eric Badlands Booker.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Are you good for that one?  We said it was going to come down a pad in Eric.  Yep.  It's looking pretty good right now for that.  Oh.  All right.  I don't...  God, was that disgusting.  You guys didn't do any shots during that, right?  No.  They had a little break.  All right.  A little break.  So we're going to be back on track in 10 seconds.  I think this would be the 30-second double shot of eggnog, right? 
[02:33:30]  Sounds good to me.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Oh, God.  Give or take a shot, I guess.  And we're back in with these three guys.  Go.  All right.  Now we're getting into the real competition, Anthony.  Yeah.  But, man, what a show those guys put on for us.  Holy shit.  I was hoping for at least what happened last year.  Yeah.  You know, a couple of boofs and then the big finale with Pat.  We've already surpassed last year's puking. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  As far as entertainment puking goes this year.  I didn't know there was a double puking thing going on.  There was two heads going back and forth.  They were like scalp to scalp.  Oh, you will be.  Oh, really?  You feeling it?  Yeah.  And they were puking at the same time and the gurgling noise, it was almost like they were  puking in harmony.  Yeah.  It was wonderful.  It looked like a fountain going on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Badlands, how are you?  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm just giving him some tips, you know. 
[02:34:30]  Tips of the trade.  Tips.  He's feeling a little, he's hitting the wall right now, you know.  You've seen this before.  Yeah.  We don't want to have him have urges contrary.  And go.  Here it is.  33rd double shot of eggnog.  That's 66 ounces of goodness.  Of holiday goodness.  Holiday goodness.  All right.  Oh, my line disappeared.  I've got a dot left.  Uh-oh.  Eric's trying to keep it fair for everybody. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I've got to keep it fair.  I've got to keep it fair, you know.  All right.  How are you feeling?  Full.  Yeah.  James, you're feeling full, huh?  Oh, yeah.  But very impressive, man.  You're in third place right now.  Very impressive.  You beat out some really big guys.  What did Pat do?  40 last year?  Oh, 70.  70.  70.  I'm almost halfway there.  How sick is that?  We might have to double up the shots. 
[02:35:30]  I don't know.  We'll see how this goes.  These two, they're going to be.  They're not even blinking yet.  Yeah.  And go.  34th double shot of eggnog.  Oh, God damn.  That was great.  Double puking.  I want to go.  Oh, the double puking.  Real fast.  Jeff in Utah.  Jeff, what's going on?  Yeah, it's John from Utah.  You guys are evil bastards.  This is the third time you guys have made me puke in my own truck. 
[02:36:00]  No, come on.  I don't know if your radio show is supposed to make you puke, but all right.  How does it sound out there?  Good?  You're digging it?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Who's tapping?  Who's tapping?  James is out.  I'm definitely going to puke.  All right.  We'd love to hear it.  You've got 15 seconds.  Oh, that was uneventful. 
[02:36:30]  Well, that wasn't.  We're down to two guys.  We're going to make you guys get ready for the 35th shot as he's puking.  Are you going to finish your shot?  Wow.  And go.  35th shot of eggnog.  Double shots, obviously.  We're up to 70 ounces.  He just puked, and now he's finishing his shot.  Oh, wow.  Like a true competitor.  Fucking trooper.  Super jams.  Thank you, James.  Great job.  Great job.  Great job.  Fuck.  Jams from Massachusetts.  And wow. 
[02:37:00]  And just like we thought, it's between Pat from Menachie and Eric Badlands Booker.  And that's it.  Yes.  What's good, Pat?  Hey.  Hanging in there?  Oh, yeah.  Trying to.  Feeling kind of full?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  About halfway to where I was.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  You're feeling the stomach's, you know, the distension coming out of me.  I'm starting to knock on my ribs.  Yeah.  They're starting to psych each other out.  Feeling urges contrary to swallowing, aren't you? 
[02:37:30]  You want you uttering a.  Elvis wants to leave the building.  That's right.  You want to have a reversal of fortune.  Here it is, the psych out.  And here we go.  The 36th double shot of eggnog.  Bam.  They're both slamming him back like it's nothing.  Pat, how are you feeling?  Wonderful.  Eric seemed to be able to slam it down.  I'm just letting gravity do its job.  What's my name, Pat?  What's good?  Oh, look at that.  What's my name?  Top-ranked American eating champion, a.k.a. the all-day buffet, and when it comes to drinking 
[02:38:00]  eggnog, I don't play.  What you do in the week?  I do in mere minutes.  But all-you-can-eat buffets out of business.  Just in case you forgot who this is, it's Badlands Booker in effect.  Bear witness.  I can't rhyme, but that ain't no crime.  That was not bad.  That was gangster.  Goddamn Pat, man.  That's why people are pulling for him. 
[02:38:30]  Yes, of course.  It's shit like that.  You guys want to do a speed round or no?  Speed round.  Well, let's get the 37th double shot of eggnog.  Go.  Because this could take a while.  I'm just thinking maybe we speed it up slightly.  But it's got to be up to you guys.  You guys got to agree.  What, like every 30 seconds?  Would you guys go within all-every 30 seconds?  Yeah.  Want to do it?  Want in a room?  Let's do it.  You want to do it?  Let's do it.  All right, we'll go to the top of the hour here, and then we're going to move it to every 
[02:39:00]  30 seconds, okay?  10 more minutes.  Huh?  10 more minutes, you mean?  Or top of the hour?  I mean, top of the hour as far as this shot goes.  Let him go the whole minute here.  Sorry, I should have explained better.  Oh, it's all right.  I think we're up to 37 double shots of eggnog.  Eric, are you close to puking?  All right, nowhere close, man.  Come on.  Nowhere close.  I'm good.  Pat?  I'm here for the long haul, Pat.  Me too.  It's going to look like Life of Brian.  Somebody's going to have a wafer-thin eggnog and explode. 
[02:39:30]  Meaning of life.  Sugar.  Whatever.  Money final.  It's English, I guess.  All right, here we go.  We're going to start every 30 seconds now.  That gets the movie wrong.  Here we go.  This is...  Which one is going to get cancer?  Now we've got to speed up.  This is the 38th double shot of eggnog.  They both slammed it.  Now we're going every 30 seconds.  This is going to get brutal fast, I think.  Pat, you all right?  Oh, just peachy. 
[02:40:00]  And Pat's a diabetic.  This is not...  No.  This is not...  Not smart?  I got nine toes left.  All right.  And now we're going every 30 seconds.  So, guys, go.  39th double shot of eggnog.  All right.  Good to the last drop.  Good to the last drop.  Good.  That was so frigging disgusting, man.  Let's go to Kevin the trucker real fast.  Kevin, make it fast.  All right.  Hey, Doug.  You guys, the audio was awesome.  It just sounds absolutely awesome. 
[02:40:30]  You guys are kicking ass.  All right.  Thank you, Kevin.  Yeah.  They're enjoying it out there.  This will be the 40th double shot of eggnog.  Go.  That's 80 ounces, Anthony.  80 ounces of eggnog.  40 shots in.  That's a lot.  And we're going to go every 30 seconds here.  And pourers, make sure those cups are empty when you pour them.  Going strong, man.  All right. 
[02:41:00]  A nice lull in the action.  Yeah.  We needed that.  That's at that display.  And go.  41.  That's got his pinky out.  Real gentleman.  Pat, anything?  No, I'm fine.  Yeah?  All right.  What are we up to?  The lot needs no excuse for not being proper etiquette.  What?  It's starting to affect my speech. 
[02:41:30]  Humor.  It's going to be all good, Pat.  Don't worry.  Just let that out, and you can kick the jokes again.  And go.  That's 42, Anthony.  42.  42.  Now, Pat did 70 of these last time?  Yeah.  That's why we're going with the speed round.  Yeah.  Wow.  I'm not feeling hungry. 
[02:42:00]  Not feeling hungry.  All right.  And with that, here comes number 43.  Go.  43.  All right.  Pat, you want to promote anything?  Want to promote your Christmas dinner with Anthony?  Yeah.  Everybody be there.  Yeah.  Everybody.  LocklearBikery.com.  All right.  And don't forget, if you want to get that competitive eating theme hip-hop, IFOCE.com or 
[02:42:30]  BarrettLandsBooker.com.  All right.  Get home and focus, y'all.  I can smell the vomit.  And here we go.  44.  Can you start smelling the vomit now, right?  Yeah, out of the garbage cans.  Yeah.  And the 44th double shot of eggnog is done.  Come on, Pat.  Hang in there, buddy.  Hang in there.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  They're suggesting we do body shots off Tippi Tom.  Oh.  Oh.  Stop it.  Like that scene in From Dusk to Dawn, the booze off Soma Fank's leg. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, don't even try it.  Pat.  What happened?  Yeah.  Pat, just slow down.  That was the meaning of life.  Slowly going into his coma.  Go ahead.  Hit it.  45th double shot of eggnog.  Oh, yeah.  The pukes bell just hit.  Wow.  Come on, man.  Take it.  Nope.  What are you, gay?  I'll take it.  All right.  If you enjoy pukes, mouth, you're a man.  A man?  You don't guys have paid to have people puke in their mouths for a moment in the shower?  I thought somebody was ready to puke there. 
[02:43:30]  No.  I didn't know what was going on there.  I heard some noise.  All right, guys.  We're getting ready for number 46 here.  46.  Go.  Let her rip.  Let her rip.  Uh-oh.  Eric is finishing them a little faster than Pat right now.  Yeah.  He was finishing them quick from the start.  Yeah?  He's doing a different strategy than you?  Eric, how are you feeling?  I'm feeling pretty good.  I'm, you know, feeling a little, you know, I'm starting to feel a little bit, but, you  know, it's all up in the mind. 
[02:44:00]  Starting to feel it a little bit, though.  Yeah.  I'm starting to feel it in my stomach.  The thing about it is that, you know, it doesn't help you.  You've got to be hungry and focused.  The mind rules everything.  Remember that, Pat.  All right.  Hit it.  47.  That's everything.  Wow.  These guys are really hammering it.  Badlands has definitely had a little bit of problems getting that one down.  Really?  Yes.  Yeah.  Because there was a burp coming out.  Oh, okay.  All right.  There was a burp coming out.  Yeah.  If it's coming out, it can't go in, right?  I thought we were on to something finally.  No, no.  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:44:30]  We're coming up to, I guess this would be 48.  He's feeling it.  You think he's feeling it?  I know he is.  Sure he is.  And I believe this will be the 48th double shot of eggnog.  Go.  No problem.  Bathroom.  We've got Sonny from the bathroom, by the way.  Sonny Ferelli from the bathroom.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm doing bathroom suit patrol, and these guys are puking by the bucket.  I hope we have audio in there. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  We're going to try to get some audio right now.  All right.  Yeah, the competitors are in the bathroom.  Should we keep in there?  Yeah.  All right.  And here goes the 49th double shot of eggnog in the studio.  We've got Sonny Ferelli on the phone.  The guys that got knocked out, they're still puking in the bathroom.  It's still cold.  It's still cold coming up.  It's still cold.  Are you ready?  Is that video camera ready?  It's fucking puking.  Oh, all right.  Your phone.  Your phone sucks, Sonny.  Jesus. 
[02:45:30]  All right.  My phone sucks.  Yeah, thanks for the update from the bathroom now.  Here we go.  This will be the 50th double shot of eggnog.  Hit it.  This is for United States, 50 states.  All right.  Thanks, Pat.  That would be 100 ounces of eggnog.  This is still 20 shy of where Pat can go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why we wanted to speed this up a little bit.  We'd be here all day.  Are you hurting? 
[02:46:00]  Anything?  Pat?  Uh, I felt better.  Hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  They're feeling it.  That speed round really has a cut down on their game.  Oh, yeah.  Go.  51.  A lot less shit talking.  Yep.  Yeah, they're not shit talking.  And they're not even wiping their mouths anymore.  That's the other fucked up.  Yeah.  It's just staying on their faces.  They don't care.  Eric?  I'm feeling good.  I'm still in the race.  Still in the running.  It's feeling good.  When I go, I'm going to go.  Uh-oh.  You're getting close, Pat. 
[02:46:30]  Be honest.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  This thing, he's not making 70 this year.  I don't know.  I think I...  It's the speed.  Oh, the speed.  You're right.  He hasn't had the time.  Let's go.  See how quick?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  This could be it for Pat?  52?  Badlands is wavering, Pat.  He's not there yet, but he's wavering.  Pat?  He might be playing possum.  I don't know.  I don't know what kind of strategy Pat came in here with.  Oh, well.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God. 
[02:47:00]  Jimmy!  Jimmy's farting.  God damn you.  That was to improve the smell in this room.  It's all vomit.  Go.  53.  Ooh, Eric had...  Yeah, Eric had to shrug that one off.  Yeah.  Pat, Eric had to shrug.  Pat's having some trouble, though, too.  Yeah, this is going to be over soon.  Uh, if Pat's nodding his head, he just nodded his head.  Yeah, this will be over soon.  Hang in there, Pat.  Pat lands his wavering a little bit. 
[02:47:30]  Pat, you're the current champ.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Look what's up on my MySpace.  There's a picture of the champs going head-to-head right here.  And a double puking.  I actually have a picture of a double puking on MySpace.  And if you guys are my friend, you can go and see that.  You can see it even if you're not your friend.  No, you can't.  Pat, are you drinking that?  Well, you can be my friend.  Yeah, I'm waiting for the next friend.  Did you guys both drink the last one?  Yeah.  Okay.  I didn't see it.  Wow.  Okay.  I want to get the stunning finish over here. 
[02:48:00]  You don't have to be your friend to see that.  You can be Jim Norton's friend and just go over and have a new page.  You don't want to be.  You don't want to be.  You don't want to be.  You don't want to be.  Here we go.  Scared.  55.  Bam.  That's 110 ounces.  They look like...  Well, Pat looked like he was done five ago.  Was that a fart?  Yeah.  Backfire.  Eric Bedland's book that's farted.  Wow.  Making room any way he can.  Excuse me, America.  That was like a milk fart, too. 
[02:48:30]  Lactose gives him a problem.  It does.  Hang in there, Pat.  Lactose gives this fellow a problem.  Yeah, let's go.  Go.  56.  Give or take one.  I know.  We might have missed one here, but...  Oh, man.  That's nasty.  Pat, everyone...  Oh, this puke fart.  What do you expect?  It's a lactose fart.  Let's go to Oklahoma.  Ed, go.  Real fast.  Pat, go, man.  Do it.  You mind to it?  Bet you can do it.  Come on, Pat.  First, you can do it. 
[02:49:00]  Punch him out, guys.  All right.  Everyone is encouraging Pat.  Inspired Otis.  Go ahead, Mike.  Yeah, Pat.  I just wanted to say, you can do it, man.  Celine Dion's been doing that every merry day of her life.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  That's 57.  That's the 57th shot.  Double shot right there.  Speed round.  Genius.  Speed round.  Yeah.  Needed the speed round.  Oh, this would have taken all day.  Pat, you hanging in there for a little more?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Eric's farting. 
[02:49:30]  He's drooling.  Look at it.  He's drooling, man.  It's all in his...  He's not cleaning up his beard anymore.  His mustache and beard.  He's not cleaning.  Pat's not either, but it's just more obvious.  He's got his game face on.  Go.  58.  Bam.  He's making room.  Yep.  Oh, man.  If he shits his pants, I will laugh harder than I've ever laughed in my life.  He's not going to shit pants.  No, no, no.  Well, that fart was a little wet.  We'd appreciate it if you did.  A little damp.  Yeah, that fart had problems.  We'd plug your CD every day for the next year.  Oh, my God.  You want to sell CDs if you shit your pants? 
[02:50:00]  Uh-oh.  No, no, no, no.  I thought he was going to shit.  Oh, no.  Just fire out, like, one push.  Just down the back of one leg.  And go.  Plug it every day.  59.  Hmm.  Pat, a little longer.  He's been doing that the whole time, though.  He's pacing himself.  Yeah.  That's right.  I'm from Pace University.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Pace University.  Guys, we're getting ready for the 60th double shot of eggnog. 
[02:50:30]  What's the matter, Pat?  No.  Eric wanted me to hold mine.  He said I'm busy holding eggnog in.  And go.  This is 60.  Ten away from what Pat did last year.  Yeah.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Unki in Rhode Island.  Unki.  Yo, Pat.  You're representing the OA Army, man.  Don't let us down.  Don't make us lose what little respect we got for you.  All right.  There you have it. 
[02:51:00]  Thanks, Unki.  That's no comment.  Breathing a little heavier.  Yeah.  There's no smack talking going on.  No.  I must say, though, they are both champions because they've cleared this room out.  Smell that puke out of that garbage can, too, as you're drinking.  How do you suck that stuff down with that liquid?  That stinks.  I can smell it from here.  61 is done.  Oh, my nose receptors are cut off.  Yeah.  61 is done.  Denise has love in her eyes for Eric Badlands.  Yeah.  Well, of course.  She's pretty sexy up here. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, you're digging that.  She likes to suck on the black cock, too, so you might be able to imagine.  Yeah, she does.  She does.  All right.  It's been documented.  It's been documented.  We're not saying anything out of turn here.  Here we go.  62.  Go.  All right, now we're getting close to what Pat did last year, Anthony.  Look at Pat.  Hang in there.  Someone is saying every shot Pat takes, his dad will love him even more.  Ooh.  Oh.  She's sorry, Pat.  Love me, Daddy.  She's been right. 
[02:52:00]  There's a love me, Daddy thing going on here, yes.  He's home rooting for you.  Wow.  You can do it, too.  Wow.  That really does stink in here.  No, you don't want to spray that, Denise.  Leave it.  It's good.  It helps us out.  Yeah, it's sexy.  You can tell there's a woman in the studio.  Go.  Go.  This is 63.  Well, she is standing right by it.  Grilled snakes.  Just pretend you're going down on Paul.  Eric, what's up, bro?  What's up?  You ain't talking.  Feeling a little bit.  Feeling a little bit. 
[02:52:30]  Feeling a little bit.  This is where who wants it most, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  I've never seen Pat so quiet.  He's fucking determined.  He is.  This is the new competitive eating Pat.  Like, we haven't seen this Pat.  This is how he is with his game face when he goes to these competitive eating contests,  and this is how he gets.  He's in the zone, they call it, Opie.  The zone.  Eric is having problems.  He's farting.  He's farting.  He's farting. 
[02:53:00]  You think I can have a seat?  I can have a seat.  We got to stand for this.  Uh-oh.  You got to stand, right?  I think, yeah, the stand thing is.  Why?  What's going on?  Are you going to shit yourself?  No, no, no.  All right.  With that, go.  He wants a seat.  He's farting.  How's the fart smell, Denise?  Get your face down.  You don't want to know.  Get your face down.  You don't want to know.  All right, they just did 65, Anthony.  65 double shots eggnog.  That's 130 ounces.  Oh, my God.  Pat did 70 last year.  Come on.  And then made himself puke. 
[02:53:30]  And Pat's better this year.  He has hands on his hip akimbo.  Is that a new one?  Pat's not even talking.  I'm speechless.  Yes, you are.  You're speechless.  And with that, we go to 66.  Let's tell you that Voss one time said one of his favorite actors was Don Cheadle.  He pronounced the A in Cheadle's name.  Cheadle.  He is a dolt.  He's as dumb as they come.  Nothing against Eric, but the phones are lit.  Everyone is encouraging Pat.  Yeah.  They are encouraging Pat.  He's the hometown boy.  I'm a great white dope. 
[02:54:00]  He's also the 15th trying to beat the fourth.  He's the underdog.  That's right.  He's the underwhelm.  We started with 15.  We're down to these two.  Eric, Badlands Booker, go.  And, of course, Pat from Minoc.  Pat is invincible, of course.  And that's 67 done.  Eric?  Eric?  Your stomach is bubbling.  My stomach is bubbling.  I can hear it.  Denise, get on mic.  What's going on?  You're the closest.  Gurgling.  His stomach, you can actually hear gurgling sounds coming from it. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hang in there, Pat.  Something's definitely coming up to me.  With the, um, with the, with the, with the, with the Lysol and the Scott tissue in a minute.  Oh, man.  All right.  See, he is having a tough time.  Wait a second.  All right.  68.  Well, you have the 30 seconds, so there you go.  Wait for the next one.  All right.  68's done.  Get in there, Pat.  Hurry, get another eggnog.  Hurry, hurry, get another eggnog.  We've got a speed round coming up here.  Eric might shit his pants, and that's how he's going to lose his conscience, by the way. 
[02:55:00]  That lactose intolerant thing might get the best of him.  Yeah, that's what I figured may be the, uh, deciding factor.  Who would have seen that coming?  And here we go, the 69th double shot of eggnog.  Good number.  MySpace.  They just both did it?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Ugh, different brand.  Look.  Anthony, uh, hopefully my, my counting is right.  This will be where Pat ended up last year.  Coming up.  Really?  70th double shot of eggnog.  He's hanging in there. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  Whew.  Pat, this will match what you did last year.  That is correct.  And here we go.  And go.  The 70th double shot.  Pat's better than he was last year.  Now we're into unfamiliar territory, finally.  Come on, you're feeling it, Pat.  You're feeling it.  Eric just kind of trying to swallow it.  You are feeling like you want to puke.  You're feeling like you want to just go...  Eric is, uh, not believable anymore. 
[02:56:00]  Look how big Eric's belly has gotten, too.  He's not believable anymore.  It's even bigger than it was.  He's only a man, Pat.  That's right.  That's right, Pat.  Go!  71.  This is a new record for the eggnog drinking contest, by the way.  New record.  I like that.  New record.  I like the sound of that.  Hold in there, Monaki.  Swallow it.  Come on, Pat.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, could it be true? 
[02:56:30]  Come on.  I have to join in.  There's more.  Come in.  This is a sad day.  It's a very sad day.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, jeez.  Don't get in my cup, dude.  It's a very sad day.  To see the former champion going down, vomiting like this.  It's like watching Ali going down. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, boy.  Here.  Oh, this is a sad, sad moment for sport, ladies and gentlemen.  A sad, sad moment for sport.  This is very sad.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God.  Earth Badlands has started up here, too.  Goddamn, I could have went one more.  Oh, he was so close.  Now, what happens?  Because they both puked on the same shot.  No, Pat puked first.  Oh, Pat.  Okay. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, first to puke.  Pat puked first.  Oh, well.  Eric?  Eric just puked and then finished his shot, threw it in the garbage and said, give me the  trophy.  Eric.  I'm good.  Badlands Booker.  Wow.  The winner of the eggnog drinking contest for 2005.  Oh, and Pat.  You've got to be proud, Pat.  Yeah, Pat.  You've got to be proud.  You lost my hat.  You took on and, you know.  Oh.  Holy shit. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, Badlands is hurting.  No, no, no, I'm not hurting.  I'm good.  Holy shit.  Hey, congratulations.  Hey, man.  Thank you.  You're a trooper man who comes to this eggnog.  That's why they call you Badlands.  Look how close it was, too.  It was really close.  They both puked on the 71st shot.  Really close.  71st double shot of eggnog.  Sorry, it was just, came, the fill came right out of my throat as I was drinking.  What's the matter, Denise?  Toughen up a little, huh?  Oh, come on. 
[02:58:30]  I did.  What's wrong?  Smell it.  It is, ugh.  Yeah, there's a wall of puke.  It's like totally repulsive.  Where's Bill?  Is he here?  No, is Bill here?  Why?  Yeah, Bill is here.  Smell it.  We could play make Bill puke.  Do you think he would if he had to stick his head in that thing and just start breathing heavy?  Well, let's, uh...  Oh, whoa.  They're making some sound.  Ben has entered the studio.  Ben will not come in, by the way.  Remember, Ben is such a pukephobe.  Yeah.  He won't even come in the same room. 
[02:59:00]  I want to throw Ben in that trash can.  That would be funny.  All right, we got lots of prizes for the guys.  Pat from Monocchi, not happy.  Pat, don't be bummed out.  Pat, please don't.  You know, you were the once great champion last year, second place this year, but look  at who you're going against.  This man is professional.  71 double shots, 6,390 calories, 6,390 calories, 319 grams of fat.  Not too bad.  Pat, did you get it all out of you because you got the diabetes? 
[02:59:30]  More or less.  More or less?  There's still something in there.  He's pushing on his guts.  All right, we want to make sure you're all right.  Of course we do.  The pressure's down.  Danny, what do we got for the winners?  We have a Delphi MiFi with, I believe, some kind of subscription.  I don't know how long it is.  Probably a year.  We'll figure it out.  A brand new Nintendo DS with Mario Kart DS and season two of the World Poker Tour on DVD. 
[03:00:00]  And who gets what?  Well, I don't think Pat gets anything.  Oh.  We have to get something.  Oh, my God.  That's Christmas.  That's Christmas.  This was his Christmas presents.  We even have his...  He's got to get something.  You used that one already.  He doesn't get anything?  Is that what happened?  We'll see if we have a consolation prize.  Oh, he's got to get the consolation prize.  Maybe a wow sticker?  This is so sad.  How about some eggnog?  The t-shirt he's wearing.  Wow. 
[03:00:30]  Well, here's the deal.  Pat, any final words?  You wore the champ.  I feel like a big loser.  No, no.  Huh?  Get the Hulk music?  Yeah.  Anthony, why don't you...  No wonder my daddy left me.  Hey, hold on, Pat.  Hold on.  We're getting your music ready.  You know, you were the champ.  You were on top of the world last year.  And now this year, no one's going to even remember you were in the contest.  Who remembered who came in second place last year?  I didn't.  There was that guy...  Yeah. 
[03:01:00]  That other loser.  All right.  Uh, Anthony, you ready?  All right.  Go ahead, Pat.  Say goodbyes.  Pat.  Goodbye, fellas.  I know when I'm not wanting to be around here anymore.  Poor guy.  I won't go away unhappy.  I'll just go away.  Yes, Pat.  Once former champion.  Sniffle, sniffle.  One year.  That's how long he held it. 
[03:01:30]  One.  What happened?  Pat.  They're saying you have to go.  Kurt.  Does somebody have some gamma radiation for me?  No.  No.  Pat, it's time.  Pat.  Let's get Pat out of the studio.  Good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  Oh, good news.  We found some prizes for you.  Hold on.  Don't leave just yet.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Danny, I want to announce what Pat from Menaki won for coming in second place in the eggnog drinking contest. 
[03:02:00]  Of course, it's also Christmas, so we figured we had to give him something.  Pat's going to be getting Trinity's Glittered Probe.  What is that?  It's 10 inches.  It's glittered, jelly-beaded probe with sturdy, removable screw-on suction cup.  Is it a butt plug?  It's for wherever you'd like it to be.  Oh.  So that's for Pat.  All right.  What else?  We also have Whatever It Takes DVD from Vivid Video. 
[03:02:30]  Multiple Angles with Kelly Marie.  Oh.  All right.  Nice porno for you, Pat.  You are lonely.  A private sensual bath collection from Spice.  Very nice.  It comes with a nice six-inch body massager.  A little do-not-disturb sign on it.  It's got strong batteries.  And poker for lovers.  Poker?  I don't even know it.  For all the people that you love dearly in your life, Pat, you can play this with them.  That's right.  It sounds like it's a strip poker type of game there, Pat.  Oh, it's not true.  It's called Solitaire. 
[03:03:00]  It's called Solitaire.  Play it alone.  Isn't that nice?  Punch your crap.  Play it alone.  Oh, thank you.  All right, Pat.  Well, we don't want to take up any more of Badlands time because you're a friend of the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Badlands is ready for his photo ops.  So, Pat, if you could remove yourself, that would be great.  It's the great champion.  All right.  The guy has earned it.  Just like your father, you're leaving.  Oh. 
[03:03:30]  Oh.  I had a nice year.  It was cute.  He'll look back in the archives and think, oh, yeah, that guy was fun.  And there they go.  Oh, there he goes.  They're kind of applauding for him out there.  Yeah.  Keep the door open so we can hear the applause.  Oh.  All right.  The other competitors are applauding Pat as he left the studio.  There's the champ.  Could you raise your arms in victory, sir?  Yeah.  Can you raise your arms?  Yeah.  There we go.  Wonderful.  Hold on.  The phones are really good right now.  Andrew from Brooklyn.  Andrew. 
[03:04:00]  But, Pat, he's the champ.  Watch out.  That's very good.  All right.  Wow.  That was something.  You were really impressive, man.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks a lot.  And it was such a close finish.  Yep.  It makes it great.  Pat's going to lose sleep over that one.  Yeah.  He really is.  Well, Eric raps.  He's got a lot of stuff to bring to the radio program.  He's kicked at 71, though.  Yep.  Half a shot away.  Actually, there's, yeah, they both hold the record, officially. 
[03:04:30]  They both hold the record.  Anything you want to plug?  Oh.  As I said before, you've got to get that Hungry and Focus CD.  Hungry and Focus 2, the ingestion engine, is at IFOC.com and BadlandsBooker.com.  And, you know, I've got a MySpace, too, if you want to be my pal.  Anthony has already made you one of his top eight, I think.  Oh, I've got to do that.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, man.  So, oh, man, this is a great day, you know what I'm saying? 
[03:05:00]  And I'd like to thank, you know, Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for having me.  No problem.  It's great to have a champion of your caliber here in our studios.  Thanks a lot.  You know, Pat would have won with flying colors again this year if it wasn't for Badlands.  He'd have made those other guys just look stupid.  I don't even remember what third place did.  Something like, not even 40, right?  Yeah, the contest would have been over.  Pat was, like, envisioning the glory of him being alone in the studio, getting some laughs.  Oh, yeah, getting some laughs, like last year.  Yeah, being the star.  Chased everyone out, and he was in there getting laughs last year. 
[03:05:30]  And this year, he came in second very close.  By the way, bring Denise back in the studio.  It's time for Denise to blow Eric, the winner of the eggnog drinking contest.  My God, at least have him force her in a bathroom.  At least he'll have an excuse.  All right, here comes Denise to blow the champion.  Smell that it?  Denise?  Yeah.  Puke?  It's time for you to get on your knees and give Eric...  Are you going to blow him? 
[03:06:00]  No?  Why, you want me to?  Yeah.  Hey, Paul!  Would you go for a BJ from Denise there, Eric?  Getting him all worked up.  Fingers are all moving back.  He's going to shoot a load of eggnog in her mouth.  Hey, Paul.  Hey, Paul.  Hi, honey.  She was on her knees, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  I'm worried.  Hi.  Okay, what's going on?  There's a large Negro and you.  And Eric's building a fake bathroom store, so we speak. 
[03:06:30]  What are you doing?  Well, we figured that she...  He's the winner.  Yeah.  So he gets an extra prize.  Uh-huh.  Well, he hasn't seen it in a while, has he?  So maybe you can...  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  He throws out an insult.  I had to.  That was a low blow.  He throws out the insult.  Yes, that's very good.  Crippled Joe.  Crippled Joe.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  Hello, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Pad Pumanaki is like when you watch a nature show.  The lion who has been dethroned, his teeth are like little worn-down nubs. 
[03:07:00]  He's emaciated and his tail is worn down to just a little stub.  Yeah.  Poor little Pad Pumanaki has been defeated and dethroned and is out now searching for his  final resting ground.  Down goes Pat.  Down goes Pat.  It's all over.  It's a very sad day.  Very sad day.  All right.  Thank you, Crippled Joe.  Thank you, boys.  And finally, yes.  That lens has something.  Yes.  Oh.  Hey, hey, I've got to go use the facilities right now. 
[03:07:30]  I've got to take a huge, massive dump.  Oh, wow.  Let's hope that someone follows Badlands with a microphone.  My wife is not a facility.  I'll be right back.  Just give me like, I'll be back two shakes of a lamb's tail.  Can somebody go follow in there and get some audio?  Can we get the puke buckets out of the studio?  It's really starting to be bad in here.  Yeah, the puke buckets can be dragged down.  Are we getting audio?  Yeah.  Someone follow Badlands.  Badlands, the winner of the eggnog drinking contest has left the studio.  As he's getting, as he leaves the studio. 
[03:08:00]  That was such a close finish.  I was really rooting for that dumb Pat.  Yeah.  Pat was a hometown hero.  You know what it was, though?  It was like Rocky.  Like Rocky won.  He didn't win, but he showed the spirit and the heart.  And he actually was the real winner of that.  He showed a cup.  No, he didn't win, did he?  No.  He did nothing.  He went the distance and still lost.  At least he had a girl to hug.  We're getting him on the phone?  Pat has nobody in the bathroom?  Nothing.  We're following Badlands into the bathroom here. 
[03:08:30]  Poor son of a bitch.  Wow, we've been on the radio for like two straight hours, I think.  Yeah.  Close to two straight hours.  Eric, you're going to call from...  All right, Eric's calling from Badlands is going to explode in there.  Oh, my God.  What a dump he's going to take.  It's not going to be solid.  Dude, he started farting.  They were wet.  How does it liquefy like that quickly inside you?  There was nothing holding that shit back.  Nothing.  The dam was ready to burst. 
[03:09:00]  Pat will lose sleep.  Half a fucking shot.  Half a shot.  Half a shot.  And that was it.  If he just could have held it.  And it wasn't even a matter of him going, I can't do this.  Let me puke.  He was drinking the shot, and it came up on him without any warning.  And let's not forget all of our competitors today, Opie, because some of the boofing,  the puking, the booting, the woofing that went on during that competition, I've never  heard sounds like that in my life.  We're going to have to update our machines. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, my goodness.  I want every one of those on my sound machine.  Of course.  Because those will be played until you get home.  Ad nauseam.  Through the magic of radio, let's go to the bathroom.  We got E-Rock on the phone.  Hey, Opie.  Badland is in a middle stall, and he's surrounded by both homeless guys also taking a dump.  What a treat.  That's after me.  What the hell's going on?  Kippy's trying to talk and sing or something, and Badland's just concentrating. 
[03:10:00]  How you feeling, Badland?  Oh, man.  You feeling all right?  I'm feeling good.  It's all coming on now.  Oh, it's coming out all soft.  Yeah.  It's just like, you know what it is?  It's just kind of like a mudslide sliding into the ocean.  There's no real sound.  No sound.  No sound.  No sound.  I'm picturing it like a lot of damage, but no real noise.  Some Carville soft serve.  D-Rock.  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  This place stinks.  What was that?  It sounded like a depth charge going into the water.  That was Tom flushing for the second time.  Oh, I thought it was L.A. falling into the ocean.  Tom, how you feeling?  Okay.  You all right in there?  Yeah, I'm trying to poo-poo.  I'm trying to poo-poo.  He says he's busy.  He's trying to poo-poo.  All right.  He's not used to doing it outside of his pants. 
[03:11:00]  He's probably not the problem.  It's all good.  Relief now.  Very relieved.  It's a couple of years and it's going to relieve.  It must be a spoon.  Hey, E-Rock.  Keep it full of that, yo.  E-Rock, E-Rock.  Yeah.  Will Badlands allow us to take a picture of his dump?  All right.  Hey, Badlands.  Yeah.  Would you allow us to take a picture of your dump?  After the fact, obviously.  Tell him after, man.  E-Rock.  I already flushed it.  E-Rock, after the...  Eric.  I already flushed it. 
[03:11:30]  Eric.  Eric.  Take a picture of your dump, Badlands.  Oh, I already flushed it.  All right.  I'm in the courtesy flush stage.  He's in the courtesy flush stage.  All right.  That's what's going on in the bathroom.  Thank you, E-Rock.  No problem.  Take a picture of his dump.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, it was a wonderful competition this year.  It really was.  The next thing we do on this show is the homeless shopping spree in a couple weeks.  Yes.  Stay tuned for that lovely, lovely game we play.  All right. 
[03:12:00]  Anthony, I want to play the No Filter Paul thing again.  The Assault on the Media contest has begun for December.  The prizes have gotten even better.  Yeah, this is a great one.  Don't need to list them here right now.  I think the prizes will be up on opiananthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  But No Filter Paul came in today and he did an Assault on the Media.  The video is up on the website.  It's great because the anchor's really, really pissed off.  Anchors are pissed.  The guy on scene is pissed and the anchor has to say something about it.  Finally, he's so angry.  Yeah, listen to this. 
[03:12:30]  This happened earlier.  The video is priceless, like they all are.  I know.  You're looking at the beautiful Rockettes, the stars of the show, the Christmas Spectacular.  A show gets underway today at 10 o'clock tomorrow, 9 o'clock in the morning.  There's tickets available and there's plenty of shows to see.  This is Rhonda.  Where are you from?  I'm from Los Angeles.  Oh, so you must really be enjoying this cold weather that we have here in New York.  Oh, we are really enjoying it.  You know, at some point, well, I'm not even going to dignify it.  Well.  It's a radio team that is very low in the ratings and that's what they need. 
[03:13:00]  What are you going to do?  All right.  He's got to seven.  He's over the clock.  They were so freaking pissed this morning.  He's got to seven.  You see how quick?  That wasn't edited.  The second they cut away, he had a comment.  Oh, he was just kidding.  The second they cut away.  Yes.  You know, satellite radio doesn't have ratings there, Steve.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  We have plenty of people listening.  Don't you worry about it.  Don't you worry.  They're loving and laughing at your little comments this morning.  All right.  What's the deal there, Iraq?  You look a little green. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, that restroom smells like cheese and shit.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We'll be back in like, I don't know, 28 minutes.  No, it's not that bad of a break, is it?  Oh, okay.  Not bad at all.  What do we got left to do today?  We got celebrities here.  Who?  By the way.  Who?  You ever see a movie, Christmas Story?  Yeah.  Celebrities.  From that movie. 
[03:14:00]  From that very movie.  See them out there?  Three of them.  See the red-haired guy?  Remember him?  He's the bully?  That's the bully?  Remember?  What's up, bro?  We're going to get him in next.  We're getting them in next right after you take a break.  The crazy eyes, right?  The yellow eyes?  Uh-huh.  Crazy eyes.  Well, he had the crazy eyes in that movie.  He was on Titus also.  He was in Titus?  Who else we got out there?  Scott Schwartz, who was the kid who stuck his tongue to the pole.  Where's he?  He's actually, you can't see him.  He's just out of your sight there.  All right. 
[03:14:30]  And the fella, Ian, who played the little brother, who couldn't put his arms down.  Are you kidding me?  No.  That's pretty cool, man.  All right, we'll talk to those guys.  Is that eight eyes into the sink?  Yes, that one.  We'll talk to those guys in just a bit.  Anthony, remember the JetBlue, that crazy landing?  Of course.  The audio's finally coming out.  Oh, it did?  Of that landing.  What did you see on the gear?  From the tower perspective, the gear was canted 90 degrees to the left, 
[03:15:00]  instead of the tires being aligned down the runway.  Thank you.  That's all we needed to know.  We'll get back to you.  Wait, what?  What?  There are people that work at a deli that I've seen lose their mind  when the slicer breaks, you know?  What the fuck?  I got sandwiches.  Party.  Fix this fucking thing.  This guy, his plane is fucked up.  He's got a hundred and some odd people behind him.  All right, thanks for the info.  We'll get back to you.  And the thing is, he didn't have to be that cool.  No.  So that's legitimate, that's sincere, righteous coolness. 
[03:15:30]  Coolness.  Because no one hears what it is.  Exactly.  Yeah.  He couldn't be like, what the fuck?  What?  Oh, no.  Does anyone know what we do when this happens?  No.  He just, all right.  Oh, damn.  Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn.  Any way to straighten this out?  Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn.  I saw a movie once.  They dropped Charlton Heston through the roof.  Can someone do that so I don't have to fly this fucking thing? 
[03:16:00]  Oh, boy.  Because I don't have a clue how you deal with a situation like this.  Ladies and gentlemen, is anybody in an Atlanta plane with wheels?  Oh, just come on out, right?  Can somebody hijack this plane so we have an excuse for this moment?  Ladies and gentlemen, we just got information.  Our wheel is canted on 90 degrees.  It's turned 90 degrees to one side.  So we're going to land this thing.  It's either going to be a little bit of sparks.  We're going to be fine. 
[03:16:30]  We're going to be on a 500 mile an hour sit and spin.  So y'all just sit back and I'll get back to you.  That's what I'm going to do.  Get back to you.  Excuse me, stewardess.  What the fuck does canted mean?  That would be the...  I thought we had a problem, but apparently we don't.  The wheels just seem to be canted, which I guess is fine.  We whispered, excuse me, I don't want to...  What the fuck is canted?  I noticed a lot of people working on PCs out there.  Could someone just punch up dictionary.com? 
[03:17:00]  Could you Google?  Put it C-A-N.  Google canted.  And then somebody thinks they know, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think canted means twisted sideways, nigga.  Now I punched a nigga in the face and his jaw was canted.  Now how the fuck...  This nigga have a canted jaw?  You telling me somebody done punched the motherfucking wheels on this plane?  So you're saying the wheels is like this nigga's jaw? 
[03:17:30]  Canted?  The motherfuckers canted?  Sir, calm down, please, sir.  Fuck you?  I told that nigga I knocked up.  Nigga, your jaw's canted.  He was all fucked up.  And that nigga couldn't land.  He crashed right on the side.  He did a crash on his fucking face when I knocked him up in his jaw and it was canted.  Miss, miss, miss, we are fucked up, ma'am. 
[03:18:00]  Holy shit.  Talking to his neighbor.  You know he's fucked up.  Let's just canted.  I canted him in the neighborhood.  God damn that pilot is a genius.  God bless that guy, man.  Cool motherfucker.  Give it to me.  We are all on trust, yeah. 
[03:18:30]  Never get it now.  Never get it now.  We are all on trust, yeah.  Give me some of that stuff.  Ah.  Wow.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  We've got to get the guys in from Christmas Story.  Christmas Story.  Modern day classic, Opie, is what they call that movie. 
[03:19:00]  It's one of those Christmas movies now that we're like, yeah, I don't know.  Guys, sorry to make you waste.  Wizard of Oz.  Something.  We had to do the old drinking contest.  We're scheduled for our...  You can get the Rough Crack crowd coffee.  It's very fucking funny.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, we love the Jimmy Norton.  But don't go to his MySpace.  Yes.  There's a big competition going on here between us.  Gentlemen.  Good morning.  So how do you all get brought together every year or something for around Christmas? 
[03:19:30]  And they decide...  Well, there's a magic Christmas fairy that goes out and spreads candy canes to every single  one of our houses.  And when we lick the candy cane, we're magically transported to a special place where people  pay us money for autographs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's where Kev found you, I guess, huh?  That's where he found me, yeah.  We were living underneath a bridge looking for money.  Yeah.  Because, you know, there's no fucking residuals.  So what you going to do?  Do you get anything off of that movie?  We get fuck all.  Dicked?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got plenty of it.  We get dick.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:20:00]  And it's, you know, played every year now.  Modern day classic is what they call it, I guess.  Yeah, it's called a cash cow from Warner Brothers.  That's what it's called.  Not that the word bitter.  No.  No, you don't sound it.  That's fine.  It's good to start off, like, just angry and pissed.  What kind of money did you get for the actual film the first time you got?  I got five grand Canadian.  Oh!  Hello!  What the hell could that be worth?  Eight dollars a month.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, because this is radio, everyone explain what part you played in the movie.  All right, I'm Zach Ward.  I played Scott Farkas. 
[03:20:30]  I'm the original bad boy.  Right.  You were the bully.  I'm the original redheaded stepchild, yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm Ian Petrella.  I played little Randy Parker.  You were a little kid, man.  You were just a little kid.  Like a real little kid.  You were the one that, you know, had the oversized coat in the snowsuit and had to eat under  the sink because you were a little psychopath or something.  Yep.  And I'm Scott Schwartz.  I was Flick, also known as the Tonguer.  Yeah.  Now I have the famous tongue.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, we know.  It's kind of like how Spider-Man got his radioactive powers. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The pole that they use in Christmas Story, if you watch it close, it glows.  And they brought that pole from Chernobyl.  And after little Scotty stuck his tongue on it, he was imbued with magical power.  He can actually climb a building with his tongue.  He's actually climbing.  It's a beautiful morning in Haman, Indiana.  It starts off with a comic.  Do you even remember doing the movie?  Oh, yeah.  How old were you, though?  I was eight.  Oh, you were eight.  Okay.  I mean, I looked a lot younger.  You know, I was supposed to play like a five-year-old or a four-year-old. 
[03:21:30]  You were eight?  I was eight, and I acted like a five-year-old, so it worked out perfectly.  He had diapers on underneath that outfit, which was great.  How old were you?  I'm 36.  So you were what back then?  13.  13, and...  I was 14.  I'm 37.  You were older than him, and...  I'm the oldest one.  Yeah, but I was the biggest, so I kicked everybody's ass.  It was great.  Now, we know where you went afterwards, what film industry you got into. 
[03:22:00]  Well, was it hardcore or softcore porn?  No, it was the real deal.  It was the real deal.  It was the real deal.  Oh, in my case, it was softcore, but that has nothing to do with it.  You couldn't get a rod?  Huh?  Couldn't get a rod?  No.  No wood in a lumberyard.  Who'd you do sing with?  Julie Ashton.  Oh, she hosts a show on this, I think.  Playboy.  Yeah.  She hosts a show on Playboy.  Jimmy knows every single porn star.  Well, we had them on the show.  We had them on the show.  Yeah, you back there?  In Vegas.  If you want to call it that.  Yeah.  More like Sactor, but that's beside this one. 
[03:22:30]  Sactor.  You know.  Push the helmet in with your two fingers.  Something like that, you know.  What was it, nerves a little?  It's probably got to be a little nerve-wracking.  Yeah, a little bit of that, and you know, just...  There was just other...  I didn't really have a chemistry with her.  We were kind of like, hi, how you doing?  Okay, fine, you know.  We're going to do this.  Yeah, whatever.  Oh, did you want flowers?  No, I wanted...  And a little wine?  No, I wanted like...  Did you want to kiss you and hold you?  No, I wanted like Tyler Faith.  I wanted Sunset Thomas.  I wanted Ashlyn Gear. 
[03:23:00]  Those were the girls that I had an interest in.  Right.  You know.  Dude, ass is ass.  Fuck it.  I mean, I'm sorry.  If I...  I'd reach around and put my finger in that hole and just like,  pa-coosh.  Done.  I'd fuck you if I had a Playboy on your back.  Hey.  So what happened between...  Eh, eh, eh.  And, uh...  Eh, eh.  Yeah, exactly.  What went on between those two movies?  Oh, I mean...  That got you from point A to point B.  No, we all did a lot of other things. 
[03:23:30]  I just...  Yeah.  I mean, my dad and I have a collectibles business out in California.  I mean, I've done a lot of other things besides just point A to point B.  Didn't you know that, like...  I ring-crewed for the WWF for a couple years.  I mean, I did all kinds of stuff.  Oh, yeah.  You worked with Dice, too.  I did some stuff with Dice out in L.A.  Which, by the way, when we were leaving L.A., Ian and I, there's Andrew Dice Clay taking  off.  And we were going to be like, hey, Scotty.  But he's, like, making out with his wife and shit.  And I didn't want to, like, tap him on the show.  That's not his wife.  Trust me, okay?  I got to dump that whore.  Oh, yeah.  Oh!  I got my tongue in this chick's ass. 
[03:24:00]  What did you do with him?  I just did stand-up with him at the comedy store.  Yeah?  Yeah, I was doing, like, this whole bit, Dice Jr., and it was hysterical, you know, so we  had a lot of fun with it for a while.  Dice Jr., you had mini Dice.  Yeah.  I worked there in 89, 90, and 91.  They call it, like, the second golden years at the comedy store.  Yeah.  With Dice, Sam Kinison, Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, Yakov Shmirnov.  I was there.  Well, Yakov, now you're talking the big guy.  Now you've impressed us. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  The only guy that ever tipped me when I worked at the comedy store, when I worked in the  valet, he couldn't get his rolls out, and I pulled it out, and he said, you're a nice  boy.  He's $50.  I said, oh, shit, man.  That's a $50 bill.  He was the only guy that ever tipped me at the comedy store.  Did you assess me about that story?  That Yakov had a Rolls.  Yeah.  That's the most upsetting part of that fucking story.  Exactly.  The man's a fucking genius, and you back off.  All right.  All right.  You jealous fucker.  I am.  You little regular shit.  I am.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to T. Bagger.  T. Bagger.  What's up, fellas? 
[03:25:00]  What do you got?  Hey, how's it going?  Listen, I got to call this cat out.  I do adult films down in Florida, and you don't get to choose who you fuck.  You just show up, and you do it.  If you're a man, you get a rod, and you take care of business.  Or Viagra, or Levitra, or Cialis.  That would be in your case, but considering the deal that I had, we were just trying to  get somebody that I would, you know, have some chemistry with.  It just didn't work.  Well, what's the fucking deal, man?  You like the cock, or what?  I mean, she's a beautiful woman.  Absolutely.  Unfortunately, the week before she worked with me, she worked with Mr. Marcus and Shawn Michaels 
[03:25:30]  and did a DP, and that's like putting the fucking Hugo through a goddamn Lincoln Tunnel,  all right, man?  So what you're saying is you got a little cock.  I'm not Mr. Marcus or Shawn Michaels.  Let's just put it that way.  I know both of them.  I shot both of them on video.  I know what they look like, dude.  He's honest.  It's like my leg.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Charles in Delaware.  Charles.  Hey, Charles.  Hey, Scott, I just want to ask you, what was it like working with Richard Pryor on the  toy, man?  That's insane.  Yeah, fantastic.  I've done that one, too.  Probably the nicest, sweetest, kindest.  They're not enough experlatives to say how great this man is. 
[03:26:00]  After we did the movie, he sent me telegrams, you know, well wishes at the holidays.  An incredible human being.  You actually still hang out with him all the time.  I still see Richard.  I go to his house.  I mean, he's got MS, and he's in bad shape.  Actually, Scotty won't talk about it because he's too cool, but I have no class.  Scotty has actually created a film that is going to be raising money for Richard, and  there's a fucking whack of celebrity stars that are going to be doing cameos in this  movie, and all the money is going to be going towards raising money for MS and Richard. 
[03:26:30]  That's cool.  I think Richard turned 65 yesterday.  Yes, he did.  I think it was his big birthday last year.  You have no idea how jealous I am that you're friends with him.  That really hurts.  He's the greatest.  The thing is, it really showed me how wonderful a person he is when I started putting together  this project, and I went and talked to Whoopi Goldberg, and I talked to Jim Carrey, and  I talked to all the comedians, and the entertainers, and the sports personalities, and I'm like,  I'm doing this thing for Richard, and nobody said, how much are we getting? 
[03:27:00]  It was, where do we have to be, and when do we have to be there?  That's cool.  And that's the reaction I've been getting from everybody.  Did anybody say no?  No.  No.  Nobody has said no.  And Gleason, you got to work with...  Gleason was cool.  He was cool to me.  He just, for whatever reason, he took a liking to me.  I used to do his Smokey and the Bandit schtick from Buford T. Justice, and he thought it was  funny that a 14-year-old kid who was 4'5", tall, who weighed 45 pounds, would do him. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  He thought it was funny, and I had to...  Do it.  Do it.  There's no way, no way that you could come from my loins.  That was it.  The great Gleason.  Yeah, four months.  That damn guy works for Gleason and Pryor.  That's pretty impressive.  Hey, a nice Jewish kid from Jersey gets to be in two Christmas movies.  Go figure.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to John in Jersey.  John?  Jesus.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Actually, I met Zach in L.A. like two years ago for his premiere in Friday, Twister.  I was wondering when that's coming out on DVD. 
[03:28:00]  Hey, how you doing, brother?  How's it going, man?  Last time I saw you, we were dancing, trying to jump around.  Didn't the fucking level five, I think it was?  Yes, and I was hammered off my ass.  Yeah.  You know the funny thing about that?  Look at it up online.  L.A. Twister is a movie I did, gentlemen, that Rotten Tomatoes said was the best independent  feature film of the year.  Hello.  I rewrote half the script, so I'm a fucking genius.  And John, John, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you like the movie?  I thought it was great, man.  What's the name?  I thought your Affleck jokes were fucking funny. 
[03:28:30]  I told you that at the party.  My what jokes?  That Ben Affleck joke?  Oh, yeah.  Ben Affleck sucks my balls, yeah.  There's a lot of Affleck jokes in there, but you know what?  They did a platform release, the distribution company.  They had their heads in their fucking asses.  They had no idea how to sell this thing.  I think they've got the DVD deal starting to come out because it's all hands-on by the  director, who's German, and really doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.  But my mom tells me that, yes, like three days ago, a friend of hers in Sri Lanka had  a bootleg.  Really?  Had a bootleg download of fucking my movie. 
[03:29:00]  What's the movie about?  Movie's about two kids from Boston trying to make it in L.A. inside the industry.  Okay.  And so what they do is they do, they can't make it, so they try to make their own movie,  and it's a movie within a movie, and it sort of crosses back and forth, so people walk  out and go, wait, that was really funny, and I got it.  This is what's going on, right?  You're like, yeah.  It makes you think a little bit, and it sort of culls the herd, because you can see the  retards walking around with that bovine look in their fucking eyes. 
[03:29:30]  But I didn't get it.  They didn't wrap it up for me.  Where's Mickey Mouse and Dono?  And they're like, fuck off, monkey.  But it's a good little movie.  So take a look.  I think, actually, go to the L.A. Twister website.  I think one of the things we've been doing is actually letting it go for free, since  our distributors are such fuck monkeys.  So get it out there, baby.  All right, man.  Thanks, bro.  And what have you been up to, man?  Funny you should ask.  Actually, I've ventured off into the wonderful world of animation and puppeteering.  Animation and puppeteering.  Animation and puppeteering. 
[03:30:00]  Yes, kids.  Just working on some little independent productions of my own that hopefully I will have out within  the next year for everybody to see, you know, tour the short film festival, Spike and Mike  and stuff like that.  Also, right now, if anybody wants to, they can check out my website, which is www.MossCapital.com.  That's M-A-S-K-Capital.  So it's an online magazine that me and my buddy are doing right now. 
[03:30:30]  And it's just a satire parody of the business world.  He does, you know, it's kind of like that gonzo journalism style, you know.  He's kind of like Hunter Thompson.  He writes the articles.  I'm like Stedman.  I do the illustrations, but without the drugs.  So, and actually what I have here, because we want to turn it into a print magazine.  I brought this for you gentlemen.  Ooh.  You got to bring up the briefcase. 
[03:31:00]  I brought presents.  Presents.  So this doesn't actually.  It's actually well written.  Like I know.  Yeah, this doesn't actually have my artwork on it.  We're working on that.  The writing you like.  It's well done.  So that's just all the articles that my buddy wrote.  He actually was, he took the, his name is Freddy Nagar.  Where he took the NBA program at USC and just realized.  He plays basketball?  He does.  NBA program.  You get it?  Hello people.  Is the fucking thing on?  Wake up.  I flew in for this shit. 
[03:31:30]  Give me something, you fuckers.  Actually, he does play basketball.  Exactly.  So he's black then.  No.  Hello.  Again with the joking.  Nothing.  You guys are laughing out there though.  We're just tired because it was a very long show.  These guys puking all over the studio.  Really?  And you did the signing thing?  Or are you going to be doing that?  We have not done the signing.  No, we just flew in now.  We just did the red eye guide in here this morning.  Came over to see you guys.  And where is that going to be?  We're at the Pittman High School in Pittman, New Jersey.  Doesn't sound like a great place, but it's actually pretty cool.  The Pittman High School.  Yeah, we're going to be there Saturday, tomorrow from 2 to 6. 
[03:32:00]  And then Sunday.  Anyone else or just like?  Just the three of us are going to be there.  Yeah, we're going to show the movie and then we have a question and answer.  And then, you know, session and then an autograph session after.  What's the question you're always asked?  Well, obviously the porn question, but.  No.  No, they don't answer that much.  Not really.  How did you get the tongue to stick to the pole?  That's really it.  That's the one.  Did you really have yellow eyes?  Did you?  And then actually Sunday we're going to be in Pottstown, Pennsylvania at a place called  Simply Awesome. 
[03:32:30]  Okay.  So we're going to be there from like 12 to 3.  Well, that's got to be good.  And you've got to ask it to be called Simply Awesome.  It's really a cool place.  Simply Awesome.  Where I live and I have this condo, I call it Amazingly Fantastic Sex.  It's just the name of my place where I live.  So do you want to come back for some Amazingly Fantastic?  It's just the name of the house.  It's nothing about me, guys.  That's fine because I have an apartment called Get Hepatitis.  Nice.  Joe in Jersey.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, I've got a question for Scotty. 
[03:33:00]  Did he go to Bridgewater High School?  Yes.  I want to know if my dad was bullshitting me or not.  My dad said he taught him.  What's your dad's name?  Casper.  Like the ghost, K-A-S-P-E-R.  Of course I know Mr. Casper.  No shit.  All right.  Then he's not bullshitting me.  No.  That's cool.  I just want to know, man.  Thanks a lot.  Absolutely.  You've got to say hi to your dad for me.  Wait, dude.  You do know that your dad would take photos of the students, don't you?  Yes.  If I remember, your dad's first name is Dave.  Dave Casper. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, he's gone.  Small world.  Yeah.  What else we got?  Come on.  Oh, well, we have to give away these tickets really fast.  Tickets to what?  What are we giving away?  Well, here.  Do it.  What are we giving away here?  Let's do it there.  Oh.  The Jägermeister Music Tour.  That's right.  All right.  Win custom tour prizes.  Ticketmaster.  Yada, yada.  BS, BS.  Okay, fine.  They're giving away two tickets.  If you're in the Boston area, that does not mean New Jersey.  That does not mean Connecticut.  Well, that kind of means Connecticut, but Boston would be good. 
[03:34:00]  And you want to see Disturbed at the Avalon tonight or tomorrow night, call in to wear  a pair of VIP tickets.  And you get to meet them also.  Yeah.  You hang out with Disturbed.  It's Disturbed and Corrosion.  Pretty cool.  And if you're a hot chick, you can blow them on the way in and give them your pass.  Sure.  So they would enjoy that.  Absolutely.  And it's the Jägermeister Music Tour.  I always wondered about that.  You know.  What?  How, you know, rockers on the road.  It's like every night.  Absolutely.  And you got these women that, you know, hi, I'm security.  Yeah, blow me.  Here's a pass.  Go have a good time.  Amazing.  And these chicks do it night after night after night. 
[03:34:30]  That's why there's not one person who doesn't want to be a rock star.  Absolutely.  Everyone wants to be a rock star.  No.  Last week we were in Cleveland and we were in a parade and the Grand Marshal was Tom Jones.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  Now that was hot.  And Scotty took off his panties and threw him at Tom Jones.  I threw him at Tom.  It was disgusting.  There was hair all over him.  It was just a stain-o-rama.  Tom Jones is the man.  Oh, no kidding.  It looked like his face was sliding off his skull.  You know, these two were like, yeah, Tom Jones, you know. 
[03:35:00]  As soon as we got there, then they got excited.  Then they got excited when we got there.  I was all up in Santa's lap.  It was great.  I was singing.  I'm like, let's go.  You've got to respect Tom Jones.  Of course.  He's a cool train with his son.  Five decades?  He'd bang chicks with his son.  His son was his manager.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  God bless him.  Oh, yeah.  It's so homo-erotic.  No, it's not bad.  I did the same thing with my father, but it was my mom.  So it kind of killed my mom.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Thanks for coming. 
[03:35:30]  Give me those ribs.  Great.  Well, guys, best of luck.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  And your future ventures.  Any more porn?  Are you leaving that alone?  You know, it's like it doesn't cross with Christmas Story.  It's like, you want to come talk to me in July?  No problem.  I got a little story for you, though.  You guys will like this.  My favorite moment about the porn.  I take Scotty to go see Trainspotting.  Not really one of Scotty's favorite films.  We're walking out of Trainspotting, and I was like, oh, hey, man.  How'd the porn thing go? 
[03:36:00]  He's like, hmm.  It went good.  It went good.  You know, it was annoying and this and that.  She likes her men freshly shorn.  I'm like, freshly shorn.  Shorn.  She likes the ball shade.  She's like, yeah, yeah.  I said, so how'd the money shot go?  He's like, it was rough.  You know, it was a lot of people.  And I go, so did you see the final tape?  And he goes, yeah.  I'm like, what did you think?  He goes, I wish someone had told me about the Razor Bird. 
[03:36:30]  See, nobody told me about Razor Bird.  I don't think about it.  Guys, we don't shave anything but our face.  Scotty's balls, bright fucking red, slap me.  And my ass.  Oh, God.  I'm like, no.  I've never.  See, nobody talks about Razor Bird.  My favorite quote of all time.  I wish someone told me about the Razor Bird.  Guys only shave their face.  We never shave our ass.  So here I am.  You know, and I got another girl shaving my ass in the shower.  And it's great.  Okay, fine.  But nobody says anything.  I go and I shoot the whole thing.  Get it done.  Three weeks later, I see the rough cut.  And I see my ass.  And it looks like a connected dots board.  I'm like, what the hell is this? 
[03:37:00]  So I'm like, what am I?  I'm like, so I called the owner of Wicked in, Steve Warrenstein.  I call him in.  And I'm like, would you like to explain what to me?  I'm like, well, how about somebody like going cut, throw a little makeup, do something,  will you?  Get ILM in there.  Tippi Tom's a little touch it up.  Tippi Tom's a little different than he was earlier in the show.  Oh, he's always hammered.  Nice hammered.  Huh?  Tom is all sober in every story.  All right, you want to get on the stage?  No, Tom, go over there.  Go back there. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, go on the back.  Oh, my goodness.  We got a frozen pole for him?  Golden Buns is back.  Yeah, his name is Golden Buns.  Thank God for my rescue, people.  If you want, we can.  That rescued me.  Tom, have you been drinking?  Well, no.  Yes, you have.  You're drunk now, and you weren't when you came in here.  Well, I don't know.  Somebody bought me a beer.  A beer.  So I drank it.  And yes, and I took a nap in the toilet bowl, and now I'm here. 
[03:38:00]  In the toilet bowl.  Yeah.  Hey, that's my will.  Now, I want to know.  Oh, he's joking.  I want to know something.  Yeah, Tom.  Who's got a beer?  Tom, we got some big stars in the studio here, though.  You didn't even say hi.  You ever see a Christmas story?  Big stars.  Yeah, you ever see the movie Christmas Story?  Show him your razor burn.  Yeah.  If you want him, we can get him to do the old golden buns.  Oh, we got Robert De Niro here.  Robert De Niro.  Very good.  Robert De Niro. 
[03:38:30]  All right, who else we got, Tom?  Al Pacino.  Al Pacino.  We got Robert Redford.  Nice.  There you go.  Nice.  You could do a lot worse.  Not bad.  And you got me.  Yeah.  Golden buns.  But also, it is.  Should we take a look at his golden buns, then?  I think we should, Ope.  I think so, too.  I had to see this man's ass.  Tom, we got big stars in the studio.  I don't want to see his ass again.  I do, man.  I don't want to see him.  But wait a minute. 
[03:39:00]  You want to take a picture?  Yeah.  The guys want to take a picture of your golden buns.  I don't want to.  They're the best buns in the world.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Look at everyone's leaving.  I do.  Come on, man.  I'm on the radio.  You guys taking his pants off, dude.  What kind of studio do you got in here?  It's a disgusting studio.  There's 4,000 porn stars.  There's 4,000 porn stars that I'm sitting next to a homeless man who's going to take out his ass.  Jimmy's negotiating.  Over there.  Over there.  Over there.  How am I going to get the money? 
[03:39:30]  I'm going to get the money.  I'll give it to you.  I'm not going to see it.  All right.  Here we go.  No.  No.  Come on.  Don't cock block, Anthony.  Dude.  Cock block.  I got the money.  This is wrong.  What the fuck, man?  Oh, you got to see his underpants, too.  They're great.  They are delicious, Tom.  He knows golden buns.  I wanted to wait until my father was in his 70s before I had to wipe a grown man.  This is not what I want to see.  This guy hasn't wiped in a decade.  He's...  I'm...  Ah!  There you go.  Golden buns.  And you can't look away. 
[03:40:00]  He has a big bag.  He's slapping his own ass.  Look at his bag.  Look at his bag.  Wait.  Pop, pop.  Look at his bag.  Look at his bag.  You look at his bag.  No, I saw.  Anthony didn't see.  I saw.  Anthony didn't see.  I have seen enough to know I have seen too much.  Nice.  I haven't touched anything, and I'm Purelling.  I lived in San Francisco for four years.  This is nothing new.  I saw this every day on Marcus.  That's because you love the ass.  He's got a racing stripe that's four inches thick. 
[03:40:30]  Whoa!  It goes this high, man.  That's not a happy trail.  That's a rainforest.  Yeah, there's...  All right, Tom.  That's not mine now.  That's beyond a skid mark.  That's the starting line at Englishtown.  You ever been there?  It's built up.  The rubber is...  There it is.  Oh, Englishtown is...  Right.  Oh, that reference is funny now.  Guys, we only got...  We only got two minutes... 
[03:41:00]  We only got two minutes left in the show.  I got to say, I had a Lynn LeMay out there.  My friend Lynn LeMay, who is a porn star.  And she's going into the AVN Hall of Fame, so I told her I was going to say hi because she's  listening.  Very good.  Nice.  I love you, Lynn.  Congratulations.  The big plug, guys, because we're running out of time.  Yeah, where are you guys going to be again?  Pittman High School tomorrow, Saturday from 2 to 6.  Yeah.  And it's in Pittman, New Jersey.  And then in Pottstown, Pennsylvania at Simply Awesome, right off 100.  Yeah, and also, you can also bring out Resident Evil Apocalypse covers if you want to bring  out Titus stuff.  If you want to bring out Almost Famous stuff. 
[03:41:30]  If you want to bring out Freddy vs. Jason stuff.  If you want to bring out Wild America stuff.  Dude, I can keep on going.  Oh, you've been in a lot of things.  I'm a big fucking star.  He's a big star.  You punch him up on IMDb.  A lot of movies come out, man.  My mom says I'm very pretty.  That is very cool.  By the way, Badlands.  Yeah.  Badlands Booker, the new champion.  Yep.  Eggnog drinking champion.  He passed out coal.  Did he?  Outside the studio.  I love his gifts, man.  You gave him dildos and vibrators.  I'm like, we know what to give.  We know what to give.  And we've got to say goodbye to Jimmy for a couple weeks. 
[03:42:00]  Back in two weeks.  And I've got a New Year's Eve gig.  I'm doing the Tower Theater in Philadelphia with Rich Voss and Colin Quinn.  Tickets go on sale December 10th.  Okay.  Nobody likes Golden Mons no more?  And Tippi Tom, where will you be appearing?  What street?  Tippi Tom.  14th and what?  Very unhappy.  14th and 7th.  You treated me with disrespect.  We always respect you, Tom.  Tippi.  We're going to end with you, okay?  You're going to be part of the homeless shopping spree.  That's coming soon to the ONA program.  Why don't you give us a little song as we leave the radio today? 
[03:42:30]  A little song.  What do you want to hear?  A little Christmas song, I guess.  You want to hear some Elton John.  Elton John?  A Christmas song.  Something Christmassy.  Come on.  We're running out of time, Tom.  Chestnuts roasting on...  Hey!  Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.  There we go.  Had a very shiny nose.  And if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows.  That's what shop labor.  That's what it's not that bad.  That's what it's not at Christmas Eve.  Come on. 
[03:43:00]  Sing it.  Program complete. </pre>
