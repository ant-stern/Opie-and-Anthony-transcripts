<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' signature introductions, followed immediately by a graphically described listener account of a strip search. This transitioned abruptly into "Pot Talk Monday" and "Feel Good Story Monday," a stark contrast to the previous segment.  A significant portion was dedicated to mocking a Preston and Steve radio bit celebrating the Phillies' 10,000th loss using 10,000 marbles; Opie and Anthony played clips of the bit, contrasting it with their own far more outrageous stunt ideas.  They also critiqued movie posters, specifically those for "Chuck and Larry" and "I Love Trouble,"  lamenting Kevin James' refusal to be a guest. The show included listener calls contributing to the "We Built This City On…" bit and a discussion about the longevity of the Phillies. Rosie O’Donnell's post-"The View" video blogs, particularly a graphic account of an ingrown hair removal incident, were discussed, and the broadcast ended with criticism of the New York Post's puns.  Jimmy Norton was present in studio throughout.

The next segment started with a humorous anecdote about a woman shushing a man during sex, seguing into a discussion of Lady Bird Johnson's nickname. The hosts then recounted hotel problems in Rochester, NY, focusing on their experience with Murphy beds at a Hyatt. A major part of the show centered on a mentally challenged individual singing the national anthem at Fenway Park, with the hosts and callers debating the crowd's reaction and the appropriateness of the event, using offensive language to describe the singer's performance.  An audio clip was mentioned as being available on their website.  The show also covered a news anchor mispronouncing Hillary Clinton's name (using offensive language in their description),  a New York amputee attacked with his own prosthetic leg (with speculation on the victim's possible provocation),  details of an upcoming comedy show with discounted tickets for military personnel, and extensive, offensive mockery of Paul McCartney's new album cover.  A "Marble Madness Monday" stunt involving marbles rolled down a museum staircase (and its local news coverage), a Comic-Con contest,  a large settlement in a priest sex abuse scandal (with offensive jokes about Cardinal Mahoney), and two 911 calls (one involving a homeowner shooting a burglar, the other a choking death due to operator inaction) were also discussed, with portions of the calls played.  Throughout, numerous offensive terms were used.

A substantial portion focused on several 911 call recordings, beginning with a dispatcher's failure to assist a choking woman, leading to her death.  The hosts played a 911 call of a man shooting his wife, offering nonchalant commentary, and a listener criticized the operator's lack of instruction.  A report and audio were played from a case of a National Guardsman sniper killing his estranged wife while she was singing on stage.  The hosts' analysis included comments on the husband's precision and audacity.  The show then shifted to Tracy, the producer, hiding from the program director, Tom, due to an unauthorized promo about "getting high with K-Rock,"  followed by discussion of Tracy's actions and her subsequent avoidance of Tom. This spiraled into tangents involving Tracy's email suggesting a beach trip, another staffer's sexual drought, and the delayed move to a new Sirius XM studio. A phone call with Elo, regarding the studio delays, offered vague explanations.  The segment concluded with graphic descriptions of Jimmy's bathroom accident involving his hat and the toilet.  Numerous jokes were made at the expense of those involved.

The following segment revolved around a "duty hat" filled with feces and urine, and the negotiation to get intern Jared to put it on his head for $400 (with contributions from a caller).  The detailed negotiation included instructions on minimizing spillage and repeated attempts to get Jared to say “Oh boy, a duty hat!” correctly, hampered by his nervousness.  The segment culminated in Jared putting on the hat, resulting in fecal matter in his hair, and further comedic moments during the cleanup.  The show then returned to the hotel with Murphy beds, with a caller (Dominic) criticizing Kenny, a staff member. Kenny called in to apologize, followed by a discussion of the incident. Finally, a pre-recorded, poorly-received skit by intern Jared, featuring a fictional French author (E-Rock) attempting to seduce a woman (Sam), was played, followed by further discussion of news items, listener calls, and promotion of Jimmy Norton's book signing and upcoming live shows.

The show concluded with wrapping up "Marble Madness Monday," then brainstorming ideas for a Barry Bonds home run record-breaking stunt, starting with Planned Parenthood and escalating to a shockingly offensive joke about throwing fetuses out a window. Studio guest Jimmy Norton briefly discussed upcoming appearances on Spike TV and another show (whose name he forgot). The show ended with promotion of their "$10 ticket Tuesday" comedy tour, directing listeners to their MySpace page.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  How does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Paris, you were strip searched.  Was the search something we like to call the old two-hander?  Whoa.  Damn.  Did they do the old grip and rip?  Where is it going?  What is that?  Um, extreme camel toe.  Ew.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God, you got a complete camel toe.  Opie and Anthony.  If you are here, give us a sign.  Oh, boy.  My wallet is gone. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, my God.  It's with us beyond the grave.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Wakey, wakey.  Here come the words.  Stupid words.  Lots of words.  We have lots of words for you today.  Hopefully some outrageous words.  Words.  Some funny words. 
[00:01:30]  Some informative words.  What other words?  When you stick them all together in a certain way, they're supposed to make sense.  Good luck making sense of it.  They're supposed to make a sentence.  Yes.  Curious.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Monday edition of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes.  Which means we're doing pot talk today. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, it's pot talk Monday.  We're looking for your feel good stories because it's feel good story Monday.  Feel good story Monday.  Has anyone ever contributed a feel good story?  I'm trying to think.  It's not their job.  It's our job?  It's Danny's job for the most part.  I thought it was like the listeners could call in with a feel good story.  From their town or city?  Hey.  See, it's a way to, you know, localize it.  Do you have a feel good story?  You know, it's the weekend happened.  That's why feel good stories on Monday because, you know, maybe some feel good story happened 
[00:02:30]  over the weekend.  All right.  We can take your feel good stories today.  Yeah, why not?  And it's also, we built this city Monday.  It's a new addition to the days of the week drivel.  Well, we, uh, if you're keeping track at home, if you got your scorecard.  Yeah.  Oh, a scorecard.  We are getting rid of sometimes Monday.  Yeah, it didn't really pan out, did it?  And we are adding, we built this city Monday.  I hate we built this city Monday. 
[00:03:00]  And there's some chatter among the Opie and Anthony fans.  A lot of chatter going on.  Chatter.  I hate this stupid bit they're doing with the days of the week.  That means we do it even harder.  Good.  That means we focus on it even more.  So if you're keeping track at home, sometimes Monday is over and we're going to attempt,  we built this city Monday.  Actually, it just started as a gag.  You left early on Friday, Jimmy.  And we got into it.  Did he?  Yeah.  He didn't even know he was here. 
[00:03:30]  Friday?  I don't remember Friday at all.  Oh, it left like a minute earlier, right?  No, we ended up doing like 45 minutes.  Oh, did you?  Yeah, we got crazy.  We actually went late yesterday.  All right.  On Friday.  And we got into a whole discussion on that dumb song, We Built This City.  Weren't you here for that?  Yes.  Were you?  And then you left after that?  Yeah.  Oh, and I'm laughing at Anthony because he didn't remember.  Yeah, I left right before the show ended.  And that wasn't that long.  No, no, no, no.  Well, it was a little while, but I heard this discussion. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm such an idiot.  I kept saying how the song sucked and I hated it.  Yeah.  Okay.  You weren't here, were you?  Yeah.  Oh.  Now I don't know if he was here.  I don't either because Jimmy's a compulsive liar.  No, but I really was here.  Yeah, but no one believes you.  See, you've lied so much now, we don't know if it's true or not.  You were talking about weathermen and how every weatherman in different cities did their  own little local fork.  Or traffic.  Oh, was it traffic?  Whatever it was.  Okay.  Yeah, it was a local traffic report for your city or town. 
[00:04:30]  You're like the little boy that cried, fire, fire, fire.  That's right.  And then he finally had a real fire and the fire department didn't come.  What happened?  He burned to a crisp.  Did he?  To a crisp.  Does that little boy look like an onion with two eyes in the middle of him?  I guess.  Making a Paul McCartney promo mouth.  Where do we begin today?  Our phone number, 877-212-5762.  That's 877-212-5762. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, Philly is a bird from Philly.  We built this city on Preston and Steve.  Oh, see.  That hurts.  See, that's going to hurt.  That words hurt.  Well, that's what we asked the people to do over the weekend.  The bid is we built this city on blank.  And then you call up from Buffalo or Rochester or Cleveland or D.C.  And come up with a funny anecdote.  So the first one we got is bird in Philly.  We built this city on Preston and Steve. 
[00:05:30]  No, you didn't.  Speaking of Philly, congratulations.  The Phillies, 10,000 losses in Major League Baseball.  And that's actually since May.  But it's not really fair because the Phillies have been, what, in the Majors since, I think  they were the first team.  I think they played amongst each other.  I think they were the first team and they had to split it in two and start playing games  together.  They wanted like, aren't they one of the original teams for the most part?  Not counting the ones that have come and gone.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  So they got 10,000 losses over the weekend.  I guess it was a big deal in Philly.  And I was looking, like, the Mets only have like 3,500 losses or 3,700 losses.  But then I was reminded they've only been playing since 1962.  Yeah.  Not around as long.  The Phillies start in like 1845.  Some ridiculous year.  Could it really be a team that's still around?  Like, that just amazes me.  That's why that record's just so stupid, you know, because it looks like the Phillies really  suck.  Although they've only won one World Series in over 100 years. 
[00:06:30]  But, you know, it's a dumb record because all these teams have, you know, started their  franchises at many, many different times.  They've been around since they had the curly mustache.  The curly-ended mustache.  And like, they've been around since what?  No mitts?  No catcher's mitts?  Yeah.  They had to make their own baseballs before the game.  Wacky rules.  You think there were wacky rules? 
[00:07:00]  There had to be wacky rules back then.  Yeah.  No night games.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Dumb stuff like that.  So the Phillies got 10,000 losses over the weekend.  Congratulations.  I'm trying to find the list.  That's why I'm kind of stalling here.  Congratulations, Philly.  Ah, where is it?  Okay, yeah.  The Phillies, yeah, they started playing baseball back in 1883.  Oh, my gosh.  That's why they got 10,000 losses.  Wow.  1883.  Braves in second place.  They started in 1876, before the Phillies, obviously, by, what, seven years? 
[00:07:30]  They got 9,681 losses.  The Cubs, 1876 as well, with 9,425 losses.  And then the Pirates are in fourth place, and the Reds in fifth place.  How did they get around to games?  Huh?  How did they get around to play other teams in other cities?  Trains.  Trains.  Well, they just played kind of locally.  That's why a lot of the first teams were just on the East Coast. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And I mean, on the East Coast, like, you know, Philly, New York.  Because the trains weren't there?  Well, it was the train routes back in the day, yeah.  No Conestoga wagon.  Can you take their Conestoga wagon?  And your Yankees, you know, they've been playing since 1901.  They got 7,138 losses.  And I'm reading this today, like, why am I interested in this?  Who gives a crap? 
[00:08:30]  So the Phillies lost 10,000 games.  Whatever.  What happened?  Poster for, I now pronounce you, Chuck and Larry.  Oh, God.  I was stopped going into the Midtown Tunnel, and on the wall next to me was a big poster of that movie.  What's it called?  Chuck and Larry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got Adam Sandler, and who else is in that?  Kevin James.  And Kevin James.  Who, by the way, blew us off. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Another big star who blew us off.  We were doing him a favor.  Yeah.  The movie looks god-awful, but he seems like a nice guy.  He's a local guy.  We're like, yeah, we'd love to have Kevin James on the show.  We said yes to him.  Next thing, you know, he's a conflict in his schedule, or he had to fly off to this place.  Some dumb excuse.  He is apparently good friends with my pal, Adam Ferrara, and I'll have Adam.  I'll have Adam call him and see what the deal is there.  Well, now that Adam's the new chief on Rescue Me, he's going to start blowing it off. 
[00:09:30]  I know.  Well, yeah, that'll happen.  I'll go over his house and smack him.  Yeah.  Like, bastard.  Wake up.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah, I looked at the poster, and I was stopped there so long, like traffic wasn't moving,  that I started getting really annoyed and angry at that poster, because I was able to  look at every little nuance of it, like Kevin James' mouth opened up, and Adam Sandler's  kind of, ah, ah, face, because Kevin James is holding him like you would carry your bride 
[00:10:00]  over the threshold after you're married.  He's holding Adam Sandler, and Adam Sandler's got this, oh, this, you know, face of resignation  on, and Kevin James has got this, like, mouth.  He's opening his mouth, and I'm looking at every single little detail of this poster getting  more and more angry at how bad it looks.  God awful.  It's like, if you ever go through the video store, and certain covers, cover photos of 
[00:10:30]  a movie just annoy the living crap out of you, oh, there's one with Nick Nolte, and who  the hell's that chick that always gets voted best smile?  Wait a minute, it's Julia Roberts.  Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte.  And the movie is, I love Trouble.  I love Trouble.  Oh, very good.  And I have stared at that.  Find that cover there, E-Rock.  I have stared at that cover and gotten enraged. 
[00:11:00]  I will walk through that and not look for movies I want to look at.  I'll just stare at covers that annoy me.  Why do I do it?  Why do I do it?  It annoys me.  It's those composited photos, too.  Well, you know, no one was in the same room.  They just take and they go, okay, now cross your arms and look over your shoulder and  give a look like, oh, boy, I'm annoyed with you.  And then the other person goes, okay, yeah, there it is.  I cannot go into a video store. 
[00:11:30]  I haven't been in years, but.  That is such an obscure cover to, like, point out.  Dude, it is so annoying.  Look at Nick Nolte's face.  I'll tell you what's awful, too, is the name of it.  I love Trouble.  I love Trouble.  Know what they should do?  Ugh.  Maybe we should Photoshop and redo the cover with the Nick Nolte photo from when he was  arrested.  There you go.  There's a Photoshop project.  And the Julia Roberts after she had her five kids or whatever the hell she's up to. 
[00:12:00]  Just pumping out kids left and right at this point.  T-Roc's got it up on the screen, and I'm getting a flashback.  That'd be a great movie title if it was about an abortion.  Like, I love Trouble, and then Nick Nolte is standing there, like, the abortion doctor  is going to hang her, and he's shrugging his shoulders like, what the heck?  What can I do?  That's what it is.  Those what the heck kind of photos that they take for the video covers.  And someone is saying it's the worst movie ever. 
[00:12:30]  Please pull clips from I Love Trouble.  Here's another one.  Punch Up Milk Money.  Milk Money?  Yes.  Punch Up Milk Money.  I have stared at...  Dude, I'm crazy at the video store.  I have stared at Milk Money and wanted to punch the people in the store.  You realize there's no more video stores, though.  Oh, I don't care.  This is like when I used to go there.  All right.  Maybe there's a few.  It is so annoying.  Ah, yeah!  Yeah.  Who's in that one, here on? 
[00:13:00]  Ed Harris.  Yeah.  It's the kids pushing Ed Harris toward this giant head of, who is that?  Melanie Griffith?  Melanie Griffith, who is so overexposed in the shot, you can't even see that it's her.  But he's pushing like the kids are like, come on, Dad.  Get in a relationship because Mom's dead or something.  It's just...  I stared at these.  Oh, and it's someone's job to come up with these covers for these movies. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Someone is saying, take a look at Crooks.  That's another bad one.  Crooks?  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Jimmy, stop.  That was me.  Jimmy's in there.  Well, well, well, well, well.  Crooks is a film I did.  It's a Jimmy Norton movie.  I'm not in it that much.  What is wrong with me?  It sounded like a real movie.  Yeah, it is.  It's not a good one, though.  It was a film I did called Crooks that was originally called something else, and they had me do a  cover shoot for it, and I did it, but it's like, it's just me on the cover, but I'm only 
[00:14:00]  in it for a few minutes, and I'm like, ugh.  I was thinking that it was some black movie or something.  No.  Like some like...  No.  What a racist you are.  Oh, my God.  Well, yeah, sorry.  Not really, but...  Oh, God.  There's so many.  I just wish I could remember the names.  I'll tell you the ones I hate are Steve Martin and those Cheaper by the Dozen that...  Oh!  Look at his...  Exactly.  ...his snarky face.  Yes.  The Father of the Brides, he's got this half a squint thing he does.  That is exactly the type of cover I'm talking about. 
[00:14:30]  It'll have me standing there and not looking for movies.  Yeah.  I'll just stand there and go, oh, my God, I hate whoever did this.  So getting back to the new Kevin James, Adam Sandler movie, is it getting good reviews?  Can't be.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Chuck and Larry.  I will stand there looking at that.  Get me to Steve Martin.  Look at Adam Sandler's face.  And what, they get married or something for benefits or something, right?  Hey, they're not gay, but they're getting married.  Look out.  There it is.  Stupid by the Dozen.  He's wearing this blue sweater. 
[00:15:00]  Well, it's a dad sweater.  Yeah.  He's just a dad.  So predictable, it's a dad sweater.  And the look on his face, I want to dip my hand in warm crystal oil until it's a bit  of a bubbly lather and then slap his face until his stupid wig falls off.  Steve Martin has a father.  Yeah, right.  Who are you kidding?  Really?  Well.  Just heard things.  Heard things.  On the phone, too. 
[00:15:30]  Come on, it was years ago.  Anyway, so.  Steve is a big XM fan.  He calls into the jazz channel.  What do you get?  Shut up with your jazz.  God forbid we can get him on the phone.  Then again, we've trashed him.  We started like three or four topics already, and it's very early.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Boston.  What's up, Jeff?  Hey, Jeff.  Hey.  Hey.  One of the old baseball rules that I remembered, I was laughing so hard after I heard this, 
[00:16:00]  I couldn't remember some of the other rules.  If you got hit by a pitch, it was a ball.  Oh, really?  Oh, see.  Wacky rule.  You could just go up there and drill the guy four times, and that's the only way he could  get his base.  And they were probably so polite back then, they didn't charge the mound.  No.  That's what they said.  It was part of all the honor back then.  Well, sir.  I do apologize for that, sir.  Well, the baseballs back then were as hard as sponges.  They can only throw like 27 miles an hour. 
[00:16:30]  Of course no one's charging the mound.  Right.  You're not getting a 100-mile fastball at your head back then.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you.  What's that one where Steve Martin's holding them upside down?  You just had a...  Oh, no.  Oh, that one.  He's holding one in each arm upside down.  Oh, yeah.  Parenthood, of course.  You know, the tots have been so bad, he has to hold them upside down.  I gotta hold them upside down.  Oof.  Another movie where he's playing a father.  You're a great actor, Steve. 
[00:17:00]  That'd be a great movie cover.  She got an Academy Award, huh?  If it was Susan Smith holding those two damp little...  Two burdens.  He has two damp interferences.  Hey, two in a row from Boston.  Bill in Boston.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, how's it going this morning?  All right, Bill.  Good.  We built this city on cheap slave labor.  Oh.  See?  They started the bid, Anthony.  I think about Boston or we built this city on massive corruption.  That as well.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you.  We'll see you guys.  Thank you. 
[00:17:30]  We'll see you up in Mansfield.  Saturday is the next ONA Traveling Virus Comedy show.  Is it this Saturday?  Wow.  It's Saturday.  Look at us go.  Wow.  And don't forget, we got that military special, which is huge.  Yep.  You got a military ID.  We are letting you in free this Saturday in Mansfield when we do the comedy tour with,  of course, nine comedians you know and love from the show.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.  And all the info is on VirusTour, one word, on MySpace.  Where is Mansfield?  How far from Boston is that?  It's kind of like Southwest.  Northwest.  Okay.  Far from Boston? 
[00:18:00]  I'm trying to remember because, you know, back when we were up at AF, it was a hike.  It's probably about, what, 45 minutes, I'm thinking, from Boston.  Is it really?  I think.  I haven't been there in a while.  I think I might have to leave after the show Friday and hit a casino on the way up and then  get there Saturday.  There you go.  Might have to do that.  So much for the, so much for your $50,000.  That's been whittled down the last couple of weeks, huh?  Hell no.  Oh.  I've never seen you peel off more hundreds in the last two weeks. 
[00:18:30]  Well, it was for the show, so you're not.  Oh, no kidding.  It's deductible.  But I could tell you were a big winner.  You're just pulling out hundreds like it was nothing.  I had to.  Paying off listeners, bribing them.  I had to pay off the listeners to do wacky things.  Right.  That's what I do now.  My birthday is Thursday.  Oh.  So there's like, I'm going to Chicago, but there's a big birthday celebration at the Mansfield  Tweeter Center.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy.  And it really is his birthday.  It really is his birthday.  Yeah.  They're going to bring me a cake and we're going to break Voss's other arm. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  We're going to have to do something special for you.  How about the whole crowd just sings happy birthday to Jimmy?  Oh, that'll be special.  Oh, nothing too crazy.  I don't want to stand arrested.  Hey, also, don't forget the rest of the cities left on the comedy tour tomorrow, you know,  is two for Tuesday, Rock Scream Tuesday, and also a $10 ticket Tuesday.  $10 ticket Tuesday.  For the rest of the dates on our comedy tour.  Wow.  Tomorrow is the day you can get a $10 ticket.  Keep listening to your local station for all the details, okay? 
[00:19:30]  All right.  Well, we'll take our first break.  We've got lots of great stories today, man.  Oh, yeah.  I know, Stan.  It's brought to you by Bud Light.  Always.  Always worth it.  We're going to tell you what Rosie O'Donnell's been up to since leaving.  The View.  Also, does anyone care?  Is it one of those things where someone cares?  Oh, you'll laugh.  Is she wacky?  She lost her mind?  You'll laugh.  You'll laugh.  I'll do.  Don't you worry.  And then we've got some great, great stories in the news today.  We've got to do a little news today.  Buffalo, you've got a guy getting beaten by his own leg. 
[00:20:00]  You've got the sniper story.  You've got the story where it makes you question God.  Of course.  We've just got lots and lots of stuff to get to, so let's take a quick break, and we'll  be back.  Phone number 877-212-5762.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  What's up, Chicago?  Good morning to everyone listening on WCKG. 
[00:20:30]  Our own little Jimmy Norton's going to be up in Chicago on Wednesday, I believe.  No, Tuesday, actually.  7.30 p.m. at the Borders on North Clark Street.  That's tomorrow I fly.  Oh, okay.  Tomorrow after the show.  I got confused because I know you're not going to be on Wednesday's show, so I'm thinking  you're going to be in Chicago on Wednesday, but you're actually going to be flying home?  Yeah, I thought I was flying on my birthday.  I'm not.  All right, you guys figure that out.  But you'll be at Borders in Chicago on Tuesday night. 
[00:21:00]  Tomorrow night, yeah.  And you'll be doing call-ins with somebody on CKG, hopefully?  Yeah, I might even go in and do Steve Dahl's show by Landon's on.  I want to do his show in person.  I'm sure he would love to have you, Jimmy.  Yes, we have a very good sexual chemistry.  Our phone number, 877-212-5762.  Let's go to Kevin in Philly.  What's up, Kevin?  Hello?  Hey, Kevin.  What do you got today?  Oh, yeah.  I wanted to tell you guys about the hacky radio bit that Preston and Steve did for the Philly 
[00:21:30]  10,000 loss.  Yeah, you know, someone else turned us on to what they did.  We just saw the video on YouTube.  God, it's got to be one of the lamest things I've ever seen in my life.  It really is.  Why don't you explain for everybody?  It's big news in Philly that the Phillies have lost 10,000 games officially.  So the town's been abuzz waiting for this unbelievable moment to happen.  And Preston and Steve decided they needed to roll 10,000 marbles down the stairs. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  At the museum?  Right?  Library.  And I got to tell you, sometimes when you come up with these bits, you're thinking it's going  to be unbelievable.  And then you do it and realize it's happened to us.  And you realize, wow, this was really lame.  They really bombed.  This 10,000 marble spit they did is just so lame.  I'd say 8,000 of them went about three steps and then a few kind of rolled a little further. 
[00:22:30]  I think they were expecting something a little more, I don't know, entertaining to watch.  How about the ONA pass?  Go to YouTube, put in Marble Madness.  Marble Madness.  Marble Madness.  Whoa!  But hold on.  What's mad about it?  Where's the madness part?  There's a guy with a barrel and he dumps marbles.  It's mad, Jimmy.  It's mad.  How about this?  In honor of the Phillies losing 10,000 games, someone call corporate right now and get it done. 
[00:23:00]  We dropped $10,000 from a helicopter.  That's what we do.  That's the bit.  Didn't we want to do that a long time ago?  Yeah, yeah.  They've still been trying to figure out how to keep everybody safe.  We want to go to Philly in a helicopter, $10,000, in honor of the Phillies losing 10,000 games and drop $10,000.  That's the bit.  Not marbles rolling down three steps.  Go to Marble Madness on YouTube, the ONA pass. 
[00:23:30]  Check out the video.  We encourage you to check out the unbelievable video that is Marble Madness.  And leave your comments after you see the video.  Can we have audio of that, please?  Do you have audio of that?  Oh, E-Rock, yes.  Love to hear that.  Yes, let's hear it.  Love to hear it.  Because apparently they're doing a lot of fake, making it bigger than it is.  The problem is, with radio, it used to be, if you were just on the air, you could fake things and make it sound bigger than life.  But once you put it on video like this, people can watch and go, why are they getting so excited? 
[00:24:00]  All right, go ahead.  You guys are great.  I'm looking forward to you coming to Philly.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Looking forward to us coming to Philly.  We were just in Philly.  We're just back.  We will be back, though, before the Twitter Center show.  Yes, in Camden.  Go ahead.  All right, on a count of three, Eric and Todd, are you guys ready?  We're ready.  Let's do this.  One, two, three.  Launch the marbles. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, my God.  That is far more marbles than I expected to come out of the trash can.  In other words, far less marbles.  Out of the 10,000, 10 marbles made it all the way down to the bottom.  Boy, where's Susan Waldman to make the call on that one?  Wow.  Oh, my goodness gracious, the marbles. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, they got to be feeling the pressure because they're...  That stinks.  How awful is that?  Hey, guys, let's do something crazy.  I'm going to roll a bowling ball off the curb.  Who cares?  Can you play the audio again for me?  Oh, hold on, E-Rock.  Hold on.  All right.  Play the audio for me again.  All right.  On a count of three.  Eric and Todd, are you guys ready?  We're ready.  Let's do this.  One, two, three. 
[00:25:30]  Launch the marbles.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  I've made an ass of myself.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed, but I did that.  They have no control over these marbles as they pour down the art museum steps.  Pour down, you idiot.  They're laying on the top eight steps. 
[00:26:00]  Idiocy and stunt them.  Congratulations, Philadelphia.  And way to celebrate the 10,000 awards.  Woo!  Billy!  Here's a little tip to Preston and Steve.  When you come up with a really good idea in your eyes,  you think this is going to be unbelievable.  You're going to have the whole city talking about your 10,000 marbles going downstairs.  And you film the video.  Okay.  And then you get the video back at the station.  You realize, oh, what a dud this was.  You make believe you lost the video.  Right.  And just keep it an audio bit. 
[00:26:30]  Because now everyone could go to YouTube and check out how lame this bit was.  And if they say they did it to be ironic,  that's how they're going to try to spin it.  Like, they did it to be ironic.  Like, yeah, we knew it sucked.  That's why.  No, it's not why you did it.  And the guy's trying to, like, sell.  Like, oh, my God, the marbles are rolling.  They're out of control.  And as he's saying whatever he said,  Yeah.  They're sitting, like, three steps from the top, most of them.  Yeah, 99% of the marbles were on the first, like, five steps.  And then you heard a couple just going, 
[00:27:00]  tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  What he said was, that was a hell of a lot more marbles than I expected to come out of there.  Well, if there were 10,000 marbles in the enormous can,  I would expect 10,000 marbles, you douche.  Apparently 10,004 came out and he counted them.  He counted them quickly and he just got too crazy.  Like Rain Man.  It was Marble Madness.  So if they put 10,004 marbles in there, it would have been insanity.  Hey, I think we got to start Marble Madness Monday.  Marble Madness Monday.  It's a lot of M's. 
[00:27:30]  I like it, though.  What can we do with marbles?  How about we eat them and then, like, we shoot them out at each other?  Yes.  About four hours later?  Preston and Steve should have done something else.  But, like, Preston should have done something that left 10,000 tadpoles on Steve's chin.  How lame.  See, that's just...  See, in this day and age, you know, radio shows are filming their bits all the time.  Here's the deal. 
[00:28:00]  And it's happened to us.  You know, we have a dud from time to time.  We're not, like, running to YouTube or Break.com and making sure everyone sees our dud.  No.  This is a lame, lame radio promotion.  It might have sounded kind of cool on the radio because you hear 10,000 marbles, you know, falling down one step.  Let me think.  Like, 100,000 out of the back of a dump truck might have been impressive.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  10,000 out of a garbage pail. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, but it has to be 10,000 something because it's 10,000 less.  Yeah, I know.  Billy.  Well, then figure it out.  10,000 larger things out of the back of a dump truck.  Yeah.  10,000 larger ones.  Hey, so the One Pest, I'd appreciate it if you attack Marble Madness on YouTube.  Oh, if you think it's impressive, then write a comment that you think it's impressive, but I'm feeling pretty good about this one.  Yeah.  I don't think our listeners are going to find this impressive whatsoever.  The worst part about it is someone actually was on marble sweep-up duty, and they had to just sweep those dumb marbles down the steps into some, like, you know, area so they could be all scooped up. 
[00:29:00]  Scoop them up because if one marble's left on the stair and someone slips, it could be tragedy.  I've had enough of those rocky steps, by the way.  I'd like to take a flaming dump truck and just explode it into those dumb steps.  I'm tired of them being filmed.  We get it.  He ran up from the low.  Dun, dun, dun.  He's wonderful.  There's steps.  The children followed him.  When Stephen Hawking walks up those steps, then I want to see them filmed. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  Then that would be impressive.  Roll him down the steps.  That's impressive.  Physicist madness.  He blows into a stupid tube, says something an hour later, and tumbles down one-step.  Physicist madness.  They just tip his chair forward, and his glasses are askew.  That's why he says something brilliant on the way down.  By the way, Marble Madness, they had a camera set up about 10 to 12 stairs down. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  And they were hoping to get the shot with all the marbles just out of control, flying  by the camera.  Yeah.  And I'm looking.  There's about, honestly, maybe 10 to 12 marbles that made it down to the other camera.  Didn't make it down as far as they thought.  I know the shot they were looking for, all these marbles just coming by like a landslide  or something.  Yeah.  Like a tsunami of marbles.  Right.  People freaking out, running away.  Ah!  It's marbles, and it's madness! 
[00:30:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah, he thought it was going to be like a scene out of Hitchcock's The Birds, that people  were just going to be running with the marbles in their hair.  Fruits.  And by the way, that's right, we're pointing out how lame they are.  Yeah, come on.  This is some lame-ass radio.  That's your number one show.  Wow.  There it is.  I don't know if we can compete with Marble Madness.  There it is, Philly.  You've chosen Marble Madness as the show you want to tune into every morning.  Marble effing madness is the show. 
[00:31:00]  You go, I gotta hear this.  I gotta hear Marble Madness.  Philly, you tune in in droves to see marbles go down three steps.  Three steps.  And start collecting.  That's what you consider.  Again, we've said it before.  Ask somebody that you know if they listen to Preston and Steve.  If they say yes, just point and laugh at them.  And now you can even point and go, look, Marble Madness. 
[00:31:30]  Marble Madness.  Wow, that's a hell of a show.  And they didn't do it to be ironic.  Don't let them get out of this awful bit by saying, no, we knew.  No, you didn't.  No, it's horrible.  And there's their stupid stunt boy, whatever.  I'm sure that guy that was doing the reporting is some kind of stunt boy.  20 people working there.  He's trying to sell it, but the sad part about it is there's a video.  There's a video.  You can't sell it on this video.  Here, play what he said again there.  I can't get enough of Marble Madness.  It's all about Marble Madness. 
[00:32:00]  Dude, what else is that?  Marble Madness is another video cover that I can't stop looking at.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like some guy standing in the middle of a bunch of marbles with his hands above his head.  Hands up, gone, huh?  What is one to do?  Hey, we're mad with marbles.  All right, here he goes.  That is far more marble than I expected to come out of the trash can.  A lot of money is waiting for the room, trying to contain all of them. 
[00:32:30]  They have no control over these marbles.  All right, as he says they have no control over these marbles, all the marbles have stopped rolling.  There is zero kinetic energy left in the marbles.  We have no control over the marbles, and it's a close-up of the marbles.  Oh, here come the marbles down the stairs.  Oh, get out of the way.  Oh, this is the worst catastrophe I've ever seen.  I can't stop this marble setting.  People, get out of the way.  Get out of the way.  Oh, the humanity.  And here's the sound of the marbles as he's saying that. 
[00:33:00]  They have stopped moving.  He had no control.  He had control.  Oh, we don't have control of the marbles.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, go back to that part.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Pause.  What?  And spilled where? 
[00:33:30]  Into the Ben Franklin Parkway.  Most of the marbles stopped after four or five steps.  Only 12 made it about ten steps, which is not even close to the bottom.  Unless that's only true if the Ben Franklin Parkway is the top step.  Then they did flood it.  Hacks!  Preston and Steve are hacks!  See for yourself, ladies and gentlemen.  Go to YouTube and put in Marble Madness and leave your comments.  Yeah, that's what Philly has chosen.  Hack radio at its best. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, they finally got caught for doing hacky crap.  Oh, believe me, we will keep pointing it out.  Yeah, play the rest of that before we take a break here.  Brooms trying to contain all of them.  They have no control over these marbles.  No control as we're looking at marbles not moving.  Now building to the Ben Franklin Parkway, we have achieved idiocy in stuntum.  Congratulations, Philadelphia.  And way to celebrate the 10,000 losses.  Woo!  Philly! 
[00:34:30]  Oh, the final little pan over the stairs is classic.  There were three people on the stairs and not a marble to be found.  We go back and see the last thing.  I want to see the part.  Stop right there.  All right, they panned down the stairs.  Now, if we were going to do any type of bit like this out and about,  there would probably be close to 1,000 listeners there.  I count two.  Wait.  Because this guy works for the station.  That guy works for the station.  That guy works for the station. 
[00:35:00]  I think these two people might be listeners.  Might be listeners.  I don't see a marble.  That parkway has got to be 25 yards from the bottom step.  You couldn't throw a marble and hit the parkway.  You can't say it's spilling into the parkway when you have video that proves that they're nowhere near the parkway.  Oh, please go to Marble Madness on YouTube to see how lame these guys are.  Lame!  Did he say that?  He said the MMR army is trying to contain the marbles. 
[00:35:30]  Are you kidding?  Please tell me he didn't say that.  He did not say that.  He just stutters.  He meant to say army.  I couldn't understand what he said.  Dude, I count maybe a dozen people at this stunt, and most of them work for the radio station.  Because you see banners, you see people with cameras, you see microphones, you see banners.  Jesus.  Where are the people, man?  That is far more marble than I expected to come out of the station.  MMR me. 
[00:36:00]  It's MMR me.  They have no control over these marbles as they pour down the art museum steps and now spill into the Ben Franklin Parkway.  We have achieved idiocy in stuntum.  Congratulations, Philadelphia, and way to celebrate the 10,000 losses.  Woo!  Billy!  I love the two guys with the garbage can.  They realize how lame the bit is.  They're the only ones that realize that the bit is really, really lame.  Oh.  That the marbles didn't go anywhere.  Listen to me.  You idiots.  It's Super Bowls if you're going to do the bit. 
[00:36:30]  Exactly.  10,000 Super Bowls.  Super Bowls have bounce ability.  All the way down the stairs into the parkway.  And it would be a lot more than a half of garbage.  But you weren't allowed to use Super Bowls, were you?  I bet not.  When you have two guys dumping 10,000 of anything, it can't be good.  No.  It can't be big or big enough to get splashed.  For two guys to do it?  Exactly.  How about 10,000 firecrackers or 10,000 M80s in front of a school?  Cherry bombs.  So they roll.  I got a new obsession.  Marble Madness. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Marble Madness Monday.  I'm going to just be watching that over and over again.  I love that last little tan.  They go from the two guys holding the garbage pail that was half full of marbles.  And then they go 180 with the camera to show the stairs.  Yeah.  And there's three people standing on them and not a marble to be seen.  They all stopped within the first five steps.  And I don't have a problem with the two guys next to the garbage can because they realize how lame this is.  And you can kind of read their minds.  They're like, wow, maybe we should try this again. 
[00:37:30]  Maybe we should go back to the drawing board on this.  There you go.  Check it out for yourself.  We encourage you to see the lame radio at its best.  Marble Madness on YouTube.  See what has just turned Philly on its head.  See what Philly is tuning in in droves to see and hear.  Congrats, Philly.  It's the MM Army.  The MM Army.  How can we compete with that?  How can we compete with that, Jimmy?  I don't know.  How about, Eric, we throw you down the steps and say we're going to roll 10,000 pounds. 
[00:38:00]  Sorry.  That's a little weird.  Not that fat.  Yeah.  And you know what?  See, look.  Look, he's just Joe Listener, but he knows how to do the bit better than a radio show.  Go ahead, Joe Listener, also known as Chris from the Poconos.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  Wouldn't baseball have been the bit?  10,000 baseballs.  Baseball.  Of course.  That would have been it.  It looked a lot more impressive because they're bigger than marbles.  Right. 
[00:38:30]  And they would have rolled further.  Right.  A little more weight to them.  They don't get stuck in the little cracks of the stairs like the marbles did.  Well, because they can't commit.  They were keeping it safe.  Keeping it safe.  Baseballs would be just an out-of-control mess.  Would be.  So they chose something that's maybe slightly better than rolling 10,000 sponges down a  staircase.  A staircase.  Sponges.  I would have loved to have been in on that meeting.  What can we do?  10,000, 10,000 games.  What should we do? 
[00:39:00]  Something.  Maybe we can.  Something with marbles.  Yeah, marbles.  Get up and walk out of that meeting in a second.  Well, there you go.  Check it out for yourself.  It is Marble Madness Monday.  Wow.  I don't know how we compete with that.  Hey, Rosie O'Donnell.  This is quick.  Just before the break left the view.  A lot of people wondering what she's up to since then.  Well, she's doing her video blogs.  Video blogs she does now.  Yeah.  She throws anything on video and all these soccer moms just eat it up. 
[00:39:30]  Well, she can't stand to be away from the limelight or the public eye for any length of time.  Right.  So when she got the boot from the view over there, she's got to do these video blogs.  Right.  And you're right.  The housewives that still love her, that don't believe or know that she's a lesbian because  they would freak out, middle America, don't know she's insane.  In my opinion, when you listen to her, she comes off as an insane person. 
[00:40:00]  Uh, she puts out these video blogs and just babbles about conspiracies and all kinds of stuff.  Trump, she's still off on Trump.  Oh boy, you're way off.  What is she doing now?  I hope you're not eating.  Oh no.  She's going to gross everybody out.  Yesterday in the talkie blog, you talked about, I don't even want to say it.  What is it called?  The talkie blog?  Talkie blog.  Is that what she calls it?  Oh God.  The talkie blog?  It should be a fatty blog.  It's a talkie blog. 
[00:40:30]  Talkie blog.  I'm blogging and talking at the same time.  I call it a talkie blog.  Right, that's what I'm getting at.  Brian Regan.  It's a walkie talkie.  I'm walkie in and talkie in.  It's a rooty tootie aim and shootie.  Right.  There you go.  That's the bit.  It's a talkie blog?  Talkie blog.  Ugh.  Yesterday in the talkie blog, you talked about, I don't even want to say it.  Say it, say it.  It actually had like a physical reaction.  A little barfing.  Like a, oh my God. 
[00:41:00]  You picked out an ingrown hair from your face with a thumbtack?  Is this needed for a talkie blog?  This is what it's come down to.  Is this what a talkie blog is for?  Did you get just a little puke in your throat?  Yeah.  Hearing that?  Just a visual?  Right?  Just a visual of her picking like an ingrown with a thumbtack out of her face?  Yeah.  I got that with the name talkie blog. 
[00:41:30]  The thumbtack?  Yes.  We need to talk about this.  Okay.  I'll tell you what happens.  It's not good.  Let me just tell you what happens.  It's looking better.  Yeah, look.  See?  Oh my God.  All right.  Here's what I did.  Have you ever seen those razor blades that they use to do your eyebrows sometimes real quick?  Makeup artists.  Have you ever seen those?  It freaks me out.  But yeah, they have threads.  Yeah, like the little razor and you just, it's a tiny little thing that, and so I thought,  God, there is an ingrown hair there and I got the tweezers and nothing.  So I thought, well, I'll just make a little opening with that razor blade. 
[00:42:00]  Oh my God.  Here it is.  Look.  No!  It looks like a herpes, but it's not.  Oh, she's out of stuff to talk about.  She's done.  You think?  Yeah.  It's gotten down to that.  She's on her talkie blog talking about ingrown hairs in her face.  What is it?  A beard?  It's probably a beard growing in.  Who knows?  By the way, I've got a lot of reports coming from Philly.  Marble Madness doesn't work on YouTube. 
[00:42:30]  It's called Preston and Steve.  Leave 10,000 marbles for the Phillies.  Spread the word.  Spread the word.  And make sure you leave your comments on how unbelievable this stunt was.  Yeah, judge for yourself.  Leave an honest assessment.  Right.  Hey, really fast.  Want to spend the weekend at Comic Con in San Diego with Sam?  Our own Sam?  Are you crazy?

Keep listening to your local station for all the details, okay?  Hey, we noticed that the New York Post here in New York is stupid.  Well, their headlines today, really, really bad. 
[00:45:00]  I mean, we pick up on this from time to time.  They've got to have a cute headline for their stories.  But we just compiled a whole list of headlines that they're doing today in today's paper.  I don't think I have mine.  You're right.  Did I get a list?  Oh, thank you.  I like having a worksheet.  Well, Thane is passing out the worksheet.  This is from one...  One newspaper.  Newspaper on one day, just today. 
[00:45:30]  And we didn't even go through the whole paper.  We gave up after, I think, like 10 of these?  These are 10.  They're so clever.  Go through them.  Well, there's, let's say, there's Alan Hevesy, who's one of the politicians around here in New York.  There's some missing documents.  Yeah.  And they have heavy lifting, H-E-V-I, because Hevesy, heavy lifting. 
[00:46:00]  My favorite, though, of the day was Spielberg apparently owns a stolen Rockwell painting.  And the headline was, Raider of the Lost Art.  Can you, like, are they just chuckling in the back rooms there at the post going, I got a good one?  Yeah.  Man stabbed last year is recovering.  And it says, subway victim on track. 
[00:46:30]  How lame.  Rapper Remy Ma.  Has, uh, has at someone before.  I guess apparently some assault charges before this latest thing.  It says, Diva is no one hit wonder.  So, he's hitting someone before. 
[00:47:00]  It's all wordplay.  Yes, it is.  Every single yes.  How do you take a paper seriously?  Oh, I love the post.  Oh, do you?  I do.  Water outages in Hoboken?  Uh-huh.  More H2 woes in New Jersey.  Wait, I don't get that one.  H2 woe.  See?  Oh, instead of H2O.  H2O.  More H2 woes.  Oh, God.  How bad is this? 
[00:47:30]  Crap.  This is like vaudeville.  It's so awful.  And this is from one paper.  Just today's paper.  Who wrote the headlines?  Henny Youngman from the grave?  Henny.  This is Henny Youngman type stuff.  Uh, this guy says he's being fired from his job just for being Jewish.  And, uh, the headline, Brooklyn Man's Suit.  Jet Blue'd Shoe Jew.  Jet Blue Shoe Jew.  Shoe.  Shoe Jew. 
[00:48:00]  Get away, Jew.  Get away, Jew.  Shoe.  Shoe.  I'm Jet Blue.  Shoe Jew.  God, I wish it was that easy.  Oh.  Hey, now.  Oh, it's just a joke.  They're my neighbors.  The people in Jet Blue, you know the shoe when you take both of your hands like you're being  a fairy to go, get away, get away.  Shoe.  Shoe.  Shoe.  Apparently he, uh, can't work on Saturday.  And, uh, they need him to work on Saturday.  So they gave him the boot.  Uh, Jet Blue told you to fly away. 
[00:48:30]  It's awful.  Well, there's a couple more.  Yes, of course.  A few boaters out there having a little, uh, party, a little time on their boat.  Uh, spot a dead body in the river.  And, uh, it says, party guest a stiff.  What?  But that, that party guest wasn't part of their party.  No, it was not that hanging out.  They just came upon a dead body.  Uh, and this is about the rides being, uh, sold at Coney Island.  Yeah.  It says, Coney, bye land. 
[00:49:00]  B-Y-E.  Like, bye.  Ooh.  And this one you might have read about, uh, man swims in North Pole.  First guy ever to, uh, swim in the North Pole.  Uh, brrr, brave man's polar plunge.  Because, see, it's cold.  Brrr, they put a bunch of R's in there.  A brrr, brave man's polar plunge.  See, because it's cold.  Get it?  Get it?  I wonder why there's two hours.  He's freezing.  A lot of R's because it's cold.  What do you think? 
[00:49:30]  They hit the R and it went, hey, and it's stuck and they couldn't find the backspace.  See, because when you're cold, you can't say B-R words without adding a lot of R's.  Oh.  A lot of R's.  What is the...  Oh, I get it.  All right, now good news.  Now the comments are working on that video on YouTube.  Oh, goody.  Thank you, Dolores Berry from Long Island.  Ride the killed woman to be shut down.  And it says ride is over.  They missed one, too.  Yeah, you get the ride is over.  What do you mean?  What did they miss?  You found another one, really? 
[00:50:00]  I'm going to tell you, Harry's Phoenix flies high at box office.  Ah, I get it.  Flies high, Phoenix.  And this one I just thought was tasteless about Lady Bird Johnson.  Yes.  Lady Bird flies into a pine box.  I didn't even know she was still alive.  Who did?  94 years old.  Lady Bird.  She is.  Is that her name?  Is that really her name?  What the hell was her name?  She was named by whoever gave her, she was named after a flower, actually. 
[00:50:30]  A lady bird is a flower.  And I think whoever, when she was born, said she looked like a little lady bird.  Stop it.  She looked so pretty.  Stop it.  That's true.  Stop it.  Okay.  I don't believe Jimmy.  I don't either.  Jimmy gets compulsive liar Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  For Jimmy.  Yeah, I don't even.  You just like to lie to us because it's fun.  It would have been great during the Fat Nick trial if they did some funny words.  It's Fat Nick gives black guy, but instead of black guy, it's black G-Y.  Black guy.  You know, something.  Fat Nick was in the paper over the weekend. 
[00:51:00]  Yes.  Jailhouse photos of him hanging with the homies.  With his black buddies in prison.  Proving that he's not racist.  They love him in jail.  They absolutely love Fat Nick in jail.  Because he hit a guy with a bat.  They respect that.  He's convinced that he's going to be let out on appeal.  It's just disgusting.  Her name was Claudia.  What?  Claudia Johnson.  What, what, what, what?  Oh, really?  Yeah, Lady Bird.  I didn't know that.  So, E-Rock, why Lady Bird?  Look it up.  The reason I said, I thought that was her name, but the reason I said is where she got 
[00:51:30]  the nickname from.  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  She, uh, she was really, uh, just awful looking.  Really.  She was awful looking when, when, when, when LBJ was being sworn in, she looked old and  un-effable.  So how the hell?  God, you make a good point.  Man, I, I watched the old video of people, what, what have you, and they look old.  Yeah.  And it's like 30 years ago, 40 years ago.  And then you, you know, you're reading the paper that they died over the weekend. 
[00:52:00]  You're like, what?  Who the hell was alive?  That person was still alive?  Still kicking.  Lady Bird.  I think all the presidents you've had in between Johnson and, uh, and now.  She was 94.  94.  94 years young.  Years young.  94 years young.  God bless her.  Tired of that, uh, what they call natural causes.  Yeah.  Yeah, someone got sick of taking care of her.  The old pinch-a-roo on the nose.  The old pinch-a-roo.  It's, it's called the old inheritance quicker upper. 
[00:52:30]  The old, the old pinch-a-roo.  You gently cup the mouth, and you take the, the, your pointer finger and thumb.  Yes.  And you, and you give the old pinch-a-roo.  Pinch-a-roo.  You might get a little mucus on your fingers.  That's all right.  But it's worth it.  You do it with a cloth, and you hear.  Oh my God.  Do you have to say shh?  Yeah, that's creepy.  Anytime anyone's killing someone, and they go.  It's really funny until he gets to the shh, shh, shh part. 
[00:53:00]  Anytime there's any human contact, and shh, shh is never good.  Shh, shh, shh.  Yeah.  It's usually a knife to your neck.  There's no situation where shh is going to help achieve someone going over the edge.  Or, well, how about this?  How about this?  You're staring down at a nice woman, and she goes, I want to give you the best.  And you go, well, I don't think you should, shh.  And she goes, shh, shh, zip. 
[00:53:30]  That's good.  I want to, I want to, shh is used in libraries.  And then you go, but I don't think we should, shh, shh.  No, you don't, you don't even give her a chance to do that.  When she goes, I don't want to, you shush it yourself.  I don't, oh.  No, you would be saying something.  She wants to do it.  Oh.  And the guy is like, like kind of maybe married or something.  He goes, I really don't think we should, and she just goes, shh, and zip. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  See, she's shushing you, like shut up.  I don't care.  You don't think this is good, or you want this, or there's a problem.  Like she's like, I really want to make you feel good.  Oh.  I don't know.  I don't.  I just got test results.  Shh.  Shh.  Let's go to Michelle in Queens.  Hey, Michelle, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Love the show.  Thank you, Michelle.  Just wanted to say that Jimmy was right.  Lady Bird Johnson's nanny said she was pretty as a lady bird.  That's how she got her nickname.  And a lady bird is a flower?  I have no idea. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, what is a lady bird?  I got no idea.  We don't think it's an actual.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Though she was named for a mother's brother, Claude, during her infancy, her nursemaid,  Alice.  Alice Tittle.  Alice Tittle.  How can you not say her last name?  Alice Tittle.  What a boob.  God.  Of course.  Commented she was as pretty as a lady bird.  What a retard.  And that nickname virtually replaced her given name for the rest of her life. 
[00:55:00]  Her father and siblings called her Lady, though her husband called her Bird.  All right, click on Lady Bird, because what is Lady Bird?  What is it?  Yeah, there's a link right there.  Right there.  Hey, jackass.  There's a link right in the text.  No, you idiot, E-Rock.  All right.  Well, what is a lady bird?  I see insects.  It's a lady bug?  It's a lady bug?  Oh, is it?  No.  She was as purdy as a lady bug?  Lady bird and lady bird.  That's a lady bug. 
[00:55:30]  What happened when you clicked the link that said that's where it went?  It's a flower.  It's a lady.  All right.  I didn't lie.  I just am proud.  All right.  No.  We need to know what a lady bird is.  It might be a lady bug.  It's something in the garden.  Yeah.  Hey, uh...  LBJ only called her Bird when she was standing on the hood of the car and go to the bathroom on  the windshield.  She was insane.  Jimmy, how...  You're a fair bird.  Jimmy, how was Buffalo?  It was great, actually.  I enjoyed it.  I was there in and out very quickly, unfortunately.  Yeah.  They were good to you up there?  Yes.  And then we got to Rochester.  We had major hotel problems. 
[00:56:00]  Just an abomination.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  No all-night room service for Jimmy?  No.  We stayed at a Hyatt in Rochester, and they put us in a room with Murphy beds.  Murphy beds?  Wait.  What is Murphy beds again?  They come out of the wall, right?  Yeah, it feels like Charlie Chaplin used those.  Where's Kenny?  Is he here?  What hotel still has Murphy beds?  Apparently, the Hyatt in Rochester, you think it's a highfalutin' hotel.  Murphy beds?  What the hell?  It's like you're shacking up.  You're on the lam. 
[00:56:30]  Why would a hotel ever have Murphy beds, by the way?  It's the worst thing.  We get there, and we're supposed to go up and have our rooms, and they're like, well,  we couldn't hold the rooms that you asked for, because, you know, whatever.  So we go up to our rooms, and I walk in, and I'm like, that's a low bed, and I realize  it's been opened from the wall.  And they called them real quick.  The guy goes, this snarky night manager goes, well, the parlor room, and you don't think  the parlor in a suite is the room that you take the fat girl in?  You have your bedroom, and you have the other room with the table. 
[00:57:00]  The parlor room.  That's the living room of a suite that has a fold-out Murphy bed.  So it's like, that's what it was.  You were staying in a suite living room with a fold-out bed, and we were livid, and we're  like, who has Murphy beds anymore?  Well, in New York City, you need Murphy beds, because the apartments are so small.  But a hotel, why would you ever need a Murphy bed?  In a Hyatt.  That's supposed to be like a Hyatt.  Yeah.  And the guy was, he immediately put me in a handicapped room with a regular king, and 
[00:57:30]  he goes, look, I'll comp both the rooms.  And the next day, he didn't comp Kenny's room.  Oh, poor Kenny.  Yeah, really awful.  Kenny, I'm sure, will have something to say about it.  Were his feet hanging over the end of the Murphy bed?  You should have seen him when he opened it, because I was there when he opened it.  He just tipped it out and then let it drop.  I thought it was going to fall through the ceiling after the next person.  By the way, I was asking, how was Buffalo?  Because I didn't really care about the answer.  I was trying to set up a news story coming out of Buffalo.  Oh, it's a story, because Buffalo was...  I didn't really care.  No, I do care about Buffalo.  It was good. 
[00:58:00]  Everyone listening on The Edge, what's up?  They're very, very cool to us up there.  They were very happy.  Jim, the PD came down, and some of the jocks came down in Rochester.  They were both very supportive of the show.  It was nice.  Very nice.  This is, I think Buffalo might have story of the day.  Yeah.  Buffalo might have the story of the day.  Although, you know, well, this is what was written for me, so please don't get all mad  at me.  Retard sings national anthem at Fenway Park, gets nervous, and what do you think the crowd 
[00:58:30]  did?  And when I read the story, I'm like, Boston?  Oh my God, they must have started booing and throwing stuff.  That's what I thought, booed.  But Boston behaved, and the crowd helped the little fella out.  Aw, Boston.  That's adorable.  Actually, now I got to-  I thought he was the mayor.  Huh?  Now I got to play it.  Very good.  Now we got to play this, because we referred to it.  And then we'll get to the Buffalo story, which could be story of the day.  We have the audio, obviously.  Of Fenway?  Yeah.  I do believe we do, yes.  Now is this, who, any background on this crooner, this young crooner? 
[00:59:00]  Um, yeah.  Besides being mentally challenged?  Yeah, he's slow.  Handy capable?  Handy capable.  Slow?  What type of mental retardation were we looking at here?  Can you tell?  Hold on, here we go.  Is it the old DS?  What does he got there?  No, he didn't have, he didn't have that.  None of the downs?  Yeah, it was just a regular one, I guess.  Like just regular?  Regular.  Oh my God.  Sorry to interrupt it. 
[00:59:30]  I don't even know how I say this on the air, but maybe we can put this video up on our  website.  Ken and Jersey from Point Pleasant.  This morning on Channel 7 News, that would be here in New York, around 639, the anchor  called Hillary Clinton.  Hillary.  How about this?  How about this?  I got it.  How about this?  Take out the L.I.  And add a U.  She called her what she is.  Done.  Wow.  It would be like calling Bill Clinton, Bill President-en. 
[01:00:00]  See if that's true, Danny.  And then the co-anchor commented that there would be a meeting about it later today.  I got a good laugh out of it.  Maybe something you guys could use.  Wow.  Where is that?  Pull that audio.  So Danny's trying to find out if it's true.  Here's the Fenway audio.  Oh, we were going to get the answer from Danny.  What did he say?  He just ran out to do another job.  He said just a normal one.  Slow guy.  Slow guy.  Like slow guy.  All right.  Can you see by the dawn's early light? 
[01:00:30]  Why would they do this?  Oh, my God.  Why would they do this?  I understand you want people to feel good and be involved and lead normal lives like that,  but you're just setting up.  You don't know which way this is going to go.  As an organizer, they're saying this is a great idea.  You don't know which way this is going to go.  This could have been tragic if the fans in Boston were half as scummy as they usually are. 
[01:01:00]  Do you understand that Michael Bolton had to write the lyrics down?  Michael Bolton.  Yeah.  He sings a lot in front of people.  Yeah.  A couple things.  Mike in Boston.  I am so glad Mike is saying this today.  He's a hardcore Red Sox fan.  He writes, Opie, Fenway Park no longer represents Boston.  It's more of a social hangout now than it is for Sox fans.  It's a bunch of chicks in pink hats and families.  Guy nailed it. 
[01:01:30]  Last time I went to a Red Sox game, I'm like, what's up with all the pink freaking Red Sox hats?  They started that trend up there.  Glad you won the series because that's what it's all about, my friends.  That's what happens when they win the series.  It's all over.  Now you get all the other Johnny Come Lately fans and their chicks and the pink hats and  all that stuff goes along with being the champs.  Right, right.  Glad you finally did it.  They started that trend and now every ballpark in America has the females wearing the pink  hat. 
[01:02:00]  Oh my God.  He does look like him.  He looks like what?  Look at the video.  I noticed they couldn't find a hat for the little fella.  You make your own joke at home.  You see a waiting pool with two red socks nailed to it.  Here's stupid.  Put this on.  You get home from the Red Sox game and your wife's like or girlfriend goes, well, I didn't  know it was a doubleheader today.  No, it wasn't a doubleheader.  It took an hour to get the game going.  Oh no, no.  She just meant the size of his skull. 
[01:02:30]  And you know what?  We'll get yelled at for making fun of him, yet we didn't put him in front of 60,000 people  and let him sing.  What are we supposed to do?  Of course.  It was a waterheader.  All right.  So far, so good with this guy.  A little off key, but by the way, the video's up on our website.  Well, bottom of the 7th, the Red Sox are down. 
[01:03:00]  So far, so good.  Oh my God.  What the hell was that?  Wait a minute.  Is he laughing?  I see a woman signing next to him.  Is he retarded or is he deaf? 
[01:03:30]  He wouldn't be deaf.  No, maybe.  She can't sign like that and he's staying kind of with the, you know.  Maybe they want the deaf to enjoy too.  Maybe.  Yeah, that's probably it.  Oh.  What?  What's up, Than?  No.  What, Than?  What do you got?  What happened?  What happened?  Than had some insight.  Well, it's Disability Awareness Day, so.  Oh, okay.  You needed somebody to sign for those that are hearing disabled.  How about wheeling a guy up in a wheelchair that can sing?  Exactly.  Something like that.  Exactly.  Get some crippled crooner and let him belt it out. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  How disabled do they want to get?  How about a guy with no mouth?  Let him just blow it out through his nasal passages.  Have amputees play the basses for the day.  With the drums.  That old gag.  You play the drums at your stumps.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Oh.  Oh.  People love giggling retards. 
[01:04:30]  They just love them.  All right.  Hold on.  Cigars and Scotch.  Now they've encouraged them.  Yeah.  Cigars and Scotch.  What's up?  Hey.  He made it all.  He made it all about himself.  Ooze broad tongue and not so bright stars.  Oh.  Oh.  Look.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for that.  I was only joking.  It was broad tongue. 
[01:05:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Did you see that jerk?  Here's your feel good story of the day. 
[01:05:30]  Feel good Monday.  The crowd helps the little fella out.  That's right.  I don't think they're helping him out.  I think they're upset that he's making a mockery of the song.  And they want the game to begin.  And they want the game to begin.  They don't want this, you know, kid to make it all about himself because he got a laugh  by going, ah, ah, ah, ah, and then he decided he was going to do it the whole goddamn song.  You ever do something like stupid kids running around the house and you throw a ball or something at them like you do with a dog or whatever, 
[01:06:00]  and they think now you've got to play with him for like 10 hours?  That's what he was doing.  Like he chuckled and everyone laughed and then he's just going to do it all day.  So those people were not helping him out.  They wanted the game to start.  I think they were helping.  No.  I think they were just, he realized he was flushing.  I have faith in my buddies in Boston.  They're spinning in a circle and drooling.  They're like, let's just help this person.  I think Boston finally showed they have a heart.  They finally showed it. 
[01:06:30]  And the grounds crew had to remove the tarp from underneath him where he was drooling.  Let me tell you something, Boston.  I have to say this today.  If this was happening in Philly, it would be a whole different ending, man.  Oof.  Wow.  I don't think they'd be singing along and helping the little fellow out.  Cut the top of his head open and pour the marbles that pop out down some stairs.  By the way, this is too good.  Snapman from Wackbag.  For Disability Awareness Day, did the Red Sox play the Yankees? 
[01:07:00]  Take it.  Take it.  Come on.  Okay.  Game games.  Go to the night that our flag was still there.  Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.  Oh, say the sad star, say your hand and your hand away.  Oh, the land of the free world. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, God, it's our flag.  This sucks.  oh come on man that was uh not a happy moment they just wanted the game to start i gotta be  completely honest with you yeah this is uh greg hughes the actor that oh honored i would probably  oh man i'm what i'm getting ready to be thrown under the bus but that's fine get a little i

But anyway, what do we got, Jimmy? 
[01:36:00]  Well, once again, the greatest haven for a certain group is paying out money.  $600 million.  $660?  Oh, you're right.  I read that wrong.  You're right.  $660 million.  Oh, man.  Why the hell are they still collecting our change?  They got this money to throw around.  They passed that basket around.  Why are they still tax-exempt?  Why is the church still tax-exempt?  One of the most mighty and powerful entities on the face of this planet, the Catholic Church, my friend. 
[01:36:30]  Well, they had to sell a few buildings, actually.  None of the archdiocese property, of course.  But they had to sell some buildings to pay, and now the settlement also calls...  Nursery schools.  No, that's what they bought.  They sold hospitals and other things and bought nursery schools.  Put up in Boy Scout dens.  They call for the release of a priest's confidential personnel files after review by a judge, because 
[01:37:00]  they always know who these guys are.  They always know that they're child molesters, and they just ship them somewhere else.  Yeah.  That's been a thing they've done for years.  Yeah.  Years.  And now they're paying off and apologizing to the victims.  So who gets the $660 million?  The victims.  Yeah, there's a bunch.  How many victims?  $660.  A little less.  Yeah, I heard about that.  They're going to get about a million each.  Yeah, about a million each.  Which, wow.  I mean, looking back, I certainly would have taken that.  I'm trying to find memories. 
[01:37:30]  I'm like, please, just have done something.  I mean, I look at myself as a communion picture.  How could you not?  It's all profit after you pay for that little inner tube you have to sit on the rest of  your life.  God, what is wrong with you guys?  Goodness gracious!  Yeah, I'm with you.  Goodness gracious.  That's horrid.  But it's funny.  While Mahoney, the Cardinal Mahoney, was making this apology, they were protesting outside.  Yeah.  They had some really harsh signs.  So one guy was marching with a sign that said, Phony Mahoney! 
[01:38:00]  Phony Mahoney!  Well, we got one on instant feedback.  Come ride the Mahoney pony.  Or, uh, I thought a couple of good ones would have been, uh, ouch, my hiney.  Um, uh, uh, hey, leave me alone-y.  Or, I wanna go home-y.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen!  Please don't bone me.  Stupid wordplay jokes.  They're always funny, though. 
[01:38:30]  You make all of us groany.  I want my mommy.  After we sit in there crying, I want a phone homie.  If there's some Preparation H, you can loam me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my.  Oh, my God.  I feel like there's a fire below me. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, my God.  What?  Ah, well.  Yeah, well.  You're a wrecked toucher!  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So, that's, uh, happening today.  $660 million, uh, payout.  Wow.  Wow-wee.  I don't care how much you want me to see it.  Please don't show me. 
[01:39:30]  Some signs that would have been more effective than, uh...  Yeah.  ...phoney Mahoney.  Yeah.  Hey, uh...  Oh, Snapman for Whackbag.  Me so mahoney!  They laughed in the middle of it.  Sorry, Snapman.  Me so mahoney!  Me!  Wow.  There's the showstopper.  That's a good one.  There you go, Snapman.  Here's one for Cleveland.  I feel like I got assaulted with a bat by Jim Tomey. 
[01:40:00]  Wow.  Stupid first baseman Indian fans enjoying that one.  The rest of the country gives me crickets.  All right.  There's a little priest, uh...  Another priest abuse story.  Yeah.  You're right, though.  It is like a, um...  It's like some kind of a club.  It's a haven.  Yeah.  Just a haven.  They will never acknowledge it.  It's just a special kind of guy that's willing to give up any sexual relations with a woman 
[01:40:30]  for the rest of his life.  That's like a very confused gentleman.  And Catholic religion, is that the only one where the priests and the leaders, whatever?  No, it's the only one, but it's the biggie.  Obviously the biggie.  It's the biggie.  That's why you don't hear about this.  I mean, rabbis occasionally do it, but you don't hear Jews doing this stuff because they  have families.  No.  They're not, uh, you know, they're not a bunch of just repressed, denying-the-sexuality  people who are, you know...  Plus, if you let the priests have families, then they can relate to the... 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, maybe then they'd be able to relate more to what it's like to be in a family and help you out  instead of just...  As a follower of the faith.  That's true.  But, uh...  Have a little experience.  You know, the, um, the books that were written by the scary people, uh, many years ago, uh,  say no, for some reason.  Yeah.  As you pray to the big, invisible guy.  The big, invisible people that we pray to, that we talk to and hope they listen and do  invisible things for us.  Yeah.  That's what we do.  All right. 
[01:41:30]  My God, we silly.  I hate humans.  I really don't like human beings.  I really want off this rock.  Oh, don't go anywhere.  I just want, you know, why can't I get the little, uh, metal little implant thing that  goes in your arm and then every so often, you know, you got to get the probe, but you  get to run around a spaceship.  You don't remember it, though.  You can go to another planet.  I don't remember that.  You don't remember it.  They block you in memory.  Oh, you get hypnotized.  You remember the alien Mahoney going at you. 
[01:42:00]  Listen, uh, I hate to do this to Jimmy, but, uh, Ohio's yelling at us, uh, right now.  What happened?  Tommy hasn't been in Cleveland for, like, five years.  I know.  I don't even know where he is, but he's the only, it's the last reference.  I think he's, uh, with the White Sox.  Oh, yeah.  It's coming in.  I'm not sure, though.  Yeah, Jim told me he was always, he'll always be a Cleveland Indian to me.  Oh, see.  There you go.  I don't care.  What do you want to do, a Larry Dobie joke, you idiots in Cleveland?  Well, you know, following that logic, Willie Mays will always be a Met to me.  There you go.  Oof.  Even though he played when he was 45 years old.  Uh, and then we had a great one come in, uh, from someone's cell phone. 
[01:42:30]  That's my no-touch Zoney.  We're such idiots.  Hey, uh, we got some great audio.  A woman, uh, calls 9-1-1 to, uh, report break-in.  Husband shoots suspect.  Good.  Bravo.  While she's still, while she's still on the phone.  Good.  This is exactly what Anthony would do.  Oh, I love these stories.  Let me hear it.  Let me hear it.  Yes, could you send somebody out to 10707 Northeast Gleason? 
[01:43:00]  Somebody's breakin' in my back door.  10707 Northeast Gleason?  Yes.  Is it a house or an apartment?  It's a house.  Do you have any of you who's breakin' in your back door?  I don't know.  I was asleep.  Have you seen them?  No, I just heard them makin' all this noise.  I'm like they're breakin' glass.  Okay, I got somebody started.  Thank you.  Is there anybody else in the house besides you?  Me, my husband, and my sister-in-law.  She's 84, he's 71, I'm 62.  Okay. 
[01:43:30]  Really?  What?  I got the 911 on the phone.  What can you hear now, Jen?  Excuse me?  What can you hear now?  I don't hear anything now.  Don't go out there, LeRoy.  My head was shot.  Does your husband have a gun out?  Yeah, he just shot.  What kind of gun does he have? 
[01:44:00]  Huh?  What kind of gun does he have?  A .38 revolver.  And what did he shoot at?  LeRoy, he said, what did you shoot at?  I shot the man.  He's out here.  He said he shot the man.  He's out here.  He said, did you hit him?  Yeah, I hit him.  Yeah, you say he hit him.  Go on.  I guess so.  We better bring the ambulance, too.  Please, sir.  Yeah.  The Bambalance.  Who is that idiot at 911?  Yeah.  What kind of gun?  Who cares?  What kind of gun was it?  You need an ambulance. 
[01:44:30]  No, could you bring a Yankee hat?  Wow.  I shot the man.  Yeah.  How did that end?  Anyone know?  Did we have an update on that?  Who cares?  Guy dead?  I don't know if he's dead or not.  I just like that.  Unfortunately, that's where the clip cuts off.  I couldn't find any more info.  Shot him outside his house, though.  Where was it?  When did it happen?  It's a little tricky.  Don't know.  Don't know the details.  Might have shot him through the door.  Yeah.  That's never good.  Hey, can we play Boo Got Shot with translation? 
[01:45:00]  Although you don't like when they get in your house, but sometimes you've got to hold off  a little bit.  Wait until they get in.  Yeah.  Someone always told me, if you've got to shoot him outside, pick him up and throw him  back through your window.  Are you kidding me?  That's right.  He jumped through my window, sir.  How much does that suck if he's all over your house and he gets outside when you shoot  him and then you could be in deep trouble, right?  It all depends on the circumstance.  If that guy was outside pointing a gun at the guy inside and he's still on your property,  you're completely justified. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We got Boo Got Shot with translation.  This is one of our favorites.  By Royal Marshall?  Who the hell is he?  Some dude.  He translated Boo Got Shot for everybody.  We go to break with this on the Opie and Anthony show.  Uh-huh.  She was shaking real bad.  It appears the young lady was trembling from nervousness.  And then she said, Peaches, they got shot.  They got shot.  Someone has been wounded.  I said, who?  Who?  I inquired as to who the victim was.  She said, Boo got shot.  Boo has suffered a gunshot. 
[01:46:00]  Boo got shot.  Boo has become the victim of another violent crime.  I said, oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh me.  Oh my.  We just saw it.  My suicide called somebody.  Oh my.  My sibling telephoned another relative.  She called my cousin.  Pumpkin just sailed up.  In fact, it was my cousin, Pumpkin, who lives in this very same community.  She called her and Pumpkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline.  Pumpkin was already on the phone with the local authorities.  And Chi-Chi, she had left out.  Chi-Chi had already departed.  She went and got in her car and she bailed out. 
[01:46:30]  She found her vehicle and put it in reverse.  And when she left out, then when I heard the gunshot again.  As she was departing, a shot rang out piercing the cold night air.  And when I heard the gunshot and I seen someone had run in the building over that way.  Apparently, the perpetrator was seeking cover behind a local building.  He ran in that building.  It was that building over there.  And I seen that car just flew off.  I saw the car depart with a rapid acceleration.  And then I seen a long gun.  I saw a firearm of substantial caliber. 
[01:47:00]  A big old gun.  I mean substantial caliber.  In fact, it was a gentleman in the backseat who had the firearm with the extended barrel.  And we're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots going on today.  We just played that 911 call.  We have an update on that, Jimmy?  Yeah, the guy, his name is Leroy Hudson.  He shot the other guy in the head.  Old codger.  Yeah, with good aim.  He was probably aiming for his stomach. 
[01:47:30]  But he shot him in the head.  And apparently the guy is in critical condition.  And he's inside an enclosed porch.  And the only fire went off and caught him in the head.  In the head with the .38 and he didn't kill him?  He's still alive.  I guess not.  Looked good for him.  Good.  More people ought to do that.  Someone comes into my house.  Dead.  I got the whole contingency plan worked out.  I got my safe room.  I show, you know, my close friends.  My close personal friends.  What I would do in that case. 
[01:48:00]  Do you have a good area, Jimmy?  What happens?  What happens?  Home invasion.  Someone knocks Federal Express.  I mean, UPS.  And then you open the door.  And what happens?  I get in the closet and I tell my girlfriend, answer that.  What happens?  I don't know.  You throw your lady friend at them?  I call the doorman.  There's nothing else I can do.  Oh, see?  You need a plan.  Plan of action.  You're a successful guy.  People, like, look for that.  You've got to protect yourself.  Some people call me paranoid. 
[01:48:30]  I'm a realist.  I wasn't going to say.  I'm a realist.  We have another 911 call.  This one is really good, too.  Supervisor didn't want to help.  Some of these people, I don't know how they keep their jobs.  They're 911 operators.  It seems like a pretty easy gig, you know?  Aside from the stress factor.  I mean, you know what to do.  When somebody calls and needs help, you send the help.  Yeah.  What's with the arguing with people sometimes? 
[01:49:00]  Unless it's somebody, you know, calling for a cab.  Then you hang up on them.  This one's great.  And then the guy has a sense of humor at the end.  I don't want to give away the whole thing here.  But listen.  New tonight, for the first time, we're hearing the chilling 911 call that ended in death because help wasn't there.  Nancy McGee was choking on a piece of meat when her boyfriend frantically called.  But no one was able to talk him through the Heimlich maneuver.  Tampa Bay's 10 News reporter Mike Deason has the latest on this story.  You'll see only on 10.  911, what is your emergency? 
[01:49:30]  My girlfriend.  I don't know if she's choking.  That's the call.  911 operator Jenny Montanino.  Gotta love it.  That's the call.  That's the call.  Still gotta talk like a newsman.  Yes.  I'm doing the news.  So I gotta put on my news for us.  That's the call.  That's the call.  And there's the call.  It's a high fly ball.  I mean, that's the call.  Why can't you just use your real voice?  They're incapable.  And who doesn't know how to do the Heimlich maneuver at this point in history? 
[01:50:00]  Is there anyone left?  She's trying to talk him through the Heimlich maneuver.  Yeah.  Who doesn't just know how to do that from the stupid posters on the wall?  Maybe he hated her and he wasn't really trying.  He was just sitting there panicking as she's choking.  He's like, oh, no, I'm trying.  But now that's happening.  This won't come out.  In his head, he's like, this is my lucky day.  How great is this?  Perhaps the piece of meat she was choking on didn't put him in the position where he  could do the Heimlich.  Absolutely.  I never thought of it.  Start to perform the Heimlich.  I can't.  I'm close.  Very close.  I can't get around behind. 
[01:50:30]  My girlfriend.  I don't know if she's choking.  That's the call 9-1-1 operator Jenny Montanino received, saying that Nancy McGee was choking  to death inside this Land O'Lakes home.  I'm like, man, over.  What is that?  You're behind her?  As part of the investigation, Montanino says she asked for assistance for what's called  emergency medical dispatch because she's not yet certified to do this.  But her supervisor, Dave Cook, who in the past has been disciplined for sleeping on duty,  said, I am not getting on with a hysterical caller. 
[01:51:00]  Please come on.  They're on their way, sir.  Wouldn't get on with a hysterical caller?  It's 9-1-1.  Why are you allowed to keep your job if you fall asleep while doing it?  Especially a 9-1-1 operator.  That guy should be gone.  After the caller hung up in frustration, Montanino called him back and eventually Cook got on  the line.  But the caller was getting more upset.  Is he alert?  No, no, sir. 
[01:51:30]  Is he alert?  No, sir.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  You can't do it?  No, sir.  I'm sorry.  All right.  I'm going to give you back to the operator, OK?  The report says Cook dropped the phone receiver onto the desk and said, see, he's not listening.  She didn't come around?  No, no.  She didn't come around?  She's breathing in her mouth, no.  She's breathing?  I guess so.  I don't think so.  And not only was there confusion here inside the Pasco 911 center, but also emergency units 
[01:52:00]  were out of place.  So even though there is a fire station just 7.6 miles away, it took 11 minutes before someone  arrived on the scene.  And by that time, Nancy McGee was dead.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That's awful.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Brutal.  But if you don't, you know, you should really know how to do that Heimlich maneuver. 
[01:52:30]  Well, here comes the best part of the story.  It's a heck of a 9-1-1 operation.  That's what McGee's mother told us last week from receiving home.  At the time, we didn't know that the investigation would show that Cook laughingly said after the  woman died, another one bites the dust.  And I guess she bit off more than she can chew.  Cook, who was found sleeping on the job again the day after the incident, turned in his resignation  for medical reasons.  He's a shock operator. 
[01:53:00]  Refuses to comment, saying it's still investigating.  What do you need to investigate?  The guy's an ass.  Resigned for medical reasons.  That's a good one.  Got to remember that next time we get in trouble.  That's a good idea.  We resigned for medical reasons.  We're retarded.  How tired are you when you sleep through a choking?  Good point, Jimmy.  Don't wake me.  I think we got to go and play the classic one.  Which one's that?  Uh, the guy who kills his wife.  We have to play.  It's been a while.  Yeah, that's a good one. 
[01:53:30]  I think this is our favorite 911 call.  He was a little, uh...  Guy was married...  He was a little off.  Guy was married to his wife for many, many, many years and just had it.  Just had it.  I can understand how this guy might be a little upset.  Shoots his wife and then calls 911.  North Richland Hills, 911.  That's it.  Hello?  This is Freddie Wilhite.  How can I help you?  I shot my wife in the stomach, but it's 38.  What address are you at?  84-32. 
[01:54:00]  Is she still there?  Yeah, she's laying on the floor.  And what is your name?  Freddie Wilhite.  Where's the gun at?  What?  Where's the gun?  What?  It's in the closet.  What is her name?  Donna.  Is there anybody else there with you?  No.  Okay.  Why did he do this?  She enticed me. 
[01:54:30]  And she would ridicule me throughout my lifetime.  Okay.  And you're at 84-32?  That's it, baby.  Barbara.  Barbara.  Okay, I'm going to get somebody out there.  He needs a new chick.  He's, like, picking up on her.  I'm in my dining room.  I don't know if she's dead or not.  How long ago did this happen? 
[01:55:00]  A few minutes.  Okay.  You're still alive.  I'll see if she's alive.  Sir?  What?  You're alive?  You're dead.  Do what?  Paul, sit here.  You didn't show me.  He said he shot a wife of a stomach.  You there?  Are you there?  Sir, I'm here.  I think she did. 
[01:55:30]  Is there anybody else in the house with you?  No.  Yes.  Total of four units up there.  And reduce the rest of the other man.  I'm peaceable.  It's okay.  Okay, sir.  It's okay.  I understand.  I've got help coming up there.  I just want to stay on the line with you until they get there.  Okay, okay.  And then I'll go down.  I'm sorry?  I'll go down.  Okay.  Okay.  You all right?  That is just amazing.  He don't care. 
[01:56:00]  He's just, I'll go down.  He's happy.  He's like, I don't have to worry about her anymore.  And then he wants to make sure he didn't wreck her day.  You all right?  You all right?  You all right?  You all right?  I'm peaceable.  She entashed me.  Unbelievable.  Let's go to Jessica in Jersey.  You can see how cranky he got because she said something.  He goes, what?  What?  She's a short-tempered man.  Our favorite part is berber.  Yeah, that's right, baby.  Berber.  Berber.  Jessica, what's up?  Yeah, I was just saying, I was just CPR certified on Friday. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  And the one thing that they tell you is that when you call 911, they have this, like, giant, godlike flip book in front of them that all you have to do is flip to what's going on.  Like, oh, the person's choking.  You flip to choking.  And the operator is able to read, if, you know, they can read, through what you're supposed to do, stand behind the person, find their heads, like, to be able to tell you what to do.  I don't understand how someone couldn't have been able to handle it.  And, you know, that call to me sounded like, instead of yelling at the poor guy, who's very despondent at the time, instead of yelling at him that he's not listening, just give him instruction. 
[01:57:00]  And kind of tell him, look, you've got to listen to this.  Get behind her.  Are you doing that?  Are you behind her?  Take your hand.  Say it over and over again, and maybe it'll sink in somehow.  Put it just below the ribcage.  Like, walk him through it.  They weren't telling him anything, but you've got to calm down.  You've got to calm down.  He's not going to calm down.  But you might be able to get it through his head to where he starts doing what he's got to do.  A lot of these people are just, like, unskilled, unintelligent, can't think on their feet people that are at these 911 operations centers. 
[01:57:30]  But more importantly, Jessica's just starting on the job.  She's still motivated.  Yeah, that's true.  Obviously, you were listening to a guy that's like, oh, I'm so sick of this stupid job, just like we all get.  But in his case, he's supposed to be saving lives.  Well, I'm on my way to my job right now, and I'm sick of it still.  But it doesn't mean I'm just going to stop watching the children, you know?  Like, I don't know.  It just seems like these people are just idiots. 
[01:58:00]  I don't know what state they're from, but it seems like something pretty slow.  All right, Jessica.  Good luck to you.  All right.  Have a good day.  Watch the children.  All right.  People are requesting more 911 calls.  Maybe we'll try to squeeze a couple more in before we get out of here.  We got the bungee accident.  And, of course, we got the sniper thing, which is a great story.  Hey, I love this guy.  The sniper story is just amazing.  Apparently, didn't care if he got caught.  Kind of stupid, right?  We'll explain in a second here, but just not the smartest guy. 
[01:58:30]  Good shot, though.  It was a...  You want to play the audio?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A manhunt is underway in Wyoming.  Police there are searching for a National Guard sniper accused of shooting his estranged wife  while she was on stage singing.  Laura Engel has the latest for us.  Laura?  Hi, Molly.  Well, a country music show in North Cheyenne turned into a murder scene when the singer  was shot in front of a live audience.  It happened fast and with no warning, and now police are looking for the person who could  have fired a shot with such precision. 
[01:59:00]  The victim is Robin Muniz.  She was separated from her husband and was a singer in the band Tie in the Twisters, as  well as an employee with the State Department of Health's Developmental Disabilities Division.  The day before she died, Cheyenne police say she called to complain about harassing phone  calls her husband was reportedly making.  He's a National Guardsman with sniper training.  Sniper training.  From outside the club, he gets her in the head while she's singing on stage. 
[01:59:30]  What a shot.  Hoorah!  I guess he wanted everyone to know who did it.  Yeah, that's not one of those kind of, you know, you shouldn't do that if you're a sniper.  Right, right.  He shot his wife from that book suppository building, sir.  Yeah, the bullet that killed her ended up lodged in a door frame.  Police suspect it was shot from the parking lot behind the restaurant.  So this guy, like, how far away was he? 
[02:00:00]  They, not sure exactly, but they were saying it could be from a pretty good distance.  And, you know, if it was just some guy ran in, shot her with a shotgun, perhaps, or something,  but a sniper shot like that, he was showing off is what he was doing.  Yeah.  David Muniz was in the Wyoming National Guard, a trained sniper,  and is known to have several long guns, according to investigators.  Robin was killed by a single shot in the head, fired from outside the restaurant. 
[02:00:30]  Customers at the old Chicago restaurant and bar say at first they thought it was just a speaker blowing up,  then they looked over and saw Robin Muniz on the floor.  Police have been questioning other customers who saw a black pickup in the parking lot speeding away from the scene.  David Muniz has disappeared, and investigators say the National Guardsman is now wanted for murder.  He is 6'4", 215 pounds, has brown hair, hazel eyes, and at times wears glasses.  He does own a 1999 black Dodge Ram pickup truck with very identifiable plates that start with NG. 
[02:01:00]  That stands for National Guard.  The rest of the plate is 975.  Investigators continue to try to figure out just how far away the shooter was from Robin Muniz  to figure out what kind of rifle the killer used to shoot her.  Very distinctive plates, WFKLR.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah.  Got a little bit of audio, because I guess it was being recorded.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Let's see if she sounded... 
[02:01:30]  Is she a good singer?  Is she a good singer?  Sometimes it's hard to be a woman.  It's not bad.  No.  She sounds just...  Give him all your love to...  What was her name?  One man.  Oh, the chick.  Tribute to her.  You'll have...  Wow.  Robin.  Muniz.  And you'll have... 
[02:02:00]  Sounds good.  You'll have...  Good times.  Doing things that you don't understand.  Not bad.  But if you love him...  Oh, the verse, Jesus Christ.  Come on.  It's just a long song.  The money shot, you son of a bitch.  He's hard to understand.  It's nice.  This song sucks.  Glad she's dead.  Because if you love him... 
[02:02:30]  You know, the woman should get a little tribute like this.  I don't understand.  I got to mock her.  I think she sounds good.  Especially for playing some crappy club.  Yeah, it's a good recording.  It is.  Stand by, young man.  Are you kidding me?  What?  A two-minute song for that.  I think the amazing thing was that the husband waited all that time to shoot her at the chorus. 
[02:03:00]  Are you kidding me?  And in rhythm with the music.  It's amazing.  Because you think he would have known, like, well, you know, it's almost nine.  And he would have shot her during the first few...  You know, at the beginning, she's off to the side, though.  For that part, she gets in the middle of the stage and puts her arms out.  Yeah.  And when she said, stand by your man, he was very angry because she wasn't...  I knew where you were going, but I'm like, it's going to take two minutes to get there.  Who knew there were two choruses before the... 
[02:03:30]  Actually...  ...verses before the chorus came in.  Actually, I got it, but you got the gun, right?  No.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  All right.  There you go. 
[02:04:00]  Are you hungover over there?  You're not here.  Trust me, you're here.  You're ruining the whole flow of the show.  You're here.  Nothing helps a radio show than a PD, like, slumped over, looking like she's, like, hungover.  You're what?  I'm hiding from Tom.  You're hiding from Tom?  Why?  What happened? 
[02:04:30]  Dude, you're slouched on a couch as we're trying to entertain America.  Looking like you're hungover.  What happened?  I'm hiding.  Disguise yourself as an apple.  He can't go near him with the braces.  Or a piece of tinfoil.  Ow.  You're in trouble with Tom?  For what?  Pot.  Pot.  Smoking.  Pot.  Look in the mirror and you want some pot?  Why are you hiding from Tom?  I'll tell you later.  Oh.  Well, you're wrecking the flow of the show, so you might as well give us something. 
[02:05:00]  I did something he's going to be mad at.  What is that?  Or a bra?  I did.  I did.  So you're just going to sit there until 9 o'clock?  Is it bothering you?  Well, you're not sitting there digging the show, so it doesn't really help us.  I'm trying not to interrupt your flow.  Flow?  You're slouched over like you had a rough weekend.  What would you like me to do?  Stand up and sing? 
[02:05:30]  Or not be seen.  Like, if you're going to be in here, look at even Kenny's always smiling and he's sitting  up and he's like, he's ready.  He's got the energy.  There you go.  I love you guys.  That's what Kenny says.  Yeah.  That is true.  She did look like she was testifying in a murder trial.  And why do I, I always have to be the bad guy.  Like, no one else felt like the energy in the room sucked the last 20 minutes?  My back's turned.  Yeah.  You felt it, though.  That's why I was like pumping.  See, no one else is willing to admit it.  I was pumping out some energy.  No, I just sort of. 
[02:06:00]  Did you feel a weird energy, Jimmy?  Be honest.  Thank you.  Yeah, because you were looking to the side.  Thank you.  Almost like, as if gazing to things that made her laugh.  So now tell us why Tom is mad at you.  Because sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness instead of permission.  All right.  So what's the deal?  Let's go.  This is, this is what radio is all about.  I don't really like to talk on the microphone.  I'm not an air personality.  We were going to do 10,000 marbles.  You asked.  That would be much more entertaining than talking to me.  Wait, what, what, what, what was it? 
[02:06:30]  What did you have to ask?  Is it a promo?  Yeah.  Is it a phone call?  Is it a promo?  Was it a phone call?  No, it wasn't a phone call.  A promo about pot smoking?  Something like that, yes.  And you just threw it on the air?  He wasn't around.  Nice.  Oh, okay.  Why, we love this girl.  Why, why would you get in trouble?  All right, where's the promo?  We got to hear it now.  And what was the problem he had?  I meant get high with K-Rock, and he thought it was just a little over the top.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:07:00]  Why would we want to do that?  It's associated with rock bands and stuff.  Why would you want to embrace that?  But get high doesn't actually mean smoking pot.  It doesn't mean anything with drugs.  It's like you get high with the station.  Yeah, getting high on life, man.  You're getting high.  Yeah, you're getting high with the music.  K-Rock.  You listen to the music, endorphins are pumping.  Right, right, right.  Nice.  Right?  He told you no a while ago.  I know, but it's been on anyway.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, we were hoping you were going to be around for a while.  Oh, jeez.  You're so done. 
[02:07:30]  I love it.  Oh, no.  We've already been through two.  You're the third in like barely over a year.  And he just found out about it?  Well, I don't know if he found out.  Well, now he did because you just brought it up.  And it played all weekend?  Yeah.  I remember you telling us that he didn't want you running that.  I know, but I thought I fixed it.  By what?  I added the word legally in it.  Get high legally.  Legally.  That kind of ruined the flow.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, he's going to.  Oh, God.  I can't wait.  Meeting.  Cole.  I can't wait.  That's why I'm hiding out here and you just blew up my spot.  Well, there's not many options up here.  He probably would have figured studio sooner or later.  Yeah, but he wouldn't interrupt during your show.  Oh, yes, he would.  Oh, he would.  He's a pro at that.  Yeah, sure is.  He'll pop right in.  He smells fun.  Yes.  I smell fun.  I must rid the room of it.  Tom smells fun and comes running with a fire extinguisher.  He takes all the fun out of the room.  How dare you have fun on the radio in the year 2007? 
[02:08:30]  You always know he's heard some fun when he's running down the hallway with a siren on the  top of his head and a flashing light in a hose.  He's the fun police.  Laughs happening.  Out of the way.  Out of the way.  I got to get in there and extinguish the fun.  Hey, I'm a fun guy.  Are you?  Don't tell me one thing you do that's fun.  I read.  Poker night.  He plays golf.  He plays golf and he plays poker on Mondays, Jimmy.  Nixon plays golf.  His friends are not fun.  And watch how much fun he's going to have yelling at her in about 15 minutes. 
[02:09:00]  I like Tom, but he's not a fun guy by my stand.  But you know what?  I'm with Tracy.  If you're going to be bringing K-Rock back, you got to kind of have a little attitude.  The kids that listen to the station, they smoke a little dope.  You can't make believe this stuff isn't happening.  Well, according to the lawyers.  The station smoke a little dope.  The lawyers okayed this one.  They said, hey, have fudge with K-Rock.  Have a diet decaf Coke with K-Rock.  Uh-oh, Tom has entered the room.  Ah.  I made you look. 
[02:09:30]  You got me, too.  I need rear-view mirrors on my computer monitors so I can see what's creeping up behind me.  All right, so you're in trouble for that.  Are you in trouble for anything else?  I don't know yet.  What do you mean?  What else did you do?  I'm not going to admit to what I've done.  If he hasn't found out about it yet, he'll find out later.  Smart.  Maybe we should bring Tom in for the last minute of the show.  Okay.  Is he around?  Actually, we're running out of show.  We got a minute.  You know, we got a break right at 855, right?  If you wanted to get me out of the studio, you've just done it. 
[02:10:00]  Why?  You don't want to confront Tom?  No.  Oh, she is running.  Now she runs, and she's just bounced out of the studio.  She is running.  She's exactly running.  She's on heels.  I heard that.  She kind of tee-hee-heed out.  Tee-hee-hee.  This place is a mess.  It really is.  She invited me to the beach with her friends.  What the?  All right, now I've got to read this.  Yeah.  Like, over the weekend, Tracy's our new PD here in New York, and I got her email address  and her phone numbers, and I just wrote, hey, finally put your emails into my BlackBerry, 
[02:10:30]  so now we can kind of keep in touch on a daily basis.  The best way, because she's trying to meet with us and try to, you know, help us out with  the radio show.  Uh-huh.  But we haven't been around, because we're really, really busy, so I'm like, the best  way is to just send a lot of emails through the BlackBerry, and I have it on me all the  time, and I'll answer.  So I thought that was a professional thing to do.  This is what I get back from her.  Do you want to come to the beach with me tomorrow?  I look pretty good in a bikini, but don't tell your girlfriend that.  Call me on my cell if you're up for it. 
[02:11:00]  Wow.  Hope read that in the office, and then it reminded me.  I'm like, holy jeez, I totally forgot this.  She invited me to sleep over her house on Friday.  What happened with that?  I was in the elevator going downstairs, and I was like, oh my god, it's been such a long  week, because we got like Philly, and we did all the stuff there, and all the hours that  we took, and then finally Friday rolled around, we got done with the show, and all I wanted 
[02:11:30]  to do was go home and crash, you know?  Sure.  So I was like, I'm exhausted.  She goes, I got a place right here in the city.  You want to, you know, you want to come over and go to sleep?  That's not a problem.  I was like, oh, thank you, you know, thanks, but, you know, I'm in an eight-year relationship  with a girl who would, like, shoot me, and you.  That's funny, that reminds me.  Wait, wait, before you...  Oh, Jimmy's got something.  Let's see.  Steve, you're not getting out of this, sorry.  I saw you, like, trying to hide behind me. 
[02:12:00]  No, I was actually...  Because then I told my email story, Ant tells his story, and then Steve goes, uh, how do  I say this?  Oh, it's great.  He's the only one that could get fired in this scenario.  Yeah.  He's firing me for what I said, or what Ant said.  I'm not a CBS employee.  Ha ha.  Go ahead.  Um, yeah, she's had a dry spell for, uh, some time.  Jeez.  No, there was more to it.  Well, she was, well, she was in, uh, she was in the, uh, in a meeting with us.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  And she said, um, I don't know how to say the other part.  How to say the other part of it.  She hasn't had action in 19 months?  Something like that?  And she needs, uh...  Yeah, how do you say that part?  Ah, she needs, you know...  A little action.  A little action.  Okay.  I got an email from Steve.  I look good in a bikini.  Join me on the beach.  It actually reminds me.  What happened to you?  She and I haven't said two words to each other.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  All right.  Well, I want to thank Tracy for wrecking the flow of the last 20 minutes of the show. 
[02:13:00]  Good job as the new PD.  Bravo.  Bravo to you.  Slumped over, looking hungover as we're trying to entertain people.  Ha ha ha.  Jimmy's, uh, going to be in Chicago.  Another book signing.  Jimmy, CKG's listening.  What do you got?  Yeah, tomorrow night, I will be, tomorrow night, I'll be at 7.30 p.m.  at the book signing Borders in Chicago, uh, 2817 North Clark Street.  Uh, it's tomorrow night.  I'll be signing my book in Chicago.  And tomorrow is $10 ticket Tuesday for our comedy tour.  Yes.  Except for Boston, because Boston's doing that other thing for the military.  If you've got a military ID, you get in free this Saturday. 
[02:13:30]  Keep listening to BCN for all the details on that.  Yes.  And listen to the other local stations for the $10 ticket thing, okay?  It's a great, great deal, and it's only going to happen on, uh, Tuesday, tomorrow.  Yes.  It's brought to you by Bud Light, always worth it, our comedy tour.  Hey, if you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ah, that killed 16 minutes.  Yeah.  Second half of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  That walkover. 
[02:14:00]  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Hey, where are we at with the XM, uh, studio?  Still the same?  Now, hold on.  What's going on with the XM studio?  Now, the last time we checked with E-Rock about, uh, the studio that they were building  for us, remember they said it was only going to take, what, two weeks?  Three weeks?  Two weeks.  How many weeks?  Weeks.  Anywhere from three to four weeks.  It was supposed to be done by the end of July.  Yeah, the end of July.  Three to four weeks.  Uh, but they said, uh, two to two and a half.  Then they upped it to three to four weeks.  I think...  How long have we been here now? 
[02:14:30]  Over a month, right?  Yeah.  The last answer I got, I said, how long?  And they said, when pigs fly, motherfucker.  We're looking for those.  Wait, we did a 30-day suspension.  We came back and we did one show over at XM.  So what day was that?  Anyone remember?  Help us out on this if you back or pal talk.  No clue.  That was the 15th of June.  Oh, okay.  Uh, uh...  The virus at Jones Beach was June... 
[02:15:00]  16th.  16th?  Okay.  Friday the 15th.  So the 15th.  So today is what?  Uh, Monday, July 16th.  So it's been a month already and there's not even a hint of construction going on at this  point.  They're taking stuff out.  Dude, XM, you gotta help us out.  We gotta get the fuck out of this building after the first half of the show.  Yeah.  We have to.  It's wrecking everything.  We gotta be able to get back to doing some things in studio that we, uh, we would do  over there that we can't do here or convenient or legal. 
[02:15:30]  They're a bit tight-assed around here, too.  Tight-assed.  And, uh, and I thought this was a fine arrangement, but then when Tom decided that, uh, we're not  a lot of naked women on our XM show either, as long as we do it from here, then I was  like, holy shit, hurry up with the construction and get us out of here.  Uh, pretty much everything we want to do that involves people coming up into here to do  it, which we'd normally do over at XM, uh, has to go through him.  Right, right, right, right.  And, and he's saying no to this, that, and the other thing. 
[02:16:00]  So we just sit up here.  We can't have, you know, I, we, I liked having a live audience and, uh, doing the walk  over and grabbing some freaks and bringing them up, things like that.  But, um, we could kind of let our hair down.  Let our hair down.  So, so where are we at?  Well, the last photos we have of the studio.  Hold on.  I remember you said there was two ladders, then one.  But then they brought the ladder back.  All right.  So that was the last update we gave everybody.  Within a week's time, we saw two ladders in, in the place that used to be our old studio. 
[02:16:30]  That's the only thing left in the room.  They took out everything.  So if you've been over there, all those counters and all that is gone.  So they had two ladders, one ladder, back to two ladders within a week to 10 days time,  right?  So what did, what do they got today?  What are we looking at?  It's still exactly the same.  Oh my goodness gracious.  Get Don Wicklin on the phone.  Let's call Don right now.  Don Wicklin.  Get Don.  What about Elo?  I know he's just a puppet.  Uh, get Elo, actually.  Yeah.  Let's go right to Elo.  Go up the strings.  Yeah.  Don, Don's the guy you call if like, uh, hey Don, uh, we need more t-shirts. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, okay.  I'll have him print it up.  That's what Don's there for.  Jason from Rye, might be some truth to this.  Get real, Opie.  Don't you realize that this is just an extended way of firing you?  They get you out of the building, stop letting Elo talk to you, and bam.  And then in his Vince McMahon, he types, you're fired.  You're fired.  Well...  That's pretty long. 
[02:17:30]  You know, we weren't born yesterday.  Fall.  Turn the truck.  Something's up.  Because they really wanted this on the fast track.  They wanted to build a studio within three or four weeks.  I think, um, I think they were, I think they wanted to start construction before we got  suspended, matter of fact.  Did a check bounce?  Something's going on.  What happened?  And I'd rather them be honest with us.  Is everything on hold because of the merger talks?  What's going on?  You can't tell me that it's, they're waiting for permits and crap like that. 
[02:18:00]  The last thing we heard was, uh, there was some kind of issue with the contractors and  there may be new contractors and...  Yeah, but that's the type of crap you say when, uh, you don't want to say the real reason.  That's like the, that's the reason you expect to hear.  You know what I mean?  Oh, contractor problems.  Oh, contractor union on strike.  So they left their ladders there and took off.  Well, they took one for another job and brought it back.  I really want to know what's going on.  I want to know when they're thinking this whole thing's going to be complete. 
[02:18:30]  I want to know what Elo's been doing.  Elo's been...  Haven't heard from him.  He got a little mad at me because I said he was down to a two handicap.  He goes, close, but not, not a two.  That's what he got mad at.  Oh, golf.  When we were making fun of the fact that he's not really working anymore and he's working  on his golf game.  Yeah.  I said, I think he was a 10 and I said, I think he's down to a two now or something  like that.  Uh-huh.  And he got mad at me because I said a two.  And he's like, no, it's not that low yet.  That's what I got mad at last week. 
[02:19:00]  I haven't heard from him.  You heard last week?  Wow.  A little bit, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, a little bit.  No, not a word, not a peep from Elo.  So, and of course, we can't get anyone on the line, so...  No, that never happens either.  You know, honesty is the best policy.  Why don't you just tell us today what the hell is really going on?  Is there a building down there anymore?  Huh?  Yeah.  Maybe there isn't even a building down there.  But something's going on.  We're running out of someone's basement. 
[02:19:30]  Is everything on...  Huge basement.  Is everything on hold until the merger talks go through or fall apart?  Is that...  Just tell me.  Yeah.  Is that what's going on?  Help us out.  Elo, here's the famous E, Lowe.  E to the Lowe.  E, Lowe.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hi, Elo.  Oh, that sounded chipper.  Hey, guys.  What hole are you on today?  Just making the turn.  Just making the turn.  At the county shack.  Yeah.  You'll get nothing unlike it.  Yeah, it's funny here, you know, because you're playing in a valley, so when you make 
[02:20:00]  the turn, you do a signal.  So I told Stan we had to hurry.  Hey, Elo, we start a bit where we take pictures of the studio space every day.  Yeah.  And in the last 10 days, all we've seen is one ladder go to two ladders, and two ladders  go to one ladder.  Yeah, the exit's over here, guys.  Hold on a second.  I'm leaping blindly to the...  Flair!  Flair!  The exit's over here.  Oh.  Mass firing today?  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:20:30]  Hey, Flair.  The exit's over here.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Mass firing.  It's like the Poseidon Adventure down there.  They're trying to figure out the easiest way out of that.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  Oh, my radio.  Sorry.  Now we're...  I've got a group of people trying to find a car at an airport.  Hey, Elo.  Yeah, but...  What's going on with our studio?  It's, boy, it's coming, isn't it?  It's working good.  But just be honest with us.  What's really going on?  No, yeah.  Is everything on hold?  No, nothing's on hold.  It's a permit issue. 
[02:21:00]  What happened was, when we changed the glass, we had to insert an I-beam, so then we had to  go through a process to get the windows taken out of the street to put a crane up to bring  the I-beam into the window, and then that wouldn't happen because of the building.  It's because it's a historic building, as you know.  Right.  So then we called the engineer and said, can we cut the I-beam in half and have it  fused together to put it back in?  That's happening.  So I know that there doesn't look like there's anything going on, but it's been an issue of  getting permits done, and the last thing is the final plans, which are supposed to 
[02:21:30]  be certified this Thursday, where everything is done.  So, I mean, it's moving.  Yes, it's slow, but it's moving.  I like it.  I mean, listen, we made some changes, and we wanted to do it right the first time,  and so we didn't have it half-assed, but it is moving.  Okay.  It was supposed to be done already.  Well, that part I do know.  You know where we are, right?  I know where you are.  You feel like this thing, you're in hell, you're at K-Rock, you can't have nudie girls 
[02:22:00]  in there without pasties, I got it.  We're on Goody Two-Shoes Avenue.  It's like fucking doing a show from Candyland.  If we mention the word tits, we have to slide down and eat a lolly.  I don't even know what that means.  It's kind of wrecking the flow of what we do there, Elo.  So when's the new due date?  The new due date, I think it's...  I actually don't know.  I don't have it on top of my head, to be really honest with you.  I asked that question on Friday.  Well, with permits and stuff, it's kind of hard to tell. 
[02:22:30]  Does it make you feel any better?  Does it make you feel any better that it's worse for Ron and Fez because they're actually  in that little broadcast booth still?  I don't know how they do a show from in that closet.  Yeah.  We might have to start doing that.  I'm surprised they haven't killed me.  We might have to start doing that.  Do the walkover and then do the show from the closet?  Yeah.  Just so we can...  Or you can just...  Transportation.  Ground transportation.  People follow the goddamn signs.  Jesus Christ.  Where are you going with this tour?  Well, it's not...  We're going to Harpo, and it's like... 
[02:23:00]  You know, we're walking through an airport, and there's signs everywhere.  It's like, hello?  In Chicago?  Yeah, I'm in Chicago.  You're going to Oprah's digs.  Why didn't you invite us?  Yeah.  We'd like to meet Oprah.  Oprah's a big fan of this show.  Yeah.  We found that out.  Yeah.  Hey, are you there tomorrow?  Elo, are you in Chicago tomorrow?  No, I'm leaving.  I'm on like a 9 o'clock flight back tonight.  I got an order meeting this week back in D.C.  But I was going to see you at my book signing. 
[02:23:30]  Why won't you be there?  Oh, what time's your book signing?  7.30 p.m. at Borders.  I told...  We talked about this.  It's Borders on North Clark Street.  I said, Elo, will you be there?  And you said, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Jimmy, I'm sorry.  You broke up.  Could you give me that address one more time?  Oh.  Atta boy, Elo.  Elo.  Eric, Eric, the plug-in machine.  28-17 North Clark.  This is that new book, Happy Endings, right?  Can't you get that on Amazon.com or something? 
[02:24:00]  You certainly can.  Wow.  And I gave Elo's Barbara a thank you.  Oh.  I don't like the fact...  How did you not know that already?  I have not known...  I did not know that.  I've not gotten my book,  so I may have to go to the Borders tomorrow night  here in Washington.  Right.  Yeah, why not?  Why are you in Chicago anyway?  Uh, I got...  Oh.  I didn't see it coming.  I saw the phone call ending. 
[02:24:30]  I'm back.  That's right.  But I didn't see that coming.  That's right.  I'm back.  Wow.  A little slump.  There goes Elo.  A little slump.  Hung up on...  Let's see what K-Rock's doing today.  Oh.  Why aren't they playing...  Remember on the last time we checked in?  No, last time was...  Oh, Alice in Chains?  Uh, no, um...  Smashing Pumpkins.  Oh, right, right.  Okay.  And, you know, Don said that Billy Corrigan's a big fan of our show. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  I think we caught him in a lie, too.  Well, apparently he did say...  Well, he cursed, and then he said,  Oh, wait.  Opie and Anthony curse all the time.  All the time.  And that translated into that he's a huge fan of the show.  Like, he's just listening right now.  Hey, Billy.  What's going on?  Billy, call us up.  Give a call.  Such a big fan that he thought,  Ah, I don't need to promote my new CD.  I'm one of the biggest radio shows in America.  No.  If he has that connection, and he's a fan of the show, 
[02:25:30]  why wouldn't he try to get on our show?  Yeah.  Oh, I hate liars.  They're among us.  Liars everywhere.  Well, Don may have been just trying to make everybody feel good.  All right, get Don on the phone.  Don, call the show right now.  He may have been...  Like, Billy may have said,  Oh, yeah, I've heard of those guys.  They're pretty good.  Or, yeah, those guys went so funny.  And Don might have just said,  You know, those guys are a fan.  They like you.  You know how things are.  Yeah, sure.  But you know how things translate.  Like, you know, like a girl says,  Oh, your friend's cute.  Your friend will come over and go, 
[02:26:00]  Dude, she likes you.  Like, when she was just being polite,  Saying, Oh, he's kind of cute.  What do you need Don Wicklund for?  Why are you defending him?  Actually, nothing.  Oh, okay.  I'm only playing devil's advocate.  Oh.  He's a blue-eyed psychopath.  Are you an advocate for the devil a lot?  I have to, though,  Because you don't want to go out on a limb and say,  Yeah, he did this.  And all of a sudden,  It's like saying, like,  Elo,  Oh, man, they're fucking,  They're not doing the work.  You go,  Well, let's just see what's happening.  And then we don't look ridiculous.  92.3, K-Rock, Nirvana. 
[02:26:30]  Wow.  Oh, sorry.  Good one.  So, uh,  You have to cut it.  Otherwise...  The devil is instant feedback.  It says,  Jimmy, stop speaking for me.  Well, the problem with the devil,  He's always late for his appointments.  I send him depositions,  But they just get burned up in the fire.  32.3.  Yeah.  Three days, Grace.  Never too late.  All right.  I like this song.  All right.  All right.  Anyway,  We got the uncensored,  That's what I wanted to hear.  Yeah.  Now we're getting into the show.  Now I want to hear... 
[02:27:00]  At 9.30,  We're finally getting into the show.  Here we go.  Damn it.  Illinois Senator Barack Obama,  Who spoke before a group of trial lawyers in Chicago yesterday,  Has raised more than $34 million.  That's a million more than New York Senator Hillary Clinton,  Who has raised $33 million.  Oh.  And Jimmy,  That's why we couldn't play it.  Wow.  At the other joint.  Did she just say Hillary Clinton?  Wow.  That isn't even close to her name.  Wow. 
[02:27:30]  And that's why we couldn't play it earlier.  Again.  Illinois Senator Barack Obama,  Who spoke before a group of trial lawyers in Chicago,  Yesterday has raised more than $34 million.  That's a million more than New York Senator Hillary Clinton,  Who has raised $33 million.  It's going to be a meeting today on that one.  Yeah.  And she goes,  Yeah.  She doesn't know what...  She doesn't even know what she said.  She had no idea that she fucked up.  They had to tell her,  Oh my God,  Billy Corrigan is checking in.  Holy shit.  I think I was wrong. 
[02:28:00]  Billy,  It's a pleasure to have you on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's going on, sir?  The world is a...  Meow.  The world is a meow.  I doubt that was really him.  I'm going to say and play the end of the clip here.  He's raised more than $34 million.  That's a million more than New York Senator Hillary Clinton, 
[02:28:30]  Who has raised $33 million.  There's going to be a meeting today on that one.  7-9-6-39,  And you're there for more than seven minutes away from weather and...  All right.  Hey, we finally...  Yeah.  We have the Smashing Pumpkins clip from XM,  R's Confidential,  Where he talks about Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see if this translates into  Huge fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  As per...  As per Don Wicklund.  Mr. Exat...  What?  The intention of the conversation was not,  Is this the right person for you? 
[02:29:00]  It's,  This is what we do  To make hits 2007.  You're a little out of touch.  You know what I mean?  Instead, we turn to the person that we respected most.  And that's why we're here.  You know?  It's the way it should be.  Absolutely.  You know?  What's up next?  Fuck him.  Politely,  Fuck him.  It's satellite.  Say whatever I want. 
[02:29:30]  Opie and Anthony swear, right?  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Fuck him.  Oh, wow.  Hey.  Hey.  All right.  Well, you know.  That's a big fan.  Wow, that guy.  He's a borderline pest.  I don't like it.  He's aware of us.  That's kind of neat.  That is.  So are people in South Africa  after that fucking Condoleezza Rice thing.  Everybody knows about the show.  By the way, have we tried to get Billy Corgan on the show since we've been aware of this  clip for the last three days, four days, five days?  Yes, Steve.  Steve.  Steve. 
[02:30:00]  Yes, we're dating.  And?  Oh, well, Ant just said it, so why bother?  Yeah, it is one of the things that's in the works.  It has been at K-Rock and...  It doesn't have to be in the works.  He obviously knows who we are.  He just did an artist confidential.  It's just, it's as easy as getting a phone call.  Yeah.  Did you say that it's ironic?  Someone, Wicklin said, Wicklin is now saying that someone is, someone who was at the show  said Corgan was a fan.  Oh, wow.  He left that part out when he wrote me an email. 
[02:30:30]  Gotcha.  He left that part out.  Oh, he wasn't at the show.  What?  He wasn't even at the show?  He wasn't even at the show?  I wasn't at the show.  Someone who was at the show said Corgan was a fan.  Holy shit, I swear to you.  His email said that he's a big fan of your show.  Oh, my God.  God, I love it.  The way Don put it, Billy Corgan was running behind reporters yelling,  Opie and Anthony!  Opie and Anthony!  Right.  Look at this.  Where is that sweet little Wicklin? 
[02:31:00]  Hey, can you play the Stephen Lynch Smashing Pumpkins song?  We haven't played it in a while.  Don't worry.  It's like 20 seconds long or something.  You got it?  Yeah.  Where the f**k are my car keys?  They were right here in my hand.  I had them just a second ago. 
[02:31:30]  Did I leave them in the kitchen?  Or underneath the cushions of the couch?  I can't find them anywhere.  Any-  Oh, here they are.  See?  That'll get them calling.  With a lawsuit.  By the way, what happened to our phone?  Are you in panic mode, E-Rock? 
[02:32:00]  Yes.  Why?  What's the matter?  Oh, no.  Poor E-Rock.  Really?  Crashed?  What happened?  Were you calling the small hat store?  He just threw his hat in the garbage.  As he should have.  What's up with the small hats?  They're tiny.  Yes, they are.  Hello, small hats.  I have a tough time finding hats that fit my head, so I just don't wear hats.  Eric doesn't.  Don't adjust it.  Let him try.  They're not small hats.  If you'll notice, he only has hats that little dolls have.  Like, he has a f**king plastic cowboy.  I don't want that shit after you threw it in the garbage. 
[02:32:30]  You take loads on your chest for trying his f**king hat on.  Hold on, excuse me.  What do you mean loads?  Do you mean shit?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't even cum.  All right.  First of all, you're picking it up the way f**king Sergeant Hartman picked up the donut  and full metal jacket.  He's holding it from the little ball on the top.  What the f**k is that?  A tiny hat?  Are tiny hats allowed in the barracks?  Sir, no, sir.  Are you allowed to wear a tiny hat?  Sir, no, sir.  And why is that, Private E-Rock?  Because I have a little head, sir. 
[02:33:00]  E-Rock just shushed me, so.  All right, there you go.  Wow.  What's he called?  The f**king Eric and Anthony show?  Brad, he just, he just.  Damn.  He just has a shoulder like, get out of my way.  You don't shush the boss.  The boss shushes you.  You're running over here for.  I asked you to move over so I could turn the phone.  Yeah, why don't you just slap Mopey in the face?  Jesus.  Why are you so hurtful?  They're paying for it.  You wear it.  Plus, all summer long, the K-Rock Scalper hooks you up with tickets to the biggest shows.  Nice. 
[02:33:30]  Pipes, and bark.  Rage against the machine.  Corn.  You better see us.  Nickelback.  And don't forget the smoke box.  Tickets cover summer.  Keep listening to win your tickets.  Listen live on the web at 923krock.com.  Lock 923 on your radio.  K-Rock.  K-Rock.  No free tickets?  This one goes out to all the potheads out there.  It's 923 K-Rock.  Light them up if you have them.  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  Rockin'.  It's funny.  They brought me Eric's hat, so I threw it here and it went right back in the garbage.  Yeah.  And of course, fucking Rage Fan walks over and takes his big, long, fucking cock-weight-down  leg and just steps on it in the trash can.  And then fucking stupid takes it back out and saves it.  Fucking Vic Morrow can't let go of his hat. 
[02:34:30]  You're right.  Why?  Why the small hats?  It's not a small hat.  I will put it on.  I guarantee you it doesn't fit me.  Proof icon.  Oh, no.  There goes Jimmy into the bathroom and it's in the toilet.  Wait, wait.  You better give him a mic.  Oh, it's in the toilet.  Oh, brother.  Hold on.  What the hell's going on in there?  Oh, no.  Jimmy's hat.  I'll put that door open.  E-Rock's got Jimmy's hat and...  It's not my hat. 
[02:35:00]  It's young Eric's hat.  Oh, he's pissing in it.  And I threw him in the toilet.  Oh, you hear it hitting?  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  What's hope you're doing?  Uh-oh.  Hope he might be gearing up.  Wow. 
[02:35:30]  Don't flush, Jimmy.  Oh, I won't.  Don't flush.  He can't.  He shouldn't.  Oh, God.  You make a clog.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Is the opening to the hat facing up or is the top of the hat facing up?  Oh, yeah.  The opening?  Oh, so...  Don't talk to the door open, you fucking sicko.  I was going to fill it?  That's right.  Oh, fill that hat up with something more productive than I was filling it ten minutes ago.  He called you a piece of shit worse than a piece of shit. 
[02:36:00]  Oh.  Don't hurt yourself.  How great would he be?  Rip something.  Yeah, just bludged.  His hat's all bloody.  That guy has white Eric hair.  The fucking guy I've seen on...  Turn on MSNBC fucking E-Rock when he's 60.  It's like if E-Rock and Jack Lord fucked.  Oh!  Oh, is it hurting?  I'm trying to force one out.  Don't.  It never works that way.  Just relax.  Just relax.  Take a deep breath.  Let that shit just fall out. 
[02:36:30]  Ugh.  Oh, big fucking...  Yeah, big blood-filled hat from Opie's ass.  Ugh.  Anything coming out?  I'm turtling.  Aw, that's bad.  You're going to be fucked all day now.  You can't...  You can't go up half-cocked when you've got to take a shit.  Ugh.  You can't do that.  All right, you guys talk about something else for a minute.  No, now it's very...  I'm kind of captivated.  Ugh!  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God!  I might pass out. 
[02:37:00]  No, don't pull in Elvis.  That's how Elvis died, you know.  Forcing out one of those big fucking peanut butter and banana shits.  All right, say something soothing.  Well, Ope, Dre from Whack Bag is on the feedback saying,  A big boy made a hattie.  Jimmy, talk me through this.  Just relax.  What I'll always do is take your hands and brush them gently on your nipples  and just, like, zone out.  You and your nipples when you're fucking, when you're shitting,  when you're doing everything. 
[02:37:30]  I'm telling you, it relaxes me.  No.  It makes me a better person.  You know, bend your legs a little.  All right.  Yeah.  Pull them up to your midsection.  Don't think you're shitting into the hat of an eager boy.  Who's shitting into an eager boy's hat.  So you went in there expecting too much.  You can't expect too much when you're going to take a dump.  That's great.  Fucking pissing and shitting in his hat.  Couldn't be happier.  Go shitting your hat.  How's the...  Go shitting your hat.  Yeah, go shitting your hat.  There's language for your mother. 
[02:38:00]  Anything?  Yeah, it's kind of...  All right.  Shh.  Shh.  Come on, come on.  Rub your stomach.  And...  Oh, come on.  You know what also works?  What?  You got to...  Which sucks, but you got to slam your asshole shut and start anew.  Are you kidding?  Sometimes if you let it suck back in... 
[02:38:30]  Suck it back up.  And then you got to shoot it back out.  It's like reloading a howitzer.  Yeah, picture a dog if he doesn't know he's turned on or not.  Yeah.  It kind of comes in and then goes back.  Yeah, yeah.  How would you know that?  I don't know.  We all speak German.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Ah.  Does that staring into a light help?  I think that's sneezing.  That's sneezing, yeah.  And Rolf, Netherlands, this is quality radio.  You son of bitch.  Yeah, we're doing...  From the Netherlands. 
[02:39:00]  Go find better radio in the Netherlands.  You fucking...  What do they call them?  Ned.  You Ned.  Ned lover.  I got one.  You fucking whitey.  Go shit in your hat.  Yeah.  The Netherlands.  Anyone else want to try this?  No.  I might be failing miserably.  Who wants to sit on the toilet after your warm cheeks have just been there?  I tinkled on it, but...  Danny, do you have to shit?  I wish.  Got words for you, Netherlands.  How about you, Eric?  No.  Why don't you go there and drop a deuce in that hat? 
[02:39:30]  Fucking teach yourself a lesson.  Sam?  You want to go take a Gerber shit?  A fucking little shit that smells like applesauce?  Jimmy, that line made a little raisin that pop.  Oh, good.  Oh.  Plink.  It's like a little fucking hard one.  I got a little plank.  It's like shitting a tumor.  You know what's kind of disgusting there, O?  What?  If you let out like a milk dud and you get splashed back, you're going to get Jimmy's  piss up your asshole.  Yep. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah?  That's right.  Yeah.  I got nothing.  Wow.  What's fucking worse, though?  What's worse than when you break off a piece and you fucking...  There's nothing worse than sucking back in half a log.  Yeah.  Nothing worse.  You got to snap it off with your own sphincter muscle.  Oh, it's the worst.  And you know cleanup's just going to be a bitch.  Yeah.  Oh.  What was that?  He probably put the thing down to wipe because he did plink one out.  He's trying.  Well, we'll leave the hat there and then we'll see who wants to go to the bathroom. 
[02:40:30]  Why don't you talk to him?  Oh, I think success?  It's...  It's...  It's...  It's funnier than success.  Oh, because it's just like a nugget?  Yeah.  Is it floating in his hat?  Jimmy.  I don't want to walk in there and look at...  Jimmy.  Just look at him.  No, you got to take a picture.  It doesn't smell.  I didn't even think I got anything done.  Video thing, man. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  It looks like someone took the tail of a Manx cat and fucking threw it in there.  What a little rotten...  By the way, for artistic purposes, I got to go wipe somewhere else.  Oh, God.  He didn't wipe.  Ew.  He's fucking stiff-legging.  You should have wiped it and threw it on his hat and then made him wear it.  So you want your job?  Put this on.  Then made him dance around and do a fucking wet hat dance.  Why would we get Jared and his duty hat?  And first of all, dumbbells, D-O-O-D-Y.  D-Y.  It's spelled right there.  D-O-O-T-Y. 
[02:41:30]  You think Jared would put on that hat?  How much money you got?  I got a couple hundred.  You think Jared would put on that...  That's a real duty hat.  Let me answer it, Jared.  It's a P-P-N duty hat.  No.  All right, here comes Jared.  Come on in, Jared.  You're like hunched over.  Oh, my God.  What, are you always carrying heavy things in your right pocket?  Yeah.  It's like you're carrying a heavy suitcase.  Stop lugging around weights. 
[02:42:00]  How you doing?  All right.  Your duty hat is right behind you.  The paper one.  Yeah.  Very cute and adorable.  And you did actually pick up Jimmy's duty with your hand.  Yes, that's right.  Now, we have something going on here.  Look in the bathroom and look in the toilet and see what's in there and describe it on  the microphone that is in there.  Pick up the mic.  Take your time, Jared.  Give us a good description of what's going on.  There is a hat.  Yeah.  And there is a turd in the hat. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  And what else?  Anything with the water?  There's water in the hat, too.  Yeah.  Is the water clear?  I can't tell because the hat is dark.  Oh, okay.  So, you don't know if the water is clear, water, or yellow water, or anything like that?  No.  I'm going to assume it's piss, though.  A little bit.  Okay.  Just a little bit.  What would it take for you to take that hat out of that toilet and put it on your head 
[02:43:00]  and wear it?  A hundred bucks.  No.  Less than a hundred?  No.  I'm going to say...  What would it take?  Now, how much did it take for you to pick up the duty out of the duty bowl?  $300.  $300.  That's a whole bunch of duty.  We're not even asking.  You got to just take the hat out of the bowl and plop it on your head.  I'm offering you $100. 
[02:43:30]  No, I'm not doing that.  No, I'll offer $150 for you to put that hat on your head.  You just got to reach in and put that hat on your head.  It's a real live duty hat.  Oh, my God.  No.  I want to see the water just run down your head for $200.  $200 for that.  I'll throw in $50.  $250.  $250. 
[02:44:00]  Higher?  Well, you could keep saying higher until we reach a point where I'm not going to do it.  Don't look at me.  I contributed already.  You're passing up $250.  This is yours.  Let me give you $300.  We're going $250.  No.  And that's a lot of money.  Sam.  What do you do?  What are you making this week?  How much money?  About $100.  About $100.  So it's $250.  That's two and a half weeks.  No. 
[02:44:30]  He's really disturbed by it.  All right.  Here it is.  The final offer is what you got last time.  All right.  $300.  Oh, my God.  $300 to put that hat on your head.  And it's not stewy like Jimmy's.  No.  It's a nugget.  Trust me, man.  That was a tough one.  That is as solid as they come.  Oh, I don't want to do that.  He's all freaked out.  Sam's really selling it.  And an Alec Baldwin Best of SNL. 
[02:45:00]  Wow.  Price closet.  Alec Baldwin Best of SNL.  And $300 to put on that hat.  No.  That is now residing in the toilet bowl with one of Opie's nuggets in it.  Sitting in a pool of Jimmy's piss.  I have a thing about my head.  It's huge.  It is more than a nugget, by the way.  What thing do you have about your head?  It's about a four-incher.  Is it a four-incher?  I don't usually like wearing hats.  Well.  Why?  Do you like to show off that smart hairdo? 
[02:45:30]  No.  I just...  No.  So there is no price to be paid that would get you to put that hat on?  Oh, God.  Well, I would need a lot of disinfectant.  I'm going to go wash all my hands.  Are you going to get $300 worth of disinfectant?  I'm going to shave my head or something.  Karen, let's put it this way.  You do this, you take the $300 Roonies, and you can go home.  Oh.  Forever.  Can you have more time?  I've got audio I've got to edit, though. 
[02:46:00]  And if you don't do it, you don't get the $300, and you still go home.  Still get to go home.  I don't know if we can force someone.  There might be a human resource this year.  Yeah, that probably is.  We're forcing someone to wear a shithat.  Yeah, it's a shithat.  But we can try to broaden it.  How's he going to do this?  Drain the water, but keep the duty in the hat?  Yeah, what's the whole thing?  You pick up the hat with your thumb and forefinger.  By the brim.  By the brim.  Keeping everything that's in the hat in the hat. 
[02:46:30]  And then you flip it onto your head.  That's right.  And when you put the duty hat on, you turn around, and you put your arms out, and you  go, huh?  Huh?  I'm wearing a duty hat.  I'm wearing a duty hat, is what you say.  And then your mission is accomplished, and you get $300.  Sam's yelling at him.  And pull it out.  Here it is.  What's up, Sam?  Dr. Steve is in for $100.  Wow.  Everyone is saying, I love $50,000, Anthony.  One, two.  You've got to win more often at the blackjack table. 
[02:47:00]  They're loving your $50,000.  $300 is right here.  And my $50.  My $50, too.  Oh, oh, oh.  Then I'll take back $100 and put in $250, and that's $300.  I don't want him doing more than $300.  That is it.  That's what he did last time.  That is your final offer.  Yeah, I know.  I've got to go to the casino and win.  It makes the show more fun.  I'm going to learn a casino business. 
[02:47:30]  That's good radio.  I just did the Fredo skip.  The Fredo skip when he lets Michael into the room.  He was wearing duty hats, two at a time.  Players couldn't take a shit at the table.  Can I get, like, shampoo or something?  Yes.  Mike, you don't walk into Las Vegas and shit in a man like Mo Green's hat like that.  Yeah, somebody go to the store and get him some fucking, uh...  You don't give me a duty hat.  I give you a duty hat.  Lots of disinfectant and shampoo.  Okay.  Disinfectant and shampoo. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  And for $300, you'll put on the duty hat.  The authentic duty hat.  A hat full of duty.  That's true.  Wow.  You are becoming duty boy.  I'm becoming the scat man.  You are.  No, I like duty boy.  I say the traveling virus show.  We have him run across the stage with a duty boy mask and cape and then just...  Oh.  How funny.  And then his arms stretch straight out as duty boy.  Duty boy.  Are we doing this or what? 
[02:48:30]  Or what?  Yes, Dr. Steve said he was in for $100.  Wow.  Okay, so that's $400.  That's something.  Four.  Get a receipt.  Damn.  Get a receipt.  Get a receipt.  All right.  What do you think?  That's good.  As we're putting a shit hat on somebody, we're taxed and fiscally responsible.  I'm getting a thumbs up from camera boy.  All right.  What do I got to say again?  You got to put the duty...  He's worried about his lines.  You got to drain the water out.  Put the duty hat on.  And then you have to look at the camera and go, huh? 
[02:49:00]  Shouldn't he say something about I'm wearing a duty hat?  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah, he should actually say, we got to get the whole thing on video.  Him picking it up.  And then you're going to have to tilt your head down over the toilet.  And it's going to have to be a pretty good flip because you're going to need what would  amount to some type of...  Is that centrifugal force?  Is it just inertia?  Yeah, inertia.  In order to keep that nugget in the hat. 
[02:49:30]  It's not a nugget.  As it slaps down on your head.  You haven't looked at it.  Go look at it.  It's a foreign shirt.  Let me take a look.  Go look at the dude.  Anthony's actually going to look?  Yeah.  It doesn't smell.  Wow, this is unorthodox.  It literally is the perfect duty for this stunt.  It has a tiny little friend.  That was the Raisinette that popped out. 
[02:50:00]  That is pathetic.  It's like the Oliver Twist of shit.  It's an exclamation point.  Oh, it's sad.  It's like a comma.  It's like your asshole is making a statement, and that's the pause for a second.  Oh, is that terrible?  What an awful little shit.  It really is.  The runt shit.  All right.  All right.  What are we doing?  Fucking red nose on it.  Is he game?  Here he goes.  Okay, he's done.  I hate this.  All right, now, get a good video of this. 
[02:50:30]  Now, what you're going to have to do is bend over the toilet a little bit.  Sam, you've got to get the video first so they don't think it's fake.  And flip it up.  Now, there might be some spatter when he flips.  Oh, my God.  So, look out.  I would drain the hat over the bowl before you go.  Yeah, drain the hat of most of the liquid.  Yeah.  And then, yeah, you're videotaping, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  So, you understand.  Someone hold the mic in there. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  I've got to drain the hat.  Yeah, pick up the hat.  Let the liquid drain out for the most part.  You know, it's still going to be a wet hat.  And then do this.  Bend over, like, 90 degrees, like that, and then flip it onto your head so the duty stays in there.  And make sure you flip it on.  Yes.  And then stand up and go, oh, boy, a duty hat.  Oh, yeah.  That's your line.  Oh, boy, a duty hat.  And then I do, ah, ah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, boy, a duty hat.  No, he has to say that as he sees it.  He looks at it and he goes, oh, boy, a duty hat.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  And then you put it on your head and you put your arms out and you go, thanks, Ma.  I don't know.  Some people hated this bit last time we did it.  Yeah.  How could they have?  They don't like the duty bit.  I say fuck them.  Yeah, because the whole process is funny. 
[02:52:00]  I know.  All right.  All right.  All right, Jared.  So.  We ready?  All right.  You got the camcorder going.  Make sure you got a picture of what's in there.  Fuck.  Now, move your lines, Jared.  All right.  What happened?  Wait, what happened?  He cursed.  What happened?  I didn't curse, but you could curse.  I don't know.  I'd be a real shithead.  Get it.  No.  Wow.  Hence the reason why he has to do stuff like this.  Yeah.  Now, Jared, let's go over those lines.  Terrific. 
[02:52:30]  Yep.  You see the hat and go.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  And then you put it on.  You put your arms out.  What do you go?  Thanks, Ma.  Thanks, Ma.  Really?  No, maybe not.  Thinking.  Okay.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  Can we do something else?  Just throw it on.  I kind of like that.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  I like that dramatic.  Like, it's vaudeville.  Okay.  Ah.  Ah.  You want it to go, ah?  Is this a duty hat?  I just like the, ah. 
[02:53:00]  Just, ah.  Like, aren't you impressed?  I want to see the $300.  Oh, we're not good for it?  What do you think?  We're fucking, ah.  It's motivation.  And first of all, it's $400, because Steve's going to send a hundred.  Steve is sending a hundred.  Four hundred bucks.  Three hundred.  And he's good for his hundred.  Yes, he's a doctor.  Yes.  Good man.  I think you could say this is better than, ah.  I think you could safely say this is better than 10,000 marbles.  Yeah.  This is our bit for Marble Madness Monday.  Duty hat.  To celebrate the Phillies' 10,000 loss. 
[02:53:30]  Yes.  They should be forced to play all season with fucking hats with shit in them.  All right.  You could smell like the Philly Fanatic.  Yeah, that thing stunk.  Fucking sucks.  All right.  I think we're ready.  All right.  Are we ready?  Sam, make sure you get a nice video shot of what's going on in there.  We want everything.  Because no one's going to buy into this if they see a cutaway.  He's starting to, like, hit his own head.  Yeah, he's really upset by this.  All right.  A lot of people say you should practice with a fresh hat just to make sure he gets it right. 
[02:54:00]  No, I think we should just go for the take.  All right.  Let's go for the take.  Go for the take.  So, Jared, what's your line?  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  And then.  Then you put it on.  And then let's see your.  That's good.  That is good.  Okay.  Now, remember, let some of the water drain out.  Let's get a good look.  It's on the OPAN 2 camera on Pal Talk right now.  What the fuck are we doing?  Making him wear a duty hat for money. 
[02:54:30]  All right.  For money.  All right.  All right.  He's bent over.  He's looking a little peaked as far as this goes.  All right.  Ready?  Here he goes.  Remember your line.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  There you go.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Oh, cut.  I like that.  Cut.  I like that.  Cut.  I like that.  Because what happened was you got to get Sam to get the video.  Then you pop up.  And he paused.  And trust me, let's just do it again.  And plus, I don't want it to.  I want it to be like, oh, boy. 
[02:55:00]  A duty hat.  You've just found.  You wrote Santa.  Yeah.  And you've just found a duty hat.  Is that what I.  That's my motivation.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  Yeah.  You're excited.  You had to make one last time.  God has provided you with a real one.  Be grateful.  Washington State checking in.  KP.  Oh, this is definitely better than a nice wiffle ball challenge done by hot chicks. 
[02:55:30]  Feel the sarcasm?  Thank you.  Oh, that was sarcastic?  I didn't get it.  All right.  All right.  He's preparing.  I'm going to watch it on Pal Talk here.  I got a better view than I do here in the studio.  What do you got?  Here we go.  And action.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  Wait, what? 
[02:56:00]  No, no.  What the hell was that?  Mr. Ed?  Oh, boy.  A duty hat, Wilbur.  What happened to your acting?  It was perfect.  All right.  It's got to be how you said it the last time.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  Kind of has that.  You're excited.  You're a boy.  Like this.  Yeah.  Jimmy, give him the line.  Repeat after Jimmy so you get it.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  Jesus.  Go ahead.  Jimmy's making fists, but his hands are shaking.  Oh, I know. 
[02:56:30]  He's great.  Jimmy's great.  Over the bowl.  All excited.  Give it a try now with that line.  Just try the line.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  What happened to your voice?  What happened to your voice?  Why can't you?  Why do you put that voice on?  What do you think?  You're not going to sound dumb enough in your regular voice?  You're mistaken.  What happened to, oh, boy.  A duty hat.  Isn't that?  Somebody's pointing out the only thing CBS will let us do in this studio is let them  play with shit. 
[02:57:00]  That's the stupidity of this.  Let's try it again.  But do your regular voice, Jared.  You have a sweet boy's voice.  Thank you.  Be genuinely excited.  You've gotten a duty hat you wanted.  Yeah.  They're not easy to find.  Places are always sold out.  All right.  Now, you're excited.  You're a young, excited boy on Christmas morning.  Right.  All right.  Let's see.  The line.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  What happened to him?  I don't know what that voice is that he puts on. 
[02:57:30]  I thought you guys wanted the Brian Regan thing.  No.  No.  No, we want you.  We want you.  Jared.  We want a young boy you on Christmas morning.  Are you the star of duty hat?  Unfortunately, yes.  Or a big boy makes a duty.  The duty hat series.  What was the voice you had in big boy makes a duty?  I guess it was kind of like a Brian Regan impression.  All right.  Do it.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  Yeah.  See, I don't like that.  No.  I like the real Jared.  What happened to him?  This is more reality TV.  Yeah, Jared.  Just do your regular voice. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  A duty hat.  But it's his regular voice.  Oh, boy.  Excited.  Pause a little.  Maybe even do your feet like this.  A duty hat.  Like this.  You have to be a voice.  Jimmy's going to show him something.  You're going to be like, oh, boy.  A duty hat.  You're going to do a little skip?  Yeah, you should do like the little jump.  Like, oh, boy.  A duty hat.  The scary part is it's great acting. 
[02:58:30]  But you can't not be excited.  You understand this is a duty hat.  It's 1988, and that's a Cabbage Patch doll.  They're very hard to come by.  Right.  Your parents went to Toys R Us and spent $500 on that for you.  Now, be grateful.  Okay.  Thank you.  Now, you're lying.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  That's getting there.  He can't.  That's a little better, though.  He can't do it.  It's a little better.  Unfortunately, we can't cast anybody else in this role.  No.  No one else will do this.  No, this is written for him. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  But he really can't get the line right.  No.  He's inept.  A horrible actor.  Should we blow it off?  What?  What?  Because he can't do the line.  No.  I'm depressed.  I think.  Give it another shot, Jared.  Oh, boy.  Very excited.  Oh, boy.  And then a little pause.  A duty hat.  Yeah, we hurry up.  The iron is leaking out of that duty as we speak.  It's white like one of the ones a dog leaves three weeks earlier.  One of the hard ones you kick on the lawn.  Iodine is escaping.  People are yelling, put the fucking hat on. 
[02:59:30]  They're all angry.  Go ahead, Jared.  Let's do it.  All right.  Well, get a shot of the Sam.  Start on the bowl and then pan up.  And let's go for a take here.  Here we go.  And action.  Oh, boy.  A duty hat.  Here he goes.  It's reaching in. 
[03:00:00]  He's getting some of the water out.  He's getting some of the water out.  He's getting the E-Rog hat.  The duty's in there.  Here he goes with the flip.  The flip.  He's admiring his gift.  Come on.  Flip that on.  This is even the...  This could be the best thing.  Oh, no.  Here it goes.  Keep going.  Keep filming.  This is perfect.  He just doesn't know if he's doing this.  He's looking into it.  Come on, now.  He's drained all the water in here.  Come on.  Duty hat time.  I think it's blonde hair.  Come on.  Duty hat time.  Come on.  Wait, he improvs. 
[03:00:30]  I don't like the improv.  No, put you...  Oh.  Does he have shit in his hair?  No, he didn't put the hat squarely on his head.  You didn't put the hat on.  I'm not fucking accepting that.  Why?  You got to put that hat on and pull the rim down.  Pull that rim down and not ta-da.  It's not the aristocrats.  Exactly.  What the fuck are you doing?  You missed your line.  Yeah.  Is the duty still in the hat?  Of course it is.  We're ready for another take.  All right.  Get it back.  Come on, now.  Just make sure that he...  A piece did fall out. 
[03:01:00]  Make sure he...  Make sure he puts it on.  Make sure he...  Yeah.  That's fucking...  All right.  That's fucking hat, Brim.  You got to pull the brim down a little bit and put it on and then go, uh, uh...  Huh?  Huh?  That's the line.  You put your arms out and go, huh?  Don't look like you're rushing to get through this.  Absolutely.  This is a gift you've been waiting for.  Yes.  All right.  Are we ready for take two?  He's placing the... 
[03:01:30]  Uh...  Hold on, Danny.  Get out of the way because we're going to...  Danny, uh...  Talking to Dan, getting some pre-game prep.  Continuity?  Continuity?  Is it all set where it was?  It is.  It's all set the way it was?  All right.  He didn't get anything in his hair.  Yeah.  No.  Jared, you got to just pull it down...  The brim down.  Pull the brim down.  Come on.  Like you're ready to go do something.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, boy!  A duty hat!  All right.  He's draining the hat. 
[03:02:00]  He's draining the hat.  On take two, he's draining the hat.  And...  Now pull the brim down.  Pull that brim down.  No, he did it!  Oh, my God!  Oh, shit!  Oh, Dan just...  Jeff, Dan just hit him on top of the head.  Holy shit!  Oh, God!  Does he have a duty head?  Does he have a duty head? 
[03:02:30]  There's less in the hat.  Hey, Jared!  Peek out!  Now put your head down!  He's got a duty head!  Can I get something to clean my head out?  I have a shotgun.  Oh, my God!  Oh, God!  I need some, too. 
[03:03:00]  We get a razor if he wants to shave his head.  Yeah, give him his thing.  Give him the stuff that he is.  Dude, my ribs hurt.  I can't breathe.  Hey, it's duty head.  If he wants to shave his head, tell him we got a razor.  Oh, Dan.  I didn't think you were going to do it.  No.  He smacked it down in his head.  And then he mushed it.  He gave him the mush.  He certainly did.  That hat fit well.  He's trying to wash it.  A lot of duty in his hair?  What does it look like?  Oh, that's good.  Oh, that beautiful blonde hair. 
[03:03:30]  What happened?  Jesus Christ.  His golden locks.  Looks like someone spilled custard in...  Oh, fuck.  I fucked up.  Oh, no.  Custard.  I was going to say pudding in General Custard's beard, but I fucked up.  I've Custard in General Pudding's beard.  Night out on a dog.  You have no sense of humor.  I'm an asshole.  Do you want to shave your head?  No.  You sure?  A lot of duty in there.  No. 
[03:04:00]  How about 50 bucks more to shave your head?  Oh, no.  How, like, how shave?  I don't know.  I just get, like, a clipper.  No, it's wet.  You can't get to do it.  Yeah?  Well, it's going to wash out.  Like skinhead, uh, skinhead type of shave.  No.  Do you have shampoo over there?  Shampoo.  You know, I agree with Dave from Massachusetts.  Why?  Derek! 
[03:04:30]  You go, Derek!  Derek, you washed that shit out of your hair!  I washed that shit right out of my hair.  And then he told two friends.  And he told two friends.  And so on.  And so on.  And I want to thank Eric for, for, for inspiring that by, by doing normally, I don't know where 
[03:05:00]  I'm going with this.  I was implying that you're a shit.  Yes.  Jamie, Jamie.  Jerry.  Can you get the money?  Yes.  What?  Can you get the money now?  What money?  Well, your hands are dry.  Yeah.  Wash the shit out of your hair first.  Give the money, Sam.  What kind of a shampoo did you use?  On silk.  Yeah.  Head and anus. 
[03:05:30]  Thank you, Dan.  Head and shitters.  I don't know where to go.  All right.  We'll take a break.  You all right, Jared?  Yeah, I'll live.  Is that your hair color?  Or is there a brown streak of shit in your hair?  That's my hair color.  Okay.  You sure?  Yeah.  I was a little scared.  You got all the duty out of your hair.  Not yet.  Got a shampoo a few more times.  He just loves duty.  What? 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, I'll get it out.  I'll get it out.  Oh, no.  I won't get it out of my head.  No.  But you're going to shave it.  You're going to be gone.  Yeah, you should just shave your head.  Yeah, you probably should just shave your head.  Then you just take a fucking, like, washcloth and soap over it, and you're done.  It grows back.  I will not.  It grows back.  Oh, wow.  What's the matter?  You got one of those fucking, uh...  I guess we see where it's lined.  One of those birthmarks on there?  I gave myself an Uncle Paul fucker.  Remember Danny cut my hair and gave me the Uncle Paul?  Oh, was that great?  The big bolts. 
[03:06:30]  You made yourself horseshoe bolt.  All right, we'll continue the show.  Jared is washing his hair for the fifth time.  Could someone just plug up that sink and drown him in it?  He's a good boy, Jared.  He is.  Did we flush the toilet?  Did we get rid of the hat?  He's got, like, this fucking fixation with shit, though.  I don't understand.  All right.  All right, it's, uh...  What?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:07:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, we're back.  Jared is still, uh, washing his hair in the background.  It was really funny.  There was an exchange between Jared and Sam.  Sam brought Jared to the Opie and Anthony Show.  And, uh, what was the conversation, Anthony?  Jared was like, but I really do want to learn stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  He was teaching...  He was talking about pulling clips.  And, uh...  What happened, Sam? 
[03:07:30]  Apparently he's, you know...  I think he likes his position here, but he wants a little more.  We're not going to do it justice, but it was really funny listening to this.  And he didn't know that we were listening in.  What was it, Sam?  Well, he came up to me and he said...  I told him he was doing great.  And he said, well, you never had to do this stuff.  And I said, I was busy doing other stuff.  And he was like, yeah.  I told him I was pulling audio and stuff.  And he was like, uh...  Well, I'd really like to do that, too.  And I was like, you're kind of busy doing what it is that you're doing here.  And he said, well, can you teach me?  I really would like to learn how to do something. 
[03:08:00]  And, Jared, you said that you're willing to film a trilogy?  I was being facetious.  Oh.  But, uh, I guess I really...  And admit to everybody that you volunteered to do that.  We didn't force you or nothing.  It's for the cold, hard cash.  It's for the cold, hard cash.  Jared, you got soap in your hair.  Yeah, you might want to...  Ew.  It's not as bad as what you just had, but...  You might want to rinse out the soap a little bit.  Hey, um, do you have bit ideas and stuff like that?  Uh, to a certain extent and stuff like that. 
[03:08:30]  Oh.  You should bring them all to us, man.  I told one of the other interns that, too.  Bring us bit ideas.  It might be awful.  It might be good.  You've got an in now because you've done some things that we feel maybe we owe you.  All right, let the kid continue shampooing.  I like the fact that Jared wants to learn stuff.  I respect that.  He's like, let me...  I don't want to just sit around and do nothing.  I'm here for a reason.  Good for you.  Uh, let's say hi to Dominic in Rochester.  Dominic, what's up?  What's going on, ONA?  Yo, Jimmy, what's up, brother?  Welcome aboard, Dom.  What, buddy?  I said, thanks for coming out to Rochester. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, you're welcome.  I had fun.  Kenny is a douchebag.  Let me tell you.  I asked him to sign my book.  I told him in a little spot right there to sign your name.  He says, oh, no, I'll sign it down here.  What's up with that joke?  I wouldn't exactly say him signing where you didn't want him to makes him a douchebag.  There's so many other reasons.  Like, the fact that we had...  I forgot to mention this.  We had the hotel problems.  Can we get Kenny on the phone?  Thank you, Dominic.  With that stupid Hyatt.  Kenny is the worst when he argues with the manager. 
[03:09:30]  Because he starts saying, like, fucking fat housewife things.  Like, we're downstairs.  And, like, I was okay.  When the guy told us the rooms weren't reserved, I'm like, Kenny, let's just relax.  We're only here for 12 hours.  Let's just go upstairs and relax.  When I saw those Murphy beds, I went ballistic.  Yeah.  I mean, I laid into this manager.  I'm like, you fucking lied to us.  I mean, they had the manager there plus three other guys.  They had four guys there.  Like, he was worried because Kenny's 6'8".  And then Kenny starts saying stuff like, you know, there's a satisfaction guarantee by American Express. 
[03:10:00]  He uses, like, lines like that.  Oh, my God.  He says, like, you know, satisfaction is supposed to be guaranteed.  The customer is always right.  I swear to God, he throws out the worst.  You know how he blanks with the cliches?  You know, it's a bird in the hand.  We get it.  Kenny.  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  Hi, Kenny.  What's up, Kenny?  I'm just going over your awful dissatisfaction guarantee line you threw out at the fucking idiot 
[03:10:30]  manager at the Hyatt.  Well, I'm really embarrassed that that happened, Jim.  And, you know, I like to make things nice for you.  No, no, no.  It's not your fault, Kenny.  I'm saying.  No one Kenny takes everything seriously, too.  He probably tried to beat himself up with the Murphy bed, just slamming it on his head.  Oh, why?  But it wasn't Kenny's fault.  Kenny, it wasn't Kenny's fault.  He did the right thing.  He made the calls.  But I'm saying if the lines you throw out, like. 
[03:11:00]  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  I was done.  No, I did make Jimmy laugh with the Murphy bed, because when I pulled it out of the  wall, it slammed on the floor.  Aren't you glad you called me?  No.  No, I actually mentioned that before, and it did get a big laugh.  I talked about that earlier.  Oh, I wasn't listening.  I'm sorry.  Did you hear Jared putting on the duty hat?  Yes, that I heard, and that's good for him. 
[03:11:30]  And I'm glad it got smashed in his hair.  That's good for him.  Yeah.  Use a few dollars.  Well, dog shit sniffer from Woodside.  The price of Jimmy's book is insane.  No, it's not.  It's very reasonable.  That's what.  Well, he was just saying that you use these weird.  But, like, you do say things like, you know, we've paid with American Express, and there's  a satisfaction guarantee.  You know, a penny saved is a penny earned. 
[03:12:00]  Well, you know, it was a touchy situation, so we were just, you know, and Jimmy handled  it a lot better than I did, because he's very articulate, and he laid it out to the  guy, and, you know, he proved to the guy that he was a schmuck.  Yeah, I did kind of really give him a fucking earful.  I was on a roll.  Good.  Were you?  Yeah.  There's no such thing as a comfortable Murphy bed.  They're awful.  It's like, this is a fucking Hyatt, dude.  This is not like a shit, like a Motel 8. 
[03:12:30]  A bed's supposed to be big and heavy.  That's how it's comfortable.  Not the way you can pick it up and throw it into a wall.  You're not going to get a nice, big, thick mattress if it could fit in a hotel fucking wall.  But the fact that at the fucking Hyatt, they actually give you a room, which is really  the suite living room, when there's a real suite being given out, like, that's, they'll  just, it's not a bedroom.  No.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Kenny.  They had all kind of excuses, and the guy was trying to be slick, but Jimmy let him have 
[03:13:00]  it.  That guy.  Jimmy put him in his place.  That guy.  Jimmy wasn't going to have none of that.  That guy, he had that stupid manager smugness.  You know that company guy smile, those fucking douchebags all put on their faces until you  really start burying them, and then you see their smile wavering, because they're men,  and they want to act like men and just communicate honestly. 
[03:13:30]  I even said that to him.  I'm like, why didn't you just talk to us like men and tell us that there's fucking Murphy  beds there?  This is a Hyatt.  You're putting us in a fucking Murphy bed?  Yeah.  Put me on an army cot, you fuck.  Ugh.  Yeah, no.  The company men.  Jimmy was very comfortable in the handicap room they gave him.  I was.  I stood up in the shower and just tap danced, because I got legs.  Hey, we got a Jared bit in front of us, so we should let Kenny go.  All right, Kenny.  Thank you, Kenny.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry for bringing the show down. 
[03:14:00]  You didn't bring it down.  I just wanted to mention your awful little platitudes.  Here's a Jared bit, skit idea.  Okay, it starts with the music playing.  Should we explain this bit?  No, I think we should just do it.  All right.  Because it says here, Jared, the intern's bit, skit idea.  Let's just do it.  Is there any action?  All right.  Oh, I don't like that.  Yeah, let's just do it.  It says music is playing.  Opie brings us back from break.  Hey, we're back.  And in case you didn't know, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show with little Jimmy 
[03:14:30]  Norton on this beautiful Monday.  Woo-hoo!  Why are you so excited there, Jim?  Because of our next guest, Anthony.  He's a Frenchman.  Ah, yes.  A Frenchman from Paris, I would presume.  That's right.  His name is François Medera.  Right?  All right.  And he's the author of J'aimez la mortaire.  Right?  Which means I love the dead.  Can we bring him in here? 
[03:15:00]  Uh, Danny?  What a shock.  He's drunk when his lines are supposed to be fucking happening.  Where is he?  Where's Danny?  All right.  We got to get everyone in here.  Danny's in this.  Jim's in this.  Who's playing François?  No idea.  Uh, well, uh, Than.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock is François.  E-Rock!  Danny's got some lines.  Pull that mic over here.  Come on, Danny.  Young Dan.  Are you off book yet, Dan?  I wasn't aware I had lines.  Yeah, we weren't either.  I don't like my music.  All right, you want it?  All right, you want it? 
[03:15:30]  Just fucking with you.  I'll just use the K-Rock feed.  Three.  K-Rock.  Dr. E, what I want.  Oh, hold on.  There's more parts to be given out.  What?  Yeah, okay.  Uh, you're, Eric, you're François.  Yep.  And you're also Random Girl.  Get, yeah, you have a script up there.  Well, who does the best girl voice?  Eric.  Eric?  All right.  Yeah.  Well, no, Sam should be Random Girl.  Okay, Sam's Random Girl.  Just to get everyone involved.  Don't disagree at all. 
[03:16:00]  Sam, you're a Random Girl.  Like Danny's all tangled in the chair with his headphones.  Danny, not ready for his big part.  All right, are we ready?  Yeah.  This is an actual script.  It's a script that Jared turned in.  Is this a comedy?  Well, talk into the yellow mic.  Yeah, there's 10 mics in the studio.  Just grab another one.  It was originally a bit I had written for stand-up, but due to the fact that I have no confidence  whatsoever, I never did it, so it just stayed as an idea. 
[03:16:30]  But then I was asking tips from Sam, because Sam's great at stand-up.  Yes, yes.  I've seen him firsthand.  He's really good.  Whoa, whoa, wait.  You do stand-up comedy?  I have.  Ooh.  Stand-up comedy.  Can we, um...  He's done it once, and he forgot to tape it.  Oh.  Can I forget to tape it?  We'll tape it next time.  I didn't forget to tape it.  When did you do it?  I was in Syracuse.  Okay.  And I was just talking with Tony, and Tony pitched it to Sam, and I pitched to Sam, and 
[03:17:00]  Sam said, can you...  You know, shit makes a good hair dye.  Fucking...  You don't have to talk about this like it's gone with the wind.  Exactly.  Jesus Christ.  So we just asked you, like, is it a...  I asked, is it a comedy?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a comedy, but it was originally written for two people.  Okay.  And you decided to incorporate it into the show atmosphere.  I talked to Sam, and we couldn't get funding, so all the producers backed out, and the executive  producer had a problem in France.  He couldn't get a location because the union fees...  Shut your face! 
[03:17:30]  Got leaked onto YouTube.  Got leaked onto YouTube.  Exactly.  HBO, Sunday nights.  I wanted to be nominated for documentary, but they said this wasn't technically a documentary.  And then it all fell apart.  Everyone's saying, is this Richard McBeef?  Yeah.  I wish.  He's describing it like this is a fucking Hearts of Darkness documentary.  Why don't we just...  Why don't we just do it?  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Ah, we're back.  And in case you didn't know, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show with little Jimmy  Norton on this beautiful Monday. 
[03:18:00]  Oh!  Oh, why so excited, Jim?  Because our next guest, Anthony, he's a Frenchman.  Ah, yes.  A Frenchman from Pelley, I would presume.  That's right.  His name is Francois Medera, and he is the author of Jamais la Maté, which means I love  the dead.  Can we bring him in here?  Huh?  Uh, he refuses to come in.  What?  Yeah, he said he will not enter the studio.  He wants to do the interview from the green room.  Uh, okay. 
[03:18:30]  Let's get him mic'd up and a set of headphones.  And, Tim, I can tell already this is going to be a disaster.  He seems like a real tool.  Yeah, let's see how far we can push him.  This could be fun.  I have a feeling we're going to get calls from Yellowstone and Jersey.  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Welcome to the Open Anthony Show, Francois.  Good morning, sir.  How are you?  Is his headphones working? 
[03:19:00]  Why would they be working?  That's right.  This is a professional radio show.  Let's get someone on it or blame...  I'm going to blame E-Rock.  Ah, yes.  Good morning, my friends.  Today is such a glorious day, no?  Ah, oui.  Today is a glorious day.  You seem like a pretty cheerful person.  Why such a morbid title for your book?  You see, Opie?  I love everything.  I love life. 
[03:19:30]  I love women.  I love food.  Everything in this world, I love.  And I love to make love, too.  So, you're saying you make love to the dead.  Basically, you're a necrophilia.  That's right.  Not a necrophiliac.  A necrophilia.  I'm reading it verbatim.  My bad.  That is right, Opie.  And I will...  Why was Francois...  Never mind, go ahead.  Your line will explain that.  Okay.  All right.  That is right, Opie.  I will occasionally make love to the dead. 
[03:20:00]  But my name is Anthony.  So, Francois, in your book you say...  Make up a question impossible to answer.  Why is Eric always late?  That is right, little Anthony.  I am the world's greatest lover.  I can woo any woman.  And I please just by speaking French. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, Fran.  Okay, Francois, let's see what you got.  Dan, send one of the interns to get some random girl who works in the office.  They bring in a random girl into the green room.  Hello.  How are you?  I'm okay.  Now, ma'am, we're going to have you help us out here with our little experiment.  See, the guy standing next to you, he says he could woo any woman just by speaking French to her.  Are you going to be able to help us out?  Okay. 
[03:21:00]  You got a lot more lines.  Oh, keep going.  What are you crazy?  This is the best part of the whole thing.  All right, back up.  Read that whole thing, Francois.  All right, go back to random girl.  Go.  And then Anthony.  I'm okay.  I'm okay.  Now, ma'am, we're going to have you help us out with a little experiment.  See, the guy standing next to you, he says he could woo any woman just by speaking French to her. 
[03:21:30]  Will you help us out?  Okay.  Okay.  You are the scene of the squeak, but it's never sex.  I will hold your hair on your feet.  Your face wants to be a mess.  Uh, that's some of the most messed up things I've ever heard. 
[03:22:00]  What did he say?  In essence, you have great breasts and he likes sex.  He wants to pull your hair.  You make him vomit and he hopes you slip and crack your head open in a puddle of AIDS.  Oh, um, damn, I should have been ready on that one. 
[03:22:30]  Hold on, we'll have to play a drop here.  Damn it.  Uh, three.  Uh, should be.  Okay.  Let's see if we can find it there.  Um.  No.  Oh, come on.  There's a mic here.  Oh, there's a mic here.  Okay, here it is.  What's that supposed to be? 
[03:23:00]  Some kind of a sick joke?  My father.  Okay, let's go to the phones.  Let's go to Steve from Yellowstone.  Yeah.  Uh, Steve, you're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  See, I'm obsessed with flames.  I wear flame t-shirts almost every day.  Do you love flames?  Oui.  That's his ass.  Just keep talking this way around you.  It's the bit.  Yes, I like flame.  Ramon! 
[03:23:30]  Bring this man a plate of frog legs with a side of AIDS.  Ramon!  This guy is a complete ane du cheval, which is French for horse's ass.  Who is this Ramon?  He calls from time to time.  He's a very loyal listener with a weak chin.  That man insulted my honor.  How dare he?  I'm going to raise the white flag and admit defeat.  Okay, let's go to Jim from Jersey. 
[03:24:00]  Jim, you're on the air.  So, yeah, I was wondering how I can be like you.  See, I usually spend my evenings driving around my Saturn, which I had seven years ago, and trolling for hookers.  Hookers?  Yes, women who participate in the world's oldest profession.  Ah, well, my little friend, it's very simple.  Ramon!  Bring someone who is not Inspector Clouseau crack.  Ramon! 
[03:24:30]  Bring me a writer who comes up with original bits rather than rehash old ones.  Let's think.  Ramon!  Bring me an intern who doesn't attempt to save a shit sketch with inside references.  Ramon!  Sam was very convincing as a girl.  Ramon!  Ramon!  Now you know why he wore shit in a hat! 
[03:25:00]  Wars.  War.  War.  Let's take a break and regroup.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  And the curtain closes.  Scene.  Scene.  Wow.  This Jim Lestinx.  Chris from Monroe.  Lestinx.  Yeah, that was married.  What?  I don't...  What the?  I don't get it.  Like, I don't really get what the...  Where's the... 
[03:25:30]  Where's the point?  And the comedy?  And like, what is this about?  Where's the Hoosie Watsie?  I really don't know.  I was just told to come up with a sketch or a skit.  And that's the...  Something I came up with.  Oh.  Did other interns come up with skits?  No.  I...  What's...  Like...  Well, some have some ideas.  Was this trying to be an accurate depiction of the show?  Like, why...  This skit is kind of a bad version of what we would do with a bad guest. 
[03:26:00]  That's kind of...  That's where you're getting at, right?  Yeah, but you're not...  You haven't taken it anywhere, like, except made it worse than it would be if we just did  it ourselves.  Like, you're not...  Do you get what I mean?  Yeah, I got what you mean.  You didn't take it anywhere.  What is it?  I didn't really know what to do with it because it was originally just...  I know what to do with it.  Oh, no.  No, no, no. 
[03:26:30]  That is awful.  All right.  Wow.  Anybody else have anything?  I just wanted to know what joke you were going for when you said, Ramon, bring someone  who is not Inspector Clouseau crack.  I have no idea.  I wrote this for a while ago.  Did you forget the word on and go into the old on crack?  On crack, which is always funny.  Anything on crack, on steroids, on from hell.  Like a banshee?  Oh, always funny. 
[03:27:00]  I was told to write this for regular radio.  So what, you removed the humor for what, fucking NPR?  Yeah, pretty much.  We built this city on rock and roll.  Built this city.  All right, thanks, Jared.  Wow.  That's terrific radio today.  Girl dies in bungee jumping accident.  This is one of those stories where you have to question God.  There's no God.  You've got to question God when you see these stories pop up from time to time. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Also, authorities in Wisconsin trying to figure out what caused another deadly amusement park accident.  A 16-year-old was riding a bungee jumping attraction at a Christian music festival when it malfunctioned, sending her plunging at least 40 feet to the ground.  She died in surgery hours after her fall.  Police say they aren't sure if criminal charges will be filed.  Is that CW11?  I don't know.  There is no God.  There is no God. 
[03:28:00]  There is no God.  My name's Fred.  I'm a man like you.  Or a man just like you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got a question?  I mean, you know.  Yeah.  It was at some big Christian festival.  Christian music festival.  Right.  And what was the ride called?  Leap of Faith.  It was Leap of Faith.  Was it really?  No.  It had some kind of spiritual name.  It might have been Leap of Faith.  It's like one of these dumb friggin' carny rides that they give a spiritual name like you're, you know. 
[03:28:30]  I know what it was called.  It was called the Get to Heaven Early.  Yeah.  It's something like the...  The Tumbling Virgin.  I don't remember.  It's the Good Luck Bro.  But it was.  It's just a...  You know, if this was something where people could go to praise the Lord...  It was called Air Glory. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  Air Glory.  Air Glory.  Like, you're sweeping through the air and it's glorious because you're with Jesus.  By the way, the line is, and this is Redding from Whack Bag, God hates Christian rock too.  Oh.  Very good.  My.  That Christian rock sucks.  It does.  God does it suck.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  All righty.  And we'll come back and do line of the day and do a little mop-up.  Anything.  A little mop-up with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:29:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  Satellite.  Satellite Radio.  Satellite.  Satellite Radio.  Satellite Radio.  Yes.  Why?  Why am I bringing the show back?  Well, because Opie's completing what he did in the hat. 
[03:30:00]  That's right.  Before I would gather.  No?  Just a little leaky?  A little leaky?  You cleaning up any mess back there?  Was there any...  Dr. Leaky?  Dr. Leaky, I presume.  Dr. Leaky, I presume.  Yeah.  That's a script.  I didn't get it.  It was good.  All right.  This is awful.  Let's do line of the day.  We got a meeting to get...  Yeah, end of the day.  Yes, we're meeting with a...  Line of the day.  Very nice sponsor today.  Oh, pretty good.  Yes.  What do you mean a sponsor?  Meeting with a very nice sponsor in the conference room today. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought line of the day was sponsored.  No.  Ah.  Hey, a few things.  Jimmy's doing his book signing tomorrow in Chicago.  Tomorrow night, 7.30 at the Borders, 2817 North Clark Street in Chicago.  And as far as the ONA Travel and Virus Comedy Show goes, tomorrow's the big day.  The day everyone's been waiting for, Anthony.  $10 tickets.  What markets?  Yes.  Markets, Philly.  Philadelphia, New Jersey.  PNC, Jersey. 
[03:31:00]  Detroit.  Detroit.  Washington.  And I think that's it.  Detroit, Washington, and PNC.  And Philly.  And Philly.  Right.  I'm waiting for the book I just picked up to have a signing so I can go there and get  it signed, but I don't think it's going to happen.  What happened?  It's The Essential Hitler.  It's a great book.  I just picked up all of his speeches and commentary.  Commentary.  It is.  It's like commentary. 
[03:31:30]  No, it's a big book.  And I was reading it out back.  The book is giant.  I've got to put some kind of a cover on it because it's a giant book.  In big letters, it says Essential Hitler.  And there's just a picture of the Fuhrer on there with a huge swastika on it.  And there I am in my backyard laying down in a lounge chair with a glass of wine just reading  The Essential Hitler.  You want to make yourself a book cover out of photos of nude children.  Tell the neighbors it's up to them, whatever they want to look at. 
[03:32:00]  How are the neighbors?  We haven't had a neighbor update in a while.  They're fine.  They're fine.  They're all fine and dandy.  The house next door to me is almost done now because they were building another one next  door.  So who knows if I'll have new neighbors soon once the house is done.  That's got me a little nervous.  But given the neighborhood, I think it'll be just fine. 
[03:32:30]  I think a lovely Jewish family will move in next door to me.  I love my Jewish neighbors.  They're great.  What about the neighbor on the other side that came to your door with a cake or something?  They're wonderful.  I just, I'm an awful neighbor.  A neighbor.  How'd they come by, though?  No, last I saw, I walked over there because he had picked up a Shelby GT500.  The same car you have?  It upset me a little bit.  What the hell?  I know.  That's so obvious.  He saw you pull up and said, I need one of those.  I'm not used to the whole suburban thing where you got to keep up with the neighbors. 
[03:33:00]  It is, yeah.  So yeah, he came up with the gummi.  I don't think he'll be buying my library books.  But it was...  Same color and everything?  No, no, no, no.  It's got a convertible.  It's black.  But I'm sending mine off.  And if the people in Vegas can hear me over there at the Shelby Works, give me a goddamn  call.  I'm waiting.  I'm waiting to send my Shelby out to Vegas.  Oh, you haven't sent it yet.  Because I got it now one up, so I got to send it out to Vegas and get it done in Super Snake 
[03:33:30]  so it's got 720 horsepower.  New rear end, new exhaust, the whole thing.  How do you send it out there?  I ship it out there.  I get a car carrier and they carry the son of a bitch out there.  Then they bring it back when it's all vroom, vroom, ready to go.  And then, then, no one beats me.  Nice.  Nice.  I love it.  I'm going to miss you. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Remember I took that helicopter tour last year for my birthday?  Yes, and look at what happens.  Last week, one of those same helicopters went down in the Hudson River.  But everyone survived.  You do anything risky, Jimmy?  Your sexual practices used to be.  But now that you're in a relationship, they were risky.  You could have caught AIDS and died.  Do you know how many times I fucked out of bed?  I know.  Yeah, man.  You could have caught the AIDS.  It's almost like a death wish. 
[03:34:30]  Do you do risky behavior these days in any way where you go,  that was like a nice adrenaline boost?  No, I don't look at, I don't cruise whores.  Jimmy.  I don't do anything.  Jimmy.  Sometimes you put half and half in your coffee.  Nah, but I mean, that's like really nutty.  I'm feeling crazy like if it's like a weekend or something.  But no, I really don't, man.  I mean, no.  No.  Craigslist.  Oh, okay.  Let's do line of the day and get out.  Line of the day.  Do we have lines of the day yet there?  Line of the day.  You should. 
[03:35:00]  You do?  Two runners-ups or runner-ups?  Runners-ups.  I like runner-ups.  Hello?  I like runner-ups.  I like runners-ups.  Who's that?  Oh, who's on the phone, Jimmy?  Oh, hi.  Can I call you back?  Because I'm actually at work.  I'll be done in 10 minutes.  Yeah.  Who's the coach?  Who's the coach?  Disconnected.  I know.  I was being nice.  I could have yelled something out sooner.  Where's my mother?  No.  Yes.  Oh.  Is she going to read your book, by the way?  I'm halfway through Jimmy's book, maybe even more. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, maybe not.  How is Jimmy's mom ever going to read this book?  I wrote a nice thank you to them.  Is that what they're reading?  It's a thank you page?  That should be the only page in the book.  It's one page in the book.  Thank you.  Over and over again.  That's the version she gets.  With no cover on the book or anything.  All right.  Why don't we get a runner-up line of the day?  Yeah, the exit's over here, guys.  Hold on a second.  I'm leaving blindly in the blood.  Blair!  Blair!  The exit's over here. 
[03:36:00]  Oh.  Mass firing today?  That's great, man.  Did he say Blair?  Was it?  Did he say Blair?  Why?  We know a Blair?  No.  I was just thinking facts of life.  Oh, yeah.  I was just talking back.  Wow.  The exit's over here.  They're all just getting fired today.  Who knows with those clowns?  Another runner-up line of the day, E-Rock?  Oh, no.  What happened?  Uh-oh.  Oh, Thanos scolding.  He's pointing.  All right. 
[03:36:30]  Hit it.  You get home from the Red Sox game, and your wife's like, or girlfriend goes, I didn't  know I was a doubleheader today.  No, it wasn't a doubleheader.  It took an hour to get the game going.  Oh, no, no.  She's meant the size of his skull.  And you know what?  We'll get yelled at for making fun of him, yet we didn't put him in front of 60,000 people.  Exactly.  It's a thing.  What are we supposed to do?  Of course.  It was a waterheader.  There you go.  That's an assist.  There you go.  I think we're finally ready for Line of the Day. 
[03:37:00]  When Stephen Hawking walks up those steps, then I want to see them filmed.  Yes.  Then that would be impressive.  Roll him down the steps.  That's impressive.  Physicist madness.  Yes.  Yes. 
[03:37:30]  Yes.  And there's your Line of the Day.  Marble Madness Monday is in the books.  What a dumb bit.  All right.  What should we do?  We've got to start thinking of a bit.  Let's start thinking of a bit to do when Barry Bonds breaks the record.  756 something.  Let's do something.  756.  Let's do something that will get the news in.  Let's think in advance.  Super Bowls.  My ideas never worked, though.  I want to do a Super Bowl bit. 
[03:38:00]  How about this?  We go to Planned Parenthood.  We go through the dumpster.  Oh, my God.  I see a problem already.  Listen to me.  And we try to hit a home run?  No, no.  I love that.  Yes.  Or we throw 756 fetuses out the window with baseball hats on.  And we put little giant hats on them.  What the fuck, dude?  How is that awful?  Oh, well, that's not our goodbye music.  That's right.  You get a picture of the news.  Goodbye.  Bye.  In celebration, 756 little kersplats. 
[03:38:30]  Jimmy, are you going to be on Spike TV tonight?  Oh, yeah.  I guess the Spike Awards.  Spike Awards.  Yeah, and I also did that show.  I forgot about it.  This Beth O show with Steve Sharippa.  I did that like three weeks ago.  We taped that.  I think that's on today.  I don't know.  That and maybe it's the Spike Awards.  No, not the Spike Awards. 
[03:39:00]  You get to that.  That's what?  I guess it's that show.  Cinema.  What's it called?  I don't know.  I don't even know the name of it.  I'm dope.  All right.  Well, Jimmy might be on Spike TV tonight.  Yes.  Go check it out.  Hey, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  We'll see you tomorrow for $10 ticket Tuesday.  That's a real one.  $10 tickets all day tomorrow for the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  All the info is up on our MySpace page for that, which is VirusTour, one word.  Okay?  Have a great day.  Okay.
