<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie discussing his erratic sleep schedule and a movie marathon featuring *Capricorn One*, highlighting its dated special effects and O.J. Simpson's role.  This segued into a conversation about Jim Norton's low expectations for on-demand movies, specifically criticizing *Taken*. They then discussed illegally obtained movie screeners, with Opie recounting accidentally falling asleep during *Jurassic Park* and waking up to softcore porn.  The hosts contrasted their sleep aid preferences – Opie favoring distracting sounds, Jim preferring silence – touching on gun ownership and self-defense after Jim described nearly shooting at noises outside his apartment.  They then revisited a previous segment where they gave their intern, E-Rock, a peanut butter hat, deciding to give him another, considering a Fluffernutter hat or a Wonder Woman costume. Opie showed off new shoes and shared pictures of Sam's father's mustache and a Sirius employee's DeLorean tattoo, as well as a childhood picture of himself in a fur coat. The hosts joked about Facebook friend strategies and the impending E-Rock Wonder Woman costume reveal.  They briefly discussed President Obama's stance on Wall Street bonuses, followed by a "F.U. Line" segment and further discussion of Obama's policies, Jon Stewart's criticism of Sean Hannity, Pink Panther movies, and the stimulus package, including funding for honeybee insurance.  The segment concluded with more anticipation for E-Rock's costume.

The next segment opened with a discussion about the importance of bees and the negative impact of invasive species like the zebra mollusk and snakehead fish. A caller, Kyle from Texas, discussed Colony Collapse Disorder.  The hosts jokingly blamed cell phone towers for bee deaths.  The conversation shifted to Rod Blagojevich's impeachment, with the hosts mocking him.  The main focus then became the studio stunt involving E-Rock in a Wonder Woman costume and the creation of a "Fluff" hat (originally referred to as a Fluffernutter hat).  E-Rock's initial appearance in boxers under the costume led to a bathroom trip.  The Fluff hat creation was accompanied by much joking and ribbing of E-Rock, with pictures promised online.  The segment concluded with an extended, humorous interview with David, the "Executive Intern" and "Office Manager," where the hosts playfully interrogated him about his responsibilities, work ethic, and relationships with other staff members.

The following segment centered on the disastrous application of the "fluff" hat to E-Rock's head, causing pain and hair loss. David offered suggestions and critiques.  The conversation shifted to Joe Torre's new book and negative reactions from former Yankee players, touching on David Wells's alleged threat to assault Torre. The "fluff hat" bit continued, with E-Rock experiencing discomfort and even getting fluff in his eye.  The hosts suggested solutions, including taking him outside in the cold.  Listener call-ins were interspersed with ongoing commentary about E-Rock.  Discussions included Snuggies, the Super Bowl, the new president, and Iraq.  Future "hat" materials, including bubblegum, were jokingly suggested. The segment concluded with commentary on the "fluff hat" and listener participation.

A subsequent segment discussed a planned "ladies day" with only men accompanied by a female relative (excluding wives and girlfriends) permitted.  This transitioned to a discussion of snakehead fish, punctuated by vulgar jokes.  A caller, John, recounted his experience with a giant snakehead fish.  Bill Burr called in, initially discussing his past criticism of the ShamWow, then recounting a ShamWow demonstration that changed his mind.  Their conversation turned to Burr's rat problem and graphic descriptions of killing rodents. The show returned to the studio, with intern David reporting on an unengaging audience.  The hosts briefly discussed a staff member's physical attributes and made vulgar comments.  David introduced Anthony from Toronto and Karen, a nurse anesthetist, who shared a story of a dropped nipple during breast reduction surgery, leading to further jokes.


A call-in segment featured numerous callers, some sharing personal anecdotes, including a bizarre medical story involving a nipple and a discussion about a Verizon network engineer. Many callers were deemed uninteresting. Kevin, a limo dispatcher, and Sam, were from the same town, leading to jokes about free limo rides.  A contentious interaction with Vern from Philadelphia involved mutual insults about clothing and President Obama.  Dana, deemed the "most boring" caller, faced increasingly crude questions from the hosts, especially about her pool league experience.  The segment culminated in a tense exchange between David and the hosts regarding David's inappropriate questions and his defiance, leading to apologies to Dana and David’s continued refusal to read a final offensive question.  The language used was consistently vulgar and offensive.

The final segment involved an on-air argument with David, the executive intern, goading him into saying "I'm sorry, whore," resulting in his dismissal. The hosts sarcastically thanked unnamed guests using derogatory language, repeatedly chanting "Mar-mar," apparently a guest's surname. DirecTV was mentioned as a sponsor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  There's that music I look forward to hearing every ding-dong morning.  Yeah.  We gotta start with something, you know.  Yeah, apparently we do.  Hi.  Good morning, Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and you listening.  I got so lucky this week. It was one of those weeks where I had no clue what day it was because of my erratic sleep habits. 
[00:00:30]  So the entire day yesterday, up until I was texted on the expressway driving home yesterday, I was under the false assumption it was Wednesday.  And today would have been Thursday, and I had to wait a whole other day for Friday.  And then I was informed, hey, well, at least tomorrow is Friday. 
[00:01:00]  And then I looked and went, oh, it's Thursday. So I like skip the day.  You gotta be the happiest man alive.  When you skip a day of the weekend, it's so much better than when you think it's Wednesday and it's Tuesday.  That stinks.  Yeah.  And it happens that way, too.  When you realize it's not 2007.  Yeah, well, I'm still getting through that.  2007 was a nice year.  Was it?  It was all right.  I don't remember what happened in any years.  I really don't.  I'm just kind of like, man, whatever.  What is it now? 
[00:01:30]  2009.  Yeah.  Live the moment.  877-212-ON-A.  You slept until...  I was trying to...  Dude, this week has been some of the wackiest sleeping I've done since we had two years off.  But it's good.  You might be in a new cycle.  I don't know.  You look well-rested and...  Well, I am for the show.  But personal life.  But then, like, after the show, I try to stay up, but I'm just done by that point. 
[00:02:00]  And then I wind up sleeping until well after 6 p.m.  It's gotten later and later.  7, 8.  And then yesterday, I woke up at 5, which would have been a good nap.  Home by noon.  Yeah.  Sleeping by noon.  Up at 5.  Up at 5 in the afternoon.  That's supposed to be a little nap.  I've slept a lot.  Morning guys do, like, a noon to one nap.  Yeah.  So that would have been, like, all right, now from 5 on until probably, you know, 11 maybe.  Easy, right?  I could do whatever I want. 
[00:02:30]  Go shoot guns.  Right.  See how the construction's going in your house.  Whatever I wanted to do.  Maybe try to find a little Betty for yourself.  You know what I...  Betty.  You know what I did?  Sorry.  A Betty.  That's what we called them in Buffalo.  Buffalo.  The Buffalo Bettys.  It wasn't flattering, by the way.  No.  The women out there.  Heifers.  They were the big ones.  The big Buffalo Bettys, but they were easy pickings. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  They tend to be everywhere you go.  A bit on the tender side, but you know what?  What the hell?  It's still good eats.  Good eating.  Yeah.  Anyway, sorry.  So I decided that when I woke up on the couch at five, I decided it was time to just go  to bed.  So I got up at five in the afternoon and went to bed.  Nice.  Where I turned the TV on, put on a movie, and just fell asleep.  And then I woke up at about 11, 15. 
[00:03:30]  What movie?  I believe I put on...  What do you do?  Like just throw HBO on or something and just go with it?  Oh, no.  I tried going with a movie for a while.  One I haven't seen since I think it was on when Cable first came out.  It stars James Brolin, O.J. Simpson, and a guy that's on one of those Law & Order shows  or was on one of those shows. 
[00:04:00]  I can't remember his name.  Towering Inferno?  No, no, no.  Capricorn One.  Oh, okay.  Where they fake the Mars landing.  Is that Farrah Fawcett and Kirk Douglas?  No.  Oh, that was...  Capricorn One.  Does it hold up?  No.  What's the biggest problem?  The special effects again?  Yeah, and just O.J. being in it.  I can't watch anything with O.J. in it and go, ha, murderer.  It's this murderer guy. 
[00:04:30]  But is he a good actor?  Actor.  Dude, he doesn't have a line for the first hour of the movie.  He's just walking around with the other two astronaut guys.  But he's one of the main astronauts, right?  Yeah, but he doesn't talk.  But he's black.  He doesn't have a line.  Well, yeah.  That was, like, groundbreaking back then.  O.J.  It's like, why?  As the black astronaut.  Yeah, black astronaut.  But it was O.J.  The whole country loved him.  Yeah.  But, oh, the story is fantastic.  You know, they have this Mars... 
[00:05:00]  A Mars spaceship supposed to take off on Mars.  And then for the last minute, they pull the astronauts out without telling anybody.  Launch the ship.  Use fake tapes.  And the head of the program, who is...  What's his name from Creepshow?  So, just tell him to call you Billy.  Leslie Nielsen.  No, Hal Holbrook.  He was, like, the head of the program.  And he has to tell him, look, we found out you guys wouldn't have lived.  We paid, you know, the lowest bidder and this life support system wasn't going to work. 
[00:05:30]  So, we would have lost the whole program.  It's teetering on the brink anyway.  They wanted to eliminate it.  So, we're pulling you guys out.  You guys just got to go on this set and act like you're doing this or we're going to kill your families.  Well, great.  So, they kind of do it and go through the motions.  And then some of them start having second thoughts and everything like that.  And then there's a malfunction.  How could you have second thoughts if they're going to say you're going to kill your family?  It was like this thing where over months, because it took months, they just started getting these second thoughts.  But they went with it.  Up until re-entry, the heat shield separates from the capsule and they would have been dead. 
[00:06:00]  So, now they got to be dead.  Ah.  Now, they kind of escape and now they're running out in the desert being hunted by NASA people.  Yeah.  You know, because they have to be killed off.  I won't give up the thrilling conclusion, though.  I fell asleep anyway.  What?  And I kind of forgot how it ended.  Well, I'll watch it.  You know.  Look.  I don't care.  It's safe to say O.J. lives. 
[00:06:30]  They're not going to kill O.J. back in the late 70s.  O.J. was the first to die.  Oh, they killed him.  Yeah.  They made a little pact before they split up.  They went in separate directions.  Yeah.  And they made a little pact before they left that if you get caught or you, you know, are ready to get killed or can't make it any further, set off a flare.  And, you know, they showed the helicopter's coming up to O.J.  And O.J. is like all, you know, he's all beaten and dehydrated.  And he sets off his flare.  And the other two guys kind of see in the distance like a pshhh. 
[00:07:00]  And, oh, well, one of them's gone.  That's the black guy rule.  The black guy was always going.  Yeah, he's got to go first.  78.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a weirdo.  I know.  Why are you?  Why am I watching this?  Because of, I mean.  It's nostalgia.  And take that as, I guess, a weird compliment, but out of all the movies you could watch yesterday, Capricorn 1.  I've watched every movie.  You're just running out of movies?  You're the guy that is running out of movies.  On cable, I've watched them all. 
[00:07:30]  And then, like I said, on the Netflix.  Dude, I gave you, not I, I didn't give it to you, but, or somebody gave it to you.  The Slumdog Millionaire.  I have Slumdog.  You've got a really good movie just sitting at your house and you're watching Capricorn 1.  The thing is, I want to be conscious for that movie.  I was really, it was one of those movies I could put on and go, I'm dozing, I don't care.  Yeah, okay.  And I fell asleep.  I would have fallen asleep at the end of Slumdog, which would have pissed me off.  Maybe you're not a weirdo, though.  Maybe that's kind of cool.  Like, well, why can't I just sit down and watch Capricorn 1 and go, ah, this movie is 30 years old. 
[00:08:00]  I'm going to check it out.  Yeah, and I remember seeing it.  It's like popping on Westworld.  One of those kind of movies, you know.  Again, I think James Brolin's in that one, too.  Because I go to movies on demand and I am, I'm probably like the regular Joe out there.  I'm so picky.  Yeah.  I'll go through every movie and go, no, no, no, no.  And then I get to the end, to the Z movies that are always just weird titles.  And then I go, why do I even have this service?  I never watch any of these movies.  By the way, every so often you've got to go from Z till A. 
[00:08:30]  Because a lot of times you'll find something you want to watch in the upper channels  and never even know what's in the, or in the upper part of the alphabet.  And never know what's down there in the, or, you know.  That's my problem.  I make it to Z every time without finding a movie I want to watch.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  You're in trouble.  I'm just stupid.  You've got to lower your expectations in sight.  That's what I'm getting at.  That's what I do.  I've lowered them way down.  Hence, maybe I shouldn't be calling you a weirdo.  Capricorn 1.  Give it a view.  You should give me just a list of movies that I should just watch. 
[00:09:00]  For no real reason.  They're killing our movie in the paper today.  Oh, Taken.  Wow.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Jimmy might be right on this, but they're killing Taken.  I've changed my...  The Liam Neeson movie.  I've started to...  First, I lost confidence in my opinion.  Yeah.  And then that was enough to chip away where now I'm completely like, I think the movie  sucked.  Dude, the daughter...  Now, this is a visual, but this is my impression of the daughter running.  Yes, please. 
[00:09:30]  Dad!  Well, they had to make it very clear that she was innocent and youthful and not ready  to go to Europe on her own.  Any retard running.  That was her.  She's as dumb as they come.  And her friend was a 30-year-old playing a 17-year-old.  That took me out of the movie a little bit.  Troublesome whore friend.  Her friend N.B. Davis.  Right.  I liked it for what it was...  For what it is.  A free movie. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Maybe I wouldn't have liked it as much if I had to pay.  What are the citizens paying for a movie these days?  I don't know.  A lot of money.  I enjoy a good movie that's on a DVD and the name of it is in Sharpie.  That's the movies I enjoy.  With a big, do not copy this, federal law, states.  Whenever you so often, you know, screen or copy for your consideration comes up on the  bottom.  But these mother effers are getting smart.  How many movies have you taken home popped in and they say, I forget exactly how they 
[00:10:30]  say this, but they're basically saying, courtesy of Opie and Anthony or for Opie and Anthony.  They put our names right on the screen and you feel like, wow, I think we were part of  the filming of this movie because it's kind of a credit that just keeps popping up for  Opie and Anthony or something like that.  They can't copy it or else they'll know where it came from.  Right.  You're like, that's pretty much it.  Like, I have a side job.  I'm copying these screeners and running down to Chinatown and laying them up, laying them  out on a sidewalk for everybody. 
[00:11:00]  I mean, I don't have time to do that.  Oh.  Yeah, I got the, I, I, sorry, I missed that.  And then, um, then I wake up and I guess Jurassic Park is on.  And this was one of those situations where a movie that's kind of a family type, you  know, blockbuster regular movie turns into porno, softcore porno, because I had that on.  But then when I wake up for work, when the alarm goes on and then stupid cable vision,  I really got to, I hate that they wind down. 
[00:11:30]  There's no option to stop the, your, uh, uh, DVR from winding down and going into sleep  mode.  And you'll hear the sound, but it'll say, press any button to, you know, start up your  DVR again.  And, uh, I like just having the TV on, but I can't have it on when you have cable vision  because they just, it just stops.  It just stops in the middle of the night.  So goddamn annoying.  So, uh, Jurassic Park was on and I fall back asleep.  I wake up for work and I'm hearing, uh, uh, uh, uh, and I can't find the remote fast 
[00:12:00]  enough till I get the picture.  It's like covered up in my blankets and I'm like, God damn.  And I hit it and it's one of those softcore, you know, Emanuela kind of porno movies are  on and Jurassic Park was just on.  Some of those soft porns are.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Very good.  And all I heard before I got the remote, all I heard was, well, what are you doing here?  Oh, really?  One of those?  You're naked.  You're naked. 
[00:12:30]  I was like, wow, there's a remote.  I can lend you some of my rain CDs if you need noise to fall asleep to.  Oh, no, no, no.  I need that.  Would that freak you out?  I need mindless stuff.  That's like.  When you're falling asleep though, you're like, oh wow, I'm back at my grandma's house and  I'm like 16 and I'm falling asleep and there's a rainstorm in the distance.  And you forget you're in a big building in the middle of Manhattan.  It gets me thinking.  I'm like, oh, economy.  That would scare you, you think?  Economy's bad.  Thunderstorm CDs would scare you? 
[00:13:00]  No, it just gives me too much.  It's not enough of distraction.  How about a beach with just waves and a couple seagulls?  Not enough distraction.  I got one of those too.  And then maybe like an ocean liner goes by way in the distance.  No.  Not enough distraction.  And then back to the wave.  Too much time.  Rainforest?  I got one of those.  No.  The rain gets intense though.  Unless there's like wild animals.  You feel like you're under a canopy sleeping on a nice summer night.  No?  Sounds nice, but.  How about a little brook?  No.  With little owls in the background. 
[00:13:30]  Woo.  No.  I got them all.  Try them out.  I need diehard gladiator, alien, aliens, Shawshank.  I just need.  Dude, how do you.  For real, I do throw these CDs in.  Every once in a while.  And if the thunderstorm, you know, is too loud, it wakes me up.  I'm like, what the F?  Dude, I slept through the T-Rex.  That's what I'm getting at.  You're a good sleeper.  Doing that yell in surround sound in my room. 
[00:14:00]  You're a great sleeper.  Makes for great dreams.  I got to tell you that though.  Sometimes they creep in there and it's kind of fun.  But no, I need massive distractions when I'm going to sleep.  Wow.  I don't like just silence.  I can never sleep like that.  I need a little white noise.  I could never go.  I got a white noise machine now from Brookstone.  I like white noise from like the 20s.  Some marching music.  Maybe I can find you some marching music. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, I got like a sound machine from Brookstone.  Yeah.  I got to trash them.  Awful acoustics.  I need a nice like sound machine to fall asleep.  They have white noise.  They have rain and water and ocean.  Don't they have that on like your cable service?  Nah.  Like in your music channels?  Well, they got the spacey new age stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I got like, they wound up, you know, I sprung for the sound system in the bedroom and stuff.  So a lot of times I swear I'm going to just shoot through my balcony door in the bedroom because it sounds sometimes like something's coming in through my door because it surrounds down. 
[00:15:00]  I'm laying in bed.  And I swear it makes it sound like something is in the room.  I can relate to that.  At least in your scenario, it's possible because you only have like two floors.  Yeah.  Imagine the same scenario, but you live on the 40th floor and you are checking outside the window.  It could be Batman.  Right. 
[00:15:30]  I've done it.  I'm like, where's that come from?  It's coming from outside.  I got to take a look.  And then I'm like, you're insane.  You're 500 feet off the ground.  There's nothing out there.  It's impossible.  I don't have outdoors.  It's impossible.  I don't have outdoor space.  I just have windows.  Yeah.  What are they going to do?  Right.  Suction cup their way up?  But at least with you, you know, they could possibly, you know.  It's been known to happen.  Right.  Right.  You know, people have gotten in second floor windows.  Of course, mine are locked in alarms and the second, if anybody really was there, they'd  have a laser dot on their head. 
[00:16:00]  But yeah.  God, I can't even tell you how many times I almost just stopped over to say hi.  Everyone's safe.  You know something?  Everyone is safe if they're just stopping by.  I never, I would never do it.  I hear some people that have shot through doors.  That's stupid, right?  Like, it's crazy.  One guy, I get the NRA publication every month, you know, and they have the armed citizen portion  at the beginning where it gives you about five or six stories of how armed citizens thwarted 
[00:16:30]  crime, whether against themselves or somebody else, usually against themselves.  And one this month was, guy, I hear some sounds.  He looks out a window and sees three guys, masks on.  One of them is armed, and they're trying to bash in his front door.  So he grabs his shotgun, and the second the door opened, I think he had a chain lock on  it or something.  It opened enough for him to, he shoved the barrel out and pulled the trigger. 
[00:17:00]  That's it.  And he's fine.  Wow.  Because, you know, they were armed.  I guess it's enough.  But even in that situation, I think I would stand back and take some cover and wait for  that door to open and 100% know what your target is.  I understand, you know, he's probably very scared.  He knew that they were armed.  They were wearing masks.  It's not like you're going to probably hit someone innocent if you just shoved the barrel 
[00:17:30]  out the door, but, you know, to not identify that target like that is, it's a little iffy  with me.  I'd probably fall back, you take some cover, wait for that door to open, and then just  blast the hell out of him.  I know the difference between you and I.  I would, I would shoot everybody.  You would just start blasting through the door.  I'm not even joking.  That's why I don't even attempt to get a gun.  I know I would be the guy that would shoot myself in the leg or something stupid.  The guys would come in and go, oh my God, look at this moron. 
[00:18:00]  Like the self-control you have to have to have a gun is this.  It's called responsibility.  Dude, I can't even like get ready in the morning without giving myself a bunch of bruises and  dropping things on my feet and all sorts of crap.  It's second nature to me.  I can't even imagine having a gun in that scenario that I've got to work around.  Part of my ritual to just like, you know, pop the clip when I'm leaving in the morning.  You know, chick, chick.  Eh, there we go.  Are you still wearing it around the house?  No, I don't wear it around the house.  I do, you know. 
[00:18:30]  Sometimes, though, I will just take one downstairs and kind of like leave it, leave it next to  me on the couch.  Just in case you have an itch on your head?  Well, you know what it is.  If somebody decides to just ram and kick through my door, I really don't have time to run to  where the guns are.  You do know that.  No one's going to do that, right?  Do I?  Yeah.  Do I, Opie?  Yeah.  Do I?  Yeah.  Well, you tell that to somebody who it's happened to.  You tell that little story that it's not going to happen to somebody that probably did have 
[00:19:00]  it happen.  You pretty much have a cop that lives with you at this point.  What?  Let him deal with it.  No.  When I'm alone or just sitting there with a friend or something like that?  Yeah.  What the hell?  All right.  You know, the gun's got to be within reach or else it's useless.  Who am I to say?  Yeah, I guess if you're going to have it, you should.  I have it.  You can't.  You know my layout.  If someone kicks that door open, I ain't getting to the guns.  Do you lay guns around like people lay phones around the house so they're close to a phone 
[00:19:30]  at all times?  You hear a break-in.  It's like when a phone rings and you go, I got one right here in the living room.  That's right.  One's in the den.  One's in the kitchen.  Yeah.  If you hear a break-in, you're like, I'll use the .38 in the kitchen.  When the phone rings, who needs to go search for it, right?  No.  See?  Now you know how to think.  I got it.  I'm just trying to understand a little bit.  We've got to take a break.  Wow, Friday.  No one else thinking, last Friday, we gave E-Rock the peanut butter hat.  Yes, a video. 
[00:20:00]  I think we need to give him another hat today.  A hat.  I haven't thought past the fact that we need to give him another hat today.  But maybe if someone comes up with a good idea, we could give E-Rock another hat.  It's all frozen on the sidewalk at this point, and people pick it up.  It's the law.  I would love to.  Wouldn't that be great?  And then the dog feces hat.  Oh, wow.  Then the game could be, guess where the crap ends and the head begins.  If we come up with a good hat idea, we'll give E-Rock another hat. 
[00:20:30]  A hat.  Yeah, we did peanut butter last week, which, how high was that damn thing?  It reached all the way up to the heavens.  Praise his name.  Oh, no.  Praise his name.  Praise his name.  Praise his name.  Oh, Christian Jimmy.  Did you guys try to put a bill on that hat?  Hmm?  Like, did you guys try to mold a...  No, no.  Okay, because it looked like in the video at one point you were actually trying to mold  what was a baseball cap type bill.  Look at it.  I mean, you know, maybe if you were here, you could have helped a little bit. 
[00:21:00]  Well, I wasn't.  No, I'm just saying.  Oh, yeah.  Put a little cardboard.  We were just...  Oh, that would have been a good idea.  For like a little scaffolding, you know?  Well, then we tried to give him like a mask, like a Lone Ranger mask.  Oh.  And that didn't work out too well.  So maybe we could give him another hat today.  An ant's here so we could really do a good one.  All right.  Let's find a good product.  The peanut butter was easily eight inches off his head.  Easily, if not higher.  And we got lots of great stuff to do.  It's going to be a good Friday show here.  And, Jimmy, you got tickets going on sale today. 
[00:21:30]  Nine this morning.  My show with Artie Lang at the Tower Theater, February 21st.  Tickets on sale at 9 this morning at LiveNation.com.  All right.  We'll continue.  Opie and Anthony.  I like the shock in your face, Ed.  Thanks.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning to everybody.  I was just showing off my new shoes because they're kind of famous, too.  Because I just wandered around New York yesterday.  I bought shoes.  And I'm like, well, might as well take a picture and send it to the followers on Twitter. 
[00:22:00]  So now they're like famous shoes, too.  So if you have a picture up on the Internet and then you've got that item on you, it's  now famous.  So these shoes are kind of famous.  Yeah.  I see you looking at those shoes.  Do you recognize those?  I saw them on Twitter last night.  Wow.  Those are the ones.  Now you're seeing them live.  Yeah.  How do you feel?  That's got to be.  They were in the box.  I saw them on Twitter last night.  I mean, I actually bought and took the picture as they're still in the box.  And then I had to deal with the comments that, what, you go to pay less and this and that. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, well, of course.  Let me know that I splurged and I spent almost $100 on my new shoes.  Perhaps more than that.  And I went with the Merrells, because people are wondering.  What are they?  Merrells.  Never heard of them.  Merrell?  Pretty big brand.  I just know 5'11".  Oh.  The other thing?  Tactical.  Unless it has tactical behind it, I don't wear it.  Yeah, I understand.  I got to take more pictures of you, because your pictures, they get viewed a lot by my followers. 
[00:23:00]  A lot.  Oh, my God.  Look at that one.  That was my embarrassment picture.  Yeah.  When we were playing old audio from the old days, I snapped a picture of Anthony just kind  of trying to disappear.  Yeah.  You almost disappeared.  I did.  Last night, I also put a picture up.  And if you could find it, Dan, that would be great.  Sam's father's mustache is officially on my Twitter account.  No.  Yeah, you got to see this thing.  Wow, that's worth the price of popping in right there. 
[00:23:30]  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Tell your dad to blow his nose, by the way.  That's the comments I'm getting.  That he's got a bunch of boogers up his nose.  Yeah.  No boogers in his nose.  Oh, what the hell is going on there?  It's Sam's father.  Sam's father, for the people that don't know, Sam's father has an amazing handlebar mustache  that he's had for, what, 30, 40 years?  Yeah.  He refuses to cut that thing.  And I suggest the next time he takes a nap, you snip the sides on him.  Oh, wow.  Just snip the sides a little bit. 
[00:24:00]  He'd be angry.  He'd be really upset.  You could tell he uses a little wax.  That's a horrendous look.  Yeah, I'm sure your father's a great guy.  He is.  He's a fantastic man.  But that's a horrendous mustache.  No one does that.  It's 2009.  I go, let me take a picture of just your mustache.  And he was like, okay.  And he started getting his mustache ready and curling up the ends.  No one, yeah, it's 2009.  But then I saw the 18th.  He should be on one of those bicycles with the big front wheel and the little tiny back 
[00:24:30]  wheel.  Oh, shaker.  Yeah.  But now that I've seen my dad's mustache on Opie's Twitter, I can't wait to see him  again because it's famous now.  See?  See what happens?  You're right, though, right?  Yeah.  Look at the famous shoes.  Oh, my God.  Those are the ones from last night.  They're right here, Sam.  And then I also got a picture for you last night, Ant.  One of the dudes at Sirius is a big Back to the Future fan.  I can't believe I'm even mentioning Back to the Future.  Wow.  That can mean 20 minutes of, oh, my God, please make it stop radio.  But with that said, he's got a DeLorean logo across the back of his neck. 
[00:25:00]  Why would someone do that?  He also said he used to own a DeLorean.  He just really likes the movie.  And he's a young kid.  He's not even that old, right?  Yeah.  I don't even think he's 30.  Wow.  He's in his late 20s.  Look.  And that one's for you.  There you go, Ant.  I put that up just for you.  Oh, Jesus.  The DeLorean logo.  Do it to yourself.  That's almost worth growing a mullet to cover that up.  Oh, wow.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[00:25:30]  But as far as bad tattoos go, that's in the bad tattoo category.  It's supposed to have that chrome look to it.  Right.  And it's not coming off as chrome.  Well, you can't put it on the back of your neck either, man.  You've got to, like, hide that crap and show it.  Here, look, look, check it out.  And lift up your sleeve.  And it's not very symmetrical, the D and the C.  No.  It's like a prison tat.  Yeah.  So.  Prisoners that love Back to the Future series.  Yeah.  So, and what I'm sending today, Anthony, it leads to today's picture. 
[00:26:00]  Yes.  And, boy, this is going to get some views today, my friend.  Yeah.  Anthony just gave me a picture of him wearing the fur coat.  Yes.  I've done a lot of talking and bitching about the fur coat that mommy bought me because when I was about seven years old, she bought me a fur coat because she said, hey, Joe Namath wears it.  Right.  Joe Namath wears a fur coat.  Oh, wow.  It's in style.  It's the fashion.  Right.  So you wear it.  So I wore a fur coat to school and promptly got hit. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Because, you know, you're a queer if you go to school and you wear a fur coat.  So, yeah, there I am in my little fur coat.  It's pretty much the only picture ever of me in the fur coat.  Yeah.  I'm behind my sister Dawn.  You have the blue fur coat on.  It's like a grayish, what would you call that, charcoal?  No.  I don't know what you'd call it.  But it's, yeah, it's, I'm in the background kind of behind Dawn next to my mother and my brother's way off to the right of the photo. 
[00:27:00]  And, yeah, that's me, little me in my fur coat.  You look like Joe Namath.  Just like him.  That was the thing.  Like when my mother decided I should wear a fur coat.  Wonderful.  And send.  Send to the followers.  There it is.  Opi Radio on Twitter.  Having fun with the Twitter.  I am pimping in that.  You're right.  You are pimping.  I said that.  Dawn looks like a guy in that picture. 
[00:27:30]  Like a, you know.  Dawn looks like a little boy.  You all look like little girls.  Joe looks like Nancy McKeon, who was Joe from the Facts of Life.  Yeah.  That's who he looks like.  Or a very young Robbie Benson.  Yeah.  It also has a Robbie Benson look to him.  I just look like some little fruit.  And, yeah, Dawn looks like a little boy.  Nah, you guys look like some hip European family.  Oh, really?  Yeah, like you guys live on a yacht and you're just visiting America.  Visiting your American relatives or something.  There's nothing American about that picture. 
[00:28:00]  And we don't know anything about fashion in this country.  Nah, it's like cool where you're from type of thing, you know.  That picture taken.  Also, a little trivia for the picture.  Yeah.  In my grandmother's house where we still go to this day for Christmas, for a Christmas  Eve dinner and Thanksgiving dinner.  Nice.  No, the velvet raised little things on the wallpaper.  See, if you look in the back, you see that little thing?  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  That was raised green velvet on the wallpaper, by the way. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, not too WAP to have in your house.  Yeah, that's gone.  That's long gone.  And this picture is also on your Facebook, so.  Yeah.  Which you can't even keep up with anymore.  I've been trying, but I think.  It gets crazy.  I think I'm teetering right about five grand as far as friends go, so once I hit five  thousand.  Why doesn't Facebook make it more than five grand?  I think they're trying to keep it, you know, where it was your real friends.  Well, no one has five thousand friends, though.  Not just teet with, you know, other sites that. 
[00:29:00]  But see, the cool thing with MySpace, it's all about the numbers, so you're sitting there  like, wow, look at me.  It's all fake friends and stuff, but it's cool to watch the numbers go up.  I topped out.  You don't want to top out with these networking sites.  It could be like Call of Duty, though.  Once you top out, just cash it all in.  You should start over.  And, yeah, what do they call that?  When you do that in Call of Duty, you get to the top rank, and then you just cash it  all back in again.  And start from scratch.  Know what you should do?  I might do that.  Prestige, yes.  To go through the prestige phase of my. 
[00:29:30]  You know what your goal should be?  I have 4,342 friends.  But, hey, this is your goal.  You're going to get 5,000.  I'll hit five today.  Well, yeah, you could have it already if you, like, kept up with it.  I only have, like.  Then start knocking out the dudes and be the first person on Facebook that has 5,000  chicks.  All the.  That would be cool.  All the guys are starting to get one.  When I actually make them one of my friends, they're starting to go, oh, I can't believe  I got in before you start kicking guys out to just get girls.  Because that's what's going to happen next. 
[00:30:00]  That is kind of a cool goal.  I'm going to go through and just, like, knock off a few guys.  Yeah.  And then wait for just girls to come in.  And then I'll just pop them on, knock out a few more, and try to get 5,000 girls.  Exclusively just girls.  And then when you get 5,000 girls, then you drop it to 5,000 girls under 30.  No, no.  Start with under 30.  Just go with anybody.  Just hot?  Just.  And then hot.  And just hot.  And then start dropping out down the ages where you're just hot teen girls, 5,000 of them. 
[00:30:30]  Is there any way to find out how many guys you got on Facebook and how many girls?  Oh, it's ridiculous.  It's got to be all guys, because that's our number one demo, unfortunately.  I'd probably have 5% girls to 95% guys as far as friends go.  I mean, you know, the guys keep us working, but come on.  Keep us in $100 sneakers.  That's nothing, though.  Everyone's paying almost $100 for shoes these days.  Of course.  Of course.  All right.  E-Rock.  Last week, we did a peanut butter hat. 
[00:31:00]  I thought we were playing a game.  I was going to go fat, stupid.  What are we doing like?  Lazy.  Late to work.  The password is Bluewell.  God, and he does everything for us as far as these.  Does he?  He's never said no to any of the things we ask of him.  Well, last week, Anthony, Jimmy and I gave him a peanut butter hat because of the salmonella.  Salmonella.  Salmonella.  So that was our little excuse to make E-Rock wear a peanut butter hat, which was quite 
[00:31:30]  large, about eight inches off his head, and then he went outside, and people were just  mad at him.  Why wouldn't you be?  And then the dude downstairs goes, I get it.  Slumdog Millionaire, right?  Yeah.  And I didn't even see Slumdog Millionaire at that point, and then I did see the movie.  I'm like, wow, it's the exact same color as when the kid fell into the what?  The outhouse.  Anyway, we've decided that we need to give E-Rock another hat today.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  But we're starting to think Fluffernutter. 
[00:32:00]  So where's the E-Rock?  Is he around?  Someone on, uh...  Or we could give him a...  I'll talk has a good one.  A Nair hat.  No, Stunt Brain did that one already.  Oh!  Oh, no.  That hat.  Oh, boy.  Why?  Uh, E-Rock.  Actually, Sam, the real reason why Sam is in here, because he brought it to my attention,  we went off on a little tangent there, Ant, but Sam might have a, uh, uh, what?  A choice that E-Rock can make right here. 
[00:32:30]  Well, maybe.  I mean, it's up to the rest of you guys.  Our new intern, Paul, has brought in an item that he has had with him because he says he  wants E-Rock to put it on.  Okay.  It is an adult-size Wonder Woman costume.  It's a onesie, so the legs are exposed.  Oh, God.  Uh...  Oh, no.  Does it have the wig?  I don't know if it...  No, it does not have the wig, but it's perfect, by the way.  It has the little Wonder Woman head tiara. 
[00:33:00]  But, yes, it does have the tiara, he's telling me.  Okay.  And, uh, he thinks, does intern Paul, that E-Rock would look very nice in it.  Okay.  Well, the cunning linguist is saying E-Rock has the boobs for it, so...  So, let her rip.  E-Rock, would you wear the Wonder Woman outfit today?  As we give you a fluffernutter hat?  He said there was a choice.  Yeah, the choice is do it or you're fired.  Oh, look at that.  That choice.  That choice stinks.  What kind of choice do you think we're going to give you? 
[00:33:30]  We're doing both today.  You just got Sophie's choice.  Do it or you're fired.  Oh, my God.  Look at him.  Why the woman got to do that?  No!  Oh!  Look at it.  Oh, is that embarrassing.  I'm more creeped out that the intern has one of these.  Those are the boots.  Oh, you got the boots and everything, E-Rock.  Will he fit in this thing?  I don't know.  Sierra?  Yes, he will.  Oh, he has to.  Sam, would he fit?  It stretches, E-Rock.  Perfect.  I'm not worried about the width.  I'm worried about the length.  Ah!  It stretches that way, too. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Come on, E-Rock.  Yeah.  It's all about the one.  What?  Hey, by the way.  You wore it already?  What do you have that for?  You could step up to a mic.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah.  I wore it to a friend's superhero party.  Oh.  Superhero party?  Superhero party.  I think any guy that does that for Halloween or a party and dresses like a girl has some  kind of an issue.  I just do.  I think if a guy does, any guy, any guy that dresses like a woman for Halloween has some  kind of issue.  I don't know.  How about if said guy does it, I don't know, in January, perhaps? 
[00:34:30]  All right.  That's even more of an issue.  That's just kind of funny.  Yeah.  Look, girls.  It's hysterical.  Sometimes I want to feel pretty, too, Ant.  All right.  Yeah, there's nothing wrong about it.  You've got the nice long locks for it.  So sure.  And the big, burly beard.  Yeah.  Guy looks like a trucker.  Looks like a big John Studd if you're a tranny.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  E-Rock, what do you say?  It's a visual.  We want you in the Wonder Woman costume and then possibly a Fluffernutter hat today. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  E-Rock, if it makes your decision easier, there is built-in wiring for support.  Oh, good.  An underwire?  You might need that.  All right, E-Rock.  Get to it.  Yeah, baby.  No, guys that go to Renaissance Fairs, all man.  Huh?  I'm commenting on people that say, what about guys who go to Renaissance Fairs?  And I haven't been to one since, you know.  Since now you don't like them anymore, right?  Break up.  Well.  You used to love them, but now you don't, right?  I used to go.  I enjoyed the beer, you know, the big turkey leg. 
[00:35:30]  You don't like them anymore?  I probably won't go unless, you know, find someone fun to go with.  Uh-huh.  You'll find someone fun to go with.  Will I?  Yes.  I hope so.  I got a sword and everything.  When is the Renaissance Fairs?  It's at the end of the summer.  Cool.  Up in Tuxedo, New York.  You know what my brothers...  I lost interest already.  All right.  My brothers went this past season.  They freaking thought it was the coolest thing ever.  Yeah.  I went a long time ago in Rochester.  I threw the axes. 
[00:36:00]  See?  That's what it is.  You got to get hammered and throw the axes and the stars.  Like darts over your head.  I loved it.  What's wrong, Iraq?  He's got a problem already.  What could be...  What?  It's bad enough.  I got to do this, right?  And I'm willing to do it.  But to go back into the office and have Steve going, why don't you ever say no to this?  What's wrong with Steve?  What?  Bring Steve in.  All right.  Steve, you're putting on the costume.  Oh, he wouldn't fit in there.  Why would you encourage our people to say no to stuff? 
[00:36:30]  I didn't encourage him.  I just said, why don't you ever say no?  Just out of blatant curiosity.  I understand that, Eric.  It was a question.  You don't have to get all emotional about it.  It was a question.  Because did you ever know that Opie's his hero?  I know.  Believe me.  Trust me.  I've thought of that many times.  Opie could tell Iraq anything.  I know.  Believe me.  Because it's documented that he's a hero.  You still got it up there?  No, that's long gone.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Showed me. 
[00:37:00]  Sure did.  You were crying like me until I was 20.  All right, Iraq.  Go put on your Wonder Woman costume.  And then we're going to give you a fluffernutter hat.  Also, we're coming in.  Does this make him Hoagie Girl?  Oh, this is the Hoagie Girl costume.  Hoagie Girl.  Actually, yeah.  Why don't we make some adjustments to the costume and turn it into Hoagie Girl?  Blunder Woman.  That adult.  There he goes. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, go into the bathroom to change it so you've got some pride and privacy and dignity.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  We're going to get into some material.  It's Friday.  We're kind of screwing off a little bit, but there's a lot of things happening in the news.  Can I say I'm liking Obama a lot today?  He annoyed me yesterday.  You hated him yesterday.  I hated him.  He really annoyed me.  Yes, on his foreign policy.  Loving him today.  Hold that point and we'll find out why Jimmy's loving Obama.  I think that's the type of thing that's going to happen.  Did he resign?  No.  Okay.  You're going to like him one day.  You're going to not like him the next. 
[00:38:00]  I mean, he's very controversial.  Still waiting for that day to come about for me.  Oh, no.  You're a lost cause.  I do want to ask you one question about Obama, though, sometime this morning.  It's very easy.  Maybe you can think about it during the break.  What is it going to take for you to like Obama?  All right.  Very open-ended question.  I understand that.  Okay.  What is it going to take?  Take the good half and double it.  What if he told you you never have to pay taxes again?  Would that be enough for you to like Obama? 
[00:38:30]  Don't answer now.  Answer after the break.  I'm back.  Because we're running late.  All right.  But I do want to know that today.  F.U.  Line.  We're going to do that for everybody because it is Friday.  Do they need time or can we just play it?  I can come right now.  No.  I'm playing it.  All right.  We'll be back in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Here is the F.U.  Line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U.  Line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.  You have nine new voice messages. 
[00:39:00]  First voice message.  Yeah.  I'd like to give a big fuck you to Al Gore.  Oh, look out for general warming.  It's coming.  It's coming.  Well, how come it's 12 degrees every morning when I fucking wake up instead of the normal  30 degrees it is every other fucking winter?  I hate you.  Go fuck yourself.  Next message.  I want to give a big giant fuck you to the stupid, stupid lady that bought my couch from  my yard sale yesterday for seven fucking dollars and I delivered it to a damn house and she  didn't even fucking pay me to seven dollars.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah.  I wanted to say fuck you to the D.O.T. 
[00:39:30]  You guys are nothing but fuck stains on the sheet of humanity.  Next message.  I just want to give a big fat fuck you to my former boss.  All the while you were telling me how you expect big things and great things out of me for  the next coming year.  And all the while you knew that two weeks later I was going to get laid off.  The fuck?  Oh man, we're excited.  E-Rock's putting on his Wonder Woman costume for everybody.  And then we're going to give him a fluffernutter hat. 
[00:40:00]  How old are we?  Opie and Anthony, 877-212-O-N-A.  Just before the break, Jim Norton was saying that he's loving Obama.  Now, it sounded like you were a little irritated with him yesterday.  Yeah, I think you're right.  You said it's going to be a love-hate thing like with his foreign policy with Muslim countries.  I think he's going to annoy me.  Guantanamo annoys me, but he is Wall Street's worst nightmare.  He's scumbags.  He's vultures.  He's their worst nightmare.  Where he's talking about the fact that these guys are getting bonuses in this toilet economically. 
[00:40:30]  And a couple of things have, I think, really pushed people to the brink, which is Bernie  made off this face that they can put on hating.  The new moron out there on Long Island, too.  There's another one that built a bunch of people out of money.  A couple hundred million, I think.  A couple hundred million.  And then there's the city jet, the city core jet, or whatever it was.  And he's just saying that's the height of your responsibility.  It's shameful. 
[00:41:00]  Which are kind of harsh words coming from the president.  Talking about the voters?  Oh, don't be so fresh.  But he's talking about things like that.  And Senator Chris Dye, he's a Connecticut Democrat, of course.  He heads up the Senate Banking Committee.  He vowed at a Capitol press conference to seek return of the bonuses.  Now, I don't know if they're going to get that.  But the fact that they may put such pressure on these companies, where if you got a bailout  and you still gave out bonuses, I'm hoping they threaten to take the bailouts back.  The fact that a company would give a guy a bonus after getting bailed out, it's just, 
[00:41:30]  it's like, we're just a bunch of suckers as Americans.  We're a bunch of dummies.  And people are, it's, they said it's like an all-time high, how much people really hate  corporations and hate their corporate mentality.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, when it's business as usual in this kind of economic problems, with the  economic problems that we're in right now, you know, you can't have these guys with these  multi-million dollar bonuses after they're getting bailed out.  I mean, that's, you know, that's not the, everyone thinks, oh, it's the government's money 
[00:42:00]  and you shouldn't do that.  No, it's, it's, it's your money.  It's the country's money.  It's, it's the people's money.  And, uh, it was given to, to you, uh, thinking you're going to be responsible with it.  And then you just keep doing the same mistakes that put you in that situation in the first  place.  It's ridiculous.  It's like you're a parent with a stupid kid that keeps doing the same, making the same  mistake.  Send them to that stupid Sylvan Learning Center.  Go learn something stupid.  The president responding to a new report that revealed bank execs approved more than $18 
[00:42:30]  billion in bonuses last year.  Now, this was as the government forked over billions in bailout funds.  President Obama says that this is not the time for big payouts.  They have to start acting in a more responsible fashion if we are to, together, get this economy  rolling again.  Steve from Big Short.  What did he say?  Hey, where's half a Tundra woman? 
[00:43:00]  Goddamn Steve.  Half a Tundra woman.  Nice.  And I know Steve is, uh, celebrating today.  Yeah?  I want to wish Steve, uh, happy.  I don't know.  What Nazi birthday is it?  Well, no.  In 1933, uh, Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor of, uh, Germany.  So, uh, for Steve, I think it's a big day.  I just want to say, uh, um, happy Hitler is chancellor day. 
[00:43:30]  He's a big fan of the era.  And he says, thanks, Ant.  He's a big fan of the era, uh, like I am.  Yeah.  He's the guy that, uh, he's my go-to guy now as far as memorabilia goes.  Uh-huh.  Like if I need memorabilia from the era, which I like to call it the era.  He knows where to go to get it.  Uh, yeah.  He, he knows what's, uh, legit.  Nice.  What's like fake stuff that people are trying to pawn off as real.  Sure.  So he's, uh, he's the guy.  I'm going to have to take him along, uh, when I go visit Germany as a little tour guide. 
[00:44:00]  Uh-huh.  Because he knows everything about everything.  You know, from the era.  Hey, your boy, uh, Hannity got blasted by Stewart.  What?  Maybe we can find the audio, according to Fast Freddy.  Wow.  Jon Stewart smashed Sean Hannity last night.  Good stuff.  How do you smash him?  Worth getting.  And I like Hannity.  Fast Freddy's saying he likes Hannity, but Stewart smashed him.  Mm-hmm.  That's a nice little battle right there.  Well, all right.  I'd have to hear it.  Ew, the Pink Panther is ringing the bell on Wall Street. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, Jeremy, look.  And it's for the Pink Panther, too.  Oh, that's funny.  They should open a casket and violate and then dump out a body.  And then Steve Martin should point at it with his phony black wig and go,  Look, we have made it to ours now.  We have made it to ours.  He should be thrown in jail for spending what is stolen money.  He stole that character.  Yeah.  You know, we didn't get to the phone calls yesterday,  but we talked about the Pink Panther, and some of the younger demos were calling in and saying, 
[00:45:00]  Hey, those movies are hilarious.  Everyone in my high school loves them.  Yeah.  Look, the problem we have being older is the fact that the younger listeners have no clue where that comes from,  for the most part.  Yeah.  And it was done brilliantly by a guy named Peter Sellers,  who most people have forgotten at this point.  I saw the first one.  It wasn't funny.  I watched it.  It's just corny.  Yeah.  It was like it was a cornball movie.  But if you're in high school, of course, I would laugh at that if I was in high school. 
[00:45:30]  But that's where our frustration comes from, you know?  Yeah.  Go invent a new character and make it funny and make it your own.  Yeah.  You're a comedian, man.  Good luck.  You're a comic.  Yeah.  You're supposed to be original and creative, and you're just redoing comedies.  Mm-hmm.  You suck, Steve.  Let's say hi to Tim in Pennsylvania.  Tim, you got something for Jimmy?  Well, yeah, I'm not really mad at him.  But he said before, oh, I'm so proud of Obama that he, whatever he said.  I said I like, I like, hold on, dude.  I didn't say I was so proud of him, like he's my nephew. 
[00:46:00]  I said I'm happy that he's taking this stance in this particular case.  Yeah.  But he's doing the same thing by wanting Congress to sign up in this stimulus package  that was so full of pork, so full of irresponsible spending.  You know, these Wall Street guys, half of their money sometimes comes from these bonuses.  Now, that is true.  I was going to bring it up, but a lot of these guys don't have giant salaries.  I understand that.  It's based on performance, which I don't know how they make a bonus based on performance 
[00:46:30]  in this day and age.  Right.  But, yeah, like, I forgot what company it was, but the guy went from a salary of well  over $10 million.  He cut his salary back to $10,000 a year, and he's just bonus-based.  Okay.  Well, if the bottom line, I don't know how it works on every case, but I will say, if  the country is bailing you out with billions of dollars, and you're an executive, and you're  getting a bonus, there's something wrong with that. 
[00:47:00]  You made a mistake somewhere if your company is in that position.  And I think there's...  Look, I understand about the pork barrel thing.  I don't disagree with you, man.  You're right.  But that doesn't mean...  You admit you're wrong.  I don't...  No, it's not about being wrong.  Oh, my God.  He just throws that out at you.  No, but it's just...  No, I won't because...  Okay, because I'm really not.  I still like the fact that he did that.  I can like that and not like the pork thing.  There's not a gun to my head going, make a decision, bucko. 
[00:47:30]  Well, we're looking at the stimulus package a little deeper, and the latest is $150 million  for honeybee...  What?  Insurance.  Honeybee insurance.  What's the honeybee insurance all about?  And how does that stimulate the economy?  Two honeybees, they come to an intersection, one clips the other one.  Eh.  Well, there's a problem with the bees.  They're dying.  All right.  I'm going to steer clear from animal jokes.  Look at the pink panther, and it's now behind...  Oh, he's now on show of the news.  That's a man in an outfit.  Is that a real panther?  It should rip their heads off. 
[00:48:00]  Why does somebody in an outfit, what he's doing, he's putting his arms up just like  a retard dancing.  Yeah, any time you get in a big kind of a...  Shaking, like trying to be cute.  Furry, mascot-type costume, you've got to act like a queer.  Dude, how great...  How much would you love to see somebody, like it's a bus in Jerusalem, just run on with  a bomb strap and tackle that stupid panther?  You'd just see shards of fur.  Get him in here.  Nails all over.  Get him in here.  I'll rip the head right off the guy and then stomp it to death. 
[00:48:30]  No problem.  Is Wonder Woman down there?  Is Wonder Woman ready to make her appearance or what?  Where's Wonder Blimp?  Get her in here.  Are we almost ready?  What?  So the honeybee insurance, yeah, the bees are dying and the scientists have no idea why.  Bees, they're dying.  And I guess bees are very important to our survival or something, I don't know.  To the food.  I saw it on the Discovery Channel once.  Is this going to create jobs?  Yeah, how does it create jobs there, Stunt Brain?  Yeah, this is what Jack Cafferty was going off on this yesterday, saying, how is this going 
[00:49:00]  to create jobs?  But he's a curmudgeon.  Yeah, he is.  We kind of like him, but he's a curmudgeon.  And let me tell you something.  You could twist and pervert any money that goes to anything to it'll create jobs.  You could BS your way through anything and say, well, this, this, this, eight degrees  of separation and you have a job.  We're talking a stimulus package that in an emergency situation where it's supposed to  stimulate the economy quickly.  What's the way of doing that? 
[00:49:30]  This ain't it.  What is a way of doing it?  Just get jobs and stuff like construction?  You know something?  Yeah, things like that.  Or, or, how about...  How do you know this doesn't help get jobs?  Honeybee insurance?  Yeah, how do we know?  Well, what are they saying about the honeybee?  How long have you been traipsing this earth?  I've been around for 44 years.  40 years.  I've never known a beekeeper.  I'm getting close to 40.  I've never known anyone that knows a beekeeper.  Supposedly, they're very important to our food supply.  Yeah.  It's a bee.  So maybe if you insure the bees, then maybe some of these companies won't go out of business 
[00:50:00]  that are producing your...  I don't know.  I don't know.  We're bringing in the Australian bees.  Oh, that's always good when we bring other animals over from other countries.  It always works well 50 years later.  Yeah.  Someone has an idea to put a dumb, like, what?  A little fish they put in water to eat some algae.  The Africanized honeybee?  No, what's the shell one that is pretty much destroying...  Oh, the zebra mollusk?  The zebra mollusk.  Yes.  Look that thing up. 
[00:50:30]  Destroying the Great Lakes.  What?  The zebra mollusk is...  Completely destroying the Great Lakes.  Introduced to the Great Lakes and it's...  They introduced it and it decided to just eat everything and it has no predators and, you know,  somebody didn't figure that one out and they don't know what the F to do.  What does a zebra mollusk do?  Look, it just takes over everything in sight.  Wait, is that a cluster of them?  Yeah.  Wow.  And we do this all the time when we introduce animals into this country.  Do they bite people?  Do they bite... 
[00:51:00]  I love your childlike little questions.  Do they bite people?  No, they're like a clam, basically, or like a mussel.  Clam.  Not like clams.  Clams don't multiply...  How great would that be?  They multiply like ivy on the side of your wall.  The cluster of them is on your bedpost.  Yeah.  They look like punched wax lips.  They're just a complete pain in the ass.  And what's that other animal we introduced?  It's a fish that walks out of water and eats your dog and then goes back in  and they don't know what the F to do with those things. 
[00:51:30]  Eat your dog.  Well?  I think it's called some kind of dog fish.  I think that was a movie.  I have to look that way.  No, it's some kind of...  No, there is a...  A Japanese something.  But the kudzu vine was not supposed to be here and look what it's done to the south.  Don't act like we all immediately...  Yeah, yeah.  The kudzu vine is what you see growing all along the side of the road in the south  and it wasn't a native plant.  Somebody brought it in and suddenly...  And what is it doing?  It's just overgrowing and taking over the natural vegetation, which is bad for the ecosystem.  Same way the Africanized honeybees are now ripping up the south. 
[00:52:00]  They're killer bees.  They're fine.  They've got insurance.  By the way, according to Kyle in Texas, Einstein once said,  when bees die, we die.  Did he really say that?  Yes.  The bees are extremely important and they are going away.  Kyle, go ahead.  I already said...  No, he said as bees go, we go.  And, like, the big problem is, is out west there's a giant bee guy or whatever,  and he sells those to huge farmers and crops, cross-pollinate all kinds of produce and goods. 
[00:52:30]  And the pesticides are killing whatever it is that trains the bees to get back to their hives.  So it kills, like, their nervous system, and it's like pesticides versus bees.  They haven't found that.  They haven't identified that yet, sir.  The Collapse Colony Disorder, they first were blaming on cell phone towers,  and now they're trying to see if it is related to a pesticide. 
[00:53:00]  Cell phone towers?  Yeah, because they sell signals.  The bees transmit signals.  That's how they direct each other.  We have enough of the bees because we need to make our phone calls.  Yeah, we need to text.  We need to text.  That's...  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  Whenever you hear a buggy in your phone, it's the bees.  It's the bees.  Oh, my God.  Well, this guy's getting attacked by bees.  Listen to him.  Hey, Anthony, you know, one of your favorite Republican senators of Utah is probably happy about that 150 million.  Yeah.  They have a giant bee laboratory out there in northern Utah. 
[00:53:30]  It's a big laboratory.  Sure.  All right.  All right, thanks, Kyle.  Your phone just sucks.  Call back any time.  I'm not that educated on the bee problem, to tell you the truth.  It's kind of scary.  When I was drinking some beers out by my hot tub last summer, there were bees all over the place.  Really?  Remember that?  No.  Bees everywhere.  Bees?  No, there was a seal when I was in your pool.  You're saying it was a little chilly.  I didn't see any bees. 
[00:54:00]  Nothing.  I saw me in an overcoat.  Jenny's ice fishing.  It was awful.  Exactly.  I finally figured it out.  When the weather gets nicer, you're cordially invited to come into the scalding hot, hot tub.  Dude, this explains my text message.  I was talking to a girl.  I'm like, what are you wearing?  And she wrote back, zzzz.  Same joke.  Not as good as the second conversation.  You're not quite as good.  Phone off.  Put phone down.  Will someone help me out with the fish that walks out of the water and does horrific things  and then goes back in the water and they can't kill these things? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  It's called the walking fish or the snake head?  Let me go to Eddie on the line.  The snake head.  Eddie.  Yeah, I was just calling to tell you it was a snake head.  I just heard it though.  It's not a land shark.  Well, what does these snake heads do for real?  Maybe they don't eat your dog.  No, they could actually live out of water for like three days and they could crawl across  the land and they could move to each lake or any kind of body of water.  Who would that be able to live in water for three days?  So that's the problem.  It pretty much has no predators and it eats everything, right, Ant? 
[00:55:00]  So you think you could contain them to one little lake or pond, but they say, F that,  I'm getting out of the water and I'm walking somewhere else and then I'm going to populate  that area.  I think I think.  That's it.  There's nothing to eat left in that lake, so they move to the next one.  Yeah, see?  They call them frankenfish.  The frankenfish, now I remember it.  Frankenfish.  Yeah, they call them the frankenfish.  They brought them over from Japan.  It's a pit bull with fins, one article described.  Wait, how do they go from, where's their little fish feet?  They just walk.  The lower fins.  They walk on their fins.  Yeah.  Yeah, they sound like slither along the ground. 
[00:55:30]  They're like what evolved and came out of the water.  Yeah.  They're just there now.  How do they know where to go?  Like, how do you not just find these dead things in a parking lot somewhere headed towards  a Macy's?  Would they know where the next lake is?  I don't know.  It's a good question, Jimmy.  They can't find their way to the White House and eat our new friend there, huh?  What do they do?  There's a big rock through a wall.  Do they turn around and go, all right, back we go.  Back to the lake.  Back to the lake.  I'm going to do it. 
[00:56:00]  Little fish sneakers.  I'm going to open a fish sneaker stand and make a bloody fortune.  They've actually drained small lakes that they suspect they're in in efforts to try and  kill them off.  Good luck.  Are they that bad?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're not good.  Why don't they just hang outside with a mallet and wait for them to wander out?  Yeah.  And just smash them.  Yeah.  I don't know.  What's it look like?  If it's a fish and it's behind a tree looking at you, get it.  Yeah, odds are that's your guy.  You don't have to drain the thing. 
[00:56:30]  Hey, if you see a fish on two feet, that's the guy.  Why don't we do some research on the, what is it called?  The snake head.  Tell me why they're a problem.  And also the zebra mollusk.  By the way, Oop, on the news.  A word I've never been able to say.  Mollusk.  The weather's happening and the pink panther.  Oh, look at that.  It's trying so hard to be cute and dancing across the screen cutely.  Yeah.  You get in that face, ain't it?  Like you're a little embarrassed for it?  I am very embarrassed for it. 
[00:57:00]  I, I, I, ugh.  How great would that, how great would a piece of that pink skull look coming off the back  of a limo in Gilly Plaza?  You just should never redo really good comedies.  Sure no.  We've discussed this many times.  There's movies that should be remade because the technology gets better, what have you.  Mostly for special effects and things like that.  Friday the 13th.  There.  Right, well.  But they redid The In-Laws, which was an amazing comedy.  And that stupid movie, that, that stupid movie, The In-Laws sat on the shelves for years 
[00:57:30]  and they finally put it out and it was a disaster.  Yep.  But Peter Falk and, what's his name, were great in the original.  Alan Arkin.  Yeah, Alan Arkin, sure.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Is, is, is, uh, E-Rock ready?  E-Rock!  It is, well, not, oh, he's in the bathroom waiting.  Why is he taking that?  Why are the boots out here?  Yeah, give him the boots.  He just peeked his head out.  Oh, my God.  Give him everything.  He's got to put everything in it.  And see, give him the little padded bra thing.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Everything.  Everything.  Everyone! 
[00:58:00]  Don't come out yet.  The big reveal after the break.  I, I just saw a little glimpse of him.  Oh, my God.  Put those boots on.  Get the Pal Talk cameras next to the bathroom.  We'll be taking video and snapshots.  But E-Rock is going to come out in his Wonder Woman costume.  And then we're going to make a fluffernutter hat on him.  Trying to keep the hat bit going.  I don't know.  The hat.  The hat.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show Friday.  Heading toward the weekend.  We couldn't be happier. 
[00:58:30]  Jimmy's got tickets going on sale.  I know that's going on.  My show at Artie Lang, February 21st, goes on sale at 9 a.m. this morning at the Tower  Theater in Philadelphia.  Ooh.  LiveMation.com.  It's me and Artie doing our first show together.  This morning?  We're not performing this morning.  We're doing February 21st.  I didn't think you were performing this morning.  That would have been short notice when you're doing a show.  That would be crazy.  Yeah.  Who'd come?  People are working.  I think it's going to go real fast on that one.  I hope so.  That would be fun, though, to book a show at this hour and then have, like, 11 people 
[00:59:00]  show up because it's the last minute.  We announce it's four minutes before we do it.  Give it a try.  You never know.  Oh, you do.  Something different.  We're about to do the big unveiling of E-Rock in his Wonder Woman costume before we give  him the fluffernutter hat.  You can tell it's a Friday, right?  Is O-Band 2 working, so we have a two-camera shoot?  Yeah, let's do the two-camera shoot for the people that are watching the radio show.  Sorry.  All right.  He's working on that. 
[00:59:30]  In the meantime, it's a quickie, but thank God he's finally out because I don't feel  like trying to figure out how to say his name.  That governor in Illinois, Blagojevich.  Blagojevich?  Blagojevich, right.  Blagojevich.  I hate those names where you have to really think before you attempt it.  A J and a G and a Vich.  It's like, get a hold of yourself.  It should just blow off your tongue.  Yeah.  But he's done.  59-52.  59-0.  59-0.  Shut out.  He's done.  Not one guy.  He is a lunatic, man. 
[01:00:00]  They not only threw him out 59-0, they also took a second vote to ban him for life from  the Illinois politics.  You know, when the vote got to 25-0, they should have stopped it.  You think?  You know, it's just unfair.  It's mean.  This is why the guy is completely insane.  If he would have resigned, he would have had a chance to get back into politics down the  road.  This probably would have come up, though.  Good point.  I think the opponent would have brought it up. 
[01:00:30]  But at least it would have gave him a shot at maybe going back into politics.  They not only said, get lost, stupid.  We don't want you in politics anytime soon in this state.  He resigned in shame for trying to sell a Senate seat.  But is this the man you want as your, like, assemblyman?  Yeah, I guess.  He's got to work himself back up.  I guess you're right.  I guess he was in a bad spot no matter what.  But listen to how we...  Comptroller.  Listen to how he talks.  I think we all have one of these people in our lives.  They just talk around. 
[01:01:00]  Like, what do they call that when you just talk around stuff?  Evasive.  Evasive.  Double talk.  Double talk is another one.  Sure.  Don't answer the question.  There hasn't been a single piece of information that proves any wrongdoing.  You haven't proved a crime, and you can't because it hadn't happened.  You haven't given me a chance to disprove a crime.  But so far, a crime has not been proven here in this impeachment proceeding.  How can you throw a governor out of office with insufficient and incomplete evidence? 
[01:01:30]  That's all well and good.  Like this, dummy.  Just like this.  Goodbye.  But he had his chance there.  Tell us why.  Instead of saying, you don't have anything on me.  I'd love to see that speech that he just gave, and then you cut to the front door, and  you just see him fly out, and you hear, and stay out!  Horrible.  Horrible.  Horrible.  How can you do that, and all of a sudden you see 59 hands, and the yeas have it?  Yeah.  I see.  That's how.  Ah!  Okay.  At least you showed me.  You vote, and I go. 
[01:02:00]  Comes down here in New York to do all that press when he had some big problems at home there.  Yeah.  How about you deal with what's going on in Illinois, and then not worry about getting  on The View with Barbara Walters?  Ugh.  He loves the public eye, man.  He loves yapping.  He talked a little too much and sounded a little too crazy.  Well, he'll get a book.  Yeah.  Oh, he'll get a book deal.  He'll get a book deal happening.  Movie.  But then what?  All right.  What are we waiting for?  Let's get her out here.  Yeah.  Let's get A-Rock.  Big reveal. 
[01:02:30]  Our intern.  What's his name?  Paul.  Paul brought in his Wonder Woman costume because he went to a superhero party.  Right?  And, well, we said, A-Rock, you've got to put the Wonder Woman costume on.  So, without further ado, here comes Fatso.  Hey, at least he's playing it up, man.  Wait a minute.  A-Rock just did the Wonder Woman pose and everything. 
[01:03:00]  Why is he wearing his boxers?  Is that your boxers?  All right.  Go back in.  All right.  I stopped.  Back in.  Back in.  What are you doing?  Back in.  Thank you, Jimmy, for noticing.  Back in.  Killing the sex appeal.  Yeah.  Go back in the bathroom and take the boxers off.  Don't cheat.  Yeah.  What are you doing, A-Rock?  What the hell's wrong with you?  You just wrecked the whole moment.  There you go.  No.  No, no.  Yeah, I guess so.  All right.  He looks like an old school wrestler.  He does. 
[01:03:30]  I'm trying to remember.  Just one to make the joke better.  Like Bruno San Martino.  Look how horrible he looks in that get-up.  There.  E-Rock, come on over here.  He's spreading his cape.  Yeah, he's doing the pose and everything for everybody.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  We'll have pictures up on onaradio.com in a little bit.  Able to leap zebra mollusks.  Look, on the floor at the buffet.  Oh, he's got his lariat of truth. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, boy.  His little lasso of truth there.  You got to watch out.  Give me the good pose, all right?  All right.  All right.  He's going to...  We're all taking pictures for our...  Oh, God.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Oh, you're just awful.  And instead of Wonder Woman's invisible plane, he has an invisible compilation of work.  All right, now, Larry, put the lasso of truth around yourself and tell us what you ate. 
[01:04:30]  Does he have enough padding?  Thanks.  He just goes, thanks.  What else is he going to say?  He's dressed like that.  Look at the real one.  Danny just popped up a picture of Linda Carter.  Yeah.  In her heyday as Wonder Woman.  And then we look at this.  Oh, you're a mess.  I'm the after shot.  Yeah.  You're the after shot.  Oh.  Of course I might.  I can't take a picture.  I'm going to get all these pictures off my phone.  How are you supposed to twit?  He's got his little...  What's it matter?  How many of you have a... 
[01:05:00]  What's the matter?  Yeah, what's up, B-Rock?  What's going on with the pads?  The wiring is cutting my bosom.  Oh, the wiring is cutting into your...  Well, now you know how the women feel.  See?  Give me the pose again.  That is a colorful little outfit.  I need another pose.  You look silly, B-Rock.  Yeah, silly is a good word for it.  All right, here's the...  All right, hold on, hold on.  I love...  Oh, God.  He spreads his arms apart so the cape is flowing.  He puts his head up and...  He puts his head to the side and looks up like... 
[01:05:30]  I don't know.  For justice.  Like he's...  For justice.  For justice.  For justice, yes.  If there was any justice, you'd fly up that window and hit the pavement.  I know that would be hard to explain, but God damn it, that would be fine.  Wouldn't it be great to just see...  Because what would the people on the street think of seeing him laying there in a pool  of blood, just crumbled in a Wonder Woman costume?  They'd feel good about it and not know why.  Yeah.  And people would be just snapping pictures.  It'd be great.  Good YouTube video.  Might go viral. 
[01:06:00]  Never know, right?  Put the pad back in.  It's sticking up.  I know.  Don't you know how to put bra pads in?  You're killing my rod.  All right.  And this outfit came pre-stained, too.  What do you mean pre-stained?  It was a big stain right here on the cross.  Ew, what is that?  Ew.  What happened there?  Paul's a creep.  That looks like...  Does it look like...  It doesn't have...  It doesn't have a drink stain kind of uniformity to it.  No.  It has kind of a... 
[01:06:30]  It starts out kind of big by the thigh and then tapers off right at where your noughties  are.  That's evidence.  Yeah.  What is that?  I don't know.  My old lady's sister wore it.  She's a bartender.  Oh, wow.  It finally got nailed in it.  Smells like iron.  Two or three.  Two or three have worn it without a washing?  No one...  Oh, my God.  It's going to get a yeast infection.  I'm getting a lot of visual radio rules.  Woo-hoo!  Well, if you're on Facebook or Pal Talk or check out some of our fine websites, you'll 
[01:07:00]  see what we're talking about.  What can I tell you?  It's 2009.  You don't need a visual.  Well, here's what you're going to do.  Go Google Linda Carter.  Yeah.  And then take her out and put a slug in that outfit.  There you go.  There was a belt with it.  I don't know what happened to it.  Yeah.  The belt doesn't fit.  No.  Oh, the belt doesn't fit?  No.  No.  Oh, how did that happen?  All right.  Well, look.  I sent it to all my followers on Twitter.  It's just like a Simpsons belt.  Let's share one of those pictures. 
[01:07:30]  What about the one that Saturn uses?  See, there you go.  Now it's visual for everybody.  There you go.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  There you go.  You get a picture of E-Rock as Wonder Woman.  Do you want to do the Fluffernutter hat or are we going too far now?  No.  Of course we should.  All right.  E-Rock, you're going to do the Fluffernutter hat, too.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  People are asking if you stuffed your crotch.  No.  But did you push your boxers up into the crotch area?  Show Jimmy.  Just now to put it up here. 
[01:08:00]  Jimmy's fat pubis.  Oh.  Okay.  Are you well hung?  Show Jimmy.  Go over there.  Jimmy.  Do you think he's well hung?  No, he's not going to touch you.  Really?  Jesus.  What does he got?  I think he's got one big ball.  Let me poke with my grapefruit.  Oh, yeah.  Come on, Erica.  Yeah, he's going to poke with your grapefruit.  What does he got going on?  Jimmy poked the balls with his grapefruit.  Yeah, but it looks like that grapefruit could be in the front of his pants.  I know.  I think it's just ball. 
[01:08:30]  What do you got going on here, huh?  Yeah, I think it's just a satchel.  Throw out a number.  Just throw out a number.  Yeah.  What do you got going on down there?  Just throw out a number.  I think maybe just six.  Maybe just six.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  He's hung like an old-time bomb.  Spy versus spy, whatever the hell it was.  Spy versus spy bomb, where it's all just round sack and a little stem coming out.  E-Rock rules, though. 
[01:09:00]  I've so turned the corner on you.  You rule.  You've never said no to us.  It's got to be done.  Eric is the greatest.  Can we do the fluff and utter hat, E-Rock, and then we're going to put you on the street  to just horrify everybody again?  Yeah.  What's wrong?  You're getting cut up by the wire.  The underwire is really bugging you.  It's not the underwire now.  Whatever's in the padding, I think, is making me break out.  Oh, wait a minute.  It's starting to itch.  Your breasts are itchy?  I hope it's anthrax. 
[01:09:30]  Crabs.  It's crabs from the suit.  Yeah.  And there's the old-time bomb.  Maybe we can put that up on onaradio.com.  All right.  Why don't you sit down?  We're going to continue doing our show as E-Rock gets the fluff and utter hat.  Hey, I see intern David is here today.  Yeah.  You're in charge of everybody.  Is that correct?  David, why don't you come over?  Yeah, come on over here because we're going to start.  Where's Kenny?  Kenny usually makes the hats for E-Rock. 
[01:10:00]  So I hear you're office manager and also you're the executive intern.  Executive intern and office manager over at the XM side.  And what do those jobs entail?  Executive intern entails me giving out orders to the other interns and telling them what to do.  Orders?  They must love that, huh?  Like when someone has to get the breakfast or get the coffees, I decide who gets to go do the breakfast, who gets to get the coffees, get the newspapers in the morning.  Delegate that responsibility. 
[01:10:30]  Yes, I certainly do.  You're like a trustee.  I certainly do delegate that.  Are you taking the job very seriously?  Yes, I am.  Yeah?  Sam, is he taking the job very seriously?  Extremely seriously.  He's ready to be a leader.  Is he?  And can I ask David, why when you're talking to the mic, are you bent like you're being filmed in a hurricane?  Why don't you just raise the mic up a little bit?  Raise the mic up and stand up straight.  Yeah, you wouldn't seem more comfortable.  That's how the mic is.  I'm just...  Punch it over.  Yes, sir.  I want you to be comfortable.  I hear also that he does the mic checks every morning. 
[01:11:00]  Do we have that audio there?  What do you do for mic checks there, David?  Well, Tim comes in and he has to check all the microphones, so he tells me to check each one.  So I go around to all the mics and make sure that they're working, and Tim checks.  And I just say, like, oh, this is the mic, and talk into it.  Like when he says, oh, okay, go test Anthony's mic, I say, oh, this is Anthony's mic.  Hello, hello, Anthony's mic.  And he checks to see if it works.  And I do that with Jimmy's mic, the guest mic, and the mic's on the couch.  Yeah?  And he'll be just shrugged, because I know he's wondering the same thing I am.  That's why there's no tape.  Oh, here it is.  Thank you. 
[01:11:30]  When David's using the mic for production or doing this, you can tell he went to school for this,  because he puts a fist to his mouth and then to the mic to make sure there's the exact proper distance to the sound clock.  Just like that.  Is that how far you're supposed to be?  That's what I was taught at the good old Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  They told me to put a fist there so that you can have a proper distance.  No, when they said put a fist there, that's not what they meant.  Apparently the kid enjoys German pornography as much as I do. 
[01:12:00]  He's a good boy.  He goes.  He goes.  He goes.  He's cracking up now.  He's cracking up.  He's cracking up.  David, that's what they taught me, to have a proper distance between your mouth and the mic.  Let me try that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Let me try that.  I'm going to put a fist between my mouth and the mic.  Wow, you've been doing this wrong for years.  And now talk.  Wow.  Wow, it's perfect.  I don't like it.  You know what?  The needles aren't pinning.  You've got to go like this.  God, I think the kid just taught me something.  You've got to get right on the mic.  I'm farther away.  Yeah, I like doing this.  And also there is.  Gives me a little bass in my voice.  With talk radio, there is a dynamic depending on what you're doing, if you're yelling or if 
[01:12:30]  you're talking a little softer.  Yeah, you've got to move around.  You do have to kind of move around.  I'm just putting my fist on.  I'm going with the professionals over at the school that I did.  Hey, what's up?  What am I?  All right, you know what?  Ask, let me tell you something about the Connecticut School of Broadcasting, you cocksucker.  Let me tell you something.  I think I'm considered a professional in the business.  Let me tell you the difference.  We're doing it.  Those guys couldn't make it in the business, so they're teaching zeros like Kelly how to 
[01:13:00]  get in the business.  A fist.  What?  What is it, Kenny?  Everyone heard you trying to whisper him a lot.  You whispered into a mic, Kenny.  Way to go, Kenny.  No.  If they were so good, wouldn't they be doing radio?  I guess they taught me wrong.  Thank you.  I love how he said, well, they're professionals.  We're telling them different.  They're not professionals.  And we're not professionals?  We are, but the Connecticut School of Broadcasting might...  We get paid to do the job, not teach the job. 
[01:13:30]  And they get paid to teach it, which makes them professional teachers, but they're not  like professional broadcasters.  It might be a great company.  I have no idea when it comes right down to it, but I would say that most of those guys  want to be doing a radio show, not teaching radio.  They wish they could be, yeah.  Like you, anyway.  Tell them about the famous alumni out of...  Oh.  Yeah, David.  That's what Kenny was whispering to everyone in two countries. 
[01:14:00]  Famous alumni.  Yeah, did they tell you about the famous alumni that came out of there?  Oh, they told me.  And who are they?  Well, Jimmy's good friend, Artie Lang, is at Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  Is Artie at Connecticut School of Broadcasting?  Yes, the same...  Yes, yes, New Jersey, yeah.  It's pretty funny.  Because of that, Jimmy's canceling his gig with us.  I'm going to set fire to Artie's dressing room door when I see him.  Oh, because of that?  That's so rude of you.  That was kind of the joke.  No, I wouldn't burn the man to death because he attended that school.  No, I'm kidding. 
[01:14:30]  Yes.  It was a little joke.  Yes.  All right, so Artie, who else?  A sportscaster you might have heard of named Joe Beningo.  Beningo is my favorite guy at the fan.  I love Joe Beningo.  240 on the fan!  And he wants to cut his own throat when the Jets lose.  He's an animal.  All right, well, that's famous.  Yes, sir.  The list really falls off after Beningo, doesn't it?  Beningo in Ireland.  Also, I don't know if you guys know who Kevin Burkhardt is.  No one does.  He's the guy that he's on SNY now, the med station.  He reports on the field.  Oh, okay, okay. 
[01:15:00]  I don't know him.  No, we have no idea.  No one's ever heard of him.  Mr. and Mrs. Burkhardt know him.  He's a sideline reporter.  He goes on the field during the Mets games and reports from the stands and stuff, and  he doesn't have to be with all the players.  Exactly.  All right, who else?  Pam Oliver?  Who else?  Pam Oliver?  I don't think so.  No, I know.  Not the NFL on Foxwoman, no.  No, I know.  So who else besides?  Artie is by far the biggest name.  Artie and Beningo is doing well.  And there's also Roger All.  Do you know Roger All? 
[01:15:30]  Roger All?  Yeah, the director of sports on Fox 5.  Yes, he used to do a show with Ted Partial.  That's his name.  He's a teacher at Connecticut School of Broadcasting, and everyone says he's like a real famous person.  I've never heard of him in my life.  If someone has to say he's famous and you don't know it, he's not famous.  He's not famous.  According to the instructors there, he's like a legend.  No, he's not.  He has a great cleaning product.  Boy, you really are sticking with that fist length away from the mic thing.  Yes, I certainly am.  He knows.  Well, you want to hear him doing mic checks?  Oh, yes. 
[01:16:00]  You recorded that?  Yeah, this is what he does every morning for everybody.  You recorded it?  What do you think?  Hello, it's Anthony Cumia.  Hello, hello.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Okay, so you're checking my mic.  Correct.  And you have to say, hello, this is Anthony Cumia.  I don't have to say that.  I can say whatever I want to on the mic.  Oh!  Hey!  What am I to say?  I choose to pretend that I'm the person who uses that mic when I'm checking the mic. 
[01:16:30]  I know.  It was uncanny.  Very smart.  Yes, it is.  Because then the person knows whose mic you're checking.  Well, Mike, you're checking it.  Correct.  I like it.  All right.  Hello, it's Anthony Cumia.  Hello, hello.  Hello, hello.  I'm a co-host.  I'm a co-host.  Anthony Jumia.  Hello, I'm a co-host.  I'm a co-host.  Who's the co-host?  The one I'm standing on right now, sitting on right now, is the co-host.  Okay.  Hello, hello.  I'm a co-host. 
[01:17:00]  I'm a co-host.  Co-host.  That's good.  Bob Kelly?  Bob Kelly's a co-host sometimes.  Patrice O'Neill, he's a co-host.  It's a guest mic, dummy.  The color of this microphone's cable's yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow.  Now green.  This cable is green, green.  Hello, green, green, green.  Hello, I'm Jimmy Norton.  Hello, hello.  He's got a little voice.  Hello.  I like it.  It sounds good. 
[01:17:30]  All right, guys.  It's Opie today.  Opie.  Opie Hughes.  Never calls himself that, by the way.  That's all right.  Whatever.  I forgot the quotes.  I hear you doing staff impressions.  Oh.  Oh.  You sort of heard.  I sort of heard a little Jimmy there, so.  Yeah, I tried to do a Jimmy Norton voice there.  I mean, I'm not that easy to do, but, I mean, it's like, hello, I'm Jimmy Norton.  Hello.  Hello.  Jimmy Norton.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Who else do you do? 
[01:18:00]  Kenny.  Oh, you do Kenny?  Uh.  Yes, I did an impression of Kenny.  All right, let's hear it.  You guys got to look at me, like, because it's more of an impression, basically, like, looking.  Sure, of course.  All right.  Do Kenny.  I'll do an impression of Kenny.  That's my impression of Kenny, because he's always sleeping in his chair.  We got it.  He's always sleeping in his chair.  That's good.  Oh, that's good.  It's not like the bosses are listening or anything.  That's the best.  Way to blow up his spot.  That's the best thing to do, take an impression of somebody from when they're, like, sleeping  and not really doing anything. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  That's the same impression, by the way, of everyone else who's sleeping in the world.  Yeah.  Here's my impression of every human who sleeps.  Sorry, David.  It's all right.  I know it's everyone sleeping, but...  What do you do, Steve, too?  Yeah, see if I just, like, run really fast out the door, because he's always, like, rushing  out the door to do something, to, like, go in here and tell someone an important message.  Can we put a door that goes out to the side of the building?  Hold on.  That impression of Kenny should be your impression of Steve working. 
[01:19:00]  Wow, you are killing David today.  It's really funny.  Why is that funny, though?  It is.  I don't know.  I mean, Jimmy's a very funny man, but why is that joke in particular funny?  Of course it is.  It just is.  Are you saying because it's accurate?  I guess so.  I don't want to say anything on the air, but I guess I just did.  No, you're allowed to.  You can say whatever you want.  Do you think Steve's a good worker?  He's a good worker.  What did you say right before we went on the air?  I don't want to say anything about him on the air.  No, on the air, you're allowed to say anything. 
[01:19:30]  You're safe.  They should have taught you that at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  Yeah, you know, the professionals.  Yeah.  On the air, you're safe because what you say can be interpreted as entertainment value,  no matter how realistic it is.  Uh-huh.  But you're safe, so you could say it.  What did you say before?  About what?  About Steve.  I just was telling my impression of how I'm...  Do you think he's good?  He's all right.  Do you think he's good?  No.  He's all right, though. 
[01:20:00]  Wow.  He wouldn't do too long in the interrogation room, David.  Wow, at least you know he's not an Al-Qaeda mastermind.  He's all right.  Do you really think he's all right?  Yeah, he's just all right, yeah.  Do you think he's all right?  Yeah.  David.  You're on the air.  You're safe here.  This is a safe place.  Yeah.  Very safe place.  Now, answer Sam's question.  Do you think Steve's good?  Sometimes.  He could be good sometimes.  Like when?  I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  Percentage of good to bad.  Yeah.  What would you say?  How much percent good?  Remember, you're in a safe place.  You're in front of us.  We make all final decisions, my friend.  You say sometimes he's good.  Is it sometimes, you know, what percent of the time?  There he is.  What percent of the time?  Don't let him intimidate you.  He's right there in the phone booth.  Don't intimidate the witness.  I can't do it.  Opie and Anthony are on your side.  That's right.  What percent?  It's the Opie and Anthony show, not the Steve show.  I can't do it.  We're asking you.  I can't do it.  It's not right.  We are asking you, what percentage?  I can't do it.  What percentage of the time is he good? 
[01:21:00]  What percentage for real?  I can't do it.  He's right there.  Say a number.  Come on.  What percentage?  Now he's behind me.  What percentage?  Now he's like putting his face to my, now he's blowing in my.  Dave, is it closer to zero or ten?  No, that's more than ten.  David.  More than ten?  Yeah.  What's it less?  David's, Steve's right on top of David.  I know.  Is it less than twenty?  Yeah, he's less than my, I'd say, he's gonna, he's gonna like beat me up or something. 
[01:21:30]  Or he's not.  I don't know.  I'd say probably, it's not as bad as people are making it out to be.  Probably like fifty.  You know what?  Fifty?  Yeah.  What did Sam ask you?  Sam said, is Steve good?  Yeah.  What was your answer?  Is he good?  He's alright.  How good is he?  He's alright.  No, what did you say?  David.  He's alright. 
[01:22:00]  David.  What did you say?  What'd you say?  He's alright.  That's not what he said.  I didn't mean what I said, though.  I said no, but I didn't mean that.  Why didn't you mean it?  I don't know, I'm just joking around.  I didn't mean that.  Alright.  Why could present that?  Whatever you just said.  What percentage?  Fifty.  No.  Yes, yes.  David.  Yes.  Steve's intimidating the hell out of him.  He's in here.  And even with that, David can only admit that it's fifty.  Yeah, I know, right? 
[01:22:30]  I just want to acknowledge that.  Even with intimidation, that's not a family grade.  Right.  Steve wasn't around.  I think that number would be lower in David's eyes.  Alright, we've got to start the fluffernutter hat on EROC as we go to break here.  David, congratulations, by the way, on your new duties.  You're doing them very well.  Oh, I thank you.  If I may say one thing, Steve wanted me to say what I said about Travis.  He wants you guys to know what I was saying about Travis.  What did you say about Travis? 
[01:23:00]  Oh.  Because we're on the topic of how do I rate the staff members here.  So Travis, I would say, didn't do any work.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  But Travis isn't even here to defend himself today.  Of course, he's slacking off.  Yeah.  Wow.  Taking the vacation day.  I guess apparently, David, you're not privy to the emails on a nightly basis that we all  get to share in.  No, I'm not privy to those.  Where Travis pretty much gives a rundown of all the big stories of the world. 
[01:23:30]  He doesn't email the interns, no.  Ooh.  So what you're saying is you're speaking out of complete ignorance.  I'm just speaking out of what I see.  I don't see these emails, so I don't know about them.  So you don't see what he's doing on his off time.  No, I do not.  As he goes on his computer and other things and finds things.  Danny's got some names.  I don't see that, no.  Aside from not being on the emails, you're also not in the office before the show, nor in 
[01:24:00]  Travis's phone booth during the show.  No, I'm not.  Nor in Travis's area at the XM Sirius side of the show, so how would you even really  know what anybody does around here?  Let me tell you something.  Because you don't work too closely to any of us.  That's true.  I'll tell you something, David.  No matter what time I get in here, sometimes I'm in here early.  Travis is always at his desk when I walk in.  Doesn't matter what time it is.  And he is working diligently.  Nick Carter usually at his desk when you walk in.  Nick Carter. 
[01:24:30]  Nick Carter.  He loves that, Jimmy.  He loves that one.  That's good.  I like that guy.  He's a good guy.  To base your, what do you base your opinion on?  I'm just basing my opinion on one day, probably just one day in the very beginning of my internship  when I saw Travis just staring at his face in the phone booth.  I'll tell you what he's basing it on.  He's basing it on, he, I guess to David, the amount of work that you do depends on how  much you're liked by that person.  So, if Travis really doesn't like you, then I guess he really doesn't do any work. 
[01:25:00]  You know, I'm kind of half and half with you, so I guess I must work just half good.  What do you think about Danny?  Do you think he works a lot?  Yes, I certainly do.  Danny's always working hard.  Really?  Danny, Travis doesn't like him?  At this point in time, I don't think much of anybody really enjoys David too much.  I love David.  I love the kid.  Sam's got his hand raised, too.  Well, because you guys just have your little on-air time, and then it's back home.  But we actually have to deal with him.  But he's the executive intern, Danny.  He is the executive intern.  You don't just get that position. 
[01:25:30]  He earned it.  I've got to know my role.  I'm sorry.  Are you putting that on your resume when you go to look for a job that you are the executive  intern?  I'm going to switch my resume to executive, yes.  Executive intern?  I had just intern.  Now I'm going to switch to executive intern slash office manager.  Okay, executive intern.  And then you have to put duties that you did as an executive intern.  What do you list?  I'm going to list, and telling the other interns what to do.  Good.  Giving out the order.  Giving the orders to other interns. 
[01:26:00]  Other interns.  Do you?  Like this old man that is interning.  Yes, correct.  The 38-year-old.  Yes.  The 38-year-old.  With two kids.  With two kids.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you listen to the executive intern?  Yes, I have to listen to the executive intern.  Yeah.  Sam is forcing all interns to listen to the executive intern.  Sam is instigating.  You know who's involved with this.  Sam is the one that appointed me executive intern.  Of course he is.  He appointed you?  He appointed me, yes.  Oh, appointed. 
[01:26:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  So he appointed you.  Boy, I didn't know you had that in your job description, Sam.  Well, he's just a dick.  I love it.  Of course he is.  What I really like, David and me, Sirius came and told all the interns that they all  had to have a mentor and that it should probably just be Steve.  So everybody just put Steve as their mentor.  So he just signs the paperwork, except David, because David said Steve wouldn't do a good  job as his mentor.  And put a set of balls on this kid. 
[01:27:00]  And then asked if I would be his mentor instead.  Wow.  He actually asked?  Oh, wow.  That's nice.  Yes, they said.  He went from a bear to a viper.  Yes, we had a meeting with HR people from Sirius.  Yeah.  And you told them you didn't think.  They said Steve will be everyone's mentor.  And I said, I don't want Steve to be my mentor.  You told HR that?  Yes, I did.  You pretty much ratted out Steve.  Yes, I did.  No, I didn't rat him.  No, I didn't rat him.  I just said, I don't want Steve to be my mentor.  Do you understand that that negatively impacts Steve to the superiors? 
[01:27:30]  I asked them, can I have Sam as my mentor?  And they said, who's Sam?  And I explained to them.  And I showed them.  And they said, oh, okay, Sam, you can be okay.  Not good.  Sam is my mentor, yes.  Paul has something.  Oh, look at this.  Oh, God, I'm sorry.  Paul, you have something?  I just wanted to point out that some of David's executive duties does include removing staples  from pieces of paper and then re-stapling them after they've been filed and scanned.  Got to be done.  And that you have to tell them that every day, how to take the tape staples out and re-staple  again.  Why are you re-stapling stuff there, executive intern? 
[01:28:00]  Those are the rules for all the darn paperwork that we've got to clean up.  All the darn paperwork.  Radio-friendly.  We've got to clean up the mess of one specific individual who messed up all the paperwork and  threw it all over their office.  We've got to fix it all up and it's all unorganized.  Who did that?  A certain individual that's no longer with us.  Oh, oh, mess.  Oh, okay.  Yes, a certain individual that's no longer with us threw all the paperwork all over the  office and messed it up and we have to reorganize it and scan it and fix it. 
[01:28:30]  Why did he throw it all over?  So he didn't do a good job.  He wasn't doing his job.  Oh, my God.  So now we've got to fix it all up.  So that's why I'm un-stapling so that they can scan it.  Un-stapling, scanning, and then stapling again.  Stapling again, then filing them, storing them by year and by alphabetical order.  He doesn't scan.  He just pulls the staples out and then puts new staples in.  Oh, okay.  You're not in charge of the scanning part.  No, I'm not in charge of the scanning.  What, do you delegate that?  Why aren't you doing that part?  Do you delegate that responsibility to someone else?  Yes.  More like he's not willing to learn how to do the scanning. 
[01:29:00]  Do you know how to scan?  Yes, I know how to scan.  So why don't you scan?  I don't know.  I just kind of decided on my own.  Okay, I'm going to staple.  I'm going to un-staple.  I'm going to do the alphabetizing.  Now, about the time you get in, I've heard about this, too.  Now, what time do the interns report to you?  We are required to meet Sam at XM at 4.30 a.m.  Sam, 4.30 a.m.  David, what time do you come in?  I come in at 4.40.  No, you don't come in at 4.40.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Your mentor is saying you don't come in at 4.40. 
[01:29:30]  That's not true.  I come in at 4.40.  You come in at 5 o'clock.  Mentor?  I do not come in at 5.  Everyone is saying you come in at 5.  Generally, he arrives around 4.45, which he says.  I don't think it's necessarily true most of the time.  But today, he got here at 4.45 because we were walking from XM to CBS.  Even though he saw us, he went to XM anyway.  And when questioned, he explained he had to go up to XM, even though we were already there,  to make sure the other interns didn't forget anything.  Oh, Jesus.  Takes his duty seriously. 
[01:30:00]  So, why do you come in later than the other interns?  I got no explanation for that.  But you're the executive intern.  That's one of the perks.  You're trying to make up your own hours?  No, I'm not trying to.  No.  I think, David, that's one of the perks of being the executive intern.  I don't know what he just did.  I don't know what he's whispering to you while I'm talking to you.  He's the executive intern.  I think that's one of the perks of being the executive intern.  So, that's a perk you're able to just come in later. 
[01:30:30]  I guess it is.  Are you going to be supervising the fluffernutter hat that we're putting on EROC to make sure  it's done right?  Only if interns are doing it.  So, if interns are involved, you supervise.  Yes, I don't supervise any of the staff members.  Only interns.  Only interns.  Paul, yes, one of our interns.  I would just like to point out that David's supervision usually involves asking one of  us what he should be doing.  But you're the executive intern.  You're the executive intern.  Why are you asking them?  Yeah, but then he doesn't do it anyway.  So, he'll ask us what to do, we'll tell him, and he won't do it. 
[01:31:00]  That is not true.  I do what I'm told.  Because he's the executive.  He doesn't have to listen to you.  Right.  I forgot.  The reason why I asked him is because the paperwork project I were involved in was explained.  It's a project.  Yes, it was a project.  It was explained to Paul several times and not to me.  So, Paul is the one that knows what to do with that project.  I was never explained what to do for that project.  You're just getting information.  You're not asking for directions.  Correct.  If you weren't on the air right now, what would you be doing as executive intern?  I'd probably... 
[01:31:30]  This second?  Yeah.  If you weren't on the air.  Eating chocolate.  I would never do a thing like that.  Well, of course not.  What would you be doing?  I would probably be thinking of duties to give to other interns.  Like what?  Yeah, like what?  I just want to know what you'd be doing as executive intern right now if you weren't in front of that mic.  That's a really good question.  Oh, my God. 
[01:32:00]  Why are you laughing?  Because it's funny.  David, do you see yourself more as a non-air guy?  Is that what your heart is?  You're an on-air guy.  As opposed to a behind-the-scenes cutting up audio on CS.  Yes, definitely.  Cutting up audio.  You don't need to learn to do that.  He has no desire to cut up audio.  I learned how to do that at Connecticut Schools of Broadcasting, but when I finish it, I'm like, oh, that's not for me.  Is your last name Brent?  My last name's not Brent, no.  You got kind of that vibe going. 
[01:32:30]  My last name being Brent?  Yeah, David Brent from the office.  Oh, I didn't get it.  I'm not as professional.  You got it.  You got it, yeah?  You got it.  You got it.  He's cracking up.  He's cracking up.  He's laughing.  It's having a laugh we have around here.  There's been a rape up there.  We do have to take a break.  We're like 20 minutes late because of the executive intern, David.  All right, David.  I don't have to say anything.  It's a scream.  Like it's madness all the time.  We have to take a break. 
[01:33:00]  We can continue with that.  So E-Rock's going to get his Fluffernutter hat.  There are going to be interns involved with this, David, so you supervise them.  Kenny will also be applying the Fluffernutter to make a hat as E-Rock continues being dressed as Wonder Woman.  Fluffernutter is deceiving.  That's Fluff and peanut butter.  Will this only be marshmallow Fluff?  Okay.  Okay, so it's just Fluff.  It's a Fluff hat.  I hated Fluffernutter's as a kid because I never liked peanut butter, but I used to love just Fluff on bread. 
[01:33:30]  Really?  A little Anthony trivia for you.  How do you not like peanut butter?  I hate peanut butter.  Peanut butter rules.  I despise peanut butter.  Even a lot.  I was eating peanut butter last night on Celebrate.  It's a hit.  It's amazing.  Hate it.  It's hated.  Looks like Doody.  Don't like it.  It looks like Doody.  So what?  So does Hershey bars.  So does Snickers.  Only have to eat chicken wings.  They're...  Oof.  You're almonds.  Boy, almonds.  Oh, almonds.  That's quite a problem.  Yeah.  All right.  Quick break, and yeah, we'll continue with the nonsense. 
[01:34:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton's got tickets going on sale today at 9.  Free at the 21st of February show with Artie Lai of the Tower Theater.  Opie and Anthony.  It's Friday.  I'm looking at E-Rock.  He's dressed as Wonder Woman.  Yeah.  I finally was able to send the picture to everybody following me on Twitter.  It's gorgeous.  It's Opie Radio.  I had a problem for a while, but it's finally there.  And now we're making a fluff hat. 
[01:34:30]  Anthony, correct me.  It's not a fluffernutter hat.  It's a fluff hat.  Fluffernutter was the combination of fluff and peanut butter on bread.  You'd make a fluffernutter sandwich.  Right.  But just marshmallow fluff on bread was what I used to eat, and it was very hard to spread  on bread.  Which, by the way, yeah, would just be a nightmare to try to make a sandwich out of that stuff.  You'd get very pasty.  But it was worth it in the end because of the goodness that was involved.  Marshmallow-y goodness.  Yes.  Now, we also have intern David, who we learned today is an executive intern. 
[01:35:00]  He's in charge of all the other interns.  Executive intern.  And, of course, this came about because Sam's a dick.  Right.  And, uh...  Sam is a manipulating little, uh, class.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're upsetting, David.  David.  Aw.  Really fast because we're going to do a little news and stuff as we continue.  The freaking fluff hat is just melting down the sides of the vlog.  Oh, it is starting to melt, isn't it? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  It's pulling my hair.  It's pulling the hair.  You look like my three favorite porno movies.  Don't move your head forward because now it's starting to drip in.  It's going to drip in your eyes in a few minutes here.  Kenny's doing a very good job as he applies the fluff to E-Rock's head.  Move the mic closer, Eric, and we talk so.  The Wonder Woman tiara is actually helping because it's like a cake mold.  Yeah.  It's almost holding it in there.  Yeah.  Uh, David?  Yes.  The interns are kind of helping out here.  Are they doing a good job?  Uh.  What is your problem? 
[01:36:00]  You obviously have a problem.  Well...  What's the problem?  You're eight fists away, David.  Yeah.  What's your problem?  Eight fists.  I'm just...  What's the...  You're supervising the interns.  I'm sort of supervising, but they're just pretty much doing their own thing.  Well, but you're supposed to...  You're a supervisor, for God's sake.  What do you want them to be doing?  Well, I wanted Joe over there to actually start applying some of the fluff to E-Rock's  head.  Yeah.  Take the bull by the chauffeur.  Joe just did.  Now he did, yeah.  True joke.  Do you want to fire one of the interns? 
[01:36:30]  We'll allow that today.  You know, the horn.  Oh, sorry.  I'm not listening.  It's okay.  Neither is anyone else.  Well, I just got a blech.  I don't really want to...  Thank you.  Point blank.  Just blech.  And that was kind.  Sam?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you had some.  No?  No.  Okay.  All right.  As they continue applying the fluff to E-Rock...  E-Rock, look at the face.  ...to make a fluff hat.  Because when Kenny moves the fluff around, it pulls my hair.  So as he's trying to even it out, it's pulling my head back and pulling my hair out. 
[01:37:00]  It's very sticky.  Yeah, but here...  Very sticky.  You have so much hair to lose.  Don't even worry about it.  Exactly.  Oh, yeah.  I'm in the minority here.  What's this?  Oh.  Whoa.  Can't even fight back.  It hurts a little bit.  It hurts a little bit.  It hurts a little bit.  I'm not even going to lie to you.  That's all right.  It gets a shot in every once in a while.  I'm going to have a little male pattern balding than be a complete idiot.  Luckily for you, you've got both.  I'm just looking forward...  I'm looking forward to the day Anthony takes the hat off, because, you know... 
[01:37:30]  I take the hat off, by the way.  I'm paying attention.  I just wear the hat all the time, but I take the hat off the second I get my vehicle.  Is it growing?  And then it doesn't go back on until, you know...  Is it looking good back there?  I'm seeing some stubblies.  The hair plugs are coming out.  They're not plugs.  It's individual follicles that have been implanted...  Harvested.  It's artistically in the direction that my hair grows, and it's my natural hair harvested  from the back.  Harvested. 
[01:38:00]  Harvested.  I know.  I know Jimmy hates that.  That's what I say.  And it is starting to speckle.  I see little speckles and little whiskeries coming up.  So it's...  No, it's like when you shave your head.  But the word...  It was from the harvest area and there are speckles.  There's a harvested area where they harvest the hair.  That nest.  I hate the word harvest and nest.  I hate the word nest.  We're nesting.  They're having a tough time keeping the fluff on top of his head.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  It's just starting to drip.  It's dripping.  Yes, Kenny.  Wow.  Hold on.  Fluff on top of his head.  He's melting.  I think that's the best...  Oh, boy, Kenny.  You know.  Oh, boy.  Just trot right over Jimmy.  Why don't you just trample everything that's sacred about this show?  You all right, Jimmy?  Jimmy wants to kill somebody.  Oh, that's fine.  All right.  I was just saying...  Oh, that hurt.  He's really hurting now.  We're going to give it another shot.  He's got fluff on his brain, so it would be a fluff of nothing.  All right.  Not a great one.  Would have been better right off the cuff like that.  Of course it would have, but why not?  Shouldn't you have... 
[01:39:00]  Yes, David?  I have to agree with all you guys.  That's just a bunch of fluff on his head.  It's not much of a hat.  Oh, so you're not happy about the job that is being done by Kenny and your fellow interns.  What do you suggest, David?  Dictate.  Well, it's pretty much just Kenny doing all the work for the hat at the moment.  Well, it's not very, you know, too many hands spoil the hat.  It's not, like, very moldable either.  You're just pretty much...  What they're doing now is almost folding it.  There he goes.  Joe's doing the work. 
[01:39:30]  They're taking it and folding it up.  Whatever's dripping, they're pulling back up on top.  Yeah, he's got...  It's more like a fluff beret than a fluff hat.  I agree.  And every time they pull up the melting fluff, it pulls his hair and he's wincing in pain.  Well, we could turn...  We could change the bit into, like, a fluff Elvis, like...  Elvis hairdo, too.  Hairdo or a pompadour.  We could go...  We could do something a little different.  I love the fact that David jumped in and goes,  Oh, there he goes.  He's doing something.  He's working now, finally.  Right, David? 
[01:40:00]  Right, Opie.  All right.  Really horrendous.  As they continue doing that...  More.  More is coming up.  Oh, it's falling down?  Yeah.  Just let it drift.  It'll really annoy him.  Ah!  Yeah.  His hair's coming out.  Oh, wow.  That is really pulling.  Wow, that stuff could be used for something else other than eating.  You could use that as some kind of a weapon.  That's one of those non-lethal weapons the police should use on people.  Yeah.  Just spray it out of a hose.  Yes.  When they pull the fluffer nutter or whatever it is, the fluff up, the hair is stuck to 
[01:40:30]  the fluff.  And it's pulling out.  Yeah.  It's ripping out of his head.  You're losing hair?  Yeah, a bit.  All right.  I don't know how you're going to get it out of your head.  I don't think warm water's going to do it.  I think there'll be enough resistance.  Yeah.  Like the water...  I don't think it's soluble.  I don't think it's water soluble.  I know what they're doing.  They're like combing his...  The fluff like it's hair.  They keep trying to comb it back and up.  And it rips hair out while it's happening.  It's on Pal Talk 2, eh?  You take the extra and give it to Mike.  Huh?  Take the extra hair and give it to Mike. 
[01:41:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Because you don't have hair.  It's always the person sitting in the fluff seat that has to make the insults.  You want to fall into his eye?  Huh?  It's dripping down.  All right.  Kenny, it's dripping in.  You want to drip down into his eye?  I want it to look like a fluff elephant man.  He's on that all over his face.  No, if it drips into his eye, he's going to look like a fluffer.  I probably wouldn't let it drip in his eye just because of eyelashes and stuff.  That could be a major problem.  That's all right.  You don't need eyelashes. 
[01:41:30]  Look at me being responsible.  What's wrong with me?  All right.  Hey, Joe Torre's got a book out, and we're trying hard to get him on the show next week.  He's doing a lot of press.  Yes, he is.  And, man, it's coming out.  Now the players are fighting back.  First, Joe Torre took his shots in the book that's coming out, and now the players are basically  saying he wasn't a good guy.  Well, Joe Torre never really said much, to tell you the truth, derogatory about the Yankees,  especially.  I mean, he was the skipper of that team.  How many years, Jimmy? 
[01:42:00]  He was the skipper.  I'm going to guess from 96 was his first because Showalter's last was 95.  So I think it was 96 to 2006, 10 years?  He did 10?  Wow.  That's a nice stint with a team like the Yankees.  No kidding.  I mean, you know, so he never really said anything.  They did relatively well during those years, I mean, the tail end of it.  They did great.  Right.  But, you know, I mean, it's just because it's the Yankees that you go, oh, well, you know,  they kind of fell apart at the end.  But any other team that had that record would be phenomenal. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  But he never said anything bad about the players.  You knew when he was unhappy with a player, but he usually spin it like, well, we're working  with them and trying to get some such and such out of a slump or something.  And then he goes to L.A. after he's, I don't know, relieved of his Yankee duties.  A little premature, I think.  I think they could have given him another year.  And I think that pissed him off.  He goes over with the Dodgers, has a good season.  And then writes a book and starts saying some of the stuff that was on his mind during 
[01:43:00]  those Yankee years.  And isn't there some kind of code in sports where you don't talk about the crap that happens  in the locker room?  Wasn't there a famous quote?  Yep.  Stump Brain was saying the quote.  When you go in the Green Bay Packers locker room, there's a sign as you leave.  It says, what you see here, what you say here.  When you leave here, let it stay here.  Ah.  Ah.  And it's one of those unwritten rules, I guess, in sports in general.  Well, now David Wells, because what did he say about Wells? 
[01:43:30]  I called him a fat slob that, no, I'm kidding.  What did he say about Wells?  I forgot.  But Wells was on the radio.  I think he said he was intentionally a wall breaker.  Oh, well, you should just take a microphone.  Well, I had the information.  I figured I'd do it.  See?  Why didn't you ask David first if you should step up to the mic?  Can I talk on the microphone?  Yes, go ahead, Scott.  You can talk.  But David, are you a little annoyed that he didn't ask you and he just kind of jumped  and kind of, you know, messed up the flow of the show a little bit?  He was almost pushing you out of the way.  I'm very annoyed. 
[01:44:00]  What are you going to do about it as an executive intern?  I'm going to make sure that it never happens again.  And how are you going to do that?  I'm just going to be very careful.  I'm going to watch his every move.  Watch his every move.  He did say that David Wells was intentionally like a ball breaker during his time there.  The other guys were maybe, that's how they were, you know, that's how they were.  Kevin Brown was just a ball breaker.  That's how he was born. 
[01:44:30]  But David Wells went out of his way to bus chops and he didn't like that.  You know what, though?  I don't think that was much of a secret.  I think everybody knew David Wells is a loose cannon, kind of a ball breaker.  He'll speak what's on his mind and he's been in trouble for that before.  I think it was also that one playoff game where I think he started like game four of a series  and he has a second inning.  He bowed out because of his bad back and he kind of dumped him out of the playoffs.  Yeah.  Right.  He didn't like that.  Well, now David Wells is basically saying he would punch Torrey in the face if he saw him.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's involved in this clip, but let's take a listen to what Wells is saying. 
[01:45:00]  I'm distracted because the fluff is just melting all over E-Rock's face right now.  Oh, God, I didn't turn around.  It's just horrendous.  It looks like he has a bathing cap in 1920.  Right.  It does.  Yeah, you look like a flapper.  Yeah, from a speakey.  One of those platinum blonde flappers from the speakeys.  It does.  I was thinking it looked like a shower cap.  Yeah.  It's like a Lord Fauntleroy hairdo.  Yeah.  Oh, David. 
[01:45:30]  David's having a proverbial ball in there.  It's turning into a fluff mullet.  Fluff-a-mullet.  Yeah.  It looks like the thing.  Oh, no.  It's dripping down his neck now.  There it goes.  There it goes.  David, tell your interns what to do.  Our fluff hat is getting...  Get up there and fix it.  Quick, quick, quick.  All right.  Someone is suggesting we get E-Rock out on the street because it's cold out there and it  all like...  Oh, that'll solidify it a little better.  Go to the other side.  All right, E-Rock, why don't you hit the street with your fluff mess? 
[01:46:00]  My whole right ear is plugged.  What?  What?  That's what I've heard.  I can't hear.  I'll thrust.  You've got to fix it a little bit, Joe.  It's a losing battle.  See?  David just stepped in.  It's a losing battle.  Now it's in his eye.  Oh, it's over his eye.  It's over his eye.  He's lost an eye.  Oh, no.  All right.  This could be a problem.  He's lost an eye.  All right.  Oh, it's on his eyelid.  You know how sticky...  Oh, no.  All right.  This is trying to be crazy.  Imagine your upper eyelid. 
[01:46:30]  Whenever you blink, you feel sticky in there.  Does that bother you?  Oh, God.  Would that bother me?  Put some...  Wait.  You've got to put some behind his knees, too.  So every time he walks...  Oh, I hate that.  Put some behind his knees.  You want to go outside with this mess, E-Rock?  All right.  Why not?  All right, E-Rock, go outside so it'll solidify a little bit.  Here's what David Wells is saying about Joe Torre.  If you weren't Joe's boy, he could care less about you.  You know, he just had his... 
[01:47:00]  He ran his tight ship the way he wanted to.  You know, don't get me wrong.  He's not a bad manager.  I just thought he was a bad individual because of the fact that he didn't treat everybody the same.  All right.  I remember he went out to say that he would punch him if he saw him.  Yeah.  So there you go.  But I'm looking forward to this book now.  What do you...  What's...  E-Rock looks like he's ready to preside over an English course.  Yes!  That's a good one. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, is it all...  Is it really sticky, E-Rock?  I just made it worse.  What'd you do?  Instead of moving it off my eye, it's now in my eye.  Oh, boy.  All right.  You should wear glasses first, and then you lick them clean.  All right.  Let's take a quick break, and we'll continue.  Get him out on the street.  Yeah.  It'll solidify in the cold weather.  All right.  We'll check in with you guys on the street next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there. 
[01:48:00]  E-Rock looks sad.  Just sitting there, fluff or dutter.  Or fluff is just melting in his eyes.  He can't hear anymore.  We can't even get him outside because it's just dripping everywhere.  It's a complete disaster over there.  It's encasing his head, and where it's going down over his eyes, it's almost like he's got  a furrowed brow.  Yeah.  Like he's angry.  Yeah.  It's dripping down his nose now.  Yeah.  And no one's helping him.  How are you going to get that out of your hair, E-Rock? 
[01:48:30]  I can't hear you.  Here's the fist thing.  You've got to be a fist away, remember?  I have no idea.  I'm probably going to have to shave my head.  Yeah, but you've got to get it kind of out before you can even do that.  I know.  Very hot water will melt that away.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  I just had it on my hand, and it came right off when I put hot water on it.  Yeah.  It should be good.  Yeah.  There you go.  Same thing.  You're going to have to deal with some hot, scalding water on your head.  We could do that on the satellite side. 
[01:49:00]  We'll just dump boiling water on your head.  Because I've had bubblegum on my hand, and it's come right off, and so the hair is the  same thing.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  So he's not going outside.  By the way, next, bubblegum hat.  Bubblegum hat?  Yeah.  We all chew up big, huge things of gum and just slap it in his hair.  Yes.  Yeah.  What if we invite all the listeners down that day?  They all chew bubblegum, and they get to just put it on your hair.  That's a good one.  E-Rock, that's good. 
[01:49:30]  I think someone else on this program needs to step up for once.  Ooh, like who?  I'm thinking, I don't know, somebody with a lot of hair.  You mean step up and have your job?  Maybe not so much on his head, but on his face and back.  Ah, Steve.  Yeah.  Definitely talking about Steve.  Why would you?  What, Sam?  Sam is an idiot.  He goes, he's talking about Steve.  He's definitely talking about Steve.  Just the sarcasm that oozes from him.  Steve, how do you feel about that?  Steve, comment.  Comment, Steve.  Comment.  I think that's a horrible idea. 
[01:50:00]  Thank you very much.  Good one.  Thank you.  They didn't like your improv, Steve.  I know they don't.  You are.  Yes.  All right.  Super Bowl Sunday.  Is it?  Oh, that's right.  I think we did a really good job hyping this game for everybody.  Everybody did.  Everyone's really conscious that it's going on.  Can't wait.  All the parties.  I don't know which one I'm going to go to.  Yeah.  I've been invited to so many parties that people are having. 
[01:50:30]  I was hoping you were going to have one, and you saw what happened during the commercials.  I kind of invited myself to your Super Bowl party that you're not having.  If I was having one other person over to watch it, I'd say, sure, come on over.  Instead of me, my wife, and you just awkwardly sitting there watching the Super Bowl.  There's no one.  Two teams that we don't care about.  It's not even like I care.  Yeah, I don't care about the teams.  They didn't even sell all the commercials.  There's two left.  It's not like.  It's just this year, I could give a crap. 
[01:51:00]  Why is that?  I think a lot of people have.  And some people say because the Giants aren't in there and all that.  No.  There's been other Super Bowls where you don't care about the teams, but you get caught up in the hype.  There's a priority shift right now that I think a lot of people are having.  Yeah.  Like my mental priorities are elsewhere.  They're not on Super Bowl and things like that.  They're on pretty much keeping your job and doing, you know, as good a job as you can, worrying about the economy, just things like that. 
[01:51:30]  There are too many things that I'm preoccupied with right now.  Yeah.  That was a good one, Danny.  There are too many things that I'm preoccupied with to worry about things like the Super Bowl and things like that, you know?  I just don't care.  I could care less.  Even if the Giants were in it.  I'm not, like, a huge Giants fan, so, you know, don't put me in that category where you'd watch.  But I still wouldn't be like, whoop-a-dee-doo, let me get out and get a party going. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  You know, I don't care.  You know, we've got a new president in there that I'm very unsure of, to say the least.  But I don't take it, buddy.  You know?  I give it all up to me.  That's right.  So, you know, there's a lot of things on my mind.  And the Super Bowl, it's kind of back a ways.  You know what people are into?  What?  Yes. 
[01:52:30]  Fluff hats.  No, the fluff hat was a disaster.  Look at this thing.  What does it look like?  It's just dripping everywhere now.  There's no height.  It looks like a 70-year-old guy when he finally finishes.  Just kind of oozing out of the top of his head.  He looks like a birdwatcher who fell asleep.  Yeah, Iroch, you're a mess.  I'm a birdwatcher. 
[01:53:00]  All right.  All right.  All right.  We get it.  He repeats the punch.  Danny's getting really...  Three times.  I see what's going on in the studio today.  Yeah?  Danny really just wants to punch David in the face.  Well, it doesn't end, though.  See, like, he's...  It's not like this is, like, a bit that, you know, once the show is over, like, the David  character goes away and the real David comes out.  No.  This is David.  This is him.  You know, you guys get to go home at 11 o'clock, and, you know, we all have to deal with him  until the afternoon, so...  Yeah.  And we walk in the elevator together.  Oh, that David.  Wow, that was fun today. 
[01:53:30]  And he's, you know, he's still...  He's just buffering everybody.  Doing the same thing and still repeating the punchlines of jokes, you know, over and over again.  It's the same guy.  This is not a bit.  This is the actual person of David.  This is him.  David, why are you depressed?  I'm not depressed at all.  I'm not.  You're kind of, like, sitting in the chair, your head's kind of sideways.  No, I'm just observing E-Rock at the moment.  Yeah?  I'm observing the fluff hat, yes.  Making sure he's doing a good job.  Why are you observing that?  It's funny. 
[01:54:00]  Why don't you say E-Rock's fluff hat into the mic over and over again, so you can let everybody  else know that it's really funny to you.  The other day, he's taking inventory over at a satellite at that.  Out of himself.  You know, I've been on, obviously, we've all been on, like, an office kick for, you know,  some time.  So I was like, David, what are you doing?  He tells me.  So I go, now, I'm going to need five reams of Dunder Mifflin paper.  Just as a dumb thing.  It wasn't even supposed to be funny.  But he goes, Dunder Mifflin, Dunder Mifflin, Dunder Mifflin.  Like, he had to say it, like, four times. 
[01:54:30]  You're looking at me like you want to punch me.  No.  It's good when he looks at someone, because for the most part, he doesn't look at anybody.  It doesn't matter, David.  Nothing's a matter, no.  Right?  I'm all right, sure.  This is a symptom.  I'm all right.  Who do you hate the most in the workplace right now?  It might change week to week, but right now, who do you hate the most at the workplace?  Who do I hate the most?  Yeah.  Be honest, David.  He's looking at Danny. 
[01:55:00]  He's staring at Danny.  Is it Danny?  I have to go with Danny right at the moment.  Why is that?  Why?  Why is that?  I don't know.  He's just making fun of me, I guess.  That's probably why.  You're very sensitive to the being made fun of, right?  Yeah.  Well, in that sort of nature, yeah.  On this radio show, that really is a good trait to have.  Yeah.  The thing is that...  Do you think he's mean-spirited?  No.  Okay.  Well, you know what it is?  I'll tell you what it is.  You're wrong.  He is.  Sam likes to manipulate, and he likes to get into the whole angle of everything, and that's 
[01:55:30]  where he gets his pleasure from.  I just don't have that same kind of patience.  So when David starts in with his garbage, I'm just very blunt and short with him.  Garbage.  He's calling what you do garbage.  Yes, he is.  I guess that's why you hate him the most.  Yeah.  Right now.  All right.  Hey, the economy sucks.  We're going to move on.  But the Snuggie.  Yeah.  We had a Snuggie in studio.  Jimmy tried it on.  It is horrendous. 
[01:56:00]  It was a hit.  But they're buying them like crazy.  Come on, admit it.  You've seen it, and you may have even thought about buying it.  And you know what?  You're not alone.  While retail sales of everything else seem to be going down, Snuggies, the blankets with  sleeves, are selling through the roof, with more than four million sold since September.  However, even finicky fashion-forward New Yorkers in the trendy meatpacking district are snuggling  up to the idea of the Snuggie.  Yeah, because the back is open.  You know the snuggly thing?  When I buy it?  Yeah, with the sleeves? 
[01:56:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  You have the economy, and you feel like it's a cozy thing, and you think, oh, it's cozy,  it's nice, it's a blanket.  It's horrendous.  It is horrendous.  It's not comfortable.  Because the back is open.  Yeah.  Right on.  I can't.  So you're prepared for some meatpacking.  Right.  It's sort of a pop culture item now, is what they're saying, but let's give it a little  time.  It's not quite the Chia Pet. 
[01:57:00]  They're building a cult with these Snuggies.  It's because everyone goofed on it.  It's not like, wow, this is great, let me get one.  It's because everyone goofed on the commercial, because everyone in the commercial looked like  an idiot wearing the thing.  Speaking of looking like an idiot.  Your hat is crying.  Just dripping.  You know what it looks like now?  It looks like Iraq was tossing dough in a pizzeria, and it fell and landed on his head.  Like an old I Love Lucy episode.  Iraq, we're losing you.  You barely can see at this point. 
[01:57:30]  Can you hear?  What?  What?  You can't really hear very well.  How are you going to get that out of your ears?  Your rear?  Well, this wasn't really well thought through.  I think if you go outside and let it harden a little bit, maybe.  Then you can just rip it right off your head.  Yeah.  Ouch.  That'd work.  Yeah.  Oh, David goes, ouch.  Ouch.  Like it might hurt.  And Danny just shakes his head in what can only be described as utter disgust.  Utter disgust. 
[01:58:00]  But Danny, you do know that, you know, that he's an ass.  Yeah, I get it.  During his interview, I let him say four words, and I was like, we have to take this guy.  But that doesn't mean I have to enjoy him as a person.  But you have to have a soft spot, because, you know.  I get it.  We're not stupid.  I get it, though.  You know.  Yeah.  I get it.  All right.  He's radio.  The old LD.  He's radio Goldberg.  You got to get it.  Radio Goldberg.  That's what he does.  That's what he does. 
[01:58:30]  Why is that funny, David?  This is a funny thing, because I'm a Jew.  It's funny.  You got to grade on a curve, if you know what I mean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm all for him on the show, but as individuals, I don't have to enjoy him.  All right.  You know, after the show ends, it's like Danny's still got to deal with him.  We lost D-Rock officially.  Oh, God.  It's over his mouth.  Imagine if he suffocated because of it.  It went over his mouth and nose.  It'll never make it to his chin if it's passed in his mouth. 
[01:59:00]  Live yourself.  Wow.  You can see all his facial features through the fluff, though.  It's kind of creepy.  That is weird.  It's creepy.  It's like a cat.  A hole is forming by his left eye, which is completely...  Because he keeps blinking.  You're like one of those tumor people now.  I'm a tree man.  Yeah.  Just like it.  Only white.  Oh, don't spit.  It's good.  You're spitting it at me.  He's making an eye hole.  I'm blinking a lot.  I'm getting an eye.  All right. 
[01:59:30]  Swallow it.  Finally, Andy.  Finally.  Finally.  We got some good news coming out of Iraq.  I think you're going to love this little story.  Yeah.  There's a statue that's honoring Bush.  That's good.  He liberated them, I guess.  We didn't want to, but okay.  Residents of Tikrit.  Tikrit, yeah.  The hometown of Saddam Hussein.  There's a picture of them laughing it up around a new statue honoring shoe thrower, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:00:00]  Ah, that guy.  They got a statue of a shoe.  Oh, they've built a shoe statue to honor the guy that threw his shoes at George Bush.  Yeah.  And they're having a good old time with that whole thing.  That's good.  You know, I wonder what would have happened if he honored a shoe had it been thrown at Saddam when he was there.  Oh, that's right.  He'd probably have his genitals taken off with a spade shovel. 
[02:00:30]  Whatever.  Just having a little fun with the shoe throwing incident.  That's all right.  You know something?  Have a field day, Iraqis.  I know they listen, by the way.  Have a field day there, Iraqis, when the troops do leave.  Yeah.  Just have fun trying to defend yourself against the influx of just extremists and civil war that will be going on there.  It's going to be fun to watch all of you getting killed, pretty much, because, you know, the shoe statue, it'll be a fond little memory. 
[02:01:00]  While some people that don't like you, that believe in the same thing, only slightly different, come into your house and kill your whole family.  There you go.  Which should have been happening in the first place, to tell you the truth, because we shouldn't have been there to liberate those people.  I agree.  But, yeah, whatever.  Have fun.  It's really going to be fun news out of Iraq when the troops do leave. 
[02:01:30]  Ew, get away from me, sticky man.  In a woman's...  In this Wonder Woman outfit.  In a Wonder Woman outfit.  You're just tuning in.  You missed a lot today.  We're going to do a little mopping up next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Yeah, we're wrapping up.  We had a real good week of fun.  Yes.  Iraq can't see right now.  That looks so cool.  It's moldy.  I want to slap it on his face.  Now he's like... 
[02:02:00]  He's getting kind of that Leonidas helmet thing going.  It's a fluff Roman war helmet.  Do you hear Iraq?  He doesn't even know where to look.  Are you having a problem with that thing right there, or what?  A little bit.  Is it like kind of happening?  What?  Is it...  The things.  Uh-huh.  Oh, you're screwing with me.  No. 
[02:02:30]  The things.  That was excellent improv.  Let's get out of here.  You've got the Super Bowl Sunday.  You've got Jimmy's tickets going on sale in a couple minutes here for the Tower Theater in Philly.  Yes, at 9 a.m.  LiveNation.com.  It goes on sale in about two minutes.  Those tickets are going to sell very fast.  Ed, doing anything fun over the weekend?  I'm just hanging out, man.  I've got no plans, man.  I'm just going to, yeah, do nothing. 
[02:03:00]  I'm looking for a cool place to see the Super Bowl.  Call of Duty.  Yeah.  Probably play some Call of Duty.  Yeah.  Play some movies.  Yeah.  Play some beers.  Yeah.  I don't care about the Super Bowl, like I said, so, yeah.  You'll take a little peek, though.  You'll see me on Pal Talk, probably.  Okay.  I like my virtual friends.  They're easy.  They're easy to deal with.  I could just hit, like, the button, and they're gone.  I don't have to say goodbye.  I don't have to do anything.  It's great.  It is kind of nice.  All right.  Music marathon time.  What do we got? 
[02:03:30]  What are we starting off with?  Today?  Yeah.  Is that the Leonidas helmet?  Yes, it is.  That is.  Yeah, it was looking like that.  How do you even know that?  Ah, because I've watched that movie 8,000 times.  I understand.  It's one of my favorites.  I just know it as the helmet from that movie.  From 300 pounds.  This is delicious.  What are you doing, Rocky?  You're like, why are you near me?  You're scaring me. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  All right.  What's the first song?  I get sticky.  First up is Whole Lotta Love by Led Zeppelin.  Whole Lotta Love by Zeppelin.  You know that one, right?  Because you've got to do the Led Lunch thing.  You ever hear that one?  It's pretty good.  Yeah, I'm thinking what Zeppelin song I want to hear instead.  That's a rather popular number.  Let's do it a little, uh, hmm.  Hmm.  Tangerine's good.  What do you want to hear, Ant?  What Zeppelin song would you want to hear?  Zeppelin?  You're not a Zeppelin fan. 
[02:04:30]  Although, I mean, you're...  Dancin' dance.  But you hear that one a lot, too, though.  Yeah.  Y-Rock, what are you doing?  And if I say to you tomorrow...  That kind of a little too slow.  Huh?  I believe he's trying to pull off the fluff with the cape.  Oh, good luck.  I thought you were walking XM like that.  No, we're going to do...  No.  You're not walking XM like that.  Telly Saval ass. 
[02:05:00]  No, no, no.  All right, play the song, I guess.  Ah!  I guess.  Wow.  I can't picture...  I can't sit around and listen to our song today.  How disgusting this is going to be.  What is he?  He's trying to pull it off.  He's trying to get it off.  No.  And it's hurting so bad.  Dude, you should have to do this at XM.  This is silly.  Dude.  Dude, it's not coming off that way.  You need really hot water and hope it melts off.  Hurry up.  Just run a comb through.  You'll be fine.  Run a comb?  Yeah, that'll work.  Come on.  Style.  What is he trying to do? 
[02:05:30]  Is any coming out?  The access is coming off.  Now, very...  That is caked in there.  I think he's...  Oh, it's...  Oh.  Is that uncomfortable, E-Rock?  Peel it off.  Peel off the...  No, you've got to walk the streets.  Shut up, David.  E-Rock, you're not happy with David?  No, he's an asshole.  No.  Oh.  He may be, but he's not a potty mouth, is he?  Yeah, he won't be on the dump sheet today. 
[02:06:00]  You look like Divine.  How long is it my time of dying?  Pat from Minocchi wants to hear that one.  That's a good one, man.  That might be too long, though.  Yeah, that is way...  I know, it's a long song.  Sorry, Pat.  How about some Carouselombra?  That's kind of a cool song, but...  And you know what?  We don't even...  Oh, in the evening.  In the evening, as long as the one  they're going to play?  Hang on, I'll tell you right now.  Hang on.  What are you doing, E-Rock?  You can't get the Wonder Woman headband off his head.  Good.  Of course, big fat head. 
[02:06:30]  Nah, in the evening, it's a little long.  I love that sound.  All right, they're going to...  They're going to play their Zeppelin song.  We've got to go.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Have a great weekend if you're not joining us  over at SiriusXM.  That was delicious, though.  Well, what do you call that snack?  It's a failure.  We'll see you guys Monday.  All right, Opie and Anthony continuing 
[02:07:00]  with the program.  For the newbies out there,  you're going to now hear  a little more cursing  because we're allowed to do that now.  Yeah.  It makes it so much better.  Yeah.  Where's intern David?  Where's...  Hey, David!  And I hear the moans out there.  Don't worry.  This is a quickie.  David, we've got a very big crowd today.  A nice-sized crowd.  Yeah, really, though.  The crowds were down this week. 
[02:07:30]  We had a few listeners here,  a few listeners there,  but the Friday show  gets a lot of listeners  to come by and check it out, David.  Oh, it certainly does.  And we want you...  This is your new job as executive intern.  When you're here  and you see a crowd,  I want you to work the crowd  behind the scenes  to see if they have anything  that we can bring  to the radio show.  Okay?  Okay, sounds good.  So you go out there  and you kind of work the crowd  a little bit  and go,  Hey, hi, I'm intern David.  I'm the executive intern 
[02:08:00]  of the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay.  Make sure you say that.  And then you see  if they have anything  they can bring to the show.  Okay.  All right?  Sounds good to me.  All right, go.  Okay.  Thank God it sounds good to him.  Yeah.  Have fun, Dave.  What an ass he is, man.  Wow, how does someone  get 133,000 points  on Brick Breaker?  Is that a high  or a good score?  That's a good score  and your name is  really fucked up  from Boston  so I can't even  give you credit.  Stinny...  Stinny K. Durson? 
[02:08:30]  Skinny Anderson?  Something?  Skinny Anderson?  I don't know.  One thing you know  it's not a skinny Nagel.  The guy's got  20 lives left.  God damn,  is that good.  Sam,  what is he doing?  Well,  he's just starting  to interview people  and just find out.  He said,  wow,  one person  is from New Orleans.  Okay.  Oh,  that's the first fun fact.  This is Travis  from New Orleans  that we're meeting.  Okay.  That gets a wow  from him?  Yes.  All right,  so David's going 
[02:09:00]  to work the audience  and then we'll find out  in about 15 minutes  what he has come up with.  Well,  15 minutes per person  knowing David.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no, no, no.  Jesus Christ.  I want to report back  to David in 15 minutes, Sam.  15 minutes.  So you can supervise David  as he works the crowd.  We're going to turn  the audience mic off  a little while  so David can do his magic  as executive intern.  David.  All right.  Hey,  we were talking about  the snakehead fish.  Yeah.  We got some audio.  The invasion of the snakeheads.  That's the one that stands up? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  By the way,  you're lying about them  marching toward Macy's.  Oh, my God.  Would they not?  Why would they not?  Oh, that was the Japanese fish.  Those are the ones that...  They're called snakeheads.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we found the official name.  Sizzling on the hot pavement.  Yeah.  Yeah,  but these things  are just a nuisance  and a danger.  And the National Geographic  did a whole thing  on the snakehead fish.  Didn't I?  And we got a couple  quick clips to go through.  Frightened.  Are you frightened?  Very frightened.  I've never seen one.  They've never affected my life. 
[02:10:00]  So I don't give a fuck about them.  What are the snakes  that will raise up  in prayer?  Praise his name.  Why are you still listening?  Oh, no, no.  Christian Jimmy.  Oh, Christian Jimmy.  That's all I got.  One line.  All right.  Well, uh...  Hold on.  Who was that...  Who was fucking  Quickfinger Madraw?  Madraw?  Oh, yeah.  Did I say Madraw?  Exactly,  because Madraw wouldn't do it.  Only Madraw would.  Madraw.  I think I'm a draw. 
[02:10:30]  I got...  I got an answer  to my question.  Tim H. from Columbus.  One gets $133,000  on Brick Breaker  by never having sex.  Ah, it sucks.  I got the answer  to my question.  Uh...  So we...  I don't know.  Stump Brain's  not around anymore.  Maybe we could get him  on the phone,  but some dumb snake  that's eating everything,  eating all the birds  in Guam or something.  Maybe a listener  can help us out with that.  But this is  Invasion of the Snakeheads.  It's very scary,  these fishies. 
[02:11:00]  There's a new invader  on the block.  Mm-hmm.  A ferocious fish  with a massive appetite  and razor-sharp teeth.  It may even  walk on land.  The Snakehead.  It represents  an introduction  of something  that can compete  and possibly  out-compete  the native fishes.  And like I said,  I've never seen one.  Yeah, but eventually  this is going to affect you.  Don't you understand?  It's a delicate ecosystem 
[02:11:30]  out there.  It's like,  no, it isn't.  For some reason,  I think people think  of the ecosystem  as a lot more delicate  than it is.  I'm not worried  about the Snakehead fish.  I'm with you.  But the honeybees.  There's something going on  with the bees  and then eventually  it's not going to be good  for us.  As humans.  In the summer,  there's bees everywhere.  Right.  But according to the experts,  not as many bees  as there used to be.  Yes, then there's  a reason for that.  And we need them  for our food supply.  We don't.  Yes, we do.  I go to the supermarket  and I see food everywhere. 
[02:12:00]  But eventually,  it's amazing.  You're not going to see  as much food.  The food I see everywhere.  And then there's going to be  zombies on the street  because now...  Oh, don't even tempt me.  I would adore  a zombie invasion.  Yeah, you'd be the...  Oh, would that be...  Come to my house, motherfucker?  You would be the leader  that we would all follow.  Oh, would that be fun?  What would...  I would do something original.  I would go to the mall.  Yeah.  No?  No.  There's only zombies  in there.  Oh, of course.  That's where they all go.  What's your game plan  for a zombie invasion, though? 
[02:12:30]  Beat them or burn them.  Shoot them in the head.  And then?  Yeah, I would...  A zombie invasion?  Mm-hmm.  I'd hold up in my house.  Of course, you've got to  batten down the hatches,  do a lot of work  keeping the doors  secure downstairs.  Get everyone upstairs.  I saw...  I imagined, too.  Your last-ditch effort.  Yeah.  And then get enough people  over your house  where they can cover  with interlocking fields of fire  to cover the entire premises.  And then you just pick them off  as they come.  Hope they enjoy 
[02:13:00]  Jewish dishes for dinner.  It's in my neighborhood.  So hopefully, you know,  they build up a taste  for Hebrew people.  Before you?  And, yeah.  They don't want  the Catholic on the block.  Yeah, zombie invasion  would be a dream come true  for me.  Hold on a minute.  We've got Josh in Philly.  Josh?  Yeah, morning, boys.  Good morning, Josh.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir, so much.  I got the name  of that fish for you.  The one that eats everything.  It's the E-Rock fish. 
[02:13:30]  Ah, poor E-Rock.  He hasn't done enough  for this show today.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Nate in Vegas.  Nate?  Yeah, if Dave is the  executive intern,  can I be the executive listener?  Do you want an executive  listener today, Ant?  That's really your decision.  You know something?  It's probably as useful a title  as executive intern.  I'm looking for a job,  so I already put it on my resume.  Oh, you did? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, okay.  If you put it on your resume,  then let's give him  the executive listener position.  Sam, you got a mic?  Yeah.  Hold on there, Nate.  We got Nate on the phone, Sam.  He wants to be  executive listener.  Oh, that's something  I'd have to clear with David.  So where is David?  As executive intern,  I want to see  if there's something here.  Where's David?  Right here.  David, there's Nate from Vegas.  He's on the phone,  and he wants to be  executive listener.  Is that a good idea? 
[02:14:30]  What would he do  as executive listener?  That's why we're asking you  as executive intern.  What would an executive  listener do?  I don't know about  that executive listener.  Huh?  I don't know about  that executive listener.  He said he'd do  about as much as you do,  which is nothing,  so it's just the title.  Whoa.  Whoa.  What the fuck was that noise?  I don't think so.  I don't like this guy.  Well, no,  you can't judge it  on not liking somebody.  That's discrimination. 
[02:15:00]  You've got to look  at his qualifications.  Sir, how long  have you been listening?  Mm-hmm.  I started listening  to you guys in Vegas  when you were here  on Terrestrial Radio,  and then I bought XM  just to keep you guys  going.  All right.  He's qualified  for the job as a listener.  He's been listening  a while, David.  What do you want him  to do as an executive  listener?  Give him some chores.  Well, as an executive  listener, he'd have to...  If he was...  Oh, my God.  He had to stop  talking as somebody 
[02:15:30]  put headphones on him.  He completely  stopped talking,  waited for the headphones  to be put on him,  and then continued  talking.  He couldn't talk  as the headphones  were being put on.  Because he doesn't  like to be touched.  I told you guys  that already.  So that was something  touching him,  which freaks him out.  But now he's okay  because it's not  a touching thing anymore.  David?  Yes?  Give this guy  some chores.  If he was an executive  listener, then he'd have  to prove that he was  listening every day  by calling in  every single day.  No.  Could you do that, sir? 
[02:16:00]  Absolutely.  All right.  You have to call every day.  That's your first job  as an executive listener.  Every single day  has to call over here  at the XM side  every single day.  Now, David,  there's Derek  in New York City  who wants to be  the senior  executive listener.  Oh, wow.  Oh, does he have  more years of listening  experience than  this other Vegas guy?  Well, that's a  very good question.  Nate, how many years...  And don't lie  because we'll...  Don't lie or I'll none.  No. 
[02:16:30]  Two and a half.  Two and a half years.  All right, hold on a minute.  We got...  We got Derek  from New York City.  Derek, how long  have you been listening  to the program?  BAB.  BAB years?  Wow.  Are you just lying?  No.  Prove that you've been  listening since the BAB years.  Uh-oh.  Please don't do it.  Do it.  What?  I'm sorry?  Prove that you've been  listening since the BAB years.  Oh, God.  We have to go  with the braw bombs.  No, that was... 
[02:17:00]  That was AF.  Oh, that was...  That was a tell, my friend.  Man, ever since you  started with XM,  that's when I started listening.  Oh, you lying sack of shit.  Boo.  All right, he can't be  a senior executive listener.  Okay, so I guess  Las Vegas wins.  Sorry.  All right.  So far, Nate,  your first job  is to call every day  as executive listener,  and then David  will give you more chores  after that, I guess.  He starts them off easy,  I guess.  Yeah.  You call in every single day,  and why don't you call in  every single day?  You have to comment  on one specific story  that O&A are talking about 
[02:17:30]  to prove that  you really are listening.  All right.  How come you don't  have to do anything  to prove that  you're doing anything  as executive intern?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Sam had to hit him  to get him to talk.  I know.  He'll just ponder  a question,  even though it's radio.  Well, Sam's his handler.  Yeah, he really is.  All right.  Get back to working  the crowd there, Dave.  We're going to check in  with you in about 10 minutes.  Can I ask you  a question, though, Dave?  Yeah.  Yes, Gene.  I think in response 
[02:18:00]  to Opie's question  was an answer question  about what do you have to do  to prove what you do.  I think that basically  the proof's in the pudding,  as we say,  is what your on-air performance.  Okay.  Way to sell it.  Sam is a handler.  How old do you have  to let a Jew get  before you can set him  on his own  as a handler?  Born Friedman.  Did you just set up  your own brilliant line?  I did.  I set it up myself. 
[02:18:30]  I just want to acknowledge that.  I'll set my own table  and then eat.  You knew you had  a really good line,  but you just needed  someone to get you there.  He's the Abbott  and the Costello.  Holy shit.  We can't let that one slide.  I know.  I'm a greedy bastard.  Not to say  it wasn't a good line,  but maybe you could have,  like, I don't know,  written a little note  and said,  can someone help me here?  Help me out here.  I'm trying to do  a two-joke, Henry.  Henry.  You're a boy.  I'm trying to see  his attire  in this day and age.  All right, David,  go back to work  in the crowd.  We'll go on to  Chris in Pennsylvania. 
[02:19:00]  Charisma he's got.  Yeah, Chris.  Hey, guys.  I saw something yesterday  that I think you'd appreciate.  I was driving around  and I saw a half-shoveled property  at a house  with a snow shovel  slightly askew  propped up on the snow.  And then on the other side  of the house  there was an ambulance  loading someone into it.  And then I couldn't stop  to laugh about that.  And then this morning  I read the paper.  He died of a heart attack.  Jesus.  What the hell?  What do you think?  Oh, sir.  The other day  you were talking about  what has been ruined  by you guys in our lives 
[02:19:30]  and for some reason  I feel no compassion  and just find stuff like that.  He's compassionless  because of this show.  All right.  Well, as long as  we've done something.  What kind of people  do you think we are?  Compassionless idiots.  Executive producer  or an executive listener also  because I even got  the Blackberry to listen  to you guys  when I'm doing calls  fixing copiers.  Yeah.  Do you think  you finish the rest  of the job  or you just let it sit there?  Leave it.  Why bother?  Well, if the guy dies  and you're doing his job,  he died shoveling  his own driveway  it looks like.  Just leave it.  That happens to a lot of people. 
[02:20:00]  Why shovel?  Just plow right through  with your vehicle.  Get in your car  and just drive  shoveling.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  That was a fun little story  for Friday.  All right.  Back to the snakehead fish.  Pepper is scary.  Yeah.  A northern snakehead  reaches sexual maturity  by age two or three.  Yeah.  Each spawning  each animal can be leased.  They're like people.  Oh, no, they're not,  Uncle Paul.  That's terrible.  They're two different things,  Paul.  It's not different. 
[02:20:30]  Amber understands.  Oh, no, she doesn't.  She never understood.  She doesn't like  your snakefish either.  Who is that girl?  I see her name.  Amber Alli.  She's really cute,  I bet.  No, I believe  that's Amber Alert.  See, you're...  Oh.  I also believe  that's an awful joke.  Hard to wordplay  on this  with alert.  I should executive  produce this show.  I ruined things. 
[02:21:00]  I ruined things.  Someone is throwing  the name out.  Doug Yole.  Wow.  Okay.  Now that's somebody  that knows.  That guy should be  senior executive  listener.  Doug Yole was  probably my first  intern in radio  and he's now  a successful musician.  I was just looking  him up the other day.  Yeah.  He's doing very well  in Woodstock, New York  doing his music. 
[02:21:30]  Woodstock.  But he started  on the BAB show.  So that guy  becomes  executive,  senior executive  listener.  The Zagman, actually.  Your assistant  to the assistant  senior executive  listener.  That was a good  call right there.  Back to the  snakehead fish.  A northern snakehead  reaches sexual  maturity by age  two or three.  Each spawning  age female  can release  up to 15,000  eggs at once.  Hot.  Snakeheads can  mate as often  as five times  in the stomach. 
[02:22:00]  You have to  make a machine  that's just like  a fucking  robot thing  with a shoe  on it.  He's booting  her in the  old belly.  That's a lot  of kicks  in his stomach.  You have to  get a bunch  of MMA guys  and do it  in shifts.  All right.  All right. 
[02:22:30]  Snakeheads can  mate as often  as five times  a year.  This means  in just two  years.  As often  as five times  a year.  What are they  married couples?  That's horrible.  It's not too  often at all.  This announcer  is really jaded.  Do you believe  how lucky they  are?  They get to  fuck five  times a year.  Five times  a year.  As opposed to  cicadas, I guess  that's great.  What is that  every 20 years?  Cicada dumps  one load and  then 17 years  later he crawls  out of the dirt.  That's got to  suck. 
[02:23:00]  Or the dumb  panda.  Pandas never  fuck.  They don't,  right?  What?  The male just  jerks off in  the female's ear  and laughs with  his friends.  A lot of people,  scientists didn't know  that for a long  time, but the  male panda is a  jerk off freak  and he enjoys  humiliating the  female by coming  on her face and  ears.  The panda, it's a  disaster, right?  Yeah, it is.  Or it's doing a lot.  It's very hard in  captivity to make  them mate.  Make them have a  baby.  Are they having  sex though?  I think you've got  to jerk them off 
[02:23:30]  into a petri dish  and have her squat  in it or some shit.  What happens is a  lot of times the  female will come in  while the panda is  eating like a  cantaloupe and a  banana.  And she'll just  suck the panda's  dick and then  fucking, she'll  take it and then  while the female is  sleeping, you open  those little fat  panda legs and you  just go, and you  spit it in.  And you wish for  the best.  Fat panda legs,  huh?  You grab those  little fat panda  legs.  Or chubby.  And you'll hold  her up on her  back and you  shake the semen  down into her. 
[02:24:00]  Old panda cum.  It tastes like  Sanka.  Let's go to Chris  in Canada.  Chris.  And a Chris.  Chris.  Yeah, I'm phoning  in to apply for the  position of senior  executive international  listener.  Oh.  You know what?  We have listeners all  over the world, so  Canada is sort of  America.  I would say...  We need someone from  far away.  We've had calls from 
[02:24:30]  Jerusalem, Japan...  And I don't like the  title.  I like executive...  Senior executive  listener...  International Bureau.  Ah, nice.  Yeah.  I don't think we  could give it to a  Canadian.  No.  I really don't.  I'm really sorry.  No.  Mary in Jerusalem.  Mary.  Hi, I would like to  be executive secretary  to the executive...  to the executive...  intern.  It's a Monty Python  bit.  Yeah, exactly.  Right, right. 
[02:25:00]  You want to have  babies?  All right, well, we'll  get an international  listener.  What is the title?  International Rep.  We need a...  Yeah, we need an  executive listener,  international bureau,  or international desk.  Yeah.  All right.  Surprised I see so  many guys out there,  not a lot of girls.  Yeah.  It is a surprise.  It's usually so many  hot chicks come in  and sit on those  bleachers, yeah.  Just amazing how  many we get usually.  Those bleachers just  get pushed back at  the end of the day,  smell like musky ass.  I was just thinking  of that.  They smell like  asshole and onions. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking awful.  French onion soup.  That's what a fucking  bleachers smell like.  But just sweaty,  nervous guys,  puckering assholes,  hoping to fucking  bang the one chick  in the stands.  How about we do  this, ladies night,  or ladies day?  Ladies day on Friday?  Next Friday is  ladies day.  All right, you can  just put the bleachers  away.  Exactly.  No, how about we do  this?  You're not even allowed  in unless you bring a  lady, kind of like the  bar scenario.  Oh, okay.  So the guys bring the  lady. 
[02:26:00]  Well, that's bad because  then this guy's with  the ladies.  That's down on the  possibilities.  We've got to bring a  sister or a mother or  an aunt.  Aunt.  No wives or  girlfriends.  We'll have the guys  filling out so much  paperwork it won't even  matter.  Little sisters.  Bring your little  sister.  Bring your kid sis.  Ladies day next  Friday where we don't  let you in.  Braces.  Got to have braces.  I don't care.  Teeth or legs.  Doesn't matter.  Prefrontal of both.  Yeah.  So you can fucking  put a magnet on your 
[02:26:30]  ankle and hook your  teeth to it and fuck  you while you're bent  over.  It's the best part.  Back to the snake  heads.  We've got four more  clips to go here.  What?  Five times a year.  This means in just two  years a single female  can release up to  150,000 eggs.  In a natural habitat  where predators and  prey work in balance,  vast breedings kept in  check.  But in a foreign  ecosystem where  natural predators are  missing, it can lead to 
[02:27:00]  a disastrous population  explosion.  Oh.  And that's where the  problem is, Nancy.  Yeah.  That's what's going to  affect you eventually.  Wow.  No predator.  What?  Spinner shark.  Look at this thing.  Oh, look.  It's spinning in a circle.  Those are the gay sharks.  The gay sharks.  They just come out of  the water, they spin in  a circle, and they go  back down.  It really is just flying  out of the water, spinning  around.  Why is it spinning?  They do that occasionally.  They don't know why.  Because they're not happy.  They breach.  Sharks do this breaching 
[02:27:30]  thing like whales do, but  they're not supposed to.  It's to probably shake  whatever's on there off.  Oh, that's good.  Or those pilot fish that  they get on them.  Yeah, they have pilot  fish and things.  Little leeches.  Probably want to shake  those things off so they  can come right back on in  three seconds as soon as  they hit the water.  Dumb sharks.  It's probably pollution  that we, you know.  Oh, they got to get that  off of them.  I think it's to show  how badass he is, and  don't fucking come in the  water, I'll bite you.  Yeah.  They're very, very  dangerous.  Good point.  Snakeheads are also 
[02:28:00]  known to lash out at any  who approach them.  Of the 29 known snakehead  varieties, many, like the  giant snakehead, are  powerful hunters with  ravenous appetites and  sharp, snapping jaws.  Jaws that can tear  flesh.  Even human flesh.  They're exaggerating.  At first, I wasn't quite  sure with thinning.  So I put a wedding  dress on and it's  stuck my dick in his  mouth.  And I shit on its fins and  blocked out its pubic 
[02:28:30]  hair.  What?  What kind of language is  he speaking?  Some Japanese, I believe.  Was it?  Ah, who could tell?  Even human flesh.  We pixelate the pubes  first away from the  fish.  I saw a lot of blood on  my arm.  I thought I was lucky  it didn't hurt me that  much.  They can bite your entire  hand off.  Then my wife, Heather, had  the same thing happen to  her.  She tried to put her  tootsie in the fish's  mouth. 
[02:29:00]  Fucking idiot, probably  wrapped it in seaweed and  rice and ate it.  Dummy.  Hey, Dan, how big is it?  Can we Google these fish  and see how big they  are?  Google.  Yeah, they're nasty  looking.  They really are, but are  they piranha-sized?  I like the way they go  flesh.  Even human flesh.  Even human.  Like, we'd go, what?  Really?  We thought it was other  creatures, not us.  Yeah.  Our flesh is, we get  paper cuts.  It hurts.  Should we continue with  this?  Yes.  Snake heads lashing out,  giant snake heads, jaws,  I could tear flesh.  We did that one. 
[02:29:30]  You know what?  I can tell by this.  They're over-exaggerating.  Just because of the music?  Something hunts and tears  like flesh off of a fucking  frog or some shit.  Right.  And it's like, even human  flesh.  And they talk to some guy  like a bit and he's  bleeding on his arm.  Like Jimmy said, you know,  we get fucking a little  nothing and we're bleeding.  They're saying they could  devastate a food chain,  though.  Yeah.  By fucking shit up.  Eating the bees.  Snake head attacks are just  a small part of their  danger.  To an ecosystem, invading  snake heads pose a far 
[02:30:00]  greater threat.  Do they?  Outside its natural habitat,  the northern variety can  decimate a food chain.  These fish are top level  predators.  I don't eat chains.  That will eat virtually  anything in their path.  They can travel across  land and live out of water  for up to three days.  Drive cars.  Yes.  They have one of those  where there's 3,000 of them  piled in.  They make it sound like  these things are such a  fucking threat.  Exactly.  They're a member of the  Delta Sky team and they  trade frequent flyer miles. 
[02:30:30]  Never seen one.  Out of water for up to  three days.  On land, snake heads use  a primitive lung above  their gills.  They have these air  cheevers just up underneath  the water.  Mutants!  Water world.  That air is  going up into those  air cheevers.  In many respects,  like a lung.  All right.  We're not.  Wow.  They could breathe in  out of the water.  That's the most amazing  thing.  Fuck the teeth.  Fuck the thing.  Fuck everything.  They can breathe out of  the water and in the  water.  For how long, though,  can they breathe out of  the water? 
[02:31:00]  Do they say?  Come on!  25 years.  They're on the board of  many condos in New York  City.  Thank you, Kenny.  25 years.  This guy, John, had a  snakehead.  That's long.  Seven years ago, he had a  snakehead fish.  So let's get some answers.  What happened?  John.  You still got the  motherfucker?  Why did you eat it?  Like a sandfish.  Oh, John talking, Jimmy.  Sorry.  We're getting them all  today.  Shut up, he tells you.  All right.  What's your name?  John.  My name is John from  Whitehouse State.  Hey, John. 
[02:31:30]  I owned one of these  snakeheads seven years  ago.  They're not overestimating  them.  I bought it.  It was three inches long.  In 15 months, it grew to be  42 inches.  I mean, if you put your  finger in, you were losing  your finger.  What did you put it in at  42 inches long?  His pants.  And then it walked away.  Went and got a job at  Bradley's.  He was the floor manager  at Bradley's.  Stupid Bradley's.  I had him in a 150-gallon  fish tank.  He outgrew the tank.  I mean, he was just this  monster fishing area. 
[02:32:00]  You get up for work.  He's taking a shit on the  ball, reading the paper.  He's hanging over the edge.  The guy who stands outside  the fucking little castle  has been hung.  You plow right ahead  with the facts.  A hundred old fish would  be gone in a minute or  less.  Why would you put other  fish in there?  Exactly.  Of course, it's called  food to him.  You gotta eat.  How big?  42 inches, dude.  That's three feet.  Yeah, over three feet.  Three and a half.  In a 150-gallon tank?  Come on.  You're bullshitting me. 
[02:32:30]  No, they're a 150-gallon  tank.  It's six foot long,  two feet high,  and 24 inches wide.  Two feet wide and  24 inches high.  That's a big difference.  So it's two feet high  and two feet wide.  It's a box.  You're a dummy.  He threw them in a UPS  box and made it glass.  No, man, we used to  feed them around.  We'd feed them mice,  rats, huge frogs.  Mice?  I'm surprised the mouse  didn't drink the water  when you threw it in.  How many fucking days?  Anyway, I ended up... 
[02:33:00]  He's a cloud right  through this jar.  Anyway.  He doesn't care.  What's that, sir?  Every time you bought  another fish, he would  kill it instantly, even  though, I mean, piranhas  are...  They're little faggot  fish.  I mean, he would even  look like a shrimp tail  floating around in a tank  when it got done with it.  Well, sir, piranhas are  much smaller.  I mean, I imagine...  If you threw...  He does not care what  you have to say, Jimmy.  Yes.  Hey, brief pause only,  guy.  How many piranhas would  you put in there at a  time?  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  We need to know.  I had piranhas at the  store, and they were so  boring.  You had to hide behind a  cast room to eat, so I  got rid of them.  But how many would you  put in...  How many would you put  in...  And I mean, in metric  tons, how many?  No, I...  With piranhas, I had  like a dozen of them,  but they were so  boring.  How big is a piranha?  Piranhas would be about  the size of...  Like a pancake, a  little smaller.  That's pretty fucking  big.  Silver dollar pancake.  I like the Jack Dempsey's.  I used to feed him  spiders, and they  would eat them, and  the legs would, like, 
[02:34:00]  wrap around a face  like alien.  Oh, really?  That was great.  Great restaurant to  get picked up in front  of a store.  Yes, Jack Dempsey's.  This is plow through  every fucking word,  guy.  Hold on.  Hey, fuck it.  The Germans were  more...  were gentler when  cleaning out the  Warsaw ghetto than  you are in this  conversation.  Jesus.  That's where I  went wrong.  You don't get what's  going on here.  This guy's been  waiting years to be  needed on this show.  Yeah.  And this is the day.  This is his  opportunity.  Yeah, so you're  trying to get a lot  of years of knowledge  into a 30-second  conversation.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  Knowledge no one  gives a shit about.  Yeah, we just want  to know if we're  going to be able to  survive with these  dumb snakehead fish  that are marching  around.  And what'd you do  with it?  Flush it down the  toilet?  It's in the  sewers now.  I ended up,  I put him in a  hundred quart cooler.  He was in there  for six months  with an air bubble  thing going.  That's it.  And I'd feed him  once in a while  and then a buddy  of mine took him  and put him in  his tank with  his African  cichlid.  And that time I  saw him, he only  had a snakehead  living in there.  So the snakehead  adapts to land. 
[02:35:00]  How far can  they go on land?  I don't know  how far they can  go on land,  but he lived in a  cooler that I  never changed the  water.  I only added water  in a cooler.  All right, we  got it.  We understand.  In a cooler.  So you're saying  cooler like it's  fishnet stockings.  If he lived six  months in a pair  of fishnet stockings  or a hairnet,  I'd be shocked.  Yeah, it's cooler  with water in it.  Wow, a fish  lived in water?  In a cooler.  Preposterous.  Which is meant  to keep liquids in.  You don't say.  You're living in a  closet, you can't 
[02:35:30]  even turn around.  Yeah, I got it,  sir, but you're  saying like it's  a fucking...  Now you're  talking about Steve.  Hey, did you say  that your friend  put them in with  African chicklids?  Yeah, they have.  Isn't this a  freshwater fish and  chicklids a saltwater  fish?  Oh!  Chicklids are  freshwater fish.  Go do your  research.  I think I will  because I think  you're wrong.  I think Danny did  his research.  Yeah, he's doing  it with the...  Why did he throw  that fish in with  delicious gum?  I wish I could  hate him.  P-U.  Why?  I love a good  razz joke. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, I'm sorry,  chicklids.  Remember razz gum  was multicolored  and sugary?  Yeah.  I just remember  razzles.  Is it a gum or  is it a candy?  We don't fucking  know.  That's right.  What was it?  It was a weapon.  I would fucking  hard them in the  freezer and throw  them at the eyes  of retarded  children.  Come on,  fucking take it  on my feet here.  Not doing well.  Alright, you get  all your knowledge  out because we  got to move on  there, John.  Yeah, that's  about it.  Enough about  your snakefish.  Right.  Thanks, John.  Alright, you know 
[02:36:30]  what?  This snakehead fish  thing isn't going  anywhere.  Let's move on.  I think it's  pretty cool, though.  Screw the rest  of the clips.  Three and a half  fucking feet long?  Dude, that's a  fucking massive fish.  And they walk  on land and they  adapt.  Yes.  They're like  slinkies.  Alright.  I'm going to  start a show  called The Snakefish  Whisperer.  I train wayward  snakefishes.  My snakefish  eats everything  I put in the tank.  I don't know  what to do.  Oh, Ted.  That's right.  I'm Ted the  snakefish owner.  I don't know  what to do. 
[02:37:00]  He's fucked my  wife, too,  when I'm away  at work.  You're a cuckold  for a snakefish.  He uses my  slippers as his  own.  When he walks  around your house.  Yeah, that's how  you know when your  newspaper's damp and  your slippers are  outside the fish tank.  I know what he's  been up to.  I'm not stupid,  right?  Yeah.  Your fucking  refrigerator door  handle is smelly  and slippery.  It smells like  fish.  And all your  fish food's gone.  That'd be an  indicator.  We're going to  take a break because  we've got to find 
[02:37:30]  out what intern  David came up  with.  Oh, yeah.  He's been  working in the  audience.  What he's called  from the audience.  Yeah, big audience  on the bleachers.  I don't know if  the mic's on.  Oh, it's inside  here.  That's the problem.  That's why we're  not getting a crowd  reaction.  Yeah, we did tell  him to put it in.  Okay, no worries.  So we'll find out  if David got  anything for the  show by using  the listeners.  He just worked  them for a while.  Stay there.  I got it.  We'll be in  Anthony.  Big crowd  outside.  I think their  mic's on finally. 
[02:38:00]  We're going to  check in with  intern David to  see if any of  those guys have  anything for the  radio show today.  But first,  calling from L.A.,  I do believe,  Bill Burr.  Bill!  What's up, man?  Hi, Bill Burr.  I was very happy  to look over to my  right on the  phones and see  that you were  sitting there  waiting to talk  to us.  Yeah, you know  what?  Yeah, I'm sitting  out here in my  hybrid, out in  Los Angeles.  Yeah, that hybrid.  And you thought  of Anthony?  No, you know  what's been bugging  me?  You know, I  trashed the 
[02:38:30]  ShamWow back  in the day.  I actually had  to give not  100% detraction,  but I wasn't  quite using the  product correctly.  Oh, wait a  minute.  Now, what  happened?  Because I  always, anytime  anyone crows  about the  ShamWow, which  by the way, in  popular mechanics,  they did a whole  thing on 10  seen-on-TV  products, and  the ShamWow  got a huge,  stunning review.  I read that  very same article,  and I was very  surprised to see the  ShamWow getting 
[02:39:00]  decent reviews.  And all I've  been saying, one  moment, Mr.  Burr, all I've  been saying is,  well, Bill Burr  got it, and he  said the plastic it  came in was more  absorbent than the  ShamWow, I believe  was your quote.  So what has  happened to change  your tune?  I was walking  through a mall, and  I'm seeing this guy  demonstrating the  ShamWow to all  these idiots, and  he's got the  little Janet  Jackson headset on, 
[02:39:30]  just like the  guy in the  commercial, and I  was just like,  you've got to be  kidding me, I'm  going to heckle  this guy, and I'm  going to tell  everybody what a  fraud this product  is.  So he starts  wiping stuff up,  and I start  heckling him,  telling everybody  that the thing's  basically a piece  of crap, and it  doesn't work, and  I was waiting for  him to completely  implode, and he  didn't.  He calmly asked  me to come over,  and he goes,  here, let me show  you how to eat.  Evidently, he 
[02:40:00]  you have to get  the ShamWow, this  doesn't make any  sense, but you  have to get the  ShamWow wet first.  Yes, it's a  Shammy.  If you've ever  used a Shammy,  which they're  normally for years  have been used  to dry top-end  cars, and what  you do is you  get it damp, I  use a Shammy on  my Mustang.  You're an expert  on Shammy's?  On Shammy's.  Just because you  put a wow at the  end of it doesn't  mean it's a  different fucking  animal.  It's a Shammy.  How come you  didn't say this  when I was 
[02:40:30]  bitching about  it two months  ago?  I didn't watch  you use it.  You know what?  You're one of  those Wikipedia  guys.  You just  looked this  shit up, and  now you're just  spitting it back  at me like  you're some  sort of  professor.  I have a  Shammy in my  garage this  very second  that I use  on my Mustang  when I wash  it.  I'd like to  stuff one of  those in  your mouth  and get  all this  saliva out  of your  mouth.  Well, it  probably wouldn't  work because  you'd use it  wrong.  Stick it in  dry.  Stick it in  dry. 
[02:41:00]  Ooh, that  sounds sexy.  Sure does.  Teach him who's  boss.  So Bill, you  have to get  the thing wet.  This guy's  showing you in  front of a lot  of people at  the mall?  You have to  get it wet, but  I've got to  admit it still  doesn't absorb a  fish tank's worth  of water, but it  definitely works  better.  So are you  saving paper  towels?  No, I'm still  buying paper  towels.  Yeah, I went  through, I was  thinking of you,  see, we think of  each other when we  do horrific things  that we know would  upset the other  one.  Yeah.  I was taking a  beer out of the  fridge, of course,  and another one 
[02:41:30]  decided to follow  the one I had  in my hand out  and fell on the  floor and just  exploded.  And instead of  using a towel, a  sponge, or  anything, I used  an entire roll of  paper towels, a  giant roll, and  just went,  frr, frr, frr,  frr, all over  the floor.  So it covered  the entire thing  and then kind of  picked up everything,  the water, the  glass, whatever  dirt was on the  floor at the  time.  And all I  thought is I'm  carrying this  giant, it 
[02:42:00]  looked like a  big paper mache  float head over  to the garbage  was, Bill Burr  would be so  pissed at me  right now for  wasting.  Yeah, he's a  bit greener than  you.  He is.  I literally, I  would have broken  out in hives  watching you do  that.  Hey, Bill, what  about, yeah, go  I gotta tell you  guys this, listen  to this.  I actually, I  got a rat problem  out here in LA.  I pull my car  into the garage,  like, you know, I  come home late at  night, and on  cold nights, if it's 
[02:42:30]  kind of raining out  here, evidently  some, can I curse  on this?  Oh, yes, you  can.  Okay, evidently  some fucking rat  keeps, it crawls up  into my engine when  it's still warm, and  it just snuggles up  in there.  I had no idea, I  kept turning my car  on, and I'm  smelling like this  urine smell.  Oh, it's pissing in  your fucking, like  your heat ducts.  Yeah, it's a  little fucking  bastard, so I  bring my little  baggy hybrid down 
[02:43:00]  to the Toyota  dealership, and  they go, uh...  You sure it  wasn't, you sure  it was a rat and  not the engine?  No, that's a  hamster answer.  Oh, sorry.  Little rascals.  You know, cats will  do that, too, with  the engines, but...  Go ahead, so you  bring it down to the  dealership?  Yeah, so they take  me aside, and they  say that I have rat  droppings in my air  conditioner filter.  Holy shit.  That's hilarious.  Oh, man.  You're breathing in  rat duty.  Yeah, so I  literally, I go, so 
[02:43:30]  immediately, I'm  like, I'm gonna kill  this fucking rat,  right?  Yep.  So, I go to the  hardware store, you  know those little  glue traps that they  have?  Well, the most humane  of all rat traps.  Yes.  Where they stay  alive for a week.  Why not hire 10  mice to stab it?  I highly recommend  the glue traps.  A lot of fun to see  the damn thing  struggling, and I'm  not an animal guy,  but wow, when you  see their ears stuck  to the fucking  glue.  Oh, that's great.  Their face is  stuck.  And they're making  noises you didn't  think a rat could  make.  Looks like E-Rock 
[02:44:00]  would fluff on his  head.  Yeah.  All right, so you  got the glue traps  there, Bill.  Yeah, so, yeah,  because basically they  scared the hell out of  me saying somebody  else had the same  thing happened to  their car, and the  stupid rat crawled up  in there, started  chewing up wires, and  basically disabled this  entire hybrid.  So I'm in a panic now  that I'm going to lose  a $20,000, $22,000 car  because it's some  fucking rat.  So I buy, like,  literally 30 of those  fucking glue traps, and  I just duct tape them  to a, you know, to 
[02:44:30]  like a cardboard box, and  I just slid it  underneath my car.  Don't tell me your  car got stuck in the  trap because it didn't  have the power to  fucking back.  Now, that's fucking  That's because you  drive, right?  That is great.  That's fucking  powerful.  You just killed the  bitch.  No, come on.  No, listen, I, I,  Mia, Mia, my  girlfriend, stinks  at driving.  She's a typical city  girl.  She got her driver's  license when she was  like 36.  Yeah.  So, I, I, I put the 
[02:45:00]  stupid trap things  underneath the car, and  she goes to go to the  gym, and I'm in the  apartment, and I'm  thinking, oh, shit, I  didn't tell her about the  rat traps.  I gotta make sure I, you  know, when she comes  home, I put the car in  the garage, and right  before she drives in the  driveway, I get a phone  call, and as I'm getting  off the phone, she comes  walking in the back, and  I'm like, freaking out,  going, did you see the  rat trap?  She's like, yeah, no  problem, I pull in.  Dude, I go downstairs, she  drove right over the  fucking thing.  I literally had to spend 
[02:45:30]  like 45 minutes on my  knees in rat turds with  this screwdriver trying to  get this fucking thing  off of my tire.  Why don't you just  drove down the road  like that?  Oh, shit.  Two of them were stuck  on my pathetic excuse  for a fucking tire, and I  was just sitting there,  the words coming out of  my mouth, it was  brutal.  I don't give a shit.  This doesn't happen to  people who have real  cars.  I think I'm over the  hybrid.  Yeah, you really should 
[02:46:00]  get over that.  It's not, it really, I  don't see it making much  of a difference.  You know, the price of  gas is down.  Are you looking at  Wikipedia again,  Anthony?  No.  Are you scrolling down  right now?  Anthonypedia.  That's me.  Hey, Bill, you know  they say if you have  one rat, that means  you have many rats.  Oh, absolutely.  I learned that from  Jim Norton, because  I came in here with  a little mouse problem.  I said, I got this  dumb mouse in my  apartment.  Jimmy goes, if you  have one, that means  you have a lot.  You're infested, if you 
[02:46:30]  could see one.  And sure enough, I  had 60 kills under my  belt before I moved  out of that joint.  And what, you  used the glue?  You know what?  The glue really  bothered me.  You wake up in the  morning and there's  like a mama fucking  mouse with a couple  babies on its back,  all glued to the  trap.  I'm like, I can't deal  with this.  So I got the  electric ones that  zapped them.  You've got to finish  them off.  That's the problem.  That's the problem.  Finish them off.  No, he's right, though,  because you can't just  throw them in the  garbage and go,  you know, you've got to  smash their little 
[02:47:00]  heads.  Some people do that  because they don't have  the nerve to kill the  rat, so they just  throw it into the  garbage and throw  along.  You know, the  person's suffering.  The person's  suffering.  No, Bill makes a  good point.  If you're going to be  brave enough to use the  glue traps, you've got to  finish them off.  You've got to finish  them off.  You can't be a  pussy.  You've got to be like  Commodus and give them  the thumbs down and then  go in there.  I was smashing their  little mouse heads.  I forgot what I used.  I was going to call you  and try to figure out 
[02:47:30]  because after my rage  went down and I put the  glue traps underneath my  car, I was kind of  thinking like, man, some  rats are like as big as  a cat.  How am I going to finish  this thing off?  You know, I don't have a  gun.  I'm not getting anywhere  near it because I'm not  going to get bit.  I was thinking about  getting like a sword or  something.  Yeah, that would probably  work from a distance.  You could do that.  How about a medieval  mace or maybe a suit of  iron and a fucking  horse?  Smash them.  Jesus fucking  pill.  Why don't you joust it? 
[02:48:00]  Rats.  If it was a mouse, I  could just put on some  fucking work boots and  step on the thing.  But if it's a rat, you  know?  Yeah.  Well, if you get them on  like if it's just one  piece of that sticky  stuff, you could use the  old car.  If you had a good car,  you just put them under  the tire and let old  reverse do the dirty  work.  Oh, yeah, it's true.  Well, if my luck,  somebody would film it  and the cruelty to rat  people would come over  and stop protesting.  You know what?  Yeah, fuck them. 
[02:48:30]  Fuck them.  Yeah, you got to live  your life.  You're living there for  fuck's sake.  You're driving that car.  You don't want rat piss  and shit.  You could get that  fucking Hunter virus  from rat droppings.  Yeah, my cheap  fucking landlord  to solve the problem  because my apartment's  nice, but the garage,  I swear to God,  the thing's from like  1935.  You literally see  through it.  So he sends two  people over here.  Not only do they not  even speak English,  they got like this  particle board that 
[02:49:00]  they're using to fill  up some of the holes.  And I swear to God,  you know what?  The guys could use  in a fucking  like a miter,  not a miter saw,  like a skill saw.  And this is how  broke the people  were that he sent  over here.  You know what he's  using for a sawhorse?  What?  His fucking thigh.  A what?  His thigh?  Yeah, he just,  he had the board there  and it's slipping  and he's just  using the skill saw.  I had to look away.  Wow, yeah.  This guy is going  to cut his fucking  leg off. 
[02:49:30]  Entertainment value  at least.  No kidding.  Wow, that is,  that's creepy.  All right,  I'm going to end  a minute ago.  Hey, Bill,  by the way.  Yeah, that's okay.  I think you did okay.  No, you did very well.  Bill, you called me.  I apologize.  I didn't call you back.  I forgot.  As soon as I heard  you were on the phone,  my shame hit me.  I realized I never  called you back  so I apologize.  Shame.  Shame.  Hey, Bill.  Your own shame  washed over you, Jimmy?  I just realized,  you know,  you called me.  I realized I forgot  to call you back  so I'm sorry.  Oh, you're a fancy guy, Jimmy. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, yeah, no,  no, I'm not saying  I should have.  I'm just saying  I'm sorry I didn't.  I just figured  your people  hadn't gotten  in contact with you yet.  Yeah, when I have  messages,  I'll just tell somebody,  like, have somebody  call Bill  and tell them,  you know.  Busy.  Busy.  Hey, Bill,  you're into those  late night products.  Have you seen  the Snuggies yet?  The Snuggies?  No.  Oh, you're into  ShamWow  and you haven't seen  the Snuggie?  That's late night TV,  my friend.  It's all blanket  for a pedophile.  It's blankets  with sleeves.  Yeah, it's a blanket  with sleeves. 
[02:50:30]  It makes you look  like a cult member.  It's the most horrific thing.  You've got to look  it up online.  It's a fucking robe  that you put on backwards.  Yeah.  It's pretty much...  Does it have a hood?  No.  It should have a hood.  It's just a blanket  with fucking sleeves.  It's the most ridiculous thing.  It's horrible.  It was big for Christmas.  The latest thing I bought,  I bought that P90X thing.  Have you seen that?  No.  What the fuck is that?  What is that?  The fighter plane?  It's basically guys like us,  guys who are right around 40  who have sort of  stayed in shape.  It's your last-ditch  attempt to get shredded. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, no.  And, uh...  No, it's actually...  This one is actually  really good.  I highly recommend it,  but you have to do the diet.  Is it a machine  or a supplement or...?  Yeah, what is it?  It's basically...  It's like...  It's 12, like,  hour-long DVDs.  Uh-oh.  And they...  Remember that muscle  confusion thing  that I was making fun of  saying everybody  in their 40s  is going to need  a hip replacement  in 10 years?  That's what it is?  Well, some days  it's regular, like,  push-ups and weightlifting, 
[02:51:30]  and then other days  it's stuff like  I never heard of,  like, plyometrics.  And they got you  jumping around  like you're going to  play cornerback  in the Super Bowl.  And, uh...  It definitely makes you  drop some weight,  but your hips  start talking to you  after a while.  Not made for the hips.  No.  No.  Oh, God.  It should have ended  this two minutes ago.  I told you it should have  ended after the rat story.  I don't know why  you guys haven't hung up on me.  That story was fantastic.  Yeah.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  See you soon, man.  All right, Bill.  Thank you for putting up  with that last two minutes. 
[02:52:00]  No, it's all good.  And, uh,  thank you for Joe DeRosa.  He did our show  a couple times.  He did pretty well for us.  Oh, yeah.  He called me up.  He was all excited about it.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  He's obviously  one of your boys,  so we appreciate it.  All right, Bill.  See you soon, will you?  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Bill Burr, everyone.  Uh, where's intern David?  Executive intern David  has been working the crowd.  Where is intern David?  And Sam is his handler.  This is like a wrestling thing.  Sam, come on in when you're...  Yeah.  Sam's got to kind of  leech himself on 
[02:52:30]  to whoever is  popular for the minute.  You're like a...  That was classic.  The fucking bottom  of his microphone  with the batteries  and the transmits  just fell off of his mic.  Whose mic?  Sam's.  It just fucking  fell off onto the floor.  Totally disabling  the microphone, by the way.  I've been on  the David bandwagon  since day one.  There's no leech here.  Have you? 
[02:53:00]  Yes.  I do like David.  Day one.  David's good.  All right.  So what do we got, Sam?  Any observations  as he was working the crowd?  Yeah, he got to meet  some really interesting people  and asked a lot  of line of questioning.  His main question  when he couldn't get  to like a really  interesting story was  what did you do yesterday?  Ah, that's good  because people did  something yesterday  if they're here  and alive today.  Or one of his other tricks  would be  how did you get here?  And they'd usually  say by train  and then he'd say  what happened  on the train ride? 
[02:53:30]  Ah, see?  You're good.  You get a scenario.  Yeah.  And then if it doesn't work  like something's not funny  it leaves you an out  to get another story  out of the same  kind of question.  Too bad we're not  interviewing Long Island Railroad  people from 15 years ago.  It'd be a hell of a funny show.  Oh, a black Jamaican  shot me and my friend  in the face.  Oh, and then what happened?  What do you think happened?  You're right.  All right, David,  you worked the crowd  for about a half hour.  Well, 20 minutes, whatever.  What did you find out?  Anything good for the show? 
[02:54:00]  No, we got a couple  of things.  Honestly, the crowd  was very non-talkative  to be quite honest.  What do you mean?  Well, okay, the crowd sucks  is what David's saying.  That is kind of true.  Oof.  David, why does the crowd  suck, David?  I was asking all these questions  like what do you do  for a living?  Like we have any  interesting stories  at your job?  What did you do yesterday?  About the train ride over?  And they were saying  no, no, I don't have  anything, sorry,  nothing interesting.  I have nothing funny  to share with ONA, no.  So you're saying  they were lackluster?  They were.  We got a couple of,  we do have a couple of,  I'm not saying  we have nothing,  but it's a couple  of zingers out there, huh? 
[02:54:30]  Dave did say  that they were  especially boring people.  Really?  Yes.  Yeah.  But we do have  a couple of things  we can share.  All right,  what did you find out?  Who would you like  to bring in, David?  Three sheets of paper there.  Well, David,  you want to be on air,  so this is a good  exercise for you.  Yeah.  So, David,  are you saying  they're lackluster?  Say it into the mic.  They were lackluster, yes.  Don't talk to Sam privately.  Say whatever you were  going to say to Sam  into the mic.  Yeah.  With a fist in between 
[02:55:00]  the mic and hopefully  moving toward your face  at great velocity.  Or how about  just ten E-Rock cocks?  Jesus,  almost six?  Oh, you,  eight?  Oh, yeah,  we couldn't talk  about his cock over there.  He doesn't have a cock,  he's got a weenie.  You know what Eric has?  A pud.  A pud.  But he must have  one giant ball, though.  I think it was both balls.  It was both balls  and makes one huge ball.  What do you think, David?  You saw what the...  I took a closer look 
[02:55:30]  like when he was  standing by me  and it was  a nut sack  and then this little  pud  coming off of it  and that kind of  gave him a little more.  I have to agree with you,  Opie.  I only noticed one ball.  I agree.  It looked like one huge ball.  I know he has two,  but it just looked like  one big clump.  Well, they come in one sack,  you know.  I know.  Did you notice his cock bulge?  I did notice that, yes.  I noticed that, yes.  Was it delicious to you?  No.  It's hard not to notice, though, right?  It's a big fat pouch of meat.  Yeah, so you couldn't not see it. 
[02:56:00]  If you were looking at him,  it's kind of hard not to notice.  It was just like  staring at me in the face.  Just that, well...  Oh, right in the face?  Oh, really?  It was like looking right at me.  It was bulging out, yeah.  Wow.  What about the cock par?  Was it big, you think?  It was pretty big, yeah.  I don't know what it was.  Maybe it was the fluff  or something got him  really super excited.  The fluffer?  What?  The fluff?  The fluff.  Something got him super excited.  Yeah, I got it.  We got it.  Yeah, we heard you.  You said the same fucking inflection,  same everything.  You're amazing.  Where is Iraq real quick?  Eric, he... 
[02:56:30]  Oh, he's in there.  Eric is not...  Yes, he is.  Eric has the stuff out of his hair.  That mic works over there, too.  Yeah.  Iraq, how did you get the stuff  out of your hair?  Because it's like  you look normal now.  You look the same.  Very hot water  continuously dumped  all over my head.  How hot?  Very hot.  Like steaming hot.  You said another word  before.  Piping?  Scalding?  All right.  What kind?  You heard me. 
[02:57:00]  No, I didn't.  You heard me.  Yes, of course you did.  That's why we want to  hear it again.  I think it's...  I never heard of...  I'm so sorry  that the water  reprimanded you.  Do parents scold you a lot  in your childhood?  No.  No?  No.  Scalding hot water  on your head?  Yes.  David says you got  a nice piece.  Right there?  Yeah, he was complimenting  your balls.  Why don't you tell Iraqis?  Not your cock 
[02:57:30]  because it's a pud  we've decided.  Not a...  Pud.  I haven't heard that.  I have not heard  pud used for dick  in years.  One time.  You're a fucking  gonna go home  and pound your pud.  Pud.  Do you have just  a giant, like,  ball bag?  I don't know.  We want to know  about your genitals.  Yeah.  Because David  was commenting  under the press  about the cock.  David, why don't you  tell Iraqis?  He's here now.  What were you saying  about his ball bag  and his cock?  And his pud? 
[02:58:00]  I was saying  that he got super excited  and looked pretty big.  super excited.  Not used to it  from his people.  Ooh.  Wow.  That wasn't very nice.  No, it wasn't.  It wasn't very good either.  Yeah.  What'd you say, Tank?  You heard it.  Tank has a big bulge.  Yeah.  So that's what I'm saying  that he had a big bulge  and he looked like  he had a huge nutsack  but it was combined  as one big, huge nutsack.  Just looked like one ball.  One ball, yeah.  Like combined, yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:58:30]  Basically, like  it's like an idiot factory.  Sorry, Rocky.  Yes.  All right, David.  So what do we got  from the audience?  I see you wrote some notes.  Yeah, we wrote some notes.  He's shuffling through.  We got a couple of things.  As we discussed,  there were a pretty boring crowd.  They were right there.  And they were lackluster.  I know,  but they weren't given  any good stories.  They weren't.  Actually, a couple of them  started picking fights 
[02:59:00]  and making fun of David.  Of course.  Yes, but if we get to Anthony,  not you, Anthony.  There's one of the guys  in the crowd was Anthony.  Believe it or not.  Wow.  One of the guys in the crowd,  his name was Anthony.  You rarely hear that.  That is an odd coincidence.  Yes, one of the guys  in the crowd was Anthony.  You act like it's the old bitch.  Oh, no.  Danny found a great picture  of a pud.  Giant ball sack  with little pud.  Yeah.  Eric's cock head  is probably so spongy 
[02:59:30]  that even when he has  a full heart on,  it just collapses  into the dick  when you touch it.  Now, get back to the wonder  of more than one Anthony.  Yeah, which is crazy.  You act like his name  is Sven Cumia.  So there's a guy  in the crowd named Anthony.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, fascinating.  That's one of them,  Anthony from Toronto.  Oh.  Oh, Canada.  Yes.  And?  And he works  with the family business  making pasta.  What kind of pasta?  Canadian pasta. 
[03:00:00]  He makes Canadian pasta.  Genco olive oil.  And you might think,  oh, pasta.  I tell you,  no, he makes Canadian pasta.  What is that all about?  That's crazy.  Pasta that needs  stronger pasta  to defend it  from invading pasta.  I'm still trying  to figure out  what the hell  Canadian pasta is.  Maybe we should ask him.  All right,  you want to bring him in?  I mean,  I'm going to roll up  and smoke it  and get really stoned from it.  All right.  Yeah, probably, right?  And?  Observe when he comes in.  Observe him.  Oh, let's observe. 
[03:00:30]  Observe how he's coming in.  Why?  He's walking in.  Why are you making fun  of the fact  that he has a cane?  Because that's part  of the information.  That's part of the story  that I gathered from him.  There's a horrible  pasta factory accident.  No, no.  Yes.  Good evening.  Good evening, sir.  What happened, sir?  Just slip on  some angel hair.  No.  I twisted my knee  playing soccer.  All right.  As long as you didn't  trip over a box  of bow ties.  Yes.  Okay.  You want to know  what happened today?  What happened to him?  What happened?  Today,  he tried to sneak 
[03:01:00]  into K-Rock.  And while he was  trying to sneak  into K-Rock,  he was trying  to get into the elevator  and the security guard  chased him.  But he couldn't  run away fast  because he had a cane  and he had a twist  at his knee.  So a security guard  was chasing after  someone with a twisted knee.  That's crazy.  The security guard  was chasing after  a disabled person  is what I found  out from him.  Wow.  That's insanity.  Jesus.  How do you get  13 episodes around  now?  We got a show.  What's going on  over there?  That's crazy.  Why was he trying  to sneak into K-Rock 
[03:01:30]  there?  Yeah.  What's there to see  there?  I think he's a big  fan of you guys.  You think?  What's there to see you?  Yeah.  Hold on.  What was your first clue?  Yeah.  Exactly.  He's a guy  and he's fat.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he's right there.  I love you, Jimmy.  I love you.  He's right there, though.  So listen, I don't want  to make fun of cuff pants.  So you're from Canada.  You're in the family.  Pasta making business.  Yeah.  Now what happened  to K-Rock?  Well, we didn't know  exactly what we had  to do to get in.  So we just walked  in the door,  started walking  towards the elevator,  and this guy come up, 
[03:02:00]  excuse me, sir.  You sign in.  You sign in.  I go, oh, since when?  And he goes,  what's your name?  I look on the list for you.  And he looked at my name.  He found an Anthony,  but not with my last name.  So he goes,  no, you got to go.  He just kicked us out.  You got to go?  Me and my brother.  So he kicked us out?  Yeah.  You and your brother?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's, uh...  Boring.  That's story.  The point of the story.  The point of the story 
[03:02:30]  is that the security guard  was chasing after  a disabled person.  Right.  I'm sure he was chasing me.  Proving Danny's point,  by the way.  I'm with you, Danny.  Over and over again.  The Canadian pasta is...  How many times  will he do it on...  But what do you mean...  He's saying that  it wasn't much of a story.  What do you say  the story was?  That's a story.  That's a story to know about.  Yeah, but David,  so he chased a guy?  Yes.  All right.  Who was chasing him, though?  The security guard.  Oh, but he's fucking disabled.  Yes, that's why  it's an interesting story.  All right.  Interesting story.  It's also interesting 
[03:03:00]  because he has Canadian pasta.  Well, let's ask him  about that, David.  Go ahead.  Can you explain to us  what Canadian pasta is  and how it differs  from Italian pasta?  It's not Canadian pasta.  It's made in Canada.  That's it.  Therefore, it's Canadian, right?  No.  No, that's not how it works.  No, it's the same,  you know, product.  Before we go any further,  this is information  that this gentleman  gave David  while they were talking  out there.  He said...  David said,  oh, Canadian pasta.  The guy says,  no, it's Italian pasta.  We just make it there. 
[03:03:30]  And David said,  oh, Canadian pasta.  Right.  Because he didn't hear  anything past that.  I heard it.  I just chose  to go with Canadian pasta.  To ignore it.  So what do you call  Chinese food  that's made in America?  American Chinese food.  Whoa.  American Chinese food?  Yes.  So Canadian pasta.  God, I wish.  Thank you.  American Chinese food.  Is this all we got  on this guy?  That's all we got  on this guy, yes.  And that was the go-to one  that you chose first,  like you're a big opener.  Yeah, if that was your... 
[03:04:00]  If I'm your big opener,  then you have no future  in this.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Toronto.  Sir, yes.  Thank you.  We had all our Canadian  friends out there.  We got many fans,  many fans from Canadian.  Oh, Canada.  All right, David.  What do we got next?  There is another interesting.  We have...  Another interesting.  Can we get to the first  interesting...  Yes, you can either say  and interesting  or we have boring number two.  We've got another  interesting person, though. 
[03:04:30]  There's a husband and wife  here from Pennsylvania.  We have Karen from Pennsylvania.  All righty.  She's interesting.  Why is she?  She's a nurse.  Oh.  And she's also...  A woman wears short sleeves  that are too short for  so she looks like a psychopath?  No, she's interesting  because she has an interesting...  My dad is a psychopath.  What she does is  when she's a nurse in surgery...  Well, David,  she's a type of nurse.  What type of nurse is she?  I don't know.  I can't pronounce it.  What is it anesthesi...  Not an anesthesiologist.  What is the type of nurse you are?  I'm a nurse anesthetist.  A nurse anesthetist? 
[03:05:00]  Anasthetist?  Anasthetist.  What's that?  I have no idea  what a nurse anesthetist is.  No.  Maybe she can...  Can you care to explain, Karen?  I give anesthesia to patients  while they're having surgery.  But what's the difference  between that and an anesthesiologist?  They make more money than I do.  Are you not at that level yet?  No.  They actually supervise three of us  so they'll overlook us.  They'll look at the paper,  the computer.  They'll see the patients.  We actually do their anesthesia,  take care of them.  That's crazy.  I don't want you doing my anesthesia.  I want the main guy doing it. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  But we do it better than the main guy.  That's how they do it  all the time now.  They just delegate.  She's like the executive intern.  Well, then why can't you be the main guy  if you're actually doing it?  Because I'm a nurse  and not a doctor.  Anesthesiologist is a doctor?  Yes.  Oh, I didn't know that.  And they make a shitload of money.  Yes, they do.  I think Malcolm March  is an anesthesiologist.  But he's watching you,  you know,  your nurses  and saying,  all right,  give him this,  give him that.  No, we actually just  give what we think.  If we have problems,  we'll call them.  They're not there with us.  No?  No.  You give what you think? 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  What kind of surgeries?  Wow.  Anything.  I do pretty much anything  but labor and delivery  or open heart.  Holy shit.  You get to take a little  home with you?  Yeah.  No, I'd get in big trouble.  I don't have to pee  in front of people  and pee in a cup.  Do they make you pee a lot?  No, no.  They would if they suspected you, though.  Right, right.  These are the questions  David asked, right?  Oh, yeah.  Sorry, sorry.  What am I doing?  David, go ahead.  I know.  What are you doing  asking silly, stupid questions  of this woman  when David's already  pre-interviewed? 
[03:06:30]  Yes.  Yes.  All right, David.  Dad.  So, I kind of inquired  about her  and if she had  any interesting stories  to tell about  one particular surgery  she was performing.  And she did have  an interesting  particular surgery.  Oh, she did?  I think she would like  to share  when she was working  at giving anesthesia  to one patient  getting a breast reduction.  Yeah.  Getting a breast reduction.  Ah, breast reduction.  Breast reduction surgery.  Like Punky Brewster.  All right, so wait. 
[03:07:00]  She got one of those.  It's like Carson.  Like doing breast reduction.  You need some index cards  to tap on the desk.  No.  Breast reduction.  Yeah, he's tapping  breast reduction.  So she's had breast reduction?  Who cares?  No, she hasn't.  No, I haven't.  She was performing a surgery.  She was in the surgery.  Ask her how big her boobs  are there, David.  She was in the surgery  and she has an interesting  story to tell about it.  But what?  Ask her about her boobs first.  Maybe you should let her tell it.  No, ask her about her boobs first.  The twitch.  I don't think we want  to know about that.  We want to know about the story.  I don't want to talk  about my boobs.  We want to know  about her story.  She wants to talk  about her boobs  so ask her about her boobs. 
[03:07:30]  Sam is tapping him  and he twitches like crazy.  It's so funny.  David, how...  She doesn't even know  that.  Hey, Jimmy leaned over  and he tenses up.  I just had to ask you  what was she...  She was doing  a breast reduction surgery  and she...  No, she wasn't doing this.  Yeah, she was doing  the anesthesia  during the surgery.  Yeah, because she's  the anesthesia nurse.  Anesthesia, whatever it is.  The anesthetist.  Anesthetist, yes.  Yes.  I think we should  let her tell the story.  Okay.  She knows how to tell it.  She knows how to tell the story. 
[03:08:00]  It's pretty funny.  When David gets tapped...  It's pretty funny.  He has an Elvis lip  real quick.  Yes.  He's like a fainting goat  but he's not a goat  and he stands there.  All right.  You don't like to be touched,  do you, David?  No, but I think  we should let her  tell the story.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  I was giving anesthesia  for a breast reduction surgery  which I know.  Ooh, how big a pair  of tits were they?  They were pretty darn big.  Was she a big girl?  Yeah, but she also  had neck pain,  shoulder pain  when they're too big  that, you know,  that happens  and I know that's hard  to fathom  but it does  and the way they do it 
[03:08:30]  is if they're really big  they cut off the nipple  and the areola  and they put it aside  and then they shape  the breast the right way  and they put the nipple back  so it's nice and perky  and where it should be.  What, do they roll it  like a tube of toothpaste  and squeeze out  the extra titty?  I don't think  that would work.  So unfortunately  one of the nipples  got dropped on the floor.  Oh no.  Really?  Wait, did a dog run in  and eat it?  A small schnauzer.  There's a rifle 
[03:09:00]  through dog shit  to get the nipple back  and hope that she didn't notice  that it was brown  with a fucking kibble on it.  Is the nipple  completely removed  from any blood flow  and everything?  Yes, it's just the layer  the brown areola  and the nipple  and it's just  it's cut off  just a really thin layer  of it  and they put it aside  and then they  reshape the breast  and they cut it out.  I would assume  it would have to be  reattached pretty quickly.  No, they just put it  in some saline solution  and keep it nice and nice.  Okay.  Right.  They finish up 
[03:09:30]  so it back on.  That's scary.  That's a magic solution.  Yeah, Salie,  you're right.  Salie, put your eyes.  Dropped it on the floor.  Yeah.  How did it get knocked  on the floor?  Was somebody doing  some kind of  an impression of a movie?  I think the container  it was in  got bumped off accidentally  by somebody.  Using two of them  as castanets?  The container got knocked  because it probably  hit the floor  and then the nipple  just kind of flew out  and did it roll?  I didn't see it.  Like a suckable marble?  It was one of those  oh shit moments 
[03:10:00]  in surgery  where everybody goes  what?  Yeah, so put the fucking  thing in alcohol  and throw it back on.  Well, they actually  put it in an antibiotic solution.  Okay.  Rinsed it off  and then they  eventually sewed it back on.  That's the whole thing?  That's it.  Was there a dust bunny on it?  I didn't look.  Came up with a search  or a penny on it?  Oh, I'm dirty.  When it finally stopped rolling  did it go  when you drop a quarter?  Lucky you didn't have  a cat in that room.  Kind of like the dog joke  but I switched species.  So was everything all right 
[03:10:30]  or did Eric get an infection?  God damn, Danny.  Ouch.  He was fine.  Ouch.  Actually, it was a woman, wasn't it?  Yeah, it was a literal gem.  That's a funny line.  Is that it, David?  That's it with her.  That was a funny story.  Wow.  That was any good.  I want to reiterate  how funny it was.  I want to thank  the healthy lady die  for telling her story today.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh. 
[03:11:00]  I said healthy lady die, though.  I changed it up.  I could have just said lady die.  Your sleeves are a little short.  I know I'm tall.  When it's more tall, it's...  See, I wouldn't even be able  to tell if that was like  supposed to be worn like that.  It actually is.  In other words,  I'm calling Jimmy a faggot.  No.  I'm saying sleeves being really short  make a person look crazy.  I'm a little crazy.  You look like a crazy person.  A little crazy, yeah.  I'm short.  I never realized that,  but do they?  Somebody loves to do that.  Mentally ill people 
[03:11:30]  never have clothes that fit  because they're so fucking nuts.  Nobody wants to take away their clothes.  They just can't wear it  until it dies.  And they grow up  and they have short sleeves  and they strangle small animals.  Alrighty.  I just have to admit  I was a little hungover  and I just sort of pulled something on  so we could get here.  So who's your husband out here?  Which one is the husband?  Which one is the husband?  Ah.  What does he do for a living?  Um, I couldn't hear you.  He's a network engineer.  Oh, network engineer.  Why would it work?  Mr. Computer. 
[03:12:00]  Why would it work?  He says.  Why would it?  I'm a network engineer.  Ah, computer guy, huh?  Yep.  Yes.  Network engineer.  For what?  Like freelance?  What do you do?  No, I work for Verizon.  Oh.  What do you do for it?  Well, Jimmy likes that, right?  Thanks for the good.  Hey, are you friends with the guy  who gets the best service ever?  No.  No.  Is he a big shot around Verizon?  Does he walk in in his Verizon uniform  and everybody wants to brain him with a hammer  but they have to be nice?  He's the face on the fucking posters? 
[03:12:30]  We've never met him.  Oh, really?  I know.  I was just kidding.  Really?  Really worked there.  You're one of the guys that are standing behind everybody with your phones, right?  I'm part of the network.  Wow, great.  That's pretty neat, huh?  Thanks.  Do you have Verizon service?  Hey, by the way, what is it that makes Verizon?  Because AT&T sucks a fucking pile of dicks  and I've heard mixed reviews on Sprint.  What does Verizon use that's different than AT&T?  Magic, Jimmy.  It is magic.  I thought so.  Yes.  Do they have little goblins? 
[03:13:00]  No, I think Verizon just has more cell towers across the country  and has better coverage than AT&T.  But isn't there something else?  My ex-brother-in-law used to work for them.  He said there's something like a chip  that they don't share with the other phones  and the other phones have to share with each other.  I'm not too sure.  It's like Verizon Wireless.  I actually worked for Verizon Business.  Oh.  Hey, and mind your own, Jim.  That's right.  Why?  Does he work for Verizon's beeswax?  Ask him what kind of phone he has.  Ask him what his cell phone is, Jimmy.  What's that?  Oh. 
[03:13:30]  Ask him what kind of cell phone he has.  All right.  How big's your cock?  It's huge.  I ask when I want to ask.  I know it's an iPod.  It is.  It's an iPhone.  It's an iPhone.  An iPhone?  Of course it is.  Well, how's your reception where you live?  In Pennsylvania, I actually have good iPhone reception.  It's fine.  I haven't had any problems with it.  Okay, that's the thing.  Put a few apps on there.  By the way, who's the fucking Francis from Stripes  mental patient in the back?  Oh, my God.  He's a psychotic fuck.  Me?  Actually, he looks like, what's his name from Lost? 
[03:14:00]  Oh, my God.  He does.  Yeah.  Let's hope he suffers the same thing.  You look kind of crazy, man.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What do you want?  What do you want?  Blow jobs.  Okay.  Apparently, he's a genie.  All right.  David, are we done with the story here?  Do you want to know more stories from her?  Do you want to keep talking to her?  Does she have anything else?  No, you're the one that was supposed to.  I'd like to know more.  Have you been a part of any interesting or different types of surgeries or weird surgeries? 
[03:14:30]  She told you that.  The nipple fucking thing.  That's a normal surgery.  That's just an accident that happened.  A nipple falling on the floor?  What do you think?  A different head on someone's fucking body?  What do you think she's done?  I want to know.  I want to know.  It's not going to get better than that.  You've got to cut your losses.  That's as good as it is.  Yes.  That's the story.  The nipple falling on the floor.  It's hysterical.  It's a scream.  Anybody else from the crowd, David?  We got a couple other people.  What was wrong most of them, David?  What?  How come there weren't too many good answers?  They were just lackluster.  And they were saying, like, I don't have any interesting stories to tell. 
[03:15:00]  I don't have anything.  But is it that they were all lackluster or they didn't want to talk to you?  I think it was they were pretty much all lackluster, yeah.  I'm not trying to be rude.  I don't want to be.  No, you're being honest.  I don't want to be rude.  I don't think they want to be called lackluster.  I know they don't want to be, but that's what they were, yeah.  They were basically, it was basically a collection of duds.  But I do have another guy that we talked to for a bit.  All right, let's see.  What do you got?  We have Kevin.  Sam.  What's Kevin all about?  Kevin is all about that he's from, happens to be from Maranek, which is the same place 
[03:15:30]  as where Sam is from.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Oh.  I ditched a car there once.  They're from the same town.  They're from the same town.  They didn't know each other.  Ah.  And Kevin told Sam about a place in Maranek, a restaurant, like a deli, that Sam never  even heard of.  He doesn't even know.  Sam doesn't.  He just learned that Sam doesn't know half the restaurants in his own town.  That place is where he lives.  What a dumb cunt.  And you thought this would be worth talking about on the radio.  Yes.  You found a guy that's from Sam's town.  There's more. 
[03:16:00]  There's more.  This is almost not even worth thinking alone, much less talking about the two countries.  Well, let's bring in the Maranek restaurant, fucking maybe.  Well, there's more to this guy.  Oh, there's more to it.  At the end of talking to Kevin, he quietly leaned into me and said, this is the best guy  we've talked to.  Oh, you saved it for last.  Why is he the best guy we've talked to?  Because this guy is a dispatcher for a limousine company.  Oh, my God.  Dispatcher for a limousine company.  What does he have?  So, do you have an interesting story besides selling Judd Hirsch's sweater for taxi? 
[03:16:30]  I'm going to talk to him.  Holy shit.  Jesus.  He's right there.  Well, it's not so much an interesting story since we tried to inquire some questions about  him to see if we can get him to do certain things.  Oh, okay.  Let's, uh...  We'll watch this.  Go ahead, David.  We tried to inquire.  Since he lives in the same town as Sam, we tried to inquire if he can get his limousine  service to pick up Sam at his house every day and bring him to work.  God damn, that's crazy.  See, you mean you wanted to get Sam a ride in a limo? 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  If he lives in the same town as Sam and he's a limo dispatcher, he can get his limousine  company to pick up Sam and drive him here for free.  I mean, that's the least he could do for Sam.  Yeah.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  All right, sir.  What?  How's it going?  Welcome to the show.  Thank you for having me.  Sure.  What's, uh...  Now, David's painting this crazy...  I mean, this is the stuff movies are made of, you know?  You and Sam live in the town.  All of a sudden, you drive Sam.  Sam gets here with the same thing we always... 
[03:17:30]  It's crazy.  How do you feel about David's...  Oh, he's a fantastic interviewer.  Yeah, he is good, isn't he?  Yes, he's full of insightful questions.  David, get something out of him.  Yeah, come on, David.  You picked him from the audience.  You picked him from the audience.  What is it?  Oh, David, David, real fast.  What did you have to say for me?  From my, uh...  Hmm?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He wanted to say that he wanted to give a big ups to his cousin, Jerome.  I just wanted to mention that.  Big ups are always good for the show. 
[03:18:00]  We love big ups.  I'm a big fan of the big ups.  Yep.  So you thought bringing someone in for a big ups was good?  Well, as I said before, most of the people aren't that good that we talked to, so this  is pretty good.  Fuck you!  Oh, they're just yelling, fuck you out there.  So, Kevin, what did you think about this?  Would you consider asking your limousine company to try to give Sam free rides a work?  You're going with the bit, huh?  Yeah, I could see if we could arrange something like that, obviously, for some plugola. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, plugola.  That's what we want to announce on the air is that you would mention it.  I'll exchange favors for plugs.  For free stuff, right.  To get free stuff, you would plug his limo company.  Oh, yeah.  We're not allowed to do that?  Um, uh, wow.  I guess not.  Oh, well, then someone's going to have a few problems about those products I was promised.  I'm kidding.  Not only did I stop the flow of the show, but I bombed so badly. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  My apologies to the audience here and abroad.  That was, uh...  We didn't even initially know you bombed, because you have to know there's a joke maybe coming.  I know.  It was basically, what I did was, I just, you were all standing here.  It's like everyone was at a wake, and I just rolled a bowling ball in front of the coffin.  And you all went, what was that?  That's funnier.  Yeah, I know it is. 
[03:19:30]  He was laying there in a bowling ball.  See that?  You pull yourself out with the familiar.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  The familiar.  It works.  Ah, David.  Yeah, the line of questioning.  Forget about the limo ride and stuff.  Just go with something else.  Riff.  Riff with the guy.  Yeah, get some out of them.  So what's this deli that you introduced Sam to that's in the same town as you both live in?  Mm, Maranek.  Yeah, the name of the deli is Anthony's Deli.  Another ant something with Anthony.  Wow.  Holy shit. 
[03:20:00]  We're going crazy.  Anthony with a deli?  That's insanity.  A Time Live commercial.  Yeah.  The third Anthony we've had today.  Wow.  Oh.  Oh.  David.  Holy shit.  Yeah, how about that?  Unbelievable.  How about that?  What else, David?  Lack of charisma and insight.  That's going to be his favorite sandwich from the deli, maybe.  What do you like about this deli?  What's so good about it?  He wants to enjoy this.  What's so good about this deli?  Oh, man.  They just give you a pretty good deli. 
[03:20:30]  What kind of food?  Hold on.  You go to the deli and they give you a pretty good deli?  They give you a pretty good selection of whatever you want.  Pretty much.  I'm sure.  What would you like?  I'll take one of everything and the deli.  Johnny on the spot over here.  And the building, right?  Right.  It's the deli deli.  What's your favorite food to eat at this deli?  It's the deli deli, you're right.  Chicken cutlets, the meatballs, the...  Anything.  Anything.  Would you consider taking...  Meeting up with Sam and taking Sam and introducing him to this deli? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We could have a play date.  A play date?  Uh-oh.  We could do something.  Uh-oh.  Sam, how do you feel about this?  Would you have a play date with Kevin?  I think Kevin should show you around the town.  I mean, you live in Maranoke and you don't have a clue what goes on there.  Right?  Again, he says it.  Maybe Kevin should take you around the town and show you around the town.  Introduce you to the sites and sounds of Maranoke.  Don't the two of us live far away?  No, you're both of them are Maranoke.  Whoa!  Would you like Kevin to take you on a tour of Maranoke?  No, thank you.  No!  It's a retarded child. 
[03:21:30]  How many times are you going to say it?  You don't think you'd be a good tour guide?  What town is he even living?  What?  For the town of Maranoke.  You're insulting this guy.  What if you want to do so you're on town?  Not so much.  What's he going to show me?  Why don't you ask him?  Why don't you ask him?  If you were taking Sam on a tour of Maranoke, what sites would you show him?  Where would you show him around?  Danny just threw him in his head.  I can listen to this all day.  I don't know why.  Not much to see, actually.  Nothing?  Nothing.  What goes on in Maranoke every day?  What do you guys do for fun?  Nothing. 
[03:22:00]  Where do you hang out?  People leave there to go to work.  Are there any hot spots you can show Sam?  He's obviously unfamiliar.  I just don't know the deli.  You don't know the deli?  You don't know the limousine service?  Don't know this guy?  Don't know Anthony?  Yeah, I guess the center of all the culture in Maranoke.  Maybe.  I think these two should hang out this afternoon.  We're just looking at TV.  We didn't mean to distract you.  Do we have one more guy outside? 
[03:22:30]  Okay, thank you very much, Kevin.  He doesn't even look at him.  He just goes, thank you very much.  You just fucking dismissed these people.  We got time for one more, I think, David.  One more.  One more.  Pick the best one.  What's the matter?  You're not feeling...  Okay, we got another person.  We have Vern from Philly.  Oh, God.  This has got to be good.  Vern from Philly.  What's Vern about?  Vern from Philly is working his way in right now up to the microphone.  Oh, this is...  That was one of my favorite shows. 
[03:23:00]  Vern and Early.  This is going great.  Wow.  Did you see that jerk?  All right, Dave, what do we got on Vern?  Well, honestly, this guy's not very interesting.  Why am I here? 
[03:23:30]  The point of why we brought him up is because he was...  We were arguing with each other, so I thought it would be interesting to share what...  Oh, what happened?  No chemistry?  You didn't hit it all?  I started talking and inquiring about him, and we were like, what do you do for a living?  Have you had any interesting stories?  No, no, no.  And we're talking, and all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he just says, what's wrong with  the shirt?  What's with the shirt you're wearing?  It looks like it's from 1994.  Oh, snap.  Oh, snap.  Out of nowhere, out of nowhere.  Out of nowhere.  We were just having an Instagram at the Comic Con Station.  Out of nowhere.  He doesn't want to insult my shirt.  So what do you want to say to him?  Look him in the eye.  And then I proceeded to insult his shirt back. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, no.  What did you say about his shirt?  And he got me back.  Why?  What did you say about his shirt?  He said to me, he said to me...  What's wrong with the back of his shirt?  He said to me, what's with your shirt?  Is it from...  It looks like your shirt's from 1995.  I wore your shirt in 1994.  And I proceeded to say to him, oh, you think your shirt's any better?  No!  Oh, no, no!  That's crazy.  Holy shit.  The barbs that were traded out there.  Yeah, definitely.  How did we not see a fight start?  I don't know what came about it.  I was just asking, what do you do for a living?  What's going on in your life?  Any interesting stories?  Oh, your shirt sucks.  No!  Damn. 
[03:24:30]  Damn.  So what'd you do?  I insulted his shirt, then I proceeded to insult his shoes also.  No!  What's wrong with his shoes?  No!  What's wrong with his shoes, David?  What'd you say about his shoes?  I said, where'd you get those shoes?  Did you get them at Payless?  Oh!  God damn it.  That's fucking ruthless now, David.  David, there's a line that you don't understand when to cross it.  You don't fucking insult somebody to that extent until they throw something bad at you.  Payless.  Oh, my God, David.  But it's out of nowhere.  We're just having a nice conversation. 
[03:25:00]  He insults my shirt out of nowhere.  Wow, you're like dropping A-bombs on the motherfucker.  I thought we should bring this guy in and...  So why don't you try to get along with him?  Why don't you do a little, uh...  I think we should inquire about why he was so upset with my shirt and why you...  No, why don't you just try to get along?  Should we inquire?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't think this guy likes me very much.  He's from Philly.  I like him.  He's from Philly.  Find out more about Vern.  Go ahead, David.  Try again.  I don't know if I can do it.  He's...  There's something about me that he doesn't...  I like you, David.  Yeah, what's wrong with this?  You're no problem with this.  If you don't like me, why did you insult my shirt?  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:25:30]  I just asked where you got the shirt.  Did you mention...  No, that's not true.  That is not true.  He said, what's with that shirt?  I wore that shirt in 1994.  That's not the answer.  Maybe he did.  It does kind of almost look like a Kurt Cobain-ish kind of grunge type shirt.  Exactly.  Without the brains to blow out.  Did you...  David, do you think that he insulted your shirt because you commented that he has a...  Oh, boy.  I can't remember the movie.  I'm tired, man. 
[03:26:00]  I'm scared.  Oh, I know what I was going to say.  Go ahead.  Why did he insult you?  I don't know why he insulted me.  That's what we're trying to find out right now.  Okay.  Wow, that's what we're trying to find out.  He said he likes you.  Yeah, he said he likes you.  If he likes me, why would he insult me?  Did you ask if you could also try on Liam Neeson's wig from Taken?  No, I didn't.  No.  No, I didn't.  I haven't seen that movie yet, so I don't know.  That's all right.  You didn't need it to hear that joke, Bob. 
[03:26:30]  Thanks, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  So you're all right.  Taken.  The humor from the room.  I really have.  It was Taken.  I'm like the ShamWow with fucking humor.  The Shamboo.  The ShamDud.  Yuck.  All right.  So anyways, what do you do again?  I didn't really remember anything about you because you insulted me.  But we try to get along.  What do you do in Philly?  I'm an engineer. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, that's right.  What kind of engineer are you?  Mechanical.  What company do you work for?  What do you do?  I don't want to say my company over here.  Because I don't say that, but what do you do for, like, elaborate?  We design furnaces for steel mills.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  That's a big job there.  You don't need a head on your shoulders for that there, David.  Yes, sir.  Yes.  You make a mistake, and then that fucking big thing pours out that molten metal all over  the floor instead of where it's supposed to go.  It's probably a big time right now for you guys, because it's the winter, and a lot  of furnaces have been used in the wintertime, right? 
[03:27:30]  No, it's furnaces.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He didn't just say that.  What's the guy do?  I didn't even hear it.  No?  No.  He makes furnaces for the steel industry.  Well, I know for the steel mills.  I know that, but for steel, I understand that part.  You understand that?  So now, with the cold weather, people need furnaces.  No, the steel mill needs furnaces in the winter.  Why?  It's cold.  Do you understand that they're not using it for warmth in the place? 
[03:28:00]  They're using it to melt fucking steel?  Right.  Yeah, I understand that.  No, you didn't.  I understand that.  No, you didn't.  Don't say you did.  You didn't understand it.  You understood that, right?  Yeah.  No, you didn't.  You said it was to keep warm, but it's to melt steel.  He really did understand.  No, he didn't.  No, he did.  Did you mean that, or you knew what it was, right?  No.  He just fucks it up in a single way.  He falls under questioning. 
[03:28:30]  We had a nice little bit going, and fuck.  He just falls.  That's right.  No.  All right.  No, I didn't.  I thought it was to keep warm.  Hey, something else came to my attention the other day.  He's not a big fan of Obama, right?  No, he's not a fan of Obama whatsoever.  I say that because Obama's on every TV right now.  He's doing a little live press conference.  He's not a fan?  No, he hates Obama.  Why do you hate Obama, David?  It's not the obvious.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I didn't like Obama.  I didn't like McCain either, honestly.  I didn't like either of him.  Well, we're not asking about that.  We're asking about the President of the United States. 
[03:29:00]  And it doesn't matter about McCain because he's not, yeah.  Yeah.  So why don't you like Obama?  What's your problem with him?  I don't know.  He just seems very, like, unbelievable and very phony-like.  Like, he always talks about all this change that he's going to bring to the world.  And he says, like, he's going to, like, somehow rescue the economy and bring all this money.  I don't know.  Where the heck is he going to get all this money from that he promises everyone?  How is he going to change the world with this change?  I'm very confused with this man.  God.  Ann's got a playmate. 
[03:29:30]  You might have to start right now with this guy.  There's President George Bush.  He didn't do any change.  Do you think this guy can do any better?  Where is this change going to come from?  Where's this money and all this, like, change the world, change everything with the war in Iraq?  Oh, a better country, a better everything.  I don't know.  I don't believe this guy.  You think he's full of shit?  I do think so.  The Jews don't like him, right?  I don't know about that.  He's a little too touchy-feely with the Muslims and, you know, the people that are against the Jews.  That's true, too.  That's another reason why I don't.  The Jews.  That's true, too.  And also, I didn't like him about the church that he preached at back in the day. 
[03:30:00]  That he preached at?  Yeah.  Well, he didn't preach there.  He just went there.  The church that he preached at?  Well, he was the pastor.  His church was...  The pastor.  Okay.  The pastor.  Yeah.  And he was a part of that church.  So that didn't...  Yeah.  That doesn't look good for...  But I think he's a phony.  Yeah?  He's phony.  I believe so.  Well, okay.  Well, he's the president.  He's just trying to help people out.  What do you think?  I know he's trying to help people out, but I don't see where all this change is going  to come from.  Where can he...  Where is he going to come up with all this money to rescue America?  Where the heck is he going to come up with that? 
[03:30:30]  I don't know.  Good idea.  Print more up.  Why don't they just print a bunch of money and give it out?  He's just going to print it?  Where is it going to come from?  From the Treasury.  They get paper, some ink, you print a bunch of money, and then you mail it out to people.  Why can't you do that?  I don't know.  And if you don't like Obama and you don't like McCain, who should have been president?  I didn't vote for president.  No, I understand that, but who would you like in there, or what type of guy would you like  in there, in the White House?  I don't know who I want.  I just want someone that would be, like, more... 
[03:31:00]  I don't know, like, take more control over everything and have, like, a set goal and  a set plan and know what they're actually doing.  That's what we'd like in an intern, too.  Like, President Bush was so...  Like, President Bush was no good.  He didn't know what he was doing.  He was so confused with his weapons of mass destruction and something.  Well, they found them, though.  They found them.  No, they didn't.  Okay.  They didn't find them.  Where did they find them?  That was the whole point, that he thought they were weapons of mass destruction and there  were nothing.  He was wrong.  He wasn't wrong.  They found them in, uh, the, uh... 
[03:31:30]  Where did they find those weapons?  Right.  They didn't find them.  Yeah, they were over there somewhere.  They were in Maranek?  Oh, okay.  Jesus.  All right, who do we got next?  Anything?  Can we finish up with one more of your, uh...  You're up or what?  It's up to David at this point.  David?  He's shuffling through his, uh...  We don't really have any more good people, to be honest.  No?  Sam?  Well, I mean, if you want to talk to the woman that he said was the most boring, we could  talk to...  Bring her in.  All right.  Yeah, let's bring... 
[03:32:00]  Come on in.  Yes.  Oh, please.  Uh, David said that Dana from Philadelphia was the most boring person he talked to.  Work your way in here.  It seems to me that there's a lot of people here from Philly today.  Yeah, that's cool.  We like, uh, Philly.  Yeah.  A lot of Philly people.  There you go.  Philly's actually being...  All right, it's Dana.  Hi, Dana.  Hi, Dana.  How are you?  Awesome.  Cool.  Awesome.  You're in here because David said that you're the most boring person on the page.  I'm a little hungover and a little tired.  Yeah, that's all right.  She's hungover and tired.  One fist away from the mic, please.  Oh.  Yeah, that's David's rules. 
[03:32:30]  Is that better?  That's David's rules.  We don't know.  We live by his rules.  He was taught by professionals, so we don't know shit.  Really?  Because we've just been doing radio for years and, you know, double that.  And that's how long Opie's been doing radio, but, eh, whatever.  David, uh, you said she's boring.  Yeah.  Exceptionally so.  She's Dana.  She's from Philly, though.  Pretty much all I got out of her was that she's a medical, she's a medical biller.  Uh-huh.  Examiner.  Okay.  And she...  Wow, that was kind of a dismissal. 
[03:33:00]  Dismissive, okay.  Okay, she's not a...  She's a medical examiner, if you want to be precise.  I think...  Yeah.  And I kept on inquiring, like, what did she do?  Like, any interesting stories?  I'm saying, no, no, no, she had nothing to really say.  How did you inquire?  How did you inquire?  That's what I want to know.  Question her, not like a fucking interrogation, but as she is somebody you are interviewing  for a radio show. 
[03:33:30]  Go ahead.  Just throw some questions at her and try to get something out of her.  Well, I got a couple of, like, a little bit out of her.  Like, I inquired about, like, what she was doing last night.  All right.  Why don't you, um...  Why don't you recreate that special moment that happened outside right here in our studios?  Okay.  What did you do?  What did you do last night?  He just asked that.  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  Okay.  Well, um, I drank, uh, excessively. 
[03:34:00]  Nice.  And, uh, played pool.  All right.  You're okay.  Yeah, and I appreciate that you bring up drag racing, because my family did that.  Really?  I used to race, too.  You did?  You raced...  They're a little junior dragster, a little Briggs & Stratton motor.  We got a little...  Injected alcohol.  Did you also fly planes in the 1920s?  Dunn, Garlitz.  No, but the one that flew, it was Vern that was just in here.  Oh, yeah.  How fast did you go?  Oh, those things only go, like, maybe 65.  You were, like, 10 years old.  It's impressive when you're a young kid. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, my 10-year-old.  A 10-year-old going 65 miles an hour.  Who was your dad, Dunn, Garlitz?  No.  Big Daddy, Dunn, Garlitz?  How fast has your dad...  It's a drag racing joke, Jimmy.  I think he's done about 150.  It was a nostalgia funny car.  Oh.  See, we're getting a lot out of it, David.  See, it's drag racing.  Now, David, drag racing.  They're not going to teach you in the Connecticut School of Broadcasting, but she said she drank  a lot and played pool, so now work off that.  There's more than just the pool.  She didn't just play pool.  She's in a pool league.  All right.  Work off that.  Now work off that. 
[03:35:00]  Wow.  Now develop your interview.  Work off that.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  So, so what type of a league is this?  It's a pool league.  I know it's a pool league, you know what I mean?  I know you didn't.  I know you didn't.  I'm trying to get out of it, like, what...  Holy shit.  I'm trying to get out of it, like, what's the format of the league and, like, the people  that are in the league.  I want to know about that.  Fucking gold.  The guy's fucking gold.  I want to know about, like, the people in the league and stuff like that. 
[03:35:30]  Well, all right, well, all right, okay, we wanted to...  Take two.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Let her out.  Let her out.  Okay.  Develop the pool league.  Go ahead.  So, you're in a pool league, I understand.  How many people are in this league?  Uh, you can have up to eight.  Eight?  Well, eight per team, and then the league is about...  Most interesting thing ever.  Ten different pools.  Eight?  I thought it'd be seven or nine.  Is it competitive?  Like, is it competitive?  How competitive is this league?  Like, do you play for, like, money, or do you, like, play for certain, like, what  what goes on?  Do you play to be...  To get drunk?  No.  No.  No.  You can go to, like, any big event, and they'll pay you, just like Las Vegas. 
[03:36:00]  They'll fly you down there if you're good enough, your whole team.  Well, like a regular professional league pool?  Sort of, yeah.  Oh, okay.  How did you get so good at pool?  Um...  First of all, are you any good at pool?  Like, where do you rank in this league?  Like, how good is your team?  I'm a, uh, two.  Two?  What does that mean?  Like, is that good?  Well, I'm just starting off, and for a woman, it's fine.  What's the highest you can go?  Uh, eight. 
[03:36:30]  Okay.  I think.  Who's an eight?  It's the Black Widow.  That Asian chick, yeah.  Yeah, they're up there.  What's her name, Black Widow?  She's fucking pretty intense when you watch her ESPN 20.  It don't matter.  Fuck it.  Go ahead, David.  Work your interview.  Come on, David.  So, like, how does the league work?  Like, is there a certain, like, amount of people on a team?  You knock balls in pockets.  I understand that, but is there, like, certain people on a team?  Eight players total, but only five can play per night.  And then whoever wins, you know... 
[03:37:00]  Bar league?  Yeah.  Sorry.  Just wanted to add that in.  It was some kind of a, you know, you had to go somewhere special.  Yes, Hans is drinking.  Or it's like darts.  Yeah, yeah, I understand.  But believe me, even if it's not in a bar, I'd be drinking.  Hear, hear.  So, uh, you think you see yourself, like, getting more, like, developing a career out of pool?  Like, becoming, like, a professional billiards player?  Or, like...  No.  He doesn't know how to turn and take the pool thing and then go somewhere else.  Dave, work off what you got. 
[03:37:30]  And think about what the listeners want.  That's all that I got.  But just because she started with the pool thing doesn't mean you gotta make the whole  thing about pool.  Right.  Like, like, alright, you got it.  Now she plays pool.  She plays in a bar.  Uh, uh, she drank last night.  Like, there's a few areas you can touch on there.  She looks like a chick that likes going and having a good time partying a little bit.  You know, stuff like that.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, like, like, fucking do something.  No. 
[03:38:00]  No, she would just deny it.  Sam just did something and he goes, no.  No.  No.  Sam just suggested something and he goes, no.  Oh, Sam's his handler.  What were you suggesting there?  There are questions that he had written that now he doesn't want to ask them.  I didn't write those questions.  David, they're on your index cards.  You wrote them.  I don't want to ask those questions.  Ask the questions.  Just read the card that you wrote.  Oh, God.  You tapped me again.  He jumps out of his fucking skin.  I don't want to ask that.  It's your handwriting, David.  Just read the card.  I don't want to ask that.  All right.  You might as well ask it because this interview is going nowhere.  Yeah, just ask it. 
[03:38:30]  It's going nowhere.  You're bombing.  You got to fucking pull out the heavy guns.  Yeah.  Ask the question.  Go with the desk and stuff.  No, I was just like...  Ask the question.  You're bombing.  You're fucking losing our audience.  Let's go, David.  Ask it.  How many miles of dicks have been in you?  Ask the question.  Ask the question.  You wonder why I don't ask that question. 
[03:39:00]  Holy shit.  I told you I didn't want to ask.  Yeah.  Because he got a really bad reaction.  You're right.  I'm with David.  That shouldn't have been asked.  You're right, David.  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  You hate.  See, when the audience makes that guffaw noise, it's a horrible thing.  Yeah.  You're right.  I'm with you, David.  No comment.  There you go.  And ask her if the road was multicolored.  All right.  Here's another question for David.  Oh, I can't ask that. 
[03:39:30]  David, you just asked the last one.  Ask it.  Ask the question.  What's wrong with you?  You just got a foothold with the crowd.  They're with you.  Now ask the question.  You going to go back to fucking pool questions?  No.  Ask the question.  Come on, for fuck's sake.  Buck up.  Do the show.  We're teaching you.  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  Right.  I heard that.  Very good.  Go ahead, David.  Ask the question.  Okay.  This is the question.  If you had to guess the amount of cum that you've ingested in your lifetime, how much  would you say you've had?  Right? 
[03:40:00]  That's the question that I'm...  You know, you get a young lady in here, and now you fucking insult her like that.  It's not my thing.  It's not my thing.  It's not my thing.  Whatever.  You ask the fucking question.  You got to have some kind of discretion when you're asking people stuff.  There's a young lady in here.  I don't want to ask those questions.  And you're asking, whatever, you did.  You should have stuck to your fucking guns and not asked it, is what we're saying.  I should have gone back to the pool.  We're trying to teach you.  No fucking pool.  We're trying to, like, teach you something here.  No matter how much someone asks you to do something, you got to use your own common  sense.  There's a nice young lady, and you ask her that horrible fucking question. 
[03:40:30]  What?  It's terrible.  It's being put in my face.  Now, what's that?  All right.  So just ask her this one.  All right.  One more question.  Wait.  One more question.  It's one more question.  Just one more, and then we can wrap up this.  You're bombing.  Ask her the fucking question.  Why do you keep throwing the questions?  Don't throw the cards at Danny.  I'm not asking that question.  Do you want to be executive intern?  Yes.  Then ask the fucking question.  I'm not asking that question.  I swear to God, you'll be out the fucking door if you don't ask the fucking question.  I'm not even kidding you.  You think he's kidding?  Look at his face.  I don't fucking jump on people, but I'm jumping on you.  You don't ask the question, you're fucking out the door.  We'll get another executive intern. 
[03:41:00]  Ask the fucking question.  All right.  And wait.  Don't read the fucking question.  Look her in the eye.  And ask the fucking question.  I want this to be believable.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  On mic, motherfucker.  Come on.  I can't do it.  Do it.  We just went through this.  Come on.  Fucking.  Look at the time.  Paul's waiting in the wings to become executive intern.  And we'll make that fucking move now.  He's good.  Believe me.  I wouldn't hesitate to ask that question, David.  I don't fuck around.  Am I ever like this?  I'm a fun guy and you got me pissed. 
[03:41:30]  Okay.  Come on.  Ask the fucking question.  Fine.  Look her in the eye.  Don't read it.  Have you ever eaten a pussy or had yours eaten by another woman?  Jesus Christ.  No.  You learned nothing.  Why did you ask it?  I told you to stick to your fucking guns.  I asked it because you said...  Holy shit.  But stick to your guns.  You didn't want to read the question.  That's what you do.  You don't read it.  And then you were not going to...  Yeah, but I don't fucking...  What am I...  I'm not going to fire you.  You fucking folded.  You just said you were going to...  Stick to your guns. 
[03:42:00]  That's the most important thing in this business.  You just said you were going to...  You don't fucking kowtow to me.  You don't answer...  You don't ask a question like that.  He was giving you a lesson.  The fucking lady...  I just told you don't ask questions like that.  You told me you were firing me.  No matter what.  He was getting...  He was testing you.  That was to get you going.  He was testing you.  You said you were going to fire me.  Oh my God.  You are the most confused motherfucker.  He said you were going to fire me if you didn't.  Yeah, but that was a way to make you ask it when you went against your fucking better judgment.  Yep.  She's a nice young lady and he asks these horrific fucking questions.  What am I supposed to do in that situation? 
[03:42:30]  What if you...  It's the Kobayashi Maru.  Mm-hmm.  Douchebag.  What am I supposed to do?  I mean, you're supposed to...  What am I supposed to do in that situation?  I'm supposed to either ask the question or go or get fired.  David, you want to give out your Facebook for the people out there?  They're all dying to...  What am I supposed to do in that situation?  Exactly.  It's really a...  Test the character more than a...  It is.  There's no right or wrong.  It's either I don't ask the question and be polite and not ask rude questions like that  or I go against your wishes and get fired.  That's the quandary, isn't it?  Test the character.  Yeah. 
[03:43:00]  No right or wrong answer.  I won't do.  I don't want to get fired.  Except David was panicking yesterday and leaving messages on my Facebook page because a hundred  people had added him after I mentioned yesterday on the air that he had Facebook.  Oh, no.  And he didn't know who any of them were.  So he had to verify each one with you.  Well, then I started getting messages from other people who are fans of the show saying  that David messaged them saying, I don't know who you are.  Who are you?  Why did you add me?  By the way, it's not going to help that they just put his Facebook name on the pad data. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, wow.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Wow.  You're going to get quite a few friend requests, David.  And comments.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, David.  Let's wrap this up nice now.  Yeah.  We've got one more question.  If you don't have a question, then read the question Sam's got.  Yeah.  We've got to wrap it up.  One more.  What are you throwing it for?  I'm not asking that question.  One more.  I'm not even going to get mad.  I'm not going to yell.  But we've got one more.  We've got time for one more.  Just read the question and we're out of here.  I'm not reading that question.  That's all we've got to do.  Let me see the Sam's question. 
[03:44:00]  Look.  Read Sam's question.  It's probably not even that bad.  It's pretty bad.  After the other three.  It's not my question.  I took it off of David.  David has a question on index.  All right.  So I just grabbed one.  No, it's pretty bad.  I'm not asking that.  One more.  David, that's the good one.  Trust me.  One more.  Let's do it.  I've got to go.  It's a pretty bad question.  Just ask and we'll go.  I won't get on you.  I already.  It's the same type of question as all the others.  Listen to me for a second.  I already told you that what I did for you was like a test. 
[03:44:30]  And it's a test of character.  Now listen to me.  Don't talk.  Don't talk.  There's no right or wrong answer.  Whether you asked her or not, it wasn't a right or wrong.  It was a test of character.  So I saw what you had done.  It wasn't a bad thing.  I'm kidding.  She has a good sense of humor.  She could take questions like that.  She was laughing and everything.  She's nodding her head.  So don't feel bad about it.  Let's ask the one question.  We'll all get out of here smiling and happy.  The audience loves it.  Just finish up with this question. 
[03:45:00]  It is fine.  Let's go.  He does make a good point, this Anthony.  Let her rip.  Look her in the eye.  Let her rip.  This will be the final one.  Come on.  Okay.  We'll finish strong.  Okay.  I don't know.  Should I?  I don't know.  Just ask her.  It's okay.  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, you should have pushed her.  It's fine.  She's got a good sense of humor.  Jimmy was just fucking rude.  He's just a bad one.  Yeah, that's fine.  I took the bad one away.  Yeah, Jimmy took the bad one away from you.  Just do that.  We'll leave.  This is pretty bad, too.  It's 11-17.  Jimmy took the bad one away.  I gotta go.  Showing a little responsibility.  You know, go ahead.  I gotta go. 
[03:45:30]  What's the most dicks you would stick in your fart box?  Holy shit.  I can't believe you fucking did it again.  Dude, just because I changed my tone with you doesn't mean you fucking read the question  like that again.  You are an idiot.  You're a puppet.  You're a puppet.  Because you're not supposed to read it.  It's a rude fucking question to the girl.  You failed again.  You failed again.  Look how nice she is.  Not read it.  You're supposed to not read it.  And you're going to keep on telling me to read it.  No, I might. 
[03:46:00]  But you don't fucking read it.  Hold on.  You know.  Oh, go ahead.  Now, this question was rude.  Now, this is the question that you don't ask.  Now, read this question, but tell her that this is the question they wanted you to ask.  Right.  Like, ask it to her, but she knows that you're not really saying it.  Yeah.  This is the question that they wanted me to ask you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I'm not.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  If you had to compare your.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  If you had to compare your clit size to everyday household items, what would you compare yours to?  Oh, my God.  That's the one that we're.  That's that one.  That's that one. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, he's asked her.  All right, let's see.  I didn't ask her.  Another rude question to our guest.  David, why don't we do this?  Why don't you apologize to her?  She's been very nice.  I know.  A good sport.  And apologize for all the wrong, all the wrong things we did here.  Yeah, because David, I mean, you really have been.  I want a sincere apology.  You've been rude.  You haven't stuck to your guns.  You've just been awful.  Go ahead, David.  Apologize to her.  Trust me.  I just want to say I'm sorry for asking you those questions.  I apologize.  David, what questions, really? 
[03:47:00]  All the questions that I just asked.  Which ones?  I don't remember.  All four of them.  No, which ones?  Here's one of them.  What's down there?  What's down there?  No, I'm not asking that.  What is it?  No, you don't have to ask that.  I'm not saying that.  What?  No.  What?  If somebody, who?  What the fuck now?  You've gone too far?  I'm not asking that question.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's different than Sam.  Why is that different than Sam?  Because it's material from Jimmy.  Because one, two, three.  That's right. 
[03:47:30]  That's what you're talking.  The holy fucking trinity.  It's not a question.  It's the holy trinity.  I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying it's Steve-Man.  Who did I say was bigger than Steve?  I said you could make fun of Steve because who liked you?  Nobody that works here.  Oh, I think it's a dumber.  Oh.  I'm kidding.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Read.  Yeah.  Just do that.  I'm not reading it.  It's from Jim Norton.  I know it's from Jim Norton.  It's not polite.  It's even worse.  It's even ruder than the other things that I just asked.  You owe her an apology.  What's wrong with that?  I told her.  I'm very sorry.  That's not sincere.  I'm very sorry for the questions that I asked you. 
[03:48:00]  If Jim Norton handed me something.  You're a very nice woman.  I didn't mean to do that.  I apologize.  Do what?  Ask me all those questions.  All right.  You want to play games?  Here we go.  All right.  They ask you all those questions.  I'm sorry about that.  Are you going to read the one that Jimmy gave you?  No, I'm not going to read it.  It's not polite.  That means you're going to have to read this one instead.  I just learned my lesson.  I just learned my lesson.  I asked him those four questions that I shouldn't have.  I learned my lesson.  Test the character.  Wait.  What were the four questions you asked her again?  I forgot.  There's this one.  Yeah.  There's this one.  No.  No, we're doing radio.  You can't just show me.  I read them already.  I'm not reading them anymore.  I feel that I tried to help him amend things and he would not do it. 
[03:48:30]  So now I love you, but you have to be punished.  That's please.  Please.  There you go.  Read it.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  David, you said you have to.  Why do I have to?  What if I want to?  That's the main guy.  Well, then, you know, have fun.  It's different.  I'm not even going to say anything.  That's fucking Jimmy Norton, though.  That's Jimmy fucking Norton.  What if I don't do it?  You should do it.  I'm not going to do it.  You'll be demoted from executive intern.  Okay, fine.  You don't want that.  I do want that.  That's a resume stuffer.  I want that because I learned my lesson, not to ask those questions or say anything. 
[03:49:00]  You're not going to be an intern.  You're not going to be.  David, trust me.  They escorted Earl out of here the other day.  It's not me.  This is Jimmy.  I wouldn't see you.  This is Jimmy.  Look, I'm out of it.  I won't get you in trouble.  I'm backing up.  I'm backing up.  I learned my lesson.  I learned my lesson.  I'm not going to deal with it.  David, I'm a fan.  I wouldn't get you in trouble.  I like you.  I like you on the air.  It's Jimmy, not me.  It has nothing to do with who it is.  The point is that I learned my lesson.  So I just can't.  Can we get Master Joe in here to escort David off the premises?  Okay.  I learned the lesson. 
[03:49:30]  I'm not going to ask the questions.  That's not a question.  I'm not going to ask questions or say statements anymore that are offensive.  I just learned a lesson not to go by any of these people.  Well, it's a compliment, actually.  That's not a compliment.  It certainly is.  How?  Just trust me.  I'm not saying anything.  Yeah.  Jimmy asked you, so I'm out of it.  I'm asking you.  I take responsibility.  Now it's a whole other ball game.  We're a whole new ball game with Jimmy.  We just had the, uh, we just had the, uh, where's your, where's your, David?  I'll trust you.  I'll take responsibility.  We've got to show you the door.  Whole new ball game with Jimmy.  All right.  You don't want to go.  I do. 
[03:50:00]  You don't want to go.  I do.  Over that, yeah.  We just, we just, I just learned my lesson not to say those types of things anymore.  Comments, questions that are rude like that.  Why?  Because they're offensive.  It's rude to say those things to people.  I'm not offended.  That's because it's not towards you.  Ask the audience if they're offended.  They're the.  Why don't you read that to the audience and tell them that's what I wanted you to say  to her and they'll give you a judgment.  Why don't you ask them?  And if it's too rude, then you don't have to say it to them.  Jimmy makes a good point.  Read the question.  Well, preface it.  It's not a question.  It's a statement.  Exactly.  Preface it.  Go, hey audience, would this be considered rude and then, yes, and then read that.  And she's going to hear it. 
[03:50:30]  So what?  She's an adult.  She's there.  That's a good, it's a bad little compliment.  You're too sensitive.  You're talking to the audience.  You're overly sensitive to this stuff.  I learned my lesson.  No, you didn't.  You didn't.  I did learn the lesson.  Yes, I did.  You didn't.  David, the audience is a good barometer.  I learned the lesson because I listened to you guys.  Listen to me.  You're going to learn something here.  You go, hey audience, would this be considered rude and inappropriate and then read it.  That's all.  Yeah.  You're asking the audience.  See, in that way, you're protecting yourself.  Right.  Right.  All right.  To the audience. 
[03:51:00]  Ask them.  Or you can say, Sam.  I don't even think so.  Go ahead.  Ask them.  Okay.  It's not a...  Okay.  Right.  No, preface it by talking to the audience.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Hey, guys, or whatever.  Hey, guys.  Hey, guys.  Would this statement be rude if I said this statement to her?  Would this be rude?  Okay.  All right.  I want you guys' honest opinion.  Would it be rude?  All right.  I was told to say, in order to apologize to her and make nice with her, of all the rude things  that I would say, would it be rude if I said to her, nice scarf, cunt face? 
[03:51:30]  Would that be rude?  Would that be rude?  Holy shit.  Again, he buckles.  What do you guys say?  Again, he folds.  What do you guys say?  He folded again.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You stuck to your guns.  You took your headphones off.  You did everything you should have done besides leave.  Oh, my God.  You should have fucking left instead of said something like that.  Cunt face?  That's terrible.  That is terrible.  I agree.  Yeah, well, you said it.  I have an apology written for you on the back.  You should at least use the apology real quick. 
[03:52:00]  What's the matter?  We're not professional enough?  Apology.  Make nice.  Yeah, read the apology.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I shouldn't do it.  Read the apology.  Go ahead.  That's even ruder.  No, it's not.  It's apology.  Too quickly.  I'm serious now.  It's getting late.  I want to get out of here.  Come on.  Come on.  It's Friday.  Read the fucking thing.  Come on.  Quick apology.  David, don't be a pussy.  Read the goddamn thing.  You're being a pussy.  Trust me.  I should walk out.  You don't want to walk out. 
[03:52:30]  You don't want to walk out.  You're part of the show.  Yeah, you're on air.  You know what?  The last thing you do is walk out.  You don't want to walk out.  You walk out.  They won't let you back out.  Look, Earl walked out.  Look what happened.  It's fine.  All right?  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Quick apology.  Read the apology, and then we go home.  Read the apology.  Bam.  We hit the button, and we're out.  I'm not reading it.  We got to go.  I don't care.  How come we want to apologize to you?  That's kind of rude.  David, let me read it first.  I'll make sure it's okay.  It's not bad.  You already said our scarf.  Yeah. 
[03:53:00]  Cunt face.  David, that's easy.  You know, that's not fair.  That's nothing.  Oh, God.  That's nothing.  That is literally nothing.  Come on.  You don't want to be escorted out.  Dr. Phil is here.  You don't want to be escorted out.  David.  I do want to go.  No, David.  You don't want to be escorted out.  Come on, now.  Yes, I do.  No, you don't.  You're learning a lot about radio today.  David, this is a learning process for you, and you're doing very well.  No.  You've got to learn how to.  David, you've got to stay on the air. 
[03:53:30]  You're not learning.  You don't want to stay on the air.  You are learning the opposite of what we're trying to teach you.  This is bizarre.  No, no, no.  You just told me not to say those things.  No.  Hold on.  I've got an idea, guys.  What if she said it's okay for you to read that final one?  That's good.  That's only fair.  I really don't care.  She doesn't care, David.  Jesus, if that doesn't make it easy.  If she doesn't care, then okay.  Then it's fine.  All right.  Sure.  If she doesn't care, then okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Fine.  Go ahead.  Apologize.  All right.  I'm sorry, whore. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, Jesus.  You were going to leave, too.  You're fucking despicable.  Get the fuck out of the studio.  Get out of the studio.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out.  I'm sorry.  Get out.  Leave.  Get out.  Boo.  There goes the executive intern, David.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  He's going to have a fucking nervous breakdown.  Three o'clock in the morning, he'll be sitting there just talking to a lamp in the dark.  They told me to say it.  Should I have said it?  I don't know.  All right. 
[03:54:30]  I hope you guys had fun, man.  Thanks for showing up today.  We've got to get the fuck out of here.  Start our weekend.  Weekend.  Right now.  Thank you, guys, for coming.  David's Mental Abuse was brought to you by DirecTV.  Call 888-961-DIREC-TV.  That's 888-961-DIREC-TV.  And I want to thank the cute little girl from Philly for being a good sport.  Thank you to you.  Thank you to the nurse.  Thanks to the crippled pasta guy from Canada.  Right.  Thanks to the fucking Verizon tech who knows nothing about cell phones. 
[03:55:00]  And thanks to the fucking sociopath in the back with the odd hair and the fucking wider neck than his head will support.  His head is too small for his neck.  It's bothering me.  Apparently, he fucking pissed off a witch doctor.  I think we're going to have to do this again Friday.  Thank you to the guy with the sweater here who owns the limo company.  We'll do it again.  Yeah, I'm a Maranek.  Sure.  Maranek.  Heard that word way too many times.  I know.  It was great.  Anything else?  Because we're out.  We're done.  Everything good?  We're done.  Let's out.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Have a great day.
