<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Academy Awards screeners, focusing on their dislike of *Les Misérables* and *Lincoln*'s packaging.  They criticized actors like Mark Wahlberg and Ben Affleck for lack of transformation in their roles and shared a general aversion to musicals, except *The Book of Mormon*.  The conversation transitioned to Arnold Schwarzenegger's box office flop, *The Last Stand*, and the demise of Blockbuster.  Jimmy recounted missing Al Pacino in *Glengarry Glen Ross*.  A clip from the horror film *Mama* elicited strong reactions.  The hosts then launched into a critique of the Presidential Inauguration, targeting the Daily News' Newtown coverage, Reverend Al Sharpton's presence, and Richard Blanco's poem, which they dissected line by line with sarcastic commentary.  They played a clip of Arnold Schwarzenegger on Elvis Duran's show and continued their critique of the inauguration performances by Beyoncé and Kelly Clarkson, peppered with offensive remarks about their appearances and the audio quality of James Taylor’s performance.

The show continued with further harsh criticisms of President Obama, including offensive remarks about his middle name and racial slurs.  They mocked the inauguration's cost and Michelle Obama's physique, along with lengthy, derogatory comments about Prince Harry.  The deaths of Earl Weaver, Stan Musial, and the real-life inspiration for "Prop Joe" from *The Wire*, and the actor who played Omar were also mentioned.  The hosts’ critique of Obama's inaugural address continued, punctuated by more offensive language and jokes about news anchors making on-air mistakes (one confusing Bill Russell and Morgan Freeman, another using a censored word). Alicia Keys' pre-performance speech was also mocked.

A studio guest, Jason Statham, promoted his movie *Parker*. The discussion before his arrival included speculation about Alicia Keys' real name,  comments on Obama's gum chewing at the parade, and a lengthy comparison of Jennifer Hudson's before-and-after appearance since *American Idol*, including a proposed singing contest between her and Beyoncé.  A vulgar rant about the show's poor-quality pens followed.  Statham's interview covered the *Parker* plot, his cologne, stunt work (including a dangerous helicopter scene in *Crank*), his early life, his discovery by Guy Ritchie, and his thoughts on working with other action stars.  The segment ended with mentions of upcoming guests 50 Cent and Who Kid, a chaotic exchange with a crew member, and discussion of the Patriots' loss and Ray Lewis's behavior.  Advertisements for the Winter X Games and Nine-Year Mortgage were also aired.

The show featured numerous advertisements for various products and services, including debt elimination, email security, web filtering, meatballs, *Movie 43*, tax debt relief, stock trading with Jim Cramer, network security, and diamonds from Steven Singer Jewelers.  The hosts discussed a photobombing incident with Statham and extensively debated the Super Bowl, particularly Ray Lewis's behavior.  A significant portion focused on the “first annual gay off” contest, with detailed and frustrated explanations of its rules, heavily impacted by legal considerations.  The death of Orioles manager Earl Weaver was also mentioned, and a brief medical consultation with Dr. Steve addressed elbow pain.

A call to Dr. Steve about Jim Norton’s tennis elbow initiated a segment featuring crude humor and boasts of toughness.  The “gay off” contest was discussed further, introducing three new interns who were the subject of jokes about their similar appearances and E-Rock's perceived incompetence as their supervisor.  A pun-based celebrity name game followed, along with a reference to a YouTube montage of insults directed at E-Rock.  Sal's hiring and performance were criticized, including a humorous recounting of a conversation between Eric and Greg Hughes.  A promotional segment for *Movie 43* and a review of *An Officer and a Gentleman* were aired.  The “Line of the Day” segment, sponsored by Mask Sexual Flavors, was included, along with further jokes targeting E-Rock and comments about Statham and a mystery woman.  The focus returned to the "gay off" contest, with highly sexually charged discussions about Sal's potential participation, including detailed and explicit suggestions for his involvement with a male entertainer.  The interns and Troy Kwan contributed to the increasingly graphic planning.

A segment centered on the "gay off" contest, recalling a previous bizarre, silent encounter with Ian Halpern.  The discussion focused on Sal's reluctant but eventual agreement to participate in increasingly humiliating and sexually suggestive tasks to win back Opie's favor.  These tasks, discussed in graphic detail, included a Brazilian wax and acting as a "boy toy" for a male entertainer, along with other unspecified sexual acts.  The hosts joked about past sexual experiences.  A sponsorship announcement for Steven Singer Jewelers, using the humorous website address "IHateStevenSinger.com," was included.  The segment concluded with Sal's agreement to participate and the hosts' anticipation for the event.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg-audio!  Antonio!  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Oh my god, yeah.  There it is.  Good morning!  There's the ushering in of the Opie and Anthony program, huh?  Yee yee yee yee yee yee yee yee yee yee!  Wa-ga-ha-ha!  Ha, noises. Ha, noises. 
[00:00:30]  Me and Jimmy were just talking about Silver Linings Playbook.  Oh, were ye?  Yeah, I guess I'm part of the Academy, so...  The Academy?  Yeah, I'm getting For Your Considerations.  I was getting some of them, too, myself.  I said For Your Considerations because I got three movies in the mail.  Three?  And fuck the Lincoln people, man.  I ain't voting for you because you didn't send me the goddamn movie.  There you go.  I'm voting for the Academy Awards.  Which movies did you get? 
[00:01:00]  I got the Argo.  All right.  I got the Silver Linings Playbook.  And I got the Les Mis, which I...  Why did I only get Les fucking Mis?  I don't know, man.  You're gay.  What the fuck?  You're gay.  I'm gay?  Oh, okay, that explains it.  And then Lincoln.  Lincoln.  It came in a big fucking envelope.  I'm like, holy shit, I think they sent me Lincoln.  How cool is this?  And it was a really, really nice booklet with all the actors and actresses. 
[00:01:30]  What the fuck is that?  It was really nice.  And I'm like, why fucking waste the time?  Send me a stupid movie.  Why don't I get the same thing?  So guess what?  I ain't voting for Lincoln.  And I'm part of the goddamn Academy.  Les Mis, I hate it.  Like, I can't get through it.  I hate musicals.  Why would you even put it in to watch?  Because it's being, people are saying such good things about it.  I guess that's a good point.  And it's 100% musical, too.  A lot of musicals, there's that talking part, and then they break in a song and dance and whatnot.  This is all musical. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, I hate it.  Yeah, what was bad about it?  Everything.  I don't like songs.  Obviously, I mean, I don't like musicals.  But then again, Book of Mormon turned me around a little bit.  Book of Mormon ruined me.  I'll never enjoy another musical.  The opening song of Les Mis is good.  What is it?  Look down.  I don't remember.  Oh, Jimmy, sing for us.  Sing the Les Mis song.  Look down.  Look down.  Broadway Jimmy.  Look down.  Look down.  There's a cock on this woman.  Exactly.  So turn that frown upside down.  Can we find, Iraq, do we have that? 
[00:02:30]  What's it called?  Look down at the opening?  I have no idea.  Oh, my God.  I don't know the song.  Go to the Broadway fucking show.  Yeah, yeah.  Broadway.  It's probably their number one song right now.  They're playing ad nauseum.  Look up Les Miserables.  Well, of course, Sam got it way before E-Rock, even though E-Rock's got the master fucking  computer in there.  But I hate it.  Yes.  Yeah, it's the only one I kind of like.  It's so Broadway.  It's a good opening song, man.  Oh, my God.  I feel my teeth so spopping. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  I put on a scarf.  I was cleaning the house.  No, they were like a slave ship.  There was work being done.  Yeah.  I like that.  Why?  I enjoyed that.  I hate musicals.  I do, too.  I fucking hate them, man.  George Clooney singing.  I think I'm...  George Clooney is in it?  I mean, uh...  I was going to say.  Russell Crowe.  Russell Crowe.  I'm one for ten with musicals.  Yeah.  Book of Mormon was it for me.  To see fucking Wolverine and Maximus singing like faggots. 
[00:03:30]  I don't need that shit.  Oh, wait.  Was Hugh Jackman in it?  Yes.  Who was he?  He was the guy.  The other guy.  The other main guy.  I saw him for a minute, yeah.  Yes, yes, yes.  I'm getting some intel from other Academy members.  Oh, wow.  Do not say who you're voting for.  They tend to kick out people who do that.  Ah!  Ah-ha-ha.  Well, I could be mad that they didn't send the Lincoln film a real nice booklet.  Who cares?  How is that going to make me vote for your movie? 
[00:04:00]  Exactly.  Send the movie.  You've got to see it.  Send the movie!  Motherfucker.  I considered Les Mis for my consideration.  Yeah.  I considered it at the shooting range.  Oh, nice.  I popped it up on one of the fucking little clips.  I sent it out there at about 15 yards and blasted holes in it.  You're that angry at the gays, huh?  Ah, well, yeah.  No, of course not.  I'm angry that they only sent me Les Mis or Rableys and didn't send me fucking any Argo. 
[00:04:30]  I didn't get no Argo.  I've seen it, but...  I haven't seen the Argo yet.  I saw Silver Linings Playbook, though.  How was that?  It was all right.  Yeah?  It was all right.  Bradley Cooper's a pretty good actor.  He was good.  Yeah?  Yeah, because he was just that schmucky character in Hangover, and next thing you know, you're  like, fuck, this guy could act a little bit.  And he's in a real movie.  And then that broad from Hunger Games, and I didn't even know she was from Hunger Games.  Now I got to go watch the Hunger Games.  Dude, I loved Hunger Games.  Loved it.  Really?  Yeah, I thought it was great.  I still haven't seen Hunger Games, and the main broad in Silver Linings Playbook is the 
[00:05:00]  broad from Hunger Games.  Jennifer Lawrence.  She's beautiful.  Yeah, she is.  Did you like Hunger Games?  No, it was like a Twilight-type movie.  Oh, did you see it?  Yeah.  It was really good.  No, it wasn't.  Yes, it was.  How did I go see Hunger Games?  Who's got the illegal copies?  It's not on DVD.  Oh.  It's been out for a while.  Where do you get DVDs, though?  Best Buy?  Oh.  It's a very good movie.  I do have a Best Buy in my neighborhood, but you can tell they're sad.  Getting on iTunes?  The Best Buy in our neighborhood is getting sad. 
[00:05:30]  Is that?  Yeah, they got refrigerators and ovens now.  Oh, wow.  That's always a bad sign.  Maybe you're not selling as many DVDs.  And then I heard a news report that they're closing 300 blockbusters.  300 blockbusters.  Who knew that there were 300 blockbusters left?  Apparently, they're closing like 500, I heard.  There's 800 left.  There's 800 left.  And they're closing like 500 of them or something.  So why wouldn't they just close all 800 and be done with that?  I haven't even seen a blockbuster in years.  Like, where are the blockbusters? 
[00:06:00]  How many were there at one point?  18 billion.  Oh, see, I thought it was less.  Oh, Jimmy.  I kind of liked going to blockbusters.  I loved it.  It was kind of a thing.  Hey, let's go pick out a movie.  And you drive there, and you walk around endlessly.  You don't find anything.  Yeah.  And then the movies you want.  They don't have enough copies.  It was always fun.  Remember when it was just video before DVDs?  Yeah.  And like, you couldn't even find anything.  Like, new releases.  You're like, what the fuck?  And then you wind up having to get Tango in cash.  And then finally, they had a wall of the same movie.  You're like, all right.  Yeah.  This is how it should be done.  Right.  You shouldn't have two of the big movie. 
[00:06:30]  No.  And they guaranteed they'd have the new movie.  Right.  That became a guarantee.  Like, we will have the new movie.  And they always did at one point.  So they're closing 500 out of the 800 left?  Yeah.  Huh.  I always hated them, though, because they wouldn't show, like, I think, NC-17 or X.  So I always kind of fucking had a hatred for them.  Yeah, they had no adult section.  Did you like the Silver Linings playbook?  I, uh, no, I didn't love it.  It was okay.  I thought Bradley Cooper was good.  What is it up for, by the way?  Everything.  Even best movie?  Everything.  Best nominated for best movie? 
[00:07:00]  Come on.  Picture, director, screenwriter, actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actor.  It's the only best picture nomination I've seen because I just haven't seen movies in  general.  I dare you to vote for it.  I dare you to vote for it.  It's not going to see it.  I mean, it's not going to win, sorry.  Oh.  Oh.  It's not going to win.  It's not good.  It's not that good.  Now you're off the list for more screeners.  That's okay.  I'm fine with that.  It's too much pressure, anyway.  Too much pressure?  I don't feel like...  Too much pressure.  Much too much pressure.  They have too many...  They have questionnaires and shit.  Really?  I don't want to fill all that crap out.  I just want to see the movies.  I didn't think Ben Affleck should have gotten it for Argo, either, for Best Director for 
[00:07:30]  Golden Globes.  You know why?  Because he looks like Ben Affleck in the movie.  I hate that.  Mark Wahlberg is the same shit.  Who's he supposed to?  These actors, you don't think they're the guy.  Ben Affleck and Mark Wahlberg look like themselves in every fucking movie.  Are they supposed to?  Especially Mark Wahlberg.  He hasn't changed his hair in ten movies.  You don't get lost in the character.  No, how about you grow some facial hair or something.  Dye your hair.  Grow it out.  Do something different. 
[00:08:00]  Lincoln doesn't look like an oil salesman or whatever.  There you go.  That's what I mean.  Daniel Day-Lewis looks different in every fucking movie.  Mark Wahlberg absolutely doesn't.  He's got a new movie with The Rock.  He looks the same again.  Like a handsome guy who used to hang out with the funky bunch.  Right.  He looks like he should still be making ab tapes.  I almost said the hunky bunch.  The hunky bunch.  You don't understand what I'm saying?  Some of these actors look exactly the fucking same in every movie they do.  And it takes you out.  Didn't Ben Affleck have a beard in that? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  You can still see right through it.  Well, he's not a good actor, Ben Affleck.  He really is.  He's a terrible actor.  I thought he was good in that, though.  Well, he wasn't bad in it.  You know why?  He was playing Ben Affleck.  Right.  Exactly.  So Lincoln's going to win, obviously, because they didn't send the movie.  They know they're going to win.  Oh, man.  You think it's a conspiracy?  They don't send the movie?  Yeah, if they felt like they didn't have it in the bag, they would fucking be sending  out movies left and right.  Man.  Did you like De Niro in Silver Linings?  I thought he was decent.  He's all right.  But I've kind of gotten irritated with De Niro lately because he hasn't done anything. 
[00:09:00]  I was starting to go, he stinks.  But then I'm like, no, he doesn't stink.  Because when he did Raging Bull or Godfather, when he wants to do something, he's amazing.  Yeah, he was all right.  But he's just...  He wasn't great.  He was all right.  He needs a movie where he can really shine again like that.  But Chino at least tries.  Like, he's playing Paterno.  He was great as Jack Kevorkian.  Yeah, yeah.  I heard he was good in...  I heard he was good in...  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross, the play.  Oh, my God, Jimmy. 
[00:09:30]  We all know what happened.  I heard he was really good.  You fucking moron.  Tell me what happened.  I had tickets for the last performance.  And you were bragging about it a couple days ago.  Yeah, so me and Bob Kelly were going to go.  Oh.  And it was a three o'clock performance on Sunday.  Sure.  That's handy.  And because we were off Monday, so I kept thinking that it was a day off.  And I literally had a lamp delivery Monday. 
[00:10:00]  So I wasn't...  I forgot I had anything to do in the afternoon on Sunday.  Uh-huh.  And you start to think it's a night performance.  It's just weird to go to a show during the day.  Oh, my God.  I didn't oversleep.  I didn't even set the alarm till three.  Oh, boy.  I was like, I'll get up.  I went to bed at like seven.  I was on weekend comedian schedule.  I'll get up.  Eh, sure.  Eh, what's the rush?  I woke up three.  I'm like, oh, my God.  I'm still tired.  Let's go back to sleep till 3.30.  Oh.  You know why?  You don't want nothing to do.  What the fudge?  How mad were you?  Well, when I saw Bob Kelly's text, he goes, dude, what's up? 
[00:10:30]  Right.  I got up at four.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And I'm like, oh, no.  Meanwhile, it's in the middle of the show.  As you're waking up, like the show was on.  I'm like, I'll text him back in a few minutes.  Yeah.  And then on Twitter, somebody I read says, enjoy Pacino as...  Shelly.  And I went, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  So I missed the show.  The last performance of Glengarry.  And I never do stuff like that.  Never.  It's so funny that you actually set your alarm for three. 
[00:11:00]  Like, it was the furthest off from your head.  Yeah.  It always sets your alarm for three.  If I had...  I don't think I've ever done that.  Dude, if I had a Glengarry...  Glengarry.  Glengarry.  Glengarry.  Glengarry.  Glengarry.  Glengarry.  Glengarry.  Glengarry.  Glengarry.  Glengarry.  Glengarry.  I didn't sleep last night.  I just couldn't fucking...  Oh, that sucks.  Were you bummed out?  I was...  It ruined my week.  Yeah.  I was so depressed.  You're weak.  It's only been a couple days.  You're already convinced it's going to ruin your week?  It was yesterday.  It did.  No, it was Sunday.  Right.  Yeah, it bummed me out big time, man. 
[00:11:30]  I was like...  Because it was like, when do you get a chance to do that?  And one of my buddies is in the play, so...  I heard Pacino just runs out at the end.  Like, so he doesn't really...  Otto went.  Yeah.  And I thought, did you get to meet Pacino?  He goes, no.  He just kind of...  He talks to a couple people.  Oh, yeah.  Jumps into a waiting car.  It's out.  I gotta go.  See you later.  Yeah.  Puppet Boy.  Oh, wow.  No one movie did great this weekend was Arnie's new movie.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Arnie.  Arnie Schwarzenegger.  Oof.  Well, that was good, though.  He did some good press.  He was over doing Fox and Friends, which is a target demo for him.  Yeah.  Oh, Fox and Friends. 
[00:12:00]  I take...  Idiot.  ...great appreciation that his movie bombed, because we said yes to Arnie.  Yeah.  And we get the big A-listers here and there, and fucking Arnie decides not to do a show  like ours.  We speak to the male demos.  What the fuck?  And then his dumb movie comes out, and it fucking is a bomb-a-roo.  Did he do any radio at all?  No, of course not.  Why would you?  These fucking publicists are fucking idiots.  They're so stupid.  They just think TV's the way to go, and it's just not at times. 
[00:12:30]  Eesh.  The Last Stand came in 10th place.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  Embarrassing.  Holy shit.  Well, it goes up from there, usually, with movies, right?  Yeah, it's usually the way it is.  It's always a bomb-opening weekend.  Yeah, that's it.  What is it?  A soft opening?  What's a soft opening?  What beat it?  Huh?  It was actually in more...  What beat it?  Oh, my God.  The Last Stand for the record.  Lincoln almost beat it, and Lincoln's been out for three months.  It was in more theaters than any of the other movies were.  No way, really?  Live release.  And it's still...  The Habit.  The Habit beat it. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  The Django Unchained beat it.  Django, yes.  Django, of course.  The Les Mis beat it.  The Django.  Even though Les Mis is now in your mail.  Yeah.  Broken City beat it.  A haunted house.  It's not even Halloween.  No, it's one of those scary movie parody movies that the Wayans are in.  Ugh.  Yuck.  You know what Arnold's name is in the new movie?  I am Ray Owens.  Is it really?  Yeah, Ray Owens.  I'm Ray Owens. 
[00:13:30]  With that fucking accent again.  And they give him a fucking name that could be, you know, your neighbor down the street.  Ray Owens.  I'm Ray Owens.  Gangster.  Where you are.  Rad.  Silver Linings Playbook.  Oh.  Zero Dark Thirty.  And then...  What's Mama?  I don't even know what Mama is about.  That's that scary movie.  So creepy.  We had that guy in.  What?  We had the guy in that was in that movie.  I wasn't here that time.  Oh, right.  I don't think I was here.  What's Mama about?  It's a creepy movie.  Scary.  Couple of kids. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  Fair enough.  They're raised by some kind of thing.  I don't know what's...  Oh, wolf people.  Wolf people?  No, scary things.  Wolf people.  I think it's more spooky ghosty thing than wolfy people.  Right?  I don't know.  That's right.  I ain't seen it.  It looks scary, though.  It looks very scary.  It's got a lot of those weird little scenes where things move really quick.  And they twist and turn like they're not supposed to.  I saw the short that it's based on on YouTube.  Somebody sent it to me.  Oh, really?  It's so fucking scary.  Really?  I was so creeped out.  How long is it?  Three minutes?  No way. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  And it's scary.  I was watching on my laptop.  I got so freaked out.  You get it.  Okay.  I got at least...  Is it a visual?  Yeah, but Ant will freak out.  What is it about?  I hate this type of stuff.  It gets me very scared.  But we don't have a visual element for our show.  We don't?  Visual element.  We're lucky we have an audio element for our show.  We don't even have that if you go on the app.  Oh, God.  What happened with the app this time?  Oh, nothing.  I'm just saying in general.  I want to congratulate the Daily News.  Well, Stan looks...  God, that'll be bad.  ...for figuring out a way to get the Newtown kid on the front page again today. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, goody.  Congratulations.  Fucking pieces of shit.  Make sure you blame everything but yourselves.  Fucking pieces of shit.  Make sure you blame the violent video games and make sure you blame guns and make sure you  blame mental illness, all of which are viable things to talk about, but do not ever look  at how you contribute.  Meanwhile...  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  Just let me see a piece of this.  This should be very scary.  Okay.  I can't see.  All right.  Because you know what scares me.  I do.  Yes.  And this is it? 
[00:15:30]  Racial harmony.  Yes.  Yes.  Exactly.  I'm fighting.  All right.  Okay.  Now we're seeing an M.  There's an M.  Oh, they're spelling out the mama.  Mama.  Yeah.  All right.  That mic thing is in my way.  Who's he?  Yeah.  All right.  There's a kid.  Sleeping.  Sleeping.  It's the background's a little blurry.  It's porno.  It's a big deal.  This is easy.  All right.  There's something.  You can watch this.  There's something.  Who cares?  Someone walking in the room.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  That kid's coming in the room.  All right.  There's someone walking in the background. 
[00:16:00]  I don't like this.  All right.  Someone just fell down.  That's stupid.  Oh, how clumsy.  Victoria, wake up.  We got to go.  Wake up.  We have to go.  Mama's back.  Mama's back.  Mama's back.  What the?  I'm getting the heebie-jeebies.  I'm already getting the heebie-jeebies here.  I'm scared.  Why, Victoria?  I got to go.  Mama's back.  All right.  What's up, Mama?  So she's leaving the room.  She's taking a goldfish with her.  Who are these chicks, and why are they so scared? 
[00:16:30]  What?  All right.  They're walking.  Where?  I hear some sounds.  Is that Mama?  Is Mama here now?  See, Mama raised them.  Why would they say, hey, Mom, come upstairs?  What the fuck?  And why don't they just turn on the lights so it's not as scary?  Oh, my God.  Because I keep all my lights on so it's not scary in my house.  They're looking down a step.  They're making it scarier.  Just turn on the lights.  It won't be bad.  Oh, my God.  Now the screen's completely pitch black.  Yeah, that's stupid.  All right.  They're walking down the stairs.  There's two girls in a movie theater. 
[00:17:00]  Turn on the lights!  Why you ain't turn the lights on?  Turn all the lights on.  All right.  That's not scary anymore.  They're trying to open the door.  Victoria, don't look.  Victoria.  Don't look.  Come on.  Victoria.  Oh, shit.  There's somebody walking.  There's a mama.  I don't like she's all twisted.  There's a woman in the other room walking weird, wants a hug. 
[00:17:30]  And she ran at the camera.  Mama's fast.  Mama's fast.  Oh, Lily locked her out.  I don't like that at all.  Mama ran after the kids.  Oh, no.  No, no.  She came toward the kids with double speed.  I don't like this.  Double speed.  Oh, no.  No.  Mama walks weird.  Look at her. 
[00:18:00]  What the fuck?  Why does she walk so shitty?  She's got scoliosis.  Mom is gone.  Why can't you outrun that thing?  It's a twist and shit.  Oh, it's a lie.  I don't know.  It's just Lily or...  Oh, no.  Why?  Well, why would she turn into one of those?  I don't know.  I don't like that at all.  Is that the original?  Stupid.  That looked creepy.  Yeah, it was creepy.  Now they got a whole movie based on that?  I was sitting.  It was like Saturday morning or something. 
[00:18:30]  I was in the apartment alone.  I was like, let me check out this.  Oh, no.  But it was the laptop.  It was just on my lap.  It was right.  Did you scream?  I was so scared.  When that mama ran.  Mama fucking boogies.  Mama does boogie.  That twist and mess boogies.  Now, is that a foreign film or just a foreign trailer?  Like, is that just a three-minute foreign movie?  Or is that based on a whole...  It can't be number one in our country if it has subtitles.  I'll tell you right the fuck now.  The new one does not have subtitles.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  But that is a foreign...  You know what's scarier than that?  They sold it, obviously.  That's the whole movie? 
[00:19:00]  They sold it to an American company, obviously.  That's the whole movie?  That's the entire movie?  Yeah.  But is that a trailer for the real movie?  No, that's the original movie.  Oh, wow.  No, that movie that you just watched...  I know, Sam.  I just told you.  Don't fucking...  You know what's scarier than that?  Imagine a three-minute movie that's number one in the country.  Reverend Al.  Yeah, bye, guys.  It's more frightening.  I screamed.  He looks fucking...  I don't know what's going on with Reverend Al.  Every time you see him now.  Hopefully, it rhymes with main man.  That fucking vulture.  I don't understand why he's front and center at the inauguration, man. 
[00:19:30]  Was he there?  He was in the big fucking area there where Obama and everybody was.  Was he?  Yes.  He got one of the nice spots.  How is this fraud, this fucking...  Complete fucking...  They're just scared to tell him no, I guess.  I watched the whole goddamn thing yesterday.  That was some good TV.  It was some great TV.  I didn't catch one second of it.  Because you were sleeping?  I was snoozing.  That's...  I was snoozing.  His speech was good, I thought.  It was short.  No matter if you like him or hate him, it's just good fucking TV. 
[00:20:00]  I slept well into the afternoon.  To see this shit going down.  Commemorate MLK Day.  It was good.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was all right.  What did they do?  Did they have the poet?  Yeah, they had the poet.  How was the poet?  Wow, he looks scary.  They had a gay Cuban poet.  Poetry sucks.  Really?  It's terrible.  And a few people are attacking me because they said poetry sucks.  It just sucks.  It stinks.  Dickie Ricardo.  If you enjoy poems and poetry, so be it. 
[00:20:30]  But don't fucking push it on the rest of us.  Most of us eat it.  Poems stink.  I don't feel like trying to figure out what you're saying.  Yeah.  Just say it.  Yeah.  And I tweeted about it, too.  That songbirds don't exist.  Shut up.  Oh, they don't.  There's always a songbird on your fucking window.  No, that doesn't happen.  You've never seen one?  No.  Not at all.  But fucking, they love using songbirds in poems.  More likely to see a Larry Bird on your fucking show. 
[00:21:00]  The songbird sings, and this means something.  I don't know.  It's always this interpretation.  You got his whole poem?  Plum Dusk.  All right.  All right.  For all the people out there that love poetry, sit through this horse shit.  All right.  Let's see if we can interpret it.  In the poetry world, they all said that he fucking killed it.  This wasn't.  It's like you watch it, and you go, all right, I recognize it's a good poem, but it doesn't  do anything for me.  No.  What does it mean?  I don't even know what it meant.  Oh, I knew what it meant.  What did it mean?  As we go, it changes.  Oh. 
[00:21:30]  Interpret it.  It changes as it goes on, obviously.  And I'll say this.  None of this shit happens to anybody.  We all work our balls off.  We don't get to enjoy what you're talking about in poems.  No songbirds?  No.  Just fucking listen for all the shit that doesn't happen to the average person.  All right.  Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  He is gay, huh?  America, the gayest.  One today. 
[00:22:00]  One sun rose on us today, kindled over our shores, peeking over the Smokies, greeting the  faces of the Great Lakes, spreading a simple truth across the Great Plains, then charging  across the Rockies.  One light waking up rooftops, under each one a story told by our silent gesture. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know what he's saying.  He's saying that the Rockies, the Smokies, the Smokies, and all these things are getting  a little sunlight on them.  Uh-huh.  Literally or figurative sunlight?  And he's saying that the rooftops were being woken up, and there's a story under each  one.  Story?  Yeah.  Right?  Is there really, though?  Yeah, each roof has a story under it.  Oh, look, under there, there's a family of drinkers who's hating each other. 
[00:23:00]  Under here is a family of...  Exactly.  Whatever.  They're not all good stories.  Most of the stories are alarm clocks going off with someone going, fuck, I gotta go to  work!  Yeah.  Look at those Secret Service.  There's no stories.  The Secret Service are hilarious, walking around Obama when he was out of the car and  walking down the street.  They are scanning like machines.  Wow, did he just get out and walk?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  He likes to do that.  They walked the last little part.  Gerald Ford did that shit, too, until a fucking pistol came out, and it was like...  Squeaky.  He's like, oh, I guess I should just take the car. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Let me stay in the car.  Who was the first president, and maybe the only president, to walk the entire parade route?  I would say...  Washington.  Hayes.  Jimmy Carter.  Really?  Jimmy Carter.  Jimmy Carter.  He walked the whole parade route.  How long is it?  He was, I guess, the first.  Wow.  Jimmy Carter.  Well, he probably knew he wouldn't have a second shot at it.  He's like, I'm going to enjoy the view.  And Michelle Obama in that coat that they're all bragging and talking about, she looked 
[00:24:00]  like she had a bulletproof vest under there, because she was walking very tight and stiff.  Yeah, it was awful.  It's like one of the Jetsons.  No, they said it was amazing.  Oh.  They say she's a fashion icon.  Maybe Marty McFly gave her a letter or a note to tell her, you know, hey, protect  yourself.  That's right.  Remember?  He put the bulletproof vest on.  Like Clint Eastwood.  And he...  Who?  Right.  Right.  About that.  Light of fire.  Clint Eastwood.  Light of fire.  I hated Clint Eastwood in that as much as I love him. 
[00:24:30]  Light of fire.  I was rooting for Malkovich to kill him and the president.  Malkovich was great.  He was so likable, and Clint wouldn't bond with him.  That annoyed me.  When he was putting together that wooden gun under the table.  Oh, yeah.  Shit, what a scene.  Why'd you shoot that bird, asshole?  Right.  He fucking kills him.  Right.  He was great in that.  Yeah.  Fat girl from Minnesota had to die.  Choked her.  Killed the dog.  All the other dog lived.  Her and her roommate got her fucking necks broken.  It was great.  All the women are cutting and making bangs now because Michelle Obama. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, is that it?  Because she's a fashion icon.  She went with the bangs.  She went with the bangs.  Beings.  All right, back to the poem.  Stories.  What have we learned so far?  The sun's going up.  It's a lot of fucking people have to go to work.  Yeah, everyone's one.  Try to pay the bills.  Yeah.  Richard Blanco.  Moving across windows.  All right, enough of the sun.  My face.  Your face.  Come on.  Millions of faces in morning's mirrors.  Each one yawning to life. 
[00:25:30]  Crescendoing into our day.  The pencil yellow school buses.  The rhythm of traffic lights.  Fruit stands.  Apples.  That's just the case.  Wines and oranges.  Arrayed like rainbows.  Rainbows.  Rainbows.  He's implying they have a lot of colors.  Yes.  Yes.  Is he talking about diversity?  Oh, maybe.  We got more info on the Arnie thing.  Yeah.  You got the Zim underscore NYR. 
[00:26:00]  He's a Rangers fan.  Go fuck yourself.  But his tweet's good.  He writes, Arnold did the Z morning zoo.  Did he?  No, he did do radio.  And then he does Z 100.  Z morning zoo.  What a fucking dumb publicist.  Z 100 leans toward females.  Yes.  Not your target demo, you dummies.  You're doing a guy's movie.  All right.  Maybe if you don't want to do our show, fine.  I mean, supposedly it was offered to us and they turn us down.  But there's a million other fucking guy-oriented radio shows.  And then you go on Morning Zoo at Elvis Duran. 
[00:26:30]  Happy to be here.  Nothing against Elvis Duran, but he talks to females.  He talks to broads.  That is simply a dog shit publicist.  What an idiot.  Is there a clip from that?  Yeah.  And then we'll get back to the poet.  Good morning.  This is an Elvis Duran and the Morning Show online exclusive.  All right.  Well, it's been the talk of the day.  And now TJ got his way.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is here.  Schwarzenegger is really exciting.  Bring him in.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you.  Oh, my God.  Why? 
[00:27:00]  Why do you have to have that music?  With a very beautiful guest as well.  Oh, Jamie Alexander.  Jamie Alexander from The Last Stand is here.  I love her, too.  I like how they say you play the feisty Sarah.  I play the HBO music.  Of course I do.  Of course the feisty Sarah.  Good morning, Arnold.  Welcome to the show.  Well, it's great to be here.  Good to be here.  Do you ever come to New York?  I come to New York a lot.  New York.  I mean, you know, we have a foundation here that promotes after-school programs.  I come here.  I come here.  I come here.  I'm so glad he didn't come here.  I come here for my book promotions. 
[00:27:30]  I come here on vacation.  Promotions.  I come here to molest women.  I wish you'd come here.  I mean, there's so many reasons why I've come here.  I've won several of my world championship titles in bodybuilding at the Madison Square Garden here.  You ever fucking think fat made here?  Your fitness programs you're working with, obviously you're not in New York enough because  my ass is fat.  Oh, my God.  Arnold, now come on.  Now, be a polite guy.  Hey, everybody likes a little booty. 
[00:28:00]  I see it.  You got the laugh.  I've got the laugh.  I got the laugh.  I got a fat ass, and I'm proud of it, Arnold.  Wake people up with some laughs.  All right.  Get closer to that microphone if you want.  Oh, God.  Wake people up with some laughs.  Oh, my God.  It goes forever.  I was standing up over 13 minutes.  They put the entire interview up, didn't they?  Yeah.  Good for them.  Of course.  That's a coup.  But you're not getting guys.  Let's get back to something really fun.  Where were you at?  Well, he was saying.  A lot of color.  A lot of color.  A lot of diversity.  I'm trying to figure out this poem. 
[00:28:30]  Pencil.  I'm coming up for a while now.  He's saying everybody yawns in morning's mirrors.  Morning's mirrors.  Pencil yellow buses.  Fruit stands.  And he's the different colored fruits.  Getting the fruit stands.  Oranges.  Plums.  Hats.  This is a good poem.  This is supposed to be a good poem.  But it's still a poem.  Like, what's the difference between a bad poem and a good poem?  I'll tell you a bad poem.  Because this sounds bad to me.  Pencil yellow buses.  Shut up.  It's like hip hop.  Yeah.  A bad poem.  There's no good or bad hip hop.  There's just hip hop.  And there's just poems. 
[00:29:00]  You have to say it like that, too.  Poems.  No, a bad poem, he would have said, pencil green rolly machines with kids on them.  He wouldn't have said it right.  Get it.  Begging our praise.  Silver trucks heavy with oil or paper.  Bricks or milk.  Teeming over highways.  Bricks.  Alongside us.  Us.  On our way.  To clean tables. 
[00:29:30]  Read ledgers.  Or save lives.  To teach geometry.  Oh, my God.  Or ring up groceries.  We get it.  Thanks.  As my mother did.  People are waking up and living their lives.  So I could write this poem.  He's no Maya Angelou.  For all of us.  Today.  He's not even a Dr. Seuss.  No.  All of us.  All of us.  I would not eat green eggs and ham.  The same light we move through.  The same light on blackboards with lessons for the day. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, my God.  Equations to solve.  He hasn't said anything yet.  No.  This is terrible.  What atoms imagined.  The I have a dream we all keep dreaming.  Oh, I get it.  This is after, by the way, Kelly Clarkson leveled the place singing.  Yeah.  And she was great.  Beyonce was great, too.  And so was she.  Was that lip sync, Beyonce?  Because usually when they do that national anthem thing.  It wasn't?  Yeah.  You were sleeping.  Wow.  It was live?  I know.  I was sleeping.  You have no idea.  I know.  She pulled out her earpiece because she was having a problem.  I'm glad I had no idea.  It was Sasha Fierce. 
[00:30:30]  Fuck that fucking inauguration.  Wow.  She was great.  I called it something else.  Yeah, I'm sure you did.  Of course I did.  Why would you do that?  I know.  I thought Kelly Clarkson was marvelous.  Was she?  She was great, yeah.  Yeah, she fucking kicked ass.  And then Chuck Schumer went, wow.  And he got a laugh.  Oh, really?  Well, he didn't know what to say.  What was he fucking?  He was out of his element.  He got a laugh.  Was he fucking coming up with new legislation?  People chuckling at it?  All I kept thinking the whole time I'm watching this is that Obama, Clinton, and Carter were 
[00:31:00]  there.  Like, how great it would be to get three president pictures.  It's all I could think of.  Oh, Jimmy, right?  And George W. Bush doesn't want anything to do with Washington.  He had a great excuse.  His father there, the other Bush president, is pretty sick.  And they sent him home.  So his excuse was, I want to be with my dad.  But he has no desire to ever go back to Washington.  He was invited, right?  Of course he was.  He wants out of the limelight big time.  Yeah, he doesn't do anything.  He wrote that book.  Wasn't he?  Nothing.  He went to someone's funeral recently, I think. 
[00:31:30]  And you could tell how awkward he was.  He was like, he just doesn't want to be in that situation anymore.  Did you hear Alicia Hughes' song later?  Yeah, basically they want us to light Obama on fire, I guess.  What?  You guys like when they change the lyrics to songs.  Wait, why don't we just get that?  You have it.  Oh, excuse me.  I'm sorry, Sam Roberts.  By the way, a little note.  You see Fatso to the right of the poet?  I see him past Sam.  I'm sorry.  I see you, Ron. 
[00:32:00]  The only guy, when Obama was speaking and the poet was doing his thing, the only guy  you could see is half of Fatso to the right.  He lives in our neighborhood.  And he was falling asleep the entire fucking time.  Really?  What is he?  Is he a politician or is he a regular guy?  Yeah, someone would know his name.  He used to be more of a big deal a few years back.  He's not in the limelight as much.  We've seen him on the Accela when we used to have to do our Washington trips.  Oh, that's fucking...  I don't know his name offhand, but he was falling asleep.  Hank Sherbert. 
[00:32:30]  It was Hank Sherbert.  Hank Sherbert.  And he walks around our neighborhood, man.  He's like a big medicine ball with a head.  He was falling asleep.  I guess he was bored up there.  How do you fall asleep?  Back to the poem.  The poem.  ...of sorrow that won't explain the empty desks of 20 children marked absent today and forever. 
[00:33:00]  I don't think they mark them absent.  That was a good line, though.  Many prayers.  Was it?  Yeah.  Take them off the list.  One light.  That's terrible.  Breathing color into stained glass windows.  Life into the faces of bronze statues.  Warmth onto the steps of our museums and park benches as mothers watch children slide.  And uncles.  Oh, very good.  One ground.  Our ground.  Coffee ground.  Rooting us to every stop of warm. 
[00:33:30]  To a halt ground.  The show was by this poem.  No kidding.  See what I mean?  People say this guy was terrific.  What?  This sounds like a poem.  All right.  It's terrible.  What is he trying to say?  Right?  Roses are red.  Violets are blue.  Congratulations to you.  There once was a man from Nantucket.  I guess what happened to just rhyming shit?  Yeah.  I guess if you rhyme shit in poems, in the poem world, you're a hack. 
[00:34:00]  You're a bad poet.  How long has this poem been going on for?  Almost three minutes.  And so far the sun has come up.  Yeah.  This chick was sucking my cock.  We've got 22 kids that aren't going to school anymore.  They're marked absent, which is deeply depressing still.  There's no way they would call their names out.  Mary, Mary, quite contrary.  Trim that pussy.  It's so damn hairy.  Thank you.  They should have dice up there. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  You think if he had just done that, he would have been shot on sight?  Oh, probably.  Yes.  They should have cut his mic and you just see his lips and people are like, what is banana  juice?  Banana juice.  He's trying to keep it clean out of respect.  All right.  More poem.  Sewn by sweat and hands.  Hands gleaning coal or planting windmills in deserts and hilltops that keep us warm.  Hands digging trenches, routing pipes and cables.  Hands slathered in lard. 
[00:35:00]  As worn as my father's putting sugar cane so my brother and I could have books and shoes.  The dust of farms and deserts, cities and plains mingled by one wind, our breath.  This guy stinks.  Breathe.  What?  Tell him if I want to...  Hear it through the day's gorgeous din of honking cabs, buses launching down avenues, 
[00:35:30]  the symphony of footsteps, guitars and screeching subways,  the unexpected songbird.  Ah, there's your songbird.  Fucking songbird.  Squeaky playground swings.  I've seen songbirds.  They're actually lovely.  Sometimes I'll wake up and I'll hear, like the little wings flapping and I'll hear,  he-le-le-le-le-le-le.  He-le-le-le.  Like what a delight.  Yeah, usually they're waking you up when you don't want to be awake.  Yes.  They're annoying. 
[00:36:00]  Songbirds.  Shut up!  The sound of a hammer.  Ending his song abruptly.  Giggling children.  Where's the screeching horn bird or whatever the fuck we used to play?  Remember that thing?  I'll give you a songbird.  I'll give you a songbird.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  This guy is a bore.  Continue with the palm, please.  A bore.  It stinks, man.  Yes.  But don't say that on Twitter. 
[00:36:30]  They'll get pissed.  Oh, will they?  They'll get fucking pissed.  Well, of course.  Whispers across cafe tables.  Hear the doors we open each day for each other.  Yeah.  Saying, hello.  Shalom.  Oh.  Buongiorno.  Howdy.  All right, we get it.  Namaste.  We get it.  Or, buenos dias.  What's up?  In the language my mother taught me.  What?  In every language.  Spoken into one wind. 
[00:37:00]  Carrying our lives without prejudice.  As these words break from my lips.  Is this a songbird?  Literally, those birds should just be killed. 
[00:37:30]  Yes.  That's the horn scream bird.  It's a songbird.  Horrible.  It's a lovely songbird.  One sky.  I don't think this guy is setting.  Since the Appalachians and Sierras claimed their majesty.  And the Mississippi and Colorado worked their way to the sea.  Colorado.  Thank the work of our hands.  Oh.  Weaving steel into bridges. 
[00:38:00]  Finishing one more report for the boss on time.  Stitching another wound or uniform.  The first brush stroke on a portrait.  The first brush stroke on a portrait.  Or the last floor on the Freedom Tower.  Jutting into the sky that yields to our resilience.  Does it?  One sky.  This is going great.  Which we sometimes lift our eyes tired from work.  Some days guessing at the weather of our lives. 
[00:38:30]  The weather of our lives?  Some days giving thanks for a love that loves you back.  Be more funny.  Sometimes praising a mother who knew how to give.  Well.  Or forgiving a father.  No shit.  Who couldn't give what you wanted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We head home through the gloss of rain or the weight of snow or the plum blush of dusk. 
[00:39:00]  Plum blush of dusk.  Yes.  Because now the sun's going down.  Oh.  There you go.  He just described a day in America.  In real time.  Good for you.  Our sky.  Look at Obama's just like.  And always up.  One moon.  Yeah.  One moon.  Like a silent drum tapping on every rooftop and every window of one country.  All of us.  No.  Facing the stars.  Plum blush.  Hope.  A new constellation.  What?  Waiting for us to map it. 
[00:39:30]  Hope.  Waiting for us to name it.  You might as content.  Together.  Okay.  Fuck it.  What's next?  Jesus.  Oh my God.  Boo.  That was terrible.  Say that on Twitter.  They get mad?  Have fun with the poets.  They get all mad?  Really?  Oh boy do they.  Don't rhyme.  It ain't a poem if it don't rhyme.  That's what I say.  What did he just describe?  A fucking day in America? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Who the hell knows?  What about all the horrible shit that happens?  Yeah.  Not everyone lives that type of way.  It's full of hope and songbirds.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  Here's my poem.  Wake up.  Go see the boss.  Ah hell.  That's all I got.  Regular Joe.  I like that.  Is the best poet ever.  I like that.  So where were we?  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Poetry.  Second inauguration.  Good to be here.  Kelly Clarkson kicking ass.  Jay-Z looking like a million bucks with Beyonce.  Mm-hmm.  They stole the show up there. 
[00:40:30]  Did they?  Yes they did.  Wow.  Yes they fucking did.  They were the big stars.  Big stars.  They were the big stars.  And when Beyonce did her song and walked away everyone was looking at her ass.  Including Obama took a little peek.  God.  Of course.  What happened?  I don't know.  They're showing lingerie football girls on Fox and Friends.  You know they do that every time the Super Bowl was ready to come up.  Good luck ladies.  Look at that one on the big brunette there.  She's a big girl.  The blonde is the one.  No the brunette.  Both of them. 
[00:41:00]  Oh the blonde.  That brunette's pretty fucking pretty smoking right there.  Much hotter.  She's built for babies.  Man.  She's a big girl.  She is a.  She's a bucksodic.  Yeah.  5'10 and full of tinkle.  Yeah.  Your mother's gone.  Fuck you.  Fuck your mother.  Oh man.  See there's the Jay-Z and the Beyonce looking all fucking presidential and shit.  They look like money.  See they look like money.  Power couple?  They're a big time power couple. 
[00:41:30]  That's a power couple right there.  They look better than the Carters.  What?  When the Carters came strolling out.  Oh really?  They're the new Carters.  That's their last name.  Oh really?  They are the Carters.  The Carters.  Look at that.  There's a tie in.  Terrific.  Terrific.  Jimmy Carter and Rosalind.  Rosalind.  Rosalind.  Rosalind.  Rosalind.  Rosalind.  Rosalind.  They're looking pretty good.  Still around.  Jimmy Carter's 88 I believe.  Wow.  Oh my goodness.  I looked it up.  I looked that shit up.  Damn. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah but when Beyonce sang.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone took a look at her age.  Oh yeah.  Why was it big?  Did she have that big ass?  She looked all right.  Yeah?  Yeah she looked all right man.  Beyonce looked all right.  She looked all right.  Kelly Clarkson's a little big now.  Really?  A little bit.  No that ass is way too big.  No it's not.  Come on.  How dare you?  That Beyonce ass is way too fucking big.  Is that the latest ass picture?  That's probably not the latest.  It doesn't look.  I mean it's a little too big for my taste. 
[00:42:30]  It's huge.  It doesn't look like fucking out of control.  Her ass is huge.  I've seen her on the beach.  That's like choosing fucking rump.  Yeah.  They look terrible on the beach.  Bitch is thick.  Her ass.  Bitch is thick.  Bitch is thick.  That's nice.  She dressed up nice though.  She looks good too.  Would you kiss her hiney Sam?  Oh my goodness.  Ew.  Yeah that's a nice one.  Dude that's a fucking.  Look at that.  That's probably an old picture.  Yeah lick some of the leftover duty.  That's like from Austin Powers days.  Was she in that?  Yep she was.  You want to hear Beyonce singing?  Yeah.  Let's hear a little.  This is going to be a big hit. 
[00:43:00]  I would imagine radio is going to be playing this one.  Is it?  She was very good.  People are going to be downloading.  I don't know.  What the fuck do they fucking do radio anymore out there?  What are the kids doing these days?  It'll get a lot of YouTube hits.  That's about it.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen.  We all need the story of Biff Tannen.  We all need the story of Biff Tannen.  We all need the story of Biff Tannen.  Wow.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh. 
[00:43:30]  Does she color it up?  Does she color it up?  Huh?  Does she color it up a little?  Does she color it up a little?  No.  No?  Oh yeah.  Did she just fuck up?  What happened?  Did she just fuck up there? 
[00:44:00]  What happened?  Twilight Slash.  No, maybe it sounded like she lost her place for an...  How long ago?  Five seconds, not even.  At the twi...  I could be...  Maybe I just misheard it.  I'm going to go back ten just in case.  Wow.  Here it is.  No.  She didn't care.  She's stalking very low. 
[00:44:30]  Because she knows this goes up.  She knows she knows.  These patriotic songs are so hard to sing.  Whoever wrote these things were...  He's an asshole.  Francis Scott Key.  He's an asshole.  He wrote songs that are tough to sing.  Did he have a follow-up hit?  No, I don't think so.  This was his Gangnam Style.  I don't think this was meant to be a song, though.  Gangnam Style.  It's violent. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, she...  There she...  She colored it up right there.  A little bit.  Slightly.  That a flag was to end.  Oh, say just that...  Ah, here she goes. 
[00:45:30]  There's no Whitney Houston.  What?  The music's a little loud.  Yeah, she's alive.  Both soggy lungs.  You're extra mean today.  What happened to you over the weekend?  I don't know.  All right.  Nice.  Nice final note. 
[00:46:00]  It was good.  She was very good.  She did all right, right?  Killed it.  Robert Klein had a very funny bit years ago in a special called Robert...  That's everything with Robert Klein.  I love Robert Klein.  He had a funny bit years ago.  You don't like Robert Klein?  Not anymore.  I'm not a fan of Robert Klein.  Holy fuckaroni.  I mean, Robert Klein makes me fucking laugh.  Really?  Still?  Why, though?  He's just a funny dude.  The way he talks is funny to me.  Yeah, he's just a funny...  If you think he's funny, then I'm going to go back and try to discover Robert Klein as  a funny guy.  I'll say Robert Klein... 
[00:46:30]  Because I never liked him.  Robert Klein at Yale had such an influence on me.  Wow.  Really?  I taped it off of HBO and used to pretend I was Robert Klein.  He's one of my early...  One of my great influences was Klein.  Prior, I always talk about him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love fucking Robert Klein.  So how about we play some Robert Klein at the break?  I don't know.  We don't even know what to recommend.  It's been so many years.  Something from that disc.  The bit I remember...  And again, it may come off bad now.  It was about...  Who cares?  Let's give it a shot.  It was about the... 
[00:47:00]  It's where I learned...  What the fuck's it called?  The National Anthem.  The National Anthem.  He talks about...  How far is it?  How long is it?  It's four minutes.  Far.  That's a little long.  No, that's good.  Okay.  We can put it to break.  It's like our Monday, so it's fine.  By the way, thank you to JoeHoff23 on the old Twitter.  That's Jerry Nadler, the guy that was falling asleep.  And yeah, that's his name.  Oh.  He was a big deal a few years back.  Not so much these days.  What was he a big deal for?  I don't know.  You saw him a lot more.  That's all I'm trying to say.  And he lives in our neighborhood.  He waddles around. 
[00:47:30]  Sam, what did he do?  He's a congressman.  What?  I said that.  From the great state of New York?  Yep.  But he had a little more fucking juice a few years back.  Well, I mean, how many ethnic friends he had are not important.  Hands slathered and lard.  You're going to laugh at that fucking fisting joke all day.  Of course.  Such a violent thing to do.  Fisting joke.  Slathered and lard really implies you're ready for a fist.  Oh, you're ready to throw a punch. 
[00:48:00]  Why would anyone do that?  I don't know.  They can't even lube.  Like, lard is so good for ass fisting, apparently.  That's like an animal fat.  Yes.  How good is a good fisting that you're willing to walk around with shitty underwear for the  rest of your life?  I don't know.  You're not going to fucking keep anything inside.  Why would you do that?  That's good about lard, too.  You could just take a fistful and then squish it, and it'll squeeze out between your fingers,  and you could just use it like that. 
[00:48:30]  Just fucking poof!  A la Caligula.  Yes.  Why would you do that?  I don't know what that...  Like, I can imagine...  I can imagine coming while a girl fucks you with a strap on and pumps your dick.  Like, I can imagine that when that happens to you, you go, oh my god, what a great orgasm  this is, why did I wait until I was 43?  Uh-huh.  I mean, I imagine that's what somebody was saying.  Oh, no, Jimmy!  Did you finally get past your...  Nah.  No?  Nah.  Did you get past your I feel like I'm going to shit thing? 
[00:49:00]  Did you try again?  Well, who wouldn't try again?  Try and try again.  Jimmy's no quitter.  Yeah.  A quitter never wins, and a winner never comes good.  That's funny.  So, uh, Obama fucked up, uh, the oath there.  Yes, he did.  Again.  You know what he took on the United States?  What's wrong with him?  Of course he did.  Nervous Nelly.  I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear...  I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear...  ...that I will faithfully execute...  ...that I will faithfully execute... 
[00:49:30]  ...the office of the President of the United States...  ...the office of the President of the United States...  ...and will to the best of my ability.  ...and will to the best of my ability.  Of course he screwed that up.  Well...  He doesn't consider it the United States.  He probably wanted to say Soviet Union.  He got all tripped up.  See, because he's a commie.  Oh, God.  Enough of him.  I liked his speech yesterday, though.  It was good.  You can't see enough of him.  It was his big day.  I can't get over that Hussein part, to be honest with you.  The fucking middle name is Hussein! 
[00:50:00]  They say H now.  The beginning of the goddamn...  ...like 2000...  ...he never would have been elected!  You missed it.  What happened?  Chuck Schumer calls him Obama...  ...H.  Wait, Barack H. Obama.  Of course!  Because he's petrified of Hussein.  Oh, it's probably just the way it was written in front.  And Obama made a weird face after that.  Like, ah, you fucking fag.  You could say Obama.  Obama whining to say Hussein.  Yeah, it's his name!  That's his fucking name.  You don't give a fuck what his name is?  I wouldn't care.  I give a fuck.  Nah, but if his name was like, you know...  Do you realize how long Saddam Hussein was our arch enemy in this country? 
[00:50:30]  And the guy's middle name is the same name as the guy we hated.  Right after he was our pal.  Exactly.  Maybe they may get named...  Don't forget when Obama was named, though, Saddam Hussein...  ...it was still closer to when he was a friend than when he was a foe.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know about that.  He was a big ally.  I, Barack Hussein Bin Laden Hitler...  It's not like they called it...  Yeah.  What?  It's not like it was Barack Ayatollah Khomeini.  Khomeini!  No.  It was Hussein.  Ask me.  How much did the inauguration cost? 
[00:51:00]  18 trillion gazillion.  I don't know.  And I hear, like, a lot of private funding for that thing.  Probably.  But I hear, you know, but certainly some of our tax dollars...  I'm sure.  Product placement?  It just shows you that we're not in that deep shit.  Oh, of course not.  If we could still pull these things off.  Got Beyonce doing the national anthem.  Yeah, but she did it for cheap.  No way.  You think that was...  She did it for free.  Of course she's not getting paid for that.  She ain't getting paid for that shit.  You think she's getting paid for that?  I won't get paid.  No, I don't think so.  Private plane, maybe.  Why didn't you get James Taylor's performance? 
[00:51:30]  It was uneventful.  James Taylor.  Yeah.  Michelle Obama's hips are crazy.  Crazy.  That woman has a big fucking ass.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Is that her last night?  Look at the size of it.  Yeah.  They're saying she looked beautiful.  Oh, did she?  They sell a lot of dresses now because you picked the red one.  Really?  So that designer is now going to fucking...  They don't even really party.  They show up, they dance, and then they go home.  Yeah.  That's it.  They don't even really stay in any of these things. 
[00:52:00]  Man.  Here's James Taylor.  Let's enjoy some James Taylor.  You have to wait a few seconds.  Why?  The internet.  Why is that?  Is it buffering?  Is that...  I like buffering.  When I have headaches, I take buffering.  There you go.  Wow.  It's my pleasure to introduce renowned musical artist James Taylor. 
[00:52:30]  Oh.  What an awful reading personality he has.  Chuck Schumer.  Terrible.  He loved the spotlight.  What a yutz.  I thought his niece has personality.  Yes, she does.  Yes.  Biden rules.  I saw Amy last night.  Joe Biden rules.  She's a kook.  Oh, really?  Oh, she's a kook.  I love Amy.  She's crazy.  Oh, beautiful.  James Taylor's looking exactly like that skull that the Terminator steps on. 
[00:53:00]  Holy shit.  But he just goes right into it.  Yeah.  No sip of water?  No, but no.  Same voice.  You think he's sick of James Taylor yet?  I am.  God shed his grace on me. 
[00:53:30]  God sheds, apparently.  Yeah, exactly.  He shed his grace.  You need one of those rollers.  Those herpes.  God sheds his grace.  Look at his grace all over our couch.  Exactly.  I told him to fucking, to put a grace net on.  Oh, weird note right there.  He's not done.  Now he'll go to the other part. 
[00:54:00]  There you go.  Think he knew how much better the girls were going to be than him?  No.  He never had a clue.  Who's James Taylor?  That's what we expected.  And now James Taylor.  I want to hear that fucking, what's her name?  Kelly Clarkson.  She was great.  She sound good?  Isn't Obama a big James Taylor fan, apparently?  He would be.  He has to be.  He would be.  He's a dork.  He's a nerd.  Obama is a nerd.  He really is a fucking absolute nerd-a-roo.  Yeah.  I think so.  What did Kelly Clarkson sing? 
[00:54:30]  My country.  My country tits of the age.  It took about ten minutes.  Yeah.  She really slowed it down and made it hers.  Did she?  Oh, boy, did she.  She knew Beyonce was coming up later.  She could beat the poet.  Uh-huh.  So she had to, you know.  She could beat the poet and she could beat James Taylor.  Right.  She was like, this is nothing.  That fucking oinker can belt out a tune, I'll tell you that one.  She was great.  Is he really an oinker now?  What the fuck?  She lost a few pounds.  She's not at our heaviest.  She's still a bit chubby.  But she's still a lot heavier than she was on an idol.  Is she a pappy? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And that's not thick.  That's chubby.  Oh, here she goes.  Well, she's all bundled up.  Who can tell?  She's cute.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Those buttons are screaming.  Yeah.  Oh, you think they're tight?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  She looks like Ozzy in the Shot in the Dark video.  The whole orchestra there and everything?  Yeah.  A lot of money spent.  Oh, yeah.  And ta, ta, ta.  All right. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, she had a little trouble finding her place.  A little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  She's not Beyonce.  She might be nervous.  Second note.  Well, I'd be nervous.  What do you think?  A billion people watching?  She's behind bulletproof glass, maybe?  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe that's it.  First time she's ever been next to an assassination target?  She's got fucking three of them back there.  She's a big target, too.  Exactly.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  The band, the music was too loud.  Yes.  You think the bass is drowning out my vocals?  Turn the bass down.  Yeah.  Hello, exactly.  Got that military-like drum.  Yeah, it's way too loud, the music. 
[00:56:30]  This mix is terrible.  Yeah, we heard a better mix on TV.  I agree.  Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel the heat.  Right.  What a dirge.  Bring it on home, fatso.  Oh.  All right.  Doesn't resemble the song whatsoever.  The band is way too fucking loud.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Turn it down. 
[00:57:00]  No.  It's like Star Wars.  Yeah.  You can't even hear it.  Is there a better version of this?  Yeah, don't worry about it.  My God, man.  That stinks terrible.  Don't worry about it.  Terrible.  That little freedom ring.  What is it, a phone or something?  Oh, God.  Look at that.  Michelle Obama.  My goodness.  She bothers you, huh? 
[00:57:30]  She really bugs the living piss out of me.  Why does she bother you?  Well.  Who cares?  I just don't.  I don't know.  Why would that bother you?  Who gives a fucking care?  She's got a fat ass.  Yeah, but you're never going to fuck it.  Who cares?  I don't know.  I just, I don't know.  Why does it bother you?  Maybe because her husband's the president.  I just don't like him as president.  We'll see what he does this term.  Yeah, well, I've already seen.  I don't care either way.  He's gearing up.  We'll get through it.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Turn this thing around. 
[00:58:00]  He did give a good speech, though.  It wasn't too long.  And a few things he said I thought were really good.  When he started talking, and he started mentioning the forefathers of the people,  and for the, and he's one of the most restrictive fucking right-taking-away motherfuckers that  has ever held the office, and he's talking about how the people, that's the important  thing, is not a tyrannical government running the, but the people have a say.  Shut up.  Well.  Have a say.  They all say shit like that.  I know.  And it's business as usual.  So I cannot like every single one of them that say that. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  I don't like him.  He's just, he hasn't even been able to move the needle that much.  Yeah.  He would love to move the needle way more.  I know.  He's very ideological when he went in.  I believe that he wanted transparency.  I just think he can't do it.  Right.  No, I think he wanted it, but I don't think he could pull it off.  He's the least transparent guy in fucking years.  Why don't we break?  We got the Obama speech.  We got Alicia Keys talking for like a half hour before she fucking gets into her song. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, does she do that?  She does it all the time.  I know.  She's awful.  She talks for a few minutes and then finally starts changing the words to the one song  that she sings at every occasion.  It's a New York?  It's a New York song?  No, her current single.  Oh, I don't know that one.  I don't know that one.  Yeah, you do.  Oh, right.  She did that.  What commercial?  Citibank?  I don't know that one.  Grow on fire?  Which one is it?  It's a big song.  You ever play it on YouTube real quick?  Yeah, I don't know.  And then it's part of commercials and stuff.  Grow on fire.  That's great when we know songs from the commercials they're using.  I think, right?  Yeah.  What commercial is it?  It's already sad if she's on fire. 
[00:59:30]  This is Emily Sunday.  I don't like this.  Ow.  Girl on fire?  That's like being in hell or something.  Good one, Chip.  That's fucking cool.  Yeah, but that's a little heavy.  Fucking good one.  Well, she talks about Obama being on fire.  She's on fire.  Good one.  New York.  Ah!  It's a good song.  Is she trying to be sexy?  Oh, she got both feet on the ground, and she's burning it down. 
[01:00:00]  Is this a big hit for her?  Yeah.  I know it.  She is fucking unbelievable.  This sounds like something.  She's got a great voice.  It sounds like another song.  Crazy Train?  Yeah.  This girl is on fire.  Oh, right.  I've heard that.  Yeah.  MasterCard, right?  Maybe.  Oh, good one.  What?  Lexus?  No.  She's walking on fire. 
[01:00:30]  That's not how you say fire.  This girl is on fire.  Fire.  That's why the girl is yelling, ow, ow.  Get some water.  My tits are burning off.  So bright she can burn your eyes.  Then I look the other way.  We don't have to hear the whole fucking thing.  That was very good.  I was enjoying that.  So she sang that after she talked for a few minutes.  Yeah?  She changed.  She played with the lyrics a little bit.  She did.  She played with it a bit. 
[01:01:00]  What'd she say?  Obama's on fire?  Mm-hmm.  Opa Christmas style.  Remember when?  Oh, God.  Oh.  Morning mashup style.  Psy was not invited to the inauguration.  Big Tootsie style.  Why wasn't Psy there?  He's got big feet.  Because he said he's not performing that song anymore.  Big Tootsie style.  Wait.  The idiot said he's not performing the song anymore?  Is that it?  What a dope.  At the New Year's thing, I believe, he said.  That was it.  That's it for that song.  2013.  What an idiot.  It's the year of the all new Psy singles. 
[01:01:30]  Well, bye-bye.  Well, good luck to you.  Bye-bye, sir.  Wouldn't you sing that song for the next 10 years?  Of course, nobody is hoping for the next single from that dude.  No one.  There's going to be a massive drop-off.  Man.  That's it for him.  Does he have a second single yet?  I mean, he has other songs.  But what song are they going to work?  Morning mashup style.  Ew.  Big Tootsie style.  Big Tootsie style.  Giant Big Toe style.  Giant Bunyan style.  Giant Hammers. 
[01:02:00]  Her feet have elbows.  She swims as good as any diver.  Herman Munster feet.  Giant Tisto ass.  Giant Bunyan.  Why don't we rework the song and hand it in to her?  Yeah.  She would enjoy it.  But he's not performing this anymore? 
[01:02:30]  No.  What a jerk.  He said that's it.  Really?  And then Nicole tries to do this dance and three people are injured when her giant feet  are swatting all over the place.  Morning mashup style.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That's Dootsie.  We're going to break.  You want to play that, Robert Klein?  Dude, he's so sick of that fucking song.  I kind of respect the fact that he won't sing anymore.  He's making millions off that. 
[01:03:00]  Keep going.  What's wrong with you?  That's why I respect him.  He's like, enough with this dumb song.  We get it.  Run that fucking thing into the ground.  Start playing Firehouses.  Whatever it takes.  Keep it going.  He must have performed that song a thousand times.  Because he has no other song.  Yeah.  That's it.  He doesn't have a concert.  No.  No.  And radio's not really playing it anymore.  They've kind of taken it off.  Well, someone find out what the next song is.  Because he had to have another song by now.  And we want to play the next song by him after the break. 
[01:03:30]  The big follow-up?  There has to be a follow-up.  Wouldn't you have the follow-up ready to go?  Get the plaster pouring her footprint.  You've got to have that second song ready to go.  Yeah, really.  He doesn't have a fucking follow-up.  You don't have time.  Nothing.  You don't have time where you sit around and write another song.  It's got to be here.  You say that you're not performing a big hit and you don't even have a follow-up yet.  Right, yeah.  Crazy.  We'll do this Robert Klein thing at the break and then we'll continue. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  The national anthem is still the best part.  Everyone fidgets.  It's a tough one.  I had to sing it in an affair.  When you're in numbers and you feel secure about it, you don't realize it's a four-octave range.  Evidently written for geese.  And the rocket's red!  Forget it.  I mean, it's a great instrumental.  But in fact, I knew the organist at Ebbets Field for many years.  And they stole all his licks.  He was a great musician.  You know, da-da-da-da-da!  He wrote that. 
[01:04:30]  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da!  Fuck!  He wrote that.  He's working in a lounge now at a Holiday Inn.  Playing the organ.  You know.  And the rocket's red!  I had to sing it alone.  Boy, it gets you.  You try to start low and fool it.  Ooh, ooh, stay good.  And the rock!  If you try to reverse it, you start high.  Oh, ooh, stay good. 
[01:05:00]  It still gets you.  And the rock!  It's an old English drinking tune.  I learned that on a shell bicentennial minute.  In 76, instead of giving us two or three cents off gas,  They got these tax-deductible, self-aggrandizing commercials.  But I found out it's an old English drinking tune, which explains the key.  But the lyrics were written by a man eminently qualified to write lyrics for a national anthem.  He was an attorney in Baltimore named Francis Scott Key.  And the phrasing is amateurish. 
[01:05:30]  I mean, when you start off one word and go,  Oh, oh, say!  What did he even thought? He was a 50s doo-wop group, you know.  Oh, oh, daddy!  You know, couldn't lay one note.  Oh, oh, say!  And also, the poem is ridiculous.  I prefer America the Beautiful.  Nice poem. Purple Mountains Majesty.  Nice. A little chill up the spine.  A national anthem. It's about a war we lost.  War of 1812.  Sorry, fellas. Don't like the disillusion.  We were taught in school. We won it. 
[01:06:00]  We got schmeared.  They burned Washington in a battle, which we lost.  But this guy's poem, Francis Scott Keyes,  really doesn't matter because the flag was still there.  Now, look at his priorities, will you?  The fort was pulverized.  Everyone in it was dead.  But he thinks we won because the flag was still there the next morning.  And the English were glad to hear that.  They lost that down.  They used to be able to...  You couldn't interpret it without great risk to your prestige or something else. 
[01:06:30]  Now, everyone does it their own way.  There's a country way of doing it.  Oh, say, can you?  Nightclub lay back.  Oh, say.  In California, the World Series, they always have people who...  Oh, say.  The first person to ever had the balls to interpret it and beautifully was Jose Feliciano  in the World Series a few years ago.  Do you remember?  It was Baltimore, Pittsburgh, I think. 
[01:07:00]  And there he is sitting in acoustic guitar at second base on a stool there.  And the announcer doesn't even know his name.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, I call your attention to second base, to Mr. Jose Feliciano.  No, no.  Cool thing.  The National Anthem.  The Mr. Feliciano.  No, no, no.  And then he shocked everyone.  Oh, say.  Mira, can you see by the door? 
[01:07:30]  Oh, mama, by the door, the light.  Bravest thing I ever saw.  Figured they wouldn't kick the shit out of him because he was blind.  Which was a correct calculation, incidentally, because I know Jose well.  And he got a few hate letters.  You little Puerto Rican.  The people have strange priorities of their own, you know.  And red exit sign.  That's what an exit sign should be.  Red is unequivocal for an exit sign. 
[01:08:00]  Hello, this way.  You know, fire.  In California, they played Stanford.  They have green exit signs.  And it sort of lays a fire.  If you want to get out, it's cool.  If you want to get out, it's all right.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, we don't need that shit.  Everyone knows the show. 
[01:08:30]  If you're playing Earl Weaver, then we talk right after Earl Weaver because we play that because he died.  Yeah.  You don't need the big pew after shit like that.  Earl Weaver, what, 82?  Dead?  Yeah.  And Stan Musial.  Musial.  Stan Musial.  Stan Musial.  We lost two big-time baseball guys over the weekend.  Damn.  And we also lost Prop Joe from The Wire.  Oh, yeah.  Joe Joe.  Wait, what was his name?  Something Chew.  He's Prop Joe.  And also...  I don't know him from anything else, so to me, he's Prop Joe.  The real Omar died. 
[01:09:00]  Yes.  Oh, the real Omar.  The guy who Omar was based on.  How did he die?  It might have been hard.  It's funny.  I don't...  Was it gunned down or anything like that?  No, no, no.  I think it was natural causes.  Who would believe that the real Omar died of fucking natural causes?  Yeah.  But how old?  Prop Joe was only, I think...  52.  Prop Joe was 52, but the real Omar, how old?  He had to be...  I'm going to guess 55.  I'm going to...  That's a total guess.  Natural causes.  54, maybe.  That's...  Was he 58?  No, Omar.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Okay.  Oh, the real Omar was 58. 
[01:09:30]  Let me see.  Not the Omar that Michael K. Williams played.  What did he die of?  Michael K. Williams, still alive.  Oh, yeah.  Donnie Anderson.  Donnie Andrews.  He was the real life Omar.  Complications during emergency heart surgery.  Oh, that's not natural.  Both of them.  58.  You could see on his face, though, that he was good in the show, but you could see on  his face that he was a fucking...  He's a problem, if he wants to be.  Yeah.  Was he ever on the wire?  Yeah, many times.  He was fucking...  In a game of cameo?  A couple cameos?  He was in a bunch.  He was in the jail scene with the real Omar. 
[01:10:00]  With the TV Omar, he helped put the fucking thing around his stomach in case he got stabbed.  Oh.  He was one of those guys in the shootout up in the fucking loft.  He was one of the guys that got killed up there.  He was in the show.  I had no idea until just now.  Yeah.  Very good.  And that fucking preacher?  Yeah.  The little old man preacher in the wire?  You know?  Was a fucking real gangster.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was one of the guys that ran Baltimore.  Crazy cast that show had.  They used real guys.  He was real fucking smarts.  He used the real guys.  Yeah.  Was he a gay guy, this Donnie Andrews? 
[01:10:30]  I do not know.  Was he gay?  Do you have a little twinkie fucking boyfriend?  I have no idea.  I got his face beat in.  Brandon.  Oh, my God.  He was handsome.  Oh, did he take it poorly?  Cigarette burns.  He probably was, because if Omar's playing him as a gay guy, I mean, this guy would have  been fucking pissed if he wasn't gay.  Man, motherfucker.  You're like, what the fuck, man?  Why are you all playing me like that?  We were just talking about Prince Harry during the break.  Prince Harry is the man.  He's a badass man.  Because he's not, uh, because Prince Charles isn't his real father. 
[01:11:00]  Exactly.  Like, his real father is that other guy.  I always forget his name.  A real man.  And he was a real man.  And Prince Harry's a real man.  No, not Spencer.  James, uh...  James, uh...  Earl Jones.  Yes.  James B.C. King.  Oh, no.  James Hewitt.  Ah, James Hewitt.  I believe.  Yeah.  James Hewitt is, uh, Harry's father.  A man's man.  Most people know that.  No one wants to acknowledge it over there in the Royal Palace.  No.  But Prince Harry has a different father. 
[01:11:30]  And his father was a real man.  Yeah, and now you got Harry, he's like on his second tour.  He's up in helicopters killing Arabs.  Well, he's in a lot of trouble because he bragged that he killed Taliban.  Hey, he don't care.  He don't give a shit.  Apparently, neither does the royal family.  Prince Harry has acknowledged that he killed Taliban insurgents on his latest tour of duty.  Yeah.  Yes.  He was part of an Apache attack helicopter.  Holy fuck.  He's getting into some shit.  Oh, he's crazy like that.  He loves it.  Yeah, but...  He's up there firing off some missiles at those motherfuckers.  Can we, uh, get a picture of Prince Harry's real father? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, boy.  In our humble opinion.  Look at that.  I mean, come on.  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  Come on.  It's just time.  Oh, boy.  Look at...  That's him.  That is so funny.  He so fucking is that guy.  That's why they hated Diana.  Everyone else in that family starts losing their hair at 12 years old.  But Prince Harry still has...  At 12.  Prince Harry has a full head of fucking red hair like his father.  Unbelievable.  Like his real father.  You don't think he looks like Charles?  God, no.  Not even close.  Look at that picture.  And that pussy William looks like Charles. 
[01:12:30]  Of course.  Dude, look at this fucking picture.  Look at the nose.  The nose is exactly the same.  It's the same nose.  The smile.  Well, you can see the...  The eyes.  You can see the prince dying there as well.  But you don't see Prince Charles.  The smile the same.  The hair color is relatively the same.  Dote.  Dote.  The eyes are the same.  The nose is the same.  They won't acknowledge it.  It's...  Why won't they acknowledge it?  Who cares?  They got plenty of guys that are going to be the king.  Heathrow lady died.  They don't need him anymore.  Fucking jizz.  There he is. 
[01:13:00]  I killed some Taliban insurgents.  He's got like a different body than his brother.  Can we see a picture of the simp, William?  Yeah.  And his fucking coddled father.  Yeah, put William next to this.  And the father.  And that fucking balding, awful Charles.  Fucking balding, no king goose.  Life of fucking...  A life of comfort.  Yes.  What a fuddy-duddy.  Yeah.  Come on.  Stop.  Oh, God.  You can see the princess die in Prince...  That's when he had hair. 
[01:13:30]  That's...  Yeah, what are you doing?  What is that from Christmas?  Yeah, he was just fucking...  Let's get a new picture of him where he's just fucking looking...  Oh, God.  That's not...  That's old, too.  That's even old.  Cocksucker.  Come on, you fuck.  He's had a tough year.  Piece of garbage.  Oh, God.  Yeah, see?  Oh, boy.  See?  Oh, jeez.  I can't see, because we don't have that visual.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  See?  Oh, look at that wispy hair on top.  Just like his dad.  He must have been so mad. 
[01:14:00]  Going like, Jesus, Pops, look what you did to my hair.  And then his brother...  Look at his brother's head.  He has like the wolf man.  He has fucking...  Oh, my God.  What a wispy, awful dude he has.  Why would one brother have no hair and the other have too much hair?  That hair ran away from his head.  It's that jean shit, huh?  Wow.  Yeah, because his father isn't the same guy.  That's why, yes.  Oh, my God.  Not only does he have a forehead, it's almost touching his eyebrows. 
[01:14:30]  He has so much forehead, hairline.  Sorry, fuck.  Complete opposite of what I was trying to say.  It's the opposite day of the old Pete Anthony show.  It's like when I was backwards, man, for Halloween.  That's a good one.  Where's Prince Charles?  Yeah, show Prince Charles.  Let's put them all up there.  Let's put all the people up there.  Come on now.  All the fucking principal players.  Please.  Come on there, Sam.  The two fathers and the two sons.  And now let's put Princess Di up there, too, because that's the common denominator.  Yes.  That's it.  Yes, let's do some investigating. 
[01:15:00]  That's the common denominator.  We're doing investigative journalism here.  But of course Prince Harry's out there killing Taliban.  Yeah.  His father was that type of guy.  Like his pop.  Right.  Crazy fucking badass.  So the fruit's putting up balloons in the fucking...  So why doesn't the other guy talk?  You think they paid him off?  Said, look, man, we need your son because it's important to the royal family.  So you shut your fucking mouth.  Here's a lot of money.  Yeah.  It's also better for his son.  And you get to see him for, you know, here and there.  Oh, look at the comb over Prince Charles does.  Did we see it?  Yeah, but the Prince Charles has more hair than his son. 
[01:15:30]  I know.  What the fuck?  Sort of.  Oh, he was in the military.  What's that uniform William's wearing?  Yeah.  They gave him the silly stuff, though.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Prince Harry's like, fuck that.  I wouldn't be on...  I wouldn't be on...  I don't know.  I don't think Prince William actually was in any real danger.  No.  Didn't he rescue someone in the water and they made a big deal about it?  Did he?  He was a pool, though.  There's a man.  There's a man.  Right.  There you go.  There's a person.  So there you go.  There's all the principles.  You tell me Prince Harry isn't that... 
[01:16:00]  That's ridiculous.  He looks nothing like it.  But of course, looking at the Lady Di picture up there...  Oh, that's right.  Sam didn't put it up.  You did tell Sam.  Of course.  That's all right.  Sam just laughs at me.  We could all figure out what Prince's dialogue says.  Yeah, remember?  We could just find the clip when we did this last time.  Oh!  Iraq, have we done this one before?  Yes.  How many times would you guess?  This should be three.  Oh, a black and white picture. 
[01:16:30]  That's good.  Out of all the color pictures of her.  There she is.  Oh, wasn't she beautiful?  We got Alicia Keys and we got Obama's speech.  We got like two things from Obama's speech.  Remember your ex with Lady Di?  Holy shit.  It was like she was fucking her relative.  We did this part too.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, she was fucking obsessed with Lady Di.  Really?  She was inconsolable for weeks.  She thought she could be a princess, I guess.  Did you think so?  No.  Remember she would just burst into tears like a week later?  She burst into tears because it was Tuesday. 
[01:17:00]  Today's Tuesday.  So she's probably crying somewhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With her stupid brother blaming me for his failed radio career still.  Oh, boy.  Still?  Go fuck yourself.  Oh, boy.  You had four or five opportunities since this show.  Really?  If you were that great, why aren't you working?  Go fuck yourself.  Oof.  Fuck that whole family.  Damn.  Enough already.  That'll work out.  Whole family.  Enough already.  Nerox saying we've done this prank. 
[01:17:30]  No, I added the fuck yous.  Oh, cool.  I knew I had to add something different.  Yeah.  That's why I went there.  Punch it up a little.  A little spice.  Yeah.  Something new.  The guy wasn't even qualified to be on the show to begin with.  He wasn't?  No.  Jesus.  No.  I was dating his sister.  That's how it happened?  Yes.  A little nepotism, they call that.  He did all right with the position.  That's it.  Jesus Christ.  Enough already with these idiots. 
[01:18:00]  Why?  Is more stuff happening?  Yeah.  It just continues to happen.  Obsessive little bitches that never moved on with their own fucking lives and careers.  It's the bitches that'll get you, by the way.  If you're so great, where are you now?  What are you doing now?  Hmm.  I wonder.  Anyway, Obama's speech yesterday.  We got a couple little tastes here.  We'll start with this one.  We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and privacy and openness. 
[01:18:30]  Nice.  An endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention.  My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment and we will seize it so long as we seize it together.  Shut up.  People are so dumb.  What does that mean?  I tweeted, seize it together.  I think that's not proper English.  Oh, yeah, you did.  And people were like, you mean seize, S-E-I-Z. 
[01:19:00]  Really?  Oh, boy.  I spelled it S-E-E-S.  Yes, of course you did.  We seize it together.  We seize it.  Yo, we seize it together.  People are so dumb.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For we, the people, five we, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking  few do very well and a growing many barely make it. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, is that it?  And that's my fucking problem?  We believe that America's prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle  class.  Really?  How come I'm carrying the whole fucking show?  We know that America's rise when every person can find independence and pride in their work.  Really?  Even the leeches on welfare?  When the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardships.  Yeah.  Honest labor?  Mm-hmm.  We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she  has the same chance to succeed as anybody else because she is an American. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  She is free and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God, but also in our own.  Exactly.  She could do anything.  Oh, that's right.  She just got shot by a stray fucking bullet from a gang member.  What happened?  Well, that little person, that little girl that was being raised in poverty can do anything  right up until that bullet rips through her skull because the savages are animals.  Because there's too many guns on the street?  No.  You say gun control?  No.  I think that was a gun control statement. 
[01:20:30]  Nah.  Oh, interesting.  It was more an anti-savage statement.  Anthony's gun control.  What happened?  Why does this bother you so much?  This shit, nothing changes.  Who cares?  Because he's full of horse shit.  You could go back ten presidents with their speeches and it's all business as usual crap.  I don't know.  I think it's because I don't like...  It's all rah-rah for a day and then they go back to fighting for the next four years.  Because I don't like the diversity.  Diversity's ruining this fucking country. 
[01:21:00]  It really is.  Wow.  I like a little diversity, but I like white people being in charge mostly.  Wow.  Because when diversity starts taking charge, you know, people clamor to get over the borders  and they're going to start redoing this immigration thing, which means a lot of amnesties are going  to be going on.  Well, you know who really pushed for that?  It wasn't...  It was the Bush.  The Bush?  Bush.  Yeah.  Well, he's got a couple of them in his family.  Ant's not like a...  Ant's not like a racist racist.  Uh-huh.  But he's the father in American History X. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, right, right.  I'm not...  This affirmative black-shin.  Affirmative black-shin.  Yeah, I'm not...  You're not the racist.  I'm not the Edward Norton character.  I'm the father that made him that way.  You're not a fan of diversity, though?  That's what our country was built on, no?  No, it was built on diversity through assimilation.  Now it's just diversity, go fuck everything.  It's bad-mouth everything that made this country great.  We talk about how great this country is.  Obama was up there yesterday doing a speech about how great this country is. 
[01:22:00]  It's an amazing, great, limitless country.  Meanwhile, they bash everybody that built it to that great nation.  Because they were white men.  And that is apparently the worst thing you could ever be.  And, oh, what?  You want to put another old white guy in charge?  Oh, yeah.  You mean those people that, you know, put us on the moon, won a fucking world war?  Or, uh, it's just, I'm sick of it.  The problem with it, though, is, you're right, the white guys were in charge and that happened. 
[01:22:30]  And they rolled!  But, but there was a lot of people who also contributed.  Fuck them!  Who weren't allowed to do certain.  Like, that's a, that's a disgraceful embarrassment.  You know, the ones that built the infrastructure?  What went over to fight and fight in a war?  Right.  Well, whatever.  Like, a lot of those old white men didn't send their own sons to go fight in a war.  A lot of those...  Yeah, back in the Great War.  But you know what I mean?  World 1, 2?  Yeah, the Great War.  They didn't, Korea?  The war to end all wars.  They didn't send their children to go fight in the war.  They just sat here.  And then people that could go fight in the war came back and got treated like terrible. 
[01:23:00]  That's fucking very...  That's not 500 years ago.  That's 60 years ago.  I agree.  It's very embarrassing.  Soldiers are still being treated terribly.  There were some instances of terrible things going on, but, you know, I don't think you're  going to see Obama's daughters joining the military either.  I'll be quite honest with you.  No, you won't.  So that has nothing to do with diversity or color or anything?  No, but I mean the fact that people who did go fight were treated terribly when they  came back.  And we have all... 
[01:23:30]  I love all this fucking outpouring for soldiers now because the country was shamed.  Half of it's fake.  Yes.  Because the country was shamed because they didn't treat Vietnam soldiers the way they  should have.  You mean the baby killers?  Exactly.  I mean, that's exactly the attitude the country took.  The country shit on these poor fucking guys coming back from Vietnam.  Because they weren't victorious.  When soldiers come back victorious, it's like the big parade thing.  When your team loses the Super Bowl, there isn't that big outpouring at the airport when  they come in.  You know? 
[01:24:00]  But the winner gets the ticket tape parade.  So World War II, people would, you know, the last real win we had, people like freak  out.  They're like, yay!  Vietnam was a fucking boondoggle.  But before the victory had been decided, they were anti-soldier.  Yeah, yeah.  There was a real anti-soldier feel in the country.  And then America got guilted in 1990.  This whole pro-soldier...  And again, I'm happy to see it for soldiers.  Yeah, but I think it's phony.  But half of it is fake, it's because people were fucking shamed by the disgusting way 
[01:24:30]  that Vietnam soldiers were treated.  And they should have been shamed by it.  But we're not treating the soldiers any better right now.  You're right.  A lot of these guys are coming home and killing themselves.  Right.  Yeah.  We're not taking care of them.  It's more of a farce.  It seems like we are in a way, but we forget about them when they come home.  It's terrible.  They were talking about it yesterday.  I would love to know how many soldiers killed themselves last year.  The number's ridiculous.  I think they said it was more than...  Well, there was one month where there was more suicides than combat deaths.  Wow.  Is that true? 
[01:25:00]  I don't doubt it.  I wouldn't doubt it.  It's crazy.  Obama continued.  Oh.  We, the people...  Xbox.  Oh.  ...declare today that the most evident of truths, that all of us are created equal...  Really?  ...is the star that guides us still.  Beyonce.  Just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall, just as it guided  all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great mall, to 
[01:25:30]  hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone, to hear a king proclaim that our individual  freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul honor.  He also said, uh, judge people on the content of their character.  That's what I do.  Well.  Well, I do.  I don't care if they were perfect.  It is now our generation's task.  You trying to convince people of that?  Yeah.  I do, though.  I absolutely judge people on the content of their character.  And I notice a big swath of people that are characterless. 
[01:26:00]  Jesus.  I do.  It is now our generation's task to carry on what those pioneers began.  Pies in their ears?  For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living  equal to their efforts.  What?  Listen to them women.  They love it.  Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone 
[01:26:30]  else under the law.  Wow.  I didn't actually...  We are truly created equal.  Good for him.  I didn't hear him say that.  First time that was mentioned in a speech.  Wow.  In inaugural...  In inaugural...  Everyone's equal.  The queebs, the quays, the moes, and the light and the loafers.  I did not fucking hear that yesterday.  Well, that's all bullshit, though.  Our gay brothers...  Okay.  Our gay brothers and sisters.  That's all bullshit because he turned...  He changed his tune on that whole thing.  And then he realized it worked for him, so he kept going with it.  He doesn't need it now.  Yeah.  He wasn't for gay marriage at all. 
[01:27:00]  No, but when you give it a rah-rah speech.  It was against his teachings.  Yeah.  No, I mean, he changed his tune, what, during the campaign?  Yep.  Wasn't he forced to because Biden...  He was basically forced to.  Biden gave his position away.  Yeah.  On TV and was like, oh shit, that's my best president.  This is pretty yummy, boss.  Biden rules.  I fucking love Joe Biden.  He's a curmudgeon.  He's not a curmudgeon.  He really isn't.  No.  He's a fun-loving guy.  He seems curmudgeonly.  Not even...  Really?  Not even in the least. 
[01:27:30]  Because I see it, like, on those debates, he was all, hey, let me tell you.  No, he's all smiley and he just loves being there.  And I tweeted yesterday, I'm convinced he thought everyone was there for him.  He's one of those guys.  Oh, boy.  It's almost like, oh, Obama.  Obama's in my way.  This is my day.  Oh, boy.  He's one of those guys.  He's delusional.  I don't even think he's delusional.  Hey, it's the poet.  Where?  Right there, up on CNN.  It's the guy.  Good for him.  I have to deliver a poem that you've written.  What was that moment like?  Well, nerve-wracking to say this, but actually... 
[01:28:00]  He has a good voice.  Up there on the platform, it seems a lot more intimate than one would think, simply because  you're sort of seated closely together, and there is...  You think he got laid?  Yeah, for sure.  Oh, my God.  He got some of that.  Yeah.  He got a big, thick one.  Oh, God, you were so fucking good.  And he went, thank you.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  See, because his face is on the pillow.  Yeah, his hair's a little messy.  Yeah, it is a little must.  Yeah. 
[01:28:30]  Here's what kind of boots he's wearing.  Obama talking about equality.  I didn't catch that yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Someone said he mentioned gays.  I'm like, I didn't...  No, that was a big deal.  That was the first time I was ever done.  In that spot.  I mean, none of the other real fucking, real equality for everyone presidents mentioned  that group?  No, not Clinton.  Clinton was, like, one of the most open-minded presidents.  He never mentioned it.  You know, this is what drives me...  It's all bullshit.  That's what I try to tell you people.  Like, he could yell and scream all he wants yesterday. 
[01:29:00]  It's all business as usual today in Washington.  But just the rah-rah America shit is like...  And believe me, I know, I love living here.  I love this...  I love it.  But the reality is...  I hate when people won't acknowledge how full of shit the country is when they talk  about everybody's rights, when every single group gets their rights but has to fight for  them.  Well, let me tell you something.  They have to fight for them.  There's a reason a lot of presidents didn't rah-rah for gay rights.  The truth of the matter is, up until very recently, gays had a very negative image of themselves. 
[01:29:30]  And they are partly to blame for that.  There was this flamboyant gay pride parade, half-naked kind of an image that the gays  had.  And if a president endorsed that, he'd look like a fool.  But up until recently, we're seeing gay people that are, you know, just like you and me,  except for the fact that they, you know...  But the truth of the matter is, dude, they had a very bad image.  Doesn't matter.  It's...  I'm not even talking about gays necessarily.  I'm only saying, like, every group that gets their rights has to fight to be acknowledged 
[01:30:00]  and get what is supposed to be in the Bill of...  But you have to earn...  But you see?  I thought it was an inalienable right, though.  Well, let's be real.  When the Irish came over, they were shit upon.  Yes!  Until they proved...  That's my point!  That's Jimmy's point!  Until they proved...  Every...  Italians would treat, like, dog shit!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Every group!  But we openly say how everyone's created equal, but they all had to fight for that bullshit.  Because it's human nature.  We forget about the human aspect of who we are. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, no, we get all...  We're fucking horrid creatures.  No, we get all that, but Jimmy's making a really good point about it.  Every group has to fucking explain why they deserve the rights that certain people already have.  Not once in this country does a group go, you can have these rights and we shouldn't.  Right.  So we should stop fucking telling the rest of the world how to live when we still, at this point,  treat fucking a percentage of our citizens like not equal.  Preach. 
[01:31:00]  Fucking drives me crazy.  Preach it, Jimmy.  Drives me nuts, man.  Speak it.  Yeah.  Can you go to MentalityMag on Twitter?  What are we looking for?  There's some soccer player that had to leave a game to take a dump, and when he got back,  the crowd greeted him with a, he went for a shit chance.  Oh, God.  I wish we could do that with the E-Rock.  MentalityMag, he does a good job on his website.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He had to change the name of his site. 
[01:31:30]  Why?  I forgot what it was called.  It might have been Puddle of AIDS or something, and he's trying to go a little more mainstream.  A little more mainstream than Puddle of AIDS.  Was it Puddle of AIDS?  I forget now already.  Something like that.  But here.  So we can get two brothers on now.  I'm sure he was already there.  He is not a substitute.  We went for a shit.  We went for a shit.  We went for a shit.  That is a question. 
[01:32:00]  We went for a shit.  He went for a shit.  It would seem that the crowd knew exactly why he had that for sure.  They knew exactly how they described that, however.  Good for him.  He is.  If that was an American announcement, they would have just talked over it and pretended  they didn't hear it.  It never happened.  I got to retweet that shit.  Very good.  That's pretty funny, man.  MentalityMag on the old Twitter there.  Very good.  Probably the most exciting part of the game, by the way.  Soccer.  Soccer rules, right?  Not really.  No, I hate it. 
[01:32:30]  It's a big-ass field with a lot of running.  I've tried.  A sport where they can go to commercial and they don't stop the action.  Yeah.  And they come back.  All you need to know.  Nothing changed.  Now we have to deal with the soccer.  Oh, boy.  Let me tell you.  It's fucking...  Here's more Obama.  For if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal  as well.  Love you, tag.  It's equal to the love you make.  Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right 
[01:33:00]  to vote.  Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful  immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity until bright young students  and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country.  What is that in reference to?  Because that one annoyed me.  What the fuck is that?  But is that in reference to something else?  Yeah.  Just open the borders then. 
[01:33:30]  I give up.  Turn it into a third world country already.  That's what you want to do.  Look how great Mexico is.  If there's so many wonderful fucking people in Mexico, how come Mexico stinks?  If there's so many great engineers and fucking all these people we need over here, then why  isn't Mexico an amazing place?  They're all trying to leave.  What bugs me about immigration is that when you say, like, just go through the process  and you're welcome to come.  I don't mind immigrants.  I just want them to go through the process.  Right.  Then all of a sudden you see, like, Hispanic groups won't acknowledge.  They'll go, oh, no way. 
[01:34:00]  All of a sudden that's like a fucking hotbed issue and you're a racist.  It's like, get the fuck out of here.  Exactly.  Let me say hi to Marty in Merrick.  Marty.  Okay, Marty.  Yes, Marty?  I can't hear you.  What do you think?  You're saying Obamaphone?  I don't know what he was saying.  I don't know.  He was just screaming like a girl.  Jesus.  What was he saying?  He was probably trying to praise me.  I wouldn't.  Oh.  Nothing is expelled from our country. 
[01:34:30]  Country.  Yeah.  He really gets the black thing going when he gives speeches.  Mark.  Our journey is not complete.  Yeah.  Until all our children.  We come to fire.  From the streets of Detroit, to the hills of Appalachia, to the quiet lanes of Newtown.  Oh, boy.  Know that they are cared for.  For.  And cherished.  And always safe from harm.  Always?  That is our generation's task. 
[01:35:00]  He really does get that black thing going.  And that black half of him comes out when he gives them speeches, doesn't it?  Oh, my God, my God.  By the way, Brad Petty, you're an idiot.  Oh, Brett Petty.  Boy, I would have.  He writes on Twitter, being gay is a lifestyle choice.  Being Irish or black isn't.  You can't compare.  They're the same struggle.  Just one more way.  First of all, that's certainly not true.  And another way that people explain why it's okay for them to have certain rights and not  other people to have certain rights.  Because we don't choose to be this way, so we deserve the rights.  But you choose to be that way, so you're making a choice, therefore you don't deserve... 
[01:35:30]  Shut the fuck up.  Jim, he's being petty.  Yeah, what are you fucking Richard's cousin?  Something zoom, zoom, cocksucker.  It's a good one.  I know.  So Obama did his speech, and there you go.  I guess we're in for a remarkable four years.  That'll be average at best again.  Like it?  I'm in.  And then this.  748 on this Thursday morning.  Coming up next, the most expensive way to celebrate the president's second term. 
[01:36:00]  Good morning, Holly.  Is there any other way that you would want to celebrate it?  Hey, listen, we are live this morning at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel.  It's been a key inaugural spot for 150 years.  This inauguration, of course, is now...  Whoa!  Look out!  Did she say what I think she said?  Yeah, it went viral.  Did she say what I think?  That's a tough word to say.  But you know you're not...  She probably wouldn't have said that, but you just know that that's the one thing you 
[01:36:30]  can't say.  Oh, it's the one thing.  748 on this Thursday morning.  Coming up next, the most expensive way to celebrate the president's second term.  Good morning, Holly.  Is there any other way that you would want to celebrate it?  Hey, listen, we are live this morning at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel.  It's been a key inaugural spot for 150 years.  This inauguration, of course, is no...  Oh, boy.  As she continues on, oh, her neck hair is standing up.  Oh, yeah.  She's just picturing herself getting her resumes together.  Wow.  Is her co-host black or white? 
[01:37:00]  I don't know.  I think it was a white guy.  I think it was white.  Oh, my God.  Yikes.  I hope she's not going to get in trouble, right?  I doubt it.  It's just a mistake.  Oh, my God.  What is that light falling on somebody?  What?  It looks like a giant light is falling on a wrestler.  Oh, my God.  What was that?  What the fuck happened there?  In a minute, but right now, we've got some headlines for you.  You missed it.  Jesus.  It looks terrible.  I don't know what happened there.  Oh, that looks terrible.  We didn't find out.  Yes.  Did you see the Bill Russell thing?  What was that?  Bill Russell was up there with his Celtics hat, and someone thought he was Morgan Freeman. 
[01:37:30]  And that's a big deal today, too.  Really?  They call him Morgan Freeman?  Is there actual audio?  Wait.  Was he the black guy, tall black guy, shaking hands with everybody going by, or no?  He had the big white beard.  Oh, no.  That's right.  There was one black guy that had the best spot, who Bill Clinton hugged, Stephanopoulos  made the mistake.  George Stephanopoulos.  Do we have the audio?  Looks like it.  This was pretty funny.  It went viral.  All right.  And look at that crowd gathered now.  It was Morgan Freeman, I think. 
[01:38:00]  Right there in the Capitol steps.  Morgan Freeman.  Bill Russell, I'm sorry.  Thank you, David.  I'm a racist.  A great deal.  How did he make that mistake?  Right?  He's a nerd.  He's not a fucking sports guy.  Bill Russell is a nerd.  He's a nerd, and he's a fucking, he's a white Washington person.  He knows no black people, and he knows nothing about sports.  Well, he was on Clinton's team, so.  Oh, that's a good point.  He probably knows some black people.  He might know some, but.  Yeah, why would you say that?  It didn't even look like Morgan Freeman. 
[01:38:30]  With the beard and everything.  There's two black anchors that.  Oh, she said it.  Oh, shit.  No, it's two black anchors, and the woman who said it was a white chick.  It was white.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wait.  A white chick to two black anchors?  Yes.  Oh, it couldn't be any worse.  Oh, Jesus.  Go ahead.  Hit that again.  Oh, no.  7.48 on this Thursday morning.  Oh, no.  The most expensive way to celebrate the president's second term.  Yes.  Good morning, Holly.  Is there any other way that you would want to celebrate it?  Hey, listen. 
[01:39:00]  We are live this morning at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel.  It's been a key inaugural spot over the last 15 years.  This inauguration, of course, is no exception.  They always have special things like this amazing.  She didn't trip off.  Flawless cover.  You gotta give it to her.  Yep, flawless.  Go back to the anchors, though.  She keeps babbling.  They have to go back, no?  Mm-mm.  It's just her.  Into spots.  I'll say amazing fucking.  She did not.  No, she didn't fucking blink.  That's pretty goddamn good.  Two black anchors.  Oh, that stinks.  Damn.  We get to Alicia Keys, who has to talk before she sings. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  Do we have the talking?  Oh, yeah.  Track one is the talking.  She plays a little bit and has to talk, set the mood.  Oh, she's got to fucking warm up the audience.  Let them know how she's feeling.  Mm-hmm.  Today is an incredible day.  And you can feel the energy everywhere that you go.  Can you?  You know, in so many ways. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Every day.  This song stinks.  Is a new day.  And a new chance.  Everyone knows every day is a new day.  Well, that's her other song, right?  But a new chance to be on this.  Every day is the same day.  I just always think she could have sang another song there.  Dang, dang, dang.  If you're an Alicia Keys fan, you're like, why don't you fucking just sing another song there?  Is her last name really Keys?  Because that's really coincidental.  Let me find out.  I don't know.  She plays piano.  Sometimes that shit just happens.  You know? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that's a stage name.  Her original name is Alicia Ivory Tickler.  Highest purpose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I'm going to need your help tonight, you know.  Sure.  Because I'm up here all by myself.  I just wanted it to be me and you.  Yeah.  So help me celebrate this most monumentous day. 
[01:41:00]  Monumentous.  Monumental.  Dummy.  Momentous or monumental.  Exactly.  I need you to sing.  No.  I don't want to say that.  Come on.  I hate when she...  I hate when she...  Oh, she's got a drinking problem.  She's stuck on the side of the road.  Automobile Club of America.  How do people say? 
[01:41:30]  How do people say?  Her last name's Cook.  What?  Alicia Cook.  She was born Alicia Cook.  Cook.  Imagine if she was a chef.  Yeah, that would be good.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Alicia Cookies.  She's delicious.  Cookies.  He's president and he's on fire.  Fire.  I hate when they do this. 
[01:42:00]  He's living in a world and it's on fire.  That doesn't sound good.  World on fire.  She's fucking good, though, man.  I've never wanted to go see a singer like that live.  Oh, you want to see?  I might.  You'd be bored after 10 minutes.  Maybe.  Got his head in the clown.  And he's not backing down.  He's fucking tall. 
[01:42:30]  He's not white.  He's brown.  Obama's on fire.  You can't say Obama's on fire.  Oh, my God.  Put him out.  That's crazy.  There's a secret service.  How did that happen?  Exactly.  By sneaking to Newport.  Obama's on fire.  Speaking of sneaking to Newport.  Obama fire.  Bam, bam.  A lot of controversy because he was chewing gum during the whole parade. 
[01:43:00]  And they're trying to figure out if it was nicotine gum.  It's amazing that we thought they really asked about that.  Well, they didn't ask, but they're like, everyone was trying to figure out why he was chewing gum the whole time.  But he likes gum.  Oh, I had a good joke that used the word Wrigley's, but I won't say it here.  And now you're putting it in everyone's mind.  Of course.  That's how I roll.  Giving secret messages to your people, I see.  To my fucking minion.  I wouldn't call them secret messages.  It's more like fucking pig Latin.  Oh, but that's just Latin to Iraq. 
[01:43:30]  The pig thing.  That's right.  El fetisho.  You think Obama's a big smoker?  Yeah.  And we just don't know it?  Well, yeah, he's been for many years.  I don't know if he still does, but.  Yeah, remember?  He was smoking.  He has the smoker's face.  Yeah.  Obama's on fire.  His face looks a little dry.  At one point she made reference to his girl, Michelle.  Oh.  What'd she say?  His girl, Michelle. 
[01:44:00]  Really?  Yeah.  She did.  You see Jennifer Hudson?  No.  Fuck.  That's your girl?  Who is that?  Really?  It's hot, but you know, if you take that dress off, it's a saggy.  A world of hurt.  But they pushed it all together nice into those dresses, man.  Holy fuck.  A world of hurt coming down on that body.  She looked fucking good, man.  The Obamas came out for their dance, and next thing you know, there's Jennifer Hudson 10  feet away singing to that.  It's so fucked up.  What was she singing?  Look how hot she is.  That fucking, when you see what she originally looked like on American Idol, it's not even 
[01:44:30]  the same person.  Yeah, do a side-by-side with that.  It's great.  That little afro she had.  A little fat.  Now she's like all shapely and shone.  Her family was murdered.  Like, she had a fucking horrible...  What was it?  Like, her mom and her...  Was it?  Yeah.  God.  There were a few people.  That's even later, because she's got her hair done.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  That's the same person.  E-rock.  See?  Because...  I'm kidding, of course.  Uh, no, she's got her her did in her makeup.  Yeah, get the American Idol picture. 
[01:45:00]  Get the American Idol audition picture, because she is a goddamn disaster in that.  She's got a hell of a voice.  Nice language.  Oh.  Do we have her performance?  I can get it.  Hmm.  She was singing on, like, the dance floor?  Ten feet away is there, Charlie Darius.  Look, look at this.  Oh, my God.  That's the same girl.  Let's see that.  That's not...  Oh, my God.  You would bet a lot of money that's not the same girl.  I bet $25.  Wow.  Hard on, $25. 
[01:45:30]  Wow, look at that.  Get the fuck out of here.  Doesn't even look like the same girl.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Astounding.  Is that...  That was her when she auditioned for Idol?  Mm-hmm.  And Idol is...  That show's happening this year.  Oh, boy.  It was Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj.  Oh, you know what?  I hear tell they're a sparks flying between those two.  They made a horrible mistake.  Oh, boy.  They did.  They made a horrible, horrible mistake.  Because it's not about the celebrity fucking faggot judges.  Exactly.  It's about...  Simon was brutal to people, but he was actually right. 
[01:46:00]  And the other ones were kind of an interesting mix, but not mainstream stars.  Nobody knew who Simon was before America's Nightmare.  But they knew Paula Abdul.  Kind of.  And...  Nah, she was famous.  But she was washed up.  She was washed up forever.  No one cared about her.  Not New York size.  Right.  There's a million washed up stars.  Right.  She came back.  I mean, they were taking a chance.  They were famous because of American Idol.  Now they're just trying to find famous people.  Mariah Carey's completely out of touch.  And Nicki Minaj with that...  And they're faking...  And they're faking...  And she does.  They're pretending to not like each other. 
[01:46:30]  You think it's pretend?  It's fake.  It's a fake storyline.  It's a fake storyline.  That's so stupid.  Like all those fucking reality shows.  Fake storylines.  I know fake fighting when I see it.  Oh, shit.  I'm an expert.  Give me some Jennifer Hudson.  Oh, wrestling.  I'm an expert.  That's true.  Cock sucker.  Fuck you.  Fuck you, Sam.  Bag of garbage.  Oh, shit.  Anything else from the inaugural before we move on?  Oh.  Nothing else?  Stands out.  That's it?  I think we covered most of it. 
[01:47:00]  We did all right with it.  Yeah.  Yeah, show this.  This Jennifer Hudson has a good voice.  That's not it.  That's my dance partner.  Dance partner.  Pardon.  He really does.  It's amazing.  She's right there.  There she is.  Just awkwardly singing at them.  That is awkward.  Look at all the phones everyone puts up.  That's like an Austin Powers moment or something.  Is that their wedding song or no?  It's the song he sang, right?  Oh, no.  I don't know.  What was the one he sang and everyone freaked out because he sang for three seconds? 
[01:47:30]  The house next door to me.  It was?  It was so, yeah.  Big David Allen co-fan.  Yes.  But she has to stand there awkwardly to sing to him.  She can't even perform with it because she'll interrupt their dance.  She's good.  Imagine if she cut in and just embarrassed them.  That'd be good.  Or if Obama went over there and stood down with her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You guys got a little red in them. 
[01:48:00]  Ooh.  Do you think he was nervous that everybody would see what a dork he is while he was dancing?  That's why he's only slow dancing.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got zero rhythm.  You see him just start boogieing down.  Yeah.  To some Tavares.  Do you think they're actually enjoying that moment?  No.  I think it's all business.  You think?  Yeah.  He's got so much shit to worry about.  Does he even have a...  You think he could clear his mind for one moment and have a dance like that with his wife?  You're the fucking king of the world right there. 
[01:48:30]  It's like, that's one of the only times you probably can enjoy it.  All you're expected to do is dance.  Yeah.  He gets like one day off from worrying about so much shit.  She really is good, right?  She's fucking doing some vocal acrobatics over there.  I gotta tell you.  You think she's the best singer alive?  Jennifer Hudson?  No.  Who's better?  Beyonce is better than Jennifer Hudson.  Beyonce.  I don't know about that.  Oh, look at you.  You're obsessed with Jay-Z.  You are.  How many albums has Jennifer Hudson sold?  It doesn't matter.  That doesn't mean anything. 
[01:49:00]  18?  I mean...  What just happened there?  She's a good singer.  She's not the best singer of a lot.  I don't think that fucking Beyonce was better than that, though.  Yeah.  She's very good, but she's not better than that.  I mean, there's a different song.  Let's have a showdown.  Right in this studio?  Let's have a showdown.  You heard it, Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson.  We're inviting you.  Open invite for the showdown of the century.  You think they'll come?  Yeah, because Opie and me are going to bet on it.  All right.  $10.  $10.  Get them in here for a $10 bet.  Yes.  And who judges?  Or we could have a part of WrestleMania.  That's right.  We'll do it at WrestleMania. 
[01:49:30]  The big sing-off.  That's right, Vince.  Make room.  Yeah, yeah.  Give us a singing contest.  Give us 10 minutes, Vince.  Give us 10 minutes.  We got $10 apiece.  We can handle this.  I don't think so.  Then we got this guy saying some things.  Who's that?  Just a guy named Danny Glover.  Oh, Danny Glover.  Mm-hmm.  He was upset about that.  The pens suck.  Oh, my God.  What happened to our good pens?  Where's our pens?  We used to have really good pens here.  That was the one thing I looked forward to. 
[01:50:00]  Why?  What's that?  They don't give us those really expensive pens anymore.  Well, then why don't we get them and tell them we want them?  What happened?  That's the only reason I came to work was to steal a good pen every once in a while.  That pen stinks.  They figured out a place they could cut some corners and save a little dough.  Liberty Media officially took over.  Did they?  Is that right?  I thought they had to wait 60 days.  That's what I thought.  But on the 18th, they took over.  Did they?  Mm-hmm.  You really?  Mm-hmm.  I did not know that.  Liberty Media said from now on, this place is bring your own pen.  Yep.  B-Y-O.  B-Y-O.  P.  I said B-Y-O.  I know.  Jim got it first. 
[01:50:30]  Jim got it first.  Yeah, but I was off mic.  I don't have a pen because I threw mine in the garbage.  That's right, Liberty Media.  I'm wasting these dog shit pens.  These pens are the worst.  They're fucking terrible.  Paper mate.  You know why?  Because they fuck your paper.  That's why they call it nice.  Shit.  It's horrible.  Paper mate pens.  Paper mate pens are fucking terrible.  I still have a Bic banana from the 70s.  I know, but it's shoved in your ass.  If you're a pen company, you can't have paper in the word. 
[01:51:00]  No.  No.  Exactly.  Paper mate.  That's what paper goes with.  The pen.  Let paper make paper and pens make pens.  No, it's paper's mate.  No, I get what they were trying to do, but it doesn't work.  It doesn't.  No.  Jimmy, what was wrong with the pen?  I'm just writing and it's fucking all crotchy.  Fucking crotchy.  Awful douche pen.  Wait, you got a good pen?  Yeah.  I want a good pen too.  Yeah, you got one.  These pens are fucking terrible.  You got to bring it up for the whole class.  Flip the fuck out.  I have enough for the whole class.  The astronauts use it in space. 
[01:51:30]  It still works.  Take the pen.  I want a new pen.  Flip out a little bit.  Here's the thing.  Yeah.  Chuck it.  First of all, you got to lose your mind.  I did.  I lost my mind years ago.  We have a box of these really awesome pens.  Good.  And every time I give someone one, it disappears.  Because I take them home.  Well, see, that's the problem.  I love them.  Oh, see.  I love a good pen.  Now.  I'm hoarding the good pens from around here.  That's why I stopped bringing the good ones in the studio and just thought, oh, I got  this one.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I lock my drawers so nobody takes them. 
[01:52:00]  All right, give me a good pen and watch.  I'll bring it back tomorrow.  No, you won't.  You're not going to bring it.  See, this is what you're doing.  Well, why don't we put it on a chain?  You're stealing office supplies.  It's called pilfering, yes.  It's frowned upon with new Liberty Media guys in charge.  Yeah, they don't like it.  Well, I guess we got...  Maybe next time I'll order, like, five boxes of the nice ones.  We should probably break, because Jason Statham's coming in in a few minutes.  Yep.  And then we can do the Danny Glover clip after he gets the hell out of here.  Is Danny Glover mad at something?  Second Amendment.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  He has theories.  Oh, wait, no, right?  He tells me he ain't for it. 
[01:52:30]  He's right.  It has nothing to do about...  He thinks the Second Amendment is the right to get a cab.  He's very angry about cabs still, I think.  He's in the outfield.  Yeah.  Statham is promoting a movie where he does some shit.  Does he drive?  Drives.  Does he shoot?  He fucking has a lot of energy.  Fights?  He does a lot of shooting and fighting.  What?  It's called Parker.  Car chases.  Speaks with an English accent?  A little bit.  He's got some of that MMA shit in here.  Banging bitches?  Banging the bitches. 
[01:53:00]  What else?  Drugs and shit?  Well, it's called...  Possibly some drugging.  Does he peel out in a car?  Does he peel out?  Peeling out.  Peeling out.  Jumping high and then falling?  That's right.  There's going to be some dead people in this movie.  Lopez is in it.  Does he do something cool to disarm somebody?  He sure does.  There's some high-jacket and shit.  It's going to be some kind of heist.  Is there a heist?  Yeah.  That's right, man.  Is there a caper?  Hey, man.  It's a Jason Statham movie.  I know.  It's not going to be a rom-com.  We all know that.  That's true.  It's called Parker. 
[01:53:30]  It opens January 25th and Jason Statham...  Hi.  Oh, this Friday it opens.  My name's Parker.  You said Lopez.  Lopez.  Oh.  Phew.  Oh.  I thought you knew something.  No, it's Jennifer Lopez.  You scared me.  I would never see a movie with Mario Lopez.  No, you would.  A Saved by the Bell deal?  Hell no.  Only if it was like really a drama, Saved by the Bell.  They were all together, but somebody gets killed.  He's got the gay voice.  That'd be good.  He's got the gay voice.  But he's married.  He's got the gay face.  And the voice.  We have a great show tomorrow, too. 
[01:54:00]  Huh?  Yes.  What is going on tomorrow?  It's a big one.  Yeah.  50 Cent.  Fiddy?  Yeah.  Yo, Fiddy.  This'll be fun.  Is Who Kid coming in for that one?  I hope so.  It's their pals.  Yeah.  Well, boss and worker.  Right.  More than pals.  He associated his relationship with 50 Cent like Obie's relationship with Sal.  Oh, boy.  In the sense that 50 Cent hates Who Kid.  Oh, my God.  But he's his boss.  He does?  What are you saying?  Hey, is that Jason Statham right there? 
[01:54:30]  Is he here already?  Yeah.  That's Jason Statham.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  He's probably doing someone else for us because he went that way.  All right.  So we're going to have Jason Statham next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Behind the rubber.  He's got to go behind.  He did not go behind the rubber.  For me, he did.  He did not go behind the rubber.  You did not.  Oh, I ain't listening to him, Eddie.  That's the hell.  That's bullshit.  Behind the rubber. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, bullshit.  Bullshit yourself.  You're here and this crew is here just to fuck us.  Ha.  Yeah.  Boom.  Good.  That's great.  And you shot me.  Ah, you shit.  You should be late to get me out of here.  Oh, Earl.  You run yourself, Earl.  You run yourself.  Get your finger off of me.  You hit me.  Yeah, because you put your finger on me.  I'm glad you hit me.  That's right.  You're here for one goddamn pacific reason.  What's that, Earl?  To fuck us.  Ah, you're full of shit. 
[01:55:30]  Fuck you.  Goddamn years and years.  And don't you ever put your finger on me.  You hit me, Earl.  You put your finger on me.  That's okay.  Goddamn right.  If you touch the right.  I didn't.  You ain't gonna knock nobody on his ass.  You do it again and I'll knock you right in your nose.  I didn't touch it.  You put your finger on me.  I did not.  No, you're lying.  Goddamn it.  You're lying.  No, you are.  You are a liar.  You're a big liar if you can't.  You are a liar, Earl.  You are.  I'm a liar.  You are.  I'll tell you something. 
[01:56:00]  You're here for one reason to fuck us good.  Wrong.  That's the only reason you're here.  You are wrong, Earl.  And you'll have your chance tomorrow.  Aw.  You got it as quick as you can.  What is wrong with you?  You ain't no good.  No, you aren't either.  You aren't either.  You ain't no good.  You're no fucking good either.  Your ass will never have our games today.  I hope.  What do I care?  Yeah, what do I care?  What are you doing here now?  Well, why don't you call the league office and ask him?  Yeah, I will.  Oh, good.  Don't think I won't.  Good.  And the quicker you get on, it'll be better too. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's right.  You ain't going nowhere.  You aren't either.  You look for five, ten fucking years to know who's in the Hall of Fame.  Oh, you're going to be in the Hall of Fame.  You know it.  Why?  You know it.  We're fucking up World Series?  You know it.  You're going to be in the Hall of Fame.  You know it.  I've won more than I've lost, kid.  I know you haven't, Earl.  Games count games.  You don't even know what I'm going to say.  You better get going, Earl.  I better get going.  You better get going.  What the hell are you going to do? 
[01:57:00]  Tell me a group that you had your hands on me.  No, that's wrong, Earl.  Wrong.  Wrong.  I love that clip.  Earl Weaver, of course, lost him over the weekend.  Hopefully, we'll find him soon.  Oh, see, because...  One of the greats.  You can't yell at umpires like that anymore.  No.  Now they'll take you personally and kick you out of the game right away.  That's it.  How great is that clip?  Is that your tweet where you said you were going to fill up his grave with umpires just 
[01:57:30]  kicking dead enough?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's pretty good.  Just invite all those fucking guys.  Yeah, I want a Pop-Tart.  Should have bought them.  What do you mean?  I bought a Pop-Tart.  Now I get a Pop-Tart.  Did I say that?  Damn it!  Give it to me!  We have unfrosted Pop-Tarts back there, don't we?  I don't fuck with unfrosted.  Oh, that's right.  He is a child.  That's right.  Pushing 40 and he's fucking still eating like a little kid.  Did anyone watch the big football games? 
[01:58:00]  I went to a house to watch football.  I was the only one watching football.  Really?  Well, me and Ange.  What was going on?  What the fudge?  Me and Ange.  Am I allowed to say your name on the air?  I forgot.  You already did.  Okay, E-Rock's wife.  E-Rock's wife and me were watching football.  Everyone else was in the other room like Kvetching.  Sam and his lovely bride.  Jess.  My wife and E-Rock all Kvetching.  I'm sitting there trying to get everyone involved in these football games.  They're exciting. 
[01:58:30]  I wasn't Kvetching.  Somebody had to watch your kid.  Oh, yeah.  That's true, boy.  I was playing with little Opie all day.  I was too busy watching football.  I couldn't give him attention.  Patriots lost again.  I hear the Pats lost.  Yeah, Brady's not as great as a lot of people think.  He needs one more, man.  He needs one more Super Bowl and he can't get it.  No.  So that's it.  And he got fucked in two Super Bowls with the amazing fucking helmet catch.  And what was the other big fucking play that knocked him down? 
[01:59:00]  All right, right.  So he should maybe have at least one more Super Bowl win.  That would give him the most.  That would tie him for the most.  How did they look?  Was it a blowout or close?  Nah, what was the final score there?  I forget already.  What was their problem?  A couple days ago.  What was their problem?  They just kind of didn't, you know, make the big plays when they needed them.  Yeah.  See, I could do sports talk.  They couldn't make the big plays.  28-13.  Did they not capitalize on opportunities? 
[01:59:30]  They didn't capitalize.  On the opportunities, yes.  The ball didn't bounce their way.  Oh, man.  No.  Yeah, huh?  They just couldn't get it done.  But did they have their game face on?  They definitely had their game face on.  Did they come to play?  They definitely came to play.  They left it all on the field.  I think they left it all on the field.  Oh, that's good.  I like hearing that.  And then Ray Lewis.  I know Travis is a huge Ravens fan, but just Ray Lewis.  Jesus.  Making it about himself.  Is he?  Oh, God, yeah.  Is this Jason Statham?  We can talk about football after Statham. 
[02:00:00]  That is.  Bring him in.  Jason Statham is here promoting Parker.  That's a real star right there.  The big movie opens this Friday.  All right, Jason.  Hey, Jason.  It's been a while, brother.  How are you, sir?  Take a seat, Jason Statham.  Where have you been since I came on in?  Where have you been?  We're still here.  Good years, I think.  Take a seat.  How you been?  Good.  Yeah, why not?  Oh, you don't have to shake his hand, but all right.  He's just a lower class plebe. 
[02:00:30]  You know what?  We haven't seen you in a while, but you're still making a lot of great movies, sir.  Yes.  Praise the Lord.  You are a working actor, man.  I am.  That's for sure.  Well, seems to keep going.  Yeah.  When you need somebody that needs to drive a car really fucking fast and cool and grab  guns and shoot people.  Right.  And I like the way you disarm people, too.  I like that.  And all of a sudden, they're like, what happened?  I had a gun.  Where is it now?  Jason Statham took my gun. 
[02:01:00]  It's all about a sound effect.  Yes.  Oh, what happened?  She had the gun.  She had the jump on Jason and everything.  But Jimmy's about to say that Jason smells really good, aren't you?  You want to say it.  You want to say it.  I did think it.  You want to say it.  Come on, guys.  We're all fucking fellas.  I know, right?  But he's got good.  It's a very manly cologne.  It's good.  We're talking guns and you're talking perfume.  Not perfume, cologne.  But me and Jimmy find our new colognes when you guys come in.  Yeah.  I got the one with the bottle that goes.  There you go.  Everything makes a sound effect, which is it. 
[02:01:30]  How much cologne did you put on that I could smell it over here?  I made a mistake on the plane.  I was sitting next to some guy on a plane and he smelled really good.  So I said, what are you wearing?  You smell really good.  He goes, well, I don't have cologne on.  So it was fucking humiliating.  That's my smelly asshole.  He has my sweat.  Been enjoying your pheromones, mister.  Jesus Christ.  Well, we already promoted Parker.  It sounds like it's going to be a good movie.  This Friday it opens.  Yeah.  Very cool.  So what's the gist here? 
[02:02:00]  The gist.  Okay.  Well, the good thing is it's based on a series of books written by Donald Westlake,  a man from New York.  I think he was born in Brooklyn.  Really?  Brooklyn.  Uh, he's, um, yeah, he's, he's written a series of novels previously played by, well,  one of them was played by Lee Marvin, a film called Point Blank.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  And then Mel Gibson did a movie called Payback.  So, he's, uh, you know, it comes from a good stock.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a good pedigree.  And, you know, he's a crime writer, mystery writer. 
[02:02:30]  Uh, and so it's, uh, it's a tale of, you know, a couple of robberies.  One goes wrong.  They screw me out of my money.  Bastards.  Bastards.  Uh, and then the story takes us to Palm Beach and, you know, I have to use a cunning plan  to try and fool these fools that turn me over.  Okay.  So, uh, with that, uh, I have to, you know, team up with, uh, Jennifer Lopez, which is  a lovely deal.  All right.  A little J-Lo action there, huh?  Yes, sir.  You see that ace?  We saw her ass once. 
[02:03:00]  See that ace?  She walked by here once.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a big day for us, Jason.  Mars liked it.  Yeah.  Yeah, he really liked it.  Some nice boot tag.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How come you never do a movie where you just, you commit a crime with a bunch of guys and  then you go, all right, take care, and everybody just goes home.  They split it evenly.  There's no backstabbing.  Two for you, two for me.  Three for you, three for me.  Two for you.  Pleasure doing business with you all.  The end.  We speak terrible partners.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:03:30]  Stupid.  Your judgment is terrible as far as picking crime partners.  We've got to have bullicles.  You've got to have an intervention with you.  It really is.  I've got it.  How adept are you to weaponry?  Are you good?  Like, you handle it?  Because you use them in enough movies.  Yeah, I'm good with a butter knife.  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever it takes, man.  Knitting needles.  Do you enjoy shooting?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I've spent a lot of time over the years, you know, fighting around in action films.  And with that, you need to know what you're doing.  So, you know, you go and learn how to do that properly. 
[02:04:00]  So, we've shot almost every weapon and driven every car.  And, you know, I think it's a great perk of the job to be able to learn the skills and, you know, get the opportunity to do this kind of thing.  I know they got, like, stuntmen and stuff for some of the car action.  But do you know how to do that thing where you're going in reverse really fast and you just swing it around and now you're going forward?  But you can do that.  Yeah.  Fucking cool.  You know, you learn that on a big skid pad. 
[02:04:30]  Right, right.  You go out of town.  Nothing to hit.  You don't learn it on the high street.  That's so I fucking burped off.  Well, what's the move?  What do you do?  You're going in reverse real fast.  No, I know.  I know.  But what do you actually do when you're behind the steering wheel?  You've got to put your arm out and signal.  Or if you're a fossil.  Put your blinker on.  Make sure no one's coming.  Mirror.  Signal maneuver.  Exactly.  10 o'clock, 2 o'clock.  Let's be safe, guys.  But it's cool as hell, but it seems like it is a very simple maneuver.  It's a very simple maneuver.  You could learn that in, you know, a couple of hours. 
[02:05:00]  Really?  Very easy.  You hit the brakes and do what at the same time?  Well, it depends.  There's two kinds of cars.  There's a manual.  There's one with a gear stick.  Right.  Which I prefer because I grew up doing that.  Automatics only came in front of me when I came to the States.  Yeah, yeah.  In the UK, everyone learns with a manual shift.  So it's very different.  You have to, you know, what would you like to do it in?  I used to like it.  I can't drive a stick, though.  I used to love driving a stick.  You are not a man if you can't drive a stick. 
[02:05:30]  A stick is the thing.  I know, but my other hand is busy.  Yeah, it's great.  Every limb is flying.  I used to love my Honda Accord that had a stick.  I loved it, though.  But the stupid SUVs don't have the stick.  So, you know, I miss it.  I like to have a free hand.  I do.  I like to relax.  Relax your one arm.  Yeah, I do.  Your clutch foot.  Yeah.  It's too much work.  It's half your body getting all worked out, and the other side's all getting all flabby.  You never used a stick, ever? 
[02:06:00]  I did once when I was drunk.  I loved it.  We stole my friend's Volkswagen.  I was like 15.  But I kept it in first.  Oh, my God.  You couldn't find second, huh?  They're cool.  They run out.  They're cool.  You know, the guys running next to you.  Hey, you want to pull over?  Yeah.  I can't believe you're telling Jason Statham you were in first gear the whole way.  Well, what am I going to do?  At least I have some bonding point.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, that's true.  I've also chosen lousy friends, obviously.  You've got to start somewhere.  Right?  You can build from there.  So, which is easier to do that turn in, an automatic or a stick? 
[02:06:30]  For me, a stick.  Okay.  But it's, you know.  All right.  So, you're flying backwards.  Then what happens?  Then you're flying backwards.  Yep.  So, then you put in the clutch.  Right.  You spin the wheel.  Jam the brake to get some momentum as you come to a certain point in the trajectory of the turn.  Right.  And then you flip the wheel back the other way.  Put it into, obviously, first of all, you're going in reverse.  Right.  Yeah.  So, you put in the, as you're going backwards, you slam the wheel, put in the clutch. 
[02:07:00]  Into neutral.  As you come around to the certain mark on the trajectory.  I thought you said this was easy.  Put it straight.  This was easy.  You're slipping it into, into second or third.  Right.  Depending on how fast you want to do the maneuver.  Yeah.  You don't want to go in first.  And then you're straight in the car and away you go.  That's so cool.  And that's something that, like, Secret Service guys and all those body, like, they all have to learn how to do that.  Can you flip the car if you do it wrong?  Uh, not really.  I mean, it's tough.  If you've got, the SUVs are not too clever. 
[02:07:30]  You know, they're a little bit top heavy.  Uh-huh.  So, if you're in a, you know, if you're in a sports car or something, that's pretty.  Low center of gravity, yeah.  What's the most dangerous thing you've done in, uh, your movies?  Because, obviously, you have a lot of stuntmen, but I'm sure you do some things here and there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, I had a fight.  So, I did a movie called Crank.  Oh, yeah.  That's when you were in last.  A long time ago.  And, uh, yeah, we did a particular stunt that they wouldn't allow me to do, uh, during the, you know, the making of the movie.  They said, you can do it, but it has to be on the last day of filming. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, shit.  We don't care about you.  We care about the movie.  Yeah, right, right, right.  Insurance said that.  Yeah, yeah.  It was the movie first, so we have something to sell.  So, anyway, um, that was a particular stunt that, um, I have to stand on the, there's two skis on the, uh, on the, you know, on the helicopter.  And I had to stand on one of them.  Oof.  Uh, and there's a little hip pick with a very small, thin wire that attaches you to, you know, the middle of the, uh, helicopter in case you do fall. 
[02:08:30]  And you can just dangle there and they can lower you to the ground somewhere.  Uh, but, you know, this is 3,000 feet up and you don't want to be dangling and being laid down anyway.  So, um, you know, it's, uh, we had to take off from one of the tall buildings in downtown L.A.  And, you know, as much as you like to mentally prepare yourself for that, there is no experience to the, uh, you know, to the sound and the, uh, the buffeting of the, the, the chopper.  And, you know, you're outside and then on top of that, you have to do a fight sequence. 
[02:09:00]  So, um, yeah, you just have to focus on, on what you're doing and.  Fuck that.  Yeah, you have to really overcome that, uh, adrenaline rush.  And it's like, you know, the legs like a fucking sewing machine.  Yeah.  And you wanted to do that.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Could you hang outside a helicopter, you think?  I couldn't sit in one.  With a wire?  No.  I couldn't sit in one.  No, you're lucky you get me on a fucking plane.  I just closed the windows.  No, you wouldn't want a helicopter.  I like to think I could.  I don't know that.  That's balls, man. 
[02:09:30]  That is balls.  But then you have to fight, too, on top of it.  But, you know, it's, there's great reward with something.  If you're testing yourself and you're pushing yourself, you finish and you live.  Right.  The important thing is you live.  Right, right.  But, and, you know, it's, uh, it's, what's the worst thing that can happen?  You know, it's, uh.  Plummet to your death?  Yeah, you think about, you think about all that money you're losing as you fall.  Yeah, boy, that sucks.  That wire snap.  Dude, I'm amazed with these guys that do this because Cruz does his own stuff, too.  And they let him do the Mission Impossible 4, uh, on the, on the outside of the Burge Tower. 
[02:10:00]  And I'm like, how do you get the insurance coverage for a star of your magnitude or his magnitude  to do something like that?  I don't know how you get that.  And we saw, uh, him sitting on top of that thing, but they never used it in the movie.  It was a promo shop.  To be fair, all that big, spectacular stuff isn't that fucking difficult.  It's just, you just have to have a, you know, a good set of balls.  You have to have balls.  And that's it.  Right.  I mean, there's hundreds of people, thousands that could do that quite easily. 
[02:10:30]  The more difficult stuff is the skill-related stuff.  Yeah.  You know, the fighting or the, where you have to do something that, you know, requires a certain agility  and a certain calculation of time and speed.  Yeah, it's all...  That stuff's hard.  The other stuff, you can strap your granny in there and swing her out, you know.  It's, uh, it's...  The timing issues with the fights are, you could really hurt somebody, right?  That stuff is a whole new world.  The other stuff, you just go, okay, well, you know, I've got two safety wires or whatever it is. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  It ain't hard.  And then also, a lot of stuff, um, with CGI, you know, you're just in front of a green screen dangling or something.  But those fight sequences, yeah, you've got to be in the right place at the right time.  Are you getting a friggin' fist in your face or...  Yeah, that's, you know, I feel that they're a lot more...  You can't just get anybody to do that stuff, you know.  That's why I've always looked up to people like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan.  And they're the inspiration.  They really are, because they are...  Jackie Chan does everything, you know, and... 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  They're just...  They have such a great skill set.  That's a great point.  It really is a great point.  Yeah.  Because we're scared of heights, so we just think hanging outside a building is scary.  You should take skill.  You see all those old pictures of people who used to...  When they're building the things in New York.  Oh, yeah, and they're on the I-beams.  Yeah.  On the I-beams.  I mean...  And no safety back then at all.  Eating bologna, drinking vodka.  Jesus.  And animals.  And drinking vodka.  And just throwing hot shit at each other.  Yeah.  Hot rivets.  Yeah, here's a rivet. 
[02:12:00]  You wouldn't have to dangle millions in front of them to do that, Joe.  No.  No.  I don't know.  That was some low-wage shit to climb all the way up there.  You're right.  Was that a photo op, or you think they ate their lunch up there?  I don't know, man.  My famous picture.  I heard that that was a real photo.  I need to know.  You think they ate their lunch like that every day?  Come on.  Amazing, right?  Or one day they said, let's just fucking do this for the photo.  Maybe that, yeah.  Hanging by one foot from a hook, just eating a sandwich.  Which every day is some other stunt.  I pissed so much.  They would hate me.  You guys, fellas, let's go.  I'd be on the end. 
[02:12:30]  Slide in, slide in.  Aren't you a kickboxer, too, though?  My dad was a boxer.  I've done a lot of martial arts.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  So for you, it's probably a little bit easier, because you're a skilled fighter.  Well, I wouldn't.  I mean, there's levels.  I mean, I'm a massive fan of MMA.  Yeah.  And K-1.  And, you know, pretty much anything that involves a bit of, you know, one-to-one combat.  But I always get behind them.  You know, these are, they are the real deal.  For me, they are something that, you know, what we try and do, we try and, you know, emulate 
[02:13:00]  the aspects of what they can do.  But they, you know, I work with Randy Couture.  He's, you know, one of the toughest men on the planet.  Was he 49 now or 48?  He's fucking, he's amazing.  Yeah.  I mean, he's like, just, he's won so many titles.  And in a sport where people will, you know, they're coming to hurt you.  Yeah.  We got a couple of the guys coming in tomorrow.  There ain't no cart, cart, can I hurt my elbow?  There's none of that in that sport.  We got Jon Jones coming in tomorrow. 
[02:13:30]  And Chael Sonnen, yeah.  And Chael Sonnen.  And Chael, yeah.  Please, I love Jon Jones.  He's, uh.  With those elbows?  Yeah, he's.  He punches with his elbows.  Yes.  How fucked up is that?  Stop that.  Yeah, that's got a sting.  Yeah, they are.  He comes in here every once in a while and just hurts us.  Or hurts Jimmy.  Yeah, I always get them to do something.  It's fun just to experience it, you know.  It fucking hurts.  Yeah.  A lot.  Choked out Bob Kelly.  Yeah, Bob's an obese friend of ours.  Yeah.  The most impressive thing was that he got his arms around Bob. 
[02:14:00]  So, uh, do you go to the fights?  Do you go to them?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I haven't been for a while.  It's, um, you know, running around.  It's always trying to get to the fight that you want to go to.  And, you know, sometimes timing ain't on your side.  Did you get discovered by, uh, Guy Ritchie?  Is that how you got into films?  You were modeling and you met Guy Ritchie?  No, I used to, I used to sell perfume and jewelry.  My dad was at a mock auction, a ram shop, as they call it.  Uh, and then, uh, my brother used to do what I do.  And I used to sell, you know, fake perfume and jewelry outside Harrods. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, really?  That's what I used to do.  Ever since I left school, that was my job.  I left at 15 and I never worked for anybody apart from myself.  And I did that right up until the point I met Guy Ritchie.  Holy shit.  How much money were you, uh, pulling down?  Yeah, you get, I don't know, a couple of grand on a good day.  Pounds, pound notes, which for, uh, you know, 16, 17 year olds is not too bad.  Right.  Wow.  Um, you know, I'd have a few stooges in the crowd and it was, uh, for me, it was, it was  entertainment for my own self as much as it was for the crowd. 
[02:15:00]  A few stooges in the crowd.  It was about, you know, four or five of us used to go to work and then we'd work, you  know, the markets back in the day were, um, were a very fruitful thing in the UK.  You know, the market trade was not the markets that everybody, people think, you know, we  talk about the stock markets.  Right, right.  Street markets.  It's, uh, like a culture back, back in the UK from the, you know, let's say the eighties  all the way up until sort of the late nineties, well, the mid nineties.  And then it just sort of faded away. 
[02:15:30]  Uh, but yeah, it was a good living and I never saw myself doing anything else.  And then Guy Ritchie wrote a, uh, a film called Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  And one of those characters was a street corner con man who used to sell jewelry out of a briefcase.  And I said, I've done that for the last 20 years.  How did you actually meet like that?  Well, there was a, a, an investor for the movie.  I knew his wife.  She put me in a room with him.  Um, just, wow.  What a, that's just chance. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  He said, you don't need, I said, look, I'm not a fucking actor.  And he says, you don't need to act.  He says, say these words.  Just say these words.  I say the words and I'll film it.  And that'll be the end of it.  It's literally just like that.  Oh shit.  That's great.  Yeah.  It was, he simplified the whole thing.  And I said, do I need to go to acting school?  And he said, don't fuck around with that.  No.  He says, they'll turn you into something that you're not.  Right.  Right.  That's just the opposite of how things have gone for me.  I've showed up and they went, you're not an actor. 
[02:16:30]  Jimmy.  Wow.  There's a lot of luck there.  That's yeah.  But to be in the right place at the right time and then delivering.  But then obviously, but obviously you got the talent and the skill because you continue.  But I mean, who was to know that, you know, I mean, I was okay playing that particular  guy because I knew that world and I knew the language and I knew everything about what  he was asking me to do.  But it didn't mean to say that I was going to do it, you know, play Parker with Taylor  Hackford and Jennifer.  Right.  Right.  Is it a dangerous world doing what you were doing?  No, no.  Not really? 
[02:17:00]  Not dangerous.  It's illegal.  You know, it's police.  But they kind of look the other way, right?  They don't want to deal with that shit.  No, they don't look the other way.  At all.  You can go to prison for it.  Yeah.  You're outside of Harrods, right?  That's a big place.  Yeah, because it depends how aggressive you are with what you're selling.  If you're misrepping what you're selling, if you're saying this is solid gold, then the  trading standards are up and then you're up in court and you screw yourself.  So you have to be cunning and clever with how you word what you're selling.  You ever get caught?  Huh?  You ever get caught?  No. 
[02:17:30]  So far.  I know a lot of people that did, but they were really, you know, they were sticking it.  Pushing it.  Yeah.  So you would just, I'm amazed by that.  You would just kind of like gather people around and like gather a crowd just by loudly  talking and they would stand around.  Have you ever seen a pitcher in the street?  It's not street pitching, you know?  It's amazing.  You create a crowd by telling them they're going to get something that they don't necessarily  want.  You know, it's like you're playing to their greed.  Everyone's a greedy fucker deep down.  And if you think you're going to get something for nothing, you're going to be standing in 
[02:18:00]  there, you know, putting out your money.  That's a great opening line for a movie, by the way.  Everyone's a greedy fucker deep down.  It's a great opening line to a fucking movie.  In my neighborhood, we got coat guys.  They come with a coat rack out of nowhere.  It's two of them.  They set up on a corner really quick and they start selling coats for like 50 bucks a pop.  And you could see how intense it is because the one guy's looking around waiting to see  if a cop's going to show up and they're selling as fast as they fucking can and getting out 
[02:18:30]  of there.  It's crazy.  I love to ask for their permits.  They really hate that.  Oh, man.  But man, they sell.  No one gives a fuck that it's stolen merchandise.  In this case, it's absolutely stolen merchandise.  Oh, yeah.  Did you ever consider yourself like, well, I could be an action hero, an action star.  Well, selling jewelry in the street.  Right, right.  When am I going to be able to do it?  Now, there's no relationship to doing films or being in action films.  Even when you did the first movie, did you think like, oh, I could be an action film star? 
[02:19:00]  No.  No, huh?  No.  But I always had a desire to be a stuntman when I was a kid.  Okay, yeah.  You know, I did a lot of physical stuff and that was what I wanted to be.  I thought I could throw myself around and do stupid things and people might pay me for  that.  Right, right.  And I had a friend who I used to train with who was on the stunt register and he used to  get work and he said, yeah, it's great.  You can, you know, that is what I wanted to do.  And then there was an unrealistic side of that. 
[02:19:30]  And then years and years later, I met Guy and then, you know, I was in the movies and  then by chance I ended up doing a film for a French filmmaker called Luc Besson.  And that meeting turned me into just, you know, doing action films because he gave me a part  where I could do all the silly stuff that I'd learned to do as a kid.  So when you watch your own movies, because some people don't, you've seen all your movies. 
[02:20:00]  I think it's going to be okay.  Some you know is just not worth watching.  But are you, do you think you're watching it differently from other people?  Because other people see like, oh fuck, there's badass Jason Statham and he's kicking ass and  taking names and fucking driving like a maniac.  Do you watch it like, oh my God, I feel silly because that's not me.  Yeah, of course.  I mean, but there's certain things that you'd like to see.  You know, you get in there with, you know, Stallone and, you know. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, right.  I did a movie with the big hitters called Expendables.  Yes.  So, you know, I grew up watching those people.  So things like that, you know.  That must have been a fucking trip.  You're a big star, but were you intimidated?  Huh?  You're obviously a big star, but were you intimidated in that situation, working with  those guys?  You know what, I meant to, I went to meet Sly for a lunch and he's just, he's the real  deal.  So he doesn't come with, you know, you're going to be working for me. 
[02:21:00]  This is the way it's going to go.  He's right.  He just makes everyone feel relaxed.  You know, he's, he's just a regular dude really deep down.  Wow.  Yeah.  I've heard that from a few people that have said that.  He's fucking funny as well.  Yeah.  He really is.  Well, we've never had the opportunity to speak with him.  On the phone with Dave.  We interviewed him on the phone.  Oh, that's right.  I wasn't in that day.  We had him on once.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was nice.  Yeah.  He's great.  He's one of those guys who doesn't need to prove who he is.  I mean, he doesn't need to make you know that he's Stallone because he knows who he's  Stallone.  I'm just guessing.  I've never met him. 
[02:21:30]  It's always good when some idiot pontificates about something he has no idea what he's talking  about.  It's good.  Good speech on Stallone, shithead.  Jason is promoting Parker and it's, you know, your stuff is always very fast moving, man.  It's like, you really, you can't piss during a Jason Statham movie.  It's like, what happened?  I don't know.  There's a different cast and half of them are dead.  I fucking got for three minutes.  Why is he running fast?  I don't know.  If he stops, he's a dead person.  He's on a plane. 
[02:22:00]  A new cast.  That's fucking funny.  He doesn't even have time to eat.  Yeah.  But they seem like fun movies to do, though.  It's like, there's probably nothing boring about doing the fucking films you do.  Yeah, exactly.  They are.  There's always a, there's an element of, you know, joy to that shit.  Yeah, yeah, I guess.  Wow.  You know, I've done films that are a bit less, you know, slower in pace, but the action  stuff is fun.  They're so much fun to watch, man.  I mean, you know, talk about immersing yourself in a fantasy world. 
[02:22:30]  Like, you know, obviously you'd probably be dead within the first five minutes of any  movie you're in, in reality.  It's so silly.  But how you get out of a lot of the shit is just fucking classic.  Yeah.  It's really cool.  Have you ever had a moment, I know they tell us we have to wrap with you, but where  you're watching yourself on, like, a premiere or something, and not even an action scene,  but there's something that you do in the movie where you're like, oh, like, have you ever  had like a, just an uncomfortable moment watching yourself?  That's why you want to be able to bond with them again, Jim?  No.  I'm wondering what it's like to not have that moment. 
[02:23:00]  Every time I talk on film, I'm just like, oh, the movie stinks.  It stinks.  Oh, it's better.  Now I'm away.  The weird thing, you try and, you know, if it's going to be a bad film and you just,  you just think, what's the point in watching it?  Or even a good movie with a bad moment, or not even a bad moment, just a moment that  you feel like, oh, fuck, I should have done that different.  I knew that it wasn't going to...  Yeah, I think if you're patting yourself on the back when you're watching a film, there's  something deep, deeply wrong.  Right. 
[02:23:30]  There are psychotics that love their own movies.  No.  There are people that can watch their own movies.  Like, could you gather friends to watch your work?  I could never gather friends to watch my work.  You could gather friends.  Exactly.  Try that first, Jim.  Yeah.  Would you take a stab at that one, Jim?  Yeah, exactly.  All right, well, I'm glad we...  Oh, it's good.  Destroyed Jimmy here.  Well, I am.  This movie's going to be another success.  Yeah, I really love Jason Statham movies.  Absolutely.  A lot of fun.  Parker opens Friday, right?  It opens Friday, and, you know, do we really need to promote it? 
[02:24:00]  Probably not.  It's going to be in every theater, and, you know, they're all fucking great.  Very cool.  And they're always popular.  Jason, thanks so much for coming in.

[02:36:00]  He was very open and honest with us, too.  When's the last time we played that Fifty Shades of Gay bit?  It's been a while now.  We don't play that a lot.  I think the beginning of last week.  Yeah, we don't play it a lot.  E-Rock.  The beginning of last week.  Holy shit, do we play it a lot?  E-Rock.  Yeah, and everyone else complains about everything possible.  I'm just saying.  Oh, shit.  It's the new I Don't Care Rock.  I like him.  That's right.  I like him.  I just tweeted my best photobomb ever.  That is a good one.  I might have thrown my hip out, but it still is my best photobomb ever. 
[02:36:30]  It is a perfect shot.  I was trying to get a picture with, of course, Jason Statham.  The great Jason Statham.  The great Jason Statham.  And it's the usual next-to-each-other picture.  So, right when the camera snapped, Opie kicked his foot up in a high kick, which completely  obscures Jason Statham's face, where you wouldn't even know he was standing there.  I am posing with a picture of Opie's sneaker with Jason Statham behind it. 
[02:37:00]  I could never do that again.  No.  That is like luck.  It's perfect.  God, why doesn't my luck work out where I win the lottery?  There's no way.  The timing on that, and I don't think I could get my foot up that high.  The lottery, perfect foot picture, whatever.  Either one.  Yeah.  Either or.  Yeah, because it had to go right when the shutter clicked.  Your foot's only up there for a split second.  True.  And it's exactly in front of Jason Statham's face.  He ruined my Jason Statham picture. 
[02:37:30]  And then I got a nice little, my picture's nice.  It's a good one.  No one photobombed my shot.  Very nice.  This place, it's very rare if you get a picture with a celebrity without some idiot doing something.  Oh, my God.  Today, I'm the idiot.  Yes, I know.  Who was you photobombing everybody?  Dominic Monaghan?  Yeah, Dominic Monaghan.  Yeah.  From Lord of the Rings.  Wow.  You photobombed everybody.  I got them.  Perfectly, too.  Perfect.  Erox was great.  Was it Erox, the one where you were right in the middle?  Yeah.  And you were just making faces?  Rollins, I fucked up pretty good. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  I Twittered all, and I was so proud of myself.  Yeah, it was very good.  He was a very good interviewer, too.  Very good photobombing.  He was great, man.  Terrific interview.  Yes.  And tomorrow, we got 50 Cent, and we got...  Fiddy.  Fiddy.  John Jones and Chael Sonnen.  I cannot wait.  Yes.  Never interviewed Chael.  Maybe you go for...  I didn't see that.  Jimmy's fucking...  You photobombing.  I got Ant pretty good, too.  I love that one.  You're just sitting like a retard in a chair next to my picture.  And then, you know, which one is this? 
[02:38:30]  Travis's...  Travis's...  Where do they go to see these?  My Twitter.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's Twitter?  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  It's not too far down in your feed?  No, no.  Go to Jim Norton on Twitter to check it out.  Wow.  Perfect.  Iraq likes leaning the head in on those pictures.  Yeah.  Like, every one of them's Lindsay Lohan.  It's like a fat pumpkin.  Big head.  And who was the last one?  I think you might have got Roland, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  Roland.  Roland.  Oh, you got everybody.  Yeah.  You're in the back.  You really fucked everyone's pictures up. 
[02:39:00]  That's great.  It's perfect.  It's on our Facebook page, too, I'm sure.  Or it will be.  It's going up right now.  Opie and Andy.  Erox is my favorite.  Yeah.  Yeah, Erox is a good one because you're framed perfectly.  You look like you're photoshopped into it.  Yeah, that looks fake.  It does look fake.  Yeah, like, how would you get Jim in this same picture?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  I guess we did the football with the Ravens and the Ray Lewis, right?  Didn't we have some audio we were going to play of...  Oh, no.  I know what I have.  Who was it?  Yeah, we have that, but we have this really fast. 
[02:39:30]  So, you got this guy, Welker.  He plays for the Patriots.  Does he have a make-believe girlfriend?  He doesn't.  Look at his real girlfriend.  Holy Toledo.  Blabbermouth wife.  Oh, is she a loudmouth?  You don't like it?  Keep your fucking wives off Facebook, athletes.  No.  Tony, shut the fuck up.  Well, I'm not a fan of Ray Lewis grandstanding his way through the fucking season.  Yeah?  There's other people playing for the Ravens.  Holy fuck. 
[02:40:00]  Is he, like, making himself what it's all about?  Well, I don't want to piss off Travis, because he's a big Ravens fan.  Oh, then don't talk about heterosexual sex.  But Ray Lewis is...  Piss him off because he's gay.  Ray Lewis is really making it about himself big time.  Did you see what he did after the game?  No.  He fell down on the ground, and he was talking to the turf,  and then, of course, every single camera person was focused on him  and what he was doing, even though it was a great game for Flacco  and Harbo and the rest of the guys.  Zeppo.  Zeppo, right.  Groucho. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Hatco.  It's a hat company.  I know it's his last year.  Yes.  I know it's his last year, but he's grandstanding.  Yeah.  And no one's calling him out on it.  They all think it's great.  Yeah.  I bet you Travis would say it's great.  I bet you he would.  Keep him seeing if he's going to run down the hall.  Maybe he won't.  All right.  He's not paying attention.  Who do you got in the Super Bowl?  Niners or the Ravens there?  Me?  In the big game.  In the big game. 
[02:41:00]  I got to go with the Niners.  I'm going Niners.  You got to go with the Niners.  I'm going Niners.  Yeah.  Because Covino loves the Niners.  Yeah.  Wait, Rich and Covino?  Covino and Rich?  Covino and Rich.  Which one do I know?  Rich.  Oh, and I said Covino?  Do I know Covino or Rich?  I just think it's...  Rich is from the morning mashup.  It's the same Rich.  Oh, that's that guy?  There's only one Rich.  I thought his name was Rich Covino.  No.  His name is Rich David.  So the guy I know is Covino and he was very wealthy and they just bragged about it.  Travis?  Yeah?  I didn't get it.  Rich?  Breathe before you answer this question. 
[02:41:30]  Breathe before you answer this question.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Because I know you're a super fan.  I know you're a super fan.  Swallow it.  But I want you to be honest.  Complete honesty.  Okay.  Is Ray Lewis grandstanding, in your honest opinion, Travis?  No, he's the greatest.  Oh, God.  No, he's not.  No, he's the greatest.  Why?  That's ridiculous.  That's how he's always been.  It's true.  But he has pumped it up.  He has pumped it up a bit for his final season.  Yeah, but the media does the same thing.  Oh, Travis.  That damn media.  He's the best.  Travis. 
[02:42:00]  Team of destiny.  Murder two people.  Team of destiny.  He didn't murder anyone.  He was there.  Acquitted for murder.  Paid a family off.  Yeah, what a Hall of Fame player.  A true role model.  Well, I don't care.  I don't care what they do off the field.  He's reading the lady's tweet.  That fucking dumb wife.  Shut your face.  Your husband plays ball.  Just sit home with your big tits and hush.  Oh, that's what Sam knows about.  This is so cool because, you know what?  You know what's cool?  Because now your team's winning the World Series, of course, in baseball. 
[02:42:30]  Congratulations on the World Series win.  And now your team will win the Super Bowl, too.  Congratulations on that.  You know what I'm most excited about?  Cock?  Because you're Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay!  What are the odds that the year the show is going to the Super Bowl, my team is in it?  Oh, right.  Well, let's break a little news to you.  Awkward.  What?  What happened?  We had asked last year.  And I'm a 49ers guy.  Oh, are you?  So I'm excited, too.  Yeah.  Sam and I are going to have a great time in New Orleans. 
[02:43:00]  Go, Joe.  So you going?  You going to Super Bowl?  I thought the show was going.  You know how fun a Super Bowl party would be in New Orleans?  We wouldn't know.  Well, how come we're not going?  We've been asking for years to go.  Oh, my God.  Are we or no?  I thought we were going.  And then it turns out, no, we're not.  I guess we didn't ask early enough.  We've got to ask a full two years in advance instead of one year.  How come nobody came to us and said, you've been bitching about the Super Bowl for years?  Do you guys want to go down there this year?  390 days in advance, they have.  No, but I heard no one from Sirius X.  Are we going to go next year when it's a mere five miles from this building? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I need to know.  Lots of people from Sirius X ever going.  We could take a ferry and then a cab and be there in no time.  Yeah.  Are we going next year?  I hope so.  I mean...  I thought we were going this year.  It's a quick swim away.  We could see where the Super Bowl is going to be next year from this building.  Yes.  We could see from here, though, too.  E-Rock lives near MetLife.  We could go to E-Rock's house for the Super Bowl.  Maybe we should have a Super Bowl party at Eric's house. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, that would be nice.  And invite the listeners to get his address out on the air.  E-Rock, invitation?  You'll have plenty of couch space because no one's interested in football at that house.  Unless he sits out.  I'm implying.  I'm marking that down.  All right.  He's chubby.  Hi, chubby.  Eric is very chubby.  He's chubby.  Could Troy Kwan do a massive montage of all the E-Rock fat jokes?  Yes, he could.  He's got nothing else going on.  I would love to hear that.  You mean like just today?  Just today alone, yes.  So you got Anna Burns Welker. 
[02:44:30]  She's the...  So she's married to him?  The wife, obviously, because her last name's Welker.  I should figure that out on my own.  Hey, fuck.  She was pissed.  A lot of people pissed up there in New England.  And she wrote on Facebook, proud of my husband and the Pats.  By the way, if anyone is bored, please go to Ray Lewis's Wikipedia page.  Six kids, four wives, acquitted for murder, paid a family off.  Yay.  What a Hall of Fame player.  A true role model.  Who wrote that?  At least he wins.  Welker's wife. 
[02:45:00]  Wes Welker, who plays for the Pats, is his wife.  Wow.  And then, of course, she had to apologize, because everyone has to apologize.  Why?  And deleted it.  Model doodle.  And deleted it.  She's deeply sorry.  No, she's not.  I love how much people hate Ray Lewis.  She's so not deeply sorry.  You think Wes said, what the fuck are you doing?  Yeah, shut up, bitch.  I think that was a Wes thing.  Just like Tom Brady and Giselle last year.  How do you expect him to throw the ball and catch the ball?  You remember that?  Right.  Can you play that one?  It's my favorite. 
[02:45:30]  Ugh.  Just a bad one.  My husband.  How's it going?  You hot dummy.  You don't like when women talk about sports?  No, they should shut the fuck up and enjoy the fruits.  Oh, in all fairness.  Shut your mouth.  In all fairness to Giselle, she was being heckled, so she turned around and was like,  how is he supposed to throw the ball and catch the ball?  How about she stays home and watches the game on her giant flat screen fucking TV?  Where is it?  She's so hot.  It's hard to hear, unfortunately.  That's fair. 
[02:46:00]  I was just supposed to catch the ball and throw the ball at the same time.  She was saying it in conversation.  She should have been some sneak filmder.  Yeah, her back was on the camera.  Some sneaky piece.  She's incredibly hot.  Yeah.  What happened to the Pats, you think there, Travis?  You know more about football than me.  They just got outplayed.  Again, right?  By who?  By the Ravens and Ray Lewis.  Yeah, the Ravens were definitely...  Led with 14 tackles.  I think the Ravens were the better team.  Absolutely.  They were favored by, what, nine, ten points?  Got completely outplayed.  Both teams won on the road, too.  That's pretty fucked up.  Ray Lewis, the fucking guy that got off the hook for murder. 
[02:46:30]  What happened?  Two murders, right?  Two murders.  Wasn't it two murders that day?  He was never accused of murder.  Six kids, four wives.  Accessory.  Accessory to murder.  Yeah.  I like that.  That's like earrings to a murder.  No, it's not.  But he's in a court of law.  You're a murder person.  Court of law.  He's a great man.  What?  Great man.  What's that?  He's a murderer's scarf.  What do you think of their chances against the Niners?  I think they've got a great chance.  Absolutely.  I thought they could beat the Patriots. 
[02:47:00]  I didn't think they...  I didn't...  I wasn't confident that they would, but I know they can, and I know that they can beat  the 49ers.  You know they can do it.  Absolutely.  If they put their heart in it.  Oh, boy.  They can definitely beat the 49ers.  Where are you watching the game?  Probably Anthony's house.  Super Bowl party.  Not that I give a shit about the Super Bowl, but...  I'll take the bowl.  I give a shit about the party.  Super Bowl.  Good one.  I'm a little paranoid about watching it there.  High scoring game, you think?  Oh, why is that?  I don't know.  Because these kind of things are like, you know... 
[02:47:30]  So why don't you just do it by myself?  Why don't you just do your routine?  Or I just go to Baltimore and watch it in the wire.  I've got 20 TVs in the house.  You can pick one all by yourself.  Why don't you watch it where they fucking shot the wire?  You're going to fuck up your routine.  Oh, boy.  And that'll fuck the team up.  It sure will.  You can go in Keith's suite.  I probably will.  Or the lounge room.  I'll just go there and lock the door.  Or the basement.  There'll be a party going on.  Living room party.  I want to watch the game.  I'll probably watch.  It's a little TV in the bathroom.  The Baltimore Stark Ravens.  That's what they ought to call it because they're lunatics. 
[02:48:00]  Take us out, you disgusting fat body.  It'll be a good game.  Yeah.  Everyone will be talking about two brothers facing off.  No one will be talking about anything.  Everyone will.  Two brothers?  Who?  Coaches.  Both head coaches.  They're brothers.  Oh, they're not facing off.  They're coaches.  They're standing on the sideline.  Telling people what to do.  It's not like they're out on the field battling.  Saying, hey, you run the ball now.  Oh, God.  Hey, did we do the gay off contest yet?  Did we talk about that?  What is this gay off? 
[02:48:30]  It's the first annual gay off.  Did we talk about it yet or no?  No, not yet.  Well, I'm putting our producer up against anybody because I know.  Thank you.  I don't know what that's all about.  Which one?  You.  Oh, okay.  You're Dr. Gay.  Interesting.  It's got to be you.  I'll be judging.  This guy's saying, is it really Ray's fault that the media was surrounding him?  That's true.  Yeah, but he went down and he was grandstanding knowing everyone was going to.  He didn't say, hey, everybody, come over here.  But of course he didn't.  I'm very emotional and happy that my last season is going to end at the Super Bowl. 
[02:49:00]  What was he saying to the turf, by the way?  Oh, you're so green.  He was mumbling some shit.  What was he mumbling?  No one even knows.  He's very emotional.  He's joking around.  It's fake emotion.  It's not.  It's funny.  Why is he emotional?  Funny guy.  Because he's just an emotional player.  No, he's not.  He's a leader.  Oh, stop.  And he will lead us in the sequel.  Who's us?  Me and the team.  You won't be there at all.  You'll be in some room in the show.  Yeah, he'll be locked in.  Sequestered.  Getting fucked by a guy. 
[02:49:30]  We're not talking about the game.  You're going to be getting fucked by a guy.  You think he's going to give Super Bowl tickets to the families of the two people that were killed?  I doubt it.  That would be nice.  Nice gesture, don't you think?  Oh, shit.  I think everyone wants to go to the Super Bowl.  He can't even give tickets to all his baby mamas.  What are the circumstances to that murder?  I don't know.  Someone slipped on a knife, I think.  Was that it?  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  A few times?  Yeah.  Got up, slipped again.  Over and over again.  That happens.  It gets icy in Atlanta.  Especially with all that blood on the ground. 
[02:50:00]  There was some kind of an altercation after a party.  That's right.  House parties.  You had a better shot at surviving Auschwitz than a fucking house party in a bad neighborhood.  They really do always end in some type of murder.  What happens at these parties?  I don't know.  Oh, man.  It's terrible.  Fucking Christ.  There's dancing.  There's fun.  There's refreshments.  And then a murder on the lawn.  How else do you have a cool party?  Someone was stabbed over the weekend after the Falcons 49ers game.  What is that about?  Stabbed right outside the stadium in the neck. 
[02:50:30]  And then there was an MLK injury.  Some shootings.  He's dead.  Five people shot.  Oh, yeah.  That guy.  Some civil rights leaders were injured.  But we're hoping to keep those beaches open.  Yeah.  I guess there was an MLK parade on MLK Day on MLK Boulevard.  I saw that.  Which, yeah.  Five people shot.  Didn't go well.  No.  No.  I like that non-violence thing that's carrying over so well.  Yikes.  What happened?  Yeah.  It was a little shooting. 
[02:51:00]  What was this?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Chicago?  On the MLK.  I don't know.  Why isn't there any MLKs in good neighborhoods?  That's true.  You would think they would put one MLK symbolically in a nice neighborhood.  Malcolm X Boulevard, Martin Luther King.  That says to white people, your GPS is leading you to your death.  No one doesn't think that when they see Martin Luther King Boulevard.  Well, why wouldn't they just do one?  Yeah.  Look for Gingrich Avenue.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  Right in the middle of Centiport or something.  Make it MLK Boulevard.  Why not?  It's a nice white area.  Yeah.  No crying.  Fighting trouble.  Yeah, you are.  Wouldn't it be funny if it was the street name that just made it like that?  It's just murder.  All of a sudden, people show up.  Where'd you come from?  I guess that's all we got on football.  MLK.  Ravens 49ers.  Two weeks, right?  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  I think it's going to be a high-scoring Super Bowl.  Do you?  Take the over?  It's got two really good quarterbacks.  Yep.  The other quarterback for the Niners, I can't say his fucking name. 
[02:52:00]  Trent Dilfer?  I think that's his name, yes.  Trent Dilfer?  Fucking guy has an arm on him, huh?  Jimmy's name.  That's a real name.  He's a real quarterback.  I swear I thought you made that up.  It sounds like a Jimmy made-up name.  Only Super Bowl-winning quarterback to not be asked back the next year.  Oh.  Yep.  What?  That's right.  How stupid is that?  He was terrible.  They won on their defense.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, but you bring him back.  Just be nice.  Just be nice, right?  Someone had to take the fucking snaps.  Let him decline the invitation.  But someone had to take the snaps. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Just to be nice.  You should just be nice every once in a while.  Yeah.  Travis Teft sounds like a made-up Jimmy name.  Doesn't it?  It's just awful.  Two Fs.  I know.  Two Fs in it.  Who fucking doubles up their Fs?  Teft.  FT doesn't go together for anything.  No.  It's terrible.  There's not a word that starts like FT of...  Ft.  Ft.  Teft.  Ah, it's T-E-F-T.  No, there's double up on those Fs. 
[02:53:00]  Drag them out.  Ugh.  Teft.  Rhymes with left.  Exactly.  Prompted.  And deft, which is the type of fucking she was getting from the rabbi.  Oh, God.  Sorry.  Wow.  Oof.  The rabbi bye-bye mommy.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  It's fine.  She misses out.  They're talking about when my mom left.  She misses out because she doesn't get to see the lovely Little Miss Wright.  That's true. 
[02:53:30]  That is true.  But she gains because she doesn't have to hear this Super Bowl chatter.  It all comes out in the wash.  Are you going to be all right if they lose?  Yeah, sure.  Oh, my God.  Are you sure?  He was all right with his stupid fucking...  No, he was barely all right.  Yeah, he was a little fucked up with that.  No, dude, they just made it that far.  You were in a dark place for a game.  I mean, they even made it this far.  No, the whole season's good because I'm...  Well, please.  Baseball's more important.  Yeah.  Than the Ravens?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Ravens I've only had since 1996.  Oh.  Had.  Yeah. 
[02:54:00]  You had them?  Yeah.  What are you working here for if you're a fucking team owner?  Exactly.  I didn't know you gave birth to a whole bunch of people.  I've seen them win a Super Bowl.  They'll win another one.  So you're bummed Earl Weaver died.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he was bumming.  Yeah, you were tweeting.  Yeah, who saw that coming?  Young man like him.  Poor guy.  Dude, he died on his own cruise.  No, yeah, he died on an Orioles cruise.  It was one of those fan cruises.  Holy shit.  Oh, wow.  Really promote.  Earl Weaver's going to be there.  Who else was on the cruise ship?  Oh, my God.  Not Shagrim.  Obviously.  Stan Musial.  Nobody thought anything of it when the man with the sickle and the fucking hood got on 
[02:54:30]  and said, where's Earl's room?  He's fucking Guess on Earl on the conga line.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  The Grim Reaper's, like, coming up behind him.  What a buzzkill, though.  Yeah.  You're an Orioles fan.  You go on their big fucking cruise thing, and the main guy died.  Did they bury him at sea?  Yeah.  People probably had, like, autograph tickets for the next day.  Holy fuck.  What do you do?  Yeah.  Depressing announcement.  They had to change the meet and greet.  Like, now if you wanted to meet at all, somebody would shoot you. 
[02:55:00]  Or a meet and Greek.  You get to fuck him in the ass.  He's dead body.  And you just know you're sailing around on a boat with his dead body?  You think they keep the dead body, or they get a helicopter to take old buzzkill off the boat?  I see they fucking chain his feet and throw him overboard and drag him.  Take her off for a swim.  We don't want him rotting and smelling up the midnight buffet.  They should have done a weekend at Bernie's with him for the people that actually paid for the cruise. 
[02:55:30]  Exactly.  Prop him up in his uniform.  Where do they put the dead bodies if he's dying on a cruise ship?  Someone out there knows.  Call us.  Huh?  You think they have a morgue?  Probably.  I bet they do.  Maybe they just leave him in his room, and then it's just really awkward.  They turn the AC way down.  Yeah.  Can I make up your room?  I don't know.  You know they hose that shit down, like we've said for many years, and continue onwards.  Yeah, they've got to make the cruise.  What cruise line was it?  I don't know.  Was it a big one? 
[02:56:00]  Big Orioles?  Was it a big ship?  What's that?  Was it a big ship?  Yeah, probably a big giant bird painted on the smokestack.  Kyle Ripken's there.  His fucking wife's at home.  Getting her pussy splashed on all the sheets.  He died on a cruise.  Let's go.  What do we got on this?  Where's my cabana wear?  Yeah, what do we got?  What do we got on this?  What happened about his life?  What happened?  Earl Weaver.  Pierre Cobb, Dan! 
[02:56:30]  Greatest Orioles manager ever.  Who else do they have?  Exactly.  Who else was their manager?  They had one of the Ripkins, right?  Kyle Ripken Sr.  Yeah, Kyle Ripken Sr.  Buck Showalter.  Senior.  Oh, they had Buck Showalter.  They have Buck Showalter.  Who gives a turkey?  Oh, they still have him anyway.  Who else do they have?  Signed him for another six years.  Who else do they have?  Maybe he was in a cotton uniform.  No.  And it shrunk and squeezed his fucking veins and arteries.  Let me guess.  Signed him?  Yes, Buck Showalter was in that episode.  It was a great one.  Do you want to hear what Danny Glover has to say? 
[02:57:00]  Of course I do.  You guys don't want to talk about the gay off?  Oh, yeah.  We got to talk about the gay off.  So what's this about?  Well, it's the Opie and Anthony first annual gay off.  Let's be honest.  We have to call it the first annual.  How about the O and A one and done?  It's a gay off.  There's nothing anymore.  Oh, yeah?  First of a hundred gay offs.  First quarterly.  Yeah, exactly.  Steven Singer signed on for a hundred.  Yes, Tuesday's gay off.  Holy shit.  No, here's the question.  Tuesday's gay? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  How gay is Steven Singer?  I didn't realize he was a gay gentleman.  Yeah, he's a real Peter Pumper.  You ever see what he uses for a vase for those roses?  See, it's his asshole.  Yeah, exactly.  He also uses that as a vase for fists.  Are you a straight guy, married, and not at all homophobic?  Or not that homophobic?  If so, here's your chance to prove it.  And maybe, you don't prove it for free, you can win possibly $1,500.

Yes, if you want to see how the lawyers have made this unfun.  The $1,500 grand prize is provided by Steven Singer Jewelers.  You visit IHateStevenSinger.com today, 
[02:59:00]  because Steven's a big supporter and a good friend to this radio show.  Of course, you have to be 21 or older to enter,  because by then you've probably determined what your sexuality is.  We don't need any of you 19-year-old twinks coming in here  and fucking wrecking the bell curve for the rest of us.  Fixing up the whole place.  All entries, by the way, have to be received by noon Eastern on February the 1st, 2013.  So not much time.  Here's how the contest will work to all you potential cock-grabbers.  Now we're getting into the fun.  Now I want to know, yeah.  Yes, get your dicks out, pull over, because here it comes. 
[02:59:30]  The men and their wives we brought in the studio one at a time,  while the others remain isolated.  We will have a gay male entertainer go through a series of gay acts  on our contest while their wife watches.  How are we going to get a gay male entertainer?  Just hire him.  Yeah, exactly.  Our actions...  Jimmy's phone.  You don't have...  Exactly.  You can read the actions if you want, but you don't have to. 
[03:00:00]  I'm going to read them.  I want to hear them.  They could include hand-holding.  Easy.  Tickling.  Lap dance.  Tickling.  Our entertainer's stripping.  Dry humping.  And, of course, they have to put G-string over the pants fondly.  Do they...  Oh, boy.  Why can't there be a cock on jeans?  Yeah, we need some dick.  That's not pelvic thrusts to the face.  But that's not skin on skin.  Why are they...  G-string.  You know.  Feather games. 
[03:00:30]  Our entertainer removing our contested clothes item by item.  Our entertainer doing G-string push-ups over our contestant.  Why are we doing this?  Touching genitals over the underwear.  I love how they put over the...  Can the fucking cock lawyers stop wrecking everything in the description?  I didn't think we were going to get through this.  Fucking stink.  Well, I mean...  If you're going to do it, do it.  Oil massages, G-string, soft kissing on the neck, ear, etc. 
[03:01:00]  Wait.  Not in the mouth?  Sucking fingers or toes...  No, why would you?  Why can't you kiss on the mouth?  I don't know.  You ask the fucking lawyers who probably all enjoy this activity.  Can I kiss you on the mouth?  Well, the game will continue until a contestant decides to quit or the audience dozes off.  All contestants in the milquetoast contest will go through the same gay acts in the same order  and they'll probably all get through with them because none of them are threatening.  Of course.  That's just it.  We can't...  I'm sorry.  I gotta...  I gotta...  We can't do this. 
[03:01:30]  I say we do.  No.  We can't do this bit because...  Everyone will get through it.  Everyone will go through all this and then we'll know what happens.  We sit here and go, now what?  No!  These idiots don't know how radio works.  Why are they phrased like this?  Who wrote this?  Who wrote this?  Those are phrases so lawyers can...  They should have to grab balls.  Look, look.  You know?  The idea is good.  I feel nauseous.  The idea is good, but they're stupid.  They're stupid.  Every guy's gonna get through this.  Of course they are.  That's nothing.  As a goof, they'll get through it. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, forget it.  Exactly.  Where's the radio wizard?  Fucking lawyers.  Oh, boy.  Will he come in today?  I don't know.  I think he's here.  We're off to see the wizard.  I think we all think that it's a good bit.  Yeah.  No, but...  I think it's a good bit.  No, I like the bit...  And I don't think people will get through all those things.  I don't think so either.  Really?  I bet they will.  I don't think so either.  They absolutely will.  Holy fuckballs.  Really?  That's nothing going on.  I mean, I think...  But should it be some aggressive behavior to knock these guys out? 
[03:02:30]  Like what?  I mean, I don't know.  What's the prize?  Aside from getting fucked in the ass or blown, I don't know how much more aggressive...  $1,500.  These guys know they're doing it for $1,500.  How about you have to touch the tip of your nose right against his asshole?  There you go.  Bare asshole.  There you go.  Or how about it has to hang in front of your face?  Whoever can get the closest to the face with the cock hanging without touching it is the winner.  Exactly.  The tiebreaker is how many fingers you can get in your bunghole.  Exactly.  Tiebreaker.  And if you get a fist, $1,500 for you. 
[03:03:00]  You're going.  If all three get fists, $1,500 for each guy.  Yeah, for everybody.  But the idea is...  I like the idea, but I think they're fucking up to a point where a lot of these guys for  $1,500, knowing it's not gay because they're doing it for the money, will fucking easily  do this shit.  They'll go through everything.  It's not threatening.  The wording annoys me so much.  That's what annoys me.  Well, the wording is just so you can read it.  On top of pants.  This isn't like literally, legally, how you have to put it on the air.  I'm going to have an open mind.  Wow.  And asshole.  I'm going to have an open mind.  We're going through it.  We're going through it.  Of course we should. 
[03:03:30]  It's a good contest, but I just don't like the way they phrased it.  Don't get me wrong.  I didn't say it was a bad contest.  I just know how the lawyers get involved.  Right.  And as this moves forward, they're going to start taking some of these things off the list,  by the way.  Nope.  I don't think so.  I don't think so either.  They've already approved the list.  Yeah, they've already approved the list.  As long as there's no penetration or...  What's the fun in that?  Fluids.  Okay.  Fluids.  You can't penetrate the fluid.  A really viscous fluid builds up under the gums.  Can we have Dr. Steve pop each contestant in the shitter? 
[03:04:00]  Of course.  He should just be the gay entertainer.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that was our original.  That's Dr. Steve if he wants to be the gay entertainer.  That's the name of Weird Medicine.  The original name.  The gay entertainer.  Him and his fucking...  Him and his cum catcher mustache.  As far as I know...  So it doesn't leak in my eyes from my mouth when I'm upside down.  And you don't literally have to read...  That's what I was saying before.  You don't have to read this word for word.  Oh, okay.  This is just for you guys.  We don't care.  And I don't think one of the rules is no nudity, right?  No, of course there's nudity. 
[03:04:30]  Well, what's about the over the pants?  I didn't know that.  Yeah, like...  Well, because it has to get progressively worse.  It can't just be a guy sitting down and getting his cock grabbed.  Why not?  Exactly.  Then we all come and go home, winners.  Winners.  They are not going to allow any guy to get his cock grabbed.  They might.  I don't think so.  I bet they will.  It's a big thing with Liberty Media.  They encourage that.  Oh, they do.  All right.  It's in the company bylines.  The only thing on top of the pants should have to be like that thing where you breathe  hot air through.  Like he's got to put his mouth right over the dancer's fucking dick and go... 
[03:05:00]  You know what would be funny is none of the contestants should shower for three days.  That's disgusting.  What about hard-ons?  Ah, we'll have them.  If one of these guys gets a hard-on, do we kick him out?  Encourage the boner.  I think you should win if you don't.  Good luck.  The boner.  You know what?  The wife is sitting in.  Jimmy's on to something.  Of course I am.  Guy gets hard the quickest through all this nonsense.  Oh, man.  Exactly.  And then they're on the clock. 
[03:05:30]  And then the guy is doing everything he can.  And then we time how long it takes for him to get hard.  Hey, how about thinking about somebody slipping us a Mickey here.  What about if one of the guys come in with a girl and he's gay?  You have to show your marriage license.  Marriage license.  Oh, really?  They're going to be required.  Oh, they've got to be married.  Yes, they have to be married.  If the wife sits here.  Who knows where a marriage license is?  What the fuck is going to do this contest?  You think we're going to get people?  Absolutely.  1,500 clams?  Yeah.  Where's all these?  Sam Williams.  Now, Sam's trying to throw in another... 
[03:06:00]  The wife can also tap her husband out because the wife is watching.  The wife is sitting here watching everything.  So she might get uncomfortable and say, hey.  She may get uncomfortable.  Or the husband could get uncomfortable.  Throws on the towel.  And then it's going to be awkward when the guy is like, oh, come on.  Come on.  Sam and I are very confident in this contest.  I think you guys should have an open one.  I think so, too.  Why don't we get in the wall locked in?  A little more room in here.  Oh, boy.  For more gay men.  Yeah, but I mean, just so it's fucking...  Where's everybody going to sit? 
[03:06:30]  I was told that we're going to get a little taste of Martha Stewart's studio.  They're going to give us a taste, not the whole thing.  That's what I heard, and I don't believe her a little more.  I don't believe it.  Dr. Steve, Gay Entertainer of the Year.  What's up, sir?  Thank you.  But it's early in the year, so you could lose your title.  But right now, you've got Gay Entertainer of the Year.  Congratulations on that.  Thank you, my friend.  I'm honored.  I'm honored.  I'm honored.  All right.  Thanks, Dr. Steve. 
[03:07:00]  That was terrific.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Oh, no.  Well, he wasn't doing anything.  By the way, manscaping is on the list, so, I mean, this is like...  Yeah.  Yeah.  They'll have to shave each other's pubes.  You would be okay shaving, like, a guy shaving your pubes?  Yeah, if you did it with his teeth, Anthony would be okay.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm pretty sure some of these things on this list, even worded this way, would  be things that I wouldn't do for $1,500.  How are they going to allow shaving?  And we were discussing some stuff last week.  Are you entering the contest, though? 
[03:07:30]  No, I can't.  You need the money.  I can't.  I do need the money.  I would be in the contest.  How about we fire you so you officially could be in the contest, then we rehire you after  the contest.  Even if you didn't rehire me, that $1,500 sounds sweet.  It's going to go a long way.  Tempting.  You know what's cool that I do from now on?  It's a new thing I picked up that I like something.  I'm going to go, sweet!  Oof.  I hope not.  Because it's cool.  No, it's not.  Jesus. 
[03:08:00]  I say something.  Are you excited about this gay-off?  Sweet!  Where's all the info for the contest?  It's at SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  All right, good.  Opie and Anthony or Opie Anthony?  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony, no and.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And.  Yeah.  Opie Anthony.  The website has an answer.  Opie and Anthony with the end.  Shouldn't it be both?  SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  No more questions.  This sounds like a comedy you've ever seen.  And Dr. Steve's back.  I don't know why, because he didn't do well the first time.  No, his phone crapped out.  What's going on? 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, I guess I mysteriously got disconnected.  I'm not sure what happened.  No, I purposely hung up on you because you had nothing for the show.  But anyway, what's up?  What's up to you?  Nothing.  You guys called me.  Oh, shit.  That's the best part.  We call him for nothing?  Poor guy.  He's a busy man.  He's a doctor, you know.  Quickest fucking hang-up ever.  Yeah, that was pretty bad.  Well, you weren't getting into anything.  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm sorry.  You guys called me.  Hey, wait.  You saw somebody this weekend.  Who was in your town?  Jim Florentine. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  You were praising him.  He was good, huh?  Oh, God.  It was a beautiful hour of comedy.  He's hilarious.  He is fucking hilarious, Jim.  That's great.  All right.  Yeah.  When he starts biting his teeth and talking like his neighbors.  I mean, it was a great show.  The comedy club in Knoxville is actually a good comedy club.  The crowds get it, and they keep their mouths fucking shut, and they just sit there and laugh.  Oh, a good comedy club, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Knoxville? 
[03:09:30]  What about that?  Nah, you know what?  Until I've been to Ville, I just won't.  What do you think of a good comedy club like that, though?  Are you, like, pump you up at all?  So wee!  Oh, God, he can't.  He even forgot his own fucking...  No, I'm just thinking of all the empty seats in San Diego this Friday, Saturday.  Oh, no.  What?  What are you talking about?  It's going to be warm, though.  I'm sure it will be.  Maybe it's opposite day in San Diego.  Oh, I hope so. 
[03:10:00]  Diego San.  I have a question for you, Dr. Steve, about my elbow.  Yeah.  How long should it hurt?  Like, I've got some injury, like, from working out.  Very good.  And it's been hurting for, like, fucking a while, so I laid off it, like, three and a half weeks ago, but it's still tender.  Yeah.  Is it tender on the outside of the elbow where that little knob is?  Right around there, yeah.  Yeah, you may actually have a form of tennis elbow.  I think I do.  So what do I do?  Well, you can get a tennis elbow splint that will take the pressure off of that end of the tendon, and if that doesn't work, then what we would normally do is have you lay off of it but inject it with cortisone. 
[03:10:30]  Ooh.  To just calm it the fuck down, and then...  To do some Lance Armstrong shit.  Yeah, right.  Shit that up.  It's a different kind of steroid, different kind of steroid.  These are not for formal.  Oh, I'm sorry.  So now, can I still work out with it, or...?  Well, you would be able to after that, yeah, but you'd have to, you know, you're just continuing to re-injure it.  No, no, I haven't.  I haven't worked out.  I haven't done anything in, like, fucking three weeks, but it's better than it was.  It's not as sore.  Yeah.  Just go to CVS or any pharmacy and ask them for a tennis elbow splint, and you put it on just to the side, just distal, in other words, toward the hand. 
[03:11:00]  A distal.  Sorry.  Just toward the hand of that joint, and what it does is it takes the pressure off of the tendon at that point, and it'll allow it to heal.  Oh, okay.  I got an elbow question, too.  Oh.  That mysterious elbow pain when you're driving your car, and you put your elbow down every once in a while, and you get that sharp pain that's brutal, and then it goes away, and you know you don't have an actual injury. 
[03:11:30]  What's that about?  Thank you.  Yeah.  I'll hang up now, and I'll listen for you.  You mother fucker.  I'll hang up now.  What is that mystery pain?  I brought this up a couple weeks ago, and people were tweeting me going, fuck yeah, man.  I get that, too.  Huh.  Well, you can do a lot of things.  Driving is sort of an unnatural position. 
[03:12:00]  No, you feel like it's like a bone chip or something floating around.  What's that?  Fuck!  There is a little burse at the end of the elbow.  A burse is just a fluid-filled sac.  Ew.  This is filler shit, because he doesn't know the answer.  No, because it could be like that's bursitis, right?  No, and you can put some pressure on it, especially if you're driving and you're sort of leaning  on it, and you're cutting the circulation off to it for a short period of time, and you  can get kind of an intense pain there until you take the pressure off and then move around. 
[03:12:30]  It's a split...  Oh, bullshit!  It's a split second of excruciating pain, but as soon as you lift your elbow, you're  all good.  Exactly.  But right now, if I move...  Look, I'm trying to make it hurt, and I can't do it.  Can't do it.  Dr. Steve, it's almost the same thing.  What is that?  You ever hear on the kneecap, you get like a little, tiny little bubble, it feels like,  and then if you hit it, it fucking is excruciating.  What is that?  It's from kneeling too much in men's rooms.  They ought to make those glory holes higher. 
[03:13:00]  Put a stepladder there so I can stand up.  Exactly, so the guy can peek over and film you.  Oh, wonderful.  There's a bursa in front of me.  Bursa.  A bursa?  Yeah.  Bursa.  Ah, bursa.  A bursa what?  Flavor?  If you bind them up by putting your knee or your elbow in a funny position, then they  can cause pain until you move it.  Yeah?  You didn't answer that one either.  Crazy.  So wait.  Bursa.  Oh, really?  My elbow condom can help it heal, actually? 
[03:13:30]  Say that again?  My elbow thing should help it heal?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're talking about the tennis elbow splint?  Yeah.  Yeah, we were talking about that.  But I wouldn't have to fucking...  I can't work out until it's healed, right?  Well, you'll continue to injure it.  Okay.  You know, you can do light workout and you can ice it down and you can do that stuff, but  as far as doing anything heavy that requires use of the elbow or twisting the wrist, any  of those kinds of...  So swimming is okay?  A little swimming?  Yeah, a little swimming would be fine.  How about if I just splash around in the kid pool and yell, yay? 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  Wow.  I'd just work through it, Jim.  I have it.  Just fucking go as tough and as hard as you can.  I was, believe me.  And then just walk it off, dick.  I was, and it was fucking hurting worse.  Yeah.  So I said, before I do serious damage...  You're a pussy.  ...let me just take good care of myself because it's about taking care of me today.  Oh, that's true.  Dr. Steve, again, thank you so much.  Oh, you're welcome.  You are.  You're terrific.  Bevy of knowledge.  Thank you, sir.  Bevy of medical knowledge. 
[03:14:30]  I'll see you soon, all right?  Thanks, sir.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  See you soon.  Do you want to talk about the gay off or not?  No.  No, we talked about it already.  Go.  Yeah, exactly.  As soon as we hang up the phone, it'll be a gay off.  You know, if it helps Jim...  Are we a...  You'll kill yourself?  A gay...  It will.  There'll be a gay entertainer here giving oiled massages.  I don't like an oiled massage.  I feel like a fucking...  From a gay entertainer?  Yeah, for the gay off.  I don't think I want that.  Hey, I see we're on our part of the website.  Speaking of gay, who the fuck are these three? 
[03:15:00]  I wouldn't say shit about new people walking by.  No, that one is Sal.  Are those interns?  Oh, those are the interns?  Those are new interns.  Sal and the two interns.  Why the fuck do they look like Sal?  They all look the same.  They look like hipsters.  When I was introducing to everybody this morning, Kenny thought we had three new interns.  He didn't recognize Sal.  Sal.  They're all dressed the same.  Dude, they all look like dumb hipsters.  Yeah, fucking peck of touches.  What?  Wait, we have new interns?  Yeah, two new interns.  Watch, look, they're going into the office.  Watch, watch, watch.  One, two, three.  Fascinating.  Oh, I thought they were going to get in there. 
[03:15:30]  I have to ask a question.  One of them.  Yeah.  We ask this question every time new interns start.  Yeah.  Who's in charge of the interns?  Oh.  That would be me.  Master blaster.  No, the storyline continues.  You don't want that gig.  Yeah.  What happened, Iraq?  Exactly.  What happens with you?  Why doesn't future past you tell you?  Exactly.  Remember the last time you said okay and you've quit many times?  No.  How are you such a fat, biff, tannin-haired worm?  Why do they bring you back in every time? 
[03:16:00]  Why?  How'd that happen, Iraq?  Exactly.  Comment, Iraq.  I don't want anybody else doing it.  This boy's life hairdo.  No.  But it's not about them wanting anybody.  It's about you wanting.  You think he wants to do it?  Yes, he secretly wants to do it.  He just won't admit it.  But he doesn't want to disappoint us by saying that.  You're missing good jokes over there.  Yeah, it is funny.  God damn, Iraq.  That was a good one.  I can multitask.  Oh, my God.  Iraq.  You don't want to be in charge. 
[03:16:30]  I would prefer not to know.  But you said this already.  It interferes with your other job.  In charge of fridge.  All right, now you're just grasping at straws.  Grasping at straws.  We can't find anything.  Exactly.  We don't all have trunks.  Some of us need straws.  How else are we supposed to sip out of the lake?  We were grasping at straws.  That's what you do to hay.  Hey, he grasped it. 
[03:17:00]  He grasped that.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  Remember we wanted the montage of Iraq insults?  Yes.  I didn't know there was already one up on YouTube.  Yes.  This might be bad.  I don't know.  But it's a minute.  Bad like good?  We'll find that fucking Beatles song really fast.  Sweet.  What's your shape?  Ernest Hemingway.  James French fries.  Mayo Angelo.  Sir Francis Bacon.  I got one.  Oh, why?  What's your...  Stephen King appetizers.  Stephen King crab legs.  Stephen a la King.  Truman Chipotle. 
[03:17:30]  Robert Frosty.  John Grisham.  Arthur C. Clark Barr.  William Shakespeare.  Stephen Burger King.  Yeah, all right.  I got a better one than that.  Oh, yeah?  Stephen Kingdom column.  They will be done.  Martin Frosted Flakes.  Charles Chickens.  I was going to go with Charles Dixens.  Boy, Iraq.  Look, he's just sitting there with his beard.  Edgar Allen Poe Boy.  Walt Whitman Sampler.  Dan Franks and Bean.  Michael Cryton. 
[03:18:00]  HG Well Done.  Anne Rice-O-Tony.  Kurt Vonnegut.  JK's stomach growling.  He loved the garlic butter sauce.  Arthur Conan Boiled.  Agatha Crispy.  You got the lime beetles.  I hope you're going.  Dr. Moose.  Dr. Sauce.  How about the fat in the hat?  Uh, Bradbury Muffin.  Who's that bitch?  Dial M for fucking.  Dial B for burger.  Shakes.  Spear.  Why did you grow the beard, Iraq? 
[03:18:30]  Exactly.  Why?  Oh, yeah.  He couldn't help but grow the beard.  Oh, yeah.  Did you catch any crumbs that might try to make a fucking break for it?  Hey.  I should eat these sauce, man.  Make a break for it.  That fucking works, man.  That was very funny.  That was when Iraq grew the beard, and we were saying that he was like Hemingway.  I don't remember it.  Hemingway was what we said.  All right, Luke.  I don't remember that.  Luke using force on Twitter.  You get the big fucking Twitter plug today, sir.  That was a funny one.  Retweet.  There you go.  I think that's the guy who's always like tweeting, complaining that he should have Sal's job. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  He should have Sal's job.  Obviously, right?  Yeah.  It's funny.  Proving it already.  We were talking at Iraq's house that we made a horrendous mistake hiring Sal.  Who was talking about it?  Oh, wow.  Oh.  He said it to you, but you were busy.  But he made matches.  Babysitting.  You know what?  Sal grew on me.  That's because he annoys everybody else, and you like people who annoy people.  There you go.  That's all it is.  So you and Eric were talking about Sal being not a great hire? 
[03:19:30]  No, I didn't say that.  Eric, did Opie mention it?  I didn't say that.  Tell me the truth, Eric.  Eric.  He agreed.  He did.  Dr. Steve just wrote me.  He says, I blame Sal for that abortion of a phone call.  Why is Dr. Steve blaming Sal for his abortion of a phone call?  It's probably Sal's fault.  Dr. Steve phone call was good.  Yeah.  Especially when he talked about the bursa.  Bursa.  Bursa flavor.  The bursa.  Yeah. 
[03:20:00]  Want to do line of the day?  Yes, we do.  Oh, you know what?  I have a good line of the day.  You do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actually, I have quite a few good lines of the day.  What do you mean?  Well, I'll be from the Twisted Minds.  It produces Peter Farrelly and Charles Wessler.  Comes out of this year's craziest, most outrageous comedy.  It's Movie 43.  Movie 43.  The biggest cast ever brought together for one of the funniest, most outrageous movies ever made.  With stars like, hold on, Elizabeth Banks, Kristen Bell, Halle Berry, Gerard Butler, and Hugh Jackman. 
[03:20:30]  Movie 43 includes some of the most uncomfortable movie scenes ever filmed.  Including awkward first dates, leprechaunism, teen snacks, and intimate relationships between superheroes.  There's more stars also like Uma Thurman, Kate Winslet, Justin Long, and Johnny Knoxville.  Movie 43 is about coming to terms with your awkward, sick, twisted side.  There's even more stars like, here's more, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Lee Eve Schreiber, and of course, the lovely Anna Faris. 
[03:21:00]  Yes, Richard Gere?  Wow.  And Leslie Bibb.  Once you see this movie, you can never unsee it.  Yes, Movie 43.  It's rated R, and for a very good reason.  It's one of the most shocking, original, and dangerous comedies ever made.  Catch!  The funniest, outrageous movie of the year.  Movie 43 opens in theaters January 25th. 
[03:21:30]  Speaking of Richard Gere, I re-watched, after not seeing for a long-ass time, An Officer and a Gentleman over the weekend.  How was it?  Best head in 50 states.  Aside from that mushy fucking chick stuff, that's a pretty goddamn good movie.  Fuck yeah, man.  I like that movie.  Hey, big spender, give us your money!  When they robbed him in the beginning?  Fucking robbed him in the beginning for a little kid.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Mayonnaise. 
[03:22:00]  How sexy was fucking Whirly's chick?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She was that trashy blonde chick.  Fuck Paula.  And then he thought she was in love with him, and he fucking got DORs.  That's a great scene.  And then he gets engaged.  She's all happy.  And then he's like, yeah, well, I'm out.  But we can, you know, move in with my parents for a little while.  And you're like, fuck you!  Such a great scene.  You fucking asshole!  He goes, you and Mom will get along great.  Work at JCPenney.  I'll be floor manager in two years.  Doesn't it just sound like the worst life possible?  It's like, yeah, oh, I thought I was marrying a fighter pilot, but okay. 
[03:22:30]  This is good.  A naval aviator.  I love when David Caruso craps out.  Oh, yeah, in the little pool thing.  Redhead?  He couldn't get out of the fucking little straps.  He almost drowned.  Yeah, that was a good movie.  I like that one.  So that.  I was watching, like, old movies over the weekend.  Because I've seen all the new ones.  Why bother, right?  That was good, officer and gentleman.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm talking to you, motherfucker!  But I can't watch that scene where it's like, I know I have to go! 
[03:23:00]  Because I just think of a dumb sound drop that we've had for years that we've used quite  often.  I love it.  What is this?  I love it.  What is that?  It's a book of spells from J.K.  Rowling?  What is it?  It's for your son.  It's your son.  That's your book?  It's for the G-Plug.  It's for PS3?  He is.  He is.  What, do you just read on your PS3?  Yeah.  That doesn't sound very fun.  It's horrible.  What kind of game is that?  It sounds horrible.  Reading game?  Oh, why would you read? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, what's my score I've read?  Oh, this is great.  Thanks.  Can I play other readers around the world?  Yeah.  Oh, I like the multiplayer reading.  Yeah.  Oh.  You want to team up on Chapter 3?  Yeah.  Anthony, what's your fucking gamer tag?  I want to read with you.  Oh, fuck that.  Let's do Line of the Day, then.  Hey, Line of the Day.  What do we got?  How many runner-ups today?  37.  You got three runners-ups.  Runner-ups.  Runner-ups.  Introduce Line of the Day properly.

Oh.  Yeah.  Well, hold on to Line of the Day.  This might be it.  Apple Boy Healthy. 
[03:24:30]  I like it.  It's positive.  Here's the first runner-up Line of the Day.  Biden gave his position away.  Yes.  Biden sucked the dick on TV and was like, oh, shit.  This is pretty yummy, boss.  It's funny.  Talking about dick.  This is pretty yummy, boss.  It's talking to the president.  Sure.  That's sucking dick.  It's great.  Next runner-up.  Could you gather friends to watch your work?  I could never gather friends to watch my work.  You could gather friends.  Exactly.  Try that first, yeah. 
[03:25:00]  First.  I was implying that Jimmy doesn't have friends.  That was just plain mean.  Oh, I thought you just meant I was a bad gatherer.  Oh, well.  I didn't get that.  Oh, I thought you meant with such a bevy of friends.  How could I not gather them?  Much better your way.  I want to thank Jason Statham for coming in.  Jason Statham was great.  Go see his new movie Friday.  I forgot the name of it.  Parker.  Parker.  Thank you.  What you should have said is, Jim, with a bevy of friends like yours, your gathering 
[03:25:30]  skills need improvement.  It's a new movie.  It's different for him.  He parallel parks during the whole movie.  His name's Parker.  It's very dull.  No, no, no, no.  He doesn't.  He just, his name is Parker, and he just keeps trying to get his last name changed to Posey.  His first name's Peter.  He's Spider Guy.  It's a man trying to come up with a cool new name for people that hang out at the park. 
[03:26:00]  I'm a Parker.  These ideas all stink.  No, they're pretty good.  He was actually supposed to be parquet-er, but then the butter people suit.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  Who's this?  It's Apple Boy Healthy.  No.  Who is that?  Oh, hi.  Hi.  Who's that?  Who's that bitch?  I don't know.  Some chubby little blonde.  What?  Is it line of the daytime or runner-up still?  Yeah.  Last runner-up.  All right.  Hit that thing.  Please.  That fucking oinker can belt out a tune. 
[03:26:30]  I'll tell you that.  That was a good one.  Oinker.  E-Rog, who is that twat that walked by?  That's Roland.  I mean, Roland.  Roland, who was that?  Roland, who was that?  Comment, Roland, comment.  It's an actress.  It's an actress?  Yeah.  It's an actress.  It's Anne.  It's Anne when you have a towel next to her.  Roland, you're going to get mad if I don't bring this reading shit home?  Oh, damn.  It's in a big box and everything.  You want it, Travis?  Roland was kind enough to give me one. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, it comes to life, though.  Do you have a PS3 or an Xbox?  I'm fucking rolling in, though.  Yeah, I know, right?  A PS3's busted.  I hope you're doing your fair share.  I would have to get a new PS3 just to use this.  And you wouldn't.  You'd get probably an Xbox now.  I think it might, yeah.  I think you're right about that.  Yeah, get the old Xbox.  Do they have it for it?  Well, thank you, anyway.  I can't be out with your other problem, too.  What happened?  I have no idea what he said.  It's a PS3 problem.  I don't either.  Oh, you can get me a PS3? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  What?  Well, now we're talking.  Wow.  Look at that.  I need a new Xbox for my house.  It's not reading the DVDs very well.  Oh, no.  I'm going to try a little payola.  Yeah?  If you get me a brand new Mercedes, I'll rave about it.  With that, here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[03:28:00]  Line of the day.  Hands digging trenches, routing pipes and cables.  Hands slathered in lard.  I was born as my father's having sugarcane, so my brother and I.  Sweet.  Nice.  Very good.  There you have it.  See you tomorrow.  The Opie and Anthony Show is pretty much over. 
[03:28:30]  This show will be available later today with SiriusXM On Demand.  After ONA Live is next.  Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Things are not going to go well.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live, 866-WOW-1-WOW for what did you learn and all that.  I'll tell you what I learned. 
[03:29:00]  I don't have a lot of faith in this intern class.  E-Rock, you know Sal is the one telling him how to do stuff.  Yeah.  This is not, that's not good.  Well, for that kind of stuff, he is.  Sal doesn't know what he's doing.  I told him to avoid eye contact with you.  He came in here and said,  Okay, so what we do is we throw out the garbage.  And they're just sitting there like, okay.  Like, he didn't tell them what was garbage and what wasn't.  It was their first time in the studio they had no idea about anything that's going on here.  Well, I'm pretty sure that they could assess that if something is obviously garbage, they could throw it out. 
[03:29:30]  Not true, because...  Like, if there was a banana peel, I don't think anybody was being like,  Hey, Sal, is this so we do this for tomorrow?  Sam, we have folders for that.  We put the banana peels in folders.  You know, there's a lot of protein in the peel itself.  Yeah.  So we saved the banana peel.  Yes.  Maybe they could have used some help with, like, what exactly is garbage and not garbage.  And then once we'd gotten there, and if they still asked, okay, so the garbage.  I see there's a giant trash can in the room.  Yes.  Now, where do we put the garbage? 
[03:30:00]  Yes, I know where you're going with this.  Then you could have been like, you obviously throw the garbage in the trash.  Well, certain things that the guys leave behind could be misinterpreted as garbage, but something could we hold on to.  Well, they misinterpreted it as garbage because the guy who's in charge comes in and goes,  All right, first things first.  Hold on.  Put all the garbage in the garbage can.  First things first, I am not in charge of the interns.  That's right.  That's what I learned today, is that E-Rock, no matter how many times he hisses a little fit about it,  is still in charge of the interns. 
[03:30:30]  Hey, Sal.  You didn't really get the...  You didn't really get that.  He's talking to you, Sal.  You can't just ignore him.  Did you say Jim in the end, right?  Right.  Okay, so then don't worry about this.  Those are guest headphones, yes.  Jimmy doesn't sit there.  Jimmy sits here, Ant here, over there.  No, Sam sits here.  Sam sits here between 10 and 11.  And what time is it?  It is...  Between 10 and 11.  That's exactly right, E-Rock.  13 after.  You're paying attention.  That's right.  I'm going to do the phones.  That's right.  I'll just put him on hold.  Sal is learning the way to radio.  13 past the hour. 
[03:31:00]  That's for all our friends in different time zones.  Why do you, Eric, still do this?  Do you like it?  I think you do.  It's all right.  It's not terrible.  I think you like...  But I think we'll lose it if I don't do it.  No, I don't think that's true.  I don't think that you are the one guy holding the internship program together.  Well, they don't want you doing it.  That's because I'm busy.  I have people to entertain.  You just sit around all day sloughing off. 
[03:31:30]  Right?  No.  I saw you, Eric, trying to figure out, what do I do all day?  What can I say that I do?  Technicality.  Yeah.  You like the idea of the young guys looking up to you, I think.  It's all right.  I think you like that.  But what you don't like is when they eventually all turn on you.  And that's when...  Because that's what you do.  Why?  I turned on you a long time ago.  No, I know, but you turn everybody else.  That's not true.  If they watched you and they were like, you know what? 
[03:32:00]  Sam gives this guy a hard time, but he's wrong.  He's off on this one.  I don't know what Sal's problem is.  Sal's always making fun of Eric.  Sal couldn't be more wrong.  If that were the case, then that would be one thing.  But people turn on you because they're like, oh, I guess those guys are right.  You know?  No.  You don't think so?  No.  All right.  Well, we'll see what happens with these guys.  What do you think, Sal?  It's going to go down.  You were an intern.  I was.  Did I turn you against Eric?  Eric, or did you just say, oh, this is the deal? 
[03:32:30]  This is the deal, yeah.  Okay.  No, and then, yeah, until I fell into the same boat as, like, Troy, like, where he has,  I was like, Troy went through the same thing.  I was like, Troy's fucking hard on Eric, man.  I can't believe it.  And then I was like, wait, no, wait a minute.  Troy is completely right.  I'm not even the hardest on Eric anymore.  No.  Maybe Troy is.  Roland's bad.  Roland is bad, too.  Who's the hardest on you here?  Who busts your balls the worst?  Historically, maybe me, but as in the last six months.  Probably Roland, but he does it to everybody. 
[03:33:00]  Sal has been doing it to you pretty bad lately.  Yeah, because Sal thinks he's cool.  Do you think you're cool, Sal?  I think I'm the fucking coolest, because I'm in front of Eric.  You're not cool.  Yeah, I don't know.  They didn't even know that Sal was still here when he was walking down the hallway.  You know what was great?  When Opie and Anthony saw the new interns, they go, who are those three new interns walking  down the hall?  They didn't even know you.  You just blended right in with them.  I want to tell you interns something.  You look at this guy, Sal, and you realize he can be leapfrogged at any moment, okay? 
[03:33:30]  You realize that he's telling you what to do now, but I mean, you guys got three months  here.  You could easily have his job.  Don't you think that's it?  Is that a threat that you think about, Sal?  It's not a threat, but it's absolutely true.  You're not going to try to fight for your job, then?  No, I'm going to do my job.  To the ability that you've been doing it now?  Well, yeah.  I mean, I always try to strive better.  You're not going to sit there and be like, oh, there are two young guys now.  I better actually do something.  That doesn't enter your head.  Like, you're just like, oh, just day-to-day, as always.  Hey, I'm following the... 
[03:34:00]  I'm going to tell Opie something.  I'm going to tell Opie.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know what I'm doing, right, Eric?  It's great.  So you're just going to go day-to-day, and you figure, you know what?  They haven't fired me for gross incompetence yet.  I don't see it happening.  Exactly.  That type of deal.  That's exactly what I'm thinking.  You think that's what he's thinking, Eric?  It's possible.  It's possible.  I think we're all thinking that, though.  That he's grossly incompetent?  No, that we're all doing the same thing.  Oh, I see.  Well, yeah, but most of us don't have to worry about being fired for gross incompetence. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  Because we're not grossly incompetent.  Oh, that is true.  Well, most of us.  Yes, what'd you say?  I said it's coming from Eric.  Meaning?  Meaning exactly that.  I'm untouchable.  He's untouchable, yeah.  But he is also grotesquely incompetent.  Oh, wow.  See?  Look at him trying to fit in.  Wow.  Grotesquely.  There's nothing I want more in this lifetime to fit in with these guys here.  Is that right?  Yeah.  He can look every day.  Hmm?  That's how he makes it look every day.  Oh.  That he's trying to fit in.  He obviously tries to curry your favor. 
[03:35:00]  Eric interprets...  Mine, specifically?  Oh, yeah.  Why do you say that?  Because just the way he talks to you and laughs at some things that you point out subtly,  he laughs like it's a huge fucking joke to everybody.  No, I'm not as hilarious as it seems like I am when Sal's around.  No, you are, but he over-exaggerates.  He does.  I used to hold back in terms of laughing around Eric when it came to fat jokes and stuff like that.  So you always thought he was a fucking schlub?  Yes.  But you didn't want to say it?  No, because I like Eric. 
[03:35:30]  Because I don't dress like him.  Is that it?  No, no, it's nothing like that.  I just thought it would be...  It's what it is.  I looked at Eric as like...  I looked up to Eric.  Mm-hmm.  And then...  Now you just look out to Eric.  Yeah, yeah.  You realize it's not the height.  It's not the height.  It's more of a width difference, but go on.  Right.  Yeah.  My horizons are broadened when I look at Eric.  Because there's so much more to take in.  Yeah, peripheral vision.  Yeah.  Panorama.  But now I just don't give a fuck.  So I just laugh at anything.  Like if Ant makes a fat joke or Jim makes a fat joke or anything. 
[03:36:00]  You love it.  I think it's hysterical.  How does he react when you're in the room with him?  When you, Eric, are in the room with Sal and Ant and Jim are sitting there busting on you for being so big and fat?  How does Sal...  Hang on, hang on.  No, that's what they're saying I'm saying.  When you're talking about how big and fat.  Where does Sal...  How does Sal react?  There are plenty of times when those two throw out lines.  Yes, you know, it's like, oh, that one kind of cuts.  But I can recognize that they are funny.  Right.  Cuts like melted butter, huh?  Yeah, sure.  Whatever.  Whatever you associate with. 
[03:36:30]  So they'll make these barbs, if you will.  And he'll just start pounding the console, throwing his head down like he's going to cry.  Like this is the funniest thing he ever heard.  You do that?  But it's every line.  No, it's not every line.  Every time.  How many times...  Does he do that every day?  Is he in there like...  I didn't see him do it today, but it has been in the past.  I do, it's quiet.  There's been...  No, Eric interprets me laughing at him as like insubordination.  Because you have to laugh so loud that people know that you're laughing at him.  Eric, it's just me and you in the room and you heard the joke. 
[03:37:00]  There's nothing else that you learned.  Yeah, but I can hear you through over my headphones from the show because you've got to go...  No, I don't laugh.  And if you're loudly guffawing and slamming the console when somebody who's, I guess, your boss is made fun...  Oh, then it's...  I used to be his assistant no longer.  You quit that joke?  I don't fucking quit that shit.  The way Eric was like, I don't want to be the intern boss anymore.  I'm going to quit.  And then he went to talk to the bosses and then he came out and he was like, yeah, I'm still the intern boss.  You didn't want to be Eric's assistant anymore. 
[03:37:30]  And I made the decision and I stopped being Eric's assistant.  But there are some lines that are really, really fucking good.  Like the other day, Dominic Monaghan was in The Hobbit.  And Ant had this...  I'm not going to remember it correctly, but Ant had this line about the beetle has to get its head cut off and it can only die if it gets starved to death.  And it goes, oh, like E-Rock.  You like that?  I thought that was amazing.  Right.  Like when Eric was telling his movie story.  Well, explain the joke to me.  Why is it...  Well, it would be that the only way to prevent the thing from eating would be to cut its head off. 
[03:38:00]  That wouldn't be enough.  It would still need to die from starvation.  Now, and why would that apply to E-Rock?  Because he's gluttonous.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Anyway, but when Eric was telling his story the other day about the movie, I thought that was the best fucking thing I've heard in months.  Like I thought that was...  That was your favorite break?  Favorite break in many months' time.  Do you think that's legitimate, Eric?  It was a great break.  And why...  But do you...  Why...  What did you like about it, Sal?  Because I love the fact that Eric is taking on something so massive. 
[03:38:30]  Mm-hmm.  Go ahead.  No, you go ahead.  I was going to say not unlike himself.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I wasn't even thinking on that level.  Like Fat Joke didn't even cross my mind that far.  Trying, trying to curry your favor.  Yeah, I just want to be a follower of Sam.  You're like an Indian dish.  Yeah.  Trying to curry my favor?  No, when he starts telling about all the details, none of it makes any sense.  It's such a...  The movie, you're saying.  Yeah.  Eric's movie that he's making. 
[03:39:00]  Right.  And...  And it just makes no sense, you're saying.  And I still can't figure it out.  And I've listened...  What do you...  Do you have sparkles on your fingers?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just put those on.  Okay.  Don't get distracted, Sal.  Stay on focus.  Yeah.  He's going to come in with sparkles on his fingers?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  New trend.  Yeah.  All right.  And it's just such a huge undertaking.  I know Eric is going to do it.  He is.  You think he is going to do it?  I'm going to be so obsessed with this film.  I'm going to...  Do you think he's going to do a very bad job?  No.  You think he's going to do a very good job? 
[03:39:30]  I love Eric.  I really do.  And I think...  Not like that.  Eric.  I think that whatever...  Sal and Eric sitting in a tree.  Whatever Eric puts out, I'm going to follow it like...  E-A-T-I-N-G...  Wait, that's not how the song goes.  Oh, I don't remember it.  Go on, Sal.  Whatever Eric puts out, whether it be just a screenplay, a short film, whatever it is,  I'm going to be obsessed with it.  Why?  Because it's going to be genius.  In what way?  That it's something that Eric has done really...  It's going to be ironic. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't understand.  Are you saying...  Because a minute ago you said you were not saying kind things about him, and now you're  saying he's a genius.  Well, it's...  Because I've never really seen Eric put out something independently creative.  Do you think his work is going to be intentionally genius, or is the genius going to be in what  he doesn't realize he wrote?  Correct.  Like, he won't even realize it.  He's just going to put it out there because this is Eric, and it's going to be...  Do you think it'll be genius in the sense that this is a great idea, or genius in the sense  of, look at this fucking idiot who wrote the screenplay, I'm laughing at him?  A little bit of both.  A little bit of...  Which one would you lean more heavily on? 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, look at this idiot.  Because I don't think Eric can really write anything, but I'm going to worship it.  I know I am.  Because of how stupid it is.  But in a good way.  No, but it may not be...  He doesn't realize.  It may be really good.  It may not be stupid.  But he's...  But it's not going to be good because he knows how to write anything well.  It's going to be stupid because Eric's stupid, and he's going to put out something amazing.  That's like a savantism, sort of.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, he's talking to Fez in there, I think.  I don't know if he heard you.  No, he'll just scroll back and then email the clip to someone.  Let me see what 317 says. 
[03:41:00]  317, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, Sam, I was just wondering why the pad data keeps saying Jennifer Tilly every time  you guys go to break.  It has, like, all weekend.  Is Jennifer Tilly coming on the show today, Eric?  No.  Okay, no.  Is this the same guy on Twitter?  I told you, everything else keeps changing.  No, I'm not on Twitter at all, buddy.  I promise.  I just saw it all weekend when I was listening to the replay.  I was just curious.  That's all.  Is Jennifer Tilly coming on the show?  No.  With Booker.  So that way the pad data will make sense.  Did you hear Sal just say Eric is stupid? 
[03:41:30]  No, I didn't hear that.  Yeah, you should definitely...  I'll take a call, you scroll back, and you can hear yourself.  And then I want your response to that.  631, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Sammy, Sammy, Sammy, this is Richard from Long Island, brother.  What's up, buddy?  Still waiting for my autograph.  That incompetent motherfucker, Sal, can talk my dick.  I would never do that.  And I think everybody on the show would agree with me what he should have to do so I can  listen to the great Sam Roberts on Sunday afternoons in the comfort of my home 
[03:42:00]  and not in my car.  He should send me a home system so I can listen to you guys.  Sal, do you have a home system?  First of all, Richie, I can hear myself in your phone, so I'm going to hang up on you.  I'm sorry about you.  All right.  I'm hanging up on Richie, but I will represent him.  Sure.  Why didn't you send him the autographed ribbon?  It was left out right before Christmas break, and I searched the office the other day.  I just can't find it.  Maybe you should have sent it out before Christmas break.  Yeah, probably.  Probably.  But you didn't, did you?  But no, maybe we can...  Do you have a home unit to send to him? 
[03:42:30]  No, I don't.  I listen.  I use the app.  All right.  Well, I'll tell you what.  Call Mommy.  Mommy.  And have her buy Richie a home unit, okay?  Oh, yeah?  You know what?  What?  You know who my mom saw over this weekend?  Barry Manilow?  I did.  Did she fuck him?  No.  Would she see him in the audience of a concert?  No, he's doing some crap on Broadway, and she, like, waited outside, like, when he walks  out with, like, her phone and shit.  It was so good.  Did she get a picture with him?  No, no.  Did she get wet?  Probably.  Oh, it's your mom.  I know, but she told us she would.  Eric, did you hear the clip? 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, I heard it.  What did you think?  He's calling me a savant.  Yeah, but he said, Eric, he said specifically, his quote was, yes, the movie will be stupid  because Eric is stupid.  Did you know that he, I mean, that's what you said, right, Sal?  Yeah, but he's a stupid savant.  No problem.  Of course.  That's what a savant, I mean, he's, it's like Rain Man.  Yes.  Like, he's really good at counting, like, things that fall on the floor.  Right.  But he's retarded.  Yes.  And that's Eric.  That is Eric Nadeau.  Like, Eric is good at counting ketchup packets. 
[03:43:30]  He knows exactly how many ketchup packets he has, but at everything else, he's brain dead.  Is that what you're saying?  Correct.  Not everything else, but.  But most other things.  But that's why I think when he puts out a creative idea that's solely his, it's independent from  O&A, it's going to be fucking, it's going to blow our minds.  Is your mom listening to this right now?  No.  She'd be fingering herself if she was.  She probably would be.  Eric, do you think you're retarded?  No.  Like Sal does?  No.  Why does he think you're retarded?  Because he thinks he's a young go-getter and up-and-comer.  Does he not know that he is stagnating here already? 
[03:44:00]  No, he has no idea.  He's not self-aware.  Are you not self-aware, Sal?  Apparently not, according to the savant, so.  Not according to me, according to my boss.  Who's your boss, Opie?  Opie.  Oh, yeah.  Tell me about that.  So, Opie, we went over to the Nagels house for a football party.  Cool.  And it was me and my wife.  It was Eric and his wife.  It was Opie and his, and the Opie family.  So, I spent the entire evening, you know, running around Eric's house in a circle, chasing the kid. 
[03:44:30]  And by the way, Eric, I don't know if you guys knew this, but you noticed I didn't catch him.  And I want everybody to know, I was not giving 100%, and I know I could have caught that kid.  He kept slamming the door in your face.  He did keep slamming the door.  I could have stopped him, but I was a bigger man that time.  And Opie Jr., if you're listening, I want you to know that next time, your ass is grass.  I win next time.  Eric, tell me.  You're sitting on the couch with Opie, and you're discussing Sal?  No, we were, he's trying to get me into football, and I have zero interest, right? 
[03:45:00]  Right.  And I said, so, you know, the shows are being good this week.  You were trying to flip down like Honey Boo Boo.  We were talking, no.  Sunday, Simpsons time.  Thundercats.  No.  So, we were just, you know, talking about guests coming up and everything.  And so I brought up, I'm like, how do you think Sal's doing?  And you just, now let me ask you, before you tell me what his response was, out of the  blue, you just turned to Opie, sitting on your couch, and you go, how do you think Sal's  doing?  Yep.  And is that, did you, did you have an idea of what his response would be? 
[03:45:30]  Why else would he ask the question?  I thought maybe his, his tone might have changed.  Maybe he rethought some things, and Sal's really not that bad.  Oh, that's what you were thinking.  You wanted a positive.  You're a good guy, Eric.  You're a good guy.  He's not on the air, so, you know, maybe I'll get the, you know, the real answer.  This is Greg Hughes sitting on your couch.  Yes.  Not Opie, or the Opster.  Yeah.  Opster is my favorite iteration, by the way.  Go on.  So you, so you asked Greg Hughes, so how do you think Sal's doing?  He just made a face. 
[03:46:00]  What was the face?  Like, a smile?  Like, or like a thumbs up?  It was like, well, one, it was, why did you ask me that while I'm watching football?  But two, also kind of puzzled.  And then he goes.  It was like, he made a, he made a face like somebody had just dropped his shit on his lap.  Like, like, I'm really unhappy with this.  Like, what is this?  I ain't confused.  Why would this person drop a shit on my lap?  Yeah.  I understand.  And that was it?  No, and then he goes, he's like, this is Opie talking from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, who?  Okay.  He goes, yeah, we made a mistake.  And then he said, right, Sam, but you, you were chasing the, uh, the kid into the kitchen.  Opie Jr.  Yeah.  And I know I could have caught him if I tried a little harder.  Yeah.  Uh, Sal?  Very upsetting.  I, I, I just got to try harder.  I got to work harder.  You say that sarcastically.  Do you hear his tone, dude?  I'm not saying sarcastically.  You hear his tone, right, Eric?  It seems a bit snarky.  And he goes, um, that's very upsetting.  No, it is upsetting.  Opie, Opie is, is, you know, so important to the show.  So, of course, I want to please him. 
[03:47:00]  He is the show.  It's his name on the wall.  I know, but I'm saying Anthony's there, too.  He has something to do with it.  He's so important to the show.  Without him, it'd be difficult.  He's the show.  I know.  And Anthony's the show and Jim's the show.  There's three parts of the show.  I said that.  And there's the, all three of those guys are the whole show.  The most important element to the show.  No, the show.  Yes.  The only element to the show.  Yes.  Okay.  There you go.  Yeah.  You know, Opie's opinion means a lot to me because without Opie, it'd still be a good  show.  It'd mainly be me and Eric, but it would still be good. 
[03:47:30]  But he is one of the more important parts.  It's the whole show.  It's the only reason Amy listens is those three guys.  And one of them, we haven't even asked the other two, but one of them looked at Eric  and said, yeah, we made a mistake with Sal.  Is that what he said?  Well, I don't want to, that was said, and he did address to you, but you, again, you ran out  of the room, but, you know, I don't want to speak for him.  And, you know, let him say his piece.  No, that's what he said to you, though.  That's what he said to me.  In that, in that instance.  Yeah.  Maybe he's changed his opinion since Sunday night.  No change in tone. 
[03:48:00]  No.  Disappointed.  Yeah.  How does that make you feel, Sal?  And then went right back to the football game.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Now, does that make you feel like all the bashing that you do to E-Rock and Opie turns to E-Rock  and says, Sal is the mistake?  Yeah.  You feel like you got it wrong?  That maybe you should be spending a little more time fixing what's in the mirror and a  little less time fixing what's taking up the two chairs that sit behind you?  I'm not trying to fix Eric.  Wait a minute.  You used to, right?  How dare you? 
[03:48:30]  I don't remember.  I'm not in the office with you.  See, you've got to work something in like that.  I don't know.  The other thing is I don't like being touched in the workplace either.  Eric, did you touch Sal?  No, he wants me to touch him.  That's disgusting, Sal.  Oh, I don't know.  I think there are two witnesses of something.  Who?  What are you talking about?  Eric, are you having a physical relationship or is Sal?  No, I think he wants one.  Is he just going down a weird road because he's stuck?  The thing is, it's just like when he said, you know, him and Opie have a relationship.  They talk.  They hang out.  Whether or not Eric jerked you off in the office or that was just something you were looking for. 
[03:49:00]  Eric didn't touch me sexually at all.  It was violent.  Okay, well, whether it was sexually violent or whatever it was that you're looking for  does not change the fact, and I think there's probably just some weird shit going on in  your head, but Opie's disappointed that you were the hire.  Yeah, I know.  I have to turn things around to make him...  Are you going to or are you just going to be like...  I have to figure out what it is still.  You know, it's going to be something big.  It's got to be something really good.  Are you going to do a bit?  I don't know if that's the way...  Yeah, maybe probably something... 
[03:49:30]  What's really big?  I don't know.  That's the thing.  I have to really just break through.  I don't know what it's going to be.  Eric, is there an ounce of legitimacy in what Sal's talking to me about right now?  That he wants to do a bit?  Yeah, I don't know what he's doing.  I'm not denying that.  I'm sure he does.  I'm not saying I want to do a bit per se.  I need to do something to break through.  Uh-oh.  Truth police is here.  This is a guy who I count on.  Because sometimes I get lost in these conversations that happen in here.  And it gets very difficult to keep up with everything. 
[03:50:00]  Thank God Troy Kwan is listening in the other room to keep everybody in check and let me know what's up sometimes.  Because you can tell.  Like, sometimes I'm like, what the fuck?  You got Sal talking about Eric jerking him off for whatever reason.  Eric did not jerk me off.  I don't know what he did, but I don't want to know because I don't want to be roped into that little sexual fantasy you have going on with Eric touching you.  You have him over here saying, one minute he's saying Eric's stupid, the next minute he's saying he's a genius.  Eric is pointing out, Eric's opinion is this.  Sal says things about Eric because he wants to impress me and the other guys. 
[03:50:30]  And, OB directly told Eric we made a mistake with Sal.  What are you thinking?  I know how Sal could win back the favor of OB.  This is important to Sal.  This is huge.  Because, like Sal said, OB is one of many parts of the show.  Right?  OB is the show.  Anthony and Jim don't like Sal, let's be honest.  Anthony doesn't like him.  Jim thinks it's funny that he gets on everybody's nerves. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  You know how Sal could win this show back.  Yeah.  How's that?  Okay, so we're doing this new contest.  The gay off.  The gay off.  The first annual gay off.  Is that guy pissing?  He looks like he's pissing.  What?  That guy, he's just.  The new intern just had his back to me in the corner.  He looked like you.  Don't piss in here.  I know Sal hasn't told you all the rules of him in here, but both of you.  No pissing in the studio, okay?  Or on each other?  Yeah, you can piss on each other.  Just do it in the bathroom.  And don't tell me about it.  Okay. 
[03:51:30]  You know how we need a gay guy to do this?  Yeah, we need a gay guy to do this.  Because the gay off is happening.  You go to SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  But the gist is that we need guys who are married.  You need to prove that you're married.  And you need to come in here with your wife.  And you need to get gayed on by a gay dude while your wife's in the room.  And whoever lets the gay guy gay on them the most will win like $1,500.  So if you think you can enter that contest, go to SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[03:52:00]  Now, Troy, you see a way that Sal could use this contest to get into Opie's good graces.  This will win Opie back.  I guarantee it.  Well, how does he do it?  We need a gay guy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's Sal.  Sal!  And before it happens, Sal fully comes out of the closet.  Okay.  On the air.  On the air, he's like, guys, I'm out, I'm gay.  This gay off is happening before long. 
[03:52:30]  I mean, all entries need to be in by the 1st of February.  That's not much time.  That's not much time at all, Eric.  I mean, it's already the 22nd of January.  It's just a shade over a week away.  So, Sal.  Sal walks into the room, completely shaven, oiled.  Oiled.  G-string.  Has a robe on.  Oh.  Takes his robe off in front of everybody on the show and says,  I have an announcement to make, I'm gay.  Or he could have a G-string, and since he was talking to us on the air about how enormous 
[03:53:00]  his package is, remember when he said that?  Yeah.  He could have a thing down his package that says,  my name is Sal, and I want to let you guys know that I am a homosexual.  I'm officially out of the closet.  And it could just be going down his cock.  And then he says, let the games begin, and rings the bell.  Sal?  You ready to get back into Opie's favor?  I would be willing to initiate the competition, but I'm not gay.  Step one.  I'm not gay, so I'm not going to come out because that would be a phallacy.  Step one, Sal, we're all, we're all, first of all, we don't need to talk about any more 
[03:53:30]  phalluses.  You know, I mean, that's your thing.  Step two.  What I need from you.  We're all your friends here.  Let's get this thing started.  Yeah.  So, Troy's here, the new interns, Eric, Pips from Ron and Fez.  Yes.  We're all here for you, Sal.  I think there's something you'd like to tell us.  Go ahead.  I'm not gay.  Okay.  Well, he's not even.  I mean, he's still.  I would do something in the gay fashion of, like, shaving and oiled up to, like, you know, 
[03:54:00]  ring the bell.  What if maybe, okay, so he wants to do something, like, oily and shaved in the gay fashion.  He wants to ring a bell.  Maybe if we get the gay entertainer to do some of his moves onto Sal before the game starts  to demo.  Like, yeah, demonstration.  Or Sal could come out in a thong.  Of course.  And then he warms up the gay guy. 
[03:54:30]  Like, almost like he's the fluffer.  Yeah.  And he'll come out and he'll kind of massage them up.  You know what?  Loosen them up.  Even to the point where the gay guy could be sitting there going, well, this list of things,  because, like we said, for this gay off that's going down in a few weeks, again, you've got  to enter this contest if you want to win the $1,500.  But, uh, and the email, by the way, is opanthony at SiriusXM.com.  Some of the events are like, you know, feather games.  Okay, well, what's that?  You know, like, uh, manscaping.  Okay, well, what do you mean by that?  So you have Sal to show the entertainer what we mean by this by doing it to him. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah.  And the entertainer would really get a kick out of it because he's a gay entertainer.  The intern has an idea.  You can pipe in.  What's your name, intern?  Uh, my name's Alan.  Alan, the new intern.  Alan Thicke.  Well, we could, uh, actually prove that Sal is gay pretty easily.  How's that?  Well, we can hook up a tumescence monitor onto him.  You listen to a lot of Dr. Steve?  No, I never listen to Dr. Steve.  Me neither.  He's heard terrible things, so.  But we can hook up a tumescence monitor to Sal. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  Then have the gay guy come in, do his thing on Sal, and then we can actually measure if,  you know, Sal gets a little bit of blood down to his penis.  Sal, do you think Alan Thicke has a good idea?  If it proves that I'm not gay, I mean, that...  Well, that's not what it's going to prove.  I think we both know that.  So what would it just prove?  It just proves...  What if it proves you're gay?  Yeah, it proves you get hard as well as you come out?  No, because I'm not gay.  But if it shows that you're gay, though, that means...  He's just sitting there with a giant rod going, look, I like girls, what can I say? 
[03:56:00]  I think we're on to something.  I think that you, Sal, should, you know, maybe touch the entertainer so he knows what to do.  So I need to show him initially what he will do.  Gay actions are...  Like, for instance, this says soft kissing on the neck, on the ears, et cetera.  Uh, no.  And then the entertainer would be like, well, how soft is soft?  No, no, no.  And then Sal would be like, in his thong and his boa, would be like, let me show you how soft soft is. 
[03:56:30]  No, no, no.  Something like that.  You could do that.  No, I could, but I wouldn't.  Oh, so you don't mind if Opie hates you?  That, I don't think that's going to render me...  Eric, you've been here a long time.  Wouldn't Opie love Sal a lot more if he would kiss the guy?  I think it's a good start.  It's for the show.  It's for the show, after all.  Yeah.  I mean, Opie put shit on his face with a baby diaper.  With a baby diaper.  I'd much rather do that than do some gay shit.  Why?  Because you might realize something about yourself?  No.  So you can't pick what it is.  Right.  If you're going out trying to win Opie back, man. 
[03:57:00]  It's the list.  And they're just soft kisses.  It's not tongue.  Yeah.  Maybe some massaging.  Well, yeah.  One of the items on the list is oiled massages with a G-string on, and you'd be wearing a G-string.  See, that to me is less gay than kissing him.  You massage his back.  You kind of rub your pelvis.  Genitalia.  Your genitalia on him.  Through the thong, of course.  It's just because it's just for fun.  And then, while you're massaging him, then you can drop the soft kisses. 
[03:57:30]  So you're not really showing Opie, if you don't want to do this, that you're ready to step up.  Just a really sexy earlobe nibble?  Something like that?  Yeah.  While you're massaging?  Troy, can you imagine if you were getting a massage from a lady?  She's using oils, very soft.  All of a sudden, she started nibbling your ears.  It'd be nice.  You'd enjoy that, wouldn't you?  Absolutely.  So why wouldn't we show our entertainer some thanks?  Show him a good time.  And thank you for helping us with this bit that we're putting together, the first annual  gay off.  If he wants to be...  Brought to you by Steven Singer.  If we want him to perform well, we need Sal to warm him up. 
[03:58:00]  Right.  You need a fluffer.  Right.  It's like, this guy comes in here, and it's just a room that is just flooded.  With guys like Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton and me, just flooding with heterosexuality.  Right.  And he's like, I feel so out of place here.  And we're like, don't worry about it.  But Sal's going to come in, and he's going to make you feel a little more comfortable.  Yeah.  Would you be willing to do that?  Just make our entertainer feel a little bit more comfortable?  Break the ice, if you will.  Maybe like massage the butt cheeks? 
[03:58:30]  No.  Because it's a thong.  Pectoral muscles?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rub lotion on his pectorals?  No, no, no.  No, it's not...  I don't want to do that.  See, Sal, you're not willing to step up.  You're not willing to step up.  He doesn't want to do it.  Would you do this?  Yeah.  If I was trying to win Opie back in my good graces, sure.  Why not?  Opie gave an intern's mother a lap dance.  It's for the show.  For the show.  Don't bring your moms in here, interns.  Just don't do it.  Troy did the bed thing with Ian Halpern.  Troy got into bed nude, hard, with Ian Halpern. 
[03:59:00]  You were erect, right?  Yeah.  Sure.  He got into bed with Ian Halpern, with his clothes off.  Not only did he do that, but he asked if he could.  He asked Ian Halpern permission.  When Ian Halpern, you remember, His Highness Hollywood, was doing the bed-in to promote  his book that he told us a lot of press was going to.  But as it turned out, it was just me and Troy in there with Ian Halpern.  And some other weird guy.  And some weird guy just sitting in a chair.  In silence.  You remember when we went to that room, we were like, this is weird, right?  Yeah. 
[03:59:30]  There was no music playing.  No.  It was just silence.  No.  Not a hint of press.  Nope.  And at the end of the whole thing, Ian goes, hey, Sam, get into bed and we'll take  a picture.  And so I left my shoes on, my pants on, all my clothes on, over the covers, and just  kind of got next to him and then ran off the bed.  Troy goes, you think I can get a picture too?  Ian goes, of course.  Troy goes, is it cool if I take my clothes off?  And Ian goes, yeah, get in.  And Troy took off all his clothes and jumped down to the covers with Ian Halpern. 
[04:00:00]  Why?  It's a goof.  It's funny.  It's for the show.  It's for the show, you know?  How did you get hard before you got in bed?  I just kind of give a few tugs.  Yeah.  Exactly.  He's not going to, he's going to show up if he's going to show up.  Yeah.  You know?  That's what you need to do.  Maybe I can get involved with it somehow, but I just, the certain things are kind of  not.  I can picture Sal not owning it too.  Yeah.  He'd go into it and be like, all right, fine, I'll do it.  And then it just cheeses out.  Right.  No, I mean, if I'm going to commit to it, I'll commit to it.  But there are certain things like, I'm not going to, I'm not going to kiss the guy. 
[04:00:30]  Why not?  I've kissed three men.  On the lips.  Troy, how many men have you?  One of them was homeless.  One of them was homeless.  I didn't know who he was and I haven't seen him since.  The other was Bob Kelly and he's threatened rape on me.  And the third was an intern.  And you sucked a dildo.  I did.  I sucked a dildo while it hung out of E-Rock's pants.  See, Sam stepped up to the plate.  I stepped up to the fucking plate.  Okay?  And you know what happens?  Yeah.  Me and E-Rock get invited to hang out with Opie and be in the room while he sits there and  says you were the mistake. 
[04:01:00]  That's what happened.  And we're trying to fix this for you and you're doing nothing but just shitting on  our ideas.  No, it's not a bad idea to get involved with the gay office.  All you got to do is a little gay.  You'd be surprised how much these hosts like you.  A little gay will get you far away.  Just get a little gay involved.  Yeah.  Gay is funny.  Yeah.  That's showbiz.  That's showbiz, right, Eric?  Eric has been through it all.  All right, well, I'll think about it.  You think he didn't give Scott Shannon some kind of handy or something?  He didn't tug his balls a little bit?  Eric had to probably do sexual favors for Scott Shannon.  It's called working your way up the ladder.  Right.  You're at the bottom of the totem pole. 
[04:01:30]  I know.  That's right.  And you're not winning any favors back either.  You know what happens when you're at the bottom of the totem pole?  You know what the quickest way to climb up it is?  Get your mouth on that totem pole.  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying, right, Troy?  Yeah.  He's not going to commit.  It's going to be, he'll say he's going to do something, and they'll be like, so I'll do  this, and he won't do it.  It's just going to ruin the whole thing.  Well, you got to do it.  You would have to.  No, if I'm going to say I'm going to do it, yeah.  And you're saying you're going to do it.  Yeah, but then he'll be like, well, I agree to do this.  I'm not doing this. 
[04:02:00]  Manscaping.  Touching genitals over underwear.  Like, you're just, you're not going to have anything into your ass.  You know that.  You're not going to have to suck a dick.  You know that.  We can't put a dick in your ass.  We can't put a dick in your mouth.  I mean, here.  You can do whatever you want outside of here.  So, like, what's the worst that could possibly happen from that?  You have a point, yeah.  You can't drink cum.  You know.  Well, you can, but not in here.  No, I wouldn't do that.  Well, I mean, that's not for me to judge.  This is coming from the guy who's got, you know, nail polish on right now.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, shit.  You know why?  Why? 
[04:02:30]  Because I'm fucking confident enough to wear it.  I've got glitter nail polish on three of my fingernails.  Jess put it on as a goof, and then she was like, you want me to take it off?  And you know what I said?  No.  Pendulet wears nail polish.  Exactly.  You're going to make fun of Pendulet?  No.  Most rock stars do.  Exactly.  He's got red sparkles.  You know why?  Sparkles.  Because I'm not sitting there going on Hypebeast and other fucking Brooklyn hipster websites  and trying to figure out what I'm supposed to wear now.  I don't even know what Hypebeast is.  We know about you.  Exactly.  We know about you.  Do you?  Woo! 
[04:03:00]  I'm my own man.  I'm confident in me.  That's fantastic.  You.  That's good.  Are not.  You're not confident enough to give a male entertainer an oil massage.  I'll do it.  There it is.  Yeah, but no.  The whole list.  But follow through with everything.  Anything that they come up with.  Right.  The hosts come up with anything that they want to do.  You've got to follow through with it.  You're his gay boy toy for the morning.  You can't say you commit to it now, and then they come up with some shit, and you're like,  oh, no.  I'm not doing that.  I'm not doing that.  You have to do it.  Will you do it? 
[04:03:30]  You're the gay boy toy for the morning.  You'll, you need to grow a handlebar mustache.  Yeah, of course.  Obviously.  And you need to come in here completely shaved and oiled.  Yeah.  Body.  Maybe some bronzer.  It wouldn't hurt.  Maybe completely bronzered up.  Yeah, it really wouldn't hurt.  Right.  Yeah.  But definitely a handlebar mustache.  Definitely you've got to shave your body hair, because the guy's going to like a twink.  Who doesn't like a twink?  I think Sal should get his whole body waxed.  Oof.  That would be great.  Yeah.  That would be great.  It's easier than shaving.  It's quicker.  Yeah.  Well, somebody come in, wax them down.  Right.  And the pubis, too. 
[04:04:00]  Yeah.  Brazilian wax, too.  Yeah, asshole.  I don't know.  That's crazy.  So, you'll be the boy toy for the morning?  So, you're committing to a wax?  Let's get him to commit to the morning before he commits to the wax.  Yeah, because then that allows a lot more.  The wax, I think we can work with.  Will you commit to boy toy sexual favors for the morning?  Of the gay off.  And whatever the hosts want you to do.  Will you do it?  I just feel it's going to get out of hand.  Will you do it?  You can't.  You're not going to get your ass penetrated. 
[04:04:30]  You're not going to have to suck a cock.  I know, but I might have to put my nose in the guy's ass or something like that.  If you want to step up for the show, you've got to do it.  Exactly.  Eric's done that before.  Eric has done it before.  Eric has had his face in a man's ass before.  Have you not, Eric?  I believe I'm...  I've done so much, I probably have.  That's right.  All right.  I'll do it.  All right.  We'll see.  First step.  Now I'll do it.  And now that you've agreed to doing that, is there something you'd like to tell us?  No.  Okay.  Will you, will you, this like, abolish it?  Just think about it.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[04:05:00]  Just, don't have to say it now, but when the time comes, just think about it.  Pull it over.  Steven Singer's going to be happy about this.  Yeah.  Ah, Steven Singer.

[04:06:30]  You ready to do this, Sal?  Yeah, I'm thinking about it now.  Yeah, I'm okay with it.  And we can do the wax as well.  Yeah, the wax.  Yeah, that sounds good.  You'll do the whole wax everything.  The Brazilian wax.  Yeah, we'll do it.  Yeah, just do it.  You have to do your ass?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  You gotta get in there.  That's obvious.  Girls do it every day.  It's fine.  They love it.  I mean, if a girl can do it.  Are you a girl?  Are you a man?  Yeah, exactly.  It's like, you know.  I guess, yeah.  Like, here's the question.  Are you pussy?  No.  All right, so we'll do the wax stuff.  Cool.  So Sal's gonna get a full Brazilian wax.  Yeah. 
[04:07:00]  And then he's gonna be the fluffer to the gay guy.  Right.  And if the gay guy wants to touch you up, he's gonna touch you up.  And I'll be goddamned if that doesn't win Obi back.  Yeah.  If it doesn't, then...  You have to think of something else.  Yeah, exactly.  Back to the drawing board.  Troy and me...  Then you can call Troy and me done.  Yeah.  Okay, that's the next video.  We'll go back to the drawing board for next time.  Right.  But I think it'll work, Sal.  Are you excited?  I'm not excited, but I'm excited...  Physically, I mean.  Are you aroused?  I'm not aroused.  Okay.  Roland, are you looking very excited?  Yeah, I am.  You look almost aroused, not because of the sexual stuff that's going on, but just the 
[04:07:30]  humiliation that Sal is gonna have to endure is actually enough to physically arouse  you.  Yeah, I'm hard.  You are right now.  I am so hard right now.  You're about to come.  I'm about to.  Eric.  Sorry, I was marking that down.  No, it's okay.  Are you excited?  I'm just eating breakfast.  I'm very excited.  You are.  You're pumped.  Yes.  This is a great opportunity.  It's gonna be great.  That's what it is.  It's an opportunity for you, Sal.  And it's a great opportunity.  The new young interns have been watching you this whole time. 
[04:08:00]  Yeah.  And they've really gotten to see you display leadership over the course of this last 40  minutes or so.  Just really show that, you know, Sal is a guy who will stand up for what he believes in.  Take the bull by the horns.  He'll take the bull by the horns.  And Obama gave him a shout out.  Oh, President Obama gave Sal a shout out.  Yeah.  When was that?  When he said, like, go gays.  Yeah.  Oh, that's true.  My gay brothers.  So, you got the President on your back.  You know what I mean?  Wow, he's not on your back, literally.  You know what I mean?  He's got your back.  Yeah.  The President is a happily married man.  He's gonna need to start growing his handlebar mustache. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah, I'm cool with that.  Like, I gotta...  You gotta be cool with everything.  You're doing everything.  Right.  The handlebar mustache is totally fine.  All the way down, though.  Yeah.  Like Food Manchu.  That's not a handlebar.  Handlebar is like what your dad's got.  No, no, no.  That's Raleigh fingers.  Yeah.  Handlebars.  Sometimes those handlebars go down.  Oh, okay.  The Hulk Hogan.  Almost like Hulk Hogan.  Yeah.  We want a Hogan.  Okay.  Yeah.  And we want you to do the reverse Hogan, though.  We want you to grow in some stubble and bleach it.  And then you have that dark mustache and the bleach.  Can you do that?  Well, we'll see if it works.  I think you should start with a James Hetfield, where it goes down and it goes up into his mustache. 
[04:09:00]  Oh, like Lemmy.  Lemmy, yeah.  Yeah.  Start with that, and then that day comes and he goes into a handlebar.  Yeah.  Cuts off those chops.  Yeah.  You excited?  To really make your mark on this show, finally?  Yes.  For that, yes.  But not necessarily for the things I have to do for it.  It would be pretty humiliating.  No.  You've got to step up to the plate.  I know.  That's what I said.  We'll do it.  All right.  Listen.  That's all the time we have for today.  I want to find out what...  Opie said today we're getting a taste of Martha's studio.  I don't believe that. 
[04:09:30]  I believe that if they were going to tear down this wall, they would just give us the  whole studio.  We're probably just getting the lamp.  Yeah, exactly.  They'll bring the desk in from in there.  So that we'll continue to find out as the days go on.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are next.  To enter the gay off, go to SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony or email us at Opie  and Anthony at SiriusXM.com.  Married men, you probably won't have to do half of what Sal's going to have to do.
