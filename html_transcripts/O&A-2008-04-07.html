<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton grappling with technical difficulties, specifically an echo on the broadcast. Norton's irritable mood, stemming from a pinched nerve and a subsequent argument with his girlfriend, contributed to the overall atmosphere.  The show then launched into a game where the hosts attempted to guess Anthony's weekend getaway location, using cryptic clues about air travel, a layover, and watching *The Office* on his laptop.  Listener speculation, fueled by hints on Paltalk and details about Continental Airlines flights from LaGuardia, eventually led to the correct answer: Cleveland, Ohio.  This was followed by a discussion of a *Page Six* article about Colin Quinn allegedly pushing Jerry Seinfeld's car, an article which also mentioned Opie and Anthony.

Colin Quinn then joined the show in studio.  The conversation shifted to a review of *Rock the Cradle*, focusing on the singing abilities (or lack thereof) and appearance of Olivia Newton-John's daughter, Chloe Latanzi.  The hosts also promoted a YouTube video showing the graphic aftermath of scraping the tongue of a guest with extremely bad breath ("Big A").  Discussion of Anthony's trip continued, along with a recurring segment featuring audio clips from the radio personality Scorch.  This segment also included discussion of Charlton Heston's death, which transitioned into a comedic, albeit crude and graphic, impersonation of Heston suffering from Alzheimer's.  Jim Jefferies called in to promote his stand-up shows.  The horrifically bad breath of "Big A" was discussed further, detailing the staff's reaction and the aforementioned YouTube video. The segment concluded with a playback of Rich Voss's terrible acting performance alongside Chaz Palminteri.

The next segment featured a conversation with Dr. Michio Kaku, author of "Physics of the Impossible."  Opie, Anthony, Norton, and Quinn engaged Dr. Kaku in a discussion about time travel, wormholes, the multiverse, and other physics concepts, punctuated by jokes and tangents referencing *Back to the Future* and other pop culture elements.  Dr. Kaku explained Einstein's theory of time and the concept of "closed time-like loops,"  the energy requirements for time travel, and the feasibility of invisibility using metamaterials. The conversation also delved into more personal topics, including the hostsâ€™ opinions on Dr. Kaku's theories, the Second Amendment, and a bizarre anecdote about foot-care products.

A substantial portion of the show was devoted to the return of The Greaseman to DC 101.  Clips of The Greaseman's show were played, highlighting his rambling stories and song parodies. His past controversies, including an incident involving dragging things behind trucks, were discussed, along with the mixed reactions to his comeback. This was followed by another segment featuring Scorch, whose sexually suggestive top five lists and other bizarre radio bits were played and analyzed by the hosts and Colin Quinn. An attempted call with Bob Kelly was hampered by technical difficulties and tangents. Kelly's recently released CD/DVD, "Just a Tip," and his thank-you list (which notably placed Opie and Anthony far down the list) became the subject of heated commentary.


The final segment focused on the "Line of the Day" segment, sponsored by AshleyMadison.com, featuring numerous runner-up lines and crude jokes from Opie, Anthony, and Colin Quinn.  The banter included insults, personal attacks, sexual innuendo, and mockery of various people and situations.  Quinn's physical comedy, particularly his struggle with headphone wires, was a recurring element.  The conversation touched upon Quinn's career, gambling habits, and other tangents, including impressions of Charlton Heston and Andrew Dice Clay. Bobby, a member of the show's team, was repeatedly referenced and mocked. The segment concluded with further promotion of the ONA animation festival.  Young Sam, who interned for Scorch, provided commentary and anecdotes throughout various Scorch-related segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hello. Hello. Hello. What happened? I don't know. Where's the big intro?  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk Show Radio Hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I want to pet a deer.  Go petting zoo, you dummy.  I want to pet a deer.  This weekend, I went to a lesbian bar. 
[00:01:00]  Were they making out and stuff?  Yeah, there was some making out.  What did it smell like when one of them burped?  An old tackle box.  Where entertainment is going?  Larry King gets confused when Fran Drescher starts speaking Spanish.  The power of Christ compels you.  She's speaking in tongues, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the...  Oh, we got to deal with an echo, too?  What?  Hey.  Hey.  Sleepy House FM.  Your oldie station.  What?  What?  There's an echo.  What?  Echo, echo, echo.  A little bit.  Wait, do I have one?  I don't think I have one.  I think you just have one.  That's done?  I fixed it. 
[00:02:00]  Do you want an echo, too?  Here.  No, I don't.  Hey.  Have fun with the echo.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Yeah.  I don't have much of an echo.  I want more echo.  Eh.  No.  No.  Is that echoey?  Echo.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Jimmy, you don't get an echo.  Sorry.  No.  I want an echo.  Echo.  I don't have one, either.  All right.  Turn off the effing echo.  Either.  Got a radio show to do.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:30]  Good morning.  You got Opie.  You got Anthony.  And you got the old man that is known as Jim Norton.  Aw.  Just walking in like a crotchety old man today.  I am in pain.  Poor Jimmy.  Now we know what it takes to get you in here early.  You got to get a pinched nerve in your neck and we get to see Jim nice and early in the  morning.  Yeah.  Pinched nerve in my neck.  And my girlfriend and I just snip at each other.  I went to bed at 12 last night. 
[00:03:00]  I'm like, I went out to dinner with her and Colin last night to eat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm like, I was just annoyed at her.  Dinner with the Nortons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why were you annoyed at her?  Just snipped at each other.  It was really stupid.  A snip snip?  Yeah.  Nothing heavy, but it just really annoyed me.  Mm-hmm.  And I'm like, ugh.  I feel it getting heated, so I'm like, I'm going to bed.  You guys are just snipping at each other? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Was it based on anything?  Not really, no.  Insecurity.  Nonsense.  Oh, boy.  This one was her fault, though.  Oh.  This one was.  That's good to hear.  Many of them are mine, but this one was her fault.  That's nice to hear, though.  And I had a pinched neck, and I was cranky, and I'd just eaten a full meal.  So at 12 o'clock, I laid down, and I looked at the clock again at 5.15, and I realized,  well, you haven't slept a wink.  You've been laying here.  Oh.  You've been laying in bed for four hours, and it's just like, it's hot under the sheets.  You can't get comfortable.  It was, I tinkled like 40 times. 
[00:04:00]  Oh.  Just kept getting up and going to the bathroom.  And I was like, saying, like, my neck is so sore from the gym, I pinched something.  Like, I can't look up over my head, and normally, I would never want to look up over my head.  Yeah, there's nothing up there for you.  But now, I'm obsessed with it.  Like, I want to look like there's a plane or a helicopter hovering over me.  You have to look.  All morning, we're just going to go, hey, Jimmy, look up.  Wow.  And I will.  Try looking up.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  It just goes, ow.  I couldn't sleep.  I couldn't lay there. 
[00:04:30]  It was terrible.  That's awful.  So you came in to bother us.  Well, yeah.  A little early.  Yes.  I saw on the prep sheet, we had somebody interesting today, so I said, I better get in.  Ah, yes.  Dr. Kaku is coming by to say hi.  He's all about time travel and black holes and strength theories.  Yeah.  I'm into that time travel stuff.  I want to talk to him about that.  I just want to know if I could go back in time and punch myself in the face.  That's all I want to do with a time machine.  Any rare.  That's the only thing I want to do.  Many occasions.  I want to do. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, let me play this.  Where did Anthony go this weekend?  Oh, no.  Where could he have gone?  He could have gone to Columbine.  Maybe he flew to Auschwitz.  He could have gone any place in the world.  Jet center Anthony.  Where did Anthony go this weekend?  He's never been there before.  Maybe he flew to San Francisco.  Where did Anthony go this weekend?  Where could he have been?  This always seems to be the question on Monday. 
[00:05:30]  Gee, I really look forward to this.  Where did you go this weekend?  Well, it involved aircraft.  You flew again?  It did involve aircraft.  Let's see.  I won't give a compass heading.  But, yes, I departed Continental.  It was Continental Airlines.  No, I left out of...  Shut up, you. 
[00:06:00]  LaGuardia.  I left out of LaGuardia.  Flew Continental from LaGuardia.  Did you lay over anywhere or no?  Was it nonstop?  Laying over was the whole gimmick.  That was the reason for going.  I actually, at one point, was on the plane on PalTalk.  Really?  Until, you know, they tell you to shut your crap off because it makes the plane crash.  What day did you fly out?  Friday?  I was out on Friday. 
[00:06:30]  I was back on Sunday.  Sunday, how early?  Sunday, pretty early.  I'll give you a clue.  The flight was delayed.  Oh, very interesting.  So I had to wait a little in the President's Club, which is very nice.  But, yeah, delayed a little bit.  So I didn't get in until about six-ish or so last night, around there.  Not bad.  How many movies did you see on the flight? 
[00:07:00]  Oh, let me...  Wow, you almost got me there.  You came really...  Oh, did you come close?  See, one day I'm going to slip.  One day I am going to slip up.  Ah, movies on the flight.  Well, I had my computer with me, so I was just tinkering.  And you know how I enjoy sleeping on the plane because, like Dr. Kaku talks about, it's like  time travel for me when you sleep.  You shut your eyes, you open them, instantly you're transported to some faraway or not so 
[00:07:30]  faraway land.  Lucky you, because I spend the whole time listening to every dumb little noise that you hear.  I've become a good sleeper on the plane.  Yeah, you're lucky.  I could just nod my head.  But I sleep during takeoff now, which I used to, like, kind of watch, you know, make sure  everything's kind of rolling right.  Now I just plop my head again, because, of course, first class board's first.  So while the riffraff is coming in, I like putting my head down by the window with a little 
[00:08:00]  pillow.  And then I'm out.  And the next thing I know, they're telling me, put your goddamn seat up.  Put your goddamn seat up.  We're landing.  Yeah.  I go, oh, that was nice.  No.  And they go, no, in the water.  We're ditching the aircraft.  What did you watch on your laptop?  Let's see.  I'm not asking for, like, time.  You want a time thing here.  No, not really.  Actually, it doesn't really matter, because I could have watched the movie and then screwed  around on the computer a little bit and slept and stuff like that.  What did you watch on your computer as you were flying somewhere this weekend? 
[00:08:30]  Let me think.  I watched a couple of episodes of The Office.  That's at least an hour.  And what else?  That was probably it.  No.  I'm going for a long flight.  No.  Yes, Jimmy's hoofed.  Question.  Was it a nonstop?  Yes, indeed.  It was a nonstop.  He's not doing layovers.  Look at Jimmy.  He's going, mm. 
[00:09:00]  You're not doing layovers.  Really?  Nah.  Passport involved?  I don't, um.  Passport involved?  That's a great question.  Passport involved?  That is a good, good question, and I am not going to answer it.  Did he get a stamp?  A stamp for?  Leaving.  Leaving, uh, the United States border?  Not answering that, huh?  I will not answer the passport question.  I was asked that yesterday, also on Pal Talk, and I will not answer the passport question. 
[00:09:30]  Interesting.  Interesting.  No, I didn't go to Branson, Missouri.  Well.  Why would I go to Branson, Missouri?  People come up with all kinds of wacky things.  They always think I'm in Vegas, too.  They always think I went to Vegas.  Well, uh, any other clues?  Did he gamble?  Uh.  Casino gambling?  No.  I almost had one of Jimmy's jokes.  It's always a gamble, isn't it?  No.  Uh, no, no gambling with money. 
[00:10:00]  Nothing like that.  All right.  Yeah.  So, it was just for the, uh, huh-huh.  Huh-huh.  Well, it was, you know, fun.  Went out.  Of course it's fun.  Some bars.  You're single flying all over the freaking country for a hoo-ha.  Possibly all over the world at this point.  I might go to France.  I'm thinking Passport.  When are you going to go to France?  I don't know.  I heard, uh, we're hated there.  That's kind of good.  That's not why you would go to France.  Do you know this show is international? 
[00:10:30]  I understand that.  It really is.  This show has fans all over the globe.  You went from not leaving your house to flying every weekend.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Pretty much.  Good for you.  Very happy for you.  Thanks.  Jimmy, you got a question?  I did have a question.  Don't move me back too much.  I did have it.  But I can't remember it.  Maybe it's written up on the ceiling.  Take a look.  Yeah, go look.  I think it's up there.  He's got a look.  I think you got a post-it up there, Jimmy.  Look, look up there. 
[00:11:00]  Ow.  It peaches.  So you, um, so you flew somewhere.  You needed a passport.  And it was about two hours at least.  No one just watches two episodes in The Office.  I didn't say I needed a passport.  If you watch two episodes of The Office, that's what?  22 minutes apiece.  That's 44 minutes.  It takes you a few minutes before you load the thing.  And, you know, they make you turn it off, what, a good 15 minutes before you land.  So I'm thinking your flight was at least an hour and 20 minutes. 
[00:11:30]  An hour and 20?  At least.  Minimum.  So now we have to just draw a circle from where you live on Long Island and where you  could go within an hour and a half, two hours.  That's what I'm thinking.  Well, get the map out, put a pin in it with, uh...  Did you need a coat where you went?  Something.  Oh, that's good.  Um, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So he went north.  Because it was pretty nice this weekend.  Okay.  All right.  He went north.  That's obvious.  We have a celebrity guest. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  I just received a text from Colin, who's apparently listening.  Uh, Dachau.  Tell him.  Uh, Dachau.  Just tell Colin to come in.  Why is he playing from home like that?  Yeah.  Colin made the news today.  Colin made page six today.  Is that all you're going to give us on your weekend?  Uh, yeah.  I think that's more than I've ever fessed up to.  Really? 
[00:12:30]  Why is Colin in page six?  Was she hot at least?  With a lull?  Come on.  What do you think I'm doing here?  All right.  Uh, we made page six.  Colin Quinn made page six.  Robert Kelly made page six.  Jerry Seinfeld made page six.  Right.  Uh.  All in bold type is, uh, the thing about page six.  Uh, that is when, when, uh, you're reading the article on page six, the entertainment thing.  And, uh, they tell little gossipy stories and all that crap. 
[00:13:00]  But as you're reading through all of a sudden, whoa, there's a name.  It's in bold type.  Yeah.  All the celebrities names are in bold type.  No matter how little they have to do with the story.  Right.  Like it could be, uh, somebody was driving past Jerry Seinfeld's house.  Like he's not even part of the story.  Right.  But they'll bold type his name.  Well, we didn't get bold.  Uh, of course we didn't.  We didn't get the bold type because, uh, page six hates our cuts.  They cannot stand this show. 
[00:13:30]  They're kind of, not kind of, they're in bed with Howard Stern.  Yeah.  And because of the awful things we've said about Howard over the years, they can't stand us.  So when they, when they're forced to write about us, it's in very, very tiny font.  I'm surprised they don't just, uh, lighten it up.  Well, they put it.  Instead of make it bold, they lighten it up a little bit.  I like the way he wrote it.  He went on the XM radio show, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  In quotes, in quotes.  So it's not really the Opie and Anthony show.  It's in quotes.  It's not bold type.  Even stupid Bob Kelly got his name in bold type in that whole thing. 
[00:14:00]  It's a jalopy pushers.  Jerry Seinfeld really didn't have luck in the cars department last week.  Just three days after flipping his Fiat in the Hamptons, his pals had to help him restart his Porsche on Mineta Lane in Greenwich Village.  Comic Colin Quinn went on the XM radio show Opie and Anthony Friday morning and told the host he was tired from giving Seinfeld's car.  The old jumpstart.  Fellow funny man, Robert Kelly chimed in, yeah, he had Colin push one of his 38 Porsches down a side street. 
[00:14:30]  That's it.  I like the fact, too, that when Jerry comes in, he goes on right in front of Colin.  And Colin will try to make it look like it's a courtesy he's extending to me.  No, yeah, I gave it to him.  No, you didn't.  He just wanted his mechanic to stand there and wait in case there was a problem.  His mechanic.  Poor Colin.  That must have been some sight, though.  Him pushing a car.  Yeah.  Why would he do anything like that?  I mean, I like Colin a lot, but he doesn't seem like the kind of guy that would be my first pick to help me push a car down the street. 
[00:15:00]  You know?  He probably volunteered in case Jerry has another project.  Maybe he'll need like a crotchety, funny uncle neighbor.  That Colin would be perfect for.  I know, Jerry.  I mean, you know, we've known you for a long time.  Jerry.  I push your car.  And then Channel 11 did the same story just a mere few minutes ago.  Yeah.  Messing up our names.  And more car trouble for Jerry Seinfeld.  Just three days after flipping his Fiat in the Hamptons, his friends reportedly had to help him restart his Porsche in Greenwich Village. 
[00:15:30]  Fellow comedian Colin Quinn went on Opie and Anthony's XM Satellite Radio Show Friday and said he was tired after giving Seinfeld's car a jump.  They can't spit that name out.  No.  We're going to have to change the name of the show.  No.  Exactly.  Opie and Anthony.  People are, there's a couple people saying that they think he went to Canada.  Were you hinting at that on Pal Talk last night when you got home? 
[00:16:00]  Was I?  From the big weekend away?  I don't know.  Did I?  There was a phone call he hung up and there was something on instant feedback as well.  Is it?  I don't know why they're guessing Canada out of nowhere.  I'm assuming you might have given more info last night on Pal Talk.  When the hell did this happen?  Last night?  Was it Canada?  Why would I say anything like that?  Huh?  Why would I say that?  We'll see, Anthony.  The beauty of guessing where you went over the weekend needs some kind of ending. 
[00:16:30]  You know what I mean?  Oh, it'll have an ending.  Really?  Yeah, at some point.  I'm sorry.  I just can't divulge certain information at this point.  But eventually you're going to have an ending how?  Like Charlton Heston?  I hope not.  Damn.  I hear he died.  When the hell did this happen?  Saturday.  Let's go to Aaron in Oklahoma.  See, people kind of like this bit, but we need some kind of payoff. 
[00:17:00]  Closure?  Radio's all about payoffs.  I'm sorry, though.  This isn't just a radio bit.  This is Anthony's life.  No, it's just a radio bit in the end.  So we need a payoff.  All radio bits need a payoff.  I'm from the school that the payoff doesn't have to be right away.  Yeah.  You know, we got a bunch of little things happening out there, little storylines that  people are trying to figure out.  Well, that's why.  This is sort of an interactive thing also, because I know a lot of people are involved,  like I said, on Pal Talk and various message boards.  They're trading information. 
[00:17:30]  There are some security people that are apparently trying to rat me out at airports.  Really?  Yes, yes.  Some security people that may have seen me at certain airports or are claiming to see  me.  And then there was one that said he saw me at an airport.  airport, and the next person that came through, or a couple of people that came through, one  of them had an O&A shirt on.  And he said, I just saw Anthony just walk through this very checkpoint. 
[00:18:00]  And then that guy gets on the message board, copy, paste, copy, paste.  I saw Anthony in the airport.  Blind CC, blind CC.  Is it fair to say that this trip was different than last week's trip?  I don't think I need to say that right now.  Oh, my God.  You just start bragging.  That's what I would be doing.  Bragging?  Just brag.  You're opening everyone's faces.  You're single, and you might be just traveling the world. 
[00:18:30]  Do you know people listen to this program?  How would it seem if I just throw all my cards out there?  Busted Magnums laying.  Right.  These are supposed to fit.  I don't know.  Let's say hi to Aaron in Oklahoma.  Aaron.  It's not bragging when they put out an Amber Alert.  Hi, Jimmy.  I hope your neck gets me feeling better.  Thank you.  It's very sore.  Yeah, well, I just want to give a hint.  I fly a lot as well.  And there are a limited number of president's clubs in the airports where Anthony might have flown to. 
[00:19:00]  Okay.  Last weekend.  Really?  So, Anthony, you're kind of giving yourself up.  Am I?  A limited number of president's clubs?  I've seen one in every airport I've been to.  Which airports have you been to lately, Anthony?  Well, there was.  Oh, boy.  Well, there's one in Cleveland.  There's one in Houston.  LaGuardia.  There's also one in L.A., I think.  All right, listen.  There's actually more than just the hub ones. 
[00:19:30]  You made it too easy today.  First of all, I just want to say that you flew to Detroit.  Why would I?  I like the jungle fever.  Is that it?  Yeah, because you and the mayor share text messaging skills.  You might have blown it, though, because Continental only flies three places from LaGuardia.  Wow.  Aruba.  Mm-hmm.  Houston.  Right.  Cleveland.  Exactly. 
[00:20:00]  That's interesting.  Hmm.  Let me think on that.  Look, you gave out the info.  EROC just helped out a little.  Did I?  Yeah, you said you flew Continental out of LaGuardia.  Oh, I said LaGuardia?  No.  Oh, crap.  All right.  Because I always...  You know, one time I went to Newark, and my flight was out of LaGuardia?  Really?  I was so pissed.  I don't blame you.  I was like, what the hell is this?  Oh, I said...  When the hell did this happen? 
[00:20:30]  I didn't even know.  See, you got to be...  Oh, wow.  I didn't even know.  You got to be vaguer, Mike.  Vag...  Vaguer.  A bit more.  I got to be a vagrant?  You got to be a bit more vague next Monday.  Do you think I didn't know that when I asked if it was a nonstop flight?  Do you think I didn't know that?  Do you think the Continental kid...  I know.  Jimmy knows everything about Continental.  Continental.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey there, Rob. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, I know how this is all going to end.  Anthony's going to end up going to a certain farm in Seattle and not having a good time.  Mr. Hands.  Ow.  Couldn't you hold that beast back?  Find Anthony with horse-tooth prints in his back.  You're just big choppers.  Speaking of that whole thing, you know, they made a whole documentary about that.  My wife was on Netflix and it's called Zoo.  They made a documentary about that guy that died from that horse. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, his name was Kenneth Pinyon, I think.  He was a Boeing engineer in Seattle.  And I didn't like the documentary, but it was informative.  But they didn't name him.  I mean, Tom Likas actually named him, which I respected.  Because, you know, he's not a child.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right, about you now.  By the way, before I figure out on that subject, I met somebody in Portland.  She's a fan of this show.  Big fan of this show.  And she brought a guy with her, a buddy of hers.  His girlfriend apparently worked at that farm.  Really?  This was in Seattle, I'm sorry.  This, of course, is the sex farm where mostly gay guys went, I guess, to have some sex with some animals. 
[00:22:00]  I don't know.  But this girl I talked to, her buddy's ex-girlfriend was the receptionist at the horse farm in Seattle.  The receptionist?  They had a receptionist?  Well, you have to apparently go in and put down what you were looking for and what you wanted.  I would love to get her on the phone.  You got her number?  No, I want to connect her email.  I think I just...  All right.  Very cool.  How many pink socks did she see?  All right.  Do you know how many...  Do you know how many tear-stricken, this wasn't what I was expecting, faces? 
[00:22:30]  I can't believe horses are so aggressive.  Boo-hoo.  You'll ride on the tummy back home.  You have your own car.  You have to have a friend take a cab and drive you back in your own car because you can't sit.  You got to just lay down in the back seat.  Yeah, your tummy.  Ow.  Pink socks.  You have to take a cab to a farm.  I have an injury. 
[00:23:00]  Hey, really, really fast.  The Big A tongue scraping video is up on YouTube.  Just...  Oh, it's so disgusting.  Just pop in Smelling Big A Tongue Scrapings in YouTube.  Smelling Big A Tongue Scrapings.  And you can check out everyone just gagging from Smelling what we scraped off Big A's tongue.  The video is really good.  Sam did a great job.  E-Rock really sells it right off the bat.  He falls down.  Once again, Smelling Big A Tongue Scrapings on YouTube. 
[00:23:30]  We did that yesterday where we had Big A come in here.  He has horrendous breath.  We scraped his tongue for the first time in his life.  And the guy is...  How old is Big A?  Easily in his 30s, right?  He's got to be...  I don't even know.  How old is he?  He's got to be...  He's 30-something.  Easily.  Really?  Has to be.  He put him in his 40s, but...  Oh, really?  In his 40s, even?  I don't know.  And we got what could only be described as, like, whole oysters.  We were able to scrape off his tongue.  And then we put it in a spoon.  And then we had pretty much the whole staff, except for Anthony. 
[00:24:00]  Anthony was the only one.  No.  I couldn't do that.  It should be pointed out that Anthony was the only one.  I could not smell that.  That didn't smell what was in this spoon that we collected for Big A's tongue.  And the video is pretty damn good.  But it's Big A Tongue Scrapings, or smell Big A Tongue Scrapings, on YouTube.  All right?  Check that out as we take a quick break here.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, no.  Kenny's putting on his headphones. 
[00:24:30]  That can't be good.  That just means radio magic is about to happen.  He's going to make an entertaining show disappear.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Kenny, what do you have today?  I think people forgot to buy tickets.  What are you talking about?  You know, your animation festival.  Yes.  You know, it's coming soon, and you got it.  There's like 100 tickets left.  Tickets are on sale now.  Yeah, that's what I say.  Tickets are on sale now. 
[00:25:00]  That's what I say.  Tickets are on sale now.  That's what I say.  Tickets are on sale now.  That's what I say.  When the hell did this happen?  Tickets are on sale now.  Yeah.  So, come on.  There's 100 left.  Yeah, let's be done with this.  Wow.  100 left.  100 tickets left before we can start bragging that we got a sold-out show for the animation  festival, right?  Yeah.  I wanted it to be sold out already, people.  I'll tell you what happens.  People try to buy larger quantities than they can, and they give up.  There's a lot of singles and doubles left. 
[00:25:30]  Oh.  It happens a lot of times in shows.  When you see 1,800 tickets go that fast, and there's 100 left, it's because there's  two on the end here, and someone calls up and goes, can I get six?  And they don't have six.  And they say, we don't have six together.  Yeah, so buy them in like twos and ones, and then just work it out.  It's going to sell out no matter what.  June 5th, Roseland Ballroom, the One Animation Festival.  Tickets are on sale now through Ticketmaster.com.  Right?  Right, Kenny?  Tickets are on sale now.  And thanks for being Debbie Downer this morning.  Kenny picks me up. 
[00:26:00]  I'm literally awake for 15 minutes.  Yeah.  Alarm goes off, water on the face, brush the teeth, bam, I get to see Kenny.  Then I get a, how was your weekend?  I said it was very nice.  Went down to Philly, looking at wedding places and things like that, and no real big stories  there.  And then the next question, the next statement is, you know, the Animation Festival should  have sold out by now.  You guys should have had a sellout on Friday.  Yeah.  Tickets are on sale now. 
[00:26:30]  Well, I blame myself.  I guess I didn't, like, remind people that tickets are on sale now.  You're not a good hype man.  You're no Flavor Flav.  I'll say.  The thing is, if you have a hundred tickets left out of all that, you can pretty much  consider it a sellout.  Kenny's gift.  Those will go.  Is not spinning things.  Yeah.  He's not a good spinner.  No.  This, Kenny is the no spin zone.  Oh my God.  He should be.  He takes any fun spin and just puts a nail through it.  Like, instead of saying, like, hey man, great sales this weekend, hundred shy, you'll be 
[00:27:00]  there by the end of the day, just announce it once.  Yeah.  It's, I don't know what happened.  I don't, I guess things are done.  I think the whole organization is starting to fall apart.  Those cracks are getting bigger.  That's the worst.  Yeah.  So don't make me look bad.  Buy the hundred tickets already.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you, Kenny.  Oh, thank you.  No.  Thank you, Kenny.  No.  G-H.  Tickets are on sale now.  Anthony, thank you.  Jimmy, thank you.  All right. 
[00:27:30]  Thanks, Kenny.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  ONA Animation Festival, June 5th, here in New York City, Roseland Ballroom.  All right.  Listen, on Friday's show, we had a lot more radio to do, and all of a sudden, like, the  whole freaking station started crapping out on us.  Yeah, it was crackling.  We wanted to do The Pregnant Man on Oprah audio, but we also have Rock the Cradle  audio.  What do you want to do here, Ant?  I like that.  You choose.  You choose.  I like the Rock the Cradle because I can't stand the pregnant story. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  I hate it.  Well, we were watching Rock the Cradle last night on MTV, and the host basically  saying it's the greatest show to ever be on MTV or something.  It is the worst show to ever be on MTV.  It's a bunch of rock star kids trying to be rock stars themselves.  The concept actually is really good, but the beauty of this whole thing is they don't  have the talent of their fathers.  No.  No.  Or mothers.  Or mothers.  There's a few mothers in there, right, that have daughters or sons in the competition. 
[00:28:30]  So they come out, and they sing a song.  It's basically American Idol with rock star kids.  Celebrities, yeah, rock stars or singers, children, and they get up there and show that  they do not have the talent.  Right.  The one we want to highlight today is Olivia Newton-John's kid.  Uh-huh.  Her name is Chloe Latanzi.  Of course it is.  And she can't be more than 20, 21 tops.  And she already has plastic surgery. 
[00:29:00]  Really?  Ridiculous plastic surgery.  Like what?  Duck face?  She's got the collagen in her lips big time.  Duck face.  And her face looks really, really tight, like there's a bunch of Botox.  Maybe she's getting the Botox along with her mom.  Like the mom's getting old, so obviously in Hollywood you can't get old in Hollywood,  so you do the Botox.  But it looks like she's bringing her daughter to the doctor's office for some of this Botox  as well.  That's healthy.  And this broad was anorexic.  She's not anorexic anymore, for now anyway. 
[00:29:30]  She'll probably go back to not eating after this horrific showing on the show.  So, this is Olivia Newton-John's kid singing In Excess, A Little Taste.  Don't ask me what you know is true.  Don't have to tell you.  So far, so good, right, Ann?  Oh.  I don't like that whole...  Don't ask myself. 
[00:30:00]  A thousand years  But if I hurt you 
[00:30:30]  And they run  From your tears  And I told you  If we could fly  Cause we all have names  Some of us don't know why  I was standing  You're the head 
[00:31:00]  To all the light  And they could never  Turn us apart  Looks like a tranny  Yeah, that's just a little girl  We got a picture up of Chloe  On our computer screen right now  Look at that  That is some plastic surgery  Right?  I heard better sounds  Coming out of the Yates' kids  Oh, terrible 
[00:31:30]  Sounds just like Olivia  Yeah, what is she?  Like, she didn't sound like  She speaks Ingy  I don't know  No, she speaks English  Yeah?  Yeah, she speaks English  Cause that mother of hers  Is what, Australian?  Yeah  She didn't sound Australian  No  You were standing  You were there  You were there  The world's colliding  I'm trying to remember  Who else was on the show  I saw the signs  What?  Collin's downstairs  Collin's downstairs 
[00:32:00]  Collin's downstairs  Great welcome to the show  Yeah, thank you  Make guests really feel welcome  Nobody's in the show  He's just downstairs  Trying to get up  Yeah  Let me in, stupid  And the Norton  Dinner with the Nortons  And what a treat  Treat that was  Put it in and peck at each other  People are saying  She looks like Marilyn Manson 
[00:32:30]  Getting back to this  Chloe  Oh, yeah  Olivia Newton-John's  Kid there  With the duck lips  She sings like  She's being killed  By Charlie Manson  The show is terrific  To laugh at  Yeah, who else  They got on there?  They got like  MC Hammer's  Really fat kid  Extremely fat  Like, she's an iceberg  Actually  When they were just  Having a close up  Of her singing  Pretty good looking  Black woman  Yeah 
[00:33:00]  And then they fade out  And it's just  Iceberg  Just gets really  Really wide  See, look  Not bad  That's MC Hammer's kid  I know this is radio  Not bad  She looks like  LeVar Burton  Yeah  Really  Don't play me  Belt out a rendition  Ow, that's my foot  And then  D. Schneider's son  Is doing  Rock and roll  By Zeppelin  Yeah  How did that sound?  That's a tough song  To sing 
[00:33:30]  D. Schneider's son  Was doing  Rock and roll  By Zeppelin  Oh, okay  It was alright  How old is he?  I don't know  I mean  Why would you try  To do Zeppelin?  Yeah, that's  D. Schneider's kid  Go to the MTV website  We'll have all these  Pictures up on  Onaradio.com  Do you think  D. was mad?  Like, D. probably  Said, like, hey  You know, maybe  You might want to do  We had some cool songs  And, ah, I'm gonna  Do Zeppelin  Yeah, I'm gonna do  Zeppelin  Oh, you don't want  To do, like, you know  Actually, they did  I wanna rock  He did a little  Profile on all these  Kids and what  D. Schneider's kid 
[00:34:00]  Was saying  A lot of people  Say my dad's  One-hit wonder  Well, I'm here  To say he's  He was a  Two-hit wonder  That's right  And if you  We know D. a little  Bit, a little bit  A little bit  I don't think he's  Happy that his son's  Going on MTV  And saying that  You know, he was  A two-hit wonder  Yeah, he was there  At the beginning of MTV  Heavy rotation  Yeah  Let's say hi  To Michael in Brooklyn  Michael  How's it going  Mike  How are you, Mike?  I can't believe  I finally got on 
[00:34:30]  I've been calling you guys  For, like, years, man  Wow  Awesome  Dude, back when you guys  Were on 102.7  I could never  Freaking get through  To you guys, man  Right on  What do you  Want to talk about today?  Why are you calling us  Today there, Michael?  Uh, basically  I saw that coming  A mile away  But I really enjoyed it  Bye-bye  So, I don't know  I don't know what we  Can do with this  Rock the cradle thing  But it's definitely  Some good  Some good train wreck TV 
[00:35:00]  For everybody out there  Yeah  Absolutely  Gonna have to check that out  Alright, really quick  This story is just  Driving us nuts  Let's just get through it  Pregnant man on Oprah  But it's not really a man  Ugh  No  But it's not really a man  Not a man  What is it?  A transsexual, Jimmy?  A woman who had the operation  Not the operation  She went through the hormones  Yeah  And her breasts  I don't know if her breasts  Were removed  Or if they naturally shrink  And she has a beard  But she kept her  Reproductive organs  And they're calling it him 
[00:35:30]  Because it makes it  A more intriguing story  Right  There's not a pregnant man  No  It's a chick  It's a chick on hormones  That the hormones  Enabled this woman  To grow a bit of a beard  Grow a beard  Have no breasts  Have hair  I know  Chest hair  Kind of crap  Whatever  Give that stuff to E-Rock  The media is  The media  No offense  Oh E-Rock  The media loves this story  For some reason  Of course they do  It's one of those odd stories  That people love 
[00:36:00]  Getting around the water cooler  And talking about  And when this first hit  I was thinking  That it was really a man  I'm like  What the F is this about  And as soon as I realized  It was a chick on hormones  I'm like  Whatever  But Oprah really had fun with this  Really really was interested  In the  The woman that looks like a man  That's pregnant  Story  That's what we'll call it  Yeah  We'll call it  And so  You first started with testosterone  And then you made the decision  To have your breasts removed 
[00:36:30]  Yes  They removed my nipples  And reshaped them  And graft them  Back onto the  Upper portion of my chest  Don't they remove them  Reshape them  And then push them up  Or something  Don't they  Yeah  They basically remove the glands  And pull the skin down  And you know  Put your nipples back on  Then put your nipples back on  Yeah  Okay  Okay  Since we're in the genital area  Let's just keep going  Get it over  Okay  Might as well  Painless procedure really  Now let's get to the penis part 
[00:37:00]  Okay  What would you like to know  Everything  No really  So did you have like  Like implant surgery  Or  I actually opted not to  Do anything  To my reproductive organs  Because I wanted to have  A child one day  So you're a  Breastless woman  That's pretty much  What this is  A breastless woman  A breastless hairy woman  With some facial hair 
[00:37:30]  Having a kid  Yeah  We're talking about  Hey Colin  Colin Quinn has made  What's up Boop  Made the studio here  We're talking about  The pregnant man  But it's not really a man  The man has to be in quotations  Because it's really  It's really a woman  They keep saying man pregnant  Pregnant man  It's a woman  Because it didn't even go through  A sex change  So you can't even  Pull that little card out  It's a woman  That had  A mastectomies  And  Is hairy  Because of hormones  Having a baby  So what 
[00:38:00]  The news keeps saying  Man man man  Exactly  A few  A little testosterone  Does it make you a man  No  They said  You put on like  One of those  Oldie time  Have a woman  Put on an oldie time  Handlebar mustache  And say  Look I'm a guy  What else doesn't make you a man  Holding a gun  What does that mean  Is that a dig at me  No they always say  Holding a gun  Doesn't make you a man  No I wouldn't dig at you  Anthony  I wouldn't dig at you  Because I'm listening 
[00:38:30]  To my radio this morning  And I hear you come on  With this idiot  Blathering away  Trashing me  And here's the best part  We all know  First of all  Yeah you help  Your dumb friend  Anthony in the middle  Everyone trashing me  Goes yeah I mean  I like Colin  But what's he doing  I can't tell you  The level of fury  I felt  Hearing this  This back alley  Tunisian knife fighter  Trashing me  As if I really am  Pushing Jerry's car 
[00:39:00]  For fun and profit  For fun and profit  I was fuming  What did you call him  What did you refer  To Anthony as  The other day  At the cellar  A Corsican pimp  Oh Christ  He should be on  The Marseille waterfront  In like the 1960s  Oh my god  That's crazy  Anthony's the  He's one of the last drops 
[00:39:30]  In the French Connection  Chain  He brings his loading gang out  You can't even take that  As a compliment  That I said  I can't picture you doing that  No that's not what you said  Do we have to play the tape  I mean I like Colin  I like Colin  And he  He shakes his head sagely  What is he doing  Can we get that  Now I need that  Sagely  Sagely  What were you doing  I know  I was listening to the show  This morning  I love the fact 
[00:40:00]  Here's why Bob  Is not only fat  But retarded  Because he actually  Calls me the other day  Or I call him  To try to wake him up  Like my big thing  Is when he's doing  Morning radio  He tries to sleep  In between that  I try to call him  Wake him up  At the morning  He goes  Jared I'll put you on  He puts me on  Nobody even was there  For that story  Except for me  Where I pushed  Jerry's car  Except for one kid  On the stoop  I thought I'd get away  With it  I was like  Thank god  All these camera phones  I walk up the block  There's nobody  One kid sitting on the stoop  By himself  Like a half block  He goes  Nice job  Colin  So I told him 
[00:40:30]  The story  Bob was in  West Palm  He wasn't even there  And he still airs it  Like what about the car  He retarded  Let's get back to  But it's all about  Bob's CD  That's what I'm here about  Pregnant man and Oprah  Let's  Two more quick clips  And then we can move on  From this dumb story  Oprah wants to know  If by taking testosterone  Do you grow testicles  Oprah wants to know this  I thought she's a smart woman  He doesn't grow them  So I was asking the question  She knows nothing about  Male genitals 
[00:41:00]  That's what it is  Exactly  She's never been close  No  She has no idea  If gal don't have it  I don't see it  That's my motto  Your genitals  Do you have like a penis implant  Or you did something else  No  Amazingly  Hormones are an incredible thing  Testosterone  You know  In the womb  Up until I think  Two months  We all look the same  Her genitals look the same  Yeah that's true  Testosterone is introduced  You all know that right  Have you seen the  No  Yeah 
[00:41:30]  You didn't know that  No  Yeah we  Okay  Oprah should try a penis implant  One day  Yeah  Yeah so when testosterone  Is introduced  That's when male  Genitalia starts to form  And reproductive organs  And I just  You know  Meaning  Does it grow testicles  In the womb  I don't mean to be ignorant  But does  Do you like  People are driving up  The southern state right now  Will you take this story  And move along  You gotta start producing  The show apparently  The story's horrifyingly boring 
[00:42:00]  Want to go to the back office  And just produce the show today  Yeah  See what you come up with  For us Colin  It's true  No I mean  I just introduced  Disostrum to my body  A little later  So  Yeah  The body had already  Formed to a certain point  But certain changes  Do happen  She's basically saying  That she grew male stuff  Certain changes do happen  No there's probably  An increase in size  Of certain  Things that a woman has  That are very sensitive 
[00:42:30]  And used during sex  Yeah  Clitoris  Thank you  Thank you  You can't  You can't  That is really psychotic  That's actually sexist  It really is  When did you figure out  That you can't say that word  Was it during my slaloming  Through the whole thing  Trying to work around the word  But I mean  It's one of those technical words  You know what I mean  Yeah I know  Yeah but they don't care about that  They don't understand  The abbreviated version of it  They don't care on this show 
[00:43:00]  Which coincidentally  Looks like you're a sidekick  Norton  Sidekick  Sidekick  That's the point I heard the most  Yeah  Why you thought you were an equal  You're a sidekick  And don't forget it  I guess  I'm below equal  And above lackey  Colin this last clip  I'm certainly above mechanic  Colin  Why don't you bring the tools  Well that's the deal  Then he drives off  And I wave goodbye  Good job Jerry  Oh he didn't even look  In his mirror  Don't miss that green light Jerry 
[00:43:30]  That's when it stalls again  Bye  He's waving  And he's getting like  A puff of like  Exhaust smoke  In the station  Bye Jerry  It's almost as embarrassing  As the other night  When Jerry came in  And Jim goes  Like they're equals now  Hey Jer  And Jerry goes  Hey  And then later I go  You didn't remember his name  He goes  Yes I do  James  He didn't remember that  I saw him the other night  You're not as equal  He doesn't know who you are  I'm not as equal  But he always calls me Norton  That's what he calls me  And today he called you James  He was stuttering  Because he didn't recognize you  Because he didn't see you no more  He didn't know whether to call me Jim 
[00:44:00]  Jimmy  You're majestic irrelevant  Now go on with that Oprah thing please  That's not true  He knew me very well  At least he didn't get gravel to the forehead  As Jerry pulled away  Exactly  I'm glad he doesn't know my name  He'd have me pushing things  Alright this last clip Colin  I know you have ADD  It's only 38 seconds  Can you handle 38 seconds  And then we move on from the story  It's not me  And then we move on  Don't worry about me  I'm worried about the listeners  Does it get larger  It does  Yeah  And it looks like a penis  It looks like a small penis 
[00:44:30]  Yeah  She can say that  But we can't  It's not a matter  Yeah  All the women just start clapping  It certainly does  My husband hasn't rolled off on me  In a long time  And that's what I  I'm trying to say  That her thing  Turns into a small  One of our things  Yeah  And all the women laugh  Like they're angry  With their husbands  Because they're stuck  In Orchard Park, Illinois  Like lonely  And the big night out  Is the Oprah show  Well to some people  Yes  I don't know 
[00:45:00]  You can ask my wife  Okay  So it means that  You're quite a man  Basically  Your  It looks like a small penis  And therefore  You  Look like a man  Yes  And I can have intercourse  With my wife  Intercourse  Okay  Shut up  You cannot  With my wife  Shut up  I'm all man  I have to say  You cannot  Yeah that's ridiculous  Shut up  Ovary  Abdomen  I know  I know  This is not the time  I give her all  Eight millimeters  Nothing on that 
[00:45:30]  Go ahead Kyle  I was just going to say  I know this is not the time  And this is the last thing  You guys need to hear  And I know this is  You guys on the line  And me just  Spuriously throwing this  In there  And you guys  Have to deal with the weight  But the fact that  You have to be on radio  And bleep  Something said on Oprah  I'll rip apart  Whoever runs these stations  Yeah it is ridiculous  You have to rip apart  Something that's on  Four o'clock in the afternoon  On Oprah  Yeah  There's something  Very  That really makes me crazy  You're right  You're absolutely right 
[00:46:00]  There's no sense to it  About that kind of stuff  But it just  It makes no sense  Because she's helping  She's  It's  You know  She's got that person  In there for education  And we're here for humor  She does help  In a certain way  Anthony  Where was Anthony  This weekend  Did you ever establish that  I say Winnipeg  There's a lot of  Tordry behavior  Because he changed planes  In Detroit  Right  We don't know  He says he went non-stop  But it's a dumb bit  Because he doesn't give us  Any info  And there's no ending 
[00:46:30]  I get plenty of info  And it isn't a bit  There's no ending  It's called my life  It's not a bit  It's his life  And you're right  No it's a bit  Well his life is a bit  And his life is a bit  At this point  Oh all the world's a stage  I understand  I don't look at it  As his life  I look at it  As good radio  Everything's just a bit  He's not giving us  Good radio with this thing  Because there's no ending  Well there is an ending  And the ending  Is not this week  Look I haven't spread this out  As long as you did  Your goddamn Spuds Buckley  The ending  I'll tell you exactly  What the ending is  People love Spuds Buckley 
[00:47:00]  Yeah give us a little  No  Jesus  Five weeks  Him with his relatives  The Lebanese  Arms and Diamond Traders  Of West Africa  That's where it ends  It ends in a horrible  Civil uprising  But see  This is where  This is where  It's not fair  We guess  And I think  One of us  Might have guessed  Where he was  And he doesn't even  Say if we're right  Or wrong  Is there a way  To hook him out  To something  I don't believe  That it was a non-stop  I don't believe  It was a non-stop  I think he laid over 
[00:47:30]  And flew back  Because if I knew  Certain things  Were a quick jump  From here  He knew it  And he flies enough  I believe it was  None of non-stop  Really  That's great  Well we're not really  The best part  I mean I could be wrong  The best dramatic part  Of the story  Is not the flight pattern  You bore  No it does  I want to know  Where he went  And what he did there  Thank you  I believe  Actually  No wait a minute  Let me look  Go on American Airlines  And I want to  I understand  He flew stupid  As I point  We go to Erie  Pennsylvania  I think he's a real  Puddle jumper 
[00:48:00]  No he got out  And pushed the plane  Down the middle  Hey you want to hear  What Anthony said  About you  Before you were here  Alright we found the club  This is what Anthony  Was saying about Colin  Before he was here  Watch the patronizing  Pity in his hope  Alright  Poor Colin  That must have been  Some sight though  Him pushing a car  Yeah  Why would he do  Anything like that  I mean  I like Colin a lot  But he didn't  Seem like the kind  Of guy  That would be  My first pick 
[00:48:30]  To help me  Push a car  Down the street  You know  He probably volunteered  In case Jerry  Has another project  Maybe he'll need  Like a crotchety  Funny uncle neighbor  And we're back live  That's what they said  About you  When you weren't here  There Colin  I know  I heard that  Actually  Yeah  I was listening  To the show  And I was so mad  Where's all that  Phony came in  The troubled  Sleepless artist  I had a fight  With my girlfriend  So I just wandered  I have a pinch  Nick  Shut up  I know I was  With you last night  I'm sore  Did you try those 
[00:49:00]  Exercises  You know what  I just did them  Against the wall  And you know what  He looked silly  What were they  Fighting about  Do you know  Or maybe you don't  Want to blow up  Well we all  I don't know  Everything was fine  At dinner  It started after  And then I guess  They left  They're like a  Lifetime abuse couple  Where out in public  They look fine  And everything  But inside  I think Jimmy's  Getting there  With phone books  Getting there  With phone books  And maybe they were  Fighting over the fact  That she probably  Noticed that Jim's  Expensive caddy  Looks like a caddy  Camry

[00:50:00]  You went non-stop  After you got there  After I got there  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  There was a layover  But you're also  Going non-stop  Right  Did I tell you  That I was  By the way  I was just  Speaking of that  Kind of humor  I was driving  Upstate in Connecticut  Like way upstate  By myself  And I heard  Scorch on some  Obscure local radio  Show  Yeah you're  Obsessed with Scorch  Oh Scorch  Is up there  Kingdom of Nakedness  Yeah this is DJ  I was obsessed  Over the fact  That you used to  Have him on the show  And you'd sit there  And go what else  And you guys would be  Laughing like it was 
[00:50:30]  The best radio  And he believes it  Sorry but  You're going to  Pull him first spot  Do show dressing  Do show dressing  Sam get Scorch  On the phone today  Because Colin's here  We haven't talked  To Scorch in a while  He's a DJ  Scorch  Where is he  In Syracuse still  New Hampshire  Where is he  You can't keep track  Of this guy  And he does this show  Called The Kingdom of Nakedness  Yeah  Totally nude radio  The Naked Militia  What he changed his name  Yeah he doesn't do  The naked thing anymore  He does PFG now  What's that  Pretty effing great  Yeah PFG 
[00:51:00]  With Scorch  He's in Manchester  New Hampshire  And he does  PFG TV podcast  Every day  Wait he's not even  On the radio anymore  No no no  He does  Afternoons in Manchester  Could you get us  A highlight from his podcast  Because one morning  We were watching  The Scorch podcast  In the office  They're pretty damn funny  And I loved you in fame  Okay  Get us a clip of Scorch  Doing his podcast  Okay  Oh yeah Bruno  My son  My son's music  Sam what does he  What does he talk about  On his podcast 
[00:51:30]  Well he talks about  Whatever you know  He's thinking about  In the day  I think I was just  Looking over some stuff  And he has like  A lot of celebrities  Are turning 50  So some things you can do  When you're celebrating  Your 50th birthday  You want to listen to that  That can be good  I'll listen to anything  He's got to say  Alright  You can see if it's  The same stuff you did  Alright come up  With some good Scorch blog  Push celebrities cars  Down the street  Is that one of them  Oh  Oh  Alright  Colin Quinn's here  Are you promoting anything  No  It's good that  You're out of your house 
[00:52:00]  We're happy that  You're out of your house  Well you invited me  Down this weekend  I can tell you really  Opie wanted me  I did too  But then when I heard  You guys this morning  That just propelled me  Out of bed like Frankenstein  It's obvious  I live pretty close  To the station too  Yeah  I stormed down  Oh they're calling you  Colin Jumper Cables Quinn  On Pal Talk  Steve from Bayshore  It's Opie and Anthony  Boy we have an exciting show today  It's Opie and Anthony  In studio  Colin Quinn  He heard Anthony and Jimmy 
[00:52:30]  Kind of taking  Some light shots at you  A few light blows to the head  Right  And they got you out of bed  And then you said  Screw this  I'm coming in to defend myself  My eyes snapped open  That's right  You're obsessed with  Trying to figure out  Where Anthony went this weekend  It's our new bid on Mondays  Because he's flying  All over the place  Doing God knows what  Or maybe he's flying  In one place  We really don't know  No  According to Jimmy  The important part of the story  Is that there might be  A transfer flight  Few people could have heard  The crushing board 
[00:53:00]  That is Jim Norton  Before going  I think you know  If you really look at  Some of the patterns  Of Delta  They have a couple of  There's an hour flights  There's a very good possibility  Of a layover  When figuring out  Where somebody went  You have to figure out  How long it took him  To get there  And we know where  Airport he left from  So was there a layover  A delay  You have to know  How long  Were you just going to guess  Everywhere in the world  He went somewhere  What just happened to you  You turned into  A horrible character  It's like a modern day  Peter Lorre  It's scary 
[00:53:30]  He's just like  It's really  No but I'm  I'm trying to figure out  Where he was  I'll tell you where he was  Somewhere outside of Cleveland  Remember there  Was that Nazi prison guard  John Jim Jim  Jim Juk  Jim Juk  Jim Juk  He probably went to  One of those  Alright  There you go there  He went to one of those  Suburban houses  Where Eastern Europeans  Have memorabilia  And he probably  Got a couple of  Shrunken heads  Like Jeffrey Dahmer's house  Yeah  Jeffrey Dahmer's from  Out that way  Were you close to  Jeffrey Dahmer's house  Could have been  He was in  Milwaukee 
[00:54:00]  You're not going to Milwaukee  He only lived in one house  His whole life  I think he's taking  Flying lessons  He does like to fly  I really do  He has some flight  Simulators  I really do  When you were pushing  Jerry's car  Did the thought  Mention  The thought come into your head  That you might drop dead  Of a heart attack  As you're pushing  Jerry Seinfeld's  Really nice Porsche  The other thing I don't like  Is suddenly  I'm the poster boy  For being out of shape 
[00:54:30]  I swear to god  I wish I could curse  But it's true  I'll keep to the rules  You did lose a little weight  You lost a few LB's  I'm on my way down  Although Norton pointed out  I was so happy  I put this new  Sweater jacket  And Norton was calling me  Dwight  From this boy's life  It's so awful  The one he wears right now  Is black and red check  It's like a table  Like a picnic table  Tablecloth  It's horrendous  With a hood  With a hood though  You really think  She's outdoorsy  And rustic looking  Usually if someone  Slob dead  Like to smack your face  Idiot 
[00:55:00]  Were a lot of people  Wearing this jacket  Where you are  No  Not that one  That's a good question  Colin  Maybe he was in the  Yeah  Some of the  Minnesota woods  Hunting  Humong  Someone on  SNFeeback  Thinks he might be  A drug mule  A drug mule  On the weekend  I'm too afraid  To go to jail  Yeah  And he's too delicate  You know  Yeah  His brother  Believe me  His brother was like  The rocker  I told you  His brother was like  A bike  He used to beat up  My cousin  Poor Timmy  Yeah  Out there 
[00:55:30]  Beautiful  Shirley  Wherever that was  I don't even know  The two families  The Quinns  And the Kumias  We would fight  We don't like you guys  There's no room  In Ron Cock  I'm up for the two of us  My brother beat up  Colin's cousin  Really  Yeah  No he did it regularly  He was a psychopath  Anthony was a sensitive child  That didn't do drugs  Right  His brother down there  He smelled pot  Wafting into his room  My brother's constantly  Smoking pot  Anthony's with his  Dungeons and Dragons 
[00:56:00]  Set and his pots  On the room  I had microscopes  And things like that  And a telescope  And you know  His heart broke  His brother's heart  I was like  You want me to give  This kid the experience  Well he won't  Or anything  No  And he just  Throw the compass  Over his head  My brother's  Just tossing  He's like Rocky Denison  My brother's  Tossing bimbos  Out the window  Because my mother  Was getting home  And smoking pot  And I'm just there  With my microscope  Trying to smear  Something on a slide  So I could see a cell 
[00:56:30]  I should have just  Taken samples  Off Joe's mattress  I was just such  A geeky kid  My brother's doing drugs  My brother was like  The first kid busted  For smoking pot  In Elwood Junior High  Ever  Ever  And it became like  This big thing  That when I finally  Went to Elwood Junior High  The teachers  Took me aside  And were like  We want to make sure  You know  We know about your brother  And everything 
[00:57:00]  And we just want  Want to know  If you're going to be like that  And we really want you  Not to follow in his footsteps  I'm like okay  Give me a couple of years  I won't  He had those big glasses  He had those big glasses  Yeah  Well Opie in high school  Opie smoked some pop  But he was also a wrestler  So you know what I mean  He was into sports  And stuff  He was like a wrestling team  I was part of three groups  I was part of the burnouts  Part of the jocks  You could not have been  Part of the burnouts  With the way you looked  I was on the outskirts  Of like three or four different groups  I was firmly entrenched 
[00:57:30]  In the burnouts  I was a part of one  Open was like 12  He was like the Little League master  He had like a 680 batting average  680  He was like a real  He was so good in those days  That when he finally just quit early  It was still people  I was really good at sports  Growing up  But I was scared  To step into the batter's box  And hit a fastball  Even though a fastball  Was what  24 miles per hour  At that age  Just stop brushing your back  You just go like  Oh boy  I'm going to get hit with this thing  I was too scared  So actually Colin  I sucked at Little League  Thanks for bringing it up 
[00:58:00]  I was my field guy  Were you a wrestler?  I was a runner  I played a little lacrosse  Basketball was my big sport  Duke lacrosse?  Really?  Yeah  I really thought I was going to be  In the NBA  You got skills  I got skills  I got mad skills  Memphis or Kansas?  Honestly I didn't follow it this year  Who are you taking?

Why would he bleach his hair  To make it look like  He's completely grey  He looks like  Richard Kuklinski  The Iceman  Scorch drinking bleach  You got me annoyed with you now  Why?  I don't know  Dahmer also lived in Beth, Ohio  Which is about 30 minutes from Cleveland  Really?  Did he? 
[00:59:30]  Where else did he live?  Ridiculous  I didn't know that  Alright well  For you Colin  Because you're obsessed with Scorch  Why are you obsessed with Scorch?  Because he does bad radio  And he doesn't know it?  When I first came on this show  You guys made me laugh so hard  That you were doing bits  Where you would just let the guy talk  And you just  It just made me laugh  The idea of like  There was never an acknowledgement  That this was horrendous  What were some of his bits there young Sam?  When you guys brought them  To the MTV Music Awards  At the height of its hipness 
[01:00:00]  Yeah yeah  As your dates  That's still one of the funniest things ever  Thank you sir  Well I mean  He did Doucher Dressing  That was a classic  Doucher Dressing  Wheelie  You know  Everything was just like  Almost like a parody  Of a radio  Yeah  Wheel of Meat  It was my all time favorite  Wheel of Meat  You spin it  And it lands on something  And then you have to  Slap the meat  Against the console  And then the callers  Have to call up  And guess which meat it is  How does he think up this stuff?  He's a genius  Oh he is 
[01:00:30]  He's a man  Ahead of his time  Right Colin?  What other bits there is Sam?  When he was leaving Syracuse  At the end of his run  He became obsessed  With top ten lists  And he would just like  Make up reasons to use them  So he found this  Top ten gyms list  On the internet  And it's just the top ten  I think Jim Belushi  Was on there  Top ten people named Jim  So he told his sidekick  That the next day  Was the anniversary  Of the jungle gym  So he was gonna do 
[01:01:00]  Top ten gyms  And his sidekick  Started coming up  With all these ideas  Like why don't we send  Somebody to like a jungle gym  And make them do weird stuff  Or whatever  He's like no no  We're gonna do this  Jungle gym list  He made up the anniversary  Of the jungle gym  Oh he made up the anniversary  Just so he could do  The top ten gyms  No because he just wanted  To do his top ten gyms  Oh how awful  That sounds like a scandal  Waiting to explode  Yeah  He fortunately made up  The anniversary of the jungle gym  Well here you go  Hey  Here's him doing his blog  Bleach beard  Hey what is going on

[01:06:30]  Totally nude radio  What bothers me  About Bobby Kelly  Not to belabor the point  But  Is that  If he was on Scorch  You'd have to tell him  The show stinks  So he wouldn't know  He'd do it for like a month  Dude yeah I'm on Scorch  Today dude  He wouldn't know  Dude you know what  He's not O&A  But you know what dude  He's entertaining people  What is he  Supposed to be  Shmarmy  Shouldn't he be  Shmarmy like these  Other guys dude  You know what  Your god damn

[01:08:30]  Was you have  To get a listener  To call in  And for instance  Guess the meat  Like Paul  He would consistently  Come up with ideas  Like any kind of stunt  To do with the stunt guy  There  And Scorch would  Always turn it down  In favor of something  More like top ten gyms  So you could call in  With your favorite  Person named Jim  Or wheel of meat  But that keeps people  Involved  Wheel of meat  Yeah  You can do  Wheel of meat today  Yeah and then  Wheel of meat's the greatest  That sounds  Wheel of meat  Only Scorch  He could show  So he throws meat  You try to guess  It's a pork chop 
[01:09:00]  Yeah  We had the  The brain cell stimulator  Would come on  At I think  6.45 every morning  And it would be  A trivia question  Brain cell stimulator  Yeah  And we had three phone lines  In the studio  So off the air  This is just a joke  Between us guys  When all three phone lines  Would light up  Scorch every time  Would go  Ooh  Oogie oogie  Or  Lookie lookie miss cookie  That's what keeps you  Going crazy in a job  When you got a little  Inside jokes to laugh 
[01:09:30]  Except it only  Maybe once a week  We got all three lines  Let up  Three lines  So it's rare  But lookie lookie miss cookie  Yeah  He's probably put him  In a good mood too  Like yeah  You know  He just loves his life though  Who can fault him  He has no clue  He is having a blast  Being scorched  Right now  He's not sitting there  With a pinched nerve  No  No  Fighting with his girl  I know  But I came in  He's probably in a happy relationship  And his neck is quite fine  All the vertebrae are 
[01:10:00]  Maybe in a perfect position  Well actually  The pinched nerve  Could be from fighting  With your girlfriend  Yeah  A little too much stress  Maybe you're holding in  Some toxic anger  No it was only  A very brief fight  It wasn't long  We're not done  Analyzing it yet  But you're incorrect already  So I'm not going to make  Your ass out of yourself  I'll tell you  Jim swept that check  Last time  It was pretty expensive  We went to Red Hot Grill  Oh  Wow  He picked it up  And hesitated  It was pretty expensive  Jimmy's good like that  That probably pinched his nerve too  I have  That's not the point  It's true  Times are tough  So I'm going to take you out 
[01:10:30]  Okay Ralph  It's true  I put a lot of books in here  While these guys were on hiatus  I put a lot of money in your pocket  I never denied that  We got Scorch listeners checking in  We got to go  Paul in New Hampshire  Paul what's up  Hey what's up boys  Hey  Scorch is unlistenable  What  He still does the brain cell simulator  And all he does  Is basically ask questions  In order for people to call in  And do a show for him  I don't listen to him  But when I drive for work 
[01:11:00]  Up here in New Hampshire  So when the afternoon junks  At BCN are out of range  I have to listen to  Some of the local stations  Right on man  Alright thank you  He's probably just jealous  Because he didn't have  One of the top ten gyms  Let's go to Jeff  In New Hampshire  Jeff  Hey good morning guys  How you doing  New Hampshire is a hotbed  Of Opie and Anthony  Activity this morning  What's up Jeff  I thought you guys  Like Scorch  This is  We love Scorch  This is what we do  To the people we love  When are you guys  Going to figure this out  I mean Colin's  Thinking of beating today 
[01:11:30]  That's because we love the guy  Scorch knows we love the guy  He's just hysterical  To talk about his show  I mean  Jesus Christ  We worked with the guy  Yeah  Hung out with him  But we know  He comes up with these ideas  That are a little off the wall  Yeah  Do the ideas PMF  PFG  PFG  Let's go to Joe  The guy is funny  He's just a little too crazy  Sometimes  Yeah  That's what we're trying to say  Yeah he goes  He doesn't know when to stop  I mean the 50 year old  Birthday party  It was like crazy  That's crazy 
[01:12:00]  Slow down a little  But it's true  People like to hear about celebrities  That's actually a good tie  Let's go to Joe in New Hampshire  Joe  Hey what's up guys  Hey  First of all  I take offense  To you calling me a Scorch listener  But  Alright what's up  Well the last guy was ready to fight  Yeah  For the last couple years  Since he's been up here  Every time he said  You know  My boy Scorch  I wondered if he ever heard  The guy's voice  He sounds like he's doing  A drunk calling impression  Hey  Hey  Be nice 
[01:12:30]  One more  Then we'll move on  Corey New Hampshire  What's up  Hey how's it going  Yeah I work construction up here  And we listen to 101  They won't change the station  So every day  Every time Scorch comes on  I walk over  And shut that cancer  Word retard off the radio  Even during Wheel of Meat  How can you turn off  How can you turn off  Wheel of Meat  I'll have you know  I talk to Scorch sometimes still  And he's emailed me  And told me  He has the most successful show  In Manchester New Hampshire 
[01:13:00]  He's told me that  In all of Manchester  Yes  All of Manchester  Scorch is still on fire  Maybe  Alright we gotta take a quick break  Colin Quinn in studio  Hey I just want to turn  Some people on to  Well I'm gonna tell Colin  We're gonna talk through you  On Friday's show Colin  We brought Big A in  You've seen Big A right  I know of course  We shaved his eyebrows  And on Friday  We brought him in  He has really bad breath  We scraped his tongue  For the first time  We don't know how  You can't just glaze over it  By saying he has really bad breath  It's so horrifically bad 
[01:13:30]  That if he's in a room  No matter the size of the room  Long enough  The entire room  Will fill up  With the odor  Of his mouth  It happened  He's kind of right  I was trying to be nice  I was trying to be nice  But he's kind of right  He's kind of right Colin  I'll describe his breath  Stephen King wrote a book about it  Well there's a few titles  You could pick from  So we 
[01:14:00]  We don't know how old he is  He's easily in his late 30s  I'm guessing  And thinks he might be in his 40s  I don't know  We scraped his tongue  For the first time  He's never done this in his life  And what could only be described  As like oyster looking  It looked like oyster  And cottage cheese  Mixed together  It was coming off his tongue  Did you hand the scrapings  Over to the FBI  Well  We put it on a spoon  We put it on a spoon  And we made  Pretty much the entire staff  Except for Anthony  Smell it 
[01:14:30]  Right  And it was not  I'm looking at Iraq  I'm looking right now  I'm looking at him  Iraq went down  Like he was punched in the face  Iraq went down  It completely floored Iraq  And then we went around  The entire staff did it  And the montage video  Is up on YouTube  Just go to  Smell Big A  Tongue scrapings  And you'll find the video  It's horrific  Colin  I like Big A's outfit though  He's kind of rocking  A Hollywood producer  He's got like  Three days unshaven

[01:17:00]  Anyway come to that  At the Street Theatre  And the Lakeshore Theatre  In Chicago  I hope to see you all there  Thanks a lot  Walking in LA  Walking in LA  Nobody walks in LA  Walking in LA  Radio Shock Jock  Opie and Anthony  Colin Quinn in studio  Entertaining everybody today 
[01:17:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show  He just gave Jimmy a 10-15 minutes  Man to man background  Man to man  Norton's suffering from a pinched nerve  He hasn't slept  And he just looks miserable  He looks tired and miserable  We got Dr. Kaku waiting to come on the show  We're going to have him on in a few minutes  He's got a new book out called  Is it his first book?  I don't even know  No he's had other books  Jimmy's obsessed with Dr. Kaku  Best-selling author of Hyperspace 
[01:18:00]  Ah  It was also one of his books  Hyperspace  Well the new book is  Physics of the Impossible  I like how he puts theories  These scientific theories  Behind some of the science fiction  We've had in the past  And on TV shows and stuff  And kind of puts it in perspective  You know  Like time travel, hyperspace  Things like that  Yes  Not to belabor the old image of Anthony  But can you just see him 
[01:18:30]  Stuffing his nose in Ray Bradbury  To start to shut out the drunken brawl  Between his family members  I don't want to feel pain  I don't want to feel pain  I want to be in the time travel field  I want to be able to go back in time  Psychological time travel  I want to go back in time  So I can help my family  I'm self-practicing the hitching and swings  Apparently  I hate physics  Hate  Yeah I know  I understand that  I just want to yell out that I hate physics 
[01:19:00]  But why  Jimmy is very interested in Dr. Kaku and his theories  And it should be some very good radio  You can't not be interested  I just don't want to feel like I'm back in high school  Like having that  Feeling like my brain is short-circuiting  I'm trying to figure out this physics crap  How do you think Dr. Kaku would feel if he knows Jimmy's fascinating  And he only took one semester at Essex Community College  Don't try to  You're trying to play catch up on your idiocy now  Please don't try it  You're like 
[01:19:30]  Kind of naturally smart  But you're not well-bred  And you're not educated  I happen to have a better grasp  On theoretical physics  Than you think  Doesn't Colin make you feel dumb  Yeah  No not at all  Because I know what I am  My limitations  I'm a creep and a kind of a half dummy  Who thinks he's smart  Right about now  Dr. Kaku's thinking  Where am I  What am I doing here  I think he'll enjoy this  Yeah we'll have some fun  Do you think he noticed the look of fear in Jim's eyes  When Jim asked him some idiotic question  He turned him and he was afraid of being exposed 
[01:20:00]  He's like  It's like when Voss acted with Chaz  I still missed that one  Oh god  Bing  You heard it though right  I heard about it  Oh we'll have to  Go get that for Colin  It is so  Thank you  Horrifically bad  I mean you cannot get worse acting than Voss and Chaz Palminteri  Voss's shame spiral acting technique  We're trying to do way too many things today  But I think we should Google bomb Big A tongue scrapings today 
[01:20:30]  Alright  Big A tongue scraping should be Google bombed today  We want to make that the number one search in America  Big A tongue scrapings  Let's Google bomb the hell out of that  Okay really fast for Colin  Yes  We surprised Rich Voss  Yeah  Rich was taught about his acting and auditioning  And Jimmy's like  Which is a shameful  Yeah  Right and Jimmy's like  Well let's see how you would do  Like you know how bad are you  And so Jimmy like set up this thing where Voss would come in and read lines with Jim Norton  At the last minute Norton leaves his microphone 
[01:21:00]  And the door opens up and Chaz Palminteri walks in  And they're reading lines from A Bronx Tale  Which is Chaz's play  But the beauty of this Voss had no clue  We completely surprised him  And what you're about to hear is something we put together called A Bronxish Tale  And when Voss thought it was me reading with him  He was nervous and in the bathroom practicing his lines  He really wanted to make an impression  Oh he certainly did  Yeah  And uh  Listen to this no emotion  Yeah  Just just uh  Horrible 
[01:21:30]  Horrible acting job  People could see his uh  He's right now  Voss is dressed in like  The Florida compulsive gambler  Like ne'er-do-well Jewish son  Ne'er-do-well  The other one's a doctor  And you know  Manhasset  And this one's down with his mother  In Boca  And she's like  You got one of those calendars  Don't you  A big word per day  What the hell was the big word  Manhasset  No ne'er-do-well  Ne'er-do-well  You're using a lot of big words  I think you got one of those 
[01:22:00]  Like big words  Of a day calendar  You know I  Act like I  This is how it is  That was Colin's apostrophe word  Once in a while he likes a big word  And that one has an apostrophe in it  I like it  Yeah  Big words with apostrophe  I don't like you guys trying to act like  I'm secretly planning to be brilliant  It's just the way I am  Here we go  Here's a bronchish tale  Put together by Steve and Derek  Robert De Niro  It's not what you say  It's what he sees  In his directorial debut  We can't accept that  I'm a little ready  Chaz Pimentary 
[01:22:30]  I don't give it to you  I give me a son  And Rich Voss  Louie  Fiends  I want my money  A bronch  Fiends  You can't dodge me forever  Come on  What are you doing about  What are you yelling about  John  I got a problem with this guy over here  Louie Fiends  This guy owes me 20  And it's been two weeks now  And every time he sees me  He keeps dying to me  John  Should I crack him one or what  The struggle  Of an idiotic Jewish comedian  Stammering his way  Through a few lines  Of film dialogue  With a genuine Hollywood actor 
[01:23:00]  Listen see  Sometimes violence is not the answer  Is he a good friend of yours or not  Nah John  I don't even like him  Well there's your answer right there  Look at it this way  It costs you 20 dollars  To get rid of him  He's never gonna ask you  For money again  He's never gonna bother you again  He's out of your life  For 20 dollars  Come on  He got up cheap  Nah you're right John  You're always right  A Bronx  Tale  How do you know the right ass  All the time Johnny  Well I try to keep my eyes  And ears open  All the time  And I read  You read  Yeah I read  Come on  Come on 
[01:23:30]  Let's go to Mario's  Next door  And get something  Is he horrendous  Louis Bing  It just takes all the joy out of it  It's not even like bad  It's just like oh  That's just it  It's not only just bad  It's so bad  It's so bad  Like when you see the movie now  You're gonna be like  Eh why don't you  I used to love this movie  Yeah  I know  And then to hear  Chaz commentary  You know to hear him do his lines 
[01:24:00]  And it's just brilliant  And then Voss  Yeah it's just guy  Louis Bing  It's just  It's just flat  It's devoid of emotion  Yeah  It's like listening to a two dimensional being speak  He's like a cardboard cutout  With like a voice  Just coming out of the mouth  The mouth doesn't move  Just the lips have a hole cut in them  And sound is coming out  And look at that piece  That's what he looks like  Hey we got Dr. Kaku standing by 
[01:24:30]  But we gotta get to the big story of the day  Obviously  We gotta do a little bit on this  Right to the tape here  Maybe not  Hold on  Yeah  What the hell  What happened  Try it again  Most people knew Charlton Heston  As the actor who played God's right hand man  Behold his mighty hands  Known for his strong screen presence  And his chiseled good looks  Heston was a natural as the handsome hero  Yeah the passing of Chuck Heston 
[01:25:00]  Chuck Heston  He's dead  When the hell did this happen?  84 I think  Alzheimer's got the best of him huh?  Yeah he's another one that just kind of ducked out  He gave a little wave  Toodaloo people  I'm off to Looneyville  We'll see him no more  We'll see him no more  And then they did the same thing with Reagan  They all make their announcement  And then you never hear from them again  They have this final  Like really nice speech 
[01:25:30]  That's put together for them I guess  I don't know  Or maybe they could sit there and think it out  Very eloquent speech that they give  When they give  You know Reagan was  And now I must bow out  And well  Have the rest of my life  Sitting here with my brain  Shrinking into the size of a raisin  And then they leave  And you never see him again  And then you just hear they died  But you know in between  The speech and the dying  Was just  Horrific  Catastrophe 
[01:26:00]  It was like  It was like one long voice in Bronx Tale  Louis Beans  Damn you  Damn you Louis Beans  Twenty dollars  I need my twenty dollars  They're dodging me lord  Why lord have you forsaken me  And let Louis Beans dodge me  Wait a minute  And it's his bit  About his daughter  He's dodging her  Dodging me  Yes  Yes he's ripping me off 
[01:26:30]  Hoo hoo  Damn you lord  Why did you forsake me  With the disease that turned my brain  Into a walnut  Why  They cut out my brain  You damn dirty ape  In a hole the size  Of a little pin  They could extract  What was left of my brain  Whoa  They did a final CAT scan  It was all skull  With a little P in the middle  Just a little P 
[01:27:00]  That knew how to shoot a gun  That was all that was left  Was guns  I would just fire weapons  Around the house all the time  Frightening Mrs. Heston  Was there a Mrs. Heston  Am I survived by  Thank you Dan  Yes  Frightening Mrs. Heston  I forgot I have Alzheimer's  How would you know  That old bitch  She had a head like a Mardi Gras float  Oh wait I can't use the same jokes  Damn me  I used all my Alzheimer's jokes 
[01:27:30]  With Ronald Reagan  Me and Ronald Reagan  Play golf in heaven now  Yeah  Yes  We play one hole  Eighteen times  But it's all different to us  That old gag lord  That old gag  Is it true you're not hitting  A golf ball around  You're just hitting your brain  Around up there  Yes  We just hit  My brain  Is that a title list  No  It's my  Medulla oblongata  I have a calendar  With big words like 
[01:28:00]  Colin  Damn Colin  I had the brain  The size of a pinhead  And I wouldn't push  Seinfeld's car  What's wrong with you  You're a celebrity  Damn you lord  You've forsaken me  Yes  Left me to rot  In my own feces  I was such a big  Hollywood star  I banged them all too 
[01:28:30]  Yeah you did  All of them  I was a man's man  And in the end  It just hung there  Like a wet noodle  Never to be used  Like my brain  I guess  God needed  A gun advocate  That's what happened  That's why he took me  God loves guns  Yes he does  I brought God  An AR-15  He loves it  He shoots it at Jesus  But he doesn't mind 
[01:29:00]  Jesus holds his hands up  And it's target practice  God hits the hose  Every time  What  Too much  Yeah  I got that  Nate in Brooklyn  For you Mr. Heston  Nate what's up  Hey guys  Good morning  Good morning  Yeah I guess  Now that old Chuck  Is gone  We're going to be able  To pry his gun  From his cold dead fingers  No  From my cold dead  Oh  Oh  Oh I see  You're empty handed  They got my gun  You have nothing  In your hands sir  Damn 
[01:29:30]  From my cold refrigerator  I'm thirsty  Need something to drink  1959  That distinction  And the movie Ben Hur  Won him the Oscar  Who are you  A rarity  In Hollywood  His film career  Endured more than  Half a century  Damn  From technicolor epics  To science fiction  That granite carved profile  Intimidated opponents  With a glare  Or few choice words  Take your stinking paws off me  You damn dirty ape 
[01:30:00]  That's when I was uptown  Okay  I have Alzheimer's  I have an excuse  Shut up  I say things  That I probably shouldn't say  A cabbie grabbed me  And I told him that  Damn you  Oh I remember doing  Planet of the Apes  With Cornelius  And lovely Zira  I had jungle fever  With Zira  I remember that 
[01:30:30]  Oh  She  She never shaved  Down there  Although it would look odd  If she did  Wouldn't it  Just everything else  All ape hairy  And then just  Walk that  What about Nova  Nova  Nova  Nova  She was dumb as a rock  But boy what a great lay  Pity I couldn't remember her  In my final years  She would have been good  In my spank bubble 
[01:31:00]  My spank bubble  Was really whittled down  By Alzheimer's  It was pretty much  Who was left in there  Mickey Rooney  Not much pleasure  Not much pleasure out of  The spank bubble  Being full of Mickey Rooney  And who is that other guy  Yeah  See  That guy  Edward G. Robinson  Edward G. Robinson  Thank you Colin  You share a birthday with him  Don't you  See that's an old joke  Damn you Colin 
[01:31:30]  He was the longest serving president  Of the screen  I was the president  Damn why didn't I do something  Conservative politics  And fought the forces  Of gun control  After four people were killed  In a school shooting  Heston took command  Of the declining  National Rifle Association  And turned it around  With what became  A polarizing phrase  From my cold dead hands  I cast this rifle 
[01:32:00]  Upon the Nile  Oh wait  No it was a staff  Damn you  I hate being in these old movies  If I had a gun  In the Ten Commandments  I'd have kicked ass  Even that stupid  Planet of the Apes gun  I had  I could just  Mow them all down  You've made an idol  Of gold  And then I just  Gak gak gak gak  That's right  Damn  Damn you  All the hell  I have a gun 
[01:32:30]  That's what I wanted to do  Rewrites on everything  What year is it  25 B.C.  How about I fire  Some rounds off  I love my guns  I hope I get guns  In heaven  Won't that be fun  I can just shoot at people  Go right through them  It couldn't hurt anyone  From my cold pool  It's very cold  I didn't have the heater on  I have Alzheimer's  Give it up for me  Please  Damn you 
[01:33:00]  Boy I changed  Didn't I really spin around  Yeah you did  I supported Martin Luther King  What the  Did I have Alzheimer's first  And then I lost it  And got it again  What am I crazy  Damn me  In 2002 
[01:33:30]  The man who had lived  His whole life  In front of the public  Told America  About his private battle  He was diagnosed  With Alzheimer's  I'm neither giving up  Nor giving in  I believe I'm still  The fighter that  Dr. King and JFK  And Ronald Reagan knew  But it's a fight  I must someday  Call a draw  More than a draw  I think it won  Yeah  And then finally 
[01:34:00]  In 2003  Heston was given  The Medal of Freedom  America's highest  Civilian honor  Charlton Heston himself  Has become one of the  Great names in film history  Yes sir  Charlton Heston has left  His mark on our country  As an artist  And as a citizen  He left a mark  In his diaper  Actor or activist  Heston loved the power  He had with the crowd  Thank you for everything  Not only now  Tonight  But on  Through all the years  Oh boy  It's been a wonderful run  I'm gonna miss you 
[01:34:30]  Oh boy  No you won't  I was gonna miss you  But I don't remember you  Damn God  After all the holy movies  I've done  Oh damn you  I spoke with the burning bush  Last night  Yes my wife  Mrs. Heston  Had a rash  I was speaking with it  Mrs. Heston  Damn you  Was that rash like  Twano?  It was awful 
[01:35:00]  The burning bush  It turned my hair white  Oh  Oh  Why would you forsake me?  They cut out my brain  Oh  Yes  I certainly wish  I did have a gun  When Michael Moore  Interviewed me  Alright look  I had Alzheimer's  At the time  That fat son of a bitch  Took advantage of me 
[01:35:30]  Damn him  I hope he has the same  The same consequence  I had  An early death  Wait how old was I?  84  Oh Christ  84  I'll take that contract  No kidding  That's not bad  Are you gonna be  Can I talk to Anthony  For a second?  Yes  Are you gonna go for  The presidency of the NRA  Or what?  I am going for the  Presidency of the  National Rifle Association  That's if I have time  Cause I'll be flying  To Cleveland 
[01:36:00]  I have Alzheimer's  I don't know where I'm going  It was Cleveland  It was Cleveland  No I have Alzheimer's  It was Cleveland  Anthony was in Cleveland  This week  I have Alzheimer's  It might have been Cleveland  It might have been Canada  It could have been Florida  No  Or it could have been Japan  All the little chicks  With their pink  I don't know where I was  Where was I?  I have to look at my airline ticket  Pan Am?  They've been out of business  For years  How do I remember that? 
[01:36:30]  I have Alzheimer's  Damn me  The great  Chuck Heston  Chuck Heston  Dead  84 years  Dead  84  I'm sure I'll be  Popping into the show  Every so often  I hope  Now that I'm dead  I hope you do  Chuck and Heston  From the grave  Warning  Warning  We gotta take a break  We gotta  Cold grave  Oh

[01:39:00]  And you roll it  I'm into string theory  I was into it  All through my  Battle with Alzheimer's  Yes  I play cats in the cradle  Make a string  And put it on my hands  And Mrs. Heston  Would play with me  Hold on  That was  My string theory  I have Alzheimer's  I have old timers  Don't laugh at me  Damn you  I know you weren't  That's exactly the problem

[01:42:30]  I'm very happy  Is here  Yeah  You ride with him  In an elevator  Shut up  Oh boy  I give him  The creeps too  Maybe because  You are 112  On the best  Seller list  Oh  That wasn't even  Nice  Well if I'd  Gotten a celebrity  To write the forward  Maybe I would have  Done  A forward written  By Colin Quinn  Oh that had to hurt  Oh  Yeah that didn't  Help sales  I mean now he's  Just saying  Yeah you're right  I suck  Opie and Anthony  Lots going on  Stay there  Moving right along 
[01:43:00]  It's the Opie and  Anthony show  Colin Quinn in  Studio  And now we welcome  Dr. Kaku  To the Opie and  Anthony show  I want to start  By asking you  How well you did  On your SATs  In high school  Well I got 800  In the SATs  And in high school  Actually I built  An Atmos Smasher  That's what got me  Into Harvard  I assembled  500 pounds  Of transformer steel  22 miles  Of copper wire  I blew out  Every single  Circuit breaker  In my mom's house 
[01:43:30]  Every time  The lights went on  My mom would  Shake her head  And say  Why couldn't I  Have a son  Who plays baseball  Maybe if I  Give him a basketball  And why can't  He find a nice  Japanese girl  I mean what's  Wrong with my son  He built his  Atom Smasher  In the garage  An Atom Smasher  Yeah well it got me  Into Harvard  So I can't complain  I guess not  But how do you  How do you do that  How do you just  Build an Atom Smasher  In high school  Yeah when I was a kid  I used to devour  All the stuff  You know Flash Gordon 
[01:44:00]  I used to watch  All the Flash Gordon series  But I realized  Very early in life  I didn't have blonde hair  I didn't have muscles  And I was not going  To get the girl  Like in Flash Gordon  But Dr. Zarkov  I mean he fascinated me  I mean he was the man  Who built starships  He was the man  Who built ray guns  And cities in the sky  And I said to myself  That's for me  Yeah wow  See Anthony  If your dad didn't  Get in the way  You could have been  Dr. Zarkov  I know I was so  I was so into science  You had very similar  Upbringings but Anthony's 
[01:44:30]  Father didn't want him  Doing any of this stuff  I see  He smashed his microscope  And everything as a kid  I see  The fork in the road  Yeah it was that  Fork in the road thing  And it was girls  And maybe some marijuana  No contest  And then yeah  Science  And my love of science  And boy  That was an easy crossroads  I took the evil road  Well you know  So many people  Are interested in science  Look at the movies  Right  All the Hollywood blockbusters  I mean if you like  Star Wars and Star Trek 
[01:45:00]  You're going to love  Physics of the Impossible  Because I'm a Trekkie myself  And this book addresses  All the things  That you see in  Back to the Future  And the Terminator series  And the Time Machine  So people like  Looking at that also  They like seeing things  That were made  A few years back  And seeing how  Our advancements  Kind of tie into  Shows like Star Trek  Where they're walking around  With you know  A tricorder  And a communicator  And here we have  Cell phones and PDAs  That are you know  Similar to what they 
[01:45:30]  Had in the TV show  That's right  When you watch Star Trek  I mean it's like  Watching something  From the 50s  Because we have  All that stuff now  Yeah  We have everything  Except transporters  And warp drive  And we're working  On those by the way  We have cell phones  Already  And the transporter  We can already  Teleport atoms now  This is made big news  In the physics community  Shock waves  We can teleport atoms  One day we will  Teleport Captain Kirk  There's a catch though  There's always a catch 
[01:46:00]  Yeah what's the catch  The catch is  You have to die  Going through the transporter  You have to die  You have to die  And you know  Your body is reconstituted  You know  Someplace else  With the same memory  The same neural circuits  The same genes  And that Captain Kirk  Over there says  I'm Captain Kirk  But you just saw  Captain Kirk die  And so then  Where did your soul go?  I mean  So is it  Is it making a copy?  It's making a copy  Like The Prestige  Like the movie  The Prestige  Oh yeah  They were making copies 
[01:46:30]  Of people yeah  Oh you saw the movie  Jumper right?  Yeah the movie Jumper  Actually some physicists  Helped to consult  On that movie Jumper  Really?  Where you disappear  And you reappear  Someplace else  Except in real teleportation  You have to die  To do it  It's one of the drawbacks  Of the program  Boy that is  That would definitely  Be an asterisk  It would keep it  You got there fast  But  Yeah death is  Definitely a downer  But there you are  Someplace else  Same memory  Same personality quirks  Same everything  I mean who is the real you 
[01:47:00]  If you just died  And there you are  Someplace else  Alright so what exactly  Is like  The Hubble telescope  Was built to see  The beginning of time  That's right  It's gotten relatively close  But like there's something  In the way  And it can't see  The actual  They want to see  Like the explosion  The beginning of it all  Well we have  Baby pictures  Of the Big Bang now  The explosion itself  We photographed it  Go to the website  NASA.gov  Type WMAP  That's the name  Of the satellite  And we have  Baby pictures  Of the explosion  It really looks  Like an explosion  It's in a microwave region 
[01:47:30]  We can't see  The instant  However  Of the explosion itself  However that  The next generation  Of space satellites  Should be able  To give us  The instant  Of creation itself  And that's  Going to be great  We're going to see  The universe  Come out of the womb  And maybe  Maybe  An umbilical cord  Connecting our  Infant universe  To a parent universe  A parallel universe  It's so  It's so hard  To wrap your mind  Around  What was there  Before  The Big Bang  Because  You know 
[01:48:00]  There had to be  Something  Yeah  Well we think  We know what  Happened before  The beginning  The new picture  Is a bubble bath  Next time  You take a bubble bath  Each bubble  Represents a baby universe  We live on the skin  Of the bubble  Just like flies  Chapped on fly paper  We can't escape  But there are  Other universes  Out there  And this is called  The multiverse idea  You're freaking me out  Now  And believe it or not  In one of these universes  Elvis Presley  Could still be alive  I mean  Blows the mind  Right  Is he healthier 
[01:48:30]  Or is he still  Shaped like Colin  See how that hurts  Colin  When they start poking fun  In the middle of  A physics discussion  Yeah  In a parallel universe  Oh no Jim  I don't think  You really wanted  To get me into this  Because I wrote down  A few of your lines  You said to the doctor  Before you got on the air  Yeah they were having  A little small chat  Before we got back  With the show  And Tom was  Jim if you could have  Seen folks  Observe it  The phoniness  Yeah  Norton leaning in  The doctor with a  Bill willy look  On his face  Going what  I guess this guy  Is like a fan  Norton starts  Trying to talk  Here's what he said 
[01:49:00]  Your book's doing well  Though for a science book  To be in the top  Because you're a competition  No what I was saying  Was  No that's a direct quote  No you missed  For a science book  To be in the top  Because you're a competition  You took me out of context  That makes me sound  Like a fool  I was saying  Is that the book  Is now number 12  On the bestseller  I know  Which is amazing  Because you're competing  With a lot of  Non-science books  And for a scientific book  Right  That guys like you  But you kind of  The way you were saying 
[01:49:30]  The tone  Non-science books  That guys like us  Wouldn't sully our hands  With doctor  I mean  Non-science books  Why do you say  Like your idiotic book  Admit to him  That's who he's competing against  There's just a lot of people  A lot of people out there  Have watched The Terminator  They've watched  Back to the Future  And they wonder  What happens  If you go backwards in time  Right  Eat your teenage mother  Before you're born  And she falls in love with you  Right  Well you're in deep doo-doo  If that happens  Well yeah  But a lot of people  Wonder about these things  And that's why  That's why the book  Is up there  On the bestseller list  It's not 
[01:50:00]  Now you  You believe that  Time travel is possible  That's right  No Stephen Hawking  My friend  Used to say  It is not possible  Ten years ago  He gave up  He said  It is possible  Not practical  We can't build a machine  Anytime soon  But hey  There's no law of physics  Preventing us  From creating a wormhole  Mentioned earlier  Such that like Alice  Going through the looking glass  That's a wormhole  Going back  And seeing your parents  Before you're born  Isn't there  That  See the whole paradox thing  When that comes into play 
[01:50:30]  Just ruins the whole time travel thing  Going into the past  If you meet yourself  You would have had a recollection  Of doing so  Before you travel through time  It's even worse than this  Think of  For example  A woman time travel scientist  Who builds a time machine  Eventually  She wants to become a man  So she changes her sex to a man  Goes backwards in time  Meets herself  Makes love to herself  Has a baby 
[01:51:00]  That baby's mother and father  Is herself  The same person  Can you imagine  Being your own mother and father  I mean it boggles the imagination  But this is what we physicists  Have to deal with  If time travel is possible  You could be your own mother  Father  Son and daughter  Figure that one out  And then  That is a little odd  Would it be possible  This guy smokes pot  To go back  And kill yourself  But if you did that  You wouldn't be able  To grow to the point  Where you can then  Time travel 
[01:51:30]  So you wouldn't be able  To have killed yourself  See it's just too many  Really odd  Things that could happen  Ah  But you missed something  You see  Einstein says  That time is a river  And we measure it  With our GPS system  Every day  You cannot use GPS  Without assuming that  Time is a river  But  The river of time  Can have whirlpools  Whirlpools in the river of time  And then  You can even have  Forks in the river of time  Now if that's true  When the river of time  Forks into two rivers 
[01:52:00]  And you went back  And killed yourself  Before you  Killed your parents  Before you were born  You kill somebody else's  Parents before you were born  You then are in a parallel universe  I like that  So it's like  Future Biff  Having the big  Casino hotel  That's right  And they had to go back  All the way  And fix it from the beginning  They couldn't fix it  With Future Biff  Because it was  A different fork  Hey  We have a physicist here  Yeah  No we have a moron  That's watched  Back to the future  18,000 times 
[01:52:30]  Hey who's texting you  Are you texting abroad  As you do the big interview  With us today  I just would hope  That it's like  The biggest dummy  Right  On there  Just hey  I got a question for you  I'm lost  It's probably Stephen Hawking  Don't mention my name  To these idiots  Alright so now  I understand the river of time thing  But a lot of people  Probably don't  Why are you pointing at Colin  As you say that Jimmy  I'm not just gesturing  I'm just gesturing  In general  I was wondering  If you could more carefully  Explain what the river of time means  Because I don't want to seem  Like I'm ignorant  But for the listeners  No like you said  What he said 
[01:53:00]  More carefully explain  More carefully explain  Think of it this way  Newton  Newton thought that time  Was like an arrow  Time never goes backwards  Never goes  Always goes forward  And a second on the earth  Is a second on Mars  However Einstein  Comes along and says  Not so fast  Time is a river  Which meanders  Its way around the universe  Time beats faster  On the moon  Than it does on the earth  Time beats slower  For the GPS system  Than on the earth  And the Pentagon 
[01:53:30]  Cannot fight wars  With the GPS system  Unless  You put in the fact  That time slows down  In outer space  But a river  Doesn't go backwards  Ah  But that's the new wrinkle  If you have enough energy  We now believe  That the river of time  Can go backwards  On itself  This is causing  All the excitement  This is called  Closed time-like loops  Go to the physics literature  Type in closed time-like loops  Doctor with all due respect  What excitement?  Among the people  Who are working on  About a hundred of us  There are about a hundred of us  On the planet earth 
[01:54:00]  Out of six billion people  Who understand Einstein's equations  And work with this  Play with this  And we do study  Back to the future  We do study  These paradoxes  Can I say how happy I am  By the way  That when you said  Aha  But the river doesn't  Go backwards  He was so ready  Every blithering idiot  He's talked to  Has said that  And he had an answer for it  I'm the only one  That actually thought  To ask that question  Stupid  And you just had to  Like this  Because I assume  Shut up  I assume the river  Would go backwards  I don't need to ask  He was happy  To have a debate  A spirited debate  With a peer 
[01:54:30]  Called me a physicist  By the way  Because I watch  Back to the future  Do you guys really  Sit around and watch  A lot of these shows  And movies  That's right we do  Because we have to  Tease apart the paradoxes  Given a paradox  We have to figure  Our way out of that paradox  Or else the theory  Doesn't make any sense  You can't use the paper  If there's a paradox  In your work  So we have to look  At the question  What happens if you  Kill your parents  Before you're born  This is something  This is something  That we have to address  They would make  Pretty much at that moment  A fork would be made  That's right 
[01:55:00]  Where you would still exist  But in a different  Time stream  Yeah time stream  You've hopped time streams  Right  If you go back  And save Abraham Lincoln  You've saved  Somebody else's  Abraham Lincoln  From being assassinated  At the Ford Theater  Your Abraham Lincoln  Died 150 years ago  I'm going to do it  A little earlier  So if you go backwards  In time  And meet Hitler's mother  You can prevent  World War II  From taking place  In that universe  But it's not 
[01:55:30]  Your universe  The parallel universe  Has opened up  So you could screw up  Other people's universes  That's right  But they don't know  You're screwing it up  Like somebody  Theoretically could have  Screwed up our whole timeline  But we wouldn't know it  Because it's just history to us  That's right  It's just the way things went  Yeah you know  The TV series Sliders  When they slide between  The very first episode  Of Sliders  There's a boy reading  A book  That starts the whole series  That's my book  Hyperspace  Hyperspace spawned  A TV series  Called Sliders  Where you slide 
[01:56:00]  Between parallel universe  And monkey with  Other people's past  And to them  They don't notice  Because it's just  Their past  That's right  You got it  Somebody could have  Screwed with my past  Hey he's got it  Yeah see  I'm a smart guy  Just as important  When you  Going back to  The Big Bang Theory  At what stage  Of human development  Did this kind of  Tedpole look  As he points  At Jim Norton  Of course he does  I don't even think  He needed to explain  Everyone knew  Where he pointed  He couldn't have 
[01:56:30]  Pointed anywhere else  He certainly wasn't  Going to point at himself  I always had  I always had  Adam smash  And a smash  Your face  In right now  This just goes  To prove  There's no  I don't have  A fat smasher  This just goes  To prove  That there's no  Intelligent life  On the earth  Yes  See  Doctor I always  Hit that actually  Does it suck  To live among  I'm a fellow guest  That appear  In the physical world  Does it suck  To live among  Dummies  Dr. Kaku  Like you can't  Just walk around  And discuss  This stuff  With anybody  Seriously  Hey you know 
[01:57:00]  I have to be able  To address  People's concerns  Because look  I was a kid too  I mean I watched  Flash Gordon  Star Trek  And Star Wars  As a kid  I wonder  These are the exact  Same questions  I asked myself  When I was a kid  Now I can answer  These things  Because you know  Now I can work  Completing Einstein's  Unfinished manuscripts  Right  We can now go  Beyond Einstein  So I can answer  The questions  That I would have  Liked to have answered  If I was a kid  What type of technology  Would we need  To time travel  There's been so many  Different versions 
[01:57:30]  Of a time machine  But as far as  You're concerned  What type of  Actual machinery  Would be needed  Okay you'd need  The energy of a star  I mean a DeLorean  Can't do it  You're not going to  Be able to get  Into a DeLorean  And meet your parents  Before you're born  We're talking about  Bending time into nuts  Which means  A power of a black hole  A power of a star  You would have to be  What is called  A type 3 civilization  A galactic civilization  Now we are a type  Zero civilization  Oh boy  We're not even  On the radar screen  We gotta level up 
[01:58:00]  Jesus  A type 1 civilization  Would be planetary  Like Buck Rogers  Or Flash Gordon  A type 2 civilization  Would be stellar  Like the Federation  Of Planets  But you would have  To be type 3  Galactic  To have the power  To bend time  Into a pretzel  And so however  One day  If somebody knocks  On your door  And claims to be  Your great great great  Great great great  Granddaughter  Don't slam the door  You just don't know  You just don't know  Maybe your descendant  Invite her in and give her a ruby  Maybe your descendant 
[01:58:30]  Wants to go backwards  In time to meet  Her illustrious ancestor  I don't know why  Wouldn't a black hole  They're pretty devastating things  I mean  You know  Just crushing anything  Even stars  Into the size of  A walnut  That's the old picture  We see these black holes  In outer space  A few thousand of them  And they're spinning  They're spinning very rapidly  And we think they don't  Collapse to a point  They collapse to a ring  And if you fall through  The ring of the center 
[01:59:00]  Of a black hole  It's like going through  The looking glass of Alice  Alice's looking glass  Is the ring  At the center  Of a black hole  Where gravity is finite  That's the loophole  That Einstein missed  Einstein thought  That a black hole  Collapses to a dot  In which case  You die  Yeah  You just accelerate  Into the middle of it  And squish  But now we see  These things in outer space  They're all spinning rapidly  We photographed them  A few thousand of them  And they collapse  To a ring  We think  Falling through the ring 
[01:59:30]  Is falling through  The looking glass  You're trashing Einstein though  Well he didn't go far enough  He didn't have computers  Didn't have a comb either  Hey Dr. Kaku  Is there other civilizations  Out there  That's all I want to know  Yeah we think so  And then the question is  How come they don't  Talk to us  And meet us right  Right  Well if you go down  A country road  And see an anthill  Do you go down  To the ants  And say  I bring you trinkets  I bring you beads  I give you nuclear energy  That's some perspective  On things right there  So give me to your ant queen 
[02:00:00]  Or do you simply  Step on a few of them  Oh  We're here to be stepped on  Now you know  Why they don't visit us  So you have no doubt  There's other civilizations  Out there  Oh yeah yeah  They're out there  Definitely  And do you think  The aliens come and  Visit us at all  Or check us out  Or they could care less  Well they're probably  On the moon  If you saw the movie  2001  The most likely  Visitation site  Is the moon  They would land  And leave a robot probe  Basically a machine  That would wait for us  To become type 1  Where we become interesting 
[02:00:30]  And 2001  We thought we would be  A type 1 planetary civilization  With moon ships  Another hundred years  We'll do that  So on our moon  Is the most likely site  For a previous visitation  Of an alien civilization  And we're too stupid  To even know that  Because we're not even  On the moon yet  So yeah  So I think  Previous visitations  Are definitely possible  We physicists think  The moon is the most likely site  Of a previous  Ancient visitation  By a passing  Type 3  Galactic civilization 
[02:01:00]  Very interesting  Listen we've got to  Take a break  We're really late  We're going to continue  With Dr. Kaku  The book is called  Physics of the Impossible  What's the book about again  For the people out there  The title isn't  Doing it justice really  Well it's about  Everyone who's wondered  About phasers  And force fuels  And ray guns  And invisibility  And teleportation  Which we physicists  Say is impossible today  But possible  In the near future  Very good  We're going to go  To the phones next  It's Opie and Anthony  You're checking out  The Opie and Anthony show  We've got Dr. Kaku 
[02:01:30]  In studio  Physics of the Impossible  Is the name of your book sir  I've got a question  Really fast  When I was a kid  And I started thinking  About the universe  And learning about the universe  It scared the crap out of me  To the point  I couldn't sleep at night  Just how vast  And large it was  Does the universe scare you?  No it doesn't scare me  Because we now realize  That when we look  In out of space  We don't see much intelligence  Intelligence is very rare  The very fact that we have  Intelligence on the earth  Means it's precious  Your brain 
[02:02:00]  Believe it or not  Sitting on your shoulders  Is the most complex object  Known to science  Out to 24 trillion miles  Out to the nearest star  So the fact that we have life  We have intelligent life  Is incredible  Because we don't see much  Out there  Right  And for that  That means that  It's very precious  And so instead of  Being depressed about it  I feel very optimistic  And enthralled  That here we are  The only intelligence  Out to 24 trillion miles  Of the earth  It's that whole thing of  We can't really comprehend 
[02:02:30]  Infinity  That creeps everybody out  Because you can't wrap  Your mind around  Something that's never ending  Yeah  Douglas Adams  The humorist  The science fiction writer  Once had a machine  That is guaranteed  To drive any sane man  Totally insane  It's a box  You look at a picture  The picture is a picture  Of the entire universe  With an arrow  Saying  You are here  Guaranteed to drive  Any sane person  Totally insane  The universe is very big  But like I said  Intelligence is very rare 
[02:03:00]  We see no evidence  Believe me  You should see our listeners  I think we got one  We see no evidence  Of intelligent life  In our solar system  And you have to go  To the nearest star  Alpha Centauri  Before there's a possibility  Of intelligent life  What about  How many  Was that like  Four point something  Light years  That's right  Four light years  Look at that Jimmy  What about  You got a gig there  Yeah  What about God sir  How far is that  Door to door Jimmy  Well we have  Charlton Heston here  Oh damn 
[02:03:30]  Inside track  No  Einstein thought  There were two types  Of God  First is the God  Of prayer and intervention  The God that parts the waters  The God that walks on water  He didn't necessarily believe  In the God of intervention  He believed in a different  Kind of God  He believed in the God  Of Spinoza  The God of Leibniz  The God of harmony  Beauty  Elegance  Simplicity  The law giver  That's the God  That Einstein believed in  That the universe is too gorgeous  Too beautiful  To have been 
[02:04:00]  A random chaotic event  So there had to be laws  There had to be simplicity  And beauty  And that's what guides  Theoretical physicists  What guides us  Is beauty and simplicity  In our equations  But who created God then?  Well we think that  There is a multiverse  Of universes  That our universe  Was born  Perhaps buddying off  A parent universe  Like soap bubbles  Budding off other soap bubbles  And we think  That's eternal  This is called  Eternal Inflation  And one of my friends  That may actually win 
[02:04:30]  The Nobel Prize  For coming up  With this picture  It fits all the data  From the satellites  Eternal Inflation  Universes budding off  And sprouting  From other universes  All the time  You've got a friend  That's going to win  The Nobel Peace Prize  And we've got a friend  That has a CD  Coming out tomorrow  So we're very  Bobby Kelly  You deal with planets  And our friend  Has small comedians  Orbiting around him  We're in different  Places sir  I have a question  To something  They talk about  The dark matter 
[02:05:00]  In the universe  That's right  We really don't know  What makes up  What is it  80% of the universe  We have no idea  What it is  That's right  Dark energy  Makes up 73%  Dark matter  Makes up 23%  And atoms  Only make up 4%  Of the universe  And we hope  To produce dark matter  In Geneva  Switzerland  In two months  You probably saw  The headlines  Of the New York Times  The admin smasher  Meet up the earth  Or on a placemat  For Opie  New York Times  Which one is that  Is that the big paper 
[02:05:30]  That weighs a lot  Anyway  The admin smasher  We're debuting  In two months  It's not going to  Eat up the earth  Contrary to  A popular myth  We're not going to  Destroy the planet  We're not going to  Create a black hole  That's going to  Eat up the earth  In Geneva  But how do you know  For sure  People get very worried  About that  You guys are taking  A bit of a chance  I'm thinking  I know  Because these  You guys are bored  These are microscopic  Subatomic black holes  You couldn't even  Light up a light bulb  With these things  And so there's no danger  But we hope to produce 
[02:06:00]  Dark matter  With the admin smasher  You know  Starting this summer  So it's energy  Is it like a physical thing  Like a ball you can hold  Or is it just an energy  It's invisible  Invisible energy  And it's predicted  By string theory  String theory predicts  Dark matter  And string theory  Is what I do for a living  It's my day job  And string theory  We hope will allow us  To quote  Read the mind of God  This we think  Is the ultimate theory  Wow  The final theory  The theory of everything  That eluded Einstein  For the last 30 years 
[02:06:30]  Of his life  And we think  We have it  You know  One of you guys  Are going to just  Do an oopsie  And destroy the earth  You know that right  Oops  There's going to be  Some kind of oopsie  And we're all done  The big difference  Between the doctor  And the rest of us  If I had your  Brain power at that age  Instead of an atom smash  I would have found a way  To like look through  Girls clothes  Yeah  Exactly  X-ray specs  Yes  On the back of the magazine  Right  Hey  You've been in an elevator  With Jimmy  You know that  And he's been talking  About you for years 
[02:07:00]  On this program  And all he wants  Is some kind of  Recognition  The next time you see him  That's all he's asking for  Just a hello  Just a little hello  A little nod  The next time  He asks you a question  Remember the inside  Of his brain  Looks like that picture  What picture  Is Sean  Two ultimate fighters  Just kicking each other  In the face  Anthony and I  Had a debate one time  About gravity  Gravity  Which I was wrong about  It's everywhere  But no  About what made  Like if a planet  Has to spin  I thought a planet  Had to spin  And I said it was mass  Of course  Things that have more mass  Have more gravity 
[02:07:30]  And Jimmy wouldn't  Listen to me  He thought it was  The spinning motion  That made gravity  I'm like no  That no  Well you were right  Of course I was  And I asked him  Dr. Kaka on an elevator  And I asked him about that  And the look he gave me  You would think  I would just say  Hey can I have a hug  I know we don't know each other  But he did explain it  And it turns out  Hey let's go to the phones  We got Kevin in Jersey  Kevin what's up  We're talking to  He probably would have liked  To have seen gravity in action  By you plummeting  In the elevator  We're talking to Dr. Kaka  His book's called  Physics of the Impossible 
[02:08:00]  Go ahead Kevin  Yeah I was just wondering  Yeah I was just wondering  If the good doctor  Could comment on  Some of the physics theories  Related to Lost  You ever watch Lost?  No but I understand  That they have a time travel episode  Right?  Yeah yeah  There's some kind of  Vortexing goes backwards in time  Well like I said  You know we think that  It is possible  To go backwards in time  The catch is  You have to be  A very advanced civilization  To do that  Capable of manipulating stars  Manipulating black holes  So you got to take your starship 
[02:08:30]  And whip it around the sun  And then you got to  Slow down real quick  And then you got to  Bring some whales back with you  Like in Star Trek 4  Of course  They always used that one  As a cop out  When they had to go back in time  It's like why not just  Solve every problem that way Kirk  Yeah  It's like oh we got to fight  Nah let's just swing around the sun  And we'll get these Klingons  When they're kids  Yeah or Superman 1  At the end of the movie  Right  So he goes around the earth  And Lois Lane comes back  Yeah  That was really depressing  Bringing back Lois Lane  Yeah believe me  I'm sure it was him too 
[02:09:00]  I thought they finally got rid  Of that character  When she died in Superman  Oh no no  Superman has to bring her back  She was terrible  That's what happened  To Margot Kidder  She wound up naked  Crawling behind bushes  A few years later  What a psycho she was  What a lois  Yeah but you  More like Blade Runner  Yeah well anyway  You cannot go backwards in time  By whipping around the sun  You can't do that  No huh  But a wormhole  A wormhole is conceivable  I mean all the equations work  Everything seems to work  With wormholes  But not  Winging around the sun  And breaking the light  Now is it because of  The acceleration 
[02:09:30]  Is it  You can't go faster than light  That's the problem  That seems to be  The rule of thumb there  Why though  Why  Well we don't know  But you know  The Admin Smasher  We're debuting in two months  Outside Geneva Switzerland  The particles there  Go at 99.9999999%  The speed of light  But they can't make it  They can't break  The light barrier  That's an iron law  From Einstein  And he's right  Every single time  In fact the fact  That we have hydrogen bombs  The fact that we have  The sun bursting in energy 
[02:10:00]  Is a consequence  Of the fact  You cannot go faster  Than the speed of light  Can you break into  Can you use lasers  And break into like  An underground vault  And steal like millions of dollars  God damn  In principle  Yeah  You can build a laser  Of course you're going to be  In Geneva  They get all those big  Underground banks  That can really do some damage  Over there  Another way to do  Is with invisibility  Invisibility is the way  To rob a bank  Right  That's why  When I was little  So I could sneak  In girls' lockers  Go ahead  Yes  Oh that too  But we're closing in  On invisibility really fast 
[02:10:30]  Proof of principle  Was demonstrated two years ago  At Duke University  We can make objects  Invisible in the future  Now is this by bending light  That's right  You wrap light  Around an object  That reforms like  A river going around  A boulder  And an object  Becomes invisible  So I write about it  In my book  Physics of the Impossible  That the proof of principle  Was demonstrated  And of course  The Pentagon is funding it  It's almost like  The Philadelphia experiment  That they say never happened  The Pentagon is not stupid 
[02:11:00]  They know the advantages  Of an invisible soldier  And they're pouring  Big bucks now  Into invisibility research  You could go up  Behind the enemy  And poke him in the back  And go ha ha  That's right  Ha ha  And the bank robbing thing  Would never work though  Because you'd be invisible  But they'd just see  The bags of money  Floating out  So they'd know  Where you are  Good point  Aha  Flaw  But watching people  Nude would work  Now that's a hell  Of a power source 
[02:11:30]  To bend light  Yeah well  Doesn't seem very portable  Well with a new substance  Called metamaterials  Light bends all by itself  This has shocked everybody  Really  I used to teach  In my physics course  That invisibility  Is impossible  Light cannot wrap around  An object  And reform at the other end  Well I was wrong  And every single  Physics textbook  On the planet Earth  Is wrong  Light in fact  Can bend around an object  Like water around a boulder  Reform at the other end  Effortlessly  Without energy  And make an object invisible  Can you do that for us now? 
[02:12:00]  You know I've always had that question  That's boggled me for a bit  If you're in a room  With mirrored walls  And you  Light up a laser  And then shut it off  Why doesn't  The laser  Much like a bullet  Just continue  To bounce off  Of the mirrors  And ricochet  Once the power source  Is cut off  What happens  To the beam  That has already  Left the laser source  The reason is  Every time it hits  A mirror 
[02:12:30]  You lose about  Point one percent  Point five percent  Of the energy  So after a hundred  Reflections  You've lost  A considerable amount  Of power  But in essence then  There is a small moment  Where when you do  Shut the power  That beam is  That's right  Bouncing  It's just happening  So quickly  It's dissipating  So quickly  That you can't  Can't see it  Right  But yeah  You're absolutely right  You know you have  Two mirrors  Back to back  You see an infinite  Sequence of yourself  As likely  Back and forth  And that's how  Anthony solved  The mystery of the timers  At the Comac motor log 
[02:13:00]  The mirror room  Of course  Yeah the answer  It wasn't a laser  Firing off either  I tell you my friend  Wait wait  And how big was the object  You made invisible  How big was the object  That you made light  The object that was invisible  Is about two inches  It was made invisible  Under microwave radiation  Like which you have  In your oven  However  Visible light  Was now shown  To bend in the same way  Just a few months ago  At Caltech  And also in Germany  So this is rocking  The world of physics 
[02:13:30]  We can now conceive  Of Harry Potter's  Invisibility cloak  Which we once thought  Violated the laws  Of physics  But proof of principle  Has been demonstrated now  Wow  You're like  Every question  You want to ask  For science  That you think of  You're just like  Okay what about this  I know it's like  Hey  Did you guys  Crack homophobic jokes  When Lance Bass  Went up in that rocket  Behind his back  Collegist  Hey I like it though  What's the coolest trick 
[02:14:00]  You could do  The coolest trick  Jim magician  Yeah  He's one of the greatest  Minds in the world  He must have some  Neat bar tricks  Well we like to  Read people's minds  The magic tricks  For telepathy  We understand  However we think  That real telepathy  Is also possible  Not just the tricks  That we sometimes  Amaze our friends with  At Brown University  They took a stroke victim  Who was paralyzed  Put a chip  In this paralyzed  Person's brain 
[02:14:30]  Connected the chip  To a laptop  And in three hours  Bob Kelly  In three hours  The guy is playing  Video games  Reading email  He's totally paralyzed  And doing lines  With Chaz Palmetari  You can send email  And in the future  Really  This is with stroke victims  In the future  Even normal people  Will have a chip  In their brain  Sure  And you'll surf the web  By thinking about it  Just by thinking  You'll be able to access  The entire internet  And this is coming  Proof of principle  Was demonstrated  Two years ago 
[02:15:00]  At Brown University  Direct interface  Now between the brain  And a machine  First time in history  Not the quacks  That are out there  But real  Real interface  Between a human being  And a laptop  It's always been  A goal I guess  To take that  Little bit of energy  That the brain  Transmits out there  And kind of harness it  And I know  I'd always try that  Me and my brother  And sisters  Sit around  And try to read  Each other's mind  And it just never  Would pan out  Or try to move something  With just brain power 
[02:15:30]  And it's very frustrating  Little matchstick  And nothing  Can't do it  And it's also possible  In another way  We can MRI scan the brain  And when you tell a lie  It takes more energy  Than to tell the truth  Because to tell a lie  You have to know the truth  The cover up  And the consequence  Of the cover up  Well that takes a lot of energy  That can be picked up  With an MRI brain scan  With 98% accuracy  I'm going to scare Steve  Yes I'm straight  I love women  Doctor can you use 
[02:16:00]  Some of those laser powers  To fling this bad  Grout work body  Around the room  This time you come in  For the rest  We're getting at the wall  Colin is pointing  Across the room  And either me or Eric  I can't decide who it is  Well you know  At our university  We have a trillion watt lasers  We have lasers  Trillion watt  Trillion watt lasers  Yeah we can build those things  Plow right through a concrete  Yeah that would get a little hot  Wow  Could you fling him  Like could you bring him  As an experiment  For everybody  Just throw him around the room  And smash him against the wall  Well if we did that  He'd be toast 
[02:16:30]  Literally toast  We can do that  In the laboratory now  However  People ask about ray guns  Right  Then why can't you  Build a ray gun  The problem is  A portable power pack  Right  You can build a laser beam  But you have to have  A nuclear power plant  Behind you to do this  And you can't enter a firefight  In Star Wars  With a nuclear power plant  On your back  No you gotta make that smaller  Yeah that's the problem  With ray guns  Otherwise we could do it  I got one question  What happens to you  When you die  Ah well we don't know  That's one of these  Great eternal questions 
[02:17:00]  However most of my friends  Would essentially say  That when you die  Your memory circuits  Just like your CD-ROM  Just like your hard drive  Goes on the blink  Oh  What happens to a computer  When a hard drive goes out  You know  When you don't have any  Yeah  Means of storage  Uh  What happens  However  What happens  However  I like to have  Give me a however  Okay  However  I need a good however  Right about now  Okay  However  There are two ways  Of attaining immortality  Okay  Two ways  One  We've now isolated 
[02:17:30]  Many of the genes  For the aging process  Uh  SIRD2  Age1  Age2  Many of the genes  Controlling the aging process  Have now been unraveled  And we can double the lifespan  Of almost any animal  That you see  In the animal kingdom  Second of all  My friends who work  On artificial intelligence  Tell me that our descendants  You know  Maybe a hundred years from now  May have an option  Two options  One  Get old  Decrepid  Decay  And die  The other option  Is one day  Merging with our creations  And waking up  With the power 
[02:18:00]  Of a superman  With the body  Of a cyborg  Genetically enhanced  And living forever  With superhuman powers  You know what sucks about that  We're falling just short  Of all that technology  That really  We'll be the last generation  That gets to just drop dead  Right  We're gonna fall just short  After all this time  Great  Well we have to go  We could talk to you all morning  Man  We have to plug  We plug the book too  Dr. Michi Yukaku  Physics of the Impossible  It's number 12  On the best seller list 
[02:18:30]  And uh  And there are a bunch  Of other books  You have out too  Uh  Hyperspace  Beyond Einstein  And a couple more  I can't remember  Uh  Parallel World  And uh  And my website  MKaku.org  M-K-A-K-U  Dot org  And you give some  Great talks I saw  Uh  Like where you just  You sit and just  Explain into a camera  A lot of these things  About black holes  And wormholes  Can they get all that  On your website  Uh yeah  A lot of that's  On the website  And tonight  I'll be doing a chat  A live chat  At 9 o'clock  On my website  Any and all questions  Live chat 
[02:19:00]  Tonight  You can  You can interact  With me directly  Rather than having to  Go through the  Uh radio  Uh tonight  9 o'clock  Be idiot children  Like we are  And just ask them  Questions about science  That you've always  Wanted to know  Physics  MKaku  K-A-K-U  Dot org  And also  Uh  Your same name  On MySpace  Uh that's right  And also check out  You know  YouTube  And things like that  I'm there as well  Match.com  No not there yet  A guy like this  Physicist looking for  A guy like this  Should have the most  Friends ever 
[02:19:30]  On MySpace  Wouldn't you want him  As a friend  Just to make you  Feel a little better  Yeah  No I wouldn't be able  To comfort you  I wouldn't be able  To understand his  Email blasts  Subsequently  We should  All right we have  To get out of here  We're heading over  To XM Satellite Radio  Dr. Kaku  It's a pleasure  Yes  Thank you sir  Absolutely  Okay  The Opie and Anthony  Show  It's M202 
[02:20:00]  In the world of radio  Shock Shocks  The biggest are Opie and Anthony  These people say  Shocking things  That border on offensive  In order to entertain  Their office  I refuse to sit here  And think that radio  Has to be nice  Why?  Why does radio  Out of any other medium  Have to be nice?  We are being now  Held to a standard  Where we have to be nice  And make people feel good  Go screw  Do 
[02:20:30]  Radio Bad Boys  Opie and Anthony  Controversial Radio  Personalities  Opie and Anthony  Infamous DJ  Opie and Anthony  Talk show radio hosts  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Radio Shock Jocks  Opie and Anthony  Shark Jocks  Opie and Anthony gunbroke  NBC Nightly News  All  Uh  Wardrobe  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony 
[02:21:00]  What are you doing in death?  I've been hanging a lot with JFK  He's the life of the party, let me tell you  Why would he be the life of the party?  At the party, he's the one that goes around with the Doritos  And he fills his head with salsa  It's time for people to understand  These are words  If you don't like them, turn the dial  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Here we are at XM Satellite Radio 
[02:21:30]  Colin Quinn has made the walkover  He's got to be tired by now  He was woken up by our insults  And decided to come on down and defend himself today  And he gave us great energy  I appreciate that, Colin  Before we go back to beating you up  I just want to say he gave us great energy this morning  I don't want to get beat up by your partner Phil Spector over here  Phil Spector  Yeah, he's walking around with guns now  Well, I'm just saying  Now he could officially carry  I'm just saying  It's a good feeling 
[02:22:00]  To be able to walk around  My house  With a gun on me  You know I've been a strong advocate  Of my Second Amendment right  To bear arms  And I go out and I buy rifles  And I bought my FS2000  Which is a very  It's like a  A very little bullpup they call it  Very small  Carbine  Carbine  What do you mean?  Is he  And is it automatic?  Semi-auto  Yeah 
[02:22:30]  223  You know  Nice  Pop, pop, pop, pop  Good, good, good  Good gun  But I finally got my pistol permit  Oh, a carry permit or just pistol permit?  Yes, my carry permit  That's kind of amazing  So you can bring it in the car and stuff?  It's great  I love being armed  But let me explain something  When you say  I mean let me clarify  Carry permit  You mean you can carry it on you now  Like for example?  Not in New York City  All right  You gotta get  I'm working on that  How about your car?  I gotta get  Yes  Nice 
[02:23:00]  It says on it  I'll show you  I thought it was gonna break out of the  If anyone rips this up  I'll kill him by the way  See?  It says  I'll hold it  See?  It says right there  Nice  Yeah  It really is nice  It's so great  I really do love the carry permit  If you can see  His picture  Oh, I know  The one guy  It was executed  A joke  Oh yeah  This guy would never get a carry permit  Get that out of here  Come on  That's a great picture of me 
[02:23:30]  Yeah  Hey  Before we  Before we move on  I gotta acknowledge something here  Anyone else  Anyone else think that Dr. Kaku is full of shit?  What?  Full of Kaku?  Yeah  I'm gonna start making up stuff  And I'm gonna start writing books  Cause no one can prove my stuff isn't real or not  Not true  It's all based in like  Mathematics and stuff like that  Oh my god  And brain trust  I believe you have a perfect explanation from Norton  It's all based in mathematics and stuff like that  Well, I mean they do a 
[02:24:00]  You mean you're dumb  It's intelligent guys that you can't even comprehend  Sitting there trading ideologies based on science  That's true  But you have to admit  What I'll be saying is that  Until we have one bit of empirical truth  It's hard to believe this stuff  Yes, thank you  Thank you, Colin  You can't bend light  Do you understand?  How do you know?  I'm coming up with my own stuff  How do you know you can't bend light?  You can't bend light  Because I did an experiment in my house  I took a flashlight  That's right, man  They have bent light  I put a garbage can in front of it  They've shown light being bent by the gravity of planetary and sons 
[02:24:30]  I think Opie and me both get a little suspicious when he said a trashing Einstein  Yeah, I was pissed off about that  You sure did  Einstein had a pencil and a piece of paper  He didn't have computers  Jimmy, that did get me a little bit  Where his next book is Einstein, that douche  Oh, I gotta write this man, Einstein  By the douche man  When he referred to Einstein as the messy Jew  He was just being silly  No, he was just saying that Einstein for 30 years  Struggled with one thing that he picked up on 
[02:25:00]  That's all  He was just saying that he picked up where Einstein left off  Exactly  How great is it?  He's one of the smartest guys in the world  For real  And he's online trolling for broads  What?  Yeah, he said he's gonna be doing a chat  He's doing a chat  It's not like pal talk  He's not on there like  That's his excuse  Looking at girls wowing  That's his excuse  We gotta give him a Saturday Night Virus show  I'm sure that would be very interesting  Oh, okay  No, it's not a good idea  That's a good idea  Jimmy, are you getting any?  How do you open this thing?  Oh, God  Don't get it all over  How do you open this up?  I don't know 
[02:25:30]  They're making a horrible smell  We're smelling your stupid medicated pair  My feet are immaculate  Yeah, mine is  They smell  They don't smell  My feet don't  How do you feed this thing?  Oh, that's gonna go all over the place  The medication smells I'm saying  We're rubbing these up  I'll be using that cheese grater foot thing  Cheese grater egg  I feel like we're in a hospital  The pet egg  Yeah  And I've seen it on infomercials  Where they just sandpaper their feet  And the dry skin flakes  Go into a canister  I'd love to do the other thing instead  If you give me one of those things  How do you open it up?  I don't know  You know those things  Where you put it on the bottom of your foot  The Japanese thing  And it gets all the things out when you sleep 
[02:26:00]  Huh?  Jimmy, how do you open this up?  I don't know  I'll be looking  Leeches?  What are you talking about?  Oh, wow  You know the thing is  Hey, you want some fucking foot skin  How do you open yours up?  You do it from the egg tip  What do you mean?  From the front  You peel it back from the front  Peel it back like this?  Make Norton wear that suit like Hillary  No, I'm not going to do it  You wear a Hillary Clinton suit every day  I don't do it, Carl  Oh, but just your ass  Oh, my God  What are you  Look at this  No  What is it? 
[02:26:30]  Big A's, tons of great beans  That's a bunch of powder  Yeah, God damn it  What, it's used already?  Oh, it's  It's like white powder  Powder  But it came off of your foot  How much would Dave want to eat it?  It looks like something you would have  Oh, he'd eat it  It looks like something you would have snorted  Snort it, man  Cut up some lines  And snort your own foot scrapings  That's  That all came off one foot  That's pretty impressive  That's disgusting  Now what, though?  What does that mean?  It means that your calluses are a little better on your foot  You know, you gotta scrape them  To keep your feet 
[02:27:00]  It's a crock of shit  Who gives a crap  I don't know much  But I call this bad radio  Why?  The listeners will love the fact that we're scraping our feet  Yeah, absolutely  No, they don't  I know, that's stupid  It was sarcasm  Oh  You wear shoes and socks  You bathe every day  You take a shower  And you don't have to worry about it  Jimmy, how many  Aquaman  How much you got?  I don't know  Just a little bit  I'm gonna do this until it, you know  It gets down to the level where it hurts  I'm gonna stand it down to the muscle  Yeah, until I hit bone 
[02:27:30]  I want fucking skeleton feet  Ah, bone scrapings  Great  All right  I think Colin's right now  I'm totally right  Of course  He's the Dr. Cocko of bad radio  He knows it  It's not a theory either  You guys just gotta look at the paper  That's where the great stories are  Look at the top movies  21, Leathernecks, Nims Island, Horton Hussle  I mean, there's you over there  How'd that George Clooney movie?  Do I hurt a fucking bump?  Leatherheads?  Didn't do too well  21 was the number one movie at the box office  For the second week in a row  Thanks to us  Can I push? 
[02:28:00]  No  That's not  What did you guys do about it?  We had him on the shelf  Collegiate Eggheads  Oh yeah, I read that book  One of those books about that  Me too  It's called Bringing Down the House  Yeah, and then they were  They were like two of the same ones  And I was like, all right  We get it the first ten times  We had a nice chat about Steve Martin last night  Did you?  Hey  Yeah, we didn't like the fact that he did  That he did Pink Panther  No, I think that's  Sacrilege  An asshole  Are we getting serious for a moment  Or is there a joke behind that?  Because that's bullshit  No, we didn't like him  We didn't like it  Although that King Tut song 
[02:28:30]  Man, to this day  Makes me laugh every time  To this day, it's just hysterical  He's my favorite  Honky, honky  Honky, oh  I want to do it  You walking around naked  With your guns on  I'm not naked  I'm fully clothed  But I tell you  There is something  That just feels good  About being in your house  With a sidearm  Yeah  With being on  I'm alone in my house  You see the guy  I'm a single guy  He's got a 50-cowl  Mounted in the washing machine  I got it  And you know that 
[02:29:00]  If someone breaks into your home  You're not a fucking victim  Well, that's true  But let's be honest  Anthony is so fucking traumatized  By that childhood violence  Oh, God  That does look like coke  By the way  You scraped cocaine  Off your feet  How much you got?  I don't know  I was trying to tell Norton  About Jimmy Jackson yesterday  He said he didn't recognize  What I was talking about  Jimmy Jackson  You love Jimmy Jackson  Out in California  That guy was crazy  Out in California  Jimmy Jackson  I think Anthony is traumatized  By fucking childhood violence  And he's afraid of violence again  Violence? 
[02:29:30]  Wait, can we get a rock in here?  I'm traumatized by the news  Nah  I hate the news too  I just turn it off sometimes  You gotta  They should call it the bad news  Come here  Give me a high five  Jimmy  What do you mean?  I mean, you have locks in your house, right?  Hold on, hold on  I have locks  You got a camera?  He doesn't  You have locks  You have gates  All that stuff  Jimmy  No, I don't have gates  I have locks  Do what I do  When I was a little kid  You know what I used to do  If I were on a train  The train's very dangerous  When I was a kid  I'd buy a karate magazine  And read it  Well, alright 
[02:30:00]  Problem solved  Because who would be reading it  But a karate master  You don't  I didn't take karate  I just bought the magazine  I read it  Oh, you leave the magazine  No, I sit there on the train  Oh, and then people  Wouldn't screw with you  You know, it's not a bad idea  If you're on the train  This has to be on the website  If you guys can just be here  Disgusting  That medical  Medicinal smell is killing me  It's not the feet  It's the  I'll be scraped  How much is there, really? 
[02:30:30]  Dude, there's a  About a gram  I would say  Based on my past knowledge  I would say about a gram  Wait, Dr. Kakao's on the commercial  Get closer  You're not going to be able to see it  You can't  I'll believe in all of Dr. Kakao's theory  When he does shrink  And what he's already shrunk  Yeah  Alright  They're trying to get a picture  Of the quantity  It's a ridiculous amount  Of  One  Two  Three  Ah 
[02:31:00]  Ah  Ah  Ah  It blew it in E-Rock's face  Ah  Ah  Ah  Ah  E-Rock's got foot powder on him  Oh  Dried foot skin  That's not foot powder  Scrappings  It's dried foot flakes  Why would you fall for that?  He doesn't have a choice  He works for you  He has to do what you say  He just  He just took a  Ah  He was worried you fall  That they made him take a picture  Foot fungus 
[02:31:30]  That's right  You got foot flex blown on him  Ah  That is so disgusting  Alright  Foot flex  Well that bit went well  It was fun  Yeah that was good  That killed five minutes huh  Colin  Good stuff  Yeah  Alright  Another five minutes before we die  I like when Opie goes  What happens after you die?  Well  It's a good question  I think it's a good question  Because there's a whole God thing  It's the ultimate question  A lot of scientists in the God thing  They don't get along with each other  So I want to explain that they do get along  Let's not forget Einstein's great quote  What? 
[02:32:00]  You know  Science without God is idiocy  And so is God without science  Oh really?  He said that?  Yes  No he didn't  He fucking stole that quote  Yeah he did  Einstein stole that quote  He's not acting like you have a connection to Einstein  You don't know anything about him  And he wouldn't have liked you  Wait wait  I do want  What at all  I do want Colin's observations of the interview  Well I honestly  Well  Were we showing like some intelligence  In front of Dr. Kaku you think?  Yeah I thought that  Well I thought that Anthony showed 
[02:32:30]  That he had kind of an interesting grasp  Of those kind of scientific things  That guys like us don't really care about  And then Norton  Norton really had some good  A couple of good things  Like you could tell he really studied  But it was so forced  It was like watching  It was  He was pushing it  I expected a brain hemorrhoid out of him  No  He was put  Shut up and let me finish  Please Jimmy  You're being out of line  You're a phony  Who was trying to fit in  With the doctor  Whereas Anthony spent a lifetime  Researching that stuff  Three years ago  Three years ago 
[02:33:00]  You decided  You know what  I'm really going to bone up  On some of my scientific knowledge  And you started reading  But I can tell you  Almost had a headache  Doctor  Everything you did was a strain  And I felt it  No no no  What happens is this  The doctor and I were discussing a few things  I wanted to discuss the distance to Alpha Centauri  But he blew by it  So I was fine with that  You knew the distance  Of course I did  Of course  The light year is six trillion miles  Everybody knows that  You know why it's called a light year  Yes because that's the distance 
[02:33:30]  Light will travel within a year  It's not as heavy as another type of year  It's less filling  Him asking  Him asking  Has less calories  Him asking the distance  It was comparable to this morning  When he started asking  If you've changed flights  On your trip  Yeah  Light travels a certain distance  In a year  Yes  Approximately six trillion miles  A lot of people think  Light year  Is a measure of time 
[02:34:00]  No it's distance  When it is distance  Six trillion miles  Yes  I just hope what that guy said comes true  Because it would be kind of exciting  Yeah but we never said that shit  That's the same thing with the 50s  When they were talking about the 80s  And 70s  We will have moon bases  It would be wonderful  But no  What he does in his book  Is he goes over stuff  And he tells you like  These crazy things  That were in science fiction  Your finger doesn't make you an intellectual  That's true  I love when you would rip him  On your show too 
[02:34:30]  Yeah  Because Jimmy would like  Yeah  He'd put his finger up on his chin  And be like  Or he'd put his chin  Between his thumb  And forefinger  It was like  It was like a silent movie version  Of an intelligent guy  And Colin would not let  A moment slip by  He would not let that moment leave  He'd have to call you out on it  Every time you tried to sound smart  Well that's what Colin likes to do  He likes to knock a man down  While he's making a point  That's fine for Colin  But I had some very valid points 
[02:35:00]  With a good doctor  A couple of men of similar ilk  Of course  Disgusting space and time travel  And theorizing  About making things go bye bye  As I would say  Now if you took the distance  That you need to push a Porsche  For it to start  With a dead battery  That's right  And multiplied it by  That's right  The age of the comic pushing it  That's not a light year  That's a wish I was lighter year  See how he  Oh so this is how it gets  Over here next time  It gets a little saucy 
[02:35:30]  You guys are going to play  On the other show  A little saucy  The salty show  Mario  That's right  I'm not going to put up  I'm not going to put up  With any of this nonsense  I'm going to see  What they're up to  In Gasoline Alley  I'm going to find out  What they're up to  In Gasoline Alley  Don't do Jimmy's bit  Jimmy reads the comics  Does he really?  Yes he certainly does  Shoot I'm sorry  I'm doing Jimmy's  He does a fine job  With it  I'm sorry  I didn't mean to do  Jimmy's bit  That Michael Keaton  Did on Letterman in 81  Oh  What did he do?  I don't know  I didn't watch 
[02:36:00]  Letterman in 81  I wasn't doing stand up  Back then  85  Whatever it was  I guess not  Thief  Anyway  I never saw  Michael Keaton do that  I'm not a big fan of his  What did he do?  On Letterman  Doesn't matter  You stole it  So it's yours  No fucking LaGuardia  He stole it from LaGuardia  Yeah Fiorello LaGuardia  Did it when they  Had the strike or something  Exactly  He'd read the funny papers  Read the funny papers  Michael Keaton's a cunt  And he took the idea from me  We're getting called out  On instant feedback  About what?  Steve Martin writes  Steve Martin writes  For guys that hate Steve Martin 
[02:36:30]  Thanks for stealing my light year joke  Out of Roxanne  Same as a regular year  Just less calories  And then he writes  Hack  No one stole that joke  No one remembers  What joke is this?  When he said  What's a light year?  My first joke was not as heavy  As another year  Of course  And the only other place  You can go with that  That's not like accurate  Is there  So it wasn't stolen  You fucking  Dummy  You son of a bitch  There's two angles  You can go on  Yeah  Ass  Hole  Well that's true  Now let me just pick  My light heavy year 
[02:37:00]  You could have gone  For the light heavy year  I did  Like a period joke  I did  Oh period joke  Light heavy  I don't know  I'm going there  That would be a lot  Of periods Colin  Look at  Fucking God  Alright we got a little story  We're going to start  Doing radio now  Alright let's try this  On for size  Yes  South Australian police  Are monitoring  Their father and daughter  Who've revealed  They are a couple  And have a child together  John and Jenny Deaves 
[02:37:30]  Were reunited  30 years after  Mr Deaves  Separated from Jenny's mother  They told 60 Minutes  They fell in love  And now have a daughter together  The couple said  They knew it was wrong  But emotions took over  John and I  Are in this relationship  As consenting adults  That we are not  Harming each other  Along with  Nine month old Celeste  Jenny has two other children  Aged nine and fourteen  From previous relationships  She's a slut  She's a dirty 
[02:38:00]  Not from a previous relationship  She said from previous relationships  You dirty cow  And now she's fucking her dad  Fucking gay  She's fucking her own dad  That's disgusting  Their daughter has  Two heads  And four arms  When you recognize  Your own smell  Like  Ugh  I don't know  I don't know if your daughter  Has the same smell  Probably deep down  There's a similar smell  Deep down  That's when you're in bed  Having sex with your daughter  You don't know what's the point 
[02:38:30]  Smells like a fucking wallaby pouch  You're filthy  Ugh  That's fucked up, huh?  But even the doctor  Was alluding to that  Remember he kept saying  People are gonna come back  And fuck themselves  Yeah  There's the Dr. Kaku  Yes  There it is  The finger  The finger's up  There it is  Dr. Steve  Texted me  Dr. Steve's a very bright guy  No he's not  Is that Dr. Kakao?  He puts fingers in guys' assholes  For our enjoyment  You made him  Dr. Steve?  Yes, Dr. Steve  Is a very intelligent man  But he said he almost got his degree in physics 
[02:39:00]  But he said that Dr. Kaku said some suspect things  But I don't think he did  Like  Anything that a suspect  Has almost got a degree in something?  It's not  It's been proven for 20 years  That tidal forces around a black hole  Will turn you into a string of atoms  Hardly Alice through the looking glass  As that clown said  Whoa  See  Whoa  Calling you out  A couple of doctors  Let's write our own book  But I certainly think  That had Dr. Steve called in with that  I'm sure that Michio would have given a little 
[02:39:30]  A little smile at the ignorance of it  And  Wow  Dr. Steve is being called out now  Only on that  Because Kaku is  You know  He hangs  He knows Stephen Hawking  He's one of these guys  Yeah but  So he knows somebody  He knows someone that can't talk  He consorts with him  Like see  He always theorized  That there were black holes  Or things like that  And time travel  And Hawking said  There was no time travel  And Hawking said to him  But he was wrong  Oh no  It is Dr. Kaku again  Please tell him  I am not in  But you're Stephen Hawking 
[02:40:00]  You're always in  You can't really go anywhere  I do not want to talk to that douche  His eyes only move  Now he said  That's it  When chicks walk by  I bet  Yeah  He still looks  Oh man  Chicks dig me  I like to interview Stephen Hawking  And just go  Hurry up  What  Come on  Talk  We don't have all day  So what is Dr. Steve  Is really slandering about  Dr. Steve doesn't like  The whole idea of the black hole  And being able to use a black hole  Because as I brought up  To Dr. Kaku  Black hole would crush you 
[02:40:30]  The gravity itself  Sucks in light  It sucks in light itself  But then  So any type of human  Even in the most  Technologically advanced  Type of craft  Would be crushed  Now that's what he's saying  But it would turn you  To a string of atoms  But Dr. Kaku said  That now they're saying  They think it's a ring  It's different than  They once believed  Which is convenient  Well why else would he say that  Because it's convenient  When they photograph  Thousands of them  To get laid  Why do people do a lot of shit 
[02:41:00]  He would make  He would make  Just a kooky statement  Well  No he'd make a kaku statement  That almost sounds kooky  But I think  That's kind of convenient  That they'll say  It's a ring  That way you could  Shoot through the middle of it  Yeah  Let me ask you something  If he was as really  As good as you say  Why would he make himself  An instant judo master  You think when these physicists  Get together  They have jokes  Like physics  Physics jokes  Of course they do  Physics jokes 
[02:41:30]  No  Sure they do  They're all  They're the same jokes  They're end jokes  Yeah  It doesn't matter  What you do for a living  Yeah  Oh fuck  We should ask Dr. Kaku  Steven Hawkins  Checking in from space  Earth  Earth's days are numbered  We could have got that  You know what  That I believe  How much long we got left  What did Steven Hawkins mean  When he said that  Earth's days are numbered  You gotta read his books  I've looked at  No pictures  I don't like them  He gives you all the fucking 
[02:42:00]  Theory and stuff  He doesn't just speculate  He goes through all the fucking  The physics theories and stuff  He tries to keep it simple  What do you think about  What he said  Bob Kelly  What do you think about  What he said  Dude  You know what  We like to believe  We're the only ones here  Dude  But it's bullshit  You know  Just a bunch of  Shmarmy assholes  Dude  Just trying to be like  The only people  Oh god damn  That is so dead on  You know what  Colin

[02:43:00]  Yeah  There's some issues  Of Dr. Steve  And I  Are gonna have  A physics  Well why doesn't  Dr. Steve  Call the show  So we can have it out  He's probably  With a patient  He's a psychopath  He fucking has  The headphones in  And he's probably  Right now  Telling one of  The kids retarded  And he's fucking  Texting me  I just get a text message  Tell that ass  Norton  Stop talking  With an accent  From Bobby  Why didn't Bobby  Call the show  Someone better  Call his fucking show  So he can just be  Lambasted  Yes  You know what

[03:00:00]  And the reason he lost him  Is because the fucking car  Slammed into an abutment  And right now  His fucking phone and arm  Are attached  But not to the rest of his body  His hand is holding that phone  In the fucking ditch somewhere  While the rest of his body  Is propelled to the fucking windshield  Dad  I got no phone around  Dad  You know what dad  They make a lot of things  For left handed people  Shut up  And his phone's  Holding a copy  His arm's holding a copy 
[03:00:30]  Of his CD  He had tucked under his fat arm  There's a fucking copy  Of his CD  That he was going to try  To give back to the radio station  But they just left it on the table  As we wait for Bob Kelly  To call back  Good news for Colin Quinn  We got more Scorch for you  Scorch  Young Sam  Back in studio  Working hard today  Young Sam  What do we got  Well  This  I went into my personal  Archives  And found some classic Scorch  From Syracuse  Oh Syracuse  Was this when he was doing  The Kingdom of Nakedism 
[03:01:00]  This was the Naked Militia era  Oh Naked Militia  Basically  Paulie  Finally  His sidekick  Started voicing his concerns  About the fact that Scorch  Insisted on  Doing top fives  Every single day  To which  Scorch decided  The best thing to do  Would be to do  An on air bit  Where he would challenge  Paulie  And Paulie would have to  Come up with a top five list  And then Scorch  Would come up with a top five list  And then we'd see  Whose is better  So I thought  I'd bring him in  And then we could see  Whose is better  Wow  This is good 
[03:01:30]  This is unbelievable  We can participate in this then  Good  So my top list that I do  You're always  Man that's not funny  And I think they're funny  The other day you did  Things you hear at a car wash  That sounds sexual  And I've never heard  One of those things  At a car wash  Go ahead  But now you've  And you didn't like  The ones I did about  Things you'd hear at a cook say  Yeah let's hear those again  No you go with yours first  Here's the top five  Because mine's not funny either  Go ahead  Top five things  That a baseball announcer  May say  That could be 
[03:02:00]  Construed as sexual  Alright you ready for this  Number five  He smacked it into the gap  That's good  Alright  Number four  Scorch is like  I know it's a competition  But I'll be fair  That's good  That's good  Now see the bid here  Would be to make believe  It's good when  The whole world  Knows it's not  It just stinks  But Scorch really thinks  This stuff is good  He's ready to get  That's good  That's good  I wish I'd thought of that  That was him saying  That's good  Alright  Number four  The pitcher steps off the mound 
[03:02:30]  And eyes the rubber  Good  That's good  That's funny  It's not funny  Scorch is so digging this  Pauly wrote it  And it's like  This is not funny Scorch  See Pauly's  No it's good  It's good  Pauly's doing his impression  Of Scorch  This is not funny  Pauly's not trying to be funny  No  But he's trying to find stuff  That might be funny  If it was Scorch riding it  Right  Okay  The Scorch  This is just  The best shit he's ever heard  That's the Scorch equivalent  Of touche 
[03:03:00]  That is hilarious  I can say that's not funny  Number three  He just got to first base  That's really easy  Go ahead  Number two  The shortstop  Went deep in the hole  Yeah  And number one  This guy  Hits balls deep  See I think  Good for you  That's funny  Good for you  What do you think  Is not funny about that  Everything  Everything  He's so frustrated  He couldn't believe 
[03:03:30]  That his point  Was illustrated  Oh my god  Pretty stiff  And then Scorch  Was forced to do  His own top five  Yeah one of his  Classic top fives  This was top five things  You wouldn't want to hear  A chef saying  At a restaurant  Ah you wouldn't  Okay  Okay now the ones I did  Top five things  You wouldn't want to hear  A cook say  When they're making your food  Okay  Okay here we go  Number five  I know it's stale  But what the hell  We'll just tell him  It's toasted  Number four  You got all the dust  Off of that didn't you
