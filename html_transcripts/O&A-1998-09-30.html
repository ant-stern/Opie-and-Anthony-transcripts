<pre> Sofie and Anthony?  Hello.  Just got a Red Sox score.  The Indians are leading the Red Sox 7-3 in the sixth inning.  Playoff baseball is here.  Yeah.  Yankees looked great yesterday.  I have officially jumped on the Yankee bandwagon.  Well, you know, you have to if you're a little match choked down.  But I think that's what you've got to do when you're in New York.  You either like to match the Yankees and then when your team's out of it, I hope most people  jump on board and support the team.  That's all.  I would have loved to see the Mets in the playoffs, but. 
[00:30]
 They had the big choke, as we all know, so David Wells.  Man, great game.  Is he a scary pitcher or what?  It's great.  The Mets are scary.  The Yankees are a scary team.  Yeah, I know.  I just want to see the Yankees play the Red Sox, actually.  That'll be fun.  That's always fun.  A lot of fun, actually.  Hey, you want to play on Piss Off at Texan today?  I think it's appropriate. 
[01:00]
 Do we have any prizes that we could give away if we play our fine game, Piss Off at Texan,  at Texan in honor of the Yankees playing the Rangers?  If we have to go out and pillage offices for prizes, we will find something.  All right.  That we can give away.  I think we have some of our lovely Opie and Anthony t-shirts later on the joint.  Really?  Yeah, with our baby pictures.  I don't know how.  Good for dining or disco desk and den.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Well, I guess we got to figure out if we got prizes. 
[01:30]
 Yeah.  We got a fine game.  We'd love to play it this afternoon.  Yeah, this is good because the Texas Rangers playing the Yankees.  And we all want them to lose.  Yes.  So let's, yeah, piss off at Texan.  Well, you got to have bullies because basically what we do is we get you on the line with  a random Texan and you got 30 seconds to make them hang up without telling them to hang up.  You can't curse them out.  You just got to be very creative in your wording.  And your words.  You can't make this person hang up in 30 seconds. 
[02:00]
 Yeah, you can't threaten them.  No, you know, like, like, oh, I'm going to kill you.  You got to just take them off with your humor, your intelligence, your wit, your wit.  That's it.  Without cursing.  And if we had a good prize, we'll give the people a prize if they could accomplish that.  Let's dig up some prizes and play.  All right, we'll dig up some prizes and we will do that.  Also, two one two seven five seven one oh two seven.  If you got something today, the facts line two one two nine five seven W.  Any W. It's very interesting getting lots of taxes. 
[02:30]
 People are making us part of their preset in the car and we thank you for that.  Here's a person.  What's her name?  I know.  Just made us preset number one on the car.  Thank you.  And the reason?  Because he loved the road rage bit yesterday.  We did on our show.  Really?  That's interesting.  I know.  Because the boss didn't like that one.  Isn't that weird?  So we gained a listener for doing a bit.  The boss hated.  All right.  That's good.  All right.  What do you got for the instant feedback? 
[03:00]
 At W.  Any W.  Dot com.  Click on our pictures and you could instantly email us here in the studio.  Very good.  On the way, we got the latest from Johnny Lang and Derek and the dominoes.

He's out in the lobby.  Skid Marks is out there in the lobby with his mom.

 Yeah.  Yeah.  Fun kid.  Wants to be a stand up comic.  I guess he performs at Carolines we have found out.  Performs all over.  Yeah.  He's 11 years old or or is he 12?  12.  12.  Okay.  Right here.  He's done all the goofy songs you've heard on the radio in the last couple days.  We heard some disturbing news about his fart song.  I guess we got to get him in here to explain all this.  Yeah, we should do that.  Well, okay.  There's him and his mom. 
[04:00]
 They're they're quite a team out there.  Yeah.  So she she writes all the music.  Or performs the music.  Or music.  Yeah.  And he does his own writing.  Yeah.  I'm just in shock over what I heard about the fart song.  All right.  That'll be a good tease.  Stick around to hear Skid Marks talk about his fart song.  It's pretty amazing.  Actually, and we're going to play play piss off a Texan today.  I want to do that.  All right.  Boss.  Do we have any prizes?  We have anything we could give away. 
[04:30]
 Like really anything we give away a car today.  Sure.  Who's having mine?  Yeah, whose car whose car like Scott Muniz car or something.  Can we give that away?  That's a model.  He got to have him that away.  Get up while he's on the air though.  That wouldn't be too hard.  We have prizes because we want to play this fun little game.  Absolutely.  Well, we have the listeners piss off Texans.  Well, what could it be?  We you know, we need some incentive.  Do we have like a Kaja Gugu CD or something?  We can give them.  The Kaja Gugu box set.  Right. 
[05:00]
 The box set.  The Vanilla we have.  Really?  Vanilla.  Great.  Do we have any prizes here at this point?  We have t-shirts.  We have the Opie and Anthony t-shirts, right?  You're right.  See that's look the phones aren't ringing for that.  They want something better than that.  Yeah, they need something better than an Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  Yeah, I won't even wear an Opie and Anthony t-shirt at this point.  Okay, so you don't want music.  Well, we want good music.  Okay.  Yeah, put together like a CD package or something.  Yeah.  What would you like?  Like who would you like?  John Mellicamp.  We can do that.  Who else?  How about Brian Setzer is cool. 
[05:30]
 Yeah.  Brian Setzer done.  Okay.  Who else?  It means you have to bring yours back in from home.  Can you remember tomorrow?  Yeah, Johnny Lang.  Put it up in a sandwich bag.  Slightly used.  I saw some Johnny Langs back there in Andrew's office.  Yeah.  So we could like put some CD packages together and an Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  All right.  All right.  We'll do that.  Should we get college for this?  Yes, right now.  So we're going to do it. 
[06:00]
 Yes, we're playing.  Hits off a Texan.  You got to have woolies.  You got to be brave.  Quick on your feet.  Quick on your feet.  You got to get a Texan to hang up in 30 seconds.  Yeah.  Without cursing them out.  You can't use any profanity.  You got to use your intellect, your wit, your humor.  Can't threaten them.  Can't threaten them.  You can't tell them to hang up.  Can't tell them you're part of a radio contest.  And you have to talk.  You can't just sit there silent.  Yes.  And we'll conference you with a live breathing Texan.  And you got 30 seconds to get them to hang up.  And if you, you know, accomplish that, we'll give you this lovely Opie and Anthony 
[06:30]
 prize package.  Look at the phones now.  Look at the phones now.  See?  There you go.  I like that.  I think it was the Johnny Lang CD that turned everyone on.  So, all right.  1027WNEW, the Rock of New York.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony on the way.  We got some great rock and roll.  Some ZZ Top also.  Split End is a song you haven't heard in a while.  And look who has made his way into the NEW studios.  It's Skid Marks.  He's becoming a cult figure on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, it is Skid Marks.  How are you, bro?  Good. 
[07:00]
 And you?  Pretty good.  The listeners, the listeners love you.  Is that it?  Really?  And is that your mom over there?  Yes, that's my mom.  Pull up a mic there, mom.  And what's your name?  Mrs. Marks.  Mrs. Marks.  Mrs. Marks.  So, you guys are going to sing some songs today.  Actually, Skid Marks will be performing today for us.  Yes, I am.  Okay.  Skid Marks gave us a tape of some of his ditties that we played on our show yesterday.  You might remember Skid Marks from Friday show where he called in with the Monica song. 
[07:30]
 Very good.  You wrote that?  Yes, I did, actually.  And what does mom play the piano?  No, that's a recording of a no song Gary, Indiana.  Right.  Yeah, and then we get the part where there's no words and then that's where I did the song.  Very good.  You know how many people had that song stuck in their head this weekend because of you, Skid Marks?  A catchy ditty, I must say.  So then we found out that Skid Marks has done other song parodies.  So he sends a FedEx package yesterday with a couple of them.  Yeah.  And a lot of people liked your, I liked the fart song, Skid Marks. 
[08:00]
 It's pretty funny.  And we just found out some disturbing news about this song.  Right, mom?  Kind of.  Now, I thought those fart noises in I Like to Fart were made with like your mouth.  You know how you just like that?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course you do.  You're 12.  Of course you know how to make fart noises.  But I find out that they were real.  Yeah, we ate three whole cans of chili the night before. 
[08:30]
 You and mom?  Mm-hmm.  And then when we were sleeping, we were like, I got one.  I got one.  And then we ran over to the microphone and recorded it.  We got the best ones and recorded them on it.  Wait a minute.  Did you record your mom's farts at this point too?  Uh-huh.  A touching family moment.  So mom, did some of your farts make it into the actual song or?  Yes, they did.  A family that farts together stays together.  Wow.  Don't tell me yours was a more bassy one. 
[09:00]
 Mine was a sweet, quiet one.  No.  Yours was a loud one, like horns.  Yeah.  Hey mom, how old are you?  I'm 43.  43 and you're farting with your kid.  I kind of like that actually.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, I think I'm going to go home and fart with my parents.  I'm going to bond with them in that way.  Family values.  So, um, thankfully after we found out that the farts in I like to fart are actually real. 
[09:30]
 We have decided not to allow skid marks to perform that song live on the show today.  No, not till we get more adequate ventilation here in the studio.  Yes, but what we're going to do is we'll play skid marks.  I like to fart here.  Okay.  So check it out in case you missed it yesterday and just, uh, just keep in mind these farts are real.  I got a song for you.  Anyone out there want to pull my finger?  I like to fart.  I'm a master of this art. 
[10:00]
 I pass a lot of air through my derriere.  No one can surpass.  My skill of passing gas.  My technique of ripping farts is highly state of art. 
[10:30]
 That last one, whose was that?  Mom.  That was yours, mom?  I confess.  Oh man.  How about that?  What the heck is going on here?  Man, nice.  Why are you turning red, mom?  I hope she's not trying to force one out.  Yeah, don't get so embarrassed that you let one sneak through.  All right.  Skid marks is sitting there while the song is playing and pointing out who did each individual fart. 
[11:00]
 Yeah, each fart he'd point to either himself or his mom.  And I must say all the loud ones in that song came from mom.  Yeah.  All right, great.  So skid marks is going to hang out with us a little bit today.  You're going to do a tune for us.  You're going to do the Monica song, the Phil and Monica song.  Now you actually perform at nightclubs?  Yeah, I do a bunch of song parodies that I perform at Caroline's.  Look at this kid.  Me and Anthony can't even get in on stage at Caroline's. 
[11:30]
 How'd you figure that one out?  All right.  Very good.  Wow, a talented kid.  All right, we'll explain his Titanic song and the Monica song.  He's going to stick around for a while.  Yeah.  Also on the way next, we're going to play a round of Piss Off a Texan.  Yeah.  Yanks are going to sweep the ranges.  Everybody knows it.  So it's time to just mess with the Texans.  Yeah, mess with Texas.  We got some fine prizes and we'll do that next.  The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW with the wall flowers. 
[12:00]
 Split ends before that.  I got you.  It's Opie and Anthony hanging today with skid marks and his lovely mother.  They have come down to perform a few of their ditties.  Mrs.  Marks Mrs.  Marks in the studio.  We found out she she could fart louder than her son that she did the backup  farting on the fart song.  Yes.  And the Monica song is on the way and that's what turned us on to skid marks.  If you were listening last Friday, and I think we're even going to put skid marks  in the imaginary ballroom.  We only, you know, put special people in the imaginary ballroom skid marks. 
[12:30]
 For his live performance.  Yeah, we're going to put you in there so you can perform the Monica song.  And that's going to happen the next time we talk.  But right now we got to play piss off a Texan.  Well, David Wells, I think pissed off a Texan a bunch of Texans last night.  Huh?  Yeah, he looked great.  Yankees look great.  Obviously.  So now it's your turn to piss off a Texan.  Yeah, we got a guy Ed on the line who's going to attempt this game.  It's real simple.  We we call up random Texan.  You're on the phone line.  We conference you.  You can't curse at the guy. 
[13:00]
 You can't tell him it's part of a radio promotion or whatever.  And you got 30 seconds to make the guy hang up 30, huh?  Yeah.  Well, we'll get if it's good.  We'll give him leeway.  You know, all right.  We're not going to like stop the thing after 30 seconds.  Yeah.  I mean if they're getting into some good battles, we got to let it go.  We'll be the sole judge.  Yeah, pretty much.  You do a good job pissing them off.  We'll give you this fine.  Opie and Anthony prize package, which is a Opie and Anthony t-shirt and some CDs.  That's all we can muster up around here.  Yeah, for now. 
[13:30]
 We're growing every day though.  Lots of positive email, you know, last night.  So I'm going to bring in our own CDs to give away pretty much.  But here we go.  Let's get it on the line here.  Eddie, you want to play piss off a Texan?  Yeah, why not?  All right.  You know what you're going to do?  Pretty much.  You got 30 seconds.  You can't tell him you're part of a radio thing and you can't curse at him.  Okay.  Can I say something about his family and stuff?  Yeah, piss them off.  It's a piss off a Texan.  Okay.  Speak up, Eddie.  Here he comes.  Texas by with his Jenny. 
[14:00]
 Hey Kenny.  Sir.  This is Mr.  Hill.  Yes, sir.  Are you the rootin' it's tootin' it's straight shootin' it's Texan this side of the pesos?  Is this Boomhauer?  Not Boomhauer, you dummy.  Hey, how much of the Rangers going to lose by today?  Now the Rangers taking the next three.  They got David Wells out of the way.  Give me a break.  Are you married?  Yes, sir.  I heard you go to family reunions to pick up women.  You big imbecile.  So the easiest women in this country are in my family. 
[14:30]
 Yeah, I bet.  Probably your mom and your sister and everybody else.  You wear one of them stupid 10 gallon hats?  Yes, sir.  How big's your mom?  She's huge.  She's huge?  Yeah, like she's about 500 pounds.  Hey, if I kicked your sister in the mouth, would you be circumcised?  You don't get that, huh?  You don't get that one, do you?  I hate Texas.  And you.  Eddie. 
[15:00]
 Yo.  Great job, man.  Did I work it out?  Yeah, we're going to give you a prize for that.  You know it.  He hung up in there somewhere.  Hold on the line, brother.  All right.  1027 WNAW, the Rock of New York with the Googledolls.  That's their latest slide off Dizzy of the Girl.  It's Sophie and Anthony.  Earl just entered the studio and he's scared because Skidmark's mom  asked him if she could, you know, fart on his hand.  Earl, come on, take one for the team.  I don't think she could work one up that fast. 
[15:30]
 Could you?  What would you say?  Can I guess?  Wait, Skidmark's mom wants to fart.  Can you work one up or what?  I'll let you know when I'm ready.  What a mess.  There must be a ball at the PTA.  Yes, good mark.  This is your saving it for Earl.  We'll make something happen for you.  No.  All right.  That's your mom's good marks.  Are you proud of her? 
[16:00]
 Yes.  You did not answer that family.  Yeah.  She go to school with you and stuff like for the parent teacher thing.  No, and I don't want her to.  I don't blame you.  She might fart and then that would like ruin your whole career.  Yeah, and then they put F on my report cards for fart.  There you go.  So Skidmark's mom, you know, we'd really like you to fart.  So if you got one, just raise your hand and we'll let you know.  Okay.  Well, we'll step aside and allow you that the privilege of farting. 
[16:30]
 I think you'll be the first one to fart in here.  Yeah, because Anthony doesn't let me fart anymore.  No, he did it once and I had ran out of the studio.  I had a run.  It was not fun.  So if you don't know who Skidmark's is, he's our new pal.  We feel honored that he has stopped by the any W studios.  He's saying a little Monica.  I keep saying Monica, but it's a song about Monica and Bill.  It's actually the Chelsea Clinton song.  Yeah, he did a Friday and you got a couple emails on that, right? 
[17:00]
 Yeah, people love it.  Yeah, he said they were having a bad day and they heard the song  and it like made him happy.  Yes, until it got stuck in their head for three days straight.  Yeah, then they wanted to and now they will go to the lump hammer.  Yeah, now they want to sit on you.  I didn't want to fart on your face.  So Skidmark's has a bunch of goofy little songs.  We played his fart song earlier.  Yeah, we're going to do the Chelsea song here and we got a couple other  ditties, you know, we'll throw out throw on throughout the show.  He's going to perform this one live.  Yeah, that's cool. 
[17:30]
 And then we will get into the Titanic song in the Charles Groten hair  piece song, which is my favorite actually Skidmark.  Yeah, make sure his music's up real loud.  Okay.  All right.  Your music is ready to go and Skidmark's whenever you're ready.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  Take it brother.  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lying and the way he cheated on her with  Monica.  Mama reads the papers all about my daddy's capers and she calls him a husky  lovin' man. 
[18:00]
 If you'd like to have a little explanation about what I heard during the latest  conversation, I will say without some moments of hesitation,  Oh mama did once shout, I'm broken out, get out.  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lying and the way he cheated on her with  Monica.  His Christian values have gone to hell these days.  Now he's a God-fearing, husky lovin' man. 
[18:30]
 If you'd like to have a little explanation about what I heard during the  latest conversation, I will say without some moments of hesitation,  Oh mama did once shout, bro get out, get out.  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lying and the way he cheated on her with  Monica.  Mama reads the papers all about my daddy's capers and she calls him a husky 
[19:00]
 lovin' man.  Woo!  Come on, guys!  Skid Marks!  Doing it live!  Great job!  You're kidding me!  Do you do radio?  We need some DJs around here.  Yeah, I think the boss will hire you to do a show here at this point.  Actually, if he got on the air staff, that would make the average age of the air  staff here 86.  That could actually bring it way down.  Very nice.  Well, Skid Marks is hanging with us today.  We'll do the Titanic song in a little while and some other ditties. 
[19:30]
 Great job, Skid Marks.  Hey, mom.  Mom, how's that fart coming?  It's coming.  It's coming and stick around for the finale.  Skid Marks' mom will be farting.  What a mess we got going on here today.  Yeah!  We love it!  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York with the latest from Hold Up.  Celebrity Skin.  I like that song a lot, but who cares?  Actually, the CD is getting great reviews.  Yes, it is.  And I haven't tracked through it yet.  I'm surprised in myself because I like Courtney Love and I want to check it out. 
[20:00]
 But...  Tracked through it, huh?  Yeah, that's a DJ lingo.  Yeah, I got to track through it to decide which songs are good and which songs aren't that great.  Yeah, it's cool to talk like that, Ann.  Oh, I didn't realize that.  I'm sorry.  Hey, can every day be a Jewish holiday, please?  I love the traffic.  You know, Jewish holidays every day of the year.  The traffic was non-existent driving in.  Absolutely non-existent.  We cut what?  50% off our time.  Yes.  It was awesome.  Fax is coming in. 
[20:30]
 Foot writes, Skid Marks is a god.  Get me his autograph and get mom's autograph too.  All right.  Look at that.  You got fans, Skid Marks.  He's warming up for his Titanic song, which we're going to do in a little while.  And mom is warming up to fart.  Right, mom?  She's working it.  You're working it?  Can we help you along?  Is there any foods you need or maybe some hot chocolate or something?  I like to do that.  Some X-LACS.  Yeah, Skid Marks, what type of food does mom need to fart really well? 
[21:00]
 I think she needs junk food.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's her favorite junk food?  Because we got tons of faithful listeners.  They'll run some junk food up here for the pleasure of seeing us.  Maybe I could just like swallow like a fizzy hole or something like that.  Like an alka-selt or something.  Yeah?  Wow.  All right.  You're not going to let us down there.  You're going to fart before the end of the show, right?  I swear.  Just sit there and simmer.  All right.  Yeah, just hang out.  We'll get to you in a little bit.  We also have another guy on the line who wants to play Piss Off at Texan.  All right.  Now we're going to do this game, you know, for the rest of the week until the, you know, 
[21:30]
 the Yankees sweep the Rangers.  Yes.  And we want them to get better.  Simple as that.  The first guy that did it, he was pretty good.  Yeah.  But we need some really creative witty people out there.  The game is simple.  We put you on the line with a random Texan.  They got 30 seconds to make them hang up.  Angry.  Right.  You got to be angry.  Right.  That's all.  And you can't curse.  You can't tell them it's part of a radio program, you know?  And what you got to do is you got to get creative with your, your baseball knowledge 
[22:00]
 and your baseball abuse.  And you have to have some good like mama jokes and stuff and book downs.  Better get skid marks to do one.  I bet he could piss off a Texan.  He probably could.  All right.  Let's talk to Kyle here.  Kyle, you want to play Piss Off at Texan?  Of course.  All right.  You got 30 seconds to make this random Texan hang up the phone and you can't curse at them  and you can't tell them you're on the radio.  All righty.  Anything else goes.  You can do mama abuse, whatever it takes.  All righty.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Thanks. 
[22:30]
 Make sure you speak up, all right brother?  All righty.  Here it comes.  Show in.  This is Wendy Penelope.  Yeah.  Hi, this is Kyle from the New York Daily News.  I'd like to know what you think about the New York Yankees.  How they're going to kick the Rangers ass tonight.  I don't see it happening.  Oh, hell no.  Wang and Ziles ain't going to do nothing.  Just wait till you see Andy Pettis split or go right off Will Clark's nose, huh?  This is Steve.  Hello.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hi, this is Kyle from the New York Daily News.

Andy Pettis is going to take that stinker and throw it all over the place.  He couldn't carry Haley's job.  Get the hell out of here.  Wang and Ziles 0 for freaking 3.  Not to mention that.  Hey, he's smelt my nutsack.  Let's just, let's just.  No, get out.  No, you know what they, go walk on your 10 gallon hat.  Okay.  Why don't you go eat some beef jerky while you're at it? 
[23:30]
 Freaking Texas can't do anything to New York here.  New York, baby.  Number one.  Going all the way.  Ain't got nothing to say, huh?  I think he hung up.  All right.  I do believe we have a winner.  All right.  Congratulations, Kyle.  Thank you.  Not bad.  You got a little nervous when you heard the guy answer.  Yeah, screwed me up.  Cause I mean, you gave me two people.  There you go.  You had to go through two of them for the open.  Yeah, right.  I can hold on the line.  All right.  All right.  Thanks.  I know we could do better than what Kyle just did. 
[24:00]
 Yeah.  Well, he was very knowledgeable on his baseball.  Yeah, you know, he was throwing that at him pretty good.  But we're looking for anger looking for anger and we're looking for a little sparring too.  You got to allow the other guy to get in a little bit.  We want the people in Texas to hang up and feel bad for the rest of the day.  Yeah, that you insulted them so badly.  Of course.  That's what we need.  We're New Yorkers for Christ's sake.  We can do a better job than that.  All right.  We'll put together another prize package.  Yeah, well, we'll give it one more try. 
[24:30]
 We're going to do this throughout the week.  So we got some CDs into you.  We're looking for the witty, you know, the and some some wit to you.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So make the Texan hang up and go.  Well, what the hell happened to me?  What the hell is that?  Holy Jesus.  Tell me no.  There you go.  One oh two seven W.N.A.W.  The Rock of New York with Kiss Rock and Roll all night party every day.  It's Opie and Anthony and Skid Marks and Skid Marks mom.  If you're just tuning into the show, our new pal Skid Marks has stopped by for a little visit. 
[25:00]
 We enjoyed his Chelsea Clinton song.  So we decided to have him in.  Yeah, last Friday that was.  Yeah, and he's got a few ditties that he wanted to sing for everyone today.  Mm hmm.  We all got a Titanic song.  Yeah, I think that's the one we're going to do now.  All right.  And also if you stick around, we got a little treat for you guys today.  Skid Marks mom is working up a fart.  They do the fart song and we learned today that all the farts in the fart song are real farts.  Yeah, that were worked up either by Skid Marks or his mom. 
[25:30]
 Yeah.  So that's why they will not be performing that song live now in the N.A.W.  Studios.  Me and Anthony aren't that brave.  No, we heard Skid Marks your mom's farts and that's pretty dangerous.  I'm on the tape.  Wow.  Yeah, I hope you got a new microphone.  Yeah.  All right.  She blew the cat off the bed.  Now mom, are you drinking?  She blew the cat off the bed, huh?  What a messed up family you guys have. 
[26:00]
 What the hell goes on with the light go off in your house?  So mom, do you need to drink any soda?  What do you need?  Because we really want to hear one of those good, built it out farts today.  I'm just getting ready.  I don't need anything.  All right.  Shake it up a little bit.  I am mom's forty-three by the way.  I thought I was immature.  This is kind of fun.  At least, you know, you got some, you know, couple of years ahead of you that you could still be immature.  Yeah.  All right.  Now Skid Marks you've performed this song at Caroline's in the past. 
[26:30]
 Yes, I've performed this at Caroline's at the laugh wagon.  You know, an amateur night at like,  Gladys's Comedy Club.  Wow, you have more gigs than Andrew Dice Clay.  Yeah.  Good.  Wow.  Have you heard Dice on our show?  Actually, no, I haven't.  You didn't see him outside?  Oh, oh him?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The Dice Man.  All right.  Very good.  Now I hear when you do this song on stage that you actually dress up like a little girl. 
[27:00]
 Yeah, like really tough.  Oh my God.  That's so wrong.  I gotta tell people.  Candy to socks.  Candy to socks?  Mom, you allow your twelve-year-old kid to put panties on?  They're not really panties.  They're bloomers.  I rebuffed my pants and there's these little tiny like stockings sticking out.  Plumers and lace socks.  Mom.  Everything.  How old is he now?  Twelve.  Twelve.  Do you think a twelve-year-old boy should be wearing a... 
[27:30]
 It's very formative.  He's in his formative years here, Mom.  But there's the window of opportunity for female impersonators at his age.  Yeah, it's basically a transvestite.  Oh my God.  Do you know about transvestites, skid marks?  What's your definition of a transvestite?  Just out of curiosity.  A guy that dresses up like a lemon and makes men.  But I'm not the second part of that.  Oh, okay. 
[28:00]
 Very good.  You got a girlfriend or anything?  Nope.  No, not yet.  Would you like a girlfriend?  Do you have like an entourage or anything?  Do you have like groupies?  Are there skid mark groupies out there?  No.  Not yet.  Well, me and Anthony are your groupies.  We have your picture hanging up in our office, actually.  We do.  Any of the girls in school like you?  I don't think so.  No?  No, huh?  Because, you know, I spread the word around that I have skid marks.  That's where I got my name from.  Well, they're jealous that he dresses better than they do. 
[28:30]
 Skid marks.  So that's how you got the name?  Because you leave skid marks in your drawers.  Yeah, I have a reputation.  Yeah?  Mom, can you confirm that he has skid marks in his underwear there?  Confirmed.  Wow.  Very good.  Okay.  But he has holes in his underwear from far into mine.  You guys should get on stage together, I think, at this point.  No?  Okay.  So here we go.  We got skid marks and he's ready to perform his Titanic song and you're  going to do it as Shirley Temple. 
[29:00]
 Wait a minute.  What?  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Shh.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Shh.  Oh, haha.  Haha.  Oh my God.  Eventually.  That is so wrong.  That is so wrong.  You just got to be kidding me. 
[29:30]
 Anthony, describe what we just witnessed.  Well, skid marks mom.  Uh, just bent over, put the mic right there and let one loose.  It was.  The microphone's on the ground now.  That was a pretty good one.  Very nice.  Okay.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You know, I've seen some strange things in my radio career. 
[30:00]
 That's that goes right to the top.  That was even more entertaining than Anthony getting beat up by the  naked skank on that was that did the poetry a couple weeks ago.  He's got to sing and now he's choking.  All right.  Skid marks.  You got to compose yourself.  We're ready to do the Titanic song here.  All right.  Titanic song done by skid marks.  You're ready to go early.  Mark as Shirley Temple.  Here we go.  When the bad ship, the Titanic hit in iceberg. 
[30:30]
 So gigantic.  The captain said, boy golly, we're as good as dead.  The ship filled with water everywhere and SOS was radio throughout the air.  No rescue ships came through.  So all aboard it was to do.  There weren't enough lifeboats to keep everyone afloat. 
[31:00]
 Cause the big bad chief engineer, his in syncable with sunk.  He was nominated creep of the year.  Oh, the bad ship, the Titanic came to rest on the bottom of the Atlantic.  Many did the backstroke until they got really frozen and croaked. 
[31:30]
 This is the most screwed up family I've ever seen.  The maid.  All right.  We got, wait a minute.  What's the matter, Rick?  Thanks.  All right.  We got more with the skid marks and skid marks mom and more stupidity on the way.  If you want in on this, uh, this mess, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Fax is 212-957-WAW.  We got some Sheryl Crow and Kenny Wayne separate deck. 
[32:00]
 All right, Anthony.  I think it's worth a another listen.  I left lip here.  So here we go.  We got skid marks and he's ready to perform his Titanic song and you're going to do it as Shirley Temple.  Wait a minute.  What?  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  You got one.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  It's gonna get the way.  Wait, wait, wait.  43 year old lady. 
[32:30]
 1 0 2 7 W N E W the rock of New York, Sheryl Crow.  All I want to do is Sheryl Crow.  It's so pain Anthony.  Hey, uh, we got a ton of people on hold.  They want to play, uh, piss off a Texan.  I mean, Anthony are not very happy with the results today.  You know, people aren't getting it.  No, you, you gotta lay into them, but it takes some finesse.  Yeah.  It's like a fine boxer.  I think we'll give it one more shot in a little while. 
[33:00]
 All right.  But we got a, uh, pretty much wrap it up with skin mark here.  Did a great job for us today.  Skin Mark.  You did great.  Thanks.  And mom, you did great too.  Thank you.  I'll never forget the fart.  Thank you.  That was, uh, that was a good one.  Yeah.  Skin Mark was belting them out and so are you.  Good marks, uh, passed out some, what are those Altoids?  Yep.  Everybody.  Did it give you a mom too?  One free chance. 
[33:30]
 Well, I think we want to leave here with one last, uh, skid mark song.  Yeah.  Our little pal.  He'll be back though.  He's going to come up with some, uh, some new ditties for the show.  Hopefully skin mark in the future.  Yep.  Can we count on you for a song or two?  Sure.  Okay.  Well, very good.  Uh, here's the Charles Groton toupee song.  Actually, we got a lot of requests in the email for this song.  So here it is skin mark.  Check it out.  Charles Groton wears a funny little ratty ass to pay on his bald head. 
[34:00]
 And I can't determine if the dancing is either living or dead.  Maybe he should take it for a check up at the local SPCA.  Oh, I think that little wig with me in the worst way. 
[34:30]
 Very nice.  Kid marks.  And you could take this home with you a little facts from one of our faithful  listeners, a two little, um, picture of Shirley temple.  It says nice, nice song kid.  It's got a, a Shirley temple in front of, uh, the Titanic before it's  because we did learn that skid marks on stage in certain clubs, uh,  dresses as Shirley temple.  There you go.  Kid marks and mom, thanks for stopping by.  We appreciate it.  We'll have you back soon. 
[35:00]
 Thank you.  Skin marks likes his drawing.  Okay.  Very good.  One Oh two seven W N D W the rock of New York, the latest from creed off their  debut CD, my own prison.  That's the what's this life for city has gone double platinum for the boys from  Florida.  So if you have any hanging, I hope you're having fun listening.  Yeah, we're having fun.  And all we ask if we make you laugh and entertain you on the way home, you just  make us one of your presets.  We're noticing we're working our way up the preset.  That's why it's only but surely.  Um, we're also noticing that people are out there spreading the word about the 
[35:30]
 show.  We appreciate that too.  Thank you.  Cause we have noticed that, uh, we have very small faithful, um, audience that  enjoys the show.  Now we need to, uh, tell others.  Yes.  Cause it's frustrating for me and Anthony.  Uh, someone called yesterday and said, wow, I really like your show.  I'm like, cool.  How long have you been listening?  Um, two days, two days.  We've been busting our ass for three and a half months.  You know, you see this, um, Oprah thing. 
[36:00]
 Yeah.  I was just noticing that on the front page.  What do you think about that?  My, well, Michael Lewinsky was supposed to go on Oprah for the big, huge  exclusive interview.  Yeah.  Like so much meat.  They're just marketing Monica.  Now they got her handlers, whatever they are lawyers or whatever, and they're  just, now they're whoring her out again.  First it was bill had her as a, his whore and now the lawyers are whoring her out  to talk shows.  That's trying to turn a buck.  Honestly though, she does, you know, she deserves the buck.  It is America and people do this all the time. 
[36:30]
 Why not?  And if she could get a million dollars to tell her side of the story, exactly.  Why not?  Once again, you gotta, uh, hats off to the New York post with their headlines.  Yeah.  Monica blue talk deal.  Whenever they could work, work in the word blow blue sock, whatever they will also  a game.  Me and Anthony like to play every day.  We go through the New York papers and count how many pictures there are of  Monica with her mouth open.  Yeah.  You'll be surprised how many there are every day. 
[37:00]
 If you want to play along, but it amounts to the hundreds, you know, so  she's going to do this exclusive interview on someone show.  Obviously.  There's not much else to tell.  Right.  If you've read the star report, I mean, what else is there that she left out?  No, everyone just wants to hear her talk.  Yeah, that's true.  No one knows what she's no one knows what she sounds like.  That is very true.  That's the big thing.  I think Monica Lewinsky should go on a Rosie show.  You wouldn't be able to tell who is who exactly.  They look the same.  They got the same exact hairdo working. 
[37:30]
 You know what?  The, uh, the thing is though, Oprah is coming off now.  Like she's, uh, the, the clean squeaky clean talk show.  I'm not paying money.  I'm not doing it.  Cause I guess on yesterday's show, she announced that, um, you know, that  she has passed on the Monica Lewinsky interview and the audience just went nuts.  Like, you know, she's a messiah.  Yeah.  Well, the truth of the matter is, uh, it came down to who was going to have  rights to the videotape of her on the show.  Yeah.  Like her people wanted her to have rights to the videotape of her on Oprah 
[38:00]
 so it could be sold overseas or wherever.  Right.  Well, cause technically Oprah doesn't pay for interviews.  Right.  But Oprah makes an S load of money every time these, uh, high profile  celebrities come on her show.  Of course.  Of course.  You know, Oprah is, uh, acting all high and mighty, but you know what type  of ratings that would be an Oprah show would get with Monica Lewinsky and  ratings would mean lots and lots of ad dollars.  Yeah.  And she wanted, uh, exclusive rights to the videotape of the interview. 
[38:30]
 Yeah.  And then Oprah, uh, wasn't going to get that.  So she said, no, then forget it.  So she's not all that everyone's in it for a buck.  Of course.  Kidding.  So what show you think Monica is going to end up on?  I would love to see her on Jerry Springer, the opening show.  Yeah, that'd be cool.  Jerry, you think that would be a little bra?  Yeah.  Bring out a Hillary to bring out the whole family.  I don't know.  I think it's going to get to the point where really people really don't care. 
[39:00]
 Yeah.  No, she should go on to whatever the hell show she can get on now.  Cause in another few months, no one's going to care.  At all.  Uh, this story unfortunately has legs.  It's so weird.  I mean, doesn't Jay Leno have any other jokes?  I'm kind of embarrassed for him.  I was watching him last night.  Yeah.  Half his monologue is like the bill and Monica jokes still.  Yeah.  And like the obvious ones, cigar jokes and stuff.  It's like, it's so done.  It is done as far as making fun of it.  I mean, he's probably told a thousand jokes about Bill and Monica. 
[39:30]
 Yeah.  You know, you're supposed to be this, uh, great comedian.  Start talking about other stuff.  I can't think of anything else.  Bungle.  Well, the phones are ringing like crazy.  Everyone wants to play a piss off a Texan.  Um, I don't know.  We, we're not happy with the results yet though.  People don't really get the message in honor of the Yankees.  We are playing this lovely game where we call a random Texan, get you on the phone  with the Texan and you have 30 seconds to make them hang up.  Yes.  But you gotta be like witty.  You gotta have some chops about you.  Yeah.  And he can't curse. 
[40:00]
 Let's see what we can get happening here.  Hi, any W.  Hey, open Anthony.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up?  This is JT from Connecticut.  You want to piss off the Texan?  I could do it for you.  Well, people aren't doing a good job with this game.  I'll tell you what I got.  I got it for him.  All right.  We'll give you a shot.  All right, man.  All right.  Here it comes.  All right.  Here we go, brother.  Good luck.  Electrical maintenance.  Yes.  How you doing?  This is JT Roman suck from the daily item in Westchester, New York. 
[40:30]
 Oh, listen, I like to ask you about how you feel about the Texas Rangers tonight  against the New York Yankees.  How do I feel about them?  Yes, I do.  Oh, I don't know.  They have to snap ahead right now.  I guess I hope they win.  You hope they win.  Listen, between Gonzalez and Rodriguez, a bunch of Puerto Ricans inside the dugout  eating rice and beans.  How do you think they're going to beat the Yankees running a big fat box around the  bases farting all over the place?  Now you think they'll be able to touch our Yankees?  You know what?  Talk to me snap ahead right now. 
[41:00]
 There you go.  There you go.  That's how you do it.  Did it win?  Yeah, we'll give you a prize package.  That's not bad.  We're getting better at this.  Hold on the line.  All right, man.  Not bad.  Well, yeah, yeah, we'll play this for the rest of the week.  So, you know, you got to get really creative.  Yeah, kind of get throw some intelligence in there.  We'll think about it.  The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW collective soul little band from Stockbridge, Georgia.  That's December Sophie and Anthony having a lot of fun. 
[41:30]
 Once again today, I hope you're enjoying it wherever you're listening to us.  A lot of people making us preset one today because of skin marks mom farting.  You never know what's going to make people put us on their preset.  I don't even know what to say.  No, I was very amused to say the least.  Skid marks mom actually blasted one.  For how old was she? 
[42:00]
 42 43.  43 year old woman.  Yeah, her son, 12 year old son sitting here singing little songs.  Cute little song parodies about tragedy.  Yes.  Actually, he was ready to start his song.  Yeah.  And she went, oh, wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait bent over.  Put her butt against the mic and let loose.  It was a Fellini scene.  You know what?  I think we gained more listeners from that than anything else we've done lately. 
[42:30]
 I think we gained more listeners than the than turned off listeners.  Wow.  Really?  Okay.  Maybe the tide is changing for us a little bit.  Getting a few calls on the page plant live concert.  We're doing tomorrow night.  That's exclusively here on any W it's happening from New Orleans and it will be  getting underway at 1030 tomorrow night.  All right, because people have been asking about that.  Also people asking for the road rage bit from yesterday.  Yes, a bit.  I must say the boss did not like.  Yeah, there's a couple of those.  The boss doesn't like so we're going against him here and we're going to play it. 
[43:00]
 We're going to use our we don't care.  The boss didn't like it card.  He pulled that one out pretty much.  All right.  I think he gets influenced by two or three, you know, complaint calls and then  yeah, you people that complain shut up.  Yeah, because you're confusing our show.  You're wrecking maybe tomorrow.  You know, you can flood our boss Gary with you know, happy calls.  I love the road rage bit.  Yeah, just over and over again.  Just call him all day long.  You'll get through. 
[43:30]
 Everyone gets through to the boss.  His name is Gary.  Yeah, and just say I love the road rage bit.  There you go and just all day long call him.  I'm serious because if he's in a good mood, then he doesn't yell at us as much before  the show when they say he didn't like the profanity.  There was a lot of profanity used.  Yeah, he thought it wasn't a high brow enough.  But you know something problem is this is a taste of reality.  It's not like we're writing a script.  This is what people do when they're on the roadway.  Yeah, ask my wife if I don't yell like that.  Yeah, when I have road rage. 
[44:00]
 Yeah, I think I didn't curse enough.  That's usually I'm cursing a lot more.  I think we're giving our listeners a little insight on you know, what goes on when we're  not here in the studio 1027 WNEW the Rock of New York Brian Adams and the latest from  Lenny Kravitz before that fly away.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey having an absolute riot today.  Hope you're enjoying it.  Everyone wants to hear skid marks mom farting again.  So I think we'll end the show with that.  Yeah, that was a special moment in a few minutes.  We'll do that just before seven just before Matt Devotee takes over. 
[44:30]
 What the hell is going on in the skid house?  The skidsters house.  I like his part song too.  Yeah, that was pretty pretty funny.  Maybe we'll end with that and then and with his mom farting.  That could be fun.  Are you good wrap up?  Yeah, it will be on this New Year, right?  What is it a new year?  It's the new fiscal year.  Don't we have to blow into like one of those big?  What the the chauffeur?  Yeah, that's the other holiday, isn't it? 
[45:00]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  We don't have any Jewish people here because they're all home for the holiday  and I don't think any Jewish people are allowed to listen to us.  So I mean we want to know what you have to blow on this holiday.  I think that's Rosh Hashanah Rosh Hashanah you get a big like corn thing out.  Yeah.  And what is this Yom Kippur Yom Kippur?  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, oh, there's a funny story in the Daily News today really fast.  I think a lot of us could relate to this from our dangerous days. 
[45:30]
 A statue of the baby Jesus stolen from a church in Eastport two years ago was  turned into a bong.  A water pipe used to smoke marijuana.  Suffolk police said oh really that's what a bong is.  Thank you for telling me.  They got to tell you isn't that amazing.  I guess they stole this like little statues little shrine in front of the church  and these kids turned it into a bong.  Very creative.  So the smoking dope out of Jesus's head.  That's the baby Jesus dude. 
[46:00]
 And then after they smoke it they do see God.  So you have to be creative.  I remember when I was smoking the marijuana cigarettes.  Oh, P.  Anthony doesn't smoke anymore.  I don't I don't and I don't either by the way.  I remember though, you know, you can make it out of an apple.  Yeah, you know, you would put it take a big thing out of the apple and then put  a pencil through it.  Or a pen and smoke it out of an apple.  Who would have thought of that?  I smoked it out of a carrot once a carrot and I smoked it out of a wiffle ball bat. 
[46:30]
 That was kind of a wiffle ball bat.  It's kind of hard but just figure it out.  It has that tiny little hole at the bottom of the bat.  Oh, so you just cut a hole at the other end.  Yeah, and then with like some tin foil.  Yeah, exactly.  In the hole.  There you go.  That was the most creative we got when we were growing up.  Yeah, my brother was always smoking weed.  Back when we were younger and he couldn't have any smoking paraphernalia around the  house because then you know mom would know so he would take like a cigarette pack cut 
[47:00]
 a hole in it put some tin foil poke some holes and smoke it out of that and then leave  that laying around.  Might as well just leave a six-foot bong in the living room.  Well, your mom was kind of close when it came to drugs in your household.  Let's face it Anthony.  That's true.  She didn't know was raising pod plants in the backyard 12 feet high and 12 foot high  pot plants in the backyard and he convinced her it was basal and oregano hybrid.  And so I don't think your mom would have figured out that cigarette pack trick.  I think this is after she started like smoking pot. 
[47:30]
 Your mom smoked pot.  Oh, yeah, kiddin.  Really?  Oh, yeah, back in the you know mid 70s mid to late 70s pot coke.  Who knows what she was up to.  I wonder if my mom ever smoked dope.  She went through that phase, you know after pop left went to California and then she had  to take care of the kids and then she just exploded and said, you know something I'm  having fun and she crammed about 20 years of fun into about four or five years.  Wow. 
[48:00]
 Yeah, that's pretty bizarre.  I met your mom.  I can't imagine her token.  Uh, it's pretty awful for us kids for a while.  That's Joe.  That's Joe.  How he woke up one night, you know, leave the scar when you're in your bedroom sleep  and you hear from your mom's room.  Oh, get out of here.  I'm not kidding.  Your brother heard your mom having sex.  Yeah with who who knows I'm not lying.  He banged on the wall. 
[48:30]
 Like you want to hear that, you know, pretty inconsiderate mom get a room.  Are you serious?  Yeah, this is back in the 70s.  What do I know?  Well, no, I never heard my parents doing it.  You didn't know that would horrify me.  Yeah.  I never heard it, but I just heard Joe banging on the wall.  Really?  Oh, good old.  God, what a tragic child that you had.  Yeah.  The dad that used to pick you up in his little red sports coat.  Now he was in a sports sports car. 
[49:00]
 Sorry.  Now he booked out to California.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And mom, I remember mom bringing home member for the mess.  Your mom brought.  Yeah.  And he couldn't one night.  Could he?  He couldn't one night because it was cut and and and mom's like, oh yeah,  cut it.  Razor blade doing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're gonna get sued for saying this on the air. 
[49:30]
 Yeah.  Let him come forward.  Mom will testify right now.  I noticed something Anthony.  You surprisingly look a lot like Felix.  Beyond.  One oh two seven W.  Any W.  The rag of New York.  Johnny Lang lied to me.  It's hoping Anthony just about out the dope.  Yeah.  Got to thank skid marks for coming in with his mom today.  That was some scene.  Yeah.  He was the star of the show today without a doubt.  Yeah.  Matter of fact, I got his I like to fart song. 
[50:00]
 All right.  We'd like to end our show from time to time with fart humor.  Yes.  Because fart equals funny bring it up a notch.  Yeah.  Well skid marks.  He's 12 years old.  He does song parodies some very creative ones and then he has this one which is I'd like to fart and he came in to perform some of these songs live for us.  But we found out thank God in time that the parts you're about to hear in this song are actually real farts.  Yeah, that he and his mom did they ate a bunch of chili right and put a bag over the microphone. 
[50:30]
 Yeah.  Why I don't even want to know.  And then when one came out they recorded it.  Yes.  And put it in the song and we found out that the really loud parts are skid marks moms.  Well the size would have to resonate.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's 43 farting helping her kid do this song.  Yes.  And then the little cute little tiny little mouse farts are good marks.  So check this out.  I got a song for you. 
[51:00]
 Anyone out there want to pull my finger?  I like to fart.  I'm a master of this art.  I pass a lot of air through my derriere.  No one can surpass.  My skill of passing gas.  My technique of ripping farts is highly state of mind. 
[51:30]
 That's the mom.  So all right.  So then they came in and skid marks was ready to perform his Titanic song right.  Anthony.  Yes.  And they were live right there to our left and we had been coaxing his mom to belt one 
[52:00]
 out when we found out she actually did backup backup fucked.  Yeah.  On the fart song.  Yeah.  And she sat there for a while and then right before skid marks was ready to do his Titanic  song she went oh wait. </pre>
