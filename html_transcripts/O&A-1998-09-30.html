<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, debating the baseball playoffs, with Opie switching his allegiance to the Yankees after the Mets' disappointing season.  They then launched into a segment called "Piss Off a Texan," a game where callers attempted to make a Texan hang up within 30 seconds using only non-threatening, non-curse-word insults. The prize was Opie and Anthony merchandise.  A listener, Inez, was mentioned for having the show set as preset #1 in her car, despite her boss's disapproval, highlighting a previous "road rage" segment.

Next, the show welcomed 12-year-old aspiring comedian Skidmarks and his mother to the studio. Skidmarks was known for his song parodies, including a previously recorded "fart song" featuring actual farts captured after a chili-eating session.  While the fart song wasn’t played live due to its…unique nature, the show did play his song "I Like to Fart," with Skidmarks providing commentary on each individual fart.  Multiple rounds of "Piss Off a Texan" filled the airwaves with callers employing increasingly creative (and often insulting) strategies against Texan listeners.

Between "Piss Off a Texan" segments, Skidmarks performed several of his songs live, including a "Monica" (Chelsea Clinton) parody and a "Titanic" parody.  A memorable moment occurred when Skidmarks’ mother let out a loud fart into a microphone while building up to the “Titanic” song.  He also performed his "Charles Grodin Toupee" song.  The broadcast concluded with further discussion of Skidmarks’ mother’s impressive flatulence, additional "Piss Off a Texan" calls, and  banter surrounding the Monica Lewinsky scandal and its media coverage.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  Just got a Red Sox score.  The Indians are leading the Red Sox 7-3 in the sixth inning.  Playoff baseball is here.  Yankees looked great yesterday.  I have officially jumped on the Yankee bandwagon.  Well, you know, you have to.  Your little Mets choked out.  But I think that's what you've got to do when you're in New York.  You either like the Mets or the Yankees.  And then when your team's out of it, I hope most people jump on board and support the team.  That's all.  Yeah.  I would have loved to see the Mets in the playoffs, but they had the big choke, as we all know. 
[00:00:30]  So, David Wells.  Man.  Great game.  Is he a scary pitcher or what?  It's great.  The Mets are a scary, the Yankees are a scary team.  Yeah.  I'd love it.  I just want to see the Yankees play the Red Sox, actually.  That'll be fun.  That's always fun.  A lot of fun, actually.  Hey, you want to play Piss Off a Texan today?  I think it's appropriate. 
[00:01:00]  Do we have any prizes that we could give away if we play our fine game Piss Off a Texan in honor of the Yankees playing the Rangers?  If we have to go out and pillage offices for prizes, we will find something.  All right.  That we can give away.  I think we have some of our lovely Opie and Anthony t-shirts laid around the joint.  Really?  Yeah, with our baby pictures.  I don't know.  Wow.  Good for dining or disco desk and den.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Well, I guess we've got to figure out if we've got prizes. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  We've got a fine game we'd love to play this afternoon.  Yeah, this is good because the Texas Rangers play the Yankees.  Mm-hmm.  And we all want them to lose.  Yes.  So let's, yeah, Piss Off a Texan.  Well, you've got to have bullies because basically what we do is we get you on the line with  a random Texan and you've got 30 seconds to make them hang up without telling them to  hang up.  Yeah.  You can't curse them out.  You've just got to be very creative in your wording and your words to make this person hang 
[00:02:00]  up in 30 seconds.  Yeah.  You can't threaten them.  No.  You know, like, oh, I'm going to kill you.  You've got to just tick them off with your humor, your intelligence.  Your wit.  Your wit.  That's it.  Without cursing.  And if we had a good prize, we'll give the people a prize if they could accomplish that.  Let's dig up some prizes and play.  All right.  We'll dig up some prizes and we will do that.  Also, 212-757-1027 if you got something today.  The fax line, 212-957-WNEW.  It's very interesting getting lots of faxes. 
[00:02:30]  People are making us part of their preset in the car and we thank you for that.  Thank you.  Here's a person, what's her name?  Inez.  Just made us preset number one on the car.  Well, thank you.  And the reason?  Because he loved the road rage bit yesterday we did on our show.  Really?  That's interesting, Inez, because the boss didn't like that one.  Isn't that weird?  So we gained the listener for doing a bit.  The boss hated.  All right.  That's good.  All right.  What do you got for the instant feedback, Ed? 
[00:03:00]  WNEW.com.  Click on our pictures and you could instantly email us here in the studio.  Very good.  On the way, we got the latest from Johnny Lang and Derek and the Dominoes if you stay right  where you are.  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York, Robert Plant.  I haven't heard that song in a while, In the Mood.  And don't forget Robert Plant with his buddy Paige, Thursday night right here on NEW Live  Broadcast from New Orleans.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  So you met Skidmarks?  He's out in the lobby?  Skidmarks is out there in the lobby with his mom. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Fun kid.  He wants to be a stand-up comic.  I guess he performs at Caroline's, we have found out.  Performs all over.  Yeah.  He's 11 years old or is he 12?  12.  Okay.  Right here.  He's done all the goofy songs we've heard on the radio in the last couple days.  We heard some disturbing news about his fart song.  I guess we've got to get him in here to explain all this.  Yeah.  Yeah, we should do that.  We will.  Okay.  Him and his mom, they're quite a team out there. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  So.  She writes all the music?  Or performs the music, I guess.  Performs the music, yeah.  And he does his own writing?  Yeah.  I'm just in shock over what I heard about the fart song.  All right.  That'll be a good tease.  Stick around to hear Skidmarks talk about his fart song.  It's pretty amazing, actually.  And are we going to play Piss Off a Texan today?  I want to do that.  All right.  Boss, do we have any prizes?  Do we have anything we can give away? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, do we want.  Really?  Anything we can...  Can we give away a car today?  Sure.  What do you have in mind?  Yeah, whose car?  Whose car?  Like Scott Muni's car or something?  Can we give that away?  Yeah.  That's a Model C.  Don't give that away.  You've got to have someone to hook it up while he's on the air, though.  Yeah.  That wouldn't be too hard.  Do we have prizes?  Because we want to play this fun little game.  Absolutely.  Well, we have the listeners.  Piss Off Texans.  Well, what could it be?  We, you know, we need some incentive.  Do we have like a Cajugoo Goo Goo CD or something we could give them?  The Cajugoo Goo Goo Box Set.  Cajugoo Goo Box Set.  Right. 
[00:05:00]  The Box Set.  Vanilli we have.  Vanilli, Vanilli, great.  Do we have any prizes here at this point?  We have T-shirts.  We have the Opie and Anthony T-shirts, right?  The Opie and Anthony, right.  See, that's, look, the phones aren't ringing for that.  They don't want something better than that.  Yeah, they need something better than an Opie and Anthony T-shirt.  Yeah.  I wouldn't even wear an Opie and Anthony T-shirt at this point.  Okay, so you don't want music.  Well, we want good music.  Okay, good music.  Yeah, put together like a CD package or something.  Yeah, what would you like?  Like, who would you like?  John Mellencamp.  We could do that.  Who else?  Brian Setzer's cool. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Brian Setzer's done.  Okay.  Who else?  That means you have to bring yours back in from home.  Can you remember tomorrow?  Yeah.  Johnny Lang.  Wrap it up in a sandwich bag.  Slightly used.  I saw some Johnny Langs back there in Andrew's office.  So we could, like, put some CD packages together and an Opie and Anthony T-shirt.  All right.  All right, we'll do that.  Should we get calls for this festival?  Yes, right now.  So we're going to do it. 
[00:06:00]  Yes.  Pissed off a Texan.  You've got to have bullies.  You've got to be brave.  Quick on your feet, too.  Quick on your feet.  You've got to get a Texan to hang up in 30 seconds.  Yeah.  Without cursing them out.  You can't use any profanity.  You've got to use your intellect, your wit, your humor.  Can't threaten them.  Can't threaten them.  You can't tell them to hang up.  You can't tell them you're part of a radio contest.  And you have to talk.  You can't just sit there silent.  Yes.  And we'll conference you with a live, breathing Texan.  And you've got 30 seconds to get them to hang up.  And if you accomplish that, we'll give you this lovely Opie and Anthony prize package. 
[00:06:30]  Look at the phones now.  Look at the phones now.  See?  There you go.  I like that.  I think it was the Johnny Lang CD that turned everyone on.  All right.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony on the way.  We've got some great rock and roll, some ZZ Top.  Also, Split End is a song you haven't heard in a while.  And look who has made his way into the NEW studios.  It's Skidmarks.  He's becoming a cult figure on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, it is Skidmarks.  How are you, bro?  Good. 
[00:07:00]  And you?  Pretty good.  The listeners love you.  Oh, really?  And is that your mom over there?  Yes, that's my mom.  Pull up a mic there, Mom.  And what's your name?  Mrs. Marks?  Mrs. Marks.  Mrs. Marks.  So you guys are going to sing some songs today?  Actually, Skidmarks will be performing today for us?  Yes, I am.  Okay.  Skidmarks gave us a tape of some of his ditties that we played on our show yesterday.  You might remember Skidmarks from Friday's show where he called in with the Monica song. 
[00:07:30]  Very good.  You wrote that?  Yes, I did, actually.  And what does Mom play?  The piano?  No, that's a recording of a no-song Gary, Indiana.  Right.  Yeah, and then we got the part where there's no words, and then that's where I did the song.  Very good.  You know how many people had that song stuck in their head this weekend because of you, Skidmarks?  A catchy ditty.  Yeah.  I must say.  So then we found out that Skidmarks has done other song parodies, so he sends a FedEx package yesterday with a couple of them.  Yeah.  And a lot of people liked your I Like to Fart song, Skidmarks. 
[00:08:00]  That's pretty funny.  And we just found out some disturbing news about this song.  Right, Mom?  Kind of.  Now, I thought those fart noises in I Like to Fart were made with, like, your mouth.  You know how you just, like that?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course you do.  You're 12.  Of course you know how to make fart noises.  But I find out that they were real.  Yeah, we ate three whole cans of chili the night before. 
[00:08:30]  You and Mom?  Mm-hmm.  And then when we were sleeping, we were like, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I got one.  I got one.  And then we run over to the microphone and record it.  We got the best ones and recorded them on it.  Wait a minute.  Did you record your mom's farts at this point, too?  Uh-huh.  A touching family moment.  So, Mom, did some of your farts make it into the actual song?  Yes, they did.  A family that farts together stays together.  Wow.  Don't tell me.  Yours was the more bassy one. 
[00:09:00]  Mine were the sweet, quiet ones.  No.  Yours was the loud ones, like horns.  Yeah.  Hey, Mom, how old are you?  Don't have to tell.  43.  43, and you're farting with your kid.  I kind of like that, actually.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  I think I'm going to go home and fart with my parents.  I'm going to bond with them in that way.  Family value.  So, thankfully, after we found out that the farts in I Like to Fart are actually real, 
[00:09:30]  we have decided not to allow Skid Marks to perform that song live on the show today.  No, not until we get more adequate ventilation here in the studio.  Yes, but what we're going to do is we'll play Skid Marks, I Like to Fart here.  Okay.  So, check it out in case you missed it yesterday, and just keep in mind these farts are real.  I got a song for you.  Anyone out there want to pull my finger?  I like to fart.  I'm a master of this art. 
[00:10:00]  I pass a lot of air through my derriere.  No one can surpass my skill of passing gas.  My technique of ripping farts is highly state of art.  Oh, that last one. 
[00:10:30]  Whose was that?  Mom.  That was yours, Mom?  I confess.  Oh, man.  How about that?  What the heck is going on here?  That night.  Why are you turning red, Mom?  I hope she's not trying to force one out.  Yeah, don't get so embarrassed that you'll let one sneak through, man.  All right.  Skid Marks is sitting there while the song is playing and pointing out who did each individual fart. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, each fart he'd point to either himself or his mom.  And I must say, all the loud ones in that song came from Mom.  All right, great.  So, Skid Marks is going to hang out with us a little bit today.  You're going to do a tune for us.  You're going to do the Monica song, the Phil and Monica song.  Now, you actually perform at nightclubs?  Yeah, I do.  A bunch of song parodies that I perform at Caroline's.  Look at this kid.  Me and Anthony can't even get in on stage at Caroline's. 
[00:11:30]  How did you figure that one out?  All right.  Very good.  Wow.  A talented kid.  We'll explain his Titanic song and the Monica song.  He's going to stick around for a while.  Yep.  Also, on the way next, we're going to play a round of Piss Off a Texan.  Yeah.  Yanks are going to sweep the ranges.  Everybody knows it.  So, it's time to just...  Mess with the Texans a little bit.  Mess with Texas.  We got some fine prizes, and we'll do that next.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW with the Wallflowers. 
[00:12:00]  Split ends before that.  I got you.  It's Opie and Anthony hanging today with Skid Marks and his lovely mother.  They have come down to perform a few of their ditties.  Mrs. Marks.  Mrs. Marks in the studio.  We found out she could fart louder than her son.  She did the backup farting on the fart song.  Yes.  And the Monica song is on the way, and that's what turned us on to Skid Marks, if you were  listening last Friday.  And I think we're even going to put Skid Marks in the imaginary ballroom.  We only, you know, put special people in the imaginary ballroom, Skid Marks. 
[00:12:30]  For his live performance.  Yeah, we're going to put you in there so you can perform the Monica song.  And that's going to happen the next time we talk.  But right now, we've got to play Piss Off a Texan.  Well, David Wells, I think, pissed off a Texan a bunch of Texans last night, huh?  Yeah, he looked great.  Yankees look great, obviously.  So now it's your turn to piss off a Texan.  Yeah, we've got a guy, Ed, on the line who's going to attempt this game.  It's real simple.  We call up a random Texan.  You're on the phone line.  We conference you.  You can't curse at the guy. 
[00:13:00]  You can't tell him it's part of a radio promotion or whatever.  And you've got 30 seconds to make the guy hang up.  30, huh?  Yeah.  Well, if it's good, we'll give him leeway, you know?  All right.  We're not going to, like, stop the thing after 30 seconds.  Yeah.  I mean, if they're getting into some good battles, we've got to let it go.  We'll be the sole judge.  Yeah, pretty much.  You do a good job pissing them off.  We'll give you this fine Opie and Anthony prize package.  Which is a Opie and Anthony t-shirt and some CDs.  That's all we can muster up around here.  Yeah, for now. 
[00:13:30]  We're growing every day, though.  Lots of positive email, you know, last night.  Got to bring in our own CDs to give away.  Pretty much.  But here we go.  Let's get Ed on the line here.  Ed, do you want to play Piss Off a Texan?  Yeah, why not?  All right.  You know what you're going to do?  Pretty much.  You've got 30 seconds.  You can't tell him you're part of a radio thing.  And you can't curse at him.  Okay.  Can I say something about his family and stuff?  Yeah.  You are.  Piss him off.  It's Piss Off a Texan.  Okay.  Speak out, Betty.  Here he comes. 
[00:14:00]  Texas fly with this Kenny.  Hey, Kenny.  Yes, sir.  This is Mr. Hill.  Yes, sir.  Are you the rootin' this, tootin' this, straight-shootin' this Texan this side of the Pesos?  Is this Boomhauer?  Not Boomhauer, you dummy.  Hey, how much are the Rangers going to lose by today?  No, the Rangers take them the next three.  They got David Wells out of the way.  Give me a break.  Uh-uh.  Are you married?  Yes, sir.  I heard you go to family reunions to pick up women.  You big imbecile.  So the easiest women in this country are in my family. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, I bet.  Probably your mom and your sister and everybody else.  You wear one of them stupid ten-gallon hats?  Yes, sir.  How big's your mom?  She's huge.  She's huge?  Yeah, like she's about 500 pounds.  Hey, if I kicked your sister in the mouth, would you be circumcised?  You don't get that, huh?  You don't get that one, do you?  I hate Texas.  And you.  Eddie! 
[00:15:00]  Yo!  Great job, man!  Did I work it out?  Yeah, we're going to give you a prize for that.  You know it!  He hung up in there somewhere.  Hold on the line, brother.  All right.  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York with the Goo Goo Dolls.  That's their latest slide off.  Dizzy up the girl.  It's Sophie and Anthony.  Earl just entered the studio and he's scared because Skidmark's mom asked him if she could,  you know, fart on his hand.  Earl, come on.  Take one for the team.  I don't think she could work one up that fast, could you? 
[00:15:30]  Whoa, she's shaking her head, guys.  Wait, Skidmark's mom wants to fart?  Can you work one up or what?  I'll let you know when I'm ready.  What a mess.  There must be a ball at the PTA.  Yeah, Skidmark's mom.  I'm saving it for Earl.  Wow.  Earl, I got a girlfriend, Earl.  Get over there.  Come on.  We'll make something happen for you.  No.  No?  All right.  That's your mom, Skidmark's.  Are you proud of her? 
[00:16:00]  Yes, sir.  You didn't know how to answer that.  Going in the family.  Yeah.  Did she go to school with you and stuff, like for the parent-teacher thing?  No, and I don't want her to.  I don't blame you.  All right.  She might fart, and that would ruin your school career.  Yeah.  Got it.  And they put F on my report cards for farting.  There you go.  So, Skidmark's mom, you know, we'd really like you to fart, so if you got one, just raise  your hand, and we'll let you, you know.  Okay.  We'll step aside and allow you the privilege of farting. 
[00:16:30]  I think you'll be the first one to fart in here.  Yeah.  Because Anthony doesn't let me fart anymore.  No.  He did it once, and I ran out of the studio.  I had to run.  It was not fun.  So, if you don't know who Skidmark's is, he's our new pal.  We feel honored that he has stopped by the NEW studios.  He sang a little Monica.  Actually, I keep saying Monica, but it's a song about Monica and Bill.  It's actually the Chelsea Clinton song.  Yeah.  He did it Friday, and you got a couple emails on that, right? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  People love it.  Yeah.  He said they were having a bad day, and they heard the song, and it, like, made them happy.  Yes.  Until it got stuck in their head for three days straight.  Right.  Then they wanted to hit themselves with a lump hammer.  Yeah.  Now they want to sit on you, Skidmark's, and fart on your face.  Oh, Jesus.  So, Skidmark's has a bunch of goofy little songs.  We played his fart song earlier.  Yeah.  We're going to do the Chelsea song here.  And we got a couple other ditties, you know, we'll throw on throughout the show.  He's going to perform this one live.  Yep.  That's cool. 
[00:17:30]  And then we'll get into the Titanic song and the Charles Grodin hairpiece song, which  is my favorite, actually, Skidmark's.  Yeah.  Make sure his music's up real loud.  Okay.  All right.  Your music is ready to go, and Skidmark's whenever you're ready.  All right?  Okie dokie.  Take it, brother.  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy crying and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  Mama reads the papers all about my daddy's capers, and she calls him a husty-loving man. 
[00:18:00]  If you'd like to have a little explanation about what I heard during the latest conversation,  I will say without some moments of hesitation.  Oh, Mama did one shout.  Bro, get out, get out.  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lion and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  His Christian values have gone to hell these days.  Now, he's a God-fearing, husty-loving man. 
[00:18:30]  If you'd like to have a little explanation about what I heard during the latest conversation,  I will say without some moments of hesitation.  Oh, Mama did one shout.  Bro, get out, get out.  Mama keeps on crying all about my daddy's lion and the way he cheated on her with Monica.  Mama reads the papers all about my daddy's capers, and she calls him a husty-loving man. 
[00:19:00]  Woo!  Come on, guys.  All right.  Get out.  Do it live.  Great job.  You guys are kidding me.  Do you do radio?  We need some DJs around here.  Yeah.  I think the boss will hire you to do a show here at this point.  Actually, if he got on the air staff, that would make the average age of the air staff here 86.  It would actually bring it way down.  Very nice.  Well, Skid Marks is hanging with us today.  We'll do the Titanic song in a little while and some other ditties. 
[00:19:30]  Great job, Skid Marks.  And Mom, how's that fart coming?  It's coming.  It's coming.  And stick around for the finale.  Skid Marks' mom will be farting.  What a mess we got going on here today, Anthony.  We love it.  1027 WNEW, the Iraq of New York with the latest from whole that celebrity skin.  I like that song a lot, but who cares?  Actually, the CD's getting great reviews.  Yes, it is.  And I haven't tracked through it yet.  I'm surprised by myself because I like Courtney Love and I want to check it out. 
[00:20:00]  Tracked through it, huh?  Yeah.  That's a DJ lingo.  Yeah, I've got to track through it, decide which songs are good and which songs aren't  that great.  Yeah.  It's cool to talk like that, Anthony.  Oh, I didn't realize.  I'm sorry.  Hey, could every day be a Jewish holiday, please?  I love the traffic.  Could we officially make it, you know, Jewish holidays every day of the year?  The traffic was non-existent driving in.  Absolutely non-existent.  We cut, what, 50% off our time?  Yes.  It was awesome.  Fax is coming in. 
[00:20:30]  Foot writes, Skidmarks is a god.  Get me his autograph and get Mom's autograph, too.  All right.  Look at that.  You got fans, Skidmarks.  He's warming up for his Titanic song, which we're going to do in a little while.  And Mom is warming up to fart.  Right, Mom?  She's working it.  You're working it?  Can we help you along?  Is there any foods you need or maybe some hot chocolate or something?  Lactitude.  Lactitude.  Some ex-lax.  Yeah.  Skidmarks, what type of food does Mom need to fart really well? 
[00:21:00]  I think she needs junk food.  Yeah?  Yeah?  What's her favorite junk food?  Because we got tons of faithful listeners.  They'll run some junk food up here for the pleasure of seeing Skidmarks Mom fart.  Maybe I could just, like, swallow, like, a fizzy hole or something like that.  Like an Alka-Seltz or something.  Yeah?  Wow.  All right.  You're not going to let us down, though.  You're going to fart before the end of the show, right?  I swear.  Just sit there and simmer.  All right.  Yeah, just hang out.  We'll get to you in a little bit.  We also have another guy on the line who wants to play Piss Off a Texan.  All right.  Now, we're going to do this game, you know, for the rest of the week until the, you know, 
[00:21:30]  the Yankees sweep the Rangers.  Yes.  And we want them to get better.  Simple as that.  The first guy that did it, he was pretty good.  Yeah.  But we need some really creative, witty people out there.  The game is simple.  We put you on the line with a random Texan.  You've got 30 seconds to make them hang up.  Angry.  Right.  You've got to be angry.  Right.  That's all.  And you can't curse.  You can't tell them it's part of a radio program.  You know?  And what you've got to do is you've got to get creative with your baseball knowledge 
[00:22:00]  and your baseball abuse, and you have to have some good, like, mama jokes and stuff  and put downs.  Better get skid marks to do one.  Yeah.  I bet he could piss off a Texan.  He probably could.  All right.  Let's talk to Kyle here.  Kyle, you want to play Piss Off a Texan?  Of course.  All right.  You've got 30 seconds to make this random Texan hang up the phone, and you can't curse  at him, and you can't tell him you're on the radio.  All righty.  Anything else goes.  You can do mama abuse, whatever it takes.  All righty.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Thanks. 
[00:22:30]  Make sure you speak up.  All right, brother.  All righty.  Here it comes.  Show in.  This is Wendy.  Can you help me?  Yeah.  Hi.  This is Kyle from the New York Daily News.  Uh-huh.  I'd like to know what you think about the New York Yankees, how they're going to kick  the Rangers' ass tonight.  Don't say that, man.  Oh, hell no.  Long and Ziles ain't going to do nothing.  Just wait until you see Andy Pettit's splitter go right off Will Clark's nose, huh?  This is Steve.  Hello.  Yeah.  Yeah, hi.  This is Kyle from the New York Daily News. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  Yeah, we'd like to know what you think about the New York Yankees.  I think they're a bunch of Yankee chumps, man.  Get the hell out of here.  Texas Rangers are going to get killed tonight.  Andy Pettit is going to take that sinker and throw it all over the place.  He couldn't carry Helling's job.  Get the hell out of here.  Juan Gonzalez, 0 for freaking 3?  Not to mention that.  He smelled my nutsack.  He's not.  Get out.  No.  You know what I think.  Go walk on your 10-gallon hat, okay?  Why don't you eat some beef jerky while you're at it? 
[00:23:30]  Freaking Texas can't do anything to New York here.  New York, baby.  Number one.  Going all the way.  Ain't got nothing to say, huh?  I think he hung up.  All right.  I do believe we have a winner.  All right.  Congratulations, Kyle.  Thank you.  Not bad.  You got a little nervous when you heard the guy answer.  Yeah, it screwed me up because, I mean, you gave me two people.  There you go.  You had to go through two of them for the O.P.  and Anthony Price Packers.  Hold on the line, all right?  All right, thanks.  I know we can do better than what Kyle just did. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, well, he was very knowledgeable on his baseball.  Yeah.  You know, he was throwing that at him pretty good.  But we're looking for anger.  Looking for anger and we're looking for a little sparring, too.  You've got to allow the other guy to get in a little bit.  We want the people in Texas to hang up and feel bad for the rest of the day.  Yeah.  That you insulted them so badly.  Of course we do.  That's what we need.  We're New Yorkers, for Christ's sake.  We can do a better job than that.  All right, we'll put together another prize package.  Yeah, we'll give it one more try. 
[00:24:30]  We're going to do this throughout the week, so.  We've got some CDs and t-shirts.  We're looking for the witty, you know, some wit to you.  You know what I mean?  Make the Texan hang up and go, well, what in the hell happened to me?  What the hell was that?  Holy Jesus, El Amino.  There you go.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, with Kiss Rock and Roll All Night Party every day.  It's Opie and Anthony and Skid Marks and Skid Marks' mom.  If you're just tuning in to the show, our new pal Skid Marks has stopped by for a little visit. 
[00:25:00]  We enjoyed his Chelsea Clinton song, so we decided to have him in.  Yeah, last Friday, that was.  Yeah, and he's got a few ditties that he wanted to sing for everyone today.  He's got a Titanic song.  Yeah, I think that's the one we're going to do now.  All right.  And also, if you stick around, we've got a little treat for you guys today.  Skid Marks' mom is working up a fart.  Well, they do the fart song, and we learned today that all the farts in the fart song are real farts.  Yeah.  That were worked up either by Skid Marks or his mom. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, so that's why they will not be performing that song live in the NAW studios.  Me and Anthony aren't that brave.  No.  Because we heard Skid Marks, your mom's farts, and that's pretty dangerous on the tape.  Wow.  Yeah, I hope you got a new microphone.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  All right.  She blew the cat off the bed.  Now, Mom, are you drinking?  She blew the cat off the bed, huh?  Uh-huh.  What a messed up family you guys have. 
[00:26:00]  What the hell goes on when the lights go off in your house?  All right.  So, Mom, do you need to drink any soda?  What do you need?  Because we really want to hear one of those good, built-it-out farts today.  I'm just getting ready.  I don't need anything.  All right.  Shake it up a little bit.  I am.  Mom's 43, by the way.  I thought I was immature.  This is kind of fun.  At least you know you got some, you know, a couple of years ahead of you that you can  still be immature.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, Skid Marks, you've performed this song at Caroline's in the past? 
[00:26:30]  Yes, I've performed this at Caroline's, at the Laugh Wagon, on amateur nights at, like,  Gladys' Comedy Club.  Wow, you have more gigs than Andrew Dice Clay.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  Wow.  Have you heard Dice on our show?  Actually, no, I haven't.  You didn't see him outside?  Oh, oh, him?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm the Diceman, huh?  All right, very good.  Now, I hear when you do this song on stage that you actually dress up like a little girl. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, it might truly tell me.  Oh, my God.  That's so wrong.  I got to tell people.  I can't eat the socks.  I can't eat the socks?  Mom, you allow your 12-year-old kid to put panties on?  They're not really panties.  They're bloomers.  So I rebuff my pants, and there's these little tiny, like, stockings sticking up bloomers.  Come on.  Laced socks.  Mom.  Everything.  How old is he now?  12.  12.  12.  Do you think a 12-year-old boy should be wearing a... 
[00:27:30]  It's very formative.  He's in his formative years here, Mom.  But there's the window of opportunity for female impersonators at his age.  Yeah, certainly a transvestite.  Oh, my God.  Wait, do you know about transvestites, Skid Marks?  Uh-huh.  Oh.  What's your definition of a transvestite, just out of curiosity?  A guy that dresses up like a lemon.  All right.  And, um, makes men.  But I'm not the second part of that.  Oh, okay. 
[00:28:00]  Okay, very good.  Okay, you got a girlfriend or anything?  Uh, nope.  No, not yet?  Would you like a girlfriend?  Do you have, like, an entourage or anything?  Do you have, like, groupies?  Are there Skid Mark groupies out there?  No.  No, huh?  Not yet?  Well, me and Anthony are your groupies.  We have your picture hanging up in our office, actually.  We do.  Any of the girls in school like you?  I don't think so.  No?  No, huh?  Because, you know, I spread the word around that I have Skid Marks, and...  That's where I got my name from.  Well, they're jealous that he dresses better than they do. 
[00:28:30]  Skid Marks.  So that's how you got the name?  Uh-huh.  Because you leave Skid Marks in your drawers.  Yeah, I have a reputation.  Yeah?  Mom, can you confirm that he has Skid Marks in his underwear there?  Confirmed.  Wow.  Very good.  Okay.  But he has holes in her underwear from farting too much.  You guys should get on stage together, I think, at this point.  No?  Okay, so here we go.  We got Skid Marks, and he's ready to perform his Titanic song, and you're going to do it  at a Shirley Temple. 
[00:29:00]  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  What?  Uh-oh.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Shh.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Oh, my God.  Shh.  Shh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That is so wrong.  That is so wrong.  You've got to be kidding me. 
[00:29:30]  Anthony, describe what we did as a witness.  Well, Skid Mark's mom just bent over, put the mic right there, and let one loose.  It was...  The microphone's on the ground now.  I feel better.  I feel better.  That was a pretty good one.  Thank you.  Very nice.  Okay, yeah.  Thank you.  That's lovely.  You know, I've seen some strange things in my radio career. 
[00:30:00]  Oh.  That goes right to the top.  Whew.  That was even more entertaining than Anthony getting beat up by the naked skanko.  That was.  That did the poetry a couple weeks ago.  All right.  He's got to sing, and now he's choking.  All right, Skid Marks, you've got to compose yourself.  We're ready to do the Titanic song here.  All right.  All right.  Titanic song done by Skid Marks.  Here you go, Skid Marks.  As Shirley Temple.  As Shirley Temple.  Here we go.  When the bad ship, the Titanic, hit an iceberg so gigantic, the captain said, by golly, 
[00:30:30]  we're as good as dead.  The ship was filled with water everywhere.  And SOS was radioed throughout the air.  No rescue ships came through.  For all aboard, it was toodaloo.  There weren't enough lifeboats to keep everyone afloat. 
[00:31:00]  Cause the big bad chief engineer.  His unthinkable was sunk.  Ew.  Ew.  He was nominated creep of the year.  Oh, the bad ship.  The Titanic came to rest on the bottom of the Atlantic.  Many did the backstroke.  Until they got really frozen and croaked.  This is the most screwed up family I've ever seen. 
[00:31:30]  I'm amazed.  All right.  We got more.  Wait a minute.  What's the matter, Rick?  It stinks back there?  Don't vote over here.  All right.  We got more with Skid Marks and Skid Marks Mom and more stupidity on the way.  If you want in on this mess, give us a call at 212-957-1027.  Fax is 212-957-WNEW.  We got some Sheryl Crow and Kenny Wayne's separate necks. 
[00:32:00]  All right, Anthony.  I think it's worth another listen.  All right.  Let's hear.  So here we go.  We got Skid Marks.  And he's ready to perform his Titanic song.  And you're going to do it as Shirley Temple.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  What?  Uh-oh.  Hold on.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Shh. 
[00:32:30]  43-year-old lady.  Let us know.  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York, Sheryl Crow.  All I want to do is Sheryl Crow.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.

[00:35:00]  drawing okay very good 1027 wnew the rock of new york the latest from creed off their debut cd my own  prison that's what's this life for cd has gone double platinum for the boys from florida  sophie and anthony hanging i hope you're having fun listening yeah we're having fun and all we ask  if we make you laugh and entertain you on the way home you just make us one of your presets  we're noticing we're working our way up the preset that's why slowly but surely um we're also  noticing that people are out there spreading the word about the show we appreciate that too thank you 
[00:35:30]  because we have noticed that uh we have a very small faithful um audience that enjoys the show  now we need to uh tell others yes because it's frustrating for me and anthony uh someone called  yesterday and said wow i really like your show i'm like cool how long have you been listening um two  days two days we've been busting our ass for three and a half months you know you see this um  oprah thing yeah i was just uh noticing that on the front page what do you think about that well 
[00:36:00]  michael lewinski was supposed to go on oprah for the big huge exclusive interview  yeah like so much meat they're just marketing monica now they got her handlers whatever they  got lawyers or whatever and they're just now they're whoring her out again first it was bill  have had her as uh his whore and now her lawyers are whoring her out to talk shows that's trying to  turn a buck honestly though she just you know she deserves the buck it is america and people do this 
[00:36:30]  all the time why not and if she could get a million dollars to tell her side of the story  exactly why not once again you gotta uh hats off to the new york post with their headlines yeah  monica blue talk deal  whenever they could work work in the word blow blue suck whatever they will also uh game me and  anthony like to play every day we go through the new york papers and count how many pictures there are  of monica with her mouth open yeah you'll be surprised how many there are every day if you want to play 
[00:37:00]  along but it amounts to the hundreds you know so she's going to do this uh exclusive interview on  someone's show obviously uh-huh there's not much else to tell right if you've read the star report i  mean what else is there that she left out no everyone just wants to hear her talk yeah that's true no one  knows what she speak no one knows what she sounds like that's very true that's the big thing i think  uh monica lewinski should go on uh rosie's show and you wouldn't be able to tell who is who exactly  they look the same they got the same exact hairdo working you know what the uh the thing is though 
[00:37:30]  oprah is coming off now like she's uh the the clean squeaky clean talk show i'm not paying money i'm  not doing yeah because i guess on yesterday's show she announced that um you know that she has passed  on the monica lewinski yeah interview and the audience just went nuts like you know she's a messiah  yeah well the truth of the matter is uh it came down to who was going to have rights to the videotape  of her on the show yeah like her people wanted her to have rights to the videotape of her on oprah 
[00:38:00]  so it could be sold overseas or wherever right well because technically oprah doesn't pay for interviews  right but oprah makes an s load of money every time these uh high profile celebrities come on her show  of course of course you know oprah's uh acting all high and mighty but you know what type of ratings  that would be an oprah show would get with monica lewinski and ratings  would mean lots and lots of ad dollars yeah and she wanted uh exclusive rights to the the videotape 
[00:38:30]  yeah of the interview yeah and then oprah uh wasn't going to get that so she said no then forget it  so she's not all that everyone's in it for a buck of course kidding so what show you think monica's  going to end up on i would love to see her on jerry springer the open anthony show yeah that'd be  cool jerry you think that would be wild a little brawl yeah bring out uh hillary could bring out the  whole family man i don't know i think it's going to get to the point where really people really don't 
[00:39:00]  care yeah you know she should go on to whatever the hell show she can get on now because in another  few months no one's going to care at all uh this story unfortunately has legs it's so weird i mean  doesn't jay leno have any other jokes i'm kind of embarrassed for him i was watching him last  night yeah half his monologue is like the bill and uh monica jokes still yeah and like the obvious  ones cigar jokes and stuff it's like it's so done it is done as far as making fun of it i mean he's  probably told a thousand jokes about bill and monica yeah you know you're supposed to be this uh 
[00:39:30]  great comedian start talking about other stuff i can't think of anything else i mean bungle well the  phones are ringing like crazy everyone wants to play uh piss off a texan um i don't know we're not  happy with the results yet though people don't really get the message in honor of the yankees we  are playing this lovely game where we call a random texan get you on the phone with the texan and you  have 30 seconds to make them hang up yes but you got to be like witty you got to have some chops about  you yeah and you can't curse let's see what we could get happening here hi any w hey open anthony 
[00:40:00]  what's going on hey what's up this is jt from connecticut how you doing hey you want to piss off  the texan i could do it for you well um people aren't doing a good job with this game i'll tell  you what i got i got i got it for him all right we'll give you a shot all right man all right here  it comes all right here we go brother all right good luck electrical maintenance yes how you doing  this is jt roman suck from the daily item in westchester new york uh-huh oh listen i'd like to ask you about 
[00:40:30]  how you feel about the texas rangers tonight against the new york yankees how do i feel about  them yes i do oh i don't know they have to snap ahead right now i guess i hope they win you hope  they win between gundalas and rodriguez bunch of puerto ricans inside the dugout eating rice and beans  how do you think they're going to beat the yankees running the big fat bucks around the bases farting  all over the place now you think they'll be able to touch our yankees huh you know what talk to me  snap ahead right now there you go did it win there you go that's how you do it did it win yeah 
[00:41:00]  we'll give you a prize package that's not bad we're getting better at this hold on the line all right  man not bad well let's yeah yeah we'll play this for the rest of the week so you know but you got to  get really creative yeah gotta get throw some intelligence in there think about it the rock of  new york 1027 wnew collective soul little band from stockbridge georgia that's december 
[00:41:30]  sophie and anthony having a lot of fun once again today hope you're enjoying it uh wherever you're  listening to us a lot of people making us preset one today because of uh skin marks mom farting  you never know what's going to make people put us on their preset  i i i i i don't even know what to say no i was um very amused to say the least skid mark's mom  actually blasted one out 
[00:42:00]  how old was she 42 43 43 year old woman yeah her son 12 year old son sitting here  yeah singing little songs cute little song parodies about tragedy yes uh actually he was ready to start  his song yeah and she went oh wait a minute wait wait wait bent over put her butt against the mic and  let loose it was a fellini scene you know what i think we gained more listeners from that than  anything else we've done lately i think we gained more listeners than uh than turned off listeners 
[00:42:30]  really okay maybe the tide is changing for us a little bit getting a few calls on the page plant  live concert we're doing tomorrow night that's exclusively here on anyw it's happening uh from  new orleans and it will be uh getting underway at 10 30 tomorrow night all right because people have  been asking about that also people asking for the road rage bid from yesterday yes a bit i must say  the boss did not like yeah there's a couple of those the boss doesn't like so we're going against him 
[00:43:00]  here and we're going to play it we're going to use our we don't care the boss didn't like it card  yeah pull that one out pretty much all right i think he gets influenced by uh two or three you  know complaint calls and they get you people that complain shut up yeah because you're confusing our  show gonna wreck it maybe tomorrow you know you could flood our boss gary yeah with uh you know happy  calls i love the road rage bit yeah just over and over again just call him all day long you'll get  through everyone gets through to the boss his name's gary yeah and uh just say i love the road rage bit 
[00:43:30]  there you go and just uh all day long call him i'm serious because if he's in a good mood then he  doesn't yell at us as much before the show what did he say he didn't like the profanity there was a  lot of profanity used yeah he thought it um wasn't highbrow enough but you know something problem is this  is a taste of reality it's not like we're writing a script this is what people do when they're on the  roadways yeah ask my wife if uh i don't yell like that yeah when i have road rage yeah i think i didn't 
[00:44:00]  curse enough that's usually i'm cursing a lot more i think we're giving our listeners a little  insight on uh you know what goes on when uh we're not here in the studio 1027 w anyw the rock of new  york brian adams and the latest from lenny kravitz before that fly away it's opie and anthony hey  having an absolute uh riot today i hope you're enjoying it everyone wants to hear uh skidmark's  mom farting again so i think we'll end the show with that yeah that was a special moment in a few  minutes we'll do that just before seven just before matt devoti takes over i don't know what 
[00:44:30]  the hell's going on in the the skid house the skidsters house i i like his fart song too yeah  that was pretty pretty funny maybe we'll end with that and then end with his mom farting that could  be fun all right a good wrap up yeah it will be on this uh new year right what isn't it a new year  it's the new fiscal year don't we have to blow into like one of those big  what the uh the the chauffeur yeah no that's the other holiday isn't it i don't know i don't know 
[00:45:00]  we don't have any jewish people here because they're all home for the holiday and i don't  think any jewish people are allowed to listen to us so i mean we want to know what you have to  blow on this holiday i think that's um rosh hashanah rosh hashanah you get a big like  corn thing out yeah and what is this yom kippur yom kippur yeah all right hey oh there's a funny story  in the daily news today really fast i think a lot of us could relate to this from our our uh  dangerous days a statue of the baby jesus stolen from a church in eastport two years ago was turned 
[00:45:30]  into a bong a water pipe used to smoke marijuana suffolk police said oh really that's what a bong  is thank you for telling me they gotta tell you isn't that amazing i guess they stole this like  little statues little shrine in front of the church and these kids turned it into a bong  very creative so they're smoking dope out of jesus's head that's the baby jesus dude 
[00:46:00]  and then after they smoke it they do see god so you have to be creative i remember when i was uh  smoking the marijuana cigarettes opi now anthony doesn't smoke anymore i don't i know and uh i don't  either by the way i remember though you know you you can make it out of an apple yeah you know you  would put it take a big thing out of the apple and then put a pencil through it or a pen and smoke it  out of an apple who would have thought of that i smoked it out of a carrot once a carrot and i smoked  it out of a uh wiffle ball bat that was how you can smoke out of a wiffle ball bat it's kind of hard but 
[00:46:30]  just figure it out it has that tiny little hole at the bottom of the bat oh so you just cut a hole at the  other end yeah and then with like some tin foil yeah exactly in holding it exactly there you go  that was the the most creative we got when we were growing up yeah my brother was always smoking weed  back when uh we were younger and he couldn't have any smoking paraphernalia around the house because  then you know mom would know so he would take like a cigarette pack cut a hole in it put some tin foil 
[00:47:00]  poke some holes and smoke it out of that and then leave that laying around  might as well just leave a six foot bong in the living room well your mom was kind of clueless  when it came to drugs in your household let's face it anthony that's true she didn't know was uh  raising pot plants in the backyard 12 feet high and 12 foot high pot plants in the backyard and he  convinced her it was basil and oregano hybrid and so i don't think your mom would have figured out  that the cigarette pack trick and i think this is after she started like smoking pot your mom smoked pot 
[00:47:30]  oh yeah kidding really oh yeah back in the you know mid 70s mid to late 70s pot coke who knows  what she was up to i wonder if my mom ever smoked dope yeah she went through that phase you know  after uh pop left went to california and then she uh had to take care of the kids and then she just  exploded and said you know something i'm having fun and she crammed about 20 years of fun into about  four or five years wow yeah that's pretty bizarre i met your mom i can't imagine her token up it's 
[00:48:00]  pretty awful for uh us kids for a while just ask joe that's joe how he woke up one night you know  leaves a scar when you're in your bedroom sleep and you hear from your mom's room oh get out of here  i'm not kidding your your brother heard your mom having sex yeah with who who knows  you're lying i'm not lying he banged on the wall shut up like he wants to hear that you know 
[00:48:30]  pretty inconsiderate mom get a room are you serious yeah this was back in the 70s what  do i know well no i never heard my parents doing it you didn't no no that would horrify me yeah  just well i never heard it but i just heard joe banging on the wall really knock it off god  what a tragic childhood you had yeah the dad that used to pick you up in his little red sports coat  no he was a sports boy sports car sorry no he booked out to california yeah yeah and mom i remember 
[00:49:00]  mom bringing home remember for the mess your mom brought home yeah  yeah and he couldn't one night because he he couldn't one night because his was cut  and uh and and mom's like oh yeah cut his razor blade doing get out of here yeah you're gonna get  sued for saying this on the air let him come forward mom will testify right mom no i noticed something 
[00:49:30]  anthony what you surprisingly look a lot like felix meon  one oh two seven wnaw the rock of new york johnny lang lie to me it's opian anthony just about out the  dope yeah gotta thank uh skid marks for coming in with his mom today  that was some scene yeah he was the star of the show today without a doubt yeah uh matter of fact i got  his uh i like to fart song all right we'd like to end our show uh from time to time with fart humor 
[00:50:00]  uh yes because fart equals funny bring it up a notch um yeah well skid marks he's 12 years old  he does song parodies uh some very creative ones and then he has this one which is uh i'd like to fart  and he came in to perform some of these songs live for us but we found out thank god in time that the  farts you're about to hear in this song are actually real farts yeah that he and his mom did they ate a 
[00:50:30]  bunch of uh chili right and uh put a bag over the microphone yeah why i don't even want to know and  then uh when one came out they they recorded it yes and put it in the song and we found out that uh  the really loud farts are uh skid marks moms well the size would have to resonate yeah yeah she's 43  farting helping her kid do this song yes and then the little cute little tiny little uh mouse farts  are skid marks so check this out i got a song for you anyone out there want to pull my finger i like to 
[00:51:00]  fart i'm a master of this art i pass a lot of air through my derriere  no one can surpass my skill of passing gas my technique of ripping parts is highly state of 
[00:51:30]  that's the mom  that's the mom so all right so then they came in and uh uh skid marks was ready to perform his titanic  song right anthony yes and they were live right there to our left and we had been coaxing uh his 
[00:52:00]  mom to belt one out when we found out she actually did backup uh backup farts yeah on the fart song  yeah and she sat there for a while and then right before skid marks was ready to do his titanic song  she went oh wait and and left </pre>
