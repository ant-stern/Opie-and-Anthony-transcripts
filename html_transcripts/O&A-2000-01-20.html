<pre> 1027 WNEW it's the Opie and Anthony show thanks for joining us.  Hey there.  As you slowly make your way home today.  Yeah, hey.  It's gotta be a complete nightmare out there.  I guess people are driving like a-holes out on the road.  I don't think anyone's driving like a-hole.  I think it's just like everyone's going like five miles an hour.  Playing a little follow the leader.  Choo, choo. 
[00:30]
 Will I ever get home?  I've been on the road for two hours.  This usually takes 20 minutes.  Great, thank you.  Get out of the way.  The best is the compact car that slows you down because you have the SUV and you're right  behind them.  Yeah.  You son of a bitches.  Let me enjoy my SUV.  It's snowing.  That's what my truck was made for.  Days like today.  You always get behind the compact car on the side road that's like, oh, it's much too dangerous 
[01:00]
 to go over, let's say, eight miles an hour.  And then there's just a line of cars behind them.  If I'm going to go eight miles an hour, everyone else should go eight miles an hour, Anthony.  Yes.  I'm going to be in my Cherokee on the way home from this studio behind some little Gio  fighting the urge to knock him into a utility pole because he's going five miles an hour.  Yeah.  I'm going to leave in the studio from the unofficial Opium Anthony website.  Yes.  So, well, we hope you're hanging in there. 
[01:30]
 A bunch of people want to play Make Opium Anthony Cry today.  What?  Because I hold WWF.  Oh, really?  That's pretty funny.  You missed some good radio if you're just turning in today.  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, Anthony.  What's happening?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  You're joining the dark side, man.  Yeah, we're talking about divorce a little bit today.  Yeah, oh, God.  I'm on the drive new every two plan.  What?  You're on the drive new wife every two years. 
[02:00]
 Oh, Jesus.  Why the hell are you insane?  No, what I don't understand about it.  This is the last one.  This is it, man.  I finally found a good woman.  The first one, man, she raked me over the coals.  All right.  Hold on, hold on.  What I don't understand about your divorces out there, why would you quickly get right  back into another marriage?  Why?  Yeah.  Why would you do that?  I don't know, because nobody else told me.  I'm having a real tough time committing ones. 
[02:30]
 I'm certainly not going to commit two, three times.  This is it, man.  If this happens again, I'm hitting the St. Thomas.  All right.  What was it?  What did they say divorce was?  The effing you get for the effing you got?  All right, Rich, very good.  I'll catch you later, man.  All right, bye.  Peace.  All right, Rich, we'll see you next on the program.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  You're about to find out how manipulative of a bitch she is.  Let me tell you.  I started working in the financial district downtown on Wall Street, making a good amount 
[03:00]
 of jing.  I take jing.  You like that?  Yeah, that's really cool.  So I get a bonus.  So I take her on vacation.  Come back from vacation, I spent about $12,000 on this vacation.  I come back from vacation at our front door, the new house we just bought hands me divorce  papers.  Wow.  Yeah.  You want to talk about a bitch?  Oh my God.  I'm working three jobs.  I got to work three jobs.  I drive a 74 Camaro because I can't afford anything else because my wife has got the 
[03:30]
 new Jeep.  Oh my God.  And this is still going on almost two years.  You got any kids?  No, thank God.  The whole point was I bought a house in Bedford up in Westchester.  Nice big house.  And I said, okay, you don't have to work anymore.  I make it a good amount of money.  I want kids.  I want kids.  So she doesn't work.  So the majority of the time that we're married, she is not working.  So now everything that I'm making is going to be fucked over to her.  I'm trying to get somebody to sneak in there, put a little bit of Geraino on a frigging 
[04:00]
 salad so she's fine.  Oh my God, dude.  I think worse than getting divorced would be being in prison.  I wasn't too bad compared to marriage.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  I met this girl in college, the best lay I ever had in my entire life.  And I'm thinking, all right, this is the one for me.  I've done everything I want to do.  I'm going to settle down.  I'm going to get married.  Now this is the one.  And it's almost like from the beginning, she knew what she was going to do. 
[04:30]
 Like from birth, her mother trained her, that bitch.  I heard her mother on the phone five times a day yapping about God knows what.  All right, Nick.  Unbelievable.  So I'm working three jobs now.  I'm driving a cab in the South Bronx.  Yeah.  Oh, you don't know.  How can I do that if I have to be on the air?  Huh?  So I could do the shift here, get off at 7, and then start driving a hack?  I got a friend that drives here that drives, has a black car company.  I could probably hook you up.  Yeah, if you could hook me up.  Yeah, I'd do that.  And then I'd walk in on the weekends. 
[05:00]
 All right, Nick.  We're going to let you go before we start playing Make Nick Cry.  Yeah, unbelievable.  All right, Nick.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Thank you.  Wow.  Florence, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  Oh, let me tell you.  I'm talking about all the bitches and so on.  I have the opposite.  My ex-husband soon to be is the bastard.  The bitch?  Yeah, you know, it's not always the gal that's the real bad one in the divorce scene.  Sometimes the guy can do it too. 
[05:30]
 Yeah.  What happened was I had a car and my husband lost his job, got his job.  That and other things were leading to the divorce.  When we separated, I said, look, you know, use the car.  Now, this car is mine, registered to me and everything.  I said, use it so you don't lose your job.  You just started.  Two months go by and I'm spending, you know, money on tips to go to work.  So I called him up and I said, look, you know, I really need the car back.  He says, the car's not working. 
[06:00]
 I said, what do you mean?  It's just the car's, you know, on 98.  What's wrong with it?  It's just not working.  I called him the next day at work just to see if, you know, maybe he was there.  Sure enough, he was there.  Something doesn't sound right.  I tell people at work, a friend of mine goes down, go and look at the car,  and the wires are off to the car.  Oh, God damn, wow. 
[06:30]
 Florence?  Is that a...  Oh, uh, Florence?  You got a little Florence on your cheek.  Don't wipe that off.  There they go into the setting sun.  Florence?  Hello?  Florence, something happened to your phone, I believe.  Boy, they had a perfect lock on that target.  Frank's laughing on the phone.  What's up, Frank?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  That never gets old, now, does it?  Nothing funnier than an airstrike. 
[07:00]
 Well, I guarantee you're not going to do that to me because I got the hell of a story.  All right.  All right.  Anthony, first of all, can your wife read?  I'm not getting into details.  Okay.  If she can't read, like my illiterate bitch, well then, that's cool,  because here's my situation.  My ex-wife, all right, was soon to be, was still in litigation.  She basically was strung up on Xanax.  Whoa.  Right?  And I, you know, I was really a good husband. 
[07:30]
 I make a really good salary, you know, she didn't work,  she had a brand new truck, four by four, all the good stuff.  You know, we had our own house.  Time went on, I just got to the point, I said, you know what?  I can't deal with this Xanax crap.  You know, she'd have mood swings, and she'd throw stuff at me when she was all pissed off.  You know, I was totally out of control.  So, me being, you know, smarter than the average bear,  I turned around and said, you know what?  I'm not dealing with this.  I put the house up for sale. 
[08:00]
 Sold the house within, I don't know, a couple of months of putting it on market.  Yeah.  And she was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, where are we going to move?  I said, I don't know.  I said, I don't like the house, and that's it.  I'm selling it.  So, we sold the house.  And the next thing I know, I go down to an attorney.  Now, I had a female attorney.  Let me tell you, female attorney fight fire with fire.  Women are bitches.  So, my ex-wife was a bitch.  So, I made sure I got the bitchiest lawyer on earth. 
[08:30]
 Let me tell you, she did me good.  Now, the other thing I could say is my ex-wife, she don't work, right?  So, how is she going to get herself an attorney?  So, my attorney says to me, she goes, are you willing to pay her an attorney?  I said, sure, why not?  She said, how much?  You know, a couple of grand.  She's like, yeah.  Now, me thinking in my head, if I'm paying this guy's lawyer's fees,  oh, boy, I got this guy wrapped too.  Rounded up, I walked away almost scot-free.  Almost scot-free.  I mean, you know, I don't know what everybody's telling you. 
[09:00]
 Everybody's saying, you know, you're going to have to pay this lady.  You married her for 10 years.  You're going to have to pay her for 10 years.  That's a line of crap.  Okay?  The law is basically saying, I got to pay my ex-wife for three years,  and then she's got to go back to work, and then I just pay the child support.  Right?  Right.  So, you know, I'm going with the law and everything.  So, now she's getting all, you know, the papers haven't been served,  and she's getting, like, an old Xanaxed out.  She turns around, she throws a brick through the front window of the house,  the side of the apartment. 
[09:30]
 And I already moved out, you know?  And I'm like, man, what the hell is going on here?  It's just down the tracks.  Yeah.  I turn around, and, you know, she's got the cops there,  filled out this police report.  Next thing I know, I got this cop coming to my house.  Go for the gun, Andrew.  With a, you know, a warrant for arrest.  Trains too good.  Go for the gun.  For what?  What the hell did I do?  Where's your gun?  And he turned around, and he made the act with his accusation.  So I went down to the precinct, and I told him I was going through a divorce. 
[10:00]
 So she gets some order of protection, right?  So now, that's getting...  That's to the point.  Um, Frank?  Well, Frank, thank you for your story.  We appreciate it.  Carl, help us out.  We need a good story.  It's WNEW.  What's up?  Oh, man, Anthony, you're in trouble.  Oh, yeah?  I...  Where I start off, I suspect that my wife's fooling around,  having a little bit of an affair. 
[10:30]
 I'm working two jobs, busting my ass.  I tap the phone.  I end up grabbing the tape.  I hear her talking to a hillbilly.  His name is Jimmy Lee, and he's talking how he can't wait to move into my house,  use my benefits, and ride in my brand new car.  Wow.  Yeah, it even gets better.  It's 100% better.  Well, I went and I said, I'm going to be decent.  I want to leave. 
[11:00]
 I move out of my house.  She gets full run of the house.  Her mother and father came to me and told me,  why don't you stay with her?  Don't worry, this is all going to pass.  And I said, no, I can't.  I can't deal with this.  Did you own the house?  Oh, yeah.  Are you serious?  I used to own a house.  I'm living in a studio apartment, and if I work a second job,  she's entitled to that part of that money, too. 
[11:30]
 I had to pay her $1,500 a month.  I was only making $2,000.  My studio apartment was $650.  And like I said, if I had a second job, she was entitled to that money.  The judges in Suffolk County really, really suck.  And they're all for the women.  They're all for the women.  In the end, I ended up spending about $50,000 in lawyer fees. 
[12:00]
 I got screwed big.  All right, Carl, thank you.  Okay, thank you, guys.  There he goes, Carl, everyone.  There's a horror story.  I can see Anthony tearing up.  I can see Anthony.  All right, we got to take a break.  As we go to break, this... 
[12:30]
 Oh, you got any more of that Valium, I'll be...  Yeah, I do, actually.  This song is very appropriate from Stephen Lynch.  Check it out.  Well, it's not on the CD, because it's kind of a special song.  It's not on the CD because it sucks?  That would seem to follow, wouldn't it?  No, it's actually not a very funny song.  If you don't mind, my wife and I were recently divorced.  You're 12.  I know.  You're 12. 
[13:00]
 Short marriage.  Okay, okay.  How old are you?  I'm 27.  27?  All right.  Yeah.  And my wife of 16 years, Erin, and I divorced recently.  And we have a little six-year-old girl.  She doesn't really understand why mommy isn't living with us anymore.  Yeah.  I did my best to write this little lullaby, perhaps explain it to her.  I like the setup.  It's great.  Thanks.  You can bring it down a little bit here if you want. 
[13:30]
 Tonight.  Daddy's here and you sing your soft lullaby.  Tonight.  Why can't it all be like it was before? 
[14:00]
 How can I explain why mommy's not here anymore?  Cause daddy likes porno and ten dollar horse.  Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores.  Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus. 
[14:30]
 I think that's why your mommy left us.  Ready?  On.  Hush, little girl.  There is no reason to fret tonight.  Don't mind the smoke.  Daddy just wants to forget.  Tonight. 
[15:00]
 Soon it will all be like it was before.  Any minute she will walk through that front door.  But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer.  Then he wants sex that involves mommy's rear. 
[15:30]
 Daddy has sores on his genitals oozing with pus.  I think that's why your mommy left us.  Please don't cry.  I swear I'll try to be here by your side. 
[16:00]
 Right after daddy gets home from the bar.  Visits his bookie and steals a new card.  He'll drive to the strip club and if daddy plays his cards right.  He'll bring home your new mommy tonight.  Lady day, lady day, lady day, lady day, lady day.  Lady day, lady day, lady day, lady day. 
[16:30]
 Lady day, lady day, lady day, lady day.  Look at me.  Oh Megan.  Look at me.  I'm all teared up now.  I'm welling up with tears.  Even Dice is tearing up over there.  You got me.  You got my sensitive side.  Check this.  Anthony.  Do you think I would go in the air and make a complete buffoon of myself?  Anthony.  My tampon is sitting a little askew today. 
[17:00]
 Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  20 girls want to bang me.  20 girls want to bang me.  1027 WNEW.  O.B. and Anthony afternoon.  Mason and Kalinsky morning.  The Radio Chick Midday on 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[17:30]
 You're not going to believe this but the Rock is upstairs after everything we've been through today Anthony.  Yeah.  And on the phone line, we're going to be talking about the Rock.  We're going to be talking about the Rock.  We're going to be talking about the Rock.  We're going to be talking about the Rock.  We're going to be talking about the Rock.  We're going to be talking about the Rock.  We're going to be talking about the Rock.  We're going to be talking about the Rock. 
[18:00]
 We're going to be talking about the Rock.  We're going to be talking about the Rock.  Well that's peanuts baby because you're the best show in the nation.  Look at that.  Well we won that.  The best non-sports show in the nation.  Do you know we won that award too last year?  Sports show?  No, for the whole country.  You did?  Yeah, best afternoon show.  Best afternoon show.  Alright so we got that going on right?  Well congratulations and it's not a surprise to me.  I also want to congratulate you. 
[18:30]
 Howard used your line today.  Which one?  It's the map of Hawaii.  Can you believe that?  He talked.  Whatever.  Congratulations, there you go.  How could a guy, and when he had that day of mourning with his, when he got separated,  and all the callers called in like oh we're so sorry.  Look, when you print a book that's a national best seller and sells 30 million copies, and  you have a picture of your wife in a coffin and you go if only my wife could die of cancer, 
[19:00]
 these are the first 10 women I'd have sex with.  Like what, you didn't see the writing on the wall?  Like I didn't do certain jokes in my act because I don't want to piss off my wife.  I go I used to date girls that snore, wink wink.  So whatever.  But he used your line today so congratulations again.  Oh that's Jay Moore's line.  Oh no, not at all, but then in the next breath he was calling us clones and stuff of him.  Well I think you're very funny gentlemen and I enjoy listening to you and when I get off 
[19:30]
 the phone with you I always make Rick keep me on hold so I can listen to the show.  I invented Hawaii Robin.  He's become a little Richard.  Shut up, I invented it, shut up.  I invented radio.  Did you get a dime?  Jay, we've got to put you on hold because we've got to deal with the rock situation.  Tell me real fast about the WWF party last night.  We never got in, we got an invitation, we RSVP'd, we stood on a freezing cold line waiting to get in 
[20:00]
 and they sent us away like cattle.  Because you were open and answerable?  No, just they didn't, they overbooked the place so about a thousand people waited for about an hour  in nine degree weather and then they finally said sorry, we're in their magazine this month where  Did you go up to the front and say look we're open and answerable?  Yeah.  Award winning?  And they could care less.  Alright, hold on the line, we might go to you, alright?  Okay.  Hey Rick, what's going on buddy? 
[20:30]
 Not much, I'm upstairs with the notorious rock.  Alright.  And he's now outside talking to his peeps so to speak.  Oh really?  Yeah, so I think they're going to pull him out of here believe it or not.  You're not going to put him on the phone?  I don't know, we'll see.  Alright.  Here he comes.  Okay.  Alright, cool.  Here he comes.  Here we go.  I don't care what.  Hello.  Hey Duane.  What's this?  It's Opien Anthony Duane, how are you?  Boys, how y'all doing?  Pretty good, very good.  What's going on?  Not much, what's going on with you? 
[21:00]
 Not too much at all.  Whoever sang that last song was pretty damn good.  That's a good one right?  I'd say it's entertaining.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Well we were looking forward to seeing you guys.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing you guys.  You know, I'm a little worried about you guys, I mean I'm a little worried about you guys  being a little worried about the fact that you're getting into a bad situation.  I mean I'm a little worried about you guys being a little worried about the fact that  you're getting into a bad situation.  Yeah, I heard about that.  I just got buzzed about that.  The best I could do is apologize.  That damn candy ass Jim Byrne didn't do what he needed to do.  Nah, we just...  Hey, you know what?  Legitimately, y'all should be pissed off about that.  I absolutely agree. 
[21:30]
 You know, he did tell me you guys were coming down.  I'd look forward to seeing y'all.  But I apologize about that.  Really?  This is a little awkward.  I mean, I'm a little worried about you guys being a little worried about you guys being  a little worried about you guys being a little worried about you guys being a little worried  about you guys being a little worried about you guys being a little worried about you guys  being a little worried about you guys being a little worried about you guys being a little  I went ahead and a you know, let's leave the  stuff out there.  Actually that didn't happen.  It's not really an issue.  We didn't really deal with it.  Here's the thing, you're absolutely right, we didn't do that. 
[22:00]
 Now that I'm here, I appreciate you all letting me on.  The thing about that was, as far as for being in the same room, I was buzzed about that  guy, Sickboy.  He came in, I just certainly couldn't be in the same room with an ass like that.  If you all took it personal, it certainly didn't mean to be taken that way.  I just had to get the hell out of the room and that's the way it was.  The way I left wasn't the most professional way.  I shouldn't have left like that. 
[22:30]
 But at the same time, I just couldn't be in the same room with that ass.  I wasn't.  Excuse the language.  I did let a lot of listeners down and realize that.  But you took it personal.  We took it very personal because I told you flat out and I had no idea what you were talking  about.  You didn't believe us.  No, no, no.  That really wasn't the case.  It wasn't the case that I didn't believe you guys.  It was just a case.  I had this guy sitting right here beside me.  If not, I wouldn't have bashed his brains in.  That's something I take it very personally in terms of racial discrimination. 
[23:00]
 You know, doing that, I didn't want you guys to take it personal.  I'm not saying I didn't believe you guys.  When you guys flat out looked me in the eye and said, we have no idea what you're talking  about.  We have no clue about this guy's website.  Well, that was the truth.  It's just like I told Jim Byrne earlier.  I even talked with Vince.  I said, you know, whether or not those guys knew really wasn't the case.  And I pretty much believed them that I didn't know.  I just had a guest on who had this real crappy website posting racist comments. 
[23:30]
 The point was I just couldn't be in the same room with that guy.  I got out by last.  I took it personal in terms of him being there with me.  Again, one of the most professional thing to do just to get up and walk off the walk  off you guys show that way.  I know you guys are big supporters.  WBF were of the rock.  I knew that too.  Read the article, saw one of you was chewing on the rock's head.  But, you know, again, it was never made to be taken personal towards you all too. 
[24:00]
 I just was pissed that you left without even like when we were off the air.  I just wish you were like, drag this out in the hall and explain yourself.  Well, I certainly could have done that.  We were we weren't that was I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  Well, we were. That was the thing.  We were in shock.  We're like, where the hell did this come from?  At least explain yourself.  And then the WBF doesn't even, you know, have the courtesy to like calls the next day to  explain what the hell was going on.  Oh, see, I thought they did.  No, no.  OK, I thought they know what is ever given us an explanation until right now. 
[24:30]
 They were pissed at us.  Oh, is that right? It's kind of weird.  Yeah, because then I won't say who called us, but one of your people's call and said  that you guys were listening after you left and you're not and you and they weren't happy  about what was going on.  Well, who called you might as well say who the candy was.  Susan Warner.  OK, one that's probably right next to right now.  OK, so she gave me her cell.  She gave me her cell phone number.  I called her back and she I guess you were busy at the book signing.  I was. I did have a book signing.  And she wouldn't she said, well, I can't discuss it now. 
[25:00]
 And that was the last we heard.  And then on top of that, you know, we were like shut out of the cute little party last  night, so we're really pissed off.  No, no, I don't blame you about the party.  I don't blame you one one bit about the party.  And had I known you, I was standing out there again.  Jim Burns buzzed me last night that you guys were because I hadn't talked to Jim.  I said, listen, Jim, I called him yesterday and we finally talked last night at the  at the WWF New York. I said, you know, where those guys that I want to know  where we're at in terms of this, I need to talk to him beforehand to let him, 
[25:30]
 you know, let myself explain what happened.  So anyway, he told me that you guys were supposed to be there.  And I know you guys are freeing your asses off out there.  I would have had Jim or somebody with Jim Dotson or somebody just come up  and get you guys.  We had like girls with us. We looked like ass wipes, man.  It's like all of a sudden, the cops are chasing us away.  Our chicks are looking at us like with like a couple of losers, man.  It was so effing embarrassing, man.  And Rick, Rick, who's up there with you, he's pounding on the on the  the window of the place and everyone's ignoring us.  He went up to a couple of WWF people and they they didn't know who we were. 
[26:00]
 We weren't on any list. It was just it was just bad.  We had our stupid little imitations like everybody else.  They got chased away. It was just so friggin embarrassing.  And you had skirt with you to boot.  Yeah. You know how bad that looks.  It looked good, especially coming off the heels of Roger there.  Yeah, of course.  You know, I wanted to see you guys last night as I wanted to see you guys today.  I wanted to come back on the show. You guys know that.  I sat with Vince and I said, you know, there's got to be a way to reconcile this. 
[26:30]
 I know these guys are big fans or we're big fans for that matter  of the product and as well as the WWF, as well as the Rock.  And I said, you know, I really need to reconcile this.  I didn't want them to take me leaving off their show personally.  It wasn't like that. You guys come up, let the rock on.  And I appreciate that.  But, you know, again, the reasoning was it was just that I just couldn't be  in the same room with that guy. And that was it.  You know, him being there beside me, I took a personal again. 
[27:00]
 You know, I wanted to stick my foot so far up area deep into his into his ass.  But, yeah, just again, I just couldn't be there.  And walking off your guys show wasn't the best thing to do.  But, you know, at the time, I thought it was the right thing to do.  And I didn't mean for you all to take it personally.  And again, too, you know, what made it even worse was, you know,  I had a lot of rock fans listening that day.  And, you know, for the most part, they kind of took a personal too.  Yeah, which certainly wasn't the case.  You know, I never, ever meant it to be that way.  I just wanted to let them know, too, as well, that it wasn't personal 
[27:30]
 against the fans, wasn't personal against Opie and Anthony or your show.  For that matter, I just couldn't be in the same room with that guy.  And as far as the party,  you know,  there's a way to make it up.  If at all, if you guys are interested in doing that, you just go on and let me know.  Well, we're like we're like hurt, man.  Yeah, we feel like losers and everything.  But and we don't really feel like being in the same room with you. 
[28:00]
 No, we can't we can't we're we're we can't in good conscience, you know,  have you come down in here when we couldn't get into your establishment or,  you know, your company's establishment?  Right. You know what I mean?  So it's like I know what you mean.  No explanation needed.  I understand that.  We have we also we also have our fans that,  you know, look to us to do certain things and stand up for what we believe in.  It's wrong. It's wrong. What happened last night was wrong. 
[28:30]
 I don't blame you guys one bit for standing up.  No problem.  All right. We're filled to capacity in here today.  Yeah, we're filled to capacity.  Please disperse.  There's just no cops up here.  There's the other we could send a couple.  We got a couple down here.  I'm sure you'd give a pretty good fight.  Can we get a picture?  You like banging on the glass truck?  All right, Rock.  We're going to have to air strike.  Yeah. All right. No, no sweat.  Appreciate it. All right.  Later. Bye. 
[29:00]
 There he goes.  Hey, Jay, you guys are brutal.  You guys have more balls than the NBA.  Good. We've made him call from our lobby.  He wasn't turned up in the whole show.  I'm listening. I thought you guys were going to go, well, let's see what Jay thinks.  And I wrote like all these notes.  Oh, yeah, that's all we need.  He was sorry.  Why? He opened the conversation with an apology. 
[29:30]
 Yeah. Called his own boss a candy ad.  We know the rock has issues of rage.  And he seemed like a guy that's been to some anger management therapy sessions.  He's determined with what he did wrong.  I don't know what it's like to be an African American, nor do I pretend to be.  But I can imagine if a guy was sitting next to me that made jokes about me being a half  breed on a website in my head. 
[30:00]
 And if I was the rock and had issues of rage and I was sitting next to that person and his name,  you know, sick boy, sick boy's new name, by the way, is rocker.  And John. There you go.  I was like, yeah, well, let the guy in.  I was like, as far as, you know, you guys wait down the cold Anthony.  I mean, Opie, I feel for it.  But, you know, Opie, I don't feel that bad for it because he had coats and stuff.  Anthony, we know, is cold blooded.  He couldn't die.  Anthony could have died out there.  No, Opie can come out like sweaters and stuff. 
[30:30]
 But what can Anthony do?  Wait for the touch to come out and sit on a rock.  I think you're missing the big point here, though.  We just made a guy drive all the way to the station to sit in our lobby so we could tell him  he can't be on our show.  And that is why you guys are the best.  Some of the instant feedback.  You guys are brutal. That was unbelievable.  I was getting uncomfortable.  I was like, oh, this is nice.  This guy's pulling his act together.  It's like real sorry about it.  I'm like, OK, this is good.  This is nice. Now we're all going to make friends.  And you guys go, can't wish in the rock. 
[31:00]
 Some people actually liking the rock out of this one, saying he came off good.  I got to say he did come off sounding like a gentleman.  At least we got an explanation.  But he came off, I'm in L.A.  3000 miles away.  Yeah. And I want to hug him.  He did come off sounding like a gentleman.  We do have footage of him, you know, in our lobby behind glass trying to get into  what did he do? 
[31:30]
 You know, it's funny.  Yeah, we got into the glass.  Oh, my God. Oh, come on.  J.Moy, you're never you're never going to get work if you keep talking like that.  I just don't know. I'm fine.  They don't go on nightline.  Do we have two of the hugest cops to as backup today?  Just in case. Yeah, I heard my boys called you.  I have my local boys call you Billy Mack and Fat Phil.  I got a message from Fat Phil, the cop going, thanks for calling me Fat Phil.  Now everyone's calling me that.  Can't you change it on the radio? 
[32:00]
 OK, I'm changing it. It's FAT or Phil.  All right, Rick's coming in.  We'll get the real story now.  That was amazing. You guys have bigger balls than me.  You absolutely have bigger balls than me.  Although it's easy to say all that stuff.  You're sweating.  When you're up there behind a locked glass door.  Exactly. Exactly.  Hold on.  How about a massage?  All right, hold on. We got Rick back into the studio.  Who is at ground zero.  Jay, I wasn't behind any glass.  You were right next to him, right?  I was about two feet away from him.  Yeah. And I think I'm a drink. 
[32:30]
 Are you sweating?  I'm sweating my ass off.  I think I can see him.  I could see him like, what?  Do you want to do this on the phone?  I'm just like, yeah.  Yeah, the rock. Yeah, the rock.  Rick's sweating like Mark Fuhrman at the Million Man Mark.  I'm sweating like a freaking altar boy at a priest convention right now.  Rick's sweating like Mike Tyson at a spelling bay.  Oh my goodness.  So how did they take it? 
[33:00]
 I guess they took it okay.  Look at his voice in cage.  Rick is a wreck.  No, Jay, you got to see Rick.  I've never seen him so freaked out right now.  Look at the size of these tops. Jesus Christ.  When me and Rick are both through that.  I would rather take a picture of you with your pants down right now.  Yeah, but when that happened, when Rick and I almost threw down,  he had like this weird glimmer in his eye.  Like, yeah, like he could taste blood.  So this guy, the rock must be unbelievable. 
[33:30]
 Yeah, I was going to taste my own.  So what did they say to you after they hung up?  Well, I tried to play stupid.  I was like, so what did the guys say?  You know, like shivering and stuff.  And they're like, that's going to be it.  Mike, oh, they didn't invite you downstairs.  Oh, my God.  And he's like, no, that's it.  So it's on deaf comedy jam.  And you should have seen the guy brought with him.  Oh, this guy's built like a brick S house.  Really? 
[34:00]
 Oh.  Everyone coming to the studio, Psychomar?  Yeah, he grabbed the video camera from me.  And he's like, let me take a picture of you.  OK, only if I can get a people's elbow.  Really?  Oh, the rock might hurt you with that.  He keeps talking himself into it.  A lot of people think we should have let him in.  But no, I'm sorry.  No, I thought that you should have let him in.  But when you made your stand, you opened up an entire new room  of respect that I didn't know I had for you.  You know, if we would have been able to get 
[34:30]
 into their little event last night,  things would have been different.  But he represents the organization  that we were a little unhappy with today.  So we had to do the same thing to the rock, not let him in.  You guys have balls of steel when you're  two stories beneath gear.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And poor Rick up on the front line.  Yeah, we're not stupid.  Come on, Jay.  You know us.  But like you said, we made a stand earlier in the show  and we had a key to it no matter what. 
[35:00]
 Exactly.  That's why you're the best show.  The rock came across very well.  He explained himself.  I appreciate all that.  Thank you.  But it wasn't good enough to get him in here.  We're really hurt from yesterday.  You want me to make a prediction?  Yeah.  You know we're all afraid of the rock?  Yeah.  I have a friend that's in WWF school right now.  He's from New Zealand.  He's a Maori Indian.  Or they're like, it's not, we call them Indians,  but they're Maori warriors.  His name is Gingy.  I predict that he will kick the rock's ass. 
[35:30]
 Gingy.  Gingy.  Kick the rock's ass.  We'll look forward to it.  I like that hunk.  I like that dance.  Before everything.  He's 6'6", 320, not an outfit fat on him.  All right.  Geez.  Wow.  We'll have a guy.  We will actually have, speaking we again.  We, Opie and Anthony and friends, will have a man that  is bigger than the rock that we will feel safe standing next  to saying, well, up yours, rock. 
[36:00]
 It's our rock.  All right, Jay.  We're going to let you go because we're sweating.  You guys are so funny.  Call Priceline.  Get Shatter's 2 Pay and Talalove.  I love you guys.  Stay in touch.  All right, Jay.  Take it easy, Jay.  Thank you.  There he goes.  The talented Jay Moore.  Keep the cop in the studio.  You've got to introduce the two huge cops that  helped us out today.  My god.  This is the Opie and Anthony Security Task Force  that I brought in today.  Holy mother of pearl.  This is Mark and Tom.  They're fellow of the mine. 
[36:30]
 I would never want to mess with you guys, man.  You want to do the handcuff thing now?  No.  No.  I don't see how long it takes for these guys to come here.  That's OK.  That would have to be like a record.  Like it would just be like, boom, click, done.  Well, thank you guys.  We appreciate it.  Absolutely.  And big fans of the show?  Hopefully.  Cool.  Say hi to the guys for us, all right?  All right, we're going to take a break.  And let's hear it.  People's biceps.  Biceps.  Let's hear it for Rick for being brave enough 
[37:00]
 to be on the front lines.  I just hope Steve has on video, or Mark has on video,  the face he made when I said, no, you've  got to do this from the phone.  Yeah.  Because all of a sudden, he did the neck thing.  And he kind of looked around.  Oh, no.  The neck thing.  I was just like, oh, here it comes.  You never want the neck thing.  The instant feedback coming alive.  People not believing we actually received the people's apology.  Well, I appreciate that from him and stuff. 
[37:30]
 We really were hurt.  But we're still pissed off at the WWF.  But you've got to say, the guy came across as a gentleman.  And he explained himself very well, I think.  And that's that.  And we had to stand our ground today.  We told the WWF earlier that we would not let him in today.  And we had to stick to that.  It would still take a miracle and an act of God  to get us back on board that ship.  But I think he came across as a gentleman.  All right, man.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  OK.  I'm ready. 
[38:00]
 You guys sometimes like, piss me off, OK?  But a little, little, little bit.  1027 WNEW.  Opium Anthony afternoon.  May 2, Kalinsky morning.  The Radio Chip Midday on 1027 WNEW.  All right, we're back.  It's the Opium Anthony Show, 1027 WNEW.  What a day we've had today, huh?  Woo!  A lot of crap hitting the fan today.  Yeah.  Phone line, 212-757-1027. 
[38:30]
 Phones are just burning up, Anthony.  Let's start with Fernando.  Fernando, what's going on today?  Hey, hey, hey.  What's up, guys?  All right.  Listen, man, you guys got a lot of respect for me, guys.  You guys did the right thing.  I don't know who's telling you guys did the bad thing.  You should have let them in there.  No, you know, we have our fans, too, that expect us  to act in a certain way.  And that's it.  I mean, we couldn't, in a good conscience, let him in here. 
[39:00]
 I do appreciate his apology.  And he, like I said, came off sounding like a true gentleman.  And like he was genuinely sorry for leaving the show the way  he did last time.  And he also put his point across why he was pissed off.  And that's all fine and well.  But we couldn't have him come down here and sit on the show  and just talk like there was no problem.  You know?  I think a better apology would be  if he had dedicated a match to you guys on live TV. 
[39:30]
 That'll seem too much like a bit.  Yeah.  It's seen a bit.  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  I think you guys are.  We don't want to see an end to it.  You know, how does the line go?  You should take that award you guys got.  Yeah.  Sign it up real nice.  Yeah.  I'll take it straight up his candy ass.  All right, Fernando.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  I was actually hoping for a while  that he was going to mouth off and kind of be nasty or something  so we really could have laid into him.  But he threw me by the way he was on the phone.  Yeah.  He was really being a nice guy and everything. 
[40:00]
 Well, we kind of liked you.  I was hoping he would rip Rick a new ass up there  and we'd get some good footage of some entrails and stuff,  you know?  Rip Rick's head right off his body  and take a dump right down his neck there.  Richie, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  All right.  I would like to welcome you two gentlemen back  from Pussyville, USA.  Here's the manhood.  You guys kicked his rear end today, man.  That was great.  Wow.  How does it feel to be strong instead of weak?  Well, like Jay Moore said, he was two floors up. 
[40:30]
 Yeah.  Anthony, come on.  You're feeling like a big tough guy now, aren't you?  No, we just had a principal.  We didn't kick his ass or anything.  We made a stand and we had to stick with it.  That's all.  The only way to bring a big man down  is to be power and number one like you guys later.  All right, man.  And we did tell the WF not to bring him by,  so it wasn't like a huge surprise to everyone here.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, first of all, congratulations on the award. 
[41:00]
 Oh, award winning, Opie and Anthony.  Hey, but who the hell else are they going to give it to,  right?  No.  You know?  I know.  We were trying to think of our combination.  Mad dog.  Well, hmm.  Well, you could give it to me for doing  that 92-minute rack black.  Oh, that goofball.  Forget that.  Hey, listen, man.  It almost seemed during the little rock conversation  that you guys were almost like backing down.  It almost seemed like you guys were kind of happy to have  the rack.  I mean, am I right or wrong?  No, like I said, it was he threw me by the way  he reacted on the phone. 
[41:30]
 I thought when we said that when Rick went up there  and gave him the phone and said, no, you're  going to call downstairs to the studio and talk to the guys,  I thought he was really going to come off  being a tough guy and F you guys and stuff.  So it kind of threw me, at least,  that he reacted like that right off the get go.  Now, I could go home today knowing  that I feel good about our performance today.  You really buy the apology, though, seriously?  They did have a week.  You guys gave them an open chance  to call back in the next day.  They basically blew you guys off till they figured 
[42:00]
 how pissed off you were.  I think he did speak with some people.  And there is a company line that he has to follow.  They know which side their bread is buttered on.  I mean, we have a lot of listeners  that they seek to have as their audience when  they're here in New York.  So they're not stupid.  I think there were some genuine things there  and what the rock was saying.  And we're not stupid.  We can't make or break the WWF.  But you know what?  I mean, we're not going to be talking about them for a while. 
[42:30]
 Well, that's perfectly good with me.  Because I mean, we were really pissed about last night.  We looked like idiots.  Yeah, we just looked like lame-os.  Hey, you made up for it.  F like us.  Thank you, Bill.  The best part is everyone going, ah!  The best part was everyone else online going,  hey, aren't you opening Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're here online.  We're online with you guys.  That's cool.  We'll all go in.  We'll have fun.  I'll have a drink with you.  Please disperse.  Please disperse.  Leave. 
[43:00]
 Aw.  It was like, Vince McMahon has told you two  to get out of here.  Aw, come on.  We looked stupid.  We really did.  Vince, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, you scared me for a second.  I'm like, did you think it was Vince McMahon?  Oh, that's coming.  Vince McMahon.  What's up, Vince?  I just want to give you guys the awards from,  hopefully I represent the people.  You guys are the new People's Tag Team champions.  It was a handicap match.  A handicap telephone match. 
[43:30]
 You took the People's album, you shoved it up his candy ass,  you let him know where you stand.  And I applaud you guys.  You guys are the best.  I was just scared for Rick's life  when we said, you know what, in good consciousness,  we really can't have you down here today.  Well, it's better, Rick, than you guys.  Poor Rick.  Look at him.  I've never seen Rick so freaked out in my life.  It's kind of nice to see.  All right, Vince.  All right, you guys suck.  Thank you.  Let's move right into what did we learn on the Ovi Anthony  show today.  All right.  We covered a lot of things today. 
[44:00]
 2127571027.  Rick, you have something?  I have what did I learn today?  That I can wet myself in front of other people.  And have it on video tape.  That'll soon be on the website.  Let's start with Mark.  Mark, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  Well, something that we've all known for a long, long time.  You cannot curse on the radio.  Right.  But if you are the rock and the people's champ, the a-hole  word will come out and you will not get dumped. 
[44:30]
 Well, we dumped out of a couple words he said.  I think it's all in context.  And you know, people, just the mood in the  studio at the time.  Like, I can turn around and say, Opie's being a real  asshole.  OK, you probably shouldn't say that.  But in that context, I wouldn't dump out.  Maybe John just did.  I don't know.  But you can say, the rock shoved it up my, and then use  the word.  Yeah, that's right.  Because then you're using it as the actual thing. 
[45:00]
 Right.  See that, people?  A little lesson on radio.  One more thing, guys.  Yeah, Mark?  Thanks for making our show number one.  Hey, thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  You heard that, Ed?  Yes, our show.  We like that.  The People's Radio Show.  I'm the Anthony, and this is the Opie over here.  Hey, George.  What's up?  What do you say?  Now, Mark, what did you learn today?  I learned that the rock does a great Grease Man impression.  Apologize.  Got it, people? 
[45:30]
 What a doodle.  The rock apologizes.  All right, you can begin now, guys.  You can begin now.  Thank you, George.  I'm sorry I walked off the show.  I apologize.  Sniilin' yada doodle.  What a doodle.  It's the Rock Men's Show.  We pause for these words.  We'll be back with more of the Rock Men apology after this.  What a doodle.  Bone dry, bone dry, yeah, people's elbow, yeah.  Mike, what's going on? 
[46:00]
 Hey, what's up, Owen and Ed?  All right.  You know what I learned on the show today?  I learned revenge is best served up cold.  Oh, very nice.  You guys have the people's cojones, brother.  Oh, thank you.  You guys rule.  All right, thank you.  All right, later.  Bye.  Old dirty real fast?  Uh-oh.  All right.  Old dirty, you learned it?  Ah, you rock.  What's with old dirty?  He must have finished off a whole 40. 
[46:30]
 Yeah, bro.  You did a pussy out, which is like, that's what I expected  from my brothers, man.  You know what I'm saying?  Beautiful, bro, beautiful.  They don't let nobody take you for no pussy.  You guys are the big boys on the block now.  You're taking over the corner, you know?  You got to establish your ground.  You got to let these people start treating you  with a little respect, man.  We don't ask for much.  No, we don't.  You know what I'm saying?  Hello?  Yeah, we're listening to you.  Wait, here you go. 
[47:00]
 What are you all, wound up?  Yo, wound up.  You got me wound up, kid.  Word up.  You great, man.  Yo.  All right.  Oh, man, how they going to diss the lady Sandy and Mr.  Opie?  You guys should have walked right in, you know?  We were going to have a WWF.  We always have it, you know, to see SmackDown and stuff.  Yeah.  And I put the paper view and all that?  Yeah.  I'm told turned off by the whole thing.  Yo, you diss them all the way, bro.  I'm not even going to watch tonight, man.  No, to be honest, I mean, you know, 
[47:30]
 we just stopped talking about it after today.  We said that.  You know what I'm saying?  Vince McMahon, his lips, stretched from Stanford  all the way to 57.  Yo, rock.  Yo, this awesome kid.  All right, Odie.  That's my word.  We feel pretty good about what happened.  And yo, don't let nobody diss our people, man.  Our radio shows, son.  All right, got it, man.  All right?  We'll see you tomorrow, all right?  All right, baby.  Peace.  There he goes, old dirty.  Very happy today, Anthony.  Yes.  Tom, you're next on the show.  What'd you learn? 
[48:00]
 What's up, Odie?  I learned that their invitation to WWF is just fake  as they're wrestling.  Maybe that's it.  What are we expecting?  That's true.  Look, I got the invitation here.  It's a fake.  Fake.  Very good, Tom.  Thanks.  You guys suck.  All right.  Let's try to get a bunch of calls.  Make it fast if you're calling in.  Tommy, what's up?  What'd you learn?  Not much, guys.  Congratulations, by the way.  All right.  I just wanted to say we received the people's apology,  and we reciprocated with the people's F-U, Rock. 
[48:30]
 Have a good night, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Line nine.  Wow.  All right.  Andrew, you're next.  What'd you learn on the show today?  I learned that you guys still care too much about Rick  to play those damn songs for the Rock.  That would have put him over the top, man.  It was too serious to break out the Rock songs today.  I would have loved that, though.  That would have been great.  All right.  Thank you. 
[49:00]
 Oh, my god.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, bye.  It would look like King Kong with Dave Rea.  Drew, you're next.  What'd you learn on the show today?  I learned that Howard Stern is an unfunny, big-nosed, washed-up,  self-pitying, pussy-whipped bastard.  Wow.  I couldn't even use your names when he's whining about you  guys doing original acts.  The big F you to the Rock and the WWF.  I love you guys.  All right.  Thank you, Drew.  Let's see.  We're not even screened.  Greg, what's up?  What'd you learn?  How you doing? 
[49:30]
 Good.  I learned where Howard's party is going to be tomorrow.  Rosedale Theater, right?  And also that you guys are psychic.  All right.  Thank god he didn't say the name,  because we got in so much trouble saying that earlier.  Jack, you should shut up.  I had to hang up on Greg, because we got a lot of trouble  for saying that earlier.  Thank god he didn't have the right name.  Dave, what's going on?  I learned that your balls grow three times in size  when you're behind a locked door. 
[50:00]
 Yeah, how true.  We're not going to deny it.  And that Earl shouldn't be flying in the street.  All right.  Very good.  OK.  Later.  Thank you.  One for Rick here.  Frank, what'd you learn on the show today?  Guys, Rick wins the Balls of Titanium of the Millennium Award  to stand it up to the Rock.  Can you imagine poor Rick was up there two feet away  while we're telling the Rocky King to come back?  Yeah, you guys are protected wherever you are.  And he's like right in front of him.  That was absolutely amazing. 
[50:30]
 He had the red carpet treatment at the restaurant.  Everyone wanted to talk to the Rock.  Yeah.  Pulls up in his lip, mom.  You guys started off slow.  You started off like two pans.  He's in the dean's office.  But you nailed him at the end there  when you didn't invite him up.  That was great.  All right, cool.  Fantastic job, guys.  Thank you.  You guys suck.  We do want to just attack him to attack him.  I mean, you know.  Absolutely not.  He explained himself.  That's all we were looking for.  What a frigging show today.  Jesus Christ. 
[51:00]
 Lots going on.  All right.  I'm waiting for Spass to scream more of these.  Danielle, what's going on?  Hey.  Hi.  Guess what I learned?  I learned that Anthony, once Anthony's ex-wife is done with him,  prison will be a cakewalk.  He needs to drop his pants and bend over.  What?  Wow.  I think she said when your divorce is over.  She's going to screw you early, man.  Oh, really?  Prison's going to be a cakewalk.  Bend over and drop your pants now.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Thanks. 
[51:30]
 Hey, Lou, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, I learned that I've become a huge WCW fan.  Rick Flair.  Woo!  I'm not going to go that far.  Yeah, really?  All right.  No matter how much we don't get along with the WWF,  I can't swallow that swill over there.  Bridget, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, this is Bridget from yesterday.  When we played Make Bridget Cry yesterday. 
[52:00]
 How are you today, Bridget?  I'm OK.  How's the back of your head, horse?  So any more hand prints on your forehead and tile floor marks  on the back of your head?  Huh?  After hearing the way you guys treated the rock,  I learned I'm not the only one who got treated like a whore.  Oh, my.  Oh.  Hey, I sent you guys my photos on YouTube.  You got the people's penis is what you got, honey. 
[52:30]
 You send pictures of yourself to us?  Yeah.  OK, we'll check them out.  You should be on the unofficial website, Steve,  from the unofficial website in the studio.  Steve, grab a mic real fast.  No, no, no, I can't.  Why not?  Please.  I can't.  Why not?  I can't.  I can't.  No, you fling yourself.  Oh, wait a minute.  That was you?  I think I just saw her pictures.  Really?  Really.  Bridget photos.  Let me say, please hold.  Well, I mean, you don't have to do it, but Steve's in the studio.  He's looking for more girls to send in pictures 
[53:00]
 to the unofficial Opiate Anthony website.  There's a section called the girls of the ONA show.  Girls of the ONA.  And so far, we have one skanky broad that's saying pictures.  Which one are you?  Good thing you're not on totally.  I think that's where she lived.  OK, you look like, well, that's you.  All right.  Hey, that ain't bad.  Turn around.  You kind of look like Tiffany.  Let me see.  Which one are you, the one on the left?  The one on the left?  The one on the left?  I'm not looking at a computer.  Wait, the darker red hair? 
[53:30]
 Yeah, the other one's got like blonde hair.  Your pal there?  Yeah.  That's my friend.  So that's you in the little white dress?  Yeah.  Check it out.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, some guy dumped you?  That ain't bad.  I didn't recognize it without the lights.  It can't go on the website, OK?  Oh, really?  Yeah, we're not allowed to do it if you don't want it to be  there, so all right.  Bye, guys.  I love you.  All right, we'll talk to you soon, OK?  OK, bye.  Bye.  Let's finish up the show here. 
[54:00]
 Kevin, what'd you learn on the show today?  Yeah, how are you?  It's just Opiate Anthony.  Both of us.  It doesn't matter who it is, sis.  The Rock's double on, baby.  All right, very good.  Just to prove we're not screening the calls today,  because last time we were accused of that after The Rock  left.  No, just push them down.  Eric, what's going on?  I learned that The Rock is a pebble.  Have a good one, guys.  All right, man.  Just about done.  Chris, what are you doing? 
[54:30]
 Hey, guys, it's good to have you.  I learned the best way to lose all your possessions  is to get married.  Yeah.  That's really tough.  I'm never going to do it.  Take care, guys.  I've got to go.  All right, thank you.  Steve, you're next.  What'd you learn on the show today?  Hey, Opiate Anthony, one thing I learned today  is definitely never get married.  Yeah.  And number two, I got to call you guys jerks  for not walking to the front of the line last night.  You guys should have got in there, man.  No problem.  Now we tried.  Nah.  You guys are big time, man.  Oh, yeah.  We never waited on the line.  Oh, we really felt big time last night. 
[55:00]
 We went to the front of the line.  They made us feel very welcome, very good over there.  Did that WWF?  Well, listen, I called you guys once before.  I'm a Stone Cold Steve Austin lookalike,  and I got a great sign made up for you guys.  So look for me at the Royal Rumble, all right?  And I hope you guys change your feeling  to WWF, because I still love them, too.  That's got his own music.  What a tool.  Jesus Christ, that's funny.  That's very funny.  Mike, you're next.  What'd you learn on the show today? 
[55:30]
 I learned that WWF would do anything  to get you back on their good side.  They don't make the rock come down and cry  and be a pussy in front of you guys.  The rock's crying.  Look, the people's tears are going down the people's cheeks.  And guys, can I have your tickets?  No, we ripped up the wrestling tickets.  You ripped them up.  None more tickets.  None more.  OK.  All right, Mike.  Can't blame you guys.  Thanks.  Bye.  Let's end with one more here.  Matt?  Yeah, I learned that Opie and Anthony have got the balls  to put the map of Hawaii all over the WWF. 
[56:00]
 That and you guys won't be giving away wrestling tickets  any time soon.  No, no, that won't be happening.  No, I didn't think so.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  Later.  OK.  Well, I think we're done for today.  Yeah, looks that way, huh?  Crazy, crazy day.  Opie, let me congratulate you on the 1999 New York Metro Air  Award Best Afternoon Radio Show. 
[56:30]
 Bravo.  Now you kiss my ass and we're done.  And congratulations to Anthony.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good job.  Well done.  I'm getting a back rub.  That's why I'm just trying to congratulate you.  But yes, the award-winning Opie and Anthony show.  Much to the chagrin of the radio industry,  we walked away with the Best Afternoon Radio Show.  And boy, was the room pissed. 
[57:00]
 Ben and Earl got up and accepted the award.  And the people were just horrified.  It was like Adolf Hitler going up  to accept the humanitarian award.  Yeah, pretty much.  They were just horrified.  The CBS FM table, heads in their hands.  Right.  Pissed.  Thank God.  Because if they would have applauded and been happy for it,  we would have known that we sucked.  But maybe it was a joke. 
[57:30]
 The whole award thing?  Yeah, maybe they went like, let's give it to Opie and Anthony.  Well, we're thankful.  Thank you very much.  I would have turned it into a bong.  Get it drilled out and stuff.  That's a good carburetor.  All right, we'll see you guys tomorrow for FU Friday.  Thanks for listening.  We appreciate it.  If you're out there in the slop, take your time.  You'll make it home eventually.  All right?  All right.  Opie and Anthony, we punish ignorance. 
[58:00]
 Hey, ass, turn down your radio.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
