<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous recap of the NFL playoff games, specifically the Ravens-Patriots and Giants-49ers matchups.  Opie and Anthony, along with studio personnel including “Dr. Gay,” a Ravens fan, and caller Walt, provided vulgar and sexually suggestive commentary on the games, focusing on controversial plays, player performances, and fan reactions.  Their discussion included a tangent on a local news segment about healthy eating during football games, a scathing critique of Steven Tyler’s National Anthem performance, and a debate on the loyalty of Jets fans forced to choose between the Giants and Patriots in the Super Bowl.  They also briefly recounted an encounter with Alan Alda, referencing the sitcom *MASH*, before playing audio clips of the games' final moments, sparking further crude commentary.

A phone call with sports radio host Mike Francesa followed. While ostensibly discussing the Giants' Super Bowl prospects, Francesa veered into speculation about Joe Paterno's health and death, ultimately declaring his usual radio bit ineffective. The hosts then discussed an impending snowstorm before surprisingly introducing Jesse Ventura, who offered a brief, humorous aside about the Patriots.  This transitioned into E-Rock's music trivia segment, marked by E-Rock’s struggles and humorous banter with the hosts, culminating in Rick Derringer's "Real American" for Hulk Hogan's anniversary.  The conversation returned to sports, including the Super Bowl and Jets fans' surprising support for the Giants, along with a recollection of a past encounter with Bob Kraft and the Patriots, and a discussion of Tim Tebow's career and religious displays.  The broadcast also featured a discussion of a viral video of extreme sports stunts on an icy ridge.

A substantial portion of the show was devoted to the Penn State child sex abuse scandal and Joe Paterno's role. The hosts engaged in heated debates with numerous callers, expressing outrage at Paterno's perceived inaction.  A caller identifying as an attorney running for the Penn State Board of Trustees argued that Paterno reported the abuse to the police, claiming the delay was due to the timing of the call and that Paterno fully cooperated with the investigation, suggesting the university's actions were politically motivated.  This claim was challenged by other callers and the hosts, who highlighted Sandusky's continued presence in the program after the initial report.  The discussion included ethical responsibilities of reporting child abuse,  hypothetical scenarios presented to a nurse caller, and comparisons to the controversies surrounding Roman Polanski and Mel Gibson.  The hosts repeatedly emphasized the severity of the abuse and their disbelief in the attorney's account.  The segment concluded with further analysis of the university's handling of the situation and speculation on the motivations of those involved.

The Sandusky scandal discussion continued with a heated exchange between the hosts and a caller named Cameron, who accused them of factual inaccuracies regarding Paterno’s actions and knowledge.  The hosts countered with their own research and interpretations, leading to an escalating exchange of insults.  The segment also featured the repeated playing of a song requested by "Bobo Man," described as extremely awful and repetitive, interspersed with vulgar banter about sex, physical attributes and other inappropriate topics.   There was a brief discussion of the Shorty Awards, with the hosts campaigning for votes, followed by a discussion and playing of a song from a Chinese New Year celebration featuring Shaq, which caused amusement.  The show concluded with the hosts promoting upcoming appearances and contests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Dopey and Agni Show, their followers are violent extremists.  I would have ripped this cock off!  They use every derogatory term on the planet, but they can't argue or debate.  You're a waste of life, you fucking pig!  The Dopey and Agni Show is a slut machine.  You have lovely, giant breasts.  My nipples are kind of hard right now.  Fuck yeah!  They were like little lizards licking at their foots.  That's what they done.  It's fucking brilliant.  The Dopey and Agni Show, they breed violent extremists. 
[00:00:30]  They call that humor for some reason.  Welcome to the program!  These people are not part of the human race.  These are anti-human.  They suck a tits or something.  That's what they're all about.  Picking out the most vulnerable in society.  Junkie, dunkie, fat, fat!  How dare you question the Dopey and Agni Show?  Get used to it, man.  Let's go fucking have a good time, you know what I mean?  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning! 
[00:01:00]  Morning!  Morning, morning, morning, morning.  How is everybody on this?  Ain't it a fine morning?  It is a good morning.  Yeah.  It's nice and warm again.  Yeah.  After a cold weekend, I guess.  Cold weekend.  What happened?  A little snow in New York City.  Yeah, we did have a little taste of the old winter precipitation.  Finally.  Yeah.  It wasn't that bad.  It was just a little bit.  Not too inconvenient.  Made everything look nice.  Nice for a couple hours.  Yeah, I don't mind that.  As long as it goes away within, you know, five, six hours. 
[00:01:30]  Then I'm fine.  Yeah.  It's going to be a nice day in New York City.  I hope it's nice where you are today.  Yeah.  And here's the weather in your neighborhood.  Man, I'm fucking tired from watching football.  Did you watch both games?  Did I watch?  In trierty?  Did I watch?  I absolutely watched.  Yeah?  I got to start.  I got up early on the weekends because the kid in local news was doing a piece called, 
[00:02:00]  and I couldn't wait to just say this on the air, how to eat healthy during the football  games.  They actually had a fucking news piece on this.  How to eat healthy.  Why?  And one of the tips was, hang out with the talkers, not the eaters.  Who the fuck?  That means the women.  Hang out with the women.  But who the fuck?  Hang out with the women.  Who the fuck with your guy friends and having fun eating chips and what's that?  Right.  And pretzels.  Right.  Hang out with your fucking chicks.  Right.  Hang out with the talkers, not the eaters. 
[00:02:30]  Are you kidding me?  This is what the news is doing.  Who the fuck eats healthy during a football game?  Unfortunately, you don't.  But it's not like it's all the time.  You're just packing it in.  But the people that maybe need to eat healthy are not paying attention to the news as they do  this stupid piece.  I like to eat healthy, but I certainly throw that out the window when football's on.  And the guys that maybe really need to look at their diets and stuff, they're not going  to fucking start their diets during a football game? 
[00:03:00]  No.  And eat celery and carrots?  You wait until after the Super Bowl and then your football bad dieting is...  Just nonsense.  I call it nonsense TV.  They just have to fill up time, I guess.  Nonsense.  Oh my God.  Congratulations to the...  My Giants?  Woo!  Yeah!  Big blue!  Man, I was like, after this whole season of just following the Giants, making... 
[00:03:30]  And then they barely got into the playoffs.  Yep.  And now we're Super Bowl bound.  We are Super Bowl bound!  No one's going to buy it.  You haven't talked about football all year.  That's how I roll, though, because I don't want to jinx it.  But at home, I am Mr. Giant.  You like to go for the front runner?  I got the big blue Giants rug on my floor in my man cave.  In my gaping man cave. 
[00:04:00]  Where you at with man caves?  Hate the man cave.  No chicks allowed!  This is where we go, man!  Man!  And the bottom line with a man cave is, it's where your wife said you can go in the house.  Correct the moon, though.  Yeah, no, I make this shit and I tell her, fuck you!  My friends are coming in the man cave and it's all men and you sit out there with your coffee clutch.  We're going in here.  What do you say to the people that go, but Anthony, you gotta see my man cave.  It's pretty cool, you know.  I see your man cave.  I spent thousands of dollars on it. 
[00:04:30]  You're relegated to a room that she allowed you to fucking put a TV and some beers in.  And a fucking Giants rug and some fucking pictures on the wall.  Yeah, but they watch porn during halftime.  No, they don't.  In the man cave!  They don't watch porn.  You gotta come down there and give him a talking to.  They like the Bud Light chick bowl.  Like, that's their idea of sexies.  The lingerie bowl.  Yeah.  The lingerie bowl, like, you know, they don't get too crazy with the porn.  Oh, no. 
[00:05:00]  Just a little lingerie bowl.  Just a little lingerie bowl.  Look at that.  Yeah, she pretty.  My wife's upstairs.  Keep it down, honey.  You want to get me in trouble?  Whoa, the man cave.  Nothing going on down here, honey.  Nothing you want to know about anyway.  How about you get us some more wings?  I'll come to the top of the stairs and grab them.  Hey, look at that.  Yeah.  Hey, Bobby's sucking Vinny's dick down here.  It's a man cave.  Yeah, he's getting Fritos in his ass cheeks from the fucking season. 
[00:05:30]  The man cave concept has taken off, but I never understood it myself.  Oh, no.  You know, enjoy your man cave, I guess.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, when I have people over for a football game, we all kind of just watch.  Yeah, you just watch.  It doesn't have to be this separate.  And guess what?  A few people might not want to watch the football game, whether it's guys, girls, whatever.  They go somewhere else and check out something else for a while.  Yeah, that's where, you know, the other kitchen's for it.  And I'm not saying you need a huge place.  That's where the talkers are.  Yeah, the talkers. 
[00:06:00]  The talkers.  Go find them.  And that's bullshit, because I'll tell you what, where the talkers are hanging out is  normally in the kitchen.  When the sport's going on in the living room, the kitchen is where the talkers are.  And there's always shit out in the kitchen.  And, you know, dips and chips and what's that and, you know, all kinds of stuff.  I throw out my healthy eating when the football games are on.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I should have freaking emailed the guys, because now I want to play the clip on the air, because 
[00:06:30]  it was so stupid.  I'm sitting there going, what?  Right.  You have nothing else to talk about?  Anyway, uh, fuck, 49ers!  Damn it!  Man, uh...  That was my team.  I picked them early.  You know that.  Oh, yes, yes.  You did.  You know I picked them early.  I really liked how they were playing this year.  Well, I guess people have called me out.  I guess I gotta fess up.  I'm truly, you know, not a big Giants fan.  But I did watch the game.  I did watch the game. 
[00:07:00]  Did you really watch?  Yeah, I did.  They were two great games.  That was a-tweeting and a-watching.  Yeah.  And, uh, wow, man, there's, uh, some...  I bet the hardcore San Francisco fans, you know how that feels.  You know how that feels, and it's like, oh, but all we had to do...  Oh, but the...  And that was a big fuck-up.  That was a big fuck-up.  Same guy fucked up twice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, he fumbled?  What else did he do?  No, it touched his knee.  That ball, it touched his knee, but barely. 
[00:07:30]  But the fumble, yeah, deep in their territory.  Or the muffed fucking...  Well, in overtime, sure.  The muffed fucking...  In overtime, giving Eli Manning a chance.  Yep.  And that became...  I like when it became...  Now, just hold on to the ball.  Right.  That's pretty much the game right there.  Right.  Just hold on to the fucking ball.  Why would you take a chance?  I would have just kicked the field goal right away.  At first down.  Right.  First down, kick the field goal.  More or less a chip shot, so...  Why are you risking anything? 
[00:08:00]  Yes.  Why are you risking anything at this point?  Yeah.  Ah, the fucking 49ers were that close.  They were 6-10 last year.  Yeah.  That would have been a hell of a turnaround.  And then they're in the Super Bowl with a new coach?  They would have got murdered, though, by the...  Pass.  Yeah.  They killed them.  I have to say it right now.  I have to go Patriots.  Yeah.  And I'm not fucking around with some stupid sports curse.  Well, that's the worst time is when you're not fucking...  I can't root for the Giants.  I cannot do it. 
[00:08:30]  I'm a Jets fan.  People are like, oh, man, but New York, man.  Yeah, but the problem is when the Giants...  If the Giants win the Super Bowl, next year I get shit all year.  Ha, ha.  Ha.  Our team won, and your New York team sucks.  Well, Opie, I'm looking down here.  The cheers that are coming in from the Giants fans, and the fuck yous that are coming in  from the Patriots fans.  Why, man?  I'm with the Patriots.  I would love to see Tom Brady fucking win another Super Bowl.  It's not a guarantee. 
[00:09:00]  I'm not even...  I'm not joking.  That's what I want.  But that's just it.  And it's not a guarantee every time you do this, the team loses.  But you do have a particular track record of maybe jinxing the team you root for.  Honestly, the last two weeks, I was just 50-50.  Yeah?  Yeah, I was 50-50.  Yeah.  But these are the big games, though.  I picked the Patriots and the 49ers over the weekend.  I was 50-50.  And the week before, I was 50-50.  I'd like to see what your stats are when it's a big game.  We're talking World Series, Stanley Cup, Super Bowl, whatever they call the basketball thing. 
[00:09:30]  I think the record will state I've never picked a Super Bowl winner.  Oh, shit!  I think the record will state.  All right.  Go fast.  I think E-Rock could possibly look back the last few years.  Beat a fucking horse?  What?  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  I finished your answer and was wrong.  I believe I have not picked a Super Bowl winner ever.  Wow.  And it all started when I was doing radio in Buffalo.  And they lost the Super Bowl four years in a row while I was up there. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And it never got better.  And then when we were in Boston, the Pats lost.  I don't think I've ever picked a Super Bowl winner.  I really don't think so.  But you know what?  All those strings, when you string something together like that, it ends someday.  Don't worry.  So this might be it.  Yeah, this will be it.  This will be it.  Of course, a lot of people, from what I heard, willy-nilly just over the past few days,  apparently Pats defense not as good as it has been in the past and not good this season. 
[00:10:30]  Am I correct here?  Some people would say, sure.  Okay.  Tom Brady had a shitty game yesterday, so he'll step it up for the Super Bowl.  They were one field goal away from at least overtime.  Yeah.  The Ravens.  And the Ravens fucked that up.  And we got a huge Ravens fan that works for us.  Travis is a really big-time Ravens fan.  But he being gay negates that whole thing.  Dr. Gay!  He is...  No one's in there to play along with him.  I know.  Sam ran out, but he's laughing right now. 
[00:11:00]  Travis is...  He's laughing.  Travis is miserable.  First of all, why a Ravens fan again?  I'm from Baltimore.  Baltimore.  Oh, I thought you were from Canada.  No.  Oh, his wife is.  He's from Baltimore.  He's like the wire.  He was all hardcore and shit.  Yeah.  He used to say car like core.  Who'd you like before the Ravens?  You know, I really wasn't...  Gay then?  Well, yeah.  I mean, like I lived in Florida, so I guess I...  Did you grow up with E-Rock?  No, surprisingly no.  I didn't live in the rich community that Eric had in. 
[00:11:30]  Competing high schools down there?  You and E-Rock?  So I kind of rooted for Tampa Bay just because that's where I lived.  Oh, the Buccaneers.  Wow.  They don't have any fans.  Literally, I don't think they have one fan at this point.  So it was good when Baltimore got a team.  Yeah.  Hey, Sam.  Dr. Gay is contributing to some of the football talk.  Dr. Gay!  Thanks, man.  I was alone.  So, Travis, you should be going to the Super Bowl.  You know that, right?  Your team.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:12:00]  And I think Jimmy said that drop pass was way...  That was tough.  That's the real reason.  Yeah.  Terrible.  You can blame...  There's a lot of things.  You can blame Cundiff all you want, but...  He marched the fucking team down.  Threw the ball in the end zone.  Flacco did a great job.  I know a defender knocked it away, but not really.  It was a pretty good defensive play.  It was dropped.  But you think he should have grabbed it?  I know he should have.  Yeah, absolutely.  You think he should have held on to that ball?  He knows he should have, too.  He poked it out nice, Jimmy. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, he did.  He should have held on to the ball.  Nice.  You think?  That's the difference between not going to the Super Bowl and going to the Super Bowl.  He said, I'm not holding that fucking ball.  Yeah, he should have held it.  And Travis is saying they should have taken that timeout because it was all willy-nilly.  Everyone's rushing around and then...  Well, yeah.  When you're running onto the field with 10 seconds left, of course you take a timeout.  Right.  When you're about to kick the biggest field goal of the season.  Why didn't they?  I don't know.  And they don't know either.  They're just saying, well...  Because they were too scared the other team was going to call the timeout to freeze the kicker. 
[00:13:00]  But you've got 10 seconds of the kicker.  But at that point, it's in your favor to call the timeout.  Right.  Just call the timeout.  That was terrible.  The coach panicked.  It was awful.  That's what happened in the Giants game.  There was a couple of missteps there before the field goal.  The Giants.  And nobody wanted to win that game.  Huh?  Nobody wanted to win that Giants game.  That really was fucked up.  First, they ran out the play clock.  And the coach is just like, what?  Well, he had his big...  What?  Coughlin had his big fucking headphones on.  He can't hear nothing.  Are they put out, by the way, by Motorola? 
[00:13:30]  I think they are.  I wasn't quite sure.  I think you might be right on that.  Yeah.  And then, of course, they line up to kick now.  Penalized five yards.  And then...  That timeout!  Timeout!  That always cracks me up.  But you're sitting there at that point looking like, is this going to fuck him up?  Right.  Is he going to hook that fucking thing?  I think a kicker is on the field a total of 40 seconds.  That's his job.  And sometimes it's very important. 
[00:14:00]  The entire game, I think it's 40 seconds, if that much, of playing time.  Yeah.  What a weird job.  It really is.  You just sit there.  Waiting.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  All right.  It's up to you.  Right.  To see if you could kick the winning field goal.  Yeah.  And you pretty much do nothing the entire game.  Do you think he's sitting there at the point...  What a weird life.  At the point when the Giants had the ball and they're, you know, just a few...  We're in the 20.  Right.  Do you think he's sitting there going, God, I just hope he tosses it in there and I never 
[00:14:30]  even got to leave the bench?  Oh, of course.  It's just, I just don't know.  I want to leave the bench.  I just want to...  I want to go, woo!  Of course.  Yeah.  I think, yeah.  I think they'd rather see, you know, them winning another one.  Not have to be on their back.  Yeah, man.  It's like, oh, I'm going to make...  I'm either going to make this and we're going to go to the Super Bowl or I am going to make  a history-making highlight clip that they're going to just play over and over.  But what does the kicker do?  He just walks around.  Yeah.  Keeps his leg warm. 
[00:15:00]  I think he could get chicks.  They're notorious weirdos, too.  Yeah, they're like the weird guys.  You have to be.  They're the geek of the team.  Do you think they just whistle some songs?  Like, what do they do?  They probably don't want to be talked to before.  No one is allowed to talk to them.  They got to kick into that net.  Brr!  Well, that's...  Brr!  They only do that a few times, though.  No, that's true.  Because they don't want to do that too much because they don't want to tire out their footsie.  No.  That was a real...  It was kind of a bad snap, too.  It was a low snap and...  Yeah, they handled it.  Like, he got it, and that was the second he fucking straightened that out. 
[00:15:30]  That's when he was able to kick it.  So we got the big...  That was pretty good.  The big game.  Are we allowed to say Super Bowl?  I'm saying we are the official, the official show of the big game.  Now, let's say we are the official satellite radio show of the Super Bowl.  Wow, we're in trouble.  Let's get that out there.  We are.  Let's get that out there.  Yes.  Yeah?  Yes.  Let's get that out there immediately.  All right.  To the press.  Cool.  Can't wait for the C&D to show up. 
[00:16:00]  It's the over-under.  And I guess the Super Bowl is a do-over?  Do-over.  Do-over.  Yeah.  Shit.  Which is funny because the Drudge Report put up a picture of...  Who was it?  Tom Brady talking to Eli Manning.  No, that was the second one they had, right?  They fixed it.  Oh.  It was Peyton.  They had Peyton Manning he was talking to at first.  That was the picture they had.  They had a running score on the Drudge Report.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got the big rematch, so that's pretty exciting for football fans in general. 
[00:16:30]  I just hope it's a humiliation for the Giants.  Really?  I hate the fucking Giants more than any team in sports.  I go Patriots.  Dertrid.  Yeah?  Jimmy goes Patriots.  I think anybody.  And goes Big Blue.  Al-Qaeda.  I would take over the Giants.  Wow.  How's their team this year?  Not too good.  Their balls are all notoriously smelly.  The cheerleaders are all declitted.  And they just kind of politely clap and make...  As if they don't get stoned. 
[00:17:00]  What happened the last time these two teams played?  Refresh everyone's memory.  I believe the Giants won.  It was the catch.  It was the catch.  The catch.  I'm sorry.  It was more than a catch.  It was more than a catch.  I'm sure it was more than a catch.  Opie, if you read the book, you'll know it was more than a catch.  I know exactly what happened.  I just wanted someone else to say it.  That's hilarious.  Was it more than a catch?  I think it was.  It was.  What year was that?  That's like...  More than a catch.  And that was the big year where the Patriots were undefeated and then losing the Super Bowl. 
[00:17:30]  So Brady wants this bad.  Because then all those dumb nightmares he has to this day could go away.  Have they not won?  Because he wins the fucking rematch.  No, they haven't won since.  He's got three Super Bowls, right?  Yes.  But he hasn't had one in...  When was the last time?  What have you done for me lately?  Look down, eh?  When was the last time the Pats won?  I want to say 2005.  Opie, last time the Pats won was 2004.  2004, okay.  Yes.  Eight years since he won a Super Bowl?  Wow.  Oh, poor guy.  So he wants this.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  He wants this.  Yeah, I mean, he's going to have to play better than he did.  More than a catch, huh?  More than a catch, yeah.  That catch was ridiculous.  Yeah, but it was more than a catch.  Did he make fun of that guy?  That catch was ridiculous.  They almost had one last night.  I saw that.  Oh, that was like a...  Right off the fingertips.  And then it's almost an interception.  I saw that.  Yeah.  Whatever happened to that guy?  Where is he?  Where is that guy?  Did he play for another season with the Giants?  I think...  David Tyree.  Did he write another book? 
[00:18:30]  No, I don't think so.  Yes.  Beyond more than a catch?  No, his second book should be called...  Way more than a catch.  No, his second book should be...  I guess it was just a catch.  Yeah, I guess.  Well, I guess it was.  Because no one knows who I am, and I'm not in football anymore.  Or more than a catch, question mark.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just add a question mark for a second book.  Yeah.  More than a catch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw Alan Alda.  I texted you.  What?  I saw him in our neighborhood.  Oh, yeah?  Right after... 
[00:19:00]  Five minutes after we talked to the other day.  Literally, Kenny drops me off.  Jimmy's still in the car, and I'm pretty much bumping Alan Alda right around the corner.  And every time I see him, I see him a lot, because he lives really close to us.  I just want to do the...  Yes.  Do you say hi to him at all, or no?  No.  Is he alone, usually?  This time, was he...  See, when you see the celebrity, you don't even realize who else is with him.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think he was with somebody, if I had to guess.  Probably Loretta Swit.  Loretta Swit.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  There was a MASH marathon on yesterday, on one of those fucking channels that just play  old shows.  Yeah.  And I was laughing watching it, and not because it's a comedy, but because it's supposed  to be a comedy?  Mm-hmm.  Like, some episodes you watch, and it's just like, what the fuck is going on?  And it was the one you had recently just talked about, where he's talking to the shrink,  and he was talking about the lake, and how he almost drowned, and was it Billy?  His cousin Billy helped me into the water.  He helped me into the water. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Into the water?  Yeah.  It doesn't matter what I say.  Ah!  Why did he do that?  I hated him.  He starts crying, and it's like, where's the Ken laughs now?  Where's the Ken laughs now?  And I just turned around.  I was like, this is comedy?  Alan Arbus is very good as the shrink, too.  The shrink, yeah.  He's kind of synonymous for that one.  When you see him on any other show or movie, it's like, ah, yeah, the shrink from MASH.  The laughs don't come in MASH.  I don't laugh when I watch it. 
[00:20:30]  No, no.  Because it's more March Brother-y a little bit, but I still love the dramatic moments.  My dad used to watch it.  It was his favorite show, and growing up, I would just sit down and watch it with him,  and I would never laugh.  Never laugh.  I don't understand, like, why he liked that show at all.  Yeah, it's a little dated, some of the humor.  Horse hockey!  All right.  That's funny.  What's horse hockey?  I don't know.  That's what Harry Morgan used to yell out, and it meant nothing.  I guess it was, you know.  Instead of cursing?  When you kick the little balls of horse shit around. 
[00:21:00]  Maybe that's horse hockey you're playing.  Is he trying to get a catchphrase going?  Maybe beat your wife.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe I'm dead.  Or finger Sophie.  Finger Sophie.  She's stump broke.  I could fuck her.  Was he hoping to get horse hockey on a fucking t-shirt?  Maybe.  I guess it didn't work out.  I do catchphrases.  Not you!  The Harry Morgan catchphrase.  I could have met him.  Well, it's yours.  Huh?  Yours is still going. 
[00:21:30]  Which one?  Which one?  I got a few.  I got a few I'm trying to work.  Brother man, brother man.  Brother man, brother man.  I'm trying to work.  And I'm trying to work Dummy in a Hot Tub, even though that's Sam's, but I'm fucking pushing  that one forward, and I might have one.  That was actually off of, yeah.  Huh?  That was actually off of Pal Talk.  What?  Dummy in a Hot Tub.  So it's not even Sam's?  No, it's not even Sam's.  Oh, Sam's.  So who do I have to pay on fucking Pal Talk if I put that on a t-shirt?  I don't know.  Fuck.  I copyright wrote it already. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, Joe, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, oh, but I mean, I'm a big Jets fan, too, but you'd really go for the Patriots over  the Giants?  Let me answer your question.  Joe has nothing.  He said, what have you got?  I said, let me answer your question.  He has nothing.  Well, this is a good question, though, because the problem is, yeah, I have to do that, because  when you walk around next year, if the Giants, God forbid, win the Super Bowl, they're going 
[00:22:30]  to beat up all the Jets fans.  Point and laugh and shit.  I mean, I have to say, I hate the Patriots.  I know they're in the same division, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but it's the lesser of  two evils.  I'm sorry.  I can't jump from one New York team to the other.  I've never done it.  I might have done it with the Yankees when I was too young to understand, totally.  Did you guys see that hit in the Giant game where the guy got knocked out?  Yeah.  25, whatever.  Yeah, they ran into each other.  Well, that caused some problems, because that guy would have been in the game. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  He'd have been the guy.  He might have handled things differently.  So that was a massive play.  They put in a whoopsie.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Am I alone on this?  A lot of Jets fans have to go and root for the Giants.  It's a tough spot for Jets fans, yes.  There's not going to be a lot of Jets fans rooting for the Patriots.  No, they hate the Patriots.  But you think more Jets fans will root for the Giants?  Yes.  Yes.  If they're forced to.  99%.  Absolutely.  The fucking Boston-New York rivalry is so intense that there's no fucking way anyone but you. 
[00:23:30]  But I'm a different Jets fan, because I spent three years in Boston.  Exactly.  And I really do like Boston a lot.  I know.  I would move back there tomorrow under the right circumstances.  You don't root for a division rival ever.  I know.  I get all that ever.  I think you're right.  If there's another guy that did radio in Boston for three years, got kicked out for saying  the mayor's dead, is now in New York, and is a Jets fan, all those people are going to 
[00:24:00]  root for the Patriots.  What do you think the percentage is, really?  You think it's overwhelmingly that the Jets fans are going to root for the Giants?  Yeah.  Wow.  Or just not root at all.  No, you're forced to root.  Who do you go for?  Oh, the Giants.  Wow, really?  I'm rooting for the Giants.  I hate the Giants, and I have to root for them.  I can't root for the Giants.  You have to.  Really?  No.  Yeah.  They beat my team.  I would love to see Brady fucking beat the Giants, especially after 0-4. 
[00:24:30]  That would be a great story.  Because he's fucking still hurting from the undefeated season.  Poor Tom Rill.  And the great story is the fact that he can't beat them.  I like that story.  Dude, if he's going to have a...  That'll be in the back of his head for the rest of his life if he doesn't beat the Giants  in the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  This is a make good.  Because he hasn't won since 2004.  Yeah.  And then, you know, the undefeated season, and then you had that stupid catch that fucked  him up. 
[00:25:00]  Fucked up the Patriots winning that year.  It really was more than a catch, I think.  Right?  But you know what?  It's not more than $6 on Amazon.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Oh, that price of that book has taken a little dive.  Well, Joe, I'm alone today.  I don't know what to tell you.  Is he still playing?  But, I mean, I did spend three years there, too.  I like Boston a lot.  I really do.  I mean, Boston's a great town, but I hate fucking Patriots.  All right, sir.  Thank you. 
[00:25:30]  One more, and then we'll move on.  There's a Red Sox hatred carryover with New York.  It's just, it's very difficult to enjoy Boston as a sporting team.  We got Walt in Jersey.  Walt.  Give it.  Give it.  Walt.  Walt.  Walt is a big old son of a bitch.  I'm a huge jet fan.  I can't fucking stand the Giants.  I hope Tom Brady fucking just kills them.  Wow.  It's not about a division rival or anything.  There's so many arrogant, obnoxious fucking Giants fans are out here that you're going 
[00:26:00]  to look for the next year or so.  Here's a lot of people in Boston.  I mean, I've got to look at Giants fans that fucking work.  See, this is what I'm trying to say.  It's a tough spot.  I get it.  But the Giants and the Jets play in the same fucking place, too.  Well, maybe.  It's like you march in as a Jets fan and you know the Giants, you know, won the fucking  Super Bowl.  That's not a good feeling for the Jets fans.  It does have a point because Giants fans are incredibly annoying. 
[00:26:30]  But maybe their coach should have, like, guaranteed a fucking Super Bowl win, you know, after two games.  Oh, really?  Rex Ryan?  Two years in a row.  They fucking play well on the road, man.  God damn it.  Giants?  Yeah.  Giants are a good team, man.  They're the hottest team in football.  Eli Manning, he's a fucking good quarterback.  I have to officially say it.  For many years, I just thought he was kind of lucky and shit.  That guy is a great quarterback. 
[00:27:00]  He got his ass kicked yesterday.  Still threw for no interceptions.  Yeah.  No interceptions and over 300 yards.  They both took kind of a beating yesterday.  It was pretty fun to watch.  I like when the quarterback just gets smashed.  And when the pressure was on, you've got to give it to Eli.  He was right there, man.  He was right fucking there.  Look at this.  That's why.  Right there.  It barely touched his knee.  Yeah, it bounced off his knee, though.  Barely.  That guy stinks.  It is truly amazing when you see the quarterback fall back, and he's looking, and just knows 
[00:27:30]  people are behind him, ready to just fuck you up, and can still get a pass.  Wouldn't anyone else just be like, yeah.  You do that thing where you put your shoulders up and your head down and go, yeah.  Like, someone's behind me.  They're going to hurt me.  The Tom Brady.  Yeah, the Tom Brady.  When you stay in the pocket, they call it.  All right, I think my quarterback will.  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing.  Staying in the pocket is very impressive.  Fuck that.  Who was it?  Guys who can't scramble that do that.  Who went over the top?  Brady with the ball first? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  He bent over.  Can you imagine doing that?  No fucking way.  He jumped over, ball first.  Yeah.  You know, the ball just has to cross the plane.  All you got to do is cross it, yeah.  So they say, you know, you can't do that if you just need one yard on the field to get  your head taken off.  But that, you could reach out with the ball and then try to protect yourself quickly.  Yeah, yeah.  You could even drop the ball at that point.  He, yeah, and then he was like showboating there.  Spikes that ball fucking, yeah.  Him croaking out the fucking national anthem was hilarious. 
[00:28:30]  I got to play that.  I got to be honest, I didn't think it was as bad as everyone's making it out to be.  Yeah, it was pretty bad.  Compared to a suicide bombing, it wasn't bad.  But for a song, it was hideous.  I think we've had way worse, though.  If he wasn't at Foxwoods, he'd have been fucking dead.  Oh, Foxwoods.  Foxborough, he would have been fucking dead.  I don't think people would boo him.  They'd have killed him.  No, they would have killed him.  You think so?  Maybe.  Because he's synonymous with Boston and New England.  And he has to pick the next American Idol winner.  Why are they showing E-Roc's food supply? 
[00:29:00]  It was a C-130.  It's a bomber plane.  It's a lot of cargo room.  That's a hell of a fucking flyby, though.  That is pretty cool.  Also, did you see that pop over the horizon?  Yeah.  Or over the top of the stadium?  Wow.  That was pretty cool.  That must have been a moment.  I didn't think he was good at all.  I like Steven Tyler, too.  No.  We got fans everywhere, and there was a guy who was tweeting me a picture because Giselle  was walking around with a big piece of fucking cake, and he wanted me to retweet the picture.  I couldn't see the fucking piece of cake that you were so excited about. 
[00:29:30]  Why is he so excited about the cake?  He sent it to me ten times, and I finally ran it back.  I'm like, dude, I can't see the cake, so this picture means nothing.  Because he happened to be in the box with all the bigwigs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You see Mr. Kraft?  Oh, yeah.  We used to work with Mr. Kraft.  We would hobnob with them.  We used to hobnob with the Krafts.  The old man looked like...  Tipping a few back, maybe?  Wow. 
[00:30:00]  I don't know.  You think?  I don't know.  God bless him.  God bless him.  He can handle himself, though, when he has to talk to the crowd after the game.  Looking better than Joe Pa.  Oh, Joe Pa.  Oh, wait a minute.  What happened there?  He's not doing well.  We're going to need an hour for Joe Pa, so let's go with Steven Tyler first.  Yeah, yeah.  I say this wasn't that bad.  Jimmy says...  All right.  Hideous.  Anything can you see by the dawn's early light? 
[00:30:30]  Pawns right there for one second.  He sounds like the fucking redhead Montgomery from the movie Fame when he was singing on the ledge.  He fucking stints.  I didn't think it was that bad.  Oh, he reminds me of Montgomery from Fame.  I don't think it was a drop-off on his voice.  That's like Aerosmith, you know what I mean?  I don't think Steven Tyler ever had an amazing voice.  It's very raspy and very screamy.  That's what he could do.  Right.  But it, like, I don't know.  I don't think it's conducive for the National Anthem. 
[00:31:00]  It sounds flat.  Yeah.  It's kind of flat.  Yeah, they probably should have jazzed it up with something.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's another guy.  I don't think of him just doing an acapella.  And when I said...  Hello?  Acapella.  Acapella.  When I tweeted yesterday that, okay, Steven Tyler is officially an embarrassment, it wasn't  because of his National Anthem.  It was because of the promos I was seeing for Idol.  Right.  Like he's in the jet plane, I'm over here with the fucking helmet on, whoa, look out, he's  going to take off in a fighter plane, are you?  He doesn't look like an idiot. 
[00:31:30]  Everything he says is too trying to be over the top guy.  They should have got Steven Tyler 10 years ago for American Idol.  Yeah, well.  And who was that?  They were showing that girl in a bikini during the promo.  Oh, yeah.  Holy fuck.  Could you find her picture?  And what was she about?  I don't know.  Did you see this?  She walked out.  It was in the promo.  For American Idol.  Oh, right, right, right.  I didn't stay up to watch last night.  Why would I?  Gilbert Gottfried tweeted a picture of Steven Tyler's foot, I guess, at the beach. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  And said his toes, you can't unsee this.  How bad are they?  Well, two of his...  They all turn left or what?  No, no.  He's got like regular toes, but the second one to the right of the big toe and the third  one make a 90 degree hook over his big toe.  Like there's something really bad going on there.  My grandmother had that.  My dad's mom had toes that would kind of...  Isn't that hammer toes?  No, no.  It might be.  It's something.  It looks like a hammer.  It's fucking arthritis.  Older people have that. 
[00:32:30]  Can't you fix that?  Of course.  Why don't you just fix that?  I would just chop them off.  Get that repaired.  Do you need those two toes?  Probably not.  Right where they bend, I would just cut them off.  Well, some people do.  Yeah.  I'm not even going to elaborate.  You can figure it out.  That'll keep you here.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  What happened?  Well, you're holding, you're peeling, you know.  Is that inside stuff?  No, it's a horrid, horrid joke.  It's right up my alley.  Oh, look.  Yeah, see?  That's not it.  There it is.  Yeah, that's his foot.  Let me see.  That's his...  Oh, he's got a deformity.  Yeah, there's something bad going on.  And then he decides to paint them off.  Travis, tweet that shit.  I'll retweet you, man.  Let's get going here.  He decides to paint them, too.  Wow.  Why does he paint his nails like a girl?  You gotta draw attention to them. 
[00:33:30]  And is his big toe painted black, or is it dying?  Or is it just dying?  Your big toe, it's dying.  Because his big toe is black, his little toe is black, and the ones in between are red.  And they're twisted.  It just looks like there's a toe, like, hanging out on his foot.  Yeah, that's a deformity.  Okay, does he have six toes or five?  He's got five.  It looks like someone grabbed those middle toes and just jacked him to the side and snapped them.  Why doesn't he just have that fixed?  Do you know how much that must hurt his fucking, uh, with shoes on? 
[00:34:00]  What a nightmare time he must have with shoes and fucking...  Can't wear sandals.  Do you think he tucks them where they belong, though?  Are they rubbery or rigid?  Does he tuck them where they belong and then pull his shoesies on?  I don't know.  Travis, tweet that.  I'll retweet you.  I will.  Disgusting.  What was I going to say?  That's terrible.  Maybe he didn't finish the song.  Maybe he's making some kind of, like, uh, maybe he's crossing his fingers and his toes.  No, because it was just him, like, uh, in the beach.  That was a close-up of a picture where he was, uh, frolicking in the water.  Wow, wow, wow.  Yeah.  What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, whose broad stripes and bright stars 
[00:34:30]  Through the perilous fight  Oh, the ramparts we watched  Hold on to your hats  Were so gallantly streaming 
[00:35:00]  And the rocket's red glare  Has been bursting in air  See what you gotta do if you're an Aerosmith?  You just gotta imagine all those guitars in the background  Yeah, yeah, whatever  And it's Steven Tyler  But you take all that away, and I guess, yeah, you're right  Yeah, it was okay  He wanted, I guarantee you, Kraft just wanted him to hang out in the booth and watch the game 
[00:35:30]  And invited him, and they had to get him to sing the national anthem to get him to show up  That scream works with Dream On  No, I think it goes a lot deeper than that  That's an American Idol fucking tie-in  That's what they're starting to do  Oh, right  They're like, okay, we  Look, national anthem  American Idol  Game's on the same fucking network  Let's get Steven Tyler to do the national anthem  Exactly  Instead of getting probably a much better singer that could pull it off  Well, considering that that was on CBS  What? 
[00:36:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah  Oh, that was the other game  I thought it was, oh, I thought it was the Fox team  Um, oh, oh  Why would CBS have the American Idol on then?  The American Idol guy  Wow  Oh  Please don't look at me  Oh  Why?  Please don't look at me  Please don't look at me  Please don't look at me  Maybe it will switch networks or something  Oh, wow  Please don't look at me  Maybe the same guy owns both TV stations  I don't think that is, Jimmy  God, I had a brilliant theory, and it's not even close to right  As a matter of fact, it couldn't be wronger 
[00:36:30]  And I was backing up like a yes man  Yeah, that must have been it  The Prime Minister before Churchill was more right about Germany than you were about that theory  Please turn off the lights  As a matter of fact, let's all just go home  Yeah, that's a show-ending error right there  He's promoting Lost  Wait, you sure?  Oh  Look at me, hoping for  Hoping it gets over  Yeah, he's right  American Idol's still on Fox 
[00:37:00]  Oh, wow  Oh, yeah  So that would be not a smart thing to do  No  So then there was some inside shit going on  Yeah, just Boston  It's a big game  Yeah  Nah  Oof  Oof  Through the night, that our flag was still there.  Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, the land of the free, in the home of the brave.  I didn't think it was that bad.  I liked it more this time than I did when I first heard it. 
[00:38:00]  It's just very Stephen Pyre.  I don't think it was bad enough to kill him over it.  That's people that don't, I guess, don't know what he fucking sings like.  I mean, I wasn't killing him on the national anthem thing.  He just comes off as a douche these days.  Tough song to sing.  Doing it by himself.  Sort of a little kind of like, not monotone, but just kind of flat.  Thank you, flat.  Being a fucking shill for Fox because the, oh.  Yeah, you know, the supper now.  Big time.  Oh, wait, wait. 
[00:38:30]  They're going to get Charlie Sheen because of two and a half.  Oh, no.  That's the network.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  I'm turning off my Twitter.  Okay.  Well, it was cool because you said it with such conviction.  Turn off the phones, please.  Like, you know, because that's what they're doing now.  Not like this sounds like a good idea.  You were like, no, like you had the inside skinny.  Government allows them that.  It was the CBS game, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It sure was. 
[00:39:00]  What's worse, that or my personal favorite, your Howard Johnson comment?  Oh.  What was the Howard Johnson comment?  I forget now.  When he wanted to know why Howard Johnson was walking around with a uniform on.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, right.  That was a guy.  I forgot about that.  It's my favorite thing.  I thought Howard Johnson lost his mind and it just made me laugh so hard.  That is a funny one.  Well, it turned out he was like the batting coach or something.  Yeah, coach is wearing a uniform.  Where was he walking around with a uniform, though?  On the field.  On the field. 
[00:39:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  But it was something else.  Wasn't it a bakery or anything?  It was on the field.  Wasn't it for like old-timers day or something?  I think it was just a regular game and maybe it was old-timers day and you were wondering  why he was wearing a uniform.  No, there's more.  I'm still a douche for saying that, but there was more details that I need to know now.  I don't remember.  I think it was old-timers day and I think everyone else had suits on.  I'm like, why the fuck did he come out?  You might be right.  I don't know.  Well, maybe he would have been playing, though.  You could have said, oh, maybe he was playing and that's why he had the uniform on. 
[00:40:00]  I didn't mean to bring it up.  No, I knew he was not playing.  Yeah?  I knew that much, but I didn't realize.  No, that he was playing in the old-timers game.  I don't remember.  Someone help me out.  Like they were honoring some old Mets or something.  We can go through the audience.  Nah, whatever.  Yeah.  If someone remembers, please, so it really hurts.  Please, do it to me.  To make the show official, we've got to play the last two calls of the games.  Sorry, Travis.  Oh, yeah.  First one's going to make you real sad. 
[00:40:30]  I've already heard it in my head a thousand times.  Almost 32 yards, the title.  And the kick.  Look out!  Look out!  It's no good!  It's no good!  I look out.  I like that.  I like that.  Look out!  Look out!  I think one of the guys on the sideline just went, you got to be shitting me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a terrible, that's a terrible coaching decision to not take that time out. 
[00:41:00]  I didn't realize that they had one left and didn't take it.  Yeah, why wouldn't you use it right there?  Well, they said we'll have to re-evaluate that.  Ha ha!  Re-evaluate?  How about, we should have done that.  The whole season comes down to that.  Well, neither single mistake was the, like, an absolute game winner.  See, it's easier when your team doesn't make the playoffs, Travis.  Yeah, you know.  In the end, it's easier that your team doesn't make the playoffs than being knocked out like that.  I would have rather them just got blown out. 
[00:41:30]  Of course.  Well, yeah, athletes will even tell you that.  They sleep nice after a blowout.  They have horrible nights sleep after, you know, a close loss.  Never seen a worse loss.  I couldn't sleep last night.  I'm laying in bed, and I'm like, I just thought of the players, too.  I'm like, what is it?  Like, I was just slept too late yesterday.  But I'm like, what is that kicker thinking?  Or that guy?  Like, when you lose a big game like that, and you know that one move you made, like, I would be punching myself. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, my gosh.  Because I'm so, I couldn't live with myself.  He, yeah, he could kill himself over this.  What are you doing when that happens?  Because that's all, that's his job right there.  That's it.  It's not like, you know, he had an amazing game and then had one horrible play.  That's all he does.  That's what they pay him for.  But you're letting the whole team down.  Like, Buckner's the guy that got all the shit for it.  But there's always examples of that in sports, of guys who make the mistake.  And the other teams, their players are always like, eh.  But you know their players want to go, you cock-sucking motherfucker. 
[00:42:30]  We worked hard.  We didn't.  You stink.  Plus, you play on a team with Ray Lewis.  He could easily murder you, for real.  I wouldn't want to be around him right now.  Ray Lewis could murder you over that.  That's what he said.  He said, I feel the worst about letting down Ray Lewis.  Really?  Because he's not getting any younger.  He wants to get back to the Super Bowl.  And this was their best chance.  You know, baseball, you get away with that shit unless it's a Buckner thing.  Like, the pitcher always has the brunt of the pressure on him. 
[00:43:00]  And if you're pitching really bad and just the conga line and the team around the bases,  then you're fucked up.  Did he see that?  But if you just throw on the little low one outside and someone connects with it  and fucking plows it out of the park, they don't look at him like,  oh, you fucking blew it for us, you know?  A walk-off home run or something like that.  Only relief pitchers get killed like that.  A relief pitcher will get killed if they're blowing it.  Because they're not supposed to do that.  Watch this.  Yeah.  Watch this.  It's no good. 
[00:43:30]  It's no good.  No!  It's a screamy guy.  Oh, dude.  What a great idea.  But I took it off his TV audio.  And you put it together horribly.  Yeah, yeah.  Go back and forth with the guy. 
[00:44:00]  Back and forth where he's kind of got an expression like...  Match up your audio a little better.  ...of anticipation on his face.  Pick a clip.  You would have had a fucking viral video, man.  It's a great idea.  That's a good one.  What do you know?  Sam's now looking for something else.  What are you doing, Sam?  Might be good.  What are you doing, Sam?  I'm looking for the reactions when his teammates made faces.  Yeah, you can read their lips.  Oh, man.  Let's see what they say.  Oh, the internet's got so many funny little inside jokes. 
[00:44:30]  Unless it's a guy like Tom Brady.  Like, if Brady throws an interception and the ball gets dropped, because he's Brady,  how mad...  Like, they might be annoyed he did that, but what can you say?  He's one of the greats of all time.  But when a guy like a kicker...  But if Brady fucking fumbles it on, you know, deep in their own fucking...  Like, on the 10...  Yeah, but...  And lets the other team score and win in overtime or something like that, that would be bad. 
[00:45:00]  It would be, but I think that the team wouldn't be like, you piece of shit, because it's  Brady, who they know is so great.  He's done nothing but win.  It hurt.  You're gonna fuck up.  You're gonna be way more pissed at a kicker.  Well, this guy was completely out of the league four years ago.  Or five years ago.  Oh, boy.  The kicker?  Yeah.  And he's gonna be again.  Yeah, how do you sell yourself next year?  How do you sell yourself next year?  How do you think that call is?  The agent?  Yeah.  Um, yeah, look, this is bad for you. 
[00:45:30]  You missed that kick, and I go...  There's just no one gonna be calling.  Maybe we could get you a gig on Sirius XM Subway Radio.  Well...  I do like book radio.  You can get the afternoon salon of book radios open.  I'm gonna try to work the CFL.  We'll see.  We'll see, maybe.  We'll see if there's any...  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  Are these the reactions?  You can read their lips.  It's Ray Rice.  Ray.  Ray.  He said, oh, my God. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, my God, yeah.  He has to walk back.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, they're all just walking away.  Oh, that's...  Oh, do they just look stunned.  They're stunned.  They got down.  They were like, this is gonna go to overtime.  We got a chance.  This is great.  Oh, wait.  We lost.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, my God.  Trying to spin it around.  Did not quite get the laces all the way, but just a 32-yarder and a Pro Bowl kicker a year ago. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, my God.  Wow, he hooked it.  Hooked it.  I couldn't believe that.  Hooked it by a mile.  Yeah.  You think they're gonna run the draw?  Get the first down.  And he knows it the second...  You know that when you do that.  Of course.  When, like, you're bowling as an amateur.  You just throw the ball and go, ah, that sucked.  Travis, how awful was the first time I'm seeing this part of the game?  Why?  I turned it off immediately. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  It was terrible, right?  It was the worst loss I've had as a fan.  I'm gonna suck.  They're hearing the fans and the fireworks going off, and they just gotta be like, wait, we  were supposed to be playing overtime.  I would run back to the locker room.  I'd keep my football uniform on.  I'd grab all my stuff, throw it in a duffel bag, and just leave.  Yeah.  I would not go back to the team.  Oh, you mean leave the whole team?  I would not...  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  Is that a bus...  No, they take the planes, obviously.  You're gonna get back on a plane with these guys? 
[00:47:30]  Oh, man.  Fuck no.  This would be a bad one.  I would be hailing a cab.  Yeah.  I want to go to a train station immediately.  I'm out of here.  Do athletes really, like, look at it like, yeah, he missed the kick, but we also...  Will they also look at the other stuff that fucked up?  Like, yeah, that was that moment, but...  I don't know.  He did drop that pass, and you know what?  Yeah, the rest of it's just the game.  They'll say they do.  I mean, like, they interviewed...  But to themselves, I mean, do they?  I'm sure.  They're human.  No, but in the end, they're like, holy fuck, dude. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  You know, it was a tough game, and you gotta feel bad for Billy right now, but it's a team  effort, that motherfucker, uh, Billy, uh, you know, was...  Yeah, you gotta feel bad.  You know, hey, look, it's a team.  We win and lose is a team, and in this case, uh, you know, I guess we all hooked it to the  left, didn't we?  I guess all of us just sat on the bench on our fat asses and hooked it to the left.  When we needed to kick it through the uprights, we all hooked it to the left. 
[00:48:30]  Win and lose is a team.  Um, yeah.  Yes, we do.  As a team.  Oh, wait, what?  Hold on.  If this is real, this could be fucking hilarious.  Mike, come on, go ahead.  Hey, Owen, what's going on?  Hey, welcome back.  Thank you, buddy.  Um, I don't know if you guys caught it, and I know you're still talking about the Ravens  game, but, um, yesterday, after the Giants won, right before they went to commercial,  they had Steve Weatherford, the Giants punter, who held the ball on the field goal, on the 
[00:49:00]  winning field goal.  Um, running down the field with his arms out, and you could see him mouthing the words while  he was screaming at the time, I'm going to the fucking...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That one was great.  I saw that.  What was that?  I saw him laughing.  He holds the fucking ball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hold the ball.  Yeah.  There you go.  He holds the ball.  Yeah.  Right here.  Here he is.  All right.  He can't get his helmet off, and he's like, I'm going to the fucking...  I like it.  The fucking super ball. 
[00:49:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I think he says motherfucking.  Oh, yeah, huh?  He might have, yeah.  Wait, do it again.  Oh, the league should fine him for that.  They probably will.  Yeah, that's motherfucking.  Yeah, yeah, motherfucking super ball.  Ha, ha, motherfucking super ball.  He holds the ball.  You know, I know.  When that went down, I thought it was the field goal kicker at first.  I didn't realize it was the guy that was just holding the ball until later on.  He looks like a father that beats his kids. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Well, we got Mike Frances on the line.  What?  Oh, wow.  Oh, good.  Thank you, sir.  Mikey, congratulations to your Giants.  I know you're a big Giants fan and hate the Jets.  Well, I never picked sides here, okay?  But the Giants did a fantastic job, okay?  First, let me start off by saying it's been a while for someone on your show, okay?  It's called resting a bit.  You should know about that, Mike.  But this is a perfect spot for you, sir.  Mikey, what do you got? 
[00:50:30]  I'd like to accept my nomination of Caller of the Year 2011, okay?  It was very nice to you, okay?  So I gracefully accept, okay?  Okay.  Okay.  Giants, do you remember when I called my picks a few weeks ago, okay?  I told you that in this league, you learn from losses and you bounce back.  When the 49ers handled the Giants, I said that they were going to bounce back, okay?  And that's what you saw after that, okay?  So the G-men, okay, although a gallant effort this weekend, are now facing the Juggernaut, 
[00:51:00]  which is the best quarterback in the world, okay?  Paul Brady's best quarterback in the world, okay?  In the world.  He didn't play like that yesterday.  Listen, sometimes, you know, it's good for the league, okay?  I mean, he could go out there and throw touchdowns on the side behind his back, okay?  Between the legs, okay?  Special Liberty play, okay?  Look for the ratings, okay?  You have to let him in, okay?  Well, now, if you want to touch on a topic here, okay, quickly, Joe Pa, okay? 
[00:51:30]  We'll move on.  We'll stay on the football team here, okay?  Yeah.  Let's not paint this man out to be Gandhi, okay?  I think he had cancer all along.  He knew that the Sandusky thing was coming.  This is a perfect doubt, okay?  And if you ask me, the man may be still alive, okay?  That's going on on a limb.  You never know.  Think about the specialism of the story here for a second, okay?  Yeah.  Big city, the big neighbors, okay? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  If he comes out after the Super Bowl and he says, I'm alive, okay?  And he was sent back here by Father Tebow, okay?  I gave him his blessings and back he comes from the grave, okay?  We're talking about the new Tupac, okay?  Anyway, it's Joe Pa, okay?  Joe Pa, okay?  Can I read some comments?  Yeah.  Still to laugh at this bit.  Not funny anymore.  He doesn't even sound like Mike anymore.  I disagree with the criticism.  I disagree, man.  I disagree. 
[00:52:30]  I'm just reading what the people are saying.  And click.  I like this bit a lot.  I'm just enjoying him talking about anything.  Yes.  Because I hate Francesca so much.  Well, this bit died with Joe Pa.  I happen to like this guy.  They just have to be negative about everything, I guess, huh?  Well, they just don't like it.  But I like this.  But you know what it is?  This might not be a good bit if you're not.  Excuse me, Mike.  A lot of those might not be New York callers either. 
[00:53:00]  So if you're from Boston or you're from San Francisco, maybe I'll name more cities.  You don't listen to Francesca.  So you don't understand how enraging and fat and awful he is?  This is a New York bit.  The best place has been coming for some time, okay?  I've been getting some tweets, okay?  The kids are not into it anymore, okay?  And quite frankly, I don't have any more gas in this bit, okay?  He's funny, man.  I'm a terrible attention whore, okay? 
[00:53:30]  And I got nothing else.  I got a quote.  What am I going to do, okay?  I'm a one-trick party.  What am I going to do, okay?  What am I going to do, okay?  And they don't like me, okay?  And it's very easy, okay?  But they don't like...  See, I'm confused because they don't like Mike Francesca either.  Yeah, yeah.  So that's why I think it's still a good bit.  Oh, yeah.  Because this is what Mike does every day on his show.  He drives his own listeners nuts.  Well, I do have a special guest here.  All right, Eric, if you go to weather.com and you put in a story, it says...  Wait, wait, is that November?  Wait, October snow?  Go to weather.com and put in a story, and it'll come up three inches of snow for Saturday. 
[00:54:00]  Well, we have to look at this.  No, I'll look.  It's going to snow this Saturday.  You're going to tell me.  This Saturday.  Before Halloween.  I've never seen it snow before Halloween.  Is that possible?  Is it going to be 30 degrees?  Mike, did you say this once?  It's going to be 30 degrees here Saturday?  It's got to be 30 to snow.  All right.  I've never seen it snow before Halloween.  What am I going to tell you?  Sometimes it happens, okay? 
[00:54:30]  And I've been at it before, okay?  And the callers, they don't like that it's fine, okay?  Listen, I got a tweet from the kids.  I'm disappointed.  One guy, too, tweets me, I'm afraid that your tweets are going downhill.  I get back.  Is that all you're afraid of?  Really?  Is that all you're afraid of in your life?  I'm good for you.  Then you have a nice life.  What can I tell you?  I think...  You're worried about me.  Yeah.  That's it.  You obviously have a Trump life, okay?  And I felt a little heat coming from there, but that's okay, okay?  But for the special treat here, if I'm dying, I've got a special guest here, okay?  Uh-oh.  And he's a friend of the show, okay? 
[00:55:00]  Uh-oh.  That you maybe have had some beef with before, okay?  What I'm going to tell you a little bit for you, okay?  Because you've got a little insight on the Pete's, the Pats, and the Giants, okay?  Governor, a Jesse Vincora.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  He's going to turn around?  Oh, no.  Must his hair and turn back around?  Is this fucking Iggy from Taxi there, too?  And Jack Nicholson?  Oh, yeah.  No, I want to hear what Ventura says.  Do you know why that the Patriots have an edge over the Giants? 
[00:55:30]  Because an inside source says that they've...  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  It's like Stockard Channing.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Well, let's eat.  Yeah.  Seriously, XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:56:00]  Come gather around people wherever you roam  And admit that the waters around you have grown  And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone  If your time to you is worth saving  Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone  For the times, they are a-changing 
[00:56:30]  I'm writers and critics who'll prophesize with your pen  And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again  And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin  And there's no telling who that it's naming  For the loser now will be later to win 
[00:57:00]  For the times, they are a-changing  Getting topical  Hold up, wait a minute  With the sex man  Good morning, sexy  Good morning  Bob Dylan today, huh?  Yeah  What are you thinking?  It could be Bob Dylan or it could be the times, they are a-changing  Well, the old E-Rock would have played Dylan because it's his birthday 
[00:57:30]  But it's not Bob Dylan's birthday  Because we told him to go deeper and get a little more clever  The times, they are a-changing  Are a-changing  X amount of years ago, this song was released  No, we told him not to do that anymore  No, we told him we want something  No, he's got to get a little more clever  Yeah, yeah  You'll look clever there  The harmonica was invented on a certain date  Oh, that's a good one  Oh, no  Then don't criticize what you can't understand 
[00:58:00]  Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command  I have no idea  Is there anything, uh, there's nothing on the sheet that fits this?  Man accused of domestic abuse claims a ghost gave his wife all his bruises  That's got to be it  Is that it?  No, that's not it  Damn it!  I thought that was it  Um, wow  Is this for, uh, Seal and Heidi Klum?  No  Is there, uh, getting a divorce?  Aww  Aww 
[00:58:30]  God bless him  Ah, yeah  Aww  Good luck with that  Well, I would love to just fucking bang her  And have her tell me how much better of a fuck he was  The order is rapidly  Vietnam ended?  Oh, well  Well, close  Started  Started 
[00:59:00]  Thirty-nine years ago today  President Nixon announced  They've reached an end to the Vietnam War  What?  What happened?  Reached an end to the Vietnam War  I was born before that  Wait, what?  That's what it is?  Mm-hmm  So why'd you play that?  Because it's from the period  No, it's probably not  That's a lot earlier than the end of the war  That would have been the beginning of the war  The end of the war  It would have been better to do, like, um  More trippy shit  There were no end of the war songs yet  Well 
[00:59:30]  There's a good tune by, uh  I am Butterfly called  The War is Over, Duda  Or, uh  You didn't like that one, are you?  No, the time periods don't jibe  The times there are changing?  Yeah, exactly  Why don't you play Beethoven?  Because he was deaf  And then we will feel deaf after the war  Wouldn't you have played a song  With maybe the word end in it?  Yeah, yeah  This is the end  This is the end  And then that's got Vietnam  Right 
[01:00:00]  In it because it was used in Apocalypse Now  And the end  That's it, man  Yeah, that's it  The times are changing  I don't know  Boo  Boo  It was more like early 60s  Kind of like he noticed the  Yeah  The times there were a change in  Yeah  Around them  And starting to be like the Vietnam War  And the 60s movements and everything  And hippies  Yeah, the change from the 50s  Kind of, uh  Leave it to beaver mentality  To, uh  You know, the hippie thing  Yeah  That's terrible  E-Rock 
[01:00:30]  Your history  I think it's another bad one, E-Rock  Your history, not, um  In all fairness, I think it's another bad one  Oh, well, there's always tomorrow  I thought you were going to go with something like  Isn't this the anniversary of, um  Hulk Hogan beating, uh  The Iron Sheik  Or the Iron Sheik beating Hulk Hogan  Or some Wrestlemania thing  At Madison Square Garden  I think it is  Is it?  I think it is  That song was released in January of 64  64  64, we just were kind of really getting into it 
[01:01:00]  11 years off  We were really starting to dig our feet in  Yeah, yeah  The advisors were being, uh  Supplemented with actual troops  And  McNamara was scaring the shit out of the president  You control McNamara  You control Kennedy  What about a Coming Home song?  Yeah, yeah  By Skinner, I'm Coming Home  That's it  What?  Coming Home by Leonard Skinner  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da  Yeah, something about home 
[01:01:30]  Something about leaving  Something about the end  How about you play that?  Coming Home  It's a good one  Times they are changing is a little vague  You know  They're changing  They're changing  The Iron Sheik  What does it say?  January 23rd  What's today's date?  23rd  Yeah, there you go  Hogan won his first WWF championship  Hulkamania started  Pinning the Iron Sheik  Hulkamania started on this day  Oh, E-Rock  E-Rock  Now that's 
[01:02:00]  If you and I  If you would have played this  It would have been like  Alright  It has to do with the guy  Right  But it's not the band or anything  It's that  And it has to do with Hulkamania  And had I played this  You would have said  The Vietnam War  Came to an agreement to end  What about Jay-Z's club shutting down?  Nah  Nah  We would have kind of had to give you this one  Nah, this one we would have had to give you  I think this one we would have had to give you  Hulk Hogan  No, why?  Because you  A real American  What's the matter, Jimmy?  You don't like it? 
[01:02:30]  This is great  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What song is this?  This is Hulk's song  Yeah  Oh, yeah  Oh, would he do the dance?  Oh, yeah  He would do that whole thing  What was he trying to hear?  His wife filing for divorce?  And then he would  Would people go nuts?  Oh, yeah  Yeah, yeah  People just go batshit  Hulkamania  His first WWF championship  First WWF championship  On this day 
[01:03:00]  In what?  1980  84  Four  That's craziness  That E-Rock missed this one  You dropped the ball, my friend  Well, I apologize  But, you know  Sam also could have brought that  To my attention  Oh  It's not called  Blame Sam  Yeah, because it's getting topical  With the sex man and Sam  It's the sex man's job  Ah, that's true  You can't blame  Your name is on the marquee  Hulk Hogan  You're the number one Hulkamaniac  Hulk Hogan's not my hero  He's your number one hero  Yeah, you wanted to sit  In an empty seat at Wemblee  Wemblee 
[01:03:30]  This is your bit  This is your thing  I say we give E-Rock another chance  At his bit  Yeah  After the next break  Coming back from the next break  Yeah, exactly  Let's see if you've learned anything  Getting topical with shithead  The times they are changing  That's a stretch  That stunk  Yeah  That's a stretch  I think it was fantastic  That was terrible  Really bad  This is the better  The Hulkamaniacs  I think if it says  Vietnam War ends  Then you  Right away  Alright, end, end  Let's go with end  And then you try to find something  This is the end  Yeah 
[01:04:00]  I've never wanted to knock something  Out of someone's hands  So badly  Oh no, I've been waiting for this  Play of Kenny's Pop-Tarts  Low snap  The kick  Is good  And the Giants are going back  To the Super Bowl  Boring call, by the way  That's a boring fucking call  Right there  End of a Giants  That's a boring call  That was a little dullsville 
[01:04:30]  And Sam did a little research  I guess Jets fans are going for the Giants  On all the boards, huh?  Yep  Oh  Hmm  I know  It's a tough spot, though, man  Come on  You cannot go with the Pats  I am going with the Pats  I mean  I will use the collective you  How about  You're right, though  We've got to find Jets fans  That lived in Boston  For a period of time  Right  See what they're going for  Some kind of connection  Yeah, mine makes sense  Yeah  Yeah 
[01:05:00]  I'm used to go there  Foxboro  Fuck yeah  Yeah  For many things  So I see the connection  But, I mean  New York now  What did Craftson want us for?  I forget now  Was it lacrosse?  What was it?  What were we doing up there?  I don't even know  Was it soccer?  Showed us everything  Yeah, he did  I think it was that  He's got a big fucking hog  Oh  You weren't privy to that part  Of the tour?  I think it might have been  Yeah, it must have been soccer  I don't know  Were they bringing soccer  To Foxboro?  Because they wanted us bad 
[01:05:30]  Yeah  And Bob Craft Jr. was  Is it Bob Craft Jr.?  I don't even remember anymore  Or Jonathan Craft, right?  Right till  Jonathan Craft  Right till we got thrown out  He was  Yeah, he was an alright guy, man  Yeah  I think it was when they brought  Soccer to Boston  I like them guys  I got no qualms about them  But I certainly  I'm not gonna root for the Pats  We did many a gig  In that parking lot  Oof  Yeah  I broadcast from Foxboro  I gotta have a fucking  Super Bowl party 
[01:06:00]  You do?  I gotta have a Super Bowl party now  Because  You know, I got my aunts  Uncles and all that  And they're all  Giant, giant fans  Really?  Oh yeah  Fucking crazy ass  Giant fans in my family  What is the Super Bowl?  So what happened to you?  I don't know  I just  The whole football thing  Yeah  That helps  But I  I don't know  How did you not get swept away  In the Giants thing?  I don't know  I really don't know  But I just didn't  You never really got into football  Never really got into football 
[01:06:30]  I like it  I like when it's  Very important games  I love football  Like that  It was fun watching last night  You're either in the Super Bowl  Or you're not  That's kind of  You know  Pressure  Pretty exciting, right?  Like that  And both games coming down  To a field goal  Yeah  That's alright  There have been some  Games this year  That were  Jeez  A lot of fucking  Like clinchers  Right at the end  It was a real good season  For football  Really good season  Even though I didn't watch  I just knew  From the highlights  Not good  Not good for my Jets  But  So uh  How do you think  Tebow's gonna do  In the Super Bowl? 
[01:07:00]  Oh wait  What happened?  You could joke all you want  But Tebow had an amazing year  For those Broncos  Well he did  He wasn't supposed to do shit  No one's talking about Tebow anymore  Exactly  Thank God  But they're already  Saying he's gonna be  The starting quarterback  Next year  He's gonna get his ass  Handed to him  He's a decent quarterback  But he's not  It was just the story  If he wasn't kneeling  And fucking  Marrying himself  To Christ publicly  After every play  Nobody would give a fuck  About Tebow  Yeah  Yeah  He had a nice little run  But that's it  But that's the guy 
[01:07:30]  I don't think he's like  Forcing it  I think that's just the guy  I'm sure that is him  I think he was just  Brought up like  That way  So awful  Just one of those guys  Could someone explain  The video that keeps  Showing on Fox News  It looks like it's  A mountain bike guy  On the edge  Of a fucking cliff  Is that motocross  Or a mountain bike  Does anyone know  The story behind this  They're showing it  Over and over again  So it's some kind  Of viral video  That hit today  Do we know yet 
[01:08:00]  I don't know  It's a helmet cam  Of some guy  Just going on a ridge  It looks crazy  It looks like if he fell  He would absolutely die  It looks like he's riding  Either a mountain bike  Is it a mountain bike  Can you tell  Oh no  It's a dirt bike  I think that's a fucking  It's a dirt bike  It's a motocross bike  Right  You think that's bullshit  Or true  No  No that's true  But he's got like  One of those GoPro  Cameras on his helmet  And honestly  It looks like  He's riding his bike  On like a  Like a two by four  Yeah  I see how the track  So he's not the first 
[01:08:30]  Guy to do it  So  That's pretty fucked up  Though  Yeah it is  Thrill seeker  Wow  He's a thrill seeker  That's like the top  Of the mountain ridge  I do remember  Now can you spell it  Alright we just missed it  You'll see it for yourself  It's everywhere today  It's called insane mountain riding  On YouTube  He's right on the ridge  The pointy ridge  He's going fast too  But what makes this insane  It's ice and snow  On top of the fact that  He doesn't have much room for error 
[01:09:00]  He has no room for error  If he falls  He is a dead man  Oh and he's sliding around  That's hilarious  This guy's nuts  What the fuck  Wow  Yeah that's a big drop off  That's crazy  How about to the right though  Would he just slide down  Or would he be dead  I don't know  I think  I think both sides  Whoa  Hey  He skirted that fucking  Crevasse  It's ice and snow 
[01:09:30]  That's  This doesn't make sense to me  What do you call that  Is it a ridge officially  Yeah  Yeah that's like a ridge  A little  It's a top fucking point  It's very pointy  Right  It's incredibly steep  To the right and left of him  Whoa  The room for his bike  It can't be more than  Six inches across  Eight inches across maybe  Yeah at times  It's just  Less than a foot  I would say  Why is this higher  He's like fake  He looks  Whoa  Nah it's not fake  That's the GoPro camera 
[01:10:00]  That's how that shit looks  He's just looking around  Like yeah  Yeah man  Look at what I did  I'm a badass  Shuts his bike off  That video's everywhere  It's a wacko  I'd have shown my face though  Because people are going to be like  Yeah that's me  It's called insane mountain riding  He's probably walking  With a fake bike front on  And then he just  Dubbed it  No he's just good at doing those noises  That's his thing  That would be great  That's just  What we all hear  When women speak  He's just got the front forks 
[01:10:30]  In his hand  Yeah  And he's just running with it  That's funny  He's fucking speeding up the video  This guy is on the line  He just hung up though  I'm a Giants fan  I live up here in Boston  Pat's fans are already  Talking shit  Well of course  What are you supposed to do  What they do  Wait till Thursday  Yeah  It's on

[01:13:30]  Somewhere in the ship  With her life jacket  Still on  Just kind of floating around  Dead  Yeah  Jimmy's right though  The 30 is  If you were on that ship  That capsized  And tilted over  The cruise line  Is going to offer you  30% off  On your next cruise  With them  That's nice  What a set of balls  30  What do you think  Would be the right  Percentage to offer  Free  100 for life  No you're getting  This one  Oh you think  They should all be  Offered a free cruise  Yes 
[01:14:00]  Free cruise for life  Cause most  Just one free cruise  Most of these people  Would never take them up on  They'd be like  Fuck that  You get this one  Your money back  And a free cruise after  Right  Okay that's fair  Yeah most of the people  Wouldn't do that  They're fucking scared now  But what a typical  30%  Scumbag company move to make  You wonder why people  Sue companies  Jimmy you're talking about  Giving getting back  The money from this cruise  They're not even  Going to do that  And don't have to  Yeah  There's a maritime law  And the tickets  That people buy 
[01:14:30]  You sign  Literally  Sign a contract  Which says that  You can't sue them  All these boats  Are foreign flagged  So even in the United States  You can't just go to  A US court  With a lawyer  You know  A nice scumbaggy  American lawyer  That'll sue  You're done  You can't  You can't get anything  But they are going to sue  In Italy  And the US  130 bucks  You get for your belongings  I think that's how much  They allot for it  And you cannot sue them  You can't sue them  They are going to 
[01:15:00]  They are suing though  And also they're saying  They are offering  Full refunds  For this cruise  Because I think Carnival  Is the parent company  Yeah  And they don't want  To get all shitted on  But tall for 30%  That's just an insult  It's disgusting  But it's again  It's a typical  Big company scumbag move  It's an insult  Most people wouldn't  Take you up on that  They don't want to go  On another cruise  The boat sank  Right  Most people would say  Fuck that  A free cruise  Plus your money back  Is  Because they're not all 
[01:15:30]  Going to take it  At the same time anyway  Is a real show of  At least we're trying  To do something  A real show of  I think we fucked up  Yeah  The fucking boat  Went down  Yeah  You see the latest pictures  How close it was  To shore  Oh yeah  It was right  Right the fuck there  Right there  By the way  I want to thank  Kevin from Philly  He's right  Tracy diabetic  He would have  Looked intoxicated  If he was  You know  If that sugar  Level was dropping  That's true  Heading into a  Diabetic coma  A lot of these  A lot of 
[01:16:00]  People that have  Diabetes deal with  This all the  Fucking time  Yeah so  But knowing Tracy  He might have been  Intoxicated  Who knows  Which isn't the  Best thing to do  If you are diabetic  No  Drinking is not  A good  Good thing to do  A nine  It's good how  We're putting on  Brave faces today  And trying to get  The last  But let's be honest  We're all in grief  Over the Joe Pott thing  Joe Pott  I saw your tweets  Jimmy  And they were  Heartbreaking  They were heartbreaking  That the 
[01:16:30]  You  One of the few people  That actually were  Supporting Joe Pott  I was glad to see that  I felt it was appropriate  In his time of grief  Because he's  He was a mainstay  There at Penn State  And it was about  Football  Not about any  Controversy  I don't even want  To bring it up  Because it's an  Insult  To the memory  Of Joe Pott  To bring up  Oh yeah  The fact that  One of his  Underlings  Were a fucking  Ten year old boy  In the ass  In the shower  Did you unfollow me  What  I think you unfollowed me  I unfollowed you  Yeah 
[01:17:00]  I took on the Joe Pott's too  I can't  I can't be part of that  I took on the Joe Pott's  Fucking idiots out there  They're just idiots  Yeah  They really are  He had a great  A great career  As a football coach  But he failed  As a human being  And people just don't  Want to fucking deal with that  They don't want to  Fucking deal with that  It's amazing how  Defensive people get  Sorry but  He failed  Yeah  He did  He either did  These are your two options  He either did nothing  Or the bare minimum  And allowed shit to continue 
[01:17:30]  He  He did what he had to do  As far as  His  Obligation  It's almost  He covered the bases  Right  Sandusky says  And this might be false  That Joe Paterno  Didn't ever talk to him  About the charges  So this isn't like  He heard  This is why  I hate this guy  And I  I don't  I didn't  I feel bad for his family  Because like  They lost him  But he  It wasn't like  A ten year old  Said  Hey this happened  And then you have  A kid's word 
[01:18:00]  Against  Another adult  Independently came  And said  I saw him  Fucking a kid  Yeah  Like  And Paterno  Did the minimum  It's like  He's just  I'm sorry  The guy's a scumbag  For doing the minimum  I'm tired  Of these dummies  Because he was a good  Football coach  Standing around his statue  But meanwhile  If Michael Richards  Showed up at a college  They would boo him  Yeah  Because he dropped  N-bombs at the laugh factory  Fucking dummies  A lot of people would argue  That he did a lot of good 
[01:18:30]  I'm sure he did  In his 40 to 50 years  I'm sure he was terrific  But the problem is  This was a biggie  This was a biggie  And went unnoticed  For what  Over a decade easily  Right  Do you know if Sandusky  Was found  That he had  Embezzled money  From the college  They would have  His picture up  Do not ever allow  This man  Even near  It would have been  Everybody would have been  Like well that's scumbag  And just that  The fact that  That would be a bigger thing  Than fucking a child 
[01:19:00]  Right  It's just amazing  When you get info like that  Everything has to stop  Yeah  You don't just do  The bare minimum  If you believe that  Even  I question that  And then you continue  With football practice  Like nothing is going on  Everything has to stop  Still interacting with this  Right  Still interacting with this guy  Right  Are you sexually attracted  To children?  You know  I love that answer  I enjoy young people 
[01:19:30]  I  Like  Patting their legs  Right  Appropriate  Did you mean to just yell  No though  When I asked that question  Before the question was out  Did you mean to just yell  Oh my god  No  No  No  No  No  To answer your question  As soon as you are  Really  As soon as you are aware  Of the question  You say no  Even before the guy  Finishes the question  That was hilarious  Oh wait  I know this has to be no 
[01:20:00]  Right  You're right  What a tool  Yeah well people are up in arms  They don't like the fucking abuse  He's taken  I don't know about that  Twitterverse  I got 95% support  Yeah  For smashing him  Yeah  And making fun of him  I'm with Jimmy  I was watching the situation  Closely yesterday  Yeah you got  You have to do with it  You got people  Coming out of the woodwork  And they want  Basically they want to be dead  But in general  Overwhelmingly  People like right on  Because the mainstream media 
[01:20:30]  Wasn't touching this  They're just like  Oh he was a legend  And we should look at that  And blah blah blah blah blah blah  You also got to look at it  Realistically  That the people that are  Supporting you  Are the people that  Look at your tweets  And the people that are  Following you  And then the other people  Kind of have to find you  Because they're following  Certain keywords  And stuff like that  So they're the ones  That don't like you  And don't support you  There are a lot less of them  Available to your tweets  I  When I started tweeting  The Joe Pa stuff  I lost  Immediately over 200 people 
[01:21:00]  And by the end of the day  I gained  An extra  Three to four hundred  Oh wow  So I gained  Two hundred yesterday  Lost two hundred  And the people coming in  Were hearing about it  From elsewhere  Yeah  So they weren't even  Like fans of the show  They were like  Holy shit this guy is  You know  Tweeting some shit  And then they're writing  You know  I fully support  You know  The jokes you're making  And your stance  On this whole fucking thing  A lot of times people  Jimmy's right 
[01:21:30]  Most people were  Right on  Someone retweets you  And they read it  And they're not  Re-looking for you  But then they come  And make a remark  Yeah  Yeah  There were some  Boy there were some  Good ones that I was  Reading last night  People just  Hangry  And not making sense  He's the face of  Penn State football  Who gives a shit  At that point  I could care less  About anybody upset  By the Joe Pa  I literally  No  It's an impossibility  For me to be concerned  Less about their feelings  That chick you called 
[01:22:00]  Frederica Bimmel face  I was cracking up  And then I looked  At her tweets  She had a picture  Of her  And some other  Fat chick  In a bar  T-bowing  And the bar  Looked like  The shittiest  Fucking local  Gin mill  Bar rag  Hangout  Bitch bar  And she twittered  Something like  So and so's  Die but  Legends live forever  They don't live forever  They get lung cancer  When they don't report  Ass fucking  In a shower 
[01:22:30]  With a ten year old  Sorry  Yeah the good lord  Really took it  Quickly  He scooped that one  Up quickly  We predicted  I think  Specifically Anthony  Predicted his death  Well of course  You got that clip  This is from November  I think  November 10th  November 10th  Is what we said  That was him  Outside his home  I give him six months  Oh really  Really  Going on record  I give him six months  Yeah  This is  This is really stressful  For someone in their 80s  And him to just 
[01:23:00]  Sit there with that wife  Doesn't look like  A fucking  A load of fun either  Wow  It was about three months  I gave him  I gave him six  November 10th  Two and a half months ago  That was  Yeah about the doctor  He told him  He got three months to live  The guy said  I can't pay my bill  He gave him  Three months  We nailed  We nailed the Joe Pa  And the Andy Rooney  Yeah  I know they were older guys  But we said  Within  Andy Rooney  We said within a year as well  And I think  Was 
[01:23:30]  My prediction  Before the  News came out  About his  Cancer  Oh yeah  Cancer  Yeah that only came out  Not too long ago  I'm a busy guy  Yeah  So  Joe Pa  Yeah  Why don't we go to an alumni  A Penn State alumni  All righty  Joe in Pennsylvania  Joe  I love Jimmy's  College football song  Oh it's so stupid  They'll get rallied up  Hey  We're gonna root  For our university 
[01:24:00]  Gives a fuck  Drums horns  Drums horns  Drums horns  Boo  Boo  All right there sir  What's your Penn State alumni  That's right  I just want to share  With you guys  I got an email  From Penn State  And the alumni  The building  Yeah  And I just wanted  To share with you  It says  Legendary Penn State 
[01:24:30]  Football coach  Passed away  Coming from the president  And it just talks about  Grieving the loss  Of a man  Who has made us  A greater university  His dedication  To his players  And success  On the field  And his legendary  Commitment to education  Is unmatched  His life  Work and generosity  Will always be remembered  And the university  Plans to honor him  For his many contributions  And his remarkable  Life and legacy  So I just found  That intriguing  Way to say  His  His years 
[01:25:00]  At Penn State  But they don't touch  On the kid  Fucking scandal  At all  No  Oh no  As an alumni  I think he could  Handle that  No no  Look it's a shame  You know  He had an incredible  Legacy that  Got all fucked up  In the end  If he would have  Died a little sooner  Many many contributions  Oh if he died  A little sooner  They wouldn't be  Praising him on TV  Just enough time  Went by  Where they're like  Okay now we can  Look at him as  That great football coach  Right  All his remarkable  Things that he's done  As a human being  Let's remember him today 
[01:25:30]  Yeah I hear  He did a lot  A lot of good  But the problem is  Man this is a biggie  That he really  Didn't do much about  Like John Wayne Gacy  Painted  Yeah exactly  Sort of Hitler  Wonderful art  Yeah yeah  Hitler  Watch those painters  And this is not a case  Of steroid use  Where you go  You know what  He looked the other way  Which you could  Forgive him for  And you could say  Well it's the culture  You know  Teams are trying to  Get away with  As much as they can  Some get caught  And some don't  Or a sexual  Misconduct by a player  Alleged by a woman 
[01:26:00]  Or a female  Like an adult  Right  Like sexual misconduct  This is one of those things  Those are things  You can kind of go  Like alright  He made a bad move  But with this  And I'm not being  Someone said I was  Being holier than that  Kids annoy me  But when you're  Fucking a kid  You gotta go man  And he didn't  He didn't do  What he's supposed to do  So tough shit  About his legacy  And it's great  That he did  All these nice things  But I  And even listening  To his self-serving  Fucking press conferences  That doddering idiot 
[01:26:30]  Yeah  You know  I've had some good years  Who gives a shit  Really  That you've had good years  When you heard  Something that  Horrific was happening  You stuck your  Fucking stupid  Old man face  In the sand  Right  You worried about  The Penn State  Football program  And your legacy  Right  He should've went  To the cops  Or at least went  To Sandusky  And said  What the fuck  Are you doing  Right  Is this real  And he was so powerful  There  He could've got a lot done  He absolutely could've  You're talking about  How powerful this guy was  And he's basically 
[01:27:00]  The face of the university  Yeah  Fuck yeah  If he would've spoke up  A lot more  This whole thing  Would've been shut down  Football programs  Are much more important  Yeah well that's what  It comes down to  But no one wants  To talk about that  They had a lot to lose  So it's like  Alright let's try to hide  As much of this shit  As possible  And I guess he understood  That too  But as a man  Tough shit  Yeah  That's not even  A tough position to be in  You just have to speak up  The tough position  Is the hands against  That shower wall  Yeah exactly  That apparently 
[01:27:30]  Is the tough position  With the sound  Of the thwock thwock thwock  Of old man balls  Slapping on young  You know who was  Praising him  I was watching  Some of those  Political shows  Over the weekend  Oh  Jesse  Jackson  Oh  I thought it was  Jesse the body  Jesse Jackson  I was hoping he called up  Praising him  Before he said  What he had to say  Really  About the  Yeah  Why was he praising him  Huh  He was a great man  I'm sure it's online somewhere  He was a great man 
[01:28:00]  Jesse Jackson  How irrelevant  Is that guy  In this day and age  Ah they throw my TV still  How fucking irrelevant  Is he  Why can't  Why can't  People talk about this  Honestly  Jesse Jackson  Praising him  Without  And ignoring  You know  The elephant in the room  As we like to say  Uh huh  I mean you're  You're a preacher right  You probably could  Say something about that  He's not a fucking preacher  All that phony preacher shit  He's a self-serving  Fucking  Oh boy  I want to be a politician 
[01:28:30]  Let's go to Pittsburgh  Pittsburgh  What's up buddy  Hey I gotta call Jimmy out man  Him and his fucking  Hypocritical shit  Fucking Uncle Paul  Yes it's a bit sir  Oh is that all it is Jimmy  Is it  Yeah  Alright whatever  It's fucking bullshit Jimmy  And you know it  What's the hypocritical bit  I'm not sure  You're not even explaining yourself Andy  See there's not really a child  Being victimized here in the studio  Yeah I did  I'm not  I'm not knocking  Dude I'm not knocking someone  For making fun of pedophiles  Or doing tasteless humor 
[01:29:00]  That would make me a hypocrite  No Jimmy  But you're trivializing it  You don't have kids  If you had kids  You would  You'd be making pedophile jokes  Um  But I've had friends die of AIDS  And I make fun of that  I've had friends and family  Die of cancer  And I make fun of that  There's no subject  I won't make fun of  So you're wrong  I don't think so  You don't have to  I'm telling you  What you think is not  But the thing is  You want to ignore  Everything  All the good he's done  But then over this thing  You think he's a piece of shit 
[01:29:30]  But it's not just  Over this thing  It's way more than just  This thing  It went on for a decade  Right sir  Yeah  And he knew that  And he also knew  The guy was still around  The university  And I don't think  Even after he supposedly  Did what he was supposed to  Should have been fucking exiled  And I don't think  He should have fucking  Used his power  To get Jerry Sandusky  Far away from the university  To begin with  Yeah  He fucked up his legacy  It's a real shame  Because yeah  I guess he did do 
[01:30:00]  A lot of good up there  But he also did  A lot of bad  But no one wants to  Fucking point that out  I guess  Yeah  You're talking about  Innocent children  You got a point  Love the show  Oh thank you  You don't have to  He's gotta love the show  Yes  You're talking about  Innocent children  He was completely aware  It continued after that  Yeah  And completely aware  They barely did anything  To Sandusky  That's a shame  It certainly is a shame  Yeah 
[01:30:30]  Not going to the  Not going to the police  When you hear that shit  Going to this  Fucking  College  Board members  And  That's  That's not the real world  Like I don't even consider  That whole thing  With the college  Where they got like  The dean  And the president  And this guy  They're not  That's not the real world  No  That's in their little thing  When a crime happens  They don't handle it internally  Go to the fucking real police  Yeah  So he goes to the real jail  That's ridiculous 
[01:31:00]  Not the fake university  Fake university jail  Which is  The showers I guess  Yeah the showers  Well yeah that seems to be  And by the way  Let's be honest  He only won two championships  Yeah  He only won two  That's it  He was there almost 50 years  Yeah  Is that impressive really  No  Oh god  That's going to be  A lot of people  It's one in 25  Every 25 years  He won a championship  Every quarter century  He sucked  Shit  Really  He's only won two more than me 
[01:31:30]  Right  He started his coaching career  Right around the time  The Beatles landed in America  And only got two  And was coaching up until what  October?  November?  Yeah  Ironic that his lungs  Wound up looking like two footballs  See  Brown  Hard  Alright  Settle down people  Let's go to Al  Hey guys  That guy's a total asshole  For all the  Joe Paterno did a hundred great 
[01:32:00]  A thousand great things for Penn State  The one fucking thing he didn't do  Literally  He ruined his legacy forever  I mean how can people  How do you feel if you can praise him  And go there and do  You know  Stand by a statue  And light candles  And he totally shipped the bed  You know  He donated four million dollars  He didn't do the right fucking thing  That's what it is  And there's something even more important  Going on with your phone calls sir  Just bear with me  Stay in the line  I know there's plenty of you guys  Out there that 
[01:32:30]  You know  Think Joe Paterno  Really fucked up in this situation  But I really want to hear from the people  That are supporting Joe Pa  Yeah  Because I really want to get into their mindset  What does it say on the screen?  Al  That's you right Al?  Yes  From Maryland  Supporting Joe Pa  Supporting Joe Pa  No no no  The phone call  This couldn't be more wrong  Oh my god  I have no support for that guy at all  Who answered the phone?  Who did it?  Who's on phones?  That would be Paul  And what was it?  Oh Paul  Oh Paul 
[01:33:00]  You got it  Completely opposite  I've never supported Joe Paterno  Ever even  Before I found that he fucked up  Look we could take a hundred of these phone calls  Where you think Joe Pa didn't do the right thing  I really want to hear from the people that  Are supporting him and why  Yeah  I can handle it  As a show we can handle it  I want to see where your heads are at  So I'm a little nervous  Where are they?  There's thousands of them out there  But there will be  On the social media  Posting how great  You know this and that  Call it up  But you just put it out there  Here's your forum 
[01:33:30]  Let's see how much the phones light up  It's good  Support this asshole  Alright thank you brother  We got Joe Paterno's last interview  He said he didn't understand  How a little boy could be raped  Yeah  Is that true?  I guess not  How does Jimmy feel  About Roman Polanski  With him being an actor?  I've smashed Roman Polanski  And I've smashed the way  Fucking Hollywood lines up  To work with him  And they refuse  To criticize him  I don't think he's as bad  I mean a 13 year old girl  Is bad  You know 
[01:34:00]  It's  She was at the party  Some of the boys  Were 13 years old  Jimmy  Yeah I guess  Cause I guess it's  I can relate to that more  I guess a girl over a boy  I don't know  It's terrible  I do think that he should be  Fucking blacklisted  Even though he's a brilliant director  But it annoys me  The way Hollywood  Won't rally around Mel Gibson  And it's only because  He used the word nigger  That's why Mel Gibson  It's nothing to do with  Domestic violence  Or yelling  Cause Chris Brown  Beat the shit out of Rihanna  And nobody gives a fuck  It's because  He said nigger 
[01:34:30]  And he's passed Jews  Cause he was racist  Right  That's why Mel Gibson's  In big trouble  And he's in trouble  No one defends this guy  Roman Polanski  Fucked a 13 year old  In the ass  After drugging her  And they fly over  To work with him  That's pretty bad  Of course it is  So it's like  They're fucking kind of  Repugnant as well  That's true  But people have a weird  Thing with him  Because they know  Sharon Tate was his wife  And she was slaughtered  Yeah maybe you know 
[01:35:00]  He was able to  Heal himself  By having sex  With a fucking kid  I mean I don't know  Not that  But did he go off  The deep end  Or just fucking  Who knows  I mean it's a  One time thing  Maybe that's why  People are able  To look at him  A little differently  But I still  I think he's awful dude  Alright let me  This guy might be lying  So who knows  It's the only one though  Everyone else is  In agreement  In agreement  With what we're saying today  Ryan what do you got buddy  Yellow 
[01:35:30]  Oh Paul  Oh Paul  Oh Paul  Welcome to iWireless  Oh  We didn't dial  We didn't dial  No one  Traveled outside the calling  CR52  CR52 write that down  Message CR  Paul's not doing a good job  Oh you know what  He's shitting  No  Let's go to Dominic  In Columbus  Dominic  Alright  The dommer  Always the dommer  Hey man  Hey good morning gentlemen  How are you  Alright  Hey one thing 
[01:36:00]  I'm curious about  How come this  McQuarrie guy  That saw Sandusky  And the actual  Rape occur  How come he didn't  Step up  And you know  Acost Sandusky  And he's like  Being totally  Removed from the equation  I mean if that was me  I certainly would have  Did something  He's a fucking pussy  He worried more  About his football  Career as well  Yeah that guy's  Another asshole  Although he wasn't  In that authority figure  Yeah  Yeah  Low man the totem pole  And I think they can't  Fire him because of  The whistleblower  Law  Like when you blow  The whistle about something 
[01:36:30]  It's really hard  For a company  To get rid of you  Because  But another guy  That did  Name for a kid  Whistle  Oh no  If that doesn't show you  The culture of football  At that university  The football culture  Another guy that did  The bare minimum  Everyone was just scared  So they allowed  Some shit to go down  Yeah  Joe Pa  Just hate that whole thing  Like he's fucking  You know  The father figure  Yeesh 
[01:37:00]  Alright this guy  Is Ryan again  Ryan are you supporting  Joe Pa and why  Come on don't  It's the administration  That has the problem  Half of them are still there  Yeah that's true  Yeah that's a good point too  He reports it to them  They report it to the police  Yeah it was a little late  He reports it to the police  And the detective  The detective that took the case  Is dead now  His computer is missing  And nobody reports that  But you know that  Paterno didn't do  Morally what he should have done  Like 
[01:37:30]  He was in the  He reported it to the administration  He did it to the administration  Let's slow you down  He reports it  Hold on  Hold on  Let's slow you down  He reports it to the administration  Right  Then goes about his business  And realizes  I don't know  Maybe a week later  Maybe a couple months later  Holy shit  Nothing has changed  Yeah  How do you live with yourself  McClary is the problem  McClary is the one that saw it  Wow  I don't understand this  He wasn't answering  I just don't understand this  Well let me ask you a question  So on that campus  A crime 
[01:38:00]  Like no amount of power  Can save you from pedophilia  Ruining you  So you're telling me  On that campus  The allegations that a guy  Was fucking a 13 year old  In the ass  Should be reported  By you to your administrator  And not to the police  I'm telling you that  If you're the one that saw it  You should take it to the police  And not to the coach  Okay  That's fair  Yeah but he took it to the coach  So now the coach  Has to take it to the police  Don't you get that part of it  But because McClary  Didn't go to the police 
[01:38:30]  We're not talking about McClary  We're talking about Paterno  Who is much more powerful  And uh  You act like  He's the one  In the shower  Raping this kid  No I didn't  I'm acting like  That's the way you're asking  No Sandusky is the worst  In this whole situation  Nah  You dumb Penn State guys  Who just want to  Who want to worship this guy  Here's the reality  He didn't do what he should have done  Tough shit  About his legacy  I'm sure he was a good man  I'm sure he was  He did a lot of great things  For that part  Of that school  But when it came down 
[01:39:00]  He thought  And he chose  The fucking  Penn State football program  He knew  That this  A scandal of this magnitude  Would rock the university  And he chose  To fucking handle it  Quietly  Right  It's for the administration  So why don't you blame them  I'm not  I'm not  Not blaming them  Stay on him  Stop deflecting  You put it on Paterno  Paterno's the one  That got fired  No I'm only talking  About Paterno  Because he's the one  Who died  Yeah  We haven't even  Talked about this  In months  But because he died 
[01:39:30]  We're bringing it up  And there's not  A statue of the administration  Outside  McQuarrie  McQuarrie sucks  Jerry Sandusky's  The worst human being  In this whole situation  And of course  The nameless  Faceless administration  Guys are horrible  And those administration  Guys that didn't  Do anything  Why wouldn't he  Look at that  And like Jimmy said  Two or three months later  Go hey  What's happening  With this K  Why is this guy  Still walking around  Right  Why haven't you  What  Why would you  Desecrate a guy's legacy  After he dies 
[01:40:00]  Who gives a fuck  About his legacy  We're giving  Eight to ten reasons  Why  And first of all  We didn't wait  Till he died  By the way  This is the exact  Same conversation  We had when it all  Went down  How old the guy  And he was still alive  How old the guy  Are you  Me I'm 28  Turn down your  Fucking radio  Turn down your radio  Bro  We're trying to talk  To you but you can't  With the radio on  It makes it distracting  Don't worry  You're on the air  So you're 28 years old  Where'd you go to school  Mizzou  Where's that  University of Missouri 
[01:40:30]  Oh okay  Do you have any kids  I do not  Alright  I was going to ask  If you had a kid  How would you feel  Would you be happy  With the way he reacted  You keep pointing  Hold on  Hold on bro  You keep saying  That we're not  Attacking the administration  They're shit too  McQuarrie  He's in a weird position  Where he can't be fired  But the reality is  Just talking about Paterno  I didn't say the whole thing  Is his fault  He's the one who died  He's the one being  Called a legend  He's the one being  Focused on at this moment 
[01:41:00]  He didn't do  What he should have done  And you know that  Sure sure  He could have done more  Then that's all  You need to say  When it comes to a kid  Being fucked in the ass  That's enough  He should have done more  Is enough to go  His legacy  Doesn't matter  Sure  And if it was me  I would have reported it  You know I'm a nurse  It's mandatory reporting  We have to  We're healthcare  Girl job guy  But I'm also saying  You have to support  The guy's legacy  No I don't give a shit  About his legacy  His legacy 
[01:41:30]  Doesn't mean anything to me  Because I'm sure he did  Thousands of kids  That he got through college  That have degrees now  That have went on  To the NFL  Absolutely  Dude  Kids were being  Okay  Kids were being fucked  Under his watch  Yeah  That kind of wipes out  Pretty much your life  Yeah  Unfortunately  And I love the people  That try to attack  Well they  They try to attack me  Like oh I guess  You're morally perfect  No  None of us are  But this goes way  Beyond that shit  This goes beyond  A moral imperfection 
[01:42:00]  And he did do a lot  Of great things  And yeah  Great  But the bottom line is  He dropped the ball  So badly  And it wasn't  It was like  He  This continued  This wasn't something  That happened  This didn't happen  Two weeks ago  This was years later  And he saw Sandusky  Around campus  He knew  Dude  He's not a dumb guy  He knew  I guess you just have to  Disagree on this  I mean  Okay  That's fine  So you think  It's more important  To choose the legacy 
[01:42:30]  And the image of the school  Over  Risking  Giving Penn State  A black eye  By going to the police  You don't think  He should have went  To the cops with that  I think it's more important  In the wake of his death  To support what he did there  Over the 50 years  He was there  Okay  Again  You absolutely  And talk about this  When it happened  Yeah  And if he was alive  You'd be saying  The same thing  Who gives a shit  About his death  Like all of a sudden  That changes anything  Right  We said the same stuff  I'll say it again 
[01:43:00]  When he was alive  Hey Ryan  Do you think  Paterno let those kids down  No  Oh Jesus  Okay  Ryan thinks  That if  You were being  Fucked in the ass  In the shower  When you were 10  Him going to the  The head of the university  Would have been good enough  For you  Huh Ryan  If it was important  And it wasn't  No no  I didn't ask you that  I already said  I already said  He could have done more  That you're a dummy  That you're dumb  Ryan do you understand  I'm probably a shitty nurse  Do you understand  How despicable 
[01:43:30]  Child fucking is  Yeah  In this world  Do you understand  When you go to  When you go to prison  Do you understand  That other prisoners  Look at you  Like you're a scumbag  Because that's why  You're in there  Sandusky should be  Getting fucked in the ass  Every day  Of course he should  He should be fucking  No  But what about Sandusky  He did some good things  He didn't do anything good  No  But I mean  He helped  He helped  The legacy  Wasn't he a great  Wasn't he a great  Assistant coach  You don't want to  Acknowledge that today  Ryan  That's true  What about all the good  No because I don't 
[01:44:00]  Think he ever was  Oh really  People that know  A lot more about football  Than me and you  Would say he absolutely  Was a great assistant coach  And that's their  Fucking opinion  That's not mine  That's too  Whatever  If you think this way  That's fine  Stats don't back that up  I don't care about stats  Here's the bottom line  He didn't do enough  When he heard a 10 year old  Was being fucked in the ass  You get in line  With the rest of the  Dumbbells  And think  That the important thing  Is the legacy 
[01:44:30]  The important thing  Is  He did a good job  At the university  When he heard a kid  Was being fucked in the shitter  He did nothing  Or some will say he did  He did nothing  Just to be fair  Everybody knows  He did nothing  He either did nothing  Or the minimum  He was bigger  Than the fucking  University administration  And he knew it  If he went to the administration  And said look  This kid fucker  He either goes  Or I go  They would have been like  Alright we'll get him  To pack his fucking bag 
[01:45:00]  And by the way  Let me ask you something  If Paterno was assaulted  Walking into work one day  By a student  If a student  Punched him in the face  Do you think Paterno  Just would have went  To the university president  Or do you think  He would have went  To the police  Good point  What do you think  He would have done  That's something that happens  In front of a bunch of people  No alone  Say he was alone  What do you think  He would have done  Say he's alone  In the middle  Of a 60,000 person campus  I didn't mean at the game  You dumb  Yeah he was walking  Into work one night  He gets punched in the face  By a student  Or two students  And then he sees a cop 
[01:45:30]  Is he going to go  To the police  Or is he going to go  To the university president  And report the crime  Well as you said  If he sees a cop  I guess he's going to the cop  You understand  What you're doing  You just  You want to fucking  Talk about legacy  And all that nonsense  And you know  It's idiocy  I mean no  You missed the point  Because all I said  Was that  In the wake of his death  You support his legacy  Before and after  You talk about  What happened there  Fuck his legacy  That's a legacy  Fuck his legacy  This 
[01:46:00]  This stains his legacy  Everyone who's done  Terrible things  Has done things right  Bro  Yeah alright  Hey  More credit  He's got a statue  For what he did right  He's been praised  For what he did right  Unfortunately  Six months before his death  This story blew up  Unfortunately  For his legacy  The story of him  Not doing anything  When he heard  That there was a  A man's penis  And a boy's hiney  In his locker room 
[01:46:30]  And he didn't do  The right thing  Ah  So the legacy  Takes a hit  Sorry  No  So the administrator  Can save their job  Ah  No the  That's  No  Okay  No no no  That has to do  So the school  Can save faith  Okay  You believe that  If Joe Paul  Went to the cops  Perhaps the administrators  Wouldn't have been able  To save their job  Hold on  Let's talk about  Your life there sir  So you're a nurse  You said  Yeah  And you have to report  Child fucking right  You report anything 
[01:47:00]  Child abuse  Alright let's say  Wherever you work  You hear that someone  No you saw it  You saw someone  Getting fucked in the shower  Right  And you  Go to your  Superiors  And you report it  Right  And then let's  Fast forward  Let's fast forward  A month  And you realize  Holy shit  The guy  That was fucking  The child  They really didn't  Do much about it  He's still here  So what would you do  Then sir  If it's already  Been a report  To the authorities  There's nothing  I can do  Oh my god  You can go 
[01:47:30]  To the police  I so don't want  To hang out with you  Liar liar  Pants on fire  Pants on fire  So you would be okay  Continuing your job  Hold on  Let me fucking finish  Working with this guy  You would be okay  Continuing to work  With this person  Knowing what happened  And knowing you reported  And they didn't do anything  They did let's say  The minimum  You'd be okay with that  That's what you're saying  Today Ryan  Ethically you feel  You've done your job  Of course not  But if it's reported  Authorities  Then you can't do anything  But you would just move  About your life  After that right 
[01:48:00]  And go oh well  I reported it  That's all I care about  You wouldn't go back  To the authorities  Go out and kill the guy  And go to prison  No you wouldn't go back  To the authorities  And say how come  Two months later  This fucking pervert  Is still working  In this hospital  Or at this point  Go wow  Maybe I should go  To the actual police  Because I went  To my superiors  And they don't seem  To be taking this seriously  Oh see by the authorities  When it's reported  Say that situation  Did happen  It's not only reported  To the administrator  Of the hospital  But you also report  It directly to the authorities 
[01:48:30]  At that time  You're probably lousy  At your job  Like if you're a nurse  And you feel this way  Like you actually think  That he  You're probably lousy  At your job  Yeah  By reporting it  To the cops  And the administrator  That's not doing your job  But he didn't report it  He didn't  That's just it  We're talking about me  We're talking about me  We're not talking about Joe Paterno  No but the fact that you think  That he did the right thing  I'm a terrible person  I thought you were  A terrible person  I said you're probably  Lousy at your job  Because if you're supposed  To be  How so  Because I do it  I'm explaining to you  How so  Because if you think 
[01:49:00]  That Joe Paterno  Did what was okay  And you think  The legacy is more important  Even though you know  He didn't do morally  What he should have done  You're probably  I'm glad  I'm not in your care  Because you're probably  Not very good at it  Yeah  That's my opinion of you  Yeah  Yeah  Well that's your opinion  I guess  Yes it is  I'm glad  I take damn good care  And I have a 95% approval  I'm sure you do  But the 5%  I bet are doozies  Those are the ones  Who probably  Put the pillow on their faces 
[01:49:30]  Alright whatever  Jesus  But I mean  In the Penn State University situation  Obviously it wasn't good enough  Just going to the superiors  Or the administration  And that's where  We have the problem  At that point  Joe Paterno  Is forced to go  To the fucking real police  When he realizes  Not much is going on  About the situation  Or  Yeah  Go wrangle up  Some bedpans  Something just fell  Miss  He's gone  I guess  Yeah  He couldn't take anymore  What are you 
[01:50:00]  When you're talking  To that mentality  What about there  What about there  What about there  What about there  Okay  Fine  Harp on the legacy  Go there  And look at that statue  And hold a candle  And talk about it  Like these dumb motherfuckers  On the news are doing  Look at him  Look  His legacy  And the university's legacy  Is tainted  It sucks  Tough shit  Tough shit  It happens  How about an armacy  How about a shoulder  See  We could do this all day  Leg M 
[01:50:30]  It's too bad  Because it looks like  He was a really good coach  I don't think he was  A really good man  I'm sure  Yeah  How about  How about  I can't see  I can  I'm forgetting  Oh and that fits in  Because he had glasses  Turned a blind eye  To the situation  Because he had glasses  Exactly  As simple as this  Kids are being fucked  Under your watch  That pretty much  Ruins your legacy  Sorry  If you were told about it  Sorry  Does that even have to be said  Yes  It's like  That's what amazes me  But that's just it  It's so  It's so obvious  That's what amazes me 
[01:51:00]  Yes  You have to say that  It's amazing  You know  But I mean  The good news  Overwhelmingly  The world I live in  People are agreeing  With what we're saying  Yeah  Because I just  I try to see things  The other way  Yeah  Now that I'm older  And on this one  I just can't  Wrap my head around it  I think the people  That people would think this way  I just  I can't  The people that are  Really supporting him  I think are the people  That looked up to him  Either went to the school  Or  Followed the team 
[01:51:30]  Right  New for years  Like oh this guy's  A great coach  Like I don't really  Think it's just  People looking at the facts  And saying  Oh this guy is great  They're looking at other factors  Yeah  And it's like  Just fucking revolting  Especially when I listen  To this jerk off talk  And I mean Paterno  Talked in interviews recently  He wouldn't even talk  Sincerely about  What was going on  Let the police  How about going  If he did this  He should be shot 
[01:52:00]  How about you address  A pedophile  Yeah  Real tough talking  Football coach  I don't know  I don't know  We got Donahue  It says  Let me set this call up  For you Donahue  Thank you  I support Joe Paul 1  Jim is wrong 2  Okay  I'm an attorney 3  And I'm running  For Penn State's  Board of Trustees  Correct  Yep  Okay  Go ahead Donahue  All right  First of all  I appreciate you guys  And everything 
[01:52:30]  And I appreciate your stance  Jim  The reason why  I just called in  Is some of the stuff  That you were stating  Was wrong  Okay  First of all  Can I get a disclaimer  First that no matter  What is said during this call  You will not sue us  You already asked me  That one time  And I'll give you  Same disclaimer  Now  Okay  So you won't  Yeah I will not sue  Thank you  All right  And also  My disclaimer  Everything here  Is based upon  What has been released  From the grand jury  Testimony and papers 
[01:53:00]  As the transcript  Has not been released yet  Okay  From any of the  Four grand juries  That have been convened  All right  How grand are they really  They're good juries  Nothing sir  Continue  Now that you've put  Everyone to sleep  What is the purpose  Of your phone call  All right  Joe Pott  Did report it  To the police  The individual  That one of the  Two individuals  Who's now being  Charged with perjury  Was in charge  Of the state campus police 
[01:53:30]  Which is a fully licensed  Police authority  Within the state  Of Pennsylvania  Same as Philadelphia police  Same as Pittsburgh  Right  Well  They are a school  Police department  But yeah  I understand  They're real cops  Technically  On paper  Now  What happened from there  Is he was told  That the report  Would be followed  All right  Granted  He didn't call  On a Sunday  He called on a Monday  When he found out  Sunday or whatever  That's  You know  Neither here nor there 
[01:54:00]  All right  That is the one place  That Joe Paterno  Did not act  Immediately  In my opinion  All right  From there  What Joe Paterno  Did  Is he followed up  With the individuals  And was told  That an investigation  Was underway  Now  From the testimony  That was released  From the  Perjury case  That happened  At the preliminary charges  For Curly and Schultz  They read a portion  Of Joe Paterno's testimony  And not the entire thing  All right 
[01:54:30]  What they released  Is that Joe Paterno  Did call the police  Yeah  That Joe Paterno  Was a full participant  In the investigation  And that Joe Paterno  Did do everything  That he was supposed to do  So let me ask you  Let me jump in  And ask you  Because I've heard that  And I've heard that  That was not true  And so let me ask you  Based on what you're saying  Why would  Why would it be seen  Because the  The university  The last thing  They wanted to do  Was  Was fire Joe Paterno 
[01:55:00]  Because it just makes  Them look guilty  And terrible  So if what you're saying  Is true  And he did do  Everything  Why is the university  Taking the position  That he did not  Meet his moral obligation  Well Jim  You're correct there  And you are incorrect  Okay  Joe Paterno  Had made the board  Of trustees  In Grant Spaniard  Aware that he was  Retiring  In August  Of the year  There are numerous  Trustees  That have acknowledged that  And there are also  Numerous people 
[01:55:30]  In the head  Hierarchy  That acknowledge that  He pissed off  The board of trustees  Because when he  Was going to retire  He gave them  A list of four names  On that name  Was people  Who he wanted  To follow after him  One was  Urban Myers  Who's now  With Ohio State  He pissed them  Off there  They thought  That Joe Paterno  Went over their head  And told them  How to do their job  They were gunning  For him  On numerous things  I know it's  Conspiracy theory  And you guys  You know  Yeah dude 
[01:56:00]  Gunning for him  Hold on bro  Gunning for him  Because he did a few  Things they didn't like  That's kind of hard  To put with  They threw him  To the wolves  Over child molesting  This scandal  Because it doesn't  Just hurt Paterno  It's in everybody's  Best interest  In the university  For him to retire  In good standing  Because he is  A legendary football coach  This does not  Behoove them at all  Joe Paterno never retired  Joe Paterno  To the moment he passed 
[01:56:30]  Was an employee  Of Penn State University  Well they fired him  The board of trustees  Have released that  No  Okay  He was a tenured professor  And I believe it was  When Erickson  Was doing his  Tour around  The grand hall  The town hall meetings  The board of trustees  Released a statement  The Tuesday of the week  That he was doing it  Saying that Joe Paterno  Was not fired  That Joe Paterno  Was a tenured professor  For the university  So he had to go  And he still was employed 
[01:57:00]  Okay so I guess  What had to happen there  Is he had to go  Through a due process  Once you're tenured  You have to go  Through a due process  I'm sure  Because it's harder  For them to get rid of you  So maybe they legally  Couldn't fire him  But he was no longer  The football coach  I can't give you  A yes or no  I don't do employment law  On that  So  Well but I mean  If you're  They relieved him  From his position  Why they  Okay so  Isn't that kind of  Tantamount to being fired  You're going to get  In the legal semantics  Which is all  No I'm not  Dude I'm not getting 
[01:57:30]  Into the semantics  Of it  I'm saying  If they say  You're no longer  The coach  Isn't that the same  As being fired  Because technically  If he's a tenured professor  They probably have to go  Again like I keep saying  Dupe  They have to go  Through some kind  Of a process  To fire him  It probably  You know  That takes time  But what they  Could do immediately  Is remove him  As football coach  Why would they  Remove him  As football coach  One day before  He was supposed  To be finished  That's a firing  One day  I'm sorry  I apologize  One game  No he had 
[01:58:00]  Four more games  It was going to be  His last home game  Oh okay  Four more games  Alright there you go  So why would they  Do that  The reason why  Is because  You got a safe  Face basically  At that point  They fired  Grant Spanier  Well no  They actually  Met a joint  Opinion  Between Grant  Spanier  And the board  Of trustees  That Grant Spanier  Was to step down  Okay  Now you also  Have to look  At what's  Happened since then  The vice chair  And the chair  Of the board  Of trustees 
[01:58:30]  Have also  Rolled over  And there's now  Two new chairs  Erickson  Who was once  A board  Of trustee  Member  Was then  Appointed to  The sitting  President  And he will  Be until  2014  Now  So what that  Means is  On the face  It looks like  They cleared  What they need  To do  For their  Hierarchy  And say  Oh look  We're making  Changes  We're making  Changes  The only  Person left  Was Joe  Paterno  And there  Was such  A media  Firestorm  That they  Had no  Other choice  But to 
[01:59:00]  Cut off  That  The face  Of Penn  State  Which was  Joe  Paterno  Right  Right  But  I'm reading  Something here  About  Paterno's  I'm sorry  As we're  Talking  I'm perusing  Something  Where Paterno  Himself  Said he  Didn't want  To interfere  With certain  People's  Weekends  So he  Reported  That's what  I said  The Sunday  Yeah  That's what  I said  One Sunday  Right  He was  Notified  By 
[01:59:30]  McQuarrie  It was  Either late  Saturday night  Or early  Sunday morning  He did not  Make that  Call Sunday  Like I said  That is  When Joe  Paterno  Did not  Act immediately  I don't even  Fault him  For needing  A day  To process  It's a Sunday  We'll talk  Monday  You know  I don't even  Fault that  I don't think  That he  Went to the  Police though  I think  He did  He did  Curly  And Schultz  One was  The athletic  Director  And had  The ability  To remove 
[02:00:00]  Sandusky  From the  Football buildings  The other  Was the  Vice President  Of Finances  And ran  The  Vice President  Because  Police  What?  What happened  What?  I don't know  You fell apart  There a little bit  Yeah  I tripped up  But I also  Think that  Cutting off  Joe Paterno  Does nothing  But hurt  The university  And the  Board of trustees  Doing that  Is  An absolute 
[02:00:30]  Defeat  It's not  Throwing him  To the wolves  It's not like  Any other  Political situation  That is a  Terrible  That almost  Makes the  University  Blemish  Concrete  And  Unchangeable  It's pathetic  It's pathetic  On their part  Because they  Knew  As well  And now  Like well  We'll save  Our own  Asses  By firing  Paterno  A lot of  Shitty things  Happened to  Paterno  As well  There in the  End  But  I can't  I can't see  Where it said  Paterno  Talked to the  Police  Adam  Hold on  Adam's on 
[02:01:00]  The line  He says  I'm an  Attorney  As well  He's missing  Major points  Joe Pa  Recommended  People to  Sandusky's  Charity  As well  Is that  True  Donahue  Is that  True  Joe Pa  Recommended  People  To  His  Charity  In what  Way  I was hoping  We didn't  Have to  Have two  Lawyers  On at  The same  Time  Because  That's  Death  But  Adam  What do  You got  You're on  With  Donahue  Yeah  Even if  Everything  This guy  Says is  True  It doesn't  Matter  Because  After 
[02:01:30]  Everything  Happened  They were  Still  Sending  All of  The  Players  According  To  Paul  Who  Was  A linebacker  They were  Sending  The players  To  Sandusky's  Charity  As late  As 2007  So even  If all  That's  True  Why  Would  You  Allow  Sandusky  To  Continue  To  Be  Part  Of  The  Program  He  Was  At  The  University  On  A  Daily  Basis  After  This  Not  Like  He  Got  Cut  Off  That  Day  He  Was  Still  In  And  Around  The  Program  And  Penn  State  Players  Still  Went  To  Sandusky's  Charity  That's  Where  It  Gets  Really  Fucked  Up  And  That's 
[02:02:00]  What  The  Problem  Is  Not  What  Happened  Legally  Sir  For  The whole  Second  Mile  Issue  First  Of  All  You  Have  To  Look  At  One  How  Involved  Sandusky  Was  With  Second  Mile  And  The  Issues  That  They  Were  Going  There  Second  Mile  Organizations  Throughout  The  State  Of  Pennsylvania  Okay  Just  As  There's  Branch  Campuses  For  Penn  State  Throughout  The  State  Of  Pennsylvania  Right  By  Having  The  One  Person  Around  Doesn't 
[02:02:30]  Mean  That  That  Entire  Charity  Is  Faulted  Now  When  I'm  Saying  That  You  Gotta  Look  At  This  There  Was  Numerous  Things  Going  On  With  Second  Mile  That  Nobody  Can  Explain  Why  Did  Corbett  Approved  Multi-million  Dollars  State  Funds  To  Be  Granted  To  Them  Why  Did  Tom  Corbett  Allow  Them  To  Have  Access  To  State  Grants  And  State  Grounds  There's  A lot  Of  Things  That  You  Can't  Answer  Yeah  The  Whole  Point  Of  Your  Explanation 
[02:03:00]  Is  To  Just  Confuse  The  Issue  The  Fact  Is  Sam  Dusky  Was  Allowed  Back  On  Campus  After  This  Parting  It  Not  Reporting  It  Properly  Whatever  Happened  There  What  I'm  Saying  The  Point  Is  Yes  That  He  Is  Still  Allowed  There  It's  Crazy  The  Most  Powerful  Man  At  The  University  Allows  Sandusky  On  Campus  And  The  Facilities  In  The  Facilities  And  I  Cannot  Find  One  Place  That  Says  Paterno  All  I'm  Seeing  Reading  About  Paterno  And  This  Is  From  The  Pennsylvania  How  Player  Interviews 
[02:03:30]  That's  A  Place  To  Look  Player  Interviews  Saying  He's  There  Saying  He  Was  There  Like  I said  Post  He  Said  He  Was  There  Late  As  2007  The  Pennsylvania  Attorney  General  Even  Saying  I  Apologize  For  Interrupting  You  That  Paterno  Did  His  Legal  Responsibility  When  He  Went  To  His  Administrators  I  Can't  Find  Anywhere  That  Says  Paterno  Went  To  The  Police  Sir  Except  For  You  On  The  Phone  Go  Look  At  Schultz's  Positions  He  Was  Head  Of  State  College  Police  Department  So  Nothing  And  That's  Where  It's  All  Bullshit

[02:04:30]  Years  After  This  You  Can't  Deny  That  Technically  They  Might  Have  Changed  His  Position  Here  And  There  But  The  Fact  Is  He  Was  Around  The  Team  For  Many  Years  After  This  If  We  Keep  These  Guys  On  For  Another  Minute  We  Have  To  Pay  15  More  Minutes  Actually  They  Only  Do  Quarter  Hours  These  Motherfuckers  Not  Two  Tenths  Of  An  Hour  Your  Attorney  Got you  In  That  Divorce  Yeah  Certainly  Did  Thank you  Two  Tenths  Of  An  Hour  And  Why  Let  Let  Me  Ask  You  Why  Would  You  If  You  Running  For  Why

[02:06:00]  With  Him  And  Two  More  Months  Go  By  We  Might  Go  Why  Is  E-Rock  Still  Here  And  Fuck  That  It's  Morally  Perfect  We  We're  Making  That  Point  We  Agree  With  You  There  But  Let's  Keep  It  With  The  Kid  Fucking  Thing  Okay  That's  A  Biggie  That's  A  Huge  One  And  I  Agree  With  That  That  I  Would  Absolutely  Fucking  Put  My  Own  Fucking  Job  On  The  Line  To  Make  Sure  I  Did  Everything  I  Possibly  Could 
[02:06:30]  Now  And  At  That  Point  If  They  Still  Didn't  Do  Anything  I  Would  Have  To  Leave  My  Job  I  Would  Not  Be  A  Part  Of  That  Shit  Period  And  I  Also  Would  Believe  In  My  Abilities  Where  I  Would  Be  Able  To  Go  Somewhere  And  Do  What  I  Love  To  Do  Which  Is  Radio  And  In  Paterno's  Case  I  Truly  Believe  Someone  Else  Would  Have  Fucking  Picked  Them  Up  I  Don't  Know  They  Were  Trying  To  Get  My  To  In  The  90s  You  You  Kind  Of  Right  About  That  You  Gotta  Remember  He 
[02:07:00]  Was  You  Know  He  Was  Already  Pretty  Old  At  The  Point  At  That  Point  Right  But  Still  But  I  Mean  And  The  Other  Thing  Is  Review  What  McQuarrie  Said  At  The  Preliminary  Hearing  He  Said  That  He  Saw  Inappropriate  Things  Never  Said  Rake  And  That's  Another  Bullshit  Thing  Because  Here's  What  McQuarrie  Said  Take  Any  Adverb  Or  Adjective  You  Went  Out  Of  There  McQuarrie  Said  Shower  Sandusky  Kid  Put  Anything  Else  You  Want  In  There  He  Fucking  Fired  Immediately

[02:08:30]  Well  Oh  Even  The  Jury  Laughing  Even  The  I  Object  Can  We  Strike  That  Oh  Okay  Make  Believe  You  Didn't  Hear  That  I  Watch  Yeah  He  Said  I'm  Reading  That  Paterno  Did  Contact  The  Guy  He  Talked  To  Gary  Schultz  Was  He  Was  Kind  Of  A  Double  Duty  Guy  Yeah  Right  See  He  Was  Senior  Vice  President  And  He 
[02:09:00]  Also  Oversaw  The  Police  Department  Yeah  Okay  What  Was  His  Rank  As  A  Cop  He  Basically  Was  In  Charge  Of  Being  Counter  He  Was  Basically  The  Was  He  A  Cop  Commissioner  Of  State  College  Police  As  Far  As  I  Understand  Was  He  A  Cop  Well  You  Should  Know  That  I  Mean  He  Was  A  Cop  Or  He  Was  I  I  Don't  Know  What  He  Really  I  I'm  A  Cop  You  Idiot  What  Exactly  Was

[02:10:00]  Says  The  School  Senior  Vice  President  For  Finance  And  Business  Which  Gives  Him  Oversight  You're  Saying  To  Me  Now  But  You're  Saying  That  Joe  Paterno  Did  Go  To  The  Head  Cop  But  The  Guy  Who  Is  In  Charge  Of  Finance  For  The  University  And  Thereby  Technically  Oversees  The  Police  I  Think  That's  Kind  Of  Being  I  I  Don't  Think  That's  Accurate  Man  Come 
[02:10:30]  On  That  It  Is  Because  Of  The  Way  That  The  State  College  Runs  Their  Fucked  Up  Bureaucracy  And  How  He  Gets  To  Who  He  Is  Able  To  Report  To  So  Is  He  A  Police  Officer  Or  Not  Yes  He  Has  A  Role  As  A  Police  Officer  So  He  Carries  A  Gun  And  He's  A  Cop  Not  All  Cops  Carry  Guns  Donnie  Let me  Ask  You  A  Personal  Question  Sir  Why  Would  You  Want  To  Run  For  The  Penn  State 
[02:11:00]  Board  Of  Trustees  Why  Why  Would  You  Rather  Than  Apologizing  Like  They've  Been  Doing  And  Not  Making  Changes  I'd  Rather  See  Them  He's  A  Water  Walker  Y'all  Love  Donnie  Y'all  Love  Paternal  You  Know  What  You  Answered  The  Question  Now  Hold  I'm  Looking  To  See  Is  Gary  Schultz  Technically  A 
[02:11:30]  Cop  Maybe  He  Is  But  The  Thing  About  Overseeing  In  Charge  Of  Finance  Thereby  Technically  You  Oversee  Was  He  In  Charge  Of  Assignments  And  Cases  Or  Just  The  Finances  Was  He  An  Accountant  For  The  Police  Or  Was  He  Actually  Literally  Going  Out  There  Talking  With  The  Brass  Assigning  People  To  Cases  And  You  Know  That  There's  A  Big  Difference  There  Well 
[02:12:00]  Let  Me  Ask  You  Who's  The  Head  Of  Our  Military  Barack  Hussein  Obama  Correct  Surprised  You  See  What I  Mean  Oh  Boy  Oh  Boy  I'm  Not a  Barack  Saying  It  All  I  Know  What  You're  Saying  I'm  Just  Saying  That  Was  A  Lawyer  Thing  You  Just  Pulled  On  Me  Yeah  But  I'm  Not  And  I  Because  Technically  To  Me  You're  Kind of  Playing  As  Semantics  I'm  I'm  Trying  I'm  Trying to 
[02:12:30]  See what  I don't  Want to  Say  Something  That's  Not  Accurate  Which  I've  Done  Many  Times  I  Do  Not  Know  The  Real  Jim  Norton  At  Gmail  Dot  Com  Okay  I'll  Send  You  Some  Stuff  Later  On  Okay  I  Appreciate  You  Calling  In  Child  Porn  Yeah  Let's  Thank  Any  Photos  Of  Sandusky  Victims  Please  Quickly  Send  Them  To  Me  Let's  Thank  Let's  Thank  The  Kid  Fucker  Supporter  For  Calling  Our  Show  Donahue  Good 
[02:13:00]  Luck  To  You  As  Far  As  Running  For  The  Penn  State  Board  Of  Trustees  He's  Got  The  Board  Part  But  Because  He  Oversees  The  Financing  Of  The  Police  Department  To  Me  That's  Kind  Of  A  Fucking  Technical  Like  That's  Not  That's  Again  That's  Covering  Your  Bases  To  Say  You  Did  It  But  That's  Not  Really  Doing  It  Um  Let's  See  Alright  We're  Done  With  Him  Alright  Well  You  Guys  Have  A  Good  Day  And  I'm 
[02:13:30]  Gonna  Punch  Out  Alright  This  Says  Nothing  About  Someone  The  Police  Yeah  Dude  It  Says  Gary  Schultz  University  Police  But  It's  Like  Office  Of  Human  Resources  Office  Of  Internal  Audit  He's  In  Charge  Of  Everything  Financially  He's  A  Financial  Finance  Guy  That's  Not  Going  To  The  Police  That's  Not  Going  To  The  Police  The  Finances  Of  What  Penn  State  And  If  The  Guy  Was  Finances  Is  He  In  Charge  Penn  State  And  That  Covers  University  Police  He's  Got 
[02:14:00]  A lot  To  Lose  To  But  It  Doesn't  Say  A  Big  Scandal  Like  This  Would  Certainly  Affect  The  Finances  And  With  The  Point  The  Guy  Brought  Up  With  Barack  Obama  Being  Head  Of  The  Military  Yeah  But  If  You  Have  A  Fire  Base  That  Wants  To  Lob  Some  Shells  In  Somewhere  You're  Not  Calling  Barack  For  Coordinates  You know  There  Are  Other  People  That  Do  The  Job  A  Little  Better  Depending  On  What  You  Need  Done  And  If  You  Want  To  Go  And  Say  That  A  Man  Is  A  Child  And  He  Still  Works  Here  You  Go  To  The  Police  Not  The  Finance  And  Also  When  A  Guy  Like 
[02:14:30]  Paterno  Meets  A  Guy  Like  This  Or  A  Guy  Like  I  Don't  Want  To  Say  His  Name  The  Other  Guy  That  Those  Are  Guys  Who  Are  All  Going  What  Are  We  Going  To  Do  Here  That's  Not  Reporting  The  Crime  That's  Fucking  A  Couple  Of  Guys  Doing  Damage  Control  Because  Paterno  Is  Not  A  Regular  Coach  Going  To  A  Regular  Board  Of  Trustees  This  Is  Again  Like  Someone  Is  The  Most 
[02:15:00]  You  Know  What  Do  You  Think  Travis  What  Do  You  Think  Dr.  Gay  Well  Cause  They  Call  Him  Dr.  Gay  I  Was  In  The  Bathroom  For  A  Little  Bit  Of  This  So  I  Don't  We  Been  Doing  It  For  45  Minutes  No  But  I  Mean  I  Came  Back  To  My  Computer  And  Sam  Said  Too  Much  Cheese  As  You  Watched  Your  Ravens  Lose  So  From  What  I  Understand  From  Joe  Paterno's  Deposition  That  Was  Read  In  Court  He  Contacted 
[02:15:30]  Curly  And  Curly  Said  I  Didn't  Think  It  Was  A  Crime  So  I  Didn't  Report  It  No  I  Know  That  But  What  About  Gary  Schultz  Did  Paterno  Talk  To  Him  Did  They  Just  Have  A  Sit  Down  Nothing  That  I've  Read  Said  That  Paterno  Talked  To  Schultz  I  Got  In  Gary  Schultz  Let's  Go to  Dan  Pittsburgh  Dan  Hey  Boys  Hi  Dan  Hey  Jimmy  You're  Absolutely  Right  Gary  Schultz  Is  Not  A  Cop  He  Has  No  Arrest  Power  He  Doesn't  Have  An  Act  120  Certification  Which  Every  Police  Officer  In  The  Vice 
[02:16:00]  President  Of  Finance  Right  So  He  Has  No  Arresting  Power  So  That  Lawyer  Was  Basically  Who  Called  Up  Was  Being  Technical  Going  Oh  He  Reported  It  To  The  Head  Of  The  Police  Because  He  Happens  To  Oversee  The  Finance  But  Meanwhile  There's  A lawyer  Using  Semantics  Exactly  That  Guy  Gary  Schultz's  Interest  Is  Much  More  In  The  University's  Best  Interest  As  Opposed  To  This  Is  What's  Fucking  Legal  And  We're  Going  Arrest  You  For  Doing  This  Also  The  Lawyer  That  Called  In 
[02:16:30]  Jason  Has  A  Problem  This  Guy  Cannot  Call  In  As  A  Lawyer  And  Say  Things  Like  Oh  Whatever  I  Would  Love  Him  As  Back  To  The  Paterno  Was  Assaulted  Idea  If  Paterno  Was  Assaulted  Would  He  Is  This  The  Guy  He  Would  Have  Gone  To  Or  Would  He  Have  Gone  To  You  Go  To  The  Finance  Guy  You  Go  To  Not  Even  The  Campus  Police  You  Go  To  Real  Police  Enough  That's  Like  Some  Shit  Going  Down  Here  And  We  Would  Go  To 
[02:17:00]  Gary  Or  Rob  That's  Nonsense  We  Know  Those  Guys  Have  No  Power  Or  They  Can't  Do  Anything  About  The  Situation  Chances  Are  They  Were  The  One  In  The  Shower  How  About  This  It's  Like  We  Would  Go  Right  To  Fucking  Mal  Or  Scott  How  About  It's  Not  Those  We  Want  To  Have  A bit  Done  Right  We  Want  To  Do  A bit  And  We  Go  Down  The  Hall  To  Them  And  Ask  Them  To  Get  It  All  Ready  And  Together  And  Three  Months  Later  Right  We  Go  To  Them  And  There's  Still  No  Sign  Of  It  Ever  Getting  Done  Right  Oh  This  Has  Happened  Before  I  Was  Trying  To  Come  Up  With  A  Hypothetical  Or 
[02:17:30]  It's  Something  You  Want  To  You  Want  To  Work  In  Your  Favor  Yeah  Then  You  Would  Go  To  Gary  And  Rob  Oh  Right  Knowing  That  Steve  Scott  And  Mel  Would  Never  Hear  About  It  Yeah  See  How  That  Works  See  That's  Exactly  How  It  Works  Sam  So  Don't  Give  Me  That  Stupid  Look  Oh  That's  Just  His  Face  That's  Just  His  Face  Opie  It's  Just  That  Your  Example  People  Could  Take  It  As  Insulting  You  Bring  It  Up  Specific  People  That  Work  Yeah  But  That's  How  It  Works  How  They  Have  The  Power  To  Do  Nothing  And 
[02:18:00]  That's  Who  You  Would  Go  To  If  You  Want  Nothing  Done  Yeah  If  Again  We  Are  But  But  Technically  I  Guess  In  The  Corporate  World  They  Have  Some  Kind  Of  You  Know  Title  Yeah  We  Would  Go  To  Them  Knowing  That  They  Wouldn't  Be  Able  To  Do  Anything  So  But  If  We  Had  Our  Real  Issue  What  Do  Do  We  We  March  Down  To  The  Corner  Office  To  The  Big  Wigs  Let  You  That's  How  Shit  Works 
[02:18:30]  Is  This  How  You  Is  I  Was  In  And  E-Rock  Stumbled  In  Eating  A  Pound  Cake  And  He  Was  Going  To  Sit  Down  And  Take  A  Shit  And  Eat  So  He  Wouldn't  Actually  Lose  Anything  Whatever  He  Lose  He  Replenish  Immediately  Duty  Boy  Cake  Eater  Now 
[02:19:00]  Let's  Say  That  E-Rock  Witnessed  This  And  Then  He  Has  A  Dilemma  Because  If  He  Runs  Out  He  Might  Shit  His  Pants  And  He  Can't  Eat  The  Cake  He  Doesn't  Mind  Shitting  His  Pants  But  He  Won't  Be  A  To  Eat  The  Pound  Cake  While  He's  Talking  To  Gary  And  Rob  So  Maybe  He  Doesn't  Want  To  Get  Anything  Done  He  Wants  To  Just  Do  A  Quick  So  He  Runs  To  Gary  And  Rob  And  He  Goes  There  Might  Have  Been  Something  Going  On  With  Jim  And  Sam  And  Then  He  Runs  Back  Into  The  Bathroom  And  Sits  Down 
[02:19:30]  And  Let  Him  Fill  His  Underpants  And  Put  The  Cake  Down  While  We're  Talking  And  Ruin  His  Legacy  As  A  Fat  Person  I  Actually  Love  Your  Example  If  You're  Morally  Weak  Very  Weak  That's  Exactly  What  You  Would  Do  You  Would  Do  That  If  You  Were  Duty  Boy  Cake  Eater  You 
[02:20:00]  Would  Do  The  Bare  Minimum  Which  Is  Going  To  Guys  You  Aren't  Going  To  Take  It  To  To  Next  Level  Right  It's  Just  So  Much  Cake  The  Bare  Minimum  That  Was  What  I  Did  Yes  The  Bare  B  E  A  R  Minimum  What  I  Contributed  Speaking of  Bosses  And  Stuff  Can  You  Tell  Scott  Greenstein  Once  Again  There  Is  Pee  On  All  The  Fucking  Toilet  Seats  No  I  Can't  Because  He  Would  Be  Insulted  If  I  Told  Him  That  Just  Tell  Him  That  We  Need  The  Pee 
[02:20:30]  Lick it  What  I  Walked  In  There  And  There  Was  A  Piece  Of  Bacon  On  The  Floor  It's  Just  Duty  Boy  Cake  Eater  Was  Having  Some  Bacon  Pound  Cake  Which  Is  Pound  Cake  With  Bacon  Tape  To  It  What  Type  Of  Animals  Work  At  This  Place  After  We're  Gone  At  Night  Who  The  Fuck  Pees  On  Toilet  Seats  At  Their  Job  The  Weekend  People  Are  Really  Bad  They're  Animals  Right  Can  Tell  Greenstein  That  The  Toilet  Seats  Need  To  Be 
[02:21:00]  Scrubbed  He's  Not  The  Guy  He's  Too  Far  Up  The  Food  Chain  I  Think  At  At  Least  There's  No  Booger  Wall  Like  Our  Old  Place  I  Remember  The  Booger  Wall  I  Miss  The  Boogie  Wall  Too  Don't  You  You  Do  Rollins  Got  A box  Set  In  His  Hand  What  Is  It  It's  Just  Another  Boardwalk  Empire  Oh  We  My dad  Held  That  Same  Job  At  A  Different  College  The  Schultz  Job  Jimmy 
[02:21:30]  Yes  They  Have  Nothing  To  Do  With  The  Police  Department  Besides  Writing  A  Check  Yeah  That  Was  A  Bullshit  That  Was  A  Bullshit  I  Think  I  Covered  My  Bases  By  Doing  This  Three  Guys  Who  Meet  In  The  Fucking  Room  And  Go  What  Are  We  Going  To  Do  About  This  Yeah  How  Are  We  Save  The  University  Period  If Joe  Pa  Really  Went  To  The  Police  Went  To  A  Cop  And  Said  What  The  Fuck  Is  Going  On  Or  Whatever  He  Would  Say  Then  They  Never  Would  Have  Fired  Him  They  The  University  Wanted  To  Paint  Him  As  A  Guy  Who  Did  The  Right  Thing 
[02:22:00]  Let's  Go to  Greg  In  Jersey  Greg  Yeah  Yeah  Look  Guys  Hi  Greg  Hello  Jimmy  Yes  Hello  If Joe  Paterno  Shot  Sandusky  In the  Face  With  A  Nine  Millimeter  Bullet  Nice  You'd  Be  Bitching  He  Didn't  Use  A  45  Okay  No  I  Wouldn't  That  Is  The  Stupid  Terrible  Example  Ever  That  Is  The  Dumbest  Hold  On  We're  Gonna  Make sure  Everyone  Knows  How  Dumb  Your  Example  The  Nine  Probably  Would  Have  Killed  Him  Anyway  By  The  Way  Let  Let  Use  Your  Example  Let's  Say  Joe  Paterno 
[02:22:30]  Did  Shoot  Sandusky  In  The  Face  And  McQuarrie  He  Didn't  Go  To  Schultz  You  Know  What  I  Mean  No  I  Wouldn't  Be  No  Matter  What  Paterno  Did  Wrong  You  You  You  You  Would  Bitch  And  Complain  You  You  Didn't  Get  The  Outcome  That  You  Like  You're  100%  Wrong  And  I'll  Tell you  Why  Sexy  Bit  Example  He's  Giving  Yeah  Iraq  Can  Do  No  Right  Dude  No  I  Don't  Have  An  Agenda  Against 
[02:23:00]  Paterno  I  Have  No  Interest  Yeah  I  Was  Never  In  Paterno  Having  Done  The  Wrong  Thing  And  I  Think  The  University  Had  No  Interest  In  That  The  Best  Case  Scenario  For  Them  Was  That  Fucking  Sandusky  Was  A  Piece  Of  Shit  And  The  Police  Dropped  The  Ball  Like  That  Was  The  Best  Scenario  For  Them  And  I  Have  Nothing  Against  Paterno  What  The  Fuck  Do  I  Care  I  I'm  Reacting  To  What  He  Didn't  Do  It  Sounds  Like  You  Have  A  Personal  Vendetta  Against  Paterno  Because  He  Himself  Didn't  March  In  With  Handcuffs  No  And  Arrest 
[02:23:30]  Sandusky  Not  At  All  Bro  Not  At  All  And  I'm  Not  Trying  To  Paint  It  That  Way  I  Have  No  Vendetta  Against  Him  I'm  Making  Fun  Of  Him  And  My  Kind  Of  Vendictiveness  With  It  Is  To  The  Babies  Who  Are  Offended  By  Me  Mocking  This  Guy  He  Didn't  Do  Enough  And  You  Know  He  Didn't  Do  Enough  I  Wouldn't  Kill  Him  If  He  Went  To  A  Patrolman  And  Not  A  Captain  That's  Not  What  This  Is  About  Because  That's  Just  Going  To  A  Police  Officer  That's  Doing  The  Right  Thing  But  We  All  Know 
[02:24:00]  What  He  Did  Here  And  Can  I  Also  Reiterate  Something  That  Everybody  Seems  To  Campus  Instead  Of  The  Police  Department  Whatever  But  Months  Later  Months  Later  When  You  See  The  Kid  Fucker  Still  Walking  Around  And  Then  Do  Nothing  You  Don't  Go  Back  And  Say  Why  Is  He  Still  Here 
[02:24:30]  What  How  Do  He  Didn't  Do  That  Anthony  How  Do  You  Because  There  Has  Been  No  Fucking  Testimony  From  Anybody  That  He  Had  Gone  Back  Repeatedly  To  Try  To  Get  Sandusky  Thrown  Off  The  Out  To  Make  Him  Look  A  Lot  Better  Than  Than  He's  Looking  Now  He's  Dead  Now  He  Probably  Looks  Awful  Yeah  I  Think  Penn State  Had  To  Fire  Him  Like  The  Guy  Said  To  Try  To  Save  Faith  No  To  Me  That  Hurt  Them  Bro  That  Really  Hurt  Them  Saving  Faze  Again 
[02:25:00]  Schultz  And  Curly  Those  Guys  Are  Fucking  Bums  McQuarrie  A  Bit  Of  A  Bum  Not  Quite  As  Much  Paterno  That's  A  Little  Double  Standard  You  Got  There  Jimmy  No  I  Don't  Okay  I'll  Tell  You  Why  It's  Not  A  Double  Standard  McQuarrie  One  More  Better  I  Don't  Think  Is  As  Bad  Simply  Because  I  Think  He's  Genuinely  A  Guy  Who  Was  Reporting  A  Superior  To  A  Legendary  Superior  No  Why  Is  Legendary 
[02:25:30]  And  It's  Important  Now  I'm  Talking  Hold on  I'm  Not  Talking  About  My  Perception  I'm  Talking  About  The  Fear  McQuarrie  Had  Okay  I'm  Talking  About  Him  Being  Afraid  I'm  Not  Saying  28  Year  Old  Man  You  Know  He  Should  Have  Gone  To  The  Cops  How  Old  Do  You  Like  Anyone  Else  How  Old  Are  28  So  Are  You  Afraid  Of  Your  Boss  At  All  You  Are  Not  Especially  Not  Especially  Not  If  I  See  Some  Guy  Fucking  But  Should  He  Have  Gone  To  Cops  Absolutely  Yes  He  Should  Have 
[02:26:00]  So  Why  Is  He  Not  As  Bad  As  Paterno  Why  Is  He  Getting  A  Little  Of  A  Pass  He's  Not  Getting  A  Pass  But  I'm  Not  Killing  Him  As  Hard  As  Paterno  Because  He's  The  One  First  Of  All  Who  Did  Say  Something  And  Unfortunately  He  Probably  Thought  It  Would  Be  Handled  Properly  Paterno  Wasn't  Joe  Paterno  Hold on  I'm  Telling  You  Not  Afraid  Of  Losing  Job  McQuarrie  Is  The  Guy  Who 
[02:26:30]  Had  A  Lot  To  Lose  And  Again  You  Know  What  That  Does  Kind  Of  Make  A  Scumbag  For  Not  Reporting  So  What  Was  Paterno  Afraid  Of  The  University  Taking  A  Black  Eye  The  Football  Program  Having  A  Black  Eye  Taking  A  Black  Eye  You  No  No  Black  Eye  Oh  See  Fuck  I  So  Okay  So  The  McQuarrie  Two  Piece  Shit  Two  Okay  Fair  Enough  There's  A  Whole  List  Of  Pieces  Of  Shit  But  By  The  Fact  Is  We're  Only  Talking  About  This  Today  Again  Because  He  Died  Over  The  We're  Trying  To  Bail  Paterno

[02:36:30]  confirm you have a cardboard it was confirming what i knew anything worse than super fans you  just called up and lied through your fucking teeth i you don't even have your factory and i  think you guys are as irresponsible as the media i just i should i i'm reading testimony i'm reading  how is jimmy irresponsible when he's reading transcripts yeah that you can look up yourself  i can look it up i'm glad that the attorney that i uh you dummy can't touch a supporter 
[02:37:00]  you you i love you jimmy support pedestal that'll get you far in life then don't call up and say  something like oh mcquery only said that he saw some uh horseplay horsing around so that's why but  you just gave fucking paterno and out and now i'm reading you testimony that tells you the exact  opposite and you just keep talking instead of going oh i didn't know that that one statement  shows her denial big time yes because everyone knows what horsing around means an 80 year old man 
[02:37:30]  thinking the same as you pervert yeah no he doesn't know what a fucking what what something he the 80  year old man testified i'll say it again i don't know what you would call it but it was of a sexual  nature so you explain to me how that gets lost in translation with age how is she calling us  perverts as we completely support the kids in this one you dope i don't give a no answer again  go fuck yeah chicks are weirdos your chicks are weirdos if it wasn't for that fucking vagina man 
[02:38:00]  you'd be terrible debaters put a strap put a strap on your joe pa cut out and have fun tonight  so many girls if it wasn't for what weirdo if it wasn't for what you wouldn't have the money it  wouldn't you wouldn't have so many girls exactly i had a lot of girls when i was broke dummy that was  for me she's right when i was fucking broke i wouldn't because i'm funny and i have a giant  cock how big is it so fuck you in your fucking ass i'm uh i'm with an on this one i always got a  cracker you calling thank you my friend i always i always got good looking girls oh no no i'm 
[02:38:30]  thinking i'm trying to eat nutty carbs  i'm a sweater boy cutie go ahead miss camera go ahead oh one more thing she hung up no she actually  got us all right but you're right women do debate like like whatever that's not what i agree with so  i'll just go well whatever you say but then in that moment that is why men kill their wives 
[02:39:00]  right it was like instead of just going oh okay you're there fact fact fact fact testimony legal  testimony oh you don't have your facts what the fuck was i just blurting out but i knew that he  didn't or i didn't believe he went to the cops and then this lawyer calls up and he sounds convincing  so i'm telling sam google did he go to the cut like i'm looking for it like hey man am i wrong  and then i'm fucking going over the gary schultz thing what exactly is his position is that going to  the cops and then after having analyzed what a position i don't think he did they don't want 
[02:39:30]  to hear it holy i was very willing to admit i was wrong there the penn state people are going to  have to you know realize eventually that the legacy is it's a little tarnished it's fucked yeah  yeah we're not even close to the end of this whole scandal i don't think not even close your legacy is  fucked i don't believe he's a pedophile and that's unfortunate  and that's unfortunate but those are the facts i don't like the idea that people think i got  pussy just because of money i get good pussy because of money yeah i got plenty of mediocre to 
[02:40:00]  lower range pussy believe me i always get good pussy oh just for the record all right for all being  honest we should break you fucking assholes uh yeah sounds good to me all right there's your  joe pa shit wow that got heated yeah but i mean it's uh they they because they i have no feelings 
[02:40:30]  about joe paterno before this i didn't give a fuck about joe paterno i'm not like some rival fan who  always hated him right so when someone she said i have like a or someone said i have like a  a vendetta yeah of course i don't i was uh what do i care i was more than aware of his importance in  uh football and to penn state and his legacy and as soon as this came out my without a doubt i'm like  oh boy that fucks that up that's simple as that before i even dug in i'm like oh boy that's not good 
[02:41:00]  for his legacy and how important he was to the football program in the university oh boy is he  going to be tarnished there was no doubt in my mind can't have one of the people that are under  you no pun uh fucking kids and not have some responsibility in it especially if they're still  there the next fucking day supposedly up until october i don't know if that fact is true by the way  we do try to stick with the facts yeah but anything longer than the next day right is too fucking long 
[02:41:30]  right oh my god yeah unbelievable people people get fired for the dumbest fucking things yeah that  seems like a pretty legit reason to have canned the guy but right or put him on uh permanent  suspension or something double secret probation whatever the fuck you gotta do i suppose he's in  the president's box up until late october even i just won't understand the other side on this one at  all no it's ridiculous i i'm bewildered i'm bewitched i haven't been bewildered in a while i'm

[02:49:30]  you know yes of course jockeys short fellas and then dave runs up on stage because he lost because  he lost and and just ruins this person's moment but but was it a moment to ruin look how shitty this  looks hey this was a couple of years ago you know how big it's built up to now who doesn't want  they got a shitty banner and a big screen that's it oh it looks huge who was there  wasn't there uh dave falls on the floor because that's what dave does his routine i love when he 
[02:50:00]  yells and falls on the floor and he said fuck you cnn because rick sanchez was the host yes rick  sanchez from cnn was the host and now he's dumping water off his head as he's walking off the stage  he was trying to win the award for weird weird but no one's reacting to it no they're hard they  were there's a bunch of horrified there's only a bunch of fuddy duddies go to the shorty award yes 
[02:50:30]  all right well so you got the tweet out they retweet that so now the tweets out there just to  retweet it and you don't have to go anywhere all you gotta do is look retweet it and it's a vote i  already tweeted by the way i want a shorty award i nominated you for comedian jimmy so so you just  vote for jimmy in the comedian section and uh i see you getting a lot i've never won an award you  know the shorty awards are supposed to be for people who like aren't on the tonight show and

[02:54:00]  look radio category i i don't want that i wasn't in that no i know but i'm glad there's no there's  nobody's in the radio category yeah like i said there's nobody's in the radio category that's why web  show is good because it's like people that are just doing it cares i'm in there you know who are  these radio people and where were where are their shows i don't know is justin bieber in the radio  i'm sure he is i twitter by the way i twittered i won a shorty award then in quotes i wrote what the 
[02:54:30]  fuck is a shorty award and then someone responded it's when you bend over and immediately sticks  sarm up your anus now that's something to go for yeah i'll say that's a tally award  oh stop you're 35th in uh radio i guess so not not sam sam you have 18 radio shows  should be higher you should be number one yeah why don't you guys vote for me for radio since  opie and anthony refused to vote for him in radio i don't want a radio award i'll take the radio 
[02:55:00]  one you take it because you're newer to the business we did that already we got radio awards  vote for me in radio because otherwise do you really want covino and rich to be up there  they're on there they're on there oh i didn't know that i wouldn't say what i said if i do that sam  i also want to be able to say the award winning live from the compound the award winning would be  a huge uh you know that's a cool just give yourself an award and then you could say that i could do that  save save yourself the trouble hey um warren buffett he's crazy i didn't i didn't forget he's pretty 
[02:55:30]  much the the the richest man in the world or the second richest he's right up there always right  yeah well um the chinese are doing their uh their uh new year they can't they can't celebrate like  the rest of us they have to do it in the middle of nowhere yeah why is that because for them it's  like 5 000 yeah they got like these weird uh rules as far as their years go and i like how  they were promoting it on tv is it 5 000 i don't know it's a lot they were saying it's one of the 
[02:56:00]  most watched ceremonies uh in the world and it's like anything that happens in china would be the  most watched first of all they make you watch shit right how many channels could there be in china  and they got over a billion of the motherfuckers you better hope they don't get aware of the shorty  awards oh shit trouble a shorty award go to everyone in country because they're all short  that's great it's gonna take a slight second but that's really funny 
[02:56:30]  uh so warren buffett i guess he likes the chinese i guess he does a lot of business with them i would  i would assume yeah so he uh look at his little train set that's kind of cool right yeah he's got a  a little uh uh miniature train set he you're gonna love him after you hear what song he  yeah now decided to sing to the chinese people what's the problem with this what is that i think  you should play it and then let people decide why would this be kind of a problem i uh can i say now 
[02:57:00]  or okay so can get it so he decided to uh as part of the chinese new year celebration he would play  this for the people of uh china yeah i've been working on the railroad to the chinese i guess  because for martin luther king's birthday he sang wade in the water yes um strange fruit jump down 
[02:57:30]  turn around pick a barrel of cotton what the fuck is this guy thinking i don't know i don't think  the chinese really enjoyed building our railroad system i don't think it was the best of working  conditions i don't think it was on the best of terms no no i don't think it's pretty much slave  labor i don't think there were a lot of volunteers was this for chinese new year though yeah that's  what they're saying on the news oh yeah it is okay all right hit it 
[02:58:00]  i've been working on the railroad  quite literally hours stunk  just to pass the time away  can't you hear the whistle blow  rise up so early in the morning  i hope them  wang blow your horn  he sings that fucking i've been working on the railroad could be the most offensive song to sing to chinese people 
[02:58:30]  you think yeah i don't know why there's one that's worse  i don't think so  turning japanese would be worse 
[02:59:00]  yes  maybe for japanese people  well no chinese if you're singing it to the chinese people  oh  they'd be offended  how about my little china girl  oh baby just you shut your mouth  did you say bowie  yeah  what  oh no  oh you're not going to i didn't think you were going to  holy shit  is this the big debut  oh  did you say bowie  yeah  i didn't think you were going to  i've been waiting for a natural segway  yes  we all know
