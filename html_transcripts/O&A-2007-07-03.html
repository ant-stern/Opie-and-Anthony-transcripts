<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a bizarre "boiled meat barbecue" for the Fourth of July.  The hosts and several staff members, including Danny (who was noticeably hungover), participated in a grotesque eating challenge featuring a variety of unusual and offal meats.  This included ox penis, sheep testicles (described as resembling tumors), sheep stomach lining (tripe), beef tendon balls, a "gooey duck" (a clam with a large appendage), boneless duck feet, beef tongue, pig's head, sea cucumbers, and sheep liver.  The segment was filled with gagging, spitting, and vomiting, and the strong odor prompted the use of Lysol.  Patrice O'Neill and Pat from Minaki (a competitive hot dog eater) were studio guests who also partook in the culinary ordeal, which culminated in a sea cucumber chewing contest focusing on endurance.  The intern's video, “Big Boy Makes a Duty,” showing him retrieving and handling fecal matter with his bare hands for $300, was also shown.

The show continued with a discussion about a local news anchor, Jill Nicolini, focusing on her appearance and speculating about her career.  Listeners called in for "Rock Scream Tuesday" segments.  Further discussion revolved around a video called "Big Boy Makes a Duty" (featuring an intern retrieving and handling feces) and "Baby Bird" (an eggnog drinking contest ending in vomiting), both shown to and reviewed by guest Kevin Smith, who was also present to promote his appearance at a movie premiere and to discuss an earlier confrontation with the deceased film critic Joel Siegel.  Kevin Smith also commented on a poorly photoshopped publicity image of Opie and Anthony.

Patrice O’Neill, along with Jared and Eric (from the staff), further participated in the boiled meat segment, attempting to eat ox penis, with Jared vomiting afterward.  The group also consumed a pig's face.  A call from Dale, a New Jersey native teaching English in South Korea, discussed the time difference and his proximity to the DMZ.  Jimmy was another guest, contributing to a detailed discussion of the movie "Vice Squad," highlighting favorite scenes and actors.  The hosts also extensively discussed Patrice O'Neal’s experiences with prostitutes in Brazil, detailing the interactions, money involved, and his emotional responses, comparing them to experiences with sex workers in the US. The discussion extended to a broader conversation about the dynamics of paid sex and the relative respect he felt in Brazil compared to the United States, further touching upon the perceived transactional nature of sex work in America versus the more respectful and extended interactions in Rio, and his personal preference for younger women in Brazil as he aged.  The show also mentioned an upcoming appearance on Black Philip, a listener being banned from the show, listener lines about "pickled Doug foot," and an upcoming "teen voyeur bus" show.  The broadcast concluded with promotions for upcoming shows and farewells.

[00:02:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:00]  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Next week, we hit Philly.  Yes.  One of our favorite cities. 
[00:03:30]  The city of brotherly love, they call it.  Philadelphia.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, it's like the most vicious collection of creatures.  I got to get something off my chest.  So I'm going through my morning routine, reading the papers, drinking coffee, whatever.  And then I got hit the bathroom.  And all of a sudden, I see like Danny stumbling around with no shoes on.  I think he just woke up. 
[00:04:00]  I think he was sleeping on that couch.  What the F is going on with this F in radio show?  What happened last night?  What happened last night?  And then I try to get an answer from Danny and he won't even talk to me.  And then he stumbles out of here with his shoes and socks.  There he is.  Look at this kid.  What is going on?  How you doing, Danny?  I'm good.  What happened last night?  And why wouldn't you answer me?  Nothing.  We were hanging out. 
[00:04:30]  It was Monday karaoke night.  Now it's a Monday karaoke night?  Yeah, with a live band.  Down at, what the hell's the name of that joint?  Arlene's Grocery.  Arlene's Grocery.  Yeah?  And you slept here last night?  A little bit.  I wouldn't quite call it sleeping.  What did you do?  I kind of just laid for a few minutes.  Cool.  Why couldn't you sleep?  It was late.  What did you sing in karaoke? 
[00:05:00]  What did I do?  I did War Pigs.  Oh, boy.  Yes, you did War Pigs.  Oh, man.  You had a few more beers and shots.  Than you?  Yeah, I didn't have any shots.  I had a few beers, but I kept looking at my watch and going, you know, I got to go.  Yeah, it's getting a little late.  I got a room, so I'm just going to go and crash. 
[00:05:30]  And Danny was like, ah, just drop me off.  Yeah, I came back here and laid down.  This show sucks, man.  This show is a disaster.  Just falling apart at the seams.  It was the pre-4th of July pre-pre-party.  Well, traditional on July 2nd to drink karaoke and drink alcoholically, which will kind of, 
[00:06:00]  the vomiting takes you, like, bridges the third into the glory of the fourth.  We celebrate our independence.  All I saw was Danny walking around with no shoes or socks.  I'm like, yeah, that's the way to show up for work.  But then I found out it's something a little different, I guess.  How's things at home?  They're good.  Okay.  As good as they've always been, huh?  Are you still hammered?  No, no, no, I'm fine.  You're totally sober, right? 
[00:06:30]  I'm sorry?  You're sober.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Nice to lay on the answer.  Jesus.  I'm just very tired right now.  Excuse me, why?  That was fun, though.  Yeah, it was fun.  It was a good time.  Yeah?  Absolutely.  So what do we got today?  What's going on here today?  I smell like, I smell a hot plate or something. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  What are we cooking today?  Boiled meat barbecue.  Right.  Yeah.  He was sleeping on the couch shirtless.  I'm getting communicated.  Oh, so gross.  Was Danny nude?  Ew.  He was nude.  His cheeks are hairy.  You're welcome.  Stupid teen wolf.  With his hands between his legs, just touching his junk.  Because it couldn't be warm in here at night.  No.  Are you eating some of this meat today?  Do I have to?  Oh, boy. 
[00:07:30]  Do you?  Do you?  Yeah.  Will you?  I think.  I think it should be tasty.  Gooey duck sounds great.  The name just sounds delicious.  A little gooey duck.  Yeah.  So, what do we got?  We got the boiled meat barbecue for 4th of July.  We want a real barbecue, but we can't have a...  No open flame.  Yeah.  No open flame here in the studio.  So, we said, what the hell?  Why don't we boil some just awful meats today and have some of the boys try it out?  No spices. 
[00:08:00]  What could be the difference?  Nothing.  What could be the difference?  No condiments.  You get a nice boiled piece of London broil, maybe, or boiled chicken.  It's got to be just as good as barbecued.  Nothing tastes good boiled except for maybe potatoes.  Yeah.  That is about it.  Yeah.  Ask the Irish.  Boil meat.  It just turns into this gray mess.  Danny, we're kind of done.  You can do whatever you're doing.  They're just standing there awkwardly.  What are you doing, Dan, before I'm called you in? 
[00:08:30]  Sleeping.  But I mean to work, what are you doing?  What?  Like, what are you doing at home?  People, whatever.  Back in the office, I'm saying.  What are you doing?  I'm going through the normal routine of prepping.  Okay.  I don't know.  I'm never here.  What is prepping?  I come in at a quarter of.  So, like, what does that entail?  That's going through all the sites, trying to find stuff and audio and junk. 
[00:09:00]  What did you find so far?  Anything good?  No, it says very slow there.  Sam?  You're Travis.  What?  He's laughing.  He's giggling like a girl.  Oh.  Hey.  He's giggling like Travis.  Man.  So, I...  All right.  Slow day.  Slow day.  Slow day.  I'm sure Preston and Steve and Philly are having a slow day, and they just wander around 
[00:09:30]  hungover all morning.  It was fun.  Got a little out of hand.  A little bit.  Yeah.  And they wouldn't call Danny up early enough in the set.  Kept just passing by.  Getting these broads up there singing.  And then finally it was Danny's turn, and then we left.  But my goodness.  What time did he just leave?  It took a long time. 
[00:10:00]  Well, that had to be...  7.30 p.m.  That had...  I got back to the room at about 2.  About 2.  Ordered something to eat, which I ate half of and promptly fell asleep and the rest of.  That woke me up, though.  Then I had dessert.  At 2, you were singing?  I was...  My girlfriend's furious at me because at 12.30, I hate when I'm really tired and I get  into bed and I just know that she's got things on her mind because she's like all freshly 
[00:10:30]  showered and looking...  And I'm like, ugh.  Oh.  Don't get your hopes up.  I'm tired.  And she starts snuggling up.  Uh-oh.  And the pants come off and we're just laying and talking.  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.  Did you?  I am such an old man.  She's laying on my chest and I know she's horny.  And I caught myself apnea waking up.  I was like, ugh.  Oh, no.  Apnea dozed.  I slept on my back and I kept apologizing. 
[00:11:00]  Don't mind me.  I'm going to just stop breathing a few times during the night.  There's nothing a woman wants to hear less when she's ready for sex than...  You know, her boyfriend almost dying from lack of air intake.  All right.  We'll plow through this.  Thanks, Danny.  You're welcome.  Dan, are you going to go up and grab some audio?  Yes.  Oh. 
[00:11:30]  Go to it, Danny.  Danny's a trooper.  He'll pull through.  Oh, he's got some laughs out of...  Oh.  Oh, is that one of those?  All right.  Is that duck goo?  Gooey duck.  Look at the size of that thing.  I've got a new respect for the gooey duck.  Oh, God.  I've seen that gooey duck in some movies.  It's white that big.  That tip's a little discolored. 
[00:12:00]  Wonderful.  What is that?  Ox penis.  What is it?  Ox.  Ox penis.  Is that one or two?  I think it's one.  Why would you serve that as food?  Like, who...  Yeah, who eats that?  Oof.  There's plenty of parts of an ox that you can eat before you get down to that.  That should come after the hooves.  You better be really hungry to have to go, all right, cook it.  Well, that's being boiled.  I'm sure that'll bring out its natural flavors. 
[00:12:30]  All right, yeah.  So what else we got over there?  We have sheep testicles.  Pre-sliced.  Yes.  Nice.  Looks like there's eight of them.  Wow.  Eight sheep testes.  How much are they charging a pound for that?  What is that?  Uh, this was $3.99 a pound.  That's not a lot of money.  The gooey duct was $37.  I'm talking about for the testicle.  What the hell is...  $17 a pound.  Why?  No. 
[00:13:00]  Are they rare?  This is disgusting.  What is that?  Comes with an iPhone?  And...  Boneless duck feet?  Wow, that is...  That looks like potatoes.  Let me see that.  Ugh!  Who the hell eats this?  And how they get the bones out of their little feet.  And how they get the covering, like...  Like...  Duck feet are...  The duck will fall down.  Yes, with its little flappy feet.  He's laying all stupid.  You're trying to throw bread at it. 
[00:13:30]  Can't move.  Just collapse on a sidewalk.  Let me take a look at the duck feet there.  That, um...  Ugh!  It's the flippers.  They're like the...  That skin between their disgusting little duck toes.  These are beef tendon balls.  Um...  What is...  I don't know what they are.  I don't think they're testes.  No.  But they're tendons that have been ground up and rolled into meatballs.  Oh, there you go. 
[00:14:00]  What is that?  A duck bill?  Is that a duck head?  What is that?  Smoked beef tongue.  That is the tongue of a cow ripped out of its head from the root.  It certainly is.  And, uh...  These are sea cucumbers.  That looks like liver.  Yeah.  There's like...  There's a pound of them in here, so...  There is a real, like, meat...  Holocaust going on in this country...  In this world.  Ew!  It's a whole pig head. 
[00:14:30]  Yep.  Wow.  An entire pig's head.  We're gonna boil that today?  What, did Danny bring it back last night at our karaoke?  Ugh!  That's gotta be tasty.  Just boiling a pig's head and then plucking the meat off of it and shoving it in your mouth.  Dude, I don't...  This is awful.  Because there's...  What's that, Steve?  That's tripe.  That's a stomach of cow?  Is that what that is? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, something like that.  A cow stomach.  Because unless this stuff is prepared with, like, different sauces and cooked the right  way, it really must just taste like crap.  But there is somebody that would look at all these foods and go, yes, I like that.  I like that.  I've eaten that.  A starving Somali.  I can't picture anyone in this country eating this stuff.  What is that?  This is beef liver.  And these are pig's feet.  Ah.  Delicacy.  Pig's feet.  Quite the delicacy. 
[00:15:30]  So what is...  All right.  What are we starting off...  What time are we going to start eating?  Well, they're boiling the water right now.  What's the contest?  What do they win?  Nothing.  Oh.  They just have to do it.  Just like...  It's our boy.  ...the duty hat wearer.  Duty boy.  I saw duty hat, and I got to tell you, it's a hit.  I mean, it was well acted, well directed.  Yeah, I watched the video, and...  Well, you got to explain, this side of the show did not... 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  ...has no idea what you're talking about.  Of course not.  Jimmy left a treat in the toilet yesterday.  Just a treat.  That's what he calls it.  I called it one of the most disgusting messes I've ever seen.  And, well, one of the interns volunteered to follow our direction, and be part of a little  motion picture that's been made, and is now up on the internet, for your viewing pleasure. 
[00:16:30]  He actually put his hand in that very toilet, and lifted up what looked like, well, it felt  like, he said the texture was like pudding and corn in his hand, bare hand, non-gloved,  mind you.  Right.  And he picked it up, delivered his lines, there were lines in this, it was rehearsed many times,  put a duty hat on, that looked like one of those little sailor hats you make out of a 
[00:17:00]  newspaper, and then he put one on the pile that was in his hand.  The gift.  The gift.  And then said, bye-bye, and flushed it down the toilet, leaving just disgusting residue  on his hand.  I don't know why you did it.  You didn't do it.  What was it, $300, maybe?  $300?  Yeah.  And the glory?  And the glory. 
[00:17:30]  Well, the glory.  Well, the video's up on the old website.  Wasn't that bad, right?  No, it wasn't that bad.  Does your hand at all smell like it shouldn't?  Oh, no.  Shouldn't?  No.  It's good now?  Yeah, I've been washing my hands with Purell and pretty much everything.  Under your fingernails?  Yeah.  Can you give it a good, and nothing?  Nothing.  They use weird music with it.  Like, I was hoping for, I like the music they use.  Laurel and Hardy, not sound right?  No.  Oh, the director, producer, sound engineer. 
[00:18:00]  I found some website that just had a ton of Laurel and Hardy songs, but didn't have  the exact one we were playing yesterday, but that was definitely the best one.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I like the one you decided on.  Is there a way to hear a moment of the song?  There's no cursing.  Eric stopped.  Hope not.  No.  He rocks panicking.  Oh, my God. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, Jimmy, what happened in there?  Big boy made a doody.  Did someone say big boy made a doody?  I'm lacking.  And there he goes.  Big boy sure did make a doody.  Bye-bye. 
[00:19:00]  Bye-bye.  He said bye-bye twice.  And waved goodbye.  I think he knew the camera didn't cast you.  He was going to wave.  Yeah.  He was improvising.  Nice.  Well, now you've got to see the video.  It's up on our website.  All right.  We're off to a great start.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's our boiled meat barbecue for 4th of July.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  It's Hummer Tuesday.  And it's Far Away Phone Call Tuesday.  Far Away.  Well, that's already this a week.  A week has gone by since Far Away Phone Call. 
[00:19:30]  Wow.  You're forgetting something.  Flies.  What?  It's cat voice testing.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  It never will be.  Wasn't that Wednesday anyway?  No.  It's Thursday.  No, it's Tuesday.  No, it wasn't.  All right.  We'll be back.  It's O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:20:00]  All right.  Let's try this again.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The virus spreading across America the day before 4th of July.  Getting ready for our boiled meat barbecue.  Ah, some traditions may just stand the test of time.  Boiled meat barbecue is one of them. 
[00:20:30]  First year we're doing this, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got gooey duck, which is like a clam with a massive, massive appendage that sticks out  of the damn thing.  We got sheep testicles, ox penis, boneless duck feet.  Well, you don't want boned ones.  No.  Disgusting.  Beef tendon balls, sea cucumbers, beef tongue, tripe, which is downright disgusting.  I don't know what the other stuff tastes like, but tripe is just god-awful. 
[00:21:00]  Then a pig's head.  And the pig's head still has the teeth.  Oh, it's a big, whole pig's head.  It's been cut off.  It's the whole head.  I had tripe years ago in some kind of a spicy soup thing, and it wasn't bad.  It was cut up real small.  It was in some kind of spicy Mexican soup, so it wasn't bad.  But boiled, horrific. 
[00:21:30]  All this stuff boiled is going to be horrific.  Yeah, because there's only going to be rancid, like, taste with this horrid boiled texture.  Not fun.  T-bone steak boiled is disgusting.  Yeah, yeah.  Anything, no matter how delicious.  Yeah, take filet mignon.  Yeah, there's going to be no spices, no condiments.  What are we dropping into the pot first?  Have we decided?  And the funny thing is, we get cooks in here all the time, and they can't wait to get their plugs out.  Today, I've been informed, no plugs whatsoever. 
[00:22:00]  They don't want to.  No plugs.  They don't want to be associated with this officially.  They just want to do their job and get the hell out.  Yeah.  So what are we dropping in first?  I think we're going to do the...  Should we get someone over there with a microphone, please?  Well, maybe.  The ox...  Ox...  Penis.  Penis is going to be the first one to go to the drink.  Which is a delicacy...  Where?  No place around here that I know of. 
[00:22:30]  Then I think we're going to, right after that, we're going to do the boneless duck feet.  How would you normally prepare boneless duck feet?  I would never normally prepare boneless duck feet.  So boiling it to you is fine?  Yeah.  We're going to boil it.  We're going to make sure it's cooked.  How do you know it's cooked?  You cut it in half, and what are you looking for?  You're looking for the protein to be firm, and that the temperature is where it needs to be.  Ew.  What does firm protein look like? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Check your sheets.  It's kind of one of those things that's hard to actually explain.  I'd have to show it to you.  Okay.  What's the most disgusting thing there, would you say?  Well, there's quite a few disgusting things.  I would say that the boiled beef liver is pretty disgusting.  Yeah.  Liver's consistency is very, like, mushy.  Yeah, and it's good to sear quickly, but just boiling it in plain old water is not doing anything for that. 
[00:23:30]  And I'm going to say that these sheep's testicles are probably going to be rather disgusting as well.  Hard to get down, I would think.  All right.  Well, drop something into the pot live on the air here.  What do you got?  Is the water about ready?  Yeah, we're good to go.  All right.  We're good to go.  Ah, yeah.  Here it is.  He's got two pots there, one big cauldron-like pot, and then kind of a long trough-looking pot.  He's opened up the trough one, a couple of burners underneath it. 
[00:24:00]  He's going with the ox penis right now, which is rolled up like a cinnamon bun.  I'm sure it's not as...  It's like Cinnabon.  I'm sure it'll smell the same.  That's an extra-sized cinnamon.  Must have been a very confident ox.  Yes.  He sure strode around the farm.  Look at me.  You don't have to throw the whole thing in there.  He's throwing the whole thing in there like we can't wait to get second.  Like people are going to want more.  Hey, where's the ox penis? 
[00:24:30]  Who ate all the ox penis?  How long will that deliciousness take to boil, mister?  I'm going to say that that's going to take about 40 minutes.  40 minutes?  That long?  We're not going to eat anything today.  Do we have anything that's going to boil faster?  Yeah, we'll get something in there that's going to go quick.  Ah, okay.  All right, what are you throwing in that's going to be quick?  That's going to be like the tasty treat.  These duck feet are going to go real quick.  Yeah, they look pretty small.  What do they feel like without the bones?  Oh, look.  They're like...  They kind of look like mushrooms.  Mushrooms are raviolis. 
[00:25:00]  They're white like raviolis.  Yeah.  You know that hard, like almost exoskeleton that's on a duck's foot?  Has that been removed?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, it's, uh...  Who knew there was meat in a duck's foot?  That is disgusting.  I don't know what it is.  And the webbing is...  It doesn't look like...  Wait, they took the bones out, but they kept the webbing?  Well, the webbing's the best part, Opie.  Ugh.  That is really heinous.  All this food gives me the creeps.  It is so disgusting that it's packaged, and people buy this and eat it. 
[00:25:30]  Take your duck foot back with you.  He's photographing it.  How long do you expect the duck feet to take?  Duck feet should only be a few minutes.  Oh, yeah.  Duck feet, that's cool.  Whenever I order it, it's right out.  Yeah, it's a little...  Comes right out.  I think those are going to be creepy to eat because of the consistency, and because you realize  you're eating a foot.  A duck's foot.  It looks like a foot.  I want someone to take a bite out of the webbing. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, the webbing.  Just gnaw on the webbing.  Nong, nong, nong, nong, nong, nong, nong, nong, nong.  Looks rubbery, too.  Yeah, well, how long is the duck feet going to take?  I'm going to say about 12 minutes.  Yeah.  You don't want to cook it more than that.  It ruins it.  That will ruin it.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  So we'll wait for the duck feet to boil.  The ox penis is boiling, but that's going to take about 40 minutes.  What do you got there, Jimmy?  I'm just reading.  It says the Goldman family acquires rights to cancel OJ's book. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, did they get screwed on that deal?  Oh, yeah, because it wasn't going to be sold now.  Yeah.  Who's going to buy it when it's available online?  And there's no way that they're going to have the same view on it that OJ did.  They're probably going to...  Change things.  You're thinking it's going to be a re-edit?  Yeah.  Why I did it.  Well, yeah, they actually...  I'm pretty sure this is part of the story that they said they're going to change the title  to Confessions of a Double Murderer. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, there you go.  That's...  And we're going to remove Charlie, because there was no Charlie.  Didn't have the same pizzazz as if I did it.  If I did it.  Confessions of a Double Murderer is just kind of, you know, bland.  Are they going to make a couple hundred bucks out of this book now?  I don't know.  I'd buy it just to have it, have a copy laying around the house.  Imagine someone just, like, changes the title of your book like that.  Yeah, that'd be awful.  That'd be horrible.  Poor O.J.  They don't buy the rights to my book. 
[00:27:30]  They'll call it Why I'm an Anchorage slash Third Wheel.  Why I'm a Show Wrecker.  Anchorage?  I know.  What are you...  I know.  Why I'm a city in Alaska.  I know.  I was trying to say anchor and then something after it, and I effed up.  Why I'm a gnome.  Exactly.  People have been telling me I'm a Juno my entire life.  What an ass.  I forgot.

[00:33:00]  tuesday pat from not coming today because he was here yesterday and then he had delivery to make  he blew us off yesterday i saw the nathan thing on tv and he was supposed to come in and i think he's  supposed to come in today and eat some of this boiled meat for us uh what is that going to hurt his  chances for uh tomorrow big four that's his life is it it's his life it'll empty out his stomach 
[00:33:30]  where are we at there mister man that doesn't want to be plugged  we're coming along nicely yeah yep how those duck feet duck feeder duck feeder they're coming  along nicely i'm gonna have some tripe ready momentarily too oh you threw the tripe in  what's going in right sorry if they're all being boiled in the same pot that's that's gonna cut down  the flavor oh he just dropped the tripe on the floor each one's gonna flavor the other did you drop 
[00:34:00]  one on the floor no one slipped out of the tongs into the into the trash can it can stay there i have  plenty more uh get a good one you know pat actually spends the whole year thinking about  this this is his big event you know people like train for the olympics that's every four years and  then their their time comes how important it is to them that's how pat feels about the hot dog  eating contest the nathan's uh hot dog eating contest in coney island and they want to look at like 
[00:34:30]  competitive eating is some kind of like uh like they're athletes a sport it's not a sport these  people are athletes um sorry our own pat from unaki is far from an athlete who's the who's the  asian dude that wins it every year with the kobayashi i think he's out this year yeah because he had  jaw he strand his jaw big scandal really that's what i'm saying i'm saying and i want to ask pat  about this big shake up in the competitive eating world uh apparently there was some guy 
[00:35:00]  that beat out kobayashi's time he ate a lot more hot dogs than kobayashi did and he's going to be in  the nathan's uh hot dog eating contest and i don't think kobayashi wants to lose his title to this guy  so he's pulling out so if the other guy wins even if he breaks his record he didn't beat kobayashi  so you think that it's kind of he just can't accept one man who's eating hot dogs quickly 
[00:35:30]  can't accept the fact that there's another man who will eat more hot dogs in a quicker amount of  time you kind of don't put the country is just ridiculous you know the way you say it it doesn't  really put the importance on it that i think these people are feeling for their sport  you make it sound stupid and um and uh useless what do you say i have jaw arthritis  that's what he said jaw arthritis if it's never affected a porn girl how can he claim jaw arthritis  it's never shut down a porn shoot well they never have to chew either he's kind of it's true 
[00:36:00]  gotta chew those up a little bit i don't know maybe that's it are the duck feet done there sir  oh we'll get some uh some eating going before the break here  oiled meat barbecue fourth of july i would just say yeah they're done how do you tell  there's no way to tell he doesn't know that milk i can't drink milk man it takes my taste  oh god oh they're done he's saying yes they have uh what what's the consistency of them uh as 
[00:36:30]  compared to a a food that's normally eaten what would you say like a calamar baby so my calamar  i would say it would be similar to the consistency of an overdone calamar overdone calamar  like uh so what you're saying is rubber bands pretty much pretty much yes very rubbery  oh i'd love to ask the um um i don't know group of people that enjoy this type of food uh why they 
[00:37:00]  don't just eat good food i why would you look at a duck's foot and go i have to eat that that is  delectable what does it smell like he rock  hmm it's real  thanks no i don't know will you get your face out of the duck it smells like chicken and dumplings 
[00:37:30]  no chicken and dumplings well or chicken dumplings chicken dumplings yeah is this uh good if you're on  dr ian's uh diet i imagine it would be yeah the duck's feet so who's gonna try the duck foot  danny yeah start danny oh we should start off with danny oh no yes we should danny's indisposed  where's danny oh he's the word evacuation is coming 
[00:38:00]  oh jesus the what he's he's indisposed not it not as in he won't come it's that he's unavailable  what is he doing um is he in the in the is he in the bathroom voiding yes from which uh we don't  know that someone might know it could someone find out ask ask him uh which uh if he can answer 
[00:38:30]  we'll know yeah if he can answer we know what not necessarily  i think we should start off eating uh  a nice tasty duck foot take a nibble in the meantime if that'll  help is danny in the bathroom down the hall yeah  oh if he didn't go into this one yeah there's trouble brewing he would he knows better  oh well i see the big beef tongue is being unwrapped sir will you be slicing that up 
[00:39:00]  for a faster uh cook i certainly will answer ah see thin i know get this thing going yes  slice it nice and thin what's going on i apparently he's not in the bathroom i don't  know where danny is like holy crap cheesesteak like a steakum made out of a tongue  oh there it is oh wow that slice is very why does that make my tongue hurt  he's cutting a tongue because at one time that was used to talk even though it's a stupid cow i 
[00:39:30]  mean they have to have some form of communication what do they do moodily doodily do they just go  meh they could yank it right out and they'd still go meh no i think cows have some sort of a  communication network it'll be affected by the tongue being removed and sliced wow that is uh you  slice that like pepperoni sir you're talented and that's going in the pot of water some nice uh 
[00:40:00]  little circles of cow tongue uh iraq is still holding the duck foot now iraq it's going to get  cold eat your duck foot before it gets cold i didn't mean bite the webbing yeah take it bite in  between its toes where the duck would have toe jam i was admiring the traces of vein in the webbing  oh take a bite out of that oh is there veins in the webbing or what used to be the veins just think 
[00:40:30]  of that little fella made from across the street yeah that was underneath him propelling him in the  little water all right here he goes all right here he goes all right iraq with the uh the duck foot  take a bite  don't you dare waste that duck foot you eat that whole duck foot you took a big bite  oh that face oh jesus what what what does it taste like  his eyes are watering you gotta finish it you ever taste uncooked squid 
[00:41:00]  oh god the consistency must really be awful you can't chew it because it slides in between the  gaps of your teeth i can't get it out from the back of my teeth  bite number two should be helpful yeah that might help you might want to bite another one 
[00:41:30]  that might squeeze the first portion out and bite the other webbing yeah get the webbing  or that's what i did i did the webbing okay get a big toe now bite into its ankle i say he pops the  whole thing in his mouth god is going right in your direction go ahead pop it all in your mouth  well get him a garbage can here yeah garbage pail get the garbage pail close to the subject please  is it cartilage yeah probably what do you think held that little fella up is there something in  there are you squeezing it out it was like a zit oh god oh it's like a zit it's coming out

[00:42:30]  of the duck foot made up for the cartilage that i just swallowed oh yeah that's gonna have a hard  time twisting and turning around your digestive digestive tract how's it taste is it more the  consistency of the taste um i think it's more the consistency because it doesn't feel right  being eaten it's not like food it actually kind of feels like it's still alive when you're eating it  it's like moving who else wants to try the duck foot hey steve i think danny's coming in now oh 
[00:43:00]  where's danny nice i was i was told he was in the area danny iraq is is spitting now he's spitting  into the garbage pail don't waste it danny some fresh duck foot now iraq has tried some he said the  consistency is very nice that's been compared to uh and um try to dig into the webbing first yeah 
[00:43:30]  take a bite of that duck foot son big bite webbing toes oh that does not that does not smell very good  no just remember there's a pail behind you and that's what the duck foot is saying  now it's pickled duck foot a duck duck foot duck foot  jesus is it mispronounced  all right here he goes just pop it in man sink your teeth into it take a nice bite

[00:47:30]  what else are you preparing over there  it's the  it's the  boiled meat barbecue  on the O.P. and Anthony show  we have some smoked tongue  coming out right now  alright  the sheep testicles  are simmering  ok  and  remember no spices  no condiments  it's just  just boiled  you know barbecues  are such a huge part  of the 4th of July  weekend  now well  week  this  it's just like a barbecue  only we were  not allowed the open flame  so we have to boil everything 
[00:48:00]  right  and I think it's going very well  I agree  the duck feet  a big hit  so after the break  we'll eat the tripe  and what's that  again Iraq  this is the  the beef tongue  oh my god  this is ham  smells like corn beef  let me see  I'll bet you that's not as bad  that's probably not bad  it's just a piece of a cow  that's not bad  you'd eat that  I certainly wouldn't  what the hell does it look like  compared to a duck's foot  though  I'd eat the tongue  does it look like  sausage  looks like Canadian bacon  let me see  just tilt the plate 
[00:48:30]  yeah it does look  oh god  no  there's like  fibers in it  like  you know when you bite  your tongue  you feel like  crunch a little  it does smell  it smells like bacon  smelling it  no  this one's not going to be that bad  it looks kind of weird  but  but it smells tasty  it smells like  like ham  thick pieces of ham  alright we'll give that a try next  it's Opie and Anthony  we're back with the Opie and Anthony show  we're in the middle of our  boiled meat barbecue 
[00:49:00]  for 4th of July  and baby doll has arrived  and Patrice O'Neill has  entered the studio  so far we've tried the  the duck feet  duck feet didn't go over well  a lot of people  spitting it out  gagging  E-Rock has it caught  in between his teeth  and by the way  quickly Patrice  just noticing  out of nowhere  Jill Nicolini  he goes  who is that girl  she's gorgeous  you had no idea  I didn't even know  we dedicated a TV tour  say Jill TV  Jill TV  that's Jill Nicolini  she's alright man  she's alright 
[00:49:30]  when she's on TV  we refuse to change the channel  she looks a mess too  like  she looks like  she's got some problems  dude  we love her  because of that  it looks like  she's been out  at some Long Island  bar  or something  all night  she looks good  man  sorry about it  you want to see her  nude there  that's her nude  she got a job  she got a job  like informing people  isn't that great  it's amazing man  well slow down  she does the traffic  still she has a job 
[00:50:00]  where it's important  somebody  it's an important job  they used to have her  in the helicopter  until they realized  why are we  she's got great assets  on her  let's sit her down  at a desk  or have her stand up  she just points out  where she's caused accidents  bent over here  on the Gowanus  and who's  this middle act  who has a follower  see this is all the stuff  we're talking about  oh really  you already  oh we are so sorry  no this is good actually  Patrice  it's sort of like  you're you know  you're giving us some 
[00:50:30]  I  they got a little  I mean  and she's okay  but well  Jill is forcing her  to dress sexier  she never showed  cleavage like that  now she's got  oh and a little  turkey neck  she's tanning  she's tanning  and wearing like  low cut outfits  just to try to keep up  with Jill the young girl  and she's looking  like a poor man's  Laura Dern  remember  Laura Dern  from Jurassic Park  fame  yeah  but this other chick 
[00:51:00]  is wow  like not even like sexy  but she's on another level  of like  she shouldn't even be  on the news  no no  gorgeous  and then this poor thing  gotta come on and like  right after the traffic  and do the weather  oh she always gives her  a little look to the side  like thanks  and try to prove  that she got the job  by you know  having credentials  yeah  I was a meteorologist  I went to meteorology school  but we got it all figured out  we think Jill's gonna be  taking her job eventually  yeah  they got her out of the helicopter  now she's in the studio 
[00:51:30]  she does the longest traffic report  in local TV  like  oh Jill Nicolini  yeah everyone else's traffic  is two seconds  hers is about five minutes long  she's talking about side streets  yeah  and like the wine dance  anything to keep her on  anything to keep her on  anything to keep her on  hey talk about  oh yeah  she does side streets  from Miami to Toronto  she does sidewalk traffic  at this point  yeah  and you probably don't care  but in Oklahoma  there's a cow  tipped over  and they already threw her  behind the entertainment desk 
[00:52:00]  she's like  the traffic girl  is just sitting there  yeah she feels  no now she  she fills in  and does a little  entertainment reports  now too  when the other girl's out  oh there's nothing worse  than watching somebody  be groomed  yeah oh she's being groomed  big time  see here's Emily Francis  who does the entertainment  and sometimes she's out  and when she's out  they've already slid her  Jill comes in  and does a great job  at the entertainment  but I think they want her  to be the traffic  the weather girl  as soon as she's able  to spell Doppler  yeah yeah  but there she is 
[00:52:30]  she was in Playboy  that is pathetically  about four or five years ago  huh  why is she that good  that's amazing  she's that good looking  look at that shot  huh  look at that  that's not a shot  they would  that's not a shot  they would  have at Playboy  which street is that  that's the  that's the  that's the hobbit tunnel  yeah  thanks for the set up  Patrice  doesn't look like  there's any traffic  going into the tunnel  today  god is that night  can I see more  of that ilk 
[00:53:00]  iraq  ilk  very graphic photo  but it's what you want  to see  yeah that's good stuff  well yeah  I look like she's  being checked  for contraband  that makes you get  right up in the morning  oh my god  she can't get late for work  look at that  huh  alright  so there you go  so you notice  what we've been noticing  for a while  we dedicated a TV  to her and everything  every morning  that picture's great  it looks like a  boar's head truck  overturned on the expressway  and then my other friend  here that I  the other  the black girl  she's getting really fat  is she pregnant 
[00:53:30]  or is she just  she just  the anchor  I don't know  no one even  cares about her  she's a duller  and she's now  trying too hard  as well  she's starting to smile  and do all sorts  of things  see what dignity  trying to have dignity  always loses  when you get that  hot sexy thing  since she's trying  too hard  she's trying to smile  no she never  I mean  she never smiled  she always looked like  she didn't want to be there  so  that's a good shot  right there 
[00:54:00]  sorry I'm 20 days  late for that  jeez  it's good to know  that other people  think the exact same  any excuse to talk  about her  is fine  don't worry about it  we got some food  to eat here  we got  what do we got  what do we got  yeah what are we up to  the tripe  yeah  which is a cow stomach  we also have some  very thinly sliced  cow tongue  that's been  now everything's  just been boiled  it's our boil barbecue  yes  now who's gonna 
[00:54:30]  be brave  oh  I want Sam  to try everything  Sam's gotta try  because his reaction  is so good  he puts it in his mouth  for two seconds  and spits it out  he's like a junior  high school girl  if we deep fried it  you would try it  there was breading on it  I know  I know  breading yeah  he's got the diet  of an 8 year old  it tasted like a fish stick  well that's not gonna  that smells kind of like  ham or  some kind of a bacon  yeah but just knowing  what it is  yeah 
[00:55:00]  well who's trying it  let's get our triers  what are we doing  I'll try one  alright  Dan's gonna  try some of the tongue  I was all confident  just being like  I'm gonna do one of these  tongues  no big deal  but as you get closer  it's just flapping  oh  it's a flappy tongue  and the  it's a stringy  consistency  it looks like  you're painting  a very unflattering  sort of a starburst  what is that again  the cow tongue  this is sliced cow tongue  what's that skin  on the outside  or some kind of  fatty thing 
[00:55:30]  I think it's skin  like around the  Canadian bacon  kind of thing  yeah  you keep telling  yourself Canadian bacon  yeah  just lick it for a second  see what it tastes  nah  that's gonna be  that's gonna be  an easy one  is it  yeah go ahead  no nibble  no nibble  how about a big bite  give it a good  and then is  oh it's a little tough  it's a little stringy  I don't know what  these guys are  complaining about  this is crazy  yeah you picked  the easy one man 
[00:56:00]  sure did  what does it taste  like  some kind of  salami maybe  or  it really does  taste like  Canadian bacon  Canadian bacon  yeah  I miss almost  missed a stringy  part  wow he's actually  popping more in his  mouth  he's enjoying it  Danny is hungry now  he's like alright  I'll try it  take a bite  Danny what do you  think  well  I know I have to  because  because I have to  that was easy  yeah 
[00:56:30]  it's going down  it's surprisingly  not bad  yeah that one's  easy  that's almost a  palate cleanser  there you go  from the duck feet  I'm all sick  yeah  now we gotta go to  something else  Sam's actually gonna  swallow it  Sam liked it  so it's not that bad  see even I think  Sam could try that  yeah Sam it's not that  bad I think that  you should take a  bite of the  I can't eat ham  look at how mad he is  you can  he said he can't 
[00:57:00]  eat rice  he spits out rice  alright just at least  bite into it  yeah take a bite  and see what it  tastes like  see the problem is  you have this  annoyance about  this whole bit  that now we have  to focus on  and you gotta try  new things in life  you should have went like  ah it's no big deal  and spit it out  and move on  but you just  don't wanna do this  on any level  you gotta try new  things in life  come on now  just take a big bite  just a big bite  and chew  and let's try to  let's try to  chew for 10 seconds  yeah don't  don't just do the  spit out  the last one was 15 seconds 
[00:57:30]  so we'll knock it down  to 10 seconds  here we go  here it is  it's probably easier  to put the whole thing  in your mouth  than it is to rip off  gristle and chew  yeah  alright get a  bite and chew  for 10 seconds  get a good one  ok  alright he's chewing  he's chewing  see it's not that bad  you're doing a good job  he's chewing  that's the  what does it taste like  it just flew out of his mouth  oh god  what does it taste like  diluted Canadian bacon 
[00:58:00]  that was more fatty  than  he can't even describe it  he goes  you have a prison sex face  yeah  alright what do we got next  we got the  sheep's stomach  also known as tripe  tripe  this stuff is  disgusting  yeah  the consistency of this  is a little grisly  it's uh  who's gonna  who's gonna try this  it's kind of  like honeycomb pattern  uh  but they're all pointing around 
[00:58:30]  trying to get someone else  to try  uh  with your finger there  what does it feel like  ugh  just  slippery  well you know  this kind of  ew  it's hitting the plate  it's really heavy  it's like a piece of  thick bread with oil  soaked through with oil  it sounds like  yeah  that's exactly  let's say hi to Rick  in North Carolina  Rick what's up  hey how you doing  I haven't had tripe before  you know what it tastes like  it tastes like bad breath  it tastes  tripe tastes like bad breath  like bad breath 
[00:59:00]  yeah  you know  when you wake up  you got that nasty  taste in your mouth  yeah  that's what it tastes like  it's just nasty  alright  well we'll get  confirmation on that  in a minute  all those little  nooks and crannies  are the inside of the stomach  where all the nutrients  from the food  are absorbed in  and now you're gonna eat it  and your stomach's gonna do  the same thing to it  touche  I don't think it's gonna  make it that far  Danny what are you doing  you look like you're  gagging back there  what's the matter  what gotcha  Danny's tongue keeps

[02:22:30]  whatever  and whatever  you never invite me anywhere  whatever  whatever  and whatever  why do you think not  you're full of shit  you call jimmy  this is what jimmy does  you call him  hey  hey  first of all i consider jimmy a friend  we never talk  ever  i call him  hey jim what's going on  ah  ah  ah  dude i got  let me call you back  all right jim  this is why  because this is what stupid does  you're talking to him for a minute  he gets whatever information he needs 
[02:23:00]  when he calls you  uh-huh  and then you go  ah  so um  you get the cellulator  and it's like  just fucking hang up on that  that's wrapping  that's wrapping up the call  i'm 38  i know what wrapping  i want to talk to  i want  i  look at  we  our crew is just  the worst  oh yeah  yeah  pseudo friends  i don't know  colin quinn's number  uh  everybody  you know what it is  about our little crew  here's the sad thing  and  and  and what makes it fucked up  is you two  like in there somewhere 
[02:23:30]  somehow  yeah  we're all kind of  on the shore  right  but we're all trying to get famous  sneakily  mm-hmm  we all  we're all trying to get famous  behind everybody's back  and do things  like  that no one knows about  except for norton  norton is  is doing things up  but like me  and bob  and uh  and i don't  i don't  we  i haven't talked to billy  in a while  but everybody's  you know keith  everybody's like  hey what'd you do yesterday  had a little meeting 
[02:24:00]  what  well yeah yeah  about what  meeting where  i just  it's a thing  just meeting people  everybody wants to come out of the blue  like  yeah out of the blue  and miss me on the show  that's what i got  yeah  and that  and we're just a bunch of desperate old men now  grasping  well this is the type of friendships we have  my girlfriend  uh moved  and she was a little hurt  because she wanted her girlfriends to come over  and keep her company  while she packed  and she couldn't understand why her friends wouldn't  and i'm like  aww  socialize with different people  but if i called 
[02:24:30]  and i used you as an example  because whenever i need like  shit friend examples  that's great  you're good as a shit friend example  but we all are  in our  each  each way  each person  is their shitty friend  person  i'm an awful friend  but i'm a shitty friend very specifically  well i said if i called patrice and said  will you come over  look i gotta pack  i'm a little bummed out  will you please come over  and just sit with me  and talk to me while i do it  he would hang up on me  he wouldn't respond 
[02:25:00]  and neither would colin  call him a faggot  like what kind of faggot ass shit is that  and they can talk to me  colin wouldn't  colin would you know  shut your mouth  i tried to talk to colin on the phone  like just  can't  hey colin what's up  you see that  you see that norton  he has that fucking head  like  what do you want to hear  fat  all right colin  hey i'm just checking to see how you okay  don't be fucking trying to check on me  psychoanalyze him  deep down inside  and  shut the fuck up  and just  can you just say hello  for five minutes 
[02:25:30]  we're the worst group  keith  we're all just bad  people don't understand  me  i don't  i just because i don't call  or  got in get into conversation  doesn't mean i don't care about the people  like i  i care greatly about jimmy norton  i care greatly about opie  the calls we make  it's a context  it's always  it's like business or something  i rarely call jimmy  you know gavin  and go like  hey jim  what's up  well we spend five hours a day together too 
[02:26:00]  that's a bad example  that is true  yeah yeah  we talk about everything  it doesn't count  but i got friends too  that do like great things  they've done great things  got us like  housewarming gifts  and things like that  and i just  i blow it off  you know gavin  oh yeah yeah  yeah of course  he doesn't understand  explain gavin though  gavin is my buddy from england  six foot six  oh yeah  gavin looks like  he gave us the famous audio  of his friend  his friend getting fucked in the ass  with the dildo  yep  by a chick  by a girl  and he's just 
[02:26:30]  and there's nothing gay about him  gavin is a  is a pure viking  cause all man  if he was here with the meat things  he'd be like  i'll try that much  he'd dump it all in his mouth  and swallow it  he would laugh and smile  as he was chewing  oh he's a great guy  and a great character  he could have been in 300  that guy  he's that type of guy  he's not fucking around  he's just like winches  yeah yeah  like he uses a bitch  as an ottoman  you know  so  he doesn't understand about  like he's a square guy  meaning  he's a guy 
[02:27:00]  who if he's your friend  there's rules  he doesn't understand  that me and bobby  won't speak for six months  yeah  and on the sixth month  we call  and go  hey what you doing dude  like we won't go  what you been doing  for six months  oh my god  six months is like  nothing  if you don't speak to him  for six months  gavin will literally  start crying  like  what do i do mate  what's going on with you  gavin  we just decide  don't  we don't talk to each other  for months at a time  period  that's part of our relationship 
[02:27:30]  right  opi's like that very much  opi will be like  oh man  opi man  wait what  what am i like  opi  you can talk to opi  one thing that's consistent  about anthony  never talk to him  no  he's done  don't don't even try to  just hit that show  good laugh  goodbye  once that show is over  i don't talk to anybody  opi  will  from monday  to tuesday and a half  he'll be like  hey man  love you dude  wednesday to thursday and a half 
[02:28:00]  well that's because bob kelly  came  wednesday to thursday and a half  but that's because bob kelly came in  and now i gotta give him a little while  and then i forget about you  until the next time you come in  you gotta figure that shit out  yeah  you know what i mean  so you gotta figure out how to be everybody's friend  and that's the thing  that's the thing about this game  i had to learn how to be norton's friend  to say he's my friend  and to learn how to be key's friend  learn how to be bobby's friend  once you guys secretly start  someone's got a good idea 
[02:28:30]  secretly start uh you know  recording these phone calls  they usually end with a hang up  a lot of times they're not long  and it's not good  because we trash each other  behind each other's back  all the time too  yeah i can't do that  so it's not good  you just be like  ah that fucking norton in this book  what's that missing tape  yeah  fucking what is it  what is he talking about  chapter 3p  fucking dick  but there's really  and you love him  but it's that  it's that professional jealousy  yeah  what the fuck is norton talking about  you don't see anybody doing better than you  there's nothing we say 
[02:29:00]  being cunts  behind  there's nothing we say  behind each other's back  I would say like  whenever we go on  Stephen Queen  you would say it right to their face  oh yeah  absolutely  I gotta interrupt  because Kevin Smith has been online  for like 15 minutes  oh wow  listening to this babble  Kevin what's going on buddy  I mean you guys can sit there  and bullshit all you want  and it's entertaining to listen to  I can't believe nobody  nobody like dropped  everything they were doing  took a moment of silence  to acknowledge  Norton's Hal Holbrook 
[02:29:30]  star chamber joke  thank you very much  nobody has made a star chamber joke  since like maybe  fucking Saturday Night Live  circa 1983  that shit was brilliant  thank you  I'm always looking for a good  opportunity to squeeze  Hal Holbrook's name  I love that dumb movie too  that was so fucking obscure  I was dying for about 5 minutes  they should remake that movie  I think it would be great  I agree  but  well Kevin  boy how things change  over time  one of your 
[02:30:00]  I don't know  foils  in the business  nemesis  your nemesis  who you took on  who I might say  a gentleman  a fine note has passed  let's just leave it at that  I might say  you bullied  and brutalized  this gentleman  on our show  a fine note has passed  we should just leave it at that  yes  leave it at that  well  I was very surprised  to hear that  Joel Segal died  I mean believe me  I know I didn't add to it  but I mean in retrospect  apparently he was going 
[02:30:30]  through some horrible shit  yeah  who knew  you know  the guy kept it quiet  he kept it quiet  that's probably why  he got up and left the theater  I recall having the ultimate  last laugh  yeah  he showed you  he's like look  I went through that  whole argument  all I had to blurt out  was I got cancer  you asshole  totally  and you would have been like  you would have been like  oh shit  oh fuck  he kept what  colon cancer  back then in the moment  I thought like  alright I've got the ultimate  ace card up my sleeve  because the dude works  for Disney  and Miramax used to be 
[02:31:00]  part of Disney  Harvey and Bob Weinstein  used to be part of Disney  and so ultimately  I could slap him with  you work for the company  to fire my bosses  and that's why  you're fucking coming down  on the movie  he had the ultimate  ace up his sleeve  yes he did  at any moment  could have just dropped like  uh P.S. fat ass  I am dying of cancer  oh my god  yeah  yeah  he got you  last laugh  you're actually  Kevin  you're the first guy  I thought of  when I read  Joel Siegel died  it's weird  like the first thing  I thought of  Kevin was dragged  into some of the articles  oh that was 
[02:31:30]  that was painful too  dragged in a little bit  hey you were right though  dude  you took a critic on  critics to me  are completely irrelevant  uh regardless of their health  and you  you uh  you know  I really  but I mean they are  I find what they do  to be  largely irrelevant  and I like the fact  that you address the guy  behaves self-righteously  but do you recall  at the end of the day  I certainly don't regret  you know  my position  which was like  if you're gonna leave  the theater  just don't  I'm fine with him  leaving the theater  just don't  say anything  the fact that you 
[02:32:00]  brutalized an old man  who was sick  you brutalized an old man  who was sick  but you didn't know  you didn't know  he was sick  when you humiliated him  in front of his grandchildren  you didn't know  he was ill  oh my god  I don't think Ebert's  doing well either  no there's something  in that  that that that  that butter  that fake butter  or something  you think that's  at the popcorn butter  they're watching  too many movies  and they're dying  of weird crap  something's going on  is Ebert really sick  like I saw photos  of Ebert  yeah he had his jaw  removed or something  I've sat in for Ebert  on his show  about three four times 
[02:32:30]  now because  yeah yeah  he had some sort  of esophageal  problems there  was he a smoker  I don't think  he was a smoker  way back in the day  he had his jaw  removed  scraped  and then put him  backwards  some crazy procedure  doesn't that scare  the crap out of you  when somebody  he's still right  and he just can't  get on the show  because I don't think  he I think he's  in speech therapy  right now  and he would horrify  the children  let's be honest  oh wow  whenever you hear  about cancer  or something  the first thing  you ask  and I always do  it is like  well do they smoke 
[02:33:00]  I want to know  that they somehow  contributed  and I'm not  contributing by not smoking  like those things  colon and pancreas  what did they eat  what did they do  I bet they had a bad diet  or something  and it's like  no the picture of health  exercised every day  and then you're like  oh Jesus Christ  this could just come  out of nowhere  one of those things  colon can't you just go  and I just hope  diabetes is enough  and you're like  come on God  you don't want to give me  nothing else do you  people are saying  look see I gotta remember  never to walk out  of a Kevin Smith movie  see people are actually 
[02:33:30]  equating that with his illness  you were great in Die Hard  man I didn't  like I was  these guys saw the Die Hard  movie there Kevin  I know I saw Anthony  and Norton there  where were you sir  I accosted him  on the red carpet  I was so annoyed  at the way like Fox  didn't get us in there  or anything  and I was prepared  to hate it  it really was good man  this is a totally  good movie isn't it  yeah the action's great  and you know something  it's funny  without trying to be like  the fourth time around 
[02:34:00]  same kind of funny  yeah they don't do  a lot of reference jokes  like there's really  only one reference joke  where like there's  an FBI agent  who goes on  Agent Johnson  and Bruce goes  Agent Johnson  and that's it  yeah yeah  that was kind of  a good callback  but the kid was  really funny man  yeah Justin Long  I thought he was  and that's  how fucking  have you ever watched  a movie at Radio City  Music Hall  no  that is like  the best theater  to see a movie in  the sound was fantastic  the screen's huge 
[02:34:30]  yeah  yeah how did that  look for you  sitting there  watching your giant  head on a screen  like that  I mean as fat  as I felt  I felt even fatter  when I saw myself  at Radio City Music Hall  I was like  good god  I gotta stop eating  that was good  I saw you  take your seat  as me  my girlfriend  Jimmy and his girlfriend  were being kicked  out of our seats  and moved further  to the back  of the theater  we were just  treated like  the scourge  I love  and then we're  just looking  we found four seats 
[02:35:00]  together  and we had the tickets  with the black  reserved band  around them  but we didn't know  there were special  special tickets  we had special tickets  but there's special  special tickets  so we found  four seats together  and we're like  cool great seats  four together  me Jimmy  my girlfriend  Jimmy's girlfriend  and then this woman  comes up and goes  oh you can't sit here  so we didn't argue  with her but we wanted  like kind of an explanation  and she gave one  that these seats  are numbered  and  her explanation  was all animals  are equal  some animals  are more equal  than others  exactly 
[02:35:30]  more important people  were coming in  than us  so she goes  there are seats  back there  so we look in the back  and like  we barely got to sit  with our own chicks  Jimmy turned around  at one point  like eight aisles  in front of me  and just gave this  disgusted look  like we couldn't even  we couldn't even  have our seats  I would have preferred  to sit in front of  John Wilkes booth  it was just  an awful situation  and we just wanted  to be treated nicely  Kevin was nice  he's like one of the  only really famous guys  that is nice to you 
[02:36:00]  and he doesn't have to be  he's a nice guy  I'm not famous dude  oh yes you are  yeah you're famous  you're ridiculous  you gotta stop downplaying it  like when 6,000 people  are screaming for Bruce Willis  that's fucking  you know  I'll give you that  but I was also  paying attention  to whenever  when the movie started  and the names  that popped up  on the screen  and then the first time  people appeared  on the screen  and Kevin Smith  got a huge ovation  you got a huge ovation 
[02:36:30]  from that crowd man  it was kind of nice  I'll admit that  I think it just had to do  with like  everyone in the movie  is introduced  pretty fucking early  and I don't show up  until like an hour  into the picture  so I think it just  caught people off guard  they're like  oh that fucking fat fuck  is in the movie too  what the hell is he doing  at the door  did you see the publicist  try to get us off  the red carpet  me and Anthony  oh was that funny  we couldn't have looked  more like we didn't belong  oh we were getting  thrown off every two seconds  there's nothing better  than walking the red carpet  as you're being thrown  off of it 
[02:37:00]  we were actually walking  behind people  who were doing  legitimate interviews  instead of waiting  for our turn  yeah waving behind people  we're the worst  but we stopped scourge  I forget who I was talking to  when you guys came up  and then I just kind of  brought you into the interview  and what not  but the whole time  the whole time  Norton had this look  on his face like  nobody knows  but I just killed a hooker  five minutes ago  you know  like some weird  guilt face on  just frozen  like Cindy Brady  it was right before  that woman had just come over  a minute before we saw you 
[02:37:30]  and she said  well do you guys have tickets  which is never what you want  to hear about a red carpet  that's never how a celebrity  is treated  do you have tickets  Mr. Willis  we said yes  and she goes  well you might want  to go around this way  and she pointed back  down the red carpet  like guys  the real star move  is to double back  on the red carpet  there are no photos  were taken  when you first walked  so you get to the pavement  and get online  shit dicks  oh my god  but I dropped your name  I'm like now we gotta do  a thing with Kevin Smith  which we didn't  we had to bother you  no  I got lucky 
[02:38:00]  throw you off the red carpet  I had a cop  I couldn't be bothered  with that whole thing  I had a cop  and then I got lucky  because right in front  of one of the people  in charge  two photographers  started taking pictures  of me and my girlfriend  because he recognized me  from the radio show  so he started snapping pictures  and a couple of the people  turned around  and went oh okay  I guess he's somebody  yes  they didn't know who  what's Patrice laughing at  I'm just laughing at you  exactly why  I'm not telling him  to come to my party  but that's hope goes  I don't go to that horse shit  well no I mean 
[02:38:30]  in all fairness  I went to that horse shit  a few times  and was treated just like that  I'm like I'll go see the movie  on my own time  I'm not gonna put myself  in that position  I agree  where you're on the red carpet  I've been on the red carpet  and Jimmy described it perfectly  all of a sudden  like oh I'm obviously  how do you get on  I'm obviously not supposed  to be here  people are like  shattering on the sides  and are coming up to you  it's like fuck that  but how do you get on  the red carpet  I'll wait a week or two  and I'll go see it  in some dumb theater somewhere  so anybody can get on  the red carpet  and then they have to decide  whether you belong there or not  if you got the right cop 
[02:39:00]  you could get on the red carpet  it's staying on the red carpet  other people get on  because they have a publicist  and you're on the list  and all that  the talent is remaining  on the carpet  and if you sign  a couple of things  somebody will see you signing  and go oh okay  I can't fuck with this person  because I'm just not sure  who they are  and I would have signed  anything  so it's just  it's just arbitrary  I don't think these guys belong  right  yeah  yeah  because the big stars  everyone knows who the big stars  are  you want Kevin 
[02:39:30]  and stay on a red carpet  would be to have a plant  standing near  like the red carpet  that the moment you hit it  they try to get an autograph  from you  or ask for a picture  anybody can make it  into a  to a premier screening  if you have a plant  right on the red carpet  going oh can I get your autograph  can I get your picture  and shit like that  because then the people  who are guarding the screening  are like maybe there's somebody  I don't recognize them  that's why I started signing  because a couple of fans  from K-Rock were there  and they had those  those fan things  that they were handing out  and I signed the back of a few 
[02:40:00]  and again people saw that  and went all right  there's got to be somebody  I don't know who the fuck it is  but  what was the red carpet event  we went to at  was it the WWE restaurant  before it went back to Hard Rock  and I swear to god  nothing's more uncomfortable  than when you see celebrities  walking  and then all the paparazzi  and photographers  go up and  they're flashbulbs everywhere  everywhere  even though they're not  flashbulbs anymore  I did let them  with a like  fucking Lindsay Lohan  yeah yeah  and then we walked through  or I did  maybe this was when  I was by myself 
[02:40:30]  I don't know  and the same people  that were just going nuts  flashing like crazy  not  there was one guy  being polite  going click  and I'm like  you know what  I don't need to put myself  to this shit  I'll go  I'll go  and I  look this way  could you look that way  look this way  but I was asked  to go to this thing  I forgot what it was  it wasn't like  I was trying to like  hang with the celebrities  and stuff  I was asked  and then I'm like  why did I put myself  in this position  one guy lifted up  his camera for one shot  and I'm like  holy shit  I did Letterman 
[02:41:00]  with like fucking  Tom Cruise's wife  or something  one of them people  and I got  I came up in one of those  dark limos or something  I got out  and they were flashing  when I got out  they all went  oh  oh jeez  because their reaction  as soon as they see  the limos  just start taking pictures  and then somewhere  in their brain  they realize  wait a minute  I'm taking a lot  of pictures  of a nobody  right now  in their world  anyway  I have a little  of that coming  my way this week  I got a  Affleck said  hey man  do you want to  go join us 
[02:41:30]  there's a poker  tournament  in Vegas  that Don Cheadle  is throwing  for some  it's a Darfur  benefit  or something like that  he's going up  it'll be fun  I was like  right on  so I joined up  then I saw  the fucking list  of people  who were going  and it's like  Brad Pitt  fucking George Clooney  Adam Sandler  I'm like  oh I don't want  to be in that room  why  why  because there's  a bunch of people  just going like  who the fuck are you  there's Adam Sandler  fuck off  then Kevin  kind of feels  what we get to feel 
[02:42:00]  see it never ends  because in Kevin  Smith's circle  they would look at us  like who the fuck  are those guys  no but he made  Ben Affleck famous  Kevin really  helped Ben Affleck  oh yeah  so I mean  Ben kind of owes you  a lot  but not  I mean  I mean  that's such old news  at this point  it's just  no no no  if it wasn't for you  there's no daredevil  I want to help out  the cause  but I don't want  to fucking  sit there  and feel uncomfortable  the whole time  is it inappropriate  Kevin  could you get  Don Cheadle  on our show  I love Don Cheadle  that guy's fantastic 
[02:42:30]  yeah he's a good actor  I met  that's the other weird thing  like I met with Don Cheadle  back in 97  about being in Dogma  and he was a great guy  and a great actor  but then you know  Chris Rock popped up  and I was like  oh I love Chris Rock  I wonder if the dude  will even remember  cause Don Cheadle's gone on  and done some pretty big things  but like  I remember everything  I remember everything  every time I met with somebody  who later on  like didn't fucking  want to know from me  or whatever  I just wonder if I get there  and the dude's like  hey I remember our meeting  thanks for not casting me  in that fucking picture 
[02:43:00]  and you think  Cheadle probably won't remember you  I doubt it  I'm sure if I had me  he'd be like  hey nice to meet you  and I'll be the only one  remembering our meeting  he'll remember you  and he'll snub you horribly  in front of people  believe me  he'll pay you back  he'll snub you horribly  you think Chris Rock's  more talented than me  fuck you  take table six  yeah I know  I mean Chris Rock's  a great comic  but as far as actors  are concerned  that was an odd move  Chris Rock as an actor  over Cheadle  yeah I mean  I stand by my decision 
[02:43:30]  Chris Rock funny  in that movie  fuck you  that's very funny  and they're an asshole  let's say it  I like Chris Rock  as a comedian  no no no  Jesus Christ  say what you really feel  Don Cheadle's a better actor  I mean that's not a  that's not a big  I think Chris Rock  would have meant that  I think it would have been  a little too serious  now if I would have said  Chris Rock's a better actor  than Don Cheadle  that would have been  panning  let me ask you a question  I'm only halfway  in this business  let's say  could Chris Rock  possibly  possibly think  he's as good an actor  as Don Cheadle  no  like even  I don't think 
[02:44:00]  even in a  in a  in a fictitious  crazy Hollywood way  could he go  like would he laugh  at what you just  like would he go  of course  Don Cheadle's better than me  or would he go  why  what's I don't  what are you trying to say  there are things  you would cast  Chris Rock in  that you wouldn't cast  Don Cheadle in  but I don't think  Chris Rock  would assume  but in the Hollywood ego  you think Chris Rock's like  I would read  for things Don Cheadle  and I should get it  Oscar  winning movies  and stuff  Chris Rock would be the first one  to tell you that he's not  the actor that Don Cheadle is  I think Chris Rock would 
[02:44:30]  cop for that in a second  it's a mute point really  you ever see the  you know  Oscar winning  you ever see the  Oscar winning movies  that Don Cheadle's been in  hey he was very good  in Hotel Rwanda  Hotel Rwanda was great  great comedy  if you haven't seen that  he was great  by the way  they are remaking  the Star Chamber  it's coming out in 2009  instead of Hal Holbrook  who's doing it  who's doing it  I don't know  well  I just assumed  this was true  because somebody wrote in  on the instant feedback  maybe we should look it up 
[02:45:00]  maybe you ought to look it up  one of my favorite  Hal Holbrook movies  was Creepshow  just tell it to call you Billy  when that monster  was in the box  oh and she's just like  what the hell  would you do without me  yeah he was fantasizing  about shooting her  in the head  sexy ass  Adrian Barbeau  Adrian Barbeau  that was her  yeah  she's John Carpenter's wife  I wonder if he's still married  John Carpenter married  yes  are you sure  no but I think so  yeah I think  I think he was  she was with John Carpenter  for a long time 
[02:45:30]  yeah he directed  he directed the Swamp Thing  he directed the Swamp Thing  he directed her  she was in The Fog  The Fog  she was in a couple of his movies  she was in Escape from New York  she played that  big titted monster  running around with brain  that fucking stupid  Harry Dean Stanton  Donald Pleas  with his lack of finger  we get it  fucking Jake Plisky  and he dressed like Steve  our producer  his fucking shitty shirt  fucking homoerotic shirt  I heard you were dead  that could have been  the best worst movie  ever made

[02:47:00]  and over  and the worst part  was the 80's  fucking awful villain  he dressed like  a music video  Billy Idol  the guy who was like  who brought the  president's finger  fuck him  and Stephen Hubley  what a shitty  fucking  season Hubley  was in it  damn  Jimmy knows  everything about that movie  season Hubley  always played a hooker  she should have  season Hubley  and Wingshauser  fucking yeah  Wingshauser  yeah  Wingshauser  where the fuck 
[02:47:30]  it's Coco  bitch  you see Vice Squad  I'm Vice Squad  Norton has no life  just like me  why do you  season Hubley  the fucking  best  Nina Blackwood  from MTV  was in Vice Squad  a fucking  hooker  that Wingshauser  beat to death  she stole money  Wingshauser  was the greatest  pimp  other than  Morgan Freeman  Wingshauser  was like a  poor man's  Ruster Hauer  he shouldn't have 
[02:48:00]  been  he should have  been an actual  man's Wingshauser  along with  along with  the most  underrated actor  in the history  my favorite actor  of all time  who's never been  famous  is the  motherfucker  that played  the guard  in Shawshank Redemption  oh god damn  that guy  Viking and Bad Boys  yes  he was in Bad Boys  yeah  with Sean Penn  what's that guy's name  that was tweeted  you assholes  that fucker  is tremendous  oh that's the guy  that says the voice  of Lex Luthor  on the Superman 
[02:48:30]  cartoon  Clancy Brown  is that his name  Clancy Brown  very good  Kenneth Smith's  in front of a  computer right now  he shows up  in something  that much I recall  but I was  looking at the new  StarCraft on IMDB  and they just have  they just have a title  2009 but nobody  attached to it yet  well there's  a fucking great  a great scene  one of my favorite  scenes in Vice Squad  which I'm dying  it's so quotable  Vice Squad  there's a great scene  where Nina Blackwood  oh yeah  she ripped off Ramrod  the pimp  played by Wingshauser 
[02:49:00]  Ramrod  and he's at a hotel  he's at a hotel  and he's going  open the door  Ginger  I think her name was Ginger  Ginger was the one  he beat with the hanger  but he's trying to get  and she's like  you ain't gonna hit me  Ramrod  and he's like  baby I just want  to love you  and he's rubbing  his knuckles  on the door  like he can't wait  to get his hands  on this thieving  punch of a hooker  he can't wait  wait what did you see  when he hit  Season Hubbly  in the chair  with a stool  when the cops  came in  he said  you snitched on me  bitch  and he hit her  in the head  with a stool  twice 
[02:49:30]  he opened  he opened  the door  here's why  Season Hubbly  was only trying  to hurt Ramrod  because he beat  Nina Blackwood  to death  he beat Ginger  to death  but he talked  Ginger into  opening the door  and she goes  you ain't gonna  hit me Ramrod  and he goes  I just want  to love you  and she opens  the door  and he breaks it  and he grabs  her hair  and he goes  I cannot believe  how stupid  you are  and it's the greatest  realization  that you fucked up  and boy  you ever see  Vice Squad Opie  no I have not  dude it's a fucking 
[02:50:00]  great film  that's why I haven't  talked the last 15 minutes  I have it on video  it's a great film  I'm gonna search it out now  we'll have to have a viewing  what I did to Ginger  ain't gonna be nothing  compared to what I do to you  well how about  the fucking  the fucking  the black guy  Roscoe  when he's handcuffed  he goes  come on Roscoe  move your black ass  he holds a fucking  hacksaw  to Ramrod's neck  you white motherfucker  don't you  I'll cut your motherfucker  don't talk that  trappy shit to me  motherfucker  wait a minute 
[02:50:30]  cause you know what  the whole movie  Wingshauser  had been pretending  to be nice  and then he would do  something fucked up  to you right after  so he would go  hey can I get a dollar  you give him a dollar  and he'll stab you  so the black dude  was the only motherfucker  that go  nigga I know you  motherfucker  I'll cut your  motherfucking head off  well he wanted to buy  a car from this  fucking guy Roscoe  and he only had  five hundred bucks  and Roscoe goes  five hundred  don't get you  no El Dorado  it was the most  quotable film ever  obviously  rerun  Fred Berry 
[02:51:00]  is in  he plays  sugar pip  named Dorsey  sugar pip  Dorsey  and he kicks  him in the balls  he grabs him  by his  wings  grabs him  by his balls  and rerun  and rerun  and rerun  goes  oh I'm sorry  man  it was a big  faggot  sugar pip  no he  he fucking  he goes  here's what  happened  he's fucking  looking for this  girl  and he puts  fucking  silk robe  wearing  Fred Berry  against the wall  and he goes  you know what the  problem with you  sugar pimps is  and he takes out  a switchblade  and he goes 
[02:51:30]  you ain't got  no balls  boy  and he jams  him with the  switchblade  and rerun  goes  what is wrong  you gotta see  Vice Squad  dude  I'm gonna look  it up  I cannot believe  that's why  no season  hook  there's a new  DVD out of it  it came out  like three months  ago  is that on  DVD finally  yeah it just  came out about  three months  alright I'm  picking it up  today  I gotta see  Vice Squad  the guy that  plays the  fucking  Paul Newman  wannabe  the guy who  plays like  the fucking 
[02:52:00]  head Vice  Squad  what's his  name  I made it a  point to know  everybody's name  in that stupid  movie  but he hasn't  done anything  since  everybody does  Law and Order  that's one thing  oh it's on  everyone's  IMDB  if you ain't  seen a  motherfucker  in years  he did a  Law and Order  episode  that's on  DVD Kevin  see that's  what I was  dying for  to get quotes  for the show  there's so  many  like there's  one scene  where Ramrod  is looking  for the hooker  so he pulls  up to this  Asian hooker  and he goes  hey have you 
[02:52:30]  seen Coco  and she goes  are you a cop  baby  do I look  like some  kind of  fucking pig  but then he  grabbed her  he grabbed her  by her head  and drove off  with a feet  hanging out  the window  kicking out  the door  and he beat  him up  half to death  and he threw  in a garbage  pile  and he threw  in the garbage  and then ran  over a black hooker  just to get  seasoned  hopefully  just to kill  her  just to kill  seasoned  Ramrod was  hot under the  collar  dude if you 
[02:53:00]  see  he was one  of the greatest  pimps in the  movie  he hit  he hit her  in the head  twice  with a stool  and then threw  the stool  at the cops  he said  you snitch on me  bitch  clunk clunk  and then threw  the stool  at the cops  and then they  they wrestled  him down  and he said  I'm gonna  fucking kill  you bitch  so the whole  movie  was him  being looked  for for  murder  but he was  driving around  the city  in this  in this  Eldorado  that the  black dude  sold him  to kill  seasoned  humbly  the hooker 
[02:53:30]  one of the  best lines  ever  there's a  cheesy  cop  team  of a  white  guy  and a  black  female  they know  the whole  fuck  everything  inside out  I love it  the black  girl  the black  cop  when she  pulls  the gun  and she  goes  blink your  eyes  motherfucker  and you  die  in the  dark  you know  who that  lady was  no  she played  the vice  principal  in  lean on  me  the one  that said  hey  the guy  goes  I'm  the H  NIC  and then  the white  guy goes  what's that  mean  head  nigga  in  charge 
[02:54:00]  that's  who that  cop was  she probably  got everything  Roxy Roker  went out for  and didn't get  till it  jefferson  Jesus  oh my god  I thought I was  the only asshole  who watched  Vice Squad  12 million times  how many times  have you seen it  Jimmy  I don't know  but I have it  on video  I just saw it  the other night  I'm sitting there  I gotta get that  on DVD  I watch it  every time  it comes on  I won't watch  it on regular  television  cause you can't 
[02:54:30]  Wings  other than  Morgan Freeman  and Street Smart  Wings House  is the best  movie pimp ever  I gotta get  the DVD  now  you don't love  that fucking  movie dude  alright  well  there you go  hey we'd like  to thank  Kevin Smith  for  not hold  just sitting there  for 25 minutes  listening to a  I can sit back  and appreciate  two people  appreciating  an obscure  picture man  fucking  grade L movie  fantastic  alright man 
[02:55:00]  well yeah  we were just  thinking about you  well like we  should think about you  and feel sorry  you know  we'll think about you man  if there's anything  you need  well no one knew  the guy was sick  is what it comes down  to man  he didn't sound right  but  I would say  that maybe  a visit to  St. Patrick's  Cathedral  would be in order  but not  the program  oh yeah  I think we're still  we've still got a few years  before we're able to go in there  there was somebody  on the carpet  that brought that up too 
[02:55:30]  they were like  hey you're going to  St. Pat's  you're like  yeah thanks  you should have seen  when me and Ant  are walking into  the actual theater  there's a little  paparazzi stop  and the two low  self esteem idiots  we are  just standing there  and I actually had to say  to the photographers  please take our pictures  please  and they did  they showed mercy  they showed mercy  did they print it anywhere  we were in front of the big  we were in front of the big  die hard poster  and uh  they just like  you hear 
[02:56:00]  like okay thank you  they just held up  they didn't even waste  the fucking digital space  they just held up cameras  and made the noise  with their mouths  go stupid  hold on  I'm going to look it up  on Wire Image  and see if they put up  any pictures of you guys  they wouldn't have  at all  I don't know  there were a lot of people  there man  not a lot of people  in terms of like  star power  maybe you guys  might have made it on  maybe we got lucky  well we're looking up  Wire Image right now  Bruce Willis  was there  I showed apparently 
[02:56:30]  with Demi Moore  and Ashton Kutcher  and their lovely children  and uh  you know  that's kind of weird  that they all hang out together  that whole arrangement  yeah  well we got  Dennis Leary  with Opie and Anthony  we got  you guys at my book signing  yeah  I'm sorry  it's mostly pictures of us  when we're getting in trouble  there's me in front of some  FHM banner  I don't remember that  yeah  there's no  there's no real  there's no real images here 
[02:57:00]  oh that's us with  white stripes  or actually  Raconteur  what else  let's move down  move down  the other way  Iraq the other way please  Iraq move down quickly  before I slap you in the face  the other way  yeah to the top  I didn't see  where's the picture of you  man without a beard and shit  of who Anthony  no Opie  oh  I don't always  I don't know  what's the date on this picture  August 3rd 2004  where's that 
[02:57:30]  wow  where is that  if you hit Opie and Anthony  there's you know  there's like two pages of pictures  you guys look like  you're in some kind of  high tech  oh no  that was when we went down XM  and signed our contract  and then they wanted  publicity photos  look at my neck  that's an awful one  right  this is a picture we talk about  all the time  there was a guy that decided  to photoshop our faces  and he made my neck  extra long  because he took a  he took a head  from another picture 
[02:58:00]  and put it on that one  because he liked Anthony's look  and I said  please don't do that  he goes  no  don't worry  it will look great  and if you click on the picture  then there's like two  there's like five pictures  for that same  yeah  now look at the third one  and look at how small  my neck is  in the third picture  the first one  I have giraffe neck  and then look at the last two  in the bed  in the first picture  you look like the alien  from Close Encounters  dude  yeah  yeah  yeah exactly  it's ridiculous  and I told this guy  please do not  photoshop 
[02:58:30]  and the makeup girl  was ridiculous  this looks like you guys  are on the set of  THX 1138  yeah  this was supposed to be  you know  the first picture  that they were going to send  to everybody out there  after being off radio  for two and a half years  and that's what they  every newspaper in America  ran that fucking picture  and I begged the guy  please don't do that  and usually we don't care  about you know  how our picture's taken  but this was so god awful  we finally had to  put our foot down  and go look  dude  redo it  find something else 
[02:59:00]  look at the bad  makeup job  on the last two  it's a Ronald Reagan  makeup  yeah  pancake  so whatever  love it  alright  hey you wanna  that's a good idea  Thin has a good idea  we made a video there  Kevin  are you on your computer  alright go to  break.com  break.com  yeah  I also want my acting  showcase  because I admire  Kevin's pictures  very much  yeah  called Tom Hagen  and I would like to  this is the last thing  we do with Kevin today  because I'm sure  he's a busy man  alright  put in 
[02:59:30]  big boy makes a duty  in the search engine  this is our latest creation  big boy  makes a duty  D-O-O-D-Y  hey Iraq  are you with me or what  go to break.com  D-O-O-D-Y  D-O-O-D-Y  yes  common misspelling of duty  is with I-E  Gary Swanson  alright  we're trying to get this  on the front page  but why don't we get a review  from Kevin Smith  why don't you play this  it's about a minute  yeah  crank up the volume too  loading up now  here we go  alright  hey Jimmy 
[03:00:00]  what happened in there  big boy made a duty  did someone say  big boy made a duty  I can't believe  we're showing  Kevin Smith this  go  holy shit  bye bye  bye bye 
[03:00:30]  bye bye  with shit on his hand  my god  who is that  what do you think  that's our intern Jared  and that's the real deal  by the way  we're not going for  one of those fake videos  no that looked like  the real deal  yeah yeah 
[03:01:00]  that was one of  Jimmy's creations  in the toilet  it sat there  for a good hour and a half  before he  I was reading the paper  I get very sad  at world events  and that's how my body reacts  just forces everything  well let's get into this  for a couple  you need a little metamucil  on that diet sir  now Kevin  let's get into this  a little bit  your review  the acting  the cinematography  the acting is a little  over the top  the score  yeah  but the  I mean in terms of  impact  it certainly makes  an impression  wait wait wait 
[03:01:30]  I thought my acting  I thought I was very  believable  well that little  dance move  you did  yeah  you are no  Alan Alda sir  I'm going to say that  oh  oh you broke his heart  Alan Alda  how would Alan Alda  he would have went  yes  a big boy  made a duty  and he would have  guessed your  big with his hand  what  tell me that dude  got paid  to pick up  a load of shit  300  300 dollars  300 dollars  200  520s 
[03:02:00]  oh my god  that's  I don't get easily  nauseous  but that fucking  that hit me  like a gut punch  I know  I hated giving up  that money  we've had some  gross shows  the last few days  but that's our  latest creation  big boy makes  a duty  I don't think  I mean I'm trying  to think if I've  ever touched  another person's  shit  I mean maybe  like when my  kid was an infant  and I had to  wipe her ass  but like  what is that  sensation  what goes through  your mind  when you're  touching somebody  else's waist  depends on how  much you've  spent to do it  like if you  feel really bad  about yourself 
[03:02:30]  if you've  specifically told  the dominatrix  no laxative  and if she  squats over you  a fucking  like a little  one of those  things that they  put up a  suppository  shoots out of  her ass and  bounces off  your chest  followed by  a stew  shoo fly pie  believe me  Kevin did you  understand that  Jared was trying  to put a little  duty hat on the  duty  no not at all  he was wearing  the big duty 
[03:03:00]  hat and then  we had a little  duty hat that  was supposed to  go on the  duty  and we had a  lot of practice  we went through  about ten takes  because he's  putting a little  hat on it  yeah  the little  duty hat  on it  I thought the  impression was  just like  watch this dude  do this fucked  up thing  I didn't know  there was an  actual intent  behind it  except to pick  up the poo  see a whole  storyline  just picking up  the poo  that's college  that's college  video stuff  we wanted to  have a little  story  we wanted 
[03:03:30]  character  development  we wanted  character development  it was a real  you know  it was basically  like one of the  little rascals  episodes that  Hal Roach  didn't write  the dark years  yeah  so out of five  stars what do you  give it  five stars  I go three  wow  or we should  go with logs  so three logs  I think the  director's cut  will be a lot  better  we can't get  over the fact  that he didn't  like the overacting 
[03:04:00]  I think that's  what kind of  drags it back  a little bit  but the sheer  fucking chutzpah  it takes to  dig your hand  into a toilet  and touch  another man's  fucking logs  boy that deserves  three alone  but I'm hurt  that my acting  was crazy  how long did  it take for him  to wash that  smell off  and he washed  for the rest  of the show  yeah for hours  oh it stays  dude if you're  wiping your ass  and the toilet  paper breaks  and you get  some shit  on your finger  I mean you  wash a lot  and there's  always a faint  detectable  fucking scent  it's a whole 
[03:04:30]  day of  you know  holding something  up to your mouth  as you eat  something and  going oh  fuck  still got shit  there  I'm trying to  eat a sandwich  alright  well  well Kevin  thank you  very much  but Jimmy's  still depressed  what's wrong  Jimmy  I admire Kevin's  pictures very much  and I felt that  maybe he and I  would someday  work together  not necessarily  a starring role  but some type  of an action role  maybe where I run in  and I'm like  get out of here  everybody quick  it's gonna blow  you were much more 
[03:05:00]  subtle in Lucky Louie  this was a  you know you were  going for over the  top on this one  I was saying  yeah but didn't you  like the kind of  the arm thing  yeah I felt like  I liked the little  Popeye move  it was a Popeye move  that was it  my motivation was  how would a big boy  feel if he just  made a duty  can you use your  influence in Hollywood  to maybe help us out  we want to get this  video out there  oh yeah  that's what he wants  to get behind  I'm gonna hitch my  wagon to that store  I'm having a hard  fucking scat movies 
[03:05:30]  we've shown you  the baby bird video  right  oh god  alright one more  do baby bird  and break.com  this one now  we want your  review on this one  we're proud of this  one  and by the way  this is the hit  no special effects  no CGI  right this is real  alright you got it  hold on I'm pulling  it up now  baby bird  yeah you see a big  guy that's bald  baby bird  classic ONA  the baby bird video  there you go

[03:06:30]  oh you're kidding  me  no  I'll just  wait  hold on to your  stomach  like Dan said  no CGI  this is the real  deal  when you think  it's over  it ain't  by the way  we want this  link  eggnog  it was our  eggnog drinking  contest  72 double shots  something like  that  before he had  to let go  oh my god dude

[03:08:30]  is while  he's vomiting  like it's  second nature  and the sheer  volume of it  unfortunately  at one point  the dude  he's puking  on  kind of  like um  spits it  back a little  bit  like kind  of blows  his nose  out  and Pat  jumps  back  like I  don't want  to get  hit by  the vomit  yeah he  jumps back  he doesn't  want to  splash back  alright so  that's the  better video  we love  that one  that's  and if  you go to  kevin smith's

[03:10:00]  started with  like 12 guys  Pat beat  everybody by  far and then  continued to  drink the  eggnog until  he was about  to puke  Joe Rogan  came up with  that idea  on the spot  and we went  with it  so he kept  drinking and we  had Pat in  place for when  he had to  finally puke  because if  Joe Rogan  came up with  that on the  spot  there's enough  tarp all  over that  floor  that you've  got  we knew  yeah we  knew that  people were  going to  puke  oh no that  was because  people were  pukeing all  morning long  they were  doing the  eggnog  drinking contest  Pat is a  professional  he's doing

[03:15:30]  guy i liked him i like your younger brother he's like the normal one in the family normal job on wall  street you know couple kids house in the suburbs what one got black hair though right yeah yeah  that's uh brett who's quinn's twin then you met they don't even look like alike they're not they're  they're paternal uh yeah yeah yeah the one that isn't identical they're not identical right quinn  seems really normal which is frightening well quinn he probably likes feet now quinn's got his own 
[03:16:00]  issues he likes toes but he only likes hammer toes he can only get turned on to some of his hammer toes  that's lovely yeah i've seen quinn knock guys out twice his size he's not he's not right he used to  play rugby nice guy but he's now oh that's the guy i met that was yeah yeah yeah with the wall yeah  his crew is his crew has definitely got us all those guys description for roofies well all those guys  they uh played rugby together they're kind of all like married with kids but you know back in the  day not too many years ago they they were always in crazy bar fights just and unlike you he hangs out 
[03:16:30]  with different ethnic groups i hang out with the ethnic groups what uh german no can't count different  white groups but brett's the owner of fh riley's and you've been invited but you haven't showed up yet  because you don't go to long island yeah you don't like it you don't like the traffic getting out you  don't like anything about it right those yeah long island's terrible um the the fucking uh it was  interesting though meeting everybody's uh people that was fun their peeps that was a good one a lot 
[03:17:00]  of you had a lot of representation at uh yes the girlfriend's parents were there bob kelly said that  uh lindsey fought lindsey's father looks like a retired superhero he's a good looking guy like when  he likes to you know he probably he has he has a lot of latent racism he's fought a lot of he's fought  black people his whole life but now he's trying to just get over it he's a guy he's a guy you should  never mess with he could get he could get some things done it seems like that's what i'm saying 
[03:17:30]  he could get some things done yes he's just one of those guys that size you up touch your shoulders  and see how strong you are and all kind of shit he's a he's a good guy and he's uh he's a gypsy  is he why he just he just has this weird luck in casinos strange weird luck yeah he's sitting next  to me i'm telling him i'm teaching him three card i'm like look here's the deal with three card you just  got to grind out hands don't make crazy bets make the same bet for the most part every single time  grind out hands and hope you hit 30 to one or 40 to one and then walk so he's sitting there grinding 
[03:18:00]  out hands with me i'm up uh you know four or five hundred dollars and i don't bet like anthony i'm just  having a little fun and he's doing the same thing and then he hits 34 he gets three of a kind  nice it just perfectly played out it was cool my stupid table had uh 30 to one 30 to one 40 to one  in uh in in an hour and you never happens you paid for it all right and that never happens in three 
[03:18:30]  card i mean yeah that's odd because in another three card session we played for three hours not  one 30 to one came in or 40 to one well the weird thing is all the cards come out in a row  it's not dealt regularly it's like yeah one two three for you one two three for you and that's  the weird part because the odds are being shuffled and getting like a straight flush yeah if you get  a regular straight what is it six to one yeah and then it jumps up to and then there's nothing no  odds in between it goes six to one and then 30 to one then 40 to one he hit and you can't survive  just getting you can't survive just getting six to ones every once in a while you're that's how they 
[03:19:00]  get you a lot of people say three cards a sucker game but if you could grind out hands and get one  big hand you should just walk i enjoyed it it was very fun it was less serious oh yeah you play  one of my things i don't like that that serious shit motherfuckers get all after a while it gets  all creepy and quiet and that's how anthony likes it at the end of the show you know at the end of  the show i walk over i'm like hey you know end of the show and you're just like like growling like  quasimodo i'm all serious yeah keith is sitting there like why can't we just go somewhere i was  working we were missing you at the three card table because you made a fun of vegas because you just 
[03:19:30]  start pointing and laughing at the deal you're like you're like seconds away from getting kicked  out of uh the casino that's why we love hanging out with you i'm very careful about just like in  airports i just i know how to be an asshole 97 right just don't crank it up to the yeah to the point  where they throw you out you can point at them you can laugh at me call them bad luck i watch white  guys curse like pit bosses out call them you muttonhead motherfucker you bringing me bad luck  and there's nothing they could say about that it's not there's nothing they could say if you 
[03:20:00]  call them a dick you know yeah it was it was it was it was cool man your in-laws are cool man i like  that i like your little crew and your long island he was represented oh yeah i had my long island  buds and my brother and it's cool to meet people's families yeah you know they come to the shows can we  go to your barbecue now that we had a little thing now no my mother's gonna be i don't want to meet  why i would love to talk to your mother she'll be she'll be uh she'll be putting back the uh

[03:21:30]  of wonderment in my head  that explains a lot  a wink of love to my mother  you too kiddo  that explains the glass dildos  no the glass dildos come from  from lack of uh  connection with other humans  thank you jimmy  secretly hoping the glass dildo breaks off  i didn't i didn't formulate at the right pussy year time 
[03:22:00]  like my my high school  oh is that what happened  like the when college and you know where you get most of your pussy  didn't get it  so i took when i turned like 28  that's when i started getting my pussy and started exploring  so that's where  fucking dildos came  that was your idea of exploring  let me get this fucking uh hot formed sand and stick it in your twat  that's exploring  you know exploring is a little spanking  sometimes it's fucking  sometimes it's very very  sensual 
[03:22:30]  those those fucking things  is it  i traveled with you  i watched him  it's different  with a  for squares  than it is for  for professionals  in a detus bag  the fucking  the same way like athletes travel with cleats  yeah  and fucking sweatpants  cause we are in a third world country  but you're gonna get that through security  did they check it out  i put it in my  in my uh  in the plane bag  i picture him opening up like  device angels  with like his tools  i'm very  i was very giving over there man  i bring costumes  and and and things 
[03:23:00]  i was  i was very giving  but it was just like  cause i couldn't pop the  the viagra like these guys  man i'm hanging with guys that  this fucker was  had a passive spitzer full of viagra  a hundred milligrams a night  my head was  i had a headache  and fucking  i couldn't breathe  tunnel vision  i couldn't breathe  everything was had blue tinge on it  and i was fucking  three chicks a night  and i couldn't come  it was as big as a car  he would walk in  and just be  his giant pink balls  just would be popping out  full of blood  but my heart  couldn't take that 
[03:23:30]  i can't pop viagra  so i had to  have fun  and i couldn't fuck  every day  and  wait wait  why can't you take the viagra  yes it'll blow you  explode your heart  what  because of the diabetes  or  because i'm  a fat guy  and i'm almost 40  and you're not supposed to be  popping something  that takes blood  from everywhere else  and puts it in your dick  it increases your blood pressure  and like  i understand that  but the old guys  are doing like  the old guys  because that's the fucking thing  like they say  guys start working out 
[03:24:00]  like when  when they get  if they get high blood pressure  or diabetes  or whatever  affects your dick  that's when they start to work out  once your dick is affected  then people  that's all guys  give a fuck about  and the prostate thing too  affects your dick  so when guys start  their dick's getting affected  they're like all bets are off  i'm popping pills  fuck my heart  fuck my  my blood pressure  my life  i'm gonna pop a pill  and explode my heart  just so my dick will stay hard  and that's true  viagra doesn't blow your heart apart  i have a good heart  not anymore 
[03:24:30]  uh oh  that's what i'm saying  uh oh  look at your body  it needs all the blood  everywhere  have they said anything  about viagra  being bad like that  it'll blow your heart up  if you  do you  anytime a motherfucker says  if your dick stays hard  for six hours or more  niggas  go to the hospital  get in the ambulance  and go see somebody  you know how much pressure  you gotta be pumping  through your body  that's what i'm saying  for a day  day and a half  a fake stimulation  so your dick can't  stop being hard  it's not even attached  to your mind anymore 
[03:25:00]  the dick being hard  is actually a side effect  that they learned  it was something  for your heart  i think viagra  or something  was made for  it was for something else  yeah  the guy emt know  for your head  what  i was like  always to grow hair  he said rogaine  okay but it's not bad  for you  i've asked doctor  dude  no you  viagra was to grow hair  did it ever grow hair  yeah it grows hair  on your heart  all of a sudden  your heart looks  as moss on it  you guys  it's crazy  but i was hanging out 
[03:25:30]  with guys that was  popping that  and buying it  unprescribed  from a third world country  absolutely  absolutely  that's some gangster shit  i just bought some  glass dildos  i was  and costumes  i think that's a little  strange  that's but that's  i gotta call them  like i see them  you think that's less  crazy than popping  third world viagra  you brought your own  costumes  for them  what kind of costumes  little  dress them up  they love them  like what  like what  like little like  victoria's secret numbers 
[03:26:00]  or like  some real draws dude  not no fucking  not that  cause they walk around  on the beach  with panties on a stick  like a lady  will just have a stick  and they'll just have  panties on it  and they'll buy them  i had uh  i would buy real  i'll bring them  some real  you know  american-eyed shit  yeah  did you ever  matter of fact  i came back  three times  and they  they would wear  my shit  that i brought  them  really  how do you know  the uh  the sizes  of the women  or you're just  picking out sizes  of what you like  well you don't get  underwear  you get  you get  the suits  the outfits  yeah from  from 
[03:26:30]  it fits  size  such and such  and such  and such  yeah  and then you just  alright let's get  some uh  viagra info out  for people  let's go to  scott and  jesus patrice  and ask how old  they are too  when they do  look man  i'll be honest  the phones have  been very light  today  people getting  ready for the  fourth of july  weekend  you talk about  hearts exploding  because of viagra  tell me more  tell me more  emergency  i'm about to take  one  you're not supposed  to be fucking  around  you gotta be in  tremendous health  to be taking  viagra  we got some  people freaked  out so let's  get some info  out there  scott what's up 
[03:27:00]  what's up boys  god damn  patrice i love you  but um  the viagra  sias levitra  the whole class  has vasoprotective  properties  it's a vasodilator  so they're actually  finding that  those drugs  are really good  for your whole  vasculature system  in fact viagra  just got an  indication for  pulmonary hypertension  so they're actually  it's actually good  for your whole body  to dilate  where a constrictor  causes you know  high blood pressure  and bad things  to the body  dilate  that's what i was  thinking  you don't think 
[03:27:30]  that anything  that that drastically  see you gotta  understand  that's not  something  that's slow  see when you're  on high blood  pressure medicine  and shit like that  it slowly  is getting your  body used to  something  you pop a viagra  immediately  your organs  open up  dad you think  that's fucking  good for you  where right away  your god damn  carotid artery  opens up  right a fucking  way  yes  ah you can tear  it  just  like it 
[03:28:00]  instead of  slowly  developing  a blood flow  it just goes  hey motherfucker  i'm open  now i'm closed  now i'm open  that's your heart  fucking pumping  and working dude  can dr steve call in  we are dr steve  i trust his opinion  he's a very knowledgeable  guy this guy seemed  like you know  what he was talking  about though  but that's a guy  he sounds  hold on we got  a lot more calls  let's go to mike  in jersey mike  mike  yeah what's up  i love you  and i love the show  uh patrice  viagra  that guy was wrong 
[03:28:30]  viagra lowers  your blood pressure  so that's why  it's dangerous  for people  that already  have hypotension  you take viagra  cialis  if you take  too much of it  your blood pressure  can drop  unexpectedly  the whole erections  for longer than  four hours  has nothing to do  with your heart  that's just simply  about the mechanics  of how you keep  your erection  your valves  thank you  you have valves  in your cock  and then they  they fill up with  blood and the valves  shut  and then if the valves  don't open  that's when you get  that heart on  that lasts for a while 
[03:29:00]  you don't think there's something  wrong with having a heart  but i don't know if viagra  does that  and you're not turned on  or just keep that shit pumping  i just got a text  from a doctor  i said  does viagra  fuck your heart up  and this doctor  said he goes  shouldn't  why do you ask  people with heart disease  shouldn't take it  but no evidence  it causes that  and i'm  i'm fucking  like i'm diabetic  oh heart disease  that's what i said  you should be  a healthy  healthy person  to put that  in your body  to keep your dick hard  but then again  if your dick  doesn't get hard  you're not a  completely healthy person 
[03:29:30]  then there's a problem  somewhere  it could be mental too  oh that's true  impotence  what  what's your problem  i don't have any problems  why you take viagra  i don't take it now  why not right now  the second that we're on the radio  you want to have fucked  three different women  within like ten minutes  i only take it  like if i know  i'm gonna be on a date  with someone i don't know  and i want my cock  just to rise  to be impressive  in my jeans  like if i wanna go  go ahead  just look at it  in the cab  look at the bulge  babe  and they think  this guy's a fucking man  ignoring his packing though 
[03:30:00]  he pulled it out  one day  when we went there  and eat this package  we went over this yesterday  if you're gonna be  norton's friend  you're gonna see him  like naked  you're gonna see  pretty much everything  he has  oh yeah  and we casually  talked about it yesterday  people were like  oh that means  you're gay  you're gay  it's like no  every single fucking  friend of jimmy's  has seen his penis  me and patrice  we're standing  in a fucking  in a whorehouse  in a third world country  and we're sipping  our diet cokes  and there's hookers  all over  and guys that speak  fucking portuguese  and we're both wearing  robes that are too short  and my  i took a hundred milligrams 
[03:30:30]  my dick was tenting  and i'm not horny  we're just both  looking at my tenting dick  and laughing  it was a moment  when we both realized  we're getting prostitutes  for sixty dollars  and norton's dick  looks exactly like him  like you just go  why is norton just sit  and we would just sit there  but i'm telling you dude  that's why i fuck  to bring it back  that's why i bring  those things out  because i want to partake  every day  yeah  i'ma watch it man 
[03:31:00]  i love watching a girl  come i  my self esteem  i love to watch women  nut  it makes me feel good  about myself  so if i get a  if i got my machinery  and i can make a third world  hooker  attached with  by my detachment  yeah  with the con  with the dildos  and the vibrators  and shit like that  it turns me to fuck on  when they really nut  makes me feel good  they fuck seven guys a day  did you ever like  buy one  like you said  you buy them like  outfits 
[03:31:30]  or you get them outfits  and they put them on  and stuff like that  did you ever like  as you're leaving  or she's leaving  think like  i'm gonna miss her  like i'm kinda  like  not like  oh i'm in love  with that girl  but i'm kinda  feeling something for her  this is what changed  my life about the place  i'm  i'm  haven't gone back  in a year  it's close to two years now  but  the thing that changed  my life about it  is the  the way  they devise  a way to make you feel  like they like you  and you  don't treat them  like whores  they 
[03:32:00]  it's something about it  that when i first went  it was like  butterflies  you just go  i gotta get back  right away  paradise  i went and went  back in two months  i had to go back  and then  what i started  realizing something  is where  like everything  kind of  got in my head  about wow  this is amazing  i would be in a  nightclub  full of whores  and they would  look at you  and  and i felt like  what a woman  in a  in a  a regular woman  feels like having  a pussy  my money was my 
[03:32:30]  pussy  so the girls  would be looking  at me  and i'll be  trying not to  catch eye contact  with them  because i'm like  oh can you leave  me alone  i'm just enjoying  my dancing  i felt like  how bitches  feel in the club  when guys are  looking  and they don't  want to get eye  contact because  they don't want  to come over  have you come  over and  so i had to  say holy shit  i had to get  that out of my  fucking head  and learn how  to really just  enjoy a  fucking world  full of hookers  not get hung up  on that they're  liking you  and they would 
[03:33:00]  be act jealous  and then i would  just start going  wait a minute  bitch this  ain't free  i'd be like  if you give it  to me for free  you could be my  girlfriend for the  whole week  and she's like  no and i said  well shut up  both you bitches  here's 50 bucks  and you both  come back  you sit in the  chair while i  dildo this one  keep your jealousy  shit at home  watching him open  his robe  we were standing  in the bar  and he fucking  jesus with that  laugh  he's got a  robot  i'm looking at 
[03:33:30]  his fucking face  and opie's like  good god almighty  does it do you  relate to this at  all  nah  is there any  fuck them  traveling to a  third world country  just do you  relate to any  filth at all  partaking in any  fucking dirt  baggishness  not in the way  you guys do  i mean  what is your  dirt baggery  man  what is it  it's a hell of a  lot more normal  than yours  without without  having a girlfriend 
[03:34:00]  all that just your  personal shit  what's some dirty  shit what's your  dirty shit  you you keep  sharing  you motherfucker  i ain't playing  your game  it ain't no game  i'm playing  i'm just telling  you what i did  you oh  honestly the  the whole hooker  thing with me  never i'd never  felt that ever  yeah but brazil  ever i'm not a  big hooker guy  ever  like paying for  paying for sex  that whole thing  i don't get it  watching him open  his robe and  fucking watch one  of the hottest  girls i've ever 
[03:34:30]  seen little  little girl  braces that was  dancing  yeah oh  and he opens  his robe and  he puts his arm  around her and  she just starts  sucking his  nipple  it was  beautiful and  repugnant at  the same time  it was violating  on some level  and she's just  got one arm  around one  and one arm  around the  it was just  like this is  what an emperor  feels like  this is what  it's like  it really is  like being  it's like  being the  king of rome  it really was  all right patrice  i'm back in  this is this is 
[03:35:00]  my problem  like uh  that's why  i i get uh  kind of turned  off by strip clubs  i i i i'm not  into the whole  uh i'm gonna  make believe  i i i like  you  i i i'm not  into the uh  i'm gonna make  believe that i  want to have  sex with you  you know what i  mean  yeah there's  something mentally  about that that  takes me right  out of the game  like if i have  to pay for the  sex i'm like  she's she's doing  it because she's  trying to make  some cash  like the strip  clubs with the  lap dances i'm  like oh this  girl could give  a flying fuck  about me  but it's the  same thing 
[03:35:30]  and i'm not  saying that's  normal but  that's what  that takes me  out of the game  i understand  that but  like say  i i mean  it's a much  more of a  turn on for  me if if  the girl wants  me some real  square  some real shit  but see i get  but i can't go  with that fake  shit like knowing  that the only  reason she's  doing it is  because of the  money but  here's why i  give here's what  the great thing  is you give  them see i  don't play around  with the money  like i don't  play with the  i i know what  it is so i  give them the  money it's almost  like if you want 
[03:36:00]  to have sex with a  girl right away  and she fucks  you right away  you she's  giving you  essentially what  a guy wants  and then she  can now explore  something else  i'd give her  the money now  she don't have  nothing else to  do but be real  because i like to  talk and and i  like to be bigger  than the money  that's what i'll i  like to be fucking  a bitch go this  motherfucker's cool  i'm gonna take his  his goofy money  but at the at the  same point i'm a  this chick's gonna  fuck i'm better  than than the

[03:37:00]  whole like paying  for sex i it's not a  turn-on uh to me  but you've you have  you ever in your  life gotten pussy that  you didn't invest in  monetarily besides  that old gag but i'm  talking about an old  gag you take it out for  dinner you give her  time you give her  talking you give her  everything else opie and  then the bitch still  may or may not like  you at least you can  get what you want out  of your it's a fucking  at least making a deal  an honest exchange  yes  now we're in 
[03:37:30]  different worlds what  can i tell you  what if what if the  money that you're  spending uh why does  it always have to be  some kind of down  payment for pussy  it is what it is  but what if it's you're  hanging out uh you  having a good  you're having a good  time  who the fuck  likes hanging with a  girl that's not  that till you wait  you're a caveman  but you're a caveman  till you are with her 
[03:38:00]  i'm not thinking  platonic relationship  eventually you're  fucking but what  about uh the beginning  phases or something  your uh relationship  maybe friends that are  turning into fucking  fuckmates and you're  spending money but  you're having a good  time you're hanging  out not watching the  game or doing any shit  like that  i'd rather pay for a  hooker and then hang  with keith and laugh  that that's i'm  i'm not you know  that's how you guys  think i respect that  but i've never got on  a date and it just was  cool to be on a date 
[03:38:30]  with someone or you  were frustrated because  you weren't getting  sex at the end of it  i don't here's what i  don't like and i and  i'm very honest with  it if i'm hanging out  with a girl i don't  like can't fucking i  don't mind not fucking  i don't mind i don't  like we can't i don't  like a bitch putting a  stipulation on fucking  like making fucking  more important than my  time or this or this  food like i asked the  girl i said look i  said look let's mess  around a little bit we  attracted to each other  she said well i don't  really have casual  sex so i said well i  don't really have casual  conversations bitch so 
[03:39:00]  why is your casual my  casualness less important  than your casualness it's  not that's what i'm  saying that shit is not  caveman oh no no  honest how many bitches  do you hang out with i'll  be honest with you and  you as funny as your  friends i've never gone out  on a date with a girl  where i didn't want to  fuck thank you it wasn't  like hey this is great you  know i'll see you again  maybe we'll go to the  theater next week maybe  we'll play i've wanted to  yeah you want to fuck but 
[03:39:30]  there have been nights  where you didn't fuck and  you did you had a good  time you did you didn't  fuck but you it was better  than can't fuck like she  didn't go she didn't go  listen i don't you know i  don't know what this is  about give you the speech  about how you're not  going to fuck right but  we never give a speech  about hey you're not  going to have dinner hey  listen uh i don't want  this to be about dinner  and movies i just want  this to be about you know  blah blah blah that's  what i'm saying it's like  it's not a caveman i  usually don't make the  move until it's a short 
[03:40:00]  thing like i'm a fucking  i'll be like on the  campaign trail and how  much i'll do some  investing and stuff but  i'll make sure it's a  short thing and then you  know you either got a  hole and drop them down  and and i'm not gonna i'm  not gonna invest if i know  i'm gonna get turned down  you either got hold on we  got a guy's gonna agree  with you and and and me  here uh don in vegas go  ahead yeah it'll be okay  so i'll be i can understand  what you're saying about  the hookers um you're like 
[03:40:30]  they're all out to get  cash and that's about it and  i had i actually had sex  with this crazy german bitch  over in uh in keel germany  and uh she was actually  telling me about her  boyfriend while i'm  nailing her and i was like  what the hell is this  so but when i went to  poland had sex with this  like three chicks in one  night like norton and uh  these chicks were crazy  and i would have taken all  them home but they were  polish chicks are very  sexy right  badass chicks too  yeah all right 
[03:41:00]  that was a story that kind  of stopped in the  yeah opie i'm into the  square thing like you see  i'm not in disagreement  with him i just my  philosophy about it is that  okay if i if if the game  is money if you are with  some hooker and she wants  money i give her money so  she don't have to worry  about thinking about it  because i equate how she  feels about money to how i  feel about pussy i really am  going to be thinking about  fair exchange  right my my behavior is 
[03:41:30]  always contingent not on  whether this bitch thinks  we're going to be friends  but whether or not she's  going to stay liking me  enough to fuck me that's  the relationship once the  money is laid out that  decision's made everything's  done she got what she  wants right now i can now  if you're having sex with a  woman and or if you're not  having sex with you're  waiting around sitting  around on some weird  behavior hoping that she  makes a decision and then 
[03:42:00]  what it is is they hold out  on it and they keep you  hostage and they do this  and do that so that maybe  they force you to like  them that's what i'm  saying it's a that's the  thing about it that's is  that's the part i i don't  like is the is that pussy  is fucking above really  sex is more important than  to a woman because it's  harder to satisfy a woman  than it is a guy we'll  stick our dick in any hole  and and basically go jerk  off fuck up fuck up 
[03:42:30]  cannula whatever the fuck  a guy do  but for a woman to have a  good orgasm that's a talent  that you have it's more  important that that our  sexual part of it is more  important than theirs yeah  that's what i'm trying to  be pretty much one moving  part yes when the women  need all kinds of gadgetry  being you know pulled and  manipulated  never bought pussy ever  nope  you never bought pussy i could  honestly say never never  bought pussy never went to 
[03:43:00]  but first of all back in  back in the day going to a  hooker meant uh some  fucking chick was gonna  spit a razor blade out and  slice your throat in some  back alley  like fucking fortapache the  bong  fucking pam grier  yeah pam grier was gonna  slice my throat or whatever  the fuck i didn't need that  shit this place was a fucking  shit hole  fortapache it wasn't like  walking into some nice place  and getting some nice broad  dude it's a high to pay for 
[03:43:30]  pussy i never did it's a high  to give somebody money it's  almost like whenever i have  money the most wonderful thing  to do with it is to somehow get  me laid with it so when i hand it  to a girl and just know if i  pull my cock out she'll just  suck it  it's so dirty and fucking sexy  to pull your dick out in front of  a girl like here's your money  just that doesn't do anything for  yo just the feeling of a mouth  on your dick just for a couple  of bucks  but let's say you can get that 
[03:44:00]  without the money  but then they don't just leave  after like answer like there's a  price to pay and it's your life  if a girl says i'm gonna suck  your dick and then amps gray how  do you feel about that no money  needed but i love it when they  have a driver who's waiting i  don't think this counts you know  they got places to be but i had a  sexcapade uh with a uh with a  stripper at a at a strip club  okay but i i didn't pay her for  it doesn't count like i you know i  was slipping it was like you know 
[03:44:30]  a few bucks here and there but then  when she was done uh we sat at the  bar and kind of hooked up that  doesn't count that's that wasn't  paying for sex but i'm you know  that's a coup actually okay that's a  great coup kevin from texas is at a  bachelor party that's great we've  heard this many times hookers don't  get paid to come they get paid to go  sometimes they do but sometimes you  want you there's a lot of people  agreeing with you patrice you know  i'm just i mean i'm just being i  know i'm not i'm not disagreeing  with you on that but there's a  there's a fucking animal side that 
[03:45:00]  i'm just trying to have a  conversation with the dude side and  like like every dude is hookers and  pimps that whole world is  interesting to everybody every guy  wants to know what it's like to be a  pimp other than smack a bitch in the  face and make her sell her pussy and  give you the money psychology it's  the manipulation of having enough  mouth game to say okay bitch you give  your pussy away uh for money and then  give it all to me it's an interesting  thing and then women are like always  going jesus some struggling beautiful 
[03:45:30]  woman out there is going i have an  asset that is is i'm not using for  what this shitty thing called dignity  and she wants to know what it's like to  sell pussy it's a it's such a a  primitive thing that we tap into there's  no way people don't think about it  can you get laid on your own what i'm  just asking on your own on my own yeah  yes but you don't want i'm amazing i  don't i it's just like sometimes like 
[03:46:00]  the first time me and my girl did a  threesome she was dancing around it  dancing around it and god bless the  fact that there was a puerto rican  girl out there that sells pussy and she's  a bisexual and i called her up and said  let's get my girl to open up in the  direction where she needs to  so bing bong coming in it's in her face  a trooper is born now we can go do the  square thing god bless women who want to  do that i don't want every woman to have 
[03:46:30]  fucking integrity and fuck up my life  that's why there's a goddamn place  called fantasy island that we call rio  de janeiro with the with a mixture of  every beautiful part of every woman  black woman's body white woman's  fucking eye color and hair puerto rican's  body color they're every chick that you  ever they're gorgeous and they sell  pussy for four dollars and 99 cent and  you go over there and you treat them 
[03:47:00]  like princesses and they treat you like  kings it's not hooker ho shit like like  the bitches that were here that time  like yeah $700 and then for an hour  these bitches pretend to be your  girlfriend all night they stay with you  because they live in a shack so they'll  stay in your hotel room so they can have  a nice shower and hang up it's a good  fake job right now there's planes backed  up on runways heading to fucking rio  good job patrice is doing a great  commercial they don't talk a lot  the tourism board down there sell you what  you want to buy and that's why i came 
[03:47:30]  from there when i traveled there my  mentality got harder because i'm like  all the chicks here have to do is sell  you what you are now i'm really  confused because uh like i i understood  what jimmy was saying like you get a  hooker you have you have sex with her  and then you go hang out with your  friends you're done with this person you  don't want to you don't want to hang  out with the girl unless you care for  them after you have sex so you want to  you want them gone but in your case  they're staying the whole night but i'm  also with him too  so you've had girls stay all night and 
[03:48:00]  you're like that i've actually fallen  in love with hookers here too it's  different highs yeah what yeah how old  are you in your somethings yeah okay  37 all right so look it i'm i've come to  this realization and this is this is it is  what it is 23 year old woman find me not  to be a sexual entity no more i no matter  how cool i try to be no matter how much i  try to iron my clothes when did they  when i was 22 when i was like a 22 year  old kid i was like but 37 they just i'm 
[03:48:30]  not you know they just i'm i'm  attractive to women my age they like me  but when you go to brazil it's a 23  year old that'll sit there with the  calmness and the and the seasoning of a  37 year old that'll sit there let you  just look at how beautiful she is with a  fucking blonde um hair from being tanned  and shit they're just gorgeous in those  green eyes and that beautiful skin and  they're sitting there drinking a coffee  and you're from everyone and we're all  sitting around laughing like this now  imagine a sexy 22 year old sitting right 
[03:49:00]  next to you every couple of seconds while  we're having a good time you just tap her  thigh and go good girl and she'll go and  drink a little coffee and you're like  hungry yes she's eating they'll be they  they tap into something that one day  maybe you'll know what it is i can't  explain it they just know how to tap into  something real fucking jurassic make you  feel wanted and sexy and comfortable he 
[03:49:30]  they make you feel like that's what it's  like to be brad pitt all the time to have  attractive women reacting to you that way  not feeling rushed not feeling like will they  fuck but you know they're gonna fuck you be  you know they'll stay or go whatever you  want all right so have you ever felt that  without the the hooker thing with just a  regular woman sexuality well if you fuck a  girl regular woman whatever like a girl  today right dude there's a price on your 
[03:50:00]  time it's rare it's only groupies will fuck you  right now and go thank you because they would  have to go this this is a groupie what a  groupie's thinking to herself is you know  what this guy his time is so much more  valuable than my pussy i'm just gonna give  it to him and i'm gonna leave he's more  valuable than me but some women think my  pussy is as valuable as this guy's entire  existence so i'm gonna fucking i'm gonna if  he fucks me i'm gonna get something out of 
[03:50:30]  this and the something the brazilian girls  will get sometimes is is some cash and you  don't give it to him like here's your  pussy you giving it to him like the bitch  lives in in a fucking hut on top of a hill  and she's she's letting a mess like me a  mess like him and a mess like the guys we  hang out with like be sexy and and what we  do for them is treat them with complete love  and i get mad because i want to stay here and  not fly 10 hours to treat women with that 
[03:51:00]  that degree of love when they don't  understand fucking you're selling it  anyway bitch here's a couple of dollars  now just act right right when are you  doing black philip again i did it a  couple weeks ago i'll do it probably in a  month or so all right yeah i mean this is  the type of thing patrice oh yeah on his  show shine it is very interesting  absolutely i'm not saying you're wrong i'm  just trying to i don't disagree with you  dude i like learning about other people's  world that's one of my things i love that  but you know i'm trying to understand yeah
