<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the usual chaotic banter, rife with crude sexual innuendo, and a discussion of potentially having Robin Leach as a guest.  Opie shared an embarrassing story about a bowel movement mishap.  The hosts then transitioned to complaining about their commutes, particularly the slow drivers they encountered in snowy conditions.  Technical difficulties with the studio equipment were attributed, jokingly, to possible sabotage by the nighttime staff.

A caller named Rob phoned in, recounting his luck (or lack thereof) in Atlantic City. He detailed winning at three-card monte, only to lose it all at blackjack, adding that he also attended a benefit for a fallen Philadelphia police officer's family.

A substantial segment of the show was dedicated to recounting a heated argument from the previous day involving Patrice, Danny, and the hosts. The argument began with Patrice's questionable online activity – downloading movies from potentially malicious websites – and rapidly devolved into a racially charged shouting match, punctuated by Jimmy's repetitive and irritating "ooh" interjections.

The conversation then shifted to *The Apprentice*, with the hosts criticizing Dice Clay's performance and expressing strong disdain for Melissa Rivers. This led to a broader discussion of Joan Rivers' career, contrasting her edgier style with Ryan Seacrest's more mainstream, "safe" approach. Opie briefly mentioned a poker game encounter with professional poker player Annie Duke.

The show concluded with brief mentions of several upcoming topics: a story about an NFL player, Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, the absurdity of breastfeeding while driving, and the recent death of radio personality Paul Harvey.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. & Anthony Show.  O.P. & Anthony.  Radio Shop Jocs.  O.P. & Anthony.  O.P. & Anthony.  Ask the question.  Ask the question, you're bombing.  Ask Ed.  How many miles of **** have been in you?  I'm excited to talk to Robin Leach.  Welcome to the O.P. & Anthony Show.  How are you?  Good morning to you.  What was the most expensive house you ever were in? 
[00:00:30]  You guys were so bad.  Yeah, you guys are really mean.  You guys were picking out the worst pictures you guys could find and putting them up there.  Like, seriously, like...  Stop.  Don't know.  Oh, what happened?  I knew it.  What is wrong?  You're sucking on a big black ****.  What's wrong with it?  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, my God. 
[00:01:00]  I just made it.  Yeah, you were in the can over there.  You might want to get some of that yellow tape.  Oh, really?  Crime tape?  Oh, boy.  The bathroom off?  I heard the promo, the intro to the O.P. & Anthony Show.  I'm like, I don't think I'm going to make it.  Oh, my God.  I'm debuting the hoodie, by the way.  No, is that the hoodie that had...  This is the first time I've worn the hoodie since the incident.  That's the...  Washed twice, dry cleaned, and got to wear it again today. 
[00:01:30]  I don't know.  I think you've got to just throw it away.  That smells good.  It was this sleeve right here.  I can see how the sleeve goes down the palm of your hand a bit.  That might have been a problem.  Yeah.  If you were listening, I don't know, a couple weeks ago, I had an incident.  An incident during the hygiene portion of a number two.  Yeah.  Completely surprised when my hand came up. 
[00:02:00]  I went, what is this?  Yeah.  What am I, four?  A little slippage.  How's everybody?  Very good.  Nice little snow day yesterday for a lot of people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was Winter Wonderland is what they call it.  Virtual Winter Wonderland.  Which means, you know, people constantly in my way.  Yeah.  On the drive in, drive out.  And today it was the same thing.  Some people just driving like 45 miles an hour. 
[00:02:30]  Like it's still snowing.  Yeah.  Because there's snow on the side of the road.  The expressway could not have been clearer.  Mm-hmm.  They, I mean, they, they got it down a complete asphalt.  There was no ice, no snow.  And people still left lane, 45 miles an hour, hazard lights on.  When you see that, you just want to throw a grenade through their window.  Yeah.  But, made it.  And there you go, 877-212-01A. 
[00:03:00]  Let me see if this works now, because for some reason, overnight, things just, you know how  it is in here.  Yeah.  Things stop working.  Like people, I think, just pick at things here at night.  They get bored and decide, let me just unplug things.  I'll just pull the camera out of the computer.  Yeah.  Things like that.  It's like, this was working when I left, you know, less than 24 hours ago.  Mm-hmm.  And now it doesn't work.  Could only mean someone effed with it. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And I just, I was saying, I'd love to have a closed circuit camera in here, hooked up  at home to my computer.  I'd watch it like a hawk till I came back in here.  That's a very good idea.  From the time I left, I'd just watch it and see, and just so I could go up to the person  and go, so you're the idiot that's been effing with everything.  Can I just ask you why you do it?  And then have them go, well, I'm miserable.  I don't know.  My hours got cut.  Just whatever it is.  And then just go, okay.  It's probably the jazz. 
[00:04:00]  I don't think they have live DJs anymore during the night.  I don't know.  That's the new thing in radio.  It's like, what is it called?  Automate.  Voice tracking.  We need to voice track.  I like that voice tracking.  That'll get the whole business healthy again.  Let's voice track.  Let's have the morning guy do about six hours, and then the rest of the day, we'll just voice  track.  Yeah, that'll do it.  Voice track.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, how are you, buddy?  Hey there, Rob.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, yeah, Opie, I know you said your father-in-law was like a down-to-earth guy. 
[00:04:30]  I was just curious if you and him were like reminiscing about the different girls you used to chase  in high school together.  My father-in-law celebrated the big 5-0.  And I had a fine little weekend in Philly, Atlantic City.  I was all over the joint.  I was telling Anthony, I played a little three-card.  Yeah.  And I'm not a gambler like Anthony, but if I'm down there, I'm going to have a little  fun.  And I was at like the $15 table.  If you know three-card, that means you're playing about $45 a hand. 
[00:05:00]  And I was able to get it up to like $600.  Nice, right?  Sure.  And then it was like 2 or 3 in the morning, and I decided to sit down at the blackjack  table.  I'm like, you know, this does very well for Anthony.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to play a little blackjack, and then I got visions of turning my $600 into a couple  thousand, which would be huge for me.  Sure.  That would be huge for me.  I'm not like, I'm not a high roller where I need to throw down thousands of dollars per  hand.  So I'm at this table, and I'm getting really tired, and I can't really focus.  Oh, that's bad, yeah.  I'm not really drinking these days, so it wasn't a drinking thing. 
[00:05:30]  And I think I messed up the whole table, because I decided not, I decided to, what did I decide  to do?  Uh-oh.  I think I decided not to hit when I was supposed to hit.  Oh, yeah.  That's what it was.  And there were people at my table, even though it was like a $50 table or something like that,  but they were playing for like thousands of dollars.  Yeah, yeah.  And I decided, I think I decided to stay on 13.  Yeah.  Let the dealer bust.  I learned that from Anthony.  Yeah, but what did the dealer have?  I think he turned over 13. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, no.  And he got the eight.  See, you got to hit that.  And the whole table looked at me and started yelling at me.  Yeah.  And there were a couple undesirables next to me, and I was like, oh my God, I'm going  to get the S kicked out of me, because I didn't hit on the 13.  Yeah, you got to hit that.  But they were very happy when I left losing all of my 600 within 20 minutes, probably less,  actually.  So you built up 600, and then it was just gone.  Yeah, and building it up with three car, that takes a while. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, it does, yeah.  It took a couple hours to get up to 600 with the three car, and then it took maybe, I think  it was less than 20 minutes, maybe 15 minutes to lose it all on blackjack, pissing off the  table as I went, as I went, where one lady just grabs her chips, all mad, just, I'm out  of here.  I can't play with this riffraff.  Right, mumbling under her breath, and then she walks to another table, like, ah!  And then we did the benefit on Sunday for the cop that was killed down there in Philly, 
[00:07:00]  and that went very well.  Over 3,000 people marched for his family.  What kind of benefit was it?  Well, for the cop that got shot and killed.  Or was it, ah, it was, ah, oh, no, no, no, I still gotta try to figure out one of those  down the road, but it was more like.  Like a vigil?  It was more like, no, you go to a bar, and you pay, what was it, like 30, 40, 50 dollars  a head, there's food, there's beer, there's door prizes, that type of thing.  But the whole neighborhood came out, and tons of cops.  That's cool.  And the widow, who's only like 23, 24, was there for like 45 minutes, and she couldn't 
[00:07:30]  handle it, she left.  I don't blame her.  But it was good, it was a good night for everybody.  Ah!  How you guys doing?  Alright.  Yeah?  Yeah, I held down the fort there yesterday.  Yeah.  With, you know, Patrice.  Uh-huh.  That was always, that's always fun.  Yeah, I didn't get to hear yesterday.  Patrice just yelling into the microphone.  Really?  Yeah.  And him and Danny got in a little spat. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Over some, uh, inane, um, computer issue.  Isn't that always the case?  Yeah, well, he wanted to, we were talking about, um, getting movies on the internet.  Right.  And how it's kind of easy these days to get first run movies that are, I mean, right in  the theater.  It's getting easier and easier.  You just pop it up and watch a movie.  Right.  You know.  Uh, so he had this site that he blurts out and it's like, you know, Z this slash dot 
[00:08:30]  TV dot this dot that.  And those have spyware written all over them.  You just know it.  Sometimes you see those website addresses and you go, oh, this.  This can't be good.  This is nothing but trouble.  This is just trouble.  I know exactly what you're saying.  Well, it has to be very neat.  www.something.com.  Yeah.  Ah!  Well, Danny, uh, decided, um, not a good idea.  This wasn't a good idea.  Yeah.  But I'll, I'll, I'll make it as short as I can because it went on for quite a while.  Uh, Danny said, you know, no, this, you know, this is going to screw up the computer and 
[00:09:00]  everything.  And Patrice just got all over his crap, all over him.  That was it.  And then for the next, well, like 40 minutes, I was, I was just getting the, the piss beat  out of me because, yeah, because I didn't want to click on this.  Because he didn't want to click on the link that would have just loaded up his computer  with spyware.  And Patrice is like, I do it at home all the time.  What are you talking about?  He goes, yeah, well, your computer at home must suck.  Yeah.  And then, and then it turned into, because I didn't want to, uh, you know, watching a  legal movie on a company computer that works, which I would like to continue to work. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  Then, uh, it was because I was white and I have problems.  I need to go ahead of him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  And then Patrice was bringing up white tricks.  It was this, yeah, there was a type of white tricks that were being played on him.  And then I, I, I told him that he was, he's gotten angrier since Obama's been president.  So have you though.  I know, but he said to me, he goes, he goes, and you haven't, I go, yeah, but I'm the guy  that has the reason.  I go, you're the guy that should be happy.  I'm the guy that has the reason.  I'm so, I'm tired of racism. 
[00:10:00]  I'm exhausted.  What?  I'm exhausted of the racism.  Why does that turn into a, like a, I don't know why it turned into race.  Yesterday was, was almost ridiculous with that because it seemed like almost everything  that, every topic that got brought up, he somehow managed to bring it around.  Right.  Well, it's because I'm black and you're white and white people.  Yeah.  White, white tricks.  That was the one.  And don't forget, uh, Jimmy throughout this whole thing, every time somebody had said something  He was just being an ass.  He was going, oh, ooh.  Real nice. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, he was going, oh, oh, ooh.  I'm sure Patrice appreciated that.  Ooh.  You've been friends with Patrice forever.  I'm sure he really appreciated that yesterday.  There's a couple of key points where you can really hear it.  It just kind of, it was just kind of nudging things along nicely.  Ooh, yeah.  It was really annoying.  It was this subliminal annoyance for people that were just going, yeah, someone's going,  ooh, yeah, I should be mad at this.  And it just perpetuated it.  It was definitely fun.  Someone's obsessed on instant feedback.  Yes, I know.  It's called a beef and beer in the Philly area.  Oh, is it? 
[00:11:00]  The community's down there.  They're very tight.  And when something happens, when someone's down on their luck, they throw beef and beer things  together for that person.  How about you stop shooting cops?  That's more than that.  Let's say someone is just down on their luck, had a rough stretch.  It's weird down there.  They're really tight and close.  I would say in my neighborhood, they weren't that close.  No.  If you got Efton in your job or in life in general, no one was there to help you.  No.  But some of these communities, especially in the Philly area, because I know about that, 
[00:11:30]  they just help each other out.  It's really bizarre.  Really bizarre, actually.  Because most of the people going there to help the person out doesn't have a lot of funds  or money.  No.  So.  But they all get together.  Right.  Did anyone see The Apprentice?  Please tell me you saw The Apprentice.  I have a DVR.  Please tell me.  Dice is the most self-destructive person I've ever met in my life.  All he had to do was play the game, and he would have been on The Apprentice for a few  weeks.  And what did he do? 
[00:12:00]  Well, it was a cupcake thing.  You didn't see this?  No, I have a DVR.  I think he's coming in tomorrow.  Is he?  Make sure you're watching.  Please.  Two teams making cupcakes.  And Dice is in the kitchen.  He's like, I don't want to make cupcakes.  And decides he needs to go do radio to promote the fact that his team's making cupcakes.  What?  Why?  And their team was such a disaster, but he should have been knocked off the show.  But he was just so useless that they had to throw him off. 
[00:12:30]  Like, what are you doing, Dice?  This is a huge gig for you.  All he had to do was like.  Like, just play the game a little.  There's a fine line between playing the game a little and being Dice.  Right.  You know?  Like, was he being too much like Dice?  Yeah.  And then at one point, he's trying to tell everyone that he's the biggest celebrity there.  And then he's getting into it with Donald Trump.  Sam, you saw this?  Yeah, the first thing he did on the show was complain to Donald Trump that there were  no bagels.  Yeah, no bagels and food for everybody, and that they were tired and hungry. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  He said, we need energy to do this, and there's no bagels.  Yeah.  So, I mean, the show was perfect for him.  Hey, Donnie, Donnie Trump.  Right.  Hey, look, it's Donnie Trump.  Donnie Trump.  Well, the classic, and you're Donnie Trump.  Donnie Trump.  And then it just got nothing, and he's sitting there staring.  But I think that was some clever editing.  It was very obvious they edited the hell out of that to make it look very awkward for everybody.  Why would they throw him off the first week? 
[00:13:30]  And, well, they're stupid for doing that, too, because there's a lot of just duds as far  as, you know, personalities go.  You want to see a disaster like that on the show.  I want Melissa Rivers to be run over by a New York City cab.  Yeah.  She is the worst.  Yeah.  Her mom, actually, the older I get, I think I'm becoming more of a Joan Rivers fan.  I used to hate her, too, but she tells it like it is.  She's had a career.  She sat in Johnny Carson's seat when Johnny decided that he was too hungover or whatever 
[00:14:00]  to do the show.  She had a career.  This Melissa Rivers, why is she famous?  Because she's Joan Rivers taller.  Exactly.  And I think Dice made a point about the umbilical cord.  Like, what's up with this one?  Why don't you do something on your own without doing everything with your mommy?  Yeah.  Right?  That's pretty good.  Yeah, he was good.  And I hate Melissa Rivers.  I don't know what she does, but she's famous, and she acts like she's, you know.  Yeah.  She's famous. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, all she's ever done is, like, done those red carpet things with her mommy.  Well, they f-ed up that gig.  Yeah.  It used to be on E.  Then it was on the TV Guide channel.  TV Guide channel.  Then it was on AOL.com.  And now it's like, I think it's on Pal Talk now.  Did they mess it up, or did he just drop it?  What?  Did he just drop that whole red carpet thing?  Yeah, because I think, oh, yeah.  Years ago.  I think Joan Rivers was just a little too outrageous for the network, you know.  They got Ryan Seacrest doing it now.  Yeah.  See?  Really?  Instead of her?  Yeah, very-  You know, you gotta go safe. 
[00:15:00]  Safe.  It's all good, clean fun.  Yeah, you gotta be safe with everything.  That way, with Ryan, you know you're getting fun, and it's entertaining all at the same time.  They deserve-  You know, those Hollywood fruits, they just, that's why they wanted Hugh Jackman and not  a comedian.  Right.  God forbid they have her just tearing everybody's throat out.  Yeah.  Just a bunch of babies.  Take no chances.  Don't insult or offend anybody.  Right.  Can one thing go by where there's a comedian hosting an event, or a comedian on a show,  or just some regular, you know, actor that maybe has a reputation for something, without 
[00:15:30]  an apology having to be given afterwards?  Yeah.  I don't even, there's always some apology that's gotta be given.  Oh, true.  Disgusted with it.  But now I'm hooked on this dumb apprentice.  I was watching because of the dice thing, he's off, but now I'm hooked.  Oh, yeah.  Do you know this poker player, Annie, uh, what?  Annie Dukes?  Annie Dukes, yeah.  What a C.  Yeah, she is.  She is a C.  I played at the same table with her in that LA competition. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, really?  And I beat her a hand.  Oh, nice.  And I said, uh, I said to her, um, I go, you know, I, I gotta tell you, it's a pleasure  to play with you, you know, play a hand with you like that.  And she just went like, uh-huh.  I gave me this chuckle, and I'm like, you know, I watch you on TV.  I didn't say this.  This was to myself now.  I was talking.  Right.  Because I have no balls.  Uh, you know, I watch you on TV.  It's very entertaining to be able to sit down with these superstars and play and actually  play a hand and beat her out in a hand was like a thrill. 
[00:16:30]  And she just looks at it like, eh, eh, eh, go F yourself then.  Annie Duke sucks.  She brought in a ton of money.  You see all the people that were coming up handing over checks.  Yeah, and the apprentice, she got all her poker player buds.  So they were like, you know, spending like $1,000 for awful cupcakes.  Both teams made awful cupcakes.  But you gotta watch for the dice thing, and he'll be in tomorrow.  Right?  Yep.  All right, we're just getting started.  And, uh, I'm just gonna throw this out there. 
[00:17:00]  Uh, Travis saw this show.  What's it called again?  I don't know if we should talk about it or not.  I'm just gonna say it and see if there's any interest.  How to be gay and covered up with a pregnant wife?  Wait, what?  What?  Oh, he's right here, though.  You know, it's United States of Tara.  Yes.  That show is twisted.  It's good.  If enough people, like, call about the show, maybe we'll talk about that for a few minutes.  We can talk about 24 if nobody calls about it.  Oh, God.  Enough with your man crush on Jack Bauer. 
[00:17:30]  You gotta do it.  He gets the job done.  Yeah.  Uh, United States of Tara, it's a woman.  She's got multiple personalities.  And she's trying to live, like, a normal life with her two kids and husband.  But, like, her other personalities show up when she's stressed out.  Ming, you're coming.  You're coming.  You're coming.  You're coming.  You're coming.  You're coming.  And it's really, really a creepy show.  Oh, yeah, she's pretty good.  I forget that.  You liked it?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah.  I don't know if I liked it.  It sounds like something that could be kind of cool to watch.  Yeah, it's a quick, you know, it's like a half-hour sitcom. 
[00:18:00]  She turns into a sitcom?  Yes.  I thought it was a reality show.  No.  Oh, no, no, no.  Is she not really crazy?  No.  No, no.  It's the chick from that Sunshine movie.  Tonya Letty.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, her.  Yeah, she was cool.  She was in here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But also, she turns into a 15-year-old teenager, and she's hanging out with her daughter, like  talking about how she's, like, trapped in this old body, and she's wearing, like, jeans 
[00:18:30]  where her G-string is popping out.  She's bending over to show basically her ass to her kid, like what two little teenage girls  would be doing with each other.  Yeah.  But she's the mom, and everyone has to just deal with it when she goes into these other  personalities.  Yeah, it's like, it's an adventure every week.  But one of the personalities is a dude.  Yeah, Buck.  Buck, who's, like, kind of like a union guy, kind of wears, like, the cutoff, like, shirt  and the trucker hat.  But is she doing a one-woman show for a sitcom? 
[00:19:00]  And now let me bring out this character.  But then Buck goes to school and beats the crap out of her daughter's boyfriend, because  the boyfriend was pushing the daughter around, so now, you know, the mom is now this dude  character and beats the crap out of him in front of everybody.  Buck's a Vietnam vet.  Oh, is he really?  Yeah.  Is that the personality that...  Oh, which is hilarious.  He loves guns, and they have a rule in the house when Buck shows up that they can only  go shooting as a family, because Buck really doesn't know how to shoot a gun. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, oh, okay.  Thinks he does, because it's a she.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  Whoa, is that her nude little top thing?  Yeah, wow, wonderful.  A little gravity.  Usually that's hot to see a woman topless.  Yeah.  She was pretty fat in that Muriel's wedding movie.  She was in that years ago.  Yeah.  I was forced to watch it, I swear.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  Yeah, the NFL player story is bizarre. 
[00:20:00]  We've got Madoff's going to piss off Jimmy a little more today.  Breastfeeding while driving, that could be a problem.  And Paul Harvey died, radio legend Paul Harvey, and we got his last broadcast?  Yeah.  He did this and then what, died like a couple days later or something?  No, it was a couple weeks.  A couple weeks?  No.  All right.  Lots to do.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Thank you. </pre>
