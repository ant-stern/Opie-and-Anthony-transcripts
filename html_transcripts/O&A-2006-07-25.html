<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of a substantial FCC fine resulting from a 2002 stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral. This segued into a conversation about Jim Norton's eyebrow grooming habits, followed by anecdotes about a charity golf tournament featuring celebrities like Boomer Esiason and interactions with past and present bosses, including Don Belucas and Tom Chiasano.  Opie detailed his current homelessness due to severe apartment damage—mice, cockroaches, flooding, mold, and culminating in discovering a significant amount of homeless urine in his air conditioning unit.  This was contrasted with the success of Opie's brother, a marine biologist, whose work was featured in a positive news article.  They also briefly mentioned Opie's other brothers, a chef and one working at Bear Stearns. The segment also touched upon a news story about a "retards in area" sign placed near a home, sparking a discussion about the offensive nature of the word "retard" and the challenges of parenting a developmentally delayed child.  Jim Norton then performed a drum solo before the hosts excitedly discussed positive early ratings from their Pittsburgh debut. The entire segment was punctuated by crude language and nonsensical banter.


The show continued with a deeper dive into the "retards in area" sign news story, featuring numerous offensive jokes and caller anecdotes, including one about giving "C-shots" to special education students.  Studio guest Steve C (in pirate attire) made a brief appearance.  Dennis Leary called in, promoting *Rescue Me*, discussing its cancellation by T-Mobile, and commenting on George Michael's arrest.  The segment concluded with discussion of *Clerks II* and an interview with Laura Kightlinger, promoting her show *The Minor Accomplishments of Jackie Woodman*, which involved numerous off-color comments and discussions about a disturbing scene in the show.


The next segment focused on Laura Kightlinger, with discussions of her show, its marketing, and her daughter's role. This transitioned into a recurring "midget sightings" bit, leading to further crude jokes and an extended, uncomfortable discussion for Kightlinger. The hosts then discussed their upcoming Worcester live show, ticket prices, and comedian lineup;  played audio clips from the Miss Universe broadcast, making crude jokes about the contestants and Carson Kressley;  mentioned a forthcoming two-person TV commercial excluding Jim Norton;  and addressed a female listener's unusual gratitude for Norton's frequent use of the C-word. A father and son called in, with the father discussing unusual 13th birthday gifts.  Various other tangents included discussions of *Snakes on a Plane*, a New York City street scene, and random street encounters.


The show then opened with a discussion about Lou Gehrig's disease and the myth surrounding Wally Pipp's headache.  A caller thanked them for a previous segment on nude photos of a female news helicopter reporter. The hosts introduced the term "buttery beat" and shared experiences with it.  A caller mentioned a neighbor's sign reading "Caution: Retards Reading."  The hosts then debated their invented list of the "25 Biggest Wusses Ever in Music," engaging in vulgar commentary.  A hidden camera story at a sperm bank was recounted.  The segment included graphic descriptions of a new sex act from a caller, further discussions of the "wussies" list, more calls, ticket sale updates for their upcoming show, and a "Fuck You" segment.  The segment concluded with a call from Bob Saget apologizing for missing a scheduled appearance due to illness.


The final segment featured Bob Saget as a guest.  They discussed a news story about Monique accusing United Airlines of racism. Saget detailed his flatulence issues, leading to jokes about bowel movements and Milton Berle’s advice.  The conversation touched upon the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Saget telling a racially insensitive joke. Saget discussed his career, including *Full House* (with a bathtub scene anecdote), his stand-up tour, his parents' health, his dating life, and graphic details of his sexual experiences involving prostitutes and unconventional sex acts.  The discussion included comparisons of Dustin Diamond's penis size to figure skaters', and Saget recounted a past *Entourage* appearance involving drug use and prostitution, revealing his preference for prostitutes due to a lack of emotional entanglement.  The hosts mentioned giving away OzFest tickets and concluded with sexual innuendos and crude jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  I've just been handed an urgent and horrifying news story and I need all of you to stop what you're doing and listen.  And it's Opie and Anthony and we're back live in New York.  Pay attention, they spark controversy.  Oh my god.  Being able to do the show we want to do.  Hold on tight kids.  One of the biggest fines in FCC history has slapped against Opie and Anthony.  You got a couple of great guides over there.  Opie and Anthony have cost their bosses a lot of money. 
[00:00:30]  Yay, bitch!  Hold a sexist stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral back in 2002.  We've learned our lesson, aren't we?  Yeah, we have. We've learned our lesson.  We're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks.  I would like to extend to you an invitation to the passport.  What's up, boys?  You know the Holocaust?  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for both people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls.  Bye.  What kind of sick mind operates like that? 
[00:01:00]  The Anthony Show.  So look what we do.  Are we ready to broadcast?  Affirmative.  That's radio talk.  My headphones are missing.  Yours are?  Yeah.  So now it sounds a little weird in the old headphone.  You get used to it in no time.  Wow.  Imus doesn't have his hat on. 
[00:01:30]  And his...  What age is it that you stop trimming your eyebrows?  When is it?  Because I know I get a stray little, you know, one that comes flying out and decides it's  going to grow 100% faster than the rest.  And you see it in the mirror and you clip it.  But then you just reach a point where it's like, I want caterpillars over each eyeball. 
[00:02:00]  That's how I want my look.  That pig right now, he should be helping Michael J. Fox into a galorium.  Jimmy's got the eyebrows that are long and they bug me.  I trim them.  Where?  No.  You're trimming finally?  You do trim.  Let me see.  You've trimmed your eyebrows, Jimmy.  Yeah, because Jimmy has one...  Spaggot.  No, they both fall over.  Jimmy has one or two, maybe three that pop way out.  Yeah.  And I've been meaning to tell him that it bugs me. 
[00:02:30]  And you really trimmed them yesterday?  Yeah.  How'd you do it without fear of you were going to, you know, maybe trim one too far?  I don't care if I trim one too far.  Yeah.  Just shave one off.  No, I just take scissors in the mirror.  I close one eye and I peek with the other and I go snip.  Is that it?  Snip, snip, snip.  Yeah.  You're a metrosexual.  I really am.  And I put some gel in my hair.  Because you did.  You had like three hairs that were flying up out of one.  Wait a minute.  Why?  You did not put gel in your hair.  No, I didn't.  Okay.  No.  And then my ex...  Because years ago, a girl I dated used to hate it. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Hated the fact that my eyebrows...  So I would always leave them just to annoy her.  She would like to trim them and I would always go, but it makes me look nutty.  And I would just make a nutty face.  Make a nutty sound and face.  She hated it.  Yeah.  She didn't think it was funny or cute.  It's not.  She hated it.  All right.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  These headphones are going to drive me nuts today.  I'll tell you right now.  Just make them louder, Opie.  Find me my headphones.  That's all you got to do.  All right.  And replay that intro so we can hear how awful it was like I had to. 
[00:03:30]  I know.  Yeah.  The intro wasn't that good, Steve.  It stunk.  I'm not a big fan of any more of the St. Pat's thing being included in that.  All right.  We get it.  We did that.  How long ago was it?  For God's sake, do we have to include it into...  Everything we do.  It's bad enough the news does.  We were saying that.  We said this in the past.  We could...  If for some reason Opie, me and you decide to get together one evening and come up with  the cure for AIDS, it would be on the front page of all the papers and it would go, 
[00:04:00]  cure for AIDS made by Opie and Anthony.  You might remember them as the Choc Chocs, Sex Stank Paths.  It's mentioned all the time.  Do we have to mention it anymore?  No, I don't think we have to.  I don't think so either.  That's like every intro I have mentioned in Nashville this coming week.  Who cares?  Nashville, right.  Be silly.  Jimmy, no.  See, I didn't even hear it enough because where is that going to be?  At Zaney's.  Zaney's, of course.  This weekend.  Very nice.  Where else would it be but Zaney's?  That's the type of guy I am.  It's not at Wackerrifics. 
[00:04:30]  Stupid comedy club names.  By the way, we got to apologize to Buffalo and all the other stations we started on yesterday.  Profusely apologize to every market we started in yesterday.  Yeah, we pretty much call in our radio show these days.  Talking about calling it in.  They got to hear a repeat, a rerun.  Yeah, there was a lot of excitement.  We were coming to some brand new cities yesterday and what were we doing?  We were playing golf.  We were playing golf as a tape ran of our show for you fine people in those various markets. 
[00:05:00]  But to defend ourselves, who the hell knew when we were starting?  That's right.  The deal was supposed to happen, I don't know, weeks ago.  Yeah.  You missed some good stuff.  We were raising money for a good cause yesterday.  Right.  The SIDS Foundation.  I guess they raised like a quarter million dollars yesterday or $300,000.  I think it was a little more than that, Opie.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  In the $300,000s.  It was a charity golf tournament, a charity slash celebrity golf tournament.  Yeah.  So Anthony and I go up to play some golf, you know, north of the city.  And I'm all excited, looking around.  Can't wait to see all the celebrities.  Celebs.  Can't wait to see all the celebrities.  Now, Opie, there were a few there.  Yeah, you and I.  Hey.  You and I. 
[00:06:00]  We're not celebrities.  I know we're not.  We sort of are, I guess, but not on that level.  I don't consider that.  Not on a level where you've got people paying tens of thousands of dollars to play golf.  Was Phil Simms there?  Was he?  Yeah, I think so.  Oh, I didn't see Phil Simms.  You guys didn't even know Phil Simms was there or not?  Well, it was a very big group.  We saw Boomer Esiason.  Boomer was there.  Boomer Esiason.  Me and Boomer spoke at the bar for a little while.  Talk about old times in East Islip.  Yeah.  It was pretty cool.  I told him any time he wants a little rematch, give me a call. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, well...  We had a little fight back in elementary school.  He kicked my ass.  I broke my arm, hitting him.  You punched him once and broke both bones in your arm.  Yeah.  The ulna and radius.  Two bones in your arm.  Well, the important thing is, can you still have children?  So, we played golf yesterday instead of doing our radio show.  So, welcome to Buffalo. 
[00:07:00]  And are we on in Portland, Maine today?  Are we on in Baton Rouge today?  We better be.  Are you hearing us for the first time?  You might want to call the radio show.  Give a call.  Damn it.  My foursome yesterday.  Yeah.  I had to play golf with, like, present bosses, old bosses, bosses that fired me, or us.  You were on the serious foursome.  It was very, very...  They seemed like they were very serious into their game. 
[00:07:30]  Well, I had to play golf with Tom Chiasano.  Tom Chiasano, who was very, very serious when it comes to his golf game.  I think his handicap's like four.  Yeah?  Oh, he just hits every shot perfect.  Of course he does.  Every shot is perfect.  He lines up perfect.  His shoulders are square to his feet and the ball.  Is the swing just ridiculous?  Like it's a...  No, it's just perfect.  Like you're watching the PGA Tour swing.  It's disgusting.  Yeah.  And then, I mean, I hit some good shots, and then I hack.  Then you had a few hacks.  Because I don't play anymore. 
[00:08:00]  I used to be all right.  But every shot, he just steps up to the ball just perfect.  Who's this?  All square.  Tom Chiasano.  Of course.  He's perfect.  With a tie.  Oh, yeah.  Just looking dapper.  Making it look easy.  He looks the part.  Is he good?  He's just perfect.  And from what I hear, there's like horror stories of people that have distracted him when he's  up at the tee box, when he's teeing off.  Like somebody had their hand in their pocket, and we're kind of just jiggling around the 
[00:08:30]  tees, pocket full of tees, and making like a little maybe sound.  While he's trying to...  Oh, he's trying to...  Tee off.  Tee off.  And he turns around, hey, hey, would you mind?  He gets all pissed off, and it was a big client.  Yeah.  We should tell people Tom Chiasano's the general manager here in New York.  Oh, he'll do anything to pull in a client.  Yeah.  This was one of the big wig clients, and he's yelling at him because he's making noise of  his change as he's trying to tee off with that perfect swing.  I don't know why I'm imitating Jimmy, but it just annoyed me yesterday. 
[00:09:00]  I was thinking about you.  I'm like, Jimmy would hate this, too.  I wonder if he brings a portable iron so he can straighten his ties on the fairway.  So he looks good.  Guy's nick neat.  He certainly is.  He's probably a serial killer.  He's sociopathically neat.  If you go through his pockets, you're going to find the licenses of murdered prostitutes.  That's a psychopath.  Just ridiculous.  The golf course was kind of out of the way, off the beaten path a little bit.  So he asked me if he could follow me to the Palisades Parkway so he knew where to get 
[00:09:30]  home because I have the navigation system in my vehicle.  I'm like, sure, no problem.  So I punch it in, and I'm goofing that, you know, you're going to have to follow my car  over here.  And I point to this Porsche, and it's like, ha-ha.  He starts laughing, ha-ha, and gets in it.  It's his.  Of course it is.  So I'm driving.  Now, I don't know.  It's a car for a perfect golfer.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Perfect.  It was beautiful.  So I don't know how Tom drives, right? 
[00:10:00]  So I'm kind of doing just a little over the speed limit through these side roads until  we get to the Palisades.  And the second we hit the on-ramp, a rocket ship passed me.  Really?  What a lunatic.  Really?  Dude, this guy took off about 100 miles an hour down the Palisades.  And I'm sitting there going, geez, great.  I could have been home a little earlier.  Because I'm driving all nice, figuring, you know, it's Tom.  He probably, you know, it's all show, you know, for the car and stuff. 
[00:10:30]  But he whipped around me and took off in that car like a rocket ship.  Do you picture him driving a Porsche?  No.  Well, kind of.  I picture him with 20 cars.  One whatever suits his mood or whatever he's wearing.  One for every day of the week.  What color's the Porsche?  Oh, it's black.  That's the only color to buy.  He goes, you know, you've got to love these cars.  He goes, the reason you get one is just to hear it when you start it. 
[00:11:00]  And he starts it and it's just that rumble of a Porsche.  The car's beautiful.  On a slap in his perfect head.  Is it a new or an older car?  A classic.  No, no.  No, it looks brand new.  Yeah.  So I must have tiny genitals and perfectly shaped and a perfect golf swing.  But I took some money on the on the putting green just before we teed off. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  These guys are putting up weasels his way in on a bet.  A weasel of my way on a bet.  I knew I could win.  I know I had no problem taking their money.  Yeah.  So these guys are putting.  I'm like, hey, what are you guys doing?  And they're like, yeah, hey, hey, guys.  They're like $5 a man.  First person to sink the putt, you know, gets all the money.  I'm like, oh, all right.  And they're like, you want in?  I'm like, yeah, sure.  By sink, you mean, you know, get in that hole.  Is that the object?  So it was only like a 10, 12-foot putt.  And they all miss it.  And we're just about to tee off. 
[00:12:00]  There's like five or six before me.  And I step up and I drain it.  I'm like, nice playing with you, fellas.  And I take all their money before we even started the day.  Sap.  And then I go to the first tee and I'm looking at my foursome.  And I knew I was playing with one of our current bosses, Tom Chiasano.  And I knew I was playing with one of our past bosses, Scott Herman.  Scott Herman was our boss over at WNEW.  And then all of a sudden, Eric Logan, our boss at XM, was supposed to join the foursome. 
[00:12:30]  But all hell broke loose in Washington yesterday.  So all of a sudden, there was a substitute.  And this guy walks up.  And I'm like, he kind of looks familiar.  He goes, Opie.  I'm like, yeah.  He goes, Don Belucas.  Don Belucas.  I'm like, oh, hi.  You're the guy who fired us for the mayor's prank in Boston.  When we got fired in 1998 from Boston Radio, because Opie came up with this great April Fool's gag that we should say that the mayor of Boston was killed. 
[00:13:00]  And he wasn't.  Huddle, huddle.  Give me those ribs.  Give me that unemployment check.  And yes, we were summarily removed from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  And it was done in the conference room of the Colonnade Hotel by Don Belucas.  He walked in.  He said, I'm sorry to meet under these circumstances, but I'm going to have to terminate your contract.  So we called him the Terminator ever since. 
[00:13:30]  And then we went to, I think, Daisy Buchanan's and decided to drink a lot of beer or something.  Yeah, sure.  But, yeah, to see him there, he walks up to me.  They introduce me, and everyone's laughing when they introduce me.  Hey, Anthony, look, your head's on Belucas.  Oh, right.  Yeah, they were saying that same crap to me, and I'm like, I looked around, because it was all executives and radio.  I mean, we knew everyone there.  And I just announced very loudly, I'm like, at least he had the balls to fire us face to face.  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:14:00]  And all of a sudden, everyone, like, kind of put their heads down and walked away like, well, I was one of those wimps that did it behind closed doors.  I was in that meeting, but it wasn't my responsibility.  I delegated that to another man.  Well, it's time to tee off, boys.  Oh, look at this.  Tea time.  Are you playing Titleist?  Boy, I think he's talking about me.  I was one of those wimps that passed the buck.  And then made believe I never knew him. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  A load of laughs.  Well, Don Belucas is certainly not the Terminator on a golf course.  Ooh.  He knows how to terminate golf balls into the woods.  Really?  That bad?  And even though we were on the same team, there were times I was finding his golf ball, and, oh, did I find it?  Squish.  You give it the old foot into the ground gag, make up for 1998. 
[00:15:00]  That's right.  Just a little payback.  Try hitting this one, Donnie boy.  I had to terminate your ball's contract.  Pick it up and heave it somewhere onto a highway.  But that's why we weren't here yesterday.  Yeah, we were golfing.  A charity event.  Congratulations to Joel Hollander and his brother and everybody else from the SIDS Foundation.  They made a lot of money.  They made some great dough yesterday.  So there you have it.  Absolutely.  Also saw Bo Deedle, who does Imus' show. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's an investigator.  Saw him as I was coming out of the locker room.  He was walking in.  I guess he was changing his shirt.  And, you know, I guess some people need to take a pistol with him when you're golfing.  I guess you need to be armed on a celebrity golf course or an executive charity golf course.  Why not?  You make your own hole.  Right in front of your ball every time.  You just fire into the green. 
[00:16:00]  I looked.  I'm like, why is he armed?  That must be great to just be armed everywhere you go.  So, stunned.  And didn't he say, you know, you never know?  Yeah, it's something like that.  One of those things, you know.  All right, so.  Must be nice, though.  By the way, Imus is going to be 66 on Sunday.  Wow.  66 what?  He was.  What?  He was.  Oh, he was?  What day are we up to?  What planetary years are we working on here?  Oh, I thought it said the 26th.  Today's Tuesday.  It's the 23rd. 
[00:16:30]  Are those Jupiter years?  I mean, 23rd was Sunday.  Come on, let's get real here.  Okay, I got it, I got it.  What, do you think he's older than 66?  I would put him at 70.  No, I would have said early 60s.  You figure he's been doing.  Stop it.  Broadcasting since what the.  When did he start?  The, like, 70s?  Late 60s.  Late 60s.  That's 40 years.  I think he.  Should have been in his late 20s.  That makes sense.  Yeah.  I think he starred in Cleveland, didn't he? 
[00:17:00]  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  He had, like, crazy ratings in Cleveland, and I don't know.  Whatever.  All right, we're just warming up.  We should take our first break.  We got lots to do today, man.  Lots to do today.  And I got to talk about my famous brother also making the newspaper.  Got a nice big piece of newsprint there.  Doing something useful with his life.  Unlike his older brother who just tells fart jokes. 
[00:17:30]  He's actually making a difference in society.  Making a difference.  We'll get into that.  We got to talk about Monique on the airplane.  We got to do some Tom Brokaw talking about global warming today.  The Miss Universe pageant.  The commentary was ridiculous.  What day was that?  On Saturday or Sunday?  We have logo audio.  Logo audio today.  Bravo.  Fantastic.  Fabulous.  We made the Daily Ten yesterday on E!  On the E!  Channel.  The Kevin Smith, Joel Siegel controversy.  We'll get into that next.  I got a homeless update. 
[00:18:00]  And that's me, of course.  I'm homeless right now.  That's no home.  What else?  What else?  Oh, family hangs caution retards in area sign.  That's some great stuff.  I don't even know what to begin with after the break, but we'll get into it.  Jimmy, you were saying, I'm sorry.  Nothing.  Was I?  He was saying, I'm sorry?  Oh, no, no, no.  I wasn't even.  I just noticed that.  But they brought me my, I wasn't.  Oatmeal?  I'm making it to myself.  My oatmeal and blueberries.  And there's pancake syrup on the top. 
[00:18:30]  I just want to know why he would bring me pancake syrup with oatmeal.  I'll talk to him in the break.  Okay.  All right.  Dismiss him with a fist.  Throw it at him.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hello, Buffalo.  I know I speak like an idiot.  Do you?  It's all about me.  Is it?  I was assaulted.  Were you?  We're brilliant broadcasters.  Are we?

What does he say?  That's the way his boss says it.  He says Worcester.  Worcester.  Worcester.

I'm looking at him, pal, like, no, he couldn't come to the golf tournament.  Joel Hollander actually said he's too busy kissing his new boss's ass to come down to the golf  tournament.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He's shaking his head in disgust because he knows it's true. 
[00:21:00]  We love Elo.  He's on PalTalk right now.  It's so nice to be able to watch your boss as you do your job.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I love Elo.  Stop.  Yeah.  He loves to drink.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He just, he just gave us a little screw you.  He held up an Oprah and Friends Launch Women's Initiative sign.  The only executive with one of those beer hats with a can of each.  Right, that's who.  But he doesn't wear it to be ironic. 
[00:21:30]  He really does wear it because he's thirsty.  He's brilliant at what he does, but he's a mess.  Let's be honest.  We love you, Elo.  All right.  Quickly, I got a homeless update.  Yeah.  Hope you've been without a home for a while.  I'm homeless.  I've been homeless for about two weeks now, I think.  No crap here.  I mean, you're without a home.  Right, right.  Everyone thinks we're living the life of luxury.  The life of Riley.  The life of Riley. 
[00:22:00]  I knew Jimmy was going to say that.  That's why I said the life of luxury.  Waiting for Jimmy to come up with his 1940s sayings.  That's wrong.  Riley leads a good life.  Did he?  Yeah.  I don't want to do the setup.  Someone else do the setup.  The basement.  Yeah.  It's breaking and water rushing in.  We live the life of Riley, but Opie, we're renting an apartment.  Upper West Side, which is a very nice area.  Highfalutin.  Highfalutin area.  Thank you, Jim.  And Opie had an apartment down there.  Let's just put it this way.  I live in a neighborhood where the lights will never go out. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  No blackouts there.  That's right.  I don't have to worry about blackouts.  I have to worry about blackouts.  No matter what context you're talking about.  Exactly.  The only time I have to worry about blackouts is when the whole city goes down.  Yeah.  But when it's like one grid here, one grid there.  You guys are top priority.  I'm lucky enough to be at this point in my life where I don't have to worry about losing  my lights.  But that's the area.  That's the area.  The apartment you live in is pretty much a crap hole. 
[00:23:00]  It used to be cool.  It used to be cool before it started falling apart.  See, if you have a landlord, though, that doesn't give a crap about the property, eventually  the place is going to start falling apart.  It's going to go to pot.  Right.  I had to replace an air conditioner, and I found out he's not going to reimburse me for the  air conditioner.  Because he says that when you rent a place, the air conditioners are not included.  What a scumbag. 
[00:23:30]  Then you say, okay, then I can take all the appliances with me when I leave.  So, yeah.  Is that it?  Is that the story?  Of course you can't.  That's why.  They're his.  He's supposed to replace them and do it.  That's what a landlord does.  But Opie's place, first it was overrun by mice.  I killed 33.  Which he got rid of.  33 kills in less than a year.  Right.  You're an ace.  And then cockroaches.  A few cockroaches.  One is enough.  Under a dozen.  Then the flooding in the basement started.  Where the wall broke from three feet up. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, three feet up, wall broke, water flooding, and then they found some mold, and Opie couldn't  live in the place because of the mold.  So, you're virtually homeless.  I went to my brother's over the weekend, back in a hotel last night.  But anyway, you guys are going to love this.  You're going to love this.  A new addition to the horror story that is Opie's apartment.  My stuff is still in the apartment.  You just got to burn it.  It's pretty much a storage facility here.  Burn all your stuff.  So, we go back to the apartment. 
[00:24:30]  I think it was Saturday morning to get some new clothes, repack, throw our dirty laundry  in the apartment, take some brand new clothes for the coming days.  And I'm starting to look at this front room, which is kind of a guest room, and I was really  tired, and I'm sick of hotels.  So, I'm thinking, you know, why don't we sleep in this room tonight?  I'm thinking.  Seriously.  I'm really thinking about it, okay?  And it has an AC unit in there and everything. 
[00:25:00]  The window unit?  Yeah.  Honestly, the front room I could possibly live in if I have to, but the problem is now that  the basement is out of play, all my stuff is upstairs, and you can't move around the  apartment.  That must be great.  And so, now the front room is just packed with stuff, too.  It's just a nightmare.  But I'm thinking, you know what?  Why don't we rearrange, and maybe we could crash here for a night, take a break in the  action.  We'll go back to hotels or living with family, you know, Sunday night or whatever. 
[00:25:30]  So, I turn on the AC unit, and we go and get a bite to eat.  And then we're going to come back, and we're going to possibly sleep in that room.  In a nice, cool room.  It's going to be nice and cold.  Yeah.  And I'm like, you know what?  We could deal with this for a night.  Who cares?  We're just tired.  We need to sleep, right?  And the bed's in fine shape.  Everything's washed and what have you.  So, make a long story short, we get back from dinner, and I'm like, as soon as we 
[00:26:00]  opened up the apartment door, I'm like, what is that smell?  And the front door is closed.  So, it's waffling from underneath the door.  We open the door.  You smelt it in the hallway before you even opened your door.  Well, as soon as I got into my apartment.  Yeah.  But the front room, the door's closed because the AC's on.  The smell's up.  To keep it nice and chilly.  The smell is obviously coming.  From your apartment.  From what?  From your apartment.  Yeah.  Coming from his room. 
[00:26:30]  Coming from the front room.  The only room left to sleep.  Oh, you haven't heard this yet.  No.  It's the only room left to sleep in.  It's the only.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Push comes to shove before this incident.  I was like, I could at least sleep in the front room if I had to.  Yeah.  If I really had to.  I opened the door.  I swear to you, it smelled worse than the subway.  Yeah.  Worse than the subway.  Like a subway where the homeless live.  Yeah.  Any kind of alcove in a building. 
[00:27:00]  The subway under bridges where a homeless person might live.  I was smelling urine.  Yep.  The unmistakable smell of homeless subway urine.  You know when you go down to a back alley and you have to take a leak?  Oh, yeah.  That smell where everyone else goes to take a leak.  So it's more than.  It's the smell that's been there for years and years and years. 
[00:27:30]  It's concentrated is what it is because the regular liquid evaporates away but leaves all that residue behind.  So the second any moisture gets on it, it's just like concentrated.  So wait, this is now on a ground floor.  Explain to me.  You live on a ground floor.  It's like where homeless people had probably been.  Yeah, ground floor and the front room.  Well, I mean, the regular listeners understand because I told the stories of the homeless people outside my window using the faucet to wash their heads. 
[00:28:00]  Even though the faucet is only six inches off the ground, they're sticking their head down there.  There's a little spigot outside your building.  Great.  And you hear them going through the garbage and all that crap.  So what they're also doing, apparently, is being jealous of somebody that has a home and a room.  Well, it's a brownstone, so you've got to step down off the sidewalk like a few steps and then into the building, right?  So it's a perfect area to step down, sometimes sleep there, but most likely it's a great place to relieve yourself. 
[00:28:30]  And that's what they've been doing in your air conditioning.  Well, it was obvious because I'm like, what the – I mean, the smell was so bad we were dry heaving.  It was ridiculous how bad it was, right?  So I go outside to check outside because, obviously, it's coming through the A.C. unit.  And the grill on the A.C. unit, another thing that the landlord has decided is okay when you're renting a place, you know, the grill is all ripped away and pretty much the A.C. unit is exposed.  And right there at the bottom of the A.C. unit is a nice big puddle of you-know-what. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, so a homeless guy staggered to my wall and my window, leaned his arm against the wall and relieved himself, and it ended up in the A.C.  In the A.C., which you turn on, and then it just blows the air into your room.  Yeah, yeah.  Wonderful.  The fact that you were even contemplating sleeping there is mind-boggling.  You can never sleep there again.  It's a cancer that place.  You keep going back.  The hotel.  My stuff is there.  We're getting stuff out.  We can get new stuff. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Leave everything.  I would never bring one thing from that place into a new place.  You're a bad packer.  You'll pack the last minute.  Like, as we're all waiting.  Oh, as we're waiting for a trip.  And you're also, like, you like to tiptoe into a new place.  One foot here, one foot there.  You don't like to just go, and you have to just go.  Leave.  There's hotels.  How can you be sick of hotels?  Like, they're clean and nice.  There's mold in the place.  You've got to stop with it.  You know what?  Sue this guy for the money.  Sue him.  He's a bum.  He's a mum-aloo.  Sue and Lindsay go out. 
[00:30:00]  You can't believe I am.  You find new clothes.  You go on a shopping spree.  A spree.  Get all new stuff.  Take your old stuff.  Leave it there and burn it.  It's time to start anew.  Yeah, exactly.  In celebration of us starting in Buffalo and Baton Rouge.  If the money's not rolling in from that, I don't know what it will roll in from.  I might be able to afford a hotel tonight.  And Portland, Maine.  Yeah, let's not forget Portland, Maine.  Don't forget.  And other stations, but no one from Citadel calls us back. 
[00:30:30]  So we might be on in other cities today, too.  Can we have a list, please?  Yeah, that's all we're asking for.  We'd love a list of the call letters and cities that the stations are that we're broadcasting.  If you're the PD and we're live in your city, could you please let us know?  Regardless of how angry you are.  So we could, yeah, at least we can promote you a little bit.  So that's my latest story about being homeless.  And then I look in the paper today, New York News Day, one of the big papers here in New 
[00:31:00]  York, obviously.  And I'm just, you know, thumbing through, you know, we're trying to show prep and make sure  we're on top of everything.  Sure.  And I see on, I don't know, like the fourth or fifth page, a really nice picture of my  brother.  Your brother's in the paper.  My brother Scott.  Now, he must be a jock somewhere else.  He must be a shock jock somewhere.  And he must have done something bad.  And he got kicked off the air or fined by the FCC.  It's your brother. 
[00:31:30]  It's got to be something like that.  What did he get busted for?  Yeah.  He must have gotten busted.  Was there something on his hard drive?  And I'm thinking, you know, a lot of Gary Glitter.  I'll tell you about this picture because it's been in Newsday a couple of times now.  You know, I come from a very big family and I've been in.  We've obviously been in the paper a lot.  Yeah.  I've never seen one newspaper article hanging from a fridge.  Never.  No.  But my brother's picture, this one right here, is pretty much on everyone's fridge. 
[00:32:00]  That's going to be the little insurance magnet, insurance company magnet holding it on.  You know why?  Because they could be proud of him.  It's not about someone being arrested or about being fired or being called shock jocks or being called awful.  I'm amazed at his job.  I'm amazed you have a brother that does this.  Yeah.  Because this is like a job that no one really has, only in the movies. 
[00:32:30]  He's making a difference.  He really is.  I think Kevin Costner is going to be playing him in a movie.  Doesn't it feel like it would be like a Kevin Costner?  Yes, and he'll fall in love with Rene Russo.  Rene Russo will play opposite him.  But there you go.  I mean, when I go to my brother's and my sister's houses and sometimes the aunts and uncles,  oh, they have no problem displaying my brother's picture on the refrigerator.  They're sick of your face being in the news. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  They're happy for him.  They don't want to hang your picture up.  They see you all the time on TV and in the news.  While you're conveying stories of urine in your air conditioner, what is your brother doing?  Yeah, while I'm thinking up the next fart joke, my brother's making a difference.  He's a marine biologist.  He's a marine biologist.  His brother, Opie's brother, is a marine biologist.  You have another brother?  Works at Bear Stearns.  I have another brother, a master chef. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  You talk about vaginas.  What are you and the marine biologist talking about?  Are you telling me, yeah, I saw a whale today.  I told her to take her top off.  Oh, my God.  They're all contributing.  Yeah, they're making a difference.  Jesus.  A marine biologist.  And there's a picture of him.  Did he go to marine biology school in the whole shmere? 
[00:34:00]  He went to the University of Guam.  Guam?  Guam.  As in that little island?  Yes.  He had to pick up and move to Guam.  You know where I went?  I went to SUNY Geneseo.  Voted one of the top drinking schools in America by Playboy magazine.  He goes to Guam to become a marine biologist.  Guam to become a marine biologist.  Yeah.  And ends up in the paper making a difference. 
[00:34:30]  What is he doing?  Lives in a really nice house out east.  Sure.  Four kids.  I live by the water.  And I'm dealing with homeless urine today.  And you don't have a place to live.  No.  That part of my brain doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  You know what you are?  You're the garbage juice of the family.  Yeah.  He's the liquid at the bottom of the garbage bag of the huge family.  So there's a picture of my brother being very serious on a boat somewhere.  Somewhere. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, he's out near Orient Point.  There you go.  Way out there on Long Island.  Marine biologist Scott Hughes seeds Halleck Bay near Orient Point with young scallops last year.  He's seeding the seabed with scallops.  He's bringing back the waters of Long Island.  The scallops that have been taken, I guess.  Are they taken for food?  Or maybe they've been lost to some type of disease?  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:35:30]  But what he's...  Yeah, Opie.  I don't know.  Opie, comment.  Your brother, Opie.  I don't know.  Opie.  He's making a difference.  But he's bringing back the waters.  They show him, like, standing on a boat.  Yeah.  And he's got this handful of scallops.  Young scallops.  And he's casting them out into the ocean.  He's freeing them.  Freeing them.  But look how serious he is.  Go on, free.  I would just dump him over the side of the boat.  He's like...  No, he knows what he's doing.  He's a marine biologist.  He's, like, seeding. 
[00:36:00]  He's seeding.  He's spraying them.  Right.  Making sure they cover a lot of distance.  Seeds.  He's a Billy Joel song.  Your brother is a Billy Joel song.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's helping the bay.  Making the waters better for future generations.  For the baymen.  So, who do we have sitting in a drum this week that we're going to dump crap on?  Anybody else?  A Long Island bayman caught...  Hold on.  There's a guy on the phone who wants a wasp to sting his genital area. 
[00:36:30]  As your brother is seeding the bay.  Yeah.  Making sure future generations will have scallops.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Marine biologist hues.  Not potty mouth hues.  Oh, boy.  So, the Long Island bayman cost 6,000 pounds of scallops last year.  Triple the haul of the previous year.  Oh.  And more than for any year since 1997.  Okay.  So, they're harvesting the scallops. 
[00:37:00]  One reason.  Because my brother is making a difference with his life.  Seeding.  What else does he do?  I don't know.  What else does a marine biologist brother do, Opie?  I don't know.  I think he's tracking whales today.  I don't know.  Is he doing something like that?  I don't know.  Putting a collar on a seal?  Right.  Washing some oil off a bird.  You're giving a pat to the seal's hindquarters.  Get back in there, little fella.  You get in there, fella.  We're going to track your migratory habits and make it better for you and your future generation. 
[00:37:30]  But you and yours.  So, there you go.  We turn on the radio and see what my brother's doing.  Yeah.  So, there you go.  To the Hughes.  Smack a rat.  Yeah.  To the Hughes family out there.  There you go.  There's a nice, wonderful little article you could hang on your refrigerator.  There isn't something in there that says that his mother must be some type of whore for having a child like this.  Remember that article?  Yeah.  When they called my mother and Opie's mother some type of whores to have animal offspring like the likes of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:38:00]  Didn't they suggest either you and I or our parents should be tarred and feathered?  Tarred and feathered.  We should have been euthanized.  Nothing like that in the marine biologist Hughes article?  Boy, where's that article hanging from the refrigerator?  Where's that proud little article?  Have we ever had a proud article that we could, like, hang?  Never.  The one time I thought I'd be proud and be able to show my mother a copy of Time magazine, which we had been in every smut publication there had been. 
[00:38:30]  Hustler, Penthouse, even did something with Playboy, which is, you know, a little classier.  But the fact of the matter is it's still, you know, naked women and at this point nude men, not something you want to show mom.  So Time magazine did a piece on the Opie and Anthony show.  I was so proud.  I'm like, Mom, this is great.  I'm going to be able to bring this over and you're going to be able to read a little thing about me in Time magazine.  I bring it over.  My one quote in there is how I was looking at a poster of Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen in our office. 
[00:39:00]  And I pointed out to the interviewer who the one goer who the goer was and who the prude was and how long we'd have to wait till they were of legal aid.  And you did it as a joke, like, like just goofing around, like this guy wrote it, warm it up.  It was Joel, uh, he's on all those dumb clip shows.  Yep.  They think he's just terrific for all those stupid clip shows. 
[00:39:30]  He stinks.  Talked about all kinds of stuff as far as the show went and radio.  And he chose that quote to put in.  And that was pretty much my only quote.  And the whole story was how Mary Kate and Ashley are hot.  And one's a goer and one's a prude and you could tell which one's the goer.  And I like went into it in too much detail, you know, like it's like he's got some kind of an issue here at detail.  Yeah.  And that was it.  So I could not show that to my mommy.  He just knew that those weren't like a random thing. 
[00:40:00]  You were picking out those were thoughts.  No, this is stuff I've been thinking about.  Right.  Yeah.  Sweating and blowing snot onto your upper lip without realizing it.  Yeah.  By yourself.  Yeah.  But there's marine biologist Hughes in the paper.  Well, proud little article.  And he's not only sprinkling little scallops.  One of them had a broken leg and he healed it.  A broken leg.  A broken leg.  That's right.  Scallops have little legs and they break easily.  See, Jimmy's little cast on it.  Jimmy's confused because we've described him as a scallop. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  All scallops have arms and legs.  No, Jimmy, just you.  I don't know.  And my brother looks serious and he looks proud.  He is.  Why shouldn't he be?  He's helping the world.  Every time there's a picture of us in the paper, there's that look of guilt.  They did something wrong.  Oops.  Oops.  Hey, let's say hi to Nick the Trucker.  What's up, Nick?  Hey, what's up, ONA and Jimmy?  Hey, Nick.  Hi, Nick.  Hi, Nick.  I hope you don't feel bad because there's always Brother Elmo. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  Yeah, you don't have to feel bad.  I'm on MySpace with him and just looking at that picture that he has on his MySpace page.  Yeah.  You'll never, ever have to worry about the retarded stepchild in the basement.  Well, go to my brother's MySpace account, Brother Elmo.  He's like the mayor of the O.P. and Anthony show.  He hangs out at FH Riley's every weekend and just hangs out with the fans.  Yeah, he's a great guy.  You guys take care.  I'm punching out.  And please, for the love of God, buy a T-shirt so I don't have to pay his bills, MyRadioStore.com. 
[00:41:30]  Please buy an O.P. and Anthony T-shirt so I don't have to pay his bills, MyRadioStore.com.  Thank you.  All right.  We should take a break.  Now I'm going to get the email from my brother.  Ouch.  He writes me every time I make fun of him.  Ouch.  That hurt, bro.  Right.  That one hurt.  Ouch.  How often do you see marine biologists, Brother?  My other brother, Elmo, by the way, Quick, he caught a trophy fish like last week. 
[00:42:00]  He caught a fluke that was ridiculous.  It was so big.  It's in the trophy fish category.  I don't even know.  I don't know crap about fishing.  Did it make the paper?  It might as well.  Did the other brother throw it back?  Right.  It might make the local paper because it's really a very large fluke and it's in the category  that qualifies it as a trophy fish or something like that.  So he's got no shirt on and he's fishing and he's holding up his fluke and he sends it around 
[00:42:30]  to the whole family.  You do that with your family, right?  Yeah.  Where everyone's just on email together.  And he's all proud of this trophy fish he caught.  I'm sure it'll be on MySpace if it's not there already.  And all we were commenting about was not the fish but his gut.  And how it looked like E.T.  Oh.  Distracting from the fish.  His belly looked like E.T. calling home.  Look at him now.  Isn't that bad? 
[00:43:00]  Oh, there it is.  Elmo's got a nice physique.  The Hughes all have good bodies, actually.  The Hughes.  What's the caption say?  What does it say?  Seriously.  How many pounds?  Because there's fishermen out there.  They'll be proud.  How much?  Eight pounds.  24 inches, eight pounds.  Oh, 24 inches, eight pounds.  Okay.  Well, yeah.  It doesn't weigh a lot because it's a pretty big fluke.  Because it's a flat fish.  But look at his gut.  It looks like E.T. calling home.  So you might want to go to Brother Elmo's MySpace page and just abuse him today. 
[00:43:30]  Brother Elmo.  All right.  We should take a break.  And we'll continue.  Enough babbling.  We'll get into some material.  What do you guys want to do next?  I would like to deal with the sign.  Yeah?  I think so.  Retard sign?  I think so.  All right.  Family hangs.  Caution.  Retards in area sign.  We'll do that next as my brother is saving freaking dolphins somewhere.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I gots the cheddar. 
[00:44:00]  I can pay to rank.  You are great, too.  All right.  Be a black guy.  Ooh, fun.  Call me daddy.  I'm your cheddar man.  All right.  Hope you like crap.  O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony.  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  We're back.  Back in the New York room. 
[00:44:30]  La, la, la, la, la.  Welcome back to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jim Norton, everybody.  Break it.  Jim Norton bringing us back.  Wow.  Amazing.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Yes.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Jim Norton playing the drums.  They're setting up for the New York Dolls, I think. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The New York Dolls will be performing on the Radio Chick Show later on this morning here in New York.  This afternoon, I believe, right?  Yeah.  I said later on this morning.  Yeah.  Later on this afternoon.  And they're setting up the equipment now for some reason.  So Jimmy has the toy with things.  And the drums.  Good.  And the drumsticks were laying out.  I mean, how stupid are these people?  Then you've got to play.  Of course.  And Jimmy, by the way, wow.  That was a great rendition.  Yeah.  A lot of people tell me.  I never played the drums before.  People just knew I could, though.  You know what?  You took the song and you made it your own. 
[00:45:30]  Absolutely.  Which a lot of people don't do.  They could just play it like it is on the record.  But you turned that song around into something else completely different.  Yeah.  It was like an Ace Freely tune from the old Kiss Soul album.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It hit.  Yeah.  You got any others in you?  I do, actually.  I mean, I play a lot of...  All right.  We'll get it.  Sabbath is one of your favorite bands.  Sure.  I would love to hear if you were able to play any Sabbath.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  I do a lot of Sabbath.  Someone tells me the drumming would probably sound a lot like back in the New York crew. 
[00:46:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Well, I also do New York State of Mind.  And in New York.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Bring it down a little bit.  All right.  We'll do another one after the next break.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll bring us back in.  I mean, I'm going to show off.  Off the instant feedback.  Chris from Boston.  He's a faithful listener of the program.  Hey, guys.  Let me get this straight.  Opie's brother is Jacques Cousteau.  And Opie makes fun of retards in the air.  Yeah.  That pretty much sums it up right there.  Feels like Jacques Cousteau.  Also, before we move on to actual radio material, I want to say hi to Pittsburgh. 
[00:46:30]  Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh.  We are paying close attention to you guys.  Yes.  Very close attention to you guys.  The ratings came out yesterday while we were on the golf course.  And Blackberry's going off left and right.  And everyone running up to Anthony and I with their Blackberry's to show us the Pittsburgh ratings.  How are they?  Pittsburgh numbers.  Oh.  Pretty, pretty good.  Yep.  Pretty good, Jimmy.  Thank you, Pittsburgh.  Very nice, Pittsburgh.  So far, so good.  And we're paying attention to Pittsburgh because we were never heard in Pittsburgh. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  These are one of the markets that we were never in before.  The other ones, like, you know, Philly and Boston, we had been in.  So people are familiar with us.  Buffalo.  Yeah, but Pittsburgh.  Brand new.  Uncharted territory for the O&A show.  I always knew, because I had done Pittsburgh a few times, like, in the time we were off  and whatever, that if the show was ever on there, we would just, that's the mentality,  man.  They're like Philly.  They're just Jersey.  They're just animals.  I knew they would like this show.  I predict a virus tour in Pittsburgh pretty soon. 
[00:47:30]  I agree.  I think pretty soon.  It wouldn't be a bad idea.  It wouldn't be a bad idea.  All right.  Family Hanks, caution, retards, and area sign.  Now, why would you do this?  Opie?  Oh, you didn't?  Why would I do it?  I know.  I made it sound like that.  Why would you do this?  Oh.  Meaning the General Yu, you know.  Well, I think they did it because...  General Yu from the Chinese Army.  I can't talk without thinking something else this morning. 
[00:48:00]  I can't find this story either.  Well, we just got the audio clips, which are...  Oh, there it is.  ...which are good enough.  It's, uh...  Yeah, why did this family do this?  There was a conflict next door.  The kid is like...  How old is he?  12 or 13?  The poor little 13-year-old Colton.  Little Colton is developmentally delayed.  His mother says he's more like a 3-year-old in a 13-year-old's body.  That goes beyond delayed.  That's a little more than delayed. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, that's brick wall.  Yeah, what do you really get out of a 3-year-old when you're trying to talk to them?  Developmentally delayed.  If you're 13 and you have the brain of an 8 or 9-year-old...  Delayed.  You're a little behind.  A little delay.  If you're 13 and you have the brain of a 3-year-old, you're finished.  Yeah.  Delayed is one thing.  Not showing up for the event is another.  He's headed in the wrong direction.  I'm going to be late and I'm not showing up.  That's the difference.  This little 13-year-old Colton, his mother says he's like a 3-year-old. 
[00:49:00]  He looks normal, but once you start talking to him, you can see he has these problems.  That's one of these tricky type mentally damaged children.  They trick you sometimes.  You ever do that when you're a kid or you're just driving around or something and you ask,  Hey, how do you get to Main Street?  And the kid looks completely normal and then something comes out of their mouth.  You just go, oh boy.  And something like this.  Bay!  That's why you gotta love the waterheads. 
[00:49:30]  I'm like the Bay around here now.  Excuse me, which way to Elm Street?  I'm like the Bay around here now.  Okay, I'll be driving along.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mayor.  Now I'm forced to ask the black guy.  Thanks.  Could you tell me where I am?  We welcome you most eagerly.  Yeah, but that's not telling me where I am.  Silence, whippersnapper. 
[00:50:00]  Morons.  All right, here's the audio.  Morons.  Morons.  That's what my mom used to call him.  I'm sure she did.  Yeah.  That's pretty accurate.  Morons.  Geniuses would be silly.  That would be.  Here's the story, guys.  Oh, I'm not taking the sign down.  Last night was the first night of peace we've gotten along.  A cardboard sign hanging in a tree directed at a boy with developmental disabilities. 
[00:50:30]  And the boy's mother isn't happy.  This sign now that we feel is very discriminating towards my son.  The cardboard sign is hanging in a tree in the central Utah town of Nephi.  And it's also being denounced tonight by the advocates for the disabled.  Sam Penrod has the story.  Sam Penrod.  Sam Penrod.  That's a horrible name to have through school.  Little Penrod.  When he's in school.  That's his news name.  Here comes Penrod.  Yeah, his real name is Faggot Teeth. 
[00:51:00]  Change it to something less embarrassing.  And incidentally, this is the same sign that was hanging up in the Voss yard for a long time.  You gotta love the balls of the neighbors, though.  They hanged this sign in a tree.  Yeah, how bad could it have gotten?  But I heard something.  And they said, well, you know, good.  Last night was the first night we had a good night's sleep.  So apparently, yeah, there was a problem.  I don't know what the problem was.  Well, the waterhead is keeping everyone awake, obviously.  How?  He did something like, um, he assaulted the daughter. 
[00:51:30]  He threw rocks at him.  He did something like.  What's the sign gonna do that's gonna silence the kid?  I think maybe they feel.  They can't read.  Well, it's obviously for the parents of the kid.  And again, I'm not saying the guy's right, but I think he said that the parents aren't controlling the kid.  Yeah.  You know.  That could be a problem.  Maybe they should put a fence up or something.  I don't know.  Put a fence up.  I'm sure.  Have your kids wandering out of the yards?  How'd you put them in a dog run for God's sake?  Put a little leash on them.  By the way, this is the second greatest neighbor story ever. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  The first one was in Brooklyn where this guy, he painted a yellow brick road that led from the midget's house.  Midget's that lived next door.  Yellow pants.  Out to the street.  Out to the street.  And would sing, follow the yellow brick road to them every time they walked out of the house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Out the screen.  He'd have his lips pressed against the screen from the inside.  Yeah.  Follow the yellow brick road.  And they were black, so he would also throw racial epithets at them as he sang.  Yeah.  It was just, this guy was a horrific man.  It was one of the greatest neighbor stories ever, though. 
[00:52:30]  Whistle while you work.  Yeah.  As they're going off to work.  That guy's a classic.  He was a classic.  But this guy decided the sign was enough to remedy whatever the problem is.  I don't know.  Maybe they discuss it.  By the way, we don't like debating whether it's wrong or right.  We just like to find the humor in this stuff.  We just think it's funny.  So just bear with us, please.  How could you not think a yellow brick road outside a midget's house is not funny or whatever?  All right. 
[00:53:00]  Here's the rest of the audio of the retard sign story.  It's for the disabled.  Sam Penrod has the story.  Deanie and Keith, the boys' family noticed the sign pointed at their home on Wednesday night.  And tonight it is still there.  That's despite our visit to the neighbors who put it up.  And advocates for the disabled are outraged, calling it insensitive and in the same category as a racial slur.  Oh, boy.  Well...  Oh, the racial thing.  Is retard a racial slur?  Because it's retarded.  When something is retarded, it is being held back. 
[00:53:30]  It is being retarded.  You're right.  Technically...  Yeah, I'd have to say this one is.  Because it's almost like hanging a sign that says spooks around.  I mean, look, technically a spook is a ghost.  But everybody knows the racist meaning of that.  It's like...  Yeah, but no, no, no.  Let me put it this way.  If you were indeed living at a haunted house and you put a sign up that said spooks, please leave.  Of course you'd be insensitive and stupid if you didn't know it had another meaning like that. 
[00:54:00]  But if your intent was toward the ghosts and not maybe your lovely neighbors, you could actually argue that point.  This person, retarded, is focused toward the retarded boy.  Okay, how about this?  Whose brain is retarded.  How about this?  Jews around.  Uh-huh.  Jewish sign.  Say the Jewish neighborhood.  Like, Jews.  There's nothing wrong with saying Jews. 
[00:54:30]  No.  That's not a slur at all.  No.  If you have a sign in your yard because Jewish people moved in and said Jews around, the context is racist.  That would be considered very racist.  I like using Jew then.  Of course you do.  That's how it seems.  All right.  Hey, uh...  No.  And why would you want to get rid of a tribe of people that take care of their houses and lawns as well as the Jewish people do?  I wouldn't.  I love them as my neighbors.  Love the Jews.  Here we go.  More audio.  What the sign says.  And we find out a boy can't read. 
[00:55:00]  We tried to eat it.  Three-year-old.  It was a big piece of cardboard candy.  Look at that sign.  Yummy.  Yeah, no.  You're on your way.  Yummy.  You're a good guy.  Yeah, I am a good guy.  Yes, you are.  This is 13-year-old Colton Heaton, who is developmentally delayed.  His mother says he is more like a three-year-old.  He looks normal, but once you start talking to him, you can see that he has... 
[00:55:30]  He's a blithering idiot.  ...problems, and that he is just a loving little guy.  He thinks we're all just a great big family.  Of bears.  This cardboard is hanging in their neighbor's tree, spray-painted with the words,  Caution, retards, in area.  His mother says it's fortunate Colton can't read the words.  Oh, thank God he can't read it.  This neighbor's a classic.  The guy had to read it, too.  Caution, retards, in area.  What the news guy is saying is, thank God that's accurate.  This kid will be really offended. 
[00:56:00]  I don't like the way he's saying disabled.  Say he's mentally retarded.  That's what he is.  Yeah, let's go to Jimmy the trucker.  Jimmy.  Hey, how you doing?  Good, Jimmy.  This kid, what is he?  He's 13, but he acts like he's three.  I was just wondering, what's he like when he was three?  That's true.  Like a turnip lying on the floor with a blank chair.  He was like a spermatozoa.  Yeah, I was going to say zygote.  He just swam around the house.  Lay around on the floor, shaking his feet.  How old is he?  Well, he's three, but if you talk to him, you'd think he's minus seven. 
[00:56:30]  Meet my son.  He's a zygote.  All right, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Orlando from Jersey.  Hey, what's up, bro?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up there?  Listen, from what I heard on the radio boob show yesterday afternoon, supposedly this  kid was tormenting the neighbors, driving them crazy.  The parents went to, like, the cops.  They wouldn't do nothing for them.  They tried to go to city council. 
[00:57:00]  Nothing would happen.  So they finally put up this sign just to get the attention of the parents, see if they  would stop.  And now, all of a sudden, everybody's getting all offended.  What was the kid doing wrong?  I know he was doing...  Yeah, what was he doing that was so bad?  Well, he was apparently throwing rocks at the neighbor's kids, like, tormenting them, driving  them crazy, throwing them, making noise at all hours of the night, going through the  neighborhood.  Like, real weird stuff.  I mean, if the kid is supposedly acting like he's three years old or mentally able, like  three years old, kind of like Jimmy over there, why would you even...  Sir, there's no reason to hurt my feelings. 
[00:57:30]  I love you.  Okay.  All right.  See you.  Later, guys.  And by the way, Jimmy did...  He trimmed his eyebrows.  I did.  They looked too nutty before.  He's wacky, crazy.  All right.  What are you doing, solving a puzzle?  So this kid was driving the neighbor's...  Batty.  Batty.  But that's just something kids do, also.  I remember kids that weren't retarded used to throw rocks at other kids.  You'd have rock fights, things like that.  You'd pick up a rock and throw it at a kid. 
[00:58:00]  Or you'd make noises.  I used to live next door to a deaf family.  Oh, brother.  All you'd hear.  At all hours.  And they weren't even like...  Please tell me.  Please tell me they could hear just enough so they had to really yell.  They would sign to each other, but they would also mouth out the words.  You know?  But they didn't know that they were making noises.  So it would come out like...  At all hours, you'd hear this coming out of the house. 
[00:58:30]  And what are you going to do?  Hang a sign?  Deaf people next door making a racket?  Go!  You throw rocks at them.  That's right.  You don't do anything.  You deal with it.  They're your neighbors.  Maybe...  Did they try to confront the parents and say,  Excuse me.  Your son, I understand he has got some problems,  but he's throwing rocks at my young gal.  Well, we learn a little more with this clip. 
[00:59:00]  Thank goodness.  And as we were filming the sign, we could see the neighbors who put it up were outside.  So we approached them for their side of the story.  Why did you put that sign up?  I've been harassed for six months.  My daughter's been assaulted.  By who?  By the young boy.  We got pictures and everything, and they would not press charges because he is handicapped.  The neighbor claims Colton threw a rock at his young daughter,  and other neighbors told us they have frequently found Colton wandering onto their property. 
[00:59:30]  Still, the Disability Law Center says using offensive words is the wrong way to handle a difficult situation.  People with disabilities are probably the last group for whom we continue to use language that is hurtful and offensive.  No.  Instead of being someone who is mentally retarded...  I'll vouch for that.  Maybe number five on the list.  And that means that really what we're valuing is the person.  Listen to the way this...  Listen to the way this... 
[01:00:00]  If anyone wants to know what a revolting thing political correctness is,  listen to this dumb bitch trying to dictate the way you describe something.  Don't say it honestly like he's mentally retarded.  This way we're valuing the person?  The person?  Really stupid?  Is that what it says?  You value the person?  Because you phrase it longer?  What a dope.  She said it's fair game.  She goes, mentally handicapped people are still fair game, apparently.  The last people that you can make fun of or have offensive names for and not really getting that. 
[01:00:30]  What that woman is, to be politically correct, she's an irritating whore American.  Oh, very nice, Jim.  Maybe a neighbor could put a sign up next to her house.  Whore around and her husband will nod and go, you got it, buster.  Listen to this guy, Tony in Brooklyn.  Of course, this comes from Brooklyn.  Go ahead, Tony.  I am so ashamed to tell this story, but I used to teach special ed adults,  and these guys were all like real profound, retarded, nonverbal.  And these guys would punch you, beat you, kick you, beat the shit out of you. 
[01:01:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!  People are going to miss your nice story.  Yeah, if you curse, they're going to miss some of your story there, buddy.  So in order to get back to these guys, we had to come up with a way to do it.  And we'd take them into the bathroom, say, it's time to wash your hands,  and give them like a little C-shot right to the old nutsack,  and nothing would, and it wouldn't leave a mark.  And I'm going to hell for that story.  You'd kick them in the groin.  I'd give them a little, you know, like a little... 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, to calm them down.  You'd kick them in the groin to calm them down.  Yeah.  All right, I'm going to hell.  Because it wouldn't leave any marks.  All right, thank you, sir.  We're just tuning up the retards in the bathroom.  Yeah, let's go to Rob in Connecticut.  Rob.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I was just saying, don't be too hard on this poor kid.  He's on track to finish kindergarten by the time he's 32.  All right, later, boys.  You guys suck.  All right, very nice.  Thank you, sir.  Well, disabled advocates for the disabled.  Wow, it's a language.  Developmentally, that means we value the person. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  Shut up.  When I was growing up, people always used that word in front of me and stuff.  They always called me retarded.  Someone who knows how hurtful that word can be is Tom Brownlee, who today is an advocate  for those with disabilities.  He rocked.  I hate that word.  It was very offensive.  And I just want them to see that people with disabilities deserve the respect that they  are entitled to.  Both Brownlee and Nelson are hoping the community will stand up against any behavior that lessens 
[01:02:30]  the role of people with disabilities in society.  Regardless of a cognitive disability that I may have, I'm a person.  Yeah, really?  And people do not deserve to have signs pointed at them, making fun of them, scaring them,  harassing them.  He can't read it, stupid.  He doesn't care about the sign.  He thinks it's a big sugar cookie.  Dumb bitch.  Shut up.  You make a very valid point. 
[01:03:00]  Not the sugar cookie.  He can't read it.  So it's not offending him.  Of course not.  He thinks it's a giant Christmas tree.  And that's just a lovely decoration.  The poor lad, he's running around going, Santa's coming.  And his family's going, oh, shut up.  It's insensitive to the family.  I believe it's hurtful.  I feel like I'm sure the parents of this kid have enough bad feelings about it that they  see that sign and feel bad.  But for this advocate to come out and say it makes the person feel bad or it demeans 
[01:03:30]  the person is wrong.  Jimmy's right.  That person has no clue what the hell that sign means.  Anyone who considers himself an advocate should have a boot driven into their groin.  I hate the word advocate.  I'm an advocate.  Are you?  Advocate.  And by the way, she said that developmentally disabled, that makes you value the  person.  How is that valuing the person more than saying somebody is mentally retarded?  Um, I don't know.  Because you take an accurate phrase and you use it to be derogatory, all of a sudden the 
[01:04:00]  phrase is no good anymore?  Yeah, even if you want to use it for good.  I'm not talking about racial slurs, but I'm saying in an honest thing that saying somebody  is mentally retarded.  Yeah.  They're mentally retarded.  Oh, that's bad.  You used to call your friends that when they do something stupid.  Retarded.  Don't be retarded.  You're being a retard.  How much fun is that going to be?  Don't be developmentally disabled.  That guy.  Really?  He's disabled.  Take all our fun away, why don't you?  You're acting handy capable.  Right.  You want to hang out with that retard? 
[01:04:30]  Speaking of which.  Hey.  Hey.  Steve C comes in.  Right when we're talking about retards.  Pirate earrings.  Pirate earrings.  Steve C.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Steve C.  Arr.  The C.  I love the C.  The wardrobe hasn't changed in easily three years, but you just noticed these things.  I just noticed.  You know what it is?  When you walked in and the window's behind you, and I saw those two little stupid globes  with lights shining through them, I wanted to remove them with a stick. 
[01:05:00]  Arr.  Arr.  Would you try, please?  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  And you got your harr cut, didn't ye?  Didn't ye?  I certainly did.  Arr.  Arr.  You have to take your booty.  There.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Here's the last clip.  Arr.  Your crew died.  How did that happen?  Arr.  You're on my ship.  He just came in.  Arr. 
[01:05:30]  Can't something.  Arr.  No, stay in the hull, Captain Bly.  I'll handle this.  That's right.  For those of you just tuning in, an ass has just entered the room.  Arr.  Because you're in my effing crow's nest.  That's way too inside for Buffalo.  I know.  Buffalo, you'll catch up.  You've got to catch up.  You'll catch up.  You'll understand.  Steve's retarded.  That's all you need to know.  Let's go to Doug in Virginia. 
[01:06:00]  And now he's a pirate.  Doug.  But he was a bear.  Now you know.  He's a bear pirate.  A bear pirate.  What's up, Doug?  What's up?  What's up?  Then he raised the sails with claws.  That's right.  He's going to be in Romania.  But instead of like the hook to his nose, he'll have it in one of his stupid whole earrings.  Have to dance for tourists.  Have to tiptoe dance.  Doug.  Hey, Doug.  Well, I can't go over that shit.  You can.  Of course you can.  Give it a try. 
[01:06:30]  Let's go, Doug.  And I made the dump list.  Okay.  So you guys are missing the obvious one with the rocks.  With the retard strength, they're probably the size of pianos.  Okay.  He threw a car at my son.  Right.  Now, if that's the case, there is truly a problem.  Because you do know there is some type of...  Is there a scientific fact behind that?  Retard strength?  Retard strength?  Definitely.  What is it?  I don't know.  I mean, there's probably...  Is it that you don't have the mind power, so you get the muscle power? 
[01:07:00]  They don't feel pain.  Is that they don't feel pain?  They don't feel pain.  Well, listen to you.  They don't.  Maybe you use all your...  Pear Hughes.  Use all your energy.  I'm guessing you use all your energy where you don't know you're only supposed to use a little bit.  A little bit.  Or rip something.  So you twist that bunny's neck.  Right.  They're very pettish.  Not really.  All right.  Let's go to Rob in Utah.  Rob.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey there, Rob.  Morning, Rob.  Hey.  Hey.  This must be the same kid who used to harass me.  We live next door to some freaking retard. 
[01:07:30]  Used to come into our yard.  We had some dogs out back there.  I used to throw stuff at the dogs.  Broke our windows once in my mom's car.  Freaking used to chase my little sister around.  And not in the good way either.  And I just have to wonder if this is the same kid or not.  And second of all, why is this even an issue?  I mean, why is this offensive?  Because he can't understand in the first place.  Jeez.  How many years ago did this happen?  This must have been four or five years ago.  Well, he was nine then, which meant he had the – if he was not four years ago, he had the mentality of a minus one-year-old. 
[01:08:00]  God, this is –  It's kind of sucked that you finally decide where you want to live and you pick out the house and next thing you know, you've got a neighbor from hell.  Yeah.  I'm just thinking neighbors in general where you're like, oh, my God, I've got to live next to these people for 30 years.  Throwing washing machines at you.  Right.  You've got to feel bad for the kid.  But if your kid's acting up and he's got problems, you've got to kind of control him.  I mean, it's like you feel bad for the kid.  It's not a kid's fault. 
[01:08:30]  I was part of a social experiment back in the 70s.  It was called mainstreaming where they would take retarded kids and – profoundly retarded kids and put them in school to mingle with normal children.  How did you do?  I turned out okay.  He's retarded, but he does great impersonation so he won't throw apples at him.  You'd think he was the real person.  He's a rain man.  He just –  You should see Anthony when he's not on the show. 
[01:09:00]  Contrary to popular belief, I was one of the normal children, okay?  Yeah.  They brought in these profoundly retarded children and we would have lunch with them and do like art class with them, things like that.  Not math, of course.  They would eat the pencils.  But we would have lunch with them and have recess with them.  And there were some kids.  I remember a certain few of them.  One was he had a giant head.  Water head.  Water.  He had water on the brain or something. 
[01:09:30]  And his head looked like the hiney head aliens from Star Trek.  Little like jaw, little cheekbones, and then this giant light bulb head.  And he couldn't hold his head up.  So he would sit at lunch and his head would teeter, teeter, and then go around in a circle, like down so the chin would hit his chest, around so he's looking at his shoulder, and then back up straight again. 
[01:10:00]  And we used to make that sound when he would do it.  All the kids.  This is how cruel the children were.  Another kid, we called them goat eyes.  His pupils, he had some kind of mental problem, but also his pupils were wide and furry.  You ever look into a goat's or a horse's pupil?  Yes, sure.  They're not round.  They're just kind of rectangular.  He had those eyes.  It was the weirdest damn thing. 
[01:10:30]  And then, of course, there was Dally Dooley, who I've spoken about before.  Dally Dooley's name was Gallagher.  His last name was Gallagher.  But he couldn't say Gallagher.  So we'd say, what's your name?  He'd go, Dally Dooley.  So his name was Dally Dooley.  And we used to have to play recess with him.  And we'd play wiffle ball.  And he would hit the wiffle ball with the bat underhanded. 
[01:11:00]  And we'd be like, you hit it like a retard.  You'd call him a retard.  Because he'd swing like underhanded.  You don't do that, Dally Dooley.  Dally Dooley, watch us.  And we'd have to teach these kids, or try to.  But it got to the point where more kids were being made fun of than were being taught,  so they stopped the program.  My problem is, what is profoundly retarded?  Trying to just say brilliant things without expecting it?  I want to be judged. 
[01:11:30]  Not by the color of my skin, but by the content of my character.  That is profound.  And you're retarded.  My God, was that profound.  Change of diapers.  Lift your legs up, hon.  Thank you for your driver's license.  You know what sucks is the...  Burden in the hand.  Right.  You know what sucks is the pregnant women aren't drinking and doing drugs anymore.  Yeah.  So you don't have as many opportunities to see the waterheads.  A lot more tests that they can do early on in the pregnancy,  and kind of get rid of that thing.  That made high school very entertaining. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Hey, one more clip here before we wrap up.  We're really late.  Goodie.  Exploring legal options as we get back to the story.  I hope that one gal speaks up again.  Oh, she's a firecracker.  We contacted Nephi police.  They are working with the Juab County attorney who told me tonight he finds it distasteful  and derogatory and is researching what legal options may be available.  None probably.  Since the neighbors still refuse to take the sign down.  And the Disability Law Center is planning to meet with local officials to offer sensitivity 
[01:12:30]  training there in Nephi.  Thanks, Sam.  Thanks, Sam.  Thanks, Sam.  Sensitivity training.  That's another thing in this society that has to end is sensitivity training.  Sensitivity training.  Ugh.  You can't train people to be sensitive.  People are what they are.  We're a bunch of animals.  We really are.  Until people accept the fact that we're just another creature on this planet, you can't  change the way you think, really, or feel about things.  Just that some liberal boob is going to sit in a room and tell you how to hyphenate when 
[01:13:00]  you say something.  Yeah.  Don't say that.  Say, disabled American.  Thanks.  I feel much better, though.  Hey.  Thank you.  Handy.  I feel better about myself.  I feel capable.  Oh.  Does that mean he does math any better?  No.  No.  Shut it.  He's still a blithering idiot.  That's right.  Unfortunately, we're going to stop right here because we've got to take a break.  All right.  We're so late.  Put on the breaks.  We'll go to break with this fine little ditty from Stephen Lynch, though.  And I'll bring us back in, so stick to the drums.  Oh, on the drums?  I want to hear it.  I have a new tune to bring us back into.  I want to hear it.  Jimmy brings us back in with the drums after this. 
[01:13:30]  Don't go anywhere.  Watch them run.  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Oh, boy.  Watch them laugh.  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool.  That's diving.  At the Special Olympics. 
[01:14:00]  You're judging pity.  And I know full well that I will burn in hell.  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball have got to be about the funniest freaking thing I've ever seen in my life.  At the Special Olympics.

[01:17:30]  Oh, did you?  Oh, it's awful  I can't wait  All right, wait  I have been bummed out  Since he stopped making movies  His movies were the funniest movies  Forget Adam Sandler  Steven Seagal  The guy deserves a comedy award  In the last 15 years of making movies  All right, Dennis  I love his straight-to-video movies  Can't get enough of them  Dennis, were this  No, a lot of his movies were straight-to-video  Somebody was in the theaters for a long time  At the moment he was big and fat  And he had the Indian jacket on  And he was chasing Michael Caine  Who was the big oil executive  That was a good one 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, that was a good one  Lately, though  They've been either straight-to-video  Or cable  Straight-to-cable  And when he tries to do those high kicks now  And that big fat foot  Tries to lift it up  It's embarrassing  Is he doing movies still?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Oh, dude  Right-to-video  Box-off-a-star  Yeah, really  Barely-to-video, by the way  Hey, Dennis  Because we're this damn good  We got Mojo Priest  Steven Seagal's latest CD  He plays  Steven Seagal and Thunderbox 
[01:18:30]  Would you like to hear  Thunderbox  You want to hear a taste of Love Doctor  Let's see what else  Does he sing?  Well, wait  Love Doctor, BBQ, or Hoochie Coochie Man?  I want to hear alligator ass  It's got to be Hoochie Coochie Man  That's that  All right, let's go  Does he sing?  Yeah, just a little taste  A little taste  From Steven Seagal's CD  That's coming out today  That Dennis Leary's buying  It's dropping  So far, so good  Yeah 
[01:19:00]  A gypsum woman told my mama  Yeah  Before I was born  She said you're gonna have a boy child coming  And you're gonna be a son of a gun  Yeah  He sounds drunk  Little women  Yeah  Don't face out  Everybody, let's get to the hook with this  And the world gonna know  What they're gonna know  There he comes  Bring it on home  Yeah

[01:20:00]  You could find something  With less range than his films  And if you did  It's his voice  Wow  Because everybody knows  He's a hoochie-coochie  No one knows that, fat boy  Very nice  Whatever a hoochie-coochie man is  Are we on the clean show  Or are we on the dirty show?  We're on the clean one  Yeah, but you're dirty either way  So who cares  They'll dump out down the hall  Yeah, just  Be careful down the hall  Whatever you want to do  Hey, we gotta go right to John in Jersey  Because he's got a nice compliment  For Dennis Leary  John, what's up? 
[01:20:30]  Good morning, boys  Hey  Hey  Hey, uh  Dennis, listen  First of all  Best show on TV right now  And Garrity is one of the funniest characters  Ever created  Okay  The scene with him  Sleepwalking two weeks ago  I left so hard  And my daughter  My four-year-old daughter  Woke up in the middle of the night  And sat down  And watched the rest of the show  With me, by the way  That is the funniest show on TV right now  Garrity  I just love Garrity  Awesome  Thank you  There you go  Yeah, people digging the show, man  Yeah, Rescue Me on FX  Tonight, 10 o'clock, man 
[01:21:00]  The show is pretty nice  Everybody's digging the show  Except T-Mobile, I guess  Yeah  Well, you're getting some good press today, though  Yeah  You know what?  They can take Michael Douglas' wife  And have whatever fun they want to have  What do you mean T-Mobile isn't enjoying you?  They pulled their advertising  Because of the content of our show  Even though their ads  There's some ads that are done by Snoop Dogg  Yeah  So, and I have a content problem  And Paris Hilton  And Paris Hilton, yeah  Yeah, Paris Hilton and Snoop Dogg  Do some ads for T-Mobile  Yeah, for T-Mobile ads 
[01:21:30]  But, you know, we're too dirty for them  All right  Good  All right  Maybe we can get CEO Robert Dotson  On the phone in the show  And discuss this  You know, Snoop is one of the guys  Behind the Girls Gone Wild videos  Yeah  Amongst other things  Wasn't he a gangbanger at one point in his life?  Uh, no  Snoop?  No  He was driving by  And he was driving a car that shot bullets  And he didn't know it  That's what happened  Okay  Yeah, get your story right  T-Mobile stinks  Wait, what part of the show didn't they like? 
[01:22:00]  Was it a particular episode?  Or the content in general?  I guess it was the content in general  Especially the sex content  And the quote-unquote rape episode  You know, which if you  You watch it, yeah  I watch the show, you know  So I just  It's like  One of my favorite experts  Was a woman who went on CNN  To talk about the quote-unquote rape episode  And she hadn't even seen  Never mind any of the episodes  That episode in particular  She hadn't seen  But she was an expert on CNN  An expert  Talking about how wrong it was  You know  We talk about this stuff all the time 
[01:22:30]  These experts  And they don't even bother  Even watching the show  They're going to comment on  I saw you guys  When the president said shit  Over an open microphone  So the whole world could hear  Yeah  Meanwhile, you know  You guys and Stern and myself  And whoever else  Are constantly dealing with the FCC  And Colin Powell's son  And what we're allowed to say  And what we're not allowed to say  And he was the president  With a mouth full of, you know  Rural  And at a dinner  Saying shit over an open microphone  Come on  Yeah, they called it colorful language 
[01:23:00]  When he says it  When we say it  It's called obscene  And it costs $350,000  Yeah  The president, I'm sure  Did not pay a dime  No, I don't think he did  Technically, in his defense  I will say he thought  The microphones were off  And he was saying it  In private conversation  Whoever left the mics on  Hey, he shouldn't be a potty mouth  Even in private life  That's right  A little bit of a hypocrite  Didn't he born again  Set an example  Yeah, set an example, right  So Dennis, we really don't know  How you feel about this T-Mobile thing  You're holding back a little, I think 
[01:23:30]  It's not like you to hold back  I don't know what's wrong with you today  Well, you know  You know what it is also  It's unfortunately  And fortunately, Dennis  You're not under the radar anymore  Rescue Me used to fly under the radar a little bit  Now a lot of people are watching it  Emmy nominated  And I gotta say  I have never seen you get more ass  Than in this season  What the hell  Dennis is writing in now  I can see you sitting at the writing  And I get laid  Yeah, he's obviously the head writer 
[01:24:00]  Alright, I don't care what happens  In the storyline  I have to  I get laid  Next week  I get laid  Right  Dennis, you're constantly having sex now  Well, what would you guys do?  I'm not saying it's a bad thing  It's just a variety of women  It's great  You get an opportunity  You know  It presents itself  Yeah  Hmm, Marissa Tomei  Now, should she sleep with Gary?  Yeah, exactly  Hmm  Maybe she should sleep with Tommy 
[01:24:30]  Yeah  Amazing, man  You're just the stud of the firehouse  Hey, at least you're with women, though  What's going on?  That is a weird storyline going on there, man  With the pregnant?  Yeah  Wait, wait, explain for everybody  He's not gay  You know, he makes a decision  Before, I'll put it this way  Before the season's over  He makes a decision about which way he's going to go  Oh, he does?  Might be surprising to some people  But it will definitely be funny 
[01:25:00]  He's with a guy, you know  And they hang out  And they watch, you know  The ball game together and everything  But the guy he's with  Services him in various ways  That cause him pleasure, let's say  But he will not reciprocate with the guy  Right  Which means he's not gay  Right  What he's doing is he  For the sake of the country  He's investigating  The wherewithal of, you know  Sexual law  Let's put it that way  Right  What makes you gay?  What makes you not gay?  That's what he's doing 
[01:25:30]  And he's doing a pretty good job of it, too  Yeah, he says he's not gay  Cause he doesn't do anything to the guy  He lets the guy do things to him  And it's okay  Cause he's saying no homo, so  Yeah, yeah, right  Once you say  As long as you say no homo  It's fine  But then he calls him a faggot  And they get into fistfights  It really is a relationship  You don't usually see on television, Dennis  Hey, speaking of faggots  I want to change gears a little bit  Did you see what George Michael was tapping?  Yeah, what the hell?  Did you see the picture?  No, I didn't see the picture  I just read about it 
[01:26:00]  Oh my god  This guy  Did you see the picture?  No, where's the picture?  It's online  Where's the picture?  E-Rock had it up  He's like an old guy  Yeah, he's a 58-year-old guy  Big pot belly  And he drives a van for a living  Or something  He's no looker  Let's  And this was like at a park, right?  Yeah  Yeah, he went into the bushes  And a reporter was up there  And as soon as they were done  The reporter starts running toward George Michael's 
[01:26:30]  And he starts yelling and screaming  Like it's not illegal  And got out of there  They're just following him around at this point  Waiting for him to trip up again  Well, then why doesn't he stop it?  I know, knock it off  Jimmy, here's the picture  Look at this guy  That's what George Michael's  George Michael  That's what he's going after now  Hey, son  I'm sure there's a father-son thing going on there  He looks like an older British me  He's got pale legs  And a fat gut  And a stupid crew cut  Yeah, but his calves aren't as nice as yours, Jimmy 
[01:27:00]  Well, it should be  His knees are probably strong  British dad  Dennis, it definitely looks like  It could be Jim Norton's, like, older uncle  Yeah  Oof  Freep  Well, why doesn't George Michael just stop it?  Get a hotel room, for Christ's sake  You're a rock star  You bucks  He doesn't have to go into the bushes  At some kind of a park and ride  What a creep  Hey, uh, go Sox, Dennis  Oh, yeah  Go Sox  All right  I want the Red Sox and the Mets  And the World Series  20 years later, baby  You might get your wish, man  I would love to see that 
[01:27:30]  The way A-Rod's going, you know  Well, I mean, but Detroit's having a fine year, too  All right  The kid makes a few mistakes  You've got to love Ozzie Guillen, though  How about that guy?  How about being on his pitching staff, you know?  Why?  He's about three weeks away from getting one of his pitchers  To actually pull out a gun and shoot a guy  I love the fact  That he just acts like there's no  There's nothing wrong with what he's saying, you know?  Yeah, they wanted him to  I didn't hit the guy  He didn't hit the guy  I fired him  Yeah  Yeah, and he's the same one they wanted to 
[01:28:00]  He wanted  He trashed some sports writer in Chicago  Which is great  Because players never just assault these guys verbally  He trashed some sports writer  And they wanted him to take the sensitivity training classes, right?  Yeah, and he called the guy a fag or something stupid  Wonderful  Come on  All right  Hey, Dennis, so what's on the show tonight?  Tonight is...  Oh, man  What is tonight?  He's getting laid  Tonight is Tommy's big breakdown  Oh  Yeah  Which is actually... 
[01:28:30]  I mean, it's heavy, but it's also incredibly funny  But he finally hits the wall  He finally hits the wall with his survivor's guilt tonight  And that's...  And Marissa Tomei, I think, is making her final appearance tonight  So it's the culmination of that relationship as well  And I saw Adam Ferrara this weekend  When's he going to be a regular?  You said he might be a...  Oh, Adam  You know what?  I just said Adam is in episode 10  Which is not next week, but the week after  You know something?  Cool 
[01:29:00]  He's got a straight dramatic scene  And he was fantastic  My pal  The best acting I've ever seen him do  He was really, really great  Yeah  It's a really...  Very cool  It's a big, dramatic scene about the 5th anniversary of 970  It's great  Hey, when do we get our little part?  You know, us walking on the sidewalk or something  You know what?  I've got to let you guys apart, you know?  Maybe something dumb where we're like, I don't know  Getting a magazine from a newsstand  While a real scene is happening  While a real scene is happening 
[01:29:30]  I thought you guys would be interesting  If we went in as like a gay couple at work  No, that's all right  I don't need to be on TV that bad  Look, I have a suggestion  You've got to play against type, you know?  This is Jim Norton  So you're acting chops  I would like to play the second half of a...  I want to play somebody who's dating a transgender  And we're both trapped in a fire together  Yelling help out the window  And we're rescued  Me and a tranny get rescued together  That's what I want  I don't have to show my acting chops  I'll just yell help and wave  Ripped from the headlines, Jim?  No  Well, that's an interesting wish, Jim 
[01:30:00]  Well, not in real life  I mean, just in the show  LOL  Yeah, no, no, I understand  It's fictional  Yeah, you know, just for the art of it  Okay  Write that one down  Jim Norton, transgender, naked, fire  No, not naked  Hey, when are you coming in again?  As soon as I can, guys  Alright  Oh my God  I'm going to shoot him  And then I go away for a vacation  And the Emmys  And then I come back after the Emmys  Good luck, man  Congratulations  That's fantastic  I got a call

On the fact that  He did one of the  Mantown commercials  For a Greg Hill show  On AAF  And we're supposed to, what  Lay into Dennis  For doing a commercial  For a radio show  We can't help it  If Dennis has bad taste  If Dennis wants to be in bed  With other men like that  That's not a problem  Friends of mine  I do a nice favor  Of course

Two, four, six  Eight of them?  Uh, these  Six  Six?  He tries to say carbon dioxide  Six times  It's gold, Jerry  It's gold  Alright, we'll get into that next  It's the ONA virus  Spreading across America  That was a clip from Anthony

[01:34:00]  You're checking out  The Opie and Anthony show  The ONA virus  Spreading across America  I guess Neil doesn't like us, huh?  Can't take it, Neil  Leave  Goodbye  I guess we hit a little too close to home today  What's the problem with Neil?  People laugh and laugh and laugh  Until it, uh  It hits, uh  Too close to home  And he's, uh  From the old  WB.com there  A website  You know which one I mean  Uh, it says  Opie and Anthony  Your mean-spirited 
[01:34:30]  Mockery of people with disabilities  You're kidding, right, Iraq?  What?  Thank you  Uh, where was  I missed it  Didn't I say keep it up there?  I did  Opie and Anthony  Your mean-spirited  Mockery of people with  Could you unhighlight it?  Thank you, Iraq  See, when you highlight it  Uh  When you  When you make the background black  When you're trying to read black type  It causes a problem  Opie and Anthony  Your mean-spirited  Mockery of people with disabilities 
[01:35:00]  Sucked and it wasn't funny  I hope you both get in a car accident  And end up with speech impediments  And colostomy bags  You effers  Are blithering  A-holes  So he's one of two things  He's either a really big fan  Who wants us to yell at him  Yeah  Or he's just a douche  And a ha-ha  We hurt your feelings  Deal with it, stupid  Can't take it  Just hit too close to home  Exactly  Yeah, that must be it  What's the matter?  That brother that you have to take around  Was that it?  That drooling 51-year-old 
[01:35:30]  You have to introduce  Must be a personal problem  Of course it is  Alright, really fast  We have the Kevin Smith and Joel Siegel thing  It made the Daily Ten on the E channel  That's pretty cool  Ooh  This Daily Ten is the latest gossip show  It's really, really good  I check it out every night, actually  A couple of shows I check out on E is  The Daily Ten  And of course, The Soup  The Soup  But they took our audio  And they really ran with it  Of course, Clerks 2  Where'd they go?  Clerks 2 did pretty well 
[01:36:00]  Good  I think it made about  Nine, ten million dollars  You know, it's not gonna be  One of these blockbusters  But it's gonna do very well out there  It's gonna find its audience  There's a slow build on the theaters  Right  And then the video is what  The DVD  Right  That's where they make huge amounts of money  And the backstory  Joel Siegel  A movie reviewer here in New York  He walked out of Clerks 2  The screening  And he said it was the first movie  He's walked out of  In 30 effing years  Or something like that  He didn't like the discussion 
[01:36:30]  On bestiality  That takes place in the film  Just the discussion of bestiality  Was enough to make him walk out  And make a huge scene  So then we had Kevin Smith on  And then Joel Siegel called the program  And Kevin Smith was confronting Joel Siegel  And Joel Siegel had no idea  He was talking to Kevin Smith  It was a whole thing  And E! has taken the audio  And they ran with it last night, I believe  So let's take a quick lesson  That was quick 
[01:37:00]  So fast I barely heard it go by  That morsel from Clerks 2  Only scratches the surface of raunch humor  That writer-director Kevin Smith serves up  So raunchy  That ABC film critic Joel Siegel  Vetoed the movie  Yes  At number 5  Smith apparently turned Siegel's stomach  So much  That the critic actually stormed out  Mid-showing  At a recent screening  Yelling to his fellow colleagues  First movie I walked out  In 30 years 
[01:37:30]  On his website  SilentBobSpeak.com  Smith let loose  With an expletive-laced tongue  Lashing at Siegel  Ironically  Smith said he was elated  With Siegel's disapproval  As much as he was  With the 8 minute ovation  The movie received at Cannes  There you go  And then they got into it  A little later on in the show  My question is  Can I ask why  They have that stupid music  Playing behind  People  What does he think  That half of us  Are going to listen to his voice  And the other half 
[01:38:00]  Are just sticking around  For the tunes  What a douche  I don't get that either  Yeah  Awful  Because we all have  Short attention spans  What  So you got to keep it  As interesting as possible  It's like that  Clip show mentality  Quick in quick out  Yeah  The two ended up  Going toe to toe  On the Opie and Anthony show  Funny thing is  Siegel has no idea  He's actually talking to Smith  Why isn't  Walking out of a movie  You know that's like  The ultimate criticism  You know  That's fine  Walking out of the movie  Joel is one thing 
[01:38:30]  Why would you be the guy  That yells  And interrupts the movie  For other people  There are other critics  In that screen  That are so unprofessional  Man  That is so  That's like newbie  Man  That's newbie  First year hack critic behavior  They're really stretching it  I don't think Joel understands  You're talking to Kevin Smith  Right now  Where's Kevin Smith  You've been speaking  You've been talking to him  The entire time Joel  You want you to resign Joel  Clerks 2 opened  At number 6 this weekend 
[01:39:00]  At 9.6 million dollars  There you go  That was pretty cool right  That's great  The quality of the audio sucked  Yeah what the hell  Are we recording on  I don't know  Like an 8th generation  Through the internet  I think that was real audio  Real audio  That was them  That was them  It was really them  Nice  We gave them crystal clear audio  Alright  Stupid music  Hi Laura  Hi  How are you  Fine  Look who's here  Hello  It's Laura Keitlinger  My friend  Yes 
[01:39:30]  You two  Work together  Yeah we haven't seen  Each other since Hollywood  You know  He is the worst  He always tries to come off  Like a bit  I know  I know  You are  I talk to my  My co-star  I understand  You have things like  Co-stars  And TV shows  And things like that  But it annoys me  That you  You speak like that  It was so nice  We saw each other  In the dressing room  You look good  You too  We give the kiss  On the cheek  Ready for your scene  Laura 
[01:40:00]  Here's the beauty of Laura  Like me  Her and Rick Shapiro  We were the three comedians  On the show  Besides Louie  And all three of us  Are just paranoid  Low self esteem idiots  It's true  We're gonna get fired  Laura would go  I'm gonna get fired  I'm gonna get fired  I'm gonna be like  I know  Me too  We all think we suck  And we're gonna get fired  But Jim is such an angel  He's very comforting  And very nice  And here  You know  I think probably  I don't know  If you have  If everyone knows  But your sweet  You know  Interior  You know  And your  I mean I know  You're kind of gruff  A few girls know  About his sweet interior  Don't know it's sweet 
[01:40:30]  When it's on their back  But  Jim  He  You know  He bakes banana bread  And brings it in  For everyone  And makes cookies  From scratch  For the director  Aw  He's adorable  He's a faggot  He's the best  He's a nice guy  People know I'm a nice guy  But you know  Any inkling  Of  Of  A diva  Some kind of like  Tantrum  Cause he knows  He can't really  Pull anything like that here  Without us  Giving it to him

[01:44:00]  And they roll over  And woo  There it goes  Yeah  Little dogs are the old people  They're just the worst  They roll over on the floor  As soon as you acknowledge him  They can't help it  Crap  I think it's  I think it's  I said crap like an idiot  The nicest  Sorry  Excuse me  Yeah he's gotta crash himself  I had a crash myself  I'm sorry  No  Lindsay and I were on the  Westside bike path  Over the weekend  And there was a chihuahua  Hung like a 
[01:44:30]  Like a Doberman  And everyone was looking  It was  It was a freak of nature  Pride of Chelsea  And the little things  Just walking on  You know  And everyone is just going  Are you  Do you see that  I can't stand the little dogs  That do it  It's usually like the little ones  Right  That roll over like that  And you have one  I do  He's  The light of my life  And I have two cats  Oh boy  You're almost crazy cat lady  I am  And I didn't see the bestiality scene thing 
[01:45:00]  But I mean I love my cat  But we never get to that point  I hope not  I mean we both  Did you ever think about it though  For a goof  For a goof  I mean sometimes  Just for a goof  No one's looking  If you know  If the dog can't  You know  If I have like a sitter over  I'll always say  You know sometimes  It's hard for the dog  To get to sleep  So if you just give him a little  If you don't mind  Just relieve him a little bit  Come on  Help him out 
[01:45:30]  My friend Jimmy did that to me  This is true  When I was a kid  What you had trouble sleeping  And he  I got the stories confused  That is a pal  And then I would just pretend  That I had trouble sleeping  No but he had a dog  And I looked down  And I couldn't believe  He was holding the dog up  And his hands go  And the next thing you know  On my arm  And I'm like  Dude  Wow  Dude  Why  I didn't know if I hated him  Or worshipped him  It was like the most disgusting 
[01:46:00]  Slash amazing thing  A buddy has ever done  Horrible  Hey we gotta say hi  To Jeff in Cleveland  Jeff  Yeah yeah you do  She was gonna look up her skirt  Like you did the last female guest  You weren't  No she's wearing jeans  She's smart  We had the mother from Sixth Sense  Sitting right where you are Laura  Uh huh  And she had this like  Sundress on  Uh huh  And Jimmy and I were  I don't think Ann could see  From his anger  I had a little bit of an angle  But I didn't have as good  An angle as Opie did  To explain  Like Laura's sitting  Way below us right now  On a couch 
[01:46:30]  And uh  Jimmy and I were trying  To figure out  If she had panties on  Or not  The whole interview  Instead of conducting  A professional interview  Who wouldn't  Yeah  We were just trying  To figure it out  Just staring at her legs  And just trying to get  A crotch peek  I'm thinking we put a camera  A hidden camera  Right in that panel  Hey that's not a bad idea  That's very low  It would get us  Up the skirt shots  On every girl  That comes in here  And we could sell them  To like  Those magazines  A lot of money  Yeah that could be  Our new thing  Up celebrity skirts  Yeah  And I don't like the fact  That you were working  On another project 
[01:47:00]  Behind everyone's back  You're sweet Jim  It's a uh  You're sweet  I love it  But wasn't that  A kind way to transition  I mean I guess  It really was  Let's be honest  You barely remember  His name at this point  Lucky Louie  Stopped taping  What six months ago  She called me by  My TV show name  She's like oh hi Rich  Oh Jim  Jim that's right  We almost had a relationship  She moves them right along  I'm out campaigning  I'm you know  Talking about the show  And I uh  You know shaking babies  And kissing hands  And like 
[01:47:30]  Just like a  A politician  But it's called  The Minor Accomplishments  Of Jackie Woodman  And it's on IFC  And it's about  You know  Two women  But the thing is  This has been going on  For like four or five years  So I was just  I was surprised  That they even picked it up  At this point  But it's about two women  Who um  Once a screenwriter  And once a producer  And they're losers  And they uh  Still have hope  Even though they probably shouldn't  And um  It sounds depressing  Doesn't it  Isn't that wow  No  I mean it's 
[01:48:00]  I think it's  It's very realistic  In a way  I mean I guess  I keep saying  It's sort of the opposite  Of entourage  Because it's about  Two women that aren't  In demand  Two you know  People who aren't  Making it  In Hollywood  Are we looking at  A comedy  A drama  A dramedy  If you will  No  It's a comedy  It is a comedy  It's just a regular old comedy  It's the way you described it  I know  I have to work on that  There was no comedic content  Whatsoever  I don't even want to see it  I was waiting for the part  Where you talk about rape  No 
[01:48:30]  The cancer survivor  And she's a writer  Way to sell the story Laura  Lifetime wanted to pick it up  But it went to the  Independent film  Way to sell it  I'm sorry  You know  That's what I told them  I said don't send me out  I'll just depress everyone  They'll be driving off the road  I can't  Comedians  We're the worst  At selling our stuff  Yeah  Believe me  It's like  You don't want to oversell  It's like  Alright look  This is just  With your bare bones  This is what it is  And this is just  It's about a guy  It's a show about a guy  I just want to say  It's about two losers  I mean they're more losers  Than winners in life 
[01:49:00]  And they're more interesting  So isn't that enough  Still no  That's not it  And them just going through life  And  But it's funny  But it is  It's not loser like  They're crying  That they have nothing  No no no  And there's  You know  There's sex  We're thinking  That we might have  Video games across our chest  Just so that the guys  Will tune in  Very good  Watch  Yeah  Guys like sensitive comedies  You'd be surprised  Yeah  Well I guess  It's not  It's not that  I mean no  It's not  It's not actually 
[01:49:30]  A sensitive show  When are you on?  Be funny  It's Sundays at 10.30  On the network  It's Friday  Friday at 11  Fridays at 11  On what channel?

[01:50:00]  You don't have any midgets  In your family  Because this would be  Really awkward right now  No  Just free charts  That's fine then  We have  Disgusting listeners  And there's a guy named Ozone  Who did a midget sighting  Back in the day  When we worked with him  At WAF  So now that we credit him  And whenever there's a midget sighted  They'll call in  And describe the humiliating little person  There you go  Let's say hi to Steve in New York  Steve  Good morning boys  Hi Steve  I went and stopped at Dunkin Donuts  This morning  Get some coffee  And there it was  It was a female 
[01:50:30]  And what appeared to be a male  Both midgets  Buying coffee  Buying coffee  I'll share it with you  Yes that's correct  So the only thing you really saw  Were those little  Vienna sausage fingers  Reaching up at the counter  For their coffee  Yes  Grabbing the cup  With both hands  It was very  Both hands  With just the palms  Of both hands  That muffin like palm  Of the hand  Grabbing on either side  Of the coffee cup  And walking away  And instead of picking out  Like a dozen donuts  They're picking out 
[01:51:00]  A dozen donut holes  And they won't call them  Munchkins  Right right  It's offensive  Right  It's offensive  Right  Wait are you guys  You can't call people it  Well  You kind of can  Because to them  It's like  That I'd say for babies  Oh it  To them the munchkins  Are like  Back at the show  It's like walking into  A chicken place  And being black  And picking up  Little Enners  Little what?  I know  How do you not get the joke? 
[01:51:30]  My goodness  If we could only say it  On this god damn channel  Oh okay  Enners  Imagine KFC Enners  That well that would be like  A midget walking in  For munchkins  At a Dunkin Donuts  Okay  You want to explain to Laura?  No  I would get it  I had to crash myself again  Because I stink  You just abbreviated something  And I didn't get it  And no one got it  Because  Enners  Could be a word  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  You didn't realize  You were being filthy  Yeah I wish we could just  Use racial epithets

[01:57:00]  We're doing a TV commercial  Oh  For the Opie and Anthony show  Right  Cool  It's very funny  And it doesn't involve you  No it shouldn't  Oh  It's so bad even saying that  I know it  Why would it?  Yeah  Why would it?  Why would it?  Actually the plot of it  Doesn't really  It can't use three people  Yeah no  It's a two man thing  It's a two man thing  We're a pilot and a co-pilot  And a fighter  Yeah  No that's not the idea 
[01:57:30]  It's  Gay lovers  Jimmy there's still people out there  That don't know you exist  Oh I know  When they're making these big decisions  I know  But you're the secret weapon  It puts us in an awkward position all the time  Way to look at it  Is CBS?  Yeah  Okay good  Why would they?  Why?  Well they don't even know your real name yet  They still call you Ed Norton  I know  They call him Ed Norton  Yeah  The guy who runs the radio division for CBS  He calls him Ed Norton  How ridiculous  He called him Ed Norton 
[01:58:00]  It was one of the greatest moments ever by the way  Ed Norton  He comes in to welcome us to CBS  We're getting ready for our first broadcast across America  Being syndicated all over the place  And he walks up to Jimmy and goes  Hey  Heard a lot about you Ed  Yeah  Did you?  Oh  Mike Pop had a good one  What?

[01:59:00]  Because you've used the C word referencing women so many times that you've desensitized me to it  Ah I don't use it that often referring to women only specific incidents  Only when they deserve it  Exactly  That would be any time you talk about a woman  That's not true  No it really isn't  You're acting like one right now by belly aching about it  But just belly aching  Stop you whinging  That was very cool  Alright  I think it's more effective to use against guys  Yeah it's absolutely more effective

[02:00:30]  Here's some  Well maybe it did  What happened miss?  She likes being called  Actually  It had a reverse effect  It was very empowering  That I could just sit and laugh at him  And it's  Really?  Do you think of that when you're scrubbing the toilet?  Shut up  Stop trying to tell yourself that  You hate my guts  Be honest with me and be honest with you  Here's something  When you're telling these little stories  Have a point  It makes it so much more interesting to the listener  You don't like me  Keep out of it  You don't know how I feel  You don't like me

[02:04:00]  And that it's not like Miss America  Which is based on like talent  And stupid stuff like that  This is just about how hot the girls are  They parade them out in various outfits  And people vote on how hot they are  They don't care if they got a brain in their head  And then they vote  Whoever wins is Miss Universe  Right  That's nice  And I was commenting on the Donald  How many planets he's actually called girls from  And coincidentally enough  Just Earth has made it into the finals  Not one girl from another planet  And it's the whole universe 
[02:04:30]  It's the whole universe involved  I don't think that Donald really looked  Mars wasn't up to it  Mars has ugly chicks  Ugly chicks  Apparently  How do you know?  I would think because of the atmosphere  Because they have five boobs  They're ugly chicks  Jupiter  Fat chicks  Because of the gravity  Ah  Pulls them all down  Who's got the thin chicks?  Thin chicks  I think some place like Mercury  Would have like thin chicks  Venus and Mercury  Because it's hot  Very hot  Well they're  Less gravity  That's where the darkies live  The smaller planets 
[02:05:00]  That's where the darkies live in the universe  Too close to the sun  The taller  Taller chicks are on these smaller planets  Yeah  Pluto  Skinny  Like model chicks there  Alright  Here we go  So  This is what's weird  We gotta talk to Donald Trump  Miss Universe  Hot chicks  In all sorts of hot outfits  They have a  A woman commentator  And a gay guy  And a gay guy  Why ruin it with a gay guy?  I understand  Look  You gay guys want to have your own shows 
[02:05:30]  You put them all over  You got your own network now  That's what logo's for  You got your own logo channel now  You play all the gay stuff you want  Could you stay out of the programming  That is based on guys sitting there  Looking at hot women  The only thing this show is  Is parading around hot girls  For guys to look at  In bikinis  Lingerie  Things like that  Do not bring a gay guy into this  I tell you one reason  They're probably doing it  Is they think they're going to get 
[02:06:00]  Women to watch  No  Because they think that  The funny repartee  Between the two of them  Is you know  Attracts female viewers  Because they think  They got the guys  No it's not  Yes  And who's the gay guy  The blonde guy from  Queer Eye  Carson  You know his name  I guess  I guess I know all their names  There's Carson  And the other  I don't know any of these  All right listen  Here's the intro  Here's Carson  And who was the chick  Last year's runner up  For Miss Universe

[02:44:30]  Would have probably  Skated through  Yeah  Because I had stated  That the guy  Missed out on having  The disease  Named after him  How about this  What did Wally Pipp  Die of  Lou Gehrig's disease  What if he died  Of something  And then  But he wasn't famous  Enough to be  Wally Pipp disease  Right  He had to die of something  Maybe they would have  Maybe he died of a really bad cold  And they would have  Renamed the cold  Because he was that great  And he'd have been like  I feel like  The most fortunate

Well you're not paranoid  Someone very well  May be watching you  Here's NBC's  John Larson  For more than a year  This man had been a regular donor 
[02:55:00]  At a sperm bank in Pasadena  But one day  After completing his mission  Into a paper cup  He looked up  And noticed a hole in the ceiling  I saw a small camera  With a wire  Going into ceiling tiles  I didn't know where it was going  I didn't know how long it had been there  Or where those private moments  Might turn up  It could be on  Websites  It could be on  Pornographic  Videotapes  It could be anywhere  Follow the wire back

[02:57:30]  He's a bag  Oh you like that  Don't you faggot  Nobody's got age 
[02:58:00]  I'm a little disappointed  Wow this is really  Buttery  Not buttery stuff  Nope  This is buttery  Not as buttery as the first one  That was less buttery  Stop it  What defines buttery?  I don't want to explain it  That put the butt in buttery  That is some gay  Dancing  Like really  But see you're confused  Buttery doesn't mean gay  What does it mean?  Smooth  Smooth 
[02:58:30]  Buttery  Yeah  That was a little too harsh  That was very harsh  Yeah  That was techno  There was some glass in that butter  I hate a buttery beat  Those words bother me  Bothering buttery beat  Does anyone else watch Intervention on  What channel is that on?  A&E  A&E and Laugh  Yes  I'm serious  Yeah all the time  It is the greatest show on TV  I love watching the people  And I'm not going to be sucked in to feel emotion from these people  No 
[02:59:00]  Their families are all in denial for so many years  And then they figure they're going to fix them in a day  Do you agree to leave right now?  No  See everyone wants me to say no homo before the buttery beats  It's not a homo thing  It's buttery beats  You keep telling yourself that  Because  The examples that I've been given  Yeah  It's great music to do a popper and catch AIDS to  Alright let's go to Jerry in Jersey  Yeah  So Dirk's learning about buttery beats 
[02:59:30]  So that's a little  That wasn't as buttery  No  You guys missed it man  The guy in Pasadena is going to get paid to whack off  Well the guy got paid to whack off to begin with  Because he's going to the sperm bank  But now he's suing  Yeah now he's really going to get paid  Just to jerk off  I mean what  Yeah it's a great life actually  That was really funny that the wire went back to his studio at XM Saturday  He's fucking playing it off like he's all upset 
[03:00:00]  I have a buttery back  Alright  Let's hear something about ride  Alright Jerry we get it  Goodbye you stuttering  You nervous goose  You're buttery beats bro  Shut up  Alright here he goes  Here he goes  Fucking cranky  He's suing the sperm bank  He's suing the sperm bank  Pacific Reproductive Services  The company denies filming anyone  And suggests that his account is fabricated  But his story has alarmed already concerned privacy advocates 
[03:00:30]  Who say in this increasingly wired world  You gotta wonder  Is someone always watching?  Yes  Yes  Did it alarm them?  Yes  Someone is always watching  Well and of course they gotta add this to the story  The camera's presence here unannounced  I believe is an intrusion in privacy  Bill Brown gives tours of surveillance cameras on public streets in Manhattan  Who is there to reassure me or you or you 
[03:01:00]  That this camera every night isn't watching a woman undressed in a building across the street  Public safety advocates point to crimes  No one  First of all Bill Brown is a fucking douche  Why would the city  First of all private camera owners could do that  And why is the city going to install cameras that people can watch women  No one is watching women with the cameras  And if they are  You fucking  You arrest the guy who's doing it  Yeah  You shouldn't have a new technology 
[03:01:30]  It's a crime  That can help fucking catch a crime on film  Because some scumbag might misuse it  Privacy advocates are idiots  People go around pointing them out  Man  They take people around  Yeah  Look man there's another camera  They're gonna film you man  Yeah and they're gonna see me what walking down fucking Broadway  Gives a shit  Who cares  They're mostly bore cameras  You pop these up on the internet whenever you want  You go to a city cam or a live traffic cam  And you can look all over Manhattan 
[03:02:00]  All over New York City  Well we talked about  And you know what you see  Dullness  Yeah we talked about it in the past  You're on camera more than you're not  More than you're not  When you walk around Manhattan  When you're in the city  Walking  Driving  You're on camera  More than you're not on camera  That includes obviously going in and out of buildings  Yep  Hey by the way  Can we get Bill Brown on the phone  Do we know who he is  I would love to have him  If not today  Maybe tomorrow  I would love to fucking  Buttery Bill Brown  I'd love to get him on the phone  Yes  Privacy advocate  Buttery beat alert  We got another one coming  No we don't  Yes we do  But first  Who's deeming these buttery 
[03:02:30]  He's obviously  I am  You can't  The last one wasn't as buttery as the first  I'm sorry  I don't hold you as the buttery beat authority  I want to know who came up with this  I came up with the buttery beats for the show  But who came up with the saying  And what is it based on  Like someone came up with  With New Wave  I was playing Luminous  One of the greatest video games ever  And you said this sounds buttery  On PSP  And I just felt like  I don't know  It might be  I think I heard it somewhere else 
[03:03:00]  Of course it's a saying somewhere  Oh alright  We got the definition of buttery beat  Alright  Good now  Luminous is the greatest game in the world  If you have OCD by the way  Yes  What is it  This is the description of Luminous on the back  Oh  What about a description of buttery beats  Okay here we go  Yeah I did get it from Luminous  I'm sorry  Bust blocks  Groove through puzzles  And jam wirelessly with friends  Stack them right  And you'll unlock  Lush looks  And buttery beats  Want to be luminous 
[03:03:30]  Just let the music guide you  Yeah I forgot about the  The lush looks  The lush looks  Yeah  What the hell is that  Yeah  Alright here's the rest of the clip  Public safety advocates point to crimes that surveillance cameras help solve  Like the kidnapping and murder of little Carly Bruscia  In London surveillance cameras helped identify terrorist bombers  Closer to home we've all seen nanny cams 
[03:04:00]  Violent babysitters caught on tape  And the technology is only making things easier  Cameras so tiny they can be hidden in sunglasses  A button  A necktie  Or even a pen  No permit required  And no way to keep them out of the wrong hands  The wrong hands  I want to get Bill Brown on the phone  And that's a great point  They identified the bombers in London  Yeah  I would love to know why that's a fucking problem  Identified that creep at the car wash 
[03:04:30]  Taking that little girl away  To kill her  Yeah that was so disturbing  Identified him  That was a bad  You know  That was a bad one  More cameras more gooder  Yeah maybe not we shouldn't have them though  Cause someone might  I don't want to be filmed walking down  Oh shut up  What do you got to worry about  You know who's most upset  Are the people that have the most boring lives  Like the people that aren't doing anything  I'm against that  What are they going to catch you  Mowing your lawn  Exactly  You're not doing anything  Something else was mowing it  Fucking Bill Brown  Listen to this guy 
[03:05:00]  Jeff from Virginia  Jeff  Hey boys what's going on  Jeff  I got a tour at a police station one time  One of my buddies is a cop out in Virginia Beach  And he said there's a particular stoplight  They have one of these security cameras  Pointing down on Saturday nights  They catch chicks giving blowjobs to guys in their cars  And they watch it all the time  That's a crime  It is technically a crime  That that video isn't released  To the general public  And the bottom line is you're going to get people like abusing technology  But then again I've always raised the example  Maybe we shouldn't have jails  Because people will abuse it 
[03:05:30]  I mean the system's going to get abused  So we shouldn't have jails  It's stupid  You can't like fucking nullify a new technology  Because some douchebag is going to misuse it  Cars are probably the most abused technology  That's ever been invented  Absolutely  More deaths caused by them  So what?  Get rid of them all?  How about electricity?  You think that was invented  So people could plug something into the wall  And cram it into their asshole?  Or so women could rub something on their clits  When their inept husbands don't satisfy them?  Is that why Ben Franklin ran around  With that fucking bald head in a kite?  But that's the results of it  But who's plugging in their vibrator? 
[03:06:00]  I'm just saying back in the old days  I'm sure in the old days  You had to, you know  You think you had to?  Plug it in?

[03:18:00]  See that  Jerk  That's  Terrible  I'm  Sorry  Let's  Try  Now  Asshole  Asshole  Asshole  You like  Movies  About  Gladiators  Grr  Grr  Grr  Grr

[03:19:00]  You found the ultimate buttery beat right there, Dirk.  Yay.  That ends the buttery beat bit.  And Dirk goes, thank you.  Please.  All right.  Where are the old ladies with their vibrators?  You old broads are letting us down today.  Goddamn rich cunt.  We want one old broad.  Carla.  Hey, guys.  How old are you?  I am 19.  Yeah, we need 41 more years on you. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, I know, but I wanted to tell you guys about a sex move that I invented.  It's pretty fucking awesome.  You're 19, and you invented a sex move.  I did.  Are you going to patent this move or what?  I probably should, because I think it's going to be a pretty big trend now.  Now, you think you really invented it in all the years?  No one has done this before.  All right.  Well, Carla, what is it?  It's called the clucker.  The clucker.  Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[03:20:00]  You've got to slow it out.  Hold on.  Slow it down.  Wait.  What is it?  You just talk through sex?  We want to, like, enjoy the fact that you call it the clucker, first of all.  Yes.  You call it.  Well, it'll make sense in a second.  Here's how it works.  It works best if I...  Shut up.  Wait a minute.  Shut up.  We're going slow.  Holy crap.  Carla, you've got to learn something.  Yeah.  You've got to learn to, like, take your time with certain things.  Obviously, the clucker is where you snort, like, crystal meth out of the guy's penis. 
[03:20:30]  Now, now, it's called the clucker.  That's an original name.  Okay.  And now, see, we don't want you to go right into it.  We want to kind of, like, dwell on that and maybe think about what it could be based on the name.  But you're just, like, plowing through.  What is it, Carla?  No, don't, don't, don't add.  No, shut up.  Jimmy, shut the fuck up.  Jimmy, shut the fuck up.  Oh, God. 
[03:21:00]  Are you ready for it yet?  No, no, no.  Fuck her.  Cigarette hijacking clucker.  What am I, a clucker on wheels?  All right.  Let's hear what the clucker's all about.  All right.  The clucker...  The clucker...  The clucker...  ...works best when standing on a chair.  Who?  When I would stand on a chair.  Please tell me if you can hang yourself.  Okay.  You got that visual, right?  No, I don't.  Let me get the visual. 
[03:21:30]  Hold on.  You are standing on a chair.  Yeah.  Now, is there any difference whether you're facing the back of the chair, the front of the chair?  Is it a kitchen chair, a stool?  You're standing on a chair.  More of, like, kitchen chair for me to hold on to, you know?  Okay.  All right.  And can I ask a question?  Where do the buttery beats fit in to this scenario?  Well, they really don't, but I could say maybe I listen to it when the clucker's occurring.  All right.  So you're on a kitchen chair.  Standing on a kitchen chair. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hopefully it's one of those folding chairs and she steps back too far and snaps her knees.  Holds up.  Breaks both of her calf muscles.  Well, it's got to be done.  While she's yelling.  While she's muscle bones.  Slop around the room screaming in pain.  You fuck in the ass.  Calf muscle bones.  I couldn't fucking talk.  Oh, the clucker.  I hope it's when you get your ass rammed with a drumstick.  I mean a chicken drumstick.  Oh, it's a little close.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  What happens?  Come on.  You're on a chair.  You're on a chair. 
[03:22:30]  On a chair.  My boyfriend has his dildos strapped to his head.  You know what I'm saying?  No.  Not at all.  It could be a vibrator.  But you've really got to fasten it on his head.  Okay.  And he goes at it.  I mean, it can either hole, really.  So he fucks you with the vibrator while you're on a chair and he's there like a chicken pecking  away at you.  Oh, man.  He's clucking.  Wait.  Is it strapped to his head like by his face or on top of his head?  Yeah.  Well, it's more like kind of unicorn, really. 
[03:23:00]  Not like a unicorn?  Listen.  Why is that the clucker?  I can't speak for anyone else, but I'm not a big fan of silly sex.  No.  That is the silliest thing.  Silly sex stinks.  It's awful.  That's a good one.  I mean, it's good for me.  I don't know.  First of all, no one does that in bed.  It's just a funny thing that you thought of.  Why not just lay on your back and fucking cram it in your box?  Forgive me for speaking so gruffly.  Look, I'm a fan of the oopsies. 
[03:23:30]  I like the oopsies.  And a little giggle when you realize you slipped and it's in her ass.  But the silly sex thing.  As far as an inventor goes, you are to sex what that guy was with the wings flying off of the rock.  It's not quite there.  I think you failed miserably with your invention.  You did.  Fine.  I won't patent it then.  But you know what?  You just wait. 
[03:24:00]  People have been talking about the clucker.  No, they're not.  No, here's what you do.  Here's how you make the clucker better.  You're standing on the chair.  You drape one foot over the other side.  And then you drop down.  So the back of the chair slams your pussy.  And then you run around the room going,  Gop, gop, gop, gop, gop.  Well, you know what, guys?  Double job a lot.  Up your ass.  Yeah, there you go.  That's the clucker.  Just because we didn't like the clucker.  Exactly.  We had to go there, huh?  Your black and blue vag lips.  Gop, gop. 
[03:24:30]  The sound our dad makes when he walks in on them doing that.  Gop, gop, gop, gop, gop.  My little dad.  He's trying to say, gop, gop, gop, gop, gop, gop.  Gop, gop, gop, gop.  Gop, gop, gop.  What are you?  Gop, gop, gop, gop, gop.  All right.  The 25 biggest wusses ever.  All right.  We start with Robert Smith in 25th place.  Robert Smith.  Lead singer of The Cure.  Oh, right.  The Cure.  The Cure, very wussy.  Yeah. 
[03:25:00]  I can't listen to one song.  But very moody, too.  Comes on.  Ugh.  It's like enough shut up.  Not a big Cure fan, are you?  No.  Cure fans are for goth fags.  What about the love song?  What love song?  I Will Always Love You.  Don't know it.  Don't care about it.  If it came on, I'd switch it right off.  It's a great song.  Quicker than a Springsteen song.  Springsteen.  No.  No.  Fuck you.  Now, come on.  I'm on fire is a great tune.  He's an old man.  Shut up.  We have a little love song.  I like that.  Pink Cadillac.  All of his songs are horrid.  Cure. 
[03:25:30]  Is this buttery?  Is this a buttery beat?  It has a little butter to it.  A little bit.  I wonder if Steve likes this song.  Wow.  All the depressed kids listen to this, man.  That's right.  Yeah.  Kill yourselves.  You really don't like The Cure?  At all?  Not at all.  This is okay so far.  There would not be one Cure song that could come on that I would not instantly change the station.  How about like in between days?  Nope.  I don't know what you're saying.  Here we go. 
[03:26:00]  Whiny ass.  This is all right.  This is on the radio.  You're driving by yourself.  You're thinking of things.  And all of a sudden you get the goosebumps.  And you've got to sing out the chorus.  What's the chorus?  Uh, it's coming up, I guess.  It's not bad.  No, it's not bad.  All right. 
[03:26:30]  Uh, let's say hi to Eric in Buffalo.  What's up, Eric?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  What's up?  Yeah, I invented another sex act.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, the Italian shower.  The Italian shower?  Yeah, it's when you, your brother, and your dad jumped in the shower.  All right.  Enough of you.  He was trying to teach us to shower.  Uh, yeah, he sure was.  Someone.  He had two buttery sons.  Buttery.  There's a lot of butter in that shower that day.  Someone is actually saying that, uh, the clucker is a ripoff of what is commonly called 
[03:27:00]  the screw-na-corn.  When you strap dildos to your head.  Yeah, all right.  Let's, uh.  The screw-na-corn.  The 25 biggest wusses ever.  24th place.  If you have no comments on them, that's fine, because we can move on with the list fast.  Donovan.  I disagree.  Donovan.  All right, fine.  I've heard of Donovan, of course.  The 50s guy.  I can't even name a, can you name a Donovan song?  He's 50s.  Um.  What?  Let's see. 
[03:27:30]  He didn't sing Dead Man's Curve, did he?  Oh.  Worst song ever.  Does, uh, Derek got Mellow Yellow?  All right.  Mellow Yellow.  That was the line.  Oh, this is good.  I'm just mad about Saffron.  Saffron's mad about me.  Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  I'm just mad about Saffron. 
[03:28:00]  Uh, by the way, Nathaniel has a much better list of the wussiest, uh, people in music  ever.  They give their wussiest.  Of course he does.  They give the wussiest moment.  Really?  And for The Cure, or Robert Smith, it was The Love Cats.  The Cure's fluffball 1983 hit, which features Smith literally meowing over a tune best suited  for preschoolers.  Oh.  You know Love Cats, right?  No, I don't.  You're lying.  I don't.  I wouldn't lie to you.  You don't know Love Cats?  I swear to, let me hear something, I'll tell you if I know it.  It was a huge hit back in 83. 
[03:28:30]  I was fucking doing drugs back then.  83, I was listening to The Cure.  I was playing this crap in college.  I was listening to fucking Ozzy and Sabbath and Kiss and D.O.  You'll hear it.  Love Cats.  Like, Love Cats.  Holy shit, no.  You know this song.  I don't know it.  Never heard it. 
[03:29:00]  I hate that big stand-up bass he's playing, though.  He'll fucking smash his gay face with it.  I never heard this trash.  I like this.  Shut up, you do not.  I swear to God.  You're gay.  No, I'm not.  You're gay.  I like some Cure songs.  I hate this one.  You know it, right? 
[03:29:30]  I like it.  It's a pop song.  Pop song?  It's a pop a dick in your ass song.  It's almost like guilty pleasure.  No.  It's on your iPod, isn't it, Jimmy?  No, I've never heard it.  I like it.  You'll be downloading it, though.  You bet I will.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, God.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Love Cats.  All right.  By the way, Donovan should be given a pass, free pass, as Joe Wagner points out. 
[03:30:00]  Why?  No, Joe Wagner doesn't point out.  It's Tug McGroin points out.  Yeah.  Because you jackasses.  He did Atlantis, the song in Goodfellas where Billy Bats is getting whacked.  I don't kid.  This is the song?  Look at Derek, fast.  It's the chorus part, which is 18 minutes into the fucking song.  What's the chorus?  How does it go?  Just say it.  Can't you fast forward?  No.  By the way, Donovan's wussiest moment, he sang, I didn't know this, sang backing vocals 
[03:30:30]  on Yellow Submarine.  That's not his fault.  What's wrong with that?  It's a great Beatles song.  Why is he a wussy guy?  Like, I don't consider him anything, really.  He sang with the Beatles.  I mean, yeah, the guy sang with the Beatles.  Oh, you got a piece of that?  Let's see.  Way down through the ocean.  Goodfellas.  Through the ocean.  Where I want to be, she may be. 
[03:31:00]  Way down through the ocean.  He's kicking the shit out of me.  That's great.  His hair looks like fucking Gabe Kaplan in the military.  Stupid Sam.  Gabe Kaplan in the military.  All right, let's move on here.  23rd place.  Welcome back, Milata. 
[03:31:30]  Holy shit.  God damn, Jimmy.  Welcome back, Milata.  23rd place.  Oh, that's going to have me all fucking day.  23rd place.  Because we're trying to get out of here at 11. 
[03:32:00]  Because we got meetings today.  Right.  We really do.  23rd place, everyone in NSYNC.  In NSYNC.  We don't need to even go there.  Yeah, yeah.  22nd place, Natalie Merchant.  All right.  Lead singer of 10,000 Maniacs.  21st place.  They call him the father of wuss.  Pat Boone.  All right.  And the reason?  Father Debbie Boone, who's appalling 1977 smash.  You light up my life.  Appalling.  Father Debbie Boone. 
[03:32:30]  He said Father Debbie Boone.  Why?  Why?  He said Father Debbie Boone.  Father Debbie Boone.  I said Fathered.  Oh, Fathered.  I think you said Father Debbie Boone.  No, Fathered Debbie Boone.  Maybe I talked for that.  No, no.  You probably said Fathered.  Who's appalling 1977 smash.  You light up my life.  It's the worst song in the history of the world.  Damn it.  It was a number one hit, though, wasn't it?  It's actually a good song.  It stinks, Jimmy.  What's wrong with this song?  This is great. 
[03:33:00]  She's hanging out by the winder.  By the winder.  Oh, yeah.  Why are you lonely?  Oh, I see.  This is a good song.  Welcome back, Moana. 
[03:33:30]  Shut up.  You're a damn rich cunt.  I kill rich cunt.  Holy shit, did that stink. 
[03:34:00]  No, I'll give you a better one.  I am master of the pan flute.  Oh, God, Jimmy.  Sorry.  It smells like sour milk.  I need lactate.  That's going to make you sick.  You want more?  All right.  Oh, God.  Smell it.  Pure health. 
[03:34:30]  Welcome back.  You're not black.  You can hang in the south without being swung around.  Well, your race sure has changed since your people came around. 
[03:35:00]  You're not.  We need you back here.  Yeah, we need you back here.  Yeah, we need you back.  We're hiring you back because you all look black.  It's obvious we've had too much energy in this show.  So let's bring it down a notch with Pete Popolardo. 
[03:35:30]  Hi, Pete.  Hi, Pete.  Welcome aboard.  Hi, Pete.  Good.  Hi, Pete.  Hey, Pete.  How are you?  I'm doing really well.  Hey, sounds it.  How are ticket sales?  Well, we finally figured out how to wake up Boston.  Cheap bastards are buying all these tickets.  There's only a couple hundred left.  A couple hundred left?  All right.  Yeah, so I think we found out that your Boston fans are just cheap.  Well, it is Worcester.  That is true.  I think it was just a money issue.  It is Worcester.  So basically, my guess is probably within the next hour or two, all those tickets will  be gone. 
[03:36:00]  So anybody who wants them, get them now.  They're good.  All right.  How's Nashville?  We got to sell some more tickets in Nashville.  Nashville, Jimmy, is going to be sold out for you.  No, it won't.  Yeah.  You're going to be close.  Yeah, you're going to be fine there, Jimmy.  I hope so.  Our guy was just telling me that.  I'm doing some press down there on Thursday afternoon.  All right, Pete.  Anything else about the O&A traveling virus?  No, you got to talk to me.  Petting zoo stuff, O&A pest booth.  Have the pests contacted you about their booth they're going to have?  We are working on it.  They've already asked us if they can bring paintball guns into the venue. 
[03:36:30]  Right, right.  Of course, it's no.  I don't think that's going to work.  Yeah.  Anthony, I thought you would be disappointed that no guns were going to be permitted.  Yeah, I know.  We want Tippi Tom in the petting zoo.  That's fine.  We can put whoever you want in the petting zoo.  We ever find the shortest woman?  We have not found the shortest woman yet.  Damn it.  We need some of that freak show stuff for the O&A Village.  We do have Drown the Clown, who is very, very excited about doing this, actually.  Is he familiar with the show at all?  Yeah, I think he is.  Yeah, yeah.  No, he is.  In fact, we're talking about getting him to Cleveland, too, so it should be good.  Hey, Pete.  Pete, is there an email address where people could actually write you with ideas for the 
[03:37:00]  O&A Village?  I thought that was all going through Kenny and then coming to me, but they can send it  to me if you want.  All right, because we're searching for some freaks, you know, like the shortest woman.  We want to put her in a chair and have her watch Friends, and you just kind of watch her.  You just look at her.  You watch her live.  That's right.  Yeah.  We want to do that and some other things.  If I give you an email address, is it going to be crashed momentarily?  No.  Well, what's Kenny's email address?  We'll do it that way.  What's that you're going through? 
[03:37:30]  Which one does Kenny want to give out?  I'll give out a safeguard one.  No, no, no.  Nah, forget it.  Do we know which one?  Wait till we know.  Here's Steve.  Hi, Steve.  What?  ClubSoda at FoundryMusic.com.  ClubSoda at FoundryMusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y Music.com.  And just to get Pete's attention, make sure you don't send a picture of a cock going,  hey, Pete, suck this.  Don't send that to him because he'd hate that.  Pete's not going to see these.  Oh, yes, he will.  They're all getting forwarded to him. 
[03:38:00]  This is...  Kenny forwards him to Pete.  Yes.  Yes.  All right, Pete.  Thanks, guys.  Bye, sweetie.  Bye, bye.  We're going to get back to the entertainment.  Thanks.  That was wonderful.  Well, Pete's a behind-the-scenes guy.  That's terrific.  But that's good news, though.  The O&A Traveling Virus, DCU Center, August 5th.  Tickets are going very, very well.  All right, let's move on.  So, Pat Boone, we're done with him.  The father of wuss.  20th place, Garth Brooks.  All right.  Anything on Garth Brooks?  No, he's very popular, but wussy. 
[03:38:30]  Why wussy?  What's his wussy moment?  He did a great version of Hard Luck Woman by Kiss.  You know what's funny?  Of course he did.  It was good.  His wussiest moment in a Barbara Walters TV interview, she asked about his children and  his eyes filled with tears, and that made him a wuss.  Wuss.  Crying over his kids.  Doesn't qualify, you asses.  That's nice.  19th place, a fine band called Bread.  Bread?  What would you have against the bread? 
[03:39:00]  Exactly.  Why would they be wussy?  What's their big hit?  I don't know.  Derek has it, of course.  Derek, you got the...  Oh, If, right?  If was the big hit in 1971.  I'll play the big hit.  If was...  I got a communique from Steve.  Yeah?  Communique.  Bob Saget overslept.  He wants to apologize.  He's shooting a film.  What are you doing?  It happens.  Go ahead.  Is this If?  Yeah.  From 1971, this is Bread. 
[03:39:30]  If you told a thousand words, then why would...  This is 107.3, The Cougar.  The Cougar.  I wouldn't be surprised if one of those stations come out.  Big hit for Bread.  1971.  I just stepped on a little.  Shit.  It's a thousand words, then why did I leave you?  The words will never show up.  How many of you motherfuckers got married to this one? 
[03:40:00]  Ah.  Ugh.  Song by Bread.  Didn't they have like a rockin' song, though, too?  This is like their sensitive side.  Bread never rocked.  Bread never rocked.  Don't take the crust off.  Douchebags.  Bread.  I thought Bread had like a rockin' tune.  At least one.  Yeah.  No, they're in the soft rock category.  Are they?  Yeah, they're easy listening.  Maybe I'm a stuck. 
[03:40:30]  I bet you James Taylor's up there.  Maybe.  He should be.  Maybe not.  And Carly Simon, she can't sing in public.  Bob Saget.  Yo.  Hi, Bob.  Hi, Bob.  You let us down, man.  I had a fucking yeast infection, I apologize.  Oh.  Coincidentally enough, we were just playing Bread.  Yes.  That's why I said it.  My toe didn't rise.  I slammed the oven on my cock.  Hey, Bob.  Did Bread ever rock?  Yeah, they did Guitar Man, and I would know this, but David Gates, the lead singer, I think 
[03:41:00]  his balls were in a vice.  He had a very high thing going.  He really did.  He sounded like a woman.  That's why I liked him, because he had a china.  Got into this wimpy category, or wimpy.  Well, I named my oldest daughter, he wrote the song Aubrey, which is a very pretty song.  Remember that thing, and Aubrey was her name?  No.  Wow, you really?  You're a Bread fan.  You're a Bread fan, Bob.  Are you a Bread fan?  No, I used to be really gay.  Okay, that explains it.  It's a big difference, and I'd have sex with guys to the music of Bread, and I was at 
[03:41:30]  Buttery Tunes.  What does that mean?  Bread and buttery Tunes.  Except during Passover.  There's nothing wrong with that.  So you're shooting a movie?  I am.  I'm finishing.  I'm not shooting or editing as far as to the Penguins crazy thing I've been doing.  I've been in Canada, and I've just been killing myself for fucking Penguins.  Well, Penguins are really hot right now.  Well, these fuck, though.  This is Sam Jackson narrates it, and it's me and Christina Applegate, who gets anally raped 
[03:42:00]  accidentally by Louis Black, and it's Monique and Tracy Morgan.  We know how she feels.  And who I'm doing the thing.  I'm doing some of your dates with.  Yes.  Oh, Tracy's doing, I think, all of them.  And Monique, did you talk to her about her problem on United Airlines?  No.  What happened?  She seemed to have had an issue.  With the luggage or something that she was jumping on?  Yeah.  No.  She wasn't in first class.  There's no way to talk about the woman I love.  She wasn't in first class, but she wanted her luggage. 
[03:42:30]  No, no, no.  She was in first class.  She was in first class.  Oh, what happened?  Let's see.  TV News star Monique kicked off United Flight Sunday after getting into a spat with flight  attendants.  This time, the comedian isn't laughing.  She's crying racism.  I felt like I was being treated like an animal, said 38-year-old Monique.  Here's what happened.  She has a flight on United.  She's in first class.  Her peeps, of course, are in coach.  Her peeps in coach, one of them is her makeup and hair person, who proceeds to take a hairdryer. 
[03:43:00]  Now, we think of a hairdryer as a stupid little blow dryer or something, but something tells  me this was one of these big hairdryers, like old school beauty salon hairdryer, and tries  to put it in the up-front first class luggage storage spot.  What do they call those, Jimmy?  Overheads.  Overhead.  Wow.  Overhead compartment. 
[03:43:30]  And you're not allowed to do that from coach.  You can't put the goddamn first class.  Use up our first class storage.  I am on Monique's side on this one.  Shut up.  You are not.  I really am.  Honest to God.  Is that why, like, a skunk?  She said you were treated like an animal, and you had to act like a skunk and release  the most heinous smelling thing from your ass, Jimmy?  You know what it is, Bob?  I get nervous.  Oh, my God.  I can't breathe.  I have a nervous stomach.  No, what happened...  I've been in the room with you guys.  I didn't smoke.  Wow. 
[03:44:00]  Out of respect, I didn't because you were in the room.  I think I fucking refrained because you were there.  What do you have, like, a breakfast burrito?  Do you eat a lot of pork in the morning?  No, I actually have really good eating habits.  I think that's my body, just fucking pushing out all toxins.  No, it was...  Are you sick?  No, I'm very healthy.  I have a great immune system.  How's your colon?  It's actually not bad.  My logs are very, very solid.  I have solid, tapered logs.  Can I tell you something about that?  I'm going to be on the road with, like, three dates with you guys.  I want to know about this when I see you.  We're going to bring a doctor or something. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, no, I have really good logs, dude.  You'd be impressed.  I have very healthy logs.  Well, it's solid.  That's the only thing Milton Berle told me of value is a nice, firm, healthy shit, and  you're going to be fine.  Well, his shits were as big as his cock, I'm told.  Wow.  Did he have big logs?  Well, he had a giant cock.  I think when he flushed the toilet, he got pulled down.  That's not it.  He couldn't do the old courtesy flush as he was sitting there.  No, that's not right.  I think when you cough and shit, you should get rid of it so the other people don't have  to deal.  If you've been to the war, you'd know that. 
[03:45:00]  The war.  I know.  Great.  Great world.  Great one.  Big one.  World War II.  Which one?  I don't know.  World War IV is about to start.  Yeah, I know.  We see that happening.  It's such a big one, they're just going to skip three.  Are they going right to four?  Right to four.  We're going right to four.  It's one more.  Yeah, I love the way the Israelis handle this.  Yeah, they don't fuck around.  They do not fuck around.  They just, you took a couple of our guys, we're just going to blow apart a whole country  that doesn't even really technically involve these people. 
[03:45:30]  Well, I was walking, I've been dating a girl.  Here's a joke.  I was dating a girl who was half Jewish and half Iranian, and I didn't know whether she  wanted to blow me or blow me up.  It's a joke.  Bob, that's a little racially insensitive.  Yeah, but you're the one with the fucking overhead stuff.  I didn't know what to do.  I'm in Toronto, okay?  I'm walking with this girl, and I see people holding a sign, and we're in a free world.  I'm in, you know, it's North America, and people in America don't even know it's up 
[03:46:00]  here, and they're carrying a sign that says, Palestine, please, Israelis, get out of Palestine.  And it was just, it was strange, because they were like looking confrontational-y.  You know, they would have been happy to start an argument on the street.  It was like a gang of people.  It's just a very sad world, man.  Gang of toughs.  Hey, are you known in Canada?  You are, right?  Yeah, pretty much all over the world.  Worldwide.  Yeah, that Full House helped me in all the Nordic countries. 
[03:46:30]  What's Full House?  It was a show where older guys had sex with young kids.  Well, it was very, we were supposed to be straight, and we lived in a house in San Francisco  raising three little blonde bitches that didn't look like me.  Yeah, all guys living together.  Right, three guys, Uncle Jesse, and the Rippers, and the Beach Boys, and it doesn't get any fruitier.  And San Francisco.  Yeah, right?  And the kids didn't look, they looked nothing like me. 
[03:47:00]  I had like a Jew nose, and Dave Coulier's walking around, probably dropping the baby batter.  Yeah.  He had a mullet, kind of.  He did.  He had like a flock of seagulls, like upside down Phil Collins piece of shit on his head.  He made a big comeback.  He looked like Davy Crockett's cock.  He made a big comeback with that skating show.  Did he?  Well, you can't, now you're going to use them.  I mean, please tell me, please tell me you make fun of him.  I do, I love him.  You got to beat him up over that skating show.  I beat him up, I tell everybody he shaves his balls, they yell at him, he gets upset. 
[03:47:30]  I think he was partnered with Nancy Kerrigan.  I actually got hooked on that dumb show, I don't know why.  You know that, I was on the phone with Stamos, and he says, turn it on, our boy's in a dress.  Yeah, he had a song.  It's a good thing he shaves his balls, he won't throw his back out.  Yeah, he skated as a woman.  He got dressed up as a woman, and Nancy Kerrigan, big stretch, he dressed up like a guy.  By the way, he's a good skater.  Well, he used to play hockey, we all know that.  Yeah, you put me in a dress, I'll be a good skater to get the fuck away. 
[03:48:00]  Doesn't necessarily make you a good skater, you know, like that, if you play hockey, though, right?  You got to learn those stupid, fruity moves.  Well, that's what made it interesting, because they're like, he's a really good hockey player, but could he be a good figure skater?  Can he skate like a girl?  Yeah, he had to learn figure skating.  Because, I mean, let's get real here.  Yeah, it's the dumbest sport.  The guy figure skaters are not really the most masculine, manly guys.  No, they're not.  No, and they always show you how you dress.  No matter what cup you've got, you can see your Egg McMuffin. 
[03:48:30]  I don't think they're wearing cups there.  I think it's just pure junk.  Yeah, it's junk, and kind of a side mushroom shot, like it's been pressed in a book.  Yeah.  And the nuts act like it had a stroke.  It's always like two nuts.  They're like vertical.  It's a nut over a nut.  Yeah, they're stacked up instead of side by side.  Wouldn't it be funny if you'd take off your pants and they're still like that?  It's like a model in science class of the molecular structure. 
[03:49:00]  It's a hydrogen molecule.  Right.  You might call it a hydrogen molecule.  So what show is Bob doing?  You're doing every one except Cleveland, Bob?  I'm doing three of them.  I'm doing Wooster.  That's the big one that I fucked up and didn't call you this morning.  I'll probably stalk you now to get the promotion out right.  No, the tickets went great.  They went really fast.  DCU Center and Worcester?  Worcester?  Worcester.  Worcester.  That's August 5th.  Are they already gone?  That's what Rich Voss called it.  Yeah, the special giveaway we had today, pretty much the tickets are just about gone. 
[03:49:30]  And then August 26th, you're doing with us in Jersey, PNC.  And then you're doing South Jersey, September 9th, which is really the Philadelphia market,  the Tweeter Center in Camden, which is way South Jersey.  And you wanted to do Cleveland, but what do we got going on?  Something else?  Yeah, Cleveland, I'm not able to.  Where the hell am I?  I'm like happily busy for fucking finally, you know?  My phone rings off the hook because everybody knows I'm dirty.  Oh, to do gigs? 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, my stand-up's been really good.  I think I'm actually shooting something that week.  I'm looking.  What's the date of Cleveland?  September 23rd.  Here, hold on while I'm on the radio going through my day planner.  No, that's Jew night.  September 23rd is Rosh Hashanah, and I'm still a Jew because the war's still going on, okay?  Wait, you're not allowed to.  What's the deal with that?  You know, the Jew thing, I'd feel real bad.  My parents are almost dead.  I want to watch them before they croak.  My dad had a heart attack, and he almost died this year. 
[03:50:30]  So, like, he's doing better, and I've got to spend that holiday with him.  He's my dad.  Yeah, of course.  He's like 88, and this is really true.  He had full-time nurses, and he couldn't piss without a nurse.  He goes, they hold my dick when I piss.  How cool is that?  Oh, man.  How cool is that at 88?  I'm like, Dad, it sounds good.  I said, isn't that weird for Mom?  And he said, she doesn't give a shit.  The government pays for it.  So, my mother didn't care because, like, Medicare fucking paid for him getting jerked off. 
[03:51:00]  Where do your parents live?  In L.A.  Okay.  About five minutes from me.  So, that's the reason.  What's the address?  It's 1482.  Get over there, man.  They want to be raped.  Hey, this is...  Seriously, my mom, I don't think she'd stop you.  I mean, what's she going to do?  She just had her knee replaced.  She's going to run in a circle.  You know, you could hit her in the knee and do that Nancy Kerrigan thing on her with, 
[03:51:30]  like, a ball-peen hammer.  My dad is just going to drop to the ground.  He barely survived the year.  Jeez, mom.  Two of them will be like, you know when Curly, like, went around in a circle going...  Yeah, on the floor.  Right.  That'll be my fucking mom.  This guy...  There's a guy, Ben, from Piscataway.  Is this...  Was this a true scene from Full House?  Because he calls it the hottest scene ever, but I'm not sure of it.  Bob was in the tub giving a bath to one of Uncle Jesse's kids.  Yeah, this is true.  And he wants to know how you kept the rod out of the camera. 
[03:52:00]  How you kept your rod...  Well, it's funny.  If you look at that scene really carefully, I've got a rubber ducky with my cock in it.  Did you actually take a bath with one of his kids?  Yeah, but I don't remember...  I blocked most of everything I ever did on there.  What the fuck were they thinking?  Everything was Full House.  If you weren't Full House, you would have, like, not had any of the issues you had.  You had a different life 25 years ago.  Yeah.  25 years ago, you were on the air in New York, right? 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  And if I'd have had your life, I would have been out of my mind having fun and been crazy.  But instead, they said, you know, I got fired from some job on CBS.  They said, you want to be on a sitcom on ABC done by the people that did Bosom Buddies and Happy Days.  And I didn't realize what comes with that territory.  How many years were you on the show?  Eight years.  Fuck, man.  You've got to be set for life.  Well, it's good.  I'm doing really...  I'm very, very...  I'm better now than I ever was, actually.  They play it everywhere.  I mean, I've divorced, like, nine years, which is why I'm going on the road with you guys. 
[03:53:00]  Dude, you've got to be pulling in 10, 20 grand a year in residuals.  Could be more than that, Jim.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  Can we have some?  I'm making hundreds of dollars in residuals.  I actually get office supplies instead.  I had one line in Spider-Man.  I got residual checks.  Fucking...  I mean, they're small now, but I still get them occasionally every time it does something.  How much, though?  Well, I got $1,000 for the line.  $1,000 for that day.  And I've probably gotten about $6,000, $5,000 for that one line.  No, what I want to know is... 
[03:53:30]  Well, that's good for one line.  No, but what I want to know is all of a sudden you open your mail and there's a check because  of the one line in Spider-Man and how much is an individual check for that?  Sometimes it's $1.50.  A lot of times it's $39.  They take taxes out.  $39 for his...  Wow.  That's hilarious.  I have to deposit that.  Bob, did you get more money when you were in the bathtub with young children than you  did when you were just delivering dialogue in the living room?  I get money when I wipe myself now.  Honestly, that was decent money, the full house. 
[03:54:00]  But when you start on...  Everybody complains if they're working or not working.  Every actor thinks it's all...  I hate this show.  It's like, shut the fuck up.  You're working.  I can't get boring money in.  So you're playing a dork.  You can fix it one day if you fucking have any talent.  Right, right.  Unless you're Screech.  Unless you're...  Yeah, let's help him buy his house.  Let's help...  Oh, that poor fucker.  Yeah, you hear about him.  He lost his house or something.  Oh, yeah.  He swindled.  I think he's got a big cock, though.  A giant cock.  Yeah, apparently he's got this huge cock. 
[03:54:30]  With a nut over each nut, just like the skating guys.  He should do porno, then.  That would be great.  Like, bail himself out.  He could buy a good house, then.  How'd he lose his house?  He's bamboozled, somehow, so he says, by some fucking landowner.  It's something that should have been in 1860.  How did he lose his house?  He hasn't worked in 10 years.  Figure it out.  He was out doing stand-up and stuff.  He was doing club.  Like I said, he hasn't worked in 10 years. 
[03:55:00]  Really?  We had...  Get a job.  You should just get a job, you know?  Get a fucking job.  Remember when we had him on the show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was really bad.  Was he bad?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  One of the worst guests ever voted by our listeners.  The listeners vote him worst guest ever.  But in his defense, honestly, he was on a show with some of the hottest kids of that  time period.  It was Elizabeth Berkley, Tiffany Amber Thiessen.  Those two guys, Mark Goss.  What's his name?  Mark... 
[03:55:30]  David Chapman?  Mark David Chapman.  You and a bomber in a hoodie.  And it was...  What's his name?  The other guy, Mario...  Peebles.  Yeah, Mario Van Peebles.  You figure it out, faggot.  What was it?  You're going to have fun with me.  My stand-up's been fucking fun.  I've been having such a...  Honestly, we can't wait.  The listeners can't wait.  I've never seen your act, man.  I'm dying to see you on stage.  And I'm not doing like a full giant set, but that's plenty. 
[03:56:00]  I'll just blow the...  You know, blow...  I'll just blow the audience.  That's how I get it.  You're going to blow the audience.  Yeah.  Let's blow the audience.  It's awesome.  This guy's great, man.  By the way, when you're talking about Dustin Diamond, worst guest ever, there was a guy that  came in that was good at making balloon animals, and Dustin Diamond was worse than that.  Worse than the guy, balloon animal guy, and worse than the Whistler guy, the guy that  didn't come in.  Steve Whistler is one of the greatest freaking guests ever.  But he just came in and whistled.  Yeah.  Dustin should have made a balloon animal out of his dick. 
[03:56:30]  That would have been the difference.  Yeah.  He has a really giant cock, huh?  Yeah, apparently.  Look at the poodle tied in a nut.  I hear he could kick our ass, though, because he's got some of that karate.  He's a karate guy, right?  I think he's got some of that.  Anytime you play a geek like that on TV for that long, you have to learn how to do karate.  Big cock and a martial artist.  Yeah.  Kids love that fucking guy.  They love to screech on that show.  Do they, though?  Really?  Truly.  Because we weren't listening last time.  You're going to be on Entourage again?  They're saying they're writing one for me, but we'll see.  I don't know. 
[03:57:00]  That was one of the greatest scenes.  That was so much fun, man.  I was out.  I was at a concert last night.  I went to see Counting Crows, and somebody was standing next to Adam Duritz, who's a friend of mine,  and somebody said, boy, that thing on Entourage, that was amazing.  And people that know me, Adam was like, yeah, all Bob had to do was show up.  I was like, when are you going to start acting?  Was it dirty?  Yeah.  He's smoking dope.  No, no, no.  Oh, me?  Yeah.  I smoked a bong, and the idea was I banged every hooker there. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  Nice.  That was great.  Good boy.  I've never really even been with a hooker.  They fucking rule, dude.  They rule.  Jimmy's a pro.  You like a hooker better than anything, man.  I like a fucking hooker beyond anything.  I love a prostitute.  Because they just leave?  Is that the whole premise?  No, because they don't promise me love and then hurt me emotionally.  They fuck me, and they go, and they don't pretend that I'm something that I'm not.  You're a funny guy who says you are, like, sensitive.  Isn't there a chance you'd, like, fall for a hooker?  Oh, absolutely, dude, without a doubt. 
[03:58:00]  But, I mean, I start to develop feelings, and I get mad that they want to keep it financial.  I'm a fucking zilch.  But every time I really start to like a girl and care about her, I just get my fucking fat face smashed.  So I figure just keep spending the money.  Well, you know what?  This money kind of turns me off.  I'd rather just take them to dinner and buy them shit.  Whoops.  Yeah.  But the other thing is, I don't know about, sometimes if you're about to, like, have sex, if you're about to, like, cum, don't you, like, isn't your instinct to say I love you? 
[03:58:30]  Yes.  That's, like, the stupidest thing in the world.  He was, like, the time you're not supposed to say I love you.  You told me you loved me.  I was cumming in your face.  You said it.  You said it.  You meant it.  Please get out of here.  Here's your $500.  I used to bang a hooker in Vegas who would give me golden showers and full service, which is very rare.  She'd spit in my mouth.  It's kind of revealing about you.  I want you to know that.  It's completely true.  And she'd spit in my mouth.  And when I'd fuck her, I'd tell her I love my wife. 
[03:59:00]  I would say I love my wife while I fuck her.  Is your wife on the radio right now?  Why would you say that when you're not married?  I was pretending that she was going to be my wife.  Oh.  I meant her.  I was, like, I mean, like you.  I was saying I love you to her.  Like, I love you as my wife.  Wow.  It was really dirty.  That's good stuff.  You know, this broadcast alone is going to get you laid.  I know, dude.  I just isolate myself from women by being fruitful.  If I tell a girl I love her in real life, my cock wilts like fucking radiation has been thrown on it. 
[03:59:30]  Well, let me say something.  The only thing is she, you know, she would, I'd let her give me golden shower.  You acted like it was a privilege that you would get receiving one from her.  I was paying her.  Yeah, you paid her for a golden shower.  See, I don't know.  You'd have to fucking take me to the onion field to give me one of those.  Really?  A nice mouthful of fucking, tastes like popcorn.  No, it doesn't.  It does.  I'm not big on stuff that already goes through the filter of the body.  You know what it is?  Worthy.  He's enjoying something and making it trying to sound to us like it's something great. 
[04:00:00]  When people are shipwrecked, the last resort is drinking urine.  That's because they can't be shipwrecked with hard-ons.  Right, so maybe it's just about like being a survivor.  You're just like, we're so hot.  Right, we might as well be on an island together.  Let's piss.  Let's eat our own crap.  Jim would just be roaming around with piss in a coconut and an umbrella sticking out  of it.  A little straw.  Drinking piss.  There's plenty of water here, Jim.  No, no.  It's all right. 
[04:00:30]  There's vitamins in there.  There's no more milk in the coconut.  No problem.  I just filled it with a nice load of piss.  Well, we got a bell because we got a couple meetings today.  We're running out of time.  Hey, Bob, can you do maybe a video for our Cleveland show?  People would love to hear from you.  Absolutely.  Maybe like a couple-minute video just saying hi to Cleveland?  Send someone over.  Absolutely.  In fact, I'm with you guys before that.  Why don't we do it there?  Sounds good.  Yeah, that's not a bad idea.  You could just make fun and abuse the Cleveland crowd.  Yeah, I'm not going to tell them I'm celebrating Rosh Hashanah. 
[04:01:00]  I don't know.  I like that.  No.  No, you'll come up with a better excuse.  I'll come up with something real.  I'm getting blown by someone.  I'm getting peed on Survivor Island.  So I'll see you guys August 5th.  Yeah, Bob, a new friend of the show.  It's a pleasure, man.  You do some great stuff for us.  I dig you guys a lot, and I really appreciate it.  See you soon, buddy.  Thanks, Bob.  I'll see you later.  See you, man.  All right.  There he goes.  Bob Saget.  He's part of the O&A Traveling Virus.  Bob Saget.  He's doing three dates.  All the info is on opiananthony.com. 
[04:01:30]  Take us through ticketmaster.com.  The first show, it's right around the corner now, August 5th, at the DCU Center in Worcester.  He's supposed to be a really funny stand-up.  Everyone just seems to be really funny.  And the beautiful thing about Saget, he spent the last X amount of years just destroying  that wholesome image.  It's like, how do you not love that?  That is the best part.  And it's so obvious to everybody that he's doing that.  But it's like, you get so many phonies in Hollywood that are on these shows, and they  have this persona, and never want it damaged or tainted.  He just goes on and talks about fucking the kids. 
[04:02:00]  There's three guys in the house fucking the children.  He's made his money, now he's fucking enjoying it.  How do you not love that?  That is hysterical.  And you heard for years that he was really dirty, and you would always go, no, come on.  I hate them growing up.  I didn't know he was like a great comic and this funny dude.  When he sits on the edge of one of those beds in like the girls' room and gives them  that, hey, just because the kids are making fun of you at school doesn't mean you're not  a special kid.  But it's just this drivel coming out of his mouth. 
[04:02:30]  And you know that he is one of the most horrid individuals when it comes to making jokes.  He's probably like, all right, cut.  All right, kid, get the fuck out of here.  Suck my cock.  Right, right.  Beat it.  Beat it, little whore.  Let's go to Greg, Oklahoma City.  Greg.  What's up, guys?  Welcome aboard.  Jimmy, you had a line you got stepped on.  It was funny as hell.  I'm earthy when you were talking about getting pissed on.  Oh, thank you.  I'm very nice.  I said I was earthy.  I'm earthy.  All right, Mr. Old's been waiting for hours.  Mr. Old. 
[04:03:00]  Oh, Mr. Old.  From Long Island, the guy that shot his gun and got us in the paper.  Page three.  Hi, doll face.  What's up, Mr. Old?  Hey, that killer.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, um, Mr. Town is the man, by the way, and, uh, Jimmy, Ozzy Osbourne is a butter ass.  He stinks.  Led Zeppelin started metal.  Really?  Then why is, dude, why is Sabbath the universally acknowledged?  Led Zeppelin was great, dude, but they didn't start heavy metal.  That's not, it's just not.  It's just not.  Off a centauri, they're saying. 
[04:03:30]  Led Zeppelin was the first super group.  No, I'm fucking kidding, because Pink Floyd and Black Sabbath was my favorite band.  The definition of super group, they, members come from other bands.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  All right, that's fair enough.  What about, what about Floyd, dude?  All right, Floyd and Sabbath and my favorite band.  The New York birds, if you will.  Herman's Hermits, I'll tell you right now, started it all.  All right.  Mr. Old, what do you want?  No, I was just saying thank you for the tickets.  Oh, yeah, you got OzFest tickets, right?  Oh, nice, man.  Good, good.  All right, Mr. Old, thank you. 
[04:04:00]  Thank you, sweetie.  We've got to cut it short, because we've got to get out of here.  Is Steve around?  I think we have OzFest tickets to give away.  Yes.  Because we're on for another hour.  You know, Steve?  Yeah.  We got OzFest tickets?  We certainly do.  Which ones should we give away today?  We gave away the New York ones.  How about, wow, why is that?  Oh, that.  Okay.  We could give away Rochester.  Could we?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, we can't?  Why not?  But we can.  Can we give away Rochester?  We certainly can.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Rochester? 
[04:04:30]  Yes, we have five pairs to give away in Rochester.  No, nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  We'll handle it.  They're playing Darien Lake, probably?  Darien Lake Performing Arts Center.  All right, see, because I did some radio up there.  That's kind of in between Rochester and Buffalo, so.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  If you're in the Buffalo area or the Rochester area, or you can just get to Darien Lake.  When's the show?  July 27th.  July 27th, we got five pairs of tickets to Ozfest.  Nice.  Thanks to Jägermeister, right?  Thanks to Ozfest and Jägermeister, yes.  Beautiful.  Oh, my God, the way he brutalizes that mic, it sounds like an earthquake is going on in 
[04:05:00]  here.  Yeah.  Sorry.  All right.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  So, Travis will work the phones.  But seriously, if you're not going to use these tickets, don't bother calling.  Save them for somebody else.  Grr.  All right?  Grr.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  We forgive you, Steve.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  Hey, hey.  This is our studio.  Get the fuck out.  Now.  Oh, no. 
[04:05:30]  You leave.  Get the fuck out.  Now.  Could we go?  How would you comfort a woman if she wanted to help?  How would I?  I don't know.  Grr.  Grr.  Let's leave with a buttery beat.  Why not?  What?  Buttery beat.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not? 
[04:06:00]  Why not?  Why not?  Grr.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Grr.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Get the fuck out.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Get the fuck out.  Grr.  Grr.
