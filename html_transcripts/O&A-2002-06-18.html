<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a celebratory discussion of their high Philadelphia ratings, immediately transitioning to a segment featuring guest Jim Norton.  The hosts reviewed a nine-year-old stand-up tape of Norton, analyzing his comedic evolution and surprisingly consistent physique.  The tape showcased an awkward encounter with a bachelorette party and a peculiar "wacky walk," as well as a now-infamous enema joke.  This was intercut with live commentary on a televised police chase, contrasting California and Texas law enforcement responses, and a digression into the disproportionate media attention given to missing white children.  They also covered a plane crash, detailing graphic damage, the Denver forest fires (blamed on a Forest Service employee burning a letter), and alleged arson by volunteer firefighters.  Listener calls from Perry, Bob, Chris, and Tony contributed to the discussions surrounding the car chase, missing children, and news coverage.  A segment involved a contentious but humorous exchange with Pugs and Kelly, rival Dallas radio hosts, focused mainly on the Opie and Anthony WOW contest, featuring a particularly discussed entrant, "Gemini" from Philadelphia, whose gender was ambiguous.  Further calls from Steve (detailing a Long Island firehouse arson) and Tim (with updates on the car chase) were interspersed with additional discussion of the WOW contest, including calls from Sabrina (Columbus, Ohio) and Steve (Sacramento, who detailed a barge sinking incident at a radio station party).  The segment concluded with a live interview with Kayla, a WOW contest entrant, and more commentary on the chase and the contest, with humorous analysis of contestant photos and reminiscing about past, often boob-themed contests.

The next segment began with a comparison of the repetitive police chase to *The Flintstones*, sparking a debate about classic cartoons, particularly the hosts’ vehement dislike of *Scooby-Doo*.  This transitioned abruptly to a call from "Dippy Tom," a homeless, Hepatitis C-positive gay man, who made sexually explicit and offensive remarks.  The conversation veered to a supposed Jennifer Lopez sex tape, followed by further criticism of the *Scooby-Doo* movie.  This led to a discussion of the Katie Beers kidnapping case, including details of the perpetrator and his parole.  Listener calls, including one from Seattle where the show didn't air the previous night, and further comments on the *Scooby-Doo* movie followed.  The "F.U." segment allowed listeners to leave angry and offensive messages.  The segment ended with Jim Norton's angry and self-deprecating rant about his technological frustrations, self-loathing, and suicidal ideation, interspersed with discussions of a tasteless Starbucks advertisement and a strip club's insensitive use of 9/11 imagery;  this included anecdotes about his therapist and an incident involving hot chocolate.  The hosts then took a snack break.

The third segment opened with discussions of AOL email spamming and a shirtless photo of Mike Piazza, with jokes about its homoerotic implications.  Julie called to share her weight loss success, inspired by Norton's past discussions. Norton then discussed his own body image issues, focusing on his physique.  Devita, Julie’s mother, called in with sarcastic comments. A clinical hypnotherapist, Steven, clarified the differences between his practice and stage hypnotism.  The hosts promoted the WOW contest, showcasing photos, and Opie recounted an unpleasant taxi experience. Dylan defined "ectomorphic" for Norton, and Lady Di engaged in a lengthy and combative exchange with the hosts about her refusal to participate in a pre-planned comedic bit involving a mustache. The argument devolved into insults about her clothing, intelligence, and comparisons to other personalities.  A listener poll on whether Lady Di should remain on the show dominated the remaining time, with debate over her suitability and comedic potential.  The segment ended with jokes at Lady Di's expense and a brief clip of Frenchy and Dice arguing.

The final segment began with homophobic slurs towards an unidentified individual.  It focused heavily on the WOW contest, showcasing entries from Dallas, Philly, and D.C., sponsored by riskgatevideo.com. Numerous crude and humorous listener calls, discussions of Led Zeppelin's "Moby Dick," and listener feedback ("what they learned today") followed.  The car chase was discussed again, noting Jim Norton's unusually affectionate behavior.  Another listener vote on Lady Di's continued presence resulted in a close vote to keep her. The show concluded with jokes, banter, and an admission that they significantly overran their allotted time.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello.  You're going to give children AIDS?  You don't die of AIDS!  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Philly.  Philly.  Holy S.  Ah, Philly. 
[00:00:30]  Philly, stop liking the show so much.  You're making us nervous, man.  Isn't that great?  That means you expect something from us every day.  Relax.  Relax with the liking of the show, my God.  How great is Philly, man.  Philly rocks.  God damn.  We're going to have to go back and visit them very, very soon, Anthony.  Ratings trend came out for Philly, and we're just destroying, crushing, killing the competition.  So, thank you, Philly.  The first city that syndicated the O.P. and Anthony Show.  And it looked like it was a good idea, right? 
[00:01:00]  It certainly does.  So, for Philly and anyone else outside of New York City, 866-277-4.  Wow.  In the studio today, it's Anthony, and, of course, Jim Norton.  I can't even look at him, Anthony.  I know.  It's a little embarrassing, Jim.  We're going to see if we can get that on the radio.  I don't know.  The audio's a little bad.  But Jim Norton brought in a tape of himself doing stand-up eight years ago, or nine years  ago.  Nine years ago.  Nine years ago. 
[00:01:30]  One of his early efforts as a stand-up comic.  The man now, I will say, one of the funniest comics out there.  Very funny.  Jim Norton.  But, boy, you sure came a long way.  Oh, I was awful.  He was...  I don't know what it was.  We pop the tape in.  He runs out of the office.  So, we're watching.  And there comes a guy out who looks like Jimmy.  And he starts...  It looks exactly like Jimmy.  Jimmy's been bitching and complaining about his body. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  I just told him, why bother?  You had the same body nine years ago.  What's the difference?  Yeah, I was 25 years old with the same.  You make it sound like 25, you had the washboard abs, and you were in good shape, and something  happened along the way.  Yeah.  Dude, you were as awful at 25 as you are now.  I know.  I understand that.  I'm not saying I haven't been a consistent disaster.  I've never been happy with it.  Same hair?  Yeah.  You were maybe a tiny bit thinner in the face.  That's about it.  Still no chin?  No.  No chin, no hair, and same awful body. 
[00:02:30]  I never claimed that I looked like Van Damme when I started comedy.  Why do you think I started it?  But yesterday after the show, you're stressing about how awful your body is.  And now I look at this tape, I'm like, give it up.  Yeah.  You've had the same body for at least nine years, maybe longer.  No, for 33 years.  Anyway, sorry, Anthony.  The, um, so, yeah, out comes a guy who looks like Jimmy.  Like, all right.  And then he opens his mouth.  The first thing you will notice is that I don't know whose voice that is. 
[00:03:00]  He put on, he used to put on a voice that I can only compare to Urkel from, uh, whatever  series that was.  Hey, it's Urkel, everybody.  I got a chubby little fat face.  Look at me.  When I walked into the office, I, because I did, too, a friend of mine stopped by, so,  uh, she and I walked out, because I couldn't watch the tape.  You handed us the tape and ran out.  Yeah.  And I walked back in, like, ten minutes later, and they both looked at me like you'd look 
[00:03:30]  at a rape victim, like that, like, like that, we know you're dirty.  Yeah, we know.  We understand.  But, oh, I don't know how to look at you.  It was disgust.  Yeah.  Well, at one point, I go, uh, Rick, um, just turn it off.  Yeah.  Just turn it off.  It went from being fun because it was so awful to just being...  Just awful.  ...being awkward and uncomfortable for everybody.  And it went...  You know what else he was doing that I just found I was cringing? 
[00:04:00]  Is, uh...  He was a lot more animated.  And there was one point where I guess he's working the crowd a little bit.  Working the crowd a little.  Asking people what they were doing.  And one of the girls goes, you know, oh, a bachelorette party.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he goes, oh, you know, some girls get Chippendales, you get me.  And he proceeds to put on his face and do a wacky walk. 
[00:04:30]  I think it was a...  He did a wacky walk across the stage toward the girl.  It was that Martin Short character, Ed Grimley, or...  You had, like, an Ed Grimley thing going on.  That could be the worst moment I've ever had on stage, that moment.  And the crowd was laughing and enjoying it, which shows you how stupid audiences were.  Oh, Rick goes, well, at least they'll laugh.  And I go, Carrot Top gets laughs.  Stop it.  Dude, I was so awful.  And then I missed the end part, which you brought up.  Because did you see the end part with the, what is it, douche?  No, that was the entire performance. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, oh.  The end part was the enema.  An enema.  Same thing.  Same thing.  Only a douche is what an enema was yesterday.  And you had a Zubar pair of pants on.  Zubar pants.  So, what happened was this.  When I started, I used to get, like, groaned at and bomb-a-locked.  So, I was too mean and too dirty.  Yeah.  When I started, and then I just, I don't know how it developed into that high-energy,  please like me nonsense.  Yeah, that's all I saw was, like, a guy craving attention and please like me. 
[00:05:30]  That's what makes you so sick when you watch it.  It's like, wow, the desperation and need of their approval is so obvious.  Hold on, guys.  Breaking news.  Jared.  Yes, sir.  What's up, Jared?  What's going on, guys?  It's the Chase on Fox News channel.  He eats the heroes.  What's up, Jared?  What's going on?  There's a Chase on Fox News channel right now.  What?  Just alerting you to the fun.  We're on it.  All right, then.  Thank you, Jared.  Thank you, guys.  Police chasing Honda in California.  Honda in California. 
[00:06:00]  Okay.  Let me tell you something.  No.  Yeah, he's on a one, two, three.  It looks like a four-lane highway near Cerritos, California.  Cerritos.  And let me tell you something, Anthony.  The last car chase we had was out of Texas.  Oh, it ended fab.  And we said it was on our show.  The police in Texas rocked so much more than the police in California.  They were right on the guy's ass.  They forced this guy basically to kill himself.  Yeah, he...  The last one.  He hit a piling for a bridge, big cement piling, and just destroyed the truck. 
[00:06:30]  He went flying.  And they pulled his lifeless body out of the truck.  Yeah.  And then they were claiming that the guy was okay, but there was no way that guy was okay.  This guy doesn't really seem to be moving.  And look at where the cops are.  Yeah, the cop is just kind of...  Faggy California cop.  Lollygagging behind him.  They're so far behind.  I'm in a high-speed pursuit.  One, two, three...  Yeah, like a four-lane highway.  Yeah.  Not much going on here.  He's about to pass a van.  The van's got to be going about 65, so he's barely going 70. 
[00:07:00]  Jeez, Fox is getting off of the kidnapped girl story.  Finally.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  And that lady that reads the news on Fox, she looks like a robot.  Her eyes, she does not blink.  They're so big.  She does not blink.  On Fox News, her eyes get huge.  And I was saying, I just can't wait until the day she loses it and just starts cursing that she doesn't want to do this S anymore.  Just loses her mind.  I'll laugh my ass off.  Isn't it amazing that story about the kidnapped kid is just... 
[00:07:30]  And it's the same thing with the JonBenet Ramsey story.  We, as Americans, and Earl, you'll probably back me up on this one.  If it was a black kid that was kidnapped or missing, do you honestly think it would get this much attention?  No.  Mexican kid, maybe?  Not a lot.  Yeah, a little Chinese kid.  And we love when little, white, blonde kids get kidnapped because they do not stop with the coverage. 
[00:08:00]  And it pulls at our heartstrings.  They love it.  It's like, you know, America's Most Wanted does stories on it.  How many kids just disappear every day?  It's amazing.  But if they fit the mold of what people want to see, you know, oh, the little blonde kid, you know, and it's just pounded on the news.  I'm watching, but I know enough.  That's a good observation.  Enough.  I'm just so glad they got a car chase on Fox because I was so sick of seeing the footage of that airplane clapping. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Have you shown footage of that?  With the wings clapping.  Dude, where?  Dude, I was trying to get my stupid computer back online all day.  I give up.  I give up on you.  No, no, I was doing...  You did not see the footage of the plane going down with the wings just being ripped off the damn thing?  No, you perfect angel.  I didn't.  They've shown the footage at least a hundred times since we've been in the back office.  You know why I wasn't watching TV?  They're showing it every 15 to 20 seconds.  I was doing something.  My TiVo's not working.  Neither is my stupid...  I'm a technological disaster.  Nothing is working.  It just looked like the wings decided to clap. 
[00:09:00]  Just went, time to clap.  Yeah, both wings just kind of came off.  And then you've got to think the pilot was just like, oh, man.  Well, because then the fuselage without the wings on it goes into a roll.  Yeah.  And you know the pilot's like, let me try to straight miss out, not knowing he has no wings.  Looks behind him and sees no wings.  There's just cables kind of pulling at the air.  Nothing there left.  Fluttering in the wind.  Wait, that's where my wings used to be.  And you've got to think he's hoping that he could just kind of slide down the mountain. 
[00:09:30]  Slide down.  At one point, but...  That came down right on the cockpit.  Yeah, just crashed right into the mountain.  Horrible.  Oh, sick footage, though.  You haven't seen it?  No.  Like a firefighting plane, one of those water tanker planes.  I've seen the photos, yeah.  For the Denver forest fires that are going on?  I've got to tell you something.  Do you hear how those started?  Yep.  It was a Forest Service employee, a woman, who had just set fire to a letter she had gotten  from her estranged husband.  That's it?  Yeah.  And she threw it to the side, and there you go. 
[00:10:00]  And that's what you get.  Now there's planes down, people dead, huge amounts of forest.  Forest gone, houses gone, because she's, you know, burning up a letter from her husband.  I would think there's going to be a big fire in New York City when a 1993 comedy tape was  set on fire in a dumpster.  I don't believe her story, by the way.  I don't believe that.  No?  No.  I think it sounds right, but I don't believe it, because she had to justify it somehow.  You think maybe she wanted to be the one that phones in the fire and gets a little recognition? 
[00:10:30]  That happens a lot.  Yeah.  With firefighters, not so much paid firefighters, like, you know, in New York City here, the  fire department, but volunteer fire departments, they've got a lot of those out of Long Island.  It's amazing.  Because, you know, who's really going to join?  You've got a lot of people that are pretty up for the cause, and they're there for community  and everything, but some of these people, they join because they like fire.  They enjoy looking at fire.  And there's been many cases out of Long Island especially where guys start fires just so 
[00:11:00]  they could be the hero and put it out.  And sometimes, oops, didn't get it quick enough, someone's dead, and then they end up going  to prison.  I thought I was pathetic starting rapes and then leaving and coming back dressed differently  and saving them.  I'll save you.  You idiot.  Now make love to me.  Hey, let's go to Perry.  Your pants are already off.  We're watching this car chase in California.  Now they're on like a three, four, five, like a six or seven lane highway, and not much  is going on.  The Honda's just kind of weaving in and out of traffic. 
[00:11:30]  Not driving really recklessly yet.  Perry, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Oh, he's exiting the highway.  This is where it always gets good.  Go ahead, Perry.  No, I was watching on CNN this morning.  They said 2,000 kids are reported missing every day to the FBI.  Every day.  Well, most of that is just either run away or something.  My kid's missing, and he's around the corner at his friend's house.  They're a legitimate missing kid, though, but, you know, we just love looking at the  little blonde kids.  I tell you, that's the thing. 
[00:12:00]  I mean, I have two kids, and I'd probably go berserk if that happened to me, but, you  know, I mean, you want to help them, but it gets crazy after a while.  I'll be sure to tell Wheezy you guys say hello.  Wheezy?  Yeah, I'm going to see him in a couple of weeks.  All right, cool.  Our man up there, his wife is my wife's best friend.  All right.  I don't know if that's good or bad.  All right, Perry, thank you.  As he chuckles, nervous titter.  Bob, you're next on Opie and Anthony.  First of all, about this police chase?  Yeah.  Where are the police?  The people in the left lane are going faster than this guy. 
[00:12:30]  We told you, the police in California, they're a bunch of police.  It tends to get right up on the guy's ass.  Yeah, and there's the reason I'm calling.  See the giant graphics?  Am I the only one that hates that on Fox News?  When you go to camera aiming school, do they teach you to center the picture in the middle  of the frame?  Or do they say, oh, no, put it in the upper right-hand corner in case it's on Fox News?  Right.  They center the action.  There's a quarter of the screen gone.  Quarter of the screen gone with their big Fox stupid news graphic.  They leave a quarter of the screen behind.  Fox's whole job is to scare the crap out of you. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, I get the crap right on the couch.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  All right.  Bye.  We bash Fox all the time, yet it's all we watch.  Of course.  Let's be real.  All this crap happens right before showtime.  So we sit in there and hope he's going to have a nervous breakdown.  Hostage situations, car chases, earthquakes.  Earthquakes today.  Illinois or wherever.  And earthquakes in Kentucky today.  Chris, what's going on?  Rocket attacks.  Oh, and A, you guys rock.  All right. 
[00:13:30]  Question.  What awards did you win last night?  What?  Which awards were given out?  I don't know.  For the Radio and Records Awards.  Oh, the R&R Award.  Last year, we won Air Personality of the Year for the whole country.  Yeah.  Well, this year, they put us in the really tough category.  Yeah.  We got killed by everybody.  You guys should have won.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Okay.  We've been doing it a year.  He's been doing it, what, 16, 17 years?  Who else was in there?  Rush?  Rush Limbaugh.  Yeah, that.  And a few others.  It's stiff competition, you know. 
[00:14:00]  They put us in the brutal category.  Oh, he's in traffic, yeah.  All right, he's in traffic, Chris.  We got to go.  They screwed, you guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Now, they put us in the syndicated...  Everyone knows it was a fix, yeah.  Radio show.  Look at him go.  He's going to go.  Aw, aw, aw.  All right, this guy is screwed, because now he's in some kind of bumper-to-bumper traffic.  He's in some traffic.  He's making some really good moves, but he's getting very lucky.  The Honda weaving in and out.  He's in the granny lane now.  He's getting very lucky.  Which is moving faster than all the other lanes.  Yeah, what the hell's happening there?  All the rest of these cars, they're stupid, because look, there's people moving out of 
[00:14:30]  his way.  This lane is completely clear.  No one else is using it.  They'd rather be stuck in the other lanes of traffic.  I'd have followed that guy.  Wow, this is really getting good, because now he's getting into some traffic.  Now it's open road again.  He's armed parolee.  What happened?  Huh?  Son of a...  Oh, the cop's getting a little closer to him, though.  Nah.  Not like Texas, man.  Yeah, L.A.  Texas would be right on his ass.  You suck, L.A. 
[00:15:00]  Tony, what's going on?  You're not on there, so it doesn't matter.  Boys, you know, I've got to tell you, I'm not really buying a little white kid thing.  I've got two words for you.  Elian Gonzalez.  Different story.  That had political implications.  It wasn't just a missing kid.  Yeah, you had people camping outside the house and all that.  Had him coming over on a fishing bopper.  And his mom died on the way over.  Wrote a tuna fish sandwich over from Cuba.  Yeah.  Hey, Chimpy.  What?  Maybe I want you to go upstairs and take a shower and make it a good shower, because I've 
[00:15:30]  got to come up and see how clean you are.  Right.  You keep your mouth shut or I'll beat you like I do, huh?  That is really good.  We're going to have to get that.  We've got to get that clip for the show.  Some natural-born killer, man.  See you, boys.  Very good, buddy.  Take it easy, man.  All right, let's go to Steve.  We're kind of all over the place as we follow this car chase.  We love following the car chases.  Honda just taken off and so far nothing to report.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing? 
[00:16:00]  You talking about those volunteer firemen before?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know a guy who said his own...  I'm not going to say what the problem it was.  It was on Long Island.  He said his own firehouse on a fire.  Twice.  And was he the guy that put it out?  Or did he alert everybody?  He hung out there at night and stuff.  And then later on, he wanted to be the guy who called it in.  Yeah.  Some of the guys were complaining about the firehouse.  I think his thing was he wanted a new firehouse.  Well, that happens.  He just burned it down.  With some of these guys.  You know, especially there's an abandoned shack or something like that. 
[00:16:30]  They'll scope it out and go, we haven't had a good fire in a while.  I'll torch this thing up.  Yeah, abandoned shack's one thing.  Your own firehouse.  You know, and sometimes...  The old guys hang out.  They all drink their beers there.  You know, something like that.  Oh, I used to do jobs.  You know, air conditioning jobs at some of the firehouses down on Long Island.  Their bar areas rival any club you could go to.  The beers.  The beers.  Yeah.  And they would just, you know, sit.  And so would I.  I wasn't working either.  You know, I was supposed to be.  I'm sitting at the bar. 
[00:17:00]  Nice big screen TV.  We're watching the game.  We're drinking beer.  And I'm like, I'm in a firehouse.  What the hell is that?  Big screen TV.  It's great over there.  A lot of downtime.  He's got the whole thing on fire.  Oh, yeah.  He's got to pre-built the whole thing, probably.  I see.  I'm not faulting him.  I think we're going to try to burn down the radio station here in New York and get  a whole new one.  There you go.  You think we're going to do it without them knowing it's us?  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, I hope you'll come in at night.  Torch it up.  We'll warn Ron and Fez.  That's about it.  Tim, what's going on? 
[00:17:30]  Hey, how you doing, boys?  All right, Tim.  All right, I got word on that car chase.  They're saying that he's an escaped convict and he's armed and dangerous.  Dude, he is armed.  Police chasing, they changed the graphic.  Now they're saying it's a police chased armed parolee near Whittier, California.  Yeah, they just changed the graphic.  But he's armed.  Now, I saw something sticking out the back window.  I was wondering if that was a shotgun, if there's someone else.  Is this more traffic?  It actually looked like an arm or maybe a leg or something.  No, it's being reported it's lumber by our reporter on the scene, Jim Norton. 
[00:18:00]  All right, thank you, bro.  All right, thank you, Tim.  You're doing it.  Dude, how much pot have you smoked today?  Now?  Yeah.  Well, I'm working on that now.  All right, thank you, Tim.  It looks like the cops are clear on that lane.  Is that what they're doing?  Because I see traffic in the other two lanes.  Is there a cop in front of this guy?  Just look at this guy.  If you're right next to him, don't you just drive him into the barrier? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, you've got to knock the back end of his farm.  I would.  Have a little fun.  Here's your 15 minutes.  Put the guy right into that guardrail.  It would be fantastic.  The guy's armed.  Now we might have to stick with this.  Who cares?  I'd kill him anyway.  I thought it was just one of those regular car chases.  It better end violently and with death.  Because I don't want to see a 20-minute standoff with this guy.  Put the gun down, blah, blah, blah.  He's back in the car.  No, he's back out. 
[00:19:00]  I want to see that car end up into the rail in flames.  Maybe with the guy.  Remember, you used to watch the fall guy?  And they'd have the guy get out of the vehicle on fire.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's like, wow, it sure looks like a guy that's in a huge, heavy, fiery suit.  They never made that gag look good.  I mean, they just recently started making that look kind of good because I think they use CGI.  But it used to be, you know, you'd see like a woman.  Yeah.  A little frail woman is driving a car.  It bursts into flames. 
[00:19:30]  All of a sudden, the incredible Hulk is outside the car doing the I'm on fire walk.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  It's like, wow, he's got a big square head.  These big bulbous legs and all.  He can't even move.  It's like in one of those dog training suits that's on fire.  Ah!  It's like crap.  That's classic.  All right.  And we'll take a break.  That sucks.  We're going to try to time this thing with the car chase in California with the guy that's armed.  Yeah, right.  So stay there.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:20:00]  Here, check it out, the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're following the car chase on Fox.  Yeah, it's still going.  Because that's what we do.  They're chasing a Honda.  The guy is armed and dangerous in the Honda.  Yeah.  Matt from Bay Ridge writes, I had that same type of Honda Civic, 1982, I think.  That thing can't do 80 going downhill with a back wind.  Guy's waving at the copter, it looked like, for a second there.  Well, we timed it perfectly.  We were able to do some commercials and get right back to the car chase. 
[00:20:30]  Also, Pugs and Kelly, they're doing a show in Dallas.  They're way before us in Dallas, actually, Anthony.  And they want to talk to us today on the radio as well.  All right.  I don't know if they're there yet.  Pugs, Kelly.  We're here.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, O&A.  How are you guys doing?  What's up?  Pretty good.  We didn't do any show prep today, so we're just going to watch TV and describe what's going on on the TV.  Wait a minute, Bobby put it up.  It should be about two of the same shows.  Guys, are we watching the same thing?  Car chase somewhere in California? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, car chase, the guy's armed and dangerous.  We were explaining earlier that the cops in the Texas area are so much more aggressive when it comes to these car chases.  Did you see the one like two weeks ago?  Yes.  Yes, we did.  Wait, was that the one with the burning lumber truck?  Is that what you're talking about?  No, that one was really good.  This one was a pickup truck, and it slammed into a big piling for a highway.  Uh-huh.  And, yeah, the cops just dragged the guy out and threw him on the ground.  It was great, though.  It looked like he was dead, and they still handcuffed the guy. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Wasn't that the morning guy that got killed here?  See, we had these every day.  Yeah, guys, you know, we get down a lot down here.  The pickup truck driver's slamming into things, yeah.  We had a morning guy who had a, like, a tractor that was on the back of a flatbed fall on his car as he went under a viaduct a couple months ago.  Really?  Killed him, yeah.  Yeah, very sad.  They killed the morning guy?  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  Jesus.  Ironically, on a station called Memories.  Wow.  We need that same trick to happen around here. 
[00:22:00]  First of all, hey, guys, congratulations on the promotion.  We've been big fans of you guys since, well, since you first started.  Yeah, you guys have been emailing us ever since we started in Dallas, and we appreciate the support.  And the station moved us down to 7 o'clock.  We're very happy.  Yeah, I'll do that.  That's right.  Should be a lot easier for us.  We're hoping.  Right.  Guys, help us out here.  We're doing this wow thing that you guys do, you know?  We're trying to send girls from Dallas to enter the contest.  Yeah.  We haven't a clue. 
[00:22:30]  First of all, what are you guys, just taking all comers?  You see some of those girls on there?  What the fuck are you guys from Chicago?  All right, listen.  Step run is a beast.  Hey, we can all make fun of the girl from Chicago.  You know, you've got to have faith in Opie and Anthony.  These contests always start really slow with a bunch of pigs and messes.  But by the end of it, they're all a bunch of Playboy models.  Yeah.  I believe it.  I think all the real professionals, they kind of wait and see what ends up at the stations,  and then they finally go, okay, it's time for me to enter the contest. 
[00:23:00]  Chippers are late for everything.  You see the one girl that we're not sure is a girl?  Wait, no.  Which one?  Wait, pull it up.  Can we pull it up?  Yeah, what city?  Is she one of the Philly broads?  Because they all look like biker mess.  Yeah, they do.  Oh, now you're messing with Philly on us.  Oh, oh, oh.  Come on.  Seriously.  Put it this way.  You won't even have to ask us which one it is.  Okay.  It's that obvious.  Yeah, why don't you pull up the contestants on opanthony.com.  It's the WOW Contest.  You want to explain the WOW Contest?  Say it real fast.  Yeah, girls, just go down to any of the studios you hear our fine show on, 
[00:23:30]  and you get your picture taken flashing, giving your best WOW.  And then we put it up on the website,  and the listeners get to vote.  Eventually, because it's going to take a while to qualify,  get all the qualifiers in this contest.  And then risquevideo.com has given away the $5,000.  Five grand.  So I think what happens is a lot of the girls,  the attractive girls, kind of look at the pictures and go,  hey, five grand is up for gramps?  And then they look at these girls and go,  oh, I could beat that. 
[00:24:00]  All right, so which one are we talking about, guys?  Yeah, which one?  I'm trying to find her.  All right, looking for the one that looks like she's halfway through a sex change operation.  Yeah, it is.  Is it Gemini?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  Gemini in Philly.  That's true.  She looks like she played bass in Rack.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  Look at the mitts on her.  Yeah.  She's got really big man hands.  Yeah.  And I don't know.  The guys in Philly swear that she's a lady. 
[00:24:30]  But our listeners, you know, this came from our listeners.  We got a lot of email in.  They're like, come on, guys.  That's a dude.  I know.  And they're begging us to get that person out of the contest.  Oh, we can't do that.  You've got to start with the one that looks like my mom from Chicago.  That's just frightening.  Hey, at least Chicago's representing Dallas.  We started that one today.  Yeah.  And was she hot?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Have you?  First of all, guys, I'm sure you've heard tale of the Texas women.  Come on.  Go through any Playboy you have in a box in your garage. 
[00:25:00]  You will find girls from small towns in Texas in every issue of Playboy.  We have the most beautiful women in the world here in Dallas.  It's the strip club capital.  We have 105 strip clubs.  Oh, my God.  And unfortunately, you know, we've only got a couple.  It's starting slow, but they're starting to come in.  That's what happens.  I guarantee you a Dallas victory in this contest.  Oh, look at you.  Look at you.  I guarantee you.  Well, hopefully we've got the pictures and we'll get them up on opianthony.com later on  today, I guess.  Okay.  When does this contest end? 
[00:25:30]  When we feel like we've got enough quality in the contest.  Right now.  It's going to go for a while.  Your CD has thrown in $500 for the best Dallas entrance.  Yeah.  Oh.  At this point, I think the contest is going until October.  Yeah.  And the winner gets $5,000 and a topless ride through Jilly Plaza.  Where we will shoot paint guns.  That's right.  All right.  So what are you guys doing on your show today?  Well, it's almost over, right?  Well, we're just about done. 
[00:26:00]  We've been watching TV.  We've played a game that failed miserably.  Yeah.  What game did you guys play?  Don't tell me you guys did the Battle of the Sexes game.  No.  No.  Come on.  All right.  Come on.  We're just feeling you guys out.  I mean, if you guys do that Battle of the Sexes thing, we can't talk to you anymore.  No, we don't do that.  They're listening to us.  They think we're like a mixed morning show or something.  No.  Hit the Maxbox 20.  Let's go.  We don't know for sure.  All right.  What game did you guys play today? 
[00:26:30]  No, we don't want to talk about it.  It was a whammy game.  It was really complicated.  It was like a combination of pressure, luck, and just total train wreck.  I remember that show.  It was horrible.  Yeah.  It was horrible.  You've got to make your contest very simple, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There you go.  It was our producer's contest.  Bobby, talk to a couple of big timers.  Bobby created this game.  Radio contests are supposed to be very simple.  All right.  Bobby.  Haven't the consultants told you guys that yet?  My PD came right in and told me right after that.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  It makes no sense.  When the hosts of the show don't understand how it works.  Yeah.  And we are the lowest common denominator.  Don't we have a girl that's supposed to be here right now?  Supposedly, yeah.  A beautiful young girl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, blonde.  Yeah, sure.  Texas.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's great.  Send the pictures, man.  Send the pictures, all right?  We will.  Absolutely.  And where can we access the people listening?  That's opiandamphony.com?  Yeah.  Yeah, the contestants are up there right now, and I guess the rules for the contest as well.  Mm-hmm.  It's got to be a simple, simple thing, like our most, the wackiest thing you could do in 
[00:27:30]  the bathroom contest we held, that Andrea Yates won.  We still got to do the Smell My Buzz contest, bud, which you won't do.  Yeah, Smell My Buzz.  Hey, that chick from Sacramento is pretty good, though.  Yeah.  Well, they got a bunch of ringers in Sacramento.  They do?  Yes.  Hey, did you hear about that midday show in Sacramento that sunk the boat?  What do they do?  The midday show on your station out there in Sacramento, they threw a party on a barge. 
[00:28:00]  It was like some restaurant bar.  Yeah, a restaurant that's on a barge, and they had three other listeners, and it started  to sink.  That's great.  That's infinity money right there, baby.  That's the Leon Klinghofer contest.  What a great event.  Come on, some of you listeners.  Hold on.  Sabrina wants in on this.  Hold on a second.  Sabrina.  Yes.  We're talking to Dallas.  What do you got for that?  Oh, there is no way the winner's going to come from Dallas.  How can you say that?  Oh, no way. 
[00:28:30]  Where's it coming from?  I'm going to be up tomorrow representing Columbus, Ohio.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  You ever been to Ohio, guys?  Oh, my God.  Oh, give me a break.  I'll bring you a couple of my girls.  We love Ohio.  We love Ohio.  Songs about the women coming out of Ohio.  Oh, beautiful.  Yeah.  And the songs about them.  I'm going to be behind hot.  Yeah.  I can't name one hot chick from Ohio.  Well, first of all...  Sabrina, that's who.  First of all, Columbus hasn't represented in the contest, and Dallas hasn't represented  yet.  No.  So, both of you guys got to shut your trap. 
[00:29:00]  No, I'm going up at 8.30 in the morning, me and a couple of my friends.  All right.  At 9.30 hot chick time.  All right.  We look forward to your pictures, Sabrina.  All right.  Thanks.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye.  And then Cleveland, we're having a tough time with Cleveland.  The radio station won't let the girls get naked.  What?  Are you kidding me?  Not the actual station, but the building they're in.  I guess it's a bunch of hard asses, so they don't want any nudity on the premises.  So, now Cleveland, I think, has figured out like a bar.  Really?  Where the girls can go down and get their pictures taken. 
[00:29:30]  Are there any bathrooms in that building?  I know.  They should be able to figure it out.  They go to the bathroom if they can't get naked.  But, yeah, so they're really bummed in Cleveland.  The bar will be great.  I'm looking forward to the pose on the pinball table with five guys around.  Guys, question about the rules.  Is that all right?  Do they have to come up to the studio?  Because we were thinking of taking one out to like South Fork and putting one in Dealey  Plaza, you know, Texas Stadium.  We wanted to do all the, with the bullet hole in their head and everything.  We wanted to have the makeup artists come in and, you know, take the back of our head 
[00:30:00]  off.  Well, if you guys are taking the pictures, that's fine.  I guess it doesn't matter where the hell they came from.  Yeah, you just got to be able to prove that they're, you know, 18 or whatever.  The only real stipulation is if she's had a mastectomy, she's only eligible for 2,500.  You're just horrid.  Hey, we've got to get one of those.  We've got any of those down here in Texas?  We've got to get one of those.  We've got to get one of those funny guys.  If you sit around, we need that.  Oh, okay.  All right, guys. 
[00:30:30]  We've got to wrap up the news.  Thank you so much for talking to us.  We really are big fans and we wish you all the luck in the world.  Wait, what are you guys doing now?  Well, we've got an afternoon guy who will kick our ass if we go one minute over.  I want to hear you guys do some news.  That's like four minutes more that we don't have to do.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  A New Zealand city councilor has suggested eating cats to control the numbers.  This idea came when the Nelson city councilor was considering whether or not to start registering 
[00:31:00]  cats as a way of protecting them.  So now she's saying people eat dogs.  Why not just let them eat cats?  What people eat dogs?  The Chinese and the Japanese.  Are we aiming at that level?  Well, no.  This is in New Zealand.  But she said no.  Oh, and I got anything witty for that one?  Yeah.  Wait, if you have a pussy, you might as well eat it.  See?  We've got to get one of those.  We've got one of those.  Wait, what is the feature?  You guys do like wacky news at the end of the show?  Yeah, we just kill time.  You know, when you're out of gas. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  Let's try the next story.  All right.  All right.  A woman has accused an obscene clown for gyrating at her and making rude requests.  She says the man was jumping out of behind trees and swinging his ships around.  I don't know.  I know.  I kind of lost my story here.  Is this what Michael said?  No, but she said that she spotted him hiding behind a tree and he's been doing it to women  and showing up at children's parties, gyrating and... 
[00:32:00]  Come on, Norton, save us.  I confess, it was just me in a clown suit.  You ass.  I can't win them all.  Oh, Dallas trash and Norton.  You're right.  The I confess one is a running joke and it stinks.  So the clown is just gyrating, that's it?  Yeah, and swinging his...  No, you know, wait, is this the guy in Georgia?  Is this the guy...  Is there some clown...  They make it?  There's some clown down in Georgia that they're trying to...  He shows up every summer for the summer season down there.  You mean like a clown with makeup?  Yeah, a clown with one of these street fridges. 
[00:32:30]  You want to see what the clown in Chicago did?  What is that?  What is that?  A little man named John Wayne Gacy.  Oh, yeah.  Now, that's a clown story.  That's Pogo the Clown.  I actually haven't even been listening to the content.  That voice is adorable.  That's Sybil.  Thank you.  Jesus.  Yeah, Sybil, you rock.  Thank you.  I was doing what the guy behind the tree was doing while you were talking.  Sybil's giggle is in high demand down here.  We don't have any girls on our show because they're too distracting. 
[00:33:00]  Well, I'm surrounded by girls.  All right, what else?  They're both pretty cute, too.  All right, give us one more.  Radio.  Lowered standards.  All right.  A woman in northern Greece forgot her four-month-old baby on a bus because she was talking on her  cell phone.  The woman was on the phone when she reached her stop, and when she got off, she forgot  her baby, and the bus driver heard crying on the back of the bus, and when he looked back,  he was surprised when he found a baby.  So the mother was not identified, and the bus company did not refer to the police. 
[00:33:30]  Anything nice?  I didn't know that they have cell phones in Greece.  I don't have anything funny to say.  I think that's hot enough on its own.  You're an awful man.  Come on, keep going.  You're auditioning for New York.  All right.  An anti-abortion group had an airplane fly over a southern California beach with a giant  banner depicting a two, I'm sorry, a ten-week-old aborted seated.  Yeah.  Oh, the banner carried a message reading, ten-week-old abortion, and that was so that 
[00:34:00]  people would see what it looked like, and they would picture little babies next time  they go out to have their abortion.  Is that like a press release?  Is that a news story?  It's a news story.  It should have went in a big circle and made like one of those little smoke things into  the form of a hanger.  All right, guys, really, we're going to get killed by our afternoon show if we don't  run.  He's going to come.  He doesn't like us.  All right, guys, this was a lot of fun.  We'll have to do it again sometime.  Thank you, guys.  We love you.  Sophie and Anthony, they're the best damn show on this day.  Right at 7 o'clock, another four hours. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  Thanks a lot, man.  There you go.  Thank you.  It's the new 105 for you.  And we just checked out Sybil's picture.  She's pretty hot.  Where is it?  Now we got KXOA checking in from Sacramento.  We got Steve.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, you guys were just talking about the sinking of our restaurant here in town, and  I thought I'd call to verify that we lost an entire band's worth of equipment to it.  So what happened?  You guys had a bunch of listeners on a barge?  Yeah, there's a restaurant here called Crawdads, and Tim, Chip, and Lisa, who come on right 
[00:35:00]  before you, I had a party there last Thursday, and they started getting the audience to jump.  We had about 300 people there, and the band was cooking.  Everybody was getting sauced.  And they started jumping up and down, and next thing you know, the entire bandstand collapsed  into the Sacramento River.  I thought it was great.  Did you guys get some local coverage on that?  In fact, in about 15 minutes after that happened, Tim and Chip were busy grabbing guitars and 
[00:35:30]  amplifiers and keyboards.  We got some great shots of the carnage on the website.  So you just go to KXOA?  Go to 937KXOA.com and click on Tim, Chip, and Lisa.  And on their website, you'll see we've got about 60 pictures of carnage, total carnage.  All right, cool.  They had to evacuate the place after it was all over.  Did anybody die?  Unfortunately, no.  All right.  You want to see the lake in North Carolina trick with a... 
[00:36:00]  Jesus, Jim.  They got a little press for a radio station.  Bad.  Fortunately, none of our equipment was lost, just the band's.  Steve, one of the ringers coming in for the WOW Contest.  You know, I hear you slamming me about that.  Every friggin' day, they're not ringers.  You know what, though?  Our listeners, they can't wait.  They're like, when are the ringers from Sacramento going to be showing up on openinganthony.com  as part of the WOW Contest?  Now, you notice...  You have one girl so far, and she's beautiful. 
[00:36:30]  Yes, she is.  And you notice that she may not be a ringer, but she does have rings in an appropriate place.  We call them door knockers.  Is that what those are?  That's a wacky name for a man.  All right, Steve.  All right, thanks, man.  We'll send some ringers soon, I promise.  All right, cool.  All right, hey, and keep it up, because KXOA.  KXOA loves you guys.  Hey, Steve.  Yeah.  I totally nailed him.  Sibyl's hot, man.  We're looking at the PugsAndKellyShow.com, and they got Sibyl's pictures up there, and there's 
[00:37:00]  one where she's sitting on the toilet.  But somebody walked in on her.  Come on, that's it.  That's so great.  That girl's cute.  Oh, yeah.  Is that the pigtail she has, or no?  Is that just her...  No, it's her suspenders, or her little thing she's wearing.  She's all right.  She's cute.  All right.  Sitting on a toilet.  It's just so nice.  Oh, sorry.  I walked in, but while I'm here...  Hey, the car chase...  You saved me some paper.  I'm sorry, sorry.  It's still going?  Yeah, the car chase is still going.  Yeah.  So, there's nothing to report there. 
[00:37:30]  They've been going for close to an hour, right?  This car chase?  Gas.  It's California, I'm telling you.  They're not aggressive enough.  Cliff, I figure eventually the guy's going to run out of gas and have to stop anyway.  Even though it may be a while, but they figure maybe they'll save a life.  Ah, screw that.  Flames and blood.  Andrew, what's going on?  Thank God I live in New York.  I don't have to listen to that lame-ass crap.  Look at Andrew.  They're big supporters of the show, Andrew.  They had a pretty funny line about her looking like the bassist from Rat.  That was hilarious.  Yeah, they had a couple good lines in there. 
[00:38:00]  All right, Andrew.  Have a good day, boys.  Bye.  Yeah.  Let's go to Tommy.  Tommy, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Man, I just found a legion of forces joke writers.  What's going on, man?  It's the only bad thing about syndication.  You've got to deal with guys named Chip.  No, that wasn't.  Chip didn't call in.  No, as soon as I hear the name Chip, I had to change the station until I just didn't hear that name again.  Yeah, it's very rare that you enjoy it.  I don't think Chip called in.  And the name O.P. is so goddamn cool.  Yeah, it's a lot better than Chip, O.P.  All right, cool.  Thank you, Tom. 
[00:38:30]  Thank you.  This car chase stinks, by the way.  I know.  They just panned out, and there's like five patrol cars way, way back in the distance.  They're not even dealing with them.  You know how this should end?  Like Jane Mansfield.  That's how every fox car chase should end.  Oh, decapitation.  Beautiful breasts and no annoying head above to distract you.  John from D.C.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  You suck, Norton.  You rule.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, I saw you guys down at the state show.  It was Evil Boy, actually.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey, listen. 
[00:39:00]  I was thinking, you know, that plane that went down, the way those wings came off, I was thinking  maybe when they picked up that scuba diver out of the water, maybe if he was loosening  bolts trying to get out of there or something.  Maybe he was loosening bolts to get out of the tank.  Instead of throwing a skate patch or something and just loosen the wrong ones, you know.  They said there were three bodies, and there's only two seats up front, right?  Yeah.  Right.  There you go.  They picked up the scuba diver.  The scuba diver out in the water, but you've learned how that happens.  They pick one up, drop them in the woods, you know.  And he probably knows the story and said, I'm doomed unless I, you know, loosen a few of these 
[00:39:30]  nuts and bolts.  There's chances to get out of there before they dump them, right?  That's a good theory to go with, John.  What else would work?  All right, John.  Thank you.  Can the L.A. cops do something, please?  This guy's actually making rest stops and paying tolls.  Can they pull this scumbag over and shoot him?  Yeah, nothing's going on.  Sean from Cleveland, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Now, Sean, you're pissed off at who?  I hear Dallas is jocking on our women in Ohio, huh?  Yeah.  I got a girl going down in 92.3 extreme tomorrow, take some pictures. 
[00:40:00]  You're going to take it.  Well, there we go.  Well, yeah, well, they'll explain it somewhere.  Keep a peek out for her.  All right, thank you.  All right, you guys rule.  Godspeed.  Well, I think all the radio stations and all the cities have to really step up in this  wow contest.  Yes.  Including New York.  Yeah, none of you are off the hook here.  Please send us your hot chicks.  And they're cans.  Immediately.  $5,000 cash up for grabs courtesy of risquevideo.com.  R-I-S-Q-U-E video.com.  You just go down to the station we broadcast on. 
[00:40:30]  They take your picture.  They send it to us.  We put them up on opianthony.com.  The listeners check out the contestants and eventually they're going to vote for the winner.  Here, let me ask you something, ladies.  This is just for the ladies out there.  Look at the website.  Go there.  Do it now.  Go to opianthony.com.  Punch up the contestants.  Go ahead.  Now look at each and every one of them.  Now look down at your own luscious breasts.  They're better than the ones you're seeing, right? 
[00:41:00]  If they are, you might win $5,000.  If you honestly look in the mirror and go, wow, you know, I got nice cans.  You go down to the station or come down to the station in New York.  We'll take your picture.  And please, my grant.  And a little suggestion to the ladies out there.  If you have to reach up all the way to the ceiling, you might want to stay home to make them look like they're a little plakier. 
[00:41:30]  Hey, man, I have no problem with you reaching a little bit to give yourself a little help.  But if you find yourself reaching all the way and touching the ceiling to make them look good, you might want to stay home.  You're doing a full back bend.  Your hands are on the floor.  Have you got sandbags supporting your back because you're leaning back so far?  You like a little what?  Like a teardrop, like heavy and hanging but solid.  You like that?  Yeah, man. 
[00:42:00]  Not droopy and awful.  Like a little, like, ooh, that's full of...  A little something to them.  Whatever they fill with.  If you have to hang upside down to make them look good, stay home.  You ever smell the sweat under one?  That can be pretty gamey.  Whoa.  I'm telling you.  Stop taking the hotness out of this contest.  I will not allow you to do that.  You don't even have to mention that because there was a contestant in a contest that we had.  Holy ass.  Up in Boston.  The chick claimed to be Peter Wolf's daughter.  Yes. 
[00:42:30]  That's right.  This girl had the smelliest...  Sounded like a litter of wolf pups were under her breasts.  This girl had the smelliest boobs ever.  Ever smelled.  How did you smell them?  Because...  She just walked into the room topless and the smell was beyond ridiculous.  Here's what she did.  We were having a heaviest breast contest.  We had a scale.  How many contests can you have with boobs?  I don't know.  We've had about five or six different ones.  And the girls would...  My favorite was the heaviest boob, though.  That was a good one.  Because real fast, we had...  And remember those uptight bitches that worked at the station? 
[00:43:00]  They were all pissed at us because we were using the male scale?  Yeah, the scale that they used to weigh the male on.  And that didn't even work well.  We would steal it and then have the girls with these big, heavy boobs just pop them on the  scale so they could weigh them.  They would just lay them up there.  It was a nice digital scale.  So it was on the console.  And she was one of the contestants, had huge boobs.  So she lifts up one of her breasts to put on the scale.  And we got this waft of...  What was it? 
[00:43:30]  Seriously, a combination of...  You ever pass by a yard and know that there's in the hedges somewhere a dead rat or a dead  possum?  Yes.  That smell of rotting flesh?  And then someone took a whole bottle of ammonia and poured it over the top of it?  No.  Because there was some ammonia happening.  Yeah, yeah.  It was like an ammonia type wee-wee smell.  Cool.  And it was...  No, not in a good way.  Okay.  It was horrid.  And she had, like, pockets under there that were almost like pits. 
[00:44:00]  It was, like, pitted.  I didn't know what was going on.  Was she fat?  Of course.  Oh, this is a shock.  Yeah, of course she was.  Like, fat monsters spilling up the whole room.  Kayla!  Yo!  What's up, Kayla?  Nothing.  All right.  You're one of the contestants in the WOW Contest?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Let's pop up Kayla's pictures.  Let me see that.  I think the website's getting slammed now.  Well, because the ladies that I just gave the word out to are now looking.  She's representing Philly and saying, hey. 
[00:44:30]  All right.  What's going on, Kayla?  Nothing much.  Just listening to you guys on the radio.  All right.  Dissing everybody that's on there right now.  What?  Dissing everybody, man.  We don't diss anybody.  Who's getting dissed?  What?  The Dallas people were dissing you guys bad.  Yeah, we don't diss anyone.  And we were standing up for our contestants.  All right.  What's up, Kayla?  Nothing much.  I just wanted to tell anybody that's listening to you guys that I'm at Cheerleaders New Jersey right now.  I've been there for two years, and I'm there every night from 9 to 2, so. 
[00:45:00]  Wow, you're cute.  That's you.  Yeah, look at that.  Kayla.  Wow, she's pretty.  Kayla, do you have kids?  No.  What's the kid noises in the background?  Other dancers, probably.  Huh?  We hear kid noises in the background.  My brother.  Oh, okay.  Ah.  All right.  No, Kayla, you have a very, um, here, turn that around again, Anthony.  There you go.  Yeah, Kayla, you got very, uh, beautiful, uh, blue eyes.  Thank you.  Yes. 
[00:45:30]  Thank you very much.  You're very pretty.  I think you're very sexy.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Where's Cheerleaders?  I'm going to try to make it fun.  You should have joined our Best Eyes contest.  Oh, you're messed up.  What?  I like your eyes.  That's all I'm saying.  Dude, I think she's tough.  She's got beautiful eyes.  Turn around.  Turn around again.  Hold on.  I'm going to another picture.  Why am I messed up?  Turn it around.  I didn't say anything bad about you.  Let me see.  Hold on.  It's coming down.  There you go.  Look at you.  She's pretty.  Wow.  All right.  I got a different angle of you there, Kayla. 
[00:46:00]  Very nice.  Thank you.  I like the camera on the ceiling.  Yeah, it's good, right?  It shows the downward slope.  Helps out a world of earth.  That's good.  Kayla, so, uh, you're going to be at this Cheerleaders?  Yes.  Every night?  I'm there every night this week.  Where is Cheerleaders?  Where is it?  It's on Route 130 in Gloucester City.  All right.  Kayla's getting all bummed at us.  What's wrong, Kayla?  Nothing much.  I mean...  What? 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  I listen to you guys every day, and I was calling up, you know, to give a shout out.  You know, everybody and everyone at Cheerleaders, and I got a lot of people that are going to vote for me, but, I mean...  Kayla, you know the show.  We're just trying to have fun.  Oh, I know.  Don't take it personally.  Let me see you again here.  Oh, I think I am.  Well, there we go.  I think you're very hot.  Yeah, without a doubt.  Thank you.  There's nothing wrong with you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I used to pass by Cheerleaders on my way to peep shows.  Really?  Yeah.  I know where that is.  There's one in Chile, too.  There's one in Jersey. 
[00:47:00]  There's nothing wrong with you compared to the other contestants.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  See, that was nice, right?  Yeah.  All right.  See, I made up for it.  Thank you.  All right, Kayla.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Would you knock it off?  Jesus Christ.  No one's going to come down.  Dude, I really think she's good-looking.  I think she's very hot.  She is.  Yeah.  Nice eyes.  You're just mean-spirited. 
[00:47:30]  Make fun of people.  Yeah.  People.  Yeah, Ben.  All right.  Well, the car chase is still going.  Yeah.  It's just-  What a shock.  God, we keep up.  The box stinks.  I think they just looped the same 30-second clip.  Knowing everyone's just going to keep watching?  That's a good idea.  There's a lot of McDonald's on this chase.  It's like when Fred is running through his house on the Flintstones.  His really long living room.  The same couch, window, and painting of a mammoth goes by.  That always confused me as a kid. 
[00:48:00]  I'm like, well, the outside shot of the Flintstones,  Flintstones' house looks really small and tiny.  But when they're inside and Fred's running from one side of the room to the other,  it takes forever.  The Flintstones is running.  Makes the sound.  When he runs.  I hated the Flintstones.  One of the greatest cartoons ever.  I hated it.  I don't.  Absolutely.  I hate any cartoon with canned laughter.  That was great.  It drove me nuts.  I hated it.  It's like a classic.  That cartoon was the best. 
[00:48:30]  There wasn't a better cartoon than the Flintstones.  That was a great-  Well, Bugs Bunny?  You've got to give Bugs Bunny number one.  No, no.  The old Warner Brothers.  The Flintstones is top five.  Being smashed in the face with an anvil?  Yes.  That was a lot funnier than Fat, Dumb Fred.  I just never liked them.  I'm not saying you can't like them.  But you've got to, you know, when you're a cartoon connoisseur,  you realize, yes, the old Warner Brothers cartoons,  there's no beating them.  But they dropped the ball by the time the Flintstones came out,  which was with the mid-60s.  The Warner Brothers cartoons had already dropped the ball, 
[00:49:00]  cut costs, the animation sucked.  They went with stock music.  If you watch the old ones,  there was an orchestra that watched that goddamn cartoon,  and every step they took, you'd hear that ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  you know, like a little thing going, a drum, or whatever.  The xylophone.  They went with stock music and crappy animation.  And the Flintstones were still doing some of the, you know,  writing the music for each scene and stuff like that. 
[00:49:30]  Very good cartoon.  You just don't know.  I just always thought it was awful.  And it was a Honeymooners thing.  That's why I kind of resented it.  It was a rip-off.  It was an homage.  It was an homage.  All right.  I don't like that word.  We're going to break again.  The car chase is still happening.  I am rock glory.  It was great.  I also hated the Jetsons.  That I didn't like.  I thought that was so overrated.  Didn't like the Jetsons.  What was the dog's name?  Astro.  Astro.  Oh, it's futuristic.  And I hated Scooby-Doo. 
[00:50:00]  How do you, the fact that that film made $56 million,  Americans, you are retards.  Isn't that annoying?  What a disgrace.  And talk about bad animation.  They'd have a matte picture and then just animate the mouth.  So it's like you're just staring at a blank picture.  The original cartoon, right?  Yeah, the original cartoon.  And then like one of their mouths would just move.  Yeah.  Hey, Scooby.  There he goes.  How could you even enjoy watching something like that?  What are they interviewing?  Christopher Reeve? 
[00:50:30]  It looked like that.  Yeah, but the Harlem Globetrotters one was good.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Ran into them in the swamp there.  Awful bad stories.  Yeah, pesky kids.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd have gotten away with it too.  And then one of the Harlem Globetrotters,  he was like sitting on the alligator, but he didn't know.  Mm-hmm.  And then he got scared because the alligator like, you know,  decided to roar or something.  Yeah.  How about the Harlem Globetrotters cartoon?  I didn't like that.  That was kind of a spin-off.  They drove around in their van.  I liked them better when they were just guest stars on other cartoons. 
[00:51:00]  And do you remember that a basketball court opened up on top of the van?  Oh, yeah.  I do remember that.  And like from the long shot, it wouldn't be much bigger than the van.  But when they were showing the shots from the floor, it was giant.  How did they do that?  How the hell did they do that?  Is that the Scooby-Doo one where Meadowlark Lemon took the ball and said,  what is wrong with you today?  Rooby-Doo?  All right, Jim.  Visual jokes don't work on the radio. 
[00:51:30]  Works for us, though.  You should know that.  How are we doing?  All right, Ed.  When we get back, we've got to talk about J-Lo.  There's a sex tape out there.  Starting to hear it, Ross.  We're hearing things.  This would be great.  I heard someone told me Suge Knight had that.  I don't know if that's true enough.  That's what I heard a long time ago.  You don't talk bad about Suge, man.  Who would not?  What did you just say about Suge?  Someone told me that Suge Knight had that tape.  Like I'm paranoid again.  Yeah, I am.  What did you just say about Suge?  That he's very handsome and tall.  I would never.  I would fillet him standing up. 
[00:52:00]  He's 6'8".  Chelsea Clinton drunk, Anthony.  We've got some comments about that.  We've got to call Lady Di today.  See if she stays or goes.  The only place I want to see her is in front of this car.  In front of this speeding car.  Hey, can we play the tippy-tom thing?  We're getting a lot of requests for that.  Who are you?  Our homeless faggot.  I don't know that was the proper terminology these days.  He's a homeless faggot.  Homeless faggot. 
[00:52:30]  I don't know if I've ever seen a gay homeless person.  He's classic.  I'm going to go out on a limb.  I'm going to say I love tippy-tom.  Yeah, it's a big limb.  Homeless and he has AIDS.  You're 0 for 2.  I have hepatitis C, not AIDS.  AIDS can't kill you.  That's what he says.  AIDS can't.  Do we have more tippy-tom sound bites?  We're working on more?  God, they're the best.  You don't die of AIDS.  That's what it is, yeah. 
[00:53:00]  You don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  All right, George Garland, calm down.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  That's why I'm calling him a faggot.  If he's calling himself a faggot, I could call him a faggot.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  Faggot.  All right, well, he's got an alcohol service.  We think.  This was my partner.  And you think I'm sexy.  Come on, baby.  Nothing to be known.  Lonely?  You're saying it right.  Looking for the time of your life? 
[00:53:30]  Are you single?  Hygiene?  Not an issue?  Hepatitis C, which I've had 20 years.  Sit back, lube up, and dial tippy-tom.  I'm a slut.  He's homeless, smells like a dumpster, and he's horny.  Yeah, you lick my b***h.  For a bottle of Thunderbird, he's all yours.  I'm a human being.  I want a b***h.  Guys.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot when I was two years old.  Girls.  I have girlfriends, too. 
[00:54:00]  He's so drunk, he doesn't care.  All right, who's next?  Just name the place, and he'll be there.  We're out behind a dumpster or something like that.  Call 1-900-SYPHILIS for the ride of your life.  I know how to shake my bed.  Not responsible for any diseases contracted as a result of sex with Dippy Tom.  You're saying it right.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  I gotta tell you, man. 
[00:54:30]  I hate the car chase show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It always ends badly.  Well, last one was good, but this one sucked.  Back to the car chase.  This car chase ended just boring.  This guy was on the L.A. freeways for, what, over an hour and a half?  Yeah.  He finally slowed down to nothing.  Then he stopped.  Then he showed his hands to the cops, saying, look, I don't have any weapons. 
[00:55:00]  Then the cops made him back up with his hands up in the air.  Walk backwards.  Walk backwards like that for about 100 yards.  And then he got on the ground and they arrested him.  And that was it.  The end of that car chase.  Over.  Boring.  What a dull way to end the car chase.  One of the guys, though, asked a really good question.  He goes, hey, has anyone ever got away with one of these car chases?  He said, never.  Because they have never gotten away with a car chase when it's been on TV like that with the helicopters. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, when you can have a helicopter just follow you wherever, how are you going to ever get away with a car chase?  In the old days, before the helicopters and stuff, you might be able to make a couple quick moves and dodge the cops.  But you can't, you know, outrun helicopters and stuff.  Huh?  What?  Enough gas to go to Paris front.  That line?  Oh, no, that was horrible.  What's his name?  Trace something?  What?  The reporter?  It's a complete jizz bag. 
[00:56:00]  Trace something.  It's the worst name I've ever heard.  Ah, Joe, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Okay.  The new Scooby-Doo is you've got to see them.  They're hilarious because they refer back to the old ones.  Like, the gang breaks up because it's always the same.  Because everybody's always wearing a mask in the end.  Yeah.  And they go their separate ways.  And then they'll be saying that Fred, like, they'll be talking about Fred, like, why does he always wear that ascot?  It's got to be.  Oh.  It's got to snuff the air from by now.  Oh, the new movie is making fun of the cartoon? 
[00:56:30]  Yes, they refer back to all the old cartoons.  They have the plots were always the same.  And they always wore the same clothes.  Oh, I see.  And you know what?  That doesn't make it suck any less.  Now it's clever.  That's their idea of justifying the garbage they're putting out.  Well, we can just show like we're hip and we're poking fun.  It was no longer hip.  You stink.  You're running around with a talking dog.  It's awful.  Scooby-Doo is a cartoon that you couldn't even, if you were over 10 years old, you weren't into it.  Talking dogs are only funny if they're inspiring you to kill couples in New York. 
[00:57:00]  You've got to sit and watch it with your kids.  That's what.  David Bergwitz reference.  Nice.  Hey, Joe.  Yeah.  Was the movie good?  Oh, no.  Not the movie.  Not the movie.  The live animation.  The new animation movies they have.  They have them for the, it's really popular with the kids.  I have kids.  That's how I see them.  Oh, my God, Joe.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  You've got to think the movie stinks.  Yeah, that's what I want.  Maybe we should see it and then form our opinion.  But it's just, the previews look just absolutely awful. 
[00:57:30]  Not funny at all.  Like, not entertaining to sit through.  Yeah.  I hated the Scooby-Doo character.  Having the big Shaggy and the Scooby snack.  It'll be funny if he was eating dog food next to a really old person and she's like,  my check didn't come in and she was eating dog food and then her heart stopped and she cried.  Now, that is funny.  That would be really funny.  Or if Scooby had like a little, maybe a little, a little girl and Albert Fish showed up and said, 
[00:58:00]  I'm going to take her to a party.  Now, that's an entertaining movie.  Here, where is she?  I don't know.  Scooby's steak.  Hey, Jeff, what's up?  Opie and Anthony, it is an absolute pleasure to talk to you guys.  Whoa, hey, thank you.  And Norton.  Very informal.  I'm calling from Seattle. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  You guys just supposedly were going to make your big debut last night.  I just wondered if you had any idea why it didn't happen.  I don't know what's going on with Seattle because we gave you the big hello last night on the show.  We were real happy.  We said a lot of really nice things.  Hello, Seattle.  Hello.  We basically kissed your asses really good last night, and then we're finding out today the show never ran in Seattle.  Yeah, we had to hear Lionel again last night.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe they're working out last-minute details or something.  Well, I hope I hear you seven hours from now tonight.  All right.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thanks. 
[00:59:00]  Bye, Jeff.  Bye.  Spread the word.  O&A back in Seattle.  We think maybe they didn't bring the big chest full of gold doubloons to our agent to get us on there.  The big chest of gold doubloons.  Dominic.  Yeah.  How's it going, guys?  All right.  You saw Scooby-Doo?  Yeah, I saw it.  It was pretty bad.  You know, it was kind of funny, but I just didn't like the way they did it, and I don't know if I should give away the ending, but...  Who cares, dude?  Who cares?  Give it away. 
[00:59:30]  What could it possibly be?  No, I don't even...  No, no, no.  Because...  No, I've got to give it away, because it's just terrible.  That the bad guy is Scrappy-Doo.  Scrappy...  Did they have a lot of funny drug references during the movie?  No, no drug references, but it was definitely Scrappy-Doo.  That was right.  Yeah, that was the ending.  The guy wasn't a bad guy.  I mean, how can he do that?  That's terrible.  Was Scooby-Doo dead throughout the whole movie, and no one knew?  That'd be good.  No, actually, that was pretty good.  The animation of Scooby was really, really good. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, stop it.  It wasn't good.  I'm telling you.  It wasn't good.  CGI.  You can make anything now.  No, it wasn't good.  All right, you know what, guys?  I'm going to step in here.  What's the matter?  Remember that stupid golf talk yesterday?  Let's stop at the Scooby-Doo talk.  If you could put the two together and beat Scooby-Doo to death with a golf club, that would  be interesting.  We've got to know when to cut our losses on this show.  Yeah.  I'm very passionate about it.  We went 20 minutes too long with the golf thing, and I think Scooby-Doo conversation 
[01:00:30]  really doesn't have enough oomph.  That's very into my cartoons.  I get a little carried away.  Doesn't Shaggy, like, uh, doesn't he, uh, doesn't he handcuff his daughter to the  radiator and then beat Hedda?  That would be an interesting Scooby-Doo.  Oh, my God.  That is funny.  They took Scrappy and buried him in an underground bunker in his backyard.  Remember her? 
[01:01:00]  Katie Beers.  Little Katie Beers.  That was a Katie Beers reference.  Little Katie Beers.  And Sal, uh, Iglinary or something like that.  Yeah, that guy.  He's out on parole, bro.  Did they get paroled?  Did he?  Last week or two weeks ago.  I know he was up for parole.  Did he get out?  Oh, yeah.  How old was she when a girl?  She's now, like, 18 years old.  Oh, she's alive.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They found it.  He had set up an underground little...  I don't know if that story went national or did it.  The name is very familiar.  I've heard of her. 
[01:01:30]  This guy.  Oh, yeah, this story was great.  This guy built a whole room behind a wall in his basement for, uh, Katie Beers.  Went into his basement, built this whole underground thing where it had a bed, a TV.  It was all soundproof.  There was a camera so he could watch her.  And, um, there was also a camera upstairs that went to a monitor in the room so little  Katie could watch what he was doing.  Did he rape her?  No.  No.  No.  Not at all.  Oh, all right, all right.  He took her to a video game playing complex out on Long Island and then, uh, brought her 
[01:02:00]  back to his house and put her in this little bunker and said, I don't know what happened  to her.  I brought her back home and...  He was a family friend, too, right?  But he didn't sexually abuse her.  He wouldn't...  No, he would make her, like, wear things so he could look or stuff like that.  So there was a sexual thing to her?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Obviously.  But he didn't, you know, go the distance or anything like that.  But the thing is, the video monitor she would watch, there were a few times where the cops  were over his house questioning him and she could watch him talking to the cops and she's 
[01:02:30]  banging on the door going, let me out, let me out.  But he had soundproofed the whole thing.  It was a sick story, man.  How long did he have?  Can you believe it?  Huh?  Yeah, like a couple weeks.  Yeah, it was a while.  Yeah.  But the guy made parole.  He's out there again.  That's sick.  Isn't that amazing?  You know, drug dealers go to jail for 25 years or, God forbid, you want to rob a bank  because we're so built in this country on property.  If you rob a banker and steal someone's property 25 years with a handgun, you can kidnap  a kid and get out and take it. 
[01:03:00]  It's disgraceful.  I know.  It's disgraceful.  Yeah, it don't make sense.  Yeah, that guy sucks.  Remember when they finally put the cuffs on him and you were just looking at him like,  oh, God.  Before all the details came out about what he didn't do, thank God, you're just looking  like, oh.  Disgusting.  Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, the guy's pretty smart.  I like to chain mine to the radiator.  Anyway, don't clear your throat after that.  Just take your bombing like a man.  Well, I'm just saying. 
[01:03:30]  It might have been good, but I just did a chaining to the radiator reference, so it  was kind of like redundant.  That's the only reason.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm sorry.  That's all right, Angel.  I was about to say that.  All right.  There you go, PK.  It happens to all of us, too.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, because Jim brings up a good point.  It happens to all of us, us on the radio, you guys listening, where you want to go with  the line and then you realize halfway through it that it sucks.  You lose confidence.  Yeah, you lose confidence.  And then you finish anyway really weakly.  Yeah.  Like your voice drops off and you're like, well, I'm just saying. 
[01:04:00]  I'll bet.  That's what she was doing.  Well, to the radiator.  Okay, well.  Go ahead, Dave.  Yeah, I saw a movie do.  It was like a rock concert, bro.  We were yelling, your side sucks and everything.  I just want to tell you.  It was like a rock concert.  Dave comes back strong.  Thank you.  All right.  He has a reference from yesterday's show.  Very nice.  Very good.  That's why you got to listen to all four hours of the show because we'll pick up something  from yesterday and play with it today.  Right?  Does that make sense? 
[01:04:30]  Sort of?  I just, I don't need to see Scooby-Doo.  Esposito is the guy that locked up beers.  I thought it was, who was Sal?  Oh, no, that was, wasn't there the stepmother?  Like, she had been given up by her original mother.  The kids thought it was just a horror.  But now she's got a good life and I hear she's in college or something or going to college.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right.  Yeah.  Saling Larry is eligible for parole July 1st.  The hearing they had two weeks ago out in Riverhead was for, basically, they were going  to say what level of a kid toucher he was, who got to know about it, if he had to go 
[01:05:00]  door to door and say, I live in your neighborhood now, or if the police were to put him on whatever  kind of list.  And he didn't have Katie Beers.  That guy's name was Esposito or something.  He's still in jail.  He's not eligible for parole for a couple more years.  So who's this other guy?  Saling Larry?  He abused her.  He's the, uh, they were a friend of the family.  Yeah.  And she, the woman was taking care of Katie Beers for Katie's mother. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Sal was watching Katie Beers.  Right.  He was abusing her.  He was abusing her.  The other guy was just kind of a friend.  And then he passed, he, that's right, now I know the story.  Then Sal passed Katie Beers on to this other scumbag who, uh, who put her in that, uh,  that basement thing.  Right.  And it's real nice because his, his fat, one-legged wife is living in Uniondale in  some assisted living place.  And now, uh, he's probably going to go move in there with her.  So, uh.  How are these people, for all you stupid liberals out there that are against the death penalty,  how are these two animals not just lined up and shot against a wall? 
[01:06:00]  Mm-hmm.  How do you not just, just put a bullet in their heads and save the taxpayers money?  Here's the story.  Scumbags.  December 28th, 92 to January 13th, 93, Katie Beers held captive by John Esposito in a secret  underground Bunkier in Bayshore, Long Island.  On the second day of her captivity, Katie celebrated her 10th birthday.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh.  That's horrid.  Waiting for that story to read, Jim Norton.  No, I'm not.  They never made a movie out of that? 
[01:06:30]  I'm a pervert with adults.  They never made a movie out of that?  No, I don't think so.  That would make a good movie.  Yeah.  How many comics can we see?  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm such a dick.  They should make a sitcom out of it.  At least it was finally interesting to have a kid doing something besides making snappy  remarks.  That I wouldn't mind watching.  A little canned laughter when he slams that door on her.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  This week on Where's My Kid?  This is the thing. 
[01:07:00]  This week on Touched by an Uncle.  I felt I had some confidence in that.  That's all right.  You belted it right out.  Thank you.

[01:10:30]  What's the matter?  Get up an orange cone and talk through it  What is wrong with Sprint?  Everywhere I go  If they call my completed network busy  For, uh, analog role  I'm in my house today on the phone  Alright, wait a minute  Alright, time out  You have analog still?  You know, I have analog role in case I can't get digital  Because it's so unreliable in certain places  Don't think I do the road  I have a lot of friends with the Sprint  And I'm thinking about changing to Sprint  Sprint blows  People love the Sprint  Ben loves the Sprint  No, he does  And it stinks 
[01:11:00]  Sprint sucks  AT&T is good  My friend Decker has Sprint  It sucks  It stinks  It never works  I have a phone that just decides not to ring  Dude, mine does that all the time  And then all of a sudden I look at my phone  I'm like, five messages  And it's been in my pocket with the vibrator thing on  The second I hear a ring  It's too late  I hit it and go, what happened?  One ring  I'm on the phone today  Getting my stupid computer  Trying to fix this goddamn T1 line  And I'm on the phone in my apartment  And the next thing it goes  Signal faded 
[01:11:30]  That little noise when the call gets dropped  And I've actually bitten my phone  If you work for Sprint  You're working for a horrible company  With horrible, horrible technology  He buys his phone  Go with anyone but them  They're terrible  Jim was telling us before the show  That he was thinking about  Jumping out his building today  You don't know  You don't understand  Jumping out his window  The depression I have been in  Should I quit smoking?  I'm a fat pig  No, you're not  You got the same awful body from 19...  What was it?  93  I was sitting there because my goddamn TiVo  Wasn't loading problem 
[01:12:00]  And of course  Look at technology just screwing you over  Of course, little fat Jimmy can't figure it out  That's what I'm thinking  Of course, little fat stupid boy can't figure it out  What was wrong with your TiVo?  It's not downloading properly  It's nothing wrong with it  I don't know  But you don't watch TV  So I've been watching Taxi and the Osbournes  Of course I do  And then what's wrong with your computer?  The goddamn connection is not working  His TiVo, his computer, his phone  And I hit my phone  And nothing is working for me  And I literally was in my underwear  And I had a second where I'm looking at my window 
[01:12:30]  And I'm standing in my living room  And I'm like  Throw your fat worthless body through it  22nd floor  I should have plunged  Did you hear yourself say it?  No, but you do not understand  What was on in my apartment  I would love to see you run  Full speed into your window  Just to crash off the window  And bounce back into your living room  You don't understand  The way I think in my apartment  Really?  I really had a moment where I'm like  Throw yourself through it  You know why?  Oh my God  And he wants to live higher than he is now  Why don't we bring you down to the second story  You understand what I'm talking about? 
[01:13:00]  Just the rage of being so goddamn impotent  When it comes to anything that a man should be able to do  Like God forbid I should look at a problem and go  Hey, alright, and have a little solution  It's always a mis-happin  Ugh, piss the fat and call a real man to come over and fix it  You just explained three things that wasn't your fault though  People don't understand  Your phone's not your fault  The TiVo's not your fault  And the computer thing is not your fault  It's not like your car broke down 
[01:13:30]  And you can't figure out how to fix it  Or like your faucet's leaking  And you can't figure out how to fix it  These are three things that just happen to happen  No, not the computer thing  People think that I write this material on my act  Oh, he just wants to be angry  It's not based on that  I've actually  I really, literally  Looked at myself without his shirt  And I couldn't fix the goddamn TiVo  And I'm like, do it  Just do it  Jump  And it was a quick thought  You know, I mean, I'm not drunk or anything  It was just that quick  Just that sound of a shattering glass  Did you picture it?  I really did 
[01:14:00]  I really, honestly, God did  Just my fat torso going through a window  And serving me right  If I had a body as awful as yours  I would never walk around without a T-shirt on  I do it to make myself mad  Look at my little appendectomy scar  And my meat  I would never walk around my place without a shirt on  Jesus, man  Well, there's no one there  Believe me, you ought to see if I bring a girl home  The lights have to be dim  So my fat B-cuffs can't be seen  I should be milked into a bucket  And then beaten with a belt  Until I do a sit-up across my fat, white stomach 
[01:14:30]  Little fat belly  Little fat, pale fish belly  Who can't fix anything  Bob Kelly's my friend  He's a comic  And I have to constantly call another man  Hey, Bob, could you look at my thing?  Really?  My computer  Yeah, I understand  That would be isolated  Now, you've been decorating a lot  And putting things in your house  Do you have to have people  Like hang things on the walls and stuff?  I haven't hung anything yet  Except my signed Sabbath poster  Who I love YSP  For giving me  Thank you  I have to  Yes, of course I'm going to have to  Of course 
[01:15:00]  A man  Will have to come over  Because it's drywall  In an apartment building  And I know  That I can never make the judgment  Or find the studs in the wall  And I'll hang something  And it will fall  Oh, look at how angry you get to myself  Don't worry  Hold on, hold on  They dumped out of that  And they should have  That's my fault  Jim, you know what it is  I'm with you on that one, Twitter boy  You go to a hardware store  And you pick up all the stuff you need  To hang the stuff with properly  So it doesn't fall  Yeah, then I call Anthony 
[01:15:30]  And I say, look, you're a man  Could you help me?  I can pay for it  That's what I can be  I can go fetch at the store  And I can  I'm not even kidding, man  I'm really bad with this stuff  Really?  And it's been proven to me  For 33 years  That every time  Little Jimmy Norton  Tries something like that  He's going to F it up  Every time  It's not once in a while  Really?  It's not like, you know  I'm batting 250 or 300  I am batting zero  When it comes to just  Doing things like that  I hate myself  With stuff like that 
[01:16:00]  Wow  I can't even work  My mini-disc recorder  I've been bringing it on  At the cellar  And there's like little problems  Like little things  That anyone  Anyone can work out  Yeah  And I'm in front of the audience  One night  And I'm losing my mind  And I'm not trying to be funny  With them  Oh, no  And I'm not putting on  The wacky self-hate  I'm like you people  Have no idea  If I could blow my brains  Out in front of you  Right now, I would  And of course they didn't laugh  Because I wasn't kidding  Pinch your fat  No, I have to  Yeah  Do you understand  It's those moments, man 
[01:16:30]  I really can't ever own a shotgun  I can't do it  Really?  No, never  You might actually  No, I would  And it would be something stupid  It would be a girl  I was supposed to see  I couldn't see  And then the TiVo didn't work  And there go the brains  All over the ceiling  It just takes two things  It's disgraceful  Any combination of two things  Will put you over the edge  No, it drives me crazy  It's such a quality of myself  Wow  That I am so effing inept  And I am never going to  I'm a funny guy  That's the only reason  I ever get laid  Believe me  Without being funny  I'm a two and a half  I'm a four with humor 
[01:17:00]  But you know what it is  You're a clever guy  And you're not stupid  No, not where it counts, dude  I can do godfather quotes  But can I fix TiVo?  No  He just spilled his coffee, dude  Look at him  Look at his face  And then he goes to point  At the imaginary TiVo  Yeah  I go to point  And I can't act either  Because I don't know  Where anything in my scene is  That one goes to point  At the imaginary TiVo  That he can't fix  And he knocks his coffee 
[01:17:30]  There you go  Here's the real man  Here's the real man  Helping the little  Rick is helping  Boy  There you go  Little fat bosoms  We'll clean up after you  God, you're killing me  My throat is killing me  For laughing at you  Well, maybe the hot chick  Could come in  And go get me some more coffee  That'd be nice  From Starbucks  A place you hate  No, you know what?  I don't like Starbucks  Because I love their iced coffee  They're disgusting to pull that ad thing  If they were mocking 9-11  That is 
[01:18:00]  I think it's obvious  That they had some kind of a tie-in  If the genius thought  It was going to be subliminal  He's an idiot  That was in the paper  Where is that again?  It is  They pull the ad?  Oh, well  I mean, they would have had to  It's a  It's two  Twin teas  Twin teas  It's big cups of tea  No, no  Some type of  A Starbucks ad campaign  Has ground to a halt  After concerns  That its posters 
[01:18:30]  Including one displayed  Near ground zero  Callously mimic  The September 11th tragedy  The tempest in a teapot  Revolved around  3,000 window displays  Touting summer tea brews  By depicting two twin cups  Of the concoction  Standing side by side  In tall squared off blades of grass  With dragonflies  Dive bombing into one of them  The words  Collapsed into cool  Are printed above the image  Starbucks has now  Yanked the posters  And none too soon  See, the thing is  The squared off blades of grass  It's like buildings  They look like buildings  It's not squared off blades of grass 
[01:19:00]  It looks like a city skyline  Yeah  And then these two huge  Dragonflies  Cups  Twin cups  And then the dragonflies  Dive bombing into  Dive bombing into  And then collapse into cool  And then one of these posters  Was directly across from ground zero  Yeah  What scumbags in this company  What scumbags  That should be  I mean  You need money that bad  Starbucks  Who thought that up  And does he still have a job 
[01:19:30]  You know what I mean  Who did  That's something  Yeah, yeah  What head rolled for that one  That is  Horrific  And they got what they wanted  They got everyone talking about  Starbucks today  Nah, but nobody's talking about it  In a way that's going to go  Let me go out and try that  People are going  You know what  They should be burned  No one is talking about that  That's bad  There is such a thing as bad press  You know what you should do  Go in  Get two of them  And throw them right at the window  Of the place  Just throw them 
[01:20:00]  At the front window  Of  Of Starbucks  Yeah, and let it run down  So that  God damn mutant  That owns the place  Has to go out and clean it  Complete scumbag  Throw it in the door  Throw it at the person  It's amazing  And then there was a strip club  Using a couple  Of images too  All that I stand behind  Yes  It's all about freedom  It's all about freedom  It's a matter of time  We have to all  Kind of get this  Back to some normalcy  As they said  Now this  I don't know what they were 
[01:20:30]  Trying to do with this one  The strip club  Upstate New York  Huge sign  Really big sign  Split into three sections  The middle section  Had the name of the club  Exotic dancers  The address  Then flanked on either side  I didn't get the advertising  I didn't either  I don't think  It had nothing to do  They weren't  Trying to do a tie in  I think the owner  Of the place  Had three big panels  On a billboard type thing  Used the middle one  For his place  And then wanted to show  That you know 
[01:21:00]  He stands behind  The firemen  And you know  The heroes  And what else  And put a picture  Of the raising  Of that American flag  An upstate strip club  Is using a famous  Flag raising image  From September 11th  To promote itself  Drawing heated criticism  From victims' families  Emergency workers  And area residents  A billboard for the  Blue Moon Lounge  In Newburgh  60 miles north  Of New York City  Shows three patriotic  Firefighters raising the flag  In the rubble  At Ground Zero  Following the terror attacks  As well as six marines  Raising the flag  At Iwo Jima 
[01:21:30]  In between the two  Legendary pictures  Is information about  The strip club  Including boasts  Of exotic dancers  And the availability  Of adult toys  And lingerie  This is blasphemous  To use two of the  Most noble images  In the history  Of our country  To promote such  A tawdry industry  I don't see it  As promoting it  They're not  Yeah I agree  I don't  See this one  I don't have a problem with  It seems to me  Like the owner  Is a patriotic guy  Probably you know  Wanted to  Show that he  Supports  America 
[01:22:00]  And he put  The pictures up  It's not like  You know  Come on in  And see the twin towers  On the bimbo  We have  And he's not  Trying to do  A tie in  Or anything like that  I don't understand  What he's trying to do  I think it's just  Some dopey  Strip club owner  Guy going  Hey I'm going  To be patriotic  I got some  Room on the sign  I'm going to put  The pictures up  A bit tasteless  To put together  But I don't think  It's like  What Starbucks did  Is vile  Yeah  Like you  Attempting  At being clever  Scumbags  Dirtbags 
[01:22:30]  Seattle scumbags  Oh we should say  This guy's just  Stupid  Yeah this is just  Like a little tasteless  But for many reasons  Going back to Starbucks  Andrew reminded us  Of something here  Go ahead Andrew  Hey boys  Remember right after  9-11 they sent a bill  Down to the workers  At ground zero  For like 5 grand  10 grand  Oh for the water  They also  I will say in fairness  To them though  As disgraceful  Companies they are  They did donate  Like a million I think  They did  They had to  To save  After the heat  Was on  Stop it  Alright  I don't care why  They gave the money up 
[01:23:00]  Alright  I hate that creepy  Little whore  On every  Who is she  That little  Starbucks girl  With the little  Things around her  It's awful  Their insignia  Stinks  That should be  Sprint's insignia  Because it sucks  It's incompetent  And you'll get farther  Talking through a cup  Of Starbucks coffee  Than you will  A Sprint phone  You know what  I know I bitch  A lot about products  I'm so sick  Of bad products  Affecting my life  And incompetent  I've had a lot  Of great experiences too  But I'm so sick  Of bad customer service  And bad products  And that's why  I sniffle about it  Look  Some people  And the tip jar 
[01:23:30]  I'm sorry to interrupt you  That tip jar  At Starbucks  I throw up into  Every time I see it  I tip waitresses  I'm 20% every time  But you know why  Because they look at you  And they never say  Thank you  I've never had a  Starbucks employee  When I drop a bucket  And go hey  Thanks man  That's all I ask  Just be courteous  I'm throwing you a dollar  Nothing  Like it's expected  All you did was  Fetch me coffee  Now go and fetch  Someone else coffee  Because you're not  Getting my dollar anymore  But some of those  Coffee drinks  Are kind of hard to make  They're kind of complicated  And that's why  I throw a buck in  You've got to get  The milk just right 
[01:24:00]  Absolutely  They've got the little thing  They put in the milk  This thing  And I'll be damned  If it isn't tasty  So I throw a buck in  But you know what  If you're not going to thank me  Then I'm not tipping you  And they have the flavored things  Where they just  And they have to know  Exactly how much  To put in there  And then they mix it all up  For you nice  Your point is taken  I'm not saying that  It's cloning  Or it's age research  But I mean  It is still nice  That they're making me  A good nice cup  Of icy beverage  So I throw a dollar in  But no more  Because they don't thank me  Start being courteous  I despise rudeness  Yes Anthony  People are saying  That we're being tools 
[01:24:30]  Why?  And other people  Are being tools  About this whole thing  No  You guys are tools  Absolute tools  Why?  You see what you want  To see in that ad  And what ad?  With being a bunch of  Pussies  The Starbucks thing  That is blatantly obvious  And it says  Look at the Starbucks  That closely  There's somebody else  The grass  It's a bunch of  Starbucks green straws  Has it gotten to the point  Where we feel that  If any depiction  Of two similar  Side by side objects  No  Hey douchebag  This is obviously  Somebody had a smart idea  I bet you that guy  Isn't from New York  Because  New Yorkers see that image 
[01:25:00]  For what it's meant to be  He's from Jersey  A depiction of the whole  Twin Tower thing  Because  Like you said  Aerial views  Of that whole downtown area  Could look like  Blades of grass  And stuff  The buildings  The individual buildings  Don't be an idiot  And dude  I'm not  You know what  This is what this guy  Just did  And this is why  I'm glad  This idiot  Just wrote in  That's exactly  The arrogant  Smug  Technically correct  Line that Starbucks  Is going to give  When everybody knows  What they're trying to say  And I'm a big believer  In freedom of speech 
[01:25:30]  But use common sense  That's just gross  Oh they have the freedom  To put this up  But then everybody  Has the freedom  To call them a bunch  Of scumbags  That's obvious  What that is  If you do a joke  About something  That's one thing  But when you're  Advertising  Across the whole country  And you're trying  To make yourself  An extra 50 million  You're a gross pig company  Look  Collapse into cool  And that arrogant  Stupid argument  About well  You're just going to  See what you want to see  That's the exact  Same type of  Arrogant  Smug jackass  That did the ad  How could you see it  Any other way  It says collapse into cool  Right now 
[01:26:00]  That's their new slogan  Where did that come from  What does that mean  How do you collapse into cool  Collapse into cool  Why did they pull it  If it wasn't  I've had a lot of ice drinks  In my lifetime  I've never felt like  I was collapsing into cool  Collapse into cool  What a  With our big twin tees  The same faggoty city  That cancelled  Their New Year's Eve celebration  A couple of years ago  Because they were afraid  New York didn't cancel  They might blow up the needle  Don't take it out on Seattle 
[01:26:30]  Starbucks is based in Seattle  Yeah  Don't take it out on them  Why we're not on  I'll be nice as soon as we are  We're on tonight  Big deal  Good  We've got the donuts  All right  I threw coffee at the window once  I don't recommend it  We don't know what's going to happen  What is Steve  A faggot  Hey Steve  What happened when you threw the coffee  At the window  Well I pulled up the Dunkin' Donuts  And first of all  I've got to pay close to two friggin dollars  To get a cup of coffee  And the immigrants can never get it right 
[01:27:00]  So I asked this guy for a cup of coffee  Extra milk  Two sugars  He does like three quarters of a cup of cream  So I asked him nicely again to do it  And the second time  He does it exactly the same way  So at the drive-in  I wung the whole cup of coffee  Right back at the guy  Yeah  And needless to say  I'm not allowed back there now  Well of course you're not  What a great story  The beauty of you is that you tried to go back  All right fellas  The show is losing already  And I thought I could help  But obviously  Oh yeah now blame it on us 
[01:27:30]  Don't blame it on us  Shut up  Don't blame the show  I'm a tool  I'm a tool  Take your beating like a man  What does mung mean?  Don't pass the buck  You dicks  Don't blame the rape victim sir  Really?  All right fellas  Look at him  Take it easy  You've got to be brave  And take your beating  If you bomb on this show  I wung the coffee  What does wung mean?  Stupid  He was ready to say  We were asking for his comments  You guys were asking for it  You know it  Wow 
[01:28:00]  I've thrown stuff at  You know  Remember the old  Jack in the Box?  Remember the Jack in the Box  Restaurants late at night?  Restaurant  Oh you mean it's a restaurant?  Slime hole  And you'd get through the drive-thru  And if you didn't like something  Wait a minute  Growing up on Long Island  You didn't know any better  Those were restaurants for us  Oh yeah  Yeah with the breakfast Jack  What was that?  What the hell was on that?  I went to the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant  The taco that looked like  It was filled with baby crap  The Burger King restaurant  And the Jack in the Box restaurant 
[01:28:30]  Restaurant  Oh yeah  Jack in the Box restaurant  Jack in the Box  Great thing to do when a gal is sleeping  Ha ha ha ha  And we were always throwing stuff  At those windows  One thing that pissed me off though  And I wound up throwing  My hot chocolate  At the window of a deli  Around here  I never understood this one  And somebody ought to do something about this  And it still  It still happens every so often  You go in  You get a hot chocolate  A coffee  Or whatever  And there's some  Stupid guinea 
[01:29:00]  Behind the counter  That's wearing  Cologne  He's got his chains  He's got his chains  And he whipped the cologne all on  It's all  I've only seen Italian guys do this  You're a guinea though  I don't care  I'm an American  I don't care  You guys like splashing the cologne on  And then you know what they do?  They fill up the hot chocolate  They take the lid  Push it down  With the cologne still on their friggin' hand  So now every time you go to take a sip of the hot chocolate  The cologne is right up to your nose 
[01:29:30]  I went in  I got a new one  The guy  On purpose  Wiped even more cologne on the lid  Yeah sure  That stupid son of a bitch  So I um  I opened the door  And threw the hot chocolate  I don't know what happened then  I ran so fast  Because it was much bigger than me  But I laughed as I drove away  In my car that was running  With the door open  And you closed the door  And half my hair was sticking out  True 
[01:30:00]  Like a zipper that went up too fast  Jesus  Alright  It's snack time  So we're going to take a break  It's snack time  Yeah  What do you got?  You got your yogurt and your nana?  Aww  Hey can somebody lay down a little rug  And give them some milk  So we can lay down on it?  Your mat?  A little mat  Yes  A little nap mat  A little banana  Hey we all have our problems  My blood sugar level drops around this time every day  But just the fact that you have a healthy treat in each hand  And which one to start with 
[01:30:30]  Who knows?  I'm not pinching my fat gut  No you're right  You are in better shape than me  Alright  That's point made  It's called having a little discipline in your life  I like it too  If it's yellow  A little  Waka waka  Having a little gumption  Here I don't have one ounce of stick-to-itiveness  A little weak-willed nothing  He will pinch his gut and pinch his fat  Look at him  But next time he's out with all of us  Man you're ordering all the desserts and everything  No dude I don't eat that  You eat like a pig  No you're wrong  What is it that puts a couple of pounds on Jimmy? 
[01:31:00]  First of all I have the metabolism of a glacier  I don't eat that much  I mean I eat like actually at home a healthy treat  I like lower fat food  I probably should be in a lot worse shape than I am  But what's been depressing me lately  Is that when I put my pants on  Just the fact that my meat is like hanging over a little bit  Is it starting to like hang over?  A little bit like where I can run my fingers under it  I feel like a little ridge  Yeah  Of fat  A ridge 
[01:31:30]  That's why I want to grab it with pliers and just twist it  I bit myself last night  I was so angry  Let me see this piece of mine  You can't but they were bad  I almost took  If I would have kept going I would have taken out a piece of pleasure  I can totally relate to that  I used to punch walls  And it used to make me feel really much better right?  Yes  After you do it you're so happy even though you hurt yourself  Yeah  You feel better because you hurt yourself  I used to punch brick walls  And then the pain in my hand would be excruciating  I broke a couple knuckles  I'd do the walls  But I would feel so much better 
[01:32:00]  The walls got to give a little  You need like wood or  No  No  It's all about hurting yourself  Yeah  It's all about  It's just that feeling because you're so worthless  And you know it  And you ever look in the mirror and just  Honestly  Have you ever looked in the mirror just to your face and said  You are garbage  Wow  You ever do that?  Make eye contact in the mirror with yourself  And just let yourself know the real truth?  I believe when anyone looks in the mirror and assesses themselves  There are certain pros and cons  You sort through  I don't think the whole thing of just looking in there 
[01:32:30]  And saying that you're despicable is something that's common  Yeah well maybe if you had little lips like a bird's vag  Maybe then you'd want to look in the mirror and say that  I wasn't saying that  I'm just saying that everybody  You know you have your pros and cons  Why don't you have self esteem Jimmy Norton?  I do have some self esteem about certain things  I'm accurate about certain things  I'm a funny person  I'm not dumb  I'm not  I don't  By the way I don't ever fish for compliments  Gee I'm ugly  Wink  No  I'm not believing  Never  And there's nothing worse than some jackass misinterpreting that 
[01:33:00]  Like oh I guess  No stupid  That's not what I'm telling you  I'm just being honest about that little part  That thinks that way  I don't know why to be honest with you  Who knows  Maybe it was a stranger  A transient with a little finger  I don't know why  What happens when you're young  That causes you to think this way  Finger  Who knows  Maybe some stranger walking through  And ah look at him  Plump white round and alone  I'd love to be able to tell you why  I don't know  Have fun looking in the mirror the rest of your life  Yeah I know  You'll be lying on your stomach for a week 
[01:33:30]  Crying and pretending it's just comfortable that way  You know I know this is like wacky radio territory  But we should get some hypnosis for you live on the show  No  Absolutely  Something would pop out  Something is going to pop out  He wouldn't get  No I would never do it  I wouldn't allow it on the air  It's too weird  Something weird might pop out  That would be great radio though man  We'd be just all uncomfortable  As you're admitting all these crazy things  They're actually not as  They're not much more crazy than most people think  I mean they're committed a murder or a rape 
[01:34:00]  I mean nothing more bizarre than most people  I just got the little voice from me is loud  I listen to it a lot  Everyone has it  Have you ever gone to a therapist?  Yeah  Of course  Yes  And I despise most of it  My last one  I really hope he lost his leg in some type of an auto injury  This guy  This will be good for your self esteem  He fell asleep once while I was talking  Oh my god  Your little life wasn't interesting enough for him  And I actually believe  That should have sent me into a knife plunge 
[01:34:30]  Yeah  But I fault him because he was awful  Because you'd go in there  And he would just sit there like a plant  And look at you  And wait for you to talk  Don't use psychology on me  You're boring jerk off  Help!  Help!  Help!  He actually screamed for help  Oh he was the worst  You know  I'll never forget he fell asleep  Oh  And I was asking him one time  We were just talking  I'm trying to be like a guy with him  Yeah  And I'm like  I mean you know  Do you live in New York or New Jersey?  I wasn't asking where  He said  Oh I don't think you need to know that  All right  Yeah I'm going to stalk you  You bearded zilch  It's just annoying me 
[01:35:00]  Maybe he thought that  It should be  Psychiatrist  Patient relationship  It was  We're both people  And he was such a dull zero  I had nothing to say to him  Yeah  So what do I talk about this week  While you stare at me  Fall asleep  Exactly  Yeah he just dozed off  Do you remember what you were telling him  No I really don't  I mean I'm a bore  I acknowledge that  It probably could have happened to any man  Hey guys  Were you talking in this voice?  Hey how you doing?  We'll get that tape  Hey guys  I'm really starting to shake  Can we break? 
[01:35:30]  Oh  Oh  That's right  Your little blood sugar's dropping?  You wouldn't believe it  You should see him  He's already stirring the yogurt  No I'm not  Look  It's already stirring  Oh what kind of yogurt do you have?  Light and fit  Ooh  What flavor?  Lemon chiffon  Does that come with a yam bag  To plop in your mouth  When you're done?  That stinks  Chiffon  Lemon chiffon  With a pair of pumps  And some nice drapes  It's standing  I don't care what it is  Lemon chiffon  Should shoot out of a helmet shaped object 
[01:36:00]  All over your back and face  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show  What's going to happen since the commercial break?  I thought you'd come in all happy  Because you  AOL will not send my mail  I swear to God  I'm getting an error thing  As I'm trying to reply to mail  You are a mess  By the way  All the people  And I love you guys  For trying my mailing list  The reason you haven't gotten anything  Is because  Scumbag  C word

Piazza's hot  Yeah in the New York paper  There's a picture of Mike Piazza  Without his shirt on 
[01:37:00]  With a bat over his shoulder  You know this is ridiculous  Because he was just saying  I'm not gay  This picture  It would be less gay  If the bat was in his A  It's the gayest picture  Ever  I think he's also capitalizing  On the tragedy  Because they said his mule  Is 9 inches by 11  Jesus  Who put the eye  Heart with the arrow  Through it  Men  Tattoo on his arm 
[01:37:30]  Who do you think?  Rick?  Yeah  Ah  Julie what's up?  Hey guys  I just wanted to tell Norton  That he's inspired me  Why?  Because a couple months ago  I heard him go on  One of those  Basically saying  About how bad he felt  About himself  Because of his weight  And what not  And I really identified  With him  Because I'm very  Overweight myself  And so far  I've lost 40 pounds  Oh 40 or 20?  40  Oh congratulations  What big a gal are you?

[01:38:30]  It is just a big mass  Shove together  It's not the weight  I never complained  About the weight  It's just my belly  And my breasts  And they're soft  And what's the word  Ectomorphic  I think that's what I is  That's what I is  What is that  I think that's what I is  What is it  Ectomorphic  Yeah what does that mean  It just means  I think it's a very low  Muscle tone  I think that's  I think I'm an ectomorph  You have the muscle tone  Of a veal  Have you ever worked down  Your whole life  Yeah I  You don't understand  My buddy Rush  Who's in really good shape

[01:52:30]  We might actually  You know  Even though we don't want to  We might have to keep her  Around on the show  For a little bit  And then after Friday  When you  I'm standing there  And there's a bunch  Of fans of the show  And you're just  No  No  No  It's not like  You were going home  On a date that night  Marion doesn't mind  Being a complete ass  Just to be funny  And yet  Marion is great on the show  She is great  You don't have to tell anyone that  They know that  Yeah  Okay well  I know she is  You know she's my best friend 
[01:53:00]  And all  But she is great on the show  She is great on the show  Listen with your fat head  You should have a lit candle  In your mouth  A lit candle?  Why?  Because that's like  A pumpkin reference  A pumpkin reference  That's why  You can't figure out  A pumpkin reference  I know what a pumpkin reference is  I know what that is  Let's play explain it to Lady Di  You see your head is really big and round  It kind of looks like a pumpkin  So if Jim says you should have a candle 
[01:53:30]  In your mouth  Do you get it?  Yes  Ox  Oh man  A movie on this flight  Yeah Jethro  Jethro brings up a good point on line three  It's called earning your keep  And for some reason Lady Di  Doesn't want to earn her keep  You didn't want to do it  We finally found an angle for you  And you decided in front of a lot of people  That you weren't going to do it  I just didn't want to do it last night  Because I was dressed up  I was talking to my friends  There's certain friends that I have down there 
[01:54:00]  And I just  You thought you looked good  You are such a crock  You thought you looked good  Ever since you starred in Home Alone  You have had an attitude  Home Alone?  Forget it  It's another one that went over your fat head  Why don't you explain the Home Alone thing to her?  Yeah  Shut up  I will explain it to you  And they should fill your mouth with water  And then just drop it over that forest fire  Oh jeez  Your head is really big like Devin's  So therefore I had to make mention  Of the fact that you starred in Home Alone  You should mention Devin in this  I like Devin 
[01:54:30]  Devin wouldn't mind doing something  Devin is great  He is great  But he wouldn't mind doing something to be funny  He wouldn't stand there in a stupid 1907 dress  And then stupid pilgrim shoes  And go ah I'm trying to look hot  He wouldn't mind doing something funny?  Who me?  When is that going to happen?  Oh wow  You talking to Jim?  Oh my god  Shut up  You're so friggin stupid  See Lady Di  I knew Devin was listening  So I took a little shot at him  As a joke  Because we're all friends  Oh okay  Yeah  I can't believe we have to explain everything 
[01:55:00]  Devin is a great guy  I was standing there in my dress  After voting for Coolidge  And I decided that I wanted to  Talk to my friends  And not put on the funny mustache  Alright  Do you understand that one?  That one I understood  Do you really?  What does it mean?  What does it mean?  Well that means I didn't put on the funny mustache at Hooters  You really are  Oh my god  Oh my god  I just didn't feel like it  No you see Coolidge was a president  Help me with the year  I want to say  Whatever  I want to say  Yeah okay 
[01:55:30]  And your outfit kind of  Looked like the time period  That Coolidge was running for office  Right  Okay  So you went in the voting booth  And you voted for Coolidge  And  No you didn't get it  No you didn't  You didn't get it  Because you don't listen  You're incapable of listening  You're always just talking  And saying nothing  You don't want to be part of the show  Why don't you just say it?  I never said I didn't want to be part of the show  Yes you did  I never said that  Actions speak louder than words  Actions speak louder than words  What do you want me to do now? 
[01:56:00]  Your Don asked you to do him a favor  And you refused  Ah  Now it's going to take a little ride  Yeah you stood there  And pledged your loyalty  While the kids ran around  With your Luca Brasi body  So you're telling me  If I put that mustache on  At Hooters  I would still be  Oh that was  That was pretty much  You know why?  It would have shown  That you  You want to contribute  And do something  You did nothing  You stunk up the place  You would have gotten a laugh  And an applause  From an audience  And  You see how many people were there?  I was talking to people 
[01:56:30]  I don't know  Oh stop it  You don't think  Anybody that was talking to you  Would have preferred  To see you with that  God damn mustache on?  Well that  I have no idea  Of course they would have  There's no other reason  To talk to you  Besides it was black  It might have made you  Look thinner  Thanks Jim  What does that mean?  Well I had a navy blue dress on  Which almost looked  Like a black dress  So  No it didn't  You saw that?  Black makes fat girls  Look thinner  Oh you saw that  That's right  What am I saying?  It looked like a big blue 
[01:57:00]  Awful Volkswagen  With frills  Well you know  I try to dress up  Every once in a while  No you don't  Try to dress up  Stop trying to dress up  In the early 1900s  Put on a mini strip  I just bought that dress  Little advice lady  If you drive a crappy car  Don't honk your horn  Okay?  Well my car  Is not exactly a new car  But you know  Oh my gosh  It's halfway decent  You don't even know  It's 1984  You didn't even know  What that meant  Okay if I drive a crappy car  What?  Nothing  You awful shell-less turtle 
[01:57:30]  Oh come on  You know what you should do  Lay an egg into a leaf  A nice little leathery egg  Into a big leaf  And then crawl back  Into the ocean  When you drive a crappy car  You don't want to  Bring attention to it  So you wouldn't be  You wouldn't honk your horn  Because then people  Would turn around  And go oh wow  Look at the crappy car  Get it?  Oh okay crappy car  Okay  But a crappy car  Is better than no car at all  Well no  Right?  No  No  Stop trying to take lemons  And make lemonade  Stupid  That's what I'm trying to do 
[01:58:00]  With my car right now  Do you know what  The lemons and lemonade thing means?  It's a 1984 Firebird  Do you know what  That's my car  Do you know what  The lemons and lemonade thing means?  Who cares?  The lemons and lemonade  Do you know what it means?  I kind of do  No you don't  What does that mean?  Well that means  Buy a new car  No it doesn't  No it doesn't  Well actually  I plan on doing that  No one cares  You have the perception  Of an autistic  No I don't  Cut it out 
[01:58:30]  Lady Di  You're really stupid  Yeah  You're really not  An intelligent woman  Are you?  You have no  Attention span  What so ever  Yeah  Yes I do  You can't listen to others  The girl's about as sharp  As a bowling ball  And you refuse to do the one thing  That would have made a whole room full of people laugh  Well yeah  Would that have made things any better  If I did that?  Of course it would have  Of course  Don't you understand?  I drew a mustache on my face  At Hooters?  It would have showed that you were trying to be funny and part of the team 
[01:59:00]  And make people laugh  Right  Like I had some motivation and ambition to be on this show  Maybe they could have made some type of a shirt with you on it  Or had some type of a sound bite that fit you like they did for Marion  Because they finally found something that fit Marion  But you didn't want that  Let me tell you something about Marion  Okay  Right now she's at the gym  Okay  And she is really, you know, trying to lose weight  She is losing weight  Is she being photographed in the before section of the poster?  No  Hey, I like Marion  Leave her alone  I like Marion too 
[01:59:30]  Exactly  She should just stand there naked  And motivate everyone to do push-ups and sit-ups  Marion loves herself  Loves her body  Has a lot of self-esteem  And she knows  Marion knows it makes her funny  At first I hated Marion  But  I can't wait right now  Because it's something that  The more I  Shut up  The more I've hung out with Marion  I respect her a lot  Yeah  Without a doubt  She's a mess  But she doesn't care that she's a mess  No, she's not a mess  Mark wants to say that Lady Di sounds as smart as she is thin  As what? 
[02:00:00]  Exactly  Okay, good  What does that mean, Lady Di?  She sounds as smart as she is thin  What would that mean?  That means he thinks I'm dumb  Pretty obvious  And fat  No, well, whatever  How to clear that up  You were laughing in the background  Everybody  Everyone laughs at you  Yeah, and you could have got a big laugh doing something genuinely funny  Right  And you turned it down  No, I'm talking 
[02:00:30]  And for the first time in your life  People would have been laughing with you  Oh, God  Now what do I do?  Now what do you do?  Right  We'll tie ropes to your nose  And take you to Lakehurst  And watch you blow up  Watch me blow up?  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  Oh, Jesus  Hey, maybe you could let me  Would you be comfortable with this?  What's that?  Maybe we could take an ox heart  Oh, an ox heart  Oh, no  What?  Uh-oh  Oh, you blew the line 
[02:01:00]  Oh, boy  I was just going to say  Maybe we could take an ox heart  And then we could  Please  That's funny  But we can't use that language, Jimmy  Oh, my God  That didn't make the air, did it?  Shut up  No, so stupid  Good  Obviously, Einstein  And you couldn't make the air  With a rocket strapped to your back  Jesus  Oh, that's hilarious  What did that one mean, Lady Di?  What did that mean, Lady Di?  Peter  All right, hold on 
[02:01:30]  Hold on one second  Uh-oh  Go  No, no, no  You can't do it right now  Go  My son  I'm sorry  Go ahead  He wants to watch TV  Let him watch TV  He can watch TV  He can watch it in his room  You're overbearing bitch  I'm on the phone  Let him watch TV  I'm on the phone  What do you want to watch?  Do you want to watch some of your older films?  All right, he wants to watch TV  Go ahead, watch TV  Go ahead  Okay  What do you want?  I'm on the phone with you guys  All right  Well, here's the deal 
[02:02:00]  I think we're going to put a poll up on OPM  Oh, here we go  Okay  Lady Di, I'll be honest  We were going to  We weren't even going to put it to a vote  Yep  We thought the whole  Oliver Hardy thing was beyond hilarious  Something, by the way  We came up with and not you  But obviously  It wasn't important enough to you  And you have no clue about  People that I know  Shut up  Shut up  Shut up  You know why?  Because there was a whole bunch of fans of this show there  That were chanting  They wanted you to do it  They wanted to see it 
[02:02:30]  It would have been a good laugh  It would have shown me  That you wanted to be part of the show  Instead, you left me out there  To drive  Look what Voss did  And I brought a tape in  And Voss had a tape  He let us rip on  What did Voss do?  He let us bring a tape of him in  And rip on him  And Voss didn't act like a baby  He laughed about it  We all teased him  It was funny  And I'm going to do the same thing  With my awful tape  See?  But you wouldn't get in the barrel  And put a little mustache on  Because your stupid  Hen house friends were there?  No, it's not even that  What friends of yours were there? 
[02:03:00]  Who were you talking to?  He put a mustache on  And talking to people  Shut up, stupid  What were you talking to?  Why?  You don't mind talking to him  With 400 extra pounds on your frame?  Oh, man  What friends of yours were there?  Well, there was a few friends down there  No, you're lying  Which ones?  Name them  I'm not naming any names  There weren't any  You're lying  There weren't any  No, there were not  What friends?  Why can't you name them?  They're not CIA employees  Well, one of them is Marion  She was down there with me  Right, I know Marion was there  And I don't think she would have been too happy 
[02:03:30]  If I was walking around  With a mustache on me  Marion?  I don't think she would have been happy about it  Well, you know, I'm just saying  She probably wouldn't have been happy about that  You really?  Are you that stupid that you think that  No, no, no, no  I'm just saying  She probably wouldn't have  Don't just say  Think before you just say  Okay  She wouldn't have  You were worried about  You cared this little about Opie and Anthony  That you wouldn't put a mustache on  Because you were afraid  That another monstrosity would be angry with you?  No  No, no, no  She's my best friend  And I don't know  I don't think that, you know  Why?  Do you get mad at her for her sound bite 
[02:04:00]  Or her shirt?  You don't get mad at her  Why would she walk in?  Hey, lady, die  I have not had anything  Hey, lady, die  Yes  Is your son watching you right now  Thinking he's watching Operation Dumbo Drop?  Right now, he's watching the Rugrats right now  He's watching the Rugrats on television right now  That's what he's watching  Hurricane Hippo  No, he's watching the Rugrats  Hurricane Hippo Power  His other favorite character is Spongebob 
[02:04:30]  What?  His other favorite character is Spongebob  Ugh  Squarepants  Yeah, Squarepants Mom  Squarepants  Squarepants  Squarepants Mom  Right  Sponge-ass, Squarepants Mom  Should she stay or should she go?  The poll is up on Opie and Anthony  Here we go, the song  Should I Stay or Should I Go?  No, stupid  No one's playing that awful, hulky song  No one  It's not an awful song  It stinks and so do you 
[02:05:00]  You had a chance to be funny for O&A  They asked you to do something  Poor Ant's on the air  Do you think he wants to be on the air today?  Sick and spraying chloroceptic and mule juice every 20 seconds  Anthony, how are you feeling today?  Shut up  Are you okay?  I don't even  I won't even acknowledge you  Oh, okay  I heard you were kind of sick yesterday, so  This isn't just echoing  Marion might have been mad at me  No, no, no  I'm not saying that she might have  What are you saying?  I'm not saying that she may have been 
[02:05:30]  Stop lying and hiding behind her  Theoretically as impossible as that sounds  I am not hiding behind anything  I'm just saying that I can feel like walking around  With the little mustache and hooters  That's all  Why not?  Why?  Why?  Why?  I don't know  Tell me how you do know  You like it at that time  Why?  You don't mind walking around with a stupid Asian haircut  Why would you mind walking around with a little mustache to match it?  That haircut looked good on Pete Rose  On Pete Rose?  And Bruce Lee  Asians and Pete Rose should have that haircut, not you 
[02:06:00]  And Moe Howard of the Three Stoops  And Moe Howard  And Mary from the Little Rascals  Well, that's what you guys said  Oh, you really are an ass  Alright, it's time to usher you into the silent room  The silent room  The one shot you had  It was a live event  Yep  I talk about my fat, awful belly  And my meaty breasts  To make people laugh  I know, I hear you  And you wouldn't shot it stupid  And you wouldn't take the bullet 
[02:06:30]  For Ann and Oak  Why wouldn't you?  See it?  I can see if he said to do something that was going to hurt you  Where he'd take off your clothes  And you said, you know, whatever  This was drawing a little mustache  That everyone knew what the bit was  And you couldn't even do that  So  We leave it up to the audience now  There'll be more events  There'll be more  Oh, not for you  You blew it  With that awful hair, dude  The only thing you're going to do is sit on a paint can with wooden shoes  A paint can with what? 
[02:07:00]  I know, you don't get it  No need to say it  Wouldn't shoes?  Forget it  All her friends that were there  Like a little Dutch boy?  She named Marion  Yeah, all my friends were there  And Marion  My friends  Well, there were  No, no, no  They were our friends  And they were down there  Oh, stop it  You were afraid of looking bad in front of them?  I didn't say anything  Marion wouldn't be mad at your mustache  Because she can't say mustache  My friend  She wouldn't  Say mustache?  She can say whatever she wants to say 
[02:07:30]  Then why would you  Why wouldn't you do it for the boys?  I just  I just did not feel like doing that  Why?  You're not giving a reason  I did it all day  You know what?  That day  Then I just don't feel like having it around anymore  You don't seem to have the motivation  I think I have the conversation between her and Marion that night  What was that?  Hold on, hold on 
[02:08:00]  What was that?  It's whales communicating, you stupid trots  Oh, whales communicating, come on  What does that mean?  Huh?  Okay, Charlie, this is what the whales are saying  Okay, okay  Brian, ring a bit  What is Lady Di doing?  She's leading us out to sea  I'm not leading us out to sea  There it is  He's lonely 
[02:08:30]  I am what?  No, we're not talking about you anymore  Oh, okay  We're referring to a Brian Regan bit  We're talking about an animal  I love Brian Regan  I think he's cool  Shut up  When you go to any event  Do you notice that people just try to get away from you?  Like when we're having conversations  When we go to any event  I mean a party, anything  Not to do with this show  I mean just anything you do in any social life you might have  What am I, crazy? 
[02:09:00]  She doesn't have any social life  No  No, we go to the event and we watch the show  So Marion, how much do the Mets pay you for the home games?  Uh, Lady Di?  Yes  How much do the Mets pay you for the home games?  The Mets?  Yeah  You mean the Yankees, right?  No, the Mets  No, the Mets don't pay me anything  It was a Mr. Mets reference  Another one  Oh, okay  What does that mean?  Mr. Mets  And the mascot has a really big  Right  Round head  So I thought  Well, we know the mascot has a really big round head 
[02:09:30]  You should be running through a British subway station  With a burlap mask over your face  Why?  Because you're an ass  Hello  I have not an animal or a team player  All right, well, the poll's up on opanthony.com  Is it?  Yeah  People want to laugh  People would have enjoyed you if you'd done something to make them laugh  And they would have enjoyed it if I put a mustache on me at Hooters  Yeah, because it's comedy  This is not the Rush Limbaugh show or some serious political discussion 
[02:10:00]  It's comedy, and that would have been funny  So Lady Di, how hard is it to balance on that big red ball?  How hard is it to what?  Oh, God  How did you even make it this far?  Very hard  In life  How did you even get this far?  I just do  Hold on, hold on  Turn that down, Peter, please  Oh, don't abuse the kid  I'm not abusing him  I'm just telling him to turn down the television set 
[02:10:30]  Go ahead  If he doesn't turn it down, you should walk over there and give his face a good smack  No, no, leave my kid out of this, come on  Oh, please  My kid is all right  All right, get a hold of yourself  Okay, no problem  He probably has a higher IQ than you  He probably, I think he does  He has a very high IQ, he's a very smart kid  All right, does he love you?  Does he love you?  Of course he loves me  And he's not  Huh?  What do you mean?  I just voted  Be nice now 
[02:11:00]  I just voted  What did you vote, Anthony?  On our poll  He voted  What did you vote?  To get rid of you  No  Oh, yes, he did  I can't see the results  They should have the results posted  Lady Di, we'll get back to you  Okay, I guess you're going to have to get back to me, I don't know  Oh, God  What does that mean?  Nothing  Well, you know, there's only one thing I don't understand  How is there going to be Laverne and Shirley without Laverne? 
[02:11:30]  Call it something else  It doesn't have to be Laverne and Shirley  Yeah, we'll just team her up with somebody else  Oh  They do that all the time in the movies and stuff  Yeah  They never explain why the Bewitched guy changed  Or blow on All My Children  He'll be like Dick York  Happy Days moved on when they got rid of the older son  Yep  And no one even noticed  Actually  Chuck or whatever his name was, right?  Well  I don't know what to say about that  Of course you don't  No, you don't know what to say about anything  That would require a thought process  That doesn't just involve open, chew, swallow 
[02:12:00]  The what?  Lady Di, I'm going to give you  Say something intelligent to us  Say something intelligent  Show us a little bit  Of intelligence  Of intelligence  Of knowledge  Of a subject  Anything  I will give you a simple question  It could be anything  Give me a simple question  What do you know?  What do I know?  The question  I know quite a bit  Stop repeating it  What do you know?  I'm a high school graduate  I know quite a bit  What do you know, though?  Give us something 
[02:12:30]  Something interesting that you know  Oh, what do I know?  Let's see  Something interesting  Well, I know the Beatles' birthdays  That requires a lot of smarts  Well, everyone knows that McCartney's 60 today, I think  Or yesterday  I'll tell you why you know that  Because you have the same haircut they did  As a matter of fact, yes, he is 60 today  Today, June 18, 1942  That's when he was born  Thank you for stepping on that line, rain cow  That's not really  George Harrison's birthday was February 27, 1943 
[02:13:00]  Really?  When did the brain tumor start?  The what?  Forget it  Oh, God  I don't think about things like that  That's why there is no God  George Harrison's brain is eaten away by cancer  And you continue to breathe  Look, look  I know that  Lady Di, tell us a little something  Tell us a little something maybe about American history  American history  Yeah, go ahead  Give us something  I didn't know that  Since the Indians used to hunt you for food and pelt  That was a long time ago, Jim 
[02:13:30]  That was a long time ago  But they did not succeed  Because I'm still around right now  What was he getting at there?  About the Indians hunting for food and kelp?  No, kelp  That's not kelp  That was a long time ago  They were getting kelp from a buffalo, you ask  That's where they get kelp from, a buffalo  What were they hunting?  Well, they were hunting for food, obviously  Well, what?  Well, they were hunting for anything  They were hunting for food and, you know, survival  Why would I reference you in that sentence? 
[02:14:00]  I have a funny feeling I know why  So let's hear it  If you have a funny feeling, please, for the first time, ever share it  Something about shooting for whales, you were saying?  How do you...  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus Christ  American Indians hunted for whales?  They probably did  You have the humor of a Night's Walker trial transcript  They were hunting for other things, you know, like food  Is it true when you were walking down the train tracks and you met the train 
[02:14:30]  They drove a golden spike between the two of you?  No  I don't remember that  Let's check it out a little more American history  You know nothing  The American Indians...  First of all, an American train and Indians...  I don't think trains were around back then  Oh, my God  The trains were not around by...  The American Indians were hunting like bison or buffalo  You truly know nothing  And didn't Magellan get a high five when he ran around you once?  Well, you know, let me tell you something right now  It's been a long time since I've been in school 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, but I'm not even talking about school stuff  Just give us one bit of knowledge  Some information that you might have  Besides celebrity birthdays  I'm talking about anything  History  Anything  What do you know about American history?  Chemistry  Physics  What do I know about American history?  Yeah, let's go  Okay, let's see  That's the nervous line  This is going to be a tough one for me  Stop with the nervous chitter and get to it 
[02:15:30]  Not...  You know, let me tell you something right now  I'm going to think about all these things after I get off the phone  Well, think about them while you're on the phone  No, you're not  You're an American  What do you know about American history?  We could get a stupid cabbie on the phone  And he would tell us ten things  Awesome  A cabbie would tell you ten things on the phone?  About American history?  Stop repeating and stalling  How did it feel when the Mayflower hit you?  Just wonderful  What's the Mayflower?  The Mayflower is a boat  How about some mathematics or something? 
[02:16:00]  It's one of the boats  It's one of the Santa Maria  Oh my God, it is not  You stupid bitch  It is not  The Mayflower  The Nina, the Pinna, and the Santa Maria  Are the Columbus boats  Christopher Columbus boats  Yeah  He discovered America  Back in 18...  Come on  90  All right, you know what?  Lady Di, get the...  18 what?  Come on, it's been a long time since I've been in the...  You could train over  You could be the stupidest human being 
[02:16:30]  Yes, yes  You are retarded  You're retarded  And every time we wanted to kick her off for the show for good  Now we have something else to explore  I'm amazed by her stupidity  How about...  You know, you're hitting me with these questions right now  And I have these questions  I want our listeners to take all this under consideration  Think before you make your decision  Okay  Now listen  Think people  Think  Do you know any mathematics at all?  Any mathematics?  No, it's better with this history stuff, man  She thinks Columbus discovered America somewhere in the 1800s 
[02:17:00]  In the 1800s  In the 1800s  Yeah  After Lincoln freed the slaves, Columbus showed up  Yeah, good point  Oh, I'm sorry, 1492  What am I saying 1892 for?  Lady Di  Wait, who did we fight in World War II?  Who did we fight in World War II?  Germany  Who else?  Germany and Italy  Florida, yeah  Florida, okay  And I know that  Who else?  I know that for...  The foreign countries 
[02:17:30]  Germany, Italy  And...  The foreign countries  Well, yeah  It's a pretty big one  All right, a big one  I mean, it was a pretty...  I don't know  You know, that name I'm just throwing off right now  You're missing the big one  Yeah, you're missing the one  The World War II Germany  That's who we fought  Who did we fight?  Who attacked us?  Who attacked us?  Who started World War I?  Pearl Harbor  Yes, Pearl Harbor attacked us  No, no, no  Our own ships turned on us 
[02:18:00]  Japan, Japan, Japan  Japan bombed Pearl Bailey  Yeah, David has a good point on Line 9  Dress her up like a parachute  She repeats everything  She only knows  She knows the Beatles and Japanese  You only know things  That apply to your hairdo  I know about rock and roll  I know about the Beatles  And the monkeys  Of course you can  Oh, that's too easy  Yeah  All of that stuff  All right  All the stuff I grew up with  All right, Lady Di  We're done with you for today  Yeah  Okay  We encourage everyone  To go to opianthony.com  To vote if she should stay or go 
[02:18:30]  Yeah  Okay  All right, thanks, Lady Di  Okay  Take care, guys  Lady Di  Yes?  Bye  Back to your work  Back to the lab  Trying to cure that cancer  People think  That age cure  People think before you vote  That's all I have to say  I don't want to influence anyone  But I just want people to  Think before they vote  She could be the dumbest person ever  Is 
[02:19:00]  And she has no  I mean  I'm already thinking  We've got to bring her in here  And give her a little test  And I'm talking like  A little quiz  Not even just not knowing things  Because you can be ignorant  But be very intelligent  You just don't know the stuff  Because you never learned it  But she is just a blithering idiot  And she  She  That parrot thing is great  Dress her up as a parrot  And talk to her  Dress me up as a parrot  And talk to me  Yeah  You get in a parrot suit  I get in a parrot suit 
[02:19:30]  Just don't try to paint a little mustache  On her beach  Polly want 20 pizzas  Hurricane  Hippo  And he would blow the balloon away  I used to love that stupid cartoon  Completely not even  You can't blow your own balloon away like that  Yeah because  Every action is an equal and opposite reaction  And unless he was out of the basket  Oh we should have presented that one to Lady Di 
[02:20:00]  What do you mean  You're saying that he was in the balloon  And he would blow it  He was in the gondola  Of the balloon  And he would go  And the balloon would go  Whoosh  Off into that direction  You raise a good point about the physics  Although you're missing the fact  That hippos don't normally operate gondolas with balloons  Or talk  So there's a lot of flaws in that theory  They do raise children though  And call on the phone occasionally  We're in break so long I fell asleep  I know  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show 
[02:20:30]  We like explaining  We did like an hour and I think 20 minutes of radio straight  Straight through without a break  And unfortunately that's the other side of it  We have to kind of catch up with things  So sorry about that  It's ONA  Dan has a quick comment here  Before we move on to other things  Dan what's up  Hey dude how you doing  Alright  Hey listen  You know after that performance  You guys have got to keep her  She is so stupid  She is so much fun to F with  You guys should have

[02:21:30]  It's a landslide right now  I know I was going to say  Check it out  She is so incredibly stupid  Even this way  She says how everybody has a computer  So she should know what they're voting  Because the results are on the effing computer  Yeah and it's looking really ugly right now  Yeah it is  But just think about all the fun we could have  In the near future with Lady Diaphobe  Absolutely  Yeah I'm thinking she's so incredibly stupid  And for some reason we never picked that up  Well we picked up that she wasn't really smart  But I never realized how stupid she is  Anthony so far 
[02:22:00]  1,300 people have voted  Oh my god  Yes she's a fine asset to the program  210 people have voted for that  No that means 210 people hit the wrong button  And then no she sucks  And should be wiped from my brain  1,107  Eighty-four percent of them have voted so far  Saying Di needs to go  That's what happens when you're not  In the first 20 minutes of voting  Yeah but you know you guys got to be like the judge

[02:23:00]  Tom what's up  Hey  I caught before I waved to get off like a half hour  Just to tell you when she was on there  That I hated that bitch so much  Yeah  She like makes my skin crawl  Yeah  But then listening to her  It's like now I'm like you can't get rid of her  Because she's a freaking retard  Yeah  I mean she's like the  Is there anyone on the show that she doesn't like  Every single god damn time you said  Anyone's next  Oh yeah he's great I love him  He's good  Jesus Christ 
[02:23:30]  And you know what else she is a tremendous liar  She is such a liar  That poor kid  Absolutely  She's not in her kid  Jesus Christ  What does she lie about  We'll leave the kid out of it  Everything  Later  Whenever you ask her something like you know  Oh what I like the ideas that she was supposed to come up with  Well what other ideas do you have  Well I have a few  Oh which ones  Nothing  And she had nothing  And she doesn't  Or what friends were down there  Oh I had friends that were down there 
[02:24:00]  Who  Name them  Oh I'm not going to name them  What  Like there's no reason not to  Stop trying to be mysterious  Just because you have a body like Colonel Kurtz  Spanky what's up  A fat girl on the end  Hey what's up  Our second call from Columbus today  How are you doing Spank  I'm doing good  Alright  I was going to say that  Listening to that lady  To try to figure out those jokes  Is more depressing  To listen to  Baby seals being clubbed at ground zero  Jesus  Ouch  Why would seals go to a club 
[02:24:30]  That's funny  Alright  Jim wants to bring up something here  Yes Jim  Yeah no I hate to defend that cow  But yeah  The Indians  What whale is  Alright hold on though Jim  She's  We said shooting  I mean the Indians  Oh shoot  Alright  The Indians weren't running down the beach  Shooting their whales  Alright granted  Granted  It was such an obvious bison  It was a buffalo joke  Buffalo joke  And she thought the Indians were shooting whales  Alright 
[02:25:00]  Who said whales before  Her stupidity just happened to  Like if you put a hundred monkeys in a typewriter  Eventually they'll type out an intelligent word  That's what happened  Alright I'm going to punch out boys  Yeah when she said  They hunt the bison for their kelp  Exactly  That gave her away  I mean Jesus  She's so close to  Like she's really close to being  The type of retarded  Where you can't live alone anymore  She means  She's right on the edge  Constant care  She's right on the edge  Yeah  Put a big fat adult diaper on her  With calm her stupid  Straight Chinese hair  How are ya 
[02:25:30]  She lives alone  But the family has to check up on her  All the time  Yeah  But she thinks she's living alone  Right  She eats everything  Everybody says  Oh gosh  What a mess  I know  This show is such a mess  We don't talk about anything  No  What is wrong with us  We were supposed to talk about the J-Lo and the sex tape  I know  And we had some great Chelsea Clinton stuff  Drunk in Chelsea again  She should be advising the president like Chelsea Gardner  Sometimes it takes me a while Jim 
[02:26:00]  I don't know  I'm thinking Phil  I got the John List one earlier  Um  No  Nothing  Someone out there got it though  I guarantee  All plenty  And then we'd catch crap for it  Yeah  Nah but if you didn't see something  It's not a matter of not getting it  You don't see it  You don't see it  No  We can all get together in the office after  And take off our clothes  And talk it over  Rob what's up  Hey I just wanted to say that in that whole debacle  You missed the fact that Norton was talking about one life but to live 
[02:26:30]  Or one day at a time or some crap  I don't know which soap I was talking about  My mom used to watch the soap that had Bo and he changed  And I couldn't think of the reference  And I'm glad I couldn't  Days of our lives  Well good  You know what  I'm glad I screwed it up  That proves I don't watch soap  But thank you for Yellow Miata getting that immediately  Bo and Hope  Yeah no look  The only guys that should know that are gay men and prisoners  Or guys that do afternoon radio shows  And they're stuck at home waiting to go into work  And there's nothing else on TV 
[02:27:00]  Wrong  Wrong  Really?  Wrong  I don't anymore  I used to  You didn't have money so you played video games  No it was before really computers  Before any good computers anyway  By the way we do have a really good idea for Lady Di  Before we decide  What's going to happen to her  What caliber weapon does it involve  Well you guys are going to  The listeners are going to decide  But we're going to throw one more thing at you  Before the final decision is made  How is this an idea  To do a political protest 
[02:27:30]  She lays on the train tracks  And lets her legs be severed by a train  Carrying nuclear weapons  Or she sets herself on fire  And protests in the Middle East  When she said Columbus discovered America  Sometime in the 1800s  Oh what a total idiot  And there were no trains when there were Indians  You know what  At that point though  I was digging it  I'm thinking to myself  You know what  We're crazy to let her go  And the Mayflower being part of the Nina Pinta  And the Santa Maria  Yeah no it was a  It was one of the boats right  Yeah 
[02:28:00]  Yeah  It was Pearl Harbor  I like the fact that Pearl Harbor attacked us  Yeah Pearl Harbor attacked us  They just turned on us  Our own military  Started attacking Honolulu  That was great stuff  Come on  Alright  Oh I need that bit  Rick was getting together some stuff for Best Of  I mean you know the weekend show and stuff  Yeah  And he found  And I forgot about this  He found Frenchy losing a fight  A verbal fight  Oh yeah  Alright this is when Dice was in 
[02:28:30]  Yeah this was the only time that Frenchy lost a verbal fight I believe  And he would have lost it worse if it was physical  Yeah  Yeah we had Dice in here  And Frenchy thought he could hang with Dice  And he called up  And Happy Face got the best of Frenchy  Happy Face  This was making us laugh really hard in the back room  So we figured we'd throw it out real fast  Frenchy losing  The only time  Shut your mouth  Oh no who's this  Oh no 
[02:29:00]  Frenchy  Are you doing  It's Frenchy Dice  I want to say hello to the  Jim Norton  The man of the show today  Okay  Are you doing Jim  You're the legend  Oh  It's a French Dice  Hey Dice  How you doing  You fuck bastard  Let me tell you something  Why don't you shut your mouth  Alright  Let me tell you something  Why don't you shut your mouth  And give him some respect  Why don't you get off the phone

[02:32:30]  He also learned a good way to tell if something is funny  Is if Lady Di doesn't get it  And finally, Lady Di is to smart as Rich Voss is to funny  Oh, Voss isn't even here today  Come on  Voss is supposed to be doing some interesting things for us for this radio show  I hope we get that done soon  We came up with some really good things for Voss  It could be really, really funny  Sheep Lover from Jersey  I learned today the Scooby-Doo movie was like a rock concert

How you doing, guys?  Well, this might cheer you up  I think the scientific community will be forever in your debt today 
[02:34:30]  Due to Jim Norton  And we've always known that the law of physics that says  For every action is an equal and opposite reaction  But that is only second to the fact that hippos cannot talk or navigate gondolas  We did learn that  Thank you, sir  That was a very valid point I made  Yes  Hey, Chris, what did you learn on the show today?  Hi, Shmoopies  I learned Norton's lips are as thin as a bird's vag  That made it through  Nice  Ying Yang Party  Ying Yang Party

Today I learned that when Norton decides to hang himself  He'll have to call a real man to get advice on how to tie the knot  Oh, imagine that  You finally decide to hang yourself  You put the rope around something and it just comes off the wall  And you're laying on your living room floor naked going, ah, you stink 
[02:36:00]  My pale fish belly on my parquet floor  The noose around your neck, but it didn't stick  Still no sex appeal lying there with my little plump, pale-ass cheeks  Mr. Blonde from Belmont  I learned today Lady Di was in Rain Cow  And he also learned the Indians hunted kelp  Out of front of a bison  The kelp

Well, I learned that stick-to-it-iveness is a new word  And also, ah  What is a word?  What's the other one?  I forget, I suck  Hey, I love you, Scott 
[02:37:00]  Love you, Ben  Good job  Jim has a new one that was beyond hilarious  Yeah  And we forgot to talk about it when we were doing the car chase stuff  Like the TV is to my left here up high  And so Jim walks all the way around the counter to watch the car chase  Yeah  And everyone is crowded around the TV to watch it  And he'll casually try to hold, like, guys' hands and, like, put his arm around them  And the reaction that he gets from these guys is hilarious 
[02:37:30]  Yeah  You just place your hands sometimes on them  Like, on their bare skin  But he did it so casually, like, you know, you're hanging with your sister  You don't notice right away  And he's putting a friendly hand on her shoulder or something  He does it to guys and then reacts  They don't know what to say or do  I get teeth all the time by putting my hand with the cellar  I'll just be talking  And all of a sudden, I'll hit my hand on the back of his neck  Just gently, but not moving  And he'll look at him  Get off!  Sometimes it takes a minute for them to realize that there's another man's hand on the back of their neck  These guys were freaking out  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas? 
[02:38:00]  Hey  I learned that Lady Di has the IQ of a potato and the hairdo of a Davian Goliath claymation cartoon  That's good  That is good  Love you, Norma  Love you, thank you  Don't do it!

Yeah  Oh, you're repeating that  Wow, that's good  I'm sorry  I'll give her that  Lauren, I've talked to you before  Oh, have you seen pictures of his mule?  No, that would be interesting, though  He sends them  Oh, does he now?  Yeah  How old are you?  24  Forget it  Forget it?  Yeah, too old  I'm sorry  Alright  For Jim  Alright, so the votes 
[02:39:00]  We're up to 1,700 votes  328 say she should stay  Almost 1,400 say she has to go  What about the percent?  Is it going up or down?  80% go  19% stay  Okay, so the vote is  She's gaining  The vote is turning a little bit  Your pals Opie and Anthony  Think she should stay around  For a little while  She's gaining  Wait by the minute  I bet you that's how  E equals MC squared was created  They were weighing her  In a doctor's office  Probably would have been funnier  When she was on the phone 
[02:39:30]  Instead of 40 minutes later  Johnny come lately  Maybe I could improv  About something that happened  Last week  Cleverly come out  With it as 5'7  Angelo  I have no ad  Yeah, let's see if we can go late  Ruin the next show's intro  You hear me?  Yeah, go ahead  Go ahead, Anthony  Alright, pay attention  And Opie will get you  Into the interesting room  Yes  Norton is exomorphic  And Lady Di wants to make  Lemonade out of her 1984 Pontiac  I'm punching out, guys  Good job  We're outie  Yeah, look at that
