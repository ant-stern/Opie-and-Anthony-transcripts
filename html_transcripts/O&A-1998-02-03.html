<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a segment featuring Canadian guest, Jeff, who claimed to be the inventor of a board game called "Rumors."  Jeff's arrival was immediately noteworthy due to his possession of a soiled lime green piece of lingerie, which he initially tried to auction off for charity.  This sparked a sexually charged and vulgar conversation between Jeff and the hosts, focusing on the lingerie's smell, size, and alleged origin from a morning encounter with a woman.  Jeff also produced a small, plastic wind-up sex toy, which he operated on air, further escalating the show's already risqué tone.  The discussion frequently digressed, incorporating irrelevant tangents about various celebrities – Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky, O.J. Simpson, Oprah, and the Kennedy family –  Jeff's "fuzzy Kermit the Frog green" shirt, and his Canadian nationality, which became a recurring source of jokes.  The hosts repeatedly challenged Jeff's claims about inventing "Rumors."  Listener calls flooded in, with many urging Jeff's removal from the show.  To remain on the air, Jeff was challenged to put on the soiled lingerie, a condition he ultimately met. The segment concluded with Jeff promoting his game before leaving the studio, accompanied by further vulgar jokes and commentary from Opie and Anthony.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks, Black Lab, and wash it away.  It's Opie, it's Anthony.  I don't know how we're going to get through this without this guy cursing.  Every other word out of it.  Yeah, come on, we can ease, we're so cold, you know, I mean, we've got a thought somehow, guys.  Yeah, if you curse, those 400-pound bouncers will be in here to kick your ass back on the curb.  Yeah.  To the phone booth, you go.  Can I say Boston?  Boston.  What's your last name, Jeff?  Emer, sir.  Yeah, it's a good Polish name. 
[00:00:30]  And you're from Canada?  I am from the home of Bobby Clark, Flin Flon, Manitoba, sir.  All right.  And he is the inventor of the number one selling board game in America.  Absolutely.  You know, it's number two of the bullet, though.  You know, I'm not taking number one status yet, but Trivial Pursuit, look out, boys, because we are coming after you.  The game is called, you know, I'm only about 80 million behind, but, you know, I'm picking up steam.  You're picking up steam, okay.  The game is called Rumors.  You've probably seen it in your favorite mall. 
[00:01:00]  And Jeff is here to promote the game a little bit, but I'm a bit confused.  Yeah, well, get in line, buddy.  I'm from Canada.  Well, why don't you first explain what you brought us here.  Oh, I have for your female listeners.  I had the good fortune of having knowledge, kind of knowledge with a beautiful woman this morning, and she said, you may take my lingerie if it does opening Anthony's some good.  You may auction this on air.  You may do it every other money, but maybe give it to charity.  Now, it is a lovely, lovely piece of, I believe it's Victoria's Secret. 
[00:01:30]  I'm not sure it's the, it has a kind of a green hue to it.  And I'll tell you, it still has the gentle aroma.  Ah, it's soiled?  No, come on, come on, man.  No, no, that is not soiled.  That is just pure love.  That is pure love on there, boys.  So, you know, let the bidding begin.  Anthony is handling me.  I hear an opening bit of fire.  It's all for the cause, guys.  It's all for the cause.  Handling it with a piece of paper.  Yeah.  I think when you pick up a hairball. 
[00:02:00]  Well, Jeff, hold this up, because I want to see what it looks like.  It's a lime green lingerie.  All right.  It is one piece.  I believe it.  It's like a slip.  And I'm going to take such serious heat for this gentleman, but it is like, I believe, a 34E, gentleman.  Look at that mess.  Man, I'll tell you, it was a lovely morning, and man, am I going to take some heat for this.  Oh, that looks like something.  Yeah, come on.  Come on, Jerry.  I'm going to talk trash.  Hey, hey, hey.  You're talking to my girl, boys.  You know, you're talking about the most beautiful woman in the world.  Yeah, sure.  And where is she from? 
[00:02:30]  I planted her, I think.  Oh, planted her.  Okay.  Just outside.  Is that what smells in the studio?  It's the lingerie, right?  Hey, stop that.  Now, that's you, boys.  That smell was in here before I got in here.  No, you know, I didn't bring that smell with me.  What do you want to talk about?  Come on.  You know, let the bidding begin on that thing.  We're moving on.  Actually, there's some sick listeners out there that will put a bid on the soil blastery that you brought in.  We're starting at $100.  I am not letting that go for less than $100.  I've got to replace it. 
[00:03:00]  You didn't invent this game to pay for a Coke bill, did you?  Jesus.  You didn't pay your dealer off it.  It's the real thing, buddy.  Come on, come on.  I just, you know, I got to Boston, man.  It's, like, way warmer here.  I'm just thawing out.  Well, first of all, I'm just thawing out, buddy.  Actually, I met these two incredible women on the plane.  Yeah.  Well, first of all, who dressed you this morning?  This live green, what kind of shirt is that?  It's Kermit the Frog Green.  It's a fuzzy, I'm a fuzzy Kermit the Frog. 
[00:03:30]  It's a fuzzy Kermit the Frog Green.  He's got a bright orange shirt under it and a cowboy hat.  You fit in in Boston.  Yeah, me and Billy Buckner, man.  Oh, ouch.  All right, Brian, hit the phone and see if there's any bids on the soil lingerie to begin with.  And if you guys are real nice, we've got some more stuff for you.  We Canadians are very generous because you're up there just kicking the crap out of us.  So we might as well give you anything right now.  We'll just give it all to you now because you're going to take it eventually.  And where did you find this, then, a little party favor? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, well, you know, you'd have to describe exactly what's going on there.  But, you know, that was shades of what was going on this morning.  It was, well, no, actually, that was, you know, I was never that good.  I was never that good.  But, man, you know, I was taking pointers from that guy.  Explain this.  It's some plastic wind-up thing where a guy is in the process of having sex with a woman.  And look at the look on her face.  Come on, look at the look on her face.  Now, is that not the look of I've got to rush and buy a box of rumors?  All right, wait, wait. 
[00:04:30]  I want to play the sound on the air.  This is the guy going at it with the girl in this little sex toy.  Here it is.  Wait, wait, wait.  You've got to hold him just right.  You've got to hold him just right.  If you don't hold him just right, he gets all tender and upset.  Oh, there he goes.  There he goes.  Look at him.  He's rocking now.  I'm exhausted.  Give me a cigarette, man.  He's got a cigarette.  I think you need some pot to mellow out, dude.  Well, you boys should be crushing Prozac in that coffee out there, man. 
[00:05:00]  All right.  All right.  I cannot believe you actually invented a game, but we'll go with that concept.  Does it actually work or is it just one of those games that, like, no one even gets?  I've got way too much free time on my hands.  Does it work?  It works indeed.  Now, I'm going to give you guys the rundown on this thing.  Here's the Reader's Digest.  This game was launched in Los Angeles at September 22nd with a cast of Friends.  We're all hanging out, spreading rumors out there, and in a couple weeks, it's hitting the world at the New York Toy Fair.  Here's how it works. 
[00:05:30]  You hang out with your friends, and you spread rumors about each other.  Now, when a rumor gets spread, like Opie, rumor has it you indeed have had sex in the last 24 hours.  The rest of the group decides what is true of you, so you will put an answer face down.  That answer will be either true or false.  And everyone else is going to put their answer down, and it's either going to be true or false, attempting to match your answer.  Right, right, right.  All right.  So, you know, just for fun, Opie, did you get any in the last 24 hours?  I will say that he hasn't.  Anthony knows me too well.  There you go. 
[00:06:00]  Well, you are getting married, so you must be slowing down.  Well, I'm not getting married soon.  No, I'm not.  Do not start that rumor.  All right.  So, in the world of playing radio rumors, we're going to invite a few people in the studio with us,  and we'll bring Mr. Bill Clinton along, because he's going to have some fun answering a few rumors,  and Hillary and Monica Lewinsky, and maybe we'll bring in O.J. and Oprah, and who else we got?  You're wacky.  We got, you know, Michael Kennedy would be rocking on this. 
[00:06:30]  We don't have enough trees in the studio for him.  God bless his stupid little stupid soul.  What a dickwad.  Can I say dickwad?  Yeah, you can say dickwad.  You can abuse the Kennedys on this show.  Do we have a tranquilizer dark?  You mean like a guy from Wild Kingdom to come in and tag this guy.  Does any Kennedy die a natural death?  It is just not possible.  They're shooting their brains out or getting hit by a tree.  No, come on, you know, I'm just stating the facts, man. 
[00:07:00]  The truth is pretty powerful.  So who lets you in the building?  You do.  You guys, I was happy across the street.  I was running in the quarters, but I was happy across the street, man.  You guys rocked me.  Brian, did we get any bids on the soiled lingerie that he brought in?  No.  None of our listeners are that effed up, huh?  All right, I can play this game.  Wait a second.  I think Theresa Hines, isn't that Kennedy's wife?  She'd probably like it.  Come on, Ted, call in, buddy.  Hey, Colin said you'd love it, pal.  All right, Anthony, I got a rumor. 
[00:07:30]  Rumor has it that no one is listening to our show anymore.  I got nobody left in Boston.  I have to say that's true.  I love all you guys from Boston.  You know, come on, I was out goodwill hunting just a few minutes ago.  I bagged one.  All right, we're going to play some Hendricks.  My head's spinning.  We're going to play some Hendricks.  We're going to let Jeff run around the building about a thousand times, and hopefully that'll calm him down.  Give me a double express, and I'm just getting going, boy. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, my God.  And we'll be back with...  Like a 10-year-old on yodels and jolts.  We'll see if the listeners want to keep you in the studio or not.  How's that sound?  It's up to the listeners.  Come on, you guys got more power than that.  It's up to the listeners.  Give us a call.  Do you want this lunatic to stay on our show today?  9-3-1-1-A-F.  My wounds on the only station that really rocks.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  It's Brian.  It's Jay from Framingham.  And it's Jeff, the creator of this board game called Rumors. 
[00:08:30]  Rumor has it, I don't think he created this game.  Now, wait a second.  I'm throwing myself on the mercy of the Boston court.  I'm going to give you guys Roger Clemens back.  You know, there you go.  You can have him back.  That's one thing.  And I'm voting for goodwill hunting for the Oscars this year.  I'll do anything.  Anything.  You know, what else do you want?  I got more bags of drinks.  I want you back, guys.  He's Canadian.  You can tell he's Canadian.  So it's cool to hate this guy. 
[00:09:00]  Trust me.  It is very cool to hate this guy.  And he is from Toronto.  He did take Roger Clemens away from us.  This is the first guy on the show to plug a product that steers the conversation away from  the product whenever you mention it.  He hasn't plugged one.  I'll swing back around at some point.  All right.  It's basically like a card game.  And you start Rumors with your buds while you're sitting around a table, right, Ann?  Or something like that.  Yeah.  You think I was able to get game information out of this guy?  Yeah.  I'll tell you.  Well, here's kind of how it works. 
[00:09:30]  For the third time, here's how it works.  Here's how it works.  Come on.  Let's see if we can figure it out this time.  All right.  Let's, for fun, say Bill Clinton is playing with us.  Okay.  I should say, rumor has it, Bill thinks sex with a stranger, although dangerous is far  more exciting.  Okay.  Now, we would have to...  Now, Bill.  Bill.  Bill goes first.  Bill goes first.  Bill puts his card down.  He's going to see the true or false, but we don't know if that's true or false.  Correct?  And then we have to try to match what he did.  All of us are going to put our answer cards face down.  We're going to see how well we know Bill. 
[00:10:00]  You know?  And Bill will flip his over, and then we'll flip ours over, and we'll see how well we know  him.  And he'll score points if we mismatch, and we'll score points if we match him.  I would definitely say.  Yes.  There we go.  There we go.  Absolutely.  All right.  I want to play.  I got a question.  Okay.  Rumor has it, Jeff did a lot of blow before he entered the AF Studios.  Okay.  Put your card down, Jeff.  My card is down.  Okay.  I will have to say true, Anthony.  Mine is a true card, yes. 
[00:10:30]  Okay.  And Jeff, what is the answer?  The answer is absolutely false.  Oh.  It sort of sounds like it doesn't again.  And what happens when you lie?  In the game?  Well, there is a rule.  There is a rule for that if somebody can prove that I have a lie.  Did anyone check this guy's credentials?  He could be a homeless guy that picked up the game.  He goes around and says he invented it.  Just look at what I'm wearing.  If I don't look homeless to you, boys.  That's a great scam.  I never thought of that.  You could go into a store, buy a game, and then book yourself on radio shows and say  you invented it. 
[00:11:00]  Who's going to question it?  And by the way, we didn't get one single bid for the soiled lingerie that you brought  in because you did some chick in Toronto last night that had huge boobs and this freaking  thing smells.  It stinks.  And none of our listeners are going to bid for that.  All right.  Rumor has it.  I'm taking it off the table.  Jeff, where's that?  No, no, no, no.  I'm not going to eat this clothes.  No, no, no, no.  I say if Jeff wants to stay on our show, he has to put that on.  That was Marv Albert.  I'll put it on. 
[00:11:30]  I'll absolutely put it on.  We'll go to the break.  I'm coming back with women's lingerie.  That's one of the rumors, by the way.  Rumor has it.  You've worn your partner's underwear.  All right.  Could you explain this game?  That's all we want to know.  You got 60 seconds from right now to explain the game.  Go.  Okay.  Here's how it works.  Somebody takes a role as rumor monger.  They are holding 375 rumors.  They will turn to Opie and say, Opie, pick a category.  He can pick either fact, belief, or hot. 
[00:12:00]  Facts are things that have or have not happened to you.  Beliefs are your life opinions on life topics, and hot is a hotter version than the previous  two.  Now, Opie, you will pick a category.  Let's, for fun, say you picked hot.  Now, I have three rumors cards.  Okay.  Now, you will pick hot.  Now, I'm going to say, okay, Opie, here we go.  Well, rumor has it, Opie has once made love to more than one person in a 24-hour period.  Now, Opie, you get to answer that. 
[00:12:30]  That's either true or false.  You put that answer face down in front of you.  And then all of us, they're going to try to match your answer.  49, 50, 51.  Hey, Jeff, I bet you they gave you the ball a lot when they played Smear the Queer and  grabbed a score.  Here, Jeff, it's your turn to run with the ball again.  I was going to tell you, up in Canada, it was frozen, buddy.  Did they have short buses up in Canada?  Short yellow buses.  Have you ever been hit with a frozen tennis ball? 
[00:13:00]  I'm telling you, it makes a man out of you.  You know, I don't know.  We've got to go to the phones and see if the listeners want you to stay on our show today.  931-1AF.  AF.  The guy's cracking me up.  You've got to keep him.  All right, bro.  AF.  Dropkick that son of a bitch off the window.  Seriously, dropkick the motherfucker off the window.  AF.  Ah, let him stay.  Let him stay?  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, it's 3-1.  AF, who's this?  This is Linda.  Hi, Linda, what's up?  Boy, I think you should get this widow off the air.  Oh, no.  It's not looking good for Jeff.  I'm sorry, I can't vote to him today.  Are you married?  Yes, I am.  Okay, I'll be right over.  Okay, go back to Canada, you can't.  Hey, quit trying to make fun of us.  We do better ourselves.  Come on, is your husband home?  He should be home.  All right, well, I'll re-read him. 
[00:14:00]  I'll be there in 15 minutes, darling.  Okey-doke.  All right, honey.  Bye-bye.  AF.  Get that freak of nature off the air.  Where did you find him?  Come on, they picked me up off the street.  Where's your Boston hospitality?  You're all done, honey.  Go home.  I'll be right back.  Go home.  I'll be right there.  Wow, it's looking grim.  Yeah, well, the guys are digging it, but I'm screwed now. 
[00:14:30]  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Wow.  It's not looking good for you, Jeff.  Wow.  I think we can do, like, another break with you if you put the lingerie on.  I've been in tougher spots in this one.  Rumor.  You know what Jeff told me during the last break?  He also invented Monopoly and the cotton gin.  I had thrown Scrabble in the light bulb, buddy.  I got them all.  The VCR. 
[00:15:00]  Man, you sure are winning over the people of Boston.  Well, you know, I'm thrown in, Roger, but I'm taking the lingerie off the table.  Forget it, man.  Well, no one wants your soil lingerie.  Yeah.  I can appreciate that.  You know, it's ought to be a nice thing to do.  Oh, look at these.  A little bit of Canadiana.  Look at these faxes coming in.  Screw Iraq.  Let's bomb Canada.  Jesus.  I'll tell you anything to take the attention of Monica.  Come on.  You guys do anything to take the attention of her.  Jeez.  Can you sit still for one minute, please? 
[00:15:30]  He's doing the pee-pee dance in his chair.  I've got a Dr. Seuss rhyme, if you want to hear it.  Oh, we heard this one.  We'll go ahead.  No, if you heard it.  All right, go ahead.  Green eggs and ham?  Yeah, go ahead.  All right, here we go.  I'm here to ask, and you'll soon see, did you grope Miss Levinsky?  Did you grope her in your house?  Did you grope her beneath her blouse?  I do not do that here or there. 
[00:16:00]  I do not do that anywhere.  I did not do that here or far.  I did not do that.  Star you are.  Did you smile?  Did you grope her beneath her skirt?  And did you tell the girl to lie when called upon to take the fire?  I do not like you, Star you are.  I think you have gone way too far.  Could you shoot me?  Could you shoot me in the head, Opie?  I turned his mic off, and he's still going.  You can probably hear him in the background.  His mic is off.  All right, Jeff, here's the deal. 
[00:16:30]  If you want to be on the radio with us for another break, you will have to put on that green lingerie.  If not, Jeff will not be here the next time we talk.  All right, here we go.  He's still talking.  His mic's off.  Are you going to put the lingerie on for the next break?  Yes, I am.  All right, and if you have an opinion about this, you know, strange guy, yeah, give us a call if you want to abuse Canada.  I think he did.  Just buy the game and came in. 
[00:17:00]  I want to see your name on this.  Is your name anywhere on this game?  Check out the bottom line.  The company, Screamer.  Screamer.  I don't care, company.  I got a business card to prove it.  Is your name anywhere on this game?  I got a business card to prove it.  My name is kind of buried in the word Screamer.  I think you're full of crap.  I am completely full of crap, you know?  The love of God.  You're going to get a call.  Hey, wait a minute.  I invented that. 
[00:17:30]  I'm not sure this lingerie is going to go on, boys, but I'm going to give it a shot.  All right, well, we'll go to the phones next.  The only way Jeff will stay with us is if he puts on the green lingerie.  In the meantime, it's Stabbing Westward on AF.  Jeff, the only station that really rocks, it's Opie, it's Anthony, and I think it's  a homeless guy named Jeff.  Jeff is here because he has put on the lingerie.  Jeff has put the lingerie.  Get your fag lime green coat.  Take that off.  I'm in full regalia now.  I'm in complete full regalia. 
[00:18:00]  Smelling like a moose.  Dude.  Smelling like a moose.  You know, I was true to my word.  I said I'd do it, and here I am.  It doesn't fit all that well, but I feel all foofy.  Do all Canadians come with the fur coat?  Dude, what's up with that?  You got that right, buddy.  Dude, we told you to take off all your sweaters before you put the lingerie on.  Wow.  Me and Robin Williams, man, we're sporting a jacket here.  It's our money.  I think Robin Williams looks like a baby's behind. 
[00:18:30]  Wow.  I think he's got a poodle on his chest.  You're like Dr. Zayas.  Now, now, now, now, now, wait a second.  Here's a rumor for the audience.  One of the rumors there.  Rumor has it.  No.  Oh.  No.  Rumor has it.  Rumor has it.  Chewie, take us to light speed.  Chewie.  Use the force.  Use the force.  No, no.  Use the electric chamber.  What are you talking about?  Use the force.  Nice.  Use a Remington.  Nice God, dude.  Do some abs. 
[00:19:00]  Hey, stop it.  Come on.  You stripped down.  You stripped down.  Come on.  You know, you smart guy with a shirt on over there.  Smart guy.  I ain't taking my shirt off.  Now, I wish the listeners could see this.  We got Jeff, who supposedly invented this game called Rumors.  Although his name isn't on it.  It's a rumor.  It's a rumor that I had anything to do with it.  But he's such a pain in the ass that the only way we would allow him to stay is if he  put the soiled lingerie on that he brought in to the studio from last night's encounter.  It was this morning's encounter.  So now he's wearing the lingerie with his big, hairy belly. 
[00:19:30]  Jesus.  Anything for the cause.  I'm waiting for, like, guys with white coats and nets to come and go, yes, you invented this game.  Yes, Rumors, yes.  There's a funny farm where life is beautiful all the time.  Take them away.  I'll be happy.  They're coming to take them away.  Wow.  All right.  Well.  Well, well, well, well, well.  Now, now, now, now, now, now, Pamela, Pamela and Tommy Lee, are they here today?  No, they're not here today.  They were, they were spected in, weren't they? 
[00:20:00]  Uh, yeah.  Because I got a rumor for them.  I got a rumor for them.  Rumor has it.  I had a rumor here somewhere.  Rumor has it.  It's an actual rumor in the game.  Okay.  Rumor has it, Pamela and Tommy Lee have been videotaped nude as an adult.  Anyone heard anything about that?  Does that remind you of that first girlfriend you had, Opie, that had the mane running down  her back?  I love when Opie tells that story.  His first girlfriend was a Wookiee. 
[00:20:30]  Opie.  Are they hiring you for the next Star Wars movie as a Wookiee or what?  Hey, Jay, what does this guy look like?  Chubak?  Chubak?  I just turned his mic off.  Chubak?  Yes, he is a Wookiee.  Turn my mic back on.  Turn my mic back on.  I ain't turning the mic on for a sec.  Jay, what does he look like?  Wait, wait, go ahead.  Now I get your mic back.  An actual person?  Yeah.  He looks like Ringo Starr and Vicky Rourke had a baby together. 
[00:21:00]  I'm thinking Chubak meets RuPaul.  That's my, you know.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  I think it's Daniel Baldwin.  It's any one of the Baldwin brothers.  Wait, we're going to the phones to see if the listeners want you to stay or not.  AF.  Hello?  Yeah.  Get this hermaphrodite off the frigging...  AF.  Hello, Opie and Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I got...  You take this guy, get him to put the stuff on, and then throw him back out in the street 
[00:21:30]  where he came from with his game.  Send him out there with the lingerie on.  All soiled and everything.  Send him out there to sell his game.  All right, brother.  AF, what do you got?  Hey, I'm going to keep this guy.  He sounds like he's having a mushroom flashback.  AF.  Hey, Rob.  Hey.  Just remind Jeff that there's a 7 o'clock bed check at the sanitarium, okay?  All right, bro.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Have a good day, Pat.  I think you missed your AA meeting today. 
[00:22:00]  Are we safe to assume that there, Jeff?  I'm on step number 13 at this point.  Have you ever had any kind of run-in with narcotics or anything?  You have to be a little more specific than that, officer.  Officer.  What are you talking about?  I've got to get back into Canada today, boys.  Oh, I see.  Okay, well.  Here, give him his game back.  Here you go.  He allegedly invented this game, Rumors. 
[00:22:30]  You can pick it up where?  At any real toy store.  You can buy any real toy store, and these are real toy stores.  Games People Play, The Game Keeper, FAO Schwartz, and Toys, et cetera.  You can go online and check it all out at www.decipher.com slash eastwing.  You can actually play Rumors online at worldwithoutborders.com, 10 p.m. Eastern Standard Time,  hosted from Los Angeles.  And if you want to give Decipher a call and yell at them, you can yell at them at 1-800-654-3939. 
[00:23:00]  And there you have it.  I am cooked, and I'm feeling all froofy with my lingerie, and I think I'm ready to go.  I'm off to, I'm sure, circle the globe in a hot air balloon.  Is that what you're doing next?  All right, give him his game, his lingerie.  All right.  If you want, you can call us from the street.  We feel safer that way.  Now, you know, I feel a lot safer that way, too, although it's a little chilly out there.  So, everyone, check out Rumors.  Thanks for listening to me, Boston.  You guys are great. 
[00:23:30]  I love you.  Well, then, I'm sure they'll return that love.  Yeah, absolutely.  Ow!  Ow!  He will be leaving from the front of the building, just in case anyone is wondering.  Yeah, and he's got blonde hair and wire-rimmed glasses, and you're wearing a check shirt.  No, he looks like Ringo Starr and Mickey Rourke, yes.  And he's got a lime green coat on, and he likes baseball bats to the head.  Here's Rage Against the Machine, the ghost of Tom Jones, on AAF. 
[00:24:00]  The rubbing alcohol.  That's fine.  All right.  Hit him over the alcohol.  Here you go, bro.  I invented the Ferris wheel.  You did?  No, I just figured I'd say that.  Oh, okay.  You give me a drink.  All right, well, can you leave the studio?  We're done with game inventors at this point.  All right.  All right.  Pop-o-matic.  All right, bye-bye.  Oh, what's your name, by the way, bro?  Shut the hell up.  All right.  Give me a drink.  All right, get him out of the studio. 
[00:24:30]  What the hell is going on around here this afternoon?  A bunch of game inventors coming in.  Yeah, if you weren't tuning in earlier, we had the inventor of the game Rumors.  I think that's a rumor.  I swear to this hour, I think he just bought the game.  Right.  And he goes around to radio stations and says he invented it.  It's a great scam.  It's a way to get on radio, right?  I guess so.  But I think it's a good game.  We really couldn't tell because he just, I don't know. 
[00:25:00]  It sounds like it could be fun playing with a bunch of people that you, you know.  No, we could have done, we could have saved a lot of time and just tell people next time  we're in the mall, you know, pick up the game Rumors and turn it over and see what it's  all about.  Just read the directions off the back of the box.  Yeah, he wasn't going to tell us.  No.  I couldn't understand.  He was talking too fast.  It was just fun abusing the guy.  Yeah.  The guy had the hairiest chest I've ever seen in my life.  It was like, it looked like he had a poodle on his stomach.  Right.  And then I go, nice, God. 
[00:25:30]  At one point, if you're just tuning in, we did have the inventor of Rumors in the studio.  The only way we would allow him to stay on our show was to put on the lingerie from the  chick he did last night.  For some reason, he decided to bring the lingerie into the show today.  She had huge boobs, I guess, and it was this lime green one-piece number, and we made the  guy put it on to stay in the studio.  So he takes his shirt off, and we go, when are you going to take off your sweater, too? 
[00:26:00]  Unbelievable.  Yeah, a lot of fun.  All right, now we've got to get going with our show.  Oh!  Yeah, we actually had stuff planned today.  Yeah, that went out the window.  All right, you want to qualify another person to win the White Ale Club Med Prize Pack?  Hey, you want to go to Jerks and Geco's Islands with Apapadakak?  And Sam Adams.  Mm-hmm.  Jim Cook's going to be down there drinking with us.  It's going to be a blast.  We're going to be down there for a week broadcasting live.  We're celebrating the fact that Sam Adams has this new brew, White Ale, and all this week  we're qualifying people, and then Friday we'll pick a winner from all the qualifiers, and 
[00:26:30]  you're going down there to the islands with me and Akak.  That sounds like fun.  And I think we're going to be doing it this next week and the following week.  This is like a three-week contest because it's a very big deal.  Yes, it is.  All right, and we just don't want any schmoes going down there with us.  We want someone that knows us, knows the show, knows the radio station, so we're doing  Opie and Anthony trivia for you to qualify.  You've got to be a little bit of a fan of the show.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  So you want me to give them a question?  Yeah, it's your turn to get the question out there. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  Occasionally, during the past couple of years, we've gotten these faxes from a gentleman.  You might remember one like this.  Sometimes I like to take a cheese grater to my butt.  And then sit in a bowl of Brut.  Or sometimes when I get a hangnail, I like to peel it back till I get a thin red stripe  all the way up to my elbow.  And my favorite.  The credit card one?  Yes, sometimes when I'm in the shower and the bar of soap gets real, real thin, I slide 
[00:27:30]  it through my ass crack like a credit card and go beep, beep.  Who came up with these genius little bits of thought?  Yeah, you've got to be a true, faithful listener because we haven't had him on the show in a  while.  Yeah.  All right.  If you know that answer, you qualify for the trip to the Island's Mon with Sam Adams,  Opie and Anthony, and WAF.  Very good.  CD went on sale today.  Pearl Jam from Yield.  Here's giving a fly on AF. 
[00:28:00]  AF!  Hey, buddy.  How you doing?  I'm down here in the lobby.  They won't let me out of here, pal.  It's a touching scene.  You wouldn't believe it.  I'm telling you, Mayor Menino's here.  He wants to give me the key to the city.  No, I don't think so.  I got the key.  I got Ray Flynn here.  He's got my endorsement, man.  I mean, Drew Bloodsour's here.  The nanny's here, man.  I'm in tears.  This is so incredible.  Boston has embraced me, guys.  Go back to Canada, you kidnock.  I'll go back, but you ain't not getting Roger Clemens back. 
[00:28:30]  Ain't no way you're not getting him back, boys.  Hey, dude, we love your game, by the way.  Thank you so much, guys.  No, no, no.  We have a crooked table in the lunch, the break room, and now the table's nice and straight.  That's as good as the best thing anyone's ever done with that thing, man.  You mix little plaster dust, I tell you, you can fix walls and all kinds of stuff with a rumors game.  Anthony, any final words? 
[00:29:00]  Was that Anthony or was that Monica?  You know, it's so hard to tell the difference.  You know, the weather sucks so bad in Canada, and now I know why you guys all grow your own sweaters on your body.  Later, dude.  You boys stay out of trouble, and I'll spread some rumors. </pre>
