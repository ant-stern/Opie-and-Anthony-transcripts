<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The June 26, 2014, Opie and Anthony Show featured a chaotic and hilarious mix of topics, anchored by in-studio guests Jim Norton, Jim Florentine, Noah Anthony, and Rich Voss, with Bill Burr joining via phone.  The show opened with a discussion about tonsillectomies, fueled by personal anecdotes, culminating in Florentine's famously shocking (and possibly untrue) claim of keeping his son's foreskin in the freezer.

The conversation then veered into a discussion about the demise of 80s and 90s hair metal bands in the wake of Nirvana's rise, with Florentine detailing his own experiences and the surprising continued success of acts like Ozzy Osbourne and Guns N' Roses.  This led to a tangential debate about the ubiquity of cheap band t-shirts and Florentine's extensive collection.  A caller questioned whether the genre's decline was due to quality or shifting trends, prompting a discussion about various bands like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, and Motley Crue.  Florentine shared how his change in image affected his dating life.

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to Florentine's recounting of embarrassing anecdotes from his early stand-up career and romantic misadventures, including bombing a set in front of his girlfriend's family and subsequent heartbreak, discovering infidelities in shocking ways, and selling valuable baseball cards to visit a girlfriend who turned out to be married.

The show then shifted to the World Cup, focusing on the upcoming Germany vs. US game.  This led to a discussion of soccer's rules, potential outcomes, and other ways to follow the sport post-World Cup, with a caller providing information on the New York Red Bulls.  The infamous Luis Suárez biting incident and potential repercussions were also discussed.

Bill Burr's phone call contributed his characteristically cynical take on soccer, citing excessive diving and lack of sportsmanship. He shared a story about an Arsenal game and mentioned a 30 for 30 documentary about a tragic incident at a Liverpool game.  The conversation looped back to Florentine's tattoos, specifically his high school mascot, leading to a digression on bizarre high school mascots.

Rich Voss joined the in-studio mayhem, sharing a bizarre story about a seemingly fraudulent comedy club booking in New Orleans, "Lucky's," that never opened, resulting in Voss losing money and a plane ticket, and a supposed suicide/disappearance of the owner.  A New Orleans caller confirmed the club's non-existence.  The ensuing discussion covered Voss’s upcoming projects (a possible TV show based on his podcast), his habit of falsely claiming to be an FBI profiler while golfing, and a news story about a family's ejection from a KFC.  This segment also incorporated humorous speculation and teasing about Voss's projects, fueled by listener call-ins.

Further segments focused on Florentine's intense aversion to shared ketchup, stemming from a childhood incident with a fly.  This evolved into a ridiculous discussion about the potential for contaminated condiments, including absurd speculation about disgruntled interns spiking ketchup with acid.  The conversation included a discussion on the etymology of "Indian giver," Voss’s nicotine gum use, pill regimen (including Viagra), car-buying habits, and promotional segments for the guests' upcoming appearances. A caller shared marital sex life challenges, sparking further off-color jokes and anecdotes.  A female intern was also briefly interviewed.  The show concluded with continued speculation surrounding Voss’s upcoming projects and the general chaotic energy that defined the entire broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh, good morning, everybody. Welcome aboard. June 26, 2014. In studio, we got Jim Norton  and Jim Florentine and Noah Anthony, who's, uh, what does he got? Do we know yet?  He's still got something with his tonsils.  I saw the picture on Twitter of his tonsils.  Yeah, that left one. I'm like, I called him. I'm like, do you still have your fucking tonsils?  Right.  He's like, yes. I got my tonsils. Do you really? Yeah, it's good to have your tonsils, right? 
[00:00:30]  What do they do? I don't know.  I feel like the appendix of the throat. Do they actually do anything?  Yours is out, right? Yeah.  Some kind of, um, sickness or something like that. I got mine out at like 23 or 24 really late. It was painful.  They say it's painful the older you are, so.  But I was getting strep throat and tonsillitis like once a month, so.  Same with me. Yeah.  But it all went away. I don't know. I still have my tonsils, though.  I think I got mine out. I had my adenoids out first when I was a kid, and then, um, I think my tonsils came after that. 
[00:01:00]  They just had to go.  I got everything out. The appendix. I'm just basically a shell.  There's nothing internal anymore.  I know. There's no little gym.  I wanted to keep my tonsils, too, I told the doctor.  I said, I want them in a jar.  And he's like, ah, that's a weird request. Okay.  And then when I was done, after the operation, I couldn't talk, and he wouldn't give them to me, because he knew I couldn't talk.  Right.  And he's just laughing at me. He's like, you're not getting them.  Why?  I don't know.  They're yours.  He said they had to do, like, a biopsy on them.  Oh, that's bullshit. I think that's how they get around giving you body parts. 
[00:01:30]  Right.  I mean, if they take one of your body parts out, you should be able to keep it, no?  Yeah.  I mean, I kept my son's foreskin. I still have that.  Do you really?  Yeah, it's in my freezer.  I don't know.  Why?  Why not?  I don't know.  He might need an extra inch when he's 17.  Might as well be his own.  You really have that?  Yeah.  How'd you bring it home?  In a little baggie?  Yeah, they gave me, no, they gave me in a little jar.  They labeled it, too.  How big was it?  It's just a little piece, like, yeah, like a fingernail, long fingernail. 
[00:02:00]  What does it look like?  It's just a piece of skin.  Why did you need to keep that?  I was just joking with the doctor.  Oh, okay.  My wife's brother was there, and I'm like, hey, can we keep the foreskin when he's doing it?  And he's like, what?  Yeah, my brother-in-law, he keeps them.  He sells them on eBay.  And the guy's like, uh, okay.  And he came back in.  I'm like, we're laughing.  I'm like, there's no way.  And he came back in.  And he goes, here it is.  And then a nurse comes in with a label.  She goes, I have to label that.  Where's that jar?  Like, you know, it's going to get mixed up.  Sure.  Or somebody else's foreskin.  That is really strange.  Yeah, they never know.  With foreskin, you never know, it could be a religious thing.  Like, people don't want to fuck with foreskin. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, they probably can't say no.  Yeah, but I said he was going to sell it on eBay.  It wasn't even a religious thing.  Right.  Well, there's certain religions that might actually have been that.  I was just talking with Florentine about his Nirvana shirt, which surprises me, you know,  as far as him being a metal guy.  Because Nirvana, you know, took out all the bands that you kind of, well, no, well, you  liked a lot of the bands that went away, right?  Yeah, I did.  Like, Guns N' Roses, like you were saying earlier, Motley Crue, Cinderella a little bit.  But, I mean, metalheads hate Nirvana, I think. 
[00:03:00]  It pushed them all off the radio.  Yeah, they got to get over that.  Really?  Yeah, because it was peaking at that point.  It was kind of, you know, everybody was fading.  All the bands were doing the same exact song.  Two, you know, pop hits and then one ballad.  It got really watered down.  Yeah, well, MTV ruined it, too.  But then MTV and radio were the ones that took the heavy metal away.  Right.  They stopped playing the videos and they stopped playing it.  I think radio started with Nirvana.  As soon as they started playing Nirvana, then MTV said, oh, we're not going to play that 
[00:03:30]  hairband stuff anymore.  We're going to go with grunge.  Yeah, it just pretty much came out of nowhere and just killed so many people's careers.  I mean, bands like Rat and, you know, were playing in front of 20,000 people.  They went from 20,000 to like 1,500 within six months.  Tops.  It was crazy.  Right.  That's got to be a hard fall for a lot of those bands.  Of course.  Yeah, but everyone just loses interest at once.  Yeah, they just, everybody just.  Overnight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We all remember where we were when that Nirvana song hit.  Because then Pearl Jam came right after that. 
[00:04:00]  Soundgarden was right there.  Alice in Chains was already started.  They had all the bands lined up and they're like, all right, if Nirvana hits, we're good.  And man, did they hit and everyone else came flying through the door.  Yeah.  That was a tough time for music.  It was a good time for music.  Because you're right.  You felt it in the air that something has to give.  This is getting ridiculous.  Because we've talked about it, even Ozzy went down that road.  Yeah.  For some reason, he survived.  He just made little adjustments.  Right.  Like that, I always, I love the Ultimate Sin videos where he had the poofed out, like the 
[00:04:30]  defrosted hair and no shoes.  Yeah.  One of those videos.  Yeah.  And then, but as the 90s kind of rolled in, he changed his look a little bit and his  hair was like straight and long again and he had like the darker glass.  Like for some reason, he just adjusted and survived.  He was able to survive.  Guns N' Roses for a while was able to survive, but not many others, really.  Yeah.  I mean, even others made comebacks after they went away for a bit, but, you know.  Even Ozzy, I remember Use Your Illusion 1 and 2, they came out the same day.  Remember, that was a huge thing. 
[00:05:00]  Absolutely.  At midnight, everybody's lined up for it.  No More Tears came out that same day.  Really?  Yeah.  And no one was, no one's even talking about Ozzy's record at all.  And that wound up being Ozzy's probably biggest record.  Sure.  No More Tears.  I didn't realize that was the same day.  Wow.  Came out the same day.  And I remember Ozzy was doing like a signing at Tower Records or somewhere.  Yeah.  And Guns N' Roses was doing something somewhere else.  Everybody was just interested in the Guns N' Roses.  What year is that?  92.  Yeah, that's about right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Because I remember he did No More Tours.  Like there was a shirt. 
[00:05:30]  No.  Yeah, I know.  That was in like 93.  Oh my God.  It was his last tour.  Right.  I guess maybe it was, maybe ticket sales were, maybe it was a time where ticket sales were  rough because they put on like, this is the last tour.  Yeah.  And I bought, I didn't know back then that bands just did that.  Right.  So I was like, fuck, he's never coming around again.  So we got to go see him.  I did.  20 years later, he's still touring.  Oh yeah, yeah.  This time.  No More Tours.  No More Tours.  No More Tours.  Yeah.  He didn't say that.  Just the shirts at No More Tours. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, No More Tours.  Yeah, the back of it, No More Tours.  Is that a $9 shirt, really?  Yeah, I got it at Target.  Nice.  Which one?  Just a Nirvana shirt.  Oh, really?  $9.  Target, Walmart, Kohl's.  I get my hats at Target.  Yeah.  I get excited to go to Target and see their latest hats.  And I don't go too crazy, but they got just basic hats.  I got a nice Guinness hat from Target once.  Yeah.  They do all right.  They got good stuff, yeah.  People make fun of you, but Target.  Guns N' Roses.  They got a Guns N' Roses shirt.  ACDC.  Right.  Hendrix, Raging Against the Machine. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, sure.  Why pay $40 at a concert?  I could pay $9.  Exactly.  Who all started selling concert shirts?  Macy's or one?  No, it was one of those stores.  Bloomingdale's.  Yeah, maybe.  They started selling high-end rock shirts.  Bloomingdale's in their rock section, you know, has, yeah.  Yeah, like Walmart did a thing with ACDC, their last record, Black Ice, and they had  all these ACDC shirts there.  They were all like $10.  Right.  Instead of $40 at a concert.  I said, I have 32 ACDC shirts now.  Wow.  And then whenever I go in like an Old Navy, they have a new one, and I have it in my  hand.  I'm like, why am I buying this? 
[00:07:00]  Do you really need that many ACDC shirts?  No.  No, I don't.  I don't know.  Isn't it an obsession?  I've worn maybe four of them.  I don't know why.  Why are you doing that?  I got 27 Sabbath shirts.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Man, I got like five or six concert shirts.  That's it.  I got a couple Rolling Stones.  I got three closet fulls.  I got a Pearl Jam.  I got like 550 of them.  I could use an ACDC shirt.  Go to Old Navy.  How about you just give me one?  There's a lot to be. 
[00:07:30]  You might need it.  I might have one in doubles.  Yeah, I think I have one in doubles.  He's collecting them.  Yeah.  I do have a few in doubles.  I would like an ACDC shirt.  That would be kind of cool.  Absolutely.  You know the Highway to Hell thing that we've done on the show?  What's your thought on that?  On what?  The line.  The beginning of the song.  Can we play that for him?  Because he's an expert at this shit.  Listen to the lyrics.  Living easy.  Living free.  Season ticket on a one-way ride. 
[00:08:00]  Living easy, living free.  Season ticket on a one-way ride.  No.  They say the N-word.  Oh, no.  Hear it again.  Hear it again now that I've said that.  Okay.  Living easy.  Living free.  Season ticket on a one-way ride.  You know.  Come on.  I can see where that's coming from.  Come on.  You do hear it, though, right?  It might be that little Aussie accent that Bon Scott had.  You know.  Yeah.  You hear it, though, now, right? 
[00:08:30]  He might have thrown a little, like, you know.  You hear it, right?  He might have thrown a little dig in there.  I don't know.  You hear it.  I saw your face.  You hear it.  You've never heard that before, have you?  But it makes sense.  Living easy, living free.  Season ticket on a one-way ride.  Yeah.  Just going the highway to hell.  The other way makes sense, too.  How would that be worded?  The N-word what?  She's a nigga on a one-way ride?  That would be a so weird song lyric.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He would write that, and people would be like, wait, what does that mean?  Angus would probably come in and go, what are you saying that for?  Yeah.  Doesn't make sense. 
[00:09:00]  Even back then, it was, like, a weird thing to say.  It's there, though.  You think?  I hear it loud and clear now.  See, I don't know.  Bond would write the lyrics, and Bond was a big blues guy, so he respected the blues.  That's where he started, as a blues singer.  So he wouldn't just say that word.  He probably wouldn't throw that word around.  Right.  All right.  That's there for your listening pleasure.  Do you ever go on eBay and look at the rock shirts?  Yeah.  Fuck, dude.  That's an obsession of mine. 
[00:09:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Honestly, I've said this before.  That's one of the reasons I lost weight is because I wanted to buy old concert shirts,  and I couldn't.  Mediums or back then, even larges, fit, like, little tiny people.  I like the original ones, where they're really soft and nice.  They're small.  I like a nice, soft T-shirt.  The softer, the better.  I've bought, like, bootleg shirts off of eBay.  Right.  And I wear them on that metal show, and bands get in touch with me, like,  where did you get that shirt?  Really?  They don't even, yeah, I feel bad wearing them.  I'm like, I don't know.  I just got off of eBay somewhere. 
[00:10:00]  Wow.  It's not even the original shirt.  Oh, they think it's been, because it's a blue leg?  Well, they've never even seen it before.  Like, we're in charge of merchandise.  We never saw that.  James in North Carolina.  Go ahead, James.  So, you guys were talking a few minutes ago about, you know,  Nirvana and the 90s music kind of killing hair metal.  Right.  I'm wondering, couldn't it have been that the hair metal fucking sucked a dick,  and people were just tired of Bon Jovi and Rat and Cinderella and shitty bands like that?  Well, I don't think they got sick of Bon Jovi. 
[00:10:30]  Bon Jovi's another band that survived the whole grunge movement.  They never went away and never, you know, dropped their numbers as far as who they played to.  But you're kind of...  They were a metal band.  They were a rock band.  They were a top four band.  If you were a rock band, you survived.  But if you got into that hair metal category, you were fucked.  And I think Florentine made a good point.  It just got watered down.  And, you know, we were all waiting for something new.  The time was right.  Well, by...  They were fed up with terrible, terrible music.  Yeah.  Well, hold on.  But did you like that music for a while?  God, no. 
[00:11:00]  I was a suicidal tendency.  Okay.  So you never liked it.  I was true metal, not hair crap.  But you can't argue the...  I mean, those bands were extremely popular and doing very well.  And then I really...  They had all the chicks.  The girls loved them.  So, of course, they had...  You know, you have the fans.  Yeah, but the point is, then it just all went away.  But they did have their success.  Very true, yes, sir.  I mean, you didn't like it, and that's fine.  But they were extremely popular.  Yeah, Bon Jovi was one... 
[00:11:30]  He was considered hard rock at that time.  He's not anymore, but...  Oh, God, no.  He was in that hard rock, hair metal category.  He actually survived it.  And Def Leppard, it took him a while to rebound.  They actually survived it.  They took a big hit, too.  Those were the two bands out of it.  Motley, because that's when Vince Neil left the band,  and they put out a record with another singer, John Karabi.  Right.  That went nowhere.  And then they got Vince back in the late 90s.  They put two records out that went nowhere.  Right.  They were still touring, doing like 2,500, 3,000 seats.  Now they're doing arenas again.  Wait, what was the other singer? 
[00:12:00]  I don't think I've ever heard of it.  John Karabi.  It was just called Motley Crue.  It was just self-titled.  Oh, wow.  They had a song called Hooligan's Holiday.  Oh, right.  I remember that song.  It was heavy.  It was a heavy record.  Yeah, right.  But Vince did a solo.  Vince put a couple of solo records out that didn't go anywhere.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right there, James.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  I appreciate it, man.  You rock.  Thanks.  But I got laid a lot with that music and that look.  I took that look and whatever David Coverdale or Bon Jovi looked like.  You were copying that? 
[00:12:30]  Absolutely.  And all those chicks lumped it.  Just to get the pussy?  Yeah.  Try being in fucking workout pants and going on the road with them.  It was fucking humiliating.  Really?  It was awful.  That was what my job was.  I drove and watched him fuck chicks.  It was so embarrassing.  From like, what, like 86 to 92, if you look at the back of my baseball card, it looks like  I fucked in the steroid era.  My numbers are way inflated.  Something was going on.  Something was going on there.  Nice.  And then you cut your hair and not so much?  Yeah, it was brutal.  Really? 
[00:13:00]  I took a major hit, too.  See, I didn't know you with the long hair.  I've heard the stories.  Yeah.  And I've seen the pictures.  And actually, my sister knew you with your long hair.  She did?  Well, because of the Fast Eddies.  You guys all performed there when she was working there.  Yeah.  And she knows you as Jim Florentine with the really long hair.  She hasn't seen you in years, obviously.  But yeah, I took a major hit with numbers, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I went from dating, like, you know, banging, like, strippers and hairdressers  to, you know, girls and girls on a bank wanted to go on dates.  I didn't go on a date for, like, six years. 
[00:13:30]  I'm like, for what?  You didn't have time for dates?  No, I just go, look.  For what?  Yeah, for what?  I'm like, God, we'll meet at the bar.  I got shit to do until, like, eight.  Yeah.  So you just meet them now.  I'm not taking you to dinner.  No.  For what?  For what?  I remember some chick said, you want to go to Sunday brunch?  I didn't even know what that was until, like, 1989.  I didn't.  I'm like, what is that?  You never heard of Sunday brunch?  Sunday brunch.  No.  Sounds awful.  I know.  Let's get a brunch.  Good for you, though.  But Jim was always good, though.  When you felt bad about a girl, he was the guy to call.  Yeah.  Like, there was one chick, really hot one that you were buying. 
[00:14:00]  She was probably a 10, but then she stopped fucking him.  And I was like, that would have killed me.  But he was so practical about it.  He's like, look, man, I never should have been there to begin with.  I'm like, what a great attitude.  Absolutely.  I get in there.  It was almost like fucking Pam Anderson one night.  Somehow.  I get in there, and then she never called me back.  I'm like, I don't care.  I get in there.  You were never heartbroken by a girl?  Yeah, I was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, there was a couple.  You know which chick?  I mean, that one, that girl.  Yeah, yeah.  But I mean, when you were just kind of, you know.  Yeah, there was this one chick I was in love with.  Yeah.  Yeah, she would just blow me off. 
[00:14:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's funny, because Voss is coming in, I guess, later, because that guy, they live  down, like, the Jersey Shore, and her parents wanted to come to see my show, and I was opening  for Voss at this place.  It's a sandpiper.  Remember that old, it was like an old strip club.  Wow.  Down, like, Seaside Heights or something like that.  I forget.  But it was just me and Voss on the show, and I just met Voss, who were kind of friendly.  He was still a dick.  Right.  Of course.  He's still a dick.  So her family, she's all excited.  Her family is going to come see me do stand-up.  I'm only doing stand-up, like, nine months, and I had to do 25 minutes up front.  Voss is the headliner.  And I bombed. 
[00:15:00]  I did the 25.  I stood up, because I wanted to get paid, and her family and their friends, their neighbors,  because I went to the barbecue.  There was, like, 20 of them there.  It all came.  On a scale of one to ten, it was probably a half I had on a scale of one to ten.  Not even a one.  Not even a one?  For 25 minutes.  What happened?  It was just a weird crowd?  I just stunk.  Wow.  Wait, did you talk to them that day at a barbecue?  Oh, yeah.  They were all excited.  Oh, yeah.  They couldn't wait.  Oh, my God. 
[00:15:30]  He's a comedian.  Yeah.  Let's all go.  They were all sitting in the front, and she was there?  She was there with her family?  Oh, yeah.  She came with her family.  No one laughed?  No.  Maybe I had a one.  Maybe.  Oh, my God.  So what happens?  Of course, as soon as Voss goes up there, his first joke doesn't hit.  He goes, hey, if you guys don't laugh, I'm going to bring that asshole back.  And the most crowd's like, no, no, no, no.  And then Voss went up there and murdered for an hour.  Really?  Murdered.  Were you embarrassed?  And I went in the bathroom, and I was in the stall, and I didn't know where to hide. 
[00:16:00]  The place was packed.  You were hiding.  I went in the stall, and I hear these guys go, man, that first guy fucking sucked.  And they don't know it's me in the stall.  They're like, oh, my God.  I'm not even a comic.  I can do better than that.  What the fuck?  Where are they getting these people from?  He was terrible.  Did he ever do it before?  They were going on and on for like 10 minutes, and I couldn't walk out of the stall.  I'm like, please, just get out of the bathroom.  You should have begged for forgiveness.  And then that chick didn't even bang me that night.  Never banged me again after that.  What did they say? 
[00:16:30]  I stayed over a house, too, and she's just like, maybe she should just sleep on the couch.  Oh, my God.  But what did they say after the show?  How awkward was that?  They're like, no, it was good.  They were just, you know, no, you did a great show.  And then there's always the one guy, they were tough.  Oh, no.  Not after what Voss did.  Voss could have fucking filmed an HBO special.  Right.  After what, so it had nothing to do with the room.  Nothing.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, that's awful.  And then what?  And then she never, she said, you know, maybe she should sleep on the couch tonight,  because I was going to sleep over a house.  I used to sleep in her bedroom with parents didn't care. 
[00:17:00]  And then that was it?  Yeah.  And then I was trying to hold on.  Nothing worse than trying to hold on.  I remember she liked this Don Henley CD, End of Innocence, or whatever it was.  Right.  And I'm like, oh, you can borrow it, because I just wanted to hold it.  So I just said she had something in mind, so I had to call her to get it back.  Oh, my God.  Yes, I gave her that.  And then one night she blew me off, and I pulled up in front of her house, and I slept in front  of her house waiting for her to come home.  Did you really?  In my car, yeah.  Oh.  None of us knew this back then. 
[00:17:30]  Oh.  I love that it happens to the best.  It's like finding out your husband's a serial killer.  Oh, no.  Clarentine was a rock star when it came to women, so it's nice to know that you've fucking  suffered like the rest of us.  Oh, yeah.  So you're in your car waiting for her to come home.  So I just wait outside her house.  Did you see you're coming home?  She said I'll be home at like 11 o'clock, come over.  Oh, okay.  And she never came home that night.  Oh.  So I woke up at like 7 in the morning.  I went to probably about like 4.  I'm just sitting there in my car.  And by 7 in the morning, I woke up, but she still wasn't home. 
[00:18:00]  How much does that hurt that she didn't come home?  And I just pulled away.  It hurt, right?  Yeah.  Was she attractive?  She was definitely banging somebody else.  Oh, yeah.  Phenomenal.  And you never saw her again?  No, I saw her again, but she wanted nothing to do.  What was her explanation for being out all night?  It was out with friends.  I'm like, oh, because you told me to come at like 11 o'clock, so I just waited for a  little while.  I said a little while in front of the house.  I didn't want to tell her I slept in my car in front of the house.  Nothing worse than hanging on.  And you know in your soul that it's over, but you just try to hang in there, hoping that 
[00:18:30]  things might miraculously turn around.  I thought maybe the CD would keep us together, and I went there because I had to go get it.  How much do you hate Don Henley?  I know.  That bastard.  Did you ever like Don Henley?  I did like that CD.  Really?  End of the Innocence?  What else?  Heart of the Matters was a good song.  Heart of the Matters on there in New York Minute, I think.  I don't know.  There was another time.  I had this girlfriend down in Florida, and six months in, I found out she was married.  Right.  She didn't tell me.  She said, you can't come over my house.  My parents are going to hate you because of your hair.  Right. 
[00:19:00]  They were religious.  So I'm like, I don't want to fucking meet your parents anyway.  Perfect.  I found out because she was still married.  And I told her, look, I need a day or two to think about this because I can't believe  you lied to me.  The next day, next night, I pull up in front of my house.  I got home from work early, and she was fucking my roommate.  What?  Yeah.  I walked in on it, and I just hear a moaning coming from my room.  What was that about?  She just said, oh, fuck you.  Oh, you don't want to.  Were you close with your roommate?  No, it was some guy in a band that I kind of knew.  It was a living down in Florida. 
[00:19:30]  Because we're just sharing space.  Yeah, she just came over.  I knew how she was.  She did that to me the first night I met her.  Wow.  And she just went in his room and started fucking him, and I walked in and heard him.  Oh.  So what'd you do?  Well, first, I was listening.  You gotta listen a little.  I think you gotta listen a little.  And she was fucking, she's never moaned like that before.  Really?  Yeah, that hurt.  That hurt.  I didn't, you know, that was like, damn, what the hell is he doing to her?  You need to know his technique.  And then she came out, she's like, oh, really?  You're gonna make me wait?  Fuck you, asshole.  Wow.  I'm breaking up with you and just walk right by me. 
[00:20:00]  Wow.  How long did you listen for?  A couple, I didn't know what to do.  I'm like, do I knock down the door?  Like, I wasn't gonna beat the roommate up, because I knew how she was.  Right.  And he was just some dumb guy in a band.  Mm-hmm.  So she just went in his room and just hopped on top of him and started fucking him.  Jesus.  He's like, dude, I'm sorry, man.  I'm sorry he wouldn't come out of his room.  I'm like, don't worry about it, man.  It's all right.  Did you guys stay roommates after that?  Yeah, yeah.  I moved back to New Jersey after that.  That one fucking hurt.  I'm like, I just ate a shit sandwich.  Time to go. 
[00:20:30]  How long had you dated this young lady?  I was just like six months.  I was in love with her, too.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know you were with her.  I sold them my baseball cards, and I brought them up to New Jersey to meet my family.  Wait, you sold baseball cards to bring her up to New Jersey?  Yeah, for a plane ticket.  How old were you?  How much did you get?  20, 21.  But how much did you get for your baseball cards?  They were worth like 6,000 bucks, maybe like 800 bucks.  Oh, wow.  I had some good Mickey Mantle.  Did you really?  You had some of the old ones?  Yeah, Willie Mays, yeah. 
[00:21:00]  Those are the ones that are worth finding and collecting, not the new baseball cards.  Oh, no.  It's not like you sold a Frank Thomas.  Who would care?  I was a desperate man.  Any baseball card you have in the last 25 years easily is worth nothing.  Yeah, nobody cares anymore.  Before that, 80s, 70s, 60s.  If I had that Hannes Wagner 1910 card, I would have fucking sold it.  Oh, boy.  First class for everybody.  Yeah.  You sold your baseball cards to Flyer.  Oh, my God.  I love this idea. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, I know.  I'm like, this is the girl.  I'm going to marry.  Because we've heard all the great stories where you're just the rock star.  These stories are way better.  I know, of course.  Did you ever see her again?  Yeah, I saw her.  Yeah, after that.  And she wound up fucking all my friends down in Florida right after that.  Really?  Yeah.  They would call me up like, look, she wants to fuck me.  I'm like, go for it.  So, where did you sell the baseball cards?  Just went to a collectible?  Yeah, some collectible store down in Florida.  Store?  Yeah.  I knew the guy was ripping me off.  But you were just in love. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, I was so excited.  I'm like, I've got plane tickets.  Did you have enough money?  I wonder what she told her husband where she was going for a few days.  Right.  Wow.  Oh, right.  She was married.  But the husband must have known that she was not good.  I don't know.  She was a bad egg.  Do you see what she looks like now?  That's the beauty of Facebook is these girls you don't see for 15 years.  You can take a look at her now.  Oh, I searched out some of the ones that did me wrong.  I never did.  And I'm very pleased every time when I see their picture and what they become. 
[00:22:30]  Well, I remember seeing her about a year and a half later and she put on like 30.  So I was happy about that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  She was trying to come on to me.  She was dating one of my friends at that point.  And she was trying to come on to me and I'm going to get out of here.  Wow.  Did you have enough money to like take her out to dinner after the baseball card thing?  Or it was just enough money to get the plane ticket?  Probably just the plane ticket.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Were you sad that you didn't have your baseball cards anymore? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, afterwards.  More than I do.  But that made me turn into a scumbag.  Like after that, that turned me.  Yeah, that turned me.  You know, because I thought I had morals back then.  Like I can't believe I'm sleeping with a married woman.  I don't know if I could do this.  Right.  I'm going to burn in hell.  Right.  And then she did you wrong.  So then you're like, fuck this for a while.  Yeah.  What year was that?  Because I met you in like 90.  No, this was like 86.  Oh, okay.  86.  So then you went on a tear after that, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My friend Dave told me to shave my bad mustache and grow my hair long. 
[00:23:30]  You had a bad mustache?  That was brutal.  Dude, have you ever seen this?  Yes.  I look like Adam, right.  It was in my one-man show.  That picture.  It looked like.  Can I see this?  Is it online somewhere?  No, I don't.  No.  It's not a good look.  I had a mustache too for a while.  I had the mustache.  Well, we grew mustaches so we can get our beer because you looked old.  Right.  So when we graduated high school, we grew mustaches so we can look like.  Somewhere around when I was 18, 19, mustaches.  No.  I'm going to date myself, but mustaches were actually in for a while. 
[00:24:00]  Ah.  And everyone grew one.  And I had a mullet.  I'll find my mustache picture.  First, it was short with a mustache.  It was a bad, it was like a bad cop mustache.  Right.  It was awful.  And then I grew up, then I had like a mullet with the mustache.  Right.  It was terrible.  So many people had that.  So many guys had that look.  And I used to brush my hair.  You never had a mustache?  Well, you're a little.  No.  You're not that much younger than us.  Mustaches don't look good on me.  I think you just missed the mustache stage.  Plus, I had a baby face.  A mustache would have looked idiotic. 
[00:24:30]  It was mid-80s-ish.  Mustaches were in for a while, man.  And we were all young with mustaches.  Absolutely.  I don't remember.  But we only did it because we looked older.  Yeah.  So we didn't have to show ID.  My friend Bill D'Angelo looked older.  Bill looked like he was 35 when he was 16.  So he was the guy that would just get us liquor.  Like, I personally, there's nothing I could have done to make myself look older.  Wow.  All right.  We've got to find the mustache picture.  I'll find mine, too. 
[00:25:00]  And you're, uh...  When you tape, Jim's tape, a comedy special, a stand-up special,  is that your one-man show or your actual stand-up?  No, regular stand-up special, yeah.  One-hour comedy special at the George Street Playhouse,  New Brunswick, New Jersey, on September 13th.  Tickets go on sale for one hour.  When are they going on sale?  Oh, July 9th.  Oh, okay, okay.  They're going on sale July 9th.  All right, I got this now.  Sorry about that.  July 9th, tickets go on sale for one-hour comedy special at the George Street Playhouse.  And September 13th is when you're taping it.  Yeah, September 13th, I'm taping it.  And Michelle, that did your specials, is doing mine. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, she's great.  Yeah, she's done Louis stuff, Kevin Hart, Michelle Caputo.  She's excellent.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she's really good.  She just did Jim Jeffries.  No, we know her.  Yeah.  Yeah, she did a great job with Jimmy's special.  You're in good hands, sir.  Yeah, she's very nice, and she's honest.  Some of you don't trust people.  Some people are just dishonest when they're overseeing those projects, and she's honest.  There's a lot of dishonest people.  So there'll be links and all that stuff I'll let people know.  But July 9th, tickets go on sale for it.  Yeah, cool.  Yeah, it'll be sold out for sure.  Where are you at with soccer?  We got a big game today.  What time is the game? 
[00:26:00]  Noon.  I don't know.  It is noon.  Noon, yeah.  Fuck!  I'm coming around to it, watching it.  Yeah.  You know what I love about it?  There's no commercials.  Right.  It's constant action, and the clock just keeps running, even when the ball goes out of bounds,  whatever it is.  But then they add time onto the clock.  Yeah, it's a weird thing.  It's really strange.  I don't know how much time is left in the game half the time, because they'll put up  a plus two or a plus five.  I don't understand it.  When Portugal scored the other day, I'm like, all right, we got a few minutes left. 
[00:26:30]  I didn't know there was basically no time left, because I couldn't figure out the clock.  Yeah, it is weird how they just automatically put time on.  But I do like the constant action.  Not that it's like, you know, in an NFL football game, they've done a thing where in a three-hour  game, there's only 11 minutes of action.  So you can't say that soccer, you know, I just love how it just keeps playing.  There's no interruption of goofy commercials.  Constantly, every three minutes, you go to another two-minute break of commercials, come  back, another two minutes.  Is there timeouts? 
[00:27:00]  I don't even know.  I don't think so.  There's no timeouts in soccer, either, right?  No, and it's, you know, a short halftime, and they're back on the field, and they just  play.  Yeah, I don't know if I'll follow soccer after the World Cup, but I'm definitely checking  out games now.  Right, because they're watching the All-Stars play, basically.  Right.  So this is like the playoff, so you're going to see the best teams, the best players.  Well, the problem with soccer in America, then after the World Cup, what do we do?  What soccer league do we follow?  For American teams.  Do you even know?  No, I have no idea. 
[00:27:30]  I know there's a team in Newark.  Yeah, but they're...  I didn't know that.  He had a Red Bulls or some shit.  Yeah, but do we follow them now?  I have no idea.  There's a soccer field next to my house.  I know they got great, great, you know, leagues over in Europe and stuff.  So what, you grab one of those teams and just, like, adopt them?  The Premier League, is that, like, one of the big leagues?  Is Manchester United a league in the Premier League?  Are they different leagues?  I don't know.  Like, what do I do after the World Cup's over is my question. 
[00:28:00]  Who do I follow?  Do I just pick a team out of Europe and then go with this?  Well, America has a league, but nobody really follows it.  Eric, that's my point.  I mean, I know we have a league, but do people care about it?  No.  That's what I'm saying.  Do I follow my hometown team?  What are they?  Who are they?  What's their name?  I don't even...  Hold on, let me see.  Does New York have a team?  New York has the Red Bulls.  Who's the Cosmos?  They're playing Newark, yeah.  Who's the Cosmos?  I don't know. 
[00:28:30]  Weren't they a soccer team?  For a while.  They used to be.  That was the team that Pele played on.  That's a long time ago, though.  Wait.  I don't think the Cosmos are still around, are they?  The United States team?  The New York Cosmos.  Oh, they were the New York Cosmos.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  I'm not that much of a deal.  Yeah, that's a long time ago, though, right?  Say, we don't know.  I know.  I'm lost in this one.  I like this exercise.  Even with computers.  We don't know shit.  But with computers, this is how bad we're doing.  The Cosmos still play?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I will be watching today. 
[00:29:00]  I didn't know it was at noon.  You don't hear a lot of news about this.  I have a couple things to do, so I've got to get my shit done.  I love it.  The game's like an hour and a half long, and it's over.  It's not drawn out three hours, and it's just constant playing.  I kind of like that, too.  90 minutes and done.  90 minutes and done.  The clock keeps running.  No goofy insurance commercials.  Papa John fucking commercials.  You don't like flow?  But why add time onto the game when you can just stop the clock and make it a nice, solid 90 minutes? 
[00:29:30]  That's what I don't understand.  Well, they do it for injuries.  I know.  I know, but when someone's injured, just stop the clock.  They don't want to.  They just want to keep playing.  They should adopt some of the things we do over here.  I'm sick of the bad acting, though, with the injuries.  Oh, yeah.  They fall down like they got shot, and then two seconds later, they're running down the field again.  What about the bite?  Everyone's talking about the bite.  His third time doing that.  Yeah, he's a problem.  Yeah.  He even admitted that he's a problem, and that he's trying to calm his shit down.  He said that, I think, a mere week before he did the bite.  Shouldn't you get thrown out if you bite people three times? 
[00:30:00]  The first time, you're almost ready to get thrown out, and the second time.  You would think.  But three times, he's bitten people.  He has big teeth, too, man.  I got some fucking chompers.  Yeah, he's fucked.  I think they're going to ban him for life or something.  Really?  Yeah.  Did you actually hear that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I read it somewhere.  It might be in the paper today.  I don't know.  Let's say hi to Jose on Long Island.  Jose. 
[00:30:30]  Hey, how are you?  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, I heard you guys talking about what you can do after the World Cup.  The Red Bulls are in Harrison, New Jersey.  Pretty easy to get to, and the tickets are pretty cheap because they're trying to attract fans.  Right.  So you can get midfield seats down in the bottom for like $25, $30.  But do they play the other countries?  Don't the other countries play each other?  Like someone from Italy will play London and they play Africa?  Yeah, that's what makes it so exciting.  I mean, you know, every country has a team. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  And then, well, then we go back to watching it in America where every city has a team.  That seems a little strange.  I don't know.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  They do have friendlies with like the Premier League teams and the teams from Spain, so  they invite them over here because it's such a big market.  Right.  Yeah, they get like Liverpool.  They get Manchester United played here.  And they have international friendlies all year round, too.  I don't even have friendly. 
[00:31:30]  International friendlies.  Oof.  I do like a good fribble, though, every once in a while.  I used to love fribbles.  That sounds awful and international friendly.  Yeah, it doesn't mean anything.  Let's have an international friendly.  Yuck.  So that means the game means nothing.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah, but the only reason I watch the World Cup is because every game means something.  It's amazing.  You know, there's a lot on the line.  Right.  You're right.  Honestly, I'm a casual soccer fan, but when it's the World Cup, I'm all in. 
[00:32:00]  I've been watching it at work.  It's crazy.  I love it.  They shouldn't just have one big, giant international league.  Why not?  Don't they already or no?  And how these guys play once a week, and I don't know.  I don't know.  I think they might, you know, eventually they might do that.  It seems like it's starting to catch on in America.  People are getting more disgusted with, you know, hockey's getting big again.  Right.  The ratings used to be shit.  Right.  Hockey's starting.  You know, because it's a physical sport. 
[00:32:30]  Not a lot of commercials, too.  The playoff hockey is phenomenal.  And the HDTV is really helping out.  Absolutely.  You can follow the puck a lot better than, you know, when we were growing up.  Yeah.  It was just a blur on the ice because of our shitty TVs.  You can see where sports are going.  For me, at least, just with my kids.  They'll watch hockey.  They'll watch soccer.  They can't stand watching a full baseball game.  It's too boring for them.  I hate baseball.  I finally had to, like, be honest with myself.  I kept saying I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a Mets fan. 
[00:33:00]  And then some listener called me out, like, you're not a baseball fan.  And I think they said, name, like, three players on the Mets.  And I couldn't do it.  I'm like, oh, that's right.  I haven't watched a game in, like, a decade.  I hate baseball.  But you know what was on the other day?  I watched it.  It was the Yankees Classics, and they showed the 98.  Right.  The first game of the Padres World Series when the Yankees were down,  and they scored, like, seven runs in the eighth inning.  Like, Knobloch hit a three-run home run, and then Tino came up and hit a grand slam.  And Michael Kay and Sterling were doing the calls, and Michael Kay called. 
[00:33:30]  It was one of the greatest home run calls I've ever heard.  And Sterling was not the guy calling it.  It was so nice to hear a home run call by somebody else.  That fucking idiot.  Well, I remember Jim Lairitz hit that homer in the Braves series when they were down 2-0.  The Braves came in, and it was 98, I think.  Or 96, yeah.  Braves came in, beat the Yankees two times in Yankee Stadium, killed them.  Yep.  And they went to Atlanta for three, and Lairitz hit that homer.  They were down or something like that.  They were down 6-0, I think. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, something like that.  Right.  Yeah, and I remember that.  You like baseball?  Yeah, I'm a San Francisco Giant fan.  I watched a game.  Lincekin pitched a no-hitter yesterday.  Yesterday?  Yeah, yesterday pitched.  It was on during the day.  See, that's exciting as all hell.  Yeah.  But games like in late June are not exciting in general.  There's nothing really on the line.  I watched the first three innings, and then I tuned back in about the seventh inning,  and I heard because he was pitching a no-hitter.  I'm like, I'll just...  Because a baseball game, you could just tune in later.  It doesn't have a sixth inning on.  And then watch from a seventh inning on.  Is that the first no-hitter for the year? 
[00:34:30]  No.  Kershaw pitched one, too.  Yeah, there's been a few.  There's been a few already?  Three or four, yeah.  Is it still special to throw a no-hitter?  Yeah, absolutely.  It seems like it happens more.  Yeah, because it's more of a pitching league now.  The guys aren't on steroids as much anymore.  They have to hide it.  Right.  So that's why, you know, amphetamines they can't take, so these guys are tired.  Right.  You're not allowed to take that, so maybe they're drinking Red Bulls or some shit or coffee,  but they're not doing the same trick as it was before.  Aren't the pitchers tired, too?  Yeah, but the pitchers got an advantage over the hitters.  I'm a huge fan of the steroid error. 
[00:35:00]  Absolutely.  I don't know them personally.  I don't care what they're doing to their bodies.  They're still doing them.  A bunch of the guys are still doing them.  They just haven't got caught.  I'm sure they'll figure out new ways, right?  All right, Jose, thank you.  Thank you, boy.  Let's go to Toronto.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, listen.  I know what you guys can do to enjoy soccer going forward.  There's the Champions League.  What's the Champions League? 
[00:35:30]  The Champions League is the European League.  So basically it's all these guys here at the World Cup.  The biggest teams are in Europe.  So you get to see the champions of each country going off against each other.  So you have Real Madrid and Manchester United and AC Milan and all the top dogs where all  these guys play.  And it's this soccer 2.0.  Like it's that much better than the World Cup.  Do you think it's better than the World Cup?  Oh, totally.  In terms of quality of the game and excitement and draws for the fans, it's fantastic. 
[00:36:00]  But the problem is, you know, the Americans aren't represented in the Champions League.  Yeah, I know.  And you know what?  That's the thing that gets to me.  I think Brazil is turning the corner for the Americans because it seems like you guys are  really, really getting it into it this time around.  Right.  Which is nice because you're the last big market, I think, that they really need to capture.  It depends on today's game, too.  Like if the U.S. just looks stupid.  Can we get knocked out today or no?  I guess the...  We have a really...  We have an extremely good chance of moving on today. 
[00:36:30]  You know what?  A lot has to happen for us not to move on, I hear.  Well, you know what?  I think the likelihood of you guys not moving on today is pretty slim because you've got  the Germans in the U.S. that all they need is a draw.  Right.  And they knock out two of the biggest teams.  Right.  So, I mean, strategically, it would make a lot of sense for those two countries just  to draw to knock out two of the bigger teams, Ghana and Portugal, which would make their  life easier if they ever had to play against each other.  You've got the German coach, Lowe, and the American coach, Klinsman. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  We're like best buddies.  Yeah, they're really close.  So, if there's a battle and she can, they just said, we can all walk out together.  I actually heard all this today.  There's a really good chance it'll just be a draw because it's in everyone's best interest.  That's crazy.  Wouldn't you want to win just to win, though?  Absolutely.  You know what?  But I think I just got to say, like, I mean, we're Canadian.  We haven't made it to the World Cup since 86.  But it's really nice to see the Americans actually, like, grasping this and having a lot of fun  with it for now.  Like, for O&A to be talking about soccer, which you guys couldn't care less about. 
[00:37:30]  Well, it's the World Cup, though.  I think we were talking about it four years ago as well.  I'm a soccer guy from way back, and I played in high school.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, that's great.  Because, I mean, it's fun.  And I think the U.S.  But I think the U.S. is cheating because every time they interview one of our players, he  has a very heavy accent.  And a lot of these guys have dual citizenship.  It's like, oh, boy, I think we're cheating a little bit at this point.  But the one thing about the American athletes that always amazes me is they may not be the 
[00:38:00]  best, you know, soccer players on the field, but they're always the best conditioned athletes.  Like, they don't get tired.  It's an American thing.  They really know how to produce some serious athletes, right?  So it's just about time that they've caught the soccer fever.  So it's great.  But New York is a hotbed for soccer.  They've got tons of fans from all over the world representing this.  You guys must be having a blast.  Yeah, I went to a couple of Cosmos matches recently, and I saw the Red Bullers.  It was nice.  I don't know. 
[00:38:30]  You cheering on Pelé there, Jimmy?  Yeah.  I think I'll probably check out some international soccer after this a little bit.  I'll take a peek.  But I don't think I'll be going to a game in Newark or any of that shit or wherever they  play.  I don't think...  Well, I mean, you know what?  If you guys ever got him, put it on your bucket list to go, like, to Europe and watch  one of those games.  I don't want a bucket list.  No, it's not on my bucket list.  You know what I do?  Yeah, mine's banging my wife's friend.  That's my bucket list.  Not a soccer game.  Well, that one I would agree with you, but...  Yeah, anyone who has a bucket list, I don't want to talk to. 
[00:39:00]  Know what it's called?  Just live your life.  You know what?  Would you sit down and actually make out a list?  Oh, my God.  I want to go watch a game in mid-season.  Let me add it to my bucket list.  Yuck.  Oh, my God.  Real men don't make bucket lists.  I think Florentine agrees with me on this one.  When you make a bucket list, I have to one day see the grand candy.  Yeah.  I'll try to do Florentine's voice.  You guys can hammer me on that one. 
[00:39:30]  Jimmy, when are you coming back to Toronto?  I'm not sure yet.  No, no.  You're not getting out of this.  Tell us what's on your bucket list.  Sorry, what?  Tell me three things on your bucket list I need to know.  Three things on my bucket list?  All right.  God.  I don't even have one.  I shouldn't have thrown that out there.  I'm getting hammered for it, man.  All right.  Thanks, Joe.  All right.  Take care, guys.  All right.  To answer your question, I think Jimmy's going to be doing a lot of things in Montreal. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, I just got stuff at the festival, but no Toronto.  So go east.  Well, I mean, Toronto's not that far away.  Last year, a lot of people came from Toronto to see us.  All right.  We should take our first break.  Oh, so the soccer game's on at noon today against Germany.  Man, that last game was such a fucking bummer.  That game was unbelievable.  I don't even know anybody's name on the team.  I know Tim Clark.  Tim Howard.  I mean, Tim Howard.  See, and I said Tim Clark.  Tim Howard, of course.  That's all.  And now I'm just mad.  Another thing to be frustrated by after that game. 
[00:40:30]  I'm like, why am I into soccer?  How did I all of a sudden care?  Now I've got to be frustrated.  I didn't care for my whole life, and then all of a sudden one headbutt,  and I want to throw myself out the window.  I didn't care four hours prior to the game.  And then I'm all frustrated like everybody else.  I'm like, how did this happen?  Yeah.  And then they said it's a world-class ball.  What's a world-class ball?  I guess that's an assist in soccer.  I'm guessing.  And I think it's how he kicked it.  It was a world-class ball.  That was unbelievable, the way he kicked that to that guy and friggin' headbutted it in. 
[00:41:00]  Amazing.  An amazing fucking play.  I love the way we talk about none of us use the right terms.  No, we have no idea.  I love the way he kicked that to that guy and friggin' headbutted it in.  We don't even know who that guy is.  I used to always have a joke about soccer.  I go, look, don't let your kids play soccer.  I go, if they're kicking balls when they're younger, they're going to be licking balls when they're older.  That was always my philosophy on it.  But I'm starting to come around.  Did you use that in front of the barbecue crew?  No, that was later.  That's too bad.  No, that actually would have worked. 
[00:41:30]  That would have turned everybody around.  Yeah.  Do you remember any of your jokes were at that point in front of that group?  Like at that first?  Yeah, because I remember I said I went into a bar and I didn't know it was a gay bar.  And the guy came up to me.  He's like, are you a switch hitter?  I go, yeah, I'm a switch hitter.  I'm going to hit you with a right.  Then I'm going to switch hands and knock you out with a left.  Yeah, I do remember that.  I'd forgotten it until that moment. 
[00:42:00]  I can't remember.  I think I said I should have known it was a gay bar.  It was called Bendover's Tavern.  Oh, yes.  I feel like a kid in therapy who just realized something really tragic.  All right, let's say hi to Greg in Montreal.  Greg.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, good morning, buddy.  Stomach hurts.  I just want to elaborate on something you said earlier about the Lifetime ban.  The max ban for FIFA is actually 24 games. 
[00:42:30]  And the most they've ever dished out has been eight.  So it's unlikely he's going to get a Lifetime ban from that shit.  So why the fuck was I reading Lifetime ban?  I heard two years was the most they can give him.  Yeah, exactly.  That add up to about 24 games.  How many games are a season?  Oh, let's see.  They do four first.  Let's do some math.  I don't know, man.  I just was under the impression.  24 games maximum.  But is that a full season? 
[00:43:00]  It sounds like he's saying it's like two seasons by the time he's done.  With his, yeah, okay.  Two full tourneys.  I don't know anything.  And look, he got suspended from the EPL last year.  He actually stopped a goal with his hand intentionally.  He just stuck his arm out and got in front of the ball.  So, I mean, this guy's been problematic for a pretty long time.  Yeah, this guy really is.  Although he's not my team, I'd love him biting people and fucking grabbing the ball with his hand.  Look, everybody's talking about soccer now between the World Cup and this guy biting.  So it's great for soccer. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, he's doing the sport well.  But why is it problematic if one day you say, you know what, I've had it.  I want to use my hands this time.  If everyone did it, what are they going to do?  Throw you all off the field?  Everyone should just use their hands.  And what, that's a major penalty if you use your hand like that?  Yeah, man.  He got suspended.  He's just childish.  Do they give the team the goal if he used his hand to stop it?  No, they're going to get a penalty kick.  So why wouldn't you use your hand every time when you know it's pretty much a guaranteed goal?  Do they suspend you?  Ask the guy who's going to call up after me and tell me I'm full of shit. 
[00:44:00]  No, because that's almost like it.  But if you're in a desperate situation, why wouldn't you realize your goalie's out of position  and why wouldn't you use your hand and just take the chance with the penalty kick?  They're definitely going to fine him some, like, exorbitant amount of money.  I mean, he got in deep shit.  So they really didn't frown upon you using your hands, obviously.  Oh, fuck yeah.  It's like in football, you know, when someone's wide open on a bomb, a guy's going to trip him.  Right.  Because he knows he's going to catch a receiver.  It's going to be a first and goal, but at least it's not a touchdown.  At least they have a shot. 
[00:44:30]  Hockey does the same thing, yeah.  Right.  So.  Yeah.  Are you guys coming up to Montreal for just for laughs again this year?  I'm going to see Jimmy, but are you guys going to make it?  Yeah, I believe we're going to broadcast a couple shows up there again.  We had so much fun last year.  Fucking right you did, man.  All right, I'll check you then.  All right, thank you, buddy.  Greg in Montreal.  All right, so Jim Florentine's in today.  We've got Rich Voss coming in in a little while.  And let's not forget, July 9th, Jim Florentine's doing a one-hour comedy special at the George Street Playhouse,  New Brunswick, New Jersey, on...  Oh, no, it's...  See, this is written wrong. 
[00:45:00]  I apologize again.  Well, I wrote it on sale July 9th.  Yeah, they go on sale July 9th.  Tickets go on sale.  I'm rewriting this.  Tickets go on sale July 9th for your one-hour comedy special at the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, New Jersey,  and that will be taped on September 13th.  Yes.  Okay.  So I'll be in Nashville July 14th at Zaney's.  Nice.  Yeah, I saw you tweet that.  So are tickets going well for that?  I think so.  It's a Monday night.  Right.  So I don't know how it's going to be, but I'm in town doing...  I'm opening for a band on Sunday and then...  You're still opening for bands? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  We open for...  Is that going better?  Yeah.  You've had some horror shows with that.  I got the system.  This band, Fall Out Boy.  Yeah, we know Fall Out Boy.  Yeah, I'm doing a few dates with them.  So what, you go up and do just 15, 20 minutes?  I do like three, five-minute sets in between the bands.  Wow.  That's rough.  But you got it figured out finally?  Yeah.  Because I work for Jager Meiser, so I make announcements.  That's like two minutes.  That eats up two minutes at a clock.  And then I got three minutes, so I just pound them. 
[00:46:00]  But this isn't my audience.  Fall Out Boy crowd doesn't know me.  It's a little different.  If it's a Megadeth show, it's easy.  I know exactly what works with them.  So I haven't done it yet.  That'll be my first gig, so we'll see.  Have you gotten booed at all?  Yeah.  People throw shit at me, yeah.  Like a punch in the head at the merchandise table.  That's why I'm asking how it's going, because you've told these stories on our show.  Yeah, well...  It sounds like a horrible gig.  Yeah, this one could be bad, because they're going to be...  And when you know it's going to be a bad crowd, do you stretch out the Jager Meister announcements? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, I'll just cut it short.  I'm like, I didn't do five?  The guy's like, you got off early.  Oh, really?  I thought on my clock I went on...  Oh.  Yeah, I got it all down.  You just played dumb.  I had to go out and announce to Megadeth that they were canceling the show, because the  lightning and stuff, the power went out.  Right.  I had like 8,000 people booing me.  Oh, fuck.  I had to go out with a megaphone.  They're all taking it out on you.  Yeah, they're all taking it out on me.  I mean, they had to call like 20 cops in before I made the announcement that there was going  to be a riot.  And you had announced that the show's done.  Yeah, well, I wanted to. 
[00:47:00]  Someone's like, we need someone to go out there.  I'll do it, because I have my friend taping me.  I'm like, get this on tape.  Oh, nice.  I got it on tape.  Yeah.  And I'm making them on.  I got a...  I don't know if I...  Oh, you got to pop that up somewhere.  And I'm making them on.  I go, what do you want me to do?  I go, if there's a guy here that can fix the pole over there, I'm just frigging just...  And they're just booing me.  Wow.  And I got a big grin on my face.  Wow, really?  That's great.  You rule.  Bill Burr, everyone.  What's up, Bill?  Nothing.  I said, I'm holding joy in that story. 
[00:47:30]  I would have killed to have seen that grin on your face.  Oh, I couldn't wipe it off.  I couldn't wipe it off.  All those soaking wet long hair standing there?  Yeah.  I don't know why we like abuse so much.  Like, no one would do that.  And you couldn't wait to volunteer.  I volunteer.  I'll do it.  And they go, we got to call 20 cops to stand behind me on the stage in case they rush the  stage.  Right.  Because they were really nervous that they were just going to go crazy.  And what happened?  They just looked...  Yeah, everyone just kind of walked out.  No, I mean, what happened?  Just a major power... 
[00:48:00]  The power went out.  Yeah, lightning hit a pole.  Was that Oklahoma?  Yeah, it was in Oklahoma.  Yeah, I missed that video.  Wait, lightning hit a pole.  So wouldn't the crowd understand...  No, they wanted to...  They don't understand lightning and what that could do?  No, they wanted to see Megadeth, and that was it.  And that was it, no matter what.  So that's like when you're sitting on an airplane and there's terrible, like, weather.  And then they go...  They start announcing how there's going to be delays.  And people on the plane are, like, upset.  Like, the pilot should go for it.  Right.  Right, yes.  And also, that venue is connected to a zoo, and you're not allowed to curse, and I didn't  know that, so I'm up there fucking saying fuck. 
[00:48:30]  And I got off the stage, and the guy, the promoter, is like, what's your name?  And I'm like, why?  He's like, that's $3,000 every time you said the fuck, and you said it four times.  And he's like, what's your name?  And I just...  I go, Artie Fletcher.  He's a comic friend of mine.  And he wrote it down.  He's like, you're getting fined.  Seriously.  I love the thing.  What if you don't pay it?  Like, you can never go to the zoo?  Don't they curse at the zoo, though?  They were going to take it out of Megadeth's money.  Right. 
[00:49:00]  At the top, they take it right there.  They make you pay it right there.  They take it right off the top.  And Megadeth camp's like, didn't you know to curse?  I'm like, I didn't know if we couldn't curse.  Do they understand what they do to the elephants, and you're not allowed to curse?  It upsets the animals if you curse, and then there's people at the zoo.  Right.  Too funny.  Yeah, that and making a bear ride a bicycle.  Hey, Bill, we just attempted to talk about the World Cup and soccer in general.  Can you please fill in the blanks?  We suck.  First of all, are you watching it?  No.  Oh, you're not?  Every other American, I'm not watching it. 
[00:49:30]  And I'm not buying this stock footage they're showing of people in Kansas City standing outside  watching a soccer game.  There's no way.  Just walk into all the empty bars that are showing it.  I swear to God, there's no way there's a bunch of barbecue-eating rednecks in Kansas City.  I got sucked.  A thousand people outside freaking out to Cameroon or whoever the place is.  Just score a goal on Turks and Caicos.  I got sucked into one of those montage videos. 
[00:50:00]  I'm like, oh, look, everyone's very excited.  I got sucked in.  Oh, the highlights are great.  I mean, I'm going to try to watch.  It's always funny to play Germany.  You know what I mean?  There's always something great about if you can actually beat them.  Because even though Hitler's long gone, you know they still think they're superior.  It's still fun to see if you can actually beat them.  And now we've got a German coach.  But, like, I mean, I don't know if the dive-in's a little bit less this year.  But that's the thing that stops me from enjoying it is the – I mean, look, people flop in the NBA. 
[00:50:30]  People dive in the NHL.  But they don't roll around the ground like they're going to start crying.  Right.  That's what I – they just take it to a whole other level.  But I think it really hurts to get kicked in the shin.  Yeah, but they're back up in two seconds.  We've all taken a hit with our coffee tables to the shin.  It's not pretty.  It fucking hurts.  Yeah, I know.  But you watch, like, the UFC, and they, like, use that part of their leg to smash some guy.  I mean, at some point, it's like you are a professional athlete. 
[00:51:00]  You're not a radio host.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And they have a shin guard there.  Right.  You know what?  I can see if somebody steps on it.  Dude, what about the guy that bites the guy in the back, and then he flops.  And, actually, he hurt his teeth when he bit into the guy.  It's, like, it's really, like – look, every league has got, like, the floppers, and they have the divers,  and they have the dirty guys and the piece-of-crap guys.  But, like, with soccer, there's just – the level of sportsmanship when it comes to that, it's just like – 
[00:51:30]  it's just like being a pussy and a liar is, like, part of the strategy of the game.  That's what I can't get past.  Other than that, I like the game.  A lot of elements of hockey are in it.  I went to an Arsenal game when I was over in England, and I had a great time.  But, like, I just can't get past that – the chicory, I guess is the word.  They just act so goddamn effeminate sometimes, rolling around in the grass. 
[00:52:00]  Well, that's to turn on the women in the stand.  Yeah, and you really shouldn't be having hair gel in when you're playing sports.  They have hair gel.  Yeah, absolutely.  The Ronaldo guy, he fucking looks like he just came out of a club in Miami.  Come on.  And they said that Z was for a cancer kit, but that's not true, I hear.  Right.  That that was a false –  Is it true or not?  Because then I saw a bunch of places where they're saying it is true.  I don't know.  Hey, Bill, you didn't see U.S. Portugal the other day, though, with that last-second goal?  No, the game's come on. 
[00:52:30]  I think I watched – I taped that, and I started watching it.  It was – it was cool.  Look, the only reason why I want us to win – I want us to win the World Cup  and then come back here and have, like, the whole world hates us  and then only 40 people show up to the parade.  I would love that.  That would be great.  If we actually went on a run and we won it, like, five times in a row,  which would eat up, like, 20 years, and everybody just going, like,  they don't even care.  They don't even care. 
[00:53:00]  Why are they into this?  That would really make me enjoy it.  And anywhere else it would be, like, a million people would show up.  Oh, that's funny.  Dude, they literally – I mean, they start crying, like, I swear to God,  like some, I don't know, religious thing going on.  I mean, it's – like, the people in the crowd.  Dude, when I went to that Arsenal game, right, Arsenal was playing –  I think it was Everton, and Everton, I guess, sunk.  Like, and Arsenal went up 1-0, which is, like, going up, like, you know,  28-0 in football, I guess, right? 
[00:53:30]  So, it gets to the end of the game, and it looks like Arsenal's going to win,  and all of a sudden, Everton scored this goal to tie it up.  Dude, there was a guy two rows in front of me.  Like, I thought he was having – I thought he was having, like,  an epileptic, like, seizure or something.  I'd never seen anybody – dude, this is a regular season game.  This guy lost his fucking shit to the point, like, I was uncomfortable.  Like, staring at him, like, is this guy going to do something?  Is he going to, like, leap off the – whoever the hell we were in, like,  the upper deck? 
[00:54:00]  Like, I don't know.  Yeah.  The left of how seriously they take it.  It always makes me feel dumb.  It's just like, wow, I just –  Well, don't forget –  You know, I get that same feeling, like, when I go to a museum,  and everybody's looking at, like, paintings and stuff,  and they're, like, losing their minds, and I can't wait to get out of there.  It always makes me feel like an idiot.  Yeah, they have incredible passion for their sport.  I mean, we had that with, like, you know, playoff football, playoff hockey, right?  But –  Yeah, I mean, some people – look, you even look at this country. 
[00:54:30]  I mean, people in this country are basically either, like, football and basketball  or football and hockey at this point.  I mean, even, like, baseball.  I mean, hockey's always been, like, the odd man out.  Even, like, with four sports, it's too much over here.  So, with the way the UFC has blown up, I mean, and actually is starting to mess with, you know,  some of the four major sports, I would think.  I don't think we have time for soccer, even if we wanted to.  That guy, first of all, guy might have had money on the game.  You don't know why he lost.  He might have went crazy because he might have lost a shitload of money. 
[00:55:00]  That's a good point.  Dude, he acted like an absolute schazz, man.  Like, I was looking at him like, if he ever did that in high school,  you're just immediately just to get the shit kicked out of you.  Just for being that excited.  Just for being that excited.  He was just a super fan.  Although, you're saying that the passion in general was pretty crazy for a regular game.  No, it was great.  You know, they were over there, like, you know, singing all the songs and everything.  I actually talked to them about some of the hooligan shit.  Right.  That used to go on after that. 
[00:55:30]  One of the things guys would do, they'd come up with, like, a box cutter, right?  Super, super sharp.  And they'd come up behind, like, a supporter for the other team.  Like, they're standing in a crowd, and it would slice right across, horizontally, right across your ass.  And they were so sharp, they'd do it so quick, the person wouldn't realize it until you left.  So then they'd have to stitch your butt cheeks horizontally.  And you basically, you couldn't sit down and take a shit for, like, three weeks.  What the fuck?  Really?  Because you'd tear up the stitches. 
[00:56:00]  Wait, and this happened more than once?  That sounds like something that should only happen once.  Well, that's the funny thing, is the sport looks so damn effeminate, but I wouldn't fuck with anybody who watches it.  Oh, hell no.  No, you're absolutely right.  Yeah, somebody told somebody, like, I did this thing, I cut across the ass cheeks, and he won't be able to sit or shit.  Like, the word had to spread that that was a good way to hurt your opponent's fans.  Oh, yeah, no.  Did you guys see that 30 for 30 where they showed that, was it that Liverpool game? 
[00:56:30]  When they went in and they all, they packed them in too tightly and, like, 80 people, like, standing up died.  They were crushed in so tightly that they literally, like, suffocated, like, standing up.  I had to shut it off.  It was one of the most brutal things I've ever seen.  There was, like, just people up against the fence going, open the fucking gate.  Wow.  And those stupid cops were sitting there with their dumb hats and their whistles. 
[00:57:00]  I was staring at them.  How long ago was this?  This was, like, I think the late 80s.  Dude, I'm not even joking.  Wow.  All jokes aside, like, you've got to get yourself into a certain mindset if you're going to sit and watch it, dude.  It was the most horrific thing I've ever seen.  You know, in English, they, you know, they're not into therapy and that type of shit, so nobody, everybody on the thing wanted to cry.  Right.  But everyone was, like, holding it in and shit.  You know what?  I've got to check that out.  Fucking, no, you really, I don't think you want to feel it.  That's fucking brutal. 
[00:57:30]  I made it in.  I made it about 20 minutes in.  And then you panicked.  Oh, yeah, dude.  Oh, yeah.  It was, the whole thing was not handled correctly.  And then when they were identifying the bodies, that was not, was handled even worse.  It was brutal.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Oh.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to take it.  Wow.  It's just like, Bill Burr rules.  I've got to say, because we're going to get shit for it, when you said no one's watching soccer in America,  the number came out a couple days ago. 
[00:58:00]  It was something like 25 million people watched that U.S. Portugal game.  Is that the number?  Is that the number that they put it on?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, look, it was.  How can we check that?  Yeah, but it was also Sunday, 6 o'clock Eastern, 3 Pacific, a great time to sit and watch a game.  I think they said 18 million on ESPN and then another 7 million elsewhere.  Something like that.  I don't believe it.  And how many people do you know who are watching it?  I don't know anybody who's watching it.  Me and everybody.  Everybody's doing the same thing to me, going like, are you watching this shit? 
[00:58:30]  I mean, I guess people are watching it.  I was amazed on Twitter how many people were tweeting about it.  I was on live tweeting, and I was surprised that a lot of people in my time never did the same thing.  Jimmy, I checked Jimmy's Twitter while I was watching.  I'm like, holy fuck, Jimmy's watching it, too.  It's the first soccer game I've watched from beginning to end.  Oh, I picked it up 20 minutes, and it was one, U.S. was down 1-0 when I did that.  I missed that goal because I had some errands to do around the house, but besides that, I watched the whole game.  You probably could have built a house from the time it took them to score a goal. 
[00:59:00]  Dude, I was looking at fucking, nothing was happening.  I'm looking at Anthony's Twitter picture.  He posts a picture, and I'm looking at it, and I hear, oh!  I fucking missed it.  And I went, ah, what could happen?  It's soccer.  So I went and did something quickly, and I missed one of the goals.  He thought that was so stupid.  Yeah, I watched, that was the first full soccer game I ever watched.  It was, right?  I watched a little of, yeah, I watched a little of the other teams and stuff like that.  And you're going to watch most of today.  I was in a hotel room.  I was bored, and there's no commercials.  That's the reason I tuned in.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:59:30]  I mean, I don't know.  I don't like the bad acting at all.  When you watch a football game and someone just falls down, you're like, oh, the guy's  faking it.  You get so pissed.  And these guys do it like, you know, it's so brutal how they do it.  Just later.  And then they get back up and run frigging seven miles.  Come off the field and sit on the bench for a half hour, and then I'll believe that you  really get hurt.  Right.  I saw on that Barstool Sports, somebody had taken a clip from one of the games, where  this guy barely elbowed this other dude in the chest, and the guy actually waited like 
[01:00:00]  a second and a half before he actually grabbed his chest and fell to the ground.  So they actually put in like the sound of a sniper rifle.  Like the guy got shot, dude.  It's hilarious.  Bill, stay on the line, because this guy has something about soccer.  Hold on.  We got Bill Burr on the line and Steve in Connecticut.  Steve, go ahead.  How are you doing, guys?  Hey.  Went to a Holland-Germany game last year in Holland, and it's unbelievable. 
[01:00:30]  Obviously, the Dutch, you know, is 90% of the crowd.  And about the entire game, they're all screaming, in Dutch, all the Germans are homos.  And it is unbelievable, and it's to the beat of a fairly current song that I forget the  name of it.  I'm sure you could find that I'm lying.  All right.  But before I punch out, I want to apologize to any gays I've offended for being aligned  with Germans. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  Any Germans for being aligned with gays.  But it would just never happen in this country.  Yeah, it's not funny to call anyone gay, I guess, nowadays or something.  I don't know.  I can't follow the rules anymore.  Thank you, sir.  You're welcome.  No, you know, he's really bad.  I heard in Spain, they're like, I think it's Spain.  They're like some of the most, the biggest racists.  Like, the Israeli team came in there, and they wrote all this stuff about Auschwitz.  They literally made signs, and they're holding it up.  It's just like, good Lord.  And, you know, we get so much crap for that over here. 
[01:01:30]  You know, at least we're not making signs.  They don't play, man.  This guy, Corey in Jersey.  Corey, go ahead.  Bill Burr on the line with you.  Hey, Bill.  You were talking about the Liverpool fans that were killed.  It was actually 96 of them in 1989, April 16th.  It was a Hillsborough tragedy.  But, you know, the cool thing about it is I've been supporting Liverpool since about then. 
[01:02:00]  And they've been fighting for 25 years now to get the truth to come out.  The government has been involved in this big cover-up.  And you, being a conspiracy guy, would like that.  But it's been discovered that, yeah, the police ignored a lot of things,  and they blamed the Liverpool fans.  And, in fact, it was the lack of police.  Yeah, that 30-for-30, they kind of break it down how it was a new guy  who was head of the security force. 
[01:02:30]  And, like, you know, people who are in the crowd control, they watch it,  and then they start, you know, just going right down the checklist  of everything they're doing wrong.  Dude, it's so creepy because they have the security video  as you start seeing everybody going in through the same entrance  because they want to stand behind the goalkeeper.  And on the left and the right side was wide open,  but they had put, like, these partitions up so people couldn't, I don't know,  battle with each other section to section.  And everybody went to the middle, and no one was stopping them.  Dude, it was, yeah.  I tried to get out of this 10 minutes ago. 
[01:03:00]  I'm sorry to keep bringing me.  You brought it up, though.  Actually, it wasn't 86.  It was 96.  You know, Steve Christ.  Right, all right.  We just all agree it's horrific.  Okay, we can move on.  Thank you, Corey.  Let's say hi to one more call here.  Kyle in New York.  Kyle.  How's it going, fellas?  Good morning.  Good morning.  All right.  Two things to you.  First of all, Jimmy, that tweet about the lawnmower on the field.  Oh, thank you.  For hours. 
[01:03:30]  Dying for hours.  But there's a good movie out.  I don't know if you guys have ever seen it.  Green Street Hooligans.  It's pretty old.  It has Elijah Wood in it.  And it's about the soccer clubs over in Europe and how they brawl to the depth over soccer matches.  And it's a pretty fucking intense movie that really makes you realize how serious people take their fucking soccer.  Right.  Well, I don't think it's as bad as it used to be.  But I don't know.  What's this?  Gary Oldman did.  He did a film, I think, called The Firm.  Not like the Tom Cruise one. 
[01:04:00]  I mean, The Firm, like the supporters of things.  He did one.  And there's a book called Among the Thugs, where it's an American journalist who goes over there and hangs out with them.  You know, who knows?  Who knows how much he's sensationalizing so a dummy like me will read his book.  Right.  He seemed pretty crazy over there.  But, I mean, this was like 25 years ago, so what else?  All right.  Well, enough with soccer, I guess.  I'm looking at photos as we're talking of the Hillsborough incident.  You are?  Yeah.  You can see people crushed up against the fence. 
[01:04:30]  It's quite claustrophobic.  I can't imagine being in that situation.  That would be horrific.  Yeah.  You just want to turn around and go back the other way, I'm sure.  Yeah, let's get out of here.  Right, right.  You're not going anywhere.  Man.  What else is going on?  Third time around.  Here we go, guys.  Well, you, I didn't even know about this thing.  No, this is all my fault.  I apologize.  But then what happens, though, you pique our interest, so then we're like, all right, we need to know a little more about it.  But, man, whatever.  What else is going on, Bill?  Ah, nothing.  I'm in Pittsburgh. 
[01:05:00]  I just did a benefit.  It was actually a great benefit where they had a stage.  There was a microphone.  People were set up to look at you.  And it was fun.  I actually complimented the people who ran it because so many times you agree to do these benefits.  And, you know, you show up, there's no stage, there's no light.  And they just, hey, go over there and go stand in the corner.  And it's just, you're just like this loud guy who stood up at a table all of a sudden.  And you start bombing.  Then you attack the crowd. 
[01:05:30]  And the whole thing goes down the shit.  But, unfortunately, it was a good one, though.  Sometimes you guys do these gigs and they don't even have a microphone for you?  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, my God.  I did one at a restaurant.  It was a Christmas party in the afternoon.  Right.  And I said, yeah, it's a separate part of the restaurant.  You'll have a mic and all that stuff.  I got there.  There was no mic and there was no separate room.  I stood in the middle of the restaurant in front of, like, two tables.  There was waiters and other people right next to me were just eating.  They weren't even part of it.  And stood there with no microphone and told jokes to two tables. 
[01:06:00]  How'd you do?  Horrendous.  Man.  There was kids next to me behind me.  The fact that you survived it is amazing.  And it was like $125.  I'm like, I'll do it.  And even when I got there, I'm like, all right, I need to make this money.  Right.  Did it for $125.  Stood there for 30 minutes.  As busboys were banging into me on my punchlines.  Holy shit.  The things you guys do.  I remember a long time ago I got booked to do some Christmas party, right?  On the Upper East Side. 
[01:06:30]  And I showed up and it was just like this Illuminati level cash that was at the place with this small restaurant.  There's like 40 people.  They had no idea there was going to be a show.  I was supposed to be like a surprise.  And they could all give a fuck.  It was a show.  They all just had like that.  I own a yacht.  Oh, fuck.  Like sort of haircut combined.  I don't think it's like the hockey haircut, but it's like more like curls in the back.  And they all have like a white polo shirt.  I was bombing so bad at one point I actually considered saying, listen, just tell you what. 
[01:07:00]  How about you guys just keep the money and I'm just going to leave now.  Right.  It was that embarrassing.  How much time did you have to do?  Do you remember?  Oh, dude.  I think I did like 20.  I think they wanted me to do a half hour.  There was like people like I was so I got so defensive because I was bombing so bad that I was getting even angrier.  And it was just literally it was like people stopped looking at me sort of looking down at their plates. 
[01:07:30]  And nobody and I'd be like, come on, guys, you know, Jesus, give me something.  And nobody would say anything.  My agent was there.  Oh, my God.  You know, it's funny.  Right outside was this amazing like holiday snow.  Right.  Like an inch of snow.  It looked like I was actually in the Christmas spirit.  And I went in there and I remember walking back to the subway, talking to my agent, going, I'm never fucking doing one of those again.  Don't even bring me the offer and blah, blah, blah.  And, of course, he brought me another one. 
[01:08:00]  I needed the money.  So I was like, all right, this is the last one.  Wow.  Yeah.  Even when they're good, they're not.  They're rough.  But even when they're good, they're scary.  They don't worry.  I've done bachelor parties before, and those are brutal.  Because you've got a stripper coming in.  They're always like, we're going to put you on after the dance.  I go, no, put me on before, please.  Right, right.  The groomer's going to get blown in front of everybody.  I can't follow that.  Just let me do my fucking horse and pony show for 15 minutes.  Jesus.  At least bachelor parties you could curse, though.  You could be dirty at a bachelor party and go down being filthy. 
[01:08:30]  The worst, the company parties are horrible because they think they want it edgy, but nobody else knows you're coming and they don't want it dirty.  It's terrible.  I just don't know how you guys do that.  I don't know how you come back from it.  I did one in Vegas for a bunch of oilmen, and I showed up, and they were such fucking assholes that I was actually up there making fun of them, and they didn't even get it.  Like, I was talking about how many oily birds there were out there because of their business. 
[01:09:00]  And I go, but you guys don't give a shit, right?  And I did some, you know, horrific Southern accent saying something along the lines of, like, you know, well, you know, if you can't fly with oil on it, it's too much of a pussy.  And there was this pause, and then the whole crowd went, like, yeah!  And they didn't even, like, laugh.  Like, they thought I was giving, like, a speech or something.  A pep rally.  Yeah, and then I remember afterwards, they all came up, like, yeah, sorry about that.  We're hard on our performers. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, God damn it.  Yeah, like, I passed some tests.  Right.  Yeah, it was horrific.  Well, you guys, for the most part, don't have to do those gigs anymore, right?  I remember I was doing comedy, like, six months, and I got an offer to open for Edgar Winter, and his crowd was all bikers at the Club Binet.  It was like a supper club.  Yeah.  And they started throwing steaks at me, the bikers, and their potatoes when I was on stage.  And I had to do 15 minutes, and I was getting 50 bucks, so I'm staying.  I just told them, I go, look, I'm staying up. 
[01:10:00]  You can throw all the shit you want.  And then I just started eating the food off the stage, and they were going fucking nuts.  They went nuts for that?  They went crazy.  And I did my time.  I just keep throwing it.  Fucking throw.  Give me a rare one.  Throw that up.  And they were just firing shit at me.  You guys should get together and write a book about bombing.  Edgar, he wanted to take me on the road.  He's like, no one's ever lasted that long.  Come on the road with me.  I'm like, fuck this.  I had all my family there, too.  It was like my first big gig.  Right.  And they were just throwing shit at me.  And you're just eating the food they're throwing at you.  Right off the stage.  A book about-  You know what's hilarious about that?  It's like, Edgar, well, then, why don't you stop booking comedians? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Exactly.  He enjoyed it.  He was probably a sadist who kind of enjoyed the show, watching guys just get fucking shit  thrown at them.  That's his thing.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we do have to take a break here.  Bill, you got anything going on?  We got a lot going on.  The podcast is still rocking, by the way.  The podcast is doing well.  Other than that, I just taped my next special.  I just taped last weekend down in Atlanta.  Oh, nice.  I'm scampering around, trying to come up with another hour of horseshit before that thing 
[01:11:00]  comes out.  Hey, Bill, are you guys still doing that tour?  Lawson and Verzee and Bartnick?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Lawhead, Verzee, and Bartnick are...  Actually, I'm in Vegas this weekend, and Friday, Saturday, and then Sunday, those guys  are coming through the all-in tour.  And it's been doing really, really well.  They've been selling tickets and killing it.  And I know they just crushed it down in Philly.  So thank you for bringing that up, by the way.  No, because I saw them at the Stress Factory in Jersey.  Great. 
[01:11:30]  What is it?  I don't even know what this is.  Bill's Comic Friends.  Okay.  They're three great comics and stuff.  They're doing a whole tour.  Oh, nice.  And they're killing it.  And basically, the guys who've been opening for me throughout the years, you know, they  came to my wedding, and they started talking.  I was like, why don't you guys do a tour?  I'll put the podcast name behind it.  But, you know, because back in the day, like when I went out with some of the guys on Chappelle's  show tour, I went out and I opened, and all these clubs that I couldn't get in, all  the improvs at that time, they got to see me, you know, do 20 minutes.  And then, you know, by the end of the tour, like, you know, a third quarter of them, whatever, 
[01:12:00]  brought me back and started to build me up in a market.  So I'm trying to get those guys onto that level, you know?  Oh, very cool.  Yeah, and they're all good comics, too, man.  Right.  I'll have to check it out.  All right, Bill.  Always a pleasure, man.  I like the surprise calls.  Are you at an airport right now?  Yeah, I'm here in Pittsburgh, and I'm flying back to L.A.  Another benefit tonight.  Nothing but respect.  You call from an airport, and you kill it for us on the radio. 
[01:12:30]  That is not easy.  No.  Who's around you right now?  On East Coast time, where, you know, he's a West Coast guy.  But where are you?  Oh, actually, I'm over by the moving sidewalk.  Oh, okay.  You got to wait for all the people.  Yeah.  Oh, dude, I swear to God, this fucking guy was standing on the moving sidewalk.  He was right in the middle, so nobody, and the guy in front of me stops.  And I got to stop.  Right.  And I'm thinking, it's just, hit this fucking asshole over.  And, of course, when he gets off it, he's, like, hobbling around like something was wrong with his leg. 
[01:13:00]  Like, I was just, I was just like, really?  I have to, this early in the morning, I figure out what an asshole I am.  Even make it to 8 a.m.  It's better you find out early in the morning, though.  And adjust appropriately for the rest of the day.  All right.  I was watching this couple, a couple of fatties, two of them just sitting there, and his wife is just chowing, just eating with their mouthful.  I'm literally three tables away, glaring at her, because I can hear it. 
[01:13:30]  At first, when people use their mouthful, but I'm thinking, all right, maybe it's a glitch.  Maybe it's just a big piece of something they put in there, and she's just sitting there, smack it away.  I don't know.  I got issues.  Sorry, guys.  All right.  I got to jump off here.  They're starting to board the flight.  All right.  Hey, I'll be there in July, man.  Yeah.  I'll swing by.  Absolutely.  We look forward to it.  All right, Bill.  Thank you, buddy.  See you, man.  See you, Jim.  Bye, everyone.  Live from Pittsburgh Airport.  Jesus.  I've been in an airport before.  And doing great.  Yeah.  Doing great with the phone. 
[01:14:00]  So, let's take a break.  Florentine's here, and we got Rich Voss coming in.  Stay there.  Ah, yes.  We got Jim Florentine in the studio today.  Killing it for us.  Talking about bucket lists.  I don't think so.  It's that Molly Cruz song, Who We Are It's Holiday.  That's the one with the old singer.  Right.  I remember this got some airplay.  It wasn't that bad.  Not as a good song. 
[01:14:30]  And we welcome Rich Voss into the studio.  This is your walk-on music.  I don't want to hear it.  It's going to be a fucking slam already in the morning.  Just something negative. 
[01:15:00]  First of all, I wanted to come in and say, I was thinking about this in the car.  First of all, Aunt Rich is hypersensitive.  It's a Motley Crue song.  Why don't you put your headphones on and hear it?  Because I don't know Motley Crue.  I could hear anything.  I couldn't tell you it was Motley Crue.  Is your left arm dying?  No, why?  Why?  It looks discolored.  It's because of her tattoos.  I see the tattoos, but...  Again, that's a cover-up that I did at a more length.  You're doing more cover-up?  Stop with the cover-up.  You know how many layers of paint you got on that left arm?  My Jewish star was covered up. 
[01:15:30]  I know, I know.  Oh, really?  I'm going to put it in here.  Oh, okay.  Why are you getting so many tattoos?  You got full sleeves still.  Because I fucking ran out of shit to buy, so this is all that's left.  What tattoos are new since the last time we saw you, which was a month ago?  No, I just got that one.  What is that?  It's a sober thing.  For a 12-step program.  Oh, okay.  It's a sober thing.  And, you know, not that I'm fucking driving back to...  Yeah, I should have fucking hair on it.  Tumbleweed, I swear to God. 
[01:16:00]  But, you know, I was thinking about this when I was driving.  What is that one?  I don't remember seeing the bird one.  What, these?  On your right arm.  You don't even know where...  Oh, you do have a lot of bird tattoos.  Sorry.  Why a lot of bird tattoos?  What are you, an Arizona Cardinal fan?  Well, no, when I...  That's my high school team was...  High school was Cardinals.  Ew!  You're high school?  I went to the Cardinals, yeah.  Because I didn't graduate, so I figured I'd get something out of it.  Ew, you're high school fucking...  This is an Oriole.  This is an Oriole.  This is an Oriole.  Where's your Little League team?  This is more competing right here.  Where's your T-Ball team on your back? 
[01:16:30]  Hold on.  Why would you put a place that you had failed in so miserably on your arm?  Huh?  I said, why would you put a place?  Huh?  Huh?  I don't know.  You got your high school mascot on your left arm?  Yeah, the Cardinals in that story.  Orioles were my favorite team growing up.  Don't tell anyone why you have...  Why do you have the Red...  Just say, I like Redbirds.  Right.  And that's fine.  Wait, you liked the Baltimore Orioles growing up?  Yeah, well, I played on the Orioles in Little League.  Me too.  So, because of that, you had to follow the Major League version?  I was very good. 
[01:17:00]  You were very good.  I actually was on the Cardinals for my Little League, but I didn't go and follow the St.  Louis Cardinals after that.  Well, I did.  I just was on...  What's the other birds?  Might as well do all the birds.  That's the girl, the pin-up girl playing.  No, you got...  Oh, you got...  Why do you have two Cardinals?  Because it would be awkward if it was just one flying.  Okay.  Without meeting anybody.  Two mascots?  Without, no.  It's just...  And what's the bird...  What is that on your right inside elbow?  Fucking skeleton bird.  That bird. 
[01:17:30]  Ah.  Just a bird?  Just birds.  Humming birds or something.  I don't know.  I like to hum and sing in the morning.  Wake up in a good mood.  Wendy, you've never woken up in a good mood.  I mean, I know.  If you had fucking Angelina Jolie and, I don't know, somebody else in bed with you, you  still wouldn't be in a good mood.  See, I wouldn't let him laugh to the morning.  Get the fuck out.  And they were going to pay for your golf.  If you were going to golf with Tiger Woods, you still wouldn't be in a good mood.  You'd still be fucking cranky.  What if you heard him hum?  I've never heard him hum.  I've never heard of him.  If you were in a restaurant, you'd see me. 
[01:18:00]  But I was driving in, and I wish Andy was here, and this is serious, and this is sincere.  Right.  I wanted to thank you guys.  I've been coming on here for like 12 years, and it's done absolutely nothing for my fucking  career.  But not get me into other radio shows around the country.  Have guys come to the show that can't look me in the face.  Why can't they look you in the face?  Because your listeners have no esteem. 
[01:18:30]  They just fucking stare at the ground and wait for their mom to pick them up after the  show.  It's fucking horrible.  We've got really strange listeners.  I was thinking about that a lot lately.  There's a lot of strange ones out there.  There's some that really know Tommy.  And they're extremely obsessed.  Good.  Either in a good way or a bad way.  Anyone that tweets me and goes, tis, tis, like his stupid character, they get fat.  They fucking block.  They block them?  They get blocked immediately. 
[01:19:00]  That makes me so happy.  They get blocked so quick.  Just the fact that a grown-up guy is copying a radio personality's horrible character.  They get blocked.  Yeah, well, you block them.  I've seen so many times when Bonnie will retweet something.  Your husband blocked me.  I'm a fan, but your stupid husband blocked me.  He told him to block me.  She always retweets that shit.  Go stay trotted.  I don't want to get into this.  We've done it in a long time.  Well, you're going to be blocking so many people now.  Your mentions are all going to be tis, tis today. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, they just chip.  What's wrong with that?  It's a little chip.  Guess what?  Block, block.  Yeah, I don't really.  Yeah.  It's just easier to block people.  You know what it is?  I can see some.  Because you can't.  But when you get an adult doing it, you know, someone with kids and, hey, look, I'm a listener  to this.  Go fuck yourself, you jerk off.  All right?  Be original.  Say something.  Yeah.  You know what I mean.  Fuck yeah.  Guess what?  July 8th.  July 8th coming out. 
[01:20:00]  July 8th, yes.  Okay.  In the August penthouse issue, it comes out July 8th.  Bonnie and I have a seven-page interview.  Seven fucking pages.  I don't even know it was a magazine anymore.  Neither did I.  Neither did I.  Seven pages.  They interview you for seven.  Is that?  It's kind of like a crazy.  Do you have that much to talk about?  No.  What are you guys talking about in the magazine?  Do you know people are going to be jerking off and then just disappointed as they're about  to come and they just see, all right, these two are talking and you've got to keep  turning the pages.  Maybe someone likes it.  That's what jerking off is. 
[01:20:30]  That's what I wanted to do.  Why do they interview you?  Are you guys famous or something?  I had a lot of shit going on.  Big, big shit.  Big, big, big, big, big shit.  What do you got going on?  Hey, you can't tell.  You know, I'm just, you know, we signed a contract with the movie.  That's sold.  Oh, good.  You did?  Not sold.  We've got a distributor.  It's done?  Well, the distributor has it.  Now they're going to...  But now you don't have to worry about it anymore.  When does it come out?  Going to Montreal, doing our podcast.  Hold on.  When does the movie come out for everybody?  They finally watched.  It's September. 
[01:21:00]  That's what they said.  All right.  You know, we got...  I'll show you the artwork.  Kind of like an iTunes thing?  Yeah.  They're going to try to go to iTunes for two months with exclusivity and then move on.  You thought I was going to say that wrong, didn't you?  It was fun, but you slowed down because you knew.  So it's just things, you know, whatever.  I mean, it's keeping us together.  I got your podcast equipment.  What's that?  I got your podcast equipment.  What?  I keep hearing about this, and I was wondering... 
[01:21:30]  I bought it today.  You did?  Yeah.  So I've decided I don't want a podcast.  I looked at this box of crap for a year.  I said, Rich, you take it.  I'm like, why do I want a podcast?  We got a radio show.  It's so stupid.  Do you have equipment?  Yeah.  I was ready to go.  And then I decided, you know...  Now, when you see how many people are podcasting, I just...  My mailman's doing one now.  Probably.  I know.  Probably.  I don't even know if that's a joke.  I mean, the equipment you have probably is outdated already because every six months  is changing.  Is it really?  Whatever you bought is probably... 
[01:22:00]  Well, we haven't bought shit in three years.  Yeah, probably.  It'll upgrade their shit.  Well, you could do yours.  You could travel.  You got one.  I just got a little Zoom recorder.  I just do it right...  That's all I need.  Yeah, that's all I do.  Yeah.  Just do it right in the air.  Really?  Yeah.  You could do it anywhere?  Yeah, I do it anywhere.  You got to be online to download it.  Yeah, I'll blow that shit away.  Why are you amazed by this?  Huh?  That you could do a podcast from anywhere.  Why are you amazed by this?  The same reason you're amazed why I have Cardinals on my arm.  Little things amaze people.  He's a sweet boy.  He gets very excited about Cardinals.  But you got those Cardinals.  Like, have you got them right in high school? 
[01:22:30]  Like, when he graduated or almost graduated?  I didn't graduate.  I know, but almost graduated.  He got them last week.  I know.  That's weird because...  Right.  I could see back then.  You're like, all right.  I was, you know, it was a stupid thing I did when I was in...  It's just as weird as an adult wearing a rock band t-shirt.  No, it's not.  You're not wearing it forever.  Yeah, I'm going to put it in the wash in about three hours.  He's not stuck with it.  Yeah.  We both, you know, Florentine...  But who thinks about their high school when they're pushing 60? 
[01:23:00]  Never.  You know what the thing is?  Florentine is like the nicest guy on the planet.  Like, when we sat around just triaging each other.  But he is like slowly becoming as fucked up as we are, like being mean and stuff.  He was never a mean guy.  And he's turning into a mean guy.  He was a creepy sexual...  You know what I mean?  What are you trying to say?  What's the name of your high school?  What do you mean?  Plainfield.  Plainfield High.  Can we look at the Plainfield High mascot?  And they were...  Now it's a guy with a gun. 
[01:23:30]  And they were the Plainfield...  It's a jailbird.  They were the Plainfield Cardinals?  Oh, there it is.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  My high school was the Cardinals, too.  And I didn't get it on my arm.  Well, you don't have any tattoos.  No.  My high school had a...  Look up the North Brunswick Raiders.  They had a terrible...  It was like a fucking...  Some dumb bird.  But it wasn't like a...  It was a real bird, I don't think.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Like a bird in a jersey. 
[01:24:00]  Some kind of like...  What's he wearing?  Eagle thing, right?  Oh, is it?  Oh, it's changed.  It used to be like this awful yellow bird.  Yeah, they made it cooler, I guess.  My high school was the Tornadoes.  Are you kidding me?  The 18 names.  Tornadoes don't even hit Long Island.  What the fuck?  Why would they pick the Tornadoes?  They probably figured it was like a tornado coming through,  just tearing stuff up.  Yeah, just fucking...  It should have been Traffic Jam.  Huh.  Hmm.  Still early.  Still got a lot of time. 
[01:24:30]  I don't know if you do.  We'll have to cut this one short.  I got to drive to fucking Boston.  Yeah, what's going on in Boston?  That Laugh Boston, that new club.  Have you been up there?  No, I haven't.  It's fucking nice, man.  Who's running it?  Who's running it?  Yeah.  Same players?  No, no.  These other guys.  But it's really a nice club and a big...  It's in a beautiful hotel, which is the best when you're doing a club.  When the room is in the hotel you're staying, where you just fucking roll downstairs, you 
[01:25:00]  know, have to cross town in traffic.  It's fucking the best.  Where is the place?  It's on Summer Street.  Okay.  I'm trying to get people to go.  So it's in the hotel?  The gig's in the hotel?  Yeah.  Some big hotel, whatever.  I don't know the name of the hotel.  The gig's in the hotel and they've got a new comedy club up there.  Yeah.  Laugh Boston.  It's a beautiful club.  It's like...  Bonnie just did the female festival up there, which she hates.  God, that sounds horrible.  Why is she stuck doing female festivals?  Well, they asked her last...  Because they were paying her good money. 
[01:25:30]  They flew her up.  Well, why can't you just do festivals?  Why does it have to be a special female festival?  We're doing Montreal.  But because she's a female, and sometimes they ask her, and she fucking...  She can't stand it.  She just hates it.  Good for her.  She trashed her.  She should, yes.  But for the money, it's hard to say no sometimes.  They offer you a lot of money to do 15-minute sets.  It's like...  Your last 15 years.  Jesus. 
[01:26:00]  So we're going up...  Last fucking week, I had the worst week in my life.  I've got to tell you this story.  It's boring.  I was supposed to work in New Orleans last Friday and Saturday for good money.  I added a Sunday in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, which is a four-hour drive.  So I'd go in, do Thursday, Friday, Saturday in fucking New Orleans, and then drive to Fort  Walton Beach on Sunday, do the show, and come back Monday and fly out.  Well, the club never fucking opened in New Orleans. 
[01:26:30]  So I had my plane ticket.  It was supposedly Lucky Comedy Club.  Well, I guess it wasn't.  So it was a brand-new club, and they just assumed it was going to be done in time to have Rich Voss?  Well, it was supposed to be open a month before me with, like, you know...  I understand that, but leading up to your date, didn't they tell you, like, ah, it's not looking good?  Or were they trying...  No, I get kind of crazy at this fucking night.  They were telling you nowhere it's going to be opened?  I said, send me my deposit for the plane ticket.  The guy gets on the phone.  He goes, oh, my dad just passed away. 
[01:27:00]  So I'm scrambling.  I'm going, let me buy the plane ticket before it goes up even higher and higher, you know.  So next thing you know, the club doesn't open.  And I get a letter, an email, and it's got to be from him, but this is his lawyer, so-and-so committed suicide.  Really?  What are the odds that dad dies and he just committed suicide?  But it's not true.  He was just saying that because he was just a crazy guy.  Wait, he committed suicide, but is he dead?  No, but he's nowhere to be found. 
[01:27:30]  He was just some guy that thought he could open a club, and he's telling everybody...  Wait, the guy that was supposed to open the club supposedly committed suicide, but he might not have committed suicide?  Doesn't that usually happen to your audiences after?  What do you mean this is a boring story?  This is fucked up.  Yeah, I know.  There's a death and a suicide and a fucking missed plane.  This is a great story.  God, you just can't read things properly.  Why would you think this is a boring story?  Because it's bullshit.  The guy said he committed suicide.  Well, where is the guy?  I don't know.  His phone was cut off the day after. 
[01:28:00]  So now people are saying he didn't commit suicide.  Hold on.  I'm good at this.  I am.  So the guy, there was a rumor he committed suicide, but now they're saying that they're  sure he didn't commit suicide.  Well, no one even knows if his name was a real name.  He might even have a victitious name.  What?  The guy who had a what?  A victitious name.  Oh, victitious.  I thought he said victitious.  He's saying, you know, saying he was going to open his club.  You didn't get a deposit before the gig?  Like half the money? 
[01:28:30]  No, I was asking for the deposit.  He goes, hey, man, I've been out of town.  My dad passed away.  But, you know, we're going to, you know, it's opening.  We're getting he was giving these big names for the grand opening.  And and another comic who books a lot of rooms turned me on to this guy.  So I thought it was legitimate.  The guy who turned me on to him, I don't want to use his name, has like three real rooms  because, yeah, this guy's opening in New Orleans.  Why don't you know, can I give him your number?  I go, yeah, of course.  I've never worked in New Orleans. 
[01:29:00]  So the guy calls me.  He goes, yeah, we're opening.  We're going to have a hard opening with this with this major act, this act.  Which major acts?  I think he said Damon.  And I don't know who the other ones were.  Right.  You know who he was going to open with.  So then, you know, so I'm going, well, there's no club in New Orleans.  So I guess now finally they're opening a club.  So I said, send me a deposit for the airfare.  He goes, oh, no problem.  So a week or two weeks go by.  No deposit.  Three weeks.  And I get a hold of him.  He goes, yeah, everything's on track. 
[01:29:30]  It's just my dad passed away.  So I bought the plane ticket without thinking.  You're stupid.  How much was it?  No, it was $450.  But let me finish.  Weren't you suspicious at all during this whole process?  No, because it's no one really.  A lot of times you'll get booked.  Right.  And the club might close that's already been open or they'll say, well, they'll fuck with  the money or whatever.  All right.  So you weren't suspicious because of your knowledge.  And you've got to buy a ticket because the guy's an asshole. 
[01:30:00]  Well, but you've got to buy the ticket because the price keeps going up.  And the guy that turned me on to him is pretty legitimate.  So I buy the ticket.  Now I hear there's nowhere to be found.  I get an email.  Chris, I think his name was Chris, if I looked it up, committed suicide.  I'm his lawyer.  Or I'm his friend and we're taking care of all his business.  I go, well, then just send me my flight money.  Right.  And we're cool.  Right. 
[01:30:30]  So two weeks go by.  I go, no fucking flight money.  I go, I'm going to go on the fucking radio and trash everything about you guys and go  on Twitter and this ad.  Then I get an email from him.  If you run my good friend's name through the mud, I'll sue you.  I go, I write back.  Don't you think I know how to do fucking radio without getting sued?  I've been doing it for 20 years.  I'm not going to get sued.  I'm just going to tell the true story.  And I never heard from him again.  Right.  So now I'm stuck with this ticket.  So the guy that originally set this up, I go, you've got to find me something. 
[01:31:00]  So last Thursday.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm not ready to move on from this.  So is there an actual club?  No, it never opened.  So it never opened?  You didn't check online?  People did research.  I kept checking online.  To see if it opened.  To see if it opened.  Is it a club that they're trying to open up?  Well, not now.  I kept checking online.  Not now, because the guy either committed suicide or he disappeared.  Or he just never happened.  But why did he disappear?  Because he fucking booked all these people and they're all looking for him. 
[01:31:30]  You know, for probably deposits.  I'm not the only one.  Why couldn't they get the club open?  They ran out of funds or something?  He probably, I heard he went to some warehouse and he, you know, after people did research  of where it was going to be.  Right.  It was just some fucking warehouse.  Maybe he couldn't get the liquor license, too.  That happens sometimes.  They have a problem with the liquor license and they're like, it's not worth it.  He had all different permits and stuff to open the club.  Yeah.  He probably didn't have the money.  He probably had a dream with no fucking money.  He probably thought he could do it with this kind of money.  All right.  You can move on.  So you told your guy to find something in New Orleans because you got the plane ticket. 
[01:32:00]  Because I have this Sunday still.  You know, I had the Sunday in Fort Walton Beach.  It's only a thousand for the Sunday.  But added to the weekend, it made it a big, you know, a big weekend.  And I kind of didn't want to cancel the Sunday, the last minute, even though these guys are  assholes, you know, their company.  So the guy gets me a Thursday night in New Orleans.  I fly down Thursday.  So, uh, empty.  Then he gets me Friday and Saturday at the Hard Rock in Houston. 
[01:32:30]  So I fly from New Orleans Friday morning to Houston.  It's a small room, but it was great.  This is a 50 seat room, but it was fun.  Actually, it was fun.  So I did four shows there.  I got up.  This is a fucking night.  I got up Sunday morning, flew back to New Orleans and drove 250 miles to do the Sunday  night in Fort Walton Beach.  Right.  I'm sorry.  Right.  I did a Sunday night, just a big 200, 200 people, 300 following fucking dueling pianos. 
[01:33:00]  You know, uh, the middle act is, is a cool dude.  So it was from Atlanta.  Some big dude.  I forget his name.  He's fun to work with.  I get up three 30 Monday morning to drive back to New Orleans to fly out.  Oh, the flight's fucking canceled.  Then they finally fly me and set it straight to Newark to Houston.  And then I have, that's delayed.  I get home at one in the morning.  I left at three 30 a.m. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, my God.  And I get home at fucking one in the morning.  It's 22 hours.  And this is Monday.  I'm home Tuesday and Wednesday and now I got to drive.  Why'd they cancel your, why'd they cancel your flight?  Uh, they said mechanical.  The flight never came in.  And, and, and then they scram and they're so, I mean.  So they wouldn't put you on another airline to get you directly home from Florida or New Orleans?  They were putting on people that had flights overseas, connections and flights overseas.  Are you United?  Yeah.  Are you like a gold member or silver? 
[01:34:00]  So they should have taken care of you.  Right.  They put me in first class from, uh, from New Orleans to Houston and Houston to, uh, to Newark,  which means nothing to me because a flight from New Orleans to Newark is like three hours.  Yeah.  And I, I, you know, I'll fall asleep anyhow.  There wasn't any earlier flights from Houston to Newark?  Because there's always flights going out like every hour.  They couldn't throw you on.  They couldn't get, get us to Houston.  Those flights were all booked.  Oh, right.  Okay.  They couldn't get us to Houston.  Okay.  Those flights were all booked.  They should put you on another airline.  Well, they put us other people on other airlines that had to fly, you know, to Newark. 
[01:34:30]  Right, right.  To Israel or wherever the fuck promised land they were going to.  So I got to find this fucking guy's name.  I wish I had it now because if you're in New Orleans, I want you to find this fucking guy  and get my goddamn deposit.  Uh, all three listeners in New Orleans.  I want you guys to fucking.  But you still went there with the original ticket.  Yeah.  All right.  So you got something out of it.  I still want my plane ticket because I had to pay.  Did you make just as much money as original?  No. 
[01:35:00]  No.  I probably made, you know, a couple, enough to still pay my bills that week.  You know, it wasn't a loss.  But, you know, my ticket was $4.50, but still I had to buy another round trip ticket to Houston,  right, which was to, I had to get a hotel in New Orleans on Thursday night myself.  Wait, do you have a signed contract?  Huh?  Yeah, there's no way you're getting your money back.  No.  I mean, the guy in New Orleans. 
[01:35:30]  I have emails.  Emails are not as good.  Yeah, but he's not going to get it.  You're not getting your money back.  The thing with those gigs is get at least 10% of whatever you're going to get.  You're getting $3,000 for the weekend, get $300.  Send them directly to us.  I need a 10% deposit.  That will cover the airfare if things get fucked up.  That's what, you know, our Asian does with the, even with the improvs and stuff like that.  They always get 10%, not that the improvs would fuck you over, but just get that.  Well, not, they're not going to just close.  Not like that, they're not going to.  No, no, not at all. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, they're not setting up in warehouses in the middle of nowhere.  Send me 10% and I'm in.  As soon as I get to 10%, let's confirm the date.  Well, I usually try to get my, yeah, my airfare fund, but nine out of 10 clubs I work, I've  worked there for years, so I'm not worried about it.  So you think they came up with that scheme to say that he committed suicide, so people  would go, oh, fuck, that sucks.  I'm a lawyer.  I'm going to sue you.  And leave him alone?  Yeah.  So you can get out of some of this shit?  He goes, I'll send you the money.  So every two weeks.  But the lawyer guy was probably him.  It was him.  Okay.  It was him.  And every week, he was, I would call and go, oh, no check yet. 
[01:36:30]  Next week, you're a real stand-up guy.  Still waiting.  You know, just dumb shit.  But I didn't, whatever, it's just such scumbags in this world.  This guy, it might be a girl from New Orleans here.  Who's this?  Might be able to add to the situation.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Alyssa in New Orleans.  Oh, hi, Alyssa.  What's up?  Hi.  I don't have much to add, but my husband and I go to comedy probably twice a week, and  we live right downtown, and we stay really up on everything that's going on down here. 
[01:37:00]  Right.  We've never heard of this joint.  Because it never opened.  Where was it supposed to open?  You know the address?  No, and you know how you get, like, the free, like, city pages to see all the shit that's  going on?  Right.  We get it every week.  It's never, I've never seen one mention of this joint.  Well, you know what, Google, I don't know, where was it supposed to be?  You know the address?  The street?  Anything?  What was the name of the club?  Lucky's?  In New Orleans?  Lucky's.  In New Orleans. 
[01:37:30]  Do this, this guy was supposed to write an article about it, so Google Lucky, and see if  the article came out.  There's no article.  You're still believing it.  If you Google the word lucky, there's no way that's the first thing to know.  No, listen.  When I Googled it.  No, no.  What's that?  No, no.  A writer.  When I Googled it.  I can look up the writer's name and see if he wrote the article, because he was interviewing  a bunch of people.  Rich, one thing you are is street smart, so how do you get taken so bad?  I didn't get taken.  I think he got taken on this. 
[01:38:00]  No, I just, no, the guy just never fucking opened the club.  He ripped you off.  He just, he just, he did, the guy's.  There's no real info on this club anywhere.  Well, if I could find the, oh, I, what's that?  I want to know his name.  I'm dying to know his name.  Well, really, if you're dying over that, Jesus.  I don't know.  I got to find his email, and it's probably on my email at home.  His name was Chris something, but it's probably not even a real name, because, you know, he  probably gave a fake name from the beginning. 
[01:38:30]  Don't give his name out on the air, just in case he gave somebody else's name.  Yeah.  Right.  All right.  All right, guys, thanks.  Thank you.  That's it for that.  Do you want me to just give you the deposit?  How much was it?  No, I'll make it up this week.  In Boston?  I'll make it up with my new CD that's coming out.  Lucky's, right there, Lucky's.  With my new CD that's coming out, Rich Voss, 141 IQ.  I'll make it up with that.  That's the new one CD?  Is that coming out?  Yeah.  Well, it'll be done next week, and then I'll get it however long to get it on iTunes and 
[01:39:00]  stuff.  So, you know, whatever.  You know, it'll probably come out when the Penthouse article comes out.  A mover and a shaker there.  Penthouse article, new CD.  It's other bigger things.  Why can't you talk about them?  Yeah, you just don't talk about it.  It's not going to jinx it.  Nobody's listening that might jinx it.  Where would that jinx come from?  Yeah, what is it?  Where would it come from?  Where would it come from?  20 years of my career.  Where would it come from?  It's not.  No one's going to go.  If he mentions this on the radio, this is not happening. 
[01:39:30]  Do you want to know something amazing?  This is what I heard.  Dave Chappelle sold out 10 nights, 6,000 seats a night.  He sold more tickets in one week than I did all year.  All the years since you started.  Isn't that fucking insane?  Give us a hint on what's going on with you guys.  Nothing.  Just, you know, me and Bonnie have a little interest.  That's, you know, a little interest.  But seriously, what do you think might happen? 
[01:40:00]  Is it because you think you're going to jinx it if you talk about it?  Listen, I've done how, you know how many fucking things I've done that didn't pan out?  So who cares?  So what?  Who cares?  I do.  I mean, either way, it's either going to happen or it's not going to happen.  It's my kids.  No, that's what I'm, exactly what he said.  It's not going to make a difference if you bring it up right now.  If it's going to happen or not.  It's really not.  You can at least brag about it a little bit.  No, because I'll be able to brag Friday or Monday.  Friday or Monday.  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  TV?  It's...  TV.  Okay, so it's TV.  It's not TV.  It's probably a TV show with Bonnie and Rich.  Reality?  Reality TV show?  Yeah.  It's nice to hear.  Okay, so it's a reality show.  All right, reality show.  With Rich and Bonnie.  On the Lifetime channel.  No.  Or maybe A&E.  No, we tried Lifetime.  That never made it.  A&E is doing some reality programming now.  That's right.  A&E passed.  A&E passed.  Oh, so it's a reality show.  That's right.  So it's a reality show.  So good for you.  Congratulations.  That's great.  What's it called?  Do you have a name pick that? 
[01:41:00]  Huh?  Do you have a name pick that?  Wait, I'm going to write it.  I'm going to send it out on a Twitter.  What is it?  What network is it?  How do you...  Was it at A&E?  What network could it be?  No, it's not A&E.  And it's not a reality show.  My wife hates me.  It's a great name for a reality show.  It is.  Well, I mean...  So it's going to be like a show loosely based on your lives.  It's a show based on the podcast.  Yes.  We're going to film the podcast, right?  Yep.  All right.  We're calling it...  Sort of like a Marin.  Kind of starts with the podcast, ends with it, but a little in between in your life, loosely  based on it.  Gotcha.  I don't know.  That sounds great.  Who's the showrunner for the show? 
[01:41:30]  Who are you going to get to write?  Is it...  Who are you going to get?  Jesse Joyce you're getting?  Or are you going to get Kurt Metzger?  Really?  Yeah, Kurt?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm serious.  I want to hear about...  We drove home from Norton's...  All right, so this is what it is.  All right, so...  No, it's not what it is.  We drove home from Norton's shoot the other day.  Me, Kurt, Bonnie, and Natal.  Fucking...  I love Kurt and Natal because they hate everything we hated in this business.  But the difference between everybody is Kurt mentions names. 
[01:42:00]  He doesn't care.  Like, he just fucking is fucking miserable.  Yeah, Kurt's...  He's really, really funny.  Yeah.  But Kurt's a big kook.  Kurt's a fucking giant-headed maniac.  He's a problem.  If he wasn't a comedian, he would just be biting children in the street.  Play soccer.  Did you see his...  Have you ever seen a picture of his unit?  Yeah, he shows it to everyone.  He's a big dick.  He shows it to everyone.  It's phenomenal.  How big is it, Rich?  How big? 
[01:42:30]  Big enough for me to travel.  He's like the fucking hound on Game of Thrones.  He should have a big dick.  Right, he's...  Fucking 6'8 with a giant skull and big fucking hands and big shoulders.  He's a galoot.  Kurt's a big galoot.  Yeah, but he has no muscle tone.  He's...  Like, if you were...  He'd be...  If you were seven feet tall, you'd be him.  Because, you know...  No, he's a bigger-boned guy.  Kurt's a big-shouldered guy.  Yeah.  He's not in, like, gym washboard abs shape, but Kurt's just a big, strong dude. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, he's one of those guys.  All right.  We don't need a stupid shave stomach.  Oh, God.  When are you going to start tattooing?  It's like an alien body.  When are you going to start tattooing all that?  Yeah.  Do you do anything on the back or anything like that?  Nah.  Why would you put it in places people can't see it?  All right.  Listen, we got someone on the line here.  Snowy in Michigan.  Snowy.  Oh, boy.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hi, Snowy.  It's nice seeing Rich Fletch at 141 IQ after being taken by a phantom comedy club. 
[01:43:30]  Hey, Snowy, Snowy, Snowy in Michigan, if you move to Florida, would you change your name  to Flamingo?  Nope.  No!  What are you doing, Rich?  Good one, Rich.  You're the caller.  That's true.  All right.  Let me say hi to Charlie in Santa Cruz.  Charlie.  Rich Voss and Jim Florentine in the studio today.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Voss. 
[01:44:00]  That sounds like a bictitious story you got going on.  Voss, you're so fascinated the way you told a story.  I'm just sitting here just listening to the radio thinking, how stupid can somebody tell  a story?  It's just so stupid.  But how stupid is it for somebody to stay and listen to it?  Oh, fuck.  Yes, it's okay.  Okay, listen.  I don't think it was a...  I thought he told it all, right?  It was a really good story.  The guy was just a bictitious club owner.  Yeah.  So what's wrong with the fucking story?  He did say bictitious.  Yes, of course he did.  Okay.  What did I say? 
[01:44:30]  Nothing.  It's just like it's hypnotizing the way you talk.  You could put somebody in a room and make it dark and you could just sit there and listen  to you talk and you could go face it outer space the way you talk.  Rich has very good stories.  I think he just needs to edit a little bit.  That was a good...  A little bit.  That was important.  Just a little bit.  That was a good story.  People in New Orleans...  Comics in New Orleans are happy I told that story.  Absolutely.  No one stands up for them.  I don't know.  I think I would have been suspicious a few times during that whole...  No.  That way along with this guy. 
[01:45:00]  What was wrong with the...  You get these...  Yeah.  Nine out of ten times they open.  Shut up.  We're talking now.  We'll get back to you.  Okay?  I had the same thing happen in Buffalo with the guy who runs the Philly Helium.  The club did open.  And when I did the New Year's Eve, they just didn't have the liquor.  And he's an experienced club owner.  He really knows how to run a room.  But up there, there was just like all these things that were out of his control that he  was waiting for.  Red tape bullshit.  Yeah.  So it did open.  But sometimes you don't know, is it going to open on time? 
[01:45:30]  And this is a guy who knows what he's doing.  So some guy that doesn't know what he's doing, I could easily see how he'd get there and  go, what the fuck?  But here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  When you're talking to him, you don't think this guy doesn't know because he's speaking  the language.  Yeah.  He's really...  And he's...  He's saying things like ha-ha and jokes and big laughs for everyone.  It's hilarity.  Jokes don't work for everybody all the time.  He was recommended by somebody who runs...  You said all that.  I know.  I know.  You cut this guy off.  He's starting to get on my nerves.  All right, Charlie.  Thank you. 
[01:46:00]  Bye.  Just cut him off.  Just get rid of him.  All right.  All right.  Well, this guy's even...  He's got something for you.  Randy in Illinois.  We're going to take a different approach here now.  Randy, go ahead.  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, Rich.  You know, if you ever decide to get a tramp stamp, you ought to make a fucking vulture.  I think I just picked your ass clean.  I'm telling you.  What was that?  That's right.  What was that?  You waited on...  Wait.  You waited on line, and not only that, you planned that, and then waited on hold, and  that's what you came out with? 
[01:46:30]  Come on.  Listen.  Go back.  Go ahead.  Listen.  You know, we're going to let you call back in...  We're going to let you call back in five minutes.  We're going to let you call back...  We're going to let you call back in five minutes, all right, you country fuck, and come do it  again.  He had it all planned out in his head, though, Rich.  Yeah, he said, this is the one that's going to send me over the top.  This is the one where I could tell my friends I got them on radio.  Did you hear him get all wordy and stuff?  Fucking horrible.  You're still talking. 
[01:47:00]  You're not stopping.  You're not going to win.  Listen to me.  All right.  Thank you, Randy.  You're not trained at this.  Somebody points out...  I know it was a good lie, Randy.  Somebody tweeted me and said there's a Lucky Comedy Club on Twitter in New Orleans.  There is one, and official Twitter for the Lucky Comedy Club in New Orleans, presenting  the best comedians in the world six nights a week, grand opening May 2014.  Yeah, it just opened in May, and I was there.  It does, you know, let's see when the last...  Well, the last tweet was March 12th. 
[01:47:30]  March 12th.  That's not a good sign for a club opening in May.  And six nights a week for a club first opening is way too many nights.  You probably should have checked their Twitter.  Yeah, I went online looking for their website.  In New Orleans.  You didn't find a website either.  In this day and age, if you're opening up a new business, you've got the website all set.  You're tweeting a lot.  Yeah.  There might have been a website.  There might have been a website.  All right.  Let me say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Sean.  I've got this gig in New Orleans, and the guy's dodging me. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, God.  It's kind of funny.  But it's 15 years old.  He's fucking...  He hung up.  He ran away.  Hold on.  I'm looking at their Twitter.  Sorry, Jim.  I'm looking at their Twitter, and there's a girl named Alicia Wood, who I don't know,  but she's a stand-up.  You know her?  I've heard of her.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think she's good, too.  She wrote on her Twitter, happy Mardi Gras.  I guess she wrote some kind of French thing for Mardi Gras.  I actually wrote a South French.  I don't know if I can.  I booked New Orleans for May 8 through 10 grand opening. 
[01:48:30]  Lucky comedy clubs, so stay tuned.  And they retweeted it, so I'm looking at their Twitter feed.  Yeah.  So I wonder what happened with Alicia Wood, because at least they had, like, Damon for their  grand opening.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy told you that?  Yeah.  He didn't tell you her?  Well, she might have been opening for Damon.  Oh, okay.  I'd love to ask her.  Yeah.  Now I'm obsessed with this story is all I want to talk about.  I'm kind of obsessed, too.  I'm favoriting her tweet.  I'm so happy about it.  I'm just trying to figure out if Rich should have known better.  No, I can see how that happens.  Yeah, because this stuff does happen where clubs get off the ground, and they just, they 
[01:49:00]  keep hitting little roadblocks, but eventually they get it together, and they wind up opening.  Right.  When was your date, though?  Was it June?  It was last week.  Oh, last weekend.  See, that club should have been open for a month.  It was supposed to open in May.  I can know, like, May 15, 16, 22, 23, just to see.  It's like, you know what?  You're right.  With a new club.  Yeah.  We're obsessed with a new club opening to make sure to show what's going on.  Yeah.  Well, we got a guy.  Well, it doesn't matter.  I still would have been out of ticket.  What's the difference?  We got a guy.  Chris in North Carolina.  Go ahead, Chris. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, Rich.  You would think that a fucking FBI profiler would know better than getting off the fucking  gym like this.  That's true.  And you know what it is?  Sometimes we get thrown off the track, you know, as profilers.  Does Florentino know about this?  It's a great callback.  When Rich plays golf, and, you know, you have to have the small talk, because they team  you up with people you don't know, and it gets to, what do you do for a living?  He doesn't want to say he's a comic or anything, because he doesn't want to deal with it. 
[01:50:00]  He just wants to play golf.  So he tells him he's an FBI profiler.  That's great.  They can't ask any more questions.  Oh, they ask a lot.  Of course they do.  You should make it up.  I try to.  I don't get past, you know, that I work in anti-terrorism.  But can't you just tell him, look, I really can't talk about it?  Well, I mean, sometimes it's fun to, you know, one Asian guy was nervous, because he probably  did something wrong.  He goes, you know, he's just like, hey, looking up and looking to me.  I go, why would I?  You know, fucking, I don't know.  Why would I look into you?  Can you imagine, though, hearing he's an FBI profiler, and then talking to him for a 
[01:50:30]  couple minutes, and you're like, wow, he doesn't seem that he's qualified to do that.  Is there any of the terminology?  He's saying words wrong.  I wish you guys could see Norton.  He's acting, because his eyes are squinting and popping.  Yeah, I'm thinking.  So he's doing the scene.  Yeah, I'm doing you.  I'm acting as you acting.  It's you.  It's you.  It's easy to just say you're a landscaper, because then they got nothing.  No one's going to ask what kind of mow you have, what kind of weed eater you use. 
[01:51:00]  Do you guys edge after or before you do the lawn?  That's a fucking great one.  Just say, I got a landscaping business.  Oh, okay.  And then they're done.  I got a county owner in Detroit.  He wants to book you.  Oh, no, he doesn't.  Not if it's Ridley.  Jason.  Yeah, hey, Rich.  I got an abandoned crack house here in Detroit.  I can't send you to the pocket, but if you show up, I can give you some product when you  show up.  That's what you...  God.  These are the worst callers.  I don't think he's a real club owner. 
[01:51:30]  Huh?  He said he wants to give me crack.  They're all trying.  I know.  They're trying really hard to get to you.  The closest one...  The closest one was the FBI profiler.  That was good.  Well, it was because it was a good callback.  Yeah.  You didn't like that guy?  He's got a new club in Detroit.  Yeah.  He's booking me a crack house.  Whoa.  I'm surprised guys aren't calling up congratulating Rich about his TV show so we could jinx him.  The reality show.  There's no reality show.  Based on the podcast.  No, it's loosely based.  Loosely based. 
[01:52:00]  There's nothing going on.  There's a pen house.  Is this the reality or are you guys going to write it?  There's a pen house.  Look, it's already on ONA show.  What?  Apparently Rich Voss has some big things going on.  It's obviously a potential television show.  It's already online.  See?  That could fuck it up.  How does that fuck it up?  Huh?  How does it fuck it up?  It's not fucking up from the network.  The network's not going to go, why were you talking about it?  Why will you know Friday or Monday?  What?  But you think, you really think it's a superstition and it's going to mess it up that we're talking 
[01:52:30]  about it right now.  That's what's going to mess it up.  I didn't say what it was.  I know, but that's what you're saying.  I did tell you about your pen house article.  But that's what you're saying.  No, it's some kind of TV project.  So why would it fuck it up?  The network's not going to be mad that he's talking about it.  He didn't mention the network.  Nothing.  They would be excited.  They would be excited.  They would get some free promo.  It's his gambling background that jinx, don't stand here, don't do this.  Yeah.  You didn't buy your fucking house by gambling. 
[01:53:00]  No one ever has.  You never won.  You were calling people from Vegas every time you worked there.  I'm in town one day.  Send me a hundred bucks.  Everybody lost all of his money or it doesn't work.  Whatever you were doing didn't work.  So fucking change it up.  Superstitious idiots.  Yes, change it up.  Yeah, that is that gambler stuff.  It is.  You've had other TV offers, TV show deals.  None of them came through.  Yeah, see?  Fucking so be positive and try the other way.  Congratulations. 
[01:53:30]  No, but it's not TV.  You're making it.  It is TV.  Maybe it's another offer to make another movie.  No.  Is it?  No.  You're trying to throw us off.  We're not stupid.  The first movie's barely sold.  They're not giving you another movie.  You're not fucking Tom Cruise.  We showed it in four festivals.  No, absolutely.  It's a great movie.  I highly recommend it.  I like the movie a lot.  And we're in it.  Which makes it exciting.  It's not another movie.  No, it's not.  The first one's not even released.  They're not giving you another movie.  It's not another movie.  Rich.  Absolutely not.  We're convinced.  Don't try to throw us off.  Not another movie.  What happens Friday or Monday? 
[01:54:00]  More meetings about this?  Or are they just going to finally decide or what?  You're off.  You're so.  I'll tell you during break what it is.  Why?  Because, you know, it's like, you know what it is?  We're excited for you.  It's like if you were going on a date with a hot girl.  He can't.  He's married.  That's a bad example.  Okay.  All right.  Hypothetically, yeah.  Hypothetically, you're going on a date with a hot girl.  Before that date, would you say, hey, guess who I'm going to sleep with tonight?  Yeah, absolutely.  No, you wouldn't.  I'm like, Jim, look at this picture of this chick I'm going out with. 
[01:54:30]  But he wouldn't say her name on the radio.  No, no.  You just said, hopefully.  Would you say, I'm going to sleep with her tonight?  But I don't know if I'm going to.  It's just the same.  We're saying, what do you think might be happening?  Yeah.  You would say he's going out with her.  I'd still show her the picture.  I'm not going to go.  I'm not going to show you the picture.  Because then maybe she won't.  What kind of creep that's going on this first date already has a picture of the girl?  But everyone does this same age.  I'm online.  Absolutely.  Facebook, Twitter.  Rich, you started this, though.  Yeah.  You were the one that was bragging.  Tell us.  About what?  Is this a picture? 
[01:55:00]  I'll text Bonnie.  I'll text Bonnie right now.  Find out what it is.  I wasn't, how'd you get a number?  I wasn't, uh, I wasn't bragging.  I wasn't bragging.  I was just saying things are going on.  I told you about the penthouse thing.  No, but you had that coy, sexy look on your face that no one could see.  You wanted us to ask you.  No.  You wanted us to ask you about it.  You brought up big things for a reason.  No, exactly.  We would say, whoa, what big thing?  You can't be talking about your dick and your fingers.  It's got to be something.  Can you tell Sam from the Little Rascals sound booth to get me some food? 
[01:55:30]  Remember?  You don't get it?  No, I don't.  Hold on.  We got a guy.  Oh, I hope it's on an improv show.  We got a guy, Rich, who can help you out here.  Dr. Kevorkian, you're on the phone.  David in Georgia.  David.  David, go ahead.  Rich, I know the guy who owns Lucky's, and he's been trying to make this right with everybody. 
[01:56:00]  He's been direct, depositing the money back.  All I need is your bank account and your four-digit security code, and he'll get it right to you.  Oh, God.  That wasn't that bad, actually.  That was pretty good.  He sounded pretty professional.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  That wasn't bad.  Let me give it to you.  Hold on.  What's your number?  I mean, let me text it to you.  That was pretty good.  You got to give it to him, Rich.  Yeah, but it was good.  It was a comedy show.  He's having fun in you.  Let's say hi to Kenny in Dallas.  Kenny.  Hey.  Thanks.  When you're playing golf or something, you ought to just make up something like an aquanaut or something that doesn't even exist. 
[01:56:30]  Just throw something out there, and then be totally quiet about it afterwards.  So you're saying the whole story's made up?  That Rich maybe wanted to get away from...  No, he's going to play golf with people he doesn't know, and they ask him what he does.  Oh, that thing.  There's nothing out there that doesn't even exist.  Lucky's Comedy Club.  Right.  Wait, you think he's lying about telling people he's an FBI profiler? 
[01:57:00]  Oh, I believe that.  He's saying tell people something that doesn't exist, a job that's not even like...  Oh, okay.  His phone's crapping on it.  Probably doesn't even exist.  Yeah.  Yeah, but then if it's something that should make you even more curious, I just...  Yeah, then they're going to ask, what is that?  When people ask me, I go, ah, I'm in marketing, and they don't want to know about marketing,  so then that's the end of the conversation.  I would...  You pick something where people would actually go, wow, really?  I need to know more about this.  You know...  He's kind of right.  You should just come up with something so mundane that no one's going to ask a follow-up 
[01:57:30]  question.  You know what I think that...  Because you guys give us comedy advice, I think you should really only take calls like  one day a week.  No, no, not at all.  Really?  No, I love phone calls.  They're killing today.  Don't you have screeners, though?  They're killing today.  Me and Florentine are loving this.  They're doing really good.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's take another one.  Get someone from fucking New Orleans.  I wish there was a comic in New Orleans listening that would fucking...  I'm saying New Orleans. 
[01:58:00]  What's that?  It's New Orleans.  Whatever.  All right.  Well, we could do this.  We could take a break.  Get some food.  Yes, and some information.  I got food.  And more information.  We're going to get to the bottom of this.  Hold on.  Florentine's in the studio.  Are you doing it unmasked?  Yeah, I'm doing it...  I think I heard a promo for that.  July 9th, I'm doing it at The Stand.  I think it's sold out.  Oh, that's great.  I don't know, but I mean, it's...  That is awesome.  So, yeah, July 9th, 8 o'clock.  You're going to have a great time.  I'm not telling people anything.  What are you saying? 
[01:58:30]  See, Bonnie's yelling at me.  I'm just saying...  He did tell us.  He did tell us.  He told us.  He did say it.  Congratulations, Bonnie.  Congratulations.  I said stuff is going on, and they keep just making it up.  Congratulations.  I didn't tell them one thing, okay?  Tell Bonnie I'm sending her a text right now.  Congratulations.  I didn't tell them one thing, and they're just...  Congratulations.  So what?  They're going, oh, you're doing this and that, and this...  And we're going to tweet it.  And I never once said one thing.  We already tweeted it.  Oh, no, we have more info.  We got the penthouse thing in Montreal.  We're going to tweet what's going on with Voss and Bonnie. 
[01:59:00]  The movie sold, and then they just started going, oh, you got a T.  I didn't say one thing, so don't worry.  Can you put her on speaker?  Wait, hold on.  Why don't you just have her call in?  Can you call her online?  Call, give her the number to call in?  Yeah, call Bonnie, call in.  She knows the number, right?  She doesn't know the number.  Of course she does.  Put her on speaker.  We can yell.  Yeah, hold on.  Hold on.  Let me...  How do you get the speaker?  Hold on.  Wait, hold on.  Hit the red button.  Shut up.  Are you still...  That's why we wanted her to call in, Rich.  This is ridiculous.  She won't be able to hear us. 
[01:59:30]  I know how to work the speaker.  No, you don't.  You're hitting buttons.  All right.  Are you...  Go ahead, Bonnie.  Hello?  Bonnie, congratulations.  Any speech or what, but nothing is going on.  Thank you.  But they won't listen to me because, you know what they are?  They're bullies.  Well, you didn't bring it up.  You brought it up.  I said good things are happening, and you guys twisted it.  Bonnie, he said that big things are happening that I can't talk about.  What is that?  What?  Big things that are happening that I can announce Friday or Monday. 
[02:00:00]  That's exactly what he said.  He says I've got to wait until Friday or Monday.  Or Monday.  Big things.  Good things are happening.  You're right.  Big.  Not good.  Big.  No, I said big things are happening.  Big.  Yeah.  Big.  The movie.  Penthouse.  No, and then you said, after all of that, and big things happen.  No, I meant that is all in one.  No, you didn't.  All right.  Bonnie?  Yeah, no, it's ridiculous.  Who walks around going, but things are happening. 
[02:00:30]  That's why you started this.  You can't just say big things are happening and then not.  Somebody says, well, tell me what it is.  No, no, I can't tell you.  Right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's the first kind of person on the planet.  Thank you.  That's exactly.  Just wait until you can tell.  Let's say something.  Right.  But he thinks if he talks about it, Bonnie, he's going to jinx it, that somehow it's going  to fuck it up.  He did tell us.  He's right.  He shouldn't talk about it.  Why is he saying any good things are happening? 
[02:01:00]  Well, he told us it's a TV show.  No, I didn't.  Yes, you did.  No, I didn't.  He didn't tell us that much.  It's like loosely based on you guys' lies, not a reality show.  Yes.  They made that.  Listen, Bonnie, I swear to God, go listen to the replay.  He told us it's a TV show.  We know that much.  We never listened to this show.  Huh?  In a way.  Not only that, are you leaving?  No.  Bonnie, he tried to mix it up by going, no, it could be another movie that we got. 
[02:01:30]  Right.  But we know it's a TV show, so congratulations.  It's not a TV show.  I never confirmed it.  I never confirmed that.  He winked at us when he said it.  No, I didn't.  Yes, he did.  You didn't even know how to wink.  That's how I know you're lying.  You don't know how to wink?  Not at her.  Fucking quick.  Jesus, that's quick.  That's scary quick.  What happens to his brain?  It's unbelievable.  I didn't say anything, so go back to bed, or you guys go back. 
[02:02:00]  Is Raina up?  Oh, I've got to tell you this thing Raina did.  You'll love it.  But listen, I didn't tell him anything, so there's nothing to worry about.  You're done with the storylines, right?  Can I just give you a little bit of, you know, some verbal advice.  When you're asking a question, you usually wait, like, even just a half a second for the other person to answer.  That's true.  You did just ask and then keep blathering on.  Yeah.  Hey, Bonnie, we're trying to figure out who the showrunner is to the show. 
[02:02:30]  And what now?  And Rich smiled when we mentioned Kurt Metzger, so we're thinking it's Kurt can be the top guy.  We almost have the network, too.  We almost.  We know it's not A&E because he told us it's not A&E.  Yeah, it definitely has an A&E.  That's why we know it's a TV show because we went A&E and he goes, no, it's not A&E.  No, I said, no.  Who would answer?  Oh, my God, Ray.  He said that.  I swear to you.  So we know it's a TV show.  I'm going to say Showtime, but I'm not going to not say it.  Showtime.  Okay?  That's all I'm going to say.  We go, is it A&E?  And he goes, no, it's not A&E. 
[02:03:00]  No, I said, no, when you go, is it A&E?  I go, A&E passed on us.  That's all.  I didn't say any.  No, he said no, and then he said, no, it's not A&E.  And he really wanted us to guess more because he's very excited about this.  No, I'm not excited because I've been in these situations.  No, this was the situation.  You said lifetime.  I'm very excited.  Otherwise, you would be walking around, but things are happening.  You can't say that to your friends and just assume we're just going to let it go.  Yes, and you can't assume we're friends.  Bonnie, he also made this comment. 
[02:03:30]  He said he wakes up in a good mood.  He goes, don't you just wake up in a good mood and enjoy?  Does he ever wake up in a good mood?  No, he did not say that.  Yes, he did.  I swear to God, he said that.  Does he ever?  I said there's no, I've never seen him, barely ever in a good mood.  I've never seen him, I'm not even talking about morning, ever in a good mood.  That time in the post office when you fell and busted your head open.  Remember that?  I'm hilarious.  I'm hilarious.  That was kind of funny. 
[02:04:00]  I've been in a good mood lately.  Yeah, because of this big TV project.  There's no TV project.  Congrats.  It's about time, though.  There's no TV project.  Well, we'll find out Friday or Monday.  It's already all over Twitter, Bonnie.  I know an A show.  It's all over.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Don't blame us, because he was the one who said big things are happening.  That's all I did was say big things.  Montreal, the penthouse thing, nothing, you know?  Nope.  And then you said, we'll find out more Friday or Monday. 
[02:04:30]  No.  Listen, anyhow, listen.  I was talking to our distributor yesterday or two days ago, whatever.  And he goes to them.  He goes, well, you know, big things are happening.  We've got Montreal.  And they don't know what Montreal is.  They just think you're talking about your vacation.  He goes, well, you know, big things are happening in Montreal.  You've got to be exhausting to live with. 
[02:05:00]  She's exhausting.  Good one.  All right.  Well, all right.  Congrats on the TV project.  Yes, good luck.  Can I tell them what you're doing now, though?  Anyway, you guys, come up with the title.  I'll see you later.  All right.  All right.  Can you tell us what she's doing?  Oh, Bonnie, right now?  Hopefully filing for something.  She was offered.  She's doing Letterman?  Huh?  Letterman?  No.  Well, she's supposed to do Letterman, yeah. 
[02:05:30]  They said she's doing it.  That's top secret, too.  Put the set together.  What's that?  Was that top secret, too?  No, no.  She's done Letterman twice already.  I know.  She's doing it again.  That's awesome.  She was offered a job to produce this reality show, you know, to run the show or whatever.  She goes, look, I can't do it.  I've got to do it out of my house.  And they go, no.  And then they just offered her, you know, to write every day from her house, the storylines.  So she could.  For a reality show? 
[02:06:00]  For a different show, yeah.  Yeah, that assisted reality.  For a different, not your show, a different show.  A different show.  You say, yeah, you already got caught up again.  You go, no, a different show.  No, it didn't.  Not your show.  Not the show you guys are going to go.  You just said, no, no, no, a different show.  No, it's another show.  You got caught.  You don't have a show.  You got caught a lot.  We might have to make a famous list.  See, here's the thing, too.  You've gotten caught.  What reality show?  Why don't I tell you what reality show?  I really don't even know.  The one she's writing on.  He told me about that a couple weeks ago that she had rejected to go there because it was just too much time away. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, it's too much, you know.  But here's why I can't say anything on this show.  And you say, like, when you guys made jokes about, you know, our fire and, you know, you guys, oh, you guys started this or did that.  You know, first of all, I was in California.  We're only getting sued by three or four fucking insurance companies now.  And they'll probably play tapes from this show.  Who cares?  But they know we don't know.  They know that we have no knowledge of the incident. 
[02:07:00]  Put us on the stand.  We're just dumb comedians.  Fuck.  What do we know?  They know we're not knowledgeable insiders that we're just joking.  They're fools out of themselves using this audio.  We're just saying that you're a boob and that if it was a cool cigarette, you know, she was fucking a black guy.  That's all.  I begged them to put me on the stand so I could tell them all the stuff you actually told me behind the scenes from that whole thing.  Are you fucking stupid?  I mean, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, that whole thing about we're looking for a reason to move. 
[02:07:30]  I just didn't know what that was.  And the thing is.  We can't pay our bills.  And we might have to do a thing or two.  Hold on.  Snitch has something.  Can you say snitch?  That was a real.  Say tattletale.  Snitch.  I know.  Tattletale is better for you.  All right.  We're going to play the clip of Voss saying big things from earlier.  Here it is.  A mover and a shaker there.  Okay.  Penthouse article.  New CD.  It's other bigger things.  Isn't that fucking insane? 
[02:08:00]  Other bigger things.  Other bigger things.  Isn't that fucking insane?  You said that.  Isn't that crazy?  Things finally happening.  Other bigger things.  Yeah.  That's a TV show.  It's a divorce.  If you've got a movie sold, a seven-page spread in Penthouse, and he says other bigger things,  it's got to be huge.  Yeah.  TV show.  It's not going to be like another podcast.  You're joining a different podcast network.  I would never leave Riot Cash.  Right.  I'm just saying.  But it's not a contract.  So it's going to be huge.  And it's past the pilot stage. 
[02:08:30]  No.  No.  Are you still going to make it?  All right.  Now we know.  There's no TV show.  So it's going to be a pilot.  They're going to shoot a pilot probably for Showtime.  So they've asked for a pilot.  Okay.  All right.  You guys can guess all you want.  I'm just saying.  How about the one that went, no, no.  No, no.  You're getting along again.  No, no.  See, we're not that tall.  I wish I would have shot.  If I shot a pilot, you would have known I shot a pilot.  Are you going to get a little money up front? 
[02:09:00]  If you shot a pilot, that's in the trades.  You know no meant that you haven't shot the pilot yet.  It's pretty obvious.  No.  Any time you shoot a pilot, it's in the trades.  All right.  Congratulations.  So you're shooting a pilot.  That's pretty cool.  No.  No.  Nothing's bought yet.  Right.  So there's no show.  So you're going to shoot a pilot.  No.  And then they're going to decide if they like it or not.  There's no offer for a pilot.  There's no offer for a pilot.  I'm telling you that.  All right.  Maybe.  Why are your eyebrows going up?  Maybe it's not a pilot.  Maybe it's just going to go.  They're going to do guaranteed six episodes. 
[02:09:30]  Right.  Then I would tell you.  You know what?  I think it's maybe IFC.  No.  Could be that.  Oh, or Sundance.  One of those channels where they might go, hey, we could use the couple like this.  Yeah.  Maybe the Kardashians like them.  Maybe Kim Kardashian heard the podcast.  I said, there's something with these two.  Let's make them the next big item.  Is it the E-Network?  There's no network.  There's no podcast.  I'm fucking starving.  Let's take a break.  I'm Anthony now.  Hey, listen.  We're going to take a break.  No.  We're going to wear you down.  Exactly. 
[02:10:00]  You've slipped up three different times.  We really have.  All right.  We got.  What are you promoting?  The Boston gig that you don't know much about either?  Laugh Boston.  Tonight.  But you don't know where the hotel is or anything?  And July 8th, the Penthouse article.  And then 141 IQ coming out soon.  And bigger things.  The movie.  I'm tired of talking about this dumb fucking.  My manager the other day, Bonnie mentioned a movie.  He said, uh. 
[02:10:30]  Relax.  Shake it.  I didn't care about the bread part.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know where to draw the line.  I pick and choose.  My interest in your sandwich.  We got the story?  I know I just threw it out there.  But whatever.  But someone got in trouble for that now.  It's unbelievable.  The KFC story still continues.  The little girl they got kicked out supposedly.  Oh, it breaks my heart.  KFC confirms that no one ever asked girl to leave restaurant just hours after family released a statement sticking to their story. 
[02:11:00]  So you heard this one, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but they're still giving the $30,000.  They have to.  They have no choice.  They look like assholes.  I mean, it's a little girl that is really fucked up.  You know what?  Maybe KFC did it for their publicity.  Huh?  Maybe they started the story.  I mean, it's making KFC look pretty good.  That they're giving the $30,000.  No matter what, right?  You know, which is nice of it.  Oh, here's the.  Oh, it's Michelle Obama?  Got in trouble for this?  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  All right.  So what is the story?  Wow.  Wow.  Moments ago, ABC News published their coverage of today's White House Summit on working families  during the event Michelle Obama used a racial slur.  That's right.  This slipped past the writer.  What's he talking about, her husband?  Pat yourself on the back, please.  That was a good one.  Pat yourself on the back. 
[02:12:00]  Keep going.  She slipped past the writer and editors at ABC.  Who made no reference to her usage of the word.  Right.  First Lady Michelle Obama admitted to a few of her own struggles as a working mother  while making the case for flexible workplace policies for families.  This is Michelle Obama's quote.  Okay.  The first thing I tried to do, which was a mistake, was that I tried to, I tried the  part-time thing.  I realized I was getting gypped on that front.  Oh, I can't even hear anymore. 
[02:12:30]  What the fuck is wrong with that?  She told Robin Roberts.  So racist.  We all know, there's no hate in your heart when you say that for a group.  Yeah, I don't know.  That's just.  Or an individual.  Remember when fucking Ben Stein hung up on Anthony?  That's as he should have.  Chew him down.  We did say Chew him down.  I thought you said Jew.  Fuck Ben Stein.  I know.  Well, that's what the article says later.  He's a man, pussy.  It stinks.  It says later, for comparison, imagine if Michelle had claimed she was getting Jew down or had 
[02:13:00]  referred to as an Indian giver.  How the fuck did you do that?  That's awful.  Chip bears the same strand of.  Well, really, it does.  Where does Indian giver come from?  Not trusting in Indian people.  Oh, that's not where it came from.  Indian.  Not Indian people, but Indians.  Yeah.  Indian giver.  Where did it come from?  They would give you, like, something and then scalp you. 
[02:13:30]  Why would they give it to you first?  Why wouldn't they just scalp you?  They'd lure you in.  Come here.  You want this?  Because they wanted that scalp.  You want this?  What if they said no?  They didn't want it.  Then they would say, you're sure.  Fucking rich.  Jesus.  Sure.  So now we can't.  All right, I'll take it.  So now we can't say, uh, gypped. 
[02:14:00]  Wow.  Are you fucking kidding?  You think I'm going to eat that ketchup?  Are you crazy?  You had to buy ketchup?  Get me sealed packages.  You think?  Who?  Forget it.  Yeah, I just use it.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Are you out of your mind?  I use that.  What do you think happened to that ketchup?  A bottle of ketchup came in that handful.  Yeah.  And he won't use it.  What do you think happened to that ketchup?  Anything could have happened.  You think somebody came in that ketchup?  No, they didn't use it.  No, leave it here.  Leave it here.  What's wrong with the ketchup?  It's in the garbage.  What do you think is going to happen? 
[02:14:30]  That's all ketchup.  Are you kidding me?  Would you use it?  Yeah.  I wouldn't even care.  I wouldn't even think twice.  Yeah.  Really?  Well, first of all, I'm not nine years old.  I don't use ketchup anymore.  Okay.  Go.  Why wouldn't you use it?  You don't have ketchup?  Yeah.  My son likes ketchup.  Wait.  You really are not a ketchup fan?  No, I don't know.  Well, who?  For what?  Who's mad at ketchup?  I'm not mad at ketchup.  Hold on, hold on.  What do you put on hamburgers then?  Nothing.  Nothing?  Some cheese.  Slice of tomato?  Some cheese. 
[02:15:00]  Slice of tomato maybe?  Come on.  You don't use a little ketchup on a burger?  No, no tomatoes.  No.  I love ketchup on a burger.  Because you're not nine?  That's just me.  Yeah, I'm not nine.  Ketchup is for kids.  What do you put on fries?  Yeah, what do you put on fries?  I don't eat fries.  If you had to eat them.  I don't put an easy ketchup.  Say an Indian said, come into my tent, I have fries.  Wait, wait.  Why don't you eat fries?  I'm not a big fry guy.  If I do, I don't use ketchup on them.  Why are you angry over ketchup?  I'm angry because you won't take it out of there.  What do you think happened to that?  Anything could have.  Okay, like what?  Give me an example.  We all used that ketchup. 
[02:15:30]  Norton could have bled in it.  He didn't.  Yeah, because Norton's going to bleed and then open the top and put blood in it.  That's my politics is a speck.  Okay, and what else?  Okay, one of these disgruntled fucking interns that got fired or abused, okay, or taken advantage  of, said, you know what?  Fuck these people.  And dropped a hit of acid in it.  A hit of acid.  Acid hasn't been around since 1976.  Right, exactly.  Where are they going to find that?  They're putting their penis head on the top.  You had to go with acid? 
[02:16:00]  They put acid in the ketchup.  I know.  No one's ever done that.  No, I've never seen a story where a guy freaking went on an acid trip because we had French fries  with ketchup.  This is where you're wrong.  We were in a diner one night and my friend was pouring out ketchup on his fries.  Right.  And a fucking fly came out.  So somebody put a fly in the ketchup.  No, no.  No, the fly walked in.  He didn't put it in.  The bottle was open and the fly went in and got stuck in the ketchup.  Yeah, killed himself.  Yes, that's what happened.  This is almost like a fucking riddle.  No, someone put it in that didn't.  Okay, so something that happened when you were 17 in a diner, you can't get over. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, why are you so paranoid over ketchup?  I'm paranoid over anything that's open.  Why?  Where does that come from?  No CD tendencies?  No, it's just...  You would eat a strange chick's box 10 minutes after you met her on the side of a dumpster.  That was a bit I used to do.  You're right.  I used to do that bit.  Right, but so why would you do that?  Isn't that worse?  You don't know where that's been.  She might have fucked a guy 10 minutes before.  Better yet.  Exactly.  Or the guy...  Not as good as five minutes before. 
[02:17:00]  There's still a little freshness to it.  But or the guy before, you could have put some acid in there.  Yeah, on the head of his cock.  Right.  And you were making out with girls.  Who knows what they had in their mouth right before that?  You don't know?  You had no problem with that either.  Open mouth.  He knows what was in their mouth right before.  He was sharing it with them.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Can we find out where Indian Giver comes from?  So now we can't say...  We can't say gypped.  From his one.  I want to know if it's this whole come here thing. 
[02:17:30]  Come here.  Where's your gum, Rich?  What?  Where's your gum?  What do you mean my gum?  Your nicotine gum.  I don't have any in my mouth now.  Oh, you don't.  Okay.  I can't.  I usually do when I eat.  I put it up here.  Oh, he's pointing to his...  Under his nose.  How many years on the nicotine are we up to?  Ten now.  Ten years?  Ten years.  Why don't you be positive?  Why don't you be positive?  I'm just asking.  How about how many years off of cigarettes?  How about that way?  Let's go that route.  I'm glad you're off cigarettes because that affected me personally. 
[02:18:00]  When we shared the room and you were falling asleep smoking.  Yeah.  I'll tell that story every time you come in.  No problem.  There's Rich.  Rich out cold with that long ash just waiting to hit the rug and set the place on fire.  It is a miracle you arrived.  And it is.  And a tragedy.  It is also stupid that we were sharing a room.  I know.  Why don't you guys just fucking skin flints?  Get two rooms.  Because he got a deal at the Doral.  Yeah.  Through his friend.  Through my buddy. 
[02:18:30]  So we shared a room.  He didn't step outside to smoke?  No.  I'm convinced at the time he was smoking actually in his house.  Are you off for ten years cigarettes, man?  Wow.  Good for you.  Ten years now.  Alright, Indian giver.  Fuck.  Indian giver.  It was, uh, they said Indians used to do it.  Uh, Lewis and Clark said that, uh, when trading with Native Americans, they had, uh, a very  unusual aspect.  Any trade once consummated was considered a fair trade. 
[02:19:00]  If on one day they traded beads for a dog from a tribe, then days later the tribe could  be, the trade could be reversed.  Upon surrendering the beads, the tribe expected the dog back.  Well, where'd a kite come from?  So what's wrong with that?  I'm looking at it.  What's wrong with saying Indian giver then?  Gooseboro.  It's like, alright, I want my stuff back and you get your stuff back.  That's what that sounds like.  Yeah, but it's a negative thing.  Because you're not like, yeah, hey, I'm an Indian giver. 
[02:19:30]  You go, aw, don't be an Indian giver.  But maybe you decide you don't need that, those stupid beads.  Yeah, but still, to call somebody an Indian giver is a bad thing.  No, it's not.  Like you're not going to get your shit back.  Right.  Don't be an Indian giver, dude.  Don't be an Indian giver, give my stuff back.  Right, you never say like, hey, would you mind being an Indian giver so we could just  trade?  I don't know.  You don't think it's a compliment?  No.  That's a commercial on TV.  What?  And you've seen this commercial.  Wait a second.  We're talking about this crazy flu.  Okay, good, good.  It was for one of these insurance companies or whatever.  And the lady says, the lady says, I don't like to try new things. 
[02:20:00]  And they go, why?  And she has a flashback.  She has a vacuum on the floor and goes and kills the cat.  Then her dog drinks water out of a thing and the current goes up on fire.  And you know the commercial?  No.  Oh, no.  Well, they took the part out where the vacuum goes after the cat.  That's good.  Why?  Because I guess animal right activists went after him for it.  Well, yeah, that's hurtful.  That's what I'm guessing. 
[02:20:30]  I'm just saying we're, as a society, we're crumbling.  How are you guys going to do a TV show with all this shit going on?  Yeah, that's true.  How are you going to be edgy?  That's true.  That would be a good first episode of Ketchup Bottle.  Yeah.  Boy just brings over a Ketchup Bottle.  You can call it the Ketchup Bottle episode.  And he's freaking out.  He's like, we don't have packages, sir.  No one buys acid.  No one has bought acid since 1977.  When they saw Pink Floyd, when Dark Side of the Moon came out.  We can't promise you that no one licked it. 
[02:21:00]  But there's not a fly in here either.  But we can promise no flies and no acid.  And then you did.  Can you eat off a salad bar in New York?  Yes.  An open salad bar.  Yes.  You would.  Yes.  I would and I have.  Well, you guys are better people than me.  Sneeze guard.  You can say that to any people.  For any reason.  You can even say that to ISIS.  They would have been better with Ketchup. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, it would have been better with Ketchup.  Way better with Ketchup.  You take vitamins?  I'm supposed to take them on a full stomach.  What are you doing?  I'm taking my vitamins.  Why do you wrap them up like that?  They just did a huge thing that those dumb daily vitamin doses do nothing.  Yeah, but that was from the pharmaceutical companies who don't want you to take a vitamin.  They don't want you to take a vitamin.  They want you to get sick.  Well, they want you to get sick.  Then you get their pills.  No, they don't.  No.  No.  They really want you to get sick and then you buy their pills.  I read that too. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, it was all bullshit.  Rich Voss.  Okay.  How do you wrap them up every morning?  No, I have them in my pill box, but this is just for today.  You're at that age where you have a pill box?  Well, I got seven days.  I put them in for seven days because I go on the road and I want my pills for seven days.  Who pills are you taking?  This one is a multivitamin.  This one is for your joints.  This one is ginkgo biloba for your mind.  Well, that one you could throw away.  Yeah, you guys would obviously. 
[02:22:30]  This one is bear aspirin, baby bear for your heart.  Right.  And this one is probiotic.  Okay.  Oh.  Please choke.  He just violently threw them into his mouth.  Yeah, I know.  And with coffee.  Coffee vitamins.  Right.  Well, there is not a lot to talk about today when they attack your vitamin talk.  No.  We're fascinated by all of this stuff. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, we're not attacking you.  Yeah.  You wrapped them up, though, all nice.  Yeah.  Because you didn't have your pill box today.  I have stuff hidden in wraps.  All over the place.  Like in the rich.  No Cialis in there or Viagra?  I got Viagra.  I got Viagra.  You don't take the daily stuff?  No.  Why?  For once a week?  Every two weeks?  Every two weeks?  What?  Sex?  Yeah.  Like every...  Whatever.  Whatever.  Really?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Like twice a month? 
[02:23:30]  If that.  Sometimes.  Sometimes we'll look at each other and want to and then go, let's watch TV.  Have a snack.  It lasts longer.  How many times do you have sex a week?  Probably three.  Yeah.  Three, I'd say.  Yeah.  But not four.  How old are you married now?  A year and a half.  Almost three years.  What's your answer?  I married ten years.  Hold on.  This guy wants to take a shot at Florentine.  Martin in Toronto.  Go ahead, Martin.  Hey, Florentine.  You're too old for ketchup.  Too old for chocolate. 
[02:24:00]  But you're not too old to listen to shitty metal music?  Oh, shit.  What shitty metal music?  All of it.  Punching out.  No.  Yeah, see, he didn't.  See, that's not good.  Punching out.  So he's going to say Metallica shitty.  Right.  You got to back up your argument there, sir.  Yeah, he got out.  He didn't know.  He didn't know what shitty metal music I listened to.  Don't call him with cruel accusations.  Were you a metal fan before your show?  Was that your main music?  No, he was never a metal fan.  Was that your main music?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  For years, yeah. 
[02:24:30]  I was a little kid.  Of course.  And you loved Dan Marino.  It's too late.  I'm done.  Thank you, though.  You can just bring him home with you.  Oh, thank God.  Yes.  Do you think that's weird?  Do you think that's weird that he won't?  His ketchup problem?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's weird.  You do?  Of course.  Like, if you went on a date with a guy, wouldn't you, like, he would say it at the table.  You're like, that's kind of weird.  Yeah, if I was out on a date and someone requested, like, a fresh ketchup bottle, I'd be like,  what's the big deal, man?  What other weird things have you got going on?  How old am I?  Yeah.  22. 
[02:25:00]  Are you an intern?  Yes.  All right.  Don't get snippy.  I'm not getting snippy.  She's just answering your question.  But if he said, he said, someone might have put acid in here, what would you say?  I'd say you might be a little out of your mind.  Have you ever gone out with a black eye?  No.  Okay.  What does that have to do?  Has a black eye put acid in your ketchup?  What I'm saying is, are you a racist?  No, I don't think so.  Okay, well.  I like the fact she's not sure yet.  The jury's still out.  Yeah, exactly.  We'll see.  We'll see. 
[02:25:30]  What school are you going to go to?  William Patterson, New Jersey.  William Patterson University of New Jersey.  Wait, will you act like there's William Patterson's all over the country?  It's in New Jersey.  We know that.  Oh, okay.  My daughter's interning, and we had to pay, I had to pay her school $1,500 for her to  intern.  That's fair.  I'm paying to be here.  You're paying to be here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, everybody is.  What do you mean you're paying?  I have to pay for the credit in order to be here.  I have to pay for my transportation.  I have to pay to be here for you lovely men.  Just to get coffee and blueberries. 
[02:26:00]  What do you want to do when you get out of school?  Oh, I want to work in radio.  I want to do stuff like this.  But I want to be them, though.  No, you don't.  No, you really don't want to be us.  But by the time you get out of school, there probably won't be radio ever anymore.  I'm going to be out of school this time next year.  Podcast.  Start a podcast.  I could do that.  Okay.  You got a boyfriend?  She certainly has confidence.  Yeah, I like that.  She's got a lot of confidence.  She seems like the type that could do radio.  She seems like a new, like, 2014 Sue Kalinske or something, you know. 
[02:26:30]  A Sue Kalinske reference.  Jesus.  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  Okay.  I know.  We worked with Sue Kalinske at N.E.W.  That's like fucking 15 years ago.  Sorry, Matt.  Who was she doing radio with?  I forgot.  I don't know.  Who was she?  No, it doesn't matter.  Someone figured it out.  Anyway.  But Florentine, you don't like chocolate either?  No.  I'm not a big chocolate guy, no. 
[02:27:00]  Dark chocolate?  No.  Sea salt?  You didn't have to leave, by the way.  Do you want me to stay?  What do you want me to do?  Well, now it's awkward.  But you didn't have to leave is what I'm saying.  We weren't kicking you.  She's nice.  She's nice.  Let's go.  Do you like, uh, will you eat white chocolate?  The white stuff?  When did you stop eating chocolate?  Matt's, I was never a sweet tooth guy.  No.  Cakes.  Are you kidding me?  You wouldn't, like, love for me. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, ketchup is for nine dollars.  Definitely not pie.  Apple pie.  Key lime pie.  Now, our wife's parents make that all the time.  Apple pie is the best thing ever.  Apple pie is amazing.  Don't get too crazy with it, though.  Don't get too fancy.  Apple crumb, I'll accept.  That's all right.  Do you know what's the fucking best?  What?  Bread pudding.  Ugh.  It is pretty good, but...  What is it again?  I don't know.  Ah, fuck it.  The fucking nana hour we're doing.  It's what you like. 
[02:28:00]  It's...  What is bread pudding?  You won't eat the bread on your meal, but you eat a muffin.  I'm not going to eat the whole thing.  I just took a bite the whole meal off.  Yeah, but you were the one that bragged that you threw half the bread away because, you know,  that's healthier.  I can't bite the muffin.  That muffin will last me three weeks.  What kind of muffin?  You're one of those.  No.  That's a...  No, I'll take it out.  You know who does that?  Who?  What people.  What does it?  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  They save their muffins. 
[02:28:30]  They save their muffins.  Sorry, Tim.  I didn't mean to...  No, no.  You're right.  What?  I don't like the...  I don't like the stereotype.  All right.  We're going to break and regroup here, certainly.  Oh, fuck.  Time flies.  We're doing good.  Boston's going to be in Boston this week at a comedy club.  He doesn't really know where it is.  I just said Summer Street.  Laugh, Boston.  Summer Street.  Okay.  That's good.  It's called Laugh, Boston?  Yeah, it's beautiful.  I'm not lying.  This is a fucking nice place.  Can we look it up online?  I want to see what this looks like. 
[02:29:00]  Nice place.  Are they just opening?  That's cool.  They've been open for a while.  And then Florentine's got a lot going on.  Florentine's going to be doing it unmasked with Ron Bankson.  That's great.  July 9th at the stand.  But I think that might be sold out.  They sell fast, those things.  But I don't know how you would get tickets for that.  They were tweeting it yesterday.  Okay.  So that's great.  Unmasked thing.  Congrats, man.  And then July 9th, the tickets go on set off my one-hour comedy special to George Street  Playhouse in New Brunswick on September 13th.  I'm shooting it.  Nice.  July 9th tickets.  And now July 14th, I'm at Zaney's in Nashville. 
[02:29:30]  Very cool.  Jim Florentine and Rich Voss in studio today.  Just killing it.  Absolutely killing it.  What are you doing?  I got to go to the gym right after this.  I changed.  You changed it to your gym clothes?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I can go right to the gym.  I don't have time to change it.  I don't have time to change it.  What kind of appointment do you have at the gym?  For a personal trainer?  Yeah.  Hey, Rich, you into soccer? 
[02:30:00]  You going to watch the big game today?  Yeah, for my cars.  I'm driving to Boston.  I'm going to pull over.  You can't watch it in your car.  You can listen to it.  They probably have the games on at...  Those old Mercedes don't have TVs in their cars?  That's a new BMW.  I just bought Bonnie one.  Ooh, celebrating that new TV?  Wow, I see you're celebrating early.  You're already buying cars.  Wow, a lot of confidence in this project.  That's got to be like a network.  If you're buying BMWs, that's not cable.  You've got to think NBC, CBS, ABC type of thing. 
[02:30:30]  What year are you up to with your cars?  I just got Bonnie a 2011.  You're getting closer.  That's good for you.  Mine's still a 2010, but it's still a...  When did you get your 2010, though?  Uh, a year and a half, a year ago?  2012.  Yeah, but it was, you know...  Are you ever going to buy a brand new car?  No, it's not worth it to buy a brand new car.  This guy won't use a ketchup bottle, but he'll drive in someone else's car.  You're basically driving someone else's car. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, someone that probably, yeah, picked boogers and wiped them under the seat.  No, because I've licked every area of the car.  What'd you say?  I've licked every area.  Just blew loads all over them.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Well, you know, he jumped off while he was driving.  He had his pants all the way down, so his ass crack was rubbing on the seat.  Sure.  And you've got no problem sitting in that.  Not at all, because you know why?  They disinfect the car, and he...  How do you know they do?  Because it's certified.  It's certified.  I buy real cars.  I don't buy Kias. 
[02:31:30]  But you would just...  I like those Kias.  If you were the guy, though, you would just check, yeah, it's certified.  This was certified.  It doesn't mean they actually do the work.  You don't know what they clean it with.  The guy's cough, and he might have this wine flow.  Right, exactly.  Pertussis, you don't know, and you're going to sit in that.  What the fuck is pertussis?  You don't want to know.  Is that a new disease?  Yeah.  It's a bad one.  It just came out a week ago.  Anthony was the first one to get it.  What, are you going to say something mean to me?  No, you look good. 
[02:32:00]  What were you going to say?  I was going to say, he said he went to go get ready for the gym.  Right.  All he did was put on a fucking coat.  You still had the same outfit on that you had.  What do you have on that?  Sweatpants.  Let me see.  Why don't you look?  Why do I have to get up?  Fucking asshole.  Look at those fucking sweatpants.  Let me see.  I should jump up for you.  How about you turn around and just get up and see for yourself.  What, you don't like his sweatpants?  Look how old.  Fucking horrible. 
[02:32:30]  These are actually not that old, but I do.  You look like my mother in the nursing home.  What, do I have a black dick in my mouth?  I say the nursing home, not your home.  Oh, wow.  That was too much.  My home is off limits.  You got fucking champions.  Yes.  You know, I'll tell you why.  Shut up, because you're a cheap fucker.  No, it's not cheap.  I happen to be...  Who do you go clothes shopping with, Daryl Hammond?  No, I happen to be very generous, and I say that to all the girls I ride on Craigslist. 
[02:33:00]  No, I'll tell you why.  Because these have the bottoms, because I'm short, so these have the bottoms that cling to your leg a little bit.  The ones that are just hang sweats are too fucking big for me.  You got to be 6'4".  No.  Yes, you do.  We're the same size.  I get cool fucking sweatpants.  No, you don't get cool sweatpants.  I got a fucking pair of nice Nike sweatpants.  Hey.  You're cool.  There's P's on the side.  Hey.  Just join the gym and walks around with a fucking trainer.  Like, I got to... 
[02:33:30]  You know what?  Just a week makeover show with you.  All right, listen.  We're moving on.  Michael in Wyoming.  Michael.  Hello, sweatpants.  Morning, boys.  Put your headphones on.  This one's for you.  Leave it to Voss to screw up a simple instruction like take one tablet daily.  Good to see that dinko's working out for you there, Rich.  I mean, good memory.  He roams through airports with the pillbox going, what day is it?  What day is it?  I don't know what pill to take.  For God's sakes, Voss. 
[02:34:00]  Well, that was good.  You know what?  That was almost like...  That was a good one.  I'm telling you, that guy worked on that one.  You got to admit, that was a good one.  He's safe.  He practiced that one in front of the mirror.  I'm telling you, that one...  That was good, right?  I'm telling you, I'm going to try to get him to...  You really hate...  You're thinking about your horrible sweatpants.  Yes.  Obsessing.  Fucking...  They show off a little calf and ankle?  Yeah.  Oh, that's what you want to...  Those white, bright calves you want people to see?  They don't know if those are socks or your fucking skin.  Oh, very nice calves. 
[02:34:30]  Ankle socks?  Fuck, yeah.  Let's say hi to Ryan.  I like ankle socks.  I'm doing those abs.  I don't like ankle socks.  I like that fucking dick bulge and you...  The ankles show.  Girls love it.  Let's go to Ryan in Minnesota.  Ryan.  Hey, Voss.  I like to hear that you changed your tune as far as the way you search for cars.  Five years ain't too bad to be driving, you know, something that old.  But I remember...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's five years old?  What's five years old?  It's only two years old.  He got it...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, I see.  Your vehicle's now five years old. 
[02:35:00]  You used to shop on eBay for cars?  I remember you would get like a little caddy or a road...  What's wrong with these people?  Can't they let go of 15 years going?  Yeah, man.  He's just saying...  They're not over the ketchup thing.  They don't understand the ketchup thing.  Get a good caller, please.  I can't understand.  These are terrific calls.  These are as good as we've had in months.  These are the fucking worst calls I've ever...  There's not much to compare them against us.  They're terrific calls.  They're just not over the ketchup thing.  They don't understand why you wouldn't use our ketchup.  That's our show's ketchup.  We all use it. 
[02:35:30]  You don't use it.  I don't really...  I don't like ketchup.  I'm not...  Oh, no.  I'm not...  What do you mean?  No, I'm kidding.  You don't like ketchup?  I like ketchup.  I do like ketchup.  I like ketchup.  You know what's good on a hamburger or a turkey burger?  What?  Ketchup and a little cold...  Oh, let me go to Pinterest.  What's that?  That's where the chicks go when they have some fun thing to say.  Do you know...  You don't know Pinterest?  No.  All I know is my wife, your wife, and a bunch of other girls are on a group tweet or a group  instant message. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  They love writing each other all day long.  Oh, those group messages.  They make each other laugh.  Your wife is funny.  I know.  She should be doing this.  She's fucking funny.  What are you doing?  Looking up where to get sweatpants on the way to the gym.  I'm going to go to Nike with you.  Rich.  No.  Rich.  I want cool sweatpants.  Just relax.  I'm very...  What?  I'm very relaxed.  You're not relaxed.  You turned around.  What are you doing?  He's just on his phone for a second. 
[02:36:30]  Everything's okay.  I'm right here with you.  I'm hearing everything you're saying.  Right.  All right.  You said the guy practiced the call in front of the mirror.  His wife's very funny.  They're on a group text together.  Right.  I'm with you.  Mm-hmm.  Let's see.  Mm-hmm.  How much that goes?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  We got a good call for you, Rich.  This one's a good one.  I'll be honest with you.  This one's going to be all right.  All right.  Let's go.  Who is this?  It's Derek in Georgia.  Go ahead.  Good morning, guys.  How you doing?  Good morning.  All right.  What part of Georgia?  Very south, just north of the Florida line. 
[02:37:00]  Don't you know what city you live in, stupid?  Oh, look at that.  He's sweet to me.  Yeah.  Val d'Osta, right north of the Florida line.  Yeah.  You told us that already.  Move on.  Yeah.  He's going to be nice to you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought it was...  God.  I picked a good one for you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought it was my cousin.  Go ahead.  Hey, how can 10 years of marriage ruin your sex life?  I mean, is it medical or psychological?  No, it's not ruined. 
[02:37:30]  I mean, you know what it is?  That's a good question.  Is it medical?  Can't get boners?  I can get boners.  I can get boners.  Yeah, I can get boners.  Do you get a nice turgid one without a pill?  No.  Sometimes when I jerk off, I can't get hard.  Right.  Like I'm jerking off forever, and it's still like semi-soft and hard.  Yeah.  And like I'll cum when it's soft, and I'll go, this is awesome.  It's not even a good cum because it's not really hard.  I've done that, too.  It's just humiliating.  It's so horrible.  You're bullying your dick.  It's fucking just...  It's the fucking worst.  Yeah, it's usually like on the second or third one of the day. 
[02:38:00]  It's not horny.  My cock is horrendous.  I ran out of things to think about.  Like there's nothing left when you're jerking off to think about it.  You don't think about your wife when you're doing that?  Is she ever in the mix?  Yes, yeah, but not alone.  Yeah, but you chose her to spend the rest of your life with.  I mean, we have 22 years, and we're still two to three times a week.  Yeah, but look where you live.  What else do you got to do?  Ride my motorcycle, go fishing, and shoot my guns at the range. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, that's pretty good.  Yeah, that's a good life.  That's pretty good.  What kind of fishing?  Catfishing, mostly.  That's so funny.  Bottom dwellers.  That's so funny.  You don't do that.  This is probably a hack question, because I don't know, whatever.  But do you do any of that noodling?  Oh, hell no.  I don't stick my hands where I can't see.  That's what real men do.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  No, I'm not making funny.  I'm just saying in general that fuck that.  What's that?  Grabbing, bitch?  You're right, fuck that.  Grabbing.  Where you go in what? 
[02:39:00]  Like the swamps and the rivers?  I don't even know where the fuck.  My cousin lives in a swamp in Louisiana, and they do that shit for all you.  Dude, imagine going in a...  ...alligator at night.  Fuck that.  Have you ever seen a noodling video?  That's when they grab them?  No.  No.  No.  You have to put your whole arm in where they're hanging out, and then they bite your whole  arm.  That's how you get them out.  Yeah, that was on that fucking TV show.  You don't really grab them.  You wait for them to pretty much grab onto you.  I couldn't do that.  Do you not even let my wife grab me? 
[02:39:30]  I'm not going to let a fucking strange fish.  You know what I mean?  Fuck that.  That's creepy.  That is crazy.  That's fucking creepy.  Give me a poll.  You got to know the fish first.  Had a drink, dinner, something like that.  What'd you say?  Well, you said a strange fish.  What if you had drink and a dinner, you know, get to know the fish?  Your phone crapped out a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I get it.  Like, if I knew the fish.  Or wreck our business.  Now, you're married how many years, and you're still having sex?  22 years.  We hit 22 years this year.  It's still two to three times a week.  For real? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, honest.  I'm not trying to fuck with you.  Any pills in the mix?  No.  Not to do it.  I do it on the side just to play like Jimmy does.  How old is your wife?  She is 41.  41?  And how old are you?  46.  She'll be 57 Monday.  So 11 years.  You'll see in 11 years.  Monday's your birthday?  Your birthday's right around the corner?  No, it's Monday.  Howdy.  Oh, is that when you're going to make a big announcement?  No.  On your birthday.  Oh, the birthday boy has an announcement, doesn't he? 
[02:40:30]  Yay!  Yay!  Birthday, boy!  That's why he's saving it for Monday.  Do we have to put birthday hats on for the announcement?  I'll eat cake then.  When he gets his TV show, I'll eat cake.  I'll have fucking ketchup.  Wait, not even birthday cake?  I'll eat birthday cake.  What about when your son has a birthday?  Maybe a little ice cream cake.  Ice cream cake's good.  With the regular cakes.  I love this.  So you're going to announce it on Monday?  Now we'll see now it works.  Yeah, birthday boy. 
[02:41:00]  I didn't even realize my birthday was Monday.  On his 57th birthday.  You just said it.  I mean, it didn't hit me until now when he said he was 56, 46.  I don't need to play it out.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Is sex...  I don't know.  Yeah, but Bonnie's in her prime right now because she's younger than you.  She's in her prime.  She is.  Why that horrible look on your face?  She wants to be in her prime, but you wake up cranky every morning.  Well, we don't have sex in the morning.  No, but I know.  I don't know.  But you just...  You start the day off cranky.  Do we kiss?  A lot.  You make out?  You don't make out?  Make in and out.  I tried the other day. 
[02:41:30]  Make in and out.  And it was just uncomfortable.  It was like kissing my cousin the other...  You know, we were trying to kiss.  Really?  Jesus.  What's wrong with her kissing?  It feels like your cousin.  No, we're just...  We're buddies.  Derek, thanks for the phone call.  Thanks.  All right, buddy.  Let's go to Josh in D.C.  Josh.  Hey, Jewy Juenstein.  That's pretty good.  You got to give him that one.  That has been done a hundred times.  Nope.  Nope.  Not on this show. 
[02:42:00]  Yes, a hundred times.  Not on this show.  Go ahead, Josh.  Jewy, why do you buy used cars?  Because you're...  Oh, I forget.  It was too mean.  You're a multi-millionaire.  You devalue every car you sit in.  I'm a multi-millionaire?  Congratulations.  Are you talking to...  Is that from the big TV deal?  Are you talking to Opie or Voss?  I'm not even a multi-100,000 air.  Well, I feel bad for you.  You devalue everything.  You need windshield wipers for the inside of your windshield. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, whoa, whoa.  Look at that.  Boy, another hacky stock ONA listener bit.  Whoa.  He spits when he talks.  Go ahead.  It was kind of clever.  At least I don't spend $2,500 to test drive a Rolls Royce and devalue it even more just by...  At least I don't listen and call in radio shows.  I go to them.  How about that?  How about that?  How about that, listener?  He's right there.  How about that?  Now, go load your truck and take your 15-minute break at 10 o'clock and go fuck your mother. 
[02:43:00]  How about that?  Why don't you try that?  Why do I pay $15 a month to listen to your story?  Because you worked overtime last month.  I don't know.  So you have extra money to spare, you fucking douchebag.  I get my series free and I don't even listen.  That's how I am.  I get free shit and I don't even use it.  Oh, God.  See you later.  You're hilarious.  You kill on stage.  I forgot one.  See you later.  Oh.  Oh.  Like he's...  You know what, Bob?  They try to slam you and then they go... 
[02:43:30]  Eric, what do you got for the show?  Eric was whispering in my ear.  Do you know, Rich, that Jimmy Fallon dedicated a song to you?  No, he didn't.  He did.  On our show?  On our show.  Jimmy Fallon...  Let me hear this.  Jimmy Fallon doesn't even know me.  He knows you.  Let me hear this.  Here it is.  All right, this one's dedicated to Rich Voss.  Jimmy Fallon.  No, fuck.  Well, it's so hard to have a conversation with you.  It's not what you say or what you do.  You're my real good friend. 
[02:44:00]  Yes, that I must admit.  That's why it breaks my heart to tell you this.  First of all, you guys set him up for that to do it, but he has a good voice. 
[02:44:30]  We didn't set him up to do anything.  I've never met him in my life.  But he came in to sing some songs a couple years back, and he said that.  He knows you.  He knows all the comics, Jimmy.  Yeah, and he probably listens occasionally, but he might have heard a clip or something.  He used to listen a lot.  He's too busy now.  He's got a good voice.  I hope he comes back on the show.  I still did.  He was supposed to do a college once, and he canceled.  Really?  And the day of Tom Papa's wedding.  I was supposed to go to Tom Papa's wedding.  Really?  And they called me to do the college, and I said to Tom Papa, I'm going to do the college.  Remember Alyssa from New Orleans earlier? 
[02:45:00]  What's that again?  Alyssa?  Alyssa?  The comedian?  She's got info on that comedy club.  Let's put her on.  We started with this.  We should end with this.  Did we talk to her already?  Yeah.  She was the one that called about the comedy club.  Yeah.  She wanted to know more about it, because she sees comedy twice a week in New Orleans.  Remember her?  Yeah.  She's back on the line.  Alyssa.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  First, this is the one I called in for, but if I could combine Jim, Jimmy, O-N-E, into one  guy, you guys would be perfect.  All your good parts only.  What's my good part? 
[02:45:30]  I know I have really fucking...  Oh, I'm a metalhead, Jim.  All right.  I'll take that.  Yeah.  A hot metalhead.  Hot metalhead.  Really?  You got it.  Scale of one to ten.  In New York.  Eight?  I was going to say in New York.  In Detroit, I'm probably a nine.  Yeah.  You know, I'm getting old.  I won't tell you how old I am, or Angela, hang up on me.  No.  We wouldn't do that.  I promise.  Do you have some info?  How old are you?  Yeah.  Okay, so I'm...  Well, how old are you first?  Don't hang up on me. 
[02:46:00]  No, I want to get...  I'm going to hang up on you.  I can't.  I want to hear her info.  I'm going to hang up on you.  How old are you?  Okay, first of all, I don't have any kids, and I take really good care of myself, and I  work out a ton.  All right.  If you're working out a ton, that means you're panicking, so you're upper 30s.  No, no, no, no.  Upper 30s.  You're saying your body's a ton?  You're working out a ton?  I'm working out a ton.  No, no, no.  I mean, they're shaping my life.  No, I drink beer every day, so I have to counteract it with...  A lot of sit-ups.  Beer belly shit.  A lot of sit-ups.  If you could compare my picture to guys, we're only 10 years apart. 
[02:46:30]  It's unbelievable, the difference.  Wait, can we see a picture of you online?  No.  And I don't take selfies or anything, and you follow me on Twitter, so you could probably  find a picture...  Wait, who follows you?  Anthony does.  Oh, he's not your Twitter name.  So you're 17.  He's the only Republican that I follow.  What is your Twitter name?  You'll get a lot of followers today.  No, no, no.  No.  Why?  Our listeners are nice.  They're really nice people.  No.  I hear the shit you people have to deal with, but I don't want it. 
[02:47:00]  Good for you.  Good for you.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I don't need the stress.  I live in New Orleans.  Life is good.  All right.  So what do you got?  I ate at that place Mama's or something.  Is that the name of it?  Oh, my God.  No one cares.  It's famous.  Catch up in a packet there.  Famous.  Famous place.  Mother's?  Mother's, yeah.  I know.  That's right.  I was so famous.  You are close, though.  I said Mama's.  It's Mother's.  That's close.  It must be good, because there's always a line, but it's corner service.  If I'm going to go out to eat, I want to sit down and be wined and dined. 
[02:47:30]  You ask a lot.  All right.  So what do you got?  What are the updates?  This is driving me crazy.  I don't know why I'm so invested in this.  So I texted.  I have a friend that works for the paper, and I have a bunch of friends that own bars.  So I texted, and a couple of chefs.  So I texted everybody that I know, and I'm just waiting.  So if one guy got back to me, and he said it sounded familiar, and he was going to look  into it.  So if Voss wants my number or something, or wants to get a hold of me somehow, I'll keep  him abreast.  I thought you had an actual update. 
[02:48:00]  You called back to say you almost have an update.  Well, okay.  I almost have an update.  You almost have an update.  What was the other thing?  Oh, I know that.  I was born and raised on an Indian reservation, so I know about Indian giver.  All right.  Do you want to hear about it?  What we were raised to believe, or what we were told our whole life, is it's not a bad  thing towards Indians.  It's a bad thing towards the white guy, because they would give the Indians shit, you know,  stuff, and then take it away, like treaties and all that.  And land and shit, right? 
[02:48:30]  Pardon me?  Land, I think.  Yeah, like land and, yes.  I think the white man would give the Indians land and then take it back.  Yeah, and they'd remade on the treaties.  That's how I heard it back in the day.  I don't know.  Yeah, it was never a derogatory thing towards us growing up.  We would say it about the white dudes.  Are you an Indian?  I am.  My dad is.  What kind?  Ojibwe.  Chippewa?  Northern Minnesota?  What's that?  So, uh, it had to be Chippewa.  What's that?  It had to be me.  What do you think of the Redskins in the controversy? 
[02:49:00]  No big deal.  I know.  I know.  My dad is a dyed-in-the-wool hard-core Indian rights activist.  Oh, I think you should get that off.  He doesn't give a shit.  He said it's an honor.  They did a new study, and 88% of a tribe up in Minnesota had no problem with the name.  It seems in general they don't.  I think the new mascot on our, because we have, like, a real school on the reservation,  and there's the kids, like, we all went to, normal people went to town to go to school. 
[02:49:30]  But I think the Rev school is something like the Tomahawks or something crazy like that.  So I even think their name would have to change.  Well, how about this?  It just hit the news today, I believe.  Native American group planning $9 billion lawsuit against the Indians and Chief Wahoo claiming the name and logo are racist.  What do you think of that?  I think it's so dumb.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers. 
[02:50:00]  I can see the Chili Peppers suing them for that name, the Chili Peppers.  Yeah, it's too close.  It's too close.  It takes Red out.  Well, what about the fucking saints?  I mean, if you want to really get into it, what about the religion?  It's all ridiculous.  Period.  I love you guys.  Thanks.  How old are you?  I'm going to be 40 in August.  Email me, rich at richwoss.com, so I can get some updates.  We nailed it, though. 
[02:50:30]  I said late 30s.  Yeah.  I figured she was around there.  Because as soon as a woman starts saying she's working out a ton, there's a whole panic setting in and it's a big birthday coming up.  Yeah.  That was obvious.  People think she's wearing a long shirt that covers her vagina and ass and it's just her stomach and back skin.  I thought you were saving the muffin.  He's eating the whole muffin.  He ate the whole muffin.  Why did you eat the whole muffin?  Yeah, he threw out the wrapper and he feels good because he didn't lick the inside of it.  No, I didn't.  I ate two thirds.  Shut up.  Better have chili papers.  Papers. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Let's see.  I won't eat again until tonight.  And you're leaving right here?  Right now for Boston?  Yeah.  No, I'm going to leave from here to go to Boston.  You know where that water's been?  Not open, baby.  There he's still using no pinholes.  Hey.  Stop eating a muffin with gum in your mouth.  What kind of psychopath does that?  He's cleaning out his teeth and his tongue and he has gum in his mouth.  They eat a muffin. 
[02:51:30]  Wait, how do you eat a muffin with gum?  He puts the fucking gum up in the corner of his lip and eats a muffin with his nicolette gum in his mouth.  You have to take it out, the gum.  Where am I going to put it?  I don't know.  On your vitamin paper?  That you wrapped up your vitamins in?  I'd do it out.  Yeah, exactly.  I thought he was opening a fucking eight ball of Coke.  Or a piece of red hot chili paper you might have?  Yeah, the old days, that would have been an eight ball of Coke, not ginkgo.  Put some nicolette gum up and eat them.  That's crazy.  That is nuts.  Oh, have you never taken two cocks at once? 
[02:52:00]  I didn't say that.  I don't have a good time.  I'm saying you're crazy for doing that.  Don't blame me.  Shut up, grandfather's sweatpants.  I don't know.  Better that than a grandfather's birthday on Monday.  She's the quickest person on the radio in all the country.  Huh?  I think we've done it.  She's a fucking radio genius. 
[02:52:30]  Why don't we...  Stand up.  Why don't we wrap up?  We did good today.  We did good.  So who's got a plug?  July 4th.  July 14th, I'm at Zaney's in Nashville, Tennessee.  One show.  And then tickets go on sale for my one-hour comedy special.  July 9th at the George Street Playhouse, New Brunswick, New Jersey.  What day is that?  What day are you taping?  Saturday night.  In July?  No, no. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, they're going on sale.  July 9th, yeah.  Oh, cool.  And Meet the Creeps, all the hidden camera stuff is actually on digital download now.  Yeah, you got it for five bucks on iTunes.  Big things happening for you, Jim.  A lot of big things.  Yeah, I got to announce it on Monday.  On Monday, not today?  Yeah, there's bigger stuff.  And don't forget the Unmasked with Ron Baines.  July 9th.  That's going to be great.  We went out to the stay in New York City.  Good for you.  I'm going to announce even bigger things on there.  Okay, that'll be good.  I don't want to jinx it.  No.  Rich, tonight through Saturday, Laugh, Boston in Boston. 
[02:53:30]  July 8th, the Penthouse article.  New CD coming out, My Wife Hates Me podcast.  And when the TV show is announced Monday, it's phenomenal.  Oh.  Will you announce it on Twitter?  Like, are you going to call into the show?  The O&A show?  To announce it?  I don't know what I'm doing on my...  You know, that whole birthday thing.  Like, I'm not one of those guys.  It's my birthday, and I don't give a fuck.  You know what I mean?  Just announce it.  No one knew it until you just said it.  Right.  They do know it. 
[02:54:00]  We won't even be talking about it.  I know.  You're on your profile.  I didn't know it.  I swear I didn't know it was your birthday.  But why would you know it, you fucking self-centered?  No, but you're saying that you don't talk about your birthday, but you just said it.  No, because the guy was talking about the age.  Rich, you don't know when our birthdays are.  We've all known each other forever.  When's my birthday?  When's my birthday?  Your birthday is in March, like something 16th or something around.  You're off by three days, not at a third of the year.  Yeah, it's like July 18th or 19th or something like that. 
[02:54:30]  Thank you, Jim.  So why is he self-centered?  When's my birthday?  When's your birthday?  September 18th.  Anthony's April 15th.  It's one out of a 365 birthday.  Do you know Bonnie's birthday?  Yes.  When is it?  I play her number, so I'm not going to fuck her birthday up.  And has it ever come out?  328, yeah, it's come out.  It has?  Oh yeah, 328.  Are you one of those guys that has to play the exact same numbers every time? 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Or do you mix it around a little bit?  You have your exact numbers.  Birthday, it's a kid's birthday, my birthday, and her birthday.  What if they're cursed with a bad birthday?  Then you're fucked.  There's no bad birthday.  It's a bad birthday if it doesn't come in.  From 328.  750,000.  My joke was bad.  No, how much is it?  Seriously?  I don't know.  I hit it maybe once or twice.  I hit it two days in a row in New York.  Two days in a row.  Five bucks?  Ten bucks?  No, like a couple hundred.  400, 500.  In New York, I won 1,000 on her birthday. 
[02:55:30]  Did you split it with her since it was her birthday?  Nothing.  She got nothing.  No, see, if you're using her birth.  And if I ever win, I always give the guy a tip at a lottery place that sold me the ticket.  I always go back and give him a tip.  You don't give a fuck.  You got to throw it back.  How much?  It depends.  You know, 20, 30 bucks.  Nice.  10%.  Are you up or down with the lottery?  Completely up.  And that's not gambling, though.  That's good.  I haven't gotten...  Oh, I quit again.  What, the gambling?  The lottery.  Gambling. 
[02:56:00]  I play a little here and there.  Jesus.  Jimmy's got plugs.  I do, yeah.  So does Anthony.  West Palm Beach.  10 through 12 with the Palm Beach Improv.  And...  That was Voss.  The Jizu Theater in Montreal, July 26.  Cobb is in San Francisco, August 7 through 9.  And Dallas, August 21 through 23. 
[02:56:30]  Great.  I'm sure they're all going like hotcakes.  You're giving a...  What are you doing in Montreal besides...  You're giving that big...  Keynote speech, yeah.  What else?  The Nasty?  Just that one.  No, I won't do the Nasty show.  It's too many fucking shows.  It's not enough money.  And then that one set.  What set?  The Jizu Theater it is.  Jizu.  It's G-U-S-U.  What night is that?  Are you doing the theater?  Is it Saturday or something?  We're there to Saturday.  Thursday afternoon is the keynote.  That's one in the afternoon.  At Thursday? 
[02:57:00]  Why are you yelling at me?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Can you have this conversation off mic?  Jimbo's room in the Comedy Works just closed after all this year.  Oh, no.  Did he really?  Yeah.  Why?  It was a great little room up in Montreal.  It was upstairs.  Why did he close?  I don't know.  It just wasn't doing the business, I guess.  But I mean, wouldn't he at least stay open until July through the festival?  Maybe he could make it.  Yeah, he probably couldn't make it.  What, you guys really liked Jimbo's room?  Yeah, he was one of the first guys to ever headline me.  Okay.  Rogan went back a few years ago and did it for free a whole weekend. 
[02:57:30]  Wow.  I would have went up and done that.  Just, you know, maybe if you would have just paid my hotel, I would have done that for  him.  I didn't know he was in trouble.  Fuck, he's a really nice guy.  He was open or something.  Yeah, maybe.  I don't know.  Yeah, it was just a tough guy.  Maybe you guys could rally a little bit if he's that great.  He's a great guy.  He's a really great guy.  One of the nicest guys.  Yeah, always brought up comics that, you know, new and upcoming New York comics, bring  them up their headline and stuff.  Let the Montreal people sing.  And he would just get drunk and put his arm around you and say nice things.  He was a great guy.  Sing karaoke at the end of the night, some Frank Sinatra at the bar.  Yeah, he was a good dude.  That club was owned by Ernie Butler. 
[02:58:00]  He worked for Ernie, and then he bought the club and took it over.  I don't know where Ernie Butler is.  Yeah, he was before him.  He passed away.  And then Jimbo took it over, and it was like a cool club.  It was a cool club.  I'm just sad to hear that.  When did they close?  Just recently.  Yeah, a few weeks ago.  Too bad.  He was a great guy.  Maybe he could open in New Orleans now.  Just a space.  Let's get out of here.  Thanks, guys.  The Opie and Anthony Show has gone to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments of today's show.
