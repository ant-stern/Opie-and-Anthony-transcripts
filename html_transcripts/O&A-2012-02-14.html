<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Whitney Houston's death, focusing on the graphic details reported by TMZ, including the “death tub” photograph, her financial struggles, and the inheritance left to her daughter.  Jim Norton, a guest in studio after covering the Grammys for NBC, participated in this discussion.  The hosts then attempted to determine the all-time best-selling musical artists, leading to humorous frustration with inconsistent online data.  Norton recounted his awkward encounter with Steve Martin at the Grammys, stemming from a negative comment about Martin in Norton's book.  Audio clips from Norton’s Grammy interactions with Steve Martin and Dave Grohl were played.

The show then veered into a bizarre, fictionalized and prolonged "rape" scenario repeatedly acted out by the hosts, Colin Quinn, and a guest named Will, with Tracy Morgan also present.  This was followed by a sexually explicit listener voicemail.  The hosts then discussed the birthdays of Pat O’Brien, Michael Bloomberg, Rob Thomas, and Drew Bledsoe, transitioning to a graphic discussion of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, Kate Upton, and comparisons to pornography.  Nicki Minaj's Grammy performance was criticized as “corny,” contrasted with praise for Adele’s performance.  Offensive remarks were made about Adele, Rick Santorum (mistakenly identified as Rick Sanchez), and Santorum's daughter.  A personal anecdote about an overflowing toilet in an apartment building, where Kathleen Turner lived downstairs, was shared.

A lengthy phone interview with UFC fighter Jon Jones followed.  They discussed his career, including an illegal elbow strike due to unfamiliarity with UFC rules, his upcoming fight with Rashad Evans,  UFC 3, other UFC fighters, and his personal life (including a Bentley and home design).  Mars, a UFC fan, was also present in the studio.  Jones mentioned his brothers who play in the NFL.  There was a promotional plug for UFC 3 and a brief mention of Roland Martin’s Twitter controversy.  This interview continued in a later segment, including a discussion of the differences between Jon and his brother Bruce,  a giveaway of UFC 3 games, and Jon Jones physically demonstrating chokeholds on Jim Norton, nearly rendering him unconscious. A punch to Norton's arm at 70% strength was also delivered.

Then, Tiny Sturgis and Flight Time, from the Harlem Globetrotters, joined the show.  Their height was a topic of conversation, alongside their careers, travel experiences, and anecdotes about playing basketball.  Audio clips of the chokeholds and punch were played.  A racist anecdote from "Uncle Paul" was briefly recounted.  A subsequent interview with Flight Time Lang discussed the Globetrotters' roster, including TNT Maddox and Jonte "Too Tall" Hall, their gameplay, history, and frequent appearances.  The hosts then recounted a previously-told "atrocious" story and speculated on Flight Time’s penis size. There was also mention of Bob Kelly's upcoming performances.

The show continued with a discussion about maintaining relationships in the entertainment industry, featuring frank and crude talk about sex and one host’s claimed 300-400 sexual encounters.  The decision of one host to commit to a long-term relationship was discussed, including his crying on his wedding night.  Their stand-up comedy careers,  aging, and a lost VHS tape were discussed.  The show concluded with a caller whose fiancé broke up with him, a mention of Nicole from the "morning mashup" outside the studio, a UFC video game giveaway, a brief improv skit with a UCB performer, and a detailed description of a chokehold incident between Jim Norton and Jon Jones, along with a hypothetical scenario involving paid choking during masturbation.  The broadcast ended with promotional material for an O&A Pictures project.

Whitney Houston still dead.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I didn't see him today.  No, I was all disappointed.  I walked in.  He wasn't at his post.  Who is that guy?  He'd abandoned his post.  There's no way he's security.  I don't feel safe with him.  I don't think he's security like, you know, take people down type of security.  I think he's just the guy that sits there and checks the badges. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, really?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Badge.  Check your badge.  Good morning, monie.  Jim Norton's back from L.A.  Yes.  After covering the Grammys.  For NBC.  The following program is brought to you in living color.  What was the noise after that, though?  Yeah, yeah.  It was kind of like a harp.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Peacock would show.  It's peacocky feathers.  Do you realize you were on camera during the e-coverage? 
[00:05:30]  I got your text, yeah.  I'm laughing.  How far back?  Which way was it?  Because I wanted to look and make a face, but I didn't know which way I was.  It was too late.  You were just, like, way in the distance.  But I noticed.  And a few other people noticed on Twitter.  Actually, someone on Twitter turned me on to it.  And I'm like, holy shit, yeah, there's Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I was watching the e-red carpet coverage with Ryan Seacrest.  Ah.  I hope Ryan is okay today, because that was a tough spot for him to broadcast under those  circumstances.  Oh, yeah.  Must have been. 
[00:06:00]  With death in the air.  I think he did a fine job keeping it very somber and asking everybody about Whitney Houston.  Oh, is that what he asked?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was all about it.  What do you think?  Any thoughts?  Yeah, yeah.  He was...  What are your thoughts?  Yeah, he was all about that.  Yeah.  What a fucking phony.  Well, everybody's pretty much done with the tributing and love and everything.  Now they just want to get down to what the fuck, how many drugs were in there, what type  of drugs, what about the doctor that prescribed, and what about booze?  Yeah.  Well, we said yesterday, you know, TMZ, you know they want the dead body picture. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  They came close.  They got the bathroom picture.  They did.  Oh, it's in the paper with little diagrams and everything.  Pointing to everything, saying, well, this is her turkey sandwich, this is a Heineken,  this is an ashtray, see the zash is on the floor.  Huh?  A gravy dish?  What?  The death tub.  They're calling it on TMZ.  The death tub.  But when we had Harvey Levin on our show, he's like, no, we're not vultures. 
[00:07:00]  We're not...  No, no, we're just reporting celebrity news and gossip.  You're vultures.  You got a headline that says the death tub.  What should we call this?  There's a new picture, by the way.  How about the death tub?  Was that in the actual tub, the gravy dish?  Looks like it.  Or it's on the ledge.  Was she just pouring gravy into her face and passed out?  I don't know.  But where's the other picture where they diagram everything?  The half-eaten turkey sandwich or a half-eaten hamburger?  Oh, really?  Is that what they did?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you, Mars.  Bring that over.  Turkey sandwich.  You fucking brown noser.  Mars.  Thank you, sir.  You weren't supposed to hear that.  Okay.  In the paper, you got the Heineken.  You got the half-eaten burger and fries.  You got the champagne glass.  You got the soda.  You got the teapot.  You got the teabags.  Who cares?  This really bothered me.  The covered turkey sandwich that she never ate that was next to the bathtub.  That doesn't bother me that it wasn't eaten.  She likes a side of jalapenos.  Who orders a side of jalapenos? 
[00:08:00]  That'll burn your ass.  Probably helped her shit better.  Oh.  Oh, you think?  If she was doing pills, I don't know if she was, but if she was doing pills, they may  have blocked her up.  Right.  So you never know.  She may have wanted some jalapenos to really help that shit fucking fly out of there.  Let it flow?  Yeah, that might have unclogged the fucking freeway.  And then you got a cigarette butt on the bathroom floor.  You got a razor on the bathroom floor.  You got ashes on the bathroom floor.  Shaving her legs and pussy.  She was probably a little bit under the influence.  Fucking just ashen.  She was going to eat.  What terrible breath she must have had after a bath. 
[00:08:30]  People said she had like cigarette booze breath.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  All the time?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, they were coming up to her at parties and at that party beforehand.  Around the hotel lobby, like she was walking around kind of just all weird and  stinking like cigarettes and booze.  Really?  Yeah.  And then you got the ashtray overturned.  That's hence the ashes on the ground.  And then inside out clothing.  So she was like just pulling her clothes off to take her back.  Get that shit off.  I was worried fucking like, oh boy, this is a big one. 
[00:09:00]  Before the Grammys.  Like this is going to be a motherfucker, man.  Yeah.  The fucking fans are going to relax too.  It's like, I tweeted like, why are we, like, why am I surprised no matter how much drugs  they've done when someone dies?  Because I am.  And I'm like, why am I?  And I'm like, sad news.  Because it's like when you're there and you're like, I'm going to have to be around these  people.  It's going to be depressing.  And what?  Yeah.  And they're like, what are you going soft?  It's like, listen, you faggots.  If I want to tweet a joke, I didn't mind anyone tweeting.  I just didn't have one.  No.  Well, a lot of people have the same bad ones.  I know.  They're waiting to exhale and all the burning hard. 
[00:09:30]  All right.  I just didn't have one until later that night.  And then I tweeted it when I thought of it.  I said it.  Right.  Yeah.  But these fucking fans, like, I love you guys.  But are we at a point where if you show compassion or if you just don't have a funny  joke at the moment and you say something nice about a person, all of a sudden  you're a sellout fucking faggot who is denying his old humor?  Well, you're not a sellout.  Thank you, Ant.  If you look deeper, it's a small, very small percentage of the audience.  Yeah.  Because people will, you know, come forward and go, oh, right on, man. 
[00:10:00]  You guys showed a heart today on the show.  I kind of liked that.  They don't want it all the time, but they enjoy when we show a little piece of that  from time to time.  Yeah.  I never find hiding that is needed ever.  I think we never hit it.  Right.  But people want us to just be, duh, duh, duh, every time.  Sometimes we can have a discussion about some real shit.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Whitney died very poor.  Was she broke?  Oh, well, now, like Ant said, you know, after the tribute and all that, now they're digging. 
[00:10:30]  Turns out she was begging for Benji's from pals at the end.  Benji being a $100 bill.  Wow.  She was basically asking people, hey, can I borrow $100?  Oh, man.  And, you know, when you have that type of status, people don't even think twice, like,  oh, yeah, I know you're good for it, or you'll get me back next time.  But, no, she really needed the hundreds.  She sold hundreds of millions of records.  What the fuck?  Well, what I don't understand, because I read the whole article, her 18-year-old daughter  is going to, they said, is going to become really wealthy. 
[00:11:00]  How?  Oh, insurance?  Well, because she inherited everything.  She inherited the record sales, basically.  But I guess the record sales weren't doing that well at the end of Whitney's life.  But now that she died, you know, some of these celebrities are worth a hell of a lot more  dead.  Right.  And now this 18-year-old is going to be a very rich woman.  It was odd.  Like, you think it's going to be, like, I was like, oh, my God, the fucking Grammys are  going to be a funeral dirge.  I was telling you before, I called Jim Wise, are we canceling this bit?  Like, are people going to feel like being playful? 
[00:11:30]  Because I knew what the bit was to try to promote my dumb CD.  Are they going to feel playful?  And he's like, well, let's just go and see what it is.  And there was a whole bunch of us.  And right next to us was Jet Magazine.  And there was another black station.  And every question, every artist, they were saying, so do you have any thoughts about Whitney?  That was just their line of questioning.  But it wasn't as sad as I thought it would be.  People were okay.  A couple people mentioned her.  But then I realized it's because she overdosed, people saw it coming. 
[00:12:00]  Like, when Michael Jackson died, nobody saw it coming.  Like, nobody knew he did propofol.  We knew he was weird, but we didn't know that he was fucking doing drugs.  So people were shocked.  It was like when Geraldo died.  People were very sad, but they weren't shocked.  But when Patrice died, it was like getting hit with a bat.  Because people knew he didn't get high.  Even though he was overweight or he was diabetic.  You see those as things that you can live with.  And I think people were just fucking waiting for her because she was such a fuck-up for so long.  Sure.  Good singer, but... 
[00:12:30]  Especially the industry insiders.  They got more of a scoop on how fucked up she was.  Yeah.  More so than we did.  Yeah, Clive Davis was propping her up.  Clive Owen?  I said Clive Owen yesterday.  That was funny.  No one picked up on it, though.  No.  Well, no one in the room.  Yeah.  There's always someone out there fucking...  They can't wait to tweet and make you feel like an asshole.  But in here, no one noticed.  Is it Davis or Owen?  I don't even know.  It's Davis.  Okay.  I said Owen a few times yesterday.  He was propping her up at the end of her life. 
[00:13:00]  And he finally said, look, man.  And he even talked to an L.A. radio station.  He's like, you got to go into rehab.  You got to get your shit together.  We got to get that voice back before we do anything else.  Yeah.  Because they did try.  And she just wasn't ready, obviously.  That was a couple years ago, right?  Because we played the audio.  Her voice was a disaster.  Terrible.  And he lent her over a million bucks to save her houses in, I think, Atlanta and Jersey.  And she was broke at the end there.  But just a completely irresponsible fuck-up. 
[00:13:30]  It's like...  Yeah.  I mean, all due respect, she's dead.  But you know what?  She was an irresponsible fuck-up.  When you're that good at something and you have the potential to make...  I mean, I guess it's easy to say.  But fucking, you got a kid, too.  Just fucking straighten up.  My thought yesterday on, it was pretty cold.  And you being an addict, I was like, look, after a while,  you got to lift yourself up.  She had all these people around her trying to get her to do the right thing.  But are you trying to tell me the addiction was that bad that she just couldn't see through it? 
[00:14:00]  It's hard also in that position.  Because the only difference between celebrities and regular people is, A, it's acceptable completely.  Yeah.  Like, if you work in an office and you pull the shit that entertainers pull...  Like, with Gerardo, we were used to it.  That was my friend.  He was a fuck-up, with that at least.  And I knew that a lot of times I would see him, he might have a story about being irrational or crazy.  And I was fine with it.  I felt for him.  But it didn't make me not want to talk to him.  Right.  You come into an office like that?  What were you doing?  I was fucking smoking crack all night. 
[00:14:30]  What?  What?  People wouldn't know how...  They'd fall all over the floor.  Imagine coming to work after, like, on a binge for a week.  You just take a week out of nowhere.  What happened?  Betsy wet her pants and smoked crack.  Right.  Really?  And her husband threw an ashtray at her.  Oh, where is she?  Oh, she's over there getting coffee.  I don't know.  I started partying in Jersey.  I woke up in Vegas in a bathroom.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened.  But I'm back to work now.  They would fire your ass.  It's acceptable.  Yeah, that's a good point. 
[00:15:00]  And when you're on that level, you get a lot of it for free.  Not all of it, but you have complete access to it at any time.  The connections are very hard, probably, to say no to.  In our dumb little world, we're offered shit all the time.  You know?  Yeah.  If it's very gettable and very available and very accessible, I'm not saying that they have a harder time than Bowery Street bums.  But, I mean, it's always there.  I mean, it's kind of tougher when people are... 
[00:15:30]  I can equate them in a way to Bowery Street bums, because with bums, it's acceptable, too.  Sure.  Like, no matter what you do, you know, you're shitting on a manhole cover and your friends are cool with it.  Hurry up.  We're smoking.  All right.  They're saying she was almost homeless.  Almost homeless if it wasn't for Clive Davis.  Damn.  She signed for $100 million back in the day.  I was telling that before the show.  $100 million in the 80s.  When did she hit?  84, maybe?  Yeah, early 80s.  And that's signed.  And then she gets... 
[00:16:00]  And then she gets...  The record.  Concerts.  Well, she was making $30 million a year touring on top of that.  How do you fuck that up?  And how do you go through...  I don't understand if it's possible to go through all that money.  How is it possible?  Hearing that dumb Bobby Brown just doing drugs, probably making bad investments.  What the fuck happens to people?  My accountant told my manager, Jim is already smart.  He knows where every penny is.  And that's...  Believe me.  That's what he sounds like.  Well, you want that.  Watch your money, man.  What are you doing?  Fucking $100 million? 
[00:16:30]  You want your accountant to sound like that.  I want my accountant to sound like that.  I don't want my accountant to go, yo, man, you doing all right?  What?  Yeah, what?  Who are you?  Wait a minute.  Who's the Jewish fella?  If I could find an accountant with payas?  Paces, whatever.  How do you...  Yeah, yeah.  Paces.  Paces?  Paces, apostrophe.  Paces.  It's just payas.  If I could find one of those guys, I would hire them tomorrow to watch my money.  All over Brooklyn.  Oh, the jewier, the better.  Yeah.  The accountant.  Need that accountant.  What else about Whitney today? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, they're flying her home, and they might do the funeral at the Prudential Center.  They might make this a big spectacle.  They're wondering...  They might put that body in the middle of the ice where the fucking devils play and let  people march in and out for a few days.  It's back in Newark.  Newark.  She's her...  Her body is back in Newark.  Newark, yeah.  And better than ever.  She's back.  And yeah, they were talking about that, but I think there's a game they were saying.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So they gotta wait?  They might...  Yeah.  They might do it at the church she sang at when she was a child. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, how about the church?  I mean, she was...  Yeah.  She was a big death, though, man.  I kind of equated it.  I'm like, that's like fucking Pacino dying the day before the Oscars.  Oh, really?  Like, that's the...  Yeah, man.  Fuck.  She was a massive singing star.  And she sold 170 million records.  More than that.  Over 200 million.  Now they're saying over 200?  Over 200 million.  Do we have the all-time list?  She's fallen off, though.  She has, but so has Pacino.  Yeah.  He's not doing The Godfather 2 anymore.  I'm just saying, oh, yeah. 
[00:18:00]  I don't disagree with Jimmy.  A massive...  Pacino's won one Oscar.  He's won...  I mean, he's been famous since the 70s.  She got famous in 84.  But she's a massive fucking star.  I love Pacino, but he never did a fucking arena.  Pacino never packed 20,000, 30,000 people a night into it.  He didn't make 30 million a year, Pacino.  You don't think so?  No.  For some of those movies?  Nah, he made a lot, but I doubt 30 million.  I want to see the all-time sales.  I want to see where Whitney is on that list. 
[00:18:30]  And who's number one?  Is the Beatles still number one?  It's the Beatles, yeah.  Has to be, right?  Elvis is right up there, too.  Elvis, Michael Jackson.  Eminem is high up on the list.  Eminem, Slim Whitman.  Slim Whitman.  He's number 4,872.  I heard he sold more records than the Beatles and Elvis combined.  Really?  We did this break.  We're going to do the same break again.  Remember, and then we're going to be surprised that Slim Whitman sold a lot of records.  Wait a minute.  We're not going to really understand it.  I know.  Sam, how come you're not doing this faster?  Sam's terrible at the internet.  Oh, boy.  He's not even smiling. 
[00:19:00]  He's like...  Good.  Well, these computers lock up.  It's crazy.  Well, they're Windows.  Windows fucking blow.  Stinks.  Windows stinks.  Hey, fucking Mac fanboy.  You're just an Apple shill.  You know what?  When I turn on my computer, it works.  I like that.  Yeah.  It doesn't freeze up.  Oh, God.  Are we on this?  He doesn't.  God bless little Sam.  He doesn't know what he's doing.  He's a complete boob.  Little Sam.  Are we on this, Sam? 
[00:19:30]  Sam's a yutz.  That's just a weird screen.  Can we have a nice website where it's like one, two, three?  I didn't design the website.  That's like a spreadsheet.  We have to figure out too much with this.  What is that?  What do you want?  Like, just where it says top ten all-time selling artists, and it's like number one, number two, number three.  Sam knows.  He's just being belligerent.  Are you, Sam?  That's right.  It's being uppity.  That's right.  See, this is more of a spreadsheet.  It's the same thing.  Exactly.  Who's got number one?  Beatles.  All right.  We can handle this.  So, we got the Beatles. 
[00:20:00]  One billion to 600 million sales.  What does that mean?  Or is it one billion, 600 million?  I think it's between one billion, 600 million.  Well, that's a big difference.  I know.  One billion at 600 million.  That's a big difference.  One billion.  What is it?  Wait, wait.  I made one billion dollars, 600 million pounds.  Oh, God.  Let's go up to the top of the website before I stand here.  Yeah, look at the key.  Sam found a weird fucking spreadsheet. 
[00:20:30]  Where's the legend?  We need a legend.  Can you find another one now?  All right, but it's Beatles, Elvis, Michael.  Hold on.  Oh, wait.  The number is claimed, and then the other one is sales, I think.  That's how they're all right.  So, they're claiming one billion.  But they've sold 600 million.  They've sold 600 million.  Elvis is claiming a billion.  They've sold 600 million.  So, the Beatles and Elvis are pretty much tied for the number one spot, it looks like.  Michael Jackson is claiming 750 million, but sales say 350 million.  Okay.  ABBA is number four. 
[00:21:00]  Wow.  Oh.  370 to 300 million?  Right.  Madonna?  Fuck.  Madonna's at 275 million.  Let's just go with that number.  Okay, sure.  It makes it easier.  Easier.  Zeppelin, 200 million.  And what plays?  Two, three, four, six plays.  Queen.  Queen.  150 million.  So, where's Whitney?  I don't know.  Didn't she do more than a...  I thought so, too, but apparently not.  Maybe you were right.  Maybe it was 170.  Celine is on the list.  Oh, Whitney.  Okay, you were right.  But why should all the way down there, if the 170 is higher than 150? 
[00:21:30]  I hate the list you picked.  Yeah, Sam, you picked the shitty list.  You picked the shittiest list ever, Sam.  Let's start.  Let's find another list.  Okay.  Oh, Sam.  Hope you get dumped at your wedding.  That'll teach you to pick a better list.  All right.  This one has pictures, so this could be a good one.  This could be a good list.  It has pictures.  Now we're looking at Elvis Presley at number one.  Literally the same list.  Huh?  No, it's not.  No, it's not, because the other list had the Beatles tied with Elvis.  That's right.  This one has Elvis as number one.  And what is Sinatra doing on there? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, exactly.  How is it the same list?  Same list?  Yeah.  All right, go back up.  Naina.  And what list is this?  Top Ten Land.  What do they know?  Nothing.  Top Ten Land.  What, are we just going to take that as, like, because it's on the internet?  Top Ten Land.  Jesus.  Does that have cred, the Top Ten Land?  I don't think so.  I don't know about that.  All right, so you got Elvis Presley, then the Beatles, Michael Jackson.  Sinatra now is on the list.  And Ab is way down the list now. 
[00:22:30]  And then you got Zeppelin at six.  Nana Muscori.  Get me another list.  Oh, Sam.  She might be from Europe.  Have you ever heard of Nana?  I've seen her twice.  Muscori.  Yeah, I've heard of her.  No, you haven't.  Yeah, they used to have late night commercials for her.  Name one song.  I don't know.  She does the bungee hat.  That's a big Nana Muscori song.  The bungee hat.  I'm wearing my bungee hat.  Tino Rossi.  Yeah, she's good.  Tino Rossi's a whore. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, she used to work with Martini.  Remember?  They sold beverages, boo.  Tino Rossi's a whore.  Yeah, they sold Asti Spumanti.  Yeah.  You got a better list down there, Ant?  I don't have a list at all.  No one's got the list down there.  No.  All right.  Well, what are you going to do?  Jesus.  What was the point?  We got another list?  That's right.  This is it.  All right.  This is the list.  Top 10 best-selling overall acts of all time, albums and singles, from Vanity Edge. 
[00:23:30]  It's on a message board.  There's no way it could be not that cool.  Who's Vanity Edge?  That'd be true.  That's not true, Sam.  This one has Madonna in fourth place, so they can't figure this out.  And then Elton John is in fifth.  We didn't even talk about Elton John on the other list.  The Stones pop out of nowhere.  Celine Dion.  We weren't talking about her earlier.  I don't.  I'm sure they're now down to ninth place on this list.  What the fuck?  Come on.  And Mariah Carey's a tenth.  Maybe there is no ultimate list.  Maybe they're all going to vary and differ.  Oh, that would suck. 
[00:24:00]  There's got to be facts.  Oh, forget it.  We don't even know.  Thank you, Sam.  We can't even check facts with an internet.  I can tell you this much, because it's about Whitney.  She's out of the top ten on all these lists.  Yeah.  But you know what?  She had a great start.  She should have been...  Right.  She was only 48.  She technically could still...  Not technically, because the genre she's in, she certainly could have still had music  out there that people really would have enjoyed.  Some of that shit like, you know, that older person's music. 
[00:24:30]  Nice, mellow, voicey shit.  They call it AC in the biz.  Oh, is that it?  AC.  Adult contemporary.  Ah, right.  Yeah.  Like her cousin, Dionne Warwick, perhaps.  Who's her cousin?  I think so.  That fucking stupid stegosaurus mouth Dionne Warwick has.  Stegosaurus?  Her dumb reptile mouth.  See what she looks like now?  She's awful.  She's completely gray.  Oh, yeah?  She gave up on the black hair.  Look, there's a picture in the paper today.  Whoa, that doesn't even look like her. 
[00:25:00]  That's her.  That's her.  That's her.  That's her.  That's her.  That's her.  That's her.  That's her.  That's her.  Mandela.  She's got that, yeah, it's white hair with that weird bleached and sort of blonde.  Yellowish.  And parts yellowish.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So where were we?  Go to Billboard, they're saying, dumbass.  Oh, Billboard.  They called you dumbass, not me saying it.  Well, no, you did.  No.  No, David Byrd from Ohio did.  Okay, I'm at Billboard.  All right, let's do this now.  Let's do this.  You want the all-time best-selling artist?  Yeah.  Beatles.  Second?  Elvis. 
[00:25:30]  Elvis.  Third?  Michael Jackson.  And why do you think your list is better than the four that we've just looked at?  Because I know what I'm doing.  Oh, shit.  And it sounds better.  Yeah.  It sounds better.  The one that was the first list we looked at.  Oh, no.  Number four is Madonna.  Number five is Elton John.  Right.  Led Zeppelin.  That's the Wikipedia list that you guys couldn't read.  Oh, Queen.  Oh.  ABBA.  Yeah.  ABBA.  They were big.  So, what?  What are you trying to say, Sam?  Who else?  This was the first list that was up, right?  Yeah, but it looked like a spreadsheet.  We couldn't figure it out. 
[00:26:00]  Who else?  It's the same.  Oh, look.  There's the list.  And it had the two.  Isn't that the one that had the two amounts on it?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, we didn't like the two amounts, Sam.  Well, one is claimed sales total.  The other is separated by markets, if I'm reading it correctly.  What?  Now we have to worry about markets.  The Beatles have sold 207.6 million units in the United States.  But how did they do in Cleveland?  In Cleveland?  Terribly. 
[00:26:30]  They didn't do well in Cleveland.  No.  I heard there weren't a lot of Beatles fans up there over the years.  Yeah.  For some reason, it just never caught on in Cleveland.  It's too bad.  You missed a lot of great music up there, guys.  Uh, all right.  So what did we learn?  We didn't learn anything there.  Sam had it right the first time.  So you guys are just assholes, I guess?  No.  Why are we assholes?  Yeah, why, Sam?  Why the language?  There's a bunch of different lists with a bunch of different names.  Why couldn't you give us the list all nice?  I didn't write the list.  We had to kind of figure out shit. 
[00:27:00]  The list is here.  Man.  You'd like to know.  Whitney is number four with the Bodyguard soundtrack right behind ACDC.  That's albums.  That's not artists.  What?  That's album sales.  All right, let's do top albums of all time.  Okay.  Thriller.  I think the Eagles is number one.  What?  Is the Eagles number one?  More than Thriller?  No.  What?  Eagles greatest hits.  It might be.  I think Thriller's number one.  I think, yeah.  Yeah.  Can you read this list?  It's a little spreadsheet-y, but we'll go with it.  Yeah.  Jackson's Thriller is the number one album of all time. 
[00:27:30]  What's number two?  Let me guess.  Is it one of the Beatles greatest hits?  No.  No.  I didn't think so good.  The Beatles are not even in the top ten.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, because they had shitty albums.  They probably had a lot of greatest hits, too, which went into The Money.  No.  Problem with the Beatles, they had too much stuff to choose from.  Let me see some.  Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon, in second place.  Huge drop-off, by the way, between Thriller and The Dark Side.  That'll never be beaten.  Thriller? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  What's the, what does it sell?  110 million.  Wow.  ACDC.  That's a million?  I thought it was just 110.  No.  No.  Despicable beat that.  ACDC, back in black, is in third place.  Look at that.  That's awesome.  50 million for Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon.  And ACDC is nipping on their heels.  They can move into the second spot.  And then you got Whitney Houston, the bodyguard, in fourth place at 44 million.  Okay.  Oh, that's right.  Bat Out of Hell.  Meatloaf in fifth place. 
[00:28:30]  Wow.  How weird was he when he came in here?  Oh, man.  You know, that doesn't really count, because that's Whitney Houston and various artists.  Yeah, but that song.  You think people bought the album for it?  No.  It was for various.  For I always love you.  Indeed, I will always love you.  Very good.  I was actually really good at taking the lullaby from one.  I just love annoying people at 640. 
[00:29:00]  I'm going to see the top ten still.  All the way.  And running out the list is Eagles, and then a band called Various Artists.  Bee Gees.  What?  Oh, the Dirty Dancing album.  It says artists, Various Artists.  You think it's, I had the time of my life.  You think they bought it for that song?  Terrible song.  Yeah.  Not if two retards sing it. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, I know.  That's true.  Bee Gees, Fleetwood Mac.  Oh, the Saturday Night Fever album.  Yeah, that's right.  And rounding out the top ten, Shania Twain.  There's a surprise.  That bitch hold a lot of records.  There's a surprise.  Damn.  That bitch is arched.  That's a lot of records.  No rock artists.  Except for what?  There's ACDC and Pink Floyd.  Yeah, no real rock artists.  Meat Loaf.  No.  He's a rock artist.  No, no.  No, no.  I hate them.  Stand back, stand back. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  That was her solo record.  What was that big song?  You can go your own.  Yeah, I actually do like that one.  Don't Stop Believin'.  Don't Stop Believin'.  I'm thinking about tomorrow.  Don't Stop Believin' is Journey.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't.  What else did they do?  Wait, what's the one you just sang?  Don't Stop Believin'.  I'm thinking about tomorrow.  That's Fleetwood Mac.  Yeah, they had some good songs.  That's where I fucked up.  Adding the believing part.  Yeah.  Ah. 
[00:30:30]  Hmm.  Master girlfriend's so dumb, she thought that at the end, Tony Soprano was murdered  because she thought the song said, Don't Stop, Get Even.  Oh, yeah.  Did I say that already?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's still funny, though.  Yeah.  Wow.  Boo.  So what happened with Steve Martin there, Jimmy?  Oh, God.  I was howling when you tweeted that.  Well, we get there.  I love when my friends get uncomfortable.  Oh.  And, you know, we get there nice and early.  I have to go get my Grammy ID. 
[00:31:00]  We get there set up, and we don't know what the day is going to be like because, again,  it's going to be a funeral dirge.  So we do a bunch of artists, just like Vince Gill and a bunch of, you know, cool people.  And then I see Steve Martin right next to us talking to billboard.com.  It was right next to us.  And he's with his band.  The banjo band?  They were nominated for two Grammys.  Yeah, but it's still the banjo.  Yeah.  I mean, let's be honest with each other. 
[00:31:30]  Bluegrass.  So I fucking go, I said, let's try to get Steve Martin.  And I said to his publicist, I'm like, with The Tonight Show.  And she's like, okay.  And then I said to the camera guy, I don't know if he'll talk to me.  Because I didn't know if he knew who I was or not.  So he comes over and we say hello.  And I start.  The bit was, if you didn't see the bit, was me.  I'm tired of never being nominated.  So I was showing everybody my CD, asking them if they would hold it up on camera or if they won, 
[00:32:00]  would they wave it and hold it up and talk about me?  You know, just being an ass.  Right.  And it was despicable.  So we're talking for a couple of minutes.  And he couldn't have been nicer.  He was funny.  He was, he laughed when I was funny.  Oh, no.  You'll see some of it on the bit, but you won't see all of it because they had to edit.  But he was really funny and nice to you, right?  Can I play the clip before you?  Sure.  You think that makes sense?  Yes.  Okay, let me play the clip first. 
[00:32:30]  Some of it's visual.  From The Tonight Show.  Norton at the Grammys for The Tonight Show.  Here's him and Steve Martin.  Obviously with the great Steve Martin.  Nominated for Best Bluegrass.  Best Bluegrass Album, yes.  Not Best Bluegrass.  Yeah, that really would be a lousy nomination.  The best sod.  So now, what do you do if you lose?  Oh.  You know, I haven't, I haven't even considered that.  What a great thing.  Thank you for putting that out there.  You're an actor, an actor, a singer.  Do you feel like, well, yeah, musician, you know. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, okay.  Sorry.  I'm thinking of David Hasselhoff.  You're an actor.  You're a musician.  What made you think you would want to make the jump to music from acting?  Why would you make that big jump?  Pure ego.  Pure ego.  Yes.  Now, I've never been nominated for anything.  I know that's hard to imagine.  Yeah, you know that makes a lot of sense.  To some people, it may.  But I have a comedy CD.  That's really me in high school.  Would you hold that up if you win?  What?  It's not about me.  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to listen to this in my car on the way home. 
[00:33:30]  Please do.  Yeah.  With the volume down.  With the volume down.  It's always best with no volume.  And that was the segment.  Now, some of that happened before, and some of that happened after.  We were talking, but he was being really charming and fun, and he was a genuinely nice guy.  And then when I took the CD out, he looked at it, and he went, Jim Norton.  Oh, no.  And I forget the exact word, but he goes, you bad-mouthed me, or you wrote some nasty things about me.  Oh, no. 
[00:34:00]  He's not supposed to know this.  And I went, yeah, I did.  You just said that?  Yeah, I did.  I had to.  But I was like, but I'm a fan.  I felt, I knew there was no way to explain it.  And he goes, it's okay.  You're forgiven.  And I'm like, I really do like you.  And he goes, that's okay.  It's okay.  Like, he was, I think he was uncomfortable with it.  But I think it was after that that I asked him to hold it up, and he actually, you can't  see it, but he actually laughed when I said, will you hold it up?  And then he was still, that's when he said, listen to it with the volume down. 
[00:34:30]  Like, he was still funny after that.  Wow.  And he goes, all right, we got to, because they had to move along anyway.  But he was very, very pleasant.  And I felt awful.  I felt genuinely fucking terrible, dude.  Oh, man.  Now, what did he, what did he get wind of?  Don't know.  I didn't ask, because his band was there, and there was a camera.  He didn't want to get into it.  But he wasn't confrontational.  Like, and I've been thinking about nothing but that for the last couple of days. 
[00:35:00]  I feel so fucking guilty about it and bad.  But, because it was like, it was really mean shit that I said about him.  What did you say, or you don't want to say anything?  Well, yeah, I mean, it's in the book.  Just about, I was making fun of the, the Pink Panther, him doing the Pink Panther.  Right.  But, I just, it came off really fucking mean.  And I didn't just stick to the Pink Panther.  Like, I mean, I, like, it's funny, I was talking to, I know I'm a little off subject,  but I was talking to, to Jay before we went out and did the bit, the rehearsal. 
[00:35:30]  And he goes, ah, I heard you got bagged by Steve Martin.  I'm like, yeah, I did.  And, and he goes, hey, welcome to my world.  I'm like, what do you mean?  He goes, oh, every day I get that from somebody.  Like, he goes, hey, that joke you did.  And I'm like, yeah, but I didn't.  What about jokes?  Well, people get mad, yeah.  He fucking shits on people.  They get mad.  And then he has to have them on the show.  Right.  But, I'm like, yeah, but I did more than a joke.  I wrote this thing.  I'm like, I don't think you read the book.  And I'm like, it was about him doing Clouseau.  And I was, I felt it was disrespectful to Peter Sellers. 
[00:36:00]  I got really annoyed about it.  He goes, why?  He goes, I'm like, I don't know.  It was Peter Sellers' thing.  I'm like, yeah, but he goes, and he makes a good point.  He goes, yeah, but who's the guy playing, he goes, who's the guy playing Bond?  He goes, Daniel Craig's playing Bond.  He didn't steal that from Sean Connery.  I'm like, oh, I know he didn't.  Oh.  Like, why, it bothers me.  I don't regret attacking Al Sharpton.  I don't regret attacking Jesse, I'm sorry, Jesse Jackson at all.  I literally, I really, do you regret Steve Martin because he called you out on it? 
[00:36:30]  No.  No, no, no.  Because I think your point is pretty valid about the whole Pink Panther.  But here's what bothers me about.  That was such a Peter Sellers thing.  Here's what bothers me about my attack on Steve Martin.  I attacked him for things.  Like, it was, it wasn't necessary because he never did anything to me.  Like, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, like, those guys go after people's jobs.  We know why we hate them.  I just didn't like a movie choice he made. 
[00:37:00]  And this is, I'm not being Hollywood Jimmy.  We're not going to work together.  My career has not been hurt by this at all.  It's not going to help my career to feel bad about.  It's really not.  I mean, I'm in a very lucky position as a comedian.  I can pretty much say and do what I want.  I have very little parameters where I can get in big trouble.  And I've had almost no repercussions my entire career.  This one I just feel bad about.  Because it's like he was so fucking nice.  I thought, like, this guy, here's this guy.  Like, who the, like, he's fucking hosted the Oscars. 
[00:37:30]  He was great.  And I've said that.  I didn't like the Pink Panther.  But he's fucking a best-selling author.  And he's being nominated for Grammys.  And then to have to have this in his head, like, some shithead comic that shit on him,  it really annoyed me.  Because when other comedians shit on me, it bothers me.  Like, regular people shitting on you is one thing.  But when another comic attacks you, you feel worse about him.  Your peers.  And I typically, well, he's not even a peer.  He's so in the stratosphere above me. 
[00:38:00]  No, I understand.  But you're in the same game is what I'm saying.  Yeah.  And I don't typically fuck with other comedians.  You know that.  Like, even guys that come in here.  Like, we've had some guys come in and not do well.  I don't fuck with them.  I just, I have a real love for comics and a real camaraderie.  And I feel bad about it for that reason.  Like, I was on the plane with Sharpton after I trashed him.  And I said hello.  But I had no guilt.  I had no, oh, no, he might know who I am.  I really didn't.  So did you?  You were on the plane with Sharpton and you didn't take one for the team and open the door? 
[00:38:30]  What I don't understand is, like, did he feel shitty about the Steve Martin thing before this whole thing went down, though?  The ones I have felt bad about, a little, the things I have felt bad.  Oh, so you have felt bad about some of the guys you wrote about?  Yes.  Oh, interesting.  Because, and this is what bugs me about the fans.  Like, when you have a moment like this, they're like, oh, you're going to Hollywood.  You're changing.  No.  Don't worry about them.  I'm not.  I'm still a piece of shit.  The people that don't understand are out there.  I felt bad.  And I've said this before.  Part of my Hillary Clinton attack I felt bad about because I like her more now than I used to. 
[00:39:00]  And there were certain things I attacked her for which were legit.  And there were other things I was like, eh, I kind of felt a little bit bad about.  My Heather Mills chapter I don't feel bad about.  But I was a little douchier to Paul McCartney than I should have been because I genuinely like him.  It's like, in the spirit of being honest and funny, I should have blasted people.  Like, I like to fucking blast hard targets.  Like, I don't pick.  And not that Steve Martin's an easy target, but he's a guy that never did anything to me.  Like, you know what I mean? 
[00:39:30]  Like, he's never been.  But it wasn't about that.  It was about him taking on the Pink Panther movies.  The tone of what I wrote.  That's still bothersome, I think.  I didn't like it, but the tone of what I wrote didn't just reflect that.  The whole book was very fucking angry.  And I don't regret writing the book.  Well, it is called I Hate Your Guts.  Yeah, and he shouldn't have been in that category.  Like Maxwell, the guy from Cleveland who fucked with us.  I don't dislike him anymore at all.  He's fired from radio.  That sucks.  I don't want to see any guys get shit-canned.  But I don't regret what I wrote about him because it was a response to him fucking with us. 
[00:40:00]  It was a response to him saying mean shit about me.  So I don't feel bad about it at all.  Not an ounce of guilt.  No matter how vicious it was.  That shit was fun.  It was.  That shit was fun when it went down.  I forgot all about him.  But this one, kind of, because he's a comic, it's like, ugh.  I just felt really bad about it.  And then meeting him and then realizing we're at the Grammys and he's been nominated.  And again, if he was a guy that fucked with me, but he wasn't.  He's just a guy doing a movie I didn't like. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  And a guy who I loved my whole life growing up.  And then all of a sudden I'm just like, well, fuck it.  Like, what's wrong with me?  Like, what, it was, it wasn't.  I think you're being a little harder on yourself than you need to be.  I'm not fucking, I don't want to put myself through a window.  No, no, I don't mean that.  I mean, like, just hearing what you're saying looks, it seems a little more than you should  even be.  I don't think so.  I feel it because, again, seeing what he was like as a guy who's a nice dude, I don't  feel bad making fun of the Pink Panther. 
[00:41:00]  But he was so genuine and willing to be pleasant.  It was like, he didn't do anything that deserved that tone.  Where Sharpton, no matter how nice he was, has done shit that deserved that tone.  All right, then let's talk about the tone.  Because I think what you said about Steve Martin and the Pink Panther movies, I'm going to say  it again, was right on.  But maybe the tone of it is what bothers you.  It's a very good observation, Jimmy.  You have Russell Brand, who's doing the fucking Arthur movie, hoping to get another one.  And we've always said on this show that we hate when, you know, great comedies are remade. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  We hate it.  I agree.  I mean, we've talked about other movies that they remake, and it kind of makes sense because  the technology has changed, and you know what I mean?  Right.  But with comedy, comedy is what it is.  You know, if something's funny, it's funny.  I would love to sit Steve Martin down and ask him, if someone came along in another  five years, let's say, and decided to redo The Jerk, would you be okay with that?  Because that was an amazing movie, right?  He might be.  He probably would.  That's what I would love to ask him.  You know what he might say if you ask him about Pink Panther? 
[00:42:00]  And this is, I've been thinking, I was on the plane the whole night.  Yeah, man.  He might go like, I love Peter Sellers.  Like, I was honored to do that, even though I didn't love what he did.  But he may come from that place like, I love Peter Sellers.  Like, it was an honor to play the role that he played.  Like, I just thought of all this shit last night, and that's why I feel like making fun  of it is one thing.  But, like, there's no way to spin what Jesse Jackson or Sharpe, I keep raising them because  I literally can't remember a lot of people I went after, but those are the two big ones. 
[00:42:30]  Or Oberman, say.  There's no way to spin what Oberman did.  And I would probably like Oberman if I met him.  I've heard he's a good guy.  But there's no way to spin what he did to not make me angry.  Like, there's no way to spin him attacking fucking Imus without making me angry.  But that's where all of my anger was coming from at that time, was that fucking politically  correct shit and feeling like we were under attack and nobody was sticking up for people  saying unpleasant stuff.  And he got caught up in the tone of that, as opposed to me just making fun of the movie 
[00:43:00]  or shitting on the movie poster.  I don't know if it makes, but it makes, to me, as a performer, it makes sense.  And I don't, if people think I'm backing down, well, I just felt really, I felt bad about  it.  And it doesn't behoove me to say that.  It doesn't help my career.  Believe me, I'm not going to be a big fucking, we're not doing a movie together.  I just, as a guy, felt bad.  That's, you know.  No one is saying.  There's some honesty right there from Jim Boren.  I should apologize.  No one is saying I should do anything.  I just, as a person, felt bad. 
[00:43:30]  I now understand the tone of what you said.  But I, you know, I feel like someone like Steve Martin has so many opportunities in Hollywood  to make funny movies and to go down, go down the Peter Sellers road just was bothersome  to me.  Like, really?  You have to do that?  You've had an amazing career and it seems like you must be getting a lot of scripts that  you can make really funny.  But can you imagine if he said, like, I just, I loved Peter Sellers.  I thought he was a genius.  I'm sure he would say that.  Like, but, like, that's not the place that I thought it was. 
[00:44:00]  When I wrote that, I'm thinking it's coming from this place of fucking disrespect for Peter  Sellers and fuck him, I'm better.  Like, why would I think that?  It was such idiocy.  I, uh, I love to think that Steve Martin is so mean and calculating that he knew that  would get to you more than just saying, ah, fuck off and walking away.  Like, like, as he walked away from you, he turned to somebody he knows and goes, that  ought to hold that little fucker for a while.  I do.  Like, just knowing that that would torture you, that he was nice. 
[00:44:30]  But he was nice before that.  And I know he didn't recognize me because he reacted naturally, but it was probably embarrassing  for him because his band was there.  Like, I could tell he didn't want to talk about it and I wasn't going to, but I felt  as a person, I've never been pressured to apologize by a company or anything.  I mean, I just never, I've had free reign.  This one I feel bad about on my own.  More importantly, I'm amazed that you guys both could move on from that and get some funny  shit done for Leno.  It's like you just told us, like the clip we played, some of it happened before he called 
[00:45:00]  you out and then some happened afterwards.  I love that he called me.  I really, it was a relief.  It was a really, because I felt like a fraud talking to him.  Does he know?  Does he not know?  I just, I felt like a fucking, an absolute fraud.  You should write him a note.  I don't know if it'll ever get to him.  I've been thinking about it.  Write a nice note.  I can absolutely get a note to him.  Or, I used to have his phone number.  Did you?  Oh yeah.  I'll text him.  That wouldn't give him the creeps.  This goes way back.  Someone let me in on the fact they had Steve Martin's phone number. 
[00:45:30]  And I used to call him at BAB.  And he would go, hello.  And that's all I would put on the air.  I was too scared of talking to him.  Of course.  Because you can't cold call the celebrity in general.  No.  It's kind of against the rules.  No.  Man.  So Steve, that was me.  Way back.  I wonder how he found out.  I would call him every night.  How do you find out?  I wonder how and the moment.  I would love to know all that shit.  You Google yourself at a time of the book.  Oh yeah.  Where someone tells him, you know this asshole Jim Norton.  I don't even know if he ever read it. 
[00:46:00]  I don't even know if he read it.  Why are you saying how did he know?  The book was on the Times.  No, no.  I know.  Not so much how did he know.  I want to know the exact moment he read it.  And what he thought.  Dude, coming from anybody else, it would have been annoying.  But there is.  I've read so much.  I've read it.  And I get a lot of hate tweets.  And a lot of nasty email.  Believe me.  Deservedly so.  Dude, I can't argue.  But if it comes from another comedian, I immediately get fucking violently annoyed. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Like, you fucking piece of shit.  Like, we're.  Yeah, we're working on the same.  I don't fuck with you.  Why are you fucking with me?  And that's probably how he felt.  If it was even that aggressive.  But he never fucked with me.  He never bad mouthed me.  He was never rude to me or did anything that deserved that.  As a comic.  He offended your eyes with that movie.  I didn't.  You know, doing a movie I don't like.  You know, he could watch my fucking movies and go, you stink.  And he's right. 
[00:47:00]  One line in Spider-Man.  It's just bothering me that I did that.  It's really fucking bothering me.  And I wish he wasn't so nice.  But anyone that's ever trashed somebody and then met them.  If they did something really trashing worthy and you meet them, fuck them.  But just because he did.  That's the only thing he's ever done was a movie I didn't like.  Maybe you'll get lucky.  He'll turn out to be a serial killer.  They'll discover that he has bodies buried.  But I was getting tweets from people and they're like, I tweeted, I said, Steve Martin called 
[00:47:30]  me out as he should have.  He was very nice.  I feel like a dick.  It wasn't a groveling tweet, but it was the truth.  And people were like, how did you not spit in his face?  I'm like, dude, he was nice.  Those people again.  I bet you didn't treat yourself.  Oh, I did.  You did.  But you only treat yourself when you feel like you did a good job.  Frozen yogurt.  Well, I felt the bit went well, considering all the people that didn't walk the carpet.  We didn't see Springsteen.  We didn't see Madonna.  We didn't see Gaga. 
[00:48:00]  We didn't see McCartney.  We didn't see any of those major, major celebrities because I think they just went in the side door.  They didn't stay.  They didn't fucking stop to talk to anybody.  Well, let's play another clip going into the break.  Norton at the Grammys for The Tonight Show.  Which one should we play?  We got Vince Gill, Dave Grohl, and The Civil Wars.  What do you like?  Vince Gill, Dave Grohl.  Was Grohl cool?  He was great.  Yeah, play the Grohl one.  It's really quick.  It's quick?  All right, we'll play this going into break. 
[00:48:30]  It's a visual, but it's...  It'll work?  Yeah.  It works?  All right.  Hold on.  Dave Grohl.  Dave Grohl.  Do it fast.  I'm getting yanked.  Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters.  How are you?  I'm really good.  How are you?  I took a picture with you one time and you licked my head.  I did?  Yes.  Can I lick it again?  I would like that.  Thank you, Dave, very much.  Have a great show.  Dave Grohl.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer. 
[00:49:00]  We used to rape Will Fouts just to make him break character.  Because he would never...  He dressed up as a character for like two straight weeks.  It was so annoying.  It was so annoying.  Because you're like, Will.  He's like, I'm not Will.  I'm Ron Burgundy.  All right, well, Ron, can we talk?  He's like, I'm busy this week with art.  And so this went on for weeks and weeks.  And Tracy, you can never pronounce his name right.  He called him Pharrell.  Will Pharrell.  Hey, Will Pharrell.  He'd be like, let's play characters and break Will Pharrell.  Let's rape him. 
[00:49:30]  Me, Colin Quinn, and Tracy repeatedly raped him.  Like, fake raped him for hours.  We'd leave him in a dumpster, take his clothes off.  And he would never break character.  It was so obnoxious.  Will would be...  Tracy would be in the doorway as we're fake rape.  As we're literally pulling his pants up, Tracy would be in the doorway with an unlit cigarette going,  hurry up and save me some of that.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  Saved message Sunday, 7.09 p.m. 
[00:50:00]  Hey, it's me.  I know what's wrong with me.  I mean, why am I crazy?  But I want to fucking...  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  I'm so fucking into you.  You're so fucking hot.  I want to lick your pussy.  And make you come.  And suck your tits.  I want to fucking...  Make you fucking crazy. 
[00:50:30]  Look at me and say yes.  I can't wait.  I don't want you, Daddy.  I know you want me.  Let's just fucking have fun.  If you get this message, just go to the bathroom and leave you a person out.  Bye. 
[00:51:00]  This is...  I want to...  I want to suck your pussy.  Fuck your, it's you.  Read off your face.  I'm a tyro hunter. 
[00:51:30]  I want to fucking lick your pussy.  I want to suck your tits.  If you agree with this, say yes.  But you have to be in the bathroom.  I told you that you're into her.  I want to fucking lick your pussy. 
[00:52:00]  And make you come so much.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  You got it.  Go to the bathroom and leave me a voice now.  Bye.  Sirius XM.  And now, The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here, check it out, The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:52:30]  Oh.  Are we getting topical?  This doesn't sound topical.  Not with this song, no.  Oh, what?  You decided to do a little topical thing later?  No, I did it right before we came back.  Oh.  We weren't listening.  That's okay.  What was it?  What was it, sexy?  Well, it's Pat O'Brien's birthday, so I played some of the calls and remixes that we used  to do with his phone sex audio.  Well, look how smart you are.  Oh, you're the fucking bees knees. 
[00:53:00]  Pat's 64.  Oh, Pat.  Pat O'Brien.  Our mayor's 70 today.  The big 7-0 from Michael Bloomberg.  She is?  She doesn't look a day over 50.  No.  Maybe it was someone who didn't like health care reform.  Very relevant point.  And an old friend of ours is 40 today.  The big 4-0 for Rob Thomas.  Oh, yeah?  Of Matchbox 20.  He knew him pretty well back in the D.  He's 40.  And Drew Bledsoe. 
[00:53:30]  Holy shit, he's only 40?  All right.  I had to think about that for a second.  I'm like, remember Drew Bledsoe?  Oh, yeah.  From our days in Boston?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue is out today.  Wow.  Is that still relevant?  No.  No.  Bunch of dumb cockies and bathing suits.  You could turn on fucking anything.  Look what you can see on them.  You can see big pussy bulges.  You can see shitting.  I don't want to see some fucking lady in a fucking bikini. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  It should be called Vava Voom.  I still like when they keep it classy.  That's terrible.  I still like it when it's a nice swimsuit.  There's nothing.  Are you totally nude?  Just something sexy.  That's not sexy to me.  Oh, look.  Angelica's frolicking by a seashell.  Is she?  I wish Joanne Vandersloot was fucking raping her with her face in the mud.  That I'd like to see.  Do we have an issue?  Do we have an issue?  No.  No, it's not.  I mean, they should put out the cover.  Oh, when does it come out? 
[00:54:30]  Today?  It has to come out today.  She has a lot of room between belly button and pussy.  Well, Kate Upton is on the cover.  You think?  Oh, my God.  She does.  What?  That's a huge amount of room.  Yeah, but the bottom part is the most of the...  Sam would actually get the picture instead of...  Come on, Sam.  Stop ruining it.  Oh, God.  You're queer.  Stop covering everything.  What are you doing?  It's got the blue, I want to copy the picture thing on it.  I'm copying things.  Look at all that real estate.  Yeah, but what they're doing there is the...  Painting.  The slit starts right there. 
[00:55:00]  Our bikini is very, very low cut.  Extremely low.  It's like, yeah, yeah.  If you pull that down a little bit, you would start seeing the lovely, lovely crevasse of vagina.  The lovely vagina crevasse.  I like how she's spilling out of her top.  Look at...  It's just spilling out to the side.  Are they real tits or fake things?  They're real.  She's only 19, Kate Upton.  Oh, that's nice.  I thought she was older.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Oh, really?  She looks really good, but she's 19 years old.  Kate Upton on the cover of Sports Illustrated. 
[00:55:30]  Hubba hubba.  That's lovely.  This broad is becoming really famous.  Yeah.  Within the last year, right?  That's what happens to.  She's, uh...  Yeah, what sports star is she fucking...  I don't know.  I think she just finger pops herself at night.  No, she's got to be going out of somebody.  Yeah.  What's the rumor?  Oh, Mark Sanchez.  What?  Sanchez can't handle that?  Mark Sanchez.  You just know Mark Sanchez can't handle that.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:56:00]  Damn.  You think he can handle that, eh?  No.  Of course not.  Can't fucking...  I don't know.  Maybe if he got the Jets to the Super Bowl, then I would go, okay, you can handle that.  Yeah, yeah, then he's deserving of that.  But after the season he had, he can't handle that.  He's not ready for that shit.  I know.  He's not ready for that.  Come on.  Come on.  Who are you kidding?  So that's all we have on Sports Illustrated.  You don't really like when they talk about frolicking on the beach and stuff, Jimmy? 
[00:56:30]  Frolicking.  No, just it's not...  Like, yeah, she's very pretty, but I hate the fact that the Sports Illustrated, the Illustrated  swimsuit edition, ooh, saucy.  Did you ever like it?  You're supposed to make people go like, oh, this is the one I gotta buy this year.  Yeah, in 1980.  Yeah, exactly.  I liked it, yeah.  How about 1992?  By then, I was already into such hardcore pornography.  Some fucking airbrushed dumbbell.  Go to 92.  I said that year specifically.  Oh, you did, did you? 
[00:57:00]  Hell fucking yeah.  What did they show in 92?  And she was in studio within the past year.  Really?  92 was Tyra Banks' year.  Was it?  I don't think so.  Oh, boy, did I get that wrong.  Who's 92?  Let's see that giant head.  The fuck did I read?  It wasn't you.  Is that Kathy Ireland?  Kathy Ireland.  She's hot, dude.  They're all hot.  I think that my father-in-law loves the Kathy Ireland.  Kathy Ireland?  Yeah.  92?  Remember her?  She was pretty hot.  They wouldn't put them in sexy poses. 
[00:57:30]  A little sand on their shoulders.  You just hate it, huh?  It stinks.  It's just corny.  It is corny.  Wait, look, I got 92.  What?  Tyra Banks, 1992.  That wasn't, when?  It's in the paper.  Yeah.  That wasn't 92, that was 97.  Ooh.  Oh, man, did they fuck up?  They did fuck up.  Someone.  Or.  It says Tyra Banks 92 to me.  Does it?  Yeah, look.  She didn't look like that in 92.  No.  Look at that, though.  My God. 
[00:58:00]  It's fine, but again.  They covered her forehead.  Making that a perfect picture.  Well, not perfect for Anne, I guess.  She's all greased up.  She doesn't even look black in that picture.  No.  She looks white.  Hubba hubba.  A little bit.  How about having a fucking black girl on the cover?  If you don't put a black girl on the cover, show a black girl.  Well, I think they have in the past, but it's mostly that kind of hybrid white-black thing.  Can you go to 1965, please?  65?  Yes.  There wasn't a swimsuit as you back then, was there?  I think it starred in 64, but look at 65. 
[00:58:30]  Look at that.  Good old Sue Peterson.  What her name?  Sue Peterson.  That's my Swedish, right?  She's got a bathing suit with a belt on.  It's a fucking...  It's horrible.  Just her sides are exposed.  It's a one-piece.  With the sides kind of cut out, so her hips and part of her rib cage is showing.  You think it was risky for the time, though?  Very, very.  And then... 
[00:59:00]  She had cleavage showing?  Yeah, but then they got a red belt and red suspenders.  What is she?  A fireman?  And she's frumpy.  She has her shoulders forward as she's walking down the beach.  Yeah.  A little frump.  What's her name?  Sue what?  Sue Peterson.  Yeah, it's like...  I bet she was a sexy stew.  I bet she was a stewardess on Pan American.  She has beefy shoulders, too.  She has fat shoulders.  Yeah.  And a long neck.  Yeah.  And a head like Pia Zadora.  She does look a little Nordic. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  What about...  Remember Cheryl Teague's with the fishnet?  Cheryl Teague's...  That shit got you going, right?  That got the juices flowing.  That was a popular swimsuit issue edition.  I love the swimsuit issue growing up.  That might have been the one that really put the swimsuit issue over the top.  You think?  The Cheryl Teague's.  Yeah, because she was wearing that netting and you saw her nipples right through it.  Yeah, they just said, fuck it.  We need to see your nipples.  Oh, that was sexy.  I don't think they've shown nipples since.  Nipples are now taboo again. 
[01:00:00]  What's going on there?  Leaving a little to the imagination.  Oh.  Cheryl Teague's.  I don't need the...  My imagination is what I'm jerking off with.  I want to...  Look at that awful bottom covering her pussy.  That is terrible.  It's like, let's put this here to just cover the pussy.  I like where that girl's covered up a little bit.  You need nude all the time.  No, but I like to see her tits and pussy.  She can wear finger gloves.  Fingerless gloves.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't need mystery.  I know what's under there.  It's a pussy.  My pussy. 
[01:00:30]  No.  I don't always need them totally nude.  But I like sexy.  I like the nipples showing through that.  That's hot.  Yeah.  But that giant fucking awful bottom covering the pussy is horrendous.  She has a period.  And the...  Yeah, she's got a maxi pad on.  And the fact that the leg holes are so low on her hips...  You don't like that?  You know?  It's got to come up a little more.  You don't like that?  No.  It looks old lady-ish.  Yeah.  It's all about the hips.  No. 
[01:01:00]  Got to show the hips.  No.  All right.  Well, not much excitement for the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.  It's on the front page of all the papers, though.  Old news.  Old hat.  Look, 1964, it was A Skin Diver's Guide to the Caribbean.  That's how they started out.  A Skin Diver.  What is that fucking James Bond?  Fun in the Sun.  Ah.  On Cozumel.  Look at her.  That was the first cover right there.  Oh, that's actually sexier than the second one.  No, why?  Because those boy shorts or whatever they're called came back. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, they came back.  That look came back.  She's skin diving.  Look at her nice abs.  Smiling at something.  Hey, teehee!  She's laughing.  You look like Joyce DeWitt.  Teehee!  Yeah, she does.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of just, I think it's a nostalgic thing.  Who really runs out to buy it?  Oh, it's the swimsuit issue.  Oh, boy.  Well, let's make sure we get a copy.  For tomorrow, maybe?  Let me turn my computer.  Let me turn my computer off that has fucking just hardcore fucking animal pornography on it. 
[01:02:00]  And look at these girls in bikinis.  Yeah, let's see that girl in the bikini.  Let's go to the computer and see what a girl who looks like her looks like with a goat shitting in her mouth.  She's really cute.  I love to see her laying under a horse, putting a wrench in her vagina.  Let's go find that.  Yeah.  I saw some video where a girl was jerking off under a horse, and the horse kicked her in the shoulder. 
[01:02:30]  It was really great.  Fucking horses don't know.  Insult to injury.  Yeah.  Have your pussy stunk.  What drives a girl to fucking do that, huh?  I guess they get pissed off if you try to jerk them off, huh?  No, she's masturbating herself.  Oh, oh, oh.  Under the horse.  She wasn't jerking off the horse.  Oh, oh, oh.  His horse penis.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Hey, no surprise, but Bill Donahue is obviously upset over Nicki Minaj's Grammy performance.  Wow, is he as bored with it as I was?  That sucked.  That was terrible.  We said yesterday, it just didn't seem to have even a point.  Yeah, it was silly.  It looked like she was trying way too hard to get some kind of controversy going to get, 
[01:03:00]  you know, the country talking about her.  Exactly.  More fake edge.  I guess Bill Donahue has to say something, but I would have just left this one alone if I was him.  Yeah.  It was corny.  Because now you're sort of bringing a little more attention to it.  It was going away quickly.  People were like, what was that?  What were you doing?  And the song stunk.  I'm really trying to like Nicki Minaj.  Why?  Why are you trying?  Because I kind of liked her when I first heard her.  What song do you like by her?  Do you know?  The Monster one was okay.  But she, you know, I can't even do her voice. 
[01:03:30]  But her songs have, the rhythm is awful.  And they always go into some weird beat.  It's hard to enjoy her.  And I'm trying.  Yeah, she's got a huge fan base.  She does.  Huge.  But it doesn't matter.  Adele was great.  Yeah, we said it yesterday.  I mean, whatever.  Adele.  She's good, man.  Adele.  Call us what you have to, but that's an amazing fucking voice.  And her songs are great.  Would they call us queers for a second?  Probably.  Yeah.  Probably. 
[01:04:00]  I know I would, man.  Because, you know, that show's a little too soft.  Too much of a soft side.  She's good, man.  Don't you spit on her face, dude?  What are you, a faggot?  That Rolling in the Deep song is just ridiculous.  And she's got, what, four or five songs now that we know?  Easily?  Yeah, I think she's had three big singles off of this album, and then she had one before.  What are the other big singles besides Rolling in the Deep?  Someone Like You was really big.  Yeah, that was a slow one.  I think Jim would like that.  How's that go?  I'm not impressed with that song, like Rolling in the Deep. 
[01:04:30]  Rolling in the Deep really shows off her voice.  The other one, she slows it down.  It's nice.  And then the new one is, I think it's called Set Fire to the Rain.  Do we know that one?  Yeah.  I mean, it's getting very big.  The point, fire to the rain?  What does that even mean?  Yeah, you can't set fire to the rain.  The matches keep going out.  I used to try to burn dogs.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, now he's a budding serial killer.  This is Set Fire to the Rain.  Sounds like Amy Winehouse a little bit, huh? 
[01:05:00]  Yep.  Why does E-Rock always play the music low?  Because he looks like Adele.  Oh.  That's a great fat joke that Timmy and Cormway.  Just for the sake of making the fat joke.  But there's a sight to you that I never knew, never knew all the things you'd say. 
[01:05:30]  They were never true, never true in the games you played.  You would always win, always win.  But I set fire to the rain.  I like it.  What?  The whole album is good.  Fuck.  You didn't love it.  I did.  We talked about her yesterday.  When she opens her mouth, though, she sounds horrendous. 
[01:06:00]  Hello, hello.  Yeah.  Oh, it's fucking Mary Poppins here.  Oh, chitty, chitty, bang, bang.  How's that the same person?  I love it that she's just fucking, like, British trash.  Yeah.  Her teeth are barely holding on.  She's a disaster.  You know it's only a few years before you're going to start noticing some rottage.  Yeah.  You haven't heard someone like you?  Yeah, you know someone like you.  Is that off the first album?  No, I don't.  I'm just me, man.  It's off this one. 
[01:06:30]  So what's off the first album that we know?  I don't remember.  I mean...  Ooh, who's tickling those ivories here?  Who's tickling those ivories?  It's E-Rock in there.  He's just playing.  E-Rock with a blonde wig on would kind of look like Adele.  That's right.  A doll meets Adele.  Married now, I heard that your dreams came true. 
[01:07:00]  Guess she gave you things.  I don't know.  There's something annoying about her.  I'm chasing pavements.  I know what you don't like about her.  Huh?  What?  Chasing pavements.  She's heavy.  Giant single off the line.  And she's white.  And she sings what might be considered in a black style.  No, I wouldn't mistake her as being a black artist.  Oh, I so did at first.  Really?  I just thought she was a sexy black singer.  I've said it a million times. 
[01:07:30]  I was really surprised when I saw what she looked like.  So full.  If she's so good, I would give her an award.  I wish she sounds like Adele.  But remember Beth Hart from back in the day?  She sounds like a cleaned up version of Beth Hart, who had an amazing voice.  Didn't do that well.  In the industry, but.  Yeah, you know this one.  Her voice is fucking smooth, man.  Oh, yeah.  Do you think this is a wedding song? 
[01:08:00]  Oh, fuck, yeah.  I want to get married just to play it.  But only in Massachusetts.  You know what I mean?  Oh, now Jersey.  Oh.  It's like Jersey just passed it, right?  Finally gave in.  What do we got on that?  Chris Christie.  It's a breakup song, though.  I hope people play it without paying attention.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, but if it's slow, people don't know.  They just think it's a nice love song.  They don't listen to the words. 
[01:08:30]  Most people don't listen to the words.  It's a breakup song?  Yeah.  New Jersey Senate passed the same-sex marriage bill, 24 to 16.  Good.  So there you go.  You don't have to go to Massachusetts, Jeremy.  Rick Sanchez is attacking heavy metal now.  Who is?  Rick Santorum.  I'm sorry.  Rick Sanchez.  He's an idiot.  Was that real, though?  I Googled it.  It was in a lot.  He's an idiot.  I hope it was real.  It looked like it was too fucking ironic.  Oh, you know what?  I don't think that was real. 
[01:09:00]  I don't think he's that smart.  These guys aren't that smart and clever.  And can we point out that his daughter looks like a tranny, or are we going to get in trouble  for saying that?  You say what you want to say.  She's in the background when he's doing his speeches, and she looks like him in a wig.  Let me see what she looks like, Sam Feiner, before I beat her death.  How old is she, though?  And, Ant, this is your fucking world.  Are you worried?  Why do you always peg me with these people?  Because you're the Republican.  And you have trannies.  I said, I'm like, yeah.  And you have a lot to say about Obama. 
[01:09:30]  I'm just wondering where you're at.  I would vote for anybody.  I don't care how bad they are.  Because now he's got momentum, but, I mean, can he beat Obama?  No.  No.  No.  But they're not happy with Romney totally yet.  But it is a two-man race.  Newt Gingrich is done, huh?  I've got to wait until everybody's fucking done with this shit.  Yeah.  And it's between, you know, Obama and whoever.  At least he has a nice, at least he doesn't have a cheesy smile.  That's good.  Oh, God.  That fucking awful.  He has a head like a time capsule. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, boy.  You know, my son plays with that Mr. Potato Head.  Oh.  He kind of has that type of vibe to him.  Mr. Potato Head without, like, I don't know, the eyebrows or something.  That's just a toy that kind of, right through time, just doesn't matter how many years go  by, Mr. Potato Head is still a popular little item.  Oh, God.  I had an incident yesterday.  A toilet overflowed because he stuffed a lot of shit in it.  Two inches of water in the bathroom.  I forgot to mention this.  What did he put in the toilet? 
[01:10:30]  Everything.  And we thought we got it all out.  Oh, boy.  And then I flushed as I was leaving the house.  Me and the wife were leaving for, like, a little bit.  Oh, boy.  And he was back in the house with some people.  And I literally flushed the toilet, jumped down the elevator.  By the time I got in the cab, I'm getting a phone call from the house.  Holy shit, you got to get back here.  Oh, man.  So from the time I got in the elevator to the cab, the toilet overflowed and was just pouring water. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, man.  Not just a little.  You know how you overflow your toilet every once in a while?  And it's like, oh, come on.  Really?  Just flying out.  I don't even understand this.  Two inches of water in the bathroom.  And then taking over his room, basically, was the water.  We're still drying it out as I sit here.  Oh, man.  Humidifier, those big blowers, one of those wet vacs.  Wasn't there the valve?  Huh?  Did you shut the valve?  Oh, yeah, immediately.  But by the time anyone discovered it, that's how much water flooded. 
[01:11:30]  Two inches in the bathroom alone.  I'm scared about the apartment below me.  Oh, you think it might have.  And there's a big star that lives below me.  A big star.  I hope she doesn't sue me for water damage.  Big star?  Big star.  Ooh.  Kathleen Turner lives below me.  Oh, boy.  I pray that there's not my toilet water dripping into her fucking living room.  You ever hear her having cougar sex down there? 
[01:12:00]  Nah.  She's actually really cool.  Oh, yeah?  She's really, really, really nice.  You say hi to her?  Yeah.  How often do you see the bitch?  I probably see her, like, maybe once a month in the elevator.  Going up.  What do you say?  Just small talk.  Hey.  She likes my kid.  She likes the kid.  She chit-chat?  Yeah, a little chit-chat.  I never know what to say.  I always try to joke.  I'll be like, oh, boy, we'll get in the elevator.  I go, oh, boy, the ups and downs this thing has.  That's a good one. 
[01:12:30]  That is a good one, though.  Oh, God.  You know what I like to say?  What?  I want the elevator to go.  It's amazing how many rapes are committed on these things.  Jesus.  It's just you and a woman.  Yeah.  He's just staring at the door, praying for it to open.  That sucks, though, when that toilet overflows, huh?  Yeah.  It's just panic-inducing, yeah.  But why all the water? 
[01:13:00]  I don't get it.  I don't know.  Well, for some reason, the little ball valve didn't re-engage there, and they put the flapper.  The little flapper thing didn't close over the...  Then one of the maintenance guys is in there with a snake, and he goes, whatever's in there...  It's cock.  But he goes, what's ever in there?  It sounded like at the start of a horror movie.  He goes, what's ever in there just took my snake.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  What?  What's in the pipes?  And then he just came out with this massive, massive wad.  Of what? 
[01:13:30]  I like tissue paper, and I don't know.  What was he throwing in, like toys, or was he throwing in like paper goods?  He filled up the whole toilet with everything, but I think he was also throwing some of those wipes in there.  Why do kids like doing that?  Because those wipes don't disintegrate.  Why do kids like doing that shit?  I don't know.  It's fun.  They don't know any better.  Their brains are still getting itself together.  To them, they're probably thinking they're making a Picasso painting or something.  Oh, yeah, it's very important.  That's like their work.  That's like them going, ah, fuck. 
[01:14:00]  I got to throw shit in the toilet today.  Ah, damn it.  You know, I learned something about parenting, though.  Because when you see your kid doing mundane shit, you just want him to stop because it looks ridiculous.  And then someone actually pulled me aside and go, no, let him do it.  To him, it's everything.  To him, he's doing Mozart or whatever the fuck you want to say.  Obviously, you know, it's just him piling dumb shit up or taking the pots and pans out of the drawer and then trying to make something out of it.  And usually, I'm like, just fucking put the pots and pans. 
[01:14:30]  No, let him do it.  That's his artistic.  To him, it's everything.  And I didn't understand that at first.  I'm like, because I'd rather him do stuff that makes sense to me, I guess.  Do a little coloring or I don't know.  Where are we at?  Where are we at?  There was something.  Oh, the Bill Donahue, so.  Bill.  I didn't like the song.  I thought the little promotional piece around it was terrible and corny.  Yeah, it was like the start of The Exorcist.  Oh, there's a devil lady here.  Watch out. 
[01:15:00]  Devil lady.  But she was doing like the black exorcist.  Devil lady.  The black lady gaga.  What was she doing?  It was horrible lip syncing shit.  That was lip syncing, you think?  Yeah, definitely.  Of course it was.  Yeah, it was.  Did Springsteen lip sync?  Hell no.  Oh, did McCartney?  No.  Hell no.  Did the Foo Fighters?  No.  Hell no.  Just these fucking cornball rappers.  Adele didn't lip sync.  Of course she didn't lip sync.  Of course she didn't. 
[01:15:30]  Who else didn't lip sync, you think?  Katy Perry?  There had to be a little lip syncing in there, right?  I think Katy Perry was probably lip syncing.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Pop singers fucking blow.  Whenever they're moving around too much, you know they're not singing.  It's very difficult.  Do both.  How about you learn how to do both or you don't do?  Right.  Lady Gaga did a strikingly similar performance a couple years ago and she did not lip sync.  No, she didn't.  She's fucking great.  Well, you are a big Gaga fan.  I am too.  Lady Gaga got shut out this year, though.  Well, she was just nominated.  It wasn't her year.  She got shut out. 
[01:16:00]  She was sitting there just hoping and nothing happened.  At least she wore a black veil, though, respectfully.  Exactly.  Oh, God.  I'm making it by you.  That's right.  At least she wasn't being a devil lady.  A devil lady.  Oh, no.  There's the devil here.  Get out of the way.  Did you see the big red hood when you were out there for Leno?  No, but we saw the priest.  I'm like, what the fuck is that?  We didn't notice stupid Nicki Minaj in her outfit.  But she was, there was two red carpets.  There's a red carpet and then there's like a wall.  Like a kind of a wall that you could section off.  You could see.  Yeah.  And there's people who don't want to talk to the press or behind that. 
[01:16:30]  Like she walked there.  She didn't talk to the press.  Really?  She's too big for that?  No, it's because I think a lot of them didn't want to talk because of the witness death.  Oh.  Let's hear this.  Thank you for coming, Father.  He's upstairs.  He's not well.  He's sick.  We didn't know where else to tell him.  It's not long enough.  I'm in, Father.  Shining music.  Where is the child?  But everyone was saying ahead of time that this is the performance we'll be talking about 
[01:17:00]  the next day.  Oh, really?  I mean, you're talking about it.  I guess.  But I think she was hoping for more.  You can stop laughing.  Probably like, you're not supposed to be laughing.  Are they supposed to be laughing at this?  Probably not.  Because they're fucking laughing.  She thinks she's giving a real performance.  Oh, yeah.  She went to acting school.  Did she?  To be a devil lady?  Oh, that's good.  I want to be devilishly good. 
[01:17:30]  Holy shit.  When does the song start?  Right now, I think the man talks to her.  And then what happens?  She starts rapping.  She's up on the ceiling.  What the fuck is this shit?  She's not singing there. 
[01:18:00]  No.  No.  This is just nonsense. 
[01:18:30]  I'm starting to hate her voice inflection.  I'm going to be frantic.  I hate this.  She's a good rapper, but I hate her voice.  I hate her.  I hate her.  I hate her.  I like the hook a little bit, but wrestling is nonsense.  You're being okay.  She's not a Catherine Hepburn.  Norman.  Medication, Norman. 
[01:19:00]  Take your medication, Norman.  There's so much you can take.  You can take.  So how about you in your building?  Oh, take your medication, Norman.  And it kind of likes it.  You kind of like it, huh?  That is so bad.  Oh, call him a...  Looks like fucking Temple of Doom.  Sure it does.  Roman is Nicki Minaj's alter ego, you understand.  Ew.  Just, what is this, WWE?  Yeah.  She should be Roman in traffic. 
[01:19:30]  Thanks.  That's terrible.  I'd rather have heard Whitney fucking gargling.  Spitting up fucking bubble suns.  Oh, God.  Scrubbing bubbles.  Look at...  I'd rather hear that gravy boat fall off and tinging on the floor.  The ting of a gravy boat.  Take your medication, Roman.  That's so stupid.  It's a Roman holiday.  Okay.  Roman holiday. 
[01:20:00]  Is it the double meaning?  No.  Maybe we're just too old.  A Roman's a vomit thing from a dominatrix.  Why don't we just admit we're too old to understand this shit?  I like young people.  You do?  I mean, I enjoy it.  I like Taylor Swift's song.  It was great.  Yeah, why?  How old is she?  Fucking three?  I loved her song.  She's taller than that.  How great was she?  Did Sandusky say that?  I like young people.  Yeah, that's right.  When asked if he, you know, was sexually attracted to children.  Touched her legs.  Hear about Sandusky?  What happened?  Judge allows Jerry Sandusky to visit some of his grandchildren while awaiting trial. 
[01:20:30]  So, what?  Are they deciding which grandchildren could take a meeting with Jerry Sandusky?  The least fuckable grandchildren.  Yeah, the ugly thing.  They're going to just let the ugly ones.  There's a fat redhead.  It looks like McQuarrie.  All right, what do you do to him?  His dick won't get hard.  But only some he'll be allowed to see.  What is that about?  Do we have info on that?  Maybe at a certain age.  Yeah.  We lost another guy to Twitter. 
[01:21:00]  Got to defend these fucking people, man.  What?  Yeah, we got a guy from, what was this, Fox Sports, Jimmy?  Yep.  Jason Whitlock, I think, tweeted a joke after the Nick game.  He was a Fox Sports guy.  He tweeted a joke.  Oh, hold on.  Travis, you had more on Sandusky?  He came running down the hall.  There's two.  Dr. Gay!  Hi, Doc.  Dr. Gay!  Call him.  Dr. Gay!  I'm Dr. Gay.  I have something to say.  Oh, here he goes.  You done?  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  You done?  Mm-mm.  I'm like, guys.  There's two grandchildren that I think his daughter didn't want him to see.  So those two are part of like a different kind of court case.  So he's allowed to Skype and talk on the phone with all of them, but he's only allowed to  see, I think, what does he have, 14, 12 of the 14 grandchildren or something?  Wait, so his own daughter is like, hell no, don't see my kids. 
[01:22:00]  Hang on.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, he's allowed to meet with 11 of his 14 grandchildren.  The remaining three were deferred to a judge overseeing their parents' divorce as their  mother, Sandusky's daughter-in-law, objected to the request.  Wow.  Daughter-in-law, sure.  She doesn't want him sticking his fucking jerry dick all over the town.  No, who would?  Look at Kate Upton.  Holy fuck, they got video of her moving around now.  Oh, look, there she is by that seashell. 
[01:22:30]  How do you not like that, Jimmy?  Because what is, she's sexy.  Oh, look, she's on a rock.  Wow, when she moves around, that makes it even more titty.  Exactly, but it just, it just bores me.  It's like, I know she has great tits.  I'm lying.  But there's so many sexier things than her with her, she'll lean back on the rock, and  her hair will be blowing in the breeze.  Yes.  And there'll be some sea foam on her tootsies.  Oh, there's some sand on my shoulder.  Oh, wiggle, wiggle.  Some sea foam on my tootsies. 
[01:23:00]  Sea foam.  Can you say a Caribbean breeze?  It sounds better.  There's a Caribbean breeze in my hair.  It's some sea foam on my tootsies.  Please come and wipe the sea foam off my tootsies.  Oh, look, a piece of seaweed's caught in my toenail.  Oh, look, there's an urchin in my vagina.  That's not sexy.  A little sea foam.  I love it, man.  I smell of condom.  Where you at, Travis?  You like that shit?  What?  Kate Upton?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's great.  And the sportsdills can swim suit?  Come on.  I mean, that's been irrelevant for many years. 
[01:23:30]  At least five years?  Maybe ten years?  They would just put guys in it.  Right.  Okay, you did a whole AJ Poopy shits routine.  Don't just turn it around on me.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's harsh.  Oh, shit.  All right, back to the Twitter guy.  So what do we got, Jimmy?  The guy tweeted what?  I don't have it in front of me.  After the game between, I believe, the Lakers, when they lost to the Knicks, he tweeted something  about Jeremy Lin, but I think he just goes, some girl in New York should be getting a  couple of inches tonight.  Yeah.  A couple inches of pain tonight.  Well, the fact is, in general, Asians have small dicks. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  They do.  Oh, boy.  And he got fired for that.  He also is one of the black guys.  He thought Imus was a hack.  He didn't like him, but he defended him.  He did defend him.  He did defend him.  And he's a guy who's not, he doesn't seem like a PC guy, so of course he was fired.  Yeah, the exact tweet.  Some lucky lady in New York City is going to feel a couple inches of pain tonight.  It's the Asian special interest groups who will go after black talent.  That's pretty goddamn funny.  And they fucking fired him.  The guy's making a joke on Twitter.  Come on, people.  Come on. 
[01:24:30]  What are you doing?  What's wrong with that?  What's fucking wrong with that?  It's a good joke.  Silly.  There's no hate in there.  Where's the hate in there?  Seriously.  Where's the hate?  I imagine Jeremy Lin hates his penis.  What if he's packing?  Well, then he's...  Never know.  It might be an anomaly.  What if he's packing?  Loving the Jeremy Lin phenomenon.  Loving it.  You're not a basketball guy, Jimmy, so you don't really care, huh?  I am.  I'm looking forward to meeting one of the Globetrotters today.  He's 7'8".  7'8".  That's crazy.  We're meeting a 7'8 guy today. 
[01:25:00]  I forgot to mention that.  Yeah, he's a big guy.  He's like a monster.  Well, Kareem was 7'2".  Yeah.  This guy's a half a foot taller than that.  That's crazy.  I got a couple great lines already.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's it like always brushing your head against the clouds?  What?  Why are you talking like that?  It sounds cool.  Great.  It's 7'8".  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  John Jones is sending in, so we could break.  On a tinkle. 
[01:25:30]  Sure.  Oh, so that's all we got on Jason?  They just fired him?  What was the reasoning?  Did they give an official statement?  I imagine they just felt it was inappropriate.  It's too bad, because this Twitter thing was really cool when it started.  It allowed people to really just express themselves out there.  You know, famous people, celebrities.  Yeah.  People just in the media in general.  And now everyone's going to just shut down and lock up.  They're not going to take chances on Twitter.  Because of the dumb companies they work for, exactly.  We got two in one week that Twitter was their downfall. 
[01:26:00]  We don't know what's happening.  We're Roland, what's his name?  Roland Martin from CNN.  They haven't officially fired him, but I don't know if he's coming back anytime soon for what he tweeted.  When people begin defending and begin boycotting the networks because they're firing talent, they'll stop doing it.  Until then, people will continue to get fired.  All it takes is one of these companies to just say, look, we're not firing our guy.  Yeah, we're not firing him.  And then guess what?  Now what?  The power of the special interest groups gets a little weaker.  I agree.  And you do that a few times, guess what?  They go the fuck away. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  The special interest groups are not helping anyone out in this society in the end.  They're just not.  It's too bad for Jason Whitlock.  But he did defend Imus.  His opinion, he didn't like what Imus said, but defended his right to say it, I guess.  No.  So that's fair enough, right?  That's all you want.  Yeah.  All right.  Jon Jones next.  He's promoting UFC 3 Undisputed.  Available today on Xbox and PS3.  Very excited to see Jon Jones again.  He's a good guest, man.  And a great fighter, obviously. 
[01:27:00]  Yep.  And he's got a big fight coming up.  Well, it's going to be a little while still.  April, I think?  I was a fighter.  Yes.  We'll talk to him.  A former governor.  Mm-hmm.  You're listening to the O.P. and Anthony Channel on SiriusXM.  Oh, fuck.  What the hell's going on here? 
[01:27:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful people.  For some patients, the ability to communicate is not an option.  A look over would be like some 80-year-old woman with her legs spread.  But one man is about to change their lives forever.  Did someone say something?  For the terminally ill who live in darkness. 
[01:28:00]  What the fuck is that?  Dr. Anthony Cumia.  Who said that?  Has found a way to bring light to the remaining days on Earth.  Your ass talked to me.  Using a rare gift he never knew he had.  Oh, my God.  What have I done?  He'll learn to love those he never knew existed.  I think I know what you're going for.  Where you're going for sexy, you're coming off as whiny.  O&A Pictures.  What a hot voice that is.  And Depends Undergarments.  I love it.  Present a true story. 
[01:28:30]  You're an ass.  Of one man's inability to distinguish a voice from a fart.  You're talking out your ass.  The Ass Whisperer.  Coming soon.  Oh, stop it.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, we're rocking.  Let's say hi to Jon Jones.  Of course, from the UFC. 
[01:29:00]  Current champion.  The light heavyweight champion.  What's up, Jon Jones?  Welcome back to the show.  Thanks for having me.  Jonny Bones on Twitter, by the way.  Jonny Bones.  Jonny Bones, no H.  What's up, everyone?  Hangin'.  Hello.  Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, please, no.  Yeah, if you recall, people, this gentleman kicked Jimmy Norton.  Oh, did he get me going?  And regrets not kicking him?  Oh, good kick.  You thought that was a good one?  Well, I mean, in the sense that two weeks later I had a knee brace on. 
[01:29:30]  Because I'll tell you what happened.  I was favoring it.  And I was favoring it.  And this is what an old lady I am.  I got into bed.  I was doing a gig, and it was the Friday night shows were done.  So I get into bed.  And you know how you kneel and flip into bed and roll into bed?  I twisted the knee.  I thought I'm going to have to get surgery.  Uh-oh.  Because I was favoring it.  I'm fine.  You know how classic that is?  These guys, when they're in the, I was going to say the ring, you know, the cage, their body parts are being twisted in all sorts of ways.  And they don't have to wear braces afterwards. 
[01:30:00]  Every time I look at a leg kick, I'm like that old.  Because we're not.  Pussies.  That would be a very valid reason.  But in all fairness to the video, you know, we all knew he was only going to hit you, what, 10% maybe?  That felt like 90.  That was about 30.  That was about 30.  You did 30.  Nice.  That was about 30.  35-ish.  Wow.  But you didn't have a bruise, I don't think.  No, it didn't bruise because I kept massaging it.  They told me to massage.  I get a massage.  You know how awful it is to have a massage therapist, and you know where you want her to go, but you're like, could you massage my leg first?  I was kicked by a champion that removes the sexy from the room. 
[01:30:30]  So, yeah, the legs, no more leg stuff.  Someone was Twittering today, they're like, I just want to put you in a heel hook.  I'm like, no.  How about no?  What's wrong with you?  I won't do that.  How about no?  No.  Because I've been, Brock put me in one, and they really, they're very painful.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  They're very painful.  You're here.  We should at least mention that UFC 3 comes out today, I think, right?  Oh, yeah.  The game is out, man.  And it is fun, I tell you what.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I've been playing it nonstop.  Are you good at it?  As myself.  Playing with myself.  Nonstop. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, I'm good at it.  I'm not good, like, online, because there's some kids out there who's already mastered every combination and every guard pass and everything.  But I'm doing these.  I'm doing these.  I bet you want to meet some of those kids and go, all right, really?  Do you really want to play?  Yeah, exactly.  It's funny.  I was playing it in front of my old lady, and I had gotten knocked out, but, like, I don't know, it was, like, Chuck Liddell or something.  And, like, you know, she's never seen me get knocked out before, so she's like, just to see it in a video game, the graphics all look so real.  She's like, oh, that gave me the chills. 
[01:31:30]  I don't want to see that anymore.  Yeah, the graphics are great, man.  Oh, yeah.  They look amazing.  Looks like you're, you know, you could turn it on and think you're watching an actual fight.  An actual fight, yeah.  What I love the most is that they gave me a little extra muscle, and, you know.  Oh, okay.  I really don't have any chest, and now I have, you know, double Ds.  I think Jimmy has said he's, like, trying to search out some of these videos online of real fights, and then it's a fight from one of these games, and he gets confused.  Was it people that I never knew?  This is how dumb I am.  John Jones versus George Foreman. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, I didn't know they fought, and I'll open it up, and it's, like, literally a graphics fight, but I've done it on a lot of UFC fights where I don't know that they're not real fights until I open up the...  Yeah, because people put some of the better, you know, fights online, obviously.  We usually have the game.  I don't know why we don't have it today to check it out.  Oh, man.  Have they upped the graphics since 2?  Yeah, the game looks great.  Yeah.  It's awesome.  Because we like 2.  It's funny.  You know, I had a fan hit me up recently through Twitter, and he's like, hey, John, I put you versus Rampage in simulation mode, you know, like, five or ten times. 
[01:32:30]  Now, and you won, you know, eight times out of ten or whatnot, so I'm really confident that you should win the fight.  I'm like, oh, well, thank you.  Then why do we have to fight?  Yeah, exactly.  The video game shows you.  Yeah, exactly.  So Rampage is your next one.  Are you fighting him?  Oh, no, no.  I'm done.  I fought Rampage.  Yeah, yeah, no.  Lioto.  Oh, who are you fighting next?  Rashad.  I meant Rashad.  I meant Rashad.  You know what?  Rashad didn't...  I don't know as much as Bob Kelly who's outside the studio and Jimmy, but Rashad didn't look that impressive.  Nah, dude.  He didn't, right?  Nah, his body was all loose. 
[01:33:00]  No offense to any of you guys.  His body.  We just have to take it to him.  What are you going to do?  How much does that suck?  I mean, what are you going to do, really?  I know.  It's just...  You can see what I want.  I hate it.  I hate the imposition.  But he knows.  There's really not much we can do.  But I think we're...  It's a valid point.  I think Rashad Evans was disappointed because he wanted to knock him out, obviously, to show you a thing or two.  Absolutely.  Yeah, finishing the fight is definitely really impressive.  And, you know, not finishing a fight against a guy who's had nine fights, it's just not impressive. 
[01:33:30]  You know?  So, obviously, you've got to respect the guy.  He's the number two ranked guy in the world.  So, he has great qualities.  He's a great combatant.  But at a certain level, you know, there just has to be a certain level of perfection and performance to consider yourself a world champion.  And I just...  I didn't feel it from him.  But you're not going to let your guard down, obviously.  No way.  I just assume.  No way.  You're not that type of guy, obviously.  Absolutely not.  You know, I can respect the guy.  And, you know, maybe I seem like I'm putting him down.  But I'm just real when it comes to martial art and what I see.  Yeah. 
[01:34:00]  Either it's good or not.  Like a brutal artist or designer or something.  You just can't tell the truth.  But I definitely wouldn't look past him.  We've talked to a lot of you guys now.  And I love your honesty.  I really do.  Do you get in trouble for your honesty sometimes when it gets back to some of these guys?  Uh, no.  No, not at all.  You know, yeah, there's a lot of feelings being hurt.  You know, I've had guys make bold statements about me.  I make statements about other people.  But as long as they're legit, you know, the fans can tell if you're just being a jerk or if there's like sincerity.  It's refreshing, though. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, it's refreshing.  To hear what you guys really think.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, oh, no, we're all...  Cliché answers.  Yeah, I hate that.  Who knew what Sean just fought?  They went the distance.  Phil Davis.  Oh, it was Phil Davis, right.  Yeah, live on Fox.  And, yeah, he couldn't...  Phil hung in there, man.  But could that have been just a ring rust?  Just because he hasn't fought in a while?  You know, it's hard to tell.  You know, Phil Davis was undefeated.  Phil Davis is a Division I national wrestling champion in college.  So he wasn't up against a total fish, you know.  But as a martial artist, the guy was so green.  You know, you just finish fights like that.  Right.  So it's hard to tell. 
[01:35:00]  So maybe it was a combination of Rashad, slight ring rust, and just what he was up against  in an undefeated fighter.  And what is the...  People keep saying, well, you know, you and him used to train together, and he knows things  about you, which also you know things about him, I think, last time you said that.  But does he really present more of a threat to you than some of the other guys who've never  fought you?  You know, there's a possibility, but, you know, I'm very optimistic, and I think us  training together will play, you know, bigger dividends for me than for him.  You know, when I was training with him, you know, I was kind of impressed. 
[01:35:30]  You know, I'm fighting with Rashad Evans.  I was the new guy.  I was the young kid, you know.  So I remember every practice, you know.  I remember moves and things that landed and combinations of things.  So I gained so much knowledge fighting him.  Where he gained knowledge fighting me, you know, I've changed so much since those days.  You know, my kickboxing has quadrupled, and my level of understanding in the octagon, my  Kate Savvy has increased tremendously.  So I really think that people will see us training together. 
[01:36:00]  It was a way better advantage for me.  And what about in the last fight?  Like, Machida, it was a tough fight.  Like, he's a really weird, unorthodox style of fighting.  Yeah, he is.  He's an odd...  It's like he just...  He almost looks like he's in his...  Like, he lunges, but he's really accurate.  And he's a very tough dude.  And he seemed like he hit you harder than you have been hitting you.  Hey, man, watch your mouth, man.  Well, no.  But he did seem to hit you harder, but it...  But you didn't let me finish, Mr. Jones.  I was going to say, and the lack of effect it had on you was stunning. 
[01:36:30]  All of his might meant nothing.  No, but he seemed like he hit you pretty hard on a couple of shots.  Yeah, no, Machida, he was a tough dude.  He was hard to figure out.  The biggest thing is that I've never gone against, like, a formal karate guy.  And this is a guy who's been through the white belt system.  Now it's a, you know, fourth-degree black belt, and he trains karate every day.  So there's some really fast and unorthodox, tricky combinations that I just am not familiar with.  So I was really hesitant because, you know, you train, you know, three months, two months, you know, four times a day.  You know, you don't want to give it up for being, you know, overexcited or jumping into things. 
[01:37:00]  So I just took my time and felt him out.  And I think I won the whole filling-up process.  I'm laughing because look what's going on behind it.  Hi, how are you?  Oh, did you bring, did you bring, oh, you ordered some breakfast?  Yeah, I was hungry.  Hi, how are you?  Well, thank you.  Bob Kelly is a huge fan of yours, sir.  Hey, hey, where's my green M&M's?  Oh, man.  Be quick about it.  Wait, where are your green M&M's?  Sit down, Bob.  Sit down, Bob. 
[01:37:30]  Stay a while.  Stay a while.  Nice hat.  What are you auditioning for?  Newsies?  Bobby's a comic.  Very funny comic, John.  I'm a big fan.  And a big fan of UFC and you.  Appreciate it.  I'll just say this on the air because I did say it.  We met you.  Me and Jim met you.  I think it was UFC 100.  Jim and I.  Jim and I.  No, I don't care.  Jim and I.  Your audience is going to correct this.  Wait, UFC 100?  We're up to 40-something now, right?  Yeah.  I thought I'd UFC 100, though.  But that seems like yesterday.  And you guys came in with that story.  What was the fight?  Was that the Frank Mears fight? 
[01:38:00]  Frank Mears and Brock Lesnar.  Yeah, that was a good time.  And me and Jim met you backstage.  And I told him back then, and you can fucking back me up.  I said, this kid's going to be a champ.  He's going to be the champ soon.  And bing.  You said that about Frank Mears right before the fight, too.  Well, you know, you can't always be right.  In my eyes, he was the champ.  Jimmy, why don't you tell the Frank Mears story again?  I don't know if we told John Jones.  It was after the loss, and we're standing backstage with Reed Harris. 
[01:38:30]  And Brock walks by, and he just looks awesome after a win like that.  And then Frank was beaten up.  You're missing them badly.  Big part of the story, though.  I'm sorry.  Brock walks by, and me and Jimmy both bow our heads because a real alpha male is walking by.  Instinctually, don't make eye contact and bow our heads like two little Omega girl dogs.  Omega girl dogs.  That's awesome.  And then Frank comes by very beaten up.  Did you guys look him in the eyes, or did you kind of still? 
[01:39:00]  No, we still look down, but a little less because he just, you know, I could probably, at that point, go, boo.  Looked at his waistline.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  And Bob goes, Bob looks at him and goes, great job, Frank.  Frank's face was pretty much rearranged.  That's what he says to a guy.  You're one of those type, huh?  No, I didn't know.  He didn't mean it insincerely.  I'm such a big fan of Frank Mir.  I really wanted him to win.  Frank Mir's a badass, man.  And he's the fastest, you know, heavyweight jiu-jitsu guy out there. 
[01:39:30]  I agree.  He fights like a light heavyweight, and he just got his fucking face smashed in, and it looked like Hamburg, and I got nervous.  Yeah, I think he had a hematoma, too, right?  Yeah, it was bad.  It was scary, and I just got nervous, and I was just like, good job, Frank.  Like the little kid in the cult commercial.  Yeah, I was just waiting for him to throw his bloody t-shirt back at me.  Yeah, I got nervous.  Norton just looked at me, and Reed, just both looked at me like, you idiot. 
[01:40:00]  I couldn't believe that he said that.  It's one of my favorite moments of watching a friend just trip and humiliate himself.  Did you just kind of take a sidestep away from him?  Yeah.  Yeah, I looked at Frank like, I don't know what this asshole's talking about.  It wasn't a good job.  It was a terrible job, actually.  We're all in with Jon Jones, though, man.  The first time we saw you fight, we were like, fuck, this is the guy we want to follow.  16-0, as far as I'm concerned.  I mean, 15-1, I understand.  What was the one?  Oh, yeah.  What was the one?  I got the vibe.  Where's your swagger, bro?  We did the slap five, but then I went to do the high five, but he did the fist. 
[01:40:30]  I thought I was on Shay's show for a minute.  I tried to grab his fist and hold it.  15-1 officially, but...  Yeah, that elbow, I didn't think, was out of line.  Accurately squeezing my fist.  Well, the elbow you gave, that was, I mean, that was right when the rules kind of changed  over, right?  I mean, it was...  No, not really.  No, not really.  That Mohawk thing where they were like, this is where you can't hit anymore? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, I don't think it was right when the rules changed over.  It was just like, you know, I jumped into the UFC and MMA so fast.  And, you know, my coaches had explained the rules to me, but it wasn't something we went  over, you know, every day for the first few months of training.  You know, it was like, you know, you can't do this, you can't do that, you can't do that.  But this is all the crazy stuff you can do to them, you know?  So you just kind of forget, you know, so new in the game.  And that was really all that happened.  I just forgot.  Because if they had pride rules in UFC, you'd probably be fucking the heavyweight champ. 
[01:41:30]  And that's the thing, when I first joined the sport, I was watching pride videos all  the time, you know?  Good friends of mine would always give me all these pride videos to study.  So I was watching guys get soccer kicked and, you know, elbowed and kneed in the face  and the ground.  In pride, you can literally just kick the guy in the head while he's on the ground.  Sounds all vicious coming out there.  That's what I love about the new video game.  You know, they have the pride rules.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you can do all this brutal stuff.  Bash him in the face.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's quite the rest.  What else about the new game?  Because we really should talk about it a little bit today. 
[01:42:00]  UFC 3 comes out today undisputed.  Just a sweet game.  You know, it has over 150 UFC fighters in the game, which is a lot more than the old.  You have pride rules.  You can have, you know, guys who fought in pride, fighting guys who fought in the UFC.  You know, these are matchups you would have never gotten to see.  And now you get to see these throughout the video game.  And it's just a sweet game, you know, playing it online.  I'm predicting that it's going to spread like a wildfire.  The first two have.  And so you play online and you play like these shit-talking kids. 
[01:42:30]  Who was that guy?  Chris Cowell was a Navy SEAL, right?  Talking about how the kids in the shooting games just talk on a horrible shit.  That's awful.  Do they really know what you're doing?  They have no idea they're playing.  They don't know what they're playing.  You know, and I don't tell them either.  A little bit.  You have so much pride.  How awesome that would be to be playing him.  Yeah, it's me.  You get ten minutes and, is it really you, man?  Is it really you, man?  Yeah, I kicked your ass.  Prove it.  I kicked your ass. 
[01:43:00]  Anything worse than someone saying prove it?  Well, I've never had that.  To prove that it's you online?  I say I'm Bob Kelly.  They go, yeah, so?  Yeah.  Who?  Yeah, good.  Bobby, what do you think John Jones, Rashad Evans?  What's your thoughts?  Well, I mean, it's going to be, I think it's going to be your toughest fight.  I think it's going to be a tough fight.  Who's next?  No, listen.  No, because, I mean, first of all, you guys know each other.  That's a weird thing that you guys fought with each other.  And Greg Jackson camp is actually cornering you now.  They're like, fuck it.  They were like, we're not cornering anybody. 
[01:43:30]  He wasn't going to corner either one of you.  And now he's actually cornering you, right?  Oh, you know more than I know, because Greg has given me that talk.  I read all the sites.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's funny.  M-M-A-T-K-O.  Man, you know, I'm going to call you.  You just got me really excited.  I'm going to call my coach when I leave.  I'm like, coach, are you coaching me now?  No, but, yeah, look, I think it's going to be a great fight.  I was telling the guys before you got in here, you know, us training together, I think it's  going to be the biggest advantage for me.  Yeah.  Because, you know, I know the ways that he could win the fight.  And I know the ways that I could win the fight. 
[01:44:00]  And I'm really going to, you know, and I've changed so much.  So he just doesn't know.  Where he's older, you know, he's stuck in so many ways.  He has his own tendencies.  And I don't really have too many tendencies.  So I think I know who he is as a person and as a fighter.  And that's going to help me master him.  When you fight, though, I mean, when you look at when you're fighting, the other guy  always looks smaller than you.  I mean, it looks like the first UFC where, like, you'd have a fucking heavyweight fighting  a light, you know, a featherweight.  Yeah.  It's like, especially Sherrod is going to look a lot smaller than you. 
[01:44:30]  Sherrod, I love it.  I mean, Rashad.  He is.  Sherrod.  There's a comic that me and Jimmy know, and his name's Sherrod.  But his name's Sherrod Small.  Well, Evans doesn't tie into it.  No.  I just...  You're panicking, Bobby.  You're panicking.  I am panicking.  It's Jon Jones looking at me and listening.  And now, meanwhile, you're talking to me.  I just...  It really is hard to hold the floor, isn't it?  It really is.  I'm going to hide.  I'm going to hide.  I wasn't really listening.  Do you play...  Do you ever watch The Simpsons?  When Homer's just here, he's like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:45:00]  That's where you're just hearing.  I don't blame you.  I agree with you.  I'm going to say, this is the only one you can't say shit back.  You just take the hit.  No, he's the first guy that you'd know would absolutely hit you if you said the wrong  thing.  I'd do it.  Wait, wait.  Let's get...  This seems...  You're about Sherrod's height, too.  Am I?  You're about Sherrod's height.  Bobby, you want to take a hit from Jon Jones?  I'm not taking a hit.  Come on.  Are you out of your mind?  Come on.  It's been a while.  He leg kicked Jimmy at 30%.  I won't take any more leg. 
[01:45:30]  I'll take a punch in the arm, but I won't take...  No, I don't take the punch.  I want to.  I don't want a hard one, but I want to feel it.  Because Frank Yeager hurt, man.  He didn't hit very hard.  On purpose, he did a light.  It was fucking hurt, man.  He's not going to listen to you.  I figured if I'm going to beat someone up, it should be the redhead in the room.  Oh, shit.  What do you think, huh?  Me?  There's some tie between you two.  Oh, fuck.  Who's redhead?  Oh, fuck.  You know what?  You're right.  Oh, fuck, man.  The redhead's always the evil guy in the fucking heart.  I've been nothing but polite today, Bobby.  The redhead stepped out.  Which one is he going to be? 
[01:46:00]  I don't trust you, though.  Because I know you're going to give that a little extra effort.  Oh, you know, someone's going to get it harder this time.  Because I think Jimmy told you 15% that he went 30 on your own.  Yeah, no, I wouldn't want to take a real hard one, but I would take a little shot.  Don't say that.  That's what she said, right?  Because now he knows he's got to do better than Frankie.  No, but Frankie hurt me.  I mean, those guys hurt just hitting really light.  I mean, it's painful.  He's not going to hit you light.  No.  He's going to hit you about 25 to 30%.  That's what we're getting at.  No more light. 
[01:46:30]  No.  Yeah, listen, man.  I'd go out of this one.  If I'd get choked out, I would get choked.  I wouldn't let him hit you.  You know, I would try to choke him.  This isn't the Jon Jones that I was expecting either.  That's what we should do.  The Machida choke.  The Machida choke?  By the way, did you know he was out?  That was one of the nastiest knockouts ever because Machida was out.  Oh, yeah.  And when you re-watch the video, you can see the angle.  You can see his arm just go limp.  If you know where it is to look for it, but there's no indication that he's out until 
[01:47:00]  you drop him and he just collapses.  Yeah.  You know, it was like, it's something that, you know, I'm not that familiar with because  in practice, obviously, I choke my teammates all the time and they tap and then you get  up and start all over, but he never tapped.  Right.  And so it's just like, you know, you're holding this guy and you wait in front of the tap  and the next thing you know, you kind of feel that you're now holding him up instead of  just holding his neck, you know?  So I think he had about, there was about four seconds where he went out and I was still  holding it.  But, you know, my job is to do my job and the referee is supposed to, you know, make 
[01:47:30]  it stop.  So as soon as he made it stop, it was over.  Did you feel bad that you gently didn't put him back on the ground?  No, not at all.  You got to let it on.  No way.  You got to make it look good.  You know, he didn't even, you know, I read an interview that he did and he's like,  you know, what was Joan supposed to make love to me?  You know, he understands that it's not my job to place him down nicely.  When you were describing that, I'm listening, thinking, holy shit, you're feeling the life  go out of his body, basically.  You just said it differently.  Yeah.  Like, oh, and I feel like, yeah, the life is.  But as Rogan said, he goes, you're killing somebody for a second. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  That's what you do.  That's what your job is, to kill somebody for a second.  But, you know, obviously, we have a good commission and good doctors and he was back on his  feet within, you know, a minute, 30 seconds after the whole situation.  Can't he not get into a ring for 30 days after being knocked out?  I think that's an actual knockout.  But, I mean, his lights were out.  But I don't know.  I don't know.  I got a question about the choke, because we've heard over the years, there's a way to  do a choke and then if you do it wrong, you could really fuck up somebody?  No, not really. 
[01:48:30]  Not really?  You could fuck up their windpipe.  You could mess someone's brain cells.  But you can't do actual damage to the neck?  No, I mean, you obviously could, you know, possibly crush a trachea or something, but  it's just so unlikely.  And is it guaranteed he's going to wake up?  Would it crush a trachea?  I doubt it.  No, no, I mean just a chokehold in general.  I'm sorry.  A chokehold in general.  It's just guaranteed they're going to...  Oh, yeah.  They always wake up.  The commission, they're on it.  You know, like I said, I've said it before in past interviews, you know, commissions and 
[01:49:00]  referees, they're aware that our wives are sitting right in the front row, you know,  so, and it's a national TV, and right now we're trying to get it legalized in New York  State, you know, so they're overprotective.  Yeah, they're overprotective.  So, Bobby, take a choke out.  No, I wouldn't get choked out.  I would never go out.  I'm not going to let them choke me out because that would just, I don't like coming to after  that, like drooling and you guys laughing.  I used to do that.  Your pants are down.  Hanging in a closet with my grandmother taking photos. 
[01:49:30]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Playing the UFC video game, of course.  Ah, very good.  Thank you, man.  Right around.  I like the plug for UFC 3.  Undisputed.  That does not happen in the game.  No.  You don't want to.  Have you ever been knocked out or choked out?  No.  Even in practice?  Never.  I got dropped once.  You know, I kind of saw a flash of light, but I wasn't knocked out at all.  I hit my butt and was like, wow, how did I end up here, you know? 
[01:50:00]  Who did that?  I'm not telling.  I am not saying.  Was it in a fight?  No way.  No, it wasn't.  It was practice.  Is his name right with Sherrod?  No way.  Really?  No way.  I've taken some of that guy's best punches.  So how come that guy always said, I'm sorry, he says, though, he goes, I've handled him  in practice.  There was this one practice we worked out.  I had just gotten to camp and he had been there for, you know, he was close to his fight  and I had just gotten there.  And he helped me down in one practice. 
[01:50:30]  The drill was, you know, like the guy on the bottom starts in like a really crappy position.  The guy on the top, his only job is to hold the guy on the bottom down.  And the drill is supposed to train the guy on the bottom to, you know, fight through it,  get back to your feet and get ready to, you know, fight again.  And that day I was like, it was early.  I wasn't in shape.  He was in great shape.  And he was on top of me and I couldn't get out.  And I was just like, all right, man, I can't get out.  Just let me up.  And he's like, oh, if you quit now, you'll be a quitter forever or something like that. 
[01:51:00]  So I get up, you know.  And so now that's his claim to fame.  And it's the story that he's, you know, going to use for this whole Ampton fight up.  I helped John Jones down.  But holding me down doesn't injure me.  It does absolutely nothing to me.  But that's it.  That's the story.  It's not like he was ground and pounding me or choking me or twisting my arm.  He was just trying to hold me to the floor.  So that's the only day of my whole career that, you know, and it's practice.  It's not like, you know, you're not thinking this is going to be held against me one day.  It's like, we're training. 
[01:51:30]  I'm like, dude, you know, like, dude, we're training.  Oh, God, you want to fight him tomorrow.  It's like you bench pressing.  You're like, dude, give me a little spot, man.  This is heavy.  He's like, no, you quit now.  It's just like, are you serious?  I'm going to make him pay, bro.  So you would love to fight him tomorrow.  You want to get this done.  Yeah, I could totally fight him tomorrow.  And you've got to wait until what?  Is it April?  April 21st, Atlanta, Georgia.  Can't wait.  Oh, two more ones.  It's going to be a big one.  We should go.  That's going to be a big one.  Are you officially training for this?  Monday.  Monday I'll be back in New Mexico and start my full diet, start my new training camp. 
[01:52:00]  But I'm always training.  You know, fighting is like a lifestyle.  So I'm always watching.  So what do you do, just light training in between?  At first, I'll start mainly on my nutrition and, you know, healthy sleep pattern, nutrition,  and I like weightlifting and things like that.  So what do you do in between fights when you've got a little downtime where you let it go a little bit?  Hang around and talk to you guys.  You know, a lot of PR stuff.  But I don't think you eat that shitty.  You probably just...  What do you mean?  Oh, no, I don't eat that bad.  No way.  No, I got family and stuff. 
[01:52:30]  So, you know, I'm home and, you know, I eat, you know, three times a day, four times a day.  Get a healthy lifestyle.  I got shin splints walking over here fast from 47th Street.  I was just hustling.  I'm like, my shins.  Can I ask you...  Did you hear Rocky music playing in your head?  I don't think we've had any of you guys in since Brock Lesnar.  Was he ready to go and retire, you think?  You know, not to...  I love what Brock did for our sport, right?  He came in and, you know, he was awesome marketing-wise. 
[01:53:00]  You know, we had a lot of WWF fans now, you know, watching the UFC.  So I have nothing but respect for him.  But I never really looked at Brock as a warrior.  You know, there's fighters and there's warriors.  And I just never really looked at him as a real warrior, you know.  So, you know, to lose that fight like that, you got kicked in the stomach and you just, you know, turn over and shell up.  It's just not respectable.  Did he get kicked where the...  He looked to me like Overeem aimed right where the surgery might have happened.  And like...  Oh, you know, I didn't even think of that. 
[01:53:30]  He got kicked because he had that colon surgery.  I'm like, I got fucking Overeem.  It was brutal right there.  Yeah, well, that's where the liver's at.  So usually a lot of fighters aim for the liver.  Wow.  It's one of the worst ways to be knocked out.  Don't worry about your liver.  It wouldn't be a fact.  Exactly.  His leg would break if you hit your liver.  He's an alcoholic.  Screw his liver.  Yeah, it's okay.  Wait, so you can knock someone out by just punching him in the liver?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it just knocks the wind out of you.  Or a dog.  You instantly, you know, feel like you're going in shock or something. 
[01:54:00]  But you can recover from it.  Yeah.  He made a whole career out of the liver shots.  Made a whole career out of the liver shot.  Left hook to the liver or knee to the liver.  It's a painful way to be knocked out.  It paralyzes you.  I mean, your legs just go numb, right?  Yeah, it paralyzes you.  You know, you just kind of, you can't have clear thoughts.  You know, you just feel like you're drowning.  But, you know, the way he turtled up, you know, it's a move where you can recover from it.  You know, a lot of guys get knocked out because they get hit to the liver, which they're temporarily paralyzed.  And then the guy attacks him with a secondary attack. 
[01:54:30]  And that's what actually finishes the fight.  But when Brock got hit, you know, he just kind of turtled up.  And, you know, I don't know.  It just wasn't very horrible.  Knocked down by a body shot.  Overeem hits hard, though.  I don't think Brock, he's been hit by some hard guys.  I mean, Shane Carlin fucking hit like a truck.  Oh, yeah.  And he couldn't finish Brock.  But Overeem was a frightening guy.  He had some nasty intentions.  Overeem made fucking movie bad guy faces after he watched it.  That cocky look at the camera.  I'm like, that's what you do in a fucking movie. 
[01:55:00]  Well, that's his Dutch overacting.  It's the demolition, man.  I like all that, though.  I don't like the politeness after fights.  I love Overeem.  I'll have to switch it up for you.  No, that's why we like you, man.  Because in honesty with you, before the fights, after the fights, I hate it.  It's all like sportsmanship all the time.  I understand that's part of the sport already.  I don't need to see it.  Yeah, I hear you.  You know what I mean?  I like it, though.  It depends on who the guys are.  Like, you and Rashad genuinely have issues.  Yeah, it's a real beef. 
[01:55:30]  It's so weird, though.  You guys were friends.  I mean, how does that happen?  How did the friendship end?  Well, you know, we definitely were good buddies at one point.  But basically, you know, I got a title shot.  And I'm not sure if he actually thought that I would win the title shot.  But he was all excited for me.  He's like, you know, man, he came to my dinner.  He's like, hey, man, you know, there's no one I would rather see take my place.  He had gotten injured, so I got his title shot.  You know, then you, man, and, you know, I know you're going to do well.  And I'm pulling for you.  And this is great.  You know, life's all about timing.  You know, and it's just your time. 
[01:56:00]  So, you know, hats off for you and everything.  So, I'm like, oh, that's great.  You know, I got his blessing to go out there and take the championship.  And I went out there and I took the championship.  And then right after I took the championship, he came up with this whole conspiracy that somehow I betrayed him.  And I betrayed his trust by taking a title shot.  And it's like, dude, I'm a young man with a dream to be a world champion.  And now I just got the opportunity.  And I had you bless me with the opportunity.  And now I'm this big traitor.  So, you know, our team, our team all stands by me.  They, you know, the whole team knows him longer than they've known me. 
[01:56:30]  And I've lost no friends throughout the whole situation because they realize that I'm doing what I was meant to do.  I'm doing, you know, I'm being a fighter.  And they are respected.  And he's the only one who's really running around with a sore butt about the whole situation.  How do you not take that shot?  You got to kind of take the shot at the title.  It's like if someone offers you a title, you can't go no.  You'd step on my wife's face if that was the opportunity.  Bob A's.  I wouldn't step on your face.  My wife's face.  I don't think Jimmy would do that.  I like your wife a lot.  It would probably still feel better than you rolling over on her.  You're heavy. 
[01:57:00]  Mean Jimmy.  He's back.  Mean Jimmy.  Mean Jimmy.  Mean Jimmy.  But you set yourself up.  He wasn't even thinking about your wife.  You set yourself up.  I set myself up by walking in.  She has sex with you, bro?  No, not really.  Not really.  It's me and her with two iPads.  That's what it is.  Her looking at pocketbooks in a sexual way. 
[01:57:30]  So do you think you'll be actually after the fight?  Changing the subject.  Yeah, absolutely.  We'll get back to it.  Don't worry.  Trust me.  My fat swings are back.  Yeah, nice talking to you.  Do you think you'll be friends with them after?  Do you think you're going to make up with them after?  Yeah, I can see us developing a level of respect for each other.  That's it, though?  You won't be friends again?  No, no need to be friends.  You know, there's a big world with lots of beautiful people in it.  There's something weird that happens, though, when you beat somebody up or you win.  And there's something psychological that's like, you know, look, dude, fuck it. 
[01:58:00]  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you develop a respect for them.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You're like, man, what a good butt whooping.  You know, it's just every time, you know, no matter.  Like, you guys just saw Carlos Condit fight against Diaz.  And instantly after the fight was over, they're hugging each other and laughing and talking.  Me and Rampage, you know, we're kissing each other and hugging each other as soon as we're done.  It's because Diaz was high.  Hey, man, it's cool, dude.  I love you, man.  What did you think of the fight?  Because Bobby got really mad because he thought that Condit kind of danced around Diaz. 
[01:58:30]  But I like the fact that was just like, you know, he wasn't going to get beat up against the ring.  And he just kept kicking him and he won.  Yeah, it was methodical.  It was kind of how I beat Rampage, you know.  It's a, you know, you got a boxer versus a guy who's kickboxing.  And, you know, Carlos Condit has the kickboxing.  He has the better footwork.  And he utilized a great game plan.  You know, if you talk to the guys the next day, you'll realize that Diaz is probably really sore.  And Carlos probably wasn't.  So, you know, he won the fight.  It's not always that impressive.  But, you know, he took very little damage and he opposed his will. 
[01:59:00]  And, you know, he had no scars on his face after the fight.  So, you know, hats off to him.  I think, I mean, look, I like Condit and I get that his game plan was good.  And I just, it's like when you go into a fight, I know that you're going to choke somebody out.  You're going to knock somebody out.  It's going to be, or it's going to be a fucking great fight.  You know, even when you fought Rampage, you did your methodical game plan.  But you also went in for the fucking kill and took Rampage.  That's, you know, that's what we're expecting you to do.  So, you expected Condit and Diaz just to kind of go at it. 
[01:59:30]  And then it's like you see this, him dancing around, just, you know, getting points.  And you're like, come on, man.  I think to an extent he had to, though.  Because if he would have stayed in the pocket with such a great boxer, I think, you know, Diaz is probably the best boxer in the Wattori division.  So, if he would have stayed in the pocket with that guy and tried to, you know, please impress everybody who's watching, it wouldn't have been best for him.  You know, he would have took a lot of damage.  He could have possibly lost the fight.  And he would have put himself out of his rhythm, you know.  Carlos having the longer limbs, you know, he needs to create that distance to use his reach. 
[02:00:00]  And so, he had to move a little bit more.  But I thought it was a great fight.  People are asking for a rematch, so.  Well, they're asking for a rematch because it wasn't what it was billed out to be, you know.  Because you get hyped up watching the countdown.  And you're like, someone's going home in a coffin.  And then you see some dude running around.  You're like, no, someone's fucking running a marathon.  And you're like, come on.  You know what?  You should get in there and show them.  That's what I tell him.  That's what I tell him.  Listen, this is my little kid.  Shit talker.  What if I just took, I had all this stuff. 
[02:00:30]  Let's do this, Jones.  He just stepped on his foot and ended his MMA career.  Mean Jimmy.  Mean Jimmy.  He's in the studio today.  Could you add funny, though?  Mean funny Jimmy?  That's hilarious.  Mean Jimmy's funny.  I think Jimmy's jealous of you.  I am jealous of Bobby.  He's the fatter, funnier guy.  Oh.  I don't know.  What are you, Steve Martin?  I'll give you a half of that. 
[02:01:00]  Mean Jimmy.  Again, huh?  The big half.  What kind of, what kind of, what kind of, what kind of, what kind of, because people  are asking, what kind of reach height advantage are you going to have against Rashad?  What are the numbers?  You know what?  I'm actually not sure.  I'm not sure.  But it's going to be, it's going to be huge.  He's going to have to jump to punch you in the fist.  I think Rashad's 5'8".  I'm 6'4".  He's 5'8".  I think he's 5'8".  He's a little fella.  I'm 5'8".  So, stand up.  Stand up.  Oh, my God. 
[02:01:30]  I just got scared.  I'm about to hit him right now.  You should.  Right in his chest.  Right in his cocky chest.  Do you work on that look?  Nobody has a cocky chest.  Did you?  You see that look he gave you?  And he doesn't work on it.  Did you see how quickly I looked away?  Yes, of course.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you got a lot.  You got height and you got your reaches.  I don't know.  I think he was looking at my belt line.  You guys are supposed to look away completely.  Yeah, right?  That's going to be a weird looking fight.  Well, he looks bigger than anybody. 
[02:02:00]  But 5'8"-6'4".  Oh, yeah.  Look at the reach difference here, too.  Assuming that, you know.  Yeah.  Assuming that he adds up.  Pop, pop, pop.  Stay away, baby.  Holy shit.  You're going to get to his shoulder.  Ah, yeah.  That's not going to be fun for him.  Sean Jones has his fist on your chin.  Let's get back to Earth, though.  I mean.  It's Bobby.  It's Bobby.  I mean.  It's just not right.  Tonight, to even compare.  I don't remember.  Shout out.  Bobby.  The last fight I got into was in a bathroom.  Bobby, what would your move be? 
[02:02:30]  It's disrespectful to the air.  What would your move be if there was a real thing going on with you?  If John's was really.  If John's was.  What would your move, John's?  Because we all would like at least try to survive.  Please tell me.  What would you do?  I'd be like, well, do you take 50s?  That's not funny.  What would you do, though, really?  If he was going to fight me, I would just bow my head like the fucking, the young lions  do on the fucking National Geographic channel.  Oh, is that it?  I'd fucking bow my head and roll over my belly and fucking show him my balls. 
[02:03:00]  I'd sniff my asshole and I'd fucking let him walk away.  Animal Kingdom shit.  You got to take the masculine angle.  You got to go like, dude, I don't want to do this.  I don't want to get arrested.  I don't want to go to jail.  Is that it?  Yeah.  He'd be like, you're not.  You go into a hospital.  That was actually really funny.  I wouldn't.  If I had to fight. 
[02:03:30]  The only way I would fight a guy like John Jones is if I had to.  That's what I'm saying.  If you had to, what would your.  My first thing I would do.  What would your full picture do?  I could see him laying on his back, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Exposing his soft white underbelly.  With my.  I'd have those dots.  With little nipples.  When you see animals do that.  My teats.  When you see animals do that, you always feel sad for the one that had to give in.  You're like, oh, really?  You didn't even try to fight?  That's how you get.  They just know. 
[02:04:00]  They just know, right?  There's no ego.  There's no ego.  That's what it is.  There's no ego.  And trust me, if Bones Jones wanted to fight me, my ego, there'd be nothing.  It'd be out the window.  It's Johnny Bones on Twitter.  Johnny Bones.  His little nipples will be lactating for some reason.  They're not little.  Yeah, they'll be like little razor blades all hard and torched from being beaten.  Too far.  Too far.  A little strange.  I've got a little bullshit on you.  That's on him.  He just, he went too far.  We're just having fun.  We got real for a second. 
[02:04:30]  A little too graphic there, wasn't it?  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little fun.  Oh, yeah.  The lactating was pretty bad.  I just filled up a little bit.  You took it to a whole different level.  Yeah, I did.  I made it very real.  You realize everyone stopped laughing and just trying to look good at you.  That does come from a real place, you know?  Oh, Mars is in the studio.  Mars had a question for Johnny Bones on Twitter.  What's up, Mars?  Do you have a shirt that fits?  He's a big UFC fan as well.  Yeah.  I know.  He was telling us he wanted to ask you something.  What's up, Mars? 
[02:05:00]  Mars knows a lot about the sport.  He's a little nervous.  Mars was also making faces when he was talking about Rashad.  What do you mean?  Mars was saying, Rashad is not 5'8".  No?  He's not 5'8".  How tall is he?  He's about 5'11".  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Uh-oh.  Oh, you're a Rashad Evans fan, aren't you?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's what he's getting out of this.  No, I'm not.  Watch him out, Mars.  Yeah, don't be correcting me, man.  No.  Oh, shit.  By the way, Mars trains, so he's got a couple of Mars. 
[02:05:30]  You coming in here correcting me.  He does train, too.  He trains.  Standing behind me.  I feel uncomfortable.  Dude, I'm sorry.  What are you trying to do?  I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to get my money.  My $5 for the magazine.  Oh, yeah.  He did hook me up with the new Fight magazine.  Oh, man.  Heard I made the cover, and I hadn't seen it, so thank you.  And you really want five bucks?  No, man.  Trying to kill some airtime.  He wasn't getting it.  I'm thinking, yeah, exactly.  I'm thinking of what you're going to ask, Mr. Johnson.  Yeah, why are you in a character right now?  Yeah, exactly.  You're like an 80s Mexican comic right now.  No, man.  Come on, AC. 
[02:06:00]  What the fuck is wrong with you, Marcus?  That's the version of him rolling on his back.  Holy shit.  He's showing his belly right now.  All right.  After you, go ahead and get the light heavyweight championship, because we know you are.  He has it.  He already has it.  Just stupid.  Who's next, man?  I thought you were a big fan.  I'm sorry.  What are you going to ask him after he beats Jones for the belt?  All right, go ahead.  After you continue defending it.  What are you going to ask him?  When he's fighting Rampage?  No.  Someone else already did that.  Well, I made the mistake, but I knew it wasn't the Rampage. 
[02:06:30]  But I knew it wasn't.  Shut up.  Hold on.  Let me correct myself.  I know you respect Anderson Silva highly, but we all know that is the fight of the future.  What do you think about taking Anderson Silva?  Anderson, ah.  The fight of the future.  The fight of the future.  I want to fight all fights of the future?  Yeah.  I want to practice a front face kick.  Oh, they're killing him.  That's like a Twitter question.  I'm going to answer it just because I feel so bad.  We all know it's the fight of the future.  Well, good observation, sir. 
[02:07:00]  Yes.  He's good.  The fight of the future.  Technically, any fight that hasn't happened is the grand fight of the future.  Grand?  Now it's grand.  Grand fight of the future.  Nice.  Is it in a ballroom?  Really?  That's going to be the, I mean, that's the best fight there is out there.  I mean, think about it.  Any other fight that you thought about Brock Lesnar and...  He rambling.  He kind of sounds like Rocky.  Yeah.  There's no one compared to that.  What about Rashad?  I'll answer this question if you say, Adrian, Adrian. 
[02:07:30]  What's the weight difference between you and Silva?  20 pounds, right?  Is it 185 and 205?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, it's not.  I mean, he walks around.  It's more than that.  Why don't you tell him, Mars?  Why don't you correct him?  Correct him.  I was standing back here minding my own business.  Hey, I was standing back here minding my own business.  I was standing back here.  Nice shirt, Holmes.  Hey.  Two one.  Two one.  Let's do this.  Let's do this, Mars.  You got a question.  I asked a question. 
[02:08:00]  He asked a question.  It wasn't a good question.  It was not?  No.  It was a statement with a question and a fucking horrible fight of the future reference.  I don't even know where the question part was.  With a bad t-shirt.  Yeah.  A bad t-shirt.  It really is awful.  No, I'm joking.  It's a traditional.  Okay.  It's a dragon.  Exactly.  It's a dragon with a fucking hand grenade.  Go fuck yourself.  He doesn't like your midget torso.  I'm sorry, Mars.  I didn't mean that again.  Why are you guys so mean?  Because he used to have a toxic environment.  They have no sex life.  That's what it is.  Oh.  No.  We'll talk about him.  He used to be in shape and he's not in shape. 
[02:08:30]  What are you talking about?  And it bothers us.  Because he used to be the one guy that kept himself together.  Now you've got to show his arms up like he's holding suitcases.  Like he's holding suitcases.  Is that it?  That's hilarious.  Would you ever fight?  Would you ever fight, Silva?  Anderson?  You know what?  I think it's a fight that's kind of inevitable.  You know, it's what the fans want to see.  It will be a big money fight for the UFC and me and Anderson.  But, you know, my job is just to fight whoever's next, whoever's in front of me. 
[02:09:00]  So there's a lot of work left in the light heavyweight division.  You know, there's Rashad Evans and there's Dan Henderson.  You know, Shogun and Lyoto.  I'm sure they're going to want to come back around and get their rematches.  Hendo really wants to fight you.  Oh, yeah.  That's what he's saying.  You know.  I mean, if that's how he feels, then come get it.  You know, I can't imagine losing to a guy who's 40 in a combatant sport.  It's not like we're playing chess or golf, you know.  Wow.  That's crazy.  But Anderson.  He just said that about Dan Henderson. 
[02:09:30]  Well.  I couldn't say that about Jimmy.  So you don't think Dan's a problem?  That right hand?  No.  I mean, the biggest thing about fighting, you know, you got to know what you're getting into.  So with Dan Henderson, you're getting into a fight with a guy who's a wrestler.  You know, he's a wrestler first.  And he has a huge overhand right and, you know, a left hook.  So it's just like, you know, I take this sport so seriously.  And there's thousands of kickboxing combinations. 
[02:10:00]  And there's thousands of takedowns.  And there's just so many techniques out there.  And to lose to someone who's, you know.  You're saying he's predictable?  He's predictable, yo.  You know, he has great wrestling, which is fading.  You know, he got taken down by Shogun a lot.  Shogun has some of the worst wrestling in the light heavyweight division.  So his wrestling is fading.  And he has this big bomb that you have to watch out for.  You know, you spend three months focusing on counters and slips to an overhand right.  Or a left hook or his, you know, his right uppercut. 
[02:10:30]  And then you go out there and win the fight.  So it's just, you know, I've fought in guys who are way bigger of a puzzle and way younger.  Was Machida harder for you?  Because he's so odd.  Yeah, Machida's quick, man.  He can throw a left leg up, a right leg up.  Oh, that's right.  You know, he can switch stances.  You know, he's a black belt in jiu-jitsu.  He has a nice clinch.  He's got karate.  Yeah, he has.  You know, exactly.  So I've lost sleep fighting some fighters.  And Dan Henderson, with all due respect, you know, you just kind of know when you know. 
[02:11:00]  And I couldn't imagine losing to him.  Is there anybody that you're actually like, oh, shit, this guy would be a problem if I want to win and if I have to fight this guy?  What are you going to say?  Well, you know, to be honest, this Rashad Evans fight could be an interesting fight.  You know, he is a tough guy.  You know, he's only lost one time.  And you can't look past that.  And he won on the Ultimate Fighter as a heavyweight.  As a heavyweight.  And those fights don't even add it onto his record.  So he's a winner.  You know, some people are just winners.  You know, like Tebow.  You know, some people just figure out ways to win. 
[02:11:30]  Rashad's one of them.  And I'm one of them.  Except the Patriots.  So we're going to figure out who wants it more.  I think my ambition will take care of itself.  Hey, speaking of football, you got brothers in the NFL here?  Yeah, yeah.  I just learned that looking at Twitter just a second.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, my older brother is a Baltimore Raven.  And my little brother's down at AP Sports in Miami, Florida, getting ready for this next combine.  Where's your brother playing the Ravens?  He's a defensive end.  You got number 97.  He's a beast.  What a family.  Holy shit.  What a family. 
[02:12:00]  You got three pros.  You got great genes in your family.  Three pros.  HGH, man.  That's all it is.  HGH.  Joking.  Is there only three of you?  Yeah, there's three of us.  And all three are in professional sports.  Wow.  So now my mom's like, oh, I need a new living room set.  And I'm like, uh-uh.  Hang on, girl.  Hang on.  There's nothing wrong with this set right here.  You know, like she's trying to, you know, soak it all in now and get new everything.  It's not happening.  No, not good for her.  Good for her.  Girl, you might go out there and get a job. 
[02:12:30]  She'll work.  Are you here in upstate New York?  You live up?  You still live in upstate New York?  Yeah, I live in Ithaca.  Ithaca, New York.  Really?  You picked Ithaca?  Yeah.  You're from Rochester.  Did you do time in Binghamton, too?  I have never done time.  Not time like that.  That was G.O.V.  I actually did juvie time in Rochester.  Did you really?  In Rochester.  In Rochester, New York?  The worst juvie place I've ever been in.  Why do they ship you to Rochester?  I got arrested in Spensaport.  Spensaport, New York.  I got arrested.  Going to juvie.  Now you can't get arrested anywhere. 
[02:13:00]  Mean Tony.  Yeah.  Why?  Tony.  That's mean.  Jon Jones is from Rochester, so this should be good.  Why Rochester the worst one?  I don't know.  It's because those fucking...  I don't know, dude.  It's bad.  And you'd think that it wouldn't be...  The cops are awful.  Terrible.  Because there's nothing going on, so when something happens, they want to shoot somebody.  I stole a gumball machine.  The guy had a shotgun to my head and caught it.  And he goes, if he moves, shoot him.  I was like, dude, it's gum. 
[02:13:30]  Like, it was gum.  Dude, I'm 14, bro.  Yeah, they don't fuck around up there.  Yeah, they party in the woods and shit.  Like, yeah, you spend all day cutting trees down, and I was scared, man.  Fucking scared in Rochester.  They made you work?  No.  Well, in that one, you have to count out like a number.  And that's when I started praying to God in that one.  I was like, please.  Oh, you never told this story.  Oh, yeah, dude.  The Rochester Juvie was the last time I drank.  That's the last time I had a drink was in that one, because that one scared the fuck out of me.  Whose mule was it out of?  It was this guy. 
[02:14:00]  He was a counselor with one arm.  He had a baby arm, and he used to come in at night and just rub it on my head.  The dead arm on my forehead and open my lips.  Take my strong hand.  Bobby was a problem.  Bobby was a big problem growing up.  Big.  Yeah, you know, criminals always start with gumball machines.  I was, I was, I was, what are you going to do?  I just wanted gum, Jim.  What were you going to do with the gum when you got it?  I chewed it.  I was fucking shit-faced.  Why did you need all of them?  I just wanted gum. 
[02:14:30]  I was there.  I just took it off and grabbed it and screwed, and I had a pocket full of nickels.  I can't tell if this is serious.  I know, right?  It's the worst criminal story ever.  I had a pocket full of nickels that I hid under a rock.  And they really had a shotgun to your head?  Shotgun to my head.  Holy fuck.  I jumped the fence and I heard, he had a fucking shot.  He goes, if he moves, shoot him.  I was like, are you fucking kidding me?  Wow.  Yeah, they don't fuck around upstate New York, man.  Take it downstairs in the basement of the pawn shop to meet Zed. 
[02:15:00]  Zed's dead, baby.  And that's why I moved to Ithaca.  And it's quiet up there.  Really?  You like quiet?  Quiet, peaceful.  It's nice because, you know, like most of the people that live there are really old.  So it's like really calm and everybody knows what they're into and everybody has their own little lives.  And then there's a college town, too.  You know, there's Cornell University and Ithaca College.  So, you know, I can like live the responsible family man house, you know, and family and kids.  And then if I want to get rowdy, you know, I can go hang with my college friends.  So it's like a perfect medium.  You know, hot wings and beer and throw up in a parking lot? 
[02:15:30]  Bomber subs.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Cold, too, man.  Jeez.  Cold, yeah.  Yep, I love it there.  I love it.  I lived in Western New York for 10 years and no more.  Those winters are brutal.  What part?  Well, Rochester for three and Buffalo for three and I went to college in Geneseo.  Nice.  So I know all about Western New York.  Oh, yeah.  But the winters killed me, man.  Horrible.  Yeah, it's awful.  Up there is like, that's the way you drive by and you go, dude, I'd never live here.  I could never.  Look at that fucking house, dude. 
[02:16:00]  Could you imagine being there?  It's just all quiet.  There's no neighbors.  You're like, fuck me.  Although when I went to Geneseo, I decided to stay up there a couple summers when it  got real quiet and you know what?  You get used to it.  It's kind of cool.  I'd love to live up there now.  Fly fishing up there?  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Don't fly fish.  You want to go?  No.  Come on.  Not with you.  It's not a code for fucking getting naked in the woods.  I just don't get arrested, bro.  You might start stealing stuff.  Yeah, but if I start stealing stuff, you can chase me down and hold me for the cops. 
[02:16:30]  That is true.  Well, what do you do up there, then?  You know, I just got a house.  So right now, I'm just doing a lot of interior design stuff at the house.  Imagine the house.  Interior decorating.  Yeah.  You know what you get for your money in Ithaca, New York?  Oh, God.  Can you imagine?  You're probably the king.  You get some nice stuff.  You get some nice stuff.  You're probably like the guy in Roadhouse who just drives on both sides of the fucking  highways with his Cadillac at the top down.  Bentley.  But, uh... 
[02:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  I see.  You have a Bentley?  Actually, it's pretty badass, too.  Hell yeah.  Yeah, 2012.  You get it fucking customed out, right?  Yeah.  It's sick, man.  All the crown on it is flat black now.  And it's dirty.  It's red and black.  My favorite colors.  Was that the thing you bought for yourself when you finally...  Yeah.  Well, the house.  The house was...  The house and the Bentley?  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, what are you buying for your interior decorating?  What are you buying?  Like, what is your taste?  Oh, all types of stuff, man.  That's the gayest question I've ever heard.  He just said interior decorating.  Yeah, but don't apply to John's fucking talk about it. 
[02:17:30]  Why not?  I know, dude.  Come on.  You fucking queen.  Hold on a second.  So, what do you do for the interior decorating?  What is your taste?  I don't like the fact that John is siding with you when you really wanted to say that to him  but didn't have the guts.  Don't mention interior decorating, but then I bring it up and you act like I'm the homo.  And I was going to start answering it, too.  Have you picked out a duvet yet?  What's the matter?  A couple of men talking about doilies.  Something wrong with that.  I'm curious.  Doilies?  That's grand.  What's the matter?  Don't forget to get the little soaps.  Get the little seashells in your bathroom. 
[02:18:00]  I have some wonderful sconces you should look at Mr. Bones.  Nice hand towels.  So, I'm curious as to what does John Jones like to buy?  What does his house look like?  I guess the biggest...  There's a pretty sweet movie theater in there.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So, I guess that's like my pride of the whole place.  That's so crazy that that's like part of our life.  Now, when you get money, that you actually build your own fucking theater.  That's crazy.  Back in the day, you had to go to a theater.  So, Bobby, you got a movie theater now?  No.  I got a fucking TV that I'm two feet away from. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  The iPad and the toilet.  No remote.  I love a movie theater.  Anthony has one of those fucking houses.  Yeah.  I love it.  Houses?  Well, no.  I have one house, but it's that type of house where I could go in and I've set it up the  way I like it.  Yeah.  That's it.  Movie theater.  Bar downstairs.  You know.  That's all I really need.  I've never written forever now.  And it's like, it's actually been hard for me to spend all the money on the house, making  it so nice. 
[02:19:00]  Because it's like, you know, you just always feel as if you have to give it back one day.  It's like, why am I invested?  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Believe me, there's panic that goes along with it.  Yeah.  So, it's really hard for me to even fathom like, this is all mine now.  And like, you know, I can paint this wall the color I want.  And I can, you know, tear down this wall completely.  Dude, it's been pretty cool.  It's been what I've been doing since I fought last.  You're getting endorsements?  Oh, yeah.  It's definitely.  Yeah, that money will fucking add up fast.  Yeah.  Is that where the fighters make most of the, I mean, I know you're the champion, so you 
[02:19:30]  make your money.  You make a lot of money on the gate and, you know, you're putting asses in seats.  But to a lot of the fighters, is that where they make most of their money in the endorsements  wearing the, you know, the banner on the back and the stuff?  Yeah.  It's safe to say, you know, some of the fighters, you know, some of the champions like St.  Pierre and Anderson and myself, I think we would make most of our money through pay-per-views  and things like that.  But endorsements are huge, too.  You know, not until, you know, this year, you know, I'll probably make more in fights 
[02:20:00]  than in endorsements.  But endorsements has been carrying me for a while now.  You know, like Bud Light and K-Swiss and all these companies have been taking great care  of me and it's great, you know, but as a fighter, there's just so many avenues of making money,  you know, like you can do seminars and you can do autograph signings and, you know, guest  appearances and, you know, club appearances and you can open your own gym and there's just  so many different things, you know, movies and all types of stuff.  So, the fight games, it's expanding. 
[02:20:30]  I had a second part to the endorsement question.  It's not like how the sports sell the money, right?  Not yet?  You know, I can't complain.  I can't complain.  I have two brothers in the NFL and I make more than both of them in endorsements.  So, the money is coming in now.  Yeah, it comes in.  You know, the UFC is the hottest thing right now.  You know, it's the fastest growing and it's hot.  And all the companies are realizing it, you know, the Nikes and the Pepsis and Gatorades.  It's the only sport that goes into other countries, I mean, except for, like, boxing.  I mean, you fight in Dubai, you fight in England. 
[02:21:00]  I mean, they don't, baseball, basketball, NFL don't reach that far.  It's international, yeah.  You don't need money to fight, you know.  You can grow up in Brazil, you can grow up in the slums, you can grow up in Malibu.  You know, it's just a sport that, you know, it doesn't matter what race you are or where  you're from, you can do it anywhere.  And the world's catching on to it really fast.  I love that it's a worldwide sport.  I love that.  Is that why they, you know the banner they have at the beginning of the fight?  You know, he's announcing the fight.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the banner behind you.  Buffer's announcing the fight.  They never show him, because I love when he fucking announces the fighters, because he 
[02:21:30]  just screams in your face.  He's yelling at you.  It's the...  Yeah, and they never, they always just show the banner.  Is that why?  Because they have to show...  No, they don't.  But I think most people would not be a creep about Bruce Buffer and...  Come here.  Does he doesn't pump you up?  Yeah.  You don't get fucking like when he's screaming at you up.  Bob, just finish what you're saying.  It's so hard to come when they go to the banners.  Let me take some.  I mean, you can put it on pause. 
[02:22:00]  I will fucking...  Slow-mo.  The Bruce Buffer 360 is one of my favorite things.  I got his number.  You can call him.  I got his number two.  Oh, okay.  I bet you do.  He told me to say this.  Does he do private shows for you?  That's funny.  Bruce Buffer is fucking great.  Speaking of endorsements...  I don't think it's great.  But jeez, relax.  No, he's great, dude.  He's classy, dude.  No, but he is...  When he announces the main event, it's fucking crazy.  Yeah, it gets me going.  He's...  Because he yells at the fighters.  It's weird.  You don't get to see that. 
[02:22:30]  But if you're at the live event, he's literally yelling,  Yeah!  And he's screaming and yelling at you.  Introducing first.  Fighting.  God of the red corner.  Yeah.  It gets you going.  And the emphasis on fighting, too.  Fighting!  He's great.  He's so much better than his brother.  His brother was the guy for years.  Let's go on rumblings.  Wait, they're brothers?  Yes.  No, no, no.  I thought he was his son.  He was...  They're brothers.  He was his manager for years.  He would book his gigs.  Now, Bruce is the motherfucker.  Yeah, I actually asked him recently. 
[02:23:00]  I said, you know, which company is making more money?  Because they trademarked these sayings.  You know, Michael Breffer.  Remember, let's get ready to rumble.  And then Bruce Breffer was, it's time.  And he said, Michael Breffer with the let's get ready to rumble.  It's just a whole empire.  Boxing has had longevity.  But we're catching up.  I'll tell you this.  You know who works more?  Bruce.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure he's catching up to his brother.  And he's way more exciting.  I mean, let's get ready.  That's one line.  This motherfucker gets in his face. 
[02:23:30]  In the red corner.  John Bones.  That's not bad.  Bobby's losing his mind.  Are you auditioning?  How great would I be?  Fantastic.  We're running out of time.  We've got to get Johnny out of here in a few minutes.  Yes, we have him.  I keep saying Johnny because it's Johnny Bones on Twitter.  John Jones, of course.  Oh, it works.  UFC 3 Undisputed.  Available today on Xbox and PS3. 
[02:24:00]  I think we've got five copies we're going to give away.  Okay.  Oh, nice.  We could do it now.  We'll take five random callers for whatever.  Do we actually have the games or no?  How are you guys going to give them away?  You got good questions or something?  You want to do something with it?  We're going to ask a few questions.  We're going to go lazy.  All right, let's give it away.  Do we have any here or no?  No.  We'll mail them, though.  You should see how long it takes to Jimmy taps.  One second, two second, or three seconds.  We all know who would win that.  It's going to be one second.  One second.  That's it?  Yeah, I don't hold out.  I'm not testing myself. 
[02:24:30]  This is not a test of mono on mono.  I'm just curious as to what it feels like to have a man crushing you.  All right, then.  You said it, not me.  I know my limits.  I know my limits.  I would never take another leg kick again.  Man, that was fucking horrible.  I loved that.  He gave it a little extra.  Everyone else played by your rules, and Jon Jones kind of looked at all of us before  he went in and watched this.  Fedor, when I did the neck, he choked me.  I was actually, I think, his last victory. 
[02:25:00]  I was.  He had a couple losses after me.  I was bad luck for him.  That was terrible.  And I love Fedor.  Do you understand?  We interviewed Fedor, and he doesn't even speak English.  How did that work out?  It was the strangest thing, and we were making, we were hoping the translator was, you know.  Does he have much character?  I mean, he's pretty straight-faced.  No, no, no.  He's very stoic.  Were you guys nervous the whole time?  Yeah, yeah.  No.  Someone brought up his drawings.  He's a painter.  I didn't know that.  But it's like Disney characters, and we're all.  You're lying.  I swear to God, dude.  Not the last emperor.  I'm not buying it. 
[02:25:30]  Somebody brought up that he paints, so we looked it up on the internet, and it was like fucking  cartoon.  I don't know.  It was cartoon characters, and we all.  It's good.  Fucking fancy work.  I love your brush strokes.  You didn't laugh in front of him, did you?  Nobody laughed.  Let me.  No.  We wanted to.  Let me tell you what scared us the most about the Fedor thing was the people he would.  Or with.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You know, they're the real deal.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They walked in with giant Russian Olympic winter jackets.  They would just.  There was at least eight of them.  And it was like, you knew not to even.  Dude, Fedor is scary, bro. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, it was a Russian entourage.  Yeah, he's scary, bro.  They were trying to sell.  You realize I'm not making any statements?  I'm like, oh, really?  I think you.  I thought he was invincible, but I really think that you would beat Fedor.  And I thought he was absolutely invincible.  And he fought.  He was a very tough dude, but he's a little older now.  And I think that you would beat him very much.  I'm that kid that grew up watching him.  Sure.  So he's still Fedor to me.  So I'm just like.  Would you be intimidated if you stepped in the ring with him, even if you wound up beating  him?  I'd be.  Yeah, I'd be a little nervous.  Would the idea of him actually connecting give you a little bit of pause?  Yeah.  I mean, he's just a great fighter, man.  He has a great judo game, you know, great looping punches, you know, great jiu-jitsu. 
[02:26:30]  You've seen him tap out all the time.  He can win a fight anyway.  So where he's getting a little weak.  My same theory with Chuck Liddell.  Where his chin is, you know, not there anymore, and he's not that same fighter.  If he hits you, you know, he still can get that same effect that he's used to getting  when he hits people.  So you got to respect that.  Didn't you see, though, he was starting.  I asked him this, too.  Hopefully the translator gave it to him right.  But it seemed like he was just relying on a big punch after a while and not wrestling guys  or not taking him down.  It's like when he went after Verdum, he just got, you know, I think it was a triangle choke 
[02:27:00]  that he put him on.  It seemed like he was just kind of standing up and waiting for that big hand to connect  and he wasn't doing other stuff.  I didn't know why.  No, I agree.  Yeah, you know, sometimes your creativity just starts to fade when you've been in the  game so long.  You think you just kind of get sick of the routine?  Can that happen, too?  Yeah, the routine of training and the fight game.  You know, a lot of older fighters, they don't get up from fights like the young guys do,  you know.  But guys are constantly evolving, too.  I mean, guys are constantly getting better and better.  That's true, too.  So Verdum was better than last time, you know, I mean, the last time he fought.  I mean, these guys that fought in pride aren't the same guys and they were younger back then. 
[02:27:30]  He was older.  And they're a lot bigger, too.  I mean, he fought guys that are way bigger than him.  Monsters, like literal giants.  Yeah, the Korean fucking giant.  The guy fell on him and you couldn't see him.  Big boy.  Most people, yeah.  Big boy.  I don't understand how you guys deal with like a frustrating loss.  Like in our business, we have a shitty radio show.  We know we got tomorrow to get right back on.  Another shitty show.  We have five in a row.  You know what?  Saturday's coming.  You know what?  There might just be. 
[02:28:00]  But sooner than later, we're going to hit it out of the park again.  You guys, you get a frustrating loss.  You got to sit around for months before you can get back and go, look, that was a shitty  loss and, you know, I'm back now.  Yeah, that's what inspires me is to work my butt off like I do.  Because you don't want that feeling.  Yeah, that feeling and just like being exposed.  You know, you know, if you get knocked out or something, everybody you know will have  that on their DVR forever.  You with your eyes rolled back and your tongue hanging out and whatever.  So that's what motivates me.  I'm like, I cannot let this happen to me. 
[02:28:30]  And then you got months to wait to get back.  Months until you can redeem yourself.  Months.  I don't know how you deal with that.  I got to piss so badly.  So do I, man.  I want to take a shot, but I want John to do the call.  But I'm afraid if I take like a choke or something before I piss, I'll piss my pants off.  And why wouldn't you want to do that?  Go pee.  Robert.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to pee, too.  God, that would be so great.  Oh, man, wouldn't it?  Just give me the call button and I'm going to take a bath.  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff, what's up?  I was just calling to get the UFC 3 for my son. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, but John Jones has decided you got to answer a question.  Bring it on.  All right, Jeff.  Hmm.  Who did I fight at UFC 100?  Red Rum.  Red Rum?  That's what he said.  Next.  Ah.  Oh, wow.  Let's go to Gil.  Yeah.  Hey.  I just wanted to win a game.  Is that the same question?  Yeah, dude.  Ask Siri.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:29:30]  You got time.  Who did I fight at UFC 100?  Just ask Siri.  What do you got?  Is it another black dude, right?  Nope.  Another black dude.  Are you crazy?  You can get one of us killed in here.  You had about a 50-50 shot of getting that right.  It was Frank Mir and what's his name?  Next.  Sorry.  Now, I mean, we got Brandon.  He has to know the answer.  You had to Google it by now. 
[02:30:00]  No, I didn't Google it, but it was Ryan Bader.  What?  Let's go to Matt.  Matt.  Yo.  Hey.  You got the answer?  Jake O'Brien.  Ooh.  Glue go plus.  All right.  You got it, man.  Hold on.  So, Matt gets a game on line four.  Whoever's paying attention back there for us.  Thank you.  Gennaro.  We're on with John Jones.  Johnny Bones on Twitter.  Hey, Johnny.  What's going on?  I actually got a question for you.  What's up, man?  Are you kind of annoyed that, you know, you'll never get the chance to fight Matt Hamill? 
[02:30:30]  Because you were putting in work.  Yeah.  And it kind of sucks that he retired.  Yeah.  I wonder, does that bother you at all?  No.  It's funny.  My buddies were just asking me the same question like two days ago.  I was like, dude, he won and then took off.  But, no, it doesn't bother me at all.  Dude, Matt's a guy who I respect a lot.  And, you know, he's from Utica and I'm from, you know, the Beamton area.  So, we both have mad respect for each other.  I'm actually really happy for him. 
[02:31:00]  You know, he's achieved so much with his life and the little handicap that he has.  And so, I'm just so happy for him.  Did you see the movie?  I haven't, but I want to see it.  I want to see it.  He has a movie.  Hopefully, his victory over me will be the finale.  Like, yeah, the movie goes off.  It's going to have to be because that was pretty much the pinnacle of his career.  Yeah, it was good.  You know, it happens.  All downhill from there.  I'm happy for Hamill, though, dude.  And, you know, he's a good dude at the end of the day.  All right.  So, what kind of question do I got to answer? 
[02:31:30]  I don't know, but you might want to have a friendlier attitude, sir.  It's kind of a shitty attitude when you want a gift.  Stop trashing John's deaf friend.  Hey, what kind of question I got to ask?  I don't know.  That was the pinnacle of his deaf career.  You want to go plug the fucking game in for you?  Jesus Christ.  I don't know the question.  All right, Eric.  I hung up on him.  Yo, wow.  You hung up on him.  Oh, man.  Poor guy.  Sit next.  Sorry.  Hey, what's up?  Eric.  Ah, crabby phone. 
[02:32:00]  No.  Brian.  Crabby phone.  What's up, Brian?  Hey.  Brian.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pay attention, goddammit.  Yeah, ask a question to John Jones if you want to win a video game.  I just want to say I'm going to be at my first event in Atlanta when he fights in April.  Oh, man.  That's awesome, man.  That's really cool.  I'm excited to go down and see him.  No, I appreciate you coming, man.  It should be a good show.  All right, man.  Good luck to you.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  You want a video game?  I'd love one, yeah. 
[02:32:30]  Cool.  That was real steak.  That wasn't a good question.  Hang on.  Wait.  I'm supposed to be asking the question.  No, he's supposed to ask the question.  Oh, John is.  Yeah, he's asking questions.  Somebody get this man some coffee.  I was tingling.  I missed the whole thing.  You're now obese, tingling.  This is like a fucking elderly show.  You've been holding a piss for 40 minutes.  I don't hold pisses for anybody.  All right.  Here's the question.  Who did that fight at UFC 94? 
[02:33:00]  What's happening now?  Next.  Just Google it.  There's a fucking massive computer in your hand.  Exactly.  You should have just pretended.  You should have just kept talking while you Googled.  Wait.  Oh, wait.  94.  That was.  And that's when you're putting Google in.  Stupid.  Just hold his phone up and you hear it in the Siri voice giving the answer.  All right.  At least try.  Tell us we have to wrap with John in a minute.  If we have to do it fast, then I can do the rest of them through Twitter.  Because I actually just got the Xbox game sent to me. 
[02:33:30]  And I have PS3.  So I'm looking to give away the video game for Xbox to somebody.  To some lucky follower on Twitter.  That means you're going to have to mail it yourself.  Yeah.  That's no problem.  All right.  Oh, man.  Are we done with Matt?  Should we get back in here?  Should we give one more away?  Give one to Matt.  Yeah.  Give one to Matt because he's going to see him.  Matt, just hang on.  Give your information.  All right.  Line in.  Even though you blew it horribly.  All right.  You're going to be sweet.  This was a lot of fun.  Yes, it was.  Great times.  Are you taking another move, Jimmy?  Or no?  I would like to if John would.  I mean.  Yes.  I would not request full strength.  And don't break my arm. 
[02:34:00]  I'm shooting a special.  I can't have a broken arm.  How about a double with Bobby?  That's a double move.  What?  I'm sorry.  How about a double?  What kind of joke are you going to do?  Let's see here.  I can give you the machida joke.  Give me the machida joke?  Is that the one you almost killed him with?  I can almost kill him.  All right.  Fair enough.  All right.  So.  What's the other move, too?  Because people have asked me the different ones.  You want a different joke or what? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  What are you doing with that microphone?  You're just waving it in a circle.  Yes, I am.  Casting a spell on us.  Let's see here.  There's all types of jokes.  You've got your true-to-choice on rear naked choke.  Rear naked.  Have I done that?  No.  You've done a rear naked.  Yeah.  I'll take the machida joke.  The true-to-choice?  Yeah.  One true-to-choice coming up.  By the way, I shouldn't have ordered it so casually.  Because I've seen it.  It's a fucking horrifying thing.  I'll take a number of two, please.  I'll tap very quickly on this one.  All right.  Can you do it slow?  Because a lot of times a guy's going really quick, and I tap it. 
[02:35:00]  Could you go a teeny bit slower?  I'll ease it on you.  Yeah.  Is there some type of form you could sign, just in case I hurt a social injury?  No, please don't.  That's okay.  All right.  So a big part of this move, it's like you need a wall.  You need something behind the back.  It's like one of the choking points.  Oh, here I go.  What do you need me?  Bobby, I'll be at the wall here.  Oh, yeah.  Or the door.  Yeah, the door.  The wall.  It doesn't matter.  Why do we need the wall?  I don't like this.  Because it creates the pressure.  Oh, good.  Here's the UFC gloves.  I was going to ask John to sign before I was paralyzed. 
[02:35:30]  You let me choke you, I'll sign the gloves.  Oh, look at that.  See what we do?  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  He's got me.  John's standing in front of me, and he's dipping my head down to his midsection, and he has one  very large, strong hand under my neck, and one very large, strong hand on top of my head.  Hang on.  Let me get my zipper down.  Heck yeah.  I'm ready to offer him my desserts. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  You ready?  Okay, yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  How was that, Jimmy?  Wow.  But he did it really slow.  Thank you.  He did it really slow, and for a second, I was like, oh, I can hang with this.  You should have kept it going.  I should have.  No, I would have passed out.  And then he went.  Wow.  He makes this sound like a fucking beaver that's in danger.  Oh, man, no. 
[02:36:30]  That was fucking brutal.  Yeah.  That's why I wanted to feel it slow, and you'd feel the pressure, and then it gets to a point.  It creeps up on you quick.  But once it's at that point, which is probably about a second into it, you're finished.  And if you had just gone full strength, you wouldn't have taken that one.  Can you do a rear naked on me?  I've never had a rear naked on you.  Oh, absolutely.  Here we go.  Can you get your arms around?  All right.  What are we doing here?  A rear naked?  Be ready to tap.  Okay.  Be ready to tap?  Really?  Yeah.  A rear naked?  All right.  Go.  I'm going to take my gum off.  I'm going to spit it on John. 
[02:37:00]  I'm going to get mad after you.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Let's go.  Here we go.  Go.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Bobby's down.  He's out.  Get out of here.  You're right, Bobby.  You're right, Bobby.  You're right?  I did feel his neck popping a little bit, though.  Chuck.  Chuck is sick.  Oh, I love it.  Did you feel the crack?  He cracked something.  Was he tapping?  I didn't know who was tapping. 
[02:37:30]  I don't know if he was tapping or his neck was popping.  Did you hear the crack?  Oh, yeah.  Dude, you need to go see your chiropractor.  Something went...  He adjusted, yeah.  He gave me an adjustment.  Hey, don't send me the chiropractor, Bill.  Oh, shit.  You all right?  Oh.  Wow, that was fucking...  But that's disturbing.  You're helpless.  Let me tell you what happens.  You fucking forget what to do.  Really?  Or you guys don't know what to do.  Yeah.  Oh, I do.  Tap.  It squeezes, and then I heard a crack, and I was like, what's that?  And then I felt the lights going out, and I go, tap, Bobby. 
[02:38:00]  Tap the lights.  The lights are going out?  I started tapping.  Well, he was tapping.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  I'm not like this.  The lights are going out, though?  Yeah.  It starts...  It just starts going like this, and your mouth starts...  But the thing is, you kept your arms by your fucking waist like a dumbbell.  I start with my hands up in tap position.  You're fucking...  You're Kenny Casual.  Just relax.  Hey, maybe I'll peruse a magazine.  While he's choking me.  My hands should be there, man.  Well, I'm not a professional choker. 
[02:38:30]  Tapper, you mean?  Yeah, I'm not a tapper outer.  But what's important, because it's radio, the video will show that Jon Jones is like,  fuck you tapping.  Put the video on the tour.  Oh, it'll be up.  Trust me, it will.  The last one did amazing.  The last one went everywhere.  Yeah, that Bobby one is going to be really fucking funny.  Because you're tapping like a motherfucking Jon Jones.  Yeah, I'm like, fuck that.  You hurt...  You felt...  At first, I didn't know that your neck popped or what.  My neck actually feels better.  He runs panicking that he's got to go.  Thank you.  Thank you.  They're getting rambunctious out there.  Yeah, you got other shows to do, I guess. 
[02:39:00]  Can we ask you to sign a glove?  Uh, no.  We'll take a break.  Listen, we love when you come in here.  I mean...  I want to take a real light punch.  I don't want to take a hard one, though.  Take it.  Just take the punch.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait, wait, wait.  No.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No.  Hold on.  Just a light one.  Just a light one.  Wait.  Oh!  Oh!  Hold on.  Wait, wait, wait, no.  That's going to fucking bruise.  It's not going to bruise.  It's not going to bruise.  It's not going to bruise.  He's the light heavyweight champion.  Yeah, of course it's going to bruise.  Don't try to psych... 
[02:39:30]  It didn't happen if we don't do it on video.  I can't fucking...  All right.  A punch from Jon Jones to Jim Norton.  Oh!  Shit!  Oh!  That was a...  Wow!  That was a hard one.  Wow!  Thank God I'm a righty.  Holy shit!  That's why I get in the left arm.  I'm going to have to be in for you for a while.  No, I'm a righty.  My right arm is good.  Man, he aimed that one, too.  Like, let me get right...  Bam!  What does that look like?  I'll tell you what it feels like.  It feels like a cartoon... 
[02:40:00]  Oh, is it throbbing?  The left one.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Oh, God.  You're already bruised.  Oh, it's starting already.  You see me pull away like a girl?  I can see, like, a fist print just starting to...  Wow, that...  Oh, man.  Let me tell you something.  That is some fucking...  That's...  He's a goddamn man.  You want him again?  I don't want to get hit again.  I can't take it again.  Holy shit.  It's bruising me.  Yeah, that's great.  What percent was that? 
[02:40:30]  That was about a 70.  Oh, man.  That was about a 70.  Wow.  What did that feel like hitting?  Like a bag of pudding?  No, I...  Like a rice...  Really compact rice pudding.  Rice pudding.  But he hit me...  A bag of maggots.  Jesus, that would get so humiliating.  A bag of rice was nice, but maggots implied worminess.  What are you talking about?  He choked my fat body up and let me fall to the floor gently.  That was a good shot in the left arm, but I tightened up just so it wouldn't just hit  the bone.  That was fucking a good shot. 
[02:41:00]  Wow.  He really hit you.  Yeah.  No, I'm glad you did.  I wouldn't say I liked it.  But, uh...  That was solid.  That's what that was.  We fucking love John Jones.  Love John Jones, man.  All right.  This is just getting weird.  We're all about John Jones.  We just want to get beaten up by John Jones.  What's wrong with us?  Thanks for coming.  Someone's having a weird S&M plug.  I know, right?  Hi, John.  I've been very bad.  What's the matter with me? 
[02:41:30]  I think we sold a lot of games today.  Yes.  UFC 3 Undisputed, available today on Xbox and PS3.  Yes.  And, of course, Johnny Bones on Twitter.  Fuck, we love to come by.  Yes, the great John Jones.  Good times, man.  And I'm not even going to say good luck with Rashad Evans.  We're all about John Jones in this fight.  Yes.  No good luck needed.  You guys should play Do the Stinky Leg.  Do the Stinky Leg.  It's Rashad's anthem.  Oh, really?  Is it?  How are you doing there, Jimmy?  I'm okay, but I want to see it.  It's going to brew us quickly.  Oh, it is.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  Get some ice on that thing.  I actually feel better.  Like, I feel like straight. 
[02:42:00]  Do you feel better?  Send him a bill.  You gave him an adjustment.  Oh, anytime.  That's what I'm here for, guys.  Were you really passing out?  Yeah, well, I was still conscious.  I didn't go up totally, but I couldn't hold myself up anymore because I'm so fat.  Next time we come in, we'll have to sign some waivers and we can have some real fun.  Oh, man.  No, I'll never do that again.  I'll never do that again.  You'll never do that again?  No, that was fucking...  That scared you.  That reminded me of...  Too close to death?  He thought he was back in jail.  Yeah, his stepfather. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, that reminded me of my youth.  You know, you're late.  Oh, poor guy.  All right, John has to go.  They're going to keep killing us.  They're now officially mad at us.  All right.  Whatever.  Great John Jones.  We love you.  Thank you, John Jones.  Johnny Bones on Twitter, everyone.  Thank you.  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  On the next American War Stories, Battleground, Iraq, Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant realizes no man can prepare for war. 
[02:43:00]  We thought we were going to starve, so we brought little bars and stuff.  There's going to be no food.  I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  There was...  You go to the buffet, there's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza, ice cream.  You can walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and Sundays as you want. 
[02:43:30]  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more.  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly.  I broke my knee, man!  On the next American War Stories.  Who's that old guy over there? 
[02:44:00]  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love ya.  On today's episode, Uncle Paul reminisces about going to a baseball game.  We saw Joe DiMaggio pop into a double play in Ebbets Field.  Back when I was your age, we didn't have all these goddamn blacks in the game. 
[02:44:30]  I would always go to the ball game there.  Have a hot dog.  Get to know somebody.  You go to the bathroom, nobody would say nothing if there was a couple of you in a stall.  He never went to the polo grounds.  I had a misunderstanding with a youngster.  I thought that he was stealing one of the little baseball bats.  So I took him into the men's room.  Searched him.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul. 
[02:45:00]  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Cause here comes Uncle Paul.  3XM.  The OP-N-3 Show.  We haven't stopped laughing. 
[02:45:30]  That last five minutes of radio was just unbelievable.  We got video that'll be all over the fucking place later today.  But holy shit was that funny.  Bobby, in the video I took of Bobby, you're tapping like a motherfucker.  And John Jones knows it.  He's like, look, if we're making a video, we're going to make a fucking video, boys.  Yeah, he don't mess around.  And then you fall to the floor and he had to kind of make sure you weren't going to hit  your head or anything.  Yeah, thank God he didn't machete at me.  And then he machete at fucking Norton.  And Bobby's got an amazing video of a close-up of Norton's face. 
[02:46:00]  My throat hurts.  My throat's really sore.  My, he cracked, you guys got your asses kicked.  I'm swallowing and it hurts badly.  My neck, he, I heard cracking in my neck.  I thought he was breaking my neck.  And that's why I panicked.  And then I forgot that I had to tap.  And then I started tapping and then I was losing.  I couldn't tap hard enough because the light was going away.  Well, who made the point that like when Jimmy does this, he's ready to tap.  He knows, okay.  Me.  I made the point.  Yeah, sorry.  I told him. 
[02:46:30]  Sorry.  Yeah, I told you, Bobby.  It's like, yeah, yeah.  But.  Yeah, you really have to be ready.  I mean, like, I just took a choke.  You really have to be ready to fucking tap.  It happened so quickly.  How many more seconds did you have before you were out?  Not, not.  A couple seconds?  He let go as he was letting me down.  If he didn't do that.  You were getting the lights.  I was going to wake up with a numb mouth and fucking drooling.  Now, you said you heard some crackling in your neck, Bobby.  Yeah, he, there's something wrong with my neck and now the left nostril that I usually 
[02:47:00]  can't breathe out of is, I can smell mint.  Oh, you know what?  I'll tell you why he cleared your sinuses.  You're smelling mint?  Here's why he cleared your sinuses.  It's adrenaline.  It's like, it's like, almost like if you get scared really quick, like if a car, like  you step out of the street in a car, your body, adrenaline, when you're ready for battle,  your body opens you up like that.  And that's what that was.  Your body sensed that you needed to breathe.  Dr. Jim.  What happens is it'll take the side of the fluid and it'll push it back through your  septum.  And just for breathing purposes, there's a big Frankenstein next to me. 
[02:47:30]  Either that or you're bleeding to death right now.  Oh, yeah.  What do you want us to do?  Yeah.  If I pass out and die, you take my phone and you fucking step on it, cut it in half and  then burn it.  That's all I need you to do.  Okay.  I don't want my wife.  Here's your husband's phone.  Who are these men you've been talking to?  She'll go, I don't, where's his phone?  I just want his phone.  What does this file mean?  We don't know where his phone went.  I'm sorry, Dawn.  It might be in the Hudson River.  I don't know. 
[02:48:00]  It might be only at Skuma Divers.  He's a fun guest, Johnny Jones.  Love him.  Fucking love him.  But I like, I was saying, I like Rashad a lot too.  He was also a very fun guest and a very cool dude, man.  A funny guy.  And I'm telling you, Rashad is going to, he's not, he's going to be a problem.  I think he's going to be one of the toughest guys he fights.  And he actually said it too, but he's going to be one of the toughest guys he fights.  Yeah.  God damn.  Those guys are just men.  What the fuck happened to me?  My shitty genetics.  Real men.  Just a fucking man.  You're funny.  That's why guys like that aren't, aren't normally being funny. 
[02:48:30]  I was laughing.  No.  I was laughing at his hijinks.  He was.  I mean, I don't mean John per se.  I mean, in general, you got the, you got the gift of being funny and they get the gift  of procreating, continuing the species while you dance around in jester shoes.  You're eating a banana right next to me, homo.  I know, Bob.  No, Bob.  Let him have his moment, please.  I know.  It was a nice moment. 
[02:49:00]  I try to add sometimes.  You were tagging.  I try to, I try to tag to the funny and sometimes it doesn't work.  I don't have his moment.  I'm sorry.  My Bob's like, and Jimmy, of course, taking a 70% punch.  Yeah.  From John Jones.  Yeah, that's not, that wasn't fucking fun.  I got that on video too.  You can actually, you hear the sound after he punches like you're in the bleachers at a  Yankees game.  That was a good punch.  Dude, that fucking.  That was so fucking solid.  So quick and fast.  And he hit Jimmy's face and Jimmy's eyes go completely round. 
[02:49:30]  He hit his eye.  You just knew too.  It didn't make a smack sound.  You know when you fucking tee up a golf ball and you drive it and it makes that perfect  sound?  Thud.  That's what a punch is supposed to sound like.  Not like a smack or a slap.  It was a thud like solid.  Yeah, he hit bone.  He bruised bone.  Imagine hitting, getting that in the face.  70% punch like that.  I don't have the guts.  Are you kidding me? 
[02:50:00]  Your jaw would be broken.  Could you imagine though getting that in the stomach?  That's how Houdini died, you know.  We all know.  Don't take a gut punch.  God damn.  Imagine taking that in the fucking gut.  No.  I have pretty good stomach muscles.  Hey, we got the sound of Jimmy being punched because we were all laughing so hard.  I want to hear it now.  And we got you being choked out.  I got to hear these sounds again.  Which one you got first, Ero?  Uh, first one we'll do is Jimmy being choked. 
[02:50:30]  All right.  Here we go.  Wow.  That's a good one.  Want to hear it again?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  It's a baby Chewbacca being born.  And you don't have Bobby being choked because he was more like losing his life.  No, I don't have that, but I have Jim being punched now.  Yeah, let's hear this.  From John Jones to Jim Norton.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Fuck.  Fuck that.  How's your arm? 
[02:51:00]  It's fine.  Just saying that?  No.  He hit you just right then, I guess, huh?  He hit me hard.  Right.  My arm was okay after Frankie Edgar, too, and Derek Hill, it'll be very sore.  You're not going to be able to jerk off later.  I'm a righty, of course I will.  No, I'm talking about the other guy's cock.  The funny part is that he doesn't think I would suck it.  Jimmy's the recovering kid.  Just put it in my mouth.  I can't hold it.  My arm's hurt. 
[02:51:30]  My arm is sore.  Again?  Well, you know.  Hey, is the tallest basketball player here yet?  We would know in a second.  Why?  Do you see ceiling tiles falling out?  He's just cutting through him with his neck as he wants.  Down the hallway.  Yeah.  He's 7'8".  Everyone has seen our pictures with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  This guy's 6 inches taller than that.  That's craziness.  And Kareem had to duck when he walked in that door. 
[02:52:00]  So this guy is just going to be that Close Encounters monster.  It's so weird.  What is his house has to be different?  His car has to be different.  I would think.  Holy fuck.  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  Are you serious?  Look, I can't stop laughing.  I can't stop laughing.  Bring him in.  Holy death.  This guy is fucking...  Yes.  You rang.  It's Tiny Sturgis from the Harlem Globetrotters entering the studio.  How you doing, man?  Holy shit.  Hi, Tiny. 
[02:52:30]  What's going on?  Are we allowed to talk about your height or do you get mad at that?  Whatever you want to talk about, we'll do it.  All right.  Take a seat, Tiny.  Hi, buddy.  How are you?  Holy mackerel.  Hi, buddy.  Tiny Sturgis from the Harlem Globetrotters.  Pleasure to meet you.  You too, my man.  Hello.  Oh, napkin.  Yeah.  Tiny, we just had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in here last week.  Oh, yeah?  How was he?  He was awesome.  Yeah, he was pretty good.  And we thought he was tall.  He was 7'2".  He's still pretty big.  Yeah.  He's a legend right there. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Now, you play...  Are you an item nursing you play?  Like, are you a really good player?  Are you mostly, like, you know, defense and rebounding?  Or are you...  I do a little bit of everything.  A lot of people don't expect to see the talents I have when they see me play basketball.  They just assume I'm a tall guy.  But I can run up and down good, shoot the ball good.  So, yeah.  Did you have a college career?  I played at a small college in West Virginia.  We actually did really good. 
[02:53:30]  We lost in a tournament last year and run us up.  But it was a small career.  He won a big-time D1 or nothing like that.  Did you get recruited with Division I's or...?  I played basketball in England.  So, obviously, basketball isn't big over there.  So, I knew, like, somebody knew the coach at the university I was at.  And he offered me, and I just came right out.  But knowing what I know now, I probably would have pursued a big-time D1.  And, I mean, no doubt I would have ended up somewhere.  Yeah, sure.  How long have you been with the Globetrotters?  My first year. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, it is.  Yeah, rookie year.  Part of a rookie class we have and having a great time.  Are you guys having a good season?  You're winning some games?  Yeah.  We haven't lost yet, so...  Oh, wow.  That's pretty good.  That's good.  Can we get another chair up for...  What's your name?  I'm sorry.  Yeah, we got flight time back here.  Let him sit here.  I'm going to move over here.  It's all good.  That's flight time.  Holy shit.  What's up, flight time?  The legend that is flight time in the house.  What's up, guys?  How are you, buddy?  Hey, I'm good.  Thanks for having us.  No worries. 
[02:54:30]  Crowley Neal is going around.  Was he only around yesterday, too?  I think it's weird.  Like, when I was a kid, I still watched the Globetrotters.  I remember him and Meadowlark.  There aren't many guys I remember by name.  Telling your age.  I know.  This is my 13th year.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  13 years over 90 countries.  Did it for a while.  I've been doing it for a while.  Did you ever see...  Kareem did a documentary on the Rens.  The Rens.  And then he was talking about the Harlem Rens, the Globetrotters being...  Actually, the Chicago Globetrotters where they first started. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, the Globetrotters started in Chicago.  They were never from Harlem.  A guy by the name of Abe Saperstein actually founded the Globetrotters back in 26.  And the reason why he used the name Harlem is because back in the 20s, the Harlem Renaissance  was really big and black entertainment was really big.  So he wanted people to know that they were coming to see a black basketball team.  And you guys are like a legitimate team.  You're legitimate players.  Like, there's a lot of fun tricks and things that you guys do on the court.  But how come you didn't go forward into the NBA?  I imagine the money would be better there.  Oh, well, for myself, I grew up as a kid.  I wanted to play, you know, professional sports or basketball. 
[02:55:30]  The Globetrotters gave me an opportunity.  Once I got an opportunity with the Globetrotters, I never pursued anything else.  And I don't have any regrets.  I mean, there's not another team that I could say I could play with and been to 90 different  countries around the world and haven't had to pay for any transportation.  And to have the opportunity to go out and make kids smile and, you know, families have  a great time is more than a dream come true.  And you can't put a price tag on that.  How about yourself?  Did you think of joining the NBA at all?  Or did you have...  Same as flight time.  I mean, as soon as I finished college, I was looking at several options, playing professional 
[02:56:00]  basketball.  And as soon as the Globetrotters pursued me, this is something I want to be doing.  And I'm having a great time doing that.  Do you do a lot of tricks as well?  Again, and I don't mean to say it like tricks, but there really are.  It's a...  Yeah, there's tricks.  It's amazing.  There's nothing wrong with saying that.  I could never learn to spin a ball on my finger.  I could spin a ball on my finger.  Could you?  Yeah.  Because my right hand is usually moving in one direction.  I've actually never been able to keep my...  You know.  And I've never been able to spin a ball on my finger. 
[02:56:30]  Could you do that for him flight time?  Yeah, I can't do that.  Pull your finger up.  I'm only 43.  That's all right.  Here we go.  This is what the Globetrotters do.  They make magic happen.  All right.  I'm holding my pointer finger up.  I'm not looking at the ball because if I look...  See?  As soon as he moves his hand, it goes away.  One more.  Here we go.  All right.  This time you got it.  Come on.  Focus, Jimmy.  Do it right.  There you go.  You got it.  Oh, I got it.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  There we go.  A boyhood dream.  We can make 43-year-olds' dreams come true.  But how embarrassing. 
[02:57:00]  As soon as he moved his hand, the ball just went, fuck this, and fell off.  God, am I uncoordinated.  Hey, have you ever seen the Harlem Globetrotters cartoon from years ago?  Actually, yeah.  Yeah, I did.  They had the van with the court on the roof of the van.  Used to always, even as a kid, I'd watch them and go, you can't put a basketball court  on the roof of a van.  They had the afros, too.  We need a ladder.  And he'd pull a ladder out of his afros.  Yeah, yeah.  He stored stuff in his afro.  That was Sweet Lou Dunbar.  Sweet Lou Dunbar. 
[02:57:30]  Scooby-Doo.  Scooby-Doo, yeah.  Yeah, Scooby-Doo.  Yeah.  Who are the other guys?  There was Metal Ark, Curly Neal.  I forgot about Sweet Lou Dunbar.  Keith Osby.  Keith Osby.  Keith Osby.  Holy shit.  Right.  Who else?  Marcus Haynes.  Oh, I forgot those names.  Marcus Haynes, of course.  Rich History.  Yeah.  You guys bring any of them back?  Actually, Curly Neal, he still works with us.  He still does a lot of promotional stuff for us.  But Metal Ark Lemon, he's a traveling evangelist.  But the guys who got on the court today, Tiny, myself, Flight Time, the stars that take  over for those guys. 
[02:58:00]  You've got Big Easy, who was on the amazing race with myself.  Two Seasons.  You've got Special K, who also does what Curly Neal does, is the court gestures on the court.  Right, right, right.  When you think it's going to be a bucket of water, but it's only confetti, tee, throw  it in front of the audience.  You never know.  Oh, yeah.  Sometimes it is water.  They tried it early on with hydrochloric acid.  It didn't really go over well with the kids.  You've got to stop putting rocks in the bucket.  It's ruining everybody's fun.  You're 7'8"?  Yeah, that's right.  So I'm 7'8".  It makes me the tallest basketball player in the world right now. 
[02:58:30]  In the Guinness Book of Records.  Pretty cool.  At what point did you, when you were, you were, not that Guinness.  It actually is.  It's the same company, yeah.  Yeah, but you can't drink it.  Thanks, Bob.  At what point did you start getting, like, really big, and, like, how, did it suck?  Like, I mean, it's fun for sports, but when you're, you know, when you're 14 and you're  trying to pick up girls and you're 15, it's like, does it help or hurt?  Do you have to pick them up? 
[02:59:00]  I grew a foot when I was 16.  How'd you walk before that?  It worked out pretty good to me.  Everything's healthy.  Never had back pain or joint pain or anything like that.  Touch wood.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  So you were relatively normal size until 16?  I was.  I was probably the tallest side of my class, but...  But nothing extraordinary at that point.  Nothing extraordinary, yeah.  What'd you go from what to what when you were 16? 
[02:59:30]  Probably, like, 5'9", no, probably, like, 5'10", 5'11", to, like, 6'10", 6'11".  Wow.  And then you just kept going?  Then it was, like, gradual after that, and then finally stopped at 7'8".  How hard is it?  Like, I should have asked Kareem this, and I forgot.  Well, he doesn't like talking about his height.  Yeah, you can tell he's a little tired of talking about it.  He's just going to talk about the millions of points he's scored.  Yeah.  38,000.  38,000.  38,000-something plus.  Yeah.  Do you...  How hard is it, like, just going on the road in hotels and stuff and sleep in a bed when 
[03:00:00]  you're flying?  Like, the little things that every...  People typically take for granted.  Yeah, um...  Like, the little things people take for advantage.  Like, every time you walk through a door, you have to imagine I duck under that.  Hmm.  Like, sleeping in a bed isn't bad.  Um...  Get king-size bed and sleep corner to corner.  Like, that's surprisingly comfortable.  I don't have a problem sleeping.  Um...  Driving cars, pretty tough.  Um...  Showering.  Flying.  Flying, yeah.  Um...  The airlines are normally accommodated, though, like, exit rows or first class, something  like that. 
[03:00:30]  But you can't sit in the window seat, either, because of the round...  That's true.  Yeah.  I'm normally in the aisle, which stinks sometimes, because, obviously, I get bumped every time  people walk by me.  Oh, man.  But, I mean, it's not too much of a problem.  Like, we're normally accommodated really, really well.  As soon as they see the Harlem Globetrotters.  Yeah, yeah.  So, it's pretty cool.  What's the worst thing you've ever heard in a movie theater when you sat down from the person  behind you?  Um...  I don't pay attention.  If people make noise, it's too bad.  It's not my fault.  They need to move around me. 
[03:01:00]  I mean, it's...  Like, there's nothing I can do about it.  That would be hilarious.  It's like, oh, brother.  Really?  Watch your kid seeing Harry Potter and he comes in.  I sit down, and I'm about to sit here, so you might not be able to see, so...  Damn.  It is what it is.  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  Uh, United Kingdom.  Greatest country in the world.  Ah.  Except for...  He doesn't know where he's at right now.  Yeah.  Okay.  Second greatest now.  No.  And how often do you guys play?  I would go to England in a second.  I love England.  I wouldn't want to live there, but I would love to go there, because the tax rates are 
[03:01:30]  a little different.  I love them.  They have the best gangsters, too.  A lot of pubs.  You could get Guinness.  Not that kind.  He's stuck on Guinness.  Yeah, you go to Ireland.  You need to go to Ireland.  Yeah.  That's all connected.  How many days a year do you guys play?  Well, actually, we play pretty much every day.  We actually kicked off the States tour on Christmas, and we've been going every day since  then.  We go all the way up until the middle of April, and this weekend, we're all over the United  States.  We're mostly in New York and L.A. this weekend with shows at the Meadowlands, at the Izot 
[03:02:00]  Center, Prudential Center, Master Square Garden, two shows in Long Island.  So, I mean, we're busy.  So you're never home?  Actually, I mean, every year is different.  I've been doing it for 13 years, and I've had some years where I've played, you know,  six months and been off six months.  I've had some where I've gone 10 months and only had two off.  So it just depends a lot on our international tours.  I mean, the Globe Charters, in our 86-year history, we've been to over, I mean, just about  120 different countries and territories around the world.  What was your favorite country that you visited?  My favorite.  Some of my favorite countries to go to.  I mean, I enjoy it. 
[03:02:30]  I mean, you'd be surprised.  I mean, I enjoy going to South America, Brazil, Argentina, those places like that.  They love basketball.  Spain, actually, even Canada.  I mean, I find some of the nicest people in the world that actually live right across  the border, you know, in Canada.  But everywhere we go, we're in the home team, so they treat us good, and so it doesn't really  matter where we go.  And did you play college ball?  I don't know.  Yeah, I went to Centenary College down in Shreveport, Louisiana.  Probably the most popular player to come from there besides myself is Robert Parrish, the  chief that used to play for the Celtics.  Yeah, of course.  I love Parrish.  Do you remember the chief?  Oh, I love Parrish. 
[03:03:00]  The chief.  It's great.  Never smiled.  Even winning all those championships, he never smiled.  What is he thinking?  The old Boston Garden, I used to go see the Globetrotters all the time.  The old Boston Garden was terrible, too.  Just like a straight drop down.  You're up where the AC is.  He was just bang on the fucking, the top of the building.  Fucking nuts.  How tall the guy are you?  I'm 6'3".  That's unbelievable.  And you look like, next to Tiny, you look like I look next to you.  I don't know why I had to say that, but I didn't realize you were that big a guy. 
[03:03:30]  I mean, yeah, but for those people who don't really can have an idea of what you look like,  you can go to our website.  We got our YouTube page.  We got our Facebook page.  TalkingGlobetrotters.com.  You can figure out where we are in the world.  We got some nice videos.  We were actually at the Empire State Building yesterday and ran to a bunch of crazy British  people there, which I'm very happy to see Tiny.  It was a pretty cool experience.  Are they all new here?  I don't think they knew me, but as soon as I said, I'm from the UK.  You love the UK, don't you?  Do you get tired of talking about your height?  Like, it's got to be like a right already. 
[03:04:00]  We know I'm tall.  Is it like, do you get sick of hearing about it?  No.  People are curious and love to answer questions.  As long as you don't ask me stupid stuff, it's fine.  Yeah.  I mean, as much as he gets asked about his height, they ask me how I get so good looking.  I guess that's got to be a burden.  See, you look like a guy that suffers with the same problem.  The good looking person.  I really do.  They ask, what's in my DNA that just makes this all work?  What brought all this together?  The mold was broken.  Yeah, there's really something just special about this. 
[03:04:30]  He looks like a mold.  Do you live in the UK now or do you live here?  No, I live in the UK still.  Come over here.  Did you just answer that for him?  Yeah, I was joking.  Yeah, stay in the UK, fly out here to do tours and stuff like that whenever I'm on the road.  So it's great to have the opportunity.  I mean, that's another thing that coach has done.  They've accommodated me like that way.  So, I mean, it's just a great organization to be a part of. 
[03:05:00]  Do you date a lot or do you have one study that you kind of stay with?  I'm kind of too busy for dating right now.  I'm traveling a lot and stuff.  Can I imagine girls, because girls are like anybody who's different.  Anybody who's a different vibe to them, women kind of.  Is that how you get all your girls?  Yes.  Oh, man.  They think I'm an otter or they fuck me.  You make the noise of one. 
[03:05:30]  He's kind of cute.  I got a basketball question.  Can you dunk without jumping?  Well, tippy toes.  Tippy toes?  I got to jump a little bit.  I can grab the rim on my tippy toes, so I got to jump like about an inch or so to get the ball over.  And how tall was Manute Ball?  I was trying to figure it out today.  7'6".  7'7".  7'6".  He's up there with me.  So you're the tallest of all time, then, I think.  Because I don't think...  Pretty much, yeah.  There was that kid, the white kid from Sean Bradley. 
[03:06:00]  Sean Bradley.  How tall was he?  7'7".  7'7".  7'6".  7'6".  So you're the tallest of all time, then.  Could you block the skyhook without goaltending?  I don't know.  Skyhook was pretty unstoppable.  It was, right?  I don't think anybody could ever block the skyhook.  Unless he got it coming right out of his hand, right?  I could.  Yeah.  I could do it.  No.  What's your shot?  My hook shot's pretty good.  Like, I shoot jump shots pretty good, too.  But I normally live and die off the hook shot.  I can use both hands, too.  Oh, you can. 
[03:06:30]  Do guys think because you're a really tall guy, they're going to be able to muscle it on you?  Pretty much.  I mean, they kind of assume I'm slow running up and down the court.  They're trying to outspread me and stuff.  But that's not the case.  But obviously, if I come up against a shorter guy, I mean, they're quicker than me and stuff  like that.  But yeah, they definitely do try and be more aggressive, I mean.  Well, you don't seem...  Like, Manute Ball always seemed...  He was very thin and he always seemed like he was kind of a frail guy.  But you don't seem that way.  You're a big... 
[03:07:00]  330 pounds of pure chiseled mass.  Yes.  Because he's making a muscle in his right arm.  Is that what that was?  Muscle?  Okay.  It's pure.  It's chiseled under there.  Don't let the tracksuit fool you.  330?  330, yeah.  What do you think Manute weighed?  He didn't weigh 330 pounds.  He was like 270.  I think he was like 185 or something like that.  So you got Manute by about 60 pounds.  Yeah.  He was tiny, man.  When you saw him on the court, it was...  He could shoot the three, though.  Remember he should shoot three points?  He shot one.  No.  He shot one.  He shot one. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  No, he made like seven in the game one time, didn't he?  Yeah.  Really?  He used to step out and shoot a crazy-looking thing.  Got to YouTube it.  Yeah, all right.  He looked like a praying mantis.  I remember that.  He used to throw them over his head.  Yeah.  He was looking crazy.  I forgot about that.  You're right, though.  It's coming back to me.  One game where it was just completely ridiculous.  Who are you?  PR?  I handle the PR for the team.  Are we doing good?  Yeah.  Doing all right?  We're asking all the same shit that everyone else does on the show.  Oh, this is all new. 
[03:08:00]  It's new stuff.  We haven't heard any of these questions before.  Oh, you gave me my tickets, didn't you?  I got to be honest with that guy.  You going?  When are you going?  For your charity, man.  I got, yeah.  Of course a charity.  You're going when you're kidding, right?  10 tickets I asked for.  10 tickets?  I got to be nice to him.  Are you coming to Madison Square Garden?  I think we got Nassau Coliseum, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll see you guys there.  Nassau Coliseum.  Where am I in the garden?  I would love to go see you guys.  Garden is Saturday night.  Yeah.  Nassau Coliseum.  We have two shows there on Sunday.  Saturday night?  I actually play an early game Saturday in Newark. 
[03:08:30]  I'll be gone all weekend.  We play in Staples Center, too.  I mean, obviously you're nationwide.  Yeah.  We're in Staples Center this weekend with the other unit.  This weekend with the other unit.  Wait, you guys got two teams now?  Yeah.  We got about 28 total players, but we break off into two teams.  Do they get bummed if they don't get to see Tiny or Flight Time?  We got guys on these teams that are pretty well-known.  I mean, we got our first female player who's on one of our squads.  We got Big E, my partner from the Navy race.  You got to do a female player?  Yeah, we do.  We got our first female player in 20 years. 
[03:09:00]  Her name's TNT Maddox, which is what we call the TNT.  Her name's Fatima.  She played at the University of Temple, actually.  How tall is she?  Fatima, I think she's about 5'6 or 5'7, something like that.  That's pretty cool.  Little girls, you see her line up at the autograph session.  Yeah, I would imagine.  We also have another guy on the team.  We call him, his name is Jonte Hall.  He's the shortest globetrotter ever, and we call him Too Tall.  How tall is he?  5'2".  What?  He's one of our dribblers.  He does kind of what Curly Neal back in the day, dribbling around.  How tall is Curly? 
[03:09:30]  Curly is probably about 6 feet.  Oh, he is?  Okay.  Yeah, but like I was saying, we got Tiny, and then we got Too Tall, and he's one of our  four-point shooters.  What's a four-point shot?  Four-point shot is something we introduced last year.  We introduced that.  It's about 12 feet behind the three-point line, and in the last three minutes of the quarter,  we start bombing away from three-point line.  We've also got last year's college slam dunk champion on our roster, who's another white  player, and his name's Jacob Tucker.  He won the college dunk contest last year, if you guys ever had a chance to watch that 
[03:10:00]  at the Final Four.  He's 5'10 with a 50-inch vertical.  5'10".  Wow!  Is that big?  50-inch vertical?  50-inch vertical.  White man can jump.  What was David Thompson?  He had an amazing jump.  I don't think it was 50 inches, though.  You don't think?  That's crazy.  No.  Because they used to brag about his vertical.  There's not too many people out there that can say they've got a 50-inch vertical.  What's Jordan's vertical?  For relative comparison, I don't know.  I never know.  He could just fly.  Yeah, no kidding.  Who's the second-tallest guy on the team?  Stretch.  Stretch Middleton.  He's 7'4".  Holy shit. 
[03:10:30]  We've got a couple.  There's three 7-footers on the team.  We've got me, Stretch, and there's Anthony Biggie McClain.  University of Cincinnati.  University of Cincinnati.  He's 7'1".  So there's a couple big guys on the team.  We've got some size.  Remember Metal Ark Lemon throwing that hook from the stands?  Definitely, yeah.  I think that was on Wide World of Sports or something back in the day.  All of a sudden, they're like, watch what he could do.  That's what Big E's and Special K do now.  They throw the hook.  From wherever?  From like half-court, three-quarter-court.  Did they ever make it?  Yeah. 
[03:11:00]  And how about the four-point?  People make the four-point shots?  Yeah, the four-point shot, like I said.  I mean, some of our better four-point shooters.  We've got a guy named Firefly.  We've got a guy named Bones.  We've got Slick Willie Shaw from St. John's.  We've got some great four-point shooters.  I mean, if we're going to put it in the game, we've got to be able to make a few of them, you know?  Do you guys ever play, I guess I don't want to say a real basketball team, but a traditional basketball team, like an NBA team?  Would you guys fare well against them?  Well, actually, when I joined the team about 13 years ago, we used to play against colleges.  And we'd go overseas and play, you know, different professional teams like that. 
[03:11:30]  But we don't play so much overseas and more against professional teams.  And the NCAA eliminated, you know, the professional teams or touring teams playing against colleges.  So we just, you know, it's basically back to entertaining, good family fun.  And, I mean, we've still got some of the best basketball players in the world.  But at the same time, with being a Globetrotter, you have to be a good basketball player.  You've got to be able to interact with different people of all walks of life.  And you've got to have personality.  What's the name of the team that you guys play all the time?  The Washington Generals. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, yep.  Now, can you do the thing?  It's always amazed me how somebody can take the ball and roll it down one arm over the shoulder over the other arm.  Yeah, you want to say a little something?  I would like to, yeah.  Because it's just a...  I know this doesn't play well on the radio, but I'm just being a child and enjoying this.  You really?  Look at that.  He's got the ball going all over his body.  Yeah, it's all the stuff you see.  Rolling around.  Rolling around the shoulders.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  That's fucking unbelievable.  I don't feel like describing it today.  He's just...  Picture...  Picture...  Just trust me.  Here's what he's doing.  He's standing there, and he had his arms out, making his arms like in front of him in a circle. 
[03:12:30]  And the ball was kind of...  It was like rolling around the outside of a glass.  Yeah.  But the glass was your arms and shoulders in a circular.  That was very impressive.  I can't wait to see you guys.  I haven't...  I don't think I've ever been to the Harlem Globetrotters.  I went many years ago when I was a kid, and I was so mad.  I'm like, where the fuck is Curly Neal?  I didn't say that because it was my father.  I was like, where's Curly Neal?  And then he took the wig off.  I was like, oh, he got me.  What else do you guys do that, you know, maybe people that remember the Harlem Globetrotters  from many years ago, what's different? 
[03:13:00]  You've named a few of them.  I mean, you never know what's going to happen at a Globetrotter game.  And if you come, you'll see kids that have signs up like, pick me, because we're always  going to the crowd.  We pick kids out.  We spin the ball on their fingers.  We let them take shots.  We might snatch a lady's purse.  We might pull a man out to dance.  It's just unpredictable.  And a lot of people don't believe that it's not staged.  We just randomly go and get people.  I never got picked as a kid.  Oh, man.  Ever.  I had that same look.  I never got picked for anything.  I went to see you guys three times, and each time I was like, they're going to pick me  today.  I used to look. 
[03:13:30]  I used to try to make eye contact, and they just go right around me.  Exactly.  They were uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I never got picked.  Yeah.  Because you were 37.  They pulled Duchovny out on the court two years ago at the Garden.  Duchovny?  Yeah.  They got Duchovny out there.  Our showman at the time was Highlight Bruton, and Flight Time wasn't at this game.  He was on the other unit, and he didn't want to go out.  But he was there with his kids, T. Leone, and he ended up coming out, and we got this 
[03:14:00]  picture that ended up going across the country, and he ends up going on David Letterman.  And Letterman's like, well, Duchovny, I got a question for you.  What is this?  And he pulls out the photo of Duchovny right behind the showman, and he's like, oh, I  love the Globetrotters.  You know, I had a great time, but I try not to do things like that because of photos  like this where I'm behind a big guy like that.  Are there a lot of celebrities at your games, or no?  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I mean, like I said, in New York, Madison Square Garden this weekend, and definitely in L.A. 
[03:14:30]  In Los Angeles, we have all kinds of celebrities.  I mean, Drew Carey shows up.  Yeah, we have a lot of celebrities show up in L.A. and New York bringing their kids,  regulars.  I like the stuff.  Have you ever had a kid that you just like, it was just a, like I know, you're just like  a little pain in the ass.  You know, where you're like, oh, God.  Yeah, of course.  We never say it, though.  We just let them play it on out.  And like, man, we should pick the bad kid tonight.  But for the most part, I mean, they're pretty excited to be out there.  The little fat kid from Bad Santa. 
[03:15:00]  Just a million of you guys asking questions.  How do you make the ball go around?  And 95% of the time, though, they're excited.  And we explained to them that probably any kid in the arena would trade places with them  right, you know, at that moment.  So they didn't begin to realize it.  How long is the show?  The show is anywhere from an hour, 45 minutes to two hours.  And then after that, we have a free autograph session, which we sign autographs and we take  pictures and we get to meet our fans and shake hands.  Something that they don't have to pay extra for and something that probably most teams  and, you know, acts don't do. 
[03:15:30]  They're just nice guys.  Yeah, in the end.  Really nice.  That's why we've been around 86 years.  Huh?  Being a kid is going to see the Harlem Globetrotters.  Yeah, but a lot of entertainers, they don't take care of their audience like the Harlem Globetrotters do.  That's why we've been around 86 years.  I don't know why I thought that Metal Rock 11 and Curly Neal started at all.  I really am a dummy wrapped up in my own generation.  See, everybody thinks that because, you know, back in the 70s and 80s, that's when, you know,  Globetrotters reached the height of popular channels to watch.  Yeah, and it was on TV.  That's what I mean.  ABC and CBS.  Did anybody ever rent you?  Like, can they get a private? 
[03:16:00]  A private, you know, like a rich person?  Yeah, we do.  We do bar mitzvahs and all kinds of stuff.  Oh, you really got me on that.  Go to HarlemGlobetrotters.com.  Check it out.  Reserve the Globetrotters.  So you can rent the Globetrotters.  We do all.  Hey.  I mean, if you had enough money, you're like a rich person to say, come and do my party.  Maybe not even necessarily rich.  I mean, we do all kinds of things for charities and, you know, all kinds of events.  But, yeah, I've definitely, I've appeared at a few of the Misfahs and birthday parties and  things like that.  I want to go with Jimmy's point there.  Who was the first star of the Harlem Globetrotters?  I would probably say Reese Goose Tatum. 
[03:16:30]  Goose Tatum was probably the first real big Harlem Globetrotters star.  What year was that now?  Also, I don't know.  I don't remember exactly what the year was.  We started in 26.  I'm sure it was like shortly after that.  But we know Will Chamberlain also played a year with the Globetrotters.  Did he really?  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  He was the first Globetrotter actually to have his number retired.  And actually about four years ago at the Garden, I used to wear number 22.  They retired the number 22 because that's the number that Curly Neal wore.  And they retired in the ceremony at the Garden.  Did they retire Meadowlark or no?  Oh, they must have.  Yeah.  I think Meadowlark's number's retired as well. 
[03:17:00]  Hey, how many more years are you going to do flight time?  Me?  Well, I'm 35 now.  And hopefully I can pay at least until I'm 40.  I'm still pretty healthy.  And getting up and down the court pretty good.  I'm enjoying what I do.  So, you know.  And you want to do more TV?  I wouldn't mind.  Whatever comes up, I'm down for it.  I've been on quite a few shows.  People know me from The Amazing Race a couple times.  And people are calling for us to do it the third time.  We're already two-time losers.  I'm undefeated as a Globetrotter, but undefeated in the wrong column on The Amazing Race.  And at this point, you should know the world.  I know, right? 
[03:17:30]  But there's a little bit more to it than that.  I just like it, right?  What do you want to do?  You just want to play?  Tiny, you want to play ball for?  What do you want to do after you play ball?  Because you know you can only do that for X amount of years.  Yeah, that's right.  I'm going to try and play basketball for as long as possible.  I have a dream to become a teacher, actually.  Got a degree at university.  And then, I don't know.  What do you want to teach?  Physical Education, PE.  I'd definitely go back to England and do that.  But, I mean, who knows what could come?  I mean, so many opportunities come about from being with the Globetrotters. 
[03:18:00]  So, I mean, who knows what the future holds.  I could be a Globetrotter forever.  Were you scared the first time you played publicly?  I mean, they play in front of large audiences.  Yeah, I mean, I've played in front of large crowds before.  But this is like a different kind of pressure.  Obviously, the ball, we're known as the greatest ball handlers and stuff like that.  So, I had to learn all the different tricks and stuff like that where we do.  But, I mean, luckily, it was overseas, so I felt more in my environment because we was in France or somewhere like that. 
[03:18:30]  And, I mean, yeah, not looked back, really did well and got about 50-yard shows under my belt now.  What's the largest crowd you guys played in front of?  You two specifically.  Myself, personally, I can remember my first year on the team.  We traveled over to Sweden and we played and we did a doubleheader.  I think it was Malmore, Stockholm, in a place called The Globe and it held like 23,000 people.  So, for the first game, we had 23,000.  The second game, we had like 21,000.  This is all in the same day.  So, that's probably the largest crowd I can remember playing in front of. 
[03:19:00]  How many games a year would you say you played?  Well, between two tours, I mean, it were from 250 to 300 games.  We also do military tours.  I mean, I actually played on an aircraft carrier, Beard or Roosevelt.  They catapulted us out there and catapulted us off.  We spent the night, you know, and did a show.  Was that recently?  I mean, we go to military bases every year between Christmas and Thanksgiving.  But when I did this one, it was about three years ago.  It was a lot of fun, too.  It was about 4,000 troops there.  They cleared out the bottom hangar.  They dropped us down.  And as you're coming down, you can see all the troops standing around the court that they laid down. 
[03:19:30]  And they were going crazy.  They treat you great, right?  Oh, man, they love us.  I mean, it's great for us to be able to go over there and bring a little bit of home to them.  Some of those bases over there are like little cities.  And they never leave those bases.  So for us to be able to come and bring some home entertainment is definitely one of the highlights of my year each and every time we get a chance to do that.  Yeah, and you realize how unpleasant it is to be over there with just the weather.  And especially if you go to Iraq or Afghanistan, it's like it's hot.  Who the fuck wants to be here for a length of time?  This is awful. 
[03:20:00]  You can only imagine.  I mean, they do what they do.  They protect our countries.  And we'd like to give back.  So have you gone over yet?  Have you gone over yet from military?  No, I haven't.  I mean, I don't think I'm allowed because obviously I'm a United Kingdom citizen.  Oh, yeah.  So, I mean.  Do you camp down the ship?  Even though we're allies, they're still pretty strict about that.  So, unfortunately, I haven't had the opportunity.  I would love to do it, but.  Are you going to plug the guns up with a basketball?  Yeah, exactly.  What's the problem?  Let them on the boat. 
[03:20:30]  I'm sure they have their reasons.  You sent them to a British base.  Yeah.  But we tour the U.K. next month, too.  So, that's going to be a little homecoming.  Oh, that's nice.  Where can people see you guys?  Because I know I want to go.  I'm going to be in Atlanta this weekend, though.  But I would love to see the Globetrotters.  A lot of shows.  People who want to see us this weekend will be in Staples Center.  We'll be down in Anaheim.  We'll be in New York, Madison Square Garden.  We'll be in Ontario, California.  We'll be in Long Island.  We'll be in East Rutherford at the Isai Center, as well as the Prudential.  We're all over the place this weekend.  And if you want to find out more about our schedule, HarlemGlobetrotters.com. 
[03:21:00]  We've got a Facebook page.  You can like us.  You can see videos.  And you can just keep up where we are.  We always come to a city near you.  No matter where you are, we're going to be there.  Flight time knows his shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  13 years.  I got it covered.  They better be paying you a little extra for the marketing you do.  Are we good?  Yeah, I think we're good, man.  I think we leave at about 10 o'clock.  Yeah, we're about done.  Our show is over.  But I really want to go see the Globetrotters, man.  Sir, we do all right?  Anything else to mention?  Round two stars.  Bye, bye, what?  I didn't mean to interrupt with this.  No, I just fucking went around, man. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, we just came back.  It's okay.  You tell great stories, dude.  It was a good story, dude.  No, stop.  It's all good.  You had a great ending.  It's teasing you.  Thank God.  Here's a little joke story over here.  I'm going to get stomped.  I don't know what time does I'm talking.  It's all good.  It was fine.  Come on.  He was just teasing you.  It's just teasing you.  You gave me that story.  It was atrocious.  No, I'm kidding.  It was a good story.  Hey, don't worry.  We'll get you back when you come to the Globetrotters again.  I'm going to hide.  I'm going to hide.  Fuck that. 
[03:22:00]  Fuck that.  I'm hiding.  Watch that bucket of water.  Yeah.  See, that's when they use the real water.  Hydrochloric acid.  It's going to smell like popcorn, right, Jimmy?  All right.  What do we got?  So, yeah, you mentioned all the dates.  HarlemGlobetrotters.com to get tickets.  Tiny, thank you, man.  Flight time.  Thank you.  Thanks for having us.  Yeah, we're happy you guys came in.  It was, I don't know.  You still play Sweet Georgia Brown?  I saw half of them.  It still is.  Okay, just making sure.  You never know. 
[03:22:30]  I don't want to say I love Sweet Georgia Brown.  Can you give us a whistle?  I can't whistle anything.  For years, I've been looking at women just screaming, hey, you.  Bobby's been wanting to do this for everybody.  Bobby.  He looks like he's ready to do it.  Bobby, you know this one.  I'm a great whistler.  Come on, Bobby.  You were saying it earlier.  Just start it up a little.  There we go.  I think that's leaving the beaver.  Yeah, so.  All right, with that, we're out of here, I guess.  Bobby, you got anything?  Oh, you guys good?  I'm in Vegas next week, baby. 
[03:23:00]  Vegas, go to robertkellylive.com and check out the podcast.  All right.  This Friday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, I'll be in Atlanta at the Punchline, and I'm shooting  my one-hour special April 28th at the Ohio Theater in Cleveland.  Tickets, I will have information on tickets this week, but I think I'm going to do two  shows there and shoot my hour special.  Can I go?  Globe Charter's in Vegas Wednesday, too.  I want to see you, too.  Huh?  Okay.  I said Globe Charter's in Vegas Wednesday, too.  God, there's a lot of shows.  We're everywhere.  Yeah.  There's a lot of shows, man.  You come to our show, we come to yours. 
[03:23:30]  Wow.  Your show will be a lot better than mine.  I know, you're pretty entertaining.  Your show will have fun and laughter.  My show will just put me up there.  Just talking about how he's self-destructed in front of Steve Martin, like the fat-titted  idiot that I am.  All right.  Well, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  See how John Jones punched me in the arm before.  Are you guys from the UFC?  I see you're swollen.  Yeah, yeah.  He really gave me a great shot.  Did you drop down on the floor?  I didn't drop down, but it will bruise.  Wow, that's a nice bruise.  Imagine that on the jaw. 
[03:24:00]  That's what we were saying.  My jaw would break, and I would be unconscious.  It wouldn't even be fun.  My right cheek hurts.  Yeah, we're going to have...  My neck, my neck crack, there's something wrong with my right cheek.  We're chewing.  We're going to have some great video later.  Fucking great video.  I was fucking disgusted earlier.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Thank you for having me.  Thank you tomorrow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[03:24:30]  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  You bet it is.  Can I say something, Sam?  Opie.  I'm still packing up.  Of course you can.  I'm sorry about hanging up on you yesterday, by the way.  I don't give a fuck.  I didn't want to do that.  I want to praise myself on how nice I am.  Thank God.  I thought you were going to praise somebody else.  No, I want to praise myself because I didn't go there today. 
[03:25:00]  I was just thinking that you didn't.  Mars wanted me to ask Tiny, who's what?  Seven foot eight.  Yeah.  How big his dick was.  What?  And I want to praise how nice I was that I didn't go there.  Mars, that's what you wanted to know?  See, I show class every once in a while.  That's what you wanted to know?  It's a valid question.  I mean, is it proportional to the man's height?  Like, that's the first thing that you thought of?  No, actually not.  Mars wanted to know how big Tiny's cock was, but he didn't want to ask.  He wanted me to ask him.  Let me correct you.  We all wanted to know how big Tiny's cock was. 
[03:25:30]  And all of us were scared.  Yeah.  We all wanted to know, look, how big is that fucking cock?  Is it a big, delicious cock or is it short?  How come you didn't just throw the question out there?  Because I decided to be nice today.  Jimmy might say we're cowards, but I felt like just being a nice guy today.  Okay?  Can I be nice sometime, Sam?  If you were nice, you wouldn't have crucified the fucking, the little guy for telling what  was admittedly horrendous.  But we were all thinking it.  Yes.  He just walked back to his couch and he sat down and just hears you mumbling, what was 
[03:26:00]  that story?  What was that?  And then he made believe he had the most important email coming in on his phone.  He was texting a suicide note.  He would not look up.  No, why would he?  He was affected by that, Sam.  Yes, it bothered him.  Because he doesn't, he's not.  Well, you're all, we're thinking it.  Why can't we say the shit we think?  Because he thought this was just like a hang and he was actually hanging with the guys.  Like he was at the cool kids table for a second.  Right.  And then he said something at the cool kids table and everybody went, shut up, dork.  He was still talking about it after the show was over. 
[03:26:30]  I'm like, no, it was fine.  It's just what we do.  Do you hate having to do that when people would do it?  Yeah, I have to act.  Oh, you did well.  I was a goof.  I was like, actually, it was a good story.  But, you know, we have to just fucking make, you know, stuff even more entertaining.  He goes, well, usually when I tell the story, I get a little edgier, but I wasn't sure if  I could.  Why?  Where does he get edgier than he tells that story?  I don't know, Sam.  I don't know.  I like when you have to do the, I'm making up.  It's okay.  It was all a goof thing because your voice gets high. 
[03:27:00]  It does, right?  You were great.  I took some acting classes.  I'm good at it.  I know.  The fact is, the story was horrendous.  It wasn't a good story.  It could be one of the worst ever.  Bob Kelly's just staring like, is this really happening?  Like, what comes next?  I don't know.  So what are we going to do?  I mean...  I got video to put up.  I got a video of Tiny just entering the studio, which was just fucking ominous.  Yeah.  His head was pretty much scraping the tiles.  And Mars...  The drop ceiling. 
[03:27:30]  Mars was thinking about that dick.  He has to bend when he walks down the hall because he's actually scraping the tiles with  his head.  You know when he stood up?  He actually...  He put his hand over his head because he hit that light on the ceiling.  And you know what's weird about Tiny?  A lot of guys that are just overly tall like that, they usually haunch and stuff.  He does it.  He is 7'8", true height.  I don't know if you...  He wasn't hunching?  He had a hunch, though.  What?  He did have a...  What?  You mean a sneaky suspicion?  Yeah.  He had a hunch? 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  He did.  I had a good joke I was going to say.  He's so tall, I want to go...  You ever have an airplane land on your ears or something?  Oh, that would have been horrible.  I wish he hadn't even brought that up just now.  Nothing says it's time to leave like a good fucking chip line.  That's his specialty.  The whole place would have cracked up.  No, nobody would have just...  How come they call you Tiny, you tall?  Hey, uh, does the guy believe I might have a charity?  Maybe.  I think so.  Why do you...  Because I never ask for 10 tickets.  What do you need...  I usually get a couple and I'm like... 
[03:28:30]  I know.  10 is like a whole section.  So buy them.  Like, why would you ask somebody for 10 tickets?  It's for my sister and one of the teachers of her kids.  And you can't just be a good...  I thought we were being a nice guy here.  You can't just go on the website and buy 10 tickets.  It's for a few.  I fucking do enough for my family.  If I could get 10 tickets and not have to write a check, you know what?  That's a good day for me.  But you had to lie to a guy and tell him to refer to charity.  It is for charity.  For his family.  Yeah.  Mars.  What? 
[03:29:00]  They're trying to buy a new scoreboard or something.  That's what I'll tell them.  They're a football program.  You keep going back.  It's not for a charity.  It's a charity, Sam.  Trust me.  It's just for 10 people that you know.  10 is too much to ask for.  I know.  It's way too...  You don't even like when people say, hey, can we drop by the studio and watch the show?  You're like, ah, no.  I don't want anybody on the couch today.  And you're...  Shut up, Sam.  And you're taking 10 tickets away from this guy.  I don't really feel like having anyone on the couch.  Yeah, but this guy, his sister just went through the... 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, but we're doing a show here.  I don't feel like having anybody on the couch.  I don't think I've ever asked for 10 of anything before.  No one's ever asked for 10 tickets.  They've never gotten that request.  No.  There's only one single...  There's only one digit room in the ticket request area.  Yeah.  So you can go up to 9 and then it gets ugly?  Yeah, no one's ever been...  How do we get enough to ask for 10?  I think it gets ugly after 2 when you're asking for free tickets.  When you ask for 4, it's like, okay, they're pushing it a little bit.  But then when you just get ridiculous and say, can I have 10 tickets?  I go, no, I want 10.  And then I was like, or they don't come on the show. 
[03:30:00]  So there might even be a Plagola thing happening.  Another Plagola fucking controversy I had to deal with.  What do you mean that you have to deal with?  You wouldn't have to deal with it if you didn't ask for 10 tickets.  I wanted 10.  I got 10.  Why don't you just get a couple?  Huh?  Or just have other people.  Like, say, Roland, I'm going to need a bunch.  So I'm going to ask for 4.  You ask for 2.  Jim ask for 2.  But you just said, yeah, there's a charity going on.  I need 10 tickets.  Hey, you know, what are you going to do?  It's the intern David slash acting voice. 
[03:30:30]  All right, we got to go.  Me and Jimmy.  What do you got going on?  A little Peter Pumpin?  Peter Pumpin?  Happy Valentine's Day.  It's a day of love.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  It's a day of love.  It is Valentine's Day.  We didn't even mention Valentine's Day once.  I'm going to get my dick sucked.  That's what you're doing for Valentine's Day?  I'm going to go down here and get my cock sucked.  That's Edgar.  I know who it is.  Oh, it's Edgar's brother.  You need to mind your manners.  Find the Lord?  Find the Lord, because you ain't got a God in your life. 
[03:31:00]  And he touches different, too.  Put your hand up.  That's how he touches.  I want to tell you something.  He touches with the tips of his fingernails.  Oh, it immediately gets creepy.  Let me show you how I touch.  Shut up.  Come here.  I hate him.  Put your hand here, boy.  It's not Edgar, though.  It's Edgar's brother.  What's Edgar's brother?  Yes.  What's Edgar's brother's name?  What's your name, sir?  Eugene.  That's right.  It's Eugene.  Move.  Get away, man.  He rarely comes out.  I don't like fucking...  Let him touch you, Bobby. 
[03:31:30]  No, you dry-toothed asshole.  Get away from me.  Put your arm out, boy.  I'm going to put...  Let me just touch your damn arm.  Go ahead.  I ain't going to hurt you.  No damn namby-pamby.  That's how you touch it like that.  No!  Come here.  Let me touch you.  Let me touch you.  What's worse?  What's worse?  John Jones choking you out, or Eugene touching your arm?  Yeah, it's Eugene fucking touching my arm.  It's just fucking...  It's still there.  Yeah.  You need to be touched. 
[03:32:00]  Fucking hate it.  Get the Lord your damn life.  Come here, boy.  You gotta let him do it, though.  It's kind of addicting.  It's like hot food.  It's like...  It's hot, and then you want it.  Ouch.  Oh, I gotta take another bite.  Yeah.  Bobby, is my podcast on today, or is that next week?  It's next week.  All right, good.  Next week, doing the podcast.  Returning to the...  You know what, dude?  Podcast.  Is this actually...  Why do I have headphones on?  We're on the air.  Is it really?  Yeah.  You think we're doing...  Oh.  You think this is... 
[03:32:30]  You think we're just giving this away?  That's true.  Why would we do that?  We don't socialize when the mics are off.  No.  I hope you would have been long gone.  Ollie, I'll get you that thing today.  Right when I get home.  I got some videos to put up.  Jimmy was suggesting put them all up in one video, but I don't think so.  I think Bobby's video is a standalone video today.  Because you're tapping like a motherfucker.  John Jones is choking the life out of you, and then you fall to the floor.  I can actually...  That video's going to do very well, Bobby.  My right cheekbone hurts, and I can smell metal and mint.  Oh, that's good.  You can smell metal and mint? 
[03:33:00]  You might want to call Dr. Steve, see what that's all about.  I got to go.  Kenny's waiting.  Yeah.  Promote all my shit.  Videos are up today.  You have a show.  What?  You have a show.  You have four hours to promote it.  When I do it, it sounds very needy.  As opposed to, hey, I'm out of here.  Promote my shit, boy.  Yeah, see, that doesn't sound needy.  Like, look, I could have done it, but I don't care that much.  And then you step up, and then you promote my shit.  I look like a fucking rock star and not like a needy asshole.  Can I promote my shit?  No, man. 
[03:33:30]  You're working for us right now.  This isn't one of your shows.  No, you're right.  Yeah, what is this?  What shit do you have?  I got all kinds of shit.  He's got a lot of shit.  Why'd you have to ask?  You really want to know?  It feels like he could say it now.  If it's a question to be answered, I'll answer the question.  You've got to answer the question, Sam.  I mean, are you talking about the website, notsam.com?  I don't know.  Promote my shit.  Promote his shit right now.  It's OB Radio on YouTube, and OB Radio on Twitter, and OB Radio fans on Facebook, and  OB Radio on probably Tumblr, and Whosay, and Instagram. 
[03:34:00]  He's not on Instagram.  He doesn't have an iPhone.  Is he still in that contest?  Who?  Opie.  Oh, you can vote for Opie for a Shorty and YouTube star?  Oh, Shorty Awards.  Oh.  But he doesn't want that, though.  I'm actually, you can vote for me in new podcasts on Shorty and podcasts.  I'm number eight on podcasts, and I'm number one on new comedy podcasts.  New comedy pod, you don't think that, that's not a real category. 
[03:34:30]  So?  So vote for Bob Kelly on pound new comedy podcasts.  I want a fucking Shorty Award so bad.  But they won't give it to you if it's...  I've never won anything, Sam.  That's a made-up category.  I don't care.  You just want to know that you won.  I've never won anything in my life, Sam.  I need this.  Made-up Shorty Award.  Well, yeah.  So, I mean, have we sufficiently promoted OB shit?  Yeah.  I feel like we have.  Yeah.  It's not shit, Sam. 
[03:35:00]  Hmm?  It's not shit.  Mars.  Are you growing horns?  I don't think so.  What are these on the side of your...  Are you losing weight?  Oh, here?  Maybe.  I don't even fuck with that.  I'll fight you for that.  Oh, Roland's got Bobby's...  Get the fuck out of here.  ...John Jones signed glove.  No.  By the way, I will say that...  He licked...  This is funny about Roland, though.  He licked the...  He's like a shitty magician.  He licked his index finger and then wiped his pinky on like he was wiping it.  But he didn't even, like, try to hide.  No. 
[03:35:30]  He's like...  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  That's what I'd love to say after I come in a girl.  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  Did you hear what nice guy Opie did?  What'd he do?  He told...  He wanted 10 tickets to see the Harlem Globetrotters.  So he told Roland to ask the guy for 10 tickets for a charity.  And he made up that any charity existed.  What was the charity?  He just needed...  The fund.  What is it?  The fund.  The fund?  That's the name of the...  Very clever.  Seinfeld.  You know what's the name of the...  It's a human fund on Seinfeld. 
[03:36:00]  Not just the fund.  But I can't do this human fund if I drop something off.  So you dropped off human.  I dropped human.  You know what's funny?  Real funny about the tickets for the Harlem Globetrotters.  To be honest.  They're inexpensive.  They are inexpensive?  Inexpensive.  How much are they?  Eight bucks.  Yeah, jeez.  Let's go to Ticketmaster.com and see.  Yeah, it's not expensive to go...  It's not like a U2 ticket.  So it's something that Opie probably could have afforded to buy 10 of.  Well, seeing as that he's a millionaire...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to say yes.  But the thing is...  This is why I have to side with Opie.  If you get those tickets through what you're doing, you'll get better treatment. 
[03:36:30]  If he went and bought the tickets, he's not going to get the...  I think they gave four tickets.  Will he get better treatment, though?  I don't know if they're like, this fucking asshole asked for 10 tickets.  Well, this guy, the one who told the story, is really nice.  Again, it's not Madonna.  It's fucking the Harlem Globetrotters.  They need the seats filled.  Yeah.  If anything...  They need certain pockets filled.  He's doing them a favor because they have that empty...  Well, I mean...  Well, you know, they do like...  What is it?  10 shows in the area?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you can't... 
[03:37:00]  You can't sell out 10 shows in the area.  They can't sell out every night.  In a week.  Unless if you're Bruce.  Unless you're Bruce.  Unless if you're Bruce.  Who's that?  Bruce Rickston.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Singer or something.  And I did tell Troy, if they're cutting liners, that Tiny needs to go in there and just  ask if anybody wants a peanut.  Because that guy sounds exactly like Andre the Giant.  He did.  I mean...  He really did.  Exactly.  Stop it.  I mean it.  Anybody want the peanut?  Yeah, he really did. 
[03:37:30]  I don't know.  He said he doesn't have any glandular problems or anything, but that voice is not a human  voice.  There's got to be something wrong.  It's a human...  What's wrong with you?  It's not a human voice.  It's human.  How come the only humans that sound like that are 7 foot 8 then?  He's a different type of human.  You're such an understanding guy.  He's a human.  It's not like he's a fucking...  A Yeti.  Well, you look like one of those aliens from Twilight Zone where they come down with the human cookbook.  Do they have British Sasquatches? 
[03:38:00]  Do they even buy into that shit?  I mean, they should because I saw one today.  I love that you're talking shit now.  If he was here, you would be saying that.  Well, because he's 7 foot whatever.  7 foot whatever?  7 foot 8.  7 foot 8.  Almost 8 feet tall.  Over 300 pounds.  Over 300 pounds.  It's very heavy.  What are you, announcing a wrestling match?  Over 300 pounds.  Um, were you, was it a dream come true with John Bones Jones today? 
[03:38:30]  Or were you a little, were you annoyed that he didn't release the hole when you tapped?  I didn't get annoyed.  I think the word would be scared.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oxygen being cut off.  I'll tell you, it, it, I don't care about the oxygen because you know, I know I'll, if  even if I passed out, I'd come back, I'd look like an asshole.  I really got scared because I heard bones cracking in my neck.  Not, not, not kidding.  And you sat there saying, holy shit, is this guy breaking my neck?  Because, listen, you don't realize, I've never been choked by somebody like that. 
[03:39:00]  I've never had a rear naked choke by a professional, uh, fighter.  By a championship fighter, by the way.  Yeah, he's a champ.  Almost undefeated.  And here's the deal.  You don't know, you don't, you can't add everything to the equation.  It's like when they're going to do like some stunt.  They forget that birds fly over a canyon too.  Yeah.  So the guy takes off and a bird flies into the, right into the spokes.  It's, it's that, it started cracking and I panicked.  So that's what made you tap when you heard the cracking? 
[03:39:30]  I heard, no, I panicked because I didn't expect cracking.  I just expected me choking.  So I was waiting to feel the choke, but then I heard crack.  Like, so my brain went somewhere else.  And I was like, I started talking to myself in my head.  Like, this bone's cracking.  I think he's breaking my neck.  Checking him, checking, like, can I feel my hands?  Am I paralyzed right now?  Well, then I remembered I had to tap out because he's actually choking me too.  So then I.  And that's when the, that's when that circle was getting smaller, like an old time movie  fade in.  Then I started tapping and then he wasn't letting go. 
[03:40:00]  And I tried to tap harder, but I didn't have it in me because the circle was getting.  So you really did.  You weren't playing it up when he released it and you kind of tumbled.  I, I was, yeah, it was, it was, I wasn't out at all.  I wasn't passed out.  I was on my way.  You were weak.  And I was panicked.  I panicked.  I panicked.  I was in like, I was in a state of shock because of the cracking and then the choking.  Well, he's like, he's the first guy to come in here and be like, nah, I'm going to put  it on a little harder.  I'll never do it again. 
[03:40:30]  No, let's put it that way.  I'll never for shits and giggles.  Let somebody almost kill me again because I'm surprised more UFC fighters aren't like  that.  Cause I would think they'd be like, oh yeah, it's for shits and giggles, right?  It's just for fun, right?  Well, watch this.  And then just leaves it on two seconds longer.  Just so you know, yeah, just in case you thought it was fun.  It's not fun.  It's not fun.  I don't know why Jimmy, I mean, I love that Jimmy does it because it's funny to see his  stressed all face every time when he gets choked up.  But I, I would never, after doing it like that time, I had it done with somebody  else.  I think Frank Shamrock, but he didn't really, but he was like a jovial, like, I'm just 
[03:41:00]  here for a good time.  Whereas John Jones was like, I'm here to have fun, but he's in the prime of his career.  I wouldn't, I actually wouldn't want to fuck with Frank Shamrock in the prime of his career.  He was actually more ruthless.  Than John Jones was?  Evil.  Yeah.  Evil.  He broke people's arms.  Fucking evil.  And laugh.  Yeah.  He was, he, he was, he was laughing in Boss Rootin's face to get him to punch him in 
[03:41:30]  the face.  Cause he was doing pancreas and in pancreas, you can't close hand fist punch somebody.  You can only palm punch somebody.  So he was trying to get, he was in a leg lock and he was just looking at him, saying shit  to him to get him so angry that he would punch him.  And he did.  And when by DQ?  You refer to Frank Mir?  No, I'm Frank Shamrock.  Yeah, Shamrock was the one that did that.  Frank Shamrock.  Don't ever correct me.  That's the second time you've made a mistake correcting people.  This is what he did.  The first time was what?  John Bones.  You corrected me.  Rashad is 5'10", 5'11". 
[03:42:00]  He corrected me.  You said a hundred times, Frank Shamrock.  We're talking about Frank Shamrock.  Fucking, uh, Bobby, did you say Frank Mir?  No.  That's what happens if you don't pay attention to that.  No, but then he went, then he said, because that happened with Frank Shamrock.  I said that.  Don't say it like you're making the fucking statement.  I just want you to know, Bobby.  My bad.  Marge is all excited because it's UFC day.  When did an improv group start doing the Run and Fez show?  He is, you know who this is?  No, I don't.  His name's UCB Fred.  Is it really? 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  That's true.  You're a UCB guy, right?  You do improv?  He actually does.  I fucking am awesome.  You're the man.  I used to do improv too, my friend, Fred.  You want to do a little scene or something?  Let's do hands right now.  Can you do hands?  Hands?  Hands with Bobby.  Go over with Bobby.  You don't know hands improv?  No.  Oh, boy.  What are they teaching these kids?  This is what you do.  Ready?  All right, so come here.  Get behind me.  Oh, I love this game.  You can put your arms underneath my arms and just bend down a little bit.  Now you're on my arms.  Now you talk to me.  Hey, Bob. 
[03:43:00]  How are you doing?  Hey, what's going on, man?  I'm pretty good.  Look over there.  That's just silly.  Hey, what's happening?  What's your favorite, like, who's the best hitter in the UFC?  Who punches the best?  First, you have, well, number one, I would say.  Well, list them.  List them.  Okay, first.  We got one.  Yeah.  Well, what do they look like?  This is the worst radio ever.  What do they look like when they're fighting?  Well, you got Jones, who has a nice right hand.  Yeah.  How does that go, though?  That's a right hand over there.  He picks it up and he punches it.  Boom.  Come on.  Punch.  One, two, three.  It looks like he's just picking things up.  And he throws the left hook. 
[03:43:30]  Wicked!  Yeah.  Wicked!  Wicked!  Dude, you have the videotape.  Are your nipples itching?  This is the worst radio ever.  It's UCB Fred sticking his arms and using his arms for Bobby.  He's actually really good.  Well, he's like a purple belt improver.  Really?  Yeah.  That's great.  I love improv.  You do?  It's one letter short of improve.  That's your joke.  Do you have, Eric, the sound of Jim being choked?  I want to play it again.  Yep.  One second.  I love it. 
[03:44:00]  I love Eric, too.  I fucking love Eric.  Why do you love Eric?  Oh.  You don't hook that up.  Who?  You could have been there for the interview, but you were out of town.  I wasn't out of town.  They canceled the last minute, so I was in town.  Why didn't you come by?  I had to turn in my book yesterday, so we had to do last minute edits.  Oh, the cheap book?  It's coming out in August.  They call it the pub.  That's very exciting.  Pub.  I mean, I don't know why we're plugging seven months away, but.  It's pub.  You can get it.  Pub. 
[03:44:30]  What did Jim sound like?  Here we go.  It sounds like something that should come out of your asshole.  I was just about to say, we should play fart or choke with Norton.  We should isolate all of Norton's choking sounds, and then all of his farts that we already  have isolated, and play fart or choke.  Or mouth or asshole is the name of the game.  Norton is the fucking best for actually allowing this to happen.  Not allowing it.  Like, he would be disappointed if it didn't happen.  Yeah.  And every time he gets out of the hole, he's got these wide eyes, and he always goes, wow! 
[03:45:00]  Like, he didn't expect this one to be bad.  I guarantee.  I guarantee this is turning into a fetish.  I guarantee.  Yeah.  He's typing in Craigslist, UFC fighter body.  Today, he wasn't satisfied with the choke.  He was like, yeah, hit me.  Oh, I want to maybe get another hit.  Maybe get, like, he kept...  Yeah, was he the Joker in Batman?  Hit me!  Hit me!  You want the punch, too? 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, give me...  All right.  All right, a punch from Jon Jones to Jim Norton.  Oh, shit!  That's fucking thud.  That was a thud.  That's a thud.  That's right on bone.  That's bone.  He's going to be hurting later.  But he's going to like it.  He's going to be hurting, but it's going to be like, that's hurt that Jon Bones Jones gave me.  I like this.  I bet he orders a fucking punching machine.  You start jerking off, getting choked and punched.  Yeah, just getting punched and beat off.  Would you do that?  Would I get punched?  If somebody you knew was like, dude, I just want to jerk off, and you choke me. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, Jesus.  But I want you to just choke me out.  Who?  Say it was Norton.  Say Norton was like, look, dude, I'm going to give you $500.  Just choke me.  $500?  $500.  You don't have to watch me.  You can look the other way.  Just choke me while I jerk off.  Am I choking him from behind?  You're behind him, yeah.  Like a rear naked choke.  Yeah, but you're fully clothed.  Of course.  And he's sitting in a chair?  No, he's standing up.  Nude.  Over a toilet bowl. 
[03:46:30]  No, he's just got his pants down, so his cock's coming out.  Not his asshole?  Nope.  Nope.  Oh.  And where are we?  Are we at his...  You're in his house, and...  We're not on the road.  Not on the road.  You don't have to travel with him.  You're just in the bathroom.  You come over.  What's up?  Wait, wait, wait.  Do I have to make a special trip for this, or am I already there?  No, he pays for your travel.  Oh.  So he pays for your travel.  Mm-hmm.  And then $500 cash.  You come in.  You choke him.  But you can't let him die.  And he's...  It's called fiction music. 
[03:47:00]  And he might...  And you can't let him pat...  You can't let him fall to the ground.  I would...  $750.  $750?  $750.  So for $750, what's the $50 for?  Because you can...  You fucking homo.  It's an extra 50%.  I don't want to get greedy.  $750, I would do it.  Tax-free.  Cash.  Yeah, cash.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'd do it for $750.  Really?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Why not?  $750, you'd choke a guy and let him jerk off?  Norton.  He's the boss.  Because he's your friend. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's like, I wouldn't do it, like, for Eric.  It would cost 5 Gs.  5 Gs?  I would do it to Eric for 5 Gs.  5 Gs?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really?  What about me?  For you?  Yeah.  I would do it for $1,200.  Why am I more expensive than Norton?  Because there is sort of, like, this element that it could get sexual with you.  I'm just gonna...  I'm gonna, like, turn around.  Like those creepy guys with kids, they go to kiss the cheek and they turn.  Right.  And they kiss him on the lips.  Exactly.  Like, Norton, I can guarantee, is just... 
[03:48:00]  Only wants to be choked.  Whereas you, all of a sudden, you start pushing back a little bit.  And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Not for $750.  Norton's a professional, is what you say.  Exactly.  Like, Norton doesn't have...  He just wants to get choked and he knows I'll choke him.  Right.  And everything's cool, whereas you might start pushing back or arching a little differently.  Arching your back so that the butt sticks out and the ass up in the air.  Arch my back so you can rest a beer bottle on my ass.  Exactly.  It could get very weird very quick, so I don't... 
[03:48:30]  Are you married?  Not yet.  This summer.  And you've only...  How many girls have you had?  Five.  In your life?  In my life.  That's it.  Wow.  Just five.  That is fucking so interesting to me.  Yeah.  Just...  And how many girls have you had sex with?  All five?  That's what I meant.  So you've had sex with five girls in your life.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  So you can probably count how many times you've had sex.  I mean, I don't know.  I've been...  I exclude the girl you're with now.  No, because I was in a long-term relationship before her, too.  But, I mean, you know...  What's the weirdest thing you've ever done with a girl? 
[03:49:00]  Um...  Wow.  That's forget.  Yeah.  I've never done anything...  Nothing weird.  You've never put any vegetables in a girl?  No.  I've never...  I've never done anything...  You've never fucking got on all fours?  No.  Had a girl fucking come up from behind?  You've never had a...  Did it eat your ass?  No.  You've never had your butt licked?  No.  We talked about this before on this show.  Wow.  Never.  No.  I mean, I'm not saying it won't happen.  You don't know what the future holds.  You're not going to let your wife do that.  That's not...  What are you like? 
[03:49:30]  Like, is it good fellas?  Like...  The older you get, the days of that happening are slimmed down.  I'm not going to let the mother of my children do that.  She kisses my son with that mouth.  I would never...  I would never...  My ass is retired.  You won't do it ever again.  My ass was in its prime to get eaten and licked around in the late 20s.  That's back when you were handsome, Bob, though.  No, I was fat.  I know that too.  Oh, okay.  But in late 20s, early 30s, I had a great... 
[03:50:00]  Those were my prime you-can-eat-my-ass days.  What made it so...  I could get on all fours, stand up in a cemetery and have a girl just get on her knees.  It just happened to be clean in that period of time?  It was just a nice asshole.  Yeah.  Like, nice and clean and young and fresh.  And then the older you get, it's just, you know, it's just...  It starts getting swampy and...  I wouldn't...  You know, it's just like, ah, I feel...  I would feel bad.  Yeah.  I'd feel like, ah...  I mean, I still like it, but I feel bad. 
[03:50:30]  Well, was it weird for you to transition into getting married after you had all of your  experiences?  Because obviously you are the complete opposite.  Getting married, the hardest part of that is letting go of what might be.  In fact...  Yeah.  Yeah, because you...  Because especially in this business, when you're doing entertainment, you get to meet  chicks all the time, and you get all really cool, interesting, hot chicks coming up to  you and going, hey, I'm a big fan, and you're like, fuck, I'm a big fan of you, physically. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  That's all it is, too.  Well, it's not.  I mean, you know, their fucking vibe is cool.  I mean, there's a lot of cool, different chicks that you meet.  You're like, well, I'd love to spend some time with this broad, but you can't.  And letting go of that, and just being...  Because you don't want to get to the end of your life and go, I fucked up.  Yeah.  I fucked up.  Right.  And so you have to figure out what's more valuable, if you're going to regret not going for this  girl, or if you're going to regret the fact that you had a good relationship that you  completely fucked up.  Are you going to...  Here's a fact. 
[03:51:30]  Do you want somebody around to wipe your ass when you can't, and take care of you, and  be with somebody?  It would be pleasant.  And not be alone?  Yeah.  Or do you want to roll the dice, and go and get your ass eaten in the fucking Hojo's  parking lot?  Yeah.  I mean, the Hojo's...  In your 50s.  You know what I mean?  The Hojo's option is very short-term thinking.  Right.  Well, here's the thing, is that, you know, it's also, you know, being with one girl, there's 
[03:52:00]  something to it.  There's something challenging to that, too.  You know, being with one girl.  But, like, you're a guy, you only been with five girls.  I've been with, you know, a lot of fucking broads.  How many do you think?  How many?  Honestly?  Yeah.  And I'm saying this, now, not fucking, but sexual, like, kissing, handjobs, whatever.  But it has to be over... between 300 and 400.  Wow.  A lot more than five.  Well, because I did it as an addiction for years. 
[03:52:30]  Okay.  I was banging when I was young, okay?  So you've got to take all those drinking years in when I was banging chicks.  And then when I got sober, I just, you know, I started to go to meetings and banging.  You know what I mean?  Do you pick up girls in meetings?  Yeah, because there's nothing else to do.  You're not drinking.  You're not using drugs.  You go to a meeting and there's some chick that's fucking shaking, but she loves to suck  cock.  You're trying to help her.  Okay.  You're trying to hear, I want a drink.  Well, put this in your mouth.  Drink this.  God grit me the serenity, doing some things I cannot change.  The courage changes again, and the wisdom knows the difference. 
[03:53:00]  So it's, yeah, it's, you know, and then you, you know, and then, you know what it is, though?  This is, you meet people who got divorced.  It fascinates me because it's like, you had to be at the point where you're like, this is  the one.  You got married.  That's what scares me.  But then you got Ant, who said that the night he got married, that night, he was laying  in his hotel bed, crying. 
[03:53:30]  Like, what the fuck did I just do?  This was a huge mistake.  He did, but that's because he was on the show.  He was crying about the, what did I do?  Why am I here?  No.  He, yeah, I mean, he, that's why I always ask people who got divorced.  Did you love her at one point?  Yeah, at one point where you're like, this is going to last forever.  A lot of guys go, no, I knew it was the wrong move.  They just did it for some reason.  But some guys, you know, you got married because you thought it was the right thing.  That's what scares me. 
[03:54:00]  So you kind of, if you know that, look, this is the girl for me.  Yeah.  This is it.  I'm done.  I think you're okay.  Yeah.  But if you don't fucking know.  Yes, absolutely.  If you don't fucking know that this is, you're an idiot.  Yeah, if you're not sure, if there's, if there's like, I think so, but I'm not sure.  She's not.  It's not.  If you're not going to fucking bust your fucking, your child's salad in her and have a baby.  Right.  And, and, and sacrifice everything for a family with that. 
[03:54:30]  Don't get married.  Yeah.  Just go get fucking laid.  Yeah.  Find somebody else.  Cause there might be somebody else.  Cause you never, you never got to use your fame for sex.  No.  You like, cause you, I mean, you have some type of fame.  People know you.  No.  And that's like, I was going to ask you, like when you're meeting these girls, do you have  to cut yourself off at a certain point in a conversation?  I have to go back to my hotel room.  Yeah.  Yeah.  After the shows, I'll do a little meet and greet and I'm gone.  I have to go back to the hotel room and kind of shut it down. 
[03:55:00]  Because the minute you start on a social level, I can't go to like, thank God.  Remember instant messaging?  Yeah.  That was the worst.  Twitter is the new instant messaging kind of, but instant messaging was the worst.  Cause you turn that thing on and it's all of a sudden, Hey, you're like, Hey, and you're  like, I was at your show.  Remember talking about, yeah.  Do you have a cam?  I do.  Cause every question you're like, well, I can respond to this one without getting in  trouble.  I'll be okay now.  And then all of a sudden you're in way too deep. 
[03:55:30]  Oh, it's, it's always like, Hey, how you doing?  Good.  How are you?  Great show.  Thanks.  Big.  I've been a big, huge fan of yours ever since I, Oh, thank you.  Are you alone?  Yes.  Yeah.  I mean, it's okay to be alone.  Yeah.  Um, are you staying, what hotel are you staying in?  She's just curious.  Holiday Inn.  Oh, that's right near my house.  Oh, that's fucking nice.  Nice neighborhood.  Yeah.  You want company just to talk. 
[03:56:00]  And then all of a sudden, bing, you have a photo.  It's just her with her fucking licking her tit.  Sucking.  You're like, fucking yes.  Come over.  You're past the point of no returning.  It's just terrible.  But yeah, I, I, I, I can't really.  Good for you, dude, because you got a good girl.  Exactly.  She's fucking great.  I, I, and I'm not just saying that cause we're on the air.  I'm not winking at you right now going fucking rage.  Yeah.  You girls cool.  And she's hot.  Way out of your league. 
[03:56:30]  Way out of my league.  And way, way.  I mean, like, like if I was in, I'd be high school baseball and she would be way, she'd be a world series champion.  You should be with a redhead with a fuck up tooth.  You see, this is what I have to deal with.  You see, look at this.  Nicole from the morning mashup is standing outside my window with a Sam Roberts t-shirt on.  You see, this is what I have to deal with.  Do you understand that girl right there?  She, look at this.  Look at her though.  She's smoking.  She's a temptress.  Yeah, she's a temptress.  But I, I, I'm past it.  Here's the thing. 
[03:57:00]  Here's the thing.  You hook up with her, you're in trouble.  Right.  You're in trouble.  You're never going home after that.  Right.  Yeah.  You've tasted the fucking, the, the dirty wine.  But that's why I'm not going to.  She can wear my not Sam shirts all day long.  Yeah.  You know, and she, and she'd get sick of you in a second.  Why?  Because once, once the, your fucking Sam shit wore off, you're not Sam, cutie, fucking  patootie horse.  Once she realized it wasn't charm, it was like, this is, I'm actually an idiot.  See, see, you're, you're, you have this character you do, this sarcastic fucking dildo. 
[03:57:30]  Douchebag.  Funny douchebag.  Yeah, douchebag, whoever said that.  The guy with the Puerto Rican accent who can't speak Spanish.  Go on.  You have this character you do, but once you become Sam, like frustrated, like regular Sam,  I'm like fucking traffic or, you know, she'd be like, you just, you just, you're just  human.  I had a rough one at work today.  And but, uh, you're human.  What?  How many girls I've had, like hot shakes who found out that I'm just human.  You're just a guy.  You're not just, you're not funny.  Like they're just like, you're going through one of your stories and they're just waiting 
[03:58:00]  for the punchline.  Like, yeah.  Here it is.  Ready?  This is the next day when you're eating breakfast and you're just not, you're just a human  and like, you were funnier last night.  And you're like, oh, that, this was a huge mistake.  Or when you're trying to be funny, they go, yeah, that was funny when I first met you.  Knock it off.  And you're like, oh boy.  But you're like, I met Jess.  Yeah.  Like I, the same, I started dating her the same time I started to intern.  Yeah, she met you when you were a hunk of garbage.  Right.  That's when you meet a chick.  When you're a nobody.  That's right.  That's when she knows you're just nothing. 
[03:58:30]  Right.  And she liked you for just your fucking dumbness.  And now that I'm slightly above nothing, like very slightly above nothing.  Well, well, I mean, I, yeah, my, my chick met me when I was a waiter.  Right.  And I did comedy for shits and giggles.  And I used to go.  It was a punchline.  What was the joke?  That did, dude.  I used to make noise.  That was it.  I used to go.  Fucking dude.  This guy's a fucking idiot. 
[03:59:00]  Silly Bobby's on stage.  I get, I dude, I'm not kidding.  I get douche shivers just remembering what I used to be like on stage.  Dude, fucking.  And I still did good.  I don't know what the fuck these dummies were laughing at.  That's why I love this show.  Cause like ONA bring in their tapes from when they were first starting and Jim brings in  his standup and I'm sitting there going, all right, if I just stay with this, people  get good.  Here's the deal.  I brought in my tape once and we watched only a couple minutes.  I remember that.  Only a couple minutes. 
[03:59:30]  And then we had to go.  And that was at the XM studios.  And we've never, I don't know why I'm whispering.  You don't tell anyone.  We never went back to it.  We never went back to my tape.  And you got a stay of execution and they forgot you were in on death row.  Totally forgot.  They got this.  Oh, here comes Danny running down the hall.  He's not going to let this stand.  If we need a Bobby tapes, I know that we, we do have his burly bear audition tapes in 
[04:00:00]  the system somewhere.  Okay.  The burly bear audition tapes are terrible, but the fucking tape I gave you, I gave it  to you.  Wow.  I don't even remember that.  At the XM studio, it's me in a, in a green flannel that I cut the sleeves off of, right?  With hair.  I mean, fucking amazing hair.  Yeah.  Curly, new kids in the block, faded, awesome hair.  On stage at a Chinese restaurant, killing with garbage. 
[04:00:30]  And I, and at the end of jokes, I'm going, I wish I could remember this tape.  I don't remember.  I'm like, this chick had a fucking fat ass, like a parachute.  I remember putting it in the, cause you gave us the VHS tape and I remember transferring  it.  Yeah.  It's, we have to have it digitally somewhere.  It's gone, dude.  I have it at my house.  Never.  Are you going to bring it back?  I don't need you guys anymore.  I don't need you.  Yeah.  You got your own show now.  You have your own podcast.  I don't need this bullshit.  I don't need to.  I got the, you know what, dude?  Yeah. 
[04:01:00]  I got millions and millions of fans.  Okay.  Thousands and thousands.  Okay.  Hundreds.  Dozens of fans.  We'll say.  I, I, yeah, dude, that fucking tape was the worst, Danny.  I wish I remember it.  I don't know.  I remember it.  This is why I remember it.  Cause Norton told the fucking ONA listeners, cause I was plugging a gig at bananas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, not for nothing.  When Bob comes on stage, that's what he likes.  So they, and now they go Robert Kelly and all just.  It sounded like a fucking Turkey farm. 
[04:01:30]  Where are you going to be next?  Las Vegas.  You said, I'm in, Oh, I'm at Vegas.  This is weird, man.  I usually do the palms in Vegas, which is a, you know, the hip hotel.  You're kind of young.  I'm doing the Paris.  The Paris.  They have a comedy club at the Paris now.  And, uh, I'm somebody just said in a green flannel, you must've looked like Dick Foley.  Ah, I gotcha.  You got it, right?  Yeah.  We got it from Mick Foley.  Go on.  I got it.  What was Jay in Huntington that you didn't laugh at?  Not me. 
[04:02:00]  Well, it's, I'm not laughing.  I was just, it was, it was all right.  Okay.  Go on.  He just, he got excited because he rhymed Dick and Nick.  I mean, I don't really get fucking excited over rhyming.  You don't like it.  If you spell it up with one of those.  If he, if that was at the end of it, you're Dick Foley.  Hilarious.  So punch it up for these people.  You're right.  Don't worry about it.  I don't think you're going to be getting any Twitter, uh, mentions later with Scala.  I'll roll out phonetically.  Figure out how to spell it and leave it on Bob Kelly's Twitter.  I'm going to go ahead and say, uh, S-K-O, uh, Scala. 
[04:02:30]  S-K-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A.  I think it's an O in there.  I think it's an S-C-H.  Okay.  Yeah.  Scala.  So you're going to be at the Paris.  We're going to be at the Paris, uh, not this weekend, next weekend.  Uh-huh.  Um, I'm going to be at the Paris.  It's fucking.  So all you Las Vegas fans, get out there and scala-lub all the way home.  I can't wait.  I'm playing the Paris, though.  I've never, I, I've, uh, the Paris Hotel I've never been to. 
[04:03:00]  Really?  I walked to the front and saw the stupid fucking dumb thing they have up front, but I've never  been to the, and I, and being at that part of the strip is kind of actually cool.  I'm usually way, I'm at the Hard Rock, which is off the strip, or the Palms, which is way  out of the fucking way.  Uh-huh.  I haven't been on the strip doing comedy in 12 years.  This is exciting.  Well, yeah, dude, because you're right fucking there.  You're in the middle of the action.  You're in the action, man.  You're right there, dude. 
[04:03:30]  You get to look at the fucking, the fountains at the Bellagio, the fucking fire show over  at the Mirage, the fucking pirate show at the goddamn Thunderbolt.  What is it?  Thunderbolt.  I don't know.  Thunder!  What is it called?  They cut back on all those, those fire shows, though.  Um, no.  Because I heard, like, gas prices are insane, and they were just using so much fuel that  they actually, they used to do it, like, every 20 minutes, now it's, like, once every couple  hours or something.  I watched, I watched this, it was so sad, I watched this, uh, it was a documentary, because  that's all I love doing on Netflix now.  Oh, yeah. 
[04:04:00]  Watching shitty documentaries.  Um, and I watched this thing on this, it's called Naked Vegas, and it's this guy who did  Naked New York, Naked Los Angeles.  He just took, uh, photos of naked people.  With their clothes on, with their clothes on, and then them naked, side by side.  And it's actually a really interesting book, because you see these people in one photo,  clothes on, what they look like, and then naked, and just the, just 99% of us are just  fucking gross.  I will...  We're fucking gross.  There's...  Speak for yourself, Bobby.  Dude, we're just disgusting.  Yeah.  I would watch, I'll watch anything that has a bunch of pictures of naked people in it. 
[04:04:30]  Like, any documentary about that, like, you say it's interesting.  Yeah, it's just interesting to see naked people.  But you just want to look at naked people, and they're gross, it's not like you're jerking  off and watching it.  It's just, all the stomachs, and fucking scars, and just weird dicks.  So many weird dicks.  Tiny ones?  You think a dick is a dick, but it's just not...  Oh, this one guy was, he had a really important job, I forget what it was, I forget, he was like,  you know, like a businessman, tats all over his body. 
[04:05:00]  Under his, like he wore suits?  Fat guy, yeah, suits, fat, and this tiny little, but he didn't trim his bush fat, so it's just  this big patch of hair, and this little tiny...  Button cock?  Little, yeah, like a mushroom growing, this little pud in the middle, and he didn't have  a problem with it, like he, it's like...  He was proud of his body.  I think the last thing I would do is fucking want to be in a book naked.  No way. 
[04:05:30]  The worst one I saw that was similar to that, I won't mention any names to protect the innocent  out there, but like blow up a balloon, a small balloon, to about a softball size, and then  you know where you tie it off?  Yeah.  Take your finger and just poke that inward, until you indent the balloon.  Yeah.  I saw someone's penis and balls look like that.  How'd you see that?  It happened.  It was...  What?  It was around.  You have experiences too.  No, well, it was O&A related.  Who was it?  Was it Eric?  No.  Eric, you got a tiny little cock?  What?  No.  No, it was not. 
[04:06:00]  Like I said, I'm not...  Who?  Bobo?  No.  Bobo's dick was bigger.  Really?  Eric's...  Yeah.  Eric is all nutsack.  Like, Eric's got a lot of...  First impression, yeah.  I got a big sack, though.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Eric's been stripped down to his boxer briefs.  I love my big sack.  You do?  My sack is so big sometimes when I sit to pee in the morning, when I usually wake up, have  a...  I have my coffee and I gotta go take a shit.  And then if I have to pee, sometimes I pee on my own...  My balls. 
[04:06:30]  I'm not kidding.  I've peed in my balls.  Like, it just...  Do you like it?  No, I do.  Is it like a fun thing?  Like, look how big my ball bag is.  I can pee in it.  I just piss in my sack.  But on purpose.  Yeah, like...  Not on purpose.  It's just my balls are just hot and big.  Yeah.  I have a big...  And my dick isn't as big.  Right.  I have an okay...  I have a grower, not a shower.  But sometimes it's all tucked away.  Sometimes.  But my balls are never... 
[04:07:00]  And then you piss all over your balls.  My balls are never not big.  Wow.  Like, I have a nice big sack.  It's like the comedy track on Bobby Kelly's album from a few years ago, Big Dick Day.  Sometimes I have Big Dick Day.  Big Dick Day.  Sometimes.  I haven't had Big Dick Day in a while, though, because of the weight.  Robert Kelly on iTunes.  Oh, because...  Is Dr. Steve right?  Does the dick grow when the weight goes down?  Yeah, you gain like half an inch every few pounds or something like that.  Every three pounds, you gain like half an inch.  No, my...  That's incredible.  I lost 30 pounds.  I actually... 
[04:07:30]  I'm packing 14 now.  Wow.  My...  Your dick gets big.  Your bush fat.  What happens is your bush fat...  Yeah.  It recedes, right?  Your bush fat recedes.  The pubis.  Yeah, your pubis fat, right?  It recedes, so you gain like an inch of...  Oh, I got you.  Right.  And blood can get down there better because you're not as...  So you can grow a little bit better.  Yeah, you get a little...  My dick definitely gets bigger when I'm thin, yeah.  It's like, I have a nice piece when I'm in shape.  Real quick.  I'm a fucking nice piece.  I got to take some calls.  We got UFC video games, right? 
[04:08:00]  Don't we have three UFC games?  I thought we...  Didn't we give them away already?  I'm going to give away this signed John Jones glove.  It says to Bob.  I'm not you?  I'm kidding.  You can't give this to anybody who calls here.  Ask Sal.  Hang on, I'm checking.  We gave two away already.  So we got three left?  All right, let me check.  Yeah, we have three.  Sal just told me.  I'll go to Sal for my information from now on.  Eric, thank you very much.  Wow.  Good.  Dan.  I'll go home early.  I'm so glad we only had five to give away.  Could you imagine if it was any more?  The record keeping that takes place over there. 
[04:08:30]  By the way, that bit Bobby was talking about with the old VHS tape.  I got to talk to Dan.  Dan, we got a minute left.  Go ahead.  What?  He has it in the system.  You don't have it.  It's not the bit bit.  It doesn't have the skull loop thing, but we don't have time to play it anyway.  Ah, you're really panicking.  You don't know how to run a show, do you?  I get cut off.  Okay, go ahead.  Dan.  You should.  What's up, dude?  What's up, dude?  Hello.  Hey.  What's up, dude?  How you doing, guys?  I heard your fiance left you.  I don't have one.  Yeah, she peaced out on Sunday. 
[04:09:00]  Why?  Uh, well, we've been going back and forth, a lot of little bullshit, but I told her I  quit smoking the, uh, reefer.  Um.  She dumped you?  A month back.  Yeah.  She fucking found, listen, the tiniest little bag.  I haven't smoked in forever.  She goes away for a week, finds a bag in the laundry, of all places, like I'm a fucking  16-year-old in high school.  Speed it up, dude.  Show's almost over.  You're fucking talking like you're smoking weed now. 
[04:09:30]  Listen, your fiance left you, Dan, your fiance, she did the right thing.  Yeah, she did you a favor, buddy.  The relationship wasn't going to work out.  You're not a good fiance.  Yeah, you should be dating a chick with pink hair and tattoos.  Yeah.  Who doesn't give a fuck if you got a dime bag in your fucking jeans?  It wasn't going to work out.  Do you want a video game?  Yeah, man.  That'd be awesome.  Do you have Xbox or PlayStation?  It doesn't matter.  He's going to flip it for weed on eBay anyway.  Xbox?  Oh, no.  Xbox.  You do the same stuff to them.  I'm going to put you on hold.  I don't want to hear it.  Dan just won. 
[04:10:00]  UFC 3 undisputed for Xbox.  I gotta go.  I don't like being here to the end of the show.  With it, this is it.  I'm out.  You just did.  RobertKilleyLive.com.  Go to RiotCast.com.  You know what, dude?  Podcast.  I like the way you say it with the inflection.  You know what, dude?  Podcast.  Thank you.  I don't like being here.  I never stayed to the end of the show.  Well, you're not going to get out that door before I end it.  It's bad luck.  You're not getting out of there.  If you do that, the show will be canceled.  Okay, get out of it.  Bobby's stuck.  Rod and Fez are coming up next as Bob Mouse, Danny. 
[04:10:30]  He really does have big balls.  Stay tuned.  Put your hooks in.  Rod and Fez are coming up next.  And we'll be back with more of this tomorrow.
