<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with technical difficulties swiftly resolved by Mars.  The hosts then launched into a discussion of "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" and the relaunch of their "WOW" sticker promotion, encouraging listeners to send a SASE for a sticker in hopes of receiving "tit flashes" from women.  They transitioned to a cynical critique of New York City Mayor's plan to close Times Square to car traffic, replacing it with a bike lane and yoga classes, questioning its practicality and lack of public input.  This segued into a discussion of New York State tax increases.

A large portion of the show recapped the previous day's interview with Jesse Ventura, focusing on his absurd 9/11 conspiracy theories, specifically his claim that exploding paint brought down the World Trade Center towers.  They also highlighted the technical difficulties that prematurely ended the interview and showed a video clip of their hasty exit afterward.

The hosts then discussed Duff McKagan's upcoming appearance, referencing a blog post calling them "douchebags."  This prompted a call from "Dan the Trucker," complaining about SiriusXM's preferential promotion of Howard Stern's show despite Stern's criticisms of Opie and Anthony and claims that they lacked listeners. This fueled a debate about SiriusXM's promotional practices.

A correction on the swine flu death toll was followed by a discussion of gout, spurred by a victim having the ailment.  A caller provided a medical explanation, prompting humorous reactions to images of gout-affected joints. Jimmy then presented unusual gifts from his parents – a luggage locator and an LL Bean weather station – before a chaotic and confusing "Godfather" trivia game ensued, culminating in a sandwich mishap.  The segment ended with jokes about Kenny's physique.

The next segment began with another confusing "Godfather" trivia game with an unnamed participant, "Dan."  Jesse Ventura joined, continuing his 9/11 conspiracy theories. The broadcast was abruptly cut off by computer failure, but the backstage conversation with Ona and Sam Roberts continued,  featuring Ventura’s further elaborations on his theories and allegations against the government.  Dr. Michio Kaku’s contrasting explanation of the World Trade Center collapse was referenced.

Comedian Rich Vos was a studio guest.  He shared an almost fatal incident involving his child and the oven, transitioning to a frank discussion of his marital problems with Bonnie, including details of their sex life and communication issues. A caller shared similar marital woes.  The segment took a bizarre turn when Vos inadvertently revealed his Twitter password ("comic630") on-air, leading to "Mo Step" from Kentucky taking control of his account.  The hosts and Vos reacted to the takeover with disbelief and amusement as Mo altered his profile and interacted on-air.

The fallout from Vos's password disclosure continued, with the hosts and producer Travis examining his MySpace and Facebook pages, mocking his "sexy" photos.  They discussed his Twitter activity, including his following of Britney Spears and his use of a Jimmy Norton underwear photo as his profile picture.  Listeners hacked his accounts, with one purchasing 400 hotel tickets using his Priceline account.  The hosts reviewed a listener-created website, "Oapedia," documenting Vos's mispronunciations ("Voscabulary").  A call to Bonnie revealed her amusement and exasperation.  Kenny filled in with a country music demo during Vos's off-air calls, and Dice was briefly interviewed.  The segment was filled with vulgar language and sexually suggestive humor.

The final segment centered on the success of Dice's children's band, L.A. Rocks.  Their music, played on the show, gained popularity, leading to MySpace messages and attention from a record company after Duff McKagan heard them.  Several songs, including "Outlaw" and "Junkyard," were played.  The hosts discussed securing a New York City concert for L.A. Rocks in early August.  The conversation included discussions of Dice's relationship with Bonnie, his parenting style, and other personal matters.  Bonnie and her baby were present in the studio, leading to raunchy exchanges.  The segment concluded with a call to action for bass players to join L.A. Rocks via their MySpace page, maintaining the show's raunchy and vulgar tone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Good morning, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  On this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Oh, that's right, and weather's supposed to be a little nicer.  Yeah, we gotta figure out what to do with this Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yeah, it kind of took a...  Well, I'm so distracted at my not-like-it-sounded-yesterday headphones.  I noticed that, too.  There's a very...  Mars, what's up? 
[00:00:30]  There's a tinny thing going on.  Is it a setting, maybe?  Maybe a setting?  Is it a setting?  If that's it, I'm in, because I was gonna try to ignore it, but I really can't.  It's tinnier than it was yesterday.  Is it something over here?  Tinnier.  There's something at that...  Oh!  That's the mother of a...  Yes!  That's the guy.  Now I'm digging it.  One button gets pushed.  I am Mars. 
[00:01:00]  Mars, what's your status?  Are you continuing with us, or what?  What are they told you?  Still waiting until next week.  Yeah, great.  I know what's gonna happen.  We're gonna be the last survivors of XM.  Is that it?  No offense, Mars.  Like, uh...  I am legend?  Yeah.  I don't even acknowledge that there are XM employees that could do really, really well  for the new company, Sirius XM.  No, no.  Mars, I hope you continue.  I just want to make that public. 
[00:01:30]  Mars is one of the good guys.  Ah, continued success.  Continued success.  Mars takes care of all the technical things for the studio and the show.  And it was a little tinny.  He came over.  He pushed the button.  See?  Who else is gonna do that, Mars?  Come on!  That would have been, uh, like an hour of some other guy running around, trying to figure  it out.  Do we still hand out WOW stickers?  What stickers?  Really?  You know what it is?  Uh, I don't know. 
[00:02:00]  We don't have the self-addressed stamped envelope thing anymore?  I don't know if it's in the budget.  We do, Dan?  Yeah, we're actually working on some, uh, getting some new stickers.  Uh, do we have a promo, though, that says, look, if you want to see tits, uh, send a self-addressed  stamped envelope and get your WOW sticker?  We do have a brand new WOW promo with a new, with a new address if you guys want a WOW  sticker out there.  A self-addressed stamped envelope to WOW stickers, 1221 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New  York, 10021.  You know what?  Is that where we are?  I think.  I guess.  I'm never gonna, uh, remember that.  We're on Avenue of the Americas. 
[00:02:30]  What the hell does that mean?  6th Avenue.  Yeah, I know.  So let's just say 6th Avenue.  I know.  I hate when they give it a name.  Avenue of the Americas.  Stop it.  Fashion way.  Because that WOW, uh...  Fashion way.  That WOW thing is just a, it's just a monster.  Yeah.  And now that the weather's getting warm, we're all going to, like, the beaches and the parks  and the sporting events and the concerts.  This WOW thing is perfect, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  You're stuck in traffic, but it's gonna be up to us.  We gotta kind of pump it up again a little bit.  Yeah, we've been lackadaisical during the, uh, crappy weather. 
[00:03:00]  But we don't want to say the same old, same old.  No.  You know, we have this, this same speech we say every single time WOW comes out.  Put your sticker on the sea.  All right.  Da, da, da, da, da.  So just know it's happening.  There are women that will flash.  Yeah.  If they see those WOW stickers on your cars and stuff.  All right?  Right.  Right-o!  Uh, I was reading something in the paper today.  It's gonna drive Jimmy nuts.  Sure it wasn't on a placemat?  No, it was definitely a paper today.  Checking.  It was definitely one of the papers. 
[00:03:30]  Uh, you know, they're closing down, like, Broadway in the Times Square area.  Yes.  Here in New York City.  At 47th Street, the, uh, the mayor has decided that cars should no longer go there.  On roads.  Yeah.  From my way in today, I saw a couple strange things.  They have a brand new bike lane.  Yes.  You saw that?  Um, I know all that, all going down Broadway.  They have it all over the cities that way.  Yeah, and I don't understand how that's not gonna completely fuck up traffic.  I don't understand. 
[00:04:00]  It will.  Because a big chunk of this particular road is now a bike path.  Even Kenny's like, that's pretty wide for a bike path.  It almost looks like a regular lane.  Almost.  You know what it is?  It's being here in this small town we call New York City.  Uh, we should just have pedestrian traffic all over because you don't need cars.  Why would you in Manhattan?  It's not really a major city.  There shouldn't be cars on Broadway.  Well, this is the one thing that's gonna drive you nuts.  So they're gonna close Broadway, I think, uh, Sunday or Monday. 
[00:04:30]  I think it's, it's happening any day now.  Um, and, uh, and on June, uh, I don't have it in front of me, but basically in the very  near future, the first 725 people that sign up get to do yoga where cars used to go.  Who, who thinks this stuff up while we're in economic ruin?  Um, just look at Jimmy's face.  It's mind-boggling, though.  As people lose their minds because they can't get through Times Square anymore, they're gonna 
[00:05:00]  be stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic.  There's gonna be close to a thousand people going, oh.  Doing yoga in the street.  Right.  Where people should be driving.  Right.  That's the great mayor's idea, isn't it?  Yep.  We can only hope that another mayor gets in there that, that, uh, just turns it all around.  And, and lets traffic back through.  And stops with this nonsense of thinking that there's gonna be, uh, uh, uh, like, it's  gonna look like Saigon, uh, where there's just everyone on bicycles. 
[00:05:30]  It's not gonna happen.  How many bicycles are really, are they ripping down there in, like, packs?  No, not really.  Not like other cities.  They just can't get that bike thing going in New York City?  No, because people get killed by trucks.  I'm a big biker.  You got, uh, you know, you got Central Park, which is a, it's a great track to, you know,  to do a little biking.  Hey, you want a bike?  Do that?  Yeah, we can't drive in there.  They're there.  Go ahead.  And every once in a while you see a business guy on a bike, but it's not like, like these  other cities where it's, it's, it's, it's a major thing. 
[00:06:00]  Know who you see on the bikes are the delivery guys.  Yep.  The Yoshis.  He, right, right.  The Yoshis.  The, uh, the little basket full of the Chinese food delivering menus and food to, uh, a hungry  population.  And those guys don't need freaking bike lanes.  They'll, they'll ride right over you to get to their delivery.  And the, uh.  They're insane.  Those guys are insane.  It's those guys and the, um, the black messenger guys on, on the bicycles.  Right.  You ever see those guys?  But those guys drive right in the middle of traffic.  They're maniacs. 
[00:06:30]  They just drive with the cars and the trucks just weaving in and out.  Weaving in and out of trucks and, and cars.  And they, they, they, they got crap all like strapped to them.  Chains.  Big bicycle chains.  And they're just whipping right around traffic.  Yeah.  But the basic biker, it's.  No.  They've been trying, but it's just not happening.  The leisure biker.  Right.  The one that wants to bicycle to work.  The goddamn, uh, uh, what's his name?  Ed Bagley Jr.  He'll be out there. 
[00:07:00]  Who else?  I mean, who, you know, this is a city.  What he's trying to do, the mayor, is trying to eliminate all traffic coming into the city.  He just wants taxi cabs and, uh, I guess delivery trucks to some capacity, uh, to come into the city.  Because he didn't get his way with that, with the, with the, with the pricing.  With the pricing.  So now it's, it's up to him to just do this.  Do the people ever get to vote on things like this?  I was just talking to, oh, I go, I don't know what the deal is with California, but apparently they get to vote on a lot of things with these propositions. 
[00:07:30]  So, uh, uh, Governor Schwarzenegger, uh, wrote up this, this bill about, uh, which had a lot of tax increases in it.  Because they're in, then the shit are over there.  Uh, it went to the voters as a proposition.  And it didn't pass.  It didn't pass.  So he couldn't raise the taxes.  The only thing that passed was these government officials can't get a pay raise when there's a deficit.  Which is like, good, okay, that's good. 
[00:08:00]  But it's more left in the people's hands as far as, uh, you know, how much they're, they're paying, what they're doing.  And, uh, us, we just sit here and, did you get your, um, your fist up the, the ass, uh, letter from New York State?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's that?  Oh, I got that one.  What's that?  Said, uh, hi.  I don't really look at my mail.  Uh, you best put more money aside, uh, during your, um, quarterly New York State taxes.  Because they're going up, and you have to adjust your quarterly so that at the end of the year you don't get socked with a giant tax bill. 
[00:08:30]  So, start giving us more money now.  Ugh.  Like, ugh, ugh, you can start.  You can start now, thank you.  I got that letter yesterday.  Ugh.  The system is flawed.  We also have the best subways and...  No, we don't.  No, but I mean, as far as, you don't need bike lanes because there's a train, there's mass transportation here is, is, is all over the place.  You don't need bike lanes.  But that's what I don't understand, because they talk about how they're going bankrupt. 
[00:09:00]  The MTA takes care of the tunnels and the subways and the buses.  And you go to any other city in America, their subways are beautiful.  It's limited, though.  You don't mind being down there.  You're like, wow, this is really cool.  It's still a shithole underground here in New York City.  And it's the greatest city in the world, supposedly.  It's because they're so old, first of all.  They're very old.  And they've updated the equipment.  But those tunnels and tracks and everything are ancient. 
[00:09:30]  They've been there, some of them, since the early 1900s.  And we also have a lot of people.  And there are a lot of lines.  You go to other cities, like Los Angeles, supposedly, has a subway system.  It's like it goes up a couple of blocks.  Well, it's Earthquake Central, though.  Yeah, yeah, a little.  So they knew they really couldn't get a real involved.  A real good subway system going there.  No.  But things like that and, like, you know, in Boston, whatever they got there.  Boston has a pretty good subway system. 
[00:10:00]  It's old school, but they keep it clean and nice.  New York.  They're like trolleys underground.  There's too many people.  I mean, it's fucking packed in there.  Yeah.  In rush hour when people are getting to work, I don't know because I don't go down there.  I don't go underneath.  You're scared, right?  I stay above ground.  You're scared.  You're scared.  I'm, um...  You'd be surprised how safe it is down there.  Yes.  Except for the, you know, the flashers.  I mean, uh...  But now they're going away because the girls are pulling out their, you know, their cell 
[00:10:30]  phone cameras and getting pictures of these creeps.  I'm a day walker.  A day walker?  Yeah.  I like staying on the surface.  It's frightening down there.  It's kind of fun down there.  No.  No.  It's weird.  You just go down and five minutes later, five minutes later, you're miles away.  Yeah.  You pop up up out of another hole.  Where the fuck am I now?  You're like a fucking animal.  Like a gopher.  Yeah.  You pop up out of another hole.  You pop out over there.  All right.  I'll eat over here.  Like a gopher knows where his home is. 
[00:11:00]  He goes in the hole.  He goes out and pops out and knows where his food is.  What do we do?  Go in, go to a restaurant, come back home.  Like a little troll.  I love the...  I take the train every day home.  Like, it's too early.  We're coming to work.  Are you, Joe Blue Collar?  I really am.  I even have an I Heart New York shirt that I wear so they know I'm a local.  I know you're a local.  Sure.  For the people that want to rob and pillage, come to New York.  These tourists are the dopiest people. 
[00:11:30]  They got so many shopping bags just hanging off their arms.  They're trying to take pictures of the big buildings.  They're looking up.  They're looking away.  Hey, you could get some damage done.  We'll go to the Apple store first and then we'll go to hamburger.  Half these people just leave their bags up on like a cement thing so they can get a picture.  You know how many people are just grabbing their shit and walking over there?  Crime is up in Manhattan. 
[00:12:00]  I wish I had it in me because I walk around and go, this would be the easiest thing ever.  Ever.  I could get iPhones all day long.  Yeah.  All day long.  Yep.  No problem.  Maybe I shouldn't think that way, though.  Hey, Jesse Ventura.  Yeah.  A lot of controversy.  We were in the middle of our Jesse Ventura interview.  I kind of liked that.  It was more of a discussion yesterday, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone was hoping for the big, you know, Anthony gets punched in the face.  Kenny chokes out Jesse Ventura. 
[00:12:30]  You know, that whole thing.  And trust me, I was secretly hoping that there would be some kind of confrontation.  Not that you would get hurt, my friend.  Oh, I...  But it just makes for great radio.  I think...  But it was a good discussion.  Yeah, we did that the first time.  Jimmy really and him got into a pretty good match last time around.  This time it was kind of, let him get his shit out without us interjecting a lot during  what he wanted to say.  And then we comment on what he said.  It was more of a discussion, conversation stuff.  But I was just... 
[00:13:00]  I was stupefied by some of the stuff this guy believes, thinks, theories.  And he pawns it off and tries to make it like, I'm just asking questions.  Well, he would be able to push his agenda forward a little better if he didn't get so  crazy with his theories.  Like, I think you should question the government.  I wonder what the government knew and what they decided not to do.  All that.  I do wonder some of that stuff.  But when you get to, you know, you know how easy it is to demolish the buildings with 
[00:13:30]  that paint and this and that.  I'm like, Jesse...  The exploding paint.  That's where you're losing so many people with your questions.  When I heard him come up with that exploding paint is what took down buildings.  And they can go in there and paint it and then blow it up like a demolition crew would  through weeks, maybe months of drilling holes and placing charges in structural beams.  That's how they do it.  That's how they do it.  Right.  And he's talking about this paint. 
[00:14:00]  Well, first of all, you'd have to rip all the sheetrock off the walls and get to the  beams to paint them if there's exploding paint.  It just sounded ridiculous.  But let me...  Exploding paint.  Let me jump in for a second, Ed.  Because all the conspiracy theory guys, they were losing the argument with exactly what  you're saying.  You're trying to tell me that they demolitioned this building while people are working full  time in the building.  So now in their minds, like, all right, well, yeah, I guess that would be crazy with all  the dust flying and the holes being drilled. 
[00:14:30]  So then they had to come up with another way that it was done.  And someone somewhere out there said, well, they got this paint.  Exploding paint.  And now it's solved that problem with their conspiracy theory.  Yeah.  Because that was a little shaky, right?  Yeah.  I was saying the exploding paint is on the shelf right next to the paint that you paint  the tunnel that you can run through.  And then the person behind you hits the brick wall.  Like on fucking fantasy land exploding paint, is he talking about? 
[00:15:00]  Wouldn't people notice if there was a big wick coming out of the paint?  Yeah.  Every wall's got a fuse sticking out of it.  Super thermite.  Super thermite.  But what I want to discuss is that, I don't know.  I mean, the master computer, it is so stupid.  We've been talking about this for a long time.  This satellite radio is set up in such a way where we can't keep the channel live all  day long.  Yeah.  Which is bizarre to me.  So what happens is, why in between shows does it do that, Dan? 
[00:15:30]  What's that?  Where the computer just, like, knocks us off the air.  That's all programming down in D.C. because we're still running off of XM's, like, scheduling.  But why can't they fix it?  They did.  Well, you know what?  It was there, and then we took it away, and then it was put back for some odd reason,  and now it's gone again.  It is the dumbest thing.  It doesn't make sense.  I don't know why it keeps going back and forth.  I don't know who's making that decision, but it's gone now, so there won't be any kind  of conflict like that.  There's a hard out at, what, 10.51?  There used to be. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, we fixed it after yesterday?  As of yesterday.  So today, it's not there anymore.  So we don't have to discuss this anymore.  Finally, they figured it out.  So Rich Voss won't get interrupted, thank God.  Oh, wow.  Thank the Lord.  Yeah, but at 10.51, the computer literally just takes us off the air to play promos and  whatnot.  And I never understood why, but that's what happened yesterday in the middle of Jesse Ventura  ranted a raven.  We all knew we were running out of show.  We're like, uh-oh.  I didn't think it was going to hit at 10.51.  I thought it was great. 
[00:16:30]  I thought mid-sentence in his babbling, it just went dead.  It did work nicely, right?  It really did.  We had video rolling, and the video was up on the OP Radio YouTube channel.  As to what happened after the mics went off.  What I love is he's trying to continue, and you're being polite, but you can't wait to  get out of here.  You can't get out of here fast enough.  I got my coat on.  I got my bag in my hands.  I'm in running position.  Jimmy's searching for a Sharpie.  All he cares about is an autograph. 
[00:17:00]  Thermite paint.  Thermite paint.  I got fucking, I'm out of here.  Someone else pointed out that Danny's pushing Kenny out of the way.  Just everybody wants out.  Yay.  Especially because he's here.  Yeah.  In general, when the show's over, we all want to just go move on with our lives.  Right.  But yesterday, it just gives you a nice insight.  And it's like, uh-huh, uh-huh.  As he's just packing his bag.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Sounds great.  Sounds great.  And Jimmy's getting all nervous.  Like, I don't know if I'm going to get my autograph. 
[00:17:30]  I don't know if I'm going to get my autograph.  I know.  He's yelling about bomb paint.  You want to leave?  So it's up there if you want to check it out.  And then another video.  It was funny, man.  I got up there.  It was the Duff McKagan performance of, what the hell is the name of the song again?  For some reason, I can't.  Wasted Heart.  Wasted Heart.  By Duff McKagan's band, Loaded.  And I think this video is going to do really well, because the song was amazing.  Really good.  The song was really good.  I'm sitting there going, and all day, we'll be honest again, all day we're kind of sitting 
[00:18:00]  going, Duff's going to come in and play a song.  And, you know, obviously it's not going to be a Guns N' Roses tune.  What is this going to be like?  And then he came on and played a great song.  The song sounded amazing.  He was doing it all acoustic.  It had really nice harmonies.  It sounded like Old Stones.  Yeah, yeah.  That tangy, tangy, that twangy, like, country thing that they were doing early on.  Yeah.  It had a great unplugged acoustic feel to it. 
[00:18:30]  It was really, really a good job.  And then, uh, that video was picked up by a bunch of bloggers and stuff, and we're trying  to figure out if this guy is a fan or not of the show.  Something called The Gauntlet, I think it's called, it was brought to my attention, that  the guy's calling us douchebags as he's trying to promote us, and the Duff McKagan appearance.  I could see how people that like us would call us douchebags, though, too.  Our listeners do.  Yeah.  Is he using the language of the show, or does he really fucking hate us? 
[00:19:00]  Yes.  We have really confused the issue.  That is the language of the show.  Hey, douchebag.  Can you read that?  I can't see it from here.  Sure.  Danny, thanks.  It says, the always interesting Duff McKagan's Loaded made a visit to the Opie and Anthony  show, uh, the Opie and Anthony radio show this morning to perform Wasted Heart for the  Satellite Radio Douchebags.  Blah, blah, blah.  It goes on and on.  But then it goes, uh, and be sure to check out the Opie and Anthony show exclusively on Sirius  XM Satellite Radio, Sirius 197 XM 202.  So, if you guys were really douchebags, why would he give you a nice plug? 
[00:19:30]  I think we are, the way it's said, the, uh, was Satellite Radio Douchebags?  Yeah.  That's, I take that as like a compliment kind of a thing, kind of a...  Well, how about someone ask him?  Yeah, I don't, uh...  How about somebody ask the guy?  I don't necessarily take that as, as complimentary.  I think because we're douchebags on the air.  Oh, yes.  I'm not saying he's, I'm not going to say we can sue him for, for slander.  Nah, I don't care.  Honestly, I don't really carry the way.  I just want to know.  Yeah.  In a, in a weird way, I want to know, was he trying to like, uh, is he a fan or does he 
[00:20:00]  really...  For a little jab.  ...dislike us and is frustrated that he has to promote the fact that we had a nice, you  know, exclusive yesterday.  Exclusive.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Dan the Trucker.  Dan, first call of the day.  Welcome to Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Hey, man.  What's going on, guys?  Trucker Dan here.  How are you?  Hi, Dan.  Hey, I was listening to, uh, I got two weeks of free Howard.  I didn't know.  I never would have known.  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah, it was about two in the morning, nothing else on.  I thought I'd listen in and stuff. 
[00:20:30]  They had Jesse Ventura on their show.  I gotta say, I gotta say, and you might get, might want to get the paddle up.  Isn't it just wonderful to listen to our channel, to hear just nothing but promos, to go somewhere  else?  It's just wonderful.  Yeah.  Still agree?  Yeah.  It just amazes me.  It just amazes me.  I can't believe we lost that argument.  I'm trying to move on, and I think we've done a pretty good job moving on, but it amazes  me.  You listen to this channel, and they're just promoting the shit out of Howard. 
[00:21:00]  Who then bashes us.  Yeah, then they bash us and say we have no listeners.  But they're using our channel to get more listeners for his dopey program.  And management way down the hall has no problem with this, and they don't see it our way that  this can't be good for the Opie and Anthony channel.  They look at us when we have discussions with them about this like we're crazy.  Right.  Like we have no valid point that our listeners are trying to be siphoned off, yet the people 
[00:21:30]  that are siphoning them off are then bashing us, saying that we have no listeners.  Right.  So if we have no listeners, what's the point of advertising on our channel?  Right.  And Noah was told to me, look, you guys aren't going to lose listeners.  They're still going to listen to your show live, but what we're hoping for is maybe a  few of those people then check out Howard when you guys are in replay.  Yeah.  In a perfect world, you hope for that, but the reality is if you promote something, you 
[00:22:00]  are going to get people to go check that out.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah, but it was like two in the morning, so yeah, I mean, I wouldn't listen to it if  it was on like during your show.  No, I'm just saying, listen, you're going to do what you're going to do.  Our whole point with this whole thing is very simple.  All right, if Howard's being promoted like crazy on our channels, all right, promote the  Opie and Anthony show on one of his channels.  That just makes real good business sense.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  And Mel upstairs has always told us, you know, what's good for the company.  You mean they don't do that already?  What's good for the company?  Red Paddle?  Yeah.  I'm just repeating what he used to tell us when we used to go after Howard.  I'm just going Red Paddle.  Is that good for the company?  All right, I'm done.  I can't.  I'm just Red Paddling.  I got a Red Paddle there.  You were doing fine, but no.  It's just that word scares you, right?  Is it good for the company?  You remember here that many times, so I want to know what's good for the company. 
[00:23:00]  Anyway, Dan, so what?  You were listening to Howard yesterday.  What happened?  I would have had Jesse on there, and then, of course, he was going ratting.  And raving with all of his lunacy about the waterboarding and the 9-11.  And at least you guys contested some of the stuff.  They were just sitting there.  Howard was calling Vice President Cheney a warmonger.  They were just agreeing with everything that came out of Jesse's mouth.  I couldn't stand it.  I had to at least turn off during that interview. 
[00:23:30]  I mean, I turned it back on later on.  Does anyone agree with that?  Not to.  He was talking about himself.  You've got to question what Jesse's saying.  Yeah, it's outrageous.  You have to question it.  And they were just kind of like, you know, softballing him and agreeing with him.  And it was like, man, at least Anthony and Jimmy were giving him hell, you know, about everything that came out of his mouth.  Language.  What you want to do is represent the other side because, you know. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  And then after that, it was like Howard talking about Howard.  It's like me, me, me, me.  What a narcissist.  I could not.  There's no way that I would pay $13.99 a month just to get his program.  I just.  It's just.  He was going on about me, me, me, me.  And it's like he's not that interesting.  I don't think.  I mean, it's like.  You know what?  It's just all about Howard.  You know what?  The funny thing.  You might want to get that out already. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, no, no.  No, no.  It's a very good observation, though.  You're going to love this one, Ed.  So I'll be honest.  Recently, I checked out Howard's channels and they're well produced.  I mean, you know, I got to give a little compliment there.  They're well produced.  But Howard's show has always been about getting a bunch of guys in the room to just agree with every single thing Howard says.  We all know that, right?  There's no.  You can't disagree with Howard if you're going to be in that room with him, which is which is just amazing to me. 
[00:25:00]  Like they all just.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, we've done the bits many times.  Yeah.  You're right.  Everyone just kisses his ass and agrees with whatever he says.  If Howard.  If I got it, I got a bail on you, bro.  Thank you, though.  Bye, mister.  Goodbye.  If Howard has a problem with Kevin Smith, the whole room now has a problem with Kevin Smith.  Right.  That's one of the latest things they're doing over there.  Right.  No one in the room is allowed to go.  I don't know.  Well, Howard, I like it.  It's all about if Howard doesn't like something, the whole room has to not like something. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  So it's pretty much they pretty much just kiss their ass, which I don't know how you do radio that way.  Whatever.  But it's worked for Howard and those guys.  I would be embarrassed, quite frankly, to be in that room.  And my whole job is to kiss his ass and agree with everything he has to say.  But the new thing is, after the show's over, they continue to kiss his ass with a post-show.  Where they get a bunch of guys, I don't even know, sometimes it's Boy Gary, I guess,  and they sit around and discuss how great Howard was that morning. 
[00:26:00]  Dude, it is amazing.  It's hysterical.  It's amazing.  They brought it to the next level.  Not only do they kiss his ass during the live show and never disagree with him,  now they've got a post-show where they continue the ass-kissing.  There's not enough time in a regular show to kiss his ass enough.  They need extra kiss-ass time.  It was unbelievable to me.  Unbelievable.  That's, uh, I don't know what goes on on that side of the building. 
[00:26:30]  I don't want to know.  Whatever.  It's on our radar because of what they did to us with these promos.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all.  We were doing just fine before they came to us with the dumb promo thing.  With the one-sided promo thing.  One-sided.  All right, we can move on.  What else we got?  What else we got?  What else were we talking about?  Drop something, Dan.  In the news.  That swine flu case.  Yeah, well, the kid.  The 16-month-old. 
[00:27:00]  Did not have swine flu.  So, so, we're down to one death.  And I bet you the news.  The death rate for the swine flu dropped 100%.  Yeah.  Yeah, we had two.  Now it's down to one again.  To one guy.  And I bet you the media knew that there was questionable circumstances with the 16-month-old dying.  Yeah.  And if they looked into it further, they probably would have been able to say the kid didn't die from the swine flu.  But it makes for way better TV saying that we have another death and it's a child. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  That's perfect for the news.  Oh, they love it.  Perfect.  They have to, yeah, they have to keep people tuning in.  And so, they said that the baby had swine flu.  When it turns out, it didn't.  And then the guy that died had all kinds of underlying health problems.  And...  What was his main problem?  Did he have the diabetes?  I think he had the gout.  Is what they were saying.  For real?  For real.  I heard from somebody that it was the gout.  I don't even understand that gout thing.  What's the gout?  What is it? 
[00:28:00]  Is it like rotting while you live or something?  I think it's something like that.  Really?  Yeah, it's a weird...  You get it in your feet a lot.  His immune system was a little iffy.  The gout is...  You're rotting while you're alive?  I'm probably stating that.  I'm sure there are medical professionals who are disagreeing.  More than just getting dry skin?  Because that's, I guess, rotting, right?  Well, I think it's a deeper rot.  In your joints and stuff?  Yeah, I think you're just rotting.  Come on!  I don't really know what the gout is.  Should we wake up Dr. Steve?  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Maybe...  I love waking up Dr. Steve.  He writes us after the show going,  I hope I sounded good this morning because my phone rang  and I was on the radio with you guys 10 seconds later after waking up.  I don't even know what I said.  I'm like, that's good.  You're giving real important medical advice  and you don't even know what you said because you just woke up.  He's got the...  voice still.  Morning voice.  All right, we're going to learn about the gout today.  Yeah, Danny, research the gout.  The gout.  Not just gout. 
[00:29:00]  I brought in a couple of prizes to give away  because you said we didn't have a prize closet.  Oh, yeah.  When are we going to get a prize closet?  Well, I've started one.  Oh.  With things my parents gave me for Christmas,  which may not be needed.  All right.  We hate your stuff from Christmas.  Well, there's tremendous gifts.  What do you got today?  I only have two little things.  Why don't we just use the one Steve came sashaying out of?  You want to show us now, Jimmy?  We don't have to.  Are you going to give these to listeners? 
[00:29:30]  Well, I don't know.  The staff may want to fight over these things.  Oh, I bet.  Is it another sweater from Mom?  No clothing.  No Van Heusen's?  Oh, no Van Heusen.  Oh, that's a bummer.  No, these are both from Christmas this year.  Wait, let's get the gout thing out of the way.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  Let's do gout thing.  Focus on what you brought in, Jimmy.  Oh, they're big gifts.  Ouch.  Danielle from Boston.  Come on, boys.  How are you?  Hi, Danielle.  All right.  The gout is a buildup of uric acid in your joints, and it's very painful.  It sort of feels like what people that have arthritis have. 
[00:30:00]  Uric acid?  Is that like pee-pee?  Well, not really.  It's like a byproduct of things that break down in your system, and it just ends up collecting in your joints.  It's very, very painful.  Does it rot your joints away?  It doesn't really rot your joints away.  It sort of makes them all inflamed.  They have several medications that you can take to treat it, and then anti-inflammatory medications for pain.  I don't like the sound of the gout.  No.  Yeah, no, it's not something that you want. 
[00:30:30]  I don't want the gout.  How do you get the gout?  I don't know.  How do you get the gout?  How do you get it?  You get the gout from eating, like, really rich foods.  Foods with gout in them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, rich foods?  Yeah, like, well, you know, like cheese, a lot of cheese and stuff like that.  Oh, I love my cheese.  I do, too.  One of the greatest treats of all time.  Cheese.  So what, if you stop eating the cheese, you'll stop getting the gout?  Well, it'll have to.  Ow! 
[00:31:00]  Holy shit!  Yeah, I don't want that.  What picture was that, Danny?  A picture of the gout.  Let me see.  It kind of swells up the joints.  Oh, my gout!  Yes.  That's horrible.  The name says it all.  The knuckles are all swollen.  How much cheese do you eat before your fingers look like that?  How do rats do it?  It's like finger poppers.  They're just full of cheese.  Yeah, how about you slow down on the cheese consumption?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus!  I can't look at the pictures of gout. 
[00:31:30]  No.  That is horrible.  I'm a little teapot.  Imagine some short and gout.  Can I ask Daniel something?  Imagine somebody coming up and going, hey, how you doing?  And holding that hand out to shake it.  And squeezing it.  Oh, and just cheese comes out.  Just squirts on your face.  Cheese whiz.  Hey, Danielle.  Yes.  Can you get the gout in your cock?  Ah.  No, there's no joints in your cock, Ope.  So it's all about the joints.  So you say.  Yeah.  Yeah, we call it a joint, though, don't we?  A joint. 
[00:32:00]  You know, there's a joint.  You stick with the old joint.  So what is it?  Typically hands and feet, usually.  Hands and feet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Didn't soldiers get the gout?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It sounded like something soldiers got.  Who was the most famous person to get the gout?  Ah.  I would say Ernest Hemingway.  I'm just going to say he had the gout, whether he did or not.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, boys.  Have a good day.  Danielle helping us out with the gout.  That was good enough.  If you need to know more, go Google it. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, go to gout.com.  What the fuck you want from us?  On your gout station.  Hey, Jimmy, can we go to break first?  Okay.  It's a good tease.  People will come back.  We're all about the radio tease, aren't we?  People will hang around for these gifts.  Stuff that Jimmy's parents gave them for various occasions, I guess.  Jimmy just must be hard to part with them.  Yeah.  Can you just, like, pull one out of the bag?  We won't say what it is, just to get our reaction.  I have a fun treat for us, too.  All right.  We'll make the radio show much better. 
[00:33:00]  Oh.  Let's just say.  More gay porn?  No, no, no, no.  I wouldn't share that.  Good.  What is that?  Exactly.  Oh, no.  Wait, what was that?  I don't even know.  It's a good gift.  Why would anyone get you that?  It's a good gift.  All right.  That's a great tease.  We go to break with the Ron Howard thing.  The Ron Howard laugh is taking on a life of its own.  He came in here to promote Angels and Demons, which is doing very well at the box office.  And we noticed that he laughed a lot during his interview with us.

[00:38:00]  underwear well not at all surprisingly this was forwarded to me by travis ah what are we looking  at that dan well it's a man i guess he's wearing a mesh thong yeah it's a mesh thong so you can see  his junk right through it oh boy is that uh is that a little he kind of looks like john mayer  for extra sexy for extra sexy so anyway jimmy your parents gave you a couple things you didn't like  you brought them into the show but i figured others would love them more maybe to start uh the prize 
[00:38:30]  closet jimmy's very giving so he took stuff that he treasures and cherishes gifts from his parents  and he's bringing them in and i brought something that will make our show a lot more fun oh all right  all right here's the gifts from my uh my parents there's only two this one this this one you held up  earlier and uh it's in the pristine unopened box it's the uh the luggage locator luggage locator 
[00:39:00]  what what is what is the theory behind the luggage locator well you locate your luggage  with the push of a button it beeps and flashes up to 60 feet away safe for air travel you have to  attach this to your luggage and then you have to if you cannot find your luggage there's two there's two  take a remote control for the garage you have one part attached to the luggage and the other part 
[00:39:30]  you carry with you conveniently and you press it i guess your luggage will beep and flash  not unlike a bomb and then security yes will run over grab your bag put it outside and hit it with a  water cannon that's a grandmother gift where you give it to your grandma because she's traveling for  the last time in her life to maybe say goodbye to some relatives yeah yeah before she's put in the  home back back back here yes right you could put it on granny herself exactly locate her wherever she 
[00:40:00]  is you avoid her the problem with the gift there's many problems you have to still be 60 feet away from  your lost luggage uh yes which who is that close and doesn't see it right yeah it's not even your lost  like i guess it's in on the carousel if it's on the baggage carousel and you're like i can't find it  going in a circle it's the one with the pink ribbon on it just put a bright some kind of bright  sticker on your luggage and you're good or just stand there and it will come back around and 
[00:40:30]  recognize it look at your luggage right who's gonna be pressing this button where's my luggage  well jimmy it's very thoughtful because you do a lot of traveling so they figure this is perfect for  i do and i have a luggage locator it's called kenny here it is there's one it is how many of those  luggage locators you think they sold i i count one i had to be in the tens tens yeah if i was a  luggage handler in the plane i would just smash the thing out of principle and um oh jimmy's got 
[00:41:00]  something else this is great what are we doing with the luggage locator how about the first person  i can call up and spell colostomy no no what is that this is no no just stop you see what it is  it why would they get you that this is a really good one honestly um this is the ll bean first watch  weather station it's a two-piece electronic gizmo i love gizmos that you are a fan of the gizmo 
[00:41:30]  i like gadgets more than gizmos i'm more of a gizmo gizmo fucking gizmo gizmo what's the worst  gizmo ever there's the question i'm holding it well let's see if someone can beat your gizmo  this is a two-part wireless indoor outdoor temperature clock with calendar alarm and snooze  so what happens is there's a piece of this that you like the the thermometer you hang outdoors yeah  that goes outside which i you know i live on the 10th floor of a building in new york i guess i 
[00:42:00]  should just drill scale the side and uh windows don't open for the most part and there's a uh a  little uh uh the ll bean thing you have here and it's got an alarm and stuff and i guess if i push  this button it will give me a temperature reading from my room are you kidding to outside the window  wow as opposed to the iphone let me take my iphone let me open it up and uh hit this button that says  weather and uh as this pops on i could tell you right now it is going to hit uh the mid to upper 
[00:42:30]  70s 78 degrees 54 is the low i get the five day forecast by the way i could tell what's happening  right now the high the low mostly sunny pleasant warm and that was with a push of the button on my iphone  in mere uh second that's why that stinks this is good because this is a two-part system that has  batteries and uh a snooze light and memory and a mode for all of your time and temperature needs 
[00:43:00]  oh look at that in fahrenheit and centigrade yes i always like to have both what about kelvin  um i don't know temperature in kelvin why don't we use the kelvin thing i don't i it's always celsius  or fahrenheit kelvin gets uh yeah left out that is kelvin used for awful yeah i don't even know  the scientists use the kelvin oh i'm sure the scientists love the kelvin oh yeah uh what is 
[00:43:30]  that in and out what does that mean what the hell does that mean it's giving you your indoor  and outdoor temperature stop it all right that i can't get right now on my iphone i can get it with  a thermometer in the house but i don't have one i don't need one i don't know sometimes because i go  to sleep a lot of times i don't know if i should sleep nude or in my parka yes so sometimes i'll  wake up and i'll put my parka on immediately and walk around the house in snowshoes in a parka  i hate your gizmo you know i hate it it's terrible give it to me i have to smash a singing dildo would 
[00:44:00]  have been more helpful you will let me smash the gizmo no it's a big prize that's so much better than  something else that tells me my indoor temperature the thermostat or how about how about do i get  goosebumps on my arms or not how about my body and i know if i'm cold yeah i don't care about the  temperature do you care if it's exact it's like you know it feels but my thermometer says uh 73 
[00:44:30]  it so feels 72 in here i'm a little chilly yes i prefer 74.1 but that's me and you could tell  yeah you had your little thermometer there i better put a sweatshirt on and put some heat on  i kind of go by feel when it comes to temperature and comfort level things like that right um  wow those are wait really bad it's really bad but look at the smile no i don't want to have  tapping the last thing he's got in his bag the parlor game i have for the show and you're smart 
[00:45:00]  enough to save the best for last right jimmy honestly no no those two are just the gifts and  this other gift was fun because i throw a lot of parties but this is actually what i like  but i won't use it okay um but i think that we will have hours of fun oh this is a black  right there uh we will have hours of fun around with the godfather trivia game wow yay  look at that it's got the the cover from the book and even trivia game is written in that godfather 
[00:45:30]  font yeah and um it smells good like when you open it yeah it smells like new game right  smells like new game that is good there are cards it's not even a video game there it's it's an old  fashioned card type game it's a good game to play in a blackout yes because a lot of times you're  sitting around with friends and some candles um and there's three decks of cards godfather godfather  two and godfather three uh take well take three and just throw them away hey i don't know why it's 
[00:46:00]  unwrapped oh yeah good see and um well you can have some fun with the uh the uh i guess you're  all right let me let me let me play uh the game show let me play the game show host and you guys  try to answer all right i think that's fair no because i have a feeling these cards will  oh fuck why god i thought i had yeah right damn it throw that damn it all right give it to me dan  now this is going to be fun why don't you read a couple of godfather trivia questions yes and how 
[00:46:30]  about this the first one to get the question right doesn't have to blow everyone in the room  well that's putting a lot of pressure on us there is get it wrong okay all right this one's kind of  tough all right all right how did k and michael lose the baby she got an abortion they left it in  the plane jimmy you are wrong oh of course they got an abortion can we write the answers down

[00:50:30]  probably have broken facial bones and and uh why don't boxers have broken like facial bones i guess  they use gloves i think yeah come on kenny just bare-fisted punched you with that big  kenny mitt oh with all that anger in him you would pray that you would be knocked out instantly so you  don't feel nothing you would pray that's right oh and you know what you ever look at his knuckles  because he punches the heavy bag without gloves does he yes wow he is a maniac uh one more trivia 
[00:51:00]  question this is fun the phones are exploding you're bringing the fun here's an entertaining  question all right what was the room number of veto's hospital room  one 21 222 8 4 78 keep going three numbers or two numbers 69 
[00:51:30]  just did that to make everyone laugh how many a charm how many numbers or digits in the number  one seven  no one two three four five six seventy nine got it it was number two  number two when i win  jimmy everyone wants your awful gizmos the well you know what the uh the instructions you know you're  for a good game when the instructions were all in one sheet of paper it said ask questions last one 
[00:52:00]  awake is considered the winner  yeah what's the object it's not like trivial pursuit where you have a thing and you you move  around the you have a scorecard look at the scorecard it's just a basic notepad a bunch of silhouettes  of gangsters and like gangster fedora hat silhouettes and and it's in some kind of a  um bowling mob family yes a tree thing where you have the the don at the top and then you're a capo 
[00:52:30]  regime yeah it tells you what you have in the oh this is what's in the box 300 say what's it in the  box that would be good if they put it in stereotypical wop like dialect 300 godfather trivia cards with 900  questions one score pad one pencil and instructions you know that they're reaching when they list the  thing you're holding they forgot to mention clear plastic packaging and air 
[00:53:00]  wait on the instructions instructions what's in it yeah and one of the things is the instruction  yes or in parentheses you're holding it asshole and then the next thing it says is the offer you  can't refuse oh see because yeah be the first player to assemble a family in quotes of 10 people  each correct answer earns you a new family member  gotcha so you you you like color in the family or you you know check them you can you can put a hit 
[00:53:30]  on someone at any point during the game a player may put a hit on another player how does that you  literally kill them yes oh okay because you find out that your spouse has been fucking your friend of  color i know it says no both of you and the person are putting a hit on must have at least one family  members shaded in in an attempt to hit it's just what happens with the hit i don't know to attempt  to hit on your next turn before the question reader grabs the next card to read state that you're 
[00:54:00]  putting a hit on someone like let's just say the four oh my god oh you put a hit on me oh oh i put  it on you let's say the four of us are sitting around with our dick and balls hanging out a bunch of  men naked right and someone's already eaten the crackers so that game is over we're all drained  of cum and let's just say that dan wants to put a hit on anthony oh boy it says uh on your next turn 
[00:54:30]  before the question reader grab like let's just say opens the question reader yeah grabs the next card  to read state that you are putting a hit on someone so danny would say i'm putting a hit on anthony oh  whoa now what we'd all react and oh i remember him why why are they making this so complicated  it's dumb trivia you get it right but that's yourself a point gotta give it an angle a god  hey i'm gonna put a hit on you huh hey it's horrendous look you got all over the cards you got 
[00:55:00]  him out of my gosh yeah oh what happened that's the fanucci question that's got the sorts on the  card i keep the cards wrapped up and tape them to my heels they weren't good as lids  the godfather three pile is better i use it on my right side i'm putting a wig on you i'm gonna hit  freudian slur yeah shoot a cannonball in my wig see if it goes all the way through 
[00:55:30]  so now when you success what what oh my god to do a hit on somebody no more no i have to know  do you then answer a question if you're putting a hit on the person reading the card another player  must read the card for this round uh-huh with two players the player attempting to hit ask the question  once the hit has been announced i'm putting a hit on anthony oh boy both the hitter and the intended 
[00:56:00]  victim prepare to answer the question all right already the hit question is the last question on  each card indicated by the symbol and it's got a hit with four bullet holes around it oh i got it  were they trying too hard on this exactly or what i mean godfather trivia is cool in general you don't  really need to like uh ramp it up with the hit read a reader trivia a typical hit a question it's the  last one with the bullet holes around it dan let's see just cut a random hit card dan who said 
[00:56:30]  this is the business we've chosen uh yeah that was uh that was uh this is the business we've chosen  it was mo green no i don't think it was mo green michael i i think that was uh oh was it hyman roth  yes talking about oh yeah it was hyman roth you're correct sirs so now what happens name well uh 
[00:57:00]  should the hitter answer the question correctly which i did yes  the hit is pulled off and the victim must cross out one of his or her shaded family members  oh no and then leave on his or her score sheet then it says leave the gun take the cannoli it  doesn't say that it does no stop it read it i'm not gonna read it leave the gun take the cannoli  i am so annoyed right oh i'm i have douche chills from this game what are they doing should the 
[00:57:30]  intended victim answer first uh-huh i guess whoever yells it out first right so it's like a you know  let's do it like that when me and i try to answer together i didn't or all three of us actually  okay here we go here we go is this a regular question now or a hit question question danny  i'm going with veto before you okay i'm going blind i'm going in blind my answer is veto my god  why not should the yes i can see by his face i'm right should they change cards i promise i won't 
[00:58:00]  should the intended victim answer first the hit is a botched attempt in this case the hitter must  cross over a member of his own family never hate your enemies it affects your judgment  should neither player answer the question correctly play continues to the left with  neither player losing a family member note neither player gains any additional family members for 
[00:58:30]  answering the hit question correctly the person putting the hit on does not go again and cannot earn a  family member this round winning the game the first player to successfully shade in 10 silhouettes  not counting hit family members you know i was trying to like follow jimmy you lost me  10 minutes ago why this is very complicated fun game for all you get the most important part the  loser of the game the actor that played mccluskey comes over and punches you in the jaw yes sterling hayden 
[00:59:00]  fucks your mouth that is him very good jimmy a lot of people very excited about the game steve what  do you got  you guys are killing me it's horrible it really is dan read a hit question and we'll all rush to it okay  you guys ready yeah in the godfather part two veto corleone i said veto already uh no you didn't start

[01:03:00]  dj now yeah he went through the disco thing didn't work the classic dance thing didn't work i i feel bad  about that but either there's so many musical formats for him to choose from that i think one  will hit maybe it is country yeah yeah i'm a natural you're a natural all right kenny they're not  going to clean up the the glass now they will during a commercial break oh kenny's going to rack 
[01:03:30]  some head and make sure that's unless you don't want him to uh yeah before management gets here yeah  what would management say  okay  what's next  that was a good one he put a lot of gusto in that  i got good pipes you do you do yeah overpower no brains but good pipes  look at the size of your suits they're just like he's giant you're a giant of a man 50 too long 
[01:04:00]  nobody believes me jimmy could you put uh kenny's uh suit jacket on oh i would like to see that this  is a picture made for yeah this is a twitterer everyone get their twitter i already twittered it  no you didn't everybody gets ready with their their cameras oh my god how adorable it's like when  the little rascals got on each other's shoulders okay wait he's making the oh my stupid iphone takes

[01:05:30]  right that has a certain matter to it and then jimmy's reaction on um the uh youtube video that i'll put up  on twitter when you guys got cut off and he fucking ripped his his headphones off like he was going to  throw him through a goddamn window it's priceless oh yeah that's all on the video that is it that  was captured very well because uh you know not people don't know what happens when we get cut off  like that after the fact you got to see like jimmy go what the fuck was that yeah i was i i didn't even 
[01:06:00]  know that was being taped yeah and the weird thing is that i did i didn't hear it yesterday but i  listened to the replay last night after i saw the video and it was just fucking mid-sentence it  sucked so how did i rip his ass i don't remember having really a confrontation with him at all  no no no you jimmy you were you were you were uh you got him with facts and finesse no but i'm no  no but i mean there was really no uh i actually we agreed with him on certain things um so you did  but you did at one point you're like no you're a goddamn wrestler and a politician that's not how 
[01:06:30]  you think about things you're screaming at him it's great okay cool all right boys punch out  all right and a fart we uh the ventura stuff continued after the show we got we got this  clip that was just handed to me and i think sam did kind of a uh ona backstage because as uh jesse  was doing ids he just continued with the 9-11 thing so we got a lot of new jesse uh material today  including this and now jesse ventura talking crazy for 30 seconds and go first of all let's look at the 
[01:07:00]  government's theory and i call theirs a theory too they've never proven any of this who would  know go back to when do you remember pain stewart the golfer what's the real big picture here who's  seen the manifest the government won't release the manifests when have you seen them now here the plot  thickens i i used to do a lot of body surfing and boogie boarding but now i'm trying to make the  transition at this late time in my life to board surfing all right let's go to the pentagon why why 
[01:07:30]  june 1st and then you got and then it ties in when cheney was down in the bunker it was almost  like they knew and that was jesse ventura talking crazy on the opium show we should have a series of  those that's that's definitely funny man oh and here's backstage with uh ona jesse ventura wow just  walked in so basically what you're going to hear here is the uh some of the audio that is part of the uh  the video uh i put up yesterday on the youtube channel op radio and more stuff because then he 
[01:08:00]  went into another studio to cut ids and he just continued oh he did oh yeah so check this out  and now backstage with ona here is prime time sam roberts i'm prime time sam roberts and former  governor of minnesota jesse the body ventura came by the opium anthony show recently to talk about some  of his political opinions while talking about his 9 11 theories the computers cut the show off 
[01:08:30]  luckily for you we were standing by and rolling as jesse ventura didn't let the fact that he was  no longer on the radio stop his diatribe because hey it's opie from opie and anthony oh geez they  cut us right off what cut us off the computer the computer shut us off the computer just shut us  off at 11 o'clock we didn't do that what happens is we're on a massive computer and they it's it's  no my only thing is this i talked to people who were i talked to two guys one guy who was brought in 
[01:09:00]  front of the 911 commission they took him in a private room who told what he knew he was dismissed and  today there's no record of him being there because of what he talked about i talked to another guy  that spent 256 days at the cleanup site he found the black boxes and yet our government tells us they  were destroyed they were never found why why why does our government behave that way you know why 
[01:09:30]  why do they make it look like these are in fact the case if that is in fact the case then i have no  idea why man jesse you sure know a lot of people after leaving the on-air studio jesse headed into  another studio to cut liners with ona's developmentally challenged executive producer  steve c i'm sure once getting out of the on-air studio ventura was done talking about his 9 11  theories i think that was a spirited debate i think that went well and i don't want to just get tied up 
[01:10:00]  on 9 11 you know too many people get me tied up on that but i'm betting my pilot doesn't see the  light of day they're not going to allow it to be shown because i talked to guys that found the black  boxes and yet our government says they weren't discovered why well i found out why too they put  the hijackers in the cockpit before the plane even left the ground and they don't want people to know that  you know how it's a common courtesy if you've got a commercial pilot license they'll put you in the  jump seat and that's why i get irritated when people try to tell me oh you're full of 
[01:10:30]  shit bull crap you know i come from the vietnam era generation when they lied to us about the gulf of  tonkin we ready this is jesse ventura and you're listening to the opian anthony show i stand corrected  thanks for coming by governor ventura and i'm sure somewhere someone believes your crazy stories  i'm primetime sam roberts and this is back stage with ona we're uh we're still live i i the the 
[01:11:00]  problem my god i think it's pretty obvious i think a lot of people will agree when people say  i talked to this guy and he's saying right right name the guy yeah who's the guy who's the guy because  i i'm so sick of this vague well i was uh talking to this guy and he says yeah but that's easy to say  because there's no you know what i mean there's there's no name given they were in the cockpit before 
[01:11:30]  the plane left the ground really were they just stop and one guy found both black boxes how busy  was this guy found one here's another one was he the only one doing the digging he found both of them  yeah they're like that guy finds everything i can't find my keys call him  yeah two separate buildings huge collapse and he's the guy that finds them maybe he had a luggage  finder on the black box 
[01:12:00]  stupid luggage horrendous stinks i hate the luggage finder hey you know what else came in a black box  that stupid godfather game i wish that would get lost  maybe it was just two fucking games the guy just stop they weren't in the cockpit  how do you know were you there it's courtesy to put him in the jump seat yeah how do you know  not that box cutters yeah yeah exactly he talked to the guy you didn't talk to the guy 
[01:12:30]  put a commercial did you talk to the guy did i talk to the guy he talked to the guy he talked to the  guy but you didn't talk to the guy so what did you say and just because you took uh flight lessons  in a jet um simulator doesn't mean you can ride in the jump seat if you work for the airline  that's another thing if you're a pilot for another airline  i don't think you could just go hey you know i know how to fly one of these things can i sit here  we can't keep waterboarding a secret do you really think they're gonna be able to keep that 
[01:13:00]  a secret oh yeah they put them up there in the cockpit to sit down and chit chat yeah  a little chit chat oh sorry what's the altitude i gotta slit your throats stop jesse they were  on the cockpit yes cockpit before it even left the ground you know what we should play i got it in  front of me hit someone with a chair dummy and we were gonna hit some uh we were gonna hit jesse  with some knowledge the dr michio kaku michio kaku what do you mean cookie little cookie  men took over the flight pinocchio didn't do this cookie man michio kaku we we didn't get to this 
[01:13:30]  yesterday because we just ran out of time yeah but he explained the towers falling of course using  something called physics physics physics there's something it's called a certain type of theory  which explains the rate that the building first of all the towers are more or less designed to do that  so it succeeded in that sense otherwise the towers would have tipped over on its side in which case 
[01:14:00]  you would have wiped out most of manhattan uh lower lower east side wall street so they were this  dr michio kaku is a sick fuck yes you would have wiped out if it fell sideways but he's laughing as  he talks about wiping out thousands upon thousands of people but it wouldn't have wiped out manhattan how  tall do you think the buildings were people in harlem getting hit by building debris  get a hold of yourself yeah simmer down would you how high were the buildings 
[01:14:30]  how many feet i could do 1100 feet all right there's an antenna on martin luther king boulevard yes  and it killed everybody in spanish harlem the antenna killed everybody in spanish harlem all the glass  shattering killed everybody from hell's kitchen all through chelsea it's the same place  1100 feet is uh not even a quarter mile my friends no so so it would wipe out maybe a quarter  mile if it's not even less than white people have had people in the basements or people uh 
[01:15:00]  there were about people uh you wouldn't have the entire lower east side west of it how did it have fallen  and one it killed everyone from like say the wall street area up to let's just not say all of  manhattan let it didn't hit inwood let's say up to the beginning of washington heights  it would have killed everybody from brooklyn to the tappansy bridge  if you picked up the buildings like sticks and just started beating the city with them like 
[01:15:30]  fucking olive branches if you if you were fucking cloverfield that monster well you would need  cloverfield to tip it over to begin with yeah yeah you would need a nice around a little bit  you would need a nice push from behind to get that uh going everybody on the lower east side too  it would have killed everybody and then it would have made a right on seventh avenue  and circled back paid the toll all right you're talking about uh and uh lower lower east side wall 
[01:16:00]  street so they were supposed to basically collapse like a pancake downward now some people think that  maybe explosives brought down the world trade center but explosives are placed on the bottom of a building  the world trade center collapsed from the top not the bottom it's showing that explosives were not  involved in the collapse of the world trade center god why didn't we get like uh meet you on the phone  with jesse he wouldn't have but that wasn't that wasn't that wasn't math theoretic that wasn't physics  proof like jesse uh would have talked about no there's all i don't know who this guy is but there was 
[01:16:30]  the demolition and you know because big explosives are placed throughout the building not just yes yes  they're they're painted on with exploding paint and then some people say well fire does not melt  steel therefore it must have been george w bush who brought down the world trade center well of  course fire cannot melt i cannot melt steel fire weakens steel and that's all you need that's all it  had to do that's all it had to do was weaken the steel to make the whole thing buckle one by one 
[01:17:00]  by one not to interrupt you but what was the stuff because it looks like there's people go look at the  video there's liquid coming out of the building see that's melted steel what is that that looks like  something melted steel which couldn't happen well it's not melted steel it's softened steel but lots  of debris came out and uh there was all sorts of stuff inside the world trade center it was a  it was a working metropolis with thousands of individuals so as it went down uh you to look  at the videotapes you can't really tell what was coming out because there is too small and the 
[01:17:30]  resolution of the tape is not very good the point is it went down according to the laws of physics and  it was more or less designed to do that wow it's dr michu kaku but i love how he giggles through his  whole yeah he's telling you he's and then and then there was something called the holocaust  he's like laughing through horrible things if it fell forward and the wind was right it would  have killed some people in connecticut too oh meet you did it does it get faster as it's coming down 
[01:18:00]  uh slightly faster but not much faster it's free fall the building was basically in free fall  because there was nothing preventing in other words this building is basically air if you think  about it a building is basically air like why why can battleships float battleships are  made out of solid steel and the answer is they're hollow uh same thing with the world trade center  the world trade center was basically hollow so as it collapsed it could collapse more or less at the  rate of free fall but i don't like the fact that he said that because i i like ships that are made of 
[01:18:30]  solid lead where there's where people just have to sit on the very tip top of them like a giant  like a giant golf tee floating in the uh water and there's no bathrooms and you have to be careful you  don't get knocked over the side because your ship is solid lead you know it's not very uh smart  economical now rain would get all over you of course a big lead boat all right we should take a break 
[01:19:00]  uh and get rich voss in here where's voss he's down the hole where's that faggot we'll talk to rich voss next  what else yeah that's it for now  hey look who's uh in studio with us today rich voss everyone what's happening what's up rich we  almost died this one last night why what happened for real who did we uh we got a hotel in new york  and they upgraded us to a suite first of all price line 118 bucks then upgraded

[02:32:30]  poor bonnie  we're not on the air right now  like what does he do at home that you would say like are you for real  like he'll say like uh how do you spell between  look there's some words you're like  no you know what i do now i just get i get reina to tell him  rich says you guys don't make out anymore and that made me really sad 
[02:33:00]  that made me really sad yeah there should be some you know some romance and kissing and stuff  i can't it's too much to go into  all right  i need to be laying down with a therapist  oh rich yeah we're going to start kissing again and then he doesn't understand he he said  something like you call him selfish and i'm like all right and then his example was like yeah  like you know i go play golf all day while she stays home with the baby  yeah and then he doesn't understand why you might call him selfish well here like there's 
[02:33:30]  certain things like he just okay like i'll have the baby and two bags and a stroller strapped on my  back and a car seat in another hand and he'll be walking up ahead with his little fag bag  you know not offering to help or carrying him be like car hurry up  what an ogre she's a fucking frog girl you're strong it's not like you  fucking haven't plowed before is he not thoughtful he's he's completely insensitive 100 wow uh we're 
[02:34:00]  also looking at something called oapedia.com and it has a whole list of the words that rich  voss has mispronounced over the years it's fantastic and it's so lengthy is pavarati on the  list of course oh yeah all right when when rich asked if if the pavarati were at my wedding  well not only the pavarati but also the paparazzi yeah the paparazzi  what's the word instead of pofah well faux-pah 
[02:34:30]  is going up on that list so you miss someone ah  fuck i just mixed up the f and the p that's all and i'll acknowledge i i butcher the language but  not to the extent of uh mr rich voss john kuzak what's that no one expects you to be perfect  you know it'd be funny if you made a mistake now and again yeah not every time again it's good  it's all right but there it becomes a line where it's like not only do people not expect you to be  perfect ron and flitz 
[02:35:00]  these are all real things you've said on our show i don't i've never said all these yes you know  sometimes you know you you i remember most of these sometimes you're just whatever and you're  talking fast yeah yeah but who could forget the wonderful delicious sclone  has tortillas on there of course it has to be yeah there it is bonnie someone actually wrote how 
[02:35:30]  does rich voss make it through a day i because he's because he's arrogant about it you call  the tsunami a tusami yeah no he'll say something he'll go it's tusami he'll correct  me he'll correct you and he goes no no lisa it's tusami um how do we how do we uh tell her the big  news today well rich you want to tell her no well rich rich uh we were talking about um twitter 
[02:36:00]  and how you twitter and and does rich twitter and stuff like that we wanted to see his site and give  out uh his twitter address so we can get more people right because we all give out our twitter  addresses and uh and get a lot of people up there and it's good for updating gigs or whatever you want  to do so he gave out his twitter uh thing he said well it's uh it's uh comic two thirty six thirty  comic six thirty he gave his code yes yes he which was quickly picked up by everybody by everybody in 
[02:36:30]  the audience and we realized that it's his password for everything by the way so he gave out on an  international radio show his password to everything twitter facebook and his email but  listen to what she's saying she's like oh holy shit yeah and if you look she's going oh my oh my  if you look at his twitter you'll see a picture of a horse's ass so asinine yeah oh my just quick 
[02:37:00]  it's a mistake i'm glad he's not doing twitter anymore because honestly i can't keep up with how  many things he needs to spell why does he make does he make spelling errors on twitter or it's a  spell check he'll also be like he'll also be like oh how do you spell that it's endless it's just this  constant wait where i'm like i i refuse to spell for twitter bonnie he they we printed one we printed 
[02:37:30]  out of pages of the what they call vocabulary which is the words he's mispronounced five five pages  that we tape together can i just say something in rich's defense yeah thank you um he he never  went to school he was a drug addict um he doesn't read at all not not even wait there's a couple of  joys in here uh instead of rolls royce he called it a roast rice no i didn't instead of roy shiner

[02:39:00]  known bonnie he was having a great i'm no joke a great appearance on our show killing didn't miss  one joke one line and i actually said on the air i go something's gonna go wrong now because he he  doesn't he feels uncomfortable when he's doing well so he'll blow it somehow and sure enough he gives out  his password yeah gave out his password oh we're laughing so hard we all have headaches now do you  do you get annoyed sometimes all because you have to watch the baby it's an all-day job do you kind 
[02:39:30]  of get annoyed if like you see him grabbing his golf bag in the morning um no it's that he  it's his entitlement that annoys me what do you mean what do you mean what what do you mean i mean  he's constantly like what i you know i gotta do this i do as much as you do i get to go golfing  why it's the only thing i get to do and it's just like this endless well because off out of his  mouth the thing is golfing is only a couple months out of the year you managed to do it a lot in the  winter yeah yeah honestly the thing is i don't mind you going golfing i really don't i think like

You got a couple of dumb haters on his VBAC, but in general, people are like, holy shit.  I've had a couple of dumb haters and did 150 arenas. 
[03:20:30]  It's okay.  People in general are going, holy shit, best song ever.  Oh, my God, where could I buy this?  We need an album release date.  That's a lot more hardcore.  That's sick talent for a 14-year-old.  Holy fuck, awesome.  It just keeps going and going.  It's a...  I don't know if you want...  All right, boss, I'll play you another time.  But what's the one you like?  Junkyard?  It was the first one you played.  I think it was Junkyard.  Junkyard.  Yeah.  I think it was Junkyard.  That's what they see as the single.  Junkyard, Rotten Core.  Yeah, we played all of them now. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  I'm taking this with me now.  Can't you just make a copy?  That's all I got on me.  No, it's mine now.  Oh, you can have a copy, but can't you make me a copy?  I need it for the shows.  What happened?  I got to go on to it.  I go on to it.  You go on to this now?  Yeah.  That's smart.  Yeah, I go on to Rotten Core.  But this is what I want to ask you, because, I mean, it's up to you.  This is something...  You got to understand, I'm on the phone.  I'm not even talking about my own career.  I'm talking with them now.  Dylan's supposed to be in bed, like, by 1130. 
[03:21:30]  One o'clock his time last night in L.A.  He's on the phone going, well, if we're going to do this with O&A,  they brought up a concept going, they got a lot of hits.  They got thousands of hits, of course, of this.  They got all kinds of messaging.  Great chicks.  I don't even understand this.  Like, 25, 30-year-old chicks.  What happened?  Coming on to them.  School kids.  It's the funniest thing.  That's what happens.  So, they want to do their first concert in New York this summer. 
[03:22:00]  Let's do it.  No, but this is what I'm asking you.  Beacon theater right away?  Not a beacon.  Not a beat.  More like a rock club, like...  Yeah, but we...  Yeah, you don't want to scare them a little bit.  No, small rock club.  Do the Rosenland.  Somebody brought up the Bowery something to me.  Bowery Ballroom?  Yeah.  That's kind of a big place, isn't it?  It's like three or four hundred seats standing.  Yeah, that's perfect.  Yeah.  Like, it would have to be a club that would give you guys all the tickets.  And you would have to do a little something, too. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, of course I do.  You would have to do a little something.  But it's their show.  It's their concert.  No, everyone will understand that.  Yeah.  But, you know, we build a little thing around it.  Would you want to do that?  Fuck yeah.  Can we do it in August?  That's what they're...  Because, you know, he's not in school.  He's on August 12th.  Why August 12th?  Why August 12th?  No, serious.  Early August, because I go away late August.  Early August.  We do a summer thing.  That could be cool.  Ooh.  Yeah.  So we have to...  If there's a club person who has one out there...  I don't know how to do this. 
[03:23:00]  That's not what I do.  You don't know how to promote?  No, what I'm saying is I know my thing, but I don't know how to ask...  I don't know the club guy.  Yeah.  Like the rock club.  Kenny knows that shit.  Kenny, ask your name for everybody.  Kenny!  Get in there.  Kenny!  Kenny!  Kenny!  Kenny!  Kenny, what's...  Oh, Bonnie's here, too.  Look at Bonnie.  He closes the door on Bonnie's face.  Bonnie!  She's got a baby, and he closes the door.  Oh, that's the baby.  Look how beautiful the baby is.  Holy mackerel!  Holy shit!  It's full grown.  It's full grown.  It's full grown.  It just keeps growing. 
[03:23:30]  Congratulations.  I haven't seen you since in the back of the...  Look how beautiful she is.  Thank you.  Baby's got bed head.  Hey, look how pretty you look.  Oh, wow.  Really?  We'll get back to you in a second.  Okay.  This is the baby's room.  I'm sorry.  I'm talking to the baby.  What can we do?  She could do an impression of you.  Ready?  Do it.  Do it at the end?  What's Daddy say?  No, they get all shy in front of me.  I know.  You put the mic in front of them, they just don't know.  Oh, yes.  If you ignore her, she'll start doing it. 
[03:24:00]  Hey, Rich, how do you not make out with that?  Because she's only two years old.  What's wrong with you?  You're disgusting.  Let's get the freaking, you know, romance back.  She looks hot too, Bob.  She looks really fucking good.  In the romance department?  No, she's looking hot too.  Because let me tell you, when I did meet her in the back of the comedy store with them,  I mean, that's all it was about.  It was making out, right?  We all remember that.  What do you like, Elvis? 
[03:24:30]  The minute you have a kid, you can't have sex?  Oh, it's not her fault.  No, you.  Oh.  Why would she be like Elvis?  Yeah.  Elvis had a thing, like when Priscilla had the baby, all of a sudden she's a mother.  Yeah.  You know, I won't talk dirty in front of the child.  But wouldn't do that.  No, no, that's all right.  The baby knows.  No, we have sex.  We had sex the other night.  So what's the problem?  There's nothing going on while you're having it?  They don't make out, Dice.  No, it's not.  The sex actually isn't really the problem.  It's everything else. 
[03:25:00]  I'm a little uncomfortable with the child listening.  It's everything else.  Wait, it's everything else?  Everything else, like daytime?  Yeah, like he's just an ass.  He's just a full-blown ass.  You know what?  You're a very nice girl and everything.  A full-blown ass.  But it's just funny to me, oh, that when I met them, she was all over him.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, married with the child, all of a sudden he's an ass.  He wasn't an ass.  No, he was always an ass.  Before there was no guarantee. 
[03:25:30]  Dice, can I call you that?  Yeah.  What happened?  Tell me.  I'm on your side.  Here's the thing.  One of the reasons that I liked Rich from the get-go is because he's an ass.  I like that about him.  I do.  So it's just that it's, since having a baby, it's like you kind of have to, you have to  help out.  You know what I mean?  I can't.  All right.  Let me straighten you out.  The baby's two years old.  That's number one.  Okay?  Um, Rich, what?  You know?  Oh, I didn't know the baby was two years old. 
[03:26:00]  Thank you, though, for straighting me out on that one.  I thought she was only 22 months.  20.  How many is that?  A year or something?  That's almost a year.  That's almost two years.  That's nearly a year, right?  All right.  Like almost two.  It's almost two.  Almost two, yeah.  Now I'm dying to hear the advice.  No, no.  This is the thing.  Yeah.  All right.  Because I've gone through the whole child thing.  Jesus.  You know what I mean?  I do that.  Yeah.  You know, I go and I have kids.  You seem like you're a great dad.  I am a great dad.  I've seen you on different shows. 
[03:26:30]  You know what I mean?  But the thing is this.  When they're first born, you know, there's really nothing for a father to do, you know, other  than errands.  Like you do the diapering.  You do the washing.  You do the feeding.  But your job is to go to the store and get all the diapers, all the water, crackers, nipples,  formula.  My wife had formula.  She was almost trapped in it.  There was so much around her. 
[03:27:00]  Just cases and cases.  Because guys don't do that.  You can't start in with, why don't you diaper the baby?  We're not paternal that way.  Right.  No, I'm not asking him to do that.  I'm asking him to open a door for me or help me load the car.  What?  Yes.  You've got to be right with a woman.  You've got to open the door.  Yes.  Rich is being a selfish woman.  Your wife does all these things for you.  Can't you do that for her?  If she just wants you to open the door.  You know.  If she burns your socks. 
[03:27:30]  Open the door now and tell her to get out of here.  We're on the end.  This is the main show.  I know.  I was thinking for a second, like, is this Opie and Anthony?  Like, are we really, like...  Rich, what's wrong with you?  Open a door.  Let's start there.  I open...  I'm fucking...  I'm...  Hi, baby.  You're the door opening wizard, you.  I do.  I do shit.  Exactly.  What's with the vulgarity in front of a child?  Yeah, what's up, man?  What is it? 
[03:28:00]  They don't pick on this?  Yeah, they pick up on it.  They pick up on it.  They try to teach her it.  I didn't curse till my kids could, you know...  That's true.  You teach them curse words and everything?  That's right.  I have to roll up the windows and lock the doors when I say other things.  What do you mean?  Oh.  You know, the good stuff.  These kids...  You see what I mean?  What?  I got two daughters.  They're 18 and 16.  My daughters are good kids.  I know how to parent.  I'm a good parent.  When that baby...  When Raina turns three and four, you don't think I'll be taking her to the park and doing  all that shit? 
[03:28:30]  No, but that's where you come in.  That's the kind of shit?  No, but that's...  Yes, that's when you come in.  You throw her into an amusement park.  You come into more play.  You go to the beach.  I do all that shit.  Yeah.  You know?  And then here.  I'm going out.  I got to do the club tonight.  Yeah.  You handle right to it here.  Well, sometimes we'll work together on the roster.  But you're also a comic, so you...  See, that's what's the hard part, because you both do the stand-up.  Bonnie's a really good comic.  Really.  It's great.  Thank you.  For real.  She's fucking working out, right?  Because we give the female comic a bad name on the show, but they give themselves bad 
[03:29:00]  names.  No, female comics have gone a long way, I'm telling you.  No, not really.  There's a few exceptions, like Bonnie's one of them.  All right, so that's what I mean.  She's just a comic.  I still think most of them suck.  I don't see her as a female, or I just see her as a comic.  I see all you can have sex with her if you don't see her as a female.  I knew that was coming.  I gotta retell that story about when we were watching that porno, and the chick was seeing  the guy's head.  What a dysfunctional family. 
[03:29:30]  And really coming from you.  You're sitting here with a little baby talking about watching pornos.  I don't get it.  Does she know what a porno is?  I don't know.  Look at the smile on her face.  Was she in the room at the time?  No.  Oh, I don't know.  So what happened?  You're watching a porno, and the girl's giving a hummer?  Yeah, and Rich goes, oh, isn't she lucky?  Isn't who lucky?  Oh, God.  You are a downer, man.  No, I don't know. 
[03:30:00]  I missed one part.  You're ruining my punchlines, guys.  Oh, I didn't know.  I didn't know.  All right, do it again.  Start it off.  I know.  Do it again.  Look how me and Anthony do it.  Watch.  One joke.  Go ahead.  Watch.  Go ahead.  Start a joke.  Jack be nimble.  Bump!  Perfect.  You don't have to even do the whole thing.  Okay, okay.  Okay, now do the joke.  Isn't she lucky?  What were you the news?  Oh, bump! 
[03:30:30]  Now it's mine.  Remember that one?  The baby has more credits than half the comics in this business.  She's done radio, television.  She is a doll.  Look how pretty she is.  She is.  She's beautiful.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I know.  Do you actually still go and do gigs, though?  Are you doing gigs?  Yeah, well, lots of times we do gigs together, and one of us watches the baby while the other  one performs.  Oh, here's something that another great thing about Rich. 
[03:31:00]  He gets tired of watching the baby, so he lets her go.  Let's her go?  What is he catching release?  Yeah, he just lets her, and she makes a beeline for the stage.  And we cry while I'm on, because she wants to see me.  Much to the relief of the audience.  That is not nice.  That's very mean.  That's your comeback?  That is not nice?  What are you, Link Copp?  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  Trash of no-chin meaty fuck.  I think he's just mad, because I said that chick. 
[03:31:30]  Has the baby really ever run up on stage?  Oh, many times.  Many times.  And what does the audience go, like, aw, do they do that?  Yeah, like, I'm in the middle of some horrible bits.  It doesn't wreck the flow or anything, right?  Yeah, no.  What are you trying to do up there?  No, it's not at all.  What has the period got to do with it?  Why not?  Why not?  Let me talk about that.  Yeah, I know.  There's children in the room.  Why shouldn't I?  All right.  I mean, Dice.  You don't like that, right?  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  She looks.  Yeah, we're going back to Kenny and Dice thing.  So, we get a club in early August. 
[03:32:00]  Wait, hold on.  We got the hard run.  We got the hard run.  When you're on or Voss is on, the baby runs up?  When I'm on.  Oh, I thought it was when Voss is on.  No, when Voss is on, she runs out of the room.  That's why you're mean.  Oh, that's why I said.  That's why I wasn't.  I couldn't come back, because I'm not used to it.  Much to the relief of the audience.  I thought it was when you were on stage, the baby would run up.  No, it's not Bonnie's on.  Oh, okay.  No, she didn't.  I didn't.  I was trashing Voss, not Bonnie.  Well, you inadvertently had some collateral damage there, and I think she owes her an apology.  Aren't I hurting enough? 
[03:32:30]  Isn't there enough pain in Bonnie's life?  Kenny, we need a club for Dice's kids' band.  Yeah, a rock club.  You know a lot of them?  Early August.  No, serious.  Yeah, we got Crocodile Rocks in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  No, but he means in New York.  That's crazy.  Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Yes.  What about Hard Rock Johnny?  Asked uncomfortable penis bulging his pants.  Oh, my God. 
[03:33:00]  Kenny's all bagged.  He really is.  It's like an acorn on a beanbag chair.  What about the Hard Rock Cafe?  500 seats.  500 seats?  They want like a real rock club.  Like a, you know, standing only.  Some grime.  They're looking for grime.  A little dirt.  Hard Rock doesn't have seats.  Do you know the Bowery Club?  Downtown, no.  But we'll find out.  A place that you'd like, like something that would have been like CBGBs or something. 
[03:33:30]  So, they got to call in to O&A if there's a club.  Number one, they got to give you all the tickets so you can give them to the fans that want to come see them.  That club we did, the Lou Wallach Roast.  What was that called?  That would be perfect.  That's a comedy club.  No, no.  It was a rock down in the downtown, the Lower East Side.  What's the name of it?  And has it got a real rock vibe?  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck?  Remember where we did the roast that time?  I don't know what it's called.  Can we play Super's Life?  Can we play Junkyard?  No.  You can't?  Okay. 
[03:34:00]  Okay.  No, can we?  Can't we?  Yeah, we can.  And you'll make me a copy of it?  No.  This is my copy.  I really need.  No.  You can have that copy?  Yes.  But I need a copy.  I now control your son's band.  No, this is what.  You've got to be nice with your daughter, Bonnie.  I think you met one of my kids when you were in L.A.  He was like 11 at the time.  I don't think so.  Yeah, because he goes there a lot with me.  And I remember, you just don't remember, but this is their band.  It's just the two of them.  14 years old.  Yeah, he's, uh, my youngest son, Dylan's 14. 
[03:34:30]  He writes and plays guitar, all the songs, and Max is 18, and he drums.  Oh, wow.  So this is, uh, the song Junkyard that, you know, that, anyway.  Looking at your past time, rusted and decayed, barking from the guy down, makes you go. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, insane.  Oh, insane.  If you picked up a scrap, would it make you choke? 
[03:35:30]  Down in the junkyard where the dead things lay.  Down in the junkyard where the dead things lay.  Here at the playground you could never escape.  This is your final day.  Oh, yeah.  Soaking in the carnage 
[03:36:00]  Breathing in the smoke  Looking at destruction  Like it's one big fucking joke  If you picked up the scrap 
[03:36:30]  Would it make you choke?  Down in the junkyard  Where the dead things lay  Down in the junkyard  Where the dead things lay  Here at the playground  You could never escape  This is your final day  This is your final day 
[03:37:00]  This is your final day  This is your final day  This is your final day  This is your final day  Snooking in the shadows 
[03:37:30]  Peering through the holes  Looking at his kingdom  Looking at his kingdom  This is all that he knows  If you picked up the scrap 
[03:38:00]  Would it make you choke?  Down in the junkyard  Where the dead things lay  Down in the junkyard  Where the dead things lay  Here at the playground  You could never escape  This is your final day  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  We'll be right back. 
[03:38:30]  Amazing, yeah. 
[03:39:00]  14 years old.  That's great.  That's the one I really like, Junkyard.  No, Junkyard's great.  Two and five.  I really like that one.  They're two and five years old.  It's amazing.  So we'll find the club, right?  Madonna Mike just texted me.  Who?  Madonna Mike texted me.  Webster Hall, Irving Plaza.  Mercury Lounge is a good place.  Bowery Ballroom.  Bowery Ballroom.  Let's not forget about Hard Rock.  So it's one of them that got it off.  Hard Rock is too.  They give you all the tickets, right?  It needs some grime, right?  Yeah, a little more grime.  We need a little grime.  We need a little puke on the walls. 
[03:39:30]  Well, that's what I heard about the Bowery place.  But also, for any, they're going to audition bass players.  You know, this is all done, just the two of them.  So they need a bass player.  You know, between...  L.A. based, of course.  Between 14...  And they need a mommy that's cool to, you know, bring them to band practice.  But no, it could be between 14 and 21.  A girl.  And they got to send to the...  Go younger.  There's some kids out there that could rip it up that are younger than 21.  All right.  Well, let me...  Keep the band going. 
[03:40:00]  Sounds like the rules to my house.  Let me have to say to MySpace.  Look, if I'm going to control this band, you got to listen to it.  All right, but we got to say, what they said is to send...  I didn't even know this could happen.  Yeah.  Like, they could actually send a video to their MySpace of one song, of them playing one song.  Well, you don't know people could actually send videos.  With information.  They take away on the platter here, and it goes through the computer thing.  I don't know.  I just got to do this.  Let me just say this.  So they're... 
[03:40:30]  Now you know how we feel, by the way.  So what do I say?  I start it the way he wrote it.  MySpace.com slash official L.A. Rocks, and for bass players in California, like, you know,  in Hollywood type of area, to send a video playing one song with information how to get  in touch with them.  So it's MySpace.com slash official L.A. Rocks.  L.A.  That's the song.  You got to put those words. 
[03:41:00]  One word, official L.A. Rocks on MySpace.  Simple as that.  Yeah, don't try to give out an address, Rich, after what you did today.  Don't worry, Dice.  Give away sensitive CIA secrets.  Dice, our listeners are good with the platter.  Don't worry.  They'll find it.  They'll find it.  Official L.A. Rocks on MySpace.  Well, he lays under when a girl shits.  No, so, all right.  Can I read instant feedback?  Puddle of AIDS writes, Opie, try not to berate Dice on stage when Max is playing and cause  a seven-year fight that you won't find out until seven years later. 
[03:41:30]  Wow.  Was it seven years?  Yeah.  I found out that you hated me seven years later.  Jesus.  It wasn't seven.  Yeah, we're very limited now because Ron and Feds come on at 11 o'clock now.  Computers will cut us off.  Are we going to find a club?  Yeah, they do because we have a show starting at 11.  Let's get the plugs out.  The show comes in here now at 11 o'clock instead of at noon.  So we got to clear the fuck out.  10.43.  The computers will just cut us off.  It's a replay.  Like right now because they've got to move equipment in and shit. 
[03:42:00]  Jesus.  You got the plugs.  It's going to be an EAS test that's going to drive everyone nuts.  Let them run that shit through a dumb promo for a dumb person.  Thank you.  If you know what I mean.  All right.  And this is done through the platter?  Yes.  Right through the platter.  We got it.  Rich Voss this Friday, Saturday at Uncle Vinny's in Point Pleasant.  That's this weekend.  And then May 28th, 30th, Captain Brian's at Marco Island in Florida.  It's with Levy and Florentine and Voss.  Hold on real quick.  And Bonnie, June 19th and 20th.  Catch a rising star in Princeton. 
[03:42:30]  All right.  And where am I?  She's also looking for a good divorce lawyer.  What's the 21st?  The 21st is what day?  That's tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow.  I'll be the good one, Opie.  There's nothing to take.  Tarrytown Music Hall in Tarrytown, New York.  And then May 23rd, which is Saturday, Turning Stone Casino.  It's in Verona.  And for more, just go to andrewdiceclay.com.  Let's see all the gig I'm doing.  I don't know.  There's only two.  They're going to have to go to andrewdiceclay.com.  Fucking publicist.  And this Saturday, I'll be in L.A. doing...  That was stupid.  Oh, Dice, you said the cursing thing.  What do you mean? 
[03:43:00]  I'll be doing the...  I'm sorry.  I'll be in Los Angeles.  What am I going to say?  Santa Monica doing the benefit at Adam Carolla's house with Leno for Tom Hanks' charity.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  I am.  I can't find a fucking flight to L.A., so I can't go to that.  When's the benefit?  Give me a flight, Dice.  To where?  L.A.  L.A.  Cool.  What's it for?  Some Tom Hanks charity.  Private jet.  Me and you.  Well, not private jet, but...  Why?  Let's make believe it's like what?  You do this.  Oh, you're just going to say 1988 or something like that.  So early August, you're telling me... 
[03:43:30]  I got to know.  She's been pointing it out, Ant.  I thought I was safe, you asked.  I saw me you were going.  You're a fucking idiot.  Will you go for eggs again?  You can't save me?  Save me over here.  What?  Will you go for eggs again?  Are you doing something?  No.  I don't need to do that again.  One time...  What?  One time was exhausting.  For some breakfast.  It's exhausting hanging out with him.  A bagel or something?  Maybe a bagel.  Some juice?  A bagel.  Maybe a bagel.  We have a meeting, too.  Oh, yeah.  I got to meet with Rich and Bonnie.  All right.  I'm controlling them now, too.  Okay.  I got your kids banned, and I'm controlling them now.  And they need a bassist, but the guy has got to be good and have some personality. 
[03:44:00]  And you've got to be over 40 years old.  Tell them, Norton.  You do it.  Tell them that it's 40 and above.  You've got to be around L.A.  MySpace.com slash Official L.A. Rocks.  That's the page.  You need to have a drug problem, right?  Yes.  You have to.  I've been at least three rehabs, 40 and up.  Between the ages of 14 and 21, be good.  Send a video of yourself playing bass.  They're going to cut us off very shortly.  Oh, no one wants to see that.  Oh, I'm just scratching my butt.  You know, I can't see anything.  A kid can see. 
[03:44:30]  A buddy can see.  Why?  If he said you were funny, you'd have to look at it.  Hey, let me fly into Burbank.  That's what I do.  You should fly into Burbank.  Give me a flight to Burbank.  Why are you looking to go to L.A.?  To see Jimmy and Tom Hanks and fucking Jay Leno.  No, I'm doing a benefit Saturday.  Where's it at?  Adam Carolla's house.  Do you have land?  In his house?  I have land, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Why are you looking at Carolla?  He just has to learn to talk faster.  Are you doing any condo gigs coming up?  Too slow to it. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  What?  What happened?  And every time I do his show, it's the same questions.  Really?  Yeah.  It's hysterical.  And I answer it the same way.  Like he never answers.  I like watching.  I'll do his show when I go back there.  Shut up.  Dice is talking.  Who?  Nothing on that?  Shut up.  No.  That's not me.  It's the baby.  I know.  He's making a joke.  That was a joke.  I do try jokes.  That was you.  Sorry, I try a joke every once in a while.  Fucker.  Did you get your hair cut for your birthday party? 
[03:45:30]  You having a little party?  You got your hair cut?  You going to get a donkey?  Hey, man, you got to keep it shorter when you start losing a little bit.  A what?  A donkey?  A donkey.  What's a donkey?  That's a donkey.  That's a mule-like animal that you put in your coffee.  A donkey.  Oh, the wheels are falling off.  It's my favorite radio, though.  So when are you going to stay on until the computer goes off?  I don't even know if we're on.  And I'm being completely honest.  I don't know if we're done or not.  I don't know.  That's why I'm not into these.  We're on a fez. 
[03:46:00]  People have to come in.  Bye, guys.  So what happens if you actually leave them?  Yeah, I'm going to leave.  I'm actually going to look at the baby.  Say bye-bye.  Ant secretly likes babies.  He doesn't want to admit it on the air, though.  Look.  He's doing a little coochie-coo.  Do a coochie-coo, Ant.  I don't care if you keep that, but I need a coffee.  No.  I now control the band.  I'm sorry.  No.  No.  I need it to go on stage.  No.  It's mine.  The only one I got was mine.  Just have your guy run a copy.  No.  That's a cool cover.  I almost... 
[03:46:30]  Hey, I just didn't know that.  Can you make a...  Rich, I can almost see that on your wife's shirt.  Wow, Ant's looking down Bonnie's shirt.  I can almost see that on your wife's shirt.  How's it look, Ant?  I was going to look.  How does it look?  I was going to look.  It looks pretty good.  Yeah, yeah.  Rich, take care of Bonnie, will you?  I take care of him.  I try.  No, take care of him.  A little askew, so it's, you know...  No, but we've got to make it.  Do that in Photoshop.  Rich, you know who would be perfect.  Like we're talking?  We're still on the air, so don't give away any secrets to our secret project.  Now a nice one. 
[03:47:00]  We'll go.  Shh.  Rich, we're still on the air.  Oh.  Me and you, bro.  When are we playing golf?  This was a fun Tuesday we're going to play.  What?  We need a place to play golf on Tuesday, me and Rich Voss.  Somewhere close.  We don't want a five, six hour round.  We want to get out.  Quick and easy.  Free carts, free golf, and possibly a free golf lesson.  That's what we're looking for for Tuesday, me and Rich Voss.  We want to play either Plainfield Country Club or Bolterstroll, which I couldn't make happen. 
[03:47:30]  Just somewhere nice.  Oh, you want real nice?  I just put a plug out there.  We can get on Bolterstroll or Plainfield Country Club, two of the nicest courses in the country.  No pictures.  Just the pictures.  No, because it's my...  No.  It's a fleece.  One picture.  You look good.  It's a t-shirt.  All right.  You can't stand it, but somebody might come in.  Can I...  Can you come in?  Is that a good pose?  No, just be more like that.  Just like that.  You look good like that.  What are you doing with this picture?  Do a pose.  Was that good?  What can I do with this?  That was like... 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, nice, right?  What?  Nice, right?  One more.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  Kids grabbing Bonnie's tit.  What?  Yeah, just grabbed your tit.  I almost said that to me.  That was wrong, man.  What happened?  I figured we'd go to the end of this dumb music bell.  She's funnier than ever, man.  Look at her glasses.  I like the glasses.  The sunglasses. 
[03:48:30]  Bring it together.  I know.  She looks like fucking...  She should be on that show, New Jersey Housewives.  Yes.  See?  Except then you can see us going into our tiny condo.  Yeah.  Tiny.  I drive out the porch, yeah.  Sam, what do you got?  What?  What?  All right, that's it.  See you tomorrow.  Bye-bye. </pre>
