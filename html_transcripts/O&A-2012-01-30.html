<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of reality television, specifically *Jersey Shore*, its unexpected success, Vinny's return, and the show's reliance on catchphrases and MTV's control over cast finances.  This transitioned into a segment focused on Demi Moore's alleged salvia incident, including played audio clips of a man's extreme reaction to the substance. The hosts criticized entertainment news for excessive teasing and lack of content.  They then skewered the SAG Awards, mocking various celebrities' appearances and behaviors, including Kristen Wiig's Kris Jenner impression and Mary Tyler Moore's award acceptance.  The discussion continued with a critique of the manufactured drama in shows like *Hardcore Pawn*, *Lizard Lick Towing*, and *Bait Car*, and a cynical analysis of the Kardashians, particularly Kim's perceived staged emotional breakdown and Khloe's supposedly undesirable radio show time slot.  The segment ended with a comment about the rotating photo in the radio station's lobby and a song from Dave's recurring segment.

The show continued with a highly profane, repetitive rant against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.  Eastside Dave's videos were promoted, and the hosts discussed podcast scheduling difficulties with Bill Burr.  A musical interlude, featuring a co-host ("E-Rock" or "Sexy") playing an obscure song, followed, with Joe DeRosa joining the hosts in a humorous, frustrating attempt to guess its relevance.  The discussion meandered through jokes about sneakers, shoes, and the Shoe Bomber, Richard Reid.  The conversation shifted to graphic descriptions of bullfighting, Hemingway's romanticization of it, and whether bull meat is consumed. A listener's comment about daylight savings time being a conspiracy to sell antidepressants led to a discussion of SAD, with Joe DeRosa claiming to suffer from it, Dr. Steve offering a brief explanation and suggesting light therapy, and Bill Burr briefly calling in to participate in ribbing Joe DeRosa about his alleged winter depression.

The next segment featured a continuation of the antagonistic banter between the hosts and Joe DeRosa, with Bill Burr discussing his "redneck tour" and jokes about global warming.  The conversation shifted to Kobe Bryant's divorce settlement and Bill Burr's new classic Ford pickup truck, leading to further jokes and insults.  A Super Bowl prediction ensued, with surprisingly coherent sports commentary from Joe DeRosa and a debate about the Patriots and the Jets.  The segment concluded with a wager: Joe DeRosa performing 20 push-ups on camera for $300, after initially resisting.

A lengthy argument about Joe DeRosa's push-up bet followed.  Mars' inconsistent judging of the push-ups (first requiring near-floor chest contact, then a 90-degree elbow bend), causing DeRosa, Bill Burr, and Steve to lose money, led to a chaotic series of side bets and accusations.  Kenny's attempt to objectively judge added to the humorous chaos.  The argument culminated in a decision to post a video of DeRosa's push-ups online for listener judgment, with Opie eventually returning DeRosa's $100.  Further playful banter and side bets on jumping jacks concluded the segment.

Finally, a commercial for Steven Singer's 24-karat gold-dipped roses, available in various colors and offered with free shipping and a personalized message, concluded the show.  The website IHateStevenSinger.com was promoted.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  But remember we had Vinny in here?  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  But I thought.  He was gone two episodes, which means probably eight hours of filming.  A couple hours, yeah.  Then they went and got him, I guess.  What happened?  They went and got Vinny.  They went and got our pal and said, come on, snap out of it.  We got some broads to bang.  Right.  And some drinks to drink.  And was it a big homecoming?  Was it all cuddly and nice?  Or was there a big fight?  The final scene of that episode was them driving back to the Jersey Shore.  Getting ready for another night at Karma. 
[00:05:00]  From where?  Staten Island?  Yeah, Staten Island.  Oh, boy.  Staten Island to Jersey Shore?  Wow.  That's a long ride.  What a big road trip they did, huh?  Are we too old for Jersey Shore?  What do you mean?  For the show or for the actual Jersey Shore?  Oh, no.  I'm going to go down there this summer.  Just places for older guys.  I don't know, man.  It's one of my thoughts from the weekend.  I was thinking about the Jersey Shore because I think we got Snooki and JWoww coming in this week.  Oh, boy. 
[00:05:30]  Because I think they got a little spinoff show going.  Oh, boy.  And I don't really understand why this show became so fucking big.  Although when I first saw it on MTV, I was like, holy shit, this show's cool.  But it's lasted.  I don't know why either.  Some things just click.  I don't know.  You can't tell.  They hang around, they drink, they go to Karma, they pick up broads, they sort of show  them making out, then they call cabs, and then they start over. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, no.  And then they kind of do that GTL thing.  And that's it.  Right.  And the show is massively huge.  Yeah.  And now they can't even really film it properly because they're all really famous.  So it's all close-up shots.  And then when they go into Karma, they only have their own little area now.  Yeah, yeah.  Because there's so many people.  It used to be they would wander around the club and stuff.  Because no one knew who they were.  Right.  Now everyone knows who they were.  So they got to push everybody back.  Sometimes in the background, you can see a line where all the people are kind of watching 
[00:06:30]  from.  Well, now they got to blur out the entire background.  Yeah.  Whenever they're walking around.  Yeah.  Because that's all looky-loos.  Looky-loos.  Thank you.  Looky-loos.  I love that term.  And I almost forgot.  It's still fucking early.  The looky-loos.  Sam's saying the show is huge because of catchphrases.  Oh, yeah.  Then why the fuck am I not famous?  Oh.  I should be really famous.  Your catchphrases are no good.  I like my catchphrases.  If you watch some of the scenes where they're in the shirt store, they're selling shirts and pressing 
[00:07:00]  it, if you look in the far back, their catchphrases are on the shirts.  Yeah.  You could make a shirt with their catchphrases.  Oh, boy.  Really?  I don't know if I'm really mocking them because, you know, good for them.  But I guarantee MTV, you know, kept them down so they're not making a lot of money from  MTV.  Oh, yeah.  You can't let them get too independent.  No.  Side projects, though.  I'm sure some of them are making some big bucks now.  I bet MTV shares in that, too.  But Vinny's back.  He's back.  Well, thank goodness.  Yeah.  We teased him and said, wow, you know, you left the Jersey Shorehouse. 
[00:07:30]  For how long?  How long?  And he's like, come on, bro.  Don't blow up my spot.  Spot blown.  Spot blown.  Well, no, the episode ran already.  So they ran to Staten Island and grabbed him and brought him back to the Jersey Shore.  Thank God.  He's all better.  Yeah.  Well, no, he says it's a work in progress.  Oh, OK.  It's going to take time.  Yeah.  But he understands that.  But he had enough time away from the house, a few hours back in Staten Island.  Well, there's some broads to bang. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, boy.  What's going to happen to these broads if you don't bang them?  Well, that's true.  So.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  How was your weekend?  Ah, pretty relaxing.  Yeah.  Ah, keep up on the, you know, entertainment news and whatnot.  The, uh, the Demi calls, you know.  Oh, wow.  Getting a little more in-depth into that thing.  She was smoking, um.  I think it must have been fucking salvia.  Salvia?  I think, uh.  Smoking salvia!  Which Joe Rogan told us all about years ago. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  The salvia.  It sounds like that, right?  Yeah.  So she was just, uh, having a pretty good trip.  Yeah, she was, like, shaking.  You ever see some, you've seen plenty of videos on YouTube of people on salvia, and they're  doing the same thing.  They're, like, shaking, oh, they're sweating.  Right.  And then, you know, give them a few minutes and they're okay.  But, uh, I guess somebody freaked out.  I think she's partying with the wrong people.  There are panicky Pete's in that house.  Bunch of panicky Pete's.  Let her have her trip, man!  Fuck, the second her eyes went back in her head, they're calling 911?  Right.  Come on. 
[00:09:00]  How about you give it a little time?  Yeah, see what happens.  See, this is the real news.  These dumb entertainment programs aren't going to tell you this.  There was no real seizure going on.  Demi Moore was having a good trip.  She was having a good one.  She had panicky Pete's fucking calling 911 and everybody else.  Her eyelids fluttering.  Right.  Her breathing was a little fucked up.  And her eyes rolled back in her head.  What else are you going to do?  Looks like she's into some stuff.  This is a horrible salvia trip right here, Sam.  What is it?  The crowd out says.  What is it?  He just did a hit, this guy.  Yeah.  Or is it?  He's going back.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, his heart's freaking.  Oh, shit.  He's freaking?  Not yet.  Yeah.  That guy's so high.  Holy shit.  He's looking at his hands and losing his mind. 
[00:10:00]  He's screaming.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  He's doing the homer scream.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Look out, Joe.  Uh-oh.  He's losing it. 
[00:10:30]  Joe, look out.  They're fucking with him.  The ceiling.  He thinks the ceiling's coming down.  The ceiling, Joe.  His arms are up.  He's fucked up.  Sit down, Joe.  He's trying to hold up the ceiling.  Sit down.  He's good now.  He's good.  He's good.  He's coming back down.  He's going to be all right now.  Joe is fucking hammered over there, man. 
[00:11:00]  He's fucking high, high.  What is it like?  Well, it's...  See, you guys, when you say something, you have to say it twice. 
[00:11:30]  I can't hear it.  I can't hear it.  I can't hear it.  I can't hear it.  I can't hear it.  You know what I mean?  His arms are still up, though.  I can't move me.  He's breathing heavy.  I can't move me.  He can't communicate at all.  No.  He was just screaming.  That's hilarious.  Ah!  What are you looking at, Joe?  And then you have your friends fucking with you like that.  Jesus.  The ceiling!  Yeah, the ceiling.  He winces when he looked up. 
[00:12:00]  He's giving me some kind of hand signal.  Yeah, I think he's gone.  Yeah, man.  I mean, this...  Ah!  Oh, no.  Wait.  Okay.  Another scream.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  What? 
[00:12:30]  What the fuck?  I'm going to kill you.  Whoever's giving me fucking this shit.  Fuck you.  Are you guys laughing at me?  No, we were laughing with you.  You were just laughing.  No, what are you guys?  No.  What are you guys doing? 
[00:13:00]  My face.  I'm just waking up somewhere.  He's coming back now.  Oh, he's coming back.  He's fucking me up, dude.  What the fuck did you guys do to me?  He can't stand up.  What?  Holy shit.  Sit down, don't you?  Stop him with the camera.  Stop.  Holy shit.  That guy was tooled. 
[00:13:30]  Well, see how long it lasts?  That was about four.  That was pretty much it.  About four minutes.  Yeah.  Looked like Demi Moore was having one of those.  Yeah.  And then one panicked in the house.  Panicky Pete's called 911.  Looks like she's into some stuff, though.  Yeah.  Whippets, possibly some salvia.  Something.  One of the craziest things about the Demi 911 call is not even the fact that she's convulsing  and everything.  It's that they called 911.  Do we have the 911 call?  I'm sure it's somewhere. 
[00:14:00]  It's long.  Yeah, it is long.  How long is it?  Ten minutes.  I'll see if they can cut it up.  They call and say, hey, we got an emergency here.  They give the address, which is bleeped out in the call, but they give the address.  And then the 911 operator goes, oh, wait, I don't think that's us.  I think we got to give you over to another township.  And then they have to get in touch with that.  It's like, wait a minute.  I'm calling 911.  Can you just like fucking send somebody?  Yeah, you figure that shit out.  And then it's like, they ask the same questions and then get mad when you're like, hey, it's 
[00:14:30]  an emergency.  Could you send somebody over?  Right.  It's like, excuse me.  I'm trying to get a car over to you.  Nah.  You're just freaking out.  But maybe they already sent something.  Maybe.  Sent the police.  I don't know.  The fire.  The ambulance.  They sure don't have a good phone side manner.  No, I know.  When it's a real emergency.  When it's bullshit, they should just goof on the people and hang up.  But I think as soon as you make that call, they're on their way already.  And now they're just trying to get some info. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  They were like, oh, there's a gate down at the bottom of the road.  We'll give you the code.  And they're like, no, could you send someone down?  Right.  Like, obviously, you send someone down to the gate to open the gate and then wave the fucking EMS  guys in.  Where's Demi at today?  Back home?  Last I heard, she was getting some, you know, treatment.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Rehab action?  Yeah.  There's probably going to be some of that in her future.  What she was doing, you know. 
[00:15:30]  And what about the Whippet story?  Did that, is that, that's the real deal, right?  I heard that they were saying that some people had to take the whole Whippet thing off their  sites because it wasn't really in the tape.  But then the 911 people say it was, but they took it out.  Right.  I don't know.  Well, they don't want to get sued.  Well.  She's doing something.  Ashton, what, had to come running back to L.A.?  Did he?  For what?  I don't know.  They're busted up.  I know.  He's probably feeling a little guilty.  Feeling a little guilty that he's banging some fucking young broad and his old, old 
[00:16:00]  chick is doing salvia, perhaps?  God, you broads, man.  You know how to bring us back.  Oh, my God.  Bring us back into the fold.  Oh, my God.  But I thought we were broken up.  Yeah.  No, I think he rushed back to L.A.  Did you see that on the cover of a Star magazine or something?  It's like, Ashton rushes back to Demi's bedside.  And they got like, they don't have any pictures of now.  So they take a picture of Demi, like maybe from one of our movies where she's in a bed. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of looking freaked out.  And then they take Ashton looking concerned.  Right.  And they put the pictures together.  Right.  And then all the house frowls go, oh.  Of course.  Oh, I got to get this.  You know, because of the Demi Moore story, I watched, I don't know, they're all the same  program, but I'm not sure if it was Entertainment Tonight, All Access Hollywood.  It was one of them.  And what a fucking wasted time those shows are.  Because everyone knows everything already.  Sam knows.  Sam knows.  Yeah.  They just repeat themselves for half an hour.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable. 
[00:17:00]  They're in some weird loop that they can't get out of.  And it's all teases for stories that are as long as the tease.  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're thinking they think a story's going to come up.  It's exhausting, though, to watch.  It really is.  Because they continually tease stuff and almost give you the info.  And then they start teasing the same story again.  And there's all these, like, parallel universes going on for the half hour.  And the story is just a blurb.  Yeah.  It's nothing.  If you cut the fat out of those fucking entertainment shows, the substance, I don't know, it might 
[00:17:30]  be, let me think, half hour show, it might be three minutes of information they're giving  you.  And then teases.  And then they just fucking tease the shit out of it.  I was exhausted.  I was like, holy shit, will you just fucking, fucking give the news?  What's the story?  What's the latest on this broad?  In a video transition, like every 30 seconds, it's whoosh, whoosh.  And then we're going back out to the Grove.  Mario Lopez is talking, ah, we're going back, and then when we come back, it's going to  be an interview.  Now, I understand when you're trying to hold an audience, teasing something is important. 
[00:18:00]  Sure, we do it here.  But they've got it to a point where I don't see how anyone on a regular basis is enjoying  that.  It's a show of teases.  It's a show full of teases and then an occasional blurb with a half story.  I don't know if we could do it justice, but we should maybe cut up the Demi Moore half  hour on Entertainment Tonight just to show you.  See how they covered it.  Holy fuck.  And when we return, those 911 calls, but then they'll give you like 10 seconds, like the 
[00:18:30]  hello part, and then later on, we'll give you more of this.  But then I don't even know if they actually give you anything more.  No, you never get the full thing.  No.  Ever.  Right?  They always keep you wanting more.  I found myself yelling at the TV.  They go like, coming up after this, Demi Moore is back in treatment, we'll tell you about  it.  And then they come back and they say, Demi Moore back in treatment.  Tell us about it, Mario.  Well, Demi Moore is back in treatment.  Well, we're going to be joining some people that know Demi, knew her throughout the years. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  Well, she is.  And she's back in treatment.  Oh, God.  Yes.  Yes.  It's unbelievable.  Just over and over and over again.  Unwatchable.  And just the plain fact that anything that's on there, you can get online well before they're  putting it on.  But I guess there's still, you know, a lot of dummies out there that don't have dummies  and old people that don't know how to use their phones properly because they're still  getting big audiences for these entertainment shows. 
[00:19:30]  Yep.  And Billy Bush is just a schmuck.  Oh, he stinks.  He's the worst guy on TV.  He stinks.  They all stink.  They all want to be Ryan Seacrest so bad.  Like Billy Bush wishes he had some of that Ryan Seacrest juice.  Some of that charisma.  Who's the pan-faced broad on E?  Juliana Rancic.  Oh.  Who was she fucking for a while?  The guy.  Well, she's married to one of the.  The apprentice.  One of the apprentice guys.  Rancic.  Bill Rancic.  Whoa.  She stinks. 
[00:20:00]  She was on the red carpet for those dumb SAG awards last night and I decided to watch  that.  I saw a few seconds of that.  Did you see?  Before I just didn't discuss.  Kristen Wiig was being interviewed.  Funny broad.  And pan-faced.  I call it pan-faced because when she turns sideways, holy fuck.  It's a straight line.  Nothing there.  Nothing there.  She asked Kristen Wiig to do her Kris Jenner impression.  Oh, yeah.  Which I guess is all the rage these days.  And basically what Kristen Wiig does is just walks past the camera with these fucking weird 
[00:20:30]  eyes and then goes off camera.  That's all the impression is.  But it's pretty fucking funny.  And it definitely captures what Kris Jenner's all about.  So pan-faced goes, hey, could you do your Kris Jenner?  So Kristen Wiig does it.  And if you're going to make fun of someone, fucking own it.  Yeah.  Because all of a sudden pan-faced goes after it's, you know, it got a huge laugh, goes,  oh, but Chris, you know we love you and blah, blah, blah.  It's like, just fucking own it. 
[00:21:00]  You're making fun of her for being a fucking, you know, dunce or whatever.  You gotta add the apology in because, you know, she might be the next person up on the  carpet.  And then what are you going to do?  Awkward moment.  It drove me nuts.  Because it's like, if you're going down that road, you don't have to always end it with,  but you know we love you.  You know this.  You know that.  Then don't do it.  Show upset Seacrest.  You watched the SAG Awards at all?  Did you see the Mary Tyler Moore thing?  No.  I watched a little bit of the red carpet. 
[00:21:30]  And then I had it.  Oh, here's the Kristen Wiig thing.  Oh, okay.  And you gotta get the Mary Tyler Moore because it was kind of, I was even uncomfortable because  they were giving her a Lifetime Achievement Award because she's going to be pretty much  dead in the next few months.  Oh, man.  I'm surprised she even showed up there.  Really bad.  And her speech was over, but no one knew it.  And she just kind of stood there.  And everyone's just looking at her.  And she's just kind of looking.  And then Dick Van Dyke had to kind of be the gentleman to come over and like, oh, Mary, 
[00:22:00]  we all love you.  Oh, yeah.  You gotta find that, too.  Whoa.  What is she fucking?  It could be the first time that I can remember in a long time that I was uncomfortable for  somebody.  Why was she just standing there?  Well, I mean, she's got some major health issues.  She's had brain tumors.  At least one brain tumor.  Oh, really?  And she's 75 and we were giving her a Lifetime Achievement Award.  Dick Van Dyke had to help her?  He's like 100 years old.  Well, someone on Twitter said he looks like Gary Busey from the future. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, boy.  But he's hanging in there, too.  Oh, man.  Well, Mary Tyler Moore was accepting her Lifetime Achievement Award and she's thrown in her  catchphrases and stuff.  Oh, no.  I guess I've made it after all.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Did you find the Kristen Wiig?  I have it, yeah.  Yeah.  Watch the, oh, my God, we just made fun of someone.  We gotta make sure everyone's okay with this.  I hate this.  Fucking own it and just go with it.  By the way, wait. 
[00:23:00]  We gotta talk about something immediately.  Your impression of Kris Jenner, who I love, by the way.  You know, she's huge.  Johnny.  You see Panface when she turns sideways?  Can you pretend you're Kris Jenner and you're anchoring on the red carpet?  And, like, maybe you're welcoming everyone back to the e-burn party.  This was amazing TV, by the way.  I think the camera should be on you.  No!  And then I'll do my impression of Kris Jenner.  Oh, okay.  So what are we doing?  Say it on her.  Okay.  Hey, everybody.  Welcome back.  We are live on the red carpet at the SAG Awards and Kris Jenner is joining us now. 
[00:23:30]  And they didn't even get the right camera.  We love you, Kris!  She's supposed to just come in front of the camera.  They didn't even know how to do it.  No.  The version I saw was a different camera angle.  That's really weird.  But anyway, go back slightly, because she has to make sure Kris Jenner's okay with the teasing they just did.  We love you, Kris!  Thank you, Kris.  And we're huge fans.  Thank you so much.  And she said it again.  The women and men love you, too.  Thanks for making us laugh, everybody. 
[00:24:00]  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Thank you so much.  Bye, sweetheart.  Oh, God.  But she has to say it, like, twice.  Oh, we love you, Kris.  We love you, Kris.  Don't take it seriously.  We're just trying to have fun over here.  Oh, my God.  But we're so scared you might fire us.  So you're okay with this, right?  Oh, this is the Mary Tyler Moore, um...  Uh, it was the Lifetime Achievement Award.  Lifetime Achievement Award.  And damn it, you know what?  I watched a little bit.  This fucking Betty White.  Yeah.  90 years old. 
[00:24:30]  She won.  Yeah.  And she gets up there, and she's fucking just fucking winging it.  Yeah.  And the fraud at 90 is still goddamn funny.  And fucking Mary Tyler Moore is falling apart.  What happens?  At 75.  What happens?  Uh, at 75.  Yeah, she's, uh...  She's right with the montages.  Let's get a fucking clip of her on stage.  What's going on here?  You don't have the clip of her on stage?  Wow, the internet's slacking today.  Here it is.  Okay.  Let's see.  Oh, boy.  There's no audio on my end. 
[00:25:00]  What happened?  There's no audio.  Oh, this is one of those.  They want you to go to the website.  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  Assholes.  Come on.  Wait.  They want you to go to the website for someone else's material?  Yes.  They steal the material.  That's crazy.  It's a lot of fun when your material gets stolen.  I guess we don't have it.  Huh?  I guess we don't have Mary Tyler Moore's speech.  We'll find it.  It sucks.  This guy's way behind.  The Inquirer says that O.J. Simpson may be Khloe Kardashian's father. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, stop it.  What is this, our entertainment segment?  What the fuck?  That was about a week, a week and a half ago.  Yeah, where you been?  Now Khloe Kardashian's father is some hairdresser in Hollywood.  Yeah.  And they did the side-by-side with this guy and her?  Oh, my God.  Big monster heads.  I think we got a match.  Yep.  They both have big monster heads.  And the rumor is that they were trying to keep this info between themselves because they  wanted to have a very special episode.  Sorry.  Oh, really?  They were going to bring it out?  Ah, I mean, if you want to believe this one tabloid. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, it's from the end.  Stupid shows.  All of them.  Fucking retarded.  And there's nothing on but those shows anymore.  First of all, I don't even know what sitcoms are on anymore.  I can't watch any of those.  Oh, you got the Big Bang Theory.  Oh, Christ.  Why is Fox still pushing that lump of shit?  Because it gets massive ratings.  How?  I know.  How?  Is it CBS?  See?  I thought it was fun.  I'm suspicious, though, because I got a brother out there way out east, and he's pretty intelligent.  He's an intelligent guy. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  And he loves the Big Bang Theory.  And I'm like, really, Scott?  Is it geek humor?  Because usually we just like mock sitcoms for being stupid.  It's kind of funny.  Wow.  Look at me.  A lot of people like the Big Bang Theory.  Look, I watched the one-hour premiere when it first came on, just to check it out.  It was un-fucking-watchable.  It was horrible, typical, you know, set-up-set-up joke kind of stuff.  Yeah.  Very harmless stuff. 
[00:27:00]  Such over-the-top geekdom that they're not real characters.  They're, like, cartoony.  I don't know.  I thought it sucked a dick.  Well, my brother is highly critical.  Yeah?  Surprise.  Surprise that someone in my family would be highly critical.  So if he likes it, it makes me a little suspicious.  Like, maybe they got something going on.  I don't know.  Well, I...  I still don't feel like watching it.  I can't invest time in those shows.  I don't feel like watching it to form my own opinion.  The dumb reality shows with the fucking... 
[00:27:30]  Enough with your tow trucks.  Enough with your fucking breaking into storage lockers.  The only good ones are, like, Hoarders, because it's disgusting,  and it's a real freak show.  And, you know...  There's a show on True TV that I got turned on to this weekend.  What is it?  It can't be real, though.  I got turned on to it, man.  9-1-1 called Boring and Uneventful from Danny.  That's fine.  All right.  We don't need to do that, then.  The Demi Moore call.  People have probably listened to it on their own.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  I gotta...  I gotta say it.  I like that prankster show.  Okay.  I haven't seen that one yet.  With the guys?  Yeah.  I've seen the trailer for it.  I gotta say, they're fucking pulling it off.  Yeah?  It's the three or four guys.  I think it's on True TV.  We were just watching a lot of clips yesterday.  So, this is Candid Camera with another name?  They basically, you know, go into situations and make bets with each other.  And, I don't know, man.  They're fucking pulling it off. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  I kind of fucking like this damn thing.  And it's real?  It seems pretty real, yes.  Because True TV, I don't believe one thing on that fucking channel.  It seems pretty damn real to me.  The White Castle bit I saw over the weekend, I thought it was pretty funny.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  And they got, you know, they got one guy that's behind the register and the rest of  them are somewhere else telling them what to do.  You know, a bit we've seen a million times.  But, I don't know.  They're pulling it off.  I like it.  Hmm.  Yeah, I'm gonna put my stamp of approval on it.  Oh.  What's it called? 
[00:29:00]  Impractical Jokers, right?  On True TV?  I'll have to see this.  Karate.  Teaching, a kickboxing, and a grappling class.  We're doing this in teams.  Murr and Joe versus me and Sal.  We gotta do what they say.  They gotta do what we say.  I'm ready to karate.  I don't know what they're doing.  I don't know what they're doing.  I don't know what they're doing.  Hi, everybody.  I'm Joshua James.  Joshua Joe.  Welcome.  Okay, so, uh, we're gonna start with just some basic moves.  All right, listen.  We're gonna play out a scenario, guys.  Let's play out a quick scenario.  Pretend one of you is a bully.  Let's pretend, for example, one of us is a bully. 
[00:29:30]  Hey, man.  Hey.  That's my parking spot.  I was there first.  Well, F you.  And he goes in for your waist, right?  Using your body weight right there.  Boom!  Go for the attack.  He pulls me in.  Seatbelt locked.  All right?  Seatbelt.  Seatbelt.  Start rolling around.  And then roll it.  And then keep going.  All right, they're just looking very gay on the floor in front of their class.  After you're back this far, keep that suit that one.  And...  Let's say this is a school bully. 
[00:30:00]  Double team that bag and just go to town on it.  So, you're just gonna take turns really getting at them.  Really going nuts, going nuts.  Going to town on them and telling them...  Yeah, the students don't, like, thrilled with their, uh, techniques.  Jumping on like a monkey in a tree, you little bastard.  So, I haven't seen this clip ahead of time, but just, you know.  You know, I like it.  You know, like Storage Wars?  Any of those storage things. 
[00:30:30]  And I hear that's fake, too.  Yeah.  No.  I hear they're putting certain merchandise in there.  Oh, really?  Yeah, pre-loading up the lockers.  Well, they don't want a Geraldo Rivera situation.  Nah, nah.  Week after week.  You gotta find some shit.  Yeah, they gotta put some gems in there.  And, uh, then, of course, uh, the, the, uh, pawn shop ones.  Where, you know, they have an occasional real person that comes in with something.  And they, uh, run through it.  But then they have the over-the-top black guy that's coming in and wants $500 for his Sega Genesis. 
[00:31:00]  And won't leave without it and has to be thrown out of the store.  Yeah.  So fucking fake.  So fake.  But you're watching a little bit, huh?  No.  Not anymore.  Not that hardcore pawn.  That's the worst.  Oh, that one.  And then, uh, uh, what the fuck?  I was watching another one.  They're just all fakeness.  And why so many of the towing shows?  There's like five of them on now, and they're all phony. 
[00:31:30]  Well, you know, when one show hits, then everyone has to kind of, like, make their own version.  Well, what does this sister want?  I'm Shannon.  Hi, Shannon.  How much would you give me for this?  How much do you want?  At least a thousand.  It's very pretty.  For a coat.  The problem is that we don't go that kind of money on those because we can't sell them for that kind of money.  So how much would you give me?  I'd give you a hundred.  A hundred for this motherfucking coat?  Uh-uh.  I want more than a hundred. 
[00:32:00]  How about a hundred?  Feel it, s***.  Feel it.  Feel how good this s*** feels.  It's a good-ass mink coat.  Really fake.  Ma'am.  You got me s***ed up.  It's Fox.  This is a rabbit, a bird, whatever the f*** I want it to be.  Y'all about to give me my thousand dollars.  You're going to give her more than a hundred dollars on there?  I'll give her more than a dollar.  What the f***?  A dollar?  A hell?  Who the f*** is he?  He's my fur expert.  See how bad?  Wow, the acting's funny.  The acting is so bad on this.  Where do they find these people? 
[00:32:30]  He not no mother f***ed ass fur.  Look at him.  I'm not going home with no money.  When you demand of us to give you money that is unrealistic, like a thousand dollars for  a hundred dollar coat, we're not going to do it.  I need rent money.  I'm going to give him a hundred dollar bill.  You better call Sicardi up in this bitch.  Sicardi.  You better call Sicardi.  You motherf***ing security too?  There you go.  Oh!  Y'all motherf***ers don't know who y'all f***ing went up in here. 
[00:33:00]  This motherf***ing mink company.  Now when they get her out, do they tell her...  It's a mink, baby.  Okay.  Do they tell her, can we have our wireless mic back now?  I see a lot of strange strings in American Jewelry.  F***.  Did they say, can we have our wireless back now?  Oh, okay.  Right.  And she'd be fine with it?  I know you're upset.  Please sign this release.  Sign this release, please.  I'm really uncomfortable.  It's terrible.  That was horrendous.  And that's typical.  And that show's doing really well, right?  That is typical of what is going on on that program, yeah.  So what, dude?  There's enough dummies out there that'll buy into that that could be real? 
[00:33:30]  Dude, every day I get tweets from people going, dude, you've got to check out Hardcore  Ponce.  You've got to check out Lizard Lick Towing.  You've got to check out the fucking Bootlegger's show.  You've got to, and I'm like, you're an idiot.  This is lazy programming.  Oh, yeah.  Because it seems like enough people would come into a pawn shop where you would get some  good shit, but you've got to wait around.  And, you know, time is money for these production companies and stuff, so you've got to set up  some shit.  And they want controversy as opposed to the other pawn show, Pawn Stars, where it's more 
[00:34:00]  what the object is, what people are going to get for it.  Oh, okay, that's a World War II memorabilia thing.  And then you sit there and go, oh, it's like an antique road show.  You're like, oh, I wonder what it's worth.  And then they get the experts in.  But this show seems to think, all right, well, that sucks, so we'll get some fake controversy  in here.  Well, antique road show, you know when they sit the one person down and they got a dumb  cabinet from, I don't know, the Revolutionary War? 
[00:34:30]  It's a shaker chest.  And you know damn well it's going to be amazing.  Yeah.  You see all the dummies walking around behind them?  Yeah, yeah.  Those are all the dummies that had nothing.  Yeah, yeah.  So fucking, they had to sit around an antique road show all weekend just to get enough for  maybe a half hour, hour show.  Maybe a couple episodes.  It's a spatula.  Yeah, exactly.  But all those guys walking around, they had their turn in front of the people and they had  nothing.  And it was shite.  Right.  But I guess these other shows, they don't want to wait around, so they got to force it. 
[00:35:00]  Force the reality out there.  That's exactly what they do.  But people are buying into it.  That bothers me even more.  That really does.  And then somebody was like, well, watch Bait Car.  And I was watching that the other day and it's like, I don't know if there's even one  element of reality in that.  There might be like some of the in-car stuff with the perps might be.  Right.  But everything else I know is fake.  Right.  I'm not sure if even the perps are fake.  I don't know.  I just don't trust the channel. 
[00:35:30]  I don't think anything on there is real.  I think.  I don't know.  There's cameras in the car.  I think there's a few setups, too.  Yeah.  I think what they do is they find some local acting class and go, hey, man.  Hey.  I'm serious.  Why not?  Right.  Yeah.  And then maybe they get a few.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because it.  I just think, like I said, if you're going to be stealing a car, you're smarter than this.  Well, they get your luck. 
[00:36:00]  Your luck isn't, you know, this good.  Well, there are car thieves and then there are opportunistic.  Right.  Dummies.  Like, these aren't the smartest motherfuckers.  And they take off in these cars.  See, I think everything else is fake.  I don't know what to make of this.  You must be advised.  Fake cars making the right.  Westbound or Ogle for a pass.  The little tracking thing is fake, but after the fact. 
[00:36:30]  Well, you know, you could accept a little of that production value.  Yeah.  It makes it easy for us officers, for him laying his plan out over the phone.  We'll get a sense of what his intentions are.  He's not talking anymore.  We're making a left.  Westbound or Rochelle.  Right.  You're following me.  Oh, see?  What I got.  I'm going to jump out of the beer.  He's not even speaking English.  I don't know what this is.  I'm going to do it.  Hot to curb.  Shut it down. 
[00:37:00]  Eight cars shut down.  Now he's trapped.  In the car.  All right, Andy, do you want to put your hands in the air?  Put your hands in the air.  Oh, gee.  You must be advised.  Subject seems to be hiding something in the car.  Say yes or no with the air.  They sold me the car, sir.  Hands up!  They sold me the car, huh?  Somebody sold me the car!  The first lie this guy told us was someone sold him the vehicle. 
[00:37:30]  See, I don't...  Yeah, this is tougher to figure out.  Seems real.  The next lie was someone threatened him and ordered him to take the car.  Yeah, we don't...  No, sir.  Haven't watched it enough?  I haven't either.  Are there ridiculous scenarios?  Well, no, they're usually just what you saw here.  Yeah, it's probably pretty real.  But I don't know what to make of all the peripheral stuff.  What do you mean?  Like this and...  I don't know.  I haven't watched it enough.  I don't know. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Where's the black activists like Al Sharpton?  Yeah.  Where they're all doing these stereotypes like this.  Well, they are, yeah.  People love getting black people into pawn shops, into stolen cars and shit, because they're funny.  That's probably why that one is real.  Well, because, you know, they wouldn't be brave enough if they were faking it to just have black guy after black guy after black guy.  Oh, they would have a bunch of white guys.  Oh, right.  You know what?  They would have to fucking, you know, make sure everyone's represented nicely.  Represent. 
[00:38:30]  And every clip I've seen from Bay Car, I've seen black guys in the car.  Yeah, true.  Hey, the Kardashians.  Oh, right.  We can wrap up our entertainment hour.  Oh, man.  All of a sudden, you're watching this show, which is weird to me.  Well, I stopped watching it.  I watched it for a little while.  Yeah.  But now, I guess from the trailers I saw, they're getting into the she's really not happy being married thing.  Is that what's going on now?  The Kim Kardashian?  Yeah.  She wasn't happy after, what, a week or so?  We all know how it ends.  A couple weeks. 
[00:39:00]  And there was a big crying clip last night.  Yeah.  This dumb broad.  There were a few, but this is so amazing.  And was Kourtney just sitting there like, everything's going to be all right?  You know, we just got to talk about certain things because I think it's very important that me and you get together and talk.  As sisters, we, I really feel, can't you tell the emotional wreck that I am right now?  I am real.  I'm right.  She's never shown an emotion.  No.  That Kourtney.  Holy shit.  She's a puppet.  Of course, Khloe has a different father.  She's the only one that has a personality in that entire family. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  She got that personality from the hairdresser.  Yeah.  So this clip from last night, what is this?  Keeping up with New York.  This is Kim, Kourtney.  Keeping New York up with Bruce Jenner.  What?  What?  Which one is this called?  Must be Kourtney and Kim take New York.  Ah.  They're not taking New York.  No.  What does that mean?  New York was just in a tizzy while the two were here.  Don't you remember?  Oh, man. 
[00:40:00]  Was it ever.  What?  Why do they call it taking New York?  What are they doing?  Ah, they're taking New York.  Look out.  We're here.  Yeah.  We're crazy.  They come from the West Coast and they took shit over.  Look out.  Look out, New York.  They took shit over?  Yeah.  You didn't notice?  No.  Not a once.  I live here.  Where was this going down?  All over Manhattan.  Yeah.  It just got crazy wherever they went.  Nuts, dude.  Nuts.  Oh, God.  He's a Christian.  He's everything on paper, exactly what I want in someone. 
[00:40:30]  But for some reason...  Meaning he'll kiss your ass.  Ugh.  And what an ass.  Huh?  This was fake.  This whole thing was fake.  Or she's really stupid.  Take your pick.  He wasn't faking it.  Huh?  No, I know.  He's just a moron.  He's probably the only one that is stupider than Kim Kardashian.  He is.  For some reason, my heart isn't connecting.  I've tried and I've tried, but I don't know what to do.  And I want my whole family at least to back me. 
[00:41:00]  Well, her heart's not connecting.  Sam probably knows more.  Didn't they only go out for like two weeks or something and they got married?  It was more than two weeks, but it was significantly less than a year.  Significantly less than a year.  Yeah.  It was a matter of months.  So why did she have to rush a wedding?  Because it made great TV.  Season's ending.  You got to do something at the end of the season.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Is that it?  What, are you going to stretch it over a couple seasons?  I don't think so.  Wow.  So she just got married, so they had some big fucking season ending episode. 
[00:41:30]  Well, they aired the wedding for four weekends in a row, all weekend.  Right.  So obviously a lot of people had a lot invested in this thing.  She's still trying to tell people this wasn't fake.  Yeah.  They all got together and said, look, let's find a dumbbell.  A real sap.  And you make believe you're in love with this guy.  I love the part where she would, I think it was either, I don't know if it was a tweet  or whatever, but she's like, yeah, I'm going to Minnesota this weekend. 
[00:42:00]  You know, I think I can live here.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was hilarious.  Stop.  She's taking Minnesota.  Yeah.  I think I can live here.  It's kind of nice.  Shut the fuck up.  I don't think so.  Acme, you think I feel good that I met this guy from Minnesota and I feel awful that I  made him move out here and change his whole life and I feel bad for him?  What is she talking about?  The guy didn't change his whole life.  He plays for the New Jersey Nets.  He couldn't just move anywhere. 
[00:42:30]  What is she talking about?  Oh, boy.  I thought you were going to come to Minnesota.  No, but then what?  He moved to L.A.?  Yeah.  In the offseason, obviously.  Yeah.  He wasn't moving there because as soon as the Nets started their practice up again,  he had to be back on the East Coast.  He wasn't going to give up his spot on the New Jersey Nets.  He didn't move out here and, like, change his whole life and I feel bad for him.  I feel sad.  I feel bad for the guy.  I changed his whole life and he fell in love with me and I fell in love with him and now 
[00:43:00]  my feelings have changed.  You don't think I feel bad that I invited all these people to this huge wedding and  it blew everyone out.  Nails on a chalkboard.  I wasted everyone's time.  You know, I wasted everyone's money.  I wasted everyone's everything and I feel bad.  You don't think I feel bad?  At 30 years old, I thought I'd be married with kids and I'm not.  I failed at this and you think that I don't feel bad?  Holy shit.  Boy, you chicks with that 30 mark, I got to tell you, you're all fucking, you all go bat shit  crazy.  No, the 30 thing with her, though, she's heard that before. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  She doesn't want to be married with kids at 30.  She's making too much fucking money.  What this is about, people were on to her, the fake wedding shit, and they got to her  and said, look, you got to have a breakdown and get emotional here because you're looking  like a complete asshole.  Yes!  So they fucking, so they got her to, you know, break down for 40 seconds.  Oh, is that what it was?  Okay.  I would absolutely bet a lot of money on that.  Because I know a lot of girls, they go crazy at 30.  No, and.  If they don't have the kids and the husband, baby. 
[00:44:00]  She's heard that her whole life from other peripheral people.  But she's like a robot.  Yeah.  She doesn't even know what love is.  She has no fucking idea.  So she's heard that.  She went, wait a minute, I'm 30.  I've heard a million times that that's an important age for a lot of women where they  want to be married and have kids by that age.  So I'm going to go with that.  Yeah.  I hear what you're saying, but she's not doing it in that way.  Oh, she's calculated?  Very calculated.  Oh, okay.  And she saw her popularity was dipping a little bit, so they got to her and said, look, you 
[00:44:30]  got to fucking, you got to fucking sell this, that this whole thing was real and that you  were in love and that your feelings changed.  Changed in like a week.  She doesn't know who the fuck she is.  Oh, man.  She's already been married twice.  She's ahead of the game.  She doesn't know who the fuck she is.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  I'm so obsessed with this broad because it drives me nuts.  Are you going to watch when Chloe and Lamar take Dallas?  Is that the next show?  Yeah.  Chloe and Lamar Odom.  She's going with him to Dallas. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  And that's the new reality show.  And I don't know.  I'm surprised you didn't hear this.  A little industry buzz.  Chloe got herself a radio job.  Ugh.  Well.  That's right.  What station down there?  Mix 1029.  She's taking the coveted noon to 1 p.m. slot.  A one-hour show.  How about Kim, Chloe, and the whole family take Cyanide?  Right.  That would be a good show.  Yeah.  They take Cyanide.  A one-hour show.  Kardashians take Jonestown. 
[00:45:30]  Yes.  And she gets national press.  Yeah.  She's doing a one-hour show when people are in their cubicles.  Well, plus commercials and the hits.  Isn't that a talk show, of course?  You do realize, and I'm going to insult a lot of fucking people, that when you get the  midday show, that's the show they give people they don't give a fuck about.  Yeah.  Because no one can listen.  Of course not.  No one can fucking listen.  You do middays, right?  I do.  I'm sure that's one of the shifts at this point.  I don't want to call.  But no one can listen. 
[00:46:00]  No.  It's just like secretaries with their iPod phone.  They're calling it a coveted spot?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  It's not.  Morning drive, afternoon drive, and believe it or not, nights.  Bigger than middays.  Middays are the shittiest fucking slot to have.  Unless you got one of those stations that they just put on at work.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Nobody talks.  Light FM.  Just light FM, yeah.  What's a better time slot, 3 a.m. or noon? 
[00:46:30]  I mean, you know, you fucked me right there.  I guess technically noon.  Fuck.  Don't ever fuck me, Tony.  Technically.  3 a.m. is my time slot.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's really shitty.  Fuck.  You start at 3 a.m. on the East Coast?  Yeah.  That's midnight, though.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Midnight on the West Coast.  My West Coast people.  For some reason, this company doesn't want to acknowledge that we have people that listen  on the West Coast.  There's a West Coast, yeah.  They, for some reason, can't figure that out yet.  So they have all their morning shows start in the traditional slot of 6 o'clock in the morning. 
[00:47:00]  Of course.  There's no West Coast.  Meaning, your big show here on the Opie and Anthony channel is being heard on the West Coast  at 3 in the morning.  Yeah, that makes sense.  What, Kenny?  I tell you, you got big fans in the Phoenix area.  Oh.  Yeah.  So that's, like, close to West Coast.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're mountain time.  What's mountain time?  Is that two hours instead of three?  Well, they don't change in the winter.  Like, they don't subscribe to the, whatever, Daylight Savings. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  They just keep it around all year at the same time.  So it's only two, well, it's two hours now in the winter.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  Why, as a society, we can't get past that?  I mean, why would you want it dark at 3.30 in the afternoon when it's already miserable  for a lot of people because it's winter?  I know.  I hate it.  So it's like, okay, how do we make winter more shitty?  Yeah.  Let's fucking make sure it gets dark at 3.30 in the afternoon.  Right.  Like, we've been, you know, December 21st is what, the shortest day of the year? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  So we've had to go, what, almost a month and a half, and it's still dark really early.  I've noticed, though, it is creeping, which is nice.  It's creeping.  I saw, like, a quarter to five, and it was still a little bit lighter than it was.  What would be the problem if we all got together and said, look, enough of the daylight savings  time thing.  It's just stupid.  Yeah.  To do that to ourselves.  Yeah.  Let's not do it.  Let's not fall back.  The whole calendar's fucked up. 
[00:48:30]  Huh?  The whole calendar's fucked up.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like, some days are 30, some months, some months are 31.  What about the 28 one?  Yeah.  And then there's fucking leap year.  That is crazy.  Yeah.  See, they fucked it up right from the start.  Yeah.  Who thought that up?  I don't know.  Can't you average all those numbers out?  And just make it whatever it is.  Yeah.  And make different months?  Yeah.  And all have the same days?  Yeah.  Why didn't they just put the same days on the months, and then maybe the last month when 
[00:49:00]  you got to clean it up, like that last tile you got to fit in in the bathroom, that's  the one you got to cut.  Yeah.  You figure out how much time you fucked up, and go, all right, well, December this year  has to be a day and a half longer than usual.  So instead of having to go 30 days, high September, April, June.  Yeah.  November.  I never got that.  Yeah.  Have them all, like, 30 days.  Right.  And then have the last one have, like, a lot of days.  37 days or something.  Less days or something. 
[00:49:30]  People are trying to get a Ron and Fez, Opie and Anthony fucking radio war going, because  they're asking about the 11 to 3 slot.  But in their case, they're being heard on the West Coast City in the morning, which is  prime time.  So nice try there.  Nice try there.  That's prime time.  Jesus.  Prime time Sam Roberts.  Good plug.  Nice.  Nice.  He's got a new radio show.  All right, Kenny.  Jesus Christ.  Five me out.  Up top.  All right. 
[00:50:00]  How do you think you would feel if the person coming in to do the noon to 1 p.m. time slot  on your channel had a giant photo of herself in your studio and a mic that was completely  customized with purple rhinestones?  It's festooned.  Chloe on it.  For one hour.  Plus, her photo is the main photo on the website.  Well, we know how that feels.  Do you realize we just did her radio show?  We haven't even started our real show yet.  And you didn't get to any of the hits.  Oh.  She does music in between?  It's called the mix-up. 
[00:50:30]  Of course she does music.  Wow.  Wait, she has a one-hour radio show and she has to play music?  Yeah, commercials and the hits.  Holy fuck.  And I guarantee they're paying her a bloody fortune.  Oh, yeah.  And this is her second radio show now.  No, I know, because it was featured on one of the reality shows.  Where was she last time?  Miami.  Miami.  She was doing Late Night.  Holy fuck.  3 a.m.?  Holy fuck.  No, I think like 11 o'clock.  Fuck.  Crazy.  Do they at least make her go into the radio station or do they set something up at home?  They do for external shots and internal shots where she's just sitting by the mic, but the audio comes from, like, I think they shoot it in another studio. 
[00:51:00]  But then she's there in their radio station just to show, like, she really goes there.  But where is she broadcasting from?  It's a clear channel thing, so she might be in a premiere venue.  Oh, my God.  Holy fuck.  People just don't care.  Holy fuck.  They'd rather have the name than the actual talent.  I'm surprised.  I'm surprised Mr. Scott Greenstein didn't get a hold of this broad.  Get her.  Get her. 
[00:51:30]  This was perfect for him.  A one-hour show that he could pay millions for.  Let's steal her away.  We'll put her picture up in the lobby.  The lower right-hand corner.  Put it up.  Have we been rotated out?  Did anybody look?  Did fucking Scott get, you know, outbid by Clear Channel on this one?  This is perfect for him.  A shitty fucking one-hour radio show by someone that is famous and that doesn't really know how to do radio.  How did he lose out on this one?  I don't know.  Wow, he's slacking.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  Greenstein's slacking.  I guess during the break we'll see if we're still one of the pictures in the lobby or if we've been rotated out because we've been there probably, what, a whole weekend?  The whole weekend, yes.  So, you know, they probably have to put somebody else in there now.  Well, why is our slot the only slot that rotates, by the way?  Exactly.  Book with book radio.  Book radio.  That's stupid.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L.  P.L. 
[00:52:30]  P.L.  Oh yeah, we should play it.  Now that he's obsessively texting me, hey, have you heard my song yet?  Yeah.  It's total Dave.  He sent me a text complaining that we didn't get a chance to play, and he's like, I gave  you the opportunity, now it's viral tough.  It's like.  Is it viral?  I think it's like a 24, 25,000 views.  That's viral.  Did you see the video of him. 
[00:53:00]  That's good.  Seeing, who was it, Makai Pfeiffer?  Yeah.  Outside Wicked?  Fucking Makai Pfeiffer!  Fucking Makai Pfeiffer, man!  Fucking Mackay Pfeiffer  I love the east side, Dave  His videos  Rule  They're just all ridiculous  And insane  We could just play his Super Bowl song to break, can't we?

David Max sports program  You know what time it is  I just wish it was a little longer, man  It was on to something  It's hilarious because  Like most of the Super Bowl songs people write  They're good-natured  And they just talk about the players  And how they're gonna win  And they talk about plays  And why the team's gonna lose  And why this team's gonna win  He just says, fuck Tom Brady 
[00:55:00]  Fuck him in the ass  It's classic Eastside Dave  What's his channel for the people  That want to check out some of his videos?  Eastside Dave videos  Alright, very good  We're gonna take a break  And we will continue  I think Joe DeRose is coming in today  Yeah  Doing a little time with us  And then we got Bill Burr calling in  Hey, Bill Burr  What is he doing?

[00:56:00]  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony Show  Uh  Fire up  He just walked through cops' doors  And rode all over Coliseum floors  I slept on stage at my age  All the people gave 
[00:56:30]  And the poor got paid  And I love speakers  I can't speak  I want my speakers  But I'm not a sneak  My genius has the sand of a furry land  With my kid in  I close to command  My genius is indeed close  As can be  We make a mean team  My genius is indeed  We get around together  We'll cry forever  And we won't be  Had with  Morning man  Brother  My dear  Where's the hook?  Was that the hook?  Getting topical  Hold up  Wait a minute 
[00:57:00]  With the sex man  Good morning, sexy  Good morning  I don't understand why you're making it all about you  Why are we doing this?  I'd be glad to stop this bit if you'd like  Why are we doing this?  Why do we have to stop our show every day  So you can get a little air time?  Adidas  Happy birthday to Adidas, I guess  That's why we're playing it?  No  Not at all  What's wrong, Joe?  Joe DeRosa  Hi, boys  Good morning, Joe  That was funny 
[00:57:30]  I don't know  Maybe he laughed  The way you said the thing  It was just funny  The way you said it  Because we thought this bit was a good idea  But he doesn't know how to do it right  So now we're in a weird quandary  I just  Like he's made it so obvious  Like the Beatles, for example  What?  Performed in public for the last time  43 years ago  So he would just play a Beatles song  Right  And it's like, alright, we get it  But now we told him we didn't like that  So now he's trying to make it a little more obscure  So we can't figure out what it is  But now it's too obscure 
[00:58:00]  That no one even gives a fuck  And they don't even want to try  Like he's not playing songs  That people really know  And  Well, Adidas  You should know this  No, I know  But it's not  This isn't fucking, you know  Led Zeppelin  True  Hey, it's Run DMC  Take it easy  Right  Show a little respect  Show a little fucking respect  Hey, respect  Let's play with Joe  I have a good guess  Because listeners out there  Are trying to figure this out  So why do you think  E-Rock  A.K.A. Sexy  Is playing Adidas today  Well, I'm going to go with  He's playing Run DMC  Versus playing Adidas 
[00:58:30]  Anniversary of Jamester J's death  No  No  See, no  That's what I just tried to explain to you  Did I miss something?  He used to do it that way  Where he would play Run DMC  Because, I don't know  It's Run's birthday  Okay  Now he's going the other way  And don't think  I guess it has something to do with sneakers  Right?  Um  Fuck  Yeah, I'm going to go with the  And your guess was wrong  About Adidas anniversary?  Yeah, of course  That was a dumb 
[00:59:00]  The release of a  Signature collector's type of shoe  Adidas sneaker comes out today  No, that's not it  And now the song's over  And we're still trying to get it  Oh man, that wasn't supposed to happen  Holy fuck  Wait  Yeah  Oh, Jesus  Something about the Coliseum  Yeah, right  I just heard them announce  Coliseum  Uh  No  Nothing  I'm getting angry 
[00:59:30]  I'm just going to start making fun of E-Rock  Ah, that'll happen  It's making me mad  Uh, wow  You got anything?  I got nothing  Does it have something to do with sneakers?  Uh, yeah  It does  Black History Month starting tomorrow or something?  Oh, oh  The anniversary of the first time a black guy ever stole somebody's sneakers  Ah, that's gotta be it  Right?  That's not it  No?  Shit, I thought that was it  All right  First time a black guy threw his sneakers up on a power line  Anyone? 
[01:00:00]  Anyone?  Ah, Jesus  Huh?  So it's something to do with sneakers  Yeah  Or shoes  Oh, so it doesn't have anything to do with sneakers  Just shoes?  No, I think they were sneakers  What the fuck could this be?  And who the fuck cares?  All right, give us another, um  Clue  Uh, let's see 
[01:00:30]  The, uh, the shoes or sneakers were used in an unorthodox manner  You ate them?  Somebody fucked somebody with a shoe  Ah  No  Somebody drank something out of a shoe  Champagne  No  Someone beat someone with a shoe  No  Oh, they threw the shoe at Bush  No  Damn it  That would be good  Although he's playing Adidas 
[01:01:00]  They beat the statue of Saddam with a shoe  No  I don't think we need the answer  We should just move on  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
[01:01:30]  He doesn't even know if it was sneakers or shoes.  Oh, God.  In an unorthodox way.  Well, the Nazis would pile them up.  Probably not it.  Is that it?  No, that's not it.  Is it the anniversary of a Nazi movie? 
[01:02:00]  Nope.  A Robin Williams movie about Nazis?  No.  Jacob the Liar?  No.  Anniversary of the Shoe Bomber?  Oh.  That would be it.  Jesus.  But he plays Adidas?  Why would you play this?  And you're not even sure if it was a shoe.  It was a shoe.  He's called the Shoe Bomber, not the Sneaker Bomber.  How about Don't Step on My Blue Suede Shoes?  Yeah.  Brown Shoes Don't Make It.  Goody Two Shoes. 
[01:02:30]  The Angel's going to wear my red shoes.  Blue Suede Shoes.  Yeah.  Shoes, Shoes.  Yeah.  Christmas Shoes.  Yeah.  It wasn't a sneaker.  That is.  He wasn't even sure.  People are just saying, worst fucking one ever.  He's called the Shoe Bomber.  Horrid.  I know.  That really is bad that he went, it could have been a shoe.  No.  He said that.  It's in his title.  He's the Shoe Bomber.  Yeah.  But Iraq went, when you said it's sneakers, right?  He went, well, I guess it could be a shoe. 
[01:03:00]  It's like, no, it is a shoe.  He does not understand this, the whole concept.  Because I like how everyone at Ant's Guesses, he would be like, the Nazis, shoe bomber.  I was thinking it out.  I was thinking it out.  Why wouldn't you pick a shoe song?  That is a shoe song.  No, it's a sneaker song.  It's a shoe.  It's subtle, but it's a sneaker song.  That song is even beyond a sneaker song.  That's like a commercial.  It's a direct endorsement for something. 
[01:03:30]  Look, if you couldn't find a shoe song, then maybe you stretch and go for a sneaker song.  But there are a lot of shoe songs.  But that's a specific, it would be just as bad if he played a song called, like, My Timberlands or something.  It's like, when you're naming a specific shoe, it's like, it really takes you out of the headspace of the game.  Yeah.  I would have went with a shoe song.  Yeah.  Let's name all the shoe songs again.  These boots are made for walking.  Blue suede shoes.  Goody two shoes.  Brown shoes. 
[01:04:00]  Don't make it.  Goody two.  Goody two.  Christmas shoes.  Christmas shoes.  Boogie shoes.  Boogie shoes.  There you go, Sam.  What's boogie shoes?  I think it was on Saturday Night Fever, wasn't it?  Oh.  Yeah.  Bum.  Ba-na-da-da.  Ba-na-da-da.  Ha-ha-ha.  That's it.  Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.  I don't want to put on boogie shoes, to tell you the truth.  This would have been perfect.  This would have been perfect.  This is perfect, E-Rod.  See? 
[01:04:30]  This would have been perfect.  Right?  We would have heard shoe, and I would have immediately said shoe bomber.  And then you could.  Yeah.  Adidas throws you off.  It's like Adidas.  He was right.  It was right in cue singing that.  Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma bomber shoes.  See, you could even change it.  He knows his shit.  That sounded like at the concert when the singer starts doing the acapella, and then it comes  in under them.  Like, you really nailed the key to that.  That was impressive.  Ba-ba-da.  Ba-ba-da. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  This would have been better, Iraq.  What were you thinking?  Or not thinking?  No, it's...  Adidas sucks.  It's a great song.  I know you know that we're trying to just beat you up, but in this case, you were just  way off.  Now you've got to figure out the days where we're just trying to beat you up for the sake  of it, and the real ones.  Yeah, this is a real one.  This is a real one today.  And by the way, there haven't been any fake ones.  No.  Not yet, anyway.  No, no.  Keep trying. 
[01:05:30]  If it's the shoe bomber, you've got to immediately think shoe.  Shoe.  A shoe song.  They don't call him a sneaker bomber.  No.  Shoe bomber.  Right.  The other thing, too, is he played a song by, like, an iconic music group.  This song...  Who the fuck sings this fucking song?  Right, right.  And I love how Iraq wasn't even sure if it was a sneaker or a shoe, but if he lit his  sneaker on fire or whatever, they would have said the sneaker bomber.  Yeah.  I saw Casey and the Sunshine Band once at a rodeo.  Wow.  At a rodeo.  Five years ago at a rodeo.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm up for that. 
[01:06:00]  How did they do?  No, I just went to the rodeo when I lived in Texas.  I wanted to see it, and they were there.  How'd they sound?  It was like when a disco group does a show in 2006, and everything sounds like the dance  remixes, because they updated all of it.  Oh, don't update it.  Just play it like it was.  I just remember him running around after they did, like, some of the things with the bulls,  like, running around that dirt pit singing fucking...  Probably this song.  And a bunch of cow shit.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like, it's over when, like, during the chorus, you have to scrape the shit off of 
[01:06:30]  your shoe.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  Not quite a dance floor with a disco ball going, and a nice club with a bunch of chicks.  Yeah.  You ever check out that bull riding?  Have I ever done it?  No.  Just check it out.  I went to Madison Square Garden one year.  Madison Square Garden.  That's what it was.  That's what the rodeo is.  Was it the rodeo or the bull riding?  I think they did both.  The bull riding's a lot different.  They did both.  They did the rodeo, then they did the shit where the bulls are charging at the clowns.  Well, the clowns are always in there. 
[01:07:00]  Fucking clowns.  Yeah, it was bull riding.  That's what it was.  Bull riding, all right.  But it's called the rodeo.  In Texas, the rodeo is like this big yearly...  Wait, do they...  It's like a big carnival thing they do.  Do they rope the cabs in the bull riding?  Now, I'm not sure.  Oh, wait.  Maybe that's what it was.  It was the roping.  Well, there's got to be a bunch of...  There's a bunch of different events in the rodeo.  The PBE...  What is it called?  The PBR?  Holy fuck.  It was awesome.  I really enjoyed myself.  They do roping.  They do bronco busting.  They do bull riding.  And then they do pole bending. 
[01:07:30]  Where's Pete at with wrapping the balls?  Don't think they like that.  No?  With the twine.  And they really don't do that with the bulls.  The bucking strap is in front.  It doesn't really...  It just...  It gets...  It's their flanks that they don't like that they kick at.  I lived most of my life just assuming that bulls were assholes.  Yeah.  And then you realize, no, we're just making them have to fucking...  Right.  You know, buck you off.  Buck them off.  Buck them off.  I had no idea.  I just thought they were just cunts.  Do we not eat... 
[01:08:00]  Excuse me.  Do we not eat bull meat?  Is it like different from cow meat?  Steer meat.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Do we not eat that?  I think it's the same thing.  It's just a different...  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it is.  Bull's a bull, right?  I know there's a different type.  And how they're raised and fed makes a big difference.  Well, I was wondering if that's why they do stuff with bulls.  Because they're like, well, we don't eat them.  So once they impregnate the cows, who gives a fuck?  That's probably a few of them that are like, man, fuck it.  But even those, they mash up into dog food and whatnot.  Well, yeah, we're bullfighting. 
[01:08:30]  Well, morally, I mean, I'm not a...  I really am not one of these over-the-top animal guys.  But that drives me fucking nuts.  It's sad that they kill the bull.  I hate PETA, but it makes me sad that they kill the bull.  So I'm a little...  Yeah, that's a little...  I'll side with PETA on that one.  That's part of their society.  They're not changing that anytime soon.  A lot of countries have done away with it.  They have?  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of countries that have...  Spain can't.  ...typically done it are doing away with it.  Know why Spain can't?  Because of Ernest Hemingway. 
[01:09:00]  Really?  Ernest Hemingway had to romanticize it,  so now you can't get rid of the bullfighting?  I think Barcelona's giving it up.  Really?  I think so.  Thanks, Sal.  I remember hearing something like that.  Coffee talk.  Barcelona.  Fucking Hemingway.  Fucking Hemingway.  Made all that awful shit beautiful.  Yeah.  Fucking suicide and womanizing and booze.  War.  Bullfighting.  War.  Just made it all sound really good, didn't it?  Just made it, wow.  That's pretty fucking good.  He took a horrific situation and made it all fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah, daisies and marshmallows. 
[01:09:30]  Well...  That's wonderful.  I'll tell you what, the...  You know, bullfighting, that's such a great example.  Look at this fucking...  Look at this fucking...  Sorry, I interrupt you because the video's on.  Look at all the shit hanging off the bull that they threw in him.  Yeah, it's sick.  Bull's bleeding.  Yeah, they've already pierced him a few times with some little knifey sword things.  Dude, it's up there with...  It's up there with, like, all those great things that I love when Uncle Tom Americans  act like Europeans are so much more sophisticated and better than we are ethically and morally. 
[01:10:00]  It's like, really?  Yeah.  The Hitler support in the fucking 40s, bullfighting, legalized prostitution at fucking levels that we've never even seen here.  You know what I mean?  It's like, the drug abuse, like, alcohol...  It's...  Go fuck yourselves.  They do plenty of scumbag shit over there.  Yeah.  I love...  But where the bad guys...  I love when the bull gets one.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen some shots now. 
[01:10:30]  The running of the bulls.  You ever see the one where the horn went right up the guy's jaw?  Yep.  And came out his mouth?  Yeah.  And then the other one where it's right up his asshole?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love when the bull gets one in, man.  Bad news.  They kill the bull every time, right?  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Bull never wins.  How many bulls do they go through in a day?  Oh, no.  Wait.  That's odd.  Every one of these bulls dies?  Yeah.  They kill those motherfuckers.  Right in front of everybody?  That they're fighting.  Yeah.  That's the whole thing. 
[01:11:00]  It's the man versus bull.  Yeah.  Every time?  Even the preliminaries?  I don't know enough, but I would assume...  Even the openers get fucking killed?  I've never heard of the old folks home for the bulls that are...  I would think they fuck it up a little bit and let it heal for a few months and bring  it back in.  Do they still do the running of the bulls?  That's still allowed, right?  Yeah.  Do the bulls get hurt during that?  Fuck yeah.  They're running on cobblestones.  I like when you see them slide out and hit the wall.  Yeah.  Expect to see an explosion.  Yeah.  Oh, this guy's getting fucking tooled. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, he's fucking him.  Look, the bull's fucking his face.  Why did it just cut the soccer?  I know.  It's the same sport.  It's the same sport.  People die.  Do people...  You know what?  If you're going to do the bullfighting, though?  You versus bull.  None of those stupid clowns and everything else to distract the bull when you're in trouble.  You can't go...  Dude, a bull will kill you.  Well, then that's why they've got to weaken them down and make them all stupid before the  Toreador gets out there. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I agree.  If you're going to do it, man up and fucking do it.  But at the same time, it's like a man will never win against bulls.  Do you ever watch those things like on Jackass when they do the thing with the bulls?  It's crazy.  It's like they get fucking annihilated, man.  It's amazing how high up in the air they could throw a human.  I know, right?  He's like, wow, he's 20 feet in the air.  How did he do that?  That's got to be scary getting thrown that high up in the air because it's just your body  is like, my body should not be doing this right now.  Yeah, yeah.  It's spinning and you're lucky.  You don't even know where you are. 
[01:12:30]  You just know gravity is going to latch on you any second.  We got a guy who's been holding for 40 minutes.  What?  He's obsessed with the whole daylight saving time thing.  Oh, my God.  It was a throwaway, dumb little fucking joke and this guy's obsessed that we're getting  wrong info out there.  Go ahead, Jerry.  Wow.  Sorry, man.  I was just trying to keep the integrity.  You know, you guys are my news source.  I want to keep it, you know, accurate.  Yeah, I hear you.  Yeah.  All right.  It was a throwaway, dumb joke, but go ahead.  What do you want to tell everybody? 
[01:13:00]  No, just because we are in standard time and it does suck.  We should always be on daylight savings.  I can't argue that.  Isn't that sort of what we said?  No, you said that we're in daylight savings now and it sucks.  All right.  Okay.  You're right.  Yeah.  So what happened now?  Let's see.  Why are they?  I just want to, you know.  So what should we do now?  Oh, have a nice day. 
[01:13:30]  Should we move our clocks?  Have a nice day.  Should we move our clocks?  Well, I guess the mistake was saying we're in daylight savings time right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something like that.  I know.  You're like, it's either daylight savings time or it's not.  Right.  But I don't care.  Right.  I just call it daylight savings time no matter which way we're turning the clocks.  Get it?  Why do we switch it?  Why do you even have to switch it?  Why don't they just leave it?  I don't know.  It was for the farmers back in the day.  So a lot of people will tell you, but it doesn't make sense anymore because let the farmers  figure that shit out.  Yeah.  Let the farmers just get up an hour earlier and whatever. 
[01:14:00]  Like when you have the sun still out at 9.30 in the middle of the summer and then the  middle of winter, it goes down at 3.30.  There seems to be a problem there.  We can't figure this out and balance that out a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It should just be one time all the time.  Right?  Would that work?  I think it would work.  Yeah.  I don't understand what's wrong with going.  It just gets darker in the winter earlier.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  What's the big deal about that?  How about whatever it takes?  The sun stays out until 9.30 at night. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Every night.  However far we got to move that fucking clock.  Jesus Christ.  Alaska.  That's fucking daytime for 40 days out of the year.  You don't see them adjust.  Fuck.  We got to wait.  It's 3 p.m.  all day for the next 40 days.  You know, that's fuck it.  That's what it is.  Well, we run this planet.  We can't figure it out.  Do we really run this planet, though, Ope?  We're just renting.  Or are we just sharing it with the...  We're just renting.  Do you think we're sharing?  No.  I'm competing, too.  I'm joking.  Do you think we share as we destroy the entire planet for our needs? 
[01:15:00]  No.  No.  I'm joking.  Yeah.  Look.  You're right.  I don't know why we can't just get together and just figure it out.  Look.  We all hate when it gets dark so fucking early.  Yeah.  So we're going to move some shit around.  Keep up, people.  It really sucks, man.  And then you wake...  Like, I woke up today.  I mean, I don't get up this early every day like you guys do.  But I woke up today.  It was...  I hated.  Well, I'm also still renting at 34.  So, you know, there's a give and take there. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  That's true.  Yeah.  I was, too.  So if it's any consolation, look at me.  Actually, that is a consolation.  Thank you.  Can I hang a picture of you on my wall so I don't...  Oh, feel free.  Because it's just...  Everyone should.  I'm getting closer to ending it every fucking day.  Just stare at those kitchen knives a little longer each afternoon.  Oh, man.  I'm surprised to find out you're only 34.  Thanks.  Oh, wow.  You know what?  I thought you were like our age.  That's mean.  That's just mean.  I wouldn't wish that on anybody. 
[01:16:00]  God damn.  I'm very confused by that.  Well, the guy's breaking his hip every other week.  I assume he's got to be in his 40s.  I fell coming out of a bar.  It wasn't, you know, it wasn't my fault.  I swear it wasn't like a drunken fall.  But last time I...  The fucking steps were and I slipped.  Hold on.  I was fortunate enough to do Bob Kelly's podcast with you and Bobby.  Yes.  And when I showed up to Bobby's apartment, you had a fucking thing happening.  Because you fell down.  I fell in the shower.  Again, slippery.  You know what? 
[01:16:30]  I got the mat now and I can't slip anymore.  But a very slippery shower.  So he falls in the shower.  That's like an old person thing to do, man.  I know.  It really is.  And he falls leaving a bar.  So excuse me for assuming you got to be in your 40s at least.  Look, I still have a renter's tub.  When you rent, you have an old school bathtub.  Like you don't have a nice, you know, tiled, you know, fucking granite floor.  And, you know, you have that 1960s fucking bathtub.  What do you get that tub that they sell to old people with the door on it where they can just walk in and then shut the door and it fills up? 
[01:17:00]  I guess the water pressure keeps the water in.  It has a seat and a massager.  I know.  I need a chair in my shower.  I need a chair.  You can make calls on your jitterbug phone while you're fucking sitting on your hover around around your house, around the home.  We got to get you some handles for your bathtub.  The handles.  And we got to get you a seat.  And we got to get you one of those fucking, I don't know, where you pull it off the wall. 
[01:17:30]  Old people are constantly just holding on to shit.  I know.  I'm going to be, I'm like about, I'd say a year away from being one of those guys that moans when he moves.  Joe, you okay?  No, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Get up off the couch.  You give a big, oh.  I do that already.  When I bend over, I already, I go, oh.  Ah, that's sexy.  It's awful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to do that with a chick.  I'm just naked.  I bend over to pick up the condom off the floor that I tossed over the side of the bed. 
[01:18:00]  You want me to solve that for you?  You got to do some cobras.  What's cobras?  A little fucking stretching activity.  Get rid of that lower back pain.  Oh, activity.  Uh-oh.  Oh, gee, yeah.  Activity, that's what they call it for old people.  You get on your belly, and then you push up with your hands, keeping your pelvis on the ground.  You know what?  And then you push toward the floor.  Guess what?  It pushes all those discs back into place, and you're not going to be aching as you get up off the couch as much. 
[01:18:30]  I'm just going to drink instead.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  You know what?  You don't make that sound when you're drinking.  Make it the next morning.  I can conquer the whole world when I'm drunk.  Ah, yes.  So, where are we at?  Christina Aguilera.  What's going on with her?  You mean X-Tina?  X-Tina.  I got X-Tina figured out.  What?  Have these guys seen the clip?  She was singing at the Etta James funeral. 
[01:19:00]  You know, at last.  Yeah.  That song?  At last.  Godspeed to you, Etta.  And she had some shit dripping down her leg.  What?  Shut up.  You didn't see this?  No.  What's wrong with you?  Are you shitting me?  She's got a pretty good version of that last, though.  She's built it out here.  Yeah, it was live and everything.  She's got a pretty good voice.  But I got this shit figured out.  Oh, can you put your tits away at the funeral, you fucking coosh? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, what is that?  Jesus.  Oh, you don't like tits, Joe?  It sounds like what Steve Martin would sing in his stand-up.  I could do a fucking duet with this shit.  All right, her vocal aerobics.  My love is so long.  Why do white girls sing in this shit, motherfucker? 
[01:20:00]  Why are people whistling?  Do you hear people whistling at the singing?  It's like, come on.  Well, there's a black funeral, so they'll probably take it easy.  But they do have life.  They're kind of like, yeah, well, it's all about feeling good and happy.  That fat is working for her vocal cords.  Yeah.  She's plumping up.  She can sing better.  She is chubby. 
[01:20:30]  She used to be a little thing.  Oh, was she a little thing.  Are they going to pan down?  They better.  They have to listen to all this song.  Why is this funeral being held in the courtroom?  Yeah, well, some of the people that were going to it.  It's as close as they could get.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  Here's the pan out.  Can you see it in that shot?  No.  Well, they screen capped that shit.  You can fast forward, man. 
[01:21:00]  We don't have to listen to all this song.  Yeah, Jesus Christ, Sam.  I know this is your kind of music.  Sam's people like this.  You know, they're so far away because I think they might have saw that shit was dripping out of her.  What do you think was dripping out of her?  I already know.  Did she blow a seal?  I figured it out.  Oh, okay.  Pan gasket.  Huh?  Blew a pan gasket.  There's her legs right there.  All right, let's see.  All right, back to the legs.  All right.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Go to a good picture. 
[01:21:30]  A big picture.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, Sam picked up.  All right, let's see.  Oh, fuck.  Ew.  Dude, she's having her period.  Well, I saw Uta Pippig running in the fucking Boston Marathon once, and she had that running down her leg.  She's having her period.  Who the fuck runs down the leg like that?  Someone that might not have been as absorbent as they should have been, or maybe didn't put a tampon in.  You went with the number one answer.  Yeah.  I'm going with self-tanner. 
[01:22:00]  And because she's a bit on the chubby side, there's some sweat going on.  And the sweat collected and kind of like...  Oh, okay.  Sweat dripping down her legs from her gash.  You know that's coming directly from her.  Look at her fat knees.  What happened to her?  Look at her fat fucking knees.  I remember Ann used to...  God, those are ugly knees.  You know what?  You used to really like her, too.  Oh, she was the best.  I'm going with period, too, because...  Going period.  I'm going with period.  There's two streams, or whatever you want to call them, going down one leg.  Yeah.  So why isn't it...  There's not...  Her legs aren't all sweaty. 
[01:22:30]  Why isn't it like...  Everywhere.  Why isn't it like a river?  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  She used to have...  Now, that's the one where she's in the pool with the little blue swimmy on and...  What happened to her?  And her ass is sticking out.  Babies.  I don't know.  So she...  It's literally...  Oh, come on.  I think...  Look at that.  I think she was starving herself back then.  She was never supposed to be that small.  I don't know.  She did a Liz Taylor.  Liz Taylor went from smoking hot to, like, your aunt.  Yep.  Where you're like, what the fuck happened to Liz Taylor? 
[01:23:00]  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  Look at these pictures.  What she used to look like.  We are looking at old school.  I don't know, man.  And I think if it was her period, there would be more action.  Oh.  If all of a sudden that period started, man.  What's...  Any other theories?  My theory is the self-tanning thing.  Blood, sweat, or tears?  Or maybe she had fucking explosive diarrhea.  That could have been ass leakage.  Maybe she's trying to lose the weight and she's doing those things that make you shit  out the fat.  Oh, fucking puke.  And when she hit in some of those hard notes, some shit dripped out.  Her fucking gasket seal on her bung wasn't tight enough when she's singing. 
[01:23:30]  Would you smell that?  Would you smell that?  Well, you know...  Back in the day.  I mean, she was up on stage.  I don't think anybody could have smelled it from when they were sitting.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, see?  She was anorexic, eh?  That's not anorexic.  That's beautiful.  Yeah, but she was not eating.  That's not a normal body on the left.  No, that's good.  She looks great.  No, no.  That's a normal body.  That's great.  Stop it, right?  Jesus.  Stop it, because that's...  I think she could have been a little thinner. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  No, that isn't real.  Yeah, that's Stevie Nicks.  Oh, no.  It's like Christine Aguilera.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Is that fucking Sally Struthers?  It does look like Sally Struthers.  That's Sally Struthers.  Jesus.  Wow.  What the fuck happened to her?  Oh, shit, man.  Can we hear the rest of Ed last?  That is not her with the pink shirt.  That's Kelly Osbourne, right?  Where?  That fucking mess.  Let me tell you how hip Kelly Osbourne is.  She's purposely dyeing her hair gray now.  She's a fucking slob.  That's some hip shit right there. 
[01:24:30]  She's a fucking slob.  Who would do that?  She would.  Yeah.  I hate that fucking whole family so much, which I...  Oh, you're in the wrong seat to say those fucking...  No, no, no.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  Accusations.  Let me just cover...  You're in the wrong fucking seat.  Jesus.  Can I just cover what I'm going to say here?  I like Ozzy's music a lot.  I hate his fucking family, though.  I can't stand his fucking family.  Even Jack?  Jack couldn't be nicer.  You know what?  Maybe... 
[01:25:00]  And more normal.  I don't know.  I don't know much about Jack.  It's Kelly and the wife I can't fucking take.  I just can't take him.  What are you doing?  Kelly?  What?  Kelly was on...  Is this a real controversial opinion?  Yes.  Oh, my goodness.  Really?  You better hope no one fucking tweets Jimmy with this.  Huh?  No.  I like Ozzy.  I fucking hope.  Oh, would you stop it?  Don't stir up shit here.  Stir up shit?  You said it.  I didn't ask you for your opinion.  I like Ozzy.  I like Ozzy.  I don't like the wife and the kid.  Do not tweet Jim Norton. 
[01:25:30]  I agree.  I agree with Joe.  Would you stop it?  Please let Joe slide on this one.  He doesn't know what he's saying.  I agree with Joe.  I don't think Jimmy would disagree with that statement.  Jimmy lives for the entire Osborne family.  Oh, really?  Oh, he loves the whole family?  The whole fucking family.  Well, you know, that's fine.  Him and Sharon kind of, you know, email every once in a while.  Oh, do they really?  You're fucked.  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  All right.  You're fucked.  I kind of thought...  We might need Troy Kwan in here today. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, what do we got?  A controversy?  Well, Spinozzle on Twitter writes, they keep the time change to self-antidepressants.  We go to work in the dark and go home in the dark.  That is some conspiracy shit right there, my friends.  That's what people are doing.  They're trying to sell more antidepressants.  They keep it dark with the harp system.  Shut up.  What a tool that motherfucker is.  I kind of like this thought.  Yeah.  If you got nice sunny days in the middle of winter, you're not going to need a pop of 
[01:26:30]  pill for as much.  People get depressed.  People get depressed during the winter.  I'm sorry.  That's another new disease they came up with recently.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I zoned out.  What is it called?  Winter sucks.  Yeah, it's called fucking winter depression.  What is it called?  Seasonal allergy?  I get it bad.  Seasonal what?  I think it's seasonal depression.  Seasonal depression.  Oh, God.  I get seasonal depression.  Hmm.  Yeah.  I mean, you could keep trashing it.  I don't care.  I'm not going to, you know, whatever.  But in a bad winter, I get it. 
[01:27:00]  What are you depressed about?  Because you got to understand something, guys.  I don't get it.  Just because it's dark and a little colder, you get depressed?  Dude, when it gets...  Winter sucks.  Look, this winter's been fine.  I'm fine this winter because it's light.  Well, where does it go from, God, this sucks, to, oh, I'm depressed?  When I can't leave the fucking house...  Oh, Jesus, Joe.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying because of depression.  I'm saying that when I can't leave the house because of the snow and all the bullshit,  it sucks.  Dude, you know what?  Some of us have to fly around this fucking godforsaken country to pay the rent, and when 
[01:27:30]  it starts snowing...  All I'm doing is writing a note because Bill Burr is calling soon.  Oh, no.  When it starts snowing like that...  My note just reads he can't leave the house.  Well, listen.  In winter.  No, no, no.  Because don't twist it around.  You know what?  Oh, he's going to twist it around.  You're being evil.  You're being evil, Opie, today.  He's going to twist it around.  I'm sorry, Joe.  I don't care.  Listen.  Let's learn from you. 
[01:28:00]  What's the problem with winter?  When you can't...  The icicles?  Forget it.  Oh, boy.  I tapped out.  I can't get it.  Oh, boy.  I don't have the energy.  I don't have the energy to punch upward today.  The energy.  I'll behave.  What?  Make me understand.  Well, you don't...  Look, you were just saying yourself, okay, here we go.  Oh, I think I got you cornered on this one.  I'm excited.  Uh-oh.  You were just sitting there pissing and moaning.  Why does the sun go down?  Why can't we keep it out until 9 o'clock at night? 
[01:28:30]  You were just...  That's depression.  You get depressed when it gets dark so early.  No, my point is it sucks, but it doesn't go into depression.  I make the best of it, like everyone else.  But some people can't function.  Why?  Um, I think a lot of it is economic.  I really do.  I think people that can't, uh, when the weather really affects your ability to do the things  you want to do because it adds extra expenses onto things and it limits what you're able  to do because it's, you can't get here, you can't get there easily, you start getting 
[01:29:00]  depressed.  It's like, you know, for instance, let's say on a Friday night...  Get Dr. Steve.  ...I'm supposed to have friends coming in from out of town.  Right.  That's a big fucking thing for me because, hey, it's something to look forward to.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, it snows.  My buddies call up.  They go, we can't get there because of the snow.  That's like a fucking depressing thing because I'm like, well, now what the fuck am I going  to do?  Now you're just going to sit in your house and it's going to be snowing and you're going  to be bored.  Yeah.  And then you look at the weather forecast and it says next five days snow and rain and  you go, fuck it. 
[01:29:30]  What the fuck, man?  I couldn't even tell you what the forecast is for tomorrow.  I always look at the forecast.  Stop studying that forecast shit.  That'll drive you nuts.  I always look at it.  I think some of the depression happens because what?  You don't get enough sun in the winter?  Well, that's one theory.  But some people really get affected by it.  I don't like the fact that I look out my window and I see a bunch of fun summer things  to do that are all battened down and I got to wait.  Exactly.  I don't like that.  I'd rather, the summer's great.  You fucking, you run out, get shorts and a t-shirt, you're fine. 
[01:30:00]  Well, you got to, you got to live where it's warm all the time.  Well, I can't because I work here.  Yeah.  It's a catch-22.  The work here affords me the luxury.  This ends soon and then let's go retire.  I hate when you guys talk like that.  Well, you joined the party late, Joe.  Yeah, I know.  It wasn't my fault.  Listen, your pals have had 10 good years in this program.  What the fuck do you want from us?  Oh, my pals is I watch every one of them move out west. 
[01:30:30]  Just fucking sitting here.  Oh, God, it's over.  It's fucking done.  You know what?  Fuck it.  I'm ending it today.  Is that it?  No, Joe.  You heard it here, folks.  When they pulled me out of the river, no, it was on purpose.  You really get to, oh, fuck.  If you kill yourself now, this is going to be a great segment.  Wait, you really get depressed, though?  No, listen.  Listen, here's the thing, too, though, man, is...  Here's the thing.  Yeah.  Listen, okay?  Okay. 
[01:31:00]  Fuck.  What the fuck was I going to say?  You got me in spinning in circles over here.  Well, we got Dr. Steve on the phone, so you might win this.  Maybe it is a real thing.  I don't get it, though.  The seasons are great.  You don't want to live where it's hot all the time.  The seasons are great.  But I'm saying when it's a crippling winter, it makes me depressed.  I have a brother who would agree with you.  Yeah, he's a nice guy.  He gets bummed out when winter hits, and he no longer lives where winter hits.  He lives in Long Island, I thought. 
[01:31:30]  I don't know.  He's out west somewhere.  Oh, okay.  I don't know where exactly.  Oh, so...  Hold on.  Dr. Steve only has a few minutes today.  So it affects him, but I never understood when he would tell me this shit.  Dr. Steve.  Hey, man.  Seasonal depression in the middle of winter.  What's that about?  Yeah, it seems to be a real thing.  You know, our bodies are used to or get used to a certain amount of sunlight every day,  and we huddle inside.  Sun definitely has metabolic effects on the body. 
[01:32:00]  You know, we produce vitamin D and other, you know, effects with direct exposure to the sunlight.  And the reason that they believe that seasonal depression disorder is real is because when  you expose these people to increasing amounts of sunlight, you know, artificial sunlight,  they tend to get better.  But what's the difference between a lot of us, middle of winter, we're just like, ah, this fucking sucks. 
[01:32:30]  I wish spring was here.  And people that...  Right.  And people that get downright depressed like Joe DeRosa.  Yeah, it's a spectrum.  And some of that is just winter sucks.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  But when does it become a problem for some people?  Well, when it becomes a problem.  You know, it's when it starts to affect their ability to live their lives on a daily, you know, 
[01:33:00]  and do their activities, the daily living and those kinds of things, then it becomes a problem.  Turn on the lights for Joe.  We're going to solve this fucking depression right the fuck now.  Listen, let me...  We are going to give you some sun today, Joe.  Just right on Joe, too.  Not me and Ant.  Oh.  Right on Joe.  There are lights that you can buy, and they're not very expensive that you can expose yourself to.  And if you have, like, a stationary bicycle or something, doing it while doing exercise helps even more.  Yeah.  Well, they're turning the lights on here in the studio, those big, giant fucking lights. 
[01:33:30]  We're hitting Joe with some light right now, Dr. Steve.  Look, look.  We're going to solve this depression today.  In all fairness...  You're lit up, Joe.  In all fairness...  You're like the point in the fucking...  In all fairness, I could be fucking...  I could be fucking, you know, speedboating through Monaco, and I'd still be borderline suicidal.  Oh, okay.  I could have a model sitting on my face as I was sailing through the fucking Keys, and I would still be like... 
[01:34:00]  Eh, eh, eh, eh.  Eh, could be better.  So, in all fairness, I'll say that.  But my thing is this, too.  Yeah.  You know, with all due respect to the people out there with medical affliction or whatever you want to call it, I think you've got to be a little bit of a pussy to let the winner shut you down.  I think at some point there is...  You know, look, it bums me out, and I get pissy and depressed and sad, but I get my fucking job and my work done, and I still have a life. 
[01:34:30]  I don't sit there and go, I can't.  That's kind of horseshit.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  We're going to put Arthur...  That's extreme.  Dr. Steve, hold on a sec.  Stay there.  We've got Arthur on Long Island that really wants to yell at Joe.  Oh, okay.  Arthur, go ahead.  Go ahead, Joe.  Good morning.  Arthur, speak.  In the Navy submarine force, which is an all-volunteer force, there's no lights that substitute for sunlight. 
[01:35:00]  You're out there two, three months.  Nobody's depressed.  This whole thing with light and this whole market of buying artificial sunlabs is bullshit.  You're depressed.  It's in your genes.  You need more help in life.  That's what I just said.  This guy is in a submarine two to three months at a time and doesn't get depressed.  Really?  Yeah.  That's called psychotic.  Yeah.  And it's called the depression can't outweigh the fucking intense fear that you're having being underwater in a tin can. 
[01:35:30]  For three months.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I get this fucking...  This is a guy that screams when he jerks off.  Just cut off from everything.  You think you can handle being a submarine for three months?  No.  No, I don't think so.  That would be terrible.  I would be fucking miserable.  Unless it was full of hot chicks, right, guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  But they'd probably be nagging. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  You got that.  Where do I keep my shoes?  Because, you know, they all got like 100 pairs.  I don't like the underwater pressure.  I'll give you some pressure right against your cunt.  Yeah.  Yo, you're amazed, man.  I sure hope there's more than one bathroom on this submarine because you know how long they take to get ready.  Oh.  Hey.  God.  Well, good luck, Joe. 
[01:36:30]  I hope you feel better.  Is that the doctor or the submarine guy?  Submarine guy.  Submarine doctor?  Submarine guy.  All right, submarine guy.  Good luck to you.  Thank you, sir.  I don't think we ever took a phone call from a submarine guy.  Mark that down.  That was a first?  Dr. Steve, Joe DeRosa needs a little medication.  Which one would you suggest for him?  Well, I just started taking Sammy, and it's been pretty good so far.  What's Sammy?  It's like an herbal.  Yeah, it's something you can buy over the counter. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, ineffective.  Okay.  That's right.  Yeah, that's what it's called.  Ineffective.  Right, right.  Anything you can buy over the counter, really?  Over the counter?  Stop it.  Might as well take a Tic Tac.  What's weird is Sammy has some data that shows that it's good for arthritis and depression.  Wow.  So it sounds a little bit like snake oil, but, you know, it's got a little bit of data.  The second it starts working and they find out it really does work, it will be pulled  from over the counter and made prescription only.  It's not cheap.  It's fucking expensive.  So they can make real money off it. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  It's expensive, man.  They're making money.  Yeah.  Somebody's making money.  It's like $50 for, like, 20 pills.  If they leave it to the people, to the consumers, to just take it off a shelf and pay for it,  it means that it can't work because it probably can't kill you.  No.  See, the only stuff that's good for you is the stuff that, if taken improperly, can kill  you.  That's the only way a drug really is good.  Can you, listen.  I could chug a bottle of Pepto-Bismol. 
[01:38:00]  It's not going to do anything for me.  This is the problem.  I'm too impressionable, so I start doing good things for myself, and then I talk to somebody  like you, and then I go, eh, he's right.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Why bother?  I'll just curl back up on the living room floor with a...  I really do give people that why bother vibe, you know?  Eh, fuck it.  You do.  I know.  You do.  I apologize.  You drag other people down to where you're at.  I do.  And we all know it.  You're right.  And you know what?  I wish I could argue that point.  We're all worse because we let you drag us down.  Yeah.  We're worse than you are. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, Dr. Stevenson.  I'd be upset, but fuck it.  I don't care.  If someone's prone to depression, should they be drinking as much as Joe DeRosa?  Well, no.  Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, so it's probably not helping anything.  I love when people say alcohol is a depressant.  It is like after you're not feeling the effects of the alcohol anymore.  See, when you're drinking, then you're not depressed.  Hungover.  Depressed.  No, but I mean, it's a central nervous system depressant, and just adding yet another log to the fire when you're depressed isn't a good idea. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, get prescription drugs instead.  Who are depressed will treat their depression with alcohol rather than going, you know, it's just called self-medicating, rather than going and getting treatment.  You can drink while you're undergoing treatment for depression, but if Joe really has seasonal affective disorder, if he'd email me after the show, I'll send him some information on some lights that he can get, and he can try it. 
[01:39:30]  I mean, you know.  You've got to get lights for your apartment now?  Yeah, I don't want to get the lights, but listen.  Drinking.  That might fuck up your love life.  Drinking.  You bring a brown home to your apartment, you've got to turn on your fucking...  Can I turn on my depression lights?  Can I turn on my sun lamps?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It's fucking...  These are for my depression.  Oh, my Lord.  I need to turn them on.  Are you okay with that?  You don't mind having...  Can you get undressed now?  You don't mind having sex in bright sunlight.  Yeah, and fucking...  That's the only way you can have sex. 
[01:40:00]  In this sun simulator.  These help so I don't look at the knives so much.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Steve, I mean, you know...  Hold on.  I've got to add our pal to the conversation.  Bill Burr.  Hello.  Hey, Bill.  You picked the perfect day to call the show.  We've got Joe DeRosa sitting in for Jim Norton.  And he admitted to us that he gets a little depressed in the winter and that he can't leave the house. 
[01:40:30]  I did not say that.  I wrote it down, Joe.  Yeah, I know you did.  Word for word what you said.  He can't leave the house in winter.  No, what I said was...  What's the matter, Joe?  Joe, the sun doesn't shine in your world as much.  How you doing?  He's lying.  He set me up for a tragedy.  You all saw me write it down.  You know what, Joe?  You're not tough enough to make it in this business.  So now...  You're a big softie.  Oh, look who's talking.  You're listening to some albums.  Look who's talking. 
[01:41:00]  He fucking...  Mr. I moved out to sunny fucking L.A.  And I'm basking out in the fucking...  You're doing great.  And you're open for me on the road.  Great job, Joe.  Shut your mouth.  Why don't you hop in your Prius and drive into a tree?  Slowly.  He's reaching for us.  Yeah, look at...  He's searching.  Look at this, though.  We got Dr. Steve on the phone, Bill.  And he wants...  He's suggesting...  He's suggesting...  Mr. Steve, I didn't call up to talk to that cunt.  Oh, holy Jesus.  I came out to throw myself out to let you know I'm going to be in Atlanta. 
[01:41:30]  Yes.  Oh, snap.  Atlanta.  The Chocolate City.  On fucking January 9th.  Well, Chocolate City is D.C., isn't it?  No, it's another Chocolate City.  It's New Orleans, first of all.  Oh, it's New Orleans?  But, you know, you three racists can apply it to whatever city you want.  Exactly.  But, Bill, I got to tell you, Dr. Steve has suggested that...  Joe DeRosa gets sunlamps for some...  So he can bask in the sun even when it's... 
[01:42:00]  Shut these fucking lamps off.  I'm sweating to death.  Shut these fucking sunlamps off.  And we got these bright lights in the studio that were just shining on Joe and only Joe.  Just to take some of that depression away from him.  Please, I'm dying, dude.  Shut these fucking lamps off.  Who's going to pick the lamps up for Joe?  Yeah, because he's got to...  Someone's got to leave the house to get the lamps.  Yeah, you want us to bring over the sunlamps for you, Joe, and set them up nice for you?  Huh?  Do you want us to bring over the sunlamps?  We can order them on Amazon.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  We can order them right now, Joe.  What watch list... 
[01:42:30]  Look up sunlamps for Joe.  What watch list does that get you put on?  Yeah.  This guy ordered a bunch of sunlamps.  What's he doing?  We can order them on stopbeingapussy.com.  Listen, what I said was...  That Opie is now so twisted out of fucking control.  What I said was, you can't leave the house because of the snow.  That's what I said.  Not because you can't get off the couch, when the snow fucks up your traveling and shit  like that.  Well, that's different.  But he's already talking...  He's already taking something called Sammy. 
[01:43:00]  ...50 degree winter days we have now.  We're in the golden age of global warming.  What snow are you talking about?  Oh, shut your face.  Golden age of global warming.  Oh.  Well, this fucking winter has been a bit suspicious on the East Coast.  Last winter, we got snow dumped on us for fucking two months straight.  Nobody was going, oh, the global warming's slowing down.  Would it change in a year?  Yeah.  I'm just fucking around, Joe.  No, I know.  First of all, Joe, I'm not a scientist and neither are you, so fuck you and your stats. 
[01:43:30]  According to my charts, when I was not depressed enough to look at last year's winter...  I was responding to Opie's claim that this winter has been questionable, not you.  It's been very easy.  Joe, the second I hear your mouth, it's offensive to me, and I go on the other side.  Holy shit.  Hey, Bill, you came out swinging today.  What happened?  What's going on?  I'm sitting here in my bathrobe.  I'm feeling like a big shot, you know? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah?  And, you know, I just figured, you know, I'd do what I had to do.  I figured I'd go for the weak bird.  Sitting there in the room, just like a predator.  All right, well, what are you going to do?  So where are you going to be in Atlanta?  I think the Bergen Theater, is that the name of it, on February 9th.  I'm doing a little redneck tour.  Oh, nice.  I'm doing Charlotte on the 7th, and then I'm doing someplace in Alabama, the Stardorm.  Damn, you best keep your liberal bullshit to yourself there. 
[01:44:30]  We got it.  We got it.  Yeah, are you going to do your global warming routine in Alabama?  Tell us a joke, faggot.  Stop talking about the heat so much.  Why wouldn't I?  Absolutely I would.  I'm going to make fun of Jesus.  I'm going to do everything else that's going to make that gig fun.  It's supposed to be you, Joe, you crowd pleaser.  Oh, man.  That hurts.  Hold on.  Holy shit.  Hold on.  That's going to hurt.  Dangerous Bill Burr is on the phone. 
[01:45:00]  Holy shit.  Watch out.  Here he comes in his Corvette.  He's dangerous.  He doesn't play by the rules.  He's dangerous.  Holy shit.  I can't even look at Joe.  Hey, Bill Hicks.  Hey, Joe.  Bill Hicks.  Are you going to do your global warming bit down south?  Ooh, I bet they're not going to like you down there.  And then he spins it around.  That's.  For more hackiness.  This is Joe.  You're an encyclopedia of hack.  What do you got next, Joe? 
[01:45:30]  Bill gets a little sensitive when you go at him a little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  Why are you getting touchy, Bill?  I'm breaking your balls a little bit.  I haven't seen you in a while.  I'm having a good time.  Now it's all fun, huh, Joe?  Huh?  I can relate to this, Bill Burr.  I'm getting nervous.  You're nasty.  Throwing fuel on the fire.  Stop it, Opie.  You're nasty.  I know what you're doing.  You're nasty.  You stop it.  No, this is what Opie always does.  Opie goes, oh, look, I can make two people fight, and then I can eat my blueberries. 
[01:46:00]  We're onto your games, Opie.  You're not fooling anybody.  I don't like that you three got together and are telling other people my game.  And you're fucking twirling your beard over there.  I don't like it.  You're twirling your beard all proud of yourself.  I don't like it.  Hey, BillBurr.com, because there's a million dates.  You got three in the area.  You got Bergen and Jersey.  You got Foxwoods, and you got Westbury, the old Westbury Music Theater.  Oh.  On the 16th, the 17th, and 18th, those three dates.  So it's getting a little confusing.  You should go to BillBurr.com for all the tour dates. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, Bill.  You know what?  I probably hyped the wrong one, then.  I don't know.  I was supposed to be hyped for New Jersey.  I don't know.  I guess that's the Bergen PAC at Inglewood on the 16th of February.  I was at the mall yesterday.  I got to ask you about something, for real.  Fucking, they got spots in front of the mall.  You know, it used to be handicapped.  They still have the handicapped parking.  But now they got spots at the Walt Whitman Mall, Ant, for energy cars, electric cars.  Why the fuck are they getting a better spot? 
[01:47:00]  And that spot is, you know, they paint it green.  What is that about?  Because those fucking queens are too limp to walk all the way from the back of the parking lot.  But why would that be an incentive to get an electric car that you could get really close to the mall?  That's fucking weird.  Is that incentive?  People are fat, Opie.  But I'm saying, but are you seeing that out there?  A lot of fatties out there.  But are you seeing that out in L.A. where you're getting some special treatment because you got the Prius?  No, because Priuses out here are a dime a dozen. 
[01:47:30]  I can't tell you how many times I walk out to a parking lot trying to open the door to the wrong Prius.  Oh, really?  That many around, huh?  Wow, really standing out.  That car is the greatest car you could ever buy.  It really is.  Just as far as, you know, you can go out and buy some flashy car and you have your fun with that thing.  But that's just like some stuck-up cunt who's always going to need something, you know?  Prius is your friend. 
[01:48:00]  Start right up.  $27 to fill it.  I love it.  Wow.  He has really gone L.A.  Yeah.  No, no.  I did get another vehicle.  That's why I just want to lay in the weeds and listen to you guys fucking go on and on.  I went the other route.  Little surf and turf.  Little Gemini for you.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  I bought an old Ford pickup.  Oh, you did?  Oh, wow.  That sounds cool.  It's got a 361.  It's three on the tree.  Yeah.  And it's the loudest fucking thing I've ever driven and my neighbors hate me. 
[01:48:30]  Look at you.  Am I a man now?  Do you feel like the car?  Not really.  Not really.  Pickup trucks are also a very California thing.  You really are just like the accountant that owns a fucking motorcycle now.  Oh.  Puts the suit on Monday to Friday that wears the leather on the weekend.  Oh, we both know you saw a picture of it and you said it.  I believe you said that's dope.  What year is it?  Maybe you misunderstood him.  That's why Joe can use terms like that's dope. 
[01:49:00]  Because he raps about the cul-de-sac he grew up in.  Wow, he is on your shit, man.  It was hard, yo.  What year is the pickup?  It's 1968.  For real?  Wow, that is like, holy fuck.  I always wanted like an old pickup.  That's the one my pops used to have one just like that.  This is how much I'm into old trucks.  And you can get them for nothing because nobody wants them.  Those baby boomers don't really give a shit.  This thing was actually like five grand cheaper than my fucking Prius that I got like four years ago. 
[01:49:30]  Wow, we're looking at a picture right now.  That looks awesome.  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  Fuck, I would absolutely pick up one of those.  Yeah, it's great.  It's a good time.  It's got the original AM radio.  Oh, man.  I swear, I used to drive in the passenger seat of that thing with my drunk dad going down the Ortega Highway.  Yeah, same fucking one.  Only it didn't look that nice, believe me. 
[01:50:00]  This is how much I like old trucks.  I actually watch No Country for Old Men.  The reason was to watch, look at those old trucks.  Just look at the old trucks.  Have you driven a three on the column before or was that your first time?  No, I didn't.  And they fucking, there was nobody there really to explain it to me.  The guy just dumped the thing off the truck.  And he goes, I think first is down.  So actually, I just drove it up the hill in first gear. 
[01:50:30]  And then I kind of, I just went online.  That's the best thing about going on the internet.  You can actually just figure it.  You can just, how do I drive a 68 F100?  And they'll just show you how to do it.  And I did the first couple of days, though.  I fucked up.  Bringing it straight up was reverse.  Yeah, reverse is straight up.  Yeah, it's not about having your hand there.  You just felt like you were going to throw it in park and it was actually reverse.  That wasn't a good sound the first couple of days.  But I got it down now.  Oh, cool, man. 
[01:51:00]  Look at you.  Fucking, you know what?  That is a very California thing, too, a pickup truck.  You know, where did all the fun go?  All the funny went out the room.  You guys are like, you know what?  That actually is a nice truck.  You fucking faggot.  Yeah, it's dead sound.  There you go.  Bill's taking shots at all of us now.  I know.  What's going on here?  He's a madman.  How do you guys like it?  What happened to you?  Bill does a preemptive strike.  What was that? 
[01:51:30]  Opie.  My high voice.  Because I don't understand what's going on today.  I'm going to eat my blueberries.  I have to break out my granola bar sandwich.  We're all getting nervous now.  He's taking shots at all of us.  Also, I think the big thing out here, can you believe Kobe Bryant's wife just took him for $70 million.  Jesus.  But doesn't he have another $70 million easily?  Yeah.  Easy, right?  You've got to go.  Who gives a fuck what he has? 
[01:52:00]  There's got to be a cap.  Exactly.  No, I know.  That was $70 million.  What the?  How is that legal?  They should put the headline in the paper that says, the highest paid prostitute ever.  And put a picture and $70 million.  I'm going to give this one a little more slack than the other ones, giving the almost convicted rape.  Who gives a shit?  That happened during their marriage.  Why didn't she leave then?  Joe, what does that have to do with anything?  Yeah.  And you think that's worth $70 million, you girl? 
[01:52:30]  Look, I said I'm going to let this one go.  Joe's a girl.  Joe, here's a little stat for you.  Consider your little winner stats.  Some guy just got out of jail.  He went to jail for 25 years for first degree rape.  I know.  In that time, forensic science caught up, and then it'll prove not only did he not do it,  he wasn't even there.  I know.  He got $4 million.  Yeah, that's it.  I know.  Sorry for sticking you in a cage for a quarter of a century.  Here's $4 million. 
[01:53:00]  Kobe's wife is getting $70 million.  Yeah, well, I think she...  With Dorito dust and her cleavage.  Hasn't had a fucking job her whole life.  Look, she...  $70 million.  She suffered public humiliation.  Oh, Joe.  She suffered public humiliation.  Okay?  The guy went out and did something disgraceful.  It disgraced her.  She's entitled to a good chunk of change for that.  Now, listen.  Listen, everybody.  I can't believe you're not being beaten with the microphone you're speaking into right 
[01:53:30]  now, Joe.  Joe, first of all, when he got caught cheating, all right, that relationship was over.  Right.  But she hung around like some jaded cop trying to get her fucking...  She's trying to fix her marriage, Bill.  She was trying to fix her marriage.  Oh, I see what you're doing.  You're trying to...  Oh, you know, Joe.  Oh, you cocksucker.  He didn't see my poker face.  I was trying to get you all worked up. 
[01:54:00]  God damn it.  You shoulderless fucking pussy.  Why would you try to do this?  Why would you try, Joe?  Because I don't like you, Bill.  Wow, this is scary Bill Burr.  No, I was just trying to get you worked up, and it didn't work.  Oh, me.  Eat your blueberries.  I don't have blueberries today.  You know what?  I got eggs.  You know what, Ope?  He is going at you.  I don't like how he thinks he's bigger than this show.  Why don't you put him in his place right now?  Matt, Joe's going to eat his bacon, egg, and cheese. 
[01:54:30]  She got...  I'll eat breakfasts.  Breakfasts.  Get along with everybody.  How the fuck did she get 70 million?  I'm really bothered by that.  There's no reason she should have gotten 70 million bucks.  She didn't do any of that.  I took care of it a little bit, sure, but what the fuck?  The argument of whether she deserved it or not is a different argument.  You go into a divorce case, and you go, given the disgrace of my husband's alleged rape,  I want that...  She's going to get it.  I'm not saying it's right.  But this has nothing to do with the disgrace.  Every woman will get the same exact thing. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, no, you don't even have to go with it.  You don't even have to go with the disgrace.  Well, California...  You know what it is, Joe?  She's used to a certain lifestyle.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But despite the fact that both of them failed to make the relationship work, only one person  has to pay for the failure.  Right.  And if she's used to a certain lifestyle, why does that then become the guaranteed lifestyle  she should have for the rest of her fucking life?  Why is that like...  Because she's just a girl.  Oh, a poor girl that...  Unless they're talking about a job position... 
[01:55:30]  Right.  ...or if there's a raise or something like that...  Or if there's a picture...  Like, I'm just as good as you.  Yeah.  I'm an independent woman.  But then if you make a lot of money, then they...  I'm just a girl.  What am I going to do out there?  Right.  Ugh.  Yeah, it's...  Yeah.  Well, can I add to this?  Mike is telling me not only $70 million, she also got three mansions.  Yep.  Three mansions.  Wow.  No, it's ridiculous.  Now she's got more houses than Kobe, I think. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, California is a no-fault state, so she could have actually gone across the street,  fucked the neighbor, told him, told Kobe about it, and then just been like, well, it's  not my fault, because according to the law, it's a no-fault state.  Yeah, give me half your shit.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it's...  That law's got to change out there.  It's never going to change.  Who's getting fucking married in California?  Who the fuck would do that?  Jesus.  And why aren't they fighting that law?  Because, I'll tell you why, because guys aren't organized. 
[01:56:30]  We used to beat them with mop handles a hundred years ago, so they all got organized, and then  we were like, all right, all right, you can vote.  All right, all right, we'll let you get out of the house.  And it's just been a hundred years of all right, all right.  Right, you can smoke, you can vote.  The men of this country got together.  Sorry.  So, you know what?  We got to go old school and start hitting them with mop handles again.  Yeah.  We have no other choice.  Put it back in the box.  If they're not going to change the laws, we got to fucking break out the mop handles. 
[01:57:00]  Well, start slow.  First, we should be allowed to hit them with the mop part.  Yeah, just the mop part.  Just push it in their face a little bit.  That's almost funny.  Right.  First, okay, let's stair step up through this.  First, you should be allowed to dunk their head into the mop water three times.  Okay.  Then you can hit them.  Then you can throw the bucket of water on them.  Then you can hit them with the mop part.  Then you can hit them with the handle.  Then you start the handle.  Yeah.  There's one other one.  Make raisin lumps.  You can put the empty bucket on their head and then hit them with the mop handle.  Cartoon style. 
[01:57:30]  I like that.  Yeah, I like the way they wake you up in the military.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm in.  What would you know about the military, Joe?  Hey.  Oh, boy.  I've fought wars.  I've fought plenty of wars.  Personal battles.  I want to thank Dr. Steve for adding a lot to this conversation.  Is Dr. Steve still here?  It's been amazing.  Dr. Steve.  It's been amazing, Dr. Steve.  What are you, the doctor of boring?  Oh, no.  Joe.  Oh, Joe.  I did not do that.  I'm kidding.  I'm joking, Steve.  It's Joe.  I'm just joking.  It was just a joke. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, girl laughed.  DeRosa said that?  Oh!  Yeah, I did say that.  Southern gay accent.  Nah, shit.  God damn it.  I tried.  Almost.  We almost got it.  Hey, Bill.  God, I love Joe.  Hey, Bill, you're a...  Let the record stand.  I love you.  Oh, good, good, good.  I'm digging your podcast.  That Monday morning podcast thing you do?  Oh, thank you.  It's so fucking just conversational, Bill.  Him and his dog just sitting in a room talking. 
[01:58:30]  It really is good.  There are not many web podcasts I watch.  I listen to the whole thing, but I listen to the whole show.  It's very good.  Bill's got a good one.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Bill, to add to that, no one's getting back to us.  We want to throw a few hours on the weekend here.  Oh.  Oh, you know what?  Well, I already did the serious XM.  Thanks for all the content. 
[01:59:00]  We're never going to pay you.  Exactly.  I don't understand how that works, though.  Like, I don't do that.  I get paid an exposure thing.  Right.  You know what?  Good for you.  That's fair enough.  Listen, I got off the plantation, and I'm not coming back.  Good for you, Bill.  My podcast is in the north.  We free up there.  Yeah, we free up there.  Fair enough.  I've been reading this book called The Limit, and it's about Formula One racing and, like, you know, the heyday of the 40s and 50s, and the amount of death that people, like, they say cars would hit each other, and they'd go flying into the crowd. 
[01:59:30]  Like, 20 people would die.  Horribly burned and disfigured.  No, no, they had one.  They actually have footage of some of this stuff.  Like, the hood flies off the car at, like, 150 miles an hour, and it's going like a Frisbee, decapitated a whole row of people. 
[02:00:00]  Jesus.  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  I looked up a guy.  He was a German guy.  His nickname was Von Crash or something.  And his fatal accident, he gets hit, and his car just does a left turn right into the crowd.  Holy shit.  And the funniest thing about back in the day when you got fucked up was the first thing people wanted to do was get you on your feet.  They were just like, get him on his feet.  Come on.  Get him on his feet.  They didn't know any better. 
[02:00:30]  It's like, no, you're not.  Don't move him.  Get him on his feet.  He'll be okay.  His vertebrae is grinding together.  Quick, stand him up so his organs can slide down.  Yes.  He can just sever his spinal cord with that fucking ribbon candy of a spine he's got now.  I started looking those up last night on YouTube.  Ah, shit.  Look at this.  Oh, man.  Sorry.  It's radio, but holy fuck.  Look at this crash. 
[02:01:00]  Now, there's another one.  The most brutal one I saw, and you got to go off of YouTube to see it.  Holy shit.  This car crashed, and this was like during, like, the, I don't know, the Jackie Stewart era,  so they look more like modern race cars.  Jackie Stewart.  Yeah.  And these two kids went across the fucking racetrack, you know, to run over with the fire extinguishers,  and I don't know.  The drivers didn't know they were coming across, so the second kid gets hit at, like, 180 miles  an hour.  Oh.  It doesn't even look like a person. 
[02:01:30]  It looked like somebody just took a water balloon.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, and this is a fucked up thing.  The driver, his head gets, he hits the fire extinguisher with his head at 180 miles an hour,  and he dies, and they both die.  Wow.  Hitting a deer in a Dodge Neon.  Shit.  Jesus.  Wow.  We just watched that clip of the car that went into the crowd.  That fucked a lot of people up right there.  Jesus Christ.  Holy shit. 
[02:02:00]  Was it the one where the hood comes off and goes, and over, like, flying like a fucking  pizza pie?  No.  Not that one.  We saw the one where his car flipped upside down and kind of spun a few times in the crowd.  Oh, deer getting hit by.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  What happened?  Where'd the deer go?  A deer got fucking slicked up high up in the air it goes.  Who dislikes a video like that?  20 feet in the air, that fucking thing went.  Wait a minute.  That was a fake deer.  You think that's fake?  Dude, the car didn't even get damaged. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, no.  It ran out.  It ran out.  Yeah, man.  It didn't even damage the car, though.  Because it scooped it up.  It hit it like a fucking...  It was like a wedge.  Like a wedge.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That's fucked up.  Dude, here's the thing.  Nobody would sue, and they would actually finish the race.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, I want to finish the race at least.  Okay, how many people died?  Get him on his feet.  Get him on his feet.  Get him on his feet.  Get him on his feet.  He's got a race to run.  Ah, the good old days.  Yeah, walk it off.  Before lawyers. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, just walk it off.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  You guys, if you ever go to that auto racing, that's one of the funniest things you'll ever go to.  No.  The level of genius that's going on in the pits, it's like NASA level.  And then like 30 yards away, it's like some of the dumbest people.  Woo!  Come on, Harry, get it!  Scooby!  Ford's going to be chevy today, let me tell you.  Love that whole rivalry for what? 
[02:03:30]  500 a long time ago.  And we were just sitting there drinking Budweiser's, absolutely fucking obliterated, absolutely shit-faced,  as we watched basically these spaceships going around.  Oh, Bill's running out of stuff to talk about, everybody.  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck?  Bill's very aggressive, very...  Moody.  You're putting...  No, he's preemptory.  Yeah, he's...  I had...  We had some people over.  My girl was like, you know, we should have a party. 
[02:04:00]  Let's have a party.  So I go, all right.  So all my friends are creeps, so none of them showed up.  And it was mainly all her friends over here who then brought other people that my girl didn't even know.  And I just realized how fucking annoying it is to have somebody you don't know, like, enjoying sitting on your couch.  At one point, I walked into a room and there was some kid laying on the floor with his head on this throw pillow,  and I wanted to fucking boot him right in the side of his skull. 
[02:04:30]  He wasn't really doing...  That sounds healthy.  How rude.  That is a rude thing to do, though.  Why?  To lay on the floor?  To fucking guest.  He's laying on the floor.  No, that's the whole point.  It isn't rude.  I agreed to have a party, and then I'm mad that they're there, Joe.  That's not what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying.  I thought it was rude for you to fall asleep on the floor.  Huh?  No, I don't think he was... 
[02:05:00]  It's not a frat party.  I think he was laying like he was posing for a picture, he's saying.  Fuck that.  Get off the floor.  Get him on his feet.  I don't...  I mean, look, if you're going to lay anywhere in my house, I'd most prefer the floor versus, you know, a piece of furniture.  I think maybe you should be up socializing and fucking adding to the party.  Get him on his feet.  Fight people over to fucking fall asleep on the floor.  On your floor, Joe.  If it's a good fucking party, they should be.  You know what I'm saying?  What are you talking about there, Joe?  You know what I'm saying?  I'm talking about drunk.  Well, if it's a party that, like, Bill and his girl are putting on, I would think that's more of an upper echelon party than my, you know, drunk fest at my house. 
[02:05:30]  I was going to say, what are you arguing?  I've been to your parties, Anthony.  It looks like a fucking opium den by the end of the night.  I know, but that's what people expect.  Everybody's just fucking sleeping in the pool and shit.  I don't know who's alive.  All right.  Point.  Hey, Joe, do you have any, you got any Super Bowl predictions for me?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Bill, I'm going to go.  Let me explain what just happened here. 
[02:06:00]  Bill's in a fucking rare mood.  Joe doesn't know shit about sports.  So we're about to get a wonderful answer.  Oh, right, right, right.  I don't know.  Are you kidding me?  Joe knows all about sports.  Come on, Joe.  Let me hear your expertise.  What do you think?  What do you think about this matchup?  I'm calling the Pats all the way, but it won't be an easy win.  The Giants are going to bring a steel knuckle game on Sunday.  Line driving hard defense.  They know the pocket.  They know how to work in it. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  That almost sounded like it made sense.  Kind of, if you didn't know any better.  I'll give him that.  Bill, you got anything else anybody's going to say.  Ma'am, are you pumped your Pats are in it or what?  No, we backed into the Super Bowl.  We beat a Jesus freak running a high school offense, and then the Ravens missed a fucking 18-yarder.  Half the guys in the crowd could have kicked it through in their feet.  You know? 
[02:07:00]  You're a little nervous.  What annoys the shit out of me is that the Patriots are favorites.  Oh, yeah.  We already lost to the Giants this year.  Yeah.  You know, I just wish the Giants were dealing with that pressure.  Like, if the Giants were like three-point or four-point favorites like they should be.  Right.  We don't have any defense.  I was...  I can tell you all about it.  We don't have any defense.  What about the Pats defense, DeRosa?  What do you think?  The Pats defense is impressive to look at, but not much in the game itself. 
[02:07:30]  They've got what I like to call a cheesecloth line.  Lots of holes, but looking as if it's built together.  It is easily taken apart, and once it's broken into pieces like anything else, it is penetrable.  The Giants will come through with a bullet-storm offense.  Jesus.  Well, that's just as good as any sports talk show out there.  They all babble, too.  Yeah.  When we were talking about this last week, I was amazed that the Pats were favorite.  I'm like, how did that fucking happen? 
[02:08:00]  Because they still see Tom Brady's face, and they still see Bill Belichick's face,  so they think that they're playing the Patriots from, at this point, like 10 years ago.  Yeah, Belichick's face hasn't changed, so you're right.  You just assume, oh, it's got to be the amazing team.  Well, the two most guys that they're going to show are still there,  so they feel like, you know, Bruschi, Vrabel, Tyler, all those guys are still on defense in the nuts.  So, I don't know.  I'm just happy and actually shocked that the New York Jets aren't in it. 
[02:08:30]  You know what?  All right.  All right.  What did I do to you today?  All right.  That wasn't on you.  Come on, man.  Are the Jets your team?  I'm actually, yeah, they are, and that's why I'm going Pats.  I was fighting people this weekend.  I'm like, you can't just jump from one New York team to the other.  The Jets make me sick.  That's what everybody does down there.  Yankees, Mets, Giants, Jets.  Well, let them do it.  I'm not doing that.  The Jets aren't.  I'm not saying you're doing that.  Oh, well, maybe if you had a baseball team you didn't share between eight other states.  Oh, see, the Red Sox. 
[02:09:00]  Here we go.  Uh-oh.  Maybe you had a couple more up there.  You should have said it about the Patriots because they're called the New England Patriots.  It's not the New England Red Sox.  Oh, right.  Well, you still share it between Connecticut.  What do you think?  Connecticut doesn't jump on the Red Sox bandwagon?  Oh, Anthony, why would you talk this?  Why would you talk this talk?  Come on.  The Jets and the Giants play out in New Jersey.  Come on.  I don't care about that.  You're really going to do this?  I don't care about that.  When does Connecticut become New England, by the way?  What city?  Let me brag.  Seven championships in ten years. 
[02:09:30]  Ran the table in the last seven.  Even New York with its 10,000 teams has never done that in the history of sports.  No.  Never done it.  All right.  All right.  Just want a Stanley Cup, so why don't you shut your pinstripe fucking face?  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Yep.  Fair enough.  Yeah, you guys could have the Stanley Cup and the Super Bowl.  They got it all.  God damn.  They got it all.  Hey, Bill.  Bill, a legit question, though.  When does Connecticut become New England?  What city? 
[02:10:00]  Hartford?  What do you mean?  Well, lower Connecticut is in part of New England.  Just drive north until you see the most drunks.  That's where New England starts.  We go down to, like, halfway through Connecticut, and then you start running to, like, giant and  Yankee fans.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I'm saying.  They went from being the Boston Patriots to the New England Patriots as no one was going  to their games when they were in the NFL.  So they came up to the brilliant, well, let's include New Hampshire, too.  And despite the fact that we still suck, maybe some people show up, which really didn't happen. 
[02:10:30]  But Connecticut skits up.  You're right.  You've got a lot of New York fans in Connecticut.  And then, like, northern Connecticut, they're New Englanders.  It's like the Golden State Warriors.  You know?  Where are they?  They included the whole state.  Yeah.  Mm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Tough.  Hey, Joe, if you were Tom Brady, what would you have to be thinking?  Who?  What does he do?  You're kidding. 
[02:11:00]  He's a quarterback for who?  Oh, my God.  No.  I'm Tom Brady.  I've got to be thinking.  Wait.  It's this bad?  You don't know?  No.  Tell me.  I'll do it.  Yeah.  It's this bad, but I still want to do it.  What's Tom Brady do?  He's a quarterback, right?  No.  It's not about what he does.  It's about what he does.  Even Sam knows that.  Quarterback of the Pats.  What does he need to do Sunday?  Quarterback of the Pats.  What does he need to do Sunday?  Give me a couple names of players so I can – give me a couple names of the Giants players.  Riley Odoms.  Okay.  Riley Odoms.  One other one. 
[02:11:30]  Everson Walsh.  Okay.  And Bill Tetley.  Okay.  Tom Brady.  I know if I'm in his shoes, I'm hitting that field with one goal and one goal only.  Take down Riley Otis Mayhem.  When you're looking for a player good in the boot, coming around the bend, it's made him  all the way.  Brady needs to shoot through the pocket.  If he's going to shoot through the pocket, he's got a chance of getting into the fire. 
[02:12:00]  Once he's in the fire, points get earned and the Pats take home the bowl.  That's pretty good, man.  Oh, my God.  The what?  You're 1932.  I know.  Yeah, that's true.  Don't they still talk like that?  Yeah.  The sports guys?  They sure do.  Hey, what do I know?  What do I know?  I'm just a big fucking faggot.  Hey, you pussy.  Did you get enough sun?  Yeah, I'm sweating my fucking balls off under these lamps.  Bill, you've got to understand, this whole time we've had really bright lights on Joe. 
[02:12:30]  No one else.  Burning up in here.  Burning up in here just to get some of that depression out of his soul.  See?  What does that look?  Dr. Steve, thanks again.  You think you don't have any friends?  They're taking care of you.  We're taking care of you, Joe.  You know that, right?  You guys are my friends.  Where are your friends?  Oh, you're my real friends.  This is as good as it's going to get.  I turn those fucking lights out.  You swing too?  I'm eating turkey chili under fucking hot lights.  You know what I'm eating is disgusting.  What?  I'm trying to do this diet, so I got this egg white omelet with vegetables. 
[02:13:00]  Egg whites suck.  Dude, get the yolk for fuck's sake.  Look, here's a food tip.  Here's a food tip for everybody.  If you ever want to have a crab substitute, eat egg whites with spinach in it.  It tastes like bad crab meat.  That's great.  It's disgusting.  You've got a yolk.  It makes the egg.  Yeah.  It makes the egg.  The only people who eat egg whites are fat people.  I've never seen somebody in shape who eats it.  That's a good point.  A yolk.  Just eat the most blandest part of the egg, and somehow you're going to get some abs. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, throw out the fucking tastiest part that you sop up with the toast and everything.  Yolk.  Yolk rules.  Yeah.  I know.  Just eat the fucking shell while you're at it.  I'll just have the shells.  Yeah, give me an eggshell omelet.  I've heard it's even better than egg whites.  All right.  Why don't we let Bill Burr go?  Billy.  No, come on.  I have nothing to go to.  Don't leave me.  Oh, fuck.  I thought you wanted to go back to bed. 
[02:14:00]  We'll have you for the rest of the morning.  Do you guys realize how much I miss doing this show?  Get back out here.  If you want us to be real for a few seconds, we miss you, Bill.  You've got to move back to New York.  It's time.  Well, what was I?  There was nothing going on there for me.  I know.  He's so entrenched.  Other than doing your show.  Yeah.  You know, Cagney and Lacey went off the air, and I had already done a law and order.  So I didn't know what else to do out there.  I know I wasn't getting on the Sopranos unless they had whack-a-mic-wheat, you know? 
[02:14:30]  True.  No one was left.  Ah, fuck.  Hang around and do the view like Joe does.  Oh, man.  I think that was a shot, Joe.  I think that was a shot.  I think he went right back to giving you a shot.  I think he was calling me a check.  Give each other shit, so I hope he can have something to eat.  Yeah, come on.  Let's go.  Let's get this going.  My egg whites, by the way, are waiting for me.  Those egg whites stink.  You're right.  I'm going back to yolks.  You know what I've thought of about you about 20 times this month? 
[02:15:00]  What's that?  When we worked New Year's, I swear to God, Joe DeRosa fucking stepped off the curb in front  of a truck, and we went, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, and he went like, he did this, whoa, and  he did this cartoony turnaround.  If we weren't there, dude, you were dead.  He had his fucking, he had his, you know, those earbuds, you're jamming your fucking ears.  Yeah.  Like, Joe, I thought you were going to die.  I was like, oh, my God.  My only thought was, is he going to get hit, and he's going to go flying into me. 
[02:15:30]  It's self-preservation.  It's, uh, I, look, I, I, we talked about this the other day.  I have no recollection of the event, but I appreciate that you saved my life, so thank  you.  You know, we had a few cocktails that night.  I stayed nice and safe up on the sidewalk.  I just went, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.  You know, adding to that, we forgot to tell you, Bill, he fell down again.  Tell us about the first fall there. 
[02:16:00]  He fell, you didn't tell him you fell in the shower like you're 80 years old?  No, I haven't told him.  You're too scared to tell Bill, right?  No, I'm not too scared to tell anybody.  Slipped in the shower, I fell down.  You know, what are you going to do?  I don't think that's crazy.  And now he just fell down the...  Did you break your hip?  Yeah.  And then he gets mad because he says he's 34 today, and it was an honest moment.  I go, holy shit, I thought you were our age.  And he got all mad at me.  But I'm like, but it's based on the fact that you're falling in your bathtub.  You're falling just walking down stairs.  I just had...  I assumed you had to be older. 
[02:16:30]  Joe, are you going to have to get, like, those big, like, you know, those old people bathtubs  where they have those bars and shit?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We did all this.  We did it.  But Ann came up with a...  Stand-up shower that you sit down in?  Yeah.  But Ann came up with a good one.  I didn't even know they have doors now.  Yeah, the ones you could just walk into.  And then you shut the door, and it's like a submarine door where you twist it, and it  becomes watertight.  And then you could fill it up with water.  And then you drain it out, open the door, and walk right out. 
[02:17:00]  That's for old people that can't step over the one-and-a-half-foot lip that is a bathtub.  Jesus Christ.  I've got to tell you guys, that's why, you know, at some point, you've got to give in  to doing yoga.  Yeah?  I swear to God.  Now you've got to.  Oh, my God.  Joe, what did I tell you?  I told Joe we need to do some Cobras today, Bill.  Why not just lifting?  Why don't you move out to L.A.?  No, because I would fit in out there.  You would?  I would fit out.  I would do well in L.A.  You would.  Like, you have just that perfect disconnected from people vibe, you know? 
[02:17:30]  You would do all right out there.  I love how you call it a vibe.  This is my favorite argument.  Go ahead, Joe.  Let's hear about how real you are.  Yeah.  And how you're not phony on any level.  Come on, Mr. Showbiz.  Bill, and Bill, I'm just too scared to talk about yoga on this show, but it's amazing.  It really is.  Is it?  But I still lift weights, though, Joe, as well.  Yeah?  You like doing yoga in your little leotard, you queer? 
[02:18:00]  Who says you have to wear a leotard?  I don't have to wear a leotard.  He doesn't have to.  He chooses to.  I chooses to wear the leotard.  You've got to wear the leotard.  It holds your queefs in while you're stretching, you fucking faggot.  Well, you know what?  A lot of gas is passed in a yoga class.  Hey.  You pushed that body.  Did you know how well that rhymed?  What?  A lot of gas is passed in the yoga class.  Nice.  Yeah, it was good.  I'm good at rhyming.  Nice.  I've got to write that down on my resume.  Hey.  What, Bill? 
[02:18:30]  If you want to see something hilarious, watch Joe do like six push-ups.  It's one of the funniest things you'll ever do.  We did once, didn't we?  No, and you never will.  He's the only guy I've ever seen.  Oh, yeah?  Turn on the lights.  Opie, there's no way I'm doing this.  Why?  A hundred bucks.  Save the effort of taking your camera out.  Bill, can he do ten for a hundred bucks?  I easily do ten for a hundred bucks.  His arms shake on the first one.  Come on.  In the starting position, his arms start shaking, and there's something seriously wrong with Joe's torso. 
[02:19:00]  I don't know what it is.  Put the hundred in my pocket.  I'll do six.  I'll do ten.  Excuse me.  Twenty for a hundred.  Joe has the same torso as the tin man.  Twenty for a hundred.  He has like that perfectly.  His stomach and his chest are the same roundness.  Bill, am I going to lose a hundred today?  Can he do twenty?  Twenty for a hundred, but you can't videotape it.  Twenty?  No.  No, fuck you. 
[02:19:30]  Why?  Fuck you, Joe.  Fuck you.  Why can't I videotape it?  Why get so aggressive?  I should have thrown that drink on you.  Because I'm the one that's going to get shit on all the internet for it.  So?  Danny, got some input here?  Yeah, you know what?  Do you know what this is?  This is like Joe won the Oscar and now he doesn't want to hype the movie.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, no it's not.  Get on the goddamn floor.  Do your fucking push-up.  I said...  Why don't you want it on the internet?  Three more tickets, Joe.  Everybody's got to whore themselves out in this business and it's your turn. 
[02:20:00]  I said I would do it.  I just don't want the viral video of it.  That's all.  Because I'm going to get...  Why would I openly invite a trashing online?  Why would I do that?  Why are you acting like you sell your own line of juicers on the internet?  This is going to ruin your reputation.  Yeah, exactly.  It's you doing dumb push-ups.  It'll probably sell tickets.  Hey, Bill, do you remember during a taping of Uninformed Ones?  We got around to this whole push-up business with DeRosa.  And I think there was... 
[02:20:30]  I do remember Joe getting so upset that by the end of the taping,  you guys weren't even talking down the elevator.  Oh, no.  And then I remember I got a great...  No, no, no.  Danny, that was every episode.  I remember this one in...  One time, me and Joe argued on the way to the studio.  We were just screaming at each other.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's back when I had the same kind of friendship arc that I had with Bobby Kelly  where I never argue with Bobby anymore because we know each other so well that we can see 
[02:21:00]  it coming.  We just sort of veer away.  And I've gotten to that point with Joe DeRosa.  As much as I hate him, I don't flip out at him anymore.  I hate him.  This fight was pretty nice, though, because I remember I got a voicemail the next day  from Joe being all apologetic.  He's like, hey, man, sorry, bro.  Sorry I flipped out about the push-ups thing, you know.  It was one of those messages I really wanted to say for a long time, and I'm really upset. 
[02:21:30]  I forgot to say it.  I wish you would have said it.  I would love to hear that.  Joe, how about...  That was old Joe.  Old Joe didn't know how to take a pounding.  He used to take it seriously.  Like, we...  I know it's funny.  The truth was actually worse than what he thought.  It's like, Joe, we actually don't give a shit about you enough to make this serious.  I look.  I got $100, but I got to film it.  Joe, that's $100, Joe.  $100.  Think of all the comic books that you can watch under your teeth lamp. 
[02:22:00]  I'm happy to do the bet.  I just don't want the goddamn online trashing I'm going to get for videotaping myself  doing fucking push-ups.  What if we put a bag on your head so that, in the end...  No!  They don't really know it's you.  You're going to write that it's me.  Well, yeah, but they...  Now it's you with a bag on your head.  Come on, do it with a bag on your head.  Put that black line across his eyes so nobody knows who it is.  Well, they're going to know it's him from his shoulders, though.  Like the picture of the person with measles in those medical books. 
[02:22:30]  Right.  They put the black bar over their eyes.  How bad?  How bad of a trashing do you think?  You know what?  The trashing probably won't even be that bad.  What are we talking about?  You guys put...  Ridiculous.  You put up the videos of Jimmy getting hit and stuff like that.  It won't be that much worse.  It's the same type of video.  That's true.  We can alter your voice if you want to.  Look at the fucking deceit in your eyes.  What?  Look at the deceit.  Well, that's why we need these lights off.  You literally look like a guy saying to a chick, just come on, let's fuck me.  I love you, baby.  Like you had the same fucking look in your eyes.  Well, all right.  If the lights weren't so bright in here, you wouldn't have been able to tell. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, my God.  You are just...  I don't like where people can read my eyes.  Yeah.  Come on.  I got up at 5 a.m.  Opie and Anthony were nice enough to create the show.  Everybody's pulling their weight here except you.  That's a really good point.  Bill, that's a really good point.  If Opie and Anthony never got together, I wouldn't have had a show to call into.  Do you think I wanted to get up at 5 a.m.?  It was out of respect for those two.  It was out of respect.  Why don't you show a little bit of respect and give them that little viral video because 
[02:23:30]  you're going to sell more tickets next time you're going to have to do a laptop.  You will sell more tickets, John.  Opie, you're lying.  The videos have shown that ticket sales do go up.  I've got to ask Bill.  I've done like eight videos with you.  Bill, are you...  Ticket sales the same.  Hey, Bill, what time did the party end last night?  It was actually two nights ago.  Yesterday was like three in the morning.  Oh, okay.  No, I thought you...  It was hilarious.  I was a little bit drunk and there was one chick who was hanging around who wasn't going 
[02:24:00]  home.  So I immediately thought like, oh my God, is the three-way going to go down?  The only person who's up at that hour is your dick.  So it's all saying shit like that.  Here we go.  It's going to happen.  That's great.  That's hilarious.  Joe, are we doing this?  Come on, Joe.  All right.  Ten on video.  A hundred bucks.  Ten.  For me and our phony friendship, could you please...  You know what?  Come on.  You got to meet me.  There's got to be some give here.  I can't just do everything you guys are saying.  Here's the deal.  Yeah.  If the video doesn't look impressive, then you don't get the hundred. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, man.  This guy...  What if he just pull...  What if he does ten boring push-ups?  No.  Then that's the gamble you got to take.  That was the bet.  You said...  I'm counting on Bill Burr.  Bill's saying I can't even do three.  So...  Bill?  Yeah.  Opie, I got it.  This is how it works.  Yeah.  All right.  For every one he does regular, okay, he gets credit for one.  All right?  But we all know he's going to conk out before he gets to 20.  So at that point, he can actually do the ones where you put your knees on the ground  and then you keep going. 
[02:25:00]  But he's got to do two for every one he has left.  So if he does 12 and he's got eight left, if he wants to make the hundred, he's got to  do another 16.  Oh, you've got to do 20 push-ups.  What does this turn into?  No.  It's ten push-ups for a hundred bucks.  That was the initial bet.  All right.  Bring Mars in here, though.  They're official push-ups.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Let's set up the microphones.  Ten's not a funny number.  You've got to get your...  Funny enough for me.  Let's do it.  All right.  Hold on.  Now...  The whole bit is all about you not... 
[02:25:30]  Which mic is that, Sam?  Seven.  Well, he thinks he's going to do it and pocket the hundred, so...  All right.  I need to show him a push-up first.  Oh, yeah?  No, no.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Before it goes, renegotiation.  Renegotiation.  It's got to be...  It's got to be...  If you go for the 20...  You're going to bend your elbows until you almost close the floor and come back up.  And you make it...  I'll throw in a hundred, too.  Oh, oh.  Renegotiation.  If you go for the 20, Bill says he's throwing in another hundred.  With the legs?  Okay.  Okay. 
[02:26:00]  You're taking it?  If I go for the 20.  But all I've got to do is the 10 for the initial hundred.  No.  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  He says no.  That's the best.  He says 20 for 200 now.  No, but I'm saying...  But if I do 10, I get the original hundred.  He's saying no.  No.  I'm not taking that.  It's 10 for the hundred.  Then he's not taking it.  He wants 10 for a hundred.  Where's that?  Make it 300.  Whoa.  Oh, he just said 300.  Dr. Steve.  I'm in for a hundred.  If you do 20...  100 for me, 100 for Burr.  300 for 20, but you've got to do the 20. 
[02:26:30]  I'll never see this money, first of all.  What, is Dr. Steve going to mail me a check?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because when you cock out, you can then do the rest on your knees.  You've just got to go two for one at that point.  There's no way you're not going to make this money.  I don't understand the two for one thing.  I don't get that.  I'm taking the girl push-ups out of the equation.  No girl push-ups.  Opie doesn't want the girl push-ups.  If you do 20 real push-ups, it means what?  $300.  $300.  But if you do 10, you don't get anything.  But I get 100 cash now. 
[02:27:00]  For what?  From you.  For doing what?  For the fucking push-ups.  It's 100 guys each.  No.  No, no, no.  No.  You don't get shit from me until you do 20.  It's 300 bucks for 20.  No, I'm saying if I do the 20 for 300, I get 100 cash today.  Oh, right, right.  Two checks in the mail.  Right, right.  Yeah, I guess.  No.  It's got to be that.  All right.  Fair enough.  Is he going to be good on the bet?  I don't know.  He might.  Put the cash out.  Fuck you, Joe.  I'm good.  Oh, damn.  I'm good for it.  He's serious.  He put a serious fuck you face on. 
[02:27:30]  Don't insult me.  Don't insult me.  What are you doing?  I'm strangling myself with the headphones.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Can we still have him do the girl push-ups in the end?  Joe, the other way.  He doesn't want to.  I want to get in on film here, too.  He doesn't want to do that.  Do what?  The girl push-ups.  No girl push-ups.  What's the bet, Ant?  The bet is you have to do 20 push-ups.  You get 300 bucks.  You do 19 push-ups and cannot do one more.  You get nothing. 
[02:28:00]  I just want to do the 10 for 100.  No, now it's up to 20.  I didn't agree to it yet.  20 for 300.  I didn't agree to this yet.  No?  No.  What are you going to agree to?  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Bill wants to talk to you, Joe.  Bill wants to talk to you.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  He's putting his headphones on.  Hold on.  And you got him.  Yes.  Joe, if you agree to the girl push-ups, you're going to make it.  Because what happens is you're going to come up.  But Opie's saying we can't do that.  Opie's saying no to that.  Bill, for $300, no girl push-ups. 
[02:28:30]  No, no.  This is for Opie.  He's got to do two to one with the girl one.  So if he does...  I don't even think he can do 10.  Let's say he does 12.  He's got eight left.  Then he's down on his knees.  He's got to do 16 more.  What happened?  And the girl stands.  I understand what he means.  I think we just need to make it a basic bet, because now it's getting a little confusing.  Yeah, I'm confused.  Why can't we just do the 10 for $100?  Alabama's confused.  10 for $100?  It turned into 20 for $300.  You guys just decided that after we already agreed on it. 
[02:29:00]  It's more economical.  Dude, you can't...  My back hurts so bad right now that I'm not going to make it.  But think, $300.  Hence why I thought you were older than 34.  Oh, I'm a rich girl.  What the fuck am I going to do with $300?  Buy dinner twice?  It's now.  A fucking $100 for $10.  Time out, time out, time out.  Did Joe just act like he drops $150 every night for dinner?  Yes.  Yes.  He's a high roller.  Sorry, I thought exaggeration was part of a joke. 
[02:29:30]  I was just making a fucking joke.  Jesus Christ.  Really?  He goes, really?  Recognize it.  Can we just do $300 for 20 push-ups?  Anyone in this room can do 20 push-ups.  Well, Sam can't.  I was like, Sam.  You can't do 20.  For $300, I can.  You can?  Mm-mm.  Joe, $300 for 20 fucking guy...  Is he doing it?  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, wait a minute.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, he's going to do it.  He just got into this in one.  Hold on, hold on, I'm going to start again. 
[02:30:00]  Hold on, I'm waiting for my camera to start up.  You can't lay on the floor in between push-ups.  I didn't start yet.  All right, go, Joe.  This is the bet.  20 push-ups for $300.  All right?  Ready?  Yes.  And go.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, 11,  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 
[02:30:30]  20, 23, 21.  Yes?  What happened to the chest hitting the floor?  Mars judged it.  I did 20.  I get the money.  That's it.  I was set up by Bill Burr.  There we go.  300.  A hundred bucks.  All right.  Righteous.  And a shitty video. 
[02:31:00]  Well.  And a shitty video on top of it.  Bill Burr sent me up.  Yeah, we got set up.  Wait a minute.  He did it?  Yeah, he did it.  He did it.  No problem.  And Mars judged it.  He said it counted.  I didn't stop until Mars said we were good.  No girl push-ups, no nothing.  He did it.  Dude, the floor wasn't even that bad, so I just lost a hundred bucks.  I lost a hundred.  Well, fucking Mars, you got to talk to, because Joe's chest never even hit the floor.  Mars doesn't have to.  What do you mean he doesn't have to?  He didn't touch the floor when he did his example push-ups. 
[02:31:30]  He doesn't have to.  The plane has to break.  Wait a minute.  How far down did he go?  I was bending my arms fully, keeping my back straight.  Mars judged it.  He was easily six inches from the floor, and Mars is calling that an official push-ups.  I did extras to make up for the three that you said didn't count.  I went up to 23.  I would say all of them didn't count.  Oh, listen to the Nancy's, angry that they lost a bet.  Everybody's complaining now.  They got to cough up the money.  Notice I didn't get in on that.  I have faith in you, DeRosa.  I'm suspicious that Bill Burr set us up. 
[02:32:00]  I'm stunned.  I'm not bitching, you asshole.  I'm joking.  Bill, I'm just joking.  Jesus.  For all the joking going around, there's so many angry people.  Well, I'm angry because I lost a hundred dollars.  I didn't even get a good video out of it.  So did Bill and Steve.  The video sucks.  I'm not posting that.  It's just a guy doing push-ups.  It's a guy.  Hope he didn't get a good video.  Hope he didn't get a good video.  See, Bill's covering because I think Bill set us up.  The push-up didn't even look that bad.  Hope he fell for a classic short story. 
[02:32:30]  Hope he fell for a classic short story.  Do you really think I would ever do anything to help Joe DeRosa?  No.  Well, that's why I'm confused.  That's a good point.  That's true.  But those push-ups didn't look that bad, right, Mars?  No, they did not.  Fucking Bill said that he would be shaking and all that.  It would look good.  Thank you, Mars.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  We still have the old footage for uninformed Joe DeRosa from five years ago.  I mean, he could barely do like five.  If you've been working out.  Here's your hundred.  Look at this.  Minus my cut.  Minus my cut.  Are you kidding? 
[02:33:00]  What?  Eighty bucks.  No!  The bet was a hundred minus my cut.  No!  What's your cut?  But you're the one paying.  Twenty percent.  That's my cut.  Remember how mad you got when I said, are you going to come clean?  You said, don't doubt my word.  I'm going to come clean on this.  It's a hundred dollar bet.  Minus my cut.  What's your cut for?  Just for being me.  Jesus.  It's show business.  This is how it goes.  He knows.  Bill knows.  It's twenty percent.  Bill, you'll be mailing the check, I assume?  Fuck. 
[02:33:30]  I have to give out.  There's your cut.  I'm going to mail you a check for a hundred bucks.  I'm going to be in New York in two weeks.  Two weeks?  Well, that means we've got to hang out there.  The juice is running today.  Two weeks.  We've got to hang out.  I'll tell you right now.  I'll see you in two weeks.  How about you, man?  I didn't know you could do that.  Are you finally starting to work out?  Because I know you and Bobby always traipsing around the neighborhood and get all giddy every  time some new heart attack restaurant opens up.  Dude, you've got to go, dude. 
[02:34:00]  They put chocolate on the chicken, dude.  Are you really taking my hundred?  Yeah.  Of course.  You don't take the money?  Of course I'm taking the money.  How crazy you are.  You bet.  You do it.  Give him his goddamn money.  I gave him the money, but I should put the video online just to prove that Mars was in  on this.  No, I wasn't.  But you shouldn't take the money.  It's all for the show.  No, it's fine.  It's for the show.  No.  Mars, are you nuts?  These motherfuckers wanted to mock me.  If Obi could have this video up with graphics going, look at this fucking queer, he would. 
[02:34:30]  There's literally nothing there to post, but I think Mars fucked us all by...  I always learned it's chest to the floor.  That's not true.  You don't have to touch the floor with a chest.  That's weird.  Yeah.  Chest to the floor.  I only have to.  You're way bent back.  As long as you're 90 degrees.  That's what they tell you.  Don't tell me what working out is all about, Joe.  As long as your elbows are 90 degrees.  First push-ups in 10 years, he's going to tell me how to work out.  90 degrees at the elbows, and you're good.  What the fuck?  Yes, Bill. 
[02:35:00]  You know what's really going to devastate Joe is when you put that up there, and despite  the fact that he succeeded, your fans still trash him.  Oh, they won't, Joe.  No shit.  I'm still going to get trashed.  Absolutely.  Maybe I'll make something out of it.  I don't know.  Fuck.  All right.  Jesus, Joe.  You probably could do more push-ups than Opie.  Opie, can you do 24?  In my sleep.  Yeah, you look like you're in good shape, Opie.  I could probably push out 50 to 60 right now.  I got a side bet with Mars.  I'm not ready to take it yet. 
[02:35:30]  I'm challenging Mars soon.  Oh, yeah?  Yes, Bill.  Head to head?  Head to head.  Opie, I was trying to get you your money back.  You were supposed to say I haven't been working out.  You weren't supposed to go back.  All right.  What if I could do 60 right now?  Will you give me my 100 back?  No.  Why?  I don't want to bet.  I'm done.  I'll put another 100 on the line.  No.  I absolutely believe you could do 60.  I don't even know, to be honest with you.  You should have taken that bet.  Joe, are you on your mind?  He's going to do 60 good ones?  Yeah, 50 would be...  Anything over 50 would be amazing.  You should have taken that bet. 
[02:36:00]  I've seen Keith Robinson do 75 push-ups.  Oh, he's black.  And they got an extra muscle.  Can we just time out here?  How much of a pussy is Joe being that he won't even let you try to win?  I love that if you don't give a guy a chance to win his money back, you're the asshole.  It's like, no.  You lost.  I got it.  I'm leaving.  That's old school.  That's old neighborhood shit.  Is it?  Yeah, you let the guy get a chance getting his money back.  As Bill said, I come from a cul-de-sac like a little bitch.  I don't know old neighborhood shit.  Oh, shit.  Bit you back in the ass. 
[02:36:30]  I won a couple hands.  I'm getting up from the table.  I'm going to the fucking bar.  That's it.  This is done.  Joe, you didn't win a couple hands.  You showed up.  You won one hand.  Took everybody's money.  And now, this is how you get shot in the Old West.  With one hand of poker.  All right there, Ulysses.  We'll see you later.  You want me to force Kenny to make you make that bet?  No.  Why would you do that?  Why not?  You know how dumb you are.  You understand?  Now, Opie's going to get on the ground.  And whether he can do them or not, he's a redhead like me. 
[02:37:00]  So his face is going to be the color of a fucking tomato.  So eight in, and everyone would have made fun of him.  And you're blowing it.  You're blowing it.  Bet's off the table.  Oh, you want to take it off the table?  I don't know if I can do 60.  You want to take it off the table?  I know I can do 50.  60?  You should have taken that bet.  You would have walked away with another 100.  Look, I'm still getting the two bills from Bill and old Dr. Steve there.  I'll bet this 100 that I got in my pocket.  There you go.  No, I'll take it.  Playing with the house, there's money. 
[02:37:30]  No, now I go for the 300.  Don't be paying them out.  Now I go for the 300.  Not for my 300.  Yeah.  You just made 300.  I'll bet you 300.  Take the bet.  Fuck you, Mars.  Make him do the 50 nonstop.  I'll throw 100 in if he does 60.  60 nonstop.  Nonstop.  Nonstop.  No rest.  You want to take that bet?  Fuck you, Mars.  What the fuck?  Mars fucked me once. 
[02:38:00]  I was trying to fuck me twice.  That wasn't a real push-up.  I noticed you got an interesting gambling style to you.  What's that?  Stupidity?  You'll bet.  Don't go out of shit.  And then when something's against you, you go, fuck you.  You get angry.  No, because Mars knows.  He doesn't want any gamble in the gambling.  Yeah.  Well, Mars knows 60's going to be really tough.  It's going to be awful.  What did I do the last time?  50?  You did over 50, right?  Yeah, but I don't think I hit 60.  I know I could do 50. 
[02:38:30]  But nonstop.  Yeah, well, of course nonstop.  How about 50 nonstop for $300?  No, no.  Because I believe you can do that.  60.  52.  65.  52.  60, 65.  I've got to think this one over.  No, I...  No, you don't.  Come on, Opie.  Show Joe what a real man does.  Just bang out 60, get your money back, and go right back to your breakfast.  Come on.  You did more than 50 last time. 
[02:39:00]  Well, then 60's too low a number.  You did more than 50 last time.  Oh, really, Joe?  No, no, no.  You bet 60.  Well, if he's saying...  Hold on a second.  My bet changed eight fucking times before I got on the ground.  How do you know I'm not bluffing this entire time, and I could easily do 60?  I don't even want to take the bet.  Why?  I made $100.  Why?  I got another two coming.  I'm happy.  It was a good fucking day.  I don't want to bet anymore.  Oh, you're going to have to bet.  You're going to have to bet.  I'm going to go buy some new shoes with this money.  Joe, what's funny about you is you're so into the Rat Pack and all that type of shit, 
[02:39:30]  but if everybody gambled like you, Vegas would have gone out of business.  If I want my $40, I can go buy some high C.  I'm just going to go tonight.  I'm thinking I'm going to let Joe be the hero today.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I think so.  Come on, Anthony.  Applaud for that.  The big winner.  Yeah.  Who's the big winner here today?  Joe DeRosa.  Or let me take a leak first.  What?  I got a pig. 
[02:40:00]  Badly.  You really like a nice, casual, calm betting environment for yourself.  When you're on the other side of that table, dog, you're fucking lighting fire.  It's all he is.  Fucking asshole.  Everything's got to be perfect.  And then I'll take the bet.  Jesus Christ, dude.  I'm going to call you Ace Rothstein.  I think he's bluffing, Joe.  Oh, fuck.  Now.  That's why he's trying to get out of the bet.  You know what?  I'm out of the bet.  I'm out.  I don't want to do it anymore.  That's all.  Why?  Joe's pulled out now.  I pulled out.  I'm pulling out.  You sure?  Yeah, because you've filled my head with so much. 
[02:40:30]  I don't know who to fucking believe right now.  It would have been easy money, Joe.  This is like the departed.  I don't know who's telling the truth or what.  Huh?  No matter what, you've still got $200.  And now that I know I can go halfway down for a real push-up, I'm good.  Let's do this, Joe.  Bill, I'm back in.  Bill, I just realized that last time I did over the 50, I was hitting chest.  I'll do it your pussy way right now.  Let's go.  $300.  See, Bill, he wants my $300. 
[02:41:00]  He doesn't want the $100.  And I'm saying, no, that's a bad bet because I believe that you can do it.  That's the problem.  I believe you can do the 60.  I forgot that I could do pussy push-ups.  How about $200?  Let's do this.  Do it for $200.  $200.  Why wasn't it $100?  No, I'm going to take my $100 back and I'm going to take a new $100 from Joe DeRosa.  Oh, man.  You got $100 on you?  It's a bad bet.  I just realized.  This is a bad bet.  I didn't realize I could do the pussy push-ups.  This is a bad bet.  Why is Joe actually trying to make money in this rather than just have fun? 
[02:41:30]  It's a bad bet.  I'm not trying to make money.  I didn't know it's a bad bet.  Because I believe.  This could be a poker face.  Maybe I can't do 50.  Let me tell you a story.  My father told me once that a man will come to you one day in life and tell you, I can make  a man jump out of this book and squirt cider in your ear.  Do not take that bet.  Because sure enough, son, you will end up with an ear full of cider.  Cider?  Cider?  That's from Guys and Dolls.  Well, that's, uh, yeah.  You know what?  Words of wisdom right there.  This is a bad bet. 
[02:42:00]  I forgot I could do pussy push-ups.  It's not about the bet, you moron.  It's about watching Opie's head turn red.  Yeah, but I took the bet because I thought Joe was going to look ridiculous.  He didn't look that bad.  Well, that's the thing.  And I don't think you're going to look ridiculous either.  And I risk public humiliation to win this money.  I won.  I don't think you're going to look ridiculous.  I think you're going to bang these out.  I don't think your face is going to get that red.  And I think that's going to be the end of it.  All I have to do is go halfway down like he did?  This is terrible.  Bullshit.  His father left him at an orphanage. 
[02:42:30]  Who?  Me?  Oh, yeah.  No.  That isn't even nice.  It wasn't an orphanage.  It was a doorstep.  Thank you.  Oh, okay.  With strangers.  Yeah, I guess a lot of people saying that was a pussy push-up, Mars.  You let a lot of people down today.  They didn't see it.  He said, Mars said, your chest has to almost touch the floor.  It wasn't even close to almost.  And then it wasn't close.  You just got to make 90 degrees of your arms, guys.  He said.  How far away was Joe from the floor?  Six to eight inches.  Oh, stop it. 
[02:43:00]  I was watching.  I swear to God you were.  Oh, stop it.  Stop it, fellas.  I was doing real push-ups.  Why don't you guys look it up on the president's physical fitness thing?  Why don't you guys look it up on the president's physical fitness thing?  Because when Mars set it up, he said, you have to do it like this.  Your chest has to almost touch the floor.  Right.  But it doesn't have to touch the floor.  Six to eight inches is not even close to touching the floor.  But he makes 90 degrees of his up.  The bat's been made and paid.  Look how far away from the floor he is. 
[02:43:30]  It's insane.  Arguing now is ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  It's not 90 degrees.  And it's not even 90 degrees.  Yeah, you're right.  Mars, you fucked me today.  Mars will always say yes to a push-up.  He did the same thing.  Look, none of these are 90 degrees.  Do you want me to do 10 more?  Bad official call.  Do you want me to do 10 more?  See, well, maybe if I had your telephone number, maybe I could count a little better.  Oh, wow.  A little payback for the diss, Opie.  Do you want me to do 10 more?  Oh, DeRosa's not willing to do 10.  You weren't even close to 90 degrees.  Even Ant said.  Do you want me to do 10 more? 
[02:44:00]  10 more to keep the money.  Your drinking partner even fucking called you out.  You're not even close to 90 degrees.  I'm not going to pay him, Ben.  Straight back.  Oh, shit.  Bill, you shouldn't pay him.  Bill's saying he's not paying him.  And I want my 100 back right now.  Wait.  This is still, this is, the jury's still out on this.  The jury's still out on this.  Even Ant said you weren't 90 degrees.  Well, I said he didn't go 90 degrees, but the official did give him credit, and the bet's  been paid, so, you know, they don't call back all those bad plays at the official.  I'll do 10 more for good faith.  I'm serious.  That's not good faith. 
[02:44:30]  10 more to keep the 100.  I'll do 10 more.  10 more, but nothing at risk, right?  10 more, you just did 24 pussy ones.  You had a half hour break.  Are you really going to hang out 10 more?  They weren't pussy push-ups.  God, I love Bill Burr.  The fucking, it's, I don't, like, those were push-ups.  No.  Where's Kenny?  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you.  Some reasoning has entered the studio, believe it or not.  Kenny walked in.  What are you talking about?  If Sam was doing his job, he would have Googled how to do a proper push-up.  Ah, shit. 
[02:45:00]  You're right.  Joe, my $100 is coming back to me.  Bring it around.  It says that your chest should almost graze the ground about an inch from the floor.  Which is what Mars said.  Kenny, come over here.  But then Mars changed his mind at the end.  Kenny, come over here.  You tell me if this is legal push-ups.  Oh, boy.  This is bad now.  Now you're going to feel really weird keeping my $100.  The fans will fucking kill you over that one.  Tell me if these are legal push-ups.  Ant said no, too.  Oh, boy. 
[02:45:30]  Kenny's about to, here we go.  This is like the OJ verdict.  Right.  Yeah.  Kenny's not even going all the way down, Joe.  I don't like him.  Kenny doesn't like him.  You've got to give me my $100 to push-up.  Wait a second.  Look, I'll give the money back.  I don't have a problem with that.  If you're a man, you give me my money back.  Really?  Is manhood?  Really?  Bill?  Reneging on a bet isn't man?  Is manly?  That's manly?  Bill, I just saved you $100.  Do you go and complain to the pit boss when you lose at blackjack? 
[02:46:00]  They didn't deal it fair.  Yeah, but if you were playing blackjack, you know, 17 fucking wins.  Here's the thing, though.  Every time.  You let Mars, look at that right there.  They're not down.  Look at this.  Wait.  Look how far that guy is from the fucking ground.  That's because he's up.  Because he's up.  He hasn't started a push-up yet.  No, that's up.  You put the video up.  That's down.  That's two different push-up styles.  Well, his arms aren't bent.  If I put this video up, you're going to get killed. 
[02:46:30]  Listen to me.  And you will be giving me my $100 back.  Because you're going to have a lot of guilt when you're alone in your apartment with your winter depression.  I got no problem giving the money back.  Give the money back.  But you said Mars is calling it, and you let him call it.  Now that you don't like his call, you're saying, no, his call is bullshit.  That's all I'm saying.  Mars is a big disappointment today.  The official bottom position.  At minimum, you must go down onto the inside portion of your elbows are 90 degrees.  But there was no 90.  Even Ant said no 90 degrees.  I saw 90 degrees. 
[02:47:00]  At my angle, I saw 90 degrees.  Are you going to take Ant's word for it?  He says your 90 degrees wasn't happening.  He said I was 90 degrees.  I'm not saying it should be overturned.  I'm saying what I saw in the video was not 90 degrees.  But you entrusted Mars with being the official in this whole thing.  He said it was good.  That's true.  And you've got to go with the official.  How about this?  That's true.  How about this?  I go back down.  That part is true.  How about this?  Kenny, hold on.  We challenged.  We went to the videotape.  Oh, no.  Oh, we did.  Well, we never said the rules.  How about this?  I said NFL rules.  You did not go that far.  I said NFL rules. 
[02:47:30]  Nobody does that when they do push-ups.  I didn't see a red flag.  Nobody puts their nose to the fucking floor.  That's what I do.  I do.  A real man makes sure his fucking nose hits the floor.  A real man again.  When did you become an authority on push-ups?  Because you finally did over 20?  No, because I worked with a trainer at the gym for a few sessions.  He didn't do them like that either.  Why don't you give me my 100 back so we can all calm down?  And then we'll try to figure this out like men.  Let me do 10 again with Kenny watching from the floor angle.  And if he still has a problem, then it's open for discussion. 
[02:48:00]  Why is it 10 when the bet was 20?  I'm saying so he could just see for fucking form.  No.  He saw the form on the video that I made.  You're shooting from above.  I don't think that's accurate.  I was pretty close to the floor.  No, you weren't.  You were standing over me.  We get Sam to lay underneath Joe.  And you got to kiss Sam on the lips.  You got to like...  And that'll be an official push-up.  I'm very serious.  I will put the $100 right here.  Let Kenny judge again on form. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, Jesus.  That's fair.  No, you know what?  Give me another $100 to shut the fuck up.  Oh, damn.  You better give me the $100 back.  I don't even care anymore.  You're going to be humiliated if I put this video up.  Why would I be humiliated?  Bill.  I got a new deal I want to make.  A new deal?  Oh, great.  You gave me my $100 back.  I don't put the video up.  And everything's good.  If you don't give me the fucking $100, I put the video up.  That's extortion.  And you will be humiliated.  Because people will see that you cheated for the $100.  Yeah.  It's your choice, Joe. 
[02:49:00]  No, I didn't cheat.  It's your choice.  All right.  Then you want to keep it as it is.  Do you want to keep it as it is?  You guys plan this.  I will put the video up.  This is the evil of you.  Is you have this bet set up in a way where there's no way I could win.  It's the Kobayashi Maru.  No matter what I did, I couldn't win.  Your fucking Kaiser Sose, you had this covered from every fucking angle.  There was no way for me to win this.  You got a choice.  I got the video.  You can keep my $100.  I'll put the video up.  And then you're going to be humiliated.  You give me the $100 back.  I'm getting another $200, too. 
[02:49:30]  I will erase the video.  That's true.  It's $300.  I will erase the video right in front of you if you give me the $100 back.  Or be humiliated.  I don't believe that you're even doing.  I don't believe you're even doing it.  I'll hand my camera you on your belief.  You know what this sounds like?  Desperation.  Yeah.  How about we just do it again?  Fair enough.  How about we just do it again?  Video goes up after the show.  How about we do it again with a new officiator?  We'll play it by your rules.  How about we do it again with a new officiator?  Fair enough.  No.  That was my bet.  That wasn't a bet.  That was my bet.  That's extortion.  Do you know what bet means?  That's my bet.  That's my bet. 
[02:50:00]  That was blackmail.  You wanted $100 in blackmail money.  Do you want this video online for people to decide if you legitimately won my money?  I don't want money for nothing.  I want Kenny to judge again.  I took a bet.  And your judge that you appointed said it was official.  Bill, what do you think?  That's true.  I think that was more than fair.  He gives me the $100 back.  I erase the video and no one sees the video.  Or he keeps my money and takes the chance that the push-ups were not legal. 
[02:50:30]  And then you're going to be humiliated.  Your judge that you appointed said they were legal push-ups.  So it doesn't matter whether they are or not.  The judge said they were.  And I agree on good faith.  Hold on.  We're past that.  You get to keep the $100 right now.  Because Ant made a great point.  I picked a dope to fucking judge the contest.  So you're right.  Kenny didn't judge it.  So you're right.  So you're right.  Officially, you won the bet.  Because the guy I chose to judge said you did it fair.  Legal.  But here's the side bet.  You give me back the $100. 
[02:51:00]  We erase the video.  That's not a bet.  Or you keep the $100.  I put the video online and then let the listeners decide if Mars was in on this.  But that's not a bet.  Oh, yeah.  Mars was in on it.  You were the one that insisted Mars judge it.  Video goes up in a couple hours.  Fair enough.  I hate to think that that's the way you do business.  Fair enough.  But, you know, what are you going to do?  I wasn't going to put the video up.  But you leave me no choice.  Yeah, you were.  You were going to put the video up either way.  Now this shitty video is going to be seen by a lot of people. 
[02:51:30]  You even said.  This shitty video.  And I want the people that comment on this video to give me their background.  Like I was a Marine.  I tried out for Navy SEALs.  Okay.  I'm a karate guy.  I'm just some schmuck.  Whatever it is.  Okay.  And I want the people that comment on this video to remember.  And I quote.  Opie walking away with the camera going.  That's not even a good video.  You just did it.  It's a shitty video.  I wasn't going to put it online.  But now because you won't give me the $100 back.  I put the video online.  But remember when you said that. 
[02:52:00]  When you went.  And remember how this all started.  You didn't want to film because you didn't want to be humiliated.  Well.  I did my duty.  You know what I feel like right now.  Yeah.  I feel like when.  When I'm dumb enough to bet on a football team the first week of the season.  And then you discover like.  Oh fuck.  The Lions are going to be good this year.  So it's a different.  They're just doing that.  Also those are different push-ups.  Those are these push-ups.  We were doing these.  Those are two different kinds of push-ups.  You don't even know there's a different kind of push-up.  I absolutely know that.  I absolutely know that.  You know boy push-ups and girl push-ups. 
[02:52:30]  They're doing inside arm push-ups.  What do the fuck you call it?  We were doing these.  And someone's asking.  Why would I pay if I'm questioning the push-up?  Because I picked stupid Mars.  You insisted it be Mars.  I made a good point there.  I can't.  He was the official.  You insisted.  But now I'm going to.  I'm going to take it to the fucking listeners.  Well.  Are you willing to do this Joe?  When a man has no chest.  Look at that.  Can you really see whether or not it came close to the floor?  That's true.  You don't really have a chest.  So maybe if you had a normal chest. 
[02:53:00]  It would have been.  It would have been.  Impressive.  How about we just do it again?  Do it again.  How about we just do it again?  No.  You're panicking.  I'm good.  I'm not panicking.  I'm good where I sit.  Congratulations.  You won the contest.  You got my $100.  And this video goes online.  I don't want you to.  And the listeners will decide.  And I want them to not assume what I want from this.  I want you to be more than fair.  Yeah.  Is that what you want?  Look at the video and see if Joe legitimately won this bet.  You don't want any biased opinions on this voting?  Nope.  Oh.  Okay.  I'm willing to take that chance.  Why don't we just do it again? 
[02:53:30]  No.  That's the fair thing.  I gave you your choices.  You chose to keep the $100.  You did it.  You tried to blackmail me.  You're giving him choices, which is blackmail.  Yeah.  I gave you choices.  You decided to keep my $100.  And that's fair.  Because it's such a bitch move.  Oh, I'll give you the money back.  Don't post that video.  I'm not fine.  Come on, man.  I'm not a bitch.  I agreed to you videotaping.  All right.  The video will be online.  That's all.  Phil just laughing in the back of my head.  Can he protect my camera?  I don't trust Joe.  Joe says he's not a bitch. 
[02:54:00]  That's just hilarious.  What did he say?  He says it's hilarious listening to you say you're not a bitch.  Thank you.  Joe starts rehearsing his dialogue from some Oz episode.  Joe, I'm not a bitch.  I'm doing this for myself, Dr. Steve, and Bill Burr.  I'm putting the video online.  Because I think you just took a lot of people's money unfairly.  I'm not debating the $100.  Look, this is all about making Joe look like an asshole. 
[02:54:30]  It didn't happen.  So then we moved on to you.  I wanted to see your head turn red on point of number fucking 38.  You said, I think, Joe, what happens here,  the guilt will get to you.  L.P., there's no guilt.  You bet me something.  I think you're going to be giving back my money,  Bill Burr's money, and Dr. Steve's money.  The guilt will get to you.  Steve, don't worry about the $100.  Oh, wow.  Steve, don't worry about it.  You need him for your seasonal depression. 
[02:55:00]  I see what you're doing.  That's fine.  You need some real advice after the show.  I need you in my life as well.  But Steve is not chimed in at all.  Steve has been a perfect gentleman through this whole process.  Look, you know what?  I'll be in your life, Joe.  It'll be a little different after this day.  But I'll still be in your life.  He's like, you're threatening me.  That is a threat, right?  I'll be in your life, Joe.  I'll be in your life.  I'll be in your life.  You'll never forget me.  What about Bill?  You giving him his $100 back yet?  No, because Bill fueled this whole fucking thing. 
[02:55:30]  So far, I got you to give somebody his money back.  I'm not asking, Joe.  I never ask for my $100 back.  That's a good point.  And Bill, thank you for that.  I'm really not.  No, you ask for your $100 back.  You keep the $100.  I'm putting the video in line.  We're all good.  Isn't that semantics?  We're all good.  And you shouldn't be paranoid.  You won the bet, remember?  So the video should come out nice for you.  I'm not paranoid.  What I'm saying is I will gladly do it again  in good faith,  so you don't think I took your money. 
[02:56:00]  But I want it to be on the record, mind you,  that when you walked away,  you expressed disappointment  that I banged out the push-ups  and you didn't get a good video out of it.  I was yelling because Mars was not counting half of them.  Not at first.  I mean, he was counting bad push-ups.  Not at first.  And then I did extra, remember?  Every time you went no, I went okay.  And Mars went okay.  And Mars was even saying through it,  you've got to go down further.  And I was going down further.  All right.  And out of the push-ups you did,  the listeners will decide if you did 20 good ones.  Okay. 
[02:56:30]  That's fair.  That's fair.  I lose my 100 no matter what.  Well, you bet it.  But the guilt will get to you.  Sometimes you're the bar.  Shit.  Sorry.  I'm trying to...  Sometimes you eat the bar.  Sometimes the bar...  What was that again?  Oh, what?  Sometimes you have the bar.  Sometimes you eat the bar.  I was trying to say.  So we're good.  You're keeping my 100, right?  All right.  All right.  We're keeping my 100, right?  We're good?  Well, you're putting the video up.  Yeah.  I'll delete the video.  OP, this is not the way gentlemen bet with one another.  This is...  We made a bet.  I'll just do it again. 
[02:57:00]  But if you won the bet, then you should keep the 100 and let the video go up a line.  It doesn't even matter in the end.  According to your judge, I won the bet.  That's fair.  You're right about that.  I wanted to let Kenny judge a second time around.  I don't understand why you don't want to do it like that.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, jeez.  Uh-oh.  Here come the tweets.  Oh, boy.  Here come the tweets.  Here they come.  I want people to be fair.  And I also want people to know it's a really boring video.  But when you look at it, I think you're going to see some bad push-ups.  I'll tell you what. 
[02:57:30]  This is how fair I am.  This is how fair I am.  20, 40, 60, 80, 100.  Do what you want with the video.  I don't even have to see you delete it.  I'm not playing your games.  Oh, man.  Give me my 100 back.  100's back on the table.  Now I fucking get my 100 back and I fucking humiliate you.  Give me my money.  Oh, really?  Give me my money.  Give me my money.  So that's how you play.  Yeah, I'm not playing your games.  I saw what you did there.  So I'll take my 100 back.  I don't need to see you delete the video.  I'm being a gentleman here.  Oh, you want me to delete it? 
[02:58:00]  I don't need to see you do anything with it.  Are you getting paranoid?  Now you want me to delete the video.  Did I say that?  What's going on here?  You're giving me my 100 for what?  What I'm saying is you're mad about losing this money and I don't want that to be a thing.  Yeah, Bill.  Is Joe beating Opie at his own game right now?  I think that's what's being attempted here.  I'm going to take my 100 and I'm still putting the video off.  Joe is giving Opie back his money.  If that's the way you want to do it, I mean, I don't know why you would want to be like that.  That's the way I will show you.  Joe is looking like the bigger man here.  That's what it is.  Oh, wow.  That's the 100.  You can pass it over there.  There's the hundy. 
[02:58:30]  What a dummy.  I got my 100 back.  All right.  Oh, man.  How stupid you look now?  Oh, well.  Why would you give me my 100 back?  Why would you take it?  Exactly.  Because I'm not a nice guy.  Why would you take it?  I am a nice guy.  I'd rather be on record as the nice guy that did the right thing.  Joe DeRusso looks like the big man here now.  And I'm a guy that didn't lose $100.  All right.  Wow.  And you're still going to probably post the video.  Now you gave Dr. Steve's money back.  You gave my money back.  You're giving Bill Burr his money back?  Yeah, everybody can have their money back.  Oh, wow.  So you just lost a three. 
[02:59:00]  You had 300 in your pocket.  I did what I was asked to do, and I honored my bet.  And I think it's only fair to put the video up to see if you did the right thing.  I'm going to take a quick impromptu poll here with the people here on PalTalk.  Who looks like the better person during this whole debacle you've been listening to?  Those are your people.  They're going to, of course, trash me.  No, no, no.  I just don't know.  Those are your people.  Let me see.  Joe, Joe.  Of course they're all going to say Joe.  Opie's the bully.  Opie.  Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe. 
[02:59:30]  Joe, Opie looks like the cheapo.  Opie the Jew.  Joe DeRosa was very honorable.  Of course they're going to say that.  Joe's a bitch.  Joe's a bitch.  There's one.  You honed those people.  DeRosa.  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley.  Opie is stingy.  Joe's kind of a bitch.  You know what?  Now you put me in a bad place.  I got to put the video online.  Is that real?  So these people understand what I've been going through for the last half hour with this bet,  Joe.  Okay.  So I got my hunter back. 
[03:00:00]  Now we put the video online.  Well, again, if that's the way you want to do it.  And this is what I'll do for you, Joe.  I got one for you, Joe.  Joe, I'll give you $75 just to see a video of you doing jumping jacks.  This is what I'll do, Joe.  What's that?  This is fair.  I put the video online.  I'll give it, I don't know, a couple days.  And then I'm going to poll the people, and we'll decide if you won the bet fair and square.  Opie, you do what you want to do with the video. 
[03:00:30]  You're not going to fucking put guilt in my head.  I sound like I'm panicking a little bit here, but I'm fine with this.  The guilt is in your own head.  I'm fine with this, Joe.  Your own guilt is speaking right now.  I'm fine with this.  Look, see, I'm putting it right back in my wallet.  I'm good.  Are you?  Yeah, I'm good right now.  You sound like the guy in the bar gets shot down by the hot chick.  She wasn't hot anyway.  That's a fucker.  I'm good.  Could you talk yourself into this a little more?  See, now what are the listeners?  Now the video has to go online.  Okay.  Because they don't even know what we're talking about.  But what are the viewers of the video going to be looking for to see, like, if he didn't 
[03:01:00]  or did win the bet?  Because now that the money is given back, though, it's all null and void.  You could just leave it at that.  I'm just showing brilliance right now.  Fuck, she got my money back.  I don't give a fuck what these people think of me because they don't know the real fuck of me, Joe.  That's what I say today.  You know what I realized today?  I don't know the real you either.  Well, good.  I don't want you to know the real me.  I don't want you to know the real me.  Damn.  Have you been invited to my house?  No.  Only the real people have. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, that's not nice.  You want to play this game?  If I really like you, I invite you to my house.  Oh, all right.  Did you get that invite?  I mean, you want to add fuel to the fire here.  I've had you in my home.  We've broken bread at my table together.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  I felt bad about that, knowing that I would never invite you to my house.  Oh, no.  Jeez.  Wow.  And answering Ant's question, I'll go with the Mars rule, even though I don't like the Mars rule.  The video goes up, and Mars said you had to go, what, break 90 at? 
[03:02:00]  No, 90 degrees at the elbow.  Do you have to break the 90 or just do 90?  Just the 90.  90 degrees at the elbow.  So I'll go with the Mars rule.  Which I did.  No, you didn't.  Well, whether he did or not, it was null and void.  It was null and void when he won, because no matter what the rules were, he said it was okay.  I knew the whole time you were going to still put the video up.  Do you understand?  I'm good.  And then why wouldn't you keep the 100?  Because I'm not that kind of guy.  Shut up already. 
[03:02:30]  Do you understand?  The difference?  I knew where you were going with this.  Joe, shut the fuck up.  Listen to me.  Bill, I assume you've been eating a lot of blueberries the last hour.  Yes.  I will give you $100 if you let them film you doing 50 jumping jacks.  No.  No.  I mean, thank you, but no.  I appreciate it.  How are you with sit-ups?  Can you do sit-ups?  I'm not doing anything else.  No, I'm 30, Joe.  Joe, I'll give you $100 if you're doing 30. 
[03:03:00]  I just want to see the video of you doing jumping jacks.  I'll tell you what, Bill.  When you come to town, when you come to town, I'll just do them for you in private, and then  you take me to lunch.  How about that?  No, that's creepy.  That's creepy.  I know.  I want to see.  I want you to.  Come on, Joe.  I want to watch the uncoordination.  No.  I'm not doing it anymore.  That's all I want to say.  You're an old friend, Joe.  Joe, you want $20 for a cab fare?  No.  No.  No.  It's a winner?  No.  No.  This was just a nice gesture.  Fine.  $150.  No.  Bill, no.  I'm not doing jumping jacks on video for money. 
[03:03:30]  I'm not that broke.  Jesus Christ.  Well, you did the push-ups.  Well, because it was a bet.  There was game involved in that.  There was sport.  Do I give you the $100 back if the listeners decide it was a real fucking one fair and square?  You don't have to give me the $100 back.  Good.  I was doing something on honor with you by giving it back here.  You're not going to trick me with that guilt shit.  It's not guilt.  Bill, Bill.  Yes.  I'm sorry, Bill.  Yes, sir.  Joe, I got $200 that says you can't do 50 jumping jacks.  He really wants to see those jumping jacks.  Bill, I'm not doing jumping jacks. 
[03:04:00]  I love how this makes Bill so happy.  I'll tape it later and send it to you for free.  All right?  Jesus.  Fucking Billy just laughing at him.  Bill loves the visual of you doing jumping jacks.  That's the funniest thing ever.  Joe, $200.  Come on, Joe.  No.  What do you say, Joe?  No.  No.  Wow.  You could walk out of there, Joe.  You could walk out of there today.  You made $500.  I didn't make anything.  I gave Steve his money back.  Opie took his money back. 
[03:04:30]  I'm telling you we're even.  Hey, Dr. Steve.  I didn't make a dime.  We all know when we go to break, you're going to get your money, and so do you.  So stop setting yourself up to be the Christ.  Oh, I'm not giving this money back.  No, I don't think he's.  I don't think so this time.  No, I'm not giving this money back.  Bill, I don't think he's giving it to me.  I don't think he was stupid enough to give it back to me and then make believe it's going  to, like, guilt me.  Stupid.  Yeah.  Then I'm not giving it back to him.  And, Dr. Steve, by the way, you owe me $50 now because I saved you fucking $100.  No, I'm paying $50, Joe. 
[03:05:00]  Dude, I don't know what else on my bets.  I'm paying.  Thank you, Steve.  What, are you in cahoots with him?  Yeah, keep with your guilt.  I don't give a fuck.  I saved $100 today.  Someone's saying the word guilt a lot.  Yeah.  I saved $100 today.  Yeah.  Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt.  I'm all right.  Joe, the Rosa.  Joe.  Hey, Opie, you want to go to lunch?  No, I'm not guilty.  I mean hungry.  What?  Why'd you say guilty?  I didn't.  What are you talking about?  I'm fine.  I can sleep with myself.  I'm good.  Can you?  Yes, I'm good. 
[03:05:30]  All right.  $250, Joe.  He's still trying to get these jumping jacks out of you.  You know what?  And I'll throw the $100 that should be yours already.  Oh, my God.  That's $350 for 15 fucking jumping jacks.  No.  And they got to be legit.  Your fingertips have to touch at the top.  Is that how that works?  I don't even know how.  This is a new bit.  Jumping jacks for money.  Jumping jack Joe.  Yeah, well.  Come on, Joe. 
[03:06:00]  $350.  That's easy.  No.  Right.  She could fucking whine again that I didn't touch my fingers the right way.  Wait till they see the video.  I'm sure they're all going to see it.  Wait till they see the video.  I'm sure they're all going to see it.  I'm going to slow it down, too, so they can really study the tape.  Good.  Good.  Bring it on.  Where it goes.  Those YouTube videos.  I never had a problem with that video going online.  I never had a problem with it.  That's why I agreed to the bet.  I got to be honest, you guys.  I got to be honest.  I never realized Opie was this tight. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, I know.  What happened?  I know.  What happened?  Yeah, that's cool.  You need the $100 back Joe?  $275, Joe.  Plus my $100.  I'll throw $25 in there.  Make it even $5.  $500 for 50 jumping jacks.  No, I, I, no.  What did you find?  Guys, do you realize, do you realize the remixes and the music that your listeners would put 
[03:07:00]  underneath the show?  Yes.  This would be the best money I ever spent.  Come on, Joe.  Do it for the show.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  No.  No, no, no.  Do you want the money back?  No, no, I don't, no.  If you don't, then I'm good.  Huh?  I'm good, then.  Well, I wouldn't use the word good in the description of yourself.  I'm good.  I'd pick a different word.  Personally.  I'm good.  I would say I'm fine. 
[03:07:30]  I'm good.  I'd be, I've grown accustomed to myself.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I think.  All right, Bill.  I think we've got to finally take a break.  Yeah.  You gave us an amazing two hours today, sir.  Thank you.  Actually, I just looked at my cell phone.  It was an hour and 28 minutes.  Wow.  Fuck.  That's the longest phone ever, I think.  And I'll tell you what would have made it a memorable hour and 28 is if Joe took $300. 
[03:08:00]  300.  Jumping jacks for $300.  What's wrong with you?  Because it's not, the price is not $300 for these jumping jacks.  The price is everything that will come after.  Exactly.  That's what you're paying.  Do one without cameras on.  Joe, if you had a soul.  If you had a soul, you wouldn't be in this business.  Take the fucking money.  That's exactly why I'm on my way out.  He still has a heart.  One jumping jack without the cameras on.  Just to see what it would look like.  No. 
[03:08:30]  Yes.  What am I, a fucking...  Kenny, do a jumping jack, please.  Look how easy this is.  Who cares?  I'm too tall for this room.  Oh, my God.  He hits the ceiling, you fucking giraffe.  The way we do jumping jacks at my school is we do them overhead.  What grade are you in at school, Kenny?  And then in front.  Shit really rolls downhill in this room, doesn't it?  It certainly does.  You know what?  I'm going to give you $20 for that line. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, wow.  And I'm going to pay you for good lines.  Oh, okay.  Look, a gesture, Joe.  Is it?  You're the only person I know that thinks crumpling up money and throwing it at somebody  is a gesture.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You want my gesture or not?  You want my fucking Mookie to do the right thing?  You want my gesture?  Holy shit.  This is a little make good, a little gesture.  Throw it over.  Let's see where it falls.  You sure?  Yeah.  But Kenny finishes school story.  He's going to tell us.  Here, this is a gesture. 
[03:09:30]  We're good.  Go ahead.  We're good.  20 bucks.  Oh, you had to miss it?  Yes.  I had to pick it up.  Like a stripper.  It's real bad.  You just had to pick that up like a stripper and now you threw your back at it.  Oh, man.  I think it's fucking...  Oh, my God.  All right, Joe.  God damn it.  Yeah.  How come no matter which way the money's going, Joe looks like an asshole?  I don't know.  Could it be the fucking Kahoot set up that goes on this?  It really is.  You don't know how to play this game. 
[03:10:00]  That's why.  I know how to play it.  No, you don't.  I fucking beat you at it today.  I gave you your money back and you said guilt.  Your problem is...  It was a goddamn buzzword for the feds to come in during a drug deal.  Your problem is that you think it's still real life when these mics are on.  That's how I get away with this shit.  I go home to my real fucking life.  I don't think it's real life when these mics are on.  By the way, Bill, he hurt his back picking up the 20 I threw at him.  I should have left it on the floor, Joe. 
[03:10:30]  I don't know.  You know what?  I think in all of this, Anthony, I saw an ugly side of Opie and of Joe DeRosa that I  didn't realize.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The money made them look really bad.  You know who wants to get in on the bat?  They had an awful power struggle that they just went through.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know who wants to get in on the bat?  Who?  Steven Singer.  He's doing a read.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, what does Steven Singer got?  He's got a lot of jewelry, you know, he could bet. 
[03:11:00]  Well, why don't you tell me about it?  I'm going to put my glasses on.  Can we let Bill go?  He doesn't want to sit through this shit.  Yeah, yeah, Bill.  He's a very important guy.  Thanks.  You know what?  You disappointed me, Joe.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  Again.  Notice he didn't say I disappointed him.  Only you, Joe.  Oh, my God.  Well, you know.  I hope you can live with yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm all right.  He doesn't need me to plug dates.  Oh, shit.  So he's fucking throwing it at me.  I get it.  Let the record show in the end you felt guilty because you knew you didn't win that money 
[03:11:30]  fair and square.  Let the record show that you're fucking heartless and you're still going to put the video up.  How about that?  You know what?  That makes two of us.  I've been on the phone for an hour and a half.  I haven't hyped my frigging stand-up date.  Yeah, come on.  In about 20 minutes.  Well, I would suggest you go to billburr.com because you've got a lot of dates, but what are  some of the ones coming up soon?  I'm going to be in Atlanta on February 9th, Charlotte, North Carolina on the 7th, Alabama  on February 8th. 
[03:12:00]  And then the week after that, I'm going to be doing, I'm going to be barnstorming New  Jersey and Long Island.  And Foxwoods in between.  I got to say.  I got a second show at Foxwoods, too.  Oh.  I got to say, I'm breaking character now.  I saw Bill and Joe at Carnegie Hall.  Holy fuck.  Go see Bill Burr.  His new hour is amazing.  Hilarious.  No, I'm hilarious.  I saw Bill and Joe DeRosa.  Holy fuck.  Go see Bill.  Oh.  Oh.  See that? 
[03:12:30]  Did you?  No, you think I didn't notice that?  Oh, wow.  I didn't even notice.  But then I realized that, you know, Bill was the headliner at Carnegie Hall and I don't  want to fucking give him equal billing.  Joe was really good, too.  I appreciate you doing that, Opie, because Joe DeRosa's ego was so out of control.  Yeah.  During that setup, I know he felt like we were co-headlining.  His ego.  Right.  Right.  I guess I.  It's my ego.  You're the one throwing $300 at somebody to do physical fucking tricks for you.  Like some kind of fucking sick sultan. 
[03:13:00]  Bringing the dancing girls.  Joe, that wasn't ego.  That was my love of comedy.  Oh, yes.  That's what it was.  No, Joe.  At your expense.  Joe absolutely killed at Carnegie.  But they were there to see Bill.  And Bill killed with his out.  Of course it was Bill.  It was Bill's show.  I know.  I didn't know how to say that.  Now I feel like an idiot for real.  Joe was really good.  And of course, Bill was really good.  Boo, Opie Radio comes across like a dick today.  Oh, you found one, Joe, did you? 
[03:13:30]  Hold on.  No, no, no.  You want me to turn on my fucking Twitter, Joe?  Yeah, you might as well bring up 24-karat gold-dipped roses.  All right, yeah.  BillBurr.com.  Bill, thank you so much.  And Bill Burr on Twitter.  Bill, thank you.  That's right.  All right, guys.  Thanks, Bill.  Bill.  In the last hour and a half of my life.  All right, great.  All right.  And Dr. Steve, thank you.  Yes, Dr. Steve.  What a good man.  Thanks, boys.  I listened to his show, too.  Oh.  In the hour and a half I was on, I had my kids.  When your patients died? 
[03:14:00]  Dropped them off at school.  Oh.  Took the dry cleaning.  Took an amazing shit and then lost 100 bucks.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  All that went on?  What a morning.  To us, it felt like 10 minutes.  He just lived his morning.  All right.  Thanks, boys.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  All right.  I'll see you, Steve.  You know where I live.  Just send me the 50 in the mail.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  I saved him 50.  That's fair.  Oh, boy.  In the end, he only loses 50 instead of 100.  I would take that bet.  Yeah.  Well, Kenny, I'm sure you wanted to. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Kenny, feel free.  All right.  I think Steven Singer would like another take on this whole thing.  Listen up.
