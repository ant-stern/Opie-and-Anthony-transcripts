<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion about DVD piracy and a humorous reenactment of scenes from *Jaws*, including detailed commentary on the film's special features and the underwhelming Universal Studios Jaws ride.  A former Universal Studios tour guide, Rick, called in to share numerous anecdotes about his experiences, describing the various sets and attractions, including malfunctions of the Jaws animatronic and other tour gimmicks.  Listener calls followed, detailing their own Universal Studios experiences and transitioning into a discussion of disgusting Long Island Railroad bathrooms, punctuated by stories of road rage and fan encounters.  The segment concluded with promotion of "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" and information on obtaining wow stickers.

The next segment opened with listener calls, one about a siren causing a driver to pull over, and another detailing a chaotic softball game in Central Park involving a heavily intoxicated woman named Lady Di and accusations of theft, with a caller, "Bleacher Anthony," claiming responsibility for stealing $20. The hosts then discussed a job posting for an afternoon drive DJ at their former station, WAF, speculating on the impending firing of "Rock Hole," who subsequently called in defensively.  This led to vulgar exchanges and threats of further harassment of the station if Rock Hole wasn't fired within a week. The discussion veered into Chicago ratings, further listener accounts of Rock Hole, details about the surprise firing of their previous boss, Dave Douglas, updates on Lady Di's continued intoxication, a listener fired without realizing it, a call from an apparently inebriated Lady Di,  a "F.U." message segment, a humorous review of a David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar concert, audio of Allen Iverson's mother, and Tiger Woods's stance on women at Augusta National Golf Club.  Rick contributed a song about an AIDS-themed Muppet on a South African Sesame Street. The segment was interspersed with numerous commercial breaks.

The following segment began with commercials for Stacker 2, Land Rover Freelander, Coors Light, and Hotwire.  The hosts discussed Jim Norton's anger at the radio station's sales staff for misrepresenting his comedy sets, resulting in his cancellation of appearances.  A phone call, seemingly from someone impersonating Princess Diana, offered an apology for cursing.  The conversation shifted to Tiger Woods's response to Augusta National's women's policy, with the hosts expressing disagreement with a New York Post article criticizing Woods and engaging in misogynistic comments and jokes.  They discussed the changing workplace dynamics regarding sexual harassment, expressing resentment towards what they perceived as overly sensitive and litigious environments.  More commercials and a brief return to the Tiger Woods discussion concluded this segment.

A subsequent segment began with discussion about lowering fire department standards to include more women, transitioning into disparaging remarks about bridal showers.  A female caller, Alice, challenged the hosts' views, leading to further discussion about women's ability to handle "guy" environments.  A significant portion focused on a callerâ€™s anecdotes about activities with her boyfriend, Rick (who was in the studio), including pumpkin picking, detailing Rick's reluctance to participate.  Further listener calls discussed sexual harassment, the hosts' own experiences, and anecdotes about baby showers and bachelor parties.  The segment included commercials for a "Real Men of Genius" segment about toilet paper refillers, WWE Vengeance, and various automotive and beverage commercials, along with a humorous audio clip of a fictional Jim Norton radio show.

The final segment included numerous commercials for various products and services, including Smirnoff Ice, a stock market seminar, and cars.  A caller, Lazarus, provided slang definitions and a shout-out to Old Dirty Bastard. A rambling, unintelligible call followed, leading to a discussion about difficult callers. The bulk of the segment focused on Allen Iverson and his mother, playing audio of a contentious interview and making jokes about Iverson's spending habits.  A discussion about gender roles and relationships ensued with a heated exchange between the hosts and a caller, Luann.  The show concluded with a review of a Rolling Stone article about a Sammy Hagar and David Lee Roth concert and a discussion about a Robin Williams stand-up special.  A final segment started with discussion of a comedian's act, followed by a "What Do We Learn" segment featuring listener calls, often using offensive language and making crude remarks.  A caller criticized the show's lack of focus,  followed by updates on a "Wow" contest and more listener calls, including a heated exchange with a caller named Frenchy.  The show concluded with acknowledgement of the "Wow" contest and thanks to callers.

[00:03:00]  machine yeah it was a huge machine on this huge metal pulley contraption yeah and it would sink  every time they put it in the water it didn't work for like the first three months of production  you know and i was watching jaws last night and i was looking really close to the shark  god for for when when did that come out 75 right i think they did a damn good job it doesn't it still  holds up to the test of time that damn shark huh the little the little video game doesn't though

[00:04:30]  exhibit at universal and how lame is the the universal studios tour jaws thing the whole tour  no the whole tour blows yeah you get on these trams if you've never done this i think everyone's done  it at some point in their life if you've ever been to california or what's even worse than the  california one at least the california one i think they actually used some of the sets i don't even  believe that the the like the car like the car from back to the future yeah yeah yeah that's that's  no that that obviously isn't the one that was oh yeah that's the blues brothers car yeah yeah i believe 
[00:05:00]  on the universal lot they did have leave it to beaver's house right in california now i think  steve do you know anything about that what the uh universes i took that tour actually last october  in california or or florida california okay and i i think a lot of those sets are legit are were used  or sure they got like the facade from you know psycho yeah yeah they got the little motels down  below and stuff it's not like these whole full-blown houses no it's just the front oh and boy the tram 
[00:05:30]  driver doesn't uh let you forget that these of course are called facades as we drive around the  back of the house you'll notice that oh look no walls i guess june cleaver couldn't get dressed in  here which means false front facade and now the jaws exhibit look at here we are in the lovely uh 
[00:06:00]  town of amity there it is and look there's uh the fisherman out there you catch anything oh my god  what's happened to him his boat turned over and he didn't even move his legs didn't flannel or nothing  he just turned right over to still holding his fishing pole and he got sucked into the water oh  my god oh and we're heading right for him in our tram gee we're really scared because you can see  jaw's head you see the shark's head right under the surface of the water not moving until that big 
[00:06:30]  machine behind him pushes him right towards our tram those of you to the left might want to get your  cameras ready for this very spontaneous opportunity it wasn't even working the day we went no the  tram just kind of drove by the limp jaws just sitting there out of the water it's like oh great now we're  turning down new york street which is an exact replica of new york city yeah yeah sure not even 
[00:07:00]  close exact replica we're the nigerians yeah yeah yeah the funny thing is rick was one of the tour  guys at universal studios he used to do that do you remember any fun lines uh yeah okay here i gotta  hear the real some of the real life how many times a day did you have to do this five times a day  five times a day basically once an hour twenty five times a week all the rooms loaded on the tram  let's hear okay let me get let me get in the mood yeah all right i'm sitting in the tram i'm sitting 
[00:07:30]  universal studios i've been in a hot line for like two hours waiting with screaming kids and i'm finally  on the tram and here's rick to entertain us and what kind of fun cast your mind we're in california  okay we're in california oh my god come on come on rick you remember you remember yeah take that  off so it's more like it was all right welcome aboard the universal studios hollywood super tramp 
[00:08:00]  presented by texaco you dick the super tramp presented by texaco is it  universal studios tour guide i'm your tour guide rick did you say that come on give it to us  i love it  uh no i wasn't a tour guide it was a studio guide ah okay i'm going to be your studio guide and bob 
[00:08:30]  here's your driver give us the horn bob i'm so excited to be here this is great i got my camera  ready so i want to hear everything our studio guide rick has to say so don't be talking i got  my my disposable camera ready and i'm on i want to see the psycho house i'm i'm on my honeymoon  five points texas what what what do we come up through five points texas you'll notice that the  doors on one side of the street appear to be larger than the doors on the other side of the street why 
[00:09:00]  is that why that's because back in the 20s and 30s when they were making a lot of westerns  some of the actors weren't as tall as they should have been to portray these actors  this is the speed and you sit there like oh this is ponderous every ponderous and of course  if you ever see one fly through one of those windows don't worry because they can pick it up  and eat it because those windows are made with sugar  do we have the bus sound over there somewhere where's the bus sound rick i gotta get the whole 
[00:09:30]  thing i'm almost feeling it like i was there this is great amazing that he remembers that i'm starting  a flashback yeah i'm remembering the whole thing  okay pookie dude it was horrible horrible all right let's let's let's pull away now from the uh western street  here we go ah in our little tram and as we pull away from five points texas 
[00:10:00]  don't laugh we'll be coming up on a small town you might know as amity  now the music would start right yeah then we have we would have we would have a little thing with a  soundtrack so you can play different music for different sections right yeah right so you go  through amity and we see bob hey bob how's the fishing today uh-oh there goes bob that's it 
[00:10:30]  oh the chinks i'm gonna eat this up they'll snap and pick it up oh god well as we make our way  around we'll let somebody know that bob's having a problem oh what was that because then the shark  comes up and starts like chomping at the side of the thing with water spewing out yeah i remember that  but then it's real believable when jaws backs up yeah yeah you look behind you you see jaws backing 
[00:11:00]  up into his original position now what about maybe the uh the battle star galactica portion  did they have that the little tunnel yeah what else do you remember oh the tunnel oh the tunnel yeah  actually we we more or less talked about it as it was yeah you might remember this tunnel from  the six million dollar man when he ran after bigfoot and you know that wasn't the tunnel they used  it's been on that damn tram ride and then the um king kong the king kong part right they had uh 
[00:11:30]  the earthquake too with the uh wasn't that with king kong the whole king kong was on there too  you come into the studio they open up the doors and then uh it closes behind you now we're in new york  tell us about the the flood that comes down the uh uh yeah the hillside and then the water opens up  from uh the 10 commandos that that well the flood is earthquake right right all right so we pull into  uh stage 54 i think yes which was a uh two-story stage one of the only one of its time there we go 
[00:12:00]  are you stoned mr uh guide man you're laughing an awful lot my my young uh son here is saying  you're stoned well don't worry heroki this thing will get very very interesting in a minute okay  as you see they've been doing some filming here that's why you see some of the sets that have been  set up and that was that was always a line of crap too yeah they weren't they would never film on 
[00:12:30]  the tram line would they um that's retarded actually no they did do uh filming for like  the work what was the beverly hills count three yeah the real bad one yeah oh you see like the  battle star galactica yeah because it was supposed to be on the tour so of course it was going to be  filmed up but none of the none of them actually i remember the first time i was on it they go  and look running in the background that's rock hudson for his show mcmillan and wife  like what that is he crap there's peter falk yeah filming colombo here at universal 
[00:13:00]  so now we're in the uh with the earthquake stage yes and that's when uh the doors close you know this  is where we're doing some filming today oh what was that oh that that was just a little rumble those  are those are tremors we get those all the time in california a clever ruse yeah yeah because then all  of a sudden it becomes like this big shaking thing the truck from the top comes down yes and  burst into flames right and then the water comes and it floods it all out and it's like driver get 
[00:13:30]  us the heck out of here the heck because you can't curse wouldn't you just be like oh my god oh my god  holy ed they were telling you you can't do that because some of the people will actually freak out  oh you should have done that ladies and gentlemen this isn't fake please get out of the tram and run  towards the flaming truck that just fell and all the working machinery run for your life  hiroshi  let's go to jimmy jimmy what's going on how you doing guys we're doing well i i've actually done 
[00:14:00]  that tram ride myself and it was pretty damn lame i have to say but there was one piece of that  whole thing that made me turn white as a ghost why do you guys remember the bridge the collapsing  bridge let our tour guide run us through the collapsing bridge if you would please now as we  come around to this bridge you'll notice it's one of the oldest bridges here on the on the universal  studios back lot built in the 1920s and it looks a little creaky but we're going to try and sneak 
[00:14:30]  across it right now i remember that okay as we come across and then you then the trick is to keep  talking like nothing's going on and then all of a sudden the bridge drops oh yeah yeah because a  couple of pieces of lumber kind of fall right as you're rolling up to it and you get right on it  and the bridge kind of drops a couple of feet it feels like it's probably like six inches and then  as you come off and go that's just part of our falling bridge you may have seen this on the six 
[00:15:00]  million dollar man for the bionic woman remember when she jumped backwards but her hair was going  up while she was going down how do they train you for this man that's what i want to know dude it was  an intense four week course really four weeks with a book about six inches thick that you had to  memorize verbatim all for 550 an hour it sucked well it's all struggling actors anyway right right  they're gonna make their mark so they could care less who they got because everybody's just like oh my 
[00:15:30]  god i'm gonna be working in a hollywood studio oh a hollywood studio you're on the tram tour i'm  getting churros for a buck 50 less than the other guys we pass our bungalows how about the bungalows  that's bungalow 54 he knows it all this is where lucille ball uh would stay while she was getting  banged by fred runners you should just lost your mind and just read the whole that would be great  you know hilarious run for your life people let's see what else was there oh this is a favorite 
[00:16:00]  uh-oh the jinx love this one too oh my god if they could understand you oh as we come up this is  what is known as uh what was it called it was where they did all the horror movies but i forget  the exact name of it yes and you'd be like right through those walls that's where you know the  hunchback of notre dame came walking through and that's where we first saw dracula and if you look up  there right now there's one right now wave to him everybody it's the invisible band oh that old 
[00:16:30]  gang wave wave and they do have everyone to be waving yeah all the roofs that's the invisible band  and of course you got everybody with the cameras going where is he where is he click click click  did you just want to shoot some of those people did you want to shoot yourself just want to shoot myself  and then of course we get to anthony's favorite part of universal that's where moses parted the red  sea yeah oh it looked just like it did in the movie it's like a fountain you drive through it's a 
[00:17:00]  freaking fountain it's uh it's a pretty pathetic many gallons of water had to be used and pumped out  of this did you have to do the tour during gay day uh rick uh i don't think they had a gay day  when i was a universal no gay day that's disney look rick feels at home uh talking into his little  yeah yeah you could but the funniest part is can you totally picture rick doing this without a doubt  yeah with a big smile on his face wearing a universal studios uniform with a name tag it's the  only time in my life i read i would wear a name and wasn't there a break that you took like where 
[00:17:30]  you got out of the tram and went into the props uh little sound stage and walked through it and then  got back on the tram they stopped that like two years before i got by people pilfering the uh props  i remember they would just parade a bunch of people through these things and like and this you might  recognize this uh lion or this jaguar figure was used in back to the future next to the big clock  on the clock actually charge extra for that now when i was there they have like for 150 dollars a  person they take you to the individual sets where they're filming the personal tour oh great great 
[00:18:00]  anthony yeah yo hey what's going on guys hey man hey man i thought those rides were pretty damn  good except for uh king kong you thought the jaws ride was good yeah with the gasoline exploding all  right what are you insane it doesn't take a lot to entertain you huh anthony no all right man thank  you hey syndication when stars get his own radio show that might happen he's good yeah all right 
[00:18:30]  thank you buddy later jim uh emailing in hey rick  where's my lame clip today uh forget it all right oh this guy dave uh knows the revolving tunnel lee  majors fell into line eight line eight let's go to eight dave you have information on the rotating  tunnel you remember the tunnel that spun around with the lights inside yeah the blade told me the 
[00:19:00]  girl was given the tour said the lee majors got so disoriented that he couldn't shoot the whole  scene he kept falling down and that's a true story that is hysterical when you drive in that thing  it's pretty confusing it totally flips you over it makes you feel like you're uh it f's you you're  rolling that was the only part of the whole tour that was actually exciting yeah that was because  it did kind of do something to your senses kind of flipping upside down but the rest of it i love  when they just drive you past their junk and and it's like and this yeah some of these props you see 
[00:19:30]  a plane here that was used in an episode of the six million dollar man or the giant shoe six million  dollar man the giant shoe you might recognize from the incredible shrinking woman uh that was uh filmed  here on universal studios and right there there's the red ferrari magnum used to drive  and it's just like this piece of crap laying on the side of the road it looks like cardboard  dust all over it they don't even take care of the props it is not yeah i think you're lying 
[00:20:00]  did anyone call you a liar um no never get anybody uh rambunctious no pretty boring  pretty boring yeah most of them couldn't speak the language which is funny because most of the  people that couldn't speak the language were the ones that decide to sit right in the first car with  you so you're trying to throw out your best stuff your best stuff i'm riffing i'm riffing on the  cleaver house i'm doing the top shelf stuff here right i ain't getting anything from you know the  little asian family or the spanish people because they don't understand english you might recognize

Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  Whip Em Out!  We'll be right back. 
[01:00:30]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  Your doctor, your doctor.  Good afternoon, man.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  It certainly is.  I saw plenty of wows on plenty of vehicles on the way in. 
[01:01:00]  Already getting reports from Buffalo, Columbus, Cleveland, Philadelphia.  There's one from Boston.  Sightings all over the place today, Anthony.  You know something?  Listen, people put the wow sticker on their vehicle or any wow.  And not only do you have the chance of seeing boobs, but I've noticed I am more courteous to you on the road.  I won't cut off a person that has a wow on the vehicle.  Because you just know they're a miserable person like ourselves. 
[01:01:30]  Just looking to see little boobs and have some fun.  You're so right.  I've been cut off by people that have the wow stickers or something.  And I'm just not as mad because I'm thinking to myself, you know what?  But they're a listener to the show.  Just today, I was coming out of the battery tunnel.  And there's a big, I guess it was a big Chevy pickup truck.  And it had a wow on it.  And he's coming out of the tunnel.  And I'm looking to get all the way over to the right so I could take the West Side Highway up. 
[01:02:00]  And he was in my way.  And he wouldn't move.  I couldn't get quite over.  And I was getting real pissed.  He finally sped up.  And I saw the wow.  You're free to go.  Free to go.  Give you a free pass.  Take it easy.  Take it easy now.  And good luck with the wow.  There you have it.  But, man, it's a perfect day for wow in New York City, I've got to say.  Right.  Hopefully you've got your wow in your car by now.  We don't know what else to tell you.  We're halfway through the wow season.  And you should just have a wow in your car.  You should have the wow on your vehicle. 
[01:02:30]  I don't care where you're going.  What are you doing?  You going to work?  It's a beautiful day.  Where are you going?  The beach?  What are you doing?  You want to have the wow on your vehicle?  Of course you do.  It works great when you're going to concerts.  Concerts, yeah.  You know when you get stuck in the traffic as you're trying to get to the venue?  You got a wow sticker or a wow sign on the back of your ride?  Yeah.  You're going to be very surprised at the results.  So make sure you get a wow in your car, whether it's a homemade sign.  I don't see as many homemade signs.  I think we made a mistake by putting out the wow stickers. 
[01:03:00]  Really?  Yeah, because in the old days back in Boston, you know, when the station wasn't supporting us  and we couldn't make the wow stickers, you know, the listeners took it upon themselves  to make the homemade wow signs.  Yeah.  And I miss seeing the creativity of the homemade wow signs.  Yeah, but the quantity is there.  Oh, without a doubt.  Which I like.  But remember some of the guys that would make like wow signs that lit up?  Electrical tape.  Everything, yeah.  I'm talking lights.  Oh, I remember the guy that lit up his vehicle with the big wow. 
[01:03:30]  And then the duct tape and electrical tape on the back.  I like the ones that tried to peel it off and realized the sticky stuff don't come off  your car.  And they're driving around with the wow on the back forever.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  But there you have it.  You can make a homemade wow sign or you could get a wow sticker.  Here in New York City, we tell everyone to send a self-addressed stamped envelope.  Yeah.  888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  And that address is up on opieandanthony.com. 
[01:04:00]  You send the envelope and we send out the stickers.  Okay.  All right.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  Wow.  Let's go to the phones and see what's going on so far today.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Mark.  What's up, man?  What's going on?  Yo, Mark.  You totally caught me with that siren. 
[01:04:30]  What siren?  In the beginning of the show.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I'm telling you, you guys played a siren, dude.  I kept pulling over on the side of the road.  I'm looking for an ambulance, fire engine, cops.  I didn't know what was going on, man.  I really don't know what you're talking about.  Really?  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You guys are the best, man.  All right, Mark.  You're hearing things, though.  You like the show, but you're hearing things.  Okay.  Rob in Central Park. 
[01:05:00]  What's up, Rob?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  We just lost.  What's the morning?  What's it going on?  We just lost to Pharrell.  I got this chick here.  Lady Di, is she an alcoholic?  Lady Di, Lady Di, Lady Di, Lady Di.  What's her name?  What's her friend's name?  Lady Di.  Lady Di and something else.  Anthony, I'm on the phone with them.  Anthony's calling you over at the Ballsuit Cafe.  We just put her out.  Rob, we don't know any Lady Di.  No.  We don't know you.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You pig.  Is she an alcoholic?  We don't know any Lady Di. 
[01:05:30]  If you walk around as Lady Di with that kind of name, I guess you would be.  There's a big gold chain on that says wow on it.  Who is this, Voss?  What?  Who is this, Voss with that lisp?  What?  Hi, Rob.  Thank you.  Boy, they're drinking over there, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, our morning guy, Scott Pharrell, he decided to put a little softball game together in Central  Park of all places.  Very nice, and I heard it was a huge success, folks.  So congrats to Scott Pharrell.  They sound pretty ripped over there. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  Pretty wasted.  Here's another guy from Central Park checking in.  Bleacher Anthony, what's up?  Yo, guys, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, listen, I just stole $20 from Lady Di's phone bag.  She doesn't even know it.  She is hammered off her ass.  What an alcoholic.  She was here at 9 o'clock getting hammered on Jack and Coke.  She was begging Pharrell for beers.  It was daytime down here.  She is passed out.  People are taking money from her pocketbook.  She is a fat mess.  Passed out.  Who is Lady Di?  She's some bitch that died. 
[01:06:30]  She used to be on your show and she wasn't funny, so you guys kicked her off.  Lady Di.  I vaguely remember somebody named Lady something.  Some fat bitch.  I think she has been banned from our radio show.  Well, who cares?  I stole $20 from her.  You guys are the best.  No, even though we don't know her, I would love to maybe have someone put the phone by  her face if she's passed out.  Thank you.  All right, Anthony, I've got to break into our regular scheduled programming to read something  that just came in off the instant feedback. 
[01:07:00]  It's coming in like crazy.  Kevin from New Hampshire writes on the instant feedback.  WAF FM Worcester, Boston Afternoons.  I guess this is a job listing that is posted somewhere.  Someone has to help us out and tell us where.  It says WAF Worcester, Boston Afternoons.  Rocker WAF looking for a winning rock jock to take Afternoons to the top. 
[01:07:30]  Who didn't see this coming?  It says send tape and resume to Keith Hastings.  He's the new PD at our old radio station.  In care of WAF 20 Guest Street, third floor, Boston, Massachusetts.  02135-2088. 
[01:08:00]  Keith Hastings.  Uh-oh, what am I going to do?  It looks like he posted this message somewhere.  Maybe in one of the trade magazines or one of the trade websites.  Yeah, where'd that come from?  But it looks like AF is looking for a new afternoon drive DJ.  Hey.  Oh, no, what am I going to do?  I'm going to have to put Lil Rocko to work.  Didn't we say, well, we were the ones that broke the news. 
[01:08:30]  It was that our old boss, Dave Douglas, got fired.  Dave Dickless.  And no one in the business believed us when we were announcing to everybody that Dave Douglas was fired from our old radio station.  Right.  Everyone said, what?  What?  No, of course not.  It's just those guys, you know, having fun again.  Right.  Trying to get one over on their old boss.  No.  No, he was out the door.  We found out.  He didn't even know it.  Yeah, we found out he was fired before he did.  But that's the best part of that whole thing is we knew and told everybody before Dave even knew he got back from vacation and they had to fire him because the news was broken. 
[01:09:00]  He would have had another maybe couple of weeks to sit there, maybe collect a little paycheck or whatever.  And they appointed Keith Hastings as the new PD.  Yep.  And we said on the radio last week that it's a no brainer when a new PD comes in, he wants to hire a whole new staff.  Oh, boy.  So he could take credit for all the success that the station may have in the future. 
[01:09:30]  That's how they work.  If you keep the old staff and the station become successful, well, you know what?  You can't really take credit for it because you just kind of came in and was working with the old staff.  Right.  That's how it works.  It's a known thing in radio when a new PD's hired, you know, he wants to hire a lot of new people around him.  That's how it works.  And it looks like he's already looking for an afternoon drive DJ according to this posting that Tim, who's this guy?  Tom knows where it came from. 
[01:10:00]  Yes, Tom, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Tom from Boston.  Hey, Nick read that today on his show.  Yeah.  It's on allaccess.com.  Allaccess.com?  Yeah, that's where it is.  All right.  Oh, man.  And what, they list jobs or something on that website?  Nick said it was like an insider for Rock Jocks and stuff like that to get jobs and stuff.  All right.  Now it's coming in like crazy.  It's on allaccess.com that there's a posting for Rocco's job.  The guy that took over our seat after we got fired for doing the mayor's prank. 
[01:10:30]  No.  Hey, is Norton in today?  I certainly am.  All right.  Can you say bye, sweetie, to me?  What?  What's wrong, Norton?  Nothing.  I had a man...  I want you to say bye, sweetie, when I hang up.  I know you do.  I don't dig it for you.  All right.  I'm not a performing seal.  A man wants me to say goodbye, sweetie, and I'm supposed to do it eagerly.  I'm cranky.  See you later, baby.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Bye, Tom. 
[01:11:00]  Schnookums.  Hey, we got Rock Hole checking in.  Oh.  Uh, Rock Hole.  Hey, Fags.  Hey, dude.  My job's fine.  He loves me.  Who?  What?  Who loves you?  Well, Dave did.  Yeah, but Dave's gone, Rock Hole.  Shut up.  Hey, Opie, seriously, Dave asked me if you could hook him up with a hotel-y also.  Shut up, dick.  What are you going to do after they boot your ass out, man?  I'm not getting booted.  Uh, Rock Hole? 
[01:11:30]  What?  See, no one believed us when we said Dave was gone, and now there's this proof or something  going on with the ad in All Access about them looking for somebody to replace you.  Well, maybe you guys could hook me up with Middays in New York.  Well, you know.  I can't be that bad, can I?  I've got at least 18 fans to hold a rally.  Very funny.  You're being funny, Rock Hole.  What are you doing?  It's too bad you don't be funny on your own show. 
[01:12:00]  You've got to do that on your own show.  I hired Rich Voss as a writer.  That's why.  Oh, there you go.  Good job, Rock Hole.  I know the struggle.  Well, good luck to you, Rock Hole.  And good luck to you.  Rock Hole.  Yeah, what?  You need a big cardboard box.  That's what you're going to be needing when you go into your office.  You're going to have to load up all the Rock Hole memorabilia.  Shut up.  Maybe I could get the one from Opie's old TV.  Oh, wow.  Look at you.  Boy, you've been listening for a while, Rock Hole.  What do you think?  I spin records and put headphones on all day. 
[01:12:30]  Listen to my job.  Hey, F, what do you want to hear?  And then I come on and go, hey, F, you heard it here first.  All right, I'll say, Rock Hole, I want to hear some corn.  All right.  Opie and Anthony debuted this, but I'm going to say I did.  Check it out.  This is a new one from corn.  Very good.  All right, thanks, Rock Hole.  No, thank you.  Enjoy your final days in Boston, Ray.  Yeah.  Whatever, dicks.  I'm coming back.  Yeah, okay.  Later, faggots. 
[01:13:00]  Wow, he's getting tough now.  Anthony, there's got to be something to this.  Go to allaccess.com and see if you can find what everyone's talking about,  because people are freaking out.  Christian, what's going on?  Christian!  Hey, what's going on, brothers?  What's going on, man?  Pretty good.  Yeah, we were at an AF event last year.  I hate AF, but I had nothing to do, so we went up there and had a run in with our fat man, Rock Hole.  Yeah.  And I was railing him, and he was getting pissed. 
[01:13:30]  It was hilarious.  The main question was, we got him on a silent piece where I was like,  hey, Rock Hole, are you going to want to imitate ONA anymore?  Are you going to steal any more of their material?  The guy turned like white as a ghost, like he had actually seen a ghost.  It looked like he dropped a deuce in his pants.  Now, apparently we're...  I don't know what you're talking about, man.  We're too new on the air to rip off.  He goes for stuff that's really old, and he tries ripping that off.  He's worthless.  He's worthless.  He's a clown shoe. 
[01:14:00]  All right, Christian.  Well...  Hey, guys, keep up the good work.  You're keeping me laughing out here in Virginia.  I'm dying.  All right.  Thanks, Christian.  All right, brothers.  Take care.  All right.  There it is.  I just found it.  It's on allaccess.com.  It's on allaccess.  Which is a trade website.  In the jobs section, in job openings.  And there it is.  Yep.  Rocker WAF looking for winning rock jock to take afternoons to the top.  Send your tape and resume. 
[01:14:30]  And then there it is.  The name, the address.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  That's got to hurt.  Hey.  Oh, no.  I knew this would happen.  Damn.  Dave.  It's got to be tough to do your radio show knowing that they're looking for your replacement.  Hey, Dave.  It's Rockhole.  Yeah.  There's a rumor going around that I'm getting the boot.  Dave. 
[01:15:00]  Can you help me out for old time's sake?  Sorry.  Can't do it, Rockhole.  You're on your own.  Oh, well.  Well, there you have it, Ant.  All right.  Well, we'll see, um, we'll see what develops there.  It's not looking good for our favorite fat man.  Now, where were we?  That was breaking news.  Breaking news.  Poor Rockhole.  Chicago ratings. 
[01:15:30]  Um, we did good.  Is that it?  Nice.  Yeah, we just, yeah.  I mean, we're on at night, and we had a bump up.  Nothing, nothing too amazing.  I didn't even know, uh, what to look at when the ratings came in.  I walk in.  Well, we replaced minor league hockey, and now we're doing 7 to 11.  And, uh, we had a, the station overall did great in Chicago, and, uh, we had a little  bump up.  Nothing to brag about, though.  I'm just going to wait for the next one, when we know exactly where we were. 
[01:16:00]  You know?  Time-wise?  I think we were, whatever.  Yeah.  Not to make excuses.  We bumped up, but we have a long ways to go.  Mm-hmm.  We didn't go down.  No.  In Chicago?  No.  Uh, yeah, it's coming in, uh, Nick Carter broke the news on WBCM before you guys got on  the air today, um, maybe, okay, and then a lot of suggestions for shows we could put,  uh, that could try off of Rocco's job.  I think Rocco's out and about today.  Is he?  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, let him know the, let him know the news if you see him there.  Why are we breaking news first?  I don't know.  Before they even know.  Before they, how the hell do we get the info before they even know they're going to  be getting fired?  It is a huge story in the industry that we found out Dave Douglas, our boss that turned  his back on us, was fired.  We knew before he did.  And no one believed us.  And now there's a report that they're looking for Rocco's, uh, replacement right now.  Is this in, uh, net news section of All Access? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Former AF Boston Worcester PD Dave Douglas is exploring his options.  Yes, he's exploring his options, all right.  And there's a email address.  Oh, there is?  Yeah.  We wouldn't possibly, uh, give that out.  We probably shouldn't, but, uh.  Over the air.  We, we can tell the fine folks that, uh, don't forget, this is in the net news section of  allaccess.com. 
[01:17:30]  Net news.  Section of All Access.  What day was that posted?  Uh, I don't know, last week or so.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Aw.  Exploring his options.  Keep exploring, Magellan.  Good luck.  Get back to Nebraska, you hick.  I hear he's moving.  It's the other inside info I'm getting.  Nah, he's moving to a new house.  We know everything about his life.  Yeah, I know.  It's great.  People tell us before the, before he even knows himself. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  He's moving into a new house in five days.  Uh, Dave, what's going on?  Yeah.  Do we know where it is?  That kind of sucks that he had, he probably, uh, picked out this dream house in the Massachusetts  area and he gets fired and he's moving in five days.  He'll get to enjoy the new house for a couple of weeks before he has to relocate.  Yeah, why would he?  Oh, he's probably, like, selling it?  No.  Like, going for a rental or something?  He had no clues getting fired.  Right.  So he had his old house.  Okay.  And he was upgrading and he's got a new house. 
[01:18:30]  And he's, he was scheduled to move into this thing in five days.  Oh, I thought he had the house that he, uh, he wanted.  And then he was, uh, he, he sold it, but he doesn't know where he's going yet, so he's  renting another place.  No, because all this went down last week.  Oh my God.  He just, like, bought his dream house.  He bought a new house that he was supposed to move in in five days.  How much does that suck that you walk around this house that you were looking forward to  living in for many, many years, realizing you're only going to have it for a few weeks 
[01:19:00]  before you have to relocate.  Got to relocate.  Dave.  And not knowing how you're going to pay the mortgage.  Hey, what's up, Dave?  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, listen, I got, I got laid off one day.  They told me I should come in, uh, for inventory of my equipment.  And the only, the way I found out how I got laid off is because they paid my vacation on  my paycheck.  So when they had to look at my paycheck, they sold my vacation time.  I knew, I knew it was, uh, you know, quick time.  That's the only reason why I knew.  You, you learned you were fired because they paid your vacation time. 
[01:19:30]  They paid my vacation time.  That's the only reason why I found out.  Oh, okay.  That sucks.  Yeah.  My uncle fired me once.  My uncle Tony.  When I was working at Dan's Bakery out on Long Island.  It was like a bread factory.  You know, they made rolls and everything.  And I was just a complete F up.  It was very early twenties.  Was?  Yeah, I know.  I mean, yeah.  Sorry.  I think I might not even been 20.  Maybe I was 19 or 18 or something like that.  I was working there making a few bucks on a Saturday morning.  Had to get in early.  Sweep the place up. 
[01:20:00]  Get it all ready for the delivery trucks to come in and whatnot.  And my uncle Tony ran the place.  And he figured, you know, he'd help me out and give me a job there.  I was the worst.  I did nothing.  I swept badly.  And then one day I was so, like, hungover from the night before partying.  And it was so early that I fell asleep.  So he walks back.  He sees me asleep.  And this was just, like, the last straw.  And he goes, why don't you just go home?  And I was like, ooh, cool, the day off. 
[01:20:30]  I didn't even know I was being fired.  I go, ooh.  He sees I'm tired and hungover.  And he's being nice.  And he's sending me home.  Yeah.  Half day.  Half day good.  Half day for me.  Half day.  So I went home.  And then I guess he had told my mother, you know.  And my mother came back and goes, you got fired today?  I was like, no.  I didn't get fired.  She goes, well, that's not what Tony just told me. 
[01:21:00]  I said, oh, no.  You mean he didn't send me home just to be nice to me?  She goes, no, you jackass.  He fired you.  And then, you know, a whole string of how I'm a waste of life and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But I didn't even know.  I got fired and I had no clue.  No clue.  No clue.  You just thought you were getting a day off.  Half day.  Uncle Tony, do I get full paycheck for half day?  Half day, still get full paycheck.  Even though I just work half day, I get snow cone, whole snow cone, and paycheck. 
[01:21:30]  Thank you.  Diane, what's going on?  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  It's me.  How's everything?  I just wanted to let you know something.  I heard about what the guy said before, and that is not true.  Okay?  Hello? 
[01:22:00]  Anybody there?  He's dead to us.  Dead, I say.  When you want to drink at my bar, I want to know a day in advance so I won't be there.  So I won't be there. 
[01:22:30]  Great call.  Fast Freddy from Long Island here?  Yeah.  He's been calling AAF in Boston, and they aren't answering.  So he called the general number, got the receptionist, and they don't know much, but he asked who the new afternoon drive DJ was going to be.  And she said, what are you talking about?  So he says he explained to her and gave her the allaccess.com URL.  Well, she giggled, said, oh, my God, and hung up. 
[01:23:00]  Hey, it's not funny.  This war is not even fun anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's no, there's nothing fighting back.  It's just ridiculous.  Anthony, I'm going to say something now.  All right.  Because I know Intercom listens to us.  Uh-huh.  How could they not?  Yeah.  You fire Rocco within the next two weeks.  We will leave your radio station alone for four months.  We will give you a fair chance to rebuild. 
[01:23:30]  All we ask is you fire Rocco.  Fire Rocco.  You fire Rocco.  Yeah.  We will leave you guys alone, and we will allow you to regroup.  Only four months?  Yeah, four months.  And then we'll maybe six.  No, four months.  You don't want to give them six?  Four months, we'll give them plenty of time.  Four months, they'll have to rebuild.  Without us saying a word.  We'll leave their new afternoon guy alone.  That's right. 
[01:24:00]  You know Ant and I are the biggest pain in the asses as far as that radio station in Massachusetts goes.  Yeah.  All we ask, we want Rocco's head.  You fire him, we leave you alone for four months.  There's not even a peep on our radio show.  Won't even mention it.  Nope.  What if the afternoon guy thinks he's...  We'll be too busy taking down Howie Carr.  What if the new afternoon guy that they get in there thinks he's going to be a hot shot? 
[01:24:30]  Doesn't matter.  Tries to take us on.  We'll let him?  We'll let him.  We'll let him.  Give him a free pass.  Free pass.  For four months.  Four months.  That's pretty good.  You have our word on this.  You know it's the only way.  You know we'll continue kicking your ass.  We want Rocco's head.  And then Ant and I could go home at night and rest and laugh.  Peacefully.  And laugh.  Knowing we finally got our revenge on our old radio station. 
[01:25:00]  That's all we ask.  Give us Rocco's head.  We leave you alone for four months.  It was just Dave and Rocco, right?  That's just there really wasn't anybody else there that we had huge problems with.  Everyone else that made the station cool, they're long gone.  They had moved on.  This is the last piece.  And the last two real scumbags.  The last piece.  You take him out, we leave you alone.  Right.  And allow you to regroup.  All right. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, I'd be into that.  Okay.  Think about it.  Think about it.  Well, now that we broke some kind of news about them looking for a replacement for Rocco.  Who the hell knows if that's real?  It looks like it's real.  Yeah, but perhaps they're thinking about it.  And now they'll have to pull the trigger.  They have to do it soon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If they don't do it within, let me think.  Hmm.  How about we give them a week from Friday?  A week from Friday. 
[01:26:00]  If they don't do it, by then.  All bets are off.  All bets are off.  And even if you then fire Rocco, because you're going to have to anyway.  Right.  We know that's happening.  See, if you're going to fire him, the offer we make, you do it by a week from Friday, we leave you alone for four months.  Right.  You wait longer, all bets are off.  Now you get rid of the rock hole, get a new guy in there, and we're going to be pounding on him.  All bets are off.  Mm-hmm.  It's up to you.  Think about it.  I would think about it.  That's all we want.  The final piece of revenge. 
[01:26:30]  It would be so much easier for them.  Wouldn't it be?  They just unloaded that guy.  Week from Friday.  You fire Rocco, we leave you guys alone for four months.  Yeah.  That's a promise.  That is a promise.  Rock hole.  Hey.  Hey.  We're off the air, right?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  You guys are just kidding, right?  No.  What?  No.  No, come on.  First of all, can I do my real voice?  Because this is, come on.  You guys know how I talk. 
[01:27:00]  You shut up.  You did.  No, that's the rock hole.  All right, man.  But we're off the air, so nobody's going to really know.  Look, I'm not really, I'm not, hold on a second.  I'm not really losing my job, am I?  I'm really.  You'll have to wait and see, my friend.  Like, can you guys help me out?  Like, come down and box me.  Payback is a bitch.  We told you what you had to do months ago.  We told you you had to fight back, but Dave told you to not even mention us. 
[01:27:30]  Look where it got him.  And now if you start talking about us, it's too late.  Everyone knows you're already a pussy and a whip.  I'm not a pussy.  You guys know I'm not a pussy.  I would take the next two weeks to maybe, you know, send out some tapes and resumes.  What?  Say hi to the gang in Tampa, where you're from.  Maybe there's a little, cute little radio station you could go play with for a while.  I have nowhere else to go.  That's all I got.  Stop it.  I'll give you a hint.  What?  Hey, Dave, fries are up.  Shut up.  Hey, Dave, you work in the window tonight. 
[01:28:00]  Hello.  Welcome to McDonald's.  I'm Dave Douglas.  I'll take your order now.  Once again, he's my manager.  I could work for him again.  I'm exploring my options here at McDonald's.  Can't Norton come down?  I can box hit him.  Rockhole, McDonald's doesn't have pizza.  They just have burgers and your pizza.  So you might want to try to get a job at Pizza Hut.  At Pizza Hut.  Oh, I want to say, hey, Scorch ripped off my voice, too. 
[01:28:30]  You guys know it.  All right.  You know he ripped off my voice.  All right.  Get out of here.  Come on.  That's funny.  Oh, boy.  Here's audio of Rockhole as he goes down to the GM's office later this week.  Don't you do it!  Don't!  You!  I got nowhere else to go!  Oh, Rockhole.  I got nowhere else to go!  Oh, look, he's crying. 
[01:29:00]  I got nothing else.  Oh.  Oh, well.  That's a shame.  There you go.  There's the deal we put on the table for WAF.  You'll get a four-month head start.  That just makes it fun for us.  Makes it a little more interesting.  Yeah.  Because it's been way too easy since we've been brought back to Boston.  Yeah.  All right, Anthony? 
[01:29:30]  Right.  Oh, well, let's get back on track.  We got a lot to do today.  We brought in the David Lee Roth, Sammy Hagar review.  It's hilarious.  Very funny.  Maybe we can read that next, okay?  I can't found it.  Uh, Jay Moore, obviously a big fan of Anthony and his bits.  Oh!  We'll get into that in a little bit.  He should have flown you out to LA as well.  I'm thinking that was my big shot.  That could have been your big shot on the show.  I didn't get a spot.  We got Iverson's mom, some audio from her that is hilarious, and we got to talk about 
[01:30:00]  Sex for Sam and get the contestants finally.  And that woman was breaking down all kinds of stereotypes on the clip I heard.  Oh, I know.  Oh, my God.  We'll get into that in a little bit.  Also, Tiger Woods agrees that women should not be allowed to join Augusta Country Club.  No, no women on Augusta.  I applaud Tiger Woods.  Ah, yes.  Cinderella's story is he lines up his last shot. 
[01:30:30]  Normally reserved crowd here at Augusta on their feet.  Oh, he got a lot of that one.  He got a lot of that one.  What is he talking about?  He doesn't want women to be able to play.  We'll get into it.  But Augusta has been men only for forever.  And just like everything else in this stupid country of ours, the PC police are getting  their hands into everything.  No women at Augusta.  So now.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Except you, Pookie.  Now, there's a big stink. 
[01:31:00]  They want women to be allowed to join this country club.  Next thing they're going to want to be able to bring in blacks.  Well, that's why people think that.  It's funny you say that, but that's why people think Tiger Woods is a hypocrite.  Because he should understand about segregation and all that.  What a doodle there.  It's the Grease Man Show.  It's actually true, though, because women should be allowed to join because they were  so important for the Citadel once they got let in. 
[01:31:30]  Stupid holes.  Just stay home and cook and shut it.  Remember that chick with her pocketbook while all the other guys were there because they  wanted to be there?  Yeah.  She was there just to try to, you know.  Exactly.  Just to do it.  Just to do it and make everyone else's lives miserable.  Bone dry.  Why would you want to belong to a place that doesn't want you?  I wouldn't.  If there was a place that didn't want me, I wouldn't go.  All right.  Who cares?  It's a stupid golf sucks anyway.  They should drag the women behind the golf carts.  Put chains on them and drag them around the golf carts. 
[01:32:00]  Why don't we read the story and we'll get into the whole discussion next, okay?  Do you ever see a head come apart like that?  It's getting just ridiculous.  It really is.  Bone dry.  Anthony, as we go to break, could you set this up?  I hit her between the first and second hole there.  That'll get gay.  Can you set up the Sesame Street HIV puppet thing?  Oh, South Africa.  Because we got Rick's little song.  In South Africa, they have their version of Sesame Street with all the little Muppets and whatnot. 
[01:32:30]  Kids love it.  But in South Africa, they also have this huge AIDS epidemic going on.  So they thought it would be great for the kiddies to have a little Muppet, a Muppet dear, that they can relate to with.  One with the HIV, one with the virus, the ninja, high five.  So they introduced a Muppet to Sesame Street with AIDS, the AIDS Muppet.  Right.  So Rick wrote a little song called Christopher Street.  Christopher Street being the very gay street here in New York. 
[01:33:00]  That's where the homosexuals congregate and screw each other in the bongy.  Bongy.  Take the little putter.  Take the putter.  And put the butt.  Put the butt.  Put the butt.  Put the butt.  We'll be back with more of the Greaseman show after these words. 
[01:33:30]  We need some of that music, though, to make it better.  There I was at Augusta.  I saw some bitch.  Well, I took out my steel chains.  And I lashed her.  Lashed her to my golf cart.  And drove around in circles till her head was smashed apart.  The bitch deserved it.  I buried her in the sand pit up to her neck and spanked a patch on her face.  My bone was dry. 
[01:34:00]  Waddle doodle.  There's no gambling at Bushwood, sir.  And I never slice it.  There's a brown Audi parked into my spot.  I want a toad away immediately.  Goes for the old Billy Baroo.  Reminds me when I was slinging golf balls at Augusta.  That was a great line. 
[01:34:30]  For who I should have yelled to.  Hey, Whitey.  Nice hat.  Hey, colored boy.  Grab my bag.  All right.  We're going to get into the story next.  Right.  Okay.  Rick needs the karaoke version of the Muppet Show theme.  As we make our listeners do all the work for us.  I can't find it. 
[01:35:00]  Less work for us.  More gooder.  You didn't read the great producer article, Rick?  You're supposed to be able to have that stuff.  Ready.  Like that.  All right.  Here's Christopher Street from Rick.  We're all gay.  Stick and see in our ray.  T-cells low.  We got the HIV. 
[01:35:30]  It's a great way to lose some weight.  On our way to Christopher Street.  Dead in days.  Lesions all over my face.  Pound my angst and grab some A-D-D.  You can watch my life wither away.  On our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street. 
[01:36:00]  How old are you?  18.  All right.  Oh, you showed up.  Wow.  Fabulous.  Wow.  Hopi, ravioli.  Hopi.  And Anthony.  And W.  He may have actually been talking into a sausage.  We don't know at this point.  Ron and Fez.  Weeknight at 7 after Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  Hi.  This is Tiki Barber of the New York Giants.

Just about every day now, people are asking me how they can improve their vision without expensive or risky laser surgery.  Hi, I'm Harriet Hartley, and I've been recommending the SeeClearly method for over two years now, and I'm here to tell you it works. 
[01:44:30]  People discover that in just minutes a day, they can reduce or possibly even eliminate their need for glasses or contacts.  For years, the standard approach to vision care has been to buy stronger and stronger glasses as our eyes get weaker and weaker.  The more we wear glasses or contacts, the more our eyes grow dependent upon them, and the weaker they become.  The SeeClearly method is a natural, proven program designed by doctors for you and your family to improve your vision at home safely and effectively. 
[01:45:00]  In minutes a day, it can help you see clearer and sharper than you ever thought possible.  So call today for a free video that introduces the power of the SeeClearly method.  Someone who cares is waiting to take your call.  Call 1-800-315-1163.  That's easy.  1-800-315-1163.  1-800-315-1163.  XM subscriber Brad Sullivan on his XM satellite radio.

I guess we've got a problem in Portland today, Anthony.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, you're being preempted out here.  We're being preempted in Portland?  Preempted by a Beavers baseball game. 
[01:47:00]  By a what?  A Beavers, oh, minor league baseball team.  Oh, I was going to say, unless it's real Beavers playing baseball, which I would excuse, because  that's fascinating.  A minor league ball game?  Why are we having such problems with minor league sports in this radio program?  Come on, get yourself on a good FM station out here anyway.  The Portland Beavers?  You're missing some great stuff today.  Oh, that's why I'm trying to sit here on hold.  You want us to keep you on hold?  Sure. 
[01:47:30]  That'd be an expensive phone bill, though.  Hey, it's my cell phone bill.  Ah, screw it.  We'll pay for it.  Hold on.  All right.  We'll call you back.  Okay.  At least we can do for a fan in Portland.  The one?  That blows.  Triple A baseball in Portland.  Portland Beavers.  Nice name.  Lady Di, what's going on?  No, no.  Not Lady Di.  It's Chris.  Yeah?  What's going on, dude?  Your show is mint.  I love it. 
[01:48:00]  Mint.  What's going on with Lady Di now?  With Hinto Sage.  Dude, she's freaked out, man.  We played for her softball.  Right.  And we're here right now, and she's hitting on one of the directors for my company.  Yeah.  I mean, hardcore.  She's half-passed out.  She's slowing her words.  Really?  And she's, like, offering him oral pleasure, Anthony, to take your word.  Really?  Hardcore.  All right.  Well, I hope she gets lucky in a mouthful.  But I must tell you, Pharrell's team whacked us. 
[01:48:30]  They've been just...  Hey, Chris?  Yeah.  How many times have you called us so far?  Me?  Never.  Not yet.  How many from your posse?  You know what?  I can't say for sure, but I know they called you to get up there and the lady died.  I think I speak for all, everybody, all of the listeners out there that no one cares.  Dude, okay.  I'm trying to keep you updated on somebody you can't stand anymore.  She's dead to us.  I don't care if she's hammered. 
[01:49:00]  I don't care if she's trying to, you know, give one of your friends a hummer.  All right.  Interesting.  Okay.  I'll give you that.  I'd rather listen to the Portland Beavers play.  She got clubbed like a baby seal tonight.  She's here trying to give oral pleasure to every guy here.  She's trying.  She's crushed.  It's not happening.  Chris, remember when I said a little while ago...  You don't care.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  I don't care what you think.  I still love you guys.  All right.  This is Rob Field. 
[01:49:30]  I work for the same company as Chris.  Are you guys there?  Why is it going to be any different if you give it to another guy?  Bro, what's your name?  Listen, we know what's going on here and it's not, you know, so it is.  Oh, we talked to you already, right?  Yeah.  You talked to me before.  What's the problem?  Is the tongue too thick?  What is it?  Do you keep your back teeth together too close when you say your asses? 
[01:50:00]  Listen, I got a list that it's not funny to make fun of.  You know, I just, whatever.  Dude, that is probably the worst list I've ever heard.  Yeah, I heard it.  They call me something after they call me whatever.  And of course we got to make fun of it.  You called the National Syndicated Radio Show.  We're going to make believe.  Let's just put it this way.  If I have a huge goiter, I'm not going to be walking around on a nude beach.  I don't have a goiter.  It's just whatever, you know?  Well, let me tell you, you talk ridiculous.  You sound like a blithering idiot. 
[01:50:30]  Well, clearly it's not my fault.  Do you drool?  I don't drool, but I sometimes spit when I talk.  Dude, it sounds all spitty and everything.  I know.  Are you getting your friends wet?  Why don't you just stop doing it?  You know how S's are supposed to sound?  It's not my fault.  No, it is.  Just stop doing it.  You don't say an S.  It's not like the letter S is very important in the English language.  Just go like this. 
[01:51:00]  Go say Chris.  What?  All right, your phone is breaking up now.  I don't understand the speech impediment thing.  I don't either, you clown.  Just stop doing it.  That's not that easy.  What's this?  No, because you've got to concentrate on the fact that you can't say your S's out of your goddamn molars.  No.  You've got to say it out of the front of your teeth.  That's S.  S.  S.  Who are we talking to now? 
[01:51:30]  What?  Ooh.  Not nice.  Come on.  I was not passed out today.  See how old earth they are down the hall on that one.  I was not passed out today.  I was watching the game with everybody else.  Okay?  They hung up on me?  Of course they hung up on me.  He said, you know, they're still...  Oh, damn it.  Oh.  They didn't play bastards.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  What did they hang up on? 
[01:52:00]  Wow.  Lady Di showing her true obnoxious drunken colors.  Now, that's the Lady Di that shows up at those goddamn Tuesday night gigs.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No one got to hear that because she was cursing.  Right.  She goes, if they continue to effing hang up on me...  Yeah.  She's like, hi, hello?  Hello?  Are you there, guys?  Hi?  Hi?  And then she thinks we hung up and she goes, ah, they effing hung up on me again, saying  the F word.  They effing hung up.  If they effing hang up on me again... 
[01:52:30]  Don't call anymore, you fat C.  Tell Lady Di...  Tell Lady Di to call the show.  Call the show.  Call the show.  No, I wasn't talking about...  I didn't say that.  Come on, guys.  Come on, guys.  No, it's...  You hear her?  F.  F.  F.  Ugh.  Disgusting.  Nervous fat girl titter.  Yeah.  All right, why don't we hit the F.U. line and catch up here, and we'll talk about Tiger 
[01:53:00]  Woods next and other things, okay?  Roy.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  I want to leave a nice big f*** you to my friend Brian for calling me on Monday and Wednesday  nights to go hang out at the bar when he knows I have to work 12 hours the next day.  So f*** you, Brian, and I'll see you later for some shots.  Next message. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, this is a big F.U. to our irresponsible roommate for writing a rubber check for written  bills.

[02:03:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show, 1027-WNAW.  It's the sloppy version of the O.P. and Anthony Show as we try to get back on track here.  There's a lot of rage flowing around the studios today.  Oh, yeah.  I just witnessed Jim Norton yelling and screaming at a sales guy. 
[02:03:30]  That was fun.  I'm cursing for a live read because the copy for WWE Vengeance was like a small book.  Yeah, those are nasty to read.  We all know Brock Lesnar is huge, but they're like 6'4", 200.  So who cares?  You've got to describe him.  He's just a huge monster.  I can't believe they had a dump out of your commercial.  We don't have to give his stats.  You said the C word during the read.  He's got an 8-inch swan. 
[02:04:00]  And he'll be a vet.  Shut up.  Just get the facts out there.  We don't have to start describing what the wrestlers look like.  My God.  So that's why I said sea sucker or whatever it was.  Right.  Hello?  Yeah, it's me.  I'm sorry for cursing before.  I just wanted to let you know that.  Okay?  It's me, Lady Di.  And I'm just sorry for cursing before.  That's all I have to say. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Hey.  That whole thing is not true about me being passed out.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ass.  Hey.  Do you hear anything?  I guess she can't hear.  No, no, no.  I'm on the cell phone right now.  So I can barely hear you right now.  Hey, let's go over there.  Help.  If I'm trying to tell you. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, God, I'm getting so pissed off.  Masty.  There's a reason why we kicked her off the show.  I know.  Dead air is better.  Stay and stay out.  Awful.  Awful.  We kicked her off the show.  Why?  She sucks.  And she showed her true colors there when she didn't think we were listening. 
[02:05:30]  Cursing.  She's like a truck driver, that.  What happened to Jim Norton?  Is he still yelling and screaming at the sales guy?  Jeremy's office.  Oh, he's in Jeremy's office now?  Yes.  Taking care of business?  He's really pissed.  He'll give us the lowdown when he gets back in the studio.  Doesn't have anything to do with Ozzy, does it?  Good.  Well, I don't know if this is boring to everybody, but Jim Norton is one of the hardest working  comedians in the business.  In show business.  Yes.  And he does his headlining gigs, you know, and we've got some dates coming up where, 
[02:06:00]  you know, he's going to sell out 1,500 2,000 seat arenas, okay?  But he, on any given night in New York City, you can see him at some of the local comedy  clubs.  One being the comedy seller, just a great place to go and see a lot of guys from this  show and a lot of comedians, actually, that are...  Legends.  Legends.  Okay.  Let's just put it that way, okay?  Anyway, the stupid sales staff around here is starting to advertise his little 5, 10-minute  sets.  Where he just goes to work out stuff. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, it's called working out material, where he'll go to a club.  He does this, like, three times a night.  And, you know, the listeners have no clue what they're getting themselves into, because,  you know, Jim will go to some of these places and only be on stage for 10, maybe 15 minutes.  He runs in, does 10 minutes, and leaves to get to the next club.  He gets to another club.  And these comedy clubs, they have about 15 comedians on the bill, more or less.  A lot of them blow, quite frankly.  Hacks, open mic nighters, things like that. 
[02:07:00]  Now, they're advertising one of his, you know, quote, you know, workout gigs as a real  gig.  As a Jim Norton gig.  So you, as the listener, you're going to buy tickets, assuming you can see Jim Norton.  The reality is, yeah, you can see him for maybe 10 minutes, 12 minutes, and it's going  to be material that he's working out.  And then, you know what you'll hear from those people?  Dude, I saw Norton.  It sucked.  He was up there for two seconds, and he's like working on stuff. 
[02:07:30]  That's how he gets proficient to do the gigs that he invites people to.  But he just found out that the radio station here in New York has been advertising that  he's going to be at one of these clubs.  Now, who took that upon themselves?  Somebody.  Oh, boy.  Is that what he's getting to the bottom of?  He is beyond pissed.  He yelled and screamed at one of the sales guys.  And, oh, yeah, they're giving away tickets to this, too.  Giving away tickets, like a ticket giveaway.  And then you go to see Jim for 12, 15 minutes.  Right. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at his head.  It's all red.  Hi, Jimmy.  And then he yells and screams at one of the sales guys.  And one of the sales guys had the nerve to say, I don't even know who you are.  That's good if you're selling for the radio station.  I didn't yell and scream at him.  We were just, it was like, I don't know who was to blame.  I wasn't yelling at him.  I don't know what his fault is.  I don't know.  Everybody wants to get over it.  Your workout gigs.  The things you just go to and club to club.  I'm not doing stand-up.  Done.  And they're selling those as like, hey, look, see Jim Norton.  Dude, and it's the same for all comedians. 
[02:08:30]  We all do these gigs in the city.  You love doing them.  You know, the seller.  You know, in the comedy cell, me and Colin Quinn, every comedian makes the same amount of money.  It's like you're all doing 15 minutes, 15 minutes.  Right.  It's not a major event, but you're working on material.  You're doing this, and that's why you do it for the amount of money they're paying you,  which is nothing.  Right.  Which is fine.  I don't mind.  I'm not complaining.  But when it's advertised, it becomes a thing.  It's like, no.  People think they're going to see a Jim Norton show.  Or a divorce or anybody.  Right.  Or a minister from N.E.W.  It's not just me, but I won't be a part of anything that's advertised like that because  that's not, no.  It's just, you know, you come out, you see a show.  It's not a Jim Norton show or anything. 
[02:09:00]  Right.  The listeners are not going to get their money's worth if they think they're seeing Jim Norton.  And I'm not saying that it was advertised as a Jim Norton show.  All I know is just, you know, if I'm going to, to be honest with you, I'm going to be  doing an hour at Westbury.  That's where I want people to come up and advertise it.  Yeah.  You know, and so I'm not even doing that other gig in New York.  And he was furious at me.  And he's like, you know, I don't even know who you are.  And you come up here.  I wasn't yelling at the dude.  It's like, I want to know how much, you know what I mean?  I don't know who you are.  That's fine.  I don't really care.  I don't have an ego about that.  No, it's not an ego thing.  It's a business thing.  That's like, like I said, the sales staff should know who Jim Norton is. 
[02:09:30]  And if they don't, that's fine, man.  Again, it's not a big deal.  But then just don't get pissed off when I cancel a gig that I'm going to be making absolutely  no money on to begin with.  I don't know anything about clients.  I don't care about these people.  What's that going to do with me?  The time any of them came up and go, hey, let me help you with this.  Never.  Right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm just cranky, man.  I overreact to everything.  I just called and canceled every spot I have at that club.  I'm just a complete dick.  Did you?  Everything.  Yeah.  I'm like, just cancel everything.  Click.  I just, I like to be honest, man.  All right. 
[02:10:00]  I'm a perv and I'm weird, but I'm straightforward.  Just be straight with me and that's all I ask.  All right.  Also, another side note and then we'll move on with the radio show.  There's a lot of syndication underground that is happening.  Yeah.  You know, there's a lot of fans in cities that, you know, don't get the show the traditional  way.  So, we have a lot of hardcore fans that do what we like to call syndication underground.  Right.  Will you please continue doing that?  You're not going to get in trouble.  Yeah.  You will not get in trouble. 
[02:10:30]  There's a bunch of ass wipes out there that are just bitter and they're just trying to  F with us every, any way they can.  You're not going to get in trouble if you've got the syndication underground thing happening.  Trust me on that.  Okay.  And if you do have a problem personally where maybe the company has contacted you, you get  a hold of me and I'll make it go away.  Right.  That's how it works.  A few bitter people who would align themselves and latched on to a losing horse.  And now they're very angry. 
[02:11:00]  So, they try to take it out on fans that want to listen to the show that can't get it over  the radio.  So, they go to the computer and, you know, there are people out there streaming the show.  Right.  We know it.  It's bootlegged.  And we don't know the locations or anything, but we know it's happening.  Right.  It's just the nature of the beast.  It's the internet.  It's the way it works these days.  This company will not screw over hardcore fans of the Opie and Anthony show, okay?  No.  So, don't worry about getting an email from some douchebag and thinking that that's going 
[02:11:30]  to cause you problems.  You can stream whatever you want.  Don't worry about it.  So, keep that going because there's a lot of people out there that really appreciate those  feeds until we get syndicated to those cities, okay?  Just a little bitter.  What's wrong, Jim?  We got six people in here.  Six more, we can have a rally.  We got to get to some douchebags.  What's that?  Horse manure?  Let me put that on my toothbrush.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Keep backing that nag.  All right.  That's great.  Let's talk about Tiger Woods.  Here's the official story.  This is a really big deal today.  And I don't know why.  I really don't know why.  Now, this guy that wrote this story, what's his name?  Mark Canizzaro.  Mac.  Mark.  Mac.  Mac.  Mac Canizzaro.  Zaro.  From Southgate.  He writes for the New York Post?  Yes.  And he's all upset. 
[02:12:30]  He is totally taking the politically correct angle on this whole thing.  And I think it's two different situations here.  It absolutely is.  Let me read just a little bit here.  Of course, the British Open's about to happen.  And I think they tee off tomorrow, right, for the first round.  My word.  Tiger Woods, who champions himself as a man vehemently against exclusionary policies for reasons of race or anything else, should be ashamed that the gutless straddle defense answer he delivered yesterday to a question about women not being allowed as members of Augusta National Country Club. 
[02:13:00]  Augusta is entitled to set up their own rules the way they want them, said Woods, whose early existence in golf was all about opening doors to those like himself who were excluded because of prejudice, emphasized by his first Nike TV commercial that blared against his exclusion from certain golf clubs because of the color of his skin.  Right.  Quote from Woods here.  That's the way they want to set it up.  It's their prerogative to set it up that way. 
[02:13:30]  It would be nice to see everyone have an equal chance to participate if they want to, but there's nothing you can do about it.  It's just the way it is.  Halle effin'luia.  And then he writes, just the way it is?  When there was slavery, was that just the way it is?  And that's a pretty accurate comparison.  Yeah.  A bunch of housewife hens playing golf to a whole race of people in bondage.  Good comparison, you white dope.  Really accurate comparison.  You stupid Mark, what's his name? 
[02:14:00]  Cannizzaro or whatever.  Yeah.  Who heard of him?  Black people being slaves is the same as some hole not being able to tee off at Augusta.  You jackass.  He continues this guy.  I find it shocking and appalling that somebody who has brought so much stature to the game of golf is basically saying it's all right to discriminate against humans.  Oh, that's actually Charles Farrell, the director of Rainbow Sports.  Farrell, shake it.  A division of Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Push Wall Street Project for expanded opportunities for minorities, including women in the sports industry. 
[02:14:30]  Correct.  When he first turned pro, his whole TV commercial campaign was about the places that wouldn't let him play because of race.  That was very dramatic and very effective.  And there were some clubs that had excluded blacks that opened doors to blacks because of the pressure that came from Woods' comments.  To condone discriminating against women, I think, plays right into the hands of those who would want things back the way they were before 1954. 
[02:15:00]  It's completely different, first of all.  And like we were talking about earlier, why do these women want to get in on this?  Can't there be a place that guys can go and play golf and then sit there at the clubhouse or whatever and talk about women, talk about anything without worrying about four twats sitting behind them and saying,  I was so offended by what I heard, I want these men, I'm going to file a suit against them because I was sexually harassed by having to listen to their locker room banter. 
[02:15:30]  That's what the bottom line is with this stuff.  You can't go anywhere and just talk like guys talk.  They're trying to change guys.  Maybe they have this misconception that we can walk around and not talk about sex and T's and P's. 
[02:16:00]  That's why we love doing this radio show.  Right.  We're pretty much doing locker room conversations every day.  Or to tell an off-color joke or whatever.  Right.  Just a joke.  A joke.  Right.  Some bitch will rag.  And before you know it, the place, you won't be able to talk about anything that guys talk about.  Let me clue you in, ladies.  Guys talk about nasty stuff like this all the time when they're together.  All the time.  It's joking.  It's fun. 
[02:16:30]  And when you're brought into an environment where now there's ladies in there, some guys can tame it down because you have to in certain circumstances.  But in a place like this, where it's a male country club, guys, golf course, you don't want to have to worry about that.  And bringing women in only makes it worse for the guys that want to play.  And why is it women that want to be where we are all the time?  You don't see a lot of guys trying to get into where women are hanging out. 
[02:17:00]  You know, we're not trying to get into the nail place to get our nails done.  Yeah.  You got your nail thing.  We got our golf thing.  Leave us alone.  There are some gyms.  And you know what?  And it's kind of similar in a way because these nail places, you know, it's a place where women can go, escape a little while.  Hackle.  And they can be women.  They talk about stuff maybe they wouldn't be able to talk about around other men.  So I don't think that's a crazy example because it's kind of similar.  Guys like going to a golf course. 
[02:17:30]  It's escapism.  It's like, hey, I can leave my wife at home and be by myself with the guys a little bit.  Be a man.  If you're with the guys.  It's not like you're screwing broads in the woods or anything, even though most of the guys that play golf wish that was an option.  And if you want to have a party or whatever and you want to have strippers there, let women be a part of this.  Oh, we can't have that.  That's not conducive with the atmosphere.  We want to play golf.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Let the guys just play golf.  I think golf is stupid.  If you play it, you're a zero anyway as far as I'm concerned. 
[02:18:00]  But if you want to do it with your buddies and have a good time, why is that a problem?  How about the women find a nice piece of land in Augusta and make their own little course for women only?  You have their own little golf course.  You're not going to have guys yelling and screaming and complaining going, what the F is going on?  What do I need to see?  What am I missing?  What am I missing?  What's going on there?  I got to be there.  I got to see for myself.  And guys like Voss play golf.  Do you really want to be around that animal for 18 holes?  I got to buy you a golf cart.  Smoking and hitting on you badly with wart fingers. 
[02:18:30]  Look at the first three letters in Titleist.  I got a club you can grab.  I'll hit you between the first and second hole.  I don't understand why women need to be where we are.  Well, like Norton brought up before with Citadel.  That was another one.  Military Academy.  For some reason, it's been guys forever.  And, you know, churning out some officers. 
[02:19:00]  And then the women want to get in on the act there.  And it changes everything because now you can't act like guys.  And now Citadel enrolls women, right?  She lasted, what, a week?  Yeah.  A week.  Yeah, but she got the job done.  Now there's women enrolling every effing year.  Why didn't they start their own military college for women if it was that important to them?  How come it's okay to have all male or all division or all female divisions in schools? 
[02:19:30]  Or how about if I want to change in the woman's locker room?  Well, that's not inclusive.  I mean, it's just ridiculous.  I'm not saying racially it's different, man.  But between men and women, I'm sorry, there is a gender difference.  And enough.  There truly is a difference between men and women.  Yeah.  And whoever doesn't believe that you're an A.  There's no difference between a black guy playing golf and a white guy playing golf.  You're both zeros.  But when it comes to a guy or a girl, you can't have the conversations you can have with chicks standing behind.  And it's, you know, the great equalizer there.  There are guys at the golf course at Augusta.  And they're, you know, black.  They're white.  Chinky Chinese. 
[02:20:00]  Whoever the hell wants to play golf as a guy, you go there and play golf.  And you can talk about whatever the hell you want.  And then, eh, you get that foursome cackling behind you.  What did he say?  What did he say?  Oh, my God.  I'm going and report him.  It's like, oh, stop it.  It always comes down to that.  What about this?  You think you're alone and you could kind of let your guard down a little bit at a golf course?  You're not getting, you're not doing anything too crazy.  But you're just being a man with your friends. 
[02:20:30]  And behind you is your neighbor.  And now she's going to report to your wife.  What are you doing with your buddies?  Yeah.  You know what he was doing on the golf course?  He was flirting with the beer girl.  What about taking the...  He was drinking a little too much.  He had too many cigars out there.  The treeside leak.  And you got to take a leak out on the course.  And you go there.  I saw his genitalia.  Yep.  I saw his genitalia. 
[02:21:00]  I want to hear from the women today, Ann.  And can I say...  Why is this important to you, really?  Look around your workplace.  Everybody, look around the workplace where you used to be able to work at a goddamn garage.  The goddamn corner garage where you'd bring your car in to get fixed.  Remember the toolbox?  The mechanic's toolbox would always be opened up and have the naked women pictures in there and all on the walls.  I remember as a kid, my father bringing the car in and it was like going to a strip club for an eight-year-old. 
[02:21:30]  You're in the garage and you're looking.  And I heard that it's not allowed anymore.  It's not allowed to display that even if there aren't women working.  You know all those sexual harassment pamphlets?  They call them pamphlets even though they're textbooks.  Yeah.  That every single one of us that is listening right now has to read?  Mm-hmm.  It wasn't a man that put that in motion.  No.  Women wanted to be included in the man's world as it was known back in the day. 
[02:22:00]  Business, workplace, jobs that normally were men's jobs.  They wanted to be included.  They fought for it.  They got in.  And what did they do?  They took away everything that, or a lot of things that guys enjoyed at the workplace as far as displaying nude pictures,  running off the jokes on the copy machine and throwing them around to each other, just talking like guys talk.  Can't do any of that.  No, you will be after. 
[02:22:30]  It wasn't a guy that complied.  You will be sued.  Financially, you will be ruined.  And you won't be able to get a job again.  It has done nothing.  I think everyone knows that we don't have real jobs here at this radio station.  But we have to watch our back.  When girls come in for the WOW Contest and stuff, there's a whole process that has to happen.  We have to lock doors and put up signs.  Warning, warning, warning.  You might be seeing something that you don't want to see.  When we watch videos in the office.  When we want to watch our porno and the stuff we do to get ready for this stupid radio show, we have to lock our own office door. 
[02:23:00]  Take our clothes off.  Yeah.  I help you.  You help me.  We all laugh.  Yeah.  This isn't white-collar work around here.  We're a bunch of scumbags and we have to worry about this crap.  It's not like we're working for IBM or something.  And I would even argue that it's wrong in those environments, but what the hell.  And then, you know, the Army is another issue, too.  The Army, soldiers, man. 
[02:23:30]  These guys are, you know, hardcore.  They talk a certain way and they, you know, like their pinups and whatnot.  And then the women get in there and, you know, if the women are going to come in and be just like the guys, just like they said, look, we should be equal, we should be.  But, no, they come in and then want to tear down everything that makes the guys guys and try to make it like, no, believe us, it's better for you.  You don't want to talk that way or be that way or enjoy looking at this or listening to that. 
[02:24:00]  No, this is better because we say so.  So we're going to make it and push until it's a law that you will be screwed and get in trouble if you say this or â€“  How about this one?  We've been forced to let â€“ and this is a big one because I played a lot of sports.  We forced â€“ we're forced to allow women in the locker rooms while you're walking around naked and crap.  Yeah, for sports.  You know, I mean, you know, after an NFL game or something, these guys are sweaty and naked and they're in their environment where they kind of feel comfortable. 
[02:24:30]  And now they have to, you know, worry because there's a â€“  Ew, girls.  Chicks â€“ I love women.  No, I know.  No, it's not like it's an effing Playboy model with, you know, a steno pad.  No, it's like Penny Crone looking women.  They're awful.  You don't want to be naked in front of these women.  And you know what?  If you are, you could possibly be brought up on something.  Right.  What are you doing with your junk out in front of a woman in your locker room? 
[02:25:00]  Dude, chicks are not fun.  I love women.  But you know what, ladies?  You're not fun to hang out with.  When I go out with â€“ oh, we joke.  We laugh.  We laugh.  Me and you.  We laugh.  We point at chicks.  Ah, look at her ass.  A girl is â€“ oh, that's that.  They're not funny.  Women don't tell really good, filthy jokes.  They don't have great cancer references.  They just sit there and â€“  Telling a story.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's really mean.  You shouldn't â€“ just shut up.  When I need you, I'll throw you 50. 
[02:25:30]  You can drink them and get out.  Hey, this is Jim's â€“  No, I'm not â€“ I love women.  I still want to get laid.  That's Jim's â€“  No, no, you know what I'm talking about, man.  I was actually pointing at Ant when I was saying Ant for that because we were out.  You're just talking like guys, man.  You talk like guys.  And I love women, but stop â€“ when you overemphasize all this stuff,  you take away the validity of the real â€“ sexual harassment is wrong.  You should be able to work on it being sexually harassed.  But if a guy says, hey, that's a nice skirt,  and you bring him up on sexual harassment charges,  you wonder why nobody wants to listen to anything you say. 
[02:26:00]  Well, tell me.  What did you have for breakfast?  I can smell it.  You know, we're all high-fiving.  We get books of things you can and you can't do in the workplace,  and they're ridiculous, like things that you wouldn't even think about.  If you're going to websites on your computer and something pops up,  a pop-up ad pops up, not even on a porno site,  but there's a pop-up ad that might be a little bit provocative that comes up. 
[02:26:30]  If there's a woman walking by and she sees that on your screen,  in your space, you can be brought up on charges, sexual harassment charges.  Because they love to be victims.  That's why you don't get the respect you want.  Stop thinking like a second-class citizen and a victim.  Stop.  Right.  Aggravating.  I mean, again, real sexual harassment is one thing.  You should not have to deal with that at work.  I don't mean that.  Of course.  You know, I don't want my girl and my wife being hassled by some dirt guy either. 
[02:27:00]  I would guess, out of 100 sexual harassment charges,  one is authentic.  Maybe even out of 1,000, there's one boss that's going,  F me and I'll give you the promotion.  You know?  Most of them are, I told a joke, I complimented her,  I talked to her, you know, in a certain way.  It's not, I'm your boss, you're the subordinate, 
[02:27:30]  you suck it.  You know?  Most of them are dopey jokes and fun that, for some reason,  there's a problem with.  I don't mind what you think they were here this pre...  Save that for after the break.  Okay.  We got a lot of ladies really pissed at us.  That's cool.  We'll talk to you next.  Don't hang up.  We'll give you your equal time.  The phones have just exploded.  One girl, maybe this is why not a lot of women listen to you guys. 
[02:28:00]  Well, we'll talk to...  If you're too busy kvetching and bellyaching somewhere else,  then don't listen, you hole.  And they don't listen because...  I have done nothing but chase women from this program.  Ah.  Not true, actually.  This rating, surprisingly, we have a lot more women listening to us  than last time.  Exactly, but look at her trying to...  Now you wonder why gals don't listen.  We'll see what she has to say.  The phones have exploded.  All right, I'm sorry.  So why don't we take a quick break and we'll see where this goes.

[02:39:00]  Phones have exploded.  Want to explain, Anthony, the Tiger Woods thing?  Yeah, it seems Tiger Woods is all for keeping ladies out of Augusta. 
[02:39:30]  It's been lady-free since, what, 19...  How long has that been around, that club?  Forever.  Forever, right?  Like the 1800s or something?  When they were smacking the little bull around with a wooden stick?  And now women want to get involved.  It's, uh...  There are some, uh, last bastions of a place men can go and talk dirty. 
[02:40:00]  Or just to hang out, smoke cigar, whatever.  Without having to worry about saying something inappropriate that's going to get them brought up on a lawsuit or charges or fired or whatever.  You know, sometimes we just want to be guys.  Guys are, you know something?  When a bunch of guys get together...  We're only watching our backs in today's society.  When a bunch of guys get together, it gets, uh, ugly sometimes. 
[02:40:30]  The talking...  You know?  We talk about these things, ladies.  It happens.  And now, when they want to...  Look at...  Yeah, if only all the ladies that were at the Buffalo show.  See, those are good ladies.  They don't care.  Well, let's go right to the phones.  Uh, Victoria, what's going on?  Hi, how are you? 
[02:41:00]  Pretty good.  First, I have a couple of points to say.  Yeah.  All the women that are calling complaining about this crap, they're stupid.  We live in a man's world.  If you want to work in corporate and you want to play with the boys, you've got to act like the boys.  I don't get the whole sexual harassment crap.  I got a CD sent to me.  You have to know how to handle yourself.  If you can't handle yourself, you shouldn't be working.  You should be at home with the kids.  There are some...  There are occasions that women are definitely getting sexually harassed at work.  Without a doubt.  We don't want to make light of that. 
[02:41:30]  No, but wait.  You know what?  I understand that.  And if you want to put it, quote, unquote, I've been in that situation.  But you have to know how to handle yourself.  You can't take it to heart.  You can't take it.  Oh, I'm going to sue you just because you told me I had a nice ass.  Yeah, but you know something?  There are some legitimate complaints that women have.  And when I remember, the first time I ever heard of sexual harassment at the workplace,  it was pretty much the guy was the boss.  The woman was either the secretary or an underling something. 
[02:42:00]  And there was the, do this for me, and I will promote you.  That, to me, is sexual harassment.  Having a desk calendar that might have some provocative drawings on it or pictures or sayings.  Or, God forbid, women in bikinis, even.  Things like that, right?  Having a calendar in your cubicle that might have a girl in bikini.  Or, screw it, I don't care, a Playboy picture.  Something like that.  There is no reason that a guy can't have that in the workplace just because a woman is offended by this. 
[02:42:30]  I agree.  No, suck it up.  There's small cases of which sexual harassment actually exists.  Right.  The rest of the time, it's stupidity.  Well, you know what the problem is, Toots?  Nobody is talking about the legitimate cases.  But when you constantly bring out the calendar, like Ann said, or the little, oh, he sent me a joke in the email.  That's harassment.  That demeans the real cases.  And people don't want to hear it from anybody anymore.  And for some reason, no one has any sense. 
[02:43:00]  The judges and stuff that handle these things, they don't have sense because it snowballs, just like everything else.  And there's nobody to take the opposite end of it because you come off sounding like, you know, an ass saying, hey, screw that.  There shouldn't be these sexual harassment laws.  So it just keeps snowballing to the point that it is now.  All right.  Walt from New York City on the instant feedback.  The best was that stupid hooker of a sports reporter that went into the Patriots locker room and was offended by the naked man.  How many men can go into Anna Kornikova's dressing room? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, where's that?  Yeah.  Where's that equal opportunity?  Exactly.  Or how many are you not even allowed to stab Steffi Graf?  Becky, what's going on?  Hey, how are you?  No, no, no.  I got you back to the Hinkley thing.  And you know what?  I was going to let you just fly, but you had to question the joke.  I caught it.  I was wrong.  I knew I was wrong.  Who was it?  Monica Seles?  It was Seles.  Okay, but I admitted it.  I'm wrong, ladies.  Becky, what's going on?  Hey, how are you?  All right.  I just, I think, I do think most women take this, like, way too far. 
[02:44:00]  I, but you guys started saying, you know, women are no fun, and that's why you don't like to hang out with us, and I'm totally the opposite.  Well, you know, Norton was just ranting and raving.  You know, there's.  No, I meant it.  They're not, I love women, but they're not fun like guys to hang with.  I'm sorry, ladies.  Loosen up.  Oh, see, that's where you're wrong.  I know plenty of women who are fun like guys.  I am really feminine, but I can belt with the best of them.  I like wings and beer.  Yeah, but you know what?  I know what Jim is saying. 
[02:44:30]  That's great that you can hang with the guys, but I just figured out what Jim's saying.  I love my time to myself, and, like, there are times, like, I'll hang with Norton and a few other comedians, and we'll just kind of, you know, hang out at a comedy club and then walk the streets a little bit, and we're just being, you know, dopey guys, and we don't have to worry about, you know, women being around for a few hours, right?  Yeah, and I don't mean you have to belch and be a guy.  Keep your feminine, or I would say femininity, I think is the word.  You don't have to become masculine to be fun, but just with the senses of humor, they tend to differ, and I turn women off with my sense of humor. 
[02:45:00]  I don't turn off, oh, or Ben or Ant, we're all hanging, but if there's a girl there sometimes...  You know, I'm watching your back.  You're just letting it hang out.  You shouldn't have to watch your back like that in the workplace.  If you're being aggressively harassing to a girl on the job, absolutely, you're wrong.  The girl has a case.  If you are just being a guy at work, and the girl is now filing some kind of a lawsuit against you, that is completely wrong.  It's ridiculous. 
[02:45:30]  Like, dude, it's all of a sudden, it's a crime now.  Like, if you happen to notice camel toe, to point at it and just, like, show everybody, ah, look at her.  And point at her camel toe and maybe call her a whore or something.  All of a sudden, that's, like, a problem.  Now we're moving into the whole sexual harassment thing, but we want to also focus on why women feel like they need to be part of our special clubs and stuff as well, okay?  The whole sexual harassment thing we could talk about for another hour.  Who's this?  Deedon? 
[02:46:00]  Deedon.  What's your name?  My name?  Yes.  My name is Dean the Cop.  I'm from Jersey.  Hi, Angel.  Why would Stinky think there's someone out there called Deedon?  Deedon's on the phone.  I've never heard of a Deedon.  Hi, Deedon.  He's been smoking pot since, like, 3 in the morning.  He's high.  We know it's Dean now.  Now he's thinking of writing back at me.  I hit the wrong button.  I'm sorry.  That's because he retarded.  Hi, Dean.  Dean the Cop.  There it is.  Listen to what happened to my father-in-law.  Yes.  He worked for a stage in Jersey. 
[02:46:30]  He was an investigator.  He caught this girl screwing around, and she beat him to the punch, and she filed a sexual harassment suit against him.  She cleared about 25 Gs, and they fired him, and about six months later, he died.  And here's the kicker.  She's about 425 pounds.  What did she claim happened?  She said he was looking at her breasts and saying stuff to her.  I swear to God, I saw this girl.  She's about 425 pounds. 
[02:47:00]  She's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life.  It was disgusting.  He wound up having a heart attack over it.  And the state agency, they forced him to resign, and they gave the girl 25 Gs, and it was like a hush-hush thing.  Oh, Dean.  Thank you.  Right.  Thank you, Dedan.  Yeah.  You guys rule.  Norton, you rule.  Thanks, Angel.  All right.  Bye, bye.  Bye, buddy.  Dedan.  Oh, my God.  Even though he's maybe not the best storyteller, but that's still a point, though. 
[02:47:30]  It's like, you know, it's like no matter what you do, they're going to all automatically assume guilty.  Next thing you know, women are going to want to go out with us and start, like, raping and wilding.  It's like, ladies, some things are just ours.  Let us have them.  Anthony.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Norton.  Hey, Ant.  What's up, buddy?  Not this ant.  You guys are a mess.  Listen, the bottom line is they hate us having time for ourselves.  It's gotten to the point where I'm getting invitations for wedding showers and baby showers that invite men.  God forbid we have a couple hours to ourselves where these women go over to their houses, open up the stupid packages of rattles and baby wipes and diapers for what? 
[02:48:00]  Why are they inviting men to baby showers?  We don't want to go.  Keep an eye on you.  That's our opportunity to go to the strip club.  Is that what it's called?  What are they called?  Jack and Jill parties?  Yeah.  That's only funny if you punch her in the stomach and she breaks her water.  When she comes to me with the invitation, I'm like, when she comes to me about the invitation, I'm like, I'm not going.  I'm not going to any of these things. 
[02:48:30]  It's a women's company and that's it.  I stay home.  I'll tell you why they do it.  Because they, A, want to be invited to our things.  They figure, well, if I invite him to this, he'll have to invite me.  And here's one of the problems.  How many times have you wanted to watch the game?  They're called Jack and Jill parties.  They're awful.  They have bachelorette parties.  I can't get over Rick knew that.  Yeah.  You've been to a Jack and Jill party?  Have you been to a Jack and Jill party?  You've been to a Jack and Jill party?  Actually, no.  No, I haven't been.  But I hear about it.  Because, you know, when I was engaged and everything, they would throw that out.  That's an option.  I'm like, I'm not doing that.  That's stupid.  And Linda agreed. 
[02:49:00]  She didn't want to hang out with the guys.  Is there anything more boring for a guy than going through...  You, Jill, and I'll Jack.  Yeah, I'm supposed to go out there and go, oh, look at the cute little booties.  Oh, look at Toaster.  I love this.  Anything more boring than going through pictures of a bridal shower or a baby shower?  No.  Going through pictures.  You're like going, oh, thank God I wasn't there.  They just look like the worst things to be at.  Hey, and you know what, ladies, you should admit it, most of you are miserable at those  things anyway. 
[02:49:30]  Oh.  I got invited to one, and I guarantee you, this is how you stop it.  When you have to bring a gift, bring for the baby a plastic baggie.  They will never invite you to another one.  Crinkle, crinkle.  See you later, guys.  No, I don't mean to stand.  I mean to put over their heads.  That's funny, too, though.  Yeah, I know.  A little crinkle, crinkle bag.  Yeah, one is really...  One of the little ones that you put the little birthday presents in with the balloon.  Fabio.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Before I get to what I called, I've been getting here with these, you know, guys are invited 
[02:50:00]  to the baby showers lately, and there's always one guy who goes that ruins it for everyone.  Yeah, well, Bob is going.  Yeah, the good husband.  The good boyfriend ruins it for all of us.  Exactly.  But I'm wrong because, you know, I don't generally have a problem with women.  In general, we're awful.  Now, one goody two-shoe guy ruins it for all of us.  God, I have so many of those stories.  The reason about...  Well, Johnny went.  Well, Johnny's not having an extramarital affair, stupid.  Johnny's a douche. 
[02:50:30]  But I don't have a problem with women joining...  Johnny's a douche.  I don't have a problem with women joining women's men's clubs, but only...  And I have a problem with the rules change, like when they allow women into the fire department.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, the test became easier because it was unfair to women.  Right, they made the test easier so women could be...  There are certain jobs that just need brute strength that the majority of the women don't have as compared to the men.  You get somebody like, you know, China out there lifting fire hoses and whatnot or carrying a body out. 
[02:51:00]  Of course, she can do it.  But most of the women that were signing up didn't have the physical strength.  So what do they do?  They change the test.  Do you want to be the guy that's burning in a building and a woman goes up there and she can't carry you out?  No.  No.  Of course not.  And you know, it could be even like some weak guy that normally wouldn't have made the test.  And he wouldn't have made it either.  You'd throw him out too.  If I'm in a building, I want a fireman who's a hunk.  I want a big beefcake to carry me out over my shoulders. 
[02:51:30]  Little Jimmy with his arms wrapped around his neck, looking lovingly into his eyes.  Around his toes.  A little sticker on the window he knew to come in for me.  The top finder.  The officer and the gentleman music playing in the background.  His neck smells like smoke, but I give his kiss on the cheek.  Not that it's gay, but I'm grateful and things happen.  You've got the FDNY hat on your head, tilted just slightly to the side.  Why, schnooker?  He's not wearing any shirt, just his suspenders and pants.  All your neighbors yelling, go, Jimmy, go. 
[02:52:00]  The officer and the gentleman.  Lift us up where we belong.  Oh, that's an awful vision.  Right.  Where did that come from?  Why did it go on so long?  I don't know.  It just kept getting harder and harder.  Danny, what's up?  Hi.  Danny, a girl.  Yes.  No, I'm a girl.  I'm actually engaged and I just went to my stupid bridal shower this past week. 
[02:52:30]  And let me tell you, just because I'm a girl, they're not fun.  Right.  They suck, actually.  I said that.  And no man should ever be subjected to them.  I think as a guy, when we have to look at those pictures, we can see it on your faces as you're all sitting around in a big circle.  That big circle with the one color, the blue or the pink, everything is.  And they're opening things up and you see the woman that they're having the party for just going, ooh, click.  Ah, click.  It's fake.  We're lying.  Find gifts for some kid that's probably going to get driven into a lake anyway. 
[02:53:00]  Very nice, Norton.  It happened again in another place.  It certainly did.  Well, you guys are right.  And they stink.  And be glad you're not female so you're not obliged to go.  All right.  Thank you.  Have a good day.  Take care, Cookie.  Bye.  Hey, what happened to the lady that was really pissed at us?  She didn't hold on.  Impatient.  Exactly.  A man would have held on.  Oh, here's one.  This is what you want to hear from your lady.  Alice, go ahead.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good. 
[02:53:30]  You guys are awesome.  I love you guys.  Thank you, Alice.  I've been listening for a while and you guys are just awesome.  I'm calling from Virginia.  I agree with you guys most of the time.  You guys are awesome.  And you guys had me in tears on my way home from work.  But I have to disagree with you on this one because I think they should let women in.  But I think that if the women want to hang with the guys, then they have to deal with  what the guys are saying.  Yeah.  It's just like the girls that go to strip clubs and don't like what they're saying.  You know.  Why go?  Why go?  It's like if you're going to go, have a good time.  I've been there. 
[02:54:00]  It's a blast.  I've had a good time.  Yep.  You're right.  But, you know, it's a whole BS that, you know, oh, I didn't like what I saw.  Well, shut up.  Then don't be there.  You know what?  You're right.  I mean, you sound like a good tomato, but I mean, a lot of the girls would join the  club and get pissed off.  But you're right.  If you want to join and be like the guys, cool.  Join.  Got a nice set of stems, Alice.  Yeah.  I mean, you don't like to have great gams.  Well, you know, I don't know.  I just I think it's just I have friends that, you know, it's they complain and moan and  bitch about the guys.  Oh, I'm sorry.  They complain about them going to the strip club.  I'm like, I'm like, I don't care. 
[02:54:30]  My husband got go.  I don't care.  Get out of my hair.  Yeah.  Cool.  So I don't know.  That's all I had to say.  They should let them join.  But, you know, if you're going to you're going to be there, you got to listen to it.  And that's it.  All right.  Have a good night, guys.  I can't find the officer and gentleman music.  That's five minutes of radio.  Jeez, that bitch went on and on.  Big Al, what's going on?  Check it up, fellas.  Check it up.  Hey, oh, you were just talking about that one guy that ruins it for everyone else.  Yeah.  Wasn't Rick at Royhead, Rick, that guy when he dragged you and Sandy to that costume fondue 
[02:55:00]  party around Halloween?  Yep.  No, I, Rick.  Robert, Ricky to y'all.  No, well, you bring up a good point.  Rick hangs out with a very nice group of people and they're all really nice couples and they  like to do very faggy things, but it seems like they all enjoy it.  Fondue parties and carving the pumpkin parties.  And I even, I even see it.  Look at Rick's face.  I see it in Rick's face that he doesn't want to be part of some of these things, but he's 
[02:55:30]  a good guy.  I'm not a good, I am not a good boyfriend.  I am the worst.  All I want is to get laid and eat sandwiches.  That's it.  I don't want to go to fondue parties.  I don't want to carve pumpkins.  I don't want to go to Jack and Jill parties.  Neither does Rick.  I said that.  I, I, I, I see it in his eyes.  He's not going to say anything on the air, but I think he gets rooked into some things  where the, where all, there was one time all the couples got together to go see a Harry  Potter.  Harry Potter.  All right.  Do you guys drive? 
[02:56:00]  Do you want to come with us?  No, no.  We're going to go.  And I wasn't, and I wasn't being social enough online to get into the theater and I had  to hear it the whole way home.  Really?  How awful I am and why I can't be social.  You weren't being social with the people that you were with online?  And I like everybody, but I, you know, they were all, we talked about this on the air.  They were all discussing the book.  I, it was, it was just, you know, it was a simple thing.  I didn't read the book.  Right.  So I was out of the conversation.  That's why I like it.  And I got, and, and, and my, and, and Sandy got pissed off at me. 
[02:56:30]  But you go.  Why can't you be more social like, like the rest of the couples we were hanging with?  But you went pumpkin picking.  I try to do some things here and there.  Sure.  But that wasn't like a thing where a bunch of guys and a bunch of girls went pumpkin  picking.  No.  No.  That's what you do if you're a Peanuts cartoon character.  At least I respect the fact that you didn't read the Harry Potter book.  You shouldn't have.  When people are talking about Harry Potter, you know what you should do?  You should just look off into the distance.  You know what, though?  They made it, they made me feel like I, why didn't I read this thing?  Like it was stupid.  Yes, they did.  Well, I'm, I'm here for you. 
[02:57:00]  No, you shouldn't have read it.  They made me feel like, I, you are, I'm thinking to myself, you are awful.  Well, Rick didn't read it, right?  You are so awful.  He read it.  Oh, yeah, he did.  He read it.  I knew he did when I said that.  I just wanted to see him.  I'll tell you why, though.  Why?  Because of all the damn hype the book was getting.  It's like, all right, if every, if everybody's saying this.  What kind of hype was Harry Potter reading?  Rick, it's okay.  Jim, you haven't heard of anything.  It's okay that Rick read the book.  I'm not, I'm not.  But no, I, I'm like, all right, let me read this, this stupid book. 
[02:57:30]  And, you know, they say it's quick.  And I got done with it pretty quick.  But it actually, it ruins the movie.  Because then you're like, oh, well, they didn't do this.  And this looked like crap.  Ruins the Harry Potter movie.  Couldn't put it down, by the way, means I got through it quick.  Couldn't put it down.  I got through it quick.  Real page turner.  Did Harry Potter's family give hubcaps for Christmas?  All right.  That's another story.  Geez, that's funny.  Later, schnookums.  All right.  Oh, no.  I don't know.  Sandy.  Hi.  Hi.  Who am I talking to? 
[02:58:00]  Is that a joke?  No.  If it was, that's really good.  It's G.H.  No, I.  Oh, hey, G.H.  Sandy, you enjoyed pumpkin picking.  I didn't.  So, we've talked about it on the air.  That's not, it was okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, and you were like fighting with me over, get the bigger pumpkin.  Get the bigger pumpkin.  Can you get, Sandy?  The bigger pumpkin.  Could you repeat that?  Get the bigger pumpkin.  He was encouraging you to get the bigger pumpkin? 
[02:58:30]  Yes.  Oh, look at that one over there.  Hell, if you're going to go pumpkin picking, you might as well give it your all.  And you had fun.  I did not deny that, yes.  Not only that.  That was okay.  That was a good day out in the country.  Not only that.  You switched off a Mets playoff game to do that, dude.  No, you didn't.  No, no.  No, the signal went out because we had to go very far out east to the good pumpkin patch.  Well, that's where the good patch is.  The ones in Huntington weren't good enough where I live.  We had to go all the way out east.  No, because we had to be able to get the wagon. 
[02:59:00]  If we could, we would have made it all the way to England.  Oh, right.  Because the places near you didn't have the wagon.  We needed the wagon.  The red wagon that they give you to pull through the pumpkin field to load up your pumpkin.  Oh.  And we had to be able to take the pictures behind the big cutouts.  The big cutout, the wooden cutout that has painted faces on it, where you put your head  through and go, look, I'm in a house.  I'm a big pumpkin.  I'm a big pumpkin.  There it is.  Well, look at the picture of it.  What else do you get with your pumpkin?  AZT?  That stinks. 
[02:59:30]  Give me look.  Look at that picture.  Oh, my God.  That is awful.  See how cute he looks?  He is kind of cute, but you're pulling up pumpkin wagons.  See, Jim, this is what I used to do before I met you.  Oh, man, am I glad you're not behaving that way anymore.  Oh, just wait till fall.  No, dude, I'm not being a fag or nothing, but they don't have the wagons and the pumpkins  are bigger than the other place.  I'm sorry.  I won't settle for small pumpkins and no wagons.  All right, Sam, you got to go because girlfriends and wives on the radio make awful radio.  I'm really happy she called in. 
[03:00:00]  I mean, you were good, but let's keep it to a minute.  All right, I just had to state my case.  Don't want to burn you out.  I had to state my case.  Later.  Bye.  You did very good, but you know how it is.  I can't get her.  Hate, hate, hate radio shows with wives and girlfriends on the air.  Hate it.  You didn't have a cute little name to call her when you signed off there?  When you hung up?  Yeah.  No?  Cuddle a...  I have a few if Rick would leave the studio for a minute.  Oh, gee.  Oh, man. 
[03:00:30]  Cuddle a monster.  Oof.  Jesus Christ.  But no, it's good.  She called in for like two minutes and she hardly ever calls in.  That's great.  Two minutes is fine.  Five minutes is fine.  She's not going to call in every day and be annoying.  No.  No.  That's why we had to put an end to that right there.  Okay.  That would drag the whole thing down.  Day in, day out, day in.  Ugh, please.  Enough.  Next thing you know, we're doing an appearance and only 13 people show up.  Right.  You don't understand what happened.  Right.  That includes the...  Here he is. 
[03:01:00]  He's in the house.  He's in the little pumpkin house.  That's really you, dude.  Where he's making little pumpkin pies.  And a pumpkin hizzy.  And carving little pumpkins for his pumpkin friends.  And there's a little painted, tall, skinny, elf-like man.  It's Photoshop.  Photoshop.  He can do a lot of things with Photoshop these days.  Sure.  You're in the Harvey's farm.  You're in the little...  He's in the little pumpkin house.  The little pumpkin house.  He stayed there all night waiting for the gray pumpkin.  Did you have to wait on line for your picture to be taken? 
[03:01:30]  That is...  Was there a line?  See, the next time she says I'm an awful boyfriend, I'm going to remind her of this pumpkin thing.  That would confirm it.  The fact that you would agree to that.  That is horrible.  There are many occasions I'm being told I'm awful because I don't hang out and do the fondue thing.  And she couldn't understand why I wasn't carving the pumpkin at Rick's house.  Look at this Grapes of Wrath shot.  He's like...  Dude, I'd rather have my picture taken with my tongue and the sales guy's bologna.  It could be arranged. 
[03:02:00]  On the Grapes of Wrath.  That is really awful.  Pulling a little wagon.  That's great.  I want to apologize to all our listeners that my girlfriend was on the air today.  You're apologizing for that?  Yeah, it won't happen anytime soon, okay?  It was quick and to the point.  Boom, boom.  She got the hint.  Boom, boom.  In and out.  She didn't call you like Pookie or nothing or Schnookums and then you sign off and...  Give your chin a little pinch.  Call her Lovey Love or something, no?  Love you.  Love you.  Something like that? 
[03:02:30]  No.  No.  That's great stuff.  She calls me Meal Ticket.  So do I.  All right, we got a break.  The phones have still exploded.  What?  That Photoshop stuff is hilarious.  People are really funny, man.  Love you, Rick.  Love you, Ben.  Okay.  We got some great calls on hold.  Don't go anywhere, please.  Please.  We want to talk about the women and the men thing. 
[03:03:00]  Women and men when men were oysters.  You hear?  I hear me.  And also, when we get back, a new bit from Steve from foundrymusic.com and John.  Jim Norton's no request radio show.  Oh.  Oh.  We'll listen to that in just a bit.  Oh.  Opie and Anthony.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be brass.  Boobs.  Wow.  And we.  W.  He may have actually been talking into a sausage.

It's Whip'em Out Wednesday on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We don't want to forget that ever!  We're taking a lot of calls from people getting wowed.  We've learned isn't the most exciting radio. 
[03:13:00]  We know it's happening.  We get calls around the clock that it's happening.  Right.  We get pictures of it happening.  Thank you.  Thanks for supporting the show with the wow thing, ladies.  Ready, steady.  You see a wow in a car,  that guy or girl would love to see you flash them on the way home from work.  Simple as that.  It's easy.  You need a wow sticker in the New York City area?  The mother of the way.  We ask you to send us a self-addressed stamped envelope  and we send out the wow stickers.

[03:13:30]  Aight.  Aight.  If you're listening to us,  you can't get your hands on a local wow sticker,  make a homemade one, all right?  Just make it.  We're off track again.  What happened?  Well, we wanted to do the Tiger Woods thing  and talk about other ways women are forcing their way into men's lives.  Yeah. 
[03:14:00]  As far as special clubs and things go.  And now we're talking about my girlfriend.  Andrew.  Hey, Ope.  Yeah.  I just wanted to remind everybody that you left Sandy in a burning car once.  Was it burning, Opey?  It was smoking, right?  Well, like my buddy brother Wee said,  when you're in a really bad car accident,  you got to check your own ass out first to make sure you're all right,  and then you help out the loved ones.  Then you become the hero?  Right.  I only thought that Sandy called in after she caught you jacking it. 
[03:14:30]  All right, man.  I was in a pretty bad car accident last summer.  You guys got T-boned.  I broke my nose.  I was the only one that got, well, no, everyone got banged up pretty good,  but I had the worst injury, a broken nose.  And all the airbags went off, and I don't know if you've ever been in an accident.  It was my first one, thank God.  It gets quite smoky because I guess the airbags are packed with, what, powder or something?  It's like cornstarch type stuff, yeah. 
[03:15:00]  So, you know, when those damn things go off, it looks like the car is on fire inside  because it's a lot of powder that looks like smoke.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So I was completely freaked out and shaking really bad, and I jumped out to check my own  crap and then realized my girlfriend was still in the car.  Yes.  Didn't you just look at the back window and see her face, like, looking at you through  the closed window?  Yeah, she was pounding on the glass.  Banging on the glass.  Our door wouldn't open, so she had to climb out the front, the front driver's side.  That's funny.  He leaves her running out.  I would think you would turn around and say, hey, are you okay? 
[03:15:30]  Like, still in the vehicle.  You would think, Anthony.  But when you're in that situation, you're like, holy S, I almost died.  Get me out of this vehicle.  You forget about everything around you.  What's her name?  You just want, it's pretty much, I'll be honest, you know, call me a scumbag.  It's pretty much every man for themselves at that point.  And then, thank God everyone was okay.  And of course, we're talking only a matter of seconds, by the way. 
[03:16:00]  Every man for themselves.  I'm out.  Okay, now what can I do?  Oh my God, she's still in there.  I poked my head in and said, this way, ladies.  But I guess that wasn't good enough for some people.  This way, ladies.  Well, because they're doors.  You say when you open the door to a restaurant.  Not an accident.  Whatever.  But yeah, their doors were jammed.  How'd you find out she was okay?  Did she talk to her on a cell an hour later?  I'm home safe.  Are you all right?  Home.  That was a freaky thing happened today, huh?  Yeah.  You okay?  Yeah.  Bring the car around. 
[03:16:30]  All right.  Back to the phones.  Monica, what's going on?  Nothing.  I just called to, that I had to say that you guys are right.  Women should not be trying to get into guys' clubs.  And Rick should really go home and kick his girlfriend's ass for embarrassing him on the air.  Rick.  Are you familiar with this program?  Yeah.  How long have you been listening?  Well, actually, you guys, a friend of mine turned me on to you guys this week. 
[03:17:00]  Ah.  See, that wasn't Rick.  Hey, you know what, though?  That's okay.  That means we're getting new listeners.  We enjoy that.  But let me just set you straight.  That was Opie's girlfriend.  Oh, was it?  I'm sorry.  Yes.  And why did he say you have to listen to this program?  He was like, Monica, because I work in a place where it's like 57 guys were all mechanics,  and I'm the only female.  Uh-oh.  And I know, but you don't understand.  I agree with the fact that women take things too literal.  You have to be able to have fun.  You know, there's boundaries that you can't go over. 
[03:17:30]  But, you know, as an individual, I think you know the limits.  But for to be, you know, screaming out or...  Oh, hey, hey, hey.  Monica?  Yeah.  Hey, hey, hey.  Monica?  You can't use the T word.  Yeah, let me fill you in on another little aspect of the show.  There's FCC rules we must adhere to in that T word.  And you guys don't have a bleeper for that?  That's a no-no.  We got all sorts of things in place.  Yeah, we bleeped you out for that.  Took care of that. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, okay.  You want to give a shootout today?  Because it sounds like you're a ghetto mama.  Actually, no.  If any other guys in my shop are listening to me, they know that this is the way I think.  Are you a Latina?  Yes.  Oh, yes, she is.  We'll give you a shootout.  You've got a big old booty.  I can hear it.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  I can hear that in a tone of your voice.  Well, from now on, believe me.  Every afternoon, I've been listening to you guys.  You made me crack up yesterday with Francine. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, God.  That was hysterical.  Yeah, we don't know what to do with her yet.  The jury's still out.  I don't know if it's going to be a hit or not on this show.  Well, it was just hysterical, the fact that you kept just replaying her, going, ah, ah.  All right, Monica.  Good luck, guys.  There goes Monica.  Bye, Monica.  The one that is easily amused.  Gina, what's going on?  Gina.  Hello.  Gina.  Sorry to make you wait so long.  What's up?  That's okay.  Actually, I'm kind of late to my grad class, so I'll make this quick. 
[03:19:00]  Okay.  I agree with you.  I think that if the girls can't take being around the guys and them talking dirty, then they  got to get out.  Right.  I was a male-dominated sport in high school and college, and, you know, I heard all the  wisecracks and all the dirty jokes, and, you know, I took it, but I was sexually harassed  on the job one.  Oh, you were?  Really?  Yes.  Very badly, actually.  What did he do?  He felt me up. 
[03:19:30]  Wow.  Oh, he did.  Yeah.  What were you wearing to provoke that?  Shut up.  I wasn't wearing nothing.  Wait.  I was 22 years old.  I didn't know any better.  Wait.  Could you please tell the story, Jim?  I'm sorry.  So, what happened?  What do you mean?  I was 22.  I was just out of college, and I was an administrative assistant, and he was my, you know, my male  boss, and he would come up to me behind me, rub my shoulders.  Oh, that's so far so good. 
[03:20:00]  Okay.  Everything seemed pretty normal.  Pretty normal, yeah.  Um, he would put his hands, like, down my shoulder, like, down the front of my shirt.  Yeah.  Like, across my boobs.  And then, um, when he called me into his office to give me, like, directions or whatever of  what he wanted to do, he would make me stand there and watch porno.  Oh, it's not funny.  No, it's not. 
[03:20:30]  It's not.  It's 22?  I didn't know any better.  Come on.  No, that's really not funny.  That's awful.  Okay.  That's awful.  Well, Gina, I mean, you should have told Tony.  You know how jealous he gets.  And have you forgiven him for shooting Manny?  You're very funny.  All right, Gina.  All right.  That's, that's not funny at all.  It's not.  That isn't.  No.  Well, it's 22.  It's not.  You want to know better than to just sit there and let him rub you like that, too.  Next time, Stan. 
[03:21:00]  You know what?  I think, I think you should be flattered.  He obviously thought you were hot and sexy.  Yeah.  I don't think the guy should, uh, get off the hook, either.  That guy was Ken Stevens.  I just want it known to everybody out there, because he did the same thing to us in his  office once during a meeting.  Yeah, man.  He did.  We were sexually harassed by our own GM Ken Stevens once.  Yes, we were.  Isn't this harassment?  We're employees.  We were sitting in the chairs in his office, and, uh, I guess we had good ratings, and he 
[03:21:30]  came up to us.  Was that the reason?  And he went up to Opie and grabbed his shoulders and started massaging his shoulders, doing that  little squeeze thing?  And he leaned over and went, I love you.  He said, I love you guys.  I didn't hear the you guys.  No, he said, I love you guys.  Yes, he was touching me when he said it, but you were there.  Opie filed the harassment suit, and I filed the rejection suit, because I felt left out.  I wanted a hot threesome.  Wow.  Ken likes blondes.  What can you say? 
[03:22:00]  Tussled Opie's hair.  He got all giddy.  He was all giddy.  I guess bosses do all sorts of things when they get giddy.  Did you feel that his tie smacked the back of your head when he leaned over?  How bad is that?  Smelled that awful cologne.  The cologne.  Old spice.  Did he rub his whiskers on your cheek?  His unshaven face brushed against the nape of my neck.  Just a little nuzzle right there on the old neck between the ears and shoulder.  Awful.  All right, Gina.  All right, thanks, guys. 
[03:22:30]  Speaking of Gina, John from Boston makes a good point.  Actually, it's a Chris Rock thing.  Chris Rock said it best.  If you're good looking and you hit on a chick at work, she giggles.  If you aren't, she claims harassment.  Yeah.  Right?  There you go.  Oh, we got to get back to this thing.  Maybe not.  Ed.  Ed.  Where are you calling from?  Hey.  I'm on cell phone.  I can barely hear you guys.  I know.  Where are you calling from?  An iron mill. 
[03:23:00]  What's that?  Where are you?  I'm throwing down $4.95 in a truck.  I just wanted to chime in.  I was listening to you guys talking about those.  In the engine.  I was listening to you guys talking about those gay baby showers.  Yeah.  My wife made me go to Miami.  We had our first kid recently.  They did some of the gayest stuff I've ever seen.  Thank God there was a TV nearby.  Transvestite?  They were playing this stupid game where you put a penny between knees and try to drop 
[03:23:30]  it into a glass.  Oh, that sounds great.  I mean, what is that all about?  You know, and that was the greatest thing.  It was so bad.  My wife told me, don't ever let me have another baby shower.  Let us go out and buy our own stuff.  It was insane.  Ed, are you bowling?  I just want to say, you guys, you guys are all right.  Thank you, Ed.  We were all right before this phone call.  With that? 
[03:24:00]  Thank you, Ed.  Take care.  All right.  Next time you want to call in, put a penny between your teeth and swallow it.  I think we have a clip of Ken in the office that day.  Yeah.  As he was leaning over talking to you.  Opie, you want a b*** job?  Yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep.  Opie just played dead right there on the floor of the office.  Opie, you guys did really well in the ratings. 
[03:24:30]  You did so good.  You can b*** my b*** if you want.  You gave me good ratings.  I want to give you something in return.  Yeah.  I'm going to give you my b***.  You're up in the Arbitron ratings, and that's not the only thing that's up in this office right now.  I'm very excited about the ratings.  I'm just very excited. 
[03:25:00]  But it's not my pleasure I'm concerned with.  Do you want a b*** job?  Ken being a little forward.  What a horrific scene.  This is very happy.  This can't be true.  Let's go to Matt.  Fire Department Matt.  What's up, Matt? 
[03:25:30]  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I got a problem.  See, I'm on a volunteer association.  I've been on it for like about three years, a firefighter.  And I just got done with school, and I've been seeing this girl for three months now.  You guys do a great job, by the way, the volunteer fire departments.  Thanks, man.  It's very hard to get on your show, man.  That's all I got to say.  See, she's on the ambulance squad in Parsippany, and I'm on the Parsippany Fire Department.  And she wants to join my fire department. 
[03:26:00]  And I can't say no to her, and they can't deny her membership because it's a volunteer association.  Right.  Matt, how old are you?  How old are you?  Me, I'm 20.  She's 19.  Okay, here's the deal.  Ready?  Yes.  Break up with her now.  Oh, jeez.  Yep.  Dude, man.  It's only going to get worse.  Yes.  Break up with her now.  Know how many guys out there right now are nodding their heads?  I know, man.  If she wants to join your volunteer fire department, that is a major problem. 
[03:26:30]  What is she going to do in the fire department?  Well, she's already been through the class.  Is she a bruiser?  Dude, is she a big bruiser?  No, dude.  She's this hot little piece of ass.  And she's like, hey, hey, hey.  Sorry, sorry.  He says the F word, but a good thing you used the Hummer word instead of the other thing.  Yeah, dude, you want to really break up with her, and she should email me at Tinkle Drinker.  She sounds hot.  Oh, Norton, I'll give you a little tussle, all right, buddy?  I think you're going to have some major problems, my friend.  I know, man. 
[03:27:00]  Just like I talked to my wife.  I'm like, look, is there any way that you can just, like, lose her application?  Like, nope, you've got to take her.  And, like, I've been through the fire class, and, like, that other guy said that they made  the test to leave me.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I want to, because, call me naive.  Volunteer fire departments are admitting women now, too?  Yeah, they have to, by law.  How long has that been going on over forever?  God, a good, like, five years.  Oh, okay.  Because, you know, these volunteer firehouses is another little thing. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  And the guys could do a little escapism as well.  They get to get away from, you know, their women and their families.  Exactly, man.  And they're doing a great thing, without a doubt.  But there's also that fun factor, and you're hanging with the guys.  The bonding thing.  Oh, definitely, man.  Drinking beer.  You go there, you talk about the women that you tussled the other night, you drink, you  have fun.  Right.  You know?  And it's just like, and the academies are really screwed up, because we had about, like,  five girls in our class when I went to the fire academy.  Right.  And, like, they could not be firemen. 
[03:28:00]  They could not pull me.  I'm, like, 270 pounds, man.  Wow.  They could not pull me out of a fire department.  I'm, like, 6'2".  Like, they could not pull me out of a fire.  It was just impossible.  All right.  And my girlfriend is worse, because she's a skinny, little, scrawny girl who could not,  probably couldn't even pull out a friggin' Doberman or something out of a fire department,  let alone...  You sound a little whipped.  Oh, no.  She doesn't...  You tell your girlfriend, no.  Tell her to put the helmet on and the suspenders and stuff and just look hot.  Hey, if she wants to wear a helmet, give her yours and tell her to wear it in her mouth. 
[03:28:30]  You've got to put your foot down on this one, my friend.  Say no.  All right, man.  Can I give a shootout to my fire department?  No, you're too white for the shootout.  We only...  Oh, man.  We only reserve that for our new homie listeners.  Come on.  Bam, bam, bam.  Come on, man.  You sound too white.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Parsippe.  Hey, uh...  We'll get a couple black guys to call in.  They'll show you how to do the shootouts right.  Captain of the firehouse is going to have her slide down his pole.  Figure that one out.  Yeah, but you're on your way to a fire, and it's a good point, though. 
[03:29:00]  She's sliding down, and halfway down, she gets stuck, and everybody has to take this  What are the other guys going to do until they pry her loose?  Sorry.  I've been sweating.  Jenny, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Oh, my God.  I so agree with you.  Chick today, they don't want equality.  They want to be better than men.  Yeah.  I swear, it's so stupid.  It just pisses me off.  The equality thing's fine.  It's just, you don't have to change.  The women don't have to change everything once they get in.  Yep.  It's like, oh, we want equality. 
[03:29:30]  Well, equality means you want to be doing the things and working in the environment that  men have been working in for years.  So, come in, work in it, and enjoy that working environment.  Don't then come in and go, well, now that we're in, we're going to change it.  I know.  Like, stop.  It's stupid.  I think all the chicks, like, just need to shut up.  I'll tell you what their real problem is.  They can't get laid.  That's their problem.  Yep.  Oh.  Is that it?  Yeah, that's their problem.  I guarantee you.  Do you realize it's against the law if I'm married?  This is absolutely true.  If my wife serves my supper cold, it is against the law for me to punch her in the mouth? 
[03:30:00]  All right.  Well, you don't want to punch her.  Jesus.  Oh, wow, Jenny.  We can't get anything by you.  No, you can't.  I'm not talking about because I'm angry.  I'm talking about that's how she learns.  All right.  All right.  You suck, Jim.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  My best friend's bachelor party.  Party.  We got a Boston listener on the phone. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, close by.  At his bachelor party, his fiancÃ©e's two idiot friends showed up three times during the night  to check up on us.  The friend's fiancÃ©e showed up three times at the bachelor party?  Oh, yeah.  He wasn't even going to be allowed to have one.  We had to beg her to let him have a bachelor party.  Oh, boy.  When the stripper showed up, he had to go outside in the rain and wait until it was over.  Wait, he couldn't be there with the stripper?  No, he couldn't be in the room with the stripper.  Oh, brother.  And he married this broad?  Oh, yeah.  We went out with the next, you know, the next night. 
[03:31:00]  There was actually like two nights before the wedding.  So the next night, we all went out to dinner and we're like, hey, we're going to take Chris  out and take him to the strip club.  She threatened to cancel the wedding if we did.  Man, if I thought she was serious, we would have dragged him there, kicking and screaming.  Oh, yeah.  Well, he's in hell.  You know, the thing was, he threw me my bachelor party and it was like the best night of my  life.  So I wanted to do the same and we just couldn't do anything.  Eric, so the fiancee shows up, right?  What were the guys saying behind your pal's back?  Not even behind his back.  We were like, what the hell is she doing here? 
[03:31:30]  And he goes, oh, well, she wanted to come by and see what was going on.  And then she left and she came back with her two idiot friends and they left.  They were like the fun police.  No fun for you.  Sure.  Why would you even take?  Here's the thing, man.  And knowing that she's that way, you should have just said, ah, we're going to go out  and have some beers or whatever, and then just snuck them off to a whorehouse.  You don't tell the chicks ever.  Yeah.  Well, you know, his brother helped me set it up and we were kind of like, well, it'll  be okay.  You know, we'll have this stripper and everything.  Well, she got wind of that because one of the whip boyfriends told his girlfriend who 
[03:32:00]  told her.  So he actually went outside and waited in like a rainstorm until the stripper was done.  Oh, my God.  What an ass.  He is just an ass.  He stinks.  That's great.  That's sad.  That's great.  All right, Eric.  Good story.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Norton, I'd like to give you a tussle.  I'll tell you, buddy.  He's not gay.  It's just I love you.  Dude, I love you.  And it's not gay.  One man tussling another.  It's just, hey, job well done.  That's right.  Thanks, buddy.  Talk to you later.  You know, because of this tussle phenomenon, I had to tussle people's heads in Buffalo. 
[03:32:30]  I know.  I've been doing it for you.  You were tussling?  Yes.  That's Jim Norton's thing.  You want Jim Norton to tussle your hair?  No.  Go for it.  But don't come up to Ant and I.  That's not our thing.  Why can't I open to Ant?  Because it's not our thing.  I would never tussle.  If someone asked me to tussle, I'd go, get out of here.  Dude, you could be arguably being the king of tussling.  I awkwardly tussled one of these guys' heads in Buffalo and I knew I didn't do it right.  And they knew I didn't do it right.  And I'm like, well, this is Jim's thing.  Well, dude, here's the thing.  When they take their hats off and their hair is sweatily matted to their hair, I want to 
[03:33:00]  tussle them with a hammer.  Stop asking me to tussle your sweaty heads.  Have a nice, clean, poofy, shampooed head and I'll tussle it all day for you.  Well conditioned.  Dude, these lunatics walk up and go, tussle me.  It's just great.  Big grease pit head.  I don't care.  I tussle them.  You know what the worst thing is?  I was signing baseball caps.  Oh, you picked up on this too?  And some smelled like ass.  I'm like, dude, put it in the wash every once in a while or just get a new hat. 
[03:33:30]  Dude, could you sign this?  I grabbed the hat.  I'm like, it's got a ring of crust on the outside that goes around the head.  Did somebody have a miscarriage in your hat set?  It was disgusting.  You can't even hold on to it.  You can't sign it.  The whole hat is greasy where the sharpie doesn't even work on it.  Thank you, Paul.  Paul writes, get off this subject.  I want to hear about Iverson's moms.  Oh, yeah.  We got some great audio clips.  We definitely got to move on.  And we had the Van Halen review. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, that was good.  I was talking about the other day.  We brought it in today.  And then are you ready for a shootout?  Troy from Philly will show you how it's done.  Troy.  Troy.  You, ONA, what up?  You don't sound black.  Yeah.  I'm blackly black.  I think he is, actually.  Well, what's up?  I'll give a shout out to all the homies out there working their butts off.  Hey.  You can't curse during this shootout.  Oh, sorry, brah.  And you said brah.  You're a fake black guy. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, you're fake.  Yeah, plus he said it'll work.  As soon as he said work, you know that's not accurate.  We want a real black guy to do a shootout today.  Hey, Steve from foundrymusic.com and John put together another fine little production piece here.  Another one featuring our old Jimmy Norton.  Huge fan of Ozzy Osbourne, Jimmy.  Yeah, and if Jimmy Norton had a little shift on a music station, it might sound a little something like this.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Network, it's the Jim Norton No Request Show. 
[03:35:00]  That's me, Jim Norton, folks.  Play some Grateful Dead, man.  Jerry Garcia sat on a stool.  He was awful.  Dude, can you play some Winnie Krabbit?  Come on, stop.  Walks around with his dumb shades and he's a hipster and he's sick.  You request it?  Kansas are.  He hates it.  Other bands are boring.  Nirvana.  Shut it, you dope.  Led Zeppelin.  Garbage.  You too.  I hate bandwagon bands like you two that are going to sit there and preach politics.  It's all Ozzy all the time. 
[03:35:30]  He's one of the best live performers on earth.  He's dyslexic.  It doesn't matter.  He's a maniac on stage.  That's the beauty of him.  Remember, if Ozzy didn't sing it.  One word answer.  Awful.  Fuck.  You stink.  My boyfriend's going to kill us both unless you play Limp Bizkit.  So what?  Let him do it.  Oh, brother.  Weekday mornings from 3 to 3.15.  Why?

That means they just walk, they step in, they let you know straight up what's going down.  Hey, dude, dude, dude.  All right.  Dude, hold on a minute.  No doubt.  Why aren't you knocking over the ice cream truck driving by?  All right.  That's easy money right there, son.  Easy peasy.  Come on, come on, let me just finish dropping this word to you right quick.  All right.  All right.  When somebody's going to spaz out and they ain't got nothing to do with your old colleague that used to work with y'all. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  When somebody's going to spaz out, that means they flipping out.  That means they losing it.  That means they about to turn around and just start breaking everything the hell up.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, let me give my shootout.  I just got one shootout.  All right.  Hold on.  We got to get the shootout thing going here.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead, bro.

I'm going to give you a one, all right?  One.  Two.  Old Dirty is the Jackie Robinson of filthy radio.  Might have been nice if I could say radio.  Well, filthy rodeo.  I was going to say radio program and I said filthy rodeo.  Oops.  Oops.  That's good in front of 20 cities.  Ah, the old man.  What's up?  Old man. 
[03:47:00]  Hey.  It's the old man.  Make it fast.  Am I on the air?  Yeah, make it fast.  We got to move on here.  All right.  Real quick.  Not to go back too much with that farm and stuff, man.  Just send the word out to that guy.  Keep his hoe away from that firehouse because that's what he's doing.  He's going to become that hoe.  And he should resign.  If she joins, you lose face by, you know, enabling her along.  I spent 10 years.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Call it ass work.  Dumpy.  Dumpy.  We dumped.  Go.  All right.  Hey, you know, any time you got a woman on board, all the men got up tight.  Everything got real stressed.  And as soon as you lost them, you lost them one or two ways.  Which way did you lose them?  Think about it, guys.  All right.  You lost them in the showers.  Which way did we lose this phone call?  Jesus.  Yes.  You lost this phone call like this.  Dumping. 
[03:48:00]  You lost this phone call.  God.  Oh.  Hello.  It's the old man.  Jesus.  Oh.  It's not worth getting yourself upset about.  It's just one of those little things that happens.  I like when we're in a flow.  I was listening.  I was listening.  And he's talking.  I didn't know what he's talking about.  When did you realize, uh-oh.  Right away.  Pretty much right away.  The old man.  Oh.  The old man.  When the old man calls.  Whenever you have a nickname for yourself, it has man at the end of it.  The whatever man. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  Unless you're a Spider-Man.  Or a Raptor-Man.  There are times in the show, we'll take a call like that.  And there's a point within the conversation that we have with you guys where Ed and I look  at each other and we give the sign.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  This call's gone terribly wrong.  Now we have to figure out something creative to get out of this.  You know something?  The second we realize that's happening, we just push the button now.  We should do that.  I just think we let too many people on our show.  I think you're right.  We're trying to be this people-friendly show.  We like a lot of interaction.  Man, there's all the talk shows in this fine city of ours. 
[03:49:00]  Every caller.  Smooth.  Yeah.  They get to the point.  They know what they're talking about.  Then you hit an O-man.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  What does he want?  He wants to babble.  I think O stands for awful.  Oh, cut it out.  That's not how you spell it.  It'd be obnoxious.  All right.  We got Allen Iverson's mums.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is good.  Allen Iverson is in a bit of trouble. 
[03:49:30]  Just a tad.  Just a tad.  What is he, brandishing a weapon?  He didn't shoot anyone.  Using another Chris Rock line.  We all know how this is going to end.  He'll get off the hook.  Yeah, but it's just leading to other things.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Eventually, he'll shoot a limo driver or something.  You know, he's spending his money like crazy.  Mm-hmm.  He should see the behind the music MC Hammer thing.  Yeah.  Because he's heading that direction. 
[03:50:00]  Uh-huh.  You hear about...  God, I wish I had this story in front of me.  Someone from Philly will help us out.  What?  His mom was stuck somewhere.  Oh, God.  How does the story go?  The mom...  The car that Allen...  The moms, Opie.  The moms.  Allen bought his moms.  His moms.  Yeah.  His mom's a car.  Ooh.  And the car wasn't working right or someone was supposed to pick her up but didn't.  So she just turned around and bought a brand new, like, $65,000 car to drive back to Philly.  To drive back with. 
[03:50:30]  Someone from Philly will help with the...  But that's the basis.  Yeah, he's going to be broke.  Love the story.  You see his big boat?  He's got that huge sailboat.  He was having some kind of a party on that.  Then he had the party in the house.  They're going to jail party that he had with everybody.  And, um, they took him into jail.  AI.  AI didn't do nothing.  So his mom calls him AI.  Well, let's listen, okay? 
[03:51:00]  Artificial intelligence.  Here's Allen Iverson's mom.  Every relationship has ups and downs.  Y'all, one, two, three, four, five rings I see on these men's fingers.  You think y'all don't go through up and down?  Come on.  Get a grip.  Because AI is AI, we got to go through that and we'll go through it.  You know?  God got his back.  Excuse me?  The ups and downs include throwing your wife out.  Don't get out of my face with that crazy stuff.  That's the rumor.  Where you get that from? 
[03:51:30]  That's here, sir.  Because somebody told it to you?  That's not true.  Did you want to tell you that?  Yeah.  Did you want to tell you that?  Don't ask me nothing.  Did you want to tell you that?  I haven't spoken with you.  All right, then.  Don't go there with me.  Oh, my God.  We just found our new midday show.  Wow.  Hire her.  Oh, yeah.  Immediately.  I would listen to that all day long.  Did you want to tell you that?  Good for Allen Iverson's mother, that stupid reporter asking a dumb question.  What?  Does it include throwing your wife out of the house naked?  That's not a reporter getting your snotty little opinion in there.  You're supposed to be unbiased, not asking questions that are forcing your opinion. 
[03:52:00]  She was asking if ups and downs in a marriage that Mrs. Allen Iverson's mother there was commenting on.  She said everyone has the ups and downs.  She asked if throwing your wife out of the house naked is a down.  She know that's not the answer.  How brilliant is that?  She got a great clip out of her.  Let me tell you.  Did Tawana tell you that?  Who's Tawana?  Tawana Brawley. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  Get out my face with that.  Get out my face with that.  Look, I see.  And she goes, she's pointing to all the guys.  She goes, I see a ring on all these man's fingers.  Man's?  All these man's fingers.  What does that mean?  That if they were all married, she goes, you all tell me you don't have your ups and downs?  Oh, okay.  It's different, you know.  I like her.  I had some hell during my marriage, but I don't remember.  You never threw her out naked?  And throwing her out naked or brandishing weapons and threatening people's lives. 
[03:53:00]  But do you understand the snottiness of that reporter question?  Like, to me, they're so biased and they're supposed to be unbiased.  They're going for the soundbite, man.  I know.  She was completely going for the soundbite.  And that's not doing her job.  That's not like a news person.  You're right.  No, no, it was.  But it's not a real news person.  Because you know the answer to that.  They just gather up the, you know, get that soundbite.  Yeah, it's the guy's mother.  Don't antagonize the guy's mother.  She didn't do anything, you dope.  Something tells me she would be antagonized about anything. 
[03:53:30]  You hear her?  I loved her.  She was great.  Let me tell you.  I've got to hear that again.  This relationship has ups and downs.  One, two, three, four, five rings, I see, on these men's fingers.  You think y'all don't go through up and down?  Come on.  Get a grip.  Because AI is AI, we've got to go through that and we'll go through it.  You know?  God got his back.  Throwing your wife out naked.  Excuse me?  Do ups and downs include throwing your wife out naked?  Don't get out of my face with that crazy stuff.  That's the rumor.  Where do you get that from?  That's what I'm saying.  Because somebody told it to you?  That's not true.  Did you want to tell you that? 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  Did you want to tell me?  Don't ask me nothing.  Did you want to tell you that?  I haven't spoken with you.  All right then.  Don't go there with me.  Talk to the head.  Can we play that with the Sanford and Son music playing?  It sounds like, that sounds just like Aunt Esther.  Heavy relationship has ups and downs.  One, two, three, four, five rings, I see, on these men's fingers.  You think y'all don't go through up and down?  Come on.  Get a grip.  Because AI is AI, we've got to go through that and we'll go through it. 
[03:54:30]  Shut up, Demi.  God got his back.  Shut up, Demi.  Don't get out of my face with that crazy stuff.  Shut up, Demi.  That's what's wrong with it.  Where do you get that from?  Because somebody told it to you?  Did you want to tell you that?  Shut up, Demi.  Don't ask me nothing.  Did you want to tell you that?  Shut up, Demi.  All right, Jim.  Don't go here with me.  Shut up, Demi.  Stay out of the bushes.  It's on Esther. 
[03:55:00]  Y'all heathens.  Okay, here's the real story.  Why don't you put your face in cookie batter and make gorilla cookies?  Kevin, what's going on?  Kevin.  The real story is on Instagram.  I think I got on the instant feedback, too.  Mike from Brooklyn.  His mom had just come home from the airport, and his boys were supposed to pick her up,  so she went down to the nearest dealership and bought a $65,000 SUV to drive home. 
[03:55:30]  Hey, man, he's got a lot of money, but you know what?  There was a time MC Hammer thought he had a lot of money.  Jersey Bob is very funny.  He's a smart-ass bastard.  He goes, Anthony never threw his wife out naked.  He threw a naked woman at his wife.  You bastards.  Very funny. 
[03:56:00]  Jersey Bob.  That was a menage of a tray?  Tres?  Trees?  Tres?  What did you say?  Tres.  I mean, a menage of a tray.  Tres.  A menage of a trough.  What is that?  Let's start with that.  That's crazy.  All that talk is crazy.  Get out of my face with that.  That's crazy.  AI is AI, and that's why I'm going to do this.  AI is AI.

[04:15:30]  have a good time with your buddies and this is the kind of uh bitch that would be there  turning you in hey luann i don't like the way before i got before my husband and i got married  he went to the strip bar with his buddies i had no problem with it oh you know what i go to the  strip bar with my husband yeah really because you won't let him go alone because you won't let him  go alone whatever he wants yeah but for the most part we don't want you coming to the strip club with  us because we have a cool relationship for the most part well no why because he has like a 
[04:16:00]  threesome fantasy in his head that he's uh exploring and he could somehow get another box back to the house  and and you'll be involved with it okay blocking how do i how do i try to make a threesome work in  my marriage i know i'll invite luann to the strip club with me and see if she uh remotely gets turned  on by women yeah since i can't install air conditioning and do brilliant impressions  well you know what my husband all he has to do is ask for a threesome and i give it to him  really really have to to convince me to go to strip bars to get me you're a pig yeah you're a pig 
[04:16:30]  you're out you're out having extramarital sex i don't do that i'm not married jeez i'm a single  guy extramarital sex my husband's there he's participating doesn't matter it's still extramarital  if it's outside marriage it's did you hear him he's not put that put that pee whipped guy on the  phone he is whipped if you do the oil he wants to talk to you let's all laugh at him yeah yes sir  oh what's your name what's your name bro my name is tony tony you do the laundry and she does the oil 
[04:17:00]  she said hey whatever it takes man dude why are you doing the laundry seriously i don't do the  laundry all the time no guy wants to do laundry dude she's got you whipped man from her talking  and us listening we're like what kind of guy could put up with this that your woman's like a bitch  no she's just a very confident woman that's not confident confident women don't need to come off  as confident women they just do it naturally they don't need to call up and go oh i'm not a pig here 
[04:17:30]  she's not she was she's offended by certain language and stuff that's not confident dude  offended by language she just wanted to rip on on norton because he's always ripping on women she  wanted to give a shot i happen to be very nice to women and i've never made a woman do anything  she didn't want to do dude men don't do laundry unless they're chinks  tony good one admit it tony that was a good one you like that was good but last no man she  hey tony why do you invite uh your your wife to the strip club yeah why why did i invite her yeah 
[04:18:00]  well first of all we were in new orleans at the mardi gras figure what what better thing to do no tom  why did you invite her to the uh the strip club uh tom uh wrong name try again norton i know wow we  didn't get anything past you either well you guys are just a couple of pistols tony you italian guy  am i an italian guy uh no oh i thought with the name tony that's why he hasn't smacked her in the  face yet were you hoping that luann would get turned on by some of the strippers or what  uh well did she get turned on by the strippers were you hoping that she would comment were you hoping 
[04:18:30]  that she would why not was i hoping that she would no i just figured what the hell we're there we  might as well she broke tony like a horse you ever see the horses the the stallions that run within  the hills and and then they bring them back to the corral and they're saying no you're not gonna  ride me i'm my own horse i'm independent and then after a while they're just burning dee dee dee dee dee  walking with the saddle on their back you gave up you're walking with a saddle on your back and dude 
[04:19:00]  she called up looking to be confrontational and i was nice to her right she started being cranky  because i didn't give her what she wanted and she's not used to that obviously from living with  someone who's p-whipped she's used to getting what she wants tony i'm not knocking you dude if  you're getting some box good for you tony it's obvious that you don't play golf huh i i play golf  yes i do yeah all right tony do you really want luann there with you when you're playing golf with  your buddies as a matter of fact she's one hell of a golfer too exactly she changes the oil and she's  a golfer tony you're a front she likes box she's going to strip clubs she's gay tony

[04:20:00]  that's really quick hillbilly name yeah i'm a loser can you argue like a man do you have to argue like  a broad jesus you are a weak dope why do you have to you're a loser you put the hell up by your fat  head how is norton a loser yeah i never called your job stupid how is he a loser yeah how am i  a loser look at his life and what he's doing and what he's done with himself how is that yeah and he 
[04:20:30]  has to pay for sex he's a loser i love paying for sex because i have the money i can just give it to  some hole and she goes and she gets out how great is that i've seen plenty of girls paraded around this  studio that he hasn't paid no but i don't mind paying for sex i understand a man like there's another  reason why guys pay for uh sex is it's a turn on to them yep it's not that it's not because they're  uh desperate or can't get women on their own you know some guys are really turned on to the the fact  they they pay a woman for sex and it just cost tony more he had to buy a ring and years of 
[04:21:00]  aggravation to get it yeah all i gotta do is you think so huh i certainly do come on you got to come  back harder than that you're on the radio you got to come back harder than that come on you call you  know what i take good care of my man in and out of bed really when he's doing the laundry or when  you're doing the oil when he's doing the laundry and when i'm changing the oil on his car you're a  sassy gal the type of gal that can do anything a man does shut up that's right and you like to go  to strip clubs yeah and do work on the car yeah really and who's your favorite baseball team 
[04:21:30]  the cleveland indians you're a dyke the fact is if you know what jim tome's batting average is  you're a dyke well i don't know what his batting average is but exactly hey look i have a deck that  needs work could you come over and work on it me and him will go out dress shopping and you can work  on the deck you've broken your man you really have you broke him well how about if i just come over  and pour a little concrete and toss you in it wow do you realize you have the wit of an autistic  excuse me you have and you're deaf it's probably all that riveting you dyke it's probably all that work 
[04:22:00]  in the pit in the mechanic you stink marion's at home going that that comeback fucked you are the  worst she calls up trying to be witty and sharp and you call me a loser and i could pour concrete  and throw you in it you're a dope you know what norton get some clorox i don't care exactly give  up bye-bye typical you called up you couldn't take it and you hung up your baby don't try to be sexy 
[04:22:30]  off the phone i'm gonna go give tony some no you're not tony's doing whatever i ask you assign  him to do i think she got you there yeah she's what's up she's really a pistol that one hey  uh yo norton yes sir how can you defend the lady who lives off the system her entire life and gets  rich overnight from a pumped son with some basketball skills is that what happened that really really  bothers me i'll tell you why i'm defending i'm not defending i don't care what she's like as a  person dude i didn't make this magnanimous statement i am making a judgment on what i heard from 
[04:23:00]  that reporter that's what i'm only in that little sound clip i never heard alan iverson's mother talk  i don't care what she's like that's not pertinent to the story it was a fair question by the reporter  and then i have uh had to deal with stupid reporters and stuff it was a fair question because she was  talking about every marriage having up and downs well and she pointed out something that was a  little uh a little uh you know a little out a little more out there than you know an up and  down in a marriage yeah that was the buzz going around philadelphia anyway that question the mother  was smoothing it over a little too much but exactly do what you just said there's a buzz 
[04:23:30]  going around philly that's why she did it it wasn't real journalism bringing out it was tabloid  type journalism and that's what annoyed it was the snottyness of the question not the fact that  she confronted her right but i'm going to say something that's going to offend a lot of your  listeners it's not bad but she's just a stereotypical porch monkey and ai is an ungrateful a-hole  for the privileged wife come on i mean look it's the guy's mother overcome  the guy's a great player he's a millionaire and his mom is what i don't i don't understand 
[04:24:00]  and and the re come on can't we just live together she obviously racism she raised a son that could  do something because he's a millionaire my mother i mean you know my mom's a nice lady but she  certainly didn't raise a millionaire she raised a sex addict who has to pay for it and talk to hicks  luann hey i'm luann hey i like you know what i like melissa uh go ahead melissa  hi elena yeah hey what's up good say what you have to say because i kind of i kind of like what 
[04:24:30]  you have to say i'm calling about this whole men doing the laundry thing right my man does the  laundry right why i'm busy i'm busy making the money oh i can bring home the bacon right up in a pan  that's cool i'm not saying it's wrong for a guy to do laundry i was just i was just that  aggravating c that called up and she really she's the type of chick that like will actually say  something to her husband and then all of a sudden he laughs to shut her up and she was aggravating  oh she was she's probably has a big bunt and three kids and she's a toilet scrubber melissa 
[04:25:00]  how much how much more money do you make than your husband i make twice what he makes jesus i don't  know i wouldn't be able to come home at night what does he do why not i'd feel so insecure and  that doesn't really count if he's pimping you i'd have a tough time if uh if my girl was making  a lot more money than me definitely really what is what is i once worked for a radio station and  matter of fact it was the girl that had the lady that had the internal investigation to get us right 
[04:25:30]  back on the air yeah she made a s load of money and her husband was like kind of like a painter guy  or something and and he would come to these radio station functions and i always looked at him  like dude what's up yes my husband's not a painter guy he makes good money i just think better yeah no  this was uh i mean she had a real career and the other guy was just kind of struggling but was this  uh lady's husband and it was the weirdest thing to see them together because uh because she made so  much money she just had i don't know so much more uh power yeah it was it was strange to look at 
[04:26:00]  but i'll bet you dude i'll bet you that he no no hold on i'll bet you that he would spank her  and pull her hair because she was obviously dominant and i'm guaranteeing you and in bed  yeah spanking her like you know that fat dummy that just called in the one who likes to you know  do guy things huh yeah yeah no i don't do guy things no no not you not you not you uh dana defensive  i'm talking i'm talking about the the cleveland indian fan right and she likes a bad baseball team  that really annoys me where's bartolo cologne stupid dyke behind her trailer all right melissa

[04:27:00]  really age he's uh he still looks kabo wabo uh goddamn tequila and it's it's pickled him you know  that sammy hagar is well into his 50s yeah and he looks like he's maybe maybe early 40s he's older  than david lee roth guy's still rocking the guy's still partying his voice is is still strong as ever  yeah uh you can't say the same thing for david lee roth no unfortunately because a lot of us grew  up listening to van halen we'd love to see the the van halen of old but that's you know gone never to 
[04:27:30]  return again so here's some of the things said in the review sammy hagar's and david lee roth's  individual 90 minute shows offered a fascinating study in contrast and in the case of roth a freaky  demonstration of abnormal psychology on the first of two nights at the amphitheater hagar kicked things  off with his band the wabaritas we we saw the wabaritas perform yes we did his set promised a  margarita drenched tna written good time for all as long as your notion of a good time includes getting 
[04:28:00]  soused checking out bikini clad babes and screaming out i can't drive 55 aside from the last thing it  sounded like buffalo i think right uh think jimmy buffett with more electric guitar and attitude  hagar who's been a solid front man since the early 70s is a total pro and was an excellent voice  as he and his band whipped through a mix of solo material and van hagar gems it should also be pointed  out that uh michael anthony yeah uh helped uh sammy with his set he was on base for for his uh set 
[04:28:30]  roth's show was frankly one of the best quotes ever one of the most bizarre spectacles this reviewer  has ever witnessed let me see the picture i i gotta i gotta get a good look at it  picture look at david lee roth roth's show was frankly one of the most bizarre spectacles this  reviewer has ever witnessed anthony he goes on and says first there was unavoidably the look  yeah imagine if you dare a mutation of carol channing iggy pop and don knots all dressed up in 
[04:29:00]  bare chested blue spandex with an insane uh cheshire cat grin the showman was impressively fit but  incredibly frightening as he fronted his van halen tribute band through a set of bands early songs  of the band's early songs the tunes were a mix of radiant hard rock and borscht belt  bellicosity what does that mean bellicosity bellicosity i think i'm saying it right do you know 
[04:29:30]  what i mean i've never seen that word in my life bellicosity they always got to throw a couple of  words in there that's right we are reading from rolling stone yeah they're brilliant uh they do  this all the time we anthony and i we used to do this bit where we would um read reviews of albums  and you had no clue you would try to figure out what they were saying in the review with all the big  words and okay uh and roth's voice so weak in recent years was marginally better especially on such  old fave raves as and the cradle will rock and running with the devil but the final effect of 
[04:30:00]  seeing him all tarted up trying to relive past glories is more camp than cool in the end the true  tribute should go to tour the tour organizer organizer who made big money out of almost nothing by pairing  these two guys somebody said should send him to the middle east quick  yeah yeah hagar comes out um looking a little better in this review than than david lee roth david lee  roth has become a cartoon character he really is he's not uh back in the olden days there when he was 
[04:30:30]  with van halen he was pretty much the coolest rock guy ever it's funny to think that now looking at him  but when he would hit the stage with van halen oh it was cool as hell he'd have his bottle of jack  he's doing the karate moves he's jumping he's spinning he's kicking he was like a california  surfer dude the the women were begging to get backstage where he had that whole system  that he worked out with his boys what was that uh he would kind of what was it he was he would  point at uh girls and stuff and then the roadies would come and get him yeah they'd come and get 
[04:31:00]  him he'd have like a smorgasbord of girls he had some kind of signal that he would do on stage and  that would that would uh mean that uh the roadies had to go you know should go get those girls for  the look at his picture backstage dude that's him i know it doesn't even look like him  looks like robin williams he does robin williams with longer blonder hair he looks like edgar winter  with a bad blonde comb over uh awful what yeah he's on the back  oh robin williams oh so funny yeah did you see the special no i haven't seen it i heard it was good 
[04:31:30]  stop it i honestly did i watched it it was getting uh good reviews in the papers because  people get hypnotized when this guy talks they get hypnotized if you took two seconds to say  what is robin really saying here and is it funny you'd say no he could jump around and point at  something behind him and go oh look i'm on the moon and people they will roll with laughter like it is the 
[04:32:00]  funniest goddamn thing he ever said and if it was anyone else if boss was saying this stuff  he'd get tomatoes thrown at him i'll be honest i did not see the special i've seen him working out  a couple times uh at the comedy cellar i don't know yeah what the special was the material i saw  i don't expect i don't expect you to say a bad word about robin williams what if what if what am i 
[04:32:30]  giving you a sword no he's right he's right he's but i know it i know what you really mean he was at  the comedy cell last night with seinfeld neither one of them went on they were hanging out just  hanging out hanging out upstairs i was sam starstruck i do not find him funny at all i'm not  gonna i'm not knocking dude i'm not saying i honestly didn't see the special but the material i  saw and i wanted to hate him i swear to god i've already got a picture with him i wanted to dislike  him and go this guy stinks watching him i was annoyed because i really enjoyed watching him i'm not  being polite i really wanted to dislike him and he's not even in new york anymore he left town 
[04:33:00]  today i i cannot take he went on some political thing about the uh middle east and osama bin  laden and it was like he you gotta and the people are rolling and he's just saying like oh  and osama bin laden's in a cave and we ought to you know oh get in there and people are like oh my god  he said nothing he said nothing nothing i'll have to see it a lot of people saying it was a  really good show no it wasn't it's i'm telling you that's what the phones are saying oh they're  lying honestly everyone i've talked to has said it was good even here's emo from uh stat down f you 
[04:33:30]  it was hilarious you guys get hypnotized by this guy he's done this for years he's done this for  years peter what's up guys a bit funny he's not he really sucked all he did was keep saying the f  word and that was it he just said the f word too much trying to be funny he talked about stuff he  didn't even know he's talking about that's what he even he even tried to talk about jesus and said  jesus didn't have a brother he did rattling on not making any sense at all and every time he'd say 
[04:34:00]  the f word they'd laugh wait dude he said jesus did have a brother or didn't did not yeah he did  um exactly it was a special on hbo and he's talking about stuff he didn't know what he was talking  about and basically it was him trying to act young and do a concert saying the f word over and over  he was using the f word a lot i can only go by what i saw him working out and i was i understand  don't worry you're safe you're safe jimmy with him i know i'm a worm but i'm really not being one right  now i'm being honest don't worry uh uh jimmy hasn't said anything bad about robin i know and i 
[04:34:30]  wouldn't it's okay ken what's up i mean it ken you're gonna tell me that you didn't think that last bit  that he did was the funniest thing you ever saw what last bit the last bit when he was  had his face in the crook of his arm imitating a woman no i no i i i don't get i don't get it  he's not funny anything he's saying isn't funny i didn't what what sir norton check it out and come  back and report on it and tell me if that was not the funniest thing you ever saw and dude i i actually 
[04:35:00]  you i would i would say something bad about him if i didn't like him because he's on he's a movie star  man he's not gonna come back and hurt a comic on my level he doesn't care you understand what i  mean it's not like really you don't want to take that chance i wouldn't anyway though all right one  more one more mark what's up dude what's up oh oh anthony is delusional are you crazy that show  like the last call i said that last bit was hilarious dude i was rolling and i only saw like  bits and pieces of it my whole family were watching it i mean yeah your whole family's watching you're  all laughing at nothing dude i know what you're saying that it is sometimes you do get addicted by 
[04:35:30]  what he's saying but some of the stuff come on that last bit was was i was unbelievable i mean i  i'd be the first to say i thought it was gonna suck but i was i was uh amused by it i couldn't  believe it dude all right no me and colin were talking about it after he came in and we were like  jesus he was really funny watching him from downstairs to the cellar and this i mean if colin had trashed  him i wouldn't say it on the air but he was like to say i know i wouldn't know why we don't know 
[04:36:00]  when to believe you because i'm being i'm telling you i don't know why would i brought  if you hated robin williams you certainly wouldn't be on this show if i didn't think he was funny i  would probably be diplomatic about it but i would say i didn't think he was funny but dude i'm  honestly telling you and i've told you this off the air even i've said this off the air he has said  that he likes what i know he came in and worked out off the air and that he was really funny and we  enjoyed it let me tell you something you're you're somehow i'm not i'm not saying you're you're  brainwashed or hypnotized you are somehow influenced by what it takes to achieve a level 
[04:36:30]  of there's something going on that you're a comic and and you you you work your ass off and you're  you're looking at him in a different way than than i am it's actually just the opposite we are actually  much harder on other comics that have achieved that level like how could these monkeys laugh at  that it stinks believe me i could care less that i don't know i feel like the guy that pulled the  curtain away and i'm seeing the the little guy working the levers for the levers for the wizard  thing because he he i i years ago i looked and said oh my god this man is not funny and there's my 
[04:37:00]  mom you know just laughing her ass off oh he's a genius and then everyone the stream of consciousness  oh stop it the guy is saying nothing he is not saying funny jokes there is no like set up punch  line thing the stories aren't funny he's stating the obvious and doing funny faces and dances while 
[04:37:30]  he does it and people just think it's so goddamn funny oh my child came up to me the other day and  went and the place is rolling that he's doing a baby voice and moving his arms weird and there is  nothing funny about what he's saying i i know what you're saying and i'm believe me i'm not  duped by a comic like as far i i see the smoke and mirrors but i watched him for the material  and i really enjoyed him and i was surprised i enjoyed him as much as i did and this is me and  kyle talk i know this is again stuff i've said off the air yeah i really enjoyed watching him and i 
[04:38:00]  didn't want to enjoy it because i again like an audience member i don't want to enjoy robin williams  because everyone likes robin williams it's kind of right yeah i like robin too but i really did enjoy  all right all right you understand what i mean i've never seen i pull some clips off of that  goddamn thing for tomorrow and i will say the parts and and i'll be honest pull the parts where  the audience is laughing the most after he gets done with it and let's see what he was saying okay  i'll be honest we'll do that tomorrow all right all right and when we get back we'll play what do we  learn there is a word being among us there is no corresponding meaning but it seems to mean
