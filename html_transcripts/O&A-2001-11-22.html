<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a self-deprecating introduction, labeling the show as "disgusting," "awful," "filth and trash," but also "really good."  The hosts immediately launched into a critique of Michael Jackson's 30th-anniversary special, focusing heavily on Whitney Houston's appearance ("skin and bones") and expressing concerns about Jackson's interactions with children, referencing Linda Stassi's negative review.  This segment was rife with sexually explicit and vulgar language, interspersing descriptions of sexual acts with commentary on Jackson's appearance and behavior.

A phone interview with actor Dennis Quaid followed. The hosts began by mocking Quaid using Mickey Rooney impressions from *Bill*, before shifting to a discussion of Quaid's career, encompassing roles in *Jaws 3D* and *Great Balls of Fire*, and his band, "The Sharks."  The conversation touched upon Quaid's experiences at Hogs and Heifers, his divorce, and a recent visit to Ground Zero.  Quaid's guitarist, Jamie James, briefly participated.

Opie then recounted a graphic and vulgar tale of staying in a "crack hotel" after a late-night contract signing.  He detailed the deplorable conditions, including broken air conditioning, stained sheets, and a large mirror, employing highly explicit language to describe the hotel's state and implied history of illicit activities.  The hosts engaged in sexually explicit speculation about past occupants and the condition of the bedding. A caller then challenged the hosts' previous denials of showering with other men. The show continued with discussions of high school gym class, featuring a sexually suggestive anecdote about rope climbing and gym teachers, before a caller shared a story about unintentionally paying for his friend's Caribbean cruise.  The segment concluded with more vulgar and sexually explicit banter.

A substantial portion of the show featured listener calls describing violent and humiliating experiences in school gym class.  These included gym teachers using half-deflated basketballs, forcing shirtless students onto wrestling mats, and even one instance of a teacher hitting a student with a lead pipe. Callers also recounted playground games like "asses up" handball.  The discussion then veered into a highly offensive rant about the lack of diversity on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?", employing extreme racial and homophobic slurs.  The segment then shifted to the recent plane crash near New York City, with the hosts offering speculation interspersed with unrelated anecdotes and increasingly offensive and sexually explicit jokes, culminating in an extended, highly offensive tirade against Dan Rather.  No in-studio guests were present during this segment, but numerous callers participated. The segment ended abruptly.

A beer tasting segment featured Steel Reserve High Gravity lager, described as urine-colored and unpalatable, followed by a Howling Monkey black and tan.  Reverend Allen was a guest during this segment, participating in the discussion of the beers and their appeal to impoverished communities, followed by a rambling discussion of the *Planet of the Apes* franchise.

The bulk of the remaining show focused on Don West's dismissal from the Home Shopping Network.  The hosts replayed audio clips of West's sales pitches, including the infamous "22-year-old virgins" incident, and proceeded to mimic his style, creating vulgar and sexually suggestive scenarios involving various products.  The final part addressed "Stalker Patty," a listener who had previously caused issues at a show taping.  The hosts read her lengthy apology letter, detailing her housing problems and explaining her actions.  The hosts and guests joked about Patty, using offensive language and descriptions of her appearance.  Listener calls followed, offering opinions on Patty, and the show concluded with further discussion of Don West and a final *Star Trek* reference.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious amusements and outright horror.  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  Filth and trash.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Truly tasteless and not funny. 
[00:00:30]  Are we going to tape the Michael Jackson special tonight?  Oh, my God.  What's special now?  I don't even know about a Michael Jackson special.  Anthony, it's Michael Jackson's 30th anniversary special.  Is this the one that was, even though he's been in the business 32 years, hold the phone.  Is this the one that was taped when he was here live?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So we get to see the crap.  It is going to be a complete freak show because you've got Whitney Houston.  That's just skin and bones.  She's singing a song.  Uh, Linda Stassi from The Post. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  She reviews the special that's on tonight.  It sounds like it's going to be hilarious.  An atrocity that people sitting there praising this criminal.  I guess there's a few montages with Michael Jackson with kids and stuff.  Yeah, with the children.  And Linda Stassi writes, please, please, please stop allowing this man to show himself with children.  It makes me want to scream and throw up.  People don't understand I'm a child at heart.  That's what it is.  I missed my childhood because my overbearing father never let me be a child. 
[00:01:30]  So now I have to touch children.  And then it says, at any rate, the show opens with a number by Whitney Houston.  Her gorgeousness will never die, but it's being literally eaten away by the fact that she is skin and bones.  She makes Calista Flockhart look fat.  Nice.  Heartbreaking.  I love it.  Her drug addicted Bobby Brown probably smacking her like Ike smacked Tina.  Can only hope.  Yeah.  This is a great tribute. 
[00:02:00]  Let me put on one of my songs.  I'm going to make a change.  Oh, you're cute.  Come here.  Oh, you're hot.  I like the sound of your voice.  I'm going to make it right.  I'm looking at the petrified in the mirror.  As I turn up the clock.  You're a kid, Fatchett.  That's right.  Oh, it's all good.  You're a kid in the street. 
[00:02:30]  You've got enough to eat.  Who am I to be blind, pretending to be there in the heat?  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the eggs, though.  I've got a broken bottle of time.  It looks like a morass.  It's in the hole.  They follow each other on the window.  It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  I don't know where to go.  I don't want to watch it.  I don't know.  I'm starting with the man in the mirror. 
[00:03:00]  What was the man in the mirror?  If used properly, late-sex condoms are effective against pregnancy, age, and other stutzes.  Stutzes.  Look what I did to you again.  Virgil.  Doggy.  The filthy fantastic. 
[00:03:30]  Hot car.  Missionary position.  Piledriver.  Virgin.  I hope we're not wasting our time with this little ticket.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Get on your hands and knees like a dog. 
[00:04:00]  That's it.  Roll around like a dog.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  Woo!  Okay.  Come in.  Come in.  Come in.  Come in.  Come in. 
[00:04:30]  Virgin.  Virgin.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Get a man and a clever.  If you want to make the world a better place, you can take a look at yourself and make that.  Yeah, baby.  Hey, man.  Stay beautiful.  Use it or lose it.  Red rocket.  Red rocket.  Red rocket.  Red rocket.  Red rocket.  Huh?  I'm trying to hold my legs to a man and a clever.  Wonderful.  Hey. 
[00:05:00]  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  Horrific.  Oh.  I'm starting with...  I was kicking in the nuts.  That's right, Carmen.  I'm starting with the man in the mirror.  Is there a man over my shoulder?  Because I can't see a man in the mirror when only I'm looking.  Oh, God.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Linda Stassi goes on to say about this special that's on tonight on CBS.  On CBS.  It's a special.  The cameras keep shooting back to Jackson sitting in the audience with a chalk white face. 
[00:05:30]  That's me.  And bright red lipstick next to his pals Elizabeth Taylor and Macaulay Culkin.  When Jackson reunites with his brothers and they do the old Jackson 5 numbers, the show is perfection.  But you can't help but notice that it looks like this family of black people who somehow ended up with a brother who's become a kabuki.  Kabuki.  He does look like kabuki, doesn't he?  Oh, kabuki.  It reminded me of Steve Martin in The Jerk.  The brothers look so handsome and healthy. 
[00:06:00]  And by contrast, Michael looks even weirder.  And he's not in good voice when singing with the family.  It's vitiligo.  I got the disease that turns you white.  They're all pink on the inside.  That's right.  Well.  I got Neverland.  So it looks like it's going to be a fun freak show tonight.  I have a...  It's like an amusement park at my house for children.  And the parents just keep shoveling the children into the auger.  Oh, it's all gooey.  That's right.  It sure is, butters. 
[00:06:30]  Come here.  Get some Michael Jackson ice cream.  It comes in a pump dispenser.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  Why don't we get rid of all those pesky clothes?  I don't want to get the throcks, fellas.  Woo!  Woo!  I like what's that look like cleanestness. 
[00:07:00]  They have to be little and hairless.  No!  No!  You ever seen a grown man naked? 
[00:07:30]  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  I feel your fever, my little round.  I'll pick you up in my car and go break the sun.  Those men want to have sex with me.  You ever seen a real wife?  That you're the one for me.  The way you make me feel. 
[00:08:00]  I'll make me feel.  I'll make me feel.  I'll make me feel.  I'll make me feel.  I'll make me feel.  I'll make me feel.  I'll make me feel.  I'll make me feel.  Oh, my Lord.  Same with you.  Pain is it.  Pain is it.  Pain is it.  Oh, show me, baby.  What?  Pain is it.  Yeah! 
[00:08:30]  Ah!  A-A-A-A!  A-A-A!  A-A-A!  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Do you like having a background?  Penises.  Virgin. 
[00:09:00]  Penises.  No.  Go, girl.  But.  No.  Go, girl.  You're a kid-toucher.  Me, crap. Me, crap.  This is legal, isn't it?  No.  This is legal, isn't it? 
[00:09:30]  No.  Wish somebody put this retard out of his misery.  This stupid voice.  Freaking fag, you want to make out or something?  No.  Freaking fag, you want to make out or something?  No.  Howdy.  Dang it.  No.  What are you, gay?  No.  What are you, gay? 
[00:10:00]  No.  You won't have me, don't.  No. ênis.  Penises.  No.  Penises.  There we go.  God, that was fun.  Yeah!  Poor Garvin.  Woo! 
[00:10:30]  Gokey!  Garvin was getting nailed by Michael Jackson.  Well.  Yeah!  I don't know.  We hack ourselves.  No!  We found that very funny.  That's my new favorite clip.  Next Monday on the Opie and Anthony Show,  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:11:00]  And we're back with the O&A Show.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Very busy day today, Ann.  Hell yeah.  Look at who we got on the phone right now.  We have Dennis Quaid.  Dennis Quaid's on the phone.  Now, what is he, doing a gig tonight with his band?  I guess he's got a band, so he's going to be performing with the band.  Every actor has a band.  Every actor has a band now.  It's like the hip thing to do.  Just don't say it's 30-odd foot of grunts.  You know what?  You've got to start this interview talking like Mickey Rooney from the movie Bill. 
[00:11:30]  He was in, Dennis Quaid was in one of my favorite movies of all time.  Bill, with Mickey Rooney as the retarded older gentleman,  and Dennis Quaid was Gary, or Barry Morrow.  Right.  Yeah.  All right, let's talk to Dennis Quaid.  Is this Barry Moore?  Hello.  Barry Morrow.  Hi, buddy. 
[00:12:00]  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  Okay, get a hold of yourself now.  I got good hair and good teeth.  I'm not a crack-minded old man.  Okay, Mickey.  Get a hold of yourself.  I'm looking for Barry Morrow, 9-3-5-6-8-2-25-18-3-9.  Yeah.  Well, you're good.  You got to part.  You got to do the chicken.  You got to do the chicken.  Oh, boy.  Chicken.  Oh, I love chicken.  Now, Bill, remember your ulcer. 
[00:12:30]  No, I'm fine.  I love chicken.  I love chicken.  And then Dennis has to go chase him into the corner of the kitchen.  Dennis, one of my favorite movies of all time is Bill with you and Mickey Rooney.  Yeah.  It was a movie.  I mean, you were just early into your career.  Yeah.  And I...  I had an experience working with Mickey, too.  With Mickey Rooney.  How was that?  He was a legend.  Oh, I got stories.  I bet. 
[00:13:00]  You haven't got a long enough radio show.  Oh, yeah, we do.  So, I got to tell you, I had a girlfriend punch me in the face because of that movie.  It was a TV movie.  It had just come out.  And I'm over her house.  We're sitting watching it.  And she's crying.  She's crying at Mickey's performance.  And I start laughing my ass off.  She hits me.  She called me an insensitive prick and punched me in the face.  Yeah.  Well, you got to admit, that was some funny stuff, though.  When he's running around, I'm looking for my sister. 
[00:13:30]  She lived on Florida Street.  And she chases the old lady.  No.  No.  It's not me.  I'm not your sister.  Please, hey, buddy.  Come on.  Classic.  Dennis, you got to admit, no one else has ever brought up Bill to you.  No.  No.  I got to tell you, I'm really impressed.  Usually they talk about Jaws 3D, great balls of fire, inner space, traffic, any given Sunday.  Come on.  Hey, by the way, thanks for helping wreck the Jaws series.  We greatly appreciate that.  Thanks.  Thank you so much. 
[00:14:00]  Jaws 1, unbelievable.  Jaws 2, okay.  Jaws 3.  It was 3D, though, which was kind of cool.  My nine-year-old favorite movie.  Is it?  Yeah.  And Frequency was great.  I love Frequency.  I got to tell you, that was a really good movie.  Yeah, it was a good movie.  Didn't do much in the film, right?  We used the Great Jones Firehouse down near the Bowery, and those guys lost 10 guys the  other day.  Yeah.  A lot of the guys we were working with.  So now you got a band? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, we're called the Sharks.  The Sharks.  Yeah.  And what kind of music do you do?  We play rock and roll, blues, country, a little jazz.  You're at a house?  A little everything.  Do you sing, Dennis?  You'll make up your mind about that, I guess, won't you?  Well, now, you sang in Great Balls of Fire.  Yes, I did.  Yeah.  So you've got a voice.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah.  I've written some songs for some films and things like that.  I've been doing this since I was 12.  Yeah.  Dennis, if you're hanging out at Hogs and Heifers tonight, I'm looking forward to the  drunken pictures of you in the paper tomorrow. 
[00:15:00]  My God, they nail you every time.  I don't know why you go down there.  They nail you in the post the next day every time.  No, not every time.  You don't know about the other time.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, maybe.  Well, you got that right.  It's only the pictures I've seen, but it's so funny.  You open up, and there's Dennis.  His eyes are going, I don't know which way.  He's on top of the bar.  He's dancing.  There's a nude girl next to him.  Fabulous, the life of me.  What was I going to do?  Be a spoiled sport?  Hell no, man.  Party. 
[00:15:30]  Coming out, party.  Anyway, it's a raucous place.  Yeah.  It'll be a good time for anybody who comes down.  We'll guarantee you that.  Who else has gone down there, Ben, and gotten into trouble?  Harrison Ford.  Do you see him down there?  Harrison Ford?  No.  I think he likes it.  No, we were on different shifts.  Last time I saw Harrison Ford's picture as he left Hogs and Heifers, it was in the backseat  of a car, two girls just on top of him, and he was in the paper again a couple of days  later announcing his divorce.  So, I don't know. 
[00:16:00]  Hogs and Heifers is like, that's a party place.  Well, I announced my divorce before I went down there.  Yeah, well, that's good.  Well, not good, I'm sure.  But what it's worth.  Yeah, you guys were together for a while, and that was kind of a surprise.  Do you punch Russell Crowe in the face the next time you see him?  You want to punch Russell in the face?  No comment.  No comment.  Yeah, that son of a bitch.  Can he leave some girls for other people, for God's sake?  The guy's riding high and everything, I understand, but Jesus Christ.  How about backing off for a second?  Do you want me to go back to Bill, Dennis? 
[00:16:30]  You were doing well there for a while.  Oh, boy, I hate Russell Crowe, too, Barry.  Oh, man.  What a blast.  Tickets available at the door tonight for $20.  You're also shooting a movie in the city?  Yeah, I'm doing a movie with Todd Haynes and Julianne Moore called Far From Heaven.  And I think we're the only film actually shooting in New York right now.  Yeah, they're bringing it back.  Nice.  They just started that up again because they canceled all the shoots for a while. 
[00:17:00]  Have you been down to Ground Zero?  Yeah, I went down there.  In fact, I was down there today.  Yeah, what do you think?  Really something else.  Isn't it?  Everyone says that TV just doesn't do it justice.  Well, yeah, it's a lot bigger.  And, of course, the smell of it is not on television.  Yeah.  And the people down there, I can't believe what huge hearts everyone has.  Yeah.  It hits you in a way.  In fact, we're going to pass the jug around tonight for the Grey Jones Firehouse,  for the orphans and widows down there, for everybody. 
[00:17:30]  And so, beyond that, we're just going to have a really good time.  Yeah.  That's right, man.  Hell, yeah.  We love things.  The hogs and heifers, it's uptown, not downtown.  The one that's on 95th and 1st.  Yeah, right.  It's on 95th and 1st.  Yeah.  I'll be down there, Barry.  Okay.  All right, Dennis.  Hey, wait.  I've got to ask you real fast.  You flew with the Blue Angels?  Yeah, a couple of times.  How was that?  Well, one time, actually, I'm a pilot, so I got to fly it. 
[00:18:00]  That was something else.  And the second time, I was sitting back seat during a practice show.  And I felt really great for about 40 minutes.  And then I really just wanted to puke or just have him just take the plane right into the ground  because that was it.  Did you get an interest in that from doing the right stuff?  Yeah, that's when I started flying.  Oh, that is?  Yeah.  That was another just great movie, man.  Yeah, that was a cool movie.  It was a time of my life.  And then you decided to start flying. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  You have a jet license?  Yeah, I fly Citation Jets.  Look at this guy.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  What a life.  I know.  Yeah.  I'll be your co-pilot.  Okay, Bill.  All right, man.  We'll go to Florida Street.  We talk about that movie all the time on this radio show.  I can't get it out of my head.  We can't get enough of it.  All right.  Well, Dan said we know you've got to get ready.  Your guitar player has been listening in.  He wanted to hear.  Wait, let me see what he's all about. 
[00:19:00]  Jamie James?  Jamie.  Jamie.  Yeah.  Jamie James.  Yeah, I'm here listening.  Yeah.  Jamie.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I'm just making sure you guys ask all the right questions.  Otherwise, I'll have to come down there and kick your ass.  Jamie, you've been in bands how many years?  I've been playing.  I got my first electric guitar in 1966.  And Dennis is good and everything?  It's not like, oh, boy, we've got to play with Dennis.  Dennis is the real s***, man.  Dennis is the best guy I've ever played with.  That's cool, man.  That's been a good role already.  He was in the S-word on the air. 
[00:19:30]  Very nice, Jamie.  Thank you, you rock star.  We can see both of you guys.  I want to ask Jamie if we asked all the right questions, did we?  Yeah, you guys aced it, man.  We kind of tiptoed around the Meg Ryan thing, you know.  You guys aced it.  Yeah, right.  Tiptoed, all right.  Hey, Jamie.  You got dirt all over your pants legs, huh?  Jamie, you ever see Bill with Mickey Rooney?  He's here with me now.  He travels with us.  It's a great movie.  I would suggest everyone rents it.  You know what I would suggest?  Seriously, like Ann said, Frequency was unbelievable. 
[00:20:00]  Great movie, yeah.  That last scene, man, teary eyeballs.  Yeah.  When you're playing softball, it's like, wow, blew me away.  Yeah.  Hey, I want you to remember one thing about Mickey Rooney, though.  Yeah.  He was married to Ava Gardner.  Yeah, that's true.  The guy was like the hot shot of Hollywood for many years, man.  I used to bust a nut 24-7, man.  I got more ass than Russell Crowe.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Sorry, Dennis Berry.  I think Mick Doff. 
[00:20:30]  All right, guys.  I don't want to keep you any longer.  Say anything that would put off another interview at some other point.  So, Dennis, thanks a lot.  And, Jamie, have fun, man.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for being in a good sport, man.  There he is.  Dennis Quaid and his drummer, Jamie.  Jamie James.  Guitar player.  Sorry, guitar player.  There you go.  We'll get hogs and heifers.  Oh, boy.  Dennis Quaid and the sharks.  I'm going to go tonight.  I got to see Barry singing. 
[00:21:00]  He lost his mind.  And I started doing, Bill.  You know, I love being able to pull something out that you just damn well know no one talks to him about.  Bill.  You know, a lot of fun.  You ever think you'd see the day you get to talk to Dennis Quaid about Bill?  Dude, I've been doing that since 1981.  So, yeah, finally, it's been fun.  Make a left.  Remember that when he gets in Barry's car?  He gets in Barry's car, Mickey Rooney there and Dennis Quaid. 
[00:21:30]  And he goes, I want to go to my sister's.  So, he's telling Barry, he goes, go.  Okay, make a right.  Make a left.  He doesn't know where he's going.  He's just telling him, turn at the corner.  And then he sees a woman walking down the street.  He goes, there's Sarah, my sister's Sarah.  And he starts chasing her down the street.  He goes, Sarah.  It's just this little nutjaw Mickey with a toupee on his head and rotten teeth chasing this woman.  The woman turns around and goes, I am not Sarah.  My name is Ida. 
[00:22:00]  I am Ida.  Get away.  I have no money.  Get Dennis back on the phone.  We're going to mess with him some more.  Ah, what a lot of fun, man.  Dennis Quaid.  Who knew?  Who knew?  I'll be Anthony.  WNEW.  Hey, it happened.  I'm feeling glad I got sunshine.  In a bag, I'm useless.  Not for long, the future is coming out. 
[00:22:30]  Hey, it happened.  I'm feeling glad I got sunshine.  In a bag, I'm useless.  Not for long, my future is coming on.  It's coming on.  It's coming on.  It's coming on.  It's coming on.  All right, so someone asked about the four-foot pen with Ken Stevens, our boss.  Yeah.  And it's official.  We have signed our contracts, Anthony.  Yeah, we did that right after the show.  Right after the show. 
[00:23:00]  And then we boosted up with the boss, telling all sorts of fun stories.  Oh, yeah.  So after our little get-together after the show yesterday, it was getting too late to  jump on a train back to Long Island, so I have to stay in the city.  You stayed in town last night.  Got to do it.  But I wasn't prepared to stay in the city, as you will notice by the same clothes I'm  wearing today that I did yesterday.  Now, Opie, Manhattan, New York City here, very hard to get a room at the last minute. 
[00:23:30]  A lot of people like staying here.  Right, there's a hotel I frequent, and I just figured they'd have a room for me last  night.  Right.  Oh, they were sold out.  Uh-oh.  They were sold out.  Now I need to find a new hotel.  And I'm a little buzzed and a little tired, and I just need to find a room.  So you didn't want to start making calls and finding other hotels?  So I went to the crack hotel across the street.  I can't believe you stayed there. 
[00:24:00]  Ben was mortified.  You stayed at the crack hotel?  Ben prides himself on knowing New York and knowing where, like, the hip clubs are.  Yeah.  He'll tell you where all the cigar joints are.  He knows all this crap.  I know.  And if you need a good room.  He knows where the hip hotels are.  He knows which hotels you should stay away from because, you know, as Ben said, the sheets  are filled with, you know, I didn't say it, so don't dump out.  Ugh.  Man batter. 
[00:24:30]  Man batter.  Man batter all over the sheets.  So, uh...  Ugh.  So, I was tired, and my, you know, no rooms in the hotel I used, so I went across the street  to the crack hotel.  Did you see one of those real tight, curled-up black pubes on your pillow?  Oh.  It's nothing worse than knowing that a Hasidic Jewel fouled a hooker there about an hour  before.  This place is such a dump.  Ugh.  Such a dump.  And I'm in the lobby, and you get all these, you get all the rubes from all over the place 
[00:25:00]  that are coming to New York for the first time, and they, because this hotel is close  to Times Square, they're assuming it's a good hotel, because the lobby looks good.  Yeah.  It's Art Deco, Anthony, I believe.  Oh, yes, Art Deco.  Yeah, they make the lobby look good.  That means they just haven't remodeled it since Art Deco was new.  These people have no clue what the rooms look like until they get upstairs, and they're in  for a rude awakening.  Here's the key to toilets down the hall. 
[00:25:30]  Sheets are ten bucks extra.  It's one step above that.  Yeah.  Seriously.  We had, there's a rotary phone.  Mm-hmm.  There's a rotary phone.  There's a rotary phone in the room, right next to the bed, huge, huge mirror.  Uh-oh.  Huge mirror.  That's a bad sign.  You can see Opie asleep in his hotel bed on the internet somewhere.  Huge mirror.  Ridiculously.  Yeah.  I mean, it was the, it was the whole wall. 
[00:26:00]  After signing his very lucrative contract, Opie decides to spend in the tens of dollars on  a hotel room, staying here in midtown Manhattan at the Flush Crack Hotel.  No expenses spared as man-batter stains abound.  In this luxurious crap hole. 
[00:26:30]  You'll know what you've gotten yourself into when you grab the sticky doorknobs.  And that mirror next to the bed, full of video equipment.  And for a special surprise, open the closet.  You'll see a dead hooker.  Freshly killed.  The Crack Hotel.  You just signed your contract. 
[00:27:00]  Let me get this straight.  It's right after the show, we just signed our deal.  Yeah.  Feeling pretty good about ourselves.  Of course.  And you stay at a Crack Hotel.  Basically, I, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Air conditioning was busted, so I'm sweating all night.  Oh.  Oh.  Sticky sheets.  I, uh.  Located near the Carnegie Deli for all your pot needs.  And I, I also knew that I had to wear the same clothes today, so I wanted to keep them, 
[00:27:30]  keep them nice and fresh for today.  Opie's wardrobe never getting in the way.  Look at this closet, full of nothing.  So he wears the same cigar smelling shirt he wore last night.  And my underwear and my socks.  I didn't want to sleep, I didn't want to sleep in that stuff.  I hate sleeping naked.  I had to sleep naked. 
[00:28:00]  Don't like sleeping naked.  I had to sleep naked.  I had to cut the HIV in that bed.  Oh, my God.  Beware of hepatitis B.  Dude, wait a minute.  I had to.  Why?  I had to keep the undies fresh for today.  That's all I had.  What are you doing in your sleep that wouldn't keep them as fresh as when before you slept?  You know, you sweat a lot during the day.  I had to kind of, you know, rinse them out a little bit and put them on the heater.  Oh, like a soup kitchen in your pants. 
[00:28:30]  You're a pisser.  Wait a minute, but remember the sheets.  The undies, you know, they kind of look like used shoeshine rags.  You know, take care of stuff.  I would have slept in my clothes, in the bed.  Shoes, everything.  No, the AC, I finally got it to work.  And I got it blowing up some air to kind of keep my clothes fresh.  Airing out the clothes.  The sheets didn't fit the mattress. 
[00:29:00]  So I woke up in the middle of the night just sleeping on this crappy mattress, sweating like a pig.  Oh, my God.  Wait, the bare mattress?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, you got a disease.  You have a disease.  It was the worst.  The W, you know, outside my window.  Where most hotels serve crabs in the dining area, Opie got his in the bed.  All this and complimentary bloodstain removal. 
[00:29:30]  A place to hang your underwear while you sleep naked in our Petri dish bed.  All at the Crack Hotel in Midtown Manhattan.  Ben thinks that this hotel is used by all the hookers. 
[00:30:00]  The drive-by hookers that we were talking about a few weeks ago.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No doubt in my mind.  And, yeah, the W was flashing outside my window all night long.  The neon light.  Oh, right.  He's like, oh, I can't even get to sleep.  So then I wake up in the morning just drenched in, like, sweat on the mattress.  Just think if you were in there with a hooker, what they did before that.  Leaving all kinds of body fluids.  Body fluids abound in this luxury suite. 
[00:30:30]  So I go downstairs and I get the paper.  And I go back upstairs.  And I'm reading about us in the post today.  Did you put the paper down on the floor so your bare feet wouldn't hit the right?  And I had to laugh because...  I have to laugh.  There's an article in the post about Rush Limbaugh signing his contract for $250 million.  That's right.  And our big boss saying that he would have doubled his salary if he, you know, would have called him. 
[00:31:00]  I think Mel was joking, but...  And then they talk about some of the infinity properties.  Yes.  And some of the infinity syndicated shows.  And the amazing dynamic duo, Opie and Anthony.  I'm reading this in the crack hotel this morning.  Laying in a crappy bed covered in your own sweat.  Right.  With the light blinking outside your window.  Reading how you're one of radio's dynamic duo.  Up and coming stars.  I'm like, man, I might as well just have a freaking needle in my arm. 
[00:31:30]  Look at this place.  Watch out for the syringe.  Oh, man.  I had to laugh.  I'm reading and, yeah, there I am.  That is something, man.  After signing his lucrative contract, he took off his underwear and retired.  In the man-batter-stained bed. 
[00:32:00]  I had to rinse out the underwear first.  In front of a big mirror.  Who knows what's behind it?  All kinds of wonderful video equipment.  As you were watching the porno movie in your room, you were the porno room movie in 315.  You checked the TV guide.  So, what's naked radio personality? 
[00:32:30]  Let me click that.  Hey, hey.  Room service.  No room service.  Look at my hair.  Look at that.  I had to, like, I don't know.  Yeah, it's looking, like, kind of greasy.  Yeah, because it was the hotel shampoo and not even the good guy.  Oh, no, it probably wasn't shampoo.  Oh.  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to crank off a batch into the cream rinse bottle.  That's what I said.  That whore just beat me. 
[00:33:00]  Beat me out of my money.  I'm going to get the next whore that tried to shampoo her hair.  I'm going to crank off a batch right in the shampoo bottle.  Tony.  How you doing?  All right.  What's up?  Yo, how come, Opie, you just didn't sleep in your drawers and then free bag it today?  Yeah, why didn't you free bag it?  That's the safest, dude.  Why didn't you free bag it?  Any way you looked at it, though, you know, I had to take care of the undies.  What, dude?  No.  They were hurting.  Dude, you could have.  Dude, you could have at least. 
[00:33:30]  I should have.  At least, at the sun in that big deal, go out today after, you know, taking a shower and  buying a pair of underwear.  You only would have had to free bag it maybe for an hour.  Right.  I went to the Gap and bought a brand new shirt.  You could go to Dwayne Reed and pick up a package of underwear.  You could have done that.  You sleep in your underwear last night to just set up some kind of perimeter around your junk.  Do you guys understand that I could not continue wearing these underwear?  Well, I'll tell you this.  I took a girl to a hotel like that one time.  They were horrific.  Were they really a disaster area?  It was police tape around it. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  What happened?  Did you throw a puddle on your bike?  You know, it's like I'm the only one.  It was a hot day yesterday.  You're sweating like a pig as you're walking around and stuff.  You know, things happen.  Working up a lather.  Things happen.  Like the horses that pull the little wagons out here around Central Park on a hot day.  They work that foam up.  Were you working up the foam?  Well, uh...  There must have been hundreds of dingleberries in that bed.  Oh!  I just think everyone must say that. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, man.  This is filthy.  I'm going to take my underwear off.  It was, uh...  And you're just like, you might as well have just been...  Dude!  You know what's going on in those beds?  You know what was going on in the underpants?  Butterscotch comes to mind.  Put it this way.  If you walked in...  If you walked in that room, right?  Let's say you walk in the room.  There's a naked man in the bed.  He gets up, leaves the room.  Would you lay down in that bed?  They changed the sheets.  Oh, not at that place.  Not at that place, dude.  They had a Jamaican lady, you know, working the floors. 
[00:35:00]  How about you said the sheets didn't fit and they kept sliding off the matches and then  you wake up and you're on bare mattress?  And how many guys do you think that happens to?  I don't even want to think about it.  Everybody.  Very thin pillows.  Thin crack pillows.  It wasn't even a blanket.  It was just a spread.  No, wait a minute.  Now here comes another thing.  Spread.  Was it just one spread when you walked in the room?  Sheet spread.  Under the sheet.  Spread over the sheet.  There was no, like, top thing that you always throw off the bed the second you get in a hotel 
[00:35:30]  because those are the drunk people that just have sex instantly on that.  That was a spread.  That's what you used?  What are you going to do?  I need to be covered.  Oh, my God.  You have a communicable disease right now.  Right now.  No.  You've got to lock up your genitals in your underwear.  No sign of twatto walking around in your room?  No.  I just needed a room.  It was late, and I had a crash.  And I'm reading about how we're the up-and-coming radio stars from my room at the crack hotel. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, great.  What an image.  Opie's sack frothing like a cappuccino from Starbucks.  It looked like someone dropped a mochaccino in your pants.  So, there you have it.  Wow.  What a paradox, huh?  Yeah, it's funny.  People think we're doing so well, and it was pretty pathetic last night.  You're at the crack hotel. 
[00:36:30]  Crack hotel.  Why don't you go to the park or something?  It was right down the road.  Well, I checked out of the crack hotel.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You checked out?  Yeah, I didn't check out.  I'm going to stay somewhere else tonight.  Oh, you're staying in tonight, too?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Check out.  It's called fleeing the area.  I still got to find underwear for tomorrow, but...  Did you go to Dwayne Reed?  You're better off staying at Stinky's house than at that place.  With his roommate. 
[00:37:00]  Hey, man.  It's still better than the times I had a crash on Ben's couch.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Well, you don't know what's...  Oh, man.  Dude, that's awful.  Oh, dude, my...  Dude, that hotel is disgusting.  Your couch...  Every one of your friends that have moved from Boston have stayed on that couch, and you  haven't changed the sheets on that thing.  It's just as bad.  Plus, you get the extra bonus when you stay with Ben.  He wakes up in the middle of the night and giggles all night. 
[00:37:30]  And then his phone rings at 3 in the morning because one of his drunk friends is still out  and wants to talk to Ben at that moment.  Funny that's what he does.  I don't know when you sleep, Ben.  Dude, you'd have been safer just grabbing a refrigerator box and laying it in front of  the station's building.  Jesus Christ.  Dude, have you...  I'm serious now.  Have you checked yourself for crabs?  You really have to...  Look, during the break...  Please, listen to me.  Don't even start that.  When we go to break, go into the bathroom, really look around... 
[00:38:00]  I would know by now.  No, no, you might not.  Look, look, please.  You've got to check because if you spread crabs throughout this studio...  I'm not going to spread crabs!  We're the dynamic radio duo.  Just check.  You think the dynamic radio duo would get crabs?  Crabs are like kryptonite to the dynamic radio duo.  My God.  Ziggy's laughing at you right now.  I've got a better place than you.  Try explaining that STD to your girl.  No, serious. 
[00:38:30]  I caught these scabies from a crack hotel bed, I swear.  I have no STDs and I have no crabs.  Thank you very much.  Check for crabs.  Rick, you got crabs once, right?  How long did it take before you knew you had them?  A couple of days.  A couple of days.  And if you saw early, you might see one clinging.  They cling on to the hair like...  They just grab on.  Hold on.  They...  They multiply...  Actually, what I saw was...  You know, you look down, maybe you're sitting on the bowl...  And you look down at your underwear, you take a glance...  You're like, what's that? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, because there's all kinds of what?  Because the dead ones, after a while, they die.  They fall off into your underwear?  They fall off into your underwear.  Rick's got the crack hotel in his pants.  So you look down into your underwear and you saw...  It looked like dandruff.  And I'm like, what the hell is that?  What color was it?  It was like a...  Like a...  I don't know.  It looked like onion flakes.  Oh, okay.  It looked like onion flakes in your underwear.  So what did you do?  You picked one up?  Yeah.  And saw it had legs?  I picked one up.  And you've got to look really close at it like, oh my God, that's a bug. 
[00:39:30]  I got a bug.  And then you're like, why is there a bug in my underwear?  Yeah, exactly.  And then you look down at your area and you just saw them crawling around?  No.  I just immediately pulled up my pants and went to the doctor and I had to get it like,  you know, get the shampoo.  Get the shampoo.  I'll be scratching.  And he's scratching your head.  Dude, don't scratch.  Get in the bathroom, check.  Dude, shut up.  You never know.  I'm doing it for your own protection and everyone else's.  You never know in those beds. 
[00:40:00]  Oh my God.  I had a slight itch.  Oh my God, don't scratch.  Gross.  Oh my God.  I'm fine.  But it was an interesting night, to say the least.  And then reading about us in the paper while I was in that situation, I'm like, man, what  the hell?  Reading about us in an article that contains figures like 25 million and huge radio companies.  And there you are in the crack hotel in my own sweat, naked, because I'm still waiting 
[00:40:30]  for my underwear to dry.  He walked in there, the crabs, like an amusement park, just sat down.  Come on.  All right.  It's a fleece circus.  Well, you know what?  Screw you guys.  I'm never sharing again.  F you.  Well, you can share the stories, just don't share anything you bring back from these rooms.  Get your balls out.  Slap your ass up.  Slap your scrotum.  It's today.  Though it may not be anyone's birthday. 
[00:41:00]  And it's not near the 4th of July.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Now, the station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is  This Station, 1027 WNEW, New York.  Opie and Anthony on your radio.  Old Dirty in the studio.  Hello.  Natalie, what's going on?  Hi, gentlemen.  Hello.  Hi.  I got a question. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Why is it acceptable and not considered homophobic for, in the game of football, a quarterback  that basically has his complete arm up the guy's rear end of who's snapping it?  Well, that is pretty homo.  You're right.  But that's acceptable to you.  You'd always laugh as a kid.  You know, it's a little weird.  Okay.  Just wondering, like, where you draw the line.  You know, I played a lot of sports in high school.  Can never get into that patting on the ass thing, man. 
[00:42:00]  Look, yo, go on, man.  I hated that.  Happened all the time.  High school wrestling, too.  Nice shot.  Nice shot.  And they're patting you on the butt.  Get your hand on my ass.  Or the towel snap in the shower.  The towel snapping in the shower, that just doesn't happen.  That's just total gayness.  That's folklore.  Folklore.  That never happened, right?  Have you ever...  Come on.  I mean, every guy that's listening to us had to take showers with other guys in school  and stuff.  Never did.  Never had the towel snapping going on. 
[00:42:30]  Never did.  Wouldn't know.  You guys did showers in high school.  Never did.  I hated it.  Yo, they never had that.  Thank you, Natalie.  Thank you, Kyle.  All right.  Yeah, you were in high school.  It was probably like a prison race scene in the shower.  Jesus Christ.  Lockdown.  They had showers and all that.  Lockdown high.  I think, yo, no, no.  You know what they did?  They turned the showers into a locker room.  You never showered after gym class in school?  Yeah, me.  Yo, that's my word.  We used to stink and go to social studies and be like, used to bring cologne and all  that.  Then your head got all freaked out. 
[00:43:00]  Well, you are Puerto Rican, Dominican, whatever.  You know, cologne.  What's that?  Cologne, shower.  Same thing.  Oh, my God.  Yo, OP, man.  Cologne.  Cologne, shower.  Same thing.  Great.  It's the Puerto Rican shower, man.  Let me bathe real quick.  I just wouldn't take a shower in class.  I was such an introverted little kid in school, too.  I would just go to my classes, go to gym, not even change, you know? 
[00:43:30]  I'd be the guy with the friggin' jeans on and the fur coat.  With the Delaney car.  And just like my shoes.  Fur coats.  My hush puppies.  It was a drag for me.  Jim Teicher hated me.  I developed real late, and I'm in the shower.  I'm the only guy that doesn't have, like, freaking...  No hair, kid?  Oh, God.  It's just like...  It looks like a Purdue chicken.  It looks like young William Hosea.  A young man's boy. 
[00:44:00]  It looks like you're in the shower.  Yes, dear boy.  Woo!  It looks like a Purdue chicken leg.  It just sucked.  I'm like, oh, God.  What a cool joke this is.  Jim Teicher hated me.  I would just come in, and, like, my hair was in that transition between straight and going  completely, like, bat-ass curly.  So I had no clue what to do with it.  So I would just, like, leave it. 
[00:44:30]  I'd wake up.  It was all over the place.  You're a kid, you know?  And I would just put on, like, a shirt and pants, and I'm untalked and stuff.  I didn't care.  I was just, like I said, like an introverted little kid.  I'd just walk around.  And the Jim Teicher, this big, brawny, schmucko, friggin' militant asswife.  Get over here!  Come here!  Toes on the line!  And I'm standing there, oh, yeah, like I'm a soldier now, you know?  In the army of this friggin' nut.  Toes on the line to play with a huge... 
[00:45:00]  Huge, oversized ball.  Great.  Yeah, great.  So I'm standing there, and he looked at me, and he, like, he goes down the line like he's  inspecting the troops.  He stops me, he's like...  Look at the way you groom yourself, man.  Like, what?  What?  He did.  He said that.  Look at the way you groom yourself, man.  I'm just looking at him, and he's got...  He's got, like, these huge friggin', like, muscle man arms, and he's just standing.  I'm like, what? 
[00:45:30]  What?  You know, what do I know?  I don't know nothing.  Look at your hair.  Why don't you brush your hair?  Straighten yourself up, man.  Like, I'm at the rehab clinic.  I'm a dopey kid.  That's how I was.  That was it.  And the guy, like, trying to give me some kind of complex.  It must have worked.  I still remember it.  You didn't?  Jesus Christ.  You didn't pay attention when...  Not a bit, Opie.  When they were, you know, showing you the film, Anthony, about hygiene and all that.  Look the way Mike brushes his hair. 
[00:46:00]  Anthony isn't brushing his hair.  He's Mr. Bungle.  See that lice coming off Anthony's neck?  Anthony doesn't offer Susie a seat in the cafeteria.  Mike always offers Susie a seat.  Anthony's Mr. Bungle.  Look at the way he grooms himself.  And were you the guy that had, like, the shorts, the t-shirt, and the denim jacket on?  No, because I didn't...  Yeah, you know.  Remember those kids? 
[00:46:30]  I didn't put the shorts on.  I didn't change.  I stood there.  I had my shoes on.  I never...  And I would just stand there.  And, like, that was it.  I didn't care.  Oh, yeah, all the time.  All the time.  I hated gym.  It was the dumbest thing.  I wasn't, like...  Because they were the sports kids.  Like, there were five or so in every gym class that were just, like, totally into it.  They knew all the friggin' teams and everything and just...  I wasn't into it. 
[00:47:00]  I was more into science.  I didn't like...  I was like a nerd.  In our school, when you took gym, too, they made you play stupid sports.  Yeah.  Badminton.  Also, we're playing badminton.  Why are we playing badminton?  I didn't even care.  I didn't care what sport we were playing.  I didn't care what sport we were playing.  We did go to Westchester Country Club?  Pretty much.  Run some laps.  Where's your uniform?  Uniform.  What is this?  The Waffen SS?  My uniform.  It's shorts.  Pal.  The gym teachers were the worst. 
[00:47:30]  You're like, I'm dressed in your uniform.  I was, like, ready to just grab some kind of uniform.  All right, here you go, Boy Scout.  There, it's a uniform.  You had a guy gym teacher?  Yeah, it was a guy's gym class.  Yeah, well, we had...  You had a girl gym teacher?  We had the dyke, Johnny Bulls.  No, the girls' gym class had the dyke gym teacher.  No, we had a dyke one, too.  All right, there's a problem.  And you were showering.  They didn't come into the shower with you?  They were in the same friggin' place. 
[00:48:00]  They could walk out of their little office into the locker room.  They never did.  Oh, as far as you know.  They weren't going to say nothing on me anyway.  I could care less.  I don't know.  The dyke gym teacher, I always remember as being the girls' gym teacher.  Yeah.  And they'd shut those big separating doors with the other little door, the accordion door,  and that was it.  I remember right before it would close, you'd look at a girl and just go, oh, bye.  See ya.  Bye, girls.  See ya.  See ya.  That's it.  And I'm stuck with it.  Right away.  You're growing yourself, man.  Man? 
[00:48:30]  I'm not a man.  I'm a very small lad at this point.  And on the other side of that big door, the dyke gym teacher.  Oh, there was sex parties going on.  We all know that.  Dyke teacher was trying to get a look at the young little teenage chick.  All right.  We're going to do some rope climbing today, girls.  Up the rope.  I'm going to hold the bottom of the rope here so it doesn't jiggle around on you while  you're climbing it so much.  And we don't want to weigh you down with those cumbersome panties.  You've got to take those off.  And shorts.  So it's going to be naked rope climbing and then I will hold the rope at the bottom. 
[00:49:00]  Yo, now thinking about it, yo, that freaking rope was high.  Yeah, it had to go all the way up to the ceiling for that.  Yeah.  Yo, now that I think of it, I think it was high, yo.  You know what, though?  I didn't mind going to the top because that's when I finally figured out that this thing  was used for something else.  On the rope.  Oh.  Yeah, when I was young.  Dude, that is sick.  What did you do with the rope?  That's like he was rubbing his thing against the wall.  Like humping it like a poodle on company.  No, no, no, no.  Let me find out you were a bird. 
[00:49:30]  No, I was sliding down and went, oh my God, there's something else going on down there.  Yeah?  That's how I figured it out.  That's when you discovered your schwing.  Hell yeah.  That's like in the shape of a...  Look at Rick going shining.  Rick is always trying to turn everything into some homo thing.  It's the shape of a big schwing.  You're sliding down a long schlong.  Yeah, that's what I'm doing, Rick.  That's exactly what I think.  I wish you could see O.P.'s face when he totally writes off, Rick.  That's the funniest thing.  You know, Rick, that's exactly what I'm thinking when I'm banging your sister. 
[00:50:00]  Oh!  That's just like the big rope in grammar school.  That's what I'm thinking.  You think my sister's a big schlong?  It's like Rick's sister or a big rope from gym class.  Let me think about this one for a while.  It's getting personal.  Rope would have been cheaper for me to send on a cruise.  Oh, Dirty, you were way out of the conversation today. 
[00:50:30]  Did you even hear this one?  Yeah, I heard it.  Oh, okay.  Aunt just found out, and I was scared because, you know, I'm like,  God damn, I don't want to pay for this cruise.  And I was praying to you.  Pay for the cruise?  You barely give me my 20 bucks back or do you borrow it for the train?  I didn't pay for the cruise.  So I'm like sitting here going,  Oh, I pray Aunt doesn't find out that he paid for my chick's cruise.  I paid for his chick to fly down to Florida,  go on a cruise down in the Caribbean for a week, 
[00:51:00]  fly back to New York,  pay for my Anthony.  You had to pay two dogs.  I never even saw her naked.  Not even a picture.  I haven't either lately.  Uh-oh.  That's a joke.  Where am I sending her for next vacation?  Old Dirty, I'm sweating because I'm like,  man, I don't want to pay that bill, man.  It's like a G&T, right?  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Tell me about it.  I thought it was all on the slide,  like Aunt would never find out, 
[00:51:30]  but he finally got out.  I finally put two and two together.  It's like, wait a minute.  I was just hoping you thought it was like a real expensive cruise.  It was.  Well, yeah, for two people,  but I was hoping you got the bill and thought,  wow, that was just a real expensive cruise for one person.  Wow.  Amex, I got enough points on my American Express from that cruise  to take my own cruise.  Like, oh, and then, you know, I paid it, 
[00:52:00]  and then I'm thinking.  Over vacation, I'm thinking.  I'm assessing, like, finances and everything.  Yeah, after you write the check.  And then it's like, wait a minute.  I go online to do my banking,  and I look at any deposits that were in it.  There was no deposit matching that price.  Like, I paid for Sandy's cruise.  Oh.  All right, I'll pay you back.  You know, it's not your fault.  It's not mine either, but it wasn't my idea. 
[00:52:30]  I know.  Wow.  She needed a shoulder to cry on.  Yeah, well, it's an expensive shoulder, for God's sake.  Jiminy Cricket.  Yumping Jiminy.  Anyway.  Oh, Jesus.  There's some great phones waiting to go on the air,  but we've got to take a quick break.  If you're on hold, we're going to go to you next really fast, okay?  You've got to pay for me to go somewhere now.  Sandy's got to pay for me and you to go sunning and jet ski.  Oh, wait.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:53:00]  You're going to bring the rope?  Where's Sandy going to get the money from?  You.  Yeah, exactly.  She's going to get it from Jim.  Exactly.  Jesus.  All right, so let's take a quick break.  If you're on hold, stay right there, okay?  More of the Opie and Anthony show in just a bit.  Next Monday on the Opie and Anthony show,  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  1027. 
[00:53:30]  WNEW.  Shut up.  We're trying to broadcast, O.D.  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  O.D. in the studio today.  Hang with us.  Yo, yo.  Trying to head to the show.  Still waiting for something to come out of his mouth.  Oh.  He did.  No, I appreciate it.  Oh, I forgot that guy.  Wait, let's talk to...  Oh, wait.  Eva, hold on a sec.  What do you got, Ed?  Guy, Peter, from my old hometown. 
[00:54:00]  Do you remember playing dodgeball at Elwood Junior High with Coach Kazaza?  Trying to give innocent 14-year-olds concussions.  This guy, Coach Kazaza...  Boy, name from the past.  Coach Kazaza.  He would take you into, I don't know what it was, the deepest bowels of Elwood Junior High  into like a boiler room thing.  Wow.  Yeah, tell me about it.  With the little red dodgeball thing.  Remember the sound it made when it hit your head?  Boom.  There you go.  Boom. 
[00:54:30]  And he would just like go at it.  Like two split up the teams and you play dodgeball in this padded room in the boiler.  It was like some kind of prison experience.  And then he'd jump in every so often.  If the ball bounced off the wall and he grabbed it, boom.  Like wing it like a howitzer at your head.  What a sadistic bastard.  Bam, dodgeball.  Very sadistic game.  Yeah.  Anyway.  In the boiler room, what is it?  The WWF?  It was a boiler room match.  Boiler room brawl.  If you ever turned your back accidentally in dodgeball, you couldn't turn back around. 
[00:55:00]  Because you knew the second you turned around, that ball would be right in your face.  Oh!  No, there it is.  But it had a crazy sting to it, too, bro.  I never got hit in the ground.  Yeah, you know the guy with the big red wealth on the side of his face?  Experience so already.  He's still got it.  The big red wealth.  You're out.  Walk it off.  Walk it off.  Be a man.  Take the pain.  Take the pain.  All right, let's go to the phones here.  Eva, what's going on?  Eva.  Eva, sorry. 
[00:55:30]  What's up?  That's okay.  Listen, first, I just want to...  You're very funny.  And I really enjoy you being funny.  You make my day go by quicker.  Why are you calling David?  And also, what did you say?  You're a joke.  What?  I didn't hear you.  No problem.  Nothing.  Oh.  It wasn't meant for you.  All right, you're being silly.  Okay.  Okay.  And the other thing was, this free-for-all this afternoon was also very funny.  Yeah, it was.  By the way.  The race is going at it.  It was very, very...  I wanted to make a comment, but you guys didn't have time for me. 
[00:56:00]  Anyway, you are...  The one thing I have to say is you're being hypocrites because it was less than two weeks  ago that you were screaming that you've never, ever been in a shower with any other men  ever.  But in high school, it happens a lot.  Yeah.  So, you're screaming about...  You said just a few minutes ago that, oh yeah, everybody in high school has to take a shower,  blah, blah, blah.  And ha-ha, you're beeping the horn. 
[00:56:30]  That's very funny.  I think you should look.  Um, but, uh, I'm wondering if you were swearing that you'd never, ever...  Let's get together with my practice radio show to get hit by the 515, Kate.  Oh, she never saw it coming.  Is the caller there?  Ava?  Hello, Ava. 
[00:57:00]  Uh, Ava?  No, she couldn't jump out of the way.  It feels good breaking that out for the new millennium, huh?  Come on!  For the millennium.  Ah, that just felt good.  She never saw it coming.  Getting the first one out of the way.  Uh, who's this?  Yo!  Yeah.  What's your name?  This is Royal.  Royal?  Yep.  Uh-oh.  All right, Royal, what's up?  Uh, here's a statistic gym teacher story, and, uh, Anthony's a little bombardment.  Our dodgeball story kind of ties in.  Okay. 
[00:57:30]  Uh, gym teacher, Mr. Warner, uh, we called it a bombardment, and he would line us up on  opposite sides of the basketball court.  Instead of using a red dodgeball, we only wish we had a red dodgeball, because we would  use half-deflated basketballs.  Oh!  And he would go, freshman-verse.  So you've got the varsity pitcher winging half-deflated basketballs, and then he'd say,  okay, there would be about five freshmen left, and they'd all line up on the wall, just sort  of like targets. 
[00:58:00]  And he'd be, okay, upperclassmen anywhere.  If you hit one freshman, your whole team comes back in.  Well, that wasn't good enough, so he devised a penalty box, and he'd get a wrestling mat,  and he'd set it up as like a box on his edge.  And if he felt, for whatever reason, you were trying deliberately to get out by, like,  sticking your hand out instead of getting it hit in the head, he'd stick it, he'd say,  all right, shirt's off, you have to take your shirt off, get in the mat, and then they 
[00:58:30]  could just walk up to you and wang you in the kidneys.  What the hell's wrong with him?  Pretty sadistic.  A lot of them are, man.  They're gym teachers.  They're just bitter.  There was one in John Glenn who, uh, this big, uh, fat guy, used to call him giblets.  And he, uh, he played for the, uh, Denver Broncos until a leg injury, like, ruined his  career, and he ends up being a gym teacher.  This guy was so friggin' bitter, he would just abuse the students. 
[00:59:00]  It was amazing.  He hit some kid with a pipe once.  Another time, he would, if he caught you smoking, he would give you the option.  I will take you down to the office and tell him you were smoking, or you get one punch in  the chest from me.  Get out of here!  I swear to God, and then you'd go into the locker room, you'd stand there, he'd wind  up and punch you in the chest so friggin' hard, you'd fly across the room.  Didn't he, didn't he know that's how Harry Houdini died?  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  And, uh, when he hit the kid with the lead pipe, that was when he got fired.  He hit some kid with a lead pipe over the head.  What am I, Mr. Urban Legend guy?  You know me.  I only speak the truth.  It happened.  He was from the East.  In our, uh, school.  In John Glenn.  Why would he, why would he even hit a guy with a lead pipe?  If you knew the kid, you'd have hit him too.  It was that.  Little Slater, I think.  All right.  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff, what's going on today?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good.  I just wanted to bring back, uh, two, uh, games from the old elementary school days. 
[01:00:00]  I went to school in Long Island, and we used to play with the dodge balls, but there was  a big inflatable medicine ball in the middle that you used to have to hit back and forth.  And it was kind of like a tug-of-war kind of thing.  You had to knock the ball back and forth.  And then the other one was, uh, when you used the small balls to, uh, play handball.  And your hands used to come out stinging and all red, broken fingers and stuff.  Play asses up handball.  Like a record.  I played asses up. 
[01:00:30]  I played asses up.  I would never play asses up.  All that.  I played asses up.  That sucked.  You're standing at the wall, asses up.  Someone takes the ball and wings it at your ass when you look.  And you know what the worst part was?  Not when it hit your ass.  When someone was real good, could ricochet it off the wall.  And they nail you in the nuts.  So you did play asses up.  I saw many games of asses up.  I played asses up.  That game sucked.  The best was when they could really aim and just get, like, the skin right, like, here. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Just wing you.  Like, like, blow your package on your leg to the, oh, God.  You guys had, like, the awesome gymnasium curriculum, yo.  Oh, yeah.  You never played asses up or handball?  We had, look, we had handball.  Like, Chinese handball.  You had a drive-by shooting.  What else did you have in your curriculum?  We had bagel-ology.  Because we used to go to the corner and try different bagels.  Cut out a gym class.  Yo, what you having today, raisin? 
[01:01:30]  What up, man?  I mean, in New York City public high schools, you know, they're, I mean, if there's not a  football team, you know what I'm saying?  The football team and the baseball team and the basketball team, they get all the props  from the gym teacher.  Hell, yeah.  They don't even got to show up.  Right.  You know, they get the little delaying card.  Oh, that's my center.  Excuse him.  And they'll be in gym, like, for the whole day.  But the rest of us, you know, we have to thug it out for two periods playing basketball.  And they never gave us, you know, none of that dodgeball. 
[01:02:00]  You know, that was whack, yo.  I think that's why.  Yeah, they just throw you basketballs in the city school.  Let's go here, play.  Odds are a large percentage of the children will enjoy this.  It's a problem of basketball.  It doesn't matter.  Eli.  Yo, ONA, what's up?  What's up?  How's it going there, guys?  I got a story for you.  Junior high.  Swear to God, we used to do square dancing.  Yeah, I was there.  What was the meaning to square dancing in school?  I don't know.  You know what?  I used to say the same thing. 
[01:02:30]  I wasn't going to live down south to be with all the hicks and doing square dancing.  There was one good thing about square dancing, though.  You lined up, and you started counting off going, okay, one, two, three.  All right, I got to change places with the guy in front of me.  You want that chick.  You know, that was the one thing that brought the two.  They flung the doors open, and the boys met the girls.  Here come the Phillies.  And now it was co-ed.  Co-ed.  And you would.  You would line up.  Like Ope said, you're counting. 
[01:03:00]  Because you wanted to be with, like, the girl that you wanted to be with.  But unbeknownst to me.  I wanted to be with Camille, the first girl that grew boobies.  Yeah.  There was a girl I wanted to be with that I can't remember.  And as I'm counting, a girl is counting to be with me.  So it didn't matter where I ended up.  Yes.  Pam Bernfeld.  I ended up across from her.  Who I dubbed president of the itty-bitty team.  There was a problem there. 
[01:03:30]  And, yeah, lined up.  I just remember, okay, hold hands.  Which was kind of cool, though, in, like, junior high.  Because they'd, like, rig you up with these girls and stuff.  And you'd have to hold hands.  And then when you'd switch partners and stuff, that was kind of cool.  And you're holding hands.  Remember the feeling you get?  It was a great feeling.  Oh, girl.  Oh, it's a girl hand.  Oh.  Oh, nice.  And she's holding mine all sweaty and frigging clammy.  You guys look, like, backwards out there in the island.  Hey, guys.  One more thing.  Suffolk County.  Come on.  We're playing banjos in our spare time. 
[01:04:00]  Back then, anyway.  I drank mine.  What if you were sick the day they were choosing?  And you come back.  I came back one day.  Then you get the teacher?  And you're, like, you're stuck with, like, you know, heinous Helen, who's, like, this lump in the corner just finally strolls out.  You know, I would have taken anything back then.  Who cares?  It's female.  You know?  The spare dancer's so lame.  You're not thinking about what they look like.  You're just, like, oh, female.  They put that cheesy record on.  Right.  Yeah, they had the... 
[01:04:30]  Swing your pot and round and round.  Beat on the head and throw on the ground.  All the names.  Up and down across the floor.  There's a mouse to get in.  That's a big whore.  How is that going to benefit us in future life, you know?  Square dancing.  Square dancing.  I'll be at an interview at IBM.  But did you ever square dance?  Oh, damn.  Yeah, I did.  All right.  You got the job.  Hey, John, you're next.  What's up?  How's it going, guys?  All right.  Dodgeball.  Dodgeball fun.  When I was in high school, they used to line the balls up in the middle of the floor in a lunchroom. 
[01:05:00]  It was a slick floor, and they'd make everybody run in to get the balls.  Oh, that's good.  So you're two feet away from each other when you first start lunging the balls at each other.  Yeah, but one of the guys flew on the knees.  They cracked skulls.  One of the guys got knocked unconscious.  He's got some brain damage, you know?  Oh, man.  That's great.  They had those red balls.  You could palm the thing.  They were the small ones.  So it would just be in your head.  It would knock you unconscious anyways, man.  That was excellent.  You guys suck, man.  Thanks.  Look at this guy, Tim, said, we got a guy in asses up who could hit your sack from behind every time. 
[01:05:30]  Like, there was a guy that you just knew was like, oh, no.  Oh, I got asses up, and it's against this guy.  The ricochet shot.  And do the dodgeball sound effect again.  I love that.  Boom.  And it just flies, right?  It just bounces off your forehead.  That was the same ball they used in kickball.  There's a sport.  Kickball.  We had a girl that struck out in kickball every time. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, nothing more pathetic than striking out in kickball.  Every time.  Same girl that would pee her pants, too.  It's been great.  Oh, that's sad.  It was hilarious because, like, where we're from, I mean, you went all the way from kindergarten to high school with the same people.  And you remember this girl as being the one.  I won't even give her name because I'm sure she still lives in Centiport.  But she would strike out in kickball and pee her pants every day.  Oh, my God.  Every day at, like, 1 o'clock where the teacher.  Horrible. 
[01:06:30]  Where we had the teacher that had the little panties in her drawer that she had to take and then give it to the girl.  And she'd come back in the room.  Oh, that's pretty sad.  To learn some more.  This is the same girl we saw strutting around high school years later.  Like, no one's just dating.  Drutting or just kind of sulking?  Slulking.  But you remember what she used to do and no one wanted to, like, date her.  You don't want to be the guy that dated the girl that used to pee herself.  And strike out in kickball.  And I feel a little jealous, man.  What?  I just had, like, an all-American high school experience.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:07:00]  We were out there where there were white people.  You had that Fast Times high school experience.  Yeah, it was like Fast Times.  Well, during what high school I went to, same one as Mariah Carey.  Oh, the one she had the show on?  They just did the show on Fox.  And I'm just waiting for the call to come back to my high school.  Oh, yeah.  That phone will be ringing.  Sure.  Opie, we need you at Harborfield.  Spin records.  Yeah, spin records in the cafeteria.  And I want to go back to my high school.  And then we'll go to Ants High School, John Glenn.  And we want to do a live radio show. 
[01:07:30]  Well, I wanted to last year.  I don't know what.  Maybe we'll have less of a problem this year.  Since we're so world-renowned now.  So popular.  Maybe I could get my diploma from John Glenn.  No, I need a gym credit, dude.  Yeah, that's right.  I swear, I need gym credit.  So I'm willing to come in and attend a gym class if they give me my diploma from John Glenn.  Yeah.  I would damn well do that.  Get in touch with John Glenn High School.  Tell him, I want my goddamn diploma.  I'll go to gym. 
[01:08:00]  I'll dress in the shorts.  I'll climb the rope.  You know, that would be awesome.  Yeah.  That would be fun.  Yeah.  Then maybe I could get a real job.  See, kids, you don't need a high school as a kid.  No, kids, drop out.  You don't need it.  Drop out.  Look at your pal Ant.  Colleen, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  Great.  I am a female phys ed teacher in New York City.  Okay.  In Brooklyn.  And I am most definitely not a bike.  You got the short, spiky hair on top, long in the back? 
[01:08:30]  No, I don't have short, spiky hair on the top.  You like looking at the naked little nymphs?  Colleen, I got a question for you.  Yes.  So why didn't you pay attention in school?  I did.  I know she wanted to be a...  See, now I have this argument all the time.  What did you want to be before you said, you know what, screw it, I'm going to be a gym teacher?  It's phys ed.  Phys ed.  Sorry.  Oh, phys ed.  It's not gym anymore.  Okay.  She's going to be a physical therapist.  I can't tell you.  I have 20 credits in science that I had to take to get a degree.  I was going to be a ballerina.  Science.  No, I was not. 
[01:09:00]  That is not my thing.  All right.  I don't teach dodgeball.  No?  No.  So...  You didn't have any kind of aspirations towards, you know, like sports or something?  Like being the home ec teacher?  No, I didn't know I was a home ec teacher.  When you were growing up, you didn't possibly say to yourself, I want to be a female gym teacher.  Phys ed.  Phys ed gym teacher.  You got a chrome whistle?  Come on, ladies.  We're going to go on the balance beam. 
[01:09:30]  We don't have mats, so I'll act as the mat today.  You don't need those pesky underwear.  Oh, stop.  I'll just stay under here.  Oh, look at you, you little thing.  Wow, it's still in the shape of a diamond.  It's not at all even remotely like that.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen plenty.  They are.  No, but I'm not.  You can't love us all together.  I'm sorry.  My husband would disagree with you.  Ah, what's her name?  He's not going to be happy.  He's listening. 
[01:10:00]  Pat.  The androgynous Pat.  There you go.  Oh, we're just messing with you, Colleen.  That's fine.  All right.  All right.  Very well.  Have a good night.  You too, Colleen.  Bye.  Bye.  A woman's perspective on Jim.  Vicki.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Good.  Very good.  I tried being in seventh grade with a C cup playing medicine ball.  Nice.  You had a couple of medicine balls of your own.  Yeah, I did.  I was the first one to develop.  Oh, God.  The guys have never forgotten you. 
[01:10:30]  To this day, they mention your name.  Yeah, they know.  They come up to me now.  Ready?  Ready?  I'll play it with everyone in the room.  Okay.  And first girl that grew boobs.  I don't remember last name, but first name.  Sixth grade, Cuba Hill Elementary School.  Jerry.  Jerry was her name.  Rick?  Go to Old Dirty first.  She kicked me in the crotch, too.  The bitch.  Everyone in their car right now is naming a name.  Every guy.  For me, it was Camille Brumner.  Oh, I'm flattered. 
[01:11:00]  This is terrible, though.  Those medicine balls are hurt.  I'm telling you.  Is it Maribel?  You know what Old Dirty's problem is?  He can't think back to second grade.  Oh, don't make fun of Old Dirty.  He went to a rough school.  Old Dirty.  Old Dirty.  Just remember, the last time you were in school.  Oh, man.  You guys make me laugh today with this stuff.  And I got to tell you about the square dancing.  Yeah.  The girls, they hated it, but inside, they loved it.  They wanted to dance with the boys.  They had their pick.  And you're right.  They did pick their hands.  Let me tell you something.  I didn't mind the square dancing because we got to touch females. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, that was the whole thing.  Even just touching hands was pretty cool.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And if you didn't like the girl you were with, they would do that thing where it's like,  you know, exchange your partner.  Uh-huh.  And you go forward.  The forward would be gone.  You go across.  And at that age, they didn't even care.  It was female.  All that mattered to me.  No, girls are different though.  See, girls get together.  Because what is that?  That's like third or fourth grade, right?  Sometimes you have faith.  It's up to...  It never made it to junior high.  Yeah.  It was grammar school.  Yeah.  But the girls, they sit together and they go, okay, you can have this guy today. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  And unless they fight over it.  All right.  So, thank you.  Thank you, Vicki.  Take care, guys.  With the lovely...  Are they still C's or are they up to D's?  Yeah, no, I'm very short.  They're still C's.  Okay.  All right.  You want to square dance?  You want to?  A little dirty, trying to...  Brian, you're next.  Hey.  Hey.  O&A?  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on?  All right.  I went to school growing up in Manhattan.  Junior high school, high school, elementary school, everything.  We played kill the man with the ball.  Kill the guy with the ball. 
[01:12:30]  Remember that game?  In our neighborhood.  It was football, no rules.  You just kill the guy with the ball.  In our neighborhood, it was called Smear the Queer.  Yeah, we played that out.  Smear the Queer.  Swear to you.  We played that out at recess.  We didn't know what queer meant back then, but that was the name of the game.  Yeah, we played it on concrete, like out in the street.  I remember getting tackled, and I lost one of my teeth, and both teams are running around  the park looking for my tooth.  There was always a guy that just, I mean, you're playing like kill the guy with the  ball, and his arm would just snap, and the bone would pop right through. 
[01:13:00]  There was always one guy.  Exactly.  All right, man.  Exactly.  And then growing up in school, we played that in high school, in junior high school,  and then when I went to junior high school, I went to the lower east side of Manhattan.  Yeah.  And then it was more just like kill anybody.  It turned into like kill the white guy for no reason.  Forget about kill the man with the ball.  It was just kill the white guy.  All right.  Well, thank you, Brian.  You're welcome.  I want to take a break, but Russ swears that he had a midget gym teacher.  Oh, come on.  Hey, Russ.  Hey, how you doing? 
[01:13:30]  How you doing?  Hey, forget about it.  Forget about it.  What's up, Russ?  Yeah.  In high school, we had a midget gym teacher.  I am not lying.  Oh, my God.  He was about four foot.  We called him Oompa Loompa.  Totally didn't get nothing done.  Oompa Loompa.  I swear to God.  So, hey, you can go to my own high school and just like pass this class.  That's weird, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was really weird.  I mean, we had like a normal gym teacher.  Of course, the lesbian gym teacher for the girls.  But you had like mini-me teaching your gym. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Mini-me was the gym teacher.  And we just like totally, you know, towards the end, he was like asking us, just do one  of something.  That's pretty weird.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you, Russ.  Bye.  Bye.  And with that, let's take a quick break.  We'll be back, okay?  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW. 
[01:14:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey.  In the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Your disaster show.  Holy ass.  Anywhere else outside of New York.  866-277.  For a while. 
[01:15:00]  We're a beaten city.  Well, the latest plane crash, a hundred yards to our north, actually.  It was so close when it happened.  Jesus Christ.  We're a beaten city.  I can't even believe when I woke up.  First of all, I'll tell you, I stayed in town, thank God, because I never would have gotten  in from Brooklyn.  No way.  No show today.  I turned around and hid in my bedroom. 
[01:15:30]  So I have the alarm set for like 10.04, I guess it was set for.  And it goes off.  It's one of those, you know, clock alarm, clock radio things.  So it's on one of those stations.  And I hear the traffic guy doing a traffic report at 10.04.  Now, in New York, you know you get it on the 8s and the 1s, depending on what station.  So the alarm goes off, and you hear traffic guy.  On the 4s.  And you look at, and it's 10.04.  And he says, he goes, and word now coming in, and then my girlfriend leans over and  turns the radio off.  So that's all you heard. 
[01:16:00]  I'm like, but I'm thinking, I'm like, there's something strange going on here.  And I'm hearing, wee, wee, outside.  So then I go, all right, I remember the phone ringing, so someone left me a message on my  cell phone.  So I go to check my messages on the cell phone.  All circuits are busy.  I'm like, uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Last time this happened, it was a couple of months ago.  So I go, give me the remote.  And I winced.  I actually winced, pointed it to the TV, and hit on to see what it was all about. 
[01:16:30]  And I just see a fire, and American Airlines plane, the text on the bottom.  Ah, this is great.  This is good.  You can't imagine.  You can't even fathom it would be a coincidence and just be a standard run-of-the-mill plane  crash after what's happened.  I think it's a coincidence, my friend.  Well, signs are pointing that way, but I don't know.  I'm still holding judgment.  Because you know something?  There's plenty of airports, there's plenty of planes, and there's plenty of other cities 
[01:17:00]  that could have a goddamn plane crash.  But why the hell does that have to be New York?  By the way, I have to announce our favorite syndicated city.  Yeah?  That would be Boston, Massachusetts.  Why is that?  Because they were the only station that called to make sure you and I and the rest of the  gang on the Opie and Anthony show was okay.  Oh, I'm sure Boston.  I'm still trying to figure out how Boston was responsible for this one.  What happened there?  There's got to be some Boston connection. 
[01:17:30]  The only city that called to make sure you and I were okay.  That's true.  No one else really cared.  We didn't get that call from San Francisco, did we?  No, or Portland.  We didn't get a Portland call.  No one called us from Bigfoot country.  No.  So, but I was talking to Oedipus, and I go, we're kind of relieved down here because it's  looking like it was mechanical failure.  Relieved.  We live in an age where we're now relieved when we find out a complete disaster is a mechanical 
[01:18:00]  failure, most likely, instead of a terrorist attack.  Well, you know something, nothing's been ruled out yet, and I'm still kind of leaning toward,  I think it was mechanical, but I'm not ruling anything out at this time, Opie, until my  investigation proceeds.  They said they found the black box, so they'll be looking at that.  And here's my theory.  Bomb in the goddamn cargo bay.  I don't say that.  But the thing is, that's been a huge issue right now.  They ask you, did you pack your own bags? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Have they been with you?  Yeah.  All right, we'll check them here, put the tagger on it, and there it goes.  Don't say that.  And then they never check if you're on the plane and your bags are on the plane.  They don't even do that.  There's no way they could check.  So I'm thinking cargo door gets blown off.  Where does that go?  Right into the old engine.  Boom.  I don't know.  I'm saying mechanical.  Who am I?  I'm saying mechanical failure and caused by a flock of seagulls. 
[01:19:00]  You think it was the band?  The band.  Should they be held responsible for this?  And I run.  It was a flock of seagulls, my friend.  They say they have problems at Kennedy with the birds.  Yeah?  Lots and lots of birds around Kennedy Airport.  They get sucked into the engine there.  Well, you know something?  I think that the pilots are trained for stuff like that.  That's just a ridiculous regular engine failure.  You know what I mean? 
[01:19:30]  It doesn't blow the engine off of your wing for the most part.  I don't know.  And then when you're taking off, you can't lose an engine like that.  Let me tell you.  They said it went straight down, so it didn't even do as much damage as it could have.  Let me tell you something, man.  I think just about every person that listens to the show has flown out of Kennedy Airport.  Yeah.  The plane was only in the air for three minutes.  We've all seen that stretch of land where it hit.  Oh, yeah.  That little peninsula there.  Oh, when you're coming in.  The Rockaways.  Right.  Sure.  And believe me, for the first two minutes, 50 seconds, everything was fine. 
[01:20:00]  That was a very short trip down.  And why?  You know, enough already.  Did you see all?  Here's another thing.  No God.  Wake up, people.  There's no God.  How many New Yorkers have you seen on the news and everywhere else huddled together in mass prayer for our fair city?  How many times do you see this? 
[01:20:30]  How many clergymen have you seen at Ground Zero and at schools and with politicians talking about prayer and how we're stronger than ever and God will pay?  All that prayer.  What did it get us?  Another aircraft full of fuel dropped on a town.  There's no God.  There's no God.  I'm just a man.  I'm just a man like you.  Caddyshack reference is always nice.  You hear the F-15s?  Yeah.  That's something. 
[01:21:00]  Boy, them things screaming.  F-15s are circling over Manhattan again.  What the hell happened?  What did I miss?  You know, we got the front row seats to Armageddon.  You could live through life.  You could sit back and live through life during a very boring period of time on this planet.  I'm sure hundreds of years have gone by in certain places on this globe where nothing happened.  If you're going to live, this is a good time to live.  Welcome to the end of the world.  We're all here to see it. 
[01:21:30]  And this show is here to get you through it.  We'll get you through it.  We're your Armageddon show.  You could have lived in the wild, wild west where the craziest thing that happened in your lifetime was, you know, an Indian tribe almost attacked your village.  The Injuns got you.  Almost.  Almost attacked your town.  It was the town over, but they came close.  This is just insane now.  It's really good.  And planes falling out of the sky.  Great.  Where's Earl?  Earl had a vision?  Earl, get a mic.  Earl had a vision.  I had a nightmare. 
[01:22:00]  You had a nightmare?  Yes.  All right.  Earl had a nightmare.  What was your nightmare, Black Earl?  That I was walking, driving down the Van Wick, and I'm looking up, and the plane is going overhead.  Van Wick?  And it explodes.  Really?  Yeah.  You had that when?  Last night.  Oh, my God.  Call Kreskin.  My goodness.  I did that because I'm a black girl from the future, and what I did was I transported myself in the DeLorean. 
[01:22:30]  I went to the future, and let me tell you something.  I saw the plane crash.  Then I came back, but I was going to warn people, but I fell asleep.  I was tired from working on the public file all day.  So now I've got to go back in the time machine tonight, go back to two days ago, see the plane crash again in my vision, and then warn people.  I hope I don't get stuck.  I hope I don't get stuck doing something like a public file or a sticker stop. 
[01:23:00]  I need some energy for my time machine, my DeLorean.  There I was, speeding down the Van Wick in my DeLorean.  I reached 88 miles per hour, and I went into the past.  I ended up at the enchantment under the sea ball when I looked up, and I saw a plane crash into the clock tower at exactly 10 o'clock.  I had to get my peppy and my mammy together, or I wouldn't be born. 
[01:23:30]  I saw it disappearing, and then I played the guitar like Chuck Berry, and I saw the plane crash.  And Biff was trying to get my mammy.  So I told my peppy, you punch Biff in the face, and everything will be fine.  I'll be able to go back to the future and tell people about the plane crash, because I saw the whole goddamn thing.  But then when I got back to the future, I went home, and I was going to call up, I swear, I was going to call up American Airlines and tell them, 
[01:24:00]  don't take off the plane, because I saw the plane crash.  But I was laid down for two seconds.  I fell asleep, because I was working on the public file.  I don't know what that is, but I was working on it.  And then I went out to the garage.  I had a brand-new Toyota 4x4 and a girl that looked real 80s.  And my mammy and peppy were older, but they were different.  And all of a sudden, they were cool.  My peppy was an author, and my mammy was a great mom. 
[01:24:30]  And the mayor of our town was a white guy that used to work at the diner.  And Biff was out picking cotton in our yard.  That's called revenge.  You know, people died in the plane crash because I fell asleep, but some good things happen to black earth in the future.  So screw them.  But I'll try it again tomorrow.  Maybe I'll go to the Old West. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, the Old West.  Black girl, that should have helped us out.  So Earl had a vision.  Black girl, call me now for your free reading.  I'm going to go on...  Call me now for your tarot card reading.  I'm going to go on record and say that Earl's the only one that has had a nightmare about planes crashing in the last two months.  Yeah, right?  A bit more than one.  Maybe everyone has had a nightmare at some point in the past two months about a plane crash.  Holy S. 
[01:25:30]  Doc Brown's checking in from Hill Valley.  Yeah.  He goes, how spooky.  10.04.  Anthony woke up this morning.  10.04.  Lightning hit the clock tower.  Did it really?  Oh my God, that's right.  Is that true?  I guess so.  That's a movie plot.  Anthony, you have to go back to the future.  Oh no, black girl's meeting his pappy.  Pete, what do you have, bro?  You had a nightmare too?  Oh my God. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, and I couldn't believe that girl.  I had a nightmare.  Yeah.  I woke up, I looked in the mirror, and I'm black.  Oh my God.  Oh wait, come on.  That's not nice.  That's not nice.  Earl, I apologize personally for that for you.  Yes, Earl.  How did I know he was going to say something like that?  I got to go back to the future because Biff has stole the sports book.  And now he's changed my community forever.  Where the flux capacitor? 
[01:26:30]  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  And just to back up on your back to the future point.  Yeah?  November 5th was the day he went back to 1955, and then, of course, the doc bagged his head  on the toilet, came up with the flux capacitor.  But a week later was the day of the clock tower striking, which is November 12th.  No way.  No way.  Stop.  I swear.  Just stop.  Remember, next week, we're sending you back to the future.  Back to the future.  Wait a minute.  I'm looking at all kinds of back to the future sites, and all I can see is the date Marty 
[01:27:00]  travels back in time to, November 5th.  Okay.  Yeah, and then a week later.  And then a week later.  He stays a week.  Crazy, huh?  He stayed a week.  Because he had to stay for the dance.  You guys suck.  Take care.  Why is there a strange back to the future tie-in with my life here this morning? 
[01:27:30]  The 1004 thing is right, too?  1004 was, yes.  I looked at that.  It was 1004.  Your alarm clock went off at 1004 in the hotel.  1004.  And that's when you heard the traffic reporter saying something.  Yes.  Before your girlfriend shut off the alarm clock, and then you turned on the TV to see this  disaster.  And I knew none of this until after I went off on the Earl back to the future tie-in.  Oh, man.  Thank you for that.  Yeah.  And then people are saying, I heard this on the news, too. 
[01:28:00]  Thank God there's churches and schools in the area, and thank God they weren't hit.  It's a holiday.  They're empty.  Wouldn't it be better if it got hit in an empty building instead of houses with people  in them?  Thank God.  Thank God it didn't hit the church.  The plane took out a few houses.  What about those people?  I know.  And then they look for survivors, which is just...  What about the guy filling up his tank and all of a sudden the jet engine just kind of  rolls up next to your SUV? 
[01:28:30]  You have to move that.  You have to move that.  I cannot pump gas with that here.  Some topiagi probably went out and put a gas pump into it.  How much?  Cash or credit?  Yes, my friend.  That is strange car.  Are you Earl?  What is this?  Time machine?  Earl Stradamus.  Here's my quatrain. 
[01:29:00]  I have another quatrain.  I see a plane crash.  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, Earl had a nightmare last night that...  Earl had exploded over the Van Wick Expressway.  Like, in the past two months, we haven't seen so many visions of disastrous plane crashes  that maybe they get in your dreams.  Earl!  Earl!  You got to shining!  Me and my grandma had to shine.  We'd carry on whole conversations without talking. 
[01:29:30]  You got to shining!  I'm going to come to the Overlook Hotel.  Tell your pappy not to hit me with an axe.  Red rum.  Go F yourself.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  The growing trend of street vendors selling pictures of the World Trade Center growing on the streets. 
[01:30:00]  I would like to tell you how I feel about this, but I don't believe I can do it in socially acceptable terms.  So, I'm just going to say what I feel now.  Any sand...ers that decide they want to sell pictures of the World Trade Center after thousands perished 
[01:30:30]  should have their...ing heads caved in with Tom Brokaw's fist.  I see any of these...ers out there.  I don't care if you're a...ink...  or a...er.  What other derogatory terms can I use?  Oh, give me a pen. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I don't care what you are.  A goddamn, uh...  Oook.  You can say that.  Not me.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, because I...  I...I can't say a socially unacceptable thing about these people.  I can call the female ones...  And the men... 
[01:31:30]  Suck...ers.  You're a little upset that they're taking advantage of the tragedy.  I can't believe, as I walk the streets to NBC Nightly News every night,  that goes on at, what, 11 o'clock...  11-ish on your chronograph,  that I have to pass by people...  Explore...  Explore...  Explore...  Explore...  Taking great advantage of the people that have perished. 
[01:32:00]  These...ing people...  Are nothing but...  In...  And...  Suck...ers.  What?  And...  Holes.  I'd like to jam my...  So far up there...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop.  No, that was shoe.  That was bleeped.  I don't know how that...  Tom, I gotta tell you, you seem extra drowsy today.  You alright? 
[01:32:30]  I'm a little woozy from the Cipro I'm taking.  That's part of the side effects.  I read Dan Rather decided not to take any medication or be tested for anthrax  because he is not caving in to the terrorists by changing his way of life.  I jumped the gun and took the Cipro and got tested for anthrax.  Now Tom Brokaw looks like a f***ing pussy by being medicated.  Well, I just want to go on record now and saying Dan Rather is a f***ing homo. 
[01:33:00]  And I am going to start mainlining HIV, infected blood, from the f***ing suckers down in the village.  That's what I'm doing.  So take that Dan Rather.  You're just not taking Cipro being tested.  I'm going to drink from the f***ing...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Of all the gay men, I'm actually going to let them f***ing be right in the... 
[01:33:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes, I am.  Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.  Yeah?  Cut it out.  I can't bleep fast enough here.  Tom Brokaw is going to allow 15 gay gentlemen to pull their f*** out.  No, no.  Grease them up and stick them so far in Tom Brokaw's f***.  I'm not going to be able to...  Take that Dan Rather.  And you're doing this because Dan's getting more viewers?  It is shown that the ratings go up for us anchors if there's some imminent danger of some health problem developing. 
[01:34:00]  A lot of people checking out Dan Rather because, you know, he's not going to take the Cipro.  He may have the anthrax and they're going to watch every night to see if anything starts growing on him.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da.  I'm going to get a heroin-addicted Haitian bitch and have her f*** on my face.  No, no, no, no.  You can't say that.  She...  I am going to get a heroin-addicted Haitian with the hiv. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  I am going to run a cheese grater over my gums and stick my f*** so far up her f***.  No, no, Tom, Tom.  There's going to be blood and f*** juice flowing down my mouth.  Yes, I said f*** juice.  No, no.  That is the juice from the f***.  Tom, Tom, calm the F*** down, man. 
[01:35:00]  Tom Brugger, MVC Night Lane here.  Tom, Tom.  Don't make me come over that console and f*** you and me.  No, no, that's okay, Tom.  I'm infected and I don't care.  Why'd you go into the...  We're here.  Why'd you go into the closet?  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  MVC Nightly News.  Mr. Sin.  Dan Rather can go f*** himself.  Me.  Tom Broca.  NBC Nightly News is going to run 15 grit sandpaper over my... 
[01:35:30]  And then...  The living...  Out of...  No, no, no, no, no.  And then I'm going to...  No, no, no, no.  Until my...  Spews...  All over...  And then...  I won't even loop up her...  When I...  With my...  Tom Broca, MVC Nightly News.  Look, I have a shanker on my lip already. 
[01:36:00]  I see that.  I am having so much sexual activity unprotected.  Please tune in as I give you a blow-by-blow...  Oh, wait.  A f*** by f*** description.  I don't know if I can say it in that context.  A f*** by description of my...  That I'm having with all kinds of gay men and heroin-addicted women using dirty needles.  Ah, f*** it.  Dan Rather.  F***ing pussy. 
[01:36:30]  Lots of jealousy, Tom.  It's not jealousy.  Lots of jealousy.  I was the first one to have the anthrax problem.  And everyone was ripping you out.  So people tuned in.  I showed them the ship row.  Right.  I showed them that I was being tested.  Right.  And then Dan Rather has to one-up me by deciding, oh, I'm not taking it.  Right.  And where are those pictures I was supposed to see?  Dan Rather.  Goddamn Dan Rather.  Tony!  Yo!  What's up, Tony?  Hey, what's up?  Listen, I don't know if you noticed this, but right when he's talking about how he had 
[01:37:00]  a bad time sitting down after everything had happened and he's poured himself a glass of scotch...  A big water glass full of scotch.  If you listen to it, right before he says scotch, it sounds like he wants to say liquor.  Listen to it.  Listen to it.  Because it's...  Now you're going to have to listen.  I sat down and gave myself a big glass of scotch.  Scotch.  At 9...  9.15.  Yeah.  So I didn't know if you guys ever caught that or if you pointed out, but that's again, 
[01:37:30]  he can't say...  So I can't say liquor, but bring your girlfriend over here.  I'll show how I liquor her.  Thanks, Tony.  Hey, thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Keep up the good work.  All right.  And we got the clip.  All right.  Let's listen if he's trying to say liquor and then he goes to scotch.  All right.  Adrenaline is a very strong drug.  I've...  You know, I was pumped up and I would go home and sleep very little and wake up.  How do you even get to sleep if you're obviously that pumped up?  Well, the first night I went home, I came on the air at 9...  About 9.15 in the morning with Katie and Matt on the Today Show and then just stayed on 
[01:38:00]  until about 2 in the morning, went home.  And, you know, it's fair to say that I was wired, so I thought the way to deal with  this is with a big water glass full of scotch.  And...  This is a good message for the young people out there.  Yeah.  A big glass of scotch.  I hear Dan Rather drinks a daiquiri, that f***ing pussy.  He's a faggot.  No, you don't know that. 
[01:38:30]  This just in Tom Brokaw.  Tom, you don't know that.  NBC Nightly News.  Dan Rather faggot.  No, you don't know that.  Join me at 11 o...  11 on the time device.  Tom, you don't know that.  Oh, no, I know.  I f***ed him last night.  He's got the old Dan Rather yam bags hanging like click clacks.  Remember click clacks?  They hang down like that.  Do your f*** hang low?  Do they wobble to and fro? 
[01:39:00]  Can you tie them in a knot?  Can you tie them in a bow?  Are they the biggest Dan Rathers?  That f***ing fag.  Do your f*** hang low?  His f*** tastes like a dirty penny.  Let's just end.  Dan Rather's f***.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no.  No, slow down.  I meant the...  Well, yes, I did mean the f***.  Okay, all right.  Okay, sorry.  I said I had a hard time describing this in socially acceptable f***ing terms. 
[01:39:30]  Come on, I have anthrax.  Please cut me some f***.  Slack.  Slack here.  Tumblr got NBC Nightly News.  Dan Rather likes a good f***ing.  Which will come sooner?  The end of this bit or like rashes on Dan Rather's face?  He's got the shankers.  I actually like taking a... 
[01:40:00]  You ever see the small kitchen device used to skin carrots?  Yeah.  It's called a carrot peeler.  Peeler.  Peeler.  Sure.  I like taking one of those, jamming it in my...  And twisting it around in a circle so as to break a lot of blood vessels right there.  So blood is pouring out my...  Right?  You get me?  And then I let Haitians, peelers I call them, Haitian peelers, with all cheesy gunk and whatnot, and I'm sure disease, just slam it so far in that bloody f*** that I scream, quite frankly, in pain. 
[01:40:30]  But I know that I will get diseases Dan Rather has no chance of contracting and get the ratings I need to beat that f*** f***.  Dan Rather, a peeler.  Listen to NBC Nightly News.  Tom.  Dan's a peeler.  I'm trying to save you from a lawsuit.  You do not know that Dan Rather's a peeler.  I cranked out a batch on Dan's back last night.  It looked like a map of the Philippines. 
[01:41:00]  Hey, I didn't have to f***ing bleep one word.  Tom Broker, NBC Nightly News.  James, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I work in a bio-level 3 facility at an Ivy League school down here at Harvard.  Yeah.  And it's hard not to get infected when I'm working with the TB because you guys are so damn funny.  Wait, you're on the TB. 
[01:41:30]  You got a gas mask on?  Are you listening to us?  No, no.  I'm coming home from work.  But, yeah, I wear a mask and, you know, I got to laugh and stuff.  It's hard.  All right.  Hard laughing with a gas mask.  Try laughing with anthrax or with Dan Rather's f*** in your f***.  Try that, sonny boy.  Harvard.  Don't the girls take the f*** truck to Harvard?  Isn't that what happens up in Boston?  And they like having sex in the f*** because it keeps their inversions. 
[01:42:00]  They take the bus from Wellesley.  You're right.  The bus from Wellesley College up in Boston.  Yeah.  And they call it the f*** truck.  It's the f*** truck.  I know.  I drank a tall glass of scotch and chased it with Dan Rather's f***.  Mmm.  Mmm, because it tastes good?  That's what I said.  Oh.  Mmm.  Is f***. 
[01:42:30]  Okay.  Mmm.  Good.  That's what a camel's soup is.  And Dan's f*** is mmm.  Good.  I'm Brooke on NBC Nightly News.  Okay.  You ever do that thing with the straw?  Dan loves that one.  I go.  Allegedly.  I pump out a f***.  And then I insert the straw and suck it right out of f***.  That's right.  Out of f***.  You heard it. 
[01:43:00]  F***.  Let me say it one more time.  F***.  F***.  F***.  We sure know how to drive a f***ing bit into the ground.  We sure do.  Tom Brokaw.  We sure do.  NBC Nightly News.  Can't wait to get, get in that f*** of Peter Jennings.  He's got manly abs, doesn't he, Peter Jennings?  I don't care what disease I get, as long as it's better than Dan Rather's disease. 
[01:43:30]  Hey, Bill O'Reilly, bend over.  I'm driving home tonight.  Tom Brokaw, NBC.  Let's get you out of here.  Nightly.  You.  Sucking.  Son of a.  Fat.  Egg.  I'm a.  I should.  Sh.  No.  Good night. 
[01:44:00]  That one was way too close.  You can't do the after the.  Sure you can.  No, you can't.  It's a cacta.  Oh, my God.  You can't do that.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  You, Ben.  The award-winning Opie and Anthony show.  This has got to be a joke, people. 
[01:44:30]  Geeky, geeky, geeky.  I want minorities.  Not enough minorities on my show.  Who wants to be a millionaire?  It's all white guy.  Gelman, bring me some spear chuckers.  Come on.  You can't say that, Regis.  It says in the paper today, can anybody explain this to me, Regis asked, why is it that nearly 
[01:45:00]  all our contestants are white men?  I'm a white man.  So you know I have nothing against them.  But come on.  We would really like a little more diversity here.  Diversity.  Where are the mau mouths?  For the love of God, Gelman.  Get me some spooks.  They've had over 100 contestants so far.  There has not been one African-American playing for the money in the hot seat.  Really?  We've had one Hispanic and just 11 women.  Regis says, here's the challenge. 
[01:45:30]  He said, everyone out there who has thought about being on the show, who isn't a white male,  dial that 1-800 number and let's get into the game.  Come on.  What's the worst thing that could happen to you?  You might become a millionaire.  You have a problem with that?  I don't think so.  Bring on the chinks.  Gelman, Kathy Lee, get me some chinks.  Where are the wetbacks?  They make their way across the border.  Make your way to the hot seat.  You could win a million.  I want homos, Gelman. 
[01:46:00]  Where are the slopes?  Come on.  You can't say that.  I want gooks.  Gooks and spokes, call.  Call Regis.  Oh, my God.  So, Regis, look at the force of minorities on.  Who wants to be a millionaire?  Is that your final answer, you spade?  I can't believe it, Gelman. 
[01:46:30]  He wants minorities, I guess.  Yes.  I want minorities.  Yes, he does.  Where are the dot heads?  Get out of your 7-Elevens and into the hot seat.  I want hymies, gooks, chinks, spades, spear chuckers.  Bring them all.  Eskimos, homos, Mexicans, wetbacks, I don't care.  Get me something other than whitey in the hot seat, Gelman. 
[01:47:00]  Where are the homos, the lesbos, the slopes?  I want a dyke, Gelman.  Bring on the kid touches.  Yes.  Hey, Vinny.  Hey, fellas, what's up?  What's up, Vinny?  Listen, that's what I'm talking about.  What's going on with this country?  Oh, my God, not Vinny.  Come on.  Hey, let me just say something. 
[01:47:30]  You got the number one show on TV,  so let's bring some black people on the show to make it better.  That's like saying, hey, I live in a really nice neighborhood.  I got an idea.  Let's get some black folk to move in.  I mean, come on.  What's going on here?  Oh, Vinny, you're very funny, man.  You know, they tried to.  You're wrong, but you're funny.  Huh?  They tried this once before on that show, Jeremy.  Yeah.  That lady, Maya Angelou, was complaining  because they didn't have enough black contestants.  They found out that black people were trying to get on the show,  but they weren't passing the test. 
[01:48:00]  That was the only problem.  I don't care.  We'll lower the standards.  I need spear checking.  Yeah.  That's all he needs.  It's the number one show.  Let's get some blacks on it.  I don't think they're better.  Why?  Gelman, Gelman, where are my black horns?  I'm putting out a plea.  Jigaboos, Jigaboos, where are you?  Come on.  I need minorities.  We're just looking for minorities for who wants to be a millionaire.  There.  Where are the towel heads?  Get out of your cabs and into the hot seat. 
[01:48:30]  Gelman, I need slopes.  Where are the nips?  You sat your ass in those zeros when you bombed Pearl Harbor.  Sit your ass in the hot seat.  Maybe we should rename the show, Who Wants Food Stance?  Oh, my God.  Come on, Gelman.  Get me some donkeys.  That's just wrong.  Just why do they have to kiss black ass constantly?  What is the point? 
[01:49:00]  I'll kiss him.  Just put him in the hot seat.  Regis, why?  Why are you going to do it?  I don't understand.  We've got all the whites watching.  We need higher ratings.  I need some colored.  You know, you have a guy at Thanksgiving.  Are you listening, Vinny?  Yeah, I'm here.  At Thanksgiving, you eat breast meat all the time.  Occasionally, you want some dark meat.  That's where Regis stands.  I look at that Kathy Lee white bread all day.  I need black holes.  Aborigines.  I don't care. 
[01:49:30]  Come on, into the hot seat.  Who wants to be a millionaire?  The darker, the better.  You want the minorities on who wants to be a millionaire, right?  Arabs.  Retards.  I don't care.  I want a mongoloid.  Preferably a jiggaboo mongoloid.  All right, listen, Regis.  I've got to cut you off because Jay Moore is on the line.  Jay Moore?  Yeah.  Let's check in with Jay Moore.  Jay.  Hey, if you want minorities on the show, put on the half-breed. 
[01:50:00]  He's two minorities.  Put the rock on me.  A big fat Samoan with man boobs.  The guy will eat the chair he's sitting on.  Fuck the rock, gentlemen.  Come on.  Fuck me, the rock.  Who wants food stamps?  Show me your green card.  Ah, he hung up again.  Where'd he go?  His phone's crapping out.  Because he's going through the tunnels down there in D.C.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Regis, we've got to take a break. 
[01:50:30]  Jay Moore's in D.C.?  Yeah.  Tell him to come back with some blacks.  They're running around rampant down there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Talking about steel reserve high-gravity lager.  Well, there's a problem.  In the community.  As Reverend Al so eloquently puts it.  That this steel reserve high-gravity lager.  The ads are racist. 
[01:51:00]  They show two tortoises having sex.  And that's racist?  And it says research shows sex sells.  Well, I guess it's racist putting such distasteful ads in only certain neighborhoods.  Because they were saying you don't see these ads on Park Avenue.  It's all about supply and demand.  Yeah.  And I guess there's a demand for this stuff in the community.  All right, so this is the beer everyone's talking about.  The high-gravity steel reserve.  Can I have one?  No, it's funny.  Remember when I said earlier in the show? 
[01:51:30]  I said, is Budweiser available in some of the communities that only handle steel reserve?  Like Harlem.  And somebody said, yeah, but it's an import.  It's only available as an import.  All right.  All right, here we go.  Let me crack open.  Wait.  Oh.  With a fine twist off top.  8.1 proof.  Whoa!  No, it's got 8.1% alcohol.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  First of all. 
[01:52:00]  Full fluid ounces.  Nice and cold.  Wait a minute.  First of all, this color is a little off.  Doesn't it look like a urine specimen?  Oh, wait a minute.  I seem to have given you the wrong jar.  I've been watching some In Living Color.  All right.  High gravity steel reserve.  Let's take a swig.  Wow.  That's disgusting.  Woo!  Goddamn!  Where Goddamn?  Now, that's good stuff.  All of a sudden, you start talking black when you drink this. 
[01:52:30]  No, wait a minute.  Hey, this stuff is potent.  Holy smoke.  Ow, man.  What the?  It's strong.  This is strong.  Yeah, it's strong.  It's stronger when it's warm.  Oh, I bet.  I don't like it.  Damn.  Do you like it, Ed?  Uh, it's not awful bad, like Meisterbrow or something.  No.  This is like the other side of the spectrum.  I don't know.  I drink this in the cold on a street corner or something. 
[01:53:00]  Maybe that's why it's got more alcohol in it.  No, I'm serious.  Maybe after you've already had six or so.  But if I was at home and I was enjoying an after-dinner brew, this wouldn't be the one I'd go for.  I am outraged!  Oh, no.  I am outraged!  Reverend Allen.  I am outraged.  What the hell are you doing in the studio?  I see you drinking the Steel Reserve high-gravity lager.  Well, we want to try it.  There's a lot of controversy about this stuff, so. 
[01:53:30]  This is a plot, a conspiracy by the white man.  Why is that?  8.1% alcohol.  Yeah.  Well, obviously, they want the homeless to drink this, so when they die on the streets,  they're already embalmed.  You got an extra bottle.  Hey, this stuff's pretty good.  You can have mine.  All right.  Wow.  Steel Reserve.  No, that's just not happening for me at all.  Hey, leave the music on. 
[01:54:00]  It's kind of a soundtrack.  I like it.  All right.  But Doug has brought us something else here, too, to try out.  Oh, yeah.  Steel Reserve.  Boy, I drank two sips, and I'm tanked.  It went right to my head, but.  All right.  What else did you bring?  He brought, wow, a black and tan beer called Howling Monkey.  Oh, come on.  Look at the label.  Where's my, where?  Where's my Howling Monkey?  Dude, look at the label.  Let me see the label.  It's a monkey in a suit. 
[01:54:30]  It is.  It's Planet of the Gate.  My God.  The label is adorned with the image of Dr. Zaius.  Damn you.  Damn.  Let me, let me, let me partake in some of this Howling Monkey.  Damn, it's, it's not bad.  My God.  The image of Dr. Zaius staring back at me.  Damn you all to hell.  I can't be drinking Howling Monkey.  But I'm strangely drawn to it. 
[01:55:00]  Drawn to the Howling Monkey as I was drawn to Zeri, lovely Zira.  Cornelius never knows.  He will never know what happened between me and Zira.  We drank a case of Howling Monkey.  And then I turned her into a Howling Monkey.  Yes.  I dropped my loincloth.  She saw the man with no hair on his body. 
[01:55:30]  I gave her some of Jarton's meat.  Yes, I partook in monkey meat while drinking.  Howling Monkey!  Damn me to hell!  I like the Howling Monkey.  Well, is it better than the Steel Reserve?  What's the alcohol content on me?  Shut this music, give me Reverend Owls, and I'll go back to the Steel Reserve.  All right.  We need a little more Steel Reserve. 
[01:56:00]  Wait a minute.  Give me that to me.  All right.  All right, here's Steel Reserve.  Ah.  Yep, yep.  Steel Reserve, definitely stronger.  It's got a stronger taste to it.  Wow, that's gross.  The Howling Monkey.  The Howling Monkey, you don't like it?  You don't like the Howling Monkey?  No.  That's a better one.  Now, is this sold in the black communities, too?  Is this in the community?  This was around here.  We could get this around here. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, it is?  I saw some stories.  All right.  Damn.  I don't know.  I don't like it.  Well, the Steel Reserve will get you, uh, snotted.  I don't really do that much.  I'll give you that.  Let me tell you, if I was impoverished and had a lot of problems and had to worry about  crime and, uh, shootings in my community and raising my children and sending them to  a school where they, uh, might be shot or stabbed, I would drink the Steel Reserve.  I think that's an endorsement for the Steel Reserve. 
[01:57:00]  Joe, man, a slide if he's an appalled and drinks out on the job.  Steel Reserve.  It's I.  Monday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony, it's being reported that, yeah, Don West is out. 
[01:57:30]  Opie, uh, I'm floored here.  I got the official announcement.  Don West has left the employment of Shop at Home.  He worked hard for Shop at Home for eight years, made substantial contributions to the 
[01:58:00]  company.  However, it was a mutual decision that he should pursue other opportunities at this point in  his career.  And we wish him well in future endeavors.  He's gone.  Don West from the Home Shopping Network, gone.  You remember the guy, I mean, he's, you shop at home, you turn it on at night and he's  just yelling about, uh, various, uh, baseball cards and sports memorabilia.  The guy who just loses mind.

[02:08:30]  for using racial impotence.  But I got hoes up the air.  I'll miss that guy.  Oh, my God.  He'll pop up somewhere else.  That was funny, Anthony.  All right, this is a song that I think it's going to replace  a certain other song that we know and love, 
[02:09:00]  but I don't get a chance to play it very often.  Oh, the Special Olympics song?  Maybe that's it.  Okay.  I don't know.  So I kind of wrote a different version of that song.  So don't call in and tell me that I'm ripping myself off.  Because I already know it, all right?  This is about a childhood friend named Ed.  Ed, here we go.  Don't touch those buttons, either.  I see you looking at them.  When I was a boy of ten 
[02:09:30]  I had a very best friend  Ed was kind with good intent  But just a little different 
[02:10:00]  Oh, special  And  Mama dropped him on his hand  Now he's not so bright instead  He's a little bit special  Just a little bit special  We'd play tag  And he'd get hurt  I'd play soldier 
[02:10:30]  He'd eat dirt  I liked math and a spelling bee  Ed liked talking to a trio  Oh, special  And  Mama dropped him on his hand  Now she keeps him in the shed  Cause he's a little bit special  A little bit special 
[02:11:00]  I ran track  I ran track  Hung out in malls  Ed ran head first into walls  I had girls  And lots of clothes  Ed had names for all his toes  Oh, special Ed  Mama dropped him on his hand 
[02:11:30]  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread  He's a little bit special  Just a little bit special  One day talking to special Ed  He grabbed a brick and he swung in my head  And as he laughed at me 
[02:12:00]  That's when I knew  Special Ed just made me special too  Now I laugh  As I count bugs  I give strangers great big hugs  Next to me  Next to me  Ed is fine  He's a  A  Einstein 
[02:12:30]  Oh, special Ed and me  Now we're not right in the head  You see  Now we're not so bright  Instead  We're a little bit special  Just a little bit special  That bastard Ed  Made me special  Just a little bit special 
[02:13:00]  All right  There's the stimulus we know and love  There's some redemption  Please forgive me  Oh, peace  And for me  1027  7W  CW  Crawling in my skin  These wounds  They will not go  Fear is how I fall 
[02:13:30]  Confusing all this real  Crawling in my skin  These wounds  They will not go  Fear is how I fall  Confusing  Confusing  What is me  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show 
[02:14:00]  If you're in the New York area  877-692-1027 is our phone number  In the studio  Jim Norton  Adam Farrar  Let's check in with Dallas  Craig, what's up?  What's up, man?  What's up, man?  Y'all was bagging on D-Town yesterday  What's up, man?  What happened?  Y'all was bagging on D-Town yesterday  Talking about y'all will never come to Dallas  Why not, man?  Well, we're on in the middle  Y'all on a tour of a station here  No, we're on in the middle of the night in Dallas 
[02:14:30]  So it's kind of tough to do anything for Dallas  I know  That's the only thing that sucks, man  Because I work at another radio station here in Dallas  And I work in a day time  And I caught you guys one night, man  And I got hooked, man  And I was like  I'm up till 2 in the morning every night  They tried to catch you guys, man  That is so weird that we're on 10P to 2A somewhere  Yeah, because they would rather bring in  See, what happened is  Let me tell you  Just chasing down here  Does anyone else care in America, though  What you're about to say?  No, I'm just asking, seriously 
[02:15:00]  I'm a big Cowboy fan, dude  I'm a big Cowboy fan  And we'll go to Dallas  I think when the Cowboys win two games in a row  Craig, thanks for the support, though  We appreciate that  Hey, man, I love you guys, man  I'm still listening every night  All right, thank you  Until then  Until y'all get a better shot, man  Holla  All right, peace  Yeah  Yeah  All right, we have lots to do  We have a letter from Stalker Patty  Apologizing for her actions  On the show the other day 
[02:15:30]  Apologize  Do you see how lunatic this woman is?  This is what mental patients do  To pull you back in  Yes  They make you feel sorry for them  And then, you know, you realize you're a human being  And then you're like, okay, I'm sorry  And then they're close to you again  I was shaking  And, well, we could read this  It's about a five-page letter  Oh, my God  And in the letter she talks about  There's no punctuation  No, in the letter she talks about being an ant  Which is pretty interesting  Being an ant  You know  No, she thinks she's an insect 
[02:16:00]  Yeah  Well, it was a while back  I believe it was Norton, right?  That said, this woman has the body of an ant  She is  She's very frail and fragile looking  And her body is very ant-like  And we've been goofing on her about that  Now she's acknowledging it in her letter  She's referring to herself as an ant  Yeah, you want to get everyone up to speed  About what happened the other day  Not the whole Patty story  Oh, I know  Because that's a nightmare  Patty's just basically a stalker of this program 
[02:16:30]  Of Opie Morso, thank God  No joking, she really is a stalker  People are like, ha ha, a little radio bit  I hear this stuff on the morning zoo all the time  But what makes her a scary stalker  Is she can lift ten times her body weight  Right, very scary  Right  A stalker doesn't have to be the person  That shows up at your door with a gun  It's preferable  But it doesn't have to be  And Patty is a type of stalker  And we learned stalkers stick together  So there's a stalker in Chicago  Yeah  Who decided to mail Stalker Patty 
[02:17:00]  All my personal info  And I was taking care of it behind the scenes  But Patty decided to tell my girlfriend  And she lost her ass at the Beacon Theater  Which made for a nightmare of a night  So then I lost it on Patty the other day  Not only that though  But Patty at the Beacon Theater  Was all pissed off and upset  That she couldn't get backstage  Meanwhile, it wasn't our gig  It was Jane Moore's  She was complaining to certain people  Like looking at people that were backstage  And going  I saw people I didn't know back there  I've been involved at the show for quite a while 
[02:17:30]  Why?  Why am I being treated like this?  Four fists waving in the air  Two feet planted on the ground  You know, people she doesn't know  Being backstage  And wants to know why they're backstage  Tiny abdomen shaking back and forth  Hanging from that little thread-like thing  Between the thorax and the abdomen  That little hair-like whiskery piece of material  That is just too thin to support life  I never realized how it worked  But on Patty it's just shaking back and forth 
[02:18:00]  Why?  Right, so she was  I have something real quick  She was standing just outside the entrance to the dressing room  And she looked at me and said  They're not letting me go up there  So I said, I don't know Patty  I was standing there with six people that I brought with me  That were members of the union that I worked with  They're very important people  This one guy resembled Keith the cop  He resembles him  Mind you, I mean you look at him  You know it's not Keith the cop  She stood there staring at him going 
[02:18:30]  Keith  Keith  And the guy didn't answer  The guy was like  Who is this  Why isn't Keith  Paying attention  I'm one of those families  She was frightening, man  Loony  Hey, what's this white powder in the envelope?  Oh, don't even  It's probably danger from her pubic hair  Oh!  Worse than anthrax  She addresses the whole  Trying to get backstage at the Jay Moore show  At the Beacon 
[02:19:00]  And other things  We left it with basically making  Salker Patty cry  We're not proud of ourselves  But that's what happened  No, no, cry is too nice a word  For what she was doing  We told her to get lost  She was like bawling, hysterical  Like when you see in the movie  They tell somebody that somebody they love just died  That's how she's crying  And as per Mary  Our intern  She released fluids  On herself  She was so upset  There's no 100% guarantee with that 
[02:19:30]  But she smelled  Very, very funny  She smelled like  Someone that was at the friars club  Right  Like the best diaper  Yeah, exactly  No, because we asked you to  She was so upset  And losing it  That we said  Mary, please bring her to the bathroom  So she could kind of freshen up  And get herself together  She didn't  What did we do?  She didn't do anything  She was upset  And you guys were laughing  So I went and learned  The good of mine would heart  Alright, that's fine  I wasn't sure  Why are you making fun of me? 
[02:20:00]  All it was was the fluid  We used to bond the larvae together  In the chambers till they hatch  It has a urine-like scent to it  That's how we keep the walls up  In our holes  I don't understand  She was shaking  I mean, shaking to the point  Where she couldn't walk  From the bathroom to the studio  Like she was holding on to me  You know, they do that  Just before they attack  Yeah, they shake  They do shake 
[02:20:30]  Yeah  And they come out of everywhere  With those huge mandibles  The joint  And what is that  We're not proud statement  We're not very proud of that  You were very happy with that  I've never seen Opie so pleased  I was just trying to redeem myself  Because the email I got  The next day  Oh, yeah  Usually email doesn't get to me  Some of it was  I should have read some of that  In the air  One of them was from Cindy Williams  She was really big  Yeah  And because of the Patty incident  I shredded my vocal cords  By the way  Yeah  Because of this  Shut up 
[02:21:00]  Literally shredded them  Where I might have to go  To like a throat specialist  That's like Muslim Raid  My voice hurts so much  Every time I talk now  Yeah, that is Muslim Raid  Muslim Raid  Picture the flags burning  They're chanting  All the beards  The filthy animals in the streets  And then they're yelling  Shut up  Yeah  I can see it  There's not a lot of distortion  In that, by the way  That was my voice  Going past what your vocal cords 
[02:21:30]  Are supposed to do  One more time  Let's hear it  Shut up  Okay  So Mary  When she walked Patty  To the bathroom  She came running back in  Saying, hey man  Patty relieved herself  She smells like  You know  Number one  Right  Like she did a number one  On herself while weeping  It's not what Mary said exactly  Mary came back with her hand out  And said, smell my fingers  And who didn't  Usually that's hot  But everyone did  Yeah 
[02:22:00]  Until you realize  Smell my finger  Okay  It was Patty  Alright, well  I will hand over the letter  To Anthony  So he can read it  As Stalker Patty  This is the  Okay  Latest installment of  The soap opera  That is Stalker Patty  Yeah  Just listen for the guilt  Here it is  You're trying to guilt  And this is what  Mental patients do  They give you the guilt  And then you invite them  Back into the  Into the fold  Oh wait  We need some  We need some music 
[02:22:30]  Before you  Before you read the letter  Oh, play  Play that sad  Walking away song  From The Incredible Hope  Owen A and Company  This is in response  To Monday's episode  In the studio  Please cut me a little slack  You're judging me  Kind of harshly  My life has been  Turned upside down  In the span  Of less than a week  And I had to move  An entire room  Into storage 
[02:23:00]  Pack my bags  Leave a place  That was an illegal rental  That I didn't know about  Under an immediate eviction  Finding myself  Suddenly homeless  Overnight  And scrambling  For temporary lodging  Trying to relocate  To a new home  What does that have to do  With anything?  With no money  And continue  There has not been  A period yet  And continuing  To work my two jobs 
[02:23:30]  Without taking  Any time off  You're right  No punctuation  Either  I told you  Oh my god  I'm so lame  They put me  At the bottom  Of the hive  Where I have to  Knore through solid rock  To see the light of day  Now she goes  On top of that  The two crooks  I rented from 
[02:24:00]  For three months  With no lease  Were threatening me  Over the phone  At work  Because they wanted  More money from me  One was a blue odd fog  So  So they're  They're trying to get  More money from her  She'll pay it  Distortion  Is part of this letter  Now  Right  Last night  I found a place  Actually signed a lease  And made arrangements 
[02:24:30]  To tag on  An extra  To the rent  To make up  For a security deposit  First page  I just flipped over  Nothing about anything  But her problems  Finding a place to live  Well that's what they do  Hello man  And now  And now  Some of the stress  I've been carrying  Is beginning to go away  As problems get solved  All this was happening  In the span  In the span of a couple of days  With no mental preparation 
[02:25:00]  Of warning  And not knowing  What was gonna happen next  Plus I was alone  With my situation  Fending for myself  With literal  No help from others  In the colony  With no help from others  In an unforeseen situation  That just  Heaped itself on me  Some of that  Bottled up stress  Expressed itself  On Sunday night 
[02:25:30]  I know I should  Not have gotten  So upset  When I wasn't allowed  Upstairs after the show  I'd been dealing  With a huge situation  All week  And merely wanted  Some company  In a festive atmosphere  That would take me away  From my circumstances  For a couple of minutes  Shut up!  Because I was not a stranger 
[02:26:00]  To some people upstairs  I didn't think it was a problem  To come up and mingle a little  Maybe I needed some people  To be with me at the moment  And felt frustrated  That I could not have  A couple of minutes  To escape my situation  There's the guilt  There's the guilt  She just wanted to come back  Have a little companionship  As for our issues  Concerning the  Correspondence 
[02:26:30]  From Chicago  It was an error  In judgment  On my part  I'd been concerned  About it  Since I handed it in  It was an additional worry  On top of what  I suddenly found myself  Going through  A couple of days  Before  And maybe I  Someone from the show  Could have reassured me  That I was okay  And being handled  I would not have felt  The need to mention it  To the wrong person 
[02:27:00]  By mistake  By mistake  On my part  Sometimes silence  And no feedback  Can increase  My anxiety  And I give me an impression  That it's worse  Than it was  I merely wanted  To know the status 
[02:27:30]  Of the letter  And what happened  With it  I didn't realize  It was not good  To tell Sandy  She was the first  One I saw  And I asked about it  On impulse  As a lot of  Bagages on my mind  That was one concern  I needed to be  Relieved from  I had never 
[02:28:00]  Gotten a letter  Like this before  Can laughter  Always funny  Sorry  Go ahead  And with no  Prior experience  I didn't know  What to think of this  I felt  I needed  To ask  Anyone  Please be fair  To me  I've done nothing  Wrong  That I can see  In a technical way  I've just been reacting 
[02:28:30]  To stressful situations  That have been  Forced on me  Fuck it off  Stuff I didn't ask  For a plan  I admit  My behavior  Wasn't the plan  Be more funny  As for a 
[02:29:00]  Correspondence  From Chicago  Direct anger  To him or her  They may have  Done something  Illegal  Harassment  Be it a letter  Or a phone  Hang up  It's against  The law  She knows that  Who is this  Person  And why did  They do this  To begin with  I'm losing 
[02:29:30]  I'm losing  My fickle teeth  Yeah baby  Yeah  I'm not  Super lady  A wonder woman  Oh my god  Super lady  Has there been  A super lady  No  Excuse me  Has there been  A super lady  No  With a body  Like an ant 
[02:30:00]  Super lady  I'm buffing away  I'm not  Super lady  A wonder woman  I'm anorexic  Bitch  Even with  Six legs  And the physical  Now this is real  This is what  She's writing  Even with  Six legs  And the physical  Strength to lift  Fifty times  My own weight  Or with my  Compound voice  Which I probably  Beats Opie's  2015 vision 
[02:30:30]  I'm still a human  Ant  Who is more  Sensitive than  Most  I do have  Feelings when I  Go through  Circumstances  That a bigger  Than an average  Person goes  Through  Please forgive  Me my  Temporary  Loss of  Sanity  And welcome  Me back  To your  Good graces  And company  Of the show  Thank you  It's the retarded combo 
[02:31:00]  You better watch  The first  The game  Since it  Gets you  I bet  Yeah  Sweet  Merciful crap  That's right  Homer  I gotta be honest  Patty made sense  Yeah  The letter was actually  Fairly coherent  And made sense 
[02:31:30]  In what type of way  Just that  You know  She  Was well written  Yeah  She rambles  On and on  All right  Do you feel  The guilt  In that letter  Though  It's like  Here's all  Of my problems  I don't need  You  Compounding  My problems  By pointing out  My ineptness  And mistakes  Nice girl  But about as  Sharp as a  Sack of wet  Mice  I've had  Several close  Friends  That when they  Start laying  Stuff like that  On you  You get rid 
[02:32:00]  Of them  Bolt  Yeah  But I keep  Coming back  You freaks  Run  Run  Yeah  That's the guilt  Machine  Oh my god  Jesus Patty  Oh wow  The medications  Don't work  So there's the  Latest on the  Patty saga  They can't  Believe it  The letter  Where's the rock  That was tied to  Thrown through the  Window  Oh my god  Let's go to

[02:33:30]  It's Super Lady  Super Lady  Super Lady  Mike what's up  Hey what's going on  Hey  It's pretty impressive  That Anthony knows  All the friggin  Anatomical terminology  To the ant  He's the smartest  Air conditioning repair man  I've ever seen  I ran into a few  Up in the tuck door  Jackass  Ants are pretty impressive  Whether you step in their house  And kick them out  They seem to find a second house  Every time  See Patty is just like an ant  Not only in body  But it seems  Time after time 
[02:34:00]  Her little ant hole  Gets kicked over  By some kid  Or you'd pour some juice  In it or something  Right  And the next day  What do you see  Not her ant hole  They're right back there again  Moving on  Just like Patty will  And she don't think  Of the psychological problems  The ant faces  When you kick that  Nice straight line  They're cracking a cricket  Apart on one end  And the hole's at the other  And her instinct  Is to swarm  Just swarm  That's it  The ant herself  Is calling it  How did she get  The hotline by the way  Patty  Hello  Well you sound

[02:35:00]  Why  Because I wanted  To run up  And show Reynolds  You know what  I was hearing  At the news department  Up at 1010 Winds  I actually  I heard that  Lois Lane  Was falling  With a helicopter  From the roof  And the super lady  Has got to catch her  As she falls  To the straight below  Well anyway  Opie yelled at me  So hard  On Monday  Yes  I didn't even know  It  But I did 
[02:35:30]  What my  I'm out of here  I did  Opie yelled at you  I'm sorry  He was so intimidating  God damn  That is the best thing  But that's how I get  When I'm intimidated  Enough  Is that what it was  If you're loud enough  And threatening enough  Yes I will be  Intimidated enough  Is that what you did  He intimidated you 
[02:36:00]  And yelled at you  And you wound up  Going all over yourself  Well  Yeah I did  I couldn't help  I didn't even know it  Until I left  And came up  Well everyone else knew  Everyone else knew  You must be taking vitamins  Or something  When the ant feels threatened  It secretes a must  You know  You get kind of scary  You really do  Shut up  Wait a minute  I'm getting warmer  In my crotch  By the way Tom  Yes  Norton is on the floor 
[02:36:30]  Rolling around  Norton  You want to get off the floor  Norton's like a skunk man  She tried to spray you  In self defense  That's one of my  Super powers  That super lady has  I'm not super lady  Actually I am super lady  And what I do  One of my defenses  When one of those  Super villains come  Is I wet myself  And the smell  Chases him away  Just because you're  Super lady  You don't have to behave  Like Christopher Reeve  Since the accident  Super lady  Flying away 
[02:37:00]  On her maxi pad  Very funny  You're a mess  How bad do you  Leave yourself  Not that bad  But I did  It was enough  It was enough  Now Patty  Since you didn't have  A place to live  Where did you shower  Well I stayed at  Friends places  Over the last five days  I stayed on  Leave  Super friends  Yeah I had friends  A couple friends  On Staten Island  They let me stay  Over night  And uh  I made my home  In the North Pole 
[02:37:30]  It's a big  Frozen yellow castle  Guess how I make it  I don't know how  Super lady flies  High above the North Pole  And I listen  Opie yell at me  And as I wet myself  It lands on the  Icy mist below  Gigantic yellow ice castle  And the smell  Keeps the villains out  Well anyway  I think I did a  Very good job  For myself  Getting a place  Within three days 
[02:38:00]  And  Shut up dummy  I'm set to move  This Thursday  And if Opie really scares me  I'm gonna put a brown roof  On the whole thing  Super lady  Super lady  Where the hell  Did you get that  Super lady  The emaciated mess  Flying through the air  Girls leaking themselves  Always funny  Cleverly disguised  As a 45 year old virgin  That'll be a good  What did I learn  Girls leaking themselves  Always funny 
[02:38:30]  You know  I think I owe Mary  The intern an apology  I thought she was exaggerating  I'm like  There's no way  Just don't yell at her  The yes it did  And I didn't know it  Until late  Shut up  She just wet herself again  Opie's like her nemesis  It's like kryptonite  Opie's yell  Just makes her  Relieve her function  It's like kryptonite  Wow  Oh no  Like good  Hit with kryptonite  I wish I had that power

[02:39:30]  And level them  With my yellow fluid  Flying on the wings of a maxi  Flying on my big wings of a maxi pad  I fly over the villain  And f*** yourself on them  Can you breathe my mind?  My hymen is like lead  I don't know what kind of Superman tie in that is  But no one's sure it  No one's seeing through it 
[02:40:00]  It's Super lady  Able to open stuffed jar lids with her labia  Super lady  You gotta love it  She is never a disappointment  Super lady stinks  Dude we gotta get her a suit  Literally it's around Christmas time  We gotta get her a suit  For the Philly show  A cape and a diaper  A cape and a diaper  And then Opie can yell at her on stage  And she can wet herself  Price of admission  I thought we were reenacting the carry scene 
[02:40:30]  With the soccer paddy  Oh are we gonna put her in a gown  And dump pig blood on her head  No this is better  After talking it up  Like she's gonna be the queen of the prom  I'll laugh at you  Look at your dirty pillows  They're showing  I don't have any dirty pillows  Alright we gotta get a Supergirl outfit  For Stalker Paddy  My hairy pillows  Shall we  My hairy pillows  That's what they are  Looks like the stuffing's coming out  I better write some  Kier-Respine  To a fishy Kier-Respine  Nice  Alright we have to take a break 
[02:41:00]  The Opie and Anthony show  Man Adam Buckman from the post  Yeah  He needs something  He needs to find something to write about  He did a whole article on the fact that  William Shatner farted during an interview  Yeah I was looking at that  What is it  There's a video out  There's so much going on in the world  And he felt like he had to take up his  His space in the post today  Talking about Captain Kirk farting 
[02:41:30]  There's some video out there  Wait a minute  You just talked about choking a goose  And Captain Kirk farting disgusts you?  No I was writing about it thanks  Oh okay  There's a video out  It's called  The Mind Meld  Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime  And it's William Shatner  And Leonard Nimoy  Sitting around  They're both 70 years old  Waxing poetic about the Star Trek days  Exchanging stories  And apparently 
[02:42:00]  50 minutes into this  William Shatner is asked  About his co-star  Leonard Nimoy  And he just kind of does the one cheek thing  And lets one go  Out of nowhere  He just lets one go  And doesn't miss a beat  And then they just keep going on  But this guy was fascinated by it I guess  Among other highlights  Nimoy reveals how Star Trek 
[02:42:30]  Drove him to drink  And to a shrink  And Shatner  Get this  Discloses that he had no idea  That other cast members  Disliked him so intensely  Both men confess  That the long hours  They worked on Star Trek  Wrecked their marriages  Hey Bill  You weren't on Star Trek  Your whole life  Yeah  I think  What happened to the other ones?  A green lady  Kind of wrecked your marriage  How about a pool  Wrecked one of them  I thought the fart  Was air bubbles from her  My God  I can't believe  My wife fell in the pool 
[02:43:00]  Let me  Jet propel myself to her  Look at me go  I'm  Hitting warp five  At his age  He probably didn't even realize  He did it  That's why  He just kept on going  Security detail  Phasers on stink  We're  Going  Down  I'll get you  You Klingon bastards  Con  Oh that was  Kind of good  I feel like

[02:44:30]  I was  Spock in the hole  I'll show you  Harry Mudd  So yeah  I guess  That made Adam  Buckman  Laugh a little bit  The fact that  He farts  And now people  Will buy it  Just because  He farts  I bet  I gotta see it  I kinda  I was a huge  Fan of the  Old series  So I'll watch
