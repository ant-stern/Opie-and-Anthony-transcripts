<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts complaining about an overly enthusiastic security guard's greetings, seguing into a discussion of the New York Giants' Super Bowl win and Bill Belichick's coaching strategies.  This transitioned into a review of *All in the Family*, specifically Archie Bunker's eulogy for Stretch Cunningham, followed by an unexpectedly detailed critique of a silent film, focusing on its visual storytelling and the lead actress's beauty, and a digression into the hosts' opinions on moles on women’s faces.  The discussion then shifted to the upcoming 3D re-release of *Star Wars*, specifically criticizing George Lucas's choices regarding the release order and Hayden Christensen's casting.  Macaulay Culkin's changed appearance was also discussed, with one host recounting a recent encounter with him and comedian Todd Barry.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a controversy surrounding comedian Tom Green and a similarly named professor, focusing on the professor's complaints about online harassment allegedly from the comedian's fans, with the hosts expressing skepticism towards the claims and criticizing the news coverage.  This was followed by a discussion of CNN commentator Roland Martin's suspension for anti-gay tweets, the subsequent reactions, and the hosts' defense of freedom of speech, mentioning Greg Kelly's expected commentary on the matter.  The segment concluded with more live reads and further discussion of a Shari's Berries advertisement.

The show continued with a segment featuring vulgar and graphic descriptions of a fictional sexual encounter. This was followed by a discussion of a viral video of a father confronting his daughter about her rebellious Facebook posts, which culminated in him shooting her laptop.  The hosts' reactions were varied, ranging from amusement to criticism of the father's methods.  The anniversary of Mike Tyson's rape conviction was mentioned, followed by extensive reviews of Van Halen's debut album and a recent song, along with a review of a Twisted Sister song—all laced with profanity and vulgarity. A news story about a flash mob looting a convenience store concluded this segment, prompting a Black History Month joke.

The next segment delved into a discussion of the perceived laziness and entitlement of younger generations, prompted by a caller's complaints about her teenage son.  Several callers shared similar anecdotes, with the conversation becoming increasingly vulgar and offensive, including racial slurs and misogynistic remarks.  A lengthy analysis of a parking lot altercation video between a Black man and a white man followed, filled with offensive language and racial stereotypes from both the hosts and the co-hosts.  Jim Norton's upcoming Atlanta show was mentioned, and William Shatner appeared as a guest towards the end of this segment.  The conversation with Shatner initially focused on his Broadway show, transitioning into anecdotes about his experiences with horses, including a story about a beloved horse's death, and experiences filming *Alexander the Great*.  He also shared a story about Patrice O'Neal.  The Rock's aversion to radio was briefly discussed.

The final segment largely focused on William Shatner promoting his one-man show, "Shatner's World," providing anecdotes from his life, including a humorous story about a hospital visit, his busy career, his relationship with *Star Trek*, interactions with fans, including President Obama, and experiences with Priceline.com stock and various corporate entities. He mentioned filming a documentary about a Xena convention and a speaking engagement in New Orleans.  He also discussed his past marijuana use, experiences working with Rod Serling and a film writer who died of progeria, and performing in Shakespeare as an understudy. The interview concluded with promotional information for his show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show in the way!  Yeah!  Good morning!  Oh!  Be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be.  Good morning!  Good morning!  Friday morning, good morning!  How about you open the fucking door instead of this good morning?  I got two hands full of shit and I get,  good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning, Friday morning, Friday morning!  Friday morning!  I'm like, how about you fucking get up and open the door  because I have to put all my stuff down 
[00:00:30]  because you're too busy when you're good morning.  Proud of morning.  Proud of morning.  Good morning.  He is OCD, isn't he?  Good morning.  I never knew he said it twice until Danny pointed out.  What does he say?  Good morning, good morning.  Good morning, good morning, good morning.  Good morning.  Yeah, that's the guy up front.  I don't know what he does.  I don't know.  I think he's a security guy.  I'm not sure.  Is he really?  Yeah.  We've seen him for three years.  He's a security guy.  That's what I think.  He sits right outside the elevator, Banks, 
[00:01:00]  and then you've got to get into this place.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's a key card thing.  I got my hands full this morning,  and he's too busy with it.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Well, you're going to love during baseball season  because he always talks about the Yankees after good morning.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's like, how about them Yankees?  Yankee baseball, good morning.  I think he's a big Giants fan, too.  Big blue, good morning.  I think he's very happy the Giants won the Super Bowl.  Giants win, good morning.  Oh, my God.  Is that you, Jimmy? 
[00:01:30]  What, are you already farting?  No.  What's wrong with you?  Who is it, Mars?  No one farted.  Mars, come on.  Oh, Mars.  I smell something.  Man, I smell something bad.  My nose is not good this morning, though.  My nose is really smells all right, man.  It's going to be all right.  It scared me.  Good morning.  There's no smells in here.  Smelly morning.  Smelly morning.  Speaking of the Giants really fast, Belichick wanted the boys to make sure Eli threw to  Manningham.  He was caught on Mike, NFL Films. 
[00:02:00]  Really?  Yeah.  He basically said, make him throw to Manningham.  Oops.  Oops.  Eef.  That's breaking from...  Bad call.  Huh?  It's a bad call, but, you know...  It's not a bad call.  I mean, the coverage was there and everything.  Eli just made an amazing pass.  That is true.  He was covered.  Yeah, it wasn't like he was wide open or anything like that.  He just picked the wrong time to say, hey, make sure he throws to Manningham.  Whoops.  Oopsie.  Can I tell you, I was watching last night, very briefly, because we're doing James Cromwell 
[00:02:30]  later, and he was Stretch Cunningham on All in the Family.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So I was watching some All in the Family clips, and when Archie gives the eulogy for Stretch,  like, Stretch wasn't even in the episode.  Yeah.  It's just...  It's fucking mind-boggling how funny that show is.  Yeah, yeah.  And it annoys me how well-written that was.  And because they had no filters.  Fuck, yeah.  I feel bad for these writers that have to work around the new rules.  There's probably really funny writers out there that aren't being used properly, because,  you know, you might offend someone with your jokes. 
[00:03:00]  He found out Stretch was Jewish.  There you are.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Until he had to read it, and it was just very funny.  I forgot about that episode, yeah.  Is it a long clip?  I don't know.  No, a few minutes, but it was just watching him up there stumble through this brilliantly.  I was like, God damn, he's a funny dude, man.  How old was he when he was Stretch Cunningham on...  He was younger.  I saw a clip.  He was probably, I'm going to guess, 20-something.  Jesus. 
[00:03:30]  Let's take a look at it.  Tell an awful joke.  How he used to look.  This all in the family, by the way, is no I-Rob.  Let's keep it in perspective.  This I-Rob is just setting the fucking sitcom world on fire.  I saw the rest of the movie.  Which one?  The silent movie.  Did he like it?  I really liked it a lot, yeah.  But you didn't like it at first?  I hated it at first.  I've never had a movie turn me around so completely.  I hated it because you were uncomfortable by it because you're like, wait, where are  the words?  Right, I didn't know it was the silent movie.  Even the words coming.  We need words.  I was just telling Ant that he would like the movie, too. 
[00:04:00]  Just someone that likes a lot of films.  Because I was just telling Ant, we're talking about the artists, obviously.  It's a true silent film.  This is how they did it.  They didn't update it for modern day times or whatever, except for that one scene, but  I don't want to give that away.  But besides that, that's how they made films.  Simple as that.  And it was.  You were right.  It was shot amazing.  There's a scene when the camera is showing an old studio with a bunch of staircases in 
[00:04:30]  it and people are hustling and bustling.  Holy fuck, is it a work of art to watch that?  Yeah.  Everyone had to do their part perfectly.  I'm sure somebody fucked up when they had to start over.  I think you'll like it, Ant.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was telling Ant, though, like...  I definitely want to see it.  They rarely went for the words where you had to read something.  Right.  And there were complete scenes where they never went to the words, but you knew exactly  the conversation that was being had because of the acting and stuff.  And it had something...  The facial expressions and all that and how they moved their bodies. 
[00:05:00]  And also, I noticed whoever did the set had to tell you so much through the set design.  Wow.  Like, there's one...  If you know it's a silent movie, you're going to go with a totally different mindset than  I did.  Like, there's one scene where, you know, the actor is a drunk and he's kind of a destitute.  And the way they have to show you that without him saying it is, you know, the way they have  to show the apartment and they have to show him being destitute by dressing the set.  And they have to show that he's been drinking because when he throws his one bottle in, there's 
[00:05:30]  many bottles.  It's all these little things they have to do because they have no way of doing it otherwise.  That was such a big part of it was the set dressing and...  That's what I mean.  Fuck, they could tell a story like that.  It seems like they went back in time and said, this is how they used to do films.  It was great, man.  Mary Pickford, America's sweetheart.  Yeah.  Dude, how beautiful is that?  The lead, the woman who...  I always thought women in the 1920s sucked, but watching this woman, you're like, oh, that's  why they were in love with movie stars back then.  She was fucking beautiful.  Glamorous.  Oh, amazing.  But she's more beautiful in the pictures we were looking at yesterday online. 
[00:06:00]  She looked like you're better in the movie.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I hate that mole shit.  I fucking hate moles on girls' faces.  There could be a couple of places where it might not be as bad as others.  We were talking about that.  If it's too close to the lips, it gets weird.  It drives me nuts.  I've always hated that.  And some girls will access it and make it darker.  I just feel like it's a speck of duty or something. 
[00:06:30]  Or cancer.  Something.  I'm just like, get rid of that.  I had moles in my face.  I got that shit chopped off.  They're not sexy.  No.  Every once in a while, you find one and they have a hair or two growing up.  Why wouldn't you at least clip the hairs?  Good mom.  Why wouldn't you shave the hairs off the moles?  Yeah, yeah.  Give it a little clippage.  Something.  Cuticle scissors.  You should check out the artist's hat.  I will.  I will.  I said yesterday, and I probably shouldn't say this because they've been really good  to us. 
[00:07:00]  I like the movie a lot, but I don't know how the masses come out and see a movie like that.  I think they're going to be uncomfortable in general.  I don't think they expect it, to tell you the truth.  I really, I honestly.  It's up for a million awards, though.  I don't know how they could expect you to come out and see it in a movie theater like  the masses, because the masses are generally stupid.  Yeah, I know Cindy Crawford has a mole asshole.  Yeah, and it's not attractive on her.  Even when she was young, that mole always bothered me. 
[00:07:30]  You don't think they're going to come out?  No, I don't think they would.  I think it's, you know, people are more apt to go see Paul Blart mall cop than they  are to see fucking Asylum Movie and appreciate the artistic value of it.  Oh, it's well done.  It really is.  But, I mean, it's up for, it's going to win a whole bunch of awards.  Oh, yeah, award-wise, it'll be huge, but as far as people really just flocking to see  it, I don't know.  I'd rather see 3D Star Wars again. 
[00:08:00]  See Star Wars again.  Is that coming out this weekend?  Tonight, I guess.  Again.  Boy, that fucking Lucas.  All right, already.  You know, and people were saying that years ago.  After, like, the first three, they were going, wow, this guy's got nothing else.  And then he makes three more, and then now 3D.  It's kind of smart.  Well, you know what?  He's just following the technology.  If you could fucking milk a franchise like he has.  What would I say?  George Lucas.  Good morning.  Good morning, George. 
[00:08:30]  Good morning.  With the artist being popular?  Star Wars?  Silent Phil.  Silent Star Wars.  Silent Star Wars.  That'd be good.  How do we get to a note to George Lucas?  Looks like Buck Rogers in the 25th century.  Throw that shit in black and white, and fucking do a silent movie next.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's enraging how he just won't stop with it.  He just won't stop.  He won't stop.  But the technology's there.  How do you not, knowing the 3D thing is taking off, and there you are with this movie,  knowing it would look pretty cool in 3D.  You gotta go there. 
[00:09:00]  But will it?  Like, what the fuck?  Like, I don't know.  It wasn't made for 3D.  But that doesn't matter as much anymore.  I know.  Yeah.  It's more of the depth of the...  Plus, because he used those models, it might look fucking really cool in 3D.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  A lot of CGI.  Yeah.  Because he wasn't using that flat shit.  They were actual models.  So they might look really cool in 3D.  I don't know.  It just seems to me like...  First of all, why did he start with Phantom Menace? 
[00:09:30]  Why did he start with Phantom Menace?  Because that's the first movie in the series.  Well, chronologically.  But New Hope is the first movie that we saw.  But I don't think New Hope would be as effective in 3D.  Oh, so they're not even going with the original.  They're going with Phantom Menace with Jar Jar fucking Binks.  Oh, then I completely agree with you.  Yeah, it's like...  How cool would it be to see the original Star Wars in 3D?  So what?  We have to wait?  The original would be cool with the fucking trench scene on the Death Star. 
[00:10:00]  Well, that's what I meant, because they used models back then.  So I'm thinking 3D technology would pick up on that, and that would look probably really cool.  I didn't realize they were doing Phantom first.  Yeah, now it's Phantom Menace.  Oh, you're right.  You think he's saving the big one for last?  Or the technology isn't there yet, too?  He wants to show them in chronological order.  Yeah.  So he'll probably pull one out every, what, 18 months or something?  And put Hayden Christensen at the end, instead of the fucking Darth Vader guy, under the helmet.  Ah, how stupid that was.  Oh, God. 
[00:10:30]  And he was terrible, Hayden Christensen.  He was terrible.  He was terrible.  He's not, he's not, he's a good-looking guy, but he was terrible in those movies.  Darth Vader is now relegated to being a whiny little fuck the entire time he was fucking growing up.  And a really handsome guy.  A young, a young, he had to go with a young Hollywood honk.  Oh, I'm petting me.  Oh, I'm petting me.  This isn't fair.  Not fair.  Shut up.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Why couldn't George Lucas find, like, a young Willem Dafoe type guy out there in Hollywood? 
[00:11:00]  Why does it always have to be, quote, the young honk?  I actually know why.  He's an asshole.  Okay.  That makes sense.  There's got to be some ugly actors coming up.  You don't have to always go with the good-looking ones, right?  It sucked.  I was up to that part.  God, see?  You should have gotten it.  What, is it a bunch of stars here or what?  Let's have a walk.  Speaking of movies, you see the picture of Macaulay Culkin?  Everyone's talking about that today.  I saw him recently at a benefit. 
[00:11:30]  I met him for the first time.  Did he look all right?  Was it for Mr. Kite?  No, it was...  Did he look all right?  Because you see the front page of the paper?  Oh.  That picture was everywhere yesterday afternoon.  He's not...  What are they doing?  They're comparing him with the little kid with his hands on his cheeks.  He's older.  What the fuck?  None of us can compare it to the younger version of ourselves.  No, I was adorable.  Do they need to say then and now like we wouldn't know which is which?  He's two in the one end.  They're saying he's got a Gary Busey thing going on.  Well, a lot of people saying, you know, the high five, crystal meth, heroin, alcoholism, 
[00:12:00]  all sorts of fucking shit is coming out now, right?  I bet he's just growing up a little funny looking.  I think...  You beat me to the punch, but I think he just grew up to look ugly.  Yeah, a little funny looking.  What happens?  Not every cute kid grows up to be, you know, a Hollywood hunk.  More than most even.  That's right.  And he's a nice guy.  He was in...  It was the benefit for...  Mr. Kite?  No, not Mr. Kite.  I forget...  Oh, my God. 
[00:12:30]  How do I forget what it was for?  I'm such a dick.  But it was...  Because you were too worried about what celebrities you can take pictures with?  Oh, oh.  You know what?  You're probably correct.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I think he was the only celebrity who was there.  He did the raffle.  Gaffigan was on the show myself.  And I talked to him, Todd Barry, after outside.  I took a picture with him.  He was very nice.  I asked him about acting for a second.  I think he said he was retiring from acting.  Really?  Yeah.  But it was weird watching him in the dressing room.  I didn't speak to him in the dressing room. 
[00:13:00]  But he was a very confident guy.  And he was very friendly and very accessible.  But he was definitely a man.  Like, he didn't remind you.  He wasn't like a boy-child type guy.  He was like a man.  He was behaving like a guy.  Yeah, yeah.  He was cool.  I don't know why he would retire.  He probably just...  I don't know.  He seems like a strange guy.  We used to see him on 57th Street when we worked at N.E.W.  He must have had an office around there.  He'd be like...  He'd walk around like he didn't want to be noticed. 
[00:13:30]  That's for sure.  Yeah.  And he just was very...  I don't know.  He seemed like an oddball.  Yeah.  Might be a nice guy, but he seems a bit odd.  He was a little thin.  Yeah.  Yeah, in that picture, absolutely.  Oh, yes.  Remember his marriage.  Kunis fucking ruined him, huh?  Mila Kunis?  Mila Kunis ruined him.  Is that who he was married to?  He was with her for a while.  And fuck, she must have ruined him.  He was, yeah.  How long was he with her?  Eight years, I think.  Wow, really?  A long time, yeah. 
[00:14:00]  She fucking ruined him.  Because he married that blonde chick, didn't he?  Some blonde...  They got married when they were like 20 years old or something, both of them.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Is that his wife?  Yeah.  That's recent.  Oh, yeah.  Who is he?  Well, if that's recent, then there's a massive drop-off between the picture you're showing  us, Sam, and the one in the paper.  So that is disturbing.  Because that...  He looks like a normal, older guy.  In his 30s or whatever he would be.  Right?  He's 30-something.  Didn't Mila Kunis have no ass?  Yeah.  She's got a short, flat ass, but the rest of her is fucking beautiful. 
[00:14:30]  He also married that girl, Rachel Miner, who was in the movie Bully, if you saw that  one.  Oh, yeah.  She was naked through that whole movie.  What'd she look like?  Good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Open the fucking door.  Friday morning.  Open the fucking door.  How about the Yankees?  I love it.  I mean...  I look forward to it every Friday, too.  I'm just like...  The elevator door opens.  I go, here it comes.  Friday morning.  Good morning.  Whoa.  What's she doing naked? 
[00:15:00]  She was naked throughout the whole movie.  That's what B-Rock said.  I don't know.  Whoa.  Pussy shot.  What the fuck is that on her back?  Where are you going?  Let me see that pussy.  Over to the right.  Over to the right.  Down.  Down.  Down.  Down.  You panicking.  Sam, tell me the pussy.  Why are you panicking?  Where's the pussy?  No.  No, that's not it.  Wrong shot.  Holy shit.  I want to fucking beat you up.  Click on the pussy.  Yes.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  That's a good morning.  Good morning.  Friday pussy morning.  Friday morning.  I love that guy. 
[00:15:30]  Look at that coiffed triangle.  Oh, yeah.  Good morning.  Same.  I'll always appreciate that.  Really?  Yeah.  The triangle.  I like the coiffed triangle.  The nicely kept.  Yeah.  Nothing like a fucking, you know, ape down there.  But something good.  You know, a little something to know where you are.  X marks the spot kind of thing.  It's a triangle.  So, well, we got to talk about a guy.  Here, here.  We made the Canadian news last night. 
[00:16:00]  I guess it's like a version of TMZ.  And I guess they, quote, tried to get a hold of us.  But they certainly did not.  No, I've been reading the tweetster.  And I got to tell you, no one getting in touch with me.  These idiots are going to Opie and Anthony.  Like, or O and A.  They're going to all these combined Twitter account things.  Like, both of us or the show or.  It's like, no.  We have our own dunce.  We're not that hard to get.  And we're not hard to find.  I have my real email address on my Twitter profile. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Right.  So, I've gotten no emails that were indicative that anybody in the news wanted to talk to me.  We just said this.  The media does this all the time.  Because they, you know, they don't want your side of the story sometimes.  Right.  It makes a better story if they, you know, don't chase you down.  But, so, I'll be honest, man.  This Tom Green thing.  We had the comedian Tom Green in.  We love him.  Yeah.  He's kind of a newer friend of the show.  But we've hit it off.  Asked him about his, why doesn't he have Tom Green as his Twitter. 
[00:17:00]  He has Tom Green live.  And then we got into it.  Right.  Yeah.  And in our dumb world, it's a day.  It's a day of radio.  It's nothing.  It's a dumb day.  Exactly.  We didn't provoke shit.  We enjoyed what happened.  I'll be honest with you from a comedic standpoint.  But we didn't fucking.  Right.  It's funny.  We didn't fucking provoke shit.  And this guy, he's a professor, is obsessed with the attention.  So, now what?  Two weeks later, we're still talking about it. 
[00:17:30]  I know.  And it's because he's granting interviews and all this shit for nonsense.  Yeah.  It's a nonsense thing.  I don't know why on Twitter, if someone's bothering you, you block them.  You block them and now you never have to fucking deal with them.  There really is something to be said.  What happens is when someone, like, I tend to be very combative.  Right.  So, I kind of understand what it is.  Like, if somebody attacks me, I attack them back.  Right.  So, that's what he's doing.  But I can't pretend that I'm wounded by it when they attack me. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Because I sometimes will foster an aggressive relationship by attacking them back.  And I do it all the time on Twitter.  Right.  A columnist was telling me that last night.  He's like, you go.  I always go after them.  But I can't take, if they hit me, I have to hit back.  Yeah.  And I block them.  But if I block them, I never think of them.  I just can't take how stupid some of these people are.  Yeah.  Some of them are dumb.  I don't care about the haters much.  I really care about how just dumb and stupid some of these people are, where they don't  even listen to the basics of something before they tweet nonsense at you. 
[00:18:30]  Yep.  That's what's frustrating to me.  But this guy, he absolutely is loving the attention.  But he has to make believe he's really hurt by this.  He's a professor.  He should know better.  So, I don't know.  I guess it's called City News.  I don't even know if it's a big fucking news channel.  I heard it's sort of like a TMZ type thing.  Is that some kind of Canadian thing?  They did a whole story on it yesterday.  I tweeted the video if you want to check it out. 
[00:19:00]  But we got the audio version for the people today.  And here we go again, two weeks later, because the professor is keeping the story going.  Yeah.  And my message to the professor is simple.  Nothing is going to come of this.  Move on with your stupid life.  I know.  What is the end game here?  Right.  Did he want an apology?  What's that?  We don't apologize for shit.  We should.  What, are we going to apologize for this?  No.  No, of course not.  Asshole.  I think in his world, he would like us to be kicked off Twitter and arrested. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's...  You know why?  Because that would keep the story going for him.  Yeah.  He strikes me as, again, a guy who is...  Ew, he called us louts.  Who wants to be...  That's actually a pretty funny word.  Who wants to be combative back.  Right.  So just be that guy.  Like, don't...  You don't have to act like you're being bullied and wounded.  Just if you're attacking these people...  Because when you're retweeting negative things people say about...  Yeah.  All you're doing is making other people...  Like, you're making other people want to tweet negative stuff at you. 
[00:20:00]  Because whoever you tweeted...  He...  He...  Sorry, Jimmy.  Sorry.  Sorry, sorry.  No, go ahead.  No, I fucked you.  I'm sorry.  So whoever he tweets has followers.  So these people have no idea this was happening.  Then we'll see him retweet a negative thing by somebody.  And they'll...  It's like...  You can't put it on us.  I just took pleasure in it.  He retweeted my tweet that said,  Hey, at CNET News, here's my quote.  I didn't do shit.  And he had to retweet that. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, he had to retweet it.  And then look.  Go up higher.  Because he's so into this.  And not in a good way.  He writes, uh...  Busy day all of a sudden.  City News is stopping by for a chat.  And a bunch of Edge videos are ready to record the Cub cars.  Make that City News.  He's excited.  Everyone's not paying attention to him.  Very excited.  He's got a little...  He's got his little moment.  I'll say this.  He's better at starting a buzz than we are.  Who should hire him for the show? 
[00:21:00]  And Lord knows we've tried everything.  Nothing fucking sticks out there.  Hey, would you work as a publicist in the U.S.?  Yeah, really.  But here, the news.  City News picked up the dumb story.  That's going to go nowhere, Mr. Tom Green.  No, it's nothing.  Crusade, you sound like a baby.  You're a grown man claiming to be cyberbullied.  Stop looking for attention.  Okay.  Well, this is cyberbullying, and it's happening in real time.  His name is Tom Green.  His name is Tom Green. 
[00:21:30]  His name.  His name.  His name is Tom.  I wouldn't talk to these dummies anyway.  This is Tom Green, a professor of multimedia at Humber College.  He happens to share a name with a famous comedian.  In cyberspace, Tom Green, the professor, has the Twitter handle, Tom Green.  And so he asked his followers to ask me very politely if I could give up my name and give  it to him. 
[00:22:00]  And I jokingly replied back, well, hold on, Tom.  I was born well before you, so I had the name first.  On January 25th, Tom Green, the comedian, appeared on a radio show in New York City to promote  his tour.  The hosts of the show brought up the Twitter dilemma.  Boom, Tom Green.  Boom.  Boom.  Give the fancy Tom Green live his name back.  Boom.  That's when the tweets from the show's fans and the comedian's followers started pouring in.  You know, and the funny part is, you were reading somebody's tweet already, but they're 
[00:22:30]  acting like we're saying, this is how dumb the news is.  They just play a clip and they don't know what they're playing.  No, I know.  They think those boos are genuine.  They don't understand that those are over-the-top nonsensical.  Of course.  Boo!  There's nothing real about that.  I don't boo like that.  Of course.  But these dumbbells on the news are like, oh, there's a good clip.  There's booing.  I love our show.  Boo!  Boo!  He's a... 
[00:23:00]  Boo!  That is a...  And should...  His own...  Boo!  That's a clip from...  Yeah.  It continues.  And I happened to check my Connect account and suddenly it just went zing.  And it was just...  It was unbelievable.  Which got him very excited.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you say that, Tom?  You were so excited.  That everyone was paying attention to your dumb Twitter. 
[00:23:30]  And it was just...  It was unbelievable what I was being called.  Take a look at all these tweets.  1,500 in all since January 25th.  And all of them aimed at Tom Green, the professor.  Now, we can't show you most of these because they are riddled with obscene language.  But here's a sample of what we can't put to air.  Now, I take no pleasure in bashing a gay man like you.  But you should give up the name and kill yourself.  Thanks.  One person wrote.  Another said, a friend of mine went to Humber.  She said she was raped by Tom Green. 
[00:24:00]  I'm starting to think she meant professor at Tom Green.  He looks the type.  The comedian would not speak to City News on camera about the incident, but did say in  a Twitter conversation that he had nothing to do with the attacks on the professor.  I am happy being at Tom Green live.  This is not being instigated by me.  I'll tell you who it's continually being instigated by Tom retweeting people. 
[00:24:30]  Like, for instance, you're just giving dickheads who are saying things to you on Twitter, you're  making what they say important.  It's not important what they're saying.  Giving them a forum.  They don't know you.  You know they don't know you.  There's not people that know this guy.  Let's be honest.  Some of them are fans just being silly.  Some of them are just aggressive dickheads who attack everybody.  You can't take that seriously.  You block them and you don't even think about it.  A lot of times, if you look, they have two followers and then you're giving them a forum  of all your followers.  Dude, I make fun of Dana Whitefeather all the time. 
[00:25:00]  It's like, Dana, you have a million, eight, whatever Twitter followers.  Yeah.  You know, and fucking you're attacking a guy back with six Twitter followers.  Yeah.  Like, who cares?  Just block it.  But that's where that aggressive thing comes in and that confrontational thing.  You know, it's like if you like to be confrontational and you want to punish people who've  said bad things to you, then say that.  Say, you know what?  I don't like it and I want them fucking penalized for saying shit to me.  But don't act like you're being bullied.  It's hard for me to buy that a grown man is being cyber bullied when there's a block option. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  It's not like you're in a chat room and other teenagers are telling you to kill yourself  because you're fat and you're 15 and you don't know how to handle it.  Right.  This is a different, you're a grownup.  You're a grownup in a grownup world and there's a block option.  These are not people who are interacting in real life.  I don't think he truly believes it.  I don't know if he does or not.  I don't think.  But I know on Twitter you can block.  I don't think so.  I think he goes, he's loving the attention, but he's got to keep pushing, you know, forward  with the whole cyber bullying thing.  Why does he love the attention?  He's a dumb professor somewhere. 
[00:26:00]  Who cares?  I don't know.  Like a bunch of people, they want a little more attention.  Yeah.  Everyone wants their fame now.  If you're in entertainment or something and you think it's going to give you a little  heat.  When we were coming up, people didn't really want to be famous.  We're in a world now that every person wants a little fame.  Yeah.  That's why they're on their Facebook updating like motherfuckers and Twitter and everywhere  else.  So he's like, holy shit, I'm getting followers.  He's looking at his followers and counting them and getting excited.  Here's the third part of the story. 
[00:26:30]  I don't care.  I also think that people want to be heard.  So people are going to him.  He's a professor.  He's probably used to talking.  He probably talks to his students.  He's a guy who's used to being heard.  And here he is on a bigger level.  Hey, look what's happening to me.  And people go, well, what's going on?  Well, I was.  And then there's a story there.  Right.  So it's tempting to milk that or make it go farther simply because people are listening.  That's why I'm hoping he thanks us eventually for all the attention he got.  Really? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm hoping for a thank you.  I wouldn't mind.  Thank you.  I'm not kidding.  I'm really not kidding.  And an apology.  I would like an apology and a thank you.  Yeah.  Because he's trying to say some shit about us that we're not paying attention to.  Yeah.  It's simply a good morning.  A good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning, Twitters.  Good morning.  And he will teach a class on this now.  So that's why I want to thank you.  I think you're right.  Oh, sure he will.  And I want an apology.  Part of his curriculum.  Here's the third part of the story.  I don't care what the age of these people are.  They're acting like children in the way they're speaking to Mr. Green. 
[00:27:30]  And the reality is that what they're doing, for the most part, and every single one you've  shown me, has been nothing but bullying.  So this is considered cyberbullying?  Absolutely.  Some of that, you know, you look at some of those, and you can even move that into the  world.  They've gone beyond this bullying aspect into criminality.  This professor is actually calling it bullying.  What do you think?  Oh, it's definitely a form, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Cyberbullying?  Yeah, because, I mean, if you have that many listeners and people who are actually willing  to listen to you and go and take action, yeah. 
[00:28:00]  You know, it's not just, oh, you suck or whatever.  It's bigger than that.  It's horrible.  They even listed his phone number.  I know.  I noticed that right there.  What do you think about that?  It's too much over the board.  So just to be clear, you have no intention of giving up the handle at Tom Green.  Zero.  Zero.  I am not giving up.  I am Tom Green.  How are you?  Yeah, he likes to be confrontational, I think.  Oh, yeah.  But also, and again, this is the fault of the news.  This is where the news stinks.  You dummies on the news to imply that that number was given out, and I'm going to guess 
[00:28:30]  the number they're talking about is the one that's on his site.  Yes.  Like, why wouldn't, unless there's another number, I don't know, but why wouldn't you  say that it's on his, there's a huge difference between a public figure who does, I guess,  speaking engagements or who has written a bunch of books having a number of contact and  just some anonymous guy's phone number being put out there.  Right.  Right.  The news is terrible.  Very different.  The news is, that newscast was irresponsible. 
[00:29:00]  Criminality, by the way?  Really?  Well, they talked to a Toronto policeman there.  Yeah.  That's the voice you heard at the beginning of that call.  Well, Toronto police.  Whoa.  Mm-hmm.  Is he a Mountie?  I don't know.  Rout a horse?  Dudley Do-Right?  He looks like he is a tough guy.  A tough guy.  Criminality.  First of all, yeah, we talked about it on the show, and then what people do on Twitter,  that's the Twitter universe, as they call it. 
[00:29:30]  And we tried to move on weeks ago.  I think Tom Green was here three weeks ago at this point.  Yeah.  This guy loves it.  He loves it.  What an idiot.  So.  Yeah.  Well.  Mm-hmm.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Fuck him.  There's something I want to say there, but.  Whatever.  I guess we said it all.  Were you going to mention how the only way there's any backlash against GLAAD obsessing 
[00:30:00]  is when they go after a black guy?  Were you going to mention that?  Oh.  Wait, what happened?  It just is.  The Roland Martin thing from CNN, who is the black.  Hilarious.  We have a Roland, and this Roland Martin, I said, for years, looks like a black version  of Roland.  Roland.  He's going to be so fired.  He's suspended right now.  I don't know about that.  Really?  I did agree with you.  What's the latest?  In the paper, it's talking about, uh, there's been, uh...  He's the guy, by the way, just, uh, sorry, Jimmy, just, uh, so everyone's on board during  the Super Bowl.  He tweeted some shit like we all did, and, uh, you know, it might have been considered 
[00:30:30]  anti-gay by some people.  Here's the very brief article in the post.  Yes, hateful towards gays.  Hateful.  Oh.  CNN's suspension this week of commentator Roland Martin for purportedly anti-gay tweets  has not gone down well with the black media.  Has GLAAD become a bullying organization?  Read the headline of a column on a media watchdog site, Mediate.  Roland Martin GLAAD, CNN GLAAD, and the silence of black leaders was the headline on another 
[00:31:00]  column.  Um, it's, uh, and, uh, I'm having to post a blog posted by black Republican political  strategist, blah, blah, blah, said that CNN bowed to pressure from GLAAD.  It's amazing.  You guys, I know you think we're crazy to obsess over this stuff, but he tweets something that  GLAAD doesn't like, he gets in trouble, and the black media comes to his defense, but  if you tweet something that makes fun of black people, these same people are calling for you  to be fired from being a racist, and if someone comes to your defense, you're deemed a racist. 
[00:31:30]  The whole thing is, and I'm not being self-righteously indignant, this is the shit that will cost  me my job someday.  It's extremely hypocritical.  That's what drives me crazy.  It's not holier than thou.  It will eventually get me fired.  Yeah.  Where's Reverend Al on this one?  Has he said anything?  Well, he's black, not gay, so he'd be on the black side.  Yeah, oh, without a doubt.  But, I mean, why isn't he speaking up?  Because he works for a competing network?  They were the ones with the cum on their face!  Why isn't he speaking up?  Just because he works for MSNBC and Roland Martin's from CNN? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, probably.  And what is Bill O'Reilly saying?  Karma may have caught up with CNN's Roland Martin.  What, Bill O'Reilly thinks he should be fired?  I don't know, probably.  Bill always takes that weird tack that you don't think he's going to take, and then he  does.  None of these guys should be getting fired.  Period.  Even though he was...  I don't care what color you are, I don't care what you like sexually, none of these fucking  guys should be getting fired for expressing, you know, some thoughts.  I think he was happy.  I just went, too. 
[00:32:30]  He was one of those guys.  I think so, too.  I think Bill O'Reilly secretly liked it.  No, I mean Roland Martin.  I love seeing these two organizations beating the shit out of each other, because they're  two organizations that do call for people's firings over just freedom of speech issues,  and now it's just a battle of hypocrites.  Like you said, the black group who's saying that this guy shouldn't be fired, and they're  being bullied by that, they use the exact same tactics.  And they're only defending him because he's black, and it's like, I get that in 1968. 
[00:33:00]  But he's a news anchor who's on Twitter, and he Twittered something that would get a white  news anchor the same amount of bullshit.  Why wouldn't you come to a white news anchor?  It's so phony.  You want him to be treated equally?  There you go.  Fucking...  Dude!  It's amazing how black groups don't want the same level of accountability for doing certain  things.  Sorry!  Equality means this guy gets fucking fired without any recourse.  No group to help him or anything. 
[00:33:30]  And we'll say it again, when the whole Imus thing went down, we supported Imus, and the  black radio shows in general in New York City were all rah, rah, yes, let's fire this  fucker.  And we said at the time, you guys are the dumbest people alive because eventually they'll go  after you.  Without a doubt.  That's why you gotta fucking support all these guys when they step into little shit.  I want...  If I'm gonna watch all this TV, I want these people to be able to express themselves, whether  it's on the air or, believe it or not, off the air. 
[00:34:00]  Because at least you're like, oh, okay, this is how this guy is when he's not, you know,  being fake on TV because he's scared shitless.  It is amazing how...  That's why you can't listen to any of it.  Again, I've been quoting Matt and Trey.  One of those guys from South Park said either it's either all okay or none of it is.  And I've said that many times.  Yeah, it's true.  It's such a brilliant, simplistic way of putting it.  But it's the only way you can look at being humorous.  You know, you can't...  Because what is offensive now will not be offensive in...  I mean, what's not offensive now will be offensive in six months. 
[00:34:30]  Because with social issues, it changes.  It's like...  Time is like a river.  A river.  But it flows.  Good morning.  And the sacred cow keeps moving.  Yeah.  And now all of a sudden you're doing jokes that you would have done last year.  And here you go.  Well, you step in what is now the anti-PC pile of shit.  And you're in big shit for something you wouldn't have been in for...  Right.  How do you take it seriously?  So you think Roland Martin might...  Roland?  He might skate, yeah.  Because the black groups are going to push back.  Because, of course, that's what they do.  It has nothing to do with his race. 
[00:35:00]  But simply because he's black and he's being criticized and he may be fired,  then the black groups will pipe up.  Because they are just as phony as the gay groups, as every religious group.  They're all fraudulent.  To know who the biggest phony is, is Reverend Al.  Because he hasn't said shit, right?  Well, he's terrible.  But he should be calling for his firing, right?  Sure.  He's a network shill now.  Shouldn't you be calling for his firing?  Sure.  He hasn't said shit.  He's in a tough spot right now.  Why wouldn't he?  The guy anti-gay tweet. 
[00:35:30]  Why wouldn't he?  Oh, yeah.  Why wouldn't he?  Well, did he say anything about Greek homos like Reverend Al did?  Look, I'm on the fence when something is, I guess, is hateful when it's someone in the mainstream media.  But, you know, with this Roland Martin, with his Super Bowl tweet, he was just going for a stupid joke.  We know what he was doing.  He was just trying to make his dumb, stupid joke.  That's all he was going for.  Yeah.  I didn't see no hate in that.  No.  I saw a guy being a guy and saw something and said, oh, fuck, I think I got something funny I could tweet here. 
[00:36:00]  Period.  I like to see it happening to the media.  Like, I loved when Al Roker got it.  I love when he's getting it.  Because these are hypocrites and they're phonies when it comes to this type of talk.  But I also don't think they should be fired.  What was the tweet?  Oh, you don't know?  Do we have it?  No.  Oh, yeah.  What was the tweet?  It was about...  It was about...  One was a Beckham commercial where he was in his underwear.  Oh, okay.  And he said something about, hey, if you have friends over, any of you guys, any of your friends at your party are excited about David Beckham and his underwear, slap the ish out of him. 
[00:36:30]  Like, I guess he can't curse on his tweets.  Well, ish is just when people are trying to be polite on Twitter, that's the word they use instead of shit.  We learned that yesterday.  I would agree with these black groups about GLAAD being a bullying organization.  If the black groups weren't being racially biased and only defending him based on race, if they were defending him based on merit, I would agree with them.  And then another guy that's probably...  You don't think he's going to get fired, huh?  I don't know now.  Let's just say another guy in a lot of trouble for something he didn't even do on the air. 
[00:37:00]  The network's in a great position.  What dick do we suck?  Do we suck the GLAAD dick or do we suck the black journalist dick?  Like, what special interest group do we cowardly cave into because we're white executives?  Yeah, we don't know.  We don't know.  Oh, my God.  I would assume you got to suck the black dick because those guys got dongers.  But really, what special interest group do you fucking give in to?  That's why I don't think he's going to get fired.  He might not.  Suspension.  They could suspend him to appease the gay group, and then they could keep him on to appease the black group. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  That's amazing.  A two-week suspension paid.  But it's amazing that black journalists or anybody in black organizations would come to his defense when he's simply in trouble for doing something that was deemed anti-gay.  Right.  It was absolutely disconnected from race.  Yeah, yeah.  And are they that delusional?  They don't think that a white reporter would be penalized?  Of course he would.  Of course he would.  So you can't play it as he's a black man and needs our group to defend him.  Seven o'clock, we've got to turn the TV on. 
[00:38:00]  What happened?  Greg Kelly?  Yeah, we should.  Yeah.  Yeah, we've got to make sure we get that audio.  I definitely want to hear that.  The paper's saying that he is going to address the whole thing.  Yeah.  I think he'll address it in light of recent incidents.  It'll be a quick statement.  I wish her well.  I don't like him to go like, that fucking bitch.  Well, that's what we were saying yesterday.  Let me do this shit, yeah.  And they'll do the paper shuffle.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's going to be a quick 30-second sort of statement, and then they're going to just move on.  Very vague.  No details.  As you know, he fucking better thank us, too, because we were the only ones that came to his defense right away. 
[00:38:30]  Greg Kelly, I expect a thank you today on live fucking TV.  Who supported you?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Because in the end, we're smarter than all of them.  I'll say this for us.  As much as we are boobs, we are across the board supportive of people saying stuff that we don't like.  Yes, exactly.  Completely.  And we know when a rape charge is bullshit.  Absolutely, because we're all rapists.  Right.  We all know when it's all trumped up. 
[00:39:00]  We know the face of a rapist, for Pete's sake.  We have mirrors.  And we've been raped in enough contract negotiations.  Yes, that's true.  We're victims.  What's Greg Kelly's Twitter?  Maybe we should make sure he knows that we are expecting an apology in ten minutes.  Not an apology.  Thank you.  I mean, a thank you.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Yeah, thank you.  You're right.  Sorry.  It's still early.  Yeah.  I like the fact that we just go off, say shit that other people don't.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  We're good like that.  We never get credit for this. 
[00:39:30]  No, we don't.  We really don't get credit for it.  We get nothing.  Everyone else kept their stupid mouths shut.  And we're like, this is obviously bullshit what's happening to this guy.  Rapity rape rape.  Yeah.  They all kept their mouths shut.  Why can't you just talk about it openly and honestly?  They're like, how many, how many, how many, how many, how many, how many?  It's not written down for me, so I don't know if I should say anything.  Of course, shit.  All right, we should break.  We'll be back by seven, right?  Oh, shit. 
[00:40:00]  What?  Should we be on live when this happens?  His statement?  Should be.  Oh.  He should probably be on live.  What happens?  In case we have to comment, or in case he shoots himself like fucking Peter Finch and  network.  It threatens to.  So what, he's on in seven minutes?  Yeah, we won't be back by then.  We got too many reads.  So let's start reading right now.  I'll do one right now.  Yeah.  I'll incorporate it into the show.  I don't mind doing the first one, or as we say, get the ball in.  By the way, I kept track of this.  The listeners officially have had it with live reads. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, I don't doubt it.  They have officially had it.  People are noticing that the replays are shorter.  Because we cut out the live reads?  Oh.  So there's actually a difference now.  Well, listeners, this.  They got to organize this shit better down the hall, because the listeners have officially  had it.  They also have to realize, too, that Valentine's Day, we get a lot.  A lot of people want to send candy and flowers and hearts, because guys hate Valentine's  Day.  Yeah.  I mean, they really do. 
[00:41:00]  Not even just for the read.  They honestly hate it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Before, because I know you're going into a read.  You fucked me yesterday.  No, you're not going to say that.  You fucked me.  No, I didn't.  Everyone's saying you made me say Shari's Berries all morning, and it is Shari's Berries.  I mean, it is Shari's Berries, not Sherry's.  Shari doesn't rhyme with berry.  I would always say Shari's Berries.  I've always had a problem with that.  Well, we addressed it yesterday, and Sam keeps correcting me and saying, no, it's Shari's  Berries.  No, he's got to rhyme.  It's Shari's Berries.  You would say Shari's Berries, because you need to rhyme, you know, because you're a 
[00:41:30]  dumbbell.  Yeah.  Her name is her name.  But everyone's saying no.  I would say...  They've seen it in other places where it's Shari's Berries, just like it's spelled.  So what would you do if the mayor of D.C. had it?  Would you call it Marion Berries Berries?  No, you'd say Marion Berries Berries.  Well, that's a different branding phrase.  Some people do say Shari like Sherry.  Yeah, Sherry.  It's spelled...  Depending on where you're from in the country.  But it's spelled S-H-A-R-I.  So that's Shari.  Yeah, I would say Sherry's Berries every time.  She fucked up.  She fucked up by making it not rhyme, I guess. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, it's not good branding.  By the way, I was in the gym, and they had a commercial for Sherry's Berries.  And it goes back to the mole thing.  They had long-time customers of Sherry's Berries.  And one woman who was talking had a big fucking berry on her lip.  And it's just between the berries and the berry on her face.  I was like, I don't know if she's going to help you sell the berries.  Or it might be my thing.  It's a good Valentine's Day gift.  It drove me nuts.  Oh, yeah, it is.  I mean, you know, people...  I don't like Valentine's. 
[00:42:30]  I mean, you know, I'm just speaking for me.  It's guys in general don't like Valentine's Day.  Because there's a lot of pressure there.  It's to get the perfect gift.  Gift, you know, it's like...  I mean, I'm not married, but for me, it would be a girlfriend, for you to be a wife, but...  Sure.  It's all been done before.  What do you do?  What do you do?  Get her a gift you can get credit for all year long.  What do you do?  Right, Jim.  I mean, for me, Stephen Singer.  I mean, he has the perfect gift for Valentine's Day just for you.  It's a real...  And I'm not even reading this.  I'm going to say it from the heart. 
[00:43:00]  It's a real long stem rose dipped in 24-carat pure gold.  Just go online.  Go to 1-8...  I hate Stephen Singer, 1-800.  Go to IHateStevenSinger.com.  What?  We're just shell-shot at this point.  You can pick up the traditional Valentine's Day red rose or one of his premium colors.  And I really mean it, honestly.  My ex-text to me it is the only keepsake she saved was that dumb rose.  She really loved it. 
[00:43:30]  Choose your very own personalized message of love for the included card.  Just do it now and shipping is still free.  That's right.  There's still time to order.  It's Friday morning right now for free shipping.  You should receive it before Valentine's Day.  You're going to get a real rose dipped in 24-carat pure gold.  It's not a fake rose.  It's not a plastic rose.  It's a real rose that has been murdered.  It's dipped in 24-carat gold and enclosed in a beautiful gift box.  We're not going to wrap it in just a wrapping paper.

But right now I just wanted to speak from the heart.  Oh, good.  Thank you.  Listen.  And stupid Sam has to prove me wrong.  Well, listen to it.  He found audio.  Listen to it.  Which channel, by the way, is Greg Kelly on?  Yeah, we're just about there. 
[00:45:00]  Good.  I love you.  Work of art from this fresh, juicy strawberry.  A gourmet Sherry's Berry.  Okay.  Okay.  Sherry's Berry.  Once again, you can trust your producers over your Twitter followers.  I didn't do shit!  I didn't do shit, Sam.  It is kind of a weird way that you have to say it.  Thank you, Anthony.  But it does fit.  Sherry's Berries.  Yeah.  Sherry's?  Sherry's?  Sherry.  However you say berry, it says Sherry that way.  They rhyme.  I say Sherry's.  I say berries.  That works, then.  Sherry's Berry.  But some people actually say Barry like berry. 
[00:45:30]  Berry.  Berry.  I think Sam's one of those guys.  Sherry's Berry sounds like Valley Gym a little bit.  I like Sherry's Berry.  You're so grody.  Grody?  Did you find the lady with the berry right above her lip trying to sell the Sherry's Berries?  Drove me nuts in the gym.  The dumbest things drive me nuts.  Drove me nuts?  That's not the commercial I saw, because that's the Christmas one.  You've got to find the Valentine's Day one, and then you'll know exactly what I'm talking 
[00:46:00]  about.  We're just wasting time.  Did you talk about the four and a half foot bear yesterday?  Not for that.  Yeah, we did.  Oh, God.  Did you talk about it?  That's a big bear.  That certainly is.  They like the word big in their copy.  I noticed.  Oh, yeah.  Big.  Big, big.  Big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,  Big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big 
[00:46:30]  This is Good Day, New York.  Everyone's watching this right now.  Good day, New York.  Good morning.  Good day, New York.  It is Friday, February 10th.  I'm Greg Kelly. 
[00:47:00]  I'm Rosanna Scotto.  So nice to have you with us this morning.  It's going to be nice and sunny and mild high of 47.  But snow is on the way.  Really?  You start with weather?  It's going to tell you what to expect.  Right now, fierce flames tearing through a house in Plainfield, New Jersey.  Really?  I wish it was someone's house.  It's tearing through it like a cop through a vagina.  Only two dozen city schools will be shut or modified.  Oh, boy.  And subway riders get ready for another round of overnight shutdowns. 
[00:47:30]  And I'm not going to be accused of rape.  As that train goes into that tunnel voluntarily.  And Lynn Saturday.  Jeremy Lynn returns to the family night.  That's right.  He slams the ball in the hole, but it's allowed.  I've fucking told you about this guy three days ago.  He's living on his brother's couch.  I heard about that.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Speaking of couches.  It's great to see you, folks.  Thank you.  It was a tough couple of weeks, obviously, for a lot of people.  And I'm very, very grateful for all the support I had here at Box 5, the support from my family, 
[00:48:00]  friends, those I care about, and the viewers, of course.  They've been just great.  The people who watched this show and have weighed in through social media, the positive remarks.  Thank you very much.  It's great to be back.  I'm especially grateful again to this lady who sits next to me every day, Rosanna Scotto.  Don't touch me.  You ready to get back to work?  I'm so happy you're back.  And, of course, I'm getting ready.  Oh!  He touched her hand.  Unhand me! 
[00:48:30]  Unhand me!  Going right back to where we left off.  Really?  All right.  Well, I'm not sure about that.  That's right.  To you harassing me in the cop here.  Today's Friday also.  Come on.  Let's take it easy.  Friday morning.  Good morning.  And now here's the weather by the guy that they normally would accuse because he's not  white.  They just fell apart.  Everybody's very happy to have your back here.  He's all awkward.  He's the worst improver, right?  Yeah.  Remember?  Yes.  Yeah.  I guess we've got to get your weather forecast here as well.  We are looking at another call. 
[00:49:00]  I love Mike Woods.  He couldn't even improv a welcome back.  And you see the look on his face?  Welcome, Roe Rape.  Well, ah, fuck.  The look on Mike Woods' face is like, God damn, if you were black, this would have turned  out differently.  You'd have been in prison.  Right.  I don't know how you said, like, of course, that we knew that would be the statement.  Yeah.  But how do you, I guess that's the way to do it, just to say thank you.  Oh, that's the way normal people in media do it, not like us.  That was a little better than usual.  A little better, but.  Why wouldn't you say I was accused of something?  You'd say, oh, no, don't mention it. 
[00:49:30]  No accusations, no this, no that, I'm sure.  At least tell us how the pussy was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look.  Sexy.  I fucked her.  It was consensual.  Right.  We were a little liquored up.  Right.  And, yeah, just really spell it out.  I pulled out.  I came on her chest.  And I made her clean it up, because that's what I do.  And she took this as being degrading, yelled at me, and ran out.  Yeah.  I did try to put it in her pooper, but she wasn't drunk enough. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, she did squirm a bit, but I stopped.  I stopped.  I realized that was a no.  I'm good like that.  But the front door was open, so I continued.  Dude, I did make one of those blowjob smack face videos with her.  Yes.  I did ask to mouth.  She didn't know I was going to do that.  And apparently she did not like the taste of her own shit. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  That I do apologize for.  And then Roseanne Scott was just sitting there in shock.  Just with fucking, oh, my God, what is he saying?  You know, he touched her hand, and she kind of, like, pushed upwards, like, I don't really,  I don't know.  Off of me.  I don't know if we should be doing that.  Just doing this to keep my job.  Right.  And, you know, when she acts shocked when he says that, and she's like, why wouldn't  she do an enema first?  Yes.  If you know you're going to have your shitter invaded, why wouldn't he?  And he's like, I don't know, Roseanne.  I don't know.  We were drunk, Roseanne. 
[00:51:00]  We were drunk.  House in Plainfield is burning.  I would love to spray it with cum.  You know, that's where Rich Voss is from.  He didn't burn down two houses, did he?  Oh, no.  How great would that be?  I mean, how tragic would that be?  Tragic.  Tragedy.  We can eat now.  He gave a statement.  Oh, okay.  Y'all are.  Come on in.  Come on in.  You know, there's a, um, anyone else see the eight-minute video? 
[00:51:30]  Video by the father.  Everyone's talking about this fucking thing.  The father.  Chinese kid.  It always has like 10,000 comments.  This video is massive, but it's eight minutes long, basically talking about how you should  handle your kids.  Really?  And supposedly, it's really good, but I, I, I didn't, I didn't, uh, listen.  I didn't watch it yet.  Well, I thought you meant the, uh, the Chinese father.  Oh.  Oh, that.  I thought you meant it.  We should talk about that, too.  No, there's another one.  This guy.  Well, I, I, I'll explain it after the break.  Fuck it. 
[00:52:00]  But, I mean, maybe we, we start the video and see if it's worth it.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm always a game for that one.  Because supposedly he's being a real father and then supposedly he's really just letting  his kid fucking, you know, know what's up and stop being a fucking punk, basically.  Yeah, punk.  A white guy, he just sits in a lawn chair in his yard and just makes an eight minute video  like, this is what's up.  Period.  Cool.  Enough with your nonsense.  Watch that.  So maybe we'll do that next.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPNN 3 Show. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, oh.  Oh, no.  Must be the anniversary of his death.  I got this one.  Oh.  I got this one.  Oh, boy.  Great.  Great.  Any person. 
[00:53:00]  Keep fucking that chicken.  This is not the original.  Good guy.  Good guy.  Good guy.  Awesome.  That's when things got out of control.  She didn't want to.  He had his way.  She said, let's go. 
[00:53:30]  He said, no way.  Hey, baby.  It's a lucky day.  Shut your mouth.  They're gonna do it my way.  Come on, baby.  Don't be afraid.  If it wasn't for date rape, I'd never get laid.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the Sex Man.  Good morning, Sex Man.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Wow.  That wasn't Sublime, though, was it? 
[00:54:00]  No, this is Fish Bone.  Oh, on purpose you did that.  Okay.  Why wouldn't you go Sublime?  Because we did the Sublime one before, so this one's Fish Bone.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone hears Sublime's date rape all the time.  You're right.  Question.  They do.  It's on regular rock radio all the time.  Is it?  Yeah.  Is it really?  Sam's saying no.  I'm not.  I was just about to say, I didn't know regular rock radio even exists anymore.  Yeah, I want to be listening to that instead of supporting the platform that pays your fucking  brand new way too big for your house.  It's a mansion.  Way too big for your house. 
[00:54:30]  Why would you support this platform?  Exactly.  Invest in yourself.  And when I think of songs that are burnt out, I don't think Sublime date rape.  This version sucks.  I know people like Fish Bone, but Sublime's version is so much better.  Okay.  So, someone did some raping, huh?  That seems to be the...  Allegedly.  No other way to look at it.  Well, it's not alleged, but...  You should play this on October 16th. 
[00:55:00]  Where's it?  The 10th.  Oh.  Oh, wait.  That's boring.  What happened?  No way to do the joke when I'm off by 12 days.  Mike Tyson was convicted of rape 20 years ago to date.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  How long ago was that?  20.  20.  Fuck.  That's 92, right?  I think.  Happens to those years.  They just...  1992's far. 
[00:55:30]  That's far now.  I don't know.  You think of the 90s.  Thank God you didn't play Bob Dylan's The Times They Are Changing.  Because that would have drove him nuts.  God.  He's not a fan of the Bob Dylan.  No, he's not.  Really?  You know that song came out 48 years ago?  No, not really a fan of the Dylan.  What's wrong with the Dylan?  Oh, no.  It's just...  He changed everything.  He plugged in, man.  Not real toe-tappers there, you know?  The Times They Are Changing is a toe-tapper.  The Times They Are Changing is... 
[00:56:00]  Shut up.  I like Bob Dylan.  I like him more and more, man.  Ever since his radio show, especially.  I do enjoy him.  What else happened that anyone cares about?  Van Halen's debut album 34 years ago.  Holy shit.  Was it really?  34 years ago.  I will play Van Halen.  I remember sitting there with the headphones on.  What was the name of the Van Halen debut album?  Just Van Halen 1, I guess.  What's a great song off that album?  That would be You Really Got Me.  King's cover.  Running With The Devil. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, Running With The Devil was the big one.  What else was on there?  How many years ago today?  34.  34 years ago.  Fuck, I forgot all the songs on there.  I'll know every fucking song, though.  It was one of those albums that was good from beginning to end.  Come on, let's do this fast.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  So you got The Running With The Devil.  Then you got The Eruption.  You really got me?  I said that already.  He did say that. 
[00:57:00]  That's the only one I said.  That's the only one I said.  What else you got?  Pete Parrott?  That was obvious.  You didn't know.  That was obvious.  Jamie's crying.  Shut up.  I'm going in order.  Why are you participating?  Stop spitting with you.  We have a list here.  What are you doing?  It's not the E&R show.  No.  The reason why I'm doing it this way is because I started by saying this,  the album was great from beginning to end, so I want to go in order.  From beginning to end.  He jumped all the way to the other one.  Yeah.  Mixing it up.  Quit it up.  Shut up. 
[00:57:30]  Then you go with Ain't Talkin' About Love, which probably is my favorite song off the album.  Yours in it?  I don't know that one.  No, you know what?  You don't know Ain't Talkin' About Love.  Running With The Devil was like the big fucking, like that was the song.  The lead in that one just killed you when you first heard it.  And then I kind of liked.  I liked that I'm the one, but it never really got radio play.  No.  That's the one you should play today, Jimmy, if you want to be different.  And then if you want to take it down a little, it was like Little Dreamer or something.  Why don't they have Jamie's Crying highlighted? 
[00:58:00]  Because I guess they highlight the songs, what?  That you could click on for what reason?  Because they were more popular?  They have their own wiki pages.  Oh.  Because Jamie's Crying was a great song.  You should go with Jamie's Crying, Jimmy.  Jamie's Crying!  Crying!  Atomic Punk, not so much for me.  Feel Your Love Tonight was a great song.  Yeah, that was a good one.  How's that go?  Oh, Feel Your Love Tonight.  You should go with that one today, Jimmy.  Can we hear some of that?  For real.  Go with Feel Your Love Tonight.  I'm going to start using this show to get the opening song from my Boneyard show. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, good idea.  A little crossover.  This is Feel Your Love Tonight.  Little Dreamer, Ice Cream Man, and then On Fire.  There's probably two songs I didn't dig.  On Fire and probably Atomic Punk.  Let me hear Ice Cream Man again.  I kind of like Ice Cream Man.  No, we're going with Feel Your Love Tonight.  Turn this fucker up.  Oh, this is good.  Yeah.  All right.  Michael Anthony's vocals on top of the David Lee Roth vocal. 
[00:59:00]  He always did the high voice.  Harmonizing?  Harmonizing, yeah.  Very key to the Van Halen sound.  Yeah.  He's a lot of sounds good.  He's a lot of sounds good.  This rock is a massive Van Halen thing. 
[00:59:30]  It's so weird.  There's a gods to it.  Gods.  That's good.  Does he like the new album?  I actually don't know.  If I see him, I'll ask him.  I don't know.  Tattoo.  Tattoo.  I just don't like that part of it, but I actually don't mind the song.  Well, Andy Levy confused me with his tweet yesterday.  He said, surprisingly, the Van Halen album is good.  And if you follow Andy Levy on Twitter, sometimes you don't know what's up.  Yeah.  I don't know if he's doing a little sarcasm there.  I have no idea.  I don't know.  I think it's pretty good for an album that comes out 30-some-odd years after their first 
[01:00:00]  album.  It could be worse.  Turns out.  I hope you can't really listen to the words.  I got holy girls on the back of my leg.  Ain't she who loves me when I walk?  Speaking Jerry Gray.  Screaming electric green.  Right.  Purple Mountain's majesty. 
[01:00:30]  See, I like that part.  You know what?  Why?  Not that part, though.  It grows on you, though.  I really like the tempo of the song, except for the chorus.  And it sounds like something they easily could have done 30 years ago. 
[01:01:00]  They didn't change the formula like some bands do.  They got the original formula.  Don't fuck with it.  Yeah.  You know, I do like this, too.  I just don't like that chorus.  I got to start singing.  I think I might like it.  I'm not going to download it, though.  I might.  I'm not.  But, Deedle, dude.  Deedle, dude.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I like that part now, too. 
[01:01:30]  You're right, dude.  There we go.  Woo!  I squeezed there.  What?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And Deedle Roth is doing exactly what he did 30 years ago.  Kind of talking his way through songs.  Yeah, yeah.  His voice is still strong. 
[01:02:00]  Shatting his way through songs.  The voice is still there.  Maybe we've got to stop hating on these guys.  This really isn't that bad.  We have given them lots of shit over the years, haven't we?  Jesus.  I want to hate less.  Maybe have more of an open mind about things.  Less hate.  A little less.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  A tad less hatred.  Uh, the reason that chorus sucks is because it's missing that Michael Anthony bite.  Okay.  No, I don't like the choir. 
[01:02:30]  There's Chad in Baltimore.  I don't like the...  Who's singing the highs there, Ant?  Tattoo.  I wouldn't like anybody saying that.  I don't like the lyrics.  Yeah, I like the way it comes off.  It's too choppy.  I bet you Pompasetti decided...  We don't need Michael Anthony.  I'll do that.  I'll do the...  Michael Anthony wasn't coming back.  No, I know.  Yeah.  But maybe they could have hired someone different.  They should have said it like Mr. Rourke.  Tattoo.  Ah, tattoo.  Tattoo.  Tattoo.  Tattoo.  Tattoo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here it comes.  My shoulder is the number of the chapter he was in. 
[01:03:00]  That number is forever like the shoulder hit away on everybody.  Everybody.  I'll be telling.  Trends down tack.  My smile's mind to mom's show.  In the time it comes to get that new tattoo.  Tattoo, tattoo.  That part was a little wordy.  Yeah.  A little wordy.  Yeah.  P-U-P-U. 
[01:03:30]  We got a Van Halenpan saying this was written 30 years ago.  It was called Down in Flames.  Changed lyrics and finally recorded it.  No way.  That's Lou in Youngstown, Ohio.  Who shot himself through a pillow.  Tattoo.  Tattoo.  Ow, it hurts.  Remember him leaning against the glass door.  Yeah.  Is there audio?  9-1-1.  Yeah.  It hurts.  Ow.  You dummy.  Shot himself through a pillow.  Called 9-1-1.  We got Patrick.  He wants to make fun of us. 
[01:04:00]  Go ahead, Patrick.  Welcome aboard, Patty.  Are you guys that old?  This is the worst fucking song.  It's almost as bad as that Twisted Sister 30, whatever it was, 30 came and went.  Honestly, I don't even have a reference point.  I never heard that song by Twisted Sister.  I know you did.  You did.  Oh, we did?  Yeah.  And we hated it, right?  Yeah.  Okay, I don't even remember.  It sounds almost exactly like this.  Don't play it and you'll go, oh my God.  Hey, I said this sucked while you're lumping me in with the homo. 
[01:04:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  Dude, I like the tempo of it, but I don't like the chorus.  Oh, but the guitar, it's just like the generic riffs.  It's just like two chords over and over.  Or it's just like a bunch of old guys that didn't even try to do anything.  They just go, all right, well.  Think about the radio show?  Yeah.  But that's probably them trying at this age.  Yeah.  They probably don't have anything left in the tank.  All right, then just don't try at all.  If you don't got it.  Honestly, there's too much money at stake. 
[01:05:00]  Sure.  These guys are going to make millions in the next couple of years now touring.  That's true.  And what helps is when you get a couple new songs out there.  Yeah, I guess.  I don't mind it as much as the first time I heard it.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah, I like that one part.  And I did say I'm not going to fucking download it.  I'm not that excited about it.  Tramp Stamps Sally.  I like that part.  It sounds like Jane Gumm.  I don't like that part at all. 
[01:05:30]  New tattoo.  You're going to have 15,000 people singing that part all at the same time.  Yeah.  New tattoo tattoo.  Tramp Stamps Sally from Housewives of the Bombshells.  Tattoo.  What do you?  What do you?  In the time to kidnap one fat senator's daughter.  All right, sir.  Thanks.  Fair enough.  He's calling us out.  He thinks it sucks.  Jim in New York.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hello, mate.  That tattoo song's not even on the album. 
[01:06:00]  The rest of the album actually sits there.  Really?  It's not shit on there, yeah.  Why would they put that out if it's not on the album?  I'm confused by that.  Well, you know, David Lee Roth is back in the band.  It's just fucked up.  It's the way it does.  Is it really not on the album?  I heard it was.  Come on.  I have the deluxe album right here in front of me on my iPhone.  It's not on the album.  Did you download the single?  I did.  I downloaded the single, yes.  So it probably just registered as a single since you already downloaded it. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  A nice try, Sam.  What do you mean?  Why can't you download the single and then download the album and it's on the album, too?  Well, I saw the album yesterday.  It's on the album, I think.  So what happened with this guy?  I would think.  He had a different one.  I have the deluxe edition.  They're pushing.  They're selling the album with that song.  Like when I saw it on TV, they're like, get the new Van Halen up.  And they're playing that song and selling the album.  Why wouldn't it be on the album?  Yeah, it just features the new hit single, Tattoo.  Sorry, you know what you're talking about.  Sorry.  You're talking out your bung. 
[01:07:00]  Or you just got a bad download.  You're an idiot.  An idiot.  Maybe a human like George has got the only bad download.  You're stupid.  Why don't we just attack everyone?  I don't get it anymore.  Come on.  Come on.  All right.  Sam, why don't you make a face about it?  What's that?  Is it too late to punch out?  Yes.  You're in flames.  Way too late.  At this point, you've got to kill yourself.  You're a memorial on a wall.  That's right.  Sam's making faces.  Chinatown is a way better song off the album. 
[01:07:30]  We're not going to try it for the new album, are we?  A little Chinatown might be nice.  I like that Twisted stuff there.  Oh, Sam was making a face.  He was digging it.  Yeah.  Sam likes that.  What are we doing?  We're previewing some of the Twisted Sister song, 30.  30.  You're digging it.  30 years.  Just the lyrics.  30 years.  Oh, are they some cool lyrics?  Yeah.  Well, the video starts with them taking dusting the cobwebs off the instruments.  Oh, no.  They were a one-hit wonder.  Now, they had a couple. 
[01:08:00]  We're not going to take it.  Nope.  And, uh...  Come on.  They weren't one-hit.  I Want to Rock is a big hit.  I Want to Rock is a good tune.  We're not going to take it.  All right.  They're in that weird category, two-hit wonders.  They had a few.  There's a few bands that are officially two-hit wonders, and I'll put Twisted Sister in there.  Do you know who else I've been listening to, too?  And I don't know if I...  Is, uh, Quiet Riot, Come On, Feel The Noise.  Like, it's lyrically terrible.  Oh, yeah.  But I fucking love the tempo until it gets to the chorus.  Girls rock your boys.  It's awful.  We get wild, wild, wild.  But I remember as a kid in sixth grade holding my little boombox and, like, wanting the girl 
[01:08:30]  I liked to hear the words.  I was on the bus.  You said, girls rock your boys?  You girls rock your boys.  And I was like, come on, feel that.  This was so heavy.  It is.  And you thought the girl would be impressed?  Because I was holding the radio.  This was rocking back in the day.  Yeah.  Little Jimmy Holies boombox.  Sitting on the bus going on a day trip.  I'm thinking the girl hearing the lyrics would be like, ooh, he's edgy. 
[01:09:00]  He's edgy.  He's crazy.  You gotta bring your boombox on a bus.  He's dangerous.  Yeah.  I was a douche.  He's dangerous.  But don't you like the tempo?  Wouldn't that be cumbersome as you're trying to walk around?  I don't want to admit that I'm enjoying this a lot.  Isn't this guy dead?  Why don't you want to admit that you like this?  This is a great song still.  Lyrically, it's not good at all.  Oh.  And it was spelled C-U-M.  Come on.  And noise was at a Z in it.  That's crazy. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Noise had a Z.  You like that?  So they're not a spell.  Noise had a Z.  Yeah, I thought it made it heavier.  Wow, wow.  Then I was like, you know, girls, rock you boys.  Like, she'd come over and rock me.  Ah, she should have.  And I asked her to kiss me and she ignored it.  All right, let me, uh...  She just held you and rocked you.  I was full of dandruff.  Never.  Dude, my head is caked with dandruff.  I used to sit up front.  You sure that wasn't dried cum?  We've heard the stories over the years.  I would literally sit two feet from the TV and my arm, like, wiped away the fucking 
[01:10:00]  varnish on the TV I had been watching on the table.  Yeah.  And I had so much dandruff.  I would sometimes just scrape my scalp over the table and watch the dandruff take off.  Did you not wash your hair much?  No, I didn't.  Why?  You were just a little unwashed boy with your quiet riot boombox.  I think the girls would notice it.  Yeah, with my cowlicks and my fucking greasy forehead.  I wasn't getting wild.  Because you never washed your hair? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, it was greasy.  I had a lot of dandruff.  Sels and blue wasn't really in my wheelhouse.  How were you expecting to get girls?  That's a great question.  Because of the heavy music.  Yeah, I figured it would attract my fucking rebel.  Yeah.  Would distract the dandruff?  Because he was edgy.  You probably had bed bugs.  Do you know, I told you, I've looked back at that.  I used to see black bugs.  Uh-oh.  In my, for years, I thought they were summer beetles.  Summer beetles.  Black bugs.  Black bugs.  In your bed? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, I would see them occasionally, but they would usually be on the floor by the car,  but they might have been.  You were a dirty little kid.  No, this is just a 23-year-old living at home.  I literally, for years, saw black bugs, but in the summer, I would always keep my paperwork  piled up on the floor in front of the bed, and I would see occasionally a bunch of black  bugs on it, and I think they would be those.  Maybe they were bed bugs.  Your dandruffy, buggy kid.  That's why we were.  You know where they might have been bed bugs from?  What I used to have, wow, growing up, I would have my buddies come over. 
[01:11:30]  Tyler, Dion, I told you, the uncle and nephew, they were like the same age, and Darnell,  cousin.  And we were all black guys, and when they moved to Plainfield, they would come over  and spend the night, and four of us would stay in my room.  Like, two or three of us in the bed.  Honestly.  Was it a lockup?  Not homoerotic at all.  Two of us in the bed and two on the floor, and maybe one of them brought bed bugs, because  how else would I have gotten them?  Damn.  Did you used to bring prostitutes in?  No, this was way before those things.  Before.  I was a kid when this happened.  15, 14?  Did you like the breakdown here? 
[01:12:00]  When I was a kid.  Why are you making fun of this song?  It's still a good song.  I just don't like the chorus.  No, I'm not making fun of the song.  I'm making fun of Jim holding a boot box with this song, trying to impress girls.  Let the guitar go.  We got the new Van Halen album.  Someone mentioned Chinatown.  You want to just take a quick question?  Sure.  All right.  Chinatown.  Van Halen.  It's not a Van Halen record without Eddie Van Halen's aerobics.  Oh, boy.  So far, okay. 
[01:12:30]  Okay.  We'll be right back. 
[01:13:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:13:30]  I like his lower voice in this one.  Me.  Yeah.  I fucking like that, man.  I don't know.  It's not bad.  No, it's heavy, man.  It's really heavy.  It's pretty much where they left off.  Right?  Sounds like stuff they could have easily done if Sammy Hagar didn't come around.  I don't know.  Why?  Well, what? 
[01:14:00]  Roland and I pulled an opie and Anthony.  Oh.  What's that?  Stole it from the boss's office?  Sure did.  Damn.  You guys.  Damn.  We're supposed to play Chinatown.  Yeah.  We're supposed to play Chinatown.  We're supposed to play a giant winter hat.  You go through the drop ceiling like we did?  Wait, wait.  You're not supposed to play Chinatown.  Why not?  No, we can't.  It's fine.  Oh, let's help me get something cool.  No.  Whose copy is this?  Whoever sits with Rob.  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  You took it off of the boss's office mates.  Right off of the boss's desk.  This is crazy and wild. 
[01:14:30]  That's a good tune, Chinatown.  Whose copy is this?  That one?  The guy who has nothing to do with his radio show and would really like his CD back so  Travis doesn't have to buy him a new one.  He runs all the nation.  That thing's getting smashed.  He probably needs this alt-nation.  I do want to hear a little of the Twisted Sister 30 lyrics.  What the fuck is this cover?  I don't know.  I couldn't figure it out either.  Is that what it is?  Oh, okay.  I thought it was like a fucking Roman war helmet on its side. 
[01:15:00]  It's a Roman warrior home for the weekend.  Okay, cool.  Let's see if they thank me.  Probably not.  Can we hear some of the Twisted?  Yeah.  I want to hear some of the vocals.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, there's rats coming out of the equipment.  It's been a while.  Oh, the mic's all taped.  Stuffin' Dusty.  This is so bad.  But man, they're playing now.  He takes his hair out. 
[01:15:30]  Someone should have dusted.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  I don't like that one.  Oh.  And when we hit the stage, Lord, you never know. 
[01:16:00]  Thirdly came and went a long time ago.  Oh.  Oh.  We're right the 80s like we thought they would never end.  Oh, God.  We're right the 80s like we...  We didn't leave the house down like we didn't wait back when.  What?  Oh.  Because we can fight, we can go all night.  Still carry it up even more.  Thirdly came and went a long, long time ago.  Oh, no. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, my.  That's hokey, though.  I don't like hokeyness.  It's not, though.  I like the chorus.  The only lyric I didn't like is when I thought the lyric of...  There was one lyric I didn't like.  You never gave a damn about being over the hill.  No, about what was over the hill.  What was over the hill.  I don't like old rockers singing songs about being an old rocker.  The chorus is cool.  I can fucking write songs.  No, it's not.  Thirdly came and went a long time ago.  I kind of like that.  I don't know.  What are you going to do?  It's all right.  Can you do a little more?  I'm honest.  Come on.  Seriously, I'm kind of thinking that. 
[01:17:00]  Jimmy's late.  We admit it's all right.  I see another download on Jimmy.  It was fun.  I'll tell you one thing.  Come on.  I'm going to get Van Halen right now.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Oh, God.  It was a rocked out, knocked out, sold out show every time.  Know that.  Oh.  We were jukebox dreaming.  Every night we make our day.  Jukebox dreaming.  Burning through the night.  Headed by the promised land.  No, that is. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Come on.  But it came and went a long time ago.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  It's not all right.  It is.  It's not all right.  No.  Honestly, I am.  It's not all right.  It's not all right.  I'm sorry.  We'll part lost you right there.  It has the lyrical integrity of we're back and better than ever.  You didn't mind when they talked about the promised land and then he shoehorned in.  You know where that is. 
[01:18:00]  You know where that is.  And then he pulled his sunglasses down and looked over the top.  I didn't see that.  I was telling you.  Can I see that again?  It's a pussy.  It's a vagina.  I didn't see that because I was looking at.  That means we got to play it again.  Just that one part.  Let's play a little bit again.  He's talking about a vagina.  It was a rocked out, knocked out, sold out show every time. 
[01:18:30]  Know that.  Know that.  Know that.  Know that.  We were two bucks dreaming.  Every night we make our stand.  Yeah.  Burning through the night.  Headed for the promised land.  You know what that is.  Come on.  Come on.  I don't care for that part.  Come on.  You don't like when he pulled his sunglasses down and looked over the top of him?  And you know what that is.  I'm talking about pussy.  And I didn't like when each band member is like, they're doing his live stage shot, 
[01:19:00]  but then they'll cut to each band member doing something to camera or not on the stage.  And the one guy threw almost like a karate punch, but he's kind of fat.  He's 400 pounds now.  I still kind of, I'm digging the song.  I mean, I don't love it, but I like it.  I do.  It's not a good song.  It's not.  It already came and went a long, long time ago.  If you like that song, you got to start, get rid of those sweaters.  What's wrong with my fucking sweater?  I'm a Sweater Boy cutie.  It's influencing your music.  No, it's not.  You don't believe I'm a Sweater Boy cutie? 
[01:19:30]  Watch this.  T-A-A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A.  All right.  You guys got Black History Month because we're going on a break.  You got one?  You have it.  You have it.  Today's?  Yeah.  Oh, we should honor the guy in the parking lots.  The flash mob?  Yeah.  Oh, did I give away the joke?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Fuck.  I thought that was just a news story.  All right, we got a break with this.  Long, long time ago.  I've got a joke for you. Wait, this is about the Jews that own the bar?  Yeah.  For Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony show recognizes some of the individuals 
[01:20:00]  whose contributions have shaped the African-American community  and changed all of us for the better.  Today, we recognize the flash mob.  For years, the African-American community traveled peacefully as individuals.  It wasn't until the flash mob that individuals could finally unite,  and looting became a team sport.  Police in Philadelphia say it's becoming a disturbing trend.  Young people using social media outlets and text messages 
[01:20:30]  to arrange large gatherings on the city streets.  A crowd of young people swarmed a convenience store  and in a matter of three and a half minutes,  walked out with $600 in stolen merchandise.  Take a look at this surveillance video.  It's from inside of Dunkin' Donuts.  You see a group of young men and young women lifting up and slamming down chairs,  pushing past the counter to grab donuts,  and ripping open a refrigerator door, then pulling out drinks.  Forty people rushed into the 69th Street store, grabbed anything they could carry. 
[01:21:00]  Officers arrested 15 juveniles and one 19-year-old, all from West Philadelphia.  Thank you, the flash mob.  Without you, we'd still be stuck for paying for things.  Stay tuned as we continue to recognize significant African-American contributions  for Black History Month, here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, now, this is D.L. Hughley.  Hey, this is Brewery.  Hey, everybody, it's Joel McHale.  Hi, this is Jim Jeffries.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:21:30]  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Sure.  Hey, there's a video on YouTube that's getting a lot of attention.  It's called Facebook Parenting for the Troubled Teen.  This thing has 30, almost 40,000 likes in less than 24 hours.  This fucking video has taken off.  It's a father talking to his daughter.  He just sets up a chair in the yard.  An uncomfortable wooden chair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a name for those chairs. 
[01:22:00]  I've sat on fists that were more comfortable.  Is it an Adirondack or something like that?  Oh, Adirondack chair.  Yes, I think you're right.  Where your butt goes all the way down to the bottom of the base of the chair.  Yeah, and then your legs are way up in the air.  Supposedly it's supposed to be comfortable for me properly.  You know what?  I can see that.  I hate those chairs.  When I shit, can I have that thing to put my feet up on?  There's something natural about your intestines being on that weird angle.  There is something natural about that.  Yeah.  Like you're in a fucking mercury capsule.  Or in a womb, yeah.  Well, how about he places the chair in the yard, you know, evenly? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, it's on a little hill.  It's a little.  He's kind of leaning.  He's listening to the right.  Well, let's see if this video is worth playing.  This guy sits down with a cigarette manifesto.  Good afternoon.  It's a piece of paper.  February 7, 2012.  This is for my daughter, Hannah.  And more importantly for all her friends on Facebook who thought that her little rebellious post was cute.  Oh, boy.  And for all you parents out there that think your, you know, kids don't post bad things on Facebook, well, I want to read you one. 
[01:23:00]  I took off my daughter's Facebook wall.  And she thought she'd be smart by blocking her parents and being able to see it.  Hannah, you were grounded for about three months for doing something very similar to this.  And I would have thought with a father that worked in IT for a living, you'd have better sense than to do it again.  But I just spent about six hours yesterday fixing your computer for you, upgrading it for you, spent about $130 on software. 
[01:23:30]  And today I run across a post on your Facebook page that you didn't think I'd be able to see.  So since you want to hide it from everyone, I'm going to share it with everybody.  This is called To My Parents, by the way.  To my parents, I'm not your damn slave.  It's not my responsibility to clean up your shit.  We have a cleaning lady for a reason.  Her name is Linda, not Hannah.  If you want coffee, get off your ass and make it yourself. 
[01:24:00]  If you want a garden, shovel the fertilizer yourself.  Don't sit back on your ass and watch me do it.  If you walk in the house and get mud all over the floor that I just cleaned, be my guest.  But clean it up after you're done getting shit everywhere.  I'm tired of picking up after you.  You tell me at least once a day that I need to get a job.  I love this part.  You could just pay me for all the shit that I do around the house.  Seriously? 
[01:24:30]  Are you kidding me?  This guy's a hoot.  Every day when I get home from school, I have to do dishes, clean the countertops, all the floors, make all the beds, do the laundry, and get the trash.  I'm not even going to mention all the work I do around your clinic.  And if I don't do all that every day, I get grounded.  You know how hard it is to keep up with chores and schoolwork?  It's freaking crazy.  I go to sleep at 10 every night because I'm too tired to stay up any longer and do anything else. 
[01:25:00]  I have to get up at 5 in the morning to get ready for school.  On the weekends, I have to sleep with my door locked so my little brother won't come get me up at 6.  That part's true.  This is all true.  This is what she's saying.  And I'm tired of this bullshit.  Next time I have to pour a cup of coffee, I'm going to flip shit.  I have no idea how I have a life.  I'm going to hate to see the day when you get too old to wipe your ass and you call me asking for help.  I won't be there.  Signed, you're pissed kid. 
[01:25:30]  Hannah.  I'm going to dress a couple of these.  Oh, boy.  We have a lady that cleans the house for us as a favor to trade off some services.  She is not, and you will never again refer to her as a cleaning lady.  That lady works harder in one day than you ever have in your life.  Pay you for the chores.  Seriously?  Pay you for chores that you're supposed to do around the house. 
[01:26:00]  You come home from school.  You have a list of chores that are on the wall because you can't remember them.  If you don't.  They are.  Sweep the living room and kitchen floor, which total will take you about three minutes.  If the countertops are dirty, wipe them down, which takes about a minute.  If the dishwasher is full and been run, empty it and put the dishes away.  If it's not, just be sure all the glasses and stuff are in the dishwasher. 
[01:26:30]  If you have any laundry of your own, do it.  And if your bed is unmade, do it.  Never understood making sure.  You don't have to do my laundry.  You don't have to make my bed.  You don't have to make the guest bed.  You have to make your own bed.  Once a month or so, I guess you probably have to make the guest bed.  But, um, pay you for chores?  Are you out of your mind?  He really doesn't like that one.  You're 15 going on 16 years old.  You want things for your laptop.  You want a new battery. 
[01:27:00]  You want a new cord.  You want a new camera.  You want a new phone.  You want a new iPod.  But you won't get off your lazy ass to get, to even look for a job.  The only job that you've applied to is the one I made you apply to because I got the application for you.  The, um, and you've been too lazy to even carry that back.  When I was your age, I had moved out of the house, lived on my own, went to college while in high school,  worked two jobs, was a volunteer fireman, and still went to school. 
[01:27:30]  Your responsibilities include waking up on time and getting on the bus.  That's the end of your response.  That's the ability each day.  You don't have the heart of life.  But you're about to.  Uh-oh.  I warned you months ago about, uh, what would happen if you did something like this on Facebook again.  The last time you were grounded, and quite frankly, I've forgotten now, but it was for something fairly childish and stupid.  Um, you know, we took away the computer, that kind of thing. 
[01:28:00]  No cell phone, no Facebook.  Um, and I told you, if it ever happened again, that it'd be a lot worse.  And I was really close that day to putting a bullet for your laptop.  Now, this time, I just spent all day yesterday, blew half of my day, upgrading your laptop, putting new software on it.  Um, spent about $130 in software to get everything, you know, the way that you wanted to have it for school. 
[01:28:30]  Um, you don't have to worry about buying a new laptop battery.  You don't have to worry about buying a new power cord.  You don't have to worry about buying a new camera.  Because you won't be using any of them until probably college.  Um, I don't know how to say how disappointed I am in you.  And how disrespectful you were to every single adult in your life. 
[01:29:00]  But kid, you got it easy.  Way easy.  Today, it's about to get harder.  It's about to get a whole lot harder.  It's like a wrestler working a mic.  Because you're not going to see this.  And for all I know, you might not ever see it.  But as soon as I'm done, I'm going to post this on your Facebook wall.  So all those kids that thought it was cool for how rebellious you were can see what happens.  And all the parents may get an idea to put a boot up their own kid's ass.  Because all this, there was more curse words in that one post. 
[01:29:30]  Just ridiculous.  Not happening.  Disrespectful to me, your mother, your stepmother, your family, your friends, and yourself.  So, I'm going to put a stop to it.  And I'm going to put a stop to it right now.  Oh boy.  That right there is your laptop.  Oh no.  You see it's out here on the ground.  This right here is my .45. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, that is.  That was the first round.  These are exploding hollow point rounds.  He's plugging the laptop.  Yeah, and you have to pay back for these two because these are about a dollar a piece.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  Oh yeah.  And after that comment you made about your mom, your mom told me to be sure I put one in there for her.  So, that one's from her.  And if I got one left.  It's a psychopath.  I got two left. 
[01:30:30]  Now I'm out.  So, just for the record, whenever you're not grounded, whenever year that happens to be,  you can have a new laptop when you buy a new laptop.  And when you pay me back the $130 for the software I spent on yours yesterday.  Hope you've enjoyed your little fiasco on Facebook.  Hope it was worth all this.  Have a good day, y'all.  So, damn. 
[01:31:00]  Now, I got a question, Ant.  Yeah.  During the video, you see all the cars driving by in the background and now he's shooting a gun?  How legal is that?  I don't know.  It depends on what state he's in.  Yeah.  It looks like it could be from Texas.  Yeah.  You know, you could probably just charge it on your property.  Yeah.  Who knows?  Wow.  Wow.  This guy means business.  Yeah, he does.  But he's a real...  I like what he was doing.  But he's a real dick. 
[01:31:30]  Psychopath.  Yeah, because...  I know what she did is...  It's kind of shitty to post that.  I understand a parent being really annoyed.  But a certain amount of rebellion is okay.  And I'm not a parent.  But it's almost like she...  As long as she's not doing drugs or drinking or fucking guy...  Yeah, she was just like, yeah, that is typical teen shit.  Like, I don't want to clean up.  I don't want to do this.  Like, it's like you're calling her out just for showing off in front of her friends.  Like, why wouldn't you just let her do that? 
[01:32:00]  Like, she obviously didn't want you to see it.  Yeah.  So, that to me says...  She's just talking shit to her stupid teenage friends.  Yeah.  Why are you talking to her like she's another adult?  Like, why are you embarrassed by what...  Like, maybe I would feel different if I was a parent, but...  I think he's just being a complete dick.  I think he's over the top over there.  Yeah.  Yeah, because she's not saying, I'm going to sleep with this guy.  He's 30.  I'm going to go out and get high.  Or...  That, I would understand.  Yeah.  But, I think he's just being a jack-off to shoot her laptop. 
[01:32:30]  It's a good dude.  Ah, ha.  There you have it.  Yeah.  That video is doing very well today.  But it's like, alright, your daughter was being a snot on Facebook.  She's 15.  Yeah.  That's the way it is now with social networking.  Yeah.  She's being a snotty 15-year-old.  So, what do you want to out-humiliate her?  And like prove...  Yeah, that's pretty much all he was doing.  Oh, what?  Oh, you're smarter than your 15-year-old?  No shit, dummy.  She's irrational.  No shit.  And again, I'm not talking as a parent, so I know that parents might think... 
[01:33:00]  Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about, but...  I think kids that age expect everything, too.  They don't expect to work.  We all worked when we were growing up.  We either...  We had jobs.  We had chores.  We had a little job on the side, and then we had chores at home.  Chores.  Yeah.  Sucked.  And a lot of these kids coming up today seem a bit entitled.  And if that guy came up drastically different, it probably is really frustrating to him.  Yeah, but shooting her laptop.  It was a little over the top.  It was either that or sledgehammer it or throw in the garbage. 
[01:33:30]  He went for the...  Yeah, a little sensationalism there.  He knew the video would do well.  Oh, yeah.  So he's aware of what social networking can do.  Yeah, anytime you blast rounds off into something like that, it's going to get some views.  Sure.  Yeah.  I think he's kind of coming off as a bit of an asshole.  Yeah, he does.  Definitely.  Because, again, you're calling out a 15-year-old and being snotty.  The fact that she has you blocked, it's not saying you shouldn't monitor her page, but if she's just talking shit to her friends, let her just talk shit to her friends. 
[01:34:00]  It's like, you know, do you have to, do you have to, in front of her friends, I don't know, maybe you do, I don't know.  It's hard for me to say without being a parent.  He's going to be sitting in that chair someday.  She's going to come up behind him with that same gun and just blow his brains out.  Or do you want her rebelling for real?  Oh, boy.  Like, if that's her idea of being...  You know what the rebellion would be that would really get to him, Jim?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  In person.  Do you really want her, like, to me, if that's the extent of it, her just being a fucking brat about her chores, make the video. 
[01:34:30]  And it was actually entertaining at one point, but then it got like, all right, you're really trying to...  Yeah.  We know you're smarter than her.  We know that.  You're her father.  Or call her lazy, make fun of her.  Maybe she just really annoys the piss out of him walking around in her underwear.  Yeah, maybe.  Her bra.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Daddy, shut up.  And she's like, oh, boy, look, she's wearing a new Victoria's Secret shit around the house. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  There's nothing worse than a non-parent saying what it's...  I know that.  For parents, that must be annoying.  Yeah.  Does anybody have any...  Well, the phones are lit, but...  They agree with the guy?  I don't know.  They're not...  Who's answering the phone?  What's happening today?  We were calling the guy in North Carolina to try to get him on the phone.  Oh, it's North Carolina?  Yeah.  What are the gun laws in North Carolina?  That legal with the cars going by in the background?  They don't have any.  Oh, okay.  No laws.  You can just shoot whatever you want, wherever you want. 
[01:35:30]  Really?  No, there's...  I'm sure there's some town ordinance, but...  Jimmy is missing the point.  We got Bryce in Montana.  Bryce, you're on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, Jimmy, maybe I'm fucked up because I got two little girls that I imagine I'll probably  be hearing a lot of the same shit before too long.  One six and one nine if I got a little bit.  But he also says that...  He says in the video that he's...  He said he's making a lot worse the next time.  So it's not like this is the first time it happened. 
[01:36:00]  Right.  So she was calling his boss, and she got caught.  Now in a year, or in five months, or whatever, she straightens up her shit, and he might get  her another laptop.  But you don't tell her that now.  Let me ask you a question.  And this is where I have...  Because it's a social networking thing.  It's the equivalent of...  Yeah, I would say just a bullshitting with your friends.  So it's almost like...  Well, she humiliated her father because she was talking shit, and all her friends could 
[01:36:30]  see it, knowing that the father can't see this shit.  But that's kind of the point.  Like, that's kind of what teenagers do.  Yeah.  But I guess he figures their families can see it too, and...  Well, it's humiliating, I would assume.  Well, if this is...  She took her chance, and she loses because he's an IT guy, and he found the message.  Well, I look at it this way.  I kind of...  I was a fucked up kid.  If my kids do half this shit, I thought I'd just say, fuck it, do whatever you want, 
[01:37:00]  because there's no way I could deal with it, probably.  But I was going out and getting shit-faced at 13, 14, and fucking off all the time.  And once I could get away with a little bit, you know, my old man bought me a car before  I had a license.  Well, I figured out, as long as I wash the fucker every day when I got home and zeroed  out the miles and put a couple gallons in it, he never fucking noticed.  Well, pretty soon I got punched in the mouth a couple times, because he found out from  people I was driving it all over town.  You get away with a little more, and a little more, and a little more.  I only got a little kid, but the older parents out there, I can't imagine how you deal with 
[01:37:30]  it.  We see it just from the interns that come through.  There's an entitlement now.  Like, we worked our balls off growing up.  Whether, like I said, chores, or you had to get a little job to, you know, pay for your  own shit, or maybe, in my case, donate to the household.  And it seems like kids these days don't have to do any of that crap.  You're Danny Noonan.  I had to put my money in the fucking cookie jar, that's for sure.  And it was all my caddy money, so yeah, I guess I was that guy.  Caddy.  So.  I do it as a parent, and see how I'm doing it sometimes, but you want to spoil your kids 
[01:38:00]  a little bit.  Right.  And you always want them to have a little more.  But then, and then when you come down and you decide to teach them a little something,  and there's just, I mean, my girl, my oldest girl's only nine, but if I tell her she has  to pay for something herself, she's got like $800 rat holding her room and she's nine.  I'm like, well, you, so you got to pay for something for $10 bucks, and she's just devastated.  Yeah.  We paid for everything growing up.  Fuck, I never got money off my parents. 
[01:38:30]  Fuck.  It's like, they get an allowance, and they don't have any fucking chores yet.  They're six to nine, and it's like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  We got paid for chores, though, I guess.  A little bit, right?  I had an allowance.  A little pittance.  An allowance.  Nope.  Let's go to, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Dr. Nighthawk.  Dr. Nighthawk.  Dr. Nighthawk.  Opie, you are 100% right.  There is a sense of entitlement, and Jim, if she wants to talk shit to her friends, that's 
[01:39:00]  one thing.  But now, it's on video only forever.  It's there.  The delivery there.  That's a reflection on the parent.  Well, she didn't do it on video.  She wrote it.  But yeah, that's true.  It is out there for everyone to see.  Yeah, forever.  And, you know, what did I raise this child to be this way?  It's kind of a reflection on the parent.  And, you know, there's a sense of, shucks, I wish I had done a better job.  Let's stop this while it's going now, and let's put a stop to it, and let's start correcting 
[01:39:30]  the wrong.  Well, I do agree with Jimmy a little bit that it didn't seem like her behavior was that  completely out of control.  Yeah, she was just being, to me, she was just being, and I'm not even 100% committed to  my point, it seemed like she was just being kind of a snotty teenager, not, like, really  fucked up.  Like, you know, when you see what people do now, they're fucking and getting knocked up,  and, like, to her just being a brat on Facebook is like, bleh.  Yeah, it could have been 100,000% worse.  That's correct.  But maybe he wants to put a stop to it so it doesn't get there. 
[01:40:00]  Let's go to Kerry in New York, who agrees with?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  That's right.  No, I'm sorry.  I don't agree with Jimmy.  Okay.  Well, that's why I went to you, because I'm trying to balance this shit.  That's okay.  If they all disagree, maybe they're right.  It did say agree, and now they change it to disagree, Jimmy.  Okay, Matt, go ahead, Kerry.  I disagree.  I have a 15-year-old son.  His second week in popcorn high school, he was drinking with his friends.  Oh, boy.  A girlfriend came to my house, knocked on the door, and told me he's drunk at the Dunkin' 
[01:40:30]  Donuts.  So this is stuff going on that I didn't even know about.  So I wish I had known I would have taken a shotgun to his iPod.  Shotgun to his what?  Why?  His iPod.  And he works one day a week with his father.  He has his own bank account, but then he takes money out, and he gets charged $35, because  he doesn't have the check.  It's not deposited yet.  On a $20 ATM withdrawal.  Oh, boy.  A 15-year-old should be more responsible with their checking accounts.  Yeah.  You got to be real here. 
[01:41:00]  They're not going to be responsible with checking accounts.  Yeah, miss, please.  And our names are on it, so it reflects on us.  And that's just, you know, that was just one thing he did.  Then it's the grades, and before you know it, and unfortunately, he's just like his mother.  It's a 15-year-old.  What are you expecting?  They're retarded.  No, I didn't.  But if you don't stop it now?  No, if you don't stop it now, they normally kind of grow up and realize, wow, that's kind  of fucked up.  But, you know, people are trying to treat 15-year-olds like they're fucking adults. 
[01:41:30]  217.  Or something.  Something like that?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know that, lady.  Let's go to Bill in Ohio.  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  Good morning, boys.  Hi, buddy.  You know, Opie is right in that kids today feel entitled.  My wife has a 15-year-old brother, and he sits on his butt in his bedroom playing video  games all day, where I, at 16, I was working a job 30 hours a week and going to school and 
[01:42:00]  everything.  My wife had two jobs when she was 16.  And just the kids today are so lazy and stuff, and I could just hear it in that frustration.  But didn't your, can I ask you, didn't your parents say that about you?  It is the generational thing.  I'm not working 30 hours a week, and while going to school and getting A's in school.  No, but they...  I was going to bed around the clock at night.  This goes back to walking to school in the snow.  This is the same old shit that you used to make fun of. 
[01:42:30]  Every generation.  Every generation has their own misery that the newer generation doesn't understand.  It's...  I'm sorry.  My brother-in-law is a lazy fuck.  And my wife has even said that.  He is lazy.  I assume that it would be just tough to tell your 14, 15-year-old that they have to get  a job in this day and age.  My dad told me to go get a job because I wanted stuff.  And he's like, no, you want it, you pay for it.  So I went out and got a job. 
[01:43:00]  And I worked 30 hours a week.  But it goes to A's point.  It's a generational thing.  Yeah.  We get what we...  Hold on, sir.  We get what we had to do growing up.  And obviously they're doing it differently, these kids today.  And that's where the frustration comes in.  He wants stuff, too.  And unfortunately, her mom just gives him the money or whatever.  And so he's extremely overweight.  He's lazy.  And he had a job.  Yeah, but he's been getting here earlier. 
[01:43:30]  I mean, there's no...  We're trying, Mr. Nagel.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  He's gotten better.  Oh, I knew that was coming.  He's been out for three weeks.  All right.  He complained about it.  All right, already.  Jesus, this guy.  You made your point.  Right.  We did find someone that agrees with Jimmy.  Let me see what Murph in Georgia has.  And, Murph, by the way, Jim Norton's coming to Atlanta soon.  I know that.  I'm looking forward to it.  I need to get tickets today.  Next weekend, buddy.  You better.  That damn thing's going to sell out. 
[01:44:00]  Right, Jimmy?  Artistically, yes.  Hey, Jimmy.  I didn't know about it until yesterday.  I'm getting the tickets today.  I can't wait.  Cool, buddy.  But anyway, Jimmy, dude, you could not be more right.  I'm a father of two, and I'm listening to these whiny little bitches talk about their kids  and their brother-in-law.  Shut up.  You know, it starts when they're four and two, like my kids are.  It starts with respect, and, you know, it goes on until this asshole has a 15-year-old  daughter, and he's being a prick on YouTube, shooting her left back. 
[01:44:30]  She can't even watch it.  I know.  He kind of teased her that she's not going to be able to watch it, but certainly one of  her friends will show her.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hence, that guy better sleep with one eye open.  I want to make this real quick, because I'm nerving out.  Yeah, I'll talk to you guys.  No, you're all right.  No, you're good.  Say what you got ahead, by the way.  Yeah, you're good.  Jimmy, you're so right, and these whiny frickin' parents, they piss me off because they're 
[01:45:00]  doing a horrible job, and then they get frustrated when their kids are-  You said all that already.  Yeah, you're just nervously repeating yourself.  We should have hung up.  You're panicking, sir.  Hi, Murph.  Thank you, Murph.  Any young girls, though, that have had their laptops taken away and shit like that, I  have plenty of laptops over my house, and I don't judge.  So, I'm just putting that out there.  Let's go to Jeff in Georgia.  Yeah, hey, you guys got to walk a mile in his parents' shoes.  I got two-  Boots. 
[01:45:30]  Where are we going?  15, 14.  I wouldn't walk.  Can I walk a half a mile and then come back a half a mile?  Yeah, boots hurt my ankles, sir.  Or else I'd have to walk two miles just to get back home.  Yeah, that's a lot of walks.  So, it's a half a mile there and a half a mile back.  Come on!  Come on!  Come on, these douchebags to lick my ballsack!  Come on!  Go, Jimmy!  Happy birthday!  Go see Jimmy when he's down in Atlanta.  Birthday. 
[01:46:00]  That was a twofer from Georgia right there.  Nice.  We're tapping into that Georgia market.  Yeah, that's really good down there.  Hell yeah.  That's what made the phones fucking go crazy today.  Whatever.  They're still ringing.  I guess people made their points.  Yeah, people have strong feelings.  It is a generational thing.  We just remember things differently.  I don't think she was doing anything that crazy.  That's what I'm saying.  But again, it is out there forever and it is-  But she hid it.  Yeah.  No matter if-  When we were hiding shit growing up and our parents found out, they got fucking pissed. 
[01:46:30]  Right?  Bringing out your gun and shooting her shit pissed should be saved for like,  you found out she was drinking or drugging or fucking sucking dick or something.  But like, she just posted some whiny kid shit.  Yeah.  There was nothing in there that was exceptional in any way.  Nothing threatening.  Nothing-  It was just a pissed off kid that doesn't want to clean her room and fucking do her chores.  That's every kid.  So, you know, maybe he's around the house. 
[01:47:00]  She's really a cunt or something.  I don't know.  But just for that, I think he overreacted.  Well, after watching the video, it's obvious she's acting just like the father.  So, we know where she learned it from.  Learned it from you, okay?  Because now he's grandstanding and showing this off to his friends.  Like, look what I did.  This is how you pair it.  Right?  The wife should make a video.  You know, my husband made a video here and it was very embarrassing.  Right.  He should have handled it behind closed doors, I guess. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  And he shot the laptop and then she'll take a shot, but it's from a larger gentleman.  Right.  On her chin.  Yes.  That'll end up online.  Yes, it will.  Here, Daddy.  Here it is.  Hope you find this video, Daddy.  And she's just there at a gangbang.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Fucking a black guy in a cowboy hat.  Oh, yeah.  And he's doing that fucking slappy video.  Ah, an alien!  Ah!  What is that?  Oh.  Oh.  Sorry.  Who was it?  Just an alien floated by. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, Egghead.  Egg.  What's that, Egghead?  Oh, my.  All right.  We got a break again to sell more shit.  Oh, my God.  Trying to sell more shit.  William Shatner's coming in in a little bit.  Yes.  And when we get back, we got to do the parking lot altercation, finally.  Oh, yeah.  That you told me about on the way home yesterday, Jimmy.  I think that's a good one.  And we got the Rock saying bullshit on SportsCenter.  What the fuck's going on?  That's right.  If you smell what the Rock's cooking.  Well, you know, the comedy he likes is harsh.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  What comedy is that?  I don't know.  Yes, I do.  What does he like?  I don't know.  Yes, I do.  I'm not fucking doing it.  What does the Rock like?  S-B-C.  S-B-C.  Yeah.  What are we doing?  I was sounding out.  Sirius XM. 
[01:49:00]  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  Do, do, do, do.  We got William Shatner coming in in about a half hour.  Yes, I have very important things to ask Bill.  You do?  Bill Shatner, yeah.  Like what?  You know, it's about a nightmare at 20,000 feet.  Ah.  Highlight Zone episode.  Yeah, I got a couple of questions there.  Ah.  Watching it during one of the marathons, and something really bothered me.  Maybe he can help out.  He's always been very enlightening when I bring up past TV shows he's been in, as far as enlightening us. 
[01:49:30]  He hates it.  Does he?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't realize that.  He hates it.  Shatner's World on Broadway.  Yes.  Yuck.  What do you mean yuck?  Oh, is that what he's promoting?  It's his one-man show.  It's amazing.  Is it amazing?  He's a renaissance man.  Sounds awful.  He's talking about his career.  It sounds awful.  Why doesn't he just talk about his career on our show?  Why do you have to go to Broadway?  Because they know he's going to buy tickets for our show.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Can you still smell what's cooking after all these years? 
[01:50:00]  I can, in fact, yes.  What's it smell like?  Right now.  Beef and cheese?  No.  Settle down, please.  I'm going to tell you.  It smells like black and Chilean sea bass with mango on the side.  All right.  How about that?  Sounds good.  And we haven't found a gym yet, right?  We haven't found a gym yet.  Let's wait for you.  And this is live, by the way.  It's real live.  Oh, we just said bullshit.  Yeah, you're playing the sound effect.  Oh, and that was the whole reason we were playing that?  That's right.  Oh, where was that?  Whoops. 
[01:50:30]  It was right when you were playing the sound effect.  How long ago?  How long ago?  A little bit.  Fuck!  So where do I go?  Back in 10 seconds.  I say back to the beginning.  Can you still smell what's happening here?  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  You should have just played the clip.  All right.  How about that?  Sounds good.  That's bullshit.  We haven't found a gym yet, right?  We haven't found a gym yet.  Let's wait for you.  And this is live, by the way.  It's real live.  We'll fix it.  So The Rock says bullshit.  Who cares?  Bullshit.  Wow.  What channel is it on?  The children.  It's cable. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, please.  Who cares?  That is a not.  That shouldn't even be an issue or a story or nothing.  That's just a guy saying a word.  Are we getting The Rock?  No.  He's not doing serious.  He's not doing any radio.  We said yes to The Rock.  I know.  He said no to radio.  Oh.  Last time I talked to him, not only did he say the F word, but he told me who his favorite  comedian was.  Jimmy Norton?  I didn't say his favorite.  He likes Jimmy Norton, but he won't come in and do the show?  Well, I don't know.  His proporcist probably just said no radio. 
[01:51:30]  I'm sure he would if he knew, but yeah.  But we're radio.  Right.  That means he's saying no to us.  He's a fan of Jim's.  All right.  We're on bad terms with The Rock again.  Let's just let him know I'm a part of the show.  He might not know.  He might want to wait for him until I'm here.  Oh, maybe.  Let him know I'm part of the show.  I'll bring in the Hollywood celebrities.  You will, Jimmy.  You will.  Yeah, I'll bring him on.  You think The Rock and CM Punk sit together and watch your tapes?  Oh.  I guess.  It would be my one day.  Yeah.  That's so cool.  You like that?  What's this parking lot altercation? 
[01:52:00]  Large black guy, very angry at a white guy.  And the black guy's with his girlfriend or I think, I don't know what their relationship  is.  And apparently what happened was one guy, what I found out was they were both going for  the same parking spot.  So I'm going to say that the white guy was probably waiting to do it.  And the black guy looks kind of thuggish and gangster.  He probably just cut in and, you know, jumped in front of him. 
[01:52:30]  Right.  And the black guy, when the white guy walked by later, he threw some kind of a coffee on  the black guy's car.  Oh, boy.  And the black guy saw it and is following him now to his car to make him get a towel to  clean his car.  Oh, man.  So I don't know how this will play on radio.  Maybe terribly.  I don't know.  Well, I got a few clips.  Because how long is this video?  Seven minutes, but it goes into a rap song at one point.  I don't know why whoever did the video covers it.  So we can, like, skip around if we just use the video portion? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, but it's just worth it to hear a little bit of the yelling.  Why does he call him a nigga? 
[01:53:30]  And then the volume drops out.  See the white guy wiping his car off.  Oh, man.  Wait.  Is that someone breathing?  What's wrong?  I don't remember that being all that breathing in there.  Maybe it was there and I just didn't notice it, so.  This guy is now wiping down the black guy's vehicle.  And it seems really unreasonable.  But he threw the coffee on the car. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, he did.  And he got caught.  That's what you learned.  Yeah, he threw.  You got to make sure no one's looking.  Yeah.  Fucking the white.  Can you just leave me quiet and wipe the car, please?  I'm wiping it.  I'm wiping it right now.  Dang.  Well, if somebody does nothing to my car, I'd have been pissed.  Man, I said fuck, man.  This guy is scared shitless.  Oh, shit.  I'm wiping it right now.  I got paper towels.  Give me a bottle.  They'll drink the stuff.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  I said fuck, man.  Stop talking to wipe my whole this shit. 
[01:54:30]  No point.  No point.  Can I see your phone?  I'll tell you what I'm doing.  I'm wiping it right now, Kevin.  Wipe this shit.  Wipe this shit.  Wipe this shit.  Wipe this shit.  Then I'm going to give you money to get it detailed.  I'm going to give you cash to get it detailed.  Holy shit.  He is petrified.  He does not want that big black guy to punch him in the face.  And he really.  And that guy, if you see that big guy pointing, his fucking forearm, that is a worked out forearm.  And the guy, the black guy is getting right in his face and screaming, but he's not. 
[01:55:00]  We discussed the video on the way home yesterday, and I think that this guy might be on parole or something.  That could be perceived as a threat.  Oh, he is threatening him.  But he's not.  A physical threat.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  But he's not hitting him.  It doesn't matter.  No, no, but he's right to be pissed off, and he wants his shit cleaned off.  Oh, it is right to be pissed off, but let me tell you, you could use some force back at that black guy just on the way he's acting.  You could.  Oh, yeah.  But it's funny to see this guy. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, this guy's just a cowering, scared white boy.  But the way he's trying, I love the way he keeps trying to go, you know, no, no, I'd be pissed too.  Yes, sir, I'd be pissed too.  I'll shine it up for you.  What do you need?  Dick sucked.  You got it.  Wimp it out.  He just keeps trying.  Yeah.  To connect.  Oh, man.  And the girlfriend knows that her boyfriend or whatever has a fucking rage issue going.  And then he tries to play, because he tries to get him to squirt.  Because I guess the coffee is, or the mocha drink is drying.  Yeah, yeah.  Which makes it harder to clean.  The sugar.  Yeah.  The sugar is drying. 
[01:56:00]  Don't give me a wipe this shit, four niggas.  You ain't gonna wipe your bitch ass.  You ain't gonna wipe your bitch ass.  Wipe this shit.  I'll give you money to get detailed.  All right.  I'll give you money to get detailed.  I understand.  Just leave.  Yeah, you ain't gonna wipe your fucking ass.  Wipe this shit.  Wipe it, man.  Money to get detailed as well.  As well.  Just don't shoot me, sir.  Oh, you're gonna need that true coat.  Just don't kill me, sir. 
[01:56:30]  If you would, like, spray the windshield.  We don't give you this shit detailed, too.  Wipe this shit.  Wipe this shit.  Stop talking to me.  Wipe this shit.  Stop talking to me and wipe.  Wipe this shit.  Wipe this shit.  You could spray this.  It would help.  Can you just stop talking to Jess?  Wipe the fucking car.  If you could spray it, it would help.  Just please, sir.  You can please.  This woman's like, look, you aren't gonna get your ass beat.  Yeah, because she's getting in between the two.  She's begging him to just shut up, please.  She knows what he's capable of doing. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, she's seen some shit.  Please calm down, bro.  Just calm, bro.  Calm, calm.  See, she is trying to help.  Hello, hello.  There's a parking spot right here, and this man tried to get it, and we seen it first.  And we seen it first.  She's on the phone explaining what happened.  We seen it first.  We seen it first.  Now, the security guy's pulling up.  I thought he stole my spot.  The white man out here, he had put water out on the car, girl. 
[01:57:30]  I was a dick.  I was weird.  Oh, he pulled his car.  I said, slump the bitch, asshole.  Yeah, he got married.  They gave my man, honey, man.  What you gonna talk about?  They gave my man.  That's a bitch, asshole.  They're telling him to give him away the owner.  They're telling him to give him away the owner.  They're telling him to give him away the owner.  They're telling him to give him away the owner.  Give him away the owner.  Hey, go away, please.  He wants some money.  I'm trying to.  He won't calm down, because he is fucking mad. 
[01:58:00]  I'll be mad, too.  Gay my money.  I don't give a fuck.  Get in, Timmy.  Now he wants money.  Now he heard money.  Black my shit, girl.  Black my shit.  You're struggling.  Good morning, good morning.  We got this motherfucker Perkins spot.  The Perkins spot.  He get out of his motherfucking truck, come over here and call his motherfucking...  I'm telling you, huh.  Moco Choco, whatever the...  Moco Choco.  I'm the motherfucking car.  Yeah, but he's out here wiping his shit off.  He's going down, huh. 
[01:58:30]  He's going down, huh.  I'll be fucking down, huh.  He's driving back to his motherfucking man.  I'm trying to get down on him.  Why is a white guy running away right now?  First of all, running for his life.  White guy is not athletic enough.  No, white guy's a little chubby.  Plus his car's somewhere.  His car's probably right next to it or close by.  And that guy was funny because that guy's like,  you didn't think I watched your bitch ass?  You didn't think I watched your...  He just saw him do it.  He must have been like, 
[01:59:00]  that motherfucker here.  Oh no, he did!  And just was infuriated.  I'd be like, excuse me, I have some professional  cleaning fluids in my vehicle.  I will go there and come back and...  Just peel out, leave.  That guy, the guy would have stood behind his car.  Yeah.  And that guy...  You can see the black guy is also...  Because I'm a gangster.  He likes the attention of...  Like he's being angry and the girl's on the phone.  Oh yeah.  So it fuels you.  It's that drama that black people love so much.  Any argument you have.  No.  And he knows kind of technically he's in the right here. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  So he's got it locked.  So you ever argue with your chick and she admits she's wrong about something?  Like you got her so dead to rights and she's always right.  This guy is probably so used to being on the wrong end of it.  Yeah, yeah.  That when he finally justifiably has a guy, he is gonna fucking milk it.  He is gonna say wipe my shit 20 times.  Wipe my shit!  Wipe my shit!  I love the nervousness of the white guy.  Classic.  And I'm gonna...  We'll get a detail.  We're gonna get a detail for ya.  He's selling it.  I got paper towels. 
[02:00:00]  Got paper towels.  Get a detail.  But the guy...  That was dumb.  That was dumb on my part.  Dumb.  Very dumb.  I was a dick.  I sprayed the car.  I understand.  Oh boy.  But I'm amazed at the restraint this guy is showing and not hitting him.  Like this...  And believe me, this guy could get past his girlfriend if he wanted to.  The second that white guy would have done anything that wasn't the equivalent  of a dog tucking his tail between his legs and bowing to the alpha dog in the pack.  That motherfucker would have ripped his throat out.  You're probably right.  Yeah.  But he's still not ripping his throat out. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, because this guy is bowing to him.  But that...  Yes.  But he also did throw...  Throwing a mocha drink on a big black guy's car is punch in the face of folks.  Oh yeah, yeah.  You're right.  And he's not getting slugged for it.  And this guy wants to hit him.  He probably wants his shit wiped.  He does, but I'm wondering why is he not hitting him?  I'm amazed that he's obviously...  You could tell he's worked out if nothing else.  Yeah.  Is he on parole?  What the...  Is he afraid of killing this guy?  Maybe, yeah.  Because the girl getting involved makes you think, oh fuck, you know, this guy obviously 
[02:01:00]  could do some damage.  And who's filming?  I think it must be a third person that's with the black couple.  Yeah, yeah.  Or someone that just saw it.  I love these guys on Twitter.  I don't care how big someone is.  I would not put up with that shit.  Yeah, right.  And who the fuck is filming?  Of course you would put up with that shit.  I need to say that.  This guy's scared out of his mind.  He got caught.  He didn't plan...  I see myself in this position because he didn't plan on having a confrontation with  a guy who probably runs a gang in a prison yard.  All right. 
[02:01:30]  He's just going to the mall.  He didn't plan on getting caught.  Like, oh no.  Oh.  There's a little bit more.  He was hoping it was an old lady, a little old lady in the car.  I would figure out my odds if I could outrun the person.  You ain't not running that person.  And then at that point, I think I'm fucking cleaning his car, to be honest with you.  Oh, man.  Yeah, let's hear more of this.  Fuck 10.  Man, I ain't no need to be talking, man.  Just get in my seat.  What do you want him to do?  He want his car fucking clean.  I ain't no way she want to do it.  Get in my seat.  Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro.  Man, man.  Oh, you fuck.  Oh, you get out of here. 
[02:02:00]  I want to press charges.  I want to press charges.  I want to press charges.  I want to press charges.  What is coming?  Take your fucker out of jail.  They do it.  They do it.  I said, you want to shut your bitch's ass.  Fuck ass record.  You want him to sit down there, you're going to the right street, hoe.  Fuck your time back.  Let me show you how we do it down here in Georgia, baby.  Fuck your time back.  What?  He had no, we had no walk inside the mall, but Kevin was still standing right there.  I ain't no ain't no shit.  I ain't no ain't no shit.  I ain't no ain't no shit. 
[02:02:30]  I ain't no shit.  I ain't no shit.  Hold on, man.  I'm trying to stop that.  Hold on.  Bro, bro, come on.  He, he, he, he, he understood he's their fault.  Man, fuck that shit.  That whole nigga is the thing I'm watching.  White boy, that shit.  Yeah, he really did.  White boy, it's always about white boy and cracker.  Yeah.  Some nigga.  Right there.  The cops are plugged.  He turned the volume down.  He gets close to the guy and he kind of pokes at his head over the shoulder of the security  guard.  Yeah.  But he doesn't hit him.  But the cops are coming up.  Yeah, cops are running.  That would be hilarious. 
[02:03:00]  Just dump on the black guy.  Is that what they did?  They put him in cops.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  But they don't, they don't, they don't know.  They don't know.  They're just coming up to a scene.  They just see him yelling.  But it's amazing.  Here's what interested me.  Maybe I'm overanalyzing it.  But in the very beginning he goes, get his tag number.  Get his license number.  And then he's going, I want to press charges.  Yeah.  He likes the fact that he's on legally the right side.  The right side.  As the cops come and just put the cops on him immediately.  Even though he's being menacing in his world.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  That's not, I mean, he's menacing him, but he's not beating the shit out of him.  Yeah.  Am I overanalyzing this?  I would love to fucking hear from, I don't know, maybe there's no answer.  I don't know.  Is there an update to this?  I don't know.  His name is Kevin, obviously.  Somebody's got no info about the guy.  The woman saying Kevin was watching him, which is either the video guy or the...  The guy really didn't have a leg to stand on that he did dump the shit on the guy's car.  I mean, you know, if there was a situation where a black guy like that or anybody is yelling at you to that extent, and you didn't do anything, that would be five steps back and draw on him. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  And then just say, look, you know, you're threatening, you're menacing me, leave, leave the situation.  Lave.  Lave.  Lave.  Lave.  But that was a...  It's a very interesting thing that's happening there, because of the weird shit the black guy is saying, and he's not, he's not, and believe me, he could get by, he's a big dude.  I love white my shit.  White my shit!  That's so degrading. 
[02:04:30]  It's either humiliation, or you're fucking, you're sipping your beverages through a, your food through a fucking straw for six months.  Yeah.  You didn't notice the black guy did the gun thing to the white kid's temple too, right?  At the very end there?  With two fingers, he went like this and put it to the kid's head.  I don't take that as a gunshot threat.  That's more of a point.  No, I'm just saying it was in the video.  I didn't even notice it, to be honest with you.  Uh, uh, uh.  It was absolutely in the video.  But it was split along racial lines.  I loved how white guys were going, well, you know, he did something wrong and he acknowledged it. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  It's like that doesn't, the guy caught him, a guy who can beat your ass, who catches you throwing a mocha drink on his car.  Terrible.  This guy's saying, uh, the video's fake.  There's no fear in the white guy's voice.  Are you kidding me?  Shut up.  You don't know fear then.  He's like, okay, we'll get it detailed.  Yes, that was a bad move.  A world star hip hop doesn't have fucking, uh, fake videos.  That guy's terrified.  He absolutely is.  And you wouldn't write, by the way, if you're writing this, you wouldn't write. 
[02:05:30]  I was a dick.  I was a dick.  Yeah.  You wouldn't write that.  You'd write the guy more scared.  Yeah.  You would write him more scared.  He's holding, he's so scared he's maintaining.  Right.  He's petrified and he's just trying to keep from getting hit.  The way he goes like, yeah, we'll get it detailed and like they've already agreed to it.  You know?  And they're like, yeah, we'll get it detailed and everything will be good.  He's just saying whatever he can hoping something sinks in.  Wipe my shit!  Wipe my shit!  Wipe my shit just sounds like suck my dick.  It really does.  It really does. 
[02:06:00]  I wish we could get an update on this guy.  If we could have Travis or somebody search for it.  Yeah.  I'm really curious.  What happened here.  Who this guy is and what happened.  He's not quite epic beard man, is he?  No.  I would love to get an update.  I'm really curious.  Yeah, someone's got to know something.  Wipe my shit.  Someone's saying, ah, this guy or girl in New Mexico, Renee, I think.  What's up, Renee?  I'm not a girl, idiot.  It says Renee, idiot.  I don't care. 
[02:06:30]  Hey.  How the fuck do I know you're not a girl if it says Renee from New Mexico, you idiot?  What?  You got a girl's name, you dope.  And until I hear a man's voice, I'm going to assume it's a fucking lady.  Now what do you got for the show, idiot?  Well.  All right, idiot.  Hey, Anthony, did you actually say I'm going to take five steps back and draw?  Someone's going to take your gun from one of these and beat you in the head with it.  You hate shit.  Quit acting like you're a badass.  Ooh.  Wow.  Oh, really?  Really?  Why?  No doubt in my mind that somebody could disarm you, Anthony, and beat you in the head with 
[02:07:00]  your own gun.  Oh, really?  Really?  And how do you draw that conclusion, sir, just based on hearing me on the radio?  Well, I've seen you.  You're not very menacing at all, you know?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I'm not very menacing at all?  What does that mean?  Oh, wow.  What does that mean?  What does that have to do with being able to handle a firearm, sir?  Neither is Bernie Guts.  What does not being menacing have to do with handling a firearm?  You already admit you're a pussy, so I'm just saying, don't act like you're going 
[02:07:30]  to draw on somebody.  You're not.  If my life feels threatened, I absolutely would.  He wouldn't have been threatened at that point, though.  He wasn't threatening that guy.  That is a threat.  That is a perceived threat.  That is a perceived threat on your life.  It doesn't necessarily have to be actual physical contact.  Believe me.  I know all the deadly physical force laws, my friend.  I know you are cops.  We do this.  But that's a reason to draw a gun on somebody?  Because he's yelling at you? 
[02:08:00]  Not just yelling.  That guy was coming up.  He was very menacing.  Very menacing.  And could have at any moment been a deadly confrontation with that gentleman.  That wasn't deadly, Anthony.  See, that's what I'm saying.  You find that deadly.  That makes you a pussy.  Oh, shit!  That's it.  I'm a pussy.  Well, Renee.  Well, girl, cunt name.  You fucking...  You have fun.  Yeah, yeah.  You have fun, then, and think what you want, and jerk off to me being a pussy or whatever 
[02:08:30]  floats that boat of yours.  I'm gonna jerk off to you.  Yeah.  Well, obviously, you're fucking queer for me.  What's the matter?  You picture me, the little twink that can't handle himself.  Renee sweeps in and saves me.  Is that what would have happened?  You would have swept in and saved me, Renee?  Is that your fucking fantasy?  Your fucking queer fantasy?  Is that it, Renee?  Ugh.  You're disgusting.  Shut up.  You know nothing of me and nothing of being a real man. 
[02:09:00]  Go suck a dick, Renee.  Hey, Renee!  Bet that didn't cost you much in school.  How many times did you get punched in the face?  Hey, Renee!  Was there a girl in class that was also named Renee, and the teacher didn't know?  Which girl is Renee?  This guy.  Oh, that's me, and I'm a guy.  Ah, shut up, pussy.  Pussy.  Hang up.  What?  That's all you're doing is hanging up by not letting me speak, you fuck. 
[02:09:30]  You spoke already, pussy.  I'm a pussy, yeah.  Yeah, you are a pussy.  Fuck you, you fucking East Coast faggot.  Ah, now we're going to East Coast, West Coast.  You're not even West Coast.  You're New Mexico.  You're landlocked, you fucking fruit.  Shut up with your coast shit.  Coast.  A coast needs water.  Shut up.  New Mexico, really?  Oh, you're hard.  Wow, you're badass.  I bet there's 20 Indians within a mile of you that beat your ass on a daily basis. 
[02:10:00]  20 drunk Indians can beat you up.  Shut up.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You're a pussy.  I'm a pussy.  Yeah, you're a pussy stuck in a pussy fucking place.  I'm a pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.  You are.  You are.  What do you do for a living, faggot?  I do radio and comedy.  His phone is...  See, I'm confident in myself.  It don't matter what you say about me, because I know I fucking hear you. 
[02:10:30]  Apparently it does.  You want to be heard.  On our show.  Why don't you be heard on your show?  Oh, that's right.  What do you do?  What kind of menial labor job do you have, sir?  I'm sorry.  I didn't run and open and get lucky.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  Oh, is that it?  Whoa.  The guy knows my whole biography.  That's nice.  I don't know you from a fucking Renee in the wall.  Oh, shit.  Shit.  You fag.  That's a good point.  I'm a fag.  Hey, the jerk store called and they're all out of you. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  I nailed them.  I nailed them.  Hey.  Nailed them.  Alright, are we done?  Yeah.  Alright, thanks for that.  Jerk store.  I think the white guy is in the wrong there.  Oh, he is.  Absolutely.  He absolutely is.  He's lucky.  He's lucky all they do is fucking get some paper towels out in the end.  I'm just really interested in this black guy and the fact that he didn't do what  I think he would have done, which was, he wanted his stuff watched, but in that moment  you're so angry.  What you want to do is haul off.  Instantly, you think he would have just belted him before he said a word.  Anyone would carry on like that, but what's suspicious is the woman getting involved, 
[02:11:30]  like, she knows a lot.  Like, she knows, like, fuck, he just got out of jail, or he's on parole, or something,  because she's, like, really nervous.  Like, come on, let's make sure, you know, this doesn't get crazier, because I don't  want to lose him.  Yeah.  To whatever.  I would be interested in hearing.  Quick break, and then William Shatner.  Let's do this.  Oh, yeah.  Chop, chop.  Yeah.  Serious XM.  You're listening to O.B. Anthony.  All right.  William Shatner making his way down the hall.  I see him. 
[02:12:00]  God damn, does he look good for his age.  He looks good no matter what.  And he's walking in.  He's walking in as we speak.  Yes.  The great William Shatner.  There he is.  William Shatner.  I used to be.  The great William Shatner.  You're greater than ever, I believe.  How are you?  How are you?  I made a faux pas.  I said, William Shatner looks great for his age.  And then I went, no, he just looks great.  Oh, my God.  You look just great.  Well, I feel I'm on top of the world.  You are.  You're conquering all types of entertainment avenues. 
[02:12:30]  Yes.  You're all over the place.  I've conquered everything.  Yes.  TV, music, movies, of course, and now a live show.  Don't forget the porn.  Well, yes.  Of course.  Conquer radio.  You know, I don't know about conquering radio, but I started off on radio.  You did.  I did radio drama, radio things.  I did all kinds of radio.  Yeah.  With the Foley work, where you had to make the noises and stuff.  With the Foley.  Yeah.  I only know that word from Anthony.  I just know it as the noises you got to make.  The noises. 
[02:13:00]  Yes.  The movie noises.  Radio noises.  Yes, you're riding into the sunset.  And now.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Kimo sabe.  You did a few westerns in your day.  Yes.  And you're an equestrian.  You like horses.  Yes.  I am.  We do radio and horses and horse shows and raise money for kids.  You still ride?  Still.  I'm.  I.  My greatest achievement. 
[02:13:30]  My singular greatest achievement in my lifetime is I want a saddle in a horse competition.  I got the highest points and something or other.  And they gave me a really good saddle.  And I use that saddle.  And it has high point winner on whatever it is on the.  And it's no award that I've ever received.  Really?  The prestige and the value of the saddle.  Of winning that saddle.  And my wish for years was a belt buckle. 
[02:14:00]  If only I could win a belt buckle.  I would wear it instead of around my waist.  I'd wear it around like a tiara.  I mean, around your waist.  If you've got any kind of a pot, your pot spills over your belt buckle, right?  So it's disguised as a little sliver of silver beneath your belly.  Yeah.  But on your head.  That is true.  Especially if you've got lights on it.  Like twinkling lights.  What type of.  Is it your belt buckle?  It'd be beautiful. 
[02:14:30]  What type of competitions?  What?  What type of competitions?  Raining.  Raining.  Raining?  Yeah.  Do you know that you're nodding your head like the New York boy knows what I'm talking  about?  No.  I got it.  I was.  I was raised out in San Juan Capistrano and I did a lot of riding when I was a kid.  A lot of western.  Good.  I did Jim Canna, a pole bending barrel.  All right.  So then you're what I'm talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  Sliding stops and where the four turns around, changing leads fast and slow.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  All the cleaning.  I'm winning.  I'm winning.  At my age.  I'm against 18 year olds who were born in a saddle and I am knocking on the door every  time I'm on a horse.  Raining is all about control.  Control.  It's a dressage.  Yeah.  It is control.  When did you win the saddle?  A couple of years ago.  And I won a belt buckle this year.  Oh, you did get your belt buckle.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Why aren't you wearing it on your head?  Yeah.  It is.  It is.  People think it's part of me.  A belt buckle, that is because in riding a belt buckle is a very prestigious award. 
[02:15:30]  Exactly.  I mean, you see these cowboys with their big belt buckles.  I mean, you could buy a belt buckle that says, oh, you know, good or New York City or  something like that.  Yeah.  But it doesn't say champion.  When you win it.  When you win it.  Yeah.  It's like getting the Academy Award.  It is.  Yeah.  You're into so many things and, boy, you haven't slowed down.  It's great.  Now, what's this Broadway show about?  Listen, you know, you and we've all become buddies in the over the years and talking. 
[02:16:00]  And so the interview becomes something about myself.  Right.  And I tell you an incident and try and make you intrigue you into whatever it is I've  done that I'm trying to acquaint the public with.  Like the last time we were talking was about my record.  Yes.  Well, many of those stories are amplified, are really interesting.  They're aspects of my life. 
[02:16:30]  Like, for example, you were talking about the riding.  Well, I tell a story about a horse that I bought that was the most glorious horse that  ever was.  His name was Great Day.  And how I made him into a breeding horse.  And once he became a breeding horse, they started putting pawing chains on him.  And then they put kicking chains on them.  And they put poles on him to keep him from savaging himself because he would be get so  agitated.  And this gorgeous animal that I had fallen in love with, I finally incarcerated in a 
[02:17:00]  solitary confinement.  And then he died.  But he died in a particular way that I tell in the in the in the one man show is and it's  poignant.  And that's just a moment.  I bet.  Did he die in a funny way?  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  No, it wasn't funny.  I think so.  And you're always looking for the last.  I don't know.  With his legs up in the air or something?  This horse reared.  It's poignant.  Oh, it's poignant.  At the last.  Yeah, poignant means so sad. 
[02:17:30]  Different than funny.  Yes, I know.  Sorry.  There's somebody there's somebody in your staff right now like a P.O.I.N.G.  Maybe I'm not going P.O.I.G.  They're going P.O.Y.  Right.  Exactly.  Maybe I should have picked up on the poignant part.  You know, it's so ironic.  Listening would be really good.  You know, it's so ironic.  Bill, for so many years, I have watched Bill and his crew being in chains and captured  by some alien race, and you, through eloquent speech, kind of talk your way out of being 
[02:18:00]  locked up and enslaved and chained.  And then, ironically enough, your own horse suffers one of the fates that you did in many  Star Trek episodes.  Isn't that interesting?  Yes, yes.  I want to plug where it is, by the way.  February 14th through 24th, Music Box Theater.  Tickets are at Shatnersworld.com.  It's on Broadway.  It's opening in a one-man show on Broadway, February 16th.  And through the March 4th limited run.  Can we go?  And then I'm on tour.  Yeah, of course. 
[02:18:30]  You all can go.  Free?  And come.  And listen, the tickets aren't very expensive.  And this show is so successful that I think you should invite a large number of members  of your audience.  Yes.  I would love to go see it.  Yeah, absolutely.  No, seriously.  I think people have realized you are a fantastic storyteller.  I think when you were doing the talk show and seeing you in public and doing interviews  like this, you realize that William Shatner is a very good storyteller. 
[02:19:00]  No, no.  You used the word fantastic.  Why don't you stay with fantastic and say you're descending to good.  Spectacular.  Yes.  No, but really, it's mediocre.  I mean, when are we going with this?  It's downgrade.  It's reasonable.  It's reasonable.  You were very funny, by the way, on the Zach Wild Roast.  Your video was hilarious.  Oh, that's great.  It was a very, very in poor taste video.  It was very funny.  Well, Zach Wild is quite a character.  And you know, talking about characters on the Charlie Sheen Roast, which I was on briefly  to see Patrice. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  I don't know whether you know this, and forgive me as I tell it to you.  Patrice O'Neill was, in my opinion, sensational on the Charlie Sheen Roast because, first of  all, he lay across the dais in fatigue, and we didn't understand that.  And he just laid out in absolutely realistic terms, which were so funny, the idiocy of doing  a roast.  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  So that was funny.  And then he talked to me personally on the air, you know, what are you doing?  And I answered him back by saying, what you're doing right now, it's incredibly funny because  it's so real, because nobody else is going there.  Okay?  When we went to get our cars, he was there.  And my wife Elizabeth and I and he engaged in a very serious conversation about his diabetes  and about his sort of giving up. 
[02:20:30]  And she put her arms around him and urged him not to.  And sobbing, Patrice, sobbing, three of us, tears, we parted.  In that instant, we had become so close for a second.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then we left, and then...  That story, he told us that story.  He told that story.  He really...  It did affect him a lot.  Yeah, we were very close to him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That did affect him a lot.  He made fun of it a little bit, but you could tell...  He joked about it, but he really got to it.  He was touched by it.  Well, that's interesting.  He joked... 
[02:21:00]  He was touched by the story.  There you are.  The comic's instinct to joke about this incredible moment when we urged him to take care of himself.  Yeah.  And...  He said his body was going to quit on him or something.  That's right.  Or break down.  And it got...  It really...  It affected him.  And he really thought about it, and he heard it.  He heard.  He listened to his body.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he realized...  Some instinct in him realized that he was going to go.  If you could, would you shoot him in a photon torpedo case down onto the Genesis planet 
[02:21:30]  and then perhaps we could take him back.  We see the instinct is there.  Get away from the death.  Other people don't want to hear about that.  No, no.  He doesn't like it.  Well, you've always cheated death.  He gets uncomfortable.  That's what I'm saying.  Cheating death.  You've always cheated death.  And I was just wondering if you would send him down to the Genesis planet if you have  the power.  Oh, I see.  Yes, yes.  Oh, that's a shame.  I would resurrect him into a...  You know...  Out of all the comics I've known, he is the most human.  It's so bad.  But I tell you, a laugh line, and he would have them.  A laugh line is a work of art, isn't it? 
[02:22:00]  Yes.  I mean, a good joke is everything.  Yeah.  I mean, it's like a fine painting, a good joke.  We were...  And by the way, I strive to find them in the one-man show.  No, seriously.  Good luck finding them on this show.  Let's not forget about the one-man show.  The one-man show is a good joke.  I'm sure your show would be great.  And I would love to go backstage after and go, Phil, good job.  Yeah, come backstage.  Absolutely.  And you go, Jim, thank you.  I'm glad you came.  Oh, yeah.  And that Patrice story, I believe, was poignant.  It was poignant.  There you are. 
[02:22:30]  I just wanted William to know I know the word.  Yeah, poignant.  I wish I was using a word like that every day.  Yeah.  What I was getting at with the horse, because, you know, Animal House, the horse died silly.  So I thought you might have had one of those things happen.  No, no, no.  The horse died noble.  Noble.  You see?  Oh, okay.  I know what noble means.  Got a last...  Well, you are.  Thank you.  I'm noble.  The horse again for the last time.  For the last time.  That's exactly the way the story goes.  That is good.  Really?  Yeah.  That is good. 
[02:23:00]  How long is the show?  The show is 94, 97 minutes.  That's perfect.  Hour and a half.  It's perfect.  And no intermission.  How long have you been rehearsing it?  Well, I toured it in Australia.  I toured it in Canada in a somewhat different form.  But when I was asked to come to New York, I honed it down.  I leaned it down.  I'm being held to a different standard.  It's somewhat different, basically the same, but somewhat different.  And the audience reactions in both those other countries were superb, which is the reason  why I was invited down here.  So I've got my fingers crossed that the New York audience will accept me in the same way. 
[02:23:30]  Absolutely.  Do you use video, too, or pictures, or is it just...  I do.  There's some projection of events and things like that.  For example, riding bareback.  I had to do so in a movie, Alexander the Great.  Sorry.  Now, come on.  There's other definitions.  There are other definitions of bareback.  It might be a generational thing.  Actually, riding bareback.  No.  Riding bareback sort of spans the generation.  There's a commonality among us all about the bareback. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  But riding bareback on a horse presents a number of problems.  Yeah.  Some are obvious, and some are not.  Like getting up, how do you get on the horse?  It does take a good swing.  Grab onto the little piece of mane and just swing your legs up.  Yes.  But what if you have a cape and a sword and a skirt and a boot?  Right.  Yeah, that's a little rough.  That presents a problem.  And what do the Greeks, because this was Alexander the Great, what do the Greeks wear under their 
[02:24:30]  kilts?  Ah.  Ah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that gets a little...  It gets a little touchy.  Do they wear nothing under their kilts?  Well, who knows?  That was 2300.  What do Scots wear under their kilts?  Yeah.  I notice I've got all your attention now.  Your attention was wavering when I was talking about nobility and poignancy, but talk about  getting what Scots wear under their kilts has gotten your attention.  Well, riding a horse bareback and without any undergarments on, that would be a little  messy.  Especially, you know, if you're the proud possessor of a large sword. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, that is true.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to watch out.  If they did it in China for centuries, nobody noticed.  When it got to grease, it was a problem.  Because I could attest that...  You mean those horses were small.  Yeah.  I could attest that even with pants on and the proper undergarment, you still sometimes  if the horse takes a misstep, you can get hurt down there, yes.  Well, in your experience, as a question, men get hurt. 
[02:25:30]  I mean, a horse stops suddenly and you can't ride for several minutes, right?  That's...  Oh, yeah.  What do women get pleasure out of it?  Well, I have...  When I was riding, it was at a stable and there was a lot of other...  There were girls there and they would ride bareback a lot.  And...  And scream.  And scream.  It did look like we were enjoying ourselves.  Yes.  The guys would ride bareback and you'd be grimacing the whole time.  Because your tints get beat up.  And girls are just having fun.  No, trot, damn it! 
[02:26:00]  You know?  Hit the horse.  And then you've got to tell her, get on top of the horse!  Oh, Jimmy!  Do the girls lean forward just slightly?  They would get on certain...  To their pleasure?  Are you imagining...  Are you imagining with some poignancy what it used to be like?  Oh, yes.  Yes, I am, sir.  It's very hard for a guy.  You would literally have to squeeze your legs to keep yourself off of the back of the  horse a little bit.  Squeeze at your knees.  Well, that backbone...  Some horses' backbones are ridged. 
[02:26:30]  Yes.  Rather than having a coating of flesh so it's soft, there's a ridge there that gets  in your way a lot.  And if you get a slightly rotund horse, the back will be a little flat.  And you could actually sit on there with a little more comfort.  That's right.  And then slide off.  And slide off.  Yes, yes.  Well, there are the pluses of mine.  I'd rather slide off than have that ridge up your ass.  You ever break bones riding?  Oh, my gosh.  One of the stories I tell is my wrecking my leg. 
[02:27:00]  A horse falls on me.  Have you ever had that?  The horse rears up and it looks like it's going to crush you and die.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And at the last instant it fell over and landed on my leg.  Now I've got my leg and I go to get...  The horse rolls one way, I roll the other.  I go to get up.  I can't get up.  I rise, I fall.  I rise, I fall.  Phew.  And that moment, years later, informs me on how to play a critical scene in the movie  Star Trek.  Oh, man.  Is that an interesting story?  Which movie? 
[02:27:30]  Well, I'm not going to tell you because you've got to come see the show.  I've got to guess.  Can't you give us one?  The critical scene.  He won't give us one story.  No, he's just teasing.  Well, I'm teasing you the story.  How about trying to land a nose, a tail dragger airplane for the first time?  Oh, man.  I've been taught how to do aerobatics.  Okay.  I've done...  I'm checked out in aerobatics by a military instructor.  I've done a week.  They've sent me up solo for the first time.  Wow. 
[02:28:00]  In a pit special, which is an aerobatic airplane.  The sun is setting because the light is good.  And you have to land.  And the only way you land a tail dragger is by lining up on the runway.  And then, when you're over the runway, you look down to see if you're on the runway.  And then you land.  Wow.  Because, as you can imagine, you're in a flare position.  The nose is high.  You can't see in front of you like you can in a Cessna, which lands on a triangle.  Yeah, on a strike gear.  Oh, my God.  And I missed the runway. 
[02:28:30]  So, you're off the runway.  I'm off the runway.  But he's not going to tell us what happened.  No, because the sun sets.  We know you lived.  We know you lived.  Well, now, the answer to all these questions are at the Music Box Theater.  He's always the best.  Starting February 16th.  January 14th.  We had the 14th.  February, well, that's the previews, 14th and 15th are the previews.  I open February 16th, and I run until March 4th.  And then I begin, a week after that, a 15-city tour. 
[02:29:00]  Are we invited to the 14th through the 16th?  You are invited.  The 14th through the 16th?  Invited, invited.  Can I ask you this?  Please.  When the horse fell on you, what injuries did you get in real life?  They mashed my leg.  And I was taken to a hospital, and there was an adventure there, too.  Did you tell at the Music Box?  Well, yes.  I'll give you the line that Patrice would have loved.  Okay.  I'm asked to pee in the bottle. 
[02:29:30]  And I'm sitting.  I can't move.  So I'm sitting on the edge of the bed, peeing into the bottle with the curtains closed,  and the curtains open up.  And a nurse looks at me.  She looks at me.  She says, oh, my God.  I'm your biggest fan.  I'm your biggest fan.  Does that sound like a fun show?  Yeah.  Does that sound like a show you want to go see?  It would have been a better story if it was George Takei.  No, that's a different story.  I would absolutely not.  That has a poignancy to it that I don't know. 
[02:30:00]  You talk about your career, too, obviously.  Yeah, I go through my life and tell you incidences.  You know, the questions of who you are, what you are, why am I here?  They're all rhetorical questions because there's no answer.  I mean, why are you here?  I don't know.  Yeah.  But if you were to say, well, this is what I've done.  This is what I hear.  What I used to do is what I'd like to do.  You figure it out.  Why am I here?  And essentially, that's what I'm doing.  I'm giving you aspects of my life that I think are interesting, a couple of which I've just mentioned. 
[02:30:30]  And then perhaps you can help me come to a conclusion.  Who am I?  What am I?  Do you take time off?  You're very interesting to me because you work, like every time we see you, it's a new project.  It was the book and the CD last time.  Always different.  Now it's this time.  It's this TV project.  It's like every time you're doing something, it's like what an amazing life to always be doing something.  And that's what I, I mean, to me, it's like ordinary.  I, a few weeks ago, a couple months ago, on a Thursday, I was filming, directing a documentary on the last Xena convention. 
[02:31:00]  Okay.  And the people who go.  I flew on Friday to New Orleans and did a speaking engagement on Saturday in New Orleans.  Flew back Saturday night to Los Angeles and continued filming the Xena convention on a Sunday. 
[02:31:30]  Now, that to me is like, that's my life.  You enjoy that though, don't you?  Well, yes and no.  I mean, I don't want to go from home.  I want to be on a horse.  I want to be with my wife.  I want to be with my grandchildren.  But that's my life.  And here I am doing reams of publicity.  You know, it's four o'clock in the morning for me.  Is it getting up at seven o'clock in the morning?  It's four o'clock in the morning for me.  I'm up at four o'clock my time in order to tell you guys I'm doing this one man show.  Yeah.  Which is, you know, scary.  It's scary going on stage at the Music Box Theater alone. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  But all I've got is the proof that it worked before it should work again.  And you're a legend who doesn't.  That's the amazing part is you for many years could have relaxed and done nothing.  And every time, it's not just a new bullshit project.  It's like a really involved work.  Like a one man show is a real thing.  That's 90 minutes of performing alone.  Right.  And you've transcended the Star Trek thing.  You've gone beyond that to become, you know, you're William Shatner.  It's not like, hey, it's Captain Kirk. 
[02:32:30]  You know, you've worked on so many other projects now that that's part of your life, but it doesn't define you anymore.  And that's exactly one of the themes of the one man show.  Oh, OK.  I speak for about 15 minutes about Star Trek, but not, you know, Captain Kirk.  And I talk about aspects that you guys would know about, like how my relationship with the National Aeronautics Space Administration, NASA, my relationship with them and what happened. 
[02:33:00]  Like the last wake up call on the last shuttle on the last morning was I woke them up.  All right.  Yeah.  Wow.  So it's a while.  And that's what I hope you'll say time and again in this one man show.  Wow.  Well, how many of all the years you've been famous, who is somebody that was a fan of yours that you were surprised about?  Like, I'm a big guy.  I grew up watching you.  I love you.  And you're like, oh, Jesus, I really have made it.  You, you, you, you've just surprised me. 
[02:33:30]  Jimmy Norton.  No, but I'm not a fan.  That surprises me too.  I guess what Jimmy's saying, you've met everyone, but has there been one guy where you went, oh, wow, now I'm impressed.  If I said President Obama, would, would you, would you believe me?  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  He said, like, I'm a big nerd for Star.  He said he's a big fan.  Like, that's gotta be kind of.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Have you met Obama?  Oh.  So you don't believe me?  I don't believe you. 
[02:34:00]  All kinds of people.  From every walk of life.  It just absolutely surprised me.  I'll tell you one.  Yeah.  I had to do, I was going essentially around the world in order to film.  You were in Orbit.  I was in Orbit.  No, no.  Don't say Orbit.  Say Priceline.com.  Oh, my God.  Damn.  Damn.  Priceline.com.  Wow.  Oh, I got that in, didn't I?  Yes, you did.  You certainly did.  And in the roast video, too.  I couldn't be there because Priceline doesn't book direct flights. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, you were very funny.  There was a time that the company was going to crash and burn, and then all of a sudden  it came back.  It did.  It crashed and burned.  It did officially crash and burn, right?  It was the dot-com bubble.  Yeah.  And I had all this stock.  And I couldn't sell it because you're tied up when you're an original member.  Yeah.  And so it crashes and burns.  The stock's worth pennies.  So I sell it.  It's worth pennies.  Oh, man.  And then it came back.  It came back to whatever it is now.  Can me and Ann talk to you about it again?  That's the first time we met Shatner, and you don't even remember because we were just 
[02:35:00]  nobodies.  I remember every moment on the OP.  And then he actually imitated you before and had to introduce you on stage.  Oh, it was the-  At the big price line, we're all millionaires party that we had to go to.  Oh, really?  I don't know about that.  But we didn't have the stock like everyone else in the room.  It was a big warehouse, what?  Was I there?  Yeah.  Yeah, you were.  Yeah.  And these guys went from, like, no money to we're all millionaires.  But I had sold my stock for-  Before that?  For about $5,000.  Yeah, I made about $5,000.  Right. 
[02:35:30]  And all these guys were, I don't know whether they held them because so many people bailed out.  Yeah.  This was early on when they went from we had this stock to we're all rich.  The stock came out at, I don't know, $5, $7, something like that.  And it went to $150 during the dot-com bubble.  And everybody was saying, we're rich, we're rich.  As soon as we can sell, we're going to sell.  Yeah.  Because you're locked up.  Then it crashed while you were locked up.  Well, that makes me feel much better about what we saw that day.  Well, I hope so.  I now see this poignant smile on your face. 
[02:36:00]  I feel better now because we're walking around like, well, we're not rich like these people.  No.  These guys went from what we were to millionaires.  And now they're back to what you are.  But you're trying to tell me they never officially were millionaires.  No.  Fuck, that's great.  Paper millionaires.  Can you say that word on the air?  Yes.  Sorry.  We encourage you.  Sorry, you want to say one?  Yeah, didn't the FDA, I was going to say.  FDA.  Not satellite.  No, we're free.  Didn't that just cost you $500,000?  No.  It would have on regular terrestrial type radio, yeah.  Well, what are we on?  Satellite.  Satellite. 
[02:36:30]  Get away!  There's nobody listening to us.  Exactly.  You finally realized after all these years.  Wait a minute, what?  After all these years, there's seven people in Poughkeepsie.  What?  Satellite?  Why am I wasting my time?  All these years you thought we were just saying shit and getting in trouble for us?  That happens.  So wait, what story?  You were just telling a story.  Yes.  About the person using the surprising one.  Who was a fan?  So I've got to go around the world in order to film this documentary.  I directed called The Captains. 
[02:37:00]  I was here on it.  Oh, right.  In which we played on the aircraft carrier, the Intrepid here.  Yeah.  The sun is setting.  And the lights of New York on one side, the sun's setting up.  And we're playing The Captains.  One of the great moments of my life.  And I had to go around the world in an airplane.  I had to, like, go commercial.  I couldn't go commercial.  It was too fast, too much.  I just couldn't do it physically.  And I called the head of Bombardier, America's great airplane manufacturer. 
[02:37:30]  Yes.  And called.  I said, listen, can you help me?  And the head of the company, Steve Rodolfi, says, I'll help you.  And he lends me an airplane.  He lends you an airplane.  And I land in Toronto to pick up equipment and stuff.  And he meets me at the airplane.  He says, I would not have become an aeronautical engineer and thusly move up the company to  become CEO of something or other there if it hadn't been for you. 
[02:38:00]  Wow.  Oh, man.  Is that a wild thing?  That's a good trade-off.  It was a great trade-off.  Yeah.  Of course, the Bombardier airplane is featured in the documentary, but what an extraordinary  moment.  But to be able to call the head of an airline, that to me is the greatest part.  Sure.  Like, I just called the head of the airline.  It's fun to be you.  Well, no, but I had a Volkswagen, sort of an expensive Volkswagen, and the transmission  fell out.  Yeah.  And here's the payoff for them. 
[02:38:30]  So I called the guy that I bought.  He says, well, you know, I can't help you there.  I said, well, this is ridiculous.  This is an expensive car.  And the transmission's just stopped.  I'm going to call the head of the company.  I call the head of North American Volkswagen.  Hey, what's going on here?  I bought an expensive car.  He said, you're right.  And they replaced the transmission free of charge.  So you got on the phone.  Did he know you were calling or did he just go, hi, this is William Scherer?  Well, I said no.  It was a cold call.  And here is what I think. 
[02:39:00]  And this is for your audience.  I think that anybody who's doing something that they're selling to the public is very  conscious of the fact that they want their product to be well received by the public.  And part of their job is to take a public complaint and to do something about it.  So if you've got a real complaint, a legitimate complaint about something you've bought that  should work and doesn't work, you have a reason to call.  First of all, the people who sold it to you. 
[02:39:30]  And then move up the line.  It's only a phone call.  I'm calling to friggin' complain.  I don't know for sure we're on satellite today.  We might have went back to regular radio there.  Exactly.  About this product.  Although it's a different effect.  If, like, say, Sam, who you say, who is Sam?  He's that zilch in the corner.  Now, if he calls, it's a little different than when you pick up the phone and there's  an icon on the other end.  You can recognize his voice.  No, but then you could say, this is Sam, the zilch in the corner, that is complaining  about your product. 
[02:40:00]  And you will get attention.  Yeah, you're right.  And also, I've written letters to Continental Airlines when I've had issues, and they have  gotten back to me and fixed it, because if you take the time to do that, they think  it's worth helping you.  They, major companies, most major companies, have a department of one or 50 people whose  job it is to take care of the public complaints.  Dear Continental Airlines, there's a man on the wing, and I was very disappointed with  my trip.  It was very frightening.  That's right.  And for some reason, Bill, that wife that you had in that show, right, she, you just 
[02:40:30]  had a nervous breakdown in the show, The Twilight Zone, a nightmare at 20,000 feet.  And why didn't she sit by the window and just, you tell her, look, you want to help me?  Look out the window the entire flight.  Just stay awake and look.  I'm going to sit here and not have to deal with that thing on the wing.  Because that's why you're doing radio.  Yeah.  And you're not in dramaturgy and television.  Really? 
[02:41:00]  Is that it?  I thought it was good that I was thinking more.  Because suspension of disbelief.  Oh.  That's what it is.  Suspension of disbelief, which you don't have to do, by the way, on February 16th.  It's all real.  It's all real.  And it's all you.  Tell me, and I'm telling you things that you, that the logic of which, which is what  your mind is going to, I fit.  You will be so logically at home.  No confusion.  Are you on Twitter?  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Oh, yeah.  I saw a statistic that I'm very popular on Twitter. 
[02:41:30]  Of course you are.  Yeah.  I had no idea.  Are you William Shatner on Twitter?  Yeah.  Okay.  You got the name.  Yeah.  Well, who else would I be?  There might be some William Shatner in the corner.  There might be a William Shatner in Canada that doesn't want to give your name away.  A professor from a community college.  What kind of guy was Rod Serling?  Because I've met very, very few people that ever met Rod Serling.  Yeah.  Yeah, kind of a mysterious guy.  He is.  He was a very...  Did you get to know him at all?  I worked with him in live television.  By the way, I tell some live television stories. 
[02:42:00]  I'm a relic from those days.  And he was very hard to know.  I, of course, was a young actor and was in awe of all the stuff I was doing.  So I wouldn't have approached him like I would now.  Right.  Say, what kind of a guy are you?  But he was removed.  I'm sure he was very warm.  And his wife, the last thing I knew, was still alive and speaking very fondly of him. 
[02:42:30]  Now?  Recently.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  So he was...  But he was a terrifically creative guy.  Mm-hmm.  And the people that he surrounded himself with, the writers that he surrounded himself...  I got to know...  I did a movie with one of them and they all came and helped this writer.  And the movie I did, which this writer wrote, these guys, this group of people that he surrounded himself with, call themselves the Green Thumb. 
[02:43:00]  And among them were Richard Matheson, who's become so famous as a writer, I think director as well, producer.  Um, just as an incidental story, the writer of the movie, which was called, uh, I'll think of it in a second.  He died of, uh, the disease where you age, uh, so quickly. 
[02:43:30]  Progeria?  Progeria.  Progeria?  That's for kids though.  He's 30 years old.  He's finished the movie.  It's his greatest triumph.  We did it from a book that, uh, that he had written.  So he...  And we go down south and make the movie.  And all his friends are with him.  It's the most glorious moment in his life as a writer.  A movie is produced of a book that he wrote.  And all his friends are around him.  And we all love him.  And we make the movie.  And it's, like, great.  And then in about a year, he becomes 95. 
[02:44:00]  Geez.  Yeah.  Is that science fiction or what?  Wow.  And he died, right?  You know what?  A shot of adrenaline probably would have fixed him.  Like, Bones gave you guys when you got old, uh, in that episode because you went down  to the planet.  And, uh, remember that one?  I love you.  And you were old.  I love you.  And then Bones went, Adrenaline!  I gave him Adrenaline!  Because he was all old.  And it worked.  Oh, my God.  I wish I had thought of that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I've seen Star Trek and I've watched it, but I know very little of it. 
[02:44:30]  Me too.  Me too.  I've forgotten more than you remember.  Oh.  You smoke it for gas.  You smoke pot, William?  Did you ever smoke pot?  Oh, all the time.  Really?  No.  Used to.  It's a great drug.  What are you talking about?  I'm thinking about doing it again.  You mean like now?  Groovy in the day.  Yeah, why not?  It's been about, I don't know, 20 years for me.  Well, why do you bring that subject up?  I don't know.  You just kind of...  Just introduce the subject.  You kind of laugh at things.  Thanks. 
[02:45:00]  Oh.  Well, you can laugh at...  Like a pothead would.  In a good way.  You seem a little high right here.  No.  I'm drinking tea here.  Okay.  No, that's me.  I take decaffeinated beverages all the time.  Yeah.  My coffee is decaffeinated.  I don't need caffeine.  And I've been actually, other people have said that, you see, but I don't take drugs anymore.  Yeah, I've been clean for a really long time.  Yeah.  Occasional grass cigarette in the day.  It was terrific. 
[02:45:30]  Now, the younger William Shatner that you were talking about, like doing the Twilight  Zones and stuff like that, and now, what would you say is the biggest difference that,  let's not say age, we'll say experience, has given you between those years?  Well, on the show, on the one-month show at the Music Box Theater, I talk about going  on stage as an understudy without any rehearsal in the longest speaking role in the English 
[02:46:00]  language.  Oh, man.  Okay?  I'd only rehearsed it because I was in a little room at the theater.  I lived in a small one-room thing while I was at this classical theater in Stratford,  and I was understudy Henry V, and I was drilling it for some reason.  I don't know why I was drilling the words into my head.  But there had been no rehearsals because we were playing at night and rehearsing something 
[02:46:30]  else during the day.  Understudy rehearsals were going to be held weeks from now.  But for some reason, I was drilling these words, and every time I came to a loud speech  where historically, the historical drama, there was this declamation, and once more  I'd go into the toilet and flush, I'd sit in the john and flush the toilet so that nobody  would hear me.  Right.  And then went on. 
[02:47:00]  I was asked to go on in a role, in the largest speaking role in the English language.  I went on without any rehearsal, without ever having done it out loud before.  And how did it go?  It went extremely well.  I'm telling you that because I was a callow youth and arrogant, I guess, to say yes.  I mean, how could you possibly say yes to something like that?  Because I was asked, will I go on?  Uh-huh.  If you were to ask me now, my response would be, are you crazy? 
[02:47:30]  Well, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  How can you ask somebody to go on who don't even know the names of the actors that you're  acting with?  How long is the part if it's the biggest English speaking part?  You mean in terms of time?  Yeah.  Or what makes it the longest?  Well, it's all these set speeches that Henry V, it's a historical drama written by Shakespeare  that celebrated the English victories over the French.  And so he just starts yelling and screaming about how good it is, you know, every other 
[02:48:00]  page.  Can you do the Shakespeare accent now at all?  Or do you do that?  Shakespeare accent?  Yeah.  That English accent?  Well, no.  No, no, no.
