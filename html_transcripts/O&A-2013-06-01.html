<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion about the Milton twins in the pornography industry, noting their "dead-eyed" appearance and one twin's pregnancy while performing.  This segued into a discussion of Courtney Love's reported marriage to a trans person in Vegas, Maria Menounos's breast-grabbing incident with a bicyclist, and author Ben Mesrick.  Numerous advertisements for products like Instaflex, Warrior Mist, Dropcam, and Maui Jim sunglasses punctuated the show. Opie then recounted a humorous trip to the Pocono Mountains with his brothers, detailing their golf game, particularly their encounter with a par six hole and their renaming of Camelback Mountain to "Camel Toe Mountain."

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a review of the HBO film *Behind the Candelabra*, focusing on graphic descriptions of its sex scenes and the performances of Michael Douglas and Matt Damon.  This was followed by an interview with Ben Mesrick, author of *Straight Flush*, discussing the exploits of his college friends who built a massive online poker empire and are now fugitives.  The interview covered their illegal activities, legal battles, and the complexities of online gambling regulations.  Throughout this section, there were brief mentions of other SiriusXM programming.

The show then shifted to a discussion of suspected cheating in online poker and anecdotes about players recovering losses due to manipulated game outcomes.  This transitioned into a segment on "Prancercise," featuring highly offensive descriptions of Joanne O'Rourke's appearance and exercise routine.  O'Rourke herself called in, participating in an interview filled with crude and sexually suggestive language from the hosts and a Yellowstone caller.

Next, comedian Bill Burr joined the show.  The conversation focused on Burr's frustration with paying debts and taxes, likened to a "death note,"  and veered into a debate about the moon landing conspiracy theory, referencing Joe Rogan and Neil deGrasse Tyson's views.  The hosts displayed online images purportedly showing evidence of the moon landing.  Numerous advertisements for products, including joint supplements, Wi-Fi cameras, pain relief products, brain training programs, men's grooming products, a dating website, and a Fidelity Investments career opportunity, were interspersed throughout this portion.  The segment concluded with an explicit call from Bob Levy, who, along with Jim Florentine, shared graphic anecdotes about picking up women while on tour.

A significant portion of the show featured raunchy anecdotes from Opie, Anthony, and guest Bob Levy about their experiences on the road.  These included accounts of soliciting prostitutes, group sex, encounters with strippers, and other sexually explicit details.  Levy shared a story about disrupting a colleague's romantic encounter with a prostitute, another about a colleague's awkward attempt to avoid payment for a prostitute, and yet another about a colleague boasting about his sexual prowess and multiple marriages.  Levy also recounted a bizarre encounter with a woman he mistook for a vending machine.  The hosts also discussed their commercial work, including a humorous anecdote about an adult diaper commercial, and made jokes about the studio smelling like farts.  Later, they touched upon Maria Menounos's previous appearance on the show and Levy’s experiences in college and early career, including a listener's call expressing hatred for his radio show.  Numerous commercial breaks punctuated this segment.

The show included a studio interview with Courtney Love, who was named "Worst of the Week." Opie began by discussing his Twitter interactions and disdain for his critics. The conversation turned to inappropriate touching, spurred by a news story about Beyoncé, prompting anecdotes of unwanted touching from the hosts and a female guest.  Love discussed her past wild behavior, a false SNL story, a tampon-throwing rumor, her current life, an upcoming television appearance (initially kept secret), her legal battles over stolen Nirvana memorabilia, her relationship with her daughter, and her experiences with Howard Stern.  She used profanity liberally throughout the interview.  The interview concluded with Love confirming her involvement in a major television show's judging role.

Finally, the show featured an interview with comedian Colin Quinn, discussing his one-man show, "Unconstitutional."  He contrasted performing in a theater (Barrow Street Theater) with comedy clubs, detailing an encounter with an intimidating audience member during a Broadway performance.  He discussed the financial aspects of Broadway versus touring, the writing process for "Unconstitutional," his choice of the Constitution as a subject, the Founding Fathers, slavery, and the compromises in the Constitution's drafting.  He also discussed future show plans, including potential topics like pressure point techniques, inventions, corporate espionage, and the loss of manufacturing jobs in America.  He covered his research and writing methods and the impact of confidence and momentum in his work.  The interview ended with a promotion of his show and a mention of a recent murder near a Barnes & Noble in Greenwich Village.  The show concluded with a segment on stand-up comedy, emphasizing the importance of commitment and conviction in a performance, regardless of material quality.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We banged plenty of them.  That just seems like taking advantage of special needs people.  Well, there's movies about that.  I don't know whether it's taking advantage or just giving them a full life.  Here's Dale.  You're on the Runa Fez Show.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What do you guys think about the twins?  Like, there's the Milton twins.  There's been a couple of others, identical twins in the pornography industry.  The Milton twins always look dead-eyed to me. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, they don't look like they're having much fun.  No, they almost look like captives.  And I think I saw one of them pregnant.  Yeah, one of them was pregnant and, you know, doing it with the twin.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  They never touch each other.  They just do it next to each other.  Double-teaming a dude with the twin while pregnant.  Yeah.  But they are, like the other people, they don't touch.  But they are right there, you know. 
[00:01:00]  They were big.  They were big because they were, like, around when, like, broadband internet really blew up.  That's when they, that's what their time was, those few years.  And everyone was like, oh, man, the Milton twins, sexy.  And here she was just pregnant having sex.  This has been Ron and Fez, the Flashback Show.

[00:10:00]  This is the Worst of the Week Countdown.  When we take the best of this week's Opie and Anthony Show, call it the worst, wait it, and then count it down for your listening pleasure.  Here's your host, what?  Sydney.  Pace.  Welcome again.  It's the Worst of the Week Countdown here on the Opie and Anthony Channel.  My name is Sam Roberts from the Opie and Anthony Show.  And after Opie and Anthony Live, and you know what we do, on the countdown, we count down all the wonderful moments that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:10:30]  A lot to get to this week, as a matter of fact.  Maria Menounos from Extra was in studio.  So was Courtney Love.  Great interview with Courtney Love coming up.  Bill Burr stopped by.  Jim Florentine.  Before we get to any of that, it was a short week this week.  We had a long weekend.  Opie spent a long weekend with his brothers up in the Poconos.  There were no champagne glasses.  There was no Mount Airy Lodge, but there was hijinks and outdoor activity. 
[00:11:00]  This is how we start the countdown.  Opie's weekend in the Poconos.  Number eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Number eight.  I went up to the old Poconos.  Yeah.  The Pocono region.  Yeah, huh?  Got a lot of...  Champagne glass?  Did you do the champagne glass with the bubbles?  Well, you just beat me to what I was saying.  Oh, damn it.  Because I said I got a lot of tweets from people saying, 
[00:11:30]  Hey, you in the champagne glass with your brothers?  I wasn't near Mount Airy Lodge.  Or maybe I was.  I don't know.  I went up to a place called Shawnee Inn.  My lovely wife set up a nice little weekend for me and my two brothers.  A little getaway from it all?  It was awesome, man.  Shawnee Inn was a place we used to go as kids.  My dad got one of those timeshares up there.  When Penn Jillette was talking about the timeshares the other day and how they're a huge scam, 
[00:12:00]  I felt a little awkward because my dad got one of those timeshares.  I think back in the day it wasn't as bad.  And then at the end, all we had to pay for was the maintenance fees to stay up there for a week.  That's pretty nice.  It was pretty nice.  It was real nice.  It was nice going back there.  Was it...  What kind of recreational activities?  I played a little golf.  A little golf.  A little golf. 
[00:12:30]  That was the course.  Nice.  Yeah.  They have three nine-hole courses that they mix and match.  Oh.  But this is probably two inside.  They have three par fives per side.  Three par fives.  So three par fives in the front nine.  Three par fives in the back nine.  There's six par fives.  That's a lot.  I like my traditional golf where it's maybe four par fives for a round.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I also like a par five because I'm like, ooh, maybe I'll be able to do this one.  Oh, really? 
[00:13:00]  You like par fives?  I hate par fives.  Well, sure.  Are those easy?  No.  They're long.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  They're just long.  They're like 500 plus yards.  Maybe I'll be able to par this one.  And then they had par threes where you've taken out your driver.  I hate those.  This is too inside.  This is golf shit.  But besides that, it was great.  But more importantly, we were talking over the weekend how every once in a while you  come across a course that decides to be different and they got a par six. 
[00:13:30]  What?  Oh, the par six.  You've never played a par six?  I've never played a par six.  It's their gimmick.  And they have a name for the whole, like, the monster.  And it's a par six.  Everyone talks about it at the bar.  How'd you do on the monster?  But it's stupid.  It's illegal, I think.  Illegal?  Yes.  As far as, like, the PGA and the official rules of golf.  There's one in Idaho.  I'm just looking right now.  There you go.  It's 777 yards.  That's so stupid.  That's just stupid. 
[00:14:00]  There's nothing fun about that.  Got to let it all hang out.  Right.  Grip it and rip it.  Grip it and rip it.  That's right.  They have a great picture of Jackie Gleeson.  And I guess Jackie Gleeson, back in the day, back in 19, I want to say 1953, was up there  playing golf with Arnold Palmer.  Ah, the great one.  And they're holding on to that moment ever since.  I bet you Jackie Gleeson was there for one afternoon.  Once.  Maybe he was playing a gig in the area.  Maybe playing a gig at the Shawnee Inn Complex.  Because, you know, back in the day. 
[00:14:30]  Back in the day.  Those places were huge up there.  Hell yeah.  And they got a picture of him on the first tee with Arnold Palmer.  It's a great picture.  But that picture is duplicated all over the fucking place.  You can't walk around without seeing the Jackie Gleeson picture.  Look, he was here.  He was here, see?  Any, like, newer celebrity pictures?  Not really.  That's it.  Not really.  Fucking 1953.  They have one of Bob Hope.  Bob Hope was up there performing.  Hey, yeah, I gotta tell you.  I was performing up here.  And I think Eisenhower was up there for something. 
[00:15:00]  No one really of, uh...  I mean, the Catskills and the Poconos used to have those monster fucking resorts.  And all the big stars went up there.  That was where everybody went.  And the rich and famous used to go up there.  We watched Dirty Dancing.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like the same fucking shit.  My brother was telling me yesterday, I guess most of them, especially in the Catskills,  have shut down the big resorts.  Yeah, yeah.  The big hotels and stuff.  And they're just sitting there, just rotting away.  I guess there used to be something like 12 major ones, and now they're down to one or two. 
[00:15:30]  And the rest of them, they just left, and they're just rotting away.  Wow, they just boogied out of there, huh?  And those urban explorers, you know, they get in, and supposedly the pictures are amazing.  That'd be kind of cool to see.  They're online somewhere.  I didn't search it out yet, but I got it.  Grossingers?  Was that one of the places?  Grossingers.  I think, right?  I'll say one of them, too, is the casinos.  Those fucking casinos in Connecticut going up.  It's like they're just casino business.  Yeah, there's no reason to go to the poker.  If you can just go up here and gamble in Connecticut, why would you go there?  And the Hamptons. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, the Hamptons.  The Hamptons started developing and becoming a thing.  There's grossingers.  Are they still open?  Wow.  Oh, we'll have to look open.  Look at that.  Wow, that's cool, though.  The pool is empty, and there's, like, green shit growing at the bottom.  Weeds and stuff.  It's like that sort of useful.  Oh, man.  Wow.  What year did it close?  What year did it grow soon?  I never heard of it.  Oh, God.  I remember hearing of that place.  There were some people that used to go there.  These things must have closed.  1986.  86.  When was it popular?  Okay.  Probably in the fucking, like. 
[00:16:30]  In the 50s?  No, I bet even the 60s and 70s, it was probably.  Yeah, they probably made it to the 70s easily.  It probably started dying out, right?  The ass end of the 70s.  Disco killed it.  Yeah.  Basically.  Did disco kill it?  No, I'm just saying.  Disco.  Anytime something dies in the 70s, I say disco killed it.  Late 70s, early 80s.  Oh, wait.  Resorts like Grossinger's or the Concord could no longer attract younger guests.  That's what it was.  I don't know about the Concord.  But the older people start dying off.  It's like, once you're. 
[00:17:00]  Well, Swayze wants to dirty dance and they are offended by it.  No one puts baby in a corner.  Of course not.  Right.  But man, those fucking mountains are relaxing.  I keep thinking I want a beach house.  I think I might want a lake house.  Really?  There's so much more to do.  The lake house.  You could kayak.  You could.  Keep going back in time.  Whoa.  You could kayak.  You could shoot shit.  You could play golf.  Yeah.  All at the same time.  Do some hiking.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, that doesn't look very good.  I would love to stay here.  Where is this?  Abandoned NYC. 
[00:17:30]  Where is this?  This is the Paul G. Hotel.  The Paul G. Hotel.  Needs a good vacuuming.  Yeah.  Needs a paint job.  You've got a moisture problem there.  You've got to look into.  I think so.  I love that shit.  Urban exploring, man.  It really is cool.  It's like modern artifacts, you know?  Right.  Wow.  What the fuck?  Well, that's some old room and now there's just plants growing in it?  Yeah.  Well, it's been down since, what, 86? 
[00:18:00]  It looks like the pool room.  It's almost 30 years.  The pool room, yeah, because it's indoors and there's all sorts of plants growing where  plants shouldn't be growing.  That's pretty fucking wild.  I love that shit.  Oh, just relax.  Where's that?  That looks nice.  It's the salon.  The salon.  Oh, there's an old sand dryer there.  Shit.  Just think of what went on in there.  All the kibitzing.  A lot of kibitzing, I bet.  That's the entrance.  That's cool.  You've got to check that out.  The highlight, I don't have many stories for my weekend, but the one thing, we went to 
[00:18:30]  Camelback Mountain, which is great.  Camel Toe Mountain.  Camel Toe.  Great.  You see the picture?  We made Camel Toe Mountain.  I saw you.  We're fucking idiots.  Because I guess at the top of the mountain, they call it Camel Top.  Oh.  So we noticed you just fucking put an E where that P is, and boy, the fun ensued.  And the laughs start rolling.  See?  Now it's welcome to Camel Toe, huh?  Camel Toe.  Get that picture.  We're hilarious. 
[00:19:00]  And I was wondering what these ski resorts were doing to stay in business, because we  haven't had, you know, winter in a long fucking time around here.  Yeah.  So the skiing has been in trouble for many, many years now.  Man, Camelback Mountain turned it into a fucking water park down below.  Really?  It looks like it's a permanent water park, too.  They cover that shit up during ski season, and then you can skate.  People do love their water parks.  And they had the zip line, which we did. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, that's fucking racist.  Come on now.  Anyone could use it.  You go to the top of Camelback, and it's a 4,000 foot zip line all the way to the bottom.  4,000 feet.  4,000 feet.  And you're going over, we figured it all out.  You're going over 30 miles an hour for over a minute.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  I really liked it.  I didn't find it scary, but I found it pretty damn cool to be just sitting in a seat with  nothing around you and just flying down the zip line. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, it is pretty cool.  It was awesome, man.  Nice getaway.  Yeah, it was a good getaway.  No real stories, just relaxing, sleeping with a window open and not hearing traffic.  That was pretty fucking cool.  I have become a fucking city boy.  A country.  God, I forgot that you could actually open a window and sleep with that fresh air without  hearing anything.  It is amazing what you can get used to in New York.  I haven't gotten used to it. 
[00:20:30]  There are people that would just bolt up awake from hearing that fucking fire engine.  And the knock, knock, knock, and you're just like, oh.  The worst of the week countdown.  Countdown.  Worst of the week countdown on the Opie and Anthony channel, counting down the great moments  that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony show.  My name is Sam Roberts.  I'm on the Opie and Anthony show.  And after Opie and Anthony live, a lot happened this week.  Ben Mesrick was in studio.  The author.  So was Courtney Love. 
[00:21:00]  Maria Menounos.  Bill Burr stopped by.  Jim Florentine.  Oh, my God.  So much to get to.  The Liberace movie premiered last weekend.  Jim and Ant both got a chance to watch this Liberace movie.  It really was a great movie.  And Liberace made quite the talking point this week on the Opie and Anthony show.  Love, so to Kenny.  Speaking of movies, the show got off on a bad start. 
[00:21:30]  Why?  You should, you're not talking about the Liberace movie.  Oh, well, I did see that.  So did I.  That's all you should be talking about.  We all got screeners.  I did not see the movie.  I watched it.  Our pal Tom Papa's in the movie.  He's very good.  He's very good.  He didn't get fucked in the ass.  Whoa.  Well, talk about the movie, Kenny.  What do you like about the movie?  Yeah, tell us a little about it.  Yeah.  The ass fucking.  There's a lot of ass fucking.  There was some ass fucking going on. 
[00:22:00]  There was some cock sucking.  There was fucking pounding.  All hot and sweaty and glistening.  They're using poppers.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Tom?  They were using poppers.  I saw that.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of kissing going on.  Oh, yeah.  Deep tongue kissing.  Open mouth.  And then the first night Matt Damon stayed over, he didn't want to do anything because 
[00:22:30]  he wanted to give it like one night.  Yeah, he was a little apprehensive.  That didn't last too long.  No.  Because when he woke up, he saw Michael Douglas just smiling at him.  Oh, he was hovering over him.  Yeah.  Creepy smile.  Then Michael Douglas sees like Matt Damon's tent and he goes, ooh, look who's awake.  Let me suck it to sleep.  That's not what he said.  And he sucked his dick with a morning breath.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all I can think of is he's sucking his dick with a morning breath.  With Liberace morning breath. 
[00:23:00]  Lee.  Lee, yes.  Yeah.  Lee.  How cute was Lee without his toupee?  That was fucking funny, man.  At the end, he looked like E.T. laying in the fucking bathroom.  All gray.  That was a toupee, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Liberace had the big toupee.  Oh, you're seeing me without my hair.  He has to win something for that, Michael Douglas.  He was fucking amazing.  He was great.  Yeah.  He was great.  He won fucking anal warts.  Rob Lowe was fucking great. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, that was Rob Lowe.  It was so funny.  There's the face he's making.  Oh, my God.  I didn't recognize him.  He plays the plastic surgery guy.  The plastic surgeon.  Doctor.  He was great watching him drink.  Yeah.  He couldn't open his mouth.  He couldn't really open his mouth or his eyes.  He's just like...  I didn't get that.  You're right.  And he kept just turning his head, but he was fucking great.  Is that what that was?  Oh, okay.  I didn't catch him.  Yeah, he's all fucked up.  He couldn't shut his eyes after the facelift.  Yeah.  And Matt Damon was just watching him sleep with his eyes open.  Sweetie, you're snoring. 
[00:24:00]  Sweetie.  He's called him Sweetie.  Sweetie.  Hot tub together.  Oh, a lot of hot tubbing.  And Matt Damon, who plays Scott Thorson, he fucked him in the ass, but he didn't like  getting fucked in the ass.  And Liberace was annoyed at that.  Yes.  But it turns out that's probably what saved this guy's life.  Because Liberace was taking dick.  Well, right now, Scott is a victim of anal cancer.  Yeah, he is cancer.  Advanced anal cancer.  Oh, God.  He's not in good shape.  He's in jail, I think, right?  Is he? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  How old is he?  He's got to be 50-something now, man.  He was born in...  He was 17.  He was born in 1960.  I think he's 57 or something like that, right?  Maybe?  No?  No, I'm going to guess 63.  No, not that old.  He's 54.  Oh, 54.  He was just a young nubile.  A young adonis.  More importantly, I think Kenny really enjoyed the movie.  You liked it, huh?  How can't you?  Well.  Holy mackerel.  A lot of sex scenes. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There was one where Lee was just being pounded in the ass.  Yeah.  And then he goes to grab a popper, and he's just, oh, oh, banging against the headboard.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They just tell him that Damon, he'll take some, and he won't take any, so he just keeps  fucking his ass.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  He gave it to him like he did.  And then he asked Lee, he's like, how do you stay hard so long and so many times?  He's like, well, I had some implants to put in it.  Did he really, though? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  I had a procedure.  I had a procedure.  Oh, my God.  Was all this...  This is all real shit, according to this guy?  Yeah, I guess so.  No.  I had a procedure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was so creepy.  Yeah.  Talking with the young boys in the fucking dressing rooms and shit.  Yeah.  And then Matt Damon would get all jealous.  And he had Matt Damon surgery to make him look like a young Lee.  Oh, yeah.  He had Scott get operated on to look like him.  And it's so great when Scott first gets brought on the scene and his former protege is just 
[00:26:00]  walking around the house looking around like, oh, fuck this.  Fuck this guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you're the new guy?  Wait till you see what happens.  Yeah.  Matt Damon got rid of the house boy.  Yes.  Well, the house boy wasn't nice to him, in fact.  No, he wasn't.  Who was great?  And that was Dan Aykroyd as the attorney.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He was fucking great.  Don't fuck with my shit.  What did you say?  Don't fuck with my shit.  Yeah.  Don't fuck with my shit.  Now put Lee back on.  Put Lee back on. 
[00:26:30]  Why didn't Aykroyd talk about this movie when he was in here?  Hey, he was selling his Vacker.  Yeah.  You gotta have the crystal head Vacker.  Hey, he's selling his Vacker.  The Vacker.  Borrowed Dice's glasses for the movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The big glasses.  Is it a good movie?  It's great.  Yeah, it really is a good movie.  Michael Douglas has to win a Golden Globe for this.  He was fucking amazing as Liberace.  And Matt Damon was great, too.  The acting was tremendous.  Yeah, Matt Damon was great.  It was well acted.  I think if this was a theatrical release or something, Michael Douglas might be up for 
[00:27:00]  something right there.  Yeah, but he can't win an Oscar for this, can he?  Because it wasn't theatrical?  No, it wasn't theatrical.  Wait, where are they showing this movie?  HBO.  Oh, it's an HBO movie.  Iraq comment?  They were saying they were trying to shop it to all the movie studios, but they wouldn't  touch it because it was too gay.  They didn't know how to sell it.  So HBO was the only one who put the money up to it.  Wait, did someone actually say this movie's too gay?  Yeah, the guy who directed it.  Soderbergh.  Soderbergh said it's too gay?  No, he didn't say it.  He said they were shopping it.  All the studios passed on it.  They said, we don't know how to sell this.  This is too gay.  And they had Michael Douglas and Matt Dillon? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  What dummies.  Matt Dillon?  I'm sorry, Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  And I tell you, that's where Tom Popper met Matt Damon.  And I'm doing a live Come to Popper tonight down at the Village Underground.  And when I did one a few times ago, I told you this handsome guy was up there.  I'm like, who is that handsome fucker?  And it turned out it was Matt Damon.  He came to the show.  You didn't recognize him?  No.  Because he was up there and the girls were looking at him.  He was sitting where we sit, but he was five seats away.  And he had a hat on. 
[00:28:00]  I'm like, that's a handsome fuck.  A hard on?  It kind of annoyed me.  No, I didn't have a hard on.  Oh.  Did he do Tom Popper's show, or he was just checking it out?  He was watching it.  He was watching it.  I'm glad I didn't know it was him, though, because I gave him a great performance, and  I would have sucked if I knew it was him.  Papa has A-listers as friends.  It makes me sick, dude.  It makes me nauseous.  Oh, that was Scott Bakula in there.  And he brought fucking him over to the cellar and hung out with everybody.  I was in there, of course, at home.  Papa knows how to fucking wheel and deal, man.  Bisexual.  Yeah, I think they sensed that Tom might like a little bit of fucking something in his mouth. 
[00:28:30]  Mama and Papa.  Oh, boy.  They only needed $5 million to make the movie, and no studio would give it to him.  But, I mean, how much did Michael Douglas make?  He doesn't make more than $5 million.  He got back in.  Get it?  Get it?  That son of a bitch was great.  I never saw him playing Liberace.  I was like, there's no way he's going to pull this off.  You've got to see the movie now.  And he totally pulled it off, yeah.  Yeah, you really forget that it's him. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, he's had that, like...  But he...  And Matt Damon didn't even play that gay.  Like, he just played the guy.  Yeah.  And Liberace, you felt like, all right, he's gay, but he was still playing a real dude.  It was really fucking good.  All the rings they were wearing to fist each other.  I don't know if they were fisting each other.  Yeah, with the rings on.  That got edited for time.  Oh, I see.  And Matt Damon's character just kept pawning off his rings on the drug dealers and shit.  Just gave away everything. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, it didn't end well.  It didn't end well.  But, you know, it's like Lee did what you should do if you're that guy.  You fuck him young for a while, give him some jewels, and then boot him.  What's he supposed to do?  Marry someone?  He's Liberace.  He's Lee.  What was Liberace's life like at the end there?  Was it shitty, or did he go out on top, career-wise?  I think he was very comfortable at that point.  115 million, I think, he was worth.  He was, I don't know how old he was. 
[00:30:00]  He might close to 65.  I think he was 65.  What did he die of?  Eight.  It was eight.  Yeah, except just people tried to lie about it.  Right, I remember there was like...  They tried saying it was heart failure and stuff, and then they went, no, we're going to do an autopsy.  And then they're like, well, we already embalmed him.  And they're like, well, we got some tissue samples.  So, oh, yeah, it's complication from AIDS.  Wow.  I don't have HIV.  I'm positive.  Easy one.  Oh, boy. 
[00:30:30]  I do keep forgetting about that button.  It's a wonderful button.  It's a wonderful button.  Yeah, no, they showed him with...  They said he did, like, fucking...  He did the Oscars, which was a goal of his and a dream.  And he performed...  How many sold-out shows at Radio City before?  He did, like, 30 or 50?  I think it was 50-something.  50-something consecutive sold-out shows at Radio.  He just did a fucking run.  And I'm telling you, when they show him with fucking AIDS...  Oh, yeah, they really did a good job.  And he calls this guy, I mean, I don't want to blow the movie, but it doesn't matter. 
[00:31:00]  It's fucking true.  It happened.  Yeah.  And he's like, you know, Scott, he's just...  And you look at him.  He looks so fucked up.  Yeah.  It's all just makeup, but...  Yeah, without the wig.  Wow.  They put that real gaunt makeup on him.  Did I make you happy?  The Worst of the Week, Countdown.  On the Colt Anthony Channel.

And after Opie and Anthony Live, you can also hear my show, the Sam Roberts Show,  Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern, here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Still to come on this here countdown, Courtney Love in studio, Maria Menounos in studio,  Bill Burr stopped by, but Ben Mesrick, he wrote the book that the social network was based on. 
[00:36:30]  He wrote Bringing Down the House, which turned into the movie 21.  He's been a friend of the show for many years now.  He tells these fascinating stories, most of which are true.  He was on the show this week.  Unfortunately, he was late.  And Opie and Anthony don't like staying extra minutes.  No extra time.  So he only got a few minutes to pitch his book.  Here is the abridged Ben Mesrick interview.  Number six. 
[00:37:00]  Ted.  Pictures from his iPhone.  You got six and a half minutes.  Six and a half minutes to sign.  I'm not even kidding.  We don't have the ability to stay any later today.  Oh, no.  Yeah, we have to be out.  Yeah, the show after us has to start right at 10 o'clock.  So you have six minutes and seven seconds.  Starting right now.  There it is.  Six-minute interview. 
[00:37:30]  Okay.  Sounds good.  So what's the book about?  Straight Flush.  It's about a group of frat brothers from University of Montana who are like poor kids.  One of them was so poor he sold a cow to buy his first car.  And they used to play poker in a bar, a local bar in the basement.  And they decided to put it online.  And it became one of the largest online poker companies in the world.  They moved their frat to Costa Rica.  You know, lots of girls, hookers and drugs and stuff.  And they were making a million dollars a day.  It became this huge business. 
[00:38:00]  Can you say the name of that?  It was called AbsolutePoker.com.  Oh, this is a real place.  Oh, yeah.  Absolute Poker and Ultimate Bet.  They bought Ultimate Bet.  I've heard of those.  And then the U.S. government decided to try and make poker illegal.  Yes.  And now they're all fugitives.  One's in Antigua in hiding.  One's in Panama.  This is disgusting.  They're all on the run.  And now online poker is becoming legal again.  Yeah.  But these guys still face 80-year indictments and stuff like that.  Well, you know, if...  Wow.  Yeah.  If something becomes illegal, legal.  Right.  It doesn't matter.  But if you did it and it was illegal and you're a fugitive, then you're still a fugitive. 
[00:38:30]  And again, if it's legal when you start doing it, they can kind of grandfather you in.  That's right.  Maybe.  But they were offshore.  They were offshore.  So why are they in trouble?  80% of their players were American.  Oh, I see.  That's how they got them.  So in 2006, two moralizing senators tried to make online gambling illegal.  Bill Frist.  Remember, he was running for president.  Yeah, I met him.  Sure.  Four minutes and 30 seconds ago.  He's conservative.  And so these guys, one of them turned himself in and is now doing 12 months, 14 months in 
[00:39:00]  a federal prison.  That's easy, though.  But what's crazy is they were...  That's easy considering the money he made.  Is he keeping the money?  He had to pay a million dollar fine.  That's easy.  If you're making a million a day, you take the hit, you give the government a million,  you do 14 months in jail.  Standing on your head, right?  Standing on your head.  If you know you're coming out and you got millions.  He might.  We don't know what anybody has left because it was unregulated.  There were no actual regulations.  That's true.  Let me tell you some of the things that I realized happened.  I was playing online poker on one of the sites and stuff, and I was using, I guess,  one of my credit cards. 
[00:39:30]  No, no.  I think it was from, yeah, the credit card.  Right.  And I got an email from them months later that said, well, your credit card company, and  I had already played with the money, lost it, whatever.  Your credit card company is denying payment on this, so if you could just send us the money,  and I'm just like, yeah, all right.  And all I'm thinking is that must have happened to a lot of people.  Oh, yeah.  When the law came down on everything, the credit card companies were like, pfft.  Well, hundreds of millions of players lost everything. 
[00:40:00]  I mean, one day, the Department of Justice raided, and everybody's money just disappeared.  Fucking disgusting.  Wow.  Three minutes and 20 seconds ago.  Oh, jeez.  Wait, wait.  Back to you, though.  How much was it that you were off the hook for?  Probably about.  I know you don't talk numbers.  It's about $1,200.  That's not that much, really, considering how much I was playing on some of those rooms.  You know, I was doing $500 games.  You know what, dude?  That's a lot of money.  You know, you make it sound like nothing because you're rich.  But, you know, for $100 is a lot of money for most of those. 
[00:40:30]  So now what's happening with these guys?  So one of them, I said, turned himself in and went to jail.  One is in Antigua.  He can't set foot off the island of Antigua, or he'll be picked up.  Like even swimming?  He believes that if he goes offshore a certain amount, there'll be like FBI agents in a boat waiting for him.  You make that sound like that's horrible.  It's Antigua.  Well, it's not.  How cool is that?  That's funny, because when I interview him, he's always like in an infinity pool, and he's got like dune buggies and stuff.  But the thing is, it sucks in that he's been there.  He'll be there for the rest of his life. 
[00:41:00]  Whoa.  I mean, when you look at that.  The bird in the gilded cage.  It's the gilded cage.  Is Antigua really nice?  I mean, yeah, it's nice.  It's beautiful, but it's small.  I mean, it's the size of a tiny little village.  You've got to get the fuck out of there at some point.  And he can't get another job.  I mean, he can't work.  Well, what would he get if he left Antigua?  Well, his family.  No, I mean, would he get the same deal, like a year or so in jail and a million dollar fine?  No.  Because he didn't hand himself over, I have a feeling they'd make an example out of him.  That's what he's afraid of.  And he's afraid they'd put him in, like, a real prison.  Oh, shit. 
[00:41:30]  Bernie gets his...  I mean, I'm sorry.  Where they fuck heinies.  Bernie Madoff is not even in that type of jail.  Right.  Bernie Madoff stole a billion dollars, and that hunk of shit is in a minimum security jail.  I mean, talk about absurd.  We were all lining up for Powerball tickets a few weeks ago, right?  And these guys are in jail for a poker.  Yeah, I know.  What's the difference?  What's the sense of that?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  And it's just because they're not getting their cut.  Because they're not getting their taste.  Yeah.  Government needs their taste.  Well, the state of New York went after PokerStars, which was in the same indictment.  And the PokerStars guy paid a $750 million fine to the DOJ in the state of New York, and now he's off. 
[00:42:00]  And, you know, it's like...  So that makes it right.  That makes it okay.  All of a sudden, the right and wrong aspect of it is only money.  It's big money.  It really is crazy.  So why can't this guy fly somewhere else?  Why does he have to...  Oh, no extradition.  Because there's no...  Anywhere he goes, if there's an extradition, he'll probably get grabbed.  He's just afraid of getting picked up.  But can't he go somewhere where...  You always worry if there's an emergency and the plane has to land somewhere, and it's not, you know... 
[00:42:30]  A lot of people that are thinking about going to a place that doesn't have extradition, you've got to consider the fact that maybe there might be a mechanical problem.  Right.  We're diverting the plane to fuck you, Bill.  And the other thing is, it all depends on how badly they want him.  I mean, if they feel like they could get half a billion dollars off of him, they might work hard to get him.  But can't they just drag him in and make up a story?  We found him on a raft a couple hundred yards offshore.  Antigua protects him.  Oh, they do?  Antigua believes that online poker should be legal.  They're right.  And I believe he'd probably put some money into Antigua.  And Antigua... 
[00:43:00]  So on that island, he feels safe.  But he wouldn't feel safe in Costa Rica.  Right.  In Costa Rica, they raided his house and were dragging everything out of his house.  And a couple of the other guys I would meet in Toronto, because they were willing to go to Canada, because Canada has pretty liberal laws.  How about France?  Obviously, Roman Polanski's doing pretty well there.  Well, it's okay if you do that.  It's not okay if you play poker.  Don't play poker, but, you know, a little statutory rape.  Right.  That's a different rule, right?  But it's crazy, man.  It's nuts.  It's all very strange laws. 
[00:43:30]  And horse racing.  You can bet the horses online.  You can bet horse racing.  You can bet all sorts of things.  You can play casinos.  There's a casino 10 minutes from every city in the country, basically.  Right, right.  But lottery, everything.  But, you know, I'm not trying to make these guys out to be saints.  I mean, there was a lot of cocaine and hookers pretty much continuously through the book.  But in terms of what they did with online poker, they shouldn't be facing prison.  Yeah, no way.  Sounds like another great book by you, man.  Thank you.  How many movies have you got?  Well, I mean, the two were made.  And then we're working on this one. 
[00:44:00]  My last book, Sex on the Moon, is at Sony.  And I just sold something to 20th Century Fox with Brett Ratner, the director, who's awesome.  So, I've got a few things going on.  You know what I heard about Sony today?  It just blew my fucking mind.  They're actually thinking about getting rid of the electronics.  The entertainment they were considering, like, spinning off.  And completely getting rid of their electronic sector.  TVs, the games, everything.  Electronic.  Because when they look at the books, it doesn't do anything for their bottom line. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, really?  The electronics.  Do you know what they make most of their fucking money?  Like, all their fucking money.  Sony.  Selling insurance in Japan.  Sony sells insurance in Japan.  That's where their whole fucking shit comes from.  All that electronics, fucking PlayStation, fucking TVs with Sony on it.  Wow.  All your headphones, you this, that.  Nothing.  Good.  You know why?  Because they're so obsessed with their, uh...  What is the...  Nothing they have works with anything else.  Oh, yeah.  Proprietary.  Proprietary shit Sony is terrible with. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Fucking insurance salesman.  Awesome.  It kind of makes sense, though.  Pricks.  Good for them.  This annoyed me.  I actually want to read this, because that story annoys me, that the government got involved  with that shit.  Oh.  Shut it all down.  And, uh, yeah.  Creeps.  Like, whose business is it?  Who cares?  I mean, why?  And now it's becoming...  It's legal in Nevada and New Jersey now.  And why have they decided to make it legal?  Because they finally figured out how to make money off it?  Because as long as they're going to get tax money out of it, the states are always looking  for money, so the first legal online poker company just opened in Nevada, but you have 
[00:45:30]  to be in Nevada.  They triangulate your cell phone.  So you have to have a computer open to play and a cell phone next to it, and then you can  play, and they just ping your cell phone to make sure you're in Nevada.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, someone will figure out a workaround on that.  Of course you would think.  I mean, someone would be anywhere, but slowly it'll go state by state, and then it'll eventually  be back.  Holy shit.  Instantly, I'm like, how can we get past that cell phone thing?  I'll tell you how.  You give somebody a phone when they're in Nevada and tell them just to turn... 
[00:46:00]  How do they know if it's right by your computer?  They know where your phone is, so the location of your phone...  How do they know where your computer is?  Oh, probably the IP address.  IP address.  Yeah, the IP address.  I'm sure there's a way around it, but I mean, if you're really trying that hard, I mean...  Yeah, I mean, just get a ticket and go to the casino.  Yeah, really, just go to Nevada.  It's good that they can track you to play online poker, but we can't figure out a way  to track missing children.  Priorities really stink.  Some is very adult.  Yeah.  You know, we could put a man on the moon.  It's just the priorities. 
[00:46:30]  It's just for them to get their greedy dick beaters on more of your money.  Yes, true.  These are fucking pigs.  Constant.  It's a constant search for your shit.  They can't keep their fucking hands off your money.  I hate that.  Oh, man.  Well, you know what?  What a great book.  What a great interview this has been.  The six minutes.  We actually went a little over.  We actually went a little over.  We go way back with you.  It is good.  So we gave you an extra thread.  Thank you, guys.  And if you want to, you know, hang out, I'm sure Sam Roberts would love to have you. 
[00:47:00]  Of course.  No, he's good.  Really?  Yeah, he's really good.  Sam does the AFL-O-A show.  He looks funny, but he does a good interview.  I don't look funny.  I'm handsome.  He looks stupid.  He looks stupid.  He looks stupid.  He looks like fucking Bozo the Clown in the dressing room before fucking showtime.  All of you are stupid.  Creepy denim shirt.  That is very nicely pressed.  Good one.  Good comeback.  Exactly.  Is that for animals?  No, you're stupid.  You're all stupid.  No, you're stupid.  And Bozo never wore denim, so that makes you even double stupid.  I don't like your fucking two different denim pants and shirt. 
[00:47:30]  I don't like your Black Sabbath t-shirt.  Doesn't like you either.  Black Sabbath is a t-shirt.  Doesn't like or dislike anyone.  Told you.  Stupid.  Been doing a lot of TV, I see.  I'm doing Today Show tomorrow.  That's awesome.  That's weird.  I saw you on TV this morning.  Today Show tomorrow.  Who were you doing?  I was...  Squawk Box.  I guess...  Oh, Squawk Box.  Were you talking from stocks?  I call every girl I dated Squawk Box.  I'm going to remember that one for next time on the show. 
[00:48:00]  Your book has a very long title.  Just say that, yeah.  Ben Mesrick.  Straight Flush, obviously.  The True Story of Six College Friends Who Dealt Their Way to a Billion Dollar Online  Poker Empire and How It All Came Crashing Down.  Out today in all the places you get books these days.  Cool, man.  A little of that collusion going online, too.  It's pretty easy to go in with two or three people.  Oh, there were some cheating scandals.  There's cheating in the book, too.  Yeah.  The companies themselves, there was some cheating.  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah.  But it was kind of cool. 
[00:48:30]  You'd get, like, three guys at a table, and you're either playing from the same room,  or you're texting each other, or have FaceTime opened up, and you're like, what do you got?  So now you all know what each other has.  You know who should be the guy that goes for it, and the other guys just pump up and try  to get the other guys out.  It winds up, you have a much better chance of getting the pump of the whole pot.  Yeah, working together.  But they frowned upon that, I guess.  How do you know that the game isn't cheating you? 
[00:49:00]  It's a fucking computer.  Well, there were a couple times when that did happen.  Hey, he's got two kings.  Should we give him a third?  No, we shouldn't.  No, we shouldn't.  Three of clubs and tell him to eat ass and fucking beat it.  The thing is, the company was making the money off of the rake, so they didn't care what was...  It's like a casino doesn't need to cheat, because they're all going to make all your  money anyway.  As long as you're betting against somebody else, and the pot gets in there, they take  a little percentage of the pot, it doesn't matter who's winning or losing at the table. 
[00:49:30]  No.  Unless they've got some of their players in there, now winning heads on top of that.  They want the guy to get that third king, and they want a guy to get the third ace, and  they want them to bet against each other, get the pot really high, so they wind up making  money.  But yeah, I would assume that if they are playing in the games, and they can control  the fucking outcome...  There was a couple incidents, right?  Yeah.  But they paid back the players once the players found out.  Ain't that nice.  Who found out?  How'd they figure it out? 
[00:50:00]  Players figured it out.  They got a hold of, like, these guys are pretty serious, the players.  They would get 10,000 hand histories, and look at every hand and say, this guy was always  betting at the right time.  How did he know to bet?  And then they analyzed it with mathematical models and figured out someone was cheating.  Oh, wow.  Who was it?  I would just go, I lost a bunch of money.  Yeah.  Yes, I did.  I'm going to nap.  I'm going to nap.  All right, kids.  It's been fun.  Hey, really fun.  Love having you guys.  Sorry about the traffic.  No, no, it's not my phone.  Not you, Jimmy. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, it's New York, you know.  As they say in New York.  Ah, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  That's right.  Good luck with the book.

Worst of the week countdown here on the Opie & Anthony channel, counting down all the great moments on this week's Opie & Anthony show.  I'm Sam Roberts from the Opie & Anthony show and after Opie & Anthony Live. 
[00:55:00]  We're still going to get to Courtney Love and Maria Menounos and Jim Florentine and all that.  Bill Burr as well.  But before we get to any of that, there's a new craze in exercise.  It's called Prancercise.  It took over the Internet towards the end of this week.  We got the woman on the phone.  The woman who created Prancercise.  This form of exercise where you just walk around prancing with pants that are so tight you can see the outline of your vagina.  We got the woman on the phone.  We explained Prancercise to everybody. 
[00:55:30]  And, and a classic character from the Opie & Anthony show made his return.  It's Prancercise here on The Countdown.  Number five.  What's the Prancercise video about?  Can we take a look at that?  This is, yeah, yesterday.  Jimmy thinks it's fake.  I don't think so.  Everyone was tweeting.  I don't think Bill Burr's faked the videos.  She's got a whole website.  You've got to see this, Andrew.  You've got to see this.  And I, I usually steer clear of those things because they're never good.  But I clicked on this and I had to watch the whole thing. 
[00:56:00]  You watched the whole thing?  I watched the whole thing.  I watched like 30 seconds.  She's batshit crazy.  Yeah, I watched some, too.  If it's real, it's entertaining.  But enough with her camel toe.  She's old and a dumb, fat cunt.  Yeah, she's, she really, and she just looks bizarre.  She saw what?  Horses prancing?  She must have seen horses.  Prancing.  She must have.  You know, the little fucking thing they do?  And thought, oh, horses are in shape.  Look at the muscular definition on that horse.  What do they do all day? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, maybe there's a way humans can do that.  So, she prances around.  And it just looks like she's a crazy person walking down the sidewalk.  My mother prancesizes.  She swears by it.  Yeah?  Strengthens your ankles, chipper.  Can we see the video?  Hello, I'm Joanne O'Rourke.  Is it simply?  Look at that wig.  And I'm here today to show you the corvo's prancesized.  That's like a big chemo wig.  I've got my ankle weights in place.  Look at her fucking pussy lips.  And my music's ready. 
[00:57:00]  So, let's stop talking and do some walking.  Oh, boy.  And then the music starts.  And she's just kind of doing a Ministry of Silly Walks walk down.  I fucking love lunatics.  I fucking love them.  The world needs lunatics.  I don't even know what this is.  Like, how would you describe what she's doing? 
[00:57:30]  It's like a light sidestep forward.  Yeah.  And her arms are going, though.  It's...  And she always starts with the same position on the little pathway.  It's a shitty park she found.  Yeah.  What song is this?  It's...  It's a home Alabama.  No, I think it's a generic version of a song Alabama.  Like, you know when we used to get those production pieces that sounded like a sideways version of it? 
[00:58:00]  No, E-Rock nailed it.  It's like a sideways version of...  Okay, now we're going to step up the pace a little bit with the prancesized truck.  It's really hot.  It's really hot.  What's wrong with her mouth?  Her teeth are fucking Alfred E. Newman.  Would you?  Ugh, God.  You would.  I'd squeeze her big pussy.  Would you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are we done? 
[00:58:30]  Well, you've got to bring a big pussy.  Big pussy.  Or big fat pussy.  I went from really enjoying this to...  Let's move on.  Yeah.  Well, that's her trot.  He was eating cronuts two at a time.  Couldn't get a drink at the table.  John Cronut's for the room.  See, I already tapped out of this video at this point.  No, no.  I couldn't.  I had to see what else she was going to do.  Yeah.  She gallops, I think.  Oh, okay.  Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and talk to a bunch of flaky treats like that. 
[00:59:00]  Well, Las Vegas is going to learn the cronut business.  We're going to really cut the noose and let it loose with the prancer-sized gallop.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm back in.  The gallop is terrific.  And this is a fake song.  Tom Petty?  Remember what I'm saying?  Look at this lunatic. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, my God.  This is how she...  But who would buy her takes?  Yeah.  If I'm going to watch it, it's a goof for a minute.  And you can't watch them while you do it.  Right.  Her arms go out to the side.  She's good.  There's no rhyme or reason to what she's doing.  She's very good.  Yeah?  Oh, you like her, Chipper?  Very good, yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Prancer-sized.  It's good for your cankles.  My mother has ankle swelling.  I was watching the beginning of Dust Till Dawn yesterday.  Oh, God, yeah.  And the hostage woman that they take.  That fat.  She's got such cankles.  Oh, they're terrible.  She had ankle weights all the time, and now she's putting them on her wrist.  I'm going to show you the Prancer-sized box or shadow box prance.  It's better to be punching into space than in your face. 
[01:00:30]  Joanna.  Wine time.  Joanna.  Hello?  Hi, Joanna.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you?  I'm doing just dandy.  I'm over here at the Today Show waiting to go in the air.  Oh.  The Today Show's doing a little piece on you.  Boy, you're sure are getting popular with this Prancer-size.  Isn't it amazing?  I knew it was the best thing.  It's been going for so many years, and now the public's getting their teeth into it,  which is so exciting to me, because I always knew it was theirs. 
[01:01:00]  Uh-huh.  I like it.  I like their research.  I like it.  It's really good, because it's good.  I'm good for you.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  You know, they just see this video, and that's what, like, got them, like, all aroused.  But there's so much more to the program, and that's what's so exciting about it.  Oh, it is.  It is exciting.  I want to ask you, how were you inspired by this?  Um, I just really got into a very heavy exercise routine back in 89, and I was out on the 
[01:01:30]  Hollywood Broadwalk down in Florida.  Oh.  And I was like, I started to power walk with ankle weights on, and one day, I had a really  good song on my Walkman, and I started to stretch my legs, like, from side to side.  House next door to me.  And it just kind of evolved from there.  Yeah.  And the rest is history.  I got to tell you, you really know how to move those hips of yours.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, we were noticing.  That's a little, uh, now you've been doing this, uh, what, like, since 1989? 
[01:02:00]  You've been doing this, uh, all the time?  Oh, no, no, no.  You see, there is some misconceptions out there.  Oh, oh.  I did it for many years, but then I had a lot of setbacks and a disability for about nine  years, and I just started up with it again in July.  Oh, in July.  Yeah.  So, and then I didn't start to market it, my book, and my website, and my video didn't  come out until December.  Well, you got a lot of fans calling our show.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  They can't believe we're talking to you right now.  You're about to go on the Today Show, and we're all going to watch that, certainly, Joanna.  Yeah, all right.  Do you have time to take...  We're going to be practicing on it, so it's going to be fun.  Do you have time to take one phone call?  Sure, why not?  Big fan coming in, a guy named Steve, uh, oh, he's calling all the way from, um...  Yellowstone.  Yellowstone.  Oh, wow.  Steve.  Hello.  Hi, Steve.  Hello.  Hi, may I speak to the Prancercise gal?  She's right on there.  She's back there.  Oh, my God. 
[01:03:00]  I've been attempting to Prancercise.  I didn't think I could because I passed away.  But I wanted to know, how did you start Prancercising?  Um, I found some really good music many, many years ago, and when I was power walking, I started  to be more rhythmic with my walk, and it all just, the rest is history.  I was Prancercising something that anybody could do because I had a stomach stapling due  to my obesity.  You can do it as low impact as you want. 
[01:03:30]  You just do it to your own gait, your own rhythm, and it's all yours.  Well, you sound really elated, and that's what it's all about.  We'll have to do it together one day, okay? 
[01:04:00]  You're liberating yourself.  Totally liberating yourself.  But it's just not something I'm sure if I could do or not.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's...  What's that, honey?  I mean, it's for anybody that, even if you have some kind of a physical disability, right?  Oh, sure.  Sure, absolutely.  It's just, you know what your limitations are.  Your own gait is, your own...  Your own rhythm is...  Oh, my God. 
[01:04:30]  Are you a married woman?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  In my book, it tells you more why, my philosophy on that.  I am very single, very want to be single, and all my gratification really comes from my  exercise and enjoying life.  Yeah.  What is gratification?  It comes from me on the other side.  I'm having a little trouble hearing. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, your phone's breaking up a little there, Steve.  Yeah, Steve, you might want to move your mouth away from the phone a little bit.  It's breaking up.  Yeah, yeah.  It's difficult when you haven't been a character in quite a while.  Yes.  You're having to do your cell phone.  Yeah.  Now, do you have some kind of a...  Obviously, are you against the institution of marriage itself, or does male companionship  not interest you at all?  Um, a gender thing doesn't matter to me.  I seek companionship from good people that enjoy the same things as me. 
[01:05:30]  Right.  And, um, it's just, uh, I just never, I'm non-committal.  I'm very, very non-committal.  Ah.  Non-committal.  Yeah.  Now, did you notice in the video that's getting massive amounts of views now, people are loving  it all over?  Did you notice maybe that your pants are a little tight?  You know, sometimes, um, I don't, I, I, I notice now because everyone's really brought 
[01:06:00]  it to my attention.  Oh.  I am so not self-conscious that those things, like, really don't draw my attention like  they do.  Well, they're drawing other people's attention.  Let me tell you something.  And that full, engorged vagina that you have showing in that, your, your, um, your labia,  your labia majora, let me tell you, is pumped up like, uh, like a tractor-trailer tube.  Well, let me tell you something.  As much as the spoof that's going on, it's doing me wonders. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, no, believe me, it's not a spoof.  It's not a spoof.  We adore you.  We've been, we were just watching your video, as a matter of fact, and, uh, everything from  the prancing, from the, uh, the, the wonderful big 80s hairdo, from the, uh, the, the, the  wonderful, uh, uh, uh, vaginal lips.  We love it.  We love you.  Good.  Good.  We love, I love to hear that.  It's getting me more and more, um, outrageous.  It is.  I do something similar called chippisizing.  Chippisizing? 
[01:07:00]  What is that?  What's that?  It's like prancesizing if you chip.  That's terrible.  You're, you're, you're ripping her off.  Oh, my.  She's wonderful.  Were you inspired by watching horses and, and seeing that they are in very good shape?  Um, well, in my book, I, you know, illustrate all that, how they're vegetarians, how they're  symbols of beauty, they're majestic, they're, they're everything that anyone could aspire  to as far as beauty and, and strength.  Your vagina, your vagina almost reminds, your vagina almost reminded me of when I used to  feed my horse a sugar cube.  I'd have to keep my hand very flat, and his lips would go, and they'd pick it up. 
[01:07:30]  It's wonderful.  Very attractive.  And I'm giving you so much amusement and entertainment.  Oh, absolutely.  It's wonderful.  We love Joanna.  And that's, that's, that's what the world should be all about, is having fun, staying  in shape, and laughing with each other.  Let me ask you this, Joanna, after the, after the Today Show, where are you going?  Um, I have another interview, I think it's with OMG, and then I go back to Florida.  No, no, no, no. 
[01:08:00]  How about.  She's going on River Monsters, where they'll be noodling for her vagina.  How, how about you stop by the Opie and Anthony show, and have a cronaut with us?  I wish I could, but we've got to catch a plane.  I, I had fun, guys.  Oh, thank you.  And I'm glad you did, too.  Thank you so much, and a continued success.  With the Prancercise.  With Prancercise.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  There she goes, Joanna.  She's wonderful.  The star of the Prancercise.  She's wonderful.  Video.  What a zest for life she has.  Boy, something tells me that book's probably got a real downer part in it. 
[01:08:30]  Holy fucking big casino.  Oh, you think so?  Yeah.  You think there's a chapter called Life Without Them?  Oh, my God.

The worst of the week countdown continues.  You are tuned in.  It's the worst of the week countdown, highlighting the great things that all happened this week  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm Sam Roberts from the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots of people were in studio this week. 
[01:13:30]  Courtney Love, Maria Menounos.  One of the most important ones was saying hello to our old friend Bill Burr, a guy who  used to be on the show all the time.  He's since moved out to L.A., so we don't get to see him quite as often.  But his career is taken off to the moon.  He's in movies.  He's on TV shows.  He's back on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.com for all his tour dates.  For all your comedy needs. 
[01:14:00]  You're pretty much away all summer, huh, Bill?  Yeah, I've got to pay off my death note.  Death note.  Holy shit.  No, I am, dude.  I'm trying.  Like, that's my retirement.  I just, I'm going to just pay that thing off.  And then someday, you know, when this business is done with me, I'll just sell it.  And I don't know what.  Just go live.  Live off the land.  Well, live on one of those silver trailers.  Yeah, at this point, if I'm not, you know, we're not in a police state and I'm required 
[01:14:30]  to live in a mega city.  I love it.  I can't stand the fact that you're never done.  You're never done with this shit.  Like, when you say, oh, I'm retiring or I'm doing this, you're still filling out your paperwork  and fucking taxes and things.  You're still accountable to the government for your property tax.  Oh, I paid my house off.  Oh, you did?  How about if you don't pay your property tax?  They'll just take your fucking house that you paid off, that you bought, that is your  house.  No, the reason why it's so fucking long, too, is it's so brilliant. 
[01:15:00]  Because by the time you get it finished, you're so fucking old.  It's just like the kids are out of the house.  I can't go up the stairs anymore.  And then you sell it for some, you know, whatever, and you get out.  Shitty price, yeah.  Your liver fails or whatever, and you're out.  And then they get another 30, 35-year-old, and they fucking put that death note on him.  Dude, it just freaks you out.  Like, you drive, everything you look at, they own.  Yeah.  And even if they don't own it, they're getting it back when whoever owns it dies.  So, and however much it costs, it took so fucking long to pay it off. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Dude, what kills me is it's just, it's what fucking kills, it'd be one thing if they were  like these fucking gangsters.  Yeah, yeah.  And they look like, you know, those UFC guys with the shaved head, and it's just like,  that guy's going to snap my neck.  I'm not going to say shit.  I got it.  But to just walk into a bank and look at these cunts on the other side of the desk.  A little pencil neck.  Now, I'm not saying some of them don't go down to a dojo.  I'm not saying, but I'm just saying.  To have this level of power, it just, it kills you. 
[01:16:00]  But I don't think the level of power is on the people that you or me see on a daily basis.  They're just slobs like we are trying to eek a living by.  It's the unnamed people.  It's the people that, it's the person that was written on that check of yours.  Who is that?  What?  A consortium.  A fucking building.  But this is the thing.  I always came in and talked about that shit, and you guys were always saying that I was going  down the fucking rabbit hole, and I was nuts.  And I'm going to tell you, I remember when I tweeted you, Rolling Stone actually did. 
[01:16:30]  I mean, they're fucking so left, it's ridiculous.  Yeah.  But they were saying, like, apology to conspiracy, as far as that went.  Right.  You know, not the lunar landing and all that shit.  Because they were kind of breaking down how all of this stuff works.  And, like, I actually, at one point, I was sitting, talking to a banker at my bank,  and we started talking about that shit, and he was, like, lowering his voice.  He's just going, like, he's literally going, like, yeah, man, you know, it's insane.  Have you ever seen, like, that Zeitgeist thing? 
[01:17:00]  Like, no, that was the 9-11 one.  I don't know what the fuck it was, but he started talking about it, too.  And it's like, this guy, this guy, and it's like, how can you be in this thing?  He's in the machine.  But you don't even...  He's just a fucking...  No.  He's a wingnut on the back panel of the machine.  But the reason why he stays in it is his money is stuck in it, too.  He has a death note.  And he's literally sitting there, like, shining Darth Vader's shoes every day.  Because that's how he fucking makes his money.  And he's sitting there, like, I almost got nervous. 
[01:17:30]  Like, you know, somebody's going to step out of a wall, and both of us, you know, chloroform rag,  and we're going to disappear.  It's like, dude, not here.  Not here.  Are we supposed to be doing the Joe Pesci with a hand over our mouth?  Sitting in a garage with the radio on?  No, I am with you.  We used to fucking sit here and go, oh, Bill.  Oh, Bill.  I think everyone's all in now.  It's so obvious and out there now.  I'll tell you one of the greatest things you'll ever do, too, is have Joe Rogan talk to you 
[01:18:00]  for maybe 43 seconds about why the lunar landing didn't happen,  and you're just 100% convinced.  It's the greatest thing.  He was going, he goes, Bill, all the technology we had, we had three-stage rockets to get us out of this.  He goes, so how the fuck did that thing get back off of the moon?  What's that little, the top part that's just left?  How the fuck did it?  Well, you have barely the gravity that we have of Earth,  and no atmosphere to speak of for friction with the air. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah?  So, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's the Bill I love.  Oh, yeah.  All right, I agree with the banks, but now you're back to talking crazy.  Well, who filmed it when it takes off from the fucking moon and that camera pans up?  Yeah, they set a camera there with a remote.  Is that what they did?  Yeah.  Is that what they did?  What did that camera look like?  Because I remember what that fucking camera looked like in 1988. 
[01:19:00]  What exactly did that fucking camera look like?  It was a big, boxy-looking camera.  Big, giant, typewriter-looking thing that you could control remotely.  Covered in silver monar.  Yeah, it was.  Yeah.  From what?  From the lunar module.  It was able to track the lunar module as it took off.  Jesus, with this Star Trek horseshit.  You know what should be going on right now as you tell this story?  That sound effect of when the doors opened on the Star Trek.  Whoosh.  Yeah, that whoosh.  Whoosh.  No, I completely believe it. 
[01:19:30]  And I don't even know what I'm talking about.  He starts talking about solar flares and this shit where it's just like, I don't know,  these blasts of fire just go through space.  Can we find this?  It's the next time Joe comes in.  I don't want to put him on the spot, but I sat there.  He really believes it didn't happen.  It's standard, but unlike me, he's probably wanting to punch me in the face because he's  actually read up on it.  We had Buzz Aldrin in just, what, last week?  Buzz Aldrin had punched the guy in the face for saying that it didn't happen.  No, no, no, no. 
[01:20:00]  He punched him in the face because he called him a coward.  Coward.  And he's from that generation where them's fighting words.  Them's fighting words.  I've got to tell you this right now.  I've got to commend that doughy jackass that he, because if I took that punch, I would  have gone down.  He fucking nailed that dude.  You know what?  That's what I love.  You see, like, that dude's back fat, like, ripples.  Yeah, yeah.  He just took, I was right, right.  I almost think because he caught him so flush in the face, it's almost like taking a bump  in wrestling where you have it go all across your back somehow, across his face. 
[01:20:30]  Yes, Sam.  No, that would have been it for me.  I think Joe Rogan, it's the same shit I've heard for years.  It's nothing new.  It's the same we didn't land on the moon stuff.  And it's all been refuted by, not just NASA, by other scientists that have absolutely viable  solutions as to why we were on the moon and why every one of these reasons that we weren't  has been...  No, but I don't want to hear it from them.  That's like somebody's accused of murder, and he'll tell you why he didn't do it. 
[01:21:00]  I want to hear somebody outside of that...  You know, I'm so full of shit.  I don't even know what I'm talking about.  I'm just tapping out.  What do you got on this, Sam?  Yeah, I don't...  Sam's got something.  I don't believe...  I think everything's bullshit, Sam.  I think everything is.  Rogan is saying now that Moon Landing was probably real.  Oh, Rogan?  Yeah, he went back on what he said.  They got to him.  Yeah.  They got to him.  Well, you listen to somebody give an argument as to why it didn't happen.  It makes me like, wow, that guy, that's fucking right.  It never happened.  Yeah.  And then you hear somebody who knows what they're talking about refute it.  You go, oh, I guess it did.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  That's how I felt when I first...  I watched one about why it didn't happen.  I'm like, fuck.  That's very compelling.  Well, Jimmy's a JFK...  One guy did it.  Oswald guy, yeah.  But I wasn't for many years.  One guy.  The current...  You changed your...  Oh, I argue...  Your complete opinion on the whole thing.  In favor of conspiracy for many years.  Hard.  Forever.  Now you're convinced it was just Oswald.  Yes.  This is coming from Dr. Steve, by the way.  Amateur astronomer.  Physician.  Space buff.  Amateur physician.  Amateur physician.  The current Mars orbiter took pictures of the Sirius, S-I-R-I-U-S, Apollo landing sites. 
[01:22:00]  I suppose those are fake, too, though.  No, no.  I'm asking...  Sorry, not the Mars orbiter.  Of course, the moon orbiter.  Yes.  Did they have the car?  Did they take a...  Just take a picture of the car just to shut me up.  They took a picture of the lunar landing site.  They have pictures of the car.  They do.  They were able to actually take pictures of those things.  And the lunar orbiter did take pictures. 
[01:22:30]  There were pictures online.  Okay, but the banks.  We have the banks now.  Let's see the pictures online.  Fucking banks.  Find pictures of lunar landing sites.  Yeah, find lunar landing site.  Oh, come on.  Now it looks silly because there's nothing there.  Sam, I can't.  Astronaut footprints.  Scientific instruments.  What?  Limb shadow.  You can't see it.  Lunar module.  That's the back of a Nestle crunch bar.  That's the shadow.  They just shot it in black and white. 
[01:23:00]  I can see the lunar platform right there.  The lunar module platform.  No, you can't.  Why?  Sure.  Because there's a thing that says lunar module and there's an arrow pointing to it.  That is true.  It's hard to tell.  That is very hard to tell.  It's the Apollo 14 site.  Oh, there's the scientific instruments.  I like how...  We need better pictures.  Yeah.  A little clearer.  Yeah.  Hey, Dr. Steve, stand down. 
[01:23:30]  That's an old picture.  That couldn't be a new picture.  That has to be an old photo.  Oh, that's going to be an Apollo 14.  All right.  No, no, no.  Sorry, Dr. Steve.  No, that was...  That's the Apollo 14 site as taken by something else.  Oh.  I don't know what, though.  Yeah, that's a horrible picture.  Or perhaps it was from the command module.  I think that was from Apollo 14.  Charlie Chaplin's flip phone.  Right.  The old flip phone that the guy's walking around with.  They have a few of those now online.  They found more?  They have video of something, a film taken back in the 20s and 30s and stuff. 
[01:24:00]  And it's like, look at those persons on their cell phone.  They're not.  They wouldn't be walking around in front of everybody else.  Yeah.  I tell you not to call me in this fucking era.  I'm in the 1920s.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Dude, can I call you back?  Can I call you back?  I'm dealing with prohibition.  Yeah.  We got a guy that has a little more on the Rogan thing.  Robert, go ahead, buddy.  Yeah.  Neil deGrasse Tyson or Neil Tyson deGrasse, whatever, that astrophysicist was on Rogan's show. 
[01:24:30]  And he's the one that convinced Rogan.  Rogan was talking about the film and how he believed that the different film clips were faked up on the moon.  And the physicists pointed out that to fake the video, to make everything in that environment react the way it would in a weightless environment, actually took more science to do that than it would have actually taken to have gotten to the moon.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I just...  A conspiracy of that magnitude.  And then...  That's how it always falls apart with me. 
[01:25:00]  When it gets to the point of how many people would have to be involved and everybody keeps their mouth shut.  That person talks.  Again, why do it six times also?  All right, I'm an idiot.  Like, if you got away with it once with Apollo 11, wouldn't you be like, all right, that's it for the lunar program?  You don't do it again six more fucking times and fake it and no one talks all of those times?  It's so ludicrous to think.  I know, but the banks.  The banks.  I agree with the banks. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  What was the soda can they said?  A lot of the moon people say there was a soda can in the original clip.  You could see it in the foreground.  Oh, my God.  Oh, they have the most nonsensical shit.  Did you see that kid from Philly?  I retweeted the video when he was talking about how he found the real bombers in Boston.  And he just took like a...  He just had a picture of a guy with a backpack.  Yeah.  And he ends it like talking shit.  What did he say?  He said something like...  Something like, boom, nailed it.  I can't remember what he said. 
[01:26:00]  Was it one of those amateur investigators that were all over the fucking internet during the bombing?  It was like they took crowd shots and were like, this guy, this guy.  No, that's what I love.  Because I'm an idiot, but I'm not a complete idiot.  I'm not going to sit there and listen to somebody who's compiling news footage versus experts who are actually at the site.  It's like, yeah, but if you look at this clip from fucking CNN.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at this guy here.  His backpack looks very heavy.  His mannerisms are not indicative of somebody. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, look, now he doesn't have the backpack on.  Well, you can't see it.  He's behind somebody.  Yeah, but if you could, you could see he didn't.  The worst is yet to come.

Worst of the Week Countdown with myself, Sam Roberts, from the Opie and Anthony Show and After Opie and Anthony Live, highlighting all of the great moments that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show.  So, we still have to highlight Courtney Love and Maria Menounos, but first, we had Jim Florentine in studio. 
[01:31:00]  Bob Levy called in.  Who doesn't like a good road story?  Bob Levy and Jim Florentine were on the road together for a long time.  At one point, I'm not even going to tell you what they were known as.  I was about to tell you what they were known as, but why blow that punchline in the intro?  That's stupid.  Jim Florentine, Bob Levy, telling road stories.  I really want to say the name.  I'm not going to tell you.  They called themselves a tag team. 
[01:31:30]  It's funny.  And here it is.  Bob Levy's on the line.  What?  Bob, are you allowed to even call our show?  I'm scared.  I don't know.  It's halfway.  I don't know.  I talked to Howard Stern.  He said you guys were good guys.  Oh, good.  Good.  Yeah, but I want to talk.  Now, Anthony, you would definitely bang her on the road.  There's no doubt about it, because we've all been on the road.  I've been on the road with Florentine, and he is probably one of the creepiest motherfuckers 
[01:32:00]  I've ever been on the road.  Wow, what a compliment.  That's nice.  That is a compliment.  Yeah, absolutely right.  What's into the greatness he would do?  Every time we got to a hotel, we would start moving out tables and chairs, and so the women  couldn't sit there.  They'd have to sit on the bed.  You would set up the room ahead of time?  Yeah, yeah.  That's fucking brilliant.  We'd take all the furniture out of the room, because we'd get a girl back.  They'd go all the way in the corner and sit in that little chair they had. 
[01:32:30]  So where'd you put the furniture?  We'd throw it in the emcee's room, whoever was opening.  Like, you'd chuck everything in there.  That is brilliant.  So you bring them back.  They've got to go right to the bed.  That eliminates that step.  Brilliant.  From them sitting in the chair like, hi.  It's a time saver.  Huh?  And what we'd do is, it was a half hour that was out of the game, that we didn't have  time for them to sober up.  We always had liquor.  The bathtub was full.  We smelled like dog shit after the first day, but we didn't give a shit.  And fucking, we would bring furniture in the hallway, and people would go, like, are you 
[01:33:00]  going to do that to our room?  We're like, no, we don't work here.  Yeah, we'd have couches.  There was couches lined up in the hallway.  We'd be taken out like movers.  Get this one out of here, too.  And if the emcee, we didn't have an emcee, we'd just leave it in the hallway.  Right.  Because chicks would always go to that couch or that chair.  And you can't get them to the bed.  It's a creepy move.  So you're getting rid of two hours easy right there.  They sit right on the bed.  That's brilliant, Jim.  Wow.  What Jim would do was, like, I'd have one with my arm around her, and Jim would tell 
[01:33:30]  a horrible joke, and I would laugh out of control, and I would choke her backwards  onto the bed.  What a move.  We lied to women out in Canada.  We told them we were in bands from England.  We would do shitty English accents and that shit.  And I'm telling them, I'm in a bad, I'm just playing here.  That's great. 
[01:34:00]  And we're going back.  We're fucking pulling out strippers out of the club.  Jim would call up and go, what time is the last girls go on?  11 o'clock.  Well, stick ready.  We've got to be there at 10, too, because we've got to get them fresh when they're off  the stage.  We're fresh meat.  Next thing you know, we're dragging out two at a fucking time.  It was unbelievable.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, Levy's move with girls after a show was he would give them his hotel room key  and go, hey, come back to my room at 324.  I've got to make a phone call.  I've got to call my son or something like that.  He'd make up something. 
[01:34:30]  Because he didn't want to go to the other bar with them, the local bar where they always  wanted to go party.  Because you don't want to go to, you're going to get in a fight.  Yeah.  Because all those guys in that bar have been trying to fuck her since high school.  And all of a sudden, the comedian comes in and she comes in trying to show him off.  It's trouble.  So Levy would go, look, I've got to go back, call my son.  He's been sick or whatever.  So why don't you go back to my room later?  I'm in 324.  Here's my room key.  He would get like five room keys when we'd check in.  How many do you need?  I need five.  Five?  Yeah, I lose a lot of them.  And he would just hand them out to chicks.  Here.  324.  Levy's like, I'm not doing the work. 
[01:35:00]  If they show up, they show up.  If not, so Levy's like, I waited to jerk off to like three in the morning when I knew  they weren't going to show up.  That was your out time, three o'clock.  You've got to have a time set.  One time I went down to get another key because I actually did lose it.  And they go, sir, we don't have any more.  Yeah, we don't have any more.  Wow.  That's great.  It was a good move.  And at like a 130 or so, a girl would show up.  And he's like, I didn't have to.  Yeah, I didn't have to go buy her more drinks.  None of that stuff.  Yeah, why fucking just bank on one? 
[01:35:30]  And the best thing was, one show we did in Baltimore, I get off stage, I'm making out  with this hot blonde within three seconds, Jim.  Remember that?  He didn't, he just walked off the stage and two feet, he starts making out with us, go  in front of the whole crowd.  Jesus.  So she goes, look, I got to go out with my friends.  We're having a bachelorette party.  So meet me at my hotel room.  I'm in 324 in like an hour.  So I drive Levy.  It's like 20 minutes away.  I drive him.  I drop him off.  He goes, all right, I'll see you in the morning.  The chick was really hot.  He gets there and I pulled away.  I'm like, all right, he's good. 
[01:36:00]  I pull, he knocks on the door.  This is like trying to be pulling before a phone, like cell phones, basically.  Yeah.  So he has no idea.  So he knocks on the door.  A guy answers the door in the hotel room.  He's like, who are you?  And the guy's like, who are you?  He's like, who are you?  Who are you?  He's like, is Amanda here?  He's like, yeah, she's sleeping.  He goes, well, who are you?  He goes, I just met her a little while ago.  She brought another guy back.  Oh, man.  So Levy shows up and the guy's like, well, he goes, well, I'm not leaving.  And Levy's like, well, I'm not leaving.  So the guy's like, I don't know what this is. 
[01:36:30]  I couldn't get a ride.  He couldn't get a ride.  I dropped him off.  So I didn't have a sitting one before cell phones.  So Levy's like, fuck it.  I'm not leaving.  So he goes in the chair in the corner room and just sits there as that guy goes back  in bed with her.  And then he's like, fuck this.  I'm not doing it.  So then he crawled in bed and he slept with a couple.  I swear to God.  And they woke up in the morning.  The girl's like, Levy's still sleeping.  She's like, who is that guy?  And the guy's like, I don't know.  He said he knows you.  She goes, I never saw him before.  And Levy wakes up.  I was the comedian last night. 
[01:37:00]  What a fucking creep to go into bed with a couple.  That is pretty fucking creepy, dude.  Look, he's yelling.  It's not my fault.  He's a fucking filthy whore.  I mean, one time, Jim's in Canada.  This girl comes up to him.  She uses a guy's name that was probably the stupidest, weirdest name.  I don't know if you remember it, Jim.  But she goes.  It was Curtis.  Curtis.  That's it.  Curtis. 
[01:37:30]  And Jim goes, uh, yeah.  And tell him that story.  What you did.  We're going to somebody's wedding.  We're on their way to the wedding.  She thought it was this guy, Curtis, from some band in Canada.  I think I told the story.  That's fine.  Tell it again, though.  That's great.  Yeah.  So she thought I was Curtis.  She's like, are you Curtis?  I'm like, yeah.  And she's like, you remember me?  I'm like, uh, I think so.  Your hair's a little different.  That's what you always say to chicks.  Because their hair, even the day before, it's different.  Your hair's a little different. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It is.  I just got it.  Yeah, you noticed.  Yeah, yeah.  Sheesh.  Yeah, yeah, sheesh.  You are magic makers.  God damn, Martin is great.  So long story short, next thing I know, I'm like making out with her.  And she's like, and she says to Levy, can you believe what he did to me?  Can I tell him?  I go, yeah.  I don't know what I did to her.  Oh, shit.  She's like, I met him.  He was in a band.  I met him one night.  We went back to his apartment.  We had sex.  And it was a blizzard.  It was up in Canada.  She goes, and then he told me I had to leave. 
[01:38:30]  And he made me walk home in a blizzard, like three miles.  And you never called me again.  I'm like, I'm sorry.  It sounds like something I would do.  Curtis is just as big a scumbag.  I know.  I thought I was working with Curtis.  The real Curtis.  It's so easy to lie.  I'm telling you.  You go out of town and just go into a bar and tell them you're a doctor, you're anything.  You know what I mean? 
[01:39:00]  Why waste time?  You know what I mean?  I wanted to get laid on stage so bad one night, right?  A while back.  And I go, how do you want me to bring me up?  I go, say I'm going to be Joey's cousin, Joey's brother on Friends next year.  They bring me up like this on that.  I got fucking ten women all over me.  I pick one and get out of there.  It is so simple.  It's so money hung to be fucking whores.  It's the greatest fucking thing.  Holy shit. 
[01:39:30]  Just to think of this shit is brilliant.  Huh?  Norton would get upset when he goes, I got to come.  We're going to get laid and that shit.  And fucking he comes on a gig.  He's fucking kicking and screaming.  It's just nothing happened that night.  And Jim actually got a girl.  And that's the night that you came up with a great idea to jerk off on a TV.  That'll teach Jim when he comes home to watch SportsCenter.  And he's both jerked off on the TV.  And Jim walks in and looks at him and goes, nice.  And just goes to bed. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, because we were all sharing a room.  There was two beds and two double beds.  And I went up going out with this girl.  And they stayed there.  So to get even at me, they say, we're going to jerk off on the TV screen in the hotel.  And I come back and I go, what is that on the screen?  And I go, we jerked off.  And I'm like, nice.  And I just went to bed like it's going to bother me.  Even if it was my own TV, it wouldn't bother me.  I think it bothered me more watching Norton do it than when you see it. 
[01:40:30]  Jerking off on the TV.  Who comes up with that?  Holy fuck.  It happens.  That's what makes our life so great.  When we were on the road, we were called the load warriors.  Who called you the load warriors?  Bob made that up.  I don't think people will walk around going, uh-oh, here's the load warriors.  One time, Bob, one time we're doing this gig in upstate New York.  And this girl was talking to Bob after the show. 
[01:41:00]  And he was sure she was going to come back to the hotel room.  And I knew she was.  And I could see the vibe.  It wasn't happening.  He's like, no, she's definitely coming back.  And I was in the room next to him.  And he's like, I'm telling you, she's going to come back.  I go, Bob, she's not.  So I was like, you know what?  I have to do this.  I went to the frigging phone book.  I called the frigging escort service up.  And I ordered a hooker to leave his room.  So like 45 minutes later, I'm almost out of sleep.  And I hear this screaming in the hallway.  Who are you?  I'm not fucking paying.  It's like, yes, you are.  I drove 45 minutes. 
[01:41:30]  Somebody's paying.  I didn't order yet.  And screaming going on.  And I'm in my bed frigging giggling.  I had to leave a credit card.  And I got Shirley Hempel on my side.  Yeah.  Some big, fat, black chick showed up.  He's like, I'm going to go get my pimp.  And you don't pay me.  I know your hotel room.  He's like, I didn't order you.  Wow.  Fuckin' a chicken in a fuckin' condom.  And I got to pay this fuckin' bitch because of Jim.  Oh, fuck.  Fuck, that's great.  We did all the fuckin' time to each other. 
[01:42:00]  And that's what made it so much fun to be on the road.  No shit.  Going on there, being creepy fucks, and picking up women was such an easy thing.  People make it seem like it's so fucking hard.  All you got to do is bullshit them.  And it was so simple.  Sounded like you were trading quality in, though, for a little bit of quantity.  But, you know, it's the road.  Yeah, it is.  That's the fuckin' hot chicks, man.  I'm telling you.  Really fuckin'.  We were pulling strippers out of Canada. 
[01:42:30]  We went to a strip club.  I don't know how we found the hotel next to it.  There was only seven people in the whole place.  And they were all Canadian and had, like, flannel shirts on and this and teeth.  We walk in there, we're like fuckin' Brad Pitt.  We would get, like, fuckin' three of them.  How many back in the room?  Yeah.  You remember?  Until you got the fat one the last night and embarrassed them?  Wait, what happened?  Wait, Voss has the creepiest story.  My favorite story of all time. 
[01:43:00]  He's doing, like, a Tuesday night at Rascals down at Jersey Shore.  Picks this girl up in his little motel.  $60 or whatever, right?  So he pulls and she goes, yeah, let's get a room.  He's like, okay.  So they get in the parking lot.  And they fool around in the parking lot.  So he, you know, she must have blown him in the parking lot or whatever.  So now she's like, okay, well, are you going to go get the room?  He's like, yeah, yeah.  So he's walking to the front desk.  He's like, well, I just blew a load.  I don't need to get a room now.  So he's trying to figure out how to get out of it.  So he comes back to the car.  Meanwhile, there's no cars in the parking lot. 
[01:43:30]  It's one of those motels where you pull the car right up to the doors.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's nobody there because it's a Tuesday.  Nobody's staying at that shitty motel.  Yeah, yeah.  It's in the winter in the Jersey Shore, so nobody's there.  So then he comes back to the car.  He's like, ah, they're sold out.  She's like, what are you talking about?  There's no cars.  He goes, no, there's a bunch of buses in the back.  Put some tours so there's no rooms.  Not walk home in the snow.  Oh, God.  What a creep.  We finally got, we had strippers like every night, seven nights. 
[01:44:00]  We got them, boom, boom, boom.  The eighth night, we're ready to leave the next day, right?  Nothing.  We can't do nothing.  I look up, I'm looking for Jim, and I see Jim, what looks like he's standing next to  a cigarette machine, but it's actually a woman.  And he gives me this creepy smile and wave.  We drag her to the room.  You know, we always said we had food or whatever.  We got her into the room, and Jim starts making the train noise, like we're going to pull a 
[01:44:30]  train, like I'm going to be part of this train.  Oh, God.  There's no way I'm going on that fucking train.  Yeah.  But, like, in the morning, the guy thought we were idols, the guy that worked at our front  desk.  So Jim told her, he tells her in the car, he goes, I need you to duck, because we're not  allowed to have guests.  He had her duck for seven miles, and so he wouldn't be seen.  He had, what a scumbag. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, God.  I mean, that's, you know what I mean, that's fun.  I mean, to me, that's fun.  I don't know.  Well, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's a long time ago.  You grow up.  Yeah, there you go.  That's always the excuse.  That was long ago.  Of course.  You know, it's like in college years.  You do that stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sure.  You know, I didn't go to college, so.  You get your college in on the road.  Yeah.  Fucking leave.  That's great.  Hey, isn't it going to be great stories for our kids when they grow up? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, I don't know how to explain that one.  Yeah, how do you tell those?  I'm like, son, look, get a fatty every once in a while.  You want to bust out of a slump.  You want to bust out of a slump?  I'll tell you what.  Yeah, those Canadian women love bourbon, don't they?  Yeah.  They love bourbon.  We brought one emcee.  We wouldn't even, like, we wouldn't get him in another room because he just wanted to come to see his family.  We made him sleep in the bathtub, and he started screaming because the girl wouldn't fuck him.  He's cursing her out from the bathtub. 
[01:46:00]  I mean, it was just a total fucking wreck.  But, like, he didn't care.  I mean, Jim, the first time we pulled the train together, he's, like, with the girl, and he's like,  And I'm like, what?  He's like, And I'm like, what are you going to say?  He goes, take your dick out.  And then I took my dick out, and he looks at it, and he goes, I can't follow that.  Yeah, Levy's packing, like, eight and a half.  It might have shrunk over the years, but.  But you got a hammer, huh, Levy?  It got bigger.  It got fucking bigger, man. 
[01:46:30]  After every marriage, I make sure it gets fucking bigger.  Is this another ploy?  You go on the radio and tell people you got a big dick.  You guys work great.  He's now using us.  Another fucking perverted Martin Lewis.  He's fucking using us now, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  How many times have you been.  I used to go on a radio show, and I'd talk about my dick, and he'd go, no, it's huge.  And you'd go, no, yes, it's bigger now.  It's bigger.  Yeah, it doesn't grow.  No.  Everybody shrinks eventually.  How many times have you been married, Levy? 
[01:47:00]  I don't want to brag, but.  How many times are you up to?  I killed a dinosaur with my dick.  Three.  Yeah, I got her in my yard.  You're up to your third marriage?  Yeah, yeah.  Guess what the good thing is?  She told me, well, it was like, she told me bad news.  Like, she just got, she works with the elderly.  I guess that's why she likes me.  But she got a raise where she's taken over buildings in Cleveland.  And she goes, I'm going to have to move there.  And I'll be away for six months.  And I'm like, oh, my God, that's horrible. 
[01:47:30]  And actually, I'm just, like, fucking jumping up and down, fucking giggling.  So the marriage is going well?  It's going well.  I think it's going to be better.  I can see, you know, if you live next door to each other, that's cool.  But fucking another state?  How fucking great is that?  Jesus.  Nothing tops this.  Nothing tops this story.  All the stuff that I did, Voss, whatever.  Levy, one of his marriages.  The first day he gets back from his honeymoon.  We have to drive to South Carolina in the car. 
[01:48:00]  So I'm in the car with him for 14 hours saying how he's a changed man.  He's never going to do it again.  He finally found the love of his life.  I'm so happy.  I don't have to screw girls in the road anymore.  I'm going to focus on my career.  I'm going to go right back to the hotel room after the show and write new jokes  and get some sleep and get up early and start exercising.  I can't, but, Jim, you don't understand the feeling of meeting your matchmaker,  your frigging, your whatever, fucking soulmate or whatever.  He's going, I'm like, all right, enough.  Enough.  You're like, no, you don't understand. 
[01:48:30]  I am just the happiest.  I am so happy.  I don't have to do that stuff anymore.  I don't have to flirt with girls, talk to them.  Oh, true freedom.  Look at that.  That night.  It was the greatest feeling.  That night, after the show, he gets blown by a stripper.  Jesus.  What happened?  The day he's back from his honeymoon.  What happened?  That 16-hour ride, I had to listen to that shit, and that night he caved in.  Oh, my God.  That quick.  That night.  Jesus.  Hey, look, guys.  It was a long ride.  Well, true.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:49:00]  You can't expect a guy to stay faithful with his soulmate.  You know, it's a long ride.  Not even one that you're just back from your honeymoon.  That's supposed to be the happiest time of your life.  Oh, you just know it's fucking doomed.  I guess a girl likes my tan from Jamaica.  I don't know.  My tan from Jamaica.  Jesus.  Why would you get married three times?  Because I'm one of those people that can't do anything for themselves.  I don't want to get up and do something. 
[01:49:30]  Like, if I tell her, honey, I need premium for coffee, can you go to the store?  Like, I'm one of those guys.  He doesn't.  Yeah, he needs to be taken care of.  He has to be in a relationship, and he needs to be taken care of.  He doesn't like to.  He likes them to do everything.  That's a personal assistant.  Yeah, pack his suitcase and do all of that stuff.  Buy his clothes.  He doesn't like to do any of that stuff.  But the sacrifice.  Yeah, I know.  It's amazing.  It's always a mess.  The downside is you're married.  The upside, yeah, you're getting some stuff done, but fuck that. 
[01:50:00]  No, I mean, I like it because she's more normal.  This one, I believe you both, you know, Jim and Jim can say that.  You guys met her, too.  She's very nice.  She's from Cleveland.  No, she's cool.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  She understands.  I can tell her these stories, and she laughs.  You know what I mean?  We have a comic friend that did the biggest scumbag move, this friend, Artie Fletcher.  Jim knows him.  Sure.  After his first...  Wait a minute.  You called him a comic?  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow. 
[01:50:30]  I love when they bash each other.  After his first marriage, he's on his honeymoon in, like, Jamaica.  They start drinking at, like, noon, him and his wife.  She gets so drunk, she passes out.  He brings her up to the friggin' hotel suite, meets another girl back at the little tiki bar  at the pool, and fucks her on the beach.  Wow.  On his honeymoon.  On his honeymoon.  She did on his honeymoon.  How did that marriage go?  She didn't know.  She was passed out.  Yeah, it lasted, like, three years.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  That's bad.  I mean...  Why would you get married at that point? 
[01:51:00]  You can just do that.  You can just do that.  What's that?  He didn't even have a dick.  He used to take it out all the time, and we were like, that's not even a dick.  Yeah.  He's not funny.  He doesn't have a dick.  He really doesn't.  Right?  This guy sounds like a blast, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like...  You're not even cheating with a dick, that's true.  Unbelievable.  It's really not.  Well, it's been an honor to talk to you. 
[01:51:30]  Yes, Bob Levy.  Fucking great, man.  Love the stories.  Where can we find you?  I know your podcast, and I know you're doing the Twitter thing.  What do we got today?  Yeah.

Let's at least give him top three.  Nobody can touch this guy.  Damn it.  Nobody.  Phenomenal.  The way he would work a crowd and just fucking filthy, and old people love him.  Says the grossest things on stage, but they love him. 
[01:52:30]  I call him, Jim, I'm a charming rapist.  Yeah.  That's what I am.  Is that on the poster?  Yeah.  Is that on the bill?  Is that the slow line?  I mean, he opens his show, he's like, how many guys do you like coming on girls' faces?  And he put, you know, like, who's not going to raise their hand?  But that's like a tough line to follow.  But that's his opening joke.  You've got to do 45 after that.  Yeah, that's something I go, all right, if I'm doing 45 minutes, I'm going to put that  at minute 42 to make sure I got everybody on my side, especially the girls.  He opens up with how many guys like coming on girls' faces. 
[01:53:00]  Girls, let them come on your face.  Sir, do you come on your wife's face?  How come?  What, are you a prude?  You put all of the shit on your face, why can't a little cum go, and right, that's  his opening bit, and they love him.  It's not degrading them.  They get a coach bag out of it.  Jesus fucking Christ.  My wife's got 50 in them.  They're all stuck together in one room.  All right, guys, I love you, and I hope to see you soon.  I'll be coming more to the city more. 
[01:53:30]  All right, Bob.  Cool, Bob.  Take it easy.  You got to come in to see us.  All right, man.  Bob Levy.  I'll try.  I don't even know what that's about.  Is he banned from the building or something?  I don't know what the fuck is going on.  Really?  Yeah, it's craziness.  I love those stories.  Fucking just road stories.  You guys are just debauchers on the road.  Yeah, I mean, you know, that was early 90s when we started.  But, you know, it's like, and you look back, we wasted a lot of time and not focus on our  careers by doing that shit.  Yeah, you got to live, too, right? 
[01:54:00]  I know, but you know what, it's, we always, we always would yell at the guy, I'm going  back to the hotel, all right?  We're like, well, for what?  Right.  For what?  For what?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Come on.  We're going to go out.  You're like, nah, I got to write some jokes.  I'm going to go listen to my set.  I tape record.  We're the Lone Warriors, damn it.

We highlight the best moments from this week's Opie and Anthony shows.  Here on the worst of the week countdown with me, Sam Roberts, from Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony Live,  as well as the Sam Roberts show, which airs on this channel, the Opie and Anthony channel, 4 p.m. Eastern on Sunday.  Still to come on this countdown, Opie and Anthony's big interview with Courtney Love. 
[01:59:30]  Maria Menounos, however, was also in studio.  She's on Extra.  I guess she's a producer or something on a new movie that's out now.  It's on iTunes.  You can download it and everything.  It's always interesting when we get people in studio who are on these entertainment shows like Extra,  because we never know if they're going to be a cool person that you can talk to  or just the shell of a human being that presents no opinion about anything.  Maria Menounos turned out to be an actual human being. 
[02:00:00]  Always a treat.  Plus, she's super hot.  Maria Menounos, on the countdown.  Number two.  Number two.  Maria!  Wow.  Goddamn.  Hi there.  How are you?  How are you?  How you doing?  Wonderful.  Are you going to grab a seat?  Wow.  Right over there.  This is like the party room.  Does it smell like farts in here?  We need to know.  It's terrible.  Because we hate when pretty girls come in here and it smells like farts.  It smells all right, huh?  I told you.  No, it doesn't. 
[02:00:30]  Jimmy's been sneaking some out.  He's not admitting it officially yet.  You just put a little dryer sheet in your underwear and then it would smell pretty.  There you go.  And you can let loose and not be afraid.  Yeah, all right.  Dryer sheet in your underwear?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  That's a little trick.  My brother used to do that and I realized, I go, wow, I should create underwear for men  with little sleeves and you can put a dryer sheet in there.  A little pocket.  They have them with charcoal.  You can put charcoal in them.  Yeah, for people who have issues.  They have underwear with a charcoal thing.  Really?  It filters it through.  Yeah.  Are you serious? 
[02:01:00]  Absolutely.  I have a hat made of it.  Oh, you saw the Saragusa commercial, right?  You seen the Saragusa commercial, Tony Saragusa?  Oh, that's so embarrassing, the poor guy.  Tony Saragusa.  Some guys, you know.  Leak.  Leak.  So, he's talking about how manly it is.  I thought, wasn't he on TV?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a national commercial.  How much money do you need to make?  Where would you draw?  Have you ever done a commercial?  Yeah.  Okay, now, do you draw the line?  Yes.  What's the most?  Yes. 
[02:01:30]  I got something recently for some...  Massengill?  Like, something like that.  I can't remember what it was right now.  Adult diapers, right?  And I was like, no, I can't do that.  Sorry.  The adult diaper commercial, where they say, oh, she doesn't really need them.  Lisa Renna.  Yeah, well, they're doing it with a few.  She don't hire it with diapers.  No way.  Yeah.  She does, like, Depends commercials?  Yes, but they go, like...  You're on TV and you don't know this stuff?  No, I don't get to watch TV.  You're too busy doing it.  She's wearing one right now.  And they go, she doesn't need to, but...  Because they want to show how people that aren't ancient kind of look, just in case you have a problem. 
[02:02:00]  So, they show people, you know, that kind of look good with a dress on, a clingy dress, wearing a diaper.  The new ones with the Dance with the Stars.  Yeah, yeah.  No way.  Who?  I don't know.  I don't watch that show, Maria.  Jesus.  Cheryl Burke's wearing a diaper?  Cheryl Burke.  Oh, it was her?  I know her.  She's wearing a diaper.  Yeah.  But they say she doesn't need it, but look how she can move with this thing on.  Well, if you don't need it, why would you?  Like, what would make you go, I'd love to have that?  Just in case.  Because if someone's watching and they're only seeing all people... 
[02:02:30]  That is so funny.  She doesn't have the problem.  Yeah.  But if she did, she could dance like this and there wouldn't be an issue.  Well, you guys don't understand, when they started that campaign, they didn't use that tagline.  No.  So, everyone was like, what the fuck does...  Who was the first...  Lisa Renner, yeah.  Lisa Renner really need this?  And then they finally had to put the little disclosure in there that she actually doesn't  need it.  What's his name?  Her husband.  Lisa Renner's...  Oh, Harry Hamlin, yeah.  Harry Hamlin.  They had Harry Hamlin there going, doesn't she look great?  Ugh, no.  And, like, they're zooming in on where the diaper would be under her dress. 
[02:03:00]  It was just freakish.  That's still a nice ass, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  It's still shapely.  It's a little more paddy, but...  I might have to compromise.  If the number was big enough...  That's right.  Yeah.  ...to support, so you never know.  No.  Well, think about it.  Like, at some point, you can sit here and say all you want, that I would never do that,  blah, blah, blah, but...  You realize how smart that is that you just did that, so they can never pull the audio?  Yeah.  It'll be like you saying that.  She's not sincere about the product.  That's not why I did, but yeah. 
[02:03:30]  No, no, no.  I'm not saying it's late.  She's got to worry about that stuff.  Very smart.  It's true, though.  When you have kids to support, things change in your mind a little bit, so...  I guess.  Hey.  No, I always said that, like, I would never...  There's a few things...  I was just like, you know, I'll never do, I'll never do, and now I'm getting older,  I'm getting tired.  Yeah.  I'm just like, ah, fuck it.  Yeah.  Nothing is worse than hearing fucking Joe Theismann crying about his prostate and having to piss at every  event he's at.  Yeah, why would he do that?  Oh, it's terrible.  I know.  Hey, you know, my prostate's giving me, oh, a world of hurt. 
[02:04:00]  I used to have to make sure the bathroom was real close.  I was like, Joe, just go sign a couple more footballers.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Joe Theismann signed football?  Come on.  Why would you do that?  So, sorry.  He loves it.  Yeah, we went off on a tangent.  Off topic.  Off topic.  That's okay.  Yeah.  I, uh...  Yeah.  What is your movie about?  Oh.  Adventures of Cereal Buddies.  Different tangent.  It's called The Adventures of Cereal Buddies.  See, I know.  And it's, uh, about these two nitwits on a road trip who are killing people for different 
[02:04:30]  reasons.  They find out they're not on the same page by the end of the trip.  Oh.  And, uh, it was best described as Dumb and Dumber meets Dexter.  Oh.  I think I like this.  But they don't do that thing where they only kill the bad people.  Uh...  Like, on Dexter.  That's why I had to leave, because it was like the serial killer with the heart of gold.  That's what Jimmy said, too.  Well, one of them kills people because he feels like he's giving them safe passage, that they  are evildoers. 
[02:05:00]  Um, and then the other one is killing them because they precipitate...  Well, the other one kills because he's a trophy maker and he doesn't have enough shelf  space.  So he's kind of targeting athletes.  Multi-sport athletes.  It's a little messed up.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  No, I kind of got lost.  I got lost in the...  He makes trophies.  Yeah, he's a trophy.  He works in a trophy shop.  Oh, literally.  We actually use a location. 
[02:05:30]  I used to work at a trophy shop.  So he's killing athletes so he doesn't have to make as many trophies?  Yeah, because he doesn't have enough shelf space.  Oh.  He's a little messed up.  Wow.  I see now.  It's twisted.  I like that.  Yeah, it's a little twisted.  Yeah, it sounds twisted.  Why doesn't he just get a bigger place?  It's pretty big already.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, he's...  You know, when you hear the story, his partner, you know, um...  Killed himself, uh, before because, you know, he had too much going on and so he doesn't  want to end up like him.  Uh-huh.  And who do you play? 
[02:06:00]  I play, uh, one of the sorority girls.  Ooh.  Alongside Beth Bares from Two Broke Girls and we happen to encounter them along the way.  So, and Kathy Lee Gifford's our den mother.  Are you in danger?  No.  Oh.  No.  I'm annoyed by them because they are doing...  You guys obviously saw Animal House, right?  Uh-huh.  Okay, you know, the Animal House plan when they come in and they find the dead sorority  sister and they pretend to, um...  What is it? 
[02:06:30]  They...  I can't even remember the scene.  Yeah, they make believe, uh...  Yeah, they pretend...  The one dude was the boyfriend.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That scene.  So they do this in the movie to us.  Remember?  They go to the sorority house.  And I don't buy it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Dead.  What?  Dead sorority.  A dead sorority sister in Animal House?  I don't remember that part either.  No.  I'm sorry.  They looked it up in the paper and they found out the sorority girl was dead.  So they went there and made believe it was the boyfriend and he didn't know.  So they come in and they do this to us.  And I'm like...  Fawn Liebowitz.  Yeah, I'm like, Fawn Liebowitz, really?  Kill an accident. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  So Beth plays like the dopey sorority sister and I'm the smart one that kind of has like  their number.  And Christopher Lloyd's in it.  Chris McDonald.  Henry Winkler does the narration.  It's a pretty fun movie.  Did you get to meet him?  The Fawns.  Yeah, he's amazing.  We went to Emerson together.  So we've...  I went to Emerson.  You did?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I was on the computer.  There you go.  I know.  A little fist bump there.  What year?  A little fist bump there.  I should have graduated in 2000, but I never finished.  Oh, yeah.  You're a youngster. 
[02:07:30]  I was...  What was I?  93?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  93.  Oh.  And I was 25 by then.  Oh.  I transferred there.  I was a 22-year-old freshman.  Oh, really?  Playling.  Convicted drunk driver.  My whole life was just...  It was over.  But you got to Emerson.  No, no.  Emerson turned it all around.  That's a great school.  Then I started...  Yeah, that's how I...  And look at you now.  Huh?  Yeah, look at me.  It all worked out.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  She's becoming like my life coach now.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  There you go.  Another Emerson grad.  Good deal.  That's pretty cool.  I just went up there for the Evie Awards.  You know, the things that they have up there.  It was good.  Good time.  Good time.  Did you feel kind of like out of place being a freshman as a...  No, when I took like the core requirement classes, there's such a big difference between  an 18-year-old and a 22-year-old.  I felt like I was with children.  I was literally embarrassed.  It's like...  Wow.  When I got there in like January of 91, and I did three years of college by December  of 92, and then I walked in 93.  I went straight through summer, all of that. 
[02:08:30]  I started doing...  Oh, yeah.  My college career was ridiculous.  I didn't go to any parties, nothing.  I was unloading trucks.  I was a loser.  I had fun before.  Yeah, no, I did.  I hung up.  You had all your fun before, which is good.  Then you go to Emerson, you pay a shitload of money, and you get it all done fast.  That's right.  Nice.  That was basically...  That's basically what it is.  I don't know anybody.  Like, I would never go to a reunion.  I don't know anybody's name.  Oh, God.  We never knew this about Bill. 
[02:09:00]  What was your degree in?  Communications, probably.  Yeah, mass communication.  And then I did radio because I was so introverted, and I wanted to be a comedian, but I was afraid  to go on the mic.  Afraid of real people.  So I just remember WECB.  Yeah, of course.  Did they have that?  So I was basically broadcasting only to these dorms, and I had the 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. shift,  and I would just, that was Dinosaur Jr. with blah, blah, blah, right?  And I would actually ask for requests at like 4 in the morning.  No, so at one point, I just was like, oh, God. 
[02:09:30]  So many people called in.  Somebody call up.  Just tell me you hate me.  Something in the phone lit up, and I picked it up, and some guy goes, I hate you.  No.  And hung up on me.  Dude, and I was sitting there like, and then I just catastrophized in my head that everyone  in the dorms was listening, and they all thought that I sucked.  Oh, shit.  No, no.  It turned out it was the boyfriend of the girl who was coming in for like the next shift,  and he was just fucking around.  No one else was listening.  And he called me back.  She said to say, I'm sorry, so I'm sorry.  It was the worst.  Wow.  Sorry. 
[02:10:00]  I'm running my mouth.  You're supposed to be promoting a movie here.  What was your degree in?  I studied broadcast journalism and film.  How did that work out for you?  And I got my job before I graduated, so.  What did you say?  I said, how did it work out for you?  It worked out.  Yeah, I think so.  Did you get your job through contacts you made there, or was it, had nothing to do with  school?  It actually, you know what?  When I went to school, I felt like I was kind of missing out on the whole networking  thing, because I never did. 
[02:10:30]  And then, you know, there were all these, you know, people that were like, oh my God, I totally  have a job when we graduate.  My friend's friend's dad works here and works there, and I'm going to be at E, and I'm like,  oh my God.  I would look at my boyfriend, Kevin, and I'm like, did I fuck up?  Right.  Can I say that?  Yeah.  Please do.  Please do.  I'm like, I think I screwed up.  I think that I didn't spend my time, like, networking.  I was so busy, like, studying and working and doing all that stuff and being involved in  things.  And he's like, you'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Well, the film that I worked in while I was in college, one of the guys was a PA at Channel 
[02:11:00]  One.  And he called me, and he was friends with my boyfriend.  He's like, they're looking for TV anchors.  That's how it works.  And so I got the call, but he was a PA.  It's not like he had any power.  He just told me about it.  So luckily, I worked on the right project, met a person that had, you know, the right  knowledge, and it kind of happened from there.  I don't think anyone actually goes through all the schooling, goes through, like, sending  out the resumes or going on auditions, whatever it is, and gets a job. 
[02:11:30]  It's always like some freak meeting or some weird networking thing or nepotism.  Um, but it's never just, but if I didn't go to Emerson, it would have never happened  because if I didn't go to Emerson, say I'd gone to BU, for example, like I wanted to originally  for broadcast journalism.  I got in, but Emerson gave me more money.  So I had to go where I was.  BU is way more expensive, isn't it?  Yeah.  And so I wouldn't have had the option to do film.  Well, I ended up meeting Kevin, who came back to Boston to make his movie, and I started 
[02:12:00]  volunteering that summer.  And I was like, oh, I like this film thing.  And I was able to now add that to my major and add those classes in.  Well, had I not worked on that, I would have never gone into those classes and learned  what I learned.  And, you know, it's just, there's a series of things.  Yeah, exactly.  But it's actually true.  You never know.  You never know.  And so I, because I was prepared, I met the opportunity, you know, sometimes the only reason  why I ended up doing standup was because the guy I worked with wanted to do it too. 
[02:12:30]  Shit.  And it stopped being on TV.  Because like, you know, back in the day, remember, it's just like Hollywood was a zillion  miles away.  Yeah.  It wasn't like you could make YouTube, it seemed, videos and shit.  Right, right.  It seemed impossible.  Impossible.  So he was just like, you know what?  He goes, these guys aren't funny.  One of these nights I'm going to take a shot at Jack Daniels and I'm going on stage.  Then all of a sudden I'm just like, is this guy?  You can just do it?  Where is that guy?  I don't know.  I lost touch with him.  Oh, no.  I was really hoping you guys would have won.  Sorry.  They always go with the thing. 
[02:13:00]  Why couldn't it just be positive or up with the thing?  It's just like, what have I had on that guy?  Because we know what happened to that guy.  What's he selling for?  We already know what happened to that guy.  He killed himself.  He probably met the love of his life and he's got a great job and he's not in this horrific  business.  Perfect.  You know?  He's pretty happy.  Yeah.  Didn't have to do standup on a boat during a prom.  Got a death.  Got a death, nice big death note on his house.  We've been, we started shooting our reality show the last two weeks and I said to them, 
[02:13:30]  I go, you know, I have all this crazy footage of me when I was younger saying all this crazy  stuff.  Like someday I'm going to go to Hollywood.  Someday I'm going to do this.  Someday I'm going to do that.  I go, I think there's something you can do with this.  I mean, I'm definitely not a writer, but I feel like having someone kind of predict the  future on camera when they're 18 or whatever is kind of interesting.  And so there's one, um, interview I was doing, I was, uh, being interviewed for like Miss  Massachusetts, Teen USA or something. 
[02:14:00]  And, uh, they said, you know, I got interviewed for that too.  Yeah.  They said, you know, they asked me something.  I was like, you know, I always thought, and this is my deep Boston accent, you know, Hollywood  was like so far away and unattainable.  But I'm here to say that, you know, dreams do come true.  And I know someday that I'm going to make it.  It's if I work hard, like all this stuff I'm saying, and I'm like, and my hair is in a  bun.  I'm 40 pounds heavier.  I'm this like little kid and I'm saying all this stuff.  And I'm like, that's freaking crazy. 
[02:14:30]  Like it happened.  Everything I said is crazy.  You're from Massachusetts.  How did you get rid of that accent?  It went away the first day I went on camera.  Come on.  Crazy.  And then it would fall back.  So I would go on camera and I'd feel like I have to be professional.  And then the second the camera would be off, I would be like potty in and talking like  this again.  And, you know, and then my producers would get nervous when I got to LA and, you know,  cause that was on camera at Emerson on like our school news.  But then when I went to channel one, every so often I would slip back and you're like, 
[02:15:00]  you're not going to do it.  Are you?  And I'm like, no, no, I'm fine.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  And then it just stays.  What was that horrific class you had to take?  You know, that was like voice and articulation.  Oh my God.  It was the worst.  What was this?  Voice and articulation.  And you'd go up, they'd try to teach you, was it career speech?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  It's just, what is the hell is this in my brain?  Career speech.  It's like basically, you know, the news would like her, like you can't tell where she's  from.  Not at all.  Yeah.  That's the goal.  So she obviously passed the class.  I never did.  I mean, I did, but I just remember the first day they just have you read from a book. 
[02:15:30]  Wow.  So, you know, really?  And then they try to get you.  Hey, you have to read out loud.  Yeah.  And I remember there was this kid drove me nuts.  He had vocal fry was what it's called.  It's when you don't push enough air through your voice box.  And he would, he would, he would talk like this.  And then, and then they would just be like, you got to push more air out.  And he would just continue to talk like that, but louder for our scar.  And seven years ago, every time he went up there, like I literally, I wanted to murder 
[02:16:00]  this kid.  I still remember him.  I still remember him.  I still remember this.  Pudgy kid.  Right.  You're not scarred by any kids in class?  No, man.  None that I can think of right now.  Dally doly with the big head.  Oh, yeah.  We all had those.  For me.  They were doing something called, was it mainstreaming?  Or something.  It was some experimental thing where they put mentally and physically challenged kids  in the same classes as the normal kids.  Yeah.  Who are at the meanest point in their life. 
[02:16:30]  Right.  You know what I'm going to understand?  Smart enough to come up with the insult, but not mature enough to be like, I shouldn't  do that.  Oh, that's good.  Right.  That's a good program.  Right.  But I wasn't a mean kid or anything, but I was like traumatized by some of these kids.  Because, I mean, I'm talking, you know, it was a while back, so like thalidomide babies  were in my class with little flipper arms and a giant head and fucking.  What is it?  It's like thalidomide.  They used to give it to women that were kind of apt to miscarriage and they would give them 
[02:17:00]  this drug, thalidomide.  And I thought I was crazy for not knowing.  I was like trying to figure it out.  I'm like, did I hear it wrong?  Oh, no.  He's got it.  It fucked kids up.  It gave them birth defects where they had the little flipper arms.  Well, they'd have big, giant water on the brain heads.  And one kid had this eye.  It was like a goat's eye.  The pupil was like straight across.  And I was like eating lunch.  You had multiple kids in your class with this? 
[02:17:30]  Yes.  It was crazy.  It was like I grew up in Chernobyl.  I just fucking.  We're older than you.  They've cured a lot of this shit.  Oh, yeah.  It's crazy.  The prenatal screening process these days is amazing.  They could tell people very early on genetically what's going to happen to the kids.  And then they do, you know, amnio tests and could tell this, that.  Back then it was just, you know, Papa would be there with a cigar ready to light it, rolling  to die, going, hey, hey.  Hoping for the best.  Oh, you crapped out, Dad. 
[02:18:00]  Look at that.  Peg way.  Get a fucking spike.  You do know what show you're on, right?  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it was terrible.  I know.  And then as kids.  And you asked, by the way.  There were a lot of.  Marie asked.  Weird handicaps back then.  You asked.  I asked.  Well, yeah.  You asked about the weird kids.  But it traumatized me.  He scraped the cheese off his pizza, and he hated when you'd blow air in his face.  Like, we would all go up to him and go, and he would go, stop bothering me, and scratch  his face.  God. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, he was great.  And so you kept doing it.  Oh, that's all we did.  There was this kid named Patrick Fullan, and he was.  Patrick Fullan was like a chubby kid.  Yeah, because she's a good person.  You can tell.  She should be horrified.  He made faces when he punched him in the stomach.  I don't know why you would want to go blow in the kid's face after he's, like, freaking  out.  The sad part, we think this is hilarious.  But that's my kids are terrible.  Yeah, we were young.  I mean, we were young and stupid.  If I blow in your face, would you pass me water?  Yes.  Thank you.  It was awful.  We used to punch a kid in the stomach because he made a funny face when you did it.  It was this Patrick Fullan, this little pudgy kid. 
[02:19:00]  And a little gang would get him against the wall.  No!  And he'd sit there.  And then he'd punch him in the stomach.  And he'd go, like, oh, whoop.  Like, he made a funny face.  So every day, all day long, they would punch Patrick Fullan in the stomach just to see the face.  It's terrible.  Of course it is.  But this was before they invented the word bullying.  But it wasn't bullying.  It was, you know.  The word was.  Oh, please.  They used to take me. 
[02:19:30]  I was one of two Greeks in the school.  Uh-oh.  Good night.  Hold on.  And me and this kid, Dino, and they used to smush us together in the school yard.  And they're like, you're Greeks.  You need to stick together and get married and kiss.  And I'm like, I'm like, 10.  Like, what are you doing?  Or nine.  Whatever.  And they would, like, smush us.  And they would, like, not talk to us.  And he'd be so mean.  Put them up to it.  No.  Could you smush us together?  This is the hot one over there.  Bully.  Here's my lunch money.  So mean.  Smush me into her.  Maybe not only the Greek geek.  We tied this kid to a tree.  See?  See?  And we've been throwing fireworks at him. 
[02:20:00]  So my brother took the firecracker and had one of those short wicks.  And we had to light him.  We were just doing it close to him.  He was freaking out.  And it was just fun.  Yeah.  It was fun.  It was terrible.  And he lit the thing.  And he went back to, like, throw it like a football that blew up in his hand.  I remember that.  Did it fuck his hand up?  I remember he was just, you know, you just poured water on everything when you were younger.  Yeah, yeah.  So you just poured water.  Rubbing leaves.  Yeah, yeah.  And he was the end of being there.  We used to go in the woods with foam rubber from a couch and light it on fire and hold it up. 
[02:20:30]  And it would go, voot, voot, voot.  It would make, like, the sound when it would, it was, like, bubbling, burning rubber falling.  And when it was on fire, it would sound like, voot, voot, voot.  And it was cool.  Until it hit me in the wrist.  One thing, a blob of it hit me on the wrist.  I ran out of the woods like that fucking girl in Vietnam, the picture.  With your fucking napalm.  I was screaming. 
[02:21:00]  Game over.  Scream.  Game over.  Oh, did that hurt?  I like high-pitched scream, crying.  My friends are just like, and then when it finally stopped hurting, I'm like, oh, that'll  never go away.  Now I have to move.  I have to go back.  They're going to remember my fucking pussy baby crying as you're running out of the woods.  Why did they boo you when you inducted Bob Backlund?  Oh, man.  You're a big wrestling fan, right?  Yeah.  You know.  To set this up properly, you're a big wrestling fan and you inducted Bob Backlund into the 
[02:21:30]  Hall of Fame.  And that's Jimmy's favorite wrestler.  Is it really?  Oh, yeah.  Well, here's the thing.  I realized when they made the announcement, people were starting to send me hate tweets.  Why are you inducting Bob Backlund?  And I'm like, so then I finally was like, okay, I need to let people know that we've  been friends for a long time.  So I tweeted some stuff and then people were like, oh, okay, that kind of makes sense.  And I figured when they heard the speech, they would realize how close we've been all  these years.  And so a little bit is my fault because I let the speech go on too long. 
[02:22:00]  I think I wrote too long.  How long was it?  I don't remember.  Wait, wait, wait.  I got to stop you, though.  How did you become friends with Bob Backlund?  That seems like a weird combination.  I know.  Well, when I was making my first film with Kevin, Kevin had brought Backlund to MTV and  put him on Singled Out back in the day.  And so he had maintained a relationship with him.  We cast him in our movie and he came and shot it.  And of course, I met him there and became friends with him.  And he came to my pageant when I was in Miss Mass and things like that. 
[02:22:30]  So we've helped him run for Congress.  We helped him with his run.  We've been friends for years.  Okay.  So now fast forward.  You got the intro.  So fast forward, they called me up and they said, Mr. Backlund would like you to induct  him.  And I was hoping that that would be the case because secretly I wanted to because I feel  like, you know, there's a lot of people that could have done it.  But would they have given him the props that he really deserved for what he did? 
[02:23:00]  Like, I get misty eyed.  And so I don't know if they would.  Like, you have to really know him and really have, like, you know, whatever.  The fans probably wanted, like, another, like, Tony Gurria or Bruno Samartino to do it.  They wanted, like, the Iron Sheik.  They wanted so many people.  Like, who would you have wanted being a Backlund fan?  Probably would have been Sergeant Slaughter.  Slaughter.  That was another one.  Yeah.  Somebody really unpleasant.  And so, and the thing is, is he asked for me.  And so I'm not going to say no, obviously. 
[02:23:30]  And I was excited to do it.  And so I worked really, really hard to make sure, like, you know, the speech is perfect.  Kevin helped me with it.  And I think it just went a little too long.  The crowd gets a little restless, gets a little tired, especially if it's somebody they didn't  really get why you were there.  But it actually turned around because people were really mad that I got booed.  And so the fans were mad at the fans inside that were booing.  And so they kept saying, like, that they were really embarrassed by them.  So when you got booed, did you keep going? 
[02:24:00]  Did you plough?  There you go.  I did.  See that?  Yeah.  Emerson.  So you have to.  You learned that at Emerson?  We learned that at Emerson.  Bill had a moment once.  Yeah, we did.  Yeah, that's right.  Bill had a moment a few years back.  The ones that got mad at you or mad at them for booing, I call them, on Twitter, I call  them white knights.  White knights.  They're the guys that, now, let's say you tweeted something and somebody tweeted, retweeted  you and said something nasty about you.  Guys will fly in bashing the guy that bashed you on this odd chance that you're going to 
[02:24:30]  fucking, like, oh, thank you.  Oh, and some relationship's going to spark.  They're Twitter white knights and they're the biggest fucking losers.  The worst.  Phony.  I can't stand them.  She's like a sister to me.  I like throwing a good bashing around, regardless of, you know, guy, girl, or whatever the fuck  it is.  And when I do, I don't need some fucking guy thinking his dream is going to come true  and she's going to knock on your door and thank you for saving her from this Twitter  villain. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  And so I call them out.  I stick them on them sometimes.  I call for the white knights.  I'm like, hey, look at what this guy just said.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Believe me, we've done that, too, on Twitter.  Sure.  Tech, if someone really bugs me and I have enough time on my hands on Twitter.  Oh, I go at them.  I will fucking do such research.  I mean, sit there and paw into Google.  Oh, really?  And put his name in and try to find an email and find, like, his stash of pictures on fucking  photo sites. 
[02:25:30]  You can find all that?  Oh, yeah.  If you have to.  And all you got to do is find a picture of us.  You go to his, like, Kodak photo share?  Yes.  And, like, you'll fucking see, like, his wife and stuff.  And I'll be like, oh, nice fucking pig wife you got there.  Oh, yeah.  I'll be fucking brutal.  Ruthless.  Your kid's cross-eyed.  Hey, your kid's cross-eyed.  Why don't you fix that lazy eye?  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  That's the way to handle it, though, because you could always just block them.  I've had more people.  I've had more people cancel their fucking Twitter accounts after giving me shit.  No.  No shit. 
[02:26:00]  I have a fucking great record of people just...  And the fans are hysterical, like, well, there's another one down.  And they just cancel.  They fucking leave Twitter.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it's great.  Fuck them.  I don't think she wants to hear this.  Nah.  No, I don't know.  It has nothing to do with her movie.  It's a difference of attack.  I will go at them and say, like, really, what in your day made you so angry that you felt  like, lashing out at me was going to make it better.  Stupid!  Now, how do you respond to that?  And then they're like, ugh.  And most of the time, they don't know what to say back. 
[02:26:30]  Sometimes people are like, you know what?  And they actually will be honest.  They'll be like, I had a bad day.  I'm really sorry.  And I took it out on you.  And I'm like, no problem.  Well, for a pretty girl, maybe they'll do that.  Oh, good.  But sometimes...  You big, dumb redhead, you fuck.  That's what I get.  I just saw the butt thing.  That's so funny.  You prick.  But some guy smacked Beyonce in the butt.  Here's the thing, though.  During a concert.  I have everything out there.  What?  Oh, yeah.  That's so...  Because what the fuck?  You know?  He snacked her in the butt.  That's hilarious, though.  Who does that? 
[02:27:00]  I know.  No, but you know something?  If you're walking around with your fucking...  I don't know.  I'm just saying.  I'm not going to come off like a moron.  I don't agree with touching anybody.  You can't.  If you're really showing off your butt, you should expect a slap, right?  No, no.  No, that's what Bill's saying.  I'm saying if your whole fucking thing is, you know, you're advertising your new album where  you're singing and you're on, you know, you're laying on your stomach, putting your butt  in the fucking air.  It's like, come on.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:27:30]  I'm not saying it's right.  Right.  I'm saying what...  But you shouldn't be surprised.  It's like walking through Central Park at three in the morning, dressed like Liberace singing  I'm in the money.  Now, you shouldn't get fucking mugged, but after a while, it's like, what are you doing?  That's right.  You go on a date with her.  She's got a skirt on.  Hey, what the fuck does she have to say now?  You know, fucking...  You know, when you go to a strip joint, do you just go up and grab the woman up on stage  just because she's stripping?  You can't do that.  No, no, no.  You can't do that.  There are rules.  No, no.  You guys are confusing me advocating what that guy did. 
[02:28:00]  It's just like, you can't fucking walk down a goddamn runway where there's people that  fucking close.  You're giving people too much credit is what you're doing.  They're animals.  Bill is being realistic here.  They're animals.  Yeah.  They're animals.  He's not saying it's right.  I'm not saying it's right on any fucking level.  He really isn't saying it's right.  But it's just like, whoever the fucking moron was that goes, here's a good idea.  Get closer to these fucking people.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure nothing bad will happen.  I mean, God, people, they're animals.  Yeah.  I'm just going to grab. 
[02:28:30]  It's terrible.  I had a guy who was in France.  I was at the Cannes Film Festival and I was like on a power walk with my friend and this  guy's coming at us on his bicycle and he literally reaches out, grabs my boobs and  keeps biking.  I'm like, what the hell just happened?  And so I started chasing after him.  I was so mad, but I couldn't do that.  I would kill.  Could you imagine?  Just think of this guy laying in bed going, ah, God, I just want to grab the boobs. 
[02:29:00]  Right.  I don't want to get caught and just rollerblading.  On his fucking bike.  No, no, no.  It's so wrong, but it's supposed to be a rollerblading.  I did that once.  You just brought back a memory.  What do you mean you did that once?  I quit somebody once.  No, no.  I was a teenager and I was with my friends and we saw some pretty girl and they dared me  to walk up and just grab her ass.  Oh, my God.  So I did.  And I'm like, I haven't thought of this in over 20 years.  And I grabbed her ass and she's like, how'd you like a punch in the face, asshole?  Oh.  I was so surprised.  That was your answer.  No, I don't want to. 
[02:29:30]  So where did this guy, he got, and he got away with it?  Yeah.  He just kept biking?  He literally was riding on his bike.  You probably shouldn't say this.  He's like me, he's riding on his bike, grabs like this.  Oh, wow.  Hard, too.  Wow.  I'm actually jealous Bill got to be the example, Greg.  Oh, it's fucking, I mean, I know it's traumatic, but that's, it's just something that's so fucking  pathetic.  It's funny.  But you know what's awful is like you always, first of all, women are just violated so frequently,  or at least I have been, that you're just like, you just are continuously in fucking  shock, shock, shoot. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, right.  You're continuously in shock.  Like, and so these people, please tell me that has to be the most fucked up one.  I was at an invited event recently.  This guy in a unicycle comes by.  And I'm talking to somebody about a project, whatever, a movie, and he's like, you know,  you'd be really good in this.  And he's caressing my heart.  Oh, my God.  And you're like, this isn't happening.  No, no, no, this isn't happening.  I'm at a, at a kid's event.  The wife of the person is standing right there.  Wow. 
[02:30:30]  She's not seeing this.  So I kind of just turned, I'm like, maybe he was just, you know, just rubbing my back  and he didn't.  Yeah, maybe.  Because the back feels like an asshole.  Did it again.  Did it again.  And I'm like, this is not happening right now.  Did you say anything to him?  Isn't it weird how like.  Wait, I'm talking off mic.  I apologize.  No, we heard.  Maybe the listeners had their ears to the.  Yeah.  No, we full on knew what he was doing.  No, no, but did you say to him, did you say to him like, hey, what do you think you're  doing?  No, because you're in shock and you realize it after you're like, oh my God, wait.  Oh, he really was just creepy. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Being creepy.  And like, you just, you keep making excuses for people at some point.  And you always think you're going to be that girl that like at some point you're just like,  I'm going to knock you out.  I'm going to have chain reaction and knock you out.  But you're just in shock.  And we're all like, we're all, and we're all not good career wise.  Yes.  Like, I think you enjoyed it.  I love one of these days.  I just would love.  Yeah.  To unload.  To unload.  Oh, God.  Someone's going to get the wrath.  We hate him and secretly admire him at the same time.  Oh, my goodness.  That's a nice rub. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Right there.  I used to work with a guy who was like touchy feely like that.  And he just, he would come up, you'd be standing there like you wouldn't see him.  He just had this way of approaching where you just, you just didn't see him in your peripheral.  He would sidle up on you?  Hey, how you doing?  He'd come and he'd rub your belly real quick and give it a pat.  It's your belly?  It was so fucking creepy.  The worst one ever was I was at the vending machine and he did this thing where he came  up to me from behind.  He slapped me on the back on one side of my shoulder, slid his hand all the way across 
[02:32:00]  my back, all the way across my back, and then he squeezed my other fucking shoulder.  What the fuck is that?  Like he was trying to see if a melon was ripe.  Dude, I swear to God, it took like fucking three hours to get that.  To get it to go back down.  Jesus.  Imagine it being your butt or your boobs.  Yeah, right?  I mean, come on.  Wow, that's it.  So he slaps, rose a little.  He went, hey, and he slapped my back and slid his hand, like, it felt like it took an hour.  But it was so quick, though. 
[02:32:30]  And then he squeezed my other fucking shoulder and I was just like.  What is that?  That's intrusive.  You took your ear and this was like, oh, yeah.  And that's the thing, though.  I was so fucking young, I didn't know how to react to anything with just pure rage.  So it's just like, well, I want to take his head now and stick it through the fucking vending machine, but I'll lose my job.  I can't.  Right.  So then I didn't say anything.  So then you felt like you would hoard yourself out.  So then I just gave him like dirty looks.  And then it came time for my fucking raise.  And it's just Bill's very unsocial.  It's like, oh, please. 
[02:33:00]  You hoard yourself for your job.  You let yourself.  Sometimes you just have to bite your tongue.  Oh, it's terrible.  Yeah, we've got to wrap up with Maria.  Thanks for having me on, guys.  Thanks for coming by, Maria.  Anytime.  The Worst of the Week countdown continues.  Worst of the Week countdown.  We've been highlighting the best moments that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm Sam Roberts from the Opie and Anthony Show.  And after Opie and Anthony Live, and you've made it to number one, this thing will be replaying all weekend. 
[02:33:30]  So if you missed any of it, tune in for it.  I also think they put it on demand.  So that's good.  Number one this week, Courtney Love.  Rock icon to me.  I think at this point you could call Courtney Love a rock icon.  Opie and Anthony did not know what was going to happen when she came in studio.  They were actually thinking they may have to expect the worst.  They were thinking this could go horribly wrong.  However, it went horribly right.  There's videos from it on the SiriusXM YouTube page.  I think you can get to them by going to SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[02:34:00]  Courtney Love on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Number one.  Courtney Love.  Hi.  How are you, Courtney?  How are you?  How are you?  Good.  What's going on?  Take a seat.  Coming from Stern.  Have a seat.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  What happened?  Jim Brewer was...  He was like, has she left yet?  Because I have a story.  Uh-oh.  And he's on SNL and he told this story.  It was total bullshit.  So I went back in there and clarified it. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, Jim Brewer, right?  Yeah, Brewer.  Yeah.  Yeah, we know him pretty well.  He was telling an SNL story that just wasn't true.  Really?  Yeah, people always have this sort of like,  Courtney stole my grandmother's wedding ring and then menstruated on my TC sheets and  then she burned the building down kind of thing.  So, and then she punched my grandma.  People will usually err to the side of, you probably did something outrageous though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, even Howard was, I mean, this picture goes, see, you're not wearing underwear. 
[02:35:00]  I'm like, that is a thin strip of cotton.  Oh.  There's a difference.  There was a little sneak shot that was taken?  No, it was a stage diving those days.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So you covered up the goods with something.  I always covered up the goods.  You covered up the goods.  I don't want error down there.  Were you, you must have been caught though.  Aren't you supposed to air it out though?  What?  Aren't you supposed to air it out?  Well, when you're in the bath and shit, yeah.  But I figure being constant wearing like.  I mean, my move, I only have one rock move is up, my foot up on the monitor.  So, you know, you can sort of see up and thicker, the line of cotton is the more safe, I feel. 
[02:35:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get it.  Certainly waxed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't want any pubes sticking out of it.  Wires.  Unruly.  Yeah.  Unruly.  Like the black clothes.  There is a band that was called L7.  They're awesome.  Sure.  And I got, this is like coming to the collective and now it's me, but I didn't do it.  I didn't think of this.  This girl named Danita Sparks.  I grew up with her, actually her bass player Jennifer Finch, who's my oldest friend, still 
[02:36:00]  has the same phone number.  So, if I'm ever in jail, that is the number I can call.  That's the one you have memorized.  Yeah.  Anyway, Finch and Danita, they were at Reading in England and they were getting bottled and  booed and mud and da-da-da.  And Danita was on a really quite heavy menses and she reaches into her jeans and she just  took this tampon and she threw it into the crowd.  Wow.  And it was, it's a hundred thousand person crowd. 
[02:36:30]  Legendary.  Right?  That's rock and roll right there.  Brilliant.  I wish I had fucking thought of it.  That's rock and roll.  So, this guy comes up to me about, I don't know, two weeks ago and he goes, yeah, I got  hit in the face with your tampon at the plate.  I'm like, I didn't do it, man.  They'll attribute that to you because, yeah.  I mean, I love the accolade, but I didn't think of it.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a big fetish for a lot of guys, too.  It's a really weird one.  That's one I don't get.  It's been hit by Ellie.  No, tampons are a fetish.  She told me she was having a really heavy flow and then she could just see the blood 
[02:37:00]  spurting off of her.  Oh, man.  Yeah, but I mean, if your fucking drummer gets hit in the head with a hard bottle, like,  you know.  You've got to fight with what you've got.  You've got to fight with your little string.  Just take your pearl out there and.  Now, you don't deny that you were pretty wild back in what they called the day, right?  I'm wild in the day, but, you know, there's this great Flaubert quote.  He wrote the book of Madame Bovier. 
[02:37:30]  It is wild in my work, bourgeois in my life.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Does that fit you?  Oh, yeah.  That fits me to a T right now.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  So you've, you've, in your personal life, what, you've kind of mellowed out?  Bourgeois.  Bourgeois.  Grace is living.  Bourgeois.  Grace is living.  But still, when you're on stage and stuff, you're.  Yeah, but I don't stage dive anymore.  No.  Because, I mean, the fingering and everything else.  I was trying to prove a point.  It was like, okay, better could do this. 
[02:38:00]  You know, Kurt could do this.  Cordell could do this.  And they get you like football heroes.  And I kept trying to prove the point.  Yeah.  And I never broke any, my, my limbs never got broken.  Right.  But, uh, my clothes would all be off.  Wow.  Would guys rope you, pulling you, pushing you back up?  Yeah.  I mean, there's pictures that are just very violent and da-da-da.  But I just liked it.  I was like, are you going to rape me?  Are you going to rape me?  Was this some sort of, like, game you play?  I don't know.  So guys, guys actually would finger you as you would crowd surf? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, but I didn't really feel it because I was also fighting off.  My arm's getting broken.  It's getting squeezed.  You got to prioritize the body parts at that point.  You don't feel the finger.  Neck getting twisted.  Right.  So if you're mellow in your personal life, does that make you want to go back to work?  Because you kind of miss that?  Yeah, I'm touring.  I start touring on the 20th.  I can't wait.  Where's the tour start?  Anyway, it's a tertiary market tour, meaning it's, like, small venues, like Stone Pony and 
[02:39:00]  House of Blues, like, things like that.  Right.  And then I'm doing this television show, which shall not be named, that I thought I would  never do TV.  Ever.  Ever.  You know, like, TV's the devil.  I mean, I remember walking around Memphis with Woody Harrelson, like, 14 years ago during  that Larry Flint movie, and unfortunately his name was Woody, the bartender, as well, and  he was, like, walking around with a fucking beetle. 
[02:39:30]  Wow, yeah.  And I had this one girlfriend who became a soap opera star, and I went to a mall with  her, and these ladies were so, they were, like, cattle.  Yeah.  They were very large and in sweat outfits, and she was mobbed.  Yeah, yeah.  All from being on TV.  From being on a soap opera.  Yeah, but you're recognizable.  And they didn't know her name as an actress, and anyway, TV has never been my thing, particularly  what we call reality TV or whatever, and this isn't, like, some E! channel, Courtney's 
[02:40:00]  life thing.  What TV show is it?  I can't tell you.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  Because it's a network thing, so it's a big thing.  Is it something that's already on, or is it brand new?  No, it's already on.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Good to know.  Maybe, like, you know, American Idol.  I can't say.  I just can't say.  A judge or something.  I just can't say.  A judge.  A judge on American Idol.  I just can't say.  I just can't say.  Wow, you're going to be on American Idol.  That's great.  That's a great gig.  I did not say that.  That's a great gig.  Wow.  American Idol.  We got a scoop today. 
[02:40:30]  This show is looking for, I read the demographic thing they're looking for is disaffected.  I love that word.  Oh.  Disaffected females and homosexuals.  Oh.  And therefore, there is only one person to call.  That would be me.  Wait, so what show?  The Voice?  No, I get the cutters.  It's still to be American Idol.  That is true, yeah.  What happened to my mic?  It's on.  It's on.  No, you muted me.  No way.  You're silencing me.  No.  Are you headphones?  You're silencing me.  Where?  You're headphones with your name.  Who's Opie and who's Anthony?  Opie. 
[02:41:00]  Anthony.  Who do you think looks like Anthony out of these two?  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, really.  It's a.  We didn't mute you.  Maybe it's your headphones.  I'm silenced at the lambs.  Maybe your headphone jack is.  I can smell the lambs.  Maybe your headphone jack?  You got cheap perfume.  So American Idol, that's a great gig.  I did not say shit.  Is it either that or the voice?  Yeah.  Okay.  I couldn't get on the voice if you pay.  I mean.  Oh, okay.  Lots of voice.  But she's not saying no to American Idol. 
[02:41:30]  I'm not saying anything.  American Idol.  They're knocking everybody out.  What's the dance show?  Dance with the Stars?  Dance with the Stars.  Because, you know.  Woo!  Whoa.  Because my.  Because I'm sorry.  My pole work gives me so much, you know.  I enjoyed that greatly.  That you just did that.  Capacity.  Did you have the goods covered up?  Very covered up.  All right.  They're covered up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With a thin strip.  With a thin strip.  A very thin strip.  That was a hit.  She's not denying American Idol.  No.  They're getting rid of everybody.  They really are.  That'd be a great gig.  That would be a good one. 
[02:42:00]  They like someone that's outspoken.  A little outrageous.  Yeah.  They like that on the show.  Yeah.  You'd be perfect for that show.  You'd be honest.  Yep.  She's not saying a word.  Ooh.  Rumor has it.  That's how it starts.  Well, it's been too soft because nobody's been honest on that show for a while.  Yeah.  And you need that.  Don't you think like badasses are supposed to go on there and be badasses and then they  go on there and it's butterflies flying at their asses?  It's like, come on.  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  You know, Tyler even, like, he was nice.  They were overly nice.  Well, your buddy there, Howard, he is a bit soft on some of the acts.  I guess you can't just wheel in there and go like.  He's mellowing out though.  Yeah.  He can't just go in there though and be like.  He just had a total Grace Kelly to, you know, he had a totally non-controversial, fantastic  discussion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hope I get invited back.  So you think that on the show you'll be more outrageous and you'll speak the truth  if someone's bad.  Um, I didn't say what show it was. 
[02:43:00]  I know, I'm not saying, I'm just saying whatever show it is.  Whatever show you're judging.  Whatever show it is, I shall speak the truth.  Right.  So if someone's lip syncing or all that stuff, you're going to, you're going to call them  out.  You know, I did the Billboard Awards once and I refused to lip sync and it was a huge  mistake.  Oh really?  Why?  Yeah.  Cause there's like this little delay and cause I thought it was just, I can't say I thought  it was gay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Homosexual fans.  I love you.  I do say gay sometimes.  Okay.  Um, I thought it was just lame and, um, we actually sounded worse. 
[02:43:30]  Wow.  They were doing accu-tuning back then and whatever.  And I think Kid Rock said something on the Billboard Awards about people that lip sync, but he's  got a lip sync.  We all lip sync now.  Yeah.  On those shows.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh man.  That's kind of.  Why is the sound like shit?  Why can't they get that sound?  I don't know.  Like do a sound check earlier in the day.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It does suck though.  Have you ever heard the Chili Peppers without Anthony's voice accutuned?  Oh.  Not going there.  Sorry.  Well, you know, accutuned is something they do live. 
[02:44:00]  Is that like.  No, no, no.  They can do it live, but it's where if you're hitting flats and sharps, they can.  It rounds it up to where it's supposed to be.  Yeah.  Puts it where it's supposed to be.  It's what they did with Mary J. Blige's voice, in my opinion.  Mary J. Blige had this fantastic, phenomenal, soulful, wounded, great voice.  And lately, what I hear is really accutuned.  Yeah.  And it's like, Barbie, where are you?  And have you used that? 
[02:44:30]  For me?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  I'm white.  You know, I don't hear it.  You like it?  You like it?  No.  You're not going to do that.  But the live shows you do, it's all real.  You don't use any of that stuff.  Yeah, of course.  But Anthony Kiedis doesn't sound great live, huh?  If you take that away.  I would say, without insulting one of my oldest friends who let me use his rehearsal space  before I even had a band, therefore I wouldn't even be here without Flea, that Anthony's voice 
[02:45:00]  is slightly banal without a little something-something like reverb or something like that.  Well, when they first started, he wasn't even on key a lot of the times.  That was kind of the way the music was written, too.  And then later on, they got very popular.  It was more of a pop thing, and it needed to be on key and everything.  Yeah, he was very loose with his being either flat or sharp with a lot of things.  There was like something that was, there was like a lack of personality for a while. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And when you're in studios, you hear people's voices naked.  Which, I mean, you hear your own voice naked.  It's embarrassing enough.  But when you're hearing other people's voices naked, it's like taking a look at them showering.  Yeah, I think that's why you can never...  So it's kind of like tattling on it isn't really cool.  You can never really get the impact of what people are going to hear on a record.  You can't really tell what people are going to hear on a record because you hear it as  you're singing it, and you hear just bear through the cans. 
[02:46:00]  And every time you listen to that song, even through when they're processing it...  Unless you're in love with yourself.  Well, yeah, but who is?  I am.  Are you?  Really?  Really?  Well, when you hear yourself back, does it usually sound better or worse than you first  thought it was going to sound?  Like if you listen back to a tape, it's like, wow, I thought I was worse.  Oh, it sounds better than you thought.  Yeah.  Sounds fantastic.  I think I'm hot.  I'm sorry.  I'm awesome.  What do you think of Amanda Bynes?  You tweeted her recently.  Oh, yeah, that thing.  That thing.  I think she likes the word ugly a lot. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, she uses that for everybody.  It's like, what's that about?  Listen, I was 14.  I was so bloody ugly.  And I thought I was Kate Moss.  I chased this guy named Mark Rennie.  He was the hottest photographer in Portland around.  Convinced him.  I got to show you guys these pictures.  They're so ugly.  You know, I had this big schnoz and I had like blusher on like this and I'm wearing white  gloves and black and white things and I'm like this, like making new wave faces and like  voguing.  And I am so fucking homely and I think I'm in a gap in my teeth and I thought I was the 
[02:47:00]  hottest thing in the world.  And I was 180 pounds.  Wow.  So if someone calls me ugly, it sort of rolls off my back because like it's not about looks.  It's about attitude.  I mean, you get laid on attitude.  But then you think that was kind of shitty because you kind of like, you didn't say  anything bad to her.  No, what I said back to her is you misunderstood me.  And...  Well, your tweet was get it together, dude, I think, right?  No, the first was tweet was get it together, dude, because you're so crazy.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  The wig and this and that. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And marijuana isn't a drug.  Come on.  Clearly, marijuana is a drug.  Leads to other drugs.  And then there's this whole thing about like Disney kids just like, they're not educated.  Look at how she writes.  And, you know, I'm not educated either, but I'm at least autodidactic.  At least I try and read Flabert.  Do you know what I mean?  Just pronounce it correctly.  And they have no parental infrastructure.  And they just get it like, after they're not nubile anymore or useful, they're sort of 
[02:48:00]  waylaid.  Just lose it.  Yeah.  And then we all pick on them.  She comes up.  She comes up with a little bum.  And enjoy it.  Well, we love a train wreck.  Yeah, but it's like...  Who doesn't love a train wreck?  Model your thing on Lohan, man.  Like...  Right.  Yeah.  And we do look at it until something tragic happens.  And then everybody's like, oh, you know, she should have had help and this.  But meanwhile, everyone was piling on the dog pile like that.  Yeah.  You kind of went through a period in time, though, where you were...  Honestly, you were looked at like that. 
[02:48:30]  Like the crazy chick.  Everything that...  I still kind of am.  That's why I want to do this television show.  Because there are people in Lubbock, Texas, that still think I'm on a stretcher in 2003  going to Bellevue for crack.  It's like...  Yeah.  You guys, that was 10 years ago.  And after 72 hours of Bellevue, trust me, you're never doing crack again.  You don't want to go back.  So do you think that people will change their opinion of you after they see you with the young  contestants and stuff like that interacting?  Do we talk about contestants?  Especially on a network, a regular network, like, you know, a real network, not even cable. 
[02:49:00]  Because that's...  Even though the ratings are down, it's still a big show.  Do you know how piss these network guys are?  I mean, come on.  Yeah.  Do not get me in trouble.  But you think that they'll change their opinion after they see your next project?  I don't know.  I can only be myself.  But don't you like...  That's not a bad image to have, because it's interesting.  People always want to see what you're doing.  It's like you're going to stop boring.  Yeah, I just have a problem with cursing.  Yeah.  Because I curse naturally.  Is that right?  No, they do a live show, too.  There's got to be a delay on it.  That could be the problem.  Yeah, that would be a little delay.  I would really say fuck a lot.  Yeah.  So when you do the live show for American Idol, that could be a problem. 
[02:49:30]  Right.  They'll probably say, don't say fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  They might have to put a delay on for you.  But I'll tell you, Courtney, it's really going to help.  It's going to help you live dates.  Sure.  Get Courtney some coffee.  It's definitely going to help your live dates, because I saw it with Steven Tyler when I  went to see Aerosmith after he was on the show.  How many more people, like younger people, guys bringing their kids and stuff to the show.  So it's definitely going to help if you want to get back out there, do whole or your solo  stuff.  No, I want to put out new music.  Yeah, it's going to be huge for you.  You need coffee?  I want blonde. 
[02:50:00]  It's called blonde.  Sweet and blonde.  I know the blonde coffee from Starbucks.  Yeah.  I know it.  No, no, no.  But I made up the word before Starbucks started.  Did you?  So you should sue them.  You know what?  What are you doing?  I actually had a lawsuit with Howard Schultz.  Can I say something?  We love you.  You do?  Yeah.  We thought we were going to knock it along for some weird reason.  Why?  I don't know.  You hear the stories over the years.  Yeah, that it burned down your grandma's house, and then I pushed her and stole her  wedding.  All that shit.  No, the thing is, there's rats all over that like ratting and stuff like that. 
[02:50:30]  So somebody had said, oh, Courtney's bashing you on Howard.  Now, you weren't bashing.  You just don't know us.  Right, right.  You just don't know us.  But you know how people are, especially on Twitter and stuff.  They're just like, you could say something, and it could be the most innocent thing.  It's like, yeah, that person's bashing you.  What are they like?  I said, what are they like?  Are they shock jokes?  Are they like coming for your crowd?  Right, right, right.  They're crying.  Howard knows.  Howard knows.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  We go way back with Howard.  You smell really good.  You do.  Thank you.  And I mean this in a complimentary way. 
[02:51:00]  It reminds me of what Ozzy wears.  It smells good.  Wow.  But a feminine version of it.  It smells really good.  Oh, you know what's interesting about that?  It's called Back in Black, and the top note is Tobacco.  And that's kind of Roxville.  And then the second note is Cherry.  And then the third note is...  Vanilla.  No, I want to say Pussy.  But it's not.  So Courtney, is this these live dates, is this a solo band or is this whole?  This is, I'm calling it Courtney Love. 
[02:51:30]  Okay, so...  But it's my guitar player, Mikko.  And I would take Melissa back in a second, but I'll never take Eric back.  Oh.  Why?  Why?  What happened with you and Eric?  He took 74 guitars from my storage.  18 of them were Kurt's.  They're left-handed.  Jeez.  And then when he gets, he needs money, he sells, he has sold.  Like, Kurt went to England and got all these Marshall stacks, like seven out of ten Marshalls  are lemons.  So for a guy with perfect pitch, like Kurt, you know, and Mikko, who's in my band now, 
[02:52:00]  going to the Marshall factory and getting the non-lemons is a big thing.  Me, I don't give a shit.  I don't have perfect pitch.  Me and Anthony.  That's it.  You know, so...  Anyway, they stay whole on one side, Nirvana on the other side, and he sold them.  Wow.  And then he sold, like, a headstock that Kurt had broke for, like, a hundred grand.  And, you know, it's like, there's this guy in B.C. who collects stuff, and he's a bit 
[02:52:30]  gross, like, he collects, like, syringes, he collects pill bottles, and Paul Allen also  has 45,000 plus items that came, that are, like, basically the contents of me and Francis  and Kurt's entire home, and that's a long story, and I don't want to make allegations  against Paul Allen on your radio show, because he's got more lawyers than I do.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  But, um...  Wait, but how would he get that stuff?  I gotta ask you, yeah.  Well, I can tell you, but then the lawyers would really, I'd have a lawyer... 
[02:53:00]  Because that's a lot of, potentially, potentially a lot of money there, obviously, and...  Yeah, and the less I talk about it, probably the more, um, discreetly, and it will be to  get that shit out of there.  But you gotta be out of your mind about it, obviously.  Um, I'm pissed.  I'm pissed that...  Mostly I'm pissed that the guitar tech, who was really sweet and nice, um...  Um, we found out that he has 16, so there's 38, Kurt, there's only 38 Kurt guitars in the 
[02:53:30]  world, and he has, so Kurt, uh, Eric has 17, we have 12, and then Ernie has the remaining  X amount in a storage space in Washington that he loans out to Paul Allen's museum.  And it's a matter...  And he did a deposition in Canada that got no press, and it's really a matter of finding  out, um, proving that Paul's sister, Jody, knew about it, because Jody Allen kind of put  it together.  If she didn't know about it, she didn't know about it. 
[02:54:00]  But, um...  How did you...  How is it like...  It's almost like in the Holocaust, when they stole paintings and sold them, they were eventually  returned.  They did it to the Hendricks family.  The EMP Music Project did it to the Hendricks family.  They came to my house, and this guy, Peter Blecka, he's the curator there, he showed me pictures  of things, like I said, needles, spoons, pill bottles, you know, things you don't want  on display, and asked me, and I answered the door, this is 1998, so he died in 94, so this 
[02:54:30]  is four years later, and I answered the door in his long johns, Kurt's long johns, he goes,  oh, you're wearing artifacts.  I'm like, no, I'm wearing my dead husband's clothes.  Oh my God.  Like, what?  And then he wanted a bunch of stuff, and I figured Paul is really rich.  I'm like, okay, give me a foundation, I'll give you some stuff.  And they weren't playing ball.  And then I put everything in storage with my name on it, so it said Courtney Love.  Which is like a big fucking red flag.  And then sometime in 03, the name got changed to a corporate name, and it went in arrears 
[02:55:00]  after 90 days, and they did an auction, a public auction.  Wow.  Oh my God.  But there's a good part to it, which is somebody was so stupid, they left their real name.  Uh-huh.  So were they saying you weren't paying your monthly storage bill?  Yeah, they changed it to a corporate name.  And what was the monthly storage bill?  Like, what was it?  Was it a couple hundred bucks a month?  Fifteen hundred bucks.  A month?  A month?  Okay.  And so for that, they changed it.  And so whoever this person is paid something like fifteen hundred bucks for eighteen holds. 
[02:55:30]  Wow.  And got everything.  And Frances asked me recently for this chair of her dad's, and I'm like, I don't have it.  Oof.  It's an experienced music project.  So...  I don't see that on StoryForce.  We'll see how that goes.  No kidding.  I'll be a hell of a story.  This is an interview.  No.  Well, it's amazing how they, like, Bobby Fisher, the chess player, he had his, he had stuff  in storage, valuable stuff.  Yeah.  And somehow somebody else got a hold of it, and it was like, it's your personal shit. 
[02:56:00]  They put your name into a corporation, and you go three months without paying it.  Then they put a little teeny ad in, like, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, that says, you are  going to have a sale, or, you know, Acme, LLC, Woodside 944 is having a sale.  Because that way your name's not on it, so no one comes.  No one knows what they're selling.  And only one person, a sale.  I understand.  I understand.  Wow.  And they take it all back to us.  That's sleazy, man.  Who has the... 
[02:56:30]  And it was in Anaheim, California.  Who has the Lead Belly guitar?  You mean the Nixon Now?  Wasn't, didn't Kirk get a Lead Belly guitar?  He did have one.  I don't know where it is.  Ernie might have it.  Um, the last guitar he played, um, on Unplugged, Frances Wants, though.  She wants to keep that.  Who has that?  That's an art pack.  I have that.  Oh, you have that.  Frances and me have that.  So you and Frances are okay now?  You guys are on good terms?  We talk.  We haven't seen each other in three years.  Wow.  We just miss each other at Coachella, because we went on different days. 
[02:57:00]  And so we talk a lot.  Yeah.  So you're getting that back together a little bit?  Yeah, that's good.  You guys had some rough roads?  Good.  Good for you.  You're not going to pull an OJ and try to get your shit back, are you?  Because OJ got all of his stuff stolen, and he found out some people had and went in  with guns, and he's been in jail.  That's why he's in jail now, yeah?  Yeah.  For four years already?  Five years already?  No.  That sounds like good fodder for fantasies.  No shit.  I don't think I could kill anybody.  I could probably knee someone if I was mad at him. 
[02:57:30]  You could hurt someone, just not to, yeah.  There's a bang in the knee, but I have to be really mad.  You never beat up somebody before?  Yeah, I have three assault charges.  Damn.  But no convictions.  I guess they're also guys.  Yeah, no, I can go to Japan.  That is a good one.  I'm cool for Japan.  That is a good one.  Who lives in the old house?  What old house?  In Seattle, yeah.  The old house that we lived in?  Yeah.  This Microsoft lady who does one of the little kids that come next door for their pilgrimage  is...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's got to be.  It's a really waspy neighborhood, too. 
[02:58:00]  That's where Howard Schultz, Starbucks guy, he pulled a 1901 easement on me so I couldn't  build a driveway because the city of Seattle picked at him, and then he charged the city  of Seattle with anti-Semitism, hired Rogers and Cowan, da-da-da.  His kid was the same as his and Franny, and he wouldn't let her play with him.  Which I thought was snotty.  And he had built his driveway, like, seriously, two inches onto the thing, Veretta Park, but  it's so waspy, and it really is an anti-Semitic town. 
[02:58:30]  Really.  If you don't like Jews, you don't like show people.  That's a rule.  So, I remember going into this meeting, it's all these wasps, and it was the Friends of  Veretta Park, and if you look at pictures of that thing, I mean, every day, they have  to take the, you know, every whatever month, they have to take the bench down because  people write shit on the bench because his ashes aren't anywhere because no graveyard  in Washington that's in the Willamette Valley will take his ashes.  Why?  That doesn't sound right. 
[02:59:00]  So, it's a suicide's a felony in Washington.  It's actually, in some states, it's considered mental illness.  Right.  But in Washington state, for insurance reasons, because lobbies tend to make a lot of laws,  suicide is a very, it's very high, it's very high by men with guns, and so the insurance  lobbies made it into a felony.  So, you can't...  So, there's no life insurance.  No life insurance, you got it.  You got it.  That's it.  So, where are the ashes?  It took me, by the way, I have a lot of them.  Oh, you split them up a little bit?  I split them up with his mom, yeah. 
[02:59:30]  And so, she has them in this Tibetan stupa.  And then there's some under a willow tree.  That we don't know what to do with the bloody willow tree, though.  Because she's moving out of that house.  Oh, shit.  So, dig it up.  But I don't want to give it to Paul Allen, and so we straighten this little mess out.  So, dig up the willow tree.  And bring it...  Yeah, put where?  I don't know.  Central Park.  How do you do that?  Yeah, it's hard to carry a willow tree.  Put it in the back of a...  Willow trees are really delicate.  I'll take it.  No, you can have a...  I'll take it. 
[03:00:00]  I'll take it.  I'll take it.  I'll take it.  I'll take it.  I'll take it.  I'll take it.  I'll take it.  I'll take it.  No, we can't leave it there.  It's grown.  We'll take it.  And it's got a beautiful house.  You want the willow tree in it?  I don't think I could use the willow tree.  I think it should be like a public willow tree.  I think you're right.  But I don't know.  I don't want to do that Yoko Strawberry Fields.  Yeah, yeah.  Right, right.  It's not really me.  No.  Yeah, but at least Strawberry Fields is kind of protected.  You want it to be somewhere public that can be watched, because somebody will take it.  Yeah, that's why I thought of Paul Allen, because he sort of owns, what was I saying? 
[03:00:30]  Oh, I don't know.  Now, I want to make sure that this whole Experience Music Project, which is that museum thing,  is clean, and that my stuff isn't there.  Right.  So, in order to do that, there needs to be dialogue, and there needs to be dialogue between lawyers.  And as Shakespeare said, first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.  One other question, because I think you've got to go.  Yeah.  Where are you at with Dave Grohl these days?  I don't know.  You guys cool?  You know, I got to Pat Smear a little while ago, and about two weeks ago, Pat was the only other person in L.A. that could not drive. 
[03:01:00]  And he was also really happy, and when Kurt wanted somebody in his band that was happy,  he wasn't that great a guitar player, but he was fucking happy.  So, I said, I know this guy that's really, really happy,  and he was working for minimum wage at the SST Superstore with my first husband, Pauline James.  And Pauline James said to him, if you join that band, you're selling out.  Wow, no kidding.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  This guy was a tranny that I married in Las Vegas.  It's an annulment.  Holy shit.  A whole backstory thing.  It's in my wiki.  Who knew we had so much in common to my wiki?  We all do it, right?  I, of course, do.  Courtney Jim is into trannies, so that's what I was saying.  Really, I married a tranny in Las Vegas.  Oh, wow.  That was funny.  No, I came back to the club lingerie.  Peppers were there.  L7 was there.  Gun club guys were there.  I said, I just married Pauline James, and no one laughed.  Really?  Now, if these people aren't laughing, I did something bad. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, man.  And then, I didn't have money for a lawyer for like a year, so it took me a year to get  an annulment.  He was really into pantyhose.  Yeah, of course.  So, when Kirk called Pat at the SEC Superstore, Pauline Davis was there, he's like, if you join  Nirvana, you're selling out.  So, Pat, to this day, is in the Foo Fighters, and he said, you know, every time this shit  comes up, Dave says, I have nothing to do with it.  He goes, you know, have you ever thought that it could just be the lawyers?  And that actually is food for thought.  But, when I went on Howard, and I said, many years ago, I said, I'll have lunch with him. 
[03:02:30]  He went on Howard, and he was like, you know, basically, fuck her.  So, it's not a Yoko thing about us.  What it is, is it's not even a dislike thing on my end.  It's that, first of all, I had absolutely no awareness of how big they were until a few  months ago, when I bought my guitar player a Telecaster, looked up a Guitar Center, and  saw what I thought was the Super Bowl.  It was a Foo Fighters show.  Holy fuck, they're big.  You had no idea? 
[03:03:00]  They're huge.  Arenas.  We all know them.  Like, big arenas.  But how did it take you so long to know that?  That's not even the point.  The point is, is that there's a financial issue with, like, money market accounts, pension  plans, da-da-da-da, under something called Nirvana Inc. that doesn't include Francis,  and I need to get to the bottom of what that is, and maybe it's just lawyers, because lawyers  are hacks in rock and roll.  So, you know, but I'm so sick of lawyers.  I just want to play rock.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're telling us you have to leave. 
[03:03:30]  But it's Courtney, C-O-U-R-T-N-E-Y, on Twitter.  Hey, Courtney, real quick.  Do you think Nirvana would still be together today if Kurt was alive?  No.  Of course not.  But I don't know if we'd still be together.  He might be married to a model, and living on the Upper West Side, and, you know, have  twins, and we might be in Twitter wars.  You never know.  You never know.  Was he ready to leave Nirvana?  That rumor was out there.  Yeah, I mean, you got to talk to Azrad and Charlie Cross.  That unplugged album showed his talent. 
[03:04:00]  I mean, we all knew how talented he was, but that unplugged album and his voice, holy fuck.  I know, I was listening to All Apologies, Howard was playing it.  Howard doesn't play Nirvana a lot.  I think he was doing it because I was there.  Right.  It's like, I wasn't in Nirvana, I was in a hole.  Ah, yeah.  So I'm going to go on Lithium after this, and it's a 90s station, and all I'm going to play  is Chicks.  That's cool.  Yeah, because all they play, somebody told me they still play Bush all day.  It's like, I know, can you believe it?  Bush!  And like, Soundgarden, and like... 
[03:04:30]  A lot of Soundgarden.  STP.  I know, but I'm not playing any of that.  Puddle of Mud.  I'm playing like PJ Harvey, Elastica, Verve.  I'm not playing Veruca Salt because I'm playing The Breeders.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, The Breeders are cool.  Now, were you married to a transvestite or a transsexual?  Like a cross-dresser or a transvestite?  Oh, okay.  But he wasn't into women per se.  Oh.  Did he have breasts?  No.  No good for me.  No good for me.  No?  What's your name?  Jim.  Oh, nice.  Oh, here we go. 
[03:05:00]  Gordon just gave my chest and I squeezed.  What are these called?  Breasts?  Man boobs.  Not as bad as they used to be.  I know.  I'm giving you a...  They're normally called pecs.  A mammogram.  A manogram.  I like the nipple play.  What's the guy's name with the cowboy hat?  Don Imus.  Don Imus.  Yeah, what's his thing?  He's like really right wing?  No, he's just an older man.  He's not too sure of what he should say and shouldn't say sometimes.  I see.  He's just an older gentleman.  Does he say stupid shit?  He thinks right.  Sometimes, yeah.  I see.  He's been known to say some stupid shit, but who hasn't really?  Yeah, we've all blurted out some dumb shit. 
[03:05:30]  I don't know about that.  It happens, you know.  All right.  I will say that felt very good.  There was a little bit of almost nipple play there, and I'm very happy you did that.  Oh, that's right.  Let me just give you a little.  Courtney.  I like that.  You can take it.  You can take it.  You can take it.  He likes that.  Courtney, Jim, that's like his favorite thing.  He likes to get his nipples pinched.  He loves nipple play.  He loves nipple play.  I like that a lot.  I sense that.  We really got to get her out of here.  All right.  All this testosterone smells nice.  I know, right?  All right.  Oh, my God.  I love the smell of testosterone in the morning.

[03:10:30]  This week, Tom Papa's SiriusXM show, Come to Papa.  Welcome, everybody, to a very special edition of Come to Papa.  I'm Tom Papa, and my guest today is the great Colin Quinn.  We have moved heaven and earth to get Colin in here right away, because we need to talk to him about his amazing one-man show playing at the Barrow Street Theater right now through June 3rd, entitled Unconstitutional. 
[03:11:00]  I was lucky enough to be at the opening for the show last week, and you have to go see it immediately.  In much the same vein as his Broadway show, Long Story Short, Colin has taken a gigantic subject and boiled it down to the perfect comedic size for the rest of us.  And to me, that is the amazing thing about this show.  Yes, it is smart.  Yes, it is current.  But more than that, it is so damn funny.  Really, I've seen so many hour specials.  I rank this up there with even Keith Robinson's. 
[03:11:30]  Tickets are available at ColinQuinnUnconstitutional.com.  You've got to see it.  It's at the Barrow Street Theater.  It's an amazing space downtown in the village.  Colin, thank you for being here.  I feel like you have now taken and become like Nathan Lane's status.  Yeah.  Where you've stepped away from the comedy clubs, and now you have a theater air about you. 
[03:12:00]  Well, Tom, I don't look at it that way, but I certainly will never sully myself by being part of any of the soiled comedy clubs in this United States again.  For too long, they've destroyed my creativity, my incentive, my financial status in the community.  I joke, but at the same time, I'm dead serious.  When you see your show, which I saw last Thursday night, you're like, this is where he should be.  This stuff should not be told in front of 18-year-old kids trying to just make out with their girlfriend, and they don't know who's on stage. 
[03:12:30]  To be in a theater with people, there's no drinks being served.  It's all smart people.  The focus is purely on you, and you get to really immerse yourself in the show, which doesn't happen in a comedy club.  No, because like you said, well, first of all, even when I did Long Story Short on Broadway, they were serving drinks.  People were getting up and going to get Jell-O shots during the show.  That's what Broadway's become.  On Broadway?  Jell-O shots. 
[03:13:00]  They were selling a lot.  They thought that was cute.  It's like, guess what, producers?  I don't find it funny.  People are getting drunk when I'm trying to do a show.  It's true.  I saw Book of Mormon, and at the break, they literally stand there with T-shirts and stuff in the aisle.  But this was not at the break.  I'm saying, while I'm on stage, people are allowed to get up, walk to the back, go pee, which that's fine with me.  But then they're getting Jell-O shots, too.  They're drinking and coming back with their shots.  One time, a guy up front was actually in the front row on Broadway, was drinking and chewing the ice and throwing me off. 
[03:13:30]  And I swear to God, I just looked down at him, and I was just going to rip into him.  And I looked down, and he was the biggest, baddest.  He must have been like an MMA guy that somebody got a ticket.  He just looked up at me like, you have something to say?  And I just kept on with the show.  I was like, you big monster.  If I was just starting to break your face.  Are you allowed to go off book and start playing with the audience?  Yeah, because, I mean, you have to be careful.  You don't want to ruin the whole vibe.  But there isn't a thing like you've got to stick to the script on Broadway.  No, because there's nobody else you have to worry about. 
[03:14:00]  It's not like a play where if your one line is messed up, everybody in the play gets screwed.  Right, right.  You can screw around.  Why don't you want to bring this one to Broadway?  Oh, I don't know.  I just didn't.  I mean, I don't even care.  I think Broadway's great for musicals and big plays.  But you know what I mean?  It's a one-man show.  I mean, I would bring it if somebody brought big bags of money.  But otherwise, you can't make that much money.  Right.  Because you've got to pay off.  You know, Broadway plays make money as they go on for years.  Right.  Or as they go on the road, road companies. 
[03:14:30]  Right.  Or just any original cast, unless you get paid a lot up front, nobody's going to make money.  I didn't make money off their show.  How did the Defending Caveman guy make money?  He went on the road for years.  Oh, really?  But also, he wasn't doing Broadway.  He did Broadway after he was already made the money.  Oh, so he toured that show forever?  He toured that show.  And what he did, which was smart, or at least the legend has it, was he was the guy that marketed  his manager or him, I think his manager was that guy, Robin, that used to run Catch years  ago. 
[03:15:00]  Right.  And they went to, allegedly, they went to all the couples counselors all over the country.  Every city they'd go into a month early, they'd go, hey, we'd like to invite you to a free  show for you and your guests.  So all the couples counselors would go.  They'd see the show and go, this is what I deal with every day.  And then they'd tell the people coming to the therapy, hey, you know, if you want to  do something as a couple, you guys need to go out as a couple.  I got a good idea, but I'll show there's a difference between men and women.  Right.  Go see this.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  So they would go in and market the thing before you even got to town. 
[03:15:30]  That's the word.  But either way, even if it's not true, it's brilliant.  And then he toured it like that forever, and then they decided to put it on Broadway.  Yeah, that was on Broadway years after.  Oh.  No, yeah.  And I'm sure they made some money on Broadway, but like I said, it's just from constant touring  the same thing.  Now, when you do your show, so much goes into it.  You've been writing it for what, a year and a half?  A year.  A year?  Well, ten and a half months.  Wow.  Less than a year.  That's amazing.  It's such a tight set. 
[03:16:00]  Nice.  Well, I've been working like a beast on it, too.  Yeah.  Now, are you writing it the same way?  Like, when I would see Carlin was writing his stuff almost like a script.  He was writing his material, his stand-up stuff.  I remember seeing him back at the Comedy Magic Club, and he had his stuff, and he was literally  memorizing paragraph by paragraph.  Wow.  And then going up and doing it.  And I thought, well, that's kind of a weird way.  I've never seen someone do a set like that.  I know.  I can't do that.  You didn't do that for this show?  No.  I always, I can't memorize it like that. 
[03:16:30]  Right.  So you just would work it like a stand-up set?  Yeah.  Work it like that.  I'm working the seller sometimes.  Right.  And every time something works, I get the seller.  I get excited because I'm like, wow.  If stuff can work in stand-up clubs.  Right.  And it's not stand-up stuff, but then you feel good.  Right.  So you don't treat it like, oh, I'm doing a one-man show.  You just treat it like, is there any difference between?  I treat it like, yeah, that it's thematic.  Right.  Because stand-up clubs, the crowd, even after five minutes of talking about any subject, 
[03:17:00]  I don't care what it is.  Right.  Unless it's sex, then you can talk an hour.  They're looking at you like, come on, change the subject.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Of any subject.  Any subject except sex.  Yeah.  They can listen in five hours.  But I mean, so any other subject, they're like, come on, move on now.  This is the way stand-up is.  You go from here to here to here.  So this is like, no, this is the same subject.  What made you decide to do the Constitution?  Because all my life, or at least the past few years, everyone says the Constitution is 
[03:17:30]  brilliant.  And I was like, why?  What's so brilliant about it?  Well, I don't get it.  What's so brilliant?  Founding Fathers are geniuses.  I was like, what?  What's so great about it?  So then I read it, and I was still sort of understood a little bit, but then I was like,  let me figure this out, you know?  Right.  And so that's what it is.  Are you impressed by it now?  Yes, I am.  I'm impressed by the Founding Fathers.  I'm impressed by the Constitution.  You are?  Yeah.  Why?  Because they basically said, look, here's the way a society works.  Just because you think these people are wrong, you want to be part of the society with them 
[03:18:00]  too bad.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Listen, like what's happening in our country right now.  Too bad if we don't like Texas and they don't like us.  If you guys want to be together, you're going to have to learn to deal with it or break up.  Right.  Too bad that you don't like their values or we don't like your values.  Right.  And obviously it causes a lot of problems.  Yeah.  But when you consider a history of 230 years, the amount of pogrom, genocide, you know,  the stuff that happens in a lot of other countries when people don't get along doesn't happen  here.  Right.  Yet. 
[03:18:30]  And I know.  But either way, it's never happened so far.  So that means they did.  They were doing something.  They understand that balance of power.  They understand everybody will abuse power.  They knew they would.  Right.  They knew everybody would.  Do you think that are you impressed by the human rights aspect of it all that they?  I want my human right.  You're what?  There's some scar face.  I want my human right.  Like your president Jimmy Carter said.  Because you're talking about it more as a as a almost as a state preservation. 
[03:19:00]  But do you see it as an individual?  No, I mean, it goes all the way down.  Yeah.  It's not just a state preservation.  It's down to the individual.  That's what the Bill of Rights was, really.  And was there a thing about slavery in it originally and they pulled it out?  No.  Was that a Declaration of Independence?  No.  Slavery was, like I said, the founding fathers, the North was getting rid of slavery.  That was their whole mission statement.  Right.  They went down there.  They were going to get rid of it.  And then they sold it out for a couple of reasons. 
[03:19:30]  But I mean, you know, tobacco being one, probably.  But also because they said, look, it's more important that we get together.  We'll put a pin in it.  Sorry, brother.  It was bad.  And so they said 1808 was that you could stop importation of slaves.  And then the three-fifths compromise, people always talk about it, but it had nothing to  do with slavery other than slaves only counted as three-fifths of a person.  Right.  Which the South wanted.  The North didn't want to count them at all.  They didn't.  Because it was voting.  It was just a voting thing.  But it was really... 
[03:20:00]  That was the motivation for this?  The sellout was the fugitive slave clause.  That was the other thing.  1808 was, they said, no more importation of slaves.  So you could still have slaves.  This was all because the South was like, we're walking away.  We're out.  And why did the North want it out?  Want slavery out?  Yeah.  You mean just humanity?  Yeah.  They didn't have slaves.  So it wasn't an economic thing?  It was just...  No, it wasn't economic at all.  It was not...  No, not everything was economic.  Everybody always thinks the founding fathers, oh, they're all like the white slave man.  Right.  You know, like they're all just about themselves.  But then I read all these boring, incredibly tedious books written like in 1930 about it. 
[03:20:30]  Right.  And you realize, no, most of their motives were not...  They came into the thing in debt.  Most of them died without that much money.  Right.  So, I mean, you know, it wasn't all evil, but...  Right.  So there was a real...  Because, yeah, you do get that rap that, well, it was just economic and white people didn't  really want to end slavery.  You hear that?  Right.  No, they all wanted to...  All the North wanted to end slavery.  Yeah.  Do you feel like we should have kept slavery?  Well, you know, Tom, it's funny.  I was just thinking about that. 
[03:21:00]  Coming down on the A-train.  I mean, yeah, I mean, slavery is one of the...  Slavery, the two things that screwed up was the big ones, in my opinion, is slavery.  Yeah.  And then this guy, Governor Morris.  This guy, when they were trying to decide about the Senate's separation of powers, he's  like, look, he was very rich, really rich.  And actually, Morris Park in the Bronx is named after him.  Show us how much money he's fallen.  Was he from in New York?  Look, he was in New York, and he said, look, here's what you do. 
[03:21:30]  The Senate should be made up of all the richest people in the country.  The richest people.  And the rest of them are like, what?  He goes, listen to me.  I know I'm rich.  He goes, these people are going to do what they're going to do anyway.  This way, you're saying, you're acknowledging that they're at odds with the people.  Right.  By making them the Senate and the people who's represented, supposedly, the House of Reps.  Right.  And everybody's like, oh, that's too cynical.  What are you talking?  But that would have been, especially in light of the past 20, 40 years, whatever. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  That would have been the perfect thing, because then everything's out in the open, and you're  saying, okay, this is a conflict.  Right.  You're acknowledging there's a conflict.  But just a class conflict.  Well, a financial conflict in the sense that now, people are like, no business.  It's like, it's muddied.  So you're like, wait, but they develop jobs, or they create jobs.  Instead of saying, wait, there's going to be a conflict when people get really rich.  Right.  There has to be.  Right.  He understood that, and nobody else seemed to understand that in the whole thing.  It's just like, ah, you're being cynical. 
[03:22:30]  This guy's like crazy.  Right.  He was like, you know, he was the guy.  He's also the guy.  Doesn't it exist like that now?  Yes.  No, but I'm saying.  But you're saying it's not.  It's kind of opaque now.  It's murky, because nobody says that.  Well, people say it, but nobody really.  There's no system set up where that's going to be a conflict.  Right.  So you have to deal with it.  You have to deal with it legally and ideologically in your head.  Right.  But also, this guy, Governor Morris, who's apparently the great hero of the Constitution,  subtly to me.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, me being in the last, like, five minutes.  But he also was the guy that wrote it. 
[03:23:00]  Like, the way it's set up.  So, all those things were in the, by the way, to any reviewers who said I had it out  of order.  No.  The order, I had it in order.  They discussed slavery and judicial and the other stuff.  They put the order later with Article I.  That was Governor Morris.  He organized it all.  Oh, yeah.  So, all that stuff was not in the order they discussed.  They didn't discuss Article I first, Article II second, Article III third.  Oh, I see.  They did it the way I said it was done. 
[03:23:30]  And then they put it in order at the end.  Why did some critics say he was in the order?  Yeah.  Some critics say, well, he's all over the place.  Obviously, he says Article II, then he goes back to Article I.  Once you read it, you see what I'm saying.  That infuriated me.  Only because of the work I did.  God forbid.  I do one bit of work, and I'm like, hey, wait a minute.  I was fully acknowledged.  Now, you didn't tour this around.  This was all in New York, right?  Creaking Cave.  Creaking Cave.  Yeah.  Just went there.  I worked it out for a year, Creaking Cave.  Wow. 
[03:24:00]  And then played with it a little bit, a couple of road gigs, you know.  Just played with some of it.  But, you know, halfway through, I'd usually either abandon.  Some places it worked, but I'd abandon, go back into stand-up.  I mean, I'm doing stand-up dates three weeks ago.  I was in Atlanta.  I mean, I can't do the show there.  Yeah.  I can't do the show anywhere, as far as it's not a stand-up show.  No, it's not.  And even, like, you're not heavy on visuals in the show.  Right.  But it helps.  Yes.  When you're dealing with a subject that big.  Yes. 
[03:24:30]  Even you just changing location on stage, the blocking, and a couple of the visuals that  come up.  For a long subject, you kind of need those things.  You need it.  And it just reminds people, good, this is this, you know.  Right, right.  But, yeah, I mean, I love doing it.  And I love, I love, you know, because I love stand-up, like, honestly.  Yeah.  Everybody's like, oh, my God, you're the only one that could do this.  No, I'm not.  Any stand-up that's been doing it for a while, that's good, can do anything.  My opinion.  Right.  Is any stand-up that, I mean, it's a pain in the ass. 
[03:25:00]  And it's also, you know, it's hard to get the time to do it.  I happen to have the time.  You know what I mean?  But I'm saying, but any stand-up that took one subject could do it now.  Any good stand-up.  I know they could.  Yeah.  Just because I know them.  What subject do you think I should do?  I think you should do, well, I think you should do, well, not a historical subject necessarily,  but if you did do a subject, it would have to do with being a man in today's society,  which your act has that theme anyway.  Right.  And it would have to be being married and some kind of interaction, it would have to 
[03:25:30]  be related, you'd have to find something that's related to it, whether it be an energy in  the world or the conflict, the conflict of being, you know.  The rise of woman against man.  Well, I don't think it's the rise of woman against man, but the, just, it's almost like  a psychological, the psychological reckoning.  Right.  You have to deal with, you're like, okay, this is me now. 
[03:26:00]  Even the title, this is me now.  Right.  You have to have a complete transformation, I would assume.  Right.  Where you're like, okay, this is me now.  You have to, at some point.  Yeah.  Unless you're going to be a dickhead who's not really a good father and husband, you  have to say, this is me now.  Yeah.  Or, you know, like the guys that are still like, hey, I'm the, you know, they're still  wearing like skull shirts in their late thirties and they're like, I'm still crazy,  you know.  And, you know, like they don't want to acknowledge that they're now.  They want to be a rocker dad.  Yeah.  There's something about the identity that you have to say, I have to change my identity 
[03:26:30]  for the sake of this to work.  Right.  I have to, you know, shift into another part of myself.  Right.  That who, nobody even knows that exists until they do that.  And that kind of stuff is interesting.  Right.  But I mean, you know, that being said, like I say, any of these shit, anybody who talks  about any subject, it better be joke, joke, joke, joke, joke.  Right.  Or else we're not staying.  You don't, like if I went up there and people like that was really interesting about the  constitution, I'd be embarrassed.  Right.  When I was working on it, somebody came up after a show and gave me the greatest insult 
[03:27:00]  any comedian could have.  He goes, hey man, you gave me a lot to think about there.  And I was like, oh, because we want laughs, you know.  I know.  For good reason.  I know.  Well, that's what was really so great about this show.  And I don't, I can't compare it to a long story short, because that was dense with laughs  too.  But I just, I only saw it a couple of times.  I don't really remember as much as I do this one, of course, but this one is so, this  is a killer.  If you were to go to any comedy club or any HBO special or anything, this has, it's packed 
[03:27:30]  with, not just laughs, good, poignant laughs.  But Tom, as much as I appreciate that, we just got through for 20 minutes saying it wouldn't  work in a comedy club.  And now you just said, if you were to go to any comedy club with this.  No, I'm saying you could hold it up against anybody else's hour and a half.  Ah, thanks.  Because.  Yeah, no, it's got laughs.  Yeah.  But like you said, I worked on, I worked on it a lot.  I mean, I was sitting there every night going to Creaking Cave, working out, Rebecca, 
[03:28:00]  you know, she's the director.  And we sat there every night and I was just working it with these stupid sheets of paper,  which I still have plenty of.  You bring them on stage with you?  But that's a funny thing.  You work on something.  Yeah.  The first six months I brought them on stage.  Oh, yeah.  And that's the funny thing about these kinds of shows is once you're done with it, like  everyone's like, wow, what do you want to do now?  It's like, I want to never see it again.  I want to never talk about the Constitution again.  Yeah.  I'm sick of it.  You know, you just want to film it and get it out of there.  Yeah.  Along to something else.  Is that going to be the plan?  Will you film it?  I would like to do that.  Yeah.  My other plan for another, I'd like to do another show, but I don't think I could pull 
[03:28:30]  it off.  I'd like to do a show that's basically about a combination of pressure point kill techniques  and like, you know, those energy chi guys that I once went to see this Japanese chi guy.  Yeah.  He was only in from Detroit for the day and he said, jump on top.  There's like 50 people in class.  He picks me.  I was a little heavier at the time.  He goes, climb on top of me and just, you know, don't let me go.  Like put me in like a wrestling hold.  Yeah.  I jump on top.  I grab the guy. 
[03:29:00]  Next day I'm on the other side of the room.  He goes, do it again.  I did it again.  I still don't remember to this day how that happened, how I ended up in the class.  But I'm in the class.  I go, oh, laughing.  And I'd like to do a show where I research that and the pressure point thing, not just  for the entertainment value.  At the end of the show, I want to be able to fling like 20 people across the room.  You know?  Yeah.  Really, this whole comedy thing is a sham, ultimately.  If I could have just been like one of those mad, like, you know, monk, killer monk. 
[03:29:30]  Like a killer monk that can kill people with pressure points.  What guy wouldn't want that?  I would love that.  Great.  But the problem is it seems so easy.  I think the appeal, to me at least, is that for one little, you just have to take two fingers  and you completely control this other human being.  Yeah.  But it seems like it would be easy to learn that.  But it's actually years and years of stuff to be able to do that.  It's years and even then, some guy's 6'8", 240, and he just pushes you and drops you  with a hair.  You're like, oh my God.  You know what I mean? 
[03:30:00]  I can't reach his point.  That's the other problem.  Right.  Well, some guy who's even smaller than you just catches a lucky punch, catches you in  the right place, and you go get dropped, and suddenly you're on the ground flopping  like a fish.  It was like, what happened to the great master that we studied with for years?  Now, why end it June 3rd?  Why not?  Do you want to go further with it?  It may get extended, but there's another show coming in.  Right.  So, you know, they're ready.  They're coming in.  You've got to pack your bags and go.  Yeah.  I want people to see this. 
[03:30:30]  Well, they can see it on, it's being shot.  It is being shot?  You said you didn't know if it was being shot.  I know.  I'm lying.  But maybe it'll be shot.  You're listening to Come to Pop on Sirius XM 99.  I'm here with the great Colin Quinn, and you have to go see his show, Unconstitutional,  playing at the Barrow Street Theater.  You can get tickets at colinquinnunconstitutional.com.  And anywhere else, they should go.  Ticketmaster, you go to Broadway stuff.  Yes.  Just go on the internet.  Smart tics.  Smart tics. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Hit Colin Quinn.  You can't Google by now.  Colin Quinn, Unconstitutional, what's the matter with you people?  Just do that or don't.  But we don't have time to explain every detail and links to you.  You know how to do it.  You have to go see it.  It's awesome.  It's come downtown.  New York is beautiful right now.  Oh, my God.  You can stroll around the village.  It's a nice place to stroll.  It really is.  It's a perfect, perfect block.  Oh, my gosh.  And it's an amazing show.  It looks like Constitutional Convention Hall.  It really does.  And that wasn't even your set. 
[03:31:30]  No, it was a set from Stonewall, which closed.  And then we left it up there because we didn't have money for a set anyway.  How about that awful story?  Speaking of Stonewall, that awful story on 8th Street.  Oh, God.  It's sickening.  It's sickening.  Just shot a guy for being gay?  Yeah.  Right in front of the Barnes & Nobles in Grace Papaya.  Right.  Jeez Louise.  Yeah.  It's brutal.  Just awful.  Terrible.  I'm sorry to bring down the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's been a couple of murders like that around there, you know? 
[03:32:00]  What do you mean, recently?  Yeah.  Really?  Well, a couple of gay bashings.  It was won by right inside the Knicks game.  These guys on 32nd Street.  Really?  Yeah, there's been a few incidences in the past few weeks.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  I wish I was gay.  Yeah.  It just makes things easier.  I wish I was a person.  And then more difficult at the same time.  Well, gay, here's the thing about the gay and lesbian thing.  I figured this out a while ago, but is that they both act, the reason people are a little  freaked out by it is they both act the way men and women really act in their true natures. 
[03:32:30]  Uh-huh.  Lesbians get together, they start nesting, they start buying things, they do all the things  that women fantasize what men will do, carpentry, and sitting around talking, and you know  what I mean?  Right.  Just going out for little strolls to pick up a bowl.  And then gay guys do what we would all do with women if they would go along with the  program, which is meet me, you see somebody in the supermarket, let's go in the back,  hey, let's go in the bushes.  That's what we would all be doing all day.  Right.  They're just guys.  I agree. 
[03:33:00]  They're doing what guys would do.  So it just frustrates.  And speaking of male body image, you've lost a lot of weight for this show.  Well, thanks, Tom.  You really dial it in when you have a show coming up.  I do dial it in because I look at myself.  My problem is that I look at myself and I'm almost like, yeah, you look pretty good.  And then I see a picture of myself and I go, you're fat.  You're fat.  It's true.  Why does everyone say you look good?  You can't listen to anybody.  No, I'm saying even I think I look good in the mirror.  Oh, even you?  Oh, really? 
[03:33:30]  But then when I see a picture, like somebody takes a picture of me, I'm like, you're fat.  But in the mirror, for some reason, I look good.  Maybe I need bigger bulbs.  Maybe you need a fat mirror.  Some mirrors, you know, you ever go to a hotel and you get the skinny mirrors?  Yeah, yeah.  You're like, wow, I look really good.  I love this hotel.  Yeah, but I mean, yeah, you have to always watch it because nobody cares.  That's why.  Nobody cares the kind of shape you're in.  They don't care.  They look at you the way they want to look at you.  Like, yeah, who cares about you?  You're finished anyway.  But you still want to think you look good, especially when you're on stage.  You feel good. 
[03:34:00]  Your clothes fit, right?  And it does give you energy, more energy.  When you're feeling fat and when you're looking fat, you feel like your breath is a little  off.  You feel like your nose is stuffed on stage.  Right.  You're going through the airport with your bags.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, absolutely.  When you're thin, you can delude yourself.  Hey, I'm kind of young still.  I'm in pretty good shape for my age.  You look at some other guy.  You're like, yeah, that guy's younger than me.  He looks horrible.  You know, survival is really about denigrating others, denigrating strangers, setting up 
[03:34:30]  a fake, miserable life for them so you can feel good about yourself.  Are you going to yoga?  No, but I went to yoga once this year and I swear to God, it was, I can't believe I  haven't gone back every day.  It's ridiculous.  I was high like a beast.  I know.  What's wrong with me, man?  I should be going all the time.  I know.  It's the best thing in the world to do.  It's just everything else.  It's hard to do it in New York.  You know what I think it is?  There's a million yoga places here.  I know, but I think it's, people are, it's just dirtier and you're walking with your mat 
[03:35:00]  through the streets and.  I know.  For a guy walking around with a yoga mat, it's a little tough.  It is.  But you know what?  You get one of those army pouches.  You know what I mean?  Like it's like an arrow pouch that they used to carry.  And then you don't know what's in there.  They go, oh, this guy could have like a heavy weaponry.  It could be, it almost looks like an RPG could be in there.  Right.  And then you feel good and they don't have to know it's a purple yoga mat.  So Colin, I feel selfishly like you should be the guy that every two years comes out 
[03:35:30]  with another Broadway show and then I get to go see it and it's.  Well, what about off-Broadway?  What does it have to be on Broadway?  Well, I just say Broadway.  Hey, man.  I just mean theater.  Man, the parameters, man.  It's really not about that.  Yeah, no, I have, like I said, my dream, I'm not even kidding when I say my dream would  be to do a pressure point show.  You're not kidding?  No, I would love to do that, but I'm not going to do that.  That would be a good show.  But I was thinking of doing what, what's the most important thing?  What's the most amazing?  What about inventions?  And I'm talking about real inventions. 
[03:36:00]  I'm talking about like electricity.  electricity, the whole story of Tesla, Edison, this kind of stuff is really interesting.  Right.  And if that meant something in the grand scheme of things, like beyond the invention itself,  does it represent everything since history becomes, like I said, well, there's always  like the nerdy guy that invents it.  Then did he get it stolen?  Right.  And then did the other, did Edison get it stolen from him?  Uh-huh.  And like, it's like whoever invented the car, there's some English guy. 
[03:36:30]  Right.  And suddenly Henry Ford is like the guy.  So like that kind of dynamic is interesting to me too.  Right.  How people take ideas, you know.  Once it becomes part of the culture.  Everybody just takes it.  Everybody starts devouring it.  I mean, you know, it's amazing.  You know, like I, I don't know, all the way to Bill Gates, you know, Bill Gates and Steve  Wozniak and those guys, like they didn't invent all that stuff, but like what, what level  of invention is it?  You know what I mean?  Right.  Because when I, I used to try to do a routine years ago about the fact that, you know, whoever  invents the ShamWow makes, you know, it's worth a hundred million dollars, whatever. 
[03:37:00]  Right.  All these inventions.  And then the guy that invented pizza doesn't make a dime.  He's, nobody knows who he is.  And pizza is worldwide and everyone loves it.  So I'm just saying the different, that those are extreme examples.  Right.  But I mean.  Yeah, it's true.  At a certain point, it just, you're putting in it, then like when Steve Jobs checked out  the tablet, someone else was working on the tablet.  He's like, this isn't a tablet.  We can make a tablet.  Right.  And it's like, there's no problem with that.  You can just take the tablet. 
[03:37:30]  Right.  And make the iPad and make a zillion dollars off of it.  Yes.  That's the thing.  Like, yeah.  So I guess really my next show is about corporate espionage starting in the first century.  From ice cream to Dippin' Dots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I mean, I like that kind of stuff too, but I've, you know, but you can tell like even  that is dry compared to pressure points and throwing people across the room with just  your energy.  Well, why not just, you could have a show about inventions, but then you break in the middle, 
[03:38:00]  you're just like, now pressure points.  And you just go into some pressure point flinging and then back to electricity.  Well, but that's not a bad idea.  I set up like dummies of like Thomas Edison and Henry Ford.  And I'm like, and these idiots stole that idea.  And I do like pressure points on the dummies.  So people get like a cathartic experience watching me elbow smash Henry Ford and his temple.  And if I could really get money, if I really had big money, I'd make it so that each area  you hit them, the dummy would do the exact thing that a person would do if you smash 
[03:38:30]  him in that area.  So if you smash him in the temple, it would make you set up, the wire would be set up  so his legs would collapse.  So you're actually creating an invention in the invention show.  And then people steal it and then you go to Broadway and everyone in the Lion King is  robotic.  I've had a lot of, I have had a lot of good inventions.  You have?  Yeah.  Like what?  I've thought of many inventions in my life.  Most of them are actually very lazy things about not getting out of bed and just reaching  with these long like prongs to get stuff.  That was one of my early days. 
[03:39:00]  I didn't want to get out of bed when I was like eight.  How can I get my tissue box?  Yeah.  I was like, oh, if you had a prong, like, you know, it all started when I worked at the  supermarket.  I saw, you know, those forceps they have in the supermarket.  This is just like what you're talking about with your show, though.  You didn't invent it.  You saw the guys at the supermarket and now you're home thinking, I have this invention.  Well, I'll give you some real examples then.  What about this?  Say this is back, especially nowadays when smoking is forbidden everywhere.  Let's say you're in a car driving in Minnesota.  It's very cold. 
[03:39:30]  It's winter and you want to have a cigarette and the other people in the car don't want  you to smoke.  It always causes a conflict.  So more so in the old days, but people smoke, but there's still a lot of smokers in Michigan.  Michigan people smoke like beasts.  Believe me.  Right.  The whole state smokes.  So it was like a gas mask where you put the cigarette in the gas mask and then it's  got a tube that you just have to crack the window open slightly and the tube goes out  there and the smoke goes right out of the window.  It's the worst invention ever. 
[03:40:00]  The worst invention ever?  Yeah.  Well, I have more.  I have more.  That was an early one.  Because the good thing about smoking cigarettes, you get kind of free and you're out in the  open and you're holding it.  But this is better.  You don't even have to hold the cigarette.  Now you're in a gas mask while you're driving a car?  No, you're not driving.  You're the passenger.  And you don't have to hold the cigarette.  You can text while you're smoking.  But you can't even see it through your...  What do you mean?  No, the gas mask only goes up to the mid-nose. 
[03:40:30]  Like a sleep apnea thing?  Yeah.  It's not a full mask on your eyes, Tom.  It's a terrible idea.  I don't know.  I'll bring that on Shark Tank.  Let's see what they have to say about it.  I don't like on Shark Tank, anytime you say you want to make it in the U.S., they say,  ah, it'll never work.  You're out of here.  Yeah, I know.  Right?  Oh, you're right.  It's brutal.  I never even thought about that.  Yeah.  But it is the truth, you know?  Yeah.  I mean, it's really scary when you think about what...  Yeah, you're not allowed to make things. 
[03:41:00]  You're not allowed to make things.  And it's accepted.  And nobody's afraid to say it.  Right.  That's just scary.  Yeah, it's terrifying.  They just say, no, that's it.  That's a given.  I was just driving through upstate New York and Massachusetts, and it's just town after  town of abandoned factories.  Yeah.  Just...  And the towns are crummy now, too.  Yes.  And you know, this was one time that factory was cranking out pots.  Yeah.  And these people were making the pots, and people were going to schools, and now it's a  ghost land.  Yeah, and people were, and it was, and it was, as corny as it sounds, the backbone of 
[03:41:30]  America.  Yeah.  It set a psychological...  It was talking about energy.  Yeah.  Maybe my show really will be about energy.  Because, well, I mean, as I meant by saying people throw at each other, I just wanted the  energy to somehow transfer into my hands, into a killer's hands.  Yeah, but on a bigger scale.  On a bigger scale, energy is really important.  And yeah, and the energy of this country, all these small towns are gone.  You're right.  Yeah.  And even big cities, I mean, I've been, the two biggest examples, Erie, Pennsylvania,  Springfield, Ohio. 
[03:42:00]  Uh-huh.  I'm talking about a half mile each one of these abandoned factories.  Giant factories.  Yeah, that were cranking.  And rails that were cranking, and they're both, and they're both totally empty.  There's not even security guards there anymore.  Yeah.  They're just empty, and there's miles of them.  I know.  And Detroit, of course, is the greatest example, you know.  And there was a pride in the people, that you actually had a purpose.  Right, of course.  And you're part of the community.  You're part of the community, yeah.  And now we're just kind of wandering around.  Yeah.  And even if you have a job, it's like, guys want to work in like, you know, some job like 
[03:42:30]  that.  They don't want to be working in the local little store.  I mean, they'll do it.  But it's like.  Yeah.  But what do you do?  Once technology starts to advance, what do you do?  Yeah.  It's not just foreign, you know.  But what do you do?  I mean, things are still being manufactured, but they're.  But this is what I'm saying.  We have a whole system in place that doesn't, that, that, that doesn't.  Nobody sits down and goes, hey, guys, we have a problem.  Let's sit down as a country and try to figure it out.  Let's sit down as a country. 
[03:43:00]  Instead of saying, oh, is this fault?  Is that?  Nobody ever sits down at these.  Hey, what about this?  A constitutional convention every couple of years.  Right.  And you bring in all the business leaders, too.  And this is all on C-SPAN.  We go, what do we do about this?  Right.  You guys want to make money.  We want people to have jobs.  What do we do?  And have everybody discuss it.  But that'll never happen.  Yeah.  It's unfortunate.  People do do it to a degree, but.  It's really.  Not in public.  Even like when you have these big tragedies that happen and everybody.  Like Oklahoma City.  Yeah.  Or.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Jesus. 
[03:43:30]  Imagine you just living your life.  Yeah.  In some little place.  And just.  The wind blows through.  Yeah.  Good Lord.  But whenever there's something big happens, you think, okay, now we're going to sit down  and talk and really come up with a solution.  And it's like the two parties are like, I feel like we're the children of alcoholic parents.  Right.  And they're like, yeah, we're going to take care of you.  And then they just take out each other and they manipulate each other and nothing happens.  And they go back to drinking alone.  But even if they didn't, I'm saying it's bigger than them now.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  The Constitutional Convention needs also all the business, all the shapers of the people  that, you know.  Yeah.  All the business people.  Yeah.  You need this all together.  But like you said, it's a good example.  But can you, can you, is there a solution to, I mean, we've moved into this technological  future.  Right.  And you see these small towns in Ohio and New York, is there hope, what could you do  for those, you're never going to go back to a manufacturing society like that. 
[03:44:30]  Right.  So what.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  That's what these big constitutional conventions would be about.  I know, but you studied the Constitution.  You have a show about it.  But the Constitution, but I didn't study the economy of the United States, for Christ's  sakes.  Yeah, but you're smart.  You can figure it out.  I mean, we can't talk about the Rust Belt and it ended in 1975, really.  I know.  You know what I mean?  Right, exactly.  But yeah, I mean, we became, we became a, all whole economy now is based on the, you  know, this, this kind of, you know, non-existent like financials and stuff like that.  Yeah, and service.  The only thing we could do probably would be if you had somebody like me in charge, I'd 
[03:45:00]  be like a, like, I mean, if you look at the most effective people in history, we're  talking about Joseph Stalin, a great leader, very underrated man.  Mussolini.  Mussolini.  Mussolini.  What's his name?  Pol Pot.  What's his name?  Like, he's the guy at the deli.  Yes.  Genocide dares, a very important part of society.  The, well, actually, you know who they said was really smart was that, what's his name? 
[03:45:30]  Milosevic, that guy from Serbia that was the evil one.  Oh, yeah?  They said he was smart.  Really?  They said he, he was just, he played it so cool when the UN and all those people came  in, he didn't play it like any other dictator.  He's like, hey, guys, we're trying to, he kept it like semi-open.  Uh-huh.  He was doing his heinous things.  Jeez.  And he always dealt with them.  He's like, he tried to make himself the victim.  And he got away with a lot of stuff for a couple of years.  Wow.  While he's doing these horrible, horrible, I mean, genocide.  That's the scariest thing when you've got to play it. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, when those, when super smart people are evil.  But I'll tell you who's good.  The guy in Indonesia before Suharto named Sukarno, this guy was good.  He was a benevolent dictator.  He lived in a little house.  He gave the people stuff, but he still was a benevolent.  He still had an iron fist when you need it.  Sometimes you need it.  But his problem was he let his family and his friends, they all started exploiting the  system and robbing.  He was like a down-to-earth guy.  Didn't take anything.  But he let his, he spoiled his family and friends and they robbed the place and became 
[03:46:30]  these despots.  That's what happened to MC Hammer.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  You're listening to Come to Pop on Sirius XM 99.  I'm here with the great Colin Quinn.  And we're doing a special show because he has an off-Broadway show called Unconstitutional.  It's running at the Barrow Street Theater in downtown Manhattan on Barrow Street.  Perfect, perfect theater.  Perfect spot.  It's a hilarious show.  I saw it.  Every comedian that came out of there was like, I can't believe he even did better than  his last show.  And you can get tickets at ColinQuinnunconstitutional.com. 
[03:47:00]  It's an amazing show.  Do you, how much research do you do when you're going, when you're going to tackle a subject  like this?  Do you read a lot before you start getting into it?  First of all, before we answer that question, let's go back to one more statement where  you go, perfect, perfect, perfect theater.  And then the whole time I hear you, I'm busting my balls.  Why don't you move it to Broadway?  I'm not saying move it to Broadway.  Right now.  Well, I, you're right.  Woo.  You are right.  But there is that thing.  And I, I guess, I guess we're all, it's like when you see somebody and you're like, why 
[03:47:30]  aren't you making movies?  You always figure like they should big, do the big splashy thing.  I know.  But meanwhile, and I don't, and to be honest, I also brought it up because I know, because  we're friends that you didn't like Broadway.  And I was hoping it was going to lead to you talking about why Broadway blew.  Crashing Broadway.  No, Broadway's great if you, you know, if you're Christian Chenoweth or somebody like  that, it's not my dream, you know?  Right.  But I mean, it's, I've been there a couple of times.  And honestly, if I, if it hadn't been my dream, I would have been petrified to do it.  Thank God I didn't care about Broadway.  So both times I did, I was like, hey, Broadway, but I don't even think in terms, I just think 
[03:48:00]  in terms of it's a theater.  Right.  You know, like I was like that off Broadway, like the public theater.  Right.  And, um.  Yeah, so it wasn't a big deal to you.  Right.  It wasn't like, oh, Broadway, or else I would have been scared.  I would have been horrified.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Who are you to come on Broadway by yourself?  Yeah.  And I didn't think about it in Broadway terms.  Right.  Let's go.  Thank God, you know?  But, um.  But do you do?  Yeah, I do a lot of research.  Do you do?  Well, I mean, because of Google, research is a little bit slippery now.  But, you know, you research, you just keep reading, like I keep reading these Constitution 
[03:48:30]  books, and then it's torture to read them, you know?  Yeah.  Because they're written in that old language, and it's just, oh, boring.  Right.  They're from a time when you didn't have any choice, and you just have to read, you  know?  Right.  But then, but then your consciousness, you try to go, wait a minute, but you try to put  yourself in their shoes.  Like, what was the angle?  Why were they saying this?  Right.  Why were they doing this?  And it's like, yeah, it's not to be England is a big one, to not be like England.  Like, the psychological motivation is behind everything.  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  It's like, why are you doing this?  Why are you doing this?  Why would they say this?  And so, it all makes sense, and then it's behind a...  That's a great angle, just because I still have, like a school kid way of looking at history,  where I think of these people as bigger, older, more archaic.  And then you realize, from watching your show, it's like, they're just guys.  Right.  They're just human beings, just like...  Yeah.  And about...  Like we are.  Probably 12 of them were geniuses.  Yeah.  And the other guys are just, like, local, successful guys that are sitting there going, 
[03:49:30]  oh my God, I'm out of my league with these geniuses, and I'm trying to get my thing in,  you know, I can't go back to my state, and you coward, you didn't even get us anything,  so you have to, like, be forceful, but at the same time, you're in the room with Ben  Franklin and Madison, and you have to be, like, you know...  Was it...  Were you more impressed after studying about all this stuff, or were you impressed by this  kind of a stroke of luck that all these great minds actually did get together? 
[03:50:00]  Was there something special about that moment with these guys?  When you say there's, like, 12 geniuses, that's a lot of geniuses.  Yes!  No, I mean, it was definitely...  I think it was also brought out, because the British brought it out in them by the oppression,  and the fact that they didn't notice, it was 100 years into the country already, 150  years ago, and they didn't notice, like, hey, there's some...  It happens all the time, and it's part of the new show about energy, because you don't  notice, you're building up, you know, just when you... 
[03:50:30]  Well, like, let's take stand-up comedy, the only thing I actually know anything about,  sadly.  Well, like, while you're sitting there going, oh, you know, stand-up, it's kind of petered off,  and suddenly, in the past six years, boom, all these funny young comics, and you're  like, wow, I thought all the material was covered.  I didn't think anybody could be coming up with this much new material.  I thought you'd come up with some new stuff, technological stuff, but psychological stuff,  too, and you're watching all these people working, and you're going, oh, you know, 
[03:51:00]  and it's the same thing.  It's like, England thought they had it locked, they had this brilliant society, they came  up with all these brilliant people, and they're like, yeah, and then suddenly,  they're just like, America, and then, holy crap, and then we had a whole literature thing  in the 1890s, I mean, it was a lot going, all the inventions, the car, the plane, the  tractor, the, you know, chicken wire, I mean, it was like, all this stuff that really was  effective for my invention show, you know?  Did you, uh...  Electricity?  Did anyone emerge as the most impressive to you out of that time? 
[03:51:30]  Was it Ben Franklin or Madison?  Yeah, Ben Franklin was pretty amazing.  Ben Franklin?  Ben Franklin?  Amazing.  Why was he so amazing?  Just because he was like, on the, because he was, on the one hand, he always had like,  he was always writing thousands of, he wrote all these new words for the dictionary, and  he's always inventing things, and then he's political the entire time, and he's like a  statesman, and at the same time, he's a pervert, and he's always like at sex clubs, and he's  drunk the whole time, it's like, who was this guy at the end?  He lived to, he was 82 at the convention.  Jeez.  He was like the oldest guy, and he was doing it all. 
[03:52:00]  He was 82 at the convention.  He was 82 at that convention, he was like the old, old, old guy.  And, but it's like, this guy did it all, like his whole life, he was a pervert, and  a drunk, and an inventor, and a statesman.  God.  I mean.  I saw an interesting thing that he used to do with his writing.  Did you ever hear this?  He would write, to exercise, to get out of, just this, make sure that he wasn't just stayed  and writing the same way.  He would write in the voice of other great writers of the time.  Like he would be, let me write about this subject as Jefferson would write about it, or let 
[03:52:30]  me write about this, as Mattis, right?  To just change his way of.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Pretty great.  So I've been writing all my stand-up, like you.  But that's a good idea.  But don't you think when you start stand-up, you do write in a voice of the people you like?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I actually did it.  When I read it about a month ago, and I actually sat down, I was working on this bit, and  about nature, how Mother Nature hates us now and is coming after us. 
[03:53:00]  Right.  And I wrote it as Bernie Mac.  I wrote it as Brian Regan.  Wow.  And it was pretty interesting.  You can kind of get into their rhythm.  That's really interesting.  And did you try that on stage?  No.  Why not?  There's part two of the experiment is the experiment itself.  Well, I felt weird going up there and talking as Bernie Mac.  Well, you have to talk as him.  I'm saying talking back as you now with that rhythm of the material, like those jokes.  Did you use them or no?  Yeah. 
[03:53:30]  I pulled something out.  And are they working?  Yeah, they are working.  Isn't that wild?  Yeah.  That's really cool.  Yeah, it is pretty cool.  I like that kind of...  Well, maybe that's what this show should be.  The energy force, what Ben Franklin did with language, I'll say, why don't you people try  looking at some of our enemies in their voice?  And they go to a Russian accent.  I come to America.  I want to nuclear you.  And everyone's like, wow, he really hit a deep point there.  I want a nuclear you. 
[03:54:00]  I want a more nuclear you.  Yeah, but it is interesting.  I mean, what do people always say?  Nobody can ever really see anybody else's side.  Once you get into an energy, where you're like, that's it.  Don't...  Right.  Your frown goes down, and people get in.  And now they always say, how you observe things changes the actual thing of it.  What is that theory called?  Where you observe things.  Right.  And your attitude when you're observing things changes the actual physical thing.  I forget what it's called.  It's like some principle. 
[03:54:30]  So me observing...  Give me an example.  Like, if you're observing...  Like, if you're sitting there with your kid...  I mean, I don't even know if this is true.  Okay.  But this is the...  I forget what it's called.  But if you're observing your kids...  Yeah.  And you're sitting there thinking...  Nervous...  You're giving off a nervous energy, like, don't fall.  Right.  Don't fall.  Uh-huh.  I won't say the kids' names, because, you know, you never know.  There's all kinds of serial killers around this world.  Don't fall.  And then you...  One of your sons or daughters, Tom, falls on some street in a major city. 
[03:55:00]  Right.  And you know what I'm saying?  You've made it happen.  Like, you've...  Right.  Your energy has helped create it to happen.  Right.  That's what I mean.  I believe that.  So...  Like, whenever my wife or husband...  Right.  ...says to the kids, are you sick?  Are you getting sick?  Well, that's definitely true.  Right?  That stuff is...  The verbal stuff is a whole other act. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  But I'm saying not even...  Even that speaking...  Just wondering if they're sick.  Right.  If you say, oh, yeah, that verbal stuff is all true.  Right.  How many people...  I've had so many friends in my life that if you saw them over the...  And I remember not realizing what their problem was.  I'm talking about...  I had a friend who was, like, a big, handsome kid.  You know, like, just popular guy.  And his whole life, he only surrounded himself with people...  Little pipsqueak people that we call him a loser and call him...  And I was like...  First of all, he could have snatched any one of them and killed them. 
[03:56:00]  Second of all, every girl was throwing themselves out of this.  Right.  Like a star, you know, a star, just a person.  But, I mean...  Yeah.  And he always wanted to be around that because, you know, it reminded him of his childhood,  his comfort.  Interesting.  Sitting there eating his cereals.  As a little kid, you're a loser.  And he was surrounded himself with all these people.  And I was like, what are you doing?  You should beat his phrase and he should be banging her.  Yeah, right.  And he's like, oh, you know...  He's like...  He sort of knew it, too.  He wasn't totally out of it.  Do you...  You have a real confidence when you go into these projects.  And I know this from walking around talking to you as it's getting closer. 
[03:56:30]  And I can actually feel your energy gaining momentum.  And you're like, no, I'm...  You go from like, I'm working this out.  I'm really working.  I'm hard.  Right.  And then when you get close, it's like, no, I'm putting the show up.  No, I'm going with the show.  No, I'm ready to go with the show.  And it's just like there's a momentum that is coming up.  Do you...  Is that just a natural thing in you?  Or do you conjure it up with affirmations?  No.  I honestly feel that if I do all the work, like halfway through this show, 
[03:57:00]  everybody was kind of coming...  The people that saw it were kind of like, hey, man, it's a good idea.  Like, everybody gets nervous for you because, you know, it's like stand-up.  Right.  It's like, eh, it's not working.  It's like a stand-up bit.  It's not working.  You have to be...  The only thing we have is you have to be totally like, guess what?  I'm the one.  I'll be up there alone.  Right.  If I don't believe in this, if I don't really do the work and then believe it's all I got,  it's all my work is there.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's all I got. 
[03:57:30]  So if it doesn't work, I don't have any regrets.  Right.  Because I know that that was everything I had.  It's a little...  It'll be embarrassing.  It's humiliating when you do your best work and it fails.  Right.  But guess what?  Too bad.  I'd rather do that.  So I get into...  I get into a space where it starts to work and I'm like...  I start to feel confident when I start seeing it work.  Right.  If it fails, I'm in that other mode where I'm in early on where I'm like, oh, I don't know.  Right.  So it's not like I...  But you're aware of it.  I don't kid myself, but it's like, yeah, once I start getting laughs at the comedy clubs 
[03:58:00]  with little bits about the Constitution, I'm like, if that worked there out of context,  this has to be all right, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  But yeah.  But also, it's like you have to commit.  You have to put both feet in.  Like if I went up the night you saw me, any night, it's the same as stand-up.  If you go up any night and you're like, hey, guys, you'll make this decision for me, I'm  kind of tentative.  You're dead.  Right.  You have to go up there and go, look, this is it.  This is hilarious.  And if it fails, you were in there both feet.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You can't be...  It's not for the... 
[03:58:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  There's a lot of times when you see comedians go up and they...  It's like they don't have the confidence and the conviction in what they're saying.  Right.  And it's...  You almost have to be...  You have to walk up there and say, I've got this opinion and there is no wiggle room.  I'm not asking for you whether this is right.  This is how it is.  Yeah.  Even if your opinion is about how you don't understand, there should be wiggle room.  Right.  Even if your opinion is that, you've got to say it.  You've got to really believe everything you say. 
[03:59:00]  It has to be...  Right.  It has to be important.  And that's an energy thing too.  Total energy.  Because then you're bringing in energy to that room and all of a sudden...  It's an energy thing like nothing else.  Yeah.  Because we both know guys that have nothing.  Nothing material-wise.  Right.  I've known in my whole career guys that bring no...  Very few jokes.  Yeah.  Much less jokes than a guy that has great jokes.  And they kill every night.  They bring it.  Right.  They bring that energy.  Yeah.  No.  And then you have guys with great jokes who are just kind of like... 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  They go up there and they're just basically, you know, kind of like living and dying on the audience's opinion of each joke.  Right.  They've got great jokes.  Yeah.  And they just ruin themselves.  They won't move around and they get stuck in that space.  Yeah.  Physically too where they're just standing there.  You know what I mean?  No.  It's interesting because when you see what's happening to stand-up and the people are cranking out a lot more material now that people are...  Right.  There's a...  Because there's so many outlets to... </pre>
